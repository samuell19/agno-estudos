How long have they locked up this room? Very long. It's deserted and creepy. Is there anything worth taking? The professor said we can take anything we want to use. What is it? Class 37? They wouldn't mind if we take it? They won't. Just take it. LAST CHEER That's nice, Shin. Cool. Take photos for me. - Stop nagging me. - But it's nice here. Later. Tai! Who's that? Here's the application to the cheerleading team. Fill it out and give it to the seniors. Yes. Give me a pen. Again? Thanks... Fay and... I'm Shin. But call me Shinny, it's cuter. Shinny, I'm Tai. Are you keen to join? I've never been a cheerleader before. I'll need your advice. Easy-peasy. You just wave your hands back and forth and use your good looks to command attention. Have you joined the class's chat group? I'll invite you. Sure. Who's that? That's Maysa, my friend. Oh, right. Call her here. The book you want to borrow me. Hold it for me, now come. This is Maysa, my friend from high school. This is Fay and Shin. Hi, I'm Shin, I mean I'm Fay! And I'm Shin. I like your wavy hair. Yeah, it's so nice, like... wavy. Shin, you want me to take your photos? - Yeah, over there. - Let's go. Don't be too picky. Sorry, just a sec. The view is nice there. Yes, it's nice. I thought we'd come up here to read. We can read later. Is this still our secret place? Sure is, but we can share it with others sometimes. Tai! It's so nice up here, we should get more people to hang out here later. All right! Thanks Cool! You got 10K "Likes"! Are you okay with that? No problem. The rituals are about to start. Tai, the seniors want us in the common room, let's go. Go now or they'll bark at us. We have to practice the song. We can pick another place if you'd like. This café is cute, I'll ask Maysa again. We can go just you and me. I want someone to take my photos. I took like 2,000 photos of you at the last café we went. And how many did you post? Well, one. Have you been a cheerleader before? Yes. You guys go head. Is she all right? She's like that. Sometimes she'd just zone out, I'll catch you up later. No, we can wait with you. It'll take a while. You go now before the seniors chew your head off. Yeah, we should go. See you in the common room then. Okay. Why did you go in there? Did I? I didn't realize... Remember what I told you at the orientation? We have to act normal. Yes. Look, I even applied to the cheerleading team. Don't worry. I'll have your back if anything happens. I'm scared. Can't it just be only you and me? No! We're in college now, no one knows about our past. You can do it. Let's go. Let's hurry. Proper uniform, everyone. Keep walking. Tuck your shirts in and roll your sleeves down. I'm Fay. What's your name? I'm Bua. Hi, I'm Shinny. Did we meet at the orientation? You remember me? Your lip color is cute. Look, we'll have to rate the quality of our new environment. You mean new friends? I mean hot guys. Duh. Speaking of which, look at that yummy hunk. Husband material, his name's Ninew. Hey, he's giving me the eye. Do I look pretty today? He's still looking at me. Yeah, he is. - He fancies me. - Whatever. - He really likes me. - Okay, he digs you. Tai! Can my friends squeeze in here? Thanks. If you see anything, just ignore it. Hello freshies! Welcome to our fraternity night! We're the seniors who'll supervise our activity today. My name's Nuch. This is Cho, our team captain this year. Any problem you can come to us, all right? Our first activity is simple. You'll practice our school anthem together. If you make a mistake, the drum will stop and you'll have to start over until all of you can sing as one. We also have an ex-senior observing us today. His name's Ming. Hi. What's an "ex-senior"? Someone who graduated years ago. And doesn't he have anything better to do? - No, that's why the loser sticks around. - We'll sing it for you once. You can find the lyrics in your phone or on this board. ♪ When you're weary, we'll be your strength ♪ ♪ When you're lonely, we'll be your friends ♪ ♪ When you fall down, reach out your hand so we'll gather you up ♪ ♪ Together our spirits become one ♪ ♪ Together we believe with all our hearts ♪ ♪ We'll brave through all obstacles ♪ ♪ Our bond is eternal ♪ ♪ Hard times cannot vanquish our united soul ♪ ♪ Together we'll never fail ♪ ♪ Together we'll fight as one ♪ ♪ Together we'll brave through the harsh world ♪ So that's it.

Cho. Let's take a 15. But don't go anywhere. Stay here. You feel better out here? I'm sorry. It's happening again. It's all right. We've been through this before. I remember that time during the swimming class when I had to watch over you. You told me to skip class it was my first time doing it. Are you as afraid now as you were then? Not really. Look, they say Maysa can see ghosts. So... she saw something here. Drowning... Traditional dance in the school building... Sounds creepy. Do you think it was real? No, she was acting. But her scream was horrifying. How many incense sticks? Dunno. Google it. Me? What do I search? What are we praying to? Just light 3. I have more than 3. - Three sticks are for monks. - How is she? - Let's go with 3 sticks. - What's wrong with her... Look, they're fighting. What's wrong with her? Why didn't you talk to her? I don't know, but she doesn't seem up to it. What do your mean, huh? Hey. Your hands are cold. I'll get you a jacket. I think... I should leave. I'm bound to ruin the practice again. Okay. Can you wait here by yourself. It's fine here. I'll go talk to the seniors and find you a jacket. When she screamed, did she see a ghost? She totally freaked out. What? Tai. How's Maysa? Not good. She wants to go home, I'll go ask the seniors. Can she go? Then I want to go too. It's spooky here. So, what's wrong with Maysa? Tai... You can be frank with us. Maysa can see ghosts, right? Everyone is talking about it. It's just a mean gossip. Gossip? But it seems pretty credible what people are talking. Like the story of the swimming pool. You've been with her since high school, right? She's a bit of a loner, so she was bullied a lot. They spread this ghost nonsense to hurt her. So can you explain what just happened? She's not well. What else do you want to hear? Not well? With what, exactly? What do want from her? If she really can see ghosts, you guys will stop being her friends? Can I borrow your cardigan? Explain it! She's just texted me. She wants to go home. And will you let her? I think we should. What about the others? Should we let them go too? But she was scared stiff. Oh really? What exactly is wrong with her? I don't know, but she's really in a bad shape. You don't know? Then who does, huh? Now what? So our rituals lasted only 20 minutes? I thought I'd lay low this year. But you guys suck. I'll let her rest in the back with us. But she wants to go home. This is the best for now. It's your call. What do they tell you? Can I just run away? Not now. I just talked to Nuch. She's probably discussing it with the other seniors. Put this on. Hey, you. Well... I know you're not feeling well. I'm concerned. But the show must go on. I'll allow Maysa to take a break and hang back with us. But I want to go home. Girl. Girl. What's your problem? - My friend's not feeling well. - Are you her interpreter? I'm asking her, not you What's your problem, huh? Is there a name for your condition? If you don't talk, I can't help you. Maysa, we'll be done in an hour. It's stuffy in here, she feels suffocated. Suffocated? Hey, open the curtain for her. Is it better now? Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you! I can't! There's a ghost right in front of you! In front of me? You mean... Right here? Like, can I smack its head like this? Like this? Well, listen up. The thing is, this girl wants to go home. She wants to quit. But if I allow her to leave, then everyone should be able to leave too. Since we're living in a democracy... Cho, that's your thing, right? Democracy. So let's put this to a vote. Any of you who wants to leave the ritual and go home, Raise your hand. Raise your hand if you want to go home. You can see ghosts, right? Anyone else can see ghosts here? Anyone? If just one of you admits you can see ghosts, I'll let you all go home. Come on, if you believe there's a ghost here. Raise your hand Just one hand raised, and we're done. Anyone? Raise your hand! Hand! Nada. What about you? Can you see ghosts? Answer me. You should leave. Both of you. We can continue without these two. Girl! Maysa. Maysa. Is that you? Maysa. Maysa! Maysa, what're you doing here? Why didn't you help me? I've been helping you. Why didn't you tell him you can see ghosts? Because if they know. - We'll... - Stop making an excuse. Couldn't you just tell him you're like me? Why do you care what other people think? I care, because I don't want to look like a freak! Don't you know you're a freak? Then you are, too. We both are. We both are freaks. Yes, we're freaks, that's why I've been trying. I want to be normal, don't you get it? You're not the only one who's scared of ghosts. I'm scared too, but I force myself to ignore them. Why can't you do the same? You can't say I never tried. I did try. But I couldn't do it! I'm not like you. Every time you told me you'd help me become normal. I get it. But when you abandoned me like that... Abandoned you? How could you say that? I've always had your back! Whenever I make new friends, I bring you along to cheer you up. I've done everything I could. Everything. I've supported you until I have nothing left. You know I want to live a normal life. To hang out with friends, to travel like everyone does. But why is it so difficult? I'm so damn tired. Maysa. Let's start over. You're the only friend I have. Of course. I'll be right here. I'll never leave you alone in this world, okay? Come down here, so we can talk. Don't do this. You'll only make it worse. Come down here. When you treated me like you treated the ghosts it hurt me more than when I saw those ghosts. From now on, when you see me. Don't ignore me like you ignore them. Maysa! Someone has jumped off the roof! Call an ambulance! I'm sorry. Maysa, come read with me. This movie contains scenes with flashing lights. This may cause physical reaction in sensitive people. Hi, this is Pre-Med Show, Season 3. I'm Tang. I'm here to share tips for those who want to enter med schools. Starting with your responsibility... Hello... Now, what health conditions might stop you from becoming a doctor? First off, epilepsy. If the condition is mild and can be controlled, then there's no problem. But if it's severe... Are you sleeping on Bed C? Careful, the real owner may return like he did every year. He was a first-year med student like us. On the night he came back, no one dared to stay in the dorm. Even the security guys. You know why? He got ran over by a car on the night of the 30th anniversary of the college's founding. They say... he still wanted to continue his studies. So every year on the anniversary night, He would come back to the dorm and walk into the room with Bed C. His bed. So if you don't want to see him... You stayed up or you just woke up? What a nerd. Turn off the light. "28th COLLEGE'S FOUNDING DAY" "29th QUIZ DAY, DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT" THE C Hi Tang. I didn't know your podcast... has ghost stories. Only that EP. For your ears only. Oh, I already forwarded it to the professor with the other files. What? Are you serious? Yes. You're pulling my leg. Ghost stories will help you stay awake. See, you're too scared to stay in the room, right? Not at all. Tan, do you have something to tell me? No, I don't. The quiz is tomorrow evening. You have time to go home and study. It's quiet here. I can concentrate more. But... what if the ghost shows up? The last bus is at 10pm. I'll study until then and go home. But you can leave first. Don't wait for me. It'll be late. You want me to go alone again. It's no big deal. Don't sulk. I'm not. I just feel lonely. Tan, how about this? All medical students, it's time to declare an oath of ethical behavior and commitment to the medical profession. "70th ANNIVERSARY OF COLLEGE OF MEDICINE" As member of the medical profession I pledge to dedicate my life to serve humanity. I pledge to conduct my professional duty with conscience and dignity. I will regard the health of my patients as top priority. I will protect the honor, dignity and tradition of the medical profession. My fellow practitioners are my blood brothers. In the face of a threat, I pledge to uphold the value of the human life. I will not exploit my professional knowledge in ways that are immoral. I will respect the right to life of patients, fellow humans, and of myself. Next, we will hand out the 70th anniversary commemorative pins to all of you. May this pin remind you of your oath to respect the right to life of patients, of fellow humans, and of yourself. So you're not going home? No. I'm off then, good luck. Tan, watch your back, okay? Why don't you study at home? "MALE COLLEGE STUDENT DORMITORY" There are many factors, that can trigger seizures. Such as stress... Sleep deprivation or flashing lights. But in severe cases, such as having an hour-long seizure followed by temporary hemiparesis or full-bodied paralysis, the patient needs a thorough diagnosis and an EEG test or by MRI before a course of treatment can be determined. Doctors who have severe epilepsy and whose condition might harm the patients, such as having a seizure while performing an operation will likely to be disqualified from specialized practices. If the condition cannot be medically alleviated, they will not be allowed to perform an operation. So you really came. You said you'd stay, so I'll stay and study with you until 10 p.m. You want my help with the text? I'm good. Maybe... I should sleep here. Really? Aren't you scared of ghosts? I'm more scared of you. That's funny. Hyperventilation is abnormally rapid breathing caused by mental panic and not by physical conditions. Level of Co2 is also a factor. As well as flashing lights... But in severe cases, such as having an hour-long seizure the patient needs a thorough diagnosis and an EEG test. If the condition cannot be medically treated, they will not be allowed to perform an operation. Tang. Please be quiet. I'm beat. I want to study in peace. Are you sure you don't have anything to tell me? Yeah. You can tell me everything. Tang Tang, listen. I said it's nothing. I just want to be alone. How could you say that? I've always been by your side. I... I really want to be alone. Remember what you said to me? You said you wanted to be a doctor so you could look after me. You still want to do that? I'm sorry. Tang. Tang. Tang. Many factors can trigger seizures. Stress, sleep deprivation, or flashing lights. Tang! Shit! Is that you? Tang. This is not funny. Tang. Tang. Don't do this. If you don't want him to come, write "No Bed C here" on a piece of paper and put it outside the door. But no one knows if the trick is foolproof. I'm home. No need to call. The only foolproof trick is... Let's go home together! Let's go home, pleaseeee. No Bed C here Shit! No Bed C here Bed C here "30th ANNIVERSARY" "70th ANNIVERSARY" May this pin remind you of your oath... I pledge to dedicate my life to serving humanity... to respect the right to life... They say... he still wanted to continue his studies. "30th ANNIVERSARY" I will protect the honor and tradition of the medical profession. My fellow practitioners are my blood brothers. In the face of a threat, I will respect the value of the human life. From womb to tomb, I... will not exploit my knowledge in ways that are immoral. I... will respect the right to life of patients of fellow humans, and of myself. Calling Tang... Tang. Tang. I have something to tell you. I have epilepsy. It's severe. I don't think I can become a doctor. I'm sorry I didn't tell you before. I'm sorry for acting weird. Honestly, I've always wanted to be with you I really want to do what I promised to you. I'm sorry. Tang. Are you there? Tan... You don't have to be a doctor. I still want you to look after me. You guys know... why our school had to move out of the old Science building. But have you heard about what happened... one night at the walkway? THE ABANDONED Faculty of Science Faculty of Science They say... a vile she-ghost has resided in the iron wood sign for centuries. Anyone who disrespects it, especially at night, will pay a dear price. Well, can I ask you something? If there's a ghost in the iron wood sign what about rusty iron wood? Does the ghost turn rusty too? Is that the wittiest joke you can come up with? Let's say, if we use the very same iron wood to make signs for... Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Fisheries, Faculty of Astrology, Will the vile she-ghost split her ghostly atoms so she can haunt every one of them? I think the seniors who made our sign must have anticipated a pain in the neck like you and decided to make just one sign, to end all problems. May. You just disrespected the ghost. You'd better watch your back. - Yeah. - I was just curious. Why so serious? You'll see. And you, Meen, enough with ghost stories. Finish your lab paper or you won't graduate and become another ghost haunting this school. Aoi Forever. Text me back, please. Meen. Hi Mom. Ten minutes late and you're already on my ass. I need my laptop now. You don't. Why? A college dropout isn't worthy of your laptop? You can use it. But not to Photoshop pictures for girls without telling me. Sis, I've had a bad day. Scraped my bike against a pole. And shit keeps hitting the fan. Oh, tough day. What happened exactly? Aoi didn't text me back all day. In one day, my whole world crumbles. A delivery rider is condemned to a life without a future. Wait. Is this the girl you've met 2 weeks ago? Golf, get your act together before thinking about getting a girl! So it's a tie! You have no boyfriend and I have no future. Whatever, dumb-ass. Where are you now? I'm right in front of some sign... Con-gra-tu-la-ti-on-s. Bring the computer to me now! You can do that, right? Shit, which way now? Text me back, dearest Aoi. Let's start over. I'll do my best this time. Faculty of Science. Finally! Must be this way. I haven't finished the story of the old Science building. On the ground floor, there's a glass cabinet. With the graduation gown inside? Yes, it's a tribute to one of the students. She was a poor student, and got bullied all the time. So she studied hard, hoping to graduate in 4 years. But in the end, she failed. Distraught that she couldn't achieve her goal, on graduation day, she put on the gown On the eve of every graduation day since, at least one student died an unnatural death at that building. Why do they even display this crappy gown? Earn respect from students with the spirit of teaching. A student once challenged the ghosts there. The next day he was found dead. His guts all over the floor. Gory stuff. You're enjoying this. There's more to the story, guys. This professor was having a recurrent heart attack. Too bad she couldn't find her medicine bottle. So she died. Who the hell left a medicine bottle on the floor? What an asshole. Just my luck. My medicine. "For heart condition" Is this your medicine? I'm sorry, professor. Hey. Are you okay? Are you... "For heart condition" Are you... having a heart attack? Stop. Aoi's text! I've been giving it some thought And I suppose... "For heart condition" that... "For heart condition" that... Give me back my medicine. Come on, professor. Be kind, okay? She's dying right there. Stop thinking about yourself for a second, okay? And what the hell's wrong with this chick? Hey, are you all right? Get over here. Away from the nutty professor. You okay? Is this yours? It might help. Is this a no? Never mind. I will... take you to a hospital. Let's go get my bike, okay? Hello. Golf, what's taking you so long? I'm already at the Science Building. Right in front of the faculty's office. By the way, this building looks like shit. You got the wrong building, idiot. I have to go now. Whoa. You okay? I'll take you to a hospital. But I have to return this laptop to my sister first, okay? Stop screaming, would you? Come on, let's go. Just a sec. She'll be here soon. Told me to hurry and now I have to wait. You know, I admire your spirit. You're sick but you still put on the gown to take photos. Respect. You know what? I used to take graduation day photos for a small fee. My photos are cool. Would you hire me? Any style you want. You're into Goth, right? Ah ha. No budget, huh? Don't worry. No Charge. Covid promotion. You're broke, I see. When you recover, just give me a call. What's wrong? Medicine. You need your medicine. Hang in there. Just a sec. Where is it? What medicine? What took you so long? I'd been waiting for ages. Are you messing with me? Give it here. Ungrateful sis. You went to the old building? Be careful, the ghosts will break your neck. Ghosts? You're a science student, for God's sake! What a waste. Well, I explored the entire building. Not a single ghost in sight. Only a professor and... a senior taking her graduation photos. Who would take photos this late? Are you high? If I don't finish my paper and have to drop out like you, it will be your fault. Dropping out is not a crime. Stop rubbing it in. Are you done? Yeah, done. I have work to do. Good, now go. Can't wait. Where did she go? Hey. You. Where's Meen? Getting the laptop from her brother. Brave girl. She just told us a ghost story and... went off all alone like that. Joy, nothing to be scared of! The ghosts are at the old building, not here! Hey there, you need help? My brother is so dumb he went to the wrong building. Give me back my medicine! What's going on here? The professor-ghost and the grad-gown ghost! Shit! Why are they here? What do they want? Offerings, I guess. The professor is easier to deal with, she just wants her medicine. But where the hell is it? Give me back my medicine! Sup? Is the medicine bottle with you? Come again. Did you take any medicine bottle from the old building? Medicine... Oh yeah. It's in your laptop case. No, it's fucking not. No need to yell. But how do you know about the medicine bottle? Golf, go find it right now. - Someone is dying to have it back. - Give me back my medicine! Where did you lose it? Relax, let me think. You're hungry? Calm down, guys. Let's work it out. If we can't find her meds, we can get her some other meds. Get an app rider to buy it from a store or something. Meen, have your brother go buy it now. Joy, you dork! You're the one who needs to calm down! I've seen a lot of horror films. This ghost is after a specific bottle of meds, she wouldn't take anything else for it. A heart med is a heart med. Old bottle, new bottle. It doesn't matter! Give me back my medicine. Stupid crone, go to hell! How the hell can I find it? Just a small bottle. Hey, there you are. A flower garland? Shit, what now! I don't want to die! Leave us alone, bitches. Split up! She's coming this way. Nooooo! Stop right there! It won't come off. I'm sorry. Come baby, come. She's here! Help me! Five, six, seven, eight. Meen, help me! The door's stuck. Golf Pick up, Golf. Sis, there's a she-ghost at the walkway! The medicine bottle is there, but I can't get past her. You saw the iron-wood ghost? We have the professor and the grad-gown bitch here. Damn, I can't help you. You're on your own. Golf listen, the iron-wood ghost isn't always at the sign. You can do it. I believe in you. What's with all this friggin' thunder!? - What do I do? - If you believe there's nothing, then there's nothing. Right, that's easy for you. Enough with the thunder! Just rain, for fuck's sake! What? Got it? Goddamnit! I'll tell you when I've got it. Okay? Stop calling me, bitch. Fine, I won't call you ever again. Asshole. Aoi. Aoi. Sorry, the number you dial cannot be reached... My beloved Aoi!!! ♪ Is it raining where you are? ♪ My beloved Aoi!!! ♪ Are you fine? ♪ ♪ Are you afraid of thunder? ♪ ♪ Don't worry, I'll come over... ♪ Give me back my medicine! The iron-wood ghost just got me good. I can't do this. You failed again? Why do you have to say that? You think it feels good to keep failing? Run. I'll deal with everything here. Give me back my medicine. It's stuck! Try pushing. You're right. Meen, come! Give me back my medicine. Give me back my medicine. Are we safe now? I'm beat. Look! Ma'am, we're sorry! We didn't mean to lose your medicine! Give me back my medicine. A long life awaits, walk with your head held high. This time I won't fail. Catch! Hey! Why are you doing this? If I don't graduate, no one will. Here. Your gown is a mess. You won't look good in photos. You know... Everybody tells me this faculty is so damn hard to graduate from. I wouldn't make it past the first semester. But you've come this far. I'm really proud of you. You made it. You've graduated. Con-gra-tu-la-ti-on-s. As promised, smile. One, two, three. Okay, time to go... make up with your Aoi. It's probably too late. Hey, girls are like that. She'll forgive you. Though I think... maybe you should let her go. You deserve someone better. Yeah, I'm done with her. Umm, you said you're proud of that grad-gown ghost. What about me? Are you proud of me? Yeah, sure. Honestly, I want to be a good student like you. Hey, Golf. Dropping out doesn't mean your life is over. Life is much more than that. There's plenty of opportunities out there. Yeah. Now go back to your lab. I'm going home. Ride safely. What was that? It's con-gra-tu-la-tions, dumb-ass.
