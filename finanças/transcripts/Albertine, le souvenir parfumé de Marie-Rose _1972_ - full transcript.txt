Les Films de Jean-Noël Delamarre present ALBERTINE, OR THE FRAGRANT MEMORY OF MARIE-ROSE A film by the Eugène Varlin Group Do you know that? Could you say now what that is? How would you do that? If you were the girl who did that, the one I told you about earlier. It was this girl. She started by standing alone in the playground She was always alone. I was a bit aggressive because I don't like seeing girls alone I went to see her and said, “What's the matter? I don't know you” but I'd like to know you.” She told me, “I'm in serious trouble” And I asked, “What kind?” And she said, “I slept with a boy and I think I'm pregnant.” “My mother is in jail, my dad drinks, my younger sister is pregnant, we don't have any money.” The church welcomes you today, you and your families, with great joy, like a mother welcomes her children. Oh no, but papa! The children's faults, are faults that God gives you. In a few moments, they will go back home, back to the paternal home, the family home. Look out for them, look out for their purity. These faults as we said are imposed by God. When our children, when your children are sick, suffer from the smallest pain, you're automatically worried, it's normal. But above, beyond the life of the body there is also the health of our children's souls, and that's why we must watch over them. It's our responsibility, to watch over their conduct. A lot of things could be said on this subject. Look after their appearances, the movies they watch, their readings, their relationships, whatever else. We don't want kids, we don't know them. We want the right to make love without having children. We want the right to make love without getting married. So, you're looking to know how to kill your kid? Don't talk to him, look how high up he is, he's an angel. Madame, angels have no sex. You must not have one either. - She's funny. - I'm not funny, see, I'm getting some applause. It's not because you're getting applause that you're right- The women can defend themselves. Men will never defend women, never. Women should defend their purity. Let's cover our ears. If that's a man, what kind of a husband will he make. Four thousand – is it a lot or not enough? It's huge, their high schools are empty now. They can't find work at 14, they're too young. They end up in foster homes, which are real prisons. They can't go out, and are being hidden. Why are they being hidden? We should rather communicate on the matter, instead of hiding them. Parents are behind in France. We have maintained the French people in a state of foolishness. You have to pay, these pleasures are pornographic. - I'm not against the pleasures. - Enjoy, enjoy. Enjoy it as much as you want, you'll die of happiness. I was pregnant at 16, at 19, I had two kids and my husband abandoned me. I will stand up for this issue, loud and clear. Often, the first child arrives before the wedding. But, with the birth, a lot of things change. Not necessarily the length of the hair, nor the styles of clothing, but the pace of living. Henceforth, the random coupling of individuals is replaced by the law of the couple, based around the child, which dictates the rules of domestic life. I've only wanted that, out of all the tools at our disposal to give back a soul to our society and ensure its survival, The family would be the most accessible, the strongest, the most efficient. The family is best placed to resist shocks, as it is founded on nature, on the law of the species. It carries with it the certitudes of its origin, along with the promise of its perpetuation. Speaking of maternal love, Victor Hugo wrote: “Everyone has his part, and all have it all.” A bite for daddy! A bite for mommy! The little cutie!
