[muttering, laughter] [talking in unison] Just a second. One moment, please. Just a little... Beautiful , oh. Ah... [Adrien] Hold it! Who found him? I did. - Who else? - [Barrett] Steven, don't speak to your mother that way. [shutter sound] Ah, thank you very much. Thank you. I'm sorry, Mr. Adrien. My husband knows a great deal about ranching, but not very much about art. [chuckle] Now, let me point out some of the people I want you to photograph for the album. Over there is Barrett's cousin, Carson Fears. [Adrien] Yes, Ma'am. - [shutter noise] - [Marla] Father of the groom. And, uh, the groom. [Marla] Bobby, Carlson, son. [shutter sound] And, let's not forget the bride. Reva, a local belle. Much pursued and, almost always caught on my head. [shutter sound] And, over there, the maid of honor. [Marla] Karen Fears, Bobby's sister. [shutter sound] And the gentleman with her? Oh, that's our foreman. Oscar Callahoughney. Needs a whole story in itself. [shutter sound] And wasn't there another son? Barrett's son, Mitch. He's not here. Didn't I read something about him in the paper? Oh, I'm sure. Mitch was always good for news. Ever heard about him? Ballroom brawls, breaches of promises. He takes after the wild side of the family, I'm afraid. Mitch left five years ago and we're not expecting him. [Barrett] Marla, would you come here, please? Oh, yes, just a minute. Thank you very much. Excuse me. Thank you. [shutter sound] Probably never got the letter. Mitch never did stay in one place too long. Why wouldn't him come home? You know why. [inaudible muttering] [Reva] I wonder where he is now. - Mitch, I don't know. - About what? Well, I've been thinking. Don't. You know damn good it. Well, when you start ripping off guys - like those guys-- - Blaine, the time those guys ripped you off. - [Blaine] Uh, well, ain't it? - Well? Ok, when Candy comes down, I call a room. - That's all? That's it? - [Mitch] That's all. Just get me out of there. I hope they find my act. Already bought it. Tonight, we get paid! [laughter] [Mitch] Woo-hoo! Vegas, here we go! [laughter, indistinct talk] - Is it alright? - [speaks in Hawaiian] Daddy! Mama! Let's go listen to Bobby play. You run along, we'll be there. Ok. A one, a two, a one, two, three, four. [live music] Boss. Mr. Carson. [Barrett] Well, we can always hope. Once Bobby has a family of his own, maybe he'll begin to take more interest in things around here. Fine, he can have my job. I gave him 6 acres for a wedding dress. - Bobby told you? - No. might like to build up by the old homestead. You worked that out with him. That's very generous of you, Barrett. I hope they thank you. What is it? I don't know. - Help me sit down. - Woah! Help me! You better come quick. It's Mr. Barrett. Excuse me. - What is it, dad? - He got a stroke. Oh, my God. Barry! - What - Uhh. Alright! [grunts] [babbling] [speaks in Hawaiian] [muttering] Anyway, move aside. Stephen, button your coat. Go and make sure the guests keep the party going. You know what to say. I do? You better get used to it. You might be in charge here by tomorrow. I'll be with Barrett. Listen, we gotta find Mitch now. - Ok. - What made you think I stopped looking, huh? Call. Call. [groans] See, ya, it's getting kinda hot in here. Can we get the cocktail waitress up again? Give me the bar. Dave? Barrio for a week. [barman] Candy! More rum for your buddy. We go. - Trouble calling? - It's a mistake. Let's do it more time. don't cross me six. Imagining is enough. And I'm going to have a scotch with soda. I'll take a bourbon and branch water. Tall. Oh, I'm sorry. You said "tall," didn't you? Yeah, tall. Thank you. [Mitch] Me too. Call. Call. Man, it's getting rough! Call. [sighs] Well, I guess that's me, huh? Hey. Why don't you get yourself an eraser? Scotch and soda, Tom Collins, bourbon and [phone rings] Yeah? This is the Las Vegas Police Department. Ok. One of you cowboys belong to a cattle transport? [man] The vehicle license is 765-42? That's me. Las Vegas Police must have pawned your rig. You're traveling with last year's plates. [sighs, chuckles] Sorry, guys, gotta leave. Another time, huh? 12,000+. Space 20. Seventeen... Eighteen... Nineteen... And... [man] Hey, hold up there! How do you get this damn thing started? [engine starts] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] Hello. - [Roy] Mr. Callahoughney. - Yeah. This is Roy Waters. [Roy] Of the agency. I found him. - Yeah. - Roy Waters. - Room? - Up ahead. There he is. When did he get here? He left Las Vegas... 4:00 in the afternoon. By Beverly Hills last night. - Thanks. - Sure. We just bought three boats from these people. They did pretty with the sexism. Nothing like you, then, huh? Remember? I'm the good-looking one. [Mitch] You! You bonehead! How you doing, man? Good, good. - I'm married now. - You? - Wait a minute, let me guess. - Her name's Reva. Oh, she's a girl from Mahina, I think you know her. Why, you got a picture? - Ain't she cute? - Yeah. The old's one. She's... She's a foreigner. Unbelievable. - Just unbelievable! - Yeah. Bobby and Reva, they're married. Bobby, huh? Yes. It's been a week, though. Ain't too late. The kahuna, he still has to make it official. [exhales] How about that? Poet comes through. Bobby's straight, now. Reva's got him writing music again. Is that why did you find me? Wha... Hardened detective. [laughs] Things ain't too good at home, Mitch. Your old man, he's had a stroke. Just hanging on by a thread. What do you want me to do? He's your father! He might not make it! It's not gonna happen, Oscar. I don't like him any more than he likes me. It ain't him, it's her! [Candy] Hey, Mitch! Come on in! Hey. Can't we go somewhere while we talk? In your room or something? Yeah, I got some business. Be back in a while. Ok. If your old man dies, half the ranch is yours. Then have Stephen and the Dragon Ladies. What more are you waiting for? She's already selling the White Kailua Beach, Stephen is the executive director. Nobody knows what the hell they're doing. Imagine that. Sweet girl like that-- Now, wait a minute. Don't you complain. You handed Marla her power on a silver platter when you bailed out. I'm not complaining. You are. [snorts] [Mitch] Yeah, yeah, - Yeah. - How much this place sets you back? Plenty. And it was rough. Toilet's stopped up. See, now, if you're back home-- If I was back home, I'd have to go outside. That's true. [chuckles] What will you have? I'll have about $12,000. You didn't think you'd get away with that, did you? Ok, pal, take a walk. [Lou] The cowboy and me got some private business to discuss. What's this? It's Lou Barrio. Does odd jobs for some people in Vegas. Mr. Barrio, my friend and I here gonna have a drink, and I don't reckon inviting you. Take it easy, pal, or somebody is gonna get hurt. Uh, tequila lime, was it? [Lou] Hey, I'm talking to you! [gunshot] [panting] Let's get him in the bedroom. Hold it right! You better rough up, cowboy, 'cause I'm gonna get you. Wait. [Oscar] Let's get outta here! [Candy] Mitch, where are you going? I'll go back to the room. Go home, I'll call you in a couple of days. Come on! - I forgot something! - Yeah, your pants. No, my hat! Airport International. We gotta get the noon plane at Honolulu. - Honolulu? - Well, where else you gonna go, dressed like that? Hey, honey, will you hit me and my friend again when you get the chance? He, uh, collects the little bottles. So enough about Nevada. How's your mom? She's great. Never changes. Thank god. If this Maiwea deal goes through, - you lose a house, huh? - Sure. All the Paniolo family would be down on the street. Who's the buyer? I don't know. Somebody called the Crestfield Corporation. Nobody knows who they are. Sure got a lot of money to throw around, though. Sweet Marla. [Oscar] She speaks highly of you, too. [exhales] So... Dad's not doing too good, huh? Nobody knows. Marla's got him locked out in a room in some dude's garden day and night. That figures. Karen's gonna meet us at the airport. [Oscar] Nobody else knows you're coming. Kiki? - How's she doing? - She's fine. She's the best one in the family. Well, there is a problem... Hmm? [Oscar] That she thinks you're terrific. Hey! It's because she's got class. Big shot, huh? You think you can buy Maiwea? You gotta get Big Lulu out first! Who's the fat woman? Oh, that's just Big Lulu. She's the foreman's mother. [Stephen] She found Oscar in a basket of laundry one day when he was about a day old. After she washed him, she decided to keep him. She gonna give us trouble? I don't think so. She's been with the ranch forever in one capacity or another. [Marla] My husband She took care of him when he had a stroke, but, I've dismissed her since then. We'd prefer to leave the matter of relocating these people to you. Was the understanding that we would step in under certain circumstances. if that became necessary. Most of these people have lived here a long time. Several generations, in some cases. Sometimes they forget the houses belong to the ranch. I guess we'll just have to remind them. Ok, let's go to the beach. [Mitch] What time you got? Five to ten. Don't worry. The connecting flight to the big island isn't until 11:00. What about the connecting flight? I just wanna know where the drinks are. Reva and Bobby, huh? I can see that working out. - Reva is a big girl. - Tell me. She knows what she's doing. It's Bobby. Hey, look there, the big island. Here we go. [stewardess] $3, please. I, you'll have to get it again, Oscar. I left my pants at Beverly Hills. Very nice. One of the most beautiful beaches in the world. You know, there's a story. The generations of Hawaiian kings use to come here on their wedding nights. [Carson] The locals regarded it as a ground consecrated to love. You seem to know a lot about these things. - I read. - And, with a new airport and hotel facilities in Hilo, the rest of the world is only minutes away. I still say, be nice to know who are us supposed to be selling this to. I told you, Stephen. The principals preferred to remain anonymous as a matter of policy. The prospects have a list of the board of directors if you'd like to see that. Thank you. [man] We'll be in a bit back. I have a check here for 2 and a half million dollars. Stephen. [P.A.] Hawaiian Air has arrived. Number 27 from Los Angeles arriving at gate 4. There he is! [shouting] Oh, sure is. Hi there! [Karen] I can't believe you're here! Aha, I didn't take a long plane ride for nothing! [grunts] When did you grow up to be so pretty, huh? You're a liar. I only gained six pounds since I was 11-years old and that wasn't one pound a year. Sure looks good to me. [Mitch] Mr. Garfield! [laughs] Hey! - Are you ready? - Aye! How come the long face, huh? [laughter] Hey, we better hurry, ok? Because there's Crestfield people in here. - What's the rush? - Well, you'll know once you look at the beach, and they're probably backed up by this time. Oh, let's go! Come on, come on! Hey, Garfield, they give you back your license yet? Not yet, brother. [laughter] [Marla] Mr. Fenton, Mr. Hubbard. Alvin Weather. How you doing? Alvin is the family lawyer, and, distinguished member of our estate assembly. Of course. We've been corresponding. How's the ability to legalize gambling coming along? We're beginning to garner local support. Good. As you know, the gaming aspect is a vital part of our operation. Now, I have a letter of agreement here to serve the attorney's drawing up the contract. And, here, a bank check for the first installment as agreed. 2.5 millions, half of the purchase price. Have you seen this, Carson? Looks fine to me. You go along with this very easily, Carson. Why not? That ranch is your home too. My father withdrew all these people up to his propriety if it were himself. This isn't my ranch, Stephen. My father sold his half to your grandfather. I only work here. Don't object because he knows the congress in White Kailua beach? This ranch isn't an acronym, Stephen. Real estate's interests have been after us for years. [Carson] And there comes a point when land development is more lucrative than raising cattle. We've reached that point. [Alvin] That seems in order. If the principal was kept aside. Stephen, my darling. [exhales] How nice to be a principal. One needs only sign one's name to acquire instant status. Stephen, will you sign the paper, please? I don't believe it. What are you doing here? I live here, remember? Hello, everybody. Quite the family gathering. All we need is a Christmas tree. Who's this? He's my stepson, Mitch. [Marla] Mitch is the family's traveller. Yeah, all true. There's no place like home, huh? The house is in the same place. dinner would be served at 7:00. Now, if you'll excuse us, we have some business to conduct here. Oh, yeah? Who's that? Hey, 5 million dollars. [Mitch] It's quite a hunk of money, huh? Part of it is yours, of course. How you doing, Alvin? [Mitch] My father knows about this? Mitch, your father is very sick. This thing ain't worth the paper is written on, until he's dead. Mitch, your stepmother has empowered the attorney. - [Mitch] By whom? - [Alvin] By your father. Oh, yeah? Try again, man. Perhaps I've come in a bad time. Why don't you folks take a day to work things out? Meanwhile, Crestfield Corporation regards the sale as final. [Fenton] Believe our check with you is evidence of our good faith. We'll make some time next week. Maybe you guys have a in your head. The propriety is not for sale. [Marla] I'm very sorry, uh, we had no idea. [Carson] He has a tendency to make troubles. Welcome home. Where are you going? Hi? Mitch, your father is very sick and very weak. Why ain't he in the hospital? He was. Now there's nothing more they can do for him. He's dying, Mitch. Quite upsetting. I'm upsetting. Just want to talk to him. Am I supposed to believe your sudden burst of filial devotion after five years of silence? I don't give a damn what you believe. If you wanted to help your father, the time to have done it was five years ago. He begged you to stay! It's the only time I've ever seen Barret Fears beg for anything in his life! And you spit in his face. I didn't spit in his face. I told him to go to hell. You're just the same, aren't you? [Marla] You don't care about anything! You don't care about this ranch or what goes on here! You're right about that. At least since my mother died. I am married to your father. Your father adopted Stephen. [Marla] If you can't live with that, I suggest you go right back where you came from. I will. Just as soon as I finish what I came here to do. It'll take the rest of your life. And it'll break you, Mitch. You're not fighting me or Stephen. You're fighting progress. This place is a dream! But it's over. Yeah. Well... What are you so worried about? I'm not worried. I'm just... Inconvenienced. Ain't worth it. Mitch. Reva is married now, you know. Uh-huh. So everybody tells me. Hey! Hey, you can't come in here! Here to see my father. - Oh, so you're the son. - Yeah, that's right. Well, you still can't come in here. He looks dead! You're supposed to take care of him! Don't get [grunt] [grunt] [grunts] Got you, you little creep! [grunts] [scream] [grunt] [grunts] [grunt] [exhales] Come on, come on, get up. Come on. You! What have you done? [exhales] You never gonna learn, are you? You ok? Uh-huh, yeah. Hey, man, can we... Can we get your mother over here? They've just letting him die over here. That's a lie! Dr. Turner has been here every day! Never mind. I'll just take him to my house. I'll go get Garfield. You ok? Oh, yeah. Come here. My poor darling. What have they done? I wouldn't listen to Mitch this time, Oscar! If my husband dies in your home, I'll see that you're charged with murder! Yes, ma'am. [Mitch] Let's turn him around, huh? Gotta get him in the back Let's give it another go! Watch it. - Easy, there. - [exhales] - I'll follow you in the jeep. - Alright. Hello, Mitch. How you doing, Reva? Have you seen Bobby? [Mitch] Not yet. [laughter] They had a good at the big house. Why, you guys! [laughter] [laughter, speaking in unison] Again! - Kiki! Kiki! - Again, again! Kikikikikiki! I can't stop! [panting] I thought you'd never call me Karen again. Hey, what's the problem? You know you'll always be my Kiki. Don't you, Karen? [shouting] [Karen] Gosh! I'll get you! [laughter] Hold on! I'm fine. Hey, who wants , huh? - Come on, kids. - Over there. Come on! [giggles] Some kind of woman you got there, partner. She's got a sister. A married sister! [Oscar] Well, that never stopped him before. Why do you think I'm in trouble all the time? Hey, save some for me! [Oscar] Yeah! [Lulu] Mitch? Hey, mom. How's it doing? - He wants to see you. - You got him awake? - Yeah! - Good doing, Lu! You know me, I've got the magic. One milk and gin. You sure do. He's pretty weak, Mitch. Just a couple of minutes, huh? You bet. Pa? [mumble] Son. How you doing? Oh... I had a stroke. Left side's all gone dead. You know what they say. What? Two sides to everything. [chuckles] Oscar said things are gonna rough around here. Thought I'd might be of some help. Could have been some help five years ago. I couldn't stay here on your terms. My terms are still the same. She is your stepmother and my wife. And you will respect her as such. [mutters] So, stepmother, this wife of yours... You'd be dead right now if I hadn't brought you here. Mitch, you have no right to do... That was an insult to me, Mitch. And to the woman I'm married. I'll be going back in the morning. She gave moral power to an attorney. Did she say I did? Yup. Then I did. You know she's using it to sell Maiwea? Like Kailua beach? Huh? This house is right on the middle of the package. This house where you are right now! Damnit, you promised Big Lulu she could live here till the day she died! Did we get a good price for it? What are you telling me? It's ok? I'm telling you, Mitch, it's all a little late. That you have no voice in the matter. Ok... That's the way you want it? I'll do it alone. Hey, Mitch. You can stay here, eh? [sighs] I'll take the room over the stable. Is that a... A detective, you hired to find me. - Huh? - It's any good? Nobody else could find you. [chuckles] Give him a call, will ya? Gotta find who's behind Crestfield Corporation, - Sure. - Thanks, bro. Hey. Take care, huh? ♪ You showed me the morning ♪ ♪ And gave me today ♪ ♪ I live by your body ♪ ♪ And started to pray ♪ ♪ Don't leave me, My darling♪ ♪ Be mine ♪ Bobby! That's beautiful! - Yeah. You like it? - Uh-huh. [laughs] Well, I did it all in 20 minutes and I did it all for you. I love you! Bobby. What's the matter? I told you. I promised my parents I'd come home tonight. I know if we keep this up, I may not make it. That's the general idea. I would marry you, remember? [laughs] Please, honey, don't make it harder than it is. You know my father is the kahuna, and he wants to bless us. But it doesn't make any sense. I mean, just last month, we thought you were pregnant. - For crying out loud. - I know. But it does to my parents. And to me too, I guess. Somewhere... In Hawaiian park. And that's the only reason. What? Your folks. I mean, that's the only reason? [sighs] I'm not blind, Reva! I saw you with Mitch today. I said hello to him, Bobby. I can't just pretend he's not here. Yeah... I'm sorry. I love you. Hey, you know that song I just played for you? Well, it's only the first one. There's gonna be a whole cycle. And I gonna score for the band and a full symphony orchestra. That's all for you, Reva. It's about you and me. I got it all laid out in my head. Oh, Bobby. It's beautiful. Thank you. But you've got me, ok? Ok. I love you. [mooing] Hey, let's take this one - and put him on a circle, huh? - Alright. [shouts] Leave it! Leave it down! [Karen] Leave him down. There he is! [laughs] [laughter] When are you gonna give this kid a job? I want to find a place for her in the bunkhouse. [laughter] Now that's a pretty fair piece of work for a little squirt, why, ain't it? You, big... I'll take you down any day! Oh, yeah? Hey... You got a fella hanging around these days, Kiki? What kind of a question is that? I don't know. Just a question. Why is everybody so concerned about whether I have a boyfriend or not? Didn't know they were. Mister, look at me. I mean, I look like a boy. - Because you wanna. - Mitch, I got no chest. Hey, that's just an excuse, you know? An excuse for what? Just cause you've got a kid's nickname it don't make you a kid. You're 18-years old now and you're a girl. Well, you love me, don't you? - You bet I do. - That's all I care about. Oh, yeah? Pull it up, little bean. Sorry, but I got nothing to say about it! [Marla] Oh, here he is. Now we can get started. Sorry I'm late. Believe it or not, I've been up on the phone all morning with Barrett. Well, that's impossible. Apparently, Mitch was talking to him last night. It's a check for 2 and a half million dollars to cover the down payment. The deal's off. [Fenton] No, the deal's not off, Mr. Walter. This transaction was conducted in good faith under an instrument of an empowered attorney. He's rescinded it. But it can't be! Oh, yes, it can, Marla! Just Are you tell me this whole segment is Well, I'm telling you it's not. But it's necessary we get the doctor's certificate this night. Now, shall we proceed? Under the circumstances where we might consider bringing in some of our own people to assist in the orderly transition of the propriety. And just what kind of people would that be? I wouldn't concern myself with that, Mr. Fears. [Hubbard] You'll probably never even see them. - Where is he? - In the music room. We haven't done anything like this in more than a year! Mitch! Mitch. Anything else? He called the house last night and found out I didn't come home. One of the kids answered the phone. Mitch. Why did you have to come back? Go up there and tell him you're leaving. Bobby? It's Mitch. Let me in, I gotta talk to you. Anybody talk to him? No. He just... [speaks in Hawaiian] Everything will be alright. You can go now. Hey, Bobby? I'll kick the door down, it's all the same to me. [Bobby] Only you, Mitch. Nobody else, ok? - Yeah. - [unlocking sounds] [sighs] What's going on, man? I didn't take them. I was kinda worried for a while, there. I was gonna take them. - But I didn't. - Ok. [sighs] - You want to tell me about it? - [exhales] You already know all about it. Bobby, it's not the last-- Hey, you don't have to say anything to me! I know how Reva feels about you! I've always known. Just like everybody else! It's just that... It's just that you were gone for so long that I conned myself into forgetting it. Hey. Bobby... She loves you, man. She really loves you. She loves a lot of people. I just happen to be one of them. But she belongs to you. What you're trying to say? I've been sitting here since 4:00 this morning. Really out of my tree, you know? And, finally, I said to myself: "Hey, Robert, what's happening, man? What's going down?" You can do all kinds of crazy things you want to do, and it's not gonna change the way things are. The way things are. It's Mitch and Reva." It's always been Mitch and Reva! So that's it! Mitch and Reva! [Mitch] Wait a minute. What are you...? You giving up to me, is that it? I'm setting her free. [laughs] Don't tell me, man. Tell her! Hey, come on. Get your clothes. Let's go. Go where? [Mitch] I dunno. How's downtown Hilos? Heard they opened a new bar, the Waiakea. What for? You really want her, don't you? Don't you? I'm sure I want her. But... [muttering] Lop off your knees before they catch up to the ankles. You really love her. You gotta lay down the line. You say: "Hey, woman, you belong to me." I can't say that, Mitch. Doesn't sound like me. There's more than one way to skin a cat. Put your shirt on. All in love Hey, come on! She'll be here when you get back. When you get out there, stay cool. You know what I mean? Stay cool. He's fine, Reva. Bobby. Where are you going? To Hilo. Mitch and I have some business there. Are you sure you're alright? Yeah, I'm fine. I'll bring you something. Bobby. I love you. [laughter] Carson's just not strong enough to get the people to move out. Well, I think you have to proceed with your plans to convince the plenty of all those families to vacate Maiwea. [chuckles] Alright. I'll just leave it in your hands. Bye. Barret, my darling! You're looking so much better! How good that you came home. You got the check? I'm afraid they tore it up. Good. [mumbles] Two and a half million dollars richer. I don't think it's gonna be that easy. I have to be honest with you, Barrett. These people have mafia connections, and so forth. There may be some trouble. I'm not unaccustomed to trouble. I just can't get over how you've improved. Yes. What a shame I had to be moved out of my own home to achieve it. There's some ugly rumors about that was perhaps not receiving all the care here that I should have. Well, that's ridiculous! You know that's ridiculous. Where's Ross? I've fired him. Oh. I assumed he impressed you with the competency he did not possess I'm sure that if you had personally been in charge of my care, none of these rumors could have gotten started. [exhales] Of course, darling, that goes without saying. Good. I'm glad you said that. I had Garfield install a buzzing system between our rooms, so we could communicate directly with one another. Should be quite of a step saver for you. My goodness. [loud buzz] How professional. What are you doing in my room? Waiting for you. I thought Barrett fired you. I don't work for him. Well, now I'm firing you. Get out. How come? - How come? - [Ross] Uh-huh. I told you that no one was going to have access to Barrett's room except Dr. Turner and myself. No one! All you had to do is sit in a room with a very sick man and keep people out. If you had done what I told you, none of this would be happening now! That guy Mitch came busting in there. What could I do? Your job, Charlie. Your job! Now get out! No, wait just a minute, you can't get rid of me that easily! Oh. Of course not. Would that take care of it? And go to the apartment and I'll call you. I may not be there. You'll be there. [buzzer] [fire sirens] Go! Go! Go! Come on, hurry up! Hurry up. Get out of here! Get over there! Come on, go. [shouting] Come on! [shouting] Get over there! Don't worry. I just right now around the agency. Wait! Steve! Where are you going? I'm a volunteer, remember? [Marla] Don't be ridiculous. What? I said, don't be ridiculous. There's nothing you can do. Stephen, I want you with me. Besides, If you go, then you missed the point. [Oscar] Hey, Mitch. They weren't trying to hide anything, were they? Looks like the Crestfield Corporation is trying to tell us something. I guess so, buddy. Guess I'm just a louse in this Ok, Nicky's going to be in charge of the building materials. You can order whatever you want from Manny's and charge it to the ranch. [Mitch] Everybody puts in a couple hours a day pounding nails, huh? When we're together we can get Maiwea rebuilt before branding's over, eh? Didn't know you smoked. Remember that damn buzzer around here? You got to tell me about the buzzer. He's winning, you know? Your father. After all that buzz and alarm, that sick old man is the winner. Some people tell me he was dying. Don't believe it. He's in his glory. And why wouldn't he be? Everything is going his way. He's got us both working for him. I'm keeping him alive, and you're protecting Maiwea for him. I'm not doing it for him. Oh, he knows that. You know what he did today? He told Carson to cut out any further funds from Maiwea. Can't do that. We've only had finished. You have a trust fund, right? From your mother? I've never touched it. Well, you will now. Right? If there's no more money from any other source, it's so your father gets Maiwea rebuilt to have a price. Not a bad bargain, for a sick old man. No. Yeah, well, so what else is new? You still don't see it, do you? He wants us against each other! He wants us to cross purposes! He's told me he wanst us to work together. What your father wants, is what he's always wanted. He wants you to take over the ranch when he's gone. Oh, he hates you. He hates you for your attitude towards me. He hates you for not finishing Kunahau. For not going to college. For being a bomb and drifter. But he knows you're the only one who can run the ranch the way he wants it run. And he also knows the only way to keep you is to keep up the threat on the Paniolo families. And that's my job. And Stephen's. And when it suits his purpose, he helps us. And when it doesn't, he helps you. Why do you think he adopted Stephen? Put that much potential power into the hands of someone so clearly incapable of running this ranch? To get you back. So? He's using you, Mitch. Just like he's using all of us. But at least you have a chance to get away before it's too late. You really want to get rid of me in the worst way, don't you? There is another alternative. We could work together. I mean, really work together. And become very, very rich. You and I don't want the same things, Marla. But that's why we make a good team. Meaning we each take care of our own area of interest. You see the ranch is kept running properly, until it was phased out. You could see that the Paniolos were properly transferred and recompensed. Just as well be you as anybody else. Alone, you can't win. But, with me, you could have everything. There's a bottle of bourbon at the cabinet. Why don't you pop yourself a drink on the way out. You're making a big mistake, Mitch. [telephone rings] [telephone rings] Hello? Candy, baby! How are you? What? It's an old friend. She'll understand. It's time you make some new friends, Mitch. Now, what's going on? - [Mitch] Where are you? - I'm in Vegas. Please, Mitch, can you come back? - [Candy] Please. - What's the problem? Fears? A friend of Lou Barrio's. [Roy] You remember Lou? It seems you owe him some money. Well, I want that money here tomorrow afternoon, Or your waitress is not going to have any arms to Come on, you can just tell me what I need to bring and I'll be there. [buzzer] ! , see what Mr. Barrett wants! [panting] [angry laughter] [shout] [angry laughter] [sobbing] [knocking on the door] Mother? Yes? [Stephen] You alright? Yes. What's the matter? It's alright, really. Is there anything I can do? [sad chuckle] What? You don't know what it's like to be alone. You've always had me. I can't help you if you don't tell me what it is. That's just what I mean. Oh, for God's sake. Then I shouldn't have to tell you! That's just what I mean! I have to do it all! Even the explaining! Oh my God! I get so tired of... [babbling] I don't think I can get through another day. Mother. What the hell do you want? Stephen, I have been doing it completely alone! Carson is spineless! There's only one man on this propriety and he is the one I'm fighting. Just say what is it that I'm supposed to do. Oh, Stephen. Be a little strong. For me? Take some initiative. Give me some help. How do I do that, mom? I wasn't raised to be strong. I haven't had any practice. Everything is my fault! Well, I doubt the self-pity is going to improve the situation much, Marla. Oh, stop calling me Marla! That's not strong, it's just bitchy! Well, it's basic, Mar... Mother. Most of the time, the way I am suits you just fine. I mean, I'm clever and I'm presentable. Particularly in company, that's when I shine. "Little boy blue, come blow your horn. The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn." See? I still remember. "Oh, Marla, he's just a love! Where did you get that cute little suit?" Aren't you satisfied with the way you are, Stephen? Most of the time. There's an occasional backlash. I cry sometimes too. Well, I doubt the self-pity will improve the situation much. If I change, you'd hate me. Will you go to Mitch. Talk to him for me. About what? Just let him know that we're together. That he has to fight two instead of one, now He's gonna laugh. No, he won't. He'll respect you for it. [sighs] I love you, Stephen. Alright. [exhales] [Oscar] With the time should be there this afternoon. [Mitch] Just hope that nothing delays the plane, that's all. [Oscar] When will you be back? [Mitch] I don't know. Couple of days. I'll let you know. [Oscar] Mitch! Couple of days, right? Yeah, yeah, couple of days! Candy? Candy. Candy? Honey? [priest] And to your hands, oh Lord, we commend her spirit. Trusting in thy everlasting mercy. Amen. What are we going to do now? Nail Barrio. What can you do, man? Just wait and see what the cops come up with. I've got a pretty good idea of what they'll come up with. Why did they kill her, man? I had the money. I was on time. What else was there? Maybe they didn't want the money. I'm Roy Waters. I'm with the agency. Maybe they wanted something else. Like what? What happened? I got on a plane and I flew over here. That's all. Maybe that's all they wanted. To get you over here and away from there. Lou Barrio and a couple of his buddies took off to the island yesterday. Maybe that's the connection. Connection... Yeah, I can see this connection. I fell right into it. Well, what else can you do? There's something else you might be interested in. You know, Oscar called me. So I've been running down the principals of the Crestfield Corporation. Mostly names of who to expect. Probably business figures. A lot of them with interest here in Vegas. Most with underworld connections either proved or unproved. There is another name, however. Here. [Roy] Carson Fears. He a relative of yours? - [Mitch] Where's Carson now? - At his office, I think. I'll take you there. Carson! Without come inside - What-- - Where's Barrio? ...The ceiling. What's the matter? Barrio! Where is he? Who's Barrio? The killer you and your friends hired! I knew him in Vegas. Oh, dear. Oh! Now, where is he? Look, I never wanted to go this far. All I ever wanted was a piece of what was rightfully mine. The hell are you talking about? My father was always good to you! Good to me? I don't want charity! I want what is mine and my children's! It's all perfectly legal. Everything we did was opened about, boy. As far as I know, murder has never been legal. No, no, we worked it all out! I insisted the only shooting was to be at the cattle. Cattle? Which cattle? [whistling] Karen, you take the jeep! Round about all the Paniolos you can find and stay away from Kailua beach! Tell him to bring the guns! Oscar's in trouble! Can't come through here, cowboy. This is private propriety. That's right. You're trespassing. You better get those cows outta here or you're gonna have a lot of hamburger in your hands. Listen, you gotta get these men out of here, huh? Cause that herd is gonna trample. [gunshot] [neighing] [shouts] Yeah! Yeah, . Look out! [shouting] [gunshot] [gunfire] Boys! Come on! [gunfire] [yelling] [shouting] [cowboy] Sit down there. [cocks rifle] I'm won't blow your head off. But I hope that you bleed to death before the cops get you back to Vegas. [honking] What are you doing? Call Montana. I got an opening for a supervisor at the Bar 7. There's nothing for you in Montana. I never said I was gonna stay, Oscar. Come on, this is your place, you belong here. I dunno what to tell you, man. Why do ya? I don't know! Must be because I like it. - Or something. - Hey, you were worried about Maiwea and White Kailua beach. Stopped them cold. For now. You leave, and Marla is back in the saddle. The old man is getting better. He's gonna make it. There's nothing for me to do except hang around and get frustrated. The old man's running the show, I'm just another cowboy. [chuckles] Worse. I'm family, so I don't get paid. At least in Montana I can do my job, get paid what I'm worth. I can look at myself in the mirror when I wake up every morning. But the old man... Either all his way, or... Nothing. Need a ride to the airport? Hey. First one to see the kids gets [tribal singing] [shouting in Hawaiian] - Good luck, you guys. - Thanks, Mitch. [shouts] You know I don't want you to go. It's better this way, honey. All that nonsense I left behind five years ago, is still here. But what about me? I'm still here. Why did you think I stayed here so long? We'll get you served some , brother. Well, pa'. Guess I'll be saying goodbye. The Air Force wants to buy 7,000 acres and Hilo for a long-range bomber base. How you feel about that? Not a difference. I'm leaving. Mitch. You've done a fine job here. You're good. Too good to be somebody's hired hand all your life. I ain't gonna be a hired hand. I'm gonna be running the ranch. You won't get out of the airport. What? Police are waiting there to arrest you in the event you persist trying to leave. Judge Colbert called last evening out of courtesy. He signed a warrant. You'll say I didn't do anything, won't you? Mitch, you killed a man. The driver for Crestfield Corporation. Now, I had persuaded the judge to release you under my custody until the hearing. You won't be able to leave the island, of course. But, other than that, you're free. Well, never was one to miss a good party. [cheering] Hey, Mitch! Your lover! Big Lulu just wanna squeeze your sweet body! [shouts] [cheering]
