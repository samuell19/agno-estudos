APRIL 23, 1994 YALOVA I wish children would rule the world. I give up my office for one day to children who are our future. For today, our District Governor will be Ferhat and his assistant will be Gokhan. And the world becomes a better place for one day. Move, move. Handsome, go get me a cup of tea. Right away, Mr. District Governor. Where is the tea maker? Since I have the office now, you can take your leave, Mr. District Governor. I'm in control now. Thank you for your service. Security, do your job. Are we going to wait for him to leave all day? He's sitting right there. What is going on? As you can see, people, we just literally took over a chaos. I'm saying this to those who are tenured and think they are safe. If you're not willing to work, you should better go and find a new job. I need hardworking employees more than anything else. Exactly Mr. District Governor. There are 200 people working here, but still there is not even a tea shop. If you all take turns at making tea each day, how much money would we keep in our vault? If each of them had two cups of tea each day, we would save three million liras per day. That is a nice amount of cash these days. A treasure if you know how to use it. You can take care of your family with that amount of money. Who am I talking to, though? He's giving me a blank look. What are you looking at? That is enough shooting for today. Reporters, out! Where did you find these kids? Sir, he's my boy. I think he got excited. -He's not one of us. -No, he's not. Today is our blessed day. Let’s live a happy life. APRIL 23, 1994 BURSA Today is April, 23. Our hearts are filled with joy. Look how she's reading it nicely, Muzaffer. Well done, my girl. No! She will be an engineer. We cross that bridge when we come to it. No, she will be an engineer next year. They are doing a nice job. He's wearing a free costume and props, but we had to pay a lot for her tailored costume. Stop it, for God's sake. AFTER 10 YEARS BURSA Muzaffer, it seems like you cut corners on promotional materials. It wasn’t supposed to be like this, right? What the hell? Anyway, why would we want to show off with an umbrella? We did it for advertisement, that’s it. Is this place a charity organization, wife? Her sister is like her also. If I had a bright son, I’d own my own skyscraper today. Ferhat, people are getting restless, don’t stare at them like that. Right there, we put some mirrors behind people to see their screens. They look like they are working but I'm not buying it. They play solitaire and minesweeper all day. -What is it to you? -What do you mean, dad? I don’t want to take over a ruin when I become CEO of this company. Why don’t we expand like Efe Sultan does? Kirilgan to Atilgan, over. Kirilgan to Atilgan, over. I have the security cameras facing the computer screens, and eight people are playing games, four are reading the news, and three are pretending like they are working. I noted them down. These are not workers, they are like dynamites ready to blow us out. Well, how about that? Watch out for these two boys, Zeki. They will grow so fast. Invest in these two boys, not in gold or foreign currency. AND 2018 BURSA How does this happen? It boggles my mind. There has to have an explanation. All those scientists and thinkers should say something already! It is It is a work of art. How can two mortals come together and create something like this? This is literally a divine signal. I will jinx myself, look at that beauty! Magnificent. Yes. Why am I being disturbed? Our employees do not want to work overtime, Mr. Ferhat. "Want"? What kind of word is that? Back then, you’d have to fight with a lion to make a living. Now, there are no more lions roaming around. What do you mean you don’t want to work overtime? But sir, I'm pregnant. Did I come from a tree hole, my friend? Wasn’t my mother pregnant with me? We’ve been there, but that hasn’t delayed our work ethics. -But this is so hard for us, Mr. Gokhan. -Say again? This is so hard for us, Mr. Gokhan. It is hard for me too. As the financial director of this company, it is very hard for me to pay you millions of liras every single month. When payday comes, I go home and cry. But you don’t pay overtime, Mr. Gokhan. Pardon? But you don’t pay overtime, Mr. Gokhan. Have you done anything in your life without expecting something in return, Mr. Emre? What kind of people are these, Mr. Ferhat? We have one week to submit a proposal for a high-value tender. I’ve been asking them to work overtime to get ready, as a favor. And they want overtime pay in return. When you do a favor, would you want something in return? Especially from this beauty? At Efe Sultan’s company, people are paid half of your salaries. They offer sacrifices to their gods if they get paid on time. Even water is not free in that company. As for our company... there is no water. But we allow you to bring your own water from outside. With our permission. What else should we do? We are the only company with a paid parking lot. We can’t drive to work. This is the point, my friend. We all need oxygen. Use public transports. How can everything be free? -Is this your father’s company? -No, sir. But it is my father’s. I fired my own father from his own company because of he was slacking off work! Work discipline is crucial! We need hard-working employees more than anything! My father is coming. Remember that work and family are separate things. Respect your father. Let this be an example for you. Now, get back to work. You, have those tattoos erased! This is not Detroit. Welcome, father. I wish you’ve told me you were coming. I'm shaking your hand because I don’t want to embarrass you in front of your employees. Go to your office! We need to talk. Yes, sir. Sure, I can give you five minutes. Since you're my father. Weren’t we a good role model for you, son? Why do you go and choose Goliath as a role model? Are you an imbecile, son? Won’t you let me have a peaceful retirement? -It was my time for fishing! -What happened, dad? Are these people your slaves? Today is Sunday, you fool, and everyone is here! Why don’t you give them a holiday? They don’t even want it, daddy. They don’t want to give up this peaceful work environment. Zip it, don’t lie to me! Be honest with me, since we are a bigger company now, and things are going pretty well after your retirement, are you a little bit jealous? Would Geppetto be jealous of Pinocchio? You piece of wood! Why would I be jealous of you? Father, as you know, I’ve made this company two times bigger in a year. As your mother know, I made you in the back seat of the car in four minutes. Am I bragging about this? These people have lives and families, son. Show some understanding. If necessary, take their work load and do it by yourself. A manager would even mop his own office floor if need be. With all those windows, dad? People would see me mopping the floor. I won’t embarrass myself by letting them see me cleaning my office. I never saw you clean your own office. Give me a break. You think I would be ashamed of that? Let them see, I don’t care. -Where are the bucket and the mop? -There, in the cabinet. Watch me now. That is not beneath me. Maybe this will be a lesson for you. I will be right back. Listen to me, all of you! When it comes to my work, I won't make concessions even to my own father. He begged me to hire him again. I said, no. He said, “I can’t look after your mother, I’d even mop the floors if I have to.” There! You see him with your own eyes. My old man is mopping the floor. Mr. Ferhat, what are you doing? He's your father. This was his company in the first place. And he had to work really hard! This is not a charity organization! Anyway, I'm a considerate person. After all, he's my father. I should give him another job. He can’t do it right anyway. Do I have to teach him everything? That’s not how you do it. I will do it myself. Leave it, dad. What are you doing? Get back to work! Dad, what are you doing? I understand my mistakes. I won’t do them again, I promise. Well, bravo. This is a progress, anyway. If they can’t do their jobs, I would do it for them! That’s it! Don’t make me come here again. Don’t let him be your role model. Race with yourself, not with other people. Dad, he's doing it on purpose. On the 50th floor, no one would see his billboard but me. He won’t let me forget about him. -Give me some water. I'm tired. -Sure. I know what You're thinking. There is nothing to love about this man. I'm not happy with my past either. Here you go, daddy. He has no idea what future holds for him yet. Yet. LEFTOVERS TO THOSE IN NEED Sister, have you read the news? I have. Have you read the comments below? Comments? My father put a comment below it. “Instead of thinking what to do with leftovers, think about how we could sell all of them without any leftovers so our parents wouldn’t have to work all the time.” That is nothing, here comes the killing blow. Read the rest, he wrote it nicely. “There are kids who would take Istanbul and make it a part of their empire, and there are kids who use their father’s retirement pension. I hope God wouldn’t test parents with their kids.” To be honest, I've got the best part. He paid my loans with his retirement pension last month. Anyway, I'm going to work. Mom! Dad changed his relationship status on Facebook to “complicated.” Well, he sold his car then. He was going to sell his car. Good for him. What is that? Are you talking with him in codes? He thinks it is a joke. He says he got the money. And it is only 10,000 liras. Better than nothing, though. God knows that if he had more than that, it would corrupt him. I have become used to it. It is nothing compared to other people I’ve seen in years. Hang on, here comes the baby. It’ll be over soon. Muzaffer, the baby is here. My baby. Wait a second. Give me the scissors, I will cut the cord. Doc, it is not working. Doc, we need to find a solution. I'm saying that it is not working. Didn’t you take the Hippocratic oath? It is cold here! The baby will be sick! Give me something. Well done, here we go. Applause! Damn you, Muzaffer. This is not because of poverty. Or stinginess. Maybe greed. Yes, he's greedy. Your father is a greedy man. He's insatiable. Your late grandfather knew what a prick Muzaffer was the moment he saw him. He wasn’t about to give his permission for our marriage. They barely convinced him. I have only one daughter, and I want a countryside wedding. That would be a waste, sir. A waste. Since we are in bad terms with most of our relatives, we won’t be having many guests. Let’s have a ballroom wedding. We’ve been stuck in the same topic since morning. I'm tired. Let’s flip a coin. Let fate decide for us. Okay, let’s do it. If it is tails, countryside wedding. Shame on you. Whoever took it, give it back. This is literally a robbery. What’s that got to do with it? I just found a coin in the air. Do you own the air? Do you have the title deed for it? But what is the reason for me to take the lira? What was my intention? That one lira is gone. They took it from my pocket. This is the actual robbery! You're my son. These kind of things happen between us. Mom, you're still in love with my father, though. Yes, Otherwise, it would be unbearable. Why are you running? What is it? Who am I talking to? It looks much more with all the 20 liras. I should take a picture and post it in Facebook. They will be so jealous. Those coyotes, they left me here as a bait. Mr. Gokhan! Yes, boss! Bring me that guy who opposed me. The one who said I don't pay overtime. I am dealing with the source of problem! Come with me. Move. Move! Get back to your work! Don’t eavesdrop! Do you count on your friends? Talk to my face, now! Don’t shit where you eat, right? Close the door, Gokhan! Who do you think you are? Whoever you think you are, Emre? You're more than that. You can’t even imagine how valuable you are to this company. I'm really afraid they will figure out that I'm a snitch. How would they figure it out? They are not even suspicious. You're hanging out with them after work, right? Do they call us names behind our backs? If we don't receive enough swearing, I feel like our work is incomplete. They are so creative about that. They swore at all of your relatives with no exceptions. They didn’t miss anyone. But your midwife took the lead on this. Okay, don’t praise us anymore. My ego is off the charts right now. Mr. Ferhat, can we put an end to this? -If I get caught, they will-- -No way, Emre. Even dogs don’t shit where they eat. Even dogs-- Just get closer to each other. They can see me between you two. Why would you get caught? In their eyes, you're just a miserable and useless employee who cleans my office every morning. Would snitches clean desks? We won’t get caught. Even I don’t have the keys for this room. I would clean it, though, if I was asked Get out of here! Get out, before you get yourself fired. Be thankful that we didn’t break your face. Shameless! I'm feeling good right now. Send them home after lunch. We will go home and work together. Let’s work hard to finish the proposal. So Efe Sultan... Hey there. WELCOME BOSS WE WOULD DIE FOR YOU FREE FOOD SERVICE OPEN Pull yourself together. We need to work. I'm fine now, thanks Gokhan. More coffee? What have you done? Did you eat the coffee? If we drink it, we have to go to the toilet. This is much better. Crispy. Well done, good thinking. My hands and feet are numb already. I don’t know where my mouth is. I poured down the last two cups. It was already cold. You've just lost one of your senses. You've burned yourself, didn’t you feel that, man? No. I can’t sniff it either. So I've lost two senses. Your eyes are twitching as well. It is weird, though, they are still functional. We haven’t slept like, three days. Yes, let’s keep working. There is a report for Park Street, number four. If you're close to the vicinity, pay a visit. Girl, what kind of person are you? You're off duty right now. But it is my station. What is that? Well, I'll take your car. So it was nothing. Is the proposal finished? What is the total cost? Three. At the meeting, when they ask us what our bid is for Bursa’s largest residential complex, with 800 flats, are we going to say "three"? They would hand the project to us just out of curiosity. -What the hell is three, man? -I made an error in calculation, I guess. You haven’t calculated anything yet. Three is just one number! Calculations are done by using the numbers. What is that? Why there is a cat in the house? Close the windows! We talked about this. There is no cat. It is a hallucination. It is normal. I just saw a man going to bedroom. It was so real, Gokhan. The cat looked at me, blinked and said, “What have you done for Allah today?” -Cat? -Said? You've also lost two of your senses: your eyes and ears. What are we going to do? We will join forces. You will use my eyes and ears, and I will use your skin and nose. -What was the fifth sense? -Tongue. Well, let’s not use each other’s tongues. This conversation is going to a really bad place. Here's a piece of advice. Don’t walk around the house in your underwear. Love could be at your doorstep when you less expect it. I guess it is room service. Do you have any change on you? This is a house, not a hotel. You're scaring me. Sit down. -Who is it? -The police. Get up, why are you sitting? She says, the police. The police? The police? Bro, I swear I haven’t stolen anything. Don’t give me to the cops. Fuck me. What the fuck? It wasn’t a hallucination, Ferhat. I get that. There wasn’t anyone in there when I went to the bedroom. No, bro, we looked at each other in there, you gave me a tip and left. There was a doorbell, I heard it. Didn’t you hear it? Bro, sorry for interrupting, but I haven’t heard anything. Are you sure? Are you okay, guys? What? Behind me? Behind me. You’re good. Would you also want me to open the door? Captain Elif. Weren’t you off duty? Take him. Go. Take him to the car. Don’t change his shape, he’d fit into the trunk just like this. I made sure of it. She folded him like he was an ironing board. She shrunk his body. It is not a hallucination then. You also saw what I saw, right? What? Behind me? Behind me. Yeah, I saw it. What was that? I see beyond, and it is not finished. Yes, yes, yes! Ferhat, stop. I haven’t asked yet! Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes! I didn’t believe in love at first sight. Scientifically speaking, it wouldn’t be possible otherwise. Love happens at first sight. But some of us can’t realize it until some time into the relationship. Guys, you're awake, didn't you notice the burglar? We may have noticed him. It is kind of complicated. We were working. Ferhat. Ferhat! Captain, we're sorry we opened the door in underwear. I’ve seen people without underwear. Don’t worry. Hikmet! Sorry, Captain Elif. But we saw it. Ma’am, we were working right over there, and started staring in this direction, when we heard the door. Since we have two exits... Gokhan, give that to me. Check your belongings. If anything is missing, call this number. -Have a good night. -Good night. We literally saw the burglar, but we couldn’t even say something. We are not fine. Should we sleep? No, man, I'm totally fine. Very well. What's just happened? Suddenly, the screen went dark-- I'm calling the ambulance. What is it, Gokhan? First, what happened? Second, who are you calling? Ferhat, you're scaring me. If you continue to black out like this-- I'm calling. Calling whom? Enough! Say what? Why are you playing with my well-being? I should go to that chair and black out right there. I'm covered with bruises. Go back, back, move. Left, go left. Go, move. Okay, leave it. Leave. Well done. Set the parking brake. Turn off the flashers. We should have a rear cam. It is hard to park it. Why did you send the driver home? He could’ve given me a ride. This is the company’s ambulance. And you're the CEO of the company. They shouldn’t see you in this state. It would cause rumors. Got it? Did you just black out again? What kind of hospital is this? Clean the floors! -I have a cigarette butt in my mouth. -It is your father’s hospital, quiet. Come lean on my shoulder. What am I going to do with you? Wow, was I just snoring? I woke up to it. He came around, doc. He's awake. He was sleeping really deep, He's awake now. Doctor, nothing serious, I hope? What is your diagnosis? You're just fine. It was just a faint. Just a faint? Is this a medical term? You little... No. Your body is about to expire. You smell like sewer. Your body is crying. You're not that young anymore. When was the last time you had slept seven hours straight? Last week. How can you mistreat your body like this? It is your body! If you fill your father’s hospital with your high school friends, this is how they treat you, Ferhat. Excuse me? Your father’s hospital... -It is self-criticism, Gokhan. -Sorry. Bro, this is your job. Why are you acting like this? Go to the Emergency Room then. Why did he have me brought here? This kid has an infection on his penis caused by circumcision for two days, his penis is swollen. And that is a medical term. His penis is swollen and he's in worse condition than you, but he's not complaining. My condition is that bad? Oh, cutie. No, there is nothing to be afraid of. You're totally okay. Let me check it. What the fuck! What is that? Ferhat, his penis is as large as half of him. It barely fit into the pot. They made it fit by rotating it. He's not a circumciser, He's a magician. Come. Grandpa! -His penis talked. It said "grandpa." -It was the kid who just talked. -I swear, it called me grandpa. -No, the kid called you grandpa! Why did you make him cry? Look here. Look at this toy. Wild Girl You see? This is real. I promise you, when you feel better, I will take you to ride this horse. Okay? Here, take it. Don’t believe him. He also tricks me like this. -I’ve been waiting for years to ride it. -He's just a kid. You need to see what is under that pot. Leave it alone. You made him cry again. Get out. Tell me one more time. -Get out! -I heard it right then. Not there, use the back door. That was hard work, like a sculptor’s work. My boy, why are you crying? Your mom and aunt were downstairs I went there to bring them here. We are here, don’t be scared. Muzaffer, I said I was going, why did you follow me? Oh, sweetie, did you sit here quietly waiting for your mom? Wow! Look at you, Muzaffer. carrying your grand-kid on your shoulder. What, Hikmet? Are you jealous? When the time comes, I’d carry you on my shoulder too. I wish you a peaceful death from old age. And since you're older than me... Dad, what are you doing? What am I doing? I'm joking with my friend. He's the butcher from our neighborhood. Didn’t you recognize him? I really don’t like this guy, you know? He's just cursed. He doesn’t die, never dies. Even God doesn’t take him by his side. He's that repulsive. He's my father. Why is this kid crying? What happened? Mister, it was a joke. I'm sorry. I'm a friend of Elif, Doctor Onay. You got me there. -May I? -Go ahead. How are you? I'm fine, fine. Totally fine. I'm glad my future son-in-law is a doctor. He can look after us when we get old. Dad, come on, please. it is nothing like that. We are just friends. So, it doesn’t matter. My best friend is your mother. We’ve been sharing everything for years. He's just started talking again. I will play possum. You need to be friends first anyway. It is a good thing you know each other, otherwise it would be a crime. You of all people should know since you deal with crimes. Sister, please don’t back him up. What are you doing? I'm driving. Shame on both of you. What is it to you anyway? Excuse me! Excuse me? My girl, when you marry a guy, I will call him my son. It is my business also. I have a right to vote. And he will be my brother in law, so I use my vote for the doctor. -It works for all of us. -Exactly! He would prescribe us some antibiotics. They don’t give it without a prescription, do they, dad? Go on, make fun of me. If you haven’t had a sharp wit like this... So what? What, dad? "Your husband wouldn't have divorced you and you wouldn’t stay with us with your two kids.” -Come on, Say it. -No way. Why would I say something like that? -Turn right there. -I know where our house is, dad. Did you see, pretty boy? Even you can be charmed. You shouldn’t brag about how handsome you are. There are other beauties besides you. Elif Senturk is like “Nikita.” She's not like the others, Ferhat. I was talking about that to this handsome man, Gokhan. You have no idea, she is something else. She blew my mind. What is it? How did you find it? From sources which you're not supposed to know. You're the CEO, Ferhat Atilgan. Don’t let it trouble you. Enough with this attitude, man! Ferhat, she's among the most accomplished police captains in the country. She's completed 29 out of 25 special missions with great success. Either she doesn’t know math, or this is so badass that perhaps she also handles other missions. She loves her job, like me. What else? See what you need to see. -She's an exemplary person. -Mother of my future children. She can speak French, Italian and Urdu. When we take a vacation together, she can do the talking and I can rest. Nice. You're killing me. Listen, we have worked really hard for years. We have little time left for the most important bid of our lives. Pull yourself together. Is this a right time for romance? What is this restaurant? Her father’s. It is famous for their stews. Captain Elif goes there after her shifts all the time. -Are you not coming? -Where to? -I just told you. -Told me what? We were talking about stews. And Elif might be there. We are going to ask for an address. They will definitely ask for an address, douchebags. They are just showing off. What is wrong with that car door? -Morning, sir. -Shut up! Do I look like I'm the chief? I know nothing about that address. Look, just read there. Please, don’t ask for addresses. Sir, we are from this neighborhood too. We won’t ask for an address. We are here for something else. Why are we here then? I'm Ferhat, the CEO of LSI Corporate Group. Our employees eat... in our company's cafeteria. We are here to hire your food services for our employees. Our intention is also to help out small businesses. I will be right back. Well, well, well. Look, who is here. I'm Muzaffer. It smells nice. Green soap? It's cologne, sir. I will be back in a second. I hope he doesn’t hurt us, man. Sorry, what am I, chopped liver? What kind of thing is this? He blew my mind away. If I had a son-in-law like him, I would be free of trouble. I checked his finger, there was no wedding ring. He also said he uses perfume. He's a spender. What is going on again, Muzaffer? Be quiet, wife. Luck is at our doorstep right now. God will reward me for all the troubles I’ve suffered in this life. He won’t make me wait for afterlife. Sir, welcome, welcome. Here, come inside. Don’t wait outside. Come inside. Welcome. Please, have a seat. Sir, because of our line of work, we can’t even find two minutes to sit down and relax. So, why are you here again? Could you refresh my memory please? We came here to... I wanted to meet you and hire you to provide food services to my company. Sure. We already service two to three companies. We got that outfit store right down there and also a hardware shop. We know how this works. How many people do you have in your company? About 1,500 employees. Wife, bring my sublingual pill. I'm having a heart attack! Oh, my God, son, my heart. What do you do for living, my boy? I own that skyscraper. I own a construction company. You do have a skyscraper, huh? The man of my dreams. Boy. My boy... Are you... the son of Efe Sultan? I'm sad, oh, I'm sad Sleepless at night Would Efe Sultan have the time to get married and have a son? He's the son of Zeki Atilgan. Is this a parents’ meeting? I'm nobody’s son. I'm Ferhat. Ferhat, let me be clear. My grandfather took a loan of 10,000 liras from his friend to build a business and went to Istanbul years ago. Twenty years later, he had to pay back like $700,000 and he was deep in debt. They even took his underwear. He had to sell even his luggage. So we are not good at doing business. I'm going to ask around and take some advice, then I'm going to give you an offer. Would that be okay? Of course, sir. We want to help small businesses. You, perfumed, handsome boy. I like you. Welcome, my girl. Dad, which idiot owns that car? Let him know it will be all scratched in this neighborhood. We can look after the car. Don’t worry. I'm not talking about the car. It is its owner I'm worried about. Why is he here? This is my car, and we are about to leave. Sorry. Someone parked right in front of our restaurant, -Lett them know they must move it. -Enough of this car topic already. It is like we’ve never seen a car before. We sold one yesterday. Damn! This kid... Ms. Elif. He gave me the toy, aunt. -Aunt. -Mr. Ferhat? My God, you two know each other? Yes, sir, we owe her our thanks. -Is he better now? -He is, thank you. Why are you here? We are here to get an offer from Mr. Muzaffer. It looks like he's really good at his job. Don’t you have employees for this kind of meeting? Of course I do. I have thousands. But, I can’t trust them, can I? I do the meetings in person with people I'm going to work with. Anyway, I don’t want to waste your time any longer. Mr. Muzaffer, we will be in touch. I hope so. Have all a nice day. You're so cute. What do you want to be when you grow up? A pain in the ass! I got my answer. Crazy kid! So you two know each other, huh? I can die happily right now. I caught a burglar in his house, that is all. I don’t know him personally. You don’t need to know him. It takes time. Your mother and I had an arranged wedding. I didn’t know her either. She was pregnant with your sister, and I didn’t even know her name. I called her "wife" during those days back then. I may not know her name even now. I'm sorry, but this is exactly what marriage is. -Serap. -Who is Serap? My mother’s name is Serap, dad! Didn’t you tell me that you wanted that doctor as a son-in-law? No, no way. Heaven forbid. I don’t care about that doctor. My vote is for this man. But this is your choice, of course. He's also handsome. I mean it, he looks good. He has a nice figure. I think so too. My vote is for him also. But he wouldn’t want our girl, though. My girl, you need to pretty yourself up. You need to be charming. Well, if I were a woman... Dad, what are you doing? Come, my boy. She fell in love with me at hello, too. She just can’t admit it yet. She needs time to process all of this. I wish I could spend some time with Elif. Be careful what you wish for. It can happen instantly. My father is calling, be quiet. They called from our ranch. Wild Girl is missing. What? Wild Girl is missing? I was there two days ago. Listen, you're not responsible for this, are you? Dad, she's a horse, a horse! What would I do with Wild Girl? -What kind of son do you think I am? -I'm calling the police now. If you're responsible for it, we are going to have a talk. Dad, please. I have already a lot of responsibilities. Please don’t call the police. I will take care of it. Wild Girl is my favorite horse, she's my sweetheart. I also know a man who is the father of the most skilled police captain in the country. I got this. I know what you're thinking. She's just not a horse. She's my friend, my everything. She's an English thoroughbred. Life will never be the same. I'm not the same either. Mr. Ferhat, may I have a moment of your time? I can give you all the time I have left. We are devastated, as you can see. We would do anything for Wild Girl. This all belongs to us. The ranch is just an excuse. When we find an available land, we buy it right away. Gokhan usually deals with those kind of transactions. By the way, let me introduce myself. I'm Ferhat, he CEO of LSI Corporate group. Isn’t that your father’s company? I used to work with my father too, when I was a little girl, and then I grew up and got a real job. Now, I just pay him a visit once in a while. Ms. Elif, have I done something wrong to you? I know what you're trying to do. Don’t waste your time. What? What am I trying to do? Taking off those glasses and all. What is this about? Do you think you look prettier when you take off those glasses? You look much more handsome when I take off my glasses. I have myopia. It conceals the flaws. Let’s go back to work. Please! Relieve me from my misery already. What the hell? Did you hire anyone new in the past three months? Yes, we hired Omer as a stableman. He's an easy-going person. He wears his heart on his sleeve. He's from our hometown. We wouldn’t expect such a thing from him. Okay. Don't let him know, but provide all information about him to my colleagues. Let’s investigate. There is this urgent matter that we need to kiss each other. I used to work with my father too, when I was a little girl. And then I grew up and had a got job for myself. She treated me like I'm a spoiled child, Gokhan. I need to prove myself to her immediately. She suspects of Omer. While they are messing around we are going to find the horse and prove to her I'm better than her at her job-- Did she know about Omer? How did she find out? Did Omer steal from her? How do you know? I was watching the security cameras. I was about to erase the footage, -then you showed up. -Why? I told them that footage was erased. Why? I don’t know, when we watch it, I thought you would’ve been responsible for her disappearance. Cut this shit. We need to find that horse before they do, Gokhan. Okay, Gokhan. That security guy knows what to do. After causing a malfunction on Omer's car he will give him the keys of company’s car. It has GPS. We will wait here, and the moment the car arrives to its destination, we will catch him in the act. How? It is like we are doing these kind of things every day. -I just broke it, it won't function. -Ferhat, Omer is coming. Hide. Look at him, he knows that he will get caught, He's on the run. Hide behind the car, we will wait there. So Ferhat, the car is working. Didn’t you break it down? I took this from his car. I have no idea how this car can be still functional. This is a battery cover! Did you just take the battery cover to break his car down? I'm sorry, Mr. Gokhan. Does it have any writing on it? Yes, it does. Read. "Battery cover." The car is lighter now. It goes faster. Wait for me, Wild Elif. I'm on his trail. You go and investigate. We’ll see who will win. Gamble accepted. It is not gamble, we say challenge accepted. You don’t even know the right word for it. We are doomed. What are you doing? Are you crying? There is nothing to be afraid of. When we get off, we will have a decent conversation with him. I will say that he's our friend, assure him that we will cover this up. He will give the horse back, we will say our goodbyes, that's all. I'm not upset because of that. Look what I found. What is it doing here? He has a gun. He had a gun. Now, we have it. We have the upper hand. I'm kind of his kin. He wouldn’t shoot me. But, I'm not his kin. Well, you need to save your own skin, Gokhan. Stay behind me. Try to stay calm. He may just shoot you to intimidate me. Look for the exit! Is there no exit? Any windows? There is no door! Do something! I'm stuck. Gokhan, I'm stuck like this. If he caught me in this position, it wouldn’t be good for me. I'm so vulnerable right now to fight back. Even erotic novel writers couldn’t have thought something like this. Stop, be quiet. He will hear us. Don’t be a smart-ass. Stop showing off. Are you showing off to me? Let me get through. I'm stuck too. I can’t move. We are like flies that head-butt the window while trying to get out. Wasn’t it obvious that you wouldn’t be able to get through? -What did you do? -I panicked. I'm stuck like this too, by the way. We literally gave him an opportunity. I could be his kin also so he wouldn’t shoot me either. What do you say? So you're saying that yours is better than mine, in other words. Gokhan, if we push it real hard, we may be able to move it. Try with your back. On three. One... two... Fuck! I said, on three. I panicked. Three! Oh, now I get it. I didn’t leave you, I didn’t. I'm just warming up. We don’t know what is waiting for us inside. I’d flee, if I wanted to. Anyone would flee but me. I didn’t. Because I'm your friend. Calm down. We are finishing this. I will go inside and talk to Omer, and it’ll be over soon. Calm down. This place looks like those houses featured in TV shows where all the murders and kidnappings happen and then are solved. I’d flee, though, if I wanted to. Omer is not in there. There is only one person. Come. You're so confident. What is going on? I'm just going to talk with him, man. Would you want me to break the door also? Look, he's scared of you, and you're scared of him. I was just going to talk to him. What the fuck? -Ferhat! -Omer, what's up? Did you pull a gun on him? And I assumed that he was very happy to see us. Why did you steal the horse, Omer? You're like my kin. Put the gun down. Give the horse back to me and get lost. The police will be here soon. She will be here, I will prove myself to her with the horse. Tell us! Where is the horse? I won’t ask again. Talk to me, you jerk! Gokhan, what the fuck? I'm pumping adrenaline right now. Where is the horse, you douchebag? Talk or I will shoot you! You don’t know how to handle this, just give it a break. -Where is the horse, bro? -She's here. Is this Wild Girl? What have you done to her? Gokhan, they dyed my horse in purple. She has spots. They turned an English thoroughbred into a milk cow. This horse sounds like a cow. They messed up with her. She thinks she is now a cow. Bro, why did you do something like this? Don’t get me wrong, but she was feeling so lonely as a horse here. So we thought of camouflaging it. With some oil paint-- The cops are here! Shoot me if you want, but I'm running off. Where are you going? Why would you chase him? Why would you chase him? What has gotten into you? Hands up! Hands up! We can explain. It is not what it looks like. Mr. Ferhat. Is that a gun? Drop it! -Why did you throw it at me? -I panicked, I just panicked! Captain. "Nuri plastic, made in China." The horse is in the stable. They dyed it. What were you two doing with the missing horse? -And what’s with the toy gun? -What? That wasn’t a real gun? I threatened him with a toy gun? I think my blood sugar just plummeted. I wonder if there is something to eat in the car like cheese or bread. I also kicked him. I'm about to black out. Mr. Ferhat, I really hope you are not responsible for this incident. Ms. Elif, she's just a horse. Sorry Ms. Elif, may I call you Elif? -No. -Okay. Ms. Elif, she's my horse. The thief just ran away. Also why would I do that? We will find out. Take them. Go, go, go. Wait a second. Be gentle with her. She's shy, move. Here, my girl, here. Calm down. I could have fled. A horse is like its master. She's just depressed. My beautiful, my Wild Girl. Ferhat’s most beloved, this dye will come out. Calm down, girl. Did they make you sad? My precious. My sweetheart. My Wild Girl. We are respected business people. Please. Why would I steal my own horse? We were there to help you. Then why did you erase the security footage? You were going to take the insurance money by stealing the horse, right? Well, you never cease to surprise me! It is on me. How did that happen? Mister, your spit spread all over us. It got on me too. Let us do our job. What are you doing here? You are everywhere. Officer, am I under arrest? He's beating me while I'm in your care. He's right. Please, sir. What are you doing? I'm like his father. They are both kind of my boys. My own father just said I'm "kind of" his son. Shut up! You prick! I was going to say not to hit him, just me. He's an important CEO You asshole! I didn’t feel it. He spit on my forehead. Man, how did you do that? How did you spin it like that? -Did it hit you? -Go inside, move. This is not the retirement I had in mind. I was mowing the grass this morning. Now, I'm at the police station. They caught the guy who threw himself out of the window. They are still looking for Omer. He’ll be found soon. Just sign your statements and you may leave. Hikmet, just wrap things up. It is getting late. I'm leaving to go to my restaurant. Have a nice day. Be ready for cross-examination. There is no cross-examination. When were you going to tell me there was a burglar in the house? -They just told me. -Dad, it wasn’t important. Shut up, you prick! Man, you just hit the driver with it. This is getting dangerous, stop it. Why can’t I do that? Maybe there is something wrong with your teeth, Uncle Zeki. What is it to you? She caught the burglar, saved the horse and both of you. We owe her a great debt of gratitude. Then let’s thank her together while things are still hot. I know where Ms. Elif is. Let's go. She offers food to the people in need. She finds time to do that too? This is the child I have dreamt of. Dad, are we going inside? Go, Ferhat! Find out if she's seeing someone. She can still be my daughter. Probably, I would like her much more than I like you. Thanks, dad. Here is our favorite candidate. I will be inside. Sister, wait. Ms. Elif. We couldn’t find a chance to thank you. If you can accept these... It is okay. That is my job. Also, I didn’t do it alone. It was a team effort. Yes, we should be thanking all at the police station. I will do that first thing in the morning. I wanted to thank you first. Where should I put these? Let me take them. This is a wonderful thing to do. Can we help? Why not? Come on. You can serve them. This is a nice feeling, isn’t it? Doing good things without expecting anything in return. My God, if you grant my wish, I will sacrifice a camel for you. Thank you. Don’t get me wrong... but would you accept a donation? -Donation? -Yes. You got it wrong. This is not a charity organization. Why would you need an intermediary to do some good anyway? -It wouldn’t be like this. -I only meant... that this is a really good thing to do for others. Do you want to do it too? God only knows all the opportunities you have to do something good. Start with your own environment. Actually, this is the exact place where my story began. The thing I needed to understand was just right front of me. Did I understand it, though? Sort of. So I told myself that I needed to start with my own environment. Yes, you see them right. I've got four water fountains for you. From now on, water is free, courtesy of our company. I can see your enthusiasm. No need for applause. Congratulations. You went to her restaurant once and look what happened. How do you know? Are you following me? Yes. You should know it by now. I’ve been doing it for like, 30 years. Let’s work hard for that bid first, we talk about this later. We can take care of it. It's almost finished. Let’s go to the police station and thank them in person. I had a wreath made for them. We are in debt. Let’s send it then. Why are we going in person? Maybe I could see Elif. We are doomed. This is the place. He hasn’t done any good to anyone his whole life, but he thinks he's an opinion leader. -What‘s with the wreath? -Just take it. Good thing we came with a rental. It is full of scratches. I told you it would. They will be pissed when we return it. Sirs, hello. May I have your attention fora minute? Here you go, Mr. Ferhat. We didn’t have a chance to thank all of you properly yesterday. Please accept this wreath as a token of our deepest apologies. Leave it outside. There is an empty area over there, just leave it there. Excuse me, bro. Hello, everybody. The doc is here. My man is here. The divine light of my eyes, welcome. I’ve missed you, my love. -I'm talking with my wife. -Talk to her outside, don’t scare us. I thought you all must be hungry. If I invited you to a dinner, you wouldn’t come so I'm here instead. Enjoy all. You didn’t have to bother. You're making us all embarrassed. Look, he even remembers I don't like onions on mine. What is going on? It looks like he's besties with all of them. What is he doing here? Is Ms. Elif here? We were supposed to go for a bite. You were supposed to do what? -Boss, what’s up? -Stay away! What are you doing here? Weren’t you supposed to be in the hospital? It is my off day. Welcome. Do you guys know each other? -We are friends from high school. -I'm his boss. Onay... I need to take care of something first. Would you give me a couple of hours? Sure. No problem. Same place, right? The one on the back alley. Okay, perfect. See you then. I'm leaving the rest of the wraps on here. Enjoy, guys. -Ferhat, my dear. -Leave already! Gokhan, honey. Onay, you prick. Come, I can offer you some tea. I don’t drink tea, Ms. Elif. Because I'm starving. I'm very hungry. I need to eat something as soon as possible. I mean, if it’s okay for you-- What is this? Sorry, Ms. Elif. There are lots of wraps, and I thought that it would be a nice thing to feed him too. That’s so thoughtful of you. Okay, thank you. I'm eating this. Also, you made me upset. Have fun. Ms. Elif. This wreath can be still useful. -Do you want some vegetables in it? -No! I will totally eat it. -Where did we park the car? -Right here. Right over there, under the sign of no parking. -So, they towed it. -Shit! I saw it, but you were speaking at that moment, -and I didn't want to interrupt you. -We were here for five minutes! -Why would they tow it? -Because I called them. Hikmet, you really didn’t like us. Taxi! No need for a taxi. That parking lot is right over there. It is close. Thank you, officer. It is not close, bro. They will walk a lot. So much the better. He was rude to the doctor. I'm pissed because of it. You did well. We've been walking for like, 40 minutes. He did it on purpose. -I’ve got blisters on my feet. -We should at least leave this wreath. Why are we still carrying it? I want to use the herbs in it. This was the first time we thanked anyone for anything, and look how they treated us! You shouldn’t have made that last move, Hikmet. Are you upset with something, bro? He said to put it the empty area. They all teamed up with that doc, I'm telling you. They were trying to destroy you, so to speak. No way! The game is on now! Move! I’ll drive the car. Give me that white key. Give it to me! Elif and him are going out for lunch. It would be beneath us. What? That doesn’t mean they are lovers. Maybe they are just friends. That doctor kissed you, kissed me. He didn’t kiss her. Those officers are trying to hook her up with that doctor with cheap theatrics. -Who knows, right? -Smart ones know. Move! Who are you? Call that snitch of ours, Emre. We have a field work for him. He will go to that restaurant where they are going to have a lunch. He will have a table next to them. In secret. He will take notes about everything that they talk about. We will find out soon enough. You don’t have any greys, damn. Blacks and whites only. Mr. Gokhan. Mr. Ferhat, what’s with the wreath? Is that a camouflage? Yes, Emre, it is a camouflage, Emre. He's also just another prick. Mr. Gokhan, please don’t get mad. That show was for me? Are you showing off to me? Look up. I’ve coated that asphalt that you drive on. Be a man! Emre, you have a job to do. Give me that flash drive. I will work on our bid. Don’t let our blood spilled for nothing. Man, don’t say something like that. You're scaring him. Find a table next to them. Takes notes about everything they talk about. It may seem irrelevant to our work. Don’t worry. They talk in codes. I can encode it, you can’t. Don’t worry. Go. Move! I see him everywhere. Efe Sultan. When I'm done with this, I will deal with you also. I'm going to grab that project. Love the God Admire the God Tell me, what happened? Watch the mole Admire the mole Admire the mole What happened? Something happened. I turned him down without hurting his feelings. You turned a food engineer down last year. You're definitely playing hard to get. You have turned engineers and doctors down. It is a cliché. What did you say to him? According to her, he's good and handsome, he can have all the girls he wants. So? He's so handsome that if he puts his picture online, he can get at least thousand likes. If I were a girl, I’d give it to you. Elif said that? No, I'm exaggerating it. It is my thing. Ready? Here comes the killing blow. She said to him she in love with someone else. I knew it, I knew they are not lovers. Who is the man she loves? Who is he? Of course, it is you. But... to make sure... a little... bit of information... would be nice, though. She did, she did. She gave him my description down to the last detail. That doc is a perfect guy already. There is no side of him that you have to change. He's already decent. So he couldn’t be your type. Are we still on the same topic? What’s wrong with it? People wouldn’t change, Elif. Don’t try to change men, accept them for who they are. Listen, that habit of mine cost me my marriage. Anyway. What else did you say to him? I let him know that I have platonic crush and he doesn’t even know that I have feelings for him and I dropped the subject. That’s it? Didn’t you tell him anything else? Wasn’t that more than enough? I'm not her friend. I don’t even know that she has feelings for me. It is done. Let me see, let me see if it’s true. I see a huge stick for you, man. -I think you will get a beating. -Let me see. Is that a stick? It has curled edges. Exactly. It is a knotty wood. -That will be a hell of a beating. -That’s Elif. The first letter of Elif. She's my destiny. Gokhan, I think I have never fallen in love before. It’s like, I have butterflies n my stomach. I have found the woman of my life. I will have what I’ve wished for. I think I have a clean heart. I think so, too. Very clean. Since you haven’t used that before, it is so clean. Have you ever used your heart all this time? And this had to be in the same time with the bid. I'm going nuts! There are most important things in life than work. We are doomed. Doomed, doomed. Maybe that platonic crush of yours is that rich guy, right, Elif? What was his name? Mahmut? -Ferhat? -I know his name, I was just testing you. I heard Hikmet was talking behind him. Ferhat is a raw marble in his eyes. And did you like that comment? He doesn’t even know that women in our family have this Michelangelo virus. Elif could see the work of art inside that raw marble. Sis, you're overreacting. He's not that bad. He's not? Let’s try to look at the bright side of things. My father is so close to being the happiest man on earth because of him. I'm sorry, Captain Elif, but our guys caught the horse thief. Take him to the interrogation room. I will be there in half an hour. Bring the complainants too. Do we always have to watch her behind the windows, Ferhat? Any progress? Dad, why are you waving your hand? She can’t see us. Why did you steal the horse? I needed it. -The horse? -No, the money. You had everything you need! Who were you going to sell it to? And why specifically Wild Girl? He wouldn’t say. He wouldn’t say. Your relatives haven’t sued you yet. We haven’t? What is she saying? We will sue him, officer. They told me that you have two children. One of them is getting a good education. -Did you tell her? -Does he have kids? She knows her stuff. If I were Ferhat, I would have no pity on you. You don’t deserve it. That’s more like it. That horse has no value as an animal. He told me that I could steal any horse from their ranch. And I stole one of them. -Who told you that? -A John Doe. Look at me! I swear I don’t know who he is. He didn’t tell me his real name. It is registered on my phone, you can check it. He's starting to talk. We are on this, don’t worry. -I'll inform you of further developments. -Thank you, our precious. I mean, our precious captain. You were amazing back in there. We were impressed. What was there to impress you? I wouldn’t know any other way. Goodness only brings goodness. Goodness only... brings goodness, That's what I told myself. This is why we have gathered right here today. Everything was so clear this time. Did I see it though? Sort of. So I'm doing you a favor without expecting anything in return. Water is free, I got this mountain just for you. It is fountain, not mountain. You don’t even know the right word for it. I was thinking of buying a simple one, but then, when I thought about it, I'm not the old Ferhat anymore. I'm a new and different person. And our people have this terrible habit of drinking water from tap by mouth. I thought about it also and took and extra precaution. MISTER FERHAT MOUNTAIN And we would be laughing at those who want to drink it from tap by mouth. I'm going to deal with it today, Gokhan. I will take her father’s blessing, and then invite her to dinner. Just relieve me of my duty first so one of us can still go and work. I need you, I can’t do this without you. I'm shocked. Okay, then. Mr. Muzaffer. Good morning. Who are you again? You look familiar, have we met before? We were here the other day with Ferhat, remember? Oh, were you here with him? I didn’t notice you. Welcome, Ferhat. How are you, Ferhat? What is it? You seem upset. Did you sleep well? Do you have a gas problem? How did you know? I do. Well, well. Come here, my boy, come. Sir, what are you doing? Please, don’t. Excuse me. I feel much better now. I’ve raised children before, you know. So what is it? Sir, I’d like to talk a delicate matter with you. I see. Son... go grab some assorted nuts for yourself, and eat them over there. We have something private and delicate to discuss. Wait outside. Bring the change. It has become a habit for him lately. Damn you, Mr. Ferhat. What is troubling you? You can talk to me. Tell me. Mr. Muzaffer... my trouble is as dangerous as missing the last ferry. Have you ever suffered from love? So? Have you ever suffered from love? Have you ever passed a kidney stone before, Ferhat!? I’ve passed three times! I thought I was dying on the third one. I just sat and cried, you see? It was like, I'm about to die, but it didn’t let me die peacefully! What doesn’t kill me, it doesn’t make me stronger either. That was my lesson. It makes you crawl! I lost half of my life in there. Think about it. There is this thing as big as a bead coming out from your thing, while you're peeing. It makes you cry, my boy. I shouted like, “Shoot me, shoot me so I can die and rest." Why are you telling me all this? What you got is not a real problem. That is what I'm trying to tell you. -But, sir-- -Quiet. -Sir-- -Let me! -My intention-- -Don’t interrupt! -My intention-- -Listen! -Sir, my-- -Son! You're a rich man! Wouldn’t it be beneath you? Suffering from love and all, huh? Get your facts straight! Sir, my intentions are serious. -If you let me to talk-- -I won’t! I can’t! Why would I? You're like a mountain, take a look at yourself. If she didn’t love you back, it would be her loss. If she upsets you, she will face my wrath! Sir, I think you're mad at me. Please don’t get me wrong. I'm here because I wanted your blessing to talk with your daughter, sir. Doing otherwise would be wrong. What daughter? I’d like to invite Ms. Elif to dinner. I wanted to take your blessing first to talk with your daughter, sir. Is it a wrong thing to do? I will be right back. My God... thank you for granting my wish. He's not a religious person, what is he doing? Serap, good morning. Where is Betul? She's not answering. Today is my day with the kids. Welcome. But didn’t Muzaffer tell you not to come here again? Don’t make him mad, please. Mom, let me. Weren’t you told that you were not to come here again, boy? Mom? Wait, who is this gentleman? No need to know me. Why are you here? Sir, this is a family matter. Don’t get involved please. Let's say I'm kind of part of this family. And it concerns me from now on. Okay? Really! How did you do this to me? I mean, If I knew, I’d bring some gifts for both of you. Anyway, you should also know that today is my day with the kids, sir. It's my legal right, but she doesn’t give them to me on time deliberately. I'm the victim here. This seems to be a family matter. Sorry, sir, I didn’t know. So what, my boy? They woke up late. So what, huh? So what? Sir, please don’t interfere. We talked about this minutes ago. Don’t point that finger at me, and get rid of that bag. We have family elders here, don’t bully me in front of them. Ferhat, let it go, my boy. Let it go. Leave it to me, dad! He called me dad. -Dad? Damn. -Come here. Dad, I'm taking him outside for two minutes. -But sir, if you let me talk-- -Quiet, move. But sir, I'm asking you, please. I will beat you with a belt from a distance. Excuse me, sir, would you mind if I ask for a spare ticket to take a bus? He does. I'm not this kind of person. I don’t deserve to be a father. I wish Betul happiness. Wait, son. You got it wrong. Let that prick go. He barely pays us 300 liras of alimony per month. We have the smallest amount of alimony in the neighborhood. The kid is wasted. Are you okay, son? Hey, bro! We are not dead yet. Where are you going? Exactly, we are not dead yet. Hit us more. Don’t leave us hanging. Finish us. We would be so upset. Ferhat that coffee reading came true, you see? It wasn’t a knotty wood, though. Because this guy is short, it was an image of this guy. Gokhan, I think you hit your head pretty hard, go wait in the car. You didn’t think that he could move like that, did you? You could’ve asked me, though. He's a boxer. Where did he hit you? Here. And here. You're good at getting a beating. Thank you, Mr. Muzaffer. You're so kind. You're a traditional guy, so you convinced me. You have my permission. You can have dinner with Elif. But only once. Okay? When will you meet? Let me talk to Elif first. She doesn’t know. You haven’t talked to Elif yet. Oh. I know my daughter. It won't work. It will be hard for you. -Really. -Anyway, we will see. So you need to conquer the castle from the inside. We will work together. Don’t worry. I have great plans. What are you doing tonight? I told you you'd get roughed up in this neighborhood. You didn't listen. Nice, nice. Love is in the air. What kind of talk is this, Muzaffer? In front of the kid. You shouldn’t say something like that. Why did you take it personally? It has nothing to do with you, wife. Is this supposed to be an apology? So that love you smell in the air belongs to someone else? It has nothing to do with me either. Don’t smear me. Am I the one smelling love in the air? Wife, give it a break. For God’s sake. It is not about us. What was I saying? I was saying something. What did I say? I said something. I said surprises, little surprises are really important in life. In fact, those little surprises-- I hope he gets better. It is sad that people have problems this late at night. Maybe someone is dead or barely alive. Who knows? Please, go to bed. Please! That ambulance is coming this way. I hope it is not here for a friend. It is right here. Do you see, Muzaffer? Being a good neighbor is really hard. We live in the same street, and yet we don’t know anything about each other. I was saying something. I had started with "surprise." You blew it. That ambulance just stopped in front of our apartment. Neighbor, who is it here for? For Riza? Why would it be for me? Heaven forbid! Riza, after your wife passed away, they told us you wouldn’t also live that long. That’s why I thought it had come for you. It is a rumor. I didn’t like her that much. Also, I did some calculations. I can live another ten years with my pension. Otherwise, it won’t cover my expenses, after all those salary cuts. He has no intention to die. He would bury us first. It is here for number six. What? Number six? We are the number six. Good evening. We heard that a patient is losing blood. What patient? You're on the wrong address. I think he's in the back room. Let us through. Son, wait a second. Who is losing blood? Someone is losing blood in my own house and I don’t know anything about it? Let’s see, why is he losing blood? Let me ask. Which back room-- Perfumed, handsome boy. What are you doing here? -Ferhat, what are you doing? -How are you? I had this little surprise for you. Through my research, I found out you really love yellow tulips. I was going to pour them down from the balcony, but the molding broke. I got cuts on my hands and feet. God literally damned me. I was about to die. But son, why did you call for an ambulance? You're a young man. You could take a little amount of blood loss. You wouldn’t die. Now, we'll be the talk of this area. How are we going to explain this? Muzaffer? Sir, I was going to shout, but you’d mistake me for a thief and get scared. The ambulance was a clear solution. So, Ms. Elif? Do you like them? -I don’t like yellow tulips. -You don’t? Who was the one who likes yellow tulips? Someone did. My shop is filled with yellow tulips. Wife? I love them. We were close You were close! You were close! You brought my wife’s favorite flowers. If I didn’t know you had good intentions, I’d be the one to make you bleed. These people would be here because of that. Anyway, they are here. -Guys, you can take him. -Wait. Poor guy, what has gotten into you? He's trying to thank us. My name is Muzaffer. I will be victorious. I will turn the tide. What are you saying, husband? I'm saying that we are so rude. He got injured in our house. Are we going to watch him like this, from this balcony? No, I'm going to bed. I'm going to wash the dishes. No! You're coming with me! Now! Slowly. Real slow. It is over, go away. -Is that it? -Yes. Did you send me that text message saying, “I'm dying, save me” only for this. Forget about me. You called for an ambulance only for this? This is the right hospital, right? Go, go! I'm a little bit obsessed with this issue, I guess. I see him everywhere. Girl, I just saw your father running after 30 years. Something’s happening to him. Mom? Onay works here, I don’t want to see him. You go, I will wait here. Elif! Sorry. You're back. I'm sure you two have things to talk about. I should go inside. Muzaffer, they are here. Here! I know, wife. I saw them, but couldn’t slow down. I ran too fast. I will run back. Wait for me. -What happened to you, are you okay? -I'm fine, thanks. It is my heart. Let me catch my breath, it’ll pass. Mr. Muzaffer, welcome. You didn’t have to-- My heart! That sounded like a hiccup. Right? Muzaffer, what is going on? Are you okay? Doctor! Help me! Don’t panic. Let me. I’ve taken first aid courses all year. They all were for today, I guess. No need to waste time. One, and two, and three. Mr. Muzaffer, you're not responding to the treatment. One, and two, and three. Thank you. Ferhat, you just saved my life. Don’t say that, sir. Anyone would’ve done the same thing. No one would have done this, Ferhat. They would’ve said, “We are already in a hospital, it is not necessary to save him.” Wife, get me some water. Right away, husband. Right away. Thank you, God. Where is the doctor? Doctor! Ferhat, what was that, my son? You owe me an explanation. Why didn’t you call the doctor? -Sir, I know how to do a basic CPR. -But I didn’t know that. Look around you, my son. We are in the hospital. No need for heroism. When I said I was feeling ill, you should've called the doctor. The doctor would check me, give me a serum and that would be the end of it. But I thought it was real. I didn’t understand you were faking it. I was going to tell the story later, say that I would’ve been dead, if I hadn’t come visit Ferhat. It was fate that I'm still alive, thanks to Ferhat. And we were going to sell this story perfectly. That was an awesome plan. Who are you? You look familiar, have we met before? Go ahead, Muzaffer. -Drink it. -Thanks. He can’t save me to his memory drive, I guess. He acts like I'm the wrong number. Thank you, wife. -Please, bring me another one. -Sure. Put some ice in it. Where is the doctor? What kind of first aid was that? You couldn’t even find my pulse. Why did you press down that hard on a beating heart? It could've malfunctioned, and then I'd literally die. I'm already a rotten egg. What just happened? -Sir, I got panicked-- -Get off! No one has ever kissed me but my wife. What luck. You're the second person now. There is a huge age difference between us, you could’ve shown some respect. I was about to die, and he was groping me, kissing me. I saw it. It was a CPR, sir, not groping. I'm sorry. Here, Muzaffer. It has ice in it. Thank you, wife. We owe you our thanks. You can ask me anything. Don’t be shy. Yes. There was that thing about a dinner. I don’t know if this is the right time for it, though. Of course, my son. Don’t mention it. Bring your parents to our home for dinner tomorrow evening. Sure. This is exactly what he meant. Do you think they need that? Wife, you always put the cart before the horse. How could I compete with you? Never. Let me through, I'm a doctor! Stop! Ferhat kissed me already! Is this your turn now? Leave me alone! -Ferhat? -Ferhat? Yes, my girl. He knew how to do CPR. He saved you father’s life. -Ferhat! -Ferhat! -Are you okay? -No. Look, look. He's limping. Don’t fake it, don’t! Elif, don’t believe him. It was just a splinter. He's obsessed with me. He must be jealous. Why would the doctor be jealous of you? While he was flirting with you here, I was up there, kissing your father. I mean, saving his life. Of course, he's jealous. Here comes the glasses again. I think this is some sort of intimidation. Ferhat, I know what you're trying to do. Give me a chance. You’ve done so many things for me. -At least, I can take you to din-- -I haven’t done those things for you. It is my job. Have you ever thought about it? Do you think all this is just a coincidence? My horse got stolen, my house got robbed. This has all happened to bring us together. You see? If he hadn't stolen specifically Wild Girl, no one would've done anything about it before this important bid. Important bid? It is tomorrow. We’ve been working for three months to be ready for it. Why didn’t you tell me this before? What kind of laughter is that? Of course, it is not a coincidence. Come here, I'm not done yet. Dinner? What happened? Look, she just ran away. Good, I'm feeling good right now. Every bad has its worse. Prick. It will happen soon, Gokhan. I kissed her father, I will kiss her soon. Did you kiss him deliberately? Yes. Everything was so clear in this plan. I'm so pissed about that tulip thing. And I should've called the doctor. Why am I such an idiot? You're in deeper trouble than you think you are. -It is about to become an organized crime. -Sure, sure. The others collaborated and got away. -Do you have something to say? -I'm not saying anything. John Doe. God damn you. How can I help, captain? What did they ask you to steal from Ferhat’s house? Let me explain, captain. They said there was this flash drive with crucial information in it. I looked for it. They also said I needed to make a mess to make it look like a basic robbery. I couldn’t find the flash drive. So I was going to take the TV. Then you showed up. I'm carrying it with me all the time. Here is our proposal. They were looking for this. In the house and in the ranch. Omer was looking for the flash drive also. He also made it look like a basic robbery by stealing the horse. According to them, they couldn’t find it in the office either-- Did they check the office too? They couldn’t be here, only I have the keys. And Emre has it. -Emre doesn’t have it, we took it. -Sorry. -Only I have it. -Right. So bro, do you know what that means? It happened bro, it finally happened. High five! Thank you, God. I'm so happy right now. We finally did it. Guys, are you okay? This company has been here for 50 years. My grandfather, and my father were in charge. -But did any of them achieve such a thing? -No! But this is our second year, things are getting exciting. We’ve brought this company to this point where they couldn’t in the past. And Game of Thrones has begun. And this is the best part that we’ve been ignoring. Now, it will be more much fun. They see us as their equals. We are in the same league now, Efe Sultan. I knew this day will come eventually. Attack me! Attack me with your full power. Guys, I don’t want to interrupt your moment of joy, but your classified documents were about to get stolen. Just like you said. They were about to. But it didn’t happen. Thanks to you. I guess I'm in a greater debt to you. Yes, this time you owe me big time. I was ahead of myself. I saved a big company. Move, move. It is just a dinner. Move, dork. Move. I won’t become hopeful. If you want to reject me, do that on that dinner. You turned down the doctor over a dinner. Do the same to me, if you want. How do you know that I turned down the doctor over dinner? I know that I shouldn’t say anything, but I have to, Ferhat. -Betul told me. -My sister? -Her sister? -My sweetie. What kind of nonsense is this? She doesn’t even know you. Well? That’s what you think. We’ve been keeping a low profile relationship since the day we met. We are making love like crazy, guys. Uludag is our witness. My love doesn’t keep anything from me. She was going to tell you this... in person... but I couldn’t wait her to tell you. You don’t expect me to believe this, do you? The doctor is your friend, did he tell you that? The doctor is our friend. He could’ve told us. Why didn’t you think that? Moron. Why would I lie to you? If you don’t believe me, call your sister and ask. Why did you do this? Why did you tell her? Man, did you really seduce her sister? Yes, what’s the big deal? Look, we are brothers-in-law now. When I realized you're serious with her, I needed to protect you, brother-in-law. Crazy dude! Stop with this! When you dump her sister, she won't be with me even if she wants to. Brother-in-law, why would I dump your sister-in-law? She's like Seda Sayan, she's so blunt. She also has two kids. She left all of those pregnancy, postnatal, new born baby issues behind. We won’t be dealing with that. She's also beautiful. It was a package deal. I won’t let that beating I had from her ex go to waste. No way. That Muzaffer will memorize my name along with my surname! He will know me when he sees me. Is this your ambition? I wouldn’t be surprised if I saw anything else in this life. -Saturday, eight o’clock. -What? Dinner. I barely convinced her for this weekend. Pick her up at our house at 8 p.m. on Saturday. Don’t come into the house. Just pick her up from the door. I’ve done my part. It is your turn now. You shouldn’t talk big, Ferhat. Quiet, you big pumpkin. We also will have a conversation. Your time will come. I will show you that Uludag. What will you show me at Uludag? Telfer, Telfer. Brother-in-law, why did you cover that Emre thing in front of my sister-in-law? I will take care of Emre myself. He was our most trusted guy. Traitor. Call him. If you're still stubborn, one single incident would be enough to make you understand it. When you look back, you’ll realize that you deserved it. I'm here, Mr. Ferhat. I came rushing from my home. Sorry, my shirt is a little bit messy. I'm sorry. Get the fuck outta here. Mr. Gokhan, what are you doing? Sorry. I got angry. Then you should express your feelings. Fuck you, you prick! Who do you think you are? We know everything. Mr. Ferhat, have I done something wrong? Cut it, we know everything. John Doe, our ranch, robbery in our house, our office searched. But they couldn’t find it. The police was just here. Your people talked. Cut it out. Emre... is there anything you want to tell me? There is. Never mind, that’s it then. There is no such a thing that we will succeed every time. -Things can happen. -Why are you so relaxed, brazen? Shut up! Is there anyone in this company who wouldn’t betray you? Except Gokhan. We know Gokhan. You should’ve taken the deal that Efe Sultan offered you. You have potential. You would be useful. But now you will be a waste while working for him. I didn’t accept it, of course. This is our company. He looks so shocked. The son of Mr. Zeki had no idea. -My name is Ferhat! -Look, he's so angry, you see? Whenever you come here, you think of your father, obviously. That's why you put these pictures everywhere, right? You don’t want to be remembered as the son of Mr. Zeki but Mr. Ferhat, right? We are alike. Turn around. That picture of Efe Sultan. That wasn’t for you. It is there for me. But you got it wrong as well. While you're working, you have your back against it, but I have to stare it in the face, the picture of my father. Do you still think that you know everything? Does Efe Sultan have a son? But you're right. Since we are not as popular as you are, you didn’t see a single photograph of me and my father together. I used to be pissed at my father when I was a kid. I thought he was ashamed of me, but it looks like he's a man of vision. Can you even compete with a man who makes you pay a salary to his own son for years? What kind of person are you? That was nice. Okay. Don’t fire me. I will quit. You can keep my compensation as your spending money. My gift to you, son of Mr. Zeki. Grow the hell up! It is not even fun. Later. He's just going freely. Do we call the police? He just confessed. No. Don’t let him see Elif. We made him listen to her date. He texted us everything. If he bumps into Elif, he could do anything. It is so beyond us, Gokhan. Being someone else is something that we all dream of. Most of us will face the truth that we will never be that someone we want to be. Like myself. And this was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever had. TWO DAYS LATER Ferhat, I can’t take it anymore. He will bring the whole house down on us. Everyone can do it, why can’t I do it? I messed it up. It looks like you didn’t bid on that project. -Efe Sultan got it? -No, I didn’t. I think I messed it up, dad. My methods didn’t work. Since your retirement is not really going peacefully, you should come back to the company. For a while. I have a lot to learn from you. Maybe working old-style is much more effective. Pardon? Old-style. Maybe. Go and call for a plumber, please. This is such a hard thing to do! I’ll take that as a yes, then. Any update on Elif? 7.58 PM SATURDAY -What happened? -Is the dinner cancelled? No, I'm on my way. My girl, don’t be like this. I have much more make up on my face than yours. Why aren’t you ready ? Why did you put foundation, Muzaffer? Mom, he also applied some mascara on his eyelashes and moustache. It is a mascara for men. I thought we could have a family photo and post it on Facebook. Look at her, she's looks like she's going for a picnic. Sister, why are you dressed up? I'm just meeting with some friends. Maybe you should wear something else. Sister, it is just a dinner. I'm leaving. I will be back in a couple of hours. I won’t be late. You can be late. It is clear to me now that two children are not enough. If you have five, six children, one might not marry a rich guy, then any of the others will. But I have limited opportunities. Good evening, Elif. Your prince charming is here. I'm not a prince, though. I'm just charming with a horse. But it counts. Yes, it does! This is good! You charming guy! You're embarrassing us. Horses are a part of our culture. Why would you feel embarrassed? So... horse, beloved, Ferhat. Also, Wild Girl wanted to thank you. I couldn’t leave her behind. Jump on and let's get this night started. Excuse me? Me, ride a horse? No way. Come on, just jump on. The rest will come. It feels like flying, they say. Ferhat, I said no. There is no way I ride that horse. We will see. Come. You're so stubborn! What would you lose if you rode with me? Driver, take the right! Choose where you want to sit. Where should we sit? This restaurant is empty. There is no one here. I've reserved the whole restaurant just for us. I thought you might not want to get disturbed by other people. You can sit anywhere. Why do you insist on acting like that? You're uncouth. This is the Ferhat I'm talking about. He could reserve restaurants for the night. He could buy staff to serve him. He would want people around him. I don’t know, you shouldn’t let your money defining-- Good evening, ma'am. You're his girlfriend, I suppose? I hope we didn’t open a restaurant in a wrong place. I'm not his girlfriend, I'm here just to eat. I'm sorry, our uncouth here closed your restaurant for tonight. What? Closed? We haven’t had the opening yet. It will be open in two weeks. We were told this was for a good cause. We couldn’t deny it. What are you doing? My job, mademoiselle. Terrace is available. Thank you, sir. May I have a menu? Menu? It is so boring. It has long writings on it. We have one with the pictures. I’ll bring the chef. Ma'am. Mr. Ferhat will have the same thing you order. Your wish is my command. So, you're good at cooking then? My father is also a chef. I know my stuff. Is this your father’s work? No, this is my real job, ma'am. It is not the same thing as playing in your father’s workplace. I'm so happy right now. So I will watch you while you prepare the food. Do your best, chef. I will be watching you. What are you doing, ma'am? I'm taking these outside. Please, leave them to the waiter. Sister, what are you doing? What are you doing, are you trying to get me fired? Just leave it! Leave it, leave, leave. Welcome. It is a tradition in the restaurant, I guess. I'm not a fan of it either, but the boss makes me do it. I’ve kissed her three times already before the dinner. Let’s hope for the best. For salads, Elif, we have gavur dagi, shepherd’s salad, seasonal salad, caesar. No, thanks. Elif? How about some lahmacun, lentil cheese, thin bread, or meatballs as starters? -Or Tatarian minced meat? -No, thank you. As appetizers, we have saksuka, artichoke, Russian salad, potato salad and haydari. Please, we don’t want anything else. Kunefe for dessert? I'd be ready by the end of your meal. We don’t want anything else! Got it? Why are you yelling at me? The boss told me to ask, and I asked. I'm going to get Ferhat then. I just totally ripped my shirt off. This wasn’t my intention. I was going to turn that jacket inside out and put it on this shirt. It was set. Literally, I'm holding a white flag. Also, I have six-pack like cold drinks. Now. I wish you hadn’t done that. We were having so much fun. What? Fireworks. What has that got to do with me? Is that a name? Isn’t that the letter of “E” This is so rude. What has that got to do with me? Here comes the “L.” Is this a coincidence now? There is no such a thing as coincidence. “Elite palm reading?" What the hell? So all that glitters isn’t gold, is it? I'm sorry, it just happened as you joined me. So, I was wrong. Don’t worry about it, but get used to it. I'm not that spoiled child you think I am, Elif. I'm a little of everything. And you're very judgmental. I think so, yes. So do you like it? Our chef is very famous. He adds love and passion to his food instead of salt. It is much more healthy this way. -But you insist on adding salt-- -Love? In three days? Right, I'm such an idiot! Can you love someone in three days? Love should be like mine. At first sight. Maybe, at first smile. Are you serious? Are you going to sit here like this? What should I have done? Shouldn’t I have given my shirt? Protecting and looking after him is another part of my job. I'm so glad that you're here. We’ve been trying to find a chance to meet you as well I have so many things I want to ask. I don’t know where to start. If I may, I will begin with the most important one that I'm curious about. Of course, go ahead. Let us get to know each other. Did you breastfeed him? Yes. For how long? About 15 months. He wouldn’t get sick then. Our daughters didn’t. We fed them with baby formula. It didn’t go dry, though. I drank all that milk so it wasn’t a total waste. I'm still so strong now thanks to that. Breast milk is really healthy. Right, Muzaffer? This is such an important topic. Please, eat. More is coming. Please, there will be more. He's really good at talking nonsense, wife. He would be a nice partner in my retirement. Ferhat, I must admit I was wrong about you. Elif, I must say that you're beautiful. Don’t laugh. You're everything that I’ve longed for. Protect me. You wouldn’t lose anything, but I would lose everything. If you hadn't entered into my life, I wouldn’t have thought of opening a restaurant where homeless people cook for homeless people. KITCHEN OF THE STREET Do you like it? I have told you, right? We have a grand opening in two weeks. Maybe I haven’t done everything right so far, but if you hold my hand... And people change. My boy, my dear boy. Let me ride it, it is my turn. Come on, daddy.
