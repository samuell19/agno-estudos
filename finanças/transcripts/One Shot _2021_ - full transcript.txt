- When people find out you're a team guy, first question they ask is, "how many people have you killed?" Nobody ever asks how many people you've saved. Ma'am, you okay? Nauseous? - It's my first time in a helicopter. - Take some deep breaths, okay? Look out at the horizon. - I'm fine. - She barfs, I ain't moppin' it up. - Visual on location. - Danny. All right, listen up. We're scheduled to be on the ground no more than 20 Mikes Max. Soon as the paperwork's been filed, we take the detainee into custody, then we bounce back to the respondent's airbase. Time is of the essence, gentlemen... is that clear? - Yes, sir. - Roger that. Ma'am, I need you to stay close to us till the transfer. Okay? — okay. Hey, you sure you're... - We know what this guy's deal is, exactly? The brief doesn't say. - He's a person of interest in a time-sensitive matter. - Not important who he is or what he's done. We have orders to transfer him, double time, in and out. - Y'all, I'm thinking this guy can't be as important as y'all say he is. - Oh, yeah? How do you figure? - 'Cause, well, they sent you. - It's true, ash. - Why are you here? - All right, let's go. - Let's move. All right, dietler, you watch our right. Ash, wait on me. Come with me, ma'am. J'j' - Tom shields, deputy site manager. - Lieutenant Harris. We were expecting, not a full-on seal team. - His charter out of Brussels was canceled, and your trouble. He sent me ahead. I'm Zoe Anderson, one of his analysts. - We should get inside. - We're on the clock. - Sure, this way. Poles call this place "czarna wyspa," black island. Used to run military exercises out here. We bought a hundred-year lease from them when they joined NATO, and we got all the shit... - We're the only ones out here? - Just us and our guests. - Who are these guys? - Foreign fighters. You got your common or garden variety Isis insurgents, mostly European jihadists coming back from Syria. Few boko jihadists at the back. These good-looking guys over here, Somalia al-shabab. It's the United Nations of terror. - I thought places like this didn't exist anymore. - We're the last of its kind. Five-star rating on tripadvisor. - What about our guy? - Mansur arrived ten days ago. Turkish police picked him up trying to board a flight to Heathrow using a blacklisted passport. Technically, he requested it. - Transfer him. - You're gonna need a pass. - Over here. You gotta see the boss. J'j' this way. Heads up. He hates surprises, you know? Nobody told us anything about transferring him. - Oh, I'm sorry. This situation's fast-moving. - Strap on, 'cause you just walked into a big measure contest. You're gonna need a whole lot more than "I'm sorry." - Come in. - I'm Zoe Anderson. This is lieutenant Harris. I need immediate access to amin mansur. - Have a seat, Ms. Anderson. - The issue is time-sensitive, so I would really rather... - Sit. I'm assuming you prefer to stand, lieutenant. How long have you been with the agency, Ms. Anderson? - Three years. - Then you should know better than to burst into my office and start making demands. - Well, I didn't mean any disrespect. I have the paperwork for mansur here. - Why the sudden interest? - Mansur's name is on a wire transfer from a known isil financier. - So you want us to question him about funding sources. - No, sir. I'm here to take him stateside. - Why? - I'm afraid that's classified. - I'm just the escort. - Just the escort. Do you know what we do here, Ms. Anderson? We sort and sift. It's ourjob to process foreign fighters before they make it back to the world. If we do ourjob correctly, no one notices, but if we screw up and one of these guys hurts the homeland, it's all over CNN. - I understand your concern. - The detainees that come here do not depart until we've properly vetted them. Now, if you want answers, I will get them for you, but mansur is not leaving this facility. - We are dealing with an imminent threat here. Deputy director Finch signed the request himself. - If you told Henry "gullible" was written on the ceiling, he'd look up. I'm gonna make some calls. - All due respect, we don't really have... - Shields. Give her some face time with her boy while I sort this mess out. J'j' - Don't take it personal. He's been mad as hell all week. First, he quit smoking, then he got word D.C.'s shutting us down. - Really? Why is that? Run out of bad guys already? - New president, new priority. Two words. Domestic terror. Yorke's been in charge of this place since it opened. His wife was in the north tower when it collapsed. He's been running on hate ever since. - Judging by your guests, looks like he's not the only one. - Over here. - Stay the fuck still. - Walk. Stop. Down. - This way. He's been in here a while. I don't know how much sense he's gonna make. Put these on. You sure you can handle this? J'j' Lights on. Hey, sleeping beauty. Wake him up. - Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, stop! - That's enough. - Stop, please! Please... - Untie him, please. - Excuse me? - I need him untied. - Untie him. Pretty lady here to see you. Be nice. - No, please. Please, no. - Please. No, no, no, please, please. No, please. Please, please. No, please. - Hey, I'm not here to hurt you. - I'm not here to hurt you. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Okay, just... Are you amin mansur? - I've already told you people everything I know. - I'm not with these people. Let him go. Tell your men to let him go, please - let him go. - My name is Zoe Anderson. I need you to answer some questions for me, okay? Is your name amin mansur? - Yes. - Good. - There's been a terrible mistake. I'm just a businessman. I haven't done anything wrong. - Your company sells medical scanners, right? - Yes. - Okay. - Please help me; Get me out of this place, please. Please, please. - That's what we're trying to do. - Okay. - You ever visited america? - No. Well, would you like to? I could fly you to New York. - Well, I don't under... - Boston? - I'm not the person you are looking for. - How about Washington, D.C.? The Lincoln memorial is really nice this time of year. - I want my lawyer. I want my rights. I am a British citizen, for god's sake. - Home office revoked your citizenship last night. You don't have a country anymore. - No, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait, please. Wait! Ah! No! No! No! - You shouldn't have got that close to him. You know about death, don't ya? - Well, I am an analyst, not a soldier, okay? I'm not even supposed to be here. - Nothing wrong with being scared, okay? It's what you do with the fear that really counts. - And they teach you that in seal school? - Yeah, second thing you learn right after how to swim. - — Are you kidding? - No, I'm not. Am I, ash? - Yeah, he doesn't joke. - He neverjokes. - Jesus Christ. - I take it you're not a fan of yorke's methods. - You torture someone long and hard enough, they'll tell you whatever they think you wanna hear. All you get is bad intel. And most times, you can learn more with a plate of hot food and pack of cigarettes. - I thought you said you were just an analyst. Sounds like a field operative to me. - I do psych evaluation. - Oh, yeah? - I get inside people's heads, work out what they want. You know what someone wants, it gives you leverage. - And what exactly do you think this guy knows? Because me and the boys kind of feel like we've been left out of the intel. You know what I'm saying? - You remember how we missed the chance to stop 9/11? We're here to make sure that that doesn't happen again. - You can go back inside now. He's a bit more compliant. I'm gonna check what's happening with your transfer request. Play nice, okay? - We do not have time for this bureaucratic bullshit. Next time I come out, he will be with me, okay? - Hey, my job is to escort you and the detainee. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. J'j' - you buy all that? - I don't know. - If you ask me, that guy in there knows Jack shit. He's just a desk jockey bookie. - Come on. - Doesn't matter. We got our orders, right? - And the paperwork? - Well, that's on her and not us. She comes out and says the guy's good to go, then we assume it's all been squared away, right? That's somebody else's otherwise. - Your call, but I still don't think he's who she says he is. - I don't give a fuck if he's the second coming. Yo, we need to wrap this shit up, man. I wanna get home and see my daughter. - So what is the game plan? - As soon as she comes out with the detainee, we fuck off back to, crack open a couple of cold ones, and Skype the kids before bedtime. How about that? - Simple. I like it. - It's because it reminds you of you. - Hey, bro, I ain't got no self-esteem issues. Unlike your whisky tango ass, I got a mom who loves me. - All right, let's pack it up. - We all that. - I fucking hate y'all, and I fucking hate escort missions, man. - Come with me. Move. - Thought we were on an island - supply truck coming by boat to the mainland. - How many passengers? - One driver, one passenger. - It's due in right now? - Wasn't in the briefing. Something's not right. Dietler, hold position. - Ash, whit, on me. - Copy that. Let's check it out. - Sir, can you please stop the engine? - Somebody copy, for fuck's sake. Move up. Move up. - What's going on? Get those guys out of the cab. Get them both out now. - Out of the fucking truck. - Get him out of the truck... - Get out of the fucking truck! Kill the engine. Get the driver out now. Tell him you will shoot him if he doesn't get out. [Gunshofl damnn! Fire! - Sergeant, check the back of the fucking truck. - Check the back of that truck, sergeant! - Move! - Is it clear? - Grenade! Let's go. Go, go, go, go. - Let's take the fight to them! - Stay on mission! - We're good to go! Wheels up? Negative. We need to free it up. - Copy that. On the right! Grenade! - About fucking time. - Hold your position! - Hold your position! Okay, get ready for extraction! Ash, you first! Move! Move it! - Jake, move! - Ash, move! - Move! - I think they're here for him. - Take his hood off. He needs to see where he's going. Changing! - We're going for the helo. - You stay on me. You stay low. You ready? No! - And drop them! - Dietler, you good? - Yeah, fuckin' amazing. - You good? Are you hit? - Are you wounded? - I'm okay. I'm okay. - Operations is closest. - Okay, keep holding him. - Yeah. - Ready to move. Stay with me. - Can you untie me, please? - No! - Move, move, move! - Free the prisoner. - Give them weapons. You two, that way. - They're pulling back. - Whit, you're first. Covering fire. Move! Ash, move! You okay? You okay? You okay? - Could be better. - Move! Let's go. - Go, go! Cover us! Get him out of here, Danny! - Look at me. On three. - One, two, three. - Anderson, you too. Go now. Go! - Go, go, go! - They breached the camp! - Hey, don't go that way! - Not that way! - No! No! - Seals! It's me. - Comms. We need comms. - This way, quickly. - Clear. - Clear. - I got you. - Clear. - I got you. - No exits. - Outstanding. - Yeah, but it's impregnable. Solid walls. No one's getting in. - Nobody's getting out either. - Real good, buddy. - You're doing real good. Need you to hold his wound. Hold him back. - Let me up... Stay there, stay there. - Stay there. You let us... - Okay. - Okay, he's gonna... - Up, up, up. Ah! - Can you find entry? - Can you get to it? - Yeah. - You done it? - Okay, buddy, we got you. - We got you, buddy. You're doing great. Never look back. - I got the pressure. - I got it. I got it. - Okay. - Doing real well, buddy. - Fucking good. We got you. - We got you. You're good. You're good. - I think his lung is punctured. - I know. - Yeah. We got you, ash. Keep looking at me. That's it. - We stopped the bleeding. - You did good, ash. You did good. - How are we doing, whit? - Secure. - Good. Concentrate on me. Look at me. I got you, bud. I got you. - Some fuckin' grub tonight, right? - We got you, buddy. We got you. Okay, ash. Understand? That's it. That's it. We got you. You know we're here, bro. We got you, bro. - Fuck! Fuck! - Harris, hold him. Move, man. - All right, we're digging in. - We're digging in. Whit, I need you in the corridor. You gotta lock that shit down tight, okay? Danny, help me get ash in the other room. Get that fucking door open. Get on the radio. Make the call. - Get him up. Get him up. Myro, this is Phoenix. Phoenix calling myro. Come in. Myro, this is Phoenix. Phoenix calling myro. - Come in. - Slow down. - Myro, this is Phoenix. - Phoenix calling myro. Come in. I can't get anything. - Why? Is it broken? - Jammed. I don't know. - My cell's not working. No cell reception... - Sat phone. - What about a sat phone? - There's one in yorke's office. - Yorke's office? - Fuck. That's too far. - Oh, my god. They're letting all the detainees lose. J'j' - that's yorke. They've already overrun the base. Shit. They're coming for us. Man, they're gonna come in here. They're gonna kill us all. This is another Benghazi. - Who's this guy? - You know that guy? - Hakim shariff. - French-Algerian by birth. Mercenary for hire. Master of persuasion. He led a team of foreign jihadists in Syria. Our intel said he died in an air strike outside nine months ago. - Well, he looks pretty fucking alive to me, lady. - Fuck. - They here for him? I need to know what we're dealing with here. Are they here for him? - British intelligence flagged him up as a low-level is sympathizer a while back. - That is not true. - He was radicalized when his son died during a us. Drone strike while visiting family in Turkey. Two weeks ago, a known isil financier was killed in an rta in Ankara. Local police recovered his laptop from the scene. They sent it to us. We decrypted it - and found a bunch of manifests. - That is not true. - Shut up! Shut up! - Manifest for what? - Shipping containers connected to his company. So he exports things. Doesn't exactly make him a mastermind terrorist. - The business he runs decommissions medical equipment, cat scanners, things like that. - Nuclear isotopes. Is that what we're dealing with here? Nuclear? - Everything we export is regulated by the fda. I'm telling you. - Hey, whit! I need a fallback position right here. Take this. There's more tangos coming. - We have been receiving intelligence that a cell in Europe has been trying to build a dirty bomb over the last year. - What? - Working theory is they are using radioactive material from hospital scanners. We have a paper trail for a shipping container that went stateside via the Netherlands. We traced it to DC. Before the trail went cold. - This is some grade-a bullshit. - NSA picked up chatter around the state of the union address tomorrow night. And if a dirty bomb goes off in the capitol, it will bring all three branches of government to their knees. - You're wrong. Our guys caught his ass with a flashlight. He's nobody. - Well, it doesn't matter if you believe me or not. - Look, this is all just a big mistake. I am a businessman. I don't know these people. I don't know anything about bombs. - I told you to shut your fucking mouth! - He knows where the bomb is, but we are running out of time. He is our one shot to fix this thing. - What? - And if he doesn't know shit then we're risking our lives for nothing. Your men sign up for that? - How certain are you about this? - We have been tracking him for three months. I did his psych profile myself. - Well, if you did it, for sure. - Okay. All right. - Seriously? You're gonna base your decision on a hunch? - My orders are to get him out of here alive, okay? Not in a fucking body bag. Only thing I need you to do is get the comms back online. Sooner you can do that, sooner we can all get the fuck out of here. What are you doing? What are you doing? - He is the high-profile target, not me, okay? Wait. Just wait. I'll do it. If you try anything, I swear to god... You'll regret it. - She's wrong, you know. I'm not who she says I am. I'm telling you she's wrong. - He does anything out of line, you shoot him. - A few down here. - They go up around the corner there. Ten, maybe five. - They're gonna come after us sooner or later. Grenades. Rpgs. We're exposed here. - Just gotta keep 'em suppressed. We ain't losing any more people here today. - We got comms? - Negative. We're trying. - Bad juju on this one. Wrong intel, comms down, ash gone. I'm telling you, man, someone's sticking needles in voodoo dolls made of us. - Don't start getting superstitious on us. - Copy that. - We got our lucky charms then. - Oh, yeah. Mk—12. - Never leave home without it. - Don't shoot! - Please, don't shoot. They want you to surrender. They'll let you live if you put down your weapons. They're not here for you. - Rules of engagement. - Give him a warning. - Do not take another step forward. This is your only warning. - They want you to put down your weapons! - What the fuck do these guys want? Danny! - Get up. Get up. - How's he doing? - Fuck! - How's he doing? - He's good. - It's just a graze. You see me? - Oh, yeah. - You see me? - Oh, yeah. - How you doing, whit? - I got this. - You focus on Danny. Up in heaven, St. Peter gonna say, "how you earn your living? How you aim to pay?" I reply before my god, "I earn my living." Grenade! - Get up! Move! - Harris. - Yeah. - They shot me in the fucking head. - Yeah. You know what? You got a big fucking head, buddy. - Oh, fuck! I can't see, dude. - You can't see? You got blood in your eye, okay? You got blood in your eye. - Don't these guys know when to quit? - Hey, hey. Hey. - You're still in the fight. You're still in the fight. Let's go. You fucking frog man. Let's go. - We're running low on ammo. - I know. - Can't hold here forever, man, not like this. - I know. - Hey, I'm gonna need you to come up with a new plan. You're not gonna be able to hold this line. - Get back inside! - Get away from the doorway. - Lieutenant, I'm gonna give him up. I'm gonna give him up right now. - Fuck. - No, you're not. - Get out of the way. - We're not giving him to them. - The only thing I care about right now is staying alive. If they want him, then let them have him. - You are scared. We all are. - Okay, right, I'm scared. Those guys took out everyone. All the marines, all the pmcs. Next, they're gonna come in here, they're gonna take us down too, and there's nothing these seals can do to stop them. You understand that, right? - Hey, my men can hold them. - For how long? We give him give up. We save ourselves. - That is not happening. - Look, I need him. - I am telling you I am not a terrorist. Please, please. - Listen to me. What if he dies before you can get him out? The whole base is under attack. No one's gonna ask any questions if he gets hit in the crossfire. We throw his body out there. Maybe they'll pack up and go home. - Calm down. - I am calm. I am calm! Listen, one bullet and this is all over, clean and easy. - Sometimes it is harder to save a life than it is to take one. - What the fuck is that supposed to mean? - Shields, just calm down, okay? Calm down. Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Shields. - Listen to me. Listen to me. - He is the problem. We throw him out there. This all goes away. - I have orders to get the hbt out of here alive! - Listen... listen to me! - Put the fucking gun down now! - My son, my son, my son! They killed my son. They killed my son. He was just five years old when he was murdered. We were at a wedding at my uncle's house when an American missile hit. You send your drones around the world killing indiscriminately, and you say I'm the terrorist? Have you ever lost a child? Have you? What about you? When I returned home, an imam I had never met before came to my house. He told me he'd heard about my son. He asked me to help some people that he knew. - What people? - Radicals. They wanted to use my company to launder money for them. - And you let them? - Yes, I did. I was grieving and angry. I'm sorry. That is all I did. I am not a terrorist. Please. - You know where the bomb is. No, I don't. Please believe me. - He's lying. - That's the base intercom. - Who's out there? - I'm here, sir, running operations. They've got us surrounded. - How many of you are there? - Five, plus mansur. You manage to call in support? - Negative. Sat phone's busted. The only thing working is the base Internet. They must be jamming the comms. We can't hold much longer. Someone needs to get to the ra. - The ra? Where is it? - Does it work? - If we can recalibrate it, we can call in support. I'm going... damn it, sergeant! Hold your position! - Sir. Sir. Sir? Sir, are you okay, sir? J'j' he won't go down without a fight. - Hey, tell me about the ra. - Where is it? - It's here. - It's here? We're here. - Yeah. - Can you get there alone? - I gotta try, right? There's no way off this island without help, and... He's right. We stay here, we're gonna be overrun, just like yorke. - And if you don't make it? - I'll make it, okay? All right, tell me what I gotta do. Tell me what I gotta do! - All right, all right. J'j' all right, you're gonna need to recalibrate the race frequency; That's what will let you get past whatever they're using to jam the signal. Take that. - Is there another way out of here? You know, like a back door or a window? - Yeah, yeah. - Over here. Over here. This comes out on the west wall opposite the main cell block. - Okay, guys, change of plan. I need you to hold this down. I'll get extra ammo. - You do what you gotta do. - Hooyah. - You gonna be okay? - It's not just a hunch. He knows. J'j' - Come on, hurry up. Put him out here. Who are you? [Gunshofl - who are you? - Who are you? - Fuck you, you... [Gunshofl Please. - Don't fucking move. - Hey, hey, who are you? - Ben. Ben dolson. I... I handle supply logistics. - Where is mansur? - Who? - Mansur. - Who are you? - Please, please don't kill me. - I have kids. - What do you do here? - Detainee processing. - Do you know the name amin mansur? - Yes. - Where is he? - A seal team came for him. - What did he told them? - I don't know. I swear. I don't have anything to do with interrogations. - Where were they taking him to? J'j' answer my question and I won't kill you. I give you my word. D.C. The paperwork said Washington DC. J'j' No. He's asking me if I'm going to kill you. I told him I gave you my word that I wouldn't. That's true. - Thank you. - He said, "I didn't promise her anything." That is also true. Hey! Go and find me mansur. - I'll go check the gate. Go. J'j' - You! - Fuck you, yasin. J'j' J'j' J'j' -Ahh! J'j' J'j' - Spartan zero one. - This is red hammer zero two. Do you copy? Spartan zero one, do you copy? Whit, I made it to the ra. Get shield. We need to figure out how this shit works. Copy that. - Who's there? Who's in here? Give yourself up. J'j' [gunshofl - no one ever teach you how to calibrate a radio properly, lieutenant? - Anybody else make it out? - No, but I'm gonna make sure none of these fuckers do either. Spartan zero one. This is Phoenix actual. Do you read? - Shield took off. - Whit, that's a negative on shield. Yorke's here. - It's spartan zero one. - Do you read me? Damn it! - They're here for mansur. Heard them talking. - Why do they want him? - Same reason Anderson does. There's a bomb in DC. He's the only lead. - Ah, bullshit. - Well, think about it, man. - Think about it. All these guys are properly trained and equipped, right? Somebody somewhere has been giving them logistical and financial support. You do not do that for nobody. - Phoenix actual, this is spartan zero one. Come in. - Reading you, spartan zero one. This is Phoenix actual. We are under attack by multiple insurgents. Perimeter breach. We need immediate air support. - Copy that, Phoenix. - Minutes out. Please consolidate hard cover. Try to maintain calm. - Stay on the radio. I'll lead them away. As soon as you're done here, you get the comms room's vent on the west wall. - Watch your six. - You too. Over. - We will be moving to our hard cover. Comms will be unavailable. - Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. - Is it mansur? - It is a soldier. Find him. - Mansur. Mansur. - I don't think he's here. - Keep looking. You two, go back that way. Check radio. - Well? - Nothing. - Maybe he's got mansur and they're hiding him in the control center. Get ademar. - Ademar, come here. - Come here, young one. You're a true soldier. You remember your lessons? - Yes. - Tell me. - I must listen and obey even if I have to die. - That's good. That's very good. You are cub, and now it's time for you to show your worth as a lion. I was a cub once just like you, and I educated many non-believers - Yes, just like in the book. - Just like in the book. - But we don't only speak through our words, through our actions. I believe, and I'm willing to. - That's good. You have been chosen with the great honor. A lot of our brothers would like to be in your place. You should be proud. Do you understand? - Yes. - You have been given a great responsibility, but your reward will be greater than you can think of. Will say your name. Do you understand? - I am blessed. The reward of the hereafter is the greatest reward of all. Get those men out of the way. - You promise to serve our fight. Swallow it. It's time. Let's go. Move. Secure the exit. I want two men up here and two men. - Everybody move! Move! - Wait. Make sure everything is ready. - Out of my way. - Do not let go until very close. No pain. There's nothing to fear. Go on. - Is there another way in? - Make way. Go on. Make a path. - Okay, stop. Right here. Stop. What are you doing? And you, here. Come on, guys. Focus. Get me and some grenades - You ready now? - Come on. - Oh, fuck I hate flashbangs. - And you can't see shit through the smoke. - Last mag. You know they're gonna charge us, right? - Yeah. - Right down the middle. They're gonna come after us. - Yeah, well, we can handle it. - Yeah, we can handle it. We just got to be ready, because they're gonna come right down the fuckin' middle. - Danny, hold it together. We got this. We gonna get you home to your mama. I'ma get home to Tia. Come on. You with me? - Booyah. - Hey, boys. Daddy's home. - Roger. Jake's back. - Copy that. - He made it. - Air support is 30 minutes out. - 30 minutes? Fuck. - It's gonna be tight. Heard them talking. It's like you said. They are here for him. - Well, maybe it's time to find out what he really knows. - He tells us where that bomb is, we can radio it in. - You had ten days to break him, and you got nothing. That's not gonna change in 30 minutes. - I lost a lot of people today because of this bastard. - And hurting him is not gonna bring them back. - Oh, I don't wanna hurt him. I want to end him, and so do you. I can see it in your eyes. - No! No! - Talk! - I don't know anything about_ - George, this is not the way to get answers. George, this is not the way. - I am tired of your bleeding heart crap. - It is not about what's right. It's about what works, and this is not it. I moved money for them.. No! No! Ahh! - I cannot get answers... - Get back. Stay away from me. - Jeff, listen to me. I need him in DC. To get answers. - Look, that's enough. - Let him go. Let him go. - Harris, Harris, this guy is the reason your buddy's dead. He is the reason for everything. Everything that's happened today. - Grab his head. - No. No. - You ever read the Bible? You ever here about an eye for an eye? No! No! Ahh! - Why are these... - No, look, he is under my custody, and he leaves here alive. - Yeah, you have paperwork that says that? - That's enough.

I haven't seen her in months. That's rubbish. You're lying. - Four months. That's 16 weeks. Look, it's a boy. You see that? They flew them both out to DC. To give you a reason to stop this. They're both in the blast zone. But it's not too late. You can still save them. You just need to tell him where the bomb is. They don't have time to search the whole of DC. You need to help us, please. We need your help. If you go out that gate, your son and your wife are gonna be dead. Do you understand? They're gonna be dead. We need your help. You couldn't save your other son, but now you have a chance to save this one. Please. - It's too late.

You liar. - I knew you were lying. - No, you need to trust me. - I knew it. - You need you to trust me, please. - You're lying. - Everyone I lost here today is on him. I can't let him leave. - Yorke, you're not thinking straight. You're injured. You're not thinking straight. Let me handle this. - No, he's mine. - Look, if you kill, him... If you kill him, he's gonna die believing he's one. Is that what you want? - You have no authority. - It's all lies. My wife isn't even pregnant. She isn't even in Washington. - Yes, she is. - It's too late. - She is. - It's over. Let him have his revenge right now. I'll take mine in DC. - Please, don't do this. - Don't do this. No, put the gun down - stand down, lieutenant. - I can't do that. - It's an order. - I already have my fucking orders, sir. - How do I know? How do I know you're not lying to me? How do I know? — I can prove it to you. As soon as we get to DC. I can prove it to you, but we're running out of time. Amin, we have your wife, and I'm the only chance you have of seeing her again. Please, just give me the gun. It's over. Give me the gun. - I don't know what to believe in. I don't know what to believe in anymore. If you're lying, it'll all be for nothing. You know that. - I'm not lying. I'm not lying. Just... just give me the gun. - My son. - I hope you know what you're doing. - He's our leverage. Can you make it to the yellow? - No, I'll get the next one. Just do what you gotta do to stop this thing. - I'm gonna come back for my team. - Okay, let's go. Move.
