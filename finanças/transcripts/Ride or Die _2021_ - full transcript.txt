- Mandy. You're beautiful inside and out. Any guy should feel lucky to be with you and I'll always be here to beat up the bullies. I'm like your security now. Does that take us beyond besties?

He wouldn't just give it up. - My dad's deployed so much, I convinced him to give me the master bedroom. - It's his house. - So? - You don't see me taking my grandma's bedroom. - She's here all the time. That's not even a good comparison. - No, but I basically take care of everything around here, including her dog. I guess I don't feel entitled enough to take something like that from her. - (sighs) It's less entitlement and more about need. He doesn't need a giant bedroom he never uses. - And I bet that's the argument you made to get what you wanted. - I got it, didn't I? - You always get what you want, brat. - Done! How much longer are you gonna be, Ash? - I don't know, a few minutes. Are we in a rush? - I may have a surprise! - What, a new boyfriend? Seriously, Mandy? - Don't be mad! - I wish you would tell me about this stuff more than, I don't know, minutes before we leave. I guess fill me in now, give me the low down. - His name is Mat! He is so wonderful! And hot. In a take-me-on-a-magic-carpet-ride kind of way. - That is so racist. No wonder you go through so many boyfriends. - Yea, 'cause I'm hot shit. - But then I have to clean up after you. Like, every time. - Whatever, I know you are gonna love Mat! - [Grandmother] Are you girls getting painted up in there again? You better clean it up this time or I will whip your butts so fast your heads will spin! Also, I made cobbler, come get some before you leave. - I love your grandma. ♪ I'll stick with you, I'll ride or die ♪ ♪ Speeding this only makes some tracks ♪ ♪ Promise me we're not coming back ♪ ♪ We're not gonna make it out alive ♪ ♪ I'll stick with you, I'll ride or die ♪ - Hey babe! - Hi babe! Mat, this is Ashley, my best friend. - [Mat] You never told me your friend is so hot. - Babe, don't be weird. - [Mat] Don't worry. You know I only have eyes for you. - [Ashley] So, you picked this place? - Yeah. I heard chicks like paninis. - Hi everyone. Welcome to Ponzi's Paninis. We had inspection last week, we passed! Specials today are the Italian and I think we have some roast beef that's still good. What can I get started for you? - A glass of Moscato for me please. - I'll have one too. And Kal Penn will have? - [Mat] I'll have your finest IPA, and the Italian. - [Waitress] All right, I'll get that right out. - Tell her how you asked me to be your girlfriend! You'll love this! - So, I invited her over, made some popcorn, got some of her favorite Moscato, and we watched one of her favorite movies. I asked her to be my girlfriend. And she said, "Yeah, you can show me a whole new world." - Wow. That's so sweet and romantic. Did she rub your magic lamp after? - No. I think I'm gonna freshen up real quick. Ashley, do you wanna come with me? - No. We are strong, independent women, that don't need to move in herds. - [Mandy] Okay, fine, I'll be back in a sec. - So, Mandy says you've been best friends for a really long time. - Yeah. Mandy's my best friend. And it's my duty as her best friend to make sure you understand that if you hurt her, I'll kill you. - Oh, don't worry, I'll treat her nice. - Yeah, you don't understand, I've done it before. (ominous music) - [Mandy] Hey guys, did you get along? - All right, here are you drinks. The food will be along shortly. Are you really Kal Penn? - Hey! I was drinking that. - I thought maybe you'd like to hold on something else instead. - I do like this better. If that's what you want, I'm fine holding my wine instead. - Come on. I'll take care of you too. - No! Can we just sit here and, I don't know, enjoy each other's company? - I thought you liked this. - I do. - Okay then. - Just not tonight. - Come on. - If I didn't wanna mess around, would you still wanna be with me? - [Mat] Do I really have to answer that? - So you wouldn't? - I don't know. What does this have to do with anything? - It has to do with the fact that I've already told you, I don't want to and you keep pushing me! - I just really want you right now. Is that so wrong? I could get any bitch I wanted. Instead I'm here wasting my time with you. Do you want me? - Yes. - Then show me. (heart beating) - I said stop! (heart beats) (buzzing) - [Ashley] Mandy, what's wrong? - Mat, he hit me! He was drinking and we got in another fight. He got too rough, I kicked him and screamed and got away. All I could think of was running here. I'm so scared Ash! (Mandy sobs) (doorbell rings) - [Mat] Ashley? (gun fires) (girl screams) - Stop it! Just fucking stop it! Hey, look at me! Calm down! And maybe you'll get out of this. How long were you seeing him? - We've been talking for a few months but we only met up for the first time tonight! I swear I didn't know he was your boyfriend! - He wasn't my boyfriend. Did he ever mention a girl named Mandy? - No! - What an asshole. You know, I just saved you a shit ton of heartache. - Who is Mandy? - My best friend. His girlfriend. Or was before I shot him in the face. He beat the shit out of her tonight, I'm guessing before you came over. What's your name? - Lemonade. - [Ashley] What kind of a name is that? - My real name is Adelaide and I, I could never pronounce it right as a kid so Lemonade stuck. - That's unfortunate. - So I, we have a problem. I don't wanna kill you. I can't take a chance of you getting out of here and telling someone what you just saw. So, what kind of a deal do you wanna make? - I don't fucking know. What do you want? - You're definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time. You didn't do anything wrong. You don't deserve this. - Yes, thank you! You're the kind of friend I wish I had back when I was bullied. - You were bullied? I figured you for a pretty girl who floated through high school. - I did not float through high school. Boys started groping me in junior high. I didn't have the guts to really make them stop. When they held my arms back and grabbed me, I'd scream and it got worse. I didn't have anyone to protect me, so I just did what I could. Maybe if I had a friend like you back then, things would have been better for me. Different. - Would do it for anyone I cared for. - Or maybe I went through all this to get here. To meet you. (gun clicks) - Forget my face. That's your deal. - What if I don't want to? - Promise me. (gun fires) (sobs) Fuck! (water splashing) - Hey! I remember you! You were at my restaurant with Kal. - Shit. - Did you just see Kal? - Yeah. Well, no, actually, he got some acting gig and he doesn't know when he'll be back. I was just checking on his house. - That is so weird. He was just home yesterday. And he wasn't packing anything. - How do you know that? - Well, I mean, obviously, I can't see inside his bedroom, but I walk past his house every day on my way to the cafe which is where I'm headed now. I gave up the panini place, and went for a cafe, instead. It's super trendy. - So you saw him earlier? Was anyone with him or? - Yeah his girlfriend was with him. She seemed upset. Also, you seem upset. Do you wanna talk about it? - Yeah, we can talk about it in the car if you want. Where are you headed? - To the cafe. Weren't you listening? - Do you want a ride? Okay, get in. - So, what's bothering you? - Oh, nothing really. Just Kal and Mandy broke up today. - What? Oh my God! That is just awful! - I can tell you're really torn up. - Yeah I know, I'm sorry. Just I'm just really focused on my next goal of achieving a mutual first name basis. - Mutual? - Yeah well, every time I see him, I'm like, "Hi Kal," and he's all like, "Hey, you again." - What is your name? - Betty. - Well, it's nice to meet you, Betty. So, how did you find out where he lives? - [Betty] Oh, well, when Kal closed out the night at Ponzi's, I sorta took a lift or whatever and followed him home. (Betty exhales) - These white bitches... - Turns out, we live in the same neighborhood. Oh, I've been robbed three times already. Every time they steal all of my whipped cream. So now, I take it home and back to work with me. Smart, I know. - You're gonna use that can for customer's drinks? - It was in my mouth, not on it. It's fine. Mm. I'll give you a free drink for giving me a ride. Man, must be a bad one. - What? - [Betty] It must be a bad period. Just finished mine. - Thanks for sharing. - Oh, come on, like, every woman goes through this. I don't understand why we can't just talk about it. Go home, make yourself a nice wine and Midol cocktail and you'll feel better. - Yeah, I'll give that a try. But, Betty, listen to me, you should take some time for yourself. Move on and forget about him. You're really pretty and funny. You'll find someone who wants to know your name the day they meet you. - You really think so? - Yeah, I do. Just take some time out just for you. The right person will come along. - Yeah, I guess I could. You know, I have been falling behind on my crochet White Castle coasters. (Mandy sobbing) - Don't walk out on him now! She kissed him, he didn't kiss her! - [Man On TV] This meant nothing! - [Woman On TV] I can't believe I gave you my virginity! - Here. It took me forever to find a coffee shop that's still open. Do you remember that panini place? It's a coffee shop now. - [Grandmother] Ashley, is that you? You've been gone a long time and your friend has taken over the TV with that movie you girls always watch when she cries! - [Ashley] She's still here, and can hear you, Grandma! I was out getting coffee. - [Grandmother] Okay, well, I made a cobbler while you were gone, go get yourself some. - This is good! I love pumpkin spice lattes! You know you missed the best parts of the movie. Rom-coms give me hope that one day I'll find my true love. - You do realize those movies are not how real love works? - Whatever, it's still romantic. Who doesn't wanna be swept away with some dashing guy? - Stop! I'm not Amy! - With a really hot British accent. Are coffee shops really that gross? Come on. Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah I'm fine. I'm here. I'm here for you. How's your eye? - [Mandy] It's fine, thanks. - Well, what do you wanna do? What will help you forget about that douchebag? Shit! I am so bad at this. (gentle music) - You are terrible at it, but I love you for trying. - Seriously, what girl gene am I missing that I can't do this? How are you done? - Here. Give it to me. Bring your foot over. Oh my God, this looks like a crime scene! Give me the other foot. - You've always been better at nails than me. - Yeah, but that's about it. I feel so useless sometimes. - What are you talking about? You've always been the smart one. I'm stupid. And impulsive. - Yeah you are! Impulsive, that is. Not stupid. Do you remember in eighth grade when Tommy Silva made fun of my hair and then poured milk on it? - Yeah, and I beat him up for it. I had in-school suspension for like a week. - He never made fun of me after that. He didn't wanna get beat up again by a girl. I don't think I've ever thanked you for looking out for me. - Of course, you're my bestie. Ride or die, right? - Oh my God! Do you remember? - (laughs) Jesus, we're ridiculous. - I know, right? - Who started that anyway? - You started it, after... - It got your mind off your mom. Anything to make you laugh. - We both went through a lot. Somehow you got stronger. - We went through different things. We just dealt with it differently. - You never talk about him. - I don't feel like I have to. - Maybe if you did, maybe you could heal. Your dad walked out on you after your mom re-married and left you behind for a new family. Both of your parents bailed on you out of nowhere. - I'm fine. You said yourself, I'm stronger. - No one ends up fine after that. - I said I'm fine. - You know you can tell me anything. - Not everything. - We're best friends. I can tell something is wrong. Have you been thinking about it? It's been almost 10 years since everything happened. - It's not about that. - Okay. I know that I can't force you to do anything. You're like my sister. I'd do anything for you. You know that, right? Okay! This one's done! There's nothing I can do about the other one though. You're gonna have to use nail polish remover and a Q-tip to fix it. (soft music) - And it's my duty as her best friend to make sure you understand, that if you hurt her, I'll kill you. (Ashley panting) Mandy! I do wanna talk! Wake up! I need you! Please wake up! (ominous music) (Ashley gasping) - What if I don't want to? (door creaks) (soft music) (Ashley sobbing) Ashley? Ash? Ashley? - God! You scared me. - Sorry, I was looking for you! Your Grandma made another cobbler. Not that I don't like them, but can I please have real breakfast? - Real breakfast? - Banana pancakes? - You smell like Icy Hot rubbed on a butthole. - You're a butthole. You slay me. You just had a huge fight and break up with Mat and you are already looking for a new boyfriend? I mean, the evidence is still on your face. - I'm just looking! There's a whole lot of fine fish in the sea. - Yeah, but you find hammer sharks, blow fish, and dicks. I'm sure there's a fish somewhere out there called a dick. - I'm googling it. What if I met a catfish? Do you think I could make it on the show? - [Ashley] One can only hope. - Thanks! These look amazing! Wanna run with me to my house so I can get some stuff? - Yeah, that's cool. I haven't been to your house in forever anyways. Your knife, and your fork. - [Mandy] Show off! - Did somebody swipe right? - There is a fish called a slippery dick. (Ashley laughs) Okay, give me a minute to pack up some clothes. Be right back. (soft music) - Did you make this? - Oh, yeah. Gotta be a creative in, like, therapeutic way to deal with losing her. - I just... Ash? How did you deal with your parents leaving? - Bye! Have a good trip! - [Grandmother] Thank you for watching little Pablo for me! I made you a cobbler! I love you, bye! - I am so fucking sick of cobbler. - Love you too, bye! (rhythmic music) - Look, what are you doing? - Just watching TV. (people cheering on TV) - I didn't know you watched old people game shows. - It's the channel that was on. - Look, I'm not good at this. This whole parenting thing was your mother's expertise. Your grandmother is actually going on this trip so that we can get closer before I get a custody. - I feel closer already, Daddy. - You know I hate that. - I know, Paul. - Mom called me Pauly. - [Ashley] I remember. - I miss her. - If you had been around, maybe she'd still be here. - You know, we met in a bar. Every guy there was trying to buy her a drink. She picked mine, a Buttery Nipple. - Ew. - [Paul] Heh, she loved dirty shit like that. Do you remember the joke about the Schnauzer? - It's the only joke you know. - [Paul] Come on, you love that one. - Jesus, Paul. Paul, what? Go sleep it off. - What if I don't want to, huh? - Paul! What is wrong with you? Get off of me! - I've missed you... - Dad, it's me! - We used to have fun... - Stop! I'm not Amy! - Sure you are... - I said stop! (soft music) - My Grandma took me in. My grandma helped me when no one else would, so I haven't had to cope with much. I think you needed this stuff way more than me. - My mom. Your parents. It all happened within the same week. Every time I try to talk about it, you deflect. Mandy. - [Mandy] We used to be so close and now I just feel like you're pushing me away. - I don't know what you want me to tell you, Mandy. I've been with you through all of this stuff with Mat too, just like the others. What do you think is different? - If you don't talk about stuff, it eats you up inside. I don't wanna go crazy thinking about it. At the very least, do this for me. We can make it fun! We can get drinks on the ride back and play truth or dare. - Okay, but I pick the drinks. - Yes! So, I was hoping this would be a night of Moscato, happy tears, singing Spice Girls songs. - Spice Girls still might happen. But this will be way more fun than all that other stuff you mentioned. You know I love this game, and I always choose dare, right? - I know! Which is why tonight we are gonna choose for each other. - What? Oh come on. - It's the only way you won't just do dares all night. But when we complete one, we take a drink. - All right, it's your game, girl. You go first. - I dare you... - Uh-huh? - To hold a flashlight, like you're telling a scary story, but tell me about your happiest childhood memory. - Really? That's kinda lame. - Whatever, you have to do it. ♪ It breaks my heart to say ♪ ♪ This was my friend, it is so dark now ♪ (Mandy laughs) - It was fourth grade and I was sitting on the swings, alone. This little girl with fiery red hair came up to me and said, "Wow! You can swing really high! Wanna see who can swing the highest?" She sat down next to me and we started swinging as hard as we could, trying to go higher and higher. She ended up winning and you know how I hate to lose. So she said to me, "It's okay that you lost. Maybe you'll win next time. Wanna be my friend? My name is Mandy." And I said "Hecks yeah!" At the end of the school day my mom was actually on time to pick me up. She took me out for ice cream, and I told her all about my best friend Mandy! - That's really your happiest memory? - Yeah. You're the first and only real friend I've had. You know that.

I mean, your parents might as well be dead with what happened. - Your parents loved you. Things were great with my mom for a while, but my dad was never around. Fuck them, you know? I wasn't worth it to them, then they're not worth it to me. I think that's the biggest thing you need to understand. I still have my grandma. She's the one who really loved me and cared about me.

Tell me something I don't know about you. - Oh, you'd think I was crazy. - [Ashley] Try me. - Gosh, okay. Even from that first day we met on the playground, I have felt such a strong connection with you. I know this is ridiculous, but if I knew a relationship with a guy wasn't working out, (ominous music) I'd make up reasons I'd have to leave him. You're such a loyal person, I didn't want you to think of me as someone who couldn't commit. - What are you saying? - They weren't all bad. When everything happened with Rich, you helped me get through it. I enjoyed having you around so much more. I had your undivided attention. I got to see you so much more. It made me wanna make up more stories on why I left them. The more I did it, the more I had to make it look more realistic. (laughs) I've done some really weird things to make it look real too. (laughs) Like, like Mat! I gave myself this black eye. I made myself cry before I knocked on your door. I know this is awful of me to lie like that and to do these things to myself. Just don't hate me, because... Because I'm opening up so you can open up. I wanna know what's been going on with you. We have been best friends for so long and I can see something is upsetting you. I know something's upsetting you. You're not saying anything! They were just harmless white lies. (laughs) Well, I mean, not completely harmless. - Get up. Get the fuck up! Get up there. - Why? - You wanted to know what was bothering me? Get up there. - Why are you being like this? What's up there? - Move your ass or I will. Come on!

I'm getting up. - (screams) Are those bodies? - You don't recognize them? - [Mandy] I don't wanna look! - [Ashley] You're the reason they're dead! - I just told you downstairs this started with Rich! I may have lied about stuff. But you are fucking crazy! I don't even wanna know who the other two... - Oh my God. (pants) - I've missed you.

She can't handle it. - [Ashley] I can't handle it. What have I done? (sobs) - Everyone has done something to deserve to die. You were protecting your friend. What has she done for you? Nothing. - She'll turn you in. Protect yourself and kill her. - I don't think I can. - I'll be with you. I know you can. - You've had so much on your shoulders for so long. Let me help you. (Mandy screams) - Good, you're awake. - Please, whatever is wrong, we can fix it! I wasn't thinking! I should have thought about how what I was doing would affect you! How was I supposed to know you would do this? - How was I supposed to know that you were lying about emotionally abusive, physically abusive, cheating and raping boyfriends? From all of the shit you told me, they deserved it! How fucked up is that? - I told you, Rich was true! And Mat, Mat had pictures of another girl! - Yeah, her? They met up after you left. I killed an innocent person! How can you live with that? - I didn't know this would happen! I just wanted my friend around. - I wasn't around? - [Mandy] I would get a new boyfriend, you'd meet them, and then I would never see you! - Why do you think? As far as I knew, you were a magnet for every kind of asshole imaginable! I did this for you! And it was all a lie! - No, it wasn't! I'm sorry. Please let me go.

You convinced me Mandy deserved to die. - How do you feel about Mandy now? - I feel worse, so thanks for that. - [Lemonade] Why? - I wanted her to hear me, and understand what I went through. I feel like she wasn't listening to me. I was just so angry. I poured everything into our friendship and now it's nothing! Somewhere deep down inside she had to have known that I was doing something to protect her from the shit she was telling me! (Ashley coughs) - I took care of the boys and the people that threatened her. I stood up for her. You were right before. What did she ever really do for me? - So she deserved what she got. - No. No, that's not what I'm saying. I hate what she did. I hate that she lied to me. Now I don't know what was true or not. What if she lied about other things? - So do you think she felt guilty for the things that she did? - I guess I'll never know. Took her getting drunk to tell me, so, maybe? - I don't think she did. But you, this is eating you up inside. Formaldehyde is an interesting substance. It irritates your throat like you're having an asthma attack. It also damages your stomach. (Ashley coughs) (Ashley coughs) - You didn't drink enough to really hurt yourself yet. (Mandy coughs) - Hi, I'm here to get you from point A to point B. I am pulling up our destination now. Hi, how are you? - Oh hell no, girl. This picture does not look like no Grudge girl with glasses on. - Do not bleed on my leather seats. - Maybe I should just get another ride. - No, I will take you to the hospital. Just take a water and give me five stars. - Thanks, it took forever to get a ride. And we're not going to the hospital. - You know this actually reminds me of my honeymoon with your mom. - You can distinguish me from her now, can you? - Except she wasn't wearing anything. Do you work out? Is it hot yoga? Because she never had abs. - Get off of me! - That was uncalled for. - You're dead. - No thanks to you. - You remember what you did? - I remember what I tried to do. Big difference. It was a mistake, okay? I'm sorry. - That's not all I'm talking about and that, by the way, is the worst apology I've ever heard. - I still apologized. It's more than most people do. Brownie points to me. - Brownie points? You used to hit me just so that you'd get the chance to talk to mom when she confronted you about my bruises. Does that deserve brownie points? - It toughened you up. - You made me out like a liar. 'She's a clumsy kid, haven't you noticed? By the way, I miss you so much. Please take my pathetic ass back. Well, every time I was on a visitation, you give me some shitty TV dinner, ignore me, and beat me until you were sure I would bruise. You're my dad! - You know I hate that! - You're supposed to protect me! I was afraid of those weekends. Just waiting for you to hit me with that smile on your face, and then you'd tell me, I was your best girl. I almost wanted it, because at the end, you would actually say something nice to me. At least mom finally figured out what you were doing. Do you regret anything now? - I regret the way things ended between me and your mom. - That's not what I'm talking about. Do you regret anything that you did to me? - No. You're my best girl. You are who you are because of me. - You don't get to take credit for me. I'm my own person. - You are exactly like me. You and I, we hurt the ones we love the most. I hurt you because I love you. I tried to give you your parents back. A stable home. - That's not how you love someone. - You want love without pain. You won't find it. - You can't leave. You're too weak. (Ashley coughs) - Yeah, no shit. You did this to me. I think I passed out. I just wanna lay down in bed and hope you go away. (coughs) - [Lemonade] You took their lives. Look at them. - Stop! - Was it worth it? - No! I didn't want Mandy to go through what I went through. All I did was make this worse for myself. I regretted it every day and I can't take it back. I never thought about it until I met you. - What made me so different? - Oh, hi! You're up! (upbeat music) Ooh! We have lots of celebrating to do! - Celebrate what? - Sorry, I've already had a few! - You wanna tell me what's going on? - First, a toast to us. Drink up! - Happy two month anniversary! - What? - So, I know you have some trouble with doing your nails so, I got you this. Do you like it? - This is actually perfect. Thank you. - I'm so glad you like it! - Two months, huh? Sorry, I don't think I got you anything. - Silly, you got me this dress! - I did? I'm sorry, my head feels fuzzy. I don't remember. I don't even think I can stand up right now. - That's okay. I'll come to you. (Ashley coughs) - This is nice. - Yeah? - Yeah. You don't know how much I've needed this. - Needed what? - Not holding back. I've kept almost everyone else at a distance. - Then don't hold back with me. - I don't know what I did to deserve you. I've felt like a part of me was missing ever since my dad died. - You mean when you killed him? You don't have to hide that from me. - I don't mean to. It's just not something I talk about a lot. He was a terrible person and a drunk, but I didn't kill him on purpose. - I'm sure you were scared. - It was a blur. One moment he was on top of me, and the next, he wasn't moving, but I didn't mean to... - Look at me. That doesn't change how I feel about you. That doesn't define you. I'm with you for you, not for what you've done. I'm here for us. Broken or whole, whatever. I'm here for this. This is what I want. You're what I want. - I really don't deserve you. - I know. (laughs) - Can we just stay in this moment forever? - Just enjoy it now. Be in this moment with me. - I am. I finally feel like myself. I'm not worrying about anything else. Being near you makes me feel sane. Is that weird? - Maybe a little since we've only been together for two months. I guess I'm lucky you didn't show up with a U-Haul for a second date. - I wait two months, it's parked out front. - Hey, that's not funny! - I thought it was hilarious! - You know I can revoke your cuddling privileges at any time. - Really? What are you gonna do about it? - This feels kind of familiar. You shot me. I guess happy ever after is over. (Mandy coughs) - Five stars, okay? (Ashley coughs) - Why are you doing this to me? Please stop. I can't keep going back there. - You can only punish yourself for so long. - I did so many things wrong. I don't even know where to start. I hurt everyone I care about. I'm broken. You were the first person I felt any kind of attraction to. The feelings built up and went away as soon as it started. You made everything spin out of control. - Why me? - You were the first person I killed who was undoubtedly innocent. - I'm not that innocent. You've so much on your shoulders for so long. Let me help you. - [Grandmother] Ashley, is that you? Were you talking to someone? I'm not feeling so well, keep it down please. - What are you gonna do about her? - Grandma? Nothing. - She's been turning a blind eye to what you've been doing. She's hurting knowing what you've done and brought into her home. End her suffering. - She's not an animal. What are you suggesting? Putting her down? I would never hurt her. - You already have. She'll never tell you how badly you've hurt her. She suffers in her silence. You can set her free. Let me help you. End her pain. Do it. (Ashley coughs) No one's perfect, Ash. The trick is learning to live with what you've done. No one is innocent, not any more. You're losing your chance to become something better than what you lived through. You've lost your chance for forgiveness. You took away the chance from Paul, Rich, Brad, Dean, Mat, Mandy, and myself to become better than we were. You took away the possibility of what we could have been. And now you can't live with who you are any more. All you can do is accept your guilt and embrace your fate. - I want this to stop. - You can make it stop. - Ashley! - Let me do this, Lemonade. - What? Ashley, it's me! It's Mandy. - Yeah okay, you're dead. - You sound so happy to see I'm alive. - Is it really you? - Yes. I came to get even. But I can see you've already done it to yourself. (Ashley coughs) - Dammit, Ashley! What are you doing? - I'm ending my pain. - This is not the answer. I'm calling for an ambulance. - This is my chance. - For what? - I'm so sorry, Mandy, this is all my fault. Even with you I built up walls, I didn't talk to you about what I was dealing with. Your best friend is fucked up. I'm still fucked up. I became worse than the things that happened to me. You don't need me any more. Please forgive me. - I might be able to forgive you, but nothing will be the same. You did hurt me, Ashley, and there's no taking that back. I can admit I should have paid attention to the things that you needed and I didn't. I lied to you about things no one should lie about. We can't take away what we've done, but maybe we can move past it. I'm here now, okay? But first, Ash, I'm calling an ambulance. Hi, I'm at Motel 75. My friend is dying, I think she, oh god! No! (sobs) No! I think she's stopped breathing. (sobs) - [Ashley] Mandy. I'm sitting in English pretending to write in my daily journal right now. This class sucks and Ms. Thompson is an uptight bitch. Writing to you is so much better. I can't wait to come over this weekend and sleep over. What shenanigans will we get into while your parents are away? Who am I kidding? It's going to be pizza, makeovers, and finding the booze. You know, the more I think about it I might just beat up Tommy Silva for being a jerk. Don't let him make you feel like there's anything wrong with you. You're beautiful, inside and out. And any guy should feel lucky to be with you. And I'll always be here to beat up the bullies. I'm like your security now. Does that take us beyond besties? I think it does. Later, Ash.
