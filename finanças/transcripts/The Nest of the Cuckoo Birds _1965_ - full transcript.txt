Lieutenant Johnson, beverage department - Brother, how are you? - Hi. We've been expecting you, won't you come in? Thanks. - Well, you ready for your trip? - Yeah. Johnson. I've told Lieutenant Dreyer here from the Florida beverage department that I feel under these circumstances you're the only man we have really qualified for this assignement. Well, thanks for the road. You were brought up with these type of people. Daddy ran a still, didn't he? Got killed by this kind, ain't that right? Yeah. Hear you've been harbourin' a vendetta - A vendetta? - It's true isn't it? A vendetta? Well, well not exactly. Look. I'm not against it. In fact the more prejudice in these circumstances, the safer. They're mean! Just about the lowest type of criminal there is. You gotta be careful. Have you ever seen the mosquitos in the glade? They're like dive bombers. They start from the top, zzzz Man you better watch out, because they got the longest, pointiest dinger you ever saw. Then there's the gators. And the snakes. You know, sometimes I feel more than most men. What am I telling you all this garbage for? The things that I'll regret the most. Is leaving my little, my dear Pat behind. I swear, she's more than most. I don't know why you put up with me. Why do you? I don't know. I ask myself that, too. Then maybe I better not come back. Don't you talk like that. Luke.

You've always wanted his job. Yeah! You want his job! - Don't you Slim? - I'm thinking of you. I stock the operation. Yeah, I want his job. Me? Us? How did he know? How'd in hell did Mark know? He said-he said he recognised him. But he couldn't- he couldn't place him. That's a laugh. I didn't buy that. - I don't see no laugh. - I called him! A month or so ago. We gonna do Johnson's pants. He said he was goin' to wash 'em. Yeah, I bet he knew then. And I bet he wasn't going to wash 'em. Steal? Now why'd he tell Johnson? Look! I'm no fink. Why should I? I didn't care.

You let a cop get away, will you? You skunk! Slim? You take this punk out to wail, and bring him to. Go get Mark, I want that skunk with us! Get up we gotta drag over here. Toward that way. - Behind, is really my only regret. Not being able to touch her, having her near me, the warmth of her. Her tenderness. Yes, her kisses. That's the thing I'll regret the most. That wild little sparkle she gets in her eyes when I look at other girls. Y'know, new years Eve everybody, well they were just kissing everybody else. And this cute little blonde, well she, she come up to me and she planted the biggest, big kiss, well, you oughta seen Pat, ha! Ooh, that little wildcat, she almost tore 'em apart. That's the thing I'll regret most of all. My name's Harold. Can't remember when we've had a guest at this hotel. A long time. Come to think of it, I'm gonna have to sign you in. That is, if you're going to stay here. You are going to stay here aren't you? Looks to me like you'll have to. It's the law y'know sign in at the hotel your staying at, I mean. Here, this'll make you feel better. I brought your breakfast. It's getting cold! Eat it all. I don't want to see a single thing left on your plate. Yes, Mom. I'll send Harold in for the dirty dishes. I don't think I could stand seeing you again tonight. I'm Mrs Pratt. You are our guest here, and I want you to remember this. That is, as long as I allow you to stay on. Is that understood? Is that understood! Yes, yes ma'am. - I was, excuse me. - What is your name? Whatever brought you to this island? And what is your business here? - Where do you come from anyway? - Hey! - I want to know why you are here on this- - Just a minute! Hey wait! Let me answer this first one! Before I forget what it was. Well- my name's Johnson, and I'm a- - well sort of a tourist. - Out here? Oh I know it sounds crazy, but I came here to hunt and fish. - It seems I got lost. - Got lost? That doesn't seem likely or make sense. Well it would if you were me ma'am. Searchin' channel after channel, lookin' for a way out. Rippin' the bottom outta your brand new boat. One you'd saved for. That was a blow! Saved and saved for. And then losing everything else besides. Guns, fishing gear, the whole damn works. Man! Didn't you have a compass? Nobody goes into the glades without a compass! Why are you lying to me? Woman, what would I be lyin' to you for? Of course I had a compass! It slipped overboard. Got a little excited when I was trying to shoot. Shoot-a, a stinking little cat. It was too far away anyhow, shouldn't a tried that. Got over anxious, excited. Shouldn't a tried that. What do you want outta me? Alright- alright, I'll accept that explanation. For now. Accept it, for now? What would I be lyin' to you for? I mean, look- look at the help you've given me. You've done me a favour. I wanna be friends, lady. Y'know, you're an attractive woman. You look, a little like my sister. Oh, could you imagine a hillbilly becoming an actress? Well that's just what she is. Eight months of grammar school. And works all the time, seems to be just what they wanted. Some people seem to have all the luck without even half tryin'. Works all the time. Well of course, she doesn't have big parts yet. But works all the time. It's excitin'. I used to be in show business. That's how I met my first husband. Yeah, I could see you must have been something, real special in your day ma'am. The belle of the ball, I'd say. Oh you would! You must pray young man! You must pray! We have a chapel here! And even our guests must pray! Hi! Can I give you a hand with that? I'm pretty good with that kinda stuff. Thanks, just about have it fixed. How do you feel? Like a new man. Sure I can't help you with that? No! As I said, its fixed! - Ok! - I like it right there. - Ok. - You didn't eat your sandwich. Guess not. Though I could eat a horse now. Took the others their dinner a while back. Oh, by the way, thanks for taking me up to bed. Is there any food left? Well I couldn't have you sleeping down here. You'd have stunk up the place. You're a pretty strong guy for a little fella. Carrying me up all those stairs. - What did ya say about dinner? - Took the others up theirs. - Others? Others? - Come on I'll take you to the kitchen. Random man, that's me. Never knew canned food could taste so good! Yeah, I better clean these up. Must be a million bugs around here, given half a chance. Mrs Pratt tells me you're lost, that your name is Johnson? Yes, she told you right. Say- is there anyone living here aside from Mrs Pratt? - You said others. - No! Well she- she has a daugther. Look, Mrs Pratt doesn't like meddlers. Sorry, I- I don't want to annoy anyone, y'know? Do you mind if I ask you, one more question? Is there- or are there, any buildings on this island? And you know, where people are living? - I mean- - no! We're set off from the outside world here. Look! You'll know that I don't like people who ask questions! I'm not buggin' you, and you been nice to me. I'll make you a deal, no more questions, ok? I think I'll just- go out for a while and keep myself- Wait! Wait! - You don't mind if I go out now, do you? - Most certainly not! But- but I must warn you to not stray too far from the hotel. Why's that? Sorry! It's Mrs Pratt's wish! Mrs Pratt also wishes for you to refrain from going to the rear areas of the hotel. When in the hotel, or on the grounds. She's very strict about that. Keeps her most valuable posessions there. Nothing really worth a lot. But dear to her, for sentimental reasons. She probably told you about her first husband? - Yeah, said, said he died. - Well then you'll understand. Well there's a lot around here I don't understand. Well then it's none of your business. And please, Mr Johnson, what you do not understand is our personal business. So please don't try to understand. Yes, not nice. Well of course, you're the boss, Harold. Help! Get down your hands and knees and pray! Pray you enough? You pray that your sins will be cleansed! I am, Momma, I am. - And pray more, more! You hear me! - I am! What are you doing? What were you doing down there on the floor Mr Johnson? Oh, don't be alarmed Mrs Pratt. I heard somebody screamin' I got, I got worried, real worried. No need to be. I thought maybe, maybe you'd fell down or something. Hurt y'self or something? Just wanted to help. Just was makin' sure there was a problem first. There is a problem. You heard, my, my half mad daughter. But that is my problem and not yours. And I don't need, nor do I wish, any help, or interference! Half mad? - Crazy? - Yes! And you can help by not paying any attention to the screams or her carryings on. We lock her up for her own protection, as well as ours. Violent? I understand. It's very well that you know what's best. It figures. Can be kinda dangerous, huh? Oh, Harold's reason for being here now seems pretty important to me. A necessity! I wouldn't want anybody tellin' me how to take care of mine. I'm glad we agree. Do you have a child? No I, I'm not even married. I mean if I did, don't worry, I won't interfere or make an ass outta myself All men are asses. I wouldn't go so far as to say that! Is she pretty, your daughter? Yes, poor thing. Shocked out of her ever-loving mind. A terrible day when her step-father attacked and beat her. - Step-father? - I was married twice, don't count the second one though that rotten man attacked and beat her. Because of his passion. Because of his evil passion! The beast. The beast! And he's still repenting for his sins! Her too. Poor thing. God must be punishing her too. I understand. Yeah, I understand. Join me, for a cup of tea. Sounds great. Shall I lead the way? You've got the light. Is everything alright, Mrs Pratt? Yes, Harold, shouldn't it be? Well, I thought that, No, Mr Johnson and I are getting along famously. Did you know his sister is in show business? - Hey that's right! - No, I didn't. - That's nice. - Mr Johnson and I are going to have tea. Oh, and by the way Harold, I'm going to invite Mr Johnson to join us for prayer in the chapel Sunday. So will you please prepare a chair for him? It'll be so nice having you there Mr Johnson. Boy that Harold. In a sense, Harold is only half a man. Due to his mother's over protection. Which inwardly makes him rebel, and hate most females. Especially those who wanting to be close to him. Yeah, I got that impression. Yes, I seemed to get that impression. He thinks he has a complete understanding of women. Placing them in the category of: Wild, unpredictable, dangerous, even crazy Hell, he's got a point. Have to go along with him on that. Somehow though, I think I like him better this way. Because not only is he harmless, but useful and dependable as well. Yeah, he seems that, heh. But a man who makes no passes can be awfully dull. Not to me, I've had my fill of that kind of trash. Well, to each his own. So, under the circumstances, I have to go along with you on that. Well I'm glad you do! You'll have to excuse me, I'm very tired. And I think I'll go to bed. Sure, you do that, and have a nice rest. I think I'll just stay around here for a while, if you don't mind? - Thanks for the tea. - Good night! ♪ In the nest of the cuckoo bird inn ♪ ♪ sits a fair old maiden, ♪ ♪ her soul had elated, she waits alone, ♪ ♪ in the cuckoo bird inn ♪ ♪ here's a quest that you'll never forget ♪ ♪ for it's mystic magic, ♪ ♪ you'll find somewhat tragic ♪ ♪ this mystery, ♪ ♪ of the cuckoo bird inn ♪ ♪ come away with me, come away. ♪ ♪ To the nest of the cuckoo bird, ♪ ♪ where there was never heard laughing, singing ♪ ♪ in the cuckoo bird inn. ♪ ♪ In the nest of the cuckoo bird inn ♪ ♪ would you dare take a chance with me, ♪ ♪ share a romance with me, ♪ ♪ just we two, in the cuckoo bird inn. ♪ My goodness!

What in hell is going on here? Now look man, you have no reason to treat me like this. Or do you? Forget it. I'm sorry. Forget it, I made a mistake, I'm sorry. Goodness gracious me! Whatever brought that on? I didn't dirty you up. I said I was sorry, so forget it! I didn't dirty you up! Forget it! Who's there? Harold? I've explained to you Mrs Pratt, several times after all, that gentleman has stayed here for several days. You've gotta help me out and explain what to do. After all, Mrs Pratt I tried to tell you! Good heavens you, you're so difficult to get along with Mrs Pratt. After all, that man, has come here several days. I'm Lisa. I'm Lisa! Well? Well, hello there. - I'm Johnson. - Hi! Don't feel uncomfortable or anything. - Your name's Johnson, huh? - Yeah. How'd-how'd you get past Mother? I was just careful, that's all. You know that hall's pretty dangerous. I see. Must be one of those low beams. No, I got this before, but I did hit a beam in the same spot! - Say. - Close that door before ma hears. She don't like me talkin' to no strangers. Yeah, you've got a point. It's been years since I've seen, or talked to a-real man. Thanks. Say, your mother, Mrs Pratt, she tells me, she tells me that you're insane? Heavens no! You mean mad, don't you? Mentally. Momma thinks so though - Why? - Not really sure. She seems to think I am, that's why she beats me sometimes. For no reason! You look so lovely when you smile. Don't cry. I could never explain what it's like here. Windows boarded up, I never see daylight, all cooped up. I'm not mad or anything. You've got to believe me. Why don't you wait til the tea is ready? There won't be any left for Mr Johnson. I don't see why he has to have any anyhow. At the rate you're going he won't have much choice. So take it easy, save it. - The wa- - Oh my! I think I'll leave his in the pot until he gets down. Keep it hot. Better not let Lisa out any more. These nights, the moon's too full. What with Mr Johnson here and all. Yes you're probably right. I don't see why you let him stay so long. There's something about him, I despise. He seems like, such a misguided young man. Needs to be forgiven! I want him to join us for the chapel. - I can tell he's quite a sinner. - Yes. Yes, he probably is. Well, doesn't that make you happy? - To help him shed those sins? - I guess. Makes you happy. Where is he anyhow, shouldn't he be down here by now? Oh! Harold. You're such an old woman. Always suspecting. Lisa would like to get her hands on him though. When I told her that a stranger was staying here, her eyes lighted up and she got so sick. I had to slap her to her senses! Poor thing. She's so mixed up. God, punishing her. But we must all repent for our sins! Lisa? Tell me about those chains. Do you always wear them? Momma's been keeping me inside during the day. - During the day? - She only lets me out at night. - Free of the chains. - At night? So I wouldn't run away y'see, I'm afraid of the dark. Always have been. She naturally knows that, she don't want me- What, if only I had a chance and knew how to get out of this jungle. I guess I'm stuck here, stuck here for the rest of my life. She only lets you out at night? Sometimes not even then. During the time of the full moon- during the time of the full moon? Oh, that's why your chained up now, huh? I don't know exactly why. For some strange reason she become violently mad at me. Maybe she thinks that, if the moon were real full you wouldn't be too afraid to leave. No, because on many of those nights it would rain. The full moon wouldn't give off it's bright light. She's so mad at me some times. She'd beat me, bite me, kick me. She beat me last night. Look at my bruises. Look! This, this was the case last night? Here - if I would have seen. Really, I don't know who'd believe this. But those scars and bruises, they could have come from running through the woods at night Why that's-- Don't you believe me? Don't you believe me? - I'm going to see what's holding him up. - Sit down, Harold! If he's not down in five minutes I'll let you go after him. - Sit down and finish your tea. - All right if you insist. Some times you upset me, Mrs Pratt. Some times you really upset me. Did your momma take those chains off the night before last? Yes. - Last night too? - Yes. It's funny, after being so mad an all. Look, look I gotta get outta here before- before your momma comes lookin' for me. I'll be back, really, I'll be back. Please help me. Life here's so depressing. Hell on earth. I'll do anything if you only help me. Look, I gotta get outta here, if I'm to be any help to you at all. But I'll be back. I promise I'll try, I'll really try. I promise I'll be back, I'll be back. You are my daughter! My flesh and my blood. I'll take you down to the deep water gator holes and drown the madness out of you. Mayube I could kick it out of you, you man-crazy, man lover! Man-crazy, man lover! Why, why do I have to a cuckoo crazy daughter like you? What can I do to draw the germ from your head? Get up! Get up off that bed! Such a lovely face. So sensitive and so well cut. Why does that have to be? This devil! This mad and vile devil within. Your stepfather though, didn't see it. Just some other men. Lovely! I should have faith! That was his downfall. Yes! Yes! That was his downfall. But he is repenting, repenting, repenting, repenting! His sins were the fault of that face. That beautiful face of yours! I loved him. So much! I loved him so much, so very much. But he loved you! That devil, that mad crazy devil! That killed him, his sinning ways, and your devil. No, Momma, please don't hit me again. You! You snooper! You're gonna die! Doc! Don't be alaramed! Don't get alarmed, no! I'm letting you free! Free! Now listen carefully, this is very important. I don't want anybody to see you. So be very quiet and cautious. Even more than that, - I don't understand. - You, well just trust me. Now you get down to that beach, you know how to get threre don't you? Yes it's a lovely place, I like to go out there. I'm not even afraid there at night. It's the only place I'm not afraid of at night! You mean? You're not afraid of the beach? At night? - How about going there? - Harold brings me. He does? Yes! Harold's been very nice to me considering. Brings me my food, chats with me. He's often mean too, but not like Momma. Girl stop confusing the issue, we're in a hurry. - I just gotta take a chance with you. - What do you mean? - Take a chance with me? - Forget it! Come now, I'll explain it later. We don't have enough time. You best get down to that beach, and you hide in the brush. And Lisa? Whatever you do, don't let anybody see you. Wait for me there, understand? I'll be down later, as soon as possible. There's something else I have to do here first. I'll explain later. Now you won't be able to get that bracelet off until we find a blacksmith. And that won't be for a while yet. Now you just bear with me. I'm free! I'm free. Not yet you're not! You just keep quiet, we don't have enough time, come on. - No! - Hey, hey where you going? This seems faster. And I'll be able to make it easier. Through this door. We've less of a chance of being noticed. Oh, okay. Hey wait a minute. That's for luck. Thanks. Praying? In this dark solitude? Hey fella! Excuse me. Is this a church meeting or something? Hey! Hey listen! No! Ten men! No! No! Don't touch that mask! And raise both hands! Raise those hands I said! Give me that gun, Harold. Give me that gun before you-- you make things worse for you- don't shoot. Give me that gun. No! No, because you're the one in trouble. Yes you! Give me that gun, Harold. Now you give me that gun! Meddled long enough! When I smash you on the head you take a hint! But no. No you had to snoop! Snoop snoop! My life here might have seemed miserable to you I didn't want you to like it. We like it. Wanted it! And kept to ourselves, by ourselves you hear! Our little world. Bothering no one! You mean. You mean people isn't bothering them? Only those that invaded our island. They were all men, like you. Destroyers of the human race. And disrepair to the world. They just kept coming. Invading our privacy! I didn't kill them though. Then who did? She. She did. Loved me. Recipient of unhappiness. The unhappiness donated by men! I loved her. And her body. The peace she brought to me. Generosity, kindness. Tender fulfillment. Being able to give, service and love to her. Do you understand? Do you understand? I mean- she made me feel important. I'm a taxidermist, I don't- I was even able to assist her in her ceremonies here. I must admit, I too didn-- didn't quite understand. She had never- you can understand. That's why she kept herself a prisoner here. And now she's dead! Dead! And you men, dare! You dare destroy her! You dare! She had to kill! She had to kill for preservation. It was her destiny. It's no ones destiny to kill. Now, Harold... you give me that gun before you make things worse for yourself. You give me that gun. No! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa. Lisa, you're alright. Alright Lisa, you're free. You're free, didn't you hear what I said? Yes, I heard. Well, doesn't it make you happy? Look!
