It's not something you can explain (FINGERS SNAP) just like that. -If you can't explain it, it can't mean that much to you. -Well, that's where you're wrong, because it does. Listen, it's just something I've gotta do. If your afraid, then-- then wait here. -I'm afraid for both of us. It's stupid. We could get killed. And for what? So you can be Mr. Big Shot. -Nobody's going to get killed. -Bobby, please. -No, I can't. I mean, how's it going to look? -Who cares how you look? Who's more important to you, those people or me? -Oh, come on. -No, you come on. I've done everything but plead with you. Don't you care how I feel? You don't, do you? -I do. Hey, look. What do you want me to say? -Change your mind. -No. I cant. -Do what you want to. [ENGINE APPROACHING] -Hey! I didn't think you'd show. -Been waiting here 20 minutes. -Can't wait to get beat, huh? -Hey, I'd like to see it happen. -Well, let's do it, my man. [ENGINES START] [ENGINES REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [ENGINE SLOWS ] [ENGINES IDLING] -(LAUGHS) I thought you said that was a hot car you had. -Come off it, man. You know I would have beat you if you didn't cheat. -What do you mean cheat? I beat your ass fair and square. -You ran me off the road and you know I was beating you, too. -Well, come on then. One more time. I'll whip your ass again and no excuses this time! -Stay on your side of the road and there won't be no problem, man! [ENGINE REVS] [TIRES SCREECH] -Bobby, please! -Hey, look.

[INAUDIBLE] [ENGINE FADES] [SIRENS WAILING] [DOORS SLAM] [DOGS BARKING IN THE DISTANCE] [MECHANICAL WHIRRING] [MOANS] MR. LUCARD (OFFSCREEN): I thought you said they were two in the accident. DR.

[HEART BEATING] [HISSING] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] [DOOR CLOSES] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [DOOR CLOSES] MR. LUCARD (OFFSCREEN): You know, we're going to need more bodies. DR.

[SOBBING AND CRYING] -There now. There's really nothing anyone can do any more. She's at peace with herself. [SOBBING] It all came very quickly. She never felt a thing. I was here by her side all the time. She went very peacefully and very quietly. [SOBBING] -But why? -I think it was a stroke. At least for the moment, it has all the signs. These sort of things are hard to detect at first, at least until an autopsy is performed. -No! No! Don't cover her! -Potter! Get out of here! -Sorry, I thought I was called for. -I'll call you when I need you. -I took the liberty of calling in Mr. Lucard. He'll take care of all the necessary arrangements, if that's all right with you. I don't think you should trouble yourself with such things right now. -I'm terribly sorry all this happened, Mrs. Fonda. I also know there's nothing I can say or do that is of much help. But if you will give me permission to handle all the arrangements, I'll do my best to make things as easy as possible for you. -If there are any questions you may have or anything that you need to be taken care of, I'm sure Mr. Lucard will be more than happy to help you. -Mrs. Fonda. Mrs. Fonda! -Oh, Mr. Lucard. I'm sorry. Did you call me? -Yes, because there are a few formalities to be taken care of. We may as well get rid of them now. This is the death certificate. It must be duplicated, but I can take care of that for you. This is the authorization for the removal of the deceased. We need that to begin arrangements. Mrs. Fonda? -Oh, I'm sorry. Where do I sign? -I'm sorry. I know how difficult this must be for you. Take your time. I'll take care of all other amendments, anything that's necessary. Now, if there are any questions or any other way I can be of help to you, please feel free to call upon me. -No. I'm sure everything will be all right. Thank you very much. And I'll have my husband call you as soon as he gets in. -Very good. And, once again, Mrs. Fonda, please convey my sincere condolences to your husband. And, of course, to you. -Thank you. You're very kind. [FOOTSTEPS FADE] [ENGINE APPROACHING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] -Marie? -Oh, Ted! Oh! [SOBBING AND CRYING] -That's it. Let it out. Let it out. You'll feel better. [MARIE CONTINUES SOBBING] I was just thinking about the first time I came here. Boy, did she give me the third degree. -Oh, she did not. -She didn't? She made me sit on the couch while you two sat over by the window. -She was just being formal. She didn't want you to think she was a softy. -Remember how she wouldn't eat those cakes I bought her, just because she knew you told me they were a big weakness? -And as soon as you left, she devoured the whole box. [CHUCKLES] She got sick she ate so many. -I bet she'd blame that on me, too. It seems like every time we came here, she was in this room. She really loved it here. -I know. And since my father died, she spent most of her time in here. She and Daddy used to sit in here on summer nights after I was in bed. I could hear them laughing and talking all night long. -I wish I could have met him. -Oh, you would have gotten along beautifully. -You know, a thought just flashed by me. Well, since this was your mother's favorite place, why not have the wake here? -At home? -I mean right here in this room. She would have liked it that way. This way her friends can say goodbye to her where they knew her best. -Ted, could we? -You want to? -It's exactly what she'd want. -Then we'll do it. -Thank you. What about Mr. Lucard? -I'll call him now and tell him we changed our mind about the arrangements. -He'll be upset. I already told him. -Leave that to me. Mr. Lucard, please. Hello, Mr. Lucard? This is Ted Fonda, Mrs. Bradley's son-in-law. I'm sorry to be calling late, but I wanted to tell you that there's been a change in plans. Yes, Mrs. Fonda and I decided to have her mother's funeral at my mother-in-law's house. -Well, you see, Mr. Fonda, there are laws regulating the handling of the deceased. And since your wife did authorize us to prepare the deceased for the funeral, legally, therefore, we are responsible. Oh, of course, Mr. Fonda it will be all right with you, but unfortunately, state laws look on this sort of thing rather harshly. Mrs. Bradley must be embalmed and prepared for the wake. There are strict guidelines for such procedures. Besides, Mr. Fonda, have you really considered the effect that having the deceased at home would have, especially on Mrs. Fonda? Oh, yes, Mr. Fonda. Of course you know what you're doing. I-- I didn't mean it that way. Yes, Mr. Fonda. I'm afraid it's a great deal more complicated than that. -Ted, is something wrong? It-- it's nothing, honey. It's just a technical problem. All right, then. I'll see you in the morning. Very good. Goodbye. [PHONE RATTLES IN CRADLE] No problem. He's just being a businessman, that's all. -Why? What did he say? -Just some mumbo jumbo about the law forbidding it. -Well, maybe he's right. -He's not right. It's done all the time. He just wants to make a little money. I'll go down in the morning and straighten it all out. In the meantime, I'll make a few phone calls and start making arrangements. Why don't you go and get some sleep. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow. -I am a little tired. -A little tired? You look exhausted. Go on up to bed now. I'll be up in a little while. [FOOTSTEPS ASCEND THE STAIRS] [HEART BEATING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] -May I help you, sir? -Where's Mr. Lucard? -Mr. Lucard is not in this morning. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Sir, if you wait just a moment, I'm sure Mr. Lucard will be back here to explain everything to you. -I told Mr. Lucard I'd be here this morning for my mother-in-law's body. -Mr. Lucard did not say anything to me, sir. -I hired this man. I'm not going to wait around for Lucard. Tell me where Mrs. Bradley's body is. -Mrs. Bradley's body cannot be taken from here without Mr. Lucard's permission, sir. -If I have to go through here room by room, I will. -Sir, you can't do that. -I will if I have to. -Sir, this is highly irregular. Mrs. Bradley is down the hall, sir. -Very good. Please tell Mr. Lucard to bill me for the casket and his services. We'll manage from here, thank you. -Yes, sir. [DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINE ACCELERATES] -A weird bunch there. This guy Lucard is a real dictator from what I hear. -I don't know. Maybe he's just a little too bureaucratic. -Nah, he's always getting in hot water for pulling shady deals. -Shady deals? What do you mean? -Yeah. You know, unauthorized removal of accident victims, missing persons. Things like that. -I didn't know. -Oh, yeah. This guy would do anything for a client. This thing with your mother-in-law? Weird. -In what way? -Well, you said she died at home, right? -She did. -That's what I mean. What's he doing with her? -My wife authorized him to remove the body before we decided to have the wake at home. -But your wife can't authorize anything in this case. See, when a person dies at home, the body goes to the county coroner, they examine the body and determine the cause of death. -Her family doctor signed a death certificate. -Well, I don't know. It seems weird to me. And why would they give you a hard time about taking the body? -Who knows? Maybe he just wants to make some money. -Well, looks like he's going to make some money either way, you know what I mean? [LATCHES OPEN] If there's anything else I can help you with? -No, thank you. You've been very helpful. Believe me, we appreciate it. -Yes. Thank you so much. -It's quite all right, ma'am. Would you like me to close it? -No. That's fine. -Well, I better be going then. I'm sure you have a lot on your minds. TED (OFFSCREEN): Marie? What are you doing? -Nothing, Ted. -Come on. I think we better start making some phone calls. -Mr. Fonda? TED FONDA (OFFSCREEN): Yes. -May I come in? My name is Lucard. We spoke together yesterday on the telephone. TED FONDA (OFFSCREEN): What can I do for you, Mr. Lucard. -Well, Mr. Fonda, I really don't know how to begin. I find it all very embarrassing. -I'm afraid I don't quite understand. -Well, my assistant made a terrible mistake this morning by releasing Mrs. Bradley's body to you. I've come to take her back to the funeral home. -That's impossible. -Why? -Because I won't have it, that's why. -Well, Mr. Fonda, it's not really your decision to make. The law requires that I complete embalming procedures. I could have her back here by tomorrow-- -She's staying here, Mr. Lucard. If you want to do your work here, please do. -Here? It's impossible to do it here. -Then, I guess it won't be done. -I don't want to make this a legal matter, Mr. Fonda, but there are laws, and if I find it necessary, I will do so. -Ted, what's wrong? -Good morning, Mrs. Fonda. -Mr. Lucard. Ted? -It's nothing, honey. We're just clearing up a misunderstanding. -Perhaps, Mr. Fonda, we could continue this conversation at my office. -I don't see why that would be necessary. I think enough has been said. We both understand. -Mrs. Fonda, I came to take your mother back to the funeral home. I've- -That'll be quite enough Mr. Lucard. -Very well. I'm afraid you give me no alternative but to take legal action. I'm sorry, Mrs. Fonda. -When you return with legal authorization, we'll talk, Mr. Lucard. Until then-- -Very good, Mr. Fonda. Mrs. Fonda. Good day. -Ted, maybe he's right. -If he is, he'll bring papers with him. In the meantime, I don't trust him. -What do you mean? -Well, nothing really. Just something that driver said to me on the way home. -What? [CAR DOOR CLOSES] -This guy seems to have some unorthodox practices. [ENGINE STARTS] I'm sure it doesn't matter. Everything will be fine. I'll send them a check in the morning. [CAR ENGINE FADES] [DOOR CLOSES] MR. LUCARD (OFFSCREEN): Fonda should never have been allowed be leave here with the old lady's body. We must get her back here as soon as possible. I want her staked tonight, and I don't care who does it as long as she's dead by tonight! [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [SOFT CREAKING] -What's going on down there?

I've heard enough for one night. -I don't want to go back there alone. -Well, I'm not going back. -(ANGRILY) Ordell, you're coming back with me! -Don't you start giving me orders! I said I've heard enough for one night! -The sheriff's coming back. [AMBULANCE DOORS CLOSE] [DRIVER DOOR SLAMS] -Well, that about wraps it up. There's not much more I can do here. -Were you able to identify him? -No, probably just a drifter. My guess is he broke in for a radio or something easy to sell. You scared him and he panicked. But he's definitely not a pro. Uh, listen. I'll try not to bother you with this in the next couple of days. I know you just lost someone you love. -Thank you, Sheriff. -Good night, Mrs. Fonda. -Good night, Sheriff. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] -Are you all right? -I'll be fine. -I think we better get some rest. [HEART BEATING] [WOODPECKER PECKING] [BED SPRINGS SQUEAK] [BRUSH SOFTLY CLATTERS ON DRESSER] [SOFT THUDDING] -Ted? -Shh. Don't say anything. I want you to take it easy. I'm sending for the doctor. -No! I don't want the doctor. -You've had a terrible shock. I want the doctor to see you. -Where is he? -I have to call him. -Ted, why? I don't understand. -I said lie still. You're going to be all right. I have to make a few calls. I don't know, I just have a strange feeling. -What are you going to do? -I'm going to call the sheriff. [FOOTSTEPS FADE] Sheriff Ordell, please. When will he be back? Would you have him call Ted Fonda as soon as he gets in, please? Yes, thank you. [RECEIVER CLATTERS IN CRADLE] -Was he there? -He was out on a call. He'll call us when he gets back in. Look, I'm not going to wait for him. I think I know where your mother is. -Ted, please wait for him. -I can't. -I'll be all right. -I'll be back as soon as I can. [FOOTSTEPS FADE] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYS] [ENGINE APPROACHES] [ENGINE CUTS OFF] [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] -Please have a seat, Mr. Fonda. Now, would you be so good as to tell me what this is all about? -You know damn well the meaning of this visit. -Mr. Fonda, must I remind you where you are? -Mr. Lucard, last night someone died trying to steal something from my mother-in-law's house. -I'm sorry. How awful. -Sometime after that, someone broke in and for some ungodly reason, stole my mother-in-law's body. -What did you say? -Someone stole her body. -My god! -Is that supposed to mean you know nothing about it? -Of course not. Why should I? -Because I think you're behind it. I think you tried twice. The first time, you got someone killed. -That's absurd! -Is it? Who else wanted her? -Mr. Fonda, I think you have been under a tremendous mental strain lately. m it's gotten the best of you. -Answer me, Lucard. Who else would want a corpse? -I think you are the victim of a grotesque prank. I sympathize, but I strongly suggest you consider the consequences before making any hasty accusations. -I'm going to search this place before I leave here. -No you're not. If you wish to pursue it in a peaceful manner, contact the authorities. [DOOR OPENS] [TRAFFIC SOUNDS] -I'll be back. [STATIC AND RADIO CHATTER] -Go ahead. SHERIFF ORDELL (ON RADIO): This is Ordell, Lucard. I've got a drowning victim out here. -Where are you, 14? SHERIFF ORDELL (ON RADIO): Horner Lake. -Listen closely, 14. I want you to leave the victim there. I'll handle it myself. Get over to the Fonda's and smooth things out. He's on to us. -Will do. What about the code 1? Never mind code 1, I'll handle it. -Anything else? -No. -10-4 base. Over and out. Come on. Let's bring him over to the side. -And you're sure you didn't hear any noise, Mr. Fonda? -Nothing. -Hm. Any windows broken upstairs? -No. -Hm. Were all the doors locked? -That's right. -Hm. Thank you. Have you any idea who would do this? -As a matter of fact, I have. -Well? -I think Lucard has something to do with it. -Lucard? What makes you say that? -The day I brought my mother back from the home, he came over here and demanded on taking her body back. I had to throw him out. -Well, there was a legal complication. -That's another thing. He never did pursue it illegally, did he? I mean, if he was right, why didn't he get a court order or a warrant or something? I'll tell you why. He thought he'd just come back here and take her. -Well, he probably tried not to aggravate the situation. He did file a complaint, you know. -I wasn't aware of that. It doesn't change my mind even if he did. I'm convinced he sent that man over here last night. And when he failed, he came back himself. -Are you telling me that robbery attempt was for your mother-in-law's body? -That's right. -I think this is all starting to be a little bit far-fetched. -Listen to me, Sheriff. I know I'm right. I even went over there this morning and accused him to his face. SHERIFF ORDELL (OFFSCREEN): Well, what did he say? TED FONDA (OFFSCREEN): He denied it, of course. Did a lousy job of acting surprised. SHERIFF ORDELL (OFFSCREEN): What do you mean? TED FONDA (OFFSCREEN): Well, he pretended he knew nothing about it and put this little [INAUDIBLE]. SHERIFF ORDELL (OFFSCREEN): Well, maybe he didn't. TED FONDA (OFFSCREEN): I don't believe that. SHERIFF ORDELL (OFFSCREEN): Just exactly what do you want me to do? TED FONDA (OFFSCREEN): He wouldn't let me search the place. I'd like to get a warrant. -That would be a waste of time. Even if Lucard did this, I seriously doubt he would keep your mother-in-law on his premises. -Maybe so. But I'd still like to look. -I'll tell you what. Why don't I go down to Lucard's and have a sort of unofficial look around. This way if you're wrong, nobody's hurt. -That would be great, Sheriff. SHERIFF ORDELL (OFFSCREEN): In the meantime, I'll fill out a report and see what else we can come up with. But we really can't rule out the possibility of a prank. -That's what Lucard said. -Oh, well, he may be right. He just may be right. I'm going over to Lucards now and have a look around. I'll get back to you later. -I appreciate it, Sheriff. Thank you. -Goodbye, Mrs. Fonda, Mr. Fonda.

How is he? -He's fine. -Really? I thought it might be too late. -Forget about the boy. What happened at the Fonda's? -No problem. Everything's fine. I told him I'd check the place out and get back to him later. -Well, forget about Fonda. We've got a bigger problem than that now. The old lady's walking. While some people were throwing themselves out windows and you were cruising the streets, she was coming to. Now she's walking! -And what were you doing, Lucard? -I know what I should have been doing. I should have been here looking after things myself. It's the only way to get things done around here! -It's your fault all this happened! -What the hell's the matter with you two. Haven't we got enough problems? -If that old lady shows up before we find her, we're done for! -Well, we'll just have to find her first, won't we? -I don't want anything done before I get there. Is that understood? [CRICKETS CHIRPING] -I'm going to get a doctor over here to give you something to help you sleep. You're going to lay right here until he arrives. OK? -Why didn't the Sheriff come back? -He probably didn't have anything to tell us. I'm sure he'll call us when he does. -Ted, I really don't need a doctor. I'll just sleep for a couple hours. I'll be all right. -You just lie back and be quiet, OK? Yes, hello? This is Ted Fonda, Mrs. Bradley's son-in-law. Thank you. I was wondering if the doctor could stop by this evening and have a look at my wife. No, I just wanted him to give her something to help her sleep. Right. That'd be fine. Yes, all right. Thank you. [PHONE RATTLES IN CRADLE] Well, that's that. She said the doctor will be over in a little while to give you something to sleep. So I don't want to hear another word out of you, OK? -OK. [ENGINE APPROACHING] -Oh, he's fine. How soon before he's ready? -Actually, he's ready right now, but he can wait. -Forget the boy, Ordell. He's mine. -Yours? -That's what I said. -You weren't next. -Neither were you. -Why should he get him? -He's mine! -All right. Let's get this thing over with. NURSE (OFFSCREEN): Oh, doctor. A Mr. Fonda called, Mrs. Bradley's son-in-law. He said that his wife seems to be taking it very hard, and he'd like you to come over and administer her a sedative. I told him you wouldn't be available until later this evening. -Cancel any other appointments I may have this evening. This will be the last one. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CLOSES IN DISTANCE] -Hi.
