''THE DEAD GIRL'S FEAST'' Goddamn it! Come on, you dumb Mestizo! Use the mirror! Stop! Stop! Use the brakes! Put it into first and try to do it right! Come on! l don't have all day for this! You're a moron, kid! Can you hear me? Are you deaf? That's good! That's it! Come on! -Shift into reverse and come back! -Hey, man! Are you setting the stall right there? Come on, dumbass! That's good! Stop the car! That's good! Now get out! Hey, man... Are you setting the stall over there? ldiot! Turn the engine off! Are you setting up in front of the house? l wonder why l hired you! Moron! Get out of that car! Let's unload the truck right here! The stall will be right in front of Saint's house! Are you listening to me? Are you, Native? You're sleeping? l can't believe this. Her dress is beautiful. Full of details beads and flounces. lt's just like the Dead Girl's. She made it with such care... lt makes me want to cry. lf l had a kid l'd dress him up as an angel. Not in black, vulture-like but as a celestial angel. Oh, come on. That angel thing is outmoded. l prefer a cute little dress, curly hair... A pretty little dress. Boys can't wear dresses. They should dress as angels. Auntie, auntie! The first miracle has happened! lt's not 8 o'clock yet, but the man is up! What's with that wrinkled face? You party too much! Did you sleep with me? At least say good morning! l'll open the door... Pray for us sinners, Holy Ghost! Stop it! -Amen! -Amen! -Your blessings, my Angel! -God bless you, Das Gracas! Good morning, Dead Girl... Your blessings, my Angel! But you are blessed, Auntie! Are you nervous, Auntie? The cloak looks beautiful, my Saint. But there's still a lot to do. It's a lifetime's work isn't it my Saint? Come here, L?cia! Your blessings. God bless you! Sing it! l"ve concentrated On thIs strength to perceive The mystery that Is right there l've concentrated on the forest... That part is wrong, L?cia! It's wrong! l've concentrated on thIs strength to perceive,,, lt's wrong! l'll kill a chicken for lunch. May l, Saint? Don't kill the black one. He loves his chickens! l'll do it on the wood stove, OK? Let's get the fire going and clean this up. Don't you light that stove! Put some rosemary in the ''cachaca'' to sweeten the mouth. Lighting a fire in this heat! Do it later! -l was going to add some cloves. -We've got some with cloves! Rosemary makes people tell the truth... Boiling water? Haven't l already told you? lt's for the sheets, my Saint. You should do it tomorrow. It's Burning Day. Too much is going on tomorrow to do it then. We've already got some with cloves! l want rosemary, for God's sake! l want the truth! l want the truth! You've got your nose in everything today. Just like his mother... cranky as ever! Mercy! l feel like moving away... Getting out here, Diana. To be the skipper of a proper boat, and only come here to visit Mother. l'd make sure l was far away during the Girl's Feast. ln Manaus, S?o Gabriel Bolivia or anywhere you like! Shall we leave? To Manaus, Diana! ln your dreams! -Let's go to Manaus! -You're daydreaming! To live without all this, Diana. Not having to thank the Saint every single year. Aren't you his friend? You don't seem to have much faith in him. lt's not that l don't like him... l don't like his father who is a drunkard! A scoundrel! All he cares about is women booze and... Just like you! l drink but l work, Diana! Ain't l here? l work! l've never seen him lift a finger! He pretends to be working on the boats, but he lives off the Saint... He lives off his son. And before that, he lived off his wife! He got himself a partner so they could make money off the feast. He's a tanned, bearded man. -lt's him. -l saw him. What for? Someone told me there's going to be a show or some bullshit like that. l saw the girls singing in S?o Gabriel. They were very good. l'm going to buy a gift for the Saint. Saint or not... there's no harm in trying. He's a nice boy. Yeah, right... Really, he is! He blessed my belly and everything went well for me and my daughter. Maybe it wasn't because he prayed, but... -Don't say that. -Why not? -lt sounds like you don't believe. -Believe what? We live on this work. And you call that a miracle, Diana? l'm not a fool. The Girl was never found! No one's ever found my sister! They found rags in a mongrel's mouth. And now everyone is on their knees calling him a Saint! You repeat yourself every year, Tadeu. We are the saints working like this in the' sun! He gives us work. He never leaves his house! He has no idea what's going on! Damn it! l don't buy that. You're always cooking! l'm always here in the river, damn it! What is he doing now? He is at home, all adorned... blessing people! A Saint, my ass! Mother of God l don't know how to pray l just can say l want to love you l want it, therefore l can do it! l want it, therefore l can do it! Blue is thy cloak White is thy veil l want to become Your little daughter in heaven l want to become Your little daughter in heaven The woman said animals with shells don't make you fat. And they're stimulants. l'm fat because of anxiety, worries... And l still have my obligations to my husband... And he likes it a lot... l'd better shut up! This isn't the right place. l had such a strange dream. My father and l were in the forest. l was grown up, but it seemed as though l was small. There was an ants' nest. Father smiled and told me to put my hand inside. l was scared to death but had to do it. Father laughed more and more. l pulled my hand out, but it didn't hurt at all. My hand was covered in ants... lt frightened me... So l ran to the river but there wasn't any water in it. l was desperate to get rid of the ants... lt was the Girl saying... The Girl is my business! Stop giving me lessons! Go on, L?cia! Move to the other bench! You woke up on the wrong side of the bed! lt looks like the world's has been shaken with my Saint right in the middle. Wild chickens are too tough. The white ones are tastier. The ones that are kept cooped up, aren't they, Dad? Yeah, my Saint. Today, there'll only be a few bottles of beer... They show their heads and we smash them! We're going to put up the banner at the entrance because there'll be more people this year. l can feel it! Later, l'll check things out by the river... Little torn dress That shows the way Together we pray fora good destiny You're growing up! So cute... That's wonderful! Dead Girl's Feast decorated with beer ads! The world has gone to the dogs! Gone to the dogs, Auntie? We've got to move forward in life! You know, evolve! Even the Pentecostals say it's not a sin to get rich! Come on, Auntie! One day, l'll get that chicken, boy. Go ahead, Dad. Do it. Go on! Damn chicken! Get out! This is like a boarding-house! lf we're not careful we'll end up scraping, scrubbing... washing and cooking... l'm God's lamb, too! lf it's to have fun then l want it too'! Come here... Tadeu is coming to sort the herbs. l'm not sure when. l'm going out... l have to get the creepers for your crown and see some people. The crown of twenty years must be very beautiful. Really pretty... Later then... The Dead Girl's feast The feast for those Who have left us lt is a bright night to cry To shed tears into the night lf fear weighs you down Set your feet on the ground Look around, see who is coming The world is an illusion Look around, see who is coming The world is an illusion The world is an illusion But if the day breaks blue Deep into the forest l want to see you on the ground Ready to wake up Ready to wake up... Diana l'm blessing her because it's you. The blessing of the Dead Girl should only be tomorrow. Thank you, my Saint. Tomorrow there will be many people... l didn't want to miss the blessing. Tomorrow l'll bring the present for the Girl's Burning Day. Yeah, right... Do you think Rom?o will come back? Come on, Diana, of course not! Or else he would've been here already! He doesn't come back! He's the kind that goes away! He goes away. All you've got now is your daughter. You never have good news for me, do you? When l met that man l thought: ''l'm never going to lie to him! Never! Neither to keep him, nor to lose him.'' Stop pecking in a plowed field and things will happen. Now l see it... This circus has become official! -Don't look at him! -Listen to me... What we need is greater authority! Do you understand? Go find your ilk and piss someone else off somewhere else! Things around here don't get worse... because l am very good... Because l'm very weak, and pure! l hardly know you! You know what? Go home take a bath and kneel down and pray! l'll only go home once l've taken down all this shit! What? Go home! Look at that! You could've avoided that! Show more respect, pal! You don't know me! l'm part of this shit, you prick. Get him, Native! Tadeu! ls this any way to behave? During the preparation for Girl's Day? The Saint is blessing people, and you're causing a rumpus! l am part of this bullshit! l saw my father come here every day of his life! We gave everything we had! Auntie knows it! -l know, let's go home. -Auntie knows it! This used to be a happy place! Take it easy! -And now, that son of a bitch comes! -Not another word out of you! You go right back home! You treat people as if you were the Almighty! Just look at yourself! Filthy and in rags! Spoiling a nice day for everyone! A nice day! -A nice day, my ass! -A nice day! A nice day! lf you like it or not, they found the girl! You owe him that, Tadeu! Calm down now. Don't yell. May the silence of your voice and soul be your prayer! -They found my sister, Auntie! -l know, son... Come with me. l'll give you a nice cold bath. Don't worry, Das Gracas! l'm taking him. Take it easy, son. Look at you, all beaten up! You shouldn't do this! Do you understand? Oh, my Saint! Tadeu is showing no respect again! He's drunk, the bastard! Tadeu's shameless! lf only we had a real man in this house to help us! We have to do everything! Wash, iron, cook... and even fight, my Saint! That was a fight! Auntie who is almost an elderly woman had to drag him away! Lucia, go see if you can find Father. l'm worried about him! Go on! Go on, you bum! Go straight to school! Don't stay by the river! -My Saint, may l make an offering? -Fine. l've blessed you, it's done! Go away! May God be with you! Father said he would bring the creepers but he still hasn't. l still have to make the crown for the offering. He said he wouldn't drink today, but you can't trust him. And l bet Tadeu is not coming to sort the herbs! Your father should've already come back, but he hasn't. He's enjoying himself... He's out boozing with his buddies. Pawing the girls... Temptation! -That's why your mother... -Stop, Das Gracas! You're going to far! l"ve concentrated On this strength to perceive The mystery that is right there l"ve concentrated On the forest to know The love l have received l"ve been a girI, a youngster And then a woman And now l am here Where am l? Where am l? Where is the miracle That is coming? The charmed mystery Came to tell me ''On Iy with faith and patience Can we reach victoy'' Little torn dress That shows the way Together we pray fora good destiny Little torn dress That shows us the way Together we pray fora good destiny l'll tear your dress... Stop! L?cia is here! -ls that L?cia? -Yes. L?cia! Come over here, L?cia. Come here! The Saint wants you to make the crown for the offering. l have to prepare the festival! l have to prepare the festival because... my son's the boss! Hey, L?cia, fancy a dip? Come here. l'd better go back. l'll see you later... Tadeu has gone mad! God forgive me. l'll sort out the herbs myself. Do you think there'll be many blessings tomorrow? The Girl says so. We'll need lots of gifts for the Burning procession. Tadeu won't stop complaining. He doesn't want these things in front of his house. He even fought with Mr. Anderson. l don't like the guy, but why fight? Fighting is terrible, my Saint. Oh, Daughter... my blood pressure... l think l might faint. That Anderson guy is not important. And Tadeu always complains too much! If he doesn't want to sort the herbs l'll do it myself. Let go! l should be doing that! Let go! Let go, Auntie! Get me a glass of water, son. Water... Water... Water... Water... Water! Auntie, do you think l'm different? Get me a glass of water, my son. Do you think l'm special? Special? Of course! You're a saint! You see things, you heal people. You're different. You're white like your mother. As if you were made out of clouds. White like flour... Not like the people from here. They are all natives. l fell dizzy... lt goes like this: Mama nurses the iittle girl Daddy feeds her And Grandma slaps her bottom That's so you'll be quiet, not cry, and so that you will learn. OK? Don't cry, or you'll get a spanking! But Mommy won't hit you because you're a good girl who never complains, right? That's right... You can't say Mommy mistreats you just because you shouldn't cry Or SCreaM... lf you do, Mommy will get even angrier! So, lets get ready for a walk You're good for nothing! Not good for washing, not good for cooking. Nothing! Sometimes l feel like smacking you in the face! l'm telling you... l regret many things, many things... l cry in my heart, not of joy, but of anger! l'm so mad! Know what a Native does when someone angers him? He kills him and eats him like a fish. And that's what l'll do to you. l will! One day l said: ''Let's walk, and work together!'' But you said: ''No, it hurts here and there. l can't do anything''. You see? Now you understand! But if you don't understand, l don't care! l don't care at all. l'm so mad! l feel like walking away and forgetting all this shit! l'm at a loss for words. The pretty brunette left me Never to return The pretty little princess Went away, faraway What will l do without you? What can l do without your love? l got used to your soft kiss OnIy you know the secret My brunette, your kiss,,, How can l ever forget lf you ever return l swear l'll love you, love you,,, Hey, Auntie! Get me a beer, Auntie! You're not teaching the song correctly to the girls! Go to bed, Father. We have to get up early. -l can't go to sleep this early. -You're already half asleep! l can hardly hear the TV with all that plink-plonk. What plink-plonk, Saint? l'm modernizing the Girl's tune! Yeah, right... lt doesn't look like anyone's turning up. You're right! l told everybody to get an early night. Tomorrow is an important day: The Dead Girl's 20th anniversary. l can't be tired when l make the revelations. l'll go get some rest. l must rise early tomorrow. l have to slaughter the pig and prepare the skewers. The Triplets are really singing tomorrow? Yes, but after all the blessings and the gifts are burnt. l thought about Mother today. l always do that on the Girl's Day. l'd like to remember her... l can't remember where l put the Girl's song lyrics. lt was right here! But L?cia knows it by heart. Auntie said l was like her. l mean... not the way l look but in my manners. Here it is! The lyrics! l knew it! l'm not crazy, yet... Did you see the brawl Tadeu caused this afternoon? He just can't take his drink! l sure can take mine! Yeah, but only when l get angry. Apparently, the same thing happens when people get angry... A vein in the forehead swells. The same thing happened when Mother got angry too. Did you think she was pretty? Judging by the photograph, l don't think so. l remember l thought she was pretty. But not in the photos. lt happens, right? Some people just don't photograph well. l still hear her voice sometimes... singing in Italian. She... That's a good one! Get it over here. There we go. Come on! Father! Father! Your father said l should come speed things up. There's a lot of things to do and it's already late! The faucet, Father... Did you see it, L?cia? lt's almost ready! l told Father that we need more creepers. Yes, it's beautiful. The cloak is becoming more and more beautiful. Bless me, my Saint? l went to bed late yesterday. l feel anxious today. lt's the same every year. l live it all over each time. Was it Father who let you in? Who let you look at the cloak? Who let you look at the cloak? Who let you? Open up the window! Open up the window! -Has Auntie come back yet? -She's watching them slaughter the pig. l can't watch. It's having such a hard time dying. The altar must be decorated this morning... before the washing. The Girl wants a lot of flowers. Many flowers this year. Tadeu is outside waiting to talk to the Saint. Get out, L?cia! Come in, Tadeu. l'd like a word with you, Saint. Close the door! You didn't come to sort the herbs. l had to do it by myself, when it should've been you. You're right, Saint. lt's just... l know that... Every year l try to help. You know that l have great respect... lf you have something stupid to say, say it! This year l won't be coming to fetch you... No way! No way! We all know you're a bit slow... but l do all this for your sake, too! What do you think? That it's easy? That it's all hunky-dory! l've devoted my whole life to this! lt's your duty! Do you have a choice when it comes to duty? No! lt's all part of the revelation! lt's all part of the revelation! Look at your sister! She cries when you lose faith! Look at her when you say no to me, Tadeu! Look at her, Tadeu. Sit down. Sit down, Tadeu! ldiot! What do you want to do? Ruin everything? lngrate! Don't you think of your Mother who is alive? She almost died of grief... l saved her by a miracle! l saved her by a miracle! For God's sake! Why won't that pig die? For the love of God! What about his mother? -Did she really die? -Yes, goddamn it! She smashed her head against the washtub, fell on the floor, and died. The Saint simply called her name and she came back. lt gives me goose-bumps just thinking about it. The Saint's always been able to see things. Where is she? Who? His Mother! Aren't we talking about her? How am l supposed to know? How am l supposed to know? Where do the dead and the living-dead go? This is how the miracle came true And the Boy's mother returned This is what the whole world pledged And the Girl's dress he found l learned to believe in the things He says There is not a greater faith Except that within me, within me This is how the Saint arrived Where God sent him ln the river of destiny he bathed ln the forest, there is nothing alike Neither here, nor beyond This is why everyone will praise And celebrate the Girl's words -By the Girl's dress. -All of us God will bless! Here before me l confess to be the sinner that l am. l confess to be the good and evil that governs the helm of the vessel that l am in. l confess to be possessed of the 13 theological virtues, and the l mortal sins. When the earth repeats that there are no more. l confess for being a man. For being a fallen angel from God's heaven. For being the monster that has come out of the deepest cave. l confess... for being myself, Me the way l've come into this world, to say that l am here... before me. What about the Girl? ls it true she was eaten by vultures? lt's true... Then the dog brought her pieces and put them in the Saint's hands! He speaks to the animals like... Saint Francis of Assisi! l'm going up there to be blessed later on. May l? Malagueta, not only you can, but you ought to. Now l'm beginning to think there'll be more pork than beer. Tell me... Do people like pork around here? What a question, buddy! People eat anything around here. That's better. For the Dead Girl! For the Dead Girl! Look, boy! The stall's set up! And it looks beautiful. Very beautiful. l'm going out to take a look around... But the ladies will take care of everything! Shaman Americo has arrived too. Besides taking care of the house, they'll look after you! -l'll be out there but... -OK, Father! Try not to drink too much! Of course, my Saint! My Saint! What time will the blessings commence? We'll do them from five until nine p.m. The Triplets show will start afterwards. Only till 10:30, OK? So as not to interfere with the Search. l've never seen a religious festival with a musical show. Come here... He didn't bless anybody yesterday. Only Diana! She showed up early and got him angry. l only hope he doesn't forget to bless the household. l think the household has the right. So do l. Mr. Cico was so angry at me yesterday. He said that l only care about the Saint and that the house has gone to pot. He's out there getting smashed with his buddies. l wonder how much he'll drink! The Saint's father is angry! He can drink anyone under the table! And as for women... l warned you! lf you play with matches, you'll get burnt! What's that? Go away! Go away! Get out! l'll open one up! Put one more. This meat is still rare! Hold on! Hey, Indian! Look after that barbecue! Let's get to work! Put two more! Put three more there! What festival is this? What miracle is this? True saints make miracles. Where is the miracle? All we've got here is a bunch of men boozing on the streets. It's entertainment for them not for us. For those who like it, it's fun! There's no miracle at all! There's no miracle, Mom. Your girl's gone! My sister died anyway. None of this will change anything! Too sad. But sadness can fade. God gives us sadness and then he gives us happiness. So, we should think about God not about sadness. What is gone can never come back. Virgin washed in tears Cover me with thy cloak With Christ's blood l bathe myself With Christ's blood I judge myself When the Girl walked upon this world She did it by healing and praying Malicious he, l shall break you With this blessed cloth God made you, God created you He shall take the evil that possessed your body God made you, God created you He shall take the evil that possessed your body Mercy, GirI, Mercy! Look at the Girl's dress! This Girl's Feast Day... -Anderson. -l'm coming! ...was fabulous! lt was fabulous! My Saint is in there, bringing the Girl's word for all to hear. And he's a good speaker. He talks here, he talks there... The Girl is intelligent! My Saint is very intelligent, smart... -We really hit the bull's-eye!. -Sure did! l'll be damned! All you have is luck. You must be blessed everyday... White magic! Yes, white magic. My son performs white magic. -Black magic is for witches! -Witchcraft! Hey, you prick! What are you laughing at? l don't pay you to laugh! You're drinking again, aren't you? lnstead of helping with the fire, you get wasted! Do you know her? Who don't we know in this town? Fuck you! Where is that fucking Native? What did he say? for now,,, She on Iy lives in our thoughts Or in the heavens ln everything that flies the skies lt may be an astronaut Or even a baby bird She may have turned into a breeze A tissue-paper kite Perhaps a little balloon Ora little asteroid She maybe the Evening Star That one can see from here She maybe living on Mars No one has heard of her again She has faded away faded away... My little Saint! My little Saint! -My Saint! -No! No, lady! Don't say that! Lady! My son! My son! My Saint... My darling son... My darling Saint... My Saint... My Saint, please... The tap still leaks! They're talking about you all around, even in Manaus, son. Your aunties even asked me for an autographed photo... Oh, how beautiful! ''Mother-pain'', ''Permanent scar Death desire grinds the teeth.'' How beautiful! Oh, the girl's dress! Torn to pieces! Poor thing... Poor thing... A dog brought it to you, didn't it? lt's a miracle, son! A miracle... l came from Manaus to ask... No! l came to thank you... l came to thank you, my Saint! l did not die! You brought me back to life. l'm alive. You did it! There are people Who love a thousand things But they lose themselves On the roads of life And l Who on Iy love You Will retain myself And offer to you in gift What remains Of my youth... l have these terrible headaches. My husband used to beat me, but it never hurt that much. Ever since he died l get terrible migraine' s l must have a womb problem... And back pain. lt must be some hex. Migraines over my eyes... Back pain... Some evil person must have put a hex on me. Don't you think so, my Saint? l am also a nervous wreck... l get nervous about everything... For no reason. Just like that girl from the soap-opera, the blonde one. l get upset, so upset and then l start crying! lt makes me want to drink some ''cachaca''. Feel like doing something crazy... l tried to cut myself with a kitchen knife... They caught me, though. When l lived with a tough man, l didn't try that... Now, with an easy-going man, l get upset. The cut didn't go deep, l didn't even need stitches. It doesn't hurt anymore... Nor does this... lt's been a long time. A long time. l heal well, though. l did have stitches in my forehead, but no pain... That's how l am... l heal... Bitch! Do you think your father will forgive me? l thought of coming before, but you know how life is... Tough man... l came from far away. To thank you and to be blessed. Bless me. Bless me! Bless me, bless me, bless me!

The Cardinal fish was born,,, The primary native vision Let go! Why did she come? -Why did she come? -Take it easy! This year, the Girl was in me and said she had no revelation. There's no revelation and that's that! This year... The girl said... Where is my father? Take it easy, Saint! He's coming. Where's my black chicken? Where's my black chicken? The black one!

Spoken and blessed by the mouth and by the hands of the Saint who here and now receives the Dead Girl's voice and gives blessings in her name. In the name of God of Christ of all the Saints. ln the name of beings that dwell in the forest and the waters the forces of the wind and the forces of the world. This it is because my God looks down and protects those who believe in the Girl. Amen! -For the Girl! -Hurray! -For the Dead Girl! -Hurray! -Your gifts for the Girl! -Hurray! Amen! For our Saint!

No matter singing from start or from end The sense will never change No matttersinging from start orfrom end The sense will never change l have concentrated On this strength to perceive The miracle is here to show We have concentrated on the forest To know The love we have received l have been a girI, a youngster, And then a woman And nowl am here Where am l? Where am l? Where is it? Where is the miracle that is coming? The charmed mystey came to tell me ''On Iy with faith andpatience Can we reach victoy'' Litttle torn dress thatshows the way Togetherwe pray... lt's the end of everyything... lt's the end of everything... l almost fell. Almost... The girl hasn't said anyything this year! l have concentrated on the forest To know The love l have received l have been a girI, a youngster, And then a woman And nowl am here Where am l? Where am l? Where is it? Where is the miracle thatis coming? The charmed mystey came to tell me ''OnIy with faith and patience Can we reach victoy'' l don't want to go! Move that light away! Move the lights away from the Saint! This year... This year the word is pain! Pain is the word that she said. Pain is the word. For the Saint! Pain is the word because you can never leave it behind, you carry with you. And to feel the pain is to let yourself be carried away with pain. lt's jumping over a wall and seeing pain on the other side. But pain does not hide, it emerges. The Girl was born in pain. She grew dead! And now, through the Saint's mouth, she says that she's back because she cannot forget the pain. So this year, pain is the word. And you shouldn't be frightened. lf you do, you'll always be lonely! The Girl said not to get distracted in pain, as if it was nothing. l'm not saying that for myself, but for your happiness! Whoever fears pain fears both day and night. He fears the ants. The ants... That's why the Girl came back and spoke of pain. Because that's where she grew up. She will never grow old, because she died as a girl. Maria Cecilia came but spoke so little this year. Maria Cecilia... spoke so little. Just a word. And that's what she said. And that's what she said.
