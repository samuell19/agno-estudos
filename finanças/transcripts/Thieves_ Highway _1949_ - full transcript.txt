(Man singing in Greek) The loud one's my old man. You owe me a buck-ninety. (Nick) Keep the change. (Singing) (Singing) Hey, Nicko! Hey, Mitera. Mitera! - Is Nicko! - Hiya, Pop! (Speaking Greek) - How's my girl? - (Parthena) Oh, Nicko! Why you don't write? Why you don't telephone you coming? - I get ready, I cook up dolmades. - Because I want to cook up surprise. - Where's Polly? I called her from the station. - Oh, she not here. - Oh, she don't like you. - How you doing, Pop? What are you doing home? I heard him singing three blocks away. - Look, presents for everybody. - (Parthena) Presents? - The big box is a lamp from India. - Oh, India. China. Japan. Africa. Melanese Islands. Oh, you hear, Mitera? Man of the world, Nicko. I bet he's the best mechanic on the ship. Shoot a rod, they send for me. Blow a valve, they send for me. Yeah, they cry when you quit. Look, Ma, earrings for you. Dancing girls in Java wear them. No. No, Nick. I'm too old. You wear them. You're my dancing girl. Papa? Look what I got for Polly's pop. - Oh, looks just like him. - Just about. - (Polly) Nicky! Nicky. - Shh! Nicky! Oh, where is he? (Nick barking) (Polly) Oh, Nicky! No! Nick, stop. Bravo! Oh, Nick, where did you get that awful thing? One of the Cannibal Islands. Polly. Dancing girls wearing them in...? Nicko? - Java, Ma. - In Java. - (Polly) Oh, they're lovely. - And here's something for you. Oh, isn't she pretty. Oh, thank you, Nick. I like it very much. I'll use is it as a pincushion. The finger. Keep your eye on the finger. Oh, Nicky. Oh, it's beautiful! Why, it must have cost a fortune. (Singing) - What do you think of that now? - That's wonderful. 1800 smackers. Enough to go into business with your old man. You should hear his plans. He's got an option on a vacant lot. (Nick) Hey, jive-boy. These I got for Pop. All the way from China, Mandarin slippers. The Chinese have small feet. I had a tough time getting your size. Here, try them on. See how they fit. What's the matter? Did I say something bad? All I said was, try them on. I can't try on, Nicko. Why not? - Pop. - Cover me, Nicko. What happened? - Tell me, what happened? - Nicko. I came in here like a clown. I couldn't tell... - He plays the phonograph, he sings. - What I'm gonna do? I don't lose my head, just my legs. What happened? - Tell me what happened. - I got a nice truckload tomatoes... Earlianas, first of season. I leave with produce dealer, Mike Figlia in San Francisco, on consignment. I go back for money. He say he sell good, for good price. "Come on, we have party," he say. "I buy you drinks." I go for drink. Two, three glass wine. I say, "Now you pay me money." Mike Figlia say, "Sure, I'm gonna pay. "Have another glass wine." Two fellas from market, they say, "Come on, Pop." So we drinks lots of wine. I laugh, I feel good. I have good time. I think how happy Mama gonna be when I come home throw money like leaves all over the floor. I don't remember no more. All I know is here it hurt. It hurt. (Parthena) For long time he don't believe his legs gone. He think new legs will grow. Don't you know how it happened? They find truck turned over in ditch. Yeah, they find me. But they don't find money. I think Mike Figlia, he don't pay. I telephone Mr. Figlia in San Francisco. He say he pay. - He no pay. - My father saw a lawyer. - He say forget all about. - I never forget. - The lawyer got in touch with Figlia. - He have two witnesses - who say he pay. - I say he no pay. All right, Ma, leave him alone. I'll see you tonight after you get home from work. (Polly) Sure, Nicky. So long. Pop, those two witnesses. Did they work for Mike Figlia? Yeah. They big crook too, they big liar. He's right, Mom. He never got paid. They just got him drunk, put him in his truck and sent him home. And on the way he probably fell asleep at the wheel. Where's the truck? Insurance company fix. I got no legs. I don't need it. I sell it to trucker named Ed Kinney. Ed Kinney. He don't pay no money. Just take the truck and give promise. You're doing good all around, ain't you, Pop? Where's this guy live? Why, Nicko? I'm gonna get that truck and gouge your money out of Figlia's carcass. - Is no use, Nicko. - I want to see Figlia, Mom. Where's the truck? Maybe Mama's right, Nicko. Maybe Figlia pay. Maybe somebody steal money from truck after I have accident. Where does Kinney live? Sixteen hundred block, Elm Street. But you leave Ed Kinney alone. He know more about crop than anybody in state. He pay me. You're a pushover, Pop. Hey, get-rich-quick, somebody to see you. - (Ed) Tell him I'm busy. - He says he can't see you. Tell him I can see him. Better come out, honey, looks like the man's gonna stay. - Yeah? - My name's Nick Garcos. You haven't kept up payments. I'm taking the truck back. You don't have to do that. I'll pay. - When? - Day after tomorrow. All the money I owe in one lump, and a box of cigars for your old man. My old man falls for that, but not me. Where are the keys? Tell him I need the truck. I got a big haul coming up. Can I have the keys? I bought this truck from your old man. I'll talk to him. You'll talk to me. Where are the keys? Look, kid, this bargain your old man sold me. I've been keeping it together with spit. The universal's shot. The rear end's coming apart. I'd be glad to give it back, but I need it for one more haul. Just one. If your old man's worried about his money tell him Ed Kinney's got the first load of Golden Delicious apples. If you can buy apples, why don't you pay for the truck? I haven't got a dime. This crop's so hot two guys are buying me a load just to find out where it is. You talk just like my old man used to. Always blowing off a lot of smoke. Now let's have the keys. You'll have to kick my face in to get them, brother. I know when I got a good thing. Been hauling a long time. I found this orchard where they come ripe early. A south slope that catches the sun. Golden Delicious apples! It's like money in the bank. Ask your old man if any produce dealer wouldn't give his eye-teeth to get them. Would they...? They go for them in San Francisco? They eat apples, they ain't snobs. They'd grab them up like that. - Do you think Figlia might be interested? - That chiseller. He'd be so crazy to get them he might even make a straight deal. It's too bad your old man is laid up. He'd go in with me if he had 1200 bucks. And I wouldn't have to go with these other two guys. They ain't no friends of mine. But your old man, I like him. He used to be a good trucker. We could buy two loads of Golden Delicious, one for him and one for me and make a killing. (Man) Hey, doc! The two guys I was telling you about. Wish I didn't have to go in with them. They're sharp. I got a hunch they'll bounce me after they find out where the apples are. (Slob) Hey, you beanpole, you long drink of... When are you gonna get that gas-buggy heated up, huh? Maybe I could raise 1200 bucks. (Pete) Hi, Ed. Got her all set to go? (Ed) She's ready to roll. That's our partner, boy. That's our partner. After we pick up the money tomorrow noon, we're on our way. I told you. Tomorrow's too late. You should have been here yesterday. We ain't going nowhere. The deal's off. - What? - I don't hear you. The farmer said he sold the whole orchard to a big shipper. (Pete) He can't do that. You said he made a deal with us. Yeah, you can't trust nobody these days. How do you like that? Kissed off before we get a chance to pucker up. I know how you feel. Well, something may come up next week. Keep in touch with me. I got my eyes open. Great. Great. I should have known it when I had that dream. I had a dream that I had a handful of $1000 bills, and when I woke up... No, no. Don't sound kosher. Don't sound kosher. - What do you mean? - He's taking it too easy. What do you want him to do? Wriggle in the dirt there and have convulsions? That's just it. He don't feel bad enough. (Ed) We'll need another truck. I know a guy who's stuck with a lot of war-surplus jobs. Triple-A Garage. That's where they got this. Just give him a down payment and we're in business. Tell him Ed Kinney sent you. That was a dirty trick you pulled. This ain't no lace pants business. It takes tricks to get what you want in this game. You just buy the loads, I'll sell them. Trick me like that, I'd climb all over your neck. You wanna back out? Any time you like. - When do we go for the apples? - We'll start tonight. After you get the truck, go get some shut-eye. We'll be on the road for 36 hours. - You think you can make it? - Sure I can make it. But remember, no tricks. (Ed) Now why would I wanna pull a trick on you? Because I'm a pushover too, like my old man. I come down here to pick up this truck and I wind up blowing all my cash. But I want to tell you one thing: I worked like a dog for that dough. Gyp me and I'll cut your heart out. Thanks. I'll remember that. (Polansky) Pavel! What you do? Pick the apples. Olga, Fario, Mario is picking twice as many apple than you do. (Mrs. Polansky) Yo! (Speaking Polish) Truck not waiting. - What's the matter? - (Ed) Universal sounds like it's ready to go. - (Nick) So that's what I heard. - I was afraid it wouldn't hold out. - Look at that thing. - Oh, great! What do we do now? Don't get the shakes. I've been keeping this thing together with spit and I'm ready to spit all the way to the market. I'll need 1200 bucks. Will you get your end wrench and try to tighten those bolts? Just the front ones. I'll go down and pay off the old geezer. (Speaking Polish) My wife, she say to tell you, dollar a box. - That's right. - Thank you. Thank you. Good luck. Have a nice trip. And sell good my apple. (Mrs. Polansky) Papa! (Speaking Polish) Hey, wait! Hey, stop! Don't go, wait! Wait a moment. You didn't count right. You make mistake. You make mistake. This only 900. That's right, six bits a box. Six bits a box? Six bits is 75 cents. Seventy-five cents? You cheat. It's all I'm gonna pay. If you don't like it, have your apples back. - What you say? - I busted my truck pulling up your hill. I don't care if I haul them or not. (Speaking Polish) You take your money and I'll take my apple! Seventy-five cents. Papa! You cheat! Seventy-five...! Seventy-five cents, huh? Here! All this cheating! You, 75 cents. That... That is your value, what you want? (Nick) Nice going, Ed. Nice. - He cheat! - He says one dollar, he pays six bits. Saves two bits a box. That's a lot of dough. - 300 bucks. - So we could lose our shirts at a buck. What I am going to do with these apples? He got no truck. They gonna rot. - Give him his money. - What? - Go ahead. - We'll need it for the universal. We'll park your rig and come back for it later. Sure, we got lots of time. We're on a tour. You made a deal. Give him his money. Everybody will know about apples by tomorrow. They'll flood the market. We'll be peddling out of hats. Give him his money. Thank you. Thank you. You good boy. I tell from your face. Here's $5 for boxes he throw off truck. (Mrs. Polansky speaking Polish) You almost saved me 300 bucks. - Or weren't you gonna tell me? - Maybe you'd like to wash up the deal. Look, I buy the loads, you sell them. That still goes. No grudge? - No grudge. - Let's get the tarp on. - You go on ahead. I'll tail you. - Maybe I'd better tail you. Just in case you break down. No, you'd lose time that way. - You get south fast. - We're hauling north. Thanks. I thought the deal was you buy the loads, I sell them. Have the rest your way, but first we go north. (Ed) OK, it's your dough. (Slob) Hello. Hello. Well, looky, looky, looky. Hi. Hey, Pete, ain't we seen these boys some place before? Yeah, yeah. They do look familiar. Well, what do you know, they got apples. - What's the idea of following us? - That's very funny. Some guys has always got a suspicious nature. Now, why do fellas have to be like that? We weren't following them. It's just fate. Listen, did you ever stop to figure if we all showed up with apples... - ...we'd all come out with peanuts? - We understand that. We don't wanna cool off your load. No, that's the last thing we'd wanna do. - Listen, chisellers... - OK, it's free enterprise. We all wanna make a buck. We're gonna haul north. You guys haul south. Now there's a fella's got good manners. Go on, Slob. So long. Good luck. Maybe we'll see you again sometime. Listen, free enterprise, you know where they're gonna haul? Uh-huh. - Where? - San Francisco. They wanna go where you go. They figure you got the nose for a buck. We've got the jump on them. We're all loaded. But they can spell each other. We gotta drive alone. Get going fast. You better watch it going down the hills or you'll blow a tyre. You got an overload. - (Nick) I'll watch her. - If you get sleepy... ...stick your elbow out the window to wake you up. - (Nick) Right. - When you get to Frisco don't talk about the load. They see you're green and murder you. - Wait till I get there. - (Nick) I'll be waiting. Right. Forty-five, fifty. We got 150 bullets. Well, that won't buy too many apples, but we'll make some change. - Maybe we'll do better than that. - Huh? Listen to that guy's truck, sounds like she's beating eggs. Yeah, Slob, we're gonna make out fine. What's from beating eggs? Let's grab the apples and get going. There's no hurry, Slob. No hurry now. What are you...? (Tyre screeches) (Grunting) Maybe you better tail me, huh? Hey, Nick. Nick. Nick! Nick, try to get your head out of the sand. Nick, get your head up. Nick, Nick. Come on, get up. - Hi. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm OK. - Come on, let's get over to my truck. Hey. Hey! - Can you stand there for a minute? - Yeah, sure. - Let's take a look at that neck. - I'm OK. Let's go. Sure, you're OK. But I gotta fix that tyre first, don't I? I better put something on that neck too. Let's get over here in the light. There. Let's clean you up a little. It's good. Glad you've got a fast truck. Like the fella says, I got here, didn't I? Don't forget to clean behind the ears. I knew a guy once walked around for a full week with his neck busted. How does it look? Swing your head around. Go ahead, try it. Oh. - How does it feel? - Great. Haven't got a bandage. - There's a handkerchief in my pocket. - No, I'll use mine. Hey. - What? - I bet we look silly sitting here. Yeah. - You think you'll be able to drive? - Sure I can drive. - Let's change the tyre. - Oh, no, you'll watch. Next time you'll know better than to jack up a truck with the back of your neck. - Ed. - Yeah? I'd be a goner if it wasn't for you. Yeah. (Honking) (Shouting) Hey. Hey, you. Hey. Say, what do you do with a guy...? They ain't gonna let you sleep, so how about moving this heap out of the way. Hey there, sonny boy. - How long you gonna park here? - Just for a little while. Well, that happens to be a loading platform, sonny. Well, I... I'm only going around the corner to check on some prices. Oh, say, that looks like a mighty fine load of apples you got there. - Go ahead. - Help yourself. - Can I have some of that? - Sure. - Get the guy a paper cup. - Never mind. Thanks. (Man) Want to try it? There's asparagus packing on ice. Hey, Mac, what do you think of this? Hey, that's a nice apple. What do you think it's worth? - What's it worth? - I don't know. Ask the boss. Thanks. - Stop bartering. Take it or leave it. - (Man 1 ) I'll take it. (Man 2) Give me my wagon! (Man 3) You're next. (Man 4) What are we gonna do with you? Juice is juice. Too dry. How do you like that? - Are you selling or pricing? - What are they worth? A lot more than I can give. People who deal with me, little grocery stores, can't afford to pay off. - Where can I find Mike Figlia? - Mike Figlia! (Speaking Italian) - What'd he say? - He says Mike Figlia stinks. - Where can I find him? - You're practically in front of him now. Hey, why you wanna get mixed up with him? There are plenty of straight outfits here. Thanks. - What do you mean, $12 a crate? - That's Golden... I don't care if it is Golden Bantam. People won't pay two bits an ear to eat this stuff. OK, I'll give you ten crates at 12 and five at 8.5. You're so nice to me. I'll take it if you make me a deal on 20 boxes of Golden Delicious. I'll give you just one bite. I ain't got no Golden Delicious. No apples, no corn. If you're gonna take me, it's gotta be worth it. (Figlia) Hey, wait a minute. How about 20 boxes of strawberries, you can twist my arm on the corn. I want apples. Apples! What do you want me to do, pull them out of my hat? What? (Indistinct whispering) Huh? Come back later. Might be a deal on the apples. - Jocko. Gonna park there long? - Is there a law against it? No, but I don't like it. Hey, Fig, maybe he's got something you can use. I don't do no business with wildcat peddlers. What do you know? Apples. - They're not for sale. - How's that? I said you don't do business with wildcat peddlers. Get your truck out. It's in the way. Anything wrong? My tyre's flat. I got stuff moving in and out of here all the time. Maybe you can pump it up faster. Hey, Dave, give the man a hand. What do you say? Think we might be able to use them? I'd have to see the entire load. (Laughing) Charles has a great future. Never wants to takes a chance. - I'm willing. - Aren't you afraid you'll lose your shirt? What'll you take for the whole load, as is, cash on the line? What do you think it's worth? It's hard to say, Mr. Figlia. Now if they're all like this one... - You call that an apple? - What's the matter? It's pulpy. It's not worth bringing in. Tyre won't come up. I keep pumping but she won't come. That's a shame. It looks like you're gonna be stuck here for a while. If you're a nice boy, I might be able to handle this load. What'll you pay? - It's kind of early for apples. - First crop's always pulpy. Yeah, you know, there's no demand. Hey, hey! - Peppers? I can't give them away. - You ordered them. Put them in the back. Unless you wanna dump the load now, take them on consignment. Consignment? Kind of deal you like to make on tomatoes, isn't it? (Man) Sign this, Mike, we're waiting. Hey, how about a straight sale? How much? Two bucks won't hurt too much. - That's $1200. - Cash, right in your fist. Sounds pretty good. I'll talk to my partner when he gets here. Hey. You gotta sell to someone, might as well be me, huh? I'll be glad to sell to you, a square guy. You offered me a fair price. You got a good reputation. OK, OK get your truck out of here. I can't. Somebody cut the tyre. Hey, Dave, call up the Circle Garage. Tell them to send a tow truck, get him out of here. Figlia, you're used to pushing around old men. Touch my truck and I'll climb into your hair. The old man was easy. This kid's tough, huh? You want me to call the Circle Garage? - What for? - For the tow truck, to tow him out. You know, sometimes I'm worried for your future, Charles. I want that truck right where it is. See? See? Hey, Mike. See? Having trouble, doc? Slob, come on over here and give him a hand. - Hold the light for a fella. - Sure. Once a universal conks out on you, you're dead. When that hot sun hits your load tomorrow... Brother, baked apples. - Lots of room on our truck. - We'll toss them on for you and we'll get you to town in a jiffy. Anything to help. And all it'll cost you is half of what you make, bud. Hey, there's a spot on your chin there. Hey, you, what...? Just wanted to give you a helping hand. You're not such a bad egg. Everybody's just got you wrong. Two hundred bucks! "You're a crook," I say. He says to me, "When you insult me, look me in the eye." Why don't you get up and give the lady a seat. - What'll you have, lady? - Black. - Match? - No match. - Looking for someone? - Yeah, my partner. You look tired. You'd be tired too if you drove 400 miles without sleep. (Man 1 ) Hey! (Man 2) Why don't you look where you're going? (Man 1 ) All right, all right. You can sleep here Sundays. Market's closed then. You wanna come up to my room and rest? - What? - I'm the friendly type. No, I'm waiting for my partner. I'm looking for his truck. You can see the market from my window. No. I think I'll wait here. Sweet dreams. (Man 1 ) Hey, those are potatoes, not coconuts! (Man 2) All right, all right, all right. (Man 3) Come on. Let's go. (Man 4) Get them out of here. Hey! You talked me into it. (Engine rattling) (Honking) What have you got, a penthouse? Here we are. - Got a match? - No match. - It isn't The Ritz. - Oh, it's a nice place. Soft. Ever try sleeping in a truck? You get the steering wheel in your ear. You can sit down. No wheels in this bed. Thanks. You're French? - I'm Italian. - Oh, I went swimming in Italy once. - Yes, where? - A beach. Place called Anzio. Oh. - It's a long way from Italy. - It's a small world. OK. Here's to... friendship. Long and sweet. What's the matter, don't you like girls? Sure, I like girls. Always wished I had a kid sister. Wearing pigtails down to here. Giggling behind her hand and throwing sparks out of her eyes. You were somebody's kid sister once. And look at me now. You look nice. Nice face... ...nice eyes. Nice. You look like chipped glass. - Do I? - Yeah. Like right now. Took me a long time to get that way. (Rica) Seagulls. They fly over all the time. - They make me dream of drowning. - Why? How do you feel inside when you look like glass? I feel fine. - I'm sorry I took a cut at you. - Don't touch me! Why did I do that? Well. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. (Whistles) - (Figlia) Hey, Riley. - Hiya, Fig. Who you rooking today? If that's funny, why ain't I laughing? Look, you see that truck? - It's been in front of my place all night. - Why don't you ask the guy to move it? There's a great head for you. See how fast he figured it out? Bright. You find him, and I'll ask him. Say, that's the same truck. The kid with the apples. (Figlia) Will you get it out of there? I can't do no business. - I've got to talk to you. - Get in there. Get back here. - Listen. - What can I do for you, cutie? You told me to get that guy, but you didn't tell me he was hurt. Oh, he's hurt, eh? Hey, that's too bad. You didn't know, did you? Take him out of my room, he's in my bed. Well, it's your bed, honey. Here's your 50 bucks. What you do with him is your business. - You've got to get him out of my room. - What's on her mind? She says there's a gentleman in her bed. Will you kindly show her to the street. - You heard him. - You've got to get him out. Come on, I'm losing my patience! He's losing his patience. Hey, hey. Not that way. - Hey, Fig. - Yeah. You can't get this thing out of here. Look at that flat. Get a tow truck and pull him out. Tow truck! Ten tons on a chopped-up tyre? Say, that baby's loaded. - Well, then I'll unload it. - Another five minutes won't hurt you. Give me a chance to find the kid. Everything happens to me. The whole street, he's got to break down in front of my place. - Tough luck. - I'm the original tough-luck kid. Unload her? - What else? - Hey, how about the law? Charles, explain. Is the vehicle parked in front of our joint? - Yeah. - Has it been parked there a long time? - Yeah. - Is it obstructing our place of business? - Yeah. - Well? - We unload. - We'll sell this stuff on consignment. I'll give the kid a fair shake. If that's illegal, I guess I'm a crook. - Yeah. - Yeah. (Laughing) Hey, Gino, Alberto! Come on! Hey, Mario. Mario, you want a good deal? - With you? When hair grows here. - Mario. Apples! - Apples! Golden Delish! - How much? For you, six and a half a box. Fig, you big crook, but I take ten. OK, Charles. Take the order. Mario, ten boxes. Hey, Midge. You want apples? We got them. Where'd you steal them? They dropped from heaven. How many at six and a half? - Twenty. - Twenty boxes. Take Midge's order. (Shouting) Hey, Julio! Julio! Bring truck! The crook's got apples! Hey, get up. Hey. Oh, let me sleep, Ma. Ed! Is that you, Ed? - How long have I been here? - Oh, not long. - Fell asleep, huh? - Oh, I thought you were... Passed out? - Must've scared you. - Oh, you did. It's nothing, just a little blood. - I thought you were going to die. - I haven't got time. Well... For your neck I have a Band-Aid and iodine. - Oh, it isn't right, "iodine"? - Is right, iodine. Better let me wash it off first. - (Rica) How did it happen? - How did what happen? - Your neck. - Oh, that! I cut myself shaving. Hey, do you like apples? Everybody likes apples, except doctors. You know what it takes to get an apple so you can sink your teeth in it? You gotta stuff rags up tailpipes, farmers gotta get gypped. You jack up trucks with the back of your neck. Universals conk out. I don't know what are you talking about, but I have a new respect for apples. Cold water makes me feel like a new man. Oh, my! Sit down. (Rica chuckles) - What's so funny? - I don't know your name. Nick Garcos. - How does it look? - Beautiful. You know, you're OK. - Me too? - Yeah, you too. Going out of your way to give me your bed. Someday I'll be sleepy, you'll give me your bed. - You fixed my neck. - Someday maybe you'll buy me iodine. - Is right, iodine? - Is right. - Soft hands. - Sharp nails. - You like to make tough, huh? - I am tough. Is that your truck with the apples? Is it? Is it the one that looks like an Army truck? If they're your apples, Figlia's stealing them. He's selling them from the truck. (Engine rattling) (Charles) All right, take it easy. Take it easy. All right, one at a time. What do you want? (Man) How come first Golden Delish you got? How come biggest nose in the market you got? (Whistling) - Hey, hello, buster. - How you doing? - We're moving them. - How much you getting a box? - Three and a half. - You're so bashful, Figlia. Go ahead, tell him what you're getting. He's getting six and a half. Oh, that's nice. Thanks. Your rig was in the way, couldn't move it without unloading. - I'm selling them for you. - I said thanks. That's good. We've got 40 boxes left. That's 600 at six and a half a box. Hey! Where you get that six and a half stuff? That's what you're getting. Or is she wrong? - She's not wrong. - Six and a half is right. I'm selling out. - We can work this out up in the office. - What's the matter with working it out here? Six hundred at six and a half bucks a box makes 3900 even. I talk business in my office. Thanks. - He'll eat that kid alive. - I'll take odds on the kid. - Sit down. - I ain't staying long. Thirty-nine hundred bucks. I like you. Hey. Let's say you just rolled into town with a truckload of apples. Old Havana? What do you think would have been a fair price? - Six and a half bucks a box. - Six and a half is what I got. - I'm talking about your end. - Your end of nothing is nothing. You're a tough kid, huh? OK. OK, we'll split three and a quarter for you... - Six-fifty for me. - Hey, listen, you cheap peddler. I was in this business when you were still sucking a bottle. Probably got that load for a buck, a buck and a half a box. I'm giving you more money than you've ever seen in your life. When did you ever make more than a day's pay? You're getting red in the face, Mr. Figlia. Terrible, the way I lose my temper, huh? - I like you. - I don't like you. - Thirty-nine hundred bucks. - You sound like a busted record. Look, Mr. Figlia, you don't know me, but I know you. - You tried to take me. - Who said I tried to take you? - Who said it? - Never mind. Hey, wait a minute. I got it. That... Rica, that trick picked you up. Hey, the joke's on me! (Laughing) I tell you, if there's one thing Mike Figlia appreciates, it's a joke. OK, I'll admit it. I wanted your apples. You didn't want to sell. I paid that Rica 100 bucks to get you off the street. So she tells you. Hey. Ask me why she tells you, huh? Right now, she's planning how to roll you for all your dough. I don't mind being rolled by her, but from you I don't like it. - Give me my money. - Oh, what's the use! Give me my money. - I ain't got that much cash. - I'll take what cash you got. Write me a check for the rest. How do you know I won't stop it? I don't think you will. - What's the name? - Nick Garcos. My old man's Yanko Garcos. - You remember him. - Can't say that I do. He left a load of tomatoes on consignment with you about four months ago. - I sell a lot of tomatoes. - This load you remember. My old man said you never paid him for it and if he wasn't hurt he'd come back and squeeze it out of you. Oh, that guy. He ran around here squealing like a stuck pig. It's our own fault. We let cheap peddlers like you on the street. Check ain't signed. Do you mind picking that up? Terrible, the way I lose my temper. Hey! Hey. I mean it! I like you. Thirty-four hundred dollar check, 500 bucks in cash. Yeah, it's quite a killing, huh? Take good care of it. Don't lose it. Take good care of your health. If we had some clams, we could have some steamed clams. That is, if you like steamed clams. I wonder if that thing makes coffee at the same time. How much further you think he can push that jalopy? You mean by day or by night? I'd say by night he'd go a quarter of a mile with a good strong tail wind. I can't understand it. We've got plenty of speed, plenty of truck. Why, we'd be glad to take his load in, wouldn't we? Yeah we would. Only now it'll cost him half of what he makes - and a little bit more. - Oh, that's awful. You mean the longer he waits, the more the inflation. (Loud chatter) Hello, Polly? Hey, fellas, hold it down, will you? It's long distance. Calling Fresno. Thanks. Hello, Polly. Quiet, fellas. The guy wants to talk to Polly. (Nick) Can you hear me, Polly? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, get your bags packed. Nicky did great. Made a killing the first time out. Oh, Nicky, I'm so happy for you. Daddy, it's Nick. He did wonderful. Yes, how wonderful? Oh, excuse me, Nick. I was talking to Daddy. I know what he wants to know. Tell him, but tell it to him easy. Four thousand bucks. Four thousand bucks? She'll come. Of course I'll come. Polly, come up here right away. We're gonna be married today. (Shouting) (Man) Polly, come right away! Ask your old man when the next train leaves. Tell her to fly. This is the 20th century. It's faster. Polly, why don't you fly? It's faster. She can catch a place to Frisco and be here in two hours. Yeah, you catch a plane to Frisco. You'll get here in... (Laughing) No. Get off at Oakland, catch the ferry. I'll meet you at the Ferry Building here. Nicky... Do you love me? What? Yeah... - Of course I do. - Bacigalupi, you love me? Antonio, you are my life. I give you a kiss. Polly, I'll meet you in the Ferry Building downstairs at ten o'clock. Hey, if a guy named Ed comes in, he'll ask for me. Tell him to wait. (Nick) Hey. - Where you going? - Home, to bed. - Bed, my eye. I wanna buy you a drink. - Why? I wouldn't have six and a half bucks a box for my apples without you. I just wanted you out of my room. Take it easy. I told you, I wanna buy you a drink. A while ago you were falling asleep. And now you're like a jitterbug. If you'd made 3900 bucks on your first deal, you'd jitter too. Come on. Hey, what's that face doing down there? Come on, smile. This is a good-luck day. Hey, hot it up, hot it up, let's have some jive! - You got anything better than that? - What would you like? - "Apple Blossom Time"? - No. "In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree"? "lda, Sweet as Apple Cider"? - What'll you have to drink? - Apple cider. - Where'd you dig him? - (Rica) Whiskey, Shorty. We drink to luck. - Good for him, bad for me. - Whiskey you'll get. What do you mean, bad for you? - Don't you know? - No, I don't. I thought you were going to be my boyfriend. To your bride. Tell me. Does she have pigtails down to here? You know, Italian-American, a cat's a cat. You mind if I don't discuss my girl with you? That's right. In such company, who can you talk about? Me! I never had pigtails, see? Let her have them. Money. That's what I want, lots of money. Sousa. I have to say Polly's name again. Polly and I have one thing in common. - She loves money too. - I don't wanna talk about it. Stupido, she marries you for your money. Give him the bill. He likes to pay. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that about Polly. - I'm sure she adores you. - I wanna tell you something. Nobody could pay her to pick me up. Keep walking. I'd pick you up anytime for free. You know that, lover. Come on, I'll take you home. I often walk here. - I like those noises. - You don't care about the noises. You like to walk here because in a spot like this - you can be yourself. - What am I? You're not the dame handing me that stuff at Shorty's. - You're just a scared kid. - Oh, no. You hang around crummy joints, stay up all night know a slug named Figlia. Who are you fighting? You're only taking it out on yourself. (Laughing) What's breaking you up? What's so funny? Isn't that sweet? He wants to save me. Go ahead, lover, tell me what a bad girl I am. I'm lost unless you save me. - I don't care. I'll never see you again. - That's right, never again. Kiss me goodbye. Goodbye, lover. Nick! Frenchy, you're a beaut. - It was in this pocket, I know it. - The girl. She got it. (Screams) (Whistles) Rica. Rica. Oh, Nick. I looked everywhere for you. What they did to you? - Give me my money. - Nick. Before you lie - I saw you pick up my wallet. - Yes, I did. I did so Mitch and Frenchy wouldn't get it. - Give me money, or I'll kill you. - Nick. It's true. I took the money. But they caught me and took it away. Figlia. They did it for him. They work for him. - Figlia. - Oh, no, no, amor. The way you are, you can do nothing. Wait till your friend comes. Ed. He'll help you. Ed. (Engine rattling) Well, that's it. Listen to him now. Sounds like he's dragging cans up that hill. What keeps that crate together? Get up. Get up. I think he can. I think he can. I knew he would. Well, I'll be... He's sure stepping on it now. (Slob) He's going 55. He's climbing right up. (Screeching) Hey, his drive shaft's busted. (Screeching) That guy's got no brakes. (Pete) He'll get killed. Hey, watch it! - You are Polly Faber? - Yes. I am Rica. Nick asked me to meet you. - How nice. - How do you do? We go to the market. It's only a minute out of the way. Nick and I are looking for a friend. Come, please. If you don't mind my asking, what's Nick doing in your room? - He's resting. - Oh, I hope he's comfortable. - I hope he's... - Yes, he's comfortable. I hope I'm not intruding. - I wonder what I came up here for. - I thought it was to get married. Hey, fellas, I ain't got no time. Make up your mind, will you? You paid Nick 3 bucks. What's the matter with us? I like his personality. Besides, he got here first. Hey, Joe. Leave them on the truck. Hey, what do you want? This market's closed. You want two bucks? - OK, take them off. - Three hundred bucks. By the way, where's Nick? I don't know. He picked up with some dame. He don't know what happened. He'll die when he finds out. Yeah, it's too bad. A fella tries to make a buck and... that's all. Poor guy breaks his heart to bring us some apples. I'll never forget it. There's the guy... - Nothing. - Yeah. That's a shame. - You say his apples weren't burned? - Not a scratch. Crime they're going to waste. - Well, that's how it is. - Hey. Yeah? - Skip it. - What's on your mind? What'll you pay if I bring in those apples? - I wouldn't want you to... - You said yourself they're wasting. They can't do him any good laying out there. Maybe you're right. I'll give you half a buck a box. - What are you guys talking about? - Three hundred bucks more that's what. - What are you? Grave robbers? - Quit crying. Let's get them. - They'll only lay out there and rot. - Pete, you seen that guy burn. - Yeah, maybe he's right. - You ain't fooling me either, Figlia. You want those apples. That's what you're telling him. - Standing there like Honest John. - Listen, you slob. And you know what? There's the guy to go get them for you. Give me my share. If you ever see me again, you better be on the other side of the street... Look, you want them? - Why not? - OK, I'll get them. How do you know he won't run with the apples? Hey, lock up. Unload fast. We're going with him. I told you Nick was fine, but he isn't. He was robbed last night. They beat him up. What? They hurt him badly. But he's much better today. Hey. What do you mean, robbed? Yes, it's good you came. He needs you. They stole all his money. Nick, Nick. Hello, baby. Hello, Nicky. You two want to be alone? Help yourself. I'll take a shower. - Where did you pick her up? - She picked me. It's a pleasant surprise, finding you in her room. Where did you want me to be? In the gutter with my head busted? - She took care of me. - Why...? You are hurt. What on earth happened? I had a little trouble, but I'm all right. Poor darling. I'll take care of you. Oh, Nick, aren't you excited? I can feel my heart pound. Where are we going to stay? I'd like to stay at the Mark. We'll have to wait three days, though. It takes that long to get a Iicence. Nick, I quit my job. Walked in and told Bently, "Bent, you stick-in-the-mud." Well, you should have seen his face. Darling. We'll have to be careful with our money. Did Rica tell you anything? Why, no. Is there anything to tell? Oh, Nick, I'm so proud of you. You did it. I thought you couldn't, but you did it. - There's something I ought to tell you. - Yes, anything wrong? Well, I... Polly, I... It's hard for you. Is that it? For one thing, your partner Ed walked out on you. For another, you made $4000 like you said on the phone but somebody beat you up and took it. And of course, we can't get married. I don't suppose you have enough money to send me home. Or to feed me even. You see, I'm hungry. But I'd rather go hungry one morning than for the rest of my life. Aren't women wonderful? The difference between you and Polly, she's strictly an amateur. She uses a club, you use a knife. - How well you know me. - You said it, sister. You picked me up so Figlia could swipe my load. And you were so hard to get. - He gave you 100 bucks. - He did? - Well, did he or didn't he? - No, he didn't. He only gave 50. And that walk, where you like the noises. - That was to set me up. - Of course, sure. - Well, was it or wasn't it? - Whatever you say, lover. Any way you want it. Mitch and Frenchy, where do they live? Where do they live? New Bay Hotel. But don't go there. To them life is very cheap. Go to the police. Aren't you afraid if I go to the police? Go to the police. I can't figure you out. One minute you're... What do you want from me? I want for you not to be hurt. Nick, go to the police. Frenchy and Mitch, they have ways. They can kill so it looks like an accident. They will follow you all the way when you drive home. And if you get tired and want to sleep a little they will push your brake and make your truck roll back and to crash. - What did you say? - Yes, believe me. They did this before for Figlia. When he doesn't want to pay money he owes. I know. Nick, they will kill you. They will kill you in your truck. Nick. (Nick) Figlia. Figlia. - Hey, Figlia! - (Slob) Hey, hey. (Nick) Open up. (Slob) Hey. Even if you kick that door down, he still won't be in. How do you know? What are you doing here? We crossed you up, Nick. - We sold to Figlia too. - Where is he? - Do you know where he is? - Yeah. Well, where? Where? - He's out earning an honest buck. - Tell me. Will you take it easy? I am telling you. - What was your partner's name? - Ed. Ed Kinney. That's him. Figlia and Pete went out to pick up his load. Did Ed come in? - No, he didn't come in. - Did he send word he broke down? He broke down all right, but he didn't send any word. What do you mean? What do you mean? I'm trying to tell you. He cracked up at Altamont. His truck went off the road and burned. What happened to Ed? He burned too. Nick, Nick. If I'd tailed him, it wouldn't have happened. Don't murder yourself. We was in back of him. There was nothing nobody could do. What do you mean, Figlia went to get his load? That's what he's doing. Figlia's paying Pete four bits a box to take them apples off the road. Why didn't you go along? Didn't you want your cut? Four bits a box! Four bits a box. - Four bits a box! - Nick, Nick. Now, Nick. Nick, take it easy. Will you? (Nick) They'll rook you in the grave. Four bits a box. - (Slob) Leave him alone! Leave him alone! - Four bits a box! What a man, Figlia. He gets around. That guy crippled my old man. (Rica) Nick! Nick! - Oh, Nick, let me talk to you. - Leave me alone, Rica. Where in Altamont? - You know them hairpin curves? - Nick, Nick! Oh, please don't let him go! No, no, honey. Don't try to stop him. (Engine sputtering) All right. All right. Shove over, kid. I'll drive. Hello? Hello? Give me the police. Quickly, quickly. (Charles) OK. Set them up, Frank. (Figlia) Hey! Come on in. Take that booth. Sit down. A little business, a little pleasure, huh? Hey, did you get them all? Hey, Pete, it's a party. Come on. Drink it. Prizes. Go on, take it. You earned it. What are you gonna have, Charles? A malted. A bourbon malted! (Laughing) Pete, what's the matter? Why you ain't laughing? Hey, that's how I got my chest, laughing. See? It's good for the lungs. It expands. I can't laugh. This stuff is sitting on me. I got something to tell you. You're a truck jockey now. Know what you're gonna be when you grow up? A truck jockey. Huh? Hey, hey, how are you, buster? Come on in. Hey, you know what he's gonna be when he grows up? Secretary of the Treasury. Come on, sit down. Hey, two more drinks. How is it, buster? You know, Pete, you're not a good businessman. You got two bucks a box. Ask Figlia what he paid me. (Pete) You got three bucks, he told me. (Nick) Ask him what he paid. I'm asking, Fig. What is this? We're having a party. You gave him more than three bucks. Suddenly, I don't like the company. - I'm leaving. - He paid me six and a half. Suddenly, I like the party. I'm beginning to laugh. (Nick) You got no right to get rough, Pete. You agreed to it. A deal's a deal. That's right. You got your money, so shut up. (Nick) You got paid in cash. All I got is a lot of smoke. Sure, Pete. There's always a guy like Figlia to take you. But you... You're the kind of guy who plays both sides. You'll always be taken. Listen, you got your money. At least 10 witnesses know you got it. That's right. I gotta shut up. Pete's gotta shut up. How about Ed? How about Ed? Four bits a box. How about Ed? You're crazy. You busted my hand. And does my pop have to shut up? You cut off both his legs. Put your hand on the table. Or I'll crack your skull. - Put it down. - That's enough, kid. That's enough. I want to hit him for my pop! Sit down and watch. It's a party, ain't it? Floorshow. You rotten drunks! They'll pay for anything they break! Take it easy, pop. Take it out of this. (Figlia) I was... I was gonna pay your old man. I was gonna show you the check in the office. Take the cash. - And the dough you rolled him for? - I'll make good. Here, I'm paying you, see? Take it all! I'm paying you. Take... Take... Why don't you take your money? Why don't you...? Take... For my pop! For my pop! For my pop! Nick! The cops! All right, mouse, which one? - Him. - Who roughed him up? I did. Was it your old man that lost his legs? Yeah. That was my old man. OK, beautiful, come on. Look, mister, that don't give you licence to beat up people. You can't take the law in your own hands. Taking care of guys like Figlia is our job. Now, cut them. You must be careful of the next lady you meet. She wants your money. Blonde or brunette? Well, she looks very much like me. (Laughing) And now you, your future. (Nick) Excuse me, fellas. She's with me. Hello, Nick. - Are you all right? - Yes, thanks. Thanks for everything. - It's all right. - Come on. - Where? - With me. - But, Nick... - I like the way you wear your hair. I'm worried. (Man) Hey, what about my future? I don't know about your future. But here, maybe you can read mine! (Laughing) You better practice saying "I do". When we get to Tracy, we're gonna be married. - Is right? - Is right.
