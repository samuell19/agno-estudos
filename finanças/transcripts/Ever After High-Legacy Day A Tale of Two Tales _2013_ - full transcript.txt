(high vocalizing) (birds twitter) In a faraway land... (thunder crashes) I am Raven Queen, daughter of the evil queen. And I pledge... - Um, I... - Come on, do it. I... (sighs) Male Narrator: All eyes were on Raven as she faced the most important choice... - (record scratches) - Female Narrator: Really? You're gonna start there? At Legacy Day? Male Narrator: You know there's only really room for one narrator here. Female Narrator: Start at the beginning, where the whole Rebel and Royal drama began. Male Narrator: Oh fine. Gather 'round, friends, and let us tell you a story, the story of Ever After High. (giggles) (sneezes) Male Narrator: A high school for the teenage sons and daughters... - (grunts) - of the most famous fairy-tale characters... - (ribbits) - who ever lived. Whoa. Male Narrator: But this year was like no other - (bleating) - for the students of Ever After High. It was the year of Legacy Day... - (chirps) - a momentous event where the students pledge to all the magical world to follow the same paths as their fairy-tale parents. Female Narrator: Which they better do, or else. Male Narrator: I'm sorry. Who's telling this story? If you don't... Would you two stop fighting? Peas and crackers. Um, who are you talking to? Why, the narrators. Oh, you can't hear them, Raven. Only I can. - Okay. - (gasps, giggles) - Can I talk now? - Mm-hmm. It's just... I'm sick of everyone thinking I'm so evil because my mom was. It's not fair! No one thinks you're evil. Now you're just talking crazy. - (mimic bell) - The daughter of the Mad Hatter calls me crazy? (sighs) Would you stop with the worry flurry? Everyone at school loves you. It's Raven Queen! Run! She is evil! Run, everyone. - (bleats) - (screams) (doors slam shut) See? They love you. (watch rings) (sproinging) Yay! Tea time. - Earl Grey. - (squeaking) Oh, you clever dormouse. Why yes, this is a new dress. Male Narrator: And so, life for Raven was not easy, feeling alone and isolated. Female Narrator: As it should be. She is destined to be evil. Male Narrator: Couldn't go 20 seconds without talking, could you? Hey, Raven, uh... You look gort. I mean great. I... I don't even know what gort is. I'd offer you a seat, but I'm evil. To sit here, you'd have to be pretty... - ...daring. - (girls cheer) Oh, Daring. (cheering continues) What? No, Raven. I'm Dex. Dexter Charming. Daring's my bro... ther. Oh, gort. Raven, how's every enchanted thing? Apple White, good to see you. Hey, Daring. I, uh, have to warn you. Don't stare at the teeth. Just got them whitened. - (bell rings) - Oh, oh, there's the bell. Time for Good Kingdom Management. Raven, what's your next class? Uh, History of Evil Spells. (giggles) That is so perfect for you. Hey, Cerise, how's it going? (growls, clears throat) Oh, uh, sorry. I... I have a cold. Free food! Male Narrator: That night as Raven returned to her dorm, she found quite the surprise waiting for her. Hey, Maddie. Welcome home, roomie. Huh, good one, Apple. I'm rooming with Maddie this year. Not anymore. Since you're such an important part of my story... You poison me. I fall asleep. The prince wakes you with a kiss, blah blah blah. Yada yada, I know. So? So I asked Headmaster Grimm if we could live together. And he said yes. Isn't that enchanting? Uh, but... but... Oh, oh, oh. You are going to love rooming with me. I'm thoughtful and beautiful and I sing the most wonderful songs about woodland creatures. (clears throat) ♪ Oh the doves love to fly And the hares love to burrow. ♪ Move along. Move along. Nothing to see here. And I already decorated your half of the room. Apple: Isn't it just the evilest? (giggles) I knew you'd love it. This is gonna be a long year. (bird coos) Male Narrator: Which brings us to the rehearsals for the Legacy Day ceremony. So when your magical key appears, you insert it gently into the Storybook of Legends, then stand shoulders back and declare your destiny to the world. Have I made myself clear? Headmaster Grimm, but what if... No questions? Good. Now, we're going to practice with this tiny manual of entirely reasonable school rules. (grunts) Milton Grimm: (clears throat) (bleats) Who will go first? I, Madeline Hatter, pledge to follow the destiny of dear old Dad, the Mad Hatter of Wonderland. - (kettle whistles) - When do I drink the tea? Milton Grimm: Next! I'm Hunter Huntsman and I pledge to follow my destiny as the next Huntsman. I'll swing my axe bravely and... (blowing raspberry) Really, Pesky? You want to play that way? Milton Grimm: Next. I'm... I'm Cedar Wood and I pledge to follow my destiny and be the next Pinocchio. Well, I mean, not the next Pinocchio. I mean, actually, I can only tell the truth while I'm in school, but then one day... one day, I'm gonna lie. Uh, but does that mean that I'm gonna be like my dad or not like my dad? Milton Grimm: Next. I'm Raven Queen and I pledge to follow my destiny as... Um, I have a question. What is it? I was just wondering, I mean, what if I don't want to take the pledge? (gasps) (gasps) What? It's just a question. And here's your answer. If you don't pledge your destiny, your story ceases to exist. Ceases to exist? So then what happens to me? You will cease to exist. Poof. Now, Raven, continue. - But, Mr. Grimm... - Poof, poof! Um... I have to go. (crowd gasping) - (crowd mutters) - What about her destiny? Milton Grimm: Now, settle down, everyone. Male Narrator: In the Vault of Lost Tales, deep beneath the school, another was listening. (crazy laughter) Male Narrator: Giles Grimm, the brother of the school's headmaster. The Raven flies. The clouds, they sing. But what should happen when the tide roles in? (sighs) Male Narrator: What will happen, indeed? Female Narrator: Are you done? Can I tell my side of the story now? Male Narrator: If you must. Go on.. Female Narrator: In a faraway land, all eyes were on Apple as she made the most important declaration of her life. I am Apple White, daughter of Snow White. And I am ready to pledge my destiny. - (crowd cheers) - (record scratches) Male Narrator: Of course you'd start with Apple, always playing favorites. Start at the beginning of the school year. Female Narrator: Oh, fine. Gather 'round, friends, and let us tell you a story, the story of Ever After High. - (grunts) - A high school - for the teenage sons and daughters... - Hmph. of the most famous fairy-tale characters - who ever lived. - (growls) Female Narrator: But this year was like no other for the students of Ever After High. For it is the year of Legacy Day, a momentous event where the students pledge to all the magical world to follow the same paths as their fairy-tale parents. I can't believe it. Legacy happens this year and there is just ever so much to do. Totally, right? I mean, this year's after-party is gonna be a page ripper. - I heard D.J. N-Chant is... - Briar. It's not just about the party. This is destiny. Future queen! We can't let anyone post embarrassing pictures of us on MyChapter. Hey, daughter of Sleeping Beauty. If I'm gonna be catching "z's" for a hundred years, I got to live it up now. And come on. No one would post anything bad about you. Everybody loves you. It's Apple White. (sighs) (sighs) Gorgeous. (bleat) Tiny: Can I carry your books? Why, Tiny, aren't you the sweetest little thing? Thank you. See? They love you. Oh, oh. I don't want to miss a minute of our first day. - Hi, everybody. - (happy murmurs) Briar: Hey, what's up? Howdy. - (laughs) - Hey, Prince Daring. Um, why are you holding your hand over your mouth? Well, you see, I just got my teeth whitened. And Headmaster Grimm said I can't show people, 'cause... But your smile is so charming. - Well, you know... - Ah! My eyes! I can't see! Ah! - Tiny: I'm okay. - (laughing) - Apple, Daring... - (clicks tongue) So any juicy dating details for my mirror-cast show? Talk to the mirror. Blondie, Daring and I are still not a couple. This is high school. We've got "forever after" to be together. But you two are the perfect couple... not too this, not too that. You're just right. Come on, Apple. Let's go get some lunch. Charm you later. Oh, oh. (giggle) Female Narrator: And so that night, back in the Ever After dorms, Apple had a surprise waiting for her new roommate. You think Raven's gonna like this? Of course. What future evil queen wouldn't love... an evil throne, an evil crown, and an evil haunted mirror? True, but why are you doing this for Raven? Because she's such an important part of my story. When she poisons me, it changes everything. Then the Prince can wake me and I become queen. That's when I get my "happily ever after." I need her. - Raven: Hey, Maddie? - (knocking) Uh, quick, hide. I don't want Raven to know you helped me. I'll go out the window. I've never done that before. (giggles) Whee! Welcome home, roomie. Huh, good one, Apple. I'm rooming with Maddie this year. - Not anymore. - Huh? Man! - I am good-looking. - Whee! Daring, how'd you know I was gonna be here? Catching damsels in distress... it's kind of my thing. Well, that was a total rush! Stay here. I'm going again! (giggles) Hey, you want to get a Hocus Latte? Uh, that sounds magical. I love mine with nutmeg. - How do you like yours? - Oh, I like a lotta, lotta, lotta, lotta, lotta cream. (giggles) - Hey. - Hi, Ashlynn. Want to go on a nature hike later? I haven't been in the woods in days? And it just feels so good to get back to what really matters. (goose honks) I got a shipment here of 300 new shoes for the Glass Slipper. New shoes?! (squeals) Where? (honks) (geese honking) (gasping and giggling) It's a shoe thing. Well, she is Cinderella's daughter. (bells chime) Ooh, time for our Legacy Day rehearsal. I can't wait for everyone to get a glimpse of the queen I am going to become. (goose honks) (giggles) Female Narrator: But what Apple didn't know was that Raven Queen had other plans... Male Narrator: That would change the world - for the better. - For the worse. So when your magical key appears, you insert it gently into the Storybook of Legends, then stand shoulders back and declare your destiny to the world. Have I made myself clear? - But what if... - No questions? Good. Who will go first? Ooh, me, me, me. - Mm, ah, ooh, ooh. - Step right this way, my future queen. I am Apple White. And I pledge to follow my destiny as the next Snow White. - Perfect. - I know. I am Briar Beauty. And I pledge to follow in my mom's footsteps and sleep for a hundred years. But before I do, I'm gonna live every minute! Ooh, speaking of which, my dorm room Friday night, we're gonna blow the roof off the place. Milton Grimm: Next. Hey, there. Charming, Daring Charming. I pledge to be just like my old man, King Charming. Brave, good-looking, kind, good-looking, thoughtful, and good-looking. - (clicks tongue) - Next. I'm Raven Queen. And I pledge to follow my destiny as... Um, I have a question. What is it? I was just wondering, I mean, what if I don't want to take the pledge? (gasps) (gasps) She has to do it. I mean, if she never poisons me, then I'll never fall asleep. And I'll never be kissed by my Prince. And I'll never become queen. And I'll never have my "happily ever after." Now, Raven, erase that dangerous idea from your head. Continue. I have to go. - What? - Hey, what about her destiny? The rules... I mean, the rules! Female Narrator: And so Apple took refuge that night in the enchanted forest, - (cries) - wondering what would become of her destiny should Raven not follow hers. (gasps) Headmaster Grimm? Forgive me for startling you, my dear. I need you to keep an eye on your roommate, Raven. We must follow the paths set out before us. It's the only way to keep our world safe. Please, watch Raven and convince her of this. I know you'll do whatever it takes. I'll... Female Narrator: And so... on the grave portent about to befall Ever After High... Male Narrator: Must you always be so dramatic? Female Narrator: Must you always ruin my ominous endings? Male Narrator: You're always taking the Royals' side. Female Narrator: I mean, I'm known for my endings. Female Narrator: And so here we are... Legacy Day, where the students of Ever After High signed the Storybook of Legends, pledging to follow the paths of their fairy-tale parents. Male Narrator: Or not. Female Narrator: Seriously? I'm narrating here. (sighs) Maddie, you have to help me. I don't feel like I can sign the Storybook of Legends, but I don't want to let everyone down, either. And do not forget the whole, "If you don't sign, your story disappears. Poof! And you may vanish into oblivion." (gasps) That's a thing, you know, and it's gotta hurt. But we don't know if that's true. - But what if it is? - But what if it's not? - But what if it is? - You're not helping. Wait a tick. ♪ I think I know who can help! ♪ No, but see... I am totally a Royal. (locker door slams) Raven! There you are. We have to talk. Come back! Apple, where are you going? I have to convince Raven to sign the book. My destiny depends on it. (breathing heavily) (knocking) (gasps) (door opens) Raven? (echoing) If anyone knows the truth about the Storybook of Legends, it's Giles Grimm. Feathers and friends, together, alone. He's speaking Riddlish. He was cursed with a babble spell. Makes him sound. you know, bru-ru-ru, cuckoo. He says it's nice to have us here. Ask him about the book. If I don't sign, am I really gonna... disappear? Mm-hmm. Can a musical chair change its tone when the tablet of granite is inscribed with a bone? Hmm. The king who sings with pages of sky fears too much the dawn that rises with lies. He says there's something wrong with the book, and that if you don't sign, your story... will... What? What?! (splashing) Oh, sorry. If you don't sign, your story will continue. Ah, really? Oh, that's great. I think. Uhh! You think? Hey! Riddlish is not an exact language. Female Narrator: At last it was Legacy Day. Next we have Apple White. (cheering and applause) I am Apple White, daughter of Snow White, and I am ready to pledge my destiny. (clicking) (cheering and applause) (lips smacking) And next, Raven Queen. (thunder crashes) I am Raven Queen, daughter of the evil queen, and... I pledge... uh... I... Come on, do it! (sighs) (clicking) (gasps) Ohh! I am Raven Queen, and I'm going to write my own destiny. My "happily ever after" starts now. (shattering) Oh, no! (murmuring) (cheering) Yay! Raven did it! (sighing) I'm still here. I didn't disappear. How could you be so... so selfish? All: Boo! All: Yay! I'm sorry, Apple, but I... oh! Ahh! Hold everything! (booing stops) Raven: Ohh... I didn't know I could do that. (gasps) I'm sorry, Apple, but I don't want anyone to tell me who to be. I want to figure that out on my own. And don't you understand? I'm not the only one who gets to choose their own destiny now. We all do... even you. But I don't want to choose a new destiny. I liked the one I had, and because of you it might not happen. But it might. (sobbing) I don't know. I... I just don't know. Wow! You're still here. No poof, poof, poof. Yay! I know. It feels good. Male Narrator: Life between the Royals and the Rebels at Ever After High would never be the same after Raven stood up for what she believed. Female Narrator: What she believed was wrong. She didn't honor her destiny. She tempted fate. Listen, narrators, we are trying to have a nice moment here. (giggling) (thunder crashes) Raven does not know the forces she has released. This must be contained before her dangerous idea spreads. (evil laughing) (thunder crashes) (fairy-tale theme music)
