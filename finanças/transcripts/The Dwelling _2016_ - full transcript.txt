All units. Fire at 11 Fullsome Street, The Anarchist Sex Club. People may still be inside. - What have we got? - We got five DOAs inside, some mess. - What is this place? - Registered as a private event space. But basically, it's a sex club. Clients come here when they want the night to keep going, I guess. - Who are they? - Some of the victims from room 18. This is from earlier tonight, about 3 am. We're working on identifying these three here. The owner says they came in together, caught a show and got a room. So they went to the show then checked in to room 18? Yup! The last person who checked into 18 was Ensler. That was three months ago. Ensler, yeah! Killed her husband. Gouged his eyeballs out too. Suicide here a year ago as well. Same room. - I don't remember that. - You were on leave. So why weren't the victims signed in last night? Not sure. Let's find out. Get background checks on all these. Which ones then? There's like 3 years worth here. Yeah well? - Get someone else to do it then. - Right. - So what did you think of the show? - Yeah, it was interesting. Yeah, she was good, right? Seriously? Seriously. Till somebody tells me to stop. Hey! Put that out! - I think she meant today. - Can't you just book a regular hotel? We're already here for her things, so I just figured why not, right? Here she is! You did a great job. That was amazing! Thank you. - So you're telling me there is no room? - Nothing. - There's nothing available. - Come on! Hi! - Hi! What's your name? - Elsie. Elsie. That's a really nice name. I called in earlier and I spoke to somebody on the phone. They made me aware that the room with the emperor size bed was available. Yeah. No, sorry. - Why is it not available? - It's just not. It's being renovated. - What? Just not or it's being renovated? - It's just not. Honey! Okay. Look, Elsie. It's my birthday. You know... And... It would mean a lot to me if... you can make an exception... one time. - 200. - Okay. - Total, right? - The room's 180, so total 380. Have fun. Thanks. Nobody is telling you have... Then why did you come in the first place? Hey! Put your fucking arm down! What? I like you. How about me and you get a bedroom? Hey! Woh woh woh! Actually you know what, man? I checked with the front desk and they said they're all out of rooms. Alright? Dickhead. Have a great night. Let's go! Let's get this party started. Hey! Maybe you pump the brakes a little next time. Look! I don't need you to manhandle me. I can handle my own. Bet you like it better when I do it. - Is it a storage room? - No, it's not a storage room. You know, it's under renovation. Smells like stale bread in here. It's filthy. It's not filthy. It's just a little bit of dust. Okay, I get it. Could you just be more optimistic? It's a $ 380 room. It's a $ 180 room. I love the viewing options. If you want your bed night to happen, try being more subtle. That's pretty awesome. - Hey, I just won a 100 bucks. - That's great. - How are you feeling about this? - That's fine, Fred. It's you I think. It's not just for me and Ren, it's more of our thing. Sure you're okay if your best friend see me naked? It's gonna be dark. - You shouldn't work out for her? - Are you really doing your makeup for him? - Well, it just sounded weird... Well it makes you feel better we can have a safe word. Safe word? Yeah! If you weird or uncomfortable, just say the word and shut it down. - Sure, I know what a safe word is. - Cool. - What is it? - Aardvark. Aardvark? Say that if you feel weird or uncomfortable. Okay. Aardvark. Okay so... We're all sleeping in the bed tonight. Why don't we just get in and have a little drink first? Yes! That's cool. Yes, let's do that. - What do you want us to do? - I ahh... well... Why don't the two of you share a kiss? Okay. It's your birthday. I love birthdays. Hey! Are you okay? Are you okay? Sorry. Ooh! A figure just passed over a second there. What do you mean? I do not know... Uhh... But you are okay? Right? She's okay. You're alright. You're okay. Everybody's fine. It's good. You know what? I think I'm done. No, no Sandy. You're not done. You just shake it off... You know? Show's over, Ren. But show's not over... - Well, why not you two dickheads make out? - Oooh... Dickheads? - Will it turn you on? - No! I guess I'm just tired. I'm tired. Awesome. I spent $ 380 on this room. I told you we should have booked a regular hotel. Hey guys. Oh look! Who's back. Where have you been? Well, you don't take holidays? More like time for bad behavior. - How did the fire start? - Like a gas leak. Probably a little cigarette. And boom! - Smoke knock her out? - I don't think she died from smoke. Every bone in her body are shattered. - Someone beat her up? - I can't find any bruises. We got four bodies and one in the hallway. Two of them under the bed. One male one female. So this one falls asleep with a cigarette? And both burned to death. But one of them is... under the bed. Rocky? Fred! Who are you talking to? Hey boy! Fred! Well you're freaking me out. How are you here? Fred! Don't let go of my arm! Don't let go of my arm! Fred, look at me! Don't let go! No! No! Fuck! Fred? - What happened? Is Fred okay? - Fuck, I don't know. I don't know... - We gotta go get help. - No no no... don't get off the bed. There's something underneath there, I don't know what it is but... Just don't get off the fucking bed. - Does anybody have their phone? - No. Fuck! Help! Help us. We are in room 18! Room... 18. - Room 18! - Room 18! - Did you guys just see that? - That just actually happened? We're in big fucking trouble. Ren Debrowski, 25. Lives in Ann Arbor. String of DUIs when he was a teenager. Lost his license at 18. Killed a five-year old a year later. Drinking and driving again. Got six years probation. He's been eviscerated. By what? I don't know. Hey! Stop right there! Someone stop before he gets out. Hey! Hey! Stop! Elsie, what the fuck happened? Why were there people in 18? Elsie! Get somebody to get a mop and a bucket to clean this shit up before it stains. - Who are you? - I'm the owner. Who the fuck are you? Hands! Put your hands up right now. Do it! Behind your head! Do it! Fuck you motherfucker! Babe! Babe! Calm down. He was trying to get away from the fire. The autopsy is in a couple of hours but... we swabbed his throat. Pretty sure he didn't die from the fire. What the hell was he trying to get away from then? If I can get this key under the door, maybe someone will come in. Have you ever skipped a stone, city boy? Well. Not recently. Nope. You got it. Come on... We wait okay? He was like a brother to me. I'm so sorry, Ren. Guys, what are we gonna do? I don't know. We can pretend like we give a shit. - Excuse me? - "Excuse me". - What's your problem? - What do you mean what's my problem? For months all I've been watching is how you don't actually give a shit about my best friend. I loved him. Love him. Get fucked you loved him. I loved him. Ren, just take it easy okay. You know what? I'm freaking out right now. So fuck you for saying I didn't love him. He didn't mean it. He did. He's an asshole. Fucking douchebag. What? What is it? What? Oh shit. Where is everybody? Ren, come back! Stop! Babe! Ren! Ren! What's inside me? Get it away! Get it out of me! - Do you know any of the victims? - No. You ever have any trouble here? Rowdy customers? No. - This isn't a great chat. - I didn't know who they were. And I don't often have rowdy customers. It's a hell of a bed. Yeah, it is. You're Virgil Carter, correct? Yeah. I've read about you. Sorry about your daughter. Thanks for coming. Hey, Ellis. We've identified the guy in the hallway. Allan Duke, 33. Charged with sexual assault in 05, no conviction. The girl who he assaulted hung herself a month later. We're still working on IDing the others. Keep me posted. What are we going to do? Don't look at him. Look! Gonna get out of here, okay? We just have to be... be robotic about this. Otherwise, we may freak out. Get ready. - Help us! - Please. We need help. Did you hear? Help us! We need someone to call the police. What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you deaf? Go call the police! What the fuck is wrong with you? Can you hear us? Hello? What kind of kinky shit is this? Should we invite him to come play with us? Ask him. We are bored. You wanna entertain us? Oh come to the bed, come play with us. Nancy, there's something wrong with him. Okay. Let's play. What the fuck! What's wrong with him? Jesus Christ! What is this? I heard a story once, when I was a kid. I heard about this guy who's like... like a shut in. And... he was scared to leave his house because he thought if he did then... then the devil was gonna kill him. If he stayed inside, then he would be okay. All his friends and family, you know, they like begged him to leave. They even got a psychologist then to try to talk him out of it, but nothing worked. Then eventually like a month later, his wife decided to put sleeping pills into his food. You know just knock him out and then like put him in an institution or something... And when he wake up and see that he was okay, get over it. They had him in a gurney outside, everyone was thrilled. The paramedics walked away like for like two seconds to open the ambulance doors. Right then, out of nowhere, a drunk driver hits him. And he dies. That fucking sucks. Well... at least he died in a sleep. It's Fred's phone. Here, use this. You got it? Hurry up, Sandy. Sandy, hurry up. You got anything yet? Hurry up! Okay! Yes! Pull it in. Hurry up! - Okay, got it? - Hold my leg. Pick it up! Call 911. Fuck! "Call the police! I'm in trouble!" What does that mean? "Call the police! I'm in trouble!" "Call the police! I'm in trouble!" "Who is this?" Oh my God! "Sandy Miller. I'm at 11 Fullsome St, Rm♪ 18. Call police." Sandy, what's going on? "Well that's funny because I'm in room 18" Who are you texting? What? I should mention that it's an arrestable offense to interfere with a police investigation. Sandy, what is it? What does it says? Oh shit! I think it's a cop. Really? - "Are you a cop??" - "Yes." "Please help! I'm serious! I'm in Room 18!!!" Fine. "PROVE THAT YOU'RE IN 18" - This is Virgil. - Hey Virgil. What's up? Hey, can you trace unknown text? Bring in the phone and we can see what we can do. Might take some time though. I'm gonna call you back. "Sandy." Anything I can do for you? - Just you? - Pretty much. The others are out questioning the neighbors. - Can you get this partial to the lab? - Yeah, I can do that. - Are you going to do that now? - Well, no problem. Oh, I understand. - My pleasure. - Thank you. You fucking guy. Sandy! I don't want to be alone. Okay. I'm awake. Do you remember the story you told earlier. Ren was in a drunk driving accident in high school. He killed a little boy. He has this nightmares about it all the time. Maybe that's why we're here. Justice, or something. Eye for an eye... Why are we here then? Why are you here? Are you okay? Sandy, I'm really scared. - Everything is gonna be okay. - I just don't know what's happening. - Yeah? - Hello? - Sandy? - Yes. - Sandy, what time have you got? - 4.05 am. Well, it's 6:00 am here. - Are you fucking with me? - Are you fucking with me? No. Can you leave the room? We can't get off the bed. Look, I am completely sane and everything... but if we get off this bed... we'll die. Who else is there? It's just the two of us. The others are dead. Fred and Ren. Hold on... some guy in the hallway. I need to ask you something. Do either of you... Do either of you have a ring which's got a heart with a crown on it? Yeah, I do. Why? There's a fire, Sandy. I need you to get off that bed. We can't. It won't let us. I've seen what happens. I don't know how to help you. Well, do you know what started the fire? - I'm trying to figure that out. - Do you know when it started? I would say around 5.00. Did we make it? Sandy? I'm trying to find the silver lining in all of this. Okay, please tell me. I'm not supposed to be here. Yeah. Neither am I. No, I mean like... alive at all. What do you mean? I was studying to be a doctor... King University. Shit. Were you there when the shooting happened? - Yeah. - Oh my God. A good friend... He protected me and died. I'm sorry, I just... never really talked about this with anyone. Even after everything it's kind of like shit. It's so hard. He was aiming at me... But Jake died instead. I wish it had been me. I miss him. I never even used to drink before this, but it's a hell lot cheaper than therapy. You finish up. You know that's my story and can't help but wonder maybe that's why I'm here. Okay well! I mean, speak for yourself. I didn't do anything wrong. I am innocent! So... I don't know about you but I don't want to die. I want my life. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Now look... we're gonna get through this which is... have a little patience and wait it out okay? I'm so sorry. You're right. What's that? - What? - That! Is that you having sex with Fred while I'm sleeping beside you? - What? No. - Look! There is nothing there. Nancy, it's not real. - Don't fucking touch me! - Nancy! It's fucking with you. Why is it all in my head? Why isn't it in your head? Why aren't you seeing that? I'll tell you why. Because you're making all of this up. You're making this happen somehow. - What? Come on! - None of this is real, is it? There aren't any dead bodies. You're just fucking with me because I'm fucking high. - Don't! - Don't fucking touch me. I'm going home. Nancy! Stop it. You were the one who told me. It's all in my head. Don't! Sandy. I'm really sorry. I'm gonna go okay. Don't! Oh shit! I'm sorry. You're okay. Get out of here! You know I may be freaky, but I sleep fine at night. I bet you do. What about you, huh? You’re the famous detective Virgil Carter. You don't know anything. What do you know? I read that article about that black kid you killed. He was 18. Oh sorry. That black man you killed. - I was acquitted. - Right. That's right. I read the statement. "I was scared. I thought he had a gun. I thought my life was in danger." That's right. I also read... that your daughter was killed a week earlier by a gang member. Happened to be black. You didn't get a gang member, did you, huh? You just killed some kid. An innocent kid. He was just on his way home from work, right? He wasn't even in a gang. - Hey. - Hey! Yeah, hey. Partials came from Sandy Miller, 24. She was at the King University shooting. Guess her fiancé was killed trying to protect her. And interestingly enough we did a background check on Doug Ensler. Sexual assault. Did five years. Doug Ensler, the husband? The Ensler who checked into 18 three months ago? Yeah. Registered pedophile. His wife obviously found out. Revenge maybe. - Where is Kari Ensler now? - Plainsberg Women's Correctional. Okay. Thanks. He doesn't like you, eh? No shit. Questions. Were you drinking when you murdered that kid? What did you say? - Were you drinking when you killed... - You fuck! What in hell are you doing? - Just asked him a couple of questions. - Shut up! Go home! - Wait. Listen. - You're not needed here, Virgil. You're off this case and you're drunk as shit. Go sleep it off. Listen! Yeah. I'm listening. Hey Virg! You can't stop it man. This is some biblical shit. It's above your pay grade. Hey. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Listen. Some weird shit is going on up there okay? Okay. And I'll keep you in the loop okay. But you shouldn't be driving. Fuck off. I'm okay. No no no! What the hell is wrong with you, man? I can help her. Okay she's alive. - Okay. - I'm counting on you, Ellis. She's alive. Okay. Come on, you gotta get out of here. Alright? Hey. I like your ring. Thanks. It's a Claddagh ring. Jake gave it to me before he died. Apparently you only suppose to give that once in a lifetime. To your soul-mate. That's nice. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. It's okay. I think I know why I'm here. Why? My mom had cancer. She was in a coma for a long time, totally unresponsive. Her bones had become so brittle, they would snap when the doctors tried to moved her. They had machines breathing for her. So eventually we... had to make a decision. I went to visit her in the hospital the day before the doctors were supposed to... you know, pull the plug. She woke up. Just for a minute. She told me that she felt fine. There was no pain. I went straight to the doctor to tell him not to pull the plug and... on the way there, I changed my mind. Why? I got pregnant when I was 16. My mom didn't want me to keep it. She yelled at me and yelled at me. She called me a slut. She told me she would disown me. Cut me off. Eventually... I caved. I've hated her for ever since. Soon the opportunity arose... I took it. I know now... she was just trying to protect me. And right when I was supposed to be protecting her... I did that to her. I did that to my own mother. Mom? Mom? Nancy! Nancy. Please don't go. - Come with me. - Mom. Come on. Don't leave me. Let's go. Nancy, don't go. It is okay. Mom? Mom? You have a visitor. My name is Virgil. - Nice to meet you. - You too. - Should I have my lawyer here? - No. I don't want you tell me anything you don't want to. I just want to hear your side of the story. I need you to tell me what happened. You won't believe me. I've seen some incredible stuff this morning. Do try me. Why the club? Why did you guys go there? I don't know. Spice things up. Was that okay? Don't break character. I'm sorry, what did you say, honey? Everything's fine. You can beat harder if you want to. - I got to pee. - Okay. Fine. Honey? Kari? Honey? Honey? Honey? Honey, what are you doing? I didn't do it. But you touched the bed and walked away from the bed? Yeah. I am a good person. I didn't kill my husband. Do you believe me? Completely. Thank you. You know. He was being punished for what he did to that child. He was being... punished. Hey baby. - You okay? - Jake? What is this? I'm here because I wanna be with you. Do you want to be with me again? Yes. Good. But I don't want to end up like them. You won't. Just stay on the bed. I'll see you soon, baby. How? Please. Don't leave me! - Sandy. - Hi. Are you okay? What's going on there? I'm good. - I'm going to go now. - Where are you going? I'm going to end this my way and taking the bed with me. No, Sandy. I've figured it out. You can get off the bed. Nothing is going to happen. It's okay. I understand everything now. Sandy, why do you think you were able to contact me? That's to give you a choice, an out. Because you're innocent, Sandy. Just get off the bed. Everything is gonna be alright. I am a bad person. Jake died because of me. That's why I'm here. Jake died protecting you. That was his last gift to you. Okay, Sandy? It's too late. I start the fire and I die in the fire. And the bed will burn. I have to go now. If you kill yourself... you'll have the blood on your hands as it needs to take your soul. That's how this thing works. That's what it does. I don't know what to do. Everyone around me dies. I should have been the one. Sandy... Sandy no. No! You were never the one. Sandy look. I have a daughter. I had a daughter. You know there's not anything that I wouldn't do to see her. Not a day that goes by that I don't think of her. Sandy, you have friends and family who want to see you again. You are really loved by many people. Sandy please. I wouldn't lie to you. Who is this? Hey, it's Virgil. What the hell is this? What are you talking about? - Where are you? - I'm at the club. We're at the club. What room are you in? 18. What are you talking about? I'm in 18. Virgil? I... I don't understand. How... How can I help you? Virgil? Virgil? Virgil, are you still there. Virgil? Virgil! Don't be scared. Just keep your eyes closed. Ladies and gentlemen, the highlight of tonight's sale, Lot No. 13.
