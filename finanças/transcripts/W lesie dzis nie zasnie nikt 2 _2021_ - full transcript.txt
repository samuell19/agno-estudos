NETFLIX PRESENTS Party's over. You saved me. My hero. I love you. SERGEANT WALDEMAR Hello? So, why haven't you been answering the phone? Oh... I didn't hear it. What's up? On your way to work, stop and buy two hot dogs. - And also grab something to drink. - All right. One with mustard and ketchup, the other one with, uh, Thousand Island dressing. Yeah. Uh, okay. Anything else? No, that's it. All right. See you. GROCERY STORE Hey, there. Orange juice... Orange juice. Uh... I'll get two bottles of orange juice and two hot dogs. One with ketchup and mustard, and one with Thousand Island dressing. I'll bag it up. And how much will it be? Twenty zlotys. I can't believe this. What the fuck are you doing? Get out! Here's 20 zlotys. One more thing. There is this thing, it's called the, uh, the Animal Rights Protection Act and it started in August 1997. If I see you kicking a dog or something like that one more time, I'll be taking you to the station for a different kind of talk. You understand? And we'll see how brave you are then. You can fuck off. Uh... POLICE Hey there. - Hey. - Um, I bought you some orange juice. Hmm? Uh... I don't like orange juice. Oh, right. RESTROOM Howdy. - I brought the groceries. - Oh, yeah. Hmm. With mustard and ketchup. Thousand Islands. - And two bottles of orange juice. - Right. Are these fresh? Uh, it... it was made today. What's going on? Did something happen last night? What are those things locked up? Can you tell me anything, sergeant? Yesterday, that girl came here. The one in there. You saw her in the stall next to them. She was bloodied and dirty and had a really strange look in her eyes. And she started talking some bullshit about meteors or meteorites. And she said all her friends were killed, that they were murdered by those fat guys. Later she killed said fat guys as revenge, one of them supposedly with a machete, the other she supposedly ran over with a car. I say "supposedly," because said fat guys are also locked up in there. So we drove over to the cabin to inspect things and we met one of the fat guys. So, we brought him in. About an hour later, Mariusz and his brother brought in the second fat guy, because they ran into him. So, yeah, in the end, uh... we have a few corpses. This includes a policeman from a neighboring district. It doesn't fucking really make much sense. Do you get it now? Oh, wow. Yeah, wow. Should we call regional headquarters? Well, maybe I already did that. The Regional? Metropolitan. Do you have a problem with what I'm doing? No, no, no, I'm just asking which one. Metropolitan is good too. What did they say? They said that they're sending Special Forces from Warsaw. Special Forces? Yeah, fucking Special Forces. What, don't you know what Special Forces are? No, I know about Special Forces. - When are they coming? - I don't know. Uh... At night? In the morning? Some archbishop has a birthday party today with some ministers and the Special Forces are protecting said ministers. HIS MIDDLE NAME IS POWER Do you have any other questions? So you and Wanessa managed those fat guys together? - Yeah. - But they're so huge. Well, you know, a couple of hits with a baton, a jolt with a Taser, and we got them under control. Hey. Do you want some? It's water. Hmm? I'm Adam. I'm one of the police officers here. Yeah. Zosia. Mm-hmm. I overheard. Thank you. If you need anything, you can always call out and I'll help you. Okay? Lock this back up. Let's go. Get up. Turn around. Hands, please. What's going on? We're going to the crime scene. Come on. Lock up. Listen. Give me those notes from the interrogation. And my hat, please. When you're finished the report, send it to Warsaw. You don't want me to come? I could help out a bit. No. Finish the report and go home. Come on. GOD, HONOR, HOMELAND Come on. Go. Come in, please. Please, come in. Get in there. Can you not hear or something? Please go in. Get in. Come in and tell me exactly what happened. Tell me everything from the beginning. Uh, who came in first? Who was last to come in? How exactly did you get in? Did you touch anything? Did you take anything? And when did you go down to the basement? Uh... go. Miss Iza, she was our guide, she came in first. ”Miss Iza was first.” All right. Uh, where did you get the machete? Or did you get the knife with which your friend was stabbed in the stomach... uh, Jurek? Julek. So? Oh. Oh, oh. Turn around. Turn around! Sit down. Sit. Sit! I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Oh, fuck. Fuck me. Hello? Hello? Zosia, where are you? - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's weird they're not back yet. Don't you think? Yeah. Call Waldek. - You've reached the voicemail box of... - Hmm. It's switched off. Or he might not have cell service. I'll radio him. Come in, Sergeant Waldek, this is Adam Adamiec. Please answer. Over. Sergeant Waldek, please answer, it's urgent, this is Adam. Over. Sgt. Waldek, is everything all right? Over. He's not answering. All right, maybe you should check on him. I'd rather not go alone. Well, I haven't finished the report. Then I can wait for you. Fucking hell. Come on, Wanessa, why are you getting so angry? There's some official safety rules, aren't there? And there's this, uh, article in the health and safety regulations that says, uh... Move your ass. Should we flash the lights? I will. I like how... um... You look really pretty. Just saying. Hold the light. Sergeant! Waldek? Waldek? What? Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, fuck. No. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Let's go back to the station. Let's go. Let's go. Leave me alone! Wanessa. Do... Do you remember what Waldek said? There's a Special Forces squad coming from the capital. Then let's go back to the station, wait for them, and come back when they get there. - Let's go. - You're such a loser! Uh, loser? Uh, no. Special Forces aren't coming until later tonight or tomorrow morning. Do you understand what will happen? More people are going to die by then. Calm down, we're the police, aren't we? We can't just wait around for backup and hide when that murderous bitch is running around here. We have to catch her! - But why are we catching her? What for? - What the fuck don't you see? There are handcuffs, she's not here, the sergeant's dead. - Come on, Adam, use your fucking brain! - But... Don't you get this is your job? It's our duty. Remember what you swore? Huh? "To serve and protect the citizens with your life." No, it's not about what I swore. Waldek is fucking ripped in fucking half. You don't have to do anything on your own, it's not Miami Vice. Let's go! - We'll wait for them and come back with... - Don't touch me! I'm sorry. But I... It's dark out and we are alone. We won't make it. We are not alone out here. There's the Territorial Defense Force. According to the cards, what I see here is... Mm-mm-mm. It's not just the legs, I think. It's something much, much worse. I think it might even be a brain tumor. Jesus! So I guess I should see a doctor. No, no, there's absolutely no need to see a doctor. Let me tell you, Jarosław, there are special ointments made by me with the best herbs, with ginseng... Wanna get that? ...which are the best for all ailments. Thank you very much for that. I just wanted to ask one more question because my feet hurt sometimes. According to the cards, I see it might be because of back pain. Hello? Hi, we need you. It's... Uh-huh. - There's been a bit of a situation. - Uh-huh. Uh, the murderer broke free and she killed Waldek. Okay. Get your gear, we gotta go. I think people used to be more human. When we were analog. And now? All this technology just makes us feel so damn alone! Just so alone! And frustrated. It's all people do now, spend time on the Internet, on phones, on computers, and comment on others! Nowadays that's the most popular sport: engaging in internet hate! Fucking hell. There are no values, feelings, tenderness. Nothing. Back in the day, we had respect. And now? People jump down each other's throats. Down throats! Because of these text messages. Uh! Uh! Fuck! Uh! Uh! Uh! Well, fucking hell. And if you don't add the right emoji to a text, ooh, someone will get fucking offended for something that was supposed to be a joke, or they won't fucking understand what you meant! It's sick. The world is sick. But I will heal it. That's why I established this camp. Because I will not stand for all of that. Adrenaline! Right. That's very true. I can't argue with that. What is that? Is this some camp prank? What prank? The camp is empty right now. They're all on a trip. Something must have short circuited. By the way, that leopard print... Mwah! I'll be right back! Hurry up. Fucking hell. Robert? Ah... Oh, fuck me. Huh? What the fuck is this? Ow! Fuck! What the fucking fuck? We made it. She went that way. Over there. That's that offline camp for kids. How do you know she ran straight ahead and didn't take a right or left turn? - Please don't butt in. - We'll follow the tracks. We know about this kind of thing. Let's go. - Courage, fraternity, responsibility. - Hmm? - That's who we fucking are. - #Territorials. No, this makes no sense. Come on. That's an order. This is a death wish, Wanessa, going into the woods after someone who kills people. You should've chosen a different job. Yeah, I'm starting to regret it. What was I thinking? We should have like three, ten times more people for this. Especially with these guys. Oh, shut up! We should have a searchlight. A searchlight? Quiet! She ran through here, get the trap. Light. When our little runaway gets caught in this... she won't get out. All right, she ran through here, but how do you know she'll be coming back this way? She'll get lost and go back the way she came. And she either runs into us or the trap. Or, for example, that things that wolves do, observe the hunter, circle around him, and follow after his tracks. So the hunter thinks he's following the wolf but in reality, it's that the wolf's following him. So then a bear trap like this... is the perfect thing. But she's not a wolf though. What do you know about working in the field? Hunting? Tracking? You know nothing. Set that thing down, 20 meters east. Adam. Hmm? I already told you, if you don't have anything smart to say, just keep your mouth shut. You're just irritating. Six, seven, eight... nine, six, one. Two, three, four, five, six. seven, eight. Hmm. Men. Mariusz! Sławek? Sławek! Jesus Christ, Sławek. Hey, fucking hell. - Sit down here. Under the tree. - What? Sit him down. - Sit down! - Ow. What? - Settle down. - Oh fuck! Jesus, man, you don't have... We need to, um... bandage it somehow. All right, hold it. There. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Enough, we're going back. We have to go back. I'm calling an ambulance. But are we... Are we close to the camp? - What? I don't know. - Uh, it's the same distance. Maybe closer. - Sławek! - Hello? Hello? Constable, it's Adam Adamiec from Baranów. We have a friend... a friend has both his hands cut off and we need... To Camp Adrenaline! - Yes, to the camp. - Hey, don't fall asleep. Come on. To Camp Adrenaline. Yeah, thank you. - All right, ambulance is coming. - Hey, come on, get him up. - Come on, let's go. - Help him. - All right. - Here, help your brother! Here, here, here. Now! - Where is Mariusz? Where is he? - I'm here. Take those maybe they can sew them back on. Ew... Hey, wait up! There. Over there. Hold on, brother. You'll be in the hospital soon. Hello? Ow... Oh fuck! Oh no! What now? What are we gonna do now? Shut up! Let me think! "Let me think"? My brother is dying! I know! Hold him. Hold him. There should be a first aid kit. With a red cross on it. Shut up! I'm the only person here that can figure this out, understood? Figure out what to do with my brother if you can figure stuff out. - Hold on, hold on. - Shut your face! Got it? I was talking to my brother! - What was that? - Let's go to the cabin now! - What? - Inside! To the cabin! - What? - Open up! Open up! Fuck! There! Put him there. Here. Careful. Here. Hold on, brother, we'll fix you up. Bro, a fridge could come in handy. Get something to put under his head. Here, here. Lay him down. Adam. Careful. What was that? What did you see? - Adam! - Huh? It... it... it was her. That girl, Zosia. But she looked like... She looked like... Like... Like what? Like those fat guys in jail. And... and... and she... And what? I don't know. Do you mind? Janeczka? Wanessa! What are you doing here? Adam... Listen, I was here with Oliwier. And then the light went out and he went to check it, and I heard something like... something like... I don't know what the hell that was. I got scared, I didn't know what to do. I got into this wardrobe and I've been there for an hour. Hi, Mariusz. Hello, Janeczka. What are you doing here anyway? There's some psycho that escaped from jail and... It's one of the girls from this camp. But the bitch killed the sergeant. Waldek? Yes, so we've been tracking her for a couple hours now. Jesus! What accident? Sławek, he... ...he was trying to set some trap and he cut his hands off and... Sławek? He's not breathing. Sławek? Sławek? - I'm taking Sławek home. - No! What do you mean, home? - I'm taking the ambulance. - You're not going anywhere. We can't leave here. Let's wait for the cavalry. What cavalry? Uh, Special Forces are coming from the capital. Oh! I was just thinking, why aren't we calling the police? But you are the police, so who would we even call? But they're coming later this evening or in the morning. - Waiting makes no sense. - Everything makes no sense! - I'm going back. Adam, help me get him up. - How about no, Mariusz. Mariusz, we have to finish what we started. My fucking brother is dead. Finish what? And who's to blame for that? Huh? We should kill the bitch! We're armed, trained. We can do it! All right? Right now we have the advantage. - We don't have the advantage. - What are you talking about? We need to barricade ourselves in here. Let's sit on our asses until morning. - What kind of policeman are you? - A responsible one. You're a fucking pussy! All right, I'm going now. - No! - You're not going anywhere. - Don't tell me what to do! - I will, because I'm the police. And stop fucking talking bullshit. You're crying like women, both of you. Everyone, we need to stop arguing right now! How 'bout everyone minds their own business? How about we listen to the highest-ranked police officer? Hmm? You're just a senior constable! Give me a break. We must decide these things together. We need to agree in the face of a crisis. We need to be above any divisions, do you understand? Exactly. - Oh, look, a smart-ass whore. - Hey! Don't call me a smart-ass! - I call things as I see them. - I'm not a thing. I may be a whore, but at least I'm a free one. And you? Who the fuck are you? A Polish patriot, with a swastika on his chest. How dumb! I may be dumb... at least I don't have HIV! I don't have HIV. And you have a tiny dick, so there! - What'd you say? - You heard me. - Stop! - Stop! Get off! No! No! No! No! No! People! What are you doing? If we want to survive, we need to stick together. That's where Janeczka is 100% right. Because if we get divided, or if we split up and everyone goes their own way, one left, one right, you take the ambulance, you I don't know what, then... then we'll die! You know? Have a little... Just be kind. Kindness, that's it. Empathy. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. Your dick's not that small. Sorry. Then I'm sorry as well. And... and from now on we stay together, right? This is us. And here's the ambulance. Here's that big tree. Here's the tents. This is the plan. We set an ambush in strategically good places. Me next to the cafeteria. Adam, you're on top of the ambulance. Mariusz, you're in the tent. We set an ambush. And we wait. From these places, everyone will have a good vantage point. We wait, and send the bait to the middle, in the open. Like during a classic police sting. And the moment that the target appears, the bait hides, and then we shoot at her from these three sides and... that's it, the case is closed. Yeah, I know you'd like to hide and be rescued like a fucking puss. - And if our target doesn't appear? - She will. How do you know? Let's call it police intuition, okay? Trust me, it will work. - So I'm here, Adam's there. - Mm-hmm. You're there. She'll get caught. But who's going to be the bait? No. No, I won't do it. Over my dead body. Sorry, my bad. Janeczka. Where are you going? Mariusz isn't there anymore. Stay where you are. Stop moving! Go back to your position. Wanessa! Wanessa! Mariusz! Wanessa! - What are you doing? - Let go! - What? Don't just shoot blind! - Let's chase her! - Let me go! What are you doing, you prick! - That's it! Let me go! No! Get in, we gotta hide. Didn't I fucking tell you, barricade ourselves in and wait? But no! Nobody ever fucking listens to me. Nobody listens to me, and why? Because Adam's a pussy? Adam knows shit? Police hunch? Police sting? There goes your sting! Janeczka and Mariusz, dead! Fuck! Mariusz is dead too? Don't you think if he was alive he would've helped somehow? He would react somehow? Maybe shoot something? I can't believe this. You're all bark. You're just a hothead. Like a cobra in a skirt or something. The Messiah of the Polish Police. What did it get us? Fuck all! Fuck all! - Stop shouting at me. - Fuck all! Everyone is dead, you understand? And we're gonna be next! I'm sorry. All right, I'm sorry as well. It's just that I'd like to keep living my life, you know? I want you to keep living too. Okay? Okay. We can't keep doing that, we need to be more reasonable, okay? I'm sorry. Ah! Hi. What is happening to me? How come I know how to speak this language? I will explain everything to you. This is senior constable Kowalczyk, over. Do you copy? Please come as soon as you can, I'm fucking begging you! Sgt. Waldek is dead, everyone is dead. Can anyone fucking hear me? It was a piece of the Moon that once fell from the sky. This elemental Evil oozed from the rock and went inside me. And now it's also inside you. That's more or less what happened. Now we are the bad guys. We are monsters. We kill people. Wow. And why do we kill? Well, because we are monsters. That's not really a very complex motivation. It's our nature. Instinct. With every passing minute, you'll feel it and understand it more. And you will discover yourself anew. It's cool, you'll see. Besides, evil is a subjective notion. People are evil. They have it ingrained in their nature. Their species should have been annihilated ages ago. And we will fix that and kill them. Because we both hate humans. But... they can't all be evil. The world is a good place too. The world? Was the world ever good to you? It wasn't good to me. Are you okay? I think so. And now... do I also have your strength? Do I have any special powers? So... what now? What now? We go out and kill. But... just anyone? Can we... choose someone? If you have anyone particular in mind that you'd like to kill, that's awesome. How was it? Awesome. First, he got a glimpse of me, then he turned around, and I wasn't there anymore! He'll never know if it was his imagination or not. Just like you wanted, right? So, you like it? Oh, yeah. You see? I told you. With every passing minute, you'll feel it more and more. Instinct. Yeah, it's cool that since we are the bad guys now, and that we do what we do. And that we can build up some suspense first. Scare them a bit. Sure we can. I even thought about letting out some sort of scary roar, but I somehow didn't manage to. Like this? Exactly. More from your belly. You'll get there. Okay, let's go and kill that bastard! He deserves it. What did he do? He is a bad man. A real, genuine dickhead. Then we should rip his head off or something. How do you want to kill him? Maybe with a knife. Classic style. That's cool too. All right. Let's go cut off his electricity. Quiet! Hush. Wait. The wardrobe. As soon as he looks in the cabinet, we jump out on him. And if he doesn't? He will. They always do. We just need to... There! Fuck. Jake, you little dickhead, shut the fuck up! Fuck me. So how did... my baptism of fire go? You are amazing. So are you. Can I ask you something? Of course. Why me? Because... as soon as I saw you for the first time, I got this feeling... that you and I... are very much alike. And later it turned out to be true. Basically, it was as if I saw myself in your eyes. Thank you. For what? Well, mostly for... For making me feel like I've finally found a place for myself in this world. Shh! The doggy. Aw... Kill it. Come on... Okay. What's next? We'll free the fatties, they might be useful. We have a lot of work to do to launch an apocalypse. First here, locally, and then, who knows? Ah... Come on. Look, that's my office. Come on. Hey, get up. You are free. Why aren't they getting up? I hate that bitch. I'll take care of her. Adam, fuck! Adam... No... Kill her! No! No! No! I can't do it! You have to kill her right now! I can't! Here, a souvenir. Since you liked her so much. I didn't like her. It's not about that. So what is it about? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing? You men are all the same. But I... love you. You don't! If you did, you'd have killed her. Don't say that. You know what? You are weak. A cheater and a liar. Think about your behavior. What are you talking about? What did I do? FLAMMABLE MATERIAL Hmm.
