Solange! Calm it down, guys! Who'll read today's poem? Solange. Solange? What's wrong? A few months earlier Can you manage it? There. Thank you for my present, honey. We have to go out there. Not now... Not now. - White wine? - Please. Thank you. Solange! Romain! Help me. Can you get the napkins? Here. Solange, make some room. It's heavy. - That OK? - I think so. Anything missing? The champagne's there, but hurry as the ice is melting. Can you help me serve? Impressive. Your attention, please. Thank you all for coming. It's our 20th anniversary. Today. Yes, don't look surprised. A speech. I confirm that: 20 years. The first time I met you, Aur??lia... Our first years, just the two of us... Then the birth of Romain, 21 years ago. A serious little boy, brooding, often anxious and hard to make laugh. Our years with a little boy and then, the arrival of Solange. Merry, turbulent, noisy even... That's Solange. That's Solange. A brooding son, a daughter full of life... They're our children, who are nothing like us. Children we definitely had together, Aur??lia and I. Children that are like worlds, worlds totally apart. Enough, Dad. Thank you for coming. STAGE DOOR The Good Soul of Szechuan Here. Nice make-up. It brings out your eyes. Finally! Sorry. Where's Solange? With your mother, as usual. Come on. Let's hurry. Maybe I'll have a Bloody Mary. What's that? You don't know? A cocktail of tomato juice, vodka, celery and tabasco. Is it nice? It's tomato juice. I was crap at the start of Act 2. I can never nail that line. "How can I be sure that I'm a good person?" I feel it coming, panic and screw up. I think everyone noticed you screwed up. Everyone? Are you sure? We'll ask Antoine. I'll never sit next to Solange again. What's wrong? Surely I can move a bit. Stop squabbling. Try it. She squirms like she's at home. Solange, you see the dentist on Saturday. Romain, check your shots before you leave for Madrid. No way. I won't go. You must be dreaming. Shots for Spain? You see the dentist, and you get your shots checked, OK. OK, whatever you say. Tonight's show reminded me of that Goldoni play when I was 8. You hadn't been born. Mum did the whole play in Italian. In Italian? And you managed to understand? It wasn't easy as I was so young, but Mum was so good, you didn't need to speak it... What's your dad doing? Who's he calling? He'll catch a chill out there. That's a brave sweater. - It's cool, huh? - Yes, but I'd never dare wear it. - Lili has one like it. - She's brave too. Gather around. Pablo, turn the light off. All right... We used to think light spread instantly. We now know different. The idea that it took time to spread was put forward by the Italian, Galileo. We know now light spreads at a precise speed. If the sun were to die, we'd only see it after a certain delay. Remember how long that delay is? 8 minutes 20. That's right. Solange, start the experiment. Can I try it too, sir? We can't possibly avoid it. We can't avoid it? That's not the problem. So what is? - Stop shouting. - I'm not shouting. Stop that right now! Flapping flight is the most common form. It follows a regular beat. It comes naturally to the chick in the nest that uses it spontaneously to demand food from its parents. The second form, gliding flight, is the simplest form, using very little energy, consisting of a slow fall. In the third form, soaring flight, the bird is carried along as it moves in a circle. Remember to work on your papers for next time. Hello, ma'am. I don't like what he's playing, but he's cute! - Here to help us, Solange? - Yes. Hi, Gina. Antoine, the St Nazaire customer will be here in 30 minutes. His guitar's in the workshop with the bill. I'll be back at 2 pm. I ordered your pizza. See you later. In this song, a little boy says he never knew his father. Even as an old man, he still thinks about him. A bastard, as they said then. Abandoned by his father. That's sad. It's just a song, Solange. A guy at school never knew his dad. A teacher gaffed, but he never mentions it. You know, your mother and I... we're arguing quite a lot lately. It's a rough patch. Things are all over the place at home, but it'll pass. It happens in every marriage. The eternal male-female divergence. Apparently, it exists. Where did you hear that gobbledygook? I don't remember. Stop fiddling with that radio, please, Solange. Did you hear what I said? Yes, Dad. It'll be OK. You mustn't worry. I'm not worried. I'm OK. Everything's fine, Dad. Thanks for coming along, girls. I have to rehearse now. For what, ma'am? Brecht's over. Didn't Solange tell you? Marivaux now. L'Ecole des M??res, a rare play. It's about a mother who forces her timid daughter to marry. Why force her? That's wrong. A "marriage of convenience". Mum's plays specialize in them. Don't show off, Solange. In the old days, mothers didn't always consider their daughters' happiness. - Can I come to see you? - Of course. Here's money for a snack. Thanks. See you later I adore your mum. Excuse me, have you got a light? Coming? It's just for a few days, Solange. Yes, Dad. Thank you, sweetheart. You can go back to bed now. Dad... Yes? Mum treated me and Lili to nail varnish. This isn't really a great time. Sorry, sweetheart. Can we talk tomorrow? Good night. Are you asleep, Romain? No. What is it? Dad and Mum are sleeping apart. It's just for tonight. Don't worry. Go to sleep now. You'll be beat tomorrow. A star is located at 750 light years from Earth. How many kilometres away is it? Explain. You have 15 minutes. No calculators allowed. What's up? My parents keep fighting. Yeah? I don't believe it. Do they argue? Every evening? Almost. Do they yell? A little. What about your dad? When mine moved to the couch, it was permanent. Really? They share a bed? Not anymore. But don't tell anyone. No one cares, you know. No divorce yet, but... Divorce? Are you crazy? Solange Maserati! This is a silent room. Your class book. Solange Maserati, class 4/2. The physics teacher sent me. Solange Maserati? Terrible writing. Spell it for me. M-A-S-E-R-A-T-I. - Where's that from? - It's Italian. We're Italian on my father's side. There's a make of car in Italy called that. Luxury cars. Know them? No, I don't. I haven't seen you before. I've never had detention. What did you do? I talked too much in class. Defend yourself or you'll get eaten alive. Put the phone away. I saw you. I was turning it off, sir. You saw everything. Was he using his phone? No, sir, he wasn't. You swear? Yes, I swear. Give me your report books. Double detention. You're as bad as each other. - You're Solange, right? - Yes. My mum named me after my grandmother. It's kind of outdated, but she loved my grandmother. You blush easily, right? I'm Arthur. Thanks for helping, I won't forget. I didn't do much. You play piano in the hallway? Yeah. When I'm sad, I start playing. It helps me dream. What do you play? Stuff I hear. If I like it, I play it. You're able to repeat it? You only play here? I'd like to play at home, but... I can't afford a keyboard. I'm sorry. That's life. See you, Solange. Stir yourself, talk to me! Stop running away and talk to me! Yes? Yes, this is Romain Maserati. I'd like to leave sooner than planned. I hope that's possible. Mum? I'm home. Had a nice walk? Yes. Coming down to eat? I'm busy. Solange! Mum, get up. Come and eat. Please, stop smoking. You too now? Solange! Tell Dad I can't come. Serve yourself, Romain. I'm not 5 anymore. Precisely. Mum can't come and eat as she has to learn her lines. She has a lot of lines and it's tough. I'm not stupid. I know she's sulking! Romain! It's me. What's going on? Romain, let me in. Get lost, Solange! Not now! I won't be far. Madrid isn't an ocean away. I'll come back. Come on, say something. It's sick, totally sick, you leaving like this. I have to go. Solange, go home! I'm going... Solange, go home! Yes, I'm going. No running in the corridors. What did I just say? C'mon, kiddo... A little quiet, please. Let's listen to Solange and Lili. You start. Today, we're going to give you a talk on Greta Thunberg. For us, Greta is the most important woman of our time. She's not just a woman, she's THE woman. OK, she's only 17 and some people find her ridiculous. Lots of people claim she's being manipulated. But we say... We say that's rubbish because Greta is our heroine. She'll save us from the end of the world! Calm down, girls. It's serious! We're heading for disaster and one girl can show us the way. And that brave girl is Greta. Who doesn't know Greta yet? Who? Hands up, we won't bite. Ciao la compagnia! Dad! He's gone out to run an errand. It's been really busy today. How are you doing? How was school? Is your Italian teacher still nice? Yes, Italian was cool. We worked on Pompeii. It's impressive. It's unbelievable how... I don't know... All the dead, all the statues... It's like a real village. I know. My parents took me once. I was scared, but excited too. It's disturbing to see two lovers who were kissing and were found like that. Solange? What's wrong? Why are you in my dad's sweater? Solange! Solange, wait! "For the bassist who cares about the look and sound..." It's not great. This is new. What do you think? Solange, answer me. What's on your mind? You're scaring me. Nothing, Dad. Heard from Romain? The rascal doesn't call often. He's far away now, Dad. Happy name-day, Solange! Are your parents going to spoil you? I hope so. Technology first on your name-day... Quiet. I don't want to know. For our trip to Genoa in April, I need two accompanying parents to supervise the two classes in years 3 and 4. Parents who speak Italian if possible. It's kind of urgent. Busy this evening? Not really, there's nothing planned. Want to come over? I have to see my dad about the Italy trip. See you tomorrow. - Have a good evening. - Bye. Your bag, miss, please. What a dumb thing to do. Was this for you? It's way too big. You've no bosom. You're not even a 32. You look odd in your photo. So your name's Solange Maserati. Please don't call my parents. I'll do anything you want. I have no choice. You're a minor, so I have to call them. Please, don't call my parents. I was stupid. I won't do it again. Please... Never again, I promise. All right, hurry home. Stop hanging out on the streets. - Hello? - Happy name-day, honey. Thanks, Mum. I'm thinking of you. Everything OK? Yeah, fine. How's the tour going? Do people like the play? Yes, it's going really well. I have to go now... Can we talk some more? I'll have to call you back. I have people waiting. Lots of love. "I have come, a calm orphan Rich with my peaceful eyes To the men of the cities. Who did not find me wise" I'm here, Dad. Why sit in the dark? I came back for something I forgot. - Everything OK? - Yes. Have you eaten? Where is that parcel? It's my name-day today. Mum called me for it, but you didn't. Forgive me. There's one girl on Earth who can eat a banana-split at any hour. And that girl is one I know. She's here. In front of me. My daughter. I'm a lucky man. Go on, eat, sweetheart. How's school going? Are you happy? It's OK. We're studying Verlaine in French. Know him? Verlaine, yes. Your mother recited him a lot when we first met. - Long ago. - I hate that. What? When you call Mum"your mother'. You never used to. Could you come to Italy in April with my Italian class? Yes, why not? We're going somewhere near Genoa. Levanto, know it? Levanto? Yes, I know it. A pretty spot. It's the home-town of Gina who works at the shop with me. You know, she's a good person, Gina. She likes you a lot too. How can I put it? I hope you're not angry with her. No, I don't give a damn. Don't be coarse, Solange. Anyhow, I won't live with you and Gina in your cramped apartment! Lili has to, with her father and stepmother. She sleeps on a sofa bed that stinks of old cats! No way! I'd rather stay at home with Mum, nowhere else. It'd be too sad otherwise. Way too sad. Listen, children and adults live in different worlds. I hope you understand that. Asshole! Give her hat back! I'll crown myself! Hello, everyone. I'm Mr Ruben, your new art teacher, replacing Mrs Lacroix who, as you know, is on sick leave. I'm glad to meet you. I hope to teach you things but, in return, I hope to learn from you too. Some people say that an art class is no use. But I hope to teach you that beauty is essential in life. Thank you for helping. Can you give me 20 euros to go shopping with Lili? Tell me, sweetheart... Do you know Gina well? Do you see her at the shop? - Gina? - Aur??lia... Your water. Yes, Gina. Yes, I know her. On a scale of 10, is she pretty? How pretty? Six? Seven? Eight? Nine? Your dress. When carbon combusts in dioxygen, the consumed reagents form a new product: carbon dioxide. Molecular models cannot explain how these products are formed. Another model was needed to understand chemical changes. It wasn't until 1811 that the chemist Avogadro distinguished between molecules and atoms. Molecules are made up of infinitely small particles, atoms. As an atom is a tenth of a nanometre in diameter, an electronic microscope is required. Solange, what's wrong? Are you dreaming? What did Lili just say? Hello, Lili. Hello. Remember me? I'm Gina. I work at the shop with Antoine. Have you seen Solange anywhere? She has basketball until 6 pm. Drat... Maybe the four of us could go to Madrid next summer. To see where Romain lives. There are some really neat rentals. No one says "neat" since the 80s, Mum. Really? Fancy that. If you did that, I couldn't take it! No blackmail, Aur??lia! We agreed! You push me too far. Screw no blackmail! - Stop! - Screw that! I'm going to Lili's! Stop it! Could I see the menu, please? How old are you? Sixteen. You look like a kid. Are you alone? No, I'm not alone. My brother's 21. He'll be here soon. - How much is hot chocolate? - 2.90 euros. Hot chocolate, then. Thank you. Hi, it's Romain, I'm not free right now. Call back later. - How much is coffee? - 1.20 euros. A coffee, then, please. Be here much longer? I'm waiting for my brother. Hi, it's Romain, I'm not free right now. Call back later. Romain, call me. I need you. Please! Mum, aren't you in bed yet? It's late. Was it fun at Lili's? Yes. We had pizzas. A Roma for me and a Neapolitan for Lili. And... her mother made... chocolate mousse and... an apple tart. It was cool cos... we had two desserts. And you? Sorry about yesterday. Mum took my phone. Punished all evening. It got me mad. What was wrong? It's over now. That Gina is a real bitch. And your dad's a son of a bitch. Open your books to page 234. Paul Verlaine. Who's going to read today's poem? Come on, don't be afraid. Don't be shy. "I have come, a calm orphan Rich with my peaceful eyes To the men of the cities Who did not find me wise" Who'll read it? Solange... "I have come, a calm orphan..." "I have come, a calm orphan Rich with my peaceful eyes To the men of the cities Who did not find me wise" Louder, I can't hear. "At 20, unfamiliar unease Known as the fire of love Made me find women beautiful They did not find me handsome Without a country or king And anything but brave I wanted to die at war Death did not want me Was I born too soon or too late? Why am I in this world? Believe me, my sorrow runs deep Pray for poor Kaspar" Hello, please leave a message. Mr and Mrs Maserati, it's Mrs Stein, Solange's French teacher. I'm calling about a minor incident in class today and I'd like to talk to you about it, so could you... Hello, this is Aur??lia Maserati, Solange's mother. Yes, hello. The thing is, your daughter started crying while reading a Verlaine poem. It was alarming. She cried? Really cried? Yes. Can we meet? You know it's forbidden to cry like that at 13. Can you hear me? It's strictly forbidden. Little Solange... In close-up, right in front of the audience. I'll show you what I've learned. The history of magic is wild. Heard of Houdini? No. What happened? Nothing. I'll tell you later. Houdini escaped from locked cages... It's really beautiful here. Mum and Dad were busy, so I did the cleaning. I have a surprise for you. Carlotta, a friend in Madrid, chose it. I hope you like it. Look at me. It really suits you. You're finally home! I'm so happy. Longer hair suits you. You're not too tired? I am, a little. Look at me. He's changed, hasn't he? - A lot. - Beautiful. Have I tanned? You certainly have. We're so happy. The maths teacher is great. He's young too. He likes to joke. But the biology teacher hates his students. He's an asshole. The canteen food is gross. The food is gross, so we eat in a local kebab place. Lucky you! Solange, your scarf. Drat. What an idiot... How has it been at home? Pretty good, actually. Sometimes, it was a bit... A bit what? How can I put it? No, the time soon passed. I managed, but you're here now. I looked at your master's course. I found lots of information... I've made a decision. I'm taking a gap year. I'm sick of slaving away. Right now, maths piss me off. I want to travel. Where? I dunno. Far away. I could join you. Not all the time. Just once. You won't notice me, I promise. I don't know yet. Don't tell Dad and Mum. - Promise? - Yes, I promise. Hi, Cosette. What's up? I was at the travel agent's. We're having a week in Sicily. Palermo, Syracuse, Catania... A new place every day. We'll go sailing too. You're close to your family? Well, yeah... What about you? I'll stay and party with pals. You know, I looked at keyboards for you as my dad sells instruments. I spoke to him and he might have a way to get you a good one cheap. Yeah? What kind does he have? Loads of models and brands. One's bound to suit you. Awesome. After the holidays? Promise? I'm counting on you. Romain! Get down here. Romain! The hotel beach looks good. Yeah, not bad. When are Mum and Dad due back? 7 at the latest, I think. OK. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. Pretty, isn't it? By the way, do you find me immature? Who said such a thing? The physics teacher at a meeting. What an asshole. I'm glad you're back, you know. Me too. Will we visit archaeological stuff in Sicily? I hope not. I hate that. I just want to see the sea. It's ages since I saw it. Hello, please leave a message. Mr and Mrs Maserati, it's Mr Gaumard, the estate agent. We already have a number of people interested in your house. We can arrange visits when you return from Sicily. I'm not pressuring you. When are you back? I can suggest a visit on Monday the 8th at 3 pm. I got champagne. Are two bottles enough? They play scopa in Spain. They call it escoba. The cards and rules change a bit, but it's fun. Are you OK, Solange? What's wrong? The estate agent called. The estate agent? What did he say? Did you know? They planned to tell you after the holidays. So... everyone knows but me. I'm going out to get bread. This is Br??ville Real Estate. Our offices are open from... Anna Pernot? That's me. Hello. The doctor's running late. He'll see you in 20 minutes. Solange... Solange... Solange Maserati? Yes, that's me. Sorry, my colleague's handwriting... Dr Benezky in five minutes, office N??6. OK. Your first time here? Don't worry, they're all really nice. Keep Friday's meeting at 2:30. Sorry, Solange, just a minute. Give Thibault the same medication until Friday, then we'll see. Talk to you later. I brought your book back. His point of view is interesting. But it lacks structure at times. It's not always well written, it's a bit hazy... But it's a good book. I didn't enjoy it as much as... - Nelly Ptachkina's? - Yes, that one. It was fascinating. She had so many experiences. And she was so intelligent for her age. I told my aunt about it and she's thinking of reading it. I'd like to learn Russian now. Do you know a teacher? I know a young student who could do it. Apart from that... Today's the big day? I guess... Who's taking you home? Aunt Anna, she's outside. How do you feel? I don't really know. It's hard to say. Remember the Grimm tale we talked about? The child hounded from home by a wicked stepmother, who turns into a bird and sings for his brother every day. In the end, he goes home. He has lived and suffered and travelled the world. I haven't done that. All the same... You left your family for a while. You lived with your aunt, far from your parents. And travelled in your mind, right? Yes. The little bird goes home and then? He goes home and turns back into a human, right? Yes, Solange. It's time to go home. Sure you want to go in alone? I'll be thinking of you. Call me anytime, OK? Don't forget. Hello, sweetheart. Welcome home. You shouldn't come back here. I know what I'm doing. I left that poster... Put it in the trash. In the trash. Nice and hot. Coming, Solange? Nice. What is it? A risotto primavera. From Naples. My first attempt. Next summer, kids, I'll take you both there. Next summer, I'd like to go to Greece. That wasn't planned. It's a personal thing. It's an eco awareness camp to clean a polluted beach. People are disgusting, dumping all their crap in the wild. The world isn't a trash can where you do what you want. It's crazy. Anyhow... It's a month-long project. - A month? - Yes. I can use my savings to pay for it. The idea is to take turns as leader. People come from all over, France, Italy, Germany... That's nice. Fine, if that suits you. Which weekend do I spend at your place now? We thought... this month, you could start living with Mum to get used to it and then... after... every other weekend with me. - And holidays are 50-50? - Yes. In theory, the first week is with me. And the second with me. How do I go from one to the other? We'll drive you, in turn. In turn? It's all well-organized. Who bought the house? Please, Solange, let's not talk about that. I just want to know who bought it. A family. Do they have children? Yes, two little girls. Are they cute? No, they're... hideous. Dad... Stop joking, please. Tell them the chimney blocks in winter and that the neighbour's dog barks a lot, but he's nice. They mustn't worry. Stop it. Before, you treated me like an idiot. I was the school idiot, then became the family idiot. I didn't want you to come here... I know, I wanted to come. To say goodbye to my home. Can't you understand? This is my home. I'm performing something totally new. It's really neat. Sorry, I said I'd stop saying "neat". I'm doing a Labiche play. "Drat! Her umbrella's a nuisance! I'll give the master's things a brush. Jacket, waistcoat, boots... They're all muddy. That's odd! Where on earth are his trousers?" It's not as classy as Brecht, but it's funny all the same. Will you come to see me? We'll see, Mum. You have to come, it's a comic play. You have to come. Aur??lia... Surely I can tell my daughter to come and see me. Solange, we wanted to tell you... About what happened... - Your mother and I... - Please, Dad, say nothing. That music... What's this cake? We ordered it for today. I went to fetch it. We hesitated between strawberry and chocolate, so... Dad, Mum... I have something to say. It took me time to understand. It was hard for me... to understand that you didn't love Mum anymore, Dad and that it hurt you. But you didn't love Dad anymore either. I understand now you don't love each other anymore. It's totally over. Don't be sad, Mum. Be cheerful now. Yes, it isn't easy living. It's hard and I didn't know. No one told me life was like this. No one ever told me... it was so hard. I'm going to try... I'd like to... You'd like to what? I'd like to try to live. To live and... I know it'll be complicated. I don't know if I can. I'll try. But we must be cheerful now, OK. Don't be sad. Never again, OK? There you go... 14 years old. And one day you'll be 15, 16, 17... Subtitles by Ian Burley
