PRODUCTION A KATSU PRODUCTIONS FILM ZATOICHI GOES TO THE FIRE FESTIVAL Produced by SHINTARO KATSU Original Story by KAN SHIMOZAWA Screenplay by SHINTARO KATSU TAKAYUKI YAMADA Cinematography by KAZUO MIYAGAWA Art Direction by YOSHINOBU NISHIOKA Original Music by ISAO TOMITA Edited by TOSHIO TANIGUCHI Starring: SHINTARO KATSU REIKO OHARA, PETER KAZUKO YOSHIYUKI KO NISHIMURA, RYUNOSUKE KANEDA KUNIE TANAKA OSAMI NABE, JUN NAGASAWA TOSHIE SHOJI, REIJI SHOJI MASAYUKI MORI TATSUYA NAKADAI Directed by KENJI MISUMI Excuse me, who's the daimyo making the procession? In the first half of the 1800s, one powerful yakuza boss built a massive organization by methodically seizing control over other yakuza bosses in the eight provinces of Kanto. Under the pretext of “honorariums,” the organization collected what amounted to illegitimate taxes from peasants, townspeople and merchants. In addition, the boss received as premium payments a percentage of the house cut from all gambling houses in the region. Thus, an enormous amount of money flowed into his coffers. People called this powerful boss Yamikubo, in other words, the shogun of the underworld. I will pay the honorarium. Please have mercy! I beg of you. Please! I beg you! You came all the way from Edo? No matter how unique she is, a man tires of the same mistress after a couple of years. I came to sell the old one and get a new one. Ah, my mistress is up on the block now. This beauty grew up amidst tea houses in Ryogoku, Edo. Untying her sash will make your hands tremble. Her snow-white skin is pleasing to the eye. Now, see this. There! What do you say? Hand in hand, you lie with her, and the tattoo will shudder and heave as she climaxes. At the touch of your skin on her skin, the goldfish tattoo will twitch into life. Take a good look and feast your eyes on her. Yes. It's my first time seeing a mistress auction. Your first time “seeing” it, eh? I hear 50 ryo! Do I hear any other bids? - 60 ryo! - I hear 60 ryo! Any other bids? Sold for 60 ryo! She fetched only 60 ryo. Did you lose money on her? Since at least 10 ryo will be deducted for fees. Don't just sit there with your finger in your mouth. Have this beauty suck on it for a change. Her dedication will impress you. She pulled out all her teeth to become better at “sucking.” They're all hussies. Oh, there's a beautiful woman. She has a nice figure and glowing skin. A real beauty. For this beauty, I'm keeping my mouth shut. In the year 1185 ‒ You can see, masseur? ...and warships of the Heike numbering in the hundreds were facing off along the coast of Yashima. The feat of Yoichi the archer is famed in the military epic Genpei Josuiki, yet even the arrowhead of the deadly arrow he held would not have gleamed as coldly as these eyes of hers. I won't say any more. I will add one more thing, however. She was formerly the proper wife of a retainer to the shogun. Now, let's hear your bids! - 50 ryo. - Are you joking? We're not selling her that low. The bidding starts at 100 ryo! - 150 ryo! - I hear 150! 160 ryo! 180! - 200 ryo! - 201 ryo! - I hear 201 ryo. - 201 ryo and 2 shu. Don't be ridiculous. Let's hear real numbers. 250 ryo! I hear 250 ryo! Any other bids? She's such a beauty. She makes me cry. - 280 ryo! - I hear 280 ryo. 300 ryo! 300 ryo? All right, I hear 300 ryo. Anybody else? Any other bids? Going once, going twice. Sold! Let's clap hands. Congratulations. Excuse me, sir. Could I have my massage fee? I'm sorry, but my fee is 23 mon. You didn't finish, you get less! This woman is mine! I own her! Woman, you're coming with me now... He's taking my woman! She's mine! Who the hell are you? Here, please sit. You narrowly escaped the clutches of that despicable fellow. But how did the wife of a retainer to the shogun end up in a mistress auction? I'm sorry. I completely forgot. I'm no monster. I'm just an itinerant masseur. Were you kidnapped? No. You must be feeling leery, finding out that a blind masseur rescued you. There's nobody here. Let's go. Idiots! They won't come here again. You're safe now. I'm tired. I see. Do you want to lie down? Let me make you a bed. Well, good night. Something is poking and hurting my back. It's my wallet. It shifted to the back. Damn, that hurt. Ma'am? Even if you had become that despicable fellow's mistress, it might have been better for you. You would have lived, at least. I'm hurt! I'm hurt! There, there. What's wrong? Don't cry. Good boy. Don't cry. All right, I'll show you how. Watch me. Thank you very much. Out of my way! Selling eggs, eh? You can't do business here. Why not? You just can't. We paid an honorarium with rice. Do we have to pay an honorarium for selling eggs, too? Today, my boss is having his name-taking ceremony. It's a special day for my boss. Do you understand? Please stop. Don't do this. Shut up! Please stop. Don't think you can get away with this! This isn't a show! You, blind man! Take this for mocking me! What? That's my wallet! Give it back! Hey! Ouch! You're hurting me. Take me to this boss having his name-taking ceremony. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. A gift of 20 ryo from Boss Shubusa. Ichi, it's good of you to come. Congratulations, sir. - Make yourself at home and enjoy. - Thank you. A gift of 50 ryo from Boss Abura. A gift of 10 ryo from Boss Zatoichi. That must be some mistake. My gift was one ryo. Don't concern yourself about it. But I do! All of you bosses have gambling houses. You have many underlings as well. When a game is held, you get a big cut of the proceeds. You also collect illegitimate taxes from the peasants. Your underlings are hard workers. So, 10 or 20 ryo must be nothing to you. But I don't own a gambling house. I can't squeeze money out of people trying to make an honest living. I earn what money I have by kneading people's shoulders. So please write down my gift as one ryo. Listen, Ichi. It seems you carry a constable's hook that makes good money for you. But all I have are ten fingers. Please correctly write down my gift as one ryo. How dare you repay my discretion by making a scene! I say, Ichi is your name? There's something to be said for living long. That was a good point you made. I'm humbled, Ichi. I am called Ichi. May I ask who you are? This man is ‒ It's a harsh world out there for a blind man. Even if he acts with total sincerity, the sighted don't treat him with respect. He must feel rejected sometimes. He might often refrain from saying what he wants to say. But you, Ichi. You're an admirable blind man. Why do you say that? Wait. Are you a blind man yourself? A blind man suffers many unpleasant experiences. But you know what, Ichi? The more unpleasant experiences I suffer, the more I can atone for the sins of my ancestors. That's what I believe. None of us can be good all the time during our lives. We must all have a couple of ancestors who've hurt somebody. In other words, all of us owe some debt to the world out there. So, it's like both you and I are paying back our debts. I see. That was such an enlightening story. I feel like I'm seeing things clearly now. “Seeing” things clearly, you say? Treat Ichi with respect. Yes, sir. I'm terribly sorry for making you wait. My fellow bosses, I apologize. Did you come here in a palanquin? Yes. I had been lying in bed because of my illness, and then I received a message about this emergency meeting. I hired an express palanquin and hurried over here. Condolence money. The mistress auction you held ended up a mess. You didn't show up for Boss Hokuro's name-taking ceremony. Now I see, however, what else can you expect from a gravely ill and bedridden man? As you're so frail, I doubt you'll be with us much longer. Take this condolence money and leave! Hey. Give him a respectful burial. Well, let's begin. At issue is what is to be done with Zatoichi. Make a mark on the tablet if you're against the proposal. Only one is against the proposal. Therefore, it's decided that he's to be killed. Showdown! Showdown! Five and one. Even! I won again. Thank you. You're on a roll. I'm winning so much at the game commemorating your name-taking. I hope you don't think me discourteous. I think I'll join in. Please do. Begin the next round, please. Place your bets. - Even! - Odd! Place your bets. Place your bets. Excuse me, sir. Place your bets. Anybody for even? Any more bets? - I'm sorry. - It's all right. Even. Could I place my bet with yours? Yes. All bets on the mat? We have a game. Showdown! One and one. Even! On! I'm so happy! I knew it would be even. Thank you. I'm glad for you. - Thanks to you. Go on and place your bets. I'm sorry, I'm leaving with my winnings. Thank you. Place your bets. Anybody for even? Place your bets. Here you are. Even! Place your bets. Why don't you stay a couple more days instead of just one night? Staying on as my guest will greatly raise your reputation. Thank you. You know, at the gambling house tonight, there was this beautiful woman who sat next to me ‒ Boss. He's back again. He says he wants to be accepted into the clan no matter what. That persistent kid. When I tried to send him away, he clung to a pillar. These days, I can't seem to keep out the young men begging to join my clan and work for me. To wear a narrow kimono, to twist the end of the topknot in a stylish way, to wear a sword and walk with a swagger. Young men must find it appealing. Boss. I beg you, it's my greatest wish. Let me join your clan. Make me a real man. Make you a real man, eh? Shut up! Keep out of this! Umeji, this man is called Zatoichi. He's a well-respected man in our world. I'm Umeji. Pleased to meet you. I have girls working for me, but I want to become a proper yakuza. Listen to him! Trying to get Ichi on your side won't get you anywhere. I'll predict whether or not you'll become a full-fledged yakuza. How many girls work for you? Four. Oh, I took in a new girl today. So that makes five. Ichi, what's your type? I'll let you bed a girl you like. Ah, we're here. Oh, he's blind. This is an important guest. Here we are! Now, let's drink! You're very muscular. Marvelous! That was great. Can I have some sake? I'd like some too. How nice. That's amazing. Thank you. That was a neat trick. It's my treat tonight. Drink as much as you like. Wonderful! Isn't there a larger cup? Here, use this one. Oh, that's great. With this large cup? Okay, that's good. You're fantastic. Amazing, I'm impressed. All right, let's have fun until we drop! Hear, hear, Mr. Masseur! Hey, there, masseur ‒ Ichi, speak to Boss Hokuro for me. All right. Then raise 100 ryo tonight and bring it to me. 100 ryo? That's impossible. Hey! If you want to be a yakuza, you've got to have the guts to steal even from your parents. All right? I'll be waiting for you in the guest room. Hey, there, masseur Where are you going? Ichi. Wake up, Ichi. What's the matter? I stole the money. Here's 100 ryo. You stole it? Give me the rope over there. This one? What are you doing? They chime pleasantly. A treat to my ears. What's going on? It's a charm to test if you'll become a real man or not. Go to bed now. Tell me, did you sleep well? You couldn't, right? That's good. If the sound of gold coins doesn't keep you up all night, then you're beyond saving. Take the money back to your father. Become a man who can walk with his head held high. The women at the bathhouse are young and pretty. The women at the bathhouse are young and pretty. The young woman who sat next to me at the gambling house ‒ Oh, the women will go into the bath with you. It's a very enjoyable bathhouse. The floor is slippery. Be careful. I will. Welcome. Thank you. - Even! - Odd! Could I place my bet with yours? Thank you. Ichi. I had a nice bath. Well, have a seat. Could I have a cup of tea? Bring his tea quickly! I heard you were attacked, so I was on my way with my men to bring you back safely. Drop your swords! Oh, no. I'm sorry. You shall be killed at my hands only. Zatoichi is simply a nuisance. He's like a tiny stone hidden in the rice. Boss Men has gathered fellows who are good with swords. It's better to use somebody who has no skill with the sword or in killing people. Those of us who are blind are starved for affection. Love will be a better weapon than the sword to kill a blind man. Why don't you put her to use? Sir? I will. Who is it? I won at a game the other day, thanks to you. Oh! It's you. My, I'm pleased that you remember me. I'd like to thank you in some way. Will you come with me? Yes. Welcome. Thank you. Please come again. - Please enjoy. - Thank you. Have some sake. That's great. Thank you. But ma'am, you are ‒ Call me Okiyo. Okiyo? That's a pretty name, Okiyo. You must be wondering why I'm traveling by myself. Well, yes. Why is that? If you must know, I don't like gambling, in truth. I hate yakuza. Oh, I see. I hate men. Well, even if you hate men, men won't leave you alone, I'm sure. But you know, Ichi. Yes? I guess it's not going to be easy to make you like me. But it is. But no matter how well I dress or make myself up, you can't see it. I can sense a beautiful woman right away. By her scent. Oh, this? Ah, it smells good. Your cup is empty, isn't it? Okiyo, you're a kind woman. Oh, no. I'm sorry. I spilled sake on your kimono. Forgive me. Wait! Sorry. Excuse me, could we have our bill? How much is it? - I'll bring the change. - Keep it. Thank you. Let me tie your sandal straps. - Please come again. - Thanks. Come with me. Please give me a moment. I remember you. Why do you want to kill me? For this. Chrysanthemum? She used to love chrysanthemums. You slept with my wife, didn't you? No, I never did. But even if I deny it, as I am a man after all, you won't believe me. But if ll were to admit to sleeping with your wife... It doesn't matter who does the job, as long as Zatoichi is killed. My task is to see it through. I killed all the other men. You are the last man. The last man? When I kill you, my wish will be accomplished! Go. Am I cleared of the crime? You give me my only purpose to live. If I kill you now ‒ You'll have nothing to live for. I will kill you someday. Thank you. Take care. Hello. Isn't it a nice day? Yes, indeed, it's a nice day. Why, it's you! What have you been doing? Where do you go every day? You don't work and wander about. - A man has a man's business to do. - What business? Why don't you work like a man? - Listen, darling. - Don't call me that! Show me your behind like you always do. - Stop it. - Come on. Sweet-talking me now? What an idiot. I can't believe you fell for it. Go to hell! Go to hell yourself! Stupid woman. - You kicked me! You started it. What are you doing? What am I doing? I'm kicking you out! That'll teach you. Don't you get sassy with me, woman! Now I'm really mad! - You gonna fight me? - Damn right! I won't stand being insulted! You think I don't know you're fooling around? What are you going on about? Get off me! You bastard! I'm gonna Kill you today, for sure! You're crazy! You can't get away from me! Stop running, coward! You dare look down on me, I'll kill you! Could I have a cup of tea? He's a customer. - Oh, my. - Pull yourself together. Wait on him. I'm awfully sorry. Hey! What do you think you're doing? Do you have to flirt with every woman you see? Don't be so jealous! - Why shouldn't I be? - Don't hit me. Oh, that felt good. You're a pervert. Serve them tea. This way, please. Bring their tea quickly! Thank you for waiting, here's your tea. Thanks. Hey, masseur. Do you know a Zatoichi? I'm Zatoichi. I've finally found you! I've been up and down every main road looking for you. I have an express message for you. Oh, I see. I've delivered it now, all right? Thank you. Okiyo, could you read it for me? All right. I'm afraid I can't read this letter, Ichi. I see, it's not surprising that you can't. Is it from a woman? So there's a woman in your life? No, the letter isn't from a woman. It's from a man who's regarded almost like a god among the people in my trade. One of these days, I hope to see this man ‒ Rather, I hope to hear his voice in person. There's going to be a grand gathering that's held once a year, so this is ‒ An invitation to the gathering? Yes. Are you going? Well... Thank you. I'm a blind bird without destination. I'll go and see if I get lucky. Thanks for the tea. Thank you very much. Take care. The air is nice and cool, isn't it? What's the matter? Oh, no. This isn't good. Let me ‒ It's best to lick on a wound. Give me your foot. Does this hurt? All right now. Can you walk? Ichi, let me borrow your cane. Ichi! - Okiyo! Okiyo! Are you all right? Okiyo! Ichi! Ichi! Ichi, hang in there! Thank you. Take this. Take this. For me? I'm so sorry. Are you all right? Good-bye. Don't go. Don't go to see the man who sent you the letter. Okiyo! Okiyo? - We have rooms available. - Our bath is ready. After I saw you last, my parents disowned me. I didn't become a real man. My girls deserted me. It's all your fault. I beg you. Make me your henchman. Make me a real man. Don't be so down just because a woman left you. Seven women deserted me. Ichi, I heard you're being pursued by all sorts of men. If you have me with you, you can relax when you go to sleep. I love you. Hold me. Hold you? That's right. And then what? I feel lonely. But I don't. What are you doing? Come on. If I kill you, I can become a real man! Boss Hokuro said he'd give me some turf and make me a real man if I killed you. Fool! You know what a real man is? A man who can walk with his head held high! Make yourself scarce quickly, or your head will come off your shoulders. You're reborn now. Become a real man in the true sense. All right? Understand? Then go. I'm a man, I can't leave like this. You can't? Then what will it take to make you leave? Let me hit you. Let me hit you! You'll really go home? For sure? I'm a man. I don't go back on my words once I utter them. All right, then. There's nobody around, is there? Nobody's around. No need to flinch. I haven't hit you yet. So long. Ichi! So long. So long. - Okiyo is back? - Yes. Is something wrong? Just the other day, when I visited him unannounced, he stepped down in his tabi socks to the dirt floor and washed my feet. Oh, who did this? Migi did. Boss Migi did? In his tabi socks? It seems Migi has learned how to be humble. I think he'll do all right making a living in our business. No, I still have a lot to learn. By the way, when tomorrow's grand gathering is over, I'm planning to retire. What do you think? Retire, sir? I will pass my entire turf over to my successor. You can't be serious. Your vast turf stretches over the eight provinces of Kanto. Nobody but you can preside over it. Is that right? Yes. That is the honest truth. You can do it. I can't possibly fill your shoes. I name you as my successor. I can trust you. Are you saying this in all truthfulness? I will make the announcement at tomorrow's grand gathering. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. I have longed to be blessed with this honor. I've worked very hard so that this day might come. Once I succeed the boss, I will oversee our interests with renewed devotion and follow the proper way of the yakuza. I entreat you for your continued support. Congratulations. The “proper way” of the yakuza, eh? Congratulations, sir. Congratulations, sir. Boss. Okiyo, is that you? Good to see you back. I've decided to make your father my successor. Thank you, sir. Did you take care of Zatoichi as you were told? I'm asking you what became of Zatoichi. Ichi has no intention of going against you. And he does no harm to others unless he's provoked. He was pleased when he received your invitation, so please ‒ Boss. Please spare Ichi's life. I beg you. I see. Ichi gave you this lily, en? Did my sister come back? Men, what brings you here? The Big Boss is throwing a party in your honor since you will be succeeding him. Let's go. Welcome, sir. Thank you for the invitation. You spotted him? No grand gathering before today or in the future could boast of being attended by so many bosses from all over the country. Indeed, it could only be realized by the power the Big Boss enjoys. I'm just a blind man. I am simply a blind man who holds no power. We still have some time before the games of the grand gathering begin. Please feel free to enjoy yourselves with food and sake until then. Thank you for your courteous address. We respectfully accept your kind offer. A one-on-one game between you and me? Is that the entertainment for tonight? I want you to wager your life. I must wager something in return. How about this? I accept the challenge. Is Okiyo your ‒ Odd. - Showdown! Will you make the call? Ichi. There is no way for you to win this challenge. My esteemed guests, the highlight of tonight's entertainment will start now. Do enjoy it thoroughly. Look! Look! Everybody, take a good look! Well? How did it go? How burned is he? Big Boss! Everybody, it would seem the real entertainment is about to begin now. What are you all waiting for? Finish him off! Ichi! Show yourself or innocent lives will be lost because of you! Ichi! Please show yourself! She's alive. Ichi! Ichi, I beg you! Help! Show yourself! Big Boss, I will kill Ichi! Let me borrow your sword! Father! We yakuza are outlaws who walk the back roads of society. But instead, you arrogantly ride in a palanquin in the middle of the main roads, and force people who make an honest living to kneel down to you. And you kill innocent people as if they were vermin. Do you call that making atonement for your ancestors' sins? A man like you shouldn't be allowed to live. On behalf of the sun god, I will punish you. Ichi, hear Okiyo die with a beautiful cry of agony. Stop! Good. Walk straight ahead towards me. That's right. Walk slowly toward me. I like to take my time with my pleasures. You're just a common, blind fool, after all! What happened? To me? Did something happen to me? It's quiet. Why is it so quiet? Zatoichi is mine to kill. Don't kill Ichi! Thanks to you, I escaped my death earlier. You're still determined to kill me? I hold my grudges to the end! You loved your wife very deeply to the end. To love. To hate. It wouldn't be good to love her. Ichi. I am now ‒ You hate me. Hate you? That would imply I was in love with you. Don't flatter yourself. Ichi, you're all that's left to me now. Take me with you. A sighted woman can't fool a blind man. Ichi. Hey, masseur! Have a ride on my horse! It's all right. I'm on my way back. I'll give you a discount. Have a ride. It's all right. It's all right. Shit. “It's all right,” he says. What's all right, huh?? It is all right. It's all right this way. THE END
