Had another dream about Dae Dae again. - You know, I know all about that. I lost my brother when I was 16 years old but, you know, when he comes to me and my dreams, I just use it as confirmation that he's still with me. - Yeah, I know that his spirit still lives. Crazy thing is I busted my ass to get him off the streets, just for him to die and me end up in the streets. How's that happen? - Well, God works in mysterious ways but, I mean, look around.

Omar doesn't give a fuck about you. I mean, why else do you think he had you come here, knowing that you might get caught. But he promised you something in return, hm? Money, freedom, drugs. Whatever it was, he wasn't gonna fulfill on his end. What you think he doin' right now, hm? Not giving a fuck. But you know what? I see you don't give a fuck either. Larue, cut this nigga head off. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm a tell you, I'm a tell you. - What was that? - I said I'm a tell you. - Nah, you goin' show me. - Okay, okay.

That's where I met him. - I mean now tell me shit. How do I know that ain't somebody else's room? - I said I'll show you where he is, not give you proof. - Motherfucker, well you better figure out something if you wanna live. - Look. Ain't that him? - I told you. - Shut up. - I might be damned. I can't believe I'm saying this but, I got a visual on your boy. What you want us to do? You want us to move in? Nah, not yet. I got a plan. You ready for the meeting? - Bet, say less. What you want us to do with our other boy over here? Get rid of him. - Say less. - All right, fellas, listen up. Intel is telling us that these folks are all connected. It's y'alls job to tell me how. I want to know how this gas station clerk goes from zero to hero. What happened to her brother? Where are they working? What's their next move? - You mean to tell me that that woman stole millions of dollars from top corporations in America and no one even noticed? - Right underneath their goddamned nose. Families have lost their businesses, homes, property. - She deserves everything coming for her. - You bet. - So we think this mystery man is the one who's helping her? - We can only assume. We may have a lead from this previous operation, but it's an old one. - Yeah, but people like that, they always keep moving. They never sit still. - Well, all moving things come to a stop eventually. - Says no physicist ever. - Are you fucking kidding me? - I mean an object in motion stays in motion. - Are you fucking kidding me? - I'm just saying. - Hey, we gotta get on this now. - Listen, listen, listen, gentlemen. - I'm just saying. - Listen.

So let me be the first to say your presence is appreciated. In the last six months, we have established a solid network allowing us to redirect payroll from some of America's top corporations. Recently, an offer has been made for us to distribute blow from Puerto Rico, using our U.S. resources. Among the other streams of income, these two are our biggest. Everyone here plays a vital role in the success of our future. Maria here is our international business affair officer. She is going to handle the routes and transportation of the cocaine. Black, Mac and Tone, you'll be her distributors for the Midwest. - Alex here is one of the most talented financial tycoons I've ever met. She is gonna take our money and flip it into the market, making us untouchable. And Miss Rebecca Winfield, she makes sure we don't get into trouble. You all should know Cali, my partner. If you can't get in touch with me, call him. He'll get with me. Finally, Bug, our tech guy. Without him, there's no us. Now my goal is to provide generational wealth. You stay loyal to me, your kids' kids shouldn't want for nothing. I'm going to be the biggest female hustler in the history of mankind. But, there's one threat. His name is Omar. - Princess. - Word is she built a new team. - But she's not even using the same algorhythm Jason created. - Her tech is so advanced. I can't even crack the mainframe. - Omar, what are we gonna do? - We move on to plan B. - What was plan A? - One that didn't end well. So now we switch it up, we get in her mind, make it, make it seem like I'm giving in, make it seem like I want to partner with her. - What are we at Diamond? - What? - Princess trusted you the most, right? - I mean, I guess. But shit, don't none of that matter now. She don't trust none of us. - But, if we make it seem like I turned on you too, she wouldn't know what to expect. Yeah, T that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna have you go over to her, act like you wanna join forces with her for revenge towards me. Then, we'll have an inside man. - I don't know, Omar. That doesn't seem like a good idea. - What's up with you, huh? Don't you want all us to win? - Of course I do. - You can't. You always talking about, "I don't know, Omar," or, "Maybe it don't seem right, Omar," or "It may not work, Omar." Why can't you just be like, "Let's go, Omar!" or "Let's do it, Omar. It's great idea, Omar." You know what? Just sit there. Don't say shit. Have a coconut smile and shut the fuck up. All right? If you don't got any bright ideas to bring to the table, I don't wanna hear nothing. What? What y'all scared of Princess now? Y'all gonna act like some bitches? That bitch shot at me. I ain't going out like that. This is the time that we unite. Diamond, I need you in this. - Okay, Omar. I got you. - What do you want me to do? - You and Ace, y'all go to Daeton. Check out that new formula. Jason's goin' to test it while you're all down there, okay? Jason, we need to get as much cash as possible, if you're going to ride with me, okay? - Okay. - The mission here is to end whatever Princess thing she got going on by any means. - By any means, we cannot let Omar get the upper hand. Fam and Doe, I need y'all to go back to the motel and track his every move. - Anything for you, Princess. - Maria, your flight leaves in a few hours. Is there anything else you need from me? - Not that I can think of. Oh, do you have that phone? - Oh yeah. - Untraceable, right? - Yes. - Okay. I'll call you when I land. - Rebecca, I'm going to send Bug with you to give you a little bit more insight on what we're doing digitally so that you have a better understanding. Okay? - Okay. Come on, Bug. - Call me when you get the email, okay? - Okay. - All right, look. Omar is a tricky motherfucker. I don't need y'all getting caught up in his war. It's already bad enough we lost Dae Dae. - It's because of Dae Dae we wanna ride for you, Princess. - I know that. That's why I need y'all to distribute this income and product. I need brains now more than ever. Y'all know how the streets move when it come to rock. - You're not going to have to worry about that. Yeah, we got that shit locked. - Even the white boys in upper Arlington? - Shit, they ain't fucking with us. - Plus we took the clientele last year. - It's a new year, Black. Every day is a new year when it comes to this life. The next hour isn't promised for any of us. That's why I need you to set up the meeting with the Arlington boys. Bring them into what we got going on. - With all due respect Sis, this shit ain't going to never work. They ain't nothin' but stuck up, rich-ass white folks. - Shit. Good thing I'm rich too. All I see is green. Set up the meeting, Black. Let's do this in the name of Dae Dae. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay, let's go. - You set up that meeting now but, we still want you there just in case. All right. Let me know the time and place. - I will soon. - That didn't go bad at all. - Do you think everybody was receptive? - To me? Yeah, we gotta wait and see. - Larue, you handle that problem from earlier? - Yeah, his body down in my cellar. All right. They just landed. - All right, boys. Let's go meet the new buyer. - Welcome, welcome. You must be Princess. I'm Nicko. Cali's told me a lot about you. - Hello, Nicko. - Come with me, please. Princess, meet my colleagues, Amish and Amara. They flew all the way in from India to learn this information. - We have heard great things about you. - Which I hope to be true. - Well, I can show you better than I can tell you. - Nicko tells us that you have managed to scale your income by 75% in the last six months. - And I hope to do the same for your business. Did you bring the money? - Slow down, Princess. You'll get your money. Show us this algorithm. - You see, it's not that simple. I have to- - Fraud! I told you, Amish, we should have never come here. You wanted to listen to Nicko. - Hey! I said it wasn't simple, not impossible. Larue, hand me the tablet. This is how it works. First, you're gonna go here and then do this. - Princess, princess, I must say I'm impressed. Nicko, hand me over the briefcase. - Now remember, this information is only valid for 90 days. - And then what? We come back to you for more? - Well, of course. And if we establish a solid network, the initiatives are much greater. Thank you. - Pleasure doing business with you. - Until next time.
