[♪♪♪] [PHONE DIALING] MAN [ON PHONE]: Hello? Hi, Greenie. This is Big Mike. Look, I want you to bet 10 grand on Gorilla Watson for me on the big fight with Chopper Kane. Yeah, but I can't get any odds on Chopper Kane so spread 10 G's on Gorilla Watson for me like I told you and relax. I own Chopper Kane and he'll lose. That's for positive. I'm expecting the Chopper's handlers here any second now. Yeah. Okay, so long. [KNOCKS "SHAVE AND A HAIRCUT" ON DOOR] Come in. Hiya, boss. Nice to see you. Say, that smells good. You got an extra cigar? Sure, fellas. Have a cigar. Gee, thanks. [ALL GROAN] They're too rich for your blood. Sit down! How you coming with the Chopper's training? Swell, chief. He'll murder Gorilla Watson in two rounds. Yeah, he'll flabunger him. Ooh! Let him alone. Ooh! MOE: Watch what you're doing. Fine. Fine, fellas. Keep the Chopper real sharp. I'm betting plenty. Say, come on, have a cigar, boys. My fingers are sore from the last one. Come on. Have one. I was only kidding. Okay. Thanks. Smoke up. Oh, boy. LARRY: You're swell, boss. [LAUGHING] [STOOGES LAUGHING] Wise guys! [ALL GASP] MOE: Go! Ooh! Oh, caught my sneaker, eh? [GRUNTS] Missed me. MOE: Why, you... [ALL GRUNTING] Wait a minute. I'll take a short count. The winner, and still world's champion, Oscar the Dummy. Ha-ha-ha! I'm beginning to enjoy this workout. I even feel like a few rounds of boxing. That's swell. But we ain't got no sparring partner. No, no. Not me, fellas. Besides, I bruise easy. Oh, don't be a baby. It's all in fun. I hate fun! What, are you surrounding me, fellas? No, you gotta do it. Think of the dough. I'd rather think of my health. Here. Put this on your head. Thanks. We don't want the Chopper to hurt his hands. Oh... MOE & LARRY: Wait. Don't be a coward. You'll spar a little and exchange some love taps. Taps? Yeah, taps. Oof! Quiet! Come on. Wait a minute. Where did everybody go? Uh, this way. MOE: Get in there. Come on, come on. All right. Don't shove me. [SHEMP GROANS] Moe, Larry! Help! Oh! Wait a minute. Give me your foot. [BOTH GRUNTING] Come on. Help, you moron! [GRUNTS] You dumb ox, you. Oh, now I know how a gopher feels. Get these gloves on. Hey, there's Kitty. Hiya, baby. You're just in time to see the Chopper do his stuff. Kitty, I want you to meet Chopper Kane, the next heavyweight champion. Oh, I'm meeting a champion right now. Why, you say the sweetest things. Sugar, you're just about to see Chopper go into action. Oh, I just love to see a good fight. Well, you just stick around here. I'll murder that guy for you. Get the victim ready for the slaughter. Wait a minute, Chopper. Remember, love taps. Get him ready! This won't take long. Get a load of that Chopper. Lace that glove. Yeah, our Chopper's a bit of a wolf. Yeah. If he moves around the ring like he moved in on Kitty, I figure we got a new champion on our hands. MOE: Is it fixed? He's fixed, all right. Right over there, baby. What's the matter, kid? You nervous? Just my left hand. Ah, take it easy. With a dame around, the Chop will box like a perfect gentleman. Now when I ring the bell, you come out fighting. Any blood, ignore it. Where you going, fellas? [BELL RINGS] Look at that Chopper go. Wow! Yeah. Bet this roll on the Chopper to win by a knockout and hurry up before they cut the odds down. [CHUCKLES] [GONG RINGS] [GASPS] Larry, wait a minute! Oh, he's gone! SHEMP: I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. My hand slipped. Love taps. Love taps. Attaboy, Chopper! That's my baby! Five-to-one on a KO! Oh, boy! We're gonna be rich! Rich! [BOTH LAUGH] We're gonna be rich! Hey, don't get so familiar. Watch this one. Watch this, watch this. What's going on here? There goes Shemp with a left jab. There goes Shemp with a right cross. There goes Shemp with a haymaker! There goes Shemp. Ha-ha. [WATER GURGLING] What's the matter with you? Easy, boy. All right. Get him up. Up you go. Up. What's the matter with you? Up. What's the matter? Wait, I'll get it off. Take it easy. I know how to do it. Get your hands off. Come here. I got a system. Let me have it. Now, wait a minute. Easy, easy. Attaboy. Attaboy. [ALL GRUNT] Oh... Take it easy, kid. Take it easy. Easy, kid. Let me at him. Let me at him. Hey, boys, come here. LARRY: Hi. Hiya, boss. We just made a terrific bet on the Chopper to win the fight. We bet every cent we got. And every dollar too. That's too bad, because Chopper has to lose to the Gorilla. BOTH: Yeah, Chopper has to lose. No! Do as you're told or you'll wind up in cement kimonos. Oh, wait a minute. Boss, listen. Our whole bankroll-- Ow, ow! Ooh! Boss, please take it easy! I think I broke my eye-pokin' fingers. Good. Now you can't poke us in the eye. Ow! I had to open my big mouth. Now listen. We gotta decondition the Chopper. Soften him up so he'll lose. Yeah, it's better we lose our dough than our lives. [BOTH GRUNT] You imbecile, I'll-- Wait a minute. I said we gotta decondition the Chopper. So come on! Oh, oh! Chopper's getting right in the condition we want him. Here, have some cream puffs. They'll build you up. It's my favorite fruit. Ha-ha. Take some more. We got a lot of them. But baby doll, if you eat too much of that stuff you won't be in shape to knock out Gorilla Watson. Oh, honey, the way I feel now, I don't wanna hurt nobody. Honey, baby, after lunch will you read me another poem about love? My idea's working out swell. Look at him. He's so goofy you could knock him down with a handful of peanuts without the shells. Yeah, the way he's packing it in, the Gorilla will knock him stiff in the first round. He's sure making a pig of himself. Look who's talking. Give me that cake! If I only had some coffee. It's getting late. I wonder what's keeping the Chopper. What does your watch say? "Tick, tick, tick..." Ooh! Come on. Listen, he ought to be here by now. We gotta get him ready for the fight. Don't worry about getting Chopper ready for the fight. Worry about carrying him out afterwards. Let me at him! Where's that Gorilla Watson? I'll tear him apart! What happened? What happened? Me and Kitty had had a big beef, that's what happened. She threw me over for that big Gorilla. I'll murder him! Now, now, now, don't be hasty. Here, have a cream puff. I don't want a cream puff. Ooh, I'm mad! Oh, wait'll I get him in the ring. I'm gonna smash him. I'll smash him like-- Like this! How do you like that guy? Busted a perfectly good cream puff. You lamebrain. We're gonna be rubbed out after the fight and you're worried about a cream puff. Why, you-- Gorilla, don't lose your temper! You got fighting to do! Why you little punk! Ooh, my hand! Oh! Oh, my gosh, it's busted! Come in, quick. We gotta call this fight off. It's a show up for him! [ALL CHUCKLE] That did it. That did it. What a lucky break. With the fight called off, we don't lose our dough. Hot diggity dog. [CHUCKLES] Would I like to get a look at Big Mike's face when he finds out about this. Oh, you would, would you? I certainly would. Why don't you mind your own business? How do you like a guy bustin' in-- [COUGHING] You figured a nice way out for yourself by making the Gorilla break his hand. But you knocked me out of a chance to make 10 grand. Now listen, chief-- We can explain. Shut up! [ALL GROAN] All right, boys. Come and take them for a nice long ride. One way. STOOGES: Oh, no you don't! [ALL GRUNT] LARRY: Come on! MIKE: Get them! Shh. You fellas go in the door over there. I'll stay here. Go on. I think the coast is clear. [SCREAMS] Don't lock that! Don't lock that! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! I can't move. Oh, the gentleman can't move. Perfect. [SCREAMS] [LAUGHING] [GROANING] After you. Let me out of here! Aah! Nice going, Moe. I'll kill you! [SCREAMS] Smoke that for a while. Good work, pal. [GROWLING] Let us away. [STOOGES GASP] Won't somebody let me out of here? [STOOGES GASPING] [ALL YELL] [ALL YELL] [CLANGING CRASH] Yahh! [GROWLING] Whoa. [GASPS] [FOOTSTEPS RACING NEARBY] [SCREAMS] Uh... Tired, eh? So am I. Hey, Moose, seen anything on those guys? Well, we'll get 'em. Wonder which way they went. You go that way, and I'll go this way. What's the matter with you? MOE: That that! I'll show you. And that! Oh, oh! Take it easy now, will you? [MAN GRUNTS] Oh. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Honest, I-- Uh... [GASPS] Ouch! [LARRY LAUGHS] Hey, Moe, I just got one of them. He was standing right here where you are. Was he a short, fat fella? Yeah! Dark hair? Yeah! Did you hit him with that? Yeah! That was me! [GROANS] [BOTH GASP] [ALL GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [LAUGHING] I just flattened one of 'em. Aah! What are you doing there? Come on, get out, get out of there. Come on. Moe, Larry, let me in! Let me in! I get lonesome out here. Oh, so they're in there, huh? No. No, no. I was just talkin' to myself. Get something to batter the door down. Wait a minute. No. No, I got a soft skull. Let me go, will you? Look out there! Let me go! You're crushin' my eyeballs! [ALL GRUNTING AND SHOUTING] [GRUNTS] MOE: Take it easy, take it easy. That fixed you. Guess we got 'em, pal. Oh, boy. Oh, boy! [SHEMP LAUGHING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hey, Moe, bring a bucket of water, quick! [ALL GROANING] Hey, you revived them by mistake! Get 'em out of here! We'll get killed! Hurry, let's go. Let's go before they come to. Come on. Hey, he's losing weight. Nyaah! Come on, kid. We gotta get out of here. Come on. [♪♪♪]
