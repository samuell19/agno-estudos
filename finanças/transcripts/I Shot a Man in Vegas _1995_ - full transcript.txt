(wind rushing) - [Narrator] All right, listen up, you wanna hear the truth? (dramatic music) (dramatic music intensifies) (cars honking) (brakes squealing) - Viva Las Vegas! (sighs) (traffic rushing) (cars honking) (glass shattering) (coins clinking) (upbeat music) - Hey, man. Hello. Hello. How you doing? - Hi. - [Narrator] So here it is, five friends, one murder. Don't get me wrong, I'm not telling you this because of some enormous fucking need to confess about anything. You just gotta understand. Murder is not black and white, okay? Someone is killed. Someone is dead. And the rest is as gray as zebra's ass in the rain. You see, the thing is, people try to explain formed facts about why these things happen. The problem is everybody's got their own facts. The only fact I know is that if you lose your head, you forget who you're with. You forget who you're with, and you forget who your friends are. And if you've got no friends in this type of situation, you're better off being the unfortunate motherfucker taking the dirt nap than the one walking away. Facts. Something supported by evidence. It ain't all chocolate milk at lunch. - [Radio Presenter] It's KTSU, how do you do? You got the all-nighter here. Spinning your favorite light beer drinking, two step street, under rated classics for all lost wages to hear. As you know, every hour, by the hour, on the hour, we got the phone request line open, so let's see who's out there. How do you do? - [Lorna] Hi, all-nighter? - [Radio Presenter] Yeah, hi honey. - [Lorna] Good to be talking with you. - Yeah, that's your name? - [Lorna] Lorna. - Miss Lorna on the phone here with us here tonight. Lorna, are you lovin', lyin', leavin', or cheatin' sweetheart? - [Lorna] Oh, all-nighter, it's like this. See, my boyfriend, he doesn't know this, but I been seein' his best friend on the side. - [Radio Presenter] Well, that's cheatin', is it? - Oh no, I guess it is, but the reason why I'm callin' is because I know he's out there with someone- - [Person 2] Who's the king? - [Person 3] Elvis. Elvis is a king. - [Person 4] Hey, Elvis was pretty cool. - What's up? You two acting like a bunch of- - Get outta her. - What are you doing, Johnny? Jesus. (people shouting) (glass smashing) - Oh my God. - Stupid fuck! What are you doin', Johnny?

Everyone feel free to jump in if I make a mistake. We had just left the bar. We being me, Amy, Grant and Gale. And oh yeah, Johnny, you all remember Johnny? - Viva Las Vegas! - Okay? So we're walking back to the car. Then for some fuckin' reason, Grant and Johnny begin to fight. I run over to try and stop it. - What the fuck are you doin'? - But too late they take off running down some alley. And there we find Grant with a gun in his hand. A gun, a fuckin' gun. Where the hell did you get a goddamn gun? - Enough, Martin. - Enough? I don't think so. He just killed Johnny. What the hell were you thinking? - He wasn't thinking about anything. Something really terrible's happened and it's not his fault, it's something just happened. Now, just stop making me crazy and let me think about this. Just shut up. - Great, Nancy Drew here is gonna come up with a plan. Don't you think it's a little late to come up with a fuckin' plan? - No, I don't Martin. If we just keep driving around like this, we're just gonna get in a bigger mess than we can handle. - I can't handle it already! (elbow thuds) Goddammit! Goddammit! - Stop hittin' the car, Martin. Stop hittin' the car. - The car? - That's right. - The car! (polka music) I gotta turn this shit off. - Keep it on, it's helps me think. - Well, it's annoying me. - Then get the fuck out. - [Martin] Fine! - Martin, give me the knob. Come on, give me the fucking knob! Give it to me! - Hey! - Don't be a dick, give it to me. - Get outta here! - Give her the fucking knob right now. - Here, take the knob. - Ow! Fucking asshole. (playful music) Are you okay? - We all just have to calm down. We have to just, we have to come up with something. - Got an idea. - Great. - Shut up. - Gotta call my brother, he lives in California, he's been in this kind of trouble before, he's gonna know what to do. - Advice from Dillinger. - Just shut up, Martin. He can help us. - Are you sure? - Seems pretty evident to me that the first thing he's gonna say is not to be driving around with a dead body in the trunk and the guy who did it. - You don't think he'll, you don't think he'll call the police? - No, he's my brother, he's not gonna do that, he's gonna, he's gonna know what to do. He's not gonna do that until we can just, all sit down and just talk about this. - Alright, I'll just, I'll just pull it up there. (polka music) (dramatic music) (metal clanking) - I'll just make the call. I'm gonna talk to Frank and everybody's gonna be all right. (car door shuts) (footsteps tapping) (truck whooshing) (car door slams) Hi, someone's been shot accidentally. No, it's, it's not a homicide, it was an accidental thing. Um, yes, we have the body with us in the trunk. - I can't fuckin' believe it. I can't believe he killed Johnny. Shot him like it was nothing. They were friends. He's lost it, honey. Look, he's walking around with the gun in plain sight. If anybody sees that, we can all be in trouble. He might even start shooting again. Don't worry, I won't let him get you, I'll protect you. Don't worry, we just gotta keep calm, we gotta keep calm. - Yes, he's on parole, but he hasn't violated it. He hasn't violated parole. - Okay, this is what we're gonna do, this is what we're gonna do. I got an idea, when he's not looking, we're gonna make a break for it. We're gonna make a break for it, we can get to the desert and hide there. Once he's, once they've gone, we'll come back. We'll come back and we'll call the cops with Grant's car, there's no way they'll have any problem picking him up. - It's a 1956 gray Oldsmobile with a dent in the fender. - I saw that. What if I told you that was my car? - Okay, okay, I'll keep an eye open as soon as I say now, just open the door and slide out, I'll be right behind you. - No, it's not mine. - You're not helping me. I called you to help me and you're not helping me. If I leave with you, they're gonna arrest him and it was an accident. - I go to UNLV and well, we were heading up to Cali for the Dead shows up in Santa Clarita, right? And well, the van broke down and they all decided to hitch 'cause they didn't wanna miss the first show on Friday, right? Well, I said I ain't into that because I don't like hitchhiking and well, I'm waiting here for some of my friends to pick me up and take me back to campus. And then you guys pulled up and well, you're heading to California, right? - Yeah. I thought you didn't dig hitchhiking. - Well, I don't, but you guys look like nice people and- - You never know, could have dead body in the trunk. - I doubt it. - Now, go, go now, now go, go, go! Come on, let's get outta here, go- Amy Amy honey? - Alright, look, I, I've got 10 sheets of this blow in my bag, I was gonna sell it at the shows for food and shit but- - I'm just saying you don't wanna ride with us. - Okay. (gun bangs) (dramatic music) (brakes squeaking) (polka music) - That was stupid, you showed the girl the gun. I'm surprised you didn't pop the trunk too. - Relax Martin, just a teenage Dead-head hitchhiking alone. I think she has a little more to worry about from the cops than we do. - We have nothing to worry about from the cops. It's him that should be worried. - So what'd your brother say? - Um, I couldn't find him at his house right away. And he wasn't at his girlfriend's either, but I found him at Rick's place, you remember Rick, don't ya? That really tall Black guy with the- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Fucked-up teeth. - Yeah the one who wanted to bite me. - Right. - Excuse me, who the fuck cares what Rick looks like? - But what'd you tell him? - I told him that we got into a little trouble. - You tell him about Johnny. - No, I didn't wanna scare him. I just told him maybe we needed some money. - And is he cool with that? - Yeah, he was really cool. He was really cool. I just, we just have to get to his house and meet him and talk about this. I think we can make it in, by the morning. - I'm being kidnapped by Bonnie and Clyde. - He lives near Glendale, remember when we went there? - Check it on map. - [Gale] It's by the river. (somber violin music) - Martin, Martin, Martin. - Amy, honey you okay? - God, I was so worried about you back there, baby. I thought I'd lost you. - Martin, is everything okay? - Everything's gonna be just fine, Grant's gonna pull over soon and let us out and everything's gonna be just fine. - He still has the gun. What's he gonna do with it, now? - I think you should stop the car. - What? What for? - Murder for one thing. Where are we going? You've gotta stop, Grant. You've gotta turn yourself in. - I'm not turning myself in, it's, it's not gonna happen, so just get it outta your head. - At least give me the gun. - Give you the gun? No. I'm not giving you the gun. - Give me the fucking gun. - Martin! Stop it! (yelling) (screeching tires) (yelling) (screeching tires) (dramatic music) - Do you want me to fucking kill you? Is that what you want? Do you want me to fucking blow you up? Because, I will! - (screams) - Just shut the fuck up. - [Gale] You don't want to do this, please. (Amy panting) (Amy screaming) Please, just put the gun down, Grant. Grant, Grant, it's fine. (Amy panting) (car door slams) (gravel crunching) - Grant! Grant, no! (Martin panting) Come on, please. Just tell me what happened. - What happened? I'm not even sure myself. - Why? I keep asking you that? Why'd you do it? It was just an argument over stamps or Elvis or something. I mean, you killed him over a stupid little argument? How could you? I just don't understand. What happened tonight? As soon as I can remember, we were having fun in the bar and just fun and drinks. Johnny was late as usual. I swear that boy will miss his own funeral. - [Gale] That's Johnny for ya. - Tell Amy I'm looking for if you see her, all right. - You got it, Martin. - All right, thanks. Charlie. - Hey, Martin, how you doing man? - You seen Amy around? - No, I haven't seen her man. - I owe you five bucks. Hey. - Okay, thanks man, later. Anyway- (rock music plays) - Hey, thanks man. (footsteps tapping) Hey, Nick. - Hey Martin, how you doing? - All right, you seen Amy around? - Yeah, I think she was outside about a half hour ago. - A half hour? I thought she was going to the can? - I dunno maybe she got issues, man. - What? Oh, Amy, where you been, honey? I've been looking all over for you. - You believe this fucking guy? Too busy with the women to welcome his own friend to the bar. - Me? - You. Me? - Yeah, you. - Who's the asshole? - Asshole? Ah, asshole, you talking to her? - No, I'm talking to you, my friend, take a look over here. Hey, Fred. - Yeah. Pal. - Waitin' for your ass a while now. - You've been drinking? - Yeah, I've been drinking a beer or two. - How bout another beer? How bout another beer? - Alright. Amy, where you been, honey? I've been looking all over for you. I just went to put my purse in the car, I didn't wanna forget it. - Nick says he hasn't seen you in a half an hour. - Aww. (lips smacking) Nick just pinched my five minutes ago when I left for the car. - Nick. - You're at the bar, girl. - Hey. - It makes me feel bad and unattractive. - How are you doing? - Hi Johnny. - How are you doing? - I'm talking to someone else. Can I talk to Amy? - Yeah, I'll slide over. - No, I want to talk to her in private. - Fine, fine. - Slide me my drink, John, on your way in. - What are you drinking? - Don't ask me for the 7&7 you never like it. Can you hand me my lighter? It's in my coat. - That's not it. - That's not it so I don't know what to tell you. - What, what you looking for? - My seven? It's in the inside pocket. - [Johnny] I'm sorry. Everything's cool. I gotta take a piss Martin. No, no, no. - I gotta take a piss. Can you smarten and move please? - Get up. Get up. He's gotta take a piss. - You're not gonna like it. - Johnny. Johnny, can you - - I got too many things - Fine, all right. Where are you going? (indistinct chatter) - I'll have a seven and seven. It's fine. - I want another one. - Go ahead - No, go ahead. - Go ahead. After you. - Where's Grant? - It's insane. I'm in there 10 goddamn hours a day. I'm about ready to quit every day it's Martin, I'm stuck in the sales update. Could you help me back out? Driving me crazy. - I don't know how you can work a steady paycheck, man. - I do. Martin's a fucking upstanding member of our city. Just cause he grew up in Vegas doesn't mean you gotta be a piece of shit. Am I right? - Balls, that's right. - Yeah, here's to us being losers. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't forget about us motherfucker. - You don't get us drunk, you may not get some tonight. - Why? Why you gonna swear all the fucking time Gale? - Why do I have to swear all the fucking time? - I'm just saying why you gotta swear so much? - Are you kidding? You don't say anything when anyone else - we swear all the time. - Who? - Everybody. - I'm talking to you. I'm not talking about everybody. - How you doing? - [Gale] Are you kidding? - You okay. - Locked and loaded. - [Amy] Your drunk man. - Locked and fucking loaded. Here we go. (bottles clink) Get me another drink, will you? - Wait, I just bought you a drink. - What? - Why don't you buy me a drink? - Get me another drink. What? I just asked you for a drink. Oh really, what? Come on. Come on. Come one. - You want a drink? Hey, Barry. (punches landing) That's what I love about this place. Nobody gets hurt. (glass shattering) - [Grant] I was making a toast. - [Johnny] I got an idea. - [Grant] Got an idea? - [Johnny] Get you fast money. - This is Johnny talking to me about making money, about earning money fast. - Is there any other way? - That's pretty funny coming from Mr. Vegas over here. What? Only guy I knows lives here his whole life and never made a red cent gambling. - That's not true. - That's not true? - I just don't gamble much. - [Amy] You gamble all the time. - [Martin] That's what I'm talking about. - [Gale] You don't have any money. (banging) - Who's the pretty girl? - At least, when I do gamble, I don't go to jail. - That ain't fair my friend. I was only in for how long, honey? - 10 days. - 10 days, it was nothing, big fucking deal. - Nothing? - Nothing. - You spent half your life doing 10 days inside. Why? I don't know. But it adds up, my friend. - Johnny, What the fuck you doing? - Repeat offender I think it's called. - Johnny, come on man. (trash rattling on the ground) - [Martin] Come on man. (scuffle ensuing) (gunshot) (dramatic music) (Amy crying and yelling) - Bull-fucking shit Martin. If that's what you saw, then you were in the wrong fucking alley. - How can you say that? How can you in any rational mind fucking say that? He's nuts. He's a goddamn Manson case. Ted Bundy Jr. You're a fucking psycho. - Just, just open the door, alright? Just open. Just open the - - What so you can kill me too? - I'm not gonna kill you. Look, I'm putting the gun away. Alright? I just want to talk to you face to face. - Excuse me for saying so, but fuck you. Ain't no way I'm going out there. You think I'm nuts? - No. You think I'm nuts? Remember? - And you're not? - Just open the fucking door. Open the door. Martin. Geez, what the fuck are you doing? What the is wrong with you? You gotta understand, Johnny was, Johnny was a sick fuck. He was out there. He could have hurt someone tonight. - So I guess could've was enough for you to find him guilty. - No, shit. You don't understand. You didn't know him like I did. He was, he was a desperate motherfucker. I've seen him do things that scared me. - So now you're Perry fucking Mason. - What you just said about tonight, all of it was bullshit, man. None of it happened that way. None of it. You understand? It's just, it's just wishful thinking on your part. Just wishful fucking thinking. - What I think is wishful fucking thinking, is your pathetic ass standing out there trying to convince me that Johnny asked he got? - Just open the fucking door. Amy opened the door. Just get out. Get fuck outta my car. Just get the fuck outta my car. You wanna see what can happen. You see that? That's the fucking reality here. That dead piece of shit. - Shit - You see that? Look at this. Look at that. You are just as covered in this shit as me. That body didn't get in there by itself. We are one in this. Do you understand? - Get off me! - That dead piece of shit doesn't know it's dead. All it knows, it doesn't have to deal with stupid motherfuckers like you anymore. - What you're doing is wrong? - [Grant] Well, I'm no fucking role model. - [Martin] Johnny was your friend. - Martin doesn't know what he's talking about. - [Grant] That's the reality. - He doesn't know shit. He's wrong. - [Grant] Open your fucking eyes for once. - My eyes were open all the days that Johnny was alive with us. Grant, how about yours? - It's not right, Martin. How you remember? That's just, that's not right. - Bullshit, that's just what happened. - No, it's not bullshit. What's with you? This whole fucking night is so terrible. I know, I know that. If I could take it back, I would. And Grant, man - Johnny was fucking crazy. I know that. But he shouldn't be dead. You, he shouldn't have shot him. We're all trying to understand this, and we can't. I don't get it. And you're not helping me, Grant. I love you and you're not helping me understand you or understand what happened. Now come on. We got to the bar at 9:30. We sat in our booth at the back. We ordered drinks just like always. We talked. - Hey, I was waiting for you. - What's your problem. - Thanks babe. Keep the change. Hey guys. - What? - Let's have a toast, huh? Huh? - Absolutely. - So where's Amy. - She's in the can. Fuck her. She'll toast on the next one. To getting drunk! - Getting laid - Getting to sleep early tonight. - Oh - Oh, man. You're supposed to do that with whiskey not tequila. - Who said? - It's just the way it's done. - Well, this is the way I do it, Martin. I'm sorry, alright. - Well, you do it wrong Grant. - I do it wrong? How can I be doing it wrong? If this is the way I do it? This is the way I like it. How is it wrong? Alright. - Hey, whatever you say, man. - I'm just saying. - Whatever you say. - Just don't tell me how to drink my fucking liquor, alright. - Aw, you're cute. - Oh, great. Great. Rub it in. Rub it in. - What? - My girl disappears into the black hole probably forever and you two could care less. - Yeah, he's right. He's right. We should be more worried. She's probably in the parking lot right now blowing a college guy. - Yeah. No, no, honey. - Thanks Gale. - [Gale] Just don't drink too much tonight. I don't feel like breaking any records. (laughing) - [Grant] Don't talk like that in front of everybody. - It's not everybody. It's just Martin. - Yeah, just tell Martin. Why don't you tell us every detail in your sex life? No. Really. Really? Gale. - Yes. - What position does he like? - [Grant] All right - [Gale] From behind - Oh! What are you doing? - Shh. You mean from behind! - Why are you embarrassed? I'm the one who has to be like, like a dog. - Stop it. Enough. - Weren't you gonna say Rin Tin Tin? - Okay. Why don't you go look for your little lady. (Martin barking) - Get outta here. Go look for your lady, all right. Just get outta here. Come on. - Alright, I know when I'm not wanted. - [Grant] You're not wanted. - I know when I'm not wanted. (Gale laughing) - Charlie. - [Charlie] Hey Martin. How you doing? - Seen Amy around? - No I haven't seen her man. - I owe you five bucks, right man? - Oh thanks man.

I'm really proud of you. - Just don't tell the guys alright. 'Cause Johnny, you know, I just don't want him to know. - Oh Jesus. - Just don't tell him alright. - Johnny wouldn't know what to do with a paycheck if it fucked him up the ass. And Martin, Christ, don't get me started. - You really proud of me? - I'm really, really proud of you. I'm really, I'm, I swear to God. I'm really proud of you. That's great. - Okay (laughing) - Oh, I'm laughing cause I'm happy. - Which one is yours? - Just don't understand why you gotta swear all the time. - What? Everybody we know swears? Why are you (indistinct) - What do you mean? I'm just saying. You said that before. - You swear all the time. All the time. - [Grant] I swear all the time. - All the time. - [Grant] So what?

Elvis was God. - Where'd you grow up Fucking Memphis? - Viva la here - I'm just saying, if you want to talk about anything, if you want to talk about shaping music, then you gotta know something about music. And if you knew something about music, then you's be talking about Johnny Cash. - Man, Johnny Cash is still playing the strip. - He's the coolest. He did real time, man. - Is that all you care about? - Did Elvis ever do any time? - No. You didn't, man. - There you go. I'm just saying.

You don't know what the I'm talking about. You know damn well what I'm talking about. What are you laughing at?

Gimme another drink. - I just bought you a drink. - I don't wanna pay for my drink. - Why don't you buy me a drink? - I don't have any fucking money. - (indistinct) I always buy you a fucking drink. Why don't you go buy your fucking drink? Marie! Fuck you man. (punches landing) (Commotion) - You - Come back here. Come back - It's over man.

Come on. Please. Breathe you asshole. - Just stop it, Martin. Stop it. Don't you fucking ever call him an asshole again? Look at you. You don't give a shit if Johnny is alive or dead. All you care about is what's gonna happen to you. Why Martin? Why do you always care about yourself? What about me? What about Gale? What the fuck about Grant, Martin? God, Johnny is dead. That's not Johnny. The real Johnny was the coolest boy I ever met. But you wouldn't know that, now would you? He fucking hated you, Martin. Couldn't fucking stand you. He told me all the time. I was fucking him, Martin. I fucked him the first day I met him. You didn't have a clue, did you? - Baby honey? Don't say those things, baby. They hurt. - They hurt! God Martin, how the fuck do you think I feel? Please, if you just stop thinking about yourself, you'd see how you're making all us hurt. Martin, Johnny only cared about Johnny. I want him back too. He's not coming back. Please, just help Grant, please. (slap) - You're crazier than a shit house rat. - Hey. - You were not fucking Johnny. Do you hear me? You were not fucking Johnny. You're crazy. You lost it somewhere between Vegas and fucking no man's land here. You checked out. How can you ask me to be on Grant's side? How can you say that murder is right? Murder's wrong! (sad music) (car zooming by) (sad music continues) (music intensifies) (music slows) (music fades) - We should make it to LA by dawn at this rate. - You know what, sweetie? Check that map Grant got us. I wanna get off the interstate. Gotta find something at a deli. How's it going back there? - Where are we now? - I have to go to the bathroom. - There's a cup on the floor. Grant sweetie. Are you okay? - [Amy] I got it now. - I think he's dead. You wanna pull over so I can toss him in the trunk too? - Fuck off, Martin. Sweetie, you want me to pull over or something? You okay? - Oh, Gale, I don't think he's looking too good. Grant, Grant. Snap out of it. Come on. Come on. I know what you're thinking back there. Believe me. I know how you feel. Just talk to me. Okay? Please, just talk to me. - I didn't want, I didn't want to do it. I never, never would've hurt him. (sighs) You just have to understand that I never wanted to hurt him. - We know, we know - We know, we're just trying to help you. You're a good person. - Am I? I killed someone, someone I knew. How can I be a good person if I did that? It's just out of control. It's just completely out of control. If I, if I didn't, if I hadn't done it, someone else would've. - We understand. We know. - So fast. It was self-defense. - Self-defense against what? A rotten piece of the wood? - [Amy] Martin. - Shut up Martin. Jesus. - Something I've been meaning to ask you all night. What makes you so fucking different than the rest of the world? Huh? You're no better than me. You don't deserve any special treatment. What you did is no different than the guy who kills for money or, or drugs. What makes you above all that? Huh? You look in that fucking mirror and tell me, I can't believe what you two are saying. He murdered Johnny! And now he's taking us all down with him. - Martin, leave him alone. - Shut up, baby. - Stop the yelling, Martin. Can't you just stop being so fucking uptight for once? Don't you see the, whatever you say, whatever you're gonna say, it just doesn't fucking matter. Do you think, I don't know what happened. Murder is such a serious fucking thing. What are you telling me this for? Do you wanna know what a great guy your friend Johnny was? - 6 Million bucks? Who the fuck deserves 6 million bucks? - [Grant] I could find a few uses, man. - Man, you could pay up my markers for a start. - Your markers' passed on, man. It's baseball. It's, it's, you know, they're like, today's version of gladiators or something. - Gladi- I got a theory about that. - Got a theory about that. You even know what a theory is. - Yeah, I a theory is. - Can you spell it? - Listen, those guys are playing a game. I think I should have big stakes. - Big stakes. - Big stakes. - Big stakes. - Yeah. Like the $10 slots or something. - Like $10 slots. It should be life or death. - It's the $10 slots to me. - Yeah, for you and Martin. This is what I think. If those guys are playing baseball, they should, the winning team should, should choose one player from the losing team. They all line up and take turns whacking somebody. Whacking 'em, whacking em' til he's dead, finished. - I hate to be on the Dodgers. - You know, that's incentive to win. I mean, that's, you know, that's what it's all about. Competition. - It's baseball guys. It's guys in tight pants, you know, hitting the ball with the, with with a stick. It's like glorified golf or something. There's Amy. Hey Amy. - Hey Grant. Hey Johnny. What's going on? - My gal around? - Yeah, she's at your house. She just go off work. - She know about tonight? - Yeah, 9:30, right? - Yeah. Well, Martin doesn't get off to 9 though. - Well, I guess we'll see you later tonight. - Okay, bye. - Bye-Bye. - Damn, she's fine. - Stay away from Amy. You understand? You're in enough trouble as it is. - Look, just turn around and drop me off at the Frontier, will you? - What are you gonna do? You gonna gamble? What are you going to the Frontier for? - I'm just going to the Frontier. Just turn around and drop me off. - Why? What are you gonna do there? - I'm gonna go see a guy about a thing. Just turn around. - See a guy about a thing. You're gonna gamble. I'm not taking you to the Frontier. I'm not taking you to the Frontier Johnny. This is my car. You're in my car. You're going where I'm going? You're going to my house. - I'm not gonna go to your fucking house. You're gonna make me walk. - Come with me to my house. We know where you're going. - Just drive the car around, drop me at the Frontier. You go to your house. - You want me to take you all the way up to the Frontier? - I don't wanna walk back to the fucking Frontier. - You don't have any money. You're in trouble as it is. We're not going to the frontier. - Alright, alright. Fuck it. I'll just get out of the car. - Hey, hey, come on. Just Johnny, what the are you doing, man? Johnny get in the car! (rock music intensifies) (funk music) (punches) - Take it easy. What the fuck is wrong with you? He's just a fucking kid. Just a college kid. Man, he's drunk. - I want a drink. Let's have a drink. Come on and get a couple drinks. Well, you won't always be around to stop me slick. - Where were you tonight? You were over an hour late. - I was? - Yes you were. - I was out back doing a horizontal Mamba with Amy. - I thought I told you to check that shit, Johnny. What the fuck are you doing? - Don't fuck with me tonight. Grant. Don't with me. - Fuck with you? What the fuck are you doing with that? What's that about? - It's pretty fucking amazing what kind of respect do you get from one of these things. - What do you need respect for? Put that fucking thing away! Are you stupid? - It's this fucking town, Grant. It's the fucking town. It makes you bet money you don't have. That's okay if you win, but if you lose, you're screwed. It's gonna come knocking at your door. - How much you down? - Are you gonna help me out on this? - How much you down? - You got 25 grand? - Didn't we talk about this shit in the car? - Talk, talk, talk talk. All you do is fucking talk. Go pay off my markers. I got an idea. I'm gonna take this place tonight, Grant. It's gonna be fucking cake. All you gotta do is hang with me. You're my alibi. - Are you fucking crazy? You are acting like one desperate motherfucker. - Yeah, I am a desperate motherfucker! What? - You fuck! - I fucking nailed your ass. - I'm kill you right here. - What are you gonna you do shoot me, huh? - I'm gonna shoot. - You gonna shoot me? huh? - What are you doing?

You shouldn't have done that. Oh yeah. Martin's out there too. You must not forget him, man. He's too important, what with having the money to buy us these beers. What? - What? - What? What the fuck? Huh? You pissed about that little thing out there? - Am I pissed about that thing out there? You say, am I pissed about that thing out there? Yes, I'm fucking pissed about that thing out there, Johnny. What the fuck were you doing? - I just got something going on in my head. Is that okay with you? - It's no. No, it's not okay. - Fucked no Rockstar. - And you don't want to either. - It was a joke honey. - You been fucking some rockstar behind my back. - Just meatloaf that one time. - Back at the Bingo. - Enough of that fucking Meatloaf, Johnny Cash. I'm talking about Elvis. I'm talkin' about Elvis. - [Gale] Oh God. - I'm saying we buy maybe two or 300 of these no Elvis stamps. We mail 'em off to some up fucked up address and they'll come back to us as fucking gold. - What? What am I missing? - You send 'em all off and they'll come back to us, stamped return to sender. - I get it. - It's money in the bank. - [Gale] I know, it's a stupid idea. - [Amy] No it's not stupid. - That's gotta be the dumbest thing I've ever heard. - You don't get it either. You're an asshole. - Don't you think somebody's already thought of that? - [Johnny] You're an asshole. - Fine. - Fucking asshole. - You're an asshole. - Could you just don't be an asshole, alright. I want you to do something for me tonight. - What I ain't licking your Elvis stamps. - Just drive around this strip a few times and meet me back here in 20 minutes. - Why? What are you gonna do? - I'm going to the Frontier. I'll be back here in 20 minutes. - Going to the frontier? You ain't got no money to gamble. - Grant, look. Just. Fuck, just do it, alright. - Do what? - Drive around the strip a few times. Meet back here in 20 minutes. I'm going to the frontier. I'll be back in 20 minutes. - What are you do? You gonna rob that place? You gonna rob the fucking frontier? You know what kind of security they got there? - I'm only gonna ask you one more fucking time, Grant. A friend in need. - I'm only gonna tell you one more time. No. - Someone's gonna come knocking on my door tonight. And I don't wanna have to use this thing because there's no telling who I'm gonna use it on. You understand that? - What is that? Is that a fucking threat? Are you threatening me? - What's up? You two are acting like a bunch of - - Get outta here! - Yo Johnny, Jesus. - [Gale] What are you doing? Grant, what the fuck. (intense drumming music) - What the fuck are you doing? - I don't need you anymore. - Stupid Fuck! What are you doing, Johnny?

(gunshot) (ominous music) - [Amy] Oh my God. Oh my God. (ominous music continues) (Amy crying) - What are we gonna do? Oh my God. Oh my God. What are we gonna do? - Stop it Martin. We gotta get him outta here. We gotta get him into the car. Martin, help me get in the car. Just help me get him in the car. Come on. - What? - Help me. Get him in the fucking car. Get his feet. - Oh shit. Oh shit. - Martin, come on. Help me. - Oh! Fucking! (ominous music continues) (somber music continues) (windmills churn) - You're telling me Johnny was some kinda desperate thief, right? That it was his gun, not yours. That he was going to rob a casino last night and that you stopped him. - It just doesn't matter what I say, does it Martin? You're just gonna see and hear what you wanna to. - I knew about the gun too. Johnny showed it to me. I met him outside. That's where he showed it to me. - He showed it to you last night while you were putting your purse in the car. What else did he show you Amy? - A lot of things, Martin. (tires screeching) - I knew it was something like that. I did. And you wouldn't make that story up. - I believe you too. - We can't go to LA. - Why? Why not? Gale! - Listen to me. I never called my brother at the gas station. I called the cops. - You called the cops. - I had to do it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was gonna call my brother and then I got in there and I thought, for some fucked up reason I thought if I explained it was an accident, if I explained it was self-defense, they'd say, okay, you can go just drop the body off. I don't know why I thought it, but I did. And I didn't want Grant to get hurt. - And what about Johnny? - He's dead. What about you? What about me? What about Amy? We put a fucking dead body in the trunk of a car. A car I have described to the police. Oh fuck. - Well, let's, let's just stay on the back roads, okay? We can just, I'll figure it out. - What? Stay on the back roads? They know what we look like. We've got to get off the roads. We gotta get out of this car. Listen to me, Grant, baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I'm sorry. I called the cops. I thought I was helping you. But if you want to trust me now, if you wanna listen to me now I think if we get out of this car and go somewhere else, turn the other way, Texas. Utah, I don't give a shit, Colorado. We know people in Boulder. (helicopter hovering) - You girls are idiots. He's got you both thinking with your snatches instead of your brains. This is ludicrous. Grant, don't run anywhere. Go to the nearest town and turn yourself in. It's the only thing to do. - Do you, Martin? You do that. You do what you have to do and so will I. Gale, let's turn around. Let's go. (engine roaring) - We'll use the back roads. We can stay off the interstate. - That's where the cops will be. (windmills churning) (upbeat music) (music intensifies) (groan) (yelling) (tires screeching) (yelling) (tires screeching) (sirens) - You fucking jackass. You ruined my life. I'll kill you for it. (sirens) - Martin, please. (gunshot) (Gale yells) (gunshot) - Fuck Martin. What the are you doing? No! (sirens) - Martin! Martin! (gunshot) Stop it.
