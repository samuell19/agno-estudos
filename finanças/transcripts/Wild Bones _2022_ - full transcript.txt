Fay. Hello. Fay, Dad left us a house. He left us his house. You've spoken to Dad? No. No. Fay, he's gone, you know that. Dad's gone. Where are we going? I thought we could go for a walk by the seaside maybe, with a friend. Maybe just say hi and then we can get going. - Hi. - Who is he? This is... this is Gary. Gary, Fay. I want to stay here. But Fay, you love the beach. That's what mom said. You used to love it. Remember? Maybe in the summer. The beach. Well, is it okay, if we stay here? Even just five minutes will be great, it's so cold. Yeah. I just want to spend some time with you. Okay, yes. This is my kind of place. I'd love to come here and get away from it all. What would you be trying to get away from? Nothing in particular. It's just nice to go somewhere new. Yeah. Somewhere fresh. I'd still like to go to the beach sometime. To be beside the seaside. The sea makes it look like the Earth's been cut open. It's like an enormous wound that won't heal. Where's the toilet? It's just upstairs. Do you mind if I just use it? Yeah, okay. Okay, cool. Thanks. Won't be long. Are you cold? No, I'm fine. So, you're Alice's famous big sister? What? Alice, she's told me about you before. What did she tell you? Nothing. Nothing, really. Yes, she did. Of course, she did. What did she say? She said you're an amazing dancer. I'm not a dancer. Why would she say you were? They wanted me to be a dancer. Didn't like the way I moved. So not a dancer then? Alice doesn't know me. Your mom was a dancer, wasn't she? No, my mom wasn't. That's Alice's mom, not my mom. I was always told that love was wise, and hatred was foolish. What did Alice tell you about me? Nothing. Okay. You shouldn't believe everything my sister tells you about me. Not everything she says is going to be right. I won't believe what she tells me about you if you promise not to believe everything she says about me. She hasn't told me anything about you. Well, if she does. Well, it looks like I've got to get to know you my own way, then. I guess so. Okay, first love? What? Who was your first love? My dad. My first love was my dad. It was always my dad. Okay, that makes sense. Tell me about him, then. My dad? My dad made me feel safe, fearless. He kept me from harm. Are you close with your family? Close enough. My dad used to say, "The one thing you'll always have is family." You can lose everything else in the world, but you'll always have family. Which means you'll always have love, which means you'll always be warm. Not cold. Warm. Love is important. It is. It is important. All three of us. He's gone. Dad left us the house. You know that? What are you doing? Sorry. Sorry, I... What are you doing with that? Uh... - Alice! - It's dad, isn't it? Yeah. Are you okay? I'm fine. What was that song that you said dad used to sing to you? Can't remember. You can. You can't of forgotten that. I know the song, I just don't know what it's called. Will you sing me a bit? No. Please? I thought you didn't want to talk about dad anymore. I don't really care what we talk about, as long as you know, as long as we're talking. Sing for me? Here. Don't open it yet. Just wait till I'm gone. Have you thought any more about the house? What house? Dad had a house. It went to her and now it's ours. I was hoping we could go together, maybe all three of us. She doesn't deserve a single thing of him. She does. Fay she's got it. She's got the keys to the house and if you want them, you're going to have to go see her to get them. Alice and her mum are trying to convince me I can't take care of myself. Why is that? They think that because they can't understand their own actions, or they don't understand what being... I think I understand. Gary said that you might be seeing him. I'm seeing him soon. You like him, I can tell. He's fun, but nothing more than that. Is he helping to make you feel better? I feel better by myself. Okay, that's good. You don't like talking to me about what's going on with you, do you? Not everything needs to be talked about and explained. Is it true that when you were little, you never spoke until dad left? Didn't need to speak till dad left. Why not? Didn't need words. Fay... we worry so much about you. Both of us do. Have you thought any more about the house? Have you forgotten? We're not going unless you come with us. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's just us? Yeah. It's just us. You ever been with her? With Alice? With Alice. Would it bother you if I had? Don't know. Won't know till you tell me. Does it bother you to tell me the truth? No. The truth doesn't bother me. What's Alice like? What do you mean? What's she like? Tell me a story. What kind of story? A story without words. I don't want to get that on your teeth. Go like that. I think that's okay. Hang on. You've grown up so much. That's nice. Will you sing me dad's song? No. Just tell me the first line. Why? I want a bit of him too. I want to share. Thank you. We should get ready. Fay, could you just tighten these for me? Just a bit tighter. - Like that? - Yeah. What are you doing? Nothing. You look really pretty. Thanks. Do you want to put yours on too? Yeah, okay. All those hills feel like dad. Will it be able to get to us here? Should we walk down and meet it? Come on. Let's go. Wait. No, we're not going tonight. Alice. No. Fay. Alice, come on. No. Don't. No. Just... I don't. Just... Did you make it disappear? Didn't know you smoked. Don't really. Except when I drink. I can put it out. Sorry. It's okay. I used to love watching you dance. Mom always wanted to dance with you more. She loved the way you're able to dance. How are things with Gary? I've asked him to move in with me. Really? Yeah. It's quite soon. Is it? Yeah. Do you think I'm making the right decision? - No. - Why not? It's just... I just think it's a bit soon. Well, the cat's gone. Where did the cat go? I don't know. Did you make it disappear? What did you say? You should bring him around to meet mom. The cat? Gary. I'm not going to do that, Alice. I wouldn't have brought the fucking cat either. You really need to go and see her. She really wants to see you. She needs to see you. You don't know who she really is. Do you think it was really mom who did those things? Do you think I wanted it to happen? It was dad who left. He didn't leave. Mom told me everything about him. He was a violent man. He left us. Mom said both you and him share wild bones. This is our first night together, just you and me. We should make it special. Okay. We should tell each other something we've never told anybody else before, secrets that can be shared just between us. It means you're locked together by something only the both of you know. That's something that's forever. Okay. You don't agree? Secrets are things that just come out and change the way someone looks at you, changes the way people talk to you. You're treated different when someone knows who you really are. Every time we see each other, I look at you differently. But that's only because I feel closer to you each time. I just want to be as close to you as I can be. I just want to be closer. Tell me your secret. Why don't you tell a secret? Then I'll know how much you trust me and what sort of secret I should tell you. You want a secret? I want your secret. Alice's mom used to bend my bones out of shape and twist my arms and legs till they were close to snapping. She used to stub her cigarettes out on my arm and she's the reason my dad was taken and is still missing. You shouldn't say those kind of things. It's not fair on me. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm sorry about earlier. I think... Fay. How could you possibly know someone who's been dead that long? Mom said both you and him share wild bones. Fay. Mom said both you and him share wild bones. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Mom said both you and him share wild... For fuck sake, will you please fucking say something. All I ever did was try to help you. All I ever did. I fucking saved you from that monster. All you've done is try to punish me. You're absolutely nothing. What's wrong with you? You fucking dark evil fucking piece of shit. I've fucking tried to do everything with you. I cannot fucking do anything else. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you. Fay. Okay, I'm going to let go. I'm going to let go. I'm going to let go, okay? If you promise me not to run. Okay, do you promise? We're going to look after each other, okay? We've got to look after each other. Okay? It's me. Okay. Okay. Okay. I need to clean up. I'll take care of it. No, I've got it. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah. What are you looking for? A razor. I'm looking for my razor. Has it ever been in that drawer before? Yeah. Well, yeah, that's where I thought I left it. It just disappeared. You okay? Yeah. I'll miss you while I'm gone. I'll miss you, too. How have you been? Me? Yeah, how are things with you? Hanging on, you know? It's just me and mom in that house now, so just rattling around, you know? You should move out. I can't leave her there. You should. But why would I want to leave her there? Doesn't she hurt you? We'll wash that out now, I think. Come here.

Fay, I need to talk to you about Gary. He's not an honest man. How was your trip? Yeah, fine. It was really boring. Where were you? Wisbech. Yeah, two days in Wisbech. Is everything all right? I'm fine. Not hungry? I'm only peckish. You should eat then. One of the last things my dad said to me. He told me at some point when I was older, I'd find myself alone. He told me the only person I'd ever really be able to rely on is myself. And he told me to promise him that I'd do everything I can to do the right thing. He told me behind doors are secrets, and underneath the skin is the truth. No protection, just truth. It's all skin is, the thing stopping us seeing what's inside of each other. Your dad sounds like a wise man. Do you love me? I love you. Do you? I'm tired, Fay. That was really nice. I'll let you finish. My fucking tongue! Stop, please, stop. I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? Who I am, my family. Your family? My daughter. Let me tell you. You're nothing. You can help me. I need you to help me. I was going to tell you Fay... I was going to tell you... When I come back, you better not be here. If you are I'll fucking turn you inside out and show everyone what you are. Shh, please. No, no, I don't know where I am. And everything just feels really dangerous and it just grabs at the core of me and throws me into space and around the room and it hurls me into the concrete and into the floor and into the wall and I don't where I am and it is constant, and it comes in these huge fucking waves, these giant fucking waves. It never ends. It's a constant fight and it never ends. Fay, you've got to leave this place. There's nowhere else for you to go. She knows I've got someone here, but she doesn't know it's you. She knows. And I know, you're hurting because of Gary and everything, but... Gary is nothing. It's dad, and it's her, and it's the things she's done. All I've known is Mom. She loved me and she stuck around. She's here for both of us. Do you know what she did? First we were at the beach, that's why you think I love the beach, because that's where we were, when he was gone. We're there together. Then we weren't. Why were you at the beach? Because he saw her. She was hurting me and he saw her, and he hurt her. He took me away, and told me he was going to make everything better. Then I turned around and he was gone. - You went back home? - I went back, I went upstairs, and held onto his things. I just breathed them in because I knew. A part of me knew he was slipping away, and she called me outside and she made me throw everything he owned into the fire and watch it burn. - Why? - Because then she had me. It's all she's ever wanted, control. Take your coat off. I've been waiting for you. What for? Sunday lunch, Christmas. I'm playing with you, love. I'm pulling your fucking arm. Did you hear about Davina's Nathan? Davina's Nathan, that boy. Of course you don't remember. He's not been seen for six months now. He's another one they reckon is sleeping. That's what we used to say about about your Da' wasn't it? We used to joke about it. Him shutting his eyes, sleeping. He's taken you to some lonely places Fay. A long list of lonely places. Forever leading you to that lonely spot. I take it that's why you're here. What? The house. Dad didn't have a house. Of course he did. It was your father's. And I thought it was time to make you go there and see who he really was. - I know who he really was. - No, you don't. - Yeah, I do. - No. Do you want one? You were always nicking my fags. No, I weren't. I know you. I know you. I know what simmers inside, and I know what's in your body and in your guts. Your Da' always told you there was a light in there. There was shit. You and him were a right pair of cunts. There's always fucking pain wherever you are. You were pain. All I ever did, was try to help you. I wanted to make you a better person. I wanted you to be better, not this. You used to burn me. Oh, shut up, Fay. What are wild bones? Tell me. Wild bones belong to people who aren't people at all. They're people who are animals wearing human skin. That doesn't mean anything. It means everything. You're not made up like the rest of us, you, or you're Da'. You're dirty, you're filthy pigs. You're animals, you're not human. And just you think about that, you think about what that means, because being human is everything. It's what gives us more to live for than just surviving and dying, but those two things, they are constantly swirling around you and your Da'. You're a typhoon of fucking misery. Being human means seeing what's really there in front of you and living with that and working to make things better. Oh, he fucking had you. He fucking had you. He fucking had you, he fucking had... ♪ My love is just for you ♪ ♪ If yours is just for me ♪ Fay?
