["When Your Boy Becomes A Man" by Morris Erby] * When your boy becomes a man * It's a glad thing * You've done the job that you've set out to do * * You helped the lad to grow * Taught him all you know * 'Most everything that's him is you * * The starch in his stance * The power in his glance * The way he smiles * Or doesn't smile * The things that make him glad * * The things that make him mad * All the things that make him your child * * When your boy becomes a man * It's a sad * Glad thing * [crickets chirping] [animal whimpering] [laughing] [animal whimpering] [animal squealing] [animal growling] Uncle Jesse. - It's you, Skeeter? - 'Heard it again, uncle Jesse.' Imagination. Nothing like a boy's imagination and him growing. But I hear it again. Heard it as plain as day. This side of the river. [grunting] Heard it over yonder. Like a ghost laughin'. Only it wasn't scary. That ain't no way to tote an axe. Way to go with a shotgun. Wished I had me a shotgun. (Skeeter) Yes, siree, bobtail. Little old renegade. [animal whimpering] Yonder up ahead, just like you said, Dead ahead. And plain as day. Downwind from us now. Smell us sure. Might as well rest a bit. Uncle Jesse. Yeah. Did I ever have a mama? Of course you did, boy. Wasn't no finer woman in all Mississippi than your mama. And hair like that foxfire across river, I told you that. Never told me about my papa. Rain's heading in. It's coming quick. Do I ask Mr. Cash down the store? I reckon he'd tell me. Knows something about everything. Mr. Cash does. That so? Don't like him. So, reckon I won't ask him. Loves a nickel more than a goat loves a gourd vine Mr. Cash does. Skeeter, don't you go to running down old Cash like everybody else do. It weren't for Cash, you'd be at the orphanage these 12 years. I'd be a demon to tell you. Reckon the cabin will be getting too small for you to recline. Maybe the swamp, too. You run into the wind and be flyin' off one of these days. Everybody was at your mama's funeral from nigh, except me, and Papa. Me being her only brother, I fetched you here. And folks got to talking. See, it ain't fittin' and right for.. ...an old coward Jesse Jackson rear boy. Got no call to low-rate yourself, Uncle Jesse. Then old Cash put a stop to that orphanage talk. "That boy is the swamp's proud, he says. "Oh, Jesse is a swamp hickory. "They belong together, just like seed and the burrow. "Leave 'em be", said old Cash. Mr. Cash said that? Sometimes, I wonder though do I did you right? You learn a young ones a heap of things at the orphanage. I know a mess of things. Read and I can write. Go to school, don't I? Do, the road be passable, you go. You learn me to grab a snake by the tail and snap off it's head. They learn you that in an orphanage? Reckon not. They learn you how to catch a gator and sell the hide? - Reckon not. - Or how to hunt bee gums? And cut a Cypress knee so it'll sell good. They learn you why that river makes that singing sound.. ...when the moon's just right? Be John Brown. Wonder what they do learn young ones at the orphanage. [wind howling] Wind's shifting. My papa's name is Claude? Same as me? Yeah. I never could go with that name. I always called you Skeeter. You want that I should call you Claude? Rightly fine name, Skeeter. [laughing] That's it! Great day in the mornin'. Come on. Wonder what it is. Dog. Lickin' itself like a cat. Don't know a dog lick itself. That dog do. [laughing] Can't no dog laugh. That dog can. It smells us. Can't nothin' smell that far. [melodic music] I'll be John Brown. It smelled us. Can't nothin' smell that far. But that thing did. Whatcha think, Uncle Jesse? Just ain't natural. Like a dog crossed with a cat. And dogs and cats ain't supposed to cross. Like I told you, sorta figured on catchin' it. How do you aim to catch something that can smell a mile and run like grease lightning? Might as well go home. [music continues] I aim to ask old Cash about this. Sharp as a brighter, old Cash is. Sorta hate to let Mr. Cash in on it. Let us have that sow for 23.75. Been carryin' this, from now a year. Here. Some day I'm gonna walk right in to his store and put every last bit of that money right on the counter. Then maybe I'll get me some score bar teeth. $65. Whoo! It's a heap of money. And there's only cheap 'lil buggers at that. [melodic music] Could I have a cup of coffee, uncle Jesse? Coffee ain't good for young ones. Makes the skin yellow. How big do I gotta be, till I get a cup of coffee? Oh, rightly bigger. Not big like in arms and legs but... sorta growed up inside. 'Like a few hickory nuts?' Reckon not. You know, it's rightly nice sittin' here by the fire. Me and you. Wanna catch that swamp stranger myself. Mr. Cash will try and hunt it down and maybe kill it. Me and Cash won't kill it, unless it jumps us. Get a few of his dogs, come sun-up and run it and see what it is. I'll be along? You'll be along. Did I laugh at your story? I'm rightly sorry. You said you heard it, I had no call to laugh at you. [chuckling] You know, there's one thing in the world I like better than hickory nuts. That's more hickory nuts. Get me them roebuckers I'm gonna eat a plate of hickory nuts And enough roastiness to kill a goat. Might get them roebuckers with a couple of gold teeth in 'em. You know, I seen a fellow once had six gold teeth. Phew! Say, bein' as you're going to the store better pick up some bakin' powder and salt and things. Want we should make a list? I'll remember. You'll make it out, or want me to do it? You need to practice. Bakin' powder. Never can remember how it spells. B-A, bay.. '...K-I-N, kin.' Bakin'. (Jesse) 'Well, yeah, Bakin's plain as day.' 'Shouldn't have to write it twice.' Don't put down powder. That's a jaw-breaker. Salt. Lard. Flour. Tobaccy. Put down chocolate drops. Chocolate drops? Don't think much of chocolate drops. Now, take gum drops. I mean, I rightly like gum drops. Me too, all of us like gum drops. Put down gum drops. Whoo! List this long, old Cash's is gonna want a quart of wood. I'll cut it before you get back. - I'm getting sleepy. - Go to sleep then. - Day-bust is still a ways off. - Aim to. [blowing loudly] [instrumental music] Goodnight, boy. 'Night, Uncle Jesse.' Say your prayers? Sayed 'em when you said goodnight. 'Ought to get on your knees to say your prayers. You don't get on your knees. And so...I say mine laying here in bed. Suits me and the Lord. 'Whatcha you pray for, Uncle Jesse?' 'Them roebuckers?' Mostly. Well, can I pray for that shotgun? I might get it? 'Might.' Well, can I pray I might catch that thing in the swamp? I might catch it? 'Might.' Do I pray for both? What about that? That's too much prayin'. It helps folks get themselves in a mess. Talkin' to the Lord is something you do easy. So, don't never crowd him, boy. [engine idling] [dog barking] Call that a quart of wood? You said you'd have a quart. It wouldn't cut hot butter. Skeeter, how come it cut so much wood with such a dull saw? 'You owe me a quart of wood.' You'll get your wood, but a man ought to be ashamed putting off a no good saw on a fellow. Skeeter, there ain't nothing wrong with that saw now, is it? Brought your dogs, didn't you, Mr. Cash? 'Course I did. Jesse told me you jumped something in the swamp. Ain't no telling what it is. Your dogs will get it. 'Best dogs in the county, Mr. Cash.' Jesse, go get your gun. Lets get going, I'll get my wood later. Get them groceries, Uncle Jesse? Sure, he did. Best list I ever seen, boy. Only you messed up baking. It's B-A-K-I-N-G. 'Spell it.' B-A-K-I-N-G. Now, don't forget it. 'Cause I ain't gonna be tellin' you again. You messed up flour too, but we get to that later. How about tobaccy? That's a jaw-breaker. Had it right. [bolts rattling] Come here, boy. Come on. [dog baying] What's his name, Mr. Cash? Gabe. Fastest dog in the country. He'll catch that thing. Hurt it? 'More likely not, just tree it.' It won't have a chance against them hog-dogs. You're not gonna turn 'em loose less than you have to. Ain't that so, Mr. Cash? I aim to see what that thing is. If Ol' Gabe can't catch it, Ol' Bark and Bello here will. 'They'd kill a bear, if they jump him.' But that thing ain't big much. 'Size don't count, Skeeter.' But it ain't hurt nothin'. Them dogs will kill it. If y'all telling the truth, I aim to have that thing. Don't bark, laughs. Licks itself like a cat. Skeeter, if I have to run it all the way to Mobil I aim to have it. Here, Gabe. [Gabe barking] Gabe catches it. Soon as he hits the trail, he'll bait-ho! Come on, Bello. Come on. Come on, Bello. Come on. [dogs barking] Easy now. Hold it, Bark. [Gabe barking] Here's where we seen it, Cash. Right over yonder. Sittin' on that log-walk. Licking itself, just like a cat, and laughin'. [Gabe barking] Never knowed him to take so long, something's wrong. He's messed up. That thing's just another dog. Gabe ain't used to huntin' dogs. Might as well go on home, that thing's long gone. [Gabe barking] Got it. He's got somethin'. [barking continues] That thing's runnin' hard. Gabe ain't even about to tree it. [Bello and Bark barking] Yonder it is. It outrun Gabe. Be John dog running braggit. [barking continues] Go get him, Gabe. Bello's comin' in. [dogs barking and snarling] Keep that head low, Bello. [barking continues] - Get off! Get off! - 'Bello, get off him.' 'Get off him, Bello, Gabe." 'Come on, boy.' - Come on. - He got away. Bark, Bello, you slab-sided devil, shut up. Outrun Ol' Gabe. Jumped my hog dogs, both of them. The dog did out-done it! I'm gonna tell you something. Anytime a thing can outrun my Gabe and whoop my hog dogs I ain't messin' with it, it's got a right to live. I know when I'm whooped. I'm goin' home. I ain't gonna say nothin' about that little thing out yonder. Somebody's liable to hunt it down. - Come on, here. - I'm gladly obliged. Thought'll be like it's mine, me seen it first. Don't you say nothin' about that little ol' thing out-running Gabe. And whoopin' my hog dogs. Come on, boy. [slow instrumental music] Maybe you won't need me tomorrow. Them corns gotta be cut, but I reckon I can do it myself. Well, I'd like to go out and get that thing. By yourself? Yes, sir. Maybe you're aimin' to whittle it up. No, sir. I aim to take food out in the swamp and just wait. Got a feelin' that thing wants us, as much as I want it. Like a little coffee? I'd like a little coffee. [coffee trickling] Put some cream in it. You drink yours black. Well, that's different. I'm grown up. That's enough. [spoon clanking] Pretty good coffee. Yes, sir. That's pretty good coffee. How do the elements look? Rainsy, up there. [door closing] It ain't gonna rain. It's a mighty fine day. One of the good Lord's best, I reckon. You see, he worked hard on this one. Tuckered hisself out, maybe. But he made it just right. - Well, I'll be gone. - 'I'll be around Takes after his mamma, thank the good Lord. His papa's hidden. Walks like his papa too but.. ...takes after his mamma. [water gurgling] [birds chirping] [motor whirring] [snoring] [squirrel chattering] * Who came to the river and couldn't get across * * Pay five dollars for an old blind horse * * Wouldn't go ahead nor he wouldn't stand still * * So he went up and down like an old sawmill * * Went out to milk and didn't know how * * Milked the goat instead of the cow * * Monkey sittin' on a pile of straw * * Winkin' at.. [instrumental music] How come you're slippin' up on me like this? Why don't you come here? Don't run away. Now, come on! Come back here! Don't run away, little ol' puppy dog! Ain't going to hurt you. Wouldn't hurt you for nothin'. Please don't run away, little ol' girl dog. Got no cause to tremble, little ol' puppy dog. He ain't nothin' but a little ol' dog. Little old girl dog. [instrumental music] She's cryin'. Be John dog if she ain't cryin'. Never seen no dog that could cry before. [dog barking] Now, you're laughin'. Come on, let's go home. Me and you. Come on. [motor whirring] [snoring] (Skeeter) 'Uncle Jesse, I got it. I got it, Uncle Jesse!' [motor whirring faster] [saw screeching] I got it. I told you I'd get it! Well, now, I do declare. That ain't nothing but a little old dog. Little old girl dog. Does she ought to be barking and growlin', she just laughs. - Do tell. - It's so. Wonder how she'd get around here. Don't know, Uncle Jesse. But I found her. She's mine. Hey, that dog's been around folks. She belongs to somebody. Belongs to me, I found her. Yeah. That dog's a fern dog. Maybe it's a Yankee dog. You know how funny Yankees are. I don't know much about Yankees, thank the good Lord. But that dog's been around folks. Don't belong around here. It does now. Got me a dog, Uncle Jessie. You sure have, boy. What you aim to call her? Ain't thought about it. Maybe, Dicksie. Half the dogs in this swamp's named Dicksie. How about Pal? That ain't nothing to brag on, either. All the dogs ain't named Dicksie's named Pal. - And what about Trey? - How come you think of Trey? I used to know a song about a dog named Trey. "Old Dog Trey." That'll be John Brown. How come you think of Trey? You used to sing that song when I was a little boy. That's how come. Well, now I do declare. You remember that, huh? Well, that's a fair name but it's for a boy dog. Now, look. I don't want to butt in. You found her, she's yours to name. I want that you should help me name her. Well, how about...Gertrude? - Gertrude? - That's a pretty name. No, I don't think much of it myself. I reckoned you wouldn't. Knew a lady named Gertrude once. Way back long before you got here. She had pansy eyes and.. ...was pure as just a God. She punied up and died a long time ago. - We'll name her Gertrude. - Not unless you want to. But that dog is a lady just like Gertrude was. Keeps herself as clean as a coon. Why, she don't even smell like a dog. She's a pure G lady. Then let's call her "Lady". How that sound? Lady. You got it. Now, there's a virgin name. Huh, Lady? We got us a dog. Ain't we, Uncle Jessie? Ain't we, Lady? Well, I don't aim for nobody to take my dog. I have found her and she is mine. [instrumental music] Hear me, Uncle Jessie? Ain't nobody goin' to take my dog. I hear, Jamie. Ain't nobody gonna take your dog. Come on, lets get some sleep. I've got to get that wood cut tomorrow. [music continues] [birds chirping] [Lady whimpering] Water rat! Ain't you got good sense? Don't go runnin' into the water after things. Snake or gator will grab ya. Didn't go to hurt your feelings. Didn't want you to go get killed. Just doin' it for your own good. Now you are gonna stay right here and wait for me. It's buttermilk day and I gotta go over to the Watsons'. You ain't going. Now, stay there. Stay. [Lady whimpering] Lay down, stay right there. None of that bawlin' neither. You gotta learn when I mean business and I mean business. Now lay down. Lay down. Now stay there. Stay there. 'Hi, Skeeter.' - 'Hi.' - 'Hi, Skeeter.' - Hi, Skeeter. - Hi, Skeeter. - Hi Skeeter. - Hi Skeeter. - Hi, Skeeter. - Hi, Skeeter. - 'Hi Skeeter, hi.' - 'Hi, Skeeter.' - 'Hi, Skeeter.' - 'Hi, Skeeter.' How do ya'll Bonnie do? About time you got here. Come in and visit a while. Ain't go long, just get my buttermilk and head on back. Thanking you just the same. 'What you gawkin' at?' 'Think you never seen a white boy before.' Scat! Scat, all of you. And you, too. [chuckling] How come Jesse Jackson don't cut your hair? - Aims to, one of these days. - Come on in the house. Got a pitcher of sweet milk just waiting. Boys like you need sweet milk. Don't like sweet milk. Like coffee myself. Coffee? You mean to stand there and tell me Jesse Jackson lets a young one like you drink coffee? All I want. Had me a big cup just before I left the house. He ought to be shot with a wash tub. Where's Gates? Oh, he is out yonder somewhere. You ask him about coffee. Jesse Jackson, ain't worth the salt to take the field. And toolings at the fans slot. Howdy, Skeeter. How you been? (Skeeter) Pretty good. And you? Ain't complaining. Everything alright at over your place? - What makes you say that? - 'Something's eatin' you.' Nothing much. Just me and Uncle Jesse had a talk last night about dogs. Know anything about dogs, Gates? What's on your mind? Uncle Jesse says that almost any kind of a dog can be trained to hunt birds. I say that only bird dogs can hunt birds. 'I'm on your Uncle Jesse's side.' You can train a dog to do 'most anything. Except maybe.. '...laugh, cry, things like that, and talkin'.' I'll tell Uncle Jesse that you said he was right. This little talk Uncle Jesse and me had.. ...no words, no hard feelings. Just talk, you know how it goes. You drop by anytime you're over this way. Much obliged. Just happened to think, Gates. Been hearing anything funny over in the swamp lately? Like a haunted laughing? Not a thing. [rooster crowing] Heard anything about anybody losin' a dog or something? Not a thing, Claude. [car horn] Howdy, Cash. Come for your wood? Wouldn't do me no good if I did. The trouble is, you sold me a saw that ain't worth a hooray. Work myself to a frazzle tryin' to keep it sharp and oiled. And then it does itself up for little old sticks of stove wood. Come here, Lady. Come here. Leave it alone, Lady. Going to make a bird dog out of you. Sure as the Lord made little apples. You can't go chasin' rats or coons and stuff like that. Here me? [Lady whimpering] Cut that out, Lady. That'll learn you to mess with rats. Stop that bawlin'. Now stay there. Tell you the truth, Cash. We already got us a dog. The boy.. Shh. [chuckling] Oh no, so that's it. 'That's the thing that out run Gabe and jumped my hog dogs.' Mornin', Mr. Cash. How do you like my dog? Well it's a.. It's a dog alright, I.. I ain't never seen nothing like it but it's a dog. 'Rat runner, huh?' 'Cash told me that he is going to stick around' 'so I told him you caught that thing.' (Cash) 'But you didn't tell me much.' Never seen such shut mouthed folks about a dog. What you two up to? Aim to hide her? Can't hide a dog. Good lookin' dog too. - She does alright. - Does she sure enough laugh? Plain as day, cries too. [laughing] That's the beatenest thing I ever heard of. What is she good for? Just rats? Hunt anything. Aim to make a bird dog out of her, don't we Uncle Jesse? Can't nothin' stop us from tryin'. Mr. Cash, you know what kind of a dog I found myself? I ain't even beginnin' to about to know. Well, you know anything about anybody losin' a dog? Ain't nobody around here lost that dog. I know one thing though. 'Boy just found himself a dog.' Finders keepers too, ain't it, Cash? Finders keepers. That the way things is around here. Got somethin' to show both of you. Come on, boy. Come on, boy. Come on, boy. Here, come on. Come on out here, boy. [Jesse barking] - What's his name? - Mallard Fillmore. Sir? I said Mallard Fillmore. That's his name. What you doing namin' a good dog a crazy name like that? Tryin' to be funny? Ain't you ever heard of Mallard Fillmore? I have been around here all my life. Never hear no such name from man, boy, dog or goat. Horse or mule neither. Mallard Fillmore was the President of United States. Never heard of him. Must not have mattered much. So, I never heard of him. Nobody ever named nothin' after Mallard Fillmore. - Lot of name to call a dog. - Well, I aim to call him Mill. But he is registered Mallard Fillmore. Registered? I ain't never seen a registered dog before. Ain't leavin' are you? Reckon your uncle Jesse will tell you how come I drove out here with my dog. Reckon you oughta tell him, Cash. I reckon I will. It's my place to tell him. I brought Mill over here figurin' you and Jesse might look after him. Work him for me. Figured something like that. You all didn't aim to keep that dog around the store. - He needs workin'. - But you got a dog. Never knowed you'd found a dog till I came out here. Got room for two dogs. I'd feed him good and take him to the swamp every day. No. I reckon not. Why don't you come right out and say it, Mister Cash? My dog ain't good enough to run with yours. Now you actin' like I lower rated your dog, and I ain't. It's just that Mill's a very fine bird dog and there ain't no telling what yours is. He runs rats. If my dog runs with yours, he's liable of learning bad habits. I can't take a chance. My dog's in the book. Paid a $100 for him. Your dogs in the book and mine came from the swamp. - Well, I aim to keep mine. - I know how you feel. I reckon I'll take my dog, over to Watsons' and.. ...let Gates look after him. Just tell Gates, I said to keep your dog away from mine. And I'll keep my dog away from yours. You tell Gates, we both said that. 'Come on, Lady, heel.' 'Heel Lady, come on Lady. Heel.' Heel Lady, come on. Might as well get used to that rope. Ain't no other way to learn you. Now, heel. Come on. Come on, Lady. Heel. Come on Lady. Heel Lady. Can't learn nothing, sittin' on your tail. Now, heel. Come on. Now heel, Lady. Now heel. Come on, heel. Come on, Lady. Reckon we made a bird dog outta one end of you. We got ya off that swamp walk. Come on, Lady. Heel. Heel, Lady. Heel, Lady. Heel. [instrumental music] Heel, Lady. Reckon that's enough for now. Innit, middle sun? Can't no dog learn to heel a bit faster than you done, Lady. Maybe you've been trained before. You got another master, Lady? Wish I could make you understand. My heart went yonder, it's just that I love you so badly much. Bird dogs take a heap of trainin'. Come on, Lady. Come on, Lady. My legs are plum wore out. How about you, Lady? Wish that I had me a shotgun. Little old 20 gauge. Me and you and a shotgun. Yes siree, Bob Dale. Lady, come back here. Here Lady, Lady come back. [bird twittering] (Skeeter) 'Chicken killer, you killed one of Gates' hens.' 'Ain't you got good sense?' 'Folks in the swamp will shoot a chicken killin' dog.' Better, nobody find out you killed that chicken. Not even, Uncle Jesse. Gates will miss his big dominecker. Sure as the Lord made little apples. No, Lady. Lay down, stay there. [animal screeching] Ain't no use in whippin' you. Ain't scared of a whippin'. First rat you jumped, you didn't know better. Now you done it a second time. Only way is to shame you good. [instrumental music] Maybe she was just hungry. Maybe that's how come she did like she did. Rat dog. It ain't no two ways about it. You got a rat dog on your hand. Maybe she'll learn better. It's hard to break a rat dog. Might even be a chicken dog. Can't believe the rat on. Let her get a good bait of it. - How long? - All night. Maybe, tomorrow too. What do you think? Hmm. Dead rat ain't a rightly nice thing around the house. Like I told ya.. ...maybe she was just hungry. Any dog will go after a rat if he's hungry. Do she be hungry, how come she don't eat? Need a little stove wood. Plenty in the box. Won't hurt none to fill it. [instrumental music] Pink feathers, chicken feathers. Do you know you killed a chicken? Got yourself a chicken killer as well as a rat dog. [footsteps] [door slams] Can of bacon drippings is too full. I gave her a little bit of it. Grease make her hide slick. Good for the natures too. Now is that right, Uncle Jesse? Me trying to learn my dog to do right.. ...and you up and give her bacon grease. Is that right? You'd reckon not. Didn't mean to butt in. Felt sort of sorry for her. Hungry, hiding under the bed. Dead rat around her neck. It's alright. Just as long as I didn't do it. She's got to know I won't stand for no messin' around. Like me to read to you? Yeah, I'd like a little readin'. Can't think of nothin' I'd like any better right now. Except maybe.. ...some roasting ears or something like that. I should read about the spaceman? Let's have one about cowboys. You know me. You know how I...naturally caught in the cowboys. "Gun smoke at the Chuck Wagon." Sure sounds like a good 'un donut, Uncle Jesse. Oh! Hope it don't have too many big words in it. Big words sure ruin a story. (Skeeter) '"Lead flew like hailstones around the chuck wagon.' '"The pots and pans rang out like a shootin' gallery.' "And then the wind died away and there was stillness. "And gambling Dan lay dead with his broc.. "...brocaded vest turnin' red over his black heart. "Calgo blew the smoke out of his hot six-shooters "and jammed them back on his hips. "Then he whistled to his mustang waiting in the dry gulch. [whistles] ""Let's drift, partner," he said softly. "I'm ready now."" The end, Uncle Jesse. Sure was a good one. Cracker Jack. [instrumental music] Wonder how come ol' Cash didn't name that dog Buffalo Bill. Now, there's a name, there's a name. But Millard Fillmore? Said your prayers? Sayin' them. [instrumental music] Here, Lady. Come here, Lady. Learned that dog to heel yet? She's a huntin' fool. Whatcha mean huntin'? You standin' here tellin me that's a huntin' dog? I'm standing here telling you she pints anything. She's doing rightly good so far, Mister Cash. Well, just this morning I took her out and she cast. (Cash) What do you mean cast? Well, just like I told you. She cast this morning. I'm from Missouri. You got to show me. Come on, Lady. Heel, heel. - Mind's good. - You ain't seen nothin'. Me and the boy will show you a dog. [chuckles] (Skeeter) Remember, Lady. Like you did this morning. Hup, Lady, birds! I'll be John Brown. Castin' a show as I'm standin' here. Covering the field like a Beats all, castin' like a bird dog. Hound from pup to papa, but castin' like a bird dog. She's workin' fast. We'll lose her if we don't move on. Never seen nothin' prettier. Acts like she's huntin', but will she hunt birds? Ain't sayin'. Ain't tried to learn her to hunt birds. Not yet. [cicadas chirping] Now, there's Gates. What he's up to this side of the river? Howdy. Uncle Jesse. Chicken dog. She's pointin' chickens. She got birds. You're crazy. She's pointin' chickens. She got birds. I'm standing here telling you she got birds. It's chickens, Uncle Jesse. Ain't no use in sayin' it ain't. That dog's pointin' chickens. Go to your dog, boy. Flush them birds. Get her off that point. She'll stand there till judgment day. She's telling you she's got birds and you got to believe her! [instrumental music] [birds fluttering] Great day in the mornin'. My little old dog, my little old dog. Damn birds, casted, pointed and held. I told you she ate birds. Seen it myself. Me standin' right there and seen it. (Skeeter) My little old dog. my little old dog. A hunter born, a hunter bred. Can you shoot over? Ain't tried. Can't shoot quail until a cool spell hits. That'll be two, almost three months. Knowed she had birds. Said right out loud she had birds. And she had em'. (Gates) Sure was a sight. What them chickens doin' over yonder? Them your Dominickers, Gates? They're mine. Found a tree leaning across the river and got on this side. How many get across? (Gates) 'Seven.' Find em' all? Yeah, I found em' all. I lost seven, and I found seven. Sure enough? I'm rightly glad. Good seeing you, Gates. Drop by if your over our way. (Gates) Sure will, Claude. Let's go, Skeeter. Get a pencil and a tablet. You folks gotta have supplies. Yes, she... knowed she had birds. Spoke right out. She had em'. Supplies! "Yes, sir", said old Cash. "Jesse Jackson puts down one of the best lists "I've ever seen. "In this order, he's one of the best orders I ever filled. "I'm gonna frame this list, and hang it right "on the registry", he says. "Be John Brown, if I ain't. "Why an order like this is fittin' for a big house "or a revival meeting", he said. Oh, Uncle Jesse. Sure enough, is that what he said? Mm, said it right out loud and the Evan folks heard him too. Reginald folks will know who's got credit around here and who puts down the best list. Just look at all that good stuff. - Fed the dog? - Yes, sir. Gave her the last piece of that old meat and pork and beans. Give her some more. Give her a hunk of that fresh meat there. You and me is gonna have us a can of peaches. This has been a day. Whoo. (male narrator) Dark days came in steaming heat. And the moon was red and there was a ring around it. The boy wrapped wire around a stick and taught his dog to fetch. And when she bit hard, she learnt better. And then he got bird feathers and tied them to a pine cone. And she learnt to retrieve it without crushing the feathers. He worked her every day while Uncle Jesse cut Cypress knees in the swamp. (Uncle Jesse) I'll be John Brown. She picked that thing up just like she had a toothache. Beats all, get out, don't it? Yeah, mouth's gettin' rightly soft. Why don't I cut awhile? Cash said he could use all the cypress knees we could cut. You work the dog, I'll do the cutting. Hokes and Moby must be plum crazy paying out good money for something like this. It's mostly tourist folks who buy 'em. We had a tourist here once, a Yankee who got bit by a snake. Snake died. It's a fact. She laughs all the time now. Just laughs like she's doin' what she likes. Runnin' and huntin' and having herself a time. I do declare. [raining] [instrumental music] Cream? Cream. That's enough. Soon as it chills up, 'em birds are fittin' aim to shoot over em', break it to the gun. Then shoot me and you a massive partridge. Huh, Lady? (male narrator) And thus it was. And one day was like the next and the red moon wasted, and the circle went away. And autumn crept down from the north and brought the dry winds that blew the clouds high. And the ducks began flying. And all night they passed high against the moon. The swamp shook some of her leaves from her back and dressed down for the winter. And then the trees were naked and stark. And waved their hard, bare arms toward the river that was belly full and swelling yellow. [engine revving] Looks like he's got old Mill along. Up to something bringin' his dog over here. [car door shuts] - Brought old Mill along. - We was just saying it. - It sure is a pretty day. - Never seen one prettier. Bobwhites whistlin' through the broom straw. Nice nip in the air. Thought I'd come see ya'll, bring my dog with me. You are as welcome. Yes. Don't see why they can't run together. Mine and yourn. You had your say a while back, Cash. Now what you sayin'? Sayin' I was wrong that's what I'm sayin'. Keepin' mine on the other side of the river. Even Gates said I was wrong. Be rightly proud to have your dog run along side mine. Great day in the mornin' You are good to run with old Mill. What you mean... good? Means she'll learn from him. That's one reason why I brought him out. To help you out. That's rightly nice. How's her hard mouth? Been able to do anything about it? Sit. Sit. Sit. Now, stay. Stay. Go pick it up. Go pick it up. Go on, Lady, pick it up. Bring it here. Okay, Lady, bring it here. Come on. Mouth soft as eiderdown. She won't lose birds when real hunting time comes. Your dog do that, Cash? Your dog ain't toed? That's the trouble with you, Jesse, always wasting things like eggs and such. It ain't wasted. Me and the boy can eat it. Hup, Mill. Birds, birds, Mill. Hup, Mill! - Quick, ain't he? - Quick, alright. And merry hale, too. Hup, Lady, birds! She ain't casting, she just runnin'. It's her way. She run herself out. Bet she'll be all the way to Mobil pretty soon. Better slow her down if you aim to make a bird dog out of her. - She's on her point. - What you mean"point"? Because she ain't casting. If she's standing still, then she's got birds. Yeah, like the boy said, she's got a point. You call that a point? That's a squat. - She's got birds. - Where's she got birds? That clearin' is as slick as a skillet. Over yonder, by that old stump. - That's where our birds are. - Now, wait a minute. It's 50, 60 yards, that old stump. Ain't no dog can smell that far. He ran right by her. Ought to honor the point and backed her up. She ain't on no point, or old Mill would honor. She ain't got no birds and old Mill's still casting. Now, there is a point. He ran right by her. Didn't honor a point, didn't back her up. Your dog's pointin', alright, as pretty as I've ever seen but where are the birds? The birds are there, I'll flush 'em. I wish the season was on and I had my gun. - Old Mill's got a covey. - Sure has, Lady's covey. Don't stand there saying my dog sneaked another dog's covey. Keep your shirt on, I ain't low-rating your dog. I'm just tellin' he can't smell like Lady can. My dog is a bird dog. That thing of yours is a hound. Are you going crazy? There's quail by that stump. The boy's dog find 'em first. Mill can't smell as good as Lady can. That's why he ran by her. Got where he could smell the birds and went on the point. Pointin' the same birds Lady's been pointin' all along. Prove it. You throwed your bait, back it up or back down. But I saw-- You're tootin' for the sow and for groceries you done toked. I'm layin' the sow again, double what I owe ya. Fish and cut bait, Evans. I'm puttin' the sow on the line and I'm telling you that boy's dog's got no covey of birds over there. Not that distance. You go flush them birds. If she comes off that point-- You go flush them. It's right where Lady's been tellin' to stay on right along. Come on, now. Whoo! Great day in the mornin'! My little old puppy dog. [dog panting] I'm goin' home. You got yourself a sow, Jesse. - No hard feelings, Cash. - No hard feelings. I'm goin' home. Stop by our place and have a cup of coffee, maybe. No. I'll be goin' home. When I see a hound dog that laughs and points birds 50 yards away I've had enough. Don't believe it. The dog ain't been born that can smell birds at 50 yards. - It points quail at 50 yards. - Heard about it. Of course, you can't believe them swampers. I might drive up there and have myself a look. Wanna come along? I wouldn't miss it for all the catfish in Pascagoula River. It might be nice to bring a massive duck with us.. ...to show we meant to be neighborly. [gunshots] (Jesse) 'Folks, I was sittin' right here in this rocker. 'I'm tellin' you the boy found this dog in the swamp.' She can't bark at all, just laughs. The beatenest thing you've ever seen. 'Folks come from north, east, south, and west' 'to see this dog you're lookin' at.' Ain't been so much talk here since the big freeze of '17. I'll be obliged if you folks put your name in the book there. Daddy says I make the best pickaninny doughnuts ever. He wouldn't let me come along unless I baked you'll some. I'm rightly obliged, ma'am. Thank you. [car engine starting] Lady. Come here, Lady. The way folks been feedin' ya no wonder you won't eat bacon ribbons and oatmeal no more. [car approaching] Better get set, Uncle Jesse. Here come some more. [children shouting] - Alright, children, come on. - Come on. - Follow mama over there. - Hurry up. Come on. Come on, son, get out there. Come on children. Just don't believe it. Now, folks, I'm sittin' right here in this rocker and I'm tellin' you the boy found that dog in the swa.. Where's the boy? He's out in the ridges, doin' a little convincing. - What's on your mind? - Just dropped by. I'd like to have a look at the magazines I gave ya. Help yourself. What's on your mind, Cash? What's eatin' ya? Nothin's eatin' me, I...just dropped by. You ain't foolin' nobody, something eatin' you bad. This is it. Quit beatin' around the stump. Fella come out from Mobile last week to sell me some stuff. Heard folks in the store talkin' about that dog of Skeeters. Everybody's talkin' about her. He come back this mornin'. Showed me an ad in the magazine. Here it is. It's rightly nice of you to show me just like I could read. I ain't enjoyin' this, Jesse. I want you to know that. You, plain as day, ain't. I'm listenin'. What's it say? It's about a breed of dog. A.. A Basenji. Live in Africa. You don't say. One of the oldest breeds there is, Jesse. Goes way back before Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Way back before Moses, even. That old, huh? Older than that. Still a few of 'em left in Africa. Best huntin' dog there is. Lady? - She's got birds. - Funniest point I've ever seen. It's Lady, Jesse. Sure as shootin', she's one of them dogs. Do she live in Africa? What's she doin' way over here? Workin' up to it, don't shove me. I ain't shovin' you. '"Lost...Basenji female' '"Lost...Basenji female' '"in the vicinity of Pascagoula swamp' '"in the vicinity of Pascagoula swamp' "in Mississippi.' '"White blaze on chest and...white collar.' "Answers to the name of I...Isis of the Blue Nile. "Old Brook Kennels. "Old Lyme, Connecticut. "Liberal reward for.. ...recovery." Pretty name. Isis of the Blue Nile. Never heard a name like that. What's that got to do with it? They're talking about the boy's dog. I know it. Knowed it right off. Just wanted to put off thinking about it. [gunshot] Holds her point like she's deaf. Yeah. But is it 50 yards to where them birds was? One, two.. You mean, don't tell the boy? You mean, you aim to tell him? He'll find out. With all these folks flocking around here somebody will hear about it and tell him with the reward and all. It's your load. I'll towed it. But if it was me, I wouldn't tell him. That dog is the only thing that boy ever had that he could call his. No, I wouldn't tell him. That's you Cash and I am me. You know how to run a store and train bird dogs but me...I gotta raise the 'un. So I'll tell him. Like I said.. ...it's your load. Like I said, I towed it. Sixty, sixty one, sixty two, sixty three. Fifty yards is nothing. That little dog of yours pointed them quail at 63 yards! How do you want your eggs? I'll chop up some ham in little bitty pieces so you can chew it. Something eating you, Uncle Jesse? [sighs] Something I gotta tell you about. Lady? There's an ad in here about a lost dog. Isis of the Blue Nile. It's a funny name. (Skeeter) 'But they call her Blue for short.' He's talking about Lady. I never heard of a dog like that. - Bas-Bas.. - Basenji. Just never heard of a dog like that. He come from Africa. - How do you know? - Cash told me. Sure hated to tell me. Then how come he told you? Oh, I...sort of trapped him. Gotta get that ham chopped. It's Lady, alright. Ain't saying it ain't. Just saying I never heard of a dog like that. Dogs like that have been in Africa a long time. Long before, uh Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Before Moses, even. How do you know? Cash told me. How does he know? Someone from Mobile told him. If she belongs in Africa, then what's she doing over here? Somebody brought her over. Maybe, them folks in the ad. Brought her over here and got lost. It's about the way it happened. Well, I found her. I found her and "finders keepers." That's the way the saying goes and some folks holds to it. How do you hold? I ain't holding. You are the one who's doing the holding. Wouldn't know how to do, Uncle Jesse. What you think? I don't know what to do. I don't rightly know. Might keep still like nothing never happened. Then, again, there's a heap of folks who knows about it. Somebody might put two and two together. It's all a set reward. - Mr. Cash? - Never in this world. Cash loves money as good as the next man but not that good. But whichever way you jump, I'm jumping with you. You mean if I keep it, then it's...it's alright with you? They can bring the high sheriff, the governor even don't make no difference. If that's the way you want it ain't nobody taking no dog away from no one. Then I'm going to keep her. Then if that's the way it's to be.. ...let's get them ham and eggs. More likely, them folks apparently forgot all about her. It's an old magazine. She's been lost a long time. Put on some oatmeal too. No one around here much reads magazines except for Mr. Cash and Gates so I'm going to keep her. You said that once, there's no use to keep talking about it. [crying] I ain't hungry. You ought to eat. [slow music] Isis of the Blue Nile? You know it. You know it, alright. Know it but you don't like it. He'll find out. Can't help but find out. You'll never be mine anymore. My little old puppy dog. Poor little old puppy dog. [crying] You'd like a cup of coffee? We got to do it, Uncle Jesse. Well, it's like I said, you're doing the holding. It's your load, you got to towed it. I aim to tow it. Just don't know how to get in touch with them folks way up yonder and all. Hm, you should write them a letter. It'll take too long. Wanna get shut of it. Since I got to do it, I wanna do it quick. Well, maybe send them a telegram. No, don't know how to send one. Me neither, but Cash would know. Don't want Mr. Cash in it. Don't be hard on Cash, he couldn't help it. Gates would know. Gates knows about things like that. - I'm going over to see Gates. - Right now? Right now. You stay here, Lady. Dirty damn crazies! Not one crash and ditch. [whining] You telling them you found her, Claude? I got to. She ain't mine. I'm bound to tell them. We aim to send a telegram but me and the boy ain't never sent one. How you do it? I'm going into Pascagoula tomorrow. I'll send it for you if you want me to. Just walk in, big as you please, and tell them you aim to send a telegram for Jesse Jackson and his nephew.. ...about a dog. What you gonna tell them? That their Basenji has been found and where it is. That's all. Wait a minute, Gates. You knew about Lady. Knew all along. What makes you say that? The way you said the name right off. Easy as you please. You didn't even stare at the magazine. Basenji? You know'd about that dog? In a way, I did, I suppose. Since you put it that way. I knew right off, it was a Basenji and mighty valuable. Mr. Evans didn't know about it, I didn't know about it. How come you know'd about it? Well, I heard it down in the swamps about the same time you folks did, Mr. Jesse. A dog that couldn't bark, a dog that laughed. - So I read up on it. - You tried to catch her? Yes, sir. I knew she's worth a lot of money. Why didn't you tell me, Gates? How come you let me play all along like she was mine? I just did, that's all. I was down at the spring the day you found her. I put out baits, but she wouldn't come to me. (Gates) 'I saw her go to you.' 'And that's all there is to it.' Should have told me. Wouldn't have been so hard to give her up...at first. I wish now that I had. But I just couldn't tell you, Claude. 'You had yourself a dog' 'and I just couldn't throw you.' [slow music] I don't want Claude mad at me but I just couldn't tell him. He'll get over it. You done right. He'll get over it. I never saw anybody aching so hard, Mr. Jesse. (Jesse) 'It's mighty pretty writing, I can tell that.' 'But with my glasses busted, I can't read nothing that close.' My name's Grover, Mr. Jackson from the Old Brook Kennel in Connecticut. As soon as we got your telegram, I flew down to Mobile. - Rode in an airplane, did you? - Yes, sir. Well, now, ain't that something. Uh, is the dog here? It'll be back directly. Boy's out walking her somewhere. - Is she in good shape? - 'Fit as ever.' How is she eating? Same as us. Oatmeal, bacon fat, and things like that. A valuable dog like Isis should have meat once a day. Why, now, I do declare! Meat every day, huh? And here we've been feeding her the same sort of stuff we eat. You might as well come up and sit a while. I'm anxious to get back to Mobile. I can get a plane back home tonight. I don't wanna hurry you but I've come a long way for that dog. You sure have. What did you say your name was? - Grover. - First or last? Last. My name's Walden Grover. Was he a president too? [slow music] - If the reward isn't large-- - Reward? - Done forgot about that. - Alright. I don't own the kennel, I only work for it, Mr. Jackson. But I've been authorized to pay you a 50 dollar reward. - That's a lot of money. - I ain't saying it ain't. I'll pay you as soon as I get the dog. I don't want trouble, but legally.. Trouble? ...the dog belongs to us. You ain't gonna have no trouble, Mr. Grover. As soon as the boy gets back, well, you'll get your dog. No offence. I just thought you might not want to give up the dog. We don't, but she's yours. Naturally, I hate to take a dog away from a boy. Now, hold on a minute. Ain't nobody taking nothing away from nobody. The boy found your dog, and she's yours. But there ain't nobody taking nothing away from nobody. I didn't mean it that way. You know, I don't like this anymore than you do. This bozo is a bit touchy. Come on in and we'll have us a cup of coffee. Ain't no sense in us having a set-to out here about this thing, is it? Okay. Ain't never seen no pants like them before, Mr. Grover. [slow music] Ain't much but it's ours, mine and the boy's. I've never been inside a house like this before. It'll do. It's sort of crowded though. Figure on adding another room for the boy. He needs another room. Is that where he sleeps? Him and the dog. You know how it is with a boy and a dog. Yes, I know. Trouble with boys is... they grow up. [slow music] You just drive back down the road to Mr. Alfie Evans' store. Tell the old cashier, a friend of mine, and wait there. Me and the dog and the boy will be in as soon as he gets back. (Grover) If that's the way you want it, that's the way we'll do it. [car engine starts] [crying] Some folks say that old Jesse Jackson ain't no account. But I say it depends on how you look at things. If he said he'd bring that dog in, they'll bring him in. So why don't you sit down, take that load off your feet? Wait a minute, here they come now. Jesse, this here is Mr. Grover. You two done met. Howdy, but we ain't shook. This is Claude. Sorry, I was late. Didn't know you'd get here so soon. Here's your dog. You've taken good care of her, Claude. She looks good. She's a bit touchy right now. Washed her down at the bayou. She didn't like it. I'm sorry about this, son. In a way, I wish we'd never found out about her. Know'd all along I couldn't keep her. So, that's alright. Know'd something would happen. Here's your reward. You can count it. - Ain't no use of that. - It's a lot of money. It's a lot of dog. That's more that fifty dollars. It's a hundred dollars. The dog's worth every dime of it. I suppose, you'd be breeding her. Yeah, that's right. I was just thinking, with all that money maybe Skeeter could buy one of her puppies. Don't want one of her puppies. Then I'd always be thinking of her. If she's going.. ...then I want her to go.. ...and not always to be thinking of her. I was going to say I'd write you and let you know how she was doing. But I won't do that, son. 'I know how you feel.' Ah, I wanna get back to Mobile. Better get going, I guess. Blue, Blue. Come on, Blue. Come on, Blue. 'Blue...Blue.' 'Blue.' 'Come on, Blue.' Lead her out to the truck, would you, son? Ain't I done enough, mister? Brung my dog in. Why I should be the one to take her out and send her away? You're right, you've done enough. You paid me fair. I'll take her out. Come on, Lady. I hope Lady don't cut up none. The boy's aching, I hope she don't make it no tougher on him. Things can get here so tough and no tougher. And Mr. Grover's aching too. I always heard Yankees are hard and uppity but he ain't, he'll do. He's alright, if you know him. Oh, some are hard and uppity and some ain't. That's the way Yankees are. They can't help it. I know myself a lotta mighty good Yankees. There ain't no use in overdoing it, Cash. There ain't no use in stretching it. Come on, Lady. [Lady whining] Lady, don't cry. Lady, don't cry. [Lady whining] [whining continues] Don't cry, Lady. Goodbye, my Lady. [whining continues] [whining continues] [slow music] They'll take good care of her, Skeeter. She's a very valuable dog. I reckon so. We'll be going back home whenever you're ready. I had myself a dog. You can always say you had yourself a dog. (Cash) 'Gates was in early this morning.' 'Me and him figured we might send ol' Mill out to your place' 'and let you look after him for me.' - I'll pay good. - I reckon not. We had us a dog. But I'll look after him, Uncle Jesse. Be good to have ol' Mill around. And I'll do all the work. I figured you didn't want another dog around. I like ol' Mill. He barks and everything, like I'm used to. Lady will be better off way up yonder. Yankees feed dogs meat every day. That's what the man told Uncle Jesse. Gates will bring him over in the morning if.. ...your Uncle Jesse don't mind. I don't mind. Whatever the boy wants. The man said it was a hundred dollars. That's what it is, a hundred dollars. How much 'em Roebuckers cost for Uncle Jesse? Good 'uns will ruin that hundred. There's cheaper ones but good 'uns come high. Now, wait a minute. We won't do that. You heard the boy. He told me to order 'em Roebuckers, it's his money. That's what I said, Uncle. Told him to order 'em Roebuckers. I don't want 'em that bad. Been talkin' about roastin' ears and hickory nuts and things like that but I didn't mean it. - I'm doin' alright. - I want the best ones. If it takes every cent of that $100 I want the best ones there is. You'll get good 'uns, I'll order 'em tonight. More than likely, there'll be enough left over for a downpayment on the 20-gauge. That's what I want.. ...if there's enough left over. Little old 20-gauge. Me and.. ...and ol' Mill hunting some birds. I figure you'll might like some coffee before you start back home. There's a nip in the air. I'd rightly like a cup of coffee. Drink mine black. Think about Claude. Drinks his black, too. Claude does. Black and stout. * When your boy becomes a man * * It's a sad * Glad thing *
