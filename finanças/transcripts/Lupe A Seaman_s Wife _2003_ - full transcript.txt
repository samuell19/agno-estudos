--== McEphie ==-- For latest releases visit moviesnipipay website This is a story about the lives of people, who dreamed of building their home away from everything. But near the sky... and the sea... Lupe... Lupe... Lupe... Lupe. Lupe, take a look at our house. It's almost finished. Hey, where are you going? If I catch you, you'll see. We need a better home. I don't like to end up like my family. Don't forget to write. See? That's what you get from playing in the sea. This is nothing, mother. Go and drink medicine so you won't get worse. You should have thought about that before. That's enough, Mother. I'm about to leave now, yet you're still scolding me. Just bear with my mom, okay? It's nothing. Here, Manolo. Wear this. What is this? Put it on your spouse. Manolo, you need protection from drowning and from the storm. - Do you know that... - Oh, Mom. in your line of work, you will need all the help from all the saints. Absolutely. It's better to be close with our Lord than with a druglord. You're really crazy. Take care of yourself. Don't forget to write. Squeeze it well. And increase the pressure. So that the juice flows. That's it. Go on. All you women should learn how to cook well, because it will serve as our only weapon. That's right! So that we can satisfy the men in our lives. Hear that? Look at Barang here, she doesn't know how to cook. She does not have a man in her life. Magda? What? Hey, who's the old maid here? Shh, Magda. Please. Right? Oh well. I'll just feed those men with the only delicacy I know. For sure, they'll keep coming back for more. - Your head is full of nonsense. - You're absolutely right! Hey, you stop it! You're teaching nonsense to the child. A ladle? They say that when a spoon falls on the floor, a woman is sure to arrive. How about this ladle? I'm sure a woman with a big pussy will arrive. Hi! I hope a priest blesses you, Barang! - How are all of you? - Come in, Cora. Shut up, stay there. Oh, Cora. Wow, rice cake! I'm going to miss that when I go to the USA Mommy Magda. Get Cora a plate. Dear, wait for my sweet dessert with coconut milk. You'll faint from its delicious taste. Oh, Mommy Magda! That is my favorite, you know that. I brought makeup. Wow, makeup! - I also have lipstick, powder and lotion. - Let me see. Here, take a look. Choose what you like. They're all great. Just a sec. Choose anything you want. - Hello. What? - Look, a cellphone Oh, what? When? Oh no! Next week? So soon! So is it okay? Confirmed? America, here I come! Wait, how are we going to get there? By ship or airplane? That sounds scary. Hey, Maria Clara. Of course, I'm excited. Okay. Let's talk tomorrow. Bye. Wow, your cellphone's nice. You might not need this anymore when you go to America. I will be even prettier when I have a cellphone. And even more if you buy the lipstick. Even if you buy a dozen cellphones and tie them around your neck, if you only finished your nursing course like Cora, you would even go to America, right? Mom, do you like anything? Oh yeah, right. I have a lot of stock. I need to sell them before I go to the US. Just let it go. I have soap, powder, everything you need is right there. - Go on, I'll give you a discount. - Here's your plate for the rice cake. Thank you. Let me serve you. Why is the ring on your right? Are you left-handed? Here, taste this. Please excuse me, Mother. What color is this? That's the color-stay lipstick. Daleng, come here. I'm sure you'll love that. Even if you spend the whole night kissing someone. That lipstick won't smear. Oh, dear! And who you think I'd kiss? I don't mean you. Of course I mean for us young ladies. But the color is really lovely. How about this one? That's an eyeshadow. You know, earth tones match your skin. - Like beige, brown... - Wait! Lupe, Lupe, you have a stain. Do you have your period? Here's your water. Thank you. She has her-- You notice everything. It's just a stain. I am a nurse, so I would know. Give me that. Darn it! My love, I'm keeping myself busy with work just to keep myself from thinking of you. Because I miss you. Please don't get mad, but I think you missed. I have my period now. Why does it seem that Cora wants me to keep it from your mom? I don't understand her. She knows everything. I find her mysterious. I don't really know what's going on with her mind. She wants to say a lot of things. What do you think I should do? Can I have a light please? Hey, what is that? Didn't I tell you that smoking is not allowed here? Celso just asked me to buy this, Ma'am Magda. Steve, please sell your items outside. - I brought snacks for everyone. - Have a snack! Can I buy this? - Celso, come eat. This is delicious. - Thank you, Ma'am Magda. Aw! Ouch! - What's wrong? - I think I stepped on a nail. What? How did that happen? Did you cut yourself? Ouch... it hurts. Let me see. Is it bleeding? I think I stepped on a nail. Shut up! Fool! I want the living room here. I don't think it's bleeding. Come and have some snacks. The kitchen will be there. Celso, come here and eat. I'll feed you. The room will be here. Celso, come with me. I'll show you something. I think there's something wrong. Come here. Let's go. Because I think there's a problem around here. I want our bed to be really big, because I want to make love to you there. Stop it... Put me down! Stop it! Hey, where are you? Come here. I've been talking and talking. Look at that hole! There, can you see it? Ma'am Magda, that's been repaired since last night. Oh, do it again. Repair it again. But Ma'am Magda, it's already fixed. Can you include this? Sure, anytime. Hey! Hey! Give me that. For Lupe Lopez. Let me see that. Lupe Lopez again? It's for you. I thought it was for me. Let's check if there's money inside. Oh, what is this? Mom, what's that? It s a flyer for a seminar for the wives of the seamen. Lupe, come and look at this. This is for you. That's important, okay? Do I really need to attend this seminar, Mother? Of course. Do you want me to have Daleng go with you? Oh mom, no need. She's a grown woman. She already knows where to go. But, fine. I'll go with her. So you can see different places as well. - Two tickets to Cubao please. - Nine hundred sixty only. Just one ticket. Why? Stop asking. And how are we-- Just ride the bus. Come on, get inside. And when you are back-- Daleng, wait. We'll meet again here. And we'll tell Mother that we went together. Go on. Wait, where will you go? That's none of your business. Daleng, how about your mother? I don't really care. I have something more important to go to. Daleng! Are you aware on how you can get infected by HIV and how you can get AIDS? There are three ways. Do you know what they are? If you have sexual intercourse without protection and your partner has HIV. If this is through your vagina. Second, is anal. But the most dangerous according to others is oral sex. What is the Tagalog word for it? Blowjob. The third way is when you are transmitted with blood infected with HIV. Condoms are the simplest and effective way for birth control and to avoid getting HIV. It comes in different sizes and flavors. There's chocolate, orange, and strawberry. Maybe one day, they will have more flavors like beef stew, pork stew, or even spicy beef. Yuck! That will really hurt! You can all do it. Because your husbands are lonely and far away, often times, all they see are the boats and the ocean. And when they come back, for sure they'd want to make love with you. But since AIDS is prevalent nowadays including STD, we should know how to protect ourselves. It's not only men who need to be cautious, but more so, the women. So, what do you think? What do the wives need when their husbands return from work? Anyone among you, girls? Dollars! I knew it! You really love money, don't you? What I mean is, condoms. So, here is what I am going to teach you. I have a condom here. Any volunteer among you guys? Me! Oh, it's Elmo. Okay, sure. You. But you will have to show your thing. I will put it in my mouth and nibble it. But in Saudi, where all the Arab's penises are big, the condoms that we will be needing are extra large! But what I will teach is how to use the condom without your husband knowing it. This can be done by using the mouth. First of all, you open the condom, while your husband is still kissing you. And then, you need to make sure that his penis is already erect, before putting the condom inside your mouth. There, it's like you're chewing a gum. And then, when you'll start to give him a blowjob. Yuck! There! It looks like it's wearing a helmet! Alright, this is my stop. He'll just take you home, okay? Take care of my friend please. But Nona... Okay. Nona, I don't think your friend trusts me. Don't worry. I'm her former boss. Go on. Take her home. He just looks stupid but he's kind. Go ahead. You can leave now. Now! Lupe! Lupe! You forgot your free samples of condoms! Never mind, I need these more than you do. You know what, Manolo often tells me stories about you. How did you meet my husband? Where else but on the ship. You're just putting me on. It's true when he said that you're even more beautiful in person. Why, where have you seen me? In pictures. Are all the seaman like that? Good flatterers? Do you think I'm just kidding around? Why did you stop here? I was wondering if you were hungry. There's a diner. And I also want to have a serious conversation with you. I can go home from here. Lupe. Lupe, wait. Stop! Lupe! What happened to you? Just a sec, keep still. What's this? Oh, it's my hair. It's in my mouth. But why is it curly? And why is your blouse inside out? Is it really? Yes, it is. Then I'll just turn it outside in! Come. Let's go to the restroom. Daleng, let's go. We'll be late for the mass. - Hey, come on. Hurry up! - Ouch! You're always acting lazy every time we hear the mass. Who's your master? You want to live here with me? I have no one to play with. Where's Lupe? - She's feeding the dog. - What dog? Call her! - Feeding the dog. - Hey Lupe, let's go. We're leaving. That dog might have a disease and we might get infected. What? Ma'am Magda, I forgot to bring my veil. Veil? Here, I brought our veils with me. What is that dog doing? What if it stays? I don't like it. It's bad luck. Temptation is man's twin. We cannot put an end to it. But we can avoid it. There is no right or wrong with temptation. It only becomes wrong depending on a person's reaction. Temptation is like a lost dog. Feed it once, and it will come back until it stays in your home. And you'll be the one who will be sent away. Temptation is everywhere. That's what I'm telling you. So stop it. But if your faith is strong, temptation will leave you. It is like a burning ember. If you always think of it, it will grow into a flame. It will burn you until you die in the flames of sin. That's why while it is still early, desist temptation from our minds. Don't give it a chance, at the onset, resist it. For it not to worsen any further until you've become its slave. Don't mind temptation because once you glance at it, it will seduce you with his seductive eyes. And without you realizing, it is slowly creeping into you. And later on, you'll start thinking about it. And slowly you'll become uneasy until finally you become weak. It is hard to resist temptation. Especially when you don't really know where it's hiding. You need to know, where it is coming from. And you must know what it is. The power of temptation only lies in a person's mind. Because naturally our minds are always busy. Yet the body is not yet harmed by temptation. The man can already taste the pleasure of temptation in his mind. Because a person's mind can do all things. There are different forms of pleasure. Like a flame that constantly burns, until you get parched and forget everything. Temptation is not the man's enemy, but only himself. How are you? This is Elmo, Manolo's friend from work. Your husband asked me to give you this for the house you are building. This is a lot. We need to have it exchanged while the dollar rate is high. Okay, I'll go ahead. Manolo asked me a favor. He wants me to give this to you personally. Are you still feeling sick? You've been like that since we were in Church. Elmo, come. Here's something I want to show you. Come here, Elmo. Come with me. My love, I really miss you. I'm going crazy as each day goes by without you. Especially now that I'll be staying longer because I'm up for promotion. Don't listen to whatever Cora tells you. Believe in me because I'm your husband. That's just how Cora is. My love, I'm all alone again. Just like before, I'm thinking of you now. I wish you were here. Your dirty brief, I haven't washed it yet. It is the only scent that reminds me you're still here with me. It is where I get my lust My little bit of happiness. And a bit of hope. And in every dab of it on my body, it's my only way to make me feel alive. That life goes on. I need to be patient and just wait. I need to do these things to go through this long, lonely night. I keep thinking if this is all worth it, That we have to be apart for the money. Lupe. You exchanged your dollars, right? Come on, let's go. Did Manolo send a lot? Only a bit. Why? Mother might be looking for me. Besides, I won't buy your lipstick. I don't plan on selling you lipstick. I just want to tell you something. Because you might regret it if I don't tell you this. Do love Manolo? Cora, what kind of question is that? It's important that I know the answer. How about you? Do you still love him? That's no longer important. We're talking about you because he married you. What did you finish? Nothing. Is that a big setback? Not having the right education is not a setback. What's wrong is your lack of judgement. Cora, I don't understand what you're saying. Lupe, the only difference between us is that my father is an American. But I'm a woman and so are you. We are not slaves, Or any man's playthings who follow their every wish. We are not weak. We are their equals. Cora... I love Manolo. And I know that he used to love me. But he wanted me to do something I did not want to. Now that he married you. That means, either he did not tell you or you agreed to do it. To where? You don't know your husband well. Here's my payment. Lupe, please take care. Cora, let's go! Mother Magda. It looks like you both are getting along well. We just chanced upon each other. Money? Poor Manolo. He's working so hard because of money. Yes, Ma'am Magda, what is this for? For you. Ma'am Magda, how about me? Shut up! I'm going to Akong to get the materials. Let's go! Cora, are you coming with us? No, please go ahead. Lupe, let's go! So, who hasn't been paid yet? We're all good. We all got our payments. Great! Hear that, Lupe? All are paid. Alright. Here, Celso. What is this for, Ma'am Magda? Come up here. Ride with us. Wait, why does he get extra and we don't? Because he carried me. Now go! Okay, let's go! Hey wait, your nuts are heavy! Just walk. Lupe, how about you? You can go ahead, Mother. Really? You're just excited to see your house finally finished. Don't stay too late here. Yes. The days may be sad here, but I get my joy from seeing our dream house being built slowly. There's just one thing that bothers me. Your friend. She said she knows you very well. But I don't trust her. She tells me a lot of things which seem wrong, especially that I am your wife now. Is she really your friend? We don't need a lot of money. I believe we'll be able to enjoy a better life even if you're here. Lupe... Lupe. Hello? Yes. They said she's here. But she's not. Let go of me. Let go of me! Is this what you're looking for? That's mine! Give it back to me! It's Manolo. Answer it. Answer it! Liar! Your husband wants to talk to you! Answer it. It's Manolo. Talk to him. Your husband wants to talk to you! You maniac! Let go of me. You're so beautiful. You're like the goddess of lust. You're an animal! You're a lovely flirt. He got you. You bastard! You taste good and because he loves you. Bastard! Let go of me. I've been dreaming about you for so long. Even though I was still in the sea. Don't stop. And his stories of you, I already knew that I had to taste you. I envy him a lot. I don't know how to tell all of this to you. At first, I didn't want him to. I fought with him. But when he kept going on. It's like, I feel... I didn't want him to stop. According to the book of Job 11 verse 4-6, "In His eyes you are perfect." I hope the Lord answers everything you ask So that you'll know that there is wisdom behind this and there are other things our mind cannot reach. I don't think I can forgive myself. God will forgive you. And when your conscience no longer bothers you, that means He has already forgiven you. What a flirt, she even trumped me. Lupe. Lupe. - Let go! - We will just talk. Elmo, let go of me. Come! Someone might see us What are you doing? - Please! - Let go of me! Stop it! Please come here, Lupe! Let me go! Elmo, please don't! Hey, Cora! Where are you going? Mom. I didn't know you wanted to see the Cimborio. You're like the visitor we had last Christmas. Oh, well... Magda! Magda, it's Tiayong... Good day, Magda. She will help us offer flowers for the mass. Oh Barang, you're already in my circle. Since you are known in this town. But I don't want to mingle with ordinary people. - Let's go. - Let go of me! This won't take long. Let go. Stop it! Where are you going? Come on. Mother Magda... Come. I'll go with you. Please just understand her, okay? Hey, Barang, just take care of that. Yes, yes. We'll just go see inside. That woman acts like she's so rich. She's just a poor woman. Oh stop it, we're infront of the church. She's too arrogant. Lord, please forgive me. You can't avoid me. Something happened between us already. And I know that you like it, too. No! That's not true! Don't deny it to yourself. We belong together. We're both hot and longing for someone to be with. Oh my, why is their railing like this? I don't know what they did with the old one. I wish they just retained the original. - Ouch, my knees hurt. - Are you okay? Not sure.This used to be made of wood. But what's more important is you were able to climb here before you leave for US. So you can brag about it. Up there, that's where we'll go. Enough already. You won't be a true resident of this town, Lupe. Unless you've reached the top. Don't. When you reach the top, you'll see the entire town. You'll feel like you're in the clouds. Come on, let's go up. Did you know that when I was still young, I only bring my closest friends here. Really? And Lupe? - Did you already bring her here? - No. Mother, my heels can't take it anymore. Let's stop. I'm a bit dizzy. I was just shy to tell you. Let's go down now. I was just embarrassed. I was, too. Let's go down now, Mother. Oh, too scared to go down. Let's stop. I don't want to do it anymore. Lupe. No. Please. I don't want to betray my husband anymore. Lupe! That Magdalena, she's so messy. Here, include these. Are you angry? I'm not. Give me those with detergent, so I can expose it under the sun. Lupe, why is there a hole in this panty? Mother, it must have been overused. Overused? But I just bought these. Look! Maybe the owner doesn't value it. Oh my, your pet! It's annoying already. Please make it stop. It might listen to you. Alright. Okay. Overused? How did that happen? Let's go! Aren't you going to stop? I'm going deaf with your constant barking! Here's your shirt. Let's go. Give it to me. So, where are we going? I said please stop! Come, let's leave for a while. - For a while? I don't like that. - I'm too sweaty. I want to us to do a lot of things. See? Am I not right? That's exactly what Father Dario said. That's because he's a stray dog. He is rude and has no manners. Don't mind her. Go away! Leave! You're not wanted here! Lupe, why are you taking it all on the dog? I thought you really love him. And how can I love that animal, when all he gives is trouble? Just chill. So, are you ready? Mother, we're leaving now. Don't go home late. If there's no good business, just go home. Please don't worry. I'm a gentleman. Lupe, don't get mad with the dog. He loves you so much. Daleng, wait. You good for nothing jerk! - What are you doing? - Go away! Daleng. Daleng. Daleng. Come here. What did he do to you? What did he do to you? Nothing. What do you mean? I don't believe you. Did he take advantage of you? No. What do you mean "no"? Did he kiss you? Did he kiss you here? Tell me. Here? Did he grab your breast? No. Did he touch you here? Here? This? I wish. Daleng, don't turn your back on me. What do you mean, "I wish"? No, I meant I wish I came home early so that you didn't get mad at me. What did you do to Daleng? Why is she crying? What you should ask is what I did not do to her. Here's my fare. I don't have a change for that. Anyone who could break this five hundred? Hey, who has change there? Huh? If you want you can just give it to me. - Ma'am Magda hasn't paid us yet. - Brother, here's her fare. What are you doing here? We need to talk. Lupe, Ma'am Magda wants to talk to you. I think she wants to tell you something. Do you want to come with me? What? Oh, Mother needs me. Come on! Who wants to borrow this 300 pesos? Me! Me! Me! I said I will. I will just get the change when I get back. What are you smirking about? That you tricked me? That you won again? You're such a fool. What else do you want? You. You're the one I want. I already made a decision. It will not happen again. Manolo knows about this. Liar! You're mudslinging him. It's true. My husband is not stupid. He loves me. And me? What do you think? I also love you. Okay, I will indulge. But after that you have to stay away from me. That's not the only thing I want from you. That's the only thing you want. Okay, stop anywhere, as long as there's cover. - Come on, stop anywhere. - Lupe, stop it! - Anywhere you want. - Lupe, let go of the steering wheel. Stop the jeep! Lupe, stop it! We'll crash! You jerk! Lupe! Lupe, enough! Lupe! Lupe, please. I love you. Elmo, let me go. I want you. But I don't like you. It's Cora. Cora! Cora! Cora! Lupe, I didn't mean to hurt you. Look at what you did. Cora saw us. I'm sure she'll tell everyone about us. Lupe, I didn't mean to. Lupe! Lupe! I didn't mean to. Lupe! Lupe! Lupe, I'm really sorry. Let's stop this! We are done! Lupe, don't say that. Lupe. Lupe! What did you just say, Cora? Are you telling me the truth? Wait here. Oh, here she is. Oh, Lupe. I've been waiting for you. Choose whatever makeup you want. I won't be able to bring these to the US. You know, there are a lot of stateside items there. Okay, Lupe? Wait, let me call Daleng. So she can choose as well. Lupe. Please take care of yourself. You don't know this family. Did you mention anything? If I will say something, I will only tell the person who can listen. If ever I saw something, I will only tell the person who can understand. What do you mean? You don't know your husband very well. Maybe until now, you still don't know why we broke up. Cora, come here quick! Cora! Cora! I'll write you. Just wait for my letter. Daleng's cabinet! Hurry, come here! Daleng, why did you do this to me? She just left one underwear. She eloped with Elmo. I know she ran away with him. Daleng, why did you leave me? Miss Lopez, a letter for you. Oh, this letter is for me. Is that it? Magda? Was that it? Magda? Help me please. Magda! Why, Magda? Tell me. Thank you, Father. Your every word is a sweet verse that runs through my flesh. When you thought Elmo and Daleng were together, you didn't get mad. But when you learned about her and Celso, you got really angry. That was before, Father. Do you have a relationship with Celso? Relationship? Do I? You'll help me Father, won't you? Magda, as the parish priest of this church, it's natural that I help everyone in need. Father, be true to your word. What I mean is through help and deep prayer. Bless me, Father. Whatever kind of evil spirit has possessed you now. I cast it in the name of the Lord! Oh my, Magda! Father? Where is Father? Father is busy, he's on his way to a funeral. That person's dead but I'm still alive. I need his blessing even more. Lupe, come here. Oh, Father! Magda. Bless you. I'll be back, I just have something to attend to. Lupe. Father, I prepared sweet dessert in coconut milk. I don't think I can accept that, Magda. The sauce is thick and the ingredients are complete. I'm sure you know that I will serve the Lord, even if I have to spend more. The bigger you give, the bigger you receive. I might not be able to give you what you want in return. Goodbye! Give back. You can give it to me, Mother. No! I've never been humiliated like this since I was young. Mother, the food. It might spill. Spill? Then let it! The food. Lupe. That's dirty. Here it is. It's delicious. Fresh from the kitchen! Yummy! Oh! Let's play some music. Play some music. Go on. There. That one. Hey! You're just a visitor here but you're too nosy. Oh Magda, I just said you have a big heart! You're insulting me. I don't like that. Let's celebrate. Let's celebrate! Cheers! Let's celebrate our being blind to love! You're so tall. Oh yes, he is tall isn't he? Can I take a peek? Wow, muscle! This is great! Oh my, we don't match well. Hey, wait! Hi, Lupe. Lupe, eat some peanuts. I'm not hungry. Don't just stand there. Take a seat, there's plenty of food. Is that the one in coconut milk? See! No one can resist my dessert, like this girl here. She totally embarrassed me. I already threw the food to the ground but she still ate it. Your dog is really annoying me. Make it stop. It always listens to you. Please make it stop barking. Go now! Here, taste this. It is really good. Hey, what's wrong? Be quiet. You want them to get mad at you? Lupe! You startled me, Barang. Why aren't you at the party? I have a date with my boyfriend. By the way, this is the letter that Cora left for you. Read it now before Magda sees it. The dog is really annoying. Okay, wait here. The dog is too noisy! Don't show it to her, okay? What's wrong with your dog, it's still barking. Hey, Barang. You almost missed the party. What's that? I'm just visiting Lupe. Hey, let me see that. Let me see. Give it to me. What's this? It is actually for me. Cora wrote it for me. Cora. Why would she write you? I am not sure. I have not read it yet. She said to wait for that letter. You whores! Traitors! Snakes! You're a snake, Barang! A snake! Wait a minute! Who's the snake between the two of us? Who's the bad person? Who? You're a bitch! Bitch! Stay away from here, bitch! Barang! And you! What, Barang? You son of a bitch. A whore! I fed you, you whore! You bitch! Leave now and bring that dog with you! Ma'am Magda, what happened? You're a nosy son of a bitch! Shit! You are the bad luck here Let's go inside. You're like a flea that suddenly appears. That sucks the blood of dogs. You are like your dog! Animal! You are even worse. You're worse than the tick that's already full but still won't stop sucking and sticking to whatever animal is there. You even deceived and slaved your son. That's why he left you. Get out! Pretending to be holy. Leave my house now! Snake! Ouch! So we can prevent rabies. It's a good thing that animal died already. It's almost cooked. Are you pregnant? Where are you headed? Why are we here? What is it? Just close your eyes. Tell me. Okay, get ready. Okay. It's beautiful. I'm not educated. I don't have anything to be proud of. I don't have a past. I don't have a family. I don't have a future. Why me? I love you, Lupe. I love you so much. I'm sorry I had to pawn my ring. That's the only way I can think of. Don't worry, I can get it back someday. I don't know where I'm going right now. But who cares? I've sinned against you so I should pay for it. Thank you for all your love and kindness. And for all my sins, I hope you forgive me. Goodbye. That's it. Have breakfast first. I am not hungry. - We have bananas here. - Okay. Just eat a banana please. I don't understand. You fooled for a while and now you're pregnant. I'm the one who's naughty and I have not been impregnated yet. Why did you give in so easily? I did not. He forced me. But why didn't you even use a condom? You kept all the sample condoms, right? Besides, there are no condoms in the sea. You really are stupid. So what are you going to do? You're pregnant. I need to talk to him. Don't worry. We will be able to talk to him. Elmo's file and information are here. His record is right here. He can't leave yet, it's still pending. Oh, is that so? Thank you. Is he still here? He wasn't allowed to board the ship. He hasn't submitted his health clearance renewal yet. Why? Is there a problem? It's SOP. Especially now, there are a lot of rules because of health reasons. Can I get his address? Lupe. Go away! I will not leave. What do you want? Why are you avoiding me? Isn't that what you wanted? Why are you coming back for me now? I'm pregnant. And it's not Manolo's. Why aren't you jumping for joy? Now I want to hear that you'll be with me whatever happens! Fine! Have the baby aborted! You're evil! You son of a bitch! Animal! Animal! Mother, please don't leave me here! Mom! I will just look for your father. He hasn't come back for so long! Ising, take care of Lupe! Don't worry, your mother will be back! I had that dream again. They all left me. Enough. Enough. Ma'am. The reason why they always leave you, is because you won't let go of your past. You have a lot of problems you have to face That I do not know how. Men are really like that. You think they're strong, brave, and tough. But you can't always depend on them. Are women always at the losing end? Lupe, now is the time to be a true woman. Don't let them step all over you. Hey, what are you staring at? Are you also looking for Elmo? He hasn't been here for months! Do you know how many whores like us he slept with? What are you still doing here? Go away! What happened to you, Lupe? I can't take this anymore, Nona. What if my husband comes back and learns that I'm pregnant? I'll go crazy. I'd die. It is your body, Lupe. If you want the child, it is your decision. If not, I know a clinic. Mission Hospital? Hello. There he is. Lupe. I know you'll hate me. You think that I just deceived you. I just did that because Manolo asked me to. But my feelings for you grew deeper. But now, I am like this. Even if it's painful, I had to go away. And this is also the reason why I didn't want the child. I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't even want this to happen. And it's too late that I've known only now. The Lord is asking me to pay for the sins I have committed. Lupe! Elmo. Forgive me. Miss, you're not allowed inside. Please stay outside. - Elmo... Elmo... - You're not allowed inside. Miss, please go outside. You're not allowed to stay here. Elmo! Elmo! Lupe... Elmo... Is it my fault? Because I taught you all this? Or is it your fault? Because it was your decision? I'm really confused, Nona. My life is a mess. Maybe it's best that you lost it. Because if he lived and born sick, abnormal, or disabled, he will just suffer. There is still hope, Lupe. There are a lot of things that can happen for you. It's hard to detect as of now. If you are positive or negative. The incubation period of AIDS varies. The best thing you can do for now is to take care of your body well. And we will monitor it with constant follow-up. Why didn't you tell me sooner? For what? To make you worried while at work? She's still my wife. What wife? What kind of wife is she? I don't care! She's still my wife! When you secretly wed and brought that woman home, you didn't hear anything from me. You didn't hear anything when I learned she almost killed herself before, because I know that she came from nowhere. She has no future. And has no right. Our marriage failed because of you! Do you think I interfered? I was even the last to know. If I didn't read that letter from Cora, I wouldn't even know about you! What did Lupe say? What did my wife say? Nothing. She wasn't able to read it. I burned it. Where are you going, Manolo? To hell. To look for my wife. Lupe. Lupe! You're back. Are you Nona's friend? Are you Manolo? Thank you for bringing me back to life. For you. Thank you. Wait, wait for me. Why? Where is it? Where are you going? Hold on. My love, we might lose it. You guys are still drinking? You'll just get sleepy! Nothing will happen if you get drunk! What are you doing? Here, here. You'll be needing this. Better safe than sorry. Then it will be hard for him to get an erection again. My jaw will hurt again. Here, you really need this! See, it's already limp. Come here! You keep on laughing. It's turning me off. Come! Ouch! Come here. What are you doing? Let me go! Ouch. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Where are you going? Let go of me! Let's go back there, come on! Lupe! Lupe! Let go of me! Let's go home! Let me go! Let's go home! Lupe! - Let me go! - Come here. Wear this. Come. Come on. I don't want to do this anymore. You chose your work over me. We now have a lot of money. Our house is almost done. But are lives are destroyed. Lupe... We can start all over again. I can't lose you. You are mine. Don't you understand? You are mine! You are in my heart. That woman can't stay here anymore. Mother, she's my wife. Wife? After she tricked you and got pregnant by someone else? You can still call her your wife? And you, woman! You even have the courage to come back! Mom! You fooled my son! You even had sex with his friend! Why? Is it because my son was not here? - What? - Mom! You can go and have sex with everyone? Am I right? She's a whore! I'm right, aren't I? Stop it! Stop it! Enough! You have no shame! Same with you! Manolo, we can't be together anymore. I don't want this mess! Where is the ring? Lupe! Lupe! Lupe! - Lupe! - Let go of me! Lupe, let's talk. No. You fooled me. You used me. Let me go. That's not true. Lupe! Lupe! Lupe! Lupe... Lupe... Lupe... My life is already ruined. Elmo and I are through. The baby is gone. I'm so ashamed of myself. Don't say that, Lupe. Elmo and I talked about it. You're evil! You both used me! No. No, Lupe. I want to have a family. I want to have a child. I want a baby but I can't. I'm impotent. I'm impotent, Lupe. That's why I asked him a favor. I asked Elmo to give you a child. But I will take care of the baby. And we will still be together. That will not happen anymore. Because Elmo got sick. He has AIDS! Did you know that he died? And I might have AIDS too! Now, tell me if we can still be together. Tell me that we can start all over. Tell me that you still love me and accept everything that has happened. Lupe. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. We can start all over again. We can have a new life. Just you and me. Why did you do this to me? I didn't know. We can still be together, right? We still can. I can't live without you, Lupe. You know that, right? When you fooled me. You lost me a long time ago. Lupe!
