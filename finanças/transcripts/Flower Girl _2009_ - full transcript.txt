So as soon as james finishes the titan case, We're gonna leave for our honeymoon. >> Oh, i can't believe i let you talk me into this. I didn't think we'd have to start so early. I was at a wedding till 3:00 in the morning. >> Oh, speaking of weddings, You're not gonna believe what happened. >> What? >> Wendy and kevin got engaged. >> When? >> Yesterday, apparently. I mean, he took her for this walk in the woods And proposed next to an old stone church. I mean, how cute is that? >> It's very cute, but i just can't help but think, I am now the only one in our graduating class Who's not married. >> What? >> Am i doing something wrong? >> I don't think you're doing anything wrong. I just think that you tend to pick these guys That are not looking to settle down. >> Okay, but i don't know that when i meet them. >> Well, there are always red flags. Like, you know a guy doesn't want to be serious If he doesn't have a real job. Or if he still lives at home with his parents. >> Okay, what's a real job? >> One that doesn't involve bartending, playing guitar, Or being a wedding photographer. >> That's funny. >> Look, you know a guy is ready for a commitment If he brings up subjects like marriage and children Or, you know, is honest and open about his day-To-Day activities And gives you jewelry. He will focus his entire attention on you. Period. No excuses. >> Rose's turn. >> Hi, honey. >> Hey, nana. >> Yeah, i'm here at the clinic, Delivering that get-Well bouquet. But i'll be back soon, So how's it going there? >> Uh, great. Just finishing up the chase-Kelly wedding. >> Fantastic. Uh, so how'd your date go last night? >> Nana, it wasn't a date. We just went for coffee. >> And? >> And, you know, he was nice, But there wasn't really any spark. >> Well, honey, now you've got to give him another chance Because he's a family man, he's solid, dependable, And he gives a lot of time doing volunteer charity work. >> Nana, he's a divorced car salesman, And he wouldn't even pay for my coffee. >> Oh. >> And, anyway, i told you. No more fix-Ups. They never work. >> You just gotta give it time, darling. I'm gonna find someone for you. >> No, you don't need to find anyone for me, okay? >> Bye-Bye, darling. >> Bye. >> A wheelchair at maternity check-In. >> These are for mrs. Sullivan. >> Those are beautiful. Syringa vulgaris, eustoma grandiflorum, And paeonia lactiflora. You know their latin names? >> I was a botany major before i went to med school. I'm dr. Cooper. >> Rose durham. It's a pleasure. >> For me too, rose. >> So--So tell me, doctor, How long have you and your wife Been living here in willow field? >> No, i'm not married. >> Well. Hmm. I tell you that he is the one. He's a doctor. He's charming. He knows all about flowers. And he wants to meet you. >> No, he doesn't want to meet me. He was just being polite. >> No, i showed him your picture, And he was not being polite. He thinks you're gorgeous. >> Stop trying to marry me off. >> But you are going to make such a beautiful bride. Your mother wod agree. >> I know you're trying to help, nana, but... >> i just don't want you to miss out on life's greatest joy. As the saying goes, "There's one happiness-- To love, and to be loved." >> Yes, but love isn't like buying a car Or getting an apartment. >> No, it's not like that. It's--It's like flower arranging. Sometimes you just know which flowers go together. Complement each other. >> Nana, i'm gonna meet someone. The best place to meet someone is at a wedding, And no one does more weddings than we do. >> Well. >> You have got to start prescreening guys Before you date them. Okay, when you first meet a guy, evaluate him for red flags, And if he has more than two, Don't go on the first date with him. You know, just nip it in the bud. >> In the bud? >> Yeah, that way, you're not wasting valuable time On a guy who doesn't even want To get married in the first place. >> What are you girls talking about? >> Uh, some article that brook read in a magazine. >> Doesn't sound very romantic to me. >> Exactly my point, evangeline. >> You girls. >> Okay, you just need to start thinking of dating As more like a job interview. Okay, and less like some sort-- >> Falling in love? >> No. I'm just saying, Try to meet someone who wants the same thing That you want, that's all. >> I don't even know what i want. >> You know exactly what you want. A big white beautiful wedding. With a cinderella dress and enough flowers To make the rose parade Look like our eighth grade graduation. >> I mean, i do so many weddings. I always thought i would just elope. >> You don't want to elope. You want to meet your prince charming, Get married, and, most importantly, You want me to be the maid of honor. You promised me. >> Of course. >> Brook, you look so amazing. >> Oh, thank you, tabitha. I know. >> You're welcome. >> You look incredible. Are you so excited? >> I am. I'm really excited. I mean, this is--This is like a dream come true. >> Mm-Hmm. >> I'm so happy. >> So, laurel, could you make my wedding Just as magical as this one? >> Absolutely. >> Oh, not just as magical. Come on. >> Okay, maybe just a little. >> Like 99%. >> Thank you. >> That would be great. >> That would be perfect. >> Okay, can i just see that ring one more time? >> Yes, please. >> 'Cause it is so fabulous. >> I mean, if you must. >> Wow. That's amazing. You must have been so surprised. >> Yeah, i was. I was starting to think i was going to get old by myself Waiting for my prince who wouldn't come, You know what i mean? >> James, you may now place the ring on brook's finger. Brook, you may now place the ring on james's finger. And i now pronounce you husband and wife. >> You know those saws they sell that have paintings on them? >> Mm-Hmm. >> A cabin in the woods, Bears by a river, that kind of thing? >> Mm-Hmm. >> That's what i do. >> Wow. >> Paint saws. >> Wow, that's so interesting. >> I love kids, which is a good thing 'Cause i've been crashing With my sister and her four kids for a while. Trying to save up for a new motorcycle. >> Awesome. >> Yeah, sure, being an investment banker is tough, But, you know, that's why i got the second home by the lake. Get away from all the stress. >> That sounds lovely. >> ? damn skippy, baby ♪ ? you make me feel ♪ >> okay. Are you guys ready for the bouquet toss? Okay. >> Congratulations. >> Oh. >> Sorry, she was just a little bit faster. I almost--I almost had it. So close. >> It will be a big morning, sweetie. >> Mm. >> So you didn't meet anybody at brook's wedding, huh? Well, you got lots more nice, young men in willow field. >> Okay, nana, maybe we could just talk about something else This morning, like current events or the weather. >> Oh, what about that doctor who wanted to meet you? Maybe you could give him a call. See if he wants to get together. >> I will meet someone when the time is right. >> Oh, the time is now. Maybe you could take a vacation to one of those island resorts With all those single men. >> Where people smell like coconut oil and desperation? No, thank you. >> The internet. I know at least Five happily married couples who met online. >> No. No way. Nana, this is not how the great loves met. Antony and cleopatra were not set up on a blind date, And romeo and juliet didn't go On some silly singles cruise together. No, they met each other and they knew, This is the person they were gonna spend The rest of their lives with. >> Sweetie, you are overlooking the fact That these are not real people. They're characters in a book. >> Well, maybe i read too many books. >> Maybe so. Maybe so. >> Yes, absolutely, we will have the flowers There by noon as promised. >> Okay, thank you. I'm so exited! >> Your wedding is gonna be fantastic. >> Thanks, laurel. >> Okay, we will see you on saturday. Bye-Bye. Good morning. How can i help you? >> By chance, do you have a grandmother named rose? >> Yes, i do. >> You're even more beautiful in person. By the way, i'm dr. Cooper. Evan. >> Laurel harverford. >> She promised me Her granddaughter would be calling me. >> I'm sorry about that. My grandma's a little obsessed with finding me a man. >> Well, maybe she has. >> I just knew you two would hit it off. I just knew it. >> He was lovely. You were right. >> The three favorite words in the english language Next to "i love you." >> Okay, nana, don't get too excited, though. He said he would call and that maybe we'd go for coffee. Besides, i need to focus on the wedding. >> Yeah, i got it. Thanks. >> Hey, man, we're all set. They have no idea. >> Great. Sarah needs you. >> Got it! >> Laurel, always making sure that everyone else's wedding Is unforgettably beautiful. >> Well, i love what i do. >> Maybe real happiness will come soon And you'll be standing right there Exchanging wedding vows with that special someone. >> Well, i have to find him first, pastor. >> Maybe he'll find you. >> So do you happen to know where the best man is? >> Mm-Hmm. Over there. >> Great. Thank you. Excuse me. Are you the best man? >> Which brings us to the question, How does a love story begin? Now in the case of the bride and groom, We have conflicting reports. According to him, it was love at first sight. He looked up, and there she was. The girl he knew he would marry. Naturally, she was seeing someone else. She didn't even remember sitting next to him at peter's barbecue, Even though he managed to somehow set himself on fire By passing too close to a tiki torch. >> Oh, no. >> It's the wedding toast. >> Oh. >> It's supposed to be funny, right, Or should i be more serious? >> No, i think you should start off funny And end on a serious note. >> That's exactly what i was thinking. >> So what happened to your friend? The one with the tiki torches? >> Oh, he was fine. I threw my margarita on him. You know, i think it would be funnier If it was a pina colada. >> Oh, pina colada. That's good. I should have you edit my next book. >> You're a writer? >> Yeah. You wouldn't have heard of me, though. Um, stephen banks. >> Laurel harverford. >> Pleasure. >> I got your boutonniere. >> Ah, yeah. You know, i'm terrible at those things. I always end up pricking my fingers. I don't suppose you could... >> sure. >> Thanks. >> You have a lovely town here. Lakes, the hills. Reminds me of the english countryside. >> You're not from here? >> No, no, i'm from cedar brook. >> Ah! >> Oh, no, are you okay? >> Yeah, yeah, i'm fine. I'll just finish here. >> So are you with stephanie or bill? >> Neither. >> I'm just the flower girl. >> Never say you're "just" anything. I mean, these aren't just flowers. They're works of art. >> Thanks. I better get back to work. It was great meeting you. >> You too. Maybe we can see each other later? >> Okay. >> Pretty girl. Should i be jealous? >> I don't know. Should you? >> You are impossible. >> She didn't even remember sitting next to him At peter's barbecue, Even though he managed to actually set himself on fire By passing too close to a tiki torch. Luckily, i threw my pina colada on him, he was fine. But seriously, bill, stephanie, You're gonna have a wonderful life together. Everybody, let's stand up, have a toast to the happy couple. To bill and stephanie. >> Yeah, bill! >> Yay, bill and stephanie! >> Okay, time for the bouquet toss! >> Go get it! >> Where am i? >> The honeymoon suite. I ordered champagne, or would you prefer a pina colada? >> Mm. Very funny. >> Seriously, though, are you okay? You hit your head. >> Mm. Yeah, i just--I didn't really eat very much today, So i think i have low blood sugar. >> Well, in that case, You're definitely gonna want one of these. >> Oh, no. >> No? >> Mm. >> You know, i've been looking For you all evening. >> You have? >> Please tell me you're okay. You're not gonna sue us, are you? >> Of course not. No, no. It was an accident. I'm so sorry that i'm in your room With your bouquet. >> Keep it. That bouquet was meant for you. >> Thanks. I'm gonna get back to work. >> Well, let me help you down the stairs. >> Oh, no, i'm fine. >> Are you sure? >> Yes, thank you. >> Please, laurel. Wait. The night is still young. May i have this dance? >> Right here? >> Well, the song will be over by the time we get To the actual dance floor, so why not? >> Oh, i'm not much of a dancer. >> It's okay. I can fake it pretty good. >> This is better than faking it. Where did you learn how to dance? >> Argentina. It's research for a book. >> ? capture a little thrill or three ♪ ? gonna let you be ♪ ? thoughts of you come fast dreaming of the past ♪ ? how long did it last till your blasted off into space ♪ ? you're happy having fun underneath the sun ♪ ? two becoming one... ♪ >> I should go. >> ? gettin' on the train ♪ >> Of course. >> It was really nice meeting you, laurel. >> You too. >> I hope we can see each other again. ? to capture a little thrill or three ♪ ? gonna let you be ♪ >> Hold on. >> I mean, it was amazing. It was amazing. We had this connection, you know? And the way he held me when we danced. I know this sounds crazy, But i think he could be the one. >> The one? But i thought you said that he was just in town For the wedding, right? >> So? >> Laurel, come on. I mean, he's just in town for the wedding. He's, what, some freelancer who doesn't even have a real job? How many red flags do you need? >> I know, but we really clicked. Doesn't that count for something? >> He didn't even ask for your phone number, right? >> Yeah, but he knows where i work. He can always just stop by. >> I-I don't think he's gonna do that. >> I mean, i finally have a romantic encounter With a guy, brook, and you're making it Like you're not happy for me. >> No, i'm just looking out for you. >> Hi. >> Thank you. >> No new messages. >> Here are your flowers. >> Thank you, laurel. >> Good morning. How can i help you? >> Are you laurel? >> I am. >> I'm kristen somerset. >> Kristen, of course. >> It's going to be a very big event, And flowers are an integral part of my vision. >> Absolutely. So what kind of wedding are you thinking? Um, elegant, evening? >> Big. Big and scottish. We're having a big highland wedding. Kilts, bagpipes, haggis, thistles, the works. >> So you're scottish? >> No, i just thought It would be cool to have a scottish wedding. But, you know, with some american-Style bells And whistles. >> Mm-Hmm. >> I brought my inspiration board with me. You know, to get things rolling. >> You have an inspiration board. >> Yes, this will give you a sense of what i want. You get the idea. I'll be wearing a cream gown with a 20-Foot train And a veil, so i'm going to need A very impressive bouquet. >> Mm-Hmm. >> Plus 14 bridesmaids bouquets, 7 flower girl baskets, a tossing bouquet, 15 boutonnieres, 36 table arrangements, 12 door pieces, A cake topper, and some potpourri for the bathrooms. >> Wow, you have really thought this out, kristen. >> I have been planning my wedding since i was five. Okay. I'll call you. I am off to the bahamas for a few days. I need to work on my tan. >> Of course. >> I feel really good about this. >> Me too. >> Later. >> Okay, bye. >> Thank you. >> Thank you for waiting. >> No problem. Uh, it's nice to see you. >> You too. >> Interesting customers you get here. >> Yeah. >> Was that what is known as a bridezilla? >> It was. Yes. They are extremely dangerous, And only to be handled by trained professionals. >> Do you have time To get that coffee we talked about? >> Yeah, sure. Let me just grab my purse. So my grandma tells me You know a lot about plants. >> I thought it would be interesting to study plants So that i could research And identify natural compounds that could be used in medicines. I mean, there are literally thousands of plants In remote parts of the world that have yet to be evaluated For their medicinal potential, Especially in the south american rainforest. And...am i talking too much? >> No, not at all. I think it's amazing that you know all of this. >> So how did you get into flowers? >> Uh, well, my grandma's been in the business For over 40 years, so i just kinda picked it up from her. Yeah, when i was little, That flower shop was pretty much the only place i wanted to be. It was like this magic place full of flowers and happiness. >> Sounds like you had a wonderful childhood. >> Mostly. My parents died when i was younger, So my grandmother raised me. >> Losing a parent is difficult at any age. So... tell me, what is it like, a day in the life of a florist? >> Busy. Most days i'm up at 5:00 When i go into the city to go to the flower markets. Then i come back to the shop, process the flowers, And set everything up, fluffing everything To make it look pretty. And then the phone starts ringing. And by 10:00, i'm normally on my fifth cup of coffee. >> I know what you mean. >> Now i'm talking too much. I'm sorry. >> No. No, not at all. You truly do look stunning tonight. >> Thank you. So did you always know you wanted to be a doctor? >> Yes. As soon as i could talk, I asked my parents for a toy doctor set. I wore one of my dad's old white shirts as a lab coat, And when we had company, I would go around testing everyone's reflexes And telling them to say, "ah." >> That's really cute. >> I even started taking pre-Med classes When i was still in high school. >> Wow, your mom must be really proud of you. >> Uh, you know, my mother always said That she would be proud of me, No matter what i wanted to do with my life. >> Wow, you two must be really close. >> Absolutely. Uh, and she can't wait to meet you. >> You told your mother about me? >> Sure. Talk to her almost every day. I couldn't exactly leave out the fact That i met a beautiful woman That i can't stop thinking about. Cheers. >> You were right. I mean, he's so intellectual and smart. And he really lets me know what he wants out of life. Really? >> Well, i mean, he's subtle about it, But he makes it clear that he wants a serious relationship, And he won't be wasting my time. >> Oh, i knew it. I knew it. He is definitely a keeper. I mean, do you think That he's someone that you could really be serious about? >> Yeah, i do. I mean, i've never met someone who's made me feel so secure And comfortable. He even told his mother about me. >> Oh, my goodness. He must really be smitten. Did you kiss? >> Nana! >> Well, did you? >> Yeah. But... you know when you first kiss someone And you have this flash-Forward fantasy Of how your lives are gonna be? You know, you could see your wedding And your honeymoon and two adorable babies? >> Yes. >> It didn't happen. >> Oh, well, honey, you know, Love isn't just like some magical force That overwhelms you. Sometimes it just takes time for you to realize That the right man for you is someone you never expected. Does that make sense to you, darling? Oh, gavin. Oh, how nice. >> Hello, rose. Hello, laurel. >> Hi, gavin. >> I figured it was time for a coffee break, So i brought you my light and sweet. >> Exactly. Thank you so much. >> Oh, you're welcome. I'm sorry, laurel. I could go get you one. >> No need, gavin. Let me grab your order. >> So how are your day lilies doing? As i call 'em, deer candy. >> They're just fine. I took your advice. I sprayed the whole thing with hot pepper and soap water. And so far, so good. The deer are gone, my hands are clean, My homemade guacamole's got an extra kick to it. Now if i could just do something About the birds in the blueberries, i'd be fine. >> The best thing to do is just pick 'em all and make a pie. >> Unfortunately, jessica was the pie maker in the family. >> Here you are, gavin. Should i just put it on your tab? >> Yes, thank you. Well. >> Thank you for the coffee. >> You're welcome. Well, i won't take up any more of your time. Good-Bye. >> Bye-Bye, gavin. >> Have a good day. >> Bye. >> That is such a sweet man. I can't believe that he still puts fresh roses On his wife's grave every week after all these years. >> He really is sweet. You know, we should find someone for him. >> Yeah, it's a shame that such a wonderful man is still single, But i really can't think of anybody That would be right for him. >> Looking for a book to read? >> Stephen. Hi. Uh, no, i'm just browsing. >> How about this one? Oh, handsome rogues, tempestuous heroines, Pulse-Pounding love scenes, This is pretty good stuff. >> Yeah, that's not really my thing. >> You don't like romance novels? >> Um, i just don't find them very believable. That's all. I like to stick to more serious fiction. What are you doing here anyway? >> Oh, i find the used book table is an excellent place To meet beautiful women. >> So i thought you were just in town for the wedding. >> Yeah, well, i needed a quiet place To get some writing done, So i figured i'd stick around for a little longer. >> What are you writing? >> Oh, no, no, i never talk about my work until i'm done. >> Why not? >> Writing's a very private process. >> Oh, i see. So you're still on page one? Maybe. I rented a house up here to finish my latest novel And it's actually just up the road here. I'd love to show you if you got the time. >> Okay. >> Here we are. >> You know, this is dr. Rubin's old estate. I used to play here with his grandchildren. Isn't it a little large for you? >> Well, it's always good to have room for guests. >> I remember this room. He has got a great book collection, doesn't he? >> Yeah, i was so glad he left it all. >> Jane austen, persuasion. Have you read it? >> I have, actually. >> What about rebecca? >> Now that is one of my all-Time favorites. You read this? >> No. What's it about? >> It's about a woman who falls in love with a man Who has a mysterious secret. >> I can't believe you've read So many books about women. I mean, most guys are just interested In spy novels and science fiction. >> They don't know what they're missing. I think women are far more interesting characters than men. I mean, men always do things for the obvious reasons-- Fame, money, power. But no one, not even tolstoy, the greatest writer ever, Could figure out why women do what they do. >> But that's easy. Love. >> Wow. Zantedeschia aethiopica. Gorgeous. >> Show-Off. >> I know. It's terrible. It's not every day i get to impress a girl With my command of latin. On a more poetic note, you look lovely. Please, come in. >> Thank you. >> You are welcome. White is fine? >> Yeah. Absolutely. This place is great. >> Oh, thank you. I designed it myself. Um, salmon's fine? >> Mm-Hmm. >> Atlantic. Fresh. I think we're fine. Um, i would love to show you something This way. >> Okay. >> Oh, wow. >> I thought you would appreciate it. My orchid collection. >> Stunning. >> Cambria tiger. Here you go. Try this. It's ouzo. You ever had ouzo? >> No, i've never had it. >> A friend of mine brought it back from greece for me. >> Oh. Hmm. Hmm. >> You don't like it? >> No, it's a little bit-- A little bit licorice-Y. >> I love it. >> Most people do. It's just i-I think i had a bad experience With black jelly beans when i was a little kid. >> Traumatized for life. >> Mm-Hmm. >> Serious medical condition. It is treatable, though, with a course of junior mints. I love spending time with you. I feel like we share something special. >> Yeah, so do i. >> So what kind of wedding are you gonna have? Who's the guy? How'd you meet? >> Well, believe it or not, we met at a wedding. Yes, my cousin had a destination wedding in bermuda, And he was one of the groom's college friends, And we just looked at each other, and we knew. I mean, i couldn't believe it. Has that ever happened to you? Where you just--You looked at someone, And you knew that it was the real thing? >> One sec. Um. Um, yeah, so let's see. You know what, actually, can i just-- Can you excuse me for a second? >> Sure. >> Okay, great. Thanks. Stephen. How are you? >> I'm well. Just thought i'd come by and say hi. >> Hi. >> And to give you this. >> Rebecca. >> Well, i figured it was kind of pointless Bringing you flowers. >> Yeah. Well, thank you. >> Listen, um, do you have time to go out for lunch? >> Oh, you know what, i'm a little busy right now. >> Oh, come on. You can take a couple hours off surely. It's a beautiful day. >> Give me one second. So, megan, let me see your inspiration board. >> Inspiration board, what's that? >> Wow. You take different pictures From wedding magazines, and you glue them Onto a poster board, so i could see your dream wedding. >> Oh, wow, i have never heard of that. >> I can't believe that. I mean, every bride seems to be doing it these days. Um, i tell you what, why don't you take Some bridal magazines home with you And make your inspiration board, And we'll meet back up in a couple weeks Or whenever you're done. >> Okay, great. Wow. This is gonna be fun. >> Yeah. It certainly is. >> I was more of a chess player. >> Let me guess. Research for a book? >> Exactly. >> Well, what do you write anyway? >> No, i finally get a day off. I don't want to talk about work. >> Oh, come on. Just tell me. >> All in good time. >> I thought we were going to lunch. >> We are. >> Aw. >> Champagne? >> A picnic. That's so romantic. Yup, i actually had to make a flower arrangement For a cow's neck. The whole wedding was black-And-White cow print. And, oh, they had cheesecake instead of normal cake. And for their favors, they had these little tiny cheese graters That said, "a grate love" on them. >> Oh. >> You get it? >> Yeah. >> But that was nothing compared To this biker wedding i did. Um, i had to coordinate the flowers With the bride's tattoos. And now i'm working on this wedding for this girl Who wants it to be scottish-Themed, But she's not scottish. Well, it sounds like you love what you do. >> Mm. Mm-Hmm. You know, it's funny. You're basically someone's best friend For a couple of months, you know, helping them plan The most important day of their lives. And then... they're gone. You move on to the next one. >> You ever thought about what you'll do for your own wedding? Come on, i know you have. >> Uh, i don't know. I-I guess if i ever get married, i would probably just... >> elope? >> Yes, how did you know? >> Oh, weddings are work for you. But packing a suitcase, running away to a distant land, That's romantic. >> Is that what you're going to do for your wedding? >> Absolutely. Well, if i get married. >> I mean, it sounds great in theory, But, um, i could never do that to rose. >> You two are pretty close, huh? >> Yeah, my parents died when i was pretty young, So her and my grandpa raised me. And then when grandpa died, it was just her and i. >> I'm sorry. That must have been very tough for you. >> No, i was pretty young, And rose gave me everything i needed. It wasn't till i got older that i started to realize What i was missing. Every time i see pictures of them, It just reminds me that they were real people That i'll never know. >> Is that what's in the locket? Pictures of your parents? >> Mm-Hmm. >> May i see? >> Sure. >> Wow. Um, how about dinner at my place some night? >> Um, okay. That would be great. >> Well, i'll call you. >> Okay. Oh, thank you so much for the book. >> You're welcome. >> And for the lovely time. >> It was fun. >> Yeah, it was. >> I'll see you soon. >> Okay, bye. >> That's fine. Thank you, sam. >> You're welcome. >> So you just ran off with him in the middle of the day? >> So? >> Well, what if something happened to you? >> What? Nana, we were going on a picnic, not skydiving. >> Does evan know you're running off with strange men? >> Evan and i have been on two dates. It's not like we're exclusive. >> Ah, honey, i don't want you to miss a chance To be with someone wonderful like evan Because of some struggling writer. >> He's not struggling. >> Well, he never tells you what he's working on. I think that is very suspicious, don't you? >> He will tell me when he's ready. Look, evan and i are still happening. It's just stephen and i have a connection. >> I just don't want you to be hurt. >> Nana, aren't you always telling me to hang out With other people? That's what i'm doing. >> Yes, but chances for real happiness Don't come by five times a day like the cross-Town bus. >> You sure about that? >> Now i just want you to give evan another chance. Oh, gavin. I didn't see you. Your flowers are ready. >> Thank you. >> How are you today? >> I'm good. >> Good. >> I am flying to buenos aires next week. I have a job interview there. >> Oh. For what? >> Working for a pharmaceutical company That's trying to discover And synthesize new plant compounds for medicinal use. >> I'm surprised you never mentioned this before. >> Well, i didn't want to jinx it. I mean, this is my dream job. >> So if you get this job, Does that mean you'll be moving to south america? >> For a couple years, yeah. But it would take a while to organize. I have to get visas and shots And working papers. All that. >> I want you to come with me. >> Oh, my-- Honey, do you know what this means? >> What? >> He's gonna ask you to marry him. >> No, he's not. >> Yes, yes, he is. Trust me. When a man sees the woman that he's gonna marry For the first time, he just knows. >> Really? >> Okay, what color Are you gonna have your bridesmaids wear? Because i just need you to know i don't look good in yellow. >> Okay, brook, stop. >> Any color is fine. Trust me, please. >> Stop, please, okay. I don't even know how i feel about this yet. >> Honey, a handsome doctor wants to marry you. And whisk you off for a life of adventure And romance, and you don't know how you feel about that? >> Okay, but don't forget, i also have a handsome writer Who's interested in spending time with me as well. >> Okay, well, you know what, you need to figure out If stephen is serious or not. Because evan is gonna close the deal as soon as he gets back. >> What am i supposed to do? Sit stephen down and ask him If he's ready for marriage and children? >> No, you don't have to do that. Just get him to start talking about his future. And see what he says. >> You look beautiful. >> Thank you. >> Did you know that in victorian times To bring someone red tulips Was a passionate declaration of love? The black center was supposed to represent A lover's heart burned to a coal by love's passion. >> They also mean fame. I thought you might like that. >> I'm not famous. >> Maybe some day. You know, i was lucky you didn't bring me yellow tulips. >> Why? >> Well, they mean to declare your love hopelessly And utterly, and to throw yourself at the mercy Of your lover. >> I could see how that'd be a little much for a tuesday night. >> A little bit. >> This is really good, by the way. >> Thanks. Wanna know the secret? >> Mm. >> I only cook with real butter. >> Well, where'd you learn how to cook like this? >> The cordon bleu in paris. >> Let me guess. Was it research for a book? >> That's right. >> Well, if writing doesn't work out, You could always be a chef. >> Oh, i could never stop writing. I love the freedom it gives me. You know, i can-- I can be anyone. I can pack up and just go anywhere for my research. I'm glad you finally had a free night so we could do this. >> Me too. >> You're a very busy lady, it seems. >> Well, you know, i have Lots of weddings and stuff like that. >> Hmm. I was beginning to think maybe i had a rival. >> And if you did? >> I'd have to challenge him to a duel. I'm a very jealous man. >> I can see. When do i get to read one of your books? >> Some day. >> You're a very mysterious man, you know that? >> Mysterious? Me? >> Yeah. >> Nah. >> Well, they say when a man is mysterious, It's because he's harboring a terrible secret. >> I think you've been reading too many books. >> Thank you. Have a good day. >> Thank you, laurel. >> Oh, very pretty. Oh, there you are. Where were you last night? We missed you at the book club meeting. >> Oh, that's right. It was tuesday. >> I made your favorite key lime bars. The ones with the toasted coconut on top. >> Well, i was actually having dinner with stephen. >> Stephen? >> Mm-Hmm. >> Oh, honey, what happened to evan? >> Nana, i told you. He had to go to south america. >> Oh, sweetheart. I know it's your life, But you're wasting your time with this stephen fella. I mean, he's not looking for anything serious. Has he even told you that he's not dating other women? >> Nana. >> Whereas evan has always been right up front with you About his intentions. You have to ask yourself, "What do i really want in a relationship?" Sit down, make a list, two columns. Maybe you could use different-Colored pens. Okay. Hello. >> Good morning, rose. >> Yeah, good morning. >> I want to get some flowers for nicky's teacher. >> I see. >> Can you suggest something? >> It was perfect. I mean, you know when you first kiss a guy, And you have, like, this flash-Forward fantasy About how your lives are gonna be together? And you can see your wedding day and your honeymoon And adorable little babies. >> I don't remember any of that. >> You didn't have that with james? >> Well, i mean, you know, James and i have been dating since i was in high school, So i'm kind of too far past That stage to really remember any of it. >> But when stephen kissed me, brook, it was like-- I felt like i could do it forever. And he's all into poetry and love. >> Well, okay, what about evan? >> I like evan. But stephen and i, we just have a connection. I just wish he was more honest about what he does all day. You know, he won't tell me anything. I don't know what he's writing, Where he's working. He says he's always moving around. >> Okay, well, that's a red flag. >> I know. I mean, i even looked him up on the internet. I couldn't find one thing about him. It's like he's an invisible man or something. So what do you think i should do? Who should i choose? >> Well, i think you should go for both. >> Both? >> Yes. Keep dating the charming, mysterious guy, But also date the doctor guy On the side just in case. It's perfect. >> I can't believe it. It's a total disaster. >> So she's gone on a few dates with this writer fellow. What's wrong with that? He's charming, handsome... >> my point exactly. She's gonna fall madly in love with him, He's gonna break up with her in a few months. Meanwhile, evan will have slipped through her fingers. >> Rose, it's her life. Let her live it. >> I can't help it. Laurel is a very sweet girl, But she is just too much of a dreamer. I'm afraid she's gonna miss out on life and love-- Real love, you know, with a man who cares about her. Oh, my gosh. There he is. >> Who? >> The man who is threatening to undermine my entire plan. >> Who's the lady? >> Who cares? She's not laurel. >> Come on, come on. >> What are you doing? >> I'm gonna take his picture with my phone. >> I thought you didn't know how to use that thing. >> I don't, i don't. >> It's you. >> Oh, drat. I have to get this picture. If i could just show laurel. >> Show her what? Some lousy cell phone picture? >> No, she has to see That this guy is playing the field. >> She's gonna have to make up her own mind about him. Let it go. >> I can't. Laurel's everything to me. She's my whole life. I lost my husband, my daughter, Everything. I have to protect her. >> From what? Life? >> I don't want her to end up all alone. No husband, no family. I can't let that happen. >> Hi, stephen. I'm rose durham, laurel's grandmother. >> Oh, hello. Oh, please, please, come on in. >> No, no, no, i'm gonna get right to the point. You seem like a very wonderful, charming man. >> That's always nice to hear. >> But you see that is part of the problem. I know you're seeing my granddaughter. >> Yes, but don't worry. I don't think it's serious yet. >> See, that--That's what i'm worried about. >> I don't know if i know what you mean. >> I know. It's odd. But, you see, i'm an old lady, I'm a widow, i've got my shop And my granddaughter. And all i want in this world Is for her to be happy. >> I think she is happy. >> Well, yes, she's happy right now, But what i mean is, Long-Term happiness. Settle down with a man who loves her, A man she can rely on. >> Does she know that you're here? >> No, of course not. No. No. Far be it for me to meddle in the affairs Of young people, but i think you should know That she already has a man like that in her life. >> She's seeing someone else? >> Yes. And they're quite serious. Practically engaged, if you must know. >> Thank you for letting me know. >> You're welcome. >> Okay, thanks a lot. >> Thank you. >> Rose's turn. >> Hi. >> Stephen, i thought that might be you. >> Hey, laurel. How are you? >> Um, i'm good. I was just finishing up with the harris wedding flowers, I'm gonna go home and change, And then i'll see you at the restaurant around 8:00. >> That's why i'm calling, actually. >> What do you mean? >> I don't think i can make it tonight. >> Oh. What's the matter? >> Nothing. I just got a lot of writing to do. I gotta hand this manuscript in next week, And i'm just too far behind. I probably wouldn't be much fun anyway. >> Are you sure you're okay? >> Absolutely. I just gotta lock myself in a room And work for a few days, you know. >> No, i understand. Good luck. >> Thanks. >> Bye. >> Hey, mom and dad. Why does love have to be so hard? How come i can't find someone easily like you guys did? You know, you just met and fell in love. You got married. It was just simple and straight-Forward. Why am i so confused? Gavin? Hi. >> Laurel, good to see you. What are you doing here? >> I was just bringing my parents some flowers. >> Oh. I was visiting jessica. >> How'd you two fall in love? >> It wasn't hard. I was fixed up on a blind date. I thought she was so beautiful And so intelligent. We were married a year later. >> So it was that easy, huh? >> No hesitation? >> Well, like so many young men, I didn't want to get married early. But that all changed when i fell in love. >> Would you ever remarry? >> Of course. I'd like very much to be remarried. >> Really? >> For me, there's only one real happiness-- To love and be loved. >> That's what rose always says. >> Would you like me to walk you home? >> Okay. >> Rose is a very wise woman. She's beautiful too. >> Hmm. You should tell her that sometime. I'm sure she would love to hear it. >> Perhaps i will. >> Hi there, laurel. >> So he still hasn't called you? >> Nope. It is the weirdest thing. I mean, we were having this wonderful time together, And then, poof, he's gone. Do you think i should call him? >> What? No. No, no, no, here's what we're gonna do. We are going to forget about this guy. I mean, we can't be focused on some guy That's gonna creep all out and disappear on you like that. >> I know, but what if it was a misunderstanding? >> Honey, when a guy doesn't call, It's because he's seeing somebody else Or doesn't want to hurt your feelings. >> Okay, so i shouldn't call him? >> Promise me you're not gonna call him. >> Okay, don't worry. I won't. >> Okay. >> I won't call him. >> Happy birthday. >> Nana, you did not have to bring me flowers. >> I didn't. They're from evan. >> Oh. >> He called me last night And told me to be sure to give you these First thing in the morning. "Dear laurel, "I want to be the first person "To wish you a happy birthday this year "And for many years to come. "No matter how far away i am, i want you to know "That i have never felt closer to anyone. See you soon. Love, evan." Wow. >> Oh, my gosh. Look at this wedding dress. With the little fishtail mermaid thing at the bottom. That would look absolutely perfect on you. Just because evan sent me flowers on my birthday, That does not mean we are going to start planning my wedding. >> Oh, come on, can you try to act a little bit excited About this whole thing? Just for me, please? >> No, i don't want to jinx it. >> You know what, i bet if stephen would have been The one who wanted to marry you, You would already have had the dress picked out And the flowers ordered by now. >> Well, if stephen and i were gonna get married, We would have probably just eloped. But he's actually not even talking to me. So it doesn't matter. >> He still hasn't called you? >> Nope. And don't worry, i haven't called him. >> Well, you know what, i'm sorry. I should have never even brought it up. You know? Especially on your birthday. >> No, it's okay. I mean, it's just--It bums me out that i'm never gonna know What happened between us. You know what, I gotta get out of here. I have to deliver those flowers And then go pick up some more ribbon For the scottish bridezilla wedding on saturday. You're still gonna help me, right? >> I'll be there. Oh, and don't forget. Tonight at the shop at 7:00. I can't believe i actually slipped and told you, But just try your best to act surprised. >> Don't worry. I'm on it. >> This looks so cute. >> You like it? >> Yeah. >> Why don't you wait here? I'll go get us a table. >> Okay. >> Be back in a sec. >> Hello, victoria darling speaking. Yes, oh, it's fabulous up here. Such a lovely little town. Oh, and stephen and i always have such a great time together. He is such a romantic guy. Makes everything easy. Yeah, well, when you've been together as long as we have, You just know it's gonna last forever. Okay. All right. Great. Bye-Bye. >> All: surprise! >> He's got a girlfriend. I should have known. >> How could you have known? >> The red flags. I just wish he wasn't so secretive About what he did all day. >> Well, whoever she is, she couldn't possibly be As wonderful as you are. >> Oh, she is, evangeline. She's sophisticated and beautiful. >> You're beautiful. >> And she has this glamorous name. Like she's from a soap opera or something. >> You know her name? Hmm. >> Well, there you go. You can google her. >> So who is she? >> Her name is victoria darling. I know. It's crazy, right? Like it's not even real. >> Oh, honey, i hate to be the one to tell you, But she's real. >> Yup, that's her. >> Wow. >> So she's a romance novelist? >> A best-Selling romance novelist. >> I thought she looked familiar. >> What, you saw her? >> Well, i thought i saw her... >> why do you guys have this anyway? >> We were reading it. >> The book club. >> Yeah, i read it when i was on vacation, And it's actually amazing. Sorry. >> "She had never seen a man like him before. "Proud, tall, handsome. "His dark profile thrilling against the evening sky. "This--This was a man she could fall in love with. A man she could never have." >> Ow, ow. >> Oh, what happened? What happened? >> Poked myself. >> Okay. What is the matter with you? You're just not yourself today. >> Thank you. It's victoria's book. >> You read the whole thing? >> Yes, i couldn't sleep. And, you know, i don't even like romance novels. But something about this one really spoke to me. I think it was that whole thing about true love And, even if it seems impossible, to still pursue it. >> But you have true love. Evan's love. >> Nana, i care about evan. I do, i do. But... >> but what? What? >> I don't know. The whole thing with him is just not sitting well with me. Maybe if i could just talk to stephen And see if we had some misunderstanding. >> Oh, sweetie, you know, i know you care about stephen, But he is not the guy for you. >> Then why can't i stop thinking That we're meant to be together? >> Life isn't a romance novel. I mean, sometimes you have to accept Even a love that's less than perfect That is pretty wonderful. >> I guess. I just can't believe he didn't even call me. Rose's turn. >> Hello, laurel. Is rose there? >> Yes, she is. It's gavin. >> Oh, gavin. So nice to hear from you. >> Are you free tonight? >> What? Oh, well, no, we're pretty busy. You know, that's the big scottish wedding weekend. >> A rain check? >> Well, all right. That would be nice. >> I'll see you soon. >> Yes. Oh, fine. Bye-Bye. >> Bye-Bye. >> I think i just got asked out on a date. Evan, you're back. >> I had to get back and see you. >> Did you get the job? >> I did. There's just one thing i need to sort out Before i accept it. >> What's that? >> Our future. Laurel, i know we haven't known each other very long, But i knew that i wanted you the moment we met. And you're all i could think of while i was away. >> Is this--Are you-- >> Yes. I am asking you to be my wife. You don't have to answer right away. I know that i'm kind of rushing this, And the last thing i wanna do is rush you, But... will you think it over? Of course i will. Hi. >> Sorry. Sorry, i'm late. >> That's okay. So... how was your date with gavin? >> Oh, well, you know, we just had coffee. And dessert. And then we went for a walk in his garden. It was just wonderful. Honey, he is such a special man. I can't believe that i went this long without noticing. I must have been blind. Oh, my goodness... is that what i think it is? >> Yup. Evan proposed. He came right from the airport. >> Oh, it's beautiful! Oh, i can't believe you're gonna get married. >> Nana. >> Aren't you excited? >> I haven't said yes yet. >> But you're going to, aren't you? >> I don't know. I thought evan was the one, but... >> but what? But what? What? >> Then i met stephen. >> Oh, i knew it. I knew you were gonna fall in love with that stephen. >> Well, we were just getting to know each other and... >> oh, that's nonsense. It only takes a minute to fall in love. I knew i was gonna marry your grandfather 16 seconds into our first date. It took him a little longer to realize He was gonna marry me. >> Stephen's made his choice. Now i need to make mine. Am i gonna marry evan Or wait for my true love, Who may never come? >> Oh. Oh, honey. >> You know, we don't have time to talk about this right now. We gotta get to kristen's wedding. Brook's meeting us there. And we gotta go. >> Honey. You're gonna be very angry with me about this, But i have something to tell you. >> What am i gonna be angry about, nana? >> I had a little conversation with stephen About you. >> Oh, nana. >> I told him that you were involved with someone else. It was a serious relationship. >> So you told stephen about evan? >> Oh, honey, i'm so sorry. I know i shouldn't have done it, But i thought it would help you to decide... >> no, do you think that's maybe why stephen disappeared? >> Maybe. >> Nana! >> Aren't you mad? >> Not now. I probably will be later. But in the meantime, i need to go see stephen. >> He enters the room and takes her in his arms, Kissing her with a warrior's passion. Drops his sword to the floor, and then it... >> you know what, why don't we take a break? We can get back to this later. >> Sure. >> Hello. Oh, those are beautiful flowers. >> Are you... >> victoria darling? Yes, yes, i am. >> Then these are for you. >> Oh, thank you. Hold on. I'll get you a tip. Here you go. >> Thanks. >> You're welcome. Okay. You know, we do have a deadline. We should probably get back to work. Is there something going on with you? >> It's strange. It's... suddenly i just can't stop thinking about laurel. >> The girl you were seeing? What's going on with that? >> Well, apparently, she's seeing someone else. >> Oh. >> Her grandmother told me it was pretty serious. >> Wait. Her grandmother said that? >> Yeah. >> Okay, you know how grandmothers are. They always want to set their granddaughter up With a lawyer or a doctor or, you know... at least that's how my grandmother was. >> I know. I know. I shoulda just called her, right--Gotten the whole story? I got wrapped up in finishing the book and... >> oh, honey, the book is important, But not as important as love. You know, sometimes i think You are just a little too sensitive. >> You're right. I mean, who cares if she's seeing someone else? I should just go to her and... >> and just tell her how you feel. >> Evan, hi, it's laurel. Um, when you get this message, Can you meet me at the flower shop? I've made my decision. >> I came as soon as i got your message. So? What did you decide? >> Evan, you are a wonderful guy, And i'd be so lucky to be married to you. But i don't want to stop you from realizing your dreams. >> You are part of my dreams. >> No, i'm not. I'm not. I mean, we barely even know each other. And i think we were Both just looking for someone. And that's why this was so rushed. >> I mean, i know we don't know each other that well, but... >> i'm really sorry. >> How many times did we go over this? And what color are these plates? I want dove white. That looks like linen white or something. I mean, How complicated is this? I don't really understand why this is... >> do not laugh at me. He's laughing at me. I do not want him serving at my wedding. >> Where have you been? >> Oh...evan and stephen. I don't even really want to talk about it. >> Are you okay, though? >> Yeah, i'm fine. Is everything okay here? >> Oh, you mean with bridezilla? She's on the rampage right now, i'm telling you. >> Oh, i was worried about that. >> Apparently, the ribbons on the ring bearer's pillow Doesn't match the ribbon on the garter belt. She's freaking out. >> Well, where's rose? >> Um...over there. >> What do you mean you ran out of caviar? I placed this order Six months ago. I'm going to need to speak to your manager immediately. >> Oh, where have you been? So what happened with stephen? >> I went to see him and... nana, he's in love with victoria. >> Oh. >> I don't want to talk about it, okay. We only have an hour, so let's get going. >> Oh, sweetheart. >> Come on. It's okay. >> Oh, sweetheart. >> We are not dancing to a dj. No, i asked for a band. Oh, my... >> is everything okay? >> Okay? It's... amazing. >> So you like it. >> I love it. It's beautiful. You are a genius. Oh, this is gonna be the most beautiful wedding ever. Just like i always dreamed of. Thank you. >> You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. I know i've been a pain, and i'm sorry. I just--I wanted this day to be perfect. And... now i know that it will be. I'm gonna go upstairs and finish getting ready, Fix my makeup. >> I will go get the bouquet. >> Okay, thank you. >> So what happened there? >> Well, i guess she realized it wasn't worth it To ruin her own wedding day. >> Isn't it funny how people can get so upset Over the silliest things? >> I know. >> So... when are you gonna tell me what happened with stephen? >> It's not gonna work out, nana. >> Oh, sweetie, i'm so sorry. >> Don't be. It's not your fault. But you need to promise me... no more meddling. >> I promise. >> I gave the ring back. Call me crazy, but i don't want to be married To someone just for the sake of being married. I want love. You know, passionate, crazy, romantic love. Just like in the novels. >> I know just what you mean, sweetheart. I do, i do. >> Yellow tulips. Declaration of hopeless love. Where did these come from? >> I thought they were for me. The flower girl is laurel. Why didn't you tell her about me? >> You know why. Our nondisclosure agreement. >> Well, forget about the agreement. You have to tell her the truth. >> I will. I will. Come on. We gotta get to the flower store. >> All right. >> Ah, she isn't here. There's nobody here. >> Well, where else could she be? >> It's saturday night. She's probably at a wedding. Come on. I think i know where. >> Okay. >> Come on. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I think i saw her van. Back up a bit. This is it. That's her van. >> Okay. >> I gotta hurry. >> What's the rush? >> It's not like she's the one getting married. >> I don't want her falling in love with someone else. Weddings are a great place to meet someone. >> Good point. Go ahead. I'll catch up with you. >> Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today To unite this man and this woman In holy matrimony. We are gathered here today before god, our families... ...our creator shares with us. Desires us to full experience... >> what are you doing here? >> You came by my house today To deliver flowers? >> Yes. I came by to see you. But you were otherwise engaged. >> You need to listen to me. It's not how it looks. I'm not engaged. I'm not seeing anyone. >> You're not? >> No. >> And she's not victoria darling. >> Yes, she is. I recognize her from the back of the books. >> No, she isn't. I'm victoria darling. >> What? >> Victoria darling is a pen name. It's a pseudonym. I've written all her books. Love's burning fire. The rose and the rogue. The wayward wench. Passion's darkest flower. It's all me. >> So you're a romance novelist. >> Yeah. I was just out of college, And i was working at a publishing company As an intern. My boss was looking for a ghost writer For a book idea she had. I mean, the next thing you know, the book's a best seller, And, bam, i got a career. But we figured that nobody would want to buy romance novels Written by some guy, so we invented victoria darling. >> Who is we? >> She's my publisher. Her real name is elsie guinness. We come up with the story ideas together, And i do the writing. >> And i do all the book gnings and the publicity. >> I don't believe you. >> I can prove it to you. He strode across the castle floor to her And held her in his arms. She struggled for a moment against him. He could feel her heart beating like a wild bird. She knew she should hate this man. A man who had taken her from everything she knew. But all she could feel for him... was a smoldering passion. And suddenly-- >> Okay. I believe you now. >> I now pronounce you man and wife. >> So despite what every daytime television talk show host Would have you believe about life in the 21st century, My fairy-Tale romance became reality. We didn't elope like both of us had planned, Although a wedding chapel ceremony In las vegas did have its appeal. Instead we got to share our wedding day With everyone we love. My like-A-Sister best friend brook Was my matron of honor. Evangeline, my very own fairy godmother, Made my wedding dress for me. Nana was accompanied by gavin at our wedding-- Her own white knight. The two of them finding happiness together Was the other true romance That played out on my wedding day. Oh, my loving nana. No matter how much i thought she shouldn't do anything more Than enjoy the day, She insisted on handling the flowers herself. Victoria darling-- Or should i say elsie-- Was there, of course taking notes. In an unsurprising case of life imitating art, Victoria started the next day On her very own modern-Day romance novel Based on the story of stephen and me. Just like cinderella, sleeping beauty, and snow white, Stephen and i found true love at last. I believe in love at first sight. I believe in matches made in heaven. I believe in happily ever after. >> I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. >> Hey! Hey! Congratulations! See ya. >> In the end, there's only one happiness, And that happiness is to love and be loved. If you follow your heart, Maybe you'll live your life happily every after too.
