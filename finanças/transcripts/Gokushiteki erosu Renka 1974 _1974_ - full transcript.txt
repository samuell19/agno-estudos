A Shisso Production Extreme Private Eros Love Song 1974 Directed by Kazuo Hara Produced by Sachiko Kobayashi Miyuki Takeda Born 1948 Miyuki Takeda Born 1948 I lived with Miyuki for three years. We had a child and many things happened. When our relationship reached a certain peak, she decided she wanted her own space. She took our baby and left me. But she still visited me once a week. So we had some kind of a relationship. One day, she told me she was going to Okinawa. I got really upset and agitated because... If she went to Okinawa... I would not be able to deal with feelings I still had for her. I felt I had to do something. So I decided to make a film. The only way to stay connected with her... was to make this film. I rolled a camera because... I wanted to see her. Miyuki lived with Sugako in Okinawa. Answer me. Have anything to say? Look at me. Say something. Why? You never say anything. You're always like this. I knew something was wrong. You never say what you want. I just got sick of it. Of what? You got sick of me? Can you explain? - You're always like this. - You can think whatever. Tell me why. That's all you can say? Why? What was the point of doing it? We never made any effort. No effort at all. You say you got sick of it, but you never told me why. You never want to say anything. So this is it, Sugako? What do you mean? So we're finished. It's over between us. You'd rather live with Tommy, right? You prefer Tommy to me. Right? - Not really. - Oh, yeah? Haven't heard that before. I'm glad. So it's the same. What? You still like me. I'm glad to hear it. You never explain anything. You keep changing your attitude everyday. It affects me. How can we give it all up like this? I'm not giving up yet. It's too easy to say we lost passion. We might as well have not done it. Please say something. So women need men? Having sex means a connection? I went to Okinawa two months after Miyuki left. She was living with Sugako. I went there and I stayed with them. For four or five days. I didn't know anything about their relationship. After a while, they began to fight. At first I didn't understand why they were fighting. But I figured out that my presence In their apartment... was the cause of their fight. That's how It started. The fact that I had a relationship with Miyuki made It worse... Because I was a man. That's why they were fighting. That's what I discovered. How? Why? Just tell me. Being with a man is normal? - I didn't say that. - Then what? So living with me is not normal? So what is normal and abnormal? I don't think like that. So what are you saying? I don't understand you. Say yes or no. I like this or I hate that. It's fun or not fun. Just say it. What is so strange? What are you talking about? I have my reasons. - That's all I have to say. - I don't understand. What about Tommy? What about this place? Don't whatever me. How can you act so indifferent? The angrier you get, the calmer I become. Smart ass. The next day Sugako left the house at night and went to Tommy's. But she came back since Tommy wasn't there. Sugako and Miyuki fought all night. We're living together and I care about you a lot. That's it. Isn't that enough? I want to be with you. It's not that simple for me. Everything is complicated for you. It's always the same. But I told you I wanted to give it a try... even if you think it's unnatural. You said you don't believe me when I told you how I feel. You didn't believe me. The same story here. Why don't you? I'm saying let's talk this over. But you don't talk. You don't take actions either. So it's always the same. You don't talk or say anything. What am I supposed to do? It's not that difficult. Even when I slap you, you don't say anything. I want to be with you. Miyuki, I won't go. I'm so happy. - I'm really happy. - You mean it? She slept with Tommy right here in this room. I slept over there and I couldn't sleep all night. The fact that they communicate physically... made me very jealous. Why can't we have sex? Maybe I should try. I mean have sex with her. Maybe you don't call it sex. With you, we had sex. That's what made it easy. A nice way to finish a fight. We kiss, have sex, and make up. It was too easy. Living with Sugako made me feel different. I just felt envious. Miyuki and Sugako soon separated. Miyuki and Sugako soon separated. Chichi A 14 year old girl from Okinawa Chichi is from Okinawa. I met her at a bar where Miyuki works. I don't know who the father is. My mother will be furious. She will kill me. She really will... if I had this baby. When I used to go to school... I never went to school, but... Anyway, when I went to school... I dyed my hair red and wore a short skirt. My teacher called me... And I told him... If I got really mad, I would kill him... Like I would really kill him. So he should go away. Everyone at school knew about me. The 8th grade. I don't go to school anymore. I'm not doing anything. I think I had too many fights. Sure, I would go back. But not to study. I never understood freedom. I prefer the feeling of fear. Everything is too easy when you have freedom. I finally realized this. Life is pointless without the adrenaline rush... when you fear something. Don't you think so? I'm going to raise my kid like a wild child. That's the only way. I will raise him to become someone who can survive on his own... no matter where he is and what happens. That's what I mean by 'wild child.' I'll go to Central Asia with my son... take things I need, and then get pregnant... I guess I should go right before the due date... and then have a baby by myself. I need courage to have a baby by myself. And I want you to film it. Like I promised you two years ago. I want you to see it. OK? I don't want my kid to grow up to be gentle and sweet. I want my child to be aggressive. That's how I want him to be. You haven't got it in you. He doesn't have the look. That's the way to grow up. Be sweet, gentle, and happy. My ass. Better not have one if that's how a child turns out to be. Don't you think so? Am I right? To Kazuo Hara Setagaya, Tokyo From Miyuki Takeda Goza, Okinawa Hello Hara I'm pregnant. Two months pregnant. The father is a guy from Okinawa. I'm having it. I'm having an Okinawa baby. I received another letter... saying she lives with a black man named Paul. I went to Okinawa for the second time. What? - What did he say? - You didn't understand? Just like you, he did it with a lot of women. - Did what? - Made love. Sex. People say women shine when they're with men. I think that was the case for me when I was with you. I was happy to be adored. I'd never had an experience like that. I was always rejected, so I was so happy to be accepted. But that wasn't enough for me. So I left you. I feel very insecure with Paul. That's because our relationship is unstable. I don't like soldiers. Being a soldier is not a stable job. Paul says he has money, but he wanted to be a soldier. My life with Paul can only survive in Okinawa. Being a soldier is not that great. It's not a great job at all. They come home and spend all their energy on sex. Some go to a whore house. That's where I come in. That's how I see it. I might be in love, but I know my role and my boundaries. I don't open myself up to anyone. I don't want to. What does that mean? I don't understand. You can always deceive someone. - What? - You're getting upset. I don't want to do this if you're getting upset. I'm trying to understand what you're saying. I'm explaining myself. But you make both of us upset. - You're confusing me. - So are you. So you love Paul, right? Because he is black? - That's part of it. - Why? The color shouldn't matter. What's being black got to do with it? - It should matter. - Why? That's not the only reason. I love him for who he is, too. But we have a different color of skin. Our baby won't have our complexion. I don't really care about that. I just want to be with him. I don't want any regrets. I can't live with myself... if I think I should have done this and that. Paul is who he is no matter what. I just want to give it a try and that's that. I want to live with him. Why are you crying? Her relationship with Paul lasted three weeks. Her relationship with Paul lasted three weeks. For the third time... I went back to Okinawa this time with Sachiko Kobayashi. Hara tells me that he's shooting this film... to understand his relationship with you. I don't mind that at all. I don't care about that. I just wanted to meet you and see who you are for myself. We had never met and... I was told that you don't like me very much. And I must say that I was intimidated by you. I didn't like that feeling, so I had to see you face to face. If he's not trustworthy, how can the film be any good? I don't trust him. He's good with words. That's why I don't trust him. He only talks about what he wants to talk about. That's why he doesn't tell you he loves you. He just wants to have sex. You were an easy target... for this guy. You like him. So what? I had enough of this. You're not the only one he had sex with, you know. He slept with many women and created messy situations. I couldn't work things out with him. But you can. That's why you're doing this. I just couldn't get along. I don't speak his language. He's good with words. And I don't trust them. He sounds like he makes sense, but he doesn't. He's deceiving. I don't like that. I don't like you two working together. How can you do it? You'll know what I mean when you leave him. You like him, so you won't understand. It's none of my business. That's all I can say. I've lived with this guy. I know what he's like. And you say you love him. But I don't really believe you. You and I are different. That's not the point. You're not doing this on your own. That's a mistake. Miyuki and her friends started a nursing home... for bar girls In Okinawa. All the kids there belonged to the bar girls. But In the end, It didn't really work out. Kenny was one of the kids Half black and half Japanese Miyuki has been thinking about adopting him. - I had a fight with that bitch! - That's great! I did! She said she hit her. Such a bitch. I scratched her here and my nails got broken. You scratched her? I tried to scratch her face, but her arms got in the way. A meal is not ready. I don't like this boy. Rice cooker is on. Once she got scared of me and took out an ice pick. Such a wimp. I told her to stab me. 'Wanna stab me here? Go ahead and try.' And she said 'do not make me angrier.' 'Call Mama-san' she said. She thinks I'm scared of Mama-san. Bitch. Bar Ginza - You don't own this place. - I don't want trouble here. We pity you. You will be alone for the rest of your life. I'm much better off than you. The boss laughs at you. He thinks you're a hysterical old hag. You get upset so easily. You won't be able to survive. There are women much worse than us. Get yourself a man. You need a good fuck. A hormonal balance is important. If you're smart and educated enough... you can arouse someone without talking dirty. So you think you're smart? Obviously not. I'm going to close up. Leave the bar open. They always make me upset. They make me so up set, I start shaking. I just can't get along with people like them. I'm not an aggressive person. I can only get along... with calm, understanding, gentle, and friendly people. That's all I want to say. It's not good for my mental health to deal with them. Just shut up and go home. I don't want to hear it. I let it all out and forget everything. Otherwise it never ends. You have been fighting since last night. Go upstairs. Drink some tea and continue fighting. I just don't want to hear it. She's getting old and becoming jealous. We have men, but she doesn't. She's jealous. Not to mention, my body is much better than hers. - You shouldn't say that. - It's true. I don't need a mirror to see who's prettier. I don't like her. She is Kaylie from Kumamoto. She got along with Miyuki well. I used to fight all the time. I had my own territory, but didn't know when I started. I knew nothing. One girl beat me up really bad. I could never forget. Bar girls today have it easy. I started when I was nineteen. Life was so tough back then. I had to clean up the bar twice the size of this one and... wash dirty panties, bloody ones. I was the last one to eat. There was nothing left to eat. I was hungry all the time. This soldier took a liking to me... and his girlfriend accused me of stealing him. I couldn't even speak English. How could I steal him? She made me shave my head. I was scared. That's why I don't like stealing men from other girls. That was the reason? I don't like it. I don't touch men with other girls. Girls steal men all the time, but I despise them. I got hurt so many times from fighting. I grabbed a knife once and my finger fell off. I picked it up and put it back on. I grabbed like this and cut my hand. I got stabbed here once. I didn't realize until the fight ended. I looked down and saw a knife sticking out. I poured sake. Forget the doctors. I just pulled it out. It was agony. It hurt so bad. Girls these days are wimps. Some cry when they drink. Some cry when men leave them. They have no guts. They fall in love much too easily. Then, they lose themselves. Sachiko Kobayashi also got pregnant. When I went back to Tokyo, I found out. I was three months pregnant. Did Hara say he was happy? - No. I don't know. - What did he say? - I don't remember. - I'm sure he said something. He asked me if I'm sure. He thought it was a false alarm again. So what does he think? - About what? - About the baby. He said I can do whatever I want and he will support me. He's definitely the father, right? I had mine because I wasn't sure who the father was. I don't like the idea of having a baby for one guy. I just don't like it. I don't care if he stays with me or not. I'm sure he's curious about the baby. He wants to see the baby. He is. He makes me mad. I want to kill him. - Why? - It's so disgusting. - I don't get it. - What don't you get? You're upset because I'm having his baby? That's part of it. I'm very possessive. That means his sperm got inside me, my kid, and you. All three of us have the same sperm inside us. That's right. But you told me I'm different. You admitted that. So what? That's why it's so awful. We all think we're special. Let him have as many different women as he wants. - He can split his soul three ways. - Three or four maybe? Don't be a smart ass. Why tell me now? Why didn't you tell me right away? Is it because of him? I know you only because I know him. That's why I'm asking. I don't care if you have the baby or not. Pissing me off. Looking for Kenny I'm Miyuki Takeda. - Are you from Okinawa? - No. From the mainland. - You looked after him? - Yes, I did. He stayed with me the longest. I think she works nights. Yes, I know. She sleeps during the day. I told her I could take care of him. Miyuki returned Kenny to his mother. But she was obsessed with this mixed child. She decided she wanted to take care of him. She looked everywhere. But she never found him. I wanted to tell her that I can take care of Kenny. It's not good for the child to go from one place to another. Two months ago? Two weeks ago. It's impossible. How can we find her? No way it would work. How long are you staying? Not long. Until October. I'll help you. Where else can we look? You'd better give up. Ten months have passed since Miyuki moved to Okinawa. I'm so sick of Okinawa. I really am. I can't stand the miso soup, tofu champuru, rice cakes... dried fish, and greasy tempura, and frozen meat. I'm sick of them all. Curiosity alone can't keep me here anymore. I'm craving for the mainland food. - You leaving? - Next month. - The beginning of next month. - I see. From a woman of the mainland To women of Okinawa Can you read this? My souvenir. - You work here? - You start today? I used to envy the shining eyes of Okinawan girls. I'm glad I don't anymore. See you. Don't fall for black guys with big cock. They will treat you like garbage. Just take their money and run. They even share girls among them. They will use you and lie to you. Don't ever have sympathy for them. They should all be castrated. Miyuki decided to leave Okinawa. When she made that decision, She wanted to express her feelings for Okinawa. So she wrote a pamphlet and... distributed them to the bar girls. We did It over two days. On the first day, we covered the area where she lived. Stop filming me. - What is this? - Just read it. You can read, right? On the second day, we went to BC Street. But the bar girls didn't react. We couldn't understand why. There was no reaction from them. So we decided to display them on the street, and distribute them, hoping and waiting for reactions. Then Instead of women, a few men showed up and started asking questions. Hara gets assaulted by gangsters. They said 'what can you possibly know about Okinawa? ' I said 'there's nothing wrong with expressing my opinion.' I really don't understand what the problem is. A huge crowd gathered around us. They tore pamphlets into pieces. A few more men showed up. They made a huge mess. They threw them away. How many do we have left? They said it wasn't the truth. I wrote nothing but the truth as I saw it. I'm serious about what I wrote. Is it because I'm from the mainland? You think all Okinawans think that? Eiko! If you see Eiko, ask her about Kenny. Maybe you won't see her. Sugako, will you come back by March? You will? I can see your belly. Take good care of your son. She's smoking a cigarette. Not many people here. Can you still see her? I've given up chasing It A city without wind or rain Flying aimlessly like the raven above Hara's apartment in Tokyo I'm not sure if it's starting. I should be ready. Maybe I should lie down. I'll lie down. Should I sit up? You think? My back hurts. It's not good to twist my back. The baby won't come out right. This is not good. Damn it. Is it out? Kobayashi-san! Kobayashi-san! My baby. My baby. It's crying. I'm so happy. Kobayashi-san! Kobayashi-san. I'm so glad. I was really nervous and scared. I was worried that something might go wrong. I was scared. She went Into labor after midnight. Then the baby was born In no time. It happened very fast. And I was so nervous. I was sweating so much... and didn't notice that the picture was out of focus. It's a girl. I'm so happy. The placenta. Give me a few minutes. I did it. I did it. Just a second. Are you alright? It's a girl. I have to deliver the placenta. Just a second. - What now? - The placenta. I have to. You OK? She's sneezing. Just a second. Not yet? I have to deliver it. Give me a second. I need to push. - Is it still connected? - It's not cut yet. - No, no. - What? I mean my vagina. I feel much better. Sneezing again. Blood is coming out. Just a second. I have to move her. You can leave the baby. - The placenta... - Can you do it? Yes, I think so. I have to. Still alive? Not yet? No placenta. You have to push again? I have to push and it will come out. - By itself? - Yes. - What about the baby? - She'll be alright. I have to give her some space. Blood will come out. I feel so much better. My baby. It's a girl. See my baby. Wait a second. I have to move her. Just a second. It's alright. Is she mixed? I don't know. Her hair is black. Just a second. Hold on. She is mixed. Don't you think? It was really great. It's good to be a mother. You want to take a bath? See my baby. She is mixed, but she is still my baby. I have another heavy load to carry. I'd better fix her eyes. It's very important. Without this, you may lose your eyes. Just a bit more. I'm glad you're not a boy. A lovely little girl. That man is not your dad. What shall I call you? I'd better think of a name. I have to think. Don't go to America. It's no good there. Japan is good. Japan is a good place. You're really worth all this. Mixed child is even better. It felt really good. It happened so fast. I should clean myself, too. She's got a big lip. - She's mixed, right? - It's obvious. Is it a she? Really a she? - What? - Nothing. My stomach hurts now. Mummy's belly is flat. The baby was inside. Don't do that. Hara-san! What are you doing? Babies don't need food for 24 hours after birth. You can breast feed the baby if you want after eight hours. I need some rest. I need to build up my strength. I need milk. It was an easy labor. I thought I could get Hara's sympathy... but I was too strong. I'm still tense too. You look really well. I made a mistake. I should have been more helpless. I could've gotten more sympathy. My mother told me I'm too tough. It's starting to hurt. You'd better lie down. This is good. It means my womb is shrinking. Miyuki names her "Yu". Miyuki names her "Yu". Hello, Mom? I just had a baby by myself. Dad? He left yesterday. Eight o'clock yesterday. It's a girl. She's mixed. What can I do? It happens. I don't know her weight. I had her all by myself. My son was watching me. He was quiet. I wanted to let you know. Can you hear her? Her skin is white now. She will get darker. I can't kill her now, so I will raise her. It's all right. I did it by myself. Now it's your turn. Sugako came back from Okinawa. Nice to meet you. - Everyone's looking. - Let them look. Your baby has gotten so big. Of course. Not walking yet, though. Aren't you cold, Rei? You're a tough kid. When I got back here, I was so cold. You're still a fast eater. He is too. He drinks and eats a lot. It's been four months since I saw you. - Is she asleep? - She is. So you had another child. I had her all by myself. - Where did you have the baby? - Hara's place in Tokyo. That tiny place. I cut off the cord and gave her a bath and everything. - By yourself? - Yes. I managed to do it. I called the health center about the placenta. A nurse came right away. She weighed my baby and took care of everything. All for free! She told me to go see a doctor just in case. And she introduced me to a cheap one. And I went to see the doctor. Should take advantage of the health center. Orange House A women's commune - Twenty seconds is not right. - You're right. We need a lot of hot water. Don't force yourself. You have to push when you think it's right. Don't push in the stomach. Understand? Push from your hips. That's a way to do it. - It's less painful now. - Really? It's done already? Don't tease me. - You will do alright. - I will do alright. OK. We're set for now. When it starts, keep boiling water. Yes. Bring it over here. Just keep boiling. It hurts. I can push right? It's not going down. Maybe a little. - I can see the hair. - Really? I think so. Maybe not. No? Trying to make me happy? Push! It's coming. More! From the hips! Don't scream. It's coming. I see the face. You can rest if you want. It's out! The baby is not crying. No? The heart's beating. He looks like Hara. He's not crying. He really looks like him. Is he alright? The eyes are opening. He's looking better. Water. When did he cry? Twelve twenty. It took a while. His eyes are big. Just like the father. Really big. Too big for a baby? People told me I have big eyes, too. A mother-child commune: Tokyo Komunu - I treat Yu differently than Rei. - How? She is prettier. - She's tough, too. - She looks after Paul. I know. Her mouth looks like mine. No. Looks like Paul's. - No way. - Seriously. Because she's always sucking. I'm looking after Sugako's kid only because I want to. Miyuki tried to adopt Funo, Sugako's child. It didn't matter whose child It was anymore. Funo, Rel, Yu and all the others... all lived In a commune called Tokyo Komunu. Kumunu was taken from the words birth and commune. - She's your favorite. - That's right. I like her a lot. Because she's tough? I like her character. She takes after me. I just like her. That's it. I just like her character. - And Rei? - I don't like him. I don't like his character. What character? I don't expect much from him. He really takes after you. Like father, like son. He's good with hands like you. Don't you think? He looks like you. Really. Rei is... well, he's introverted like you. I can just feel it. He's very tense inside. Just like you. - You're strange. - What? - Your nervousness. - You mean sensitivity. No. You're cunning. Knowing what you want in life is very important. Understand? You have to be sharp and trust your instincts... about what you need and what you want in life. The difference between knowing it and not having a clue... can have an enormous effect on your actions and your future. It makes you greedy and work hard. Sometimes it makes you crazy. I don't mind living with kids. I don't want to live with a man or a woman. Today, I'm with my kid. Tomorrow, with someone else. That's the best. Our society forces you to choose one thing. A stable family with one man. Taking care of your own kids. I can't stand that. I'm going to go dancing. Everyone, she's off to work. Say goodbye. You're all happy to see me go? Where's my boots?
