Mom, Dad, Josh hit me. Did not. Did too. Jack. I barely nudged her and only because she was in my room. It's been your room for all of two minutes. How about a little border neutrality, at least until we're officially moved in. Never mind that. We don't hit girls ever. Do we Jack? Apologize to your sister. I didn't hit her. I barely touched her. She's just being a baby. What did I say? Fine. Sorry, Gabby... that you're such a baby. Hey. You don't want anyone in your room, huh? Fine. Get your ass up there now and stay there until I tell you you can leave. Move it. Kent. What? Can I speak to you in the kitchen, please? Gabby, will you start taking the tape off some of these boxes for me while I talk to Daddy? OK. Thank you. What was that about? What? You're always telling me I'm too easy on him, and I should let him get away with talking back. Fine. I'm not happy about this. I mean, look at me. Here I am standing on this shitty linoleum in his ugly ass kitchen. So you want our kids to be homeless so you can maintain your spite. It's just that being here makes me feel like a failure... like he's laughing at me. Kent, turn on the news. We're hardly the only ones going through something like this. Baby, I don't think your father left you this house so he can laugh at you. I think he left it to you because even a mean drunk like him had to realize that you are the one worthwhile thing he did with his life. Hey, buddy, you all right? Yeah, sorry. I'm sorry I yelled. Moving kind of sucks, huh? Yeah. Well, school should be starting soon. Bet you're excited about that. Yeah, right. Oh, that's right. I forgot. You're my kid who doesn't love homework and book reports... the weird one. I'm not weird. Gabby's weird, probably because she's adopted. Hey, I don't ever want to hear you say something like that again, OK? She's your sister. She has been since she was a week old. She always will be. I didn't mean it like bad. OK, but it still wasn't nice. And you can't just go shoving her around either. I know. There is one good thing about moving here over spring break, though. Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What's that? We're here just in time to sign you up for baseball. Yeah, that's cool, but I was kind of thinking about playing a different sport. Really, what's that? Football! Oh, OK. Wait, no. Flag on the play. Unnecessary roughness. No way. That was a clean hit. Right. OK, buddy, save it for the field, all right? Your mom wants us to get cleaned up for dinner. Good. I'm starving. Kent, you want some tea? Yeah, sure. Tell me when. Oh. Thank you. Mm-hm. Elbows off the table, Jack. And napkins go in lap-kins, Gabs. Yeah, and be sure to put your pinkies up when you drink, kids. There is nothing wrong good manners. I never said there was. Earthquake. Everybody under the table. Go. Go now. It's OK, sweetie. It's OK. It'll be over soon. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on, Jack. There could be aftershocks. I thought there weren't supposed to be earthquakes in Texas. They happen everywhere. But they are pretty rare here. Not rare enough. Did you see that light? It looked like something exploded in our back yard. Well, it's probably a power transformer. It could have been miles away, though. Light travels fast. At the speed of light. That's right, sweetie. Hey, look what I found. You know there's nothing to be afraid of in the dark though, right? I know. You don't sound very convincing. Neither do you. I'm going to plug it in right over here, OK? How's that? Great. Uh-oh. What? I think I see a blanket monster right here. Oh my god. OK. There we go. That pillow could use some more fluffing. Goodnight, pumpkin. Good night, Daddy. Better your majesty? Much. Dork. How we doing in here? You don't need a night light too, do you? I'm not afraid of the dark. Cell phones? Got it. I'll go. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, you're OK. The lights just went out. A saw a monster. There's no such thing as monsters, sweetie. Here. I got something for you. Here you go. You all right now? I guess. OK, I'm going to go check that breaker. No, don't leave me. Oh, Gabby, come on. There's nothing to be afraid of, sweetie. OK, look. See? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing Nothing. It's all clear. OK. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. You think the kids are going to be OK? As soon as we get cable and internet, they won't even realize we moved. I'm being serious. You grew up in the same place. Mom and I moved around a lot after Dad left. It's not easy being the new kid. I think it will be a little bit of an adjustment for Gabby, but once school starts she'll be fine. Jack, on the other hand, could make friends on the moon. And tell you the truth... I'm more worried about you. I know what I said earlier, but I just needed to vent. I'll be fine. Actually, I'm looking forward to my new job. Working for the Brown Foundation may not pay that well, but at least I don't have to deal with anyone looking over my shoulder. It's kind of sad, though. Won't you miss being around people? No. Why do you think I went into research instead of medicine? So you have absolutely no interest in human contact. Good to know. What I didn't mean all human contact. Oh, so just checking if this would be OK. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. How about this? You look like you could use this more than I. Bless you. Dad there's a giant burnt-out hole back there. I told you something exploded. It's awesome. You've got to come see. Can I at least finish my coffee? But it's a giant. Hole OK. Hey, you two be careful. I don't want either one of you falling in. We will. Come on. Kent. We will. Scout's honor. Hey, hey, what did you just tell your mother? What do you think caused it? I don't know. But if I had to guess, I'd say it's probably an old well. An oil well? Could be, but more likely water. Earthquake probably let loose a pocket of natural gas, and then any little spark, like from rocks rubbing together... Whoosh. Yep. Giant fireball time. Cool. Will it do it again? Oh, no way. You saw all the gas burn up. And now that the hole is open, it would just dissipate into the air. How deep do you think it is? Want to find out? Whoa. What do you two idiots think you're doing? Get away from there. But Mom. Your mom's right. Back in the house. I'm going to cover this up, and I don't want you or your sister messing around back here. You hear me? Jack? Yeah, OK. I'll be the mommy, and you'll be the daddy. I know. But just for pretend. Look at this room. It's a pig's eye. Sty? What's a sty? Hey, Gabs. Who you talking to, sweetie? Grandpa. Oh, you playing telephone with Grandpa Edwards? No, I was playing house with Grandpa Peroni. Sweetie, you know Grandpa Peroni's dead, right? Mm-hm. And you know what that means? OK. Jeez, it's freezing in here. Wow. Hey, how about you come downstairs with me. We'll see if Daddy can fix the heat in here. OK. And you're wondering why Gabby's seeing monsters. Those are pretend. The one I saw was real. Gabby. There is something weird going on in her room with the heat. It's freezing in there. Pilot probably went out on the furnace. It's 50 years old like everything else here. I'll check it out. Hey. I was winning. Only because your mom distracted me. Don't worry. I'll be right back to kick your butt. In your dreams. In yours. In yours. In yours. In yours. In yours. Dammit. Hey, sweetie, you seen your mother? Mom, Dad's bleeding to death. What happened? I just tripped and scraped myself on an old garden tool. Do we have any hydrogen peroxide? Upstairs in the cabinet. Which cabinet? Just come with me. Geez, you really did a number on yourself, didn't you? Hey, kids, stay here, OK? If someone comes to the door... Don't answer it. Come and get you. That's right. Just don't get blood on your shirt. I can't get that out. There. All better. Now, you want me to kiss it like I do with the kids. No thanks, I know where that mouth has been. Hey, watch it, buddy. Hey, I wasn't complaining. Good job not getting blood on your shirt. Thank you. I'm going to head back down to the basement, check out the furnace. How cold did you say it was in there? Gabby's room. It was freezing just a minute ago. It feels fine in here now. Maybe even a little warm, actually. Furnace must have kicked back on on its own. What is it? Oh, nothing. Come on. Three! My pick of doom. You are never getting out. No fair! You guys. Pizza. Do you have any singles? I think so. All I have is a 20. Three do? Perfect. It's, uh, 19. $19.17. There you go. Thanks. Your coupons are on top of the boxes. I'll take those. Thank you. Careful. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good night. Mom, Dad, Gabby messed up the game. I did not. Then who did? If I say, you'll get mad. Not if it's the truth. Grandpa Peroni. Gabriella Meredith, you know we do not accept telling lies in this family. I'm not lying. Then obviously your eyes are playing tricks on you because you're tired and you need to go to bed. Now tell the truth. I did. Fine. Go upstairs. Brush your teeth. Get ready for bed. But... No buts. Go. Geez, it's freezing in here again. No, that's too hot now. Leave it. I don't want you catching a cold. Fine. Goodnight, sweetie. Night. You think that's funny? I am coming back in five minutes. If you are not still covered, we're going to have a real problem. Do you understand? Mm. Oh yeah. Hey, what are you doing? You know pepperoni makes you fart. No it doesn't. It makes you fart. He's old. Everything makes him fart. Hey. Not my fault. You know that's why they call old guys like me old farts. I can't help it. No, you could help it. Man, you totally let that guy get me on purpose. Gotta learn to watch your six. Can we restart? It's bedtime, anyway. Just one more shot at this level. Not tonight. I've got to go to work tomorrow, which means that while I'm gone you're the man of the house. I need you well-rested so you can protect your mom and your sister. Get moving soldier. All right. Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad! Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, what is it? There was someone in the bathroom. They were hiding in the tub. OK. I got this. Why don't you show me, OK? Aren't you going to get a weapon or something. I think we'll be all right. So what did this guy looked like? Big, red-eyed, and he was sticking his arms out, pushing at the shower curtain. But he kind of disappeared when I turned the lights on. He did? Let's take a look. I don't know what to tell you, buddy. Wait. Watch what happens when I turn out the lights. I swear I saw something. I believe you. It's all right. I'm not crazy. I know what I saw. Sometimes when our brain can't process something, it just sort of makes stuff up. With the stress of the move and the earthquake last night and that weird hole in the back yard, it was just searching for a solution. And for you, it's a red-eyed monster in the bathtub. That doesn't make you crazy. It just makes you human. We all just need to get a good night's sleep. Everything will be back to normal tomorrow. I promise. OK? OK. Hold on. There is something very wrong in this room. Pepperoni. Oh, you. Now get some sleep before you wake up your sister. I hope the paint doesn't peel off these walls. Man. Everything OK? Yeah. A new place, lots going on. Kids are just getting spooked. It's nothing I couldn't have predicted. I'm a little worried about Gabby, though. She seemed to really believe what she was saying about your father. She's just acting out. Yeah, I'm sure you're right. Well, I think I'm going to head on to bed. OK. All right if I finish this chapter? Sure. See you in a few. Mm-hm. Jack, what are you doing out of bed? Jack? Jack. God, Jack, that is not funny. What's not funny? I came because you called my name. What's going on in here? I saw someone in the hallway, and I thought they came in here, but then they just disappeared. Great. You're seeing things too. Look, I know what I saw. Honey, I'm sure you think you saw something. Stay with the kids. Kent. Don't even think of coming back. I have a gun, and it's loaded. You sure they didn't steal nothing? Just busted up some stuff? As far as we can tell. Well, I'll go ahead and take a report, in case y'all notice anything missing in the morning. Not much else I can do. Who would do something like this? It could have been anybody... drunken teenagers, druggies. My most likely suspect would be Mexicans. Lots of times, they get dropped off just across the border without nothing, ending up busting into folks' homes looking for food or something they can pawn to make their way north. If was y'all, living all the way out here, I'd invest in some better locks, possibly even get y'all a firearm. No. We have children, we're not having guns in this house. Suit yourself, ma'am. Thanks a lot, Sheriff. No problemo. OK, excitement's over. You two need to get to bed. You really should get a gun dad, like an AR-15, or at least a Smith &amp; Wesson 500. He is not getting a gun. Go. Both of you. I'll stop by the hardware store tomorrow and get some deadbolts on the way home from work. Could we get a dog. No dogs. Bed, sleep, now... don't make me say it again. That worked. You seen my dress socks? They should be in the drawer with your underwear. I might have put them in the back though, why? No reason. You look like a nerd. I wish he was more like a nerd. Nerds are the ones that hire the guys that picked on them when they were younger. Good point. Never mind, then. You might want to think about that, wise guy. Doubtful. Well, I'm off. Don't give your mother any more grief than usual while I'm at work. Talk about doubtful. Bye. Here. You can pitch for me. No, you can pitch for me. But you can never hit the ball. I can too. You just don't throw it right. Fine. I'll give you five tries. But if you miss them all, you gotta pitch for me. OK. Remember... you miss them all, you got to pitch for me. What if I hit five home runs. Shh. No fair. That doesn't count. I wasn't ready. You were in the batter's box. I'm not playing if you're going to be mean. Fine. Five more tries starting now. Learn to throw. Don't need to. Ready? Yeah. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. Jack? What happened? It wasn't me. Gabby was holding the bat. It just slipped out of my hands. You both need to be more careful. Come on. I need you both to help me unpack some boxes anyways. Let's go. Why do I have to unpack boxes? She did it. Jack. Whatever. Ugh. Mr. Navarro, right? Call me Hector. OK, what can I do for you, Hector? Dr. Layton wants what you have so far. Sure. Here you go. Give him that. And tell him I'm about 2/3 through the samples, and there's an anomaly on 134. Little advice? Sure. Just give him what he asks for. Leave him alone. I've been hiding for the last two minutes and you never found me. That's because I wasn't playing, dummy. I told you that. Only because you know you'd lose. Yeah, right. I find you in less than a minute always. That's why I'm not playing, because it's no fun. Jack, come here, please. See what you did? Me? You're the one who's yelling. Don't mess with my game. Yeah? I told you I'm working on my grant proposal. Is it too much to ask for five minutes without you and your sister trying to kill each other? But she was the one bugging me. Did I ask you that? You're the older brother, Jack. I expect more out of you. Now, please, I just need 30 minutes. Can you give me that. Fine. I'll be quiet. Promise. Good. Thank you. Oh, she is so dead. Hi. Hi from Jack. Now, please. Aha! Gabby? If you're up here, come out. I won't be mad about you taking my controller. I promise. Mom? I'm sorry, but I can't find Gabby. We were fighting because she wanted me to play hide and go seek, but I wouldn't. So I think she took my controllers so that I'd play. But now I can't find her. She's never this good at hiding. She's probably just scared of what you'll do if you do find her. Yeah, but I told her she could come out, and I wouldn't be mad. Maybe she didn't hear you. Maybe but I looked everywhere. What if that guy who broke in last night came back? I doubt it, but come on. Let's go find your sister. What are you doing here? Shh. It's back. The monster? You're not supposed to be here. All I bring is pain. Gabby, this is your mother. Game's over. Time to come out, OK? Gabby? Can you hear me? Come on. No more hiding. Did you do that? Do what? Close the cabinets. No. Swear. Gabby? Gabby! Gabriella Meredith, if you did not come right now, you're going to be in big trouble. Do you hear me? Gabby, what are you doing? Get down from there. Didn't you hear me calling you? And how in the world did you get up here? What is wrong with you? I was hiding from the monster. There are no such things as monsters, Gabby. Baby, what's the matter? Go. Go, go, go, go! What was that, Mommy? What was that? I'm scared. What did you see? Dad! Daddy. Hey, what's going on? Daddy. What's all the screaming? I saw something. There's something upstairs. Something? What kind of something? An animal? I don't... I don't know what it was, a ghost, a demon, but I've never seen something like it before. We need to get the hell out of this house right now. Steph, calm down. You didn't see it. We did. All of you? Mm-hm. Jack? Well, Gabby peed herself and Mom looked really scared, and I did see all the cabinet doors upstairs close on their own. Like, what might happen with weak hinges in an old drafty house? Kent, this had nothing to do with old hinges. I saw something in the hallway mirror upstairs, and then it was gone. OK, up here, right? Kent, don't. Look, there's nothing up here. It's like I told Jack. I believe you saw something, but it's just not a monster, because they don't exist. I'm not saying it was a monster, but whatever it was a human, and I don't want to see it again. Steph, be reasonable. What's more likely... that something passed by outside and put a weird reflection in the mirror and Gabby's power of suggestion just made your mind turn it into something, or we have demons from hell hanging out in the hallway? It's just the door. I'll get it. Why don't you go in the kitchen and pour yourself a glass of wine? I don't need a glass of wine. I need to get out of this house. Honey, come on. You're scaring the kids. Maybe they should be scared. I'll tell you what. Have that glass of wine. If you still want to leave after you've had a chance to relax and reflect, we will. Sweetie we're going to get you cleaned up, and then we're going to get out of here, OK? Good. Hi. Hey, sorry to bug you, but I couldn't get you on your cell. Yeah, the reception's kind of hit and miss out here. Well, Layton's freaking out. Thinks whatever you found today could be big. He said that? No, no, man, he said, it's nothing. It's nothing about 1,000 times, which is how he does before he ends up publishing some big paper or whatever. Hmm, so what does he want me to do? I mean, I've already given my findings, and I called the lab to request a duplicate sample. Yeah, he was hoping you'd call the lab and put a rush on the duplicate. They're not really big fans of his over there. He tends to rub some people the wrong way. But if it was the new guy asking, they might cut you a break. Well, they'll be closed by now, but I can do it first thing in the morning. Cool. Just as soon as possible, or the dude will drive me crazy, which then I'll have to pass along to you, which will suck. Who's this? This is my wife Stephanie and our kids, Jack and Gabby. Hey, guys. I'm Hector. I work with your dad. That's nice, but we're just leaving. So if you could. Steph, seriously? Yes, seriously. I'm not having my children stay one more night in this house. You're being ridiculous. Fine, but me and the kids are going to be it somewhere else. Could I just talk to you alone in the kitchen for a moment, please? One minute? Sure. You guys all right? Yeah. Yeah. What's going on? Steph, I know you're scared, which is why I'm willing to make a deal with you. If you go out there right now and tell the kids that what you saw was just a reflection of a passing truck and there's nothing to be afraid of, then the next even minutely strange thing that happens in this house, we'll leave... all of us. You swear? I don't know where we'll go, but yeah, I swear. Look, there is always a reasonable scientific explanation for everything. And now that I'm here, I'll be able to see what you're seeing and help you understand what it really is. I Hope you're right. But just in case, I'm going to put an overnight bag in the car. OK, fine. And that's when I peed myself. I think you should talk to my granny. She could help you. We don't need any help. Gabby and I just saw a reflection of a monster off one of those energy drink trucks, and I let my imagination get the best of me. We'll be fine. Are you sure? I've been through it myself. When I moved in my first apartment, things moved around on their own. And every morning, my oven door was open, even after I'd bungee corded it. So I called my granny, and after she came over, all of it stopped. We're kind of broke at the moment. We don't really have money to be paying for psychics and witchdoctors. Well, she's not any of those. And she doesn't take money. I mean, sometimes people give it to her, but... I'm sure they do. We'll be fine on our own, though. See you at work tomorrow. If that's what you want. Why can't we go back to Portland? Because we live here now. What about the monster? There is no such thing as monsters, and that's the last I want to hear of that from any of you. You are all scaring yourselves to death for no reason, and it has to stop. You hear me? Yes, Daddy. Jack? Yeah. Good. Now eat your dinner. You going to give me the silent treatment all night? Take that as a yes. Look, I was just doing what I thought was right. Do you really want the kids growing up seeing boogeymen behind every curtain? But if they do, I don't want them to be afraid to tell us. I can't explain to you what I saw. If you had seen it, you would understand. There's something very wrong in this house. What are you saying, that my dad is haunting us? I don't know. I don't know if it's your dad or something else. All I know is that... Kent, I'm not crazy. I saw something. Jack. Jack. What is it, Gabby? Can I sleep with you tonight? Why? The monster's back in my room. Dad said that there are no monsters and you and Mom just made that up with your imaginations. Now go back to bed. Leave me alone. I'm tired. Jack, look. You should show Mom and Dad. Dad would just yell at me again and say I'm lying. But you're not, are you? Jack? What the hell? Dad! Dad! I thought I put a stop to this. Help! Open this damn door right now. Dad, help. Steph, wake up. Wake up. Mom, are you OK? Yeah. I'm OK. I'm OK, sweetie. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just go back to sleep. It's going to be OK. Everything's going to be OK now. Is it? What are you doing? What are you doing? You're not leaving us, are you? No, honey. I'll be right outside. I'm just going to check on your mom, OK? Stay here. Don't let anyone in but me or your mother, OK? OK. You OK? No. You? I gotta get to work soon. That's what you're worried about? No. I just... I don't think it's a good idea for me to lose our only source of income right now. I was crossing my fingers hoping our card would go through when I paid for the room last night. 'K. If you're going in to work, you need to ask that... the guy from last night... what's his name? Hector? Yes. You need to tell him we need his grandmother's help. Oh, come on, Steph. She's probably just some sort kook. And Hector... he was in jail at one point, OK? You left him alone with our children? Well, it was just for stealing a car when he was a teenager. I mean, he seems like a nice enough guy, I guess, but... But what? You think you know better? What is your reasonable, scientific explanation for what happened last night? I don't have one, OK? I always thought that people who believed in ghosts were like people who believed in Bigfoot or fairies. Well, I guess you were wrong, probably because you don't know everything. I never said I did. You sure act like you do. First you don't believe me, and now you want to turn down help. Why? Because you don't think it's possible that someone else could be more in tune with what we're dealing with than you. No, if you want me to ask, I will. Good. OK. All I was trying to say is I think we need to be very careful with what little bit of money we have left and not get our hopes up. Hey. Hi. I need to pick up your work. Yeah, yeah, sure. Hey, I'm sorry about last night, if I came off a little... Dick-ish? Yeah. Yeah. Can we talk? Buy me a coffee. Done. So who did you ask before you came to me? No one. Well, I did ask over at the science department if they had anyone doing paranormal research. Mm-hm. Yeah, and what did they say? That kind of science is only done in the creative writing department here. Hey, listen, I've got to ask... you grandmother, she... she's not going to scare my kids, is she? No. I mean, is there anything about her that... that's... Nah, man. No, she... she helps people stop being scared. She's really not what you think. Let me give her a call. Here. If she's home, which she usually is right about now, you can meet her first. You'll see. Hey, Granny. Hey, it's your favorite nieto. No, the other one. Yeah, I get no love. I'm coming. I'm coming. Hi. You must be Mr. Peroni. Hi. You didn't tell me he was so handsome. Is he? Never mind him. He learned his manners from the state correction people. Come on inside. Now, y'all cop yourself a squat. I'll go get us some iced tea, and then maybe you can fill me in on all I'm sure Hector has left out. I'm sitting right here, Granny. I can smell you sweetie. No love... see? I get no love. And if I hadn't jumped on him when I did, I don't know where it would have taken him. That's a powerful energy you're describing. That's what I like to call 'em. I went to that Einstein fella... you know how he said he believed life had to exist after death, since energy can neither be created nor destroyed? What? I said something funny? No, sorry, it's just... just not what I was expecting. Told you. Well, yeah, but I mean younger too. Oh, I had this one's daddy when I was a little girl of 15. And Raul didn't waste no time either, unlike someone. I'm only 24, Granny. Which I'm sure is the number of girls you're with on a weekly basis. Look, I hate to be so blunt, but do you think you can help us? I don't reckon why not. I've dealt with some rather ornery energies in the past. Nothing quite like what you describe, though. So what exactly is it that you do? Well, the easiest way to put it is I share myself with them. I let them inside me so they know what I know. They're not living anymore, and they should move on. I can't always get them too, but once they know they're dead most stop doing the things that are bothering the living. A lot are grateful. They have been lost and confused, and I end that for 'em. It would be great if you could do that. My kids, my wife... we're all just, um... At the end of your rope? I can see that. And I'm willing to try. But is there anything you haven't told me? I think it might be my father. Doubtful. At least not on his own. I don't think a single energy is capable of all you described. But why would you think that? He was a son of a bitch when he was alive. I doubt dying made him any nicer. Well, y'all sure you want to go through with this? We are. Good. Then I need you to get your whole family back to your house. If, like I think, we're dealing with multiple energies, they tend to target individuals. And I'd hate for you all to move back in with some of them still there. Guys, this is Hector. Remember him from last night? Hey, guys. And this is his grandmother, Inez. Hi. Hi. You can call me Granny Inez. Everyone under 12 does. But not y'all, please. So what do we do? We just go in, or... No time like the present. I don't want to. Oh, sweetie, it'll be all right. Pinky swear? Is there any other kind? Everyone else good? All righty. Whoa, Grandma. You OK? Your father... he wasn't a happy man? No, I told you. He ended that unhappiness here. How can you tell? Sometimes places where bad things happen contain a certain residue from energies changing form. Let's go inside. He's in there. I can feel him. You have keys? Yeah, we left so fast. I don't have the keys. You all can relax. I didn't mean he was right behind the door. We'll probably have to wait at least till dark to make contact. Come on. You said the strongest event happened in Jack's room. That's right. Where's that? Upstairs. Can you show me? Sure. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... y'all can stay put. I just want to get a feel for the place. We'll be back presently. You guys want to play a game? Can we play Old Maids. Hector's real good at that one. Again, Grandma? What is it? I don't rightly know. I'm feeling a presence I've never felt before. Like? Like I don't rightly know. Like I said, I never felt it before. Not to worry. It doesn't always mean bad. Why don't we try another room? Hold on. Something happened out here. Steph and Gabby saw something. In the mirror, I know, but this wasn't your father. This is... this is... What are you doing? Could it come out of there? Come out? No, it's not in there. It never was. But it's just like how magicians use mirrors. It could trick y'all with them. I don't like to be tricked. OK, y'all grab each other's hands. Concentrate on your grandfather. We'll start with him. Well, I could just ask them to come out. Gabby. No, it's OK. How did he come out when you asked before? I never did. He usually just finds me. Well, why don't you go ahead and try, sweetie? Grandpa, will you come out? I don't think he heard me. That's OK. Try again. Grandpa, are you... Is she OK? No. Maybe. I don't know. Get out, or die. Granny. Get out. Get out. Granny? Why is your father doing this to us? It's not him. He showed me something else. It's not human. We need to leave. What is it? Granny! It's from another world. Don't let it get a body, or we'll all die... the whole planet. I never felt this much hatred in my whole life. It's laughing at my pain. It thinks we can't stop it from happening. No. Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Don't worry about me. You can't let it get a body, no matter what. Do you hear me? No matter what. Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. Jack, dammit. Jack! What are you going to do? You heard Granny. You can't let it get a body. Kent! Stay with Gabby. Mommy! I'm OK, baby. I'm OK. I'm OK. Please don't hurt my son. Please. Jack, you have to fight this thing. Please, Jack. Jack. Oh my God. What'd that thing do to you, baby? Can you hear me? Jack. Oh. Sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to. It's OK, sweetie. I know you had to. Kill him now while you still can. This is my son. Not anymore. He's not even human. Don't you dare say that. Don't you... somebody please help me. Jack. Jack. Steph, she's right. Move away. I can't. No. Please. Do you think I want to do this? That thing inside him is too powerful. No. No. No. Dammit, son. Don't throw away your family like I threw away mine. Whatever you may have thought isn't half as bad as the man I was. I know where I'm going. And it's where I deserve to be. But I'm not going alone. Goodbye, sweetheart. Goodbye, Grandpa. Take Mom and Daddy away from Jack, OK? Get back. Get away from Jack. They're gone. Grandpa took the monster away. She's right. Look at his eyes. I don't think he's breathing. He's not breathing. He's not breathing. Jack. Oh god. Come on, Jack, breathe. Come on, buddy. You can do it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's over. Put it down. What's over? What happened? It doesn't matter, sweetie. You're all right. That's all that matters. That's all that matters. So how's the leg? It hurts. Yeah, sorry about that. You were just doing what you thought you had to. Why would you even bring a gun to this house? Are you joking? I don't know you people. And besides, this is Texas. I bring guns everywhere. How's your grandmother? Well, her neck's broke, so that ain't good. But she's talking, and she's moving her fingers a little, so she's not completely... yeah. Ambulance should be here soon. What are we going to tell them? No, no, you stay here. What's going on, Granny? What's happening? Jack, where's Gabby? I don't know. Last time I saw her, she was in the kitchen getting a juice box. There were two. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Gabby! Gabby! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What's wrong? Gabby! Gabby! Gabby!
