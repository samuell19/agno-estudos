--== McEphie ==-- Showered already? Clean it. Seriously? Why don't you clean it? They're your pubes. You clean it. How many times have we talked about you not leaving hair on the soap? What's so funny? Nothing. Nothing at all. Give it to me. That's it? Done! Take it. Go back into the shower and cool down that hot head of yours. So temperamental. I may be hot-headed but at least I've still got hair. Baldy. Mr. Bene. Mr. Bene. Abner. What a handsome rooster. Is he the one you use for fights? What... What do you think? You think he's a winner? No match against the councilor's speckled brown. We'll win for sure. Bullshit. Brown? I thought he was entering the gray one. Nope, it came down with a cold. His destiny would be doomed! The rooster? The councilor. He's the most corrupt animal alive. Indeed. How is your wife? Pregnant. Currently craving Jamaican cherries. Where do you find Jamaican cherries here? Jamaican cherries? That should be easy enough. You can find them everywhere. Unlike Spanish plums. Imagine looking for them in the middle of the night. What would you know about that? It's not like you're married. I wish I were single like you. Moron. Let's go. -Be careful, this cock can kill. -Let's see. Damn, you're right. He's got good form. I told you he can kill. The councilor's brown doesn't stand a chance. What's that? What's what? The food. Chicken stew. Chicken stew? Yes. Why is it red? Stewed in watermelon. What made you-- Don't eat it if you don't want to. I was just asking. I saw it on TV the other day. And the watermelon vendor happened to come by this morning. I thought, "Why not give it a try?" Otherwise we'd have to eat fish stew again. What's wrong with fish stew? I thought you'd have gotten bored of it. I can eat fish every day. You're finicky. Just eat your food. Where'd you say you got this recipe? I saw it on TV. You know what? Maybe you should stop watching that program. Delicious, right? Have some more. When you go into town on Saturday could you buy another aloe vera plant? Ours only has three stems left. Stems? Aren't they called leaves? Stop teasing me. It doesn't matter what it's called. Doesn't it grow back when you tear one off? Probably not. It's already torn. That makes sense. You know what? I just thought of something. Why don't we just shave your head? So we don't have to keep applying aloe vera. Why? Don't you want to do it anymore? I can do it myself. No, that's not what I meant. I just think being bald might suit you. You think so? Yes. Why wouldn't it? Easy, boys. Easy. Be careful not to scratch it. Watch your step. Maybe hold onto that money, sir. It might get misplaced. Can't you give me 20,000 for it? You once said you could sell a table like that for 25. That was then. I noticed the scratches on the table leg. It's a loss for me if I sell it. But they're just scratches. They can be fixed. It's a really good table. Antique mahogany. Older than yourself. If that were a Narra table, I might have been able to give you 30. But I don't have any buyers for this. I'll have to wait for a profit. I've never lost you money, have I? Just add another 1,000. -There you go. -Mr. Bene. If you weren't a regular... How about this? I'll have the porcelain ready for you next time. And what about the house? I can sell it for you. -I have a buyer in mind. -Sure. Sell the house... and sell me along with it. You're still so beautiful. Sit up. What? Why? Just do it. Sit up. What are you going to do? Come on. There. What acrobatics are you up to at this hour? There. That's good. A little lower, please. A little lower, by the waist. Will Marissa be coming over on Sunday? I don't know. She hasn't called yet. Right there. We need to know, so we can tidy up the place. They'll probably come. Haven't missed a week yet. Have you spoken to Chito yet? A few days ago. Says he'll come. Good. I wonder what I should cook. Up to you. Anything you like. What's that called again? The watermelon chicken stew? It was a joke. -Oh, really? -Wasn't it delicious, though? Don't tease me. I know it was horrible. You'll think of something. -I'm not gonna ask you. -I said I'm sorry. Who was that on the phone? Marissa. They're coming on Sunday. I told them not to bring any food. I said I'd cook. I thought it might've been Chito. Tell me, why are you more excited to hear from Chito than your own daughter? I'm not. I asked Chito to buy me shampoo. For hair growth. I see. Mr. Bene? Let's go. Go, go, go! This fight is ours. Right there. Yes! What the hell? Son of a bitch. -We're doomed! -Finished! We lost! Give me 500. Where's your money? I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it. -It's seven hundred. -Seven hundred? Here's five, six, seven. There. Let me buy him from you. Okay. Mr. Bene. Mr. Bene? Are you going home? You wasted money on that. Let me carry it for you. Are you okay? What's wrong? You don't look so well. Let me buy you a drink. I still have 100 left. Come on. Let's go. Don't use your hands. The dish might spoil. Get yourself a fork. By the way, Chito called. Why didn't you tell me? You were asleep. He said he was able to buy your shampoo. That's nice of him. Did he say if he was bringing a girlfriend? I didn't ask. Don't you find it odd that Chito has never brought a girl over? What are you trying to say? Nothing, really. Maybe Chito is-- Are you saying he's gay? No, not at all. Maybe his standards are too high. So what if he is gay? I've got no problem with that. I don't have a problem with it either. All I'm saying is, maybe you need to speak to the boy. So he can come out. I'd like to talk to him myself. But you might say it's not my place. You know Chito is like a son to me. If you've got nothing better to do, come help me with this. Take these out of the pan. -What am I supposed to do? -Help me here. I don't care whether Chito brings anyone over or not. It's his business. Come here and help me. If you're not... You know what, I just want him to be happy. Chito is too serious, like he's keeping things bottled up. What if he explodes? What should I do? There, take all of those outside. Take them outside. That's already cooked. -Uncle. -Chito. You made it. Your mother's in the kitchen. -Here's what you asked for. -Hey. Let me see. -Is this it? -Yes. -How much do I owe you? -Consider it a gift. Thank you. Your hair's getting thicker. -Really? -Yeah. You heard him, Tere. My hair's getting thicker. Don't believe anything he says. He's an expert at flattery. Mom, don't tarnish my reputation. And to think I brought you your favorite Spanish plums. -See! -You really are something. I just saw these by the street. Didn't realize they were in season. Of course, the monsoon's about to begin. This looks delicious. Your mother cooked that. Let me try one. This one's good. How are you doing? Everything okay? I should ask how you're doing. Celso's been asking when you're gonna bring a girl over. Not anytime soon. I'm in a long-distance relationship. She's in Iligan. I see. By the way, I passed a car on the corner earlier. Might be Marissa's. -I knew it. I'll get it. -I think that's them. All right. Yeah, that's them. Do you believe me now? Cut it out. I'll have another plum. -Do you want a hotdog? -Quail egg. Quail egg again? Okay, then, quail egg it is. Let's go into the kitchen. Let's find some quail eggs there. You'll get hairy if you keep eating those. Janssen, don't bother Auntie. -Let him be. -He gets that from you. Where's your husband? Where's your father? With whom? -Does she know how to speak Tagalog? -Of course. How about Kapampangan? No. They don't speak it in school. What about at home? Aldy doesn't want us to. Says he won't be able to understand us. Chito, have some more. Your mother cooked all of that. She says the chicken stew is your favorite. Grandma. Please tell me the story of the Princess of the Quails. -But you've already heard that story. -Please? All right, then. In the faraway kingdom of the Quails, every time the Prince dies, his Princess needs to find a new prince to marry. Why, Grandma? Because that's what is expected of her. In the eyes of their people, a princess cannot survive without a prince. So she decided to travel to another land by herself to look for her new prince. The problem was, the Princess couldn't take care of herself. She didn't know how to hunt. She didn't know how to read maps. What happened to her, Grandma? She got lost. She never reached her destination. She had to settle in a different town. For how long? A long time. For years. She got old and tired. Like you, Grandma? Yes, like your Grandma. But one day, a prince came to the town and he was looking for someone to marry. And then he saw the Princess. And he promised her everything he had. Did the Princess accept? Yes, of course. But not because the Prince was rich. Because that's what the townsfolk wanted. The Princess was very old. She was scared to die alone. The Prince felt the same way. They put up with each other. Hooray! Here you go, eat your quail eggs. -Marissa? -Yes? Every time I see Aldy... he's got a new tattoo. Those things are hard to take off. I can't stop him, Auntie. The first time I saw Chito with a tattoo, I was so mad. I told him that I'd iron his arms while he slept. Really, Auntie? That's brutal. I never did it. I got used to them. But... isn't it a problem at work? Companies are more understanding these days. Aldy's getting another tattoo next month. My name. But where? Is there still room for another tattoo? On his chest. It was my idea. We've been married for so long but he hasn't even thought to tattoo my name. I'm just testing him. Oh, I see! He agreed. So now it's happening. Is that so? Chito. -Uncle. -How are you? I'm fine. This girlfriend of yours, does she have a name? What happened? She does. Hannah. Everyone has a name. Hannah. How did you two meet? Online. Yes. So you haven't actually met yet? We've met. Twice. When she was in Manila for a business trip. How long have you been together? Let me see... Almost six months. So, when's the wedding? The wedding? I don't believe in getting married. It seems... tough. What if she hits her head and realizes she doesn't want to be with me anymore? What a waste of catering expenses. Plus... you can be happy even without getting married, right? Look at you and Mom. You even have anniversary parties. Chito. You know why we can't get married. That wasn't our choice. Fair enough. Do you think I should go? Up to you. I'm asking for your opinion. I think you should visit him. He's still your husband. You were together for years. How long was it, again? Twenty-six years? Twenty-six. You can't disregard that. This is spoiled. Okay. And he's still Chito's dad. Why don't you take Chito along? You know I can't do that. Is it true? Did you really spend 26 years with Bene? Yes. I beat him by a year. So you're counting now? Not really. It's not that I'm counting. It's just that, it feels good to know that I've got something concrete here. I hope that when you wake up tomorrow, you'll still love me. Where did that come from? Look at you. Forget it. Let's go to sleep. Wait. I got something for you. I forgot to give it to you earlier. -Wait a minute. -What is it? Wait. Hold on. Here. -Open it. -What's this? What's this for? Up to you. It's neat. Thank you. Welcome. I'm going to sleep now. You've been here for a while. You're beautiful. Let's go. Enough of that. You're beautiful already. Right. Thank you. Are you okay? How long has it been since you last saw Bene? It's been a while. Right before I started menopause. That was when I saw him last. How old was Chito back then? Not even 20. Aren't you excited to see him? What's there to be excited about? Just let me know if you're getting back together with him. So I can prepare myself. You got me, baldy. Quit it. This old man. Acting like a teenager. You coming home later? Yes. It shouldn't take too long. Should I pick you up? That's okay. I'll manage. All right, then. Bene? Bene? Tetang? Bene? In case you haven't noticed, there's nothing in the kitchen. You invited a guest over and you don't even have coffee to serve? What did the doctor say? Where's the prescription? If you don't answer me, I'm going to leave. Such ugly handwriting. Why? Doesn't Celso write like that? No. Do you have samples of these meds? No. Never mind, I'll just take this to the pharmacy. You don't have to buy them for me. When's your next appointment? I'm not going back to the hospital. What are you talking about? I can't read your mind, you know? You don't wanna take meds. You don't wanna go back to the hospital. If you wanted to die, why did you ask me to come over? Can't I just enjoy your company? By the way, how did you find our telephone number? You're not that hard to find. Celso's a doctor, after all. Where's all the furniture gone? I sold it. You sold all of it? All of it. Everything that isn't here. Why'd you even bother keeping the house? Where would I go? Would you take me in? Just kidding. Tetang. Stop cleaning. I didn't ask you to come here to clean. I want to. And it's "Tere." Don't call me "Tetang." Why don't you use "Tetang" anymore? Don't like it? I'm not used to it these days. Nobody calls me Tetang anymore. How about Chito? What does Chito call you? He's the one who started calling you "Tetang." Chito is older now. He knows how to say my full name. Do you remember when Chito was still a kid? You'd make him repeat "Teresa" over and over. And he'd still say "Tetang." Does Chito have a wife yet? No. I noticed you've still got roosters. I only saw two, though. Where are the others? They've been turned into adobo by the cockfighters. I thought maybe they died from the pox again. Why do you still go to cockfights if you always lose? What if I stop today, and tomorrow is the day that I win? You're giving me a headache. Do you still sew? If you want, you could have the sewing machine. That's okay. I've forgotten how to sew, anyway. Is it something you can forget? Maybe another time. What happened? Nothing, it just slipped from my hand. Bene, tell me what really happened so I know what to do. It was nothing. Just help me clean this, please. For heaven's sake, Bene! Don't yell at me. I already told you. My fingers stiffened up, the plate slipped. Do you want me to take you to the hospital? You know my answer to that. Let me clean this up. You just sit there. Sit down. I'll do it. How did it go? How's Bene doing? When is he going back to the hospital? I know an oncologist I can refer him to. You should talk to him. What? Why me? You're the doctor. Teresa, in case you've forgotten, I'm a pediatrician. He doesn't want to take his medicine. Won't go to the hospital. Well, maybe he wants to die. Let him do it. Here. Give this knife to him. Tell him to stab himself with it. Then we can finally get married. Celso, what are you saying? What kind of doctor are you? Just kidding. It was only a joke. Wait a minute. What do you want me to say to him? I don't know. Just come with me to see him. Bene. This is Celso. Celso, this is Bene. I'll just take these upstairs. Bene. I'll be honest with you. We don't know each other personally. But Teresa asked me to come here to-- To what? To convince me to go to the hospital? Am I right, Doc? Correct. Just call me Celso. I came here as a friend. Not as a doctor. Why don't you want to go? Are you scared of needles? I'm more afraid when the doctor says, "It'll only feel like an ant bite." I'm aware that ant bites aren't that painful in real life. I won't lie to you. I don't specialize in cancer. I treat children. But I do know that the treatment for grade-IV glioblastoma will be more painful than an ant bite. The tumor's in your brain. Have you ever held a human brain? Yes. A long time ago. Why do you ask? What does it feel like? Did it cross your mind back then that you were holding not just a person's brain but their memories, too? All their ambitions. Their fears. The dreams. -Tere. -What happened? How did this happen? -Wait, do it slowly. -A splinter went in. Sit down. That's broken. -Here. -I didn't know it was broken. Bene, do you have tweezers? I do. Here you go. Thank you. Be careful. -It's gone. -Yes. Bene, don't you have any plans to get the house fixed up? Your roof looks like it's about to cave in. No need. This house and I are just racing each other to the grave. Don't you get bored here? Being alone all day? Why don't we go out? It's been a while since Teresa and I saw a movie. That's a good idea. But maybe some other time. Okay. Just let us know when. Excuse me. What happened? Stop crying, I can't understand a thing. I'm not home. Are you on your way? Where did you leave the kids? All right, just calm down. Don't tell anyone yet. I'll be home soon. Wait there for me. Drive carefully. Thanks, Pa. All right. Was that Marissa? Yes. She and Aldy had another fight. If you need to leave, that's okay. How about you, Teresa? I'll stay here for a while. If I can't find a ride home, I'll just call you. Do you have an umbrella? Looks like it's going to pour. Yes, I have one in the car. -All right. -Bene. The offer for the movie still stands. And think about what I said. I know a specialist. Okay, I'm going. Take care. Are you really going to sell these? The agent has had her eye on them for a while now. I've only found the time to clean them now. Your mother would surely have a fit. She's probably talking St. Peter's ear off by now. That's if she's even with St. Peter right now. Hey, come on. But you know, I used to be so scared of your mother. I was only 19 then. I came from Nueva Ecija, remember? Before I went to live with my aunts and take care of quails in Bulacan, I didn't know anything. I had no sense of direction. If you left me in the market, I'd get lost. But I learned a lot from your mother. She had her moments. She was kind. In her sleep, maybe. That's not true. You know, when I had the miscarriage, she was the first one to cry. She was looking forward to finally having a grandchild. It's too bad she didn't get to meet Chito. About that... Chito... Do you think you could get Chito to come over? I don't know. I really don't. Have some water. What do you plan to do? Dad, he has another woman. What am I supposed to do? Do you want to leave him? It's not that easy. Then stay with him. Dad, please. You're supposed to help me. Of course. That's why I rushed back home. Because I want to help. This house is always open to you, no matter what you decide. But it's your decision to make. You're an adult. You know what's right and wrong. What if I make the wrong decision? Right and wrong are relative concepts. There's no law that regulates the decisions we make. You just have to stand by them, and hope that they bring you happiness. All right? Here are the keys. Come here whenever you want. Bring the kids, too. Shall I close the windows? The rain's getting in. I'm going to make coffee. You want some? Bene? Bene? Bene... Bene. Bene! Where do you think you're going, Bene? What were you thinking? Are you out of your mind? I don't know. But my roosters, they'll drown. Thank you, Tetang. Tere. What were you thinking? I don't know. I can't remember. I just... It just suddenly occurred to me that... my roosters would drown in the rain. -Hello, Uncle? -Chito. What's up? It's pouring. There's a storm coming. I was just wondering if you needed anything. No, we're fine. We just stay in most of the time. How about Mom? She's in the kitchen. Can I talk to her? Uncle, are you still there? Hello? Okay, the truth is... your dad is sick. He can't be alone right now. So your mother's gone there. Why does she even need to be there? Your mom is a smart person. She knows what she's doing. We know what to do. I just don't get it. But I respect your decision. Thank you. I'm headed there now. Do you wanna come with me? All right, let's see. Your mother's inside. Come on. Tere's prepared some snacks. -There are your snacks. -Here's coffee and some sandwiches. Celso, come to the kitchen. I need some help. Come on. How are you? Fine. Happy. What are you busy with these days? Life. So... you must be making a lot of money these days. What...? What's with these questions? Why are you suddenly interested in my life? Because you're dying? But when were you ever really alive? Just because you breathe, it doesn't mean you're alive. I know... that you're angry. Angry? I'm not angry. Because you left my mother? Because my whole life, I've lived in fear that the people I love will someday leave me? I'm not angry. I don't have any anger left. I'm at a point where I don't give a damn. Thanks for coming to see me, son. Unbelievable. One cat pisses, and it floods the place. I think it's closer to five cats. I'm sorry about Chito. I promise to talk to him, don't worry. Let him be. It's obvious where he gets his attitude. What about that other promise, though? Where were you? I went to change my 3D glasses. They're still so blurry. My eyesight's bad, I can't watch this. Don't they have these for old people? What's she shushing me for? Keep your voice down. Bene? Come in. Careful. Tere, get the lights. Careful, Bene. Wait. This is why I don't like hospitals. They make me feel so helpless. I still have my strength, you know. Be careful, you might fall over. Wait, let me turn the lights on. It's good you agreed to chemo. It's what you wanted. I'm dying anyway. Might as well give you what you want. Stop it. Get some rest. -Alright, get some rest. -Will I lose my hair? Depends on how your body reacts. Would you rather shave your head? Let's go. You should rest. Careful, don't fall down. It's freezing. What about this? It'll do. He should get some rest. I should leave. Tere. Abner's leaving. Mr. Bene has fallen asleep. I think I'll head home. I hope the rain lets up. Hold on. Look at this. This is for your baby. That's perfect. She will love that. Why don't you stay for a while? Wait for the rain to stop. My wife's alone at home. She might think I'm trying to wriggle out of doing the chores. All right, then. Be careful. There are many open canals. -Yes, ma'am. -Take care. I'm familiar with this place. -Come back for this, all right? -Sure, I'll be back. I'll finish this soon. -I'll get going. -Take care. -God bless you. -Thank you. The weather's crazy. It's raining again. I hope it doesn't flood again. You know, when I see the streets flooded, I realize that I haven't seen the ocean in a long time. You know what's funny? Almost 60% of our body is made up of water. But if you can't swim, you'll still drown in any sea. Do you know how to swim? No. Do you? No. So I guess we'll both drown. Maybe that's why we never went to the beach. We're both afraid of where the waves will take us. That must be it. I can bring your food up here if you like. Tere. I couldn't hold it in. Hang on, I'll get Celso. -Can you do it? -Yes, of course I can. Take it easy. Get some sleep. Is this normal? I feel worse every day... Since I got out of the hospital. Bene, if you hadn't seen a doctor, you'd probably be dead by now. You know what? I've been having nightmares lately. Sometimes... I dream that my house is swallowing me whole. That I died alone, with only my roosters with me. Why's that, Bene? Are you afraid to die alone? I never used to be. Not really. But now... I don't know. I'm not so sure. My son, Chito, does he ask about me? Tere. Do you know why I left you? You told me, you just woke up one day and you didn't love me anymore. That I had become a stranger. You believed that? Why? Wasn't it true? Over all those years, decades, I wondered... had I made a mistake in telling you the truth? That, perhaps, it would've been easier to accept it... if I had lied. Maybe if I had told you I was having an affair. Or that I had a child with someone else. But you didn't ask me for an explanation. So I thought, perhaps, you had fallen out of love, too. But when I found out I was sick, and that I was dying, you were the one person who came to mind. I wanted to call you. I wanted to tell you I was about to die. I wanted to hear the anger in your voice. The anger that I didn't hear when I left you. But you came back to help me. And I thought, perhaps you still love me. When you told me you woke up one day and realized you didn't love me anymore, I couldn't understand it. I couldn't understand how love could just die in the blink of an eye. Twenty-six years, Bene. I didn't ask for any explanation. Not because I didn't love you anymore. But because I only wanted you to be happy. And if leaving me would make you happy, then so be it. I'm not angry with you. Not because I'm still in love with you. I'm here now... because I can face you. Because I don't love you anymore. I, too, woke up one day... and realized I didn't love you anymore. But what's sad about that is, we didn't feel it at the same time. Thank you for understanding me. Let's go. Bene? Bene, we're almost there. Bene? Bene?
