I'm talking about from years when my grandmother was a young girl, we was conceived, everybody in the world is conceived into sin in God's eyesight. None of us is perfect. But as black people, we've been pushed out long time ago. I read a book called "How to Break a Slave." It's written by Willy Lynch. You know where I'm at, youngster? - [Man] Willy Lynch. - And I remember an episode in his book, and it brings me back to when my grandmother used to tell me all these things. I used to always stay in the house and listen to all these songs and sang it for my grandmother and them, and listen at every word they spoke, I ate it with a spoon. And I remember that, thank God for it. And there's in an episode in his very book where this man said, he told the guy go get, I'ma show you what to do with these niggers. They don't wanna act right, I'm gonna show you what to do. I want you to go get me two donkeys. Put a donkey here, put one here. Tie that nigger's legs to them donkeys. I want you to go get his wife and his son, don't bring his daughter. Get his wife and his son and put them in front of it. He said, I want you to slap that donkey on his ass. And split that nigger apart. Once that black woman see what happened to her husband with her son, she gonna let that fucking nigger boy know, don't fuck with us. And that's how they broke slaves. And that's why we always had to respect, even today, we see the police, we see white people. Oh, let's get over here. Them white people are gonna think we're gonna steal. It's in our DNA. It's already in us to respect the white man. You heard me, Terry? It's already in us, my baby. But we, at one point, we want to get over it. We want to. We don't wanna live like that. And no, we've been set free, but we still being fucking slaves, goddamn it. - [Man] Modern slaves! - We still slaves because at the end of the day that woman, when she breed more children, she breed fear. When she was pregnant, she was scared. So they were born to be fucking scared. - Everything is a system. In the 80s, then they put the drugs and guns on the street. You know what I'm saying? - [Man] That's true. - They got us addicted to the guns, and that's how we started killing each other. We weren't killing each other when we was marching, with Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. You see what I'm saying? - Yeah!- Right. - So like you say, it's a psychology warfare going on. - We ain't had guns in the hood. How'd guns get in the hood? - So many black people have gotten jipped out of their work. They ain't had the, we created over the years, over centuries, and white people have capitalized off of it. Even during slavery times. Black people give all of that work for nothing, and got the hell beat out of them while the white people live high on the hulk. It ain't fair. And today we still not getting our just reward. Even you look at all of these black men getting killed, these white policemen killing them, and the law is not on our side. - How could you, you can kill a man in cold blood, but if it was one of us, if he was black, we automatically got murder, but you, they trying to find the lesser sentence that they could, which is man-slaughter, and manslaughter's really beating somebody with the bat. - Right, exactly. - [Man] Ain't no gunplay. - Right. - A dozen murders. - But they wanna shoot you, because you got dreadlocks, but look how intelligent you is. - That's right. - He don't wanna know what's inside you, he wanna judge the book before you open it up! You know? He look at you, but look how intelligent you is. - That's right. - In 2017, you that brother, that brother. - Young brother. Young, young. Young generation--- But he wanna check your style out.- Yeah. Yeah. - Because he don't like your style, but this has been premeditated, like the sister said. This been a long time ago. Why they don't respect us? Because we were never considered a people from the beginning.- No. - We was already considered animals. - [Woman] Yeah. - We don't get no justice! We get just-for-us. - [Judy] That's it, that's it. - We don't get justice, huh? - [Judy] That's it, my boy.- That what y'all are calling it? We don't get no justice. That's why the brother crossed the river didn't get no justice. That's why the brother over in Baton Rouge ain't getting no justice. - It's hard being a black person because I mean you gotta think about it every day is almost our last. We pray to God and hope that we live and wake up everyday, but to wake up and be able to go outside and not know that that could be your last time seeing your kids, or waking up to your kids, I mean, it's difficult. I mean, I have six kids of my own. It's scary. - Thanks for talking, everybody. [cheering] - It's been a struggle with me since-- - [Judy] Talk to me. - I was younger. I never thought I was gonna make it to see 23, let alone 40, you know what I'm saying? - [Judy] Oh my. [clapping] - I never knew I was gonna make it this far. - Yes. - But I have a greater understanding of life, just in general. And I have hope now, you know? [clapping]I don't fear anymore. - Great. Give me a minute, drummer. At the end of the day, all that we know see if we stick together, we will run this very world. There is nothing better than us. - [Man] If you don't stand for something you're gonna always fall for something. - And we keep falling for nothing. - [Man] You're gonna always fall for nothing. - We keep falling for nothing. - [Man] We could break our fingers, but all these fingers together is harder to break. - That's right. ♪ They said Mardi Gras morning, ran to the queen ♪ ♪ See Mardi Gras morning, Katy La Joan ♪ ♪ The Indians howling, do like you want ♪ ♪ Tell him call all Indians on the telephone ♪ ♪ Tell him get his shit together 'cause we're leaving home ♪ ♪ I said Mardi Gras morning by the break of day ♪ ♪ We got tambourines ringing, we on our way ♪ ♪ Well I called my Indians on the telephone ♪ - Five.

That's coming up, I guess. What you wanna cook? - Anything. - [Judy] What you thinking? - I like okra gumbo. - [Judy] You like that, you wanna do okra? Why you wanna do okra gumbo? - Okra, it's too hot for filet. - It's too hot for the filet. What you think, what you want? What kind of, we just had smoked sausage and hamburger. Maybe we can do barbecue? And from there we're gonna go to the bar. I'm gonna do the Fourth of July party up there. - [Dorothy] By the beach? - Yeah, up there by the bar. And I'm gonna have food there too, but I'm gonna do red beans and ribs. We'll have a big party, I'm gonna perform, the band gonna perform. Windex Pete, everybody gonna be there. You gonna be able to drink next week. [laughing] - [Man] You take the wheel off, you push it. See the valve on the inner tube? - Mm-hmm.- [Man] You just push it up. You take the inner tube out from the valve, but this one's been in there for a while so you gotta kind of work it in. - There for like two years, no? - Yeah. So. I'll work it out somehow. We might have to wait til we'll be able to cut the compressor back on though, because I might have to change that other tire first. It's a little bigger than this one. It came off another bike, and I had put it on my girl's bike, but it was too small for her. We're gonna ride Thursday. - [Man] Yeah, we riding Thursday. - [Man] Yeah. - Oh, shoot.

One, two. I got it, I got it. One, two. One, two. Don't step in the ant pile. - [Ronaldo] Why do you always bite your nails? I'm about to get in there. No, for real. I'm about to get in. I'm about to get in. T, just come right here. Just come right here.- No. - [Ronaldo] Just right here.- No! - [Ronaldo] Why you scared?- I'm not! - [Ronaldo] Yes you are! - Stop, 'cause that part's slippery. You gonna slip and fall, and you gonna fall in the river. - Oh, look at the dragonfly! Look at him! Look how blue it is! - Poisonous. You've got two of 'em. No, bro. - Just come on. If you fall, all you gonna do is just this. - That's maybe not a good idea. - Just come on. - Oh no. Come on, slow and steady. Slow, slow. Walk, walk, walk. Walk, walk, walk. Walk, walk, walk. Good, come on. Good. Good. Good. [grunts] - I'll take responsibility, but I got so many enemies around me that, and it's the very people that I love. Nobody else not gonna fuck with me in a bad way, because I'm not gonna allow nobody up on me like this. You see what I'm saying? I'm not gonna do that. It's the same fucking people that I love and wanna embrace, and wanna help, and I'm not trying to act like I'm a baller. I ain't got no goddamn money. I told you, I opened the bar with pennies, you know? I opened the damn bar with pennies, now I got it, I got it started. I made a good name for myself. My reputation is awesome. But it's no doubt, maybe I don't know how to manage money. I'm pretty good with the bar, but if I can get me some goddamn help then I can hold onto the bar. But I can't do it by my own self, and that's what I was trying to do. I said I'm gonna get the bar no matter what. I told you about Brian, my ex-husband, told you about his ass well he helped me to open the goddamn bar, we opened a bar, he helped me with some money. I was saving some money and I decided Brian I wanna get a bar. He didn't like the fucking idea. I went on and done it, because I needed something for me. Some type of security. So I did that. So now I have this motherfucker, I made this big power move and opened a bar, and knowing I don't know nothing about it, but I'm not afraid. I'm not scared. I'm not fucking scared, and I need your support. I'm going through a whole lot. I'm going through so fucking much. Well, shit. I gotta pay the rent. I don't own the bar or anything. I don't own nothing. It's just, shit I gotta pay Victor. I gotta give Victor, I guess, now $2200. I gotta give him $2200. I gotta do it in the next month and a half. That's all I got. That's all I have. I hope I make it. If not, then I'm gonna have to ride out. It's just business. It's just business. - "We want full employment for our people and we demand the dignity to do for ourselves what we have begged the white man to do for us. Three, we want tax exemption and an end to robbery of the black nation by the capitalists." - "We wanna end the capitalistic domination of Africa in all of its forms, imperialism, criminal settler colonialism, neocolonialism, racism, sexism, Zionism, apartheid, and artificial borders." That's the part you have to remember, it's a bold point. But we want you to also internalize, we believe that this wicked, racist government has robbed us and now we are depending the overdue reparations. A form of reparations was promised 100 years ago, 40 acres and a mule. As restrictions for the continue, as restitution for the continued genocide of our people, and to meaningful measure to repair the damage from the African holocaust, which we call the Maafa. The American white man owes us reparations. England owes us reparations. France owes us reparations. Spain and all of Europe owe reparations. You know, giving a job is not reparations. Getting a mortgage is not reparations. A settlement, when the police just killed your children, is not reparations. It's restitution. But reparations is supposed to be to repair, to put you back whole, to put you as a people back in the condition you were before this holocaust took place. - We do need better education, because even now, our generation of babies, they're not teaching our babies what they were teaching us then. They were teaching us that we were slaves, now that they teaching us that we came here for a better living. They're not even, I don't believe they're even really just getting down and dirty about how true evil and decadent this American society is. - We have to have our own schools. The state pays $3000 a month to educate a child, but $5000 to incarcerate. They said they built the prisons based on how many people can't read by third grade. So they make sure that children can't read by third grade. But how long are we gonna keep going to the people who enslaved our ancestors, our grandmother. My great grandmother was killed by the Klan. - "A Panther must be a vanguard example for African people at all times. In order to accomplish this great and divine mission, here she must be spiritually, culturally, and politically conscious, respectful and courteous to all people, and demand the same every term, militant, always engaged in a war in mind, and war for the minds of hearts," excuse me, "of African people, while carrying oneself in an organized and orderly fashion." - Go back. Say it again. - "Militant, always engaged in war for the hearts and minds of African people, while carrying oneself in an organized and orderly fashion. Humble, willing to release any arrogant attitudes and superior ideas of oneself, and discipline, one should sacrifice your lower personal desires for the greater good of the mission." - Black power. - Black power. - Of course, there's no cookie cutter solution to revolution, or we'd already be free. But we are in the game. And we in it to win. So we don't have no option to fail. We really don't have an option to fail. To even be a Black Panther is an honor. It's a privilege. It's not a social club. It's not a religion. We can't promise you no sweet pie in the sky when you die. That's not gonna happen. You know what I'm saying? We can't pay you like the US military. Which is basically mercenaries. You have to put in on this. Just like Harriet Tubman. Nat Turner. And any other freedom fighter. They got their freedom. Whatever you perceive can be done. If we think we can't, we won't. We have to change our, whatever you conceive, you can do. And people's hearts believe what their eyes see. We have to each one show, or we're gonna go to jail, yeah. Or somebody gonna kill you. Or people gonna betray you. Or people gonna lie to you. So what? We gotta keep going. We gotta deal with the consequences, bury our dead, and keep fighting. - [Ronaldo] Who did you fight with-- - Somebody in school. - [Ronaldo] Who? - It was a boy. - [Ronaldo] What his name is? - Kevin. - [Ronaldo] What? - Kevin. - [Ronaldo] I can't hear you. - Kevin. - [Ronaldo] Oh. Was he white or black? - He has my skin. - [Ronaldo] I'm talking about his race. - Mm-mm. - [Ronaldo] His race. You don't know what your race is? Black, white, Latino, Asian Mexican, Puerto Rican, what? What he was? Black, white, what? - Um, he was-- - [Ronaldo] He was black, right? - Yeah. - All right. So say black. Just so you know race is you black, white, that's what your race is. So he's black. Your color is like if you're light-skinned, caramel, chocolate, brown, or like that's your skin color. But not your race. So you could be light-skinned and people will still know that you're black. People know that you're still black, so whatever color you are, it doesn't matter. It's what race you are. You know how you try to follow me sometimes? - [Titus] Mm-hmm. - That's why I be so mean to you when you try to be following me, because when you're always following me, say when I go off to college or something, who you gonna follow then? You ain't gonna have nobody to follow but your friends, and here you go-- and they're gonna try to get you into bad stuff because if they end up doing the wrong stuff, like some of our cousins doing, we have three of our cousins that's in jail right now, including my dad. My dad in jail. Hit me, man. When you hit me twice, hit me hard too. No, like this. So you gotta. Like, so, put your ... No. - [Titus] I know! - Boom, boom. But look, don't do this. Don't do this, look. Don't do this. Do this. You all right. Come on. You should know why I'm teaching you how to fight. - [Titus] 'Cause I should get better? - No. To protect yourself. But you won't always fight. You don't always fight, because nowadays people don't fight. They like to shoot. But not people your age. Not people your age. People who are my age. Nobody nine years old about to come up to you with no gun and shoot at you. You still have a little time to fight, but fighting's not good unless you have to do it. All right, now swing with your left. Yeah. Now hit it with your right leg, switch. Yeah. Yeah you keep doing that. Hit me. - [Titus] I'm trying to. See? - You gotta hit me. What'd I say? Come on. - Stop, you're hurting me. - No, no. - Stop, you're hurting my jaw! - We gotta go, come on. Come on. - You're hitting me too much! - [Ronaldo] No more fighting. Stop. - Oh!- Oh lord! - Oh my god! That's deep! Wanna go in there again? I would. - We'll wait for the train. That's what we've been waiting for. The train. - You can't see the rock no more. - You know what we should do? - What? - Jump on a train and go all the way to Florida. - No! I wonder if the train's coming. Uh. - I wonder if that's the train. - Yeah. That's the train. 'Cause I know it's the train, 'cause it's gonna come around, it's gonna come around, and then it's gonna come. The train gonna come.- That's not a train. - Mm-hmm. - Why the noise going then? - Bag. - [Man] Red. - We need to catch them brothers with that Farmer's Market. Fold it with the drinks up. - Black people, we gotta deal with race and class. You throw a black woman into the equation, you gotta deal with racism, sexism, and classism. So it's pretty much what it is. But that's all that it is. The homeless, we're in the greatest country in the world, and that's like, how could you be in the greatest country in the world, and one of the contradictions of that is you have this mass homelessness. To me, don't add up right. But I think the problem is, when you talk about black people and I'm really cautious about using this term, black, because everybody who black ain't black, but if you tell my black people, and you start yelling black power, like motherfuckers go oh wait, hold up, you know, that's reverse racism, you're like, in what way, shape, or form or fashion is it? And see the thing is, white people don't have to say white power. They don't have to do that shit, because they know they'll be called racist in a flash so they don't have to do that. What they do is they legislate. I am saying, they control the power. The corporations, the Fortune 500, they control the power. So they don't have to say white power. - When you go down Saint Bernard you start seeing them. Then we go to Earhart. - They need water. - So we knocked on the tents? All right. - Water. - [Krystal] How you doing, sister? - [Man] We gonna bring it to you. - Thank you brother. God bless you. - They look at you and they keep going. Like they don't have nothing, or they cuss you out like they don't care. - [Krystal] Poor people, just general people? - Yeah. Now some of them do give you money. They give you a dollar, ten dollars, $20 or whatever they wanna give you. - How long you been out here? - [Jamie] I've been out here for almost three weeks now. - Three weeks?- Yeah. - Where were you at first? - I was staying with my auntie, but I got here. - Well, we're trying to get some exposure what's going on, and also trying to bring something instead of just coming. We're gonna do our part to do more. - All right. - [Krystal] You know, we wanna do more. - Well, if you ever need help or whatever, let me know. - [Krystal] Give her information. - I don't have no phone right now. - [Krystal] We gonna give you our number. What's your name? - [Jamie] Jamie. - Sister Jamie. - [Jamie] Yes, ma'am. - [Man] We brought you some waters and food, man. We're trying to take care. - [Man] We want to make sure you get it. Black power. - What's up? Black power, man. That's right. All right. Right behind you, bro. What's up? How you doing? You all right? We out here just trying to feed the people today bro.

What you think? - [Michael] No. - No? - [Michael] No. - Well where am I gonna put it? I want it to be seen. And somebody drinking, Picture that. Stand up and cut they fucking head. - [Michael] You're right. - All right, so I was thinking here for my daddy's picture board. Ernie K-Doe's dead. Allen Toussaint died last year. - [Michael] And I knew him. - Yeah, and Jessie Hill in 1989. - [Michael] Right. - '98, '98, '89. It's been so long. - [Michael] Right, 'cause I was gone then. - You was incarcerated. - Right. - [Judy] All that time. You weren't here when Jessie died. - Wasn't here. - [Judy] You was here when your mama died? - Nope. - [Judy] Goddammit. - I wasn't here when nobody died. - [Judy] Yeah. I thought you was home when your mama passed. - They wouldn't let me go. - [Judy] They ain't let you out? They usually let people out when their mama dies. - Well, I'm a threat to security. - [Judy] You broke away before? - No, I fight the police. - [Judy] Oh Lord, Michael. Yeah, I remember.- Do you remember. For your mama's funeral. For your mama's funeral, your mama died in what year? - I don't know. I don't know when she died. - [Judy] Put this down. Wait. Wait, wait. I need you to help me to understand something. Put this here. Your mama died, and you don't remember the year, honey? - I don't remember the year. Don't know where she's buried at. - Fuck. Why you didn't been told me that? - [Michael] Because I didn't want anybody to know. It's kind of embarrassing. - No, you don't be embarrassed with me. - [Michael] Well, I remember. - You keep it 100 with me like I do with you. Now if you'd have told me you don't know where your mama at, ain't no fucking way in the world I would have let you wander around like that. I would have put you in my car, and I'm going to do it. I'm gonna show you exactly where your mama's grave is. You gotta find some kind of closure. And maybe that's why you're not doing what you should do as a man in life. But I know your heart is sincere, and I know what type of dude you is. Whether you're clean, or running. But you've gotta find some kind of way, whatever kind of demon you got on your back that's driving you to live the way you live, it's got to be something that can help. And all I can do, you don't know where she's at, I'm gonna bring you. We're gonna get in the car, we're gonna go right there. Maybe you can go ask for forgiveness, whatever you feel you need to do to get some closure with your mama, man. I didn't know you didn't know where she was. - Sorry it's taken me so long to come see you, too. [sniffling] Man, man, man. I gotta go, Judy. I gotta go. I remember the day, I didn't make his bed up and he told me to make his bed up, I said I don't sleep in that bed. And then he beat me like I was a grown man. Do you know what my mama said? Then you shouldn't have made him mad. - You remember them pipes you put the mattress on? Them big old long pipes for the bed? - Yeah, I remember. - Remember he used to beat you with that? That pipe. I remember that. I used to be in your mama's house. Because I'd come down there to hang out with you. - Yeah, the worst thing is everybody says it's love. - Love don't love like that.- Yeah. - Love is not abusive. Love don't cause problems for the mind. Love don't break hearts. Love don't wrestle you down like a dog. Love don't lock the food in a closet and not feed you. See, I remember that. I was there. I was there. Michael, the only way you can succeed in life first, take what you've got in here. Do good man, Do good. If you keep on misusing people, your lifestyle's gonna be worse. You might wind up crawling on your belly like a snake, fucking over people, boy. You cry for your mama, so that means you have a heart. You gotta think about other people. Them people you fighting, they got family that love them. I've been bullied. I feel the same way you feel. I hate motherfuckers that fuck over people 'cause I've been there. I couldn't even read a book. That's why I can't read and write. You know who educated me? Me. I didn't listen to nothing the teacher had to say. I had no time, because I'm worried about these five motherfuckers behind me gonna whip my ass when I got out of school, so I can't think, and I want to learn, I want to write, and I want to be able to spell cat and bat and all this shit, but I can't stay focused, because these motherfuckers are already going to fuck me up outside. So I can't wait, at three o'clock I'm running home. And I didn't have to, 'cause the family's big and they got people in the family that wanna fight, but I was too embarrassed to say I was scared in school. I always was humble. And I'm saying that to say, Michael, you gotta calm down, my boy. You got to. You got to, or just 'cause people smoking a pipe, shooting heroin, snorting coke, taking pills, they got people that love them. And guess what? On top of that, they got some of those motherfuckers who come back. Because they've probably been in your same situation, got fucked up, beat up, bullied, motherfuckers taking and going in their pockets and stealing shit. Can't do it. Can't do it.

I don't know, has he got tattoos on his neck too? - [Ronaldo] Yeah, you know. Like right here. - I haven't paid attention to it. I haven't seen your daddy in years, Ronaldo. - [Ronaldo] Oh man, I ain't getting that many tattoos. I'm not getting like him. - You're not getting none. - [Ronaldo] I'm getting one. - No you're not. And I'm gonna tell him that. I'm gonna talk to your daddy. - [Ronaldo] He already know I got this tattoo. - What did he say? [Ronaldo] He said don't do that no more. - That's what he said? - [Ronaldo] Or he gonna hit on me. - That's what he said? Your grandma told him about it, huh? - [Ronaldo] Yeah. - What she told him? - [Ronaldo] She was like that, this little boy went and snuck and got a tattoo. - [laughs] That's what your grandmother said, Ronaldo? What Big Ol' say? - [Ronaldo] He just say you're wild now. - That's what he said? - [Ronaldo] Mm-hmm. - [Ashlei] He mentioned something to me about you staying with him. - Me? - [Ashlei] You staying with him. So I mean, if you do stay with him, you're gonna have to, you're gonna come by me on weekends. - Yeah. - [Ashlei] Okay. So how do you feel about that? - Good. - [Ashlei] Okay. So you don't have a problem with that? - No. - [Ashlei] All right. What did he say about the driving school? - I think he supposed to be helping with that. - [Ashlei] Okay. - I thought, like, yeah, he'd help me. I don't think he's gonna give me like a brand new car. I think he's gonna get me a used car. - Okay, and didn't he mention something about when he's on work release, he's gonna be sending money? - [Ronaldo] He's gonna be saving up money and sending me money. - Money. Okay. - Right at the cup. The reason I don't really like want to move with my dad is because, I don't know if he's gonna get in trouble again, so I probably won't see him for a little minute if he gets in trouble again, since he's been getting in trouble and he said he was gonna stop. It's like he addicted to that. - [Ashlei] Well, they say sometimes there be a curse upon you. - I don't know if it be a curse. It be, probably he wants to change, but he just-- - [Ashlei] I sure hope you don't follow in his footsteps, Ronaldo. - I'm scared to do crimes! After the experience I had with the police, I don't want to do no more crime. Well, I never did a crime. I just don't wanna do nothing dumb that's gonna put me in jail. - [Ashlei] That's just right. That's right. You see, that's a lesson learned too. You just so happened to be with them and they so happened to break into a school. - Don't. - Look what happened. And you were scared. - [Ronaldo] To death. Thought I was going to jail for a long time. - Mm-hmm. She called me up on the phone, the lady, and said this is the New Orleans Police Department. - [Ronaldo] I was so scared that you was, I thought you were gonna hurt me. - Yeah, I was gonna hurt you. - [Ronaldo] Wait, what did they say? - She said this is the New Orleans Police Department. I have your son. Then I said, you have my son? She said, wait calm down. She said he's not in any trouble. She said he was with some guys, and they broke into a school. They broke into Dillon. But I had to send someone to come get you. - [Ronaldo] I was so scared. - I know you were scared. That's a lesson learned. And guess what? How old are you? You're 14? - [Ronaldo] Yeah. - Your daddy was around that age when he first started getting in trouble. Maybe 13. 12, 13 years old his first time going to jail. - When he was like 13? - [Ashlei] Yeah. - For a long time? - [Ashlei] I don't know, you'll have to ask him. - Well my grandpa said that he was skipping school and stuff. - You don't wanna follow in his footsteps, Ronaldo. You don't. - [Ronaldo] Well yeah, man. - So you better stick to the books. Yeah? If you go stay with your daddy, okay? I don't need you picking up no bad habits. - [Ronaldo] I know what you mean. Like smoking weed. - My point exactly. - [Ronaldo] Yeah, all right. - What else? - [Ronaldo] Selling weed. - [Ashlei] Not them bad habits, Ronaldo. - I'm not smoking or selling weed. I'm not doing either one, 'cause I'm scared to do either. Well, I'm not scared to smoke, but I'm not gonna smoke. Not scared to smoke, but. - [Ashlei] Well, okay. - You look like you got a little, ah, you look like you got little twisties right there. My hair higher than yours? Ah. Chill, chill, chill. Ow, now it burns! Is it bleeding? - [Ronaldo] Let me see it. No, let me see it. I'm doing a good job. - Don't peel it, bro. - [Ronaldo] Well your hair's straight. You've got the good hair. - I know. I like this one. Wait, but where do you put the key at? Come here. Where do you put the key at? Where? You should get this one. - [Ronaldo] I don't know. - That's what I'm trying to find out. Which one you looking at, the black one? Oh yeah, 'cause that one's got tinted windows on here. It's gray. - They got TVs? - I'm trying to see. - Nope, they don't got TVs on this one. - No. That one looks cool! Got the engines. - [Ronaldo] Oh, look at the cage. Look at it. - Yeah. - [Ronaldo] Ah, get this. - Oh my god, look at the two things! Get this car. Oh my gosh, it, oh never mind. - Hopefully I'll get it when my dad gets out of jail. If he don't have enough money, he's gonna get me a used car. I don't really care if it's a used car or a new car because I'm gonna be able to get around in it. But if it's a stolen used car, I'm not having it. - So that's what happened, and that's my conversation. That happened yesterday! Yesterday. What do you want with this gin, baby? - [Man] I'll be a grass cutting clown. - But my whole thing is like being in a boxing ring. Long as we know what kind of ring, we ain't kickboxing, we ain't shadow boxing. We ain't knocking motherfuckers out. We straight fighting. We're going toe to toe, for about ten minutes straight. That's what kind of ring we in, and as soon as we believe that, we can get past that. And I understand, I mean I hate it, I hate to speak it, I love everybody, I don't discriminate, man, but I can't fucking forget what it's hitting for. And that's what it is. In Jackson, Mississippi, even in New Orleans, the South was racist from the beginning. Come on, help me! - I mean, you know we have been dealing with this, but it's just still kind of frustrating to see that somebody's head was amputated in a state that's just basically a racist state. And it's 2017, and they're like in denial. I mean, we can read the newspaper and see what we think. - [Judy] But the only thing about us, we've been having a hard time since my mama was a little girl. My mama's 87. - The newspaper article said they're trying to find out if this is a gang related incident. - You know that ain't no goddamn gang related! But guess what happened? - [Man] Did this shit in there, 2017? - [Woman] A black guy hung himself on a magnolia tree? - And yesterday. They cut this black man's neck off and put it on the porch. - You bitch! I mean, that would, now I've got to go into some crazy shit. Now you've got me in a real fucked up mode. If you cut somebody's head off. - But the thing about it, I'm sure it wasn't no black on black crime. Because black people don't kill like that. They'll shoot your ass 900 times and keep it moving. They ain't got no time to cut your fucking neck because police gonna pop up, or somebody gonna see it. So with that being said, I know, I know, it was racist, and cruel, and fucked up. And it's sad that we still live there. Whether we wanna believe it or not. We can't pretend that it don't happen because it do everyday. - [Krystal] Go ahead, knock on the door. [knocking] - Hello? - Bang on it like the police. [pounding] - Hello, is anybody home? - Come on, brother. [knocking] Somebody coming? - How are you doing? My name is Jonathan. I'm a representative of the New Black Panther Party. I just wanted to ask you a few questions. - Hello. Hi.- Sorry to disturb you, ma'am. - [Krystal] Are you afraid? - [Woman] No, I just don't wanna do it. - [Krystal] We'll just give you information just in case. So you don't have to be afraid. You can call us on your own. You wanna talk to me off the record? You wanna give me your number? - No. I'll call if I do wanna talk about it. - [Krystal] Okay. - I'm not ... - [Krystal] That's okay. I understand. - All right. - Black power, sister. Shit, I'd be afraid too, a fucking head was next door in my town. And she got children. You saw the babies, there was a kid in there. I wonder if it were the kids that found the head. Come on, brother. Double time. Mike, come on. - Sir! Okay. - [Krystal] What'd he say? - Give him a second. Yes, sir? Is it okay if I speak with you? I'm a representative of the New Black Panther Party for Self Defense. - [Man] Of the what? - [Krystal] Black Panthers, sir. - Black power. - [Krystal] How you doing, brother? - Black power, brother. - Hi. How you doing? All right? - [Krystal] Excuse me. I'm sorry. They're with us. - Okay. - I'm Krystal Muhammad, the National Chair of the New Black Panther Party. - Right. - This is our chief of staff. And we were trying to find out, we're doing like a people's investigation trying to find out what happened to Jeremy Jackson and if anybody's heard anything, I know this is a terrible thing that happened. Especially across the street from your house. So would you like to speak about anything that you know, or how you feel about what happened, or anything that you might be able to tell us to help, because we're not trusting what the police and the FBI are saying. - All I can tell you is that it happened Saturday morning. One of my tenants came over and told me about it. Said there was a head over there. I saw it from here, but I went over there and looked at it, but other than that. - We don't want people to feel like, that this kind of thing can happen and don't nobody else care about it. - I understand that. - [Krystal] We don't want people to think that-- - It's a tragic thing. But like I said, I didn't know him. - [Krystal] Right right. I can tell it's bothering you right now, right? - Huh? - [Krystal] It bothers are right now, right? - Of course. - Yes, sir. I'm gonna give you my number. All right, thank you. - [Man] This is my cell. - Thank you brother. Sorry about that. - [Man] That's all right. - All right. - [Man] Okay. - You have a good one. - [Man] Black power.- All right. Black power. - I don't hear no dog barking. [knocking] Now I hear the dog barking. - All right, come on. That house is vacant. So these cowards gonna mark niggers on the elementary school sign across the street where they put the swastika sign and the KKK. And the fucking police gonna have nothing to say, this is some kids? Even the Klan let you know it was KKK because they put KKK. The same day that Jeremy Jackson was decapitated. This is some bullshit. [dog barking] How are you all doing? Would you mind talking about what's going on here? How you doing sir? Black power. - [Man] Black power, brother. - Police came. Like you said, they don't want you to talk. - No, they didn't do nothing. They just gave us a card and went off. - [Krystal] That was it? - Yeah, so. I mean, it's a mess. It's a big mess. And now I'm stuck with trying to get everything handled, the insurance, you know how they is. It goes on. What they're gonna give, and that's it. So, they toe out all the vehicles so now I've gotta start all over again. - [Krystal] So on the way over here, where we left, we found where to body was burnt. - Right. - That's nothing but the damn Ku Klux Klan. - [Man] Yeah. - We know it's the Klan. - [Man] Right. In their nature-- - That's why we're doing out own investigation. - [Woman] You Know, we just seen on Facebook today about somebody in New York, they caught them same way. - [Man] Same way.- Same stuff. - Well they're very aggressive out here, clearly. - [Man] Yeah. - And they're trying to basically intimidate the people. - [Man] Yeah. - [Krystal] This is Klan. - And imagine how they try to explain this to the children what all this is. I don't even know how to first of all break this down to them. They ask everyday, Mama what's KKK? - [Man] If it was just for me, I'm very sure they wouldn't have took the time to get to school. - Well that's the thing about the Ku Klux Klan in the past, they would target the strong man to intimidate the not strong man. You're a deacon in the church. You have a family. You've got money, You've got houses. So they do this to you, when somebody who don't have money don't stand a chance. - See right here? They've got the little symbol. Right there. - Oh, they put the swastika symbol on the tree. - Right. - [Krystal] Well I'm glad you're all strong people. Sorry this happened to y'all. - Thank you. - Don't be scared of no KKK. Y'all got the Black Panthers. Black power. - [All] Black power! - Black power. - [All] Black power! - [Man] I'm gonna give it you, I'm gonna give it to you and you give it right back to me. Come on, come on. - [Ronaldo] And do it again now? - [Man] Let me see. I gotta come through. - [Ronaldo] There, we've got it now. - [Man] Yes. Pull that. - [Ronaldo] Do I keep doing that? - Go again, yeah. Go again. Go again. I'm gonna try the little bitty ones after this. - [Ronaldo] Right, this way? - So we're riding to take our city back from all the violence, and crime, and gentrification and all that. You know, when I ride in my neighborhood, or I'm riding on my bike, or riding in my car, I don't know half of the people in my neighborhood, then you know, everything is being gentrified now, and we're being kicked out because we can't afford rent in our own neighborhoods that we grew up in. So we light it up with our bicycles. You know, letting them know that we're not afraid, and we're gonna ride. I'll ride for whatever's mine. Because I grew up in the hood, too. So with the bikes, and with the lighting up the city, it's a sign of unity. You know what I'm saying? Like, these people are standing for something. - We'll do like you said, ride our bikes, and ride for the cause. And show them that we're not afraid. But it's gonna take more than us. You know? Our group is pretty large, but it's pretty small as well. So if we get another thirty, forty, fifty more people that feel the same way that we feel, - make a rule.- maybe we can make a change. - yeah.- You know what I mean? - [Man] Yeah, I say so. I think it's time now to take it to the street, and let's ride for our city. - [Woman] Yeah. ♪ When we riding bicycles, we take our time ♪ ♪ Indians, riding bikes ♪ Got old people with the second line ♪ ♪ Indians, riding bikes ♪ And that 8th ward crew party on the way ♪ ♪ Indians riding bikes ♪ Indians downtown, rolling 8th Ward lane ♪ - Oh hey, you're about to crash into me, bro! - I'm not crashing into nobody!

I was maybe 18, scoring, buying drugs, smoking like a motherfucker, stealing every, if it weren't nailed up, I stole that bitch. - [Woman] Took it with you. - I took it with me. But I learned. And I wound up going to jail. I was with this man that was a dope dealer. I met this man, I used to take credit cards sometimes, and I met this man, and I was asking everybody who got some good crack? And he said, shit, Big Boy got the crack. I ain't gonna use his name, but he was a big dude. And I said all right, I'm gonna go holler at him, and I brung the shit over there, my jewelry. I had some pearls worth $4,000 with a chain and two rings worth about ten Gs, my right hand to God. I brung it to Big Boy, as time went on, he was my sugar daddy. I rolled with this motherfucker, I rocked him all night. He was a big old dude. He has sleep apnea. - [Woman] Apnea, So he was going all night sleeping? - So, but he had all kind of coke. So sometimes when he fell asleep he'd keep the coke under his big-ass stomach. I rubbed that fucking dick, rocked him to sleep to steal that coke. - [Woman] That's right. - That crack. He used to wake up, bitch I hope you left me something. I ain't got nothing on this motherfucker. You done smoked all my motherfucking shit? I was where you was, and I've been clean since. I've been clean, because I didn't like the way I looked. And I didn't like the way I felt, and I didn't want what happened to me in my past to take over me. I did, girl from age of 15, I was shaking like a '57 Chevy with a motherfucking coke habit. My mama and them didn't know. My mama and them didn't even know I was being raped in the house. But I were. And fuck.- When I was young, I was molested and all that. Right now I'm like, yeah, I was my molested by my brother. My oldest brother, and my mother told me, when she found out she told me, she sent us in a room. She told us not to tell nobody. She wasn't going to the board or whatever, but he still was doing it. My little girl was one years old, okay? And he was staying at my mama's at the Holy Place apartment, and he wound up, I never told nobody this, but he wound up doing my daughter. And I went to smoking crack more and more. Forgetting about my daughter, worrying about the crack, but I was worrying about her pain and what I'd been through. - Is He still woke? Is He still woke? I can only pray that God is still awake. I can pray that He's not sleeping. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I been there, and I know what the fuck you're talking about. You'd be quiet. Back in the days, you'd be quiet. - You never say anything, be quiet. - I was there, my brother-in-law. He finger-fucked me till the whole sheet, the whole bed was full of blood. [laughing] How about that? How about that? But nobody wanna hear us. I gotta do, when I'm dating, he better not touch me when I'm sleeping. I dare him. And I love him, because he don't. He waits till I'm woke. Wide awoke. Because if he touch me when I'm sleep I'll shoot him, because I keep my gun, my little Derringer on his house, on the end table. And I told him, I don't tell him where I come from, but the motherfucker told me. He said Judy, I don't know what the fuck it is you went through, but you went through trauma. - Hmm. - And I keep the gun. He said why you got the gun? I say in case somebody come through the door. But my whole focus, don't touch me. Don't put your hand here. I go to bed buck naked. Don't motherfucking, don't touch me. I feel you.[crying] I feel you. And if it's a drug you need, if it's crack you need, smoke. Smoke one on me. Smoke one for me. Little bit of powder, snort on me. See that dope. Shoot that motherfucker.[crying] Whatever it takes to make you feel good. Go for it. Go for it, go for it, mama. [crying] - [Man Over Radio] Black Power. - [Krystal] Black power.

The game is over! Get up, get out of here. - [Titus] Stop! - I told you I wasn't playing. Get up, get up. I got you. - [Titus] Ow! - [Ronaldo] Get up, get out. Don't do that. I was scared! [Titus whimpering]Huh? Huh? I could have got in trouble if you would have got hurt. Now we've gotta go home. Come on, come on. I told you, I wasn't playing no more. I know you heard me. [Titus whining] Come on. Come on, stop. Come on. - [Titus] Leave me alone! - You have to be over here. Come over here by me. You're not going nowhere.- You're choking me! Yeah! - I'm sorry! - Get off of me! - [Ronaldo] I'm sorry. Come on, we gotta go. - [Titus] Get off of me! [crying] - That looks like Tonya's tow truck place. - Tonya, who's Tonya? Oh, Tonya. - [Ronaldo] Look at the tow truck. - Yeah. It's got to have a hook on the back. Oh snap! Good thing, four of them things right here. - [Ronaldo] You've gotta go home and take a bath soon. - Huh? - I said you gotta go home and take a bath. - I'm about to. - Put your feet on there! Want me to grab you? - I'm good. I've got you. I've got it. - It's about to go! Let me out! I wanna hop on there! - When? - Can I hop? - Yes!- You sure? - Yes, go ahead! Hurry up and run! Run before it's coming! Go, go, go, go! - [laughing] Yeah! Now jump, now get off! Get off! Get off! [laughs] I'm about to get right here. You did it! That was cool. - But next time I'm gonna stay on. I'm gonna stay on next time. - [Titus] I'm trying it, I'm trying it. - You gonna try it?- I'm trying it next time. It looked like it was easy to you so it must be easy to me. - [Ronaldo] It is! All I did was get on the first ledge. Like the first ledge--- No! - Landing of stairs, that's it. It's not really nothing. Why you looking at me? - Because I could. - You don't have nothing to look at me about. Turn your face. Turn your face. Turn your face. - I know I came a long way, boy. And I always got to express it, mama. You know I did, I came a long way. - [Dorothy] And I raised every one of them. - You did. You raised all of us. - [Dorothy] That's a pile of cooking. To feed my grandchildren when they come. - Yeah. - [Dorothy] What you cook? They do not cook and their mama either. - Nobody can cook. - [Dorothy] I did all the cooking. - Boy but I was just thinking, I came a long ways. And I endured some crazy things. - [Dorothy] I had a beautiful life. And if I died and come back-- - I didn't. - [Dorothy] I would love to live the same life. - The same life. That's a blessing, ma. I would make changes in mine. I'd do things better. I mean, I did what I, I always pulled through for you. I hope they don't make you move. But do whatever I can to help you to stay around here somewhere, somewheres. - Yeah. - [Judy] I know you don't wanna be nowhere else. - Nowhere indeed. Too dangerous. I know everybody. - I was comfortable at the bar. When they told me I had to leave, I was shaking in my boots, 'cause that was my space. That was Judy's space. And this yours. No matter what you have in here, you ain't got the best, or too much, but it's beautiful, it's gorgeous, and it's lovely. - I feel comfortable. - [Judy] It's homey, and we all come here 'cause we feel it. We come here right by you to eat, and live, and breathe, and take a shower. We're getting showers in your house. Some of us have nice spots, houses and comfortable, and we wanna be here. And you don't wanna be nowhere else. It's not good for your health. But they're gonna do some things. They had their client out there today. I saw it. - [Dorothy] They didn't tell me. - They ain't gonna tell you! It ain't about you no more. It's about paper. They ain't gonna tell you. The landlord's daughter. His niece. She running the show. She ain't gonna tell you that she's got somebody out there about to buy. The people that took my bar, they ain't tell me who was getting my bar. They lied and said I ain't paying my rent. And you know better than that. The rent was nothing but $1,200. I made that in four days. Two sometimes. But when it is about money, mama. It's all about paper, man. People are doing bad, ma. All we gotta do. - [Dorothy] I'll find me a job. - [Judy] No, you don't need a job. You can't work, mama. - [Dorothy] I've gotta do something. - You worked all your life. You ain't gotta-- - [Dorothy] I ain't worked all my life. - I ain't got the bar no more, so I can't do much as I used to, but I tell you what. You know one thing. When I come up, you come up. And you told me, when they took the bar from me, you know I paid my rent every month. I paid all my bills every month. They took the bar from me, and you told me, you said Judy slow down. It's just business. It's just business. - [Dorothy] Well baby, I'm gonna get myself together, because they did that, they're showing the people the house so they can sell it. - Well, we got the wrong kind of people coming in. They wanna take our culture, they wanna take the breath that we breathe. Everything we say, they eat it up, and I'm worried now. - [Dorothy] They sold three houses down the block. - Oh no. Don't worry about it. It's gonna be just-- - 'Cause I sure ain't going in the East. - [Judy] You ain't going in the East. They kill for recreation in the East. You ain't going out there, baby. Not long as I'm breathing. You ain't going out there. But don't let it get the best of you. - I didn't even know. - [Judy] Don't worry about it. You got a daughter with a whole two-bedroom. So don't worry. All is well. - [Ashlei] So why they had to call me from school and tell me you didn't understand this? - I do understand it. - [Ashlei] What's funny? - Nothing. - [Ashlei] So when I come to that school tomorrow, what, then? - I'ma understand it. - [Ashlei] So why'd they have to call me on the phone? - 'Cause I wasn't doing it. - [Ashlei] Why? - It was boring. It was. - [Ashlei] What you mean, boring? School is not boring. - They don't give us no answers, I mean, no questions or nothing about it. All they do is tell us read. - And you're not playing football, all the activities is cut until you get your schoolwork together. What's the problem with you and the teacher? - I don't participate.- Why? - I don't like that teacher. He always like tell me something. - [Ashlei] So he picking with you? - Yes. That's what I feel. He's picking with me. - [Ashlei] No. - Yeah. He always say he liked me. He wanna tell you that. Ronaldo thinks I has it out for him. - [Ashlei] He told me that. I told him, Ronaldo do thing you have it out for him, he said it's not true. So you just want all your teachers to be nice to you like you're in kindergarten. - I want them to be nice to me because once they're nice to me I'll be able to cooperate with them. That's-- - [Ashlei] Wrong. Nobody gonna be puppying and babying you there. That's what you want them to label you? Their little pet? - They ain't gonna label me that, because I'm gonna make a statement when I go there. Just 'cause I'm in ninth grade doesn't mean that y'all can think I'm an underdog. Everybody tell me that someday I'm gonna be an underdog, just like-- - [Ashlei] What they mean, you gonna be-- - Just like, the fifth graders and sixth graders and seventh graders are underdogs, I'm gonna be an underdog. I don't care. - [Ashlei] What they mean you gonna be an underdog? - They mean they gonna be able to mess over me. Okay. - [Ashlei] Nobody's gonna try to mess, I'm talking about your teachers. - Oh, well. - Nobody trying to mess over you. You. It's you. You're the problem. You have to do what you need to do to get out of that school. You've got to do your homework. You got to study. You gotta do your classwork, you gotta listen to your teachers, you cannot play with them clowns, Ronaldo. You think, you're not listening then what you think Titus is gonna do? What do you think your little brother gonna do? - [Ronaldo] Not listen. - He's gonna say, well Ronaldo's getting away with it. I can get away with it, too. You have to listen to them. They want to see you fail. They want to see you fail. And you're falling right in their trap. You fall in their trap every time. So what you gonna do? As far as your work, I'm talking about. - My work? - [Ashlei] And your mouth. Your mouth. Hmm? - I'm gonna start doing it. - [Ashlei] What I told you to do? To do what? - Ignore them. - [Ashlei] Ignore them. If they something to you, okay. Yes ma'am, yes sir. You have to go back and forth. That's what got you in trouble now.
