[sings devotional song] [mumbles] Oh! Excellent! What a gifted voice! Oh! [mumbles] Next level! [laughs] [laughs] [devotional song continues] [mumbles] Such elegance! Oh! Looks like she won't stop! Very fanta-- Hey! [laughs] Very nice! Keep this. Thank you! [laughs] Dear students! You would have seen a lot of other cases! But, this one is a very very peculiar one! Take a close look at her! Lakshman! What do you feel? She sings well! Really nice! Can I get her number? Oh! Are you trying that approach? No! Her case sheet number! Just to get to know her condition! Oh! You mean that! I'll give it! For sure! But before that, I need to say something really important! It'll make you a little more attentive in class. [whispers] I'll show you something! You guys observe this! Okay? Huh? [breathes heavily] Give it back doctor! NO! [heavy breathing continues] Give it back doctor! I said "NO"! You won't give it back? No way I'm giving it back! HEY! [grunts] [grunts] Guys! Watch what she's doing! Just watch no! [groans] Give it back! Give it back! Leave her! Leave her! Argh! God! What a punch! Must be at least 350 pounds! My jaw was left hanging! Hey, this is the problem with these patients! They look very normal to those around them! Well! This disease is a symptom of increased anxiety disorder! All you have to do is say "no" to them! They'll turn wild and aggressive! Because... They might have faced extraordinary disappointments in their life! That's the first hint! Now tell me! Do you still want her phone number? No sir! No sir! -Ah! -Sir? Ah? Today's class was very interesting! Will she come back tomorrow? Oh you are from that category, eh? -Uncle! -Hi Shakthi! What's this uncle! Everyone rushes to a doctor if they get hurt! But here, the doctor looks hurt! It's a freak accident! What to do? It's part of my life and part of my job also! [laughs] Now that your bachelor's degree is done do you plan to do a master's? I'm keen on pursuing a master's degree, uncle! But there are many commitments! So I need to get a job! But wherever I go they ask for a reference letter! If you could help me with that... That's not a problem! Ha! Uh. During times like these your parents aren't alive to take care of you! -Hi sir. -Hi! That makes me sad! So, what kind of a job are you looking for? Uh. Social media marketing, analyst. I want to give these fields a try! Very nice! [laughs] You are the most famous doctor in the city! If you could give me a recommendation letter-- Why do you even ask? You can step in anytime tomorrow morning and collect it! Thank you uncle! Be happy! Take care, bye! Thank you uncle! [mumbles] That punch still hurts! [waves crashing] [grunts then groans] Hit him! Call him now! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Do you think we'd back off if you call your guys? Hey! Ramu, where are you? Some four guys-- [groans] Five guys are thrashing me! Just tell me where you are! At the old paint godown! By the time you finish counting up to 100, -I'll be there! -What? 100? [groans] What are you talking? Please, let's take a small break! Hey! When will you come? Hey! I asked you to count to 100. Hey! I've counted to 110! Count up to ten again! Another ten? [groans] I'm on the way! Hey! [breathes heavily] Please, let me go! Please, I'll pay you! You are showing off throwing around names, acting like a hotshot! Please don't hit me! Call him now! Phew! You guys are dead! HEY! Who the hell are you? We thrash him and you turn up? He is my cousin. Cousin? Until my last breath, I won't let anyone touch him! Can't touch him? Hey, kick him then! HEY! [groans] What the hell? COUSIN! I won't allow anyone else to touch you! You saw that? I won't do as I say and I won't say as I do! Hey, what is he even saying? I don't understand a word! You don't understand? HEY! HEY! [grunts] [groans] Cousin! -Trust me! -Huh? I won't let anyone lay a finger on you! Cousin! [choking] What--? I'm here for you! [groans] Cousin! I'm here for you! Stand up! Grab my arm! I dare you to hit him! [choking] It hurts man! Hey! Hey! Are you still holding on? You stay safe! [whines] HEY! No brother! It's enough, brother! It's enough, brother! Anything more than this would kill him! Even if we hit him, we couldn't have done this much damage! Do you know why we ganged up on him? Why, sir? He borrowed five lakhs from me! He gambled and lost! He was giving us the slip all these days! That is why we thrashed him! Wouldn't you give your life for your cousin? Pay back the five lakhs he owes! Okay, sir. I'll pay. I guarantee it! I'll wait a week! If you don't pay the five back it'll become ten! Okay, you can leave now! I'll take care! -Hey! -[winces] Why would you ruin your life over a game of cards? Okay! Hope you are unhurt? [whimpers] If anyone gangs up on you give me a call! Good heavens! I won't! Ever! No matter the problem, I'll never call you for help! Wow! You look so pretty! [mumbles] Oh! This damn thing! Ruins the moment! Hello! Hello sister! Ursula is here from Germany! Oh, has she arrived? The meeting at ten is confirmed! Oh, fix the meeting! I'll be there. I'll make the arrangements now. You can come there directly. Thank you! Bye, dear! Hey, Renuka! I asked you to keep a matching set of bang-- [slurred] It's over there! Oh! She's kept it ready! [laughs] What? Nothing... -You look... -Umm just like actress 'Urvashi'! Huh? Why are you buttering me up early in the morning? Renuka told me. While cleaning your room, she found broken bottles everywhere! Careful! You might cut yourself up badly! -Then... -What then? -Can I... -Um. Tag along to meet Ursula? Why do you want to meet Ursula? Remember last time? You act like a decent guy at home! Once you get there, you start getting all flirty! There's no need! Why haven't you dyed your white hair? I look so young! Won't people think I'm old, because of you? I've stocked up the house with hair color! Use that to look young, okay? Listen! There's mutton biriyani today! Watch those TV soaps you like, stay home like a good kid! Smile now! Ha! ha! Come on! Come on! Super, brother! Come on, careful now! -Sister-in-law! -Um I want to talk to you about something very important! Tell me, tell me! -Umm -What? What? Boston University, US has offered me an admission in their master's program. [slurred] Congratulations! I've made arrangements for you to study at Madras University by influencing a professor I know. By then, you've planned a trip to the US? No, sister-in-law! I've always wished to study abroad for a very long time! Just because you wished for it? Now, look here! I know what's best for you! And I'll make it happen! Your wishes mean nothing! Why? Is she talking about touring America? She says she wants to study! Where's the harm in that? Now, look! I'm far more vested in your sister's well-being than you. Studying abroad won't work out, I know that much! Sister-in-law! I thought only my dreams would go to waste! New York Michael Jackson Academy, offered a dance scholarship to me! But you didn't want me to travel that far! You wanted me to learn from Kala master instead, putting an end to my dreams! I won't let her suffer the same injustice! At least let her fulfil her dream! -NO! -Who are you to say no? This is my father's hard-earned wealth! Hey! He's our father! Quiet! She has rights to his wealth too! What if she has rights? Shouldn't she act responsibly? True that! Why did your father, lacking faith in you three, name me in his will? Because I'm responsible! Just because you are wealthy you are adamant about studying music in America! You are adamant about studying dance in America! That won't happen. Ever! I know what's good for this home! I'll dictate what happens around here! -SISTER-- -RAM! Would you do this to your own daughter? [crying] Oh no! Did you hear what he had to say? If I had a child, wouldn't she support me? He's mocking me for being childless! This! This pumpkin head! [sobbing] My time will come soon. [mumbles] Let's wait for "Veetla visesham"! [sobs] How would it happen! -She sleeps on the bed alone -[mumbles] Not this again! I sleep on the couch! Is this how a brother speaks? How can we have a child then? We can only sleep in peace! [mumbles] The booze has made him unbearable! Don't feel bad about this. [mumbles] I didn't even feel bad about the thrashing I got! Don't cry! You'll study in America! That's for sure! Understood? I'm here for you! Thanks, brother! Thank you! You've told Ram, right? I'm also depending on him. He'll take care! [laughs] My goodness! Do you really have to? Alright! Alright! Okay! I feel very... My God, my God! [laughs] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Oh! Please! Please! Please be seated. We started this club twenty five years ago! Our club's first pillar and backbone is our Sharadha madam! To talk about her untiring work and about her would keep us here forever! Sharadha Textiles. Sharadha Exports. Sharadha Finance. With so many businesses in her hands, she has a busy schedule to keep! Yet, she does a lot of social service! The only reason for that is her affection for the public! Madam, please. A few words from you would motivate us! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! My greetings to all you lovely people from across the world! Friends! We've all accomplished so much! We donate so much! But why haven't we reached the people yet? That's because... We aren't up-to-date on social media! No one wants to give us the publicity! Everyone is jealous! -Madam! -Yes! Shall I go street-by-street distributing handbills! Or can I ask the poster guy Nandakumar to paste posters across town! Those are old ideas! We need the latest! We need to update ourselves on social media! Even though you look old, I feel that you are all young like me! Huh! Please close the door! Please. You are all from the old generation! Please turn youthful like me! Think like one! Okay? We need to find an adminsitator who knows social media marketing well! For our club and for my personal needs too! Latha! Yes, madam! Arrange for an interview! I'll take care of all the expenses! Okay? Of course! On the occasion of our 25th-year silver jubilee celebrations! Not just the public, but the entire world should pay attention to us! Don't pay attention to me! The world should look at us! Madam. What are you saying? My plan is... Call all the beggars in our neighbourhood to assemble. The service we do to them should become viral on social media! That is my plan, okay? Madam! Shall I then... book a photographer and a videographer to cover the event? Why? Why? Why should we waste money? There are two "waste rices" in my home. Please call them! They could be useful for something! Okay madam! -Latha! -Madam! Save these for next year! Okay madam! Take it, grandpa! Have a nice day! Thank you! Take it brother! Say "thank you!" Okay! All the very best! Okay! God bless you, grandpa! Look here! Here! God bless you sister! Sister, please take it! Okay! Please take it! I want good snaps! We should look glamorous! The chilli flakes and oregano is inside! Sprinkle it before you eat! Does my face look good? Everything looks good! Aunty! Ready! [mumbles] I've asked you not to do that when we have guests! Call me "madam"! -Ready, ma'am! -Okay. Action! Yes! Okay! Greetings everyone! What's this? This club has been functioning for twenty five years! You may ask "why are they handing out pizzas to beggars?" Why? Why? It's not imperative that beggars of our country should eat only leftovers! Are they not supposed to eat costly foods? I'd like to elevate our beggars to the standards of international beggars! With that good intent in mind this club has begun this drive! Every week we should change our menu, no? This week, as you can see we've given them pizza. Next week it's... [whispers] Pasta! Pasta! What about the next week? Burger! Burgers for these beggars! I have a lot to say, come with me! -Chin down. -Come on! [mumbles] Take good photos, you knucklehead! Bite into it! Bite into it! Hey! You pay to eat this? Brother, this is to look stylish! Not to appease hunger! Everyone in our country who eats pizza ends up eating curd rice before going to bed! -Understood? -Okay. Give me some betel nuts! Betel nuts? Hand me those chilli flakes. [mumbles] God of wealth! Hope you reach me safe and sound! [sighs] [mumbles] I've got to shut up just because he's my wife's ex! He looks like a cockroach dancing on the table! [radio] 'and we follow the song,' 'with the corona news bulletin!' 'The honourable Chief Minister' 'has made an important' 'announcement.' What? 'From today, all tea shops' 'are allowed to' 'operate at fifty percent' -What? -'capacity of customers!' Fifty percent? [radio fades off] What does he think of us? Hey! You look like a fifty percent discount! Your drink is free! Drink up! -What the hell? Free? -Why? What did you say when we got married? What? What did you tell my father? I said I'll slap him! I've lost everything after marriage! I haven't seen a dime! My life is chained to this stove! You promised to buy me gold earrings! You promised to buy me a gold chain? Look! I have nothing! How did you even love her? You've ripped me off! You and your stupid face! Hey! Shut up! We have a customer! Once upon a time, women trusted their husbands! She complains about gold, jewellery, and tickets to "Beast"! Cousin, tea or biscuits? There isn't a rupee to run the shop! Tea and biscuits? Huh! When I open the shop, this rat face comes along! I'm going to poison this rat someday-- Huh? [gasps] Babu! Ramu! -Dude! -Bro! -How are you? -I'm good man! It's been ages since we met! You still look the same! -Sit! Sit! -Cousin! -Do you know Babu? -Sorry! Our school annual day. Fashion show! We couldn't find a model! He was the one who saved us by modelling for us! -He rocked the ramp walk! -Huh! This guy? Modelling? Get lost, pipsqueak! What happened? Hey! [whispers] Model? Looks like an ox! Hey! Who the hell is he? How dare he mock me in my own neighbourhood! Should I wear my "Sarpetta" boxing gloves? -Hey! Hey! - What? Keep your cool! He's my cousin! I thought so too, the look on his face. Hi cousin! We're friends from today! Dude! Why do you own a tea shop? I thought you'd be a famous model by now! What the hell happened, dude? Dude! I'm not in the tea shop business! My business is "number two"! What's "number two" business? Breaking and entering! You sinner! Do you break in and rob houses? Don't say it out loud, she can hear! Hey! You can hardly call it robbery! Is it wrong for the have-nots to take from those who have? That is how I was able grab this shop from Sasi chetta! Do you get it now? Huh? Dude, let's talk about you! I knew you'd be a great dancer by now! I heard you choreographed the dance for "Arabic Kuthu"? I dreamt of being a great choreographer one day! There are too many youngsters in our country with big dreams! Far too many! They turned me into yet another engineer! I'm jobless after graduating! [mumbles] These guys won't ever realise that no work is beneath them! Okay, dude! Forget about it! Now that you are here in my shop, it's my treat! Hey! My friends are here! Take good care of them! This is also free! Got it? Free? I need to get rid of you first! Dude! I can already feel like I've had too much tea to drink! I'm happy to have met you! I'll leave then! Bro, a small gift! I'll take leave! Thanks for the gift, dude! Keep it at home! Don't throw it away! Lose him! We'll do a round of Jim and Daniel! Call me! He's very expressive! -Hi, cousin! -Bye Ox! Sir, when will my daughter be discharged? Mr. Sundaram! We have no intention of keeping you away from your daughter! She's responding to our treatment now! Did you meet her today? No sir! One minute. Okay, doctor! Hello! The patient in 401, Shakthi. Send her in! Send along the discharge summary as well! Okay? Dad! Shakthi! Wow, it's been ages since I saw you! Perhaps three months, dad? Oh, yes! Yes! Doctor! People always complain how hospitals charge a bomb! But you folks! You've used my money to save my child! Doctor, what I'm trying to say is-- Uh! Keep your distance! It's nothing much doctor! My girl is about to be married. So if you omit this from her medical certificate, I will pay a little extra to you! HEY! Shut up! What do you know about her illness? Do you think she has the flu? My conscience wouldn't forgive me. Because her illness could flare up anytime! Get lost! [mumbles] Must be an honest guy! Hello! Hi Shakthi! Your recommendation letter is on my table! You are free to pick it up anytime! [mumbles] This must be it! Yes! Yes! Nandha, get the car ready. Inform madam I won't be home for dinner. [mumbles] Time to make the switch! Excuse me! That's for Shakthi... -I'm Shakthi. -Hi! -Bye! -Bye! Shall we leave? Is this mine to keep? Yes! Yes! It's yours! This is 'our' dad's hard-earned wealth! And our house! Look at us, drinking in secret. And all of this is your fault! [slurred] Hey, Ram! I've been drinking since I was young. The age gap between us was 20 years when dad passed. And so, your sister-in-law was given the power of attorney! I know it's all my fault. My fault! But think about it, Ram... Who else do I have besides both of you? Who do I have? How is that when I talk something seriously you shut us up by talking emotionally? Look. I don't know all that. Brindha must fly to America to study! And needs 10 lakhs for it! Cousin? Okay. She needs 20 lakhs for her studies! Do this. Open that locker inside and take out just 20 lakhs! Hey! Is this why you called me to drink? Don't you take Sharadha for granted, boys! She's a smart woman! You know what she did? She's built a room to stash all the cash. And set up an electrical circuit that flashes colorful lights! If anyone tries to enter that room, a loud alarm will go off and send a danger alert to her! Unaware of this, you know what I did? I went inside to take out some money. I was electrocuted when I put my hand in and couldn't use my hand for three days! I don't care if your hand or leg didn't work! I want 20 lakhs from there! Brindha needs to study! Ah, yeah! 20 lakhs is the exact amount! Her education is important to us! Do you know poker? Yes sir, I know. Tell me what flush is. A flush... ...is in the bathroom! Do you play online rummy? I play, sir. How many cards do you play with? Thirteen cards, sir. Very good. They said this was an interview for a marketing job? Just answer my questions. Got that? Do you want this job or not? I want it, sir! I'm sorry, sir! Please continue. How many original sets do you need? A minimum of three sets, sir. It can either be with three cards or four cards. If I asked you to play, would you? -Sir? Of course! -Very good! I really like you! I think you're the right fit! I'll put in a word to the General Manager. It's my cousin so don't worry about it! [all] Good morning, sir! Cousin, the first round's done and I-- Move aside. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Regarding your salar-- Please sit. Sir, I'm Shakthi. I'm a graduate in English Literature. I did many cultural events in my college. And I'm a very hard worker! I'm a team player. Also, I'm well experienced in the field of Public Relations. So... Ask me anything and I'll answer, sir! Are you married? Sir? Sir... It's mentioned in my resume that I'm single. Can I ask you something irrelevant? Yeah sure, sir! Do you have a boyfriend? Sir? No, sir. You're selected! Sir? How was I selected without a proper interview or looking at my resume? When you look at someone, you'd instantly know whether they're the right fit! You are selected. Congratulations. Thank you, sir! Thank you, sir! Thank you so much, sir! The door's that way! Thank you, sir! I'm a very very hard worker! I'll give my 100 percent! Thank you so much, sir! Oh gosh! Why do you stink so bad?

Why are you dashing into me? The interview is done, sister-in-law. Who did you finally selct? She seemed best out of the lot! -I've selected her! -Hi, ma'am! Oh, hello hello! Hello, ma'am! -What's your name? -Shakthi. Oh, nice name. Nice name! Okay, Shakthi. Your job doesn't end with social media managing alone. Okay. All my business matters, -my personal matters... -Okay. Everything is in your-- What about TikTok? So silly of him to forget the TikTok ban! [murmurs] It was I who forgot to tell you. You should attend to me in a jiffy! Yes, ma'am! You can stay here, too! Okay ma'am! We'll provide your stay. Ma'am, here's my reference letter. Ram's decisions will never go wrong! Because he tends the bar-- I mean... He's inquisitive and thorough in reasoning! After all, he's 'my' brother! Yes, yes! Ma'am, have you heard of Dr. Ilancherian? Dr. Ilancherian? This letter is from him! Oh, really? It'll definitely be right! This was from him! Then why did you interview her? I've known doctor for a really long time! Such an honest man he is. And that's why I'm fond of him. 'The woman bringing' 'this letter, Shakthi...' 'Due to many' 'disappointments in life,' 'underwent treatment' 'at Peace Hospital.' 'Although she may seem innocent,' 'if anyone uses or' 'says the word "no",' 'she would attack them' 'viciously like an animal!' 'So try as much to' 'give all she asks for.'

Thank you so much! This is your house from now. Hey, come! Call me if you need any help. -He's my cousin. -Hi! Consider him your brother. What, Preethi? I can't feel the love in your touch! How will you feel? For three months, you said you'd open about our relationship at your place. When are you going to? How long will I keep working in this massage parlor? Darling, don't you know my sister well? I'll tell her when the time's right! You keep spinning the same tale! I don't think you love me anymore! Love me anymore? Is this enough? This? How about this? How about now? Will this suffice? Why are you silent? What music is this? Happy birthday. But today isn't my birthday. I know. It's your lunar birthday! Oh. Is that so? Can I ask you something? With pleasure! I was hired for my talent, right? Definitely not. Then? But for your taste. You have very good taste. A special gift for your birthday. Here you go! Your favorites. Oh my God! Both are my favorite movies! I know! But how? [romantic Tamil caller tune plays] Hello? 'Hello, sir. I'm Rekha,' 'calling from ICU Bank.' Tell me, Rekha. 'Your personal loan' 'has been approved!'

Hey! Who the hell are you? Forget all that. If you don't want me to send them to your sister... Come to the said location as soon as possible. Where should I come? -Sir? -Hey, you! Will you blindly come if anyone says it's urgent? Who are you, sir? How did you get hold of these photos? When an influential guy visits a masseuse weekly, you thought no one would notice? Sir! Nothing of that sort. I truly love that girl! You say truly love her. Does your sister know about this? Sir, please don't tell my sister! I'll do anything you say! Please! Really? Sure. Fine. In 24 hours... Bring me 10 lakhs. All I can do is pray, sir! Hey, you're paying! Sir? Seems a bit expensive. Give me some time, sir. Take your own time! I'm giving you 24 hours! Sir... You make it sound like it's 24 years! If the money doesn't come after 24 hours, each picture will be sent to your sister's WhatsApp and uploaded on social media! Sir? You sound like a villain from James Bond! What an emotional guy! Fine. I'll give you an 'Aadi' discount of 40 percent. Six lakhs rupees. In 24 hours, you're handing in the cash! I'll bring it to you somehow, sir! 'How are you so easy to convince?' Quick! Leave before I change my mind. Chop chop! Sir? Please don't leak them to anybody! I'll somehow deliver the cash! [slurred] Hey, Ram! My only companion at night is now under repair! You're the owner of this house. And yet, you're treated as a watchman! Are we getting proper replies? Why is he dressed differently? Hey! What? What is this costume? Holy ash on your forehead! Are you turning into a godman? I would have been well off had I been a godman! Why do you say that? When every Tom, Dick, and Harry say that you're childless my heart aches a lot! For you to bear a child, I've made a vow to present a golden spear to our ancestral deity. I would rather beg around to fulfill this vow! Why do you take such an extreme measure? Weren't you born into wealth? Or am I not your sister to help you out? You tell me the cost of that spear! Only six lakhs! Just six lakhs? Okay, put it on the tab. Write six lakhs in his name! Pass that! Write an extra lakh in his name! Okay ma'am. Keep it for expenses! Why only buy a golden spear? If you tonsure your head, pierce a spear through your tongue and do gymnastics on a firepit, your vow will be fulfilled soon! Don't listen to him. You go in peace! Thank you, sis! Brother! Looks like she's in a good mood. Can you ask her about my studies? -Sister-in-law? -Yeah? When you can immediately give your brother some money, why do you delay in giving when my sister asks? That's 'your 'sister. And he's 'my' brother. That's 'your' brother! And that's 'my 'secretary! You're separating us apart and you've never asked me as a family member! You're bothered about 'your' sister's college fees but did you bother to ask 'your 'sister-in-law that? Why will I pay your fees? You never went to school so how will I? Did I ask you that? Did I really say that? Look- Look at him twisting my words! Hey. Hey! Why are you staring at her? I know for what and why to spend for in this house! You don't lord over me! Look at their faces! Listen, the cooker whistle has gone off! The biriyani's ready. Mutton biriyani! All of you go eat. Hey hey! The whistle's gone off! Biriyani is ready. Let's go! Hey! All your fault! I'm speaking on your behalf as well. Hey, hey! It's working! -It's working! -[groans] It's playing so loudly! Raise the volume. Ram! -Raise the-- -No! No! Dear! Please don't panic about this. This is our family affair! Hey, stop that! Don't panic, okay? Hi, Sharadha ma'am! Hey. Why have you casually entered? It's been 24 hours since I heard from you! And you didn't answer my calls! Where were you? Sharadha madam! You will be shocked to hear where I was! Fine, tell me. I went to meet His Holiness Sukranandha! Really? Yeah! He doesn't meet anyone though! How did you meet him? I too didn't see him, ma'am. But, I went to his ashram and prayed for you! Give! His Holiness! -Sukranandha? -Vikranandha? Who's that? When he sets foot, even a desert turns into a oasis! He's coming here to perform the 'Putra Kameshwari' ritual for you! Will he actually come? He's coming here this full moon day! Coming full moon... Coming full moon... One, two, three, four... My mind's scrambled... There's a week to go, ma'am. Oh, we have a week? Okay okay. Everyone- Everyone will be vegetarians, now! Ram! Don't roam around unnecessarily. -Start fasting, okay? -Okay. I'm saying this for you too, dear! Everyone must fast! Okay ma'am No one should eat meat. He'll curse us if you start drinking! Cheers! Listen, Shakthi. The house must be grandly set up! Seeing that, his heart must brim with joy! Don't worry about the expenses! Yeah, ma'am. I... I... Full moon day's fast approaching and I'm starting to panic already! Move. Move away! [starts chanting mantras] The puja room's this way! Oh, yeah yeah! This way! I've never seen ma'am this happy before! [vehicles whirring] Sadha, can you please pick up the phone? Is everyone deaf in this house? Sadha! [groans] Pick that call! Where is it? [phone rings] Why isn't it... -Hey, Ram! -Yeah? Can you check this phone? I think the display's gone. What phone is this? How will you attend if the phone's flipped? Are you drunk in the morning? Here's the display. Okay fine, got that! Answer the call! She's already angry. Hello? 'I'm calling from the ashram' 'of His Holiness Sukranandha.' 'And I'm his long-term disciple,' 'Anandhakuttan, speaking.' Yes? 'Swamiji had obliged to do the' 'Putra puja this full moon day.' Oh really? That's good news! 'All of a sudden...' 'The cousin of Ambani had' 'requested a Lakshmi Puja.' 'Since they pleaded immensely,' 'we won't be able to come.' Oh, those poor people! 'He will arrive on another day' 'and asked me to inform you'. 'Before our arrival,' 'we have certain procedures' 'that must be followed.' Okay, when will you arrive? '"No one knows when' 'and how we arrive' 'but we always arrive on time!"' That's right. How will you arrive without knowing the address? 'We know the addresses of all' 'and all the streets within.' 'Hail Sukranandha!' Hello? Looks like a godman who watches a lot of tv! Brother! I've received a conditional offer letter from Boston University! Oh. The initial payment is 13,500 USD. How much is it in rupees? 10 lakhs, brother! I see. Okay, I'll take care. I'm really excited, bro! You'll pay it on time, right? I said that I'd take care. Then, why do you-- Cousin! Cousin! Don't worry, okay? Cousin! Please talk. Who's that? He wants to talk to you! Please. -Hello? -Hey, it's been a week! I've not seen or heard from you! Oh it's you, sir! Looks like you'll have to pay up 10 lakhs! Trust me, sir. Why should I trust you? I'll pay you, sir. I will. Why are you asking me to guarantee-- Give it to me. I'll talk. Wait a minute, sir. Bro, he gave you his word. He'll definitely do it! Yes, bro! And I guarantee you! Bye. Hey. Are we guaranteeing each other? I'm really excited, bro! You'll pay it on time, right? And I guarantee you! Bye. 10 lakhs, brother! Hey! The 10 lakhs! We won't be able to come. He borrowed five lakhs from me. And I guarantee you! Swamiji had obliged to come home His Holiness Sukranandha hasn't gone anywhere. To perform the Putra puja, he is definitely coming home! Hail Sukranandha! Heck no! I'm not doing this! Don't be hasty, Babu! -What? -Only you can do this! Only you can pull this off! It's easy to steal in general. How will I steal disguised as a godman? They know nothing about you! I still remember clearly... The way you rocked the rampwalk in school... Do you know how well you acted? [exclaims] Cousin always talks about you! And you act very well! Hey, cousin! Those were school days! Hey! How much money do you need? [mumbles] Approximately six lakhs. Forget six lakhs. Take 10 lakhs instead! They're calling you, right? Why don't you get lost? You come back after one or two years. But send the money on time! Buddy? Think wisely. A better offer than this will never, ever come. Why is everyone waiting outside like Saravana Stores? His Holiness Sukranandha! Everyone chant Guruvae Namaha! [all] Guruvae Namaha! Guruvae Namaha! Om Guruvae Namaha! Hail Premgianandha! Hail Shilpanandha! Show me your faces! Hey, come and help me out! Please bless us! Welcome, my Holiness! That lady's face... ...is such a pretty face! Welcome! Hey, isn't that your sister-in-law? Yes, that's her. Please come inside, my Holiness! Welcome, welcome! Enter with your right foot, first. [heartily laughs] Please come in. Don't put the flowers in my mouth. May your holy feet bless this house and this land! Come, my Holiness! Please come, please! Om Premji Namaha! Om Premji Nama-- Hey, Sheela! What are you doing here? Careful, careful! Guruvae Namaha! Welcome, His Holiness! Please welcome, your Holiness! Bless me, your Holiness! Please shower me with your blessings, my Holiness! Take this, your Holiness. My hand's aching. Take this. 'I must find where all' 'the cupboards are, first!' 'I can then, settle down easily!' 'I now know the true' 'power of this disguise!' Ma'am? Look at the eyes of our Holiness! Don't you see a spark of light? 'A spark?' 'In his eyes?' And look at his face! You can see the wisdom of a sage in him! 'A sage?' 'Okay, I don't know' 'how this will end!' Hey! Why are you both dreaming? Ma'am? Can I have the honor of performing the 'Paadha puja 'on him? -Okay okay! -Here... ...present him this gift! I will, I will. Go. Pour it on me! You don't respect your own husband. Yet, you're ready to perform rituals for a stranger! What is this superstitious belief? -[chants om] -Hey! My feet are cold! Look at them pouring milk straight out of the fridge! Ask her to get up! [chants mantras] I like you both a lot! Come every day to my chamber and seek enlightenment! Hey! Isn't this a little too much? What will I do? My feet warmed up after seeing them! Ma'am? Is everything okay? Enough, stand up. My child... Make tea for all with this! Hey! Careful with the holy water! I guess it'll be easy to steal! -My Holiness! -Yeah? A gift. I don't want. Please accept this money and bless me abundantly! How did I manage to earn four lakhs in half an hour? Look at my fortune! Shall I sneak out saying I need to pee? Hey! I caught your mind voice. Tell me, my child! My Holiness... Can I ask you something? Are you questioning the Lord? Hey, come closer! You would answer the questions in school. And I'll be punished. You said no one would question and yet, this lady is! Don't worry. Do that thing we asked you to do before leaving. Okay? Ask your doubts away, my child! [chants shloka] Maha Vishnu had foretold this. Is it possible during this period? That is, my child... I can't take it anymore! My throat hurts. What is he saying? This is the language of the Gods! Not all can understand. Did anyone understand anything? I understood! -You did? -I did! What did he say? He's trying to say... Hereafter, no need to fear anything. And no virus will affect anyone. Difficult times have come to an end! Oh! People have started coming to the theatres! And the pockets of producers are filling up fast! Watch "Vikram"! It's a super hit! At the end, he speedily rotated his head thrice and clapped his hands like an auto driver. Why? -Why? -He did? Because... That was nothing. His Holiness is exhausted. So, he's asked for dinner at the mansion house! Where is this mansion house? That's our house! Oh, our house? Is our house that huge? I know, right? You are a true embodiment of God, my Holiness! A godman who knows the past, present and future! Ever since you stepped into this house, it is radiating like heaven on earth! How can my stinky feet bring light over here? Hey! Your sister-in-law took the bait! We will host a feast as you wished and turn this house into a palace, your Holiness! Bless us! Who is this now? I'm surrender! Did they forget the handcuffs? What's the point starring at me? Take me away. His Holiness! Give me your blessings. [mumbles] What is this man doing? Hey! Bless him quickly. Stay blessed! Pick up this four rupees. Damn! He scared me for sometime. Sir is my family friend. I only asked him to come. Why didn't you let me know before inviting someone? Tell me, devotee! I need to talk to you in private. Wha... Let's talk whatever it is here. Don't you get when I say I want to talk in private. Hey, that man is threatening me. Hey, no problem. We'll manage. You go. Alright, go! Go, man. -Okay, His Holiness! -Bro! Keep flower milk ready, I'll come. Sure, Your Holiness! He's talking about 'Tiger's milk'. 'I thought it was a phone,' 'but he is taking out his pistol.' His Holiness! Ahh? I'm totally dependant on you. 'Oh God!' You should only give me an answer. What answer? His Holiness! I'm not yet married. Why are you a bachelor at this young age? The reason is that I'm an honest officer. That's the reason I don't get any marriage proposal. I want to hear an answer from you about this. I'll tell. Let's assume you catch a thief. And you thrash him without knowing if he is good or bad. Do you realize what he is going through? His wife, is asking him to buy Eiffel tower, jewels, bike, and silk saree. She is asking him for a divorce if he doesn't buy all those. Unable to bear this torture, he breaks into houses. Aren't we also humans? I might have made a mistake unintentionally, Your Holiness. Is there an antidote for it? Mmmm! There is just one fix for it. Which photo did you give? The photo in which I look majestic as a police officer. Only Sarathkumar fits well in 'Gambeeram'. You do what I say. Near Egmore railway station, there is a shop named 'Shantilal Bhushan'. Go there, wear 'gupta' 'bhaijan' (kurta payjama), take a selfie and send it to the prospective brides. Some girl will get trapped in just a month. Now leave, son. You have opened my eyes, Your Holiness! 'I have insulted him and he' 'thinks I have imparted knowledge'! Here! Take the holy water. Do good to people around you. Okay, Your Holiness. Good things will come to you. Go! Leave now. Sir! His Holiness? You forgot your pistol, man. [mumbles] I now realize why you haven't got married. Keep your pistol safe. 'He's trying to' 'fill a cracked pot.' [mumbles] Your sister-in-law made me sit in one place in the name of meditation. My legs have gone numb. This damn beard... Having a shot will make me feel better. Is that beard so irritating? Hey, you will know when you wear it. The second thing is I shouldn't go back to get the slippers. His Holiness! Come in. [giggles] I have boiled five liters of milk-- For me? mixed almond and have prepared badam milk for you, Your Holiness. Ah! A healthy drink. Please drink it, Your Holiness! Drink it. Badam milk? First, you pamper the Godmen. Then give them up to the police. I'll drink, you leave. -Now leave. -Don't worry. I'll take care. You go! Get back to reality! You leave now, child. Looks like she will become part of this family soon. [clearing throat] Anakaputhur alcohol - badam milk. Lovely combination! Hey! Where's your beard? It would be lying around here. Hey, hey! It's missing. Where are you searching? Hey! -Where's the beard? -Hey! -Look at him. -Velunayagam! He looks like someone who sells camel soap in Dubai. Hey, give it. Can't you drink with this beard? It's really irritating. It's tickling me. Do you even understand the seriousness? 'Badam milk?' Would Shakthi have noticed it? -Of course! -Oh damn! Then, are we caught? We are definitely caught. 'Oh God!' Put it on properly. Alright, let me do something. I'll go and reconfirm. Both of you stay alert! Bro! Will you bring some pickle when you come back? [irritated] I will make pickle out of you. Hey! Will we get caught? Why would he get caught for getting pickle? Hey, you foolish man! Cousin, adjust my beard! It will be on your head if we get caught. Is this so important now? Why did you remove the beard? That girl is coming. Shakthi! Do you notice any change in this room? Ahh! 'God!' Mmm! -Yes, I do. -Oh damn! 'She caught us!' 'The game is over.' What changes? The frame which was always here, who shifted it to this side? Is frame the only change? Yes! Leave it. Do you notice any change in this frame? [mumbling] 'Your face looks like' 'an eyebrow pencil.' Tell me, child! I can see. We are caught - confirm. I see less light in His Holyness's eyes. 'Thank God!' 'How will you see when' 'I'm completely drunk?' -Light? -Yes! It will dim down after 6. Oh! He will attain salvation after 3. Oh! Hey! Did you bring me here just to ask this? Do you think I will call you for this? You didn't wave a proper goodbye to me. My heart really ached. I wanted to say bye! [shying away] Bye! [clears throat] -Bye! -Bye! I know that. Get me that pillow. Yes, bro! You sleep on the floor. We'll both sleep on the bed. Cousin, please get that milk from him. Here, bro. I think he has brought the pickle. Give it, bro. [indistinct quarrel] Give him nicely. [phone rings] Tell me, sir. Hey, fat rasgulla! I'm Preethi's brother. Is Preethi your sister? Yes! Own sister. Blood relation. Hey... How will your sister react if she sees you being intimate with Preethi? She would definitely throw me out of this house. Ahh! When your sister does that, she is my own sister. Mmm, after seeing her like this, what should I do as a brother? Sir, I gave you six lakhs for it. Yeah... You did give... Do something. Give me another four lakhs and round it off to 10 lakhs. If you don't have the intention to pay, just forget my sister. Sir, why are you talking like this? Preethi and I love each other sincerely. -Mmm? -[giggles] Okay! If you guarantee for four lakhs, I guarantee - for Preethi. [giggles] Then, I'll surely give it. I'm waiting! [mumbles] Four lakhs! 'Where will I go for four lakhs?' 'I have already got' 'money from sister.' 'She will start' 'suspecting if I ask again.' 'Where can I find' 'money in this house?' 'Ahh... When the Godman came,' 'didn't sister give' 'him two bundles?' 'Would it be four lakhs?' 'Two two's are four,' 'four two's are eight...' 'It should be there.' 'Let me check!' 'Sridhara...' [theme music plays] [theme music plays] [mumbles] Who's breathing sound am I hearing? 'You sinner!' [theme music plays] [humming] Excuse me! Can you stop for a minute? Will you please give that money back? Which money? The same money which you stole from the Godman's bag. I... I... Me? I saw all that you did. You better give that money back. What will happen? What is going on? Ma'am, didn't you give four lakhs to His Holiness? Yes! Your brother stole that money. I saw it. That's why his face is all red! Hey! What is this, Sridhar? What is she saying? -No... That... That's... -What? -Did you take it? -No, ma'am. I saw it's in his pocket. [mumbles] Pocket? Take it out. [giggling] Actually sister... Ram and Murali stole the money. Won't our family be shamed if it comes to light? So, I thought I will safeguard the Godman's money and give it when he leaves. Ohh! Do you think she will believe your story? Ma'am! If that was his real intention, he should have told you. [stammers] Right! I just wanted it to be a surprise. You and your surprise! Get lost. Just go. This dumb ass knows no seriousness. He will go around doing stupid things. Just don't bother. You keep it back there. Ma'am! How can I, ma'am? I'm the one asking you to put it back. You just have to place it back the same way it was taken. What's there to hesitate in this? No ma'am... I'm the one giving it, dear. You are just placing back what I'm giving. There's no problem. And why should you go around disclosing these insignificant things? Don't tell anything, just erase it from your memory. Okay? -Ma'am! -'My dear!' Ma'am! 'Oh my!' [snoring] 'My God!' Hey! [whispering] Why are you stealing? I'm not stealing. I saw you stealing. I swear I didn't steal. Don't lie! We don't like people who lie. He will feel bad. [whispering] How will I live with you? Oh God, I didn't steal. It was Sridhar who stole the money. -Did Sridhar steal? -Yes Madam asked me to keep it back. Okay! I'll keep it back. You leave. Go! Go, go! Hey! [whispering] Why are you stealing? I didn't steal. -I saw it. -I swear! It's not what you think. Hey! It was Sridhar who stole first. Sridhar? Yes! Shakthi came in to place it back. I saw that. You caught me when I was going to keep it back. Please trust me. Okay, I'll take care. You go sleep. [snoring] 'God damn!' Hey! Bro! Trust me, I didn't steal. I will tell you the whole story. Sridhar was the one who stole it. Shakthi got it from him and had come to place it back. Ram got it from her to place it back. I got that and was about to place it back. Okay? I promise I didn't steal. [snoring] Whatever I told in order has gone waste. 'Thank God!' Sister! The bride's family is coming? I have plans with my friends. What plan? You and your plans... You don't have to plan anything, I have planned it all. They are coming! You better take bath, get dressed, and be ready. My father-in-law didn't casually give me his inheritance. It's because he felt I will act responsibly. If every one of you is just let loose, this family won't be a family. There should be some discipline! So... I have decided to get my brother married. Ma'am! Who is the marriage for? My brother. [sarcastically] Him? If you get him married, he will start stealing in that house. Brother-in-law! Hey! Why are you calling me? What are you blabbering? What is this? Sharu, do you know something? -What is it? -Last night... He looted two lakh rupees from the Godman's bag. Wh... Who? My brother? Yes! Why are you accusing him? I'm not accusing him. It was your sec... secretary who told this. -Shakthi? -Yes! Did she tell you? Yes, it was her. Your mind works straight listening to all these. Why isn't it steady at other times? I'll ask her. How dares she backstabs her employer? -Ma'am! -Hey! [mumbles] [whispering] I told you not to tell anyone about the money. I don't understand. [stammers] I didn't tell you anything for you to not understand. What guts you had to talk rubbish about my brother? No, ma'am. What is it, Shakthi? What's going on? She's cooking up a rumor to insult our Sridhar. Rumor? There's no smoke without fire. Hey! What do you mean? You are all thieves, who are waiting for the right time to steal from my sister. Hey! Why are you talking like a dubbing artist? Then, did you take it? Hey! Why are you shouting? He has been caught red-handed. That's why he has this guilty face. Those are pure lies! Hey, stop it! Are there pure and impure lies? Useless fellow! Shakthi! Don't be scared of anyone. Just tell the truth. Oh my! Why is your head hung low? Hey! Does that mean my brother stole something? Are you trying to ruin a perfect family? I curse you! I employed you, knowing you are crazy... Crazy? Yeah! Me? Then, is it me? You are crazy. What are you talking, ma'am? I'm saying you are totally crazy. No! No! -That... That word... -Ma'am! Don't utter that word. Ma'am! [stammering] Stop right there. You were the one who said 'no', I will never say 'no'. Look here. I have proof to prove you are crazy. The...The... Stand there! Don't move. Just stay right there. I'll be back. [mumbles] I'll be back. Shakthi! You don't worry. You should be scared only if you have made a mistake. Do you get it? Hey! Move aside. -Why should I move -- -The day you came for interview, you brought a letter of recommendation. The doctor's letter. Read it. Shakthi, who brings this letter, has been through so many disappointments in her life, she has been affected by a peculiar mental disorder. She was being treated in my hospital for three months. Mmmm! Even when she looks calm, if you say 'no', she will turn into an animal and start attacking. So try as much to give all she asks for, take care of her like a child, and help her recover completely. This is my recommendation. Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am, there has been some confusion in this. Dr. Ilancherian surely won't have written this about me. Yes! Please trust me, ma'am. Give me just one chance. -He will never lie. -Ma'am! Let me call him and... Call, call! -Yes, ma'am. -Call, call. Talk to him. 'The number you're calling' 'is currently not reachable.' What happened? Not reachable! It isn't not reachable. He has blocked your number. -Ma'am! -No, no, no! Ma'am, give me just one chance. -Hand... -I will prove it, ma'am. Keep distance! Don't touch. Believe me! Ram! There has been some confusion. I'll surely prove I'm not crazy. -Ma'am, please! -Look here. This doesn't even look like a medical report. He has written some stupid letter about his wife. Dr. Ilancherian will never lie. Just get out of the house. -Ma'am! -Shakthi! Listen to me. You don't have to leave the house. It's enough if you prove you aren't mad. Let me see who stops you. Go inside. Hey, that's the way out. Just go inside. That's the way to go out. This is the way to go inside. Alright, go in. 'Why is he dancing' 'like traffic police?' Come, dear. Greetings, sir! Give me your hand, sir. Why? I wanted to shake hands for considering me a man to greet. Who will bother when you smell so bad? So... Who are you? I'm... your wife's relative. Who was it? Sundaram? Yeah, that's me. Oh, Sharadha was talking about you. -Is it-- -Hey, Sridhar! Sridhar! He is the groom. Greetings! He's very health conscious. Hey, Sridhar! Wait a minute. He's in a hurry. This is my daughter. Your daughter is very beautiful. She's like my wife. Hasn't she come with you? Uncle! Your specs are lovely. I want it. Give it to me. -Oh God, give it. -Thank you! My specs? Please, just give it. It will become dangerous. Specs... Oh damn, give it. Here, dear. -Specs... -She'll give it back. It is safe. I can't see properly. What will she do with the specs? Nothing will happen. -What is this, sir? -Here! Thank God! Sharu! Sharu! Look here. We'll match the horoscope of Sridhar and your daughter. We will proceed for marriage if they match. If not, my brother's son, Murali is there. We'll make him the groom. Let's hook them up. Who is it? I really like your daughter. Brother! Greetings! Welcome, brother. -How are you? -I'm fine. How is everyone else? Everyone's doing good. Where are your manners? Let them sit. Oh, yeah! Sit down, brother. Have a seat. -It's okay. -Have a seat. Is this your daughter? Yeah! Come here. Sit! Let me also sit. Child... I last saw you when you were young. Shakthi! Come here, Shakthi. Shakthi? You don't get confused. Sharadha has a secretary, her name is also Shakthi. Tell me, ma'am. She stays in this house. Shakthi! This is my brother and his daughter. Get the top floor room ready for them. Is your name also Shakthi? Yes! My name is also Shakthi. I've seen you somewhere. Yeah, even I have seen you somewhere. It's not possible. We've just relocated to the city. How would you have seen? [mumbles] I have seen somewhere. Dad! I really like that dress. Will you get it for me? Oh sure. I will buy this first thing after leaving this house. Don't ask anything until then. Brother! Get refreshed and eat. We can talk leisurely after that. Yeah, that's very important. Ma'am! Courier! Please sign here. Thank you! What? His Holiness Sukranandha? How is this possible? [mumbles] His Holiness is here. Ram? RAM! Ram! What is happening in this house? What happened? Duplicate Godman. What non-sense? When the original Godman is at home, a duplicate Godman has sent a letter informing his arrival. Read it. Did you tell anyone else about this? Do you think I'm a fool? You are very intelligent. That's why you told me. You would have told someone else if you were a fool. Brilliant! Is this how you were from your childhood? Yes! Very good. Alright, I'll handle this. You don't discuss it with anyone else. Ram! A small gift. Thank you so much for the gift. [giggles] Hey, using this disguise don't... I'm not taking advantage-- Hey, hey! What? Very important thing. Urgent. A courier has come. The original Godman is going to come. What? What are you saying? Thank God, Shakthi received this parcel. If someone else had received it, they would have informed sister-in-law and we would have landed in jail. There's no other way out. We have to execute our plan soon. We have to start the puja immediately. Hey! What puja? Hey! You need to chant mantras for it. I can only sing 'gaana'. What are you thinking? Hey! -Bro! -What? You please just start the puja. Just start the puja, we'll take care of everything else. Why do you rope me into this? Don't think too much, bro! Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Moe Yes! So be it!

Is there anything else I can do, My Holiness? [mumbles] Now we are getting somewhere! [neighs] [strange sounds] [sounds continue] Oh! Looks like he might hurt his head! What is he saying? I can usually understand the subtitles. If I can't understand this, he may be trying to say something important! Tell me, My Holiness! My Holiness! You have to explain, My Holiness! I don't understand, My Holiness! I'll tell you. My child... Yes, My Holiness! Inside this house, is a secret chamber! No one has been in that chamber! If I enter the chamber and sprinkle this holy water, the Goddess of Wealth will stay with you forever! E-E-Everyone, please leave this room! Please leave the room. I need to talk about something important! Let's all leave this room! Come! Sprinkle it well, My Holiness! [mumbles] This is the best chance we have! Don't ruin it! Understood? [chanting] Get out! [continues chant] Okay, My Holiness! -My Holiness! -My child. You are truly blessed with magical powers! Nobody knows about the chamber! Only I go there! I know that all too well! You look like'Samantha ' if you smile. Make sure'Samantha 'doesn't know! Thanks to your blessings. Shall we go to that chamber? P-Please come, My Holiness! [grunts] Someone has thrown a banana peel in my path! [chants] Om Namah Shivaya! [chants] Go, my child! [sings popular Tamil song] Please come, My Holiness! [hums] Hope I can get money, My Holiness! My child! After finishing this puja... I'll go the Himalayas to conduct a fire ritual! What do you think? [gasps] [laughs] [laughs continue] Have a look, My Holiness! [mumbles] Oh my goodness! Look at the size of this safe! You are the first person beside me to set foot in this chamber, My Holiness! Besides me the only pair of eyes to see the insides of this chamber is yours, My Holiness! [laughs] Not a thief has set foot in here! [mumbles] Who do you think I am? You are the first man of virtue to enter! [laughs] Look at this, My Holiness! If anyone sets foot in here without my knowledge the alarms around the house would start ringing! Huh? The place is surrounded by cameras to capture even the smallest movements! Am I not brilliant, My Holiness! Now that I've set foot in here everything will be cleared! As per your wish, Your Holiness! Please come in, My Holiness! Please come in! Please walk ahead, My Holiness! [laughs] Even an elephant would find it hard to break through! I've spent so much just to keep this secure! All this is controlled by an electronic system. It has an ID. Only when the right password is entered will this door open! What's the number? I'll demonstrate, have a look! -One -One -Five -Five -Seven -Seven -Nine -Nine [laughs in unison] Open! -Wow! -How was it? Another important thing. Could you please bless this so that no one else remembers the number? Bless it, My Holiness! I'll sprinkle the holy water! [mumbles] I'll make sure even you forget about it! Forget it, sesame! May your words come true! Please come in, My Holiness! After you! [mumbles] One seven... Okay! Step in, my child! Why does this look like the jail in 'Valarasu 'movie? Please come, My Holiness! What's this? Everything has a signal. Look at this! What's this electricity meter box? This is the sensor. If someone gets past this room and touches these bars, the sensor would trip the alarm! Not just that! The alarm would sound at the nearest police station. Within seconds, they will come and arrest the thief! [laughs] I've made the best security arrangements possible, My Holiness! -Wonderful! -Can you sprinkle -the holy water from here? -No! Shall we step inside to sprinkle it? That... Inside... You can sprinkle it inside, My Holiness! Enter the number and open it, then! Open it! [mumbles] Why is she using the same number everywhere? Come! Please come, My Holiness! I'm coming! This is the place the Goddess of Wealth resides! -This is the Goddess! -Huh? The Goddess of Wealth I've kept protected all along! -My Holiness -Huh? This was entrusted to me by my father-in-law! Like a genie guarding a treasure, I've been guarding this for years just to keep my family from fighting over money! Oh! I've been protecting this in hopes that my family is in a good position! Sprinkle holy water and bless us so that this wealth becomes eternal, My Holiness! Okay, my child! What is inside this? My Holiness! Any saint would get desires on seeing money! You are a great saint who has given up earthly possessions, how could you ask me this? Oh, that's not the reason! I was testing if you would blurt it out to anyone! Once you open it, I can sprinkle this holy water! Only then would the Goddess of Wealth bless you! Open it! Okay, My Holiness! Forget everything after you see it! -Okay? -Open it! It won't open this way. The password has to be keyed in here! I'll say it! -One! -It's the same! One... -Five. -Five... -Seven. -Seven... [in unison] Nine! -It's open now! - My Holiness Could you bless this number so that nobody else can remember it? Okay! Okay! -[chants] "Jolly-o-gymkhana!" People will forget it! It's open, My holiness! Look! That's it! Oh my! 'I can see the' 'collection of KGF movie.' 'I have seen a' 'tank full of water,' 'but this is the first time I'm' 'seeing a tank full of money.' Oh my God! How did you earn all these? Look at the money, My Holiness. Did you see, My Holiness! I long for this even though I see it often. No one should cast an evil eye. Sprinkle some holy water, My Holiness! [sarcastic laughter] Of course, I will splash it! Goddess of Wealth! Come to those who don't have, -soon! -Oh God! I should soon start an AC tea shop. You should be there for that. Yes, God! This 'Lakshmi 'shouldn't leave me, His Holiness! She should be with me for life. Don't worry. Okay, My Holiness! The money will be here. We will be the ones to leave it behind. Oh, thank you, My Holiness! [mumbling] Bro! Listen to me. You have rehearsed the plan thoroughly. Are you ready? Hey! I misjudged that lady to be dumb but she is very shrewd. She has set up cameras all over that locker room. If any of us enters that room, our face will show in her computer. That's the problem now. Problem? Then, won't you rob the money? You idiot! I made a commitment trusting you. Why are you doing this? Hey, shut up. Keep quiet! Bro! What? I am asking you once again. Do you remember the locker and password? I'll take care of all that. That camera is my only concern. Think about it. I will grab a shot with people at the beach. Hey, wait. I'm coming with you. Come, cousin. Hmm! [mumbles] Camera Password 'One person!' Hacker Jack! [laughs] [humming] Hi, Jack! Hi, bro! Hi! Hey, brother. We'll have our discussion later. You wait outside. Okay? Go, don't worry. Didn't I tell you? He is a busy bee! Greetings, sir. [humming] Mmm! Come in, bro! Jack! -Come, come. -How are you? It's been a while. Why have you come all of a sudden? It's urgent. I hope I didn't disturb you. Not at all, bro! An Israel client. They want to spy on Russia. So, we are having a small meeting. See! Didn't I tell you? You tell. It's simple, bro. At home... Ohh! I got it. Have you understood? I just need to hack the computer in your sister-in-law's bedroom. Right? Oh my! My goodness, how bro? See! [laughs] Hmm! [mumbles] How disgusting! Bro! He doesn't look like a hacker. He looks like a second-hand seller at Moore market. Let's go! Hey... Keep quiet! [mumbles] Milk... He is Mossad's side-kick. Just wait and watch how he pulls out an idea. Here! Plug this after dinner into your sister-in-law's computer after 9. Okay? All the problems... You'll take care? I'll take care. Thanks a lot, bro! -Okay, bro. -After her dinner... There will be no problem. I'll take care of everything. Thanks, bro! I'll help even if it is the restroom inside the bedroom. Okay, bro. After food, in sister-in-law's computer... He sounds like a shady salesman. Are you sure he can be trusted? Hey! Never book the judge by the cover! Do you understand now? Then okay! [singing popular Tamil song] ...come, come! We are here. Here! Success! Hey! Why are you giving a lighter without a cigarette? Go away! Hey, take that. [singing continues] Idiot! He is throwing it. Hey, fool! That's not a lighter, but a pen drive. What's that? You can't even understand the basic knowledge of the pen drive. How will you become a business magnate, idiot! Okay! I understand! What can be done with this? If we take this and... Hmm! ...plug it onto the computer in sister-in-law's room, that computer will crash. Do you understand? Sister-in-law's room? Yes! Brother himself hasn't ever entered sister-in-law's room. How will you get in? Then what is this 'Putra puja' for? I know! Since no one has entered that room till now, I have decided to go in disguise. Won't it just be with a fake mole like old times? That's old style. The disguise I'm going to wear, I can't identify myself. Alright, go! Cousin, listen to this Dhanush song. Let me! [yawning] God! Oh God! I'm unable to sleep with this man's tipsy blabberings. Damn! Humans work through the day. Shouldn't we get some sleep at night! Uff! What was that? Hey Sadha! Can't you just go to sleep? You drink all day and blabber all night. What a nuisance! How is the room so bright? 'I think I am caught!' 'There's no choice.' Sorry sister-in-law! 'Thank God, she is asleep.' Sadha! Why is the light so bright? The light... Where is the switch? Switch, switch... Here! Phew! 'Thank God!' 'Jack!' 'I trust you!' Sir? Hey! I raised my sister with such difficulty, taught her the art, set-up a massage parlor, and thought she will take care of me, my whole life. You look like a piglet painted white, and infiltrate her heart. Do you think I will keep mum if you take her away? Sir? I've already given the money you asked for. Yes, you gave. That's for your safety. What about my safety? How much do you want, sir? Twenty-five lakhs! [exclaims] Twenty-five lakhs! Oh, God! Look here! You can live happily with my sister if you give the money. If not, she is going to take care of me working at the massage parlor. Or won't she find another rich man like you? Hello! She might be your sister, but I love her whole-heartedly. I won't give her up for anyone. I'll be back with the money. He's agrees to anything I say! I need to go attend a wedding this afternoon. Open it, fast. When we have decided to rob, why don't we just rob it all? How will this bag be enough? Hey! I just got this bag after searching the whole house. Won't we get caught if we buy a new one now? Hey! What he says is right. How do we get out with this money? Bro! We'll be suspected if we leave the house immediately after robbing. So, we'll keep the money hidden and take it later. Do you both understand? There is no place in this house sister-in-law isn't aware of. Where will you hide it? The only place sister-in-law goes to... It's the sofa where our brother sleeps! Let's hide it behind the sofa. I have been wanting to ask. Why is your brother not entering your sister-in-law's room? Bro! That's a hopeless story. I'll tell it later. Look here! No one but us should know about this robbery. -Yes! -Okay? Come on! Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Moo! -Yes! -Not three, but four. It's been a while since I ate lollipops. [groaning] Let go! Hey you! Are you going to steal disguised as a Godman? Yes, you shell of a man! This is the house, my daughter is going to get married into. Did you think I will keep my eyes blindfold? Sir, sir! Please don't shout. Now that you saw, I'll give you one lakh. You can keep it, sir. Hey! Do you know my status and my standing? Are you trying to fool me? I will hand you over to the police. Hey, get one lakh and one rupees and leave. Hey! Are you trying to bargain when you have come disguised to rob? Sir! We will make a single payment of five lakhs with TDS. Hey, five lakhs? Hey, hey! I can't accept any of it. I have to get a 25% share of what you loot. I have marriage expenses! Sir, sir! Can you give us a discount? Ahh, ask for a discount at the prison. Sir, please! Don't get agitated. Let me discuss with my team. Hey! He looks like he can be beaten to death with a towel. Didn't I tell you? Sir, discussion is going on. Please! Bro! [deep chattering discussion] Okay? Sir! We have discussed this among the team. You are in as a partner. Meet Mr.Malinga. His hand feels empty. And, he is the cousin. Welcome! Welcome on board! We're very proud to have partnership with you. -Okay, okay. -By the by-- Hey buds! Is this girl your granddaughter? Dad! I want that chain. Oh damn! Hey, give that chain. Else you'll land in danger. Hey, get lost. [irritated] Dad, I want that chain! Hey! Why is her voice changing? Yes, yes! It's the voice now and then the whole face will change. Dad! Yes, she has a frustrated face. I want that chain. Hey! -Give that chain, please. -No! [angrily] You better give that chain. Please ask him to give. Hey, pinky! No means no! I cannot give. Get lost! -Deformed doll face! -Dad! [screaming] Oh my God! Why are you hitting your father? How dare you slap him? Bro! Look here... What dare you smack everyone? [screaming in pain] [humming in pain] Bro! This girl's teeth is as strong as a granite. Her bite was so powerful. [groans in pain] Very good! Enough! Enough! So... The original Shakthi who was treated at the mental hospital is not my Shakthi. Innocent her! She is that Shakthi! He is the one responsible for that confusion by changing the letters. Then, your daughter is... It's not what you think. Hey! Please forget the deal I made with you. You were over-acting the 'relative' part. Not at all! [shouting in agony] If something happens between-- Okay, okay! Leave my hands! Anyway sister-in-law's brother is dumb. If she get's married to him, 'mad' for each other! What? For her? Hey! The combination would be like a rat standing next to an elephant. Yes! Does my daughter look like a rat to you? Yes! Super. What 'super'? I asked for a costume like "Manidhan" but you dressed me as "Tirisolam"Shivaji. Dude, don't mind that. The costumes don't matter now. I did my job perfectly. The cameras are off. Are you ready? I'm everything ready. Come on. I need to attend Lucky Sivan wedding too! I'll wait for you outside. Did you see that dude? It's like a spice mill. It's full of money. Wow. Hey! Silent! Okay. Close the door. Come on. Dude! I thought it was just a normal room. It is very technological.

Go away. You forgot? Shilpa... How come you are here? I was just a jokester... now they are using me with the time bomb. You always made me an omelet and half boil when I'm drinking. And then you'd drink after I get wasted. I love you Shilpa, I love you. What, Shilpa? Your shoulders are very broad! What, Shilpa? You are working out? Hey! Who's Shilpa? Hey! It's you? Tell me the password. Instead, you are blabbering 'Shilpa, I love you'! You are dead now. -Put the password first. -Hey! I'm telling you I got drunk and forgot. Then why are you asking me? Hey! How hard was it to plan this! Now you are twaddling after forgetting everything? What is the password? Buddy, just let me sleep for two days. I kill you. Then you can sleep endlessly. -Think hard. -Okay, wait. Let's put something I know. HEY!!! If it went wrong, we'll go to prison. That's okay. Let's go in and have fun. No buddy! My hand is hurting. Let go. I should go to prison for trusting you. Tell me. Speak! Tell me the password. Spit it! [snores] Hey! Are you asleep? Here. Wake up. Wake up. Hey!!! My clothes are tight already! Go away.

I was planning to give it to Silpa. We'll take the cash. -Dude. -7 lakhs. -As a friend request... -8 lakhs. can I grab one gold biscuit? Hey no! Unnecessary risk. We can't?

We didn't see anything. Breaking news? Switch off the TV. Hello partner. Tell me. Where can I meet you? What's the matter? I got the money. Code accepted. Hey! Everyone act normal. Dude! I have told everyone to meditate upside down. They'll be back at least an hour later. Superb. We should finish our work. Hey... we left it there, go take it out soon. You go there and see. Buddy.

Knock them off. Oh! He's "Billa Ajith!" He's gonna shoot us! Dude! We are stealing from other people. But he is ripping off his own house. We shouldn't kill them that easily, partner! We'd go to Goa after stealing the money, book room 212 at JW Marriott to safe keep the money. And then we can send people to finish them off. What is he trying to say? Even I don't know. Only then no one will suspect us. Hey! Now everyone knows where you are going. The original room number, is not 212. 215! Hey, bonehead! You said it now. Won't we come? You are talking too much. What are you going to do? I should end you first. Bro, no brother! I'm going to the Himalayas by walk, tonight. -Please don't shoot. -Sir! No need for the gun. You can go to Goa, you can go to Bombay. We forgot! -You forgot, right? -Yes. Yes. He's not going to Goa. He's going to Pondicherry. Sir is going to Pondicherry. Not Goa. Please drop the gun, sir.

You are the root cause of everything. I should put an end to you first. You sinner! Did I raise you like my brother? I trusted you like my own son. Look at what you've become! Hey, that's a gun. Put that down first. I wasted my time waiting for you. I thought you would change all the property to my name. Instead, you are doing some puja with random godman. Now, it doesn't matter if you are dead or alive. Hey! She's not my sister-in-law. She is our mother. I don't care if my life is on the line, I won't let anything happen to her. Hey! You matchstick head! Why are you conning women? Shoot me if you have guts. You thought my Saru had no one? I'm steady. Shoot me. Go ahead. Shoot me! What is this new sentiment? Hey! Before my parents died, without trusting my brother, do you know why they gave all the responsibility to my sister-in-law? Because, she will look after us like her own kids. You fool! Who are you calling a fool? You. You listened to all of us, instead of pulling the trigger. You are the fool. Bash him in his face! Ram! Careful. Don't hit him! Hit him. Thanks, man. [theme music playing] Hand over the bag! Give the bag! What? Here! Hey! Take away the knife. Hey! Throw me the bag. Hey! Will you catch it? Toss it however you want. Here! You sinner! My money! Give me the bag! Hands off! My bag?! Bad catch! The moment you entered our house, you opened my eyes. In life, I thought only I was doing everything right. No. I don't want any of this, your Holiness. You did puthra puja for me. But through you, the divinity showed me my real kids. From on, they are my kids and assets. Not only yours Sharu, -but our assets. -Hey! Talk after taking your hands off her. You are only suspecting godmen! -Sorry. -Hey! Beard is falling down, careful! My child? Trust God alone. Not the godman. Om Namasivaya Namaha! Om Namasivaya Namaha! -Namasivaya Namaha! -Hey! Is it booze? That's holy cow's holy piss. Go on. Why is your face slimey? -You are one to talk?! -Hey! How could you be that laid-back in a fight? Welcome, dude. Buddy... for the sake of money... even we fought among ourselves. Sorry, Cousin. Here, have it. First thing, you go pay back the debt. No more gambling from now. From now, I won't even watch "Soodhu Kavvum "movie. Babu! The money here is more than you wanted. Develop your v But buddy... Don't steal from now on. Advice? Can I advice you on something? Tell me, buddy. Nobody outside is bad. Also, nobody inside is good. Rajini sir didn't say it. But, I'm saying it to you. Can I tell you why I started stealing? My wife's torment. Come, let's go. I told my wife, "ragi flour kali "is good for health. But she wants to eat chicken shawarma. She's not reading the news too! She dances, has Chinese language tattoos! I swear, that's not my name! I'll teach you rummy. -If you ask thi- -You might like it. You won't change no matter what, right? -Hey! -What? You are casting me aside? Go on then. You'll come searching for me one day. I won't be here then. I'll be in London. Bye. This is my bag! I must visit the Shiva temple and repent my sins by asking forgiveness. "Jambulingame jadadharaa!" "Jothilingamae harohara!" "Vayulingame get lost!" "Panjalingame big trouble!"
