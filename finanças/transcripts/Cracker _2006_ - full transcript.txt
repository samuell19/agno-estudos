It doesn't matter Tea? You know not as a younger man. I used to wake up every morning with a stiffy. I'm groping here for a recollective noun. An embarrassment of stiffies. But you get older. It's not age Fitz. It's whiskey in profusion and cigarettes in abundance. 1 out of 10 of 4.8 million hits on viagra. I suspect I'm not alone. - Do you still love me? - Yes. - Program reaction - No. I have no need to think about it. I love you, and I'm afraid I'll always love you. - See they're all American companies. - Do you still love me? - I think so. - I'm overwhelmed. The only time I'm certain is when you get hurt, I really feel it then. - So I have to live my life in constant pain to remind you that you love me? I'd sooner not, if that's not being too selfish. No. No. First time it happened. I blamed you Blamed you for getting older. Told myself it would never have happened if I had been fondling some young firm flesh. That was wrong You coming? No, give me a minute, will ya? and yeah how I've done. Odd you laugh the head and Why? or anyone It stinks in here. Greater Manchester police have suffered clear criticism for initial handling of the inquiry. The revelation that the victim is a young American from George Bush's home state of Texas has put the police further under... moment We've been made to look like a a complete laughing stock. It's not my fault if one of my men's an idiot, mum. I'm afraid these things get out of hand when the press get ahold of them. A man steals my ID he shows it to the police, the police let him go and then detain me. That would be laughable no matter where it happened, but when it happens at the scene of a murder the mind boggles. We've got off to a wonderful start haven't we? Will you open the boot? - What's wrong? - Coppers are here, cycle the engine> Won't it help at all a big girl Ah, this is dear Sally. - Have we met? - I'm sorry to drag him away. - What? - I said, I'd help them out. It's impossible, I'm afraid. He's going to spend some time with a granddaughter he hasn't seen in two and a half years. - I'll wait in the car. - Please Do. Best of all no caped crusader nonsense. No grabbing the moral high ground, you didn't know this man. You're doing it because you'd rather spend time with them than with your grandchild. Yes, yes. - I feel like a mistress. - I'd like one, too. Killed on the spot? Yeah. - No struggle? - No. - Well, whoever did it... - So it's a soldier, survivor, this martial arts freak, yeah? - Yeah Cubicles? - Uh, the end one was occupied. - He didn't do it. - There was somebody standing here. - Track three. - What makes you say that? - The victim walks in there's three urinals empty, you'll pick that one. You can see better from there and if somebody else walks in they don't have to walk behind your back. That's human nature. But he didn't pick that one, he picked that one because somebody was already there. - Come in and have a pee. - Huh? - Come in and have a pee. - This is Kelly. - Fitz. - Go on. - I don't really need one, sir. - Well, pretend. - Why that one? - Should I go to that one there? - No, why that one? - Don't know. - Well, you three to choose from why that one? It just fills better, boss. - Go on - So somebody's standing there. Could they be the killer? Maybe. Maybe they had a row. But then would the victim have been taken by surprise? Would the victim have died on the spot? Whoever was standing there could be the killer, but was definitely the last person to see the victim alive. - I've read all your books. - Have you? - It's refreshingly free of jargon. Refreshingly free of jargon is jargon, of course. - You'll find that things have changed. You'll be able to talk directly to a suspect, for example. - Really? - And, the station's non-smoking. - Oh. Fraid so. Dr. Fitzgerald has a theory. We won't throw all of our resources at it. It's just one line of inquiry, right? Good, okay Go on. Right, we're assuming that was somebody already there when the victim walked into the toilet. Could be the wallet thief, and he could be the killer. In which case find the wallet thief and we found the murderer. However, I suspect it wasn't the wallet thief. I suspect he was simply the last person, father killer, to see the victim alive. But he kept quiet about it. Why? Because he has something to hide? Because he just stolen a wallet. So, our job ladies and gentlemen is to find a very reluctant witness. Magic Please get in touch. We believe this is a very good likeness. If you know this man, please ring us.

I encouraged him to come over. Found him a place to live. - I just feel personally responsible for this I can't say enough how responsible I feel. - You are not responsible. - We're doing everything we can. - Like what? - We're pursuing several lines of inquiry. Oh, please I lived here for 10 years. I know what pursuing several lines of inquiry means. It means you don't have anything. - Harry! We're checking everyone who is there on the night, and everyone who knew him. A total stranger Perhaps. - A total stranger killed my son. - What makes you say that? - Because to know my son was to love him. I'm sure - You think that's just a grieving mother talking. - No, I don't. No, somebody hated your son and planned to kill him, he wouldn't do it in a toilet To kill somebody in a toilet is a spur-of-the-moment thing. I'm certain it was a total stranger.

Confirms how it's got them back in it is urging some cautions however reports from eyewitnesses I can kill from this distance. I can look into a man's eyes see his life drain out, So un-American Because Americans like to kill from 30,000 feet. - I'll shoot you. I've been in this house for hours. I got money. You kill from 30,000 feet or from ships miles out at sea. Why? Is it because if you looked into a man's eyes your humanity would stop me from killing him, hmm? Is it humanity or is it just cowardice? I got a lot of money. You're happy to kill when you're safe and sound But **** if there's any chance you get hurt, hmmm? America, land of hypocrites and cowards. No, I got a wife and kids Well.... under the circumstances, what with the lady in the shower, etc. Happiness three British Edition falafel nice husband assertion Place upon the Rocks men can be common in the Who's that man? Harry? Harry! Harry? - Is he ready? - Just about. - What's he drive? - He's always pissed. - No. - Sorry? - I don't drive him to it. He just likes getting pissed. - Hello. - Hey. - Bye. I'll uh, I'll see you later. She's holding something back - Helen. - Who are you? My name is Fitz. I'm a psychologist - There's nothing wrong with me. - Oh, if I could get a Pound every time I heard that. - Nothing whatsoever. They think you're holding something back. I went for a shower, I came back, and I found him dead. I heard nothing. I saw nothing. I can't help you. - He was married. - Could you put that out, please? - Wife and kids in New York. - It says no smoking. Poor woman the shock and grief of losing her husband tainted because he was banging you just a few minutes before he died. There's no way you'd tell her. - You married? - You know I'm married. - Yes, to... Stephen, a lawyer. - Yes. - Good lifestyle? - Yeah. - Shame to blow it all for an afternoon romp. And, no, I'm not bluffing this time. You think if you can convince them that you don't know anything they'll leave me alone and Stephen won't find out. So, - I'm going to tell your husband and then you won't have to lie anymore. - I heard nothing, I saw nothing. And your husband will say, "Why Fitz, why did she do it?" Because she was bored, Stephen, I'll say. She went to that other man, she came home, got into your bed, screwed her eyes up really tight. So she could imagine that you Stephen were the other bloke. Just to spice things up a little that's all How do you suppose he's going to react? - He might be surprised how you are, it's a bit of a turn on, you see. - You're sick. - If I had a pound for every time I heard that one, as well. - I heard nothing, I saw nothing. Sorry, did you want to speak to him first? I saw a man walking away from the house. Wrong number. She's all yours. I only saw his back. Straight brown hair. He held himself straight. Swung his arms as he walked. Well, we know he's clever. Very clever. That business with the wood pigeons, clever So we know he's young-ish. He's fit. - He's trained to kill. And, he lives in a house with French windows looking out onto a garden. Possibly. - Was he killed by the same man? - We think so. - Why? - We don't know that yet. We could offer you some help. - Counseling? - Yes. No. Thank you. You're bound to feel vulnerable, Mrs. Molloy, so I'm leaving a policeman outside your door. Wherever you go, he goes. Is that okay? - Yes, - I'll be in touch. - Yeah. Make sure she comes to no harm. Right, boss. "Granma, what big eyes you've got," said little red riding hood. "All the better to see with, my dear." "And, grandma what big teeth you've got." "All the better to eat you with." It's only till I've put the police in the right path. They won't interfere with our plans at all. I promise. Remember that picture from Abu Gharib, Fitz? The little white woman with big Iraqi man on a tight leash? Why was that picture flashed all over the world? They had dozens. So, why that one?

We are an ally of the United States because we believe in fucking this war against terrorism. - We will not yield. - Lieutenant? This witness saw the killer's face. He, he , he knows what the killer does for a living. - But, if he doesn't come forward? - We find him. - And, if you don't find him? - We will. - If you don't find him, you've got nothing. Can I tell Mrs. Molloy what we've been thinking about? - Tell her. - Right. We know he lives locally, so that's say a million people. But, we know he's been trained to kill, so he's either a soldier an ex-soldier or a martial arts man. And there are only 8,000 such people who live locally. We also know he lives in suburbia or at least a house with a garden. That takes us down to 3,000. We know that he's young, and he's strong, So, if we omit anybody over 40 the number comes down again to 1,500. Crucially, you can tell what he does for a living by the way he dresses. Uniform. confusion confusion Overalls. That again takes a number down to 300. Also, we have a witness who says that he's got short brown hair, Which cuts the number right down to 100. Mrs. Molloy there are only 100 men in the whole of Manchester who could possibly have killed your son. And we will interview every single one of them,and we will definitely catch this man. Thank you. - Well done. - Thank you, Mum Can I speak to Kenny Archer for five minutes? - So, had a bit of a do few years back. - I was the first on the scene of a road accident. A bad one. Anybody would have a bit of a do. - Well? - It is unofficial. Us, you know? Noothing written down. - You on any medication? - No. - Have you had investigations? - Yeah. There's nothing wrong with me. Nothing physical. - Still get the flashbacks? - Yeah. - Ireland? - Ulster. - Ulster. - Wanna describe them to me? - No. - I really can help. No. Belfast. Derry. You're standing there. A squaddie facing a gang of screaming women. "Go home you British bastard, go home!" They're so over-the-top. You're thinking "because I had an agenda here, one or two of these fancy me." They're flaunting themselves. I'll get one of those on her own. The one with the gypsy eyes. I'll slip her one. I've got something here for you women. Then a few weeks go by and you realize she doesn't fancy you at all. And, the hatred's absolutely genuine. That old gypsy eyes is screamin' at you again, and you're thinking, "I've got something here for you woman." It's not your dick anymore. It's a bullet. "I'll give you something to scream about, you Irish bitch." Yeah? - Empathy established. - Sorry? - Step one: Show the patient you understand. Look I've been through all this before with shrinks in the army, and they were no help either, so It's all the same with you. I think I'll leave. - Did you lose mates? - You know I lost mates. - Do you want to talk about it? I'll help you with it. We were moving up a street, and the women had been out shouting there was a sniper. Always doing that. Always trying to put the shit up us. There's me on one side, Jody and Lee on the other. An American film how they won the war for us. Some kids want sweets. - Hey. - What's your name? - My name is Kenny, what's your names? - Lisa, Monique... - I tell you what, there's a soldier over there, he's got some sweets. - Oh, okay. Thanks Kenny. Bye. Bye Kenny. And, Jordy saw pram, so he went to it. And, we always did that. Got among the kids, the sniper wouldn't shoot then. The pram was empty, so what. The sniper wouldn't know it was empty. A shot. Jordy went down. Lee got there. The cell. And I know what Lee's thinking. The pram outside an open front door. He's thinking that the people in that house are in on this. And, I know that he's gonna go through that door and I know it's gotta be booby-trapped, but he's in there before I can shout. Why? Why is that always? - I mean it's not the worst, two men there, I've seen much worse. So why is that always? - I tell you what it does to me. It's the abuse of humanity Soldier goes to the pram because he trusts the humanity of the sniper. He's not going to shoot where there's a pram. But the Sniper knows this. He fires, and he knows exactly what the soldiers mate's going to do. His anger is outraged humanity. I'll make him go straight through that door. It's the abuse of humanity, the exploitation of humanity to help. I know what you're doing. What did you think of 9/11? - What? - What did you think about 9/11? - What's that got to do with this? - Well? What did you think about it? - It was horrific. - Terrific? Horrific. Why'd did they make the Twin Towers anyway? Money. Nothing else. Just money. - Never was a target better chosen, eh? - Nah, there were cleaners there. Cooks... - Collateral Damage. - Firemen, doormen, cops... Collateral damage, that's what you're thinking. I know that's what you're thinking. - Collateral damage, I'll show them collateral damage. - No, I'm thinking it was horrific. And Bush, what do you think of Bush? People hate these countries so much, they fly planes into these buildings. Anyone else might ask themselves, "Why?" But, Bush just lashes out, and now even more people hate his country. Right? Right? There's only us two here Kenny. - Nah, come on leave please. - Are you the man we're looking for? - What? - Are you the man we're looking for? - Why would I kill? - Do you want me to answer that? - Yeah. - It'll hurt. Answer it. Thirty years of war in Northern Ireland. The sniper, the bomber, a steady drip drip drip of death all rendered totally irrelevant by 9/11. "It wasn't a war." That's what they're saying now. Compared to 9/11, Afghanistan, Iraq Northern Ireland was just a bum fight, so stop being naughty boys. Kiss and make up 'cause we've got far more important things to do nowadays Totally insignificant. So what did your mates die for? - Just say you did it. - You're on it, Kenny. Just say you did it, Kenny. Three little words: I did it. You'll feel relieved, you'll feel so relieved. I... would like to leave please. Give me five minutes, five minutes. I'll go get something. Can you give me a name, please? Nah, I've seen him since though. - Discovered what he does for a living. - What does he do? I've seen him since - Discovered what he does for a living. - Yeah - If you give me a warrant, I'll have him. - Yes! - Good. - Uh, give me a couple of hours. Take Saleh. - Anything else? - Yes, it's not just the urgency in his voice. He's only just seen him. Who's the one person in uniform he could have just seen? The copper who was chasing him. You expect me to answer that? - You expect me to answer an accusation like that? - I don't. He does. Okay, if I knew the guy why would I chase him? Have you got French windows that open onto your garden? I haven't even got a garden. I've got a backyard. Can I go? Because this guy's playing games with me. He gets off on this kind of shit. Go. Thank you. - You disappointed me. - Well. I'm sorry, but it's him. - I should have realized before but... - Thanks for everything. Thanks for everything - Look, it's heading... - You know the way out. - I should have known. I know I should have realized before. - Thanks for everything. I was a little Give me about five minutes, would ya? - This is your dad's friend who's come to see about the French videos. He never mentioned you were coming. - Did he not? - They're a good firm. Good workers. I would get it, if I were you. - Yeah, no trouble with them. - What about pigeon? - There was a pigeon, yeah. Do you three want to go outside while you wait for your tea? Go on, then. - Lovely kids. - Thanks. - Oh, the relief when you see an ash tray in the house. What are you doing? - I'm just waiting for Kenny. - I've got to get the kids tea ready and stuff. - That's okay. - No, I'm sorry, but... - I'm a psychologist. - Why are you telling me that? - Well, I can help. Does Kenny know you're here? You're thinking, "Can I trust this man?" Well, you can, I can help him. I think you better leave. This is DI Walters. I'm not available to take your call, please leave a message. He lied. Kenny Archer lied. Back to the police station, right? - The plane leaves in three hours, Fitz. If you're not back, we're going without you. - I don't want you to go without me. I don't either, because you'll never get there on your own. - Twenty-four hour flight, free booze, you won't make it alive. It's not a joke I've definitely not been in tears, but I'm telling you, I'm taking James home with or without you. You're not staying here. You miss that flight, you're not staying here. You know grandad for God's sake. You're acting like a bloody teenager. Dad, you know what, I'm tired of dad's like you, you dickhead. - I have to go. - Don't put the phone down - I really do have to go. - Don' you dare... Hello. Where are ya? Can't get the money till tomorrow. - Meet me tomorrow 12:00 noon, same place. - Nah, need it now. Wait. Wait, what? - I'm supposed to.. - Get off! It doesn't matter, you're supposed to have been there. - I want it. - Yeah? - Yeah. If I don't get it, you're dead. No, if you do get it, I'm dead. Our wallet thief is Adam Miller, 23 Page Walk. - I'm heading there now. - You're not heading there now, you're waiting for backup. - It's at my girlfriend's. - You're a smackhead, you don't have a girlfriend. - Her name's Rachel. - Nice. - So, what'd you write it on? - Paper. - Writing paper? - Yes. - Sure? A smackhead with writing paper. This I gotta see. - You can show me your fine selection of stationary. - It's in there. Go. Fuck it, let's go. Kenny does have French windows that open out to his garden. Why would he lie about that? - Found that witness, boss. He's dead. - What? - Gas explosion. - When? - 20 minutes ago - Shit! 'Scuse me. - What's the body like? Well, is it identifiable? - A copper did it. - Then, it's definitely our man. - Looks that way. - Okay, brief the firemen, and I'll be over there as soon as. - Boss. - What? I'm reading a letter and it says one of our coppers did it. Kenny? Kenny? - Chains on. What's wrong? - Go Away. - What? - Go Away. - Well, where? - Ellie, go away. - What you doin'? Kenny? Kenny? Kenny? Kenny? Kenny, where are the kids? - They're upstairs, - Bring my kids down to me right now. - No. - Kenny, bring my kids out to me right now. Are you the short straw? - Do you wanna come in? - Yeah. - Get me a bottle of vodka. - How about a nice single malt whisky? They'll smell that on your breath, of course, but I don't think it's gonna do your career any harm. - He's made a demand. - Yeah? - He wants two bottles of single malt whisky. What? - I'll go through now. I wanna see the kids and I wanna see Kenny. - Shhhh. Who is that man? Can I see the kids? "Bring my kids out to me," she says. "My kids," not "our kids" or "the kids," "my kids." Kids belong to women, Fitz. - Can I see them? - No. Please! No. So now you caught me, Fitz. You understood, yeah? - Yeah. - Which means that everything I did was perfectly understandable, right? Understandable, not justified. Understandable. See I know what she'll do. She'll run away from the shame of it all. She'll move home, change her name. That's okay. 'Cos everything I did was perfectly understandable. - You know there's a marksman there, don't you? - Yeah - You want him to shoot. - Yeah. Because if I had the guts kill myself none of this would have happened. But, I couldn't do it. 'Cos if you shoot yourself, you see, I've got a squeeze the trigger. Know the exact moment that the bullet enters the head. That's hard. Better the sudden and unexpected. The way Jordy went and the others went. - But, they won't shoot you, will they, 'cos you're a copper. - Yeah, well they'll shoot, if I shoot you. Kill him. I want to see the kids. the - Hey, now surely you can eat the rest of that for Daddy, eh? Not finished, come on. Finish it for Daddy. You alright? One last mouthful for Daddy. Come on, you can finish that. It's cold outside, it'll make you warm. How about your juice, then? Finish your juice. One big gulp. They go without me? Left you a note.
