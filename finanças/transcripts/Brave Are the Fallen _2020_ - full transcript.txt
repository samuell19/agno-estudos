- They pulled out, and sirens going like crazy, and the medic fan was right in front of me, and I don't know what made me do it, but I stepped to the side, and he was like three feet between the wall, and the van, and as I looked out, this way to get a glimpse of him as he drove past, I went like that. I don't know why, but he did the same thing as he went by, and it was like a second, but it felt like a lot longer than that to see him connect, you know, that he wanted to see us as he went past. Anyway, that was like three days, I think before he passed away. He led his crew by example, A Fireman's fireman, just a man's man. Just a great guy. Tom was one of those, in my opinion, a rare individual. He's probably in the top 5% of captains. A firefighter is a rescuer, extensively trained to fight fires that threaten life, property, and the environment, as well as rescuing people, and animals from dangerous situations. It is one of the most difficult, and heroic professions in the world. It takes a very special kind of person to put their life on the line on a daily basis, in a profession where one misstep can lead to tragedy. - I was really tired from working, and I had been doing laundry, and we had dinner, and all. I think I fell asleep on the couch for a little while, and I woke up about nine o'clock, and the TV was on, and I looked at it, and they were talking about an Orange County, fire authority captain, and they showed him being loaded onto the helicopter. - The chief came, and I think my mom, and sister were standing there. - It was the day before my sister's 18th birthday, which was just terrible timing, something that has to follow her around for the rest of her life, you know? - He left That morning, and I remember hearing him leave, and my mom would always joke that he would forget something so he'd always have to come back in, and I remember standing in the bathroom and thinking that I needed to hug him, and tell him that I love him. That's like almost an overwhelming feeling, and I didn't. I told myself I was being silly, and then I would see him later. Born Thomas Oscar Wall on August 15th, 1954 in Oceanside, California. At the age of 15, he met the love of his life. Christine Whitley from nearby Tustin High. Chris said she chose Tom, because he was such a patient guy. He was very gentle, and was always concerned about what she thought. He made her feel secure. On June 8th, 1974 they were married. - Tom's family went to the same church that I did, and I kind of watched Tom grow up, and so that's where I remember Tom, and Chris and Tom became interested at that time in each other, and were dating, and I can't remember exactly when they came to me, and wanted to, or came to, you know, my wife, and I, and asked about marrying my daughter, and we you know, gave our permission, and blessed them, you know, come take my daughter for his bride, and they had three children during the time that they were together. Firefighting is a risky career, requiring courage to face danger, and trauma stricken civilians. It requires quick thinking as well as physical, and mental strength. The number one reason most firemen pursue such a career comes of a burning desire to help, and serve others. The willingness to take that risk to save someone else on a daily basis is truly the nature of someone with a servant's heart. Tom Wall started his quest for a position in the fire service at the age of 21. After getting his fire science degree from Santa Ana college in 1974, Tom began working for the California Department of Forestry as a seasonal firefighter at Station 15 in the canyons of Orange County, where Chris would drive up to the station to visit him during his 120 hour work week. He was the only married man besides the captain. During these months, Chris became pregnant with their first son, Ian. - He was a father, obviously. He was a firefighter. I think a lot of people would describe him as a patient and stoic. - He was a kind, and gentle person. - He was someone who looked the part of an individual who could, I mean, just command a presence in the room, because of his size, and because of the way he talked with people, but he wanted to be in the background. It was, I guess those humble qualities that made people just gravitate toward him. - He would comment when we'd see some, a fire on the news, and if there were firemen hurt, he would tell me, you know, like I would never send them as a captain, I would never send my crew into that building when it looked that way. They were more important than the building, or someone else's property. - I just remember how he talked to people. It wasn't so much that it was something that was, I don't know, a signature thing that he did that I remember. He just, the way he talked with people, made them feel important, made them feel cared for, made them feel like that they were worthy, and with a number of people here that were in some ways hurt, or broken, or in needing of repair and of just, I don't know, being restored in their spirit, that was Tom's greatest service to people. He made them feel like that they were something, and it was a beautiful thing. More than half of firefighters in the U.S. are married, and finding a balance between their long work hours, and their time with their families is not an easy task, but being the child of a firefighter does have its benefits. - I remember like a few times, he would drive the firetruck to our house. - The whole neighborhood. They would come out, and climb all over the truck, and stuff like that. So it was like my dad drove a jungle gym, you know, like... - You know, all the kids would come out, and like check it out, and whenever, and I, I remember feeling like proud, you know, like my dad drives this truck, you know what I mean? Pretty cool. - I think my favorite part was probably getting up, and pretending to be the engineer, because I liked the horn, and so I would get up there, and pretend I was driving. - I just remember them being like fun, like a fun time, a happy time. - We always liked trying on their like uniform, because it was always like a lot heavier than you think it is. When you're five, it's like you fall over in it, you know? So, I don't know. You're just always happy to see him, because it's like you get like this time where they're like away, and then when they come home you're like, yay! You know, you get like really excited. A firefighter's job is one of the toughest, and most hazardous occupations there is. However, curiously thousands of brave men, and women line up every year for the chance to feel what it's like to jump into an inferno with only their courage, and training. So what kind of person does it take to be a firefighter? - It's not a good profession to try to do when you're scared. You got to keep your wits about you, - I knew he had a dangerous job, but he also didn't always, it wasn't until like, he didn't really talk about it, especially when we were young. He didn't really talk about the dangers of it necessarily, or that he was ever in eminent danger. It was always like he's helping people. - He was surrounded by people who all wanted to be safe, also. That was their job to make sure others were safe, and they did a lot of training, and he was doing good work. I didn't worry about him, I just knew he was doing his job, and he was well trained. - You know, as dangerous as the job seems, to us, when you're trained like that, and you have the equipment that we have, it mitigates the risks a lot, and it doesn't seem quite as scary. - And the last time I went to the station, I took my youngest son Joel, and he was 15, and there was another young man at church, Tim Kercheval who was about 16, I think, but Tim had not kind of the station with us. So we went over there, and you know, it's kind of fun that your dad's a fireman, and walking around in there. - I just remember it being fun, and like it was cool to like see my dad with other firefighters. You know, we've got to know some of them pretty well, and kind of became like a family friends. - To kinda sum him up, he's probably in the top 5% of captains. Maybe even a little higher. In 1980 Tom was promoted to engineer, serving at Stations 36, and 37, as well as the hazmat unit at Station 4. - I was a new firefighter. I was trying to establish my career and what career path I wanted to take. I wanted to go to medical school. That's why I transferred in with Tom, and he helped me get through that process. Even when we were busy, we were running 30/35 calls a day at the time. He always helped me, even when we made mistakes as a rookie. - Tom never seemed to forget anything. Well, you would come on the next morning, and he'd have a whole list of things on how his shift went for you, and problems that we may encounter the next day, and just trying to avert problems for everybody, which was really good. - He didn't always work at the same station. He would like move around. It was cool to see the different firehouses. Orange County has one of the most rigorous, and diverse training programs in the country. - We were fortunate enough to work for one of the best departments in the country, and in the world probably. - They got a call, and we were ready to leave anyway, I had asked, you know, alarm? And everything's going off, and so Tom's like, I gotta go, gives us a kiss goodbye, and I said, should we sneak out the front? Or he said, just go through the station now so it'll be fine, and he went over to get into the captain seat, and it was like, look at that, my husband's a fireman. You know, sometimes it hits you, you know they are, but like, that's really cool. Isn't it? Of course, not every call is life threatening. Firefighter humor is in a class of its own. Nothing bonds two people quite like laughter, especially in extreme otherwise grim circumstances. We remember the people who make us smile. Firefighters, most of the really good ones anyway, always have a good sense of humor. Tom was no different. - He had a remarkable laugh. You can hear his laugh from a mile away. - He just cared about people, made friends easily. Everyone loved the guy. - Funny, dedicated to the job. And more so dedicated to his family. - It took a lot to make him laugh. - I would say that he was kind, and he always liked a good joke, - Had a very dry sense of humor, always whispered when he's telling a joke. - You walk into the room, everybody turned around, start laughing, hey Tom, how you been? While a firefighter is depended on to be the first responder to an emergency, roughly 16% of firemen in the United States have to Moonlight with a second job in order to make ends meed. - He had like a second job. He was a firefighter, but then he was also a carpenter. So he did like kitchens, redid kitchens, and cabinetry, and stuff like that, and so he did, he always wanted it to look perfect, you know, so he just really had like an eye for that kind of thing, and he liked doing things well. - Tom was, he was a hard worker, and not only was he working at the fire department at the time, but I remember he was working off duty refinishing cabinets. He would come in every day, and he had a stain all over his hands, and he'd worked all day the day before. You never had to not, you could always count on Tom. The engine was always ready. We ever had a call, he was the first jump in. Tom was a hard worker, and he was dedicated what he did. - As a firefighter, we're there a third of our lives. So a lot of times, we spend more time at the fire station than you do at home sometimes, and when you go home you're tired, and you want to get a meal, and get some sleep, you know? Especially if we've had a particularly rough shift, and we've been up for 24 hours, or so, ready to go home, and sleep. - So he did work hazmat for a while, and I remember him coming home, and I think there was, I don't know if it was a bomb, or at like, looks like a bomb, but they had to like suit up, and go in. I forget, I think it was like at UCI, and so I remember him saying that it was like very stressful, because he only did that for like a little while. In 1994, he earned his position as Captain Wall on Engines 17, 38, and finally Engine 21. During Tom's ever changing career as a firefighter, he achieved advancements, and kept his skill levels up to date. Eventually he became an instructor for Academy 17. - He always seemed to shine when he was doing his job better than the other guys. Not trying to outdo everybody, or any particular person, just giving everything he had to get it right. A lot of guys, being a fireman is a job. Wasn't a job for Tom. - We're inside Kim's house, and then there's a neighbor ran over to Kim's, and said that their backyard was on fire. We went out to the front. Tom was in his shorts, and tee shirt, and flip flops, and saw the fire in the neighbor's backyard, ran over, jumped over the fence. I went with him. We grabbed a couple of garden hoses, and he was directing me. I never put out a fire before. I had no idea what I was doing, and he directed me where to put the water, and we knocked down the fire, and by the time the fire department got there, the fire was out, and Tom was out there with the water hose, his flip flops, and shorts, putting out the fire. - Most of the fires you have in a fire station at the, you know, you get called out on are not really big. They're, you know, handled usually by one engine, not the major fires that you see on TV, although they happen all the time. - They were at a brush fire. For whatever reason, my dad left his turncoat in the truck, in the fire engine, and I think they were just surveying stuff at the time. They were trying to figure out like where they were gonna park and actually start fighting this brush fire. The wind had changed really drastically, and the fire was then like getting blown against the side of this hill, but it was basically gonna start a burn behind the fire engine, and so he needed to move the truck real quick, and it wasn't my dad, it was another firefighter had jumped into the cab, and hit the air brake, but there was all this fire, and wind nearby, and the air brakes like sucked up fire into the cab of the truck. Basically there was a big fireball inside the cab. One of the reasons that that firefighter didn't get really burned was because he reached over, and just instinctually, and grabbed my dad's turncoat, and threw it over his head. That basically saved him. They've joked about it all the time, like it's a firehouse, and stuff like that, ribbing each other like they do. - He was very well in versed what he was doing. He'd been doing it a long time. No, he was doing what he loved. So I let him do it, and I want him to have peace of mind that I wasn't worrying about him. - That morning, we got along so well that I would go to work extra early in the morning. I would show up at like 7:00, wait for him to get out of the shower, and give him a coffee, sit down, and just BS for awhile, and then I'd go over the events of what happened the day before, and we did the same thing that morning. Wind was howling, Santa Ana winds. I was getting ready to leave, and I felt kind of uneasy, and I just turned to him, and says, you probably ought to make sure the engine's ready to go out of County, because I think you're gonna be gone by noon. And he was, I think they were dispatched about 11:00 in the morning to Riverside. I was on the engine company with Tom. It was a Tom, myself, and a firefighter, and about, I remember about 10:30, or 11:00, sometime around there we got on a strike team to Cal Mesa area for a brush fire. We got there, and fought the fire. Eventually the fire got into some structures, and at one point I wasn't really paying a whole lot of attention. I was watching the engine. Battalion chief we had at the time said kind of, keep an eye on Tom. He was over off to the side, and he said he doesn't look real good, and at that point some Riverside paramedics, and also Orange County Fire Department paramedics went over, and kind of were talking with them, and next time I looked, they had put some oxygen on Tom, and still didn't think too much about it. I went over, and said, how do you feel? And he says, you know, I feel okay. As time progressed, and I looked back again, and the medics were doing CPR on Tom. On October 5th, 1998, Captain Thomas Wall died while battling to California Taylor wildfire in Riverside County. He was working on a roof trying to save a home that had caught fire from burning embers. He had been fighting the fire for over 10 hours. When he collapsed. - My phone rang, and it was a cousin in Arizona. I go, what's up? And, and Debbie says, well, we heard a fireman was killed from Orange County, and I said, what are you talking about? I didn't even know that they had gone. I was just home doing stuff around the house. So she told me. So I turned on the news, and found out they had been dispatched to the Taylor fire in Riverside, and then they switched over with the live helicopter footage of a strike team of structure engines, and a crew working a guy doing CPR on the ground, and then the phone rang again. It was my mom, she was crying. She says, thank God you're alive, and I go, what's going on? And she says, a firemen from Orange County, and I said, Orange County? She says yeah, they said Tustin. Well the department wasn't releasing the name, they weren't notifying anybody. So I immediately jumped on my car, and drove back to the fire station, and the word was starting to come in that somebody had been killed. - I worked that night, and two firefighters died we heard on the radio. - That's probably one of the saddest days I've ever experienced in the fire service. It's devastating for not only me, for everybody, because you always think, I'll be okay. It's not gonna be a big deal. Just go out, and do the job, get it done, come back. You don't think that when you left home, that's the last time you'll see home. - I remember hearing rumors that somebody on the fire in Riverside, one of our guys had gone down. - I was at an association meeting the day that Tom and Hanson incident happened, he went on a strike team out in the Riverside area on a brush fire. - And then some more information came in, and they heard that it was, you know, one of our guys from our station, and then we heard it was Tom, and that he had had a heart attack. - I was the lucky one to answer the door. When the chaplain came. They asked, it was the chief and the chaplain, and they asked for my mom, and so I went, and got her, and then I immediately went into my little brother's room, and got him, and told him that he needed to come quick, that something happened to dad, and so we waited in the hallway, and I just remember praying that he was alive. I guess the part of me knew that he wasn't. About at 9:30, or so, there was a knock on the door, and, because we'd been working with the chief, and various people with the fire department, with Tom's firemen having died, I don't know, Meghan went to the door to look to see who it was, and she turned around, and said, it's firemen, and Joel came out in the living room, and he's like, what? Meg said, come over here with me, and I remember I walked past, and I'm like, what is going on? You know, what are you thinking? Anyway, they stayed, and Meg's told me that she said to him, wait, he's like, wait for what? She goes, y'all know, she just had this very distinctive gut feeling, and when I opened the door, it was the chief and I went, well, hi, how are you? And he looked like, you know, I'd slapped him, or something, and I said, Tom's not here. He said we know. Then it was the chaplain that I'd sat next to him at Allen's funeral, and was not putting it together at all. It just never occurred to me that something was wrong in any way. He said that Tom had had a heart attack, and I said, well where is he? And he said he did not survive it. I couldn't absorb that. I must've made some sort of moan, or something. I made a noise, and, because Meghan opened the door, and she, and Joel asked what was going on, and I told them that their dad had died, and it's just not something you ever think you're ever gonna say out loud. - As soon as my mom started crying, we opened the door, and she told us. - Just all of a sudden, like all of our family was like at our house, like pretty immediately, and a lot of people from the church that we were going to at the time. I just remember it being like this whirlwind, you know? - I was at home. I remember getting a phone call from a number I didn't recognize. I was like, why? I couldn't understand why he would be calling me, because it never happened. Like never got calls from other firefighters, to me directly. He called me, and was like, you know, this is, I worked with your dad, and I was like, didn't believe him, and I think I hung up on him, and I was like, I'm like, this guy is like trying to, this is a scam phone call, or whatever. Hung up, and called me right back. So he like gave me all the information. I was like, okay, this guy's probably who he says he is, he's like, I need your address, because I need to come pick you up, and I was like, okay. So he shows up, he comes inside, he's like, your dad's in the hospital. I need to take you to your house. Chuck told me this, the battalion chief, he said that he was really proud of Ian, how many reacted in that when he said he needed to come with him, and he's like, well, who are you, and why do I need to go with you? And he didn't want to just, he didn't want to be the one to tell him, or rather, he just wanted to get him to us, and they brought him back to the house. He was very pretty grown up. He was like the man of the house, you know, at point you wanted to take care of us. He's a sweet man, my Ian. - I was sitting out here the morning that he died, had no clue about that being the end of the day, but I was looking at the patio cover thinking that it was in pretty bad shape, had some termite issues, and I was looking at it, thinking about taking it down, and of course Tom was on my mind, because he helped me put it up. While I was sitting here looking off in that direction, I saw some smoke, which reminded me of Tom too, because of course he was a fireman. That evening I was at work, and my son called me, Darren called me, and he didn't know how to tell me any other way. He just told me that Tom died. Tom is dead. I couldn't believe it. - I remember sitting on the couch, and the TV was on. The house still packed, and it's later at night now. I looked up at the television, and the newscast was on, and it was right then is when picture of my dad's on, and the news reporters like talking about how he'd passed away, and I like lost it at that point. - I don't even think I knew like look call he was on, or what he was doing at work that day until after the fact. - Joel was only 15, but that was like I said, about 9:30, and I bet within a half an hour there were 50 people at the house. The neighbors started hearing, and bringing stuff over, and my family came over, and the department went, and picked up Tom's mom to bring him over, and there were people there all night taking care of us. - It was just a horrible loss. Just a huge, a huge hole there you couldn't fill. All of a sudden it's like bam. It's like huge life change, you know? - It's like having the floor pulled out from underneath you. Probably felt like he was just getting to know his dad, and then Meghan, it was her birthday when all of the hoopla started when she got married. You know, because honestly, that was my first thought was who's gonna walk her down the aisle, and so her brothers did. From the moment Meghan was born, Tom looked forward to the day he would walk her down the aisle, and give her away So she might experience the fulfillment that he, and Chris had found. Unfortunately, he would not be there to see that day come to fruition. - I took it pretty hard. I kind of stayed away from a few people for awhile. Thank God my wife was around, because she understood what was going on inside, and I think everybody in the station was having the same problem with it. - This could happen to any of us. I never expected it in Tom, so it even had more significance, because Tom seemed like a healthy, happy go home after work family guy, and all of a sudden he's gone. - We were the same age either. Great friends. We'd worked together for quite some time. - Every year we see reports of firemen dying, and it's kind of sanitized, because we don't know them. They're from this agency, or that agency, or they're in Wyoming, or Northern California, and then it hits you like a fist in the face. It's your friend that was killed, but for the grace of God, you could have been the one, but the fire happened when he was on it. - No one would have expected what happened that day. I think it brought a lot of us closer together. I think for me, that's what got me through it as the fact that it's not chaos. My belief is there's a reason everything happens. When you die, you don't cease to exist, you continue. It was a very sad day. It still is a sad day when I think about it. I just wish the guy was back, wish I could snap my fingers, or wake up, and this whole thing was a nightmare. - It's a huge loss, you know? To this day I'd still pick him. - Tom and I had a pact that was done years prior, that we had a captain, a really good guy that had some sage advice for us, for all firemen is, hey, makes sure you have a friend that you can count on should you pass away, because the family, they'd be, it'd be too much of an emotional event, and Tom, and I talked about it. I'd be his, he'd be mine. Never brought it up prior to that event. It probably took place seven, eight years prior to his death. On October 10th, 1998, 1,800 firefighters marched alongside his flag draped coffin to pay homage to a fallen hero, and comrade. I'll tell you right now that the day before when Crystal, and I were discussing it, I said to her, you know, there's gonna be a lot of people there, and if I start getting choked up, because I was choked up, do something, make an ugly face, or something, you know? So I got up there, and I addressed everybody, and I started a talk, and I started choking up, and I just happened to look down the front row, and there was Chris, and she just looked at me, and stuck her tongue out with a big smile. It's like, okay, we're okay, we can go with this, you know? And they got through it. - I loved him as a friend, but also admired him as a family member, because of his relationship with his wife, and especially his children. - At the funeral they shut down Tustin Avenue like main street, and everything, and there was 3,000 people there. I'd never seen that many people at a funeral that I personally attended ever in my life. There was helicopters, and like all kinds of stuff. The entire Orange County Fire Department had like a whole procession down the main street. The house that my dad helped save that like he died there, that family actually came to the funeral, and they were like super thankful, and everything like super nice people. It's important to cherish those things, people in your life, and stuff like that, because you don't know when the last time you're gonna talk to him is, you know? - My wife went to the services with me, and she was awestruck. She couldn't believe the remembrance, the celebration, how everyone stuck together, came together for Tom, and his family. - Each alarm was sounded by a bell. It called them to fight fires, and to place their lives in jeopardy for the good of their fellow man, and when the fire was out, and the alarm had been completed, it was the bell that signaled it's end. This day, we seek strong words, and symbols that give us a better understanding of our feelings when we experienced such a loss, and we use the symbols, and words to reflect the devotion of our brother Tom for his duties. The sounding of a bell, a special signal of three rings, three times each, represented the end of their duties at that they were returning to quarters, and so now on this day, Tom Wall has completed his tasks, his duties well done. He has given his best, and for our dear brother, his last alarm, he has gone home. The OCPFA president Joe Kerr once said, "Anytime you see a firefighter "sweating in the heat of battle, "anytime you see a friend working to help another, "anytime you see a virtuous act by someone "who does not want the recognition, "someone who does not hesitate to act, "someone who will help out whenever there's a need, "you see, Tom. "I believe we will see him again." - I mean, that's why fireman fight so hard to keep people alive on medical calls, because they don't want their family to suffer. Sometimes we get lucky, and oftentimes we don't. - Yeah, I mean, and being 18, I always would laugh, because I'm like, it got my teenage years were not the like carefree, you're gonna live forever. Like the immortal, like you have this idea that like nothing bad is gonna happen to you when you're 18, 19, 20. That was not my reality, I guess. - My brother was young, so my brother's the youngest, and I unfortunately, I think it like cut her relationship short. - I remember everybody tried to keep us real busy, right? And some of the women from church wanted me to go with them to a craft fair. I think it was probably in Anaheim. It's kind of like not knowing what to do with your arms, you know, you're just sort of like, I don't know what I'm doing. But I was standing on a corner of a street, and nobody was around me for a brief moment, and I remember feeling incredibly small on the Earth, and like Tom was my protective bubble, and it was like that was gone. It almost felt like right then I wouldn't have been surprised if all the gravity let loose on me, and I just floated off. - It was really hard on my mom too, because I think she ended up locking herself in her room for like three days, like wasn't eating, or anything, and I don't even think she would really talk to anybody. That was super rough, especially, because my brother, and sister were younger at the time, and I'd never gone through this before, so I didn't know what to do. Just no playbook, right? It was a rough time, but we ended up pulling through okay, I think. Tom had a special connection with those he helped. He was a walking, breathing blessing to everyone. Anybody, and everybody came before Tom. He was also a rock for fellow firefighters as he guided them through loss, and pain, walking with them as a friend throughout personal triumphs, and defeats. An ironic example of this commitment was when Tom's own firefighter Alan Donalyn had just passed away, and Tom became deeply involved as the family's liaison, and friend. Tom was there absorbing as much of the pain as possible from Alan's widow, Kara. Chris thought of Tom is a very humble man, who did not take praise, and appreciation easily. He didn't understand all the attention surrounding himself at Allen's funeral. After all, he was just doing what came naturally. - We have lost his fireman, Alan Donlon about a month earlier. Alan was a rookie for me, and when he finished his probation he had to leave. He had to go to be assigned to a station after he was done with his training, and I wanted to keep him, but I couldn't, I didn't have the positions for him, and Tom did. So Tom grabbed him, and he went to work for Tom, and he passed away in a hospital 17 days after surgery that went bad. We all took it hard. Tom took it really hard. You could see the tears in his eyes when we found out that morning that Alan had passed away, and then fast speed, 30 days later we lose Tom, and I said to the guys, I said, this firehouse has never lost anybody on a fire, and we need to remember these two guys. - This was built by the guys at the station. I believe our union helped financially, and our Padella association, it was built on duty by the guys at the station, but specifically Joe Garcia. He's since retired, but he does all the masonry stuff, and so he built the whole thing. It's got lights, we have a switch. We can turn the lights on. At night it actually really looks nice. He left a big impact on the department, and you know, I know that's why we have this is so that we don't forget that we remember the people in the families that are involved in our department, and affect us, and leaves those memories with us. - I know I said to myself at his funeral, looking at the flag, and just kind of chuckled, and said, someday I'm coming up there buddy, and then not gonna be your rookie. Make sure the coffee's hot, and make sure I have clean turnouts, and we'll be on the engine up there together, but I think all firemen think that, you know, that when we die, we're greeted by all our brothers up there as well as our family members, and then when my time comes that Tom Wall will be standing up there, with a big grin on his face, and a cup of coffee ready for me. - The last conversation I had with him was on his birthday at my aunt Kim's, and I remember him calling me, well, my mom had called me, and said, hey, come out for your dad's birthday, blah, blah, blah, and I was like, I got to do laundry, and all this stuff around the house, and I got work tomorrow, and like driving all the way out to Riverside is like this huge thing. I'm like, I'll see you next week, or whatever, right? And I didn't know it at the time, but that was gonna be the last time I talked to my dad. He called back, and asked me like, come over, or whatever and I was super stubborn. He's like, your mom will do your laundry for you, and stuff like come out, or whatever, and it was one of those things where I'm like, no, I'm not gonna like, let my parents take care of me anymore. I'm gonna do it on my own type of thing. That was the last time I got to talk to him was telling him I wasn't gonna show up to his birthday party, which sucks, but... - I remember things, and smile, you know? I don't know how to explain it. It's like in memory of an old lost friend that you all of a sudden calls you on the phone, you start talking to a few really good. And every time that I was near Tom talking to Tom, doing anything with Tom, it was always fun. Never any problems, just the guy was a joy to be around. If you were stressed, and he walked in, the stress would go away. He had that kind of charisma about him. Tom is survived by his wife, Christine, his daughter Meghan, and his sons, Ian, and Joel. He is remembered as a hero who courageously gave his life in the loving service of others. - We're supposed to grow old together. I visualize that part of our foundation under our house had been blown away, because I was a Fireman's wife though, and he was gone so much. It just, and it's sort of an unreal way, it felt like he just was on an extended, you know, assignment, or something. If you having started your own company, how do you think your dad would have reacted to that? - I think he would've loved it, because I mean he ran his own carpentry business on the side, you know, he was like finishing cabinets, and doing stuff like that on the side anyway. A lot of firefighters have side work stuff that they do anyway. So he lost his dad around the same age, and that also like changed a lot of the way I perceived things that he did, or talked about as well, because he had that experience. So looking back on it through that lens kind of changes the way you perceive those memories too, because now you have this like weird common bond that you didn't have before, but you also can't talk to them about it. So I mean we used to play like a lot of music together, and stuff like that. - And this is G right here. - My dad started playing guitar when he was like 35, like around my age now. - He like loved playing songs about having a dad growing up with your dad, or losing your father, or that type of stuff, and I played those songs with him. So it's kind of weird to think about that in hindsight. - He, you know, he wanted to be a grandpa, and stuff, and I've got two kids, and you know? I think he would be totally stoked. Joel would follow in his dad's footsteps sharing his same passion, and inspiration for music. - I think about that, like he'd probably come over with his guitar, and play with the kids, you know, and play for them. My kids like to sing too, so I think they would've had a great time. I think he would have just like really enjoyed just hanging out with them, you know? - I mean I think you would just say like try to enjoy life as much as you can. Find the good moments, and the fun moments, and clinging onto those, I guess. - I would think Tom's message to any of us would be focused around his family. He's was a strong, strong family guy who loved his family. - I think Tom, Tom would probably tell me when you get stressed, if you get down for some reason, just stop, take a big breath, look up, see the sun, and realize that tomorrow's coming. - He'd probably say, dude, you've been eating pretty good? - We lost a lot when we lost Tom. He stands out more than a lot of the others, friends that I've had, but he was going places. He was gonna do good things for people. - I do have this really weird memory, I was real little. I was like a baby. I was probably under three years old. I remember, because we lived in the house that I was born in was in Santa Ana. We had horses on the property. Like, I have a memory of him carrying me, and like watching a fowl being born, for whatever reason, I have this memory of like him standing out by the, by the pen, and watching this, this baby horse be born, weird memory. - Tom knew how to listen to people. As I said before, he knew how to make people feel important, and he had that wide smile on his face whenever he saw you, as if he had been just waiting for you to come in that door. I really try to make people feel that way when I see them. I'm sure I fall short of Tom's excellence in that, but it's something I aspire to be like at all times, and so I have. Thank you Ian. - I like it. What about you Meghan? If the camera moves, everything moves. - That's one of the things about having a camera, your hands can never move. Whenever a camera's shaky. He's taking a little nap. - They're always getting sick like this. - Yeah you know better.
