I'm Susan, the bad luck penny. I bought a million dollars worth of trouble for everybody. I reached so hard for the stars, I forgot to look where I was walking. I wonder how things would be if. And indeed is the very foundations of our civilized society. The state seeking to protect its very existence has said that murder, cold-blooded, red-handed, premeditated murder shall be punishable by death. For a life destroyed, the state will ask the full penalty, the death of scot Webster. Mr. Stokes, please take the stand. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, god? Certainly. Ah, what is your name? Tips. No, I mean your real name. Leon beecher Stokes, head bellhop at the regent hotel. Will you tell the jury what you saw on the night of August 13th? I seen plenty, but after being in the hotel business for 20 years, didn't surprise me none. Just tell us what you saw on the night of August 13th. Oh, certainly. Well, I had just took a load of ginger ale and a stack of bromides up to 810. Ah, them dames tip liberal sometimes, well, when things is good. You killed him. You killed him, that's what. Mr. Stanton was stone dead, and there was that guy with that there gun in his hands sayin' nothin', and Mr. Stanton was so liberal too. Your witness. Witness excused. The state rests. Scot Webster, take the stand. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, god? =t do. State your name. = scot Webster. Scot, the state charges that on the night of August the 13th, you shot a man to death. You're on trial for your life. Your honor, the defendant is our only witness. I beg the court and the jury to hear a full account of what he states is the truth. I ask you to begin at the beginning. Tell the court and this jury just what happened, the exact truth. Go on. About two months ago I came to town. I was looking for Larry Reed. I couldn't find him anywhere. Then I found out he was connected with a man named bruhl. The night Wade Stanton was shot, the night I was arrested for the murder, t went to see Mr. bruhl. W.s. Bruhl, please. Do you have an appointment? = just tell him scot Webster. Mr. bruhl's apartment. A Mr. Webster to see Mr. bruhl. Mr. bruhl is not in. Do you know... No, they don't khow where he is or when he will return. Say, Jim, tell Mr. Bruhl his car is waiting. Hold your ignition. Just phoned he'll be right down. Good evening, Mr. bruhl. Say, you need a shave. Yes, sir. I'm looking for Larry Reed. Mind telling me where he is? And what do you want with Larry Reed? I gotta find him. Where is he? You're very upset. That's no good. Where's Larry Reed? I tell you what you do. Do you know where the hotel regent is? The usual place. Come there tonight, room 840, say about 11 o'clock. 11, I'll be there. I'll be there. Looks like I'm not the only Thorn in your side. Ah, but you are my favorite Thorn, Wade. Listen to me, Wade. Suppose you listen, w.S. I'm tellin' ya for the last time, I'm due and I wanna be paid. You will be, sure you will be. Open the door, Wade. = t didn't shoot Wade Stanton. I never shot anybody. That gun wasn't mine. I believe you, scot. Your witness. Isn't this the gun in which you killed Wade Stanton? = no. Then how was it this instrument of murder bore the insoluble evidence of your fingerprints? Isn't it true that no such person as Larry Reed ever existed except in your imagination? = no. Why did you wanna find this imaginary Larry Reed? It was something personal. Something personal, is murder something personal? Objection. = sustained. Why did you go to the hotel regent? To find Larry Reed. = to kill him! = t would've killed him. But unfortunately for Wade Stanton, you found him instead, didn't you? = you have sworn to tell the whole truth. I must warn you. In refusing to do so, you are standing in the path of justice. Valiance, sacrifice, have no place in a court of law. = I've told the truth. I never killed anybody. You may continue. Witness dismissed. = scot! Where is she going? Scot, you've got tell him everything. You must, they'll kill you. Order, order. He's trying to protect me. I tell you, he's trying to protect Mel! Have you evidence to offer in this case? Plenty. Swear in the witness. I object, your honor. This is highly irregular and immaterial. We're not interested in technicalities here, only justice. The court is quite capable of deciding irregularity and technical procedure without bickering or further interference. The witness will permitted to testify. Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, god? I do. Stater your name. = Susan Webster. She hasn't anything to do with this, she doesn't... Sit down, sit down. What I've got to say is not a new story. I put my brother where he is now. Scot tried to stop me. T wouldn't listen. No, I was so sure, so smart. It started a little over a year ago back home. Reverend, don't forget we're having fried chicken. Fried chicken, I'll be there. Goodnight, sir. Tea, Friday, reverend, now don't forget. Thank you, miss Julia, I will. Ti mean I won't. Oh, goodnight. Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight. Hope you'll come again. There you are, Susan dear. Now you will bring a basket to the social. Last year, you know, you forgot one. I remember, it was awful. You can depend on me. Yes, thank you. I know where you can send for 10 easy lessons on how to really play the organ. Confession is good for the soul, or do I sound like reverend Russell? You've been crying in my vest pocket since you were in rompers. I'm still listening. Why can't I be like you, scot? You are. No, scot, you're different, you're happy. You've got your job at the post office, playing the organ here at church. Your life is full, secure. I know, sis, I know. Just what makes you and county fairs and church socials. Strawberry festivals and the blue ribbon for the winning cabbage crop and the town hall meetings. Look, sis, we've gone over this lots of times. I know how you feel. You've set your heart on it. I can't keep on telling you to stay here. Only I thought that with just the two of us... I'll write, everyday, I promise. I wanna go someplace, anywhere. I wanna be somebody, someplace where things are happening, I mean, important exciting things, someplace that's alive and big, not this... But what if you find the big town too big? That's what I'm thinking about. Folks are more afraid to stick it out, and less afraid to come home then. There I go preaching again. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm right. It's just I'm going crazy here. = we can't have that. Ah, skipper, you son of a gun. You can bring this old hunting hat to me a thousand times more and I'll keep right on telling you, you and me can't go hunting till fall. Your honor, I object, this is a trial for murder, not a girl's dormitory gabfest. So-called facts presented by miss Webster, if she is miss Webster. Argue irrelevant! Objection denied. You may continue. What money I had was going fast. Things weren't like I pictured them. The city was big all right. You find that out when you're looking for a job. I can't make it rain when there's a long dry spell, and I can't make jobs when there ain't no jobs, and there ain't no jobs. You back again? Yeah, it's a habit like not eating regular. Hello, no, no, no, there ain't no jobs. Oh, I'm so sorry. There ain't no jobs. There ain't no jobs. The whole thing's a plot against us. Two, heaped high and heavy on the butter. This all right? You know something? I saw a motion picture once where a nice fella and a girl went all the way through clear to the end almost, and she never told him her name. = Susan Webster. Larry Reed, how do you do? How do... I'm so happy, scot, it seems a shame the whole world can't share it with me. I wish you were here beside me. I hope you won't think we're too foolish rushing things so, but I've a new vest pocket to cry in, a wonderful, handsome, dependable vest pocket by the name of Larry Reed. For as you both have consented in wedlock, and have acknowledged it before this company, I do by virtue of the authority vested in me, now pronounce you man and wife. A little wine. Not too strong. Just a little toast for the lovely bride and the groom. Myself, I'm a total abstainer. Except naturally on occasions like this. This is wedding wine. To the newlyweds. To your health, happiness, and your future. Thank you, thank you all so much. Yeah, thanks, ah, well, we'll be going. I guess. Oh, yeah, yeah. Excuse me, sorry, I just wasn't thinking. It's all right. Don't let it upset you. It's perfectly all right. It's nothing unusual, you know. Goodbye. Goodbye, good luck to both of you. Beautiful. Aren't you gonna carry her across the threshold, Larry? Let's get down to business. Well, here she is. This is the lady. Say, I wanna kiss the groom. Oh, come on, let's get down to business. To drown bad luck, this way. I'll get him a rocking chair. Good luck. Makes my cheeks feel funny. Larry! Good morning, so the bride's awake. Larry! It's a beautiful morning and so are you. Where's Larry? Larry? Where is Larry? Now, now, don't get excited. I'll explain everything. Maybe you've been dreaming. You forgot the key. Watch that first step. It might spoil your makeup. Nice party you gave, but expensive. Can you afford it. Well, the manager's been up twice. Says you're to send him 95.40, or he'll send you where board and room is free. How about taking some good advice? There is no Larry. There never has been. There never will be. One Larry more or less shouldn't upset a pretty girl like you. You can have things just about as you want them. Especially since I happen to know where there's a good job waiting. A friend of mine. Not the highest class cabaret. Do a little drinking, a little dancing. Make the yocals happy. Get them to loosen up with some of that ah, imported stuff. A job that pays good money, and you don't have to worry about being late to school. You're a noisy little. Munn was right about that first step. It spoiled my makeup all right. All the other steps didn't matter. Scot didn't know such a person as Wade Stanton lived. How could he wanna kill him! If you're looking for the answer to who did, ask Mr. bruhl! I object, your honor. The suppositions of this lady, are not admissible evidence! In fact, she has given no evidence at all! What a fabulous story concocted out of whole cloth, and presented here in the hope of blocking justice and thus saving the life of a murderer. Objection sustained. The jury will disregard the last comment of the witness. Strike it from the record. What I told was the truth! Ti told what scot wouldn't! = the evidence stands for itself. Your witness, Mr. mcmasters. And a very excellent witness I think it will not be necessary to trouble you with too many questions. Will you kindly explain to the jury the nature of your ah, occupation, how you live. Thank you. Witness excused. The jury is charged with a grave duty, deciding whether scot Webster should continue to enjoy the privileges of freedom, or whether he should pay with his life for the life the state contends he destroyed, the life of Wade Stanton. Your honor, I consider it a sad commentary on the dignity of a court of law, that a man whose hands are red with the blood of murder, and a woman, who by her own admission, is unworthy of trust should be permitted to throw a smokescreen of false testimony, sworn lies in the eyes of this court in an effort to stay the hands of justice. Scot Webster, face the court. You have been adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree. Have you have anything to say why judgment should not be now be pronounced? Scot Webster, it is the judgment of this court that for the crime of murder in the first degree of what you have been convicted by the verdict of a jury, you scot Webster be delivered by the sheriff of this county into the custody of the warden of the state prison, and there by said warden, you shall be executed, and may god have mercy on your soul. Court's adjourned. =t don't know how. Ti don't know where. I don't know when, but somewhere, somehow, you'll get yours. And you. All of you! = t wish I knew the answer too. Maybe they'll print what I wrote. Scot wouldn't kill anybody. He didn't do it, he didn't! = t believe that. You did all you could. Why don't you go home? Home? I can guarantee the coffee at o'Grady's. All you can pour down for a nickel. Scot, scot, can I talk with you? = sure. Sure, warden. Scot, this is Dr. parry. Dr. parry wants to talk to you to ask a favor. It's not an unusual request in here, but I must tell you, it's my duty. You can say yes or no just as you choose. The world is full of questions which will never be answered. Don't try too hard. As the warden told you, I have a favor to ask. I am a doctor, a scientist they call me. The lone experiment that I am hoping to complete, I need the brain of a man, a strong healthy brain. Believe me, your help could be of infinite importance to the human race. = the human race. I owe it a lot, don't I? But don't you understand? It's mistakes of the human race we're trying to correct. You want my brain after I'm dead? Yes. Help yourself, mister, help yourself! On my part, I'm gonna be glad when that guy's dead. Every time I burn a match for it, it burns me. = t wanna see Mr. bruhl. Got an appointment? Please, I've got to see him. Come in, miss Webster, please. = the star witness. In two hours he's going to die. I'm sorry, I know how you feel, believe me. Please, he can't die, he can't. You won't let him. Say you won't let him. I? I've tried everything, seen everybody. Nobody will do anything. I'll say you've tried everything, you and your Sam Daniels, but mainly you've tried to involve me. Do you think I'm a fool? = please. Listen, lady, this is no parole board. Why don't you get smart? It's too bad about your brother, but... He just got in the way, that's all. Yeah, like Wade Stanton. Shut up, all of you. You can go how. Munn, let Mr. Daniels in. So nice of you to call, Mr. Daniels. I tried to keep her from coming here, bruhl. I know you and your kind. You never budge unless a bullet's prodding you. J la di, dah dah dah, without you j My my, the world is full of trouble. = yeah. = pulse? Normal, took his anesthetic like a gentleman. Ready? He should be proud when he wakes up with a human brain. This night's gleaming will step him up a million years in the pattern of evolution. Gregory, look, the human brain. Even more than the human heart is god's greatest handy-work. Millions and millions of cells, and each separate cell a treasure house which has guarded its own store of human passions, wit and wisdom, sin and repentance, envy, hatred, greed, and love. Yes, but the ape. Will he know of it? When he gives us the answer to that question, we shall have a new chapter in scientific history. By the second day, no new marked developments. Look at the expression in the eyes, Gregory. There's almost a human understanding. Isn't this gun with which you killed Wade Stanton? That gun wasn't mine. Get them loosen up on some of that ah, imported stuff. And you, all of you! But they'll kill you! The dead body of Mr. Wade Stanton. I never killed anybody. I've seen plenty. Murder is something personal! You killed him! I never killed anybody. He's trying to protect me! Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program to bring you the tragic news of the sudden death of j. Stanley mcmasters, distinguished prosecuting attorney. Mr. mcmasters body was discovered an hour ago in his home. The police are convinced that the eminent district attorney's death is a case of ruthless murder, but as yet, there's no clue to the method of death or the identity of the assassin. Mcmasters was outstanding as a fearless champion of the law, and is known to have made many enemies in his years as district attorney. Keep tuned to this station for further details concerning the sensational murder. I liked mcmasters, but he did make many enemies. = yeah. Enemies are so unnecessary. He said mcmasters would get his. He said we all would. Stop that fool talk, Webster's dead. Sure, so is mcmasters. Give it to us, doc. What killed him? Don't ask me to do your job, captain. All I can tell you is the man's dead. Well, I've been suspecting that for over an hour. No bruises, no abrasions, but practically every bone in his body is broken. How'd it happen? I find them dead, that's my job. You find out how they got that way. Good night! There's one doctor that couldn't give me aspirin. Okay, boys, you can go in now. All right, you boys get in close there with the corpus delicti just so the chief will know you were here. = I'm tired of murders. I wish people would behave for awhile. That'd put you out of a job, lieutenant. Hmm, we'll all be out of a job if we don't find out who won this argument with mcmasters, especially the way the papers are helping us out. A crusading district attorney doesn't get murdered mysteriously everyday. Now, let me see. He was thrown out that window. Then he was brought back up here. That's how all his bones got broken. You heard what Dr. knight said? No marks on the body. A 10 story fall might bruise a fella here and there. Ah. This is no ordinary job. Is the Webster girl still at Sam Daniels house? = she's established there for life. Go on, get her, bring her here. We haven't seen enough of the lady recently. Now you're talkin'. Do you need any help, munn? Since when, I'll be back. According to Dr. knight of the coroner's office. I know how many bones he had broke. The body of the victim had been crushed into a... Shut up, Larry. Keep it clear here! You don't want that, Charlie. Ah, Sam, have a heart. Yeah, give me. I brought you and aunt della nothing but trouble. = start that and I'll... And I'll hold you while he does it. You're at home here, just the same as we are. All right, say it. = the man's dead. Someday when I get plenty of time, I'm gonna get a live man for you. Practically every bone in his body is broken, goodnight. What about the girl? = what about her? Ah, no girl could break a man to pieces like that. No, well, whoever done it, she's back of it. Here they come, law and order. Start talking truth. It'll go easy with you, sister. I told you before, the name's miss Webster. All right, I remember the lady's name. Two men got killed tonight. You hated both of them, didn't you? You're glad they're dead, ain't ya? Yes, hmm, you killed them. Who did it for ya, how? Now you listen to me, blue britches. That child didn't kill nobody. Just because some tramp made himself a nuisance by getting himself murdered on our property is no reason why you should make yourself a nuisance. Unless you're looking for the same results. You've got nothing on her, captain. Don't try covering up for the homicide squad at her expense. Oh, the homicide squad knows what it's doing. Sure, it does. Miss Webster will be here anytime you wanna talk to her. All right, Sam, but if another dead man shows up, don't blame it on us. Okay. Come on, lieutenant. Goodnight, captain. For the second time in a single night, the mangle murderer has struck and killed in that same mysterious crushing manner that brought death to district attorney j. Stanley mcmasters earlier today. As yet not a single clue has been discovered by the police. It has been impossible to identify the latest victim other than the name munn found on articles in the pockets of the dead man. The last thing he said was I'll be back. You have nothing to worry about. Just a little social call, that's all. Don't worry, you're welcome here. You talk when you're ready. = t don't know. Ti don't know who killed him. We're not concerned about mcmasters dying or munn either. It's just that we don't Cherish the idea of meeting up with the same accident. Very well, have it your own way, lady. Who is it? Why don't you tell him? It's Sam Daniels! No, no! = who is it? = t don't know! Ti don't know. = you know who it is. You know who it is. It's him. He said someday you'll get yours. He said we all would. You, you, you! You've had too much on your mind, sleeper. Nobody's hurt you. I don't wanna get mangled! I don't wanna get mangled! I'd rather rot in jail. = leave all this to me. Go on, get some sleep, go home. = come on. I'll take care of you. Thanks. Thanks. I'll take good care of you. I hate to see sleeper worry so. Worry is bad for a man, shortens his life. = what he needs is rest. Hurry back, we'll be waiting. Everybody in the house is... Police, give me the police. Give me the police! Surround the whole place. Nobody leaves till I say so, come on, fellas. Hi, mister, police misbehaving tonight? Waitin' for somebody, bloodhound? Well, captain. All ya gotta say is they're dead, both of them. Practically every bone in everybody is broken. = number two there was shot two times. Not that it matters. A good honest murder. = thank heavens. = those bullets killed a dead man. Hey, how do you know that guy was dead when he was killed? Yes, how do you know that guy was dead when he was killed? There's no blood where the bullets entered the body. That means the heart had already stopped and circulation ceased. The mangle murderer has killed again bringing sudden, unknown, and horrible death to two new victims known to the police as sleeper and Deacon. Already four men have lost their lives in a strange and terrible manner. The mystery of which adds to its terror for all of us. Who will be next? Who will be next? Ti can answer that! Just about what are you up to? Good evening, officer. I'm about to do something for you, something you could never do for yourself. Now ain't you decent. Hey, what is this? Tomorrow you'll be promoted, a hero. For tonight I'll shall tell you the identity of the mangle murderer. You're looking for an ape with a human brain. When you've found him, there will be an end to the mangle killings. No you don't. You and me are gonna talk this over with the chief. Skipper, skipper! We are waiting for it. Waiting for your mangle murderer! But you're going first. You wanted to keep your mouth shut, didn't you, didn't you? I'm going to help you do that. I'm going to help you keep it shut always! Nobody could get in w.S. Bruhl's way, nobody. Something's in your way now. Something you can't stop. I can't stop! T wouldn't if I could! It didn't matter what you did to me. I didn't count, but you killed scot. Made him die a hundred times! Waiting, waiting in that cell! Now you're waiting. Now you're waiting. Now you're waiting! Susan, Susan! Mr. bruhl, Mr. bruhl, open the door! Break it down.
