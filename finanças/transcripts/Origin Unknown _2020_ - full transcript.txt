UNSOURCED Thank you. Welcome, sir. Move, man! Move, asshole! WHY SO HAPPY? How could I not be happy? Our Pedro is leaving the cartel, man. My brother, well, not my brother, your brother! PEDRO IS NOT YOUR BROTHER Calm down, man! Relax. DON'T SAY TOO MUCH What? Say too much? Me? I didn't get my tongue cut off. You're a goddamn crook, man. Take good care of it, it's as good as new. Come on, man! Take your hat off! Come on. Looks are everything. What up, Pedro? Your brothers are here, dude! How are you, man? Getting by, man. Getting by. What about you, Eric? Have you learned sign language? Well, thank you for coming to support me, I really appreciate it. Come in, come in. We'll show you the logistics. -This way. -Just like that? No tequila? Later. Domestic employees spend the night in town. Only security agents stay. The Commander and his men are in charge of the house perimeter. You two: inside with me. Only my family can go to the second floor. Okay? Sir, if I may, can we place some more agents inside? These two are like little brothers to me. Even though we were apart for some time, I've known them since they were kids. This guy used to talk nonstop! -Hey! -I trust them, Commander. I'm telling you, man, you always hold a grudge. -I'm sick of this guy. -Gentlemen. Inside, channel 3. What? So you are number one? Come on, let's get inside. -Commander, keep us informed. -Yes, sir. This dude, what does he want a radio for? He can't talk! That's two, asshole. Shit! How does this thing work, Pedro? The system detects my presence. I activate it with a visual code. Once it's operational, anyone can manipulate it. I can't believe it, man! Well, I'm leaving. -Don't fall asleep. -Okay. Hey, Pedro! What about the money? What should I tell H? Not yet. I'm waiting for some transfers, but soon. You're taking a big risk, man. H accepted your exit, man. Twenty million dollars are nothing to you. Hey, Pedro! Listen to me. You're being crafty. Think about your family. Of course I think of them. They're here in case something happens before the payment's done. This house is a fortress. Just relax, man. Don't get mad at me. I did what I could, I talked to H, so... the rest is up to you. Think about it, brother. Don't fall asleep. I want you to be alert. Okay, relax. Have some rest. Are you from the other side? I'm looking for someone who's dead. María del Carmen. Mom. Are you there? Manifest yourself. Manifest yourself. Manifest yourself. Mom! Mom, is that you? "S..." "H..." "SHE..." "SHESCOM..." "IN..." "G." "She's..." "...coming." What are you doing up? Francisca, you scared me. What are you doing? Remember when I gave it to you I told you there were rules? You need to place silver on top to keep evil spirits out, and... And... they'll enter their bedroom? Never use it on your own, honey. Oh, that. -But, look! -Let me see. This is what Mom wrote! "She's coming." It has to be that! My sister said many things when she was sick. But you told me that when she was about to die she had a connection with the afterlife. That's why she was seeing things! Well, my sister and I believe in the spiritual world, and... But you need to understand, don't... Don't make this the center of your life, okay? There's a lot we don't understand about each message and about that world. Then you don't believe it's true? I want it to be true. Everything's possible. Won't you give me a kiss? What's with the long face? Okay, tell me. What happened? She snitched on me, didn't she? Is something wrong? You can tell me. -Dad! -Relax. I just want us to talk. You know what? I just want to share with you. But if you don't want to, that's it, I don't want to know. Of course. You don't want to know to spare yourself the trouble. As always. Fine, tell me, then. What is your problem? My mom's sister hooked up with my dad... -That's not... -...my aunt wants to be my mom and my dad mourned for five minutes! That's my problem! It was many years. Many years! You probably were with Francis before Mom died and you cheated on her many times! Don't even try, I changed the password. What a hypocrite! What happened? Nothing. Why? When you hit the punching bag like that I know you have problems. I don't know yet, Francis. There's something that I don't like. The transfer was supposed to be tonight, but... But after that this is over, right? Supposedly. Alan told me Héctor Guillén himself asked him for the money and that he would let us out. Just like that. If this is so... we'll leave everything behind: cartel, dealers, my father's life, everything. But let's not claim victory yet. Not yet. The Guillén cartel keeps on building up its territory. Infamous hitman Héctor Guillén, a.k.a. "H," has begun a new extremely violent turf war. Viewer discretion is advised. This is what happens when you betray the Guillén family. HÉCTOR GUILLÉN, "H," IS BACK Don't worry. I spent a fortune to fortify this house against those sons of... What took you so long? Beto wasn't asleep yet, so I read a story to him. And I fell asleep. I'm sorry. What about you? Are you going to bed now? No way. I won't be able to sleep a wink. Then don't. You two, to the front! You two, to the back! Possible 13, south entrance. Exterior gate. Requesting backup. Go get María. Take her to Beto's room and wait for me there. María! Who's there? Identify yourself! Commander, I've got the 13. Beto! Come here, honey. Everything will be okay. Alan, what do we have inside? Nothing here, man. Commander, report. We have the 13. A girl by the exterior south gate. -A girl? -Over. Is it my daughter? I don't know, sir. Over. Beto, wait here. Don't move, I'm going to check. What are you doing here? I told you not to move. What is that? I don't know. Are those fireflies? No. Those are not fireflies. She was by the south gate, sir. She was outside. She doesn't speak. What's your name? What are you doing here? What's with this girl? I'm sorry, kid, you can't stay here. -Take her. -What? She's just a girl. -Where do we take her? -Wherever you want, man. Take her to the police, to a church, or leave her at a hospital, -but do it now. -Pedro! Who's that girl? She was by the south gate. Get in, please. "She's coming." We saw lights. Something was approaching the house from there. Was it you? What is that? We have a 99. We have a 99. Southeast area. -Guillén? -Can't be him, it's too early. Get in! Everyone on this flank, take cover! North and east facades, watch out for 14! -Watch the perimeter! -You heard him! Get in! What, man? No, what, man? -Come. -Let's go! Fire at will! Fire! Come on, man! Hang in there! Close the doors! Pedro! -It's okay, man. I'm here. -Francis! Francis. -It's okay. -Commander, report. Commander. Commander! Come in! Shit! Arrows? They're merciless with your mouth! Damn! Can anyone hear me outside? It's not that serious, man. It's not that serious. Everything will be okay. Come on, Erik! Look, man! Look me in the eyes! Look me in the eyes, moron! You are going to take care of your daughter! Shit! -Damn! -You'll be okay. He needs a doctor! -He needs a doctor or he'll die! -Hey, Beto! -He's going to die! -Shut up, Beto! Alan. He's right. We need to call an ambulance and the police. How the hell are you going to explain all this mess, man? -I'm a businessman. -Businessman? Your family may believe that. There's a mess outside. Many hitmen! Maybe Guillén's! How will you explain that to the police? Why Guillén? We're negotiating. Negotiating? Fuck you! We'll end up in jail! -Maximum security! -Enough! Be quiet. First we need to be sure what is going on. Find the Commander. Commander, where are you? Commander, come in! Where the hell are you! Commander? One, come in! Commander, come in, damn it! He's not answering his phone, either. Commander, goddammit! Answer number 3! What's your name? What are you doing here? I'm not going to hurt you. Are you ill? You don't feel well? It's okay. You will be safe in here. Where's María? She was locked up in her bedroom. She wouldn't open the door. Your call will be transferred... -She's not picking up? -No. Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Don't worry. We'll take care of you and you'll be okay. Can we talk? I'll be right back, brother. None of us is a doctor. If we don't get help, he's going to die. I know, Ms. Paca. I need to know that you can focus on those who will survive. Your brother... He has a family, right? A daughter. A gorgeous girl. Meche. Well... Make sure that she still has an uncle. Just like I need to make sure that my kids are okay. They are mine since my sister died. Okay. We're going to make it, okay? Thank you, Ms. Paca. How are you holding up, man? You're okay, right? You remind me of my daughter when she was younger. She always wanted to do everything on her own. And even though she was able to do everything on her own, she knew that she could always count on me. Come here. Arrows and swords. Damn! Who the hell are these people? Pedro. Those guys are trying to get in. I don't think they can. This is a very good security system. The house is a bunker. Are you sure they can't see us from outside? It's like a Gesell chamber. That's why they can't see us. It's like an interrogation room. Take her with Beto. Come on. What's up, man? What's this, man? "Bad girl"? Hi. I'm Beto. Blood. Look. My dad's name is Pedro. He's with Alan. The guy on the floor is Erik, his brother. And this is my aunt Francis. Nice to meet you. What's your name? Lina. Nice to meet you, Lina. What if we go to the bathroom and I help you wash up? Will you come with me? Come on. Ms. Paca... wait a second, will you? Hey, relax! She's just a girl! Just a girl? And where the hell did she come from? "Bad girl." Erik doesn't trust her. Erik is good at judging character. Alan, take it easy, man. How could she be bad? He's dead. Goddamned crazy kid! Hey, Erik! Erik, come on, man! Erik, man? Hey! Erik, brother! Erik, come on, man! Brother! Come on, man! Sons of bitches! Sons of bitches! You'll pay for this, you assholes! Erik's gone, man! Alan, I'm sorry. But we need to be strong. Okay, man. Give me the gun, will you? No. Give me the gun, man. Are you going to be fine? Can I trust you? You know you can, brother. These are not the usual hitmen. Why do they have swords? It makes no sense. They're here for me. Run! It's okay, everything will be okay. Come with me. -Where are you going? -I'm taking her to the bathroom. I want to clean her up a little and then I'll take her to the gym. I don't want her to be here. What are you doing? I won't leave Erik lying here. Come on, man, help me. This guy's heavy. Give me a break. See you, brother. Look, Pedro, I know you hate guns, but... you have no choice right now. Besides, it's Erik's. Let's go. Come on in. Come, honey. Are you cold? Here. Put this on, meanwhile. Don't be scared. It's a protection ritual. -Isn't that right, Francis? -Right. Do you live nearby? You can talk to me, really. I just want to help you. To know more about you. Where do you come from? Where do you live? I used to live nearby. I hadn't been living there for long. Where did you live before that? In an orphanage. Huh? Were you adopted? Did they treat you well? Did you love them? They tried to cure me. I'm sick, too. Too? Do you mean me? I was born like this. In fact, I can't be cured. I... I have cancer. Nothing. Alan, what are you doing? Put that gun down. Don't move, Pedro. Alan, you're not going to shoot. -Put that down. -Don't move! -Alan, give me that gun. -Don't move, man! Armor piercing bullets, asshole! Don't worry. I promise your dad will be fine, son. One ninja down, Pedro. I told you not to move. Are you okay? What's wrong with you? Are you running a fever? What's wrong? Are you hungry? Wait a minute and I'll get you something. There's no food in here. Just wait until things calm down, please. Breathe, breathe. If I don't eat, I will die. Is there something else, besides cancer? -Answer me, please? What is it? -What's going on? I don't know, but she said she was hungry. -I'll get her something. -Don't leave me! Beto, please, I have to go upstairs! Stay with her. SHE'S COMING "She's coming." You'll get better, you'll see. Much better. Sleep. Don't be... afraid. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. When I was younger, my mom got sick. Cancer, too. I'd like to get my Ouija board and ask her if you are the one who's going to help me. But how could you help me if you are so sick? The last time that I saw her at the hospital she told me one day a girl would help me. And that she would heal me. Are you awake? The girl! -She's sick. -Not sick. Demon! I can't hear you. Are we... alone? Don't worry. Francis went upstairs for food. She'll be right back. Wait, what are you doing? Honey! Honey! Are you okay? Are you okay? Let her go. Let her go. It's just... the corpse... Wash yourself first. She's not going anywhere. We're in a lockdown. -How did he get in? -I don't know. He must have gotten in before. But it's okay, there's no one in the house. María? She wasn't there. We didn't find her. -What happened? -It's okay, son! It's okay. He was the only one inside. Are you okay? You see, Pedro? You're a pretty good shooter for someone who doesn't like guns. He said she was here for her. That she was not just a child. She probably witnessed something they did. If they're not with the Guilléns, I want to know right now. Call them. Poor María. She must be really scared. I'll try to call her again. Straight to voicemail. It's ringing. -Where is it? -There, I think. Maybe she left her cellphone but she's inside, man. They're blinding us. There! María! That's María. Open the door for her! What are you doing, man? Dad! Dad! -Why did you do that? -Hey, calm down! Open the door! You two, calm down! Am I the only one who can think? Dad, open the door, please! Dad! -María! María! Don't yell! -Open the door! Open the door! We can't. -Let go of me! -My daughter! Let go of me! I need to speak to the master of this house! What do you want? Who sent you? Do you work for the Guilléns? Guards outside are dead. You are alone with just one guard. Wife and small children. There's no way you can defend yourself. We want the girl. They're not with the Guilléns. The girl. We won't hurt your daughter. Just give us our girl. We'll give you yours. It is fair. Look at the camera. Dad! Please, Dad! -Open the door! -No! -María is outside! Please! -Dad! Open the door! -Open the door! -This is bigger than you. -It's bigger than all of us. -Please! Dad, please! Dad! Please open the door! Dad! -Sir! -Dad! Dad! Don't hurt her! Why are you doing this? Why? We are Arcanes. Warriors from around the world. We train for this since we are very young. We give up our lives for this. Arcanes never stop! We want girl! She's inside the house, but I don't know where, exactly. She can't go out, everything is closed. Open doors. We'll look for her. How do we know you're not going to hurt us all? Open the door... or she dies! If I open the doors, your girl will escape! I need to shut the whole system off to open the doors. You're making him angry. Open the door, please! If your girl runs away, you will have to chase her through the fields and you may not find her! Dad, we can't. We can't! You will have to trust me. If you're lying... all of you will die! You will all have to trust me. You have ten minutes. I don't want any trouble. Your father gives us girl... everything's over. Arcanes! Francis. Take Beto downstairs. Lock yourselves up. If you see the girl, let me know. Alan, help me find her. Are you giving her up? Are you giving them Lina? They will hurt her! Come with me. We'll start downstairs. We'll be moving up. I'd never seen hitmen like those, brother. Something's not right, Pedro. This blood is not okay. Leukemia. Sleep. Don't... ...be... ...afraid. Sleep. Sleep. Don't be afraid. There's no one here, asshole. We only have eight minutes left, Pedro. -We need to find her. -Find her? Come on. Alan. Do you know what this is? Do you know what's written here? "Bad girl." My brother's last words. I told you to take that girl away, but you wouldn't listen. Alan, this isn't the right time. Then, when? What were you thinking, Pedro? That H was going to say, "No problem, man." "You can get out?" For Christ's sake, man! You know very well that there are only two ways to leave this business. One is giving them a truckload of money. The other one is filled with lead, man. You've know that since you were a kid, since your dad was the boss. This isn't the time! The Guilléns are not the problem, you asshole. We're splitting up. You go downstairs, I'll go upstairs. We already split up, boss. Split, moron. Do you like it? I want to be like you. It's time to go to bed. Tomorrow you'll take the next step. Why not now? You're still too young. Our way of life has its rules and its hardships. But eventually you'll get to enjoy it. Enjoy it? Not where we come from. Lina? Are you in there? You know my family and I meant you no harm. Lina? I don't know how, but we're going to help you. We'll get over this together. Are you sure she is your chosen one? The first one of your progeny? Good. Family is the most important thing. You won't become one of us until you've fed on live blood. Tristan? Brandusa? Show yourself, demon. Lina? Lina? Are you in here? Lina? If you're here, I need you to help me. Please, leave me. Leave me and this family. I didn't do anything. You are! I'm just a child! You're not a child, Strigoi. The Lord is light, I will fear no evil. Someone opened the doors. They have María, they said ten minutes. I need to help your dad. My mom left me, don't leave me too! Please. Alan. What are you doing here? The goddamn ninjas are inside the house, Pedro. We have nothing to negotiate with. I'm not giving up. Beto, I would give anything for you and María to be my children. For you to think of me as your mom. For you to understand that everything I do, I do for you. Don't... Don't go. Family is the most important thing. Without your family, you lose... You lose your source. You lose who you are. It is very important that you know that, honey. One day you'll be able to take care of your family, to protect them. Like my sister did and... like your dad is doing. Like I have to do now. Beto. I love you. For me, you are my son. I'll be right back. Why the hell didn't you make the transfer? How do you know that? It was you. Shit. Never mind. I need to save María. I need to find Lina. Lina? Come on, Pedro! That stupid girl isn't here anymore. She probably escaped when you opened the door to rescue your daughter. You got us all killed, Pedro. You are dead. I am dead. Your children, your family, they're all dead! Dead, you asshole! We don't have time for your resentment! Resentment, man? You never wondered what would happen to Erik and me when you were out? You never thought that H might eliminate us because we were always loyal to you? Some things... Some things are more important. Sure, man. You... your family and your problems have always been the only thing that matters, right? Didn't you use to say that Erik and I were your family? Shoot, man! I told you, man. You and I are both dead. I don't mind dying either. But I won't leave my family helpless because of a resentful piece of shit like you. You goddamned arrogant clown. You'll get your transfer later, you asshole. The girl! I don't know! Leave me alone! The girl. María? María! María! María! María! María! She can't hear you. María! -Quiet. -María! The girl! Alan. Why is everything open? Was it you? Tell me, was it you? I'm talking to you! Was it you, yes or no? -Didn't you hear the screaming? -I did. Maybe that was María, right? Please don't hurt me. Don't move! Dad! Stay away from my son! You said that you were sick, that you had cancer! -What are you? -Arcanes! You were supposed to help me! My mom told me! The Ouija board told me! Are you a monster? What are you? Luca! Brandusa! Arcanes! María! María! María! Francis, help me! Francis? Let her go! Time's up. I want the girl! Don't hurt her! I want the girl first. Or I'll slit her throat. They are merciless! They are soulless! I have to exterminate her. -Take me instead. -Step back. -You won't hurt her. -Don't come any closer! Don't touch her. Run! No! Francis! Francis! Please! Don't... Don't die, Francis! Not you too! Francis. Not again! Go to Beto's room! Lock up in there! And don't come out until I go get you. Beto, do it. Beto, do it! I hope you'll find your sister, wherever she is. Nice to meet you. I'm the master of the house. -You're coming with me, Beto. -No. What's wrong with you? That's enough, girl! I hate guns. I'm not going to hurt you. Ever. Beto. Let's go. That asshole is mine! Goddamn ninjas! Dad! Dad, Beto! Come on. Let's go. Goddamn ninjas, where are you? You're not escaping, damn Pedro. You're going to pay, you son of a bitch! You're screwed, Pedro. You and those goddamn kids! -What are you doing, Alan? -The money, asshole! -The money, or he dies! -You're not such an asshole! No! Beto! -Dad, I don't want to die! -You have two kids, man! Think about it! Think about it! Son of a bitch! My money, man! Where's my money? Give me my money! You're done, Pedro. Brothers, my ass! Pedro... Beto. Beto! Let me see. It hurts, Dad! Forgive me, this is all my fault. Help me. Save him. Save him. Don't be afraid. Beto! Beto! Beto! -Beto! -What's going on? -What's going on? -Beto! -My boy! -Beto! Beto! Dad. Beto, are you okay? He needs to eat live blood. Drink my blood, Beto. There's no time. I love you, son. I don't need my crutches anymore! You cured me! Lina cured me! Dad! Don't be afraid, Beto. Don't be afraid. -Don't be afraid. -Dad! Don't be afraid. Goodbye, Dad. Goodbye.
