You afraid or what? We shouldn't be here JUILLET ELECTRIQUE Victor, calm down! Victor, what did I just say? Enough is enough boys! Enough... Beyond the windmills... If you walk long enough, there's this amazing place. Very few people made it that far. But those who did... It was mind-blowing. That's where we outta be. Anyway, I don't know why I'm telling you all that. You too scared, I'll go by myself. I'm not scared... Really? You'd dare to go into the swimming pool, alone in the dark? Without getting busted? Ok. You go into the swimming pool and you come back. Soaking wet. Don't go too far boys! When I call you, you come home right away, hear me! Yeah Yeah, whatever... Take the moped. You sure it's still far away? I don't know, we're fine here. You suck! You always scared... I thought it would be worth it to go there together But if you're too scared, never mind. No...alright, it's fine. Ok, let's see. Stop shaking, it can't work. Look at me. I'm sorry. The platform was even wider than you had imagined. Thousands of people... Cars... Some where jumping off the roof on their bikes. Others were dancing, leaping into the void... They weren't scared of anything. But that was not the end of it. The bridge kept going on and on, deep in the country. Who knows... maybe it never ends. Promise me we'll go.
