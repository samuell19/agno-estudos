[windmill whirring] [music playing] [man moans] [truck doors close] [woman groans] [sighs] [whispers] You're so gentle. Whatever works. [footsteps] [Ann] Jesus! - [Carter groans] - [Ann] No! - [Carter groans] - [Ann] No! - Leave him alone! - [grunts] - [groans] - [man] Get up! [thud] [groans] [man] You're screwin' everybody, aren't you? - You son of a bitch! - [Ann] No! [squeaking] [man] That should do it. [Anne panting] [Ann] Oh. Oh, my God. [sobbing] [gasping] It's all right. It's all right. The worst part's over now. [Ann] Yeah. We'll go away. We'll visit my family. You'd like my family. [bell dings] [woman] I just love this house. It's such a classic Victorian. It was built around 1886, probably remodeled slightly in the '40s. I know what you're thinking. Needs a lot of T.L.C., and it's a little pricier than what we were talking about originally. But remember, you've got two rental units downstairs to help you cover the mortgage. And I really think, relatively speaking, we can get this place for a song. - Up here. - [Drake] So, what do you think? 750 grand, huh? That's not a song, it's an opera. Between my savings and Drake's, we can cover the down payment. And the Realtor said that we could get one of those home-equity loans for improvements. You'll be totally tapped out. [Patty] But we'll have rental units. Well, what if you can't rent them? Oh, come on. The...the vacancy rate in this area is less than two percent. Look, you want my advice or my approval? - Your advice. - Your approval. [scoffs] Pass. It's too risky a call. I mean, if someone misses one month's rent, you're gonna go down like the Titanic. I don't even...I don't even think you can get approved for the loan at your income level. - We'll fudge the numbers a little. - Yeah. Everybody does it. It's expected. [Drake] Legal description of building. [Patty] It's a building. [Drake] Um, well I don't think that's what they mean. - It's...it's like you know... - [Patty] It...it's a... It's a wooden building with windows. [scoffs] All right. We'll come back to that one. [Patty] Um, my previous employment. Equestrienne. - That's too pompous. Self-employed. - [Drake] Okay. Manner in which title will be held? Like this. Please, please! Held with both hands with a goofy expression. I can't believe we're actually gonna do this. Marital status. - Single. - Single. [people cheering] - [man] Yeah, do it! - [woman] Yeah! Come on! Come on! Get it down, buddy! Come on! - Come on! Knock it down! - [people cheering] [Drake] Mine! Now it's all mine! [thud] [drilling] [Drake] If we rent the studio for 1,000. And the one-bedroom for 1,200. Thirteen hundred. You should go up and down. [Drake] All right, 1,300, that leaves us, uh... - Fourteen-hundred... - [Drake] Fourteen hundred dollars to cover the mortgage, which is $300 a month less than we used to be paying, for our two old apartments, so we're actually saving money. Yeah, assuming we don't go broke before we rent them. Then you've got to replace the plumbing and rewire the electric. We have to remember this is an investment, Patty. We can't afford to do everything at once. It's not just an investment. It's our home. - [Drake] You want something to drink? - [Patty] Sure. [cat meows] [Drake] Hey, there's a cat outside. Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty. [Patty] He'll be good luck. - Aw, he could be hungry. - Mm-hmm. Thanks. [Patty chuckles] [Patty] Mmm. I'm pooped. [clears throat] [sighs] [giggles] Is that your "manly" walk? It's the only walk I've got. [giggling] [Patty] You feel comfortable. - [Drake] Yeah? - [Patty] Mm-hmm. [Drake] Like your old saddle? [Patty] Better. I just wish I had some spurs. [Patty giggles] [Drake] Taste like turpentine. [both giggling] [Drake] Oh, that's better. - [man] Hi, there! - Good afternoon! Welcome to the neighborhood, huh? [Drake] Well, thank you. [man] I like your place. [Drake] Hi. Hi. How you doing today? Fine, thank you. - How do you like the color? - [man] Pretty good. [Drake] Hi! Mr. And Mrs. Thayer! Drake Goodman! I'm sorry I'm late! Ran into double overtime, and I forgot about our appointment. This is the apartment. - [Mr. Thayer] Oh! - [Drake] We're asking $1,300 a month plus a $2,000 security deposit. - [Mr. Thayer] Oh! - [keys clinking] You pay the gas and electric. And we pay the water and garbage. Here, take it. [Drake] In the back here, we have the kitchen. - [woman] Oh, great! - Brand-new gas stove, disposable microwave, refrigerator... [imitating race car] Stop that! [Patty] There's a full bath. All the original tile's been redone. It's the original bathtub. We'd want to repaint. Yeah. We'd pay for all the materials. It's just so chalky now. [Patty] What color did you have in mind? - Black. - Black. [speaking Japanese] [Patty] Here's the gas stove, the dishwasher, the microwave, the disposal. I'm sure Drake showed you all this. And your credit and references all checked out. [speaking Japanese] Oh, we'll paint over that. - Huh? - No, we'll paint over it. [speaking in Japanese] - You don't have children, do you? - No. This is a very nice place. - We just wanted to look at it again. - I understand. - To be sure. - Yeah. [microwave dings] Just got separated from my wife. I'm hell in the kitchen. [Mr. Baker] I've been thinking about taking a cooking class or something. [knock on door] Excuse me. [speaking in Japanese] We will take the apartment. Oh, great! Okay. [Mr. Watanabe] We would like to start moving in by tomorrow. Pardon me. A thousand a month? Yeah. Oh, and a $1,500 security deposit. I can handle that. [Patty] I'll have the key for you in the morning, then. - Thank you. - Thank you, Mr. Watanabe. - [Mrs. Watanabe] Arigatou. - [Patty] Arigatou, Mrs. Watanabe. Bye-bye. [door shuts] Uh, any chance I can pay you half now, half at the end of the month? I'm in this 90-day Cd. We'll have to check your credit. No sweat. My credit's solid. [scoffs] Actually, I've been looking to buy a place, but I haven't found anything I like for the price yet. [Patty] Mm-hmm. Here you go. I said my credit is solid. Well, you still have to fill out an application, and Drake will wanna check it out. Understand something. I want this apartment. My credit is good. - I don't want to lose it because... - Obviously, you're at the top of the list, Mr. Baker. You're the first person who's seen the place. Yeah. [chuckles] Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. - Uh, Ms. Palmer? - Yes? I'm sorry. I just get the runaround so much, you know? That's okay. No sweat. I'll get this back to you as soon as I can. [Patty] Okay. [bell buzzing] - Patty? - [Patty] In here. I'm sick. [buzzing continues] What's the matter? [Patty] I'll be all right. Answer the door. It might be Mr....what's his name? For the key to downstairs. [buzzing continues] - [Drake] Morning. - [man] Good morning [indistinct chatter] - [Drake] Morning. - [man] Morning. Mrs. Watanabe, these are the keys to the back apartment. - I'm so sorry so early. - It's okay. I'll just...I'll just go get dressed. All these people aren't moving in with you, are they? [laughs] [speaking Japanese] [continue speaking in Japanese] [Carter] Mr. Palmer, right? Goodman. Drake Goodman. - [Carter] Sorry. - [car door closes] Very good. - [Drake] Hi. - Hi, I'm Carter Hayes. I stopped by a couple of weeks ago and spoke with your wife about renting the studio apartment. My...my girlfriend. Oh, you're girlfriend. Oh, sorry. We don't want to rush anything, do we? I assume it's still available? Yes, it is. Um... Is Patty here? I don't wanna keep you, if you've got... No, it's no problem. You know, I'm... I'm taking care of the rentals, did she show you the apartment? No. No, I'd like to look at it, if I might. Oh, good. Yeah, we can go this way. [Carter] Listen, is it all right if I leave my car here? - Yeah. - [Carter] Thanks. [car alarm beeps] [Carter] Boy, you've done a beautiful job here. [Drake] Thank you. It's uh, it's taken just about every cent we've got. Yeah, I'll bet. I love these old Victorians. My grandmother, uh, my father's mother, I guess it was grew up in a mansion in pacific heights. Oh, yeah? Whereabouts? Uh, Broadway and uh, I don't know. I don't know. They tore it down. I'd never actually been there, but I had seen the photographs, you know and I'd heard all the stories. Boy, can you imagine what that piece of real estate would be worth today, huh? Well, you know we all got to start somewhere. [Carter] Yeah. - Is this your first place? - [Drake] Yes, it is. You and your girlfriend went in on it together? [Drake] Yeah, you know partners. [Carter] Yeah. It's hard, isn't it? Well, it's the first time we've lived together. It's...it's working though. [scoffs] Not to mention the rent we're saving. [footsteps] When can I move in, Drake? Oh well, you know I'll just have to have you just fill out an application... You know, I'd like to...if you don't mind pay you the first six months in advance. Well, I still need you to get the... I may even have it on me. Uh, the reason for the six months is I travel a lot on my business. And I'm in and out of the country, so I can't always guarantee that I'll be here. The first of the month. Damn. I've only got about $2,900... on me. How about if I pay you 2,000 now, and then, of course, I could pay you the rest next week, or I could wire you the entire amount, which would be... - seventy... - Seventy-five hundred. Seventy-five hundred from my bank in San Antonio. Um...you know, I'm sorry, but I still have to get this application filled out. It's just a formality. Yeah, it's a credit history, that sort of thing. Yeah. Um, is there a problem? Well, no. It's just that I work for a private trust. And the trust pays me my expenses and my salary. They pay my bank cards, my room and board, et cetera. So I don't really have that traditional kind of credit. - You understand? - [Drake] Um, could I verify the trust? Well, see, I'm bound by client confidentiality. I mean, they're a prominent family and they've got interests worldwide. Boy, believe me, I would if I could. Let me think. I'm always running into this problem, you know? - Do you have a phone? - Yeah, upstairs. You know, better yet. I'll tell you what. Why don't I give you some local personal references, or call the trust private attorney, Bennett Fidlow? - [Drake] Yeah, okay. A previous landlord. - [Carter] I got it. Yeah, I hope you don't mind calling out of town. I don't think you'll have a problem. [Drake] No, no. Mr. Hayes listed Mr. Fidlow as a personal reference on a rental application. [woman on the phone] I'm sorry, what was that name again? Carter Hayes. - [woman] Hayes. Mr. Fidlow only handles... - Ma'am, ma'am! Yes, Mr. Hayes told me that it was a private family trust. This is just a personal reference. [woman] Yes. Well, he'll have to give you that information himself. [Drake] I see. Well, when Mr. Fidlow gets the time, - could you please have him call me? - [woman] I will. Goodbye. [dial tone] [Ann] No, no. He was a model tenant. Always paid his rent on time, left the unit spotlessly clean. In fact, I think I gave him his whole security deposit back. That was the first time I've ever done that. [Drake] So, you can definitely recommend Mr. Hayes? I can recommend him to you with no hesitation at all. [Drake] Thank you. I'd like to thank you for your time. Listen, um, just out of curiosity, uh, where has Carter moved to, Mr., uh, Mr.... - [Drake] Goodman. - Mr. Goodman. Just...just out of curiosity, do you have that address? [Patty] What about Mr. Baker? - [Drake] What about him? - He was here first. No, where's his application? Maybe he's one of those minority scam artists. What are you talking about? No, they...they try to get you worried about discrimination, so you don't check their credit. That's not what happened. Some of these people can be pretty shrewd, Patty. How would you know? It's not a racial thing. It's just common sense. Look, I...I spoke to the woman at the bank and she told me that Carter Hayes' income is over $200,000 a year. I've checked him out. Okay, fine. Then let's rent to him if you say he's okay. He's a nice guy. You met him. - When? - A couple weeks ago. I said he came by and talked to you. I don't think so. He knew your name. Why would he say he talked to you? If he hadn't. I don't know. Look, Patty, I'm just taking up the slack here. I mean, you're worried about paint and the wallpaper. Somebody's got to rent these two apartments, so we can make next month's mortgage. You're losing your sense of humor. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. You're becoming a crotchety, old man with his building. Next thing I know, you're gonna have hair growing out of weird parts of your face. You'll be wandering around with a toilet plunger and griping about property taxes and people who take long showers. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. [chuckles] - You don't think, I can handle this? - Yes, I do. [child shrieks] [indistinct pounding] Somebody in here? [Carter] Oh, hi. I thought you were from the, uh, phone company. [Patty] Who are you? I'm your new tenant. I'm Carter Hayes. You must be Patty, right? Yeah. I think I spoke with you a couple of weeks ago... No, you didn't. How did you get in here? Well, the door was open a little and I just opened it and came on in. I didn't want to ring the buzzer and bother you so early, so I just... let myself in. Hope that's okay. Drake said, it would be all right if I came by for the phone installation. Oh. Was that you hammering? No. You did a great job restoring this place. Thanks. Did you pick those light fixtures out? Yeah. [Carter] You have nice taste. Thanks. Nice meeting you. [door shuts] I found a roofer. It's gonna cost us 75 bucks for an estimate. It's a good thing I rented that other apartment. Mr. Hayes is downstairs. What do you mean he's downstairs? In the apartment. - Did you let him in? - He was already in. I told him he can't move in till we get his money. Well, I heard hammering, and there he was. What was he hammering? He said he wasn't. Mr. Hayes? - It's Drake Goodman. - [knocking] Carter? Is anybody in there? [suspenseful music] I'm sorry, but we have no record of a wire transfer to your account, Mr. Goodman... My tenant assured me the money would be wired today. Bank of Texas, $7,500. Maybe the bank lost the money or it got credited to the wrong account. [woman] It's doubtful, but I'd need the transaction numbers to tell you anything more. It is possible he never wired the money, Mr. Goodman, for his own reasons. Please, just check the account one more time. [woman clears throat] [typing] - [drill whirs] - [knocking] [whirring stops] Who...who are you? Who are you? I'm the landlord. Oh. Carter went to Seattle on business. He'll be back on Friday. Carter was supposed to wire me some money for his... his rent and security deposit. It never came... Look, I don't know anything about that. You're gonna have to talk to Carter, okay? What's your name? - Greg. - Greg, listen. If you speak to Carter before Friday, would you please tell him that he's got this problem, - with his rent and security deposit... - Well, that sounds like your problem okay? Ask him to call me with the transaction numbers or give them to you to give to me. So we can straighten this out. Yeah. I'll be sure to give him the message. [door slams, locks] [speaking Japanese] [crash] [speaking Japanese] [Patty] Oh, you just hit a wire. It's okay. - Oh. - I'll go down and fix it. Um, don't pull that nail until I say it's okay. All right. [Mr. Watanabe] You require new wires. This is a very dangerous situation. [speaking Japanese] [Patty] Okay! [speaking Japanese] I got it! [Patty] Is it on? [Drake] No! How 'bout now? [Drake] Not yet! [Patty] Drake? [Drake] No, Patty! [flicking switches] Did that do it? [Drake] Not yet! There you go! [Patty] Okay! Mr. Hayes? Is that you? Mr. Hayes? [suspenseful music] - [Patty] Drake? - [Drake] Hey, you fixed it. Hayes is down there. Sitting in his car. He was just watching me. [car engine revs] [Drake] Hayes? Hey! [tires screech] [Drake] No, thank you. I've left my number before and Mr. Fidlow has never returned my phone call. - [woman] What was that name again? - Carter Hayes. H-a-y-e-s. I've left you all this information before. [woman] Well, I'm sorry, sir. We do not have a client by that name. Well maybe, maybe you can explain to me, how it is that Mr. Fidlow doesn't know a Carter Hayes. When Mr. Hayes, who's locked himself into my goddamn apartment. And hasn't paid me any rent keeps telling me to call his goddamn attorney, tenant Fidlow in San fucking Antonio, Texas! Hello? [screams] Hello? [slams telephone] [Patty] Okay, what's the most important thing I said to remember when we're riding? - [children] We're the boss. - [Patty] That's right. And why are we the boss? - [children] 'Cause we're smarter. - [Patty] Absolutely. [giggles] [horse neighs] [Patty] Okay, that's enough for today. Dismount. - Can you take over, Donna? - Okay. - [Drake] Hi. - [Patty] Hey. [Donna] Okay, guys. You remember? Put the reigns in your right hand... You look so serious. Rough day at work. It's a kite-eat-kite world out there, Patty. You know, I was...I was thinking maybe we could sneak out tonight. I made a reservation down at mama jam's. [Patty] I don't know if I'm up to it. [Drake] Ah, a bottle of wine, a nice dinner. It'll do us both good. I went to the doctor today. Why? Well, I can't seem to shake this flu that I've been fighting. So I figured I'd just make an appointment and go. What did he say? [scoffs] It's definitely not the flu. [Drake] Well, that's good, then. You know, maybe we'd both feel better if we went out and had some fun. Hayes' rent didn't come, did it? No. Tomorrow, probably. - Probably? - Yeah, it's a bank mix-up. Look, I'm on top of it, don't worry about it... - [Patty] Drake. - Look, I got us into this, Patty. I'm gonna get us out of it. End of discussion. End of discussion? [horse neighs] The doctor says I'm pregnant. Oh. [sighs] Oh, wow. Congratulations. [Patty chuckles] [indistinct pounding] [banging and pounding] [meows] [telephone rings] Hello. - [Mr. Watanabe] Uh, Ms. Palmer? - Who is this? [drill whirs] - [Drake] Yeah. - I come here and knock. Nobody answers. Hammering stops. I go back... Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam! [hammering] I don't like this guy. [drill whirs] It's Drake Goodman, the landlord. May I come in? Look, I know you're in there. I can hear you in there. I've got a key, so if you don't open the door, I'm just gonna come in anyway. He's changed the locks. You changed the fucking locks! All right. All right. Good night! [suspenseful music playing] [Drake] I don't care if he comes through with the money now or not. I just want him out. No harm, no foul. He leaves right away, he doesn't owe us anything. Goodbye, good riddance. - [doorbell buzzes] - [Patty] Now what? [Drake] Jeez. [buzzing] Yes, who is it? [policeman] San Francisco, police department. They were doing construction at two fucking 30 in the morning. They won't answer the door! I can't use my key to get in, because they changed all the fucking locks! [policeman] I don't appreciate foul language, sir. Sir, may I say something? My friend is a sculptor. And he was working a little late last night. - I'm very sorry if it kept anyone up... - Bullshit! You back off! Look, he hasn't even paid his rent! Ask him! Apparently, there has been a mix-up in the wire transfer of my money in San Francisco. I'm sorry. They've moved in there, they've changed all the locks. So I can't see what he and his - little buddy are destroying. - I signed the lease. [Drake] He hasn't paid the rent or even a security fucking deposit! - [Patty] Drake, take it easy. - Look, I can handle this, Patty! - Fine. - [Carter] Listen, listen, listen! I understand, why Mr. Goodman is upset. His bank lost my money, I was out of town. The man's caught in the middle. I don't even wanna file a complaint. But I don't understand why he wouldn't give me the opportunity to straighten things out. Unless he's found someone he'd rather rent to... This is such bullshit! - Come on! - Look, let's take a walk. - Come on. Now! - I just... I just want the guy to pay his rent! [policeman] Come on. Cool it down. [Drake] What? What? [policeman] What you did is against the law. Listen, Patty, I'm sorry it's come to this. The bank assures me that the money's been sent. - I don't think Drake understands... - I'd like you to not talk to me. [policeman] Listen to me, listen. [Drake] I just want the guy the hell out of my house. Well, then you better listen to me, or he's gonna be so far up your butt, you're gonna be picking him out your nose. Now, I want you to turn back on all the heat and all the power to this man's apartment. You apologize, and you do not... and I emphasize do not, harass him again. Then go out and get yourself a lawyer. Because according to California civil code, Mr. Hayes can sue you for this stunt you just pulled. And most likely he'll win. He doesn't even have a right to be in the apartment... - Are you listening to me... - He hasn't paid the rent... Are you listening to me? If he's in, he's got rights. That's how it works. And I'll tell you something else, friend. If he decides to fight an eviction, you're already knee-deep in shit. Get a lawyer. [Stephanie] He's taken possession, so whether he signed a lease or whether he paid you money or not, he's legally your tenant now. And he's protected by laws that say you have to go to court and prove that he deserves to be evicted. However, the net effect of these laws, is to protect any pointy-headed cretin, who moves into your property. And slowly drives you bankrupt and insane. - [Patty] So what do we do? - I can take on the case. [Patty] What are our chances of winning? No guarantees. Uh, my base fee for an uncontested case is $250. We charge $90 an hour thereafter and a minimum of $360 for any court appearances. How long will it take? Uncontested, six to eight weeks. If he contests? Six to eight months, worst case. And then, you have to go after him in court again to collect. Wouldn't it just be a lot easier to throw him out? Easy and wrong. This is the process, folks. There aren't any shortcuts. I need a description of Hayes for Mr. Revilla, my process server. And I need the key to your front door. - Is Carter Hayes in? - No. I have some important documents for him. [door locks] Okay. All right. [car horn] Get 'em shined, get 'em shined. Shine 'em up. Buddy, you need to get in the bank and get a loan. Look at them shoes. All right. low-investment loans for people with shoes like yours. Come here. Get that good shine right here. I'll put a glow on that toe. All right, who's next? Ladies in skirts, half-price. Come here, sunshine. Get that half-price special right here on Dr. Shoe love. Get 'em shined. Get 'em shined here. Line 'em up. Line 'em up. [Dennis] All right, all right. Let me just guess what they said. As much as we'd like to help you, we just can't afford to string out the loan. Wouldn't be fair to us, and it wouldn't be fair to you, - right? - Right. They tell you the bank is pulling for you, that no one wants to foreclose a loan? They tell you that? It's horse-pucky, banker speak. So what...what do we do now, Reed? I could loan you maybe a grand, but that's not gonna help. It's not gonna do it. And there are alternative lenders, you know, high-interest houses that specialize in burying you. "Let a smile be your umbrella." [Drake] Great. - I could start riding again. - Well, that's a good idea, Patty. You're pregnant, with a blown knee. You seriously think that you could ride a horse in competition... Wait a minute. Are you pregnant? My knee is fine, and I don't have to be pregnant... Look, I'm not going to lose you, I'm not going to lose our child, - and I'm not going to lose our house. - Drake. Well, I guess we can just stop worrying now. Listen to this. "Dear Drake and Patty, I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding, that has come between us. Please accept this gift, in my sincere hope that we can work everything out, Carter Hayes." [meowing] Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. [meows] [Mrs. Watanabe screams] Mrs. Patty! Mrs. Patty! Help! Mrs. Patty! Kitchen! Kitchen! Kitchen! [speaking Japanese] Okay, okay. - [speaking in Japanese] - [Patty] In here? - [Mrs. Watanabe] Coco...coco... - [Patty] What? [both scream] Oh, shit! Oh! Shit! Oh! Oh! [exterminator] The San Francisco roach, generally German or oriental in derivation. With your krauts edging out your rice grinders, in the overall disgustingness factor. But I think these were American. How are we supposed to pay for this? - We're $1,100 short this month! - Don't yell at me! If we don't do it, Macdonald says we lose the eviction. We can't afford that, either. Maybe we should borrow money for this. - No, no! We're not gonna borrow money! - This is stupid. We should just let this building go! [Drake] Okay, fine! You do whatever you want! I'm not letting this jerk chase me out of my own property! [exterminator] It's the promiscuity factor that makes it hard to hammer down. I'll be using your clog purifiers and Pyrethrum, and a high-pressure injection system. I've also got the R.S.U. - What's that? - Roach sucking unit. It's just a backup. [whimpers] Whoa! They're coming in from next door! Oh, shit! Whoa, reinforcements! [whimpers] They probably camped out in the other apartment. If we go at it from over there, we have a better chance of containing them. What if we can't? Get a whole bunch of little, tiny leashes and pretend they're pets. [Drake] I'm sorry. You know... our luck... has got to change tomorrow. Maybe. [knock on door] [doorbell buzzes] - [door opens] - [doorbell buzzes] - [Patty] Yeah? - Uh, Carter Hayes lives here, doesn't he? [Patty clears throat] Yes. Yeah well, do you know if he's in? Because I've been ringing the buzzer and there doesn't seem to be any answer. [Patty] I don't know. - [Ann] Is Carter Hayes in there? - Uh, no, he's not here. Look, I'm Ann. Did he tell you about me? He must have told you about me. Ann from the desert? Look, I've been driving all night. I don't have time for this shit. Now, I know that he's in there. I'm not leaving until I talk to him... Why don't you just come in here, okay? [Ann] Let go of me. What are you doing? - [Greg] Shut up! - [Ann] Are you his partner? - [Greg] Shut up! - [Ann] Are you his partner... [Greg] That's none of your business... - [Ann] I need to talk to him. - [Greg] About what? [Ann] Come on, you're not that stupid. Figure it out. [woman] No, I'm sorry. It was a gift. [man] Was it 18-karat gold, 14-karat gold? [woman] I...I have no knowledge of jewelry. I...I just...I'm sorry. I just need the money. Desperately. [woman] Next! The only way I can swing it is if you deposit $5,800 with us. If you do that, I can give you $5,000. [man] That's what we call a secured loan. You could probably get the money in a couple of days. No qualifying. If I had $5,800, I wouldn't need to borrow anything. [man] Right. I guess we won't be doing any business then. Wait a minute. Your ad in the yellow pages, your ad said that you give high-risk loans, that you specialize in giving loans to people who can't get a loan anyplace else. Lady, don't believe everything you read, okay? I've gone through the figures three times. I cannot do it. All I'm asking for is $5,000 to get us through the next few months. You have a $750,000 piece of property here. Sell your building and keep the change. Can't sell the building. - [woman] Is she done yet? - She's done. [suspenseful music playing] [distant banging and shuffling] [Greg] Is there something you wanna tell me, man? [Carter] What do you mean? [Greg] I think there's a lot of stuff you're not telling me, Carter. [Carter] I'm sure there are a lot of things I'm not telling you. [Greg] Your girlfriend came by the other day. [Carter] So? [Greg] So, she told me the two of you made 250 grand on a real-estate deal like this, and she didn't see any of it. - [thud] - [Carter] She's mistaken. She's a useless bitch. She was paid. She didn't even have to do anything. I had the whole thing bartered. Listen to me. Listen to me carefully, okay? This is my business. I'm very good at it, Greg. - [Greg] Yeah? - Yeah! Then how come we're getting evicted so soon? You said, man, that wasn't gonna happen... I told you from the fucking get-go, there was gonna be certain risks involved and you have to be flexible! [Greg] Yeah, well, don't bullshit me, Carter! Look, I just want you to know that I know, man, if you try and cut me out, man... - What, Greg? - Just don't do it! [thud] [grunts] [grunts] [meows] [tires squeal] [door opens] [Patty] Drake? Drake! - Drake? - What? Oh, God. I almost ran over that guy from downstairs. I thought maybe you'd gotten in a fight with him. [Drake] They've got our cat down there, and they're breeding roaches. Apparently, screwing people over is just a job to them. What are you talking about? [Drake] Isn't that the best? I mean, our life is coming apart. And this son of a bitch just thinks it's business as usual. [Patty] Oh, Drake. - This is what he does for a living. - You're drunk. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - What? - You'll like this too. This was under the door when I came in. It's from the Watanabes. [laughs] Oh. [Mr. Watanabe] It's the noise and the bugs and... and my wife. She can't sleep. Me...I'm so sorry. It's no good. You signed a lease for one year, Mr. Watanabe. [Mr. Watanabe] I will try to pay you back. Moving expense, new apartment expense, lots of expense. You can take me to court, sue me, but... [Mrs. Watanabe] So sorry. I'm so sorry. [sighs] Well...[scoffs] I guess there's nothing else to say. Good fortune. [Patty] Yeah. [indistinct conversations] [Judge] In answer to your suit against him, Mr. Hayes has submitted to the court affidavits a and b. Confirming plaintiff's attempted unlawful eviction of a Mr. Hayes, on the 15th of last May. I turned his gas and electricity off. There was a police... Your...your honor, my client tonight... [Judge] Ms. Macdonald, I assume - you have received these documents... - Yes. I have just received them. I think there's been a mix-up. I think the law is quite clear on this point, don't you? Mr. Hayes is entitled to a reduction of rent due to uninhabitability, caused by Mr. Goodman's misguided attempt to force him from the premises by disconnecting his utilities. Court rules for the defendant, Carter Hayes. Let the record show that according to the lease, Mr. Hayes' legal costs will be paid by the plaintiff. Your honor, I would like to ask for a ten-minute postponement. [Judge] Ms. Macdonald, I see where you have other cases before this court today. I hope you're better prepared for them. I assume you'll want to cooperate with the bench now, in keeping things moving? - Yes, sir. - [judge hits gavel] That's it? Why didn't you tell me you tried to force him out? - I didn't think it mattered. - You set us back months. He's lying! This guy has been playing you like a piano concerto. Me? What about you? I got a guy living in my building hasn't paid me one cent! Not only can't you get him out, but now I owe him money? Maybe you'd like to retain another attorney. Stephanie... please don't quit. Drake's been under a lot of pressure. The bank is threatening to foreclose on us. This isn't a moral question, Patricia. Morally, you're right. You win. Big deal. This is a game, and the object of the game is to get Mr. Hayes out of your building before he destroys your lives. He knows you're gonna get him out eventually. He's just trying to stay there as long as he can. - Why? - I don't know. Because it's possible. Because he's evil. What difference does it make? It's nothing personal. God forbid he ever makes it personal.

[water running] - [Patty crying] - [Drake] Patty? [sobbing] - Patty. - [Patty grunting] [grunts] [Doctor] Just a couple more tests for you. - [Drake] Hi. - Hi. How do you feel? I feel like lady Macbeth. There was so much blood. Everything's gonna be all right. You know the doctor says we can even try again after a few months. [crying] [crying] [rings] [woman on the phone] 911 emergency. Give me the police, please. Something's gotta change, Drake. You and me and this place, it's just not working. Drake? What do you expect me to say to that, Patty? "Fine."? "Nice knowing you."? - Jesus! - That's not what I meant! I don't know what to expect anymore. Maybe that's part of the problem. I'm sorry I talked you into buying this place. You didn't talk me into anything. Patty... something was right about us before. Whatever else that's got screwed up, we have to remember that. [knock on door] Hi, I didn't want to... intrude, but I heard the ambulance last night, and I called the hospital, and they told me what happened. God, nature can be so cruel sometimes. Anyway, Patty, I wanted to offer my condolences, and if there's anything at all I can do to help.. [groans] Drake! [Patty] Drake! Drake, stop! Stop it! Drake, stop it! You'll kill him! Stop it! Drake, goddamn it! [grunts] Stop it! [grunts] Drake, are you all right? Are you all right? I'm sorry, Patty. [Patty] It's okay. [sirens wailing] [Patty] No, no, no! No! No! Officer! Officer! Hey, hey! Don't hurt him! What are you all looking at me for? [grunts] [policeman] You have the right to remain silent. [Drake screams] Anything you say can and will be used against you... Please don't hurt him! ...you have the right to speak to an attorney... You're arresting the wrong man! Can I go with him? - No. - Please! [policeman] Keep struggling and I'll break your goddamn arm! Watch your head! You got the wrong fucking man! You arrested the wrong man! [Engine revs] [sighs] There's nothing you can do until the arraignment tomorrow morning. He needs a criminal law specialist, Patricia. I'm out of my depth here. I can recommend somebody. My guess is that Hayes doesn't care about the criminal charges. He's gonna go after Drake with a civil suit. This is what he wanted. Game's over. Drake loses. Can I give you a ride home? [clears throat] [Patty] What does this do to the eviction? [Stephanie] Ironically, nothing. We'll get him out. Of course, Hayes might get the building before he's through, because of the civil suit. It's lucky you're not married, otherwise Drake would pull you down with him. I had a miscarriage last night. I know. I need to know where Drake will be staying. He'll be at home with me. Patty, Hayes is asking for a temporary restraining order, because of the assault. Drake can't come within 500 feet of the building as long as Hayes is there. This is our home. - This is all happening to us in our home. - I know. - Do you want a hand? - No, no, I got it. Ooh, I'm gonna get some clean sheets. These look pretty rude. [door unlocking] [telephone rings] Hello? Hello? [Carter] Patty... you know... I think that under different circumstances... you and I could have gotten to be good friends. [dial tone] [operator] The time allotted for you to dial has been exceeded. Please hang up and dial again. The time allotted for you to dial has been exceeded... [classical music plays loudly] [disconnected call tone] [Dennia] Get it started, now watch this. Voilà! [telephone rings] [Drake] I'll get that. Hang on, man, don't burn the house down. - Hello? - Hi, it's me, um... [Drake] Is everything all right? I just wanted to see how you were doing. [Drake] Fine. It only hurts when I blink. [chuckling] - [Patty] Um... - Is something wrong? No, I...I just...I miss you. [Drake] Why don't you come over here? Yeah, I mean look this is ridiculous. Why don't you come over here and spend the night? No, it's okay. Um, somebody's gotta be here. [Drake] Nobody has to be there. - Tell me what's wrong. - Everything's fine. - [Drake] No, Patty... - I'd better... - I'd better go. Don't worry. - [Drake] Patty... - Bye. - [Drake] Patty, Patty? You know... [sighs] [door unlocks] [step creaks] [Carter] You're a very brave and stupid man. What are you doing, Drake? You can't come in here. Listen, Carter. It's no big deal. I just want to go upstairs and see Patty, okay? But you're breaking the law, Drake. W...wait a minute. - [gunshot] - [grunts] [grunting] [heart monitor beeping] Hi. I really screwed things up. I don't know what I've been trying to prove. Shh! Don't talk. What was I trying to prove? You don't have to prove anything. Go to sleep. - [Drake] I love you. - I love you, too. [Henry] We have no case because Hayes was technically within his right to protect himself. I mean, Goodman threatens Hayes, who fearing for his life, justifiably, based upon the previous assault complaint defends himself. You're the D.A. Henry, make a case! There's a history of mutual animosity here. There's a history of Goodman assaulting Hayes. I can make a case, but I can't win it. What's the point? They're a nice couple. Right. Well, at least the default judgment came through today. We're evicting the son of a bitch tomorrow. [man] I'll need you to sign right here. [knock on door] Mr. Carter Hayes? It's the sheriff's department, Mr. Hayes. We've come to see you out. The appointed locksmith, Manford beagle, will facilitate entry at this point. [drill whirs] [man] Ohh! [flies buzzing] Oh, my God. [sighs] [coughs] - [Patty groans] - [Sheriff] Damn. God, this is bad. [man] How much can he make off of this crap? [Sheriff] Who knows? [sobbing] Ohh! [Patty sobbing] God! [breathing heavily] [police officer] Look, I don't have his name yet. He's still probably at the station... Gas stove, microwave, disposal, dishwasher, two sinks, one toilet? Um, about how many electrical fixtures would you guess? I don't know. Okay, well it's not important, but you know, we will need it for your insurance. We're gonna need a complete list. Our insurance was cancelled. [telephone rings] - Yeah? - [man] Is Patricia Palmer still with you? Yeah, she's right here. - [man] I'd like to speak with her. - Yeah, sure. Come on in. That's my boss. I recognized the name on the report. You two know each other? Bobby, why don't you take these upstairs, see if we can get a running start on where this cretin might fence the appliances? - Sure thing, Lieutenant. - Thank you. I guess you're wishing now you'd rented to the black man. You never brought back your application. I brought it back. I never got it. Uh-huh. The Porsche in your garage was leased. Hayes made one payment, put stolen plates on it. They've been looking for him ever since. I sent a tow to haul away what's left of it. He shot my boyfriend. I know. You're lucky he didn't kill him. This is a sick individual, Ms. Palmer. Be grateful he's out of your life. Right now, you don't mean a thing to him. Leave it that way. If he's gonna get caught, we'll catch him. He shot my boyfriend. My boyfriend is in the hospital. He destroyed our property. There are lawsuits, there's the foreclosure. I had a miscarriage. And you're telling me to forget about him? Next time, maybe he ain't so lucky. Next time, maybe he runs into the man, who blows his brains out. Next time? [Mr. Baker] Let him go, Ms. Palmer. [sighs] [Patty] Hi. Mr. Fidlow, please? [woman on the phone] May I ask what it's concerning? [Patty] It's regarding James Danforth. [intercom beeps] Yes, ma'am? [woman on the phone] It's a Patricia Palmer on line one, - regarding James Danforth. - All right. Put her through. How can I help you? [Patty] Um, yeah, you represent Charles and James Danforth? I'm executor of the family trust. A special Conservatorship Benefitting James Danforth. But this should not be confused with being his attorney, - whatever he's told you. - [Patty] Mr. Fidlow, are you aware... And furthermore, whatever James has done... the trust cannot be touched, and neither I nor his brother can or will be held accountable for his activities. You mean his family pays him to stay away? [Mr. Fidlow chuckles] I'm afraid I can't comment on that. Where is he now? [Mr. Fidlow] Look, you just best let this - sleeping dog lie. - Where... [Mr. Fidlow] Lady, he's been out of control for a long time. Well, maybe I should just go to his brother directly. You can't touch it, Ms. Palmer. James has no assets, the trust cannot be attached, and he is legally severed from his family. [Patty] I don't want money, Mr. Fidlow. I just want to know where he is. He doesn't tell me where he is, ever. [Patty] Well, then tell me where he's been. [Ann] He's far and away the most intelligent man I've ever met. He's not your type. Oh, it's okay to want him. It's a free country. I could tell, you know, when I saw you up in Frisco, I could tell you had a thing for him. [Patty] Are you his type? What do you think? I think you're sitting here waiting for him, and meanwhile, he's blowing you off. And it's pretty pathetic. You don't even know him. You don't even know his real name. It isn't Hayes, you know. It isn't Carter Hayes. Carter Hayes is the stupid old man who owned this condo. He tried to throw us out, he sent his tough guys after us to rough us up. But now look who's here and look who's not. You're the pathetic one, and he didn't blow me off. He sent me a postcard just yesterday. Read it. He's not like anyone else. He does whatever he wants. We understand each other. That's what we have. You? You're just chasing a shadow. [Victor] Yes, André. I need it delivered immediately to room 1515. [Patty] Excuse me. [Victor] Yes. Thank you. Do you have someone named carter Hayes staying here? Hayes? I'll check. [typing] No, I'm sorry. We don't. How about Goodman... Drake Goodman? Goodman? I'll check. [computer beeps] We do, but I see that he's out. Oh. Well, um, he left this in the store where I work. - Do you think you could give it to him? - Certainly. Would you care to leave your name or number... No, thank you. [telephone rings] Front desk, Victor. Hello? [man in middle eastern accent] Special delivery, room 81? [Victor] Special delivery has not yet arrived. [man] Yes, special delivery. Room 81? [Victor] special delivery has not yet arrived. It's not here. - Special delivery is not here... - [man] It must be here. Not arrived? Are you sure? Bye. Bye-bye. Thank you. Yes. - [Carter] Ten thirty-one. - [Victor] Ten thirty-one. - [Victor] Mr. Goodman? - [Carter] That's right. - [Victor] No messages. - [Carter] All right. [Victor] Oh, a young woman returned your wallet, sir. - [Carter] Pardon me? - [Victor] She said she found it in the store where she works. [Carter] Oh, yeah. Great, thanks. [suspenseful music plays] [doorbell chimes] [woman] Mr. Goodman, how are you? - How are you? - Come on in. [laughter in distance] [car door opens] [horn blares] Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you. I was just wondering if you could let me into my room. My dumb husband has locked me out. Which room? Ten thirty-one, Goodman. Well... okay. Thank you so much. I didn't know what I was gonna do. Thanks a lot. - Okay. - [door shuts] [sighs] [Patty whispering] Oh, God! Oh! [gasps] Goddamn son of a bitch! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Goddamn motherfucker! [knock on door] Is everything okay? [Patty] Yes. [telephone rings] Hello? [Patty] Oh, good. I am so glad you're home. You're not. Where are you? - You went after him, didn't you? - [Patty] Absolutely! Look, I don't have much time. And I need you to help me, okay? Call and cancel all your credit cards. Hayes is using duplicates - with your name on them. - [Drake sighs] Great! Then, call the bank and put a hold on our checking account. - [Drake] Why? - There's a 24-hour hot line. I think the number's on top of... [Drake] On top of the last bank statement, I know...what are you doing? Something that's gonna make us feel really good. - [Drake] Well, be careful. - I'll be back tonight, bye. [room service] Hello! Room service. - Hi, this is Mrs. Goodman in room 1031. - [room service] Yes? Yeah, my husband and I would like to have a small dinner party up here tonight and charge it to the room. [room service] Of course. What would you like? Um, let's see. I'd like to have vichyssoise... - [room service] The vichyssoise. - ...and Caesar salad... - [room service] The caesar salad. - ...and filet mignon. Oh, and what do you have for dessert? Do you have... - Do you have Crème Brûlée? - [room service] Of course, we do! - Yes, with raspberry sauce. - Oh, that sounds really good. [room service] Yes, very good. What beverage would you like? [Patty] We'll need a full bar and um, coffee with the dessert. [room service] Of course, and how many people is this for? [Patty] Eighteen. - [room service] Eighteen? Very good. - [Patty] M-hmm. - [Patty] And how long will that be? - [room service] At least two hours. [Patty] Two hours? Can you put a rush on it? - [room service] Oh, we try, we try, yes. - [Patty] Great! By the way, it's our anniversary today and my husband would like to send a bottle of champagne to everybody staying on the tenth floor. [room service] Everyone on the tenth floor? - Hmm. - [room service] That's very generous. Well, that's the kind of man that he is. Thank you. - Good evening, Victor. - [Victor] Good evening, Mr. Goodman. - Any messages? - Ten thirty-one No messages. Mr. Goodman. May I please have a word with you? I'm sorry to trouble you, sir, But we seem to be having a problem with your credit card. Really? What kind of a problem? This is lieutenant Palmer from the San Francisco police department. - [man] Yes ma'm, can I help you? - Mm-hmm. I was wondering if you leased a black Cadillac coupe De ville with the license plate number 2PET764. - [man] 2PET764. - [Patty] to a man named Drake Goodman. [man] Let me check. Yes, we did. - [Patty] You did? - [man] Why? [Patty] Well, there are some things that I think, you might be interested in knowing. Well listen, why don't I write you a check to take care of things until we get this straightened out? I don't...uh, that wouldn't be acceptable. I'm sorry. We called your bank as a backup, you know. - Yeah. - They said your account has been frozen. [Patty] Yes, I'd like to report some stolen traveler's checks - [woman] Lost or stolen? - No, no, my husband - is certain that they've been stolen. - [woman] Stolen? Mm-hmm, all 30 of them. Well, I assume you got the necessary approval when I checked in! Well, yes, but when a customer charges over $100 to their room, we generally run a card again for approval and that's when we discovered the problem. Right, except I didn't charge anything to my room. It's probably a clerical error on their part. But we have to look out for ourselves. - You understand? - I didn't charge anything to my room! Well, maybe it was your wife. My what? [telephone rings] [suspenseful music plays] [manager] Mr. Goodman? Excuse me... - Mr. Goodman? - Not now! Taxi! - [man] Good evening, ma'am. - [indistinct chatter] [manager] Mr. Goodman! The hotel has very strict policy in this matter! We will...I assure you. We will take steps immediately! Mr. Goodman, we will call the police! [cars honking] - [man] Get off the street! - [car honks] [tires screech] They're lying. These people are completely pathological. They took a half a year's rent from me and they said I never paid them. They evicted me, they slandered me, they totally destroyed my credit. They physically assaulted me. They threatened my life. And now this. These people are parasites. Florence. [sighs] I am so sorry... that you were even touched by any of this. Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed. When I first met you, I was enchanted and I... I was dazzled. I'm sorry. No, It's not like I can't prove they're lying. I gotta prove, they're lying. It's gonna take a little time. [sighs] I'll have to take them to court, I guess, but for right now it's my word against theirs, isn't it? [Carter] I don't know what these people want. You know that if they hadn't tied up my trust, I would never ask you for anything. But if the bail isn't paid, I can't get out of here, and I cannot prove to you, Sir. What I hope Florence already knows in her heart. At least I would hope that you know. Look... I'm just asking you to do... whatever it is your heart tells you to do.
