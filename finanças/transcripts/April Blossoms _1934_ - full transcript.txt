- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Oh, give me room to breathe, man, I'm not a woman. I'm sorry, sir. Dancing with the Archduchess required some wind, you know. Yes, sir. I have always heard that Her Highness was a good dancer. Good? She's a scorcher. Absolutely tireless. I shan't mind. That is... - If she'll dance with a mere subaltern. - If? My dear Rudy, she only keeps this regiment to supply herself with dancing partners. - Her Imperial Highness. - Late as usual! Yes, now we shall all be here until daybreak. Well, it's got to be fate. Carry on, Major! Attention, please. My lords, ladies and gentlemen. We are to be honored by the presence of our Colonel-in-Chief, Her Imperial Highness, the Archduchess Maria Victoria. Every officer will request the honor of dancing with Her Imperial Highness. The Colonel first, then myself, and the rest of you in order of seniority. - I've only one pair. - Oh, well I, uh... Your Highness, regimental custom permits me to ask for the honor of the first waltz. - Not the pleasure? - Your Highness. - Wili. - Hm? - What are they dancing? - The waltz. Quite the rage in Vienna now. But it won't last. Too flighty. But I can't dance a... waltz. Of course. You've been couped up in some outlandish garrison town. Yes, yes, but what shall I do? Look here, my lad, if you want to get on, learn it. In this regiment it's waltz for the duchess, or stay where you are. I don't know what you men are coming to. You've no spring tonight, Colonel. Your Grace, a little fatigue. Military exercises, you know. Let's have a look at your second in command. Your Highness. - Wili. - Hm? What? But you haven't time. She'll be down to us before you get back. Don't worry. This is the place, sir, if they haven't all gone to bed. Thanks. Wait here. Be off with you! Can't you see I'm asleep? Making a noise like... Oh, Your Excellency! - Can you teach me to waltz? - With pleasure, Your Excellency. - At noon tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Now! Tonight! In half an hour. - Tonight? - Yes! Certainly, sir. Vicki! Vicki! Wake, wake up. Wake up! - Hm? - A dancing lesson! - At this time of night? - Yes. Don't be absurd, Papa. Go to bed, you'll catch cold. Don't argue! Get up! Get a move on, you old fool! Never mind your trousers, I... Oh. I beg your pardon, I... I thought it was the dancing master. If you please, I'm his daughter. - I'm to dance with you. - Hm! Well, that is very satisfactory. Please, will you come in? Thank you. Your Excellency. Vicki, the gentleman's coat, help him, help him, help him. - Well, we are ready, Herr... - Count Von Hohenberg. Oh, Count Von Hohenberg. Please. Now, sir. The basis of the waltz is a step in three times. Just like this. One, two three. One, two three... One, two three. One, two three... One, two three... Got it? - Yes, sir. - Please, try it. One, two three... All right! - Papa, who's going to play? - Oh... how stupid of me. - Well, sir, I'm afraid we can't... - Who is that playing upstairs? - Oh, I'm afraid he wouldn't. - I'll pay him, of course. Oh, he thinks himself above it. A schoolmaster. A little bit klutz, you know. He fancies himself as a great composer. # Hark! hark! # # The lark at heaven's gate sings # # And Phoebus 'gins arise, # # His steeds to water at those springs # # On chalic'd flowers that lies # # On chalic'd flowers that lies # # And winking Mary-buds begin # # To ope their golden eyes # # With everything that pretty is # # My lady sweet, arise # # With everything that pretty is # # My lady sweet, arise # # Arise, arise # # My lady sweet, arise # # Arise, arise # # My lady sweet, arise. # Vicki! So late! Herr Schubert, Father said please will you come downstairs to play for a dancing lesson? - Dancing lesson? - Just for half an hour. No, Vicki, no, no. I only thought that... for my sake. For your sake? All right. May I see you again? - One, two three. - At one, at two, at three? - Tomorrow? - At one? At two? At three? At twelve? Midnight? Noon! What's the matter? Can't you keep time? And while we are out, we'll buy that dress. Hm-hmm. Well, you have had your half hour. You... you have learned very quickly. Thanks to... - To the excellence of my instruction. - Oh, please! Thank you, thank you. I take no fee. As you please. Don't forget. At twelve. You were not very polite to his excellency. Please, Papa, Herr Schubert's been very kind. You shouldn't have refused the money. They pay you so little for school mastering. I preferred not to. - Don't be silly, you'd earned it. - Hm. - I shall take what he promised. What was that? The white dress with the frills in the French shop near the Opera. - You are going to accept it? - Why not? All my life I've wanted a real silk dress. Anyway, what business is it of yours? It costs 60 florins. Imagine! Just for a little dancing. - For a little dancing? - Hm-hmm. Sixty florins. You dance very well for a second lieutenant. Your Highness! You might give your colonel a few lessons. I must speak to him about it. You Highness, I think... You must have given precious little time to soldiering. Why didn't you not tell me our new subaltern danced so well? The regiment needs men like him. He should go far. Allow me to add my congratulations. Second no longer, but first lieutenant Von Hohenberg. - You're not married? - No, Your Highness. We must arrange it. A quiet little baroness, perhaps. Don't you think so, Therese? - Well, I... - Speak up, child. Yes, Your Highness. Oh, Count Von Hohenberg. Baroness Therese Von Keffler. Meantime, in order to keep him out of mischief, he will join my personal staff. Don't be alarmed, young man, I'm old enough to be your mother. And I call on my adjutants for military duties only. Sixty florins! - Good morning, Frederick. - Ah, good morning to you. - You know my piano? - All the neighborhood knows it. - Would you care to buy it? - Buy it? Hm-hmm. For sixty florins. Well, I don't usually deal in pianos. - I will lend you the money. - No, no, no. I ask if you would like to buy my piano. How will you get along without it? Very well, I will buy it. And any time that you want... Oh, Fr?u M?ller! I am buying Herr Schubert's piano. And whenever he wants, he can come over and play on it. When there are no customers in the shop, that is. Who buys pictures of that old martinet nowadays? That old martinet was once the loveliest girl in Vienna. Wait. Oh, yes, she was lovely. I was her music teacher once. Thirty years ago. You never told me. I tried to forget. The little archduchess. In love with Frederick Lafont. But he was poor, a nobody. And they talked to her of her duty, her rank. One day I found at my lodgings a parcel of music. There was no letter with it, but it spoke as clearly as if she had said to me, I will never play again. And you gave up music for a memory? You wouldn't understand that, my dear Franz. But I was not a very... a very good musician. Now let me see. Sixty florins? Ten, twenty, thirty, forty... Fifty, sixty florins. Thank you, sir. Oh, will you put a note with it, sir? A note? Oh, yes, please. Pin it here, please. - Underneath? - Yes. - Will you take it with you, sir? - No, no, send it, please. - My pupils are waiting. Good day. - Good day. Hmm... very nice indeed. That young gentleman loses no time. - It is lovely, isn't it? - You have good taste, my dear. And so has His Excellency. Where are you off to? - To thank him, of course. - Vicki. Yes, Papa? You know, my dear, you would make a very neat little countess. Oh, Papa! Well, why not? Vicki Countess Von Hohenberg. Let's see, what would that make me? He's coming! And remember, when he says sit down, we keep standing. And then we all begin together. - Good morning, boys. - Good morning, Herr. Sit down. And what is all this? Your new song, sir. And who gave you permission to open my desk? Hm? You know it was wrong. Why did you do it? Because, sir, it would be so fine for marching to. - Marching? - Yes, sir. You know, in the woods. You promised that on the first spring day when the sun was shining... ...that you would take us to the woods. - Oh, I did? - Yes, sir. You rascals. Well, let's go! But I didn't buy the present. Honestly. Well then, you bought it dishonestly. - Really, Vicki, I... - Now, now. It was very kind of you. - It suits me, doesn't it? - Adorably. - But you see, I didn't... - I know, it dropped from the sky. Well, it sounds a nice place to hang itself on. I thank you very, very much. Anyhow, I like to hear you thanking me very, very much. Two of my regiment. And very pretty too. I thought Her Highness had paired him off with Therese. Well, if he can't manage two horses, he's no dragoon. When he gets tired of his little, um... charmer, I'll take her on with pleasure. Herr Schubert! Herr Schubert! Look! - Do you like it? - I adore it. Wasn't it nice of Rudy... Count Von Hohenberg, to buy it for me? He pretended to know nothing about it. I told him not to be silly. As though I didn't know. Isn't it lovely? Feel it. Real silk. He took me driving in the Prater. The trees were in blossom, the birds and the lilacs. A day of spring, the very sweet of the year. Oh, it was so beautiful. You should have seen his friends salute me. Just as though I were a countess. Heavens! Papa's dinner! Yes? - May I see you a moment, please? - Of course, of course, come in. What can I do for you? - It's about Vicki. - Yes? - Herr Wimpassinger. - Hm? - Vicki is young and beautiful. - Of course. One must forgive her if she's a little silly. - She hasn't quarreled with His Excellency? - No, no, no. What has she done? - Only gone driving with him. - Ahh... That's enough to set people talking, you understand. What concern is it of yours? - Herr Wimpassinger. - Hm? I have nothing to offer Vicki, only devotion. But I... I... Are you suggesting... she should marry you? Yes. No. I have other plans for Vicki. Thank you, Herr Schubert. But can you make my daughter a countess, a baroness, or perhaps a burgomaster or a burgomistress? You keep a wife? Why, you can't even keep a piano. When I am married to her, you shall see. No, no, no, no, no, no. I shall give a concert, make a name for myself, have a lot of money. Well, then perhaps. But in the meantime, shh, please. - Nothing to Vicki. - Well, well. - Not till after my concert. - If it is a success. - It shall be. - I hope so. - You doubt it? - Well... unknown. Listen, even Beethoven was unknown till he gave a concert. Beethoven is a great composer. I am a great composer. Maybe, but Beethoven has friends. I have friends. Friends, hm? Meyerhoffer. Good for nothing. And those other pot-house loafers. A lot of good they'll do you. I don't say his songs aren't pretty good, but no one will go to his concert, that's all. Don't be so cheerful, Meyerhoffer. It's very nice, but where is the audience? The por devil hasn't even got a piano now, just when he needs it most. Why, what's happened to it? He wouldn't tell me. Is Franz really serious about this concert? Once Franz Schubert gets an idea into his head, it sticks. - Hello, Hutten Bremmer! - Good morning! I'll bet you he says Franz is a genius within two minutes. - Good morning, everybody! - Good morning. No, no, no, no, don't sit there. We are keeping that seat for Franz. - Oh... - You can have my seat. - I'm going. - Thank you. - Good morning, everybody. - Good morning, Meyerhoffer. - So Franz is giving a concert. - To which no one will go. You wait and see. Franz is a genius! - Hello, Franz! - Waiter, bring some coffee, please. - I don't know about that. - I do. All Vienna is singing your songs. Listen. And whistling them too. Hey! Boy! Come over here. - Yes, sir? - That song you're whistling, who wrote it? I don't know. They all know your tunes, but no one cares who wrote them. That's why his concert will be a fiasco. You have to get a singer with a name. - A big name. - I mean to. Famous singers expect big money, you couldn't pay one. - Well, I shall persuade one. - How? With my music. Don't be ridiculous. If I sang for all the amateurs who come pestering me, I should do nothing else. I don't even know your name, Herr Schubert. I have no time to waste. Good afternoon. - But will you allow me to play it to you? - No, no, no. Sing at your concert! My dear friend, you must be imbecile. But madam, I had hoped your glorious soprano... My glorious soprano is reserved for the music of the imortals. When genius dies, I keep it alive. So that's how they treated you, eh? - The blockheads. - But what can I do? Never mind, Franz. They'll be sorry one day. - Anyway, we'll stand by you. - Of course we will. All of us, eh, Meyerhoffer? Thine is my heart and ever shall be dear, my dearest. There's devotion for you. - It's a new lyric. - It's beautiful. - May I have it? - If you like. It's no good to you now without a concert or a piano. "Thine is my heart and ever shall be dear, my dearest." Thine is my heart... Goodbye, Franz, and good music. - Goodbye - Goodbye. Good day, good day. - I'm just going to use my piano. - Oh, Herr Schubert, I'm very sorry. But you can't. Oh, Monsieur Lafont told me when there was nobody in the shop. Yes, yes, but it's gone. Gone? Oh... - But my new song. - He sold it, I think. I saw them taking it away. Sold it? - I see. - I'm very sorry. - There it is. - No, no, thank you. No matter. Thank you. Good day. Dear Lafont. He knew you would be happier here. Herr Schubert! Your piano's back! Vicki! Please, listen. # I throw my true love's name # # On stones in streams # # The glossy waters answer # # Through the breeze # # They cannot therefore know # # My true love's name # # And how for love # # My lyric is aflame # # No living thing but knows it's dear # # My dearest # # Thine is my heart # # Thine is my heart # # And ever shall be, shall be dear # # My dearest # # Alas, poor silly heart # # So you complain # # Your passion still possesses you in vain # # She does not hear # # Or hears and gives no heed # # --- # # Hear my confession still, oh dear # # My dearest. # Thine is my heart # # Thine is my heart # # And ever shall be, shall be dear # # My dearest # Well? Oh, Herr Schubert, it's lovely. - You like it, really? - Indeed I do. Then it shall be sung at my concert. I do hope your concert will be a success. If it is, I am going to ask someone to marry me. - I think it's time you did. - Do you mean that? Yes. You need someone to look after you. Dust on everything. Scraps of music on the wall. And your window hasn't been washed for ages. - I must fly! - Wait. Do you imagine she would look after things like that? Of course, that's what a woman's for. To look after things like that... ...if it's for someone she loves. Herr Schubert, I think a girl shouldn't wait too long either... ...before getting married. Don't you agree? - I do. - I'm glad, Herr Schubert. - Vicki! Then you... you... - Yes, yes, Herr Schubert! - Is our genius in? - Yes, he's upstairs. Vicki! Vicki! Franz! We have found you a singer! - Vogl has come back - Really? Yes. He was a sensation last season at the Dresden Opera. Dresden is not Vienna. No, but it's sometimes China. - And then sometimes cracked. - You're right. Dresden has no Franz Schubert. Vogl! Vogl! Do you remember the old days? One does not easily forget old friends, Franz. Franz's tunes will establish you here in Vienna. Not that you need it, of course. What's more, Herr Vogl, you will establish his beautiful tunes. - I shall be proud to sing them. - Good! - I'm delighted, delighted! - Come, let's hear your latest. # I throw my true love's name # # On stones in streams # # The glossy waters answer # # Through the breeze # # They cannot therefore know # # My true love's name # # And how for love # # My lyric is aflame # # No living thing but knows it's dear # # My dearest # # Thine is my heart # # Thine is my heart # # And ever shall be, shall be dear # # My dearest # Who had this grand idea? - I had. - I thought so. Have you sold all your tickets? I have sold exactly three. Nobody here has heard of Vogl. - No, but they're going to. - Yes, of Schubert too. - Schwindt is crazy. - Not a bit. A touch of romantic intrigue, that's the way to fetch them. And they'll get full value, won't they? - Who are you sending these to? - Everyone from A to Z. Well, it might work. And if you're clever, my friend, you'll lay in a stock of red roses. One of Schwindt's crazy ideas, eh? Vienna has more fools than I imagined. Well, they're here anyway, that's the main thing. And with Vogl singing, it will be a triumph for Franz. Vogl, Vogl, not dressed yet? Please, please, we shall be late. My throat. I can't sing a note. - What? - My voice. Gone. Oh... that's terrible. Terrible. I'm sorry, Franz. Sorry. Why, you're wearing a red rose too. - Everybody seems to be wearing one. - It's a hoax. Just a trick to get us here. Don't let's go in. Oh, well, now we're here we might as well see what this man Vogl is like. Very well. Here, please, sir. Thank you. - Is it all over? - Over? It hasn't started yet. - Have they come yet? - No, not yet. Well, I shall have to charge you for extra candles. If the concert doesn't start in five minutes, - There will be no concert. - What? What do you mean, Franz? Vogl is ill, he can't sing. - Don't joke! - But he's got to sing. It's impossible, his voice is gone. But the house is sold out. You can't disappoint the audience. Somebody must sing. - Franz, you must sing! - Me? - It's a good idea. - You've a good voice. - You've got to. - It's a chance, man, take it! It's you or nobody, Franz. Come on, come on, get your things. I regret to announce that Herr Vogl has been taken ill... ...and will be unable to appear this evening. Herr Schubert will sing his own songs instead. Ladies and gentlemen, I will sing Red Roses. Tricksters! We'll give you red roses! Quick! Get the police before there's a riot. Give him a chance! Please! Please, please quiet! Let's start again. We came for Vogl. # Rose upon the wayside blooms # # Sweet and red you take me # # Beauty is found for me alone # # Till your petal's newly sown # # In the dark forsake me # # Rose upon the summer bloom # # Sweet and red you'll take me # # Just a boy and now a rose # # Plucked me at your peril # # Not a nightingale that knows # # I was sown like a rose # # And like a swain I quarrel # # Just a little wayside rose # # Plucked me at your peril # # Rose, red rose, my hand is torn # # Folly goes lamenting # # In his hand a rose so alone # # In his hand is now a stone # # For a lad tormenting # # Rose, red rose, my hand is torn # # Folly goes lamenting # Well, what's the trouble here?

Ladies and gentlemen, if you would all do me the honor at my house. A little supper in celebration. - A toast! - Quiet, quiet! My friends. I rise... I rise... I will rise! Let us drink... let us drink... To a great composer! To Franz Schubert. Franz Schubert! Vicki! More wine!

Vicki. Herr Schubert! I'm happy tonight. - My concert was a success. - Oh, it was wonderful! Now you can get married. I'm so glad. If you are, then I am. And tomorrow you must look for a nice little home somewhere. Not too large, but spick and span. You will help me choose it? - Me? - Of course. We must choose it together. - But why me? - My dear Vicki. I see. Will you do me the honor of becoming my wife? But Herr Schubert... you didn't think... You didn't mean... Oh, how very stupid of me. Please, I'm so sorry. But I never thought for a moment. I see. It's the young officer. Has he asked you to marry him? No, we haven't talked of that yet. Vicki! Vicki! But I'm sure you're mistaken. He's not like the other officers. Rudy's different. Rudy is different. That kiss has lasted longer than the dance with the Archduchess. Excuse me sir, please. Uh? This, um... this gentleman insists on seeing you, Count Von Hohenberg. Where? Ah, the new genius! Have a drink. I should like to speak to you. Speak away, we are all friends here. No, no, no, alone... if you please. Alone? Excuse me, friends. I don't know, I'll find out. Well, here I am. - It's about Vicki. - Miss Wimpassinger. I have known her ever since she was a child and, um... And, um? Herr Von Hohenberg, are you going to marry her? Marry her! - Marry her? - Yes! Are you? I, um... Oh, what a droll idea. A dragoon marrying. Dear me, this is hardly the place for a... Some other time perhaps. - Are you going to marry her? - Remove your hand, please! Are you? No! Poor Vicki. You have every right to turn me out after my behavior. I came to apologize. I am ashamed of myself. And I came to give you an answer. You gave it. No, listen. I love Vicki. I would marry her tomorrow if I could. But our regiment has aristocratic rules. Her Highness expects me to marry a... title. A lady in waiting. And if you don't? And marry Vicki? I should have to resign. And, you see... I've never learned anything but soldiery. You should have considered that before. I know I should. But... I didn't. It will be easier to part now... than later. But that's... that's impossible. Don't you understand? You must tell Vicki the truth. And you must never see her again! Vicki! Herr Schubert, I heard you come in. I've been so upset all night. I... I didn't mean to hurt you. - No, no. - I really do like you. - But not the way I love... - Him. Yes. Rudy! Vicki! What are you doing here? Tell her. Vicki, would you marry me if I were not an officer? Even if I had to resign? Resign? Why? If I marry you, it means I shall have to leave my regiment. And the end of his career. Rudy, you mustn't. Now, now. You had better go. I can't. Vicki. I love you. And I love you too. Don't leave me ever. Ever. Herr Schubert, can't you help us? Perhaps, if I could talk to Her Highness. Rank is a religion to her. She wouldn't even begin to understand. Oh, yes. She would. She was once a girl like Vicki. Young and beautiful. And she was once in love. If I could go, if I could persuade her. So many people try to get an audience. I'm afraid you wouldn't even get past her undersecretary. - I will force a way to her. - No, wait, I have it! You remember when Herr Schwindt was arrested... ...for his caricature of the burgomaster? - Yes. - And demanded a hearing before him... ...and ended by painting his portrait for 300 florins? - But I don't understand... - I'll sing a caricature of the duchess. - What? - A lampoon. Especially composed for the occasion by Herr Schubert. - You will be arrested. - That's what I intend. And I shall demand to be brought before Her Highness. What do you think, Herr Schubert? Maybe Vicki's beauty and courage might touch her heart. And you will write the lampoon? I will try. # There is a duchess in the town # # Who though the stocks may rise or fall # # And though the state be up or down # # Or peace or battle be the call # # She lets the lot go hang who may # # So she can dance the night away # # She lets the lot go hang who may # # So she can dance the night away # # She lets the lot go hang who may # # So she can dance the night away # # She lets the lot go hang who may # # So she can dance the night away # # She grows in follies with the years # # And all her beauty is a ghost # # Vienna may be smiles or tears # # And beat the devil to the post # # She lets the lot go hang who may # # So she can dance the night away # # She lets the lot go hang who may # # So she can dance the night away # # She lets the lot go hang who may # # So she can dance the night away # # She lets the lot go hang who may # # So she can dance the night away # # I'll tell you what, my masters mine # # The dancing duchess has no care # # For such as you, come foul or fine # # Or how you're damned # # Or when or where # # She lets the lot go hang who may # # So she can dance... # Stop! Stop! - You're under arrest! - Thank you. Captain, please, she's my daughter. The child didn't know what she was singing. I did! She has insulted Her Highness the Archduchess! Franz Schubert, he wrote it. - There he is, that's the man to arrest. - Be quiet, Papa! She only sang it, but he wrote it. He'll write more, he's certain to do it. - You'll answer for this girl? - With my life, Your Excellency. I'm her father. Seize him. But I want to be arrested! Run away. Little girls should be in bed. - Now will you arrest me? - A dose of the slipper is what you need. Vicki, Vicki, Vicki, off with you! Are you responsible for this insulting ???. Yes, Captain. You shall pay for this! Captain of Police! - Herr Schubert! - You see, I'm busy. Herr Schubert! - Please? - This way! - Her Imperial Highness is waiting. - Ah! You stay here! My lorgnette, Therese! My snuff box. If they must write lampoons, why the devil can't they do it legibly? Here, what's it all about? Your Highness, I, er... I dare not read this libel to your face. Then read it to the wall. - Read it, Your Highness? - Well, sing it! Sing it. # There is a duchess in the town # # Who although stocks may rise or fall # Mercy, you'd better read it. Yes, Your Highness. "And peace or battle be the call" "She lets the lot go hang who may So she can dance the night away" "So she can dance the night away" That's enough! The penalty is five years, Your Highness. It should be ten. Ten, nothing. You made a mess of it. I like it. It has wit. - And that's what Vienna needs. - Exactly, that's what Vienna needs. Who's that? It's, er... it's the prisoner, Your Highness. The insolence! How dare he! How dare he! - Your Highness... - Mind your own business! Mind your own business! Stop strumming at once, do you hear? - At once, do you hear? - Wait outside, parrot! Parrot! Your Highness. Forgive me, please, I... Very well. Only I haven't allowed anyone to touch this piano for thirty years. Thirty years? So... On this piano you took lessons from Frederick Lafont? You know him? He's my friend. - Is he in Vienna? - Yes, Your Highness. Old and fat now, eh? With a wife and ten children, no doubt. No, Your Highness, he never married... ...either. So you don't approve of me dancing. On the contrary. I find it enchanting. - Indeed? - All princes should dance. It would mean less war. Then why did you write this rubbish? It was the only way to get an audience with Your Highness. Don't speak in circles. What about? I... we... Words are difficult. You had no difficuty finding words here! - You're not dumb, are you? - No, Your Highness. Well, speak up then. Say it, whistle it, sing it. But get on with it. May I play on your piano? It has been silent so long. Very well. # Once there was a lady fair # # A high-born maid was she # # So sweet and kind without a care # # Her heart was empty free # # Till love came along at last one day # # No gallant knight was he # # --- # # As modest as could be # # But each looked into the eyes of each # # Their hearts were all aflame # # Hers was a love beyond his reach # # And he still knows her name # # So soon enchanted days went by # # And never their love was told # # They parted away their hopeless tie # # Nor met as the years grew old # # The man he strove her hand to win # # But how was he to know # # Forever in her heart there lives # # The love of long ago # # Forever in her heart shall live # # Their love # # Of long ago # Very pretty.

Hasn't Therese taught you better manners? No... I mean, yes, Your Highness. Why the devil didn't you tell me? - I didn't ever think that... I mean, yes, Your Highness. You fool! I want you to marry Therese. But it's not Therese. Another? It's the daughter of a dancing master, Your Highness. Her name is Wimpassinger. Wimpassinger? How unpleasant. She would like to change it. And her Christian name is charming. Vicki. Victoria, the same as Your Highness. I don't like young men who intrigue behind my back. I'm sorry, but I knew how angry you would be. - Why should I be angry? - The rules of the regiment are strict. I make the rules for my regiment. Then you consent? Not at all! Who said I consented? You will marry the girl I choose, understand? Your Highness. # Thine is my heart # # Thine is my heart # # And ever shall be # # Shall be dear # # My dearest # - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
