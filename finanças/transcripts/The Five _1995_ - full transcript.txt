You're pissing me off. What the fuck...?! It's ringing. Your phone. It's ringing. Your mobile. Answer it or turn it off. I can't concentrate with it ringing. Shut up. I'll answer when I want. It's none of your fucking business. What? Did you say something? Did you say something?! Shithead. What did you say? What do you think I am? Hey, mister. Mister. Are you OK? - Don't touch me! - Did you hit your head? It keeps bleeding. Where are you going? I'll give you a lift. Chiba. I'll sue you. Oww. Hello. It's Daddy. Sorry it's so late. Have you finished your homework? Is Mum there? It's OK. Don't wake her up. I'm in Osaka. I don't think I'll be back for a while. Work's fine. Tell Mummy not to worry. Everything's fine. I see. Yes. Bye, then. Good night. Good night. Where now, then? They say "restructuring". Why can't they just say they're going to fire you? Nearly 20 years. Can't tell my family. Stay in a capsule hotel every night. 30 million yen mortgage, you see. What do you do? Nice car. You must be rich. You could hire me. Here's my CV. Please. This disco's shit. I'll never come here again. Thank you. - Hey! - Yes. Sorry to interrupt, but... What? What was that? We're closing now, sir. What? We're... Speak clearly, idiot! Why the face? Come up here and talk to me. Sir... ...violence is not permitted. - What? - I said no violence. Shut up, asshole! You fuck! Ouch! I'll handle it! This way. Come here. "Tcha! Tcha!" What the fuck's that? Hey! Get the customers out. You little shits! Hey! Come on. Over here. Let's dance. Lady, let's dance. Let's dance. You little shit. Fucking shit! Come on, calm down. - I'll shoot you through. - Not now. If I say I'll do something, I'll do it. That's enough. I see. What are you looking at? I didn't realize you were coming. If you'd called, I would've prepared the VIP room. There was no answer. I thought you'd disappeared. Sorry. I was trying to get loans. - Shut up! Take her away. - Yes, sir. OK. Come and see us tomorrow. The boss is angry. Young man, want to join us? Don't die too young. We're closed. Clean up. No-one saw anything. Yes, sir! My profound apologies. Please take this... - You've got the price wrong. - Sorry? You told them. You've got to pay for that. My insurance expired. I'll take it. It won't stop bleeding. My glasses... - Totsuka! - Sir! Call a taxi for him. Yes, sir. Help me up. Let me apologize again. You can rinse your mouth with this. I don't want apologies. Just pay. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Don't pretend. You took my driver's licence. So... Don't get the price wrong this time. I was going to send it back to you. How do I know you haven't told them anyway? Pay me. How much? All you've got. Young, esteemed Mikihiko Bandai is a really rich man! He built a great big house full of all his money. If you want. OK, I can pay you the money I owe the yakuza, if you like. What do you think? Cash. Sure. 10 million, minimum. 50 million. If we're lucky. What? I can't do it on my own. With three of us, I reckon we can do it. You, me and the ex-cop. The three of us, maybe... ...could get the money. Piece of cake. 100 million. You're very clever. What's on your mind? If you're this rich, why do you need to do that? You saw it! I'm in trouble. Don't suck my dick! If I do, you'll get a hard-on. Isn't that what you said? Will you do it, Mitsuya? Still want this stupid wallet, or...? You're not queer, are you? Don't misunderstand. I dress like this... ...to blackmail rich queer guys. I'm sweaty. I'm gonna have a shower. Where is it? Get some clean knickers for me. Ogoshi Talent Agency The disco guy's here. OK. Come in. This way. Over here. Stand up! Who do you think you're talking to? Get down. Get down on your knees when you talk to me. Bandai... because you haven't paid that 100 million yen back... the owner of the steel factory killed herself. I heard she was the president of your fan club when you were a singer. Are you human? I can't ignore people's suffering. You know what you're doing? Human beings don't do that kind of thing. Want to hang yourself? Huh? I'll help you. Ten days. Ten more days... Close the place. Run. It's like a kids' playground. No good for society either. - I... - Shut up! Stop it, Jimmy. What are you wearing?! Wear something a bit nicer. Idiot! The Thai girl Nami's done her job... and he says we should give her passport back. Don't you? The boss decided. Mind your own business. Watch the girls. Stop it! Idiots! Jimmy... ...I know. I'll talk to the boss. Take this. Get her a little dress. Mr. Bandai. Come here. Have you forgotten? Get down. On your knees. Show respect. "Pinky's" Ex-cop? Never heard of him. But this is Pinky's. You've got a reputation. Are you a cop? No. Where's the boss? - No men here? - You prefer men? Not really. Here you go. That's the bill. What? I only had one beer. You touched me. You had a beer. Where's your wallet? This place is a rip-off. Call the owner. Boss! This guy's weird. - Inside? - Boss! You fucked three girls, didn't you? No. Call the police. Trying to cheat us? Hizu, help! Hizu. We don't sell drugs! It's bullshit! You're ruining my business! I'm gonna arrest you for obstructing the law! Get out of the way! Hizu, I was worried... I thought you'd have weakened in jail. My work's dangerous. Join me. Hizu, the guy who told the press about you... ...was Ogoshi from the Goseikai clan. He did it to stop the story coming out about the gay politician. Ogoshi must have a hell of a lot of money in his office. You must know that. The key to the safe... ...you must know where it is. And guns - you must know where we can get them. The three of us can do it. You, me and another guy. Hizu! There's another weird customer here. Loads of them tonight! Call me. I'll wait. Their money's illegal, so they can't declare their losses. Business went bad after the bubble burst. So the yakuza took over. It's a familiar story, isn't it? The Mercedes, the brand-name suit... The press's favorite? He's just an amateur. Don't underestimate Ogoshi. How can we get in? Even if we do, it's a lion's den. Even if we made it, we'll be hunted down for life. The penalty's five million yen. You'll have to pay alimony to your ex-wife, too. Go hang yourself! I'll help you. OK? Hizu! Quick! Hey, come on. It's nothing bad. Wait. Ah, Sorry. You OK? Do you speak Japanese? Where's Jimmy? I'm looking for him. Don't worry... Police! Show me your passport. Wait. Stay here! Wait! Over there! - You go that way. - Yes, sir. Get in. Get in! Ouch. Here? What? Jimmy's here. I'm not interested. I'll pay in advance. Don't come in. It's dangerous. Let's be careful. It sounds too good to be true. Jimmy! I'm... sorry. This guy saved my life. Forget it! I work hard. Get out. It's dangerous. Want to live with her in Thailand? You'll need her passport. You can't come in! So much money. Hey! You! What did you say? What? I know all about it. Tomorrow's race. Tomorrow's race! Hey, you! Listen! You're crazy! - Listen. - I heard nothing. I didn't hear a thing. Nami. What? I didn't hear a thing. Shut him up or forget the plan. Decide. Another one? You want to play baseball with the yakuza? You dyed your fucking hair. What are the membership rules? Don't pity me. Typical Japanese. What's it gonna be? Fucking idiot! Well? Forget it. It's off. Are you OK? Jimmy? Hey, you... Come on, boy. Come on! Afraid of guns? Fucking punk! You were faking. Hizu, stop. You, that punk and me, that's enough. We don't need the blond boy. Why? Picking on the weak. Who is it? Come out! I heard. Poor politics. Eh, Mr. Bandai? Japanese men are no good! Well? That security camera is useless. It can't even see us back here! Jimmy's our inside man. He's transporting big money tonight. For a five million cut... ...he'll open that door. Once he gives us the signal... Once Jimmy gives that signal... ...that's when we make our move! Ski masks and guns... and we'll do the job! It's perfect. Finger off the trigger. Jimmy, do a good job. It's not opening. What's wrong? Calm down! You still owe money. None of your business. It's open. Not yet! - You're not one of us now. Get out! - Hey... What's going on? - Who let that stupid blond in on this? - Shut up! Don't come this way! We're all going to get killed! Start all over again? No Jimmy said they're collecting big money tonight. Where can we get in? Use me as a decoy. No! Don't. Step on it. I've brought the interest. It's my fault. Sorry. I'm in a hurry. That's not fair. Come in. Let me in. I was first. - Fuck off! - You can't let him in. Move! Let's go! Wait here! Good things come to those who wait! What's going on? Hand over the money! - The money! - Hell! Open the safe! Open the safe. Where are you from? Open the safe! Hands up! Hands up! Too bad. The key's at head office. Take this! There's a card key under the desk. What? Right? I'll count to five. Then I'll blow your boss' head off. One. - Two. - Boss? Stay calm. Three. Why be afraid of guns? We're yakuza. Wimps! Freeze! Stop! I understand! Don't shoot! Listen to me! Hold your fire! Hisamatsu! Leave it. There's a gun there, too. Hands up. Come here! Go! Hands up! Freeze! Go on. Kill me first. Or I'll hunt you down and kill you all. Understand? Don't move! Got it! Stand up! Hey. Is that your car? I told you not to park there. Who are you? Ah, sir. You're here. Nobody was here, so I let myself in. Go now! Help! I'll shoot you! Yeah! Go! Or be shot! Hands up! Down. Quick! Go. Shit! What's that face for? What? Give me a knife! - Where is it? - I'm sorry. Give me a knife! Calm down. How much? Over 100 million. Anyone hurt? Nomoto. I see. I've had a hard day. So when I get home, I'll need a bath right away. A lovely bath. Then dinner. Everything's OK. Mama cooks so well. Tell her. And... ...I've got a great souvenir, tell her. Really great. Anyway, I'll be back soon. See you. Bye-bye. Thank you for everything. I'll go to the country, to my parents' home. We'll visit my ancestors' tomb, the whole family, all four of us. I love to travel back home with my family. Best regards to Mr. Bandai. What's wrong? Best regards? You killed him. - Killed who? - You killed him. Do you think they'd just let Bandai go? Who killed whom? They're not stupid. If they kill him, they can't take over the bar. They're not stupid. I'm lucky. They gave me a suspended sentence. Nami. Jimmy! It's from you! Passport please. I'll take your ticket. I'm getting you a forged passport. Understand? It's a..."liar passport". We can leave here in, um... "15 days". You understand? So keep out of sight until we meet at the hot spring. We can go back to Thailand together. Look. Ticket! Passport! I told you. I can't go to Thailand. Here. It's all yours. You worked so hard. You sacrificed yourself. You deserve it. No! Let's go back together. Jimmy! Don't you like me? You lied to me! You lied! Nothing but lies! Lies! That's not true. I just want you to be really happy. That's all. Don't worry about me. "Together. We'll always be together." Lies! I don't need this! How did you get this? How did you get it? It's yours! Ogi gave it to me. He says it's the Japanese way of paying for sins. What does he mean? Let's get out. No! Quick! No! Nami! Shit. What am I doing here... Sir, do you want the back door... ...or would you prefer a blowjob? I'm trying. Trying to get you... ...a passport. We could both... ...go to Thailand. Won't you wait for me? Take this. So this from "My Ken?" So... which do you want? This is so wrong... Just stop. We'll have to keep the place open, or they'll suspect me. Well? I'll stay, for you. Who planned it? Nami's got nothing to do with it. Nammy? We'll let her go. Who planned it? Tell us! I'll crush your balls. Disco? Disco, eh? They're here. Must be about something else. It was only yesterday. Welcome. Sorry about last night. This way to the VIP room. Little prick. Creating all this mess. Where are the others? Bandai! Don't shoot. Come on. They're watching your car. Shithead! They're valuable. Treat them nice. We can sell them. You're always the one who takes responsibility. Why didn't they send us better help? Collecting articles about himself! Pleb! Hey. Look. This guy. It must be him. Right. Ogiwara. There were five of them. The ex-detective. - What was his name? - I couldn't get it. Hey! Get me more files! That's him. Detective Gets Two Year Prison Term For Gambling Those eyes. You fucker. What the hell? So you're still kicking. Don't fuck with me. What are you playing at? Our boss can't trust me, eh? I can kill those guys easily by myself. Who the fuck are they? Why do we need help from queers? You... You... killed... Nami. You... killed... Nami. Kazuma! I'm back. I forgot... I'm back. Papa worked so hard. I earned 30 million yen in one day. Do you see me differently now? Mama. Hiromi? Are you here? Play "For Elise" for me. Play for Papa. How much do you think I paid for that bloody piano? Mama! Bath and dinner! As usual. Where are you? What are you doing? I'm... I'll play. Listen. That's good. Very good! Mama! I come home from work, but my bath isn't even ready. I should never have married you. I had better choices. A tall guy from Tokyo University. Fuck you! I'm good when I want to be! Don't say I'm stupid and uneducated. I'm good when I have to be. You should be like Daddy. You have to be like me! There's really no place like home. I'm great... Really? Who are you? Did you kill her? No. Look, she's already rotten. Then quit starring already. If she's dead, she's fuckin' dead. Do you think he killed her? Who cares? I mean, how can parents kill their own children? Are you talking about me? Are you saying they could kill their bastard children? I didn't mean... You mean you don't know? Then what about my mum? Tell me. A concubine, wasn't she? So what? She was number three. He was the mayor. Are you taking the piss out of me? He raped her and you were born. So what? I'm sorry, I'll do anything. Forgive me, please. - Don't hit me! - Fucking idiot! Take off your clothes. Take them off! You're a great man. You stabbed the mayor when you were 13. So what? Your mother's great, too. She became a prostitute so she could raise you. So what? Idiot! Get them off! Am I really great? You're great. Tell me again. Am I really great? How great am I? You're really powerful. How powerful? Tell me! Tell me! How great am I? I forget... how'd that line go? I can't believe you'd forget it so fast! I just don't remember. - But I just told you. - I don't remember. "You need only be stronger than yourself." Don't tell me the rest, I'll remember it now. "Hey mister, can you teach me how to run faster?" Come on! You remembered. My ring size. It's nothing much. - Hey? - Hey! Listen to it. See if you like it. "Crimson Flower" Thank you. Can we start over? Miki is so happy, too. This time, I'll be... What kind of money is it? It's their way of thanking me for keeping quiet and going to jail. I finally collected it. What? I thought it was for a lady. Silly, if I had a girlfriend, I wouldn't risk my life for this kind of money. What kind? Mama. Pee-pee. OK. Let's go. Be quick. What's wrong? You're acting strange! Now, where's the bathroom? Ah! Over there. OK? Can you hold it? Shit! Gun's in the car. Let's go back to Daddy. - We've got to get out. - What's going on? What are you doing? Don't! - It's not what you think. - Let her go! Miki! We've got to get out. Calm down. Quickly! What's the hurry? We haven't paid. Where is everyone? Shh. Quick. I'll go in the back. - In front! - What's wrong? - Miki likes it in front, don't you? - Miki likes it in front! It's useless. Just a minute. Seats on the last bus only. - Reserve them. - We'll reserve them. Two adjacent seats. Bandai. That's right. B-A-N-D-A-I. Thanks. Why are we going by coach? We're rich. Let's take a cab. Or... we could go in this Bandai-style cruiser... ...across the sea! You're rather cheerful. This way, old man. Are you OK on your own? Come here. Mitsuya! Don't answer it. Who is it? Two tickets to Iida. 15A and B. Thank you. Mitsuya. Attention. The last bus to Matsumoto and Iida departs at 7.30pm... Thanks. Pee. Me, too. Now what? You told them. Hands out. Take your hands out! Family Of Four Slaughtered - Did you do it? - It was me. It's all my fault. It's what you call Japanese kindness. No! No! You're wrong! I said on the phone... You lost some money. All that money! How? Mitsuya! It's my share. I can't pay you back. What the fuck?! Have you got guns? We've got two. Fuck off! Two pros. Forget the sightseeing. Run. Far away. How do you know all this? It's not written anywhere. Together to the end. I've got something to take care of. You go ahead. - Where are you going? - Don't tell him! Gentlemen... ...we're not ready yet. Wait till your tickets have been checked. Iida. My mother's from there. I haven't told anyone else. That's far away. Hizu. Thanks. Attention, Bus #300 will be boarding in 10 minutes. Will all passengers please check their luggage. Some things never change. Like the view of the same old buildings out the bus window. It' II always look just like that, Mr. Bandai. But the city smells different this time. Something's different all right. You should go it alone from here. - Two beers. - OK. Oh! They still have these! Milk Candy This, too. Thank you very much. This is an old shop, isn't it? - 15 years? - We've been here 20. Ah, yes. I remember it. Thank you. Mitsuya! Bandai! Idiot. Ambulance. It's OK. Where? The two hitmen. One's down... I think. Shut the fuck up! Has he gone? The cops will be here soon. We can get away then. Give my money to my mother in Iida. She's ill. Asshole! Count to three and get out. Mitsuya. Count to three. No. Where are you going? I'm coming too. Together... Bandai. We've got no medical insurance, see? In this business... ...you have to pay a little extra. Kyoya... I understand that. But it's not up to me. Our lives are on the line. Those four aren't pros... ...but they've got guns. You said they were just amateurs. A man was shot dead last night at the west exit of Shinjuku bus station. The joint forces of national and local police report that... the style of the crime suggests the victim, Mikihiko Bandai... was killed by someone who was seeking personal revenge. It's also reported... that according to eye witnesses' statements... two men with guns were seen escaping from the scene... as well as a disco employee, Mr A, who is thought to have been with the victim. Police are also investigating other people connected with Mr. Bandai. Mr. Bandai has no money. Before he built his house of money... ...he was put to death. Shit. Where are you now? I can't even get revenge. So... ...forgive me. Who's there? Can you hear me? Answer me. I can't kill myself. Even though you're waiting, I can't. I'm sorry. I'm... ...so tired. I'm so sleepy. Goodbye. Hey. She's cute. How old is she? Four. Your wife is beautiful, too. Want some? Wonder what happened to Jimmy. The four of them... ...they're waiting for us there. Chasing after yesterday's dream Wandering around alone in the crowd again I miss the way I used to be Drowning my sorrow in sake While I drink and party by myself Time passes so quickly Rainbow-colored dreams Float and disappear On amber glass Hizu. Crimson flowers With all my thoughts I dedicated these love songs to him Where is my love gone? Where is it now? It's just another faded dream Smiling after suffering Time never comes back even if you regret I'm so tired... What's that? Check them out. Get out. Are you insane? You should've told me. The two hitmen? Upstairs. Hizu! Ogoshi! - Watch out! - Boss, I'm sorry. Don't go alone. Wait! Boss! Wait. Boss? Wait! Here. I'll give it to you! Want to play? Let's play together. Come on! Break it! Hizu. I told you to wait! The killers... Kazuma! Kazuma! Gun. I'm out of bullets. Brother... Brother, are you OK? Brother! Kazuma! I don't want to leave you! Kazuma! Idiots! Fucking idiots! It's a lovely day, isn't it? Welcome aboard. This is the express bus from Shinjuku to Iida. How could it rain... ...on us three beautiful women? In five minutes, we'll arrive at a service station. We'll stop for 20 minutes. Please don't be late for departure. We will depart at 5.30pm. Sorry. There was no beer. I'm worn out. Let's rest. That was delicious! Very good. Just the right amount. - What did you buy? - Horse meat. One, two... ...three, four...
