THE DELIGHTS OF THE WORLD These eggs aren't fresh. Yes, that's OK, like that. Hey, not so loud. I don't have the antibodies for that! I can't take any more! What about the chilli? Get out of here with that! Did you rob the Romanian embassy or something? I have appointment at Welfare. Your French is terrible. You must practise. They do tests now. I have an appointment at the Welfare Office. If you go to the Welfare, ask to see Sandra. She's fat like you, she'll understand. - And she's a Communist. - No, no! Irina can't take the metro with a crutch and that accent. She'll get arrested for being a beggar. If you go to the Welfare, avoid that bald one, Martine, she's a real bitch. How can you be so nasty? Have you seen her son? He's like Cynthia's son. Mixed race beauty my ass! He is ugly! Hi, Samia! Someone unplug Patience before I slap her! - Why did you do that? - Because you're doing my head in! - What's wrong? - Guess! The Job Centre offered me a cleaning job in Toulouse. - Toulouse? - Yeah, I said it wasn't far enough! No, don't throw it, I'll make a sauce with some rice. And Eun-Jo will have the rest for her spring rolls. See? She's happy. Did you make that? It looks nice. Sipra, I could hit you in self-defence! What is it? - You want rice? - No, the fire brigade! - You have to smile! - Yes, OK, I get it. - Hi, ladies. - Hello, Majid. I'm just bringing these keys for my mother. Thank you, my dear. Did you eat already? Yes, I did. Bye. Have nice day. - Bye, Majid. - Bye. My son is handsome. He's a professor of philosophy. Yes. To earn what? Like his dad? And your son? Is he still away on holiday? Let us know when he's allowed to come home, so we can hide. In any case, it's racism. Six months "holiday", just for two broken teeth. Sounds like my boyfriend. You know, he saw Joseph yesterday. He's been sent to the same beach. They play volleyball with hashish. It's still racism. She didn't get two months. I got two weeks for a scratch. - But you don't even work. - So? I need rest. I don't have a daughter, like you. If you can call that a daughter! I'm not going to lower myself to talk to you. You act like the boss but you're not. - Then who is the boss? - Nobody. Who is the president? Who had to find a woman from every community so the council would give us this place? Who is the president? - Who brought in Eun-Jo... - Yes? Sipra, Irina, and even a Breton woman, who died, poor thing. You forget all that. I hear you. You, president? You have all the qualities. Physically and mentally handicapped and black! Hey! Time out! Time out! That's enough! In any case, I'm going back to Algeria soon. We know, we're starting to lose hope! As soon as my husband gets his pension... Hallelujah! Because I've had it with all this, especially her. Do you take French people? Do I need a visa? What do you want? What is she doing in here? Do you want to die? - I have important news. - Spit it out, or you die. I'd like a chair, please. What are you doing? Go sit down. - Can I have some water? - And a snack? Yes, why not? The local council want to close this centre. - What? - You're joking? No, I'm not joking. Read it! OK, give it here! Oh, shit, shit! - You can't read? - I can. What are we going to do now? I knew it. Oh, dear Lord. 84 plus five makes... 84 plus five more makes 102, 102... And I have four here. 102 plus four makes 114. I don't know why I even open the fridge. It would be full if you started stealing yoghurts, you brat! Mum, why do we have a fridge? I think she's angry. We'll eat at Abdelkrim's house. You do that, and bring back something for your mother. - Have you bought food for tonight? - No. If you want shopping, get another wife, I'm not the right woman. I haven't finished counting. Close the door! I'm tired of this. That's right. You just keep doing nothing! You'll end up like your dad! In pris... on holiday! Life is tough! You need to wake up, do you hear me? Have you got anything to smoke? I really need to calm down. Are you OK? Yeah, great. So you're murdering people? Are they baddies? That's all right then. You're winning, son, that's good. Have you got a light? Don't worry. Why hasn't my mum come to collect me yet? Because you're naughty, and she wants to abandon you. And if you cry or tell, the devil will take you away. That's it, like that. There's no letter from the Social Security. Without the pension letter, we can't leave. I brought that from the centre. It's very good. It's Indian. Where are you going all dressed up? To the council. It's good they're renovating the estate, but if they think they can... We don't have to suffer to get back what's ours. Look at Irina. She looks like a beggar. - The costumes are strategic. - Yes, it's strategic. We represent successful integration. - What? Let me explain... - No, you don't talk. Especially if it's just to show off with all those long words you like. They don't like that. It's worse. We're just poor women, see? - Yes, you are. - She's right. Like Carnival! Karava, Kiriku and the Russian doll. Is this it? Haven't you got a kimono or just some chopsticks? Shit. Hello, miss. We've come to see the deputy mayor in charge of the council estate. OK, do you have an appointment? No, thank you. He wrote us a letter. - Appointments are made by phone. - Telephone? No, miss, it's a shame to waste credits. It's OK, we can wait here. OK, excuse me... Silence! We have put on our finest attire to show our dissatisfaction about the missive we received. Therefore... we hereby request without any further delay, a protocol agreement permitting those here present... What my colleague is trying to say is that we received your letter concerning our centre and, as you know, our association provides an important cultural exchange. We represent all nationalities. Even the most... We are a real Republican group. Essential to social harmony. To diversity. And if we are shut down, We could move... it would open the way for terrible acts of barbarism... We support this council's excellent work. Uprisings, throat slitting... We can work together. Ladies, you know the council is very supportive of your project, even if it was set up by the previous majority. But our new council policy means we now have to be a lot more careful about things like hygiene and safety. You can't shut down our association! I understand your emotion, madam, but, now you mention it, I'm sorry to tell you that you're not legal. When I look at the file, what do I see? When was the last general meeting held? When was that, madam? Never. No vote, no register, and no publication of accounts. I'm sorry, I can't help you. But those are only details, we can fix all that. The elections are coming up, and we can vote for you! Or not! Listen, ladies, what I'm saying is that, in the future, I hope we might be able to work something out together. Until then, ladies, I'm afraid you have to give back the centre. Asshole! I hope you die! Got to hell, you bastard! Fuck you! You're a bastard! Goodbye. I don't understand. Does this mean we have no more centre? That's almost certain, thanks to Bokassa here. I'm going back to Algeria anyway. Oh, look, the Mayor is coming to visit the estate on Saturday. Say again. Didn't you see it in the paper? The Mayoress is visiting the estate on Saturday. Since when do you read the newspaper? And why didn't you say before? Hey! Hey! What was that? I'll call the police! - We came to say goodbye. - I can't hear you! We just came to say goodbye. - I like the decoration. - Yes, it very tasteful. So you're leaving? Oh, no, it's you who is leaving. Didn't they tell you? She doesn't know, the poor thing. - Know what? - We went to the council. - They're closing your lodge. - A new space for bins. No, I don't believe you. It's amazing they didn't tell you. You think they would fire me? No, no. They said they like you. They're not firing you, it's just a transfer. The Rhododendron Estate. No, that place is all couscous and curry! They slaughter sheep for breakfast. I can't go there. To say "hello", it's "Salam alekoum". - That's pretty. What is it? - This is disgusting. They can't do this. I've been a faithful employee. A guardian of civilisation. And I can speak German, you know. I have a good accent. Then maybe you should go to Germany. Give me my cat. Don't be sad, Madame Flain. We like you. Would you like to talk to us? We can help each other out. Do you really like me? - Yes. - Yes. Without any doubt. - Could we do things together? - Yes. All right. Big stones. You throw them like this at the press. Repeat after me. Nice and loud. - Capitalists out! - Capitalists out! Revolution! - Bastards! - Bastards! Eat your biscuit. - Capitalist bastards! - Good. Nice and scary! - Rich bastards! - Rich bastards! We'll get you! We'll fuck you up! We'll get you! We'll fuck you up! That's very good. - Revolution! - Revolution! If you scream like that, they'll shit themselves for sure! - Revolution! - Good. Asshole! - Asshole! - Very good. Take this. Here. Next. Thank you for coming. This can't go on! They're driving me crazy! Come and see. That's enough now. Hello. Salam alekoum. Kids, huh. Fourth floor. Are you OK? Yes. Hello, hello. Welcome. Hello. Welcome. Welcome. Come in. - Say hello. - Hello. - My family. - Hello. - Work, work! Say hello. - Hello. Look at the state this country is in. Oh, dear Lord! The savages! Vive la France! Kitty! Enough now! This is unacceptable. This is an intolerable sabotage of public order in our community. Elizabeth... This way. - Are they going to cook that cat? - No, come with me. Come and see. I wanted to show you how people live here in the estate. They all live in the same appartment? Yes. See for yourself. Incredible! Worse than dogs in kennels! Worse than ants in ant hills! Worse than... lots of other animals! These conditions are inhuman and unhygienic! Do you think a lick of paint will be able to hide all this? No, no. We won't accept this. I tell you. Come and see. Mayoress Elizabeth Duprieux's visit saw tensions rise, and what should have been her re-election campaign turned into a fiasco. Help! We spoke to a local resident Madame Diminga Obenga. France cannot tolerate this any longer. And that is why I have decided to follow my conscience and become a candidate at the next elections! What? That dirty, no good, big-mouthed... Good morning, girls. How are you? Hello. "Welcome! Welcome!" "I'm going to faint. Help me Pierre-Michel!" "And that is why I've decided to stand at the elections!" OK, girls! Now it's war. We'll get our centre back and we'll shit on the deputy mayor! Twice! - We'll give them diarrhoea! - No. We won't accept this, I tell you. That's all very sweet, but why did Madame make her declaration without consulting us? She chose herself as candidate. That works in some countries. But this is France. That's all I wanted to say. She's right. We should vote. What for? I didn't hear. OK, let's vote. Who for? Samia? Me? No way! I'd rather die! - Eun-Jo? - Yes? Pity we don't understand what she says. Jocelyne! Jocelyne is over 100. Sipra, who can't talk in public without fainting. Poor little doll. - I'll do it. - Sit back down. Irina? Nobody can pronounce her surname. Tcherbinirvika. - What about yours? - My maiden name is Obenga. Obenga... Obama... Does that remind you of anything? It has a sense of history. I spoke to millions of TV viewers. People know me now. Oh, I forgot... Mounia. She'd be perfect! But, unfortunately, she isn't French. And she's leaving soon for the land of sheep. So shall we have a vote? - Who votes for Diminga? - Me, me, me! Don't worry. It will calm down. I should have recorded you: "No, Elizabeth." "I'll handle this problem." "They're harmless." I'm not at all worried by this. I know they spoiled your visit, but her announcement... That saves us. It's ridiculous. We don't have to do a thing. They'll self-destruct. OK, we'll see. How about a coffee? You think you can manage that? - No sugar? - No sugar! It's all you're good for. Who is the boss around here? I am. The girls have deliberated, and my candidacy has their unanimous approval. I'm going to stand at the local elections. - What? - Can you repeat that? I'm standing to become mayor of the town council. - I don't want to see this. - Sit down, son. - Aren't you proud of your mother? - No. - Yes, you are! - No, it's embarrassing. What? It's embarrassing? Dad, are you going to let her do this? - Do something. - Her photo will be everywhere. - Doesn't that bother you? - Yes, it does. - But I think it's a very good idea. - We'll be so embarrassed. - Your mother asked my opinion. - And you said yes? I agree with her. How are you going to do it? Right, who wants to take... OK, girls... Thank you, Madame Flain. And an American flag. Who wants to speak first? OK, I'll go first. Where shall we start? - We need to make a poster. - Put your hand up. We will now hear from Sipra. We need to make a poster. Before we make a poster, we need an electoral register. And we need to name a campaign leader. I'll do it, if you want. You're not French. Oh, yes, what a shame. Samia? No, I don't want to do it. I'd like Education. - I want Health! - What do you know? I have a First Aid badge. Yes, Patience? I want to be Justice minister. "Patience, Jus...tice." - Justice... - J-U-S-T... - Justice. - I-C-E. I want Culture. That's perfect for you, sister! Silence! Eun-Jo, what about you? Yes, exactly! What does that mean? She can work things out exactly. That's what she meant. OK, we'll give you the economy. You'll be perfect. I wanted the economy! No, Jocelyne. You're always asleep! You should be Minister for Beds and Cots... No, seriously. You can do Pensions! Pensions at 8 years old! You be quiet! - Who wants to take Sport? - Mounia? I forgot. She's not French. - Jocelyne! - Yes. Her idea of sport is bowling and pinball! What's wrong with that? That's enough! We need balance between our communities. The blacks that I know are all cleaners for the council. Yes, it's true. So we need quotas. I didn't want to say this, but we've felt the effects of global warming already. You disappoint me. We'll make you Environment Minister. Oh, no... I forgot. She isn't French. OK. Education: Samia. Justice: Patience. Economy: Eun-Jo. - Sport: Jocelyn. - Yeah. Health: Sipra. And Culture: Irina. - OK. Good. - Is that everything? Madame Flain will handle relations with the press because she's white and she speaks German. That's good to represent the team. It will be my pleasure to represent the team. Take it easy. - Don't you know how to write? - Yes, I do. And now for the poster! She looks like a fish. Think Martine Aubry. She's big too. - Or Rama Yade. - No, she's pretty. Leave it out, you lot. I think I look great. - Pari! Simone Veil. - Roselyne Bachelot. - No, Ségolène Royal. - Mitterrand! I think I look great. Yes, yes! Very good. - No! - Yes, that's not bad. I want to address the French people. Coluche! I'm going to slap you! Charles Bronson in a skirt. "Vive la France." - Yes! That's it! - I like that one. If you vote Diminga, you will all be Africans. This is OK, isn't it? We'll need a damn good photographer. Yeah, and a special effects guy. OK, I've figured it out! OK, is everybody here? It should be just the candidate. We voted on it. This is how it's going to be. One, two, three... Stop doing that! I can't see the others. Get back in line. We don't have much time. Hurry up. Here we go... Stop blocking out the others. Mounia, stop sulking. Smile! "Vive la France!" Never mind. Here we go! One, two... We should call the cops. Are they breaking the law? I don't know, but we can't confront them. I'd love to go kick their asses. We mustn't do anything. Listen. If we react, it will encourage them. All we have to do is remain courteous. Then find a solution. And finish all this, because it's starting to annoy me. What? Was there something else? - It's dynamic. - It's fun. - There's a half Mounia! - Very funny. We look great! I had you in the frame. I don't care. Now, we have to act fast. Put up the posters of King Kong to scare them, and we get our centre back. What did you say? You heard. - She said King Kong. - Quiet! It isn't a poster yet, it's just a photo. We need a party name and a slogan. It doesn't matter! All we want is the centre. We just need to scare them... The more credible we are the better. We already scared them. Look! But they haven't reacted. They're playing with us. We need a manifesto. What? Is there a hammer around here? OK! The manifesto... OK, we'll just have to ask people. All right, but hurry up before I kill somebody. Hello. Suggestions? Yes, I've got lots. Look after the obese. Nobody is happy being obese. Close youth prisons. They're like holiday camps. Legalise the weed. Free school meals. Free dentist. Free transport, otherwise you're stuck. In fact, free everything. I like you, but they're going to screw us over again. Your idea makes me laugh. We're going to be ridiculed again. Can't we have a serious representative? What diplomas has Diminga got? I wouldn't give her my mixer. You think you can just get elected? Go back to the kitchen! I have cancer, no job, and my son doesn't speak to me. What can you do for me? If you come in, I'll kill you! What do you think? I think it's... Fun. - Fun? - Yes, fun. You think it's funny? - No... - Why don't you do it? You studied, you know better than everyone! You can't just improvise. This is serious. And it won't change anything. There are global systems - which are beyond our... - So we can't do anything? No, I can explain it to you... You're just selfish. Calm down. It won't work. It's too complicated. It won't be easy. Have you only just realised? - Who are those guys? - You looking for a husband? Are you crazy? Never. No, over there. A black and an Arab, wearing suits. Are there any weddings on today? Let's check it out! Girls, girls. They're canvassers. They're looking for blacks and Arabs to support the mayor. What for? To weaken our movement. They give them suits and lighters. - The bastards. - It's amazing. They get a bonus for a black or an Arab. - The same price for both? - Not funny! This means they're worried. How dare they come here. I told you I was credible. It might be the end. We need to counter attack. We should take them on. "If you don't come to the fight..." No. "If you don't go to the..." How does it go? I don't know what you're talking about. You know that expression. - I don't follow you. - OK, let's go. I can't get up now. No, I can't. You go on. Vote Diminga! Diminga Obenga! Vote Diminga! Vote for Diminga! Hello, sir. How are you? Miss... Hello... Madam, vote for her. Hello, sir. Hello? Hello! What? Are you racist? - Hello. - Hello. Thank you. One euro fifty each. Oh, well, no thanks. Hello! - Hello, sir. - Hello, madam. You have lots of cheeses here! - Yes. - And it smells good! If this is a wind up, forget it. Not at all, I love cheese. Especially goat cheese like that. That's not goat, it's sheep's cheese. Vote Diminga. - Hello. - I really like meat. That's lucky. What can I get you? Nothing. I'm here campaigning. - So you're not here to shop? - Not exactly. Because I've decided to stop these privileges. Good luck then! Call me when it's done! I think I would like to try some of that delicious looking goat cheese. That isn't goat. It's sheep cheese. Pardon? Sheep's cheese. Very different. - Isn't that right? - Yes. Sheep's cheese. Bravo, Madame. Have we met? Diminga Obenga, the candidate. And you're campaigning on cheese, I see. I'm campaigning on real life. Interesting. Real life is a vast subject. How much is a kilo of tomatoes? Madame, I'm not going to go down this road... And a metro ticket? The cheapest school meal? Do you have my leaflet? Do you know what it's like to have an unemployed husband who has to beat you to feel like he's a man? Thank you, madam. And kids who hassle you to buy them Nikes? Or to feel like crap when you watch TV? Or to have worked for 30 years and not own a house, just a big TV to see your big head telling me things will get better! And you? Aren't you sick of being told what to do? Aren't you sick of waiting and complaining? Speak for yourself. I react. And what am I doing? - Does it help? - I get by. What's the point of everyone for himself? We could work together and keep warm. Are you better than the rest? No, but if we take a stand, we can look them in the eye. You'll pop less pills and we'll sort it out! Come! Join us! Take a leaflet! Vote for me, vote for you! Diminga Obenga! AND WHAT IF... - What else does it say? - I've read it 100 times. I didn't hear. It says you need a slap in the face. Shut up! Read this to me. "She is definitely not a conventional candidate "but she's caused a stir with her simple touching words "and her refreshing attitude to politics." Did the council call? No. You asked me 30 seconds ago. Did anybody come? Damn it, Mounia. No! But it's great, and it was your idea. Don't remind me! What are those idiots waiting for? - Who? - The council. We're losing it here. Relax, it's cool. People are even asking to join us. Can you write the address of the council? Mounia, can't you do it yourself? She can't write. I can write, but my wrist is hurting. And write "Danger" and "Warning" on it too. What is this? Did I ever ask your parents why they called you Patience? No. Thank you. Hello? Yes... It's the council. It's the council. Yes, madam. I say bravo. Bravo, Mr Deputy Mayor, for getting your ass kicked. And in public as well. Now we'll see her fat ugly face in the paper. Look at this! Shit! She'll be on the TV news next! You've got great vision! It will die down. Look, she's grotesque. She's like an ape. What do you propose? Do what they did in Mantes La Jolie. - Yes? - Go there. - Give out sacks of rice. - Rice? No! It'll cost us a business incubator or some crap. Or we employ youths from the estate. Send them in. Idiot. Don't touch my chair. Come in, ladies. Please, sit down. Hello. Right, what do you want? We want our centre. Your centre? Then you'll withdraw? Of course. In that case, we could perhaps consider... - And an appartment. - Pardon? - An appartment. - An appartment? Each. There are ten of us. You won't win, so take what you're given and count yourselves lucky. - And a driver. - Yes. And ten kilos of gold. A helicopter to go shopping. The Eiffel Tower. It's like that? It's that or nothing. Nothing it is then. The door is behind you. OK, we're out of here! Yes. "Out of here," as you people say. Is that how you talk in France? Come on, Mounia. Excuse us. I'm sorry. You should be, Madame. The leg is 15 percent invalidity. With both, it's 30 percent invalidity. It took me 20 years to prepare my wife for going home. I've had a house built, brick by brick, tile by tile. To live in with my wife. It has a new oven, self-cleaning, grill, rotisserie... Latest model. It's all ready. So listen to me. All I'm asking you to do is calm you wife! OK, Madame Mayoress, I'm ready. Not funny now, huh? - Mum isn't here. - I came to see you. I have some questions to ask you. Sit down, relax. I want you to explain politics to me. That's a big question. - Don't take me for a fool. - I'm not. You've studied, lots of important stuff. I don't see why we can't think too. All right. Politics is basically the organisation of the state. What is the state? No, I know. The state is the state. Yes. Society. OK, so in the state of nature... Ow! Out there, in nature, the big fish eats the small fish. - Correct. - No. - Yes. - Not in a society, no. - Really? - Otherwise it's just savagery. So we put rules in place. What rules? That depends. Rules according to certain ideals. Ow! Certain values. We make things fair so everyone can live together. That's it. I'm starting to understand. Then what? - What are you doing here? - Looking for you. - You've found me. - You OK? I'm fine. I need a rest. Can you help me? Not now. I'm not your wife! Look. Mum never does anything. Always on the sofa. That's enough! Let me be clear. I married your mother because I liked her! And she liked me! Say yes. - Yes. - Mum! - Tell the truth. - And today as well, I like her! If you kiss, I'm leaving. Flain, it's Samia. - Yes? - Who are those guys there? I don't know. Let's go and see. OK, OK. Switch that thing off. What are you doing? Painting these. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. All right then. Why didn't anyone tell us? - What colour? - Grey. - Oh, no. - Yes. No. Let us see it. - Yuck. - Who chose that colour? I don't know. Would you use that at home? - No. - You see? OK, pack it up. Who are you? We're the residents of the estate. We live here. Get lost. Come on, let's go. It's OK, you can leave all that. Thank you. Hurry up. They don't ask, they decide what's good for us. Some people have lived here 30 or 40 years! People here don't have work, so why use other people? That's going to change. The residents are taking charge! We're going to have a skills inventory, an exchange of services, so people communicate. Things are going to change around here. Bye. Hi, Samia. Why is the photocopier still not plugged in? Faster, Claudia. - What are you doing? - You want waffles or politics? Shall I read it for you? Yes, please. I don't have my glasses. "You will have success after success..." - Where were we? - The Liberals. Yes. For the Liberals, social justice is based on the idea of merit. That means, no matter where you start, if you're gifted and you work, you can make it to the top. It's good. - I don't like merit much. - Why not? Look at the caretaker's son. It's sad, but we'll grow old fast waiting for him to have an idea. A lot depends on your ability at the start. Eun-Jo's daughter does nothing, but she gets top marks in maths. But my son has to work hard. He does work hard. I swear. He does work. Majid, let me be honest with you, I like you, but that sheepish laugh of yours... No, do something! Stop that right now. I can't concentrate. OK, let's look at communism. Communism... José, don't lie to me and mess it up. If you break people's stuff, I'll torture you to set an example. No, my first job was as a plumber. - OK. And when are you free? - I'm free... I'm free all the time, all week long. - Can you start tomorrow? - Yes. - Great. Tomorrow morning. - OK. - Ten o'clock? - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... Can you fix a leak for Madame Graal? - No problem. - I'll tell her you're coming. I also do upholstery. - And wallpaper... - Like what you did at yours? - No thanks. - All paper... - No. Tiling? - Tiling, too, yes. And I've worked in security. No, José, I do the security. I'm security. But did I hear you say maintenance? Good evening, Mounia. Excuse me, sir! Quick, before it dries. No, you're not sticking it right. - It's doesn't stick. - Don't insult me! NAMES: JOSÉ I KNOW HOW TO DO: PLUMBING... I NEED: I AM FREE: EVERY DAY Madame Graal... Cooking... Repair... ...water leak! This is Mounia. And this is Madame Diminga. Patience, you manage the Madame Graal water leak file. Claudia and Jocelyn, you can go put up posters. - Irina, give out leaflets. - Again? No, you get a massage and leave it to us, right? With the certificate and papers for the NHS, OK? One more thing. Have a wash first, Madame Perrault, because people could die. - Understand? - No. You shut your big mouth. We're going to win! OK, Diminga, I think we've covered everything. What? Majid, what is happiness? Happiness? It depends. For the Ancients, happiness was tranquillity of the soul, no pain. - For Seneca... - Yes, Seneca. - You know Seneca now? - Of course. It is harmony with your own nature. Of course. For the Classics, it is freedom and, therefore, no work. Yes! - But the Greeks disagreed. - They did? Spinoza said that knowledge brings supreme happiness. - Right. - Thought and creativity. Very good! In Islam and Christianity, happiness is paradise. Now, everyone knows where to find happiness. And there is Maslow's pyramid. He says our first needs are eating and drinking. Then comes security, then the need to belong, then esteem or recognition. Then you can reach fulfilment. Fulfilment. Diminga, are you OK? Diminga! I'm so nervous. It's me. Will you be OK? - You scared me. - You'll be fine. Don't forget to get us up at the end. - OK. - You're a champion. Come on, it's time to go now. And now... Diminga! Excuse me, I have technical problems. Now it's working. - Go on. - Sorry... If I seem uncomfortable, it's because I'm not a professional. I'm like you. A simple citizen. I am like you, and yet I stand here in front of you, determined to represent you at the next elections, determined to change things with you! Our policy is homemade. We know little about politics, but we've decided to do things ourselves. Yes! Yes! They say we're not capable. And we're tired of complaining. We would like to move on. Do you agree? That's great! If you agree, that's great! It's time to roll up our sleeves, time to stop suffering and to stop complaining! It's time to take control, to talk, and to scream if we have to, but most of all, it's time to act! We need to stop being afraid of ourselves and to bring our great principles to life! To the sceptics, I say that hope and courage make the most beautiful victories. All together to happiness! Towards fulfilment! We are our own freedom! Let me tell you. I'm here! I'm with you! I am you! You are Diminga! Let us be fulfilled! Let us be fulfilled! Let us be fulfilled! Samia, do something! I'll get her down. Play some music! Right, I'm going to Algeria. When are the elections? The 21st. Why? So all this can stop. So you think I will lose, and everything will be like before? You're wrong! Didn't you see me? People applauded, Lexou! They all stood up! Let's look now at the campaigns for the coming local election. A new life has started for me. This is only the beginning. My children are grown up, they don't need me now. Those were the words of the local phenomenon Diminga Obenga, before her meeting in the Jacques Prévert gym. In other news, we have the amazing story of a parrot in Connecticut which could be the reincarnation of Michael Jackson... Diminga, if you're not happy at home, you can leave. Nobody is holding you prisoner. Hello. Hello. It was so funny! You should have seen it! Yes, let's have a laugh and "let us be fulfilled!" She's a spicy character. Yes, as you say, she's spicy. Interesting, but, politically, so weak that there is no substance in her policies. Nothing to worry the current Mayoress, as Madame Diminga Obenga only has 2% of votes in her town. And it's unlikely to go up after this. Yes, that's not likely. It wasn't that bad. Hey! Wake up! OK, OK, I'm coming. Open the window! Come quick! What's wrong with your ears? - Calm down. - Come quick! - Hurry up! - Why? The council called back! Come on! - OK, I'm coming. - Hurry up! After all we've been through. We don't know what they'll say. She's probably wants us for an international tour. I bet it was the cowboy music that did it. Didn't the Algerians want you back? I couldn't miss you at the Olympia. Can you spell that? "O-L..." Stop it now. It isn't constructive. Are you constructive? Where's your "nuniform" today? I'm going to slap her! Missed. We don't say "nuniform", it's "uniform". U-ni-form. Hello. Ladies. My friends, my comrades... Please do come in. It was super last night. As you see, my deputy also liked it a lot. Please have a seat, make yourselves at home. Get a throne for Madame Thingy. Are you OK? You look terrible. That's it. I won't beat around the bush, we've found you that kilo of gold. No, I'm joking. Do you still want your centre? However, if I help you, you have to help me. And therefore... You withdraw from the list. What's more, you've created quite a stir, and that interests me. So, as the cherry on the cake, you're going to support me. With real passion. What do you think? Who will be on the poster, you or me? On the poster? Isn't she sweet? So sweet. She's really sweet. I love you. I love you. Shit. See you around. Lexou. Lexou. You can tell them. - Go on, Diminga. - No, you. It's always me! So... The council suggests we withdraw from the list and we support them. In exchange we can keep the centre. We wanted to tell you that we're sorry. It's our fault. We got you into all this madness. And maybe we got a bit carried away. Yes, we did. It doesn't matter. At least we keep the centre. Stop everything? What for? Are you joking? I mean... Fuck off! We don't care! We don't care! SCREW THE COUNCIL - Come on, Samia. - No, I don't vote. Vote. Did you vote? Very good. Go on. Go on. Don't be scared, go to your friend. Watch out! You're squashing me. Algeria is my home. I respect you, but I don't love you. But I respect you. If you want to leave, I don't mind. If you want to stay, I also don't mind. That's all I had to tell you. When you speak in French, I don't understand a word. Give me a kiss. Don't, Mum! A kiss, or you can sleep outside under the bus shelter. And it's raining. Give your mother a kiss. Come on, cute little ears. Little ears that I made. Incredible. Welcome to this election day special. Here for the next three hours, we'll hear from the key players in this election. Polling stations closed an hour ago and the count has begun. We're expecting the first estimations very soon, and we are expecting a few surprises. Six percent! Six percent! Six percent! Can you believe it? - Out of 100,000 how many is that? - 6000. - 6000, yeah! - 6000 people voted for us? Six thousand! Six thousand! Six thousand! Samia, where are you going? I have to get up tomorrow, to take all your kids to a stupid water park. Hey, José Bové, come and sit down. José Bové? Did you call me José Bové? It's nice here, isn't it? Come on, we don't care. Yeah. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
