I am not here for vengeance, but to gather, with a loving heart, those willing to join in the betterment of the Nation. Seeing the representatives of all Romanians, from Nistru to Tisa, from Hotin to the sea, from Boian to Vatra Dornei, from Sătmar to Săcele, I think with respect of the 800.000 dead in Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia, who, with their blood, have forever cemented the unification of the Country. Let us all work together for our dearest possession: our Country. Romanians all over, join your thoughts and hearts! Forward, to our labour! THE DEAD NATION - fragments of parallel lives - Long live our King, In peace and honour, He is our country's banner, For him with joy we sing! May he lead us ahead May his fame always spread For victory in wars!... In the '30s, photographer Costică Acsinte opens his own studio, "Foto Splendid", in South-Eastern Romania. Our Legion proud By oath is bound The price in blood to pay. The sacrifices made, The strength of blades Will lead to our victory day! Dear heroes watch over us, Guiding the Legion on its way. A brave death is all we want, For it to Them we pray. At the end of 1937, in Bucharest, Dr. Emil Dorian starts keeping a journal. December 30th. A bolt from the blue: Goga is now Prime Minister. No one expected it. The Jews are expecting disaster. We see the fruits of anti-Semitic nationalism, supported for years by all the parties. Goga will enforce his racist convictions. Several newspapers were closed because Goga wanted vengeance. The collapse is general. People expect the same measures introduced by Hitler in Germany. January 6th. A sad observation: People don't need freedom. It makes them sterile. But collective discipline gives them peace. January 14th. It finally happened: I was fired from Social Insurance for being a Jew. Newspapers boys announce: "No More Jewish Doctors in Insurance!" Victory is theirs, nationalism has won. I took it rather calmly. I'd have preferred fewer calls of sympathy. January 25th. The TB Hospital has a single Jewish patient. Prompted by an employee of the Universul newspaper, the Christian patients petitioned for the Jew to be thrown out. The most insulting measure against Jews is the reappraisal of citizenship. The Jews shouldn't accept it. Citizenship is definitive. How inept, to reconsider such an act, which has created enduring identities! One million people are slapped in the face, forced to travel all over the country for documents, and to accept the 20-day deadline. If I knew my family was safe, I would refuse to go. What is the value of citizenship if any Minister can suspend it? Our King has given an interview. He was very honest. He assures that there will be no pogrom, but Jews could make it easier by leaving Romania willingly. August 15th. 22 years ago today, the waters of an age were parted. I crossed a country at war. I was torn between poetry and reality. I couldn't overcome an adolescence of deprivation. Those events still echo inside me. What became of the orphaned nurse who swore she would kill the man who starts the next war? Or the sick peasant who shouted: "I'll stab the man who sent Dad off to die!" Or the wounded magistrate who moaned: "Doctor, the Country is sacred, but my life is more sacred!" "Kill me if the Country couldn't!" And that Bavarian boy, who, after days of starving, when asked for information on the German troops, screamed: "For bread I'll sell my country and the Emperor!" And others I met at the crossroads of tears, hunger, blood and death. How to live with these memories for 25 years, while criminals plan those horrors again? My daughters are dancing in the next room, while on the radio a girl has announced all the horrors of death from all over the world. November 30th. New events confirm the rumours about synagogues burning across the country. Yesterday's assassination of a University Rector, the bombing of a Jewish play in a theatre and the shooting of Codreanu and other Legionnaires (fascists). Officially, they tried to escape and were all shot to death because of the fog. It's still the Jews who worry most about the future. Tragic experience has taught them they must be the scapegoats. You fight bravely For our goal To end our country's misery! Free us poor peasants From our toils and misery, For dirty Jews and thieves Suck our lifeblood ceaselessly. January 2nd. Historian Iorga gives statistics of doctors' ethnicities, concluding that Jewish doctors are more numerous. We still have too few doctors for the country's needs. Fire them, hang them! Fine. What I find criminal is his claim that Romania's sanitary situation is caused by the Jewish doctors. People with common sense know this is abominable. But the others... Things are progressing fast. Now there's a single, Fascist Party and it will run for Parliament. They have a uniform:, the Roman salute is now obligatory. The rest will follow. September 1st. The war has started. Hitler has attacked Poland and annexed Danzig. Death is getting close. People were fine with the murders in China - it was all so far. September 21st. Legionnaires (fascists) have shot the Prime Minister. It was announced on the radio, probably by a Legionnaire who had entered by force. September 24th. Arrests and executions. There were many more executions than announced. Dead Legionnaires were exposed in public squares. In Bucharest people flocked to see the bodies exposed where the Prime Minister was murdered. A girl I know asked her father, instead of icecream, to let her see the bodies. December 31st. All hearts tremble, less for the past, than for the next year. The cheap emotion of tradition turns dramatic. This time, "What next?" truly echoes in our hearts. What next? I warmly wish my country, as is the habit, "Happy New Year!" Good tidings! June 28th. History is getting closer. Lightning has struck: the Soviet demand Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. Germany and Italy don't support us. The Crown Council accepted Russia's demands. A minute of silence leaves our country breathless at the supreme moment when Bessarabia is ripped from its body. In the land stolen from us, sons of Judas whom we raised too kindly rejoice in the streets. See them laugh, while the Motherland bleeds! June 30th. Jews are increasingly resented. People say they welcomed the Russians in Bukovina and Bessarabia. The radio in Rome spreads huge lies. They claimed 3.000 Jews manifested at the Soviet embassy convincing the Russians to ask for Bessarabia. Now they claim Bukovinan Jews threw stones at withdrawing Romanian soldiers. The scapegoat hunt begins. Today, Jewish students of Medicine were prevented from taking their exams. July 16th. There are unbelievable rumours of crimes on trains. The soldiers' pogrom against their comrades seems inexplicable. We know what happened during the retreat from Bessarabia and Bukovina. Formerly persecuted Communists and withdrawing soldiers caused destruction, and the remaining population may have acted violently. This is all common in exceptional times. I can understand soldiers acting cruelly out of frustration. But killing Jews like dogs in a peaceful Romanian town is an act of unimaginable savagery. But let's say, in some village full of poor Jews, recent vexations led to serious deeds. How to explain cold-blooded murder against loyal Jewish military men? How can a soldier throw his comrade out of a running train? These aren't some wild boys having fun ripping dirty Jewish beards. This is the assassination of innocent people, though offended by the law, soon to face starvation. How can they still conscript Jewish soldiers? Is it cynicism, or a trap to carry out the massacre? August 1st. Today I lost my last means of survival. The bank whose physician I was fired me, citing national reorganisation. I only had 15 days' warning. August 9th. Many Christians don't understand the Jews' humiliation as new pariahs. Lovinescu told me the law was "liberal and fair". Only a poet married to a Jew told me today: "What does Hitler have against you all?" "He asks any friendly country to give you grief." The Jews already tell jokes about their wretched destiny. One goes: Christians have 3 new ways to address us- "Mr. dirty Jew", "You dirty Jew", and "Fuck off, dirty Jew", by the 3 categories of Jews defined by the law. August 21st. Is no one ashamed to read the recent speeches of H. O. Roth and the Minister of Propaganda? The Saxon dared rebuke the country in the name of the German minority, and the Romanian Minister answered humbly: "Germans here are on par with the Romanians." September 15th. Romania is now a Legionnaire state! Many MPs are Legionnaires: Horia Sima rules the Council of Ministers. The Legion is the only recognised political movement, meant "to improve Romania's morals and creative powers". Gen. Antonescu is the head of the Legionnaire regime. September 30th. The Medical College has excluded all Jewish doctors. Now they can only treat Jews, while Christian doctors can treat anyone, because the Legionnaire principle says to take money from Jews, but never give them any. October 8th. The latest events: Great Legionnaire manifestation; German troops in the country. Antonescu is wrong to put on the fascist Green Shirt. Gen. Antonescu now wears the Green Shirt! In his soul, he has worn it for a long time. Long live Gen. Antonescu! Since we are of the same mind, I ask you, Legionnaires, to follow me, before the Heavens, in reciting your oath: For the Captain and for our Nation, before the King and the General, we pledge to lay down our life to create a people and a country like the holy Sun in the sky! October 22nd. The weariness of years boils over like a powerless cry. It sometimes weighs on me, in a world of merciless disaster. So much darkness in this hateful century. No wonder destructions will follow. In the week of mystical exaltation celebrating the Legionnaire Captain as a saint, Emil Cioran stated on the radio that, between Romania and the Captain, he would have chosen the Captain in a blink. There were also executions: Prof. Iorga, Madgearu, Iamandi, Gen. Argeșanu, and about 65 other political prisoners. Legionnaire youth, so sacred, Souls pure as snow, steely limbs, Wild and free like winds in April, Thoughts as clear as mountain springs. Our hands lift forever skyward The new century's pure bud, Raised with rock, fire, water's power, Cemented with Dacian blood! The Guard and the Captain Turn us into hawks of iron, The Country, the Captain, And the Archangel Michael! December 25th. Christmas. Wilted, sterile. No book. Can't write a single line. Huge snow, blocked roads. I'm so numb I can hardly write this. Legionnaire death, weapon in our hand, Is to us the dearest of all brides, For the Cross and for our motherland We level mountains, stand against the tide. We're afraid of no tormentor dungeon, Any enemy we can defy. Even struck down by an evil truncheon, Still, for our Captain we will gladly die. January 24th. There was almost civil war. Gen. Antonescu has explained: The Legionnaires tried to take the power. What happened in the Văcărești area cannot be described. So many Jews were executed by armed Legionnaires. Dozens of Jewish bodies were found on the road. A merchant had his nose and arms broken, then he was shot. An old rabbi's two boys were killed in his arms, another had his tongue and eyes cut out. Jews were hung in the slaughterhouse hooks, some were thrown in the sewage or on the streets. Two bodies were identified by a patient of mine. More bodies were kept outside the morgue, in the snow. They keep identifying more. People crowd the riverbanks by the morgue. When they meet, people tell of more crimes. As for torture and beatings, the list is infinite: Jews forced to drink petrol, crosses cut into their backs, beatings and killings by women... February 2nd. Radio news on the 92 Jews killed in Jilava: Human cruelty has never been so ferocious. As in other cases, some of the murdering monsters were women. Ilie Rădulescu candidly denies our country's bad reputation caused by the pogrom. More horrible details are revealed. Among themselves, the Jews speak only of the tragedy. They are still dazed, as if drugged. I didn't speak much with Christians: Sonia is ashamed and thunders against her people, of which she says that it doesn't deserve a state. March 28th. Jewish urban properties are now confiscated. Even poor people felt the emotion caused by this mass confiscation of Jewish houses. Some worked hard all their life to afford a home. Others have only a shack and they will lose it. The houses will be given to Christian attorneys, clerks, doctors... This is justified through Christianism and Nationalism. It's hopelessly sad and absurd. Romanian soldiers have celebrated Easter by our Christian custom. German officers and soldiers were greeted with love. - Christ is risen! - Indeed he is risen! The visitors were impressed with our religious rituals and the monument's grand architecture. Then they visited the church where they saw the religious relics of our past. Germans and Romanians together celebrated the birthday of Chancellor Hitler, the great ruler of the destinies of all Germans. June 22nd, 1941. The Leader has ordered: "Soldiers, cross the Prut River!" "Crush the enemy to the East and North!" "Free our brothers from the Red yoke of Bolshevism." "Make the country's body whole again, with ancient Bessarabia and Bukovina!" People kneel all across our free country and thank God. The country is back on the track of its great destiny. Enthusiastically, on the first day of war against Bolshevik barbarity, the crowd cheers fervently for the Reich and its Führer Adolf Hitler! August 11th. Hatred against Jews is frantic. After the executions in Iași, far exceeding the official version, Jews were evacuated from Moldovan towns in closed wagons, dying horribly of thirst and suffocation. Tragic details keep pouring in. The train station scenes with miserable souls in sealed wagons, which no one could approach, exceed any sadistic fantasy. Hundreds of people in cattle wagons, drinking each other's urine, screaming until they died, exhausted. There were scenes of utter madness: a man paid 20.000 Lei for a glass of water. Others offered their jewelry for a sip. The survivors will end up in the camps. Like ancient rulers who, before battle, bowed to God in praise, Gen. Antonescu, his Staff and German officers kneeled in an old church and prayed for victory against the barbarians. The fearless Romanian army has crushed the absurd borders imposed on us by Bolshevik greed. Our advance into Bukovina is unstoppable. Gen. Antonescu's army is so brave! August 13th. Recent events have shaken me. I am terrified because I can't earn my bread. I keep thinking of death. An immense weariness rises in me, muscles sore from the manual labour I'm reduced to. Everything seems dried up, devoid of sense. Maybe this is the best time to end it all. Romanian troops marched again where, in 1918, we affirmed our rule over Bessarabia. August 16th. For the second time, I stopped writing here. It feels like I've lived 20 years of life since. A young man came back from forced labour with a bad injury, was rejected by Christian doctors for being a dirty Jew, had his bandage opened and was thrown out bleeding. Then a family of Jews was drowned. In between, a long string of disasters. Without radio or phone, I note how we are humiliated, empoverished, and now forced to wear a yellow star. Then all Jews from Bessarabia and Bukovina were sent to Transnistria. Towns were deserted within days. Old people, women and children left into the unknown. When will we, in Bucharest, follow? October 20th. Odessa was conquered by Romania. "We've traded Cluj for Odessa," someone said. Newspapers say Romanian soldiers were warmly greeted then speak of fighting in the streets. With spontaneous enthusiasm, people everywhere cheered for our glorious army, for the King, our Leader, and our great allies. They cheer for the Head of our State, glorious Marshal Antonescu. November 14th. We still fear deportation to Ukraine. All Jews are obsessed with it every moment. Nothing is absurd anymore. News from Jews deported to Transnistria are ghastly. Walking in the rain, women and girls raped, starvation, suicides... Benador looks scarily decomposed. Gutted by the fear of Bucharest Jews being evacuated, he was scandalised by two Jews amused by a funny story. How can Jews still laugh? In honour of the German Führer and of the Duke of Fascism, two squares have been named Hitler Sq. and Mussolini Sq. December 10th. Mihai Ralea is what passes for a Democrat here: amenable, adapting to any form of government which allows him a political career. We spoke to him of the Romanian people, but he said: "Nothing can be done now. We've assassinated 200.000 women and children." He gave us details on the killings in Bessarabia and Bukovina. Women set on fire, 100 children buried to the neck, then shot, Jews made to stand on a table in a canteen, then hanged by the ceiling. Our ruling Marshal visited Transnistria, where the Romanian administration has a programme to rebuild this region, so harmed by the Bolshevik rule. December 31st. Without exaggeration, this year has felt like ten. Legionnaire mass killings and now when, as Hitler solemnly promised, the war should be over, our year was full of blood, terror and despair. Hard times for one who looks around objectively, trying to reconcile it all with one's thoughts. Marshal Antonescu evokes our tradition of compassion: "The orphans and the poor await our Christian mercy." "We can only grow by strengthening our race," "and we cannot build our race on poverty." January 25th. Of course Jews, whom the State uses for all hard labour, should be called to shovel snow. They set out with shovels, at -31 degrees. The frostbite hit right away. I treated many frozen ears. Jews are so downtrodden that you must be happy to live here, any way, and not across the Dniester, where hundreds starve to death daily. News from there is horrible:, I constantly think of those people, when eating or writing, with sterile powerlessness and mute anger. What of the rest of us? We know that deportation is being considered again. February 16th. The news say that a large company is testing a new lethal gas. The subjects were 400 young Jews from a labour camp. They all died. In the U.S., Thomas Mann blamed it on the whole German people: they could have prevented their leaders from committing this. This cold murder - in the Netherlands - seems worse than machinegunning innocent children, or Jews of all ages dying of thirst in sealed wagons, or burning, covered in petrol. Then you are silent again, going through the mud of tomorrow, through deaths by starvation in Greece, and so on, in this endless season, whose days are grey, cold, bloodstained. June 7th. I hear someone was ordered to shoot children in a truck, in Bessarabia. He refused: "No, they're children. If they were dirty Jews, I'd be glad to." The children, who were in fact Jews, were saved thanks to this "charitable" man. June 29th. Jews in Chernowitz are being deported. On Sundays they can't leave their homes. That's when the authorities strike, street after street. Sirens blare to cover the poor souls' desperate cries. They are loaded into cattle wagons, and thrown some bread and water. There are piles of their goods all over town. Everyone buys them, even if they don't condone these barbarities. Since they're so cheap! The Governor of Transnistria and other officials attended a solemn event at the Heroes' Cemetery in Odessa. The head of the Orthodox mission in Transnistria, officiated a commemorative service. Everyone was reminded of the Romanian army's heroic deeds here. Let us take the oath spoken by our Marshal: "Before these graves, I swear that I trust in our victory" "and vow to fight harder, for the honour and freedom of all Romanians!" August 2nd. Maize is rationed too: 1,5 kilos a week. Jews don't get any, though. It's the first basic foodstuff which they are denied. For sugar, they get half or 1/3 of a ration. But maize meal must be a national dish, subject to ethical prohibition. August 10th. Galaction entered the German-Romanian Association. Other writers repeatedly refused invitations. Many were disappointed, thinking the good priest was all neutral. During the snow-shovelling, he passed by some young Jews, took a shovel and worked with them for a few moments, as a symbolic protest. So, the good priest acted the good part again. August 19th. The Romanianisation Centre keeps confiscating Jewish homes. New tenants are brought in. Christian tenants will move from uncomfortable houses to good ones, while Jews will move to shabby, expensive houses. A captain went to see the Jewish house he would rent. The owner asked him to come later, at the hour established by the Romanianisation Centre. The captain grabbed him: "I can shoot you like a dog! I killed 50 like you in Odessa!" September 8th. The Jews locked up in Bucharest schools were sent out. Witnesses say it was horrible. Screams filled the street. Passers-by threw them cigarettes and money. Children wouldn't get on, those left behind had to be pulled away. They disinfect the schools, then it's all forgotten. September 15th. A funny one while waiting in line: "So our children die on the front to get Jews a country in Transnistria?!" November 22nd. Things progress fast. The Soviets pushed in 100 km at Stalingrad and took 18.000 prisoners. The Germans had 13.000 dead and wounded. The German troops in Stalingrad are surrounded. November 28th. The number of Jews killed in Poland grew from 700.000 to one million. German massacres must have reached frightening numbers, if we count all the horrors in occupied Soviet territory. And the murders continue. Our authorities seem to hesitate now about anti-Jewish measures. For now, it doesn't matter whether it's because of events or a return to genuine human conscience. January 10th. Snow. The Jews are off to work. Near Cotroceni, a few were beaten by soldiers for "being too slow". The capital is becoming a Jewish worksite. The snow is an unforgiving communal institution. Since Stephen the Great, the Church has been the foundation of our nation. In church, the Marshal has pledged to have faith and fight fearlessly for Romania. We've never struck at anyone. Romanians have never coveted other nations' land. We cannot be accused of conquest in the East. It is a holy war for national unity and for defending Europe. When we were forced to defend our land, preempting a new invasion from across the Dniester, it was not for destruction. We brought there the cross of re-Christianisation and supported the population. April 4th. A train with Jews from Thessaloniki has stopped here on the way to Poland. Their fate there is known. They've been allowed no contact here. Attempts to give them food or water were prevented. In the country once called Orthodox Russia, Christian crosses were removed to make room for Jewish tombstones, because Jews rule supreme there. This is the home of a Jewish political commissar, full of firearms, because he owned the lives of the Soviet proletarians. May 26th. Gas, the most fearsome weapon, hasn't been used so far. None of the many warring parties dared to. no matter how tragic and desperate the fight. This weapon seems to have been reserved for the Jewish sector. We keep hearing of Jews under German occupation being gassed. Despite official reports, people refuse to believe this is possible. Genuine scene in a tram: A Jew offers his seat to an old Christian. "I won't sit here after a dirty Jew!" he said fiercely. A Christian gentleman nearby asks: "You don't want the seat?" "No, I don't!" The other takes the Jew's seat. Two minutes later, he stands up and tells the old man: "You can sit down. I've Romanianised it." January 10th. Yesterday I hailed a taxi. The driver said: "Do you know what car this is?" "The Prime Minister was assassinated in it!" All lives depend on the war's outcome, writers included. Remy de Gourmont was bluffing when he said about the previous war, "It didn't bother me." And Montherlant's claims that art cannot stop because of war because the artist's only goal is personal - that's nonsense. Let's see them say it today, when France is ruined, not in 1938, when the French still believed in their strength. Air raid sirens! To the cannons! Anti-aircraft artillery stop the enemy bombers. But the enemy is undeterred. Anti-aircraft guns increase their fire! Yesterday we saw the horror of American bombing. Hundreds of bombers flew over Bucharest, raining bombs on us. It was a terrible time. Between bombs, I ran to my first-aid post. My family was scared to death in the shelter. A bomb hit a nearby house, crushing the grocer's family. Bombs also fell on Mărășești Boulevard. So many victims, incalculable damage. Many died in bombed shelters. No more water and electricity, trams barely running. My nephew found all his neighbours dead - 11 people. Dozens of people died suffocated in a shelter nearby. Hundreds more died in the Obor shelter. Some estimate about 2.000 victims. We wait, in fear, for more disasters. April 14th. Little Clara is 9; she's one of the hundreds of orphans sent from Transnistria to be shipped to Palestine. Her tiny body bears the stigmata of malnutrition: swollen abdomen, thin legs. When she was 6, her parents took her with them to Chernowitz. Then deportations to Transnistria started. They spent 3 years there. Friends of ours care for her lovingly, until she is sent for Palestine. She speaks of death with petrifying nonchalance. "Each morning I'd see dead boys and girls. I stepped on bodies." "I don't know how I survived." "I ate beetroot and potato peels." Now borscht or potato stew make her sick. What's scary is how she hates Christians, whom she fears viscerally. A friend was visiting my daughter. She saw him enter and ran to us, screaming: "There's a Christian in there! Make him leave!" "He's not a Christian, dear." "But he speaks Romanian!" She refuses to speak it. She learned Yiddish precisely to not use Romanian. June 24th. After similar letters, Patriarch Nicodim wrote to the Archbishop of London, pleading for the bombing to cease. His arguments are the same: Romanians are, of course, kind, generous and deeply loving. Surely, the Archbishop has seen how tolerant Romanians are: They've never oppressed those of other faiths or origins. The letter needs no further comment, particularly where the high prelate states that basic war decency asks that only militants be killed, not innocent women, children and elderly people. The Archbishop of Canterbury is fully aware of those realities, as is the Patriarch, in all their cruelty. He's witnessed all the injustice and abuse. So he knows what answer to expect. August 23rd. We heard King Michael's proclamation on the radio announcing our changing sides to the Allied camp, taking Transylvania back, the reinstatement of freedom and a new Government, including Communists and Socialists. The Communist leader read out the amnesty of all political prisoners, excepting Legionnaires. Romania's history has turned a colossal page. We all went out on the streets, cheering. The neighbours offered us champagne, then we went to see some friends. Passers-by shouted "Hooray for peace!" April 10th. If someone interviewed the Romanian people - the prejudice-ridden majority of leaders and the middle class - our current situation would look painful. Many say: "Why do Jews go to the People's Tribunal for political revenge?" "The wheel could turn someday." The answer is that they are criminally wrong. Our agreement with the Allies includes punishment for war criminals. The People's Tribunal was not formed by and of Jews. Many Jews stand witness because they were subject to Romanian cruelty in Transnistria. The others are unconvinced, fake smiles hiding wounded dignity. An actress friend told me: "I hate workers like dung worms!" Another bitter line in the interview with the Romanian people. May 9th. Germany has capitulated. War is over in Europe. A historical, military, and political reality awaited for over 5 years. Germany has capitulated. That is all. After all their crimes, pillage, disasters and savagery, crushed in their own country surrounded by Allied forces, the Germans have surrendered. It was bound to happen. We expected it 3, 2, one year ago. Yet no one tried to rebel. No one could stop the decline of a country crazed with megalomania, poisoned by hatred, open to imbecility and cruelty. Nothing to write, nothing to comment. June. The People's Tribunal continues its work. But there's less interest than for the first trial. It's like a holiday meeting. Newspapers give perfunctory, dull reports. Hardly anyone reads them. Still, more beasts are being tried, as bad as the first glorious lot. Many people are still missing or unidentified. Many criminals will remain in state jobs, in the military, everywhere. What became of General Georgescu, who in '42 was telling his barber: "I killed so many Jews, to my heart's content and beyond!" The Bucharest population has cheered our delegates' return from Moscow, after negotiations with excellent results for us. A crowd gathered at the airport to welcome them and express gratitude to our great neighbour, the Soviet Union. At landing, the enthusiastic crowd broke the cordons. People hailed Generalissimus Stalin, and our government, and the eternal Romanian-Soviet friendship. Prime Minister Dr. Petru Groza stated: "I hope that the wind carries our voice throughout the country," "so that you may know we come from the home of our great neighbour," "the Soviet Union!" People chant "Sta-lin! Sta-lin!" "Stu-dents sup-port the work-ing class!" "U-S-S-R!" February 28th. Titel Petrescu, the ridiculous politician, said: "We've never had religious intolerance." "There was anti-Semitism, but all because of the Jews trying to take over commerce," "entering conflict with the Romanians." So a Marxist can still utter such nonsense? His theory will certainly spread and be exploited. Soon, we will surely hear the Jews have taken over democracy, which will justify the new anti-Semitism. Sadly, there's no way to react, nowhere to write to. "Sticking together" means being silent and swallowing it all together. June 2nd. The two Antonescus, Piki Vasiliu, and Alexianu have been executed. The other three who were also sentenced to death had it shifted to hard labour for life. I think this ends the major sentences for war criminals. "It's too late, Romanians are too kind" etc. A few more will be sentenced, amid general indifference. Then the elections will come. And we will continue rebuilding the country and re-educating people...
