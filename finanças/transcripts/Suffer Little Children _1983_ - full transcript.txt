- [Narrator] This picture is a reconstruction of events which took place at 45 Kingston Road, New Malden, in August 1984. These events were never reported in the press. The house is now derelict and scheduled for demolition. (eerie music) (wistful guitar music) - Whoops, steady on, you two! You lot keep playing and I'll send you to bed early. - Oh, Jen, you wouldn't. - Course she wouldn't, don't be thick! - Don't call me thick! - Is there a good film on tonight, Jenny? - There is, but it's on too late for you. - Cath, see if you can rustle up something quick and hot, can you? I think our new little visitor could use something hot inside her. There's a good girl. - Oh, poor little thing! Look at her. She looks so miserable. - How about some nice hot drinking chocolate? There's some nearly ready. - Jenny, I think I'd better go and make some phone calls. You get her settled in as I suspect she'll be staying with us for a few days till we can sort this out. Oh and we've got to notify the police, they'll try and find the parents. - Okay. - Don't worry, Elizabeth, we'll take good care of you, I promise. (children chattering) - Come on kids, don't block the door, okay? You're making Elizabeth feel embarrassed, come on. Clear off. Back to the day room. You'll all get a chance to meet Elizabeth later on. - There's a good girl, there you go. And look, Cath's made you this nice hot chocolate. Would you like some? I'll take your bag, shall I? Let's drink it before it gets cold. - Oh, poor little thing! - Yeah. Yes, we can take care of her just now. Yeah. No, I haven't had a chance to do that yet. She only turned up literally minutes ago, but I will notify the police with the next phone call. (clears throat) Yeah, listen, while I do that can you get on to, um, Doctor Stokely for me? It'll save me a bit of time. I really want to get back to that kid. I mean, God knows what's going on inside her head, just being dumped like that. And her not being able to speak can't make it any better. You will? Great. Listen, um, I want to get on to the police right away, whoever abandoned her might still be in the area. Well, you know, probably having second thoughts. Okay, great. Bye. (sighs) - Elizabeth, now, can you speak at all? No? Can you read or write yet? No? Well, don't worry. Look, all I want you to do is if you need anything, I want you to get hold of me or Morris and show us whatever it is you want, okay? There's a good girl. - Well, Elizabeth, would you like us to try and find your Mummy and Daddy for you? Well, um, would you mind if we had a look inside your carrier bag? In case there's anything there that could help us? - Thank you, Elizabeth. Now, what have we got? A coat. A sweater. Oh, there's two sweaters. Pair of socks. And oh, look, is this your dolly? No? Oh, well. Morris, there's nothing. No labels, no name tags, nothing at all. - Hmm, that's a shame. So, these things are never easy. Elizabeth, would you like to meet some of the other kids who live here? And while you're doing that, we'll find you a nice room for you to put your things in. And then you can have Sunday lunch with us. You arrived just in time for a lovely meal. That was lucky, wasn't it? - Okay? Would you like to come in with me and meet all the children now? There's a good girl. (children chattering) So we get to the point. This is Natalie. - Hello, Elizabeth. - This is Henry, he's about the same age as you are. Say hello to Elizabeth, Henry. - Hello, Elizabeth, very pleased to meet you. - This is Sarah. - Hello, Elizabeth. Why can't you speak? Is there something wrong with you? - No, Sarah. If she can't speak that doesn't mean there's something wrong with her. That wasn't very nice. - I had to ask though. - All right, kids, get on with whatever you were doing. Come along, Elizabeth. (door slams) (Sarah screams) - Sarah, what happened? - Oh, don't be such a misery, Morris, it's not that bad. - Oh, it's all right for you, you don't have to know what to say to visitors. Just because he was brought up here years ago, well now I'm bent over backward. What's the point of his coming back now anyway? Probably just for publicity, sell more records. - One thing Mick Phillips doesn't need is help to sell his records. The last three have all reached number one and this tour he's doing is now totally sold out. - That's all the more reason for him to get on with it, then, isn't it? Instead of coming back here and bothering us. - You know, Morris, sometimes I think you grumble just for the sake of it. The kids are looking forward to it. This charity show he's doing is all coming to the home. Do try to be a bit less stuffy, Morris. - That's another thing, Jen, if he's so rich and famous, why doesn't he just give us the money? All this publicity, it's embarrassing. - Stop. - Sorry, I can't help it. I've never met a pop star before. What if he starts offering out drugs? - Morris, if he does that just smile sweetly and say, "No thanks, I'm trying to give them up." Listen, Morris... We should all be thankful for this show he's doing. Not just for the money, but the publicity from it will show people that kids from homes don't always end up on the scrap heap. Besides, it seems to me that doing it this way is a really nice gesture. Sort of like a big thank you to the way people bought him up when he was here. - Well, I wonder. - Admit it, Morris, you're shy. You've never met a real live pop star before and you're just as excited as me, really. - Mmm, yeah, I'm going to go jumping all over him to sign pictures and autograph. - Look, here he comes now! (children exclaim) - All right, kids. (children shouting) - Hello. You're Jen? This is Hustler. - All right, all go to the day room! We'll be out in a minute, just settle down. Morris, this is Mick. - Nice to meet you. Meet Hustler. - Uh, well, come in here. - Thanks. - Okay, we'll be out in a minute, so go back in. Go on. - Have a sit down. - Cheers, thanks. - Anybody for coffee? - Yeah, great, thanks. - [Hustler] Uh, white, please. - Thank you. - Thanks, cheers. - Really, this charity show you're doing will be a great help to the home, I tell you. The kids are constantly on us asking for luxury items like video recorders and a hi-fi. - Right. - You know kids. - Yeah. - You going, Morris? - Oh, well, we'll see. - No, Morris won't be coming, actually. I'll be taking some of the kids, though. - Oh great. - In fact, one of the kids saw you on some pop program the other day. - That's right, we're doing a promotion for our single that's coming out shortly, so, uh, we've done a lot of TV work. It's been fun. - Oh, that's interesting. - Yeah, we've just done a tour of Japan recently and then we're off to America again in the new year. That's all been very chaotic. - Seems pretty hectic. - Hmm, not fucking much. (Morris clears throat) - Well, how long is it, uh, since you were last here? - In this room? - Yes. - God, got me thinking. Must be about eight years, I should imagine. It was usually because I was being told off for something or other. - Why, were you a hooligan? - Hooligan? He don't fucking change. - Yes, well, perhaps you'd like to um, have a look round the place, meet some of the kids? Yes? - Yes, that sounds like a good idea. - And I'll make you a coffee when you come back. - Right. - Okay. - After you. - Thanks. - [Mick] Cheers. - Okay, Mick, what do you fancy doing? Do you fancy going to see the kids, more of the kids, or looking upstairs? - I think we should meet the staff first, perhaps, yes? - All right. - Okay, it's just down here. I'll lead you the way. (girls giggling) - Hey, day room, please. - Mine? It will be a very eventful day. - Oh, we know that much, didn't we? Go on. Let me read yours. Aries? - [Cath] Yeah. You could be at odds with the world, which is hardly surprising, as irritations, delays, and frustrations pile up. - You're going to mess up the kitchen again, thanks for warning me. Great! - Keep cool, keep calm. - Well, don't I always? I mean, it's my middle name, isn't it? - No comment. - It's rubbish, you know, just rubbish. - I know, I know. I don't really believe in this. Not in papers, just runes- (footsteps approaching) Oh! - Chaps. - A pair of nice women. - Excuse him, that's Hustler. He's supposed to be my roadie, keep me out of trouble. Usually works out the other way round. - Well, pleased to meet you Hustler. I think. - Hello. - He looks like a big teddy bear, doesn't he? - Teddy bear, eh? (giggling) - There goes your image, Hustler. - Teddy bear! Fantastic, innit? - Never mind, Hustler, your secret's safe with us. - I hope so. - Still, it certainly has changed. Freezer? And two toasters. I never thought about it before, it must be a lot of work cooking for all these kids and people who work here. Lord knows what it was like when I was here, just cooking with gas. - Mmm, yeah it has changed a bit. But, um, the art is still in getting the quantities right with so many to feed. - It's all right for you, though. You're the boss. I mean you don't have to worry about the little things like washing the dishes and things like that. And it doesn't help when a certain person not a million miles away from here keeps on dirtying all the cups with his constant requests for coffee. - That's right, up the workers. - You're under fire, Morris. - I'll remind you you said that when your road crew come after you for more money or shorter hours. - Come on, never mind Hustler's problems. Come on, let's go and look around the place. - All right. - The kids rooms have changed since you were last here, too, Mick. - Mm-hmm. - [Jen] I'll let you into this room first. - [Hustler] Do you want to go first? (knocks at door) - God, he's good looking. - He's got really nice blonde hair. - Yeah, do you like his jacket? - Yeah, I think it's really nice. His music is great as well. - Oh, do you listen to it? I don't really listen to it. - Yeah, why don't you like it? - Well it's... Yeah, it's all right, but... (girls screaming) - Whose place is this? - It's mine. - Is it? - Yeah, it's mine. - You're all sleeping in here? - Yeah. It's all right. - So what do you know about John? - It's a pop group. (girls laughing) - That's right. - How come some of you lot have got shy all of a sudden? You're not usually like that. (girls laughing) - We've never seen a pop star before, Jen. - I see. - You've seen a real life pop star now. Here you are then. - Hi. - Hello. - Are you a vegetarian by any chance? - No, are you a vegetarian? - No. Did you sleep here? - When you was here, did you like it? - Did I like it? I loved it. Yeah, I was here a long time ago. - How long were you here for? - About eight years ago, I think it is now. Uh guess I was only about two, so 14 years I was here. - I'm sixteen now. (giggling) (girls whispering) - Excuse me, you two. Come along. This is Elizabeth. Unfortunately, she can't speak. - You've got nice hair, haven't you? How long did this take to grow? That's nice, isn't it? Can you smile, then? No? Oh, you like my cross. (eerie music) - [Demonic Voice] This in remembrance of me. (scary music) Take it in remembrance of me. And on the third day... (electronic music) (phone rings) (children chattering) - I haven't done any homework and I'm gonna get killed. - Nan, it's not that bad. - And I feel tired, I'd like to try for a day off. - God, Elaine, if there's one part of the day this house really hurts, it's breakfast. - All in the mind, Jenny. All in the mind. - Do you think that the neatest party will recognize a couple of abandoned thirty odd screaming monsters before they're off to school. - Benny, give Basil a hand, his leg's caught in the chair leg. I have fun teaching that baby bird, too, Basil? - Yeah, he's so sweet. He never ever complains about anything. - I know what you mean, he's always so happy. Come on, you lot. Come on, the bus'll be here soon. Come on! Come on, now. - Basil, come to the kitchen. I've got some fine chocolate surprise, but don't tell any of the others, all right? - Wow, thanks Elaine. - Jenny? - What's the matter, Daisy? - Jenny, I think I must've ate something bad. I really don't feel well. - Come on, you two, up and get ready and right now. - Oh, but my stomach really hurts. I think I'm gonna be sick. - You do and you can clear it up. You've got known type of homework-itis, that's all. Now, go and get ready right now and if you haven't done your homework, you tell Miss Crease that you forgot to bring it. She might buy the old stories. Come on. Yes, Morris, just coming. - There. - Hello? Oh, hello, Dr. Stokely. Yes. Clear? So, what does that mean? Not physical. So the fact that she can't speak or won't speak is down to something in her mind or her past? Oh, poor thing. So you don't think that treatment might... (frightening music) Thanks anyway. Bye. She said there's nothing physically wrong with her. - So under the circumstance, it's psychiatric? - [Jen] Who knows what she needs. - Well, listen, if it is something mental are you sure this is the best place for her? - No, there's nowhere else for her. - It's funny, this is the right place for her. It is why we're here. - Could she benefit from this environment. But it's unlikely that we'll find out. Unless the police can find her family. (loud music) (crash) - Right, kids, first things first. Basil's in Intensive Care. We don't know what condition he's in or if he's gonna get better. So we want to find out just what happened, right? Now, who wants to go first? - He just fell. - That's right he was just clumping up the stairs and he keeled out backwards and just fell. Honest, Morris, really. - Wait a minute. One minute he's all right going up the stairs, the next thing he just falls down again, is that what you're trying to tell me? - Yeah, that's dead right, Morris. - It's the truth, Morris, promise. - Look, kids, I have to admit that I'm a bit surprised. - Why's that, Jenny? - Okay, I'll tell you why I'm surprised. First I see Basil at the bottom of the stairs, then I see Elizabeth at the top, and suddenly I see you two appear. Fair enough, accidents do happen. But the way you, both of you, try to pass it off so glibly, well quite frankly, it makes me a bit suspicious. - Yeah, I know just what she means, kids. There's something about your attitude that certainly makes me think you're rehearsed with your answers. - That's not fair. We haven't done anything. We haven't been in trouble before. - Yeah, you can't blame us for what happened to Basil. - Until you mentioned it there was no question of blaming anyone. The way you two are talking, it sounds as if you've got something to hide. - What is this? First you try to find out what happened to Basil and when we tell you, you try to stick the blame on us! - Yeah, you'd better be careful with your accusations, Morris! - Listen, miss, you just remember where you are! - I won't have any lip from either of you, so get that into your heads right from the start. And if you decide to stick together with your answers, then we'll just have to find a way to separate you all. Maybe that way we can avoid accusations and tempers. - Oh, I know, we'll have a written statement. - Good idea, Morris. - Come on, spread out. So you can't look at each other. Now, let's see what you come up with when you're not listening to one another. And I don't want to hear a single word from either one of you, all right? That's it, get on with it. Don't leave anything out. Jen, this could take a bit of time. Do you fancy getting us both a coffee? - Right, coming up, Morris, won't be a minute. (door shuts) - Oh, hi, Jenny. How's Basil? - No news, I'm afraid. He's likely to have been in Intensive Care for some time. - I don't care what anyone says, Basil wouldn't just fall. I mean, I've seen him run up and down those stairs. He just wouldn't fall! Bloody certain something funny's happened, you know? - I'm afraid I'm inclined to agree with you, Elaine. That was quick. - Yeah, I want you to read them. - They didn't copy it? - Nope. I stood over them to make sure. They've come out exactly the same. - Well, I'm sure there's something fishy going on. - Hmm, the question is why? You know these kids as well as I do, Jen. They're not bullies or hooligans, either of them. - Then let's get to the bottom of this right now. Hello, kids. Interesting reading these. Especially interesting the way they both say the very same thing. It sort of makes me think they might have even been rehearsed for some reason. And I wonder what that reason might be. - Yeah, well I intend to find out, so we'll have no more fairy tales, understood? Right. Jules, what were you doing at the top of the stairs? And you can keep quiet. - We weren't doing anything. - All right, we'll do this the slow way. Why were you there? - I was talking to Carol, that's all. - Just talking, eh? And what were you talking about, Carol? - Don't remember. - Hmm, convenient. Jules? - I don't remember either. - Look here, Carol, what were you doing at the top of the stairs? - Just talking. - Really, all right, I'm getting sick of this. You're just going round in circles and I'm not gonna fall for it. Jules, what were you doing with Elizabeth? Ah, I got a reaction. Maybe we're getting somewhere at last. Come on, Jules, out with it. - We weren't doing any-- - I didn't ask you! Quiet! Come on, Jules, answer me. - We weren't doing anything, honest. - Nothing, eh? Carol, you're usually honest. What have you got to say for yourself? - Morris, I wasn't doing anything to Elizabeth. - Yes, then why-- - Honest. - All right! I've had enough of this. You really don't seem to understand how serious this is. Basil could die from his injuries-- - Morris! - No, it's the truth, Jenny, and then should know it. If they were up to something and Basil got mixed up in it, they have to realize how bad it can be for them. Now, listen. I don't know what happened at the top of the stairs this morning. It may take the police to sort it out. But if I find that you were bullying that kid because you knew she couldn't talk about it afterwards, I'll have you both shipped out of here so quick you won't know what's hit you. Understood? Now. You've taken the time to rehearse your stories so well that they've come out identically. Now what you're gonna do now is go away and unlearn them and tomorrow we'll go through all this again. And I better get some truthful answers, otherwise I'll just put the whole matter into the hands of the police. Got it? I said, got it? - [Girls] Yes, Morris. - Good, right, get out of here. See you again tomorrow. - Do you really think they're up to something with Elizabeth? - I think that once she stepped into view, she was hanging onto that crucifix Mick Phillips gave her. I think they were trying to steal the crucifix from her and Basil got in the way and all. - Hmm, never thought of that. Mind you, she can't speak, she can't tell on them. The perfect victim. - And that could also account for her silence with us, the way she refused to communicate. Pure fear. After all, they're still perfect strangers to her. - I don't give a damn. - Elaine, there are times when I haven't a clue what goes on in your head. Look at her for God's sake! She's so tiny and so pretty. I just can't see what you don't like about her. - Look, Cath, no one expects me to be sensible. I just don't like her. All right, she's lovely and I know it's sad that she can't speak and all that, but I still don't like her. - All right, then. Out with it. - Nah, you'll think I'm daft. - No need to think that! I've known that since your first day when I asked you to separate some eggs, you put one on the table, one in the fridge, and one in the cupboard. - Oh, very funny. - Come on, then, out with it. - (sighs) It's her eyes. - Her what? - I said it's her eyes. Well, if you must know, it's the way she looks at me. - You're right! - I'm right? God, you've never said that before. What am I right about? - You're right, I do think you're daft. Now, will you get on with that icing? I want that cake ready in plenty of time for the party. - [Man] Morris, somebody just delivered something! - [Morris] Oh. - [Man] What's that? - [Morris] Jenny, I think this, uh, must be for you. (envelope opening) - [Mick's Voice] "Dear Jenny, if you've still got Tuesday evening off, why don't I pick you up about 7:30 and we'll both have a night off? I'll phone to confirm it. Best wishes, Mick Phillips." - [Jen] Hmm, a bit sure of himself, isn't he? - [Morris] Yes, very. - [Mick] All right, what do you normally like to do on a night off? Got any regular haunts? - [Jen] To be honest, no. I have quite a quiet life. - [Mick] What, have you no love life? - [Jen] No. I haven't got round to anything like that. I'm usually too busy. - [Mick] Okay, then tonight let's try to live it up a bit. What do you fancy, somewhere lively or somewhere quiet? The night's yours. - [Jen] I honestly don't know, I haven't thought about it. - [Mick] Okay, let's do both. We'll go somewhere and boogie for a while and work up an appetite and then later on we'll go somewhere for a late supper. Tell you what, there's a place I know called Cloudbusters. It's not too noisy and the crowd there are a lively lot. A bit weird, but that's okay. How about that? - [Jen] Oh, that sounds all right by me. (disco music) (reggae music) - Boys and girls, Cloudbusters is very pleased and very proud to present one of the biggest stars around today. Harry, swing the light around will you? There you are, Mr. Mick Phillips. (crowd cheers) (hard rock music) - It has been an eventful day. I wonder how poor Basil is. - Basil, isn't he the kid with the cane? - Yes, he's a bit slow, mentally. But he's a beautiful boy. Poor kid. - So, what happened to him? - He fell down the stairs today. He's in Intensive Care, don't know if he'll ever recover. At least he's supposed to have fallen, but maybe not. - What makes you say that? - Well, there were some kids at the top of the stairs when he fell. Remember that girl you gave your crucifix to, Elizabeth? - Yeah. - Well, she was there, too. Morris thinks that the other kids were trying to get the crucifix off of her and that Basil got mixed up in it, so he was knocked down the stairs. - So, you reckon he blames me for giving the crucifix to Elizabeth? - Oh no, not really. He's got me saying "really" all the time, now. But it's a long time since we've had an incident like this, you know? It's usually very quiet. - Jen. Is Morris your... - My what? Oh, no, nothing like that. What made you say that? - Well, he sure. God, he's got me in it now. But he sort of got all protective of you. As though you were somebody special to him. - I don't know! Six kids nearly drowned! - I know. I know, Jen, just settle down now. I just want... Relax, I just want to know exactly-- - I can't relax! How can I relax when six kids nearly drowned? - We have to try, we have to try. We have to try, look, there's no use crying over spilled milk. No harm was done in the end, was it? None of the kids have drowned. They're all okay-- - If it hadn't been for the lifeguard they would have drowned, Morris! - I understand that. Did the lifeguard say what happened? - Yes, but it all happened too quickly. - When... Look, we have to try and rationalize this and just make things logical and then-- - Look, I can't explain it, can you? - No, I can't explain. Look, just try and visualize it now. Where were you? There's the shallow end and the deep end. Where were you? - I was in the deep end, Morris. - Where were the six kids who nearly drowned? - In the deep end, too. - So you were quite close to them. - Yeah, I was quite close. - Right. Were Carol and Jules involved? - Yes, they were. They were messing around with me. And then it all happened, I don't know what happened, but it... Oh, God. - Jen. - Can you explain it? - Pure panic. That's all it was, Jen. - Morris, if it was some sort of group hysteria, then what brought it on? That sort of thing doesn't just happen! Besides, there's more to it than the kids nearly drowning. Or have you forgotten the other two? They deliberately stopped me from reaching the other kids! - Jen, why don't we just-- - No, let me finish, Morris. I'm prepared to accept that grabbing my bikini top was just horseplay, but they deliberately prevented me from reaching the other kids. They could have drowned, Morris. (sighs) Well? - I can see you're worked up about it all, but are you really trying to convince me that both at the same time, Jules and Carol realized that the other kids were about to start to drown all at the same time and that without speaking they then, what, conspired together, without speaking, in order to keep you occupied? - Oh, don't be so smug, Morris. I know what happened, I was right in the middle of it. - Don't jump down my throat. All right, you come up with an explanation that makes any sense. I'll be glad to hear it, really. - No. I don't have an answer. All I do know is that six kids didn't all take it into their heads to try and drown at the exact same moment. Especially when two of the kids are normally good swimmers. - Calm down, Jen. (strikes match) (phone rings) - 942405. Oh, hello. Yes, hold on a second, I'll just get her for you. Jen, it's for you, Mick Phillips. - Jenny speaking. - Hello, Jenny, you sound a bit gormy. - Oh, do I? Yeah, I'm sorry. I've just been having a discussion with Morris. Anyway, how are you, Mick? - So-so. Has he been giving you a hard time? - A bit. - I can imagine. Probably had no sleep last night, I expect he'd be bad company. - How did you guess? - Don't tell me, he just a grownup. - Exactly. - What do you say (indistinct) - No, you'd better not. Listen, what can I do for you? Or are you just in a chatty mood? I'm a busy person, remember. - I'm sorry, it's all this easy living. I'm not used to mixing with the working classes. No, listen, it's about that birthday party, is it still on for this afternoon or was it this evening? - Oh, yes, I'm glad you reminded me of that. It's this evening. Hang on a moment. Morris, you don't mind if Mick comes to the party tonight, do you? I said it would be all right. - Jen, of course I don't mind. Your friends are always welcome here, you know that. - Mick, we'd love to have you. About seven-ish? - All right. (indistinct) - How'd you know that? - Oh, he's not so bad. He's a bit old fashioned, but it's all to save your back. - Glad you said that, actually, it's true. So what have you been doing with yourself today? - Ah, it's a surprise. You'll find out tonight around seven. See you then. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - All right? - Yeah. He said he's coming round about seven-ish. He said he's bringing some sort of surprise, but he wouldn't actually say what it was. - I wonder what that might be. - Now, Morris-- - Don't worry, Jen. I'll behave myself. Really, I'll make a special effort, promise. - Well, see that you do, otherwise I'll be very angry with you.

I expected to get a feeling of coming home. Well, I didn't get it. - What, no feelings at all? - The only feeling I got when I came inside this building is the way that those other kids feel now. Whatever roots I have are in me, wherever I am. - Well, that's good. That's good. I mean, no man should have a building as his past. Home's the people that you knew then, your teachers and friends and whoever knew you first in life, see. And that's what we have to try and do for the kids here now. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. Or maybe it doesn't work for some. - Morris, if it hadn't been for the people like you, God knows what I'd be doing today. If I was rude or one thing yesterday, I'm sorry. It was wrong. - I know what you mean. I don't make things easy even for myself. I try to be witty and it just comes out sarcastic. And I'm just not very good with grownups, I suppose. - Oh, you're not too bad. - Hmm. Mick... (clears throat) About you and Jenny? Are you... Are you interested in her? - Why, are you? - What the hell's that? (children screaming) - Stop it! Stop it, get her out, quick! (girl screaming) - What the hell is going on? (girls laughing) (wistful guitar music) - The kids are all in bed. Morris has taken care of it. - I really ought to have helped him. - He told me you'd say that. Well, they went to bed without any fuss straightaway. - You must be exhausted after today. I know I am. I tell you, I'm looking forward to going to bed tonight. - It's quiet out here. - Yeah. When the weather's good, I often come out here just to rest my ears a bit. - I could do with a place like this myself. Especially after work. - I thought that you'd have a lovely house, Mick. - I suppose. If expensive equals nice. - You don't sound very happy about it. - Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy. I've been very lucky. I've got all the things I'm expected to have. But when all is said and done, I guess I don't feel any different to when I was a kid in this place. An orphan. - What do you mean, Mick? Are you lonely? - Probably. - I'm sorry about that, I really am. - Still in a couple of years I'll be able to retire and perhaps try and have a personal life of my own. - What sort of person are you looking for? - I don't know. Possibly someone like you. Jesus, what a day. - God, you can say that again. I haven't had a week like it. - I just don't know what the devil's got into them. I'm really staggered by it all. - Everything's been going wrong. This whole week's been crazy. - Hmm. From what I've seen, I hope it's not typical. - No. No, mate, I can assure you that. Quite the opposite. In fact... In fact, this week's been so unusual that at one point, um... Well, I have to admit, I thought it was somehow your fault. - My fault? How'd you work that out? - My own weakness. We have an excellent record, here. We never have any violence or trouble. I suppose I just wanted somebody to blame for the way things have gone wrong this week. I mean, you were a new influence and it was just easier to look for someone to blame than to find the real cause of it. I'm sorry. But if it makes up for my bad behavior, Jenny stuck up for you all along. - It wasn't anything like that, Mick. Morris didn't just come out and say, "Basil's fallen down the stairs, must be Mick's fault." He's trying to find any new influence that might have triggered this all off. - So apart from the wicked rock star, what else could be the cause? Any answers? - No. Not really. - I'm not so sure. - I think what you're gonna say, Jen. - You do? - Mm. - Well I wish you'd say it, 'cos I'd like to know what in hell is going on here. - Mick, in the past few days lots of unusual things have been happening here. - Since I came on the scene, you mean. - Well, at first it did look that way. But I've been thinking about it and I think that there's something that we have to include. - [Morris] Elizabeth. - [Jen] Afraid so. - [Mick] Elizabeth? That little kid? - [Jen] Look, I know how stupid this will sound to you both, but I'm sure she's involved. - [Mick] But she's one of the youngest kids in the place. - [Jen] I know that. Look, this isn't going to be sensible, any of this. - [Morris] Look, Jen, just say it. Don't worry about how it sounds. - [Jen] All right. Look, we went for months and the most trouble we've ever had was kids occasionally fighting over trivial things. The first unusual thing wasn't Mick's visit, it was Elizabeth being abandoned here. - [Morris] The day before? - [Jen] Yeah. - [Mick] God, was she dumped here that recently? - Yes. The same day, Sarah became our first accident. Then she was there when Basil had his accident. She was at the top of the stairs with Carol and Jules. Then she's at the swimming pool when the kids nearly drowned. Those two deliberately stopped me from helping them. Then she was at the party when the fight broke out. - Yeah, but she didn't start the fight and how could she drown six kids all at the same time? - Well, I didn't say I could explain it. But, just feelings I have, that's all. - I guess I must be as crazy as you, Jenny, 'cos I... Well, I tend to agree with you. - You do? - Yes, I do. I don't know how she's doing these things or even whether she does them herself. I think she might be using those other two like her... Soldiers or something? At first I thought they were bullying her, but now they seem so close and with two more kids on her side, it becomes more difficult to keep an eye on them. I mean, even if she wasn't seen when these things have happened, I mean, I can't honestly say that I've had my eye on Carol and Jules, they could've been up to anything! - I'm sorry, both of you, but it all seems very unlikely to me. Even if she was getting those two kids to do her dirty work for her, how can she explain what she wants them to do? She can't talk, remember? - [Jen] I know all that. I didn't say that I was making any sense. But there's absolutely no way that I can back all my feelings up in any way. - Nonetheless, Jenny, I think you could be right. I certainly intend to keep a very close eye on Elizabeth and her two pals from now on. - Well, Morris, do you think it'll be a quiet day? - Yes, I do, really. You know, I thought about it for ages last night, but it just all seems different today. When I look at it I think it was just an unfortunate set of circumstances all crammed into one rotten day. Look at it any other way and it becomes pure paranoia and just gets worse the more you think about it. - Oh, I don't know. I woke up this morning almost frightened. As if I was under siege, waiting for the next attack. - There we are. The more we let ourselves get worked up about it, the worse it'll seem. Let's just treat today like any other day and see what turns up, yeah? - Oh, I hope you're right. All the same, I'm going to keep a close eye on Elizabeth. - Hmm. - Look, she's staring over here. - Good, let her look. - I'm bloody fed up, my party was ruined, and I want to use the new stereo with the volume full up. - No, Morris will complain it's too loud, really! (girls laugh) - Judy's party was terrible, wasn't it? - I know, but it's my birthday on Friday and I'll brain anyone who screws that up! - Oh, you always want to hit people, Jackie. - Shut up, then or else I'll hit you, Maxine! Why are you such in a mood today? - I'm not! - Oh, yeah. Is there any more milk? Oh, great. I can't eat any more of this. Why have you got your jacket on? - I'm freezing! - Yeah, I suppose it is a bit cold. Oh, have you seen that new girl, Elizabeth? - Oh, God, have you seen her eyes? - Yeah, they're all dark and evil! - We were making fun of her the other day. Have you seen the book she's reading? - No, what is it about? - It's weird. - It's not kid stuff? - I'd look over her head. - She's strange, though, isn't she? - Hello, Benny. Thinking about Basil? - Yes. - Don't worry, son, he'll be all right. - Yeah, I know. - Look, he's still in Intensive Care, but the doctor said he would be okay, so just don't worry, okay? - Jen, it just isn't fair. Look, he'd never hurt anyone. - I know. I know you're his friend, just don't worry. We don't know what happened to him. We know he fell down the stairs, but we just don't know what happened. - Basil wouldn't fall! I should be with him. - You know, it's been a really funny week. I was thinking about it last night. Remember, Judy, I was talking for ages. Well, anyway, I was thinking. First Sarah got clocked on the head, then Basil ended up in hospital, then, Judy, you nearly got drowned and your party was ruined and everything. I mean, it's really been a wild few days. - I know, my head still hurts when I lie on that side of where I conked my head. - But what I wanna know is what's causing it. (rock music) (crash) - What are you doing? Terri! Calm down, just calm down now. Jenny! Jenny. No, just calm down. Just calm down. All right. Don't worry, stay there, just... Hand me the knife very gently. (Terri screams) Give me the knife. (Terri screams) (Morris yelps) (Terri screams) (eerie music) - [Demonic Voice] Suffer the children. (phone ringing) - Oh, hello, Mick. God, what a day we're having. Well, Morris has been stabbed and according to Dr. Stokely, one of our kids is in a coma. (Jen screams) (crash) - Come here! - [Jen] No! Oh! - What is... (laughing) - Come on! Please! Oh! (girls laughing) (Jen screaming) - Jesus Christ! (Jen screams) - No! Please help! No! (Jen screams) (Jen panting) (dishes clattering) (Jen screaming) - [Demonic Voice] Stand! Slaves! You will do what I want you to do! - God, this is the first chance I've had to rest all day! - What are you doing, Elizabeth? - What are you doing with the knives? - [Demonic Voice] Stay in your chair, boy! You, follow my commands. - Hey. What are you doing? (Elaine sobs) Elaine? What are you doing? Elaine! - No, no! - Don't! - [Demonic Voice] Do it! - No! Oh! - [Demonic Voice] Do it! Do it! Do it! - No, stop! Stop! (Elaine screaming) - No, stop! (Elaine screaming) - [Demonic Voice] Die, bitch! (girls laughing) (rock music) Come to me, my little babies. (clicking phone) - Good God! It's dead. (hard rock music) - [Jen] Mick! - [Mick] What the hell's been going on here? - [Morris] I don't know, the... The kids have gone crazy. Jenny, go and get Dr. Stokely. - [Mick] Right, you stay here, we'll check upstairs. - [Demonic Voice] Protect me, my children. (girl screaming) - Oh! (children screaming) - Ahh! - Get off! Get off of me! Get off! - [Demonic Voice] Destroy them all! Destroy the Christ worshipers! (children screaming) (Hustler screaming) - [Demonic Voice] Ah! The power is coming! (Elizabeth screaming) (eerie music) - [Demonic Voice] Go. Crucify him. (Mick screaming) (Carol and Jules laughing) - [Demonic Voice] This in remembrance of me. - [All] Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! (louder) Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come, Devil, come! Come! - [Demonic Voice] I am here. (Demon snarls) (rock music) And now the game begins! No! Christ! (demonic howling) (Carol screaming) (Jules screaming) - No! (demonic howling) (Elizabeth screaming) (somber music) (keys in door) (Jen screaming) - No! No!
