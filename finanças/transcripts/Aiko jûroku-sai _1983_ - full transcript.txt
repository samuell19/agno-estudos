Where's Miko? Miko is in heaven now. Is she dead? On Christmas night, when I was 6 years old, my dear cat Miko died. Ever since then, I've been climbing on the roof of my house. It's so hot...

Directed by: Akiyoshi Imazeki Rise! This is class 1-А of our Hoshigaoka High School. Introducing the main characters. The long-awaited summer vacation starts tomorrow. It's a long vacation, so make up a plan for the summer. And try not to fall behind. Those are bad manners! - Understood? - Yes! - One more time. - Yes! I'm going to give your grade sheets. - Shihono Hiratsuka. - Yes? Gonbe, a friend. She's like an elder sister to me. She's in the swimming club. - Reiko Suzuki. - Yes, yes! - Once is enough. - Yes! Rinrin is a person of action. Brave dear Rinrin. - Motoko Kimura. - Yup! - Say "yes", not "yup". - Yes! Mokku. She's a glutton who spent all her youth eating. - Kyoko Okamoto. - Yes? O-Kyon. A pure and earnest curly maiden. She has a sweet tooth for cake. Beniko Hanaoka. Yes? Beniko. She's the one I'll never lose to. Aiko Mita. Miss Mita? Yes? Nice to meet you. I'm Aiko Mita. I'm an archery fan. I'm at the height of my youth - I'm 16! My grades aren't that great, but tomorrow my first holidays in high school begin. No bad grades can spoil my mood! Hit! Sanchū! A set of 4 kyūdō arrows. When you hit the mark once, it's hicchū. Twice, it's nichū. If all four - kaichū. Write: "All arrows hit the target". The referee stands by the targets. The archers shoot from the shooting line. Of course, freshers aren't allowed to shoot or even touch the bow. We practice taking the position and shooting using a rubber bow. Hit. Kaichū. You've done it again, Kawano! Unbelievable! Come on, let's do our best and repeat after our senior. But Kawano sure is the best. "But Kawano sure is the best!" Toshiba could use her as a prototype for a brown-nosing robot. She's a lecherous girl that messes with the boys' heads. What are you talking about? "But Kawano sure is the best!" - Is that Beniko? - Yeah. First of all, I don't like her name. - Yeah, Beniko sounds awful. - It sounds fine, but that's the sad part. - Fine? Are you serious? - That's not important. At least, it's not written in katakana like mine. Right, katakana has a techno feel to it. There's a trend to write in hiragana nowadays. Everyone writes in hiragana. They're so perverted! O-Kyon... RYOTA KAWANO - Mita, how's it going? - Yes? Are you waiting for someone? No, not really... Nice shooting. Ouch, be careful! What are you doing? - Sorry. - Watch it. - We saw everything. - Thank you for the treat! There must be some deep meaning to a locker. Putting a letter in the locker is so old-fashioned, though. But I told you it's not mine. It's okay, you can tell the truth. - Hey! - Hi, Mokku. As for you, Beniko part two, your intentions are quite obvious. Making excuses is pointless. - You're calling me Beniko part two? - I totally agree with Mokku. But, I've already told you, it's pure coincidence. Our senior was just... Typical excuses, right, Mokku? - For sure, Miss Beniko. - I'm about to get really angry! It's here! Go home, you lecherous girl! We'll talk later. Bye bye! You idiots! Silly girls! It's him. I've been meaning to ask you, why do you keep climbing on the roof? The earth is calling me. I hope you fall off one day. Maybe that will teach you. Then, until that time comes let's wait, Mum. Suit yourself. When will you stop this nonsense? No, even if I become a grandmother over 60, I won't stop. I'm afraid you'll fall off there and die before you become that old. Falling off the roof and dying is my dream. ♪ Crow, why are you crying? ♪ Let it cry ♪ Aiko. - What? - Have you washed your kyūdō uniform? - How are you going to go to the camp? - Oh, I forgot! That hurt! In summer, when the Kōshien baseball tournament is about to begin, our kyūdō team is going to a training camp. There we, freshers, are allowed to shoot the bow for the first time. - Teacher! - Oh, here you are! - Come on. - No one is going without you! I was trying to rest... Stop! Deep breath. One more time. - Teacher. - Excellent! Let's meet in 20 minutes on the shooting range. Dismissed! - Senior. - Yes? You're sweating so much. Are you hot? Thank you. - Let's go, teacher. - No. Go with the rest. Moriwaki, I'll wipe your face. It's so hot... Really now. Hit! Sanchū! Ref! We can't hear you! Hit! Sanchū! Hit! Kaichū! Not bad, Hanaoka. I'm just trying to emulate you, senior. You sure are talented, Hanaoka. You're the freshers' hope. Now, they're pampering her. No wonder, she's been practising since middle school. That burikko keeps showing off to the boys! - Relax your shoulders. - Yes! Breathe and relax. Shall we count it as an hicchū? Loser! Stop being noisy! I can see everything from here! The full view! - You fool, you fool! - Those guys! - O-Kyon! - You scared me! O-Kyon! Do you feel for the boys? You're so gloomy. All right! All right. - What is it? - I have a toothache! You shouldn't have eaten so much. - Thanks for your sympathy. - I'm out of here. Hurts so bad! I told you, you shouldn't have eaten so much. Good morning. Fight! - Did you bring what I asked for? - That thing? - Yes, but only one pack. - Give it to me. - These are mine... - Hurry up! I owe you. Leave some to me. I will, don't worry. Ah, it feels nice! - Senior, I need to take a leak. - Okay, go. Senior, who's that? Hotoke, are you from Okayama? From Wakayama...? Takayama...? - So, where from? - From Takayama. I don't know much about it. A suicide note was found on the scene. Good that the body was found so soon. If the body had been in the woods longer, there would be only bones left. Right, manager? It was all thanks to your report, guys. - Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you. By the way, not far from there... We found this. It proved to be an important clue. In the end, the two were forced to confess. As punishment, they had to go without food for a day. They had a whale of an appetite the next day. His neck was bent. And the body was soft like a jellyfish. He couldn't even die a cool death. The dead don't care. - It's the third dead body I've seen. - You didn't even see anything. When I was in primary school, I saw my dead grandparents. A funeral doesn't count. - You can electrocute yourself. - What if a fire breaks out? Who will put it out? - What fire? - Don't be stupid. I'm sick of it... By the way, when you hang yourself, you throw up everything you've eaten. That's a sordid story... Mita, don't eat so much, or you will throw up without hanging yourself. Four days of intensive training are over. Tonight, we will celebrate it by making a bonfire. Everybody! During the last training, I expect everyone to do their best. - Got it? - Yes. And one more thing. Don't get discouraged, no matter what. - Understood? - Yes! Hit! Nichū! Hit! Hicchū! Here we go again... Oh! Well done! You did great! Teacher, you too? - What is this? - Thanks for the contribution. - Is this angel a dead baby? - Sort of. - So, it's a contribution to a murder. - A baby is not a human yet. And yes, only you and Beniko refused to donate. Beniko, too? I'm home. There you are. What are you doing? - Why are you dressed like that? - I felt like it. Soon, they'll be too small for me. Hey, what are you doing up here? What do you usually do when you come here? Nothing. Just looking in the distance. So, that's what your father is doing, too. All right, then. Hey, it's a nice view, isn't it? - The wind feels nice. - Yeah. Aiko, have you seen your father? - He's up here with me. - Join us, Mum. Climb on. Like father, like daughter. - Join us. - Don't be stupid. Aiko, your friend is calling. - Which one? - Hiratsuka. Gonbe? I'll be right back. Not Gonbe. It's Hiratsuka. Shihono Hiratsuka. Shio from Shihono. Gomashio from Shio. Gonbe from Gomashio. Got it? - How was the camp? - As usual. I didn't hit the mark, even once. No matter how hard I try, it's no use. I'm sick of it. So, maybe you should give up kyūdō? But you can't, can you? You haven't been seeing him lately. Your boyfriend, from when you were in middle school. Well, you know who I mean. But he ran away from our school, didn't he? At first, I felt lonely. - But, then, I was even relieved. - Rabu-tan, you're weird. Here, sorry to make you wait. - I haven't seen you since middle school. - Sorry we haven't visited you, grandma. You're so welcoming, it's embarrassing. Oh, come on. What are you saying? How about you chat with us? You must be bored. I don't have time. Someone has to put bread on the table. I heard he has a nice motorbike. - Who? - Him. Looks like he's joined a biker gang. I see. You don't care about him. Why do you seem so upset? I'm not upset. I just don't care. So, you two have split up? By the way, Rabu-tan... - He's been really gloomy lately. - You too, grandma? Why should I care? It's over between us. Don't make a mistake, Rabu-tan. All the children who come here talk about various things. I'm not behind the times, but I don't understand some things. Splitting up, cheating... you see? It's Mita. Long time no see. How have you been? Well, fine. Do you have good grades? No. I just can't focus. - You know what... - What? I'm so tired. And I have no one to talk to. The only ones around are those I'd rather fight with. Mita, hearing your voice put me at peace. Is it true that you have a motorbike? I'm not going to ask you for a ride. Just be careful. Let's stop here, okay? Just like that? Why so suddenly? If you have a new girlfriend, that's fine. I don't want to be a substitute. I understand. I'm so sorry. Finally, a new semester begins today. The second semester is the time to study and play sport, the time to learn about the arts, and the time when all the food seems tasty and you can't get enough of it. The weather is on our side. And that means there will be lots of events, contests and festivals. I believe that will give each of you a chance to have the time of your lives. As for our third-graders, for them it's an important preparation stage for entrance exams. You will have to work hard. And apply all the skills you've gained over the past two years in this school. Now is the time to do your best. We expect each one of you to demonstrate even more assiduity. Miss Mita! Stop running down the corridor! You have too much energy. Watch your step. - You can go. - Sorry. Who was that? You don't know her? It's teacher Aiko Shimazaki. - She's from Tokyo. - Is she new? You have the same name as her. Except her name is written in kanji and yours in katakana. By the number of lines, you lost. - Come on! The teacher isn't going to wait. - Cut it out! Hurry up! I told you to hurry up! - What if the teacher is already there? - I don't know. - Who cares? Then, we'll both get scolded. - I don't want that. Hit! Sanchū! Hit! Nichū! Hit! Kaichū! She came third in the national competition. I mean, teacher Shimazaki. Pull the elbow back. Like that. Hit! Nichū! - It's you, Miss Mita, right? - Yes. Want to have a go? - Keep it tight. - Yes. - Miss Mita, don't get distracted. - Yes, I'm sorry. Relax. Well, try again from the beginning. Teacher, thank you so much. Looks like I got the hang of it. Congratulations, Miss Hanaoka. "Congratulations, Beniko." "If you don't learn how to do it," "the world of female sports will be closed to you." "Come on, smile." "Congratulations, Beniko." If you're late, you better not come, at all. Being on time is a shared responsibility between freshers. Ah, it's so hot... What's wrong? I don't know what I should do with my life. Why? Being sincere means you'll lose in the game of life. Why is everyone so taken in by Beniko? - You're too weak. - Me? Weak? You can't be all things for all people. Let others criticize you behind your back for your fake or selfish behaviour. What matters is finding a man who will support you and living a happy life. Look, just like they're saying on TV. ♪ Mean, mean, you're so mean, but I still love you ♪ But, you know, in the kyūdō class, my senior, my teacher and all the other guys are great. But there's one female fox who's trying to deceive all of them. If you don't like that, then calmly accept it and support them. Or maybe you think you don't have to help others? Hurry up, Gonbe! - Morning! - Hold on, Gonbe! I love both my parents and most of my teachers. I respect them. But I can't trust them. In trying to demonstrate their love, they are extracting the most intimate things in my heart, and throwing them away like garbage. Isn't that right? Nature and culture. Very well. It is believed these two things are opposed to each other. But, you know, I try to think of them as one. Nature is always in the making. And that ensures the existence of this Earth that we inhabit. Nature gave rise to culture. But can it be the other way round? We, residents of Earth, should never forget that nature is all around us. If nature is damaged in any way, our existence is also in danger. Thus, nature and culture are deeply connected. That's why it's important for us to develop in harmony with nature. - Right, Miss Mita? - Yes! I personally believe that you shouldn't use an electric toothbrush. - People should use their hands more. - Here we go again... That's right. Am I right? You have to sharpen pencils with a knife and wear shoes with shoelaces, not velcro. If we don't do that, we risk losing control of our limbs. Are you nuts? Okay, that's enough. Let's get on with our lesson. Open your books at page 80, from a cell to an animal. - Teacher, we finished cleaning. - Well done. That's so cute! - I envy you. - Why is that? You're so young. Oh, come on, teacher, it's not like you're a grandma! Teacher, they are hatching. Okay, let's have a look. Come here, everyone. They are hatching. - They're so cute. - I don't like them... - Hey, Mokku... - What? What are the boys doing? I'm so tired. And today I'll be back late again. Ah, they're so sneaky... Let the boys do the other half. We, girls, take such things much more seriously. There's one exception, though... By the way, where's that burikko? Maybe flirting with boys again? Here she comes! I see you're busy. Good. - Busy doing what? - You're late. Your part of the work is waiting for you. You didn't clean it for us? Are you stupid? We did our part. Now, you have to do yours. Good luck. Hey, you're not being very nice. Everyone's being so mean. Oh, well... I'll give you a hand. - Really? - I have nothing better to do. We should do it, too. Shall we? You should all learn from Hanaoka. Beniko! Shame on you! Exactly. You skipped your part, too. Where have you been? - Who cares? - I do. Everyone worked hard, but you should at least give us a justification. There's no justification. It's none of your business, anyway. - You're so ungrateful. - Miss Mita, wait a moment. Why are you getting involved, teacher? Because it's my business, too... - I'm fed up with this! - Miss Mita! Mum! Give me a straight answer at least today. - Where's your "I'm home"? - I'm home. Mum, the situation is getting out of hand. If you think that living like Beniko will benefit me, then you're wrong, and I refuse to do it. - And, then, what you'll do? - I'll die. Then, go ahead and die. You won't be able to do it. Just see me try, then! If Beniko doesn't disappear, I will! Mum! Mum, look, I cut my wrist! Where? Show me! That's nothing. What's with this foolish behaviour? Didn't you tell me to die? You don't get jokes, do you? Good that you cut it in the wrong place. It's just a small cut. If you want to kill yourself, you should cut your vein right here. You should be glad, Mum. If I'd cut it there, you'd be crying by now. It was just a joke! Most people who cut their wrists are simply trying to get attention. Are you pushing your daughter towards suicide? Show some respect to your parents. Okay, I'll just follow your advice, and be serious for a bit. So, Aiko, why do you hate her so much? To be honest, everything annoys me about her. When Beniko is alone, I kind of want to talk to her. But, then, when I see how she behaves, I get annoyed every time. And how exactly does she behave? She's a hypocrite. She pretends to be innocent. And she lies to teachers. Also, she's a lecherous girl who sucks up to our senior. I guess that's just the way it's gotta be. Maybe Beniko just doesn't realize she behaves like that? Are you satisfied with "that's just the way it's gotta be"? - What can I do? - If Beniko doesn't notice it, maybe you can draw her attention to it? Good morning. When I went in for kyūdō at your age, I had a very critical teacher. He died last year, actually. His favourite phrase was: "The trajectory of the arrow reflects the trajectory of your heart." "When the arrow flies in a straight line, or in a curve, it says a lot about the person who shot it." "Therefore, be honest and sincere with your bow." That's what he used to tell me. At that time, I thought it was some old-people nonsense. But now I understand the meaning behind those words. - Have you done your maths? - Damn, I forgot! Let me copy yours! What are you doing, Rabu-tan? - We've been looking for you. - I'm chilling. Why are you alone? Hey, what do you have here? - I cut my wrist. - On purpose? What for? Were you serious? I kinda wanted to die, but not anymore. Before I die, I wanted to take part in a competition and win a prize. Rabu-tan, it would be easier for you to kill yourself than to hit the mark. - Hey, that's so mean! - That hurts, Rabu-tan! Oh my gosh, I forgot my homework! Do you want to come with me? - No, thanks, I have a bike. - Is that so? Aiko! - Hey, Aiko! - Ah, Dad... You're soaked! What is that? Who's that for? Let's go. Right, it's Mum's birthday! Say, Dad! Hey, when did you and Mum get married? Why are you asking it now? Your marriage was out of love, right? Yours and Mum's. In case you're wondering, yes. So, when was it? Tell me! Well, let me see, it was three years before you were born. - What month was it? - It was in the middle of winter. - It was snowing. - What was the date? When was it, exactly? Oh my gosh, have you forgot? I keep forgetting things with the life that I have. - So, that's how it is? - Yup, you bet! - I wonder if Mum is happy? - I guess she is. Are you sure? It's not every day you get to walk alone with your daughter, Dad. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is that you, Aiko? It must be. It's Aiko, right? - Are you stupid? - Cut it out! I can't believe it. - It must be false, right? - It's impossible. Teacher Shimazaki is alive. Anyway, I can't tell you any more than I already have. Let's start our lesson. Teacher, was it a suicide attempt? - Tell us. - Are you sure she's alive? Which hospital is she in? Teacher, we need more information. - Tell us everything! - That's right, tell us! Teacher, you know everything, don't you? Is it really true that Shimazaki is pregnant? I'm not going to address rumours! Teacher Shimazaki is a human being. She also has a life outside school. She's the same as everyone else. She has a private life. Are life and death connected? I feel sorry for her... Nonsense. I had a feeling about teacher Shimazaki. It takes courage to kill yourself. What are you talking about, dumbass? It doesn't take an ounce of courage to kill yourself! That means there's no hope for anyone who dares to do it. How can you save a dead person? I refuse to believe that teacher Shimazaki gave up. But, still, I won't forgive her. Why can't you have sympathy for her? You may say that human life is just a tiny grain in the universe. But it's the other way round! Even though the universe is vast, and the beings that inhabit it are so small, humans are much greater, and their life is much more precious! We only have one life! You do know that! All of us accepted challenges and took responsibility for our actions. Isn't that enough? I understand that teacher Shimazaki may have suffered as well, but wouldn't it have been better for her to go on living? I like teacher Shimazaki and I don't want her to die! I want her to live! So, stop talking about her like that. You all liked her, didn't you? I'm begging you... - Excuse me, where's Aiko Shimazaki's ward? - It's over there, 305. Thank you for coming. - I almost thought... - Thought what? I thought you were in a more serious state than this. - Please eat this, teacher. - Thank you. This is Nozomi from the next ward. Hello. This girl right here is Aiko Mita, understand? Ah, you have a nice toy. Do you want to play with me? That's right. We are namesakes. Thank you. Look, teacher, it's so beautiful! - When you grow up... - Huh? Things that used to be hidden behind walls and fences that you couldn't see, start to slowly open to your eyes. When I was a kid, I thought there were sparkling lakes, and fields of flowers on the other side. I was really convinced of it. But, in reality, it was just a a patch of wilderness, and a garbage dump. I knew it all along. Still, I was taken aback by that ugly view. Frankly speaking, I don't want to get any older. Ah, it's such a wonderful feeling! - Isn't she great? - Huh? I mean, our teacher. - It's so cute. - It really is. Come here. ♪ Silent night, holy night ♪ All is calm, all is bright ♪ Miko... Miko... Miko! Miko! Move back! Move back! Beniko! Beniko! Beniko! Aiko... Aiko, what is it? She's back, honey! Get down here! Aiko, let's go inside. Come on, let's go. Honey! Welcome back. Aiko, where have you been? It's dark outside... Aiko... Mum, I can't take it anymore! I can't take it anymore! - I can't... - Aiko, what is it? I can't! I've had enough! I don't want anyone to die, please... Don't let anyone die anymore... I beg you... I still believe in myself. Not in some end goal, but in the strength inside me. I am myself. I'm not a flame that lights up and goes out in an instant. I'm a fire that will keep burning fuelled by my inner strength. Come on, let's reach the skies! Directed by: Akiyoshi Imazeki THE END
