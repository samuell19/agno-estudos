This is the story of a gang of boys in 1920s Oslo. They roamed the streets and stole coconuts from lorries - a dangerous game during the strike. Everybody called them... STREET URCHINS You go down that way. You go up. - The other side of the street. - Shouldn't I...? H?na, go around the corner. Karsten, in the corner. He'll be here soon, I think. Beat it. The Ogre is driving. You saw, who it was. He was bleeding. - Grandma! - The police will make you talk. Come on in. - Did they catch Gotfred? - No, he'll be alright. They took Sofus, and he didn't do anything. The cops will be at school tomorrow. Did you think Sofus will squeal? He wouldn't dare. - But there'll be trouble. - We'll wring his neck. There is a lot of blood here. The knife slipped when I ran. Gotfred's hand got in the way. He can't come to school with a cut on his hand. He's probably better off staying away from school. - You weren't even there. - And you know why. Not when his dad is driving a coconut lorry. Why are you staring at that knife? - Did he bleed a lot? - I guess so. And the knife had been in the coconut bag? - He'll get blood poisoning. - What? - This is poisoned blood. - You're out of your mind. He's going to get coconut poisoning. We have to get rid of all evidence. - We should return Gotfred's knife. - He gets nervous without it. We have to be there for Gotfred. Mum's got iodine. Do you think, that'll help? - Where have you been, Karsten? - I've been out. - Grab this, if your hands are clean. - Why wouldn't they be clean? Something's wrong. What is it? Wrong? It's easy to see. Let me look at your hands. - Yes, it's blood, mum. - Did you cut yourself? Gotfred's bleeding. He needs iodine. - It's nothing serious. - What's wrong? - There's no time. Where is it? - In the back. I'll tell you about it when I come back. Gotfred? I've got iodine. Use it, or you'll get blood poisoning. Answer me. I've got your knife and some coconut. It wasn't my fault. My knife slipped. Stay away from school tomorrow. Your cut will give you away. Roll up your sleeves. It's just a boil. I've had it for days. For the last time, put your hand up if you stole the coconut. Gotfred's not here today. - He wasn't here yesterday. - He's got a sore throat. We've been through the whole class, Sofus, - and you still haven't got anything to say. Answer me, boy. - But Sofus didn't do anything. - Someone's got to take the fall. He was fiddling with the drainpipe. He hasn't fixed it yet. - That doesn't matter. - We can't use him like that. Use? Why do you say that? This is all against one. Bastard! You want to give everybody a bath? What an idiot. Look what he did. He's getting back at us for puncturing his hose. I'm completely soaked. Reidar. Guilty conscience, eh? Do you think the horses will be poisoned - because your knife was in their feed? - Idiot. - Dimwit. - Buffoons. - H?na. Give Sofus his tools back, when he drops by. I don't want your knife either. You have to bring a note to school. - Who's going to write that? - Your mum, I suppose. What will happen if the teacher visits Gotfred at home? He's going to be put in a boys' home. In a boys' home? That's what they call a social conscience. Why does my mum have to write that note? You stabbed him. Your mom has to take care of him. Otherwise, our gang is lost. Can't his mother write that note? She's never at home. So he's all alone? He has to fend for himself. What would your father have said, if he was here? It has to be this way. - Does it? What about Sofus? - I knew you would say that. But this is about all the lads, not just me. I'm not alone in this. - We have to... - What? We have to stick together. Do you have to steal coconut? We're just filching. It's not stealing. I wasn't stealing. But Sofus wasn't even involved. That's because Sofus is a weakling. Where are you going? That weakling took the rap for you. Don't tell me to be more like Sofus. I'll be the laughing stock of the street. Are you going out? Sit here until I get back. Don't go near the gas or the window. - Show me where Gotfred lives. - Just write a note. If I write, I'll take care of him, then I shall take care of him. Is he going to stay here? I can't compete with the street. I know what you're going to say. Don't worry. When I'm an apprentice, I'll stop hanging out in the street. Let's just go to Gotfred's. - Tell your father, who was involved. - No, I can't. - Why not? - Shall we...? Discuss the realities? You go first. The Ogre is a coconut driver. You're a coconut driver. You stick together. The boys steal coconuts. Stop banging on the table. You're teaching him bad manners. - Who gets to speak here? - Your mother. I'm a street kid, but I can't steal coconuts, - because you're a coconut driver. We stick together. But if the Ogre asks, who was involved, - I have to side with the boys. I'm teaching them solidarity. - Listen... - I'm still speaking. You can't feel solidarity towards both... All this discussion will drive boy insane. Here's your hammer and your file. That's it. Now I have to clean up in here. - Can I look at the tools? - You've seen them a million times. I'll be really careful. If you drop anything, I'll give you a beating worse than the Strangler. I didn't mean it, Sofus. I know what it's like to be beaten. Can I take some? I want to be a tinsmith. You'll just fall off the roof. Let me see your arms. Aren't they strong enough? I'm just more sinewy. That's why my arms are skinnier. See this? This is Karsten's knife. It gave Gotfred coconut poisoning. This blade. He swelled up like a balloon. He may die. Do you know what happens then? Then he'll be buried in the cemetery next to your mother. - Does it still sting? - A little. - Get your other nightshirt. - I want my slippers first. Gotfred needs them until he goes to bed. My feet are wet. I could catch a cold. Do as I say. This is only good for soap. - They think we're washerwomen. - It hasn't been edible for days. We have to wait till a new boat comes in. - There'll be plenty of coconut milk. - That's not what Gotfred says. - It's harvest time. - Stop that. Remember when we planted a coconut on his mother's grave? Shut up. - You can bring this home to Gotfred. - Gotfred doesn't need anything. me and Maggedutti drove 275 miles with a pram full of frutti Maggedutti and me, hey That was funny. Your dad has come home to his little girls. with a pram with a pram - The record's scratched. - That's my seat. Are you talking back to your father? Don't touch my hand. Well, I never... - Give me the coconut. - I didn't get any. - The coconut is only good for soap. - You're lying. I'll find your mother. I won't rest until I do, so you can go back, where you belong. I won't come back until I find her. - Come peep through the holes. - The match is about to start. What's wrong with him? My hole is almost as big as Gotfred's now. If you make it bigger than Gotfred's he'll just take it from you. Look at Sofus' tiny mouse hole. He can't even see the ball through it. Now you see it - before your very eyes. There is a class distinction. Just wait until the strike begins. Things will heat up. And there won't be a strike if everybody has equally sized holes? If you only knew what a good question that was. Have you seen Mrs. Halvorsen? Did he say "Mrs."? If you go home, your mum will be there soon. You'll find her at the garden allotments. Good luck. Do you snore at night? Are you afraid I'll wake your horse? No, but there are rats here. Snoring is the only thing, that'll save your nose. I'll remember that. When will your father be here? Six o'clock. - I'll be gone by then. - Don't you want a blanket? I'll manage. This is nice and soft. But now that Gotfred is at your place, and his mum is arrested, - isn't his place empty then? - How will I get in? - Gotfred keeps a key under the mat. And you've got to protect your nose. Aren't you allowed to go home? None of your business. Beat it. You can sleep at our place. Have you no shame? - Karsten? - Why should I be ashamed? Because you chased him out of here. Now he'll have to walk the streets tonight. I refuse to go home until Gotfred's left. I'll live like he did. - But Gotfred's life was hell. - Can't I steal coconuts? Can't I scrounge cake crumbs and pinch oranges on the docks? Do think that only Gotfred can do that? Once I found some dates at the docks. Arabs live on dates. - He's going in the right direction. - I'll jump off at Kut?rjet. Gotfred will get his compensation. You've talked about Gotfred getting his compensation - because he is forced to steal to live, but he steals for himself. Because he's used to it now. Why are oranges so good? The merchants feed them to their kids. - Orange merchants? - All merchants. We'll trick them. Look at this second-rate orange. Give me a fresh merchant's one. Eat them before his kids get them. This boy can roll oranges. There it went. - Reidar, what's "compensation"? - Compensation? Don't you see, that I've got a shirt full of compensation? Here. I've got so much compensation that I look like Andersen in the milk store. This is only the beginning. Watch out, they'll see us. You said it. "Watch out". When we've won, it's them who'll have to watch out. We'll own the docks and all the ships. Like that big one there. It's ours. And all the oranges are ours. We'll share all the boats with everyone involved. - You're quite the speaker. - Don't you agree? Yes, but I don't think I'll like it. - I just want to be an electrician. - You'll get a job? - When school is out. - Where? I don't know. - My mum wouldn't like handouts. - Why not? She wants to cope on her own like she's always done. You should see her at the end of the month like now. She sneaks up to the store, so no one will see, how tight things are. She dreads going in. Sometimes she's only got 50 ?re to spend. I'm afraid she'll find out that I know. She's so proud. That's how it is for us, and Gotfred's got it even worse. - She's just shabby-genteel. - She just tries to get by. Wasn't that the guard's whistle? It was just the boss on one of the ships. Karsten, let me tell you. This misery won't last. When we've won, you can take your mum to town, - and I'll take my mum to town and we'll go to the fancy stores - and get them patent leather shoes, feather boas and silk trousers. Going home to your mummy? - Give me those oranges. - Get them yourselves. Get him! Drown him in the trough. Get his face in there. - What are you doing? - Almost finished. - What are you doing? - Saving your life. Was I dead? You drowned. - You can let go of my leg now. - Just a few more to be sure. Did you take off my shoes? - I had to. - Did it help? Yes. I also tried taking off your trousers. You're quite a life saver. - Did they take the oranges? - Yes. They ran, and then I came. - Are you following them? - No, I was at the tinsmiths'. - Aren't you a tinsmith, Sofus? - I will be. - Your face is so clean. - That's what drowning does to you. Bye. Sofus. Come here. Don't be so nice all the time. They'll just use you. - "They"? - Them and me and everybody else. You can't do what everybody says. See this watering can? You don't water in the rain, do you? Do you see, what I mean? Use your head. Ask yourself why. Or else people will use you. Come here. Put down the watering can. Punch me in the face. Don't you understand, I've been mean to you, and you need to punch me? Hit me. Come on. Punch me. I can't be friends with you, if you don't punch me in the face. Come on. Was that a caress? Hit me as hard as you can. We can't be friends unless you do it. That's it. - You're really strong. - Are we friends now? We're friends, and do you know, what we'll do now? I'll get an apprenticeship. And when you've finished school, I'll help you get one. Maybe we can work in the same place. I'll bring my salary back home every Friday. We'll go to the movies, - and I'll buy chocolate. "Give me some almond bars." You hear? I'll buy you a boa. Do you want some silk trousers? Do you? - Why so sad, mum? - How many slices? Why are you so sad? Did he take all our money? Yes he did. Now I understand how little I know about the street. You could bring me along. But it's just us boys and the street. You wouldn't understand. - I understand you, don't I? - Yes, but... Don't worry about the street. I know the street. I've got it under control. Is it because he took all our money? - How many slices did you want? - Two. I ate a lot of oranges. That's not enough for an electrician. You'll see. It's the world's best job. As soon as school's done, I'll run down to the newspaper. On my first payday I'll buy an entire baker's van. - Nothing yet? - Beat it. - Looking for a full-time job? - I guess. There are only part-time jobs these days. They're pushing pennies. Go back to school. - Leave my buddy alone. - There it is. Stay away from my bike! An electricity company. Let's get out of here. It's back there. It's already taken. - You are honest, right? - I won't steal anything. - He looks honest, Pedersen. - Yes. - And he is healthy? - He looks healthy. If you are honest, you'll get a job with prospects like Pedersen. I can fix things as well. You'll get 20 kroner a week. Stand still, Pedersen. You can begin right away. Go wait in the storage room. What do you want, boy? Can I stay here during the summer? Stay here? It's just that... My best friend works around here. I want to be a tinsmith. Find something that pays better than these thin sheets of tin. - I can carry things for you. - You can hold the sheet. Then I can cut it, but then you must leave. You won't have to pay me. That's very generous, but I don't need any help. I can manage on my own. I can clean up and such. All I do is drink, my friend. I can't even clean that mess up myself. Now we'll cut it. Thank you, kid. Now run along. Go home to your mother. Get out of this rat hole. If I had known I would be a tinsmith at that age, - then I wouldn't have become a tinsmith. Can you believe my luck? An electric company. - Are they nice? - They're not bad. It's a job with prospects. I'll be an apprentice. Even though it's only 20 kroner a week, things will get better. I don't want anymore. I don't have the time. From now on tell me, when you or the girls need anything. I'll think of something. I'll do my best. I mean it. - What is it? - It's a lockout. - Why are you saying that now? - Just be ready. - I'm going to work tomorrow. - Be ready. There's never any peace. - You can't expect that. - I don't want any trouble. - You'll know when it happens. - I can still feed the horse, right? All right. "...from the workers' perspective. Police are standing by to protect those willing to work. Many people think, they'll help keep businesses going." Go to hell. Are you sabotaging this? - I've called the strike. - Go to bed. You go to sleep. I'll watch the street. The scabs may drive in the middle of the night. Don't fall asleep, my son. Trust me. Karsten. Let's stop running. - We'll hop on a car. - But it's early. I don't want to be late on my first day of work. - It's so quiet. - There are no cars. Because of the lockout? Do you think the tinsmith will let me stay? - Do me a favour. - What is it? You know the shelf with the light bulbs? My thermos is in there. Will you get it? - Is it you...? - I worked here, but I quit. - I just forgot my thermos. - You quit? - I can't waste any more time. - What do you mean? I worked there for two years, and I never got an apprenticeship. - I'm going to be an electrician. - Then we're in the same trade. - But they won't make you one. - They said I had prospects. They told the guy before me the same. They told me the same. Just wait until you begin bothering them. Don't leave the boxes open. Something could break. - What are you going to do? - What do you think? It's quiet now, but some day it'll all explode. Get the thermos. - Do you think I'll be an apprentice? - No. - Don't you think? - Can't you take a joke? Is the hot plate done? Here. Sweetie. The madam is waiting. Haven't you left yet? Is it this one? See that door? See the guy listening there? He's sneaky, that Pedersen, so watch out. - Do you know Reidar? - He's a friend of mine. He said, you're helping them get the Ogre tonight. He's a scab. He nabbed my buddy, Sofus. He's a bastard. Haven't you forgotten something? The police! They said they would burn down the coconut driver's garage. - Now they've done it. - What have you done, Karsten? I didn't want to get involved. I thought I heard a scream after I had thrown... - What did you throw? - A brick. I threw it at the Ogre, who nabbed Sofus. He is still driving coconuts in spite of the strike. Go wash your hands. Did you light the fire as well? No, grown ups did that. The cops are after them. The police will get you, too, some day. I don't want to go to jail, now I have a job. I'm done with the street. I want to be an apprentice. I just want to be left alone. - Karsten! - Isn't that Reidar? What are you shouting for? The boys are meeting tomorrow night. We'll do the lorries. - You heard it. - I heard, what you heard. - You don't seem surprised. - I've grown used to it. You do think, I'll get an apprenticeship, right? - Sure. - All right. Listen, mum. Should I throw rocks or become an apprentice? Never throw rocks, Karsten. What if I don't have a choice? What if they trick me at the store? They would be using me. Then I have to join the boys and throw rocks. They're poor. They don't have much. They struggle to survive, just like us. Are you crying, mum? Don't cry. I won't throw rocks. I'll get an apprenticeship. Please, mum. After work today, I'll just ask her. - Bye. - Bye. - Didn't you pack a lunch? - I probably won't need it. I told you not to give up. He'll be pleased, now that you've soldered his tub. Here's something to eat. Okay, let's go. You don't give up, kid. And you've brought lunch. And you can solder. Do you know how to fix drainpipes? I've done it for years. I'm a specialist. I've repaired all the drainpipes at home. Do you like watering cans, buckets, boxes, pails and garbage cans? Yes. Okay, get me some coffee then, so we don't have to eat lunch dry. That's enough, Sofus. You can call it a day. You can come back at seven o'clock tomorrow morning. I won't be late. And tell your mother to wrap your lunch. Grandmother. Is your mother... gone? Sofienberg Cemetery. - And your father? - He used to live with us. But then he just left. - Was he like this? - Yes. Don't forget that this is for eggs, - but don't be mad at the tinsmith, because he's forgotten it. He has forgotten it. You'll be a great craftsman because you love tools. You can go home now, if there aren't any more deliveries. Everything is delivered. - I wanted to ask you something. - Well? Will I be an apprentice here? You want to be an apprentice on your second day? I just wanted to know for sure, if I was going to be an apprentice. - I said you would have prospects. - Yes, but... Can you guarantee an apprenticeship? - Did you say guarantee? - That's what I said. Pedersen, you need to run down to the paper. Unfortunately yes. I can run down there. - The usual ad? - "Bright boy" and "prospects", yes. Here you go. 6,5 kroner. I don't expect you to be grateful. I can't be here anymore? Pedersen, get him out of here. I'm going up to Reidar and the other boys. Lots of hooligans here. Sit down, boys. LOCKOUT MAKERS Get rid of your knives if the cops arrive. Get rid of your knives if the cops arrive. It's coming. - It's coming. - It's coming! - Let's get him. - Charge! The police are coming! - Age? - 15. - What's your father's name? - Rolf Olsen. - Occupation? - Driver. He's on strike now. - Electricians must stick together. - Lorang Kristoffersen, 16. - Address? - 5 Hesselsberggata. - Father's name? - Hans Kristoffersen, iron worker. We're even, Gotfred. - Get out, kid. - I want to be arrested. Pigs. Reidar Gundersen, 15. 10 G?teborggata. - Occupation? - None. They saw to that. - Father's name and occupation? - Olaf Gundersen. Coconut driver on strike. Just put me behind bars. Not this time. Next. You there. Step forward. You pulled a knife against the police. Is that right? Father's name? He lives with his mum. Go sit down. - My name is Gotfred Halvorsen. - Sit down. Excuse me. Next. - It wasn't his fault. - Name? It wasn't his fault. He's no worse than the rest of us. - Name? - I stab people, too. - One looks out for one-self. - What is your name? Karsten Andersen, 15. 22 G?teborggata. My father's name is Ingolf, and he's a sailor. Occupation? - Electrician's apprentice. - Next. Bye, Gotfred. Karsten. I found this in the street. Isn't it Gotfred's? You can take over Gotfred's hole. - They've boarded them up. - What? And that hole was all he had. It doesn't matter to me. I can't use that hole anyway. I wanted to be there, but I had to go to the cemetery. Can we afford to take the chance? - Did you water at the cemetery? - No, it'll rain soon. You're learning. They just turned the street lights on. They'll be here any minute. Look. The world's best job for sure.
