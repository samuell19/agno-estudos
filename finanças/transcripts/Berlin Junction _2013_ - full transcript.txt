There is a German philosopher, I don't give a fuck what his name is, but what he says is, when a woman wants to have a child with a man, it's because she fucking loves him. PpIt's all about the love man. There's nothing else but love. If you don't get that, then get the fuck off man. - One, two three, four. - It pisses me off man. When men, they just loose all their balls ppbecause of this thing, they think called love. They say love is a drug, love isn't a drug. Pp Love is a fucking virus. It just goes from person ppto person, fucks you up and leaves you pathetic like that. Lost in the fucking bushes with the dog shit That's where love leaves you man. Well, hey, if you come here for advise, ppyou're in the wrong department. I don't do advise. I'm not in the counseling business, I'm in a different business ok? Counseling is not my game.

You stick with me and things are going to be ok. I promise you. I guarantee you. And if they're not - Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I cut my own balls for you. How's that for commitment?

I haven't drunk in a long time. We are drinking, we are all... well. I have to tell you something. I am not pregnant. - Sorry, what? - What do you mean? - I'm not pregnant. What are you talking about? Of course you're pregnant. This is the whole reason we're here. We're drinking wine due to the pregnancy. This is what this is. Well, I did four pregnancy tests and three of them said - negative and one was... - No, but Jos came to us. He told us you're pregnant. - Uh, I like. - Show me. - This will look good on you. - Yeah? - You wanna try it on? - Maybe. - I can't believe I'm even shopping. - Do you guys wanna know? Or do you just wanna talk about fucking clothes all the time. We're not talking about clothes. We're talking about designs, my love. You know, she never goes out. I haven't seen her in a while. Yeah, she hasn't seen me in so long. Why would you tell him if you're not sure? Well, because I needed to tell somebody ppat that point, you know? You would've called us. I know. But he was the maybe baby's father, ppso I wanted to tell him. Maybe baby? Maybe baby? His reaction, I didn't like at all. He was really disrespectful. - We had this huge argument and I kicked him out. Pp - You kicked him out. - I kicked him out. So, we're gonna need more wine. Ok, let's play a game. I will say a word and you say the first word that pops into your head. Alright. Sex. - Julia. - Julia? I'm only supposed to say the first thing that pops up in my head. No, no, but I said sex and you said Julia. - That's a female name. - Yeah. - Wow! - You said one word... There's gonna be a second round, you said one word... Julia is this wonderful lady I met at work. We happened to have lunch at the same place and we kind of started talking. And it was before getting pregnant or after getting pregnant. - So, what?, you're gay now? - I'm not gay, I wouldn't say I'm gay. I was just trying out. Hello! Should I be offended that you didn't wanna try with one of us? - She's jealous. - She is, she's super jealous. I'm not... Because I didn't want that to get in between our friendship. So, what do you guys do? With like a Dildo involved? - Are we talking just dildo action? - No, no dildo. Fingers, lips. - She wants all the dirty details. - I want some details. I think I'm entitled to details. Well she went down on me like never a man before. - Like, brilliant. - Ah, poor Jos. Poor Jos. - No, no, no. For how long? - You mean in minutes? - Yeah - Well, until I came. - Until you came? - 10, 15 minutes. - That's good. - Yeah, that's good. Were you attracted to me when you met me? I am very attracted to you. But on a different level - You and your questions. - That's beyond the sex. - She's coming out of the closet. - No, no, there's no closet. There's no coming and going from closets. - When was the last time? - I don't know, six months seven weeks. - Oh, fuck. - What? - Six months! That's long. - That's long? - Six months. - Is that too long? - Are you joking? - No. But that's normal right? When you have kids. - I don't know - I don't have any kids. - And here we are again. Not everyone has Julias in their lives so they can go have extended orgasms with. - But do you... - I don't know, my body is not the same. I've pushed two living things from it. - You can do it to yourself. - You said you have a vibrator. - Yeah. - Do you use it? Yeah. - What are you gonna do with Jos? - I don't know. I kind of feel responsible for him. Since he came... - He's not a puppy. - No, but he moved to Germany because of me. And I asked him to move here with me from the States. So I kind of feel a little bit responsible. PpWe have been dating for some time, so. Are you sure you don't wanna be with him? Hey! Heeey! Jos? Hi Jos. - Do you remember me? - No, not really. You don't? - At the fountain. - And you were painting. Yeah, I was. - Do you still have your paintings? - Not with me, no. No, ok. It's a beautiful day. Isn't it a beautiful day? - Yes, it is. - Look at the trees. I like to sit near the trees because they make me feel really calm Trees. Doesn't that feel good? Does it? I'm not sure what I'm supposed to feel right now. I'm kind of a little bit in a in between world. You seem like a very sweet woman, but I'm not sure if you can help me right now. I'm not sure. Who do you think can help you? - God? - Ok, God. The thing is that God, ever since I was small he didn't hear me. Well, I think a lot of people feel that way. But it's funny that you should mention him, her, however you think of him, it. There's a saying. When I left you last time remember I said all shall be well? We can sing that. We can sing it really pploud and if you sing it over and over, after a while you just kind of feel that everything is gonna be ok. So, and then we dance around the trees. We don't have to dance around the trees. Yeah, we could. Alleluia! - If that makes you feel good, do it, yes. - No, it doesn't make me... - I'm mocking you. - Oh, you're mocking me? - Yeah, kind of, a little bit. - But, so you don't wanna sing with me? But, why? I don't understand why. I don't know what to tell you other thanPPthat after a while you willppsense it. - That is gonna be ok. - I don't think so. I think that's the biggest fucking lieppyou can tell to anyone. Really, I mean, if someone's life is not good and it becomes worse and worse, there is no light in the end of the tunnel. I mean, there is no God. There is nothing. It's emptiness. This is life. It's fucking emptiness. So, you are born and if there is a hell, then this is hell. - This is hell where we live. - Maybe. - No, I'm sure. - But hell has really nice trees. If that's the case. - Burning trees. - Oh, they're burning? I think you're a hippy. You look like a nice girl. There are some elderly people over there, ppyou can talk to them. No, they don't need my help. - Oh, they don't? - No. You need help. Fucking hippy. Can I order? A dÃ¶ner Kebap. Thanks. The last one. Yes, thanks. What do you say? - To eat right away? - Yes, thanks. You can choose which one you want to have for this. It's my payment for the Kebap. Whichever you like. Maybe she can help you. He wants to buy something but he doesn't haveWBRvo2rnRW8 some paintings. But the boss is not here and we want money. - How much is it? - Five euros, twenty cents. - I'm sorry, you know. - No, that's ok. If you have twenty cents I'll give you five euros. Thank you. Thank you. You don't recognize me? Ewa! How are you. - The last time I saw you was in America right? - Yeeeh. You were a little bit different. How are you? - I'm good. - Yeah? I'm good. Do you want a painting? - You're painting? - Yes - You're back into painting? - I'm back into painting, yeah. Show me. Let's go over there. I don't know if you like it. It's something I made. You can have one if you want. You can choose. - Really? - Yeah! You paid for my fruit. But, what are you doing here in Berlin? I moved in, into my Grandfather's apartment. - He died a couple of weeks ago. - Oh! And he left me the flat. And I moved in. I'm trying to... Wanna go for a walk? I missed you. I'm sorry that I was an asshole in the end. You should be. Luci! Where the fuck have you been man? All good yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah What's going on? As the German say. Here man, hold this. There's police everywhere. Take this. Don't fucking chew it this time. Look, we're gonna go to a club later but I've gotta fucking drop this off to mate up there, we'll do that and then we fucking go and party and you forget this fuckingppbeast of a woman man. Why do you let her do this shit to you? I don't know... How're you doing? Everything good, yeah? - I'm good. - Is the pill kicking in yet? Yeah. Fuck yeah. Look, I'm having problems with this guy. He's fucking me about with the money. You just wait here, enjoy some of the fucking comedy and I'll be back in about five minutes. - Ok - Just stay here though. Ok, Luci. Luci, Luci. I love having a guy with bad English introduce me. Hello people, how are you guys? You are already drunk sir, aren't you? Yeaah. Welcome to Rathaus NeukÃ¶lln. We've got some of the best English comedians in all of Berlin here to perform for you. Is that exciting to some people? - Oh, yeah. - Just a couple of people here, maybe over there in the back, is that exciting to you? Yeah! First guy coming to this stage is a very good friend of mine, if you know what I'm saying. Please welcome Luci. Where's Luci? There he is. Hello, how're you doing? Come on! How're you doing? My name's Luci. I've got to admit, I'm not really a stand up comedian I came hereppto sell Paul some drugs and I was like, can I come on stage? And he's like, yeah. So, that's why I'm here. I wish I'd taken some of those drugs as well. PpNo, but I'm also here because I wanna rant about my friend, yeah. Because I've been looking after my friend ppfor the last three days, my mate Jos. He's a really good friend of mine. PpBecause he split up - with his girlfriend. - Aaaah! Come on you heartless bastards. Aaaah! No, not aah. Yes! He split up with his girlfriend. And the craziest thing about my mate Jos is that he's thinking of going back - to his ex-girlfriend. - Fuck that. Fuck that! Totally my friend, I'll give you some ecstasy pplater, we're together. Because why the fuck would you go back to a relationship when you live in Berlin? You know what I mean? Because Berlin is the Willy Wonka Chocolate PPfactory of fit pussy. Isn't it? Pp It is the land of beautiful girls, I can say just now, there's so many beautiful women in this room. Berlin has black women, ppwhite women, green women. You get green pussy in Berlin. Just go to Marzahn. But my mate Jos, he has a choice at the moment. He's at a crossroads in his life where he can go into two separate trains. One train will take him back to his relationship. I call it prison train. And the other train is the Willy Wonka Chocolate factory Berlin pussy train. Which one would you take? Pp It's an obvious fucking decision. Isn't it? It's like me asking you, what do you want? PpDo you want a blow job from Scarlett Johansson? Or would you rather be angrily raped by a donkey-tiger? Which one would you want? And you don't wanna be angrily raped by a donkey-tiger because he has the dick of a donkey, but he has the claws of a tiger. But it is crazy. Ant the other crazy thing is, he's girlfriend, she started these troubles with him because she asked him to change. They've been going out for... How long have you guys been going out Jos? This is actually my mate Jos. So, how long were you guys going out? - Three years. - Three years! And three years of partying. They met ppat a Rave. They were both on Ecstasy. And they had good times. And after three years this girl turns on to him and says, I think you should stop doing drugs. For God's sake, we met on drugs, we spent three years doing drugs. It's like going out with a fat woman and after three years going I think you should be thin. Really, you should get fucking weightless. It's the same. It's ridiculous. PpJos, get up, Jos, come here. Sit there. Sit there Jos. Come on. Give him a round of applause. Sit there Jos. This is my boy. You can help him decide whether he should go back to his girlfriend. Yeah, so, if you think he should go backPPto a relationship that hepp doesn't wanna be in just because his girlfriend ppis pregnant, say, go back to your girl! - Go back to your girl. I like you guys. Now, if you think he should live his life, be true to himself, look after the baby occasionally. But you think he should just go and live his life, shout out, run away Jos! Run away Jos! I love you guys. My name's been luci. PpThank you very much. Bye. Thanks to Luci, my former drug dealer. What happened? What do you think? Oh, fuck. It's a nice place. Are you working here? What? Working? Yeah. What do you do with this stuff? I try to sell it. - I don't see water. - No. - Are you shy? - No, I'm shocked actually. - Shocked? - Shocked. - How late is it? - Aha. - No, how late? The time. - I don't know. - You don't know? - Just, relax. Yeah, no. I'm not. Actually, I'm fucked. So, actually I have to go to work and maybe, you know take a painting or something and thank you. I really have to work right now. - Can you please go? - Go? - Yeah, please go. - I don't want to go. I don't care if you wanna go or wanna stay, ppI just want you to go. - Is it true that you come from Amsterdam? Pp- Yes, that's absolutely true. - I love Amsterdam. - Yeah? Go to Amsterdam, go and go to Amstedam. Do you have a girlfriend? Does it matter? - Did we use a condom? - I don't know I take the pill anyway. - Don't worry. Relax. Come here. - No, fuck off. No. - Come here. - No, no, no. Are these the paintings that you make? - They are pretty different. - Yeah. - This and this. - Yeah, please just... - I wanna see this. - Yeah? You wanna see it? - Keep it. You can take it. - Oh really? Yeah, take it. If you go away. - This is nice - Yeah, go away. Which is the side? This? This is a woman! Yes, it's a fat woman. And now, take it, go and please, please. You became aggressive. Why? You see this as a joke. You think this is funny. It's not funny, it's not a joke. Did Luci pay you? Did he pay you for this? - I'm not an escort you know. - No, you're not? - No. Are you always so dramatic? - Yes, I am and... Nice, I like it. You want me to pose for you? No? Just go. - Are you sure... Just fucking go, go. PpPlease go. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck away. - You took the wrong drugs. Yeah. Get the fuck out of here. I understand why you are a friend of Luci. And you know why? Because you are... Just get the fuck out of my place! Please fucking go! Go! You know what? You're a looser. - Yes, I am. - Yeah, you are. - Go away whore. - And you know what I see? - You don't want to know right? - No. Just get the fuck away. Why would anyone want to stay in this planet with people like him? I mean, why are you running about gathering these idiots? It's my job to gather these, as you call idiots, as I call friends. - Friends? - Yeah, he's my friend. I care about him. I care what happens. That's why I'm doing this. You on the other hand are happy to fucking turn your back on this fella. - Who is the asshole then? - Turn my back on him? I mean, I wouldn't have seen him, only you brought him here. Exactly, you see. You won't help him. If he was to ask me for help I may consider it. PpBut this guy doesn't know what he wants. I know what he wants. He wants to be happy. PpHe wants to feel happy. He wants to feel something, yeah. He doesn't want to be told by a woman ppor society or anything that he's shit. Hold it, hold it, those who search forpphappiness are never fucking happy. Right? I told you that lots of times.ppWe learned it together man. - We already know. - Not everything we learned is true though. Once upon a time you used to think this was the life as well. Once upon a time you used to think this is the way forward. And you know what was different back then? You used to smile. - You used to be happy. - Fuck smiling man. And now, all I see is a frown. You call this living? I don't call this living. Man, last night he fucked the most amazing fucking bird. It was this cute little italian piece man. I tell you, just looking at her was getting my balls fucking bubbling PPlike a fucking tearing infernoppman. He managed to do her. - Come on with us tonight man. - No. Come on. If you don't come out with us tonight, ppcan you look after him for about an hour? - You're fucking joking me. - Come on. I'm not looking after your responsibility. Fuck away off man. - Look after him for just one hour. - No. I don't believe you Gotti. People are either big cats or they're gazelles. PpWhich one you wanna be? - I'm a big cat. - You're a fucking big cat. Totally. - You are a gazelle. - No way, fuck. I'm a leopard. You know what gazelles do man? - They're call leaping gazelles. That's their names. PpAnd why do they leap? They leap and jump higher so that I'm watching, they're telling me which one I should take. They're telling me, take my uncle, he's too old, he can't leap as high as me. Or take my little cousin, he's too young. That's what they're doing, that's what you're doing. You're leaping and leaping and making him more vulnerable. You're a fucking gazelle. Before he met me he was miserable. Before he met me his life was going down a cul de sac. No, no, before he met you he was creating life. I'm sorry. Why do you need this guy, what is your objective with this guy? It's a public service. That's what I do. - A public service? - Yeah. I'm, like the UN, NSPCC, Red Cross and Oxfam all rolled into one. I'm not doing it just for him, I'm doing it for this kid man. What is better? A father that is present and a fucking asshole or a father that is not present and is a fucking hero? W>RFJw2vfFJw2vNBj He will stay with this woman, he will try and raise this kid when he doesn't want to and the kid will fucking resent him. The same way as he will resent the kid. And you know what? - Oh! I see it - Let me finish. But if he's true to himself and he's true to this PPwoman and he's true to this kidpp and goes, I don't want this. I'm not ready. PpThe kid will respect him. We are like sharks. We are like great ppwhite sharks. When a great white shark, which is the bad boyppof the fucking ocean no one fucks with the great white shark. It decides what it wants to do. But as soon as he stops swimming, as soon as he stops, it fucking dies. And that's what happeningppto you Gotti you stopped swimming. - I am not a shark. - You stopped becoming a predator. And you're gonna sink to the bottom of the ocean and die. Yeah, I got it now. Makes sense. I see it all now. Very clearly, I've just seen it there, ppa lovely picture. I see Luci, I see underneath it, lonely. You're lonely man. That's why you have him running about PPwith you. You're fuckingpplonely. - No, I'm not. - Yes you fucking are. Look at you. You're fucking lonely. You can't go about this fucking world ppon your own... I'm not fucking lonely, right. I think you're going down the wrong road. PPYou're on a dead end with thispp - guy, man. Seriously. - Dude, we're in no road at all, man. We're on the "Ring Bahn" pp. And we're going round and round and we can decide when we wanna get up. - And when is that gonna be? - When it's the right station. Jos? Jos? Jos? - Hi. - Hey. - How are you? - I'm ok. - You've just been at the club? - Yeah. - Are you ok? - Yeah. - Did you have a good time? - Yeah. So, you're still drinking a lot? Doing drugs a lot? What's your definition of a lot? Well, let me tell you a story and I can give you something to compare it to. A long time ago when I was like in my twenties, I used to be a stripper. I know it's hard to believe now with all these dresses and stuff, but... - A stripper? - Yeah. And I had a boyfriend that, he was really nice to me and he didn't really liked that I was a stripper. But I didn't have anything else that I was good at, so. It made a lot of money, so that's what I did and he kept talking me out of it. At some point I got pregnant from him PPand he really wanted me to haveppa baby he really wanted a baby in the family and I ppdidn't think I was ready. I was really young you know. I kept sayingPPI don't know if I wanna keepppthe baby because I didn't think it was a good idea. But one day I'm coming out of work, one night. We have just closed PPand the manager went out pp the front of the place because that's where he parked and I went out the back because that's where I parked and we were the only two left. There were these guys that had been at the club PPall night making me reallypp uncomfortable like shoving money at me and it was really degrading the way they were talking to me. So I came out of the club and these guys were waiting for me and there's nobody else around. - So, you got raped. - Yeah. And I said I'm pregnant, please don't, W>Rvvfo and they didn't seem to care. So they all took turns raping me so I ended up loosing the baby because of that and then I wasn't able to have kids any more because they really messed me up. I couldn't cope at all after that and I kept thinking, if I'd just listened to Bobby, my boyfriend, maybe done something else as a job or something. I started to drink after that, and I drank and drank all the time. I was a total mess. And then six months after that Bobby got cancer and it just kind of took over his whole bodyPPand he ended up dying after appyear. So, I lost everything that mattered to me. I ended up homeless and then one day this... Well, I guess it was her. I woke up one day ppand I was in this beautiful room with fresh linens and it smelled like roses. Pp And this amazing African woman had picked me up and took me in I don't even know how she got me home. She took care of me and helped me get back to being able to function and live because I didn't have anybody else. She gave me this. - Can you read that? - Yes. It says "All shall be well". She told me that some day I would meet somebody that needed it more than I do and that needed to know that's gonna be ok and that I should just give it to that person. So, I wanted you to have it. And I just wanted you to know that you're not ppa bad man. I don't know if anybody's told you that you're bad, but you're not. You've just gotten lost a little bit. I just wanted you to have it. And maybe someday you'll meet somebody that needs it more than you do. Ok. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Ok, just remember what it says. - All shall be well. Take care. Where's our hero now? I'd say he's in a separation between that world over there and himself. He's going through a transitional period I think. You know I'm not your guard here. You're not gonna find love in this town. You'll find it in yourself if you look for it. You can be the hero, you know? You just got to unify yourself. Stop fucking about man. And you gotta get rid of luci. You have to kill him. You gotta get rid of everything that's not good for you. Everything that's not good for Jos. Hiros Chimus, unification of one self. That's what you need. Find the love in yourself, you're the hero.

You got a brand new Tattoo man. Sit up, sit up. Look. You've got an evil Bunny on your leg. You know how I call it? Luci. - Luci Bunny? GÃ­>f Come on Jos. Get up. Come on. Don't get up tight. Come on. You never fucking listen. You never fucking listen. See, this is what happens man. This is what happens when you don't listen to ppme and you go off on your own. You know how's it gonna be like kid? I'm gonna be standing on your grave side with my cap in my hand. That's what's gonna happen. It'll help man. You're fucked. Where's your clothes? Where's your backpack? PpWhere's your shit? Hush, little Josi don't say a word, Luci's gonna bring you a buzz full of birds. Here you are. Sad bastard. Sad fucking bastard. If those birds don't suck your dick, Luci's gonna give you another trick. You're dying. Wake up. You gotta get your life together boy. Come on. Wake up! - Here's your coffee. - Thanks. Hey, you wanna light them candles? You may need them. - So where's Luci now? - I don't know. Yeah, I can see that. So, you're at the end of your taller, ha? What do you have to say for yourself? Look at the state of you. Is this what you wanted? W>Rj JrRÃ­RgÃ­frWFw That's your fucking bed. Have a fucking shower, ppyou need to shave as well. It's not much, but it's my fucking home. But you're not here forever. You gotta get your act together. This is it, this is your wake up call. - Hello! Do you hear me? - Yeah. So, what's happened. What's going on now? - I... - Sorry? - I fucked up. - Don't we all? You're not your own. I just don't know what to do. Well, I'm not gonna tell you what to do. That's not what I'm here for. Normally I walk by bums like you in the street. I don't know. Maybe I see a little bit of me in you as well. But I tell you, I'm not happy. What was these deviations you've been taking? PpAll these little... What was that all about? All these journeys you were going. What are you avoiding? So, this is why the chick doesn't want you, yeah? Because you're not good at communicating. No, don't fucking start crying on me now. PpFur fuck's sake! - You wouldn't understand. - Tell me. Try me. - You wouldn't. - I don't fucking know man but I've had my shit. Hey, when you have an ear to listen, continue. I told everyone my dad was death. But actually he's not. So what, you got shit with your dad? But that doesn't mean that you're gonna be shit. Doesn't mean your kid's gonna have shit from you. You're not gonna do the same thing, you're gonna start a different plan. - I'm afraid that I will. - But everybody is a-fucking-fraid. There's nothing wrong with that. The problem is with some fucking people ppis that they go in without fear. And they fuck up. It's good to have fear. It means you're thinking. The thing is that my Dad was a Pedophile. And I cannot have kids. So you think it carries on? - Too much for me man. - Too much for me. Ok, let's change the subject. Shave. You make a clean start and we start with shaving. Everybody needs a fresh start. We start now. We take it from now on and we see how it goes. Alright? No promises. With this Luci character, you know what I mean? PpI love him, he's a good guy but he only has the answers for himself. He doesn't have the answers for you, nobody does. Only you have the fucking answers man. And this thing with your father, I think you're in the wrong lane, I think you're thinking wrong. PpI think it's wrong. I don't think so man, I don't think this is ppa good way to be thinking. Alright, you want more coffee? Let's go, we'll get it sorted.
