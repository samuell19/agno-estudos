Maybe if we… bend the knees and… put the body in the foetal position? You're okay to drive? It's 8 hours to Calcutta. Yeah I'm okay. You got the papers, right? Yup. You guys make it fast! I'm waiting in the car, okay? That's really rude. - Come in and at least say Hi. - Mama, I need to pee. - Will the loo be clean Bonnie? - I don't think so. Come on Shutu. Will it be Indian style? Come on, hurry up! Mrs. Curney! Are you open? Oh yes! Please come in. I've been waiting for you'll to arrive. Nandu! You'll are finally here. Hello my girl! How are you? - She's very sleepy. - Oh I see! Is there a bathroom we can use? - Of course, yes. Come. - Thank you. Come on. Hi. Why don't you'll go ahead and take a look at the bakery till then? Come, this way. Don't mind dear, it's a bit of a mess in here. No, not at all. No problem. Where's the light? Right here. Thank you. Your mother mentioned you'll were coming in today. So you know what I've done? I've kept a loaf aside for you. Oh! Curney's special loaf! Yes. Usually you know, it gets sold out very quickly. What with it being the holiday season and all… Have you met my cousin, Shutu? Er no, no… - Shyamal. Hello. - Hello. Well he doesn't come around here much. When was the last time you came here? Baba, even I want cake! No no, no cake. - Go and sit with Mama in the car. - No, I want one cake! Why don't you take this? It's a nice fruitcake. She'll love it! Yeah. Okay. That will be 9 rupees and 4 annas please. Hey Maniya! How've you been? I'm doing fine! I hope you've got the hooch ready! - It's all taken care of! - Oh very good! Hi Maniya! You remember Maniya? From last time? Manjari, where are you? Come quick. They're here! - Hi! - Hey Shutu! Open the boot for Maniya. - How are you Baba? - I'm fine. Granny! Come here my darling! How's my sweetie pie? Very tired. I'm sure you didn't get to leave at 5. - This Mimi delayed us. She's always late. - Where's Tania Bakshi? Tania Bakshi! - Hi Aunty! I have to rush to the loo. - Go go! - Uncle, how are you doing? - Very well. Shutu! How are you doing? All well? I'm fine. Exams over? Yes, over Aunty. I hope they went well? Yes, yes of course! Okay. - How's your mother doing? - Fine. And you? Tani, you are in Class 1, right? I'm in Class 3, grandpa! - Oh really? - Baba, seriously? Where should I keep this? Here inside… Why hasn't the fire been lit yet? It's so cold. Look at these city people! Wait till you see how cold it gets in January. Maniya, listen! Yes? Bring the wood in. - Let's get the fire going. - Okay. Shutu, you didn't lock the car? The headlights are still on. Go and lock it! What are you doing? This is Bihar! Tani, get out of those filthy clothes. No, I want to jump for some time. Here. These are for your room. - My darling, have you eaten? - Yes. Ma, the stuff you'd asked for is there. You got it? Thank God! Can't get anything in this godforsaken place! Will you have some tea? No. We'll have dinner soon, right? Okay. Oh and we have some Christmas Cake! Curney insisted that we take it! Oh! That Curney… One penny for weak tea, half a penny for the crumbs! Ma! You don't teach her these things! I don't know when these lights are going to come back on. - Ma, do you want a drink? - Yes please, son. Baba, how is your knee these days? Better? Nothing gets better at this age. Face it Ma, sooner or later, the two of you will have to move back to Cal. You've started already! Why do you crib all the time? Dr. Goswami is here every other day. That he is. And every time he is here, he polishes off all the brandy by himself. So what? He doesn't charge for the treatment either. - What treatment, OP! - Okay that's enough! You can drink with Dr. Goswami all you want… But if one of you had to go the hospital you'd need Vikram to drive you there. As if Vikram is going to be any less drunk! It's the groom himself! How the hell are you, you bastard? Where the hell is your carriage? Carriage? This guy was gifted a chariot for his dowry. What shit! Gifted? I was robbed! - What happened to Stella? - Stella got a sibling, I told you! - You never listen to anything. - Nandu! Brian! So good to see you man! Hey, when did you get those glasses man? You look like an uncle! - Fucker! - Hey where are Uncle and Aunty? What the fuck is that? You wait till Aunty sees this. You're always buttering her up! Hey, you can also use Stella while you're here. Nice! Hello! How're you doing big guy? What's that on your shawl? Here's my drinking buddy! - Hello Uncle! - How are you son? What is this? Tan-ta-da! Oh my! We should be giving you presents. Besides, we don't have any cassettes. He'll get us cassettes as well now, won't he? Of course! I'll get the cassettes also Aunty, don't worry. I got two of these for my wedding. I thought I should get one here. After all, this is my second home! What second home? You only come here when Nandu comes. He's a very busy man… And why didn't you bring your bride? When do we get to see her? No Aunty, I just dropped in on my way back from work. She must be still recovering from the wedding! We missed you guys. Why didn't you come? Yeah, we really missed all of you! You should've all come. Me and Bonnie really wanted to make it but couldn't get leave. But this week we must do dinner at home. Yes? Yeah, okay. Tell me when you are free? Tomorrow? Day after? Oh 31st! Baba, 31st? Good idea! New year will be celebrated in this house. Am I right? I'm always free! You ask this guy. He's the dark horse, this bugger. What? You ask him about his big news! - Hey Vikram, man… - What big news? - Tell them! - Bugger, you're also getting married? Where are the girls? Tell me, what is it? I think I finally got a job! Wow! Well done! Fee Fi Fo Fum. I smell the blood of an English ma'am. Come on give me that cheek! Give me that! Look what I found! - Thank you! - Vikram! Hey! Bonnie! Where's your wife? Outside? No, I couldn't get her along. Don't worry you'll meet her soon enough. - They are planning some dinner outside. - Great. We must! Where's Mimi? She's inside. Baba's office. Need any help? Mr. Vikramjit Chaudhary! Congratulations! How was your honeymoon? It's back! The lights are back Manjari! Please serve the dinner. - Australia! That's so far. - I know. So you're taking Aunty with you? Let's see once I get there. I'm so glad you're getting out of this place. When's your joining date? End Feb, I think. - Feb is just around the corner. - Congratulations Brian! - Thanks! - Shutu… Isn't this your father's sweater? - So soon you're leaving then? - Ah! Dinner. Where were you guys? Come guys, get a plate. Come sit, sit. This smells so good! Brian, what's the capital of Australia? - Isn't it Melbourne? - Vikram, salad? I eat only meat. So our country bumpkin is going all the way to Australia! Can you pass me the fork please, Vikram? I don't give a fork. I think it is Canberra. Where's the family tree? It's up ahead somewhere. Bonnie... Nandu, O.P, Anupama, Mimi, and Tani. Tani! Come and have a bath. Not now Ma! Okay, I'm going in. But you come inside in 5 minutes. Okay? Where's your name Shutu? It's not there? No! - What is it? - It's a frog! - What happened? - A frog! - It's a big one. - What happened? Nothing Ma. It's a damn frog. Of course there'll be frogs here! - Manjari! - What happened Ma? What happened Bonnie? Manjari! Why are you standing there, staring? Go and get a broom! - Haven't I told you about the drain? - I see it! I see it! It's over there. It's gone behind the commode. I just... Bonnie, it's just a small frog! - Calm down. We'll get it out. - Why is it looking at me? Shutu... - Be careful. - Ma, shut the door. Manjari! Don't kill him inside. Shutu! - Hi. - Hi. I'm bored. Why? What happened? I don't like it over here. Why? It's so beautiful here Tani! No, there are so many insects, there's no TV... and there's no cement. What? No cement? Yeah. Okay. Where's Bonnie? Sleeping. Baba? Sleeping. - And you don't want to sleep? - No. What were you doing? I was just trying to draw a frog here. Oh yeah? Show. See. I like this one. - This one? - Yeah. I think he looks just like you. No, he looks like you. No see. He looks like you. His face is just like yours. No, he looks like you because it's a boy. Okay. Tani, see what I found. - Butterfly? - No, it's a moth. Try touching it? Gently, hold it. I'm leaving it. Okay? I'm leaving it. Okay, give it back. Let's put her back safely, okay? What's this? These are my 'E' words. Words I like that start with the letter 'E'. Show me! E-yo-logy Eulogy. Es-ten-tic? Esoteric. - Esoteric? - Esoteric. Ec-lec-tic Nice Tani! Eclectic. You know what it means? - Yeah. - What? Chocolate, chocolate and chocolate! - Come. - Mama, please don't go. - Go back to sleep. - Please don't go. Come on Tani! You're 8 years old, a big girl. No, I'm not a big girl. - But you're so brave at home! - No. What are you scared of? That window. I'm telling you it was a table like this. It went up in the air, almost this high! What balls! How do you know someone wasn't lifting it with their knees? No, no. Even I was there! No one was lifting it for Christ's sake... Who? Who? What happened? So you're saying that your neighbor... Uncle Harris, re- established contact with the living world as a wooden table? Well, Mrs. Harris continues to believe that till the day. In fact, just the other day she invited me to have tea with "them". You're serious? She and her dead husband? Hey don't laugh yeah... - It happens, okay? - Yeah. Sometimes spirits inhabit people or objects and then they just never leave. Buggers! But why would they come back at all? Unfinished business. Okay, now we need to start. Come on Nandu! That depends on whom we are calling. I'm not doing a planchet just for anyone. Should we call Elvis? - "You ain't nothing but a hound dog!" - One second. Are we even sure he's really dead? What? You think he's hiding? Yeah. Under Mrs.Harris' table... Hey come on guys! Let's call somebody closer home. *****! - *****! - Okay done. ***** really needs to have a chat with his daughter... Okay, okay... So who's going to be the medium? Not me. Umm... Young blood! - Young blood! - We need young blood! - Young blood! - Perfect! - Come on Shutu! - No, No... I don't want to take part in all this anyway. What? Why? Shutu. Why? No Bonnie! But why not? Because I... I think that it causes them a lot of pain or something. How can they feel pain? I mean they're dead! No, you guys please carry on. I'm very sleepy anyway. Sleepy or scared? No, no, nothing like that. Shutu, grow up. Come sit with us. Hey no, now we'll have to make a chart and all. Let's forget it! No, no, no need to make a chart. - Come here. Come, everybody come closer. - Should we clear up this table? Move all this. Hold hands. Listen, let's take this seriously, okay? Sir *****, are you here? Bastards! Concentrate. Seriously, seriously. Sir... Maniya! Damn Maniya! - He scared the shit out of me man. - What's wrong with you? Should I lock the gate before I go? Leave the keys here. I'll do it later. Hey Maniya, get us a candle, will you? A candle? If we're doing it, we might as well do it right. I'm with you actually Shutu on this one. Why? Have a drink! - No, I don't want. Save it for Nandu. - Shut up and drink up! - No I can't drink anymore. - Okay come on guys. - One second. - Shutu! Come! I'm not like this Mimi... Excuse me? She's a full fish. She's a fish! She's a fush! What's a fush? - Big drunk fish! - Just because I'm a Pisces. I drink. What's the problem? Hey! What are you guys doing? Switch off the lights Maniya. Have they gone to bed? Far from it! They're drinking spirits... and calling spirits too! Anybody here? Any spirit passing by? Hey... Ask if any good spirit is passing by. Good spirits don't come so easily. Any spirits, good or evil, passing by? Please communicate with us. Bugger, you made that noise! No, no. I didn't do anything. Somebody made that sound right? That sound didn't even come from here. Yeah, the sound came from that side. Okay. Let's just try again. Okay. Concentrate now. And don't break the circle. The spirit can get trapped here. Sorry. Close your eyes. Any spirit passing by please communicate with us. Okay. Someone's come, someone's come. They're trying to communicate, right? Shh... Quiet. Is a spirit present? Is that a YES? Were you a man? Is that a NO? Were you a woman? Did you die of natural causes? How did you die? That's not a yes or no question! Okay. You're right. Were you killed? Did you kill yourself? Who in this room is going to die first? Is it going to be Brian? Is it going to be Mimi? Is it going to be me? Nandu? Bonnie? Shutu? Shutu? Did you see his face? He completely shat his pants! Shutu... Stop it! I'm coming for you! Hey! What are you doing? - Tani will wake up! - Fucker that's my room. Oh look at the seven sisters! Enough you've scared him! Hey that's the Maadol (drum) sound. Maniya and all are awake! Let's go have some of their hooch! Hooch yeah! Ahh last one. Vikram, please! What will you eat tonight? Would you like some fish bones with the juice of a chameleon? Here comes the young bride... Oh young bride, where will you sleep tonight? Where will you sleep tonight? Beware, a ghost lurks in the mulberry tree. Where will you sleep tonight? Here comes the young bride... A spirit dances on the mulberry tree, Prancing about with ghostly glee. Baba... I'm glad you've finally hung this up. What? It belongs in a museum. Good for nothing. What rubbish! What do you mean good for nothing? All it needs is a little cleaning. Then you'll see... - Okay, let me clean it for you then. - No, please! There's no need for that. I'll do it myself. But what are you going to do with it? Kill chickens? I'll break your legs first. Vikram and his boys go hunting quite often. Hunt for wild boar and all. Yeah, wild boar. Vikram, right! Madam, are you done sprucing yourself up? We've been invited for lunch, not dinner. Yes, yes! I'm coming! You think anyone's going to be looking at you besides me? Bonnie hurry up! - Come Shutu let's go. - Aren't you going to shave Shutu? Some of us believe in having a bath, you know? Even in winter? Huh? You're looking nice. What? You're looking nice! Kitty, we'll serve the Mulligatawny first. And I need one more soup spoon please. What do you want me to put the chicken in? I've taken out the casserole. It's on the dooley, Kitty! Brian Uncle, what are their names? They don't have names. We're giving them away. All of them? Yeah except this one. He hasn't found a home yet, so I guess he'll stay here with us. Unless... you want to keep him? Wow, can I? Yeah! Nice view, huh? Yeah. It's nice. So when do we get to meet the missus? Who Purnima? Yeah. I'll get her along next time. You should have brought her along today. It's such a beautiful day. Hey! Come for lunch! I'm hungry. Hey guys, come on. Lunch is ready. Let's go! Please start, please. Come on. Hurry up! The soup will get cold and all! Come, let's go eat. - Looks amazing Mrs.Mckenzie! - Hi Uncle! - The stream is full of fish. - Oh cutlets! Hey Shutu! Just get my shawl please! It's on that chair. Brian Uncle said I could keep him. You're not having a drink? - What happened? - Puppy! - Why only one? - I'm very disciplined in the day. I want a puppy Ma. Ma, please! I'll give you some chicken and rice? No Ma, I want a puppy. Ma, I'll take care of him and do everything. Shutu, you'll help me right? Yes, I'll help you. Now you don't start! Come on Bonnie, it's just a small puppy. Please. I really want a puppy. Okay, maybe. We'll see later. Tani I haven't said yes! Come back. Baba? Baba let's go home! What're you reading? Gulliver's Travels. I'm just re-reading this. You should have studied Literature. You're what? An undergraduate, right? And I'll be applying for a Ph.D. as well soon. You were always a first class student, right? Weren't you planning to go abroad or something? Yeah. I'll be applying for a scholarship as well. In England. Does that leave you much time for a girlfriend? Come on! A handsome boy like you. Shutu! Get me some more custard please. - It's finished over here. - Yeah! Yes. I'll be right back. Run along then! Hey Shutu! A spirit dances on the mulberry tree, Prancing about with ghostly glee. Let's go home Tani. Why? Okay. Let's go home. Baba! Let's go home? They're all still saying bye. Move. Let's turn the car round. Unless you want to drive us home? Very funny! What about Shutu? Yeah! No, no please, Nandu. Why? No, I... I haven't had any practice in a long time. Come on. It's just a short distance. Come on! Come on, Shutu! Okay. Now we'll take it a little ahead, and then we'll reverse it out. Okay? Shutu. Come on! Good, good. Gentle on the clutch. Yes. To the left. To the... Okay. Relax, okay? Start the car again. Yeah. Okay. Check the rear-view mirror. Check the rear-view mirror! Done? - Yes. - Put the car in reverse. - Is it in reverse? - Yes. Now look in the rear-view mirror and back the car. Come on. It's not in reverse. Do it again. Push it down. Hard. Push it hard! Back and down! 10 and 2. 10 and 2, Shutu! Hand position 10 and 2! Be glad my dad isn't teaching you. You know what he did when I made a mistake? Baba! Relax Tani. That's how you learn. Now look in the rear-view mirror and reverse the car. Gently, and turn left. Yeah, left, left. Turn left. Left, left... Now to the right. Right, right... Shutu right! Shutu right! Damn it Shutu! Get out of the car. I hope this one has better luck than your previous pets. Please! Chico is very happy in doggy heaven, thank you! Of course! Along with Wolfie, Sheeba and what was the name of that tortoise? Haridas. They're keeping each other company. - Isn't it, Tani? - Yeah. Poor fellow... He still must be wandering around somewhere. Why? What happened to Haridas? Nothing. He just went out for a walk and never came back! Yeah, because we all forgot to bring him back! You forgot to bring him back? Don't worry darling, he's alive. Tortoises live till they are a 100 years old. He'll come back one day. Come back? I'm sure the villagers have eaten him by now! Never mind! Listen, what are we going call this one now? Fluffy! Fluffy? And who's going to look after Fluffy when we all go back? I don't know. Shutu? He's hardly ever in the hostel. He's always at home. Oh no Mama, he's peed on me! This is why I'd said don't get him on the bed! Oh naughty boy. You naughty little boy! Come on, get up now! Who is going to stay with you now? I have to go work now... Check. At least your chess is better than your driving. What happened Baba? Can't sleep? What are you looking for? I was looking for... Let it be now. We'll look for it in the morning. Why don't you play your game? Do you need something? Baba, please go to sleep. Am I your father or are you mine? We'll see about that in the morning. You go to bed now. You play your game! Fucker, what are you doing man? You'll wake everyone up! Come on! Let's take her out for a spin! Are you mad? It's freezing! - What, it's freezing? - Freezing! Stella's nice and warm for you! - Oh Stella! - Oh I've got something else for you. Just take it out. What's this? Have a sip! Just have a sip man! Nice, eh? What? What the hell! You can't even drink anymore Nandu! You're growing old in front of my eyes. This is really sad yeah. Really sad! Fucker hold this. You just wait here. - I'll get my jacket, you just wait here! - That's the man! Hey come here! Open this for me. See how she purrs for me? Yeah. You've ever ridden one? Yes. - Yeah, right. Hey don't touch! - Vikram and Stella! No touching Stella. Okay? Why? You never minded me touching her. You're different Mimi. You can touch anything you like. Can I? But don't start right now, okay? There's a kid standing right here. Behave yourself. Hey Mimi... get off. Get off yeah! Fucker move! Your chariot awaits you. Hey! Give me that. Shutu! Lock the doors, I have the keys. Hold on tight Vikram! Who was winning? Me. You're so pretty. You could be a girl. Come let's go outside and see. What are you guys saying? There's so much space. We'll draw one line there, then there's one, two, three, four… Brian I'm telling you there aren't enough people for Kabaddi. Hey Shutu! You'll also play right? Yeah right. Then let's ask Tani also to play. Maniya, you know how to play Kabaddi? Yes I do! But what about this wood… Forget the wood. Get Manjari too. She doesn't know how to play. Of course I do! Everybody knows how to play Kabaddi here! Okay, so who will be the captains? Vikram and Brian? Yeah, Brian and I. Okay, I choose Nandu. Hey no wait, we'll toss a coin. Okay, toss a coin. Who has a coin? I have one. Come on. Heads. Hey don't touch it! Don't touch it! Yeah! Nandu! Come on Maniya, you're in my team. Okay. Mimi, baby, come here, come here. Bonnie. Thank you! You weaklings. Weaklings! So that leaves what? This one and that one, right? I choose Manjari. Shutu, come here. What're you going to play from the tub or what? Come quickly. Who's drawing the line? Here's the line. Come on! Go get them tiger! Brian, Brian. Go for Brian! Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi… Get Bonnie! Stop it! Are you nervous? Don't be. Shutu! - Yeah. - Okay. Come on Shutu. Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi… Here comes the weakling. Come on let's get him. Manjari this side. Shutu, get Nandu. Hey you! You don't distract me, okay? My dear sister, I hope you all are fine. I've not been doing so well myself. I've been very worried about Shutu. I met a friend of his last week. He told me that their results were out… and that Shutu had failed. I can't even imagine… how a brilliant student like Shutu could have failed. Maybe it was a mistake to send him to Calcutta for higher studies. I feel very alone now that Shutu's father has gone. I think of you often. I'm coming. Are you guys ready for this? Yeah we're ready. So scared! Come on! Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi… - Hey! Hey! - You took a breath! I saw it. What? What are you talking about? What breath? I didn't take any breath. I don't know. I didn't see anything. I saw him taking a breath. I saw you put your hand. I've been saying Kabaddi non-stop. What are you talking about? You covered your mouth… I kept saying kabbadi. You're out Brian! You're out! You're out. - This is cheating. - Manjari! Hey you're cheating… Don't worry Manjari. Just follow me. Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi… Vikram you're losing your touch! Come on Vikram! - Don't let him touch the line. - You touch the line. Okay, okay. Vikram stop it! Hey that's enough. That's enough. Guys do something. Go fucking stop him. Guys! Tani! What's going on? Maniya, what are you doing here? Get back to work! - And oh my God, Shutu! - Are you okay? Oh my God, he's bleeding. Let's take him inside. I got a letter from your mother today. Go to the post office and give her a call tomorrow. Why? Hold still… Let me see. Where did Vikram and Brian go? They had to leave. They didn't want to have lunch? No. Shutu… What happened to your eye? You know they were playing Kabaddi and… Kabaddi? Kabaddi! No wonder! You know how it is. Boys will be boys. - She's sleeping? - Hmm. Vikram is one hot headed guy. Well, he's always been like that. Yeah but he needs to pick on people his size. Not a kid like Shutu. Come on. 23 is not a kid! We got married at that age. Yeah, but Vikram behaves like he's 23! And always gets away with it. Well, I suppose he does get a little carried away. Even the other day during the planchet, you guys took it too far. It was quite cruel. What do you mean? You were also a part of it. Yeah, but I didn't know what you guys were going to do. You know how sensitive Shutu is. How he's been wearing his dad's sweater everyday. Oh come on! If he'd lost his father when he was 8 or 9 I can understand. But he's grown man. It's not been that long. Just give him some time. You know what he needs to do? He needs to toughen up. And he needs to take care of his mother. Enough now. I don't want to talk about this. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Here! But I just… Shutu? Shutu? What happened? Shutu? It's okay. It's me, your brother. It's okay. Come. Come. It's okay. Come. Let's go. This way. Come on faster. More fast! Sir. Yes? Can you please call this number? - For which place? - Bardhaman. How much more time? Wait Tani. Call connected to Bardhaman. Hello? Hey! Bardhaman? Come Tani. Ma, where are you? We are home! - Hi baby. - Hi! - How was the market? - Very good. - Come here. What's this? - Stick. I'm a musketeer! Put this down and wash your hands Tani. Did you call your mother? The line did not connect. Maybe the phone isn't working. Try again tomorrow. The mutton's here? Ma, should we start with the mutton? Yeah. I think so. - You know where everything is right? - Yeah. I'm going for my bath. Manjari! Bring me the water. When are these people going to leave? I'm sick and tired of all this work. So who's this slut Vikram has married? Isn't she much younger than him? Yeah. Ma was saying she's from some small town. You know how they are... Get their girls married off really young. What's her name? Pratima. - What? - No, no, Purnima. Khasi? I don't know. But somewhere from there only. You saw the new jeep? Yeah! For them Vikram is royalty. Royalty, please! What time are they coming tonight? 7, 7:30. Okay, just give me the tomatoes. I haven't cut the tomatoes. I'm still on the potatoes. Why have you cut it so small? It's going to get... melt in the gravy. But you didn't say! We can always fry it separately and add it in the end. Yeah, but it's not going to absorb any flavor. Leave it! Cut the tomatoes. I'll take it. I'll take it. How do you want it? Well, ideally I'd like it pureed. Well I can't puree it for you here. Just cut it fine. Hurry up! It's dead, right? I guess. What shall we do now? Shall I say a poem? Yeah. When I was one, I had just begun. When I was two, I was nearly new. When I was three, I was hardly me. When I was four, I was not much more. When I was five, I was just alive. But now I am six... I'm as clever as clever. So I think I'll be six now and forever. Beautiful Tani! Thank you. A river of desires flows through my heart, Pure as the light of the sun. I pause to look at my shy reflection, Full of hope for what is to come. Someone special smiles at me. It seems my dreams are coming true. With you in my life now. A river of desires flows through my heart, Pure as the light of the sun. - Wow! - Very nice! Thank you. We had no idea you could sing so well! Oh Vikram, why have you been hiding her for so many days? Seriously. Poonam, sing one more please! Yes please. - Come on! - Sing that one... No, thank you. Someone else should sing now. Yeah. Let's have a faster song. One we can dance to at least. I know! Dhitang Dhitang Bole! Tara rum pum pum Beats the tribal drum With tumultous joy Moonlight fills the sky! Come running one & all To this earthly dance hall Come along Shutu! Come, oh come, aye The best hour passes by Clouds come rolling nigh At the edge of the moonlit sky! Guys, wait! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Bonnie! The food is getting cold! I think I twisted my ankle. Look how she is behaving. Ma she's just talking. With her saree falling off? No wonder that boy didn't marry her. She can't help it if men are attracted to her. Doesn't she just love the attention? Just like her mother. These foreigners... Ma! I just love this Bengali mutton curry! It's all in the potatoes. They absorb all the flavour. - Oh is it? - Bonnie made it, you know? - Actually, Mimi and I made it together. - Please! I was just following orders. Hey! What happened there? You know they were fighting? - Oh Really? - No no. Nothing like that. Show me! It looks like a bad wound. It's nothing. We were just playing a game... You should use a hot compress on it. Really helps. Such pretty anklets you're wearing Purnima. Haven't seen many anklets made of gold. Isn't it? It belonged to the Nawab's grandmother. Nawab! Wow! You don't get these designs nowadays. They have a tradition of golden anklets in their family. Oh! How interesting. I didn't know that. Obviously, gold was so expensive that only the royalty could afford it. Even the men used to wear jewelry, like earrings for example. I think earrings would really suit you Vikram. Yeah, I think so too. You'll look like a real bandit. Bandit! Ma is just so happy that I finally got her a daughter-in-law... that she is giving away whatever little family jewels are left. It seems you're not taking very good care of your family jewels. Yeah! Wasn't it only yesterday that... you almost lost your manhood, hah? Bugger? I'm really sorry... I know we've just met, but I'm saying it for your sake only. Yeah we're really concerned about the royal heir you see. We don't want the family to go into any further decline. Yeah, after all we can't let anything happen to the Nawab's kebabs right? What Vikram really needs is a chastity belt. That way Purnima can relax when he's away. No no. It's to also protect the family jewels. That's perfect! A golden chastity belt for the Nawab! Cheers to that! Yes! Cheers to my kebabs! Cheers! Ma, you'd said you'll come with me, right? Tani, what are you doing? I'm working. Where should I keep this? - You're done already? - Yes, yes. But you hardly ate anything. Give it to me. Tani. Come let's go inside. Go with Shutu, Tani. Didn't you find a towel in the bathroom? Sorry, sorry. Hey Nandu, come let's smoke. Are you sure you don't need any help? - Yeah. I'll ask Mimi to help me. - Okay. - Mimi? - Yes, Bonnie? Come? Just what do you think you're doing? Why? What happened? Can you be a little more dignified? Excuse me? He's a married man now. Exactly. So tell him. He's the one that's married. How many drinks have you had? Have you had dinner? I'm fine, okay? You don't need to worry about me. Bonnie! Coming. Okay, okay. Get ready everybody! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Hey Shutu! Come here! Come here son. Happy New Year! 1979! Happy New Year. Happy New Year Shutu! Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And days o'lang syne! We'll drink a cup of kindness yet, For auld lang syne! Party's over? Yeah. Do you want me to get you some water? Can you get me another drink instead? Sure. You were having rum, right? I think I might have twisted my ankle. See? It's swollen. Yeah I know. - I'll just try and move it once? - Okay. Sorry! Sorry! It's okay Shutu. You can touch it. You have really beautiful feet. But I don't have any golden anklets, right? I better go to bed. You'll take my shoes? Okay. God! Come. I might've had a little... A little bit too much to drink. Come on Captain, take a wicket already! Okay, 20 across. Actress in a best-selling swimsuit poster. - Tani, Happy New Year. - Happy New Year! Happy New Year, everybody. Happy New Year. Good afternoon Mimi! Slept well? Not really. Really? It's only 12 o'clock in the afternoon. Do you want to sleep a bit more? Uh... Sophia Loren. No that's too long. Shutu? Match? Bo Derek. Match? Okay Shutu! You'll know this one! The high pitch of a loud siren drops as it moves past its observer. This is called the dash effect. Doppler. Yes! Out! Shutu! Shutu! Hi! Hi Tani. What are you doing? Where are we going? You know how to drive a motorcycle? Yeah. I know how to ride a motorcycle. But you don't know how to drive a car! Yeah. Okay. I'll sit ahead and you'll sit behind me, because Baba said if I sit behind I'll fall off. Tani... I can't ride as well as your Baba, okay? I'm also just practicing at the moment. So when I learn properly then you sit with me in the front. Baba allowed you? Yeah, yeah. Really? Yeah! Tani where's Fluffy? I don't know. He must be inside. What do you mean you don't know? You must know where he is. I don't know... Tani, what if he runs out of the house again? Bonnie will get really angry with you. Go! Go! Look for him. But you wait for me. Don't go without me, okay? Okay, okay. You go. And be careful! Hi! Fluffy! Fluffy! Shutu see I found him! He was under your bed. Shutu? Shutu! Shutu! Shutu! - Mimi! - Hmm? Why have we come here? Why not? Hey, isn't that Curney? Mrs. Curney! Is she ignoring us? "Elizabeth Curney. 1950 to 1956." "Those that God loves do not live long." Only 6 years old. So sad... What's this? You like sponge cake, Shutu? Yeah. Want? - No! - Why? Mimi how can you eat it? It's been lying there. She just left it. You're always so proper Shutu. It's very boring. But... It's not meant for us. Oh! Who is it meant for? Elizabeth Curney? Maybe. Come on. Have it for me. - No Mimi, I cannot. - For Mimi. Come on! Yes you can! Mmm... it's delicious. Admit it. What if she comes back Mimi? "What if she comes back Mimi?" Mimi! Mimi! Mimi? I'm the ghost of Elizabeth Curney! I suck cock in hell. Ma'am, your clothes. Manjari, keep them outside. This one? Yes this one. Look at its state. Go clean it! Come on, hurry up. Let's get back before it gets dark. Manjari? Yes? Have you seen Tani? I think she was playing with the puppy in the verandah. Uff, that pup! Okay, listen... make a glass of hot chocolate for Tani please. Okay. Can you people work any slower? Step on it now! Nonsense! Smith & Wesson uncle .32. It's a snubnose. Should I get it for target practice tomorrow? Why not? But know this for sure... It won't have a range beyond 10 metres. His range might be only 10 metres, But yours doesn't look like it'll fire at all! Vikram, I'm glad you're here. These labourers are driving me crazy. They always come late. If they come at all. They are all the same Aunty. I'll speak to the contractor. - Hi! - Hi! How are you? Good, good. Come, sit. This is the tea Purnima got for us last night. Oh! She's given it to you guys too. Hey isn't that Brian? Manjari, one more cup please. And call everyone else. Hey! You guys wanna keep this bugger or not? I keep finding him back home. He keeps running back to his mother. I thought Tani was playing with Fluffy. She's not with you? No, I found him in garden. - Here, Brian. - Thanks Aunty. There's no one else at home. What do you mean? There's no one. - Tani? - She must be with Shutu! - Maniya! - Yes? Have you seen Shutu and Tani? No. Just go and ask them. Hey listen! Did you see anyone leave? Someone left on a motorcycle earlier. He says someone left on a motorcycle. On a motorcycle? - Who went out on a motorcycle? - I'll check. Did he see Tani as well? You think Mimi's also gone with them? God knows. Nandu! They're here. Shutu? - Where were you guys? - Tani is not with you? No. You didn't take her with you? - No. - Wait, what happened? Hey Vikram! Vikram, she's not in the house man. What happened? Where's Tani? Did you check the whole house? Of course we checked the whole fucking house. I can't believe you guys went off with my bike like that? I wanted to ride your bike Vikram! You should have told us if you two wanted to go out. Okay did you see her before you left? Where was she? Why didn't you take her with you? No... We... I mean... I didn't want to take her without asking you. Shutu, where was the last time you saw her? Here, in the house. She was playing with Fluffy. Where? Where? Back...at the back. I can't believe you just left her like that. Maniya, go and check near the tub. In the mustard fields somewhere, I've lost my toe ring, in the vast open fields. Won't you come with me mother, to look for my precious ring? Lost in the vast open fields. Tani! What are you doing woman? Just sit there quietly and don't add to the chaos. Hey what happened? Did you find the batteries or not? - This damn thing is not working. - Are these the new ones? Try to think clearly. Where did you see her last? I don't understand. I thought she was with Shutu. He didn't even tell me before leaving. And you're counting on that imbecile and that kid to do your job, right? - My job? - Yes, your job. This is your fault and this is happening because of you! He's been with her every day and you've never had a problem with it! That's not the fucking point Bonnie. You can't find a fucking torch and you're telling me to do my job. Guys, guys! - Stop it Nandu! - It's not my fault! Calm down. - It's your fault. - No, it's not my fault. Calm down. Calm down. - Nandu's right you know Bonnie. - Ma! Yes. Shutu's not been himself. He never used to get into fights. And you know... He's failed his final exam. Failed? Yes. He's been thrown out of the hostel, he's lied to his mother and left her all alone in Bardhaman. And come here for a holiday. Is this responsible behavior? Okay. Guys come on, let's just focus okay? It's clear that she's not in the house. So let's not waste any more time here. The local police chief knows me well. Go mention my name, he'll help you. Okay, but the police will still want answers. Who saw her last? Who saw her last? Manjari. Manjari! Manjari! Coming. What time did you see her last? I don't know. I don't know? Please, Manjari. When I'd come by to keep the clothes... I saw her then. Not after that. Okay. That must be around 4 o'clock, just before you arrived. Listen, it's not been that long Nandu. She's just a little girl. She couldn't have gone far. Not more than a two-kilometer radius. You guys go search the grounds. I'll go get Ganju and Khushia. Come on. - And I'll go check at my house. - I'm coming with you. Vikram? Vikram! - Nandu, I'm coming with you. - No, no... You stay here. Please. I'm going to go mad if I'm just sitting here and waiting. Baby, you stay here with Ma and Baba. If she comes back home she may need her mother, right? Trust me, we'll find her. We'll find her. Shutu, you come with me. Tani! Okay Shutu. I don't think we can go any further. You go look that side. I'll look here. Tani! Tani! Tani! Tani? Tani! Tani! Tani, this is Shutu. Tani can you hear me? Bonnie. Why are you guys worrying so much? Relax. Haridas is not coming back. O.P! You've had too much to drink. Must have been eaten by now... I was going to say it earlier but then I didn't. What? You know that wolf that's been coming around in the night? But we trapped him. Don't think any will be back soon. Tani! Tani! Tani! Shutu! Shutu! Nandu! Shutu, where are you? Come we have to go. I'm here! Shutu, come let's go home! Fuck! Nandu! Nandu, I'm here! Nandu! Tani! Look Baba is here! Come here my baby. Thank God you're okay! You are not to leave the house again! You hear me? - Let it be now. - Stop it. She's home now. Where did you find her? I don't know what made me check the area behind Siyartoli. Yeah and it's really dark and deserted back there. Yeah! And what do I see there? Bahadur is walking with Tani in his arms. Who is this Bahadur now? He works for the Goswamis... He was on his way home and he found her. But the Goswamis are in Calcutta for Christmas. This one had just wandered onto their grounds. Anyway, you found her now. You'll never do this again. Promise me? Promise? Manjari! Serve dinner for everyone. - Will there be enough? - Yes. But Shutu hasn't come back yet. - Shutu isn't back? - No. Send Maniya to look for him. Shutu. Hey Shutu! Shutu! Shutu! Maniya. Maniya! Maniya! Yes? Maniya! Here. - Where? - Here! - Look down. - Shutu! Here! In the ditch. How did you land up here? Everyone's looking for you. Let's go. Vikram sir has found Tani. Come on. Tani. Tani? Tell him to go Ma. It's okay baby. Go to sleep. What are you doing? Just leave my things alone. She's keeps fiddling with my things. Can't find anything when I need it. You still haven't called your mother. It's been three days since I got the letter. Shutu, you better buy your ticket today. But first, go to the post office and call your mother. And then go the station and buy your ticket. See if you can get a confirmed seat. What? But I don't have any money. I'll give it to you. Come on, say something please… We can easily get you a teaching position here in your father's college. How long will you stay away from home? You don't know how I've been managing here alone. You are all that I have now. Shutu, why are you so quiet? Say something please! When's the next train to Howrah? Howrah? Take the train to Gomoh from Chopan station. In Barkhakhana they'll add a bogey for Howrah. Manjari! Got the ticket? Give this to your mother. Leaving? Yeah. Bardhaman? Yeah. But I'll be coming to Calcutta soon. So I'll see you there? Shutu… I really think you should be concentrating on your studies a little more. Nandu! Who's here? Shutu? Please pick up this bottle. If the oil has spilt then wipe it up. Shutu, get that box please. - Maniya! - Yes? Call that Nandu! A bit higher. No, a little lower. Not that much! Okay, keep it aside. Now go and get me a hammer and some nails. See. Never hold the gun in the air like this and fire. It may hurt someone passing by. Open the box. Hand me a bullet. Now put this bullet in… like this… - Hey guys! - Hi! This is how you cock it. Control your breath, then fire it. Uncle… Uncle… Can I hold it once? What? Gun? - Please Uncle. - Some other time. Please Uncle. Before you fire, just once. No son, it's not something to play with. It's a weapon. Please Uncle. I just want to see how it feels. I told you. Some other time. Please. I just want to hold it once Uncle. I just want to hold it once. You just want to hold it? Yes. Hold. Hold. Now leave it. What are you doing? What are you doing? Give the gun back to me. Nandu! Hey Nandu! Shutu, what are you doing? Shutu put the gun down! Take Tani and go inside right now. Bonnie, take Tani and go inside! Shutu! Shutu! Shutu… Shutu, you don't have to do this. Shutu, listen to me. Calm down Shutu. It's okay. I'm sorry… Give me the gun. Just give me the gun…
