Some people say growing up is hard. Okay, that's rubbish. Anyone can grow up. Well, except DJs. The problem is teenhood. That's the time between 13 and 19 where everything's a mess. Just like today, it's the first day at junior college where, until the exam results come out and our places confirmed, the whole school is a mess of different school uniforms. There are the green uniforms, the red uniforms, the uniforms with the fake pin-on tie, uniform with spots, uniform without spots, with sleeves, without sleeves. Kind of makes you wonder what's the point in wearing uniforms in the first place. Yep, that's me. Mui Ee. I hate introductions like this, because I never know what to tell people about myself. So I'll just tell you my name, and you figure out the rest. Anyway, before today, I thought I was handling teenhood pretty okay. But then, that's teenhood. It's like a long bus ride, right? Just when you were getting comfortable, everything comes to a complete stop. I believe this is yours? Yeah. Hi. I'm Tom. Tom... Tom D'Cruz. Sometimes people just make an impression on you. It's not as if they have three eyes and two noses, or something. Thomas Martyn D'Cruz was like that. Not the three eyes and two noses. I mean, the instance of meeting Tom is like walking into a brick wall... and liking it. Every morning this man waits at the gate in order to meet Miss Boon as she comes to school. He is Mr. Robert Mills. Expat teacher. Outspoken. Almost hip. And totally out of place in the Singapore education system. Mr. Mills, could you please move your bike so my fiancé can pass through? Miss Boon. My class tutor. The prettiest and nicest teacher in PJC. Unfortunately for Mr. Mills, she's already engaged. I hear there's a pool going around school on the odds of Mr. Mills actually becoming Miss Boon's boyfriend. No one's betting on Mr. Mills. After you. See that on the right? That's the principal of PJC. Dr. E Sopramaniam, MA, East Anglia, PhD, Calcutta. Dr. E likes writing school rules as a hobby. Here he is with a couple of students he caught crossing the road 27 cm within the "No Crossing Zone." What are your names? Yeo Chung Kai. Tua Pek Kong. Yeo Chung Kai. Tua Pek Kong. The guy on the left is Loo Kok Sean, or Kok Sean as he calls himself. Imagine a guy who oozes charm and intelligence, and has the looks of an underwear model. Now imagine the exact opposite. That's Kok Sean. Both of you, see me immediately after school today. Yeo Chung Kai. Well, the most outstanding thing about Kai is that he's not outstanding at all. He's a nice guy and accepts people at face value. Which I guess is why he's stuck with Sean. And let me just warn you. Traffic accidents can be very dangerous to your health. Because you can die from it. And if you were to die, you will not complete your education. Attention, attention, all students. Welcome to Paya Lebar Junior College. Good morning. This is your vice principal Mr. Ngor. As this is your first day at the new school, your principal Mr. E Soper... Sopra... Your principal Dr. E, MA, East Anglia, PhD, Calcutta, would like to talk to you all. So all students, please proceed your way towards the school hall in an orderly manner, for Dr. E, MA, East Anglia, PhD, Calcutta, to give you all the orientation address. The PJC school motto is "Forward Progress in the United March to Harmony and Personal Hygiene." And what does this mean? It means the formula for success is 50% discipline, 50%... What does that look mean? Is it just a "Hello" look? Or even a "Oh, Hello!" look. Or what if it's a "Hello! I really like you" look? I can't tell from here. Actually, I'm not even sure if he's looking at me, or look at someone else and I just happened to see him. To enforce this rule, I've asked Farmi, our school keeper, to electrify the school gate. Standing with me is my best friend, Sissy Song. Sissy's got everything handled so nicely. Boys, school, parents. If she were older than me, she would probably become a model of who I want to be. But nowadays, I'm just trying to keep up. Stay away from him, Mui. I didn't. You don't have to, I can read your mind. Sean, are you sure that line is going to work or not? Kai, does a one-legged duck swim in circles? Sean, I have no idea what that means. Okay, let's move in. Sean, maybe... Another thing I forgot to tell you about Sissy. She seems to attract boys like nectar attracts bees. Hi, girls. I can't help noticing that you were staring at me, so I thought I'd introduce myself. Hi, I'm Sean. Or in this case, houseflies. Come, Mui, let's go. All hits all day, 987 FM. That was "Falling in Love" by John Klass. All hits all day, 987. Hey, welcome in to the Ego Trip on 987 FM. My name is Glenn Ong. Giving the cool people the hits, and everyone else the fits. Tonight we're going to be talking about first impressions. Now, this seems like a pretty good topic, considering that it's the first day of school and everything. And there's probably a lot of first impressions being made. Let's take our first caller, shall we? 6911987. Hello, Perfect Ten. Hello? Hello? Glenn? Yeah. My name is Juan. Yeah, my problem is that today was my first day at school in JC, right? So I made sure my uniform was, like, nice and neat and everything. But I didn't know it was raining at my place last night, right? So there were puddles of water everywhere. And then just before I reached school, this Mercedes went by and splashed muddy water over my uniform. Anyway, I met my new classmates. They all thought I was a slob and didn't want to sit next to me in class. Well, Juan, I'm telling you. You are wrong. I mean, it's the first day of school and I'm sure you were just feeling insecure. I mean, what gave you the impression that they thought you were a slob and didn't want to sit next to you? Because they said "Juan, you're a slob and we don't want to sit next to you." Okay, then that's a different story altogether. And now moving on to our next caller on 6911987. Hello, Perfect Ten. Hello? Hey, Mui! There's a party on Saturday. Party? Mui, you're in JC now. Your mother must give you more freedom. But I never said... How to make friends if you don't socialize? Yeah, but I finish late, and then... The whole gang will be there, and the guys, Joseph, Yew Meng, Bernard. Okay. But you better stay away from Tom D'Cruz. I think he's going to be there. He's bad news. Yeah, okay. Bye. Bye. What does Sissy know? Tom's nothing like what people say he is. In fact, he's just the opposite. Sweet and cute. In fact he's exactly the kind of wonderful guy, who probably wouldn't be interested in me. Sean, you almost hit that bus just now. Kai, it's not my fault, okay? Did you see the way it came into my lane? But Sean, the bus was parked by the side of the road. You can't tell from where you're sitting. I think you just don't react quickly enough. Kai, I have the reactions of a dolphin, okay? Sean, I have no idea what that means. 987 FM. All hits all day. And here's something interesting that happened today. A teenager attempted to shoplift nine life jackets by stuffing them into her jeans at a local store, but accidentally pulled one of the release cords, making the life jacket start to inflate. Quick reaction from the staff saved the teenage shoplifter from being suffocated in her own inflating jeans. In defense, the teenager said that she had been hearing voices in her head, saying, "Do it! Do it! Do it!" Yes, I'm going to do it! Watch out! Sean, you're on the curb. I'm going to call Sissy. You mean she gave you her number? Connections, man. You know the class list? Class list? How did you get that? She's not even in our class. I told you, connections. It's her, it's her. Hello, is that Sissy Song? Yeah, why? This is your lucky day. I'm the guy you met at the canteen, remember? Loo Kok Sean. Yikes! Dude, don't ever call me back. Go get a life! I love you, too, babe. You work really fast. Now it's your turn. Call your Mui Ee. Okay. I'll do it. Just not now. Who was that, Sissy? Some idiot who got my number. Don't worry about it. Tonight we're going to party, right? Kai, do you know we're on the curb? Sissy, I don't know how you can be so enthusiastic about a party and still get to it two hours late. Two hours and twelve minutes, Mui. Timing is everything. Hi, Juan. How are you? No one's here yet? This is my friend Mui. -Please say hi. -Welcome back to 987 FM. You're on the Ego Trip, and my name is Glenn. If you've just tuned in, we're on the topic of parties. And with me for the very first time this evening, Agony Uncle Dr. Adam Wong. Now, Dr. Wong, we've got an email here from Hui Ni asking, "What food should I serve at a party?" Well, Hui Ni, you don't have to bother about that question, because thanks to my thorough research of teen culture, I can tell you that teenage parties are not about food. In fact, everyone stays away from the food, and you can hardly see anyone holding so much as a fork. Really? So what do they do? Teen parties are all about disco dancing. Glenn, why, for a DJ, you're not as hip as me? Teenagers love to disco dance. Disco dancing. How about making new friends, then? No, no. No food, no socializing, no sitting down. Everyone is too absorbed with disco dancing. Especially when that groovy new disco song by ABBA is played. -I see. -You look a bit worried, Glenn. Don't worry. Even if you can't dance, the most important thing is to make sure you get noticed. Sean, do you think that I'm ugly? Yeah, but that's not the point. Then what? You see, beautiful girls would go out with beautiful guys. But beautiful girls will not marry good-looking guys because the good-looking guys only want to go out with beautiful girls. And that makes beautiful girls insecure. So eventually, they'll marry someone who's boring and ordinary. Like you! So you see, my friend, every girl, whether they're pretty or ugly, only want emotional security. Okay. But... what do I do now? Well, for now, I will go out with them. And when it's time, I'll pass them to you. What am I doing here? Even if he didn't come to a party with a date, I'm sure he has one by now. Hi! Want a drink? Hi. Yeah, okay. -We met... -...on the bus. -Your files... -...fell all over the bus. -Do you always... -...complete someone else's sentence? -Only when I'm... -...nervous? Yeah. Mui Ee! -Juan and I are going to get some ice. -Yeah, we're out of ice. Actually, Juan, -why don't you go with Tom? -What? I will go with Tom. No, Mui. I don't think that's a very good idea. I don't mind. I'll go with you. Okay. No, no. I'll go, okay? Let's all go. Here, take my car. Mui Ee! You're not my mother. I wish I know how to talk to them. I mean, talking to girls is like-- I know, it's like a delicate art form. You remember that time I came back from England and I started talking with a British accent? No matter what I said, the girls still think I'm a foreigner. You were only there for five days, Sean. I can't help it. You know, I read somewhere about genetics how guys can actually talk better to each other. -Really? -Yeah. Sometimes I think the problem lies with girls. They don't want to communicate properly. But why not? They think it's more romantic. For example, you don't say to a girl, "Your eyes look good." You must say, "Your eyes are like two marbles in a sea of ivory." But how will I know if she even likes ivory? Talk to her! Get to know her! I don't know how to talk to her, that's the whole point. Yeah, you've got a point. Hey, remember that movie that's like a MTV music video about two lovers killing themselves? -Romeo and Juliet? -Right, that's the one. Where he thinks she's dead and he kills himself, and she finds him dead and she kills herself. Bad communication, boy. But chicks love it. This whole girl thing is sometimes so frustrating and confusing. Girls love confusion. It's in their genes. They can't help it. Speaking of genes, you know what's in my jeans for the past ten minutes? No, Sean. I really don't want to know. Ants. And I think I'm sitting on their path. Kai, if you were to see the girl again, what would you say? Who? The girl you like, that Mui something? Mui Ee? Yeah, whatever. I'd say, "Hi. I'm Kai and you're Mui Ee, right?" Again? Again? Say it again. Hi, I'm Kai. You're Mui Ee, right? Now say it! Kai! I'm Mui Ee, you're hi, right? Need help? No, thanks, buddy. There are some things in life you can prepare too much for. You imagine and you rehearse these things in your head over and over. And you build up such a precise image of how it's going to happen. But when it finally happens in a slightly different way, you don't see it coming until it's just too late to react. First kisses are like that. Nothing you've ever imagined prepares you for it. Once in a while you get that kind of a day where things you believed would never happen actually happen. That kind of a day when you get the feeling that finally everything is going to work out right. A day that you will never forget for as long as you live. Attention, shoppers. Welcome to Borders. Please note, in conjunction with the Child Safety Month at Borders, that we're having a special sale for the following books. Safety in the Home, Safety for Kids, The Guide to Safety for Children and 1,000 Ways to Prevent Child Accidents. Also, would the parents of 6-year-old Lew please come to the information counter, as your son has accidentally swallowed one of our staplers. Thank you. "How to tell if you're in love?" Please. Jealous. What? Nothing. Well, thanks for finding some time for your old friend. I don't know where you've been these past few weeks. Well, you know, here and there. Is there anything going on between you two? We're just friends, okay? I mean, look, I want to help you and some people are just not what they seem. There're rumors about him and Maggie, okay? Like, there're no rumors about you. Mui, how long have we known each other? Okay, whatever. Let's go to Starbucks. Since kindergarten, and since that day, haven't I told you everything? Please, okay, don't get so caught up that you can't even tell who your friends are. Look, I'm spending time with you, okay? Can you stop being my mother? All I'm saying is that-- Maybe I don't want to know what you have to say, okay. This is my chance, okay, Sissy? My chance to have a relationship for the first time in my life. And for the first time in your life, you have to be a lamp post. I'm just trying to help. All those times in the past when you used to go out with your boyfriends, dragging me along and making me feel as though I'm transparent. I never do that. You always do that, Sissy, always. I bring you along because I wanted you to have fun as well. Without me, you're just one big bookworm. I'm not anymore. Not anymore? You think you're so hot? You're nothing but ice cream. Cold and cheap. Say whatever you want, okay, Sissy? I don't want to be stuck in an old friendship. I don't want to be your shadow. Then fine, go! Hello, beautiful. Tom, we're still in our school uniform. Come on, let's go. Why are you so late? Sorry, lunch on me? Tom, you idiot. I've been driving around and around for ten minutes. Where have you been? Late again? Every time late. Not now, Ma. Please? Every time "Not now." Ma... So long I keep quiet and now I cannot keep quiet. My mouth must open. Ma... Your father. Sick, still work so hard. I ask you to go and find tuition, still never do. I said I was going to. Say, say, say. Always say, never do. Ma, it's been a difficult time at school, okay? What's so difficult? This is only the beginning. Mrs. Phua say her daughter every day come back early. Ma, can we talk about this some other time? Every day I see your father. And his daughter go where? Go disco. I never go disco. Then go where? Go out with your boyfriend? Don't think you are so clever. I never do anything wrong. I just go to school and sometimes I go out. It's not easy, okay? I am trying. Tom? Hi, may I please speak to... Yeah? Mui Ee, this is Kai. Who is that? Why so late still call? Who? It's not late. Kai. It's about 9:00, but... Kai? Yeah. I said hi to you, remember? Put down the phone! Why? Nothing. Well, actually, I just called because... Who is that? Ma, it's my friend, okay? Later, please? Maybe I should call another time? Yeah. Okay, bye. Wait... Kai, right? Yeah. Sorry, I... Hey, no, I understand. Actually, well, I just called because... Yeah? Well... I've seen you in school and I just want to say hi. Yeah? Are you okay? Yeah. Well, if you need anyone, well, you know... Yeah. Okay. Take care, Mui Ee. You, too. Yeah? Do you... Never mind. Thanks anyway. Anytime. Bye. Bye. Attention, students and staff. This is your principal Dr. E Sopramaniam, MA, East Anglia, PhD, Calcutta. It has come to my attention that Valentine's Day is occurring next week. This is a decadent colonial Western tradition. And we in the East must preserve our values and not fall into this trap. All lessons and extracurricular activities will proceed as usual on that day. Teachers are to ensure discipline. As students, your duty is to complete your education. Not engage in permissive activities like sending poems or flowers. And now Mr. Ngor has some announcements. Thank you. The first announcement, we have made special arrangements for students to get a discount when you order your Valentine's flowers through your class representatives-- Mr. Ngor! I just told the students, no flowers. Weren't you listening? But all students must not order. Thank you. -Kai. -Yeah? Can you molest Sissy so that I can save her and she'll be eternally grateful and will go out with me on Valentine's Day? -Sean. -Yeah? Have you ever gone for a CAT scan? I don't have a cat. So are you going to molest her or not? Sometimes I wonder what goes on in your brain, okay? Would you like a ride somewhere? No, thanks. I'm waiting for Hari, my fiancé. Well, there's no excuse for being late. He's not, I'm early. So, next week's the big day. The big... Right, yeah. Are you sure you wouldn't like a ride? Quite sure. Well, see you. -Miss Boon... -Yes? Why do you hate me? Hate you? I don't hate you. Well, you seem so cold towards me. I'm not. Okay, I am. I don't mean to. It's just that sometimes you're so... ang moh, you know? I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. It's just... I've got to go. Bye. Kai, do you know how much Sissy means to me? -How much? -Well, a lot. My Valentine's Day must not be wasted. Every year, I date a beautiful woman, and this year must not be different. It's tradition, you know? Look, if you're that desperate, why don't you go up to her and ask her? Kai, I know that you have very little experience with women, but surely you must know a high-quality woman like Sissy wouldn't just go out with any Tom, Dick or Harry. Let's eat out today. Let me shower first? Never mind. Okay. -Western? -Japanese? Just keep driving. So, how's your friend Mr. Mills? You know, he can be really impossible sometimes. He's so forward like only a Western-educated type can be. But that's good. You know, sometimes I think we're too reserved. You see, kids these days, right, don't know how to think, analyze. They don't even know how to speak. It's because teachers like me aren't doing enough. I didn't say that. I did. It's the education system. The stress is always on the results. You know, process, failure, and all that. People don't understand that you can learn from making mistakes, from falling. I think you missed the turn back there. Shit. Relax, honey. Learn from your mistake. Attention, this is Dr. E Sopramaniam, MA, East Anglia, PhD, Calcutta. This is a reminder that all students and staff will remain in school until the end of the school day. And all educational activities will proceed as usual. No one must leave the school premises to celebrate Valentine's Day. We must always be alert and vigilant against these attacks... What a day for the car to break down. I hope the tow truck comes soon. Some other horoscope said that it was going to be a good day for me today. Who's that? Sissy Song. Fashionably late for the Valentine's party, as usual. So happy that my life is going down the toilet. No. Hello, is anyone out there? Michelle? Shu Mei? Hello? Help! Help! Open the door! Hello? The walls are so clean and white. Sissy Song, I've come to save you. Isn't there anyone else around? Sissy Song, coolest, prettiest girl in school. You think you have the right to insult people, is it? You're so cheap. Look, you pervert. Just open the door. Go out with me and I'll open the door. Over my dead body. Fine, then have a nice weekend. Wait! -Okay. -What? I'll go out with you. What? I can't hear you. I said I'll go out with you. I'll go out with you on one condition. Anytime, my girlfriend. I'm not your girlfriend and I'm bringing a friend along. Who's he? What's his name? It's a girl, you idiot. And you bring a guy friend. What? Double date? Well, take it or leave it. Now open the door. You tell anyone about this, I'll personally castrate you, understand? I get to send you home? Hello? Hello, Kai? -Sean, yeah? -Yeah, guess what. I finally managed to convince Sissy to ask that Mui something to go out with you. What? Wait. I'll tell you later. Traffic police. But it's Valentine's Day. Every other girl in school has plans. I'm going home now. It's a tradition to have a date on Valentine's Day, Mui. Well, I haven't lived long enough for any tradition. Anyway, why does it have to be him of all people? I told you that there was no one else around at that time and at least you got Kai. I got that Kok Sean, okay? And besides, you owe me. I warned you about Tom, remember? And I got abuse from you in return. Okay, I'm sorry. Look, Sissy. You're my best friend, you should understand me. Fine. What are you doing? Calling Sean. It's just going to be him and me. I'm gonna die. Never mind, I'll go along. Okay. And that was an instrumental track from The Teenage Textbook Movie, "Cocktail 17," right here on 987 FM. Let's move on to our first caller on this Valentine's night. Hello, Perfect Ten. Hello, my name is Byron. Yes, Byron, what's the problem? Well, I'm a male model and girls like to ask me out on dates and stuff. So, tonight I've got two girls who are very beautiful and rich, so who do you think I should go out with? Well, Byron, I think I know what the problem is. -You do? -Yes. The problem is... people like you make me sick! Next caller. Hello? Hello. Michelle here. I'd just like to say that I think Valentine's Day is a day created by corporations in order to cheat people of their money by selling them expensive cards and overpriced flowers. I mean, every day should be Valentine's Day, right? You don't need to have a special day to show someone that you really care. Let me guess, you didn't get a date for tonight, did you? No... Sean, why are you wearing those sunglasses? The light's too glaring. But it's nighttime. Hey, isn't that a pimple? No, it's not! Hey, look, stop staring at me and keep your eyes on the road. But you're the one that's driving. Well, help me to look! I can't see with these sunglasses on. Sean! Watch out for the cat! -Hello? -Hi, Mui Ee, it's me. Tom? Yep. I'll pick you up in ten minutes? No! Wait! Tom, I'm not going out with you tonight. Why not? Have to stay home and sulk, is it? No, I have a date. It's not you. Hey, if this is about Maggie... I've got another call, Tom. Hey, don't hang up on me. Hello? Mui Ee, we're downstairs already. Come down now before I strangle Sean with the safety belt. Okay. I told you, no evidence. Sean. I told you, no Pao-lo's. I don't want a romantic restaurant. I just want a place where we can get the food quickly, eat and go home. Okay, my sweet Sissy. No Pao-lo's. Got it. We'll go for somewhere classy but with fast service. Sean, you just went through a red light! Just take off those sunglasses before you get us all killed, okay? Don't worry, I'm just here to pick up some cakes. We're not going to be eating here. So... how well have you known Sissy? We've been best friends for about eight years now. Eight years. Well, me and Sean about the same time as well. You know, Sean can be quite a pain sometimes, but if you really get to know him, he's really very nice. He got a date with Sissy and he asked me to come along. Actually, I'm here because of Sissy as well. Yeah. Of course I know. Well... since this is Valentine's Day, why not let's make the most of it? Okay. You look really nice tonight. Thanks, you, too. Thanks. I hope the waiter doesn't give Sissy any sharp utensils. Don't worry. At the rate Sean's going, he'll probably stab himself with the bread knife before Sissy gets a chance. Yeah, right. You know, actually, if you think about it, do you think Sean and Sissy look compatible? I don't think so. I mean, he's not her type. Okay. But... if Sissy never finds that special someone, maybe she'll just have to settle for Sean, right? I guess so. But I think when you meet that special someone, you'd feel magical? How's your evening been? Good. Tonight you go home yourself, okay? I've got Sissy eating out of my hand. Okay, sure. We'll just take a cab. Thanks, friend. Anytime, friend. Did you enjoy your Valentine's Day dinner, Mui Ee? Tom! Come on, let's go. You have a date with me, remember? What are you doing? Leave her alone. And you're going to make me? Get lost, Tom. Let's go, Mui. The next track goes out to all Valentine's Day suckers. May your overpriced dinner be worth it in the end. Sean, this had better be important. I was peeing halfway. You know what it's like when you stop and I'm still in my boxers and-- Hello? Chung Kai? Mui Ee? Sorry for calling so late. Late? No, it's not late. It's a bad time, right? No, not at all. You need to go? No, I can control. You want to put something on first? No. I mean, I will. Well, I just wanted to know if you got back safely. Yeah. And I had a really good time. Me, too. Look, I've got to go. My dad's around. Okay. I'll see you at lunch tomorrow? Why? I mean, sure! Yeah, of course! Yes. Okay, bye. Bye. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, life follows a very different path from the one you planned and worked towards. And if the results are not so bad, do you just go along with whatever's happening, or try to put your life back on the other track and wait for that special someone that's meant for you? So, where are we going? Paya Lebar Hawker Centre. We'll take the bus. It'll be my treat. Luxury date. Our results are coming out next week. How do you think you'll fare? Okay. You? Same here. 987, all hits all day. It's 1:30 a.m. on the Ego Trip on 987 FM. And from my understanding, there are only nine 16 year-olds who are asleep, because the O-Level results are being released later today. As for the rest, I'm sure many of you are anxious about whether you'll be staying or changing schools. So if you are, why not give us a call right now and talk to us on 6911987. Hello, Perfect Ten. Hello? Hi, my name is Kok... Kok Sean. Okay, Kok Sean. So what's on your mind? Well, let's say... Let's say tomorrow if my friend got the results and he gets an A1 when he usually fails. I mean, they wouldn't try to see if I'd bought the answers from some guy in the alley who actually tried to charge me twice the amount but luckily I didn't bring my wallet. Right. Yeah, something like that. You mean like cheating? Well, cheating is such a strong word. How about creative exam-taking? I'm not so sure. Well, let me see. Your number starts with 46. You must be living somewhere in Bukit Timah, right? Are you trying to trace my call? -No, of course not. -Okay, bye. Exam results are the most stressful thing in the world. A simple alphabet and a number determines the school you can go to, what courses you can take, and what jobs you end up with later in life. It's a turning point you have no control over. Kai got his results earlier in the morning and paged me to tell me the bad news. And while I waited for my own results, I didn't know whether to hope for the best, or maybe even to get results that weren't so great, so that Kai and I would still end up in the same school, wherever that turned out to be. Tears of sadness and tears of joy. This was the scene today as the O-Level examination results were released. Not only are the students here at Kampong Arang Secondary School hopeful of retaining their places at their favorite colleges, but those who hadn't previously qualified are hoping that their final results will also secure them places at their colleges. GCS spoke to a few of them. I've got ten A1s. I'd like to thank all of those that helped me and I'm really grateful to them. And my geography teacher, my physics teacher, my biology teacher, my geography teacher, everyone! Including my dog! Even if I failed, I think it'd be okay. I'll look on the bright side. Besides, I think it'd be cool if I can spend another year in school with my friends, you know. But won't your friends be going on to other junior colleges and aren't you afraid of being left behind? Shit! But you can stay at PJC, right? I don't know. I'm sure you can, Kai. I mean, PJ is not, like, a top college. Anyway, you're going to a top college, right? I'm not sure. Kai, it's not that... I have to go! Wait, Mui. Can't we just... See? See? You see? Ma, we're just friends. Just friends! Some people got boyfriend, want to blab other people? Ma, I did well on my O-Levels, and it's only my first year. I think you should stop your studies. Education, education. Where education? What you do? Every day go out, come back late. Still talk on the phone. What for study? Go out and work better. Why can't you trust me? Trust you? I trust you. You say promise. You say won't go out late, won't talk to boys on the phone. You say promise. I listen. I trust. Now you see what happened? What? What happened? What did I do? You blab me! Your own mother! Hey, I haven't finished with you... From now on, every day you must come back early! You cannot go out with boys and you cannot use the phone! Mui, I really don't see what the problem is. If I were you, I'll tell my mother that I'll stop seeing Chung Kai. Then I'd say I'm with my girls whenever I'm on a date with him. Yeah, but what if she finds out? How would she find out? I mean, what if our relatives and friends see me and Kai together? She'll kill me for lying to her. But you're already lying to her. No... Well, you tell her that he's just a friend, which he isn't. So you're lying. So I should lie more? No, you should hang on to Kai because you'll never find another one like him. Yeah, he's cute, right? Well, I don't really know about that, but he's got "dependable" and "stable" written all over his face. You know, you should find someone like him. Yeah, right, someone like him, I'll get diabetes. Sissy's rule number 38, my man's got to have the body of a swimmer, the mind of a computer programmer and the personality of a rabbit. Personality of a rabbit? You know, tame. Rabbits have no personality. Okay, whatever that's kind and gentle, and worships me morning, noon, and... Meow. Morning, noon and meow? Mui, slap me. Tan, broad shoulders. Must be a swimmer. Except for the fact that his hair wasn't shoulder-length, Daniel Boon was the kind of guy you’d find painted on the covers of teenage romance novels. And Sissy Song was the kind of girl who bought these books just for the covers. I'd like to see him in a pair of Speedos. Sissy... You won't understand. You're practically married. Yikes. Speedo Boy is that weirdo's friend. Can you tell me where the library is? The library? Don't you know where it is by now? -Well, I'm-- -Second intake student. Yeah. Nice watch, but mine's better. I'm Daniel. You are? Very rich. But you can call me Sean. So, Daniel, what's your calling in PJC? Calling? Your class. Class S34A. Isn't that where Shu Mei and Madeline and Ding Wei are? Yeah, I think so. So Mr. Mills teaches your class? Yeah, that's the one. So, have they told you about Mills and Boon? No. Well, people are saying Mr. Mills is sleeping with Miss Boon. Miss Boon is my sister. Yeah, right. And I'm James Lye. She is. I'm Daniel Boon. Daniel Boon? Wait. So you are Miss Boon's brother? Don't take me seriously, I'm always joking. See? Look, can you just tell me where the... What? Hot babe. Sissy. Sissy Song. Sissy Song. Yeah. My girlfriend. Yeah, right. You don't believe me? Come on! I'll introduce you. Hi, babe. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Daniel Boon. Hi, I'm Daniel. Well, got to go. Bye. Cool girlfriend. She's the best. You're one lucky man. I sure think so. If there's one thing I like about Sissy, it's that she never lets her prejudice get to her. I guess she figured that if Kai was Sean's friend, and he was okay, then there's a remote possibility that Dreamboat Daniel might turn out to be okay, too. All she needed to do was to turn on the old Sissy charm. Hi, Daniel. Hi, Sissy. How's things? Okay, what about you? All right, just trying to catch up on what I've missed. Maths! I hate it. I can't even get my tutorial done. Maybe I can help. Yeah, I was hoping that you'd say that. And, of course, Sissy forgot to mention that she had just got A1 in her O-Level maths. Thanks for your help. If only Mrs. Louise can teach math like you. It's easy when you like the... subject. It's been a pleasure working with you. Yeah, and walking with you. -I'm taking 92. -Me, too! I thought you're going the other direction. I need to go somewhere first. Let's not go back yet, okay? Let's go and catch a movie. Movie? It's the middle of the week. So? Kai, don't make this difficult. Anyway, you should go home and finish your history essay. I have enough time to do it tonight. Please, let's just go out, okay? Another time, okay? I'm not asking you to take drugs or something, you know. Why doesn't your mother understand? Okay. What about Saturday? Every time Saturday. When the day comes, you say next Saturday. We haven't done anything for weeks, okay? Kai, my mother thinks that you'll cause my downfall. I'll spend all my time talking to you on the phone, skipping classes, failing classes, getting pregnant and all that. Tell you what, we'll catch the 5:45 show and we'll be back by 8:00, okay? -I promise. -Kai, what do you want from me? I just want to watch a movie. Any movie, a Hindi movie. I don't care. As long as I'm watching it with you, Mui. I can't. I think you should just go and become a nun. Every bit of my brain is telling me that Kai's being unreasonable. So why am I feeling like the bad guy? Why do I feel like I'm the one who just drove away in a car and left him alone at the bus stop? I mean, I like being around Kai and all that. But what if he's not the one? All hits all day, 987 FM. Hello, Glenn, this is Melissa. Yes, Melissa. What's your question? How will I know when I find true love? Love question. Dr. Adam, what do you think? Does true love even exist? I'd like to think so, Glenn. So how will I feel when I meet him? Will I just know? Melissa, there's no Spider-Sense that will tingle to tell you who's the one and who's not. You have to really get to know that person. So, Adam, have you found true love? I have, Glenn. I met her seven years ago and last year, I made her mine. Only last year? I thought you got married much earlier. No, Glenn. I bought my 1967 BMW convertible last year. She was a real beauty. Real leather seats, original steering wheel, wood paneling, V12 engine, 200 horsepower. It's a fantastic job... Hello? Hello, can I speak to Sissy, please? Yes? Hi, Sissy. It's Daniel. I think I took your book by mistake. Really? Yeah. Probably my fault. I must have switched it when we were doing maths. It's okay, no problem. I'll pick it up from you tomorrow, and I think I should give you a reward for finding my book. Yeah, sure. What about a drink tomorrow? Okay, 1:30 after class? Great. Daniel, do you like rabbits? What do you mean? Never mind. Hey. Are you taking part in the PJC contest next week? I don't know. Why not? I'm sure you'll win. I mean, who else can beat Sissy Song? I'll even be your manager. You know, you're the second person who offered. The first was your friend, Kok Sean. My friend... Look, I have to go. I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay? Bye. Who is it? Chong Gay. Chong Gay? Every time Chong Gay. Mui, I feel like I'm being juggled around. I just don't know what to do with Daniel. Well, Sissy, I guess for once you'll just have to get used to not being in control of the relationship. Hey, I have no problems with not being in control. It's the not-understanding part that I don't, you know, understand. Okay, so he asked to be your manager for the beauty contest, which is good. And then you had cappuccinos together and nothing happened, which is bad. But at least now you know how I feel, -which is good. -No, it's worse. I mean, I've read some of these kinds of stories and I know he feels it, too, but nothing. Mui, this has never happened to me before. -And look. -Where? I mean look, but don't look. He's always with that Chong Gay guy. Do you think Daniel is... Daniel? But... But Daniel is sweet and helpful and... Well, he likes to swim and he likes his mother. Oh, my God. Daniel? Go talk to her. I want to but... she's with Sean. I don't want to cause their breakup. Honey, you'll be doing them a favor. Hi, Miss Boon. -Join us. -Sure. How's work? Okay. Actually, Miss Boon... Mui has something to ask you. Yeah, you said you wanted to ask Miss Boon something, something, something. Something, something, something? Yeah, quick, ask. What is it? If a girl likes this guy... And she's quite cute. Not all the time. Well, this cute girl likes this cute guy. And the guy doesn't respond. So what do you think is the problem? -Well-- -I mean, Miss Boon, you're old and all that. You have a lot of experience. Have you come across anything like that before? Well, in the first place, just because a girl is cute doesn't mean every guy is going to be attracted to her. But what if she's really gorgeous? Well, there could be a number of reasons. Okay, let me tell you a story. When I was in uni, there was this girl in my class. She was absolutely gorgeous. Model. Top of the faculty. And, of course, all the boys were throwing themselves at her feet from morning to night. But she had her sights set on only this one guy. This one guy only who was smart like her. Swimmer. Perfect body. But, you know, he just didn't seem interested in her. What happened in the end? I mean, was he gay or what? No. But she got married to someone else, had three kids, migrated to Australia. And never found out why this guy didn't like her. You told them about Gabrielle going to Perth. Sure. Just to show them that they're not going to find simple solutions to everything in life. Isn't that just a little too cynical for kids their age? But they're not kids anymore, Hari. These are grown-up problems. I know some people our age are still having problems like these. Hey, I think you're referring to your friends, not mine. okay? What? How can you say that after the way Jack showed us how you could burp to the tune of "La Bamba"? I can't imagine the Air Force gives you guys million-dollar planes to fly. Bye. Debbie, Debbie. What is it, Ma? I... I think it's Daniel. He likes boys. This whole thing with Daniel and Chong Gay was just driving Sissy crazy. Her not knowing if he is or isn't. It's so hard to tell nowadays. Sissy's a take-charge kind of person. But how can you take charge if you don't know who's what? She told me she was going home to meditate until she figured out a solution. I hope she figures out a solution soon, because there's only so much meditation a person's metabolism can take. And as for things between Kai and me, well, instead of letting this whole situation get out of hand, I decided to get off my butt and do something about it. So I figured that if Ma could actually meet Kai, she might stop thinking of him as some boy, but as a real person. So I asked if Kai could come over for dinner. Well, maybe she was feeling generous, or even just as tired as I was of the whole thing, because she actually said yes. Hello? Hi, Sissy? Hi, it's Daniel. Are you busy? No, why? Look... Would you like to have dinner with me? Okay. There's a condition, Sissy. Yeah? If you come for dinner, I'd like you to... become my girlfriend. Hello? Hello? Yeah, okay! Let me explain. You see, my parents think that I'm... gay. Is it true? It's a long story. You see, whenever I'm talking to you on the phone, I tell them that I'm talking to another guy. Well, I didn't want them to think that I'm always out just chasing girls. Which guy? Chong Gay. Anyway, I kind of told them that I have a... girlfriend. You. So... will you do it? Please? I won't ask anything else. Okay. Great. Thanks. Woman, help me out. Now what? I need your advice on what to wear on a date. You, Sissy Song, asking moi for advice? Okay. First, you should wear a bra. Okay, that's a good point, but what else? I mean, his parents are like the conservative, boring type. I have to dress like you. Okay. First, you choose a color. Black? No. Red? No. Black and red? No, not really. Do you have something, like, lighter, pastel or beige? I think I've got a peach dress somewhere. Okay. Now shoes. I've got black leather boots that can go very well as shoes. Sis, Mui's rules. No black, no leather, no boots. All hits all day, 987 FM. Welcome back to 987 FM. We're on the topic of meeting parents. Hello, Perfect Ten? Hi, Glenn. My name is Chong Gay. And I was just listening to what the previous caller said, and I just want to say that I was offended and disgusted by what she said she was going to do. But all she said was that she was going to wear her mom's silk dress and conservative leather shoes to meet her boyfriend's parents. Well, I think she's just trying to be controversial by telling us that. I mean, she shouldn't even attempt to wear a silk dress with leather. The fabrics just clash, man. It's as good as yelling, "Hello, world, look at me! I don't understand my hard and soft fabrics." What? That outfit is not very you. I really appreciate what you're doing for me. Girlfriend for a day. Now I know what a social escort feels like. I'm just kidding, don't worry. I'll look at you with such longing that your mother will never know that I'm just... Just pretending. -Hello Miss Boon. -Hello, Sissy. You're looking tame. It's my new look, Miss Boon. Yeah, right. Mom, Daniel's friend is here. See you, kids. Enjoy yourselves. -Bye. -Bye. So, you are Sissy. Hi, Auntie. Come. Come in and sit down. I like your dress. It's very pretty. Thank you, Auntie. It's a gift from Daniel. Really? Where did you buy it from, Dan? Club 21. Sissy, would you like a drink? No, thank you, Auntie. I'm fine. So how long have you known each other? -Three months. -Three weeks. How long? -Three weeks. -Three months. You're confusing me. What we mean is... What do we mean, Sissy? We mean that we met three months ago, but only confirmed our relationship three weeks ago. -Right? -Right, right. Mom, don't you have to go? It's getting late. Excuse me, I must go to my mahjong game. You know, Sean? I heard Sissy's going to be taking part in the Miss PJC pageant. Yeah, she's sure to win. Everybody knows that. That's true. But I also heard that Linda's going to take part as well. I hope not. You know she gets so emotional about losing, plus, she always comes crying to you when that happens. I know. Kai, aren't you a little underdressed tonight? I mean, at least a tie, right? What do you mean? I mean, when you propose to Mui. Sean, I'm just meeting Mui's mom tonight. I'm not getting engaged, you know. Okay. So I guess there won't be a bachelor party next week. Nope. Thanks for the lift. You can go now. But it's going to rain. You have a car. But this is going to be fun. I mean, I've never been inside a three-room HDB flat before. It's good to see how the other side lives. Which number? Is it this one? What's the number? You must tell me. Which number is it? 13-05. I know it's this one. 13... No, it's not. Here, 13-05. Sean, can you just leave before someone comes out? Hi, Kai. Hi, Sean. Come inside, come inside. Mom, this is Kai and Sean. -Hi, Auntie. -Hi, Auntie. So where's the rest of the house? I feel like Japanese food tonight. You want to try The Okinawa at Shenton Way? No, I think you should just keep driving. You know we can't get a table at Okinawa, not at this hour. Yeah. You hungry? Yes, very. You know, I've been thinking... about what you said the other day, about, you know... talking and being open. Yeah? Well, Deb. I don't just want you to be my fiancée, I want you to be my wife. We'll have a terrific wedding. A military wedding. And my squadron can perform a fly-past. We'll have the best wedding ever. I don't care about the wedding as long as you are-- We'll be the happiest couple on earth, and after the wedding, it's off to Australia we go. Sydney, here we come. Hari, please. I've been to Australia. Let's go to Europe for our honeymoon. Honeymoon? No, no. I meant that we should move to Sydney. I've got two uncles living there already, so it won't be a problem. We can bring our kids up as Australian. Wouldn't that be great? But I don't want to spend the rest of my life in Australia. We can come back once or maybe twice a year. You're not listening, Hari. I don't want to spend the rest of my life-- Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me? Look, Deb. You know how I feel about living here, right? And you, you keep complaining about your job all the time. You hate being a teacher. You always complain about everything from the Ministry of Education, to the weather, -to the-- -You're not being fair. I love being a teacher. And this is my home. All my friends are here, my family is here. And you think I'm about to give all this up just to follow you to some strange country and start rebuilding my life all over again? But my uncle's already got me a job as a navigator on one of the domestic airlines there. Don't you see? We've got it made. And I guess you didn't think it was necessary to consult me. I mean, you just thought I'd go along with whatever you decided. Why didn't you tell me? You, of all people. Okay. I'm sorry, all right? I just wanted to pick the right time to tell you, that's all. Look. Just say yes, okay? Why? Why do you want to leave? Why do you want to stay? If I decide to stay, what will you do? It's not fair. Don't ask me to make that sort of choice. Look... I want to go. I'm asking you to make that choice. I need to know. I don't like your boyfriend. No manners. You just met him. Five seconds, already I can tell. The way he looked at our flat. Too low-class for him. He's no good. You cannot go out with him. Ma, just give him a chance. okay? How do they live here? I mean, where does the maid sleep? They don't have a maid. That's not funny, Kai. What? Next you'll be telling me they don't even have a car. Sean, if you don't go now, I'm gonna throw you down a corridor. Talking about corridor, shouldn't it be wider or something? I mean, what if someone wants to buy a piano and they-- -Go. -Okay, okay. -No air-- -Sean, just please go now, okay? Where did Kai go? I'm Kai, Auntie. Sean has something on, so he left first. You are Kai? Yeah. You are Kai! Thanks, Auntie. No promises. They never deliver here. Somehow this area doesn't exist to them. So what would you like? A Tahiti Supremo or a Singapore Special? I don't really like those. Well, neither do I. But I think that's the only two kinds that they have. That's where you're wrong. Those are the only two kinds that they think they have. Watch and learn. Hello, pizza delivery? Yes, hi. May I find out what kinds of pizza do you have? Okay, Tahiti Supremo and Singapore Special? Fine. But say I'm allergic to certain ingredients. Do you actually take special orders? Okay, thank you. She's checking. What exactly are you allergic to? What do you mean? Haven't you seen my reaction to boring food? Hello, yes, sorry. I'm still here. Okay, this is my order. I'm going to have Tahiti Supremo but no capsicum, please. Just olives and mushrooms. Yep. And no anchovies, please. Okay, great. Can I have the garlic for garlic bread, instead of the normal, ordinary garlic? Yeah, okay. Thank you. Hello? The cheese topping, please make sure that it's freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Yes, only freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Thank you. Got it? Great, 221B Radley Road. Okay, thank you very much. What? That was... That was amazing. I mean, you just got them to create a whole new pizza for us. Well, some people are good with computers and some people are just good with pizza deliveries. Ma, Kai and I will clear up. Yeah. Got a boy, now you're so hardworking. Ma... Auntie go downstairs for a while. Auntie go first. Walk properly, Auntie. Floor very slippery. Bye, Ma. She's going to adopt you now. Mui. You know tomorrow, right, we finish classes early because of the beauty contest. Do you want to catch a movie? Maybe. Why? Well, because I thought since we're going to the ball on Saturday... So... So, what? Well... Forget it. Just forget that I mentioned it, okay? Kai, it's not that I don't want to go. Then what? You asked me for dinner, I'm here. Your mother is great. I really like her and I think she likes me, too. So what is the problem? What does it take for you to go on a movie with me? What, Mui Ee? Now you can tell your mother that you're talking to me whenever you're talking to me. Thanks for coming over. And thanks for being my girlfriend. Yeah, for tonight. I have to go. Why don't I send you home? No, it's okay. Can you help call a cab? It's easy to get one outside. I'll walk you out. No, really, it's okay. Thanks for dinner. You. Don't scratch my car. Her hair looks nice tonight. I haven't reached the high yet. I'm going to wish her luck. Hi, Nikky. Hi, Sean. Hello, Sissy. You paged? Yeah, Mui. Why don't you come down? Don't you have your Miss PJC contest to do? Yeah, it's coming up soon. Why don't you come down? I can't, Sissy. I don't know what to say to Kai. I don't know what to do. But you must come. I'm just not in the mood, okay? Look. How long are you going to agonize over this? Are you going to avoid Kai like you did to Tom? Maybe you should give Kai a chance. He might not turn out to be another romance-novel hunk like Tom D'Crap. But I'm not looking for another Tom. So are you looking for another Kai? Just not tonight, okay? I just want to be alone. Then let's do something instead. Sis, you stay there and win. And, yes, I want you to do something. What? I want you to talk to Daniel. There's nothing to talk about. I just have to accept reality and the reality is he's just not interested. Anyway, I have to go. Wish you were here. Okay. Tell me all about it tomorrow, okay? Good luck. Sissy, can you tell us what's your idea of a perfect boyfriend? I think a perfect boyfriend should be a perfect gentleman. She looks good, doesn't she? Where's Mui Ee? At home. Sometimes I just don't understand. ...before she deserved him. Well put. "My Special Angel" by Ger. On 987 FM, for you, if you're stuck at home right now on this Saturday night. Why aren't you out with your friends? Had a fight? Or worse still, no friends? What's wrong with you? Life is short. Turn around if you're going the wrong way. I thought you had a school party to go to. Ma. Leave it alone, don't throw it away. If you don't want it, throw it away. If you want it, treat it properly. Hi, Miss Boon. What are you doing after this? Going home. Say we hang around, and "La Bamba." "La Bamba"? Mills. Sometimes I get really worried about you. Anyway, I've got to meet someone. What? The fighter-pilot guy? Yeah. The fighter-pilot guy. What about us? Us? There's no us, Mills. You're my colleague. We're friends. Is that all? All hits all day, 987 FM. Uncle, are you sure this is the fastest way there? Don't worry, miss. My taxi is always the fastest one. In ten minutes, you'll be at your party. Okay. Here's a clue to what's wrong with this picture. You're here, and she's at home. Come on, Kai. Talk, shout, cry, whatever. But sitting here is not going to solve anything. Yeah, I know. Come on, we're "action" men. We're buddies, remember? Hey, that's Nikki. Hi, Nikki. Look, I got to go. Call Sissy, she'll knows what to do. Chung Kai, I've lost again. It's okay, Linda. Great. Mui Ee. Congrats. Congrats? I don't care what anyone else says. I think you're the true princess. Daniel, what do you want from me? Why do you keep playing this game? I just don't want to... You know. No, I don't know. Look, I know you and Sean are having some problems. I don't want to make it any worse. What? I mean, what Sean? Your boyfriend? My what? You've got to be kidding. Wait. You mean you're not with... Which means you're... Yeah! But you were... you know... in me. Why didn't you... I mean, I thought that you're... You thought that I was... Yeah, I mean, you cook and you love your mom. So? I know, so... You're not... Which means... Mui Ee. I couldn't have come at a better time. What's next? Get a room here? What are you talking about? Don't use jealousy as an excuse, okay? What excuse? I don't know. To get rid of me? I'm not getting rid of you. Then what? Mui, I know how I feel about you, but can you say the same about me? Don't confuse me, okay? Look. Are you still waiting for that special someone? I don't know. Why? I don't know. Why? I said I don't know, Kai. Yeah, and I want to know why. If it's not your mom, not school, it's not exams, not me., it's not anything, then what is it? I don't know. I just don't know, okay? I don't want to lose you. I don't want to buy a present, wrap it up, get all excited about giving it to you and then see you with another girl. I don't want to go out for the sake of going out and then break up when it's not fun anymore. I mean, if I didn't care for you so much, it wouldn't hurt when you leave. Who says I'll leave? What have I done to make you feel that? I don't know. Not now. Maybe next week, next month, next year. Mui, what are you talking about? I know I'm not making sense, okay? But that's just how I feel. Yeah, that's just how I feel. So, when are you leaving? Next week, on the fourth. It's just an initial visit to see my uncle. I'll send him my papers in about two to three months' time, then... I guess you're really going. I can't stay. Finally, in my life, I meet someone I love. The fighter-pilot guy. And it's over. I'll write to you. What's the point? You know, we should just go our separate ways. Who knows? We might bump into each other when we're, say, 70? Not me. I'm going to die young. That explains the way you drive. Bye, Hari. I'll miss you. Bye. I'm sorry. Sorry? Sorry for mistaking you for my friend's sister. Sorry for giving you a lift home and ending up shopping for carpets. Sorry for those long, endless drives along the east coast. Sorry for falling in love with you. I'm sorry. I'm not. Take care, Hari. Bye. Bye. Can't the DJ play a fast song? You want him to get stoned to death, is it? The couples here waited all night for this. And Mui, can you take care of my bag for me? Hello, Sissy? Sissy, you have to talk to Mui for me. I mean, I know we have our problems, but we can take it one step at a time, right? And I'm sure there's special feeling. We just have to believe in it for it to work out, right? I just won't let her give up on us, because I'm not. You have to tell her. okay, Sissy? Will you do that for me, please? Hello? Hello, Sissy? Hello? Are you there? You really look nice tonight. Thanks. You, too. Hi. Hi. You look nice tonight. Thanks. And so, despite all our friends, parents, school and stuff, we survived teenhood and lived happily ever after. You know, maybe someone should write a book about this. They could call it The Teenage Textbook. Nah. Who would buy it?
