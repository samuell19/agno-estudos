My family lived in Arnold Grove in the 1940s. The Liverpool Blitz was terrifying, and I will never forget as a child the drone of sirens and approaching bombers. The Grove's a really neighbourly place and we were always in and out of each other's homes. What was strange for me was the music coming out of the house at number 12, the home with the Harrison family. George's mother Louise loved to listen to Indian music on the radio. I'm told that it helped to keep her calm during her pregnancy. When I first heard Indian music, I just couldn't really believe that it was so, so great. And the more I heard of it, the more I liked it, and it just got bigger and bigger, like a snowball. One day, the telephone rang and my father always answered it. He had a particular sort of authentic Indian accent. His Indian accent had remained unchanged in all the 40 years he'd been here, and he was shouting down the telephone, "Ringo who, Ringo who?" And apparently it was because Ringo was on the other end of the line asking my father whether he had a spare sitar string. The return of the heroes to their native land. They conquered the colony. The Beatles, who originated as a small-time act out of Liverpool, now have no rivals as the kingpins of the teenage set. The group had certainly turned Liverpool into Britain's answer to any pop trends from across the Atlantic. On every side there is hero worship that recall the heydays of Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra. Beatlemania has ceased to be a phenomenon and seems to have become a way of life. My father had never heard of The Beatles so he knew nothing about anything European or popular. But what happened was that they'd broken a sitar string while George was recording "Norwegian Wood" in Abbey Road Studio. EMI knew my father because he was often the person they came to when they required a group of musicians. So, when the string broke, they found my father and he did have one, amazingly, he did have a set of sitar strings. So the whole family got in the tiny little car and they all drove to carry one string to Abbey Road and there they handed it over and they watched them recording. It started with the Indian music. I like so many Indian instruments, but mainly sitar. I'd used a little sitar on our records. The Beatles had already discovered Indian music, I think when they were making "Help!" Which is, of course, the story of a mystic Eastern religious group, and they are after Ringo Starr's ring. So they'd already discovered, and there's that famous scene about them going into a restaurant. On the set of how a sitar was used in a sort of little group that's playing in the restaurant, George picked it up and was playing with it and sort of got interested in sitar because of that. It was a very inappropriate film for most Indians because that film really lived up to all the stereotypes about India, about bloodthirsty thug cult. The goddess, which was named as Kylie, was really based on a real goddess, the Kali goddess, Hindus are very reverential to her. So the whole film would be offending a lot of Indians. And then there was this book on the yoga. While they're on shoot at Bahamas, the suddenly come across this very diminutive yogi who cycles up to where they are and distributes this book. This is Vishnudevananda, the first illustrated book on yoga going across the West. But I don't think The Beatles paid him much attention. I think much later he thought back and there was this sort of very mysterious connection. The palace of the Queen has lived through many historic events, and it's our privilege today to witness one of the most earth shaking, The Beatles. Fresh from an audience with the Queen, they hold medals indicating they have been made members of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. The Beatles, of course, have proven to be one of Britain's prime exports. They have brought in more foreign exchange than many industries. And the Queen saw fit to reward their economic contribution to the nation. The award entitles The Beatles to put the letters MBE after their names. That was the most miserable time of our lives, was the MBE cop-out period. We got an MBE, which is one of the biggest jokes in the history of this island probably. The great cavalcade of empire makes a grand spectacle. One of the smallest countries on the map is responsible for the mightiest Commonwealth of nations in history. India was always in British lives because of the empire. We knew about tea and we knew about, you know, rubber, but the idea of its music being, in any way, an influence on anything from this country was simply not considered. From the music that I play to get better and better, musicians generally, in the West, progress into, say, modern jazz, but when I first heard Indian music, there was so much more freedom and there was so much more in it compared to jazz. I just couldn't really believe that it was so, so great. I don't know, then I just started to listen to it more and more, and to try and listen a bit closer. And the more I heard of it, the more I liked it. My mother meets The Beatles in India well before I'm even born. I think she, by virtue of being in the "Hindustan Times" at that point, being a preeminent journalist, being a chief reporter, got the opportunity, but didn't really see, my God, the magic of that moment. And you know, I'm always asked, what's the one thing about your mother that you would have really wished you would do. And she's been Indian first woman war correspondent. She's done all kinds of crazy trailblazing thing. And I always look at this photograph and I say, "My God, I wish I had been that person sitting between John and Paul." This was the first time The Beatles had, as a group, come to India. And they symbolised to us, not just a new kind of music. It was almost like symbolising a new kind of life. They represented the whole sixties to us. When I heard they were in Delhi, I went to the Oberoi InterContinental, and I sat in the lobby and everyone was circling all the different entrances of the hotel, waiting for The Beatles to come out by the kitchen entrance, by various ways. I sat near the lift and I waited for Brian Epstein to emerge because I knew he was their manager. And sure enough, after a few hours of waiting, I saw him come down and I sidled up to him and I said, "Excuse me, Mr. Epstein, I am from All India Radio. The government have scheduled an interview with The Beatles." And he stopped in his tracks and looks at me, "How dare you! The boys will not give an interview. How dare you!" I said, "I'm just conveying the decision of the government because this interview has been announced and it would be very embarrassing if this didn't happen." "I will not permit this," he said, "well, I will give the interview." I said, "Good enough for me, sir, Brian Epstein, good enough for me." Is there going to be any change in the sort of work that they do? Possibly, 'cause, as I've said before, there's no dynamic or important change but The Beatles have always progressed. And to progress, they have to change. At seven o'clock I go up in the lift, I get out and I walk to the end of the corridor. I knock and there's Brian Epstein in a bathrobe, sweating. He emerges, walks me across the length of the hotel, opens the suite on the other side of the floor, and then I was in with The Beatles, all four of them. I asked them what they were doing and they said they had an album coming out in a month's time. George Harrison mentioned that he had an Indian influence in one of the songs, which turned out to be, "Love You To." And Paul mentioned that he had a classical arrangement behind one of the songs, which I think must have been "Eleanor Rigby." Even then, they were going to be Indian influences in their songs. I personally hope there'll be more Indian influences just generally in any music because it's worth it. It's very good music. I just like to see it more popular, more people appreciating it. It was the 6th of July, 1966. Some foreigner came, they never knew what the name of the person were, but they were interested in buying some sitars, harmoniums, and tablas and sarod, and that's all. The huge crowd assembled here outside looking the new face of the English people, like the big hair and all that. It was a craze. My father and uncle went to the hotel and show an instrument, and, later on, gave lesson to George Harrison specially. After The Beatles, there was a big craze for sitars, tablas, and other instruments. In a day, in a month, we were selling sitar like hotcake. The famous Beatles, they came in 1966 to our stall. They were dressed very differently so that the people there could not recognise them. And they walked into the store and they started talking about Indian musical instruments, especially the sitar, the tambura, and the sarod, and also the tabla. He was a good sitar player, my father, and he was showing them how to play it and how the finger movements are, how to coordinate both left and right hand, and, you know, how to strike the strings, how to pluck the strings. They asked him whom he learned the sitar from, he said, "With Ravi Shankar." Pa-pa-pa-pa, ah. Like this. Ravi Shankar, as I see it, was really the first ambassador for all musicians, artists, singers, dancers from India to the West. Over the last few years, I heard the name Ravi Shankar mentioned. A good friend of mine told me to buy a record, which I did. This was the first time I'd ever heard Indian music properly. But when I first heard it, I couldn't really, couldn't believe it really. He's also been turned onto Ravi Shankar, by the, like, David Crosby and Roger McGuinn from The Birds. 'Cause Ravi Shankar had appealed to, the sort of the Beat Generation, going back to the fifties actually. It was all part of that kind of ambiance. I'm sure you must have been asked this lots of times before, but what's your opinion of, sort of, English pop groups and American pop groups using the sitar and the Indian influence in their records? It will make me very happy if I see that some people take true interest and learn properly. Because after having played the sitar for 36 years, I feel that one has to give some time to it. Indeed. My father and my mother were running the Asian Music Circle. My father was quite successful at getting musicians to come to this country and he'd put on concerts for them. It was very much for erudite English people, intellectuals who knew about Indian music. Yehudi Menuhin, amazing man. He was the president to the Asian Music Circle, and I think it was through him that Ravi Shankar first came. And George was fascinated by our family, and so he was invited round to spend the afternoon. I think he came round for lunch. Pattie was there as well, and then George came quite regularly. Eventually, I said, if we could get Ravi free, and the time George was free, we'd invite them both together and introduce them and see whether they got on. And the doorbell rang and I rushed to the door and there wasn't George, it was Paul. Then Paul said, "I'm Paul McCartney." And I said, "I know." And he came in and a little while after that, I think George arrived next. And finally we met, very nicely, at somebody's house, having dinner. We met just as two people instead of being a big publicity gimmick. Ravi came in and we just said, "Ravi, this is George, George this is Ravi." And we had a dinner there, we just ate and talked. Paul was a little bit on the outside actually, looking a little bit bored, smoking like a chimney. My young sister went around collecting the cigarette butts to take to school the next day, the used cigarette butts. And from then he offered to give me, to start me off on sitar with a few lessons, which he did. He had many students in India, very talented musicians. So to try to explain what drew George and Ravi Shankar together is not easy because it defies logic. When George Harrison came to me, I didn't know what to think. But I found he really wanted to learn. I never thought our meeting would cause such an explosion. That Indian music could suddenly appear on the pop scene. George said that, "I want to learn the sitar," and Ravi, he said, "Yes, I can teach you, but it's a very difficult instrument to learn, and you will have to spend a lot of time and your fingers will hurt. It's going to be a difficult thing for you to do, but I want you to come to India and I will teach you over there." So when Ravi invited George and me, I was thrilled to be going. You know, 22, I hadn't really thought much about it. I thought of the King's Road and you know, clothes. And we started off in Mumbai. Ravi took us to concerts, private concerts, that he gave in people's houses, and then bigger concerts in front of his students. George Harrison came with his wife, September 1966. You know, Pandit Ravi Shankar picks him up, he takes him to the Taj hotel and within about four hours, the whole of the people in Taj, it was just filled with people and media and fans, just coming in, shouting, "George, George, George." So finally George got just fed up and he told Pandit, "Let's give a press conference, Let's go and talk to the press." So, of course, Pandit Ravi Shankar was the music director of All India Radio for many years. So he said, let's go and do a radio interview, studio one. This is where Pandit Ravi Shankar and George Harrison did an interview. So we searched for it, and we actually opened quite a few spools, dusty spool lying in the side of a corner. And then we found George Harrison, there was a paper inside. It said "George Harrison interview." The tape hadn't been played in maybe 30 years. Good afternoon, George. Good afternoon. We would like to know from you, do you think you could not make a public appearance? If I did want to make a public appearance, I would have come here to do a show, and I would've come with John and Paul and Ringo. It's just like, all our fans who go to school during the week. Well if they go on the holidays and suddenly somebody's making them learn maths and learn English and learn all this, then they don't like to do that when it's their holiday. It's the same for me. I go around having my photograph taken, signing autographs and waving at people, and being a Beatle, and when it comes to my holiday, then, naturally, I want to not be a Beatle, I wanna be me. When I was 19, I went to India. My aunt greeted me at the airport and said, "Do you know that George Harrison is staying at the hotel?" We asked around, you know, "Where's Mr. Harrison," and we weren't told, and then sort of hopped onto the elevator, and we started going to floors, and then eventually there was one floor where there was a waiter standing outside a room. And I don't really know what made me do it, but I sort of hobbled in and George Harrison asked what I was doing there, and I just said, "I would like your autograph, Mr. Harrison." And he said, you know, he sort of, he wasn't too happy about me being there. I also said to him, he had numerous fans outside the hotel, and his words were, which I've never, ever forgotten, "Tell your friends if they like me, to keep away from me." Which I thought was rather nasty, but I needed the autograph. Everything that Ravi had shown us and told us about him, introduced us to, made an impact. He took us to the Ellora Caves, fascinating. And we went to Banaras, Varanasi. Banaras was unbelievable 'cause we came by boat and Ravi had explained to us the whole reason for people coming to Banaras to die. And they would request that they'd be burnt. And I was fascinated by this. The pyres and then the family or the wife or the husband taking it into the Ganges and letting their ashes float away. So Agra, we went to the Taj Mahal. It's beautiful, I love the story surrounding it. It was more exquisite than I could ever have described to anyone. And then, towards the end of our trip, Kumbh Mela. There were all these sadhus walking down the road, and I said, "Ravi, what's they doing?" He said, "They walk hundreds of miles to come into this Kumbh Mela." And I was just watching this spectacle, and all these people, you know, families or groups and sadhus, all of India, it seemed. He also told us about Indian culture and spirituality. Ravi took us to meet his spiritual guru and this man was over 100. And obviously, we didn't know what they were saying, but it wasn't very many words. And Ravi is a reverential towards his guru. Throughout my life I look to the great yogi Taj Mirage, my spiritual guru. As a Hindu, I believe blessing of guru is the most priceless thing in life. It was very moving for me to see somebody as powerful as Ravi, but George adored him. And here he was humbled in front of his guru. Ravi said that there was something that I found in George, where he was so simple, so down to earth, he looked upon me like a guru, like a father, and he had absolutely no airs about him. And that is something -that we also observed- -That's true. When he came to our home, he was absolutely a simple person, not demanding anything. I haven't learned to play the sitar, I mean, Ravi Shankar hasn't learnt to play and he's been playing in 35 years. He was not a sitar player or a star musician, but I have not seen Ravi have so much time for someone. This association, this link, I can only explain it that they must've had some links in a previous life that brought them together. When George and we got connected in '66, it was like wildfire, you know. He's like a son to me. Same thing. Sometimes I feel like his dad as well. He can be. George Harrison, he loved India, he loved Indian music, he loved Indian spirituality. So this thing, you know, pushed Indian classical music on the top, you know, fusion we can call it, Western and Indian classical music. And that was the biggest fusion ever happened. And then Harrison came here to record "Wonderwall" with Indian classical musicians. He was interested in meeting local musicians. The Beatles use the sitars in their record. Somehow we were able to imagine The Beatles as our band, as an Indian band. And you know, India was a closed society and a closed economy, and it was a not very easy to get your hands on albums. In 1962 or very early '63 on the international shortwave, a group of people in Bangalore heard their music and said, "Hey, wait a minute, this is very different." What it did really was to liberate an entire generation from the cultural shackles of the past. The British had left in 1947, this core was born in the late forties or early fifties, mid fifties. When they came of age, they rejected the past and embraced the new. In those days, most of the musicians were really from the Anglo Indian Catholic Christian community because they were the ones who were more trained in English. The Jets was really the first beat band, it wasn't so much rock music, but it was known as beat music. And the word beat was not far from Beatle. We started to model our lives along the lines of what The Beatles were doing at the time. The musicians those days were more into singing Jim Reeves, Everly Brothers, Pat Boone, and then bang came The Beatles. And it was like an electric breath of fresh air. Whatever we were used to suddenly lost its relevance. One day we just woke up and we saw an image of the great Shammi Kapoor with that Beatle wig in a Hindi film. That spoke about the enormous power and the clout of The Beatles. My mother was a Indian classical musician. And then she bought me my first 45, which was, "I Wanna Hold Your Hand." Straight away and she bought me a British pop magazine where I could read about what was happening in the UK and the UK pop scene. One day one of my classmates came back to India after the holidays, and he brought an album by The Beatles, who we'd never heard of. By 10 o'clock that night, I'd fallen in love with the music, that I'd heard it three or four times, that music grew into me and I thought, "Wow, this is fabulous." We used to play those records again and again and again, you know, somebody listening to the words, you know, somebody who's trying to figure out the chords- - Yes, the solo. - And the solos, and the most difficult part were the harmonies. Beatles still remain one of the greatest, you know, harmony groups, you know, ever. We went to Calcutta, we stayed with a friend. And the first night he took us to a restaurant called Trinkers. But when we walked in, we were dressed in our Beatle clothes, and everybody got up and started clapping. I don't know why, maybe they assumed we were some famous group but we weren't, but the owner of the restaurant said, "Hey, you know, the people wanna know if you guys sing?" I said, "Yeah, we sing." He said, "Would you do a couple of numbers?" So we did, "She Loves You" and "Please, Please Me." We brought the house down, shook our heads, et cetera, et cetera. The owner came and he said, "Would you guys like a residency?" And that's how our career started. We were the first Western music performing group to be ever recorded in India. At the HMV studios, and a song which, of I'm not mistaken, there was a song called "Pain" and "The Girl Next Door." I think "The Girl Next Door" had some influences of The Beatles. Especially the harmonies. - Especially the harmonies. - The harmonies, yes, yes. I was planning to go west because, you know, forget the Indian culture, the Western culture was what we youngsters wanted. By some strange paradox, The Beatles, who lived in the culture I wanted, were making their way to India. LSD was really beginning to make its mark in London, in the the circles that they moved in. Some newspaperman came up and he said, "Have you had LSD?" So I thought, well, I'll either be cagey here or I'll be honest, so I said, yes. Oh God, well, I mean, the first time was when George and Me, John and Cynthia were invited for dinner by our dentist. And that was a bit scary, because, you know, what was happening to us. Do you know what I mean? It's just, everything is surreal. And you look at your hand and you're like 500 years old. And then I'd hear my voice and wonder where it came from. And colours, and there's an intensity to it. When we took the notorious wonder, drug LSD, we had it and we went out to a club and it was incredible. When I got onto acid, right, you know the day that you're at a hundred percent potential and you can handle whatever the situation is, with acid, or just after acid, the percent of good days as opposed to bad days was just a bit better, you know. They particularly got into drugs and Indian music at the same time, and it seemed like there was some kind of a connection between the two, there wasn't of course, because they both preexisted separately. There must be an intimate connection between Indian music and drugs, maybe because of the bizarre sound, and there should be a drug connection he said that- Just watch who you're calling bizarre, Dick. Yes, I have difficulty with the word bizarre. I meant B-A-Z-A-A-R, the other... No, wait a minute, there's no way I can get out of this. To Western ears, the unusual sound might suggest some sort of chemical intoxication. I'm not blaming George, but you know, somehow because of him, the sitar became really popular among the young people. The hippies were the ones who caught on to a new music, and it just happens that most of them were, you know, were smoking pot or something. And, since then, the two got caught up together but it's really a problem. Yeah, I requests to my listeners to be in a clear mind, because I like to put them, you know, - make them high with the music. - Yourself. Yes, and I feel rather cheated when they're already high. LSD opened them up to experiences and awarenesses of consciousness that they wouldn't have got in any other way. Eastern religion, I think, would have been opaque to them, they wouldn't have been able to understand it at all, but, having had that experience, suddenly these things made sense. George said that when he first took LSD, he heard voices in the back of his head saying yogis of the Himalayas. Maharishi, good evening. You once said even if only 1/10 of the adult population meditated for short periods each day, it would not take more than a few months to remove the entire accumulation of tension in the world. - These are your words? - I'm absolutely convinced about it. I saw an advertisement in the paper for transcendental meditation classes. So I went with a girlfriend. England I've been visiting once every year. People do feel stress and strain due to the greater undertaking in their life. Paul phoned George and said, "There's this man called Maharishi who's going to come to England and talk about meditation" And I said, "Oh, that's the same guy that, you know, I follow" So in those days, when one Beatle did something, they all did it, so we all went. Now you've been travelling the world now for many years. You've made, I think, something like eight world tours. Ninth, I returned this time. This was the ninth completed. Maharishi was the most powerful, magnetically charismatic person I've ever met. He was also the happiest person I ever met. He was filled with this energy that you wanted to be near him all the time. All of us who were on his staff, we fought each other to get into the room with him. It was just the right time, anyway, there we were waiting for someone- Waiting for a guru, - and he came. - The great magic man to come, and he came, you know. There he was, he's just talking about it all and he had great answers. 'Cause he's got that kind of thing, you know, and he got a twinkle in the eye. They told Maharishi that they'd been seeking a spiritual experience. They'd been trying to do it through drugs, but it just didn't work, you know? And so he invited them to come to Bangor, North Wales. Where he would be doing a meditation retreat for 10 days. The Beatles seem to be among your supporters now, how do you feel about that? They seem to be very intelligent and I'm honoured. And so you think that if The Beatles adopt your teaching, then they can spread it amongst other young people in England? And much more, not only England, but around the world. Because the word Beatle has gone on in all the continents, and younger people are fascinated by their name. What do you think of The Beatles? Very good, intelligent young boys, and there's great potential. And their music? Music I haven't heard, but because they are appreciated all over the world, they must have something very grateful in their music. I think he's trying to say is the things we're getting into aren't that important. Money has taken over from God. Instead of trying to get where God is, we all try and get the biggest bank balance. That's what it seems to mean. Peace of mind is like an ocean, very deep. And the activity's only on the surface like that. So if the waves of the ocean contact deeper level of water, then the wave becomes stronger. That means that we're going to be happier. And much happier and much more creative also. He was found in his second floor bedroom, just after two o'clock this afternoon by his housekeeper. Mr. Epstein has been unwell now for some months. And he's been in the habit of taking tablets to help him sleep at night. When Brian died, The Beatles clearly were lost. They were like jelly, their manager, their best friend, their man who they rely on totally for their fame, for their fortune, you know, their guide in life, was now gone. John, where would you be today without Mr. Epstein? I don't know. I understand that Mr. Epstein was to be initiated here? Mmm. When was he coming up? Was he coming up in the afternoon? Coming tomorrow. Just Monday, that's all we knew. I spoke to him Wednesday evening, then evening before we first saw Maharishi's lecture and he was in great spirits. I wanted Maharishi to bring him back to life again. You know, I, by this time, I'm giving him so much power and how extraordinary that they were with Maharishi, who's now going to be, sort of, their spiritual guru, but also that they could lean on him, because they trusted him so much. So, for that moment in time, he replaced Brian. I understand that the Maharishi conferred with you all? He told us not to get overwhelmed by grief, and whatever thoughts we have of Brian, to keep 'em happy, because any thoughts we have of him will travel to him, wherever he is. I come to India because of I want to leave material world. Come to a simple country. Ganga is a holy river because it comes from Himalayas and this place has much energy. And it come down, no? Takes energy and comes here. The ashrams or monasteries of the various religious orders glimmer over the smooth green water. Though the sun is hot, the river is icy, flowing from a glacier high up in the Himalayas, the land of the Gods. But Rishikesh, its name means place of the wise ones, is far from being a remote or desert region. Its one of the most celebrated centres of pilgrimage in the whole of India. In the cool clear air of Rishikesh, North India, the meditation retreat of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Flower-loving yogi told reporters that his brand of peace of mind could only be truly appreciated by intelligent men of the world with rewarding activities and high incomes. The purpose of life is the expansion of happiness. Anyone can find the way. That's the basic teaching of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Are The Beatles really going to find happiness here in Rishikesh? Are they really going to become, as Maharishi hopes, the practical philosophers of the age? Or must they return home unsatisfied? Eternal, rich, young men victims of a fad, looking for something, anything, to make their lives worth while. I was a reporter. I'd heard that the best thing that a reporter can do is to beat all the other reporters in getting to the news. A friend of mine read that The Beatles were coming to stay with the Maharishi. And he said, "Saeed, do you know what it means? The whole world and its media is going to be here." The idea is to beat them. How do you beat them? "Ah," I said, "the idea is to become a disciple. If I become an insider, I'll get the story." So I walked in, you had to make some excuse if you're a drug addict, if you had failed, if you are a junkie, he whispered a mantra, a chant, in my ear, Which I'm not supposed to share with anybody. Then I went in, and again, and again, until all the sadhus who were going to be his managers recognise me. The password was jaguar will live, you said jaguar will live then you were in. From Hardwar, to Rishikesh, across Lakshman Jhula. I was taking aback. It was like a locust storm. Journalist, after journalist, after journalist, hundreds of them, "What's going on? They're not letting us in." I said, "They're not letting anybody in." Overnight, I went off to Rishikesh, with quite a few people from all over India. And it was very difficult to even know where The Beatles, where the ashram was, because it was so fortified. Fortified in the sense that, you know, there are a lot of police, there was a lot of bundobust in there. The whole day, we would just, early morning, wake up, somebody said, "Hey, The Beatles are coming to the Ganga." And so we'd all rush up there and wait there for two, three hours, but nothing would happen, you know. But it was like a celebration, it was like an exhibition, 'cause, you know, there was so much of joy. One day, Maharishi called me in and he said, "The Beatles are gonna be arriving in a few days, but I want you to go fix up their rooms." They put me in charge to make their rooms nicer. I would have them paint this, they'd drop so much paint on the floor, then they'd have to paint the floor. Anyway, we had curtains put up. We had mirrors, we even had toilet fixtures that worked. They have mattresses on their beds. There's a fan club of real beetles waiting to welcome them, but the hardest thing about the life they lead here are the beds they'll sleep on. A hard wooden base, a simple, rather than a spartan existence. When they did arrive he introduced them to me and said to them, "If you want to anything, get a hold of Nancy. Nancy will be my ears and eyes in case you need anything, you let me know through her." So I found my way and I went to the gate and I said, "Jaguar will live." "Ah," they said. Oh, there was a hell of commotion outside. "How did this bastard get in?" I said, "I'm just a devotee of the Maharishi" So anyway, I entered and there under the tree, Maharishi, George, John Lennon, Paul, their respective ladies, a whole galaxy. I mean, I can't keep describing them. I need a photograph. So I called the sadhus. I said, "Look, I'm having difficulty managing this on my own, I immediately assumed the role of publicity manager for the Maharishi." So I said, "Here's a name, Raghu Rai. You go outside, call him in. This man came, who was from the ashram, and he says, "Mr. Naqvi wants to see you." I said, "Give me two minutes." So I went in, I put a big zoom lens on my camera and put it inside my labaada. So when I'm walking nobody can see if I'm carrying a camera. So I walked with him for about eight, 10 minutes. One sadhu was standing there. So he was standing next to him, so Saeed said, "Look there." I was shocked. Then I turned around and I saw that guy sadhu standing next to us. And I said. So he goes to get a glass of water for me, and Saeed says, "Hurry up, hurry up." In those days, we didn't have auto focus, auto exposure cameras, so you had to set the focus set and the exposure, everything. And I take just one picture, nicely focused and proper. Under the tree, Maharishi Yogi and The Beatles. See this building, this is the building where they lived. This room, I'll show you this side, this is the room of John Lennon. John Lennon stayed here. Other Beatles were staying in these rooms, along with their wives and family. So when Beatles came, I was a little kid. We were enjoying the whole atmosphere and the jungles and Beatles and the Maharishi, we were very close. We never find he's a celebrity, or some big thing, we should not go near him. So this was the place where Maharishi used to converse with Beatles and guests. Straight we can see River Ganga, clear water and forest. There was a raised platform, rectangular shape. It was used for posing with the visitors and Beatles for the group photographs. Maharishi's disciples can wander in peace amongst the trees and bungalows, or meditate in some quiet spot overlooking the Ganges. He doesn't require you to give anything up except drugs and a week's salary, in The Beatles case around 11,000 pounds a piece. What exactly have you been doing, how do you meditate? You sit down, you relax, and then you repeat a sound to yourself, and it sounds daft, but it's just a system of relaxation and that's all it is, and there's nothing more to it. By expanding the conscious capacity of the mind, mental capacity will be stronger, thought power will be great, and when the thought power great, then the thought will find their fulfilment more easily. You go into do those interstellar spaces, where the spaces ultimately shrink into your being. Now, this gibberish goes on and on and on relentlessly, and you have these people close their eyes. And the more unintelligible it gets, the more profoundly affected they pretend to be. Because, I can't really imagine anyone being moved by words which are patently and absolutely absurd. His lectures were in the nature of this kind of arcane nonsense. Nothing succeeds like success, and it succeeded. Are you a business man? I don't deal with money directly, but I'm conducting the movement in 50 countries. I can't be said to be no businessman, even though I'm not dealing with money. I was a young girl, 21 or 22, so there I was in this beautiful ashram, I was taken to meet the Maharishi. He asked me to come close to him, I did, too close in fact. He said, I'm going to whisper something in your ear, the mantra, then he said, "I want you to go down into my prayer room, and I want you to concentrate upon that mantra You're going to feel like a new person." And I actually believed that this was going to happen to me. It was a dark room and there was some incense burning and there was some things hanging on the wall. And I started repeating the mantra. I repeated it, and the only feeling that I remember there was this intense desire to escape from that place. I went near the Maharishi and he said, "How do you feel my daughter? Do you feel like a different person?" I said, "Actually I don't." He looked at me and he said, "I going to whisper another mantra." "Back you go, repeat that mantra. You might have to spend a little longer." By now, I was in control. I repeated the mantra, and within half an hour I came upstairs. I gave him a glorious account of how I felt like a totally new human being. I felt like a different person all together. That was the only way to escape. And I walked out into freedom. Maharishi really influenced The Beatles songs and lyrics tremendously, starting with "Across The Universe" which is written right after The Beatles learned meditation. In that song, it says "jai guru deva," and Maharishi used to use that expression all the time. Now once more. It is in praise of the guru. So John Lennon put that into the song, jai guru deva. And then he said, "om," and om is the primordial sound that underlies and gives rise to the universe. Just the exposure to mantras, I mean, the idea was a repetitious sound could create an altered state of consciousness and you get it in, "Hello, Goodbye," you get in goo goo g'joob. Repetitious sounds creeping into their songs, whether deliberately or not. I lived for three days in a cottage at a camp in Rishikesh, just a hundred yards from The Beatles. I remember sitting around a bonfire at night with The Beatles, and Mike Love of The Beach Boys, And Donovan, and others singing and playing the guitar. It was a cold, cold evening, and at some point I muttered to the person next to me, "I'm freezing." A man seated just ahead of me, wrapped in a huge brown grey blanket heard me. He said, "Move up, love, come and share my blanket with me." It was George Harrison. I should have said yes, but by then I had successfully cultivated an air of nonchalance and looked at George like he was a nobody and replied, "No, thanks, George, I'm fine." Four regrettable words that I could never take back, and that have haunted me all my life for what could have been, but never was. The person who was actually sincere about meditation, about Indian culture, Indian music was George Harrison. Maharishi said of all The Beatles, George is the most advanced, and this is his last life. George wanted to understand why he was chosen to be famous. He found curious that he, a boy from Liverpool who otherwise would have had a very menial job, was selected and was famous. And he wants to know the answer. Really the only reason to be living is to have complete full knowledge, full bliss consciousness. Everything else is just mundane and secondary. The purpose is to transcend from this relative state of consciousness to an absolute state of consciousness. Maharishi said, John Lennon has many more lives to go, and he must not give into his weakness for women, or it will ruin him. Keeping company with himself, it could be part of the treatment, John stalked along the shady paths. John Lennon when he first arrived, he was grey, he'd been heavily into drugs, he just looked awful. And then little by little, you saw the change that came over this man, he had pink cheeks, he started to be very sociable, he was out playing his guitar, chatting with other people, and he was having such a lovely time. Meditation worked all right, you know, you can handle each day better than I could handle it before. I was mediating 8 hours a day and things like that. And it was really some trip, like acid was nowhere. Just sitting there just muttering some word in a room, that's the biggest trip I've ever had in life. Ringo is always in meditation, and he goes by feeling and heart. Whereas the other Beatles too much brain is in the way. Ringo enjoyed a peace of togetherness with Mrs. Ringo, it was a very peaceful scene. Ringo Starr, two or three days, he sees all this and he declares, "It's like a Butlin holiday camp," and disappears, he left. And then there were three. Ringo and his wife, Maureen, stayed at the ashram for 10 days. Ringo's allergies cause problems with the ashram food. He was allergic to so many things that he took two suitcases to India. One had his clothes and the other one was stuffed with cans of Heinz beans. But the primary reason that Ringo and Maureen left is because they missed their kids. Maharishi, I thank him, you know, all the time I thank him for giving me what it gave me. So I'm glad I've got it in case I ever wanna go into it again, you know, you can't lose, if you learn something. Maharishi wanted to take them off on a trip to the Himalayas. A company, Ganja's Helicopter Services. I'd always wanted to become a pilot. I became the chief pilot for the Maharishi. And I flew everybody, including the prime minister, and Mahatma Gandhi also, and The Beatles. Paul kept on saying, "Me, me, me," because he wanted to get in. And John said, "No, me, me, me." And anyway, finally, John just pushed him aside and went in. I'm flying John on my left and the Maharishi on my right. And the Maharishi lent across me, as you know, he had a lot of hair and beard, it was difficult for me to fly the helicopter. He was telling John down there in the mountains, people lived there, they never went down to the valleys, and they're praying all the time. So John said, "What are they're praying for?" So the Maharishi said "They are praying that we crash." And John said, "Goodness, why do they want us to crash?" They said, "Well, they're on the mountaintop with hardly any food. And I'm in Rishikesh with all the celebrities there, and all the money in the world." So John said, "Maharishi, if you don't move your head and hair their prayers will be answered." And of course, I started laughing and everybody did. He had a sense of humour. They were visiting Dehradun, George, John, and Paul. He said this Saturday, they're having celebration in the ashram to celebrate the birth of George Harrison wife. If I could could bring some other musicians along with me, they'll be very happy. So I said, I told them, "Okay, I can arrange it." So we all sat down, Maharishi gave us a lecture, and then I was asked to play. There was a composition with George Harrison, "With In, Without You," which was based on Dhrag Jhug, so I decided to play that. And then George was excited about it. And I smiled at him, he smiled and he waved at me. At that time, Nick sang with me, and Nick was just a visiting teacher. Now tell me where did that famous photo of us? Was it in the middle or was it over here? Here? Okay. - In this area, in this wall. - Okay. I have such vivid memories of that birthday party where so much music was played, so much glamour. Pattie Harrison there in her mauve sari. Part of our mission was to bring her George Harrison's birthday present to her, the dilruba. It was so relaxed coming from Britain. The Beatles were impossible to see or touch or reach, and here it was a completely different atmosphere. They were absolutely natural, all the musicians there. I think I spoke to Donovan, Mike Love, Paul Horn, and of course, Paul McCartney, Jane Asher, John Lennon, I don't think I spoke to George Harrison because he was so tied up in both the occasion of his wife's birthday and also the music. He really was playing music and enjoying music and absorbing Indian music. There was no pretence about it. He was completely hooked. The music started off being very Indian and played on Indian instruments, but then you could say it deteriorated into a birthday party with the "Happy Birthday" song, and the British national anthem for some curious reason. As the evening went on and perhaps people got a bit fidgety, we went outside and enjoyed fireworks. Of course, I went away feeling that perhaps the meditation was all a bit of a lark, because they enjoyed themselves so much in the evening. George Harrison was thinking mostly of playing better, serious music, which belonged to the world. But John Lennon was a serious human being. He was not very talkative, but he's thinking was very beautiful. So I was slightly more fascinated by John. I think they gave me so much respect, you know. They treated me very well, they called me, sir. And I was feeling strange, you know. I told them, "Don't call me, sir, no no no." They could not have seen me at all, there was no need for what they did. Success had not gone to the head, you know. They were simple human beings. We came up the path here, we were killing time and The Beatles meantime had come back to their bungalow and they were on the roof, not just The Beatles, but many of the musicians were on the roof of the bungalow playing music. And it's the most memorable thing of my day here, was hearing this music, which was of course unrecorded music, it was just being created at that time. And we felt we were in the, you know, witnessing the first time round, the first version of this music. The word was coming to the Maharishi that they had suspended their meditations and that they were sitting and composing music and things. We were there for about six weeks, and during that time was no pressure from the outside world. There was no pressure of them being Beatles, and their creative juices just overflowed. They wrote all the songs from "The White Album." They worked out gradually what they wanted us to do for the rest of their time as Beatles. Other than when they're we in the studio, they didn't get to spend a lot of time together So in India, they were suddenly together like sort of mates again. So they could sit out and play in the way that John and Paul used to play in the council house where Paul had grown up. And you've got Mike Love from The Beach Boys is there so they've got that whole tributary of American music that had influenced them, and Donovan with this kind of folk tradition and Paul Horn, who was a jazz flautist, he was there too, so you've got a lot of interesting, sort of, streams coming in. I'll show you the stairs here. They'd sit here on these stairs. There here was bamboo structure here, as a fence, those days. They'd come and they'd make new song there, staying here, sitting on the stairs. And that side, Prudence were living, Maharishi told her to be inside, stay with their practises. Mia Farrow's sister Prudence way ahead of anybody else. As soon as she entered her thing, she went into meditation and she has not emerged, it's already 24 hours. So she's serious. They would invite her outside. "Hello, Prudence, come out, come out, Prudence." And she won't come. And then they made a song, "Dear Prudence." I think one that's kind of interesting is when I came back from a tiger hunt with my eldest son, when we came walking in, he said to Maharishi, "I shot a tiger today, is that bad karma?" Sitting there observing this was John Lennon, and John said, "Don't you call that slightly life destructive?" And I said, "It was the tiger or us." Maharishi glared at Nancy the whole time they were talking about it. Life destruction is life destruction, end of story. That's how the song, "The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill" originated. It was John's answer to Nancy's paltry excuse. Because Mike Love was there and they knew The Beach Boys music, it was this kind of friendly rivalry of them wanting to top each other. But "Back in the U.S.S.R." Is just like a parody of a Beach Boys song, but instead of being about the USA, it's about Russia, and it was a very novel idea at the time to think of a rock and roll song that appeared to be celebrating Russian culture and had all these Russian names and Russian places being mentioned. Opposition members today demanded in inquiry into Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Alleging that Rishikesh have become a centre of conspirage. The issue was raised by Mr. K. Anirudhan after a radio transmitter was found on a bus near the antibiotics factory in Rishikesh belonging to a foreigner. The furor broke out in parliament. It was led by the communist, backed by the socialists, and they said that there was a CIA camp in the ashram, and the Maharishi were getting all these foreigners, including The Beatles, to destabilise India. I give the CIA total credit for sponsoring and initiating the entire consciousness movement, counterculture events of the 1960s. This was exactly the time when Indira Gandhi was making friends with the Soviet Union. Today we're going to show you a cases of attempted espionage by agents of the Sino-Soviet Intelligence System. If you recognise the way a Sino or Soviet agent operates, both in finding someone vulnerable to subversion, as well as in their technique of ensnaring him and applying pressure to get him to play ball. The KGB sent their top man in India, Bezmenov, to the ashram to check out the Maharishi. My function was to discover what kind of people attend this school. Yes, there are some influential opinion makers who come back with the crazy stories about Indian philosophy. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a great spiritual leader, or maybe a great charlatan and crook, depending from which side you're looking at him. Beatles were trained at his ashram, Mia Farrow, and other useful idiots from Hollywood visited his school, and they returned back to the United States, absolutely zonked out of their minds with marijuana, hashish and crazy ideas of meditation. Maharishi used to always say, "You can never create peace through signing treaties, through legislation, through any kind of external means. The only way to create world peace is for people to meditate." See, if you carefully look at what Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is teaching, is that most of the problems, most of the burning issues of today, can be solved simply by meditating. Don't rock the boat, don't get involved, just sit down, look at your navel and meditate, and things, due to some strange logic, due to cosmic vibration will settle down by themselves. The single aim of spiritually regenerating every man everywhere in the world, and creating peace. You can get control of yourself just by sitting quietly, and by turning off from the external problems we have, and all this society, you can go inside yourself where it's always calm and peaceful. This is exactly what the KGB and Marxist Lenin's propaganda want, to distract their attention and mental energy from real issues into non-issues, into non-existent harmony. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi obviously is not on the payroll of the KGB, but whether he knows it or not, he contributes greatly to demoralisation of American society. Paul McCartney and his girlfriend, Jane Asher, stayed for five weeks and they left because Jane had a theatrical commitment back in London. This presumably is your first big meditation, and what effect has it had on you? I think it calms you down. It's hard to tell because it was so different life out there. It'd be easy to tell now that I'm back and we're doing some ordinary thing to see just what it does. They were four working class guys from Liverpool. They had an innate sense of not being taken advantage of. So when they get together with Maharishi, Maharishi is inevitably tempted to capitalise on his sudden worldwide fame because of The Beatles association. They realise that maybe Maharishi had been using them all along for publicity, ever since the final record, that was "by The Beatles Spiritual Teacher," it said on the album. So John and George started a think something fishy is here. He's using us for publicity. So they began to hear little bits of news here and there, from the grapevine of, you know, your Maharishi's planning this and planning that, and you're gonna be in it and they're going, "Are we?" Maharishi kept promising ABC that he would do a special with The Beatles. And The Beatles kept saying, "We're not gonna do this special," but Maharishi kept promising it over and over. There comes a time in late '67, when Paul and George go to Sweden, basically to tell the Maharishi to cool a bit, you know. "Don't start making plans that involve us without telling us first." We're glad to have you here. - Thank you. - Thank you. We do appreciate your music and... That's a posy, yes? The smell of the flowers. We only decided to come yesterday, just to pop over to have a little chat. Yes, yes. And when The Beatles were in Rishikesh, he, without their knowledge was having the discussions with a Hollywood film company called Four Star International. Maharishi promised them that they could have exclusive rights to make a film about Maharishi and about Maharishi's guru. But unfortunately, Maharishi made the same promise to someone else. He had given rights to Four Star Productions. The lawyer arrived in Rishikesh with a signed contract. They gave exclusive rights to film Maharishi for the next five years. Some suits arrive from Hollywood and a crew, and John and George were going, "We didn't want this, you know we are here to meditate, we don't want these film people here." And there was a confrontation with Maharishi about, "Why you're doing this, we told you not to" In any case, The Beatles became quite disillusioned about that. The film was really kind of a deal breaker, and they got very angry because they had been granted exclusive rights to do this film, and now another film company is there. So the whole thing just fell apart. I don't know what happened, I still don't know. But I know there many rumours around, but John said, "That's it we're, we're going, were going." But I know John wants to come back to England and see Yoko, and so any little excuse and John was ready to go, 'cause we'd been there for weeks. Well, it was only John who was upset. John dragged George along. And I still think it was when Magic Alex came from the Apple Corps group. Alexis Margas was one of The Beatles associates. In fact, he was very close to John, and sort of attached himself to John's hip, and Cynthia really didn't like Alexis. She was very concerned about this Svengali influence that he was having on John. John had introduced Alex as, "My new guru." He was this electronics marvel. Supposedly, he introduced himself as somebody who is like Edison and Marconi combined, but in fact, he was just a TV repairman. He's just a friend of ours who's in electronics. Oh yeah. He's called Alex, and he's great, he's a Greek fella. -And he's invented things- -You know he's Greek. He's invented incredible things. He was a minx, yeah, naughty, little boy. You see, he wanted to have power over John, so he would, you know, create all these things, pretending he's a scientist. He said, "Oh, here's this one from new wallpaper, but it's all speakers, so the whole room will have this one big speaker." So he loved all that, controlling John. So clearly and obviously Maharishi was in the way. One night, John and Maharishi were having this wonderful rapport, and I, you know how you can see sometimes when a person let's the mask drop from their face, and I could see this really dislike of Maharishi on Magic Alex's face. It disturbed me and I felt something was going wrong. No one ever saw him meditating. And as a matter of fact, he admitted that he came to India for the purpose of getting The Beatles away from Maharishi. Alexis said, "Oh, it's because we don't want Maharishi to have that much influence over the boys." I'm totally convinced that Magic Alex made a friend of one of the young women at the ashram, and he got her to tell John Lennon that she was having sex with Maharishi. Is this just horrified all of us when this whole thing happened. I believe that Maharishi made a pass. And the reason I believe it is because he made a pass at many women that I knew. Wasn't the first or the last one. Well I remember Maharishi saying that, you know, "If you haven't an ugly woman over here, and a beautiful woman over there, it's just easier for your attention to go to the more beautiful." John and George didn't believe it at first, but finally Alexis convinced them and then went and got taxis for all of them before they could change their mind. While they were waiting for the taxis, John wrote, "Maharishi, Maharishi, what have you done? You made a fool of everyone." The song had a lot of expletives in it, and George said, "You can't say that, that's ridiculous" So John changed the lyrics to "Sexy Sadie." Yeah, "Sexy Sadie," it was actually called "Maharishi." And it was a put down in the Maharishi in very vicious terms. I don't think the chance of it getting out with the words that John had originally, but basically denounces him and says he was a bit of a rogue. John dragged George along and then he just bolted from the ashram. I think Maharishi was a mistake. What do you mean he was a mistake? We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was, you know, but he's human, and for a while we thought he wasn't, you know, thought he was a. The Beatles, they were opening us up to different experiences in various ways, you know. Indian philosophy and Indian music. And then when they went to Rishikesh, you know, it was the idea of Indian travel. It's like, "Wow, looks nice over there, you know, they're enjoying themselves in the sunshine." There'd been a hippie trail, an embryonic hippie trail, in the early sixties, a few people had gone out. The whole point being that you drove over land, the ultimate destination was in fact Katmandu in Nepal. I'm sure The Beatles inspired lots of people to go, because this little trickle of people on the hippie trail beforehand suddenly turned into a flood. Did you enjoy the trip over to India? Yes, The journey was terrible, but the trip was all right. There was a report that we get -we got a very bad report- -Yeah its true, we smashed him. You didn't like him, or you didn't have the patience and decided to go home. We were there four month so, George and I were. Did you think this man was on the level? I don't know what level he's on, but we had a nice holiday in India and came back and rested. Maharishi looked visibly frail and without his usual effervescence. His brilliant and beautiful yogic radiance was reduced to grey and to ashen. He became physically sick when the chorus moved from Rishikesh to Kashmir. He's still a nice fella, and everybody's fine, but we don't go out with him anymore. When the Rishikesh experience finished, Paul, John and Ringo just kind of carried on, resumed with their lives, but for George, India was never a five minute thing. India was a lifetime devotion. And he wasn't just gonna give it up because of the way that Rishikesh finished with a bit of a sour taste. India for him was something that he continued to push. George didn't want to go back to London. George was still in meditation mode, and he didn't want to go straight back to see the press. So he said, "Let's go down to Kerala, just for a week." And it was very calm then, and then, you know, he wanted to slowly come back into the business life, as it were, in London, slowly, in his way. I mean, because everybody, all of a sudden became an individual. John, Paul, Ringo and George. The Maharishi phase faded out, you know, but the Indian aesthetics and the etiquettes remained with everybody. Using the influence of Indian music and the culture. You know, when you look back at The Beatles story on their return to the UK in the spring of 1968, there was still the comradery that saw them through the madness of Beatlemania. Soon to dissolve as the fraught sessions of "The White Album" began. Working separately most of the time and not as a unit, and with Ringo quitting the band for a short period, remarkably, they delivered what many would call one of their greatest albums. When The Beatles were in India, Maharishi told them, if they don't continue meditating regularly their band would break up. Now, does this mean a business or emotional split within The Beatles? I should think a bit of both. It's probably to do with growing up and to do with there was a time when there were just four of them but now they're married and there are children. I was born in 1971. Same time around when Beatles broke up. I mean, even like, I guess it's about 50 odd years or something, it still sounds fresh. It sounds amazing. The world would have been like, so shit without them, you know? The world is so much better to live in with that music around. The songs that they made in India, in Rishikesh, I had no idea and out of them some of the songs like "Blackbird," like "Dear Prudence," like these are some of the songs that I used to perform in my old band in Chennai. To have known that they have written these songs in India, it just gave it so much more meaning because I used to connect to these songs as a classical musician, more than a person who loves English music. I was born in '74, so for me to get to know The Beatles happened much later. We were not really born at the time when the dressing, how a Beatles haircut or the dress that they wore really attracted us, I mean, we didn't see that. We only heard the music. It's purely the music. It sounded very simple, very catchy, and you could, you know, have a high recall. So whenever you heard a song, you would remember it. But when you sat down to work on it, to try and see if you can sing that song, that is when you realise the complexity of it. I don't know how it was appreciated when it was released, but it's something that is still relevant today. They came to see, in the fullness of time, in particular, in George's case, George discovered from gathering evidence what exactly happened at the end of their stay in Rishikesh, and how Alexis Margas, Magic Alex had cooked up this whole thing. George always loved Maharishi, and toward the end of his life he went back to see Maharishi. George said to Maharishi, "I came to apologise" and Maharishi asked "For what?" And George replied, "You know, for what." Maharishi apparently said to George, he believed that The Beatles were angels on earth and that they were not guilty of any crime themselves. So when George came away from that meeting, he felt cleansed of his guilt of the method of their departure back in 1968. I got into India, I think that was the one thing in my life that I could have done without everything else, but that one thing of getting in touch with what's inside through Maharishi and Ravi Shankar and indie music. And as for the others, well they all warmed again to the culture and the spirituality of India. The only way we can change the system is by changing it non-violently, because they've done the violent for millions of years. I think the only way to do it is Gandhi's way, and that's nonviolent, passive, positive, or whatever they call it these days. John Lennon spoke kindly of Maharishi in other interviews. Ringo and Paul have both said the same, everything became okay again, in the end. Years ago, we studied meditation with the Maharishi. He was one of the ones that wasn't a fake. There were a lot of them around that time who were into Rolls Royces and chicks. He wasn't one of them. I actually met him quite recently. He lives in the Netherlands now, and I took Stella, my daughter and James, my son with me. And he is a spry old codger, he in his eighties and he's still working, he's still going. The day when Maharishi died, there was a big storm. The water from the river Ganges came whirling up and it showered in this area. The local folks who came here to pay their tributes to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi were amazed to see this supernatural thing. It was a power of Maharishi which brought Gunga on this top of mountain. When I first came here 10 years ago, this was just jungle, ruins and jungle. And we would sneak in through the back, there were cracks in the wall, and you would smoke pot and see leopards at night. This is what people did. So I take tourists into the ashram, I show them everything, and I'm trying to bring them back into 1968 and give them some of the experience of The Beatles here. Tourists that come here, they really appreciate it. They really appreciate to have the sense for The Beatles as a historical entity. My experience when I went to The Beatles ashram was super magical. These huge superstars, you wouldn't really think that they'd go to a really simple, no-frills ashram in Rishikesh. The most exciting thing about music is the way that it has the capacity to shift cultural norms and expand people's minds, and in India, that's exactly what The Beatles did by bridging the gap between East and West in a country that was very much under this, you know, dark cloud of colonial rule. Which in many ways created a culture of apology for being Indian and a reverence for whatever was foreign. That what was so powerful is for the most powerful band in the world to come and revere our culture. They had descended in our part of the country, and they had embraced the spiritual narrative of India, and they had come to Rishikesh, and there were images of them with Mahesh Yogi and then suddenly we look, they are one of us. As kids, as Indian kids, you know, we're always rebelling against our culture. And then you realise that like something that is so influential in pop culture, took a lot of influence from India. My introduction to them was I happened to be part of the age of illegal downloading, at the time of like Napster and stuff. We used to have "The White Album" on CD. That was my first introduction to The Beatles. We still felt it's influence even though we were born like in the eighties and nineties. India is considered this place where you could go for a spiritual awakening, for meditation, so I think The Beatles came to India to look for that. And in some ways they really did find that. I guess that's a small gift that India gave the world through The Beatles. The happiest time in life, one of the happiest times was in India. I mean, it was just such a groove. And it was such a pure thing, everything is slightly more in perspective. The whole of life should be a spiritual experience because we are spirits who are just encased in bodies. People forget that and think they're just this body, but we're actually spirits in bodies.
