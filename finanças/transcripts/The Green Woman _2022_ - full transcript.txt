[MUSIC PLAYING] [CHILDREN LAUGHING] (SINGING) Have you seen my place? I have misplaced my spot. I'll just check with myself, and we'll get along fine. It's fine by me. What works for you, works for me too, doesn't it? Have you seen my date? I left them here last week with a bunch of things to say when I was too tired to... [PARKING BREAK CLICKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Listen little lamb... I think everything's going to be OK. It's going to be all right. People just need... [DOOR CLOSING] You wouldn't believe the day I've had today. Is this all the mail there is, Rommy? What's there is there. Rommy, is this all the mail there is? What's there is there. Are you sure this is all the mail? No, I am hiding all the mail as part of an evil conspiracy against all bureaucrats. It's there. It's nice. It's very nice. Hey, listen, did you bother to do any work today or did you just sit around in your PJs? Not like it's my duty to support you, Rommy. What would be the point of supporting someone when I make enough money here to support myself, huh? You know, Lloyd says writing is a dying industry. Hey says maybe you should get a job in marketing. You could write for them. Does he now? Fuck, Rommy, he's just trying to help. Well, you know what? I've just spent a whole day doing paid work. So I didn't know I needed any help. Get off my case, please. You're pathetic. Ugh. Rommy, if you grew up, you'd see you need help. I have grown up. For fuck's sake. Goddammit, you're impossible to work with! I swear to God. If you're going to be like this as soon as I get home from work, I will go out. Good, leave. That's exactly what you want. [DOOR CREAKING] Rommy, keep drinking. [MUSIC PLAYING] Good evening, Romulus. How are you this evening? Jesus, Sergeant. Don't do that. Are you saying that I can still command a certain amount of fear from the general public? Good thinking, buddy, but you don't. And don't call me Romulus either. I like... I'd like it if you called me Rommy. And I've told you don't call me buddy. It's Fischer. How was your day today? What can I do for you, Fischer? Rommy, I came by to see how you were going, if you're OK or if you need anything. I'm just a little bit confused because you keep coming around here every few weeks, and I don't know why. Look, I am just checking to see how you were handling things. Life can be pretty hard at times, and it's good to have a friend you can chat to. Well, I'm fine. Thanks. Are you sure? Quite I noticed you've lost quite a bit of weight over the last year. Are you eating? Yes. Yes, I have. You know, you really ought to get someone in to look at that garden. It's looking a little out of control. I'll keep it in mind. Call me if you need me. I'm here for you. Thank you. Just look after yourself, Rommy. Will do. [MUSIC PLAYING] Rommy, what was that Sergeant Fishy doing here? His name is Fischer. Oh, whatever. You still didn't tell me why he was here. What have you done this time? What makes you think I've done anything? I don't think you've noticed, but I don't do anything but work all day here. Oh, is that what you call it? You know, Rom, he's been coming around here a lot lately. Are you sure there's nothing you want to tell me? All right, you got me. I'm under investigation for plans of world domination. So to answer your stupid question, no, I haven't done anything. So please stop asking me these stupid questions. Then what was he doing here, Rom? Jesus, you never give up, do you? Why was he here, Rommy? To check up on me, if you really must know. Maybe once you cut out this writing bullshit and get a real goddamn job. [MIMICKING MARY SARCASTICALLY] I've got a real job, and I'm fucking good at it. So shut the fuck up. You're a deadbeat. Oh, that's a big word for a big girl. Deadbeat. Deadbeat. Deadbeat. Stop it! Oh, Look at me. I'm naked. [LAUGHS] You're pathetic. What? So I'm pathetic? Yes. Oh, and I'm the one who's pathetic. Thanks a lot. Christ, you're always so angry when you get home. [SIGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING AT THE DOOR] Hold on. Who is it? I said, who is it? Hello? Hello? [DOOR CREAKING] Hello? Hello? This is a very funny [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CLOSING] Ugh, pathetic. Hello? Hello? Are you going to get up soon, Mr. Big Shot Writer? Rommy, get up. [GROAN] How did you expect to feel, Rom? What are you trying to say? Well, maybe if you'd stopped with all this writing business, you could stop being such a drunken waste. Oh, man. Oh, that's not good. That's not good. [GLASS CLANKING] Well done. Just shut up, all right? Let me wake up. And that's another thing, were you banging on the door last night when you came home? What? Were you banging on that door over there when you came home last night? No, what the hell are you talking about? You reek. You stink. Don't worry about it. I won't. God, you're going to make me late for work, Rommy. Jeez, sorry. [SCOFFS] Rommy, do me a favor today. Don't work too hard. You're amazing, you know that? You have no idea how lucky I am to have someone like you in my life. Have a nice day. [DOOR CREAKING] Well, that went well. [MUSIC PLAYING] [COUGHING] Thank you. What? Have you never seen a green woman before? Well, don't look so surprised. It was you who always said that the universe is full of weird and wonderful things beyond your imagination. [LAUGHS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [ENGINE HUMMING] [PARKING BREAK CLICKING] [DOOR CREAKING] Hey. Hello? Oh, sorry. Hi. You OK there? Yeah, I've had one hell of a day, done a lot of work. That's great. Is it worth anything? I... I beg your pardon? Is it worth anything? No, I heard you. I'm just a little bit disappointed that you have no respect for what I do. You won't believe who I ran into at the gym today. Who is it? Sarah Martin. Sarah Martin. We used to live next door to her in our first flat. No, I can't remember. Yeah, she used to date that Asian guy. Um, what was his name? Ling? Ming? You mean Aaron Nguyen? Yeah. No, I don't because Ling and Ming sound nothing like Nguyen. Well, he left her, and now she's broke. Oh, that's got to suck. What do you expect me to do about it? Nothing. I was just going to suggest to Lloyd that we her. Apparently, she's got a great background in finance. Lloyd? Lloyd. Great. Apparently, he left her with a kid. He left her for another woman. I'm going to have a shower. I've got to go out tonight. You're going out? Can't we just stay in for once and just have dinner together? No, this is important. I've got a business meeting. I've got to go. Rommy, if you had a proper job, you'd understand, but you don't. I'm having a shower. But it's my birthday today. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mary? [LAUGHTER] Hello, stranger. OK, how do you keep getting into my house? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Do you promise? It's a fascinating story. What if Mary comes home? Don't you just love to feel a little naughty every now and again? It's just so delicious. All right. Can you at least tell me what your name is? All these questions, huh? Aren't you the curious thing? Do you remember though, curiosity kills the cat. Did it? Good thing I don't have a cat. Besides isn't it more fun this way? It's definitely different. All right. Well, maybe you could be so kind as to tell me why I have a green woman in my house at 3:30 in the morning? Now that's the million-dollar question, isn't it? Well, wouldn't you say? It's OK. Shh. See? You can feel our trust. Well, where is the other half anyway? What is her name again? M... Mary. M... Mary? Well where is Mary? Is she not going to say hi? I'm guessing she's at a meeting. She's probably at a business meeting. Oh, a business meeting. Is it normal for Mary to be at a business meeting at 3:30 in the morning, especially on your birthday? So you know it's my birthday? Oh, I know you far better than you could possibly believe. Is that because my mind created you? Possibly. Or am I real? [LAUGHS] Anyway, what did she get you? Well, she hasn't gotten me anything yet, but I'm sure she will. Aw, that doesn't seem fair. Did you get me anything? Aren't I enough? I'm not sure yet. Where are you going? You just got here. Are you... you leaving? Sorry, my dear, but I must. Will I see you again? [LAUGHTER] Wait. [DIGITAL TONES] Come on, pick up, pick up. Hello, please leave a message after the tone. [BEEP] Yeah, hi, Mary. It's me again. Look, I can't believe your phone's not on. Can you... when you get this message, can you please call me back? You went away three days ago, and I haven't heard from you. Just I'm a little worried. Please just call me back, OK? [DIGITAL TONE] [MUSIC PLAYING] What, no hello? Oh, Jesus Christ. Are you crazy? I am glad I still have that effect on you. You know how much trouble I'm going to get into for having a scantily dressed beautiful green woman in my house? Mary's going to kill me. Do you think I'm beautiful? Do you knock? I could have been in the middle of something. I'm sorry. Are you? Well, no, but I... Well, then no harm done. Besides think of me like the sea. I come and I go as I please. I see you're still holding my hand. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I... uh... Don't be. I didn't expect you to come back, that's all. I am glad you decided to take a chance on me. Who are you? Has anyone ever told you how cute you are when you're puzzled? Come on. Are you ever going to tell me who you are? I will in good time. Fine. Rommy, I know you've had problems with trust in the past, but trust me. Besides, can you honestly say I am like anyone you have ever met? Well, actually I have a dinner date tomorrow night with a purple woman. [LAUGHS] No, I've never met anyone like you before. Who are you? Where are you from? Oh, you always have had an insatiable sense of curiosity. I was told not to tell you yet. Yet? Now there it is. How the hell do you know that unless it's in my mind? All in good time, my dear Rommy. I do promise you the answer will be great entertainment. Well, then who told you not to tell me? Well, I could tell you that, but you're really not going like the answer. Tell me. OK, but you're not going to like it. [SIGHS] Just tell me. You did. I did? Mm-hmm. I would have done anything you asked of me. All right. Well, if I told you, then perhaps you can tell me why you're here? Now that's where it gets really interesting. I am here because you sent me. But what do you and I apparently want with me? Well, you didn't think I was going to come all this way for nothing, did you? Even though I do enjoy our visits. You do? Mm-hmm. But I do need you to do something for me. Like what? Oh, don't worry. It won't be too bad. That's not the assurance you think it is. [LAUGHS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] You need to answer that. Do I have to? Mm-hmm. Fine. Give me a second. [DIGITAL TONE] Hello? Rommy? Yes, Mel. What's up? How's the script going? What are you talking about? It's not due for another two weeks. I was expecting it in... [INTERPOSING VOICES] You haven't even paid me. OK, just... I've got to go, OK? Hurry. Yes, bye [DIGITAL TONE] Sorry about that. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Cry for you, baby. Yeah, I do. When I didn't think that I would. To love you, baby, like I have, I didn't know that I could let myself long for the touch of another so much. I thought I was independent, that's my sentiment. But apparently I'm not. Apparently I'm not. Because all I want to do is go home and get down with you tonight. Where have you been for the past three days? You didn't call. I thought you could have gotten in a car wreck or something, Mary. Rommy, what do you want for dinner? Are you going to tell me where you were? You didn't reply to any of my text messages. You know I was worried about you. I was at a meeting, Rommy. Oh, you were at a meeting, were you? Where you and your bureaucrat friends debating the meaning of life, that kind of meeting? Oh, hang on, a meeting that required you to wear the same fucking clothes for three days straight. What the fuck are you inferring, huh? It's you who's doing all the inferring in this house. Oh, really? Yes. Well, then what the fuck are you saying? Where were you? I told you. You were with Lloyd. You're just a delusional fuck up, Rommy. Yeah? You sit around all day drinking. That's my problem? It is. You fail every single day at everything you do. Really? Yeah. Besides, with a reaction like that, how do I know you're not seeing someone? You think I'm seeing someone? Yeah, who the fuck are you seeing? You know what? You're right. I am seeing someone. I'm seeing someone behind your back. I'm seeing a green woman behind your back. How does that make you feel, huh? Go fuck yourself. [BOTTLE CLANKS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Do you really need that? Don't you think you should be weeding instead of drinking? I don't really have time to do any gardening right now. I've got to do this. There's always an excuse with you. Yeah. [DIGITAL TONE] Oh, I just got a message. What? I got to go into the office. But it's your day off. I mean, how can they expect you to go in? I've got to go in. [SIGHS] Have to go in. [MUSIC PLAYING] You're quite nicely dressed up Thanks. Lloyd actually makes you wear that for a client? Yeah, Rommy. I need to look presentable. All right, I've got to head off. Mary? Hm? Are we going to do anything for my birthday this year? What? Are we going to do anything for my birthday this year, because you kind of went away for three days and you missed it. Rommy, it's just another day. Just another day. You weren't saying that last year when you made me uh... when you begged for me to organize a surprise party for you and a 30 of your friends. Do you remember that? Rommy, that was your choice. Choice. I'll make it up to you, OK? There's always next year. Mm-hmm. You never know your luck in the big city. [DOOR CLOSING] Mary's a bitch. Mary's a bitch. I'm so lonely. I know. (SINGING) All by myself. All by my... [LAUGHTER] Hello? Who's there? I said, who's there? [LAUGHTER] Hello, stranger. Miss me? Are you crazy? Mary just left. Oh, you are not happy to see me. Well, I can always go if you want me to. No, you can... you're here now just stay. It's fine. [LAUGHS] I knew you were going to say that. You did? Mm-hmm. I know you far better than you could possibly believe. Um, I'll come back. I think I'll... No... come back. Not at all. There's so much room in here. It could easily fit two or three people. Well, as much as I could lie here talking all day, I didn't just come here for a visit so that you could avoid looking at my body. Why is it when a man really likes a girl, he tries so desperately hard to avoid looking at her? I digress. I need you to do something for me. Well, don't just stand there. You look uncomfortable. Come and lie by me. What do you want me to do? What do I call you? I like the idea of being called the green woman. It sounds mysterious, enigmatic. [LAUGHS] OK, green woman. Uh, what would you like me to do for you, green woman? I know we've been enjoying all this fun. This is serious. I can be serious. [LAUGHS] I don't doubt it. I need you to get something for me. It's going to sound a little strange. Like what? I need you to procure several meters of copper wiring. That's what you call it in your time, right? My time? Yeah, I'll bet tomorrow it gets much more advanced. [CHUCKLES] And I need a satellite dish at least this wide. You actually need me to do this? Mm-hmm. And it must be done tonight. Where on Earth do you expect me to find a satellite dish and copper wiring tonight? Well, it doesn't matter where you get it from, but I need it to be untraceable. Where do I find it? Well, you're a resourceful person. You can do anything. You really think you've got the right person? I think you've got the wrong person. I'm sorry. I know you can do this, and I know you will do this for me. I don't... I don't usually leave the house. I'm sorry. I haven't been out of the house in a while, so. I know. And I know you're scared, but you can do this, me and you. You really need me to do it? Well, that's something you'll have to decide for yourself. [LAUGHING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [ENGINE HUMMING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [TORQUE WRENCH CLICKING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Mary? Well, morning, sleepyhead. I was beginning to wonder if I was going to have to come and wake you up. Pity. Hm, so is it good enough? Yes, my dear, you did good. Nice pants. OK, that's embarrassing. I'm going to get dressed. If you must. I'll see you in the lounge. Hello, stranger. I, uh... I thought you would have gone by now. You want me to go, do you? No. God, no. I am glad to hear that. There is something I've always wanted to ask you. What's that? Why Rommy? What do you mean? Why the name Rommy? It's short for Romulus. Yes, but you only have one sibling, a sister. Why were you named Rommy without a Remus? How do you know about Celine? You told me. OK. But you haven't answered my question. The truth is I did have a brother, and his name was Ramos. And he died when he was younger. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. It's OK. It was a long time ago. Well, that killed our mood. It doesn't have to. I, uh... one second. I've been saving this for a special day. If that's what I think it is, then let's. Yes. It's been a while. Mm-hmm. [LIGHTER CLICKS] This is good. I know, right? It's a pity I have to keep it hidden from Mary though. She doesn't like me smoking it But she's OK with you drinking? No, not in the slightest. She does like to try to control you, doesn't she? I don't think she's that bad. Oh, no, no, no, it's healthy for a relationship to be like that. You know what? She was actually really good back in the day. When we first started dating, she was happy, she smiled, I smiled. And in fact, she was the very first person to treat me like a person. You're more special than that. I'm not perfect. Oh, I never said that. [LAUGHS] I have seen you damn entire worlds to suffer their just fate. I mean, no one's perfect. [LAUGHS] Jesus, thanks. Thanks a lot. You know, we're sitting here talking about me all the time. How about I ask you a question? It seems fair. What would you like to know? Well, I don't really know a hell of a lot about you, apart from your fascinating and your green and you have a very beautiful face. Hey, I'm far more than just a pretty face. I hold a PhD in astrophysics and cosmology. Wow, pretty impressive. Mm-hmm. I only have a Bachelor in science, majoring in physics. Why haven't you got any further yet? Two guesses, Mary. She kind of stopped me. I can't imagine you giving in to anyone. I know. So what university did you go to? (WHISPERING) Must not say anything to anyone. (WHISPERING) OK. Where did you go? Mars University. Pfft. [LAUGHTER] Go the Martians. You went to Mars University? Whatever. [LAUGHTER] Hang on a minute. Does that make you a Martian? That makes you a Martian. Ah, yeah. You think because I'm green I'm a Martian. That's profiling. I slept with you. [LAUGHS] You helped me get in. So y... y... you say that we've known each other for some time, right? Yeah, for some time now. Well, not you. The other you. Which gets a little confusing. Yes, very confusing. So I've been thinking. You and me, were we together at all? (WHISPERING) I hate to do this... What? Especially after such a nice moment, but I wouldn't want you to think I was here just to take advantage of you. (WHISPERING) I don't think you could if you would. I think this might be serious. [LAUGHS] Because you always understand. Who, me? Shh. OK. What do you want me to do? What is it that you need me to do? I need you to get me two things. I need two meters of fiber-optic cables. So two meters of fiber-optic cable? Mm-hmm. And I need... well, this last thing is going to be a little tricky. OK. I need you to get me an SSD NASBook with fiber-optic connections. Would you like fries with that? [LAUGHS] Do you think you could do it? I don't think I can find that. Where am I going to find that? Go on, think. Actually... actually... actually... Mm-hmm? The school that is currently employed by my company, they are undergoing a massive development at the moment. That's why I'm doing the new manuals for them. They might actually have what you're after. Do you think they will? Yes, but there is no way I'm going to call them right now. I mean, it's a little bit suspicious, don't you think? I'd appreciate it. I'd do it for you. But what you're asking me to do is a little bit dangerous, and I don't want to get into trouble. I don't want to get caught. You can do it. Where are you going? Are you leaving? It is time. Well, I'll think about it. [LAUGHS] You'll do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hm. [CAR ENGINE HUMMING] [PARKING BREAK CLICKING] Good day? Uh, yeah. It was a good day. That's nice. Hey, you'll never believe this. Believe what? Um, well, I was talking to Gene today, and he mentioned that we've got a full-time position open in admin. And I thought it'd be great for you. OK, explain to me how that is great for me? Because it's a foot in the door, Rom. Gene said that you'd be on 40 grand a year, and then within three years be up to 45 grand. $45,000? I make more than that doing this. So why would I want to take a pay cut? Rommy, don't you want a steady job? I have a steady job. Rommy, it'd be really good for you, and everyone else does jobs like this. So I set up an interview for you with Gene on Monday at 9:00 AM. That should give you enough time to get ready and get organized and maybe tell the other job you're getting a real job. Mary, are you not hearing me? I have a real job. I just told you that. Rommy, you're an adult now. So start acting like one. I mean, I'm busting my goddamn ass out there trying to make a fucking living. I'm just trying to help you, Rom. Don't you want to make me happy too? [LAUGHS] Rommy, I never get what I want, and you know that. Oh, you never get what you want? No, I don't Oh, what a load of crap. What about me? I wanted to travel and then get that study offer up in Cambridge, but you wanted to buy a house, then a car, then it was all about your fucking career. Do you remember that? How can you still be mad at that? Well, I am. If you wanted to do other things, you would have fucking done them all. But you haven't, and here we are living in this fucking shithole. You're an adult, Rommy. Grow the fuck up, please. That's because you faked a pregnancy. You made your choices, Rommy. You made your choices. You want me to go to this meeting? Yes. How about I do this. I'll tell you to go fuck yourself. Rommy, I do fuck myself because you're not doing a good enough fucking job. [MUSIC PLAYING] So is it good enough? Yes, my dear. It's good. Decided to join the land of the living, did we, Rom? Decided to cook a meal, did we? I thought I was cooking. Don't be too thankful. I didn't know when you were coming back from your sook, so I didn't make you any. I wasn't going for a sook. I was having a nap. Well, how was I supposed to know? You know, Rommy, if you're still hungry, you can always just have a piece of bread and some peanut butter. Uh, hello, I'm allergic to peanuts. I know. I'm sick of you and your food allergies, Rommy. If you were hungry, you'd eat it. Where are you going? Well, I think I might go down the street and get something that's not going to kill me. When did you start wearing that terrible jacket? It looks shocking. There's nothing wrong with the jacket. You started wearing that thing when we started going out. Well, I wanted to change. You know what would be a good change? What's that, Mary? If you moved to China. Oh, crap. That'd be a good change, change of scenery, change of environment, change your life. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) You and I, we're not so different. We've got the same kind of games and disguises. You got to try to make the most of this life, Jack. There ain't no coming back. Yeah. There ain't no coming back. Yeah. There ain't no coming back. Yeah. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [GLASS SMASHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Hey, if you think about it. Always try a little bit harder then. You know I have faith in you. Keep on pushing a little bit harder and keep on growing just a little wiser than the last time. The last time. The last time. [ZIPPER SOUNDS] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? Hello, it's just me. Hey, Mel. Hope I didn't wake you. What's up? You are aware that you're overdue for your paper? Uh, excuse me? You're the one who changed the dates. Have you even done any work on it? Yes. I just need to see something. I will get it to you, OK? Well, you're running out of time because we're about to terminate the contract. Mel, there is no reason to threaten my job. Rommy, we know you've been working hard. Well, I'm glad you can see that Just start making progress. Well, I do see. Just get it to me, OK? Fine, bye. Jesus. [DIGITAL TONE] Mary? Of course you're not home. Are you here, green woman? I got those cables for you. I knew you'd be there. I could have sworn you'd be in here. Well, that's a shame. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Good morning, Romulus. I mean, Rommy. See? I told you I'd remember this time. You almost forgot. So how are you on this fine day? I'm well. Thank you. I have to say I'm surprised to see you out and about. Really? Sometimes I need to go out. So true. Yeah, sometimes I wish that I could just hide away. Oh, Audrey would never allow it. What brings you here? Work, as usual. The van was broken into last night. Stole a bit of expensive cable, not sure what kind. I can never keep up with that stuff. Me neither. Well, I hope you catch whoever did it. Me too. I didn't see anything, so I don't know. OK. Anyway, I must push off and keep investigating. No time like the present. Yeah, right. Right you are. This is me anyway, so. Speak to you later. Bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] Where have you been? A business meeting. No, stop on this show. Lloyd loves it. Oh, there's a ringing endorsement. Yeah, he likes baking. I'm sure he does. And I'm sure if I tasted his cakes, they'd taste awful. Well, I've tried his cakes, and they're scrumptious. And other girls at work have tried his cakes, and they love his cakes. They love his cakes. Really? Well, I don't think it's his cakes they love. Yeah, maybe you're right. You know, he's a good cook, but he's pretty handsome too. Oh, yeah, he's handsome. You know what? He's just so dreamy. Oh, Lloyd... Shut up... Lloyd. Rommy. Well, fuck Lloyd. You know, Lloyd's really smart and he's handsome and he's successful. All the things you are not, Romulus. So what are you trying to tell me? Are you trying to tell me that you're more attracted to Lloyd than me? No, no, that's not... [TELEPHONE RINGING] Because it certainly sounds that way. Saved by the bell, huh? Excuse me. Hey. No, no, no, no, it's fine. It's OK. No, it's OK, no one important. Really? Yeah, yeah. At the usual place? OK Yeah, no, I'll be right there. Bye. Telemarketer? Um, there's been a big mess up with some funds down at the office. So I'm... At the usual place, huh? Yeah, the main meeting room. I'm going to go have a shower. Shower? You look fine. Rommy, I need to look professional. You look professional. You know what? I think you're seeing Lloyd tonight. Oi, come here when I'm speaking to you. Mary, don't... oi. Fucking business meetings all the fucking time. I've got a business meeting. I've got a business meeting. [LAUGHS] Oh, it's you here. You know many other green women? Something on your mind? Yes, Mary has another business meeting tonight. A business meeting at 9:30 at night? Don't you start. Oh, what? I believe her. Like you could be mad at me. In fact, where have you been? Because I got that other item for you two days ago. Trust me, lover, I am back at the right time. The right time? What does that... Shh. Trust me. [LAUGHS] Wait, where are you going? Wait. Oh, relax. Besides, after hearing all these stories over the years, I have to see her. Shh, stop. Oi. Oh, my God. She's going to... Satisfied? Not really. No. But you wouldn't understand yet. You are not you yet. You know what? What does that even mean, I'm not me yet? You are you, just not you yet. You're not who you should be. Right, so now you think I'm a failure as well? When you first met me, you saved my life. Right there and then, and you never asked for anything in return. I could never think of you like that, never. I am not her. OK, I think you've actually got me mixed up with somebody else because I think I would remember that. In fact, I think I would remember you. I am glad to hear that. I will explain later. Now I need you to do something. Again? You still doubt me? I need you to trust me. I can see why you have issues with trust, but you need to do this for me. Why should I? It's me who risks my neck, not you. I don't even know if you're real or not. And you want me to go off and steal more stuff? You need to do it. You need to do it, and it won't be easy. So that's all people want me for, for I can do for them. Have I ever shown you anything but my respect? I suppose. And I suppose you should do this. But don't do it for me, for that woman. Do it for you. Give yourself a future that no one you know now can possibly have, a future you deserve. That's the point. How is that possible for me? Write down what I tell you, then think about it. But I need you to understand, it must be done tonight. All right, you know what? I'll take down details, but I'm not promising anything. That is wise. There is a man hiding here. His name is Ben. Ben? He's stolen something that belongs to me, more specifically you. You need to bring the item back tonight. What do you expect me to do, just walk up behind him and mug him? No, he's squatting here, hiding from me. Bring the item back, and I promise you I will never ask anything big of you again. Yeah, I'm not hurting anyone. You shouldn't have to, not that I would mind with him. Fine. Where does he... Where does he live? 22 Wattle Grove. The item will be there tonight. How do you know that? Well, I am the green woman and pretty damn brilliant, if I do say so myself. OK, how do I know I can trust you? There is not a lot you can trust in this life, but you can trust in me and in us. I promise you wonderful, unique man. [MUSIC PLAYING] [METAL CLANKING] Mary? Mary, you home? Obviously not. Oh, yeah. [DIGITAL TONE] Mary, is that you? Who else would it be? So what time did you get home from your business meeting last night? Light. I didn't bother waking you up. Why? What's your problem? Well, you have to admit, it does sound pretty suspect. Like you're one to talk. And what's that supposed to mean? [KNOCKING AT THE DOOR] Excuse me. Who is it? Oh, it's only Sergeant Fischer. I told you, you don't need to call me sergeant. I know, I'm sorry about that. So what brings you to my favorite bird on this fine morning? Rommy, why are you such a goddamn wanker? Because it pisses you off so much. [LAUGHS] Is this a bad time? No, no, no, not at all. If you'd like to come in, I just... we just boil the kettle. Yeah. No, sorry, not at this time. Just dropped by to ask you something. Oh, what can I do for you? Well, I've had a few incidents of late. More of those, huh? Yeah. It's been an increase in theft of high-end communication equipment Uh-huh. But that's not it. So what is it? Well, it appears that a squatter has broken into a family's house around the corner in Wattle Grove. And the occupant, he was attacked last night. Is he OK? Do you think Romney did it? He's OK. The family came home this morning and found him. That's good. They called an ambulance. He's in a stable condition. So how can we help you? I was kind of hoping that you might have heard or seen anything. Apparently, a person was seen heading in this direction. Uh... Rommy, you haven't done anything? I, uh... Fishy, I wasn't here last night, so I can't account for his whereabouts. I, uh... So have you seen anything? No, no, no, no, no, I didn't see anything. I'm sorry. Sorry I can't help. OK. It's, um... the woman said she saw someone about your height pacing in front of the house last night. Really? Really? I know you've had your problems this year, and I was surprised to see you out of the house last week. Yeah. But you're good one. Well, thank you. You've just been through hell in the last year. Well, I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me. OK. I'm going to head off, keep interviewing some of the neighbors. Cool. Good luck on the case and keep issuing those tickets. I'll speak to you later. Yes, see you. Bye. What have you done? Nothing. [SCOFFS] What? I don't want to hear this from you, OK? What? I don't need to be lectured on proper behavior, especially from the likes of someone like you. In fact, you know what? I don't even need you anymore. I'm over it. I'm so over us. Rommy, you can't do anything without me. I support you, Rommy. You have nothing, nothing. I'm sick of you making me feel bad all the time and bringing me down. I'm not stupid. In fact, I think we both know I'm a hell of a lot more intelligent than you will ever be. I hate you so much. I know what you've been doing. I know, and I can't have you in my life anymore. Rommy, if you do this, you'll regret it. You think so? I swear to God, you'll regret it. Come here. Do me a favor and don't let your fake ass hit the door on the way out. [MUSIC PLAYING] It is amazing how sweet and innocent they look at their age. Only they knew what they will become. They just look so happy, and they're just so innocent. They have such an amazing future ahead of them, and... But look, one is already beginning to dominate the other. Innocent or not, their natures will always win. You speak as though it was a sure thing. Oh, for them, it is. For just about everyone here it is. Look, if you're here to ask me to take something else, I'm sorry but you're on your own. I am not here to ask you to steal anything. I... I don't think that you're here because you want to see me. I hear what you are saying. I promise you I am here to help you. I would never do anything bad to you, never. But what is it that you want me to do? What makes you think I want anything? I see you have done nothing with the items yet. Was I supposed to? That's the question, isn't it? Don't do it for me. Do it for you. Well, you could do it for me. [LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BELCHES] So all these cords. But where do I start? I start at the beginning. Where's the beginning? [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, it's finished. Where are you? Morning, Rommy. Have you got it yet? Yes, I emailed it this morning. You should have it. I'll check that then. It's the third time. Look, Mel. I understand your position, but let me tell you I'm going to start looking for another writing job. But you've signed a contract that clearly states... I am aware of this. But hey, constant changing of deadlines, it's driving me a little bit crazy. I can't handle it anymore. What's that supposed to mean? Well, what it's supposed to mean is I quit. Oh. Hello? Wow, she hung up on me. OK, definitely don't tell Mary about that. Where is Mary? [MUSIC PLAYING] Did someone start the party without me? And so we're partying together now, are we? Are you OK? I'm sorry. I... I don't mean to be rude to you. I'm just... something weird has happened. I broke it off with Mary. Really? Yes. This is why I need this. Interesting idea. Yes, well, fiber-optic cables wasn't the only thing I found in that van. Rommy, what is this weird thing that happened? Well, like I said, I broke it off with Mary. And just like that, all her stuff's gone, everything. Everything's gone. And how do you feel about it? Well, you know what? The strange thing is I actually feel kind of relieved. Rommy, there is something I need you to see? No. Look, I'm... I'm over it. No more favors, no more stealing, no more hurting anyone. Please stop asking me. Haven't you worked it out yet? I've never asked you to do anything for anyone but yourself. Well, you know what? Your machine is ready. I'm so sorry, Rommy. I need you to see something, and it is going to hurt a lot. I'm just running out of time. Have you checked the second bedroom? What do you mean? I mean, all of Mary's stuff is in there. Yeah, right. You need to go in there, Rommy, you need to. No, I don't have to do anything, if I don't want to. We're running out of time. No, we're not running out of time. I don't want to go into the second bedroom. I said stop asking me to go into the second bedroom. Rommy, please... Rommy? Mary? Where have you been? Rommy, I never left. What are you talking about? Where's all your stuff? Rommy, you need to go into the second bedroom. Why? Because you need help. I'm not going into the spare bedroom. Rommy, we want to help you. I don't want to go in. Stop asking. Stop it. Don't you want to forgive yourself? Fine. OK, that's my handwriting, but I didn't write that. Yes, you did. Rommy, open it. Mary, why are your clothes in this box? Read the paper, Rom. Why are your clothes in the box, Mary? Mary, please tell me why are you clothes in the box? Why are your clothes in the box? Stop telling me what to do, the both of you. Oh, no. Jesus. [GROANS] No, no, I don't have to. Yes, you can. Look how much effort you are going to just to avoid looking at it. I can't do it. Don't make me do it. Rommy, read the paper. "Dead on arrival. Tragedy was discovered yesterday morning when a vehicle belonging to 27-year-old Mary Decker crashed into a tree in front of the Windsor Street Train Station. Miss Decker and her fiance Lloyd Hanson, 30, were found trapped in the vehicle when police arrived. Miss Decker was found dead at the scene with a high alcohol reading of almost four times the legal limit when Mr Hansen was found..." It says that you died in a car accident, Mary. It also says that you were engaged to Lloyd. Well, what is this? Is this some sort of a sick joke? Rommy, it's the truth, and you know it's the truth. Just remember, Rommy, just try and remember. I can't. I can't. It can't be true. I remember me and Mel, we just got out of a business meeting. For the first time in a long time, I was going to be home early. And I remember I couldn't wait to see you because I had such amazing news to share with you. And when I walked through that door, I found you and Lloyd on the couch over there on top of each other. He ran out of the room as quickly as he could, and you just stood there looking at me full of guilt. And then you said... Lloyd and I have fallen in love, and he's asked me to marry him. And I called you a slut and a whore and every other goddamn name under the sun because you really hurt me, Mary. You hurt me. But that's not what hurt the most. What hurt the most was when Lloyd was standing in the garden out there just waiting for you to run into his arms, and you did, right in front of me. And that's when I began to drink. And you got scared to leave the house. You forgot about everything except for your guilt and your pain. You fell apart. This was all my fault. No. No, Rommy. She was drunk, and she got behind the wheel of a car. So this is why you're here? It makes sense then of you to tell me how crazy I am. Rommy, you're not crazy. You're just in a lot of pain, hanging on to so much guilt. Mary, I want to use this opportunity to tell you that, uh, I'm sorry for all the pain I put you through. And, um, I'm leaving you for good. Goodbye. I'm sorry too. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHS] So this is why you're here? That is just one of the reasons you asked me to save you. Are you OK? Yeah, I feel fine now. Does anything seem unusual about it? No, not really. But it kind of does look a little bit like something I created in university, but... How interesting. No, that's not what I create in university because what I created in university is a device... Well, it's a device for giving specific locations in space. And time. Well, how can I do that? I can't do that. Not yet, but you really are a very clever boy. Hang on a minute. Are you saying that the future me will design this? Yes, and I will bring it to you. You need to make a choice, stay here and drown in this era or come with me. Have the universe as your playground and be someone. That's som... something. Use the device and take a chance or stay here drinking yourself to death. I don't want to do that. No, but the police will be here in less than five minutes. You left something behind. You need to choose where you want to be. OK, I will. Here? Yes. Oh, I'm so glad you decide to trust me, choose us. It's working. I feel nervous now. Of course you do. You may never get to see this place again. What do you mean? It's strange to think how normal this place looks. If only we know what it will be tomorrow. Hey, wait, wait, wait, I need some clothes or something. Clothes? You won't need clothes where we're going. [LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Falling from grace with another shadowed face. Another one to care about and then discard. Her counter distraught lace. Tying me to place. Another one that drifts along on and on. On and on and on. I want to tie you up Want to drag you out. Want to chew you up and spit you out. Want to tie you up and drag you out. The end, it's all with us. We've wandered for miles spinning in circles. I want you to try to escape the empty spiral spinning in circles. I watch you die. (SINGING) How could you replace that look of distaste. Another one I'll tear in two. I'm stuck on you. Once more for what we waste. For hours more we chased to find the one that's lost in you. We're just like you. You tie me up. You drag me down. You chew me up and spit me out. You tie me up and drag me out. The end is so endless. We wander for miles spinning in circles. I watch you dry, you die, you die inside.
