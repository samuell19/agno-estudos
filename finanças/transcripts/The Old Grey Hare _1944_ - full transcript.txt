[music] [xylophone] [music] [crying] I tried and I tried but I just simply can't seem to catch that old rabbit. [thundering] (male entity) 'If at first, you don't succeed, Elmer.' 'Try, try again.' Why, try again? Yeah. But how long will it take? 'Come, Elmer.' 'Let us look far into the future.' Will I eventually catch the rabbit? 'Come, Elmer.' 'Come past the years 1950.' '1960.' 'Past 1970.' '80. 90.' 'When you hear the sound of the gong' 'it will be exactly 2000 A.D.' tick Hey, where am I? What happened? I'm all wrinkled. Hey, what year is this? 2000 A.D.? Gracious. What's this? '"Bing Crosby's horse hasn't come in yet."' 'Hey, "Smellevision replaces television!"' 'Holy mackerel!' Where's my rifle? Oh, here it is. What? A Buck Rogers lightning-quick rabbit killer? Oh, boy. Now, let me at that little old rabbit. Let me at him. I'll liquidate him. I'll ruin him. Where's that rabbit? Where's that rabbit? E-ek. [crunching] What's up, prune face? Sh-h. I'm looking for a little grey rabbit. Eh, tell me, droopy, what's he look like? He looks...just like you. Not so fast there, grandpa. Ah-h. [smooch] [chuckles] You ain't got me yet, by gum. Oh, darn this lumbago. Stop or I'll shoot. Stop or I'll shoot. Darn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead! pess-s-s-ssh [groaning] [beeping] [coughing] Well...I guess you got me, doc. [gasping] I can't believe it. [coughing] Who turned off the lights? Why is everything so dark? Here's a little something I want you to keep for me, doc. What's this? Hey, this is a picture of me when I was a little baby. [rock-a-bye baby tune] Hey, doc. [coughing] Remember the first time we ever met? (Bugs Bunny) 'I can just see it all now.' [coughing] 'You came crawling along with your little popgun and I was..' [baby talk] Da-da. 'Ma-ma.' 'Go-go-go.' Da-da-da. Ha, ha, ha. O-oh! [sucking] I'm looking for a little baby bunny. I'm gonna shoot him dead. Bang, bang! Like that. - What does he look like, doc? - He looks...just like you. Do tell, do tell! [glass shatters] [music] Time for little babies to have their afternoon nap. Alright. [both snoring] [rock-a-bye baby tune] Okay. Nap over. [instrumental music] [screeches] [screeches] [tuba blaring] I'll get that little old rabbit. [tires screeching] [sirens wailing] Hey, pull over to the curb. [screeching] Oh, a pleasure driver, eh? You think you're going to a fire? - Well, I-- - Oh, resisting an officer, huh? thup-tha-thup-tha-tha And don't let it happen again. Hey, that was the rabbit. You ain't just whistling, dixie! [smooch] [crying] Yep. Those were the good old days, doc. [coughing] ♪ Memories ♪ ♪ Memories ♪ [humming] Oh, what have I done to you, old friend? Don't worry. We all gotta go sometime. This looks like the end. [sobbing loudly] Be brave. It won't be long now. No tears, now. Smile, smile. [both sobbing] This is it. Farewell, my old friend. So long. Don't forget to write, now. Adios! Saludos, amigo! Goodbye, my friend! So long, pal. Bye! So long. Bye-bye. Bye. Old friend. (Elmer) Goodbye, old buddy. (Bugs Bunny) So long, Methuselah. [Bugs Bunny laughing] Well, anyway, that pesky rabbit is out of my life forever and ever. Well now, I wouldn't say that. [smooch] [explosion]
