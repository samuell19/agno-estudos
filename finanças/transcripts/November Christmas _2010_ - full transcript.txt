(chiming) - Good morning, ladies. Hey, slow down and enjoy the ride! Idiot. (sighing) - Coffee break? - I... I need this. - I needed you to be on time this morning. Let's go, hmm? You're on dishes this afternoon. - Again? - Boo-hoo. Customers. Go. - He's been asking for you and he's in a foul mood. - That's a shocker. Hmm. I heard you missed me. - Yeah... - Want these in the cooler? - Yeah, put 'em there where I can get 'em. My dishwasher didn't show - again. (bell dinging) Thought people wanted to work. - Ah... - Where the heck did she go? Tammy! If my niece had her way, mornings would begin at noon. You hungry? - No, I-- - Well, grab a muffin before you head out. - Thanks, Wade. I'll see ya. - Nobody likes cold food. Table six. Go. - Whoop. - That would've not been pretty. - Sorry. - Uncle Wade's impossible. I would've been on time if he had let me drive the car. - You gotta prove that you're trustworthy. (Tammy huffing) - I'm here, I'm working! - And you gotta show a better attitude. (sighing) - He's making me stay after my shift to be the dishwasher - again. (muttering) - 'Morning, Tammy. - Yeah, good morning. (Tammy sighing) - Excuse me. - How are you this morning, Mr. Zachary? - Busy. Gotta unblock the Richters' kitchen sink, repair the netting on the Hammonds' screen door and build a hutch for a pet rabbit. Thank goodness for these helpless city folk moving in. - Thank you. - Can I get a muffin? - Yeah, sure thing. - Just lookin'. (sighing) - It's your turn, Gordon. - I spy... ... Vanessa sleeping. - Boo, I'm awake. (laughing) - Homeward bound. - Mom? - Yeah, sweetie. - The little girl inside the snow globe, she's holding another snow globe in her hands. - Really? - And it looks like... ... there's another little girl inside that one. - I didn't notice that. That's pretty cool. - But it's too small and I can't really see it. - Can I see? Pretty cool. - Hmm. - Feels good to be home, doesn't it? - Yeah. - Do you need me to help you unpack your backpack, sweetheart? - I'm okay. (soft music) - Okay. (sighing) Shhh. (ticking) It's from the school. We have to register Vanessa for third grade. - There's nothing in there. - Nothing eatable, as Gordon would say. Rice cakes and anchovies. - Yuck, as our daughter would say. - What do I say? - Look at what your daddy is thinking about eating. - Yuck. - It is yuck. - What are we gonna do today? - We're gonna take it easy, since we spent the morning in the car. - Why can't we do something? - Let's you and I go shopping for mommy. - I want her to take it easy. (Gordon): Can I get a toy?! - Oh... - How does he do that? I already got you a toy, buddy! - Just me and dad, Gordon! - Dad and me. And let's not yell. - Why can't I come? - Do you see what you've started? - It's back to normal. Hey, munchkins, come on, let's go, in the car. Maybe with us outta your hair, you can do a little something for you. We're gonna be okay. - How's it going? - Good. We have all the books in except for one on the fourth grade list, and that'll be here next week. - Fantastic. And... a new illustration. And check out the books in the Fall and Winter Reading Series. I used all you book suggestions. - I see. - Claire... I want you to run it. - Oh, no, Abby, I... I said I would do it for the summer, but-- - Come on, you love it. - I do. - And I wanna add another group, so with scheduling and overseeing the readers. I'll need you here one more day. - That would be three days a week away from the farm. Ah, I'll talk to Jess. - Sure. Thanks. - Dad? Dad. - Yeah, Gordo. - I'm gonna be Batman for Halloween. - Well, you outgrew that costume. - But I wanna be Batman. - Okay, I guess we'll just have to get a new one when the time comes. - When will that be? - Oh, not for a while. - Why? - Well, it's only August. - When's Halloween? - End of October. - How long's that? - That's a couple of months. - How long's a couple of months? - That's 60 days, buddy. Hey, honey. - Hey. - Miss Sunshine, you okay? - Mm-hmm. - You sure? You want me to take you home so you can rest? We can get our vegetables later. Tomorrow. - No, I'm okay. - Let's go! (Vanessa laughing) (car door closing) - Hello, Tom. Good to see ya. - You, too. Kids, say hi to Mr. Sanford. - Hi. - Hi. - Can we go see the animals? - If it's okay with Mr. Sanford. - Sure you can. Careful where you step. How long have you been livin' out here? - Mm, seven... eight months. Why? - Mr. Sanford was my dad. Call me Jess. Kids are sure growin'. - Ah... yep. Happened fast. - Yeah. Tomatoes on your list? - They are. Four. That's good. Let's make it six. - Kids like corn? - Sure. So do I. It's on the list: six ears. - Haven't seen much of you folks. Been gettin' your vegetables someplace else? - No, we, uh... We just been busy. - Well... busy's good. (cellphone ringing) Beats the alternative. (ringing) - Uh... excuse me. Hey. (clucking) Yeah, yeah, I, uh... I got the disk. (continues talking indistinctly) And... I'm gonna write the programme, so... - C'mere. Sit, sit. Sit. Sit. - What's his name? - His name's Stanley. (quacking) Good boy. - No, no, no, I was planning on being there, but now I, uh... I can't make it. Look, just call me after the meeting's over. Okay, bye. (Jess): Would like to... (Gordon laughing) (man): Could I return these? - Beth. - Hi, Claire. - Hi. I haven't seen you all summer. Everybody good? - Everybody's great. Yeah, we've just been in and out of town. Mm. - Y'know, we're gonna continue the preschool reading series in the fall. Gordon might really enjoy it. - Found it. I'll keep it in mind. It was nice seeing you. - You, too. Tell Tom and the kids hi. - Beth. - Hi. - Megan's mom. Rita. - Right. I'm sorry. Of course. It's... There's just been a lot going on. - Ugh, tell me about it. Summer camps, family stuff, kids getting ready to go back to school... - Yeah, right. - How's your daughter? Forgive me, I'm only asking because-- - It's okay. She's, uh... she's doing much better. It's nice seeing you. (chiming) - Yeah, I'll take two orders to go. - All right. - Thanks. - There's nobody here! - Yeah... (click) (Beth): How's your tummy feel now? (Vanessa): Okay. - Yeah? Come here. - When am I gonna get better? - Soon. - How long is soon? - Do you remember when we planted those flowers in the backyard? - Yeah. - Yeah? Remember they were very healthy when we first planted them? But after some time, they... ... wilted. So we cut them back and... you don't know this, but your daddy gave them some plant food to prepare them for the winter so that they could grow healthy again. It's just like that. Dr. Patel gives you medicine that sometimes makes you feel bad, but it's so you'll get better. Okay? - By Halloween? - Maybe. But probably more like Christmas. - That's not for... forever. - Hey, now... don't say that. Let's just say you'll be better by the time we have our first big snowfall. Okay? Want your covers all the way up? - Sure. - Snug as a bug in a rug. (Beth chuckling) - Love you. - I love you, too, sweetheart. - What do you say, Tom? - Jess. Do you have any pumpkins? - Pumpkins? No, too early. Got a lot of squash. Got some nice zucchini. - How long will it be before you have pumpkins? - Ah, nobody around here's gonna have any pumpkins till the first part of October. Been too cool and dry this summer. Maybe down in New York and New Jersey, but not around here. I'll have lots of 'em by Halloween. - Right. Okay. Thanks, Jess. - Sure. (car door opening and closing) (engine starting) - What was that all about? - I got no idea. Oh. We expecting company? - No. Why? - You made a pot roast... It's Monday night... - I was in the mood. - Lucky me. Mm. Apple? - Yep. - Yum. That old dog sure sleeps a lot. Suppose he's got a thyroid problem? - Oh, he's okay, he's just old. - That what you say about me? - You don't sleep that much. - It's all that pie you feed me. So what's up? - Abby wants to continue the children's reading series into the school year. She wants me to run it. It'd mean an extra day each week at the library, but... I'm thinking of saying yes. - Do it. I mean, you enjoy being there. You're great with the kids. Y'know, they're lucky to have you. - I saw Beth Marks. She came by the library. - Really? Tom and the kids stopped by the stand the other day. He's an odd one. - He's not odd, he's just young. - He came back again today lookin' for pumpkins. In August. That's odd. (thunder rumbling) (soft music) (thunder rumbling) - Can we keep the light on and my door open a crack? - Of course, sweetheart. And you just call out if you need anything, okay? - Okay. - Okay. I love you. Good night. - Good night. 'Night. - I think we should reregister Vanessa for school. - Her immune system's too weak to be around other kids. - Honey, you're just being-- - Don't make this about me, Tom. - Well, we can't keep her in a cocoon. Eventually, she's gotta go school. - She needs to get well first. - She's gonna get well. - I just... I don't think we should making any set plans right now. - That's exactly what we need to do. - I don't think you're being realistic. - But we moved here because of the schools. What would it hurt to meet the teacher, let Vanessa see the classroom. - No. No, we're not doing that. It's too much pressure. I don't want her feeling badly that she can't be around the other kids again. I'm homeschooling her this year. And, please, stop pushing me. Sorry. Hey. Sorry. - Okay. Me, too. - Why couldn't it have been me? - So what are we gonna do today? - We can watch a video. Okay. You wanna play a board game? We could do that. - Why do we have to stay inside? It's not raining anymore. - Can we go swimming? - Can we? - We still have that wading pool, don't we? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm? - It's for babies. Can't we go swimming? - No, we cannot go swimming. - We don't have to go swimming to have a good time. When I come back from my meeting, we can get outta here. (Beth): There's one. There's one right there. (Vanessa): Oh! - Look at him crawling. - Is that a baby? - I think it might be a baby, yeah. - Where's the mommy? - I don't know. Maybe if we're lucky we'll get to see her. - Oh! Is that her? - Yep. I think that's her right there. - Is that the mommy? (Beth laughing) - Careful, careful. Watch your toes. - Oh... - Watch your... watch your toes. (Tom ): Go on! Yeah! Now lift her up real high! There you go! Yeah, that's it! Get that thing going, buddy! (Beth laughing) - All right, let's go. (Tom ): Good! Whoo! - Whoo. (Beth laughing) - Yeah! - That's it! Faster, buddy! Faster! Yeah! Keep going, buddy! Faster! That's it! Yeah! - Let Vanessa have a try. Hey, Gordon, let Vanessa try. (Gordon): Yeah! - There you go, sweetie. Now come on-- - Go, honey, go! - Run, let's go. - Oh, yeah! - Whoo! - All right. (music) (Tom ): All right! Yeah! (slurping) (laughter) - Hey, slow down. Easy, buddy. - Who wants a topper? - Me! - Of course. (Beth laughing) - Hey, hey, hey, sweetie, where you going? - Oh, it's okay. (mixed chatter) - I have that book. - Uh... it's a really good book. - I know it by heart. And I have the same colour pencils. - Cool. Do you like drawing? - Mm-hmm. I draw animals and people. Sometimes they come out funny. - Uh... this is supposed to be a possum. (laughing) Do you think you could help me with this? - I only saw one possum in my whole life. But I sorta remember. - You're really good. What's your name? - Vanessa. - I'm Tammy. (bell ringing) - Did you just move here? - Five months ago. Do you... read a lot? - Mm-hmm. It's my favourite thing. And drawing. - I'm thinking about writing a book. - That'd be good. With a possum? - Tom, can you call them again? - Guys, breakfast! Let's go! Guys! (sighing) - Dad. - No fever, no worries. - We've been overdoing it. I knew we should've kept her at home. - Beth. - I'm an idiot, thinking everything is okay. - Everything is okay. - I'm calling the doctor. It's okay. (sighing) - You just have to get some rest, then you're gonna be good to go. Okay. (soft music) (quacking) - Sorry! (cellphone ringing) (ringing) (ringing) (ringing) - Hi, hon. How's she doing? - Hi. So she went right back to bed after she finished her lunch. And I talked Dr. Patel again and she said she didn't need to see her. - Well, the doctor would've has us bring her in if she had a fever. - Well, I think I should've insisted that I bring her in. - She... she's got an appointment next week. Get all her levels checked and you'll see, they'll be good. You were right, we overdid it. - Okay. I gotta go. - I'm almost home. - Okay. - Don't see you for a month and now it's three times in one week. - Sorry, I probably... should've called first. - I probably wouldn't have answered. - Sure is peaceful out here. - Yes, it is. - Say, would it be possible for me to choose a Christmas tree? - No, we don't tag trees till mid-November. Sorta like hangin' on to these... long summer days. If I could stop time, I'd stop it right now. - November for tree tagging. - Right. - Thanks. - Sure. I know what Tom's up to. - Tom who? - Marks. Beth's husband. That little girl of theirs is sick. He's movin' up the clock. - What does that mean? - He's pushin' everything forward. He's... he's looking for pumpkins and Christmas trees in the middle of summer. He's gonna make sure she has a Halloween or a Christmas. - Did he say something to you? - It's what he's not sayin'. (knocking) (knocking) (sighing) I need your help, Teddy. My neighbour's little girl is really sick. - What do you want from me? - Pumpkins. Your nephew still grow 'em? We sold a lot of melons and apples down this way. You believe what they're sayin' about... ... winter comin' in the middle of October? - Pfft. Well, the thing about the weather is, not matter what's predicted, we find out soon enough if it's true. - I'm sorry, Teddy. Should've said it a long time ago. When Stevie died... ... we just couldn't get up from it. Then you lost Ellen. And I wasn't there for ya. Claire and I loved her dearly, you know that. I'd like to think Ellen'd... understand. And if she would, maybe you could too. This whole thing between us has... ... gone on for too long. I've been really stupid. - Yeah, well, we, uh... ... we both been through a lot. - We're okay, then? - We're okay. (soft music) There you go. Go it? (Jess): Got it. - There you go. (Jess): Yeah, there's a couple of beauties. - Rick! Tell your uncle and Mr. Sanford that they're stayin' for dinner! - If Lily's isn't happy, no one here is. - I've never turned a free meal down yet. Thanks. - What are you workin' on? - Uh... the great American novel. For kids under seven. - How's it going? - Uh... would it be too clich? to say I have writer's block? - Doesn't look like it from where I sit. You know, if you're into kids books... we could use some help with the preschool reading series at the library. If you have some free time. - Yeah, maybe. - Great. - Lily, that meal was fantastic. - Mm. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Susie, I'm so happy you were able to join us. - Well, thanks for inviting me. - Susie lives close by. - Mm. I live 10 minutes away in town. - She's got family in Sullivan. - My first cousin, Laura Booker. - I know her husband. Used to play ball with him. - Hmm. - You get up to Sullivan often? - Well, Ted comes down here mostly. (Ted): Ah... - Hmm. - Maybe we should be going soon. - Well, why don't you guys just stay over? - We've got the room. - Well, you won't have to twist my arm. Just gonna have to call my wife and let her know I won't be home. - Good for me. (Susie laughing) (kids chatting and laughing) - Not too late to drive home. I like Susie. - Me, too. - And she likes you. - I know. I can't imagine how I managed to be so lucky. Twice now. - Well, I can. - I wasn't sure what you'd think. - I think it's great. Ellen would've wanted you to be happy. (distant barking) (Jess singing): Oh Susie Q Oh Susie Q (Ted chuckling) Oh Susie Q - Enough. Baby I love you Susie Q - Hey, Gordon. What's up? - Am I gonna get sick? - What? - Am I gonna get sick? - No. - Why's Nessa sick? (turning off water) - Well... uh... I don't know, sweetie. That's... ... one of those questions we don't know the answer to. - Like if there are other little girls in Vanessa's ball? - In Vanessa's snow globe? - Vanessa tries to see how many little girls are in there. She says we'll never know. - Well, yeah, Vanessa's right. That's another one of those questions we'll know the answer to. But you know what? - What? - Your sister is very tough and she's teaching us all how to be strong. - I'm strong. - Yeah. You are the strongest little man that I know. (Beth): Tom! Gordon! Get down here! - Come on. - Oh! Look at all the pumpkins! - Oh! - Wow! Are these all for us? - Well, read the note, honey. - "What do you know, found a few ripe ones. Jess Sanford." - Whoa! There's gazillions of 'em! - What are we gonna do with all of 'em?! - Uh, well, we're gonna decide after the two of you get dressed. Go on. Go up and change your clothes. - Mommy rules. C'mon, go upstairs and change. (Vanessa sighing) - What did you say to Jess to get him to bring you an entire pumpkin patch? - Nothin'. I just asked when he'd have some. - What are we gonna do with all of these? - Let's have an early Halloween. - But it's August, Tom. - I know, but we have pumpkins. Let's... let's throw a Halloween party. It'd be great. Turn the living room into a ghost house. - Vanessa, we're having a Halloween party! - Gordon, what did we say about listening in on our conversations? - Come on, go upstairs and change, buddy. Hurry up. - Are you serious about this? - Let's move up the holidays. Move up Halloween, then the next holiday, then the next. As many as we can give her for however long. - What? All this time you've been cheering us on and you don't believe any of it. You don't think she's gonna make it. Look at me. - What's wrong with creating a little happiness for our daughter right now? I just want her to be happy. - "Our neighbour, Mr. Sanford, "had planted pumpkin seeds that magically grew during the night. "There were big ones and small ones, "orangey ones and yellowy ones. "I was the luckiest girl in the world "and Gordon was the luckiest boy. "We were off to our neighbour's farm to thank him got helping us get pumpkins for a special early Halloween just for us." - We made these for you. - Well, thank you, Vanessa. Pink cookies are my favourite. - They're strawberry. They're dad's favourite, too. - We're having a Halloween party. I'm gonna be a cowboy. Right, Dad? - That's right, bud. - And I'm gonna be a princess. - Well, that wouldn't be much different from what you are every day, would it? - I'll be turtle! - Turtle? Good choice. - Um, yeah, you're not the one who has to make the costume. (quacking) - You wanna go see the geese, go ahead. (kids giggling) (Gordon): Come on, Stanley. (barking) Look at the geese! - I still don't know how you did it. (Vanessa): Come on, over here. - But I owe ya. - I've been paid, Tom. - Thank you. - Thank you. (barking) (Gordon): Here, boy. - Gordon? - It's okay, Mom! Stanley's my friend! - Hey. - Hey. - Some women get diamonds... you shower me with pumpkins. - Got a bit carried away. They're throwin' themselves a Halloween party Thursday night. - You were right. (soft music) (door opening and closing) What were you doing up there, Jess? - They're not his things. Just Halloween stuff. Y'know, I wonder if I would've thought about doin' somethin' like this for Stevie if I'd had a chance. (soft music) (shrieking) (girl): Get away! (horn honking) (sighing) - About time. (kids shouting) All right, you kids, pack it up! - Ah! (girl): Ah! - No! Get off! - What part of "quit" do you rascals not understand?! I got wrangled into babysittin' my nephew's kids for the mornin'. - I see. I brought you a little reward for your 400-mile drive. - Pumpkin? - Good guess. - You get 'em all delivered? - I got 'em delivered. They're plannin' on havin' a Halloween party. I'm takin' some stuff over there now. What's that look? - I get it, Jess. I know what you're doin'. 'Cause you're gettin' real involved here. I just hate seeing you go down that road again. - That road is always gonna be there, Ted. And there'll be times when I'm gonna go down it. So will Claire. That's just the way it is. But if I can put a smile on that family's face... I'm gonna do it. And that's the way that is. How's Susie? - She's good, thanks. - Good. (sighing) (knocking) - Ahem. - What do you say, Tom? - Jess! What's all this? - Some old Halloween stuff out of our attic. Got a little more in the truck. It's yours if you want it. - Ah... Sure. Thanks. Uh... you want a cup of coffee? - Yeah, coffee'd be good. - Okay. - Been a long time since I've been in this old house. - D'you always live here in Sullivan? - No, I grew up in the Southwest. I came up here after the army and... met Claire and... that was it. There used to be an old stone fireplace where this bar is. - Really? Wish they'd kept that. - Amazing, huh? (phone ringing) - Excuse me. Hello? Why haven't you left yet? Her platelets were that low? Even after the transfusion? Yeah, I know, I know. Just... Okay, just... just get home safe. - It's right what you and your wife are doin'. (birds chirping) - If it were anybody but you, Mr. Sanford, on my rock... I didn't know you hung out here. - My son and his friends used to play hockey here in the winter. That was his dream... ... playing hockey for the NHL. (chuckling) All I ever wanted to do was play baseball when I was his age. How about you? You know what you wanna be? - Happy? - Sounds simple enough, doesn't it? - Actually, what I really wanna be is a writer. - Really? - Yeah. - How'd you decide on that? - I've been keeping a journal since I was nine. Y'know, my escape from my mom and what was going on in my house, but... you probably know all of this. - Wade never said anything to me. Other than you were his niece and you were stayin' with him. - My friends and I got picked up by the police a couple of times. - Ah. - I mean, nothing serious, but, y'know, I had to produce a parent; otherwise... foster care. And I couldn't find my mom. Big surprise, right? So I called Uncle Wade and... he came right away and brought me here. - Yeah. - Started writing a children's book. And I dunno. (laughing) Maybe it's stupid. What do I know about kids? - I'll bet you know a lot about kids. - Yeah? Why? - Well, you were one once. And not that long ago. I don't think anybody really knows if they're good at anything till they try it. If your dream is being a writer, then I say write. Gotta tell ya, I came here today hopin' I'd see ya. I got a favour to ask ya. Might involve actin' like a kid again. (soft music) (Beth): Okay, Vanessa, turn around. Wait, let me... let me get your arm through. Okay, here we go. Turn around. Okay. (Vanessa laughing) You look really good. Do you feel good? - Yeah. - You look exactly like a turtle. (Vanessa giggling) (doorbell ringing, knocking) C'mon, let's go see who it is. - C'mon. - C'mon, buddy. - Stop it. Stop it! - Shhh, they're coming. (all): Trick or treat! - I don't have any candy to give. - Doesn't matter. We're just here for the party. - Well... well, come on in. (kids chattering) - Happy Halloween! Happy Halloween! - Hey, Vanessa. (excited chatter) - Hi. - Hi. (kids): Oh! (boy): Good job! (girl): Good job! (all exclaiming) (kids): Oh! - I know, it's really cool. - Yeah! (girl): Do it again! (all exclaiming) (girl): Thank you. (Beth): You're very welcome. All righty. (woman): Oh, I like that. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. - Thank you. (mixed chatter) (laughter) The door to the passageway was stuck. Their only light from their one candle was flickering and flickering. It went out! (kids gasping) Tiny flashes of light scurried about: mice or something worse. She's coming... She's coming. The witch is coming. They tried the door once more as the cries got louder and the witch was coming up closer to them and BOOM! (kids shrieking and laughing) Okay. (mixed chatter) (soft music) - Well? (Ted chuckling) - Happy Halloween. - Yeah. - Anybody home?! - Over here, Tom! (mooing) - Sorry it took me a couple of weeks to get this stuff back to ya. - That stuff was for the kids. You didn't have to bring it back. - Oh, thanks. - So? How'd the party go? - Yeah. Great, yeah. They, uh... Gordon and Vanessa really appreciated the kids comin'. We... we did, too. - Ah, good. - Yeah. - Can't have a party without a few kids. - Right. - Glad it went good. - Thank you. - Hey, uh... you got time, we can go over to the tree farm and put a tag on one for ya. - I'd love to.

(girl giggling) (talking indistinctly ) "D". "D". (laughing) - "Gracie was hungry. "It was early morning in the public gardens "and she was ready for breakfast. "Gracie launched herself into the cool water of the fountain, "fluffing her feathers "as a spray sprinkled all around her. "The gates of the public garden would soon be unlocked "and Mr. Black Suit usually arrived shortly after. "He would sit on the park bench "to drink his coffee, "and he always shared his breakfast with her. "Muffins, thought Gracie, "as Mr. Black Suit appeared around the bend. "That looks like a muffin bag. Oh, yummy!" (voice fading) - I, uh, wanna take you up on your offer to help with the reading series, if it's not too late? - It's never too late. What days are you free? - Uh, since school started, I'm free Saturdays and Thursday afternoons. - Saturdays work. - Ah, great. - This is the reading list and the dates. - "The Five Chinese Brothers." Great book. "Harold and the Purple Crayon." My mom used to read it to me when I was little. The good early years. - My son loved that book. (woman reading) I'm glad you're here. - Me, too. - "... gardens through the swinging gate, crossed the road..." (whispering): Is this boring for you? - The best part of this book is the pictures. - You're right. It's a cool hat. You wear hats a lot? - It's because I don't have any hair. - My best friend likes to shave her head. So I started writing that story we talked about. - The possum one? - Yeah, only now it's a rooster. - That's better. - I'm calling it "My Secret Pal." - I drew a rooster, we have it on the wall. - Could I see it sometime? - Come to our house. - Okay, sounds great. Maybe you can help with the story. Do drawings for it, if you want to. - Okay. - Okay. (woman reading) (soft music) ? Ever see the wild goose ? Sailing on the ocean ? Ranzo me boys ? Oh Ranzo ? Ray ?

Sails away This was so great. And that pie! (laughter) - Thanks. It's one of Jess's favourites. - I can see why. So how did you two meet? - Oh... Once upon a time in the '60s. Jess had come up here for a concert at a nearby farm and I was one of the locals working the show. I saw him standing and waiting at the first aid tent. He had this terrible cut on his foot. Oh, he was... so handsome. And my uncle was the town doctor, so I offered him a ride into town and... ... he said yes and he never left. What about you two? - Uh, we met at our first job right out of college. Oh, could he make me laugh. I miss those days. - Beth... ... you know we're... just right down the road... ... if you need anything. - Thank you. (soft music) - Those your old toys? - Those belonged to our son, Steven. He died when he was 13. - What happened? - Comin' home from a hockey game... ... minivan hit a patch of ice on the highway. Lost control. Stevie and the driver died on the spot. Someone tried to comfort me with the notion that... ... when a child is taken... ... their soul only had a tiny mission to accomplish here. That's why they were blessed to depart. Needless to say, God and I haven't seen eye to eye since. (sniffling) - I'm scared outta my mind, Jess. Vanessa's so strong... ... I just can't shake the feeling that we're gonna lose her. - You've been dealt a bad hand, Tom. I wish I could change it. What'd he do? - He threw a ball through the chapel window. (Jess chuckling) - Fella's got a good arm. - Sure does. - I need to ask you a favour, Bob. In your daily prayers... ... would you mind puttin' one in for my neighbours? Tom Marks and his family. His little girl, Vanessa. - Yeah, will do. - Thanks. - But, you know, your prayers have just as much weight as mine. - Yeah. Been a long time since I was one of his regulars. - God knows you, Jess. And he never stopped listening. - Thanks. - The dishes are in the rinse cycle, I placed the order for tomorrow's pastries, and I will be back before my shift starts. - Wait up, Tammy. - What'd I forget? - I don't want you ridin' your bike in the dark. - It'll still be light. - No bike. Eyes on the road the whole time, no speeding, no radio. Hmm? - Thank you. (Vanessa): This is supposed to be a cloud. (Tammy laughing) - Is that your doctor? - Uh-huh. It's Dr. Patel. She's really nice. - Is that you? - Mm-hmm. It's me with hair. This one is a watercolour. So is this. And here, is my second pair of drawings. It's pastels. - You're really, really good. - Hmm. - Can I see more? - Sure. (soft laughter) This is like on the farm. (soft laughter) And this is supposed to be Stanley. (laughter) And... this, is at the bottom of the sea, I think. And this is a princess on a unicorn, and she's gonna go all the way up the mountains and she's gonna find her true love up there. (laughter) - Hey... here's my helper. - Thanks a lot. - Thank you. I wanted some company today. - Buddy, I'm gonna be back right after dinner. - How long is that? - Not long. - We're gonna be so busy, you won't know where the time went. Let's go sneak up on Mr. Sanford and Stanley, okay? Okay, so I'm gonna show you something, Gordon, okay? This is where it's... - Vanessa's counts are down. - Well, they've been down before. - Yes. However, this time, lymphoblasts appeared on her blood smear. We have to admit her now and start a new round of chemo. - What... what does that mean? - We begin again with a new drug. One day at a time. - Here you go, buddy. - When's my daddy gonna be here? - As soon as you get up from your nap. - Are you gonna stay with me? - I am. - And Stanley? - He's already here. (dog whining) (mixed chatter) - Hey, Jess. I heard you've had yourself a young boarder these past few weeks. - Only during the day. His dad picks him up again at night. - Things workin' out okay? - It's workin' out fine. Claire has really taken to little Gordon. It's been nice for all of us. We like havin' little feet under us again. I'm sorry it's not under different circumstances. - How's the little girl doin'? - She's fightin' the fight. I'm headin' over there now. - Tell her hi for me? - I will. - It's wonderful, what you're doing, Jess. - Thank you, Bob. - Listen... if they need any... takeout meals or... anything, let me know. - Same here. Well, that's what it's all about, huh? People reachin' out. - Yeah. See ya. (soft music) (Beth): She's really weak. - They're talkin' about sendin' us home soon. They have to stop the treatments till she gets stronger. - Did they give you any idea? - All her counts have to go up. These drugs really beat her up. So in a month... six weeks, we'll see if she needs to come back for more treatments. - Gordon can stay with us for as long as you need to be here. You guys oughta get outta here for a while. Take a walk. Breathe some real air. (distant conversation) Let me go and sit with her for a while. It'll be all right. Go on. (PA): Dr. Gregory, please report... Dr. Gregory, please report to Physical Therapy. - Hi. - Hi. Okay if I sit with you for a little bit? - Sure. - How you doin'? - I'm okay. How's Stanley? - He's good. I know he'd like to see ya. - My dad says we're going home soon. But I might have to come back at Christmas. I don't like it here. I don't wanna be here for Christmas. - That's why I'm here. I have it on good authority that you will be home for Christmas. I want you to rest up. Be ready to celebrate. Okay? - Okay. (soft music) - He was under the Christmas tree and my son Stevie was about two. What, you like it? - Wow. (Claire laughing) And then, look at this. This big guy... is Mr. Billingsly. - Wow. - And he... has to know everything that's going on around the house. (Gordon laughing) And he asks lots and lots of questions, just like you-know-who. - Me. - You, yeah. - Wow. - And then, there's this. - Whoa. Can we play with him? - Well, when it stops raining, I'm gonna take you outside and I am gonna see how fast you can make him run. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Wow... - Wanna hold him? - Uh-huh. Wow...! - It's... so much better than I expected. It's simple and... and great. - Mr. Tim should wear glasses. - I have to go. I have my uncle's car and I can't be late. But, hey, next time we get together is at my house, okay? Come on, Vanessa, you got a book to work on. I mean, you've seen how I draw. (mixed chatter) (PA announcement) (sighing) - I proposed to Susie today. She accepted. - She did? - I want you to be my best man. (chuckling) - Are you sure she said yes? (Ted laughing) - Shhh... Come on. (Beth): Let's go! - Bye. - Thank you both so much. - Thanks. (soft music) (indistinct chatter) - It's beautiful. (Vanessa giggling) (Tom ): Come on, honey. (Beth): Come on, sweetie.

It's Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Vanessa. (Vanessa): Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Vanessa. - Merry Christmas. - Come on, sweetie, let's go inside. (Claire ): Come on, Gordon. (Vanessa giggling) - I don't know how to thank you. - You don't have to thank me. Just go inside and be with your family. (soft music) (music soaring) (older Vanessa): "Just as my mother had promised, "by the first snowfall, I did begin to get better. "And just as I believed the girls in my snow globe went on and on, "I saw and began to believe in the endless possibilities for me. "The real medicine for my recovery "was the boundless goodness shown to me and my family. "And just as we became part of our little town, "I became part of something nobody was sure I would ever be a part of: this wonderful world." Thank you. (indistinct comments) Thank you. (girl): That was really good. (girl): It was really a good story. (girl): I love your writing. - Oh, bye. Bye, sweetie. Bye. - Bye! - Bye-Bye. - Bye. - See you soon! - Merry Christmas. Bye. (woman): Don't forget your backpack. Come on, guys. (man): You liked that, didn't you, buddy? (indistinct chatter) - Was that story really about you? - Yeah, it was. - Did you have to go back to the hospital? (woman): All right, let's go. - Between you and me, I did. But pretty soon after that, I really did get better. - That's good. - Yeah, it is. Have a great Christmas. - Thank you. - Bye. (man): Okay. Yeah. Get the car.
