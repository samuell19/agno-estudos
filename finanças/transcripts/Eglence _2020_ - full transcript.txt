A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Come on. Tell me. It's Işik. So that's what's up. A pretty girl. I can't tell her how I feel. She thinks I'm mocking her. Anything I say makes it worse. Probably because you say shitty things. It's that bad? Yeah, you suck at this. Because when you insult someone, they think that you don't like them, douchebag. Mm, poor guy. Do yourself a favor: don't talk anymore. You know what you should really do? You should just kiss her. Seriously. Just shut up and kiss her. And once you do... your problem will be solved. Everyone, let's take it from the top. Come on. Lift them up. Higher. Sinan, you gotta lift it up higher. [girl] My umbrella's stuck. [Burcu] Hold on, I'm coming. Guess whose birthday's in three days! My mom is throwing a party with cake and everything. - Ah, sounds like she's going all out. - Mm-hm. - Mm. - That's great. Isn't it funny how self-important birthdays are? Celebrating another year that you didn't die. As if that's an accomplishment. How is this party self-important? It's a way my family shows their love. And it's nice for us to be together. I was just observing. Okay, you're distracting us. Enough talking. Just go stand over there like you're supposed to. [Burcu] Okay, everyone lift. Back down. This isn't working. You and I need to work together on this. And what's with you not even bothering to show for rehearsals this afternoon? Can I maybe get a word in for a second? I've had some things I need to handle. I'll be there tomorrow. That's fine. You don't need to be rude. I guess I'm sorry. So what are you busy with? Please just leave. Fine. - Psst, Burcu... He say anything? - What are you talking about? You were talking with Kemal. To be honest, I thought you were into him. Only, now that you're engaged, everything makes perfect sense. You're just good friends. How about putting in a good word for me? - You want me to set you up with Kemal? - Yeah, that's right. Kemal and me. Because I'm not getting anywhere. What else can I do? Whenever I try to approach, he goes right back in his shell. But with a little encouragement from you... Uh, yeah, I don't think I can do that. You know, we actually aren't even that close. - I don't think I can help you with this. - That's fine then. I have plans. I'll keep them a surprise. We'll just have to wait. [car door opening] - Pick you up later? - No, I'll find my own way home. - So do you have plans today? - I don't know. Whatever happens. - Hey, slow down, kids! - Okay, see you later. [Ali] I said I'm going to pay you, bro. Listen to me. Oh, sorry, man. Look, I'm already selling my land for half what it's worth to pay you back. So just cut me a break on the deadline. Yeah, later. Man, I'm so sorry. I got carried away talking to that asshole. - It's really all right. - You know, sometimes I don't get people. As if I'm not going to pay him back. He keeps talking and talking. I'm over here taking a huge loss all on his behalf. I mean, if only I could find a buyer. Have we met before? No, unless I forgot. Oh, I'm so bad with names. No, I'm thinking of somebody else. Beg your pardon. You know, I overheard you talking about some trouble you're having with a piece of land. Is that right? Where exactly is the property located? - And? - It's done. Fed him some bullshit about how great the area was, and he's like, "I work for the Land Registry Office. I know this stuff." - He doesn't know shit. - What happens now? Now we get his down payment, when he finally goes to visit the place, my cousin will give him the tour. - Are we good? - I think we got him. This guy has no idea what's coming. [school bell rings] [all cheering] Eda! What do you want? Um, do you want to walk home together? So we can talk, pick up where we left off? About what? You know... Our stuff, you and me... There's no you and me. Because Kerem and I are supposed to meet later. And I don't think you want him to see the two of us talking. - No, 'cause we worked it out. - You worked it out? He said you dumped him. So he came to me and basically said go for it. Guess he doesn't want to get in the way. So you can relax now with me, because we can be together. - Hang on a second. Kerem told you this? - He did. So then, he doesn't have a problem if I go out with you, or something like that? Yeah, that's right. He can't control you anymore. - There's nothing standing in our way. - I know. But if I were to kiss you right here, Kerem really wouldn't care? You wanna kiss me? Just like the other day... without interruptions? Wait, just stop. Look... I've got stuff to do now, but we can talk about this later on. Okay, bye. Bye. [doorbell rings] Here. [rock music playing] - Talk to me. - Talk about what? Do your character analysis thing on me. Because I'm seriously stuck here. I keep fucking up, making the same mistakes. So go ahead and tell me what's wrong with me. I don't want to get hit. I'm not gonna hit you. I just want you to fix me. Shit! I promise I won't get upset! So your image of yourself is a brave woman who doesn't give a fuck. But underneath it all, you actually are a coward. Your drawings, for example. I know you don't want to grow up to be some housewife who just doodles while her kids are taking a nap. But can you stand up to your parents and say, "I want to study graphic design"? You can't. And then there's this thing with Kerem. What? We can all see it. But you're running away. Running away is what you do. - I do not run away. - You asked me what I thought. Tell me more. I'm listening. You don't make any choices. You want to be chosen. You live your life according to what other people think. So what you really want... the things you want to study, the person you want to be with... none of it matters to you, as long as it looks good to someone else. Living to please others. That's cowardly. And then there's the weight issue. I can see you're starving yourself for no good reason. Better if we don't talk about that. Okay, look. You don't understand. I have to worry about my appearance because society is forcing me to do it. Just look at how we talk. If you get fat, that's seen as a weakness. If you get fat, people think you should be ashamed, that you chose to look like that. I mean, maybe men don't have it as bad, but people don't even see a fat woman as a woman. So I have to be thin if I want to be seen. That's the way the world works. Maybe that's the way things work in high school. But none of that applies in the real world. So when the Nobel Prize is awarded, do they care about it then? "Whoa, what a brilliant physicist. If only she weren't so fat." People aren't livestock waiting for the judge. - Confidence should be enough in itself. - [scoffs] Confidence. What do you know? Did you kiss Işik? - Not yet. - Why not? - [Tuncay] Ah. You're just in time. - [Burcu] Where are you going? - Something has come up. - What thing? Listen, I just need two days to sort things out. - I hit the jackpot this time. - I don't understand. You're not making sense to me. My love, I'll handle it. You don't worry about a thing. You didn't touch any of that money we saved up for the wedding, did you? No, it's all right where we left it. Is there something I should know? No, it's nothing like that. Nothing to worry about tonight. I'll be back in two days, okay? How will you even survive without me? [adult Işik] We didn't know then, but we were making the biggest mistake of our lives. We were all so naive. How could we have known how serious the consequences would be? [Osman] Tuncay's gone for two days. Ms. Distas will be alone. We could just swing by her place and see how she's feeling. - About what? - To see if she's still marrying this guy. Maybe she's got cold feet, or maybe we can talk to Mr. Altuna. - We need to do something. - Change your mind about the fiancé? Just being safe. But it's looking good. Ms. Distas is confused. I think Işik and I should go alone. None of you guys are good at talking to women. [Osman] Great. You guys talk to her, woman to woman. - Good. - I have to be at my party tonight. Yeah, let's just all give up because it's her birthday. No, no. She's right. - Up to you. - [Eda] It's not a big deal. It'll be a short visit. You can go to your birthday right after. Come on! Okay, I'll come. [crowd clamoring] Mr. Engin, so good to see you. Welcome to our school. - We are so honored by your visit. - Thank you, Necdet. Everything ready? - Why don't you lead the way? - Will do, sir. They turned out beautifully. Please, I'll take you there myself. Thanks to your generosity, our students have access to the latest technology. We would love to name the facility after you. I proposed the idea, and the entire staff agrees with me. There's no need. I didn't make my gift hoping for anything in return. What would people think of me? Uh... well, of course, we still need to name it. - [sighs] - Since you made the donation, you should be the one to name this wonderful... Listen, the name doesn't matter to me. Why don't you just name it after yourself, Necdet? My only concern is that your students make use of it. I just want to give back to the school I graduated from. That's fine. However you want things to go. Thank you again for this gift. Bless you, sir. May God bless you for this! [laughs] [Kerem] Shh, here comes Mr. Karakis. [Necdet] Are you still enrolled here, you little pricks? Ah, that's right. You have a guardian angel. Once Ms. Distas leaves... I'll sign each of your fuck-off letters personally. I'm just waiting for the ink to dry. [chuckles] What's up with you, Sinan? Where's your usual pretentious gibberish? Is something wrong? Hmm? You're very quiet today. [laughs] - Boo! [chuckles] - [Kerem chuckles mockingly] [Necdet] You're done, suckers. If we're all fucked anyway, might as well go out with a bang. Hey, dude! Dude! Confident, isn't he? I wonder what happened. Good day to you! [laughs] - Good day to you, Ms. Distas! - Good morning to you, sir. Our last days with you, huh? Happy times and adventures in your future. [chuckles] So what's up? - Seems like you just got good news. - I have. This morning, I was giving Mr. Engin a tour of our new lab. He told me, "You've done so much for this school, Mr. Karakis. Allow us to dedicate this facility in your name." And I humbly accepted. Quite an honor. Congratulations. [melancholy music playing] [indistinct chatter] [Burak] Hey, there. You ditched me yesterday. Let me take you to dinner. Burak, hang on a second. It's just, you might have the wrong idea. Oh, look at this! [chuckles] This is great to see. - Have fun with her, Burak. - Sounds like a good idea to me! Burak, I'd be happy to have dinner with you wherever you want. Only she won't eat. So you save some money. No, I'm starving. Can't wait to eat something. Now that there's nothing to ruin my appetite anymore... Come on. I know a great place we can go. Uh, we'll get two pints of beer, fries to share, and two hot dogs. Anything else? - Whatever. - That's it, thank you. Here we are. So, finally happened. God, why are we sitting like this? Hold on. [indistinct chatter] Yeah. This is better. Huh? How you doing? Eh... fine. Okay. Well, how did this happen? I mean, what changed your mind? Like, why did you break up with Kerem? Why did you decide to go with me? Kerem... Kerem can be... too aggressive. You can't get close. Just like fire, she'll burn you. - Am I making sense? - We understand. Who is this guy? - Doesn't matter. - She can be such a fucking psycho. I'm losing it. You know what I really want to do? Fuck someone up. Couldn't hurt to loosen up a little bit, right? But... how do I explain this? It's hard to breathe sometimes. I don't know. Because I really feel something. Can't help how you feel, can you? But I never wanted anything like this before. So maybe we should cancel the order, huh? Come on. - What the fuck? - I understand what you mean. I don't know why you're leading me on like this. But you wanna know something? - This isn't over. - What did you just say to me? I'm saying you can't play games with people's emotions like they don't matter! You actually think you're better than everyone. Eda, the hottest girl in school! Serves me right, I guess, falling for a bitch like you. - Fuck you! Nobody talks to me like that! - Why don't you go back to that thug? You're both so fucked up, you deserve each other. I'm not gonna sit back and get fucked with. I'm gonna make you pay for this. What the fuck are you looking at? Mind your own fucking business! [Işik pants] Sorry, Eda. Student Council ran late. But I have some baklava we can take. Eda... So you know there's that one thing. The thing you want most. You need to just go for it, no matter what. Even if it's gonna hurt you. If not, you'll never know for sure. Are you okay? [seagulls crying] Just a shit day. Let's get out of here. So, we just came to congratulate you. Turns out you're leaving for a very good reason. [Burcu] Yeah, it's nice of you to stop by. All of us are still a little upset. I hate that we'll go through our last year without you. Me, too. - [sighs] - We're not doing this right. What do you mean? You're going to be gone soon, changing your whole life forever. I just feel like drinking tea doesn't really fit the occasion. Let's get some booze in here and celebrate this thing right. That's not a bad idea. Let's do it. Um, you know what? I have some wine left over from the party. - But... But I don't... - It's a great idea. Let's have some fun. [Burcu and Eda chuckle] Işik, dear, you don't have to drink if you don't want to. Oh, no way. She's drinking, too. You need a way to loosen up! Why go through life sober when you can drink alcohol? [chuckles softly] [both chuckle] All right, drink up. [chuckles] Thanks for coming over. I really needed this. Should I put on some music? - Mm-hmm. - [Burcu] Yes. [music playing] So do you really love him? Who told you that? You got engaged, yeah? Oh... Hmm. Yeah, I did. So you're in love. You're like head over heels. I have a question for you. Are you actually qualified enough to have fallen in love? If you're not, you might mess it up. Take my word for it. [chuckles] How do I know if I'm qualified enough? Having enough love for yourself is the most important. You have to accept who you are. You go into love without that part, and all you've done is waste your time. You can mistake that relationship for the real thing and hang onto it long after you should have let go. For example, assuming you love someone just because they say they love you. Uh... That... makes a lot of sense. You're onto something. Okay, then, if that's true, is this the relationship that you really want? - Is this the real thing? - Is he a good man? You don't want to spend the rest of your life with someone you don't think is a good person. - That would be horrible. - You know... maybe. Who can say what makes someone good? You know, some people think Eda's bad. Kerem is bad, Osman and Sinan... But you don't think they're bad. So is goodness just what a majority of people agree with? And what if your heart disagrees with them? There are no answers, but how can you love someone without one? I mean, does this guy blow your mind? I think you know what I mean. Exciting in all the right ways... [Işik] Don't forget about intelligence. I don't see how it works if you can't respect their mind. Well, of course. No one likes a stupid man. I think it's time to open another bottle. [chuckles] [mellow music playing] I used to think I'd figure things out eventually. I thought that as an adult, I'd have all the answers. But that just isn't how life works, I'm sorry to tell you ladies. [sighs] [sighs] You run into one person... and they ruin the whole system you built for yourself. And what's worse is you realize the whole system you built was wrong all along. You have to admit, "I believed in entirely all the wrong things." How do you know when it's time? What forces you to finally admit it? [chuckles] There comes a moment... when something happens to you that makes you feel like you're truly alive for the first time. And then everything in your life turns upside down. Well, I'm the worst example of anyone here. I can't even live up to my own truth. We only get to live one life. One chance to get it right. I don't want to mess that up. - You wanna know what I think happiness is? - I'd love to know. I hope you're about to spell it out for us. Can you love yourself? Can you accept you're worthy of everything? Being able to say, "I'm alive. There's only one me." As long as you don't hurt someone, as long as you don't hurt yourself, what's holding you back? Maybe we don't think that we deserve it. Hm. Maybe we don't love ourselves enough. We're leaving. Come on, Eda! - What? - Where are we going? - To Sinan's. Now, let's go. - Okay. [Burcu] Uh... Ah! I almost forgot. We found Mr. Altuna's coat. We were gonna return it to him, but you can give it to him instead.

Forget about her for a second. - Let's go out on the boat. - That's a great fucking idea, dude. Yes! - Kerem, a little faster, man. - [Kerem] Oh, fuck off. [Eda] Woo! Hold on. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm going to make a speech. I say, never forget. Whatever the outcome is, even if we get kicked out and get fucked up, let's remember... this fucking beautiful night. Maybe it's our last great night, huh? [Osman] That's probably true. Who knows what the fuck will happen to us. Life is crazy long, and we were screwed from the beginning, right? [all laughing] Ah! I forgot my birthday party! [metal clinking] [balloon pops] I can't believe it. I thought you guys didn't care about birthdays. We knew it was important to you, so we made an exception. Blow it out. I'll tell you what I wish for. Even if it's 20 years from now, I hope you guys are still in my life. You all really mean a lot to me. Let's promise to reunite 20 years from today, no matter what happens to us. Yeah, okay, we'll do it. Now cut the sappy shit, and blow it out. [horn sounds] - [Işik screams] - [Sinan] Oh shit.
