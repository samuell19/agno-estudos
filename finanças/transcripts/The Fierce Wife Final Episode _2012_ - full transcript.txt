An-Zhen! 2012 Summer Get up! Quick! Get out of bed! Hurry up! Wu Yu-Meng, are you ready? Ah... Oh... Mommy, my sock has a hole! Hurry UP! Mommy. Another one. Mommy. You're going to work in your slippers? Mommy, hurry UP- I'm running late. My name is Hsieh An-Zhen. I got divorced 4 years ago and have remained single since. Wen Rui-Fan is my ex-husband, the man who had hurt me most. Lan Tian-Wei is the man who taught me how to recover from trauma. Li Wei-En is my cousin and the woman who wrecked my marriage. Rui-Xuan and Kang-De are my good friends and the family who always support me. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. Hi. Hello. Ma'am... We have trouble upstairs. What's up? Please come with me. You know what service means? I'm just a hotel worker. Not a relationship expert. Please don't be angry. When you're angry, you'll look ugly and graceless. You'll have wrinkles and look old. Have some water, Mrs... Mrs...what? Ma'am. Hsieh An-Zhen. Ai-Lin. Assistant manager? You're a super woman now. Don't make fun of me, please. Oh, my country. Easy to bid farewell to. Hard to be reunited with. Poetry has become part of your life! Well... Forget it. You know the rat hole I lived in... I was bored to death. So I read classical poems to pass the time. But at least you have your husband. Did he come back with you this time? Husband? You mean ex-husband? Ex... It wasn't his fault. It was mine. Marriage feels like a harbor to me. But I really miss the storms over the sea. In fact, I don't need security. I'm a... ...selfish... ...dissatisfied... ...and wild woman. You're not selfish at all. If it wasn't you back then... Who are you seeing? I don't know. You don't know? But I do. With the ex, you feel familiar and safe. But the wound still hurts. With the new lover, you feel excited and happy. But the adventure frightens you. Am I right? Oh, right. I'm flying away tomorrow. Where are you going? I'm going to where he is. Although I don't know who he is. But the point is to go on an adventure. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. This is the Captain speaking. We're flying at an altitude of 30,000ft above sea level at a speed of 800km/hr. It's12o'clock at noon in Taipei. We're scheduled to land at Taoyuan International Airport in two hours. Thank you again for choosing China Airline. We wish you a pleasant journey. Thanks. Excuse me, are you happy with our new Michelin-starred meal? Very happy- Thank you, Mr. Lan. This is the duty-free item you ordered. Thank you. You're welcome. This is the limited edition we launched after we joined the Sky Team. It symbolizes the dream of traveling around the world. You can give it to your family or girlfriend as if taking them around the world. Jane. I understand how you feel. I know Now you're waiting for my answer. This is the answer I give you. Is it a good idea? Of course! You!? What are you doing here? Ma'am. Happy birthday, ma'am! Happy birthday, ma'am! Thank you so much. Right, let me make a wish. Hmm... l hope everyone is happy and content. Ma'am, who will you spend the night with? With my daughter, of course! Look, here you are. It's from a friend of yours. She says you have to open it right now. Really? Okay- Happy Birthday! Hsieh An-Zhen! Since I'm so clever, I've got you a room, a dinner, and red wine. And something so special. Ha, ha, ha. It's a secret. Have a great time. Come on! Don't worry. I'll pick up Meng. Have a lot of fun! And... ...this too! Oh. Come on, let's go. Let's have cake. Okay- Let's go. An-Zhen, Life is full of accidents. Although we often get frustrated, but when we look up we see the boundless sky. What you can control is never let trouble get in your away. From Tian-Wei. Hello. Hello. Excuse me. Is An-Zhen here? Good evening. Ms. Hsieh... May I ask who you are? Ms. Hsieh has already left. I'm her friend. A very good friend. Mr. Lan. - Long time no see! - Hello. You're looking for Ms. Hsieh, right? Yes. I know where she is. Let me take you there. Yes, thanks. A very good friend? Who is it? Room Service. Oh Hi. This is for you. Thank you. Just one more thing. This is a gift. Happy Birthday! No! No! Come on, girl. Don't be shy. Gorgeous. Take it easy. Come. Come to me, babe. Stop! Stop! Stop! No. Come on! Don't be shy. No. Stop! I'll call police. No! No! Wow. 3P Wen Rui-Xuan! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's alright. Excuse me. Mr. Fu. This is our latest model, Golf GTI. Of course, Mr. Fu, if you... Wow. You go to the gym, right? You're so strong. The color of the car is red... Hooray! I won! Just like you, Mr. Fu, it's full of passion! Yu-Meng, I'm so great! I won! I won! Yu-Meng I'm so great! I won! Whose kid is it? Someone take care of it! So noisy! It's my kid. Zhuang Zhuang. Zhuang Zhuang. Come to Daddy. I'm sorry. He's bit noisy. You know some clients are so thick-skinned. They thought we were running a nursery. I'm really sorry. Come on, let's carry on. Give it a try. Come on. I didn't call him! That's alright. Relax just for once. Why denying it? Hello, good evening. What should I do? So difficult to choose. Really? What's the difference between them? Of course they're all different! When I feel relaxed, I'd go for matcha cake. Chestnut if I'm busy. When I'm in a bad mood, it'll definitely be chocolate. As for today... Okay, I got it. Excuse me. I want this one. Okay, a classic strawberry tart. Please wait a second. Thanks. How do you know I want strawberry today? Because today... you're in a good mood. I thought we were going to dinner? Why did we come to your office? This is the showroom I designed. And today...you're my VIP Thank you. It's so nice. You can create a difference atmosphere in the same space. Just like you can have different relationships with the same people. But when it comes to service we must start from human nature. Only when we put ourselves in the clients' shoes can we make them feel they're the VIPs! Cheers! Here, congratulations! You got promoted again! But... I feel so tired. What's wrong? I don't want this kind of life anymore. I can never settle down in any place. If I could have a home... Ah... We almost forgot the cake! Ah...it's squashed. Leave it. Let's get another one. It's okay. It's still edible. Are you sure? It's as yummy as ever. Have a bite. You know I don't like sweet things. Come on, it's my birthday. Alright. Happy Birthday! Thank you. Hello. Happy Birthday. Thank you. Are you going to pick up Meng Meng? Yes, sure. I'll pick up Meng Meng. Okay. Please take care of the show. Okay. Okay, see you tomorrow. Bye bye. Okay, bye! Meng Meng This is a present for you. What should you say? Thank you. Don't you think she's too young for the book? Really? That's how the Germans teach their kids. Don't be so serious. This... ...is for you. I've got a present too? Thank you. It's very nice of you. Well, it's getting late. Go have a good rest. Right. If there is any problem with your room, let me know at any time. Yeah, I'll definitely let you know. Ms. Hsieh An-Zhen. Good night. Good night. An-Zhen, I know you always long for flying to a bigger world. I wish I could become the wings of yours. Tian-Wei. Here begins the Pistema product launch. With the new active ingredients from stem cells this luxurious skin care product could stop the skin's aging process and solve all other problems. Pistema can stimulate cells' ability to rejuvenate the skin. Let's welcome Whitism's deputy manager Mr. Wen Rui-Fan to introduce the product to us. Hello everyone. This product is designed especially for Asian women. It tackles all sorts of skin problems such as scars, fragile skin and the sensitive skin after surgery that needs special care. Women... They may have been hurt by love but their longing to be loved will never disappear with time. Don't ever let the scar stop you believing in true love. Give yourself another chance. You'll find that you deserve honesty and true love. It's just for you. Thank you. An-Zhen. Congratulations! The product launch is a big success. Thank you. It's all due to your help. Not at all. I was just doing my job. You've been looking after Meng alone in the past few years. I'll be transferred to Taipei next month. I'll help you then. Yeah. Four years. It's been four years. Look at you. In the past four years, you're completely changed. You've no desires. You're totally dedicated. Look at you! Look at what you've become. You could be the Most Outstanding Young Men or the Model Citizen of the Year! What? Tell me. How long do I have to wait? I've set my tempo pace. I don't want to press An-Zhen. Oh, my brother. I've told you. A real man must have guts. You want to wait with love and patience? No one follows such rules after WWII! It doesn't matter if she wants it or not. Force her. Play hard. Hey, you've been slacking off recently. Be careful or you won't get promoted. Don't you worry about me. Look at me. Now I'm the role model for modern men. I'm not after promotions. All I want is a happy family. What do you think? I'm still hot, right? Very hot. Now here comes the problem. While I become a good man, my wife is getting naughty. Your phone's ringing. Darling. Yes. No... I'm just chatting to your brother. Now... The most important thing in this meeting is to announce the Best Service Award. The award goes to Ms. Hsieh An-Zhen. Please come forward. Congratulations Thank you for your hard work. Ms. Hsieh. Sir. Congratulations! Thank you. Well, can you do me a favor? That's Director Hu's daughter. She began as a trainee today. She has some relationship problem recently. She behaves like a drama queen at home. Mr. Hu can't stand it anymore. So he sent her here. To see if she can get over with it. So I'd like you to help her. Sure, no problem. Good, I'll leave her to you. - I need to run. - OK - Congratulations. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. Do you have any expertise or interests? I'm interested in many things. Such as shopping, singing and dancing. And partying! Expertise? Does drinking count as expertise? I can finish a bottle of whisky. If it's beer, I'll never get drunk! Good, we're bound to get on with each other. Hey. You haven't shown me the other places. Let's go. Do you have any expertise or interest? I'm interested in so many things. Singing. Dancing. Partying- Drinking. I never get drunk! Ouch, it hurts! Then the next one... His name is Lan Tian-Wei. He works for Volkswagen Asia Pacific... Ma'am, ma'am! I'll definitely work harder to show you my effort. You're going to 25th floor? Me too! Hey, can I ask you a question? How old are you? Are you still single? How long are you staying? I think I'm not obliged to answer your questions. Hey, don't be so cagey! My boss says service should start from human nature. So please let me understand you more. Good. Please tell your boss I prefer to be left alone. No...I've been really busy. Really? Okay- I... I'll see to it. I'll ask someone else. Really, it's alright. Okay? Okay, that's it. Okay, bye. What's up? We have a new trainee. I have to give her extra training after work. I was going to ask Rui-Xuan to pick up Meng Meng tomorrow. But she... I'm free tomorrow evening. I'll do. You? Yeah. So the gist of this creative sales plan is to let the customers know what we sell is not only cars but good tastes. Discussion. Sales Department. Wen Rui-Xuan. Wen Rui-Xuan. What? Er... Director... Please make a conclusion for us. And tell me what the Sales Department thinks. First, I think what you said is great. Secondly, this plan will definitely be successful! Thirdly, I personally think... Enough! Sit down! In three days, every department, hand in a report to me. Dismiss. I'm sorry. You must be hungry. What you do fancy? My treat. Fried chicken and French fries. I hate arrogant adults most. I hate arrogant kids too. Kids aren't allowed to be picky. Eat up in 20 minutes. Or leave it. It tastes so disgusting. I thought you liked drinking? I guess it's your mood that makes it taste disgusting. It's the same with the attitude. Once you've got a right attitude, everything goes well, doesn't it? Then since I got dumped, what kind of attitude should I have? Put up with it. Dry your tears. Then put up with it. Life goes on. Work needs to be done. No matter how much you hate it, you have to face it bravely. Face it bravely? You've got 38 mins and 17 seconds left. Uncle Lan, do you have a girlfriend? What? You're so old. If you don't get married soon, no one would want you! Or? Or what? You like men? Tell you what. My daddy is going to be transferred back to Taipei soon. My family will be together again. You've got 35 mins and 58 seconds left. I'm back! Mommy! Mommy, you're back! Did you behave? Yes, I did. Really? Good that you got home safely. I'm off. Thank you. It looks she's had a great time. Yeah. But you must be worn out. Not really. I'm alright. I'm not a good mother. I've always been busy. Now I keep working extra time. If... I tell you I'm happy to help you look after Meng Meng? 1. Keep your temper. 2. Listen patiently. 3. See the world from her height. Bull shit. Meng Meng Today... Let's have fried chicken and French fries. Okay? Fried chicken. 1,2,3. Ha, ha, ha. The new concept for this season is... That's the topic for the next meeting. Today... Let's carry on. Hey. What exactly is Lan Tian-Wei to you? Well, a bit closer than a good friend. Good friend? A good friend would look after your kid? Wow, so nice. Why do I never have such a good friend? An-Zhen. It's been four years. Four years. Don't you want another man? Don't you have any desire? An-Zhen, the Puritan! What? Tell you what. Lan Tian-Wei is like the premium steak. Like this. Premium steak. If you don't be careful, any young girl out there would snatch him from you! Yes, right. I think it's there. It leaks from there. Hello. Nice to see you again. Leave the stuff there and you can go. Thanks. Hey. Your room is really big and comfortable. Are you happy with it? Ouch! Tell me. What's the 8th rule in the employees' manual? Do not disturb guests. Do not abuse the rights to enter the guests' rooms. Hey. I'm already off work. Besides, I was helping my co-workers to bring him the food. It doesn't matter if you're working or not. To respect the guests is the most basic rule. Ms. Hsieh, didn't you ask me to have a right attitude? This is my attitude. I let the guests feel they're VIPs. And they enjoy the pretty sight of me. You... I think you don't understand what I mean. Ms. Hsieh, you're not interested in Mr. Lan, are you? Oh. Your skin looks alright. But it's bit dehydrated. Fine lines are so visible. It's droopy! Exercise. Wait. I'm not... You want to be my opponent? You need to work harder. An-Zhen. Come on! Thanks. You look very beautiful today. Thank you. 2000 Bordeaux... It was a good year for the grapes. So the wine has a unique flavor and excellent texture. Wow. Why did you suddenly ask me out to eat? Recently... you've been looking after Meng Meng for me. So of course I should treat you. Thank you. An-Zhen. Zoe. You...What are you doing here? I saw you outside the restaurant. So I followed you in. I'm so hungry. You don't mind me joining in, right? To be frank, l do mind. Don't be like this. Bordeaux! It tastes so good. Right. Check in. 1,2,3. Zoe. Come with me. Zoe, if you're having lunch with friends and someone suddenly interrupts you, how would you feel? Making another friend... Why not? But have you ever thought if the others want to make friends with you? It's just a lunch. Why are you making such a fuss? You can't see everything from your point of view. It's the same with serving the customers. But I never want to serve the customers! I'm impressed by your courage in pursuing love. But if you could apply it to work, wouldn't it be better? An-Zhen, you can never shut up about work. I guess you love working so much, right? But I don't want to work at all. All I want is to fall in love. So, please let me have Mr. Lan, okay? No way! I see. Good, you have guts. Do you dare to challenge me? Come, another around! Ms. Hsieh. Save your energy for looking after your kid. Don't waste it on fighting for a man. He's my man in the first place! Who says he's your man? Look carefully. It's written on my face. He's mine. Ms. Hsieh. Don't hang in there. Come on! So much left! I need to go to the restroom. I'll come back to it. Oh... You lost! You lost! You lost! Zoe Hu! Coward. Ma'am. Ma'am. Are you alright? Are you okay? I'm fine. Here. This afternoon... There is a VIP event at 4:30, right? Is the food ready? Yes, it's all done. It's too dangerous for you to pour hot water. Give me the tea pot. Let me do it. No. My daddy is coming back to Taipei next Monday. I'm learning to make his favorite tea. Stop pestering. Please, help me just once. Please. Please. Okay then. Do it yourself. But be careful. Yes, press it hard. OK! Yes, that's right. Harder. Ah, it really hurts! Meng Meng Come. Where? Meng Meng Does it hurt? Are you alright? How did it happen? What happened? I was making tea. Why was she making tea? I just tried to let her... I'll take you to the hospital. Come, let me. No need. Can you stop asking everything to be so perfect? She's just a kid! Is it still hurting you? Mommy. What? Come. I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? In fact, it's not Uncle Lan's fault. It was my fault. That's alright. Broccoli. Er... I know recently... ...you've been helping... Broccoli! Hey. I'm sorry. I misunderstood you last time. Okay- Again. Actually, apart from saying thank you to you, I want to tell you I really like you. Wait. Excuse me. Hello. Yes, sir. Okay- Which floor is it? Okay- I'll be right there. Okay- Yes, yes. Okay, bye! Hey, look. She looks so radiant. Absent-minded. Absolutely no doubt about it. These are signs of a woman in love. I guess it must have something to do Mr. Lan. She desperately wants to hold on to something she can control. That could be her romantic relationship. So in the past two years we see so many people suddenly want to fall in love or settled down. I always feel it's the most beautiful when it's still ambiguous. - So you have to be patient. - Ambiguous... Because the fact is once there is no ambiguity, it's like you've boarded on the train. Then you move on to the next station and the one after. You begin to understand each other. You begin to show your true nature. So the game of occupying and being occupied begins. This is the worst part of a relationship. Hello. Yes, it's 9 tomorrow morning. Let's welcome Wen Yu-Meng. Good morning, miss. Good morning, everyone. My Ambition. My ambition is to become a scientist like Einstein to discover more interesting things in the world to help more people. And I want to follow my mother's example to find someone like my father who loves her so much and to build a very happy family. Daddy! Hey! You're back! I told you I'd be back to see you. I'd definitely be back to see you. Did you listen to Mommy? Yes. Let's go. Mommy. 1,2,3. Hello. Please have a look. These are perfect for weddings. Can I have a look of this? Sure. Thanks. Please have a look. Thanks. Doesn't it look so elegant? Daddy. I destroyed the enemy for you. You have to work hard too. Doesn't it smell so nice? Come on. Eat it. Mommy. Wow, it looks so yummy. Have you eaten? Not yet. Then join us. Have some squid. Mommy. Daddy mixes the curry sauce with rice. Let me get you some soup. I'll get the pepper- You're a big girl now. And you still want to sleep with Mommy? I want to you to tell me stories. But Granny, why did your eyes become so big? So I can see your face clearly. Then why did your eyes become so so so long? So I can hear your voice clearly. Daddy, stay with me. And Mommy too. I want both of you. Have you gone to bed? I want to see you. I've got something important to tell you. I can't talk right now. Would you please wait until tomorrow? You forgot this again. Tell me. Are you going back to Wen Rui-Fan? Then... Another question. Do you feel happy when you're with me? An-Zhen, I always know how I feel about you? And you? I... I really don't know. I feel...l might... Maybe I'm not ready yet. But I've been waiting for you for long enough. You? Do you have the courage to take a gamble again? Please... Let me prove my love for you. Tian-Wei. You really treat me like a princess. Thank you. Let's go. Let me take you somewhere. Are you regretting it? No.100, please go to Counter No.2. Thank you. Am I ready? Is this the happy ending? Or the beginning of another mistake? No. 104, please go to Counter No. 3. Thank you. We're nearly there. Can I go to the restroom? No. 105, please go to Counter No.8. Thank you. No. 107, please go to Counter No.4. Thank you. No. 107 No. 107 Hsieh An-Zhen. Hsieh An-Zhen. Hsieh An-Zhen! Hey. Move on. Mr. Wen, please check it. You've a sharp eye. It's our latest design. It means eternal love. Thanks. Excuse me. Thank you. It's so great! It's so great, isn't it? What kind of car is it? This is your order. Thank you for choosing our service. Hello everyone! Here comes Uncle Black Cat! YA! Who am I? Uncle Black Cat. It's me! Ladies and gentleman. Now I announce that Wen Yu-Meng's birthday party begins! It's starting! Nine years ago. On a very quiet night. Mama Meng's tummy began to hurt. Papa Meng jumped to his feet and took her to the hospital. After a 12-hr labor, Mama Meng gave birth to a very cute baby. Here you are! That was Little Meng. Little Meng cried a lot. Mama Meng was so busy looking after her. I don't cry a lot. YA! It's so great, isn't it? Okay- Thank you. No problem. I want to see it. Sure, look. Don't you look so handsome? Where? - So handsome, right? - Where? So great, right? Where? Here. Here it is. Watch out. Ou! Go play. Thank you. Thank you for being Oliver's dad. Although it's just an afternoon, he's very happy. You've changed a lot in the past few years. Really? You've become stronger. Don't they say a woman would become stronger when she becomes a mother? You'll be a good mother. I'm sorry, Rui-Fan. If it wasn't... Oliver is already three-years-old but he still can't say daddy. I wouldn't bother you if he could. Oliver Oliver, come over. I'm sorry. I never knew that there was Oliver. Can I do anything for you? I should be responsible for the result of my action. But... I'm Oliver's father. At least let me share some responsibility. Or let me make up for it. Make up for what? Make up for what is lacked in your conscience? Or what is lacked in my love? Rui-Fan, it's enough. You've got enough responsibilities. Oliver, let's go, right? Daddy, bye! Thank you. He can finally say daddy. Wen Rui-Fan. I must teach you a lesson today. What are you talking about? What makes you think you could teach me? Who do you love? An-Zhen or Wei-En? None of your business. Wen Rui-Fan. Make yourself clear. Get off. You can't leave like that. You can't leave before you make yourself clear. I haven't seen Wei-En for four years. Can't I do her a favor? Meng Meng You're our dearest darling. The little angel who brings us happiness. We wish you grow up healthy and happy. Daddy and Mommy will be caring for you, supporting you forever. Happy Birthday. In the photos we just saw they all looked so happy. Why? They're so close to each other but cannot go back to the old days? In our lives, there are so many things we feel we'll never forget. But as days go by, we just forget them. In the blink of an eye, we've all become old. Everyone, shall we let them start all over again? Yes! Daddy and Mommy start all over again! What? Zhuang Zhuang. Start all over again with a new mommy! Good! Ah, no... Don't talk nonsense. Meng Meng's daddy and mommy start all over again! I support Wen Rui-Fan. Wen Rui-Fan! Winner! Wen Rui-Fan! Winner! Wen Rui-Fan! Winner! Winner! Winner! Hey, are you and my brother cooking something up? Why didn't I know anything about it? Hush. Don't ask any question. Sit. Just sit and watch. Ladies and gentleman. Now, let's welcome our star! What? It's cake! Hey! Why it's you? It's the same, right? Not the same. Not at all! Let's be happy! Happy Happy Happy Happy So Hey, bro. What happened to you? Are you okay? OK The... Hey, come on. Now here comes the show! Let's count down! What? Count down? Hey, just do it. I... I... I... I... Daddy, bye! Let's have cake. Hooray! Come on! Come on! Come eat cake. Do you want cake? Yes! Let's sing Happy Birthday to Meng Meng, okay? Yes. Ready. Go! Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. I guess Rui-Fan doesn't have the guts to tell you. But I don't want to hide it from you. Because you were the kindest person to me in the world. Now, Oliver has got the memory of his dad. So it's time for us to go back to the US. Oliver. Let's go. Come, let's go. Wei-En, it's really difficult to raise a kid on your own. It's a hard job. No, it's not hard at all. A chocolate cake, thanks. It's so sweet. Mr. Lan, would you like a cup of tea? No, thanks. We use only white roses for the wedding. Hey, Ms. Hsieh is here. If you miss him, go to him. Go to him. And then? Then? Then...nothing. Just put on the happy ending show. What is a happy ending? You get married. Then gradually you discover he's not what you imagined in your mind. Hey, you know why among all those men I chose no one but Kang-De? The reason was simple enough. I feel most relaxed and I can laugh out loud when I'm with him. There are pros and cons to everything. It depends on how you strike a balance. I often fight with Kang-De. But we forget it as soon as it's over. But... If you keep fussing over trivial things... Or see everything through a magnifier then one day everything will become a big problem! But why I'm still so afraid? You worry about the future every day. But how about the present? Laugh out loud when you're happy. Then cry your eyes out when you're upset. You... You always make things so complicated. My good girl. You've been through a lot. It's been so many years. Now the most important thing is to face your heart honestly and grab happiness in your life. That's what we call courage. Hey. Don't tell Kang-De anything I said about him just now. Or that idiot would be so smug. No, I won't. Hey, Hsieh An-Zhen! You're still in bed? It's afternoon! I got a couple of days off. Days off? Something terrible happened! Hello! Hello! How about chocolate? But they come in different packaging. You decide. Bride's privilege. You're so sweet! You're drinking like a fish. Can you walk on the red carpet in such a mood? Hello. Hsieh An-Zhen, did you hear me? Lan Tian-Wei is getting married! Did you hear me? Remember. You have to grab happiness in your life. Now the most important thing is to face your heart honestly and grab happiness. This is what we call courage. Do you have the courage to take a gamble again? The point is to go on an adventure. Daddy. Get down. Get down. Please look after Meng Meng. Mommy, where are you going? Meng Meng Weren't you always a good girl when Daddy wasn't home? Now... Mommy... Mommy just... Meng Meng, do you want Mommy to be happy? But if you don't let go of her hand, how could Mommy be happy? You've always looked after me, looked after Meng Meng. It's time for you to pursue your happiness. Off you go. Go. Mommy. An-Zhen. Good luck. - Excuse me. - Hello. Is there any flight to Guam? Let me check for you. Thank you. There are seats available on Flight Cl 226. I can check you in right now. Thank you. Hope I can make it. Ms. Hsieh. Your boarding pass. - It's gate D5. - OK. Have a safe flight. Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me. Where is the church? That way. Okay- Thank you. That way. Haven't seen you for ages! Congratulations! Thank you. Wow. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Kim. Hello, welcome. Sorry. You know... Ah, no... The...the... Wedding. Wedding! Where? I can speak Chinese. Whose wedding are you going to? I...l want to... I want to ask about... Mr. Lan. Okay, wait a second. Lan Tian-Wei! Can you see his name? Yes. There is a Mr. Lan. But the wedding has already begun. Where is it? That way. Thank you. She looks so beautiful. Wait! An-Zhen. You're mine. I didn't turn you down. How can you do this to me? She's my cousin. Cousin again? Why a cousin again? Why a cousin again? Wait. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I just thought I'm the star today. But the wedding is thrown into chaos even before I arrive on the scene. Her eyes are large and fierce. But they're red with tears. Girl, where do you come from? Who on earth do you want to scare? Who are you? Right before my eyes. This tall woman asks angrily, Who on earth are you? The groom frowns and asks her, Who on earth are you? I've been acting for ages and you haven't laughed yet. You're really the most difficult audience I've ever met. Okay, how about this? A new number. If this is love, it feels like a dream when you wake up. If this is love, I'm willing to go traveling. Enough. Stop it. I haven't finished the last note. Ah... Forget it. Forget it. Cousin, good luck! I'm the groom. Good, good. Thank you. Thank you. It's very moving. Er... I'd like to introduce ourselves to you. She's the bride. I'm the groom. What are you two doing here? I'm sorry. Sorry for keeping everyone waiting for my wedding. Finally, it's time to begin. We're gathering here today to celebrate one of life's greatest moments. You must take me to see the world. Of course. Broccoli, do we have to get married? What do you think? After this experience I finally come to understand love doesn't have an expiry date. Marriages don't come with guarantees either. But that doesn't mean we can't grab happiness right now. After all, as long as you open your arms, you can embrace the whole sky. Actually, it's not that difficult to find a man who brings you happiness. The old lady at the bar! Can your body still move? Strip. Strip. Strip. Strip. Strip. It's fine, An-Zhen. I admit defeat, alright? Zoe, why aren't you in uniform? I come to hand in my notice. Why? Because I finally understand your words. I want to show him that without him I still have a life of my own. And it's even more colorful. Take care. An-Zhen, remember to grab happiness in your life too. Listen to me. Men have to be fed well at home. Or he would go out for snacks. You need to keep changing the menu. Forget about the cute ones. We need to push up your A cups. Hey. They're bigger. Bigger? I'm being polite to call them A-cups. Who doesn't know you're a double A-cup? Well, has Mr. Lan turn vegetarian recently? Look! They all look great on you! As long as you put it on, I promise... It really matters... Wait for me. Wait a second. Come on, yummy roast chicken. Please try it. Yummy roast chicken. Please try it. Thank you. Did you see that guy? Which guy? I feel... ...he's tastier than chicken. Don't be ridiculous! Hey, you don't understand it. Calm down. Behave yourself. Hello ladies. Please try it. Oh, thank you. Excuse me. What are you doing? I haven't had enough yet. You're such a bad example. Stand upright. An-Zhen, it's so pretty. I'll get it for you. My treat. Please don't. Don't waste your money. I'm goooooing back! Disgusting. Dirty. It's really weird. It's not for you. It's the special edition for An-Zhen. What? What do you want? Ultra-thin? Yes, I got it. We'll put it on tonight. Of course. I remember. Wow. It's so boring. L-Kang-De Darling.
