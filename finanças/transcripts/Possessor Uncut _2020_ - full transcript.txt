I didn't think that they would stay so long. Then ask him to leave. Girder, hi, I'm Vos, I just wanted to apologize. Yesterday I was not in myself ... I guess I didn't share enough when we took the test. Anyway, I'm ready now ... Call me. Yes, please call me. Who was? Work. I will have to travel again. - I thought they would give you some respite. - Yeah ... Something else has come up. I want you to come back to live with us. I hate all this. Tas? Tas? Am I predicting you? I'm getting old. By now I barely recognize myself. I'm too old for the car, I can't stand the tension. And the more time passes, the more important it becomes for me to find a replacement. And it would be you. Usually I don't misjudge people. It would be great. You have a very special nature. You find out when you work hard with someone. Yet still now, I can see a small thread that comes out of your skull connecting to a life that I thought you had already abandoned. Sometimes it only takes this to lose control, that little thought, a small fracture. I want to show you some photos of things they don't have worked with work with Holly Burgman.

Absent mother. No brothers. Spend cocaine for a few years, then fall in love and engages with one of his wealthy clients, Ava Parse. Daughter of John Parse of Zoothroo. Zoothroo? Data extraction. A great company outside the United States. The venue is local. But our deal is with Reid Parse's stepson, John's stepson. And what is the narrative? Imagine Collin Tate as the unstable lover who feels diminished by his new family. Ava has all the power in the relationship and is castrating him, so start using drugs again, becoming even more unstable. And in the end he freaks out, kills John, kills Ava and commits suicide. With Ava out of the game, Reid inherits everything, becomes CEO, cries for the cameras, a simple tragedy, nobody will ask questions. becomes CEO, cries for the cameras, a tragedy, nobody will ask questions. The pay is respectable. A shower of money. But the real goal, according to the corporation, it is the zoothroo itself. Because when we have Reid, we will have the Company. Sure. Ok, when do you start? Problems? No problem. I'll prepare it by going to the airport. Well. How long do we need? About four hours to prepare it. - And you? - I'm ready, I'm fine. I'd like to remind you before I start. After the initial connection you will be trapped, not you will be allowed to lose control during this performance. The deadline for completing the mission will be John Parse's dinner. It is scheduled for the day after tomorrow evening. You have to use this time to deal with Tate's instability. Dr. Mallasus has set up his compatibility just three days, so there is no room for error.

Use the calibration device at least once a day, use it more if you suffer from persistent disorientation. Mr. Tate's girlfriend is Ava (Eva) not Ava. He suffers from irritable bowel. If you will have intense pain on the right side of the abdomen will be considered normal. System synchronization will destroy memories of the murder ... The respiratory threshold is normal. How are the levels this time? The levels are good, Keep me in depth, so there won't be any problems. Of course Mrs. Vos, I'll keep you pretty deep. Make sure you pull the trigger when you're done. And what the fuck does that mean? Go on. Ok ... Interface activated and we are at full power. It could be a somewhat abrupt jump. Just do it. As you wish. Can you heat the water for me? Sure. You have a good perfume. I need a shower. You are not in a good mood today. Have you seen my supplements? Supplements? There were proteins in a box. I'm going to make damiana tea. You will like it, it is an antidepressant. I haven't seen them. I didn't hear you come back last night. I haven't been able to take a flight before. I have not slept almost anything. How was your trip? Exceptional ... the demonstration of the new program was impressive. He liked the construction game in Ebonics. How did the rest of the shift go? What's wrong with you today? What do you mean? What do you mean? You are not... You are strange with me. Good morning. Mr. Tate. This week I want it on curtains and shutters. The guide is already in your station. Tate. I've done it. I fucked her and it was incredible. Did you do it? You know what these East Coast girls are like. Foi revoltante, inhuman and e nunca serei perdoado. It was revolting, inhuman. And you? You managed to find the time to have fun on a parallel project? No, no, Eddie, what do you say? Good boy. I always thought it was your duty morals have sex with the boss's daughter. Brown curtains. Ring sockets. Standard bar. Not visible. Translucent shutters. White fabric. Is something wrong Mr. Tate? You are advancing like a snail. Focus. Sorry. Translucent curtains. Bar not visible. Vos, please connect. I'm here. What happened? What do you mean? Your levels were too high and I couldn't find you. Nothing. I was on the spot I couldn't answer. - Were you at Zoothroo? - Yup. I have just started my current shift. Everything seems perfectly normal. No interference. I do not understand. Maybe you need to talk to the new technician. He would probably take a look at the controls. The levels were sketched. I'm having Dr. Mel do it a deeper analysis. But I want you to let me know if notice something, anything. We can not afford no mistakes this time. Don't worry, I have everything under control. Hey, Tate. Everything good? Yes why?238 They say you are .. ran away from the place. - You do not look good. - I'm fine. If you say so. Some of us will call to negotiate on Saturday. And I'm sure your name is high on the list. But I guess you don't like the boss. - Where have you been? - I do not know sorry. I forgot that the alarm clock was off and I had to be late for work. You could have texted me. I was going to call the police. Sorry. Come and make a line with us. I see you well, Collin, a splendor. - Stop that. - You don't have to stop. I'll tell you if you have to stop. Well, I don't need to behave well, it's part of my fucking nature. Let's celebrate Moira's promotion to Zoothroo. - Do not say anything? - In Zoothroo? Pleased to meet you. We already know each other. It wasn't an apparently memorable encounter. When do you start? Yesterday. Ava told me that you are downstairs. - Why do you want that job? - Ava's father gave it to him. Your father is a sadist. Right on the floor where the employees they are more exploited. My father has a habit of submitting my boys to these tests. In this case... I know the psychic scars Colin's will prove his innocence. Sorry, Ava, but why don't you tell the old man to go fuck and then you go? Colin? Who's this? I guess his mind has to go off somewhere time after thus violating the lives of others. Seriously, how many pussies do you see at do I work every day? - Reeta ... Well ... I can only imagine the stuff he sees over there. I masturbate every day in front of the webcam. I bet they also know the brand of my vibrator. We know and ... now you can stop. Sorry. What are you doing? I wipe my hands. I missed you. Can we be friends again? Ava doesn't care. Yes sure. Well. I'll call you when I get back from Chicago. Sorry, I didn't think they would have stayed so long. It does not matter. What's happening to you? I'm fine. I'm just tired. And for this? You seem so down lately. I was afraid I had done something. You don't have to keep this job if it's not good for you. I'm fine. I swear, I'm fine. Good answer... I mean... Fuck! Fuck, Colin! No need to talk about it, but sometimes it's difficult, I'm not asking for much ... Just normal communication. - Ava. I'm falling apart. I love you. I love you too. Girder. Girder please respond. - Vos, situation? - Normal I'm taking control of the body. What about Melis? The analysis is inconclusive, very strange. Don't be so worried. I just wanted to check on the guest, now I feel it ... perfectly. Also, Parse's dinner is tonight and I'll be out in 24 hours. Okay. I want you to recalibrate, adjust on: 131451280R Walter Benjamin once wrote: "Boredom is the bird that hatches the egg of experience" My dear friends and allies, I would like to start the evening saying ... that you're bored. I'm bored... ... because you are all so ... perfect. And our operation has become so ... perfect. And I found myself with nothing to do, nothing to worry about. And in my boredom, I made a brood and from this comes the next phase in the evolution of our work. To boredom! To boredom! - Are you ready? - Sure, why shouldn't I? You know, I love my father, but it is atrocious. - He's a great man. - It is not. I don't even know if he's human. I think it's a huge pile of meat that feeds on misery. Pope? Honey, what boy did you bring home. - Good evening, Mr. Parse. - Yup... We were talking about psychology of failure as a father. You start accepting it when you realize that there is nothing you can do about it. Even Mr. Oiko has daughters. - Alex. - Collin. Collin works for me now. Yes, I ... I got him a job that, hopefully, it will not go beyond its capabilities. Are you doing well, Collin? - Everything good. Thanks. - Very well. Let me know if it gets too difficult for you. I need a drink. Wait here. I will be right back. - I'm on the spot. - Well. I want it to start tonight a quarrel with Parse. Get thrown out of the party. Something blatant. And later you come back, and let's finish the job. All clear? - Are you OK? - Oh sorry... - Want another drink? - No, that's okay. Can I help you? I have a feeling you owe me an apology. Ah! And why? I have a hunch. Folks, my future son-in-law. We're having a conversation, Collin, then why don't you go fuck yourself in a corner? Do it for me.352 I will only go away when Ava he will have sucked my cock properly. That's enough.... Do you think you can step on me? I am a giant! I'm a fucking giant! - Get him out of here. - Fuck you, bitch! Shit. - I don't think I can go home tonight. - Stay here. Your room is just waiting for you. Yes but I don't think it helps. Such a cold bed ... Unbearable. I go to bed. Why don't you fuck your mother in Dubai. "Dubai and goodbye". What are you doing here? This is... Get out. Get out before I call the police. Why don't you throw me out? I'm drunk. I go to bed. Get me out. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Get me out! Get me out! What happened? It is emerging. No. There is physical damage to the implant. Fuck! Your agent is stable, but not responding. It seems that it has not been able to maintain control over the guest. What about Tate? Hard to say. Now we are tracking him as the dominant body. But I see how to get out of the situation. See if he can find his way of the return and to finish the job. There is already some degree of permanent damage. The longer it stays, the greater the risk to your brain. She stays inside. Mr. Tate, Is it there? We should say two words. Yup? Hey, what are you doing here? Sorry, damn it ... I did it, so you know, we can be together. Thing? What have you done? I was ... I was angry. - They attacked me, I was just defending myself. - What you say makes no sense, Colin. I'm staying with Michael. Who is Michael? Fuck, you're bleeding. Sit down, come on. Sit down. Oh yes, I stumbled upon coming here.408 I banged my head. Yes, well, you'll have to go to the hospital, because you probably have a concussion. No, I'm fine. - Sorry if I scared you. - Scared? Here. Do you want some water, or gin? Water and gin, that's all I have. I was getting ready to go to the airport. - Chicago? - Hm, hmm. We should meet when I get back. Ava and I fought. Can i stay here? I can't go home. Poor little one! Okay, two nights. Leave the key on the desk when you go out. I am going to take a shower. Thanks. Treasure. Treasure. Of course honey. I'm hungry. Definitely hungry. Colin? Now let's get to the news of the conditions by Johnathan Parse, who is stable, but ... it is not yet confirmed what it has left with significant brain injury ... in a shocking attack that left Mr. Parse. in critical condition and killed his daughter. The paramedics arrived just in time ... Who is it? Who is it? Tate? Tate? Eddie? Come on let me in. Hey, look ... Poor guy ... - What are you doing here? I heard you had an accident and I came to see how you are. - How did you know I was here? - Reeta called me. - Do you know Reeta? - Sure. Hey, give me a drink. Yup. Vos, Vos. Hey, let's go back. I have suppressed the guest and we will have control for a while, but we have to move fast before the effect wears off. Hey, hey! Calm down, Girder sent me! - Girder? - I was undercover. Did not you know? I'm a collaborator, I was part of the deal. Here we go. Here it is. I've heard a lot about you. The great Tasya Vos is an honor. - I was a big fan of stabbing by Elliot Matza. - Eddie? - Ahead. I can't pull the trigger. - Oh, no, no. I am a Christian. And then Girder said you have to be you kill Colin. A public thing, no questions. I'm here to take care of your head. I don't have complete control at the moment. That's why I'm here. Come on, we don't have much time. Ok. Here we go. Let's check the sync first. You will see a series of images. Look at them and answer my questions. - Do you see a fox or a bird? - Fox. - A fish or a snake? - A fish. - Mouse or dog? - Mouse. Well. See the right animals, as they say. Now I will do a pulse analysis. You may feel a little uncomfortable, but you have to keep breathing normally. Ready? Eddie? Eddie? Eddie? Fuck. Ah, shit. No... Whore. You want to shoot. Just do it. Just do it! Just do it! Hi honey. Treasure. Hi honey ... Treasure. Hi, honey. Ah, Michael. I'm starving... I'm starving... Hi. What do you have there? - A map. - A map of what? - Take me to a place I discovered yesterday. - What's your name? - Wrath. Anger. I think I met you somewhere. Is that your house? Anger! Yup. - Michael? - Yup? I am a friend of your wife. I'm a friend of Tas. - Im very sorry... - Hi. - Tas no longer lives here - I do not know... - He wanted me to tell you something, I can ... - Maybe later, it's late ... Where is it? Where's your wife? Where is it? -I swear, I don't know! - Sit down, put your hands on the table. - Hands on the table! - Work, I don't even know if he is still in the Company. You know me? You know me? I need to know what he did to me, understand? I'm sorry. Tell me what it is and maybe I can help you. Have you ever thought of your wife as a predator? Have you ever seen it that way? - I do not know... Do not look at me. Keep your head down. - Have you ever thought about parasites, with cats? - Thing? Think about it. One day your wife is cleaning the cat litter and a worm enters it. And this worm ends up in his brain. And then he ends up having access to his ideas. And then you don't know if the ideas they are yours or the worm. And it makes you do things. Terrible things. And then you start to understand that he is no longer the same person. He is no longer the person he was. Start by asking yourself if you married her or the worm. See, damn bitch? I'm doing. Come out or do it! - What do you do here? - Tas. I was looking for you. - I wanted to talk. - Why? - What you did to me? - Done? - You're in control. - No. I have never been in control of myself. Now you have it. Where's Ava? Where's your loved one? Do you remember? - No, it wasn't me. - Yes, it is. Poor Michael. I loved it.527 But I'm not sure it was me. I will kill him. Fix it all or I swear I'll kill him. Forward. Just do it. You will get it all back. It's what you've always wanted. Get me out. Get me out. - You need to take a break. - No, let's finish. Ok. This is my grandfather's pipe. He died before I was born. My father gave it to me. Well. Next one. This is also mine. I killed her and kept her when I was a girl. Very well.
