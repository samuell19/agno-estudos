Going somewhere? Just... Larry is writing again. Follow me. - You see this house? - I see it. It's formerly an orphanage for the Irish. - You've been in Ireland, Shiela? - I have not been in Ireland, sir. - Never flown on Aer Lingus. - No. Well, the stewardesses aboard an Aer Lingus flight are not much to phone home about. But if you ever find yourself on a 9:00 a.m. to Dublin out of NYC, don't hesitate to ask for Millie. Millie? Former wife and mother to my very first test tube baby. Ten years a model for Irish men she was. Mm. Irish met the cigarettes? Ten years a model. Oh, yeah. A model. Buzz her on a 9:00 a.m. to Dublin out of NYC, and say, "Busner says, 'Hi.'" "Busner says, 'Hi.'" Busner says, "Hi," and she'll let you smoke... - ...in the lavatory. - I don't smoke. The French are coming. What's the modern day? Not five hundred years from now. You could have vision, Shiela. It's my jazz. You've got to have vision. Larry? Larry, my boy. Oh, he has vision. He's got bad vision, wrong vision. Thinks he's been touched. Oh! Take a touched man before I dare a glance at the dead man. It's our spirit. I'm feeling inspired. I don't know. Get back out there, Shiela. Give Larry a pat on the back and tug him where it hurts. - Hmm. - Go on. - Jimmy, this is your fault. - Fuck you, Jerry. Fuck you. Take me out to the fucking desert. You know, you should be happy I brought you along. All right, all right. You should. Probably one of the Mars trains. The fucking train doesn't end. - Probably going to Mars. - It probably is. You know, where the fuck are we, Jimmy? - So this is the place, huh? - Yeah. On a scale from one to ten, how insane is he? More than you or I. I'm clinically insane. Yeah, we both are. So I was thinking, you spill the beans in paragraph one. You spell, "Casual genocide swirling in on monthly waves," but you say it in French. So, might sound cool. - I heard there will be dancing. - I heard that too. - I heard she's gonna dance us till we drop. - Hearsay. - The French are coming. - Hmm. "The French are coming. The French are coming." That's all they say. You know, I... I voyaged to the Middle East once. Uh... - Okay. How was it? - It was hard, you know. And the sand, it was, like, really coarse. Uh, but... But sonically, it was heaven, you know, just blue sky everywhere and sounds and... I don't know, it's like your forever nightclub, you know? It was cool. You got to go there one day. Morocco. June. 1969. That would've been my dream. - It's gonna have to be 2069. - Mm. You can't be living like that, in the past. I like you girls better than I do the boys. Where did you go to medical school, Doctor? Harvard, Yale College. An Ivy League? Is it true what they say? About the day at the barricades? Is it all true? I got to go. I don't believe he is who he says he is. What do you think, Ines? I think... ...let's keep our mouths shut till D-Day. Damn. Jimmy... ...it's murder and cop, then. Officer... Go ahead. - Mm. - ...across the street. Let's go. You know, the architecture in this town, it never ceases to amaze me. I'll lead. If this woman is who they say she is... ...we're dead. Shit, yeah. - You're kidding me. - I'm afraid I'm not. - You've got no leads? - Not a one. Then what the fuck are you still doing here? Nice house. Nice lady. Here on your dime. Here on your dime. That's what's what. You're new? You've never seen me before, and yet you're worried if he's new? What if I'm new too? - You're new? - Not in the sense you mean. - Looked pretty normal to me. - Yeah, he's pretty quiet. Anyways, Myra, obviously it's quite sad that your husband has been murdered for more than a year now. But I hope that you've realized that we didn't just come here for the purposes of a powwow, like we're doing now. Jimmy. All righty, then. Anyway, Myra, it seems to me that the disappearance of your husband has caused quite a boom in your business venture. If we can call the import and export of crack cocaine from Nigeria a business venture. It's business. I export by means of things of which I import. And she admits to the venture. Now tell me, Mrs. Gold, is it not strange to your virgin ears that your revenues have tripled ever since the, "Oh, so mysterious disappearance" of a so called - Mr. Gold? - He was a time suck. I pour all my angst into business. It's a coping mechanism... Grief 101. Yes. Don't I know it? Will that be all? - I'm sad, Jimmy. - I'm sad too, Jerry. And Dr. Busner says... ...that I'm clinically insane. Whatever that means. I... I think it... ...means you're insane. - Clinically. - Am I a fool? No, man. How could you be a fool in that coat? I mean, it is nice, isn't it? I got it, um, from Steve Harrington's blowout sale. I mean, before he got... He went to Coeur d'Alene. I mean, there's a lot of prime real estate there. - Think they need PI's? - I don't know, man. You don't know? What do you know, Jimmy? I know we're a couple of the best damn PI's this side since NAM. Since NAM? Since forever, Jimmy. Because we see things, Jimmy. We see things. And don't you take that for granted. I don't, baby, I don't. Is that Busner? Yeah. He says north. He says to head north. And keep our eyes peeled. So? I used to think all adult women were glamorous. Like in Sex and the City. That's not me, hon. I like your vest. - Well, T.J. Maxx. - Mm. Must have been quite a bargain. - I stole it. - Hmm. Is that how you get your kicks? Hardly the only way. Would you mind showing me how else you get your kicks? Do you have 20 minutes? Sure. Follow me. I just see... Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes! Door was open, baby. Writing? Haven't stopped. You're gonna make yourself sick writing all day. You woke up at 9:00 a.m. and made yourself a pizza, Shiela. Don't tell me how to live my life, I won't tell you how to live yours. Any idea when that door is coming? Supplier from Morocco had to hire a contractor from Dubai. Man's fee is 200K. Somewhere someone's waiting on a wire. Until then, I suppose... ...until Myra wills it. You have high hopes with this woman. I'm afraid she seduced me. She's like a Beetle. Or a Rolling Stone. I salivate. I simply don't know what to do. She told you to write this book? This text. Yes. - What sort of text? - Religious text. A tome for the eons. Something infinite. - Yes. Grand! - Mm. - Yes, grand. - Can I help? The ancient faiths of the world were written by one man, Shiela, solely inspired. Moses spoke to his bush. Mohammed spoke to the winds. Larry speaks to Myra from Geneva. She's from Geneva? - She has no accent. - Tell me, Shiela. If you were all-powerful, would you not remove your accent? I have no accent. Look at those girls from New Zealand. Do you think they're happy talking like a couple of dingoes? Dingoes are Australian. Don't you see? It's the same thing. I don't think New Zealanders would be too happy with this disdain you're putting on. Don't you talk to me about New Zealanders. This, this is a sacred space. I will not endure such... ...frivolity while I... How do I put this politely? Would you please get the fuck... fuck out? Fuck you. No. It's about us, isn't it? Who would read about us? It's about us. It's about all of us. The human race needs a spokesman. And I am that man. Perhaps... I could write a chapter about us. Air all our dirty laundry to the world? It won't be like that. I am writing for a post-cleansed world. I'm writing for a world free of guilt and shame, where I could share our story and share it proud. And the world... ...the world would read my tome. And they will say there, there with a hint of truth. Like in the tales of old. What language is that? "When the Tower of Babylon fell... ...the world descended into chaos, fell into chaos." From whence we came, lie the ruins of a thousand and one languages, dead to you, dead to me, dead to all of us. But I have been in contact with a higher power. I have tutored in the final tongue, the one true tongue. The holy tongue and that... ...that is the tongue which you read. Damn, boy! I'll leave you to it. I know you're testing me a lot. I know your tricks! We are a couple of dirty dogs, you and me. A couple of dirty, dirty dogs. I'll tell you something. Try as you might, I will not say, "Woof." Larry will not say, "Woof." Yes! What happened here? - Murder? - Is that the two greatest detectives in all of LA? Wednesday is my Jazz Day. I mainly file the classics. Your Herbie Hancock and all that. Your C. Parker, your M. Davis. The classics. Hey, I'm gonna investigate right over here. You like jazz, Jimmy? I don't know. Give this a listen. See you back in the castle. - Can I help you? - We're here to investigate a murder. - Here? - Yeah. Okay. I've been here all day, I haven't seen any murder. - Feel free to have a look around. - Oh, isn't that convenience? You guys are with Dr. Busner? I don't know what you're talking about, sir. I'm Detective Jimmy. This is my colleague, Jerry, also a detective with the LAPD. Special Unit. Busner sends his best. Anyway, sir, um, your accent. - I can't quite place it. - It's French. Ah, Oui. Are you here on business? - I don't believe in business. - Oh, he does not - believe in business. - ...believe in business. You idiots. I've got your leads. It's gonna give me coordinates. Oui. You're a good man. This place must have used to be one of those rave clubs. Yeah. Takes me back to Berlin. - The French flag. - Yeah. Now, you could sleep here, dance here. Bathroom is down yonder. Hip, hip, hip, hip. Inside, inside, inside. They're recruits. Budapest. Oui. You with Busner? Yeah. You don't remember me? No. Miss, if I may? What the fuck are you doing out here? - I'm Allison. - That's a great fucking name, Allison. But that doesn't answer my fucking question. Waiting for you. Federico. Hey. Hello. Was there a... Was there a murder in here? Not that I know of. Mm, just taking a little nappy-nap? Yeah. You, uh, live in this shack? I guess so. You ever wondered where it all went wrong? Every day. Are you LAPD? - Special unit. - Damn! Mm-hmm. You know, I got a hunch that you didn't make any contributions to the state last year. How much did you pay in taxes? I didn't. Figured. Well, no one's gonna miss you. Jimmy. Hey... Busner. Busner? You know, I was thinking, once this whole thing is over, we should all go grab a drink in my brother's bar in Paris. - Drinks on me. - Mm. You'll have to teach me to speak Italian. No, I thought I'd teach you Swedish, actually. - And she's got a sense of humor. - Nah! - I think you're funny, Myra. - Thank you. - I feel safe when I'm with you. - Okay. Can I ask you something? Sure. How do you do it with so many people and not feel... Like a slut? A bad person. A woman willeth what a woman wanteth. - What? - I'm unemployed, Ines. - I liked it. - I do too. Maybe in Europe, anything goes. - No, sweetie, it's not like that anymore. - But you are. It's true. You're like the Rolling Stones. If they were a woman and didn't play music. Did someone say Rolling Stones? I've got a couple of rolling stones of my own I'd like to share. Shut the fuck up, Larry. Americans. - Is that really her? - Yes. Why do you always have to be such a creep, Larry? I've got to lead my life on my terms, girls. On my terms. Perhaps, one day, you two will embrace yourselves the way that I have, both the good parts and bad. Is it loud? Yes. We have to go right now. I still haven't heard the voices. - Have you? - Of course not. Hey, hands up, Larry. Is there a problem, officers? Yeah. Where are the bodies? - Bodies? What bodies? - The three bodies. Charles Baum, Misha Evans, and Greg Stevenson. These names ring no bells. - Gentlemen. - Chief. - I hear there was a murder. - Yeah, three of them. Huh. - Did you know about this? - I did. Y'all did fine. Next time, I'm gonna need you guys to shoot Larry. Sir. We could kill him. Larry is a man of faith. He's certain there's an afterlife that awaits. - Is that so, Larry? - Don't worry about what Larry thinks. The edicts of Rome have arrived along with the ones from Dubai and Paris. It turns out, Larry... - ...is a great sacrifice. - Must feel good, Larry? Feels great. Larry, where do you want the bullet holes? I want 'em right in his head. Right directly in his head. It's gonna be dark, it's gonna be loud. - You're gonna need night vision glasses, obviously. - Hey, sign me up, Doc. It's gonna be your next site. So, how's the writing coming along, Larry? It's going good, Father. That's great. And the worship? I've never felt closer to God. Hey, Islam, huh? - Yeah, you got to give it a shot sometime. - You know, I might. Anybody seen Shiela? Last I've heard, she went for a walk. You should be nice to her. Is it not enough that I have loved her? Just be nice to her. Not everybody is as touched as you are. Everyone keeps saying I've been touched. 'Cause you have been. How were we, Doctor? At the shack. You guys were fine. How... how, where, what? "How were we on TV?" He means. You guys were great. The French people loved you. On TV? Je... Jerry. Hello. We all saw you execute Federico. I mean, you're a legend, man. Regular Robespierre. That sort of fame never fades, and you got it in spades. - Real detectives? - We were on TV, Jerry. Meeting in five. ...fucking yeah! - Can I help you? - We're related? What are you talking about? Myra says we're all one family. She's speaking metaphorical. She... she's on her religion kick. All this talk of converting to Islam - has got her thinking woo-woo thoughts. - Woo-woo thoughts, Jimmy. - Woo-woo thoughts? - Woo-woo thoughts! Fantastical thoughts, indicative of a wild and impressive imagination, you know, not to mention in immense capacity for self-delusion. Oh, self-delusion. She thinks she's one of us. She is one of us. She is not. Busner found her at a... ...cant in a in Geneva. She was serving chips. He saw something in her. Some... some sort of spark. A spark? What does that mean? You never wondered why we all seem - to be in love with her. - She's cool. She's got the spark. The spark. Not... Yes. The prophecy is true. She's the chosen one? Yes. Then that means... I... it means we better be nice to her. Dear Lord. Yes. I hope I'm not interrupting anything important. It's just we're all waiting for you. Inside. Rock and roll her for me all night, will you, buddy? I'll be watching. Look at these faces full of hope. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. You may already be aware... ...God is dead. Shit! But... that does not mean... ...that we can't remain faithful. The French are coming. Kings and queens and mythic folk all in their new caliphate. There's gonna be people who resist. There's gonna be a lot of people who resist. - Oh, yeah. - But I don't think it should be us. So, we've got to have a certain vision. Tell them, honey. That's all that's required. And let me tell you something, folks. I am not worried - in the least. - No, siree Bob. No. - Myra, my dear. - Mm? Would you let our loved ones know - where you've been all their lives. - I would love to. I have been training. Training where? Where? Oh! Uh, China, Japan, Vietnam, Mexico, Argentina, Canada. - Argentina? - Uh, New Hampshire and now Paris. - Paris, France! Yeah. - Wow! And I say it's, uh, safe to assume that, uh, you're, uh, your training is all done, isn't it? - It would seem likely, honey. - Mm-hmm. That would be very probable. So I think we enlighten these people what you've been training for. Well, folks, I've been training to be... ...God. Almighty God! - I've been tapped on the shoulder... - Whoo! ...and I've been made aware that I am to assume the role when God retires. Amen! - Amen. - Yes! And God happens to be retiring this week. That would be very likely since my training is complete. So, ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, your new God, Myra from Geneva. Whoo! Look at that! Now, I know this is a lot to handle for some of you. Now, let me be clear. It was a lot for me to handle at first. - Yeah, sure. - But, after a very, a very intense training all over the world, I've learned why I... ...have been tapped to be the new God. - You ha... t... tell them why. - Ooh, I'll tell them why. - God was always meant to be a woman! - -Amen. - Yes! - There are many other women. - She's been tapped. - Oh! - I've been tapped. - I see. Now you all have a guaranteed place in the heavens above, in my home. Her heavenly castle. - Mm-hmm. - Fuck, yeah! - Yes! - Larry. All right, to celebrate, I'd like to sing you a little ditty I met from a Lebanese babe when I was vacationing in Canada. - Myra, take it away. - Oh, yeah.

Let me know if you got any plans to head out to the desert again tonight. I'll do that, Shiela. Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Shiela. - Where've you been? - Geneva. It's just the boys now, Jimmy? Los Angeles. Nighttime. We got a crime to solve and criminals to catch. I mean, what more you need? How long have you been seeing Shiela? Oh, Jimmy, I belong to the city, man. I mean, Shiela? I mean, she's just a radio operator. You know, don't get me wrong. And she has some great qualities, but ultimately, she's just a dime store bitch. I mean, at the end of the day, you know what you do? Take your dime, go to the nearest convenience store, then you find yourself another Shiela at your convenience. Maybe you just accept Alaska. But you know how that goes. Yeah, Larry won't be too happy. Oh, Larry can go fuck himself. Have you read my first chapter? Yeah. Did you like it? Yes. You notice how I made Adam a woman? Yes. It makes you wonder. Yes. Well, more for me. Why did Jimmy and Jerry get all the leads? - Our time will come. - No, man. We should probably see if Myra can do us a favor. She is quite powerful, she might be able to. Yeah, but she ain't just yet. And remember, the boss is still the boss, Ray. And between me and you, the boss is always gonna be the boss. You sound like some coop material to me. - I'm just saying. - Back burner, Ray. Back burner. Yeah. It's nighttime in Paris. Why can't you see that it's nighttime here, too? I can see that it's nighttime. It's morning in Paris. You know what I mean. Sometimes I think that I married a real asshole, you know that. But sometimes ain't all the time, honey. Mm. True. And it's the moments in between that you stick around for, don't you know? Sometimes I think that your crowning achievement is getting us to believe all this nonsense that you spew out. There's nowhere else to go. It's nighttime in Paris. Cities of the future. I need this. Perhaps. I'm not holding you back, you gotta do what you gotta do. Think I have any trouble wringing myself free from your grasp? Oh! - Hold me down. - Oh, my God. - Myra, pin me down. - You're such a douche. Make me stay. Baby, I don't even know what this is anymore. But, honey, could you clear up one thing for me? What's that, darling? Are you a real doctor? Is there a God in the heavens? I see. Are you ready? Two more minutes, please. Larry. Larry. Officers. Ray. The French are coming. The French are coming. Finally! And the night is still young. Yeah! Yes. Yes. It's really heating. The dude thinks I'm Italian. Oh! Well, you know, when we get back, you have to give it to me. I want to tell you something about money. Money is like a bird woman. You cannot keep it on the ground longer than two minutes before... ...before it flies away. You could have been a poet. I couldn't help myself. She was just... ...there. And Satie playing on the piano. And the rain... She was in a black dress. Lots of Proust at home by the fire. Words that... ...envelop you. Look in the books. Tell you it'll all be okay. I drew closer. Closer. I nailed her. I nailed so hard until I could no longer take it. And her arm goes here. Under there. She smiled. That dimple smile. I smiled. We were the new explorers, settlers in a New World. Like in the old stories. They're not love. Let it just be this. Nothing more, nothing less. No plans, no... no back story, worrying about my book. Let's be here. Right here, right now, together. Forever. So... So many words, man. You might take it in yourself a little. Well... ...in my recess, I've been touched. Larry, you can't just write anything you want. Your words have consequences. Shame on you for them barricades and shame on you for putting Jerry and Jimmy in harm's way. I've got to do what I've got to do, baby. It's a feeling. God damn Canadians. Sex and sati. There's your next novel. Hmm. Coming of age story, perhaps. About a boy who... ...becomes a man and whose fatal flaw is that he cannot achieve orgasm without the sounds of sati accompanying his mighty thrusts.

That was a very cheesy thing to say, and I feel quite offended right now. Damn! My son, you're better than this. Join us, my son. You're ready. Bring the book. I'm finished. It's time. Now. Coming. Going somewhere? I have to go now, Shiela. What we had together... ...it wasn't meant to last. Goodbye, baby. You guys aren't really detectives, are you? Jerry, want to answer that? We don't have to answer horseshit. Girls, where's the liqs here? Can kind of order. On the New Zealand z? Sure. - Triple good. - Mm. What are you doing here? We're not safe. We should take them to the house. We don't have a car anymore. We do. Come on. Jimmy, Jerry, New Zealand is not the answer. Did you just... - New Zealand is great for a vacation... - Yeah. ...for a couple of weeks, but for those in power, to those people who matter, New Zealand is nothing more than a smudge in the ocean. - It's nothing, and it's irrelevant. - Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - This bitch is badmouthing New Zealand. - I want to meet in Switzerland. To Paris to Rome, we will rule with an iron fist. - You don't know anything about New Zealand. - Oh, shut it, Jerry. You've never even been to New Zealand. - You know nothing about the Kiwi people. - Oh, I... - And you do? - I know I want nothing to do with them. Something happened between you and the New Zealand people, Myra? Let's just say if push ever comes to shove, I won't think twice about sending the little Kiwis a fist from the sky. An asteroid? Like the dinosaurs. Myra, my partner and I would like to continue this conversation in private, if you don't mind. Sorry about that, girls. Do your thing. I wanted to meet young girls. I don't know where you got the idea that we were taking you to New Zealand. Excuse me? Yeah, excuse me. No. Just trust us. Come with me. We have work to do. I've definitely been here before. Where've you been, Larry? Thought you died, Larry. My soul belongs to her now. Myra from Geneva. The one true God amongst us, our savior. And my one true love. Come now. We must tread quiet and careful for the great one can read our thoughts and hear our whispers. There is nowhere that she is not. Where are you taking us, Larry? Where I should've taken you a long time ago. Dance now! Dance to the rhythm, you fools. She's watching. She's judging us. Dance or die. Thanks, baby. Back in five. So you see, gentlemen, that is why New Zealand is the new Rome, why I've declared the new world, a world for the Kiwis. By the Kiwis. We thought lowly of you, Larry. Yeah, Larry, we had no idea your knowledge ran so deep. We thought you were just weird. Yes, well, I'm all these things. Which language is this, Larry? That's a language beyond language, Jimmy. What good is communication if it falls upon a deaf ear? I've written a tome, an eternal tome, with guiding light, sacred principles split to the infinite, legible, comprehensible not to the blind or to the deaf, but to those precious woke few whose eyes are to the sky and whose ears are clear like... ...very clear. - This is Arabic, Larry. - Yes, it is Arabic. I love this town. I used to be so ashamed. So, so, so ashamed. My sex drive turned on when I turned five, and the highway's laid itself out to me, a perpetual summer, an eternal night, warm, giving, oh, so giving. I tried at times, I have, to put on the brakes, acquiesce and be polite to those who say, "I ought a what I gotta." But there were no dice on those rolls, and the wheels, they kept on rolling. Rolling, rolling from city to city, country to country, I spread my seed, a conqueror, a player, a guilt-ridden man, so ashamed. Bidding my wick, a cessation, a stop, a slowdown. "I have things to do," I said, "things to do, like, find a job, find a friend, find a life." But that was not my destiny. My destiny was to spread myself, faults and all far and wide. And so I continued under cover of darkness to do my deeds. Conscious, hopeful even of a better tomorrow. A tomorrow beyond all that giving, beyond all that coupling, a tomorrow where I might be content to be myself by myself. A tomorrow where I'd never again have to worry about my Eve. - So you like men as well, Larry? - It's 50-50, Jerry. My point is the new Earth won't be just beyond language, it will be beyond sex. And our lives, our lives will be eternal. No longer should we grow so wise, no longer should we die so rich. We shall keep our riches and build, and we should keep our wisdom and continue to live. And we may grow more wise, make something of ourselves finally. Finally free of a deadline. God damn, that sounds good, Larry. That's some pretty good work there, Larry. Mm. It's from Marbella. - Marbella. Who the hell is Marbella, Myra? - Marbella! I think it's where I'll go to base myself out of. I'll rule with an iron fist and a sandy foot. So this is evolution. You'll choose your favorites and then you'll let me know. What is that in there? Do you remember what you learned in training? One step forward. What the hell is going on here? Takes me back to 10,000 BC Babylon. The Tower of Babylon was near completion. The tower was one, but the moves were many. No one's ever known how to dance until now. We must contribute our most here, Jimmy. Let's dance. Now... our work is done. That's funny. - She's just locked the door. - Indeed it is, Jimmy. Funny day. She locked the door. It's a nice night, though. Really is. Hey, you smell that? Sounds like some sort of poisoning. I can't breathe, Jimmy. Jerry! I think it's happening. Larry's making moves. You don't worry about it, baby. It's all part of the plan. Myra... is gonna buy us houses in the south region of France. - Marbella? - I can't. Oh! - Myra! - Oh, Myra. - Jerry. - Jimmy. I think this is it. I think we're at death's door. Yes. Myra bought it, Jimmy. Mama. Jimmy... It's been a pleasure to serve alongside... ...such an esteemed partner such as yourself, Jerry. The pleasure was all mine, Jimmy. I'm gonna cherish these moments for the rest of my life. It is time for us all to move as one. Let's go. Let's dance.
