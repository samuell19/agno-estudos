Do you ever look down at me from the sky? I look up at you. I imagine you through the clouds. I imagine you have wings, and instead of falling that day, you flew away, somewhere beautiful. Somewhere far away from here. I hope you're peering through the clouds right now, watching. Can you hear me? This is for you. Ah, fuck. Darby fire crews have been tackling a blaze which erupted at a local pub just before dawn this morning. Police are looking for a man who was seen fleeing the area shortly after the blaze broke out... ...at this time it's believed that no one was in the building. However, the cause of the fire is being treated as suspicious. It's been said that the fire started in the back room... Hi, Victor, this is Susan from the agency. Traffic's a nightmare but we will be there shortly. I stopped by last night but you were sleeping so I put some fresh milk in the fridge for you. Anyway, I just wanted to give you an update. Cheers, now. Fuck, fuck! Jesus Christ! Is this your house? Hm? You called the police? You got someone else living here, hm? Hiding from me too? Do you? Lurking around? Do you? Answer me! I thought this place was seized. Shit! Fuck, fuck. You're going to act like you ain't seen me. Where can I hide? Answer me! Speak! Fuck it, you're coming with me. Don't move. Oh, God, it's like a dungeon in here. Can you smell a cigarette? Well, I can smell something odd. I didn't know he smoked. Well, he's got to do something, ain't he? Anything to pass the time. Ah, or kill himself. My Marvin's on a pack a day almost, I keep telling him, "You live like that, there won't be much living at all." Where is he, anyway? Aw, look, here he is. Oh, he's out like a light, isn't he? He hasn't moved since last night. He's breathing, right? Yeah, he's breathing heavily like a little old bloke. As long as we don't have to repeat of that Andrew situation. I can't believe he were dead all that time. We should have realized when he didn't wake up and make remarks about our tits. Oh, what a dirty bugger he were. He left a right old inheritance, though. We should have let him touch our tits, we might've got a bit out of it. But let's make this quick, shall we? I'll make the beds, you do the dishes and we'll be out before he wakes up. Oh, we should just change his clothes quickly though, - shouldn't we? - Well, we changed them yesterday, didn't we? Oh, I don't know. No, it was the other day I think. No, he'll be all right until tomorrow. We'll be finished here quickly, won't we? We'll be back in a jiffy. All right. Hello? Hello. No, I'm just cleaning that house I was telling you about. Uh-huh. Yeah, so am I seeing you tonight then? I bet you would. So, same hotel, yeah? Well, I don't think she'll get suspicious if you're half an hour late, Tony. Well, I don't know, say the traffic's bad. Well, say the roads are blocked, I don't know, use your imagination, I'm getting a little tired of this, you know that I've got needs as well... - So the window's broken in there. - What? - Where? - In the kitchen. I'm going to have to call you back. I felt cold air coming in and lifted up the blinds and the window were broken. What, the whole window? No, just a hole, I mean a medium sized hole. You know, it was probably the wind from last night, wasn't it? I don't think it were that strong, do you? Well, there were branches all up my road this morning. I've just covered it over with a bit of sellotape. That'll do the trick. You don't suspect there's been a break in, do you? I don't think anyone would want to break in here. Right, should we call to get it fixed, then? Well, it's going to cost about 200 quid to get that repaired probably. Blimey, he doesn't have money like that. No, the council won't pay for it either. No, best thing to do is board it up and then I'll bring something more sturdy tomorrow. All right then. He's fine though, right, yeah? He hasn't moved a muscle. Right, well, dishes are done. That's it, then. Do you know what? I could use a stiff drink. Why, what's happened? Well, Tony's put me in a right old bad mood. He keeps talking about his wife. Oh, maybe he's finally feeling guilty. Well, he should have thought about that a couple of months ago, shouldn't he? Yeah. So, where are you meeting him? I don't know. I thought the hotel but he's not interested. I don't know. He's worried, worried. What about? So, what were you planning to do with this, hm? What, are you going to open me up like a letter? So, who else comes here then, hm? No, no, no, no, you ain't leaving my sight. Fucking hell, go on then. And then there were Darby and now there's here. Shit, bro, you've been to nearly as many homes as me. So, why don't no one like you? Maybe I don't like them. Yeah, I get that. What's your name? Jack. Mine's Mackie, Mack for short. You don't snore, do you? Like an old man, mate. Well, that crazy woman downstairs, she says this room will be mine soon anyways because you're going to juvie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, she hopes. One more of this and then I'm going. But that ain't happened yet. Well, she said to be careful with my stuff because you've got sticky fingers. Only when I have fried chicken, bro. You're in the bottom of my bunk. All right, fucking hell. Hi, it's me. You know, they saw something on C.C.T.V. No, there weren't no C.C.T.V, I made sure of it. Where are you right now, anyway? Somewhere they ain't going to find me, okay? Don't need to worry about that. So it worked out all right, then? Yeah, yeah, no it was good. I owe you one. I weren't sure that it would work out like that to be honest. Well, it did and I... ...I, I tell you what, it was a fucking hefty explosion at that. I'm going to stay here for a couple of days, wait it out. When everything's died down you come and get me and take me to London. All right, I got to go. What are you looking at, out there? Hm? There ain't nothing out there. You keep to yourself, keep quiet, and I won't bother you. You got that? Have you got that? You ain't seen nothing, you don't know nothing. Fucking hell. What the fuck is this? In other news, a hunt is underway for a man who was last seen fleeing Fox and Hounds Pub shortly after it fell victim to arson. The pub which is located at the south end of Darby was destroyed after a fire broke out just before dawn. A Caucasian male of medium build was seen loitering in the woods close by to... No, I almost had him in a headlock, though. Yeah? I'm not saying you didn't but, you're puny. You don't want to be fucking with blokes bigger. - I ain't puny. - Especially not the first week of school, all right? You are fucking puny. Look at the state of your arm. What they feed you in Darby? Right on a pub, bangers every night. Yeah? Why'd you leave then? Yeah, worst place in the world. Why is that? I don't know. Well, you know what they say. Sometimes out of the bad comes the good. Some fucking liar made that up. Hm, can I have one? How old are you? What's it fucking matter to you? You've got a big mouth for a little fellow, haven't you? That's what my real dad used to say. - Yeah? - Yeah. Where's he now? Jail. Yeah, mine too. What's yours in there for? - Murder. - Fucking hell. I ain't getting on the wrong side of you. Nah, I ain't nothing like him. He's got enemies everywhere that man... no sense. In and out of prison. If I went to prison, I'd just be bait. Hm. Can you light it for me? What are you a fucking puss? Shut up. - Turn it around. - Oh. There you go. Put that one in that way. - Ready? - Ready. Steady. Where'd you get them trainers from? I nicked them. I thought you said you weren't going to jail? Oh, I ain't going, you know, I'm 17, so I still got another year at the books, really. Oh. Nick me some too, then. Why would I do that? Because I'm your little brother now, ain't it? Yeah, maybe, but... maybe. What you staring at? Hold still. Still. You're a sneaky little fucker, aren't you? Hm? I don't trust old men like you. I don't trust no one. What's this then, hm? Speech impaired, autistic, asthmatic, prone to seizures. I knew there was something off with you. Better keep your wits about you then. That's right. Better behave now. You're nothing more than a puppet on a string. He's been ever so quiet lately. As opposed to what? The lengthy chats we normally have with him? Oh, you know what I mean. He's been sleeping a lot. He seems slightly down. Do you think he's depressed? No, I don't think he thinks like that. Look, I've seen his chart. He's got the brain of a child. It's hard to believe though, isn't it? I mean, look at him. He seems so much more complex. Well, he's old, isn't he? I mean, age makes you look wise. There are things I find around the house, though. You know, books with little notes in them and, and then there was a crossword done in the paper the other day. Well, maybe he had a visitor. The guy's got no family, though. You know, no emergency contacts. Well, I don't know, maybe he had a neighbor around. Oh, God knows. - Do you fancy a cuppa? - Yes, I'd love one. Would you like a cup of tea, Victor? Come on, give me a nod or a shake of the head. Come on, you can be more responsive than that. Don't bother with him, Susan, seriously. You got more chance of seeing pigs fly, mate. Oh, he must be hungry. Yeah, he hardly touched that soup I left him earlier. They're stopping the cars in Oxley, still? - Yeah, I think so. - Hm. They still haven't found that mother and daughter. - Oh, awful, that. - Yeah. - But two days missing you expect the worst, don't you? - Hm. They should check the husband, - it's always the husband. - Hm. Did you hear about that pub that exploded - a few towns over? - Oh, I know. He worked on the church on a Sunday, the owner. He was a good man. - Yeah, I know. - Good as gold. Who the hell blows up a bloody pub though, eh? I mean there could be people in it for Christ's sake. I think that was probably the point, love. Oh, now come on, Victor, - What'd you do that for, eh? - Come on now, I haven't finished my tea. Oh God, he always does it, doesn't he? Always. Come on then, let's get this shirt off. Right, come on, up you get. There you go, love. There you go. Looks like somebody forgot where his mouth was, eh? You got to wonder who all these people are, haven't you? For a lonely old man he's got an awful lot of photos, hasn't he? Aw, they've probably all passed though, haven't they? Oh, it's sad that, looking at all their faces, the old memories. Poor love. See, I think the council should move him into a home. There's people like my sister who'd love a house like this: Bit of garden, space for the kiddies. - It's wasted on him. - Hm. Oh, here Victor, look, you dropped this, mate. Ooh.. Hey, Susan, "He's here." Who is here? Will you look at that? Writing on the Queen's bloody head. Shame on him. Yeah, well, shame on this generation. - Is he done yet? - Yeah, he should be. Cheerio, Victor. Get off me. "He's here." Did you write that about me, hey? You're dumb, ain't you? You are, aren't you? You're thick. Fucking retard. You do that again, I'll fucking smother you with a fucking pillow! Fucking hell, I'll fucking stick him with his... ...reported smelling fumes and saw smoke coming from the first floor. It's been said that the fire star... Don't fucking cross me! Look at you now. Look at you now. You do that again... Fuck! Fuck. Don't make me do that again. In other news a five-year-old girl and her mother have been reported missing. They were last seen by a neighbor leaving their home a little before eight a.m. this morning... There's been fires up and down my street all day, too. First they thought it might've been a terrorist attack or something like that. Yeah, but it weren't that! Nah, and they figured that much out. But the problem now is that little girl and her mum disappeared on the same day as the pub explosion. So? Well... they reckon you're connected, that that ain't just a coincidence. It is a fucking coincidence, I've never met them in my life. Believe me all right, I'm not that kind of guy! What was that? Oh, fucking hell. Here, let me help you. Oi, where you going? All right, don't tell no one about this place. It's my little spot. It's where I come, - yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Come. Kings of the city up here. Whoa. Hey. 999 if you see anyone suspicious and police have urged not to approach him as he may be armed and dangerous. Officers are searching Darby and the surrounding areas tonight, including a male suspect who was last seen loitering outside the Fox and Hounds Pub shortly after it fell victim to arson. The suspect is said to be in his late teens, medium build and has a tattoo on the outside of his neck. It's been confirmed that the pub landlord died in hospital earlier today from injuries sustained in the blast. The husband and father of two... ...morning locals today, and questions are circulating on why his pub was a target. What the fuck are you doing? Mm? Are you trying to push me? What's this? What the fuck have you got in here, eh? What are you fucking hiding? Fuck! Don't make me do it, don't fucking make me do it! Do you want me to hurt you? Is that it? Do you? You're fucking mad. Fucking mad. Where do I know you from? What? Where do I know you from? I don't know, I've never seen you before in my life. That's funny, because I could have sworn you were staring at me like you thought you knew me. Staring? I ain't staring at no one, you were staring at me. What are you listening to? Drum and bass? - Can I hear it? - Maybe. Let's have a listen. - You like this crap? - All right, done then. What's your tattoo say? "Lost boy." "Lost boy," why, are you lost? Ain't we all? I ain't. Oh, you got it all figured out, do you? Well, how about you give me your number then? Maybe I've got a boyfriend. Ever think about that? Yeah, I did think about that and I thought I was probably better looking and more charming. All right, fine. Here, charm me then, go on, put your number in. Calm down. The next station is Stafford Road. Mind the gap between the train and the platform. Save you in there as "Lost Boy," yeah? Yeah, you do that. Don't forget to call me, yeah? All right, all right. Calm down. Here we go then. Where is he? - Oh, he's in here. - Oh. Morning, Victor. - How are you? - Oh, it stinks in here. He hasn't pissed himself again, has he? Oh, we'll have a look. -All right. No, no, he's fine. I'll just put the kettle on. You're fine, aren't you? Now, that's all done there. - So, I'll put it there. - All right. Go into the other room. See if there's any cups in there still. Should we put him to bed? Oh, no, let's just leave him in the chair. I put my back out last night. - Did you? How'd you manage that? - It was Tony. Yeah, his wife stopped having sex with him a couple of months ago so he's taking all his sexual aggression out on me. Oh, good grief. Best sex I've ever had, though. Don't you find it stressful? You know, all this sneaking around behind your partners back? Well, it's really expensive, what with all the hotels and everything. We did it in the car last night. That's why I'm walking like a cripple today. That's nice, that bracelet, is it new? Oh, no, it's a family heirloom actually, it's an antique. - Is it? - I got it appraised the other day. It's worth more than I thought it was. Oh. Hey, spitting now? Cheeky. Oh, he's slowly disintegrating, isn't he? Poor thing. What was that? Did you hear a noise coming from the wardrobe? Yeah. Maybe it's that mouse that's back. - Oh. - I'll get it out with this. - Look, here, look. - Oh, no, don't, don't. Don't open it, it might run out. Oh, God, Victor! What are you doing? - Just get him up. - Jesus, oh. Well, at least he's breathing. He's fine now, fuck me, my back. - Jesus. - Come on, let's just go. All right, I've had enough anyway. See you tomorrow, Victor. Fucking twat. Why didn't you grouse on me? Hm? That's not loaded. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right. For Christ sake... So where'd you get it, then? Hm? There ain't nothing more powerful than holding a gun, is there? Make you feel like a king, does it? Hey? I told you not to leave my sight. In other news, a search is still underway for a missing mother and daughter who were last seen four days ago in the town of Darby. Locals met at the church yesterday to organize search parties. Locals have been asked to stay out of the woods... Officers are searching Darby and surrounding areas tonight. The hunt for a male suspect who was last seen loitering outside the Fox and Hound Pub... What the fuck? You've got everyone fooled, don't you? The poor old man. The poor pathetic old man. But you, you ain't what you claim. Are you? In no way, are you? So what is it, hm? So what is it you're looking for when you look out that window? Hm? What you hiding from? Oh, fucking hell. What's this for? Oh, would you look at that. Go on, then. Stop it. Oh, fucking hell, there's another one. You're a sneaky old man, aren't you? You got all these little cubbies, little secrets. So, go on. What is it? What are you hiding? Come on. I ain't going to grouse on you. I might even be able to help you. Might be able to help each other. Maybe we ain't that different. Why you scream in your sleep? Are you scared of something? So, what is it? What are you... Fucking hell! Fucking rodent prick. Oh, that's funny is it? Yeah, yeah, that's funny. Fucking hell. Fucking hell. How do you live like this? This is bullshit. I took four trains to get here today. It took me three hours. Oh, as you should to see your mother. Three hours? Where they got you living these days? - London. - London? Hm. Excuse me. Look at you with the golden ticket. Well, I'm sure you're living in better quarters than this. Right shit hole this is. This is good for you. Oh, yeah... ...treating me like a second class citizen, they are. The new room's all right. Got a foster brother there, too. Well, family ain't family unless it's blood. Don't you go forgetting that now. I can see a change in you. Who's the bird? There is someone. Maybe. What's her name? It's Lucy. Lucy. Is Lucy a good girl? Yeah. Yeah? What you going to do with that then, eh? A good girl? I mean, I were a good girl once... and look at me now, huh? This is your father's doing, this is. You don't want to end up like your father, mate. He and I ain't nothing alike. Scars all down my back there's been. Scars on my heart, too. I can't see you acting any different. I'm telling you. You best let her go now. You start acting crazy like he were. Yeah. You take any advice from your mother, you take that. Or in ten years time you'll be coming to visit her in here too. Especially by midnight, yeah? Hello? Hello? Jack... is that you? Jack? Are you not going to say anything? Fuck. Got it all wrapped up then. Here he is. Good morning, Victor. He's got the brain of a five-year-old so don't expect him to understand anything. Fair enough. So, Victor, I'm David Barrow. I run the elderly home at Kenley. Yeah, we're going to move you into a home, Victor. It's for the best. So, I would suggest anything important, memories, et cetera, you put them aside and we'll make sure they're all packed up for you, all right? Are you sure he can't talk? I told you he can't, he's a mute. What's happening to all the rest of this stuff? It will get donated, sold on. Council usually sort all that out. Where's his family? No one really knows. No family at all? One of us tried to trace them. The house is under a Rita Brenner, she says he's an old friend of her deceased mother but that's all the information we've got. - Dreadful. - Mm-hm. But we'll take good care of you, Victor, all right? Well, I think that's about it, isn't it? I think you've covered it, David. Let's get you back up there shall we, Victor? Come on. So, Victor... remember to put out all your belongings like David mentioned, yeah? Hey? Oh, you want that? Oh. Wait a minute. Let go of my arm. Let go. Just stop it! Everything all right in there? Yeah, we're fine, thanks. We'll see you tomorrow then, Victor. Goodbye then, Victor. That can't be good. Get away from me! What was that, hey? What was that? Come on, fucking spit it out. You, dirty fucker. Come on, talk, fucking talk then. You were fucking talking before, hey? See, if you were going to shoot me, you would have done it already. Do you think I'm fucking stupid? There's a fucking reason you haven't done me in yet. Hm? So, what is it? What are you hiding? Huh? What are you? A crook? Money launderer? Gangster? No. You ain't got the balls. You're a creepy little old... Shit! Fuck, fuck! Fuck. Okay, calm down. I take it back. All right? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Come on, take it. Hm? And tomorrow... you will clean my blood from off your hands. My sticky blood... from under your fingernails. For weeks... I will stain your fingernails and you will realize you are like the man who climbs to the top of the mountain and longs for the floor. You're a coward. Coward boy. So, come on. Take it. Come and shoot. If you were going to kill me, you would have done so before now. Look, you're not that far from me, just come pick me up now. Listen, I can't be involved no more. All right? It's got way bigger than what it were meant to. Now, I paid you to look out for me. And I did, you said you wanted to fuck up a pub and I helped you with that. But the deal, the deal was to drive me to London. Now, I've got no one else to call out. I ain't going to jail, bro. You've got half of Scotland Yard after you, and now, with this mother and daughter hiccup, too. Hiccup, what fucking hiccup, I got nothing to do with them! But you do. No, I don't. Yeah, you do. Check the news, bro. Walked into Darby early that morning to pick up a classmate of Rachel's. It's been thought that Rachel, who was five, needed to use the bathroom, so they entered the closed pub moments before the pub explosion. Her memorial traveled by the playground where she used to play, by the pond which she loved to feed the birds, by her elementary school... There wasn't going to be anyone there! One for you and one for me. Nicked them from the corner shop. Oh, mate, you're an idiot, there is cameras all up in the stores. Well, I ain't caught, am I? Well, I'm just saying, if you go back to juvie, I'm stuck here with that crazy bitch downstairs. Don't stress, I ain't going to juvie, mate. Mm, I'll give you my word, yeah? My word is golden. I'm a golden boy, eh? Remember that. I'll tell you what, don't laugh but, when I turn 18... ...I'm going to adopt you. We can go wherever the fuck we want, eh? Don't have to listen to that dumb bitch no more. We can just do anything. Oh, you're just pissed, mate. That's my dream, that is. How good would that be? All right, mate, take it easy. I'll ask you a question. Yeah, what? What are these, though? Are they cigarette marks? Who gave them to you? Huh? Who gave you the marks on your chest? Mackie? What? Are you looking at me? What? Are you looking at me? Looking at my chest? What are you talking about? Are you looking at me? Fuck, no. That... Don't fucking look at me! Stop it! Stop fucking staring at me you fucking perv! What is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you? I ain't perving on you, fool! Who do you think I am, eh? I'd never d... I'd never do that. I'd fucking never do that! Who do you think I am! I'm your fucking brother. I'm your brother. Fuck. What the fuck was all that about then, eh? Who perved on you? Obviously someone did. - No one. - Don't lie. I've been through some fucking shit myself, you know that! Like this? No. There was a bloke at the last home, he used to... He used to belt me until I bled and then some, and then some more, and then more. I almost died. That guy in Darby, the one that owned the pub, was it him? He perv on you? Dirty fucking cunt. We'll confront him, we'll do it together, yeah? We'll... We'll fucking, we'll... No, no, no I don't want to ever see him again. Rita speaking. I need you to do me a favor. Now what? My watch has been stolen. If they find it, if they find out where it came from, it has on the back my initials. Shit. Andrew's home. I can't help you. Don't call me back and I mean it. Wait, you can't... Bastard. Bastard! Can I ask you a question? Do you ever get this feeling inside or just... this pain? It's constant. You can't feel it but like, it's there and it just bothers you, and it's there and it doesn't go away. I've been like this forever. And it's getting to a point where I just... You're going to be fine, huh? You got to be strong. Everything is fucked up. You've got to be strong. Yeah? Look at me. You'll be okay. You'll be okay. Please, God, make it go away, make me forget. Make it disappear, please. I can't take this no more. I'm sick of it. Please... make me forget. Make it go away. I can't take it no more. Please. Make it go away. Make me forget, I can't take it no more. Please, God. Make it go away. Make me forget. Make it disappear, please. Help me, I can't take this no more. Make me forget. I'm sick of it. Please, I can't take it no more. Make me forget. Please... Jack? Miss... it's bad enough being in juvie, I don't need anger fucking management. You were warned about being sent to juvie, though. So, why did you continue stealing? Well, my little brother was... he was feeling down so I just... nicked him a pair of shoes to cheer him up. - It doesn't say here that you have a brother. - Well, I do. - What's his name? - Mackie. Look, can you tell them out there to give me my phone privileges? He ain't go no one else but me and I need to speak to him, I need to make sure he's doing all right. I'm sure he can handle a few days without you. No, you don't get it. He's in a bad place, he's been through some shit and he ain't tough like me. He's been... crying a lot, sometimes all night and I... and he says things that worry me. I just need to speak to him. Please, Miss. Hey, this is Mackie. I missed your call... Well, this is the fifth message I've sent you today, surely they let you use the phone in juvie, or are you just not answering my calls? Anyway, that crazy bitch downstairs, yeah, well she locked me in my room for 12 fucking hours. I ain't got no one to talk to either. I can't take this anymore. I can't take it anymore. Come on! Jump! Why me, huh? - Come on! - Come on! Come on! Do it! Come on! I should've been there. I should've been there! You couldn't have saved him, Jack. Fuck! I should've been there! I should've been there. He was my brother. Larry, it's me. Pick up. Don't leave me stranded here, Lar. It was an accident, I made a mistake. Please. You get me out of here, I fucking mean it. I know what you're thinking, can you trust me, right? I'll tell you this. I'll make it worth your while if you do. I'm Jack. See you later. Larry. Shh, shh, shh. Oh, it fucking stinks in here. Shh, shh. - Stop, listen. - What? - I've got... - What is it? I'm going to see if he's asleep. Stay Tony, stay there now, stay there now. Let me come. Send him my love. You want me to wait with him or not? - Easy there. - What? He's calling you a cab. So this is better than a hotel, isn't it? - Cozy. - Cheaper. Wait, wait, wait. It's the fucking jewelers again, that's the third time today. What are they bothering you for? I took that watch in. The watch you got for me? Yeah, I was going to get it polished. So? Well, they called to ask if I had any receipts for it and I said, "I don't have a receipt because it's a family watch." And they said, "We need to check the history." I said, "Well, there isn't any history - because it's my grandad's watch." - So, what was it all about? And they'll tell me when I want to get it but I couldn't go today because I got my nails done. - Oh. - It'll be fine. It's a big misunderstanding. We haven't got enough time, come on. Do a little lap dance for me. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Show me that sexy body. All right then. Take your knickers off. I'm not wearing any though, am I? Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, my God. I know. Oh, fuck! Hi, Victor, I'm really sorry. It won't happen again, I'm so sorry... Tony? Jesus Christ! Look, Victor, put that down. Go back to bed, we'll go home and it won't ever happen again, I promise. I promise it won't happen again. Me too, we didn't mean it. Honestly, Sir... Shit! Help me, fucking help me. Help me! Get up and help me, fucking help me! Come on, fucking help me! I said don't call me. You're lucky Andrew's not here. What do you want? Why is it, when I think of your mother, I hear her voice still in my head? But... with you, I have problem. I forget the tone, the pitch. I wonder what you look like when you're speaking. Do your eyes light up... when you're smiling? How do you look... when you're happy, sad, puzzled? These are things I do not know and... I've wished so much that you would knock on my door and let me see you. That will never happen. I let a man go once. Right through my fingers, he went. He climbed under the wire. I chased him, caught him. He was bleeding, trembling. And... just that day, I'd learned... that I had a little girl. She lived in England. She was three years old. And I thought, "What would she want in a father?" Power or kindness? So... I let him go. He flew away, free. The watch taken to a jewelry shop yesterday afternoon... ...It's been confirmed that a watch taken into... ...This jewelry store yesterday afternoon formerly belonged to high ranking S.S. Captain Klaus Oxman. S.S. Captain, Klaus Oxman. It's been suspected for some time that Oxman was residing in England, where he had fled after World War II.

He was known by survivors of the death camp as "The Man Behind the Desk." "The Man Behind the Desk." The devil. Authorities have been searching for Oxman... The watch had his initials on the back and was seen in many historical photographs. Don't you regret it? Hello, it's the police, anyone home? Bit of a mess around here. Hello? No one in, mate. Do you want to have a look down the back? Anybody here? Hey, this is Mackie. I missed your call, but... maybe I'll call you back, or maybe I won't. Leave a message and I'll catch you later, yeah? Bye. Bye.
