Heroes Public Safety Commission Since a few weeks, they attack different heroes Victims end up unconscious and lost their Alters. Shigaraki's group seems to be developing ... a replica of the drug to clear the Alters Do we know if they have succeeded in make their mass product? No we don't know So we have to investigate, continue with ... Could the alters have been stolen? That? Simply because the victims are heroes, their alters are things that can be used Course the suspect would someone like All For One ... with an Alter capable of flying other Alters It is not possible... Anyway, Shigaraki is of course involved I will continue the two lines of investigation Where will the charge be? The heroes haven't recovered it, have they? This is the information we have What was in the box? The doctor said we don't need to know What does it mean? We just had to deliver it and then keep silent? I'm a little curious I already told you, forget that, okay? Understood! I do not care! Tomura shigaraki You shouldn't be involved Forget that Doctor KYUSHU In ten days, youâ€™ll go home, right? Dad, good luck with the job You don't have to worry about us I will take good care of Katsuma Thank you, Mahoro, Katsuma I will bring you many gifts ... We finally found you What ... what are they doing? Do not worry. I will not kill you. But... I'll take your Alter With that we will get there As we always wanted ... We will create a new world! Nine! Why? Why? Type B is not enough Then? Since we had come so far! Damn! No, there is still a way. Dad, good luck with the job You don't have to worry about us It is true The Alters ... are inherited ... Why are you coming with me, damn Deku? What do you mean, why? If it is true that a villain ... With me, it's more than enough! Hey, where did you see this villain?

So you are with her Enough Kacchan! Let me go stupid Deku! It's just a joke! Kids today have no respect! Hold on! Hold on! Stop it! Don't give me orders! What's wrong with this Bakugo guy? And so he wants to be number 1! It is rather the number 1 of heroes who looks like a villain! But he came to save us Katsuma, Do you want to be a hero like them? Do not do that It's very dangerous Also, I know a person who is taller than these heroes Who is that ? Our father He always thinks of what which is better for us. I would like you to become someone like him. Among the victims, there are still someone who has lost their alter. But this time it was not a hero, but an ordinary citizen. Besides flying alters, it seems that they are looking for something specific. Does the suspect want us to know what kind of alters did they fly? Why do they need to hide it? Hello ! You talk at the office of Yuei's heroes. A lost travel suitcase. Understood. Let's go immediately. A traveler has lost his suitcase in the commercial area. I will go! Come on Aoyama! Yes! Another lost object! At unless they could fix it alone ... This customer had a very cute voice! I have to help whoever needs it! Shoji called for support on the beach. Then I will go. Now is the time to patrol. I'm also going to. I will help Mr. Niijima in his cultivation. See you! Katsuma? What is happening? This... Sorry about yesterday. What a good boy! You came to apologize. Don't worry, I'm not crazy Could you tell the other hero that I apologized? Of course. But what really happened to Katsuma? My sister hates heroes. He said if a villain appears ... They would be afraid and would not come to save us That's why I ... You trusted us. Then? You said we were going to save you. So you came to pick us up This badge. He's the hero Ninja, Edgeshot right? Yes. Would you also like to be a hero? My alter doesn't allow me to be a hero. Besides, my sister says it's dangerous. These heroes of the Yuei academy They are useless! I see, Not that Mahoro hates heroes ... but she worries about Katsuma. Izuku ... I can not anymore. You hurt yourself all the time ... My heart can no longer bear it ... Hey !, Katsuma. What kind of hero would you like to be? A strong hero who can face the villains. I see. I want to be a hero who can save everyone from danger. Save others? Yes You wanted to be a hero who defeats villains to save others. I want to be a hero who saves the others by defeating the villains. It's a little different, but the objective is the same. That's what it is to be a hero. So, in this case ... Let's do our best! But if possible, don't don't worry too much about your family. Yes! Katsuma really likes heroes, right? I brought you this. Thank you very much Ms. Suzumura! Be nice to him. The boyâ€™s mother died very young, His father works outside while time. He and his sister live alone Of course, the neighbors are present with them all the time. But not having your mom at his age is a very sad thing. Sister! Where were you katsuma With Deku! I went to apologize for yesterday Why? I really like dad I want to be someone tall like him But... But... What was that? Breakwaters, what about this ship? Run away ! Huh ?! What's going on ? Chimera, mom Don't let anyone bother us You will be in charge of the distraction Something special? As you wish Okay Slice ... I already know ... Of course, they are villains. Sister, we have to call the heroes But they are still students If it's Deku, he will surely come to save us! I'm done with the field work! Welcome, Midoriya Good work! What?

Yes Quick, get out of here Yes Why are you chasing these children? Back off I'm not leaving here If you interfere, I will kill you Air wall? So that's your alter! Did he shoot lightning? Looks like he has two independent Alters It's almost like ... All for one! Stop Bakugo! You fully controlled it What do we do Kirishima? I do not know Cursea! Damn it! To choose You can become my puppets ... or be defeated by your partner Shut up! Do not make me laugh! Then? Do not underestimate me Swelling of my two. He sacrificed his own weapons I still have a lot of capacity Maximum power! Pass away! You did it Bakugo! And with minimal damage to buildings Guys ! And the villain? He is slightly injured What about the locals? We evacuated them all to the west area Where are you going bakugo Take care of the rescue! I'm going to crush the remaining villains! Curses He cornered us with his power Iida, what do we do? For now, I think we keep it on the sidelines At least until we finish moving people Black ankh! Recipro Burst! They're hard to break, hero! If this continues ... Delaware Smash ... Aviation! Aerial projectiles What an interesting way to use it I have to keep attacking him if I don't want to not that he gets close to Katsuma and his sister! You can also launch gusts of wind! How many does he have in reserve? If I can't know what are your alters, then I must strike first! One for all, full hood! At 20%! His power increased With this power ...! Saint Louis... Smash! 20% was not enough! This strength ... This Alter ... Worth flying Steal it? He said he would steal it So if you have a Alter equal to All For One ... He will steal my One For All! I couldn't steal it No, it does not fit into the slot This guy... has an alter of incredible potential. I have to move Come on! Come on! It's amazing But for that, I have to delete it Did he throw me with the air wall? Deku? Deku! To run away! But...! I'm fine, run away You are... His goal Deku! Quick... Run away! No... No... No!

I'm too strong for you! Where does this come from? Move! Move! You are like a crying dog This... it's you! Damn Deku! Detroit ... Smash! What is happening? What's going on? Electricity... Now... I will not leave you... go... It's still... Is not over Deku ... Bakugo ... The heroes are really ... It hurts Why? Nine! Resist Nine The boy is ... Understood ! Stay calm. Do not worry We are on your side Here Tsuyu! Ribbit You have to reach them ... No matter how, this child ... Nine ... They can't leave this island You should now recover Already ?! For today, they will save their lives, children Is he running away ?! It is more appropriate to say that he spared us Shit. Stopped ! It can be a trap We couldn't even overcome in numerical inferiority. Trying it alone is very dangerous But... The security of populations is more important It's also our hero's job They use their Alters too much We don't know when they will attack us again If we don't do it now, there won't be ... You are already reaching the limit Here Thank you It's hot, be careful Take one per person! There is something for everyone What happened to the Villains? Do not worry ! We will take care of you and we will protect you all How full of food this island is! What happened to the villain they caught? He's locked up in the engine room But no matter how much you question, he doesn't seem to tell us anything Todoroki How are Deku and the others? They haven't regained consciousness yet Doctors give them treatment Thank you very much for your effort. Sorry With our Alters, we were barely able to close his wounds There is nothing we can do about his fractures For that you need the take to hospital I can help Katsuma? The Katsuma Alter has the power to reactivate cells We do not know if this could help heal wounds but ... But they were injured trying to save us! Therefore... We would appreciate it, kid Yes! I have to save them No... I will save you! How is he doing? He will be fine In few hours, He can get up And Mamy? Not here? Maybe the heroes ... Impossible Either way, we have to continue with what was planned, We need to We need to Why did you save me? Come with me We are going to destroy this society which call naughty people and monsters We will create a world that will only be dominated by force Are you going to join the Alliance des Vilains ?! Strictly speaking ... I will participate in an Alliance experience to increase the power of the Alters They just want to use you It's very dangerous We need more power We chose you You can't leave us I managed to adapt the factor d'Alter by All For One Fly 8 other Alters You have become able to use 9 Alters. The experience was a success We can finally realize our plan However, the side effects also got worse If I use the Alters, the cells and the tissues of my body will die It is not possible... This operation therefore made no sense! I have to steal an alter able to activate cellular tissue. And so... We can create the world we want Katsuma at least sleep No I must continue But ... I have to continue i can't give up Heroes never give up! Deku? Bakugo? I will first make a report on the current situation Electricity and communications have been destroyed We cannot ask for help Some time ago, I created a drone with a distress message We sent him to ask for help So at least it will take six hours to help will take longer I don't think the villains wait until then to act again For now our priority absolute is to protect the locals How are we going to do it? This villain managed to hurt seriously Midoriya and Bakugo The one we met was really skillful Yaomomo and Kaminari abused their Alters, so they can't fight ... And as far as we know, there are still three cowardly villains We cannot even not attack them at once, If only we could know what their purpose is ... Yes Then we could at least take action I will steal your Alter Katsum- I'm the target of these villains What did you say? He said he wanted to steal my Alter. Steal your Alter? Is it like All For One? But now we know what its purpose is If we run away with the child ... It will not be so easy They are villains If we run away with the child, they could threaten to kill people So what can we do? I will let myself be captured! Then? I'll let him steal my Alter, he said he wouldn't kill me. If it serves to save them all ... We will not do that! Deku? Midoriya! Are you fine Thanks to Katsuma Alter My Alter doesn't allow me to be a hero Cellular activation An Alter that promotes metabolism It's like it's a stimulant Thanks to this, I was able to recover quickly He's an incredible Alter, Katsuma! I thank you infinitely ! Deku ... You must not be afraid This is why we are here All we have to do is to crush those damn bad guys, right? Bakugo! Save to beat Win to save If you recognize yourself ... you'll become... surely one of the strongest heroes We will definitely protect you! And I'm going to crush these villains! We will save the islanders! I will definitely win! Bakugo, Midoriya, I'm with you Me too! I want to protect inhabitants of this island. Fight! In one way or another! I still have to fix the tractor from Matsuda I want Mrs. Sato to be able to live much happier I am also with you! Me too I am in me too Me too! And me Me too! Ribbit! Let's do it! Yes let's do it We need to! Because we are heroes! We will show you that there is no impossibility What we always say Let's go there! More Ultra! Midoriya, what is the strategy? We confirmed three villains. We will make our base in the ruins of the castle So the villains won't only one emergency exit Here we will separate them and at from there we will use the earth I will beat them We will shelter the inhabitants in the caves in these ruins We will protect Katsuma and Mahoro We will also secure your escape route How do we face someone able to use several different alters? When Kacchan and I fought him, he suddenly seemed to be suffering from something. It is likely that if he uses too much of the Alters, his body can no longer handle it. That's why he's trying to steal the Alter of Katsuma, to reactivate its cells I understand. So are we going to make him use them? We will attack it in waves to make him use his Alters To keep it from us try to steal ours ... we will attack him at distance as much as possible If we can defeat him, that's fine, but if we can't do it ... just resist up help arrived We will protect you all You are wrong We will definitely win Nine! Our goal is at the top of Mount Shiroyama Heroes too Are they locked in there? We will go directly to them A real king doesn't need tricks Here they are There is three They advance along the planned route I leave it in your hands, Yaoyorozu, Aoyama The villains are 20 meters from the point Aoyama, shoot your Navel Laser at maximum power. Charge energy 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1. I can't stop running Super Nova! MORE ... ULTRA! They separated! I'm going to use all the fat I have left This is my last attack! Where have you...? What... ? First phase ... accomplished I can not anymore We separated them successfully Good! We take them at determined points So far it's been going as planned We will certainly protect you all! Tape Shot Trident! Release! Uraraka! Sero! We make the villain ... Use your Alters! Shoot! They separated us Damn it! Damn! Closely! Ashido, leave me the rest It's my territory How arrogant Did you want to separate us? Good! It went as planned Not yet It was not cold enough Let's meet You better give up Today I will fight seriously We are not the same as before All people are protected. Let's fight it all! We will arrest you I'm going to Turbo! It will be over in 10 minutes! YES! I am superior to you! Damn, it doesn't stop a bit Release! He's approaching the trap! YES Sero! Uraraka! Mineta! Everything is ready! It's your turn, Uraraka MORE... ...ULTRA! It's your turn, Mineta! Super grape! Take this, this and that! Take this and that! This is a trap! We did it! It worked...! You're okay? You deserved it! We caught you! He escaped the trap It is 30 meters from us! Do not interfere! Aoyama, Yaomomo ... Sorry for the delay... Here we are... Do not meddle! The game is over Are you still alive ?! Stop talking and die! Bakugo is fighting with him! Midoriya! I entrust you to Katsuma and Mahoro! Deku ... Deku ... We have to stop it here! Take this! I have to protect this site! Or it wouldn't make sense to call me a hero! Saint-Louis Smash! I don't need all my strength. he it's just about him using his Alters Explode-A-Pult! They are not bad Behind us are ... It doesn't matter, I'm going to kill him! Was it not your territory? Show again! That's it? I find it hard to stop it If only for a moment ... Pathetic! Black Ankh Sabbath! Now! Acid kick! Ashido! It's already decided! Not yet! Ashido! Damn! What is that? They will not interfere, Nine! Tokoyami, Dark Shadow ... Do not bother me! I do not do it! It was useless ... Didn't I tell you it was useless? My body... Our attack pattern was part of the plan My legs and hands of Kirishima were covered with ... a toxin made by Asui Call me Tsuyu It was our idea Ingenious! But i will show you The reason they call me a monster! He got bigger! This form ... is like Amajiki! Asui! Kero! There is Iida and the others! They fight? We have to help them. We can't, we have to protect Katsuma and Mahoro Deku ... Bakugo ... We have you now! Sero! Just a little bit! Uraraka! Forgive me ... Deku Damned! You will pay for it! We have to roll it back He gets too close to children ... Curses ... This is... It is done! It has reached its limit But what power! We will not be able to approach Recipro reaches the limit Create an opening I'll take care of him What will you do? I have an idea Okay It will be the last attack! Iida, grab your attention with Recipro Turbo It reminds me of Kamino. And it's! Whatever happens, I'll go there resist, be sure to defeat him! Unbreakable! Kirishima! Go... Increase the temperature of your body to the limit! If it can be done with fire, also with ice! Todoroki! Exceed the limit! Ribbit! Freeze! It's time to hibernate We have done our part Midoriya ... Bakugo ... It's time to counter Kacchan! Don't give me orders! If I had the power to activate my cells This is our opportunity! I don't need to contain myself! Deku ... Bakugo ... Deku ...! Bakugo ...! Cellular activation? Yes However, my Alter will only work with type A blood cells. It is a very useful Alter to help people Mr. Shimano, do you have a family? I have a daughter and a son on Nabu Island Nabu is far away, but within reach of criminals Excuse me a moment What is there? A fishing boat in Kyushu received a distress message Villains have appeared on the island of Nabu, we must act! They are the suspects of the loss of Alters! What are you saying ? Send a rescue team immediately! And inform Yuei! Why Yuei? For a government project, they are in charge of the island of Nabu ... Students in class 1-A!
