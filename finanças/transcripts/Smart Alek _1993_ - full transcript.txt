(birds chirping) - [Son] Fucking, wanking, tossers. (dog barking) - [Dad] Well if that boy would tidy up his room, he'd be able to find some- - [Mum] Oh, leave him alone. You never leave him alone. Just let his- - [Dad] He's big enough and old enough to look after himself. - [Mum] He's got what he's taking, - [Dad] I told him. - [Mum] anything that he hasn't got, stays behind. I told him anything he hasn't got, he doesn't have it, that's it. - [Dad] All right then. If he's not out on the landing in ten minutes time, it's not going. - [Mum] Well that's all right, he understands it. He understands it. He's got the message. What do you think it's like for me? It's not a holiday for me. - [Dad] Do you know how much this cost me? Do you know how much, every year, this costs me? - [Mum] Every year? Yes, well I would rather, I would rather not go on holiday every year. I'd rather go on holiday every other year and have something decent! - [Dad] That's just like you, isn't it? Now spoil it for everybody. - [Mum] It's not spoiling anything - [Dad] The kids, my mother, me? I work hard-- - [Mum] Well, what about me? - [Dad] and this is our holiday! - [Mum] What about me? - [Dad] And you don't want to go. - [Mum] Don't you even care about me, you never think about what my-- I work the whole year through and my holiday-- my holiday isn't just the same as being at home, but more so 'cause I've got your mother with me all the time. Day in, day out, 24 hours a day with her in hair rollers, and her bloody dog yapping around my heels. - [Dad] I just think-- - [Mum] I'll never do anything else. You're always losing your temper! No wonder your blood pressure's always up! Look at you, you're going red now, look at you! It's going, it's going, it's going. Yes, I told you, it's going! - [Dad] All right then, I'll take it downstairs, I'll put it with the rest of-- - [Mum] There's another suitcase as well. - [Dad] Where's the suitcase? - [Mum] And there's the buckets and spades. - [Dad] You put that suitcase down on the landing? - [Mum] No, the suitcase-- I brought it down from the landing, an hour ago. (indistinct arguing) - [Grandmother] Taurus... "A female friend or relative could make "upsetting remarks towards you this week." (arguing continues) "Shops at centre of residents' anger." Jumble sale. Saturday, Poverest Primary School. - [Dad] I'll take it down! I'll put it with the rest-- - [Mum] Good, good! And make sure that goes in before the hair dryer. And the toilet rolls, and-- - [Dad] We're going to Jaywick, not the bloody North Pole. (seagulls crying) (carnival music) (seagulls crying) (ominous music) - [Grandmother] Oh My Giddy Aunt! Mrs. Dixon's been shot at, with a gun! I can't believe it! She used to come round and borrow our washing machine. "The murderous gang panicked and ran leaving the 67-year-old widow..." She told me she was 62. "Leaving her lying in a pool of blood." Rotten devils! "The three raiders escaped empty handed. "One of the evil trio is known to have a spider tattooed on his neck." (jovial music) (man roaring) - [Dad] I know you, I know you! I married you! - [Mum] Oh, you don't know me! You think you know me, but you-- - [Dad] I know you. - [Mum] No, you don't. (indistinct arguing) - [Dad] --and then you have two children and you turn them against my mother! (arguing indistinctly) (dog panting) - [Mum] She turned them against herself! - [Dad] (arguing indistinctly) - [Mum] Jesus Christ! Shut your bloody mouth! Shut up! (Dad roaring in frustration) - [Mum] Just shut up! (jovial music continues) - [Grandmother] Come on children. We're off to Jaywick Sands. Say bye-bye. Come on now, say bye-bye. Bye-bye! Bye-bye! (carnival music) (ominous carnival music) (dog panting, whining) - [Daughter] Mummy! - [Son] Mum, can you tell her to just shut up? (indistinct arguing) (recording playing) (family singing) - [Dad] I know how to drive. (family singing) (recording playing) - [Dad] Will you stop kicking my chair? Just put your feet back! - [Son] Why are we going to Jaywick? - [Grandmother] We always go to Jaywick, you know that. - [Son] Exactly, well can't we go somewhere different? - [Mum] No. - [Son] Dad, can't we go abroad? - [Dad] Oh, yes, we've all got the money to go abroad, yes. - [Mum] Yeah. - [Dad] Seems to be the new fad. Well, what's wrong with going somewhere nice in England? - [Son] Yeah, all my friends go abroad. - [Dad] All your friends? You haven't got any friends. (indistinct chatter) - [Daughter] No, Mummy, he's got his knife! Mummy-- - [Son] I'm not gonna hurt you! - [Grandmother] Oh look. Those cows look just like-- (cows mooing) - [Mum] What's that smell? Is that you? - [Daughter] I think it's the fumes. It's Farmer Charles's field. It's what they call-- Mummy. Mummy! She's gonna get us a Knickerbocker glory when we get there. - [Mum] Won't that be nice? - [Daughter] Yeah! - [Grandmother] You won't forget to stop, son, when I need to go, will you? - [Dad] Yes-- yes-- - [Daughter] Daddy, Granny needs to go! - [Grandmother] No, not right now. - [Daughter] (singing) Granny needs to wee wee, Granny needs to wee wee! - [Server] So, you know, what do you want? If you wish I could do the whole lot for you. But, have a look at the prices, see what you're ordering, okay? If you want the whole of the lot, you want the whole lot, I'll do the whole lot. On French Bread, look. Like that. We've got a menu down there. - [Dad] Here. - Yes, I've on the board, right? On the board, we've got one menu there. There's sausage sandwich, egg sandwich. All right? Burger sandwich, burger and cheese, egg and bacon sandwich. So, you know, what do you want? If you wish, I can do the whole lot for you. All right? Burger sandwich, burger and cheese, egg and bacon sandwich. So you know, what do you want? If you wish I could do the whole lot for you, but have a look at the prices, see what you're ordering. - [Grandmother] Look at that! - Move up. - I'm not moving up! (Grandmother singing) - [Daughter] Mummy, he bumped me-- Mum! (Grandmother singing) (indistinct arguing) - Can you shut up? [Son] Mum, can you tell her to get back? Mum, can you tell her to get back, I can't see. - [Dad] Can't you behave yourselves for five minutes? - [Son, whispering] Tosser. - [Dad] Can you keep an eye on them, Mum? - [Grandmother] Don't swear. - [Daughter] Daddy. Daddy, he swore, he swore. - [Son] Fucking, wanking, tossers. He swore Daddy. - [Son] Fucking, wanking, tossers. He swore again, Daddy! (brakes squealing) - That's it. You! You! Get out the car. - [Son] Mum, what's he doing? - Get out the car, Go! - [Son] Mum, help us! - You! Get out of the car. Go! Get out! Get out of my car! I will not have swearing in my car! Close that door! (intense music) - [Daughter] Daddy. Daddy I was only-- (intense music) (dog panting and whining) - [Mum] Look at you. - [Dad] What do you mean? - [Mum] Pathetic little man. - [Dad] What do you mean? I told him that he was not going to swear in my car. - [Mum] You just want to pick on that poor kid. Make him cry. - [Dad] What do you mean "pick on that poor kid"? - [Mum] 'Cause you can't pick on someone your own size, can you? - Come on son. - [Mum] Look at you. Look at you! - A joke's a joke. - [Mum] And that poor kid, look, crying down the road! - Let's go back and pick him up. - [Dad] Always contradicting me, you always contradict me! Whenever I tell those kids anything-- - [Mum] Why the hell do you think we have to go on these bloody-- - [Dad] What's it got to do with you anyway? Hey? Why don't you just shut up? (Mum screaming) - [Dad] Shut up! Shut up! (ominous carnival music) (car smashing) (slow ominous music) - [Grandmother] Can't you see that we need some help? Young man! We've had an accident! (slow, ominous music) - [Grandmother] What can you do to help us? What can you do to get us going? That's my-- the son's shoe, that can go in there. Don't take the stuff out, we're putting it back! We've had this nasty spill, we've got to get going. We're going on to holiday to Jaywick. - [Smart Alek] Yeah? - [Grandmother] Yes, we always go to Jaywick. - [Smart Alek] Shit there, innit? - [Grandmother] Oh, its a lovely place. We really like it very much. We all do! (ominous music continues) (Dad groaning) - Looks like you've had a bit of a spill, doesn't it? - It's these country lanes. They're really dangerous, you know. Aren't you the lad that shot at Mrs. Dixon? It's that tattoo on your neck. Don't touch me! - [Smart Alek] Shut up. - [Dad] Get the police. - [Mum] It's all right. (Daughter sniffling) - [Mum] Don't cry. - [Grandmother] What can you do to help us? - [Smart Alek] Get him out, just get him out of my sight. - [Grandmother] Can you get it going? - Go on, after him. - [Dad] I haven't got-- - [Grandmother] Don't worry. He'll be back soon. (car sputtering) (ominous music) (car sputtering) (sudden, sharp ominous music) (distorted scream) - [Grandmother] I never thought we'd bump into you. - [Smart Alek] Stroke of luck. - [Grandmother] You're a nice looking lad. You're not in the RAC are you? (Smart Alek scoffs) - [Grandmother] You're very smart. You could do a lot better for yourself. You shouldn't have to go around stealing from people. You could even get a proper job. - Yeah, I never thought of that. Get up, go to work, save up, go on a nice family holiday. Break down. Brilliant idea, lady. Stupid old bitch. - [Grandmother] What about your poor mother and father? - They're not poor. - [Grandmother] Don't you dare. - Leave out, will you! - [Mum] Don't touch us! - Just get 'em out, just take 'em over there. - What, again? - Just get 'em out of my sight. Go on! - [Grandmother] Don't worry, we'll be off soon. (soft ominous music) (intense, squealing music) Look, enough's enough, young man. - Enough's enough is it? - Me and my family, we're all on holiday, you see. And we've all got to be getting off soon. You can take whatever you want, but just leave us alone. - Leave you alone? You made me stop. I didn't want all this. (dog whimpering) - Oh. You think you're very smart, and clever. I think you're just a big bully. A silly little boy! And I'll tell you something else you don't know! - What? - You don't frighten me! - I don't frighten you? I don't frighten you do I? Feeling relaxed? I don't frighten you, do I? (grunting) (breathlessly) Enjoying a nice family holiday? (Smart Alek panting) Come on. Come on, you bastards move it! (recorder playing poorly) Come on you cripple! Come on! (men grunting) - [Smart Alek] Is it in second? - [Sidekick] No! It isn't in fucking second? - [Sidekick] No! - [Smart Alek] Fucking idiot, put it in fucking second. - [Sidekick Geez! - [Smart Alek] Put it in, come on. (ominous music resumes) Get out. Fucking get out. Push it! Push the fucking thing. Go on!
