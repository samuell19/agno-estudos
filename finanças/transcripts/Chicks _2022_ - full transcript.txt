Take your shoes off when you get inside. And don't forget to call me before you go to bed, ok? Yes Mom. Kiss your Mommy bye. Be good! (Tagalog) Yes. Be good. (Tagalog) Yes! POLLY'S HERE! Oh my god you came! YAY! Hi! Hi! Welcome to the party! Sleepover! Welcome welcome. Thanks for um inviting me over tonight too! Yeah of course, you don't need to be so polite about it. We have been wanting to hang out with you for so long! Like so long! Your house is really cool, Lizzie. Yeah we're into some pretty weird shit. Dinosaurs? My parents are into collecting, so... Are they home? No! We have the whole place to ourselves tonight. Which is perfect because... In honor of the first of many sleepovers with Polly... We're getting fucked up tonight! - Yay! I forget, do you drink Polly? Uh-not really. I just wanted to wait until I turned 21. Oh. - Aw, you're so cute! OK, we're all going to have some but seriously it's no pressure. No pressure! How can I say no to you guys? YES! Ok, Polly Pocket! That's the kind of energy we're trying to have tonight! We have so much fun planned for you tonight. Cheers to Polly! (singing) Try this on! - Me? Yeah! - It's like a mermaid! Strike a pose! And pose! And pose! Polly! Get up get up! Don't be shy! Yes! Wait I love it. You're so pretty! No stop.. Ravishing! Look at you! Round 2! Ready? 5, 6, 7, yes! YES!! One fluid movement, you know? I think I got this! That is it right there! Yes! Polly! Polly! Polly! (vomits) Oh shit. Polly? Oh my god oh my god ok. You're ok, you're ok! Turn the lights on! Ew ew! Shit! Fuck! Get out! Lizzie this is not funny, turn the lights on! It is a clapper, alright? Ow fuck! Lizzie I knew you made hers too strong! Me? You're the one who gave her a second drink. I didn't know if she'd taken enough for IT to work! This is so fucked! Lizzie do something! - I'm trying to think. (moaning) Oh my god... I'm so sorry guys! I don't know what happened... I just fainted and all of a sudden I-- Oh my god.. You're OK, you're OK. Just let it out... let it out. What is that?! Holy shit. - Oh my god. She's beautiful! - This is amazing. I just knew she was ripe! It worked! What are you guys talking about? We have to start getting her ready! We can't wait a minute longer. Mother will be so pleased! What's wrong with me?! Oh! Oh no no Polly, it's ok. There's nothing wrong with you. No, you have done so well. You're just perfect. What did you put in my drink? Something beautiful. I know it's scary but it'll all make sense soon. We promise. Trust us. We're your friends. Does that look good? Shit ok. I'll start putting feathers on this side. Feathers! No, Kelly! Are you fucking kidding me? - What? We don't have time for this! - But we're putting feathers on her! The more feathers the better that's what I thought. - On her arms not on her fucking face! She has feathers on her fucking face, they're right here! We literally don't have time for this! - What are you talking about, I thought that was the whole thing?! No! Stop throwing them and put them on her! I put so many on her!! I thought that was the problem, you guys didn't like it when I put the feathers on her!! (distant squawking) Mother, we bring you the gift of the pure. We have seen her innocence. Yes Mother, we've prepared her for you. Just how you like. We have her fruit, Mother. Please see for yourself. (large wings flapping) You live in fear, child. But you are among only sisters. All is love. You hold back... But you have more power than you know. Release your restraints. Let us be your wings. Do you wish to fly? I do. I do! My daughters! Rejoice for your sister. I do! She has chosen to see the light. I do. She baptizes in the blood of our sacred sisters. I do. Do you absorb their wisdom? I do! Do you bask in their power?! I do. I do! I do! Great ancestors of old! Awaken from your fossilized remains... Grant your flightless descendants the ferocity which you once ruled the earth! Give us your ancient power! I do! Give us your light! Polly! Polly!
