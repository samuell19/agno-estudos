They don't look near so high from the outside. For a time, we were afraid they weren't high enough to hold you in. If you're takin' a train, there's one leavin' Huntsville this afternoon. - Thanks, Chuck. - Good luck, Wes. Good luck. Good-bye. - Good morning. What can I do for you? - I'm Wes Hardin. - John Wesley Hardin? - That's right. I have a story here. Wrote it myself. It's about me. I think it might interest people. - I'd like to read your story, but-- - There's no hurry. I'm leaving town on the afternoon train. If you decide to make a book of it, I'd be much obliged. - Where can I reach you? - You'll find it in there on the last page. I have been tried for murder and condemned in a court of law. I have been tried by public opinion and my name connected with every major crime in Texas over a period of years. In the interest of truth and justice, I have set down the unvarnished facts of my life. My own story in my own words. Let people judge for themselves. I was born into a fine family in Fannon County, Texas, on the 26th day of May, 1853. With the outbreak of the war between the states, my childhood came to an end at the age of seven. My father raised a company to fight for Texas. My brother Dave was killed in Georgia. My brother Joe was crippled in Mississippi. The war ended, but peace didn't come to Texas. We were a proud people ruled by a foreign army: the Army of the United States. My father, J.G. Hardin, was a preacher and a circuit rider. He was a strong, God-fearing man who carried his Bible like a six-gun and fought with the devil wherever he found him. - Where did you get it, son? - I bought it. With gambling money. Don't back up, son. Not when a man is coming at you. I don't back up from any man... unless he was my pa. What would you do, shoot him with that pistol? You've grown strong in the house of the Lord. Yet your strength is the strength of the devil! I placed your feet on a path of righteousness. Yet you seek out the ways of sin! With the help of the Lord, I may yet conquer the evil in you. Pray for forgiveness, for mercy, for understanding. I'll pray for you. Jane Brown was an orphan. Her family had been lost in the war, and she'd come to live with us. We'd grown up together. Jane was about the prettiest girl in Texas. Wes. Oh, Wesley, he beat you again. Sometimes it seems like he enjoys it, whippin' and prayin'. Seems like the time has to come when a man doesn't take another whippin'! Even from his own pa! Even from the preacher in this part of Texas! I tell you, Jane, I'm going away. I'm gonna get me some money so we can get our own land. Place with green grass, real grass, for horses. - And water-- - That runs all year round. A white painted house. - Yes, I know. - You don't believe me. Wes, if you'd only be patient for a while. - Study your law books. - Law books! There's no more law in Texas. Only Yankee law! - It won't always be that way. - I'm tired of waitin'! There's a million head of cattle in Texas. Maybe more. Mavericks running wild on the range. Belonging to nobody because of the war. A man just has to round up a few cattle, brand 'em and drive 'em to the railroad. But there are thousands of men. Older men with money, horses working these mavericks. All I need's $200 or $300 for an outfit and a good cow pony. I can raise it. I got a plan, Jane. I'm goin'. Will you come back for me, Wes? I love you, Jane. I love you. Jane. Pa's wantin' his dinner. Wes, I'm sorry he whipped ya. I could hear it. Your brother's goin' away, Joe. It might be best that he does. I guess it's the only thing you can do, Wes. Pa just don't understand you. Jane! Joe! Come in the house! You better go now. Good luck, Wes. - You didn't answer my question, Wes. - I'll be back for you. I'll be waiting. Jane! Good-bye, Wes. Good-bye. Good-bye. Shh. Shh. - Who is it? - Wes Hardin. - Hello, preacher's boy. - Good evenin', Rosie. - Anyone see you come into town? - Nobody. - No Yankee soldiers saw you? - They couldn't see a white barn if it was in front of 'em. If they knew we were open after dark, they'd throw a lock on the door. - Hello, preacher's boy. - Hi, Gus. Out after dark in a place like this? If the Yankees don't get ya, the devil will. I can take good care of the Yankees, Gus. The devil will be busy with you. Marv, I'm back again. How much for the law books? - Same as last time. - I don't want a loan. I wanna sell 'em. - About ten dollars. - That's a lot of law for ten dollars. - The books are worth 50. - Ten dollars. Give him 30. - I'll give you 20. - Make it 25, you piker. Stay on your own side of the fence. I'll give you $20. Sold. Make yourself a lawyer. Now that you're in the law business you can start collecting debts around here. I sure will, soon as I read up on it. - What are you gonna do, Wes? - Gonna get me a farm. Buy me some stock. Breed the best horses in Texas. You figure you can get it faster this way... if you're lucky. Maybe I'm lucky. Who knows? Sit in. - What are you lookin' for? - How to collect I.O.U.s with interest. - You know what "interest" means? - Yes and no. - There's a lot of kinds of interest. - Yeah? Yeah. Take me, for instance. Yeah, I got an interest - in somebody that's got an interest in somebody else. - Oh. - How would you figure that one out? - Well, I-- Don't forget the kitty, boys. I'll take one. I'll buy two and check. It'll cost you 50 to play. - I got three kings. - No good. I got a flush. You gave me four clubs goin' in, and you just gave me this one. Where'd you get that card? You gave it to me. I gave you a heart. Why you! - Wes, look out! - Drop it, Marv! Put your hands up. You all saw it. He drew first. Get out, quick. He's got three brothers. They won't ask who drew first. Put my money in my hat, Rosie. Keep your hands up! Put it in my saddlebag. The first man out this door gets shot. Stay put till you hear me ride. Wes, look out! Take care of yourself, Rosie! Take care of yourself, preacher's boy! All right, line up. Come on, move. Up against the bar, all of you. It was murder, murder in the first degree. Habeas corpus. That means he's real dead. - What's the name of the man who shot him? - The name-- My name is Marv. Everybody calls me Marv. I've been tending-- Not your name. The name of the man who did the shooting. Lieutenant, I don't think he saw it. He couldn't see that far. You seem to see plenty around here. You see it? No, no, but he did. - Did you see the shooting? - I seen nothin'. Ain't seen my wife in a week. What time is it? Ah! Everybody's gone blind and dumb around here at the same time. Who runs this riding academy? - Who shot him? - Wes Hardin, the preacher's boy. - Who are you? - Ben Hanley. This is my brother. - Who are these two? - We're all brothers. Corporal, report to headquarters on the double. Tell 'em to alert all patrols for Wes Hardin. You, miss. You. We'll need you as witnesses. You ain't gonna need no witnesses, 'cause there ain't gonna be no trial. Uncle John! It's Wes Hardin. Well, hello, Wes. Step down. Come on in. Maybe I shouldn't. I'm in trouble. If you're in trouble, you've come to the right house. Tell me about it. Put his horse in the barn, Jeb. - Howdy, Aunt Em. - Good morning, Wes. - Wes. - Sit down, Wes. Have some breakfast. What kind of trouble you in, Wes? - I shot Gus Hanley. - Gus Hanley! You killed him? - Holy smoke. - You started up with that brood, you should've got 'em all. He'll get his chance as soon as they come runnin'. Especially Dirk. He's cut five notches already. Wes, what I say-- - You don't say nothin' till you're spoken to. - There's something else. I think I shot a couple of Yankees gettin' out of town. Yankees! What are you tryin' to do, start the war over again? - Yankees don't count. - But the Hanleys do. - Does your pa know about all this? - I expect he's heard by now. Joe, saddle the horse, go to Bonham and tell ol' Jehovah that Wes is with us. - John, that ain't a nice way to talk about your brother. - Half-brother! Pa don't have to know where I am. I expect he don't care. I cut loose from him before all this. Joe, do as I say. Keep off the road. There'll be patrols lookin' for Wes. Joe, when you see Jane, tell her not to worry. Tell her I'll be back for her like I said. You ain't goin' for a long time unless it's in a box. When I'm ready, I'm goin' back for Jane. We got plans, Uncle John. Don't matter about the Hanleys or Yankees or Pa. Let the Yankees look for ya. Let 'em all look, 'cause we won't be here. We'll be trailin' a herd to Abilene, and you'll be with us. - Ready to make a drive? - We can be ready tomorrow mornin'. - Can't we, boys? - We'll be ready sooner if you say so, Pa. - Joe? - Sure, Pa. We'll be ready. Good. Get back as soon as you can. Wes, what about Gus? He draw first? You beat him, huh? What do you think? He's here, ain't he? Hyah! Fastest horse in Texas. Howdy, Uncle John, boys. Why, if it ain't old Wes here with half of Texas lookin' for him. You're a real unpopular boy. You got the Hanley brothers looking for him, promising to shoot him on sight. Got half the Yankee army lookin' for him, makin' the same promise. Hey, Zeke, real good-lookin' pony. Must've cost ya plenty. Nah, didn't cost me nothin'. That Yankee major at the fort, he confiscated this horse from a ranch. All I done was confiscate him back. - You mean you stole him. - No, not exactly. Major wanted to play poker with old Zeke, so I obliged him. He got more cards off the bottom than he did off the top. I got Rondo! - Hello, Zeke. - Howdy, Joe. Roped in the last of 'em. Ready to go whenever you are. - Let's stop talkin'. Take 'em to Abilene, boys. - Run 'em along! Jeb and some of the boys are back at the wagon. That pony of Zeke's got a good rein. Quick as a cat. Here comes old Chick Noonan. - I wonder what he wants. - Probably lookin' for a place to bury his money. -Hi, John. Hi, Wes. -What are you doing on trail? Pick up stray business? I pick up business any place I can find it. Business was good in Abilene. I had a special embalming on the Durango Kid. If I say so myself, when he's laid out, his own wife didn't even know him. She thought he was a stranger asleep in the parlor. Uh, been any recent deaths in Bonham? No, not that I know of. Not to change the subject, John, but did you ever buy that new black suit? No. Why? Ya never can tell. They come in handy sometimes. Yes, sir, Rosie. I've buried 'em in Abilene, in Santa Fe, and I've buried 'em in old Mexico. But I always like to get back to Bonham to take care of my friends. Sorry I missed plantin' Gus Hanley. Only three days ago, I was as close to Wes Hardin as I am to you right now. - Chick, you're gettin' too sentimental. - Where'd you see Hardin? Why, four, five days ago on the trail to Abilene. Uh, he's with the Clemens outfit. Poor Wes Hardin. I wonder if he's got a black suit. - Then what'd you do? - Well, then I give him a real nice hand. - Then what? - Then I give myself a little bit better hand. That's how come I'm riding Rondo. What do you do, son? I'll open for 200. Two hundred? There ain't that much money in Texas. Yes, there is, Zeke. Right in my saddlebag. I'll get it. No, no, no need. I only got me but $20. You got Rondo. You got yourself a bet, son. - How many cards you want? - Two. I guess I only need one. Well, it looks like a showdown, Wes. What you got? Four aces! Why, I never gave you no aces! Yes, you did, Zeke. Two on the deal. I give you a pair of deu-- Looks like you lost yourself a horse. I'll be full-blooded to a ringtailed baboon! I'm through playin' cards. My luck's against me. You're luck's all right. You just need to practice up a little. I just need a new deck. Clemens' outfit hit town yet? Not yet. I hear they're due this afternoon. Clemens' boys hang out in here? We're just about the official headquarters for all the Texas outfits. This hour of the mornin', it's kinda quiet. - What'll it be? - We'll be back. Hey, Charlie! Run over to Marshal Hickok's office. Tell him Dirk Hanley and brothers are in town. You tell him yourself. I ain't messin' with Hanley or any of his kin. Hyah! Hyah! First thing we get into Abilene, I'm gonna get me a nice, cold beer. Scoops of 'em. Corn liquor for chasers. I'm gonna get me one of them nice, great, big 25-cent steaks. Then I'm gonna jump into a nice, hot tub and wallow around like an old sow in a mud hole. First thing I'm gonna do is call Madame Lucy, a French dressmaker, buy Jane the fanciest wedding dress ever been seen in Texas. Long white veil and big bows. Well, your poker luck holds out, you can buy half-interest in the bank. I don't want any bank. All I want is enough money to buy that horse farm for me and Jane. Hyah! Hyah! Zeke! I thought you and Wes was comin' over to the bathhouse. I tried to get him over there, John, but he couldn't wait to get into a poker game. - You been here ever since? - No, no. We went over to that dressmaker's. He ordered a dress. All satin and lace. Cost almost $300. - Why'd you let him come back here? - I couldn't stop him. Just a couple of hands, he says. Yeah. He almost lost all of his money right now. He ain't got enough to pay for that dress. If he gambles away Rondo, I'll-- ♪ I'll tell you All about our Nelly ♪ ♪ Nelly, the flower Of womankind ♪ Which one of you is Wes Hardin? Who wants to know? Got word for him from Dirk Hanley. Tell him we got word for him. If the Hanleys have come to Abilene lookin' for trouble with Wes, they're gonna get it. Take it easy, son. Wes is big enough to take care of his own quarrels. - I'm Wes Hardin. - Dirk Hanley says you murdered his brother, Gus. Says he's gonna kill ya. Says he's waitin' outside the saloon. Well, what do I tell him? I got no quarrel with Dirk Hanley. Tell him I'm not comin'. But... tell him I'll be waitin' outside if he wants to come and see me. If loudmouth over there is finished with his private conversation, maybe I can get on with my song. I'm all through, ma'am. It was real polite of you to wait. I was runnin' into bad luck anyway. Did you get good money for the herd? I'm gonna need some to pay for Jane's dress. No time to be thinkin' about any dress. What are you gonna do? - Like I said. - Listen, Wes. When he comes to you, stand still. Wait him out. He'll stop before he draws. ♪ All of the gentle... - Did you see him? - I've seen him. He says for you to come to him. He'll be waitin' for you. That's what I figured he'd say. All right, you know what to do. Goin' somewhere, Ben? Hold it! How much money do I have comin', Uncle John? About enough for Jane's weddin' dress. Lend me ten dollars, will ya? I feel lucky again. Told you I was feelin' lucky. - You're way ahead now. Let it go at that. - I haven't started yet. Hardin, you're under arrest. Hand over your gun. - Who are you? - The name is Hickok. So hand over your gun. There's two other Hanleys in Abilene, Marshal, so I'll be needin' my gun. I was plannin' to offer you a safe escort out of town. Thanks just the same. You're a brave boy, Hardin. I wouldn't like to have to kill you. You can have one hour to get out of town on your own. By that clock. Gunned down Dirk Hanley and backed up Wild Bill all in the same five minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if you lived to see 21. - Well, let's get out of here. - Not me. - You're pushin' your luck. - No, I'm not. I'm not going till I get Jane's wedding dress. - When will that dress be ready? - Tomorrow morning. Tell them that dress has to be ready in one hour. - John, we can't-- Go on! I want a weddin' dress - back here before 6:00. Come on, fellas. Come on. Jim, how about buyin' your dad a drink? I need one. Please, you got to get out of my place. Wild Bill, he will be back, ah, soon, ah? Go someplace. Go home. It's getting late. - Go home and sleep, huh? You tired? - Forget it. Have the girl sing it again. Give her this. Oh! Miss Richardson, that boy from Texas wants you to sing it again. - Again? What's the matter, is he hard of hearin'? - He's paying you for it. I'll sing as long as these keep rollin' in. Play, play! Sing a lot! Sing a lot! ♪ Open thy ladders Love, listen to me ♪ ♪ In the voyage of life Come on! Wes, here it is. Here's the dress. - Now let's go. - Hey. Huh? How's this? How do I know it's gonna fit her? - What do you want me to do, put it on? - Get somebody. Sylvester! - What's the matter? - Let one of the girls try this on. Put on the dress? Look at the time! We want to get him out. He wants to see how it looks. - Oh! Emma, come here. - Emma! Lola, Lola, come here, come here! Josephine, come over here! Hold it up there. Put it up. Wes, look it. - It's nice, no? You like it? - No. - Put it on! - Lola! Try it on Lola. She's a nice girl, eh? Eh? No, she don't look like a bride. Wes, look at this. Perfect. Perfect! That's nice, huh? - Let's see your feet. - Feet! - Nope, too big. - Ah! Look at the time! I figure it'll take just about one minute to fix that clock. Marshal, in one minute, I'm gonna be as far away from here as I can. Pick up my money, Uncle John. Wes! - Oh, Wes, you shouldn't be here. - I told you I'd be back. - Your father'll hear us. - Never mind. I've come back to marry ya. Look, Jane. We've got enough money to buy that farm. Just like I promised. Lots of pasture and trees. Wait'll you see what I brought you from Abilene. Look, Jane. - Oh, a wedding dress. - Try it on. - No, it's bad luck. - I want you to... now. It's so beautiful, but where did you get all that money, Wes? I didn't steal it. I didn't mean that. I've been lucky, Jane. Luckier than a man has a right to be. You mean, like when you killed Dirk Hanley? I heard. The Hanleys came lookin' for me. Come on, Jane. Let's get out of here and never come back. I got a bad feeling about this place. - But we can't go now. - Why not? Because I-- I promised your pa he'd be the one to marry us. - What'd you do that for? - Shh. Be quiet. - Wes. Wes! - Get out of my way. I'm gonna go talk to him. Wait, Wes. - He gave me a home. He has a right. - I know. I just have a feeling it's gonna be a funeral service Pa says over me, not a wedding service. If you go to an early grave, it won't be my doin'. It'll be God's will. Then I guess it's God's will I'm still here. He's had plenty of chances. Jane, get into some decent clothes. I'm not marrying you to Jane until you're free of the law. If I turn myself in, they'll hang me. Is that what you want? Hear me out! The Yankees are leaving, more every day. Curfew's been lifted. The only charge that'll be brought is the murder of Gus Hanley. It wasn't murder. He drew first. Then you'll get off if you have a fair trial. I'm gonna send for Judge Ames, the best lawyer in the county. What if you're wrong? What if I don't get a fair trial? If I'm wrong, I'll take up the gun and get you free. I believe you would. We're going to need the finest legal advice that money can buy. Now, I plan to bring Foster and Pratt down from Dallas. That's gonna cost a good deal of money. More than you have, I'm afraid. How much, Judge? - How much you got? - I got $1,200. You're at least $700 or maybe $800 shy. I'm very sorry, my boy, but the scales of justice hang in a delicate balance. There's nothing like money to tilt it our way. Now, you be at Sheriff Webb's office Monday morning. We'll be waiting there for you. Good day. There goes our farm, Jane, and he's not even sure he can get me a fair trial. You've got to raise more money, Wes, to make sure. - Any ideas? - I got one. I don't know if it's any good. That horse of yours, you said he was fast? They're holdin' some races over in Cullen County this week. I was thinkin', they wouldn't know about Rondo. - If you're lucky-- - I don't think you should go, Wes. There'll be drinking, painted women, gambling. And there'll be trouble. Wes? Please don't go. I'm not lookin' for any trouble, Jane. The way you wear that gun, you won't have to look for it. You'd be safer here. All right. I'll go without my gun. I'll ask Uncle John and the boys to come along. There won't be any trouble. I'm sorry to keep pickin' on you. I know you've had to give up all your money and plans because of me. We need that money, Jane. When I get back Sunday, I want you to be wearin' that weddin' dress. All right, folks, the third race is a sweepstakes. Winner takes all. All right, boys, let's get 'em up to their startin' line. Come on, come on. Let's get 'em up there. Come on. Get 'em in line, a straight line. Get in straight line. Not gonna start this race till you're in a straight line. Get that horse to the line. I won't start this race. Clint, get back! Get set! Go! Come on, Wes! Wes! Wes! How much is in the pot for the winner? - How much, Charlie? - Let's see. That's $385. Oh, and to think I had to lose that horse in a crooked deal. Don't forget, folks: All bets will be paid off at Jack Martin's Saloon after the last race. Hey, you! I'll bet you 500 against your 385 you can't outrun my buckskin. - You got yourself a bet. - So have you. Jeb, cool him off. Hey, Wes, $385 is a lot of money. You better be-- Put up your money, mister. Easy come, easy go. Wes, have a drink on the hearse. Thanks, Chick. Hey, Wes. Well, Rosie, you come up here by yourself? - No, quite a few of us came up from Bonham today. - Oh, yeah? Includin' Ike Hanley and Sheriff Webb. I guess that's why Chick Noonan brought along his hearse. Sheriff Webb's got no cause to make trouble. Ike Hanley has, and you're walkin' around without a gun. You're wrong, Rosie. I'm going back to Bonham and give myself up. After I get married to Jane on Sunday. You-- You're gonna buy a farm and settle down and raise horses, huh? That's right. There'll always be a place at the table for you. You'll make a fine farmer, and you'll make Jane very happy, wonderin' every day when you're gonna get killed. Don't worry about it. - I don't know why I should care about you. - Why do ya? Maybe it's because you and me are both the same kind. Livin' high on the hog today 'cause we don't believe tomorrow's gonna come. All right, preacher's boy, have it your way. Good-bye, Rosie. Wes! - Yeah? - Take care of yourself. I aim to, Rosie. - Who's that peacock? - That's Rosie McCoy, a friend of mine. - Where's she from? - Bonham. She works for the Hanleys. And you say she's a friend of yours? Best friend I have, excepting you. - Hey, what's goin' on there, mister? - Sheddin' a little weight. We'll shed a little weight too. Take her off, Jeb. If you're gonna ride bareback, you better put some glue on the seat of your britches. I'll be all right. You better get somethin' for him. He can ride frontward, backward, sideways and without a bridle. - What's goin' on here? - This fella fancies himself a rider. Yeah, wants to ride without a saddle. - Oh. - It's all right by me. - Fancy fella, huh? - Yeah. Okay. Yeah. How much money you got? - Hundred and a quarter... on Rondo. - Hundred and a quarter? All right, boys, let's get 'em up to the startin' line. I want 'em even. Steady. Get set. Go! Come on, Wes. Come on, Wes! Come on, Wes! Come on, Wes! Come on, Wes! $885. We'll take our money now, Judge. You'll take your money at Jack Martin's Saloon like everybody else. Well, we'll get it anyway. I tell you, I can't go through with it, Ike. I've known that boy all his life. What you mean is you're scared. Why not? He's the fastest draw in Texas. He ain't lookin' for trouble from you. - Just handle it the way I told you. - Yeah. Suppose he doesn't try to resist arrest. Here's 500 that says he does. Come here. Take a look. He ain't even wearin' a gun. Won't be a minute, boy. Be right out. - Where do we get paid? - Over here. Over here. Let me see your tabs. - Wanna count it? - Count it, Uncle John. She's all there. - Got your money, Wes? - I've got it, Sheriff. Then start walking. You're under arrest for killing Gus Hanley. You're a bit out of your territory, ain't ya, Charlie? It's legal. I'm making a lawful arrest. John, you keep out of this. Keep your hands where I can see 'em. There's no sense in your arresting me today, Charlie. You must've talked to Judge Ames. Ike knows about it. - Never mind the talk. - I'm not looking for any trouble here. Jane and me are gettin' married tomorrow. I'm not turnin' myself in till Monday like I agreed. And I'm keepin' my word. Come on, Uncle John. You're resistin' arrest. Whoa! Let's get outta here. We've been here long enough. - Where do you think you're goin'? - Back to Bonham, like I said. - That's the first place they'd look for ya. - I'm going to get Jane. Why don't you stop talkin' like a fool? You ain't goin' back. You're headin' for the Rio Grande right now. If he says he's goin' back for Jane, he's goin' back. I'm goin' with him. It's only a short piece. I can make it myself. Boys, go on back to the ranch. If a posse comes along, keep 'em talkin' as long as you can. Then send them on the wrong road. You understand? - Wes, you're hurt. - I'm all right. - What happened? - Charlie tried to shoot me. Ike Hanley put him up to it. I told him I'd turn myself in after the wedding, but he wouldn't listen. - So you killed him? - Yes, I killed him. And Ike Hanley too. You're a plague on the earth, John Wesley. Sure. Lots of people think that. There's a whole posse of 'em after me right now. But don't start praying for my eternal soul, not yet! I'm gettin' out of here-- clear out of Texas-- Jane and me. We'll get that farm, Jane, just like I promised ya. Sure, I know. The place with the white painted fence, the green grass and water. I don't believe that anymore. I don't think you believe it. No, you'll never have that place, not now. You'll never have more than six feet of ground. - Listen. - Because you'll never stop killing. I've never killed a man except in self-defense. - Why did you kill Gus? - I told you. He tried to kill me first! - And Dirk Hanley? - He came looking for me. Jane, we haven't got time. Uncle John's waiting on the other side of the creek. What are you trying to prove, that you're above the laws of man and God? Not God. Not His laws. Your laws, your whip. You never made me crawl. I was never afraid of you or any man. No, you're not afraid of anyone so long as you have a gun, so long as you can kill. Now you talk like him. If you'd come away with me when I wanted, If he hadn't interfered, there wouldn't have been any more killing. There'll always be more, because you'll always have to prove you're not afraid. - Now you're talkin' crazy. - How do you feel when you kill? Do you feel bad? Do you feel good? Do you feel good, Wes? Tell me. Tell me. I stayed too long. Wes Hardin! Don't open that door. What would you do, shoot me down too? - Who is it? - Bob Jenkins. I'm the marshal. Sheriff Webb's been killed. We've got a posse around the place. We want Wes to come out, or we're comin' in after him. Get away from the door. Don't, Wes. Don't! Put up your hands, Hardin, and come toward us. I'm stayin' right here. I killed Ike Hanley and Charlie Webb in self-defense and you all know it! You killed an officer of the law during the performance of his duty. You killed him while resisting arrest. - What are you gonna do? They catch me, they're gonna - string me up without a prayer. - I'll try to make the creek. - I'll cover for you. Go on upstairs, Joe. I'll try and make it through the back door. Pa! Pa! I heard the shots, Wes. Sure looks like you stopped some of 'em. Let's get over here. If I tied you on the saddle, you'd bleed to death before I went a mile. Over here. That's it. G-Get down there. Yeah. There. Here's his horse. I'll be right back as soon as I can, Wes. You'll be all right. Tell Jane... I'm all right. He's not around here. He must've taken to the hills. Hang on, Wes. This is gonna bite. - Where are we? - We're in the territory, headin' for Kansas. No. No, we're goin' to Bonham. I told Jane I was comin' back for her. We can't go back to Bonham, Wes. I told you I was goin' back to get her. No, Wes, no. There's no need for you to go back. Jane's dead. They killed her. They couldn't get me, so they killed her. Yeah, and if you go back, they'll get you. - Good morning, gentlemen. - -Good morning, good morning. Sorry to keep you waitin'. What I wanna know is how, in actual practice, the rangers can succeed and enforce the law, while the present sheriffs and marshals fail? Well, in the practical sense, the importance of a police agency like the rangers can best be illustrated by this man Wes Hardin. This notorious killer has escaped apprehension for six years simply by hopping from county to county. But with the rangers, they can pursue him anywhere on a statewide basis, and, with a little help from the governor's office, can go beyond the boundaries of Texas and bring this man to justice. Yes, Duncan? Gentlemen, you can tell your readers we'll bring in Wes Harding. Sure, Captain, but when? When? You'll read about it in the papers. Rosie? Rosie! - What is it? - Where's my boot? I can't find my boot. Here it is. Maybe you'd better hang it on your watch chain. Yeah. I guess I'll have to. - Goin' out to look for a card game? - Mm-hmm. The saloon on the corner seems lively enough. Where's my money? - Pretty thin bankroll. - Yeah. Well, it won't always be like this, honey-- running all the time, living with riffraff, rich in the morning, poor at night. - Someday we're gonna have a-- - Sure, Wes. A farm, with green grass, a white-painted house, and water that runs all year 'round. You wouldn't take that farm if somebody put it in your lap, tied up in ribbons. Why wouldn't I? How many times have you had enough to buy a farm twice over? We had $3,000 in Waco, and there was a time in Houston when you were $8,000 ahead. But did you ever even look at a farm, Wes? What are you trying to say? I'm tryin' to say I don't like your fancy dream. You hang onto it because it makes you feel better than the gamblers, the riffraff. Maybe even better than me. And I don't want you to feel better than me, Wes, 'cause I love you the way you are, the way you really are. One of these days, I'm gonna surprise you, Rosie. I'm gonna win me a wagon load of money, and then we'll settle down. Might even do it tonight. Feelin' lucky. Good. Might win enough to pay for dinner. And if I don't? We'll eat anyway. Grandma, what would I do without you? - Why, you big-- - I'll be back for supper. When did Mr. Swain check in? - Last night. - Thank you. - Who was the nosy parker? - From the sound of him, I'd say he came from Texas. - What did he want to know? - All about you and your brother. He's probably a business friend of my brother's. Then your brother must be doing business with the Texas Rangers. I saw a star under his coat. Raise $200. - I'll call. - Wes, Wes. A man just stole my diamond ring! He's still at the hotel. Hurry, before he gets away. I'm sorry, gentlemen. I hate to leave in the middle of a game, especially when I'm ahead. - Oh, wait a minute. I've got three kings. - I'm sorry. Three aces. Wes, Wes, never mind the money. My ring! My ring! I'll be back, gentlemen. - What is it? - Wes, the rangers, they're here. What would the rangers be doin' in Kansas? I don't know, but there's one of them in the hotel lookin' for ya. Get outta here, Rosie. There's gonna be some shootin'. - No, Wes. No. - Go back to the hotel. What is it, Rosie? All the time we've been here, and you won't even bother to unpack or hang up the curtains. - Complainin' about your housekeeper again? - Yes. Listen, Wes. I was born on a farm. My father marched away from a farm tall and brave, in a fine new uniform. I never saw him again. My mother died on a farm givin' birth to his son. I saw plenty of farms after that too. People sweatin' and diggin' their lives away. I saw 'em slavin' so they could save up a few pennies for that rainy day. It never rains, Wes; it pours. - It doesn't have to be that way. - Well, that's how it is. If the weather doesn't get you, the grasshoppers do, or taxes or the mortgage. State of Alabama starts a war with the state of Georgia. You get killed by some fool bullet meant for a general. So you never hope and you never plan because someday you might get hurt. If that's the way you want to say it. Well, I know a card game too. I know that if you want to win, you gotta take a chance. You gotta add something to the pot. - But you can't win, Wes, if you're holdin' my kind of cards. - How do you mean? I mean you, Wes. Now you have to sweat from sunup to sundown every day for a year to earn $1,000 if you're lucky. You used to be the kind of man who'd sit in a card game and win that much money in one night. Haven't you been thinkin' about that, Wes? Sure. I've thought all about that, but this farm is what I want! You want it now. It's new; it's a toy. And when you get tired of it, you'll wander into town, pick up a hand, - and have to shoot your way outta town again. - A man can change, can't he? Prove it to me, Wes. Prove it! Because you-- you got no right to ask me to change till you can prove it. Rosie! Rosie! Come here quick! What is it? Wes? What is it? Come in, Parson. Come in. Come in. Is this the bride? It sure is. My, what a pretty dress. And such a lovely bride. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God-- No trace of Hardin since you let him get away from you in Kansas City? - No, sir, and I don't think he's in Texas. - Why? These recent killin's don't fit his pattern. He's never been a thief or a bandit or a bully. I think the local officers just charge every unsolved shootin' to Hardin. He's a killer, all right, but he's brave and-- John Wesley Hardin has made the name of Texas stink in the nostrils of justice, and I want him brought in here no matter where he is. - Yes, sir. - His brother and uncle still live up near Bonham, don't they? - Yes, sir. - He's bound to get in touch with 'em or drop in on 'em. Yes, sir. We have a man staked out, checkin' every move and watchin' the mail. I'd like to take a run down there myself, sir. Good, but don't get too fond of him, Duncan. If you want to sing his praises, we'll give you a chance to recite a eulogy over his grave after we hang him. - Yes, sir. - That's all. Yes, sir. We'll bring him in, sir. All right. Bring him in alive, if you can. Hi, honey. I'm hungrier than a bear. Well, you oughta be. Your food's been waitin' an hour. Now it's all cold. Well, I'm sorry. The buckskin mare's been havin' a little trouble. And your corn puddin's all burned. I always promise myself I'd never try to tie you down, tell you when to come and when to go, act like a naggin' ol' wife. Well now, what's the matter? The corn pudding's not that important. The mare's about to have her foal. Well, horses aren't the only thing born on a farm, Wes Hardin. Rosie! You mean you-- Us-- If I'd have been a mare, you'd have known weeks ago. "...and we expect the baby around the end of October. I'm sure it will be a boy, and I'm going to name him after you." Women! Since when is the good Lord letting on whether it's boys or girls coming into this world? "We have a real fine farm here, and we both wish that you and Joe could come for a visit sometime soon." Maybe we could, Pa. Maybe next winter, after the boy is born. I'll be back day after tomorrow, Rosie. - Will you be all right? - Oh, sure, Wes. - Wes-- - Oh, there won't be any trouble, Rosie. I've been to horse auctions before. No, no. It's not that, Wes. It's-- It's somethin' I been wantin' to say to you for a long time. You-- you remember when I was bein' stubborn, - when I said I didn't think you could ever change any? - Yeah? Well, I was wrong. I know what's happened to me, and nothin's gonna change me back to the way I was, Wes; nothin'. Guess all a person needs is half a chance. I feel safe here, Wes, and-- and settled. And I don't care if I never see to the other side of the next mountain, 'cause this is where I wanna be-- with you. Sure, honey. I always heard women get nervous and fidgety around this time. They get their heads full of queer ideas. Well, you go right on talkin'. Wes! Hurry home! Oh, Dan, will you do me a favor and take him over to the livery stable? - Tell 'em I'll be back in a couple of days. - Mr. Swain, I'll do that. That's him. - Round-trip ticket to Pensacola, please. - Pensacola? Where's Dick Taylor today? He took the day off for himself. I'm filling in for him, Wes. Put your hands up, Hardin. You're under arrest. You're makin' a mistake, mister. My name's Swain. - Who are you? - A Texas Ranger. Now, I said put your hands up. Don't shoot! I want him alive! - You get his gun? - He hasn't got one. All right. Take him along. John Wesley Hardin, the jury, having found you guilty of the murder of Sheriff Charles Webb, it now becomes my duty to pronounce sentence. Frankly, there's no doubt in my mind as to what punishment you deserve, but this court, jealously guarding the traditions of American justice, refuses to sentence you in accordance with the demands of popular opinion. And again, we refuse to sentence you for other crimes which you are alleged to have committed, but for which you have not been tried. In the matter of the murder of Sheriff Webb, the prosecution has failed to bring forth any witnesses who saw the actual commission of this particular crime. Some of the alleged witnesses are dead; others have failed to come forward. Therefore, it is the sentence of this court that you be confined at hard labor for a period of 25 years in the state prison at Huntsville. Has the prisoner anything to say? Yes, I have, Your Honor. If you and the jury weren't afraid of public opinion, I never would have been convicted, because I shot Charlie Webb in self-defense, and you all know it. Maybe I did wrong. Maybe I deserve to be punished. But I'm not a murderer. I never killed a man who didn't try to kill me first. Take him away. Keep the place, Rosie, no matter what. I will, Wes. I promise. The little fella, Rosie, tell him-- tell him I never-- I will, Wes. I will. Wes! Wes! Wes! Wes! Wes! Wes! Wes! 25 years. Time enough for a child to grow up. Time enough for a man to think. Time enough to die. Today, on the 20th of March, 1894, in the 16th year of my imprisonment, I have received a full pardon from Governor J.S. Holgg. I append the document as an appropriate note on which to end this narrative. Henry Johnson! I've warmed your dinner for the last time tonight. What's keeping you? I was reading a story, Amy, a true story. What kind of a story is it? I don't know yet, Amy, because I don't rightly know how this story is going to end. Wes! Wes! Why didn't you tell us you were coming? I wanted to come home this way, Rosie. Kinda like I was just coming back from that horse auction to Pensacola a long time ago. Place looks fine, Rosie. You're lookin' so pretty, prettier than I remembered. I dreamt of you, Rosie, every night and every day for all these years. I dreamed of you for so hard that I couldn't rightly remember what you looked like anymore. I nearly went crazy tryin' to draw a picture of you in my mind. I know, Wes. I know. A woman dreams too. We tried to keep the place together, Wes. We-- we got some good horses. We whitewash the stables every spring, and we tried to get the house painted. Is that him? Yes. What sort of a boy is he, Rosie? John's almost a man now. He's worked like one since he was 12. He's been waiting a long time for this day. We both have. Hello, son. You must be-- Yep. Your ma said you were grown up, but... I didn't expect to see a man. Ma says if I keep on growing, I'll be as tall as you. You're strong too; you-- You've worked hard, haven't you, son? I don't mind workin'. Well, now that there's two of us, maybe you'll have time for some fun once in a while. Nice pony. Is he-- Is he yours? I guess he's rightly yours now. Well, you work the place, son. I figure everything here belongs as much to you as-- You ought to remember this, Pa; it's yours. Sometimes people come out here asking to see it. I keep it loaded too. This how you used to do it, Pa? How come you never put any notches on your gun? John, did you see your father? Where are you going? Wes, what is it? What's wrong? What did you say to him? I hit him, Rosie. I hit him. Why? Why? That gun! He put it on, and it was me 20 years ago, thinkin' I could lick the world with a gun. I went crazy, and I hit him. Oh, it'll be all right, Wes. You'll explain it to him. It'll be all right. I don't think it will, Rosie. He'll be out lookin' for trouble. Oh, don't say that. He's a good boy. - He'll be out lookin' for trouble. - What do you mean? It's happened before. It's happened to me; I remember. My pa and me. I'm goin' after him. I'm gonna bring him home. Hello, John. What can I do for you? A whiskey. I didn't know you'd started drinkin'. Have you seen your pa? Boys said they seen him come through town a little while ago. Look, I came in here for a drink, not to answer a lot of dumb questions. - All right, all right. - Whiskey. What makes you so tough today, Hardin? 'Cause your old man's home? - Figures the old man will back him up. - Why don't you shut up? Think you're man enough? Why don't you make me shut up? Maybe he'd show us his pa's famous trick of carryin' a gun under his vest so he can shoot a man in the back when he ain't lookin'. Better go on home, John. No sense starting anything with him. You know-- You know, if I was Wes Hardin and came home from the pen after 16 years, the first thing I'd do is unlimber my six-gun, start bangin' away at the nearest target. 'Specially if I was comin' home to a swell lookin' woman like Mrs. Hardin. Easy, son. Easy. You stay out of this. It's my fight. There's not gonna be any fight. Here's his gun. Keep it. All right. The boy's not armed now, and neither am I. So see that you don't shoot off anything but your mouth. I'll take care of you another time with a horsewhip. - Come on. - I ain't afraid of you, Hardin, even if you have got a gun under your coat, so draw and fire! What did I tell you? Did you see him reach? - Gimme my gun! - No! Don't give it to him. Somebody get Doc Barker. I thought you said he had a gun. He reached, I tell ya. You all saw it. He was wearing a gun under arm when he killed Webb. Now, don't try anything. - I'll get him for this! - No. You're not gonna live the way I lived and end up like this on a dirty floor. It'd be my fault, son. Don't you understand? Leave it alone. He'll get his. But you leave it alone. Swear to me! I swear it, Pa. I swear it. Keep him quiet for a couple of weeks, Mrs. Hardin, and he'll be all right. - I'll come out and have another look at him this evening. - Thank you, Doctor. - Now, John, you drive real slow. - Sure, Ma. Remember the last time we rode in a wagon, Rosie? Long time ago. Yeah. This time is different, Wes. This time we know where we're going. - John! - Yes, Pa? Let's go home.
