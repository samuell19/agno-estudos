Turn on the lights! Where's the doctor? Where's the doctor! Doc! Doc! I can't see. Turn the lights on. Turn the lights on! I can't see. Turn the lights on! Turn the lights on, please! I can't see. Where's the doctor! Doctor! I can't see! Turn the lights on! Nurse! You can't do this sir! Turn on the lights! Doctor! Please take me to an ophthalmologist. Please! Help me! Where's the doctor! This is a lie. Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Episode 5 That one is better. How much is that one? $4 for one. Give me two. You want that many? They are not for me. I'm going to dry one, and I'm going to cook the other one for my son. Jang Il. Jang Il! What are you doing here? You didn't call. Did you get something? Sun Woo is awake. I heard. They say he is not in his right mind. Don't go see him. Did you have lunch? You want to go eat at home? I have to go to school. I will call you when I get there. Jang Il. I heard you're taking the Bar Exam this year. Don't worry about anything else and just study. I'm going. Don't even think about visiting here. I will visit you often! I'm never going back. Sorry. Ji Yeon! It's red light. I will help you. I'm ok! Slowly. You're across. Thank you. Take care. Sun Woo. Wake up. I like them. There is no pot for them. Over there. Where should I put it? I will do it. What's wrong Sun Woo? Did you have a nightmare? Are you awake now? Soo Mi, where are the flowers? What flowers? Did you have a dream? I will tell them to untie this. Just hang on. Soo Mi! Where are the flowers? Where am I right now? Is there anyone next to me? What's wrong with my eyes? Do I not have eyes? I can feel my eyes moving! I can see in my dreams. Why can't I see when I open my eyes? Soo Mi! Soo Mi! Soo Mi! Sun Woo. How are you feeling today. Did you wear your necklace to impress me? It's dazzling. Yeah, I wanted to look good. Let's change. Sun Woo. Put it on again. It's backwards. Also... You want to wear this? No. There are 9 steps. There are 13 steps at the top. I can do it alone from here. Kwang Soo and Soo Mi went to get groceries. There was nothing to eat. Are you ok? I can do it alone. Ok then. Stay here for a bit. I will go to Kwang Soo and Soo Mi real quick. Are you home, Sun Woo? Sun Woo! Who is it? Oh! You're home. It's me. Jang Il's father. I went to the hospital. They said that you were discharged. I brought you some rice cake. How are you doing? I'm fine. Jang Il is very worried about you. Jang Il is...? Do you remember? He was in my class. How did you know about this place? Jang Il told you about my place? We're neighbors! Of course I know. I even bought you chicken, remember? What's wrong? Are you ok? Sun Woo! Shouldn't you go somewhere to get help? I will ask Father if I can go. Father? Oh yeah, my father passed away when I was little. I get forgetful after getting hurt. Sun Woo. Rest well then. Are you crying? I left the rice cake at the door. Eat it when you're hungry. Why are you crying? I will pay for all my sins. Please just leave Jang Il alone. Please! Please leave Jang Il alone... The federal courts of the U.S. only allow assisted suicide when the patients make clear and willing statements that they want it. For example the Cruzan case of 1990, it respected the rights of the patients to refuse treatment. It also states that there must be clear and convincing evidence that the patient wants it. Without such evidence, even if the guardians want to stop the treatment, the federal court ruled that it's constitutional for the states to not allow this. You could say that they weighed the value of life more. I believe that they respect the existence of a human life. Even if his or her conditions won't improve, rashly taking someone's life is never allowed. I also agree with this ruling of the court. He was discharged, but I'm still worried. They say he has a chance of seeing after a surgery. But the chance is slim. It's also really expensive. Whether he gets surgery or not, he will have to go to Seoul. He has no one there. How will he live there without his family? You want him to live in his room like that until he dies then? He needs to find a way! I don't know what he remembers last. He doesn't know how he got into the accident. He thinks that his father passed away when he was little. I don't know if that's a good thing. What do you mean? Nothing. At least he has savings and insurance. When he got the savings and the insurance money, I almost dropped into tears. What is this? It wasn't here. Someone must have come. Sun Woo! Did someone come? Is it the lady downstairs? Lee Jang Il that bastard. How can he not come when his friend is hurt like that. Lee Jang Il came. When? The day Sun Woo was shouting and panicking. He was at the hospital that day. Sun Woo never mentioned it. Maybe he couldn't say hi. It was a mess that day. Doc! Please take me to an ophthalmologist. Please help me. Why did you do that, Jang Il? We were friends. Why did you try to kill me? Hello? Sorry to call you late. It's me, Chae Soo Mi. How did you get my number? Sun Woo had a note with your number. What's up? Did you see him that day? Sun Woo can't see at all. I don't think he should be left alone like that. There is no rehab center here. He needs to go to a city. Do you know a place in Seoul? How would I know that? I have no idea. I'm just trying to hang on to any thread of hope here. Sorry. How is Sun Woo doing? His memory is unstable. He remembers your name, but he doesn't remember how long you've been friends. He remembers my name? Yeah. He only remembers that you were close. Lee Jang Il. Don't feel too bad about Sun Woo getting hurt. Some things are just inevitable in life. It's not in our power to stop them all. Blaming yourself for something you couldn't help is just foolish. You just have to go on with your life. Don't hurt yourself over it. Cheer up. Sorry you call you this too late. Good night. Sun Woo! Do you remember the cabin you built with your father in the woods? The landlord of the land wants the cabin out. He was being very lenient because you got hurt. I think there was one. Cabin in the mountain. Just tell me what to throw away and what to keep. I will take care of it for you. It's good that you remember it. I can smell the woods. You came here often. You even fought me here too! Although you kicked my ass. Sun Woo, come by 6 on your birthday. What's wrong? I was going to see my father here. I remember. I was going to see my father! Hey! Hey! It's dangerous! Dad! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! When are you going to the police station? I will go tomorrow. It's gone. Let's go to the police station together. It's better than going alone. I will go to your place tomorrow morning. Forget about your father. Sun Woo! Don't go! I beg you! I killed your father! Let's just say that your father died because of my mistake. So just forgive me. Don't go to the police station. Sun Woo! Are you ok? Are you hurt? Sun Woo! Sun Woo! -A son? -Yes. He said that he was going to see his son. That's why he postponed his schedule to Europe. Where to? I couldn't find that out. I think he is very subtle about this with just two secretaries. Long time no see, sir. I will stay in Seoul more often from now on. Please take care of this place for me. Don't worry sir. How is Jang Il doing at school? He is doing very well. What happened to that kid? The kid that got into trouble. Oh... How is he doing now? For our Seoul branch location, I'm looking at one place above the river and two below the river. None of them perfectly suit our demands. Is he out of his mind? Sun Woo, the cab is here. Eun Hye! I get cold easily. I'm cold during fall, and I'm cold during springs. But it's funny... I never feel cold after meeting with you. How did someone like me get to know someone beautiful like you? Eun Hye, I'm scared that you will leave me someday. I get selfish to have you by my side forever. I feel like I have a flu these days. Hey! This is my hometown friend. Eun Tae Joo. He went to Sang University in Seoul. I depend on him a lot. I think I'm pregnant. What should I do? I will tell him. No! You can't tell him. Stop the car. The wind is very cold sir. Secretary Cha... Yes sir. When was the most heart-broken time in your life? I don't know. What was yours? No such thing. I just erased those from my memories. They were only weighing me down. Let's go. Sun Woo! Open the door. You're not up to something stupid, are you? Hey! What are you doing inside? I'm going to have to sleep outside in a sleeping bag then. Get out of the way. You! Are you going to starve to death like this? Sun Woo! What's wrong with you? You just can't remember. You were a very strong man. This isn't like you! If you're going to die like this, why did you ever wake up? Please don't do this Sun Woo. Hey! How is Sun Woo doing? He's been acting strangely ever since he fell in the mountain. Gosh... Are you really a fortune-teller? Shouldn't you have foreseen something like this coming? You should have made him avoid this! You little... Just sell your business. Brat! Everyone takes the big dip in the life once. Everyone gets into an accident like that? Sun Woo just happened to go through it earlier than others. Everyone will go through it once. Try to live a few more years, and you will know. Stop jinxing me. You will be heart-broken three times because of girls. I said stop! After your 40, you will get a disease too. -Shut up! -Take them back! I take them back. I'm going to call Jang Il to come from Seoul. If a close friend comes to comfort him, he could get better. Are you going to die? Good thinking then. Why live? You have fine arms and legs. You have the fine looks. And your beloved ones come all the time to take care of you. Why live? You might as well just die. You don't remember running everywhere to write a petition? You said that your father had an unfair death. And then you just fell from a cliff and went blind. Was that really an accident? What if it's not an accident? Do you know something? Do you know how I got into an accident? You don't know how you got into it, how would I know? Let's just say that it was an accident. Sun Woo! You never know what's going to happen in life. Even fire that went out will be lit again. No flower blooms all four seasons. Everything will fade. Just when you think it's over, something good can happen. As long as you don't give up, it can happen. You're just pretending that you can't remember, huh? Get out. Just because you can't do anything right now, it doesn't mean that you can't do anything forever. -Don't forget that. -I said get out! How scary. Fine, I'll leave. I'm leaving. When your memory comes back, you have to take back what was taken from you. How is it? I'm about to throw up. Was 5 too tight? Mrs. Kim! Hello! How are you doing? I haven't seen you for a long time! Thank you for the invitation, Madam. It's an honor to have you here. I saw Mr. Jin at the golf course during the weekend. I haven't seen his face for a long time. We bought another club. I heard. Congratulations. Come to our place sometime for a cup of tea. I got fabulous tea china from Denmark. If you like them, I could give them as a gift. Oh dear, I should go then. They are just like the ones you can get on the streets. Oh... In that case... They are perfectly for my taste. Really? They are colorful. Are you interested in investing in funds? Sun Woo, do you have more for laundry? Give all the underwear and socks you've got. Don't be shy just because they have holes. Jang Il must be worried. What did you just say? -I said Jang Il must be worried. -You remember Jang Il? Of course I remember him. He was my best friend. Yes! Do you remember how he got into a law school? Did he? That's impressive. I should write a letter to Jang Il. How are you Jang Il. How are you Jang Il? I'm doing well. I'm writing to you because you must be worried. ...must be worried. I was hurt, so I couldn't call you for a long time. I'm fine, so you don't need to worry about me. Oh yeah, I heard that you made it to the law school. Congratulations. You will be a very successful man in the future. Take care. I will write you again. -Your proud friend, Sun Woo. Send it before the post office closes. Ok. Oh yeah, I forgot the most important sentence. Jang Il, I remember everything. I think I know why you did that. I can't forgive you. Even until the day I die, I'm not going to forgive you. Jung Eun! Hi! Is something wrong? You look angry. This elective is driving me nuts. Social Welfare of the Contemporary Culture. -What's wrong? -I got caught for doing attendance for someone else. Are you getting an F? He told me to write a report if I don't want an "F." I have to go to all the welfare offices. It's going to take all the time that I need. -You want me to go saying that I'm Han Ji Won? -Sure! You have to drink coffee with me 10 times. I can't sleep if I drink coffee. -that a "no" then? -Of course. Why don't you come to the library these days? Did you look for me? Not really in particular. I was in the Law School Library. I had a group study. Did you miss me? Not really. But I do check the face of the people who are drunk and throwing up on the streets. See you again. Thank you. 6 on every Thursday. In the hopes of you having time at least once every two months. Did you check the mailbox? You've got mail. Really? How are you Jang Il? -Your proud friend, Sun Woo. Lee Jang Il, I'm the one writing this. Sun Woo spoke and I wrote it for him. He must have remembered you. Sun Woo still thinks of you as his best friend. Come over when you have time. Milk tea today. I made English black tea. Put in more sugar. Are you interested in mining business? Someone Mr. Ko knows invested in some mines in Indonesia. -He made a lot of profit. -I will do the business. I told you that I will open a gallery for you. There is a Korean business man called Moon Tae Joo. I heard that he is exceptional at what he does. We should get close to him too. Invest in him. Let's stop talking about business. What's wrong? Others miss this because they don't get to the sources early enough. I heard that he has very good business insights. I said stop! You just heard some crap rumors. Investment? Mom! Are you crying? Why this out of all china? The whole set is meaningless without that. Do you know how hard it was for me to get this? Why this? You could have thrown a glass. I know how you feel, but comfort her. I'm sorry. I will buy you a new one, stop crying. Kids! Isn't it your nap time? Is it time for your nap? Lee Jang Il must be really busy. We even wrote him to come here once. He's not calling us back. I'm going to go see him myself. I will ask him to come for Sun Woo. Sleep well? You didn't drool, so don't worry. What's wrong? James Dean comes out in Roman Holiday? -Bye! -Yeah, see you. I will see you tomorrow. Lee Jang Il. Long time no see. What's up? I came to see a gallery. I came by to see you. I have something to tell you. What is it? Are you busy? Say it. Here? I want to talk about it somewhere quiet. I have to go somewhere. What is it that you have to say? I want you to come to see Sun Woo. If a close friend comes to comfort him, it may help his recovery a lot. I thought he got better. He even sent a letter a while ago. If he's well enough to write a letter, you're not ever going to see him? If you stay with him for a few days, it will help a lot getting his memories back. I will try to go. -Thank you. -Ok. You don't even have time for a cup of tea? I have to go somewhere. Ji Won! You didn't go to your class? I missed you so much. I asked the professor if I could leave. I'm busy today. I won't take too much of your time. Are you hungry? I'm a little hungry, but I really have to go. Nah, please eat with me. What do you want to eat? Really? Who is it? That's more like it. Let's go to Seoul, Sun Woo. We can't be by your side forever. What you want the most right now is to see again. When you can't have what you want, you must do what you can. When you do that, you can get to an answer. For me, it was art. Ok, let's go. Sun Woo. I have to find a way too. Let's go to Seoul. Really? You made the right decision. Thank you, Sun Woo. You made the right decision. Geum Jool, go to Seoul tomorrow and find a room for Sun Woo. What do I know about Seoul? Fine then. Let's all go together, stay in a motel, and then find a room. Jang Il is at Seoul. And? Ask Jang Il. Ask him if we could stay until we find a room. -Really? -Yeah. Of course! Of course he can stay at my place. Tell him to stay until he can find a room. Tell him not to worry about a thing. Easy! I want to see it for the last time. The gate is corny blue. The paint is coming off. There's also a note saying "Newspapers Refused." What about Mr. Park's magnolia? It still has a few flowers. The "No peeing" is completely gone from the wall. Steps! Steps! The mountain you can see from your steps is green now. Last one. Down hill. Be careful. Not this. Why not? Do it! Dad. When I first met you, I was as good as dead. If I have the will to live again, it's all for you. I restarted all the will and emotions related to you. I try not to hide anything from you. If your feelings towards me ever change, I only hope that it happens for the best. Then I will just have to go back to my place. But if you don't change, I will protect you with love that I felt for you at first. Unless you allow it, I will never look at another man. I also love you. January 16, 1846. Yours Truly, Elizabeth Brown. Sun Woo. Jang Il. Fool! Long time no see. Jang Il! Are you really Lee Jang Il? Yeah, fool! Can't you recognize my voice? Look at you! You look so much better. I like your place. Let me drink some water. I have it in the fridge. Soo Mi! You can use this room. Geum Jool, you want to sleep with Sun Woo or do you want to sleep in the living room? I will sleep in the living room. That way it's easy for me to go to the bathroom. You must be tired, take a shower and go to sleep. We can talk tomorrow. We will find a place as soon as possible. Sun Woo worried a lot if this will be a big hassle for you. Hassle? This is nothing for a friend. Thank you, Jang Il. Don't thank me. Sun Woo! You said that you were thirsty. You want water? I can go. Sun Woo! I said that I will get you! Why move? You weren't asleep? Yeah, I have a test soon. Why aren't you sleeping? I'm tired, but I can't go to sleep. It's because you're new to this place. You want a cup of milk? No, it's ok. Drink it. Aren't you going to drink it? Jang Il. Yeah? You don't have the loaners coming anymore? That's not going to happen again. Don't worry. When was the last time we saw each other? I don't know. Where did we see each other last? Was it a BBQ place in the market? I think we had pork BBQ and Soju. We even drank together? You don't remember anything? No. I remember saying that I will pay for your tuition. I'm sorry that I can't help you, and I'm only a burden to you. Don't say that. Stop saying that and just drink milk. It's still hot, I will drink it when it cools. Sun Woo. Do you not remember, how you got into the accident? The only thing I remember... is that it was very cold that day. That's all I can remember. Jang Il. Did I say that I was going to the police station? I don't know. They say that I got into the accident after saying that I will go to the police station. I think people are fooling me. It's ok, Sun Woo. No one will fool you. Don't worry and sleep well. So what does this man look like? He looks a lot like me. He is handsome. I'm going to take my son to the U.S. And? I will make him the best man in the world. I have to go because of my exam. Sorry, let's eat something good for dinner. Looks like Jang Il left in the morning. Yeah, I heard him leave. Sun Woo, let's eat. A place like this must have cost him a fortune. How much do you think it cost? He came to Seoul on a scholarship from Chairman Jin. -You didn't know that? -A scholarship is a scholarship. He couldn't have got him an apartment too. Is the apartment nice? Yeah, it's really big. It's new. This is a very expensive neighborhood in Seoul. Did his father loan money again? How did he pay the money back? Teng Bo never came to school after that. That snake... Drink some coffee, Sun Woo. Did you hear that? This is the front gate. Let's go. Grandpa! Can people live without love? You're still young. Some things are best not known when you're young. Grandpa, can people live without love? Grandpa embarrassingly nodded. My tears suddenly drop down. Thank you. Hi! You don't remember me? Are you talking to me? How did the accident happen? I got hit in the back of my head. I think Sun Woo is recovering his memories. Are you afraid? You never helped anyone or got help from anyone? Don't do anything stupid. It's all in the past. I'm your legs now. Be my eyes for me. Han Ji Won, can't you just like me?
