(suspenseful atmosphere music) - When I was a kid, I had so much hope, you know? I had so much to look forward to. I kept getting older. And those things, they never came. I kept waiting, but they... They never came. - [Tobin] And how'd that make you feel? - Like I was drowning, like... I don't know, like I forgot how to come up for air. (tense atmosphere music) Couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. - [Tobin] Why do you hate yourself? - I don't like who I am. - Is it because you're a coward? - What? - Because you don't have the guts to live? You're not man enough? Are you too weak? Are you too weak, huh? - No. - No? - No. - No? No? - No! No! - There he is. Yeah. You can't win when you're the enemy. You'll lose every time. Did you see how quickly you started to believe in yourself once I was saying you were too weak instead of you? - Yeah. - Life is about overcoming. It's part of the process. Now do you trust me? - Yes. - You're gonna fight for your life? - Yes. - Louder. - Yes! - Tell the whole world! - Yes! (cheers and applause) - All right boys. Go for music. (uplifting atmosphere music) - There's always going to be something trying to push you down, you push back. And if you can do that, you can take your life to places you'd never imagine. I'm not gonna say it's gonna be easy because life's not easy, but that is what makes it great, that's what makes it so fulfilling. Are you ready to begin your new life? - [Nelson] I am. - [Tobin] Say yes to this. - What's his story? - That's John Kirby. Salesman, mid-thirties. Kinda a non-believer, but he wants to be. Claims he's got problems sleeping. - Put him on the list. Tell me about her. - Vicky Boyd. A single mother, this is her fourth time here. - Fourth time and she never got time with Tobin? - Nothing on our file. - Yeah, well we'll deal with her on the floor. Third row, fifth chair. Woman with long hair and glasses. What's his story? (tense atmosphere music) - It was... It was life-changing. This has been the greatest day of my life, no question. - [Victor] Great job today, Jefe. - You think so? - Absolutely. So do you have time to talk about the candidates for the retreat? - I trust you. If you like them, book them. - [Victor] Danni? - Yeah? - [Victor] We'd like to talk to you about an exciting opportunity. - To me? I'm sorry, what is this about again? - [Interviewer] You don't have to get defensive. - I'm not. - [Interviewer] Okay, so did you try and kill yourself? - I don't know. Have you ever tried to kill yourself? - Yes. And then I found Tobin. - Eight years ago, I was sitting right where you were sitting. Back then, the seminar was all there was. But today, I'm offering you a new opportunity. You are the lucky ones. You've been chosen. - So how much does this cost? - Tobin has waived the fee. - What's this failure to comply clause? - Well if you were to choose to leave, well then you would owe the full cost of the treatment, the 75,000. - Okay, so if we don't wanna stay, we wanna go, we owe you money? - Yeah. (chuckles) - Okay, well I don't know that I can do this. - Oh. We really thought that you were ready to say yes to this. - Of course I am. - I think you're not. And deep down, I think you know it too. - Okay. Well congratulations everybody, I'm... - [Arthur] You're lucky people. - So. Who is ready to say yes to this? (dramatic atmosphere music) - [Victor] Leave the luggage please. Follow me up here. Let's go. Nice fresh air. Could you please line up over here? Take a picture of you guys. (peaceful atmosphere music) - Figures. - [Victor] Can we have everyone in the living room please? - So how do I look? - Like someone who's ready to say yes. (applause) All right, first thing's first. I need everyone's cell phones. You'll get them back at the end of the retreat. Cutting off from the outside world is essential for your growth in here. Beth? - Oh, I didn't bring mine with me. I figured we wouldn't be able to use them anyway. - [Victor] That's very intuitive of you. - Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be distracted. - All right. Who's ready for stage one? (tense atmosphere music) - Come on in. Please have a seat. Welcome. We're about to begin a very special journey together. This will be a place where you can share everything. Revealing ourselves to each other is essential for the success of this process. Now none of you are alone. You're part of a team. So there can be no distractions. No mysteries. So what I'd like you to do is disrobe and place all your clothes to your left along with all your preconceived notions. - Are you serious? - I know it feels weird, but we need to peel away all those tensions so that we can expose ourselves to the most vulnerable amongst each other. - I just don't know if I'm comfortable with this. - Beth, the point is to not be comfortable. - Well I just don't see how that's supposed to help us. - Okay, why do you wear clothes Beth? - What? - Why do we wear clothes? Anyone? - It's just what you do. - Okay, but that was a choice we made. We decided to wear clothes why? - Doesn't feel like much of a choice to me. - Exactly Danni, we've become so entrenched in society that we don't even realize, but most of what we do is compulsion. But we can still choose. So why do we wear clothes? Somebody give me an answer. - Adam and Eve were cast out of Eden and covered themselves in their shame. - Yes Matt, shame. I say what is shame worth? What do we get from shame? Shame is a choice that we make. So tonight let's make a different choice. Let's go against shame. Not to objectify, but to purify amongst each other. This is a leap of faith. Trust me, trust the process, say yes to this. - But it's freezing. - Fucking spare me! Rebirth is not for the faint of heart. Did I choose winners? Oh shit, did I choose quitters? Which one did I choose? The files that Victor's presenting to you is everything we have on you. Some of which you've given us. Most of which we've dug up on our own. There are no filters, just facts. Look around. For the next few days, these are your brothers and sisters. This is your family. Now you'll read the file, then introduce yourself to the group, tell us what you're here to do, then cast yourselves into the fire to begin anew. This is stage one. I'm not gonna call names. We can sit here all night. You have to choose this. (nervous laugh) - Hi, I'm Danni. I want to feel like I'm in control of myself. - Self-control is an eternal struggle. I think we can all relate. Your focus should be discipline, values, and self-esteem. - Hi, I'm John. - Who? - I'm John. - I can't hear you. - (laughs) I'm John and I'm very very cold. (laughter) - Funny. - I'm here to learn how to say yes. Not just as a slogan, but as a way of life. I would like to be less timid. - Sometimes the way to be less timid is to not say yes as much. It's to learn how to say no. - Okay. Well then I wanna learn how to say yes to saying no. - And that would help you wouldn't it? Know when to fold 'em, right John? - Yeah. Right. - [Tobin] That way saying no protects people, wouldn't you say? - I would. - Balance, judgment, and thinking of others. That's your charge. Now cast your old self to the fire. Come on. Rock paper scissors? - (sighs) Fuck it. Hi, my name is Matt. I love long walks on the beach, getting caught in the rain, and standing naked in front of strangers whilst proclaiming my life goals. - (laughs) Well you came to the right place. - I don't really know why I'm here, I feel like I just need to be here. - Bzzzt! Try again. - Nah, I'm serious. I just, I need to find out what I need. I wanna stop being such a fuckup. - Amen! - But Matt, you served our country. How can you consider yourself a fuckup? - Not if you knew what happened over there. - I do. - No you don't. - If you're still out there, we need to bring you home. Forgiveness, self-worth, and goal-setting. Think the fire's getting low. And then there was one. - Hi everyone, I'm Beth. I would like to learn how to be perfect. You teach that here? (chuckles) - Let me ask you a question Beth, do you own or lease a car? - I own one. - Okay. But what if I was to say I'd give you a brand new car, same make and model as the one you have, but the catch would be you would have to give me your old car. Would you do it? - No. - [Tobin] Why not? - Because I like my car. - [Tobin] Why? - It's been a lot of places with me? - But I'm sure it has some problems. I mean there's gotta be normal wear and tear. So the other one would be in pristine condition. - Yeah. - So what we're talking about actually is peace of mind. Your old car might have some problems, but to you, it isn't broken. Conversely, the new one, if I gave it to you you'd be thinking about the old one. So it's actually the new one that's broken right? - Okay. I get it, so you're saying perfection is subjective. - No Beth. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I'm unhappy. Because I need to have peace of mind. I have read all your files. I know who you are, who you think you are, and who you want to be, and I see four people here, yet I only have three cell phones. So one way or another, I need to have peace of mind. And I'm going to get it if you help me. Will you help me, Beth? - I told Victor-- - I know what you told Victor. Honesty is the first step towards everything. Burn the file. I am not your friend. I am not here to lie to you, or to cheerlead you. I'm here to change you. I am your guide. I am your future. When a broken bone is not tended to properly it needs to be rebroken and set in place in order to heal. I'm proud of you all for handling that pain. Now we have a chance to heal. You're free to go to your rooms and get dressed to your comfort level. Tomorrow, we begin fresh. The rest of the evening is yours. - Thank god guys, they brought us some booze. (chuckles) - Do we have any bourbon? - Why yes they do. Matt, Danni, what can I get you? I used to be a bartender. - Just make it two. - Perfect. And Matt, I apologize, I am a lazy bartender. So you get bourbon as well. Matty! (laughs) Okay. Cheers? - Cheers. - Cheers. (tense atmosphere music) (laughter) (glass breaks) - Fuck! - You're bleeding. - [John] What? - You're bleeding! - I'm gonna go... I'll go clean it up. Hi, hi Danni. - How's the arm? - Well I'll live. (chuckles) - Yeah, well let me take a look. - See? No big deal. - Good. (tense atmosphere music) (sobs) - (gasps) What are you doing? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry. - Just get out. - Listen, listen, you're not gonna tell anybody right? - Just get the fuck out! - Okay, okay, okay, okay. (shuddering) Are you okay? (sobbing) I'm sorry, Matt. Come here. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry. (dramatic atmosphere music) (sharp inhale) (sharp exhale) (blender whirring) (timer beeps) (knocking) - Looks like you all got a little carried away last night. That's good. Means you're coming out of your shells. That being said, each day we have to begin anew, and your physical health is just as important as your mental health. - What's in here? - Just some help for your hangover. Tools to keep you at your peak. Essential minerals and vitamins. - That's a miracle. - Why are all ours different? - (laughs) The question man. I can respect that. - Different age, build, gender, and race. These have been carefully calculated to fit you perfectly. - I think I'm just gonna hold onto mine for now. - I think you should take them. I think you should take them. My mentor's name was a guy named Angelo Derose. Who created the Derose Foundation in 1964. You might've heard of him. Passed away about 10 years ago. When I first started working for the organization, I rose up the ranks quickly. I was assigned to be an evaluator. For big people. Powerful businessmen, politicians, A-list celebrities. A lot of them are still my friends, yeah. I used the same principles that I use today. That are made to shift you from your paradigm. And get your mind not focused on your problems. So let's just say a high-powered businesswoman would come in, and I'd say sit down, tell me about your problems. And she'd start rattling them off, you know? My husband hates me, I don't like my job. You'd see her actually shrink in the chair, posture down. And right in the middle of it I'd have this glass of water on the table. Right as she's talking, getting really emotional, I take the glass of water, I throw it right in her face. And she'd freak out. What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing? I'd say calm down, sit down, sit down. She'd sit back down, I'd say all right, tell me more about your problems. I can't! I can't even focus. And then it would click. I'd see it click. She had this other emotion now. Anger. And she couldn't focus on her problems anymore. We choose what we want to focus on. Last night, folks, was the glass of water in the face. I felt bad about doing it, but it had to be done. Now we can move on. Let's walk. - What's in there? - Stage two. (tense atmosphere music) - Hey Tobin, I think Matt needs a minute. - [Tobin] He'll be fine, Matt's a fighter. He'll catch up. - Hey. Are you okay? You still got those pills? Look, I'm not gonna tell you what to do or anything, but I think they're good. - I've had to take things and they didn't always work like they were supposed to. - I get that. But I actually think Tobin knows what he's doing. - You sure about that? - I haven't been sure of anything in a long time. (dramatic atmosphere music) - [John] How are you feeling? - Surprisingly not that bad. I gotta get Victor's recipe. - Right? So... Do you remember much of last night? - Honestly, it's all a bit blurry. What about you? - Yeah. Yeah, I don't remember anything. - Feeling better? - Yeah. What happened last night? - I guess a lot of decompressing. - Well I'm not judging, so. - What do you mean? - You know, you and John. - What if we did? Would that make you jealous? - No. - You sure about that? - Trust me. - 'Cause I saw you looking at me when we had to strip. - Is sex your thing? Is that why you're here? - Are you calling me a slut? - No. No, I'm just, you know, just thinking about the files from last night, you know? Hey look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything. Really, I'm sorry, all right? - Yeah. Okay? That's why I'm here. I just can't control it and it scares the hell out of me. I don't know what else to do about it, you know? - I mean I'm sorry, it's not really any of my business. - It's fine. What is it Tobin said? I guess we're all brothers and sisters now. (chuckles) What? What's so funny? - You had sex with your brother last night. - Oh, I guess I did didn't I? (laughs) - Oh man. - What are they laughing at? - I don't know. - What's wrong? - I don't know about this. I feel like it's bringing out the worst in me. - What'd you do that was so wrong? - Why do you think Tobin chose us? - Isn't it obvious? - No. Not to me. (distant laughing) What the fuck at they laughing at? (sighs) (tense atmosphere music) - Life. Death. Winning, losing. What do these things have in common? Risk, they all involve risk. Say yes to this. - [Group] Yes. - There will be sacrifices. What are you willing to sacrifice if you want it bad enough? In the face of danger, what are you made of? - Wait, what's going on? - You don't believe in training wheels. These pistols are loaded. (gunshot) - Jesus! - No Beth, this has nothing to do with the divine. This has to do with right here, right now. What kind of fear do you possess? Every day, we walk out our doors, we face fear. (nervous laugh) - All right, okay. - Criminals, diseases, natural disasters. Any one of those things could wipe us off the face of the Earth. So why is it that when someone we've entrusted our souls to has a gun, we're so terrified? - Please, he can't... - Huh? Maybe, maybe it's because we live with fear every day and we've become so numb to it that we don't even realize it exists? - Please! - Maybe. - Don't pick on him. - Good. It's okay, buddy. Stage two is about evaluation. We need to find where the fear exists. Take it! And what we can learn from it. You must work together. Danni must get to the end of the path. And you three must hit those targets. The exercises will continue until we learn what we need to learn. You three fear the gun, so now you have the guns. Danni here trusts me. She trusts the process, but she can't trust others, so her life is now in your hands. (tense atmosphere music) (gunshot) You ever fire a gun before John? - No. - Try again. (gunshot) There you go! Damn, just like a pro! All right. (flashback gunfire) (gunshot) Great job, soldier. Man, it's just like you're back out there in the desert. Fantastic. You're doing great, Danni. Stay strong. (gunshot) Try again Beth. - I know what I'm doing, I've shot a gun before. - Oh bullshit. You gonna lie to me, you'll be the next one out on the range. Now do you wanna shoot or do you wanna make up a story? - I wanna shoot. (gunshot) - [Tobin] Whoa there, Beth. - You're almost there. You can do this. - I got it. - You don't wanna quit do you? - No. (gunshot) - What the hell are you doing huh? - I didn't, that's not where I was aiming! - You nearly fucking killed her! - Matt, lay off. - Or what John? Or what? She did that on purpose and it's not funny! Why'd you do that? - Matt! - You want all the attention, is that it? Is that it Beth? Is that what you want? - Matt. - Guys stop, John! John! Stop! (gunshots) - Now what did we learn today? (dramatic atmosphere music) - [Tobin Echo] Maybe, maybe it's because we live with fear every day and we've become so numb to it that we don't even realize it exists. (gunshot echos) (dramatic atmosphere music) (moaning) (camera clicking) (wood creaking) (camera whirs) (knocking) - [Victor] Report to the treatment center. - Right now? But there was nothing on the schedule. - [Victor] Life doesn't wait for your schedule. It's time for stage three. - I can feel your apprehension right now. And that's great. You're raw. This is the fire. Say yes and it will galvanize you. - We're ready, Jefe. - Stage three requires your utmost honesty. This is a lie detector. And each of you will be connected to it. - Wait a second, you can't-- - I understand your fears. But trust me, this will be the greatest thing you have ever done. Beth, you're worthy. You're worthy of attention. Of friendship. Of love. Not the you that you present. The real one that's inside. And we are gonna bring that out. This is the hot seat. Each of you will have a chance to sit in it. Now while you're in the seat, you will answer every question asked by your peers. Now you can answer any way you choose, but if you choose the path of dishonesty, we'll all know it. Let's begin shall we? Care to guess who goes first? - So what do I ask her? - Anything you want. She's an opened book for you to read. - Okay. (clears throat) (nervous laugh) Hi. - (chuckles) Hi. - Are you nervous? - Mmm-mm, no. (detector buzzes) It's okay. I'm nervous too. So where you from? - New York. (detector buzzes) - Okay. Are you a woman? - Yes John. - Okay. Do you sleep at night? - [Beth] Most of the time. - Are you a vegetarian? - [Beth] Yeah, I am. (detector buzzes) - Why would you lie about that? - I'm not. (detector buzzes) - I don't care what you eat. I'm just, I'm asking you these questions because I have to. - Yeah, I know that. - Okay, so why would you lie? - I'm not! I'm not lying! (detector buzzes) - See? What the fuck? I'm trying to be really nice here and you're just... Being rude. - How long does this have to go on? - We'll know when it's time to stop. - Okay, I want it to be time to stop right now! - That's the first thing you've said that's true. So you're here for lying. - What? No I am not! (detector buzzes) Guys, seriously, help me get out of this please! - Why do you lie? - I don't lie! (detector buzzes) - Is it even a choice or is it a compulsion? - I don't know what you are talking about. (detector buzzes) Please just help me. - Don't even think about it cowboy. - It's despicable. You do it because you think people will like you? - Fuck you. - How are they gonna like you if they don't know who you are? - Stop it! - If you're afraid. Of the person that you are. - Just help me. - Did you put us together on purpose? - Everything we do here is on purpose. - I thinK I know why you lie Beth. - I... - See this? I'm not married. I mean I was. We're divorced now. That was the first time I've said that out loud. If I take it off, it means I'm admitting that... I was such a pathetic husband that my wife abandoned our vows. That being with me one more day was not worth living. - Why did she leave you? - It's this gambling. - But it's not the gambling is it? Is it? - It is. - Bullshit! Don't you stop now when you are so close John. - When I was a kid, I had a lot of energy. People didn't know how to handle it. I'd get in trouble. My mom didn't like that so much. The first time I did anything, she put me in the closet for an hour. That was every day. Just to remind me that I was a bad kid. One day I was pushed in line for lunch by this kid. And I beat him so bad he had to go to the hospital. I spent a week in the closet. When the doors finally opened, I heard two men from Child Services. The next place wasn't that much better. - You're an animal, John. You're an animal. Do you understand that? And you've been locked in a cage for so long. It's time to get out. It's time to let that animal out of the cage and go free. (tense atmosphere music) - Why do you lie Beth? Why? - Because you can't tell people your secrets. - Why not? - Because they'll stop loving you. - You can talk to us. - He never loved me. He never even knew that I existed. - Your father? - He didn't give a shit until I started lying. - And that fixed everything didn't it? But it didn't fix you. You needed to be loved by others, so you figured the only way you could do that was to... - Lie. - About what? - He was cute and I liked him. He was nice to me. He was really sweet to me. - [Tobin] And? - I invited him over one day after school. And then daddy walked in the door. And he just looked so disappointed. So I screamed. I just screamed. - And what did you scream? - Rape. He's raping me. - Where is he now? - I don't know. (detector buzzes) He's in jail. - Are you jealous of Danni? - Yeah. - Why? - Because getting attention is just so easy for her. - Life is not always how it seems. - When we had the pistols, did you aim at her? - (clears throat) I did. But it was just for a second. I just wanted to see what it felt like to have that kind of power, but I aimed away, I didn't pull the trigger. - You swear? - I swear. - And now it's time to stop. - Matt, you're up! Report to the chair soldier. That's an order. - I think I'm gonna sit this one out. - Did you forget you signed a contract, Matt? - Pretty sure it doesn't mean I have to do what you say. - Oh you sure about that private? - Stop that. - What's with the resistance? Why are you scared to get better? - I'm not. - Great, okay then, sit in the chair recruit. - Make me. - You know I'm already in your head don't you? - Fuck you. We're not your toys. We're human beings, this is fucked up. - Why? - Are you serious? You're torturing this poor woman. Humiliating her with her worst nightmare. - Facing your fears is the only way to overcome them. - What about the guns huh? You put Danni out there in front of live firearms. - No Matt, it's okay, it wasn't real. The guns weren't loaded. - No. Beth's wasn't, mine was. I know what a bullet feels like when it leaves a gun. I watched it fly. I know what I felt and I know what I saw. - I repeat, facing your fears is the only way to overcome them. - I'm done with this bullshit. - No. What are you running from huh? How many people did you kill over there? It was your job. Why do you blame yourself? Wait, I am not through with you yet! Matt! (door slams) Fuck! Good work everyone, we're done for tonight. - [Danni] What the hell's this Victor? - Every problem requires a unique solution. And Tobin's the master. - But what do you think is happening? - I don't know. I've never seen him act like this. Let me go talk to him. I'm sure he knows what he's doing. - You guys, there's something really wrong here. - Okay, well should we go look for Matt? - No. Give him some space. - I can't do this. - Come on. You knew what this was. You knew it was out of the box and you knew it would get real. Shit just got real. I gotta say it feels good. - [Danni] What? Are you kidding me? You're buying into it? - [John] You're not? - This is bullshit. - Honestly John, this feels really good to me too. - Yes. Yes it does. (nervous laugh) (tense atmosphere music) - Good morning everyone. - Where's Tobin? - He got an early start. He's gonna meet us out there. Daily supplements for you. - (laughs) After last night we don't need a drop. - A drop? - Of alcohol? Aren't those for hangovers? - I make a new batch every day. We want you at your best selves. - Hey guys. Really excited to be here. Arthur, from seminar? - Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I just didn't expect to see anybody new. - Bottoms up. (dramatic atmosphere music) So has it just been an amazing weekend? Getting to know Tobin? Did you feel changed at all? - Do you think this means Matt's not coming back? - You think they even know where he is? - I mean it's just been awesome right? - I don't know. (coughs) - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You guys should see yourselves. You look crazy. (laughs) When life presents you with a demon you have two choices, you can kill it or you can join it, but when the demon is inside of you, you have to bend it to your will. (coughs) It's still a demon. But it's your demon. You're a beautiful demon. I give life, I save life. So in turn, I must take it away. (distorted audio effects) You can't choose your demons. It's random, life is random. So when a demon presents itself, it's the luck of the draw. This morning a demon came to our camp. It came in disguise in the form of a pill. (violent coughing) (demonic voice) And now. You can choose to let it destroy you, or you can purge it and you can get stronger. Do you understand? Banish the demon Danni! (vomits) Good girl. Trust is a currency. It is not blind obedience. It does not overrule precaution. That is the lesson for today. Level four is about reflection. So please return to the treatment center for your next exercise. (wind howls) (tense atmosphere music) - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - I'm sorry. - So Arthur, are you staying in the nuthouse with us? Probably taking Matt's room right? - (laughs) No, I'm staying at the treatment lodge. It's the price you pay for late arrival right? So how's the retreat going? - Hard to say. Intense. For sure. Beth? - Yeah, I think it's kinda hard to explain. - Could you try? - Well we've covered a lot of ground really quickly. - Hmmm. Are you healed? - Yeah, I think I'm getting there. - That's good. And how about you Danni? - I'm sorry, how do you know my name? - Oh, well Tobin said it. - Oh. Yeah, maybe. I guess I was pretty out of it. - Do you believe in Tobin? - Maybe ask her after she hasn't just thrown up, man. - I'm sorry, I'm just really exhilarated that you were chosen by fate to take a step forward today, and I just wish it was me. - From my side, it doesn't seem so exhilarating. - But you changed today. - I was poisoned, okay? That's not progress, that's just fucked up. Matt! - Hey. - Hey, I'm Arthur. - Yeah, the guy from the seminar, yeah. - Where have you been? - I'll tell you over a drink 'cause I could sure use one. I ran for what felt like hours. I tell you, we're out here guys. There's nothing but woods for miles. And the further I got, I just kept thinking back about you guys, you know? If something had happened to you... It reminded me of a familiar place. A place that I did not wanna go back to. I'm not that guy anymore. I just knew I had to get back to y'all. - I thought we were never gonna see you again. I'm happy you came back. I think we all are. - Me too. But look, we need to go to Tobin, and we gotta tell him enough is enough okay? We're done with this. - Are you sure about that? - You're not? - I'm not. Tobin's made a lot of really good points. - Jesus, Danni, are you the only sane one left? - Yeah. - Guys, something's wrong here right? - What do you mean? - Listen, it's nothing personal man, but I don't know you and you haven't been around long enough to understand. In fact I feel sorry for you. - What are you trying to say? That Tobin's actually trying to hurt us? I mean you can't mean that. - Is this what you expected? I mean we've all been to his events, we've read his books. I mean how much more is he gonna push this? He put a live gun in my hands. How much further is he gonna go? - I mean he said this was a new program, so. - What is the one thing that we have all in common? - None of us have people who would miss us. Yeah, I thought about that too. - We all just have to be careful, okay? (tense atmosphere music) (knocking) - Hey. - What's up? - Take a walk with me. - Okay. Is this about the other night? - What? Oh. - Because I've been meaning to tell you that I am sorry. That is not who I wanna be anymore. - No, you don't need to say sorry. I completely understand, that's not you. - Thank you. That means a lot. So why are we here? - Arthur. - Yeah. (tense atmosphere music) - [Arthur] They're getting close. - Then it is time for you to prove your commitment. - [Arthur] Whatever you require. - Good. Soon your pain's gonna go away, my friend. - [Arthur] Yes. Thank you, Victor. - [Victor] Is there anything else to report? - [Arthur] Well Matt is back. He's creating dissent among the group. He's making them question Tobin. - Hang in there. And stay focused. We're keeping an eye on Matt. - Couldn't wait for the next stage could you? (suspenseful atmosphere music) Could you? You made some really good progress, but I think it's time we skipped ahead a few steps. Don't you? - You're hurting me! - Oh come on, I thought you were the tough one. - [Danni] Ow! - Now you're ready for the final stage of transformation. (music intensifies) (gasps) - [Matt] Danni, you okay? - I... I can't move. - [Matt] Me neither. - They have cameras. - Victor. What the fuck? - (demonic voice) Everything leading up to this moment is in preparation for tonight. - Fuck that. Let us go. (menacing laugh) - It's impressive, huh? It's just a special mix I created. You've made some good steps. But you've become a little too resistant. - Tobin. - (demonic voice) We've brought who you are, and who you want to be, to the forefront of your subconscious. And tonight, you will allow your conscious mind to take control of your deepest thoughts and desires. - What do you want from us? - I want you to get your life together. Or get the fuck off this Earth. Self-enlightenment through substance is a centuries old tradition. The Native Americans had peyote. The Amazonians had ayahuasca. And the hippies had LSD. We've created something better. More focused. - If you think that I am taking anything... - Beth. You've already taken it. Since you have gotten here, I have made it clear that I am not your friend. I am your enemy. I am your demons personified. Now will you rise up? Or will you crumble? (otherworldly noises) - Looks like we're alone. What do you wanna do to me? What if I said you could do anything you wanted? Please? Really. Please? - What are you doing? - I'm scared. - What makes you think I care? Wait. Did you think we're friends? - I'm sorry Matt. - Nobody here cares about you, don't you get that? I think you know that deep down. - Stop it. - You're just a slut. A lowlife. If I was you, I'd kill myself. But you failed at that too didn't you? - Stop it! - I only fucked you because I pitied you. And I regret it. You're disgusting. - Stop it! (heavy breathing) (sobs) (demonic voice) I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! - [Tobin] (demonic voice) Come and meet your destiny. I will not tolerate weakness. The weak are a plague that must be pure of light. I save life if it's deserving. Are you storing life that is unworthy? (Danni screams) (otherworldly growls) And this is the path. - [Arthur] Lucky people. - So there I was, lost in my own ignorance. Thinking erroneously that there was no way out. But Vance changed all that. I was stuck in love with the next wife who was emotionally abusing me and taking away my power. Tobin taught me how to take my power back. And now she's gone. - [Group Member] Do you guys still talk? - No. She passed away. - You see, you can't look at hunting as a hobby or a passion. It's a ritual. It's an exchange of life and death. When the animal is killed, there's a rebirth inside of you to accompany that death. I learned all of this from Tobin Vance. He allowed me to see my true inner self. He gave me the tools necessary to become the man you see before you now. You know what? You should take a seminar. If you mention my name you get 30% off. - I knew that as soon as I stepped under those lights on a sound stage I was exactly where I was supposed to be. Because Tobin's training taught me that I just had to embrace my inner self. Ever since I was a little kid I was lying to create my own reality, so you know, what was I supposed to do? Continue screwing up my life? Or just focus it into something positive? And what I really needed was to find my confidence. So now I get to make up new personas for other people to enjoy. And we just got picked up for a second season for the sitcom. What's really exciting is that I've gotten the majority of the cast to sign up for Vance seminars. - After all these years of marriage and I can't get to get through to you-- (gasps and screams) - What the? What the fuck was that? - What were you just complaining about? You can't remember right? Because that wasn't the real problem. I was like you once. Believe it or not. I needed help too. I thought I was my enemy, but I was wrong. That was a lie I told myself to keep from dealing with my real problems. Hidden behind my fear, insecurity, weakness. But then one day I learned it was all a choice. And I found my way through it. Do you wanna know how? - I'm here today because Tobin Vance saved my life. You're here because you want guidance. You're here because you wanna make a difference in your life. You're here because of Tobin Vance. So let's bring him out! (cheers and applause) - Let's make some magic today shall we? You have a problem. You don't know your own power. But that is not your fault. You don't have anybody else to blame so you blame yourself. Life is about overcoming obstacles, but when you're the biggest obstacle, you lose either way! Finding your purpose should be your number one goal. And you can't do that unless you identify your enemy. But when you can rise up, and you can beat that enemy, the possibilities are limitless. You can rule the world. You took the first step. You came here today. Say yes to that. - [Crowd] Yes! (cheers and applause) - Now tell me. Right now. How have you changed? (dramatic atmosphere music)
