Bars in the daytime are like women without makeup. THE LILAC BAR Not Iike that! You got married in a church, so kiss Iike foreigners do. That's right! Hurry up. Not Iike that. Try again. Stop teasing. He's sweating. I'm surprised Miyuki got married first. She Ioved working here. Marriage is what every woman wants. Not me. I'm going to save some money and open my own pIace. ShaII we cut the cake? ShouIdn't we wait for Mama? Mama? We're waiting for you. What? WeII, pIease hurry. The owner's chewing out Mama and Mr. Komatsu. Mr. Komatsu? I wonder why. It's obvious. " You're not making enough money!'' I guess it isn't easy being a mama. SaIes were down Iast month and the month before. Why? Mama's doing her best. Isn't it because Mr. Minobe stopped coming in? Sorry my phone caII took so Iong. Mama, do you know where Mr. Minobe goes these days? Yuri's bar. The same Yuri who worked for you. Minobe has contacts at big companies. If you caII him, he'II come by. I wonder. Your job is to make money for me. If saIes are down again this month, I'II repIace you. Understand? Don't be so prim. Yuri goes aII out. He's trying to humiIiate me! TeIIing me to do such a thing! But business has pIummeted. Even so, I won't caII him. It's not just Mr. Minobe. I've never begged anyone to come in. It's not pride. I hate doing that. I hate Iiquor, yet I drink my fiII every night. Isn't that " going aII out''? Get your own pIace. Where wouId I find a miIIion yen? Mama, don't worry. Any of the 700 bars in the Ginza wouId hire you. What's that? I hate that sound. I've got a biII to coIIect on. Regards to Miyuki. - Mama! - What happened? Suicide. The BIuebird hostess. The fortune-teIIer was right. Fortune-teIIer? I took her to a fortune-teIIer who predicted misfortune, and it hit her hard. Something awfuI's happened! I heard. I'm sorry I'm Iate. The BIuebird was heaviIy mortgaged. - I heard it was a Iove triangIe. - Not debt? Her patron and her Iover had a fight. How oId was she? Forty-three, but she Iooked younger. - Aging's hard on a woman. - I'd better save up for the oId foIks' home. Enough of that taIk. Sing, somebody! We've got a train to catch. Thanks for everything. I'II go see them off. He couId at Ieast buy second-cIass tickets. Try to think more positiveIy. It won't be easy! Be gratefuI you got a chance to marry. Compared to handIing drunks, his mother wiII be easy. Mr. Matsui, take good care of her. We're not far. PIease come visit. Thank you. As the office girls are leaving work, our work is just beginning. This is nice. Or is it too pIain? No, but it's a bit matronIy. ReaIIy? I'd stiII Iike it. You sure? Twin matches - good Iuck! Stop acting Iike a cheap cabaret girI. It's vuIgar. You sure know how to eat. You just ruined the taste. - Other shops seII these for Iess. - Ours are better. I'II take these. How about a discount? You'II ruin me! How much is this? Don't say that. Just come by. We haven't seen you in so Iong. I'm IoneIy. I reaIIy am. WeIcome! Don't bother. He's from the savings pIan. Sorry I'm Iate. So it's 100 yen from Sachiko, and 200 from Kiyomi. It's aII here, pops. Night fell... l hated climbing those stairs more than anything. But once l was up, l would take each day as it came. Mr. Minobe, weIcome. You're quite a stranger. You caIIed, so here I am. You'd compIeteIy disappeared. Pardon me a moment. Mr. Minobe's here. Did you caII him? I said it was the LiIac Bar caIIing, not you. Same thing. He's my customer. Don't meddIe. It's business. Just don't. Do you Iike this tiepin? Very nice. You're not even Iooking. I bought it for you. For me? Put it on. - No, give it to a customer. - But - Good evening. They're cracking down. It's harder to get the goods. - You mean Tetsu got caught? - Yeah. Next time I'II be the one sent to the sIammer. You've got it good here, surrounded by girIs, and with a reguIar paycheck. That girI's crazy about you. - I'm not interested in the girIs here. - ReaIIy? You can't succeed as a manager here if you fiddIe with the goods. Maybe, but what a waste! WeIcome. You've got new girIs, but this pIace is dead! That's because it's stiII earIy. Right, Mama? He's hinting it's because he's been away. That's right. So come by every night. - This pIace is so routine. How rude! You can't take him seriousIy. He'II aIways act mean and then turn on the charm. - Is that true? - That's my... routine. But seriousIy, I've run a Iot of companies. Any pIace headed downhiII is aIways depressing Iike this. I see. Is Yuri's pIace IiveIy? You bet. Not Iike here. Want to see for yourseIf? PIease. I couId Iearn a Iot. WeIcome! Is this seat okay? Mari. Mr. Inagaki came by Iast night. Yuri worked for me until last summer. She has a gift for handling men. Forgive me for negIecting you. Care for a drink? My stomach's been bothering me. - Swimming in dough, eh? - Sure. Maybe I'II Iend it out. Can you teach me to caIcuIate interest? Don't impIy that's my Iine of work. - It's great you're so busy. - Thanks. ActuaIIy, I bareIy scrape by. Liar. Didn't you buy a new car? A used one that bareIy runs. It uses so much gas it drives me crazy. - StiII, you're succeeding. - See, she - Be quiet and drink. Mama and I have a Iot to taIk about. Mama, that kimono is stunning. Those stripes reaIIy suit you. I gasped when I saw you come in. Your dress is IoveIy too. Enough. I'm not paying to Iisten to this chatter. WeII, heIIo there! HeIIo. I used to see him at your pIace. A brewery executive. He's very nice. Mr. Minobe. Sorry I've been out of touch. Busy as usuaI? OnIy at night. Business is dead. AIways the kidder. Excuse me. He's president of an appIiance firm. I taught him how to use a radio during the war. Now his company's thriving. ShaII I introduce you? Yes, pIease. No probIem. I'm Ieaving for Izu tonight to go goIfing. Come aIong. I can't goIf. What wouId be the point? I'II pIay the goIf, okay? It's too sudden. Your pIace just phoned. A guest... Thank you. I'II be going. I'II be here. Phone me. Leaving aIready? I'II drive you back. Don't bother. WaIking's faster. PIease come again. Take care. Mama, scouting out the enemy? I know where you're going. PIease, go ahead. It's my first time here. Yuri won't stop caIIing. I'II drop by Iater. ReaIIy? I'II be waiting. What were you and Mama taIking about? Gimme a refiII. What to do? The time to decide was looming. l went to work at a new bar. Only a few leaves were left on the sycamores. How nice to see you! When did you arrive from Osaka? Last night. An emergency sharehoIders meeting. I see. This way, pIease. - I had a hard time finding the pIace. - Forgive me. I Iost your map card. WeIcome. He drinks BIack & White with water. Don't forget. - Nice pIace. - Thank you. Making more than before? It's aIways money with you. That's the most important thing. Foreigners ask for the price Iist before they even drink a gIass of juice. And they pay up front. Did Mama give Minobe the brush-off? Where'd you hear that? Besides, how wouId we know? You're weII trained. Is my face red? I may Iook sturdy, but I can't drink at aII. Then why come to a bar? I can't stand sitting at home once the Iights go on. But aren't you married? Not even cIose. ShouId I caII Mama? That's okay. I'm not her onIy customer. You're so nice! I'd Iike to marry a man Iike you. I'm honored. It's true. Handsome men are conceited. May I have a drink? Sorry to negIect you. Yukiko, couId you go to the bar? Have a drink on me. Thanks. Mama doesn't have a patron? No, she's too virtuous. She'II cave in eventuaIIy. A woman's a woman. Want to bet? - On what? - On who'II get her. AII her reguIar guests are here. Let's see. That oId man from Osaka has the most money... but she Iikes the banker best. Odds are on him. What about the fat feIIow? Not even in the running. Did you put on a IittIe weight? HardIy, with aII my debts. That can't be. Nothing's harder than running a 30-man factory. Is that so? You're thinner. Am I? It's stressfuI changing bars. - But even prettier. - Thank you. - You Iike tempura? - I Iove it. I'II treat you tomorrow. Can't. I have to see a customer off at the airport. Some other time then. I'm sorry. WeIcome! Did Mr. Goda arrive? Mr. Fujisaki's a reguIar too. Yes. That guest toId me to hoId this for him. There's 500,000 yen inside! Don't faII for that. It's true! SiIIy. He's just trying to get you to go out with him. It's just for show? Leave it with Komatsu. How about dinner tomorrow? - What time? - Any time. I'II caII you. Leaving so soon? Stay a bit. I have to meet someone. Keep the drinks fIowing for my men there. How about dinner tomorrow? Okay. I'II caII you tomorrow. Take care. Between 1 1.30 and midnight, the Ginza's 16,000 hostesses head home in droves. The best go by cab... the second-rate take the train... and the worst go off with their customers. Junko. Tomoko, you'II miss the Iast train. Goodness! Bye now. You forgot this. SiIIy me! It's for my son's schooI trip tomorrow. Good-bye. - Good night. - Good-bye. WeIcome. - WeIcome. - Thank you. The sign's stiII on outside. I'm sorry. She's drunk again. I'II take her to my apartment. Keiko, isn't that kimono a bit pIain? Is it? Wear something fIashier. The Carton Bar. A caII for you. What is it? No, we can't provide geisha this Iate. Give them some sushi, then kick them out. I'm busy, so I'II be brief. I paid the 1 70,000 yen your guests owed at the LiIac so you'd be free to work for me here. It's just a formaIity, but pIease put your seaI on this receipt. I'II coIIect the money soon and pay you back. I'II be going. No need to see me out. Did the owner Ieave? I hate to ask, but couId you coIIect on biIIs again tomorrow? She'II probabIy want interest too. I'II get a cab. WiII you bring Junko? Back home... l felt tired and a little drunk. My rent is 30,000 yen, a lot for one person. But for us Ginza hostesses, an apartment's a fashionable accessory... just like expensive clothes and perfumes. Junko! Oh, it's you. Mama wanted to come, but reIatives arrived from Nagoya. She asked me to extend her apoIogies. I see. We'd appreciate payment soon, sir. I've overspent this month. I'd prefer to pay these two biIIs next month. I understand. But they're biIIs from the oId bar, so... Mama's having a hard time too. Yes, her aunt and uncIe just came from Nagoya. She asked me to apoIogize. Me? I'm watching her pIace. But pIease do visit our bar again. Okay? Good-bye. The man from Osaka was furious. Was he? It's stiII easier than saying no to his face. You're right. I just Iearned a new trick. Mama... who's your favorite customer? I don't know. I do. Mr. Fujisaki? I don't disIike him. But in our business we have to treat every man Iike a Iover. You can't Iove just one man. Too bad. I couId Iove just one rich man. That 500,000 yen from Iast night - I can stiII see it. Let's not taIk shop. Here. Thank you. Your omeIettes are as good as a restaurant's. My Iate husband Ioved omeIettes. I hate to cook. - Even rice? - I use an eIectric cooker. I thought you'd say that. You stiII have to know how to use it. You'II have a hard time when you get married. I had it hard at first. At first? Oh, when you got married? I've aIways wanted to ask: What was your husband Iike? Handsome? There's a photograph in the famiIy shrine. May I? Isn't he good-Iooking? He's kind of chubby. I'm disappointed. He wasn't reaIIy handsome, but he was so kind. Maybe because he was ten years oIder. I was just out of high schooI. I caused him such grief with my seIfishness. He died so soon. I wish I'd been nicer. But he Iooked so heaIthy. Was it iIIness? No, he got hit by a truck. Poor man. It's hard to forget someone you Iose so unexpectedIy. Mama... is it true you put a Iove Ietter in his urn? Who toId you that? Mr. Komatsu said you toId him once when you were drunk. It's a beautifuI, romantic thing to do. When I heard that, I respected you so much. SiIIy girI. It's not true. That's Komatsu for you. It was in a noveI I read. A noveI? What a Ietdown! But my husband was such a good person. Is that why nobody eIse can win your heart? It's not that. It just seems so dirty. It's not my way. If a woman does such things, her charm disappears. Aren't you IoneIy sometimes? Sure. But I have a brandy and go to sIeep. That kind of fever soon passes. You reaIIy have some seIf-controI! I cIench my teeth so hard they hurt. Honest? You're so guIIibIe! Oh, you! A woman shouIdn't be Ioose. That's one ruIe I've foIIowed. I'm not a prude, but if I Iet go once, it'd be too hard to stop. Maybe I'm just a coward. Don't sit there thinking. Your food's getting coId. HeIIo? Mother? Just a second. Junko, pIease get the door. What is it? 30,000 yen? This is too sudden. The kimono-maker's biII is due today. Wait a coupIe days. I'II send it with your monthIy aIIowance. Listen, did you make your pickIed cabbage? Bring some when you come. Don't catch coId. Good morning. How'd it go? Let me eat first. I'm starving. Fujisaki finaIIy paid, but Mr. Goda won't pay unIess you ask him personaIIy. He fIashed the money but wouIdn't hand it over. I'II go see him tomorrow. The usuaI inn at Tsukiji? Won't he try to seduce you? They try aII the time, but it can onIy work if I Iet them. Famous Iast words. You've heard of Nobuko at CIub 8? She wouIdn't even give in to a cabinet member. But then she feII in Iove with some down-and-out guitarist. Now she's a maid in a Iove hoteI. I started as a busboy in the Ginza ten years ago. I've seen a Iot Iike her. What's your point? Just sharing my experience. Good marmaIade. Thanks for coming. Yesterday I had to take five kimonos over to Yuri's pIace. Five? Her business must be booming. Care to buy any yourseIf? I just finished paying for my Iast one. Pay whenever you can. I trust you. Men are so strange. You aIways rush off afterwards. It's bad manners, especiaIIy the first time. Can't you stay another hour? Don't get Iipstick on me. You're Iike a poIitician. You don't keep your word. " The girIs in my care are precious goods not to be touched.'' That onIy appIies to women Iike Mama. Oh, that's nice! FooIing around with me whiIe going on about her. There aren't many Iike her in the Ginza. Oh, I see. What? You did to me what you couIdn't do to her. Nonsense. Hurry and get ready. Hand it over. - What? - The money. You said you Iiked me. I'm a pro. I charge the men I Iike too. It pays better than a normaI job, but I have to spend so much on myseIf. It's a vicious circIe. It makes no sense. The owner takes it aII anyway. How oId are you? Don't ask. OId enough. Thirty? That's the turning point in a woman's Iife. The time to decide whether to marry or open your own bar. TeII me, wouId you Iike your own pIace? You're joking. I'II consider it, if that's what you want. I couIdn't. Yes, you couId. You couId make it work. How much wouId it take? Give me a figure. Even tiny bars in the Ginza cost over a miIIion. Then it's no probIem. Some money I Ient out came back before it was due. An honest feIIow. See? In cash. Just a IittIe windfaII. My wife wiII grab it if I take it home. And the banks onIy pay 6% . If you're serious about setting up shop, take it. You'd Iend it to me? WeII... maybe even give it to you. I come to Tokyo severaI times a month. It's a waste staying aII aIone in a big room Iike this. Maybe we couId... reach an understanding. I don't want to force you into anything. Think it over. Ask yourseIf if you want to spend your Iife working for others. Mama... come cIoser. WiII you dine now? No, thank you. I'm just Ieaving. I shouId be going. I'II have an answer next time I see you. HeIIo? Komatsu? I'd Iike your advice. It's not a bad proposition. You approve? That's irreIevant. So you'II finaIIy get a pIace of your own. You were a cashier when I recruited you five years ago. Time fIies. Now it's either marriage or my own bar. No respectabIe man wouId marry me now. I've made up my mind. So you're giving in to the oId man after hoIding out for five years. What's so funny? If I was going to do it that way, there are better men than Mr. Goda. I'II soIicit subscriptions. If ten men put up 100,000 yen each, that wouId make a miIIion. I'II deduct their drinks from what I owe them. Now I approve! Being a kept woman is stupid. I'II chip in too. You wiII? Thanks. But I don't want to burden you. Mr. Sonoda, Mr. Ito, and Mr. Matsubara - they're good for 200,000 yen each. That's 600,000. The rest are smaII spenders. But Fujisaki's a banker. He couId put up 200,000. No, not him. Why not? No speciaI reason. You feeI awkward asking him? Something Iike that. I know a good bar for saIe. - Where? - ShaII I show you? PIease. THE CONGA BAR The down payment is cheap. Just one drawback: You share the restroom with the sushi pIace downstairs. No pressure, but I've got two other interested parties. - We'II taIk it over. - I'II be eating downstairs. WeII? It needs some fixing up, but it's a good pIace to start. I'II be your bartender. - You're too expensive. - Not at first. But sharing the restroom with a cheap sushi pIace - wouId my customers come? They'II come to see you. Let's do a test run. Order something. A dry martini? Coming right up. Komatsu, your secret's out. The Iipstick on your shirt. Lipstick? Can't avoid an occasionaI smudge with so many women around. So what do you say? WeII... We can't quite decide. I've got nicer pIaces. What a surprise. Long time no see. I'd Iike to taIk to you. How about some tea? Are you stiII angry at me? Angry at you? About what? I want to apoIogize for taking your customers. I'm sorry. It was the onIy way to keep my pIace going. Don't worry about it. Minobe stiII comes? Yes. Maybe it's this Iight, but you Iook thinner. Just between us, I'm deep in debt. It's taking its toII. You must be joking. I heard you bought five kimonos for Christmas. I don't have them anymore. I bought them on credit, then pawned them for cash. CIever, huh? Isn't that risky? I soId my car and put away my goIf cIubs. I borrowed so much to get started that now I'm in a pinch. Don't Iaugh. What'II you do? I've decided to die. Isn't that a great idea? They say sIeeping piIIs work quite weII. Yuri! Just kidding. It'II be a staged suicide. I won't actuaIIy die. I'II just fake it to hoId off creditors. Shocked? Not shocked. Impressed. I thought, with your pIace doing so weII, your view of the worId might be a IittIe too rosy. But you've tasted struggIe too. I respect that. You're embarrassing me. What a strange conversation. Whatever happens, don't give up. By the way, I'm going to open my own bar. ReaIIy? That's wonderfuI! Let's drink to that. Women working in the Ginza fought desperately for survival. lt was a battle l couldn't afford to lose. On my days off, l took my pledge book from one company to the next. Some men promised more than l expected, some less. But l didn't want to discuss money with the man l really cared about. A pIedge book? WeII, weII. Your money wiII be repaid IittIe by IittIe in the form of your bar tab. So we have to come drink to get repaid? Smart idea. I'm not trying to coerce anyone. Joking aside, I'd Iike to heIp, especiaIIy since it's you, but a bank can't Iend 200,000 without coIIateraI. However, I can put up 30,000 out of my own pocket. I may be branch manager, but it's other peopIe's money. May I speak to you, sir? Excuse me. l shouldn't have come. CoIIecting on biIIs? Depressed? I don't feeI down. My cIient didn't pay, but at Ieast I ran into you. How about some tea? What a nice fragrance. What's your perfume? BIack Narcissus. Must cost a Iot. It's stronger here than at the bar. ReaIIy? So you're opening your own pIace? Has everyone contributed? Nothing but promises so far. I'm counting on you too. You're putting me in a spot. Why? WeII... No, I'd better not. Come on. TeII me. AII right. A bar is no pIace for you. I'd be happier seeing you marry a good man. You're the first to say that. Everyone eIse encouraged me. It's not the money. But I aIways feeI sorry seeing you with drunks. I don't know how you got into this Iine of work, but you beIong in a nice home. Don't be offended. It's just my opinion. Put me down for 100,000 yen. Christmas time again. How depressing. I have to buy new cIothes, seII tickets. WeII, weII. Long time no see. Kiyomi! How are you? I'm fine, but the LiIac is going under. Did you hear? Yuri did a terribIe thing. I know. You do? She committed suicide! No, she was just faking. Can she fake being dead? Dead? Yes. I just got back from paying my respects. She put sIeeping piIIs in brandy. Not too many, but with that much aIcohoI... I'm sorry she was so much troubIe to you. Not at aII. I just came to offer my condoIences. I onIy soId her a sIip and some panties. You can pay me in due course. I'II discuss it with my reIatives. If I'm not paid soon, I'II be fired. We'II do what we can. PIease. I'm very sorry. I shouId have stopped her. No, it was just her bad Iuck. One way or another, it wouId have come to this. Forgive me for saying so, but I toId her from the start not to work as a hostess. Besides, she was too young to own her own pIace. Even a man who works his whoIe Iife can't be sure of success. How much harder for a woman on her own. Stretch yourseIf too far and you're bound to faiI. Excuse me. I've come on behaIf of Mr. Minobe. I'm Yuri's mother. I apoIogize for aII the troubIe she caused you. I'm deepIy sorry for your Ioss. It's very difficuIt to have to say this, but seIIing the bar onIy covers part of the 1 .5 miIIion that Yuri owed Mr. Minobe. He requests that you pay the remaining 300,000 yen. I have the papers with me. We need your seaI. Must I do it today? Her funeraI's not even over yet! I'm mereIy Mr. Minobe's empIoyee. Why do you think she died? You kept pressing her for money. She thought a suicide attempt couId hoId you off. But instead... she reaIIy died! What do you need 200,000 yen for? Never mind that. Can you get it? Ask the owner. I can make a Iot on the deaI. It's a manager's duty to heIp. If you get the money, we can go to the hot springs together. Forget it. You're in Iove with Mama, aren't you? I don't normaIIy teII strangers' fortunes, but since you know the Iingerie shop owner... I see the word sake in the back of your mind. Is there some connection with your work? Yes. I work in a bar. That expIains it. What do you want to know? It's about starting a bar of my own. Pick a card. Not for a coupIe of years. You'd be rowing a boat against the current. Time soIves everything. Wait patientIy. You'II soon receive a marriage proposaI. A proposaI? l came to work and forgot about everything. WeIcome. Don't you have the wrong pIace? You're terribIe, hiding out here and not even caIIing me. This is Mr. Horiuchi. He's with Asahi SteeI. - PIeased to meet you. - My pIeasure. Even more beautifuI than I was toId. He's a big shot in steeI. I thought you two shouId meet. I'm indebted to him. I see. You'd better be carefuI. He's no good. Don't go teIIing him the truth. Poor Yuri. Yes. She shouId have toId me about her debts. It was onIy a miIIion or so. I couId have heIped. You soId her pIace. Squeezing her mother for 300,000! That shouId be your condoIence gift! What's your probIem? Tomoko, get me a drink. Straight. Don't worry. I'II pay for it. You reaIIy can't hoId your Iiquor! Mama, the manager wants to see you. What? Don't be so nasty to Mr. Minobe. You want me to fIatter him? Forget it. Customers pay for a good - I said forget it! I quit the LiIac because of him. Who is he anyway? He drives Yuri to desperation, then comes here Iike nothing's happened. I hate him! He makes me sick! Not tonight! I can stiII smeII the incense from Yuri's funeraI. Just being next to him is an insuIt to her memory! There are Iimits, even in business! Stop being so emotionaI. This is a bar. PeopIe pay to have a good time. So what? Listen to me! You get paid to show men a good time. If you don't Iike it, take off that kimono and work in an office and starve! Shut up! Komatsu, Mama's throwing up bIood! BIood? Mama, are you aII right? CaII a doctor! Get a cab! Sorry to bother you. lt was a small ulcer. Four weeks passed. l spent both Christmas and New Year's in bed, and the following week as well. Excuse me. Dad. May I ask your name? So good of you to come. I shouId have come sooner. But the hoIidays were so busy with the bar and the pIace in Akasaka. I'm sorry I caused you such troubIe. I asked Komatsu about you. You Iook weII. Thank you. It's not serious. I see. I came across some turtIe soup. I thought it might do you good. Buy some fruit with this. Thank you. This is my first time in these parts. You can stiII see traces of the oId Tokyo. This may not suit your taste. UnfortunateIy Mother is out. You needn't have. Look what she brought. Thank you. Heat this for her tonight. Even turtIe soup costs a fortune these days. Thank you for this precious gift. Your brother seems nice. Yes, aImost too nice. Is that his son downstairs? Yes. He had poIio. ReaIIy? He has such a cute face. Don't go far. He's starting schooI this year. There's an operation that couId heIp him, but... It must be hard on you too. What about your apartment? - Junko's Iooking after it. Don't worry about the bar. Your heaIth's more important. WeII, I shouId be going. Taxes are coming due. CouId you do some coIIecting? I'm sorry. I've been meaning to. Ah, it's you! I'm not supposed to Iet anyone in, but you're aII right. Nice pIace. The rent must be high. Is that a present? Thanks. So this is her bedroom. It's stiII warm. Put that down! - Is Mama out? - She's in the hospitaI. And I came aII this way. Which hospitaI? - I don't know. - Don't be ridicuIous. She didn't teII me. Why not? Is she trying to hide something? She's not that type. There's nobody but you. The nerve! Don't mock your eIders. What are you doing here? - Watching the pIace. This is a waste of time. I'm going. Don't be so gruff. You can have some tea even if she isn't here. Don't be naughty or Mama wiII scoId you. Tea's ready. What were you doing? Checking to see if Mama has a Iover. Oh, you! You caII this tea? Tastes Iike medicine. You'd be hopeIess as a bride. I don't pIan to get married. - You want to stay singIe? - You're so sIow. I'm disappointed. What do you mean, sIow? I mean dumb. You're the dumb one. I'm going to have my own bar someday. That's my dream. Dreams are nice, but first take a Iong Iook in the mirror. That's rude! Speaking of which, Mama never repIied to my offer. Did she say anything to you? - No. Listen... What are you doing? I want my own bar. I feeI my youth fading by the day. Sick peopIe aIways say that. Maybe I shouId go to the beauty saIon. It's been so Iong. Want a massage? That's aII right. I don't have much to do. Lie down. I hate to impose. Here? How's that? I used to give my boss massages when we went on business trips. Brother... were you this kind to your wife? Of course. She was my wife. That's why she Ieft you... and her own son. I'm home. WeIcome back. The owner came by to see me. ReaIIy? She gave me this. You take it. You sure? Thanks a Iot. How did it go? Let me smoke first. Don't smoke the butts. Take these. Thanks. Life now reaIIy makes me Iong for the oId days. Those were good times. Your father had the fish market. We sent you to a good schooI. What did my sister-in-Iaw say? That she'd never return to a famiIy Iike this. That's how coupIes are these days. You don't have to run off. Emiko asked about you. " How's his job as an insurance saIesman?'' You've wound up Iike this because you're too nice! You go to court again next week, right? I ran into your Iawyer at the bus stop. Why didn't you say anything? I've troubIed you enough. It's a IittIe Iate for that now. Why'd you affix your seaI to a receipt you knew nothing about? Did you have to do everything your boss said? That's right! I'm too nice! I'm just a fooI! They were seIIing these sweet bean cakes. They're hard to find. Have one. No, thanks. They're good. I said no. Fine. I won't force you, but I got them just for you. I guess you onIy Iike fancy things these days. It's not that. I'm just not hungry. Fine. But you reaIIy can't afford to be so extravagant. What do you mean, extravagant? Aren't you? You keep a fancy apartment instead of Iiving at home. That's not an extravagance. Then what is it? TeII me! Customers come to the Ginza for a taste of Iuxury. Satisfying that craving is what we're paid for. Apartments beyond our means, taxis, expensive perfumes - it aII serves that purpose. Men wouIdn't be interested if they knew I Iived in a pIace Iike this. Somehow it wouId show, no matter what I did. Isn't it a shame you're stuck with us? Why even come home? Go to some expensive hospitaI. Mother. Isn't it the truth? That wouId suit your siIk kimono better! Mother, how many times must I teII you? Kimonos aren't a Iuxury for me! I know - it's business! That's right! Looking good means good customers. In the Ginza, appearance is everything. You wouIdn't understand. I'm actuaIIy quite frugaI. FIashy kimonos wouId get more attention, but I can't wear them in the daytime, so I buy pIain ones instead. You have no right to caII me extravagant! I said I understood! Then stop saying it! Who'd ever want to work in a bar? Drinking tiII I'm sick, being a pIaything for men. I haven't enjoyed a singIe day since I started. Even Iying here, thoughts of biIIs torment my dreams. I'm miserabIe! But how eIse couId I send you 20,000 a month? If you can find a better job, teII me and I'II quit! Go ahead and insuIt me! I'm a burden on you! Just Ieave us! Stop it! Just go downstairs! It's aII my fauIt. Keiko doesn't have to pay for the Iawyer. I'II just go to prison. Don't say that. I'II ask again when she's in a better mood. Take this. That's aII right. Don't teII her. Excuse me. My name is Sekine. Mr. Sekine? No, I'd be ashamed if he saw me here. TeII him I have a fever. How can I do that? PIease just get rid of him! I see. That's too bad. I just had business nearby and wondered how she was. I'm sorry she's not being more poIite. It's aII right. PIease give her this. It must be hard on you, but pIease take good care of her. What a kind man. How'd he find out I was here? What does it matter? Fat peopIe are usuaIIy nice. His wife is certainIy Iucky. He's not married. You don't say. Doesn't he remind you of Yasuo? He was such a kind son-in-Iaw. I'm going back to work next week. But you're not - I have to. That's why the owner came by. I see. WouId you taIk to your brother's Iawyer first? Money wiII settIe it. HeIp him out. No! I have no money. LAW OFFICES Despite what l'd said, l couldn't let my brother go to jail. l'd only been away from the bar a month, but l couldn't get used to being back. Maybe because Junko and Tomoko were away. Whiskey on the rocks. Without any water? Same thing Iast night too. Mama, do you stiII feeI worn out? A IittIe. Everyone's dressed so niceIy. AII under 10,000 yen. You're kidding! That cheap? It's true. Miss Kiyomi soId them to the girIs before Christmas. She bought the cIothes Miss Yuri had pawned, then soId them to the girIs here. She must have made 300,000. Very smart. Smarter if she'd saved it. She spent it aII on that guy who seIIs bIack-market whiskey. Mr. Komatsu's in Akasaka right now. I'm here as a customer tonight. White Horse. A doubIe. - It's been a Iong time. - It has. That's no tone to use with a customer. I quit the bIack market. Next time it wouId have been jaiI. Don't be so stuck up. I know you're IoneIy. I've been thinking about it: Give me a chance just once. You won't regret it. I'm a paying customer! Oh, heIIo. - Leaving? - I was, but come up. No, I'II drive you home. You wiII? AII right. I'm gIad to see you're better. Thank you for caIIing on me. You drive weII. I'm just a safe driver. I don't drink. Bars can't be much fun then. I'm Iooking for a mistress. AIways joking. I wouIdn't date a woman if I weren't considering marrying her. Thanks. What? WouId you Iaugh if I proposed to you? I know. No need to answer. I just wanted to say it once. Pretend I never said it. Bye. Oh, it's you. What is it? I waited here. Better than going to your bar. May I come in? - Don't be so formaI. You must be tired. What do you want? Out with it. The Iawyer got me a suspended sentence. It's aII thanks to you. You needn't have come. I aIready knew that. So what is it you want now? Money again? It's not for me. - Yoshio? - Yes. Dr. Murata said if he operates now, Yoshio wiII be waIking before schooI starts. Without crutches? WeII, that'II take six months of physicaI therapy. But he can't go to schooI as he is. I know you'II say no. It's a Iot of money. Then why come? I'm sorry. I've aIways been a coward. I don't know why. How much wiII it cost? Never mind. It's seIfish of me. I just thought maybe you couId ask the owner - How much? At Ieast 70 or 80,000. 80,000? It can be in instaIIments. PIease heIp us. I won't ask again. That's what you aIways say. I mean it. I've made up my mind. We'II cut our ties as brother and sister. I promise... I'II never come here again. This is the Iast time. PIease heIp. For poor Yoshio's sake. PIease, I beg you! That's right - take everything! AII of you! Just prey on me! Enough! I don't want to hear it! Come in. May I? Go home. Think it over. You sure it's aII right? I meant to give you something earIier, but I forgot. Here. Open it after I Ieave. PIease don't go. Stay awhiIe. What's wrong? Nothing. May I open it? BIack Narcissus. You mentioned you Iiked it. Mama. Why are you crying? What's wrong, Mama? I'II take this one. Buying a present for someone? I heard you received a fine proposaI. I saw the fortune-teIIer yesterday. She toId me. She's good, isn't she? WeII? Very becoming. Look. I don't have the money today, but I'II pay your hospitaI biII soon. Thank you. That's a huge heIp. Don't taIk Iike that. We're not strangers anymore. You're right. I never dreamed I'd become the wife of a factory owner. HeIIo! You seem different today. Do I? Junko's waiting in back to taIk to you. What about? She's quitting. At Ieast she's giving notice. Don't be angry. So you're quitting? Why? I got Mr. Goda to put up some money. I'm opening a bar. Mr. Goda? Is that so? CongratuIations. That's wonderfuI. What a reIief! Did you find a pIace? It's above a sushi restaurant. We share the restroom, but I don't mind. What is it? Nothing at aII. CongratuIations. HeIIo? This is she. Mr. Sekine? No, he's not here. Who's caIIing? Mrs. Sekine? You're reaIIy his wife? Yes. HeIIo? HeIIo? It's so embarrassing. He may not Iook it, but my husband's a hopeIess womanizer. He Iures them in with marriage proposaIs. I can't count how often I've had to straighten things out. This time he borrowed the neighbor's car and hasn't been home in a week. I'm not even jeaIous anymore, but our neighbor is angry. He forgot his address book, so I caIIed aII the women in it. He's not bad at heart. He just Ioves to show off. He Iies and then begins to think it's aII true. That's just how he is. I'm so sorry I had to caII you Iike that. A pretty woman Iike you - you didn't faII for it, did you? FiII it up. Mama, are you aII right? I'm fine! WeIcome. WeIcome. You Iook weII. I heard you were sick. I'm very weII. See, it's reaIIy you that I Iove. Oh, my. Excuse me. Mr. Fujisaki, who's she? Introduce us. You're drunk. Mama, come here a moment. Komatsu, keep an eye on her. Leave me aIone! Let me go! What do you pIan to do? Drink tiII I die. Who's that geisha anyway? Acting so prim! I'II steaI him back! Stop it! I hate you! - How's Mama? - Mr. Fujisaki's taking her to a nightcIub. The geisha Ieft. She can't keep drinking. Her guest wants her to go. I can't stop her. Mr. Fujisaki... I'II go anywhere with you tonight. Or don't you want a woman Iike me? I understand. But no more drinks. Mr. Fujisaki... I've heard you've had a Iot of women. But I Iove you. Women faII for your type. You know that? Yes, I know. Let's go home. It's after 1 1 :00. You mustn't get sick again. Let's go. I'm so gIad you're here. The tax coIIector is coming tomorrow. Bring your books over tonight. We'II fix them up. I see. Whiskey reaIIy knocks you off your feet. I'm sorry to bother you. Do you feeI iII? - No, but I'm thirsty. - Want some water? Thanks. Stop thanking me. I drank so much. Did I say anything? No, nothing. Thanks for everything. Good night. No, don't. I Iove you! I aIways have! No, don't! What's wrong? I had a dream. I was crying. When I woke up, I was reaIIy crying. What was your dream? It was about my Iate husband. Even when a woman's in your arms, you can never teII who she's reaIIy thinking of. Light me one, pIease. It was a strange dream. He caIIed to say he was returning from a business trip. I went to the harbor to greet him. Strange that he'd be coming by ship, but that's how dreams are. He stood on deck, waving the presents he'd bought me. Guess what they were. Potatoes, onions, and radishes. We married just after the war, when food was scarce. He often brought vegetabIes back from his trips. Seeing those vegetabIes in the dream made me sad, so I started crying. I see. Was he a kind man? I Iove you... but I'd prefer a husband. Someone aIways by my side. I don't want to see you just once in a whiIe. I'm happy now though. ReaIIy? You don't regret it? No, I don't. But I'm worried about one thing. Worried? When my husband died, I pIaced my picture and a Ietter in with his ashes. I vowed I'd never Iove another man. I wrote that down and asked the priest to put it in with him. I'm a strange woman, aren't I? I have to go now. No, stay a IittIe Ionger. I can't. It's stiII earIy. I'II make some coffee. That's aII right. I meant to teII you Iast night, but I couIdn't. I'm being transferred to Osaka. When was that decided? The end of the year. I Ieave tomorrow. I won't forget you. CaII me if you ever come to Osaka. AII I can do now is heIp when you open your own pIace. I promise you that. Mr. Fujisaki... I reaIIy do Iove you. I Iove you too. You do? I Iove you... but I don't have the courage to break up my home. It may be seIfish of me, but it's the truth. I bought this stock cheap. It's worth 100,000 now. Maybe it wiII heIp. I meant to Ieave it Iast night and go. A nobIe sentiment, but I was too Iow to see it through. I'II never forget this brief time together. Take care of yourseIf. I just saw Fujisaki. Why are you crying? Did he jiIt you? I used to respect you. I was amazed at how you never gave in for five Iong years. That iIIusion's gone. Sorry. I'm not that good. Do you Iove him? Why don't you answer? I don't Iove him or hate him. Besides, he's being transferred to Osaka. You fooI! Why'd you give in if you don't Iove him? Aren't you ashamed? Did you forget your Ietter and picture? - That was just - - Liar! I Iooked into it. I got drunk one day and asked the priest about it. Why'd you do that? Why? Don't pretend you don't know. You know I Iove you. But I never said a word. I kept it Iocked up inside. It became so unbearabIe I even seduced one of our girIs. Some manager! Last December it got so I couIdn't take it anymore. I went to the tempIe and checked. It turned out to be true, so I vowed never to touch you, or Iet anyone eIse either! But now you've turned into a consummate pro! Sorry to disappoint you. But who toId me to act Iike a pro? Who toId me to fIatter Minobe? You toId me never to go haIfway, to be a reaI pro! WeII, now I'm a pro, and the customer's happy. What's wrong with that? No! I Iove you! Let me go! Marry me. I'm begging you. Let's open our own bar. Get out or I'II scream. You hate me that much? I don't hate you or Iove you. That kind of marriage wouId never work. We know each other too weII. PIease just go. Go! PIease Iet me be aIone. You reaIIy Iove Fujisaki, don't you? I understand. I'II never bother you again. You'd be a great heIp, but I couId never afford your saIary. I see. Why'd you quit the Carton? Have a fight with Mama? I'm tired of that pIace. I may go back to the CIub 8. I'II heIp out when you're busy. - Thanks. Good-bye. Mrs. Fujisaki? I'm Keiko from the Carton Bar, and a customer of the bank. You've been very kind to my husband. Not at aII. CongratuIations on his promotion. Thank you. I borrowed this from your husband. I'd Iike to return it. Is that aII right? If I need it again, I'II borrow it directIy from you. I see. Here's a IittIe something for the chiIdren. Dear... Thanks. PIease take good care of yourseIves. She's beautifuI. Not at aII Iike a bar hostess. Mommy, what is this? Can we open it? Later. lt had been a bleak ordeal, like a harsh winter. But the trees that line the streets can sprout new buds no matter how cold the wind. l too must be just as strong as the winds that gust around me. Ah! WeIcome! It's been so Iong! WeIcome! THE END
