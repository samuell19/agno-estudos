[elevator whirring] [elevator dings] [wind whistling] BEAST'S EX: Once, many winters ago... there lived a handsome prince... who had everything he ever wanted... except for one thing. Me. Every day he carted me with a new gift, and every day I turned him down... until one day he brought something that I could not resist. From the far reaches of the northern fjords... a magic rose whose battles could stop death in its tracks. Promising to love each other forever, we each took a petal. Years passed... and soon his attention drifted to another. So, I cursed him and his lover... to be prisoners unto themselves... which is why he is a prince no longer. [indistinct voices whispering] BEAST'S EX: Now, he is a beast. -[beast growls] -[man yells] BEAST'S EX: He has become a thing of legend to the villagers that he once ruled. It wasn't enough for him to live alone in peace. He's cursed... to guard the rose forever... unless... [wind whistling] [fire crackling] [pensive music playing] [♪♪♪] [water dripping] [Beast growls] Snorri, let's go. [unsettling music playing] [♪♪♪] [air whooshes] -[Snorri yelling] -[Beast growling] -[flesh ripping] -[yelling continues] [ominous music playing] -[soft music playing] -[singer vocalizing] PAPA: Belle! PAPA: Belle! Belle! Belle, I need you! [birds chirping] -[soft music playing] -[singer vocalizing] SVENNI: No, you need to convince her. -SVENNI: Yeah, I hope-- -What's happened? Nothing has happened, Belle. Come. Sit with us. [Papa's throat clears] PAPA: Have a drink. [chuckles] PAPA: I wanna propose a toast. Let's toast to Svenni's new barn. Yeah. -PAPA: Yeah? -To Svenni's new barn. PAPA: Yes! Skol. -PAPA: Skol. -SVENNI: Skol. [Papa coughing] Skol. You look tired. No, I'm not tired. No. Listen, could you go get us some butter? [chuckles] [soft music playing] [sighs] [gasps] Oh, Svenni, you scared me. I'm sorry. -Did you want another drink? -No, thank you, Belle. I'm not drinking this night. Oh. Belle, you are the most beautiful girl I... What I mean to say is, Belle, will you be my wife? Svenni... I'm not going to marry you. I've got your Papa's permission. What does that have anything to do with it? -I only meant-- -You were there when I was born. Yes, it was meant to be. Oh... [sighs] I have such fondness for you, Svenni. Just not in this way. Ever in this way. So? -[door opens] -[man gasping] [pensive music playing] Where is Snorri? -[unsettling music playing] -[indistinct voices whispering] [log thuds] [Papa coughing] [birds chirping] -[log thuds] -[Papa groans] [coughs, clears throat] -[ax thuds] -BELLE: Hey? -[thuds] -BELLE: Hey, hey, hey, hey. PAPA: It's okay. It is fine, it's fine. It's fine, just... [Papa coughing] [high pitched ringing] BELLE: Are you okay? Hey? It's nothing, I'm fine. Just... I'm fine. Come on. Come on, we're going inside. -[Papa coughing] -[pensive music playing] [coughing continues] Jeez! [groans] Go lie down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [coughs] -[water splashing] -Ow! [breathes heavily] [Belle grunts] [water splashing] [♪♪♪] -What took you so long? -I need to fix the leak. The roof not stable. You could hurt yourself. I slipped and almost broke my neck. You have to remember to empty the bucket. Wouldn't need one if you let me fix the leak. [sighs] Eat your soup. [sighs] Finish your work. [pensive music playing] -[birds chirping] -[Belle panting] [Belle grunts] No! No, no, no! [grunts] [screams] [gasping] PAPA: Belle! Belle! [grunts] [soft music playing] [singer vocalizing] [♪♪♪] Are you ready? [horse snorts] Good. -[soft music playing] -[singer vocalizing] [♪♪♪] -[unsettling music playing] -[wind whistling] [branches snapping] -[crow cawing] -[creatures calling] [Belle panting] [air whooshing] [Belle gasps] [air whooshing] Come on. [Belle thuds, grunts] [music intensifies] -[music stops] -[Belle gasping] -[horse panting] -[wind whistling] [panting] -[eerie music playing] -[seagulls squawking] [water splashing] [waves crashing] [indistinct voices whispering] If I'm not back before dark, find your own way home. [soft music playing] [singer vocalizing] [fire crackling] Hello? [vocalizing continues] [♪♪♪] Thank you. [pensive music playing] [♪♪♪] [water dripping] [Belle panting] [fire whooshes] [music intensifies] [Beast growling] Hello? [fire whooshing] -[unsettling music playing] -[water dripping] [Beast growling] I've come to ask for your rose. [Beast growling] -[pensive music playing] -[singer vocalizing] Please. [Beast growling] My Papa has fallen ill... and I was told that your rose could cure him. [Beast growling] I am Belle. And you are? [Beast growling] This place isn't so bad. It's peaceful. I imagine here one has time to be alone with their thoughts. -BELLE: Alone? -[eerie music playing] Yes. Alone. It must be nice. I've always wanted to find a place like this to be alone. [unsettling music playing] -[pants] -[Beast growling] [singer vocalizing] -[breathes heavily] -[growling continues] [♪♪♪] [music fades] [wind whistling] [gasps] Ow! [soft intriguing music playing] For your papa. Thank... [clears throat] Thank you. [fire crackling] [latch creaking] Show me Belle. [magical chiming] Thank you for waiting. Let's go home now. -[magical chiming] -[unsettling music playing] -[soft music playing] -[singer vocalizing] [water splashing] You want to stay here all day, don't you? [horse pants] BELLE: I can't let you do that. We need to save Papa. [horse pants] -[soft music playing] -[singer vocalizing] [birds chirping] [pensive music playing] BELLE: Will it do? It will do. Okay. Now what? Hm. [water bubbling] [smoke whooshing] [spoon clinking] That's it? BEAST'S EX: Don't worry. You have already done all the work. [Papa coughing] [liquid sloshing] -[Papa coughs] -BELLE: How do you feel? I feel... I... I... I feel... [gong clangs] Wow! -My girl... [laughs] -[Belle laughs] You've brought me back from death! We are not finished. We're not? The spell has an unless. An unless? You were gravely ill. I have enchanted you to be otherwise, but it's only that, an enchantment, so it will not last. How long will it last? Until sunrise. Unless what? Drop of blood on the petal of the Beast's rose revived you for the night. But if Belle were to fully sacrifice herself-- I would never! Give up your freedom to the Beast, and you could be strong forever. Sit down and be quiet! I need to think. [unsettling music playing] [♪♪♪] She's bluffing. [gasps mockingly] Am I? You have your health back. Enjoy this night, and the many more ahead of you. Thank you for your help. [sighs] -[birds chirping] -[chickens clucking] [pensive music playing] Papa? [groans] Belle... Just let me die. I met the Beast. He was gentle. I could stay with him. No. [music intensifies] [birds chirping] [wind whistling] [singer vocalizing] You can't come with me this time. [horse panting] [soft music playing] [instinct voices whispering] [♪♪♪] Hello again. Don't you ever get tired holding this all day and night? I know you're not a big talker, but maybe sometime you can tell me how the beast became-- [Beast growling] MAN 1: No, no, no! [wailing] [Beast growling] [man 1 wailing] -[brick thuds] -[blood splattering] [flesh squelching] [growls] -[eerie music playing] -[gasps] [growls] [panting] [breathes heavily] [scraping echoes] -[eerie music playing] -[water dripping] So, the legend is true. [pensive music playing] That's the spell. Spell? A spell is the reason I have to stay here. My Papa will die if I leave. So, you will choose your Papa over your own safety? Your spell... does it also have an unless? [waves splashing] [fire whooshing] -[water dripping] -[wind whistling] BELLE: Thank you. Do you have anything to eat? I mean, what people eat? No. Well... I'm hungry. [soft music playing] [♪♪♪] [bugs chirping] [Beast inhales] The stem is poisonous, but you can eat the leaves. [Beast inhales] BELLE: Your spell, it must have rules too. An unless? What is it? I asked you before, but you didn't answer. I can't help you if you don't tell me. I have to fall in love. Oh. [Belle's throat clears] [♪♪♪] [water splashing] Would you like to try some? [eerie music playing] [Beast coughing] It's not that bad. [choking, coughing] You can't eat anything that's not... [groans] If we could figure out the rules of your spell then maybe... [groans] I'm going to figure it out. [bright music playing] BELLE: Okay, ready? [♪♪♪] -[grunts] -[rocks thuds] [spits] Anything? [pensive music playing] [intriguing music playing] BELLE: Ready? Do it! [water splashing] [panting] Well... at least you're cleaner. [sighs] [intriguing music playing] [♪♪♪] Try moving. [groans] Good. [pensive music playing] [yells] BEAST: Enough! [groans] Stop it! [grunts] [gentle music playing] [blows] [singer vocalizing] [water splashing] It's as important to figure out the things that do not cause you to change... so I consider today a huge success. [growling] No! [ominous music playing] [pants] [blows] [panting] [Beast growling] -[grunts] -[growls] [yells] [dramatic music playing] [yells] [breathes heavily] -[laughs] -[stick thuds] [yells] -[Beast grunting] -[pensive music playing] [Beast yells] -[pants] -[singer vocalizing] Show me Belle. -[magical chiming] -[soft music playing] [rock scraping] It's over. -For now. -Leave me alone. Please, take this. I don't want it. Anything you wish to see... tell the mirror. You must miss your Papa. -[water dripping] -[wind whistling] I'm sorry. Show me Papa. -[magical chiming] -[soft music playing] I failed you. I lost our daughter. [sullen music playing] [♪♪♪] It must be so peaceful there, the quiet ground. I'm going to make things right. I love you, Papa. -[soft music playing] -[wind whistling] -[rock thuds] -[water splashes] -[water gurgling] -[eerie music playing] [slurps] BELLE: Could you love me? Falling in love is the only way to break your curse. Yes. -[water dripping] -[wind whistling] [water splashing] Can't be that hard. Come on. I must have won quality that you could love. For example, I think... your eyes are kind. [water splashing] You smell good. I do? See? [rocks clattering] [pensive music playing] [gasps] -[grunts] -BEAST: Hey! [Belle yells] Svenni! [men gasping] Stop it! -Papa! -[Beast grunts] BELLE: Let him go! He's not going to hurt anyone. He ate my cousin Snorri! And after Snorri went missing, his sons went to find him, and he ate them as well. All six of them! -All six! -All six of Snorri sons! Belle, why do you defend this monster? Because I believe deep down he is a good man. -Move aside, Belle. -I will not. -We're going home. -No! No! No, no! No! [rock scraping] -BELLE: Stop or you will die! -A small price to pay. I have a plan. You don't have to do this. -You're not thinking straight. -BELLE: I'm upside down. -I am not a child. -Then stop behaving like one. Everything I do is for you. Well, that's not the way it's supposed to be. That's my job. I feel this... this is right for me right now. And what, Belle? What are you doing? What is your plan? I don't know, but at least it's mine and not Svenni. -Don't bring Svenni into this. -I didn't. You did. So, you'd rather be the Beast's prisoner? I choose to stay here. You are kidnapping me. I am your father. [pensive music playing] Skuggi... Svenni... time to go! Svenni, Skuggi! [♪♪♪] This is where you want to be? Then I've failed. [sullen music playing] [♪♪♪] [Beast grunting] What is wrong with me? You're fine. I'm not fine. I think you're fine. Are you going to bury them? I can, yes. I can take them to the forest where you won't smell them. I knew these men. They deserve to be buried. I will cover them tonight and bury them tomorrow. Where are we going to sleep? I can't... I can't sleep here. If you leave my side, your papa will die. I can't be here. [unsettling music playing] [♪♪♪] -[crickets chirping] -[fire crackling] BELLE: How many people have you... The ghosts... are with me everywhere. -[fire whooshes] -[gasps] [crickets chirping] Where are you going? In case... How will I know? Sing. Sing for me... so then I'll know you're there... and then... when the singing stops... I do not sing. Then I will not sleep. [sings in Icelandic] Do you... have another one? No. [sighs] [sings in Icelandic] [pensive music playing] -[Beast breathing heavily] -[heartbeat pounding] [sings in Icelandic] [birds chirping] [Belle knocking] [door creaking] Don't suppose you have any money? Goods to trade? And your husband... [sighs] He's not... had the bath in some time sometime, but he is strong, as am I. We will work if you give us food and board for the night. [door slams] Lemon! FREYJA: Go away! Lemon! FREYJA: Saying lemon isn't gonna make me open the door. I noticed your flowers. Squeeze lemon juice into the water. It will bring them back. -[door creaking] -[soft music playing] My mother taught me. Just a little bit. I can do it if you want. It's not much, but it's clean. Take some time to wash up, and when you're done I could use your help shucking the corn, and you can help my husband in the kitchen when you've washed up. Thank you again. Yeah. All right. [sighs] [door closes] [birds chirping] Um... [clears throat] -I'm just gonna-- -Yeah. [soft music playing] [water splashing] [♪♪♪] [children laughing] BELLE: What are we doing? What do you mean? What are we doing? What is our plan? We don't have a plan. I don't understand. Nevermind. I'll just go downstairs. I suppose she needs help shucking the bed. -What? -Shucking the corn. Yes. So, I'll just... [gentle music playing] [birds chirping] [Beast sniffing] The nice man in the kitchen needs your help with... the potatoes. I'll just see you at dinner. [door closes] [gentle music playing] [water splashing] [exhales] -[lemon juice splashing] -[soft music playing] [group chattering] [speaks indistinctly] Here. I want them peeled and not a piece of skin on them. Hm? Yeah. Good. And then we salt them. Yeah? You and your wife fighting? Okay, okay. I could feel the tension. She's holding out on you? Oh, okay, okay, friend, okay. Let me tell you one thing. It will save your marriage. They are always right. No, really, always. They're always right, huh? Even when you don't think they are right, they probably still are, ah. And when they are actually wrong... They are still right? Yeah. Remember that. I guarantee it. No more problems. Now, salt it. [potatoes rustling] Did you have a plan? A plan? Your husband seems like a nice man. How long have you been married? Thirty years. So, you planned that? Or maybe you got married first and then you made a plan? Ah. You found out he's not perfect. Well... there's this one thing he does. FREYJA: Only one thing? [laughs] I hope it stays that way. Well, I don't. What, does he hurt you? He doesn't. No. I feel like I don't have any purpose. You don't. [soft music playing] [♪♪♪] -It's nice to have visitors. -Yeah. -FREYJA: Yes. -Yeah. -Our son just moved away. -Oh. -He's going to be a priest. -FREYJA: Yes, he is. We were really lucky that he got that opportunity. Mm hm. He lost his fingers, except those two here. It doesn't matter. You can pray even though you only have... like this. He was a very difficult child. He was, that's why he's so lucky. He's always been very clumsy. Clumsy boy. -FREYJA: Yeah. -Mm. -ODR: You could say that. -Yeah. He just blind. -Yeah, but we didn't know. -Oh. -No. -ODR: No. We didn't know until -he was six years old. -Yes. FREYJA: He was just always running into things. I had difficulties teaching him to read. He almost killed his father one time. [chuckles] -ODR: Yeah. -Oh. FREYJA: Odr was picking up potatoes. ODR: Yeah. He comes running with the pitchfork -straight into his ass cheeks. -ODR: Yeah. You wanna see? Yeah. -ODR: I survived. -Yeah, he survived. -Yeah. [chuckles] Skol. -Skol. [chuckles] -Okay. -[glasses clinking] Skol. Have some more bread? Yeah, yeah. Mm. Hm. You missed a spot. Come in the kitchen. [gentle music playing] [soft music playing] There. Come on. [music intensifies] [♪♪♪] [water splashing] [water swishing] [Belle spits] [crickets chirping] I was just getting ready for bed. BEAST: Okay. BELLE: Because... I'm going to sleep now. BEAST: Yes. [Belle's throat clears] BELLE: And you... where are you going to sleep? BEAST: Here. BELLE: Oh. Mm-hm. That's a good idea. [sighs] Goodnight. Yes, it was. BELLE: That's not what you say. When someone says goodnight, you don't say, "Yes, it was." You just say goodnight. Sorry. You're right. Don't say you're sorry, just say goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. [crickets chirping] [soft music playing] [♪♪♪] [pensive music playing] [♪♪♪] [Belle inhales] I figured it out. [pensive music playing] [♪♪♪] -[flesh squelching] -[Beast grunting] [Beast growls] [eerie music playing] [Belle vomits] [Belle gasping] BEAST: Belle? [eerie music playing] BEAST: Your papa. It's sleep. It happens when you sleep. I am so sorry. It's no way to live. [soft music playing] [sobs softly] [screams] -[gentle music playing] -[body dragging] [Beast grunting] [eerie music playing] -[soft music playing] -[water splashing] [mud squelching] [singer vocalizing] -[soft music playing] -[singer vocalizing] [Papa groans] Hi. It was funny. I was outside planting a tree and suddenly my strength-- [Papa coughs] [unsettling music playing] [Papa groans] Did he hurt you? No. [eerie music playing] [♪♪♪] -[rock thuds] -[yells] -[air whooshing] -[vocalizing fades] [soft music playing] [water dripping] Show me Belle. -[magical chiming] -[eerie music playing] Papa is dead. Is that the rose? Surely something can be done with it? Yes. [sighs] Many things can be done. He continues to hurt innocent people... because he's under a spell. Please, help me use the rose to break his spell. I can't take this anymore. He's changed! He deserves a chance. Do you know how powerful this rose is? And yet, you still wanna use it on a man, violent, selfish man. -It's not just him. It's-- You are such... [indistinct] [gasping] He'll touch you first. Praise. [neck breaks] -[Belle thuds] -[dramatic music playing] [pensive music playing] [Belle's mom speaking in Icelandic] [thunder rumbling] [♪♪♪] [thunder rumbling] There he was. -[grunts] -[gasping] BEAST'S EX: No! [gasping] [solemn music playing] [♪♪♪] BEAST'S EX: I no longer saw a beast. He changed. Just not for me. [pensive music playing] BEAST'S EX: This is the end of our story. One last spell. [wind whistling] -[water rippling] -[gentle music playing] Thank you. [water bubbling] [blood splattering] [anticipatory music playing] [water splashing] [pensive music playing] -[gasping] -[dramatic music playing] [grunts] -[gasps] -[wind whistling] -[gentle music playing] -[water splashing] [singer vocalizing] [inhales deeply] [water splashing] [sniffles] [shovel tapping] [panting] [water splashing] [crickets chirping] -[gentle music playing] -[singer vocalizing] [Belle sobbing] [rooster crows] [shovel tapping] [liquid splashing] [patrons chattering] One, please. [liquid splashing] [glass shatters] You. Do I know you? Do you? I think... no? [patrons chattering] Unless... [gentle music playing] [♪♪♪] [singer vocalizing] [♪♪♪] -[soft music playing] -[vocalizing continues] [mellow music playing] [♪♪♪]
