THE BLACK BEACH Nothing! Hasn't changed in 30 years! From deepest exile, I remember all! And you, nothing! Me? Nothing? Yet it was you who took the revolution most seriously. Me? Seriously? Not I, not anyone. Nothing! Just the inkling... that it could only end badly for me, in any case. Did you listen to the radio? No. Athe border, 30 Shokors arrested, entered illegally from a neighbour state. Gun fire! Are you hiding? It's starting again. A the moment, almost every day. When we first met we feared nothing. But my mother was Shokor. Today, I realise the Shokor resemblance... I've certain physical features, as they say. Such as? My nose. My eyes. You mean, your sad clown look. Let's sit down. Joyce! Put your bag down and sit. In what sad foreign night did I first hear your laugh turning apathetic drinkers' heads in the yellow haze of brasseries? That horrible laugh. I know. A Shokor laugh. Back then he wrote lucid, ironic poems. For me the revolution wore flower names... Ironic! The names ofwomen I loved, women you loved... Gentian, Rose, Emma... It is he who remembers nothing. When you both returned from exile, atthe height ofthe People's Revolution, remember? We were crazy, every last one of us. And you were one ofthe three chosen by the crowd to negotiate with the President successor to our dictator... What for? To persuade him to resign? Shakespearean! I was spokesman: "Resign, as one last favour... "to the people." And he did. Today, he's in prison. Ofthe three of us who stood before him the first is our new president, the second formed an opposition party... Sent to prison! Upon the orders of the first... He now awaits trial. Who remains loyal? Who remains loyal? And the third, myself, at risk... It would only take that... Shakespearean! Loyal to what? And the banning of our review. Forgotten that? He's not the man you say he is. He'll not go any further. We were in school together, in prison together, and he withstood everything. Authoritarian, but he'd not renege upon our years of common struggle. He's still one of us. Emma, can you believe your ears? You reallythink that? What a clown! Before I leave you, I'd like to know what each ofyou loves most aboutyour capital. You're abandoning our homeland for Paris. What I love most, are the Shokor shrines in honour ofthe great man-eater. And you Emma? Me, I love its green gold domes and Paris. You abandon me. What I love most is the marble base ofthe mausoleum of our dear dictator... now disused. I am forsaken! Joyce is staying with me. Sylvie's leaving with an article. - The one you wrote together? - Yes. On what? The new spate of disappearances. Which might still interest a French newspaper? Where are you going? It's still going on... And then? We'll join her. Your voice is so sad! Distance yourself. Tomorrow I leave forthe Black Beach with Joyce. Your childhood home, which you haven't set foot in since... What age were you the last time you were there? Fifteen. Nostalgia, how you hold us! I don't get it. You told me you were joining Sylvie in Paris. Either she returns, or we join herthere. Itwon't be for long. Take some time out. Use itto write your memoirs, so eagerly awaited. To hell with you! Can one love life justforthe memory of dead friends? Worthless, Sider. Worthless! From your statelessness you've always drawn a bitter pride. And when you wrote: "l invented a country which doesn't exist. "l have invented a country "which doesn't exist. "l used to believe "that you were simply too small to have both a North "and a South. "But now I know... "that you do not exist." "To think of my country "do not say its name, "say flower, "bee, "tear... "hand, storm." I beg you. Stop! And you, what do you love most about our capital? The tramways, the sound of them. The tramways, they echo, they echo, in his memory, in his very memory. How beautiful! Elegance! "We live with a few acres ofthe past, "the happy lies ofthe present, "the furious torrent ofthe future. "May as well keep skipping on the rope "the dream child by our side." Not one of mine. Has she left? Taking yourtranslation? How I earn my living. My French translations of our great national author for his Paris publisher. Paid in hard currency? It's work I can do anywhere, preferably in peace. I doubt that you will find peace. Leave it... Still have it? Eternal vagabond, embrace me! When I die Think ofme Be happy Ifyou can Be happy Ifyou can What's in here? I don't know. Can we open it? Is it far? Is it far? Don't remember too well. Put it there, against the wall. So, travelling around? Excuse me, to have my phone reconnected? Your number and address. 9, the Black Beach. That number no longer exists. Must I make a written request? No. Your name and signature. We'll do the necessary. Can we buy one? Sure. It's pretty. Do you live in that house up top? Yes. I saw you from my boat. It's your boat? Yes. Do we have much? Not a lot. We'll meet again. Goodbye, Miss. Excuse me. I'd just like to check your papers. Thank you. We haven't had many girls like Joyce atthe school. And given who you are, your pastwhich I admire, a pastthey know, which they've learnt or imagined... You change the balance. They came to question us. We're notthe only ones. Already? Here, in the wilds, let it be known I'm no longer involved, in anything. Strange shadows pass at night between the sea and the Shokor houses. Your naivety amazes me. We must declare every new child to the police. I gave your name. So, tell me about Paris. You preferyour dad's country oryour mom's? When do you want herto start? The soonerthe better. Tomorrow? We didn't manage to find a bike for her. How about on the crossbar? Rather ride on the back? Ifyou need anything, don't hesitate to ask. There it is! Did the postman come? Yes. Where did l... Come on. Go getyour paintbox. Which colour? Red. For each passing day, we'll paint a pebble. Red. I decided we'd live somewhere remote, notfor long, in the house where I used to come as a child. With my daughter... Waiting... Exiled... Red. Look! Theywere in the letter. Let's play. Pretty! Very pretty! Gorgeous! Ugly! Very strange! Gorgeous! Very, very ugly! Hideous! - Wonderful! - Superb! No emotion. Pass. Naked! That's all. Very, very beautiful. Very, very beautiful. I win. I win. Really... Who is it? I don't remember. - Mom? - My little girl! -We gotyour photos. -Your voice, at last... Tell me. I saw Dad naked. He was sick. Can't hearyou anymore. I can't hearyou. Sylvie? Now I can hear. Can you hear me? You wrote me a letter, we got itthis morning. I don't remember... In your house as a child... - What? - In your house as a child. You remember nothing either. I remember myfather telling me to remember. There's a memory. Butto share memories with Joyce! - Do so. - They betray me. Make them up. When does my letter date from? Hold on... Two weeks ago. "I'll send you the invitation form "completed and stamped for your visa. "l couldn't produce proof offixed address in Paris "as mine is onlytemporary." Fixed address? You can't even have me over? Stop! Stop, I beg you. Can'tyou try to be a bit more gentle? You have to renewyour request in the capital, remember? I remember nothing anymore. Your daughter's going to sleep. She sleeps above you? No, in her secret room. Have you seen a doctor? Come back. You come back. You come too. No, you come back. The beach is a frontier even if over the horizon the nearest land is thousands of kms away. It's still going on. Only right that my body betrays me, my wife is not with me. Do you hear me? You hear? You want to? You hear? It will be calm tonight. Want to come fishing? What'd your father have done? He'd have been angry as hell. The Almighty and a friend, rolled into one... You couldn'twantfor more. Tomorrow I'll go and tryto find the photo. No, it doesn't matter! Paintyour pebble this morning? I am forsaken... A poor unfortunate... She no Ionger wants me. I'm going to Ieave her... Take the plane all alone. Liar! Come and dance. Put this on. I'm waiting. That's my father. And his brother... The fisherman, and the swim... Hold on. -Awhale! - Let's see. - No, squirrels. - Drewthem when I was little. Guess what's in this box. Awhale. - No, guess! - I don't know. All Mom's letters to me. I wantto read them. Let me read them. Where are you going? Athe heart of my solitude... and then, wait... Athe heart of my solitude, and then... wait. Where are you going? To take the plane alone. Yes. Not asleep? I had a dream. We were both on the boat. Me too. When I was little, I used to see the schooners from the house. I'd watch them heading out to sea, tacking into the wind, the boom plunging to the swell. With my father's big brass spyglass, as well as exploring the moon, we'd watch every move on deck. Sailors dashing about like in a silent movie. Stark outlines thatwould tremble in the heat haze. Today, the tankers change heading and approach. I can't sleep, I hear noises. Nothing stirs on deck. So you have memories. Well, well, well. You have memories? She was with you in your dream? Yes. Tell me a memory. I've forgotten them, but I'll make one up. Go ahead. I'm in mywife's arms... Sider's bodywas found on a dump in the capital. Sider, still in close contact with his party had recently abandoned political activity... His closest friend is said to be... Come back quickly. I can't. - Come quickly! - I can't. Why not? I can't. But why not? Our article on the disappearances went almost unnoticed, except by the Embassy officials. I'm banned from entering your country. I no longer have the right, I've no longer the right to enter your country. Forget our plans to educate Joyce bilingually, you must come back quickly, you must, you have to... She's growing up. She's growing so fast. You must come back, you must come back quickly... I'm going to the capital. I'll leave herwith the teacher. No, take herwith you. I beg you. Alright. Take herwith you. I beg ofyou. -When's the funeral? - ltwas yesterday. -Who was there? -Almost no one. Take my advice... the bestthing is to get up aboutthree in the morning to be atthe consulate at around four, atthe little door on your left. Write your name on the copybook. It's not official, but everyone knows about it starting with the gendarme screening the entrance. The first on the list may get in before midday when the visa request office closes. The afternoon is for collection. It takes three weeks from the date of request to process the visa. You can also come at your ease Iater on in the morning. The crowd is bigger but you can enrol and leave in the hope of being seen the next day, or the day after. It's not possible to say exactly at what time you'll be received, but you must be present when your name is called or you'll be struck off and will have to start over. You can also pay a professional to queue on your behalf before dawn. He'll write your name in the book and wait. When you yourself come later, he'll give you your receipt. For those who don't know French, the gendarme has a translation. I can no longerfathom those people. Before, they had an inexpressible something we so admired. I once knew some old Russians who only survived by reciting Pushkin, as ifthat Russia still existed. My French friends would smile atyour ghosts. Perhaps my France only ever existed in myyoung girl's dreams. You must've been beautiful at 20. Bastard! Like your new house? Dreamy and delicate. But unafraid of brutality. Perhaps you're right, my pet. I've got a lesson. You'll both be snug in your new bed. - Got many students right now? - Not enough. I'll be off. The keys. I can stay with Joyce ifyou need me to. Leave me a note. Now, sleep, sleep. Do you have your receipt? - Who are you looking for? - Mr Schwartz. A two-fifteen on the dot. So tell me, what do you do? On a visit, I thought to see the cultural advisor, but since you, Mr Schwartz are replacing him... He knows you? He knows me. So, what do you do? Translator. I wanted a visa for France. Translator? Well, what I can offeryou is: a stay of one month in a nice working environment in the heart of historic France. A grant. Here's ourform to fill in. - Visa? Here it is. - And for my daughter, so she can join her mother, mywife. That's more a matter offamily reunion, which as you know, have been suspended. Our cultural and consular departments are entirely distinct. The regulations are strict and applyto all. Given the flood of requests, I'm unable to intervene. An impossible tide of migration. I have all the documents. Bailiff! One can see you're not French. Fill in the form and come back. We're late, but I might still manage to hitch a wagon to the train. See him out. Good day. Go trythe consulate. Gendarme! Yourtranslation is beautiful... The vocabulary presents unusual difficulties... The manywords that have been corrupted bythe Shokor dialect. Mysterious! Itwas l, in myfirst novels who gave life to this once mythic people, who gave it a name, a history, grandeur... and even decadence. To all these words... I restored... their original lucidity. Impossible forthe French reader to share such semantic subtleties. Yetyourwork is remarkable. We are makers ofthe real, to which I bring the imaginary, the forgetting ofthe present, strange confusion, distorting mirrors, real country, invented country... Magic... Magic. Are there still brilliant French writers, passing through, who take young girls from the capital to eat cakes in the King of Sicily cafe? Hand me the book. Ifyou wouldn't mind... for my daughter's teacher, also a great lover of French. So what are your plans? I've been appointed cultural envoy in Paris with the rank of minister plenipotentiary. I don't have to tell you how stifling it is here. I've set myself a task: to restore my entire body ofwork. The remove will be beneficial to me. You'll still have a lot on your plate to translate me. Emma told me you're returning to Paris. You'll be my guide. Tell me, you knew Siderwell. What an appalling end! I am convinced that it had to do with sex. What do you think? Sider's homosexuality was an open secret. Do not hide that beautiful face. Grotesque! Five! Gilles! Been looking for you for 3 days. I've a letter for you from Sylvie. I'm so glad I found you. Back to snap the suburbs ofthe world? The world's one big suburb, you fool! Onlytrue Parisians can talk such nonsense! What are you doing? Whatwe all do in queues, waiting. They're with me. I'd told ourfriend -your name, I forget - there was but a single person in the capital able to help him in his enquiry and that person is of course you, whose work I know and admire. Don't blame Mr Schwartz, he couldn't have known. His role is to oversee the costly creation of a TV network, to further mutual dialogue and understanding. It's sure to interest you. We will of course be calling on you... as a go-between of ideas crucial to both ourfutures. That said, the embassy is on our backs, they're swamped. They're facing an uncontrollable flood of migration. A huge problem, both today and forthe future. I'll sort it out right away. Mr Consul, sorryto botheryou. Would you have a momentto spare for a visa? Thank you. He's on his way. So, what's the matter? It's for Sir here, whom we all know and whom we admire for his work and commitment. It all seems perfectly in order. As for the French passport for... Joyce. Your daughter? Even ifwe have no record of her, what matter. She's mentioned on her father's passport... You're her father? The visa will be automatically valid for you both. Come back tomorrow at four. Glad to be of help, so nice to meet you. We keep this. Not photographing these resigned bodies? To use or not to use a camera. "l don't have time to write a real letter. "l met Gilles, dining with friends, he told me "he was going to the capital. "Maybe you and Joyce can travel back with him?" - Drop you off? - No, I'll take the tram. I'm staying at the usual hotel. Stop by, we'll talk. Who were the friends you and Sylvie ate with? My squirrels were black? I don't remember. I tried to photograph them with my old box camera. I never managed to. I'll tell that to Gilles. I'll tell it to Joyce. Is that okay? As you like. It's ugly, but convenient. Last time I came, we felt it was a time of hope. And today? It's for you to say. My paper wants a brief on the return of democracy. You know French policy. No obstacles to investment here. No questions as to the new regime. We want disclosures. Make up ofthe new political class? Who today holds the reins ofthe economy? Is there a Mafia in league with former dictatorship top brass? Monetary adjustment? Isn't the Shokor minority question a potential powder-keg? Relations with neighbouring states? A host of issues. We also wanted to ask you to do an article on Sider's death. Gilles tells me, only you know... Ifyou prefer, we could do it as an interview. Those who killed Sider may be in this very hotel. I can't tell you any more. It's too late. He seems well enough where he is. You seem not to be, not here nor elsewhere. Sylvie has lots of plans for your future in France. What are yours? I've no plans. I want to buy something for Joyce. Not asleep? Let me sleep. I want to sleep. Opposite. So, it's you! I'd an appointment at four. The Consul had another engagement. It expires in two weeks... your passport! You know we can't issue a visa on a passport which expires during the stay. You'll have to go to the local police to have it extended or renewed. That's a bit annoying. But you'll have your passport. We got instructions to give you priority treatment. What do you want? To have it extended or renewed. Proof of address, rent receipt, tax returns, two lD photos, fifty dollars, to offset inflation, takes a week. Or try the emergency bureau, Ministry of the lnterior. The Police will send you a list of documents required for you and your daughter. Itwill take about a week. There's barely one blank page left. You've travelled a lot. Regulation stipulates thatwe must keep your passport. It'll be sent to the Police in your province of residence. In the capital... you learnt... the truth about... the death of... Come! This is my room. This is Mom's room. You have no room, it's full offurniture. Sorryto botheryou, I came to ask a favour... It's the fisherman. Rough seas last night. I didn't put out. I brought passengers... I'll hide them in the reeds. Butthere's a woman... Could you put her up forthe night? Alright. "That dream ofyours, "l had the same. Itwas wonderful. "You told me I was so very beautiful, "you took me in your arms..." "Yes, I took you in my arms, "you were very, very beautiful, my Sylvie." Now let's switch, I'll do Mom. And you do yourself, talking to Mom. "But it's me, Mom. You won't talk to me? I'm so sad." Stop! So we stop playing. No, we keep playing, but I do Mom. "Hello, can you hear me?" "Yes, Sylvie. Can you hear me?" "Yes, I hearyou my love. "Know how many days I've been alone "withoutyou, my love? "So you've forgotten me? "Well, I know. Eighty-nine days. "The police sorted out everything in the capital? It's taking ages." "Yes, I think so." "l write the days in a little notebook. "Why don't you want I come?" "I'd love you to, it's not I who doesn't want." "Joyce told me she'll kill the police. "She's tired of crying." "My girl is crying? "You know she's eating very well, and wants to be first in class." "No, she told me she's not eating, the food is so bad. "That she's afraid, and cries alone in her secret room." -Why is my girl afraid? - I'm Mom. Don't speak to me, speak to Mom! "You can tell me all, Sylvie... "l love you." - Speaking to me, or Mom? - To you. It's nottrue you love me. I tell you all. Butyou don't. We'll never go see Mom. You don't love her. I want herto come. I'm sick of playing. Call Mom! Your voice is strange. What's the matter? Are you in pain? No, I'll speak to you later. Joyce wants to talk to you. You're not to speak... Mom... He said we'd leave upon our return. He's a liar. Calm down. Come, Mom, I wantyou to come. Please, call me back. It's saferwhen you call me. Don't scare me! Don'ttouch me! Sleep. A story. In the cities of exile, you recall? We spoke ofthe future. It lit up ourwaiting, ourforeign nights. ...new upsurge ofShokor unrest over the "One Nation, One Language" Iaw. Student strike possible. ...arrests have been made in the capital. At the border... ...gangs of traffickers, underground Shokor groups... ...weapons seized. No right to be in my secret room. Go, I'm sleeping. ...storm warning, sailors should not put out in the next few days. "Brilliant things "are not done in dribs and drabs. "You have by nature fire in the breath." Who wrote that? Sider... the scholar... You don't answer? You are wrong. The world is not done for. Worthless, Sider! Worthless! - It's due to the storm. - Can I call from here? Your number? It'll soon be over. Tomorrow, I promise, if I don't hear from the Police I'll take a communal taxi and sort it out on the spot. Kiss Mom. Mom! I kiss you. Mom no longer speaks. Are you thirsty? - She's a friend ofthe fisherman? - I don't know. - Maybe she's afraid ofthe police. - Maybe. And can I see her? Did you speak to her? Did you speak to her? Look! It's so pretty! Know how to play? Take it easy, take it easy. If she'd stayed, I'd have told Mom. What'll we find after the storm? Manes of seaweed, Iumps of lava, pieces of shipwrecked schooners. Excuse me, no day to be out visiting. I came about your passport. I speak French, I've been to Paris. They wanted you to come with me to the police station, so as not to bother you further. They have a few questions to ask you. But with this bad weather, I'd enough trouble getting this far. It's still hot. Like some? If it's no bother. Where's the telephone? It's out of order. May l? Not working. Constantly engaged, that's not normal. I'll ask the post office to give me a priority line. - In half an hour. - Have a seat. I was told to give you this. Fondly, Gilles. Want a sweet? Oh, a Shokor tarot! Like to play with me? Show me how it's played. She's shy, but very pretty. I told them it could have waited till tomorrow. It's decided, we'll do the whole thing here. Just a few questions and then I'll leave you in peace with your passport. Your relations with the foreign press... Lastweek, you met two French journalists. You wrote a new article forthem and gave them an interview. We'd like the text ofyour article, orto knowthe information you passed on to them. I wrote nothing, I gave no interview. The fisherman who lives on his boat was to smuggle you overthe border. That's absurd! You are in contact with the Shokors. I've absolutely nothing to say on that. Tell me all and once the storm is over, we'll go. We're not monsters, but since the need arises... Don't move, whatever you do, don't move. just then, Joyce's cry rings out it races over the sea, spreading far, far and wide, further still... Subtitles: Peter Leonard Processed by C.M.C.
