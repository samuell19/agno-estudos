Alberto, come eat! Yes! Just like home. It's French cooking, but local-style! When you're broke, it all tastes good! I like people who're hungry, it's why I learned all my secrets as a chef. - Soon… - Yes! You'll have your restaurant in Marseilles. Yes, I'll have my own restaurant! And not only that! Other ideas? What do they want? Never mind, eat! Soldiers always mean trouble! Listen, everyone! This concerns all of you! Hurry up! Let's see what's up! "Pursuant to Art 36 of the Constitution, and Art 8 of the Law of May 8th, 1945, we hereby declare that: all diamond mining in the Guluve Valley… …must stop immediately. All diamond right are exclusively reserved… …for the State, or those designated by the Governor. The decree takes effect as of tomorrow. All miners must leave today, and any equipment not removed will be confiscated. Signed by the Provincial Governor: Roberto Guzman." Go. Go tell the others. What's it mean? It means we're being kicked out! Bastards! The State wants our claims! No! They belong to us! We've been had! I'll go talk to Captain Ferrero! Right! Let's go! Those who want to see Ferrero, follow me! The men sound upset. You're worried? Play, then you won't hear them. There will be trouble! Quiet, Lieutenant. Let me think. Captain, a delegation wants to see you! - How many? - At least 40. I'll see them according to regulations. - You understand? - Yes, Captain. Do it, then send them in. Another man lost! Calm down! Calm down! The captain will see you, but first you have to check your arms. You'll get them back as you leave, that's the rule! Well, Alberto? We won't give them our guns! But we're here to talk! You think we can talk to men like them? Be careful, comrades! Alberto is right! - An unarmed man carries no weight! - So, let's go! Checkmate, Captain! They won't give us their guns. I'm becoming fed up with those men… Lieutenant… - Get rid of that rabble! - At once, Captain! We wanna talk to the Captain! Calm down, comrades! Form ranks! I wanna talk to the Captain! Bugler! Prepare arms! Fire! Reload arms! Halt! Let him go! He's not a local. - Any cigarettes? - You're right! It's unfair! Dammit, what are we going to do? We got hardly any guns! If they get reinforcement, we're done for! The strong get justice on their own! The weak just shut up! You have to choose! Right! We can't let them bastards screw up our lives! They fire and we ran like sissies! They took us by surprise. But it ain't over! - Understand? - Not a word! Cheers! Go to hell! What's up? You ain't very talkative! Leave her alone! Who are you? I'm her dad! If you had kids, you'd act the same way! Fathers shouldn't talk big! Let me go! You old fart! It's OK now. Don't worry! Did he hurt you? The bastard! Are your shoes OK? The claims are ours! Talk will do no good! We gotta fight! He's right! We'll occupy our sites tomorrow! Bring guns! We'll need them! There's about 40 of them, and over 200 of us! They won't dare attack us! What if they do? The strong of today are tomorrow's weak! Who's he think he is? Father Lizardi, the missionary. What's he butting in for? It's my duty to warn you! - You'll be killed! - I ain't so sure! We can't let them fleece us like sheep! We ain't scared of Ferrero. Colonel Sandman's men are only a day's march away. - Can't you see? - We'll see later! It'll be a useless massacre. It will end in ruthless repression! Padre, you only been here two weeks. Mind your own business! Go convert some natives and get off our backs! We're big boys now, we don't need your advice. Alright… But you'll gain nothing! "He who lives by the sword, shall perish by the sword!" Threats? Enough talk! Let's go! What nice shoes, Maria! What can I do for you, Father? Father, you're right. Fighting leads to no good. I'm amazed you're with these rebels! You're a peaceful man, this isn't your fight. I'm peaceful, but they're my pals, we're all in the same mess. I'm talking as a friend, not a priest. Your daughter has no one but you, you'd risk your life for nothing? Father… You know my plan, make a nest-egg and leave! I agree with you! I hate fights. - Especially with the State! - Now you're thinking! Yes, I'm thinking. A man has to think. Maria, come on! - Bye, Father. - Bye! Oh, tell me… - Is Chenco's boat due in today? - What day is this? Wednesday. It will be here tomorrow. - Your watch shows the days? - Yes. It must cost a lot! Yes, but it's not mine. Our order was given some. See? - All our missionaries wear them - Very pretty. "N.R.C." "North Refining Co." "For our heroic Mambuti missionaries." Magnificent! Call me. I'm anxious to leave! Where's Chenco's boat go? To the chicle plantations before the Cumumi Rapids, near the Brazilian border. - You'll let me know? - As soon as he arrives, Father! Father Lizardi's quite a man! For his first mission, he's being sent… …among the wildest of the natives! He just might get his head shrunk! Big loss! This lighter? Five. Tell me… - You got rooms for rent? - No vacancies! Or you could stay with your horse in the stable! Tonight I'd like to sleep in a bed. Money will get you anything here. - Even a bed? - Yes, a bed. - But it's expensive! - Tell me where. Easy. Turn right as you go out, It's a house with an arch. - You can't miss it! - Bye. Anybody home? What are you doing here? Me? I'm in my bed! And you? - I guess I'm in your bed - You're not impressed? A good bed always impresses me. You're not very polite! Nice muscles! Strong men always please! But with me, it's different. I need… I see! Oh, no, small bills aren't my style. - You get big ones often? - Not as often as I'd like. Diamond hunters… …stimulate the imagination. So, I came to rot in this hole! But I manage! - You don't look the type. - Don't… Remember? There's a price. Well… That can be arranged. I got what it takes. Aren't you afraid with all that on you? Bodies are perishable! If anyone gets too close to my fortune, he's in trouble! You have an answer to everything! By the way, what's your name? Shark. - That hits hard! - Scared? And you? Me? They call me Djin. It's the native name for a bird. Like it? Not bad. On your feet and follow me. - What for? - You just follow me. - You explain first! - Sargent. Take him away! You'll pay for this… Take him away! I'll get you, bitch! Here… - For you. - Thanks, Mr. Chenco. - Thank you very much, Mr. Chenco. - You'll pay me back next month. Remember! Money's all that counts! Right, Mr Chenco. It's a great spot for gals who know how! Diamond miners spend plenty. I'm the opposite, a real miser. Right you are, OK… You can get off now! Good luck. It's your money-pack? - Who else's? - It's your money too? Mine and no one else's! Did you come through Cimaruna? Never heard of the place! Sure? Why would you go there? You're a nice guy… Some foreigners held up the bank in Cimaruna. - Well? - Not me! You were seen in Cimaruna! - I never been there! - Oh, no? Bring him in! - Good day, Captain. - Good day, sir. You know this man? I've seem him around, but… Was it in Cimaruna? Yes! He's one of the bank robbers. I saw him on the posters! How much do they pay you for this? Sorry, Captain. Take him in the jeep to the Cimaruna police! Not that! He'll shoot me for trying to escape! Lock him up! Congratulations, Captain. - You handle things well! - Wait, Chenco. We have to discuss business. They ambushed us. We couldn't even fight back. Idiots! You have guns, use them! Who shot the corporal? Not me! Put the bastard in jail! Maria! Listen, Maria. Throw that away! My baby… There's nothing left for us to do here. We'll go home, to France! It's my country! We have quite… …a bit of money. You'll be happy there. You'll get medical care! Maybe, we won't leave alone. There's a lady who likes you. And I like her too… Maybe she'll come with us, you wouldn't mind? No? Angel! You always want to please your dad! There! Isn't she pretty? She's to answer me tonight. I wanna talk to you. What's wrong? I've thought it over. Tell Captain Ferrero… …I don't like the deal. He always takes too much! Don't get upset. We need him, and you know it! That's no reason… He needs us too. I'm about ready to quit. Now, don't worry… I'll make him cough up. - Trust me? - Sure! You got trust written all over you! Djin, I wanna talk to you. - Go ahead. - Not here. There? Well… What's on your mind? How do you feel about Castin? Castin? He's a decent guy. - That's all? - That's not so bad! Most of the guys around here are bastards! Well, the decent guy wants to marry you. What? That's a funny one! So, he sent you? I wanted to know what you think about it. What I think? Hey, a gent's asking for my hand! What do you say? I'm serious! Can't we laugh a little? That's a good one! So? What's your answer? Look, Alberto, you know who I am, don't you? So, this shakes me up a bit! That guy used to come here a lot, now he ain't been in for two months. To top it all, he's always in church! I can't see how you two are pals! Castin don't care about bourgeois prejudice. He offers you a good, honest family. My ideas go along the same lines. Castin's a decent man, and that means a lot. An honest family with me? And he's no spring chicken! No, it's not a good deal for me. Who is it? I'm going for the accounts. Alright. Don't make a mistake subtracting! Castin is 68, and has pockets full of dollars. He wants to buy a restaurant. This climate's worn him out, you'd soon be a young widow! See? You're sure he's loaded? He's got more than any of us. Tell him to come see me tonight… …for a talk. You're a bitch! I wanted to see what you really are! You're worse than I thought. A nice guy tries to help you, and you only want his cash! You want him to die fast! Disgusting! What's with you? I never said money scares me. Don't anyone move! Any hidden guns? Yes, sir, here! Hands up. Get their guns. Now get the hell outta here! Remember, Alberto, to tell Castin to come see me tonight! Go on! Into the street! Whenever you wish. Here, Father. How is he? Like a guy short on blood! My son… Your friend's tended your body as best he could. I wish to console you in the name of Our Lord and His Church. Great! Me with a slug… - In my hide! - Don't be bitter, my son. Think of your soul. Screw off! I wish to help you. Don't consider me as an enemy. I'm a man… …who wants to ease you misery. I ask only… …that you repent. Let me lead you to God. Leave me alone! Alvero… Don't refuse the priest! Listen to him, he can help. Then go confess to him, but leave me alone! A guy like you knows how to face a firing squad, but afterwards? The priest can help you for that. Your comrade's right, my son. Forget your pride. God is all-powerful. Repenting don't cost a thing! Shut up, churchy! Poor lad! I can do nothing more here. You did your best. Thank you. I'll be just outside. OK, Father. Oh, Father… Would you do me a big favor? Yes, my son, if I can. Well… I don't know what they're gonna do to me. But I left my old mother in Europe… …when I came here to get rich. You see the mess I'm in, I'd like to write to her. Then, I want to confess… I'll confess you! Do you have a pen and paper? No, but I'll ask the guards. Guard, open up! Get the man pen and paper. - I can't! - Get them, a pen and paper. I'll take the responsibility. - OK, Father. - Thanks. Father! He's lost consciousness. He must be dying… Don't bother! - It's a good one. - Thanks. I want a firing squad before midnight! But, Captain, we will execute him in the night? Why not? He'll be an example! I'll show the mob I'm not fooling! Squad! Look, Alberto! Leave me alone! Present… …arms! Aim! - No more death penalty! - Assassin! Go! Got any ammo? Make do with that! It's full! Gimme the revolver! Shall I come? No need. I know the way! Reinforcements? Tomorrow at eight! - Under whom? - Colonel Sandman. A machine-gun platoon and 100 infantrymen. Who is it? It's me, Castin! Leave me in! Quick! - You're hurt? - It's nothing! I can explain. - In the fight? - Yes. You should come here instead! But I didn't do a thing! "Due to the bloody riot in this peaceful locality, caused by mostly foreign adventurers, we declare a state of martial law. The leaders are known to us, and will be tracked down. Two of them have already died. The two in hiding are: Castin, who incited the men to riot; Shark who blew up the powder kegs. A 5000 peso reward is offered for them, alive or dead. If they are not found in 24 hours, four of their comrades chosen at random will be shot. Signed, Colonel Sandman, Commander of Cuchazo." Alone? Where's your father? Your dad! Where is he? Wait… Your dad is out? It's dangerous outside! I must talk to him! Please tell me! He didn't sleep here? Why did you come here, to hide? I didn't plan things this way. You expected an invitation? No, but I thought… I thought of you as my wife. So, here. I see. Don't say I'm here! - Who is it? - Please open the door! I must see Castin… It's urgent! Come in. Here. I hesitated coming for you in such a place. - Father, I can explain… - First, listen to me! I never thought you'd lead such a riot! - I didn't! - Yes, yes, right! The army saw you with the agitators! They shot at you? Some have already died. - Now, they're after you. - Me? - But… I didn't do a thing! - You did nothing! I wasn't even there. Listen to me. If you're not found in 24 hours, four hostages will be shot! The reward for your capture… …is 5000 pesos! - 5000 pesos? - That's terrible! - But I can't do a thing! - My son, you can! First, you should leave my place. I'm not mixed up in this mess! - What should I do? - Do? - Give yourself up to save the four men - Give myself? - But I didn't do anything! - Innocent men will be shot! Innocent, innocent! But I'm innocent too! I didn't fire a shot! I wasn't even armed! You know that! This person's testimony… Meaning what? The colonel's witnesses, say you're guilty! Four lives depend on you! I told you I did nothing! I won't turn myself in, I'm innocent! Tell him, Djin! You gotta beat it! Or I'll get screwed! - But I'm innocent! - So, go and tell them that! I'll see the colonel with you, I promise. You'll save the hostages' lives! Open up! We wanna see if Castin's there! Open the door! Give him to us! Not to the soldiers! I'm gonna break down the door! They'll turn me in! Father, do something! What will my daughter become without me? Don't I count at all? Get the hell outta here! How do I do that? - By the back alley. - They'll see me! It's impossible. If they find you here, I'm done for! What a way to behave! And Castin? He's not here. Don't lie to us! - He's not here! - Why didn't you open? - I was busy. - Busy? Let's have a look! Ferrero's in jail and they're checking on his friends. We gotta scram. Be on my boat tonight and we'll go together. No sign of him. And in there? That's my room. Get out of the way! Father Lizardi! I never thought he'd do that! I never thought a priest'd go so far as to… He's giving Djin confession! Brethren, don't judge me by appearances. Brother? In my family, we're honest and frank. - Wait until this gets around! - Seen all you wanted to? - Happy? - We've seen plenty! Then get the hell out! - Go, go! - We're going! Sorry we interrupted, Father! Father… I heard it all. It's terrible! Don't talk about it. I need to meditate. Hard to be judged when you ain't guilty. - I was really in a sweat. - And what about him? The bastards! And you wanted me to go out, and be torn to shreds! I don't know what got into me. But, put yourself in my shoes, If they'd found you, I'd have been ruined! I lost my head. But I hid you all the same. I'm only a woman, and all alone! But… No longer. Now we're together! Let's not discuss it any more. Besides, I got you into this mess. I have to get you out of town. Sure, but how? Chenco's boat! Well? He sails tonight. He's going to Rio Mambuti, in the other side is Brazil! So what? I'll put you on Chenco's boat! But, you know Chenco! He'd turn me in for the 5000 pesos! No, I'm done for! But you're not! - I'm going without you! - Listen, Djin… You saved me! You're like my own wife now. I wanna prove it to you. Here! These diamonds… …are all our fortune! You carry it. I'll go get my daughter, try to take her aboard with you. I'll hide till dark, and then try to get aboard. It's my only chance! But… If I don't make it, promise me you'll be a mother to her. OK? OK. Castin! We're casting off! Once we're gone, I'll buy off Chenco. - Maria? - She's here. You undid your bandage! Get moving! Go on! Not a sound! Where's your boss? Where are you going? Answer me! - Where is he? - Calm down! Drop your knife! Take his gun! He's dangerous, Chenco! - Knock him out! - Get out! Go get the soldiers! 5000 pesos right out of the sky! Sorry, Father… But money's money, I want that reward. Put the motor in gear! I'll take the wheel! Oh, no! Don't leave us like that! We're gonna have a nice trip together! Stay there and don't move. So, we meet again. Full speed! Get down, you idiot! Here's my share. Chenco got a share too. Nothing, Lieutenant. They have a ten-hour lead. We must stop them before they reach Brazil. Our boat's three times faster than Chenco's, we'll catch them before dark. Cast off! If we go aground or anything happens, you're dead! - In the bag. - There's guns too. Castin, take that. Grab some ammo. The rest overboard! All of it? We can't let Chenco use it! Where are you taking me? Wherever you want, Father. You must put me ashore so I can reach the native mission at Santa Rosalia. Leave them alone, they'll be better off. No one will force them to work. Thanks to the missions, many tribes have now heard the Word of God. From their foremen's mouths! That's not our fault. But they follow you everywhere! They really love you. I won't argue with you! Put me ashore at once. I'm in command here. Get that in your head and we'll be OK. I serve only one master. You don't scare me. We'll see. Castin, you're wrong to aid… …such scum! What else can I do, Father? I was innocent, and they set a price on my head! Don't you hear anything? Sounds like a motor. Any other boats around? The Turica Bamba army launch. Then we must land fast! Grab all the supplies you can. Go on, move! That's enough! Let's go! The boat's drifting away! My suitcase is on it! You won't need it in the jungle! The boat will sink! It's not yours to dispose of! - It's how I make my living. - You won't be living long! Walk in front. Walk! - Kill him? - What's it to you? Don't kill me, please! - Take all my money! - And leave you here to betray us! I know the jungle! You'll get lost! - You'll starve! - He knows the jungle inside out. Fine! Walk in front with him. - If he runs, kill him. - Alright, go. Forward. Come on. Walk! You know the region. How far to Rio Mambuti? I don't know. It could be three days or twenty. It depends on the jungle. Which direction do we take? Due west. No doubt about that. You make me laugh! How do you know where west is, with all the detours we've made? Don't be silly! We follow the sun. The sun! It's given you sunstroke! Look, honey… We must get out of this… - One way or another. - I don't have to! Nobody's after me! I'm going to the river. Out of the question! Nobody's gonna squeal to the soldiers. At least, nobody who's alive. See? We're all together to the end. And yet, we agreed yesterday… Come on! Once in France we'll have… - …my seaside restaurant - "My seaside restaurant!" You old slob. Miserable fool! I'll never make it! It's all your fault! Leave me alone! You make me sick! You're old and ugly! Here's your nest-egg! That's right. I'm fed up! She's ruthless. Who asked for your opinion? But she's always underfoot! Is you song over yet? Keep quiet! Get some sleep. - Tomorrow will be a tough day. - Impossible, impossible. Get up! I can't sleep like this. Tomorrow I'll be worthless. - You'll sleep! - His rest is in our interest. - Mine is to keep him here! - Where could he go? I'll answer for him. Tie him in front. Turn around! The bastard! The bastards had it all planned! They had supplies for a week. Let them starve! I'll spoil their appetite. Let's see! - They had a lot? - I don't know what they took. We must set out quickly, Lieutenant! They may be out of the cavern Bring that. Let's go. Lieutenant, may I move off to the right and cut them off? No need! The river's their sole hope. They can't come this way because of us. They're in the forest. They'll never get out. Bring that! That's all we needed! What happened? Stay near dad! What's wrong? I twisted my ankle. It's only a sprain, walk or it'll swell. - I can't. - Try! And Chenco? It's settled. - The supplies? - Get them if you can! What's wrong? I sprained my ankle. Father, that's how to do unto others! I'll pray to God to forgive you. Let's waste no time. Come on. Come on! - It hurts! - Walk! You'll get over it Everybody can keep up… Except you! They've got pains too. Nothing! You said you'd bring back food. What can I do? The leaves are too thick to see animals! I just fire at random. With a carbine! If only I had a hunting rifle! No one can walk without eating! - We've no choice. - I can't go on! If we stop, we'll die here. Maybe we should! Well? No clearings in sight! We'll never cross those high hills… …out there. - We will! We have to! - In our shape… What's wrong with all of you? You wanna die here? - The bugs will eat you alive! - I don't care! - Castin! - What? You still think we'll make it? God has condemned us! - Father? - Let God alone! We'll all die alike! The innocent and guilty! Quiet! I don't wanna drag a sick man with us. It's no good. We'll never escape! God's already refused to feed us. Shark… What do we do? Try to find a way further south. We must keep going! As long as we've strength enough to walk! Shark, look! It's too damp! Here. It'll be good. How's the fire? It won't light! Not if you go at it like that! Give me some twigs! It's sure not easy. Everything's wet. There's nothing drier? Try that. It's the same. Everything's rotten here! We're done for… one for! It'll happen to the others too! Sooner or later! Maria did nothing. Sit down. Animals are everywhere. Hunting and eating one another! We can't find a one! Obviously. They only come out at night Daytime, they hide. We're not used to hunting for breakfast! My friends, do you hear me? Maybe hunger's made me delirious… I'm obsessed! Obsessed by the story of an egg! Soft-boiled eggs. It was when I was at the seminary. I must tell you about it! I was in my second year of theology, I recall the dining hall, and its tables like it was yesterday. We were ten per table, the seminarist who served was a fat boy. He was a nice lad. He did everything correctly… Except, each time we had soft-boiled eggs… Four or five always disappeared. There was no explaining it… Until the day we caught him eating them two by two, on the way from the church to the dining hall. I mean, from the kitchen to the dining hall. Even so, he became the coadjutor in my home church. My mother's name was Mary… - Hurt? - Yes… Get up, I'll help you. Don't be mad at me for the other night. I was feeling blue. I'm not mad at you. We're all guilty. None of us are without blame. Don't talk that way all the time… We'll have our restaurant! Oh, no. There will be no restaurant… Nothing! Come on, Castin! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I'll go on alone! Look! It's not an old fire. It's still intact. It's hardly damp. People must be near! Then, we're saved? Let's catch up with them! They'll help us! We don't know who they are. They may be head-hunters… Or escaped convicts! Why expect the worst? They may be explorers. Men of good will! We'll try? Look for other traces. We lit this fire. We've gone in a circle! If we stay here, we're done for! Let's go! Djin, come on. Keep trying! Lizardi… Try to convince her. No. Hope's all that kept her on her feet. We must do something! I'm going on ahead. I won't die without fighting! - I'll come with you. - No. I won't leave them alone with this madman! One of us must stay here. You're right. If I'm alive, I'll be back. Shark… If we don't meet again… - I thought you were just… - A bandit? Djin, our miseries are over! Look! Look! You'll see! No more bugs, or forest! Get your strength back! We'll have to walk a ways. Where were you? Where did you find all that? You wouldn't believe me! Eat first. You'll see later! We'd lost all hope. God saved us miraculously. Thanks to you, Shark! Funny… Some 50 people had to die to save us. Are you sure we're saved? It looks like a lake. It must be Lake Tocochapa on the Rio Mambuti We've only one thing left to do. Build a raft, and float with the current… Until we meet a boat. That's not all. We must fulfill our duty to the dead. Come on, Castin! Come on! What you staring at? I'm ugly, right? You don't look good… I wanna thank you for everything. I like you. Me too. Ever since the first day. You slept like a kid, with your mouth open. You proved it to me the first day. Let's have a swim. Jewelry… Where did you find them? Where? Here, I'll put them in a safe place. So we can give them back later. They're not yours, Maria! They belong to the dead… To the dead, and their families! You're very bad to act this way! You can't have them! You've always liked it… Hurry! It's yours. Well, Maria… What's wrong? What happened? Father Lizardi was mean to you! Mean! His watch, I don't understand. Don't be sad. We're saved, it's Brazil! It's your father? Your dad? Right… He's sick, your dad. He'll get treatment once we arrive. Anyway, I could take his place. Like to have me as your dad? I like you very much! God's cursed us! - He's punished us… - Don't talk like that! God makes His own decisions. Until now, I've been lenient, but no more! God alone knows who He'll punish or spare! God's justice will soon be heard! You're beautiful! A real lady. Look! A fortune! Where did you find it? - In the lake! - Fifty-fifty! - I found the plane! - In fact it's for you. All of it! And the girls as well. I hadn't understood. You're nice when you want to. No. It's just that we're both alike. We could get along together. Like that? All at once? May I? Beauty for the beautiful. No… Not all of a sudden. I liked you at once, but we got off to a bad start. You were mad at me. And for good reason! Walking in the forest, it came to me… A woman? She's nothing without a man. There! You're ready for a new life. Beautiful, huh? We may have… …trouble with the priest because of that. Let's beat it. The two of us. Yeah, sure! But we can't leave the girl. The girl? Don't think about her! I want a man all to myself, it's never happened before. Getting sentimental? Don't you believe me? You don't trust me? Sure, I trust you… I really love you, Shark. It took me a while to see it. I'm so happy… …that I want to cry! It's incredible! Hide, Lizardi! You'll get yourself killed! He'll kill us all! Stay with Maria! - I'll get behind him! - What for? - To kill him! He's raving mad! - Wait! - Maybe I can calm him down. - No! I'll talk to him… Castin! Don't shoot, I want to talk to you! Castin! You know me! Lizardi! I trust you! In God's name, I beg of you! Stay there! Don't move!
