I don't know your story, but please leave. So what happened? My man ran off leaving a pile of debt and this boy. What a man. I was foolish to trust him. Why didn't you go to the Welfare Dept.? I hardly expect the authorities to help us. At least they'd feed and shelter you. I should have known better. I was wrong. I regret sneaking in. I was just surprised. I lead a quiet life. We were starving. If I'd known, I'd welcome you. You didn't look like you would. You should have tried anyway. I'm Manzo. Mitsuko. What's your name, boy? Masao. Manzo. Masao. Stay here as long as you want. You shouldn't say that, we broke in your house. Why not? I could invade your heart anytime. But we'll inconvenience you. I'm suffocating here alone. I need someone to stir the air. You'll have to feed us, too. Even a feast tastes bad when eaten alone. Any food shared with you will taste good. Flatterly. I don't ever want to eat alone again. Never again. In fact, I want you to stay. A rose, by any other name... Would smell as sweet as you. You have a big heart. As big as a snot. Boo! Boo! Listen Masao, a man must be able to read maps.

Where did you find it? Someone gave it to me. It's beautiful. I envy you. You want to swap it for mine? I only just got it, so I shouldn't. Sorry. Want one? I'll ask him. Really? What are you doing? Eat. Hey! Eat it. Hey! I made them for you! Try them! New here? Yes. You're very pretty. Let's get together. I know this area backwards. Let's go to a disco tonight. I'll buy you drinks. I know a good place. What are you doing? I made lunch for everyone. They know how to make their own. They don't need yours. I can't help feeding people who look hungry. Please stay away from other men. Was what I did so bad? I don't want any whiff of scandal. Can I borrow your car? What for? I want an explanation. I'll drive into space. What for? I want to see Earth from space. Romantics never live long. Wanna bet? Why are you so confident? I want an explanation. Here. All of a sudden, there are new women everywhere.

What the hell? Can I have that one? It's the last one. But, you can have it. Not much food recently. It might just be me, though. Fuel prices have gone up. Shall I look for a job? Can you wash dishes? Of course I can. Can you serve customers? Of course I can. Any problems, just ask your colleagues. Of course I will. Well, you're hired then. Of course. Here they are. What's the next order? What will you have? A combo meal with hot milk. The combo with hot milk. I'm going out for a bit. This late, where? To work. I'll take you there. I'm okay. It's late, I'm worried. I'll be fine. I'll go with you. No need for that. Mitsuko. You left this. You haven't worn it recently. Tell me what's wrong. Nothing. I love you, Mitsuko. I love you from the bottom of my heart. I'm madly in love. I can't control myself! You fell over? Manzo! What happened? He collapsed. He was born ill. He was well until yesterday. He's fought against it. We need money to get him hospitalized. Hey, what are you doing here this late? Nothing really. It's our anniversary. We had French food in town. It wasn't that good but the wine was all-you-can-drink. We wanted to go alone, but we took the boys anyway. I'll send you a gift later. No need. You tend to your own problems. Change your clothes sometimes. It can change your life. Why do you look so down? Explain it clearly. No, it's nothing. You two go on ahead. Watch the road. You look very down. I've never really had any motivation for my work. I've really nothing to live for. I know I can kill myself anytime by jumping onto the propeller. All I ever catch is fish. How can I go on like this? It's not just my hands that are rough and gnarled. I don't want your pity, I'd kill you first. Tell me if you need more. Where are you going? He went and sold his boat. Masao, what are you doing? I'm not really sick at all. What about the hospital? Mitsuko made it all up. Explain it clearly. She painted all the spots on my body. She told me not to tell you or she'd pinch me. Is that true? Where did she go? I don't know. She quit. Good. Masao, here's a big one. Been waiting long, sweetheart? Your lunch. It's hea rt-shaped. Eat up. Dinner's ready. Thank you for this meal. Thank you for this meal. It's a big fish. They're in season now. Let's go to that new hamburger place tomorrow. You haven't had one before, have you? No. How about you? I used to, when I was young. I tried to eat my hamburgers with a bit of class. Usually, people hold a hamburger with both hands. But I did it with one hand, looking very cool. Really?
