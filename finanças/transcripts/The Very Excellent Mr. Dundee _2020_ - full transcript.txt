[Man] You've got to do something. [Hogan] Why have I got to do something? [Man] Because I don't really like snakes! [Hogan] I don't like 'em either. Why don't we just turn around and... go back the way we came up? 'Cause everyone's watching. Please. Mr. Dundee. Oh... Yeah, come on. Mr. Dundee. [Man] Go, Dundee! [Hogan] I'm not really Crocodile Dundee, you know. Just a character I play in a movie. He's being modest. That movie was practically a documentary. [Hogan] Shut up, Barney! Stand back, everyone. Boys. Oh. Shit. Be careful. [Barney] Here's a stick! [stick whooshes] He'll have that thing on the barbecue tonight. [chuckles] It's dead. [chuckles] [laughs] [Teacher] Um, yeah, not that one. Huh? Could you get the other one? The other one? Oh, is there... Ooh, Jesus! Shit. Everything okay? [snake hisses] [screams] [All clamoring] Oops. [screaming continues] As hilarious reports continue to surface of Paul 'Crocodile Dundee' Hogan's ill-fated rendezvous with a snake... we ask where the Man from Down Under has been hiding. [Man] The one-time rigger on the Sydney Harbor Bridge first got his big break on Australian talent show New Faces. [Woman] He instantly became a household favorite, and quickly, this everyman went on to star in his own sketch comedy series, The Paul Hogan Show. [Man] Dominating the Australian ratings over a 14-year period made 'Hoges' a household name and introduced such iconic characters as Arthur Dunger, Luigi the Unbelievable and stuntman extraordinaire Leo Wanker. The world beckoned, and as Hoges fronted Australia's most successful tourism campaign, we booked our flights and flocked Down Under in droves. It was then Hogan unleashed... the most successful independent film in the history of cinema... [Man] Crocodile Dundee. [O'DELL] ...Crocodile Dundee, of course. [Woman] ...Crocodile Dundee. That's not a knife. That's a knife. [Woman] The low-budget Aussie comedy went on to gross over $300 million worldwide and saw Paul Hogan co-host the 1987 Academy Awards and made him one of the most recognizable faces on the planet and a national treasure. Growing up in Australia, there was one name that was... beyond an idol in a way, and I'm just gonna say one word - Hoges. [cheering and applause] Hoges was your everyman. Hoges was the Aussie you wanted to be. [O'Dell] In 1989 came Dundee II and saw Hogan move to live in the US. [Frazier] More films were to follow, but all failed to capture the same success as Crocodile Dundee. [Man] And almost overnight, Hogan disappeared from American screens. And apart from a brief cameo in a new Australian tourism campaign... ...has rarely been seen again. [Woman] If you want to know what the notoriously private star has been up to these past 20 years, your guess... is as good as mine. [Woman] What the hell was that?! [Hogan] What? You threw a snake at a fifth-grade teacher and hit her in the face! Oh. Oh, she thought I was the real Crocodile Dundee. So you threw a snake at her? Oh, no. That was an accident. The bloody thing leapt at me. Right. And yet she thought you were the real Crocodile Dundee? [laughs] Yeah. He probably would have eaten it. Paul, I hardly have any clients left as it is. Could you just please try not to kill yourself? Okay. Thank you. Uh, where are we going? Oh. I have news. Oh. Yeah! See this letter? What? Well, God knows why, but apparently the Queen of England wants to bestow you with a knighthood. [laughs] What for? For services to comedy. Services! God! I don't want a knighthood. Well, you're getting one. So this is serious? Oh. Look at that. There's that Dundee impersonator. [Hogan] Oh, he's still here. [chuckles] I hate it. You know, people keep telling me he's strung out. Photo with Mick Dundee? Hey? Crocodile man? [Hogan] They're all strung out. Yeah, but he doesn't even look like Dundee! And apparently he's rude to the kids and then charges them something like $5 just to take his picture. Well, this is Hollywood Boulevard. They're all crooks. Yeah, I know. Oh, and, yes, this is very serious. Oh. Oh, yeah. They want me to appear in person. Six weeks from now in London. [laughs] I know! How great is that? [scoffs] I'm not going. Wait. But... What? You are. Wh-why would I go to... I mean, I've been trying to retire for the last 20 years. I know. [Hogan] You know me. I'm lazy. I like to stay at home and watch Ellen on TV and do crossword puzzles. But despite all that, it seems the Queen is actually quite the fan. Oh. [laughs] I know. I'm not surprised. I mean, come on, you put Australia on the map. You had the most successful independent film in history, Paul. I mean, you've got to think about your legacy. My legacy? Having a legacy is a beautiful thing. As your manager, I am telling you, you've got to do this. Oh, and in the meantime, can you just try and behave yourself? Because, you know, the palace hates any kind of... controversy or trouble. Hey, I never cause any controversy or trouble. You know... sometimes it... just comes after me. [Hogan] What are we doing here? [Angie] Okay. Don't be mad. But the studio really, really wanted a meeting. [Hogan] Angie, I've been telling you for 20 years, I don't want to do another Dundee. I know, but they've got some really amazing casting news. Seriously, I have never heard the studio this excited and bursting with ideas. So I told them we'd take a meeting. Oh, come on. Just do it for me? Please? Can we meet with them? And then you can go home, take a nap and watch Ellen. [chuckles] All right. Come on. Okay. You know what? I can't go. I've got to meet Mom. But you go ahead. You'll be great, trust me. I'll call you later! [starts engine] Love you! [cackles] Oh, look! Everyone, there's Paul Hogan! Hey. Hey, Paul. Kim Courtney. Pleasure. Paul, it's an honor. Thanks for coming in, Paul. We heard you were very excited to meet. Uh... yeah. Let me just start by saying that we are huge fans of the Crocodile Dundee movies. And we want to bring him back. We know you've been a little resistant in the past, but please, just hear us out. We'd really love to see Dundee... come to Los Angeles. [Hogan] Dundee in LA? Exactly. Like we did in Dundee III? There was a Dundee III? Are you sure? Mmm, reasonably. Here we go. Drinks! Ha ha! One sunrise kiss with added kale. Thank you. Roland, blended oats and chai supreme. Ah. Thank you, Anton. Ah, Josh. Yes, siree. Lemon and rocket essence. Perfecto. Now, Paul... Uh, no, I'm... I made you my favorite, which is a cleansing blend of mint, goat's milk, activated walnuts and baby spinach with agave syrup. Ooh! Agave syrup! Yeah. Thanks. [Kim] Take a sip. [Roland] Yeah, yeah. Drink. Sip. [Kim] Come on. Hmm? Hmm? It's good, huh? Yeah. There it is. [laughter] Anton! Okay. Let's forget the location. We want to introduce your son. A Dundee Jr. You know, someone who shares all of your qualities and attributes but who can bring the franchise forward for a younger, new generation. Yeah, well, we've already been down that road, and it, um... didn't sort of work. Yes. But this time, we have just the actor. He's A-list, he is charming, funny as hell... A little bit cute. He is perfect. And a massive, massive fan. So, without any further ado, to play your son... Will Smith! [Others laugh] Will... Smith! Look at him! Oh, he can't believe it! Believe it, Paul! He wants to play your son! Yeah! Yeah, but... Okay. We know what you're thinking. He's too old. No, that's not what I'm thinking. But he's just turned 50 and he looks great. Yeah, I'm sure, yeah, but... What? He's American? He's fantastic with accents. We'll get him a voice coach. But that's... not the problem. It's just that he's... Hey, Barry! Ah! We got Paul Hogan here! We're just discussing the Dundee casting. My man! Crocodile Dundee! [Hogan] Hey, Barry. Sorry, Paul. You were saying? Well, it just doesn't make sense. It's just that he's... Hey, Kyle! Yes? Bring that thing in here. [Kyle] For sure. So we can show our excitement. [All] Ah! [Kim] Oh, great! Perfect! Perfect timing. [Barry] It's a crocodile. [chuckles] Sorry, Paul, you were saying? Oh, yeah, well... You don't seem too sure about Will... What is it? You can tell us. Mmm. Be honest. Is... is it height? No... His build? No... What, his hair color? Closer. His acting? No, I... I love Will Smith. I think he's fabulous. He's great. But, um... What? What is it, Paul? He's black. [seat squeaks] You did what? I didn't do anything! Paul, not more than 20 minutes ago, I told you to behave yourself, and now you suddenly decide to become a racist? Racist? Oh, rubbish! They said you said you didn't like Will Smith because he was black. No! I just said it makes no sense that me and the equally white Sue Charlton have an African-American son. God, Paul! You can't say that! Oh, I'm fairly sure I already did. Now I know why my dad always wanted to quit managing you. He never wanted to quit. Paul? Um, what do you say we just keep this Will Smith stuff to ourselves, huh? And you just try and behave. I'll try. Okay. Bye. Oh... God! [door opens] [dog whines softly] [door closes] Paddy?

[O'Dell] All right, finally, the excitement of Paul Hogan returning to the public eye was short-lived, with some now asking whether the Australian actor threw the snake as a publicity stunt in a vain attempt to reinvigorate his acting career. His acting career? [chuckles] I think you're being too kind. [phone rings] Hi, Grandpa! Oh, Lucy! How are you, love? What time is it over there? Not sure, but early.

Oh, I'd love to, kid, but, um... it's too far away. Mum said you've been getting in trouble. [Hogan] Who, me? [Lucy giggles] You! [Hogan] Nah. She's probably getting confused with someone else. Oh. [sighs] I wish you'd come back home, Grandpa. Oh, believe me, kiddo, I'd be back there in a heartbeat if I thought my poor old dog Paddy could handle the flight. Especially now that Chase is doing so well over here. Yeah. I've heard about Uncle Chase. [chuckles] [laughs] Yeah! Never ceases to amaze me, that kid. I think he's running a nightclub out of his bedroom. [Lucy giggles] So, how's the new school going? It's okay. Made any new friends? Grandpa? Yeah? I love you. Oh, I love you too, sweetie. I'd better get going. Bye! [Man] Valet? Oh, yeah. Kimmel had a good one on you. Oh, yeah, and Colbert. He did a good five minutes on you. Great. For somebody who just wants a quiet life and to be left alone, you're not doing a very good job of it. Nah, I'm not, am I? Hey, talk is you're now taking to hate crimes. What next, the Klan? The studio! They wanted Will Smith to play Dundee Jr! Will Smith? Yeah! That's ridiculous! I know! I'll play Dundee. What, you thought I'd retired? I did Die Hard, for Chrissakes! I know. People love me! I know. [Man] Yo! Where's Urkel?! I did that too. Yeah, I know! [laughs] [Latin band playing] [laughs] Come on. [gasps] Paul! Hi! Oh, Livvy! Hi! All right, see you.

I was thinking we haven't seen each other for a long time and it's time we caught up. Yeah. That'd be great. Yeah. I've got a girlfriend coming to visit from home, Ella, in a couple of weeks. I thought that'd be a great time. Yeah. You know, I was just saying that he needs a woman. Perfect! So, um, what are you two guys doing next Tuesday night? Tuesday? Um... Yeah, I'm doing this charity thingy at my neighbor's school and it's gonna be a lot of fun. You should come. Oh. Yeah. John said he might come along, sing a couple of songs with me from Grease. And there's gonna be, like, face painting and art stalls and a barbie. You'll fit right in. Oh. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh! Tuesday. Yeah, well, see, Tuesday, I've got, um...

That's great. You can come. Perfect. But look. Here's a flyer. It's all about helping kids who can't help themselves. Oh. I think it'll be great you can go. After all of the bad press, being seen at some charity event is exactly what you need. Thanks. And, uh, maybe afterwards, we can take a selfie and remind the world how much we love you. Oh, yeah.

[cameras click] [growls] [Boys yell, punch] Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan tried to strangle a child today when what was seemingly a child's innocent request for a photo enraged the obviously troubled star. [Hogan] Oh! You little mongrel! [groans] I'll rip your little head off! [Newsreader] Several onlookers, including Dorothy Springborg from Delaware, were almost caught up in the brawl. It was disgusting. These were innocent children, for heck's sake! Um... oh, well, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I... don't even feel like I know you anymore. I can't even look at you! I know.

Paul, I am trying to get out of this with a teeny-tiny amount of dignity. [Hogan chuckles] Okay, what time is it in London right now? Uh, no. Don't call the palace. Don't cancel the knighthood. I promised Lucy. Okay, fine. Fine. I'm just... I'm amazed that the media hasn't picked up on this story yet. And thank God she's okay. This woman, this, um, Sister... Mary Murphy. Mary Murphy. And do you know why the media hasn't picked up on the story yet? Because I have been up since 2am calling every contact I know. I... Are you even listening to me? Yeah. Yeah, sure. What are you... Hey! I have been up all night calling in favors, a lot of which I am really not proud of, all so they wouldn't run this story! Oh, yeah. Look, I appreciate that too. But I was thinking, um, why don't you try and get me on some of the tonight shows? What? No! No. Forget the tonight shows. They're not interested. And, Paul, why do you want to draw more attention to yourself? Okay, I'll tell you what. I will hold off on calling the palace if you agree to have lunch with someone who is willing to get you off the front pages. Who? A decent, respectable, dignified man. Oh. Some actor. No, an acrobat. Yes, an actor! Look, I don't want to have lunch with some actor. I don't have lunch with anybody. Well, if you don't want me to cancel the knighthood, you're going. I mean, he's willing to sit down with you and spend time to explain what it's like to be respectful and... and someone... who... You're on TV right now, aren't you? How bad is it? Uh... Yeah, Okay, so, where am I gonna have lunch with this guy? Oh, God. [jazz piano playing] Paul! Oh. Chevy. Ah. Oh. This is, uh, pretty nice. Oh, yeah. Nice atmosphere, great food. Can I take... Oh, my goodness! Oh! Lovely to meet you. Oh! [giggles] I just have to say, watching you perform on Saturday Night Live made me want to become a comedian. [giggles] Oh. How's that working out for you? Well, I'm working here as a waitress, so... not so great. Well, it takes intense training. But still, um... can I please buy you a drink on the house? Oh, that'd be lovely. How about a glass, um... Brown Brothers SMC? Oh, I love it. I love it. Paul, would you... Yeah, I'll... I'll have the same, thanks. You are aware that is $40 a glass? Sure. You... do know who this is? Yep. Wow. You've really been through the wars, haven't you? [Chevy laughs] Nah, it's fine. It's just, my manager... People ask me constantly, how is it that I'm so loved and adored? And, you know, it's actually quite easy. How? Just win an Oscar. Ah. Wh... what did you win an Oscar for? Caddyshack. First one. Uh-huh. Yeah. You win one of those suckers, you can do just about anything. Really? [plate smashes] Huh. Are you okay, Mr. Chase? Yes. You need to have these fixed. It just slid right off the table. Certainly. I'll talk to the owner about... gluing them on. Um, listen. I was nominated for an Academy Award once. Really? What for? Couldn't have been acting. No offense. It was for writing. Best Screenplay. Writing! Wow. I didn't know that was still a category. What's next, Best Catering? [chuckles] Ooh! Excuse me, Mr. Chase. I am so sorry to interrupt you, but I just have to say, you were hilarious in The Three Amigos. Whoa! Blew me away. Oh, and European Vacation? You are an amazing man! Oh, come on, now. You're being silly. [giggles] We're all just human beings. I'm exactly like you. Except for the Oscar. You have an Oscar? Maybe. Mm-hm. She's cute. Yeah. Chevy! Are we still on for badminton? Absolutely. And, Paul. How are you? Oh. I'm good. Great. We've actually been meaning to call. We've had a good think, and whilst we know you're not keen, if you'd just put on the hat one last time, we have a killer idea. Oh. [Barry] Dundee is angry. Why is he angry? Wait for it... His wife, Sue, is dead. Dead? Eaten by a crocodile. You want revenge. You enlist the help of a gorgeous young park ranger and boom! New love interest. Sounds great. Sounds great. You want to know who plays the gorgeous park ranger? Rachel McAdams! Wow! As the love interest. [Hogan] Rachel McAdams? [chuckles] No. Oh, come on. You don't like Rachel McAdams? I love Rachel McAdams. She's great. Okay? I'm bloody 80. She's, what, 30? He does have a point. He's right. She's too old. No, that's not what I'm... Do you have the list for High School Musical? Yep. Selena Gomez! Emma Watson. Abigail Breslin! Yes! [laughs] No! No! You know something? You're actually being very, very difficult. Oh. He does have a point. Mr. Chase. Paul. Yeah. [chuckles] Oh. So, yeah, thanks, Chevy. Oh, look at the time. Um... Yeah, I've got to leave, Chevy. I've got an appointment. Oh, really? Uh... Check, please. Here. I'll fix it. No, don't be silly. Put that away. I've got this. Are you sure? Of course. My pleasure. With everything you have going on, it's the least I can do. Yeah. Thanks. Good to see you. Thanks. Uh, excuse me? Was that Chevy Chase? Yep. [giggles] He's lovely! Uh, is he lovely? Oh, yeah, he's... he's, uh, very nice. Yeah. [Woman] I knew he would be. Yep. [sighs] I love that guy. National Lampoon's Vacation. Fantastic. [Man] Oi! He didn't pay for his wine! [squeals] [Hogan groans] [Ryan on TV]: And that's all from me, Ryan Elcar, and the team here at LA Local.

[Man on TV]: Oh, yeah, I heard. All right, look. When I first heard about the snake incident, I was pretty upset, 'cause I thought Paul Hogan was already dead. He's been away so... I have to go on stage every time and, "Is that a knife? Is this not a knife? "Is that a microphone?" [Man] When asked about their close friendship, the Oscar-winner Gary Oldman denied ever meeting the troubled star... Am I allowed to say "[bleep]-wit"? He's a [bleep... [Woman] Though, John Travolta refused to discuss Mr. Hogan. No. No. That's a very dangerous thing. [Woman] However, he released a statement: "I don't care what he does, "but the moment he stands on stage with my Olivia "and tries to destroy our legacy, he's gone too far." Hey. When did you learn to play guitar? A couple of weeks ago. Course. [chuckles] You should come out. We're gonna have a barbie, play some more tunes. Okay. Oh, I've got a Spanish lesson at 8. Make sure I don't forget, all right? You're learning to speak Spanish? No. Lo estoy enseñando. I'm not. I'm teaching it. [laughs] Of course you are. [laughs] TV: ..the little support Paul Hogan did once have has disappeared completely. Dad, you know no-one thinks this stuff, right? I hope not. [Reporter] ...gone off the rails, right? I don't care what anyone says. I love him. This is all right, though. I know he's had a lot of criticism... Ooh. She loves you. [Both chuckle] [Chase] See? You'll be right. You know, when I was a kid, I used to hide under the blankets when he wrestled those crocodiles and snakes. And what about Bindi and Paul? I mean... [Reporter] No... No, you're talking about Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter. Who did you ask about? [Reporter] Crocodile Dundee. Paul Hogan. Oh, him. Yeah, he's a dickhead. [Man] All right, all right, let me tell you what I think about Mr. Paul Hogan... [Lucy] Grandpa, have you ever had anyone not like you? [chuckles] Uh, oh, yeah, maybe one or two people. What did you do? Well, nothing. You can't force people to like you, love. Yeah, I mean, when I started on television, one of my aunties was saying to me, "Ooh, you shouldn't say that on television," or, "You shouldn't do this," or, "You shouldn't look like that. "People won't like you." But, you know, some people will like you, some won't. It's... You just be yourself. You mean I shouldn't let people know you're my grandpa because you've been upsetting them forever? [chuckles] Uh... Yeah, oh, well, it's probably the safest thing just not to mention me. [chuckles] Listen, your mum said the new school's a bit tough for you. Yeah. Oh, well, look, it's not easy when you go to a new school, but you'll be fine. Yeah. Listen. I'm sorry if any of the stuff that's been reported about me makes it, uh... a bit hard for you, but, you know, just don't worry about it. You know, they make stuff up. That's not what Mum says! [giggles] Oh, well... uh, Mum gets confused sometimes. But don't worry, Grandpa. You're getting a knighthood. That'll make up for all of it. No-one can take that away. Oh, I hope not. [chuckles] Oh, I drew this. Ooh, did you do that? Oh, you're really talented for a 19-year-old kid. [chuckles] I'm not 19, I'm 9! Oh, you can't be 9! You're too smart. Thanks. But I just wanted to show you that. [rattling outside] I'd better go. The Wizard awaits. Oh. Yeah. Uh, how's that going? How's that working out? Pretty good. I can't wait for you to watch me sometime. Oh, I'd love to see it. [rattling] Bye, Pa. Yeah. Bye, sweetie. [hangs up] Hey! I can see your foot sticking out. Come on, what are we doing? Playing hide-and-seek? [Luke] No, we're not. So, what are you doing here, mate? Well... I couldn't find Melrose. All right, let's get it over with. How much will you get for a photo of me? Oh. Like, a hundred bucks. 100 bucks? Yeah. I mean, that's if I'm lucky. Oh. What about if I took my shirt off and I'm all sweaty, you know, coming out of the gym all pumped up and... Ugh. No. Uh... 60, maybe? Sixty?! Mm-hm. [sighs] Okay. Um... What about a photo of me with Kim Kardashian? Now we're talking! That would be amazing. I could get, like, 30 grand. Maybe even more. Well, I mean, that's just for a photo of Kim, though. Are you in it too? Yeah. Then it's, like, $120. Or less. Oh! Oh, don't worry. I can crop you out of it. I got an idea, Paul. What if I, like, got photos of you and, like, a new girlfriend? No. No, it could be good. It doesn't have to be a girlfriend. Maybe, like... a lover. Forget about it. We could set that up. You know, I just met a waitress at Denny's and she was really into Australians. I was like, "Oh, I know an Australian!" All right, listen. You don't have a car, do you? Yeah, I... No, I don't. Mmm. Okay. Why? Uh... No, I'd better not. No, I promised my manager I wouldn't get into any more trouble. Oh, oh, oh! Do the opposite! Do whatever you said you wouldn't do to your manager! Do the opposite of that. Let's do it! We'll do it together! Paul, please! Please! Please! Oh... So, where are we going? We need to find stars. Yeah, you know, like George Clooney, Julia Roberts... Kim Kardashian. I, uh... I used to know where Cary Grant lived. Yeah, but, uh, I think it's better if we stick to celebrities that are still alive. Okay. Betty White? Oh... I mean, she's good. It's just... What night is it? Uh, Wednesday, I think. Oh. Well, I know where they are. Yeah? [accelerates] [siren chirps] Oh. [siren chirps] Crap! Oh. Well, don't panic. It's just the police. Yeah, but they've got big guns. Yeah, but if you don't do anything stupid, they're fine. [Luke] What are you doing? Just, uh... I'm just waiting for them to... ...get, uh... ...out of the car. Right! [tires squeal] [engine roars] [siren wailing] [horn honks] Oh, I forgot. Do you guys want mints or water or anything? Uh... no, fine for now, John. What?! No! [tires squeal] Listen, you gotta... you gotta pull over, talk to them! Uh, no, no. I can't. I don't have my driver's license. Well, then just tell them you left it at home! No, I don't have a driving license. Come to think of it, I don't even know whose car this is. What?! Come on! John! Get your camera out. Why, so I can photograph my own death?! No, 'cause just round this corner, there's gonna be a mother lode of celebrities. Oh! Let's tap it. Let's tap! Stephanie. Tell us about your latest role. She's a hard-nosed FBI agent that needs a lot of people killed. Oh. How fun. Yes. [chuckles] Yeah. [tires squeal] No, no, no, no, no, no...! Arggh! No! Uh, there seems to be some kind of disturbance happening. Oh, this chase is getting out of control. Police are advising drivers to avoid San Vicente Boulevard. I never get tired of searchlights. Right, Luke, stay alert. Kim Kardashian, two o'clock. Can you slow down a bit? I'm afraid that won't be possible. Oh, look. Brad Pitt. Hey! Did you get him? No. I nearly did. Yeah, we noticed. [horn honks] [Man screams] Uh-oh. What was that? I think it was Harvey Weinstein. Mmm. Good. [tires screech] [Luke] Shit! [engine revs] [Reporter] And whilst I can't make out who's driving, that is certainly Paul Hogan in the passenger seat. Well, drivers are now in a panic. The chase has moved to the other side of the road. [cackles] [tires squeal] [engine idles] Thanks, guys! Don't forget to rate me. Five stars. [John cackles] Hey, where's he going?! [Hogan] Quick. Inside. Hey, do you really think that was Kim Kardashian?! Just get inside the...! Oh! Your place is gorgeous! Come here! You've got three garages?! You've got three cars? Or is it just storage? Oh, a tennis court! [helicopter whirs] That's awesome! I played tennis in high school. I'm actually pretty good for my size. Oh, look at the size of these doors! Get in, get in! [sirens approaching] Whoa! Look at this place! You've got chairs. A coffee table. A huge dining table. You've got, like, eight pillows. [Hogan] Look at that. What's that wind? Oh, you've got a pool! You've got a TV! [helicopter roars outside] [Reporter on TV]: ...the speed of the chase. [Woman] It was disgusting, for heck's sake! Oh, man! Police are advising drivers to avoid San Vicente Boulevard. The car has now been abandoned in a residential area. LA people are so nuts! [helicopter roars] Paul, get in here! You gotta check out the news! Is that... Yes, sadly, I believe that is disgraced movie star Paul Hogan. In what can only be described as a desperate cry for help, it would appear the fallen icon is now desperately trying to relive his glory days. [Luke] Paul! Paul! Whoa! This may be the saddest thing this jaded old journalist has ever seen. Paul! Paul! Paul, you're on the news! Look! It appears a lady has run from the house, trying to plead with the troubled Hogan. Uh... The lady is down. The lady is down. [jazzy music] You got a light, buddy? Yeah, sure, kid. There you go. And your wallet. Mickey, give him your wallet. What for? He's got a knife!

[News presenter] It is certainly the story that won't go away as disgraced racist nun-basher and former Australian legend Paul Hogan implodes before our very eyes. ...Margot Robbie and Paul Hogan becoming friends while shooting that Australian tourism commercial. We have Margot in our LA studio. Margot, I want to start by asking, have you reached out to your troubled friend at all? [door closes, running footsteps] [Man] Margot! Margot? [car drives off] Margot Robbie in... in LA, can you hear me? She's, uh, gone, chief. Margot? [shouts] Margot! [Man] ...with Hogan quickly becoming a global punchline... ...Australia, the Flipper... [speaks in Korean] ...and I can't believe he hasn't been #MeToo'd yet. When will his reign of madness end? And your old mate Paul Hogan... What's going on there? Does he need professional help? I don't know. There's not a great deal... It doesn't bear too much analysis. I mean, this is pretty silly stuff. Yeah, fair, pretty silly, but I've got to admit, I'm actually surprised by how funny he is. And he's kind of off the wall too. I mean, there's recesses in this guy's brain that are kind of pretty wild. I've got a joke for you, right? What do you call the fastest Australian in the world? [Wayne] Paul! The fastest what? Australian. Paul Ho-GUN! Oh, wait. I've got one. What does Paul say when he'd like the escort to leave? [Wayne whimpers] Carol's here! I don't know how she found me! You haven't seen me! Mate, your timing couldn't be worse! Just tell her you haven't seen me. I can't lie to Carol. She's an angel. No matter what she says, you have no idea where I am! Good luck! [doorbell rings] Shit! [sobs] Please, God! Please! Please! I beg you! Oh, bloody hell! Wait, I've got one. What do you call Paul Hogan's latest movie? I don't know. Who cares? Oh. Oh. Oh, hi, Carol. Hi, Paul. Uh, these are for you. Oh, thank you. Well, I thought it was the least that I could do with you having to put up with him and all that noise. Ah. Um, put up with what? What? With Wayne. Wayne? Where is he, Paul? Uh, who? Wayne. Wayne? Mmm. Oh. Uh, uh... haven't seen him. Really? Oh. Yeah. I... Paul, I'm gonna need you to be honest with me. Oh, of course. Yeah. Have you seen my husband? Wayne? Uh... ...n-no. Uh... Okay. Um... I'm sorry. Oh, no, that's okay. Knowing Wayne, he's probably... Sorry, sweetheart. [chuckles] New-show jitters. You know how I am. Ah. Why, you lying little... Oh, no, hey, but he told me... Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy. Don't look at me. No, you gave it away the minute you opened the door. You looked so guilty. I am very disappointed with you. [Wayne] That makes two of us. Yeah, I read the press. I was gonna leave anyway. Oh, and I'd give that robe a wash. Yes. Oh, b-b-b-b... mwah! [giggles] Bye. [Hogan] Uh... [Wayne laughs] [Reporter] One thing that is safe to say is the once loved Mr. Dundee doesn't have a friend left in the world. Got a letter from the palace. Oh. Well... I guess we both know what this says. Yeah. I think so. Oh. Dunno how I'm gonna tell Lucy, though. Yeah. Well, people are just sort of... so angry at me. I don't know what I'm gonna tell my mom. I wish my dad was here. He'd know what to do. Hey. You did a great job. You were just, uh... trying to manage a boofhead. [chuckles] Well, I was managing a boofhead. Yeah. Gonna be okay? Yeah. You know... ...I've always wanted to make something for kids. You should. Yeah. I'll find something. I wasn't really much of a manager anyway. Nope. [chicken squeaks] [phone chimes] [scoffs] [jazz band playing] Hello, Paul. Oh. I'm Ella. Oh. I'm Paul. [laughs] Hello. Hello, Ella. Hi. Oh, goodness. So, the others aren't here yet? Uh, no. [phone chimes] Ooh. Sorry. Gosh. That's me. How rude. Sorry! No, it's fine. Oh, it's Livvy. Um... Oh. "Running late. Be there soon." Uh-huh. [clears throat] Right. Do you get the feeling this is a set-up? I'm starting to, yes. [Both chuckle] Oh, dear. Ahem. Oh, Livvy. I'll kill her. [laughs] Oh, I love your dress. Uh... it's a top. But thank you. [chuckles] Of course it's a top. Oh, my goodness. [laughs] These things are always awkward, aren't they? What? Dates. Actually, I wouldn't know. I haven't been on a date since man walked on the moon. [laughs] Half a century ago. [laughs] Goodness. If you took you another half-century to go on a date, it must have been a bad one. It was pretty bad, actually. [laughs] Well, anyway... I'm... I'm glad you're here. I'm glad too. [plate smashes] Oh, my goodness! I think that's Chevy Chase. [Chevy] Just slid right off the table. Course it's him. He's pretty good. He won an Academy Award. Oh, really? Oh. [Chevy] You need to have these fixed. I didn't know that. Good evening. Could I interest you in our wine list this evening? Oh, y-yes, please. Certainly, sir. Thank you. Um... is it okay if I make a tiny little confession? Yeah. I... may not be an innocent bystander in all of this. I might... have had a conversation with Olivia beforehand. Oh. Yeah, I'll be having a little chat to Olivia. [both chuckle] [Woman] He's got my keys! Stop him! Somebody stop him! Oh. A-are you okay? Yeah. Uh, back in a sec. [heroic music] Over there! Stop him! Somebody stop him! It's the Phantom Valet! I know it is! Somebody stop him! [cheering and applause] I've still got it. Not bad! Like a scene from the movie itself, much loved Aussie star Paul Hogan is back and reminding us of what he is truly made of. However, the same cannot be said for another comedy icon: Chevy Chase, whose downfall has begun as he was dragged from an LA eatery for displacing condiments.
