Oh... Are you pleased with it? What kind of person is the photographer Haruma Suzuki? He's one of the most popular photographers in our gallery. I'm sure he'll be here soon. He's here every day during the exhibition. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, this is Gallery Sandor. So you came to see my exhibition? Thank you. I'm Suzuki. Shall I change the camera? Just a little more left... Yeah. Up here. Okay, this way. Nice... - That's splendid. - Splendid. I've got an interview request from "Fine Art of Photography" (magazine), what do we do? That's great. I'm not good at interviews. Excuse me. He's so stubborn. "Fine Art of Photography" asked him for an interview but he's not going to do it. Are you going to continue this series? Yes... Your picture touches my heart. Heartbreak? It's more like a scar. It's like a lost memory of pain, if you will. Yes, this is Gallery Sandor. This is Suzuki. So what kind of pictures am I taking? Next Monday, 1:00 pm. Okay. A job offer? Kind of. A photo shoot for a fashion magazine? No, black and white film. She wants me to take some pictures of her, like a solo show. That's great, Haruma. She must have seen the photos from your exhibition, and she liked them. It's nice to know that more people understand Haruma's photography... What? I'm feeling lonely. Natsuki... The other day, someone was looking at Haruma's picture intently. A beautiful woman. I was so happy I called out to her. And then that person stood in front of Haruma's picture. I kept my eyes closed. Are you the person who asked me to shoot? Where are you going? Why use black-and-white film? The smell of paint brings back memories. Reminds me of my high school art class. Is this a studio? You're not answering any of my questions. Promise me two things... Promise? No questions, please. I'll take the film. Please keep those two things in mind. What do you mean? So what should I shoot? Take the pictures here, please. You just asked me to take a picture of you. I don't know how to shoot. I was attracted by your photo. I wanted you to take my photo. What attracted you to my photos? Huh. Another question. I felt like I was running out of time. Time is running out? Give me the film. Can you develop the film yourself? I'm not supposed to ask questions. We met at the gallery before, right? You're that woman I passed on the stairs, right? I just need you to tell me one thing. I mean what you said about running out of time to take pictures. When I look at your photos... time disappears... I heard a faint sound in the silence. What kind of sound? What's going on? Excuse me... there's a bus stop up ahead. From there, you can take the bus to the station. Are you sure you're okay? Leave me alone. There's something nice about people waiting for the bus. Buses don't come on time. But they know it will come. It wasn't like they waited for a bus. I felt like they were waiting to die. I'm home! Welcome back. Look what I got for you. - Let's drink. - Oh. Okay... Haruma, how was work today? Work? Yeah, I just made product shots. You said it was similar to your other work. What did you shoot? Hey, Natsuki. Hmm... What? It's nothing. Come on, say what you want to say. Natsuki, do you hear any sounds from my photos? Hmm... I can hear this sound. Turn off the lights. Mmm... no. Haruma, that's weird... Huh? Haruma! I've been crying a lot lately... When I look at the sky, when the wind blows. I cry easily. Is that so? Maybe it's because we're having a baby. What? I'm pregnant. Yes. Wait! Let me shoot my way this time. Sit here. Let's open it up a little more. Let's move the chair. There. Sit down. You're free to go. You can touch it with your fingers, even from the inside... Your own vulva. I'll open it from here. Raise your hips a little more. Yeah, okay. Move freely. Huh... Uh... next Monday, 3:00 p.m., please. Why are we shooting at dusk? The light is changing. Every moment we get closer and closer to the darkness, until finally we melt into it... You said you liked my photos. Yes, I like them. However, taking a picture is just the beginning. Anyone can push the shutter-release button. Would you mind if I printed out all I've got from you so far? I want to see what I've taken. Are you angry? I like your finger. My finger? Your finger pressing the shutter button... And I like the sound of the shutter. The sound of my life ticking away. Time passes quietly before you know it. The sound of your shutter is a sign of my time ticking away. Ouch! Ouch... Ouch... What? You're not your usual self. Excuse me. This was my mother's studio. Was your mother a painter? That half-painted picture is the last one she drew. Did she pass away? She's in the hospital. That's why I want to keep it that way. That should do it. Thank you. Why would a painter paint a self-portrait... Who is the photographer? I need to see the pictures. I want to complete it as a work of art. That's it for today. I shouldn't be paid for not taking any pictures. What's wrong, Natsuki? What's wrong? Where have you been? At the product shooting. Haruma, you stink... What? What's going on? What? Haruma, I can smell blood. What about you? Do you remember the first time you saw a woman's vulva? The last thing I want to see in my life is a woman's vulva. Have you ever wondered who it belongs to? From cave paintings to Picasso. The representation of female genitalia goes back to the root of the prehistoric painting. Sigmund Freud, the great psychoanalyst, stated that's where all humans come from. He explained that the female genitalia represent the body of the mother. Originally nostalgic because it is from my hometown... Psychology reversed the idea that had it turned into something terrible. If philosophy is the search for truth... I've always explained that it is similar to a woman's body. Men seek the truth, but women feel the truth inside themselves. What are you doing? Now I understand what Mondays are all about. I feel like I haven't seen you since... I'll call you. I had a feeling you wouldn't call me back. I don't want your money. I just want to keep shooting you. I really want to finish it for myself. You know what I'm talking about. It's the picture! Henri Maccheroni. It was definitely his photo album that started it all. He met a woman one day at a gallery in Nice. They were looking at the same picture... And the next thing you know, they're in Maccheroni's room. He photographed her vulva. You're late. You're awake. Haruma hasn't looked at me at all lately. We're together and you're not even looking at me. That's not true. It is true. I feel like I'm empty. Are you sure you're taking the right pictures? Natsuki, I found a new theme. I found a picture I wanted to take. What? What is this? Whose? She came to my exhibition and gave me a job. So this is what you meant by "just product shots"? Don't get me wrong, there's nothing going on with her. How can you film something like this when there's nothing going on? It's even more unacceptable. At first, I took pictures at her request... Now I think I want to make it for my own sake. Your work? I finally found her. She's my muse. I don't know. It's too difficult. To be honest, I don't know either. But I can feel something. I see... Let's take our shoes off. A little more. This way. I'm going for a walk. Come back a little bit. OK. I feel different. I think what's important is time. I'd like to keep shooting in the time we spend together. You're early. We didn't shoot today. Is it my fault? That's not it. Haruma said he won't be back for a while. What sounds do you hear? What? What kind of sounds can you hear from Haruma's pictures? I don't know what it is, but I just want to listen to it. It's like the sound of shutters. Can you hear it? Hey, Haruma. What? Move your finger. Do you want to photograph my vulva? Why don't you just use mine? Why don't you use mine instead of hers? Haruma. Don't stop. Haruma... I love you. Huh... Why did you become a photographer? A long time ago, I saw a picture and thought I really want to get inside of it. I wanted to live inside the picture. Okay, touch it with your finger. Open more. More. Take your hand off. All right. The pictures are gradually changing. In what way? The picture has moved away from the female genitalia. - You mean it doesn't look like genitalia? - Hmm... We may not know for sure right away. What does it look like to you? When I close my eyes, it's like you can see inside me. Why do people move away from what they are attracted to? I'm looking at the people who come to the museum. It's like the moment when someone looks at one picture and moves on to the next one. It occurred to me that maybe I'm more interested in the moments of detachment than the moments when I'm attracted to something. You mean our last cut? The sound of the shutter at the end... You can do it! Yeah, yeah. Keep going, keep going! One more time? That's right. Good, good... She'll be born soon. Soon, very soon. Soon, soon, yes, yes... She'll be born soon. Soon. Soon. She's born. Yes, yes... she's born. Congratulations! It's a girl. Girls are lively too. She's doing well. The placenta will be removed now. Yes, congratulations. Here's your baby. Cute. Let me have one. Miki, are you enjoying the drive? We're going home. Okay... What's wrong? What's wrong? Come here. What's wrong, huh? Hey, what's up? Isn't that pee? - You think so? - Yeah. Yes, Miki. Oh, sorry, sorry... just a second. Miki. She didn't pee.
