[♪] [♪] Hey, give me a hand, fellas, will you? Come over here and hold still. [METAL CREAKS] This is really caught. Loosen it up. [METAL CREAKS] Mm-hm. I can't get it off. How'd you get in that thing? I was always poppin' rivets, so I had my tailor spot-weld me. Spot-weld you. Fine thing. Ooh. Oh. Why, you... Hold that. Ow! Oh. Now I'll have to bust you out of that hardware. Bend over there. Now, hold still. Oh! Oh! Oh. Oh. Always clownin' around. Well, out of my way, will you? Bend over there. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Stand where you are. Oh, oh, I can't. Are you kiddin'? Which one of you is Cedric the Blacksmith? Not me. We're three troubadours on their way to the court of King Arthur. Troubadours? Yeah, singin', dancin', like this: A-one, a-two, a-three. STOOGES: ♪ So we stuck our little Tootsies in the water ♪ ♪ And we ducked under The waves, we did, ha, ha ♪ Oh. Oh. If you're troubadours, why the armor? SHEMP: Well, listen, sarge. Did you ever see a troubadour get hit in the kisser with a nice, ripe tomato? Look, you see a tomato coming, wham, you close the door. When the critics are all through, then you open it up again. The way we sing, sometimes they throw rocks. I can believe that. If you see Cedric the Smith, report the news to the Black Prince, and you'll be well-rewarded. He has sworn to have Cedric's head. What does he want Cedric's head for? Ain't he got one of his own? You dope. Two heads are better than one. [LAUGHS] Two head are-- Ha, ha. Ah, you idiots. They're gonna give him a haircut down to here. [GASPS] I'd hate to be in his shoes. I'd hate to be in his collar. MOE: I'd hate to be him. Yeah, but what does he want Cedric's head for? I'll tell you why: Because I dare love the fair Elaine. Are you Cedric? Yes, and it's my head that the Black Prince wants. No kidding. Are you really that way about Elaine, huh? Oh, I'm mad about her. But the king has promised her to the Black Prince. Take it easy, Cedric, old boy. Brace up. We'll help you. Won't we, boys? We can get into the palace, see? We're troubadours, see? So you stick with us-- BOTH: See? See? One for all. And every man for himself. [BONES CRUNCHING] [STOOGES GROANING] Ooh. Oh. And I gotta write a letter, fella. Look at my-- Look at my hand. Never be able to write underwater. SHEMP: That's it. That's her window up there. We'll get her out.

CEDRIC: The Black Prince. STOOGES: Whoa. Call out the guards! To arms! I heard your shout. What is it? Your Majesty. Cedric the Blacksmith was below. So he dares to come here, to the very palace. Take the princess to my room. Father. Go. [SIGHS] She'll be more easily guarded there. But, Your Majesty, where will you sleep? Here, of course. Yes, sire. This is a fine how-do-you-do. How do you do? Quiet. The signal. The coast is clear. We can't get in the palace. They must have guards all over the place. Then let's go home. Quiet. I've got an idea. One of us can climb that trellis. Yeah, one of us. Yeah, that's a swell idea. One of-- Wait a minute, fellas. Not me. Come on. No, I get dizzy. I get dizzy, kid. Go on. Get up there. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. How do I know the dame won't scream her head off when she sees me? I wouldn't blame her. We'll write her a note. Good idea. Throw some gravel up to wake her. [GRAVEL RATTLING] [GRAVEL PATTERS] Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Something threw some back at me. What are you gonna do? Hang on. [GRAVEL PATTERING] Out of the way. Ooh. [GASPS] [SCOFFS] Go on. Now, get up there. Go ahead. Do as your told-- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, why didn't you want--? Oh! Down. [BONE CRUNCHES] Look. Raise your foot up to the next step. Whoa. Look out for that. Hey, hey. Hey. What? Give him a shove. What are you lettin' him--? Psst. Hey, kiddo, are you awake? Good. Listen, babe. Me and my pals are on your side, so don't you worry your pretty little head about Cedric. The king ain't gonna push us around. No, sir. Say, how come a nice kid like you has such an old sourpuss for a pappy? He sure is a mean old galoot. Ha, ha. He's got a puss like a snapping turtle. [LAUGHING] Yeah, like a snappin' turtle with a bellyache. [LAUGHING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Oh-oh. GUARD: The guard await your orders, sire. Good. Send them in. Help! Help! [SCREAMS] Oh! Help! [SCREAMS] Help! [SCREAMING] Ah! Wait! Oh! Get him up. His Majesty. LARRY: Your Majesty. KING: Oh. Guards! Turn! Seize them! SHEMP: Whoa. Whoa. MOE: Now, wait-- Wait a minute. KING: To the dungeon with them. To the deep dungeon. STOOGES: No, no. KING: Go on. Get 'em out of here. I'll have your heads for this. It's sharp medicine, but it's a sure cure for all diseases. Maybe so, but I'll take penicillin. See you tomorrow, bright and early. LARRY: Cedric, old boy, don't let it get you down. No, just one-- Pfft! --and it's all over. Thanks. You're brave men. Aw. Tut, tut. It will be an honor to go to the block with you. STOOGES: Oh. What? You mean they're gonna give us the works too? Didn't you know? STOOGES: No. We all die together. Oh, no. I gotta get myself a cheap lawyer. And I just bought two new hats. I can't die. I haven't seen The Jolson Story. I'm gettin' out of here. I told you we're monkeys in the-- Oh. Hey, what are you doing? SHEMP: I'm thinkin' maybe there's a cellar down there. We're in the cellar. [STOOGES MUTTERING] Your dinner. Eat hearty. It's your last chance. The princess herself ordered it sent to you. Hey, look what Elaine sent us. Ah, she thinks of me. Now I can face the headsman's ax with a smile. Not me. Where's your chivalry? Well, I traded it in for a gut that-- Oh! Ow. The princess should have used more yeast in it. Shut up. [METALLIC RATTLE] You hear that? Do I hear it? It's loaded. What is it? Ah. [OBJECT THUDS] Some recipe. Quiet. Ooh. Get to work. Oh, boy. That babe sure can cook. Shut up. Ah. You get busy too. Go on. SHEMP: Here. Here. Oh. Ah. Hey, fellas. Ooh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hold that chisel. Oh. Oh. Oh. What's the matter with you? I think you loosened my teeth. Hold still. Thanks. You did it. Okay. Here. Come on. Put your head right on there. SHEMP: Okay. Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, you hurt my hand. What are you squawkin' about? Look what he did to my feather. Wait. I got a nail here. You won't lose that-- [STOOGES MUTTERING] [SOBBING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [GASPS] [SCOFFS] My dear. Still crying over that--? That horseshoer? I love him, even if he is a smith. You'll forget all about love when I marry you. Never. If you become my bride, I'll persuade the king to spare your blacksmith's life. Think well your answer. I'll be waiting. Boys, it's no use. We've been at this thing an hour and accomplished nothing. [SHEMP GROANS] Let's take a breather, then start again, maybe. Hey, there's a draft in here. No wonder. The door is open. Sure. [STOOGES GASP] GUARD: What's going on in there? LARRY: Listen. Get the key. LARRY: I got it. Go ahead. Get going. I'll put him in there. MOE: Hurry up. LARRY: We'll have you out in a minute. Help! Help! Call out the guards! LARRY: Shut up. [HAMMER CLANGS] Save yourselves, men. The guards are coming. [HAMMER CLANGS] STOOGES: Ah-ah-ah-ah. See what that guy wants. [STOOGES SQUEAL] LARRY: Whoa. Baaa! LARRY: Aaah! Aaah! [STOOGES SHOUT] [STOOGES SHOUT] [BLEATS] [BLEATS] Ah! [INAUDIBLE] [WHISPERING INAUDIBLY] [GRUNTS] Do you understand, Sir Satchel? Once Elaine and I are wed, the king must die. SATCHEL: Yes, Your Highness. You have instructed your assassins? I have. Good. Pay them handsomely. If a few hours, if they strike well, I shall be king, and you will be the richest man in all England. SHEMP: No. LARRY: Ah. Ah. Why, you-- You haberdasher. [BOTH GRUNTING] [ARMOR CLATTERING] Attaboy. Pin him with a left. Bring back the right. Whoo. What an uppercut. Oh, boy. And that's another left. [BODIES THUD] Left. Right. Oh. Come on in here. Looks like dirty work. Poor Larry. He got two of them before they got him. Maybe they gave him the big haircut already. You know: Ch-ch-ch. If we could only bring him back, I'd never hit him again. No kiddin'? Get outta-- Hey, I thought you--! Shh. Shh. Shut up and listen. You know that Black Prince character, the guy that tried to kill Cedric? Yes. Well, he's gonna kill the king. No. Yes, but we'll spoil his little racket. BOTH: How? I don't know. But we-- I got a plan. Quick, get into these steel step-ins. We're gonna make that Black Prince feel mighty blue. Away. [STOOGES MUTTER] The other way. SHEMP: I found some shinguards here. MOE: Put it away. I got a headguard... I have done as you ordered, Your Highness. When the guards hear the fanfare of the trumpets, Cedric's head will fall. Good. How do you like that? I don't. Cedric won't either. Shh. Jiggers. GUARD: The king commands your presence. SHEMP: We ain't got any presents. The stores were all closed. Ooh. Oh. MOE: Your Majesty. KING: Your names, sirs? MOE: Three restless knights. SHEMP: Our days ain't too hot either. Oh! This is my daughter, the fair Elaine. LARRY: Charmed. SHEMP: Pleasure. LARRY: Say, she's a good-looking kid. SHEMP: Must take after her mother. MOE: On her father's side. Thank you. Excuse me. SHEMP: Your Majesty. MOE: Your Majesty. It's us. Oh. Listen, Your Highness. That Black Prince character is fixing to kill your father and make himself king. Yeah, and I heard him plot that Cedric gets it in the neck when the trumpets blow. Oh! What's the matter? The trumpets will blow when the king announces the wedding. The Black Prince pulled a fast one, the rat. There's only one thing to do: See that those trumpets don't blow. [SIGHS] [BONES CRUNCHING] [STOOGES GROANING] KING: Knights and ladies, I have glad news for you. Elaine is to be wed. Quick. Let the trumpets sound. [SILENCE] Play. Play. [SILENCE] Blow those trumpets. [SILENCE] Blow! [TRUMPETS SPUTTER] [SPUTTERS] [LARRY CACKLING] Nice work. Now all we have to do is get Cedric out. Can you keep them occupied while I slip away? Why, sure. We're troubadours, ain't we? Make all the noise you can. It's a cinch. What will we do? Dance, you dunce. What do we use for music? Turn on the radio. Are you kiddin'? This is ancient times. This is an ancient radio. Oh. ANNOUNCER: Are you short of money? Are you still wearing last year's rusty old armor? Then see the Scowling Scotsman today. [BANJO MUSIC PLAYING] [RATTLING ARMOR APPROACHING] MOE: Your Majesty, wouldst like to see a right smart dance? Wouldst. [STEPHEN FOSTER'S "OLD FOLKS AT HOME" PLAYING OVER RADIO] [ARMOR RATTLING] SHEMP: Oh. Oh. LARRY & MOE: Oh. Oh. Oh. [STOOGES GRUNTING] MOE: What's the matter with you? Are you cr--? Hold that. Oh. LARRY: Wait a minute. You can't do that to him. MOE: Can't, can I? Ah! Seize them. I'll run them through, Your Majesty. ELAINE: Wait. Father. Father. These men are your loyal subjects. There are your enemies. I can prove it. Take them to the dungeon. Cedric. Oh, my darling. My daughter marry a smith? Take it easy, king. Millions of women marry Smiths every year. We'll have a wedding after all. Sound the trumpets! [TRUMPETS BRAYING] [TRUMPETS PLAYING FANFARE CLEARLY] [LAUGHS] [STOOGES SPUTTERING] [GASPS] Fruit salad. What do you know? [♪]
