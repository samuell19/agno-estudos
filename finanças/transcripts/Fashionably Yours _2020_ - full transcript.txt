(dramatic music) (upbeat music) (Lauren sighs) - [Dave] You bet I missed the morning. Here's the weather. - [Radio Announcer] Thanks, Dave. At last I can finally see there's spring in the air in Seattle. While there's still a bit of a chill out, it's looking like today is gonna warm up very nicely, with a low of 50 and a high of 60 expected by midday. So leave that winter jacket behind because we can officially say that season is over. - Ooh! (upbeat music) I don't get it, Zoe. It's been three years and I'm still getting used to this weather. It's sunny, but I'm cold. Am I layering, not layering? - Because you're from Scottsdale, Lauren. Your blood is just thinner. (chuckles) Are you ready for today? - Some people pick up a penny. I brought this. - You did not need to bring in a good luck cookie. - For my review, I hope not. But for my last shot at moving into editorial, absolutely. And I brought you guys these. - Huh, we love you. - Yes. - These won't last long. Everyone around here loves a good cookie. You're putting way too much pressure on yourself. - It's time Zoe. I gave myself three years to break in. And that doesn't include all the time I spent in New York submitting articles before this, and so far, (exhales) nothing's been published. And I'm still stuck in the closet. - A very pretty closet, managing everything we feature in the magazine, which is no small task. You're our fashion librarian! - Thank you. And it's been great but it's now or never. And since I got this job and my apartment after eating my good luck cookie, I'm just gonna do the same thing again, then walk in there, and kindly ask for the creative promotion I deserve. - Great. It's gonna be great. - Oh. This isn't good. - Mornin' Paige. - Someone made coffee on set and now-- - Don't worry, it's an easy fix. I have a duplicate. - Oh, that's not gonna work. - Why not? - Well, in that very short window trying to figure out who broke the no-food-outside-the-kitchen rule, Michael, who isn't half as level-headed a stylist as you, Zoe, has decided he would like '80s glam. Mixed with plaid. - Which is at least three seasons ago but coming back, supposedly. - Which is why he sent his assistant to figure it out. - Oh, don't worry. We got this. Come on, girls. (girls laughing) (upbeat music) - All right everybody, one, two three. - [Kids] Thundercats! - That's what I'm talking about. Okay, everybody great work today. Shane, I like the way you stayed down, moved your feet. - Thanks, coach. - All right and everybody, solid swings. But what are we gonna work on for next week? - [Kids] Striking out! - Exactly! Swinging is better than a walk, all right? - I guess if no one is claiming these, they're mine! - [Kids] No! - Hey coach, can we play the running the bases game? - Right now? - I think Coach Rob might have to go to his other job-- - But, that dedication, right there, is how we're gonna make it to the league championship so, Go! - [Kids] Yeah! - [Child] Woo hoo! - Are you sure you have time for this right now? - That's why I never over schedule my day, right, Mike? You never know what's gonna pop up, I mean look at that. You can't squash that. Can you believe that used to be us? - Man, that used to be you. I enjoyed riding the bench. - No, no, you were better than that. And you made that bench look really comfortable. Yes, that's how it was. And I just wanted to get them as much practice as possible If we're gonna do Travel League. - Are they? Did Ethan's dad get back to you about the sponsorship 'cause we can't go without one? - Not yet, but hopefully soon. Oh, come on, Shane. What's going on? Shane, what are you doing? You're supposed to be over here, playing the game. You're the one who asked us to do this. You're already playing tag. (upbeat music) (phone beeps) (inhales and exhales) - Did you just eat the cookie that was in that bag? - Yeah. Oh, sorry, yeah. This wasn't your cookie, right, I hope? - Yeah. - I thought all this was communal? - Oh, yeah, well these are. But that, that had my name on it. - Did it? (chuckles) - [Lauren] (groans) Let me look. Maybe next time, they'll probably be safer in your office. - Oh, yeah we keep the food and the fashion separate. So... - Use a sharpie? - Yeah, I could have done that, especially today, but it's usually not an issue. - Oh, I don't usually work here so there's more cookies here if you really want? - Yeah. No, it would have been that cookie or nothing. - That's very specific. (laughs) - In the future, your snack room is down the hall. - My snack room? - Yes. For all the models, the snack room would be down the hall. I bet sometimes they have cookies. - Julia's ready for you. - Who, me? - I think she's talking to me. - Okay. - Okay. Well, don't wanna take your meeting, too. (laughing) - Don't do that. Great. Bye. - Well, you've certainly put your time. A minimum, 50 hour weeks. - Yeah, and I have also been at all the weekend photo shoots. So it doesn't leave room for much else. - Well, work is paramount. That's why everyone's raving about you. Even the photographers, and they don't rave about anything. - Thank you. It's really nice to hear. - And your organizational skills are exceptional. The closet has never looked better. - It help coming from a family of accountants. - Minus your grandmother, of course. I used to read all of her pieces in McAllister's. - She just wanted women to feel confident. She was gonna follow her dreams despite anyone who told her they were impossible. - Maybe that's why she inspired so many of us. So, at this point, I can offer you a 5% raise. - Thank you, but did you happen to get a chance to look at the article I wrote? About handbag trends? - I did, I liked it. - Really? - But I didn't love it. - Oh. - Lauren, all the pieces you've submitted, they're good. They really are. But they're missing that thing. - Thing? - That strong point of view that really makes a statement. To be a fashion writer, it's a must-have. - Right, obviously. Well, I can take another pass at it? I can push it a little further. You know I'm a hard worker. - Normally, I would encourage that but we haven't made the official announcement yet, but we're gonna be making some changes. - To the magazine? - It's no secret the print world is shrinking, and Seamless has held out for as long as possible. - You're scaling back? - Going fully digital, which means creating more active, presentational content, and cutting back on copy. We're gonna be putting out a memo later today, but don't worry, nothing's gonna change for you. - Yeah, I was afraid you were going to say that. - Let me guess, not what you were hoping for? - Well, I have loved my time here. I really have. I really have but, I also know people like Paige would kill for my position so... - So there's nothing in editorial. - And I think it's time that I moved back home, to Scottsdale. - Really? - Yeah, I can work at my parents' firm. Just for now. I'm sorry. - I really wish there was more I could do for you. - Yeah, it's all good. - Actually, this might help. (Lauren chuckles) (upbeat music) My cousin owns a moving company. Best in the city. - Thanks. - I'll make sure you get a solid friends-and-family discount. - Okay, thanks. - [Janet] For the record I think you have a great point of view. - It's okay, Mom. I needed to hear it, and better now. I gave it three solid years. - I'm just surprised they found a replacement for your job and your apartment, too. - Paige still has to interview, but there's a wait list on this place so apparently getting your foot in the door is hard, getting it out is a whole lot easier. I already have a mover coming over to give an estimate. - So two weeks for both? - I think this city is trying to tell me something. It's just weird, I always thought that this is the world I was gonna be in, like Grams, surrounded by creative people, beauty, style I guess it didn't feel the same way about me. - Honey, I know you're disappointed, but we're just proud of you for trying. - Well, I'll be home soon, now. - Oh, honey, before you go, I ran into Brian Bowman and he's gonna be in Seattle for a few days. - Mom! - What? You two used to be friends. - When we were like 17. - And if I remember correctly, you had a little crush on him. - Okay, no. We're not doing this. No matchmaking. Not when I have a move and an entire career to figure out first. - Okay, I'm not gonna say another word about it. - Thank you. - Okay. I love you. - I love you, too. Bye. (phone beeps) Mom. (Lauren laughs) (gentle music) (sighs) Oh, Gramps. (knocking) Oh. Hey. - Hey. - Wait! I'm confused. - Rob Peterson. Peterson Movers. - You're Julia's cousin? - Yeah, you're looking for an estimate, right? - I could have sworn you were-- - A model. Too far a stretch. - I'm just saying. I mean you could have been. I'm not saying that. No, that's not what I'm saying. - I'm, sorry. - I'm just kidding. - Okay. - Is this it? - Right, yes. - Okay. - Come in. (laughs) Come in. (inhales) - So, all of this is going to Scottsdale, right? - That is the plan, okay. - I hope you are not moving 'cause I ate your last cookie. - Hand me my lucky cookie. - That's not a real thing, is it? - I guess we'll never know. - I mean it looks pretty straightforward. - Great. - When are you thinking? - End of the month. - Two weeks? - Mhm. - Didn't realize it was that soon. - Well, I promised my landlord I could be out so any chance that you are free on the 29th? I told them I'd be out by then so he could get the place ready for the new tenant and I'll just be finishing work. - That's tricky. - I thought you said it was pretty straight-forward. - It is, but you still have a lot of stuff, and I don't usually book two jobs on the same day. - Even when they look like this? - Wow, that's quite a system. Believe it or not, it's easier to pack a messy apartment than an organized one. - I'm not following. - Most people, you just throw it all in there. But you, you're gonna want things done in a very specific way, and I'm gonna wanna keep your system in place. Plus, things always pop up. - Not when you have a plan. I got it all worked it out, even with training a new hire, I can pack a room a day. That's four rooms, plus all these books are in the hallway ready, right here. Easiest job you'll ever take. - You realize you just jinxed yourself, right? - So that's a yes so (clicks) I was gonna write it down. - So he just gave you some numbers? Of other movers? - Yes, probably for the best. He seems a little too-- - Good looking? - What? No. - People talk. - I was gonna say relaxed. I need somebody a bit more structured. - You? No. - I'm just going to call these. - Hi. - Hi, oh! (laughing) - Shoes, belts and hats, lots of hats. And I just had my interview. - How'd it go? - They said they'd let me know soon. But first, hats? - Hats. Come. Yes, I totally understand. I didn't realize that you had to book that far in advance. Yes. Well, thanks for the tip. I will remember it next time I'm leaving Seattle. Thanks. (soft music) - Told you we would make this work. - Yeah. We nailed it. - Oh, wow that looks heavy. Can I talk to you for a sec? - Sure. Logan? - I'm happy to take five. - Look, I know you're busy but I just wanted to see if you'd quickly reconsider squeezing me in on the 29th? - Let me guess, everyone's booked? - Yes. - Look, I'm sorry but-- - I know, we discussed the whole two-move thing. - I don't wanna leave anyone hanging. Okay. You may be all packed and ready to go, but that other move rolls over, two moves doesn't leave you much of a buffer. - I think you might be underestimating yourself. - Oh, you do? - I mean either that or inefficiently packing. - Ouch. - I didn't mean it like that. It's just packing, moving, it's kind of my thing. - You do realize I'm a professional. - Mover. Meticulous organizing? - Takes time. - Okay. What if I told you I could knock two hours off a move, starting with your next one, would you consider it then? It would give you that buffer. - You wanna help me move a bachelor into his forever home? - Sure? - Tell you what, if you can knock two hours off this Saturday, I'll find a way to move you. How's that? - Deal. - Deal? Okay. (bouncy music) (up- Okay.sic) And now the fun part. A week to transition and train. - I just hope I can learn it all before you're gone. You've kind of have ut down to a science. - Please, you will. What's your brain hack? - Brain hack? - Yeah. Organization starts in the brain. So some people love apps, but I use this. It's pen to paper. If it helps, maybe I can create a manual for you? - I'm kind of a visual learner. - Okay, well, grab your camera. - Right now? - Yep. - Okay. - Okay. (Paige laughs) (camera beeps) Okay, first tip, it's a little trick I learned in elementary school, look at your shelves, books, toys, clothes, whatever, okay and throw them all on the floor. - What? - I know it sounds crazy, but it's your space, it only has to make sense to you. That was the first thing that I did, then it was a whole lot easier starting over than moving things, piece by piece. - Yeah. Okay. (phone rings) - I think it's you. - Yeah, does it say who? - Maybe Brian. - What?! Seriously? - Who's Brian? - No one, just an old friend, just that. - Do you want me to get it? - No, no. No, we're busy. Yeah, where were we? - Throwing everything onto the floor. - Great. Not yet. Hello. (gentle music) - Oh, I'm sure he'll leave a voicemail. - Yeah. Okay. (upbeat music) (sighing) - [Radio Announcer] It looks like this cool air we've been feeling all week is finally moving east. - Now the weather heats up. - [Radio Announcer] But we are looking at some light rain later this afternoon. - That's more like it. I'm sorry I'm missing yoga. - To help your mover, move someone else? - Organize my mover, more efficiently and technically, he's not my mover yet. - [Zoe] Either way, not happy. - I'll make it up to you. Sorry, I gotta go! Hey. - Hey, I thought you might need this. (Lauren laughs) - Ditto. (Rob laughs) - All right. Clock starts in five. - Aren't you freezing? (Rob laughs) - Okay. So as you can see, Dave has a lot of interests. - He certainly does. - He's getting married soon and they're moving into a new home. - Okay. Well, is all this going? - I was thinking of getting rid of this old TV, but it's such a classic. - Question. Does your fiancé share your love of the classics? - No. - Okay, Dave, this is Lauren Miller. She's-- - An Organizational Consultant. Not that you need one. - So it's for him? - No. No, I wouldn't say that, no. This is more of an experiment. - A one off. - To cut time. - Well, I like the sound of that. (laughs) And since I have no idea where we're going to put all this stuff, I'm open to suggestions. - Okay, if you really wanna prune, then you should pick three of your favorite things from each room. - Just three? - Do you know how many boxes people move, that just stay unopened for years? - It's just to start you off. They can be things that make you happy, things that have a purpose, or even just a memory. Then take a step back, look at everything you have, and ask yourself why are you keeping it. - Okay. - Okay? - I can do that. - Okay. - Man, the way you got him to part with his things like it was his idea, ha, very impressive. - Thank you. - Two hours and eight minutes under, man! I guess I'm moving you to Scottsdale? - Yes. So now if I put it in the journal, that makes it official. I'm a man of my word, so... (laughing) - Wow, I didn't even lift a box onto that truck and I'm starving. I don't know how you keep this up. - Burgers. - That's your secret? - With the works. And I'm pretty sure you've got a whole lot of packing to do so, if I were you, I'd load up. - Oh, right now? - You wanna come with me? Bobby Sox, best burgers in Seattle. - I'm not really into burgers. More soups and salad. - Clearly, you haven't been to Bobby Sox. - Okay. (Rob laughs) Come on! (cheerful music) (people murmuring) - Hey, they've got my spot, all right. - Rob! - Hey. - How's my favorite mover and shaker? - I'm good, Nick. This is Lauren. She's a new client. - Hi. - How are you? You're in good hands. Rob has moved everyone of my family at least once. The usual? - Yeah, I'm good. You? - I will have a plain burger with water. - You got it. - Okay. What? What? - I mean... - I warned you. - You're missing out. You can get a plain burger anywhere, the works here, I don't see how you're leaving? - It's kind of simple. I moved here for work, for writing, and it's not happening. - Are you sure? - Yes. Yes, I gave it a fair shot, I think. Although, you did eat my good luck cookie right before my review so technically, this one might be on you. - Okay, I didn't realize it was for that. I'm sorry. - I'm not superstitious about everything but it worked twice before. - Hey, I abused the same beat up batting glove all through college so I get it. - Good. - I mean I get why you're leaving, but... - Because you're from here? - 'Cause it's easier to change a job than an actual city. - Unless you and that city never clicked. The weather, the traffic, I had to give up my car and I loved my car. - Come on. That's not all the city has to offer. I mean what about watching fish fly at the Pike Place Market, or sunset dinners at the harbor, or just walking with no destination in mind? That's how I found this place, by the way. Don't tell me that you haven't done any of those things? - I work really long hours. - What kind of person goes to Paris and doesn't see the Eiffel Tower? - Someone who sets a hard deadline. - Okay. All right. Well, you may have been right about cutting time on that little move, but you can't be right about everything. - (laughs) I don't think that's true. what are you talking about? - You have nine days left, right? - As in the planner. - Okay. How about this? If you can't find three things you love about this city before the 29th, I'll move you for free. - What? You're crazy. - It's a serious offer. - Why would you do that? - Pride. - Pride? - Yeah, pride. And also maybe a little bit of guilt, if that lucky cookie is a real thing. - Here you go. - Enjoy. - Thanks. Thank you. Here. Enjoy. - What do you think? - Oh, this is the part where you need me to try it? - Yeah, I mean look, it's up to you. There's a free move on the line. - Fine. Watch this. - So? - It's good. (Rob laughs) I wouldn't say love, but challenge accepted. - All right. I'll take that. - I'll take that. (laughing) - So let me get this straight. Rob offered to do the whole move for free? - Yeah, it's all still very up in the air but I'm feelin' pretty good about my odds. - So, you started out by giving his client advice on packing, and ended up having a dinner date? - Oh, no, just burgers, not a date. - Right, so what would you call it? - Necessary. You burn a lot of calories moving. - Did Rob invite the rest of his crew? - No, and I know what you're gonna say. It's still not a date. - Okay, I know this should be obvious but pants, trousers, they are same thing, right? Our photographer is British so I don't really know if she wants these but she does want these, right? - Definitely the trousers. Trust me, from experience, you do not wanna go to London fashion week getting that wrong! - Okay. (phone rings) - Who's that? - Maybe Brian again? - Who's Brian? - Old friend. - Maybe old crush. - What? - Hello. - Lauren. It's Brian. - Yeah, it's been years. - Yeah. I hope your mom mentioned I'd be calling. - Are you sure you mentioned you'd be calling me? How are you? - I'm good. I'm good, I'm just here for a quick work trip, but I was wondering if maybe you wanted to meet up? In a few hours? I know it's short notice. - Oh. You mean today? Normally, but I actually have to meet with my mover after work, so... - Oh, right. I heard that might be happening. So, is it a go? - Looks like it. - Good. I mean, I hope it's good? - Yeah, yeah, I hope it'll be good to be back in Scottsdale. Dry off for a bit. Be close to family again. - Old friends? - Maybe. What about lunch tomorrow? - Yeah, that sounds good. - Okay, perfect. Let's do that, I'll text you the details. - Great. Bye. - Okay, bye. - Okay, okay, you were all work the last three years and now, all of a sudden, you have two dates? - No, not even one. - Really? Are you sure about that? - I haven't seen Brian in years, and I'm seeing Rob later at a baseball field, for some unknown and un-romantic reason. - Right, to not fall in love. - Love. - With the city? And shouldn't you be packing? - I have a lot riding on this, so I can't just not show up. - Okay. - Come on. Don't be so hard on yourself, man. You're getting there. - I don't know. I just hate that I got the last out. - Well, today. And that's okay. Trust me, it builds character. Look, I wasn't always the best on my team, I had off days, for sure, but I kept at it. - You got a scholarship. - Yeah, and you have that same potential and the drive. You just keep doing what you're doing and you'll get there. You'd be in that same spot. - Only if I get to play against the best, right? - Don't worry about them. I'm working on it. It'll happen. Okay? You good? - [Shawn] Yeah, I'm good. - Okay. I'll see you Wednesday. - Hey guys. Get out there. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey. - I was wondering why we would be meeting in a baseball field. Coach Rob. I had no idea. - Well, you know what they say. Those who can't play baseball anymore because of a shoulder injury, coach. - Is that what they say? - Yeah. It's what they say. (laughing) - Ready? - You'll also be happy to know that I tried out your little pruning tip, so I got out here a little early. (kids cheering) - Well, your team's awesome. - Yeah, yeah and full of talent and with a ton of heart, so we got to get them into Travel League. - Is that hard? - I mean the more competitive it is, the more expensive it is but we think we got a sponsor so fingers crossed. - That's good. - Okay. (claps) So, you ready? - This isn't what you wanted to show me? - Nah. - Then what? - You gotta go with me to find out. - Okay. - Did you bring an umbrella? - No, why? (upbeat music) (thundering) So we're just walking aimlessly? - Okay. So since you stopped driving, I'm sure you take a lot of cabs, right? - Yeah, pricey but efficient. - Unless you miss your opportunity along the way to connect. - (laughs) You cute. You clearly prefer walking? - I mean it depends on the season, and the neighborhood, but it's one of the perks of this place. I remember like really feeling that when I moved back-- - Wait! You left Seattle? - Yes. I wasn't gonna pass up a full ride. I played at Vanderbilt until well you know, got injuries so game over. But walking always helped. - How? - To get me out of my head. Sometimes you got to shake things off, you know. - Okay. - My ex, we met in college, then we both moved back here, when we graduated, but then she got a job in Chicago. We tried the whole long distance thing but... - It's tough. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Things didn't work out but no plans, fresh air, no destination, I'd just pick a neighborhood and walk. - (laughs) I can't imagine ending anywhere without a plan. It would be like taking a torch to that bullet journal. - Ha, ha, funny. That will never happen. - You know what? I thought we needed a better start or like a do-over. Hey, I hope you got my message. - Rob, hey. I got them right here. - Ha! I didn't want them to run out. So I know it's not your exact thing, but this is a good luck donut. - (laughs) Is that a thing? - I guess we'll find out. - It's not happening. - Enjoy. - Thank you. - So the rest is unplanned. ♪ Walk in your rainbow paradise ♪ ♪ Paradise ♪ Strawberry lipstick state of mind ♪ ♪ State of mind ♪ I get so lost inside your eyes ♪ ♪ Would you believe it ♪ You don't have to say you love me ♪ ♪ You don't have to say nothing ♪ ♪ You don't have to say you're mine, honey ♪ ♪ I'd walk through fire for you ♪ ♪ Just let me adore you ♪ Oh honey, ♪ I'd walk through fire for you ♪ ♪ Just let me adore you ♪ Like it's the only thing I'll ever do ♪ - I don't know how you can keep eating and not get full. - It's all the walking. We covered a lot of territory today. - Yeah. - I probably should head home to start packing. - I'd say you picked a pretty good place to stop. (gentle music) - Wow! I've never seen it like this before. - So, aimlessly wandering to a sunset. Are we one for three yet? I'll take that as a yes. (laughing) (upbeat music) - It was just an omission? Mom, really? - Sweetheart, I didn't think it was worth mentioning just in case Brian didn't have a chance to call you but the two of you are having lunch now so, fun, right? - I just need to get my career sorted, first. - I actually think that now is a pretty good time for you. You're in a transitional phase. In fact, it's perfect for you to diversify your portfolio. And, he lives here in Scottsdale. - (laughs) Mom! - Okay, okay. Just be open. You might be shocked how things change when you're flexible. - I'm always open. - You're organized. Those are very different. But I love you. Have fun. - Love you, bye. Life portfolio. (upbeat music) - Well, it's so good. - Hey. This is delicious. - Yeah. - I knew you'd know a great local spot in the city. - Not me, a recent friend. I'm glad you like it. - I do. - I can't believe I haven't seen you since... - Addison Park. 4th of July weekend. Eight years ago. - Really? - Yeah, I'd just moved home from college, and you were moving to New York. I think it's the first time we're both in the city together since we graduated from high school. - I can't believe you remember that. - Well, I have a really good memory. - That's why you always got As in school. - So did you. - We were both very organized. - We were. - What are you doing? - You're not making a football, are you? - Maybe. - Do you remember how many times I beat you at paper football in study hall? Just so you know, I still got it. - How many times? - Countless. - You don't remember. - I remember. - You're starting to lose. - From me. - Well, I guess it's a good thing it's not a football. - It is a good thing. Thank you. - You're welcome. Question. Have you heard of the Essex? It's supposed to be in the harbor. - Is it a restaurant? - Kinda. It's this pop up seafood spot. It's on a boat. It docks up and down the West Coast. I have this coworker, we trained in San Francisco, he said it's amazing. And it's supposed to be in Seattle. I know you're probably busy with the move, and finishing up work, but I might be able to get us a reservation if you're open to it? - Yeah. It sounds like it could be fun. - Really? - Yeah. - We'll probably not gonna get a sea food pop up on a boat by the water in Scottsdale. That's not happening. - True. - Yeah, let's do it. (laughing) - So Maybe Brian looks exactly the same? - He's grown up a bit. - Are you gonna call him that from now on? - Depends. - Is this going to be an ongoing thing? - Maybe, we're now living in the same town so maybe. I'm trying to diversify my life portfolio. - Is that your mom talking. - What do you think? (chuckles) (gentle music) (exciting music) (phone rings) - [Rob] Hello. - Hey, this is Lauren. - [Rob] Hey, what's going on? - Hi. Thanks. Hey. (taxi roars) - Hey. I told you not to get a cab. I could've dropped the boxes off to you. - Please, you're already doing me a huge favor, but if I don't get my living room done tonight, I'm gonna hate myself in the morning so... Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, the sponsor's nephew is on another team headed to Travel League so he decided to go with them. - I'm sorry. What are you gonna do? - Sponsor them myself? - Can you do that? - I gotta do something. I'm sorry, you look like you're freezing. - I'm not asking for balmy just a little warmer although balmy would be nice. - Give it a little more time. Oh, right, you don't have much of that left. - Yeah. - Okay, come on, come on. (laughs) (upbeat music) - All this yours? - It is now. - Wow. (chuckles) I got that wrong. - What? - I always thought you more like a throw-all-my-things-in-a-duffle- type guy. - Also accurate. - How did you get all this stuff? - I guess it started with one person, who just asked me to store a bunch of stuff for them until they came back and then next thing I know, other people were asking me to hold onto a thing or two, just in case they wanted it back. - Wow, it's really nice of you but it's just... - What, go ahead, you can say it. - Too much of a good thing. - Why do I feel a Dave moment coming on? - I don't think you need to pick your favorites. - Okay, good. - Yeah. I think you should get rid of it. All of it. - You mean just throw it away? - No. I've an idea. You're trying to raise money to get your team into the Travel League, right? - It'll just give them the option if they wanna go all the way. The older they get, the harder it is. - So it's now or never. So look at all this. All of the money you need, right here. - You mean sell it? - Auction it. If people are willing to finally let it go, have a silent auction. - I don't know the first thing about putting on an auction. Especially a quiet one. - Well, lucky for you, back in Scottsdale, my mom volunteered at several non-profits, and guess who was put in charge of all the auctions? - It's Tuesday. You leave in like six days. - I'm aware. What about Sunday? - You wanna take on an auction, on top of everything else? How's your plan going? For packing? - I'm not worried. Have you seen my bullet journal? - This is a lot. You said it yourself. - Yeah, and it's kind of my thing. - Are we really doing this? - As long as you have my boxes. - Yeah, I got it. - Seriously, I can just take a cab. - Yeah, I know you can. But I was headed out anyway. I just have one stop along the way, if that's okay? - Sure. - This way. - What did you say you had to do here again? - Just something quick but it's time sensitive so... - Okay. The Botanical Gardens? - [Rob] Yep. - Right now? - Yeah. - You said you wanted balmy, right? (jingling music) - We're going in? - Yep. - Wow. - Warm and humid, year round. - I can't believe your boy, Mike, whoever that is, could get us in here. - Yeah, childhood friend, assistant coach, and head of the Parks Department. - Okay. - Is there anyone you don't know? - It may seem like a big city but it's really more like a small town. - Oh, I love these. I've been meaning to get one. They create such cool shadows in the sunrise. - You really are creative to the core. - I guess I just see things a certain way except that would make me a natural fashion writer, like my grandma, it's weird. Now that I'm letting it go, I don't know what I'm more upset about. Not making it as a writer or going home without that sense of accomplishment, that independence, that triumph I admired in my grandma. Maybe accounting was always a better path? - Accounting? That's a hard left. - It's actually what I did, right after college. It's not my passion but it's stable, and I'm good at it, and I like working with my parents so I feel lucky. - You know what I think? I think anytime you get to follow your passion, no matter where it ends up, it's a win. It's always a win. (phone rings) You're gonna get that? - I'll just call him back. - Hello? Hello. Lauren? Lauren? - Hello. Hey. Hi Brian, hey Oh, you got the reservation? Great. Yeah. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye. My friend from Scottsdale. - Oh, wow. I'm sure they're excited to get you back. - Yeah. Maybe, I don't know. But, I am finally going to the harbor for dinner. It's some fancy seafood pop-up. - Fun? - Yup. - You wanna go the next room. - Sure, yeah. (groans) Why was I so awkward? - Mm. Maybe because you're pseudo dating two guys? - Oh, no, no. That's inaccurate. - Do you have any other ideas 'cause that's mine. - Oh, I was having fun with Rob and suddenly, okay, accidentally, I was on the phone with Brian, which should've made me happy because he's actually from Scottsdale, and we've a lot in common but I just turned around. - Because you like Rob? - No. I could not like him, it's just complicated, with the move and I'm going to this dinner. - Which will be fun. - Except I should be packing. - You can always just throw it all in one big box, last minute. I thought that might get you. Hey, it's okay. You've worked crazy hours the last three years, you deserve a little fun, so don't overthink it. - Thank you. - At some point, whether you like one or none, you'll just know. In the meantime, just enjoy it. - Thank you. What am I gonna do without you? - Cry, most likely. Just sob, continuously, until our next girls' trip. - That is accurate. - Okay. I know your closet is amazing, so I tried your shoe hack at home and, wow, what a game changer. And I didn't even have to spend a penny. Is there any chance you maybe have some tips for the kitchen? It's kind of chaotic. - How many roommates did you say you had again? - Three. Hence the chaos. - Well, I don't know about you but I once got in whisk-ticuffs with my roommate. She broke my whisk, so I took hers, then she hid my spatula. So, I attached the pegboard to the wall with whisks, spatulas, tongs, etcetera. It was easy, it was inexpensive and a total peacemaker. - Done. Is it greedy if I ask for more? - Are you open to using party hats and barbecue sticks? - Yes. - Yeah. (laughing) - The board wants to meet, Monday? I thought we had a few more months? We are excited to go fully digital. I agree. And we will have a full presentation ready for them. - How'd that sound? Confident? - You? Yeah. Always. - I didn't tell you but the board wanted to shut us down, completely. I offered to make things fully digital but it's a bit out of my wheelhouse. - Good thing you've always worked well under pressure. - With great writers and an eye for layout, but creating new content that fits the brand and feels sticky, it's not so easy. - Sticky? I'm sure you'll figure it out. - I've got 100 staff hoping so. Hey, I wanted an exciting career and I got it. - You did. - Well, if it relieves your stress, the office move is almost done. - It does. Thank you. - Good. - So, a silent auction? - How'd you hear? - Lauren does still work here. And as sweet as it is for you to hold all that stuff for everybody, I really like the idea of you decluttering. - I've called almost everyone, and got the okay to auction off their stuff. - What about Rachel? - I'm gettin' to it, but we put flyers everywhere so, fingers crossed for big numbers. - I will come out and I will stay as long as I can. It's a great idea. - Well, it wasn't mine. But Lauren's pretty awesome. - She is. It's a shame to see her go. - Okay, I'll see you then. - Okay, hang on. So you're selling everything? - Yeah. - Even this? - Yeah, I'm working on it. - Are you? - Because it's time. - Yeah, I know. - Do you know? - Yes. - Okay. - And everything else is going. Lauren just we have to organize it in a way that people wanna buy it. - She's a smart woman. - Yes, yes she is. Are you done? - No. I'm definitely not. Ha, look at this! How much for the pinball machine? - I don't know, I might be eyeing it. - How about I eye it and I give you 50 bucks, how's that sound? - How about no? - How about-- - That sounds like an opening bid to me. - I'm on the board. - Okay. I have 90 minutes before my dinner. - And I've got baseball practice tonight so... - Let's divide and conquer! I think we need to create sections, so we can do bedrooms on this end, living rooms on this end, dining rooms right here. The rooms will be pretty scarce but they will highlight our key items. And we need to figure out what is in on these mystery boxes. - That could be anything. That could be cutlery, linens, a piggy bank. - Survey says, none of the above. It is beauty! - Okay. Look at this, oh. Oh, yeah. - Okay, all right. You should buy it. Oh, yeah. Look how it frames your face. (laughs) - Thank you. - Lauren, check this out. - Oh, wow. - Yeah, that's what most people say when they see this. - Do you know if it still works? - Oh, it works. Every bulb. - Okay, we should hang it. And we know your kids are gonna dazzle out there, but we should dazzle in here. It's gonna really set the mood, and when people feel good and they are enjoying themselves, they participate. And in this case, participation means money. (Rob laughs) - Well then, we should hang it. - And what about this? - No. No. That's uh, that's all staying for now. - You really think Rachel wants all this back? - Well, I should just probably call her and ask. But all of this stuff, all this is going. (cheerful music) So you really never had dinner on the harbor? - I don't know why. I wanted to, I guess I just got preoccupied. - Well, that's easy to do. - Yeah, especially when you're super goal-oriented. It's like having blinders on. Sometimes. - Wow, I've been there before. - Yeah? - Yeah. The ultimate puzzle challenge. (laughs) I got it for my eighth birthday. I refused to leave the house until I finished it. (Lauren laughs) Yeah, that was a long few days for my parents. - See, you get me. - I do. - Yeah. - You ready? - Come on. (gentle guitar music) ♪ Play me again ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ Play me again Thank you very much. I'm gonna gonna take a quick break and I'll be back. (audience applauding) - She's good. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Let's check out out of here. Come on. - Music, bubbles, water, it doesn't get better than this. - Only if this boat could take us to a baseball game, now that. (laughing) - What? I thought you were more of a basketball fan? - How do you remember that? - Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you didn't know. I had the biggest crush. - On me? Seriously? - (laughs) Why do you think I was at every game? - I thought you liked Mark Reynolds? - Mark Reynolds thought I liked Mark Reynolds. - I guess I should have asked you out. - What? - Oh, don't pretend like you didn't know. I was always three shades of red anytime we would talk. - (laughs) Okay, clearly, I clearly did not notice that. - Well, at least I get to ask you now. - I'm sorry, I thought this was, I mean, I guess, mh. (laughing) Normally, it would have been great but now it's... - It's fine. You've got a lot going on. Don't worry. I get it. - I don't think I do. But thank you. - I got it. - Maybe just hang out when I get back? - Of course. In the meantime though, I don't know if you saw that king crab in there, but we are not getting anything like that in Scottsdale. - (chuckles) okay, let's go come on. (cheerful music) - Good job. I will see you all on Sunday. Travel League or bust. Let's go. All right. - Okay. I know I was supposed to get a burger with the works but these are pretty loaded up, and a little more appropriate for the space. - Cream cheese hotdogs, nice. (giggling) (laughing drowns speaker) - I can't believe I'm moving in five days and I just discovered these. - I'm glad you went all in. It looks like they gave you a little extra cream cheese too. - It's only because it was my first time, so... - Yeah, it seemed like it was another after your first nautical dinner with whatever his name is, uh, Brian? - I'm glad you paid attention. - It seemed like it was a little romantic? - No. - No? - I mean I guess it could have been but it wasn't. - No? - No. Dating's never been my strong suit. I've dated here and there in the past but the timing never really lines up. - Yeah, well. Maybe it'll line up once you get back home. - And what about you with, what was Rachel? Was it? I paid attention. - You know that's kinda how all this started. She asked me to hold on to a few things and then-- - Everyone caught on? - I guess. Yeah. Yeah. - We all hold onto things. You shouls ask yourself why. (gentle music) - All right. I think it's time. - Time? - To play some baseball. Look, we've got this auction coming up, we've got all these super-talented kids that are depending on this to crush it. I think it's time. - You want to play baseball? Right now? With me? - Unless you're not up for it? - Okay, are you ready? (Lauren groans) - Just warming up. (vigorous music) (groaning) - Still warming up? (ball thuds) (Lauren screams) - Yay! (laughing) - Oh, you're safe. - See? - Fine, fine, fine. But you gotta admit, you love this city. - Yeah I mean, the hot dogs and the views are pretty amazing. - So, two down one to go? - Just when I thought I had it down, the unexpected. Look at this heft, they won't slide in neatly anywhere. Do we have an overflow? - Yeah, but you don't need it. - Did you do the math? On the closet? - Mhm. - Then you've got this. - Okay, so right now we have 10% over there for our longer garments and our dresses are over there, so if we swap these two out for over there, that frees up 2% and then everything fits! - Yes! (laughing) My work here is done. - [Sam] Hi all! Julia would like to see everyone in the main lobby. - Let's go. - I'll be right there. - Okay. (gentle music) (upbeat music) (crowd murmuring) - [Woman] Pardon me, I just (laughs) - Oh, cupcakes! - Just so you know, I am still in total denial. I can't believe today is your last day. - Here, but... - We're still hanging out tonight, right? - As long as you don't mind it's work. It's a big, big warehouse and there's a lot of things that need to get tagged. - I gotta get in as much Q.T. as possible, don't I? And I like that we're hanging out with Rob. - We're friends. He's clearly not over his ex. - How do you know that? - Trust me. But, I'm glad you're coming. - Of course. - I'm gonna miss you. - No, no. Don't do it. I'm trying this new mascara and it is not waterproof so I'm not crying! Not today! (glass tinkling) - Hi everyone, sorry for the short notice. But now that the move is done, we can focus on creating exciting, digital content that speaks to our readers in a new way. (staff applauds) But first, I'm sad to say good-bye to a woman who in the last three years, has been the calm center to our daily storm. Thank you, Lauren. (staff applauds) - Thank you. - To see Lauren in action is to see a true master in the art of putting everything in its place. Unfortunately for us, she's decided her place is in her hometown of Scottsdale. We wish you the very best. Please come back and visit. Paige, you've got a lot to live up to. (laughing) For the rest of us, take the hour, look at the designs, ask questions, it's still work in progress so comments are welcome. Enjoy. (audience applauding) - And one for you. - Bye, girl. - Hi. - Thank you, that was really sweet. - All true, by the way. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm just trying to get my head around all these changes. When I was a kid, I would rip the pages out of magazines, put them up on my wall, but can't do that with digital, it's different. - You'd be amazed at how many times people watch the same content when it's good, and yours will be. - We're gonna miss you. - Will miss you, too. - Wow. - Wow! - Yeah. - This is really coming together. - Yeah. Today, storage warehouse, tomorrow a showroom, of bedrooms, living rooms and dining rooms. - Told you she's a miracle worker. - It's a bit of an overstatement but okay. - Hey, what's that? - Who's ready to play ball? - Ooh. - So you have this big auction on Sunday and then two moves the day after that? It sounds exhausting. - Yeah, the two moves thing is kind of my idea. - No, it's fine. I actually brought in a little extra help. - Oh, you did. - Yeah. - [Logan] I'm here. - I hired somebody just to be safe but Logan's team will handle your move and then I'll be over as soon as I can. But don't worry. We got everybody covered. - Thank you. - So, what about the great Seattle challenge? Have you fallen in love with the city or is poor Rob here moving you to Scottsdale for free? - Good question, Zoe. - The city has definitely surprised me, how's that? - A little vague. - But, you've still got two more days before you have to deliver your final verdict, and I still have one more thing. - One more thing? - Don't worry, it'll be after the auction and it won't take long but, if you don't love it I'll drive you to Scottsdale myself. - You don't give up, do you? - Where's the fun in that? (gentle music) - Okay, I don't wanna break up the party but I should probably get going. - Me, too. - All right. - I'm going me, too. - Hey. Hey. Thank you. I don't think I would have been able to do this without you. - Me neither. (intense music) - See you Sunday. - Well, technically, I'm only half-packed, but I have it all planned out. - I'm surprised, that's all. I mean leaving the packing to last minute, that just doesn't sound like you. - It was a crazy week between training Paige and organizing this auction-- - For Rob? The gentleman who's helping you move? - Aha. - The same Rob that you went to burgers with? The one that's been showing you around Seattle? Distracting you from packing? - As a point of pride. And because he ate my good luck cookie. Mom? Are you still there? - Honey, are you still planning on coming home? - What? Yes. I'm putting a box together as we speak. Okay? - Okay, I'm just checking. - I know you're swamped so don't worry, okay, I'll be there to help. - Ditto. - What did you say? - Half-packed, oh, that's a lot to do so. I will be there first thing in the morning. - You're flying here? Mom, you don't have to do that. You're too busy. You're too busy. - I want to do that. Besides, I was thinking about how much fun it would be to fly back together. So, I will see you tomorrow. - Thank you. - I love you. - Ditto. (gentle music) - (sighs) All right. Okay, keep an eye out for that popcorn machine it should be here any minute. - So this chandelier is not working. - It was fine just the other day. - I'm sure it's just a bulb. - Well, I checked all those. - This is not good. People are coming soon. - It's not terrible. Okay, yeah no, it's bad, I'll fix it. I got this. - (sighs) Or we could just plug it in? (laughing) Tada! - It looks like we're in business. Do you think you need anything else? - Yes! I need a description for that. - I would call it a nice couch. - Good. What about "mid-century settee"? - I'd buy that. - Hers is better. - Is there a Lauren Miller here? - I'm Lauren. - Ooh, is that the popcorn machine? - I actually have some wardrobe boxes for you. - From who? - Julia Stratton at Seamless Magazine. - What? Did you know about this? - No. - It's just a couple of pieces from last year's collection. - Or, the entire inventory. - Or that.(laughs) - I don't know what to say. - There's more coming. - [Lauren] Okay, we are so not going home to get ready, not at this rate. - It's a good thing you have a whole bunch of clothes here to choose from. - You can't wear the clothes. - Why not? - 'Cause they're for sale which is why we should definitely wear them. - Really? - Yeah It'll create a full experience. Wardrobe, rooms, a complete vision. - You don't have to ask me twice. (Paige screams) - That's awesome. - Well, you know what this means, don't you? - I'll have a whole lot more work to do? - Yeah but also a whole lot more to celebrate. Right? After the auction? - Is this your "one more thing"? - I gotta get my closing statement, right? - Rob. - I know, I know, you're moving. And I'm not trying to convince you to stay. I just want you to want to come back. (Zoe and Paige laugh) - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah great, good. It's a date. A celebration, right? - Great. (cheerful music) - Okay, I am so buying this dress. - I love it. Lauren are you gonna come out? The prty is gonna start soon. - [Lauren] I don't know, it just feels kind of fancy. - Hey, this is your ball. - [Lauren] Auction. - Either way, come out! - Come out! (giggles) (gentle music) - Wow! You look beautiful. - Thank you. You look pretty good yourself. Very model-like. - You ready to raise some money? - Yes! (gentle music) (crowd murmuring) - I guess Rob knows most of Seattle. Look at all these people. - Yeah, it's impressive. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - You're freaking out? No, I'm just standing here, quietly. - Freaking out. - I'm just not sure what I'm doing. I didn't plan for any of this. - The auction or the date? - Either. - It's a good thing. - So don't overthink it? - K, not overthinking. - I'll take it. - Okay - For now. (kids cheering) - It's all in the wrists, huh? - Hey team, Coach Rob, come on. Me and the rest of the team, we just wanna thank you for everything. We're so excited for Travel League! - Well, you all deserve it, all right? Bring it in. One, two, three-- - [Kids] Thundercats! - All right. Get back to the game. - Thank you again. - Oh, please. I was happy to donate. It's the least I could do. - It was definitely a huge surprise. - That's what Rob said. - Yeah. - Unfortunately, I can't stay. Still prepping for the big meeting tomorrow. But congrats. You did a great job in here. No surprise there. - Thank you. - Julia, can I borrow you for a second? About that painting tomorrow... - Remember that "midcentury settee"? - Yes. - Well, there was a little bidding war. You'll be happy to know that I lost the bid. - That's probably a good thing. I think so too. - Right! - I can't believe this. This is your warehouse. It looks amazing. - Hey, Rachel. - Hey. (kiss squeaks) (chuckles) Wow, you're here. I thought you said you had a work thing tonight? - Yeah, I did, but luckily it got switched to a happy hour so I could do both. I don't know how you or when you acquired all of this stuff but auctioning it is a great idea. - Well, that was all Lauren, actually. - Oh, really? Hi, I'm Rachel, Rob's friend. - Lauren, Rob's client. - Oh, did you get my text? About auctioning off my things? If it's too late, I totally get it, I just thought... - No, no, we can still do that. Yeah, right? - Yeah, yeah. Sure. If that's what you want. But I have to talk to that lady about buying this scarf, so... - Good, yeah, right, come on. (gentle music) - I love that you're doing this. - Yeah, yeah. It was all Lauren's idea but I just wanna give the kids the exposure, the experience, let them take it from there. - You look happy, Rob. - Yeah, I am. You do, too. - I'm just so sorry that it took me this long to come back for all the stuff. - I'm sorry it took me so long for me to ask you to. - It's good timing though. - Yeah. - Okay, that's the last of it so what do you say we get the stuff out there? - It's just not pretty, it's versatile. An added bonus, it doesn't take much room in the closet so it really is the perfect piece. (gentle music) - How much do you think I should bid? - You can bid whatever you want. It just depends how much you want it? (Rachel laughs) - Thank you for coming. - Ooh, big time winner over here. Big time! - You know I did never see you as a chandelier man but thank you. - Yeah, I told Kate it would give off like a romantic light in the house and support our team, she was all in. - Man, I think we did it. - I think you guys did it. You make a good team. - Hey. - Hey. Yeah, so that buffalo picture, apparently it's a tough sell. - No! - Right. Otherwise, the rest, I think we're sold out! So you ready to go celebrate? Last stop. - It's kind of late, so-- - I know it's been a long day but it's real close, walking distance even. - Okay, sure. - Okay, grab your coat. - Okay. - There. - Okay. Wow, this view. I can't believe you did all this for me, Rob. - Yeah. I also wanted to get you this. - Aw (laughs) Thank you. - Lauren, you're incredible at what you do. I mean from organizing tonight, to teaching me little packing tips. You just really bring out the best in people. - Thank you. What is this? What are we doing? - What do you mean? - With all of this, I'm moving tomorrow, and you're not over her. - Who, Rachel? - After seeing you two together, there's clearly still something. - No, we're just friends. - I mean, yeah. It might have taken me a while to get there but that's just because of how it ended. - Because the distance was too much? - Yeah. And now you wanna try again? - This is different. - How? - I don't know, it's just a feeling. - Because it's new. But after a while, it'll stop being the same thing. - You don't know that. - I know our timing is off. - If you let it be. Lauren, you can't plan for things like this. - I think I should go. (gentle music) - I know, you know Logan will have you covered tomorrow and I have got that first move, so... - So if I don't see you, thank you. - You, too. Good luck in, Scottsdale. That city is lucky to have you. - Same. (gentle music) (upbeat music) - Oh, hi, there you are. Okay, so I'm gonna drop this off at my house and I'm gonna head to Lauren's. Hey, you can come over and play with it at anytime you want, all right? - Okay, all right. I'm all set, thank you. I'm so glad you won it but we gotta get going. We've got two moves today. - Hey, are you sure you don't wanna come to Lauren's, after? - Yeah. That we got it covered. Thank you. - Okay, but you sure? - Yes. - Okay. It's just not really like you to give up so easy. - She's moving. Like it's not great timing. - But you like her, right? - Yeah. Yeah, way more than I want to. But, I've held onto things way too long before. If she wants to move, I gotta respect her choice, and just let her go, even if I don't want to. - Okay. Cool. (gentle music) - Yoo hoo! - Hey, Mom. - All right. Now I know that you're gonna say that I am crazy. - You're crazy. - But we need the food. (Lauren laughs) So I got us some salads, some sandwiches and this! - Mom! I can't believe you, thank you. - It was a little out of the way but there was no way I could have my little girl leaving Seattle without her favorite cookie, now could I? (Lauren sniffles) Oh, wait, why are you crying? - I'm not crying. - Well, you certainly don't look happy. - Watch this. - Just so you know, we'll never forget you. You've given me confidence and made me laugh along with my roommates who watched the video like nine times. They thought it was super funny, and they swear that they would use the pegboard so, thank you for everything. - I'm sorry, but if you're tight on space, you're gonna have to make some tough fashion choices. An aran wool knit is a classic but bulky. Cotton and merino will help you maximize space. And if you wanna minimize your wallet, buy cashmere. - Oh. - Yeah. - Well, at least it wasn't the cookie. (Lauren laughs) - I'm sorry. Okay. I'm good, just final stretch, almost done here. - Are you sure that you have put everything that you've got into this? - They're not hiring editorial anymore. - But so what? They certainly weren't looking to hire your grandmother, but she made it work. - Because she was a great writer. - No, because she followed her passion, which may not be yours. Sweetheart, you've got to do what comes natural for you. - I can't change things now. And I can't change it on you guys, either. - Sweetheart, your father and I will be just fine. We'll even be better knowing that you are happy. - This whole place is packed, and I actually don't have anywhere to live. - Honey, I know that you like things mh mh everything just planned out. But baby, you would be surprised how things can just shift and work out even better if you're just flexible. - You're right. (upbeat music) I need to go. - Oh wait, right now? - Yes! If I'm gonna make it happen. - Oh wait! If you're gonna make it happen, you need to change your clothes. I'm just saying. - You're right. And I know exactly what to wear. Thank you! - You're welcome. (upbeat music) (knocking) - Julia, you've got five minutes, the board members just signed in. - Right. Okay. (knocking) That didn't feel like five. - I know you only have a second. So, I get it. Changing what you've always known, what you've been working towards your whole life can feel pretty daunting. But it's also an opportunity to figure out what you want and what you're passionate about. I know that you're looking for dynamic content, and I think I have something for you. I also think I have a pretty strong point of view.
