I have a small vineyard there. Yes, that becomes wine. - "Bor"? Wino? - That's it my friend. Come on, show it, show me just a little bit... Shh! M?t?, you're an idiot! What do you want, boys? This is not for you... You can't... yet... Good luck, and happiness for you, brother-in-law. - Bye then. - Bye. I'm glad we've met. I've heard a lot about you. You should watch our performance. I can get you tickets. With pleasure. Before the high school's year opening ceremony, a few days, maybe. We don't have any performances at that time. - Oh, of course. Tell me: is it hard to be the headmaster? Well, it was meant to be... - You stayed behind! - So what? - You were always a better runner. Idiots! It's so easy for you this way... Come one by one, if you dare! Learn from this, laddie: it's not useful to encounter Legion Mortis! Just wait Menyus! You'll regret this bitterly, you dirty traitor! Just wait you bastards till I assemble my troop! Ill?s, get him! Menyus is running away! You rotten... Tie him to the tree! - What does a traitor deserve? - Death! Take it as you were executed. Don't cry my loved ones. We'll defend the heart of the country from bolshevist danger. I promise: we'll return in a better future. I assure: in safety, and good health. What will happen to our sons... I reccomend this one. - Goodbye! I recommend myself! - Goodbye. - Bye! I hope to see you again. Bye! Be kind to Jol?n, she deserves it. Don't be silly, it goes without saying. Hi Pista! Me, here, did "robot". Get it? - Come on folks, lunch is surely ready. - Hungry... Dr. ?d?m Paulik lawyer Oh no, a slip! Get lost, you stupid fool! - What does a traitor deserve? - Death! Take it as you were executed. - Let me hear it again! - Stupid fool! Don't spare him! What's happening here? G?cza fights all the time, Sir! So... you're so unruly, you're unable to control yourself. Scram to the yard immediately! Get a move on! You'll run round and round till I say enough! Keep moving! Continue! Get up! I humbly report... *! We'll cross the border tomorrow morning We'll get to foreign land. I command you to keep my orders with the utmost rigour. Understood? Yes Sir! I'm finished. I know someone at the Red Cross. He said several trucks go to Austria. We have to make use of this chance. - We'll be here for you at 6 AM. - Great! - Bye! - Are you ready? - We're not going. Have you lost your mind? Here's the opportunity - the only one! Then he won't come... Loves the Hungarian soil... I beg you M?t?, be quiet, you'll wake up the... I told you clearly: we'll stay. Listen man... pig-killing is not violence - I'll send you a postcard from overseas. - Fine. Wait! Don't move or I'll shoot! Actress, Madam, an autograph, please! - You may go. - Goodbye, thank you. My Hungarian brothers! This small nation gets worn away in a pan-Slav and pan-German mill! And there's no such forces which could successfully join battle against these. That's the cause of the misery. My Hungarian friends, I ask you: who's responsible for the 3 million peasants who live worse than animals in the stable? The mill. The mill which I refered to. I ask you, me, P?l Maksa How could we prevent being grinded into flour? Preventable, if we vote for the Hungarian Party! Sonny, what's your name? And you? Darn it! Why don't you cough it up? - Menyus G?cza. - Tell it son! - Andr?s Bodor. 35! 32! Keep that in mind people P?l Maksa offered shoes. If you vote for him, he'll keep his word! A man like this. P?l Maksa. I beg your pardon, but the kid will get big enough for a larger size! - 38 then! - That will do. Menyus! Menyus! - Cover it with a rag. - Okay. Help me out, don't be a naughty boy. Bring me some water! - Your work? - Yes. - Who helped you? - No one. Bravo! All right Menyus. Leave this here. It's in a safe place. Trust me, it would be a pity if I say so. This kid will go far in life! All right, I don't mind! We'll work out the board and lodging somehow. This was built by my grandfather. Helped him out when I was a country lad. That's right. What a nice little gingerbread house! Do you know how many of us lived here? Eight of us! You're here, at last! The table is set. Can we go in? Is the door open? - What a charming garden, father. - One tries one's best. How did the eight of you find room? It was a little bit hard. Where did you live? We were neighbours. Was it a house like this? Yes. Not anymore. It was demolished. I'll send you a postcard from overseas. You should choose, Andr?s. I'll do what you wish. I'll try to get some bread tomorrow morn. Menyus! They catched me. And M?t?? He succeeded. Oh God! Why are you sniveling? Poor M?t?. You sat at the same desk, didn't you? In elementary yes. I went to higher elem. school later. Menyus talked a lot about his childhood. He must have been a likely lad. That scar on his forehead... We jumped from this house with shabby umbrellas. Oh my God, his face... Oh... Strange. Not what I would expect of you. Why, how did you imagine me as a child? - A bookworm. You're not enraged, are you? I've heard from Menyus that you were a gang-leader. And that you were almost a family member. Yes. We were together all the time. It's so cold here... like in a cellar. What are you doin' here? I've asked about you. I tried to guess where did you sleep. There? M?t? slept there. No. We slept here. On the chimney corner and seat. Granpa from the side, to prevent us to fall down. We you index finger, Menyus raise it, and tell me: which way is the wind? There. Good. Stay behind, and not a single breathe! And how could you fit here in this narrow place? I only slept there till I was small. Come my dear! The soup gets cold. Come son. Then we lived in the attic, didn't we, Andris? Who is it? Us. You? Did you escape? To the attic, fast! Make room for Jol?n. She'd better stay here in these times. We'll go up to Budapest. I'll be a sculptor, do you get me? I'll make sculptures. Beautiful ones. I'll cut my grandfather from basalt. No. I'll make my father instead. My grandfather from stone... My mother from marble... That marble will gleam, got me? I'll cut you from white limestone. I'll sculpt the whole town! With God's big beard - and Lenin. no, I won't cut Lenin. You have to cast him from bronze. Menyus sits here, Andr?s next to Jol?n - Dear Mom! Next to Menyus - I can help Mother. Stay daughter, we'll arrange everything id?s n?ni Aunty Rosie. Here. The atmosphere is like a poem by Jean. The village rests, the golden fly is buzzing 'round between the oxen's horns. They let me bring in the French dictionary and grammar books. I see. Please! Help yourself. Polish sounds strange, too. Drop your gun! Help Menyus, dear! Gizzards too, he has always loved it. Here you are. Poor Jol?n! Even the smallest excitement can do her harm. Oh my God! Jol?n! Damp clothes? Oh, dear Jol?n... Nothing, only... Jesus Christ! God! My Jol?n... Don't moan Mom, for Chrissakes! People's store Good. Calm down! Did she fall asleep? Yes. - Where are you going? I told you... - I'm going for my pipe! Listen bro', I almost forgot: I have a packet of US tobacco in my car trunk. and two boxes of cigarettes from the US. Would you mind bringing 'em here? Tell me dear, when did you meet our Menyus? One and a half years ago. Why did you ask? Only because I'm interested since when has he been growing his beard? since I'm old, my memory falters sometimes I don't remember well that when he appeared on TV did he have a beard or not? Father! Quick! Uncle Menyus on the TV! I'd like sculptor G?cza to tell us what is the most important in his art? I think the most important thing for an artist is to have the closest possible connection with reality to feel its tiniest vibrations and pulses that later when they have been piled up and stored away should be able to express it in complete conformity. I believe that in art non-figurative tendency should not rule. Although here it looks like it has gained much ground lately. The socialist artist cannot give up truth. I think you work hard turning your ars poetica into practice. I guess we don't have to prove its success. Because the reward you received... for which one of your works? - "Track-repairer" sculpture. - Yes, for that one. Show us the duplicate! Now we see the duplicate. Only a photograph, unfortunately. What inspired this work? Before I went to college, I used to work for the railway company. I rammed in the rails along with the railwaymen. I experienced the essence of this job every day, immense physical work - Which I think like mining... - What a clown! Many thanks for the conversation. Thanks for watching. Goodbye for now! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Then let's recognize each other later, Andr?s! In the future. Let it sound! Goodbye! That's Uncle Orosz. So I already had a beard when we've met. Well, if you're old, things get muddled in your head. Daughter-in-law, tell 'em look for me... Thanks son. Here comes the battle at Don river for the umpteenth time... I'll give you a slap, you little brat! - Father! - S?rika! Is this where the spiritualist woman lives? I've been waiting for you. I don't see your husband among the dead so go home, and be patient. I'll recruit your son for the parish hall. He can be a clerk with four elementary grades. Thank you for your kindness, teacher K?ntor. But we think it's better if he stays at the M?V /H. Railway Company/. What's the world coming to... who knows. At least he keeps his work, until my husband gets home. Well... as you wish. Da, da, that's it! Esteemed circle of guests, dear celebrating family. When we greet the new member of our family on this sunny day I'd like to tell you I get such a good feeling that I could brought up children who were like Menyus G?cza, the artist with outstanding talent, and Andr?s Fodor, headmaster of a high school who is, although, by blood not a family member and his dear wife, a pretty G?cza girl, Jol?n. A great pleasure for me. There's no bigger happiness when a tutor sees that the seed which he planted, is blooming and grew into a nice leafy crown. And now, I call P?l G?cza, and to his sworn wife S?ra Koh?ri: be proud of your children, like me, the village, the country can be proud for them. Here's to the kids, the elderly, and the infant alike, Long live the G?czas! I have to go away. I have something to do. Menyus, Andr?s! I'd like you to walk with me. - We'll see each other. - Have a nice day, Mr. K?ntor! Goodbye! Thank you for coming! - Only after you. - After you. It's my home... please! Please. Pobius vocato questore, libamus inquit, iovi liberatori. The questor called him nearer, "Let's sacrifice" he said, "for Jupiter the liberator". Vocato questore ablativus absolutus. propius appears as an interpreter. Bravo son, Bravo! Be sure to know it as well for the final examination, too. For who else should we write to? Uncle Iski. Is this good:"We think about you, principle K?ntor gratefully, and"...? It's okay if you simply write "Teacher". Make yourselves comfortable. Andr?s, there's some glasses on the sideboard would you bring 'em here? What's up with D?ra, son? Did you divorce? We had a modelling tool somewhere... D?ra? Strange, that I feel like the shape is right on the tip of my finger, I could simply attach it to the material and, as if... Menyus, I take this with me. I'll go, Menyus. Don't act like you're surpised! Do you know, how did you look like yesterday when you cut that marble head? You were a bit like... like God. Your eyes. Your hands... Give me your hands... I'll marry you. Because I told you you were like God? You... Why do you need me? Well, why? I'm serious. I need you. Are you afraid? You can't fool me. You cannot! Menyus, please, leave it alone, don't start to... - D?ra, come on! - No, Menyus, no! Let me! This won't help. Would you like to leave... to leave me now, right now... D?ra, don't you love me? And who do you love? Do you remember this? - Hi. - Hi. Did Jol?n arrive? - No. Why? One can shout for you, Andr?s... I was in the caf?, and no one nowhere... Now you simply get off the tram... I shout, but you're like you neither see nor hear. - Did you meet? - Of course I did... Ok, come in! - Sorry, I forgot to say hello... - He'll be so glad for your visit. - Do we bother him? - Not at all. There's a considerable demand for a series of this figure. so it's very rewarding. No, I can't tackle with it for this money. Sure, we obligate ourselves to a fixed amount for an order, let's say, 1000 nudes, 500 cavalrymen off the top of my head. - Pardon. - Madam. Andr?s! Jol?n! What a suprise! Hi! - Hi! When did you arrive? I had something to do, so I thought Jol?n would accompany me. A little walk won't hurt. Let's celebrate! Wait, let me. Come inside! Kid? School, you know. The principal couldn't arrange it? - I think we should go. Let's just... - Ok, we'll discuss. - Take a seat. One moment... - M'am. - Goodbye. - Let's just say... - We'll talk. Goodbye. Martini. Something you've never drunk before. Menyus' purchase. Finally, the two second-hand dealer have gone away. Who? Torturing him to death. Do they pay well? I'm ready. Did you find find a seat in this mess? There's always a war-like condition in my studio when I mould plaster. What a lovely sculpture! You should really give it to me. Put down that trash! - A real one instead. - Promising it since who knows when. It will be ready once. Have a drink. Here you are. Here you have Menyh?rt G?cza's thoughts about the world! What else do you want? The world doesn't need this, the world needs 1000 copies of that little tart! Or rather that's why you get paid. So I have no right to live? Don't be angry, but I have to go to the ministry. You can drink this. Why do you have to? Some kinda competition, I'd have to be in the jury, but it won't last long. You'll stay, won't you? No way! Our train will leave at 5, we have the tickets. - Why are you in such a hurry? - You can go, do your thing. - Ok, but we didn't even talk. We'll stop by later... He's always in haste. As if he were afraid of someone. I look into the studio often to check who's here. No one besides me. Grow tall! I leave now. One thing... I brought this for you! Voila! An orange... Does such a beauty exist? I can't even remember its taste. Where did you find it, Menyus? I'm working on a portrait of an attach?'s daughter. I got some from that one. Do you work? Yeah. They'll exhibit my degree work in Kaposv?r. Really? Where? At the town council. What an ugly building. Have you heard, Andr?s? That's great. Congratulations! This is a big thing, isn't it? About this size. You clown, you! - Bye. I have to go. - When will we you come again? I don't know. Also, I'd like if you wouldn't seek after me, either. Where do you leave? - No, but I'd like you to know... - We understand. Namely that Andr?s had been imprisoned and that we... - That's okay, Menyus. Understood. Bye. For God's sake! Why are you crying? Anyone who had written your diary, you see became upset. There was a person, who said enthusiastically just this: "this is work is as deep as Solzhenitsin, simply came out of your head". How much time had you spent inside? Three years. Oh yes. So you'll do the changes you have to and everything will be fine. I can't change this. Look, you don't have to right now. Think it over. I've already done. I didn't think about how you would like it. If I were you, I'd release it, but unfortunately I recommend to wait with it, it's worth it, this won't gather dust. I tell you what, this is a great idea. By the way, I inform you on behalf of a general editor we'd gladly accept you as a contributor to our newspaper. Yeah. Good. I'll think about it. The bill, please! No, please! What's up with him? What a neat girl she was. Welcome, my son. I'm curious: can you tell me where was this wine produced? At J?zsi Vincze's yard. At last. I brought this from uncle J?zsi Vincze I told him to give me his best, he'll have a class reunion. - What's it like? - Superb! "Farewell buddies, onward, onward!" Jesus Christ! Dear me! Come here! Where? "Onward, onward... this road leads me back home. I will be a philistine, too". Let's drink! Wait a moment. Do you remember this? I protected it ever since. When I die, I'll leave it to the high school. I leave this harmonium with a nice voice to you. Its bellows draw a bit, but its pipes are good. Wait a minute. This will be yours. Do you like it? Beautiful. From the 16th century. No one knows by which master. From a town in Upper Hungary. We can't accept it, Teacher. Don't talk back! My number is up anyway. The library The library belongs to the school. It has some rare copies. So! Let's drink! I seldom have a day like this. Sure. We'd better go out to the porch. It's somewhat warmer there. My old bones are chilly, after all. How much harm did the prison affair cause you? Nothing. Freedom. Freedom. I worked for the track-repairers, man. When I left them, an old mate told me: "Then let's recognize each other later, Andr?s!" This means that I have to express myself when I work in a specific a way so that these people shall recognize me. You can't approach somebody without this demand. Excuse me for a moment. - Are you Andr?s Fodor? - Yes. Can we talk in private? Please. One moment. Come in. - Do you know L?szl? Jon?cs? - Yes, very well. That well? We're a pair of students. - Do you know his family? - Yes. They're kulaks /wealthy peasant/, aren't they? No. Do you think he's all right? Absolutely. I mean politically. I mean it that way, too. Thank you very much, comrade Fodor. It's nothing. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Sorry. Who's this? I don't know. Andr?s Fodor. Good luck for your future work. Thank you. A long time ago. I'm happy for that. We were so worried about you. But sorrow aside... Let's forget the past! Look into the future, let's drink for life, for health. I allow my guests to freely choose how much they'd like to drink! Which one of you is able to continue? "If you're able, then drink up hard, the weaker drinker should mix it with water we won't make a foolish law for drinking. How wealth or morality cause rejoice What is incentive reason for friendship"... He fell asleep. Start up the engine! - What have you done? Are you crazy? - Ignition stopped working. Sounds different, eh? What happened? Did old Iski preach? He wants to make an academian out of everyone. Every time I run into him, I can barely shake him off. He always says: "It's sin against God that you're not going to a university". Why? I'll transform this rickety monument as soon as it gets freed. I bet you: I'll earn more money in one year, than a graduate in five years. They've been here, by the way. A man and a woman to preserve this old house. "Fine" I said, "You can defend it as a fortress after two years". By that time I'll collect enough money to create a workshop next to the highway. I speak enough French to announce: "m?canicien" and "service". Come on boys, get in the car! I'll take this to try it out. Get yourself ready. We'll go out to vineyard later. Oh, I almost forgot. Take the whole thing, ok? Wait. - How's your heart, mother? - There's not much time left for me, son. How can you say something like that? You'll bury me in no time. Who do you live with, son? Let me decide, mother. Receive it with love. Thank you. - What's the matter, mother? - Nothing my son. Let's just sit on the corner seat. Tell me, what lies heavy on your heart? You could've found a more decent girl here, son. Who can cook, who keeps order. Oh dear. A divorced woman. Son, you had D?ra, what a nice woman she was. Busy, pretty, smart. Don't be worried, mother. - Would you like a coffee? - What next? I can't. The doctor forbid me with regard to my heart. What an enchanting, wee child. Only if you could see how voraciously he ate... Would you like to have a look? Let's go. - What are you smelling, Rozi? - This nice perfume. How it diffuses... We never had the chance for cosmetics. Walnut leaf, at best. True, isn't it? Or at Easter... when the wealthy young farmers sprinkled with rose-water. - Do you remember Pali Varga, Rozi? - Which the clumsy Varga? - Yes. - He was a strapping fellow. And rich, too. And what was it good for? Toiled, fighted for money. And now? Crippled. Sprinkled from a bottle two times this size. Such a long time ago. Unreal. - Won't you put some on yourself? - Garn, stop being silly, S?rika! Are you alright? Of course. We'll stay home. Why? No way, Andr?s. We can't do that to them. Right. As you wish. Things are always as you wish. Have you ever noticed it? No. You're unable to see anything other than your self-made norms. Andr?s... perhaps you don't even notice if I turn grey meanwhile. Stop that typing! Forgive me, Andr?s. You have to understand you'll burn out. You burn up everything else near you. I try to be your helper, subordinate myself to your talent, Yes, your talent which you don't utilize! Bye! What did the copy editor say? Nothing. - We can go to the vineyard. - So! Let's go! You should've left the wall white, mother! But the judge has the same, son. They could hardly give us the roller. That was sent by auntie Manci, when we plastered the house. - Nice picture. - Isn't it? I see you're still interested in art. A good sign. You are my customers, after all. If I carved you one, you'd be in tears. But I paint too. If you want. Do you know how they work in M?nchen? With devices. They scan the ignition, engine, chassis like doctors in white coats. I wrote to M?t?. I'll go out next summer for a month. People say you can't live there, only earn money. You can also earn money here. But you have to grow old for it. Suddenly, you'll take your turn. No way! It's easy for you. They knighted the Beatles members. I saw a photo. Imagine how the old fart gentlemen sneezed. What do you listen to? You can't be a headmaster or a Henry Moore all the time. Am I right? I'm 20. I already have two children. I want another next year. One will go on studying, and the other will continue my craft. This is not for us anymore, buddy. I should go swimming more. Voila! "It's no use crying, the devil take the hindmost!" Why don't you drink some? To your health! So good. It's so beautiful, buddy. What is it? I didn't even touch glasses with you. It's so hot. Cheers! - Laci, you'll get dry! - Thanks but no. I drive the "cart". Would you like one? Is it over? Andr?s... I'm sorry. Come on. * Go on! Sweet as honey. Here's the port-wine... Look here, pal! It's unlike the other. "You don't have a"... Stand at attention! I've arrived you brat! Are you laughing at your old man? You see, father-in-law of my son youth nowadays... are laughing at us... our own blood for whom we shed our own! Speak about your father with respect! Saj?di colonel general pinned the medal on me the Medal of Bravery silver medal, that's right! They don't have respect for the elderly... Don't drink that much, you had a fair drink up at home. - Me? - Yes you did. Give me that glass! Where's Andr?s, Menyus? - Brother? - What? If you'll get bored with the "cart", think about me. I'd pay off in parts. In which month are you? Me? I'm not pregnant. Get me one from M?t?, if you visit him. Give me the keys, but don't tell anyone! Jesus Christ! Hurry Up! Where are you, Krystyna? Let's go home! By foot, okay? - Most likely he's awake. - Indeed, 'cause it's not far away! - You old drunkard, you can't even walk! - Me? Look here! Draw a line, I won't diverge an inch! Eins, zwei, drei, vier... What's your problem? Nothing. What's wrong with you? You clown! Mister Fodor! Headmaster! I remember the old roads as well! Andr?s? - I won't give in anymore! - Did you hit Me!? Me!? Andris! What's wrong with you, son? It was only a game. A flower for a flower! The End.
