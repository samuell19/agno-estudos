[ Sighs ] TIMES LIKE THESE, IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE. GOOD WIFE. SUCCESSFUL, WELL-EDUCATED SON. GOOD BUSINESS. THERE'S OVER 150 YEARS... OF FAMILY HISTORY RIGHT HERE. JESSE BROUGHT NATHAN OUT HERE, AND HE BURIED HIM... RIGHT UNDER HIS FAVORITE TREE. WHY? WELL, IT WAS DURING THE CIVIL WAR. THERE WERE NO REAL LAWS... TO PROTECT ANYBODY. NORTHERN SOLDIERS, SOUTHERN SOLDIERS AND FREED SLAVES... ALL RUNNIN' AROUND, TRYIN' TO GET THEIR HANDS ON ANYTHING THEY COULD FIND. [ Earl ] JESSE TOOK NATHAN OFF THAT MANTELPIECE... RIGHT IN THAT HOUSE WE'RE IN NOW. OLD JESSE'S HEART MUST'VE BEEN BEATIN' A MILE A MINUTE... WHEN HE WAS CARRYIN' NATHAN IN THAT SACK PAST ALL THOSE PEOPLE. TO JESSE, IT WAS HIS PAST AND HIS FUTURE. JESSE STOLE HIM. NO, NO, NO, NO. HE WAS PROTECTIN' HIM. HE TOOK HIM OFF THE MANTLE, AND HE BROUGHT HIM OUT HERE AND HE BURIED HIM DEEP... RIGHT HERE UNDER THIS TREE. THEN HE TOOK OFF FOR A WHILE. BUT THINGS SETTLED DOWN, AND IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, HE CAME BACK. HE DUG NATHAN UP, HID HIM UNDER HIS BED. YOU KNOW, MAMA HIDE NATHAN AWAY TOO. SHE BEEN KEEPIN' HIM THE LAST FEW YEARS LOCKED UP AT HER CHURCH. JESSE WOULD TAKE NATHAN OUT AND TALK TO HIM. TALK TO HIM? - MM-HMM. YEAH, I GUESS HIS WIFE AND KIDS THOUGHT JESSE WAS A LITTLE BIT CRAZY, BUT THAT'S WHAT HE'D DO. HE'D TAKE NATHAN RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIS BED, AND HE'D SIT DOWN... AND HE WOULD TALK TO HIM. EVER SINCE... ANNIE GOT SICK, I'VE BEEN THINKIN' HOW I COULD GET NATHAN AND WILL... BACK DOWN HERE IN THE DELTA... SO WE COULD TALK TO NATHAN. THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHIN' YOU CAN DO, UNCLE EARL.

IT WAS A VERY CLEAN BREAK, SO BASICALLY ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS RESET THE HIP. IT'LL TAKE A FEW HOURS OF OBSERVATION TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE ANESTHESIA WEARS OFF. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW THE MINUTE THERE'S A CHANGE. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. YOU'RE WELCOME, SIR. [ Sighs ] NOW, I GUESS I BETTER GO CALL WILL. [ Sighs ] WHAT'RE YOU THINKIN' ABOUT? YOU. YOU AND AUNT ANNIE. HOW YOU ARE WITH HER. I GUESS IF IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND, HER LOOKIN' AFTER YOU, I COULD SEE IT EASIER. EVERYBODY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT WOMEN STANDIN' BY THEIR MEN, BUT... [ Scoffs ] MOST OF THE MEN I KNOW, THEY... WHEN WE WERE LITTLE, ANNIE WAS A SKINNY, SKINNY LITTLE THING. AND ALWAYS GETTIN' IN THE WAY, AND FOLLOWIN' BEHIND. THEN ONE DAY... SHE SHARED HER LUNCH WITH ME. AND SHE WASN'T SO SKINNY ANYMORE. I'VE BEEN LOOKIN' AFTER HER EVER SINCE. YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY... TO LET SOMEBODY LOOK AFTER YOU SOMETIMES. I KNEW YOU'D COME. [ Sighs ] I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE JUST GOT WORD THEY'RE GONNA CHANGE HER MEDICATION. SO IT'LL BE A WHILE BEFORE WE KNOW HOW THAT WORKS. IN THE MEANTIME, I WANT WILL TO TAKE YOU HOME. NO, I'M FINE. WHY DON'T YOU GO LAY DOWN? NOW, DON'T FIGHT ME ON THIS. YOU GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP. WILL, YOU'LL TAKE HER, WON'T YOU? WHATEVER YOU SAY, POP. ALL RIGHT.

ALL WE GOT AROUND HERE IS CHICKEN STUFF. I'LL TELL YA. IF THERE'S ANYTHING I MISS ABOUT MARIANNA, THAT IS IT. WHAT? LIKE YOU CAN'T GET A DECENT SAUSAGE IN ATLANTA. OH, YEAH, PORK SAUSAGE. BUT CHICKEN SAUSAGE... OH, NO, NO, NO. ONCE YOU HAVE ONE PORK SAUSAGE, THEY ALL START TO TASTE THE SAME. TELL YOU A LITTLE-KNOWN FACT. THE OLDER YOU GET, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR YOUR TASTE BUDS TO DISTINGUISH FLAVORS. THAT'S WHY ALL THE SPICY FOOD IS SO, UH, TRENDY NOW. SO THEY'RE TRENDY, HUH? MM-HMM. YEAH. AND WITH CHICKEN TAKIN' THE PLACE OF RED MEAT, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE EVERYBODY'S GONNA GET TIRED... OF ALL OF THAT WATERED-DOWN CHICKEN. AND THEY GONNA BE WANTIN' MORE KINDS OF SPICY CHICKEN TO EAT, HMM? I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD TELL THE WORLD ABOUT MY DADDY'S 20 FLAVORS OF CHICKEN SAUSAGE. WILL, WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT ENTREPRENEUR SAUSAGE? [ Chuckles ] [ Loretta ] I NEVER HAD ANY DREAMS BEFORE. I GUESS IT JUST ROLLED UP INTO ONE BIG ONE. [ Will ] AIN'T NOTHIN' WRONG WITH THAT. YOU KNOW, WILL, I... YOU'RE THE ONE THAT...

WHAT I'M THINKING IS THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD ALSO TALK TO THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN. YEAH, A GOOD IDEA. BUT YOU... I AIN'T GONNA TALK TO 'EM. WHY? THEY... THEY THINK I'M... YOU DON'T KNOW ME. WELL... YOU TALK BETTER THAN ME ANYWAY! "I." - YOU WHAT? - YOU TALK BETTER THAN "I." NO, YOU TALK BETTER THAN ME! THAT'S WHY I SUGGESTED YOU. AH. [ Will ] PEOPLE TODAY, THEY'RE EATING TWICE AS MUCH CHICKEN AS THEY EVER DID TEN YEARS AGO. AND THAT PLANT IS JUST AS GOOD FOR PROCESSIN' CHICKEN... INTO READY-TO-HEAT-AND-EAT AS IT IS FOR CUTTIN' IT UP. - DO YOU ALL LOVE THIS TOWN? - [ All Mumbling ] MM-HMM. - DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THIS TOWN? - [ Together ] YEAH. SURE.

AND, UH, I ALSO FOUND OUT HERE THAT YOU... NOBODY'LL DO STUFF FOR YOU. YOU GOT TO DO IT YOURSELF. [ Together ] THAT'S RIGHT. EVERYBODY SIT AROUND WANTIN' SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO STUFF FOR 'EM. YOU GOT TO DO IT FOR YOURSELF. [ Man ] FOR YOURSELF! THAT'S RIGHT! SO I'M ASKIN' YOU. CAN WE DO THIS FOR OURSELVES AND FOR OUR CHILDREN? - CAN WE DO IT? - [ Together ] YES, WE CAN. - CAN YOU DO IT? - YES, WE CAN! WE CAN DO IT! [ Mumbling Agreement ] HELL, YEAH, WE CAN DO IT! - WE CAN DO IT. - UNCLE EARL! [ Crowd Mumbling Agreement ] CAN WE DO IT? [ Earl ] MAMA'S LOOKIN' PRETTY GOOD, AIN'T SHE? [ Will ] SHE'S LOOKIN' BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. BUT I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THIS BUSINESS. NOW, NOW. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. YEAH, IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY FINDIN' A GOOD FOOD COMPANY. BUT, WE'LL KEEP OUR HOPES UP. HELL, THERE'S... I'LL DO WHAT I CAN FROM ATLANTA, THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND A GOOD LAWYER HERE IN MARIANNA. SOUNDS COMPLICATED. I GUESS THE GOOD PART IS, YOU'LL BE COMING BACK HERE MORE OFTEN, HUH?

IT WAS A LITTLE OL' BITTY, JUST DEAD GARDEN, NO BIGGER THAN A PENCIL SNAKE. [ Laughing ] OH, I'M MISSING THAT BOY! THERE AIN'T NO REASON YOU CAN'T COME DOWN AND STAY WITH US. MM. IT ISN'T ME EARL WANTS DOWN THERE. IT'S YOU. THE ONLY REASON HE WOULD WANT ME AROUND... IS SO HE CAN GET HIS HANDS ON NATHAN. WELL, I GUESS HE FEELS LIKE IF NATHAN WAS DOWN THERE, THINGS MIGHT START TO LOOK FOR THE BETTER AGAIN. HE TELL YOU TO SAY THAT? NAH. I JUST... I COULD TELL. WELL, MAYBE NATHAN NEEDED TO STAY UP HERE TO LOOK AFTER US AFTER YOUR FATHER DIED. EARL EVER STOP TO THINK ABOUT THAT? AND WHO DO YOU THINK NATHAN IS GONNA BE PASSED ALONG TO IF HE GOES BACK DOWN TO THE DELTA? HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT? OKAY. OKAY. MOM? - HMM? WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THE WHOLE STORY OF NATHAN? WELL, WHEN YOUR FATHER DIED, YOU WERE TOO YOUNG TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT. AND LATER ON, I WASN'T SURE THE TIME WAS EVER RIGHT FOR YOU TO REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS BEST TO JUST KEEP HIM SAFELY PUT AWAY... UNTIL THINGS GOT BETTER. SO, EARL TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT NATHAN. ABOUT HOW JESSE TOOK HIM FROM THE SAME FAMILY THAT KEPT HIM AS A SLAVE. NO WONDER IT MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM. BUT DID HE TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO JESSE... WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY? MM. JESSE WAS JUST A LITTLE BOY... WHEN THE WHITE SINCLAIRS FIRST CAME OVER FROM ALABAMA. AND THEY DIDN'T COME OVER WITH MUCH, JUST WITH THEIR ANIMALS AND THEIR SLAVES. AND TO GET THE LAND AND THINGS THEY NEEDED, THEY HAD TO SELL OFF A FEW OF THEIR SLAVES. JESSE WAS ONLY SIX YEARS OLD... WHEN HE LOST HIS FATHER THAT WAY. SOLD AWAY... RIGHT BEFORE HIS VERY EYES. HIS MOTHER NEVER GOT OVER IT. AND JESSE... JESSE... NEVER, NEVER EVER FORGOT IT. SO TAKIN' NATHAN WAS HIS WAY OF GETTIN' BACK AT 'EM? IN A WAY. HE TOOK THAT CANDELABRA... AND HE SET OFF, SET OFF TO FIND HIS FATHER. BUT HE DIDN'T FIND HIM, NOT EVEN A CLUE. AFTER A WHILE, HE DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO GET ON WITH THINGS. SO HE WENT HOME AND STARTED A NEW FAMILY. AND ALL HIS LIFE, HE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD... TO KEEP HIS FAMILY TOGETHER. BUT SOMETIMES... SOMETIMES THAT ISN'T EASY. I CAN APPRECIATE THAT, MAMA. WAS JESSE'S FATHER NAMED NATHAN? MM-HMM. YES. HIS NAME WAS NATHAN. AND HE WAS TRADED OFF, TRADED AWAY... FOR THIS SILVER CANDELABRA.
