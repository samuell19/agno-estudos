That's it. Everybody else is out. -Lend a hand! What's going on? Oh shit. -It's just the generators. Come on. Bunker! Hold your fire! We're coming in. Open up! Who are you? -Heydrich. Thirteenth Panzer Grenadier. Let him go! - You. Why are you here? We were ambushed. -Ambushed? It's a bit late to be asking questions, Private. Put the gun down. Watch the kid, watch the kid. The gun. I'm sorry. We were warned, you see, about enemy infiltration units. Yeah, so why did you open the door? - Was his luck. Keep your eyes out front. What happened to you again? - Ambush. Americans. Oh shit. - That's all right. How far away did this happen, the ambush? Three or four kilometers. - But the front line's supposed... to be thirty odd kilometers away. - That's what we thought. What the Yanks were doing this forward? - They're coming this way. Are they? - Maybe. How many men you got? - Just the one. You mean, that kid? - Everybody else was sent forward. They even took our supplies. -Is it like this all along... the border now? Just reserves? - Look, just get on to area command. 1 don't believe this. Kids and old men left in charge. That's what it's come to all right. Can we come in? They're ours, what's left of them. - What's your name? Linus, Sir. - Can you handle all this? lused to be on the flak unit. - Keep your gun on the trees. If you have to fire use short bursts. - Sir. They should let them know if there's any further developments. That's all. That's all? - They're coming out the trees. Krupp, Engels, Franke, Schenke. Can't see who they're dragging. -Kreuzmann. Who are you waiting for? Keep low, keep low. Move it, move it. Fire. The enemy, where are they? - Out. Just fire. Again, at one. Two o'clock. Stop firing. Stop. Go, go, go. Engels! Right guys, just keep your heads down. Come on, open up. - They're on the other side. Cover me. Open fire. Open! Close! - What happened to the others? Take a wild guess. Heydrich, who else is here? - Ebert and Baumann, Sir. Enough. Hold fire. Are you in charge here? Yes, Sir. Private Mirus, Sir. Baumann! Have you been on to area command? Yes, Sir. - And the cover fire was bloody late. Jesus, you look worse than us. Any more cover fire apart from this? - There's a machine gun nest... across the path, sir, but nobody to man it. All right. I'l talk to area command again. In the mean time if anything moves out there you shoot, instantly. Yes, sir. How long ago did you get here? - A couple of minutes before you. You got away from that crossfire quick. - We looked for you. Turn on the vents. Let me look at you. - Just get on with pampering him. How many Yanks where back at the ambush? -Who knows? Enough anyway. -I reckon two or three snipers plus a machinegun each side of the road. - More than that, man. If we hadn't have split up we could have fought it out, pushed some forward. And got ourselves killed? - It was ten or twelve men at most. And how many more coming up from behind? - What do you mean? You saw others? 1 didn't see them, no. -Then who says? Don't start, Schenke. - We pulled back! 1 didn't see anyone else. How do you think, we got out of there? So, who reckons he saw all these other Yanks? Krupp's man's out front. Irritating little bastard. -We got a siege condition. Krupp wants a rota. Three-hour shifts. Did Engels make it? -No. What is this place? - An anti tank bunker. You all right? But the situation is critical. No, we don't know how many, but... Yes. Yes. Very good, Sir. All units up at the front. No reinforcements available, we hold until relieved. - Hold with what? They don't know we're low on ammo. They haven't the element of surprise. - They don't need surprise if there's an armoured column coming. - Where's this coming from? Oh come on! We don't know what's going on up at the front. We were ambushed by an infiltration unit or an advanced pocket of resistance. What do you think about that, Baumann? -I saw them. They were there. They know we've got no covering fire. Now that it's gone there is nothing to stop them surrounding us. - So what? They won't getin unless one of you opens the door. - Ebert's right, Sir. Without ammo we can't hold them. -And I say they won't attack. Why? You saw the way they came after us, Lieutenant, they weren't just doing their job, they were trying to be heroes, so if they do get in here, they won't be taking prisoners. So. We're surrounded and we're almost out of ammunition. What options do we have exactly, Sir? There's always the tunnels. The tunnels are through the other door. - What's down there? Only rats. -I mean, what are they for? Munitions storage, I think. They were never finished. Why? -Idon't know. Too many cave-ins. They're not safe. -But you've been in? Not very far. - There's amain entrance on the other side of that hill. I seen it from the outside. - Could be ammunition stored in there? I've not been in that far. - So let's take a look. No. Our orders are to stay put. - Yes, well, if there's a... We'll hold our position here. And you're both still on watch. Make this door secure, sergeant. - Yes, sir. Let me take a quick look. - You heard the Lieutenant? Yeah, I heard. - We lost half our men today. We must stick together, right, Corporal? I'l go get something to eat. Thanks. So what about the old man? He shouldn't be here in this state. - None of us should be here. Listen. What Schenke did earlier was out of line. He's always trying to prove something. You heard what slipped out the other day how he tried to join the SS but they wouldn't have him. Not pure enough. He's geared up on Bencedrin he's doing half the time. He'll get us all killed one day. We'd know, that too long. I tell you, Iwas shit scared back there. Given half the chance I would have done the same as you. What do you mean? - You know, got out of there while I could, every man for himself. They wouldn't dig something that extensive and not put it to good use. 1told you what I know. Here have some. - Yes, and I told you I don't drink. You know more than you're letting on. - Schenke, just relax. You're not curious about those tunnels? - Forget about the tunnels. We've got enough to worry about here. Thank you. So, where did you get that? Front line. Seventeen. Shell fragment. What about you? Any war stories? Maybe something that happened to you at school? Don't worry about it. This war's not over by along way, believe me. You'll be telling stories like a veteran before you know it. 1 do know one story. I know what happened in those tunnels. -Goon. It's just something I've heard, but... there was some kind of an... uprising with the slave workers building the tunnels, the 0.T. had to stop work... Yeah, I'll tell you what happened. Just don't call me a liar. -I'm listening. The O.T. closed this site because... they didn't like it in there. Nobody likes it in there. The local folk didn't help matters. - What are you talking about? People around here have unpleasant stories about this place. He knows. - Ghost stories. 1told you that you wouldn't believe me, but you haven't been in those tunnels in the dark. Yeah, you can laugh. But tales don't last hundreds of years for no reason. Remember, these woods are ancient. Older than Germany. They used to burn witches here because the place is evil. It was during the Black Death and the Plague was sweeping across the continent. The village here was isolated, and they thought they were safe, but there was no escape. The disease started to spread through this district like wild fire. One day a stranger arrived in the village. Some said, he was a priest. If he was, he was a priest of the unholy. Perhaps he was death himself. He began to turn the villagers against one another. Friends became enemies. It didn't take long. He offered to rid them of the Plague once and for all. And the people listened to him. One shameful night... he roused the villagers into a frenzy. He led a mob, which drove the sick and infected from their homes... pursued them to these woods, hunted them down like dogs and when they were finally run to ground, they were slaughtered. Beaten, clubbed, hacked. When it was over, their poisoned bodies... were buried in a great pit. Not all of them were dead as the hole was filled in. What's the matter? -Don't worry about it, old man. He's got no stomach, that's all. Anyway if that's the best story you can come up with, then listen to this. It was on the way back from Russia, as we reached Poland, some small town... Kreuzmann! Are they still out there? - And all the way round, I should think. You mean, we're surrounded? - They're not going to try anything. But they could get in if they wanted to. - There's probably not enough of them... to try. - You know what they do to elite division troops? As far as they're concerned we're no better than a cyst. Just take it easy. Ok? There is something about this place. There is something that is not quite right. You haven't worked it out yet, have you? What's that then? - Well, with the others dead, it's just us again. It's just the seven of us. Get some rest. You're probably still concussed, go on. God with us. Goon. Come here. Whats it? Listen. Don't they ever sleep? Help me, help me. Help me, help me... No, stop, I'm begging you, please, don't, no, no, no. No, please, no, stop. No, no. Werner. I'm here, Werner. Werner! Baumann, wake up. Wake up! What's the matter? I can't find Mirus or Kreuzmann. Who's on watch? - Me, Heydrich and Franke. It's time for the shift change. - What do you mean, you can't find them? I mean, they must be in the tunnels. You up. You up. Relieve Heydrich and the gun team. What's going on? - Just do it now, please. They're deserting. - We don't know that. What do you think they're doing, huh? I want them brought back here. Take Heydrich with you. -Heydrich's injured, I'll go. Unless of course, you don't trust me to come back. Don't be too long. Jesus, it stinks down here. There's no proper ventilation. Nitrate dripping through the concrete. This place was never finished properly. I'l go this way. - What, are we splitting up? Are you scared of the dark now? - We'll cover more ground that way. Baumann. We're not going to find them. Ifound this in the access tunnel before I woke you. It's Kreuzmann's. If Krupp knew about this he'd send Schenke down after him, do you understand that? - He won't hear about it from me. Good. I'll see you back here in ten minutes, all right? What's he up to? - The old man's been wandering off for the past couple of weeks. -For what reason? 1 don't know. He's never gone for very long, an hour or so just to be by himself. He sometimes gets confused. Surely not. - Either way, we're gonna assume he's shown Kreuzmann a way out. -I don't think so, sir. Why? -I don't think Mirus would let anybody go with him, sir. He always told me to stay away from the tunnel. He treats them as if they belong to him. -Is that why he's trying to frighten us with ghost stories to try to keep us out? - Maybe. He sometimes acts as if, as if the... Asif? - As if there's something in there that he didn't want me to know about. - What? It's Kreuzmann. Mirus? Kreuzmann? Shit. What the hell's going on? -My torch, it failed. Where's Ebert? -Don't know, I couldn't move from here. It wasn't working. -No point asking if you've found Kreuzmann then? - This is huge, he could be anywhere. Besides we've got more important... -Such as? The Americans. -What in here? It's possible, sir, they could have got in from the other side of the hill. Have you seen anything? -No, but I heard something. Halt. There's your Americans. Heydrich. Right, where's Kreuzmann? You came down here together. Where is he? -I came down here on my own. I want to know, what's been going on. Well, nothing's been going on. Quiet. Gun fire. The bunker. Stay here. Watch the tunnels. There's no one there, stop firing, there's no one there. What the hell are you doing? What are you firing at? Jesus, they were everywhere, then I thought. For a minute there... Easy. Easy. They've gone now. Used up shooting at shadows. - They were out there. Then why didn't you hit anything? Look outside. Where are the bodies? I'd expect that from some schoolboy, but from you, Schenke, you should lay off them pills, they're making you see things. - Franke saw something too, Sir. They can't both be imagining. - They're playing tricks on us. They are testing our firepower. - Keep out of it, Baumann. So what do we have left? - Whatever rifle rounds and grenades each of us have. - Still some chance for the cannon. What is that, you idiot? The line's dead. - It won't be an overhead telephone line. It will be a ground cable probably routed back through the tunnels and you know what that means. - Allright. Suppose the Americans are in the tunnels. -I say, we secure the entire complex. If they're in there we push them out. - With what, Schenke? With our bare bloody hands if necessary. If they were in there in force, they would have stormed us by now. It's got to be a manageable number. You think, Kreuzmann and Ebert are dead? - Deserted or dead, we can forget them. Oh you're all heart, Schenke. - Shut your mouth. You had your chance to find them. You prefer to hide away. - If you're looking for a fight, Schenke, you'll have to try harder than that. When will you realise 1 am not fighting the same war as you? - Isn't that the truth? We can't let the enemy have the tunnels. You know something of the layout in there? Anywhere particularly suitable for the enemy to lay a trap? - The whole place is a trap. Forget him, what does he know? Whatever's in there, we can handle it. Right. If the enemy is inside, they must have got in through the back entrance. We'll find it, secure it. If we go into too much opposition, we come back here. My orders only cover this bunker. - This shall be interesting. Is that to keep them out or us in? - You catch on quick. Let me come with you into the tunnels. -No. Please. -Isaid no. I need someone I can trust back here. You did all right before, you've got some fight in you. -It's all yours, kid. Keep an eye on the old man. - Yes, Sir. We'll go straight for the back entrance. If we sweep round the wrong way. If that's all right with you, Corporal. - Give it a rest, Schenke. Don't forget Schenke, two flashes on the torch means it's us. Why doesn't he keep him under control? - Schenke has no control. Why do you let him keep riling you? - What do you want me to do? Well, you could start by telling him what really happened back at the ambush. Why? - think, you enjoy being hated. Why are you not watching the front? - You can't see anything out there. Mirus, they've left us in charge. - Look, they're the ones who brought all this down on top of us. We were doing fine till they turned up. Ifthe Americans attack, let them deal with it. I've done enough. I saw my comrades slaughtered twenty-five years ago. Look, you can't just give up now. We have to do what we can, at least warn the others of an attack. Danger's not even out there, it's in those tunnels. What are you talking? - Werner told me. Werner? -My son. Your son's dead, Mirus, he died in Normandy, you told me so yourself. Don't look at me like that. I'm telling you, he talks to me. No, he doesn't. You're just confused again. Look at me. Look at me. Your son's dead, Mirus, he's gone. You think, I'm just a crazy old man, you all do, but there's something about those tunnels. They make you see things, do things. In there, Werner comes back to me. Only tonight it was different. Tonight when he came back to me, others came back with him. Yeah. 1 don't believe it. It's all artillery ammo. - Useless to us. Let's move on. And leave it for the enemy? - We'll deal with it later, come on. Cover me. Doors are sealed. Nobody got in this way. There's someone out there. As long as they're not in here. - There must be another way we don't know about. A vent, escape shaft or something. We should wait here for the others. - They've probably already surrendered. I still haven't surrendered to suggest there's anyone in here but ourselves. Schenke. It's Ebert. Looks like he was run through. Is he dead? Christ. - Looks dead to me, Lieutenant. It's there for a reason. Could be the way out. Right, you two check it, I'l cover your backs. Something smashed through here. Jesus Christ. The Plague pit. Mirus's story. Do you think that's what's wrong with him? It can't be possible, not after all these years. That'll do you no good, you catch it from fleabites and fleas. It's Kreuzmann. -No, no, ho, ho, no. What do I do? -He's gone. He's dead. They're here, they're back, they're back. There's blood. - Yes, butit's not his. They said that killed him. - Who did they kill? You mean Engels. Come on, let's get out of here. -No, ho, no. No, no, no... They're playing games with us. They're everywhere. What are you doing? You can't leave the ammo. Too late, that can't hold them off. - The enemy's here, let's stand, fight. Then I'l do it alone. - You'll do as you're bloody told, get up. Stop. Stop. What do we do now? - Let's get him to the bunker. Don't be a fool. Whatever that duty was, it's stopped! You can't help them. There now, why don't you ever listen to me you, little idiot? Neumann. Right, then get yourself killed. For what? Werner? Werner, what's happening, hm? I tried to stop them, but they wouldn't listen to me. Sol, lL. Oh my god. Forgive me. Werner. Mirus? Mirus, open up. Werner. What the hell are you doing here? We heard shooting. I came to help. What about keeping lookout? - The rainstorm, we couldn't see a thing. Mirus is still watching the front. I thought, I'd be more help here to you. Are you ready to help? To do whatever is required? Yes. - Ready to take on the responsibilities of wearing that uniform? Yes, sir. - The do as I say, without question. Do you understand? They're in here, the enemy. They're trying to confuse us, trying to pick us off one by one. The Lieutenant's dead, the others can't be trusted, soit's up tous. We give the enemy nothing. So, what's our situation? - God knows. Either they could have gassed the tunnels, making us hallucinate, it's the only thing that makes sense. -Explains a lot. Where are the others? - Shooting stopped quicker then nothing. Perhaps they've already surrendered. - In which case there could be a platoon of Americans the other side of that door. Or they could be coming straight for us down the tunnels. Wait a minute. Ok, more wood and sacking on top, quickly. What happens to us when this goes up? -Don't worry, we won't be here, we've got other things to take care of. They're coming again. Could you hear that as well? - Yes. The Americans trying to panic us. - Ok, so what do we do now? We're gonna have to blow the bunker door. Ifthey are in there, we'll fight. We won't stand a chance. - You wanna die on your own down here? Go! That was a booby trap. They're coming in from both ends now. Are you ready? This is it. If it moves, shoot. Damnit. If anything, it's jammed tighter. Shit. - Alternative plan. Which is? -We find the other entrance. Shit. Christ, they're everywhere. We don't stand a chance. Can't see anything. - That's it. We got nothing to fight... Shut up! Franke, Wait. Enough. We surrender, don't shoot. Do you hear? -lhear. Schenke. Thank god. - Did you find a way out, Schenke? Nobodies getting out, not them or us. What's going on? - What's going on is this: Krupp's dead, so are Ebert and Kreuzmann and lacking a suitable replacement, I'm assuming command. What happened? - You three weren't at the rendezvous. Wait a minute, Schenke. - Never where you should be, Baumann, but this is the last time. Take a look, kid. This is the reason why we're losing. - They're just around the corner. The reason we've been pulling back, cowards, that won't bloody fight. We haven't got anything left to fight with. Just show us the way out. Don't worry about the Americans, I've taken care of that. But first things first, time to weed out the traitors. Don't listen to him, he's out of his mind. - Time to prove yourself, kid. They don't deserve to wear that uniform. Prove that you do. Do I have to spell it out? They're traitors and cowards, shoot them. 1 can't just kill him. That's how it's done, now do it. Go, go, go. Come back, come back. I'm coming, Baumann. In here. Come on. This won't hold him. - This way out. Baumann, we're trapped. -No, we're digging our way out. We can't see a thing. - Wait a minute. Dear god. Drop the gun, Schenke. Go on, you first. Go on. Go! Get out! Sir. Wave this. Walk straight down, don't try to hide. You'll be all right. - You're not coming? 1 don't get away with it that easily. You've been given a chance. Now do as you're told go. Go. Go, go on. Et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Jesus nunc et in hora mortis nostrae. Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum, benedicta tu in mulieribus.
