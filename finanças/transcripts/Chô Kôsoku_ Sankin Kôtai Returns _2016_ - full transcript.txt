Alright, let's run back to yunagaya! Last one home gets a half-year pay cut! One month later take care of things while I'm away. Yoshimune [okugawa 8th shogun of Japan take care of things while I'm away. Yoshimune lokugawa 8th shogun of Japan yoshimune [okugawa 8th shogun of Japan as you wish.

At this very moment! The shogun's visit to nikko was an important occasion, paying respects to leyasu tokugawa, the founder of the edo shogunate enshrined at nikko toshogu. It enhanced the shogun's prestige, and yet was long deferred due to its extravagant cost. However, the 8th shogun, yoshimune tokugawa, revived the event for the first time in 65 years. Over 130,000 men took part in the procession. The foremost group left at 2am, and the hindmost group left edo castle as late as 10am, so it is said. You would defy the shogun? No sir! You won't eat? Nobutoki matsuaaira councilor to the shogun nobutoki matsuaaira councilor to the shogun you really ate it! You really ate it! Stand down! This yokel knows nothing of governance. You wait and see! Hanamaitsu clan edo residence hanamaitsu clan eqo residence nobutoki. How have you been spending your confinement here? I have been reflecting deeply on my indiscretions. You sound resigned to your fate. Whatever order I receive, I shall obey it. Nobutoki. The shogun"s visit to nikko has led to your amnesty. Your house arrest has been lifted. I am truly grateful! As you are my nephew, the shogun took mercy on you. Do not blunder again! Turn over a new leaf, and fulfill your duty as a councilor! Iwaki, yunagaya When's our lord due back? I heard he left edo a month ago. He's taking his time. He got to edo in five days. He'll want to take it easy. Darn right. Hey! Get outta that paddy! Don't play in the fields! Those darn brats! I wonder if lord naito's gonna bring us gifts? Soma's too much of a tightwad. All we'll get is hot air. Too right! What's that? Somebody's coming! Stay outta there, I told ya! Don't go in there! Feed us! What the heck? What's going on? Mokichi! Take the kids! Got it! Hurry! Hurry! Come here! What the heck are you doing?! Go, go! Go, go! Riot, riot! Go, go! Don't do this! Don't do this! Please don't do this! Get a move on. Ushiku post station get a move on. Ushiku post station ushiku post station you'll miss your pre-wedding party. It's cramped in here. I'm scared. You're still not over your phobia? It came back again. The doctor said it won't g0 away so easily. Oh. Then I guess you need... Shock therapy! My lord! Glad you could join us! Sorry for the delay! My lord, congratulations on your wedding. I'm profoundly envious that you're taking such a beautiful consort. But don't forget, it cost us 30 ryo to buy her freedom! Now now, never mind that. Let's put it all behind us, and drink! Our trip to edo ended up as a wife-hunt for our lord! It sure did! Congratulations. Last month was a money-maker for you. Master! Spare me! Could you let me off for this? Genpachiro araki arms and armor magistrate spare me! Could you let me off for this? Genpachiro araki arms and armor magistrate genpachiro araki arms and armor magistrate please! Please! Genpachiro araki arms and armor magistrate genpachiro araki arms and armor magistrate ah! I surrender! Ar! I surrender! For you too. Kiyoemon imamura cook you're amazing. Want a permanent job? Why not? Sounds good to me. Hey, suzuki. How about you? Bullseye! A big bullseye! Sir yoshi, more prize money! Sir yoshi! Yoshinosuke suzuki chamberiain sir yoshi! Yoshinosuke suzuki Chamberlain yoshinosuke suzuki Chamberlain but sir, surely that's too ambitious! Yoshinosuke suzuki Chamberlain three?! Bullseye! Sir yoshi, you're the best! Move it! Here's your prize money. Let's call it quits, okay? Please sir, don't come back! Hey, he did it! Thank you! Well done! That was great. Thank you! What happened to danzo? He went to tsuchiura to see his wife and daughter. This is an heirloom of mine. Take it as a gift. Our fate depends on you. Danzo kumogakure our fate depends on you. Danzo kumogakure remember that. Gimme another drink. We're out. All you do is drink all day. Come on, eat something. Father! Don't drink too much. Wow! This water's delicious! Omiyo, another round. Yum yum! His wife and kid, huh? That lucky s.0.B.! I ain't even held hands with a girl! I wish I could marry a girl as pretty as osaki. But ya know, just between us... Our lord's relatives ain't happy. 'Cause she was a prostitute. That's a load of... Osak/ osaki, why are you here? Otomi... Your lord's waiting. Come in! Come on. Osaki is here! Wow. She's gorgeous. Holy crap! Way too gorgeous! This is torture for a single guy. A bowl of rice and eggplant soup how about some yard long beans with miso too? Knock it off! No Buddha dancing! This is a celebration! It's bad luck! You bumpkins! You had me clapping along! Osaki! Come on over! Lord naito, I.. Thank you for waiting! The priest is here. He's here? I'm the priest! That get-up suits you! Hey, you're the manager. Time to exchange cups. If I may be so bold, the lord of yunagaya is here. All revere him! All revere him! Excuse me! What? Someone else came. Someone else? So, first the priest, then a shrine maiden? A shrine maiden? Woohoo! Don't look, sir! A shrine maiden? A shrine maiden? She looks more like a dude. If she's a shrine maiden, I don't care! Idiot! Why are you drunk at a time like this?! It's segawa! Hey, you came all this way? My lord! Terrible news! Yasuemon segawa edo-based retainer terrible news! Yasuemon segawa edo-based retainer yasuemon segawa edo-based retainer farmers are revolting! Revolting?! What does that mean? Shut up! Segawa, what did you say? Repeat yourself. Farmers are revolting in yunagaya! Don't be silly. Our people never would. Indeed. They think too highly of our lord. Fukuda sent me a letter from back home. A riot broke out, and people are hurt. Men, the party's over. We're going home. Samurai hustle samurai hustle returns A revolt, you say? Who on earth would be unhappy? My lord, we mustn't dilly-dally. A revolt means our clan could be crushed. An inspector just left for yunagaya. This is bad. When will he arrive? In about two days time. Two days?! If we don't make it home by then and quell the revolt, we'll be crushed. That's crazy. We still have 40-ri to go. It took four days on the way to edo. You mean we have to travel twice as fast? That's impossible. My lord! What do we do?! Soma! What do we do?! Huh? Me? Think up a plan. Wait, that's too... Let's hear it on the count of three. One! Got it! That was quick! So, what do we do? We don't have time, so we don't eat or sleep. Or rest or stop. If we run unarmed with no baggage, we might just make it. Oh no... It'll wreck our legs. You'd rather see our clan wrecked?! We must be careful. Our service in edo is over, but we're not home yet. A revolt plus a failure to return would doom our clan for certain. To avoid suspicion, we must make it look like a procession. We formed a procession until ushiku. I guess we'll have to put on another show. Chief retainer! Do we have money to hire marchers again? We'll need gear too. I'll go back to work here. Osaki? Use the 30 ryo you paid for my freedom. Lady osaki, no one here wants you to do that. Very well. Get ready! We leave in 30 minutes! Osaki, come later by palanquin. Segawa, take care of her. Lord naito... We're going back to yunagaya. Gentlemen, haul ass! Day 1 "Ushiku post station” this palanquin is quite fast, but it's not a smooth ride. I don't mind. Let's go, m'lady. What about you? I've got a decent pair of legs on me. Let's go! Hey! Outta the way! "'Masaatsu naito” lord nobutoki. Gendo? The fools from yunagaya have departed ushiku with haste. Gendo yagyu owari yagyu samurai the fools from yunagaya have departed ushiku with haste. Naito. I'll make you scurry like a rat. Naka hiver serve in edo, live in yunagaya! Our journey ain't over yet! Don't break ranks! Chief retainer fell in! Don't go breaking ranks on us! Help m... Soma! Help m... I forgot! He can't swim! You're right! Chief retainer! Hang in there! You can do it! Oh no! My savior! We need you, sir! Look out! Suzuki! Suzuki! Suzuki! Soma! Soma! Where's suzuki?! The river took him away. He must be dead. I promised I'd introduce him to a girl... Don't worry. He can... swim! Yeah, he can! My lord, what now? We must get to yunagaya by tomorrow. I'm sure he'll catch up to us. Let's move! "Onuma post station” "onuma post station” watch it, watch it! Here, here! Here! Hurry, hurry! Hurry! I managed to scrape together 30 marchers. Hurry, hurry! We've got to make 30 look like 1.00? Without 100, it won't look like a procession for a clan of our size. We gotta try. You got the gear? I did, but... It's all busted stuff left behind by other processions. Can we do this?! We've gotta try. Bow down before... our lord! Araki. Wake up. A procession's here. You don't say. Finally. We're the yunagaya clan. Very well. Why the monkey? A gift from the shogun. The sacred primate, sir kikuchiyo! What's with all the black? The shogun is currently visiting nikko shrine. The black is to mourn for his late majesty, leyasu tokugawa. I see. That's commendable of you, but why march in five rows? That's our clan's traditional rectangular formation. Lords' processions are war marches. We are drilling our men in various arrays. How many are you? Five columns of 20 rows. That adds up to 100. That would be right for a clan your size. Sir kikuchiyo! Sir kikuchiyo! Sir kikuchiyo! Sir kikuchiyo! I'm terribly sorry for that. By the way, I found this lying on the road back there. This is... Obscene! Public morals must be protected. Please dispose of it. We'll do just that. Right then. Farewell! I'll go dispose of it. No, that won't do. I will. - Let go. - Don't be silly. You dispose of it. 100 marchers from the yunagaya clan. Fare thee well! Let us through... Let us through... Oh, lord nobutoki. Forgotten how to walk in the castle? Please forgive me. The yunagaya clan got him good. He was in line to be the next head councilor, but no more. He's a laughing stock now. - Thank you. - Much obliged. Good job. We're done here! Take care. That went well. Yeah, but to hire those marchers, I had to borrow 20 ryo from a rice broker. If the clan lives, so do we. We'll pay it back! Let's go! My apologies for not coming sooner. What shall we do about the peasant revolt in yunagaya? An inspector is on his way. If it's small, we could overlook it. Naito is not to be underestimated. When he arrives home, he'll quell the revolt. It is custom to censure lords when revolts break out. Surely you speak out of personal enmity? Absolutely not. I simply stated precedent. If a revolt occurs in yunagaya while the shogun is absent, by law, the clan must be crushed, and the lord replaced. Do you have a suitable candidate in mind to replace him? I know just the man. I apologize for before. Er, alright... The revolt will be dealt with. Fine. I'll take care of it. Anything else? I had a hard time remembering your name. Nobutoki's finished, lord inoue. Indeed. And it feels so good. Clear the way! You lout! What is this?! Y-y-you lout! D-do you know who I am?! Ah, this is the life. You're matchless, lord Tanaka. My lord? What is it? Gokuzo mori gokuzo mori blown to smithereens. Blown to smithereens. You're merciless. It is done. Good. 'Lord inoue lord Tanaka” Councilor. When you succeed, please Grant the owari yagyu's request. You owari have always been one with the shadows. We have long worked in darkness, but it is time we emerged into the light. Where is naito now? He has just passed onuma post station. Onuma? So quickly? He and his men are running non-stop. Those wretched fools. Gendo, leave immediately on horseback. If you fulfill your task, I shall place yunagaya in your hands. I humbly request that you do. Those backwoods samurai. This lime, I won't hold back. "Iakahagl” pay 2 hey, you okay? You can go. Next. Why are they checking people? In a higher voice. Okay, go. Next. Oh no! It seems they've got warrants for us. "Yunagaya clan rebels." "Do not let them pass"?! Your eyesight's almost superhuman. Move it! Why have they smeared us as rebels? Don't ask me. We can't waste time over this! What do we do?! Soma! Do something! Hurry up and think of a plan! Quickly! Don't rush me! Come on! All we can do is die. What'd you say?! Damn you, soma! You can go. They haven't come. They're country samurai, with a monkey. A monkey?! The shogunate's offering 100 ryo for them. That much?! I hope they pass through. Halt! What's up? Hey medicine peddler, what's this? Corpses. I be carryin' dem. It's so cramped... Hey! You can't do dat! Why not? Dey died of cholera. You gonna catch it. Stand back! Don't do it! Don't do it! I"m free! My lord! Move. They're dead alright. We could be cursed for this. Huh? Yeah, but... Move it. Move it! "Tis forbidden! "Tis forbidden! Hey. Did you hear that? No... It's divine wrath. It's divine wrath. You can go. Quickly! Go, go! Praise Buddha! Praise Buddha! Owari clan edo residence I hear owari is booming, lord muneharu. Severe frugality is stifling. Muneharu okugawa lord of the owari clan severe frugality is stifling. Muneharu 1okugawa lord of the owari clan muneharu okugawa lord of the owari clan theaters and whorehouses should be left alone. Theaters and whorehouses should be left alone. Absolutely. Much talk is made of reform, but 200,000 ryo is spent on visiting nikko, with no regard for the people. Perhaps. But nobutoki, you were bitten by a cornered rat. Piddling country clans are difficult to handle. They cling to their land like moss, and spout nonsense about "soil" and "spiritual homes." That yoshimune. He cares for the secondary branch families, but ignoring the three major families is an outrage! Since he became shogun, he has indulged himself with his harem, and reveled in his knavery. Exactly. My father was too reticent, and allowed yoshimune to usurp him. I will tolerate it no further. The next shogun should be you, lord muneharu. My plan to seize power is proceeding smoothly. Make sure of it. As you wish. Utsunomiya castle My sources inform me that nobutoki is up to no good. Fear not. Edo can count on ooka. But my shogun... Reform is lightening our burden. The shogunate is now a guiding light, and we must save our people from the torment of famine. As you wish. Is he alright? Is he hurt? Is he alive or dead? Take a look! Is he a floater? He's a young one. With a cute face. What a cute little stiff! He's alive! He's young. Where am 1? I need the naka river ferry... The ferry's back there. Oh. Mister samurai! At least take this. Thank you. Mind how you go! Mind how you go! “To suzuki: We'll keep going. Naito” Yunagaya's just beyond this forest! My lord, wait! What is it? Watch yourselves. We're not alone. Sandayu morosaka lajiro genshichi identify yourselves. This is our lord's procession from edo. This is your burial ground. Attack! Sir kiku! Grab this! Pick it up. The shinkage style? You're yagyu? Why do you yokels fight so well? Hey! Make your entrance! Danzo?! Why do this? Don't ask me! Fight me. Please. Danzo. I've learned many sword-fighting techniques. But I know no technique for killing a friend. My lord! Danzo! Get it over with! Father! Omiyo! Want me to kill her?! I surrender! Hey! Danzo hasn't betrayed us! Yeah. That's the danzo I know. You came back. Danzo! End this charade. Cut him down, danzo! Do it now! Here's your sword. Here. You fools! You're all dead... You're dead too! Come on! Go! Chase them! Chase them! Go! Go! Danzo! Let 'em have it! Araki! Araki! Yunagaya castle we made it! We arrived just in time. My lord! A fire! But why? What are they burning? That's our gear! You jackasses! What are you doing? Who the heck are you? This castle belongs to the owari yagyu! Poppycock! It belongs to the yunagaya clan! Who said you could put up your flags and burn our gear? You lowlife! Wait a minute! The yunagaya clan has been dissolved! What?! How?! An inspector's here? He left already. The councilor ordered it. As punishment for the revolt, you were expelled, and we took over. We were too late... That's absurd! That order came way too quickly! Here. You can take what we didn't burn. You're... naito! Hey! Everybody! It's naito! My lord, we should go. Darn it! We're done for. Our clan's finally been crushed! Get up! Our people need our help! My lord... Fukuda! What happened to you?! Please forgive me, my lord! I could not defend yunagaya alone. I'll pay with my life! No! My hand! Please, tell me what happened. It's too much to bear! Yanosuke fukuaa deputy retainer it's too much to bear! Yanosuke fukuaa deputy retainer Hilarious! They ran all the way home, only to learn they don't have one! They're nothing but vagabonds now. Has lord toshitomo arrived back? Yes. My master will soon depart for yunagaya. Good. I'll join him. I'll order naito to commit suicide in person. You'll come too? It's best I leave edo for now. Catch my drift? Indeed I do. While we're at it throw those oafs out of their home in edo too. Yunagaya clan edo residence yyunagaya clan edo residence go go go! Hurry up and get out! Yunagaya clan edo residence gentlemen! We'll take refuge with the iwakitaira clan! Princess, I must go. Wait, akiyama. What will you do? I can't forgive nobutoki for expelling us arbitrarily. You're not fully healed yet. Heigo akiyama secretary you're not fully healed yet. Heigo akiyama secretary heigo akiyama secretary yunagaya has been stolen! Princess koto younger sister of lord naito Princess koto younger sister of lord naito don't go. Princess koto younger sister of lord naito take this. "Henouncement of clan affiliation" take this. "Renouncement of clan affiliation” Akiyama... Who will you kill? Who are you?! Minamimachi magistrate, tadasuke ooka. Sheathe your sword! The revolt broke out without warning, rioting all the way to the castle. They took hostages. Not only clansmen, but also women and children. You lost to farmers? They weren't farmers! The revolt was a smokescreen. They were warriors in disguise! I escaped in order to inform you... Fukuda! Are my wife and daughter safe? I bet they're goners. We better hold a funeral. Chief, what names go on the grave tablet? Slow down! They might not be dead! Some people were injured, but they're all alive. What's more, those at the castle are imprisoned in the turret. They're alive? Ow! Ow! So-so-soma! Men, let's eat first. We ran non-stop from ushiku. Fukuda, could you arrange it? You bet. Hey! Prepare some food! Yessir! I'll use the toilet. Spare me! Silence, you dumb backwoods samurai! Get in there! You nincompoop! Let us out! Rfuyumi soma"s wife I can't take any more. It's time to end it... Mother! Lady soma! You were never this weak! All you talk about now is dying. But will sir araki, our lord, and my husband ever return? Rather than live in shame like this, death is more honorable! Then fight to the death! Show some guts! Ltomie araki's wife then fight to the death! Show some guts! But, but, but... Mother, compose yourself. Koume soma's daughter mother, compose yourself. Koume soma's daughter koume soma's daughter our lord will surely return. Our lord will surely return. We must be patient. Minamimachi magistrate's office edo minamimachi magistrate's office edo you want to kill nobutoki? He's abominable. I've left the yunagaya clan. Even so... Nobutoki has already crushed it. You say that was his doing? It is the only logical conclusion. Sir ooka, why did you stop me? Nobutoki has a seasoned bodyguard. Do you want to die in vain? There's no guarantee I would! You ruined my chance to kill him. I will not permit anarchy in edo! Magistrate, what were you doing there? Keeping tabs on nobutoki. I believe he had a hand in murdering a shogunate official. If I can catch the assassin, I'll catch nobutoki by his tail. The shogunate court will listen to me. You truly intend to bring nobutoki to justice? Such is my duty. Akiyama, will you help me? Here, seconds. So, who's behind the revolt? Nobody from yunagaya. The villagers all know each other. Masterless samurai, or bandits? It makes no sense to me. It's a plot by nobutoki. Hey! Danzo! Comrades, forgive me. Is your daughter alright? Yes. She's with an old friend now. Really? I'm so relieved! Say, danzo. You say nobutoki did it? Isn't he under house arrest? He was given amnesty due to the shogun's visit to nikko, and set free. That's not all. He sent his henchmen soon after we reached edo, and had them follow you, awaiting his chance for revenge. Are you serious? Why doesn't he use that zealousness for governance? Cracking down at checkpoints, sending an inspector to prematurely expel us, and using the yagyu to attack us. It was all nobutoki's doing?! Indeed. Nobutoki has used subterfuge to stage revolts in other domains, and extort money from fearful clans. In yunagaya, he used the owari yagyu. Specialists in espionage, assassination, and other trickery. That scoundrel. He used the revolt to seize control of yunagaya. We're caught like songoku in Buddha's palm! Calm down. First, we must think of our people. Tonight we rest, and at dawn, we scope out the village. I'll see what's going on at the castle. That's it, that's it. That's it, that's it! This! This! As samurai, you'll soon be caught. Disguise yourself as farmers. Oh crap. What have they done? Mokichi! M-my lord! My lord! You're alive! Only one radish survived. We gotta sow seeds and grow more! Mokichi. The real lords of yunagaya are people like you who are one with the soil. My lord! Yosaku! Gohei! You're alive and well! We're not well. The fields we worked so hard to nurture are ruined. Those bastards even smashed the waterway! We can't draw any. We can restore it. No we can't! The rioters took all the rice we just harvested. We can't live without it! This all happened because you weren't around. What can you do now?! You came back too late! Too late! I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. Outta the way! Stop! Lord naito! Osaki! You got here so quickly? Wait... I'm gonna hurl! Osaki? My lord! Oh, segawa! You made it too! I-I-l came as fast as I could. Segawa, yunagaya is scarred more deeply than we realized. Move out! That monk's the assassin. He was seen hear the murder scene. We need him alive. Let's go. Where's he going? Magistrate, we're being tailed. Don't turn around. It's a trap. You take the monk. But... If I don't return, go to Princess koto at the lwakitaira residence. And tell her what? That I loved her. I decline. Live to tell her yourself. That short sword... The toda school, huh? The very same. You sly dog... You lured me in here! You've... already lost. 'Hato 5 kawa 9 wa 8" Magistrate! I took him down. It seems I'm not as rusty as I thought. Is this really the place? It should be somewhere around here. Ow ow ow! Soma! You alright? Found it! You did? Where? I found it! Hey, it's the well! It hasn't been used since the waterway was opened. Man, it's deep. Even you can't see the bottom? I'd hate to fall in there... Cut it out! Come on, stop that. Quit messing around, fathead. Does it still have water? Beats me. You were lucky, kiku! Chief retainer! You alright? Save me fellas! I'm gonna drown! Hey, there's water! Fantastic! The village can use it. But is it gonna be enough? Won't know till we try. Hey! Hurry up and help me! Hey you guys! Why are you so quiet? I'm scared. Because the fate of my clansmen and my people rests squarely on my shoulders. I've never heard you sound so fainthearted before. Fainthearted? Some things can't be helped. If matters become worse, I'll be killed along with you. Osaki... You know, until I met you, my life was colorless. Everything was black and white, like a dream. I wanted it to end. So you're quiet at first, then you get fired up? What a sleazebag. But since you rescued me at ushiku, for the first time, I've felt alive. Is there anything I can do to help? There is. The village has no money or food. If we could cook for them... I'll do it! Finally, I can be useful. Nice and hot, huh? We're bathing. Let's not act rashly. Fair enough. Why not give up? The yunagaya domain belongs to the yagyu now. Why do you want to be a lord? Not satisfied with your lot? Compared to the yagyu in edo, we've always walked in the shadows. We want to feel the sunshine. Our domain's a poor one. Plus, you've got to serve in edo. You're better off without a master. You should stay home and Polish your swordsmanship. The time for that has passed. These days, swordsmen are looked upon as irksome. Abacus wielders are far more highly valued. It's a sorry situation. Honestly, I don't want your domain. I just want to keep fighting the yagyu way. You'll get your wish, soon enough. You made it! Help yourself! Is it yummy? It's yummy! Ow! Ow ow! Ow ow ow! Hey, wet your hands first. Then the hot rice won't stick to them. I can't even do this. If you can't, do it till you can. Nobody can at first. Right, okame? Right! How's this? Looks fine to me. Just add a little salt. Anyway, you're a hard worker. And pretty. You'll make a perfect wife for our lord. No, a lowly woman like myself shouldn't marry an aristocrat... Don't be so silly! Our lord hates all that stuffy carry-on. He always runs off to have fun with us! He sure does. He yells out, "anybody need a babysitter?" All the kids in this village have been cradled by him. He remembers all our names too. A down-to-earth girl like you will fit right in. Can I have more? I bet he's running around trying to do good for us right now. Leave us alone! What do you want?! You're naito's woman. And you're coming with me. Move it! What are ya doing?! Move! Father! Leave this land now. We're building a yagyu dojo here. These are my fields! All of yunagaya is yagyu territory now. Scram! Father! Don't go! My lord! Oh, danzo. Your clansmen imprisoned in the castle will be beheaded tomorrow. What? From what I've heard, nobutoki is coming to watch. My lord! Tasuke! My lord! My father's fields... What of them? Bad men are wrecking them. Come with me! Mokichi! It's alright! It's no big deal! Not this... Don't be foolish. You worked so hard on these fields. I-it doesn't matter! Yes it does! You and your wife put your hearts and souls into them! I can't take it! Nobutoki... You'll pay for this. My lord. No government should torment its people. We'll take back our castle, and save our people! It's about time you said that! But what about weapons? Soma! Got a plan? I got a hundred of 'em! My lord! What's wrong? It's osaki! Osaki's been captured and taken away by some strange fella! Minamimachi magistrate sir ooka of echizen is present in court! Face me! Now, comply and tell me everything. If you release me, I'll see to it that you become more than a magistrate. And how will you elevate my status? Can you guarantee it? I shall talk to a certain official. The man closest to the throne. Such a tempting offer. However, if you were to flee, I would lose face. I will recommend you. To whom? I cannot say. However, I'm sure he will advance your career. Does this man truly possess that much power? He does, as a councilor to the shogun. The only thing is, I'm on close terms with a councilor myself. The shrewdest man in the shogunate, lord nobutoki matsudaira. Are you saying your acquaintance is more powerful than he? How fortuitous! My acquaintance happens to be lord nobutoki. I worried for nothing! Now, release me. I'll put in a good word for you. You simpleton! So nobutoki has been pulling the strings. You tricked me! I would never do such an underhanded deal in court! You will be punished. Count on it! Take him out! Wait! Hmm? What is it, akiyama? There's one mystery remaining. Why did this yagyu not accompany nobutoki to yunagaya? Now I know the answer. You found that on one of his stooges? I did. These are places and times. Hatogaya at 5, kawaguchi at 9, and lwabuchi at 8. Surely not... They are. The route the shogun is presently taking to nikko passes through hatogaya, kawaguchi, and iwabuchi. 5,9, and 8 are... The times he will be there. If my suspicion is correct, the yagyu will set up an ambush, in order to assassinate the shogun! Good god... Nobutoki has gone to yunagaya so that he'll have an alibi when the shogun is killed. It's possible. We must put a stop to nobutoki's treachery! Mito post station lord's lodgings mito post station lord's lodgings tomorrow we reach yunagaya, lord toshitomo. Tomorrow we reach yunagaya, lord toshitomo. Oh, is that so? Loshitomo yagyu head of the owari yagyu family oh, is that so? Loshitomo yagyu head of the owari yagyu family loshitomo yagyu head of the owari yagyu family as we speak, gendo loshitomo yagyu head of the owari yagyu family loshitomo yagyu head of the owari yagyu family will be making preparations for will be making preparations for your triumphant entry to the castle. Make sure it is taken care of. Leave it to me. Time to depart! Chief retainer! Your plan! Wait! I've got it! If danzo goes in here and draws them away, the yagyu will come out of the castle. Oh. That's when we strike? Lady osaki's been captured! Time's a wasting! Open the gate! Open the gate! An urgent message from lord toshitomo! Please wait here. Our lord is in iwaki, but the yunagaya clan is fighting back? What was that?! The children! Take the children! Yes ma'am! Don't be afraid! Come with us! It's alright. My husband... The time has come. Excuse me. Excuse me! What is it? My child has a fever. Huh? You're overreacting. Show some self-control. Mine just ran out. Let's go! My lord! Hey! You all made it! Yes! Here are your weapons! Excellent! Father! Koume! Where's your mother? She's safe, in the turret. Excellent! I feel naked without this. We're samurai again. My husband. What took you so long? We nearly starved to death. No more araki family! Sorry. Sorry. My husband! My lord! All went to plan. Come on fellas. Let's go! That rocket... It's a trap. Go back! What's all this? My lord! Osaki! Osaki... Osaki! Thank goodness. I became a burden on you again. I heard that you tried to protect the villagers. I'll go back to ushiku. I'll send back what you paid for me, so just go. I'm not important. You are important! You were sold as a child. You did nothing wrong. But I'm a nuisance! You'll be ridiculed because of me. Doubters don't matter. What do you want? I... I want to be with you, of course! That'll do me! Wait! What's wrong? What do you want, lord naito? You made me tell you, but you never told me. M-me? My lord! Naito! En garde. Lord naito, tell me. I know exactly what I want! Don't be vague. Tell me straight. Right now?! Masaatsu naito! Behold the yagyu shinkage style... Ish't marrying you enough?! Tell me properly! Osaki! Osaki! Hear me! I am one of the yagyu's seven Spears... Shut up! Osaki. Ever since the day we met, I've been in love with you. That will never change until the day I die. Lord naito... My lord! You're gonna... do that now? Danzo, take care of osaki for me. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. Lord naito... Open the gate! Open the gate! Kill them all! This is where I cut in! You ain't gonna lay a finger on 'em! Attack! Suzuki! Sorry I'm late! It's a lot higher up here than I thought... I'm arrow-proof! Do your worst! You can't Pierce this armor! Bullseye. Everyone alright? I was so scared! Sir suzuki! We needed you! We sure did! I was so scared! Oh come on, man. What are we, chopped liver? You should hide. Take this. Hey! You came. We meet again. My lord. Leave this fella to me. State your name. Genpachiro araki. At your service! I am sandayu morosaka. That was a good fight. You dishonored the yagyu! Are you crazy? Move! Weren't you watching? Your comrade put his life on the line to fight for you yagyu! There is only victory, or death. We have no need for losers! I pity your inability to feel his pain. Silence! Your time is at an end. My lord! Now we have a domain and castle of our own... Are those the words of a proud yagyu? Sandayu... You have betrayed me? I did not devote my life to the sword for pathetic personal ambition. All I wanted... Was to live in the light! Men, let us return to our home. End this disgrace. We shall start anew. Lord naito. Nobutoki won't stop at yunagaya. He'll take the shogun's life, to seize the seat of power. Be careful. Are you serious? He'd assassinate the shogun? That's his scheme? It is time for us to leave. Iakahagi post station lord's lodgings [akahagi post station lord's lodgings what?! What?! Yunagaya castle has been retaken?! Yes councilor. Gendo has been killed! Those vermin... Prepare for battle! The rebel masaatsu naito must be killed! Segawa. Our castle's in your hands! Ow ow ow! What did you do that for?! I told you, you can't fight. I'm so ashamed... I never imagined that nobutoki would try to kill the shogun. He was after our gold mine a month ago to fund his scheme. If he's won over the yagyu, he might very well seize power. We're going up against a formidable opponent. My lord! Nobutoki has arrived. At last... How many men? Approximately 1,000. Do we stay in the castle? No. If they surround us, the fields will be ravaged further. Then what? I'm grateful for your loyalty. You've done well to serve a lord like me. I couldn't be happier. Now it's time for me to fight. If I'm defeated, my head will keep nobutoki happy for a while. Use that opening to escape with our clansmen. You're going by yourself? It's my fault yunagaya was attacked and our people were hurt. I don't deserve to be your lord. I must take responsibility. My lord! There's no such strategy in which a clan goes to battle without its leader. I shall join you. Soma... I'll go too. As a warrior, I wouldn't miss a fight like this for the world. Indeed! Let's show 'em what yunagaya's made of. My lord! I'll stay with you till the end. My bow finger's itching. My friends... Count me in too. Danzo?! Don't worry. I'm not good with women, so I left osaki with segawa. It's my honor! Every single one of you... Is an idiot. Alright. Follow me. Our only target... Is nobutoki's head! Do your best. They've gone. It seems that all I can do is wait. Waiting is part of the battle. Lord naito, please come back safe. Who the heck are they? Are those seven really gonna try to fight us? How amusing. And fitting for dirt-poor samurai. Seven against 1,000! This has gotta be a first! No, we're more than a match for a thousand. Let's cut them to shreds. I could take 'em all by myself. That's funny. So could I. If so, we'll beat them easily. Masaatsu naito! For the crime of rebellion, I order you to commit suicide! I refuse. If the shogunate's that foolish, I can no longer obey it. What? Don't you get it? I'm saying we're gonna fight! From here on, we're just some warriors from iwaki. Councilor nobutoki! You not only orchestrated a revolt, you plotted to assassinate the shogun, and schemed to seize power, you heinous criminal! Kill him! Kill all of them! Smoke 'em! We gladly accept your challenge. Forward! Charge! Go! Go! I can't see a thing. Stop your dithering! Kill them! Onward! Kill them! Spare them no mercy! Leave none alive! Nobutoki! What are you doing?! Kill them! Where'd he go?! Nobutoki's retreated to the rear! We can't get near him. He has the devil's luck! Nobutoki! There he is! Move! Come out coward! Lineage rules supreme in this world. Inherited wealth breeds more. The poor should grovel to give the rich all they have! No! Lineage ain't supreme! The people around us are the most important! People are priceless! Friends are priceless. Ludicrous! People will always betray you in the end. Nobutoki. Why not atone for your sins by moving to yunagaya? It ain't a fancy life, but you'll feel alive. Have you gone mad? Enough mockery! I ain't mocking you. Kill him. Kill this man! I won't betray you. Attack! Do you hear me?! Kill him! Kill masaatsu naito! The time is not right. Return to owari. Yes my lord! Let's go! Let's go! That dotard! We're gonna protect our lord! Take a hike! Or get a butt-kicking! You insignificant worms. Nobutoki! Stop right there! It's been a while, councilor. Tadasuke ooka. Why are you here? I am off duty in edo, so I came to arrest you. You what? Bearing a gift from edo! Akiyama! He told us everything. Nobutoki ordered him to kill Chamberlain Tanaka, and assassinate the shogun! Nobutoki. Come quietly! You're nothing but a common town magistrate. Kill him! Kill this man! Nobutoki! End this now! Make way! Make way! Chief councilor terusada matsudaira is here! Uncle! You're done. Nobutoki matsudaira! I hereby strip you of your office, and consign you to lord tadanaga Honda of koga. A traitor like you... Has no place in my family! Naito. I return yunagaya to you. With my apologies. I have but one request. That my ravaged domain be restored to its former state. Yes. It shall be done. The shogun also desires it. Naito, if it hadn't been for you... Ooka! You dare to put me in bonds?! You are not fit to be a samurai. Take him away! Release me! It is too late for me to escape! I shall be proven right! Gentlemen! The yunagaya clan's return from edo is now complete! Just when I ran out of smoke bombs, and booze... My shogun, we are overjoyed that you have returned safely. The yunagaya affair has been resolved. Kudos to naito. He has again defended the soil of yunagaya. As we must do for edo. The people are our bedrock. Forgive me my shogun, but isn't banishing nobutoki to a distant island too lenient? Anger brings enemies. Forbearance brings lasting peace. Nevertheless, nepotism has endangered the shogunate... I like those smiling faces! The fields were also our children's playgrounds. This soil will nurture our children and grandchildren. Akiyama will continue to serve in edo. Thanks to our lord's kindness. Get yourself a wife too! You cramp our style. Got a girl in mind? I do. Well, it won't be difficult for you. Actually, it is. I can't tell her how I feel... Huh? Who on earth is she? Okame. You like, er, older women? Is that bad? Oh no! Not at all. On the contrary, it's good! Suzuki! You're a true friend! Gentlemen! Your meals are ready. Dig in! Sorry for the wait! Wow, it looks delicious. Suzuki... suzuki... I made this... with these hands. Come and eat these too! Hey kids! Dig in! Hey, this is it! This is what I wanted to eat! Oh boy, this is heaven! Iwaki radishes taste great even when they're broken! Delicious! Daddy, where are we going? Oh, my lord! My lord, lady osaki! Come and dance with us!
