Ripped By PoOlLa I once recited a story that's full of sweet memories of college... carved on classroom benches and the walls of the corridor... we are still not satiated so many fond memories that I need to find new places to etch them... Dude...who is he? (Superstar Upendra is mouthing hit dialogues from his film) Dude...the movie is over... So what if are done with this film? We have another Upendra's film. Dude...we have a class to attend Hey,..shut up! Two previous classes have already been mass bunked by us We are now facing an attendance shortage due to the lack of proxy The marks scored by us during exams are missing on our report cards But I'm sure we will clear a couple of papers during the revals Two previous classes have already been mass bunked by us We are now facing an attendance shortage due to the lack of proxy The marks scored by us during exams are missing on our report cards But I'm sure we will clear a couple of papers during the revals It will be useful in the future Yes Crowd cheers for Sanvi I once recited a story that's full of sweet memories of college... carved on classroom benches and the walls of the corridor... Saanvi... your's is the only name that is written in the pages of all our life stories... Aren't quarrels a pan of friendship? Compromise and understand that in unity lies strength One or two strikes are essential in the name oi social cause Seems like our time in college will not suffice, so let us buy a site on the campus Oh s%&*t the power went 0TH! Oh s%&*t the power went 0TH! Yeah, I can see that... How the hell can you see in the dark??? Manager...where the hell are you??? Switch on the generator Manager...where the hell are you??? Manager please take them away!! He couldn't figure out who it was! Dude, I'm leaving. Come along if you want to Where to? Mark it, lm sure it won't appear in the question paper! How about we all wear a tie to the talents day? Oho... so sad That's 0k, I'll help her. Dude, move aside... I'll help too! It's ok. Here, take your book. Here, take it. It's a little heavy... here's another book. Ohh... have we picked all the books? Dude I gave her three books! This guy pretended to pick books long after we were done! Who the hell was looking at the books?? Do you need any help? Yeah...l thought as much... ls it a long climb up? Yes, we need to get to the third floor Ok, then do me a favour... please open this book for me... Why? I love reading...it will be a good timepass So what books have you read? I am a voracious reader, but I can't recall the names in an instant Oh yeah, but the other day, I read an article written by you Ok...which one? The one you wrote on sex workers So did you read it because of me, or did the topic interest you? That's a valid point. Will ponder over it and let you know. I had never had a bird's eye view of the college before. By the way, what are you doing here? I teach Kannada to the non Kannadigas So do you speak Kannada fluently? Hello! I studied in a residential school... so, even though I may not speak fluent Kannada, I can read and write it perfectly. Good to know that. You must have a full house then? Oh...yes... Shall I keep these books here? Sure Oh...what a massive crowd! I can't even see the faces of the ones sitting in the last bench! It must be tough to control so many of them! I've heard a lot about you. Being in the first year, you're already trying to cozy up to the seniors. Then you help her by carrying her books to the third floor. I know, you're trying to impress a senior. L've been speaking to you for such a long time and you don't even have the courtesy to stand up in front of a senior!! Sir, please sit down... Sir, there's no chair in sight... Oh my god! At 8 pm, it's scorching hot! Where are my sunglasses? Manja, be quiet! (Swears in his mother tongue) Everybody...listen up...silence...one minute please... The reason we've all gathered here today is... to take revenge. A senior has barged into our room and beaten up one of us... Look at the way he's been thrashed... He's been thrashed like a dog! Just because we are juniors, they're harassing us. This has got to stop now. Who is this mad cap?? Hey dude! Juniors are... Here take this... Why? Take it. Such important matters need to be conveyed from a prominent platform. What do they take us juniors for? Poor fellow. The way he's been beaten up...his teeth are... His teeth are rattling Look at how badly he's been thrashed He's been thrashed like a dog! It we tolerate this behavior without protest, we will go down in our college history as cowards. If we put up a united fight now, we will be known as legends among our juniors in the future! Long after we have passed out of this college, ourjuniors must recite tales of our bravery. All of you once more take a look at that poor innocent boy... look at how badly he's been thrashed... He's been thrashed like a dog! Ok fan boys...shut up! Is everyone with me on this? Boss, it was your idea to wear a tie. But seems like the whole college is wearing it today! What's your problem? (Curses in his mother tongue) Come on boys... Pick up a bat and come fast... Are you the six students who've been suspended? Sir, we are not wastrels... we are just bored of doing nothing We do not intend on escaping to the nearest bar But we seem to find no other way If you throw us last benchers out of college, Let me go, I have a class to take We have no problem, it is their reputation that will be at stake Dad it's me Manja. I needed 10 thousand rupees urgently. Why son? I have to buy a lethe machine What? A lethe machine?? Yes dad, I want to get the question paper leaked and later sell them. All I need to invest is ten thousand rupees. It's a profitable business. Very good my son. I'll send the money right away. He agreed that easily? What's your dad's profession? Balcony seats for 200 rupees only... We have 30,000 rupees We have 50,000 rupees How did you manage to collect all this money? What can I do...? The price of revaluation fees, tuition fees, electricity bill and canteen bill have all shot up. What about the water supply bill? It's still being printed. Dude. ..look for cheap cars 80 thousand rupees?!!! We are still short of another 30 thousand rupees“. Blessed with divine information while in the womb... all that is left for me is to execute the mission. I will once again rebuild the Rama Sethuve... Dude...but there's no water! But why do you need water to build a bfldge? I will once again rebuild the Rama Sethuve... My gang of workers is ready... We have so much more work to do and many more miles to go... But where's the time do all of it...for time itself is running short The burden on our shoulders is a lot... may be we could share it Such a beautiful car. Why are you selling it for such a cheap pflce? Is there a problem with it? Absolutely no problem! It came here for repairs. I called the owner after repairing it and told him him to pay 80 thousand rupees and take it. To which he said, “Dude, get lost. I can get a new car for that amount.You can keep this one!. What did he say sir? He said, “Dude, get lost. I can get a new car for that amount. You can keep this one!” But I have my doubts that this bundle contains only 50 thousand rupees. And we have our doubts if this car is really in a working condition... All this is ok. But don't betray me when you have to pay the balance of thirty thousand rupees, ok? I heard six students have been suspended from your college. Are you the same guys? Sir, we are not wastrels... we are just bored of doing nothing We do not intend on escaping to the nearest bar But we seem to find no other way If you throw us last benchers out of college, we have no problem It is your reputation that will be at stake Dude...let's give her a drop today. Who will be the lucky boys to drop her? The two of us. The key is with me. The three of us. Did you gather all these students? The last two rows of students were arranged by me. Why are you here?

Hey, what do you want? Looking for Saanvi Joseph. Same family, give it to me. Sir please sign here. Over here? I 'm trying to chart a new territory in love... But I tend to lose track sometimes... The art of conveying emotions through gestures... Wait and find out for yourself the true essence of love The enduring bond... the captivating intimacy... The desire to be around you has now grown stronger... The moments that I spend with you have surpassed even my expectations... In your dreams... She comes close to you... Cuddles you... I can't handle her tickles Hi Saanvi, how come you called at this hour? You're unable to sleep? Even lm unable to do so We are unable to contain our envy!! Hi Sanvi karna, I need your help and it's urgent? Can you come home? There's no time to explain. Tell me can you make it or not? It's what I wanted anyway. I'll be there in half an hour. Where are we going? Sonu, we'll be there in ten minutes. Karna, make it quick. Whose face did I see when I woke up this morning? Is it the goddess of beauty or luck who is sitting in front of me? The black and white dream that I saw last night has turned colouriul today... I am now in the mood to pen poems in your name In your dreams... She comes close to you... Cuddles you... I can't handle her tickles Once more... In your dreams... She comes close to you... Cuddles you... I can't handle her tickles I can't handle her tickles Karna, what are doing? Saanvi, where are we going? Remember the article I wrote on a sex worker? We are going to see her. Oh, her? This is her house. I heard the wails and guessed this must be it Sonu, don't worry. Let's go to the hospital. Karna, let's go to a hospital. Quick! Don't yell. I'm getting tensed. We have a woman in labour. Not her. She's in the car. Sir, we need a signature... from the father of the child. That's not me! Even a guardian can sign What happened? ls she okay? Do you want to see the baby? No that's ok. Come on... Thank you! Don't thank me. Thank him. The baby is extremely cute lithe baby is alive today, Saanvi is the reason for it. If not for her, I'd have aborted it long time ago. I was frightened to even think of how she'd be treated by society. Saanvi gave me courage. In my line of work, there's no lack of people who display love But nobody sticks around. I don't know if this child is a fruit of love or lust, but I'm going to raise her with all my love What are you thinking about? I was thinking about the baby We will do our best. The rest is upto God. Once upon a time, even Sonu was a little girl. Was it pan of God's plan to make her a sex worker? Why are you assuming that the baby won't have a bright future? Pain or gain, maybe it's for her own good I've seen the Karna who gets into fights with seniors and gets suspended from coflege Today, I see a new side of you. I'm not saying that the Karna in college is wrong. But you're trying hard to hide the softer side of you. Ok, it's a serious subject. I'll think about it. I'm unable to find answers. Oh god, so many messages! I'm just not able to spend time with my friends. Ok, I'm ofi for a shower Dude, that underwear is mine Ok take! Did you give it a thought? I'm still thinking Where is he? And the phone? I thought about it. What? It there's another side to me, there must be one to you as well. Why not the both of us get together and explore that side of you? Explore?? Ok then. I'm game to find that other side of me. You do the same. Why have you poured me a drink? I've quit alcohol. L'll see you guys later. Dude, where's the car? Ok then, let's go out. At this hour? No way! There is a way? Jump off the balcony. I meant I can't come out. Where are the car keys? Not that, not that! It's in the wash basin You better get your pockets stitched I won't take no for an answer. I'm already outside your house. Are you crazy? Why did you come here at this hour? Hello...why? Didn't I come when you called me? Now I'm asking you to come out with me and you better do so. Karna, try and understand! It's well past midnight and I can't come out now. If you don't come out now, I'm going to blare the horn and wake up the whole neighbourhood. No!!!! Don't do that Karna. Please don't make noise. All right, for your sake I give up the idea of honking. You come down now. Please concentrate on the road The road is in bad shape...l don't want to look at it. Don't you have the sense to honk at an intersection? The horn is not working Are you joking? Do you know what my dad will do if he gets to know of this...? What? ls he going to repair it for me? So where are we going now? To eat some corn Karna, have you ever come here before? Why will I come to an unknown place? Actually, on a highway... Thought I fell down? I went to pluck some corn. karna, I'm getting scared... we have trespassed somebody's field...what if we get caught? I got another one Karna, tell me about your family... My family comrprises me, my father and grandfather. Just the three of us. And your mother? I don't remember her at all What does your dad do? He's a don. Long ago, he would take to the streets with his tights. Now he's old. So he plays chess at home. Let alone my father, you should hear my grandpa's tales... you'll be shocked. Is he such a terror? March 28. 1946. Maybe past 5 in the evening. He went to a street cart to eat pakodas. And while he was eating the pakodas, he asked for extra chutney. The vendor refused My grandpa wouldn't take no for an answer. The vendor said he was out of chutney. My grandpa volunteered to help him with the grinding for the chutney, but instead went on to beat him to a pulp instead. In the midst of all this, a British officer came to break up the fight. He yelled at them to stop which my grandpa mistook for a cuss word. That's it. He shifted focus to the officer and thrashed him like a dog. The villagers who witnessed this scene labelled my grandpa a freedom lighter. Happy that he'd receive pension, my grandpa complied with the label. Here eat the corn. Good story. Is that an elephant? No way! True. How can an elephant come here? It sounds like it is an elephant. Ok, I think it is an elephant. Saanvi, why are you scared? Elephants are harmless. Don't run...it won't harm us. What a silly girl you are! Getting scared of an elephant, that toot! Saanvi, can you accompany me till there? Two teas please... and a cigarette for me Oh, how of foolish of me...l've quit smoking! Cancel that cigarette. You haven't told me anything about your family... We don't have an exciting history like your family... My father is strict, but that's okay. He's a cop after all! You should bribe him and get your way. Is he extremely strict? Not really...he's a nice guy. A little short tempered and says things he doesn't mean when he's angry. And that hurts sometimes. How do you deal with hurt? I go to church And when you're happy? I go to church Come let's go there At this hour? Sam, doth worry. I'll be your safety net. Come here... jump! Let's go')? karna, let's climb the church tower? Okay, let's climb! Hey! What are you doing? Haven't we come here to ring the bell? Are you crazy? The whole neighbourhood will be up. It's 5am. See they're already praying aloud, so why don't we ring the bell too? As we mature, so do our thoughts, isn't it? You start thinking that you're mature and beyond childish behaviour. We try to hide all our childish desires. All those tun things we did tonight, has made me feel like a child again. Okay so shall I ring the bell? As they sway gently on a swing, Krishna and Radhe are lost in their moment As Krishna whispers sweet nothings into her ears, Shyness overwhelms Radhe As he entwines the edge of her sari with his finger, while caressing her lustrous hair, Igniting her senses, he raises her coy face towards him As they sway gently on a swing, Gently placing his ears to her heart And wrapping her in a warm embrace, As he lovingly runs his fingers on her lips to catch the unspoken words She answers with a soft sigh As she begins to bare her soul to him The universe witnessed this union Her lips began to quiver... having experienced a sweet moment As Krishna and Radhe swayed gently on a swing, Saanvi, you forgot my shin I won't give it back. If we try, I'm sure we can fit in dude. Will it just be the two of us? Ladies Hostel! Their farewell party is on.. If the ladies get to know we're here, they'll celebrate our arrival! Dude! I'll go ahead and check if the coast is clear. If it is, I'll come and fetch you guys. Who is this handsome young man... who has stealthily made his way here at the right hour? Jumping over the fence, spreading smiles, he has been drawn here like a butterfly is to a garden I lost my way and wound up here This Tom cat slipped up and landed in our midst Where has my gang of boys disappeared? Where the hell are they having left me behind? Once you've come and been held captive here, do you think you can escape easily? We are really sorry. We will not be swayed by your false praise We can pay a fine if you want Enough with your fake stories Somebody please help and bring me down... please offer some help.. How can we send away a guest so rare without honouring him? We will see him ofi with special honours Isn't this a little extreme? Do you want to see a different a facet of us? You're a group of bluffmasters. Why do you take unnecessary pride in it? Beware we know how to deal with guys like you. Don't exceed your limits... You stay silent and mind your own business You think you own this place? Please don't worry, we think nothing of that son Don't cross your limits and act oversman We make our own course just like the wind Your spirits are high with all the booze you've had It's high time you leave now We have troubled you enough for tonight We shall see you in college tomorrow... Dude, you gave us away! (Senior abusing karna with the choicest words) Guys, shut up! Hello! Don't you have any respect for your seniors? Not only are you hitting on a girl from our class, but you also beat up a boy from our class, too. I'll finish you off in the first year itself! What are you staring at? You think you're a hero? You're all in the final year. Once you pass out, don't you dare step in to the campus for the next three years. Why? Because I will still be in this college karna, what happened? Tell us... Saanvi, what are you writing? ls it about karna? Neetu! Come here, take this diary! Neetu, please give it back! Don t give it to her, give it here! Will it just be the two of us? Are you writing about karna? (Breaks into popular Kannada film song) (Breaks into popular Kannada film song) So what if he's a junior? Sachin Tendulkar is 6 years junior to his wife! Let's all raise a toast and celebrate Saanvi's new found love. No way, I don't want a drink. It's a big deal that I've got permission to stay in the hostel. Oh shut up. 2 months is all we have left of college life. Who knows where each of us will be after that? Saanvi, please don't give us excuses. We're all drinking today and that's final. I've never had a drink before.. As ii we drink everyday! This is our first time too. What?!! Okay fine... may be the second or third time. Another peg and she'll spill out all her secrets. Okay enough, I'll pour the drink myself. Okay that's it. I'm not saying anything more. What happened? Even I don't know They are not letting anyone go that side (Tension prevails) Apparently she got drunk and fell off the third floor. How did you get to know? Tanu called me Look Karna's there.. karna, what happened'? (A funeral ceremony is in progress) Karna's alone, come lets go to him. That's Saanvi's father. I'm sorry The reputation of your college has been tarnished because of my daughter. For god's sake! Can you please stop watching that video on repeat?! For the misfortune of being her parent, I've fulfilled my obligations and completed her last rites. Don't ever speak of her again. Sir, look at this clip. Oh this girl! I've seen her roaming the streets at night with some boy. Oh this girl! I've seen her roaming the streets at night with some boy. O tongue that is spinning malicious lies I'm now consumed by the anger to split you into two Serves her right for drinking... Dude, I've seen this video. Do you have more videos of her? When I see people shaming you, my blood boils with anger O tongue that is spinning malicious lies I'm now consumed by the anger to split you into two karna, open the door! When I see people shaming you, my blood boils with anger Guys, look at the notice board, our Julie miss is on it! An obituary for a person who fell off the building after getting high on alcohol! Come guys! She'd come whenever I called her. So she's had a drink with you, too? Ask me what I haven't done with her? A lie stays hidden, like the embers within the ashes Like a desire that stays, just like the smoke after tire A man who has no grip over his tongue is heartless, too I'll ensure your shadow is not spared from the hands of death The circus that ensues among the ugly minds who fall prey to empty lies It's time to separate truth from the lies For you burn with jealousy when goodness abounds Even at the hour of death, you will not let go of your malicious ways Do not spare such evil souls, take them away from here O lord And while you make excuses, you have no reason to live O tongue that is spinning malicious lies I'm now consumed by the anger to split you into two When I see people shaming you, my blood boils with anger The ones who burn with jealousy will turn into ashes themselves The ones boiling with rage, will themselves evaporate The sins are not the ones committed, but uttered So when you have done wrong, be prepared to face the wrong Beware, just look behind, it's coming after you... You will be entangled in the web of your own sins You have to give an account for every dirty game you've played So come, face your reality... I am here to destroy the fortress of falsehood So come, gear up for a fight Here's a warning to all the students who've come to our college from other institutions. Listen carefully You've come here to panicipate in our function stick to participating and watching the programmes.. And take home a prize if you win. But it I hear of anyone teasing our female students, the programme will keep getting interrupted. The cultural programme will now continue. What were you guys performing? Ok...continue... Don't you have any sense? She's crying I can see...that! If somebody comes... stop your peHormanceL... If you face any problem, don't you have the sense to come and inform us about it? What are we seniors around for? What are you staring at? Console her. Please be consoled! OK enough Ok I was to myself. He was the one who came and troubled me You duffer, say it Kannada. Don't you know the language?? I didn't speak to you, shut up! He was extremely rude... All I asked him was, "why don't you speak in Kannada?" You arrived on the scene by then. Ok please ensure that it doesn't repeat again Ok... continue with your performance (Performance to Raghavendra Rajkumafls hit song) Don't bother trying to catch Karna's attention. He hasn't looked at a girl in 3 years. That's 0k... I'll adjust He hasn't shaved in ages! I don't care! I love it He's extremely short tempered That's ok. He'll change once we get married! Married? What do you even know about him? I know his entire history How can anyone not know? Everybody knows how he had become after Saanvfs death. It was us who helped him get over the tragedy. And now he's acting smart with us! It was these boys who showed karna attitude Because they were Computer Science students and Karna was in Mechanical Didn't Karna involve these boys when he conducted that fest last year? Yes, he involved us. But karna and his boys pocketed all the profits. All lies! People never speak the truth karna can never be wrong. If he can do no wrong, then why did karna keep the car? Didn't we all pitch in with money to buy it? But he's cleared all their dues My foot! He hasn't cleared anything! He still has two pending papers. According to the rules, he isn't eligible to contest elections. That is the reason why Karna got the elections canceled. They let him contest the elections because of the ruckus he created. It was because of Karna that even the fest was held much before elections. Elections can be held at any time. But karna is bound to win it. Anybody can win if they resort to goondagHL. That is what Karna has been doing all these years. Do you remember what happened last year? He got us beaten up because we supported the students from ou r branch. He didn't even care that we were his friends... He didn't care that they were his friends. You should have been there! You should have been there. Were you there? Those who witnessed the fight, told me No matter what anybody says, we shouldn't spare Karna this time. Let it all be done face to face...this time both of us are standing for elections. And no matter what, we have to win this election. What's up Sankoch! Who are you voting for this time? Dude, both karna and you are good friends of mine So I've decided to not vote this time. Are the designs okay? Please excuse me... What's up guys...you've used a bench as your party symbol! Tell them to print this. It's not just a bench... We belong to the last bench party We don't need anyone's permission for we are the rulers here Set the stage for us and keep the whistles coming We are set to make our entry Let's begin campaigning yes, there are just two weeks left for elections When compared to us, there are more students in Computer Science Moreover, they have lS's support, so let's not risk it Ah... so you've come to tell me to withdraw from the elections? Oh, was a class going on here? That's ok! He was my classmate at one point! Come Surru, let's go out. They want to campaign for the elections. Dude, I'm a lecturer now! Oops, sorry. Ok guys, listen up... Dude, look at Karna's party symbol...it's the last bench! Shows the standards of the Mechanical boys! But we are Computer Science boys our symbol should be of corporate standards. What about an apple? They'll think we've copied a brand Dude, what about a pineapple? What a brilliant idea! Colouriul personalities are now set to become leaders in white Speeches are on the tip our tongues Pandals have been rented As we sit inside smoking, we await the fruits of our labour So who are we voting for? The last bench party! Please vote for us We are not liers, we live by our word Get set to rejoice for victory will be ours. Worry not, we might be in the ruling seat, but the rules will be yours It's so cold...warm yourselves... Move! karna, where are you going?? Ok, Loki is definitely winning this election. He's been gone for three days now. Not even answering his phone. God alone knows where he is! As though he's done this for the first time! This is what he does always. There have been times when he's come back after four weeks. But this time, ii he doesn't come back before elections, what do we do? karna, where were you'? Do you know how tensed we were? How could you go away at such a crucial time? It will be humiliating ii we lose this election. Dude, don't take this election lightly. The situation is quite serious. Do you know what Loki and his gang were up to in your absence? They've spread rumours that the candidate is missing even though elections are around the corner... Candidates going missing during elections is common Sporting sunglasses and wearing his attitude Let's be on our way and do the victory lap Without any distinction of grade or rank, come vote for us We are going to win anyway, so ready the cut-outs All of you sing it once again We belong to the last bench party We don't need anyone's permission for we are the rulers here Set the stage for us and keep the whistles coming for we are set to make our entry We've made our presence felt already Our attitude stands tall Silence please. The Last Bench party has won the election this time. Karna will be taking oath as the president at 10 am tomorrow. Greetings to all the students and the dignitaries present on today's occasion. Who's that...please maintain silence! I'll come to you, too. The reason such a massive crowd has gathered here is because a golden moment is set to be witnessed by you all. It's 9.45 am! Where the hell is karna? I request the party workers to not lose patience. He's on his way...friends, Dear voters, our beloved youth icon messiah of the poor champion of the environment karna... Where is karna? He'll be here any moment... What's up guys? Off to play cricket? Why? You want to join us? Play well. From the time of the Mahabharata, Karna has always been back-stabbed. On second thoughts, let's play the match. The swashbuckling batsman has arrived at the pitch. And he faces the first ball. Excellent shot He opens his innings with four runs. Wide ball...one run Scores a biggie. It's a six and the score card reads 10. Sir. It's 11! There was a wide. Total now stands at 11 Powerplay is on. All fielders are within 15 yards. A perfect setting for a thrilling game. Beautiful shot. Ball is racing towards the boundary and so is the captain. Failed attempt at stumping. The wicket keeper himself is stumped! Total score...37, 38, boundary...so 42 Defensive play by the opponents... Dismal performance by the skipper. Excellent dive that has stopped the fielder in his tracks. The ball has raced towards the boundary, the score stands at 46 What happened? And its a tailed attempt at a spin... The ball has crosed the boundary And the batsman reaches his 50 The crowd cheers him on Arial Four more runs while the opponent is run down The batsman nears his century, the presure is now on the fielders Lack of concentration leaves the batsman retired hurt just short of scoring a century Guys run! Give me a matchbox Give me a matchbox Look here, we've arrived at his room. Please don't keep blabbering. The situation is very serious. Please be quiet. Ok Show! You've lost. I came here to enquire Karna's health. I forgot I had to leave ever since we began playing cards. Please give this fruit to Karna, okay? Please stay Ghouse. What will you do going home? Sit down. How many times do I have to warn you to not steal glucose from the next room? That patient is low on glucose! Let's play another round of cards? This card looks promising This is a hospital. So you have cast the joker card itself? Is number 3 the joker card? He will definitely change I've made this carrot upma specially for you. Please eat. Please give it to me. Effect of the glucose! I'll make biryani for you tomorrow. You know how to cook m“; am'? Of course! And also kebab, brain fry, khaima balls... Bhagya loves the khaima balls made by me. Isn't it Bhagya? Oh yes! And from tomorrow onwards, she will bring you varied dishes... I don't think that's needed. He will be discharged by the time she brings biryani. I'm sure! karna, father has come! Father has come! Please convey my regards to him. Dude not my father...yours! Mine?? Yes and the principal has also come along with him. Huh, father has come! Yes, his father has come. I meant has my father also come? I told you! Not your father...but his! But you said the principal has also come? karna... karna... your father is here... Father...! Can I ask his father for the balance payment? Sir, look at how they've beat up each other! We don't need such students in our college. I've been observing him from the first year. Should have given him a TC and sent him away long time ago. Please take him with you sir. We don't need such students in our college. Even if I said no, you didn't heed to my words and left home to come here. Since his college is at quite a distance from the hostel, I bought him a Bullet last year. I thought let him study and not waste time in commuting. But what did he do? Our family is renowned... my father was a freedon fighter! But this fellow is good for nothing! I'll take him with me. We have a petrol bunk, let him till fuel there. How will he fill fuel? He's hurt his hand! I didn't mean it...please don't take such hasty decisions. Please advice him, he'll set right his ways. I don't think one dose is enough! You won't be able to understand this sir... Please don't worry...he's not bad in studies...always taking 60! 60 was in the old days, now it is 90 Upma is fabulous! Upma! We had upma even at our home today. Same taste! Hey, what are you doing here? Father! Your father? Arial There was a lot of leftover upma at home. I didn't want to waste it, so came to distribute it to the patients here. Come Bhagya. Let's go to the next ward. ...patients will be waiting. Please bless me uncle. Such a cultured girl. After all, she is my daughter! I didn't want her to be a spoilt brat at home, so sent her to live in the hostel. I don't like what you're up to. A decision has to be made today. Will you mend your ways , or do you want to keep bashing up everyone and become a rowdy? I'll mend my ways. Promise me. As a student representative of this college, I karna, would like to... Promise me... That I will not take advantage of the powers vested in me... I will sincerely live up to the responsibilities given to me... That I will not take advantage of the powers vested in me... I will sincerely live up to the responsibilities given to me... I hereby solemnly pledge to do all of the above... The match resumes in the home ground of the opponent Its the final delivery A mighty pull shot That's a six, The score now stands at Within half an hour of taking his oath, Karna has thrashed a student from another college. Please rusticate him from our college and take him down from the president's post. Such students spoil the reputation oi the institution. What proof do you have that we have thrashed someone? And what proof do you have to prove your innocence? We do. It's waiting outside. One minute. I'll call him. This is the boy who karna thrashed. Really?Did we thrash you? I don't know anything sir. But karna is a good man. He's lying sir! karna has threatened and brought him here! Don't be frightened of anybody. Did Karna beat you up? Be bold and tell me. I know sir, but I also don't know anything.All I know is that Karna is a good man. It that's the case, why are you wearing a bandage? Sir, I had come to your college for a fest. But then a girl... Father...! Sir, I don't know anything about her. Looks like she's also a good girl... Karna, promise me that you haven't beat him up... Sir, what's the big deal...of course, I promise! Father, no! Sir, don't trust these Mechanical boys! Excuse me, we are tar better than you Computer Science boys! What better? After engineering, you guys don't even get a decent job! Ok boys, please let's not tight about which branch is better. Sir, this is not a tight. It's a healthy argument. We Mechanical boys get jobs in the IT sector Mr Lokesh Kumar. Now let's see if you can do the same! Who even wants your job? All you do is saw with a haxo blade! So you'd rather sell tickets in black then? Look, that's a personal matter! What the hell is going on here? I don't know sir. They're all good boys. I wasn't talking to you. Boys, please don't fight... It's not a tight sir, it's a healthy argument. Why should we fight with Mechanical boys. We have our standards. What is the big deal about typing away on a keyboard? Sir, didn't we tell you that this is not a fight? It we don't get a job, we'll at least set up a garage. Unlike you guys, we won't put up a board saying “Get your PAN cards done here” and run a cyber centre! Even if we run a cyber centre, we will be relaxing in an A/C room With a couple of spanners , you can't turn your future around. You might be able to tighten a few loose screws in your head. Even if we hold spanners, we'll do a good job with it. Unlike you IT boys who will have to work long hours in an MNC, curse your managers and drown your sorrows over a drink at a pub. We belong to the Royal Mechanical club! Are you a Mechanical student No, Electrical. Then why are you supporting them? Because we supply electricity to their machines. We share a connection, so you mind your own business. Guys, please take her from here Come Ok, later later... Come come...where's Bhagya? Hello...you better know your standards...you can never raise it Of course we can! We'll even climb a building if we have to! We will construct that building... ah...l'm from Civil Engineering... thought I'll contribute something to the argument Even a mason can do that job! Please come... Hasn't Bhagya come today? Go bring her... it's been ages since I saw her it's been ages since I saw her You are the reason behind my beautiful dreams You have made your way into my heart Without my knowing, it seems like I'm ready to become one with you There I go, as my shyness takes over and I stand rooted to the spot karna is not nice...he's very short tempered The sun hides behind the clouds And when he comes out, he's capable of melting me Isn't he the one who paints the rainbow? The whole college fears him... Even if the moon seems luminous People choose to look at the dark spots within So how will they appreciate the divine moonlight? The words that I wish to say to you, remain within me yet... Just like the flower that awaits the arrival of the sun to bloom I want you close to me Without worrying about tomorrow I want you close to me For there are so many things to be said... I will flow into your heart like the cascading stream It'd be befitting if you engulf me in your ocean of love Follow the queue. What are you doing here? Get lost Can you please make this remote gas leakage detector project for me? Ok sir. 50% advance, Keep it there. What are you doing here? I'm looking. I'm looking at the menu. You are looking at it the wrong way. Turn it around. We too would have stood in the queue I'm sure! But you guys are VIPs... So I asked my boy to make you'll sit here What's the special treatment for VIPs? Look there. The guys in the queue have to pay a 50% advance. And VIPs? VIPs have to pay 100% advance. Because they are tough to catch hold of. Let this be ready tomorrow There's 40 thousand in this. Don't worry at all. For this amount, you'll get a fabulous project. Ok, let's go O dear heart of mine... You probably want to add more color to my life... Shy as a peacock, I'm now going crazy with your love I'm now forgetting my own self... I now smile to myself without a care in the world... There I go, as my shyness takes over and I stand rooted to the spot The sun hides behind the clouds And when he comes out, he's capable of melting me Isn't he the one who paints the rainbow? Even if the moon seems luminous, people choose to look at the dark spots within So how will they appreciate the divine moonlight? Just like the flower that awaits the arrival of the sun to bloom I want you close to me Without worrying about tomorrow I want you close to me For there are so many things to be said... I want you close to me, without worrying about tomorrow I want you close to me, for there are so many things to be said... I will flow into your heart like the cascading stream It'd be befitting if you engulf me in your ocean of love You will learn a lesson when you flunk your internals! Sorry sir, my car broke down. Your car broke down? My car wasn't moving. It wasn't moving? No...no! No sir..the car would start...but it wouldn't move Sir, I was able to switch gears, but the car wouldn't move. Nothing of that sort...the hand break was on... once I released it, the car moved Why are you leaving those blank spaces? Only if I leave the paper blank, will I be able to fill it in the night! Please take out Mahesh's blue book first. L 9on1! I'm glad I'll pass... 3 eggs are out Let it all come out... 4 eggs are out Where the hell are these boys? They went to go get the answer sheets and still no sign of them Don't worry, they'll come. karna, where are you off to? I'll go to Loki's room for 5 minutes Dude, sit here.

Since when did roosters start laying eggs? You do one thing. You make omelettes. Ok sir. But how will a rooster make omelettes Whoever makes an omelette, this is the way you should do it. Ok sir! Poor fellow, he's working so hard to make an omelelte. Why are you idle? Chop onions. Ok sir Ok,Karna is off again Karna, where are you going? Dude, I'll go to Loki's room for a bit Dude, why?

Dude, you stepped on the eggs! E9Qs?? Oh God, how do we make omelettes now? 1 egg came out, 2 eggs came out, 3 eggs are out, 4... I'm sure I'll get 25 marks! Bloody hell, can't even walk straight after some pegs... Dude...look there! (Peon is humming a popular Kannada song) I think the peon has seen us coming out of the staff room I'm sure he hasn't seen us...it's dark Of course he has! Had he seen us, he'd have definitely said Hi! I'm sure he's seen us Why worry about it? Let's do one thing. Let's ask the peon himself if he has seen us coming out of the staff room. Yes, yes. I think it's a waste of time... wait... if he had seen us, he'd have definitely said Hi! Come lets go The peon and I joined the college together eight years ago... we've been friends for eight years... had he seen us, he'd have definitely said Hi Dude, he'd headed to the principal's house! Ok, we are in for trouble..he's seen us for sure Confirmed? Yes! I'm sure he'd have said Hi if he had... Dude, where has he disappeared? I can't see him Girl, wait here until I signal you to come. I'll go check on the scene okay (Singing a romantic number calls out to his lover...) (She responds with another romantic line) Stay quiet! Tnis is the principal's house. Let's creep in quietly and kidnap him. Dude, is this your signal? Not this dude! I'll tell you. Dude, get down...l'll tell him. Keep your right leg there. Yeah, now left... Dude, how did you get in here? You get down dude Sir, dont trust what the peon says... Don't scream boys! I didn't say a word... What happened darling? I heard some noise outside Wait, let me go check Press the door bell. As soon as he comes, let's beat him up This is not college for the peon to arrive as soon as you ring the bell. This is the principal's house! You beat him up even before I could say Hi! Dude, is this your signal?? Not this! I told you I'll let everyone know when I do! Who's that? It's me the cat! Dude, here's my signal! Is that so? Ok Slowly be carefull Dude, look here! Dude, come here Dude, listen to me! Come fast! The peon... Don't even mention his name...he is a traitor! We should never drink again guys... Boys, would you like to drink some tender coconut? Ok, chuck it. Dude, this is bound to become a huge issue. We've kidnapped the college peon! What the hell do we do? Open the boot! What if he suffocates in there and dies? I won't open it. I'm not involved in this issue. I only drove the car. What the hell have we done? This is not a small matter. We've kidnapped our college peon guys! This is what I've been trying to tell you'll since last night... We've kidnapped our college principal, not our peon Narayana! Where's the principal? I clearly saw that it was him last night... when we closed the boot, it was the principal who was inside Guess he must have gone for his morning walk on waking up Ravi please tell us what really happened! I swear to god it was the principal..l remember clearly Ok, we were all drunk last night. Let's sit down and think calmly We began drinking at 7o clock last night At 80 clock, we went to the staff room to keep our answer sheets back Then we got a doubt that the peon had caught us in the act Then we followed him to the principal's house Mistaking him to the be the peon, we beat up our principal With this? Guys, let's go back to the principal's house, open the boot of his car and escape silently. Some passer by will help him. Dude, there's a CCTV in his house! I'm sure we'll be caught! We've kidnapped the college principal itself, you think getting hold oi the CCTV footage is a big deal? God knows where he's gone? He's never gone anywhere without informing me. Where do I search for him? I've never felt this helpless... Oh god, where has he gone? The camera is here, where's the footage? Even the CCTV isn't working! Mom... I've told him so many times to get it repaired. But he never listens to me karna! My dad has been missing since morning! Oh really?? Ok! Where are you guys going? We searched everywhere...he's not to be found Oh god, where has he gone?? He's even left his phone at home. Mom, please stop crying. He'll come back. Madam, have you searched for him on the terrace? We've already looked there. Except for papads that are drying there, there's nothing else. What if he's gone out for a walk? He's not in the park. I've already searched there. Did you check with relatives? All of them are useless..not one is answering their phone. What ii he's visiting some friends? We've asked...he isn't there Dude, you think he's in the boot of the car? In the boot? Did you search the boot of his car? Oh god, what are you doing here? Are you okay? Sir, wake up! Please be c areful How did you come here? Some people had sneaked into the house last night. When I heard the commotion, I came out to check. That's when they hit my head and put me here in the boot. Rascals, I won't spare them, I'll ensure they face the music. Loki. How did you know that the principal is in the boot of the car? So this is the mega project you promised us? What is it? So we are supposed to ride this and become milk vendors? This is no ordinary vehicle... it is multi purpose! In what way? It can ride on both land and water. Look here, in case of a flood, you can weld this frame and fit it here And this tube can be coupled to that hook there and tilled with air... thisn will help you stay afloat So it cost you 40 thousand for this masterpiece?? No way! This cost only 5 thousand. And the balance amount? I used the remaining 35 thousand to settle an old balance. Ghouse, no matter how much I repair it, it is networking. Bro, Ravi...hi! What are you doing here? I was just hanging around... No she wasn't just hanging around here. It was her idea to clear the balance of 35 thousand. Look, she even gave me a smiley. Here, eat some sweets. Here...take. I'm so happy that, my balance amount got cleared! Oh god, I have to go. ll I get late, they won't let me into the hostel. Karna, can you please drop me to the hostel? Go Karna, drop her. Poor girl! Ok, come on guys, let's drop her on the way. Why trouble the poor boys? They're yet to finish eating sweets. karna, that's right. We want to eat some more. You go drop her. Sit down boys Take a right here The college is on the left isn't it? It's already 10 o lock. No way they will let me in to the hostel at this hour! Come, I'll drop you home. If my dad gets to know I haven't gone back to the hostel, he'll kill me! OK, what do you want to do'? Let's go on a long drive? Are you crazy? I've been observing for the past two hours! Me, too! Where are we going now? Stop the car! Where are you going Arya? To enquire about an address Wait karna! Sir... Were you asleep? Don't worry, I'm not a cop. How do I get to Kanyakumari from here? Where to? We have a lifetime to get serious! Come Arya! Where are you going? You'll know once we get to the other side. Come. Hey, what are you doing? Keep quiet and follow me. Arya, the rope hasn't been untied yet! Then how will we find our way back if we untie it? We could've eaten this in the car itself! And you could've said the same thing in the car, too. Do you know why people go for candlelight dinners? When there's a power cut? No. Because the eyes become all the more attractive in the dark... Who's that over there? Ramanna, it's me Arya. VVhO Arya? The same one who came here last week. You even enquired about my health. I asked you what the hell are you doing here at this time? Are you crazy? What do you want? I wanted to know the route to Kanyakumari What?? Kanyakumari? Come here, I'll show you! I won't come! karna row faster! You wont come? I'll teach you a lesson! Arya, the boat is goin backwords! Do you know how to swim? Yes. I do I'm very hungry. What about you? No. I ate some fish on my way. I am hungry actually. But I don't have any money But you're not a cop..so then? You got to know that? Wait...don't run away karna, move“! Give back my money! Wait...don't go away... I've been observing for the past year... I've never seen you laugh so whole heanedly By the way, why is your friend Ravi after my friend Bhagya? For the same reason that you're after me... Aha! So you observe these subtle details! Whom is this parcel for? Uncle, I promise to return your 50 bucks! Wait, stop the car! Why? What happened? Please go and press the door bell of that house Am I crazy to go and press the door bell of a stranger's house? Din't I buy you breakfast? Now go get us some coffee Come in. Uncle...myfriend... Arya had informed that you'd be coming. Come in Would you like to have some coffee or tea? That's ok aunty. I've had my breakfast. You must be in the final year now, isn't it? Yes uncle The karna I had in mind to the one I'm seeing right now are poles apart. Saanvi has written a lot about you. That photograph was clicked when Saanvi was 4 years old. I've been more of a control freak with her than a loving father. When she passed away, more than the sadness of losing a daughter, it was the humiliation oi the manner in which she died that weighed on my mind. I tried shutting out all her memories. We even vacated the house in which she was born and raised. Even though I tried every method to satisfy my ego, my mind wasn't at peace. When I faced the turmoil of whether my ego is bigger than the loss of Saanvi, her diary answered my questions... Had Saanvi been there today, she'd have been 25. We've tried recreating all her memories in this room. No I won't give this back to you. Most pages in her book have been dedicated to you. She was trying to explore another side to you. Mummy this toy is broken... Brother!! You will not change in this lifetime! is this the only way for survival? There are so many ways to lead a dignified life. You have no dignity left, but at least think of the future of your child. If you keep entertaining men... Sister. Sister, I forgot to give the chocolate I got for your little one! I can't come in because I'm wearing my shoes Please don't miss my wedding...the address is in the invitation card. Please sit, brother Here, take this... Even though it's been four years since I gave up my old ways, my neighbours still view me with suspicion. Please don't feel bad about what you just said. It's okay... You weren't aware that I have started my life anew one minute...let me get you some coffee... I earn about 6 thousand rupees from doing household work... I'm managing with that money... Uncle, please open this wrapper... Baby, don't disturb uncle. I'm somehow managing to hold on with these earnings... but I have to admit her to school next year What's your name? How many cigarettes do you smoke in a day? Where were you all this while? I asked you how many cigarettes do you smoke in a day? I searched around for you...you weren't there...l came away... Dude, I asked you how many cigarettes do you smoke in a day?? Tell me correctly. Two packs Two packs?? 20 cigarettes. Even if it costs you 200 bucks a day, it will total upto 6000 bucks a month! karna, I have to tell you something. What? I'll tell you tomorrow. How did it land in your answer sheet? Sir, both Mahesh and I have written the same answers. Yet, you've given him 24 and 14 to me. Both of you were sitting in different classes to write the exam. How did both of you end up wiring the same answers? That, too word to word! Look, whichever word he has scratched out, you've scratched out the same. Thought it'd look natural... Your head!! Jnanesh, Have you read the article that sir has written in the college magazine? No! I haven't! In fact, that's the only one I'm yet to read. I told you...we've been friends for eight years. Look at how he came at the right time and saved us! He's amazing! What's up Sankoch? Ready with your farewell speech? Please include us in your speech, too. Don't forget that we were all thick friends at one point. So wasn't it you guys who locked up the prinicpal in the car? Did you tell him? Idiot! Loki and gang have been rusticated. They will not get admission in any college after this. As a friend, let me tell you one thing. Go and accept your mistake. Don't spoil their life. So our lives won't be spoilt is it? So you mean to say that it's ok for us to be in trouble? How many times have they got us into trouble earlier! Let them face it now. I didn't mean it that way. Please try to undenstand what I'm trying to say... Shut up! karna! Go and accept your mistake Karna. By staying mum, you're committing a bigger mistake. Because of you, your friends' lives will also be spoilt. Which friends? None of those guys are my friends These guys are my real buddies. Come lets go. Beat him up... Him and Sankock are both in it together... Where's karna? He was around here... I think he's gone back to the hostel ls it time for me to set sail on a paper boat? Has an unseen tear sat ensconced as a pearl in my eye? Can my heavy heart be unburdened? Is it possible to seek familiar shores? Will the path ahead look upon me kindly? And surpass my imagination? And also show me some love? It's 5 am as I'm writing this... one one side, the sun's rays are dipping and dusk is setting in... on the other side, the night brings a content smile on my face which refuses to tadeuu Only a few people can manage to bring a smile on other people's faces... I'm glad I met one of them...Karna... No matter how mischievous he may seem, there's an innocence in his eyes... While I set out to explore another side to him, Karna ended up showing me a whole new dimension to my personality As we mature, so do our thoughts... You start thinking that you're mature and can't afford to act childish anymore... We try to hide all our childish desires... Tonight, having been with him, I feel like a child again... On my shoulder hangs a bag of my memories A bridge made of a thousand unspoken words lies ahead of me The rains threaten to wipe away my footsteps I long to return to a life of innocence in your arms My heart is filled with generosity And I hope to now find my way home Unopened doors lie ahead New roads lies ahead Unspoken silence lie ahead 2.45 lakes? That's a good amount! We should not have taken our share back from karna, when he was going through tough times. We still haven't heard from him...will tell you when we get to know... Arial Where have you disappeared? The buyer is pestering me to take the payment and give him the car... Ok take the money and give him the car. I'll hand over the documents once I'm back. What should I do with the money? Open an FD An FD? In whose name? Madam, we need your signature here Sign here. Mom, when will you send me to school? Guys, his phone is ringing! Where are you? When did you come back? I'm in the hostel Alex: You're in the hostel? What are you doing there? L'm writing a letter. Will call you later. Listen dude, we're all at the auditorium Give this letter to Arya Karna, where were you all these days? Did it take you this long to shave ofi your beard? Ok come, everyone's waiting in the auditorium. What's that letter? Why the hell have they put the names of these boys? They've all been given an early farewell by the principal, dude! Four years! Sir, I've been here for eight years! I've been here for six years sir! You all must be wondering how those four years have passed by But the fact is that I know how each one of you have spent the last four years here. You all are set to become engineers and contribute your knowledge to the society. Just for today, I will spare you all and will not talk too much. Four years! We've spent the last tour years wondering, when we will we complete our course and get out of this college. But today, the day has finally come. And we want this college life to extend for a few more days.. I'm sure all of you are of the same thought I once recited a story that's full of sweet memories of college... carved on classroom benches and the walls of the corridor... we are still not satiated so many fond memories that I need to find new places to etch them... Let's quickly rewind the memories of the last four years... Two previous classes have already been mass bunked by us We are now facing an attendance shortage due to the lack of proxy The marks scored by us during exams are missing on our report cards But I'm sure we will clear a couple of papers during the revals The innumerable joys all these years have brought may they stay with us eternally We were with you during the good times. Now when you're off to face the music for the bad deeds, you want to do it alone? We've been seeing you for the past four years. Don't we know what you'll be upto? I've not included your names in this. It's only mine. All you have to do is add five more names. Thats it! Why did you guys bring your luggage? We are all extremely positive about being sent home! Then what about mine? We've got that, too! Give me that bag. I'll fetch an auto and load our luggage into it. You guys carry on with your talks. Come, lets go Arial What's that? Sir, apology letter Ok Sir, it'd be better it you could read the letter once You must've written that you were the guys who sneaked into my home and put me in the car boot, isn't it? You guys are in this college for the last four years only. I've been seeing students for the last 25 years. I've seen better students than you and also the ones who're worse than you. I've seen them all become responsible adults alter gelling a job. This is not a jail to punish you. It's a college. Sir, but I heard Loki and his gang have been rusticated... None of them have been rusticated. They must be in the auditorium. I once recited a story that's full of sweet memories of college... carved on classroom benches and the walls of the corridor... we are still not satiated so many fond memories that I need to find new places to etch them... Aren't quarrels a pan of friendship? Compromise and understand that in unity lies strength One or two strikes are essential in the name oi social cause Seems like our time in college will not suffice, so let us buy a site on the campus Were you the one locked up my dad in the car? Ermm...that day... You're humble enough to accept your mistakes... you're such a good person! Now go give this letter to the principal! To the principal? Why? You've addressed it to the principal, so go give it to him. lt won't be nice if I give it to him. It's addressed to the principal? Give it here! Dude, it this this your apology letter, Then what letter did you give to the principal??
