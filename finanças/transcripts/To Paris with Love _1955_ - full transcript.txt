Pretty good going, considering it's our first experience on the road. Thank you. But I couldn't have done it without such an experienced map reader. Thank you. This is the Champs-lysées. Thank you, Father. I have seen picture postcards of it. Even so, a milestone in every man's life is his first sight of Paris in the flesh. Indeed. That's why I wanted to bring you here. Thank you, Father. You should have seen this street on Liberation Day. I was marching a few yards behind de Gaulle with odds and ends of the minor brass. When just about here, a swarm of women dashed off the pavement and flung their arms round our necks. You too, Father? I was wearing the kilt. So they weren't quite sure. It's difficult to imagine you being kissed on the Champs-lysées. Well, I was. On both cheeks. By General de Gaulle. Another picture postcard. The Place de la Concorde. What a wonderful name. The Avenue of Elysian Fields. The Square of Harmony. It's in the small streets that you find the real poetry in Paris. [whistle blows] Street of the Donkey Which Limps, the Blind Alley of the Two Angels... Where in heaven's name is that? It's over there somewhere. [whistle blows] Everything is so beautifully proportioned. So symmetrical. Quite. [car doors slam] I say, are you all right? How can you drive so dangerously? You might have killed this lady! - Uh-uh-uh! - They nearly ran into me, you know. The English always on the wrong side of the street. I turned quickly like this, and she fell off. That is not so. - You acted like a lunatic! - Lizette! You murderer! Never again will I ride on that... - that monster of a midget! - You are out of your head, Lizette! You have gravely injured my friend. For two francs, I will punch you in the nose. Now, listen, do be sensible. - You will punch no noses. - You keep out of this. It was nothing whatever to do with... I have observed it all. Your papers, please. Are you sure you're not hurt? Well, I don't think so. But look at my stockings. How will I go back to the shop like this? Allow us to take you wherever you wish to go, mademoiselle. Oh, please, we shall be delighted. Well, I think I will. - Lizette, where are you going? - Back to the shop. Goodbye. - Wait, you can't go with them! - Yes, I can! - And on a real seat. - Make them pay you. They've caused you damage. I'll make you pay! One pair of stockings, 15 denier. [indistinct chatter] You are... you are... You are a jezebel! Oh, you hear? Now he calls me names. It's a good thing I have found out that at last his true character. - Is he your boyfriend? - Oh, yes and no. He lives near me and gives me a ride on his bike. And now where can we take you? Please, to my shop. It's Dusse in the Avenue Matignon. - Do you know where it is? - Yes. - Turn right here, John. - Yes, Father. - You're father and son? - Yes. Do you find it hard to believe? On a closer look, no. I have not known any Englishmen. I've never known any French girls. How could you grow so big and not know a French girl? Perhaps my son has led a rather sheltered life. It hasn't been too dull, really. It sounds dull. [laughs] Oh, we're nearly there. A very grand shop you work in, mademoiselle. Yes. Everything we sell is elegant, lovely, and expensive. If you come in, I'm on the first floor. My name is Lizette. Goodbye. And thank you again. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Charming girl. [humming softly] Makes one feel rather gay, a little adventure like this. Be your age, Father. - For you, I meant. - Charming girl. - Good afternoon, Pierre. - Good afternoon, madam. Excuse me. Ah, good afternoon, Sir Edgar. Did you have a pleasant journey? Most enjoyable, thank you, Pierre. This is my son. Monsieur. General de Colville telephoned this morning. - He expects you both for dinner at eight in formal. - Thank you. [Pierre] Henri, Sir Edgar's luggage, suite 34. [dog barks] Gigi! Come away from that saddle! You naughty girl. She simply adores the scent of horses. - And men. - It's rather rare for a Yorkshire terrier, isn't it? This is a French Yorkshire terrier. But of course. I say, not bad. Be your age. Pierre, who are those gentlemen? That was Sir Edgar Fraser, madam, and his son. Are they someone I should know? I really can't say, madam. That is always a matter of personal taste. I mean, is he famous for anything, the father? Oh, yes, madam. He breeds racehorses here. And so is one of the very few Englishmen who can afford this hotel. Oh, then you must send him to my shop. [humming] - This was a wonderful idea of yours, Father. - What? I'll be in uniform two weeks from now, trudging around some dreary army camp. Remember, that's not a foot bath. [humming] At least we don't have to dress for dinner. Is there any chance we might get away early? Oh, now really, John. Leon de Colville is one of my oldest friends. Besides, he managed to get a jolly good price for that stable we share. Anyway, the last time we met, you seemed to have a pretty good time with the boy, what's his name? Oh, Victor. He's all right. But I couldn't stand that brat of a sister of his, Suzanne. It's been so nice to see you again, John. You're much less of a brat than you used to be. Thank you. So are you, Suzanne. You remember how they always fought as children? Like cats and dogs. You would have thought that John was her brother, not Victor. I had to pull them apart every day. - It wasn't that bad, Victor. - It was worse. Oh, we were dreadful. Now I really must go. - Goodbye, Sir Edgar. - Goodbye, my dear. Goodbye, darling. Try to come to Scotland for the 12th. Oh, I would have enjoyed that. But I will be back in university then. Will you be in town again before we leave, Suzanne? I'm afraid not. There's so much to do to open the house for the summer. Goodbye, John. And please don't wait five years again. I almost feel as if we were brothers and sisters, don't you? Not quite. We'll see you out, Suzanne. Billiards? What did you mean when you said you were worried about the boy? He seems strong and healthy enough. Couple of years in the army can't do any harm. Do him a lot of good. It's not, Leon. It's... I have an idea that I've somehow neglected him. We're almost strangers. I'd like us to be friends again as we were when he was a small lad. [piano music plays] Thanks. You know, I never would have thought Suzanne would grow up to look like that. - Suzanne? - Hm. Oh, just a kid, of course. You've been in Scotland too long. Now that you are in Paris, you are in Paris. So you came to Paris to be alone with him? Part of it, yes, but also in the hopes that the boy might... find himself. You mean, to discover the facts of life? In a modest way, yes. He surely hasn't discovered them yet. Do you know I've never known him to go after the same girl twice, never? Sometimes once is enough. Not in Aberdeen. By the way, how did you get your father to bring you here? Well, that took a bit of doing. Oh, you know, subtle hints over a period of weeks. He really never knew when the idea hit him. Why didn't you save time, and ask him straight out? Well, you know how most British think about Paris. Anyhow, no father would ever believe we came here deliberately for his sake. For his sake? Is something wrong with him? - Everything. - You mean he's got something incurable? - No, there's still time, I think. - Oh. - When did it start? - Oh, several years ago. You see, Mother died, like yours, when I was quite young. Father never married again or even looked at another woman. As far as I know. He just retired to a dreary stretch of Scotland where we raised cattle. But it's a lonely life for him. After all, at 42 a man still has a few good years left to him. I'll be off on my national service soon. But first, well... I'd like to help him. To open life up for him somehow. With all his money? A castle in Scotland and a Drophead Rolls, he's lonely? I shouldn't think that women would let him sleep. You might be mistaken about all this. My father was. - Wasn't yours... - No. But I love John and I'd like to see him better adjusted than I was at his age. Well, in Paris in the spring anything is possible. Wait until he sees someone who takes his fancy. He did this morning. At the hotel. She was far too old for him. Then there was this girl we told you about at dinner, the one who fell off the motor scooter. Charming little thing, in a way. There you are. They should meet again. Do you know who she is? Her name is Lizette. And that's all I know about her, except that she works for Jean Desee, in the Avenue Matignon. Uh-huh. A stroke of luck. I know them well. We shall telephone Sylvia Gilbert, an old friend of mine at once. And get all the vital details. What do you suggest, Victor? Oh, he must never suspect what I have in mind. And if I may ask, what exactly have you? Well... I think she should be rather close to his age. Unmarried. Or a widow. With some money of her own, so she'd have no mercenary motive. - Agreed? - It's your father. Go on. I see her being reasonably bright, attractive... But she mustn't be too intellectual. He hasn't read anything since Gunga Din. Hello, hello? Oh, Madam's occupied? Then ask her to ring me back, please. Thank you. I'm sure she will help us. No woman can resist a romantic intrigue. [laughs] John would never forgive me if knew. He'd find it so frightfully un-British. Of course, if she's too French, that would confuse him. Any ideas? No. Not among my friends. They're all rather younger, I'm afraid. Oh. Oh, she mustn't be too young. Father gets sleepy very early. [phone rings] - Hello? - Leon, how sweet of you to telephone. - Hello? - It is you, Leon, isn't it? - Leon, are you there? - Oh, hello, Sylvia, darling. How nice to hear your voice again. Something wrong? Could be right. It's an old friend of my father's. She's not exactly old. She was not exactly a friend. I'll show you a picture of her. She's always in the glossy magazines. Oh, Leon, don't tell me you are bored again already? No, no, no, I assure you, it's not for me. It's for the son of a very dear friend. Well, all right, for your friend I will do what I can. But I still don't trust you, darling. And I have reasons. If you remember... Goodbye. There. You see how easily these things are arranged? Perfect. A widow, money of her own, no mercenary motives. Not too intellectual. [woman] Come in. - What is it? - Excuse me, madam. These are the patterns you asked for. Thank you, Anna. This was a lovely surprise. And I shall be delighted to have tea with you. It was kind of you to drop in, Victor. And to bring your charming friend. °-[buzzer sounds] -Yes? - [woman] Madam Davis is here. - In a moment. Well, we must go now. You are busy and we've got things to do. Goodbye, Victor. Goodbye. Until later. Goodbye. Then we'll meet around 6, at the Cascade? Good. - What's the verdict? - One, beautiful, but... - But what? - Isn't she too young for Father? She wasn't for mine. What are they doing here? I don't suppose your father had the same idea? That would never occur to him. Ah, there she is. Good morning. I didn't expect to see you so soon. Well, we were just passing, and I suddenly thought I must go in and see if that charming young girl is all right. - From the accident, I mean. - Oh, yes. I have a bruise on my knee, but I have new stockings. - Very pretty. - Oh, do forgive me. May I introduce an old friend? General De Coville, Mademoiselle Lizette... - Marconnet. How do you do? - Charmed. I say... Would you care to join us somewhere at tea time? Tea time, but I'm here. Perhaps we could arrange for that. You can? Well, in that case, I would be delighted. - Where? - Oh, shall we say at the Cascade, about 5:30? - Very well. - Lizette? This is the second time this morning, and I have just finished warning you. My dear Edgar, you have discovered a gem. The face, the figure, the spirit, she has everything. That was my impression. You run downstairs and I shall have a word with Sylvia. But you have no right to be so official! I have no right? This time, my girl, you've gone too far. I will no longer put up with your insolence. You are dismissed. Go. Very well. And where is this so-called friend of yours? - Downstairs waiting. - Really? Yes, I thought this little chat of ours might embarrass him. You know how shy these British are. Mm, not from my experience. If you are deceiving me again, Leon... No, no, Sylvia, you will meet him, I promise. He's charming, a great lover of France. A famous soldier. We owe him this littler service out of pure hospitality. Very well. The girl may leave early. - Thank you. - I will instruct Madam Alvarez. So you think it a mere nothing to be dismissed? No more than changing the bedsheets? Find a new job in a wonderful shop like that. Oh, please. All ugly women like Madam Alvarez are jealous of pretty young girls like Lizette. I know. I once had to leave the pickle factory in Dijon for that very same reason. [man] Mathilde, this is a father's affair. Oh, don't be so dramatic, Papa. He can't help it. He once played a footman in the theater for two performances. - Three! - Well, anyway, you were much better off driving a taxi. It is Lizette who is under discussion, not me. Well, Madam du Barry, what do you propose to do next, may I ask? I'll find something else. I have friends. Ah, like this fine English gentleman who caused all the trouble. What's his name? I don't know. But he's very nice! - And he asked me to tea. - Tea. That's how half the world's problems began. When the English invited someone to tea. - [phone rings] - I'll go. She should marry and settle down. But all Lizette wants out of life is a little fun. Yes? Nothing can ruin a girl quicker. You should see life as I see it. From the front seat of a taxi. The richer the man, the worse they are. Oh, you'd be in the backseat if you could afford it. And probably not with me either. Mathilde! I am a man of the highest possible moral standard. And the lowest possible income. It usually goes together. That was Madam Alvarez. I have my job back. A better job. I'll be on the main floor in jewelry! And she said I don't have to come back this afternoon. So I can go to tea. Hello, mademoiselle. How's the motor bike going? Oh, it's gone. Out of my life. Ah. Um... may I join you for a moment? Of course. Please. I'm expecting someone, but they haven't arrived yet. - Your father? - Oh, no, no. I left him. He's gone back to the hotel for a nap. Are you expecting someone? Well, I thought I was. Good afternoon. Hello. This is the friend I picked up in the... today - Hello. Picked up? - Yes. - I was sitting down. - She fell off a motor bike. I told you about it. Oh, yes, forgive me. Join us for a drink while we wait for our friend. - We don't have to wait, she's there. - Where? There. How did that happen? - Will you excuse me? - Of course. Please tell your father I'm here. - Hm? - We had a rendezvous. You had a rendezvous with... my father? Yes. Perhaps he'll remember. Won't you join us too? Ah, mademoiselle. - Good afternoon, Father. - Come and sit down, both of you. Your face is very familiar. It should be, madam. I work for you. - At least, I think I do. - [chuckles] Oh, so you are the girl! [laughs] But of course! [Lizette] Of course what, madam? Huh, shall we have a drink? Excuse me. Waiter! [Edgar] It's not very good, I'm afraid. We had quite a bit of mist that summer. But I adore Scotland. And you make your own haggis at the castle? Oh, wonderful. What is haggis? Well, it's, um... hm. Porridge meal and chopped onions and drippings and pig's blood squeezed into, um... a sheep's bladder. We serve it with bagpipes. Every Burns Night. - Burns? - "Wee sleekit cowerin' timorous beastie. Oh, what a panic's in thy breastie. Thou need not start awa sae hasty..." That's a wee bit of Robbie. - Wee bit of rabbit? - No, no, no. - Wee... - Wee... - Sleekit... - Sleekit... - Cowerin'... - Cowerin'... - Timorous... - Timorous... - Beastie. - [laughs] Beastie. - Oh... - Oh... - [both laugh] - What's all this about Sylvia? What's all this about Lizette? I don't know what you mean. You do know what I mean. You're trying to arrange something for John, and John and I are trying to arrange something for his father. Correct? It's too early to say if anything's correct. It's too late for us to stay here. [jazz plays] [music continues] They will never believe me at the shop when I tell them I was out with the boss herself. What I like about older women is, well, they're so much more mature. That's true, but do you regard me as old, John? Oh, no. Of course not. It's hard for a girl to compete with glamor like that. She has everything. All I have is youth. I imagine she would change with you gladly. You're sweet to me. [jazz continues] You're just the right age, Sylvia. Thank you, sir. But for whom? Oh, I wasn't thinking of anyone in particular. Just some sensible man who would really appreciate you. - Those are not so easy to find. - Oh, I don't know, they... There are some very nice older men around. - But I do not like older men. - You don't? - Why? - They have no zest. No joie de vivre. They have only money, and I am not looking for that. What are you looking for, Sylvia? Love. Just love. What do you think of my son? Oh, he's very nice. But he's just a baby. - Well, he's 20. - So am I. But boys don't grow up as fast as girls. It's much more interesting for a woman if the man is older. Really? Of course, one always hears that. Oh, it's true. That's the trouble with Georges and me. Young men are so considered, so sure of themselves. They don't know how to talk to us women. But they don't know how to listen. Do go on, please. Ah, here's one for you. - We can all get in. - Here is another one. There is no reason to crowd. You two take that one. We go together? Good night. It was fun. Good night. - Well, good night. - Good night, John. What address shall I give? [speaks French] I'm glad I fell off Georges' bike. - I've had a wonderful evening. - So have I. Must you really go home now? It's only a little past midnight. Well, my father is very strict about my staying out late. But I think it's all right for a little while. Splendid. What does your father do? Um, he's in the transport business. What's the matter? Do you know him? No. No, but he looks peculiar. Only a little homely, I'd say. Well, did you have that in mind all along? No. Not at first. You should have said, "Yes, my dear. From the moment I walked into your office." [singing in foreign language] [singing continues] [applause] - Are you waiting for anybody? - Not now. Good. Get in, my dear. I will not drive with that man! He's been following us around all night. But he may just have waited here. He did. He follows me everywhere. Come on. We'll walk until we find another one. Don't be silly! You can't walk all the way home. That's no way to talk to a lady. What we do is none of your business. Oh, yes it is. I know people like you. - You see, he's crazy. - Who's crazy? You should get a hiding for that. If I may say so, that is an absurd mustache. Don't let him talk you into anything! You hear me? He's the worst kind of Englishman! Hasn't even got an umbrella! [whistles] Taxi! It's no use. They're never free at this hour. - Oh! - [screams] My dear! I'm terribly sorry! Taxi! Well, never mind. We'll pick up one at my hotel. What I need more than a taxi is a towel. [laughs] The way to handle this is not to notice. - My key, please, 34. - Yes, sir. - Good night, sir. - Good night. - We shall be going out later. - Of course. - Wasn't that Sir Fraser? - Yes. - But he's all wet! - Yes. - So was the girl! - Yes. With his money, you think he could afford a dry girl. Thank you. We must get you home soon. Yes, we must. Soon. I like this very much. It's so peaceful here with you. How did you get to be Sir Edgar? Oh, I inherited the title. Together with... [indistinct] Castle. 30,000 acres, mostly barren land. [bagpipes playing] [Edgar] Wee, sleeket, cowran, tim'rous beastie. O, what panic's in thy breastie. Thou need na start awa sae hasty... [indistinct] Castle, the family seat. A colder, damper seat no one ever sat upon. When I was a young man, I went off to Canada on a hunting trip, looking for moose, and I met my wife. I did a bit of soldiering. That didn't last very long either. Lizette? Lizette? Hm? You mustn't go to sleep here. - Why? - You must go home. Why? I'm tired. [yawns, gasps] - Good morning. - Good morning. [drumming, singing] Good morning, John. What's that girl doing in the other room? Lizette? Oh. - Yes. - Oh, yes? How did she get here? She was wet. In fact, we were both wet. So I brought her up here to dry out. Did it take all night? John, you're talking to your father. I'm sorry. How do you think it looks, Father? I think it looks very nice indeed. What's more, she is. Now put your wits together and go order some breakfast. But Mama, I fell asleep. On the divan, why? Now, Mama, didn't you ever have that happen to you when you were a girl? But why is it so different if Papa had a sister? This gentleman has a son. All right, all right. Goodbye. Can't parents be a problem at times? Your father and I became very good friends last night. - Really? - After we left you, we ran into a very strange taxi driver. A ridiculous creature with a walrus mustache. - [John] Really? - [phone rings] Yes? Father? Will you take this up to Mr. John Fraser, please? - Yes, madam. - Sir Edgar, a Monsieur Marconnet. He says you will know what he wants. Very good, Sir Edgar. No, thank you, never mind. Papa? He's here? Apparently he's on his way up. - Oh, la, la! - Nonsense, Lizette. Nothing to hide. I'm sure the whole thing can be easily explained. You don't know Papa. He has a genius for making scenes. There'll be no scenes, Lizette. [doorbell buzzes] Leave this to me. How did he find out I was here? I wouldn't know. Good heavens. - Where is my Lizette? - She's there. Do come in, please. Good morning, Papa. [laughs] A pretty sight. I would like you to meet my friend, Papa. Sir Edgar Fraser, his son. My beloved father, Aristide Marconnet. How do you do? Won't you sit down and have some coffee? I've had my coffee. I will not sit down. I will not acknowledge this introduction. I come here for only one purpose: to retrieve my erring daughter, who's been led astray by persons of evil intent. Oh, come now, Monsieur Marconnet. Things are not at all the way they may... Enough! There stands my daughter, undressed, in the presence of two strange men. Monsieur Marconnet, a water car ruined your daughter's dress. So naturally, she took it off. Then she fell asleep, and there is to it. - Ha! - Oh, Papa, you forget I'm grown up. Now, you've said your little speech, so do sit down and have some breakfast. There. You know, sometimes you're very much like your mother. - [smacks kiss] Sugar? - Thank you. - Croissant? - Butter? Thank you. You are father and daughter? Do you find it hard to believe? - On closer look, no. - [laughs] What can you do with a daughter like this? Daughter! You're no longer my daughter! You're no longer a Marconnet. Bravo! Speech! Don't worry. He's really very happy. He always wanted to be an actor. Really, Father, if you're going to lead a dangerous life, you must learn to handle irate parents. - Hello, may I come in? - Good morning. - Good morning. - The door was open. I hope you forgive me. I only dropped in to bring you this. It was such an amusing evening, wasn't it, John? - My hat. - Very pretty. He left it in the hall as we were saying good night. You really should have trained him better, you know? Would you care for a cup of coffee? Thank you, no. Excuse me, but I forgot my shoes! - Oh. - Oh! - Good morning. - Good morning. [Victor] Must have been quite a breakfast. You don't think your father was deceiving you about Lizette? I'm not quite sure. It did look sort of peculiar, but I think he was just being gallant. It may be so. But you and Sylvia, - how did that happen? - I'm still not sure. I was honestly trying to get things set up for Father when somehow we got paired off in the wrong taxis. And well, I kissed her. That's always a good start. - Fascinating woman. - Yes, that's what my father used to say. I'm sorry. Go on. We went back to her suite, and scrambled some eggs. - Eggs? - Then we listened to some music, - and talked about books. - Books? Yes. Sylvia's really very intellectual, Victor. - I was quite surprised. - I imagine she was surprised too. And I could see she was getting sleepy so I said good night and left. That was very thoughtful of you. Nice mover. Oh, I forgot to tell you. Guinevere's filly is doing well. [horse whinnies] - Will you have her in The Oaks near year? - I hope so. I was wondering what to call her. Lancelot was the sire. Why not call her Lizette? [horses galloping] Really, I don't see why a man of 42 shouldn't be allowed to fall in love. That right no one could deny you. But I thought you were trying to find someone for John. I am. John's still a boy. Best years ahead of him. Yes. And so is his father. So, you won't tell me where you spent Friday night. Why should I? It's no concern of yours. It's very great concern. - I love you, Lizette. - What love? Just because I stayed out late one night. Late, I don't mind. But at ten in the morning there is, you must admit, slight room for doubt. I had a wonderful evening, and I've done nothing to be ashamed of. Lizette, listen to me. I love you. And nobody's going to take you, without a fight. You don't love me. You love that nasty little bike. - I will ask you to marry me. - Yes, but I will have to keep my job. That's not fair, Lizette. I know I don't earn must as a postman. It's hard for us to walk all day. [laughs] You should try my job. To be standing still all day. No. I can't deny that I'm very fond of you. - But only as a sister. - I don't want a sister! I want you, Lizette. And I think you love me. It's that Englishman? He would marry you? I don't know. But he's... kind and gentle. In short, he's a gentleman. And I am only a postman. Yes, but you're a very gentle postman. Now, start that bike and take me home. Of course, what men of our age have to be aware of in the case of a young girl is that there are younger men. That doesn't arise. Lizette prefers older men. Told me so herself. It can arise. There's usually some persistent younger man in the background to where they go. Oh, yes, Lizette had one. Terrible nuisance he was to her. She packed him off. With his tail between his legs. [bike revving] Hello! I want you to help me choose something for a friend. A good friend? I hope so. You'd better make sure of it. These things are terribly expensive. I'll chance it. Now, what do you suggest? I suppose she has everything but a diamond tiara. I don't think so. But I think she'd prefer something rather younger. Here's an idea. A golden whistle. If she gets into trouble, she can blow on it. [whistle blows] [whistle blows] - Do you like it? - Oh, I'd never use it. Then what? I had admired those diamond earrings. But a million francs. They're lovely. Let me show you how they look on. Very becoming. I hope she'll like them. Oh, she will. Now, if you will come with me, there is a little foolishness about payment. [chuckles] - Lizette. - Yes? Would you care to dine with me tonight? With you or the family quartet? - With me. - It's better. John has the car, so I'll call for you here at 6? A taxi? All right. But not the same one again. [lively jazz plays] [applause] [orchestral music plays] - [woman] John. - [man] Marsha. - [woman] John. - [man] Marsha. [woman] John? [man] Uh, Marsha. [woman gasps] John! [man] Marsha? [woman sobs] John! [man] Marsha. [woman sobs] John! [man] Marsha. [woman] John. [man] Mm-hm. Mm... [woman sobs] John... [man] Marsha. [woman] Oh, John. [man] Marsha. - [woman] John! - [man] Marsha! Marsha... [woman laughs] John! [man laughs] Marsha. [woman laughs] John! [man laughs] Marsha... [man laughs] Oh, Marsha, Marsha... [woman] John, John. [man] Marsha, Marsha, Marsha! [woman] John, John, John! [man] Marsha, Marsha, Marsha, Marsha! [woman] John, John, John, John, John! [man] Marsha! [woman sighs] John... [man sighs] Marsha... - [applause] - [Lizette] Edgar. - [jazz plays] - Lizette. John, you've stolen my clothes again. Sorry. We don't seem to have seen much of each other the last few days. - Doing anything interesting? - Not very. Are you? Not very. That's terrible. I wasn't worrying about Sylvia. I am worried about you. I don't want to see you hurt. Hurt? What can any woman do to me? My dear boy, we haven't time to go into that tonight. [clears throat] Sir Edgar Fraser. - We will deliver it at once. - No, thanks, this has to be signed for personally. What is the room number? Suite 34. First floor. - What about you and Lizette? - That's an entirely different matter. Why is it different? You're just as much too old for her. A man should be older, that's my point. Which way are you pointing, Father? Are you just being friendly, with Lizette? Or am I going to have a 20-year-old mother? - [doorbell rings] - See who that is at the door, will you? Yes? Oh, it's you, Lizette's friend. I am more than a friend of Lizette. Oh. Well, that's very interesting. So, what can I do for you? Stay away from her. That's what you can do. - Me? - Yes. You. You have no intention of marrying her? - Confess it. - No, of course not. Then I am warning you... leave her alone! Who is it, John? Hey! What's going on? Stop it, John! You! Break it up! Break it up, come on! Steady. There. Steady. Would you mind opening the door, please? We seem to have mislaid the key. Certainly, Sir Edgar. Thank you so much. Sorry. English. Hello, Father? I've got the house in perfect order. It's absolutely lovely here and I've done everything you asked. So please get down. Yes, dear. I promise. I'll come down on Friday afternoon. Oh, by the way, I might bring Sir Edgar and a young lady friend of his with me. Oh, good. And why don't you bring John too? He might like the cool of the country. That's very kind of you, Suzanne, but, uh, I'm afraid he would rather remain warm in the city. What have he and Victor been up to? Chasing after girls, I suppose. Well, just between ourselves, dear, John seems to have caught one. Oh? Is she nice? Have you met her? Why, yes. It's... Sylvia Gilbert. Goodbye. [woman singing in French] Good morning, Georges. What's the trouble? Brakes? No. Lizette. I ask you, Monsieur Marconnet, how was I to know it was the father? Wasn't it logical to hit the son? Of course. But it's not logical to be logical about women. I sent flowers to her this morning. With a note begging her to forgive me. I offered to take her on a picnic to Versailles. What more can a man do? Nothing. Except be logical. Wait here, Georges, I'll talk to her. It's no use. She's going off somewhere for the weekend. - Who with? - I can guess. Though her mother wouldn't tell me. Her mother? We'll see who runs this family. Well, look at them. Would a man give a girl diamond earrings if he isn't serious? But what is her serious about? Has he proposed marriage to her? Oh, Aristide, give him time. He has taken her out every night this week. You tell me to give him time. I, who have been without sleep. I, who have had to follow them every night this week. They say that the English are much more romantic on weekends in the country. Who is not? No, Mathilde, I will not give my permission. Unless they have a proper chaperone. Oh, Aristide, let us be practical. This is the opportunity of a lifetime for Lizette. How many girls in her position ever have a chance to marry a millionaire? - And a title? - I am a Frenchman and a socialist. I care nothing about titles. You are a snob. - Think of the money. - [door slams] Sh! Hello, Papa. This needs a little touch of color, I think. [horn honks] Here they are now! Goodbye! - Have a happy time, darling. - Thank you. Oh, you've forgotten your earrings. Oh. Goodbye, Papa. Don't worry, I'll be an angel. That's not practical. Just be sensible and don't catch cold. I'll try not to. Goodbye. [woman singing in French] And with my flowers. That's the kind of dog I want, Elmer. You don't think I'm gonna walk a thing like that around Wichita Falls, do you? Why, that's not a dog, that's a hedge on legs. That's the kind of dog I want, Elmer. Did you and Gigi have a nice walk, dear? It may have been nice for Gigi. Sylvia, I have nothing against her personally. But I will not go out with this again. She makes me look ridiculous. Darling, don't worry. You will see lots of men at the fashion show with little dogs like Gigi. Do we have to go to another of those? You know I only have two more days left in France. I will do anything you say, John. Pardon me, madam. Mr. Fraser, there is a telephone call for you. Thank you. Excuse me. Over to you. - Hello? - Hello, John? It's Suzanne. I heard you were leaving on Monday and I wanted to say goodbye. Oh. Well, goodbye. But now I have a much better idea. Why don't you come out here for the weekend with your father. Suzanne, I'd love to. Oh, but my father's gone off with yours on a two day trip to the battlefield. Oh, has he really? Yes. I'd like to come up for an hour or two. Um, might I bring a friend? Yes, of course you may. Uh, that was Suzanne de Colville. - Oh. - Yes, she asked us to call in at her place in the country this afternoon. - Why did you do that? - Why not? I wanted to see John before he leaves. But you knew he would bring Sylvia. - Yes. - You knew his father was here with Lizette. - Yes. - If anything happens, I'll never forgive you. It will. And you will. Now, come on, be nice. I know exactly what I am doing. I hope so. How am I ever going to leave you on Monday? By car, I suppose, the way you came. - Calais, Dover? - Sylvia, stop teasing me. You know how I feel about you. No. Tell me. I... I can't quite put it into words. That's a shame. But you must learn to talk about it, John. Making beautiful conversation is a part of making beautiful love. I'm sorry if I'm not very good at making conversation. But it doesn't mean I don't love you. I know about it more than you do. What's bothering you, dear? Just springtime? Paris? Youth? Don't say it's youth. Look at my father. I'll get it. [lively piano music plays] Let me do it, Edgar! No, not that branch! [Lizette] Oh! Well done, Edgar! Edgar, be careful now! That tree on the left! Do you want me to go and help? [Suzanne] Well, look who's here. - Why, it's Sylvia and John. - Hello, sir. How nice of you to come, both of you. - It was sweet of you to ask us. - Be careful! Who is that in the tree? - Oh! - It's Sir Edgar! - Yes. - Would you like us to help you down? Victor, perhaps you'd better fetch a ladder. [all scream] Edgar! [indistinct[ ...has been relieved! [murmuring] [muttering] ...quite all right. Nothing to worry about at all. There's nothing to worry about. - There you go. - Thank you. [gasping] - [clears throat] - Are you all right now, Edgar? Yes, thank you, I... I'm just a little dizzy. The heat and the... the badminton. Swift game, badminton. I thought you two went to the battlefield. Don't think this hasn't been one. Perhaps you should be in bed. You might have strained something. [laughs] I think so too. You do look a little strange. I'm fine. Never felt better. We will go back to the lawn. Will you promise to rest here for a while? I promise. Hello, John. I didn't see you at first. How could you? You were upside down. Please... - How is he now? - He'll live. He's asked for whiskey and soda. - I'll get it for him. - Well, we'll team up - till we finish our game. - Don't mention games to him. - Not now anyway. - Would you like to see the rest of the garden? Why, yes. Excuse me. What's happening here? Can't you remember, Leon? It's spring. - But that's your young man. - And your daughter. It's a fair exchange, for old time's sake. It will soon be night. What's wrong, John? I was, about you. Dear little Suzanne. You're still the same little brat after all. - Why did you ask me here? - Perhaps it was destiny. Tell me, do you believe in the stars? Well, sometimes I read my horoscope in the Sunday paper and I suppose I believe in it when it's favorable. I have looked up our horoscopes. You are Gemini, and I am Libra. So you see? The stars have made us for each other. Here. This will do you good. Thank you so much. Thank you. Did you really hurt yourself? No. You must think me an absolute fool. What have you been thinking of me? - With John? - That's different. You've been good for him. I'm very grateful to you. Besides, I doubt if you ever took him seriously. Like I did Lizette. Perhaps not. But Lizette has been equally good for you. We are only foolish when we stop looking for love. You see, John, I love you. Suzanne... - Are you sure? - No. I'm not sure, yet. I can get used to the idea. No one's ever told me they loved me before. - Didn't Sylvia? - Well... The subject did come up during the course of conversation. You know... Anyway, that's all over now. It had better be. I have some very un-French ideas about marriage. Who said anything about marriage? Besides, I haven't said that I love you yet. Do you think you could, John? You know... I think I could. Brat. Lizette? Edgar? I have been thinking very seriously. About us. So have I. - But... - But what? Well, I don't know if you are, but before you do, I don't think you should... fall in love with me. - No? - No, Edgar. We have had very much fun together and you've been wonderful to me. But it couldn't ever have been. It was a beautiful dream. No. They may help you to remember me. I will always remember you. [horn honks] You don't think he's proposing to her? How will I ever get used to a 20-year-old mother? I don't think you have to. They were saying goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Will you please give my love to Suzanne? - Of course. My love to... [indistinct] Goodbye. Goodbye. [engine starts] Such a lovely day, I think I shall walk home. Will you take the car back, Victor? All right. Perhaps Lizette will permit me to escort her to the shop. Well, that will be very nice. Thank you. - See you later. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - [honks horn] - [honks horn] Was that for you? Or for me? [horn honks] Lizette. Georges. Perhaps I shall ride after all. Do you mind? Of course I do. But then... Father, before we leave Paris, there's something I'd like to confess. Oh? What's that? Well, I really picked out Sylvia for you. - For me? - Yes. My mistake. [chuckles] But how extraordinary. I picked out Lizette for you. My mistake. But I found Suzanne.
