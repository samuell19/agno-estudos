'Samson and the Treasure of the Incas' We've arrived... It's time to go our own way. Your $20,000, Mr. Nixon. 1500 miles and you looked after it better than a bank. Thanks, Samson, and thank you Alan... There's always work for you on my ranch. Are you really leaving? We're two vagabonds, Mr. Nixon, and there's so much to see. Saddle fever! All I wanted was a horse and a new horizon when I was your age If you're passing Pioneer city, tell my daughter Jenny I'm back. I'll tell her. Goodbye, Sam. He's a good man... You should stay, Jenny would make a good wife. Spit it out, what have you got against Jenny? Nothing! You're kidding! Only that you've dragged me behind her father for 1500 miles to see her beautiful eyes. And you would've let Nixon travel all that distance alone? Jenny is just a friend, like you are, for that matter. But I didn't start hanging around the kids in Pioneer City pretending I can't read. Careful, Alan, one of these days I'll wipe that smile off your face. What was that? I'll check it out, it's probably a hunter. - I'll meet you at The Silver Dollar. - Too bad for you... I'll shame you in front of everyone. Dance, damned Indian! If you don't want me to aim higher. Get out of here, and make it quick. Welcome back. I was wondering if I could still be of help? - As a barber or undertaker? - As a barber! Then hurry up, a wash and a shave... And some of that lotion that's driven all the dogs out of the city! You could have waited for me to leave, before making this place stink like a stable. Interesting... You mean me, or your lotion? Don't kill a possible admirer, Tex... Is that how you treat future clients, Jerry? - A harmless exchange of words, Ilona. - Sure it was... And Tex was just playing around with his pistol. You owe me a drink, Mr... Smith... William Smith. Better known as Samson. He just returned from escorting Nixon's cattle to the railway. I'll be damned, that's 1500 miles... You're entitled to that smell, and a good bath. - Pleasant journey? - Perfect... If you hadn't been here, ma'am, the trouble would've started here. - They're Virginian. - No, I don't smoke. I hope to see you at The Silver Dollar, or don't you drink? Quite right, but I think I'll come and applaud... - If you're the star of the show? - We'll be expecting you. - What does he do? - Who? Jerry Damon? He owns The Silver Dollar, and he controls the entire city. - The woman? - His friend. - Hot or cold? - Ilona? - How do I know? - Not her, the water. It's tepid. - And the other one? - A pistolero... He's Jerry Damon's shadow, a savage, a sadist... I have to put up with him, he's my best supplier... As you know, I have a funeral parlour to run. Chasing the children away from here as well... What do you want to do? Build another Silver Dollar? It's Damon's land, and the law is on his side. It would be the first time, sheriff. Jenny, your father will be back soon... Why don't you get him to buy this piece of land? - Damon isn't selling. - Have you asked him? - Yes, but... - But? He didn't want to be paid in dollars. Skunk. I'm sorry, Jenny. Goodbye, kids. - What's going on? - They killed Burt Nixon. Speak quietly, his daughter is over there. - Where? When? - Near his ranch... It was Alan Fox, and one of his cowboys... He wanted to steal the money Nixon was carrying. - Who says so? - That man there, Grizzly. I saw him, sheriff, he was searching the body... He ran off as soon as he heard me, but he can't have gone far... His horse was beat. Return to your seats. - It's the usual drunks. - Mr. Deprofundis isn't drunk... He's leaving in the funeral carriage. You finally made it. - Is my father okay? - He's waiting for you at the ranch. The children really missed you. I thought about the kids a lot, Jenny. But, you see... I wanted to tell you that... You wanted to tell me? - I studied along the journey. - Good! Let's hear how you've progressed... Come. Back to your seats, children. Children, Samson didn't forget about our school while he was away... Or you. Even a simple cowboy, when he's armed with goodwill... ...is entitled to live his dream. Jenny! Miss. Jenny, write it, a dictation... Shyness is a gift of the strong... But one mustn't exaggerate. Would you like to change, sir? Very well... One moment. Damned drunk, bastard half breed. Harlot. Music... Come on, girls. A questionable card player, but an excellent marksman... I'd almost suspect you have a pistol up your sleeve. You mean as well as my arm, I suppose... Or perhaps you're accusing me of cheating. What makes you think I want to do that? That's what you told the sheriff, he wants me out of town on the first stagecoach? Yes, tomorrow, on the Silver City line. Before someone disagrees with your method of correcting your luck. At cards, or in love? Fish... Some riddles can easily be resolved with a bullet. In the back, naturally. I wouldn't want to ruin your last night in Pioneer City... But I advise you not to miss the stagecoach. Hi, Jerry. - Why did you come here, idiot? - What are you afraid of? The sheriff will be gone all night. $20,000 - Any trouble? - No, but there will be... The sheriff thinks it was Alan who shot Nixon and ran off with the money... - They're looking for him now. - Just as I planned. Sure, just as you predicted, until Nixon's daughter arrived... With Alan's friend, some guy called Samson. - So? - They swear the kid is innocent. And the sheriff has promised, that after he captures him... He'll take him to Silver City for a fair trial. Trial... A trial could be dangerous, investigations, questions... Soldiers from Fort Apache. Grizzly... You've got to convince everyone that Nixon's killer should be hung up from the nearest tree. Whether the sheriff likes it or not. Get our men, and all the dregs in the city... In the meantime, I'll work on lawyer Dortman. No, leave through the stables. - He's up there. - I saw him... If he shoots, I won't answer for his life anymore. But he's scared, your men shot at him... How can he trust the law? I'm sorry but if he shoots, that's an admission of guilt to me... And you know how that ends. Give me ten minutes, let me speak to him. Okay, this is his last chance. Alan... Alan, it's me. Get out of here, Samson. Alan, listen to me... Surrender, and the sheriff will take you to Silver City... I promise you I'll find the real killer before the trial. - I'm your friend, Alan. - If you're a friend, get me a horse... And let me deal with this. Hold it! And throw down your gun. Castoro... Go back to the city, something stinks here, and I predict trouble. Okay, I'm going. I should have broken your jaw instead of leaving you by yourself. Why in god's name did you run away? I lost my head, I didn't want to be accused of murder. You did just what the killer wanted... Now leave everything to the sheriff, he's an honest man. Burt Nixon was a brave man, one of the founders of Pioneer City... And we don't want his killer to be tried in Silver City. Let's hang him! Jerry, I need to talk to you. El Puma, I won't give you half a dollar in credit. I'm ready to sell you the map of the Indian treasure. Still dreaming about that Inca treasure! If you believe in the legend, why don't you just get it yourself? It's a difficult expedition. Damon, I'll need men, tools, horses... Do you think if I could afford a well armed gang... I'd tell them about the riches hidden in those mountains? I wouldn't be El Puma for long. El Puma... I want to give you some information... The bank is despatching a case of gold on the stagecoach, tomorrow... Not much... But enough to convince me that I should join your expedition. When you have it. The sheriff's job finished when he captured Alan... And we should carry out the punishment according to the laws of the frontier. The ropes in Silver City are no better than ours! We've got him! Poor guy won't even have time to defend himself. We finally tracked him down in the hills near Coyote Creek. He let us take him like a little lamb. Tell them how much money he had in his belt. What do you know about the belt? I asked you a question, tell me. I didn't think a dog like you could talk... When I came in here you were howling something interesting... Grizzly is a little shy in front of strangers, I can explain... Grizzly saw Alan Fox taking the money belt off the man he had just killed. - Isn't that what you told me? - The whole damned truth! - Does that clarify things? - No... And I don't like interpreters, Damon... Especially when they improvise. I want your man to come with me to the sheriff. You're defending a lost cause, but the witness is all yours... You can take him away. Well, are you going to come quietly, or do I have to drag you there? I want you alive. Hold on, give me that gun... You're under arrest. I can protect you tonight... Before you demolish the entire city. You'll take him away after he's paid for the damage. I'm in charge around here... You make out the bill and we'll discuss it when I get back from Silver City... I have a prisoner to escort there. It looks like they want to spare you the journey, sheriff. I'm taking Alan Fox to Silver City, even if it means war... Careful, Jerry, sooner or later I'll find out who's backing those four idiots. Alamo, as a lawyer, I warn you, you're overstepping your duties as a sheriff... You're turning the entire city against you just to protect a murderer. I'm acting according to my conscience and the law. Go to the prison, I need to have a chat with these gentlemen. Samson can't make it to the prison alive. No, not this door, the other one. Thanks. It's the second time you got me out of trouble today... Why? Let's say I don't want to increase Deprofundis' clientele... Is that good enough? It makes no difference to me. So long. If he smells something fishy, he'll come out with the sheriff. Even better... We can send them both to hell! - You see the others? - They're under the porch... At least, I think so. Preston, go to the stables and prepare a good horse for me. - Shouldn't you be in prison? - Right, but the path is swarming with guns. - You want to run away? - I'm going to get the soldiers from Fort Apache. The sheriff is crazy if he thinks he can protect Alan from these savages. I'll fetch you a horse... and a shirt... A hanged man should at least look presentable. Your fee... You've done well. I shouldn't have helped you, Damon. It will be a massacre if the sheriff doesn't deliver the prisoner. The good citizens of Pioneer city, will get rid of a murderer... And they'll teach that meddling sheriff a lesson. - He's an imbecile. - No... He's an honest man who knows how to do his duty. Take his side, if you want! And I'll repay you by exposing the Gold River Mine fraud... - Selling weapons to the Indians. - That's enough. What's a man's life worth in the west? Sleep on it. You're the only lawyer in the city... We could come to an arrangement when Jenny Nixon is forced to sell the ranch. Are you listening? The fear might loosen his tongue, and we don't want that. Hey, lawyer, how about a drink on the house? Ilona... Right in the back. Fish! When I didn't find you in your room I thought... - You went to my room? - Yes. You're leaving, and I wanted to say goodbye. We might never see each other again. But, above all, I wanted to thank you. I forgot men like you still existed. Yet the frontier is full of gamblers and card sharps like me. Don't let them fool you, Ilona. You hear that? There's no place for dreams in this wild frontier. Go in, now. It's almost dawn. You forgot your bag. Mr. Fish. You've won the first round, Damon... But be careful, I might ask for a rematch. Sheriff. You can't leave me here... - I want to defend myself. - The law will defend you, don't worry... We won't feed you to the wolves. Nat... You can go. You're sending me away just when it's getting interesting. - I have so much to tell my sister. - Sheriff! - What's going on? - They killed lawyer Dortman. It's all above board, no one's going to touch you. You'll be released after Alan Fox has been hanged. Try it, and I'll have you all arrested for murder. I'd like to see the entire city in prison! Lock him up. Murderer! Bon voyage, friend. - Where's the sheriff? - They locked him in the cells. I saw you arriving, but I thought it was too late. This tie doesn't suit you. You wouldn't have got away with that in Silver City. - Do I have to go down there? - Don't worry... You'll only have to stay there until we find the real killer... At least you'll be safe in Silver City. Arthur! Goodbye, beautiful. Relax, everything's going to be fine. You made it, sheriff. I wouldn't have bet cent on you coming back. You must be thirsty, sergeant... And The Silver Dollar is open, you and your men... - That's enough, Damon. - It was only a peace offering. - Thanks, sergeant. - You can count on me and my men. They wouldn't be enough to imprison the entire city. I want the culprits, and I'll find them myself. - Shall I come with you? - No, help the sheriff... And keep an eye on Jenny, she's all alone in this world. - I wondered if you'd leave, Fish. - I was afraid I wouldn't be able to say goodbye. Hey, Puma, I didn't know there were undiscovered gold mines in Silver City. Castoro... Return with ten men, and hand over Alan to judge Blackman. Okay, let's do a rehearsal, 1, 2... No, that was terrible. From the beginning again... All together! 1, 2... L'amour, l'amour... The ace of hearts for Mr. Fish. Okay, girls, let's start from the beginning. The stagecoach takes the long route to Silver City... And they change horses at Brook Pass, along the edge of the stone desert. If you take the short cut through the red prairie... You can hold-up the stagecoach at Foster Station. We should do this before nightfall. Damned soldiers, I can't risk being seen outside. Remember! If Alan makes it to Silver City... Judge Blackman will investigate and we'll all be in trouble. And the others? They'll join him in hell. And I'd be grateful, Barracuda... If you can make sure Mr. Fish has an ace up his sleeve. Thank your wife for the hospitality she's shown Jenny We couldn't leave her all alone on the ranch... Jenny, it was a pleasure having you with us. Thank you, especially for the respect you've given my father. I'll go on ahead. What would I have done without you? If it's true, that the dead can see... Father would approve of our love. Knowing you're by my side. Forgive me, but you're the only one who can help me... They're going to hold up the stagecoach and kill everybody. Who? Where did you hear this? That's all I can tell you, a woman like me hears a lot of things in a saloon. - Where will they attack? - At the post station by the brook. Jenny, stay with Deprofundis. I've got to go. - Alone? - The sheriff is at Fort Apache... I can't wait. Sun God. Protector of the Incas... Your gentle bride Misia is nearing the end of her long journey... From the forgotten homeland of our ancestors. I, Inazumo, your humble priest... Together with your bravest sons... We will proceed forth to meet her and dress her in her royal robes... And for her who rides in this great stone desert... The white mare with golden hooves. Sun... Give us a sign that the bride who comes from Cusco is worthy of you. Let's get out of here. It could be an ambush. I've never seen the Indians send kids before. Come here, you. What do you want? What tribe are you from? - I don't understand. - This is a waste of time. Hold on, the kid speaks Spanish... Why? It's a long story. What's going on? Tell me, I'm a friend. - Do we have to wait for them? - What tribe do you think they're from? If you ask me, they're neither Cheyenne or Apaches... - That looks like a Mexican Pinto. - They're still dirty Indians. He wants our help... The old man he was riding with fell from his horse and it looks bad. Tell him the stagecoach isn't an ambulance. - Let's have a look. - You're crazy, I'm staying here. I wasn't asking you. Do I have your word? You do, Castoro. Just in case it's a trap. If you hear gunfire, leave immediately. Come on, Alan. The whites aren't evil, they'll help you. No one can help me anymore, Misia. I'm on my way to the kingdom of the eternal sun. Tell me, has anyone found out you're a woman? No, they think I'm a boy in these clothes. Remember, they must never find out. You're pure, you're beautiful... I fear you might come to harm. Now listen to me... I've watched the sacred condor fly... That will guide me through the golden pastures in the sky... And you will remain alone... But the great stone desert is close... And your kingdom is even closer, where you will arrive... Riding the white mare with golden hooves... He's dead. Let's bury him before the boy comes back. What strange symbols, I've never seen anything like it... A radiant sun and a condor. What a strange boy. Look. Have you ever seen anything like it? I can't make sense of them. Let me see. It reminds me of the ancient temples of Cusco in the Andes. Sure, I remember now... They're sacred Inca symbols, the Sun God and their messenger the condor. So it is true! An old squaw once told me that beyond the stone desert... Hidden in the pale mountains... A tribe of Indians travelled here from the south over a hundred years ago... To escape the Spanish massacres. No doubt they had a huge treasure with them. That's what the squaw said! But I don't understand why no one took the story seriously... And went looking for it? We already had enough Indians to deal with to go looking for more! You should know the area like the back of your hand... - What's your opinion? - It's nonsense... The usual lies from those damned Indians. But if you're so curious, why don't you question the boy? He was with the old man. Right? Castoro, there! - Indians! - No, they never attack in the day. Alan, I bet this is another surprise for you. They don't want you to reach Silver City alive. Let's try to make it to Foster station, we're better protected there. - Scared they'll kill him? - He's just a kid... - Why don't you shoot back? - You forget, we're travelling with a killer. Enough! That's just what they want. - We're in trouble. - It's me they want, let me go. They won't let us live, we're witnesses. Between the eyes! - That's the third. - We'll wait till nightfall. You've run you're race. You won't feel a thing. Where's El Puma? Castoro! - What is it? - He's dead... And the money from the bank has disappeared. El Puma! He ran off after he killed this poor guy, taking the money with him. That murderer shot him in the back. Perhaps taking advantage of when the shoot-out got more intense. Fish, search the area. It's too quiet. No one will get out of this trap alive, but you have to try. - Aren't you afraid I might run away? - Alan, I don't think you shot Nixon... If you die here, everyone will think you killed him... But you've got to prove your innocence. Thanks... But I'm not leaving you now. It's not going to be a picnic, son... You might die just a little before me, that's all. The horses are rested, you can try to get past them in the stagecoach... With a bit of luck you can reach Pioneer City and return with reinforcements. Well? There are only three left, what are you waiting for? Daybreak... Damon won't be happy with our losses. - How much gold in the safe box? - About a thousand dollars. Careful, Grizzly, that's Damon's gold... We need it for our business. Alan, go... It's time. The horses! Barracuda, take five men with you. Follow those bastards, they're heading for the hills. Get ready to jump on the horses. - Nice jump! - Didn't even have time to pray. Let's go back to Pioneer city, Grizzly should have dealt with the others. - It was the last shell. - Alan, and the others? - I'm the only survivor. - Alan is dead? No... Castoro tried to help him escape on the stagecoach, but... I don't think he made it. I have to be certain. I'll take one of their horses, wait here. - You made it, you old fox! - It was a miracle, believe me. - What happened at Foster station? - Only Fish made it out alive. And who's this? My good luck charm. I'll tell you later. Listen Alan, they want you dead no matter what... And I think I know who the gang leader is... But I don't have any proof I can show the sheriff. Well? If everyone thinks you're dead it's possible someone might talk... I'll make them talk. You understand me? Sure, Samson... What if I went to Silver City and handed myself over to Judge Blackman? You'd be dead before the trial begins. Just lie low and wait for me at Vulture Well. Are you crazy? I'll die in the stone desert. I'll bring you food and water, it won't take long... As soon as I unmask the killers I'll be back for you. And Fish? He's a brave man... He'll help us. Friends of that delinquent, I heard them say his name... Alan... And I saw that giant, Samson. - Is all this true? - As true as I'm the only survivor. We should have hanged Alan... Him and his friend Samson will be past the border by now... Leaving the bodies of Castoro, Bill and the entertaining Mr. Fish for the coyotes. I'm sorry... I'm sorry to disappoint you, Damon. Did you hear El Puma's story? That man told the truth. Don't let it get to you... Driftwood always follows the strongest current. - Your room is still empty. - Don't mind if I do. We need to talk. Don't let him out of your sight. Get down. This poor animal is condemned as well. I was crazy to listen to Samson. And you're twice as crazy to follow me here. You making fun of me? Well enjoy it... Because you won't be able to laugh when your tongue is swollen from thirst. Farewell. - Who is it? - Ilona. You're taking quite a risk. Jerry is too busy with his gang to think about me. - Why are you working for them? - Do you really think I am? I don't know what to think anymore. Do you know what they're planning? Find some lost tribe in the desert, massacre them and steal their treasure! - Who will lead the mission? - El Puma and Jerry... They're business partners... And it seems he has a map to find hidden water deposits. We'll stop this massacre. I knew I was right to trust you. No, Ilona... I had to pretend to find out the truth about Alan Fox, who the bandits think they've killed. And now they're up to something else... - When do they leave? - They're gathering tonight... It's a posse of fearless, bloodthirsty, rogues... They're meeting at Vulture Well. Deprofundis. Deprofundis! Are you trying to ruin me? The sheriff is looking for you. Are you trying to get me killed? - How did you get in? - The back door, where's Jenny? She's with my wife, and I have to sleep in this chair... - You know how uncomfortable it is... - Go and wake Jenny. It feels great to hear you call me William... I thought I heard my mother's voice. Listen Jenny, contrary to what you've heard around town... Alan isn't a fugitive, and he isn't dead, as Damon thinks. - Damon thinks he's dead? - Yes, and so do the rest of his men. I'm sure he had your father killed... But we can't do anything until we have proof. - I also need your help. - What do I have to do? Fish will make contact with you, and you'll let me know... I wanted to keep you out of this, but Damon is too powerful... - And I can't trust anyone else. - William, I'm happy to fight with you. I just saddled my finest horse; Agony. Yours had passed out. - You're leaving immediately? - I have to meet Alan at Vulture well... He'll die of thirst if I don't go. Don't worry Jenny, Samson knows what he's doing. Who could it be at this hour? - I've got a gun. - It's Fish, open up, imbecile! - Is Samson here? - He had to leave again. We must warn him immediately... Damon and his men are meeting at Vulture well. I'll go... Deprofundis, prepare a horse for me. Be careful to avoid Damon's men, they've already left... But his horses are slow. I'll keep my distance, I have a very fast, strong, horse... I'll make it to the well before them. - But what does this all mean? - I don't have time to explain now... Give this to Samson, it's all written down there. And tell him I've gone to speak to the sheriff. Good luck Jenny. The ace up my sleeve didn't bring me luck this time, sheriff. - Don't speak, Fish. - I have to... Alan... Samson... They're at Vulture Well... Damon is the killer... Samson has a letter that explains everything. We met too late... I warned you, you don't fall in love with a man like me. Are you scared of me? Then why did you sleep close to me? No, there's only a drop left. It's not enough... Drink. We can't stay here. Let's try to get back... We'll meet Samson with water and rations sooner. We're here, at Devil's Pike... It's the last stop for water before the great desert. - What about Vulture Well? - Almost always dry... But it's a reference point... We did well to send Barracuda and the others there... That's it... Five hours ride, and we get the first secret stash of water... Then all the way through the pale mountains... - To the Inca city. - And their treasure! And if there are too many of us to share it... Only the two of us will have water on the way back. Okay, Damon... Okay! Alan... I feel so tired... Don't be frightened, it's the snake poison... I'll be okay by sundown. No! He saved my life. Bride of the Sun God, only once can we pardon our enemies. And only once can we love. The boy... Where are you? Boy! Stop! - William. - Jenny. - What are you doing here? - I'll explain later... We must get out of here, Damon's gang could arrive at any minute. Here? What happened? And Alan? I can't find him. Don't worry about him, he's with the sheriff... We found him at the edge of the stone desert. Like the ones you read about in folk stories... An incredible sight. Don't let it get to you... It was a mirage. Maybe sunstroke. And the water I found near me? And this? I have to find that mysterious Indian boy. Or was it a girl? The one in the story of the white mare with golden hooves. I don't know. But now I think about it... The way he behaved, those beautiful eyes... The softness of his skin as I sucked out the snake venom... It makes me think she was a girl. Am I mistaken? Or are you in love with her? Eat! We ride at midnight... Misia, moon child... Your long journey is over... But before you ascend on the ancient Inca throne... And become the sacred bride of the Sun God... The people of the city of Orin require you to renounce all human aspirations. Misia, if you have made your choice... If your heart is free of all earthly love... Your journey will begin, that will take you from this world... To unite you with the Sun God forever. Sun! Here is your bride. I am here, Sun... I, Inca, am your bride. The Fire Demon imprisoned in our mountain has heard your voice. We must make the necessary sacrifice before he will allow the moon and the sun to wed. But he will not ask you for maiden virgins or your young... Attracted by the treasure our fathers protected from the Spanish conquistadors... White men have violated the great stone desert and they ride towards Orin... We will not fight them, we will aid them in their journey... Until they have passed the Golden Gate... Prisoners in the heart of the mountain... They will be the victims that the Fire Demon wants. Damn it! Hot and salty! It's a volcanic region, there's a sea of lava underneath us. Tomorrow we'll be at the mountains, Jenny... And this drought will be over. I have an idea Samson... I'll ride behind Damon's gang and look for one of their damned wells. - You want them to find us? - There are too many of them... It would be a massacre. It's better to die from a bullet, than from thirst. Water! The sun has driven him crazy. Water! Now do you believe me? It's a gift from the Inca boy. Let's think about the horses, we'd be lost without them. You hear that? I heard a woman laughing. - Woman? - Yes! You're crazy! You've been out in the sun too long... You're confusing coyotes for women. I can smell a woman from ten miles away... - Once, in Tijuana... - No! I've heard that one. Coyotes? Now who's been out in the sun too long? Damon. Look. I thought so; a tribe that lives so isolated like this can only be pacifist. If the women are as pretty as these, we'll save a couple, what do you say? Urpi and Usta have returned. Leave us. Speak. We did as Inazumo asked and left water for those who needed it... ...and food for the others. They will be at the Golden Gate tomorrow. Very well, Usta. You may go. Only Urpi will stay with me tonight. - Did you recognise him? - Yes, you described him perfectly... He drank and told his friends to thank the Inca boy for the water. Why? The Inca boy! There was also a woman. A woman? What is she like? Beautiful? I don't know, but she's young, with blue eyes... And hair the colour of honey. Is she more beautiful than me? Look at me! No! Not that beautiful, Inca! We're at the pale mountains... And if my calculations are correct we're two hours ahead of Damon's gang. Enough time to warn the tribe. We need their help to stop those bandits. But we need to find them. Where? Over there! Look! Here comes the second group of raiders... We'll unite these me with the ones who have already entered... We'll leave them to kill each other... And anyone who survives will be sacrificed to the Fire Demon. Open the door. Look, hoof prints. They lead that way. Yes... They all have horse shoes. They can't be Indian horses... I guess Damon got here before us. Jenny, it might be dangerous in there, don't go in. No, I'm not leaving you. I'm not scared when I'm with you. It's still smoking. They saw us and fled. I think we've walked into a trap! Take cover! Damn it! How did they get here? - Alan should be dead! - Who cares? Just make sure they don't escape, then we'll deal with the Indians. Let's keep going. Samson and Jenny are probably hiding somewhere. - I don't have many bullets, you? - None, I left my reserves in my saddle. Wait. Let's stick together. Two more dead. Poisoned. Let's try to get out of here. Barracuda, go on ahead. Alan. Samson. Stay here, Jenny. I'm going to have a look. It's my last bullet. I didn't even see where they came from... I had just enough time to shoot. Be strong Jenny. It's all over now. Let's find a way out. I can't breathe in here. We must be close to the crater of the underground volcano... Come on. We're alone, Urpi. You can speak. Inazumo has ordered that the men with the white woman are to be sacrificed. Urpi, you know all the secret tunnels in the caves... - You must bring them here. - My life is yours. We'll never escape from this trap. - Your pacifist Indians tricked us. - But we're in gold mine! Look, it's gold dust... Gold! No amount of gold is worth more than the sun! Damn you... Who are you? Can you lead us out of here? The Inca boy! Alan... - What's your name? - Misia. Did it protect you? Yes. But for how long? My friends have lost all hope. Why do you care about them? I can only save you! - But there's also a woman. - Who is she? Does she mean a lot to you? She's my best friend's woman. You can't just leave her to die. Everyone has to die. But not you! No, Alan... We'll escape together, you can take me to your people... Far away from my people, who I'm betraying. Who are you? The sun bride. You're risking your life! I love you. And I love you, Misia. I loved you from the moment my mouth kissed you where the snake had left its venom. Misia, you have broken your promise. The Sun God seeks revenge... And I will throw you to the Fire Demon. You will die with your friends in the hot belly of the mountain! We will once again put you to sleep with the smoke from the poisoned torches... So that tomorrow when you roast in the steam of liquid gold... You will curse your foolish dream of stealing the treasure of the Incas. Forgive me Jenny. It's all my fault. It's better this way, at least you won't suffer. The Fire Demon's fury is manifested in us tonight... In the torrents of lava, and craters of fire... ...that threaten the entire city. The Sun God is angry with us at the sacrilege committed on his bride... And has released the Fire Demon's fury on his people to punish us! But we will appease him. We will appease him with the victims... The white men have violated our kingdom to steal the Inca gold... Let them die in the gold! Inazumo, I want to be the first to die. As you wish.
