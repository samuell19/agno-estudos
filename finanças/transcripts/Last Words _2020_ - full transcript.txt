We live and die by the stories we tell each other. My story is about the end of humanity. Today is 20th of June, 2086. I am the last person on earth. There's no one left whose stories I can tell. So I will stop telling them. I have nothing to say. I simply was. I wasn't saved because of something incredible. I'm not the last because of special powers. I am just the last. My story starts two years ago. April, 2084. My sister and I escaped to Paris, from London before it disappeared into the red sea. Like everyone born at the end, We had nothing. We knew nothing. No parents. No learning. No past. No future. The last survivors in Paris moved from place to place, looking for cans, water, shelter. Ajube! Water! Food! "Of..." "Gah..." "Kah..." "El..." "Em..." What does this mean? "Up above the world, so high," "like a diamond in the sky." "Twinkle, twinkle, little star." "How I wonder what you are?" My sister was one of the last on earth to be pregnant. Maybe the last. I never asked how it happened. Because that didn't matter. With no food left we had to go out. To feed what was inside her. Animal. No. Dead animal. Girl. No. Boy. Animal. They opened up my sister. To see who won the bet. Then they left us on the ground. And walked away. Months went by after she died. The sounds of fighting, The sounds of anybody doing anything, all sounds slowly disappeared. I was the last person alive in Paris. But I only waited to be dead. I remembered... My sister wanted to know the secret of those plastic strips from Bologna. I left Paris in September, 2084. THE CALL SOUTH THE CALL Were the only people left in the world, the ones I could remember? Was I the last? On December 20th, 2084, I finally arrived in Bologna. Where are the beast? You... You wanna see the beast? I'm not afraid. No. No, I know you're not afraid. Ah! Are you sure you're ready for this? Hmm? Yep! Are you ready? How did you know alive? They are very alive. More than us. Uh, please, go away. There's nothing but an old person who wishes to be left alone. What is an old person? Did... These are film fragments. All over the Earth, people save film fragments they could. Like seed banks. Of course, the seed banks were useless without living Earth to plant them in. These, we could plant. What is the secret? How to do they move? Hmm. Ah, kids today: popcorn and a movie. How about a popcorn movie? What is that? Food! Before the cans. When there was nature. What is that? Kiss. As good as food. What was the reason? Pleasure. Like eating. How did you... When did you find out that you've got this, uh, cancer? Well, I knew for sure on, uh, St. Valentine's Day. - And? - I've been working since then, oh, flat out at, uh, strange hours, 'cause, uh, I'm done in the evening... Why did he want to spend all his time writing before he died? Don't know. Did he think it would make dying less painful? Yeah. Maybe. And yet we carry on, you know, paying our mortgages, doing our jobs, moving about, behaving as though there's eternity, in... in a sense. Uh... Uh, we forget, or tend to forget, that life can only be defined in the present tense. It is, is, is, and it is now only. And that now has become so vivid to me now. A plum... plum tree. Uh, it looks like apple blossom, but it's white. And looking at it, instead of saying, "Oh, that's nice blossom, you know," now, it is the whitest, frothiest, blossomest blossom that there ever could be. The... but the nowness of everything is absolutely wondrous. If you see the present tense, boy, do you see it. And boy, can you celebrate it. You should go now. - Go? - Yeah. Go where? Doesn't matter. Why should I go from here? You've been a great comfort to me. A last present. A surprise. Watching films with strangers was always a better way. But now... you should let me alone to die in peace, you know. It's overdue for me. Long overdue. I don't understand anything you are saying. You go on, young friend. Find out what's out there. Why not follow the call? Go to Athens. You know, I came here to dream the beauty of films before I died. And those films... ...the gift became you. But now you need to go. Go to Athens. See if there are other people there. Follow the call. Live. Live your present. I need to die. Alone. Here... this is... ...the last... ...luxury I could have. To die here al... here... Coward. Selfish, arrogant, self... No! No! No! No! No, no! Don't go down. Don't go down. Look at me, look at me. Just look at me. Open your eyes. Open your eyes... Keep breathing. Just keep breathing. I was born in what used to be called the Americas, where there were rivers, fire, woods, trees. It was paradise. And then I... made movies. I was in Los Angeles. But my last life has been in the north. North from here. Amsterdam. Until the great floods came, my companion, my three children and I, walked across the remains of Germany to. She died in Geneva. The authorities prevented foreigners, the alter mensch, from drinking more than one liter of water per week. I took the little ones and moved on, even though it was punishable by death to travel with three children. I remember their names. Marion. Pip. Dulcy. I remember their faces. Marion. Pip. Dulcy. Halt! Halt! You're free to go. Let's get outta here. All right. Once upon a time... - Why? - What? Why do you want us to eat? What difference does it make? Even if we live through tomorrow or next week... The only regret I have... ...is that I didn't have the courage to kill them before I had to leave them to die. I'm sure glad you're awake. Come. These are the... ...are the parts I could find. for the camera. The rooms where they kept the cameras all caved in. This is your call. To build a camera. The last film camera. For the end. However it will come. You will help me? No. This is your call. You will build the camera. [Shakespeare grunting This might help. So? So... - Iso alcohol. - So? Methane alcohol and nitrocellulose. So? Ah, you questioned three times. Now will come the miracle. Nitrocellulose. One, two. You know, if we're lucky, we have our miracle. Yeah... Easy. Atta boy. When it's dark, we apply the emulsion, and then we'll wait for it to dry, and then we'll see if we got our miracle. - Can you do that? - Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, I don't think you can. ♪ Hey, mamba ♪ ♪ Hey, miss mamba ♪ ♪ I want to have some fun ♪ We got 'em, we got 'em, we got 'em. Maybe. Oh, my God. Look at that. [chuckles So! We have just made the last batch of celluloid on Earth! Eh? And it was a miracle. You want to know why? - Yeah. - It's a miracle because I actually had no idea how to do it! ♪ Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee ♪ ♪ Woo-dee-woo-woo-woo! ♪ Oh, I'm dizzy. Here. Now, you can cut the film and perforate it. Do you understand what this is? Do you... Do you know the opportunity, here? Damn it! Do you understand that? This stock! This is an unwritten tablet. This is particles that hang magically in the air. And it's a last chance to leave a... a trace! A living trace, a testimony of us. Of us! It's our last chance to leave a living trace of man, as he once was. It's really important. It's... really important! Think about it. Think about it. January 21st, 2085, I followed the call. With him. And the projector, films, stock and unfinished camera. I still didn't understand why he wanted to bring them all. Or even why he came. If he had wanted to end his life. Before the end. Ah... Okay. But it's good he came with me. Okay, stop here. Stop here. Stop soon. Oh, God. Oh... Oh. We gotta remember that. How far are we? I have no idea. Far, far away. Phew. You know, it's like two kids running away from school and getting lost. Didn't you ever run away from home when you... when you were in school? And you'd get lost within a block? What is school? You're a complicated person to talk to. You know that? School is where you learn to read and write. And that's about it. I taught myself in Paris how to write and read. You did? Yeah. Really? Well, if we don't go, we'll never get there. Ah, thank you. You need to hang out with people your own age. You know... It's all digital dust now. They knew the collapse of the electrical grid was coming. That's why they started to make handmade film stock and manual projectors at the last minute. Now you have to build a real camera, a mechanical camera. ...and that tight. That's right, yeah. Good, good. Okay.. Now, on this side, we've got to create a... a spring mechanism. But you're gonna have to find a spring to make it work. - Maybe in Athens? - Athens? Who knows if we even get to Athens, especially me. I'm very old. And even if we do get there, what will we find? What do you think? I heard Athens was half underwater. Sea and sand, covered in 30 years. Oh. Earthquakes, famine, war took care of the rest. Aw, shit. - You all right? - Oh, yeah. Fuck. Ah, fuck. I can't make it any farther. No... No! Oh, it's what I thought! There's nothing left! Just washed over by the sea and sand! It was ridiculous to think that there'd... there'd be anybody here. Just ridiculous! The call to Athens was just someone's delusion! That people followed so that they could believe. Like you and your bullshit! You're the one who convinced me to come to Athens! Yes, I did. Because I thought you understood it was just make believe. Then why! Why did you do this? Because we need to invent something between birth and death. We used to call it killing time. I'm okay. Back it up. One minute. I want to see this. Twenty miles. The shore was 20 miles out. Now water. Soon it'll be over everything. So? All of Africa went underwater long ago. Africa doesn't exist anymore. Been underwater for a long time. Green! Green! Green! Uh... What? There's no more city. Just stops. - What? - Then all green. Green! - Green earth? Green? - Green! Where? There. Look at all of this! Green, green. Green! Green. I... Green. - Are you crazy? - Mm-mm. What are you doing? I'm eating. Oh! Oh, no, no. I'm okay. I'm okay. Nostalgia. Is it safe? Does it matter? I've never seen so many people together. Me neither. Not for 30 years. Hello? Nothing? Hello. I won't hurt you. Hello. Hey, hey, hey. Are they crazy? What's wrong... Why... Uh,? Uh... Uh,? Uh, salaam alaikum. Salaam alaikum. It's been a long time since someone offered me his hand. So, uh, how does it work here? You know, it... it reminds me of those 1960 communes. You know, the guru. Some leader always fucking it up. Here, there's no need for a leader. When you live only waiting for death, it does a great job of clearing your mind of bullshit. Yeah. Hello. - Oh, good. - Yeah. After the tsunami, there was a rumor that somehow plants could grow here again. I think that's where the call came from. - Really? - It went on for years. Whoever believed it, wandered around, calling it out. Some people came, some people didn't. But whoever's still alive is probably here. There's food, there's water. Help yourself. Everything that is green is like rainwater, it's toxic. I know. Yeah, we're experimenting with plants, but no luck yet. Can you imagine eating something that isn't out of an old can? But after so much loneliness... ...it's good to be together. Even if people don't quite remember how to do it. The green was a shock. Like all the people together. Together with no need to struggle. Was this how the world was before the end? Or are they like this only at the end? Waiting together only for the end. - Nice, huh? - What? You like them? How you were staring? No. It's that no one is afraid. Oh. Okay. Oh, there's an interesting one. Ooh. Pretty, too. Real pretty. Yeah? No? No? We can go this way... Oh, God. How you doin'? Even with the new pieces, it still doesn't work. What's your name? I don't speak. I am Batlk. And you? No speak German? Me neither. No, it's not that. It's just he doesn't know his name. Oh. Where did he go? Are you leaving town? What is this, a mobile home? I hope you're planning on bringing our roof back. Oh, don't be so pissed off. It'll be all right. You'll get over it. You're young. Only the old people get pissed off and stay pissed off, just 'cause everything's falling apart, you know? What films are you gonna show? I Love Lucy? How about Deepthroat? No, no, no, no. Stop. No, no, no. No... You, no. No, be afraid. No. No, no. No, no. I... I make you hard. You don't know. I know. What did you take from me? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Capital and Labor destroy each other. It teaches a lesson, a moral lesson. - It has social significance! - Who wants to see that kinda stuff? It gives me the creeps. Tell 'em how long it played in the music hall. It was held over a fifth week. Who goes to the music hall? Communists. Communists? This picture's an answer to communists. It shows we're awake and not ducking our heads in the sand like a bunch of ostriches. I want this picture to be a commentary on modern conditions, stark realism, the problems that confront the average man. - But with a little sex. - A little, but I don't wanna stress it. I want this picture to be a document. I want to hold a mirror up to life. I want this to be a picture of dignity! A true canvas of the suffering of humanity. - With a little sex in it. - With a little sex in it. - How about a nice musical? - How can you talk about musicals at a time like this with the world committing suicide, with corpses piling up in the street, with grim death gargling at you from every corner, with people slaughtered like sheep? Maybe they'd like to forget that. Died in Pittsburgh, like a do. - Whadda they know in Pittsburg? - They know what they like. If they knew what they liked, they wouldn't live in Pittsburgh. Am I laughing? What? I'm a surgeon. I know mechanics. Human joints, bones, muscles. Tissue, tendons. You're a witch. June 3rd, 2085. There were 397 people alive. This day they surprised me with the magic box. I was not really afraid. No, no, no, no. You take it. It won't bite you. Batlk neither. Won't bite you. Let me get my changing bag. This little box would change everything. Okay. For all of us. Until the end. Did they realize that? So, this is unexposed film. I'll thread it in the bag. Now.. There, that's all this. This goes in the bag. Okay, gate's open. I'm gonna spool. Okay. All right. There it is. You gotta turn that crank, remember. Yeah. You gotta hold it. Hold it steady. No, no. Wait, wait. Very good. Very good. Now, roll. Roll the camera. That's it. All right. Now go closer to her. Keep her in that viewfinder. That's it. You see, you see Zyberski, there? That's it. You got it. You got it. Bah! If you make the camera and shoot them, then they remain forever. For others, even after they're gone. Others? There will be no others. How do you know? But death was still there. It stayed in the strips after the people were gone. But maybe the old one was right. And life would also stay when the people were gone. If that's what I chose to film. Where are you from? Tell me. Stop. Stop it. Please, tell me your story. Stop. Please, tell me your story. Found these in someone's pocket. I don't know what it is. But maybe there's life in them. Yeah, we'll see. We can make the Earth fertile again. Maybe it will also be true for humans. Only plants matter. Not humans. Go, Dima, go! Bring our plants to fruition. Go, Dima, go. Bring our plants to fruition. Oh, what you looking at? Huh? Beautiful. Miracle like the Virgin Mary. You want to know who make baby with old lady. Who is the father? You? - No. - Maybe you? You? Could be you. Even you. There no one in the camp I no fuck! You are father. You are father. Water? Father. Me, mother. And father. I thought you said water. Only you make this baby. Baby. Thank you. Beautiful. So much for placebos. So, to what do I owe the honor of being filmed? Your story. I don't think you should hear it. There is nothing horrible I didn't hear yet. Please. I'm ready to hear anything. I know nothing but happiness and joy. I met Lena when I was 15, the most beautiful girl in Poznan. We loved each other from the moment we met. We swore to be together forever. But then the next day, we met Witold. And Witold and I and Lena, we loved each other for 40 years. How did they die? Die? They didn't die. When there was no one left in Poznan we decided to honor our time together and each one of us went in a different direction to spread our health as wide as possible. And then, and we lived happily ever after. Papa. Padre. You. father. - Me? - Yeah! - Me? - Yeah! - Oh. - Father! That would be my Of course the baby's mine. And it will be self-sufficient like me. Our only hope. You are a self-pollinating plant. Thank you. Please, tell me your story. You make me laugh. Who you think you are? The friend of the old man. Shakespeare? The old one. Shakespeare. I gave him the name yesterday. Shakespeare. Shake... Shakespeare. Shakespeare. Ok, I'll tell you my story. But in Italian so you won't understand. You wanna know my story? I want your story. My brother and I were born in Naples. We were the only children in our building who didn't die. My brother protected me. After a few years we heard the Call. You and I are the youngest people left. I'm 18 years old. That's my story. I don't know what you just told me, but that can't be it. Please. Please, for me. For? For others. Somewhere on the coast between Italy and Greece, We came across some people and they My brother. They put things in our mouth. And we ate. They called these things... food. My brother. They gathered plants and flowers. And they did it so delicately that it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen a human do. They never ate or drank without giving... half of their portion to the earth. Half of each person that they ate... they offered to mother earth. My brother. And they were able to believe. These people still believed. They were able to believe in something. And this is the story I tell my brother every day. Here. In this garden. Which is his garden. And I'm not ashamed. What?

We wanted to share all our stories. But we couldn't. Not enough time. Not enough film stock. So I tell only these stories. Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish! We're going to have a feast! A feast! We'll eat to our heart's delight. Fish. Fish. Fish. The last people who ate fish were also the people that destroyed them. They were also the last people with sperm in their balls. This is the first fish I've seen in 50 years. And the first bite should be for you, Batlk, for you and your belly. Fish and baby. Tonight I know there's reason to hope. Soon, Anna, your plants will bring life too. This is not the last of something old. It is the first of something new. Hope. Mm. Mm! You never know Press there. Feel the bump? It's moving. What's he say? Enough. October 1st, 2085. Batlk called it her 'birth day.' On November 12th, when a man arrived from Siberia, we were 212 people. He was the last to arrive in camp. So, it was just the spring that was a bit slack. But not the last to die of the coughing virus. Stop. February 3rd, 2086. We are 37 women and 22 men. And Dima. Spare us the horror of being the last. The horror of being the last person on Earth. The 5th of April. We are 40 people left. Everybody thought about who would be the last. Don't be afraid. June 4th, 2086. There are three people on earth. June 19th, 2086. We are two people left on earth. Before I die, I wanted to remember. Remember what? The greatest love of my life. And our two children who I love more than myself. I remember my other children that I loved in different ways. I remember living in America and England and making films. I remember the day I stopped believing that those films, any films would continue to be seen. You were wrong. I'm wrong. You know, the young always believe that. I remember my entire life. My father punching out my high school football coach. Amsterdam. A cold shoot day in. Throwing up at a Sex Pistol concert in 1978. God save the queen and the fascist regime. We mean it, man! I remember waiting... in Bologna for the end. I remember Zyberski. And Batlk. And Anna. The only thing I don't need to remember is you. You are here. By my side. Right now. The present tense. No, I... I was just laughing about something my father told me over 100 years ago when I was just a kid. No, no, no. I'm fine. Just let me laugh. You know, it was good it was you. I am the last man on Earth. There is no one of you who can answer me back. So, I will still film. I know that we live and die by the stories we tell each other. But no one can know the end of any story. Especially your own. Since no one can know the future. ♪ La la ♪ ♪ La la la la la la la ♪ ♪ La ♪ ♪ La la la la la la la la ♪ ♪ La la la la la la ♪ ♪ You better come home, Speedy Gonzales ♪ ♪ Away from tannery row ♪ ♪ Stop all a your a-drinkin' ♪ ♪ With that floozy named Flo ♪ ♪ Come on home to your adobe ♪ ♪ And slap some mud on the wall ♪ ♪ The roof is leakin' like a strainer ♪ ♪ There's loads a roaches in the hall ♪ ♪ Speedy Gonzales ♪ ♪ Why don't cha come home? ♪ ♪ Speedy Gonzales ♪ ♪ How come ya leave me all alone? ♪ ♪ Your doggy's gonna have a puppy ♪ ♪ And we're runnin' outta Coke ♪ No enchiladas in the icebox ♪ ♪ And the television's broke ♪ ♪ I saw some lipstick on your sweatshirt ♪ ♪ I smelled some perfume in your ear ♪ ♪ Well if you're gonna keep on messin' ♪ ♪ Don't bring your business back a-here ♪ ♪ Speedy Gonzales ♪ ♪ Why don't cha come home? ♪ ♪ Speedy Gonzales ♪ ♪ Don't ya leave me here alone Ha!
