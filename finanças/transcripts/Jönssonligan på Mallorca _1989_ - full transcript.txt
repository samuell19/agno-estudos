- You think it'll work? - Sure, it'll be a hit! That'll be ten thousand pesetas. Harry, bring the sign up. It's a splendid deal. All the Swedes'll wanna come here. - I'm the one who painted it! - Yeah, and it looks real snazzy. Now get down. - Hasta la vista, se?or! - Adi?s! Right, Harry, now let's go to the Playa? [BAR(E) UPPER BODY] Buy some cactus spirits! "Harry's life elixir"! 30 crowns a flask, or somewhere around a thousand pesetas. One sip for breakfast, fifteen for lunch, and you'll never forget Mallorca? Or remember it! The cactus seed extract also improves your blood circulation! Harry! What are you two up to? - We're selling- - Selling us this perfume, are you? - P?rdon? - Oh, it's P?rdon-perfume, you know. - It's got real cactus in it, you want some? - Ugh! - What kind of witch brew are you selling around here? - Come on, Doris, we're out of here. Haven't you paid yet? We can't; the waiter's offered a double-or-nothing bet. He'll guess which cup the olive is hidden under. Ah, I'll take this one. - Bravo! - Wow, it sure is refreshing to be here with everyone! - Well, almost everyone. Why, what do you mean? - Sickan? - Yeah! Wonder how he's doing in Sweden. - Ah, he- he's probably doing well, too. - As long as he takes care of my flat and waters the flowers. Yes, he probably does. Don't you think so, Ragnar? Well, then? Everything's timed? And prepared, down to the? Last detail. It's an absolutely? Perfect heist. We'll strike against the Ericsson Globe? The night before Wednesday, exactly at 24:35 o'clock. ~ That's brilliant, Sickan! - "Charles-Ingvar"! ? Thank you. I'll need a trapeze, four kittens, one dried orange, and 16 suction cups. I'll answer it? It's for me! No way? CEO Wall-Enberg? - Er? May I come in? - Yes? Of course. Of course! It was for me; you keep on working! So? What is on your mind, Wall-Enberg? I wanted to discuss a mission. - I see? That's unfortunate. - How so? Well, my schedule is packed for half a year. At least. Not a minute to spare?! - That's a shame. - "D'hommage." Otherwise I could have offered you a task at a very high level, internationally speaking? - ? And out of the country. - Where you believe I would be particularly helpful. - Precisely! - How unfortunate! ? Well, while I'm here, may I offer you some refreshments? Of course! Feel free. Sit! "No hard feelings!" "Faites vos jeux. Jolly Bob?" Would you like some caviar? Eh-hem? Here you go. Out of the country, you said? Right? You see, I have some issues with the police stationed by the borders? I'm not exactly unknown! - "Georg Billgren"? - Passed away ten years ago. That's convenient. ? And running reimbursements for you. Cheers! - Mallorca?? - Yes. It's a shame that you're so busy, Mr. J?nsson- Well, busy and busy? It's a matter of priorities, in my business as well as yours! Naturally. After all, Mallorca is always Mallorca! A Moric dance! ? However, with some? British additions? - Anyway! What is the issue? - A Franz J?ger-safe in Palma. - Billgren? - But of course! This way. This safe belongs to a Spanish-Polish cardinal? - ? Bulka. - It's "Billgren". Cardinal Bulka always participates in the daily ceremony at 22:00. That's when we strike! ? And that's 18,7 in pesetas. Damn, you know how much that'll be? - Sickan!! - You seem out of it? You know he isn't here. - There, in that black car! - Where? Stethoscope, talcum powder, gloves? Chamois leather? Finnish. Chamois leather from Finland? So sheep it can't Finn-ish the job. - 'sup Sickan, how's it going? - Hi, Sickan. - ? Pardon? - ~Vamos a la Playa~ ? You got a plan? - Do I know you gentlemen? Are we acquainted? - Look? It's me, Vanheden. And Harry! Dynamite-Harry! Oh right, now it's all coming back to me? It's the cousins! Ragnar, how are you?! - Yeah, I'm doing well- - So glad to hear that. And your little girlfriend, what was her name again?? - Well, Doris has- Right, that's what she's called. And you're? Getting along? - Yeah, things are going real smooth, we're pushing signs- - "Pushing signs"? - Yes, I paint them and Ragn- - Oh that's so interesting. How fascinating. And it's going? Well? So glad to hear that. - Hey, Sickan? - Eh-hem, "Billgren". - Pillgren? - Billgren. My name is Georg Billgren. He's working in Cognito, y'know. - It's called "Incognito". - Yeah, yeah. - Anyways, what's going on, Sickan? - Pardon? Yeah... I mean, when do we get into the picture? You? I mean? When do we strike? You've got a plan, right? You wouldn't be in Palma for a holiday, if I know you well enough? You do not. You gentlemen must have misunderstood something. - We just want to help out! - "Help out"?! Last time you gentlemen wanted to "help out"? ? Was when this little "stock market expert" put all of our winnings from our IKEA-heist in 22 000 Fermenta-stocks, then sold them for exactly- - nothing! - 58? Thing! I prefer working without any "help"? Have a good afternoon. Talc. Gloves. Stethoscope. Chamois leather? Curare. Anaesthetic. Fast-acting. Next! Next! Done! Swap the passports and call the police. Come on, then, hurry up and get the key! - Uh, maybe he hasn't brought it? - That's right, maybe he forgot it in Stockholm. It's pretty obvious he hasn't? Just hurry up, alright? And tell the "genius" I said hi! [Two minutes.} 's nice and cool in here. Think they've got any nice champaigne? ? What do you want? Y'know, Doris would like the key to her block back. Those flowers need water and stuff? And if I got it right, you'll be tied up for a couple of yonks... Or more. Uh-huh? You should have stuck with your friends? Uh-huh? Should've worked a bit closer to our level, you know what I mean? Yes, I know? - I'm worthless without you. - Yup. - A twit. - Yeah. I fail at everything I do! ? Nooo? Not everything, right? - You're not completely worthless, Sickan. - Yes, I am! No, you're not. - You're pretty good at plans, Sickan? - Yes. Very good, even. You think so? Yeah! - You're also very good! - We sure are. And Doris! Want us to tell her anything for you? - Doris? - Yeah? Should we tell her she's a wonderful human being? Would you like that? - Absolutely. - Then we will, Ragnar. - Right? Bye. Goodbye. - This ain't any good, Harry? - No? - He sure is useless sometimes, huh? - Yup? - But Sickan's always Sickan?! - Yeah? Hey? I have an idea. Follow me! Hi! J?nsson is on Mallorca? But behind bars! Be careful now, Harry. - But do you think this'll work? - Sure thing! Sickan likes bread, y'know. Right? Come on! - Get that photo! It could be something for Expressen. - Or maybe KU. Get on with it! - Oh, do you really need to use both of them? Yes, when dealing with you! - It's a special transfer. - Understood. "Detective Green, detective Green, to the information please?" Detective Green? Wait, that's me! We'll grab a beer at the bar! Follow me. Cheers, J?nsson. Aah, Lissabon, Lissabon! Right. Here we've got Doris' empire: zone-therapy and burns! - Burns?! - Yeah, it's a solarium! - She's set for life here, y'know. - It's a real gold mine? And I painted the sign over there! - And where are you two staying? - Here? - ? Right around the corner, that is. - This way! Doris doesn't want us to take up the clients' route. ? And I've painted this wall, too! Here's the entrance! There you go. Come on, take a look? Here's a little invention of mine that belongs to the plant kingdom! The cactus drops drip down just like this? And then, sim sala bim? That's how to brew "Harry's Sunstroke". Here you go! Have a taste! It's strong! ? Very! What, isn't that lad supposed to be serving time? Did he escape? - Oh, not at all, the other way around! - How so? - They'd made a mistake. - That's a pity. They thought he was someone else. And so he decided to come back here and mess things up. Right? - Even though everything was nice and quiet, Harry? - Yes? And now you'll be faffing about with all these maps and torches and God knows what? - And the flowers! Harry, who will water them? - Harry? Who'll take care of my apartment? Hey, we've got some stuff to talk about with him. Y'know, we haven't seen him in friggin' ages. - Check it out, a client's coming in! - There you go again? - Doris Karloff? - Uh-huh? C'mon, Sickan. Have a seat. I have been tricked. Kept in the dark. Been treated like a seventh-grade twit. They have exploited Charles-Ingvar J?nsson! And pulled me by the nose. Yeah, that's not the first time? No, but it'll be the last. The police claims that nothing was stolen from Cardinal Bulka. But I know that something is missing, and I know who took it! And who are they? Two Swedes? One is incredibly tall, and the other fairly short. - The tall one is? He- he is? - Muscly! Yes. But the- the small? H- He, he has a bright hat. It seems like they are working together. - The Lizard and Bro! - What? ? Your brother?! N-? No, the Lizard's? Yeah, I've seen them at the framer's, where they frame my paintings? - The Lizard and "Bro"? - Yes, and the framer's is over there. Harry! Would you help me out with something? Harry, sweetheart~? Harry, hang this up? Yeah, I've spoken to them! No, we won't have any issues! Goodbye! - What'd they say? - Yeah, what would they have said? I told them it would take the Spaniard bureocrats a week to get the details sorted. - So we have one week to find him. - Let's grab that one-armed bandit! It's not like he can go anywhere without his passport? OK? Where do we begin? If I know J?nsson, he won't settle for anything less than the most luxurious of hotels. And the French kitchen. The taxi's waiting! Here it is. The lights are on. Come! - There they are. - Yeah: the Lizard and his brother. The snitches? What are they doing? Follow me. The torch! "Gertrud Germann, antiques?" - Vanheden, you'll have to pick this. - Y'know, that's a Spanish lock; not my area. - Let's blow it up! - Quiet! I have a plan? We need to get the key. - That's Germann's antiques shop. - I'll get this done, Sickan! - The card? - No problem. It's all under control! - Exquisite pieces. - Thank you! - You speak Swedish? - Swedish, English, French? - My name is von Oben. - "Beauty expert"? My salons lie in Paris and Rome? Currently I am building a petit salon in Palma. For that exclusive handful that understands that extra something. And I would belong to that exclusive handful? Definitely, Madame, according to my judgement. It would be a great pleasure to give you a treatment for free. Purely as an introduction. - Ah, I don't know about that? - But I know, Madame. 2 o'clock tomorrow, sharp. I don't think either of us will be disappointed. - That would be terribly exciting! Now we've gotta hurry. - Same price as usual? - Yes! Thank you very much. See you on Thursday! Would you like a little help with the door? Don't be sad, we'll meet again soon. Would you look at that one! You just gotta fasten the bib a little and- - oh hi Doris! How's it going? - Just great. I'll take a break now! - Weren't you supposed to leave? - Yeah, it's 2 o'clock! - What about the exhibit? - Where they show the newest swimsuits at Playa Blanca? - Thanks Harry, I almost forgot about that! - That's what I thought? - Harry, knock it off. You could take the car. - I will! Pick me up in half an hour. Point B here. Over. Point A here, over! There's a Swedish yellow car with a sun on it, driven by a good-looking woman. Trace it. - Understood! - Over and out. - What a tiny place! - Oui, oui, Palma is very small? ? Not like Rome, that's big! There the salon is like a great hall. This is more of a- a small bedroom, if Miss Germann understands? Miss Germann? If you'd allow me? Henri, take out the ultrasound-massage. Terribly hard to find qualified personnel around here, but you have to start somewhere! - Then we've started. Does that feel good, Miss Germann? - No? Tr?s bien! Then we're on the right track. "One must suffer a little before the country is ours," as Napoleon said. - The bag? - Pardon? You want a rag? No! Where's my bag? It's so hot, I need a handkerchief? - Here you go! - Oh? Thanks. Harry? Open the windows. Well, Germann, let us continue. You seem slightly tense here, I believe? That's it. It's going well! There wasn't much to choose from here. Let's see... That's enough. They've got French entrecotes and it's cheap! Let's get in. Follow me. I'll fix it. Perfect images. This would be possible to accomplish. - Two millions for Bulka. - Two?! - The other 8 million? - You'll receive them once phase 2 is over. - There is much left to do, isn't there? - But we thought- Once phase 2 is over. That is all for tonight. This way, gentlemen. - Now what do we do? - Phase 2. It's outside! You know, the yellow car with the sun? There! Wh- what? It was right there? Heh, it's the sangrian. I remember when I was your age? - PM 165 370. - Which one? - The car's number. - Good! Then we've got him. No way! Seems like there'll be another party in the Swedish colony, boys. The finer parts, that is. "On Sunday we'll celebrate one of Palma's better known international profiles. - "The Swedish antiques dealer, Gertrud Germ?n?" - "Germann"! "? Germann, who turns 60 years old. "Miss Germann is, among other things, a conservator who studied at the famous institute Pontager de Vernon-" - That's perfect! - How so? Yeah, uh? Sickan bought a beret. A new one. - It's perfect for him! - You've sure picked a lively colour this time? "Coffee"? - No, not right now. - Yes please, gladly! Yes please? Gladly. We'll need a gift for Miss Germann? - Hi! Congratulations! - Thank you so much! - Isn't it wonderful? - ? What is it? - Cheers! - Don't push it, Harriet! - You have to stay hydrated in this heat? - I'm tellin' ya, don't push it! - Darling! - Thank you for having us! David! You're sweet as li- - Dude, it's like an eagle's nest, y'know. - Yes? But it's nice! - We're done here now. - 'Aight. - Morgan! - Gertrud! You could make it, after all! - All the best, Gertrud. - Thank you. And I have a little something for you that you may find very interesting? How nice! - So you still feel right at home here in Palma? - Absolutely, it's a charming place. - ? However, Morgan, this is actually Santa Ponza. - Ah, I see. - And you had no trouble getting here? - Everything went perfectly, thanks. Well, what do you think? Good? Very good. Good pictures? They are professionals. My client has already secured 50 million dollars? Provided the operation goes off without a hitch. It will. - Champagne? - Yes please. - Um, the ladies' room? - No, outside. - Hiya, Sickan. - Keep watch! Shh! - Where'd he go? - Sickan? - Where'd he go? - He just disappeared! Follow me. - . - Paljon lunta mutta ei taskulamppua! - The hell are you saying? - "A lot of snow, but no torch" in Finnish! You're an idiot, just get outta here! - Where's Sickan gone, huh? - Beats me. Maybe he's become Billgren. What, and gone behind our backs? He would never. No. But maybe Billgren? ? Yeah, we know exactly what he'd fucking do, that little rat. You know how he is? Right? That little shitstain!! Yeah, he's goddamn tiny. Ant-sized! Those guys are all following the same pattern: Napoleon, Hitler, Lenin? Feldt. Small Sickan-like runts, all of them. Despots, that's what they are! ? He's shortsighted, too. And he wears a beret! Disgusting guy! - That's the last time- - What? - Sickan! - Ragnar, there he is! Yeah, as we were saying, that's the last time we're ditching you. We thought you'd left in advance, y'know. - We lack the brains! - And the genius. Twits? That's what you are. Utterly worthless twits! The second I have my back turned to you, you start flinging shit at me! Who do you think you are?! I? Could have died!! What on Earth has happened? Who is this? Ow! Yeah, we almost? hit that old lady with our car? That's all. - Are you out of your minds?! - Scumbags!! - Come on, have a seat? - Alright? Oww? - There we go! Can I do anything for you? - Coffee? - Yes, I can get you that. That'll help! - Please, coffee!! And you? Running this old lady over. Who would do that? And it's all that "genius"'s fault, getting you tangled up in who knows what? Sheesh! Utterly worthless?! What happened, Sickan? Now let's drink some coffee? Wait, where'd she go? - She poofed. - What? - She poofed! - What a peculiar person? Forgot her hat, too! - She gave it to us! - What, her hat? Yes? What a peculiar person! - Didn't you have a client? - Oh, that's right! Sickan! Tell us already! Now let's see? Yes! It's registered at Dorisol. - What is it? - We have to get a map! - We've got one at the hotel. - There's no time for that, we need a map now! - Por favor... - Favor? They have maps as a favour! The lipstick. Germann has a specially constructed safe, which is connected to an electrical trap door. This trap door opens automatically, exactly ten seconds after you touch the lock, provided you entered the wrong code? And then it closes automatically again. - Clever! - It is Franz J?ger. This safe contains the key to the whole mission, as well as 8 million dollars to be paid to The Lizard and Bro when the mission is complete. - We'll take the safe. - Wasn't it stuck in the wall? ? Every inch of Germann's house is closely monitored due to her antiquities: It is surrounded by electrical barbed wire on all sides, there are security cameras and TVs, and nearly every window has a heat detector; nobody could ever breach this security system? Apart from us, that is. Beneath the trap door I fell through, there is a well which is five meters deep. At the bottom there is a hole covered by a large stone. Remove the stone and you'll find caverns and tunnels reaching out to the sea. We'll get in that way... And then up. It says "Calle" here, but it says so on several places? What'd I tell you? This isn't it! Look!! - Ragnar? - Yeah, what's up? - Why don't we just lay down to measure it? - 'Cause we need to measure the height, not the length or width! Goddamn, what a tiny geezer! Talk about a climbing plant. No? No-! We've gotta go. Creepis vulgaris? Well well well, what do we have here? Perhaps there's enough room for a little work-out? God, what a mess! How southern: beautiful facades, but gardens full of junk. Yes? But we like living like that! Oh? What's that hanging over there? - A grape bush? - Exactly: frutti di casa! Try one! - Anytime! - Right, we've seen what we came for. What? - We'll find our way out. - They were here just a moment ago? I have a plan, timed and prepared down to the last detail. We'll strike in the morning at exactly 5 o'clock. We need a rubber floatie with a solid bottom and a diameter of 80 centimetres. A watch? Uh, a rubber hose, two meters long? - Circumference? - 41 centimetres. We need a beach ball. And a watch, too. Oh, no? You can't trick Harry. Not going out in the waters. No... You'll never get me to step on that "pelledon"! - Get a grip already, Harry! - No! You need some style? - There it is! - No, you can't trick Harry however you want? - Get here! - Come on, Harry! No? not out in the ocean, you'll never get me out on the ocean! Get here, now! - Get your watch! ? It's exactly 07:16. - Exactly, Sickan. Right? You have 17 minutes. The water level is supposed to sink by exactly 180 centimetres, no more or less. Understood? - Sure thing, Sickan. - The pool is up there. - ? Hey, I think it'd be better if Harry- - No way! Never mountains, and never out in the sea? Harry is needed here. Now hurry up. Get the torch. Wait! Floatie. Beach ball. Floatie. Beach ball. The pool is drained through here. The well is over there. I'll take a look at it. Oh, so that's how it is? Yep. Yep... I'll put a fella here, then the water comes in that way. There. No, let me think? There. One second, two, three? And we'll do this? There? Right! Fire in the hole! Sickan? Hello? It's dangerous now? Sickan! - The tube! - Yes? What a fucking mountain! What a friggin' blast! Be careful, now! Now's the time. Come on, Ragnar! Harry! Keep blowing it up! - Let the air out in exactly six minutes! - Got it! Now we'll stop. Now let's see? Six minutes past? Recently. - Harry! - Then the time is? - It's tight. No worries. - Harry! It's all under control! Stop? - Stop! - Float on! - It's us. - The gates and door are handled automatically. Two stairs down, the first door to the left. I'll be waiting. There's? There's a lot left. What's going on?! Oh dear? No worries, it's all fine. The clock is moving? That was a friggin'? Great start. It's going well. No! No. No! Harry! Oh, it's leaking! Harry! More water! More! More water, Harry! What a slip-up! No?! Damned duck! That's beautiful, you know? Halfway there. Brilliant! Wall-Enberg and I will be waiting on the terrace. You should be here by 10:30. Oh bother? Would you look at that. Come on, you?! Uh-huh. Just as I thought. That's more or less exactly it, y'know. This is a crisis? Now the clock is? Now? Now it's late. Now those six minutes have gone. 57? 58? 59? ? 60! Now's the time! Darn, what a spray! Harry! - Not yet! - Sickan? Harry, it's too early! - When do you want the copy? - Now! It is inside the safe? Just a moment, gentlemen. This way, gentlemen. - And you controlled the equipment? - It works perfectly. - You got the best designer. - The most expensive. Quality has its price. Curious? The floor is wet. Must be the cat. - But you don't have a cat! - That's the curious part. - Oh, now what? - A stray pissed on this safe?! It's unlocked? - What is this? - Billgren. - Charles-Ingvar J?nsson! - That is utterly fucked up. That? Should be liquidated within two hours. Our pleasure. - Where's Sickan? - You should know, you went with him! Yeah, I shoved the knife in at just the right time, and then there was a friggin' torrent? I thought he washed out here! - Something's gone wack? We're outta here! - No? Not the ocean, never the ocean!! Get here, now! - But what about Sickan? - I'm outta here, at least! Now get here! ? Got any beer? What a light bastard! That guy won't be wetting Germann's safe anymore? Scarcely! - Maybe he's still up by the house? - Let's go there and check! I've cracked Wall-Enberg and Germann's plans. Possibly the grandest operation in criminal history? ? A bold, unlikely heist at the Cathedral of Palma itself! - What, they're gonna steal the whole cathedral? - No? its most valuable item beyond compare! - What's that? - The King's Cross. A relic? Gold and silver, decorated with gems and diamonds, estimated value: a quarter of a billion. It is forbidden to take photos of it, and the only images available are kept in Cardinal Bulka's safe. - And that's why they needed you! - Exactly. Germann used them to create a copy of the cross. How do you know all that? ? The copy is located in Germann's safe. They're going to swap it out with the real one. - How? - I don't know. - When do they strike, then? - I don't know! - Yeah, that's really promising. - Oi!! Don't you talk to Charles-Ingvar like that! That's not what he wants to hear? Not when he's about to say: "I have a plan"! "I? Have? A plan!" I don't have a plan? Yet. Nope! Please move aside, there's no time! - There are public toilets at Plaza Gomilla! - Quickly! - No: up the hill, then to the right! - Goddamnit, he left again! It's all pointless? - Now what? - We'll just have to keep searching! I have a plan. That's them! - They're gone? - Around the corner, yes. Keep calm. They'll return. - Yes, there they are! - Arabs? - No, it's them. - But they're the same height? The world's most valuable artistic relic is stored within this room? The invaluable King's Cross. I must ask all of you to put your cameras away. It is strictly forbidden to take photos in here. Any recorded footage will be destroyed. For security reasons, you may only enter the treasury in pairs of two. If you would like to take a look, leave the cameras here and form a queue? - They didn't do anything. - Did they change their minds? We'll return tomorrow, immediately after the cathedral opens. I have a plan. We will need ten metres of sheets, black rope, and a mannequin. Harry! Where have they gone this time? They've left with their torches again? Took the car, too. If it's not this thing, it's the other? Now they're here? Don't look! - Do you have any camera? - No. Move. Give me the cross. We're heading to the car. Bro! Where'd you go? Drive the exact route I laid out to you. Not a single car could follow us. - That's brilliant, Sickan! - Of course! Holy shit! - Fuck! Now what? - The wheel! Tempo! Drive! - Drive! - I'm already driving! Look! Turn that way! Dammit! You do the ropes, I'll handle the burner! Harry's done this before! That's right! Come on! Sickan, follow up! - Come on, Sickan! - Don't give up! No problem, Bro? The wind's coming our way. - Go to the side! - We can't! It's either up or down! Higher! What about Sickan? ? I'll hit the gas! We're lifting! - Higher! - I'm doing all I can! - Get him up! - Help out, then! He's stuck, you've gotta get rid of him, Sickan! Shake him off! There we go! That was a close one? Look!! - At what? - Mallorca! - It's so calm? - And quiet! How does one make this vessel land? Well, you pull on this, and then a hatch opens near the top, and then the warm air goes out, and then the balloon sinks. - Oh, that's convenient? - Yep, sure is! Sparklin' wine, Sickan! Look! - Hunker down! - Now I'm the one making the rules! - What a friggin' bang! - Brilliant, Sickan! - Of course? Cheers! - Woah!! - The hole! - Wait? What? - Harry, we're sinking! - Keep calm, we'll just have to light it up! - Wait, what's this? Oh! - Just do something! He took the gas slang with him. That's no good. - Then do something! - Such as? What? Hey? He's still hanging on under the wicker! No no no no, ow ow ow ow! - We're CRASHING, Harry! - No? How about we land now, guys? - Just keep squatting! - ? What? - Yeah, just do this. - Harry?! - Soften up your knees and follow my lead! We're landing now! That went pretty well! - Get moving! - Wait? W-wait for me! No, no, not again! - Brilliant, Sickan! - Of course! "La banda de J?nsson!" This is a non-smoking train? Finally! What a coincidence? Well, gentlemen? That's the end of this little affair. - Not quite. - Not quite? One little detail remains. Gentlemen, would you be interested in? ? Cracking the greatest antiquity heist in all of criminal history? - What are you referring to, J?nsson? - The heist that took place in Palma's cathedral, just a few hours ago. - We haven't heard of any heist. - No, and you probably won't! Unless you would like to negotiate? Let's call it nolle hosequi. - Horsetrading? - That would be another term for it, yes. You gentlemen ought to be used to such things. - So, what would the deal be? - The following: I can tell you exactly, down to the last detail? How it happened, what was stolen, where the goods are, and who did it. - It wasn't us! - And what would we do for you? Release us! What was stolen? This? The King's Cross. - They ought to be here by now. - Calm down, they'll come? They are pros, after all. Look! It's a bust! "Pros"? Persson has handed the King's cross back to the Cathedral now? Betcha he'll get the reward for finding it, too. ? Guess that's that. "Much ado 'bout nothing," as they say when you go off chasing wild geese! - Yes? At least we're free? - Sure, but dirt poor. Damn, guess we've gotta get back to work? Why don't you go to town, steal a horse cart and start ferrying tourists around, Billgren? Now now, boys, that's enough! Let's see what Harry can come up with to lighten up the mood! - A little surprise? - I don't want any sunstrokes today! Yes, I get that? After all, when we celebrate we usually go for champaigne! - From the cave! - What's that? Eight million!! - In pesetas? - Dollars, Ragnar? Dollars! - Harry! Damn, we're millionaires! Look!! - Doris?
