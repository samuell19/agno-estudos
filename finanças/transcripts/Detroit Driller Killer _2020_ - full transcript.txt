Detroit. Words don't do it justice. Anger, fear, desperation. Scum, villainy. Traces of a ghost of what hope used to be. We all just keep walking. We all just keep going. Looking right past each other, right through each other. Right through the stacks of clothes, right through the abandoned buildings. I saw someone get stabbed the other day. To most people, that would probably be one of the more traumatic moments of their lives. But I was too focused on my job and my girlfriend that hounds me all the time that I just looked right past it. Shit, I'm lying to myself. Part of me was envious. I don't know if I was envious of the guy stabbing the guy or the guy getting stabbed. Like maybe there is an end to all this, for all of us. Honey, I'm home. What's this? Oh Carol, come on. - Tomorrow. - You said - you paid this two weeks ago. - I got a meeting tomorrow. Tomorrow, tomorrow. You know I'm meeting with the producer tomorrow, okay. Really, tomorrow?

Suck my dick you motherfucker, you stay away from me! Who the fuck do you think you are? You don't do this in fucking Detroit! This is my town you sucking motherfucker! You fucking motherfucker, I just wanted to suck your dick! Whoa! Give me your wallet. Hey drill boy, you want a fucking piece of this? Honey, I think we should see other people. Don't take my friend. Kiss my black ass! We rolling? Thanks Bob. I'm out here on Detroit's lower east side where five murders were committed earlier tonight. The bodies have all been discovered in a five block radius. In what local residents refer to as the red light district. Authorities are unsure if the murders are in any way connected to that large crystal meth spill you may recall last week, two blocks from here. Four pounds of crystal meth were discovered in a giant pile in the middle of the park. Okay, so far there are no suspects as of yet, Bob, but the authorities are doing everything that can be done and they assure us that they'll have this horrible crime wrapped up in no time. This is Skip Donahue, reporting from Detroit. This is a FAX 12, special alert. FAX 12 has just obtained this exclusive video footage of a man seen running from the scene. If you can identify the individual on the security camera footage, or if you have any information regarding the large crystal meth spill, you're encouraged to please call the Detroit authorities immediately. Honey, wanna go for a trip? I'll help you pack your suitcase. Brothers and sisters, there's an evil on these streets. An evil and diabolical maniac killer. Amen! Who is looking for blood. A killer who's sport is blood. Who's favorite tool is a drill. Don't perish as the other folks have by not listening to the word that has been spoken today. You heard the word. It's your obligation to live and laugh. Yes brother! Yes brother, preach! Do not perish. Ever since I was a young boy, I knew that the Lord would speak to me. And he's spoken passionately to my soul. - Not just to me. - Yeah! - He's spoken to you as well. - Yes he has! - Preach brother. - But you haven't listened. He's requiring you to listen now. - I need to. - Please. - I will. - Understand, the word is for you to listen and heed. Do not end up the same pile of blood and gore on the floor. One more day will be one too many. We don't need anymore days of this. We need this to be the end. One of you can find him. One of you will know who it is. He killed me. It might be one of you. Excuse me sir, who are you looking for? There's no one out there. I thought I saw my girlfriend. She's dead. What do you mean she's dead? Look, don't fuck with me, man. I know that she's dead and you know it as well. Yeah. Let's, let's go, come on. Okay. How many have you killed? Five, six, three, 12, I, I, I. I'm like in and out, I kinda don't remember. I remember all of it but it's. I know one of them you killed. That girl, in that rubble and stuff. I was in the apartment right next to it. I watched you slaughter her. Oh I, I don't think I actually killed that one. Yeah you did. - I watched it. - Oh, okay. Well, I'm gonna trust you. Do you collect the body parts? No. Are you sure? You'd make a killing off of them. No no, I cleaned all the stuff out of my house. I don't. Do you sell the brains on eBay or like the stomach and stuff? Stomach's are very valuable. No. No, that's, that's a lot of planning. That's so stupid. Why don't you sell them? They're so much money. I don't think ahead. I, this is obviously all because I don't think ahead and I don't plan, I mean. Do you fill up your bathtub and bathe in the blood like it's a nice bubble bath? No, I don't have a tub, it's a stand up shower. Do you eat them or hump them? Neither! I don't do either of those. Did you fuck someone like Ted Bundy or something? Oh, that's no, no. That dude was crazy. Do you jizz on them? No! - Are you sure? - No, that's. Kid, are you fucking with me? Why do you think I'm fucking with you? Kid, you're blowing my mind. I know. It's crazy, but if you kill me, you would not be right here right now. Because I am you. Hey, why don't you kill that guy over there instead of me? If I wack these guys, you'll leave me alone? Yeah, I'll, I'll leave you alone, but make it bloody. Wait right here.

I just need to lay low for a little bit. I don't really understand why you would like, who are you? I need somewhere to stay for a while and I want it to be here. That, yeah but I don't think. Hello? You don't need to do that, that's fine. There's nobody else here. It doesn't really matter, you can't stay here. Like we don't know you. All right, dude. Like should I call somebody for you?

I have had the most fucked up week guys. You have no idea. I'm so happy to be here with you guys. Uh, the band. You know the band underneath the apartment? They were driving me insane and I'm trying to work and they keep playing the same song over and over and over and over and over and I. I, killed Carol. I don't remember doing that. Uh, I killed some prostitutes. I think. And then a little boy talked to me. And then I, somebody tried robbing my house. I don't even know if that was real. I don't know, I. And then I'm running around and some guy tries to mug me, another guy tries to kill me with a bat. And then I get home. And it's on the news, and they got footage of me running away. And so, I get rid of those clothes. And I get some new clothes. And then I end up finding the band and beating them to death with a wrench. I think I fucking shoved it down one guy's. It's just, it's been nuts. I think this is all good in a way. Because I was working on a script and the project got canceled, but I think this new experience will really help bring in a, invigoration, you know? Do you know what I mean? - Yeah? - Yeah. Nod your heads, you agree, understand? - Yeah. - all right. Yes. Good, I don't want to be misunderstood. Heavens, no. Yeah. This is really nice. I didn't bring this, did I? No, that's mine. Get up.

Uh, you know, had a bit of work. Yeah? What kind of work do you do? Oh you know, these days I don't know. What like, construction? Handy man type work? It's more like demolition. Demolition. Yeah, I do a little demolition myself. I used to be into creative stuff but now I'm kind of into taking it apart. - Oh. - Destroying it. Kinda like a vice. Something to just go and get your release on? - Yeah? - Yeah? Every artist has their own style. An artist, I like that. Yeah man, I just uh, I was ridin' around looking for work myself and I saw ya sittin' there with your tools out. You seem like you're a creative artist like myself. You know. It's like one day it was just there. And then you know one day, Carol wasn't. Yeah that's like me and the circular saw. I got one battery operated. Whoa. Yeah, it's really awesome. You know, every artist paints different. I, I just get really creative with my circular saw. I can, I feel like each piece of work is a masterpiece. Oh my gosh, so, you know what really set this all off is there's this terribly, terribly annoying punk band that practice day and night underneath me. Underneath my apartment. And oh my gosh, it was, - it was horrible. - Yeah. It was honestly some of the worst shit you've ever heard in your life. Over and over and over. Oh man, it totally reminds me of this annoying ass rap group that was in my basement. You're kidding me. No, I couldn't make that up. That's amazing. Yeah, so how'd you get started in this line? Years ago, I used to be a carpenter. My father taught me the trade. One time we were working on this job, we had a bunch of guys on it. One guy got hurt one day, and that's what, that's the tool he was using. This guys blood and guts were everywhere. - Wow. - You wouldn't believe - the sight of it. - Yeah. Everything about the situation just, you know, it just stuck out to me. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. - I bet, yeah. - It just, it just. Wow. Just really, really just relate to it. So this is like sewn into you. You got like a real origin story. Yeah, you could say that. Aw man, it's, it's great running into you. You get, you get a little lonely in this line of work. Yeah, I agree man. You know it's always good to meet new talent. Yeah, talent, I like that, I like that. I don't know if I have talent but, apparently I've got the drive. Everyone has talent. It's just, you gotta, figure out what your talent is. Hey let me ask you this, man. Did you get that at the All Tool Depot down on third? Uh no, I got this at this place at Gratiot. Crazy Tito's Hardware. Crazy Tito's! - Crazy Tito's. - Okay, okay. - Nice. - Whoa there. Yeah. Thanks. Oh, hi officer. I was oh, I'm just going for a walk. Not right now, sitting, but yeah. Oh. This? Oh this is, this is my sweet mother's raspberry jam. I, I got it on myself. I made a bit of a mess. And I was just taking a walk while the pie cools. My girlfriend? My girlfriend. Man, she packed her bags and got out right quick. I mean, it was like she was there one moment and then she was gone. But you know, she left her mark. I had to do a lot of cleansing, to get to a place where I felt all right on my own. Um, but she is a good kid, you know. A lot of baggage to be toting around, for me personally. Missing people? I wouldn't say I've been missing people. Uh, that's probably why I'm taking walks alone and sitting here in the middle of the night. But you say there's people missing? Oh, yeah I mean it makes sense. There's a lot that can happen in a city like Detroit. I would imagine the number of people that you don't even know are missing has gotta be higher. I mean how many did you say are missing, four? I got a higher count than four. Who are you? I already told this guy I don't know anything about any missing people. I don't have anything that's gonna help you out. So, I don't know what you're hassling me for. I uh, I'm just, I'm just a guy.
