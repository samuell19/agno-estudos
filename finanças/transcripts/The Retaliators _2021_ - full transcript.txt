When do the sins of a good man make him bad? I guess it all comes down to choices. They say justice doesn't come easy... in an unjust world. Sometimes... If you're lucky... evil can be destroyed.

It's the traditional Bishop family Christmas Eve dinner. Can we got the stuffy now? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go grab it, honey. - Dad? - Yes.

Don't be surprised if I show up to next week's service with blue hair, all right? Before we wrap up this service, I'd like to share a personal story that happened yesterday. My girls and I, we were out shopping for our tree. Picking up a few presents. Nothing like last minute, right? I leave Sarah in line to pay for the tree while Rebecca and I go pick up a few more gifts. We look back and we see a man has claimed our tree as his. I tried talking to him. Hey, pal, look... I'm not your pal. Sarah's eyes say to me, "Dad, aren't you going to do something?" So I did. I did do something. Merry Christmas. I know, I know. Not exactly a one liner worthy of Rambo or the Terminator. Should I have knocked him on his butt in the middle of the Christmas tree lot? Luke 18, verse three. Here is a parable about a woman seeking vengeance for a wrongdoer who victimized her and then escaped justice. "Avenge me of mine adversary." Day and night, she begs this judge. But Jesus tells us... "When a sinner goes unpunished, "he is only free from man's law." "When man's law fails..." "God's law prevails." So I leave you all with one last word to any of us seeking justice in a world where it's lacking. Trust not in the sword, but in the grace of our Lord. Anybody here? Yo. You here? Hello? Hello? Yo, hey, man. Yo. You in there? Yo! Don't touch my car. Fuck. Trying to give me a heart attack? You want to fucking go right now, motherfucker? Let's go. I was just fucking with you, man.

Sample the crystal. Start a working relationship. And Vic sends in his brother. - Otto... - Shh. I just got off the phone with their president. He says one of their guys, Arlo, magically disappeared. They went to the meet to look for him. You know what they found? His wheelchair, broken in half. All his teeth in a pile. You know, what else seems to have just magically disappeared?
