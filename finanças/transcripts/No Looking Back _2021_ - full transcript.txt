MINISTRY OF CULTURE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION KINOPRIME With the financial support of KINOPRIME Foundation MEDIA PARK PRODUCTION KINOPOISK HD online-cinema KION online-cinema Bitch, piece of crap, asshole, scum! "Dear Olya. Everything is ready for your arrival. Your troubles are finally over. You and Masha will never feel need again. I live in a small apartment. But I will wall off some space with a wardrobe. I think Masha will like it. But she might be too grown up for that. Let me know what you think." Are you still with us? I'm almost done. Just keep reading. "As for us, I hope you’re ok with the coach? But if you want, I can sleep in the kitchen at first. Until we get used to each other." Ease up a bit. She's almost a free woman. -Mom. -Yeah? Should I keep going? A full-size couch, TV in the evenings. A happy social unit. Is that how he sees it? Idiot. Before he knows it, you'll be back here. And then your daughter, too. Your whole fucking brood. People like you can't have normal lives. Why not try, though? Sure. Try, for your daughter's sake. Fuck, asshole, motherfucker! My daughter will have a different life. Yeah… Unlike your son. Bastards, idiot, shitheads! How's your gold cap, not too tight? Piece of shit, village scum! "We have both been through a lot. We have had our share of grief and misfortune. But I believe that supporting and inspiring each other we can start a new life. We can enjoy living again." NO LOOKING BACK Dammit! I'm still taking her! No, you're not! Put down the knife. What are you? Let's go! Where are you going? Stop! Masha, where are you going? Masha! Stop! Do you think an ex-con slut is a good role model? Olya! Shit! Fuck! She stabbed me! Me! Motherfucker! Bitch! Are you fucking mad? Why us? It's your lamp almost killed us! I can't walk so fast, I'm barefoot. Let me go. What's wrong with you? Okay. You're so grown up. You should've spent more time in prison. That would be one hell of a shocker! I imagined it all so differently… With a cake and a "Welcome Back" sign? Your rage… and what happened at grandma's… It's freaking me out. She's a dumb bitch. She didn't even want to listen to me. So what are we going to do? We'll spend the night somewhere. And tomorrow we'll take the first bus to the city. Do you want my shoes? No. Okay, I'm coming! Vera Pavlovna. We need to talk. Right now? It's late. It's okay. It won't take long. Okay, come on in. It's payback time. Do you owe me something? In your dreams! You owe me. What the hell for? For sending my daughter to prison for four years, you little shit. She poked my eye out. For what you did to her… be thankful she only took one. Is this why you're here? Then you should probably go. Olya is out. Really? That's why I'm here. So she did this to you? She took Masha, and I want you to bring her back. TEN MINUTES EARLIER Who is it? Is it you? -It's you. -You should cover that crap. Why did we come to him? We need help. Only if you don't fight. She's completely mad. You don't even know. I've been through everything in four years in prison. But it's my mother who stabbed me. It must run in your family. How is it? Okay. It's not really that bad… It's like you have a bleeding vagina on your shoulder. Some stitches would be good, but that’s not up to me. It's going to sting. We are leaving tomorrow. Where? To the city. Why? Masha will go to a good school. I'll find a job. We'll start living like normal people. What's wrong with living here? Are you serious? I personally would love to get away from the old hag. We'll deal with her… Why be so rash? You can stay here. -You just got out. -Don't be stupid. You know nothing good would come of that. I don't know that. Expecting someone? She took Masha, and I want you to bring her back. Listen… I'm done with Olya. I'm done with her. It’s too complicated already. Is this enough? Where did you get so much? She actually has the right. She's the mother. Mother? What a great mother. I still don't know who knocked her up… Do you? I'm sure she doesn't even know it. She has a cunt for brains. When I was taking care of Masha, she kept messing up with all kinds of scum. You were not even the worst I thought she'd smarten up in prison. But no! She wants to take her to a guy from letters. Do you think that's normal? What guy? The pen pal. I told you, she met him through correspondence. -Pen pal? -Yeah. She got hitched when she was still inside. Is she out of her mind!? I didn't know. How would you know? He could be anyone! Any nut or pervert. Has she ever seen him in person? And she's dragging the child along, too! He is a normal guy. He's a teacher. Divorced. Masha has health issues. How will she take care of her? He won't agree, right? I don't get why we came to him! Are you… Are you out of your mind? It's revenge for betrayal. Stop it, right now! It's too late. This is an advance. The rest when you get the job done. What am I supposed to do? Whatever you need to. Use your connections. All your time of disgracing the uniform should count for something. Vera Pavlovna! I want you to get one thing clear. Olya is not her mother. She never was. And she's not my daughter anymore. She has nothing to do with our family. And you, my dear, are as much to blame for this as she is. Scare her off. And if necessary, beat her up. Put her back behind bars… I don't care. You can even chain her up in your basement. Just make sure she gives me my child back! I'm done. I will help you. Not for the money. Though you did promise it. I always keep my word. I also don't like the idea of her going to live with a stranger. With a child! With a child, yeah. But we'll settle this ourselves, without courts and all that stuff. That's why I came to you. You did the right thing. Olya, Masha, come out! Come on, get out! Olya, Masha! Open up! Come on, girls! Is that… a pile of shit over there? Mom, are you even listening to me? How far along? About ten weeks, I guess. That's wonderful. You should get married. I guess so. Did you ever think that maybe… all this is not for you or something? Actually, of course, I did. But shit, this Tanya - she definitely won't have an abortion. What? No. I'm not talking about the baby. An abortion? Are you crazy? Don't you dare think about that! Shithead… I'm talking about prison. Maybe you wanted… something different? I don't think so. No? Everything's okay, right? Sure. What, am I not doing a good job? That's not what I meant. Anyway… I'm going, okay? Go. Hey, Mom? You seem a bit weird today. Fuck off. The fewer parties involved, the more likely we are to agree. So we should catch them before they meet with this… husband. We'd grab them easily on the road at night. So they probably went through… the woods. Did they teach you that at the academy or it’s your personal theory? What's with the mistrust? Really. Maybe they're just sitting in the neighbor's barn? What's the sense? They need to get out of here. Olya is wounded, they are walking slowly. And Masha is limping, her legs are different. -What? -One of her legs is shorter. Okay. I think they're around here now. Anyway, by morning they have to come out to the road. So we have three options. Here. If they really went through the woods, there's only one option. Olya knows her way around here, it's a regional highway. They can hitchhike from there. You never fail to surprise me. I'm coming with you. And I hope you'll surprise me, too, at least once. Stop! The letters… I lost the letters. They should be here. You are so dumb. What? How could you go to that one-eyed creep? Because of him you were in prison. Listen, things are more complicated than they seem. And your husband, did you really meet him through letters? Yes. His name is Andrey. Have you ever seen him in person? Of course, I have. Where? At our wedding. Oh my God, seriously? Is someone really expecting us or we are hobo now? Do you realize that Grandma will kill me? Masha, it's okay. Of course he's expecting us. I know what I'm doing. And what are you doing? You gave Grandma a bloody nose. We're somewhere in the woods. And I don't even have shoes! And where are my things, my clothes? I'll get everything from her. -When? -Someday. It's not my fault she attacked me with a knife. You just forgot what she's like. Be happy Grandma only stabbed you. Not so long ago she actually ripped out my tonsils, so… She did what? I said, she took out my tonsils. -You too? -You too? -You too? -You too? Yeah, when I was little. She's a maniac! What if she collects tonsils and eats them to live forever? Do you realize she never ever gets sick? Don't talk nonsense. It's not nonsense! You know there are guys who eat placenta or whatever's left after babies. Come on, placenta, keep looking. I think I found them. We have to keep walking! We'll hitchhike to the city. And Oleg will meet us there. Andrey! Andrey. You don't even know his name! Where the hell are we even going? You… Ouch! Do you see them? I don't see anything. Go check it out. Again? What is it? Hush. Masha! Masha! What the hell? A snake. Fuck! Okay, let's go. Let me take you back home. I can deal with this. No need for you to be riding around. You can? You've already lost them when you had them. That was back before we made the arrangement. When I see that you can do more than drink and beat women I’ll go home immediately. You're the one who came to me. Let's go. I'll kill that bastard, I swear. I just can't believe it. A snake! What? A snake! That's what I'll do to him. This is so fucked up. Why are you up? Just… Listen to this. "When I grow up, I want to be a big, strong guy. So I can become a guard and guard bandits and all kinds of criminals. Because everyone wants to catch them. But nobody wants to guard them. But my mom and dad guard them. And everyone's scared of them. People will be… scared of me, too." Grandma is feeling a bit nostalgic? Don't you think it's strange? What? That he's wanted to work in prison since he was little? Nothing strange about that. Our whole family works there. He wanted to be a rapper for a while, too. What if we shouldn't have gotten him a job there? Where else would we have gotten him work? My father worked at the prison, you, and me. Maybe that's enough? He could have tried a different way. What way would that be? I don't know. He's about to have a baby, it's too late to try now. That's true. Come on! Ouch! Camping gone wrong? Can you give us a ride to the city? It's nice to spend time outdoors, with the family. I'd love to do that. So you went just like that, without any equipment? We lost it. Do you want some? Take it. Guys, cops at 101st kilometer. Be careful. He's not visible. What's that? Just colleagues warning about patrol posts. So we don't run into cops. That's handy. More than you think. Give me your foot. Was it hard living with your grandma? Compared to prison? Prison was okay. Then you are lucky. Living with Grandma was hella not okay. She keeps coming up with more diseases that I have. Scared off all my friends. I even ran away once. She's great at destroying people's lives. Why did you decide to get me? You never gave a crap before. What do you mean, I never gave a crap? Well, maybe you did give a crap. But not enough to become fugitives. Stop talking nonsense. While I was in prison… You know, while you're in there, some things get clearer. I always loved you. I just didn't think about it much. I don't want you repeat my mistakes. Right… it's not like I'm stupid. And what, am I stupid? Do you know that my father, your grandfather, also did time? Grandma never talked about him. Like she never talked about me? It's okay, you'll have a good family. With that husband of yours? He'll be normal. I promise. As long as he's not worse than Grandma. Anyone listening to cop waves? There's an APB on some wounded girl and a kid. They might come out to the road. What did they do? Are they dangerous? Maybe. They said to report it right away. Are we there already? Where? I don't know. Where are we going? A traffic cop. So what? He has a radio. Why did he stop? Okay, ladies, it's time to get out now. So where are we headed? No particular place. We just decided to have a little picnic. Picnic? You don't look like the outdoor types to me. What do you think outdoor types look like? Well, definitely not like this. Anyway, there's an APB out for two people. A wounded young woman and a little girl with a limp. That's definitely not us. Are you sure? Absolutely. I don't have a limp. Do that again. I think you do have a limp. And I think I won't see another group like you two today. Let me explain… Don't move! -You're wrong. -Shut up! -Put these on. -Who? Who? I only have one pair of handcuffs. So guess which one of you is more dangerous. Fuck! Don't you dare! Yes, hello. Officer Komarov here. I have two people here. Yes, from the APB. At 101st kilometer. Sure, I'll wait. They are not far from here. They'll come get you soon. I told you! Why are you all such bloodsuckers? Who? You cops! All of you, no exceptions. Why is that? Didn't you date a cop? Yeah, and how did that end? I always cringe when I see a cop. You're supposed to help. But you cause more trouble than any criminal. Criminals at least have honor. What are you talking about? I mean, they have honorable intentions. First of all, based on the APB, you have reason to cringe. And not all cops are the same. There are decent ones. Many of them. Said the patrol cop. One of your "decent" guys is actually on his way here to… To kill us! What? The guy you just called. Do you know him? Yes. He's my ex. What does he want? He stabbed her with a knife. He cut me, yeah. Look. This makes no sense. He was paid to. He's not planning to arrest us. He will kill us. Okay, wait. Stop. Why does he want to kill you? -My mother hired him. -Yes, my grandmother. She also took his eye out. His eye? That was a while ago, though. That has nothing to do with this. I already did my time for that. I am confused. Take us to another city, another jurisdiction, I don't know. To some cops he has no connections with. Or just let us go. Come on, help us, please. Please help us. Just let us go. Come on, help us. It's not too late. I can't. What about my daughter? Come on, please. I'm begging you, please, help us. I can't. He outranks me. He'll just crush me. Masha! Masha! Open the door, okay? Masha! Masha! Masha! Masha! Open the door. Masha! Masha! I can't let you go. Open the door! Why are you standing still? Come on, help us! -Okay, that's enough. -Open the door! Masha! Don't move. Put that back, right now! Give it to me! Start the car! I'll whip your butt when we get home! -Oleg, do something! -Masha, what are you doing? -I know what I'm doing. -Olya, take the gun from her! Hey, what's going on there? You dumb idiot! You could have just let us go! Open the door! Masha, I just got out. Start the car! Turn it off, I said! I said, stop the car! -Masha! -Asshole! -Step on it! -Turn around already. Fuck! Get out! Don't come any closer! I have a gun! -Go into the woods, quick! -Where? I said, go! Fuck! Uncuff me. -Take off the handcuffs. -Yeah. Masha! Masha, are you over there? Are you okay? Masha! Fuck! Masha! Masha is not here! Olya, are you fucking nuts? What are you doing? It was a real love story. FOUR YEARS EARLIER Full of wild passion, hatred, and jealousy. Such love doesn't last long. It burns brightly, incinerating the lovers' hearts. Heartless bitch! It was our kid! Not yours, ours! You should have asked me! You owe me that! I don't owe you crap! Fuck! Go ahead, keep going, you crazy bitch! I'll kill you! I'm moving out to my mom's! You're not going anywhere. Let me go! I'm sorry. You bitch! You bitch! Bitch! How are you, sweetheart? I am so sorry, but you… You should have told me! You think you'll just get to embroider gloves for taking a cop's eye out? You're wrong. We have four long years ahead of us. So no fooling around. I like fat chicks like you. They fall down loudly and some of them never get back up. Are they beating you? Who? She slipped in the showers. Fell on her face. I will talk to someone… so they can watch your back. Yeah. Anyway, I thought it all over. I needed some time to process it all… Most importantly, I am no longer mad at you. What? I forgive you. Are you fucking nuts? I'm behind bars because of you, hello! -Yes, but you poked my eye out. -Because you almost killed me. Because you had an abortion without talking to me first. Hey, I didn't come here to argue. I'm doing everything to get you out. Yeah, I lost my temper. But you lost your temper, too. You will get out of here soon, I promise. I'll be fine with one eye, too… I love you. Fuck off. Olya, please. I love you. I got it all figured out. Marry me. You're fucking crazy. Oleg wasn't lying. He really did love her. But even the strongest love cannot stand up against the Federal Bureau of Corrections. Olya served her whole sentence. What a bitch. Driven by false hope, Oleg came to visit her at the prison camp again. Many times. But every time she refused to even come out to see him. Perhaps his feelings are still alive today? Who knows… Olya, are you fucking nuts? What are you doing? You put an APB out on us! Do you have no sense of decency left? I'll cancel it as soon as we get everything settled. Why don't you tell us instead how much you sold out for? By the way, how much was there, exactly? Because things are not looking too good right now. Just let the officer go, dear. Let me go, please. -Shut up. -Okay. Don't be stupid. They'll put you away again! I came with Oleg. He will fix everything! -I'll fix everything. -There. Just let me have Masha! Mom, did you forget that you cut me? You are insane! Olya, I will help you. Let's figure things out. As a family. To make everything okay. I'd rather do without your help! The last family attempt to figure things out ended in prison for me. Are you still mad at me, really? No way… To be honest, I'm not that mad anymore. But an APB - that's seriously fucked up! -She's getting away! -Olya, stop! Olya, stop! Idiot. They took my gun. We'll get it back. Where's mine? Help me find it. Damn… I told you to get away! Right, so they could finish you off there? Stop! Stop! Stop running! She is my daughter! Fuck off! Masha! Does she have a gun? Do you have a gun? Masha, I won't be mad at you! Those two idiots! Don't call anyone. Please, don't. Don't… Are you going to shoot? You picked up a gun first. What's wrong with you? Pull yourself together. Damn… You will go home right now and pack all Masha's things. As soon as we get to the city, I will call you. And you will never pull any crazy crap anymore. Let Oleg clear everything up. Do you understand? I will bash your head in right now! Do you understand? Mom… If you ever want to see her again, do as I say. Freeze! That incessant bitch. Olya! You'll go down for this! Hey, that's my boat! Stop! This time I will shoot! Your child is over there! That was my boat, too. This one will return. Mom is batshit crazy. If they catch us, how long will they put us away for? This is not a game. She almost shot you. But she didn't, did she? You got shot! You got shot! We have to get to land. It's not moving! It's not moving at all! There's water! There's water! There's a hole, we're sinking! Head for the shore. Hurry. -Just keep rowing. -Hurry! Shit. I can't swim. Are you for real? -Water! -Come on! Hang on. You never saw them, got it? Someone crept up from behind. They hit you on the head, took your gun, crashed your car. That's it. Nobody will believe me. -What the? -Now they'll definitely believe you. And they'll give you a medal, too. Are you really going to kill them? Of course not, come on! Did she say that? Yes. No. It's a family affair. We'll just have a normal conversation. That's one hell of a family. This got completely out of hand. You could have hit the child. Do you hear me? That's it! This game is over! Give me the gun! If you did what you were supposed to, nothing would've happened. What the hell are you doing? I'm a cop! Work off your pay! And don't you dare stand in my way again! You've all lost your fucking minds! Like I said, a family dispute. Mom, listen… I want to talk to you… Yeah? Hurry up with the carrots… If Tanya calls you… Can you stop already? Anyway, I socked her last night. You did what? After you and I talked, I couldn't stop thinking about that abortion. So I decided to talk to her about it. I told you to forget about it. Fuck, it's not like I can control it. It just keeps brewing in there. So anyway, we had a fight. Not the stomach, I hope. No. The eye. Don't you ever do that again. You think if you can use your fists here, you can beat your wife, too? It just kind of happened… -On its own? -Stop nagging. That's not what I came for. I want to make up with her. I ordered some flowers. If she calls you, can you just calm her down? Tell her not to be mad at me, you know, woman to woman. If you ever touch her again, I promise to personally kill you. Like I said, I didn't want to do it. Isn't that clear? I'm going. I gave you life, I can take it away, got it? Got it. Come on, people, speed it up! Somebody! Help me! Help me, please! Help… Everything will be okay, just hold on. Come on, come on… You know there's no chance we'll run into them now? So what do you suggest? To go back home, take a shower, eat something. I sent out the APB. As soon as they appear, someone will tell us. In the worst case, we'll find out where the husband lives. They told us once already… Or do you want to get into it with her husband, too? Maybe I don't want to get into it with anyone. I am not going back home without Masha. Why don't you just let her go? I'm sure you could have figured it all out. She'd visit you. After all, Olya is your daughter… If I could drive, you'd be dead already. You think I… will just let this go? Am I supposed to doubt that? Olya… No matter how much time I spent with her, teaching her things, she still barely graduated from high school, couldn't hold down any job. She ended up behind bars. Tell me, why is she so stupid? I put so much effort into her. She's not really that… The prison thing - that was actually my fault. That doesn't matter. And you want me to trust her with my child. What can she give Masha? Masha… is different. She is smart. She is brave. You can't even imagine how clever she is. She can really become someone. Someone good… But not with Olya. So you're willing to kill your own daughter for that? If I have to. Take the girl's mother away from her? If I have to… Masha! You saved my life. No biggie. It was fun. That's it, the clothes are dry. Yeah, and I accidentally read the letters. I think it's all bullshit. I don't believe a word he says. You have to come up with plan B. What will happen when we get to the city? Nothing will change. Grandma won't leave us alone. I will kill her. What? I will kill her myself. Don't be crazy. Why not? We have a gun. She won't just back down, like you said. The evil hag sucked enough of our blood. We'll ambush her. Whack quietly in the woods. Nobody will ever notice. What about the one-eyed dude? What about him? Either he'll help us, or we'll whack him, too! One witness less. That'll teach him not to hunt down little girls! That wound fried your brains. No. Yes. -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. Yes-yes-yes. No. What is this? Vasilyeva is acting out again. We sent her to punishment cell. Sign this. What? Your resignation letter. Are you okay, Mom? Let's step out. -What did I do? -You didn't do anything. And that's the problem. I don't get it. You're about to have a baby. That's a responsibility. I mean… Not only financial responsibility. It's a whole new life. And it's up to you what that life will be. So what? So nothing. Try using your brain. I propose that you break free from this damned prison. Sure. So this life will be in poverty, at the very least. You can move, find another job. Your dad and I will help you at first. Mom, you're getting too worked up about this, you need to chill. I'm just fine. You want changes, go paint the kitchen or something. Just leave me alone. I just don't want to see you… repeat… my shitty life. It's an okay life. I like it. Do you know them? Unfortunately, yes. It's better for you not to get out. Masha… let's go home. No. Masha, let's go. Mom, do you realize you actually shot me? Well, you're still alive. Oh, yeah… Why don't you just let us go? I can't. Why not? For your own good. You won't understand me now, that's normal. But when you grow up, you'll thank me. I will fuck you up. There, you see. Well… Finally, we're all here together. Girls, let's solve this problem constructively. Shut up. You are a traitor. I'm not a traitor, I wanted to help. What an interesting notion of help you have. And going to live with a stranger, some pen pal? That's idiotic, Olya. Stop this fucking shit already! He's not just a pen pal. I've seen him with my own eyes, and he is normal. Normal guys don't write letters. Especially not to cons. And especially not to cons with kids. You could stay with me. We'd be parents to Masha together. And your mom'd be nearby. I'm serious. What the… Oleg, come on. Olya, go live with whomever you want. Just give me Masha. Masha is staying with me. Mom, please. No. I can't let you destroy her life. Destroy it? I'm saving her from you, so you don't destroy it. -Me? -Yes, you. Just look at me. She'll be better off anywhere but with you. You liar! I… I do everything for her. I did everything for you. What everything, Mom? You ungrateful bitch! You screwed up your own life, you hear me? That's enough, Vera Pavlovna. Give me the gun. You spineless piece of shit. I am so tired of you! Masha, go! Asshole, bitch, shit! Oleg! Are you alive? Yes. Cunt! Fucking bitch! Mom! Mom?! Yes? Fuck! Asshole! Idiot! Piss! I'm alive, too. "But I believe that… supporting and inspiring each other… we can start a new life. We can enjoy living again." This is the last time I'm ever dragging you anywhere. Fuck! -Come on, take him! -Come on! Come here. Hurry up! Come on hurry up! I'm doing the best I can. You're like an old piece of junk. You can thank your grandmother for that. Hurry up. Well, go on.
