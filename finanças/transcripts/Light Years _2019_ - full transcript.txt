I don't know, you were just screaming about something in your cups. Well, it was for a good cause. Do mushrooms make you horny? I'm so horny. Are you guys horny? Why do you have to say horny like that, and so many times? - Horny and mushrooms don't rhyme. - I would have sex with anybody on any substance, but you do not have to say horny like that. - You guys are gay. - Us, gay? - No. - Everybody's a little gay. Biologically speaking. You just got to shove it down. I'm definitely zero gay. Which thus, makes you gayer than Christmas. Whatever, there's, like, so many chicks in there, and you guys are in the corner like jerking each other off. Did... we jerk each other off? I mean, I don't... think so, but I'm not really in charge at the moment. Am I interrupting something? No, this is, uh, this is stupid, we were just... - I am going to... - Get a beer? Yup. Sorry. For what? I wasn't... for the hugging, I was not hugging you on... purpose. We hugged. We certainly did. How you doing?

What are we talking about? - Kevin, you don't have to try and be cool. - I'm not cool. - Whatever. - I'm on mushrooms. I mean, it's all pretty weird. I guess it's not that weird. I'd like to have kids at some point, but now that seems irresponsible. What were we talking about? Am I having this trip? What'd you guys eat? - Mushrooms. - And you just left him out there? It was scary. My hands were tied. I don't know why I even asked, or... cared. Oh, right. Is it because you're here with... Well, fuck, so many weird things in the world, but what I think you're asking is not weird, it's just funny. Why? Because he's a fucking loser. What? You broke up with me. You think you're better than everybody. You guys must be getting eaten up. Kev, could I? Why'd she have to say that so hurt? Because you broke up with her for the... because she had bigger breasts. That's... so fucked up. And such a weird, and scary way to behave. Being a dude is so hard. Oh, that one wins the night. Do you think I think I'm better than everybody? Big time. I don't think that, especially... You don't think what? - That I think I'm better than everybody. Shh! - Oh, absolutely. I don't. Like he's ordering poutine.

Why do you have to say condo like that? - I don't appreciate... - You're living in the goddamn house. Well, whatever they're doing, whatever they've been doing... Why are you talking like that? - But I know they're not just... - Like it's goddamn Fast Times over here. Because last time I checked, pot and manual labor...

I don't know, dumb-asses left one behind in Kevin's room. How did they get? They're 16. What do you just have mushrooms lying around the condo? Would you shut up, please? I don't know, when I dropped them off, it... something was... So I came back, and poked around Kevin's room, and found it, I mean, I don't even know, I haven't seen these things - in 20 years. - Oh, please. Uh, I'm upset too. It's... I'm upset. I'm going to strangle them. One hundred and ten percent, but before we strangle, let's just maybe take a breath. - Take a breath? - Yeah. They're safe. Are they really chopping? It's just... they are safe, let's let them ride this out, and we'll drop the gauntlet tomorrow. Oh, of course, you want to be the cool dad. No, they're just tripping, and I don't see - anything... - You want to be buddies with them. Do you remember the last time you ate mushrooms? - No! - I do. - And what does that have to do with... - My mom was watching Em for the first time, and we went up to the North East... Yeah, so, what do you propose, Lar? I don't know, now I feel like I'm tripping. Okay. Well, should I make them some food? - Do they get hungry? - I don't know, you know, maybe give them some fruit, and put on Europe '72, - you have all my records, so. - Don't. - Axe! - Yeah, I was going to say. - Say what? - The axe thing. - Well, why didn't you? - I was scared. Shit, they're gone. I got to piss. So sick! Man, Hartford '96? - Good ear. - God, that was my first show. The first time they ever encored with Monkey - and the Merry Go Round. - You're kidding me. But it was Monkey on a Merry Go Round into Spaghetti Spaghetti. Shoot me in the dick. Eyes of the world, put those away, kid. I'm kidding. What are you going to do? I don't know. Get a Gatorade. Really? Yeah. Well, what flavor? I'd stay away from the Frosts, you know, the blends. Uh, how about just red? - What are you going to do? - Green bottles. It's going to be all right. Really? No, but, you know, it's too late to stop now. - What the hell are you knocking for? - What? The cops knock. - The cops called? - No, I'm just saying. - Well, I couldn't find them. - They'll be here. What makes you so sure? They could be driving to Timbuktu, or, you know, God forbid, playing with an axe. Timbuktu? Listen, I think the axe portion of the evening is over, for whatever reason, I think hallucinogens may bring Briggs closer to normal. They'll come home. - Is this loud enough? - What? Do you want a beer? I don't think I have any wine. - Great. - What? Sure, I'll have whatever. Let's see. All this goddamn champagne. I have this champagne, actually. For what? I don't know, it's just here. Were you expecting company? Do you want some champagne, Liz? Sure, might as well toast our kid to the psych ward. - What? - Sure! Probably the greatest song of all time. Such a weird night. What a weird life. Hey, Briggs, when's the last time you even hooked up with a girl? Guess that's a sore subject. - Briggs! - He's fine. Fuck me. Man. Jesus fuck. What the... every fucking time. Whoa. I haven't had a glass of water in, like... two weeks. That was not chill. I'm chill. Lar, the bathroom is disgusting. Excuse me? - It is. - Oh, go jump. The bathroom's... If you're going to have our daughter living... - Did I leave the toilet seat up? - It is. Sorry. But I cleaned it yesterday, and I don't have to explain myself... Have her living here... you guys have your own thing to figure out, okay? I mean, maybe for just once, you could be on my team. You kind of broke up the team, Liz. Don't make it simple. What a great year. That's nice. This part's weird. This part of the mushroom? No, this part of being a parent. Yeah. It's not like you can just march him back to the hardware store, and make him return it, and apologize. What he... what did he steal again? It was a magnet that was shaped like a cartoon corn. Right. That's why he's so afraid of cartoon corn. In the heart of the belly of the lion's den, and you just bounced. And I would do it again. - You'd be terrible in war. - Yeah, I'd like to think I'd be the worst. There should be a medal for that. Pussy heart. Sir, I mean, it's right there on his uniform, four pussy hearts, and his two... what do you, what do you call a soldier's time at war? - Tour. - Tour. - Sir. - Sir. Look at me. Guys. Give me some. So shy, it's a good deed, in a weird world. You forget to taste things sometimes... or something. What? You guys fucking making fun of me again? No. Kev? Did we screw up? I mean... on paper? I don't know. Having three 16-year-olds on hallucinogens in the basement of a divorced condo with unsanitary bathrooms. I never said unsanitary. Disgusting is much prettier. Did we? Elizabeth. I... I'm, you know, so... confused, and... sad, about us, about... I, I don't know how anything works. Did we screw up? Yeah, probably. But... we made two of my top ten favorite people in the world. I love her. Dude, you're, like, in love with her. Yeah, that's what I just said, and I will scream it from the rooftops. Dude, that's your sister. The heart wants what the heart wants. I don't know. My mom's here though. - What? - Don't be sketch. I'm not, it's just I know it, because this is how it goes. What do, what do... are we going to be in trouble? What, wait, how is she here? This is Larry's house, why is she here? I don't know, Sebba. - What can you do though? - Fucking bounce. Are we, are we fucked? No, we're not... - we're not fucked. - But what are we going to do?
