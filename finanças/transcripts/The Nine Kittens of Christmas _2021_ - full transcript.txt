Ambrose! Ambrose! Ambrose! Ambrose, where are you? There you are, Ambrose! Hey buddy. Okay. So, the first rule of setting up the North Pole... Is make sure Ambrose isn't underfoot. Oh, what's gotten into you, Ambrose? He's probably just anxious because Zachary's leaving on his ski trip tomorrow. The cat's got a point. What is it, three Christmases in a row off skiing with the boys? It's becoming an annual tradition. Kind of like Christmas. That's my dad's way of saying his misses having you at our house. He must. Otherwise he wouldn't be laying on the guilt like this. Ahh, if I was doing that I'd probably mention that I need volunteers for tonight. Volunteers besides my daughter. So? You in for tonight? As long as you respect my boundaries. I'm not wearing it, Sam. He is so wearing it. Okay, well... those omega-3s are going to do his arthritis wonders. Have we gone over the holiday pet hazards? The dangers of Christmas leftovers. I don't mean to be a broken record, I just don't want any emergencies while I'm away. Well, you won't get any from us. Have a wonderful trip. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Let's go, Mr. Butters. There you are, Duchess. Come here. -Hey. -Hey. Mm, wow. What did I do to deserve that? I'm just in a good mood. Because I'm driving you to the airport? Or because I got you a surprise gift? Hmm. Oh, look at that. That's to entertain you on your flight over. And maybe she'll even let you play with it, Duchess. Is this because you feel bad you're not coming with us? -Today. -Mm-hmm. Once I finish this year's books I'll be on the next flight out to Oregon. And I'm going to be 100 percent. Focused on my family. Okay, look at the upside, all right? You'll have time for Duchess to meet everyone and you'll have time to catch up before I get there. What, you haven't been home for Christmas in like... Five years. And look at what you've accomplished. You finished residency, opened up a new practice. Co-opened. And who's the chew toy on top? You met me. That's right. Okay, what's wrong? Just promise me you'll be there. I'll be there, all right? With bells on, right, Duchess? Oh, hey. Glad I caught you. Found this in the bottom of my closet. It's for the event tonight. It says one size fits all but they can sometimes run a little small. Good news is that's not big enough to fit a Santa outfit. Yeah, but the bad news is there's only one other thing that it can be. Sam, we talked about this. How did you come up with her name? Duchess? Well, when I adopted her I wanted her to have a name like Queenie but one that was sort of clear that she was her own cat. I miss Queenie. Oh, I know. We all do. Queenie was one of a kind. An alpha-cat who ruled my heart. Duchess is less of a ruler and more of a listener. But still royal. Yeah. What's this? Oh, my hand Santa. Okay. I am seeing some thematic links with your hand turkey. You'll have to excuse our lack of tree. Mom was waiting on you to pick one out. She was? I've been waiting for you to do a couple things... like open this. What is this? I found it when I was cleaning out the lake house. Mom must have left it. Thought we could open it together. Hmm... "To Marilee and Jaclyn. Love Mom. Merry Christmas." This must be 20 years old. I know. I don't know how we missed it. You missed a present? Well, the year our parents passed away we missed a lot of things. Do you want to do the honors, open it for us? Oh, wow. It's an advent calendar. Look at this. She must have made this herself. What do you think's inside? Petrified chocolate. Mummified candy cane? By now. Hey, you want to open December 18th and break the tie? What about all the days before that? We have to wait till next year? She's so smart. She knows what I'm going to say before I say it. Okay, go ahead. A charm! It's a sleigh bell. I'm trying to think of where I remember these from. Oh. Mom used to sew them to Tabby's collar. He did not like that. The squirrels did. Yeah. So, what made Miles delay his trip? Accounting deadline. Always seems to come up when we're trying to go away. But other than that, things are going well? Yeah. We added two new exam rooms, a receptionist. What? Oh, personally. -Yeah. -Okay. It's good. It's great. Miles is the only person I've ever dated who's, you know, more ambitious than me. Oh? Tell me more. Well, I think, we're at kind of a crossroads. A good crossroads. The whole time we've ever dated we've always been under stress. But now that that's easing up you must be getting to see his non-work side. Yeah. When he gets here I'll get to see it for a whole week, you know? Is he good with kids, can he make a mean cocoa. Ooh, cocoa! Well, with Sarah around you'll get the answers to both those questions pretty fast. I thought photos with Santa were at the Town Green. Oh they, they were, but they moved them last year when the firefighters took over. But don't worry, Zachary takes a ski trip this time each year. Yeah, I wasn't... I remember Zachary, with the orange cat. That is a really good memory. You were what, three? I don't know, was I? Come on. Follow mom, come on. So, was Zachary your boyfriend? Well, when I lived here, yeah. And then when I moved to Miami he wasn't anymore. Why? Sierra, auntie might not want to get into it right now. You know, I can stay here with Sierra if you guys want to take off. No, no, no, no, no. Listen, I came here to take Santa photos and that is what I'm going to do, okay? -Oh! -Ohh!! -Marilee! -Zachary, um... What, what are you doing here? I'm visiting family. Sorry. You look great. Thank you. You look festive. Sam's idea. -Let me take that. -Alright. Uh, Zachary, sorry, you remember everyone. Hi everybody. We were just talking about you. Oh! Look, I think Santa's ready for you. Let's go see your friends, okay? Come on, Marilee. You don't want to miss this. Yeah, I'll catch right up. She's cute. We weren't actually talking about you. We were talking about Ambrose. How is he by the way? He's good. Still going strong, yeah. And Queenie? Oh. I'm, I'm so sorry, I... That's okay. I, I didn't mean to... No, it happened four and a half years ago and I'm still... I had her for 18 years and I'm... I'm lucky for that, so. And right after you moved to Miami? Yeah. That couldn't have been easy. No. But things picked up after that. I finished my residency and I got my own clinic. I share it with... I knew it. I knew it. Remember, I told you that you'd be running your own show one day. You did. And what are you doing? -Still here at the fire station. -Mm-hmm. Yeah, I made captain about four years ago. Wow! Yeah. -Congratulations. -Thanks. It's not that much different than being an engineer, but the schedule's better and I'm traveling more. Headed up to Mount Hood tomorrow so. Well, won't Sam miss you at his house? Ah, I needed to start mixing things up at Christmas. Um, just... You have a little... -Oh. -Sorry. Oh, oh... Thank you, thank you. Yeah. Blocking your, your eyes. Don't want to be out of the elf code. Yeah. Dress code, we have a certain dress code, so. Well, um... Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Let's take some Santa photos. Yay, there she is. Marilee? I thought that was you. Sam! Harriet! Oh, my goodness! Gabi, have you graduated from college? Yeah, I graduated last year. Yeah. She's actually Sam's newest rookie. Oh, wow. I am impressed. Wow. Oh, and I am very needed at the Santa photo booth. It was so good to see you guys. Same here. It's been too long. Bye. So, I like B. Sierra likes D and Kyle likes C. Mmkay. Well, all of those letters that you heard, we'll take one of each. One way to solve it. -So. -Mm-hmm. What is new in Zachary's world? Um, well he got a promotion. Well, that's good. And a elf suit. So, basically things are... Yeah, the same. He seemed good, though. -Good. -Yeah. Anyone free on Saturday to help a good cause? Well, it depends. What's the event? Our annual benefit for Children's Hospital. Except this year we're building a game room. Oh. Worthy cause. She will take any excuse to get dressed up. This is true. Well, we'll have a band, local chefs, kids' activities. Okay. Well, you had me at chefs, so I will go ahead and take four. Don't you mean five? One for Miles. Yeah, right. Miles. Um, I guess he will be here in time, so five it is. I know you want to come, buddy. But staying at the firehouse is a win-win. You get spoiled rotten and I get some R&R. Just after I take care of this. Oh, my gosh. Hello, hello. How many of you are in there? Okay. Oh, you're just in time. We overcommit again? You can never overcommit to charity, Sam. These are for the hospital, these are for the gift-wrapping event, and the rest is for the Redmond Food Bank. You don't mind the drive? Well, it's your day off. I figured I'd whisk you away and get you to myself for a while. Nice to have some, you know, distance. Distance, from what? Don't worry. They know it's my day off. I have two captains covering for me. It's Zachary. He needs me to swing by, apparently. It's... Urgent. All right Sierra. Advent calendar and breakfast, one minute warning. Two-minute warning! I don't think Sierra was expecting a new best friend for Christmas. I don't think Duchess was expecting a personal trainer. Oh, she loves the attention. I have so little left in the tank by the time I get home from work. This is nice for her. I don't know how you have much time left for Miles. How do you two do it? Oh, we sneak in a dinner here and a lunch date there. Mostly we just flirt in the hallways between check-ups. Well, must be working. You two look smitten. Yeah. Calendar... ready. Okay. Number 19. What do we have today? A present. Oh. I can see why Grandma put that in there. She was always the best present giver. Mm-hmm. Birthdays, holidays... And Christmas Eve. Duchess! Oh, breakfast? Sierra... Oh. She loves that cat. Hey. Speaking of the Christmas Eve gift, I haven't quite nailed down what I'm getting Sierra yet. You didn't finish all of your Christmas shopping, did you? Is Christmas shopping ever done? Eh, not really. Okay. Uh-oh. There are only seven kittens here but we started with nine. Did you count the orange one twice? There are two orange ones. Maybe three? Where'd they go? What are we going to do? Um, just breathe. Take it a step at a time. First we gotta figure out how old they are, are they healthy, weaned? That's a good idea. Ambrose's vet is just down the street, maybe... maybe he can fit 'em in. Oh, good catch! Uh, Zachary? Oh. Thank goodness. -Here. -Oh, oh! You're going to need a bigger box. Yeah. Oh! Oh, guys. What are you saying? That you don't want to go to the benefit or that you're not coming here at all? It's not me making this decision, it's... It's the new on-call vet. The record system's crashed twice. Yeah, but it crashes on us all the time. I mean, he'll figure it out. And what if he doesn't? I'm not like you, I can't just turn the work switch off. Even for my family? Look, I knew you'd be upset so I have a solution. President's Day. We fly out to Oregon Friday night, take the long weekend... President's Day is not Christmas. Okay. I'm sensing that this is a deal-breaker so just forget I said anything and I'll fly out tomorrow for the benefit party. No. No, I don't want that. I don't, I don't want a concession. I want you to want to be here, to want to spend time with my family. And I'm tired of... ...I don't know. What are you saying? Miles, I missed my High School Reunion. We had to prep for our grand opening. And the trip, the cruise that we had planned with your family, we had to cancel that. My family knows we're running a business. Yeah. For the last two years, Miles, all we have done is just go, go, go, go, go. It's always one thing after the other. I just, I... I don't know. I... What are we doing? What are you saying? That's it? That's all he had to say? Well, yeah... I figured he would've fought for me a little harder. I don't know him that well, I only know him through video chats. But I do know you and I know when something's wrong. And it may not feel like this now but I think you did the right thing. Yeah, at the wrong time. I don't want to ruin Christmas with my moping. Hey, you spent two years with Miles. You are allowed to mope. And besides it's more than just a breakup. I mean, you share a business. I don't even want to think about that right now. No need. You don't have to solve everything in a day. Uh... Hi. I figured you would've been skiing by now. Ah, well, these guys thought differently. Oh. My goodness, look at this face. Yeah. What is this? Somebody left them at the fire station this morning. I'm taking them over to Doctor Roberts to get them checked out. -What? -Doctor Roberts? I hate to break it to you but he retired last month. He sent that email. Right. I read the email. But I thought that was next year he was retiring. Okay, hi. I'm a vet! You're a vet. Oh, my gosh. Let's get these checked out. Well, I think by their teeth and their paws that they're about 10 weeks old. Healthy like the others? I'm assuming that they need their shots but I can get those overnighted. Well, then I just need like a, like a big pen? You know, with like a, like a roof? I guess I have heard of such things, they're called houses. I just... I'm not sure how they'll do in my house. I just bought it and I'm renovating the kitchen so. Oh. Well, uh, what if we... and, I mean, I don't want to speak for you here, but could keep them here. No. It's a very kind offer but you have a whole family. Who can help. Trust me, this will make Sierra's year. Well, I wouldn't want to be stepping on your Christmas plans. Oh well, when paws are this cute they can step all over our plans. Mm-hmm. All right. Well, it would give me more time to help find them homes. Oh. Well, you don't have to do that by yourself. Oh, no, no. I found them so I should be the one to find them homes. Yeah, but what about your ski trip? I think we all agree that that's indefinitely postponed. So, you don't want my help then? Well, I wouldn't say no if it was offered. Great! Then I guess you're working together. Okay. Well, I will let you two sort this out. Okay. Got nine kittens. Okay, Well, here we go. Oh! Look this way guys! Hi! Zachary. Zach, I can't get the photo if you're blocking the shot. I know, but I gotta place them just right for the adoption flyer. ♪ ...See the lights in the dark. ♪ ♪ I'ma put on my favorite sweater. ♪ ♪ The sun is shining in the snow ♪ ♪ Be the star on the show ♪ ♪ Warm me up in the winter weather ♪ ♪ 'Cause you know it's that time of year ♪ ♪ When we both got to be together ♪ ♪ Underneath the mistletoe ♪ ♪ It's Christmas time ♪ ♪ It's Christmas time... ♪ Shopping for anyone in particular, ma'am? My caroling group Secret Santa. Aww. Here, I thought you might be upgrading my stocking. The one you've had for the past 20 years? Please, Sam. Some traditions are sacred. Yeah? What about the one that I get a kiss every day. Hmm, when did that start? Today. Where is all this confidence coming from? From a man who's about to spend a lot more time with his wife. Fire chiefs can't go part-time, Sam. Maybe it's time I stopped being fire chief. You mean retire? You can't imagine how happy this makes me. So, when will you make it official? I'm giving the speech at the benefit on Saturday. It's as good a time as any. But there's someone I need to talk to first. Hi Sam. Hi Harriet. -Hey. -Hi. Marilee. Don't tell me you wrangled her into Operation Kitten Rescue. Well, uh... I needed a vet. And I'm a vet. Oh. We just did a photoshoot with these guys. You gotta see this. Come on. Who could say no to those faces? You didn't say they were that cute. Well, come on, everyone looks cute sitting in a wicker basket. That's actually not true, but... Wait, wait. You, you want to adopt a kitten? Or you know. Two. It's been a while since we've had a cat in the house. Can you guys give us a few days to kitten proof? Yeah, of course. Now, can I get a kiss? Hi, mom, I'm home. Okay, I think we have it all set. Call her. Okay. Hey Sierra, come here for a sec. What? We just want to show you something. Surprise! So, you only get to keep them for a few days? Mm-hmm. Until we find them a forever home. Why can't it be here? They're happy with Duchess. Well, because they're going to need an owner to buy them food and keep them warm and take them to the vet. And the best Christmas present we can give little white paws here is a forever home. His name's Dasher. Oh, you've already named them. Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen. And that one's Rudolph. Nine, well that's perfect. And on that note, I think it's time we talk about not getting attached, okay? Sure. As soon as I find some old socks. I'm making stockings for them. Too late. What do you think? "My name's Prancer, "I'm eight inches tall but I tell people I'm nine. "Seeking a human that enjoys "shelving and salmon jerky as much as I do." Uh-huh. "BTW I have six more siblings in case you know anyone." That's cute. Well... We have a winner. Winner? You made one? Yes, and you'll never ever see it. Show it to me. No. -Come on! -No. -Yes. -No. There might be something we can use in there. Just let me see. Or not. Looks like a mugshot. Wow. Like the cat went to the DMV. "Ten-week-old kittens, fully housebroken." We might want to put a question mark on that. "Prefer to be adopted in pairs." Okay. Can you tell I made that up? Well, you know what, there's actually a little bit of science to that. Kittens often latch onto a littermate. They call it the "bonded pair." Oh, so it works. Yeah. Lines down Oak and Pickford. Be right there. Charity present wrapping, bring a couple kittens, up the cute factor. Right. Won't you be busy wrapping presents? Ah. You'd be surprised how much I've changed since we last saw each other. I can now wrap presents and get kittens adopted at the same time. See you later? It's a date. Uh, a meet-up. Join up. Live... I'll see you there. Rendezvous. -See you later. -Okay. Be safe. Hey. I heard about the downed power lines on the radio. I wasn't sure you'd make it. Yeah. We cleared it up pretty quickly. Oh. Does this mean that you've forgiven me for the elf suit? They're for your wife. You know, I may bust your chops but I get why you leave town during the holidays. The most wonderful time of the year? Not really so wonderful when you're riding solo. You're not solo, you're family. You're right. Gotta remind myself how lucky I am. Or you could just remind yourself to show up for the tree trimming. People keep up traditions for a reason, you know. Life can change at any moment. You gotta hang on to the good times. You say that like something's changing. It's time for Harriet and I to start our next chapter. And to do that I need to leave the firehouse. You're retiring? I liked how I said it better. I don't know what I'm thinking. Uh, congratulations. That's a... that's a big step for you two. I just um... I can't imagine going to work without you. Hey. You're not getting rid of me that easily. Like I said, we're family. Yeah. Ah. Look at that fold. Almost perfect. Easy, Captain. I might be a rookie but I am in charge of the assignments on Saturday. Translation, be nice to her or she'll give you valet duty. Funny, that's what I signed you up for. Wait, the benefit Saturday? Who said I was attending? You cancelled your ski trip. You have no excuse not to. Except that I have nine kittens to find homes for. We heard you were down to seven. Zachary, Zach... Yeah. You have to go, okay? Dad's making his big announcement. That soon? Oh. It's going to make it hard to figure out a gift for him. I had an idea but maybe I should run it by the others. -Oh, let me hear it. -Okay. Bring up the website. Local, sustainable and they do rush orders. And I'm going to say no. What? No, you haven't even seen the detail view yet, look. But it's a bench. With a... a plaque on it. You know, we can put it out front and we'll call it "Sam's Bench". It's a wonderful idea. I only see one problem. He's still alive. You only think that because of the photo. I mean, imagine it without the sympathy flowers. I can't. Okay. Back to the drawing board. What do we have here? Bundt cake? Mom's cranberry sour cream bundt cake. Ooh. Maybe you should let me be the judge of that? Mmmhmm. Judge away. Mmhmm. Nailed it. Mmhmm. -You truly honored her memory. -Awww. So, I am still struggling with Sierra's Christmas Eve gift. Well, there is a litter of kittens up for adoption. Ugh. Too obvious? Too ambitious. Not quite ready for pets yet. Okay. So, it's a no on the bench, no on the golf clubs. What about a scooter? Oooh, now you're talking. The man's been driving a fire engine for 40 years. You're really going to downgrade him to a scooter? Well, this might sound ridiculous but he actually has- You know what? Never mind. We don't have enough time. Come on Gabi, out with it. Yeah. There are no bad ideas, except for Caleb's scooter. Okay. But it's kind of something you have to see. I know this truck. Sam bought it at an online auction a few years back. He had big plans to restore it until he realized that restoring things isn't his thing. So, I made it my project. I was going to surprise him with it on his birthday. I got a little derailed and here we are. Huh, looks like you made a solid start. I did get the tank working. Do any work on the engine? Purrs like a kitten. But that's the extent of my knowledge. I've never done body work let alone on an antique. It's not exactly a one-person job. No. But it might be a 12-person job. Hey? I think we can do this. Uh, any chance we can switch? This fence weighs like two pounds. You don't have to play the superhero. No, it's not that. I just don't want Ambrose to see me with these two... ...late. Oh! There he is. Hi Ambrose. My squishy little marshmallow. It's so good to see you. It's been so long, my love. Your purr's gotten so loud. Like sleeping next to a motocross rally. Yeah. It means you're happy. Ambrose? Any chance you want to say hi to these two little... Oh, oh! Oh, Ambrose. You don't have to be scared. For the record, he's not scared. He just doesn't like new things. Let me help you there. Oh yeah, doesn't like new things, huh? I wonder where he got that from. So, once you claim one of these guys we take care of the rest. We do everything right away. Home inspection, spay and neuter contract. And if everything checks out, kitten delivery. -Oh, excuse me for a sec. -Yeah. So, has the eagle landed? I'm sorry, I don't speak old movie. Did you get the fire truck into the truck bay? Oh, yeah. And Becca's wife is going to loan us her paint guns and sanders. Great. Now, all we have to do is cross our fingers that we can get it done in time. ♪...Jingle Bells, jingle bells... ♪ Can I wrap that for you? On second thought, that's all you, Zach. -Oh! Can I help you? -Thank you. Well, if you were going for a family resemblance I think you found your cat. I'll just... I'll leave. Any luck over there? Yeah, yeah. Ninety percent sure I found a family for Vixen and, I think, Mason over there is going to take Prancer. Hope so. He was really talking your ear off. Yeah. Well, you know, helping him out, I am a vet. Oh. I'm sure that's why. Mm-hmm. Well, I can see why you use gift bags at Christmas. Yeah, convenience. Right. What? You think you can outdo me? Oh, I... I think I know I can outdo you. Let's see it. Okay. All right. Here's where you fell off the sleigh. It's the triangle fold. -Triangle fold. -Yeah. -You get one fold like that. -Mm-hmm. Nice and flat. Another fold and tuck it over. Triangle fold. Voila. I mean, I could do that if I wanted to. -Okay. -Yeah. I'll just... -You can... -No, you can. -You have the tape. -Okay. It's fine. I'll let you do the triangle. ...Triangle fold. Thing. So, just... Ooh, peppermint. I must be on your nice list. You got four kittens adopted in a day. You're on everyone's nice list. Well, I didn't do it alone. And how is Zachary? He's fun. He was always fun. Why did you break up with him again? I don't know. It'd been two years and I wanted more, and he felt like things were good just the way that they were so- So, when you'd bring up the future... He would say "why mess with a good thing." So, he struggles with change. It's not too uncommon. I guess, I struggle with waiting for people to change, so. Yeah, but you took the internship in Miami. Good for you. I know. I just thought it would be a wakeup call, instead it was... An ending. And now? And now I'm... A grown woman who knows he didn't step up when he had the chance and... I don't know, no matter what chemistry we have, I've gotta move on. Just remember that just because someone doesn't like change doesn't mean that they're not capable of it. No. This is my breakfast, not yours. Yes, I did sleep in these clothes. But you know how comfy the lounger is. Can you blame me? Enough of the dramatics, Ambrose. You're just smelling the kittens and maybe a little bit of Marilee. We were wrapping presents. Don't get your hopes up, okay? She made her mind up about me a long time ago. So, we're just going to get the kittens adopted, then we'll be done, and you and I will have a nice Christmas. I guess I'll buy coffee. The whole firehouse knows? News travels fast. I guess, I'd better make an announcement soon. I planned on doing it at the benefit but... What's stopping you? Well, I can't really quit unless I name my successor. Yeah. That's a tough one. I mean, you really transformed the whole department. The mentoring program, the holiday outreach. No one can fill your shoes. How can you be so sure if you never try them on? Wait. You want me to be chief? I think the question is, do you want to be? I feel like there's pictures of us in that. I feel like we have pictures of our grandparents in that. Yeah, we have deep roots around here. That's the beauty of Jamestown. Imagine spending five years of your life just struggling to get a foothold only to realize the place you feel most at home is the one that you left. Well, if that's true then Miami wasn't for nothing. It helped you figure out what you didn't want. Now, it's time to figure out what you do want. Well, that's easy. A practice with boundaries. Getting to know my clients' names. Weekends, evenings to myself. Vacations. Preferably somewhere closer to you guys. Hmm. I'm liking this practice. Keep talking. So, the outdoor market's too crowded, the ice rink is too dangerous. Same goes with the snow play area. Well, there aren't too many events that are BYO kittens. Yeah. Unless we make our own event. You're thinking what I'm thinking? I don't know. You thinking cat cafe? -Okay. -Yeah. Well, you think she's going to let us do it here? I don't see why not. You could introduce yourself, play the vet card, see if she's game. Yeah, something tells me it's going to go over better if you ask. Hi. All right. Bets in, you guys. Whoever guesses today's charm gets an extra pecan bun. Hmm. A Santa hat? Ooh. Uh, harp. Angel. Cheater! You only said that 'cause I said harp. Fine, bow. Uh, ribbon. Okay. Let's see. Ah, cheater wins. What is it? A bow with no gift. Yes. What do you think it means? Hmm... I don't know. Wait a minute. You know what these are from? These are from Mom's charm bracelet, the one that she used to wear. Right, to church. When she'd sing on Christmas Eve. Yeah, and then she would take it off when she was making sugar cookies and put it by the sink. And then we would fight over wearing it. Yeah. Oh, it's like getting a little piece of her back. Yeah, it is. Now, I just remembered something. It's 1:00. I have to give Rudolph his vitamin drops. ♪ Ding dong Merrily on high ♪ ♪ In heaven the bells are ringing ♪ ♪ Ding dong verily the sky... ♪ -Hey. -Hey. Uh, wow. So, we're doing the cat cafe tonight. Yeah. Kate, the owner, said she'd take care of refreshments. We just have to bring some cat supplies and cat toys. Great. Yeah, how'd you swing that? Oh, I may have promised her that I would bring a bunch of firemen. Ah, yes, the old fireman trick. Works every time. Hey. This remind you of anything? Being back here in the store. When we first met? You scolded me about giving Ambrose milk and you called me a hero. I think, I even gave you a double hero. That's right. And now you're like a superhero. Because of the... just... there are a lot of cats now. Well, I'm sure you've even been called that before, so you know. First time from you though, which means something. ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Thy leaves are so unchanging ♪ Well, no one said we couldn't draw a crowd. Yeah. Firefighters heard about the food, the ladies heard about the firefighters, one hand washes the other. There is nothing a woman likes more than seeing a man hold a cat, except for when it's a kitten. I tell my cat everything. What I spend on cat food I save on therapy. You look like you could use an eggnog latte. Oh, running out of cat jokes out there. You can always wear one. Okay. Tell me about this. You have a cat sweater but no cat. Running this cafe is my life right now. I hate to think of a cat waiting for me at home all day. Well, what if it was like a... a bookstore cat. Aren't bookstore cats usually sleepy, chill, older? What if I could guarantee you two out of the three? Come and take a look right here. -Hi sweetie. -Hi. -He's pretty chill. -Very chill. And sleepy. -Hi baby. -Hi. Thanks again. Thank you for coming. Well, Prancer and Vixen have been claimed. And Comet is going to the lady who liked my therapy joke. Well, she's a therapist so I doubt that. And this little sleepyhead has shown he's going to make a really good bookstore kitty. Dasher and Dancer are going with Sam. Okay, so that leaves us three. Uh, speaking of Sam. He's retiring and he asked me to be chief. Wow! Zach, that's amazing. But what if I don't want the job? Why wouldn't you want the job? You're perfect for it. You're experienced, you're qualified, you're... Good. I'm good. You know, why sign up for more drama when I'm good. Because what if you could be better than good? Better than good? What if it's worse? Then I'm not good anymore and that's why "good" is good enough. Wow. Been here before. So, I'm just going to let you work that one out, um, while I figure out... Wait. There's only eight. There's only eight. Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen. Rudolph. Rudolph. -Rudolph! -Rudolph! Buddy. Where did you go? Come here, buddy. Come on. -Rudolph! -Rudolph! -Rudolph! -Rudolph! Ru- -Sorry. -It's okay. Rudolph. No. -You go. -You. -You little sneaker. -You scared us. You did scare us. Hi sweetie. I know. Marilee, when I said, good... It's fine. It's fine, no. Well, it's a big day tomorrow so I should... ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ You're it! Tag. Our go-to whenever Mom and Dad were taking too long. Well, we're certainly carrying on that tradition. Okay. You sure you don't like this one? I was kind of feeling it. See this is where you and I are a good team. You go off of instinct where I stick to a very strict set of criteria. Here we go. Because what may seem like the perfect tree doesn't mean that it always passes the test. What test? Have I not told you about the Christmas tree test? No, you have. But at the time she was a little more interested in her sippy cup. Okay. Like this one. First you've got to make sure that it's fresh. Inhale deeply, see if it smells Christmassy. You know, like the spirit of Christmas. Then you gotta make sure that it passes the lean test. You gotta look at it head on, make sure that it's... Symmetrical. Then you lean to the right. Nah, I'm not doing it. Sam. Then you gotta lean to the right. To the left, and then center. And if it checks all the boxes... If it checks all the boxes you've found the one. You know you've found the one. We'll take it. Thanks. Unless someone snatches it out from underneath you. Um, there's a lot more trees here. We'll... we'll find another one. Yeah, but not like that one. Well, think of it as a teachable moment. The next time you find the one, you won't drag your feet. I drag my feet? You know, I saw some Fraser firs up front. Let's go check those out. Yeah, why don't we go hit that holly table? Come on, let's go. Nice to see you guys. -You too. -Great idea. Enjoy your tree. Hope you find the one. Oh, hey. ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree... ♪ Come here. You know I was so sure that this would go faster with four people. Everything we put up, Rudolph bats down. Zachary? Oh, I'm just ignoring it. Let's focus on this. Yeah, but what if it's a home for one of these tinsel bandits? It's true. Oh. The church choir has practice tonight and Zachary is wondering if I could help him pass out flyers when they leave, but that's no... Ah, well we're basically wrapped up here, so there's nothing stopping you. Oh. Uh, well... I should probably help. -Yeah. -Yeah. -I'm just going to go. -Have fun. You picked those up in Miami? What? I thought they would be, you know, good to hand out fliers to. Or get a healthy case of frostbite. Here. Give me your hands. I'm fine, it's good. Give me your hands. See? Oh, you're right. That is warmer. Yeah. Oh, goodness! You startled me. We weren't ambushing you. No, we were just waiting for you to be done. Can I give you one of these flyers? Yeah, depends what it's for. Did you two put on the cat café the other night? Yeah, that was us. Oh, I meant to come to that. You are in luck, because we still have three kittens to be adopted. Oh, really? So, if you know anyone. You know what? You're looking at her. Yeah. I'll make it easy on you. I'll take all three. -All right. -Wow! Yeah, love me some kittens. I'll call you. -Okay. -Oh, uh... Okay, have a good night. Thanks, you too. Wow. That was a... a lot faster than I anticipated. Yeah. I guess we're done. We can go home. Well, you've got your home, and... I got mine. Yeah. Come here. Come here. There you go. Come here Vix. So, this choir lady. She checks out? Well, she founded a cat rescue so it's hard to find a reason to say no. All right you guys, eat. So. if there's no more adoptions, does that mean no more Zachary? Well, yeah, it's pretty much just the home visits and that's a one-person job, so... Okay. I think we could probably take that down. Well, it sounds like you two talked, right? I mean, he sent a text. I'm not sure if that was about business or us, but I said I'd talk to him when I got to Miami. I just want to focus on my family, on you guys. Well, you can't argue with that. I don't think he understands how important this time is to me. Okay, I got you. We're going to hit some snow here, so about four steps in the snow. -Okay. -Slippery, careful. Go slow! Alright. Okay, keep going. I'll bet it's a fire badge framed and mounted. Don't ruin it, Sam. Helmet framed and mounted? Okay, now. Surprise! Wait, wait... That rusty old truck I bought? How'd you do this without me knowing? Ask Gabi. She led the charge. It was a group effort. Whatever you all did, it's a work of art. The best going away gift I could even imagine. I don't know what to say. So don't say anything, just drive. Well, looks like you guys hit the jackpot. Yeah. Cat lady. My kind of person. Well, down to the wire now. Sam and Harriet have finished kitten proofing so after we do the drop off we'll be done. Yeah. Phew. What are you going to do with all your free time? Oh no! I didn't have a chance to call you. The rescue just got a litter of four-week-olds. I have to play mama. Oh, they haven't been weaned? They need someone who's bottle fed before and I'm the only one. Oh. So, you can't take our kittens? I'm afraid not. -Oh, that's... -Oh. So disappointing. I hope I haven't ruined your Christmas. Oh no. -No. -No, no. We'll take care of it. Yeah. -Have a good night. -You too. Well, I guess, we're back to square one. Yeah. So, you want to... Yeah. Well, we've exhausted the firehouse. We've already hit up anyone who ever sent me a kitten meme. We've gone through the bookstore, cafe crowd. And the present wrappers. I don't know how we're going to get the last three adopted short of a giant billboard sign with their cute little faces on it. Can't we put it in the window? That's the cat's window. Their special spot where they'll watch the world go by. You realize we sound like cat people, right? And now it's official. Gabi, they're here. We're going to trim their tree. It's a family tradition. Oh, good. Well, trim away. As soon as I get the adoption papers signed I'll be out of your hair. Uh, you're invited too. Well, that's sweet of Harriet. It was my idea. Hello! Oh, my gosh! Come here. Look at them! Welcome to the family. Oh, you little... Look at this. Um, hey, it's a big tree so we need a plan. Well, um... I can take the top. I'll do the bottom. Okay. And uh... Okay, you and Marilee do the middle. But then what will you do, Sam? Oh. Well, someone has to babysit. ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a Happy New Year ♪ ♪ Glad tidings we bring to you and your kin ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a Happy New Year ♪ -Ah. -Ah. Another thing I'll miss at the firehouse. Your Christmas brew. I'll drop some off each November, keep my legacy alive at the Christmas party. Or, maybe I can just keep the legacy alive. I'm going to take the job. I want to be chief. It's not about her. It's about me and you in a lot of ways. You helped me become someone who can do this job. Who wants to do this job. Can we tell the others? Soon. There's some stuff I gotta take care of first. Anything I can help with? Yeah actually. Thanks. Five, four, three, two, one. Yeah! Merry Christmas! Oh, where are the kitties? Oh, um, over here. Merry Christmas. It will be, once we find homes for these last three kittens. Do you think that maybe we should have like a brainstorming session tomorrow morning? Tonight would be better. Maybe in a few hours? Yeah, th... the cafe's probably open. Uh, let's meet up at the firehouse. Firehouse it is. Firehouse? What's at the firehouse? Yeah, I don't know. He seemed kinda cagey about it. Hmm? Probably flashed you that cute little smile of his too, didn't he? Are you implying that there's more to this pet adoption than pet adoption? No. Have fun. Okay. Zachary? What is all this? Sam's retirement gift. Which doubles as a billboard. You did all of this just now? Yeah. There's a place that does it in an hour. I thought I could park it in front of the benefit tomorrow. You know, the more eyes the merrier. I'm so sorry. I just, I... I... And here I thought you would have nothing to do. Oh. Oh, hi Duchess. I have it together, right Duchess? I mean, I got into vet school. I started my own practice. So, what kind of a person flies halfway across the country and kisses her ex-boyfriend after five years? The one she's been trying to get over. Ugh. Do you approve? Or do you think I should sleep on it. To be clear, she kissed me and then walked away, so. If you know what that is about, I'm all ears. You just want to be scratched between the ears. That's all right. So, I was thinking that I would wear the green one, but then I was like no, I should give you first dibs, so? Thanks Duchess. I'm glad someone could give me some feedback, even if it does come with cat fur. Hmm? Tonight? The Christmas benefit? Oh right. Yeah uh, uh, blue. You're not coming, are you? Ah. Yeah, I don't know. Kinda gave Zach some mixed signals last night so. You're just trying to get kittens adopted. There's no mixed signals there. Actually, I kissed him. Oh! Well... Just like, right on the mouth. Just... That is pretty straightforward. What is wrong with me? I thought I had put Zachary behind me but every time that I'm with him it's just... It's all still there? Yeah. Hey, ease up on yourself, and Zachary. People change. People change their minds. But just do me one favor. Hmm. Don't let this muddy things. If you have any inclination toward moving back here just make sure it's for your own reasons. Ha! Now, it's all making sense to me why you wanted to borrow my rig. Yeah, well, when you have a ride like this people look. Thought I'd park it outside the party tonight, see if we can't get these last three adopted. What did Marilee think? Hard to tell. She uh, kissed me and walked away. The first part sounded good. I think she doesn't want what happened before to happen again. Will it? Well, I'm a different person now. But she doesn't seem to see that for some reason. Let me ask you, this different person you were, did he make a mistake the first time around? Biggest mistake of my life. Did you ever tell her that? Not in those exact words. Or any words. Zachary, I've been married for 30 years. Happily. I wouldn't be either of those things if I never copped to my mistakes. It's so weird seeing you all dressed up. Oh. Ditto. You look great. What's up? Dad's making a speech in three minutes and he hasn't said who's taking his place. I'm freaking out. You can't freak out for three more minutes? Mentors don't come along every day. They also don't just walk away. So, does that mean you'll... I mean, I'll be in your corner no matter what my title is. -Okay, you promise? -I promise. All right. Um, I can hold down the fort if you want. Thank you. I wasn't sure you would be coming. You look beautiful. Thank you. I wasn't sure either but um, and you look... Handsome. Thanks. Shall we? Welcome everyone. I want to thank you for taking time out to support Children's Hospital. We have these fundraisers every year, but this year, this one's special because we have raised enough money to build the game room. Yeah! And because... It's my last. Aww. Yeah. Yeah, some of you knew that I was retiring and then those of you that didn't, well now you do. But hey let's not look at tonight as a goodbye. Instead let's, let's call it a hello to someone that you already know and love. Jamestown's incoming fire chief, Zachary Stone. Come on up, Zach. Come on. Do you think you could recreate this? It's called a caramel brie tartlet. -Mm. -Right? Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're lucky I got you one. They're almost out. Kyle, you can't recreate a recipe after just one taste. I'm going to need at least three more. Go! Okay, all right. Three it is. ♪ ...Jingle Bells, jingle all the way... ♪ Excuse me, Jaclyn? I know you weren't expecting me. I'm Miles. Miles? Welcome to Oregon. So, what made you change your mind? A question. "What if things could be better than good?" I was not expecting that. It was my fault you moved to Miami. No. Zach, you don't have to. I do. You told me what you needed and I froze. I was so afraid of losing what we had that I let you slip away. I've learned from my mistakes and so, I guess, what I'm asking is if you... Hi, uh... You need to come with me. Right now. Is everything okay? Sorry. Sorry. What is it? What? It's Miles. What's he doing here? Best case scenario he's here to talk business. Worst case scenario... It's a grand gesture. Hey. Are you double-fisting Shirley Temples? Nah. One is chocolate milk. How are you going to sleep with all that sugar? I'm in training. For? Staying up late tonight so I can stay up later tomorrow. Oh right. Christmas Eve. Staying up for Santa. Smart. See, you get it. I know you're upset from me cancelling the trip. But we can't just walk away from everything that we've built. It's just... I don't think we have to. I don't understand. I want to help you keep the clinic thriving, Miles. I just... I just won't be working there. Well, what are you talking about? What about us? I can't. Look, I can hire a new vet to take over the nights, the weekends. Come and sit down. Do you think someone will adopt Donner, Blitzen, and Rudolph? Let's just say, uh, there's been some interest. He's here? I thought he wasn't coming. You know that guy? Only from their Christmas card. I know that I've been prioritizing all of the wrong... No, no. Don't apologize for who you are. Your ambition is what drew me to you. I love that about you. I just want to be home... with my friends and my family. I belong here. And you belong in Miami. You do, you love it there. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. -Hey. -Hi. Um, have you seen Zachary? Did you, uh, ever tell Sierra that you and Miles broke up? What? Why? What do you mean? Okay. Oh, boy. Ugh. He's not answering. Well, you could go by his house. He's not going to come to the door. What about a cat door? Really? You're going to joke right now? Me climbing through a cat door. Not funny. What are the chances after all of these years we're back in the exact same spot. Why wouldn't he just ask me about Miles? I think all of these years might be the problem. That's the thing Jaclyn. When I'm with him it feels like no time has passed. But it did. You moved on, right? And whether it worked out or not, Zachary needs to come to terms with that. You want to know how my night went? First, it was magical. Incredible. And then it ended on a really bad note. Seems to be the running theme for me. Sort of a cycle I just can't break. You understand. What? What are you doing? Fine. I'll try him one more time. But if this goes wrong, I'm firing you as my life coach. Ambrose. You're lucky you're not a silly human. I need some of your cat wisdom. Humans are supposed to be the smartest. The best memory, the most foresight. So, why when things don't work out between us do we not just accept it? We convince ourselves that somehow magically it's going to be different the next time. What? Oh, you would have run off too. She had a boyfriend I... I'm assuming. Why didn't she tell me? She doesn't owe me that? Well, I guess I'm the one who didn't say anything to stop her when she went to Miami. You're very wise, Ambrose. Unlike me. A silly human. Oh. No, I can't answer that yet. No, I can't. I'm too embarrassed. Ambrose, no, stop. Ambrose! Did you just bat me? Ambrose! Hello? Zachary, is that you? Zachary? Are you there? If you're listening, just don't hang up. That guy that you saw me with was my boyfriend but I broke up with him. For a lot of reasons, but mostly because, well, he wasn't you. So, whatever went wrong between us, I just, I want you to know that you set a really high bar. Okay? I'm sorry. Bye. Thank you. Now, that brunch is over we have a family tradition to keep up. So, each year on Christmas Eve the moms of the family give a gift to their daughter. But this year we're mixing it up. You're giving the gift. But I didn't buy anything. Well, it's a little different in this case. It's less of a gift and more of a promise to give of yourself. And to give two cats a home. We're adopting them? Mm-hmm. You showed a lot of responsibility this week. That's right. Cleaning up, taking care of them. Giving Rudolph his vitamin drops. And don't worry about Rudolph. I got five calls about him this morning. So, this is real? These two are really mine? With cats it's more like you're theirs. Hi. -Hey Sam. -Hey. There. Oh, thanks. Gingerbread. Not really a flavored coffee guy, but Christmas Eve I'll make an exception. I got your text. What's up? I was going to ask you the same thing. You bolted from the party last night, didn't say goodbye. I had to go home and sort some things out. Marilee was looking for you. Is everything okay? TBD. What's that? Oh! Where did you come from? What is that? Nothing. It's work. Um, work. -Hmm. -Yeah. -Just work. -Work. -On Christmas Eve? -Yeah. What are you up to? Why are you making that face? What? Just open it. The rental application for Doctor Roberts' office. Miles emailed this morning. He offered to buy me out. I still have to fly there and sign the paperwork and say goodbye, but... I just thought that you, you might want to put things on hold after last night. I thought about what you said about making sure I was moving here for my reasons. And you're right. I have three really big reasons in this house. Well, and now two little ones. And now two little ones. I'm so excited. -I love you. -I love you too. Should we finish this advent calendar? Yes. Kyle, Sierra. All hands on deck. We are opening Christmas Eve. Ready for this? Yes. Okay. A wreath! Yeah. -That is 100 percent mom. -Yeah. She used to make wreaths for everyone. Friends, family. They reminded her that love always comes full circle, especially at Christmas time. Yeah. It does. Come here. -Oh! Rudolph! -Rudolph! Come on Rudolph. We can't forget you. Group hug. What on earth was that? What is that? Should we go see? Merry Christmas. I don't know. Is it? I jumped to conclusions last night and I was wrong. I shouldn't have left. Okay. You know, these last few days have reminded me how I feel when I'm around you. Happy. Really happy. Challenged. You set a pretty high bar yourself. So, you were listening. Would you believe me if I told you that Ambrose made me answer the phone? I don't know, would you believe me if I told you Duchess made me call you? Cats. Cats. You want to come with me? Where? Quick home visit. I found someone who wants to take Rudolph. Oh? On Christmas Eve? Yeah. I know the guy. Just so you know, this guy is not the only one that wants Rudolph. Actually, it's not just a guy. It's a couple. Oh. Can I have a little more info? I mean, are they married? Do they have kids? Not yet. Well, have they had a cat before? Have they fostered? Have they... Wait, uh... Is this your new house? Yeah. What's going on? Marilee... I didn't get to finish last night. Letting you go to Miami was the biggest mistake of my life. I have thought about you every day since. I think that's because we're inseparable. You know, kind of like a bonded pair. Well, I mean, there's some... -Science behind it. -Yeah. Would you adopt Rudolph with me? That's full circle. Oh, and uh, one more thing. Marilee White.... Will you marry me? Oh my, Zach. I guess that's a yes. Yes! Yes! ♪ I always love this time of year ♪ ♪ It's even better now you're here ♪ ♪ You say that all the best things come in twos ♪ ♪ It's Christmas with you ♪
