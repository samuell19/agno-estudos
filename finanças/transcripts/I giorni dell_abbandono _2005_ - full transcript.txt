Stop, Otto! - I saw it first! - What is it? THE DAYS OF ABANDONMENT - It's a dead horse! - Look! You're right. It's a drowned horse. BASED ON THE BOOK BY ELENA FERRANTE Poor thing! Mom, there's a drowned horse! Yes, it's just below us. There's a dead horse in the river. Look! - Where? - Over there! - That's just a bunch of trash! - Trash? Mario, in elastic models, does the Von Mises criterion indicate the tension of the structure? It depends upon... The resistance criterion, remember? I explained it to you! This is wrong. I hate formulas! Then you can't study engineering. I use logic. Formulas are more convenient. Someone as intelligent as Carla... Knows about formulas and more. Very funny. There's your mom. I'll go help her. - Where are you with your translation? - I have 20 pages left. - Is it a good book? - Yes. A teenager finds his mom in bed with his best friend, who then finds his seven-year-old sister in a pool of blood. Monday I'm meeting a new publisher. Look at the widow, so overcome with sadness. If I were you, I'd keep an eye on Franco. I wouldn't leave him alone with Gina. You keep an eye on your husband. I noticed her buzzing around him. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Are you tense? - No. How's the tutoring going? - That girl has no desire to study. - You have to be patient... How crazy! Is that any way to cross the street? He made such a stink the other day because Otto was barking. That jackass. If he touches Otto, he'll get it. Right, Dad? Right. Is it interesting? Then I can interrupt. Know what I was thinking? I miss the feeling of having Ilaria and Gianni inside of me. Meaning? Why don't we have another baby? We have such a big house. What do you think? Well... What is it? Are you not feeling well? - I'll make you something warm. - Thanks. I'm leaving the site. Hold on. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Of course I didn't change my mind. Why are you asking? I have to go now. I do too. Bedtime. We have to wake up early tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night, Mommy. You're going out at this hour? We need to talk. Sit down. What is it? I don't know. I don't know where to begin. I'm not happy. I feel unsatisfied. - You work too much. - That's not why. I feel... a lack of meaning that makes me miserable. - I'm thirsty. I need water. - All right. A lack of meaning? I need to be alone for a while... to reflect, think things over. - Alone? - I need to understand. I need to do some work on myself... alone. We've worked through so many problems together. It's different this time. Mario. - Daddy went out? - He went to the doctor. - What for? - A lack of meaning. - Good night. - 'Night. A lack of meaning? Did he say anything else? That he needs to think things over alone. - Did he pack his bags? - No. Then he'll be back. He's just feeling down in the dumps. He said the same thing just before we got married. He wanted to call it all off, then he came to his senses. See? I'm suffering, Lea. This time it's serious. I'm afraid. I don't understand what's wrong. Well, if that's the case, ask for the name. The name of what? His lack of meaning. Ask him what her name is and how old she is. - Two out of five. - No fair, Daddy. It's not true that daddy left. You guys fought. You're not sleeping here tonight either? Come on. Put on your pajamas. Dad's tired. He didn't eat yet. Good night. - What? You're not staying for dinner? - Sorry, I can't. I made your favorite ragout sauce. Look. You're too good. I don't deserve you. Oh, please. You're not eating? Tell me the name. Of your lack of meaning. The name? There's another woman, right? Come on. Do I know her? You can't leave me here suffering like this. Yes. There's another woman. What is it? This is what you do to me? Is it? You put glass in it to punish me! Go to bed. Mario's supposed to take you out. He's your master, but now it's my job. Otto, come here. Seems like he can't stand me. He does this whenever he sees me. He's harmless. - What's his name? - Otto. - What did you say to him? - "Mr. Otto, leave me be." About that leak in your apartment... remind your husband that my ceiling is still wet. Yes, I'll tell him. - Good night. - Good night, ma'am. Good morning. - Good morning. It's a pleasure. - Likewise. If you agree, we can begin collaborating with this book. It's a novel we're quite fond of. Can you finish it by the end of the year? I think so, even if I don't know the author or the story. A drowned woman is discovered, some fishermen find her in their nets. In her neighborhood she was admired by all. She seemed self-assured, young, pretty, with dark hair and intelligent eyes. She lived with her husband and daughter. Her husband, a salesman, traveled often for work. The neighbors noticed her husband was gone... In no time the woman became thin, consumed by pain. Did her husband's absence reduce her to that state? What is it? Is something wrong? You seem preoccupied. It reminds me of a story I heard as a girl that struck me. Then you'll translate it with your heart and soul. She was no longer called by her name. When you can't keep a man, you lose everything, even your name. They all called her Poor Wretch. The neighborhood kids christened her with that name. Kids can be so very cruel. My mother once said: "She's as thin as a salted anchovy." From then on I watched her. I studied her skin to discover if the salt shined on her body. Ilaria, lower the music! Did you hear me? I'm working. You always listen to my music when you work. She's right. I'll get it. - Hi, Mom. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Great. I found a special offer for the Scotland trip. Mario can't leave Turin now. Then come with the kids. You should have a vacation. Pass me Mario. I'll convince him. He's at work. He'll be home late. - I'll call later. - Don't insist. The kids like the mountains. I'll call anyway. You know I'm stubborn. All right, bye. Tell her the truth. She'll find out anyway. Mario, I left you a million messages. Call me back, understand? The kids are asking for you. What am I supposed to say? Please, call me back. Carla, Gina! Maybe they didn't see you. They did see me. I swear. Gina's his lover. You said she hangs around men like a dog in heat. I was joking. - That's not even the point. - Then what is? Either Mario's having a fling, and he'll come back to you... or it's more than a fling. So? Focus on all the things you can do, all the opportunities a woman like you has. Are you joking? I want my husband, not "opportunities." Tonight I'm going to get him. Surely Mario doesn't want to throw away years of marriage. Surely he doesn't. It's just a fling! Do you know where Gina lives? I don't. I know it's around here. Well? Are you going to find your master? They say that I shouldn't ask or know. That love and 10 years together don't matter anymore. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry. "Dear Mario, tell me... where I went wrong." "Mario... tell me where... I was inadequate." Gianni, get up. Go get the broom, now. - What's going on? - A green lizard came in. - Where is it? - I don't know. Close the door. Go in the other room. Mommy, is it gone? Leave it alone. - Let Mommy kill it. - Let it go out. Now it'll come back. Daddy would've killed it. Daddy wouldn't have killed it. Daddy would've crushed it, right, Mommy? Your father left us and went to live with another woman. We'll have to get by on our own. Go back to bed. Not the answering machine again. This is insane. Is this any way to behave? You have to answer me! Let's see if it works. No signs of life. Sorry. I'm going through a rough time. Signora, you forgot this. If Otto doesn't eat, how will he bark at me? By the way, did you remind your husband about the water leak? Signor Damian... I have no husband anymore. Daddy called. He's coming to visit tonight. What can we do to make him stay? We'll tidy up the place and get dressed up. Get dolled up. The "special occasion" earrings. Your hair looks pretty. Are we overdoing it? I wouldn't want dad to think we're fine without him. Take off that ribbon. Why did I have to get it now? Look at it race! That doesn't count! Kick it. I have an ace too. Look at the pretty wig Daddy gave me. Leave Dad alone now. We need to talk. - Give me the cards. - Come on. 'Night. - Are they sleeping? - Not yet. I didn't put glass in your pasta on purpose. A bottle had broken... It was my fault. I reacted unreasonably. The kids told me you went to Sestriere. Was your lover with you? Don't start or I'll leave. - Can't I ask about your trip? - No. Not with that tone. - What tone? - An uncivil one. - Were you civil? - I fell in love. I was in love with you, and you humiliated me. I'm trying to understand, okay? I'm trying to make sense of it but I can't. Here are my reasons and my efforts to try and understand yours. Read them. I'll read them at home. - Whose home? - Stop it, please. - Don't think this is easy for me. - It's harder for me! Not true! I feel like I'm falling. I'm afraid of the hours, the minutes. Being near a person means noticing the changes time brings, the other person's body becomes a clock, a life meter. - I'm being strangled by anguish. - I anguished you? You measured death based on how my ass had changed? - The kids are here. - Well, where am I? - Read them. I don't understand... - You'll never understand this way. - What should I do then? - Distract yourself. - I should distract myself? - Yes. Have you taken a look at me? - You look good. - Damn right. I look great. Ask Damian, the downstairs neighbor, how I'm doing. - The gypsy? - The musician. - You're seeing him? - Like you're seeing your lover. - I don't like that guy. - I'm the one fucking him, not you! - You do it in front of the kids? - What, fuck? No, talk like this. Talk like this? I'm sick to hell of going... You're ruining me, and you expect me to be polite? Fuck you! How should I word what you're doing with her? Do you lick her pussy? Do you fuck her in the ass, do things you couldn't do with me? I see you all the time! Night and day, eyes opened or closed! But to not upset his lordship, his kids, his fucking dog! I'm supposed to be gracious! Fuck you! Piss off, you dick! Get out of here! Wait, sorry. I'm so sorry. Don't wear my mom's earrings again. They don't suit you. Tell me where I can find you in case we need you! Wait for me. Otto, come here. Otto, go home. Mario! Wait! Mario! Wait for me! Tell me who she is! How old is she? Tell me! I won't get married. I don't want to be abandoned. - How'll you have kids? - I'll get them at an orphanage. Who'll give you the money? I'll get a loan from the bank. It's noon. I won't get married. I don't want to be abandoned. Grandma says that today the moon is in trigon with Saturn. The telephone stopped working right after. I've been here for half an hour. Can I speak to an operator? How may I help you? Finally. My videophone is not working. - Did you follow the instructions? - Yes, for 30 minutes. It keeps repeating the same message. I'm calling from a phone booth. It's boiling in here. Why don't you call from home? I just told you that my phone's broken. - Call from another phone. - I don't have another one. - Not even a cell phone? - Yes, but it's broken. You've got bad luck with phones. Would you tell me what to do? Just follow the instructions or send a fax or an e-mail. How can I if my telephone is broken? Our service is automated. There's not one human being I can speak to? Use your telephone. If I want to spit someone in the face, what's the procedure? I'll transfer you to customer complaints. Fucking bureaucrats! - Mommy, don't swear. - Let's go. Is this the piazza with the cannon? I think so. Will you tell us the story about Pietro Micca? I don't know it. You don't know anything about Turin. Daddy does. Daddy knows everything about Turin. Then ask him to tell you. Know what? Leave me alone. Fend for yourselves. I've had enough for today. Gianni? Ilaria? Where are you? We're here! Where are you? Get out! Are you nuts? It's full of germs in there. Don't touch that! He made me do it! What did you do? You could've gotten hurt in there! Are you nuts? You're a mean mom! It's your fault Daddy left! What did you say? You could've gotten hurt in there! Are you nuts? You're a mean mom! It's your fault Daddy left! How odd. I was sure I'd locked it. - What happened? - Maybe thieves broke in. Let's go see. Everything's in place. Let's check the jewelry drawer. Grandma's earrings are gone. - Thieves did break in. - Thieves don't wear earrings. - They steal them to sell them. - Whoever came in had the keys. Only Daddy does. A dad doesn't steal in his own home. No, a dad doesn't steal in his own home. Go get washed up. A dad doesn't steal in his own home. I was obsessed with Poor Wretch, the woman who disturbed me as a child. When her husband left, she began crying every night. From my bed I heard the weeping through the walls, and it made me shake. A neighbor would always ask where her husband was. She said he was away for work and would return soon. That was far from the truth, and her heart bled in pain. I didn't leave home much either. I feared a neighbor might ask where my husband was. Ilaria took care of Gianni and the house. She liked playing mom. When I was a kid I liked playing mom too, to liberate myself from her authority. But she would scold me, calling me a good-for-nothing. If she were to see me now she would have proof of my inadequacy. How are you? - I'm a wreck. - Drink. Come on. Be quiet and drink it. Go find Mario. Tell him he can't leave us this way. I need to talk to him. I doubt he'll want to, after the scene you made. I want my old friend back. Be strong, please. - You know. - What? - You know who Mario's with. - No, I don't. You're obsessed. So what? I want to know who Mario's fucking. Why? Knowing the woman's name doesn't make any difference. For me it does. I beg you, will you call him? Please. I'll only call him if you come out tonight. All cleaned up and changed. Finally. What are you wearing? Sweatpants under your dress? Let's go. She translates novels. Let's go dance. Come on. I don't feel like it. Dance with me? - I hear you're a translator. - Yes. - Do you know Spanish? - No. - Want to know the lyrics? - Yes. "My soul, if they wounded you, why do you run away in fear? My soul, if they nourished you, why do you not smile like a dove? My soul, my sweet soul, let me guide you. I will be the guardian of our meeting places." - Like it? - Very much so. You're really fun. - No, I'm not fun. - Yes, you are. Let me guide you. I'll be the guardian of our meeting places. Enough. I can't do this. I want to go home. Good-bye. No wait, I have something for you. Here. "Alma", the tango we danced tonight. I'd like you to have it. Would you like to meet again? Why? We didn't get to talk much. - Want to go out one night? - Just to talk? About what? What do two people talk about when they go out? Exactly, what'll we talk about? I don't know, this or that. Is it necessary to go out to talk about this or that? Necessary, what a big word. Of course it's not necessary. Exactly, so why go out? So that's how you tutored her! Waiting till she turned 18 to fuck her! Asshole! Don't touch him! Gimme the earrings. Give me them! Stop it! Are you crazy? You broke my nose! You're crazy. Keep 'em! They don't suit you anyway! You finally answered! - Why are you calling so late? - You're never in! No, it's just that this phone never works. One day it works, one day it doesn't. You sound funny. What? I sound funny. - Let me talk to Mario. - Mario? Mario's sleeping. The kids said you're not taking them on vacation. Tell me it isn't so. Yes, we'll take them. Don't worry. Can I ask where? Wherever the fuck we want! - Goodness, what are you saying? - What am I saying? Quit being a pain in the ass about vacations! I'm being straightforward. I'm sick of this shit! Ever since I was a kid you've pestered me about being polite. But I am fucking fed up with it! Where are you? I can't see you. I have something to tell you. Mario doesn't live here anymore. He left. He left me six months ago. Why didn't your fucking horoscopes predict this, damn it? Happy birthday! I found your license near the front door. It's your birthday. It says so here. Thanks. Won't you come in? It's late though. Come in, please. All right... I'll come in. Come sit. I probably shouldn't drink. I already drank enough. You don't know this... but I often watch you from my window. I like when you're with your kids. But you don't like our dog. Not true, why do you say that? My husband... The water leak. I'm sorry he never fixed it. It's part of the decor now. I like the way you decorated this place. It's nice. I don't like mine at all. My husband's company gave it to us. But it's too big. I get lost in it. We assume we know the people we live with, but then we realize we don't know them at all. I'd say I know you better than I know my husband. He left me for a young girl. Who knows how many times he slept with me while thinking of her? I need to know where I went wrong. I can't shoo away the past like an annoying insect... that lands on my hand, right? You didn't do anything wrong. Do you mind if I... Why did you come to Turin? To live in peace. I left my city too, to be with my husband. And now I have nothing left. That's not true. You have two wonderful kids. Two wonderful kids... I have two wonderful kids. You'll never understand. Distract yourself. I'm not a bad woman, am I? - I'm sure you wouldn't like me. - What? Tell me you like me. I've liked you ever since you moved here. What are you waiting for? Take me! What's wrong? It's nothing. You're just nervous. Look at me. You can have me. Tell me you like it. Isn't this what you wanted? What did you tell me? "Distract yourself." That's what I'm doing. You should be happy! Who are you talking to? I love my husband. So all of this has meaning. Otto. Otto, come! - Please. - Have a seat. Hello. Sorry for calling you on New Year's, but I'm leaving tomorrow. I read your translation. "I called out loudly for my son and daughter... but they didn't respond, they were hidden inside of a cannon. I was obsessed with Poor Wretch, the woman who disturbed me as a child. When her husband left, she began crying every night. I heard the weeping through the walls, and it made me shake. A neighbor would always ask where her husband was. She said he was away for work and would return soon. That was far from the truth, and her heart bled in pain." I'll stop here. Nothing to say? I've been a publisher for 16 years, but I've never seen anything like this. The protagonist of this book you were hired to translate doesn't have two kids or an engineer husband, or a mother obsessed with horoscopes. You inserted made-up details into the translation. What were you thinking? How could you make things up? Will you answer me? They're not made up. They are real. If you want to write your story, you should quit being a translator, don't you think? In today's world, who would care about my story? Listen, I suggest... Please excuse me. I'm not myself. I'm irresponsible. Just tear up my contract. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. How can we go to Lea's party if Gianni's like this? I don't know. Go alone. He's too sick. Wash up and get dressed. I have to call the doctor. - Ilaria, the phone doesn't work. - It worked when grandma called. Idiot! I didn't get it repaired yet. What's going on? There's water in the hall! Mommy, I can't breathe. Otto's been poisoned. Daddy was right. The gypsy poisoned him. Don't be silly. He probably ate something bad. I'll go call a doctor. Stay with your brother. Christ! Do I look nice? Oh, God. Oh, God. - Let go, Mommy! - What are you wearing? Your brother's sick, and you're playing around! - Mommy, what are you doing? - Now you're my Ilaria. - You almost drowned me! - I love you. I don't! How'll I go to the party if we can't open the door? Trust me! You can't get by on your own. That's not true. I can get by. Mommy! What happened? Bang on the floor so the musician hears us. - Don't stop. - But he poisoned Otto! Enough! Start banging! Harder! What's wrong? What is it? It's your fault. He's dying. You're right. It's all my fault. Mommy, I can't do it anymore! Help me. Here, tie a knot around it. It's already midnight. I knew it, no party. Some New Year's. Thanks a lot. Stop complaining and help me! Help me. Help! What are you doing? Signor Damian, help! I'm afraid! He's not answering! - I want Daddy! - We have to get by on our own. Don't you dare cry! Please, don't die! Otto, don't die, please. Otto, don't die. I told you so. Your son is next. Get out of here! Get out of here! Quick, Daddy's here! It's Damian. I just got home. - What's going on? - We're locked inside. The lock is stuck. Don't worry. I'll get my tools and be right back. - Mommy, help! - Gianni! It's my fault. Signora, what's wrong? How are you doing? How are you? Everything okay? Can I have a kiss? I'll come see you later. The kids called me, but don't worry. Once you get home, I'll leave. How did I let myself sink this low? After Gianni's illness, a simple flu, everything changed. My problems took the back burner, and I started looking after my kids. I began to realize how important I was for them, and they for me. Signor Damian was suspected in Otto's death. The kids called him The Poisoner, but he proved Otto died from ingesting bug spray. He was a shy, gentle man. He would wait for me on the stairs to say something, but would fall silent. He'd stutter out a hello and go away smiling. Remember when we came here to run? Want to know how I'm doing? I'm like a plant without water. "Women without love die while alive." That's what my mother would say about Poor Wretch. She was right. At times I saw Poor Wretch's body before my eyes. I had to react, rediscover the joy of living. It was the only way to rid myself of that swollen, drowned body. What happened? I dreamt of a woman floating in the sea. She looked at me with a face that scared me. I know that woman. She's not bad. Will you tell me her story? Not now. Then when? Soon. Want to sleep in my bed? - Why, sir? - That hotel was just horrible. Sorry. Would you like to tell the manager? That's all right. Is the flight to Barcelona direct? - Yes. - Great. Excuse me. Honey, come here. Why don't we go to Brazil instead of Barcelona? Come on! Two weeks, huh? Can I help you? How nice to see you. I work here part-time. We never have enough money. - You have a new hairstyle? - Yes. I wanted to call and check up on the kids. From Barcelona? Don't start. Otto's dead. Dead? The kids wanted to tell you but couldn't reach you. - How? - He was poisoned. Who did it? You did. - Me? - We needed a scapegoat. I pulled through... but Otto didn't. What are you trying to say? Nothing important. Intimacy picks the worst moments to rear its head again. My hands performed that gesture like a faithful pet who, despite all the beatings, never forgets its master. I apologized immediately. You should come visit the kids. You can come too. - Who is it? - Damian. Good evening, Mr. Neighbor. Good evening, Mr. Gianni. I thought you might like some. Ask before opening the door. - I'll leave in a second. - Why don't you stay for dinner? - I'd better not. - You should stay, right, Mommy? All right. We'll eat in the kitchen. Let's go! Faster! Even faster! It's 11:00. I'll go. Your hair looks nice like that. Listen, I wanted to say... There's nothing to say. That night, at my place... was important for me. I can't get it out of my mind. Why do you treat me like a stranger? Aren't you? - You're no stranger to me. - Don't touch me. I can't forgive myself for that night. I was with you while thinking about my husband. I did horrible things. Loveless gestures. Each time I see you, I relive them. That's why I don't want to see you anymore. You never really saw me. Your eyes don't see me. You continue to see me through your husband's eyes. In music, metronomes keep the beat together with the offbeat, which isn't visible. And the meaning is in the middle. You're there too, but you don't know it yet. What don't I know? How to regain your vision. Good evening. They don't want to come. I don't want to force them. Maybe next time. Here's the check for next month. Let me know if it's not enough. Okay, I'm off. The truth is I stopped loving you suddenly. I don't even know why. I tried so hard to fight it... but there was nothing I could do. Is falling out of love a crime? Is it a crime? No, it's not. Olga, this is Antonio. That's Damian! You know the cellist? It was true. I didn't know him at all. I had fallen into intimacy with him without realizing who he was. Was that Otto? The future, I thought, will be like this: the passing of death through the muddled noise of life, joy, together with bouts of pain, the heart aging then suddenly growing young again. It finally seemed like nothing could scare me anymore. One day, desperate Poor Wretch decided to end it all, to disappear into the sea. She wanted to drown to death? She arrived barefoot on the shore and began walking into the sea. As she advanced into the water, all dressed, the faces of her children suddenly appeared in her mind. How many kids did she have? - A boy and a girl. - Like us? Yes. When Poor Wretch was far into the sea, what did she do? She realized she couldn't leave her kids alone. So? And so... she stared at the sea on the horizon and said: "Dear sea, you won't have me." So? And so... she swam back. - She went home safe and happy? - Yes. Good thing. I was afraid she drowned to death. No. - Good night. - Good night, Mommy. Good night. Sleep. - Think it's a real story? - What does it matter if it's true? So long as it's beautiful. I thought you'd gone. I left a few things behind. May I come in? Sure. I was at the concert tonight. I've never heard anyone play so beautifully. - You're exaggerating. - You're amazing, really. It was like you were flying, and we flew with you. Maybe just you. Isn't that enough? Do you love my kids? If they were to start walking now, I'd be able to tell if it were Gianni or Ilaria. I love anything that belongs to you. The beat and the offbeat. Thanks for waiting for me. Is there any way to hear some music? Everything's packed. But we can do without. In holding me close, that silent man was trying to communicate that he knew, through a mysterious gift, how to create a feeling that transported me into a world full of tenderness and joy. I pretended to believe him, so we loved each other for a long time, in the days and months that followed, serenely.
