This film was restored by Pathé in 2018 Prix Méliés 1947 Golden Leopard, Locarno Film Festival 1947 SILENCE IS GOLDEN Cinematograph? We went once, remember? - This makes twice. — My eyes hurt. Then shut them. Let's get out of the rain. Step right up, ladies and gents! The cinematograph! The invention of the century. One hour of belly laughs, free of cares and woe. You'll see the magic shop inside. A man chasing his own head. The wedding of Potiron's daughter. Step right up, folks! Idiot. "Oh, madame! "Ever since I set eyes on you in the street, I have loved you." "What's going on, monsieur? Will you get out!" The bride is a bit nervous. You can understand, ladies. "Just a minute, darling, I'll be back." "Oh, monsieur! What do I hear?" "Help, darling! Help!" Step right up, folks! The cinematograph. The invention of the century. One hour of belly laughs, free of cares and woe. Step right up! Step right up! Do as the gentleman says. They won't. It's Mid—Lent. They're watching the floats. And listen here, monsieur Clément, you have to make us some sad pictures. I prefer sad pictures to happy ones. Each to his own taste, of course, but I know my audience. Don't go in. Why not? Isn't the picture any good? Not good enough for you. Go see the floats, that's more like it. But it's raining. Take my arm, dear child. I'll shelter you. It feels funny to be alone in the crowd with a stranger. You have nothing to fear with me. I could be your father. It's lousy, filming in weather like this... I'm talking to you! Holy smoke! Wait, I'll be right back. Let me through, she's my sister. Sister? Don't pull my leg. A girlfriend. - What are you doing here? — Getting some air. Call this work? Don't worry. Why didn't you answer my letter? I forgot your address. I'll write it down. Come and see me, I can help you. FORTUNA STUDIOS Can't you be more careful? - I didn't know. — You didn't know... If you don't know how to work, stay home. Your throw. Is that all you're good at? Play in the street if you're idle. As if we had money to throw out the window. Your play. - Your play. — Look, guys. Look! Our boy Jacques with a girl. - That's a rare sight. — He's learning the ropes! This is the camera. - You know how to turn the handle? - A bit. You gotta know how to do everything here. Like me. Excuse me, didn't you order a goat last week? No, it's a mistake. We asked for a camel. I don't have camels, only goats. You ordered it, you gotta pay the fee. Talk to the accountant. What's your boss like? A swell guy, but you have to handle him right. It's very important, you know. In that case we'll deal with it tomorrow. Don't you have time today? Not a minute to spare. I'm busy! - Boss... — What do you want? It's for the part of the angel you told me about. I think this young lady might fit the bill. Come in. Let's see your legs. Good. Walk. Busy tonight? No. LN' \ \ 'XL! Sorry? Why sorry? - I didn't know... — Didn't know what? I thought you were working. I am working, my friend. If you'd care to wait here, young lady... What is it now? A man in my office. I can't bring him in here, you'll see why. I had to open the window. Well? I think it will work out. See? I told you you have to handle him right. Jacques! Speak to that gentleman. I don't know about any goat. I ordered a camel! And don't leave that animal here. What were you doing in my office? Nothing. I was just passing. Say, you know that girl? A little. She your girl? No, it's not what you think. She's a... She's utterly respectable. I knew her family. We lived in the same street. Stuck on her? - A bit. — "A bit"? Have a good time. Mademoiselle! You can go. You start work here tomorrow. Thank you, monsieur. And tonight? - Tonight you're not free. — Why not? You have a date with your friend Jacques. Stop! It's a waste of film without sun. Couldn't you warn us first? The clouds can't make up their minds today. Turn round. I'll fix your wing. You can't deal with heaven and angels at the same time. Nothing. Heaven, angels... Just a joke. Who's that old man looking at us? - M. Du Perrier. — Is he an actor? No, a backer. He's the owner of the whole set up. - Is he rich? — So they say. Watch out. He's always chasing girls behind the sets. And you? I never look at the girls. I only look at one at a time. Did you hurt yourself? No, monsieur. It's my dress. Allow me to help you. - My wing. - I'll fix it for you. May I come in? Come in. Now you can rest in here as you're so weak. Thank you, Jacques dear, but I'm fine. Fine? You haven't felt like going out all week. "I'm too tired." Going to bed early suits you. You've never looked prettier. Or more elegant. Is that a new dress? A bargain price. And the fur? And the hat? Bargains too? Must have cost you. Not very much. I wanted to surprise you. Hello, my friend. The gentleman wanted to surprise you. Say thank you. But I have the impression the room is too small. One of these is one too many. So if you don't mind... Please don't push me! Will you let go of this chair! Who's the idiot...? It's you! What are you doing here? Monsieur Clement, I've never interfered with the administration, but if you don't dismiss that hoodlum right now... - What hoodlum? — That gentleman! He didn't demolish the set, you did. He pushed me. I was in the corridor. Your hand. Idiot! Boss, I'm sorry. You should be. Falling in love like a schoolboy. At your age! You still don't know women? I thought she wasn't like the others. She wasn't. She was worse. Just my luck. Don't sulk, she's not worth it. No woman is worth it. Always remember this: There are plenty more fish in the sea. And how do you find them? You want to know? Excuse me, madame, is this going to city hall? No, monsieur, it's the other way. That's all right, I'm not going to city hall. I just wanted to hear the sound of your voice. You don't remember me? - No, monsieur. — You needn't worry. I'm not the kind of man who talks to women without knowing them. I know you, but why should you remember me? I'm just a passerby, a man nobody notices. Where did we meet? There are faces one can't forget. Don't deny it, madame. Yours is one of them. Hasn't anyone ever told you? Don't answer. - Indeed, monsieur. — Say nothing. Don't say any of those things other women say. You're nothing like other women. We stand there inconsolable The heart smiles The eyes well up with tears When it's all over We die When our dream dies This song is for fools like you, who believe in love, who moan and jump in the river. You exaggerate. I've seen you, the shy little guy in a corner with a bunch of violets. The result is: you cry, like in the song, over a woman, just one woman. When there are so many others. There's no shortage of girls. Good evening, my lovely. She's the prettiest. Strike out with one, try another. Won't you teach me how to dance, mademoiselle? Make them laugh. It's a game but you have to win. Again! What am I doing? By the short end By the short end of the telescope You can't see a thing But you see it all When you look in the long end - Emile! — What? Emile Clément, don't you know him? Emile, my old chum. How are you? In a bad way. Remember my sister? No. She just died, in her village. We lost contact. Couldn't make her funeral. - You know how the business is. — Célestin! Just a second. And my poor little daughter, you remember her? She's all alone now. My sister raised her to be a schoolma'am. What will become of her? I can't look after her. Célestin, are you coming? Just a minute. See him? Even he succeeded with women. 80 don't lose heart. Who will look after my child now? You know I've had a smash hit here. I'm going on tour. That's life. Nothing but sorrows since my poor wife left us forever. My poor wife. So long, old chum. Wait, where are you going? You're the glum one now. It's nothing. A memory. - A woman? — Yes, a longtime ago. She's dead now. My one regret. My one defeat. Why? Because for once I was in love, I was sincere, I was as dopey as you. She wanted to get married. And you know who she ended up marrying? - Célestin? — Célestin! Let me tell you, my boy, never take a woman seriously. Again! Go on! More bricks! That's it. The goat man! Run. Keep going. Go! That's it. Nice work, children. Didn't my goat play well? And did you see what I did? Pretty good, eh? Hear that goatherd? After two days filming he's a regular ham. Don't discourage the artists. Get changed. I've done it all, even played a bearded man! It's a wrap, boss? It's a wrap. On to the next! But without me. Where's he going? The kid's leaving us to do his military service. Only for 28 days. Going to play soldier now? We'll be well defended. - We'll be thinking of you. — At reveille! See you in a month, old boy. - Have fun. - Fun? I bet I'll miss being with you and the guys. I'm here. Goodbye. Boss, I want to say... Nothing. No, I want to say thank you. For what? For everything. You're swell with me. With everyone too, but I wanted to tell you. You're not getting sentimental? Not with me! Or with the girls. Remember what I told you. I'll keep the cab till the station. That's for the cab, and that... is for the girlfriends. Gare de |'Est Station! But you're broke, boss. Money is for spending, and women are for... I remember the lessons! Lesson 1? Lesson 1: Never marry! Monsieur Clément? That's me. What do you want with him? I'd like to talk to you. At this hour? Who are you? You don't know me. My name is Madeleine Célestin. What do you have to say to me? I came to Paris to see my father, but... he's gone. Gone? I saw him only a few days ago. He's gone on tour. That's what the theatre told me. Then wait for him. I don't know anyone in Paris. What do you expect me to do? Nothing. I'm sorry. Why did you come to see me? I thought you were a friend of... Of your father's? Yes, of course I am. No, not only of my father's... Did she talk about me? Yes. She talked about you, and I thought... It's pointless. Come see me in the morning. If I can be any help... - Goodnight. — Goodnight, monsieur. Monsieur Clément! Did you see the young lady? Yes, thank you. The poor thing waited outside for an hour. She's gone, madame Victor. Go to bed. Goodnight. Madame Victor! What is it? How long does it take to unlock a door? Hold on! Mademoiselle Célestin! Where are you going? What business is it of yours? I'd advise you not to speak like that. Accosting a young lady, shame on you! She said she didn't know where to go. I know where my foot will go if you don't scoot. What's all this about? This will teach me to try and help. Would you mind returning my umbrella? But he didn't do anything wrong. - I told him... — What did you tell him? I have nowhere to sleep. You mustn't say things like that. It's the truth. You don't tell the truth to just anybody. - Do you have any money? - A little. - How much? - I have 2 francs left. 2 francs... Just where will you go with that? Right. What will you do? Stay in the street? Wait for your father in the rain? Don't say it. You went into the bedroom. The young lady in there is a friend of... No, not exactly. I'm a friend of... I was a friend of her mother's. I don't have to explain this. There's no need. She told me everything. What she didn't tell you is that she's leaving now. She's ready to go. With her hat on. She was waiting for you to get up. To go? Go where? The ninny doesn't know a soul. She knows nothing. I'll send her father a wire. Until his answer arrives, she's not to leave here. You're responsible for her. "Order Madeleine..." - It's Madeleine? — Yes, Madeleine. "Order Madeleine return Brives immediately. "Enjoyed..." "Huge success Marseille." "Enjoyed huge success Marseille. "Tour continues. "Next stop Algeria." Signed: "Célestin." Are you Célestin? Yes. Yes, I'm Célestin. You sure do write bad. I won't go back to Brives. You know your father's orders. I know. Speaking in his name, I order you to go. I'll leave here but I'm staying in Paris. What will you do in Paris? I want to be an actress. An actress? Who said you could be an actress? Even if you could, it's not a suitable profession for a young lady who... - Mama was an actress. - That's true. She ended up marrying your father! I didn't mean that, forgive me. What part was she playing in that costume? A comedy. I can't remember the title. - You saw her in that play? — I acted with her. I was an actor at the time. Was it long ago? It was before her marriage. I was raised far from Paris. Mama used to come and see me. I thought she was the loveliest woman in the world. Was I wrong? You weren't wrong. If she was still alive, do you think she'd order me back to the country? I don't know, but she'd give you wise advice. If she ordered me, I'd obey her, but only her. Forget the orders. I'll give you advice, you need it. Leave your bags here, I didn't tell you to go. Listen. You don't know what Paris is like. You don't know the dangers lurking on every street corner. What dangers? Your mother could have told you. It's not for me to explain to you. You're up from the country, totally ignorant about life. No experience of men! - Never believe them. — Who? Men. They see an innocent girl, they pounce: "You're marvelous. There's no one like you." There's nothing to smile about. What was I saying? "There's no one like you." They don't mean a word of it. - All they want is... — What do they want? Stop that music! You know I don't like it. I can't, I haven't played these tables yet. Here. Let's have some peace. Play somewhere further off. Yes, in Paris, when a pretty girl goes out alone, on every street corner, in the metro, in cafés... Why are you smiling? Do you think I'm pretty? No, that's not what I said. You think I'm ugly, don't you? No, that's not the issue. I'm explaining to you... 'Evening, Clément. 'Evening, Léon. I'm not disturbing you? May I sit down? Mademoiselle. Clément, you old dog. Congratulations. She's young. Yes, she is young. She's a young lady. Our friend Célestin's daughter. Célestin? Good old Célestin. So you're on the stage like papa? - No, not yet. — What are you waiting for? I'm looking for girls for my revue. Come and see me tomorrow. - Goodnight. - Leaving already? The young lady has to turn in early. Good old Clément. Congratulations! She has to sleep as she's working tomorrow. I'm working? I'll put your clothes in the hall closet. Anywhere. It doesn't matter, it's only for a few days. Will you be able to sleep here? Of course I'll sleep. If that damn music stops. Don't mind me. Come on over. I'll make you welcome. Can't you shut the window? 'Morning, monsieur Emile. 'Morning. Forever young, monsieur Emile? Congratulations! Keep your comments to yourselves. And come down, we have to talk. Watch out, the boss has a new one. Spring is here, monsieur Emile? I didn't ask you the time. What do you have to say? Me? Nothing. Good. I'll kick you out if you say a word. She's a young girl, I count on your loyalty. - Sure, boss. - Right. - We get the message. — Understood. If you see a fella hanging around her, tell him he'd do better to go elsewhere. - With a well placed kick! — Exactly. Need anything, child? No, monsieur. You must always call on me if you need anything. In her family's absence, I see myself as... Her father. As responsible for this young girl's future, and you must see yourselves as... Her fathers. As responsible for her, like me. Thank you. - We'll see to it. — Understood, boss. We'll be serious. Children, I just met a sweetie in the corridor! You can't imagine. - And you spoke to her? — I even pinched her chin. Tonight, I'll be busy. You pinched her chin... We're in charge of her future. We're her fathers. Nobody is to make a play for her. If you can't read, find another job. "Seriously disappointed by disobedience Madeleine. "Success obliges extend tour." - How much is it a word? — 5 cents. Only 5 cents? Then put "major" success. Can we begin? I'm ready. Let's go! Camera. Animation. Place your bets! Madeleine, you enter. You see your fiancé gambling. You stop dead. Are you gambling the money of our future home? Of our child? Too bad, I'll win. Queen of spades. Shine on me? Lost!? He lost it all. Your pistol. Fire! Stop! Nice work, Madeleine, You're a natural. Is this your first time filming? Yes, monsieur. You have all it takes to succeed. The physical qualities, I mean. If I may offer some advice... What? C'mon, this way. Enter. Run. Enjoy yourself, life is beautiful! Laugh! Look at the bay in the distance! You're happy. What a beautiful day! The sun is shining! Don't wear yourself out. We can't shoot, it's too dark. Damn! Break. My dear Clément, I'm glad this misunderstanding is over. I love that scene. These young ladies are charming. Does the sea air tire you? No, why? I was joking. This beach, these rocks... All that's missing is the sun. Aren't you afraid of sunstroke? No, monsieur. You should be careful. With skin as white as yours, with such delicate skin... So sorry. He didn't realize you wanted to sit down. Bring on the snow. Heavier. Madeleine, you're on. You're alone in the street. You're scared. What's that noise? You're on, ruffian. Madeleine, defend yourself. Ruffian, raise your knife. He's stolen your money. You don't know what to do. It's night. The wind is howling. You're all alone. It's cold. Very cold. That's it. Stop. We can't work in this heat. I hope I didn't hurt you. Not at all, monsieur. "Monsieur"? Not for the ladies! Have you been doing this long? Three weeks already. So it's all new. Tell me, child... Don't worry, boss. He'd finished his scene. Her heart is always open But she never gives it away Too bad for the stubborn ones Who want to make a play Whoever wants to love Ninette Has to suffer someday Ninon's little heart - So young - And so sweet And so fragile Light as a butterfly Ninon's tender little heart So adorable - Fickle heart - Sometimes flirting Rarely docile It's not to blame Sweet little heart Of anon Mademoiselle, I was wrong. Forgive me. But your grace sent my heart racing I know very well That you'll never love me I know it we” Yes, but I know That you're so pretty Your eyes so full of gentleness Have charmed my heart For evermore Goodnight. Madeleine! What's the matter? Why don't you answer? Are you ill? Did you have some bad news? Then talk, say something. Don't keep me in suspense. Nobody loves me. Nobody loves you? Why do you say that? I don't know. No one cares about me. Don't I care about you? Nobody likes me. How do you know? Maybe the people who like you don't say so. I'm not pretty. Not pretty? But you're lovely, darling. Listen, I've known lots of pretty girls, I see them every day, there's not one who isn't... Not pretty! You're crazy. - You're saying that to comfort me. — I'm saying that because... You have to sleep. You're working tomorrow, I don't want you red—eyed. - Goodnight, Madeleine. — Goodnight, monsieur. "Monsieur"! I've always called you "monsieur". That's true, but suddenly it seems odd. What do you want me to call you? I haven't thought about it. We must find me a name. Boss! - Are we working tonight? - Tonight? Sure. No, tonight I can't. I'm busy. Anyway I've worked enough today. I'm off. Monsieur Clément, can I see you for a minute? - Is it important? - Yes. We'll see about it tomorrow. - Waiting for me? — Yes. I can wait longer. At your age you must never wait. Youth doesn't last forever. - What do you think? — About what? What's happened to the boss. Is it any of your business? - No. — Mine neither. I think the same as you. Paris is lovelier every day. You wanted to live here, now you do. Thanks to you. You wanted to be an actress, you're on the way. Thanks to you. What's still missing? - Nothing. - Yes. Someone who loves you? That's not hard to find. You see all those men walking by? If you fancy one, I'll ask him: "Would you like to marry Mademoiselle Madeleine Célestin?" You want the tall one with the pince—nez? Or that imposing swell? Or the little youngster, with the high collar? Why are you teasing me? If you had the choice, would you marry a very rich man? I never thought about it. Very handsome? A man doesn't need to be handsome. Very young? Age doesn't matter. - Give me another Vermouth. — Yes, monsieur. Recognize that tune? Yes. We heard it the first evening we came here. I haven't forgotten it. I didn't see you. I'll move on as you don't like music. Who told you to stop? Keep playing. Goodnight, Madeleine. Goodnight. Still calling me "Monsieur"? No. So will you decide to call me by my name? I'll have to get used to it. It feels funny to call you... Emile. Not a very attractive name. But the only one I have. I'll try. Goodnight, Madeleine. Goodnight... Emile. Boss, I don't see how we'll be ready tomorrow. - We'll be ready. — It's already 5. We'll work all night. I'll stay with you, children. It will be fine. - It suits him. — What? Nothing. Yep, it suits him. How are those fittings going? Nothing's right. I must redo the blouse again. Redo it, redo it. It will be fine. Monsieur Emile? I said a bonus for all the staff. We already owe them 2 weeks wages. We'll owe them a whole month. - Boss, a problem. — No, I don't want problems. The actor playing the explorer is sick. - He can't come tomorrow. - Find someone else. I have, but I wanted you to see him. He's here. - The kid! - Hello, boss. I thought you'd quit. I don't want to be a general any more. I'm working tomorrow? Try on the costume. Hurry up. If it doesn't fit, I'll have to find another one tonight. I advise you to knock before entering. - Who is it? — It's me. Don't come in, there's a man undressing. You can say hello to him... without looking. Hello, monsieur. Hello, mademoiselle or madame? Not madame. Mademoiselle. A charming young lady. The set isn't ready, I must stay late. Shall I wait for you? No. We won't be done before midnight. Have dinner without me. Do you mind? A bit. A bit. What a sweet thing to hear. Thank you. Good bye. Work well. The costume fits me perfectly. How's your love life? - Nothing. — Nothing? Not a chance. I was in hospital for 3 weeks. - And the nurses? — Nuns! And all my lessons? On my first leave, I had a go. It all went beautifully. Until I learned she was getting married the next day. Just my luck. So what? What could I tell her? Tell her? "I'm just in time. "Isn't it a miracle we met tonight? "You were about to marry without joy or love. "Without love, I can tell. "Without the love we only ever find once. "Don't wait. Make the most of your fleeting youth, "in the words of the poet Ronsard: “Gather the roses of life today...' etc. Say anything you like. I didn't think of it. But I'll give it another go. I'm in Paris now. And in uniform. Tomorrow I'll be a civvy. Tomorrow you'll be in costume. At 8 o'clock. See you then, boss. Full up inside. Upstairs only! Excuse me, mademoiselle. Is this the way to Parc Monsouris? I don't think so, monsieur. No matter. I'm not going there. I only wanted to hear your voice. You don't remember me? No, monsieur. Don't worry, I'm not the kind of fellow who talks to a woman he doesn't know. Fare, please. - Where are you going? — Opera. Two for Opera. Monsieur, please! Hush. He might think we don't know each other. But where have you seen me? There are faces one can't forget. Don't deny it. Yours is one of them. - Hasn't anyone ever told you that? — Never. Don't say a word. Don't say any of those things other women say. You're nothing like other women. When I'm alone in the African desert night, I'll remember this magic moment a young stranger gave a poor soldier. - You leave Paris tomorrow? — Tomorrow morning. I may not come back. In the army, you never know. Good luck. I must be going now. Just a moment, the time to answer a question. Why didn't you want to come to this café? You've been here before, haven't you? With someone? There's someone in your life. And you love him. No. I'm fond of him. They always say that. But he loves you? - I think so. — He's better than me. I mean, he's a handsome fellow? No. - He's young? — Oh, no. - Then he's rich? — No. What? Not handsome or young or rich? And he has the nerve... - He wants to marry you? — Maybe. And you'll say yes? Maybe. I'm just in time. Isn't it a miracle we met tonight? You were about to marry without joy or love. Without love, I can tell. Without the love we only ever find once. Don't wait, make the most of your fleeting youth. "Gather the roses of life today." It's Ronsard who said that. A poet. You've heard all that. No one ever said you were pretty? - He told me once. He? The old man? Sorry, I mean your fiancé. We're not engaged. I hope you never will be. Time is up for old men. Our turn now. If you really must marry, marry me. You're leaving tomorrow. Yes, so I am. The army, Africa... I'd forgotten. With you, I forget everything. - What time is it? — You don't forget a thing. I'd forgotten there was a time, a tomorrow, a future or a past. I have to be back. The evening is just starting. Life is just starting for us. What's the matter? Nothing, someone stepped on my dress. If you can't dance, stay home. Don't mind that kid. Look at him. He could be her father. No. It's too late. You want to know the time? Madame! Ask her. The question doesn't concern me. What's the time? Time for me to go to bed. I have nothing left. You see? She says it's late. She says it's her bedtime. That's different. What time is it? One, two, three, four... Nine o'clock. Nothing to sell. You can go to bed. Thank you. You know each one of them means a word. "Think"... "of"... me. They don't mean everything I think. You can say a lot in three words. For instance, I a... "love"... you. For lovers every day is Sunday When spring unfolds in Paris The horse-chestnuts are dressed in their best Birds sing gaily on the grey roofs It seems natural for you to call me Jacques. It does seem natural. I can't call you madame or mademoiselle now. - You are...? — Madeleine. Perfect. I couldn't have found a prettier name if I'd tried. For instance, now we both say "vous". But what if we say "tu" tomorrow. Let's imagine it. Are you "tu" well? Do you "tu" love me? Did you "tu" sleep well? Let's imagine it. We wouldn't believe we'd ever been formal and said "vous" to each other. Don't you "tu" agree? I'm sorry. You "vous" don't think so? In English they don't say "vous" or "tu". They're missing out. It's so nice when you say to someone: “You “mus“ are so pretty.“ And an hour later you can ask: "Do you "tu" love me?" You see? I have the Pantheon and the Eiffel Tower at home, and the streets and lights of Paris. We could have lived for years without meeting in these streets. One day, you were at Etoile, me at the Botanical Gardens. Another day, me at Montrouge and you at Place Clichy. We might have lived 20 years like that. We might have died without meeting. But no. Fate has been kind. We met tonight. You told me we'd already met. Yes, I said that. An excuse to speak to you. I found you very pretty. - Are you mad at me? — No. Here that? It's midnight. No, you miscounted. - I counted each stroke. — I heard none. You said it wasn't late. - Don't go. — Don't hold me back. Promise to come tomorrow. - Tomorrow you leave. — No, I'm staying. You said so. - I lied. — And the army? Africa? I said it to keep you here a moment longer. When did you not lie to me tonight? You know when. - You'll come back? — Stay, I want to go alone. - You'll come back? — Goodbye. Tomorrow night I'll wait here. Madeleine! I'm not lying now. I've never spent such a beautiful evening before. And you? It's the first time. Madeleine! You know what they mean? Not in bed yet? I searched everywhere. It's all I found for my flowers. It's not very pretty. You love flowers, you should have bought a big bunch. I only like little posies like these. Can I put them in my room? Of course. I should have thought of it sooner. Of what? Yes, this one too. Send the vases to my house with these flowers. I'll take these with me. - Hello, kid. - Hello, boss. - Life is beautiful? — Very! Whoopee'.! Here's your veil. They're waiting. Without your love There's no spring for me Singing is joyful. It's wonderful. - Everyone's happy this morning. — Very happy. Boss. - Boss, I'm in love. — Again? I struck lucky. Once in a lifetime. Last night, I... I met a girl. I can't describe her... Then don't. You acted silly again? No. I took your advice. Be bold. Always bolder. - Do I know her? — No. - Where did you meet? — On a streetcar. - How? - I spun her a story. "One night in Paris, I'd joined the army..." - I laid it on thick. — Not bad. - I took her to a café. — Good. A fancy dinner, gypsy music, sweet words. - Very good. — We danced. - Then? — She came to my place. - Bravo! — We gazed at Paris from my window. Cut to the chase. It all went well? No. Nothing happened. What? No, it was late. She had to go. You should have made her stay. I didn't want to. Not our first evening. You don't know her. She's a nice girl. So you love her. You're incorrigible. She's coming back tonight. I'll ask to leave early. Don't waste time admiring the view together. Try to be smarter tonight. - I promise. — Be bold! Always bolder! We're in Turkey now. Or Arabia. The audience will chose. You've come to pay homage to Princess Fatima. The princess! You're there. The princess enters slowly. Slowly. With dignity, indifference. You're not interested in that explorer. No! Not that expression! You look surprised. Don't look surprised. With a slight wave of the hand. You bow. What's wrong? Can't you do as I say? It's simple. Look. You walk in. You stop. Let me rehearse! Wait, something's wrong. No. You stay there. Carry on. You now. Advance. Look up. It's you! Very good! Amazed, in wonder. But don't say: "It's you!" Be silent. She's the Princess of Persia. You admire her. It's like a dream. Yes... I think I'm dreaming. Me too. No! Not you! You're the princess. He's dazzled when he sees you. For you he's just a man. You don't know who he is. Everyone ready! Would you mind doing some work? The followers, the servants. Come in. Ready! After bowing to the princess, you retire. She hesitates. Then she follows you. Follow him, Madeleine! Not so fast! Where are you going? No one must know we met yesterday. Will I see you tonight? 7 o'clock at your place. What does that mean? It means: "Hands off." You mean... the young lady? Nothing doing with her. I've seen you making signs to her twice. - Twice too many. — Is it your business? - It is. — He put us in charge of her. - Who? — The boss. - You're kidding me? — Ask him yourself. You bet I will! Hey! No kidding. - The boss is in love. — No way. It's... shh! She's been living with him for a month. Back off. How stupid, darn it! I bought you some flowers and forgot to give them to you. You said you like little posies. What do you want? Do they need me on the set? Yes. Well... no. I mean in a minute. Right. I'm coming. Forget those flowers. You'll find more at home. I thought of you. Thank you. Are you leaving now? Not right away. Will you wait for me? For how long? I don't know. It depends on the new set. Maybe till 10 or 11. - What do you think, Jacques? — Nothing. Nothing? Well, I mean... you never know. Then I won't wait. - You won't be bored alone? — No, don't worry. Be careful crossing the street. And of men trying to pick me up. I know my lesson. Good evening, child. - Good evening, monsieur. — Oh, "monsieur"! Call him Jacques. Good evening, Jacques. - Good evening, mademoiselle. — Her name is Madeleine. Well? Well? - What do you think? — About what? About Madeleine. Madeleine? No idea. I don't know her. But you've just met her. - I've never seen her before. — I know. That's why I want your opinion. What impression does she make when you see her for the first time? You know me, when I see a pretty girl... You find her pretty? No! Not particularly. You don't find her pretty? Yes, of course. Look. If you met her in the street... - You'd try to pick her up? — No! Why not? Because... She looks like a nice girl. Yes, perhaps. - Innocent? — Yes. "Innocent" is the word. You'd realize, without knowing her, that she's not like other women. Yes. That's true... she's not like other women. Here. Take this to her dressing room, will you? For a boy who knows nothing about women you hit it on the head! She's not like the others. Well, Jacques? Anything wrong? All under control. Do you need me? No, thanks. Those boys don't need anyone. Not even me. The set will be ready in an hour. And your date? - What date? — With yesterday's conquest. You asked to leave early. I forgot. - It doesn't matter. — Don't be a fool! For once you've struck lucky. For once, that's true. Let's forget it. What time are you meeting? We didn't set a time. So she may be at your place now? - My place? - Yes. That's what you said. - I won't go. — You won't go? Then you'll blame me. You'll say: "Just my luck!" You'll bore us all. Get going. No, it's too late. Too late? It's never too late. I'll kick your butt till you get lucky! With my boot if I must. Beat it! He's in a hurry. A lady is waiting for him. - Is there anyone to let her in? — No. - Will she have waited? — I don't think so. What a pessimist! Here's what you deserve. I'll come up too and carry her off. No. I'd rather go alone. Don't worry. I'll leave you all the women. - It's over for me. — Really? All women except one. She's not a woman, she's very young. A young girl. You see? Anything can happen. To anyone. I'm in love, like you. Only in my case, I think it's more serious. Well? What are you waiting for? Go on. Run. Fly. If I was you, at your age, I'd be up there long ago. Not keeping the cab? No. I'll walk. I feel young. Life is beautiful. - Isn't it? — Yes, life is beautiful. Then don't waste a second of it. Off you go! See you tomorrow! Hold on. What will you do if she hasn't waited? Mope about? Curse me? - No, really not. - I know you. Look, if she isn't there, come down, and we'll have a drink. - Drown our sorrows. - But if she is there? Then wave at me from the window, and I'll slip away. Off you go. Good luck. - Madeleine! — You kept me waiting. Don't go. No, please stay. Would you be unhappy if I don't stay? - Yes. And I'll tell you why... — Don't bother. I don't want you to be unhappy. No, no! You don't want to kiss me? I do! I don't! - I know everything. — What do you know? - Someone else loves you too. — I told you. Yes, but I didn't know it was my best friend. Madeleine, we have to part. - Farewell. — As you like, Jacques. Farewell. No, don't go down. You want me to go or to stay? The horse-chestnuts are dressed in their best Birds sing gaily on the grey roofs And the gold shining down from the clouds Lights up the room where I wait for you Don't show yourself! Emile has always been very good to me. To me too. Then we must be honest with him. - What can we do? — I don't know. I do. I'm going to tell him. I asked you to stay here. But shouldn't we be honest? Yes, but there's a time for everything. Don't move. He's gone. So happy and confident. Poor Emile. Don't get too emotional. It's embarrassing. And don't mess up your hair. Look how ugly you are. I never said I was handsome. No, you're not handsome. Give me the comb. - Where will we go tonight? — You're going to Emile's. I'll go later. If you're late, what will you say? - The truth. - That's impossible. We'll have to tell him some day. No, you're not better this way. I am as I am. If you don't like it... I never said I didn't like it. Yesterday, you said you were getting married. I said maybe. You meant to Emile? -Yes —So? So? So you arrived in time. I was about to marry without joy, without love. Without that love we only ever find once. You're the one who said it. Isn't it a miracle we met yesterday? A "miracle"... That's what you said yesterday. You make me laugh. Really? You're trying to be sad. Tell me, do you like me less than yesterday? Absolutely not. - You find me prettier? - Yes. Do you still feel like saying "tu" to me? Say "tu". You don't say "tu" just like that. That's to put you in the mood. Hear that? - "Vous"? You're being formal again? — Did you hear? No, I heard nothing. The clock. It must be 9 o'clock. Yesterday, you didn't hear it strike midnight. Yesterday, I didn't know. So you have no heart. - Say "tu" to me. — "Tu" you have no heart. Am I to blame if I don't love Emile? I don't want him to be unhappy. But his time is up. It's our turn now. You said so yesterday. Don't remind me of what I said. I just lied to you. I spouted a lot of nonsense. The rubbish all men invent to pick up a girl. I know. You already admitted it. So? But I know you weren't lying when we said goodnight and you said to me: "I've never spent such a beautiful evening before." That was a lie too. I've spent hundreds of nights like that. And there'll be many more. Tomorrow maybe, with someone else. Slap me. Go away. Forgive me. Let's forget it. It's late. You have to go home. I don't want to. I'll take you back. I'll send you back with a kick! If I have to. Can't you go faster? I thought I was helping out. - I'll never forgive you. — That's all I ask. Home already? I've been waiting two hours for you. It's almost 9.30. You weren't due back until 10. So when I'm away you go out alone in Paris? Who says I was alone? Don't joke. I could lose my temper. So lose your temper. I don't want to, but you should have let me know. I was worried. Nothing happened to me, don't worry. No one tried to pick me up. A telegram from your father. He arrives tomorrow morning. Thank you. Have you thought about what you'll say to him? What about? About... your future. He may ask you to go back to Brives, or to live with him. What will you say? I'll say... I don't know what I'll say. But no one is telling me what to do! You needn't shout. No one will tell you what to do. I'm not a child, I won't be treated like one. "Where are you going?" "Do this." "Do that." "Be nice to him." "Don't hurt them." Who thinks about not hurting me? What's the matter? What do you want? I want to make the most of my fleeting youth, I don't want to wait, I want to gather the roses of life today. Who taught you that? It's Ronsard. A poet! - I must talk to you. — Not so loud, they can hear you. Get on the table. Yesterday, I said I'd never forgive you. - Yes, and? — I thought it over. I forgive you. - That's it? - Yes. But why are you fond of me? Look at me, I'm nothing special. I'm nobody, I have no money, I'm not even good—looking. I know. Emile is intelligent. He has charm and he loves you. I know that. Yes, but there's one thing you don't realize: I don't love you! - We warned you. — But you took no notice. So we have to inform the boss now. - About what? — You don't know? - Come on, let's go. — No, please wait a bit. - We're not waiting. — No way. We're sick of being watchdogs. It's not our job. I'd rather go myself. I'll talk to him. You want to go? Right. Let's go now. We don't enjoy informing. Monsieur Du Perrier said he's coming today. Fine. - Am I disturbing you? — No. - Are you sick? — No. - Something wrong? — No, nothing. I must talk to you. No need. I've understood. - You're in a bind too? - Yes. - Love? - Yes. Your date last night? - It didn't go as you hoped? — No, not as I hoped. It's disastrous! You're a flop with women! That's not exactly the point. Why do I give you advice? You never take it. I did take it. Big deal. You forgot the essential: never take a woman seriously. - "Plenty more fish in the sea." — Agree. - "If one's no good..." — "Try another." - Agree. — Agree. Since we agree, can I continue? The girl I met on a streetcar, who I had a date with yesterday, is Madeleine. - What Madeleine? — Madeleine! My dear Clément, thank your lucky star! You're a happy man. Heard of the Sultan of Socotora? A huge fortune, the world's finest pearls. The Sultan is on a state visit, he's here in Paris. His Majesty wishes to see how a moving picture is made. Tomorrow, the President of the Republic and His Majesty the Sultan, with all their ministers, will be here. Well? Very interesting. Could we talk about it another day? Another day? Yes, I'm busy today. But they're coming tomorrow. Tomorrow? We'll discuss it later. We haven't a minute to lose! I don't have a minute to lose. And I've just lost one. Excuse me. But... So it was Madeleine who you met on the streetcar? Admit it's funny. I swear I didn't know who she was. And you were a stranger to her. That's funny. You told her a story... she smiled at you... As I said. She accompanied you, without knowing you, to a café, a restaurant... I thought she was just any young person. And for her you were just any young person. - You danced? — You know we did. - And then? — Then... Then to your place? We can't hear a thing. He won't dare tell him. He dared. At your age! What do you mean, at my age? Throwing punches. You can't punch some people. They duck. And all you have in front of you is a window. - If your father isn't there? — I'll wait. - If he goes away again? — I'll go with him. He's my father. I'm all he has now. He's never looked after you. All I ask is not to be looked after! - I'm not throwing you out. — No, I'm leaving. - I'm not reproaching you. - Why should you? I thought you weren't like them. Like other women? Remember what you said about men. They see a girl, they pounce: "You're wonderful, you're the only one." All lies... Goodbye, Emile. Goodbye, Madeleine. I should say I'm sorry... Say nothing. I want to thank you for... No. I'd like to kiss you... It's all your fault. My fault? If, back then... You should have been my father! Your father? Certainly not! I'm not ready to play the father to a girl your age. They're not all like you. Not all lonely enough to fall for the first greenhorn they see! They don't all think I should have been their father! See this wall? See all these girls? Some were much prettier than you. There's still space on this wall, believe me. Don't get upset. Angry men all act the same. You stay out of this! Don't worry. I've seen break up scenes. You must never forget this: "Plenty more fish in the sea!" - Monsieur Joseph! — Monsieur? He said: "We'll talk about it later." I haven't seen him since. - Where is he? - Where indeed? It's all under control, minister. Tell me, will they award me the medal here? In His Majesty's presence. - It's a chain? — The Chain of the Silver Moon. Hear that? Nothing's prepared for His Majesty. I fear you won't be ready for tomorrow. I beg you. I'll give the orders. Gentlemen! You must build a stage, hang drapes. Get to work! Hurry up! We're waiting for the boss. I'll fire you if you don't obey. I pay the bills. I give the orders. He's still not here. Monsieur Joseph! Monsieur Joseph! - You're Monsieur Joseph! — Yes, I am. If the reception doesn't happen, I'll close down and fire you all. - All of us! — You too. And me too! I'll fire you too. - That's impossible. — Why? Because the boss fired me this morning. Will you sleep in the bedroom? No, thanks. I'm fine here, I'm used to it. What time would you like dinner? I'll eat out. I'm going for a walk. Do you want to know what I think? A bachelor's life is fine for the young. You should have married long ago. I don't want to know what you think. You could be the father of grown up children. Of a daughter maybe? Like Madeleine? Would you mind stopping? I've been paid in advance. You've been playing that tune for an hour. I can't change it. A drunk told me to play it all night. What happened to you? Look at me. 'Evening, monsieur. An accident? Don't you remember? Did you ask him to play that tune? Yes. It reminds me of an evening that went well, for once. Not this evening? Just my luck. You had to show up, with all your lessons. "Never take a woman seriously." I sacrificed myself for you! - Calm down. Everyone's looking. — Let them look. I'll tell them all I love her. I'll even tell you. It doesn't matter, I'll jump in the Seine. I'll drown myself. You disgust me. Goodnight. Wait for me! Don't leave me all alone. Let him be. You're a swell guy. I won't take you drinking again. You won't take me back. Stop talking. You threw me out. OK. I was wrong. Work tomorrow if you're sober. Go to sleep. Hear me? It's over. We'll never mention this again. You'll forget Madeleine... and I'll forget her too. Goodnight. I forgot to tell you something. For me you're more than a boss. More than a buddy. For me, you're like... Like a father. I know. Here he is. We were right to wait. He has to sleep. Only a minute. It won't take long. Dear old Emile! My old comrade! No one was in. I've waited an hour. - I had no idea... - Don't apologize, I understand. I couldn't go before saying goodbye and thanking you. - You're off again? — Yes. You just arrived. Work, old chum. The artist's craft. We owe it to the public. I have a new song, you may not know it. Poor little Madeleine. You were so good to her. - You acted toward her exactly like... — I know. Such a responsibility! It kept me awake. A grown girl alone in Paris, with all those men. Seeing her with you reassures me. She's in no danger. I can leave without worrying. You're going without her? I can't take her with me, old man. The road, my work, my family life. You have a family? I will have one. I'm engaged. Are you done? You coming or not? Right away, my love. And you're going to marry... Charming, isn't she? And if you only knew... I can't tell you. With her, I feel like a boy. Poor fool. Drive on. If you don't come right now, I'm going. Coming, angel. See? She can't do without me for a minute. Look after Madeleine. I explained. She understands. - Goodbye! — Wait for me, angel! Work it out with Madeleine. Goodbye, old chum. Thanks again. Why did you come back? My father brought me here. He said... You obey your father's orders now? You have nowhere to go? Like the first time I met you. I'd like to talk to you. Those were your words that night. I said: "Who are you?" And I answered: "You don't know me. "My name is Madeleine Célestin." That's right. I didn't know you then. I know you now. That's the difference. But just like before, I can ask you: "What do you have to say to me?" I don't know anymore. If you had left, I might have forgotten you. But what shall I do with you now? Whatever you like. If you still want to... marry me. Me? Marry you? Marry a young girl? Am I as foolish as your father? My father? Don't talk about him. I have no father. I know what you're going to say. Everyone wants me as a father. I'm Monsieur Du Perrier. The owner of the company. I'm embarrassed! I never expected this. Excellency, this is the happiest day of my life. Yes, yes, exactly. Your Majesty is right. It's... Wait. Monsieur. Madame. Dear friend. Do take a seat. You don't like it? Monsieur Du Perrier doesn't like it. I'll have it. That makes two. One for the wife. - Places, everyone. — All done. Don't be nervous. The Sultan only has eyes for you. "Is the young girl for sale?" It's a mistake. Right. What are we waiting for? Everyone ready. We're shooting. Sire, Monsieur President, ladies and gentlemen. We are honored to shoot the final scene for you: Passion of the Orient. Ready? Action! Keep going! You hardly had time to kiss. That's enough! Bring in the Grand Vizier. Stop! We got it? That's it. It's over. His Majesty the Sultan said: "Such a charming young girl shouldn't have to die." I agree. But some believe great art must make people unhappy. Places, everyone! You two, hold hands. Come with me. You enter. You see them holding hands. Your first gesture is one of rage. It's natural. You love that child. Madeleine is frightened, she runs to the window. At this moment, you realize you'll lose her. Forever, perhaps. - Too bad. — Too bad? Do you want her to be unhappy? It's for the dignity of my character. Dignity! You want to make those youngsters unhappy? - They offended me. — What of it? You're no longer a young man. You've had your time. Treasure your memories. They're both young. It's their turn to love and be happy. And if you suffer a little, you won't be the first. We think we're strong, but we all come to this one day. Why do you want to be an exception? I don't want anything. Then why are you arguing? - Ready, Gustave? — Whenever you like. The sun seems to be holding. Let's go for it. The scene opens the same way. But this time, when Madeleine approaches the window... - You like a happy end, mademoiselle? — Oh yes, monsieur. So do I.
