you get this well I was curious as to how you were hired understand oh you little shit I got this job because of my ability yeah Oh cute I was hired because of my track record at Merrill not that I have to explain this to you a relationship with Frank Mallory had nothing to do with it not even a little no what did you do have me followed so it's curious that a woman with a week's history the bank is promoted to head trader over a guy with nine years experience not to mention me with sixth anything no I don't Beryl was running that room as it was a private party for you and Tony Eisner one hundred million dollars I'm surprised you weren't fired right along with him why because I can walk into any trading room in London and get hired like that really I'd be surprised if you get hired shuffling currency some deadbeat offshore bank I get offers twice a month maybe you should think about taking one of them I'd like to go now would you please take me home it's tricky getting off the lake at night you might hit a log or something I'm sure you've done it before okay then let's call a cab I do have cabs out here don't I yeah there's a town about four miles away although I'm not sure

something Anna thanks for coming up this time of the morning I know you're busy we're gonna research calm in 'its hi hello okay then I'll get right to the point I've been reviewing the dollar position since you joined us and I we are pleased pleased and encouraged that the book is running so smoothly thank you our concern is the considerable loss that the dollar operation still reflects yeah its position you inherited of course oh absolutely but one we have to address ourselves to nonetheless you're talking about a hundred million dollar negative position and it's a tough situation we know that that's why we hired you you know you're capable of handling it we're under pressure as well you know are you saying you're not satisfied with my performance Frank absolutely not but Lee and I have been talking about ways of speeding up the recovery process that's right one scenario um I guess that's the right word is a possible incorporation of styles you're aware of course that the bank wants to get rid of this image of recklessness developed under Robbie barrel at the same time we have to acknowledge that Pascoe well he does get results meaning what what Lea is saying honor is that there might be some percentage in utilizing your talents and pastors in some sort of combined operation a sort of team effort what happens when we disagree do we flip the coin it's a notion that we've been discussing Anna and we naturally we wanted to discuss it with you first okay I'd be very grateful if you consider it discussed and declined a plan like that could backfire you'd be looking at a three four hundred million dollar loss I cannot be responsible for that I'm telling you this guy should be put in a straightjacket so you're opposed to this idea yes I am right all right Anna your positions noted but it's an option which we may yet have to consider well if you excuse me sure thanks for coming up my pleasure well I think that's gonna work out just fine [Music] where are you going come on you never get a text I'll give you a ride come on come on [Music] listen I really don't know what you know I thought you flew everywhere I just had this fixed it's very beautiful so you

we've reached a decision about the dollar operation albeit a temporary one he positions this you and Hanna Schumann are to run the book together until such time as we recover from this negative position Ana will continue as principle trader and maintain overall responsibility why not just give it to me give me the dollar book we don't feel secure in doing that we nonetheless recognize your ability to put it bluntly we want the ability without the risk she's not getting results right Donna's getting results we want results faster I don't like it this doesn't leave the room but we'll double your commission over the next 12 months if you resolve the loss you could be looking at 600 grand basically you want me to troubleshoot Anna's position out of the shit right in a word yes well
