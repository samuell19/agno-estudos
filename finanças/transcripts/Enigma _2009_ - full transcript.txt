You will wait until I acknowledge you. General Rothman the analysis team is ready for you, Sir. Good. So Tell me what happened. Three days ago, prison transport four eight zero sierra charlie, known as Genesis, took aboard prisoner 71099 The ship was to travel 36 hours to the Demos Prison Facility orbiting Mars The Genesis never arrived. Zioni class frigates were sent to investigate. They found the ship adrift all hands dead. Was it the Cnidarians? No, sir there has been no activity in that sector from enemy forces. Continue. At some point in the flight Prisoner 71099 escaped custody and murdered the crew. And the prisoner? Dead, She was found in the corridor outside the bridge. We are unclear as to what killed her. Well, then tell me how she got loose. WeÑre unclear as to that as well, Sir. Son, what can you make clear to me? Sir, we are still analyzing the flight recorder. We have processed the visual log. My God! We donÑt have the shooter on screen. But We believe that it was the first officer a, Kyleigh Rothman. My niece. Continue. Ah, yes Well if we zoom in on the right quadrant we can see the arm holding the gun. Now, itÑs definitely not the prisonerÑs arm, and the first officerÑs body was found in about that position. Gentlemen, my niece is dead, and all you can tell me is that youÑre unclear. That just wonÑt do. I want an answer not ÑI donÑt know.Ñ Start over. LetÑs see everything from the beginning. Someone have some coffee sent in here please. Hard dock in three Two One Capture complete. Hard lock Smooth as usual. Thank you, sir LetÑs go greet our guest. So whatÑs the run this time? Cargo or personnel? Personnel. Ah good, no heavy lifting. How many? One. One? Are you kidding? WhatÑs the point? ItÑs a Cnidrian, called Eidolon. The Eidolon? Afraid so. She killed 200 on board the Vendetta. Yeah I know. It took an entire squad to capture her. That's not true. DonÑt you read the news? Look, Fleet's busy fighting in the tragus sector, and since they think that a military convoy would be too obvious, that's where we come in. Look, weÑve done this before. ItÑs nothing new, Captain, weÑre not equipped for this. Yes, we are. Look, It will be just like the time we transported those Lodithian lions. ItÑs not the same. They pay well. How well? How well!? Look, it's a problem solver for both sides. They get the low key transport and weÑre back in the green and this old girl gets the makeover she deserves. Damn it. Wyeth! Oh, Come on. Wyeth! What! Yes, ah Captain, what? The door's jammed again, I thought you said you fixed it. I did. Alright, be up in a second. Come on! CanÑt wait to get off this piece of junk. Prisoner transfer, weÑre at the airlock ready to begin. Roger Genesis airlock cycle initiating Stand by. I never thought IÑd see a Cnidarin in person. Consider yourself lucky. You might be one of the few to see one and live. Where is the captain? YouÑre looking at him. Captain Rhys? The same. Captain Rhys, By order of United Fleet High Command IÑm officially transferring Prisoner 71099 to your custody for final transport to Demos Prison Facility. I will accept the transfer and fullfil the transfer orders. Sir, do you understand who this is? Yes, prisoner 71099 but I donÑt think sheÑs going anywhere. This prisoner is very important to the fleet. I think you should show a little more concern. IÑm not fleet IÑm not paid to care, just transport. Captain! Look kid, I am not a kid! OK, maÑam IÑve done this before. ItÑs a simple hand off. My men will stay onboard. ThatÑs neither required or necessary. If you want to be paid then it is necessary. Fine then please have your grunts transfer her to my brig. Yes, sir and itÑs lieutenant. DoorÑs are fixed. Thank you But youÑre going to need a new solenoid. Also the power unit almost gone, It looks like itÑs a faulty omonic relay. Then again this entire ship could just be falling apart. WeÑre going to put into port after this We all need some R and R. Look, I got a whole shopping list of things we need. Wyeth, you can get whatever you need, but I need you to keep this ship running now. Look why donÑt you just junk her. Huh? Get a new Zioni or Nova. Show some respect. This ship has fed and clothed your sorry ass. All she needs is some tender loving care. Still a lady. SheÑs a strung out hooker with three teeth. Wyeth, Do your job. Kyleigh, Kyleigh! Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Phobos. Come. ComeÑon. Phobos. Move! Keep that thing out of my chair. Ah come on, Captain. He just likes you. I donÑt know what you like about that rat. HeÑs supposed to bring good luck. IÑm not fixing that. Did you fix the internal sensors? IÑm going down there right now. You were supposed to have that fixed this morning. and then you asked me to fix the door. Look, I canÑt be in two places at the same time. Fix the door, fix the sensors, you're going to miss me when I gone. E.T.A. to Demos? Twenty five hours, thirteen minutes. Phobos you nearly gave me a coronary Come here you little rat Ahh! Just make Wyeth fix it. Nah, IÑll get it. What, before or after you electrocute yourself? Look Captain, WyethÑs got a point Why not get a new Nova? You know how much a new ship costs? Yeah I know, with this run we could get one. I love her but sheÑs getting old. Why sink more money into her? Hey, sheÑs a classic I mean think about it. A new nav/com, Jump engines, twice the cargo, and that new ship smell. Look, IÑm not getting a new ship you want to fly the fancy birds fly for fleet. YouÑve got an in there. Yeah, And be a pushy little lieutenant. I donÑt think so. I like the variety here. I wanted to travel. I mean I remember the first time I got off planet. I Just looked out at the stars and knew thatÑs where I wanted to be. All IÑm saying is that we could do it in a nicer ship. What could be nicer? This ship has everything that you could want. I just donÑt get it Look, IÑd no sooner give up of you or Wyeth. ItÑs a ship. ItÑs my life, itÑs my home. IÑve been on this ship for so long that I know every inch of her. I grew up here. I was only 15 years old when I was sitting where you are now. Too young for the job but my old man was captain. This shipÑs been making runs for the better part of 40 years. ItÑs been through two wars, and been to more planets then I can count. I didnÑt know that. Every major moment in my life has happened on this ship. I got into my first fist fight in the corridor just outside the mess hall. Had my first kiss in airlock 2, My father... My Father died in cargo 3. Stupid accident IÑm sorry. Too Many memories. I canÑt just junk that. No sooner then you could work a desk job. Well At least when we restore this classic can we get a new nav computer? Excuse me. Hey! Explosive decompression deck 3 Seal it! Were we attacked? No, IÑve got nothing on sensors. Then what hit us? Nothing, it was internal. Damn it! Deck 3, section 2 is decompressed. Main power is out. Back-up's on line. WeÑve got system failures all over the ship. Wyeth! Emergency bulkhead are closing. Full Stop. Send a mayday to fleet. DonÑt tell them the problem. Just ask for assistance. Communications are out. Actually, the entire array is gone. The Brig! Does it still have power? I can't... I canÑt tell Lock down the ship! Oh God, no. LetÑs make for the escape pods in section 28. No good, weÑve decompressed. OK, then what about engineering? ThatÑs fine but we locked down the ship. The pods wonÑt launch. We have to make for the bridge. No way! There are pods on the bridge. We can disable the ship and escape. Forget the ship! LetÑs jerry rig a pod and get out of here. No. IÑm not letting her take this ship. Fine, You do that and IÑm getting the hell out of here. Damn it, Kyleigh! No! This wonÑt stop here. If she takes this ship she will kill again. SheÑs a Cnidarian. Deep in enemy territory. SheÑll make straight for earth. She wonÑt make it. And what if she does? She killed 200 trained soldiers on the Vendetta What will she do to civilians? I just.. Kyleigh I canÑt let her take this ship, and I canÑt do it alone. We have to stop her here. IÑm not going to die on this ship. LetÑs get to the bridge and get out. Fine. Grab those maglocks. Kyleigh! Kyleigh, stop! What? What is it? A piece of Wythe overalls. SheÑs been through here. Yeah. But, sheÑs not that careless. We gotta go. Kyleigh? Here. Crack a light. I've lost it. I got it. Captain! Yeah. SheÑs playing with us. IÑm done playing, Keep your head down. LetÑs go! Damn it, no power. Cover me while I re-route. My God. Kyleigh? You OK? My God! IÑm sorry, Sir. ThatÑs all we have. The city reminds me of the stars. Not as seen from theground, but from space. Excuse me sir? Space son Have you ever been there? Yes sir, IÑve been to Omicron Station. When Kyleigh was young, maybe ten, I took her to that very same station and she saw those stars. I donÑt think she ever really came back. After that her mind was always in space. She would lay outside at night counting every star in the sky. She said she was going to visit every last one. I think she almost did. I know she saw more of them, than I ever will. Sir, what about the report? Lieutenant, itÑs clear to me that prisoner 71099 killed the crew That doesnÑt match any of our information... Lieutenant! I want her remembered as that little girl with stars in her eyes not as a killer. The stars are beautiful, Sir. Good night, Sir. We never agreed on this. It needed to be proven. But not yet. It wasnÑt ready. It worked didnÑt it The entire operation was a success. No one in the investigation discovered Phobos. He did his job just like you said he would. These people were innocent. Your own niece for GodÑs sake. IÑm sorry you disapprove but there are bigger issues at stake here. Sacrifices must be made. It is unfortunate that it was her ship but to have a Cnidarin in a contained enviroment it was the perfect testing ground. This is my project. No! This is my project and you can be replaced. This weapon will turn the tide of the war. YouÑll thank me when you have a medal hanging around your neck. Tell that to Kyleigh.
