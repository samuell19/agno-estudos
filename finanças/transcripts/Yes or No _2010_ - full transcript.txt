Where is it? Yes, Mom... Yes, I met with the dorm supervisor. I got a new room. It's in the same dorm. Well... Jane has a lot of problems. She does, but she's a good friend, Mom. Me? Hiding something from you? How could I, with a smart mom like you. I wanted to let you know that... I'm just glad I could change rooms, okay? No, please don't leave me... I can handle it. Piece of cake. You don't have to worry. I love you, Mom. Kiss, kiss, kiss. A thousand kisses. I love you too, dear. A thousand kisses back. Okay. Nice to meet you - Pie Wo, I'm a thief stealing your underwear Oh, I'm a thief stealing your heart Cockroach! Get off...! Stay away from me! It's you who should back off! Hold on. I think you cracked a rib. You're a girl? Of course, I'm a girl. You're not even going to apologize? What for? I was frightened when someone looking like you suddenly jumped at me. Didn't you see that humongous cockroach? And this is my room. Your room? Oh crap, I escaped from a lipstick lesbian just to end up with a tomboy. No, no, no! I'm not a tomboy. A tomboy tells me that she's not a tomboy? Really, I'm not. I'm a girl. A girl? What type of girl? Of course, you're so girly... with your face, your hairstyle, your manners, and your body. So girly. Tell me, which part of you resembles a girl? Which part? I can't take this anymore. I want to change my room. Why? You just changed your room. My new roommate is a total tomboy. It's not like I dislike her or anything. It's just difficult doing things around her. I can't help but think that she's a guy. I'm not comfortable living with a tomboy. How uncomfortable? It's just difficult. I can't help the way I feel. You will get used to it. Tomboy or not, if you're not interested, then it's no big deal. Don't I have a right to change my room? Yes, you do... but you've used it already. So I won't approve it again. Here. Since I was here before you... I'm gonna use my rights to establish some rules. This side is mine and that side is yours. This is the border. Do not cross it. I need silence because my fish gets startled easily. My work is very complicated. You won't understand. Oh, it's better to keep quiet, if you can. Then...can I sing? Only if you're a good singer, but not so loud. If you call that singing, it's better that you stay quiet. Can I cook? Actually, it's against the rules. If the maids find out, you'll have to move out. Go right ahead. How can I use the bathroom with this border separating us? Climb on top of it. Fine. Nice to meet you - Pie Fine! NICE The landlady is out. Here they come. Are you okay? My heart...my heart is melting. - Morons! -Oh, we have a choir here. - What's wrong? -My heart hurts. Why? She's more handsome than me. - You're so handsome. -Do you go by mister or miss? - What the heck was she? -Hey sis, where're you going? Blow your nose with it, I don't mind. Who did you meet this time? I don't know but... I think she's the one. Even Nerd was moved by it. That's impossible. She won't move an inch to save herself from a collapsing building. I don't know, I feel like... she understands me in a way that nobody can. There's no way anyone on earth can understand you. What about the one you were crying over for? Don't mention it again. You'll ruin my day. You were on a rampage as if the world was coming to an end. Nerd, have you ever seen Jane fall in love? Sorry, but I can't concentrate. But there's no sound. You had too much action like... It gets so noisy! And the lights keep flashing. How about we move the TV to my side? Pie, got any snacks? I'm hungry. Pie, come here. Who's that? Your roommate? - Don't tell me... -Yes! She's the one I told you about. What do you think? Isn't she handsome? Why not? I think we should swap rooms. Okay? Take Nerd. Nerd is quiet. Was she sleepwalking? That was eerie. - By the way, what's her name? -I don't know. Why didn't you ask her? Hurry up, ask her. You... about yesterday... thank you. It's a small world. Did you blow your nose with it? Silly, who would actually do that! But I washed it already. I'll give it back later. - My name's Jane. -My name's Kim. Then my name's Pie... and I'm not a matchmaking service. What are you planting? Are you majoring in agriculture? Yeah, I'm from a farmer's family. For me? It's pretty. What is it? It's love at first sight. You love me? No, it's the plant's name. Can you still find your way back to your room? It's delicious. Sorry. I was trying to hold it... but this is the best I could do. I don't mind trivial matters like this. I'm not crazy. Are you hungry? Today, I cooked my special dish. You can cook inside the rice cooker? What is it? It's rice mixed with chicken. There's plenty of ingredients. Mushrooms, vegetables...all your basic food groups. Try it. It's delicious. How about it? Good, right? It's so-so. You like to cook? It's fun, whether it turns out good or not. What are those plants outside? Just different herbs and sweet basil. They're handy for cooking. I can pick them whenever I want. So, do you like cooking or planting? I like both. How about you, Pie? Do you like fish? Yeah. What kind of fish is that? - Actually? -What? Its name is Jing-jing (Actually). It's a little dolphin. Really? That's cute. - Is it a dolphin? -No, it's not. They just look like dolphins. So we call them little dolphins. It's actually an elephant-snout fish. It's imported. There's only one inside, doesn't it feel lonely? It's very aggressive. It can't live with another fish. If a fish enters in its territory, it's dead. Like its owner? Hey! It's just being selective with its cohabitants. Is there any tomboy fish? I don't know... but there are breeds that like to be with the same gender. Is there any fish that doesn't like a tomboy fish? You just slipped two past me. I'm just kidding. Kidding. Don't frown like a mackerel. She can do all of that herself, Van. Yes, inside a rice cooker. It turned out good in a weird way. By the way, don't tell Mom about this. She's a total tomboy. I often confuse her for a guy. I don't know how long I can stand this. She will give Mom goosebumps. You can blow your nose with it. Do you miss me? How's the plant I gave you? It's kinda complicated but I can handle it. Let me know if you have questions. I'll tell you when it needs fertilizing. Wanna DEN? Yeah. Sorry. The music is nice. It's not about the music. It's a game. Is this the right place? It must be. The security guard told us so. Isn't university a wonderful place? Oh my goodness! I can't believe it. I just saw an angel. Excuse me, miss. - Is this the girls' dorm building? -That's right. - Is this your truck? -Yes. You can't park here. You have to park on the other side. Let Puey take you there. It's okay. I can find it myself. Thank you. Jeab, help me out here. We have the same hairstyle. - We must be soulmates. -No, we're not. Where are you going? You don't have to fight. I can do you both. Double team! I like-- Oad! - Hello, Miss Kim. -Hi. I only want a few of them. Where should we put them? You can't go inside the dorm, so right here is fine. Here you go. Are you going anywhere else? We still have several deliveries. Do you need anything? It's okay, I'll go to Aunt Inn's myself. Let's go, Jeab. - Goodbye. -Goodbye. What was that all about, Boyd? Do you know this place? Inn's Cafe. It's behind the campus. You know how to get there? Pie, can you take me there? I have to go with Boyd. It's not hard to find. From this building, turn left and head to the pool. Go straight and turn right twice. You'll see a junction. Turn left into that alley, and it's five minutes from there. But the cafe opens in the evening. From this building, turn left... Turn right twice... Turn left at the junction... Turn into the alley, and from the alley... About five minutes and you're there. Turn into the alley... And from the alley, about five minutes... and it's dark. So, you couldn't find the cafe? I'm lost. Where is Boyd? He went with the girl gang. Why didn't you ask someone for help? No, I don't want someone else to take me. Can you take me there? All right. Think of it as a thank you for your chicken rice. That's too much. Aren't you coming? Now or never. One... Two... Three. You can get up by yourself. Oh, cool. I've stayed until the fountain's turned off. Wanna stay until the whole campus shuts down? Is Auntie Inn here? - Kim. -Auntie Inn. You little rascal. Let's take a look. So handsome. How are you? You look prettier. Really? Maybe just a little bit. Dad sent a new wine for you to sample. Wine? I'm thirsty now. - Hello. -Hello. You have good taste. Your girlfriend? She's lovely. No, Auntie. She's just a friend. I'm kidding, don't be so serious. Good. Kim, come and sing a new song with me. Seems like every time I see you My heart gets weaker and weaker I just wanna talk to you, and say hello But I'm always too shy I can't utter a single word when you... You... Hey, Kim, is your aunt a lesbian? Tell me, I really wanna know. I don't know. Come on. I really don't know, and I don't care. I wouldn't know because I'm not gay. Seriously, Kim, let's be frank here. No one would think that you're straight. The more you deny it, the more likely that you are. Okay, then please tell me what a tomboy is like. A girl that looks like you, acts like you... not an ounce of femininity, and she dates girls. Some act like they're real men, all masculine and manly. I see, like the dorm supervisor? Yup. So, I... don't look like a girl... and I don't like girls... and I'm not very manly. So what am I then? Have you ever had a girlfriend or boyfriend? - Have you ever had a crush on anyone? -No, I haven't. Both guys and girls? Neither have I. If I like being with a certain person... want to play with this person... enjoy spending time with this person, and this person is a girl... does that make me a tomboy? Will it change the meaning of who I am, Pie? I still like to play video games, like to cook, and everything else is the same. Will anyone see the true me? Other than just labeling me as a tomboy. What a mess. Damn it. I'm gonna raise some hell. Pie. Damn it! Crap, and I was the one who chose this side of the room. You can sleep on my bed. I'll sleep on the floor. No, it's alright. You can cross my line. I don't take it seriously. Are you sure? Sure, I'm a farmer's daughter. Sleeping on a hard floor is all right. The lights went out! No blackouts! Please come back on! I know! Why are you afraid of ghosts? People are frightened of ghosts. Aren't you? What are you afraid of? Tomboys? Silly, I'm not afraid. I just don't like them. I understand. I don't like darkness or silence, so I have to make lots of noise... because I get scared. Here. You don't like it when I play, right? So you won't be scared. I'm not that good. Stop with the modesty. Play it when you're given the opportunity. I'm gonna smack you silly. Sadist. Queer. Have you ever noticed that... there's someone always watching you from afar? You have been my heart and soul for a long time If only I had a chance to be by your side I would tell you what's in my heart Look into my eyes and you will see what's deep down inside Do you see the reflection in my eyes? Do you see yourself inside? Do you know how I feel about you? I've kept you in my heart for a long time and there is no one else I wish that you would take a look at me Just once more... If only you would glance over and let me know how you feel about me I'm not hoping that we will be together one day I only wish that you would understand Darling... I wish you would know my true feelings I wish you would become my inspiration I want to keep this love burning inside for you and only you, forever... You're scarier than the ghost. I like water. Actually, I like jellyfish the most. I like the way they swim so freely in the water. They're so soft and floating gently. I can't describe it. I'd like to have one for a pet, but it'd be too difficult. You're too much! Isn't it fun though? - My eyes! -What's wrong, friend? Love got into my eyes. - I'm annoyed. -Why? - We lost our territory to a tomboy. -How could you? Let's sing a song for them. Hey, that's enough. You should protect our planet by not going against nature like that. If I saved the planet to get men like you... I'm better off being a lesbian. It's more fun. A lesbian parade. Let's go, darling. Waste of time. Wait, let me ask you this. Don't you get goosebumps when you kiss? Those two won't get goosebumps. But with me, you definitely will. Why did you stop? Hey, that's Van? Van! - Hello. -Hello. Pie, your mom asked me to pick you up for dinner. This is Kim, my roommate. This is Van. - Hello. -I'm Pie's boyfriend. Is this the Kim who can cook inside a rice cooker? You're good. Shall we get going? Let's go, Pie. Allow me. Come on. Boyd, what do you think? Not bad, a very typical couple. But he's not my type, too boring. Yeah, me too. Yeah, so bland. It needs a huge amount of spices and chili. Does Pie really like him? Pie doesn't like anything abnormal. What's so normal about that? Normal is something like you and me. Do you think Pie thinks of us as normal people? JANE Hello, Auntie Inn. Warm milk, please. I got it. Thank you. Is it good? No good? Why the long face, kiddo? No, I'm just bored. Bored? You came here alone. Did you have a fight with Pie? No, she's out with her family. Some guy picked her up. So my cake isn't delicious because of that. Stop teasing me. You like her? Who? What? You got it wrong. Can I ask you something? Looking at the way you are now, how do you really feel inside? Inside? You mean, about me being a lesbian? There are people who look like you, but they are not. Vice versa, they don't look like a tomboy, but they are. It comes from the inside... and not just your appearance. Don't let your appearance dictate who you are. You should be who you are inside. I saw the way you giggle around Pie. How do you feel about her? - We're just friends. -Are you sure? Look carefully... inside your heart and figure out your true feelings. So you don't regret later. Can I take you to the movies next time? Van, could you stop saying that? Saying what? That I'm your girlfriend in front of your friends. You are my girlfriend. Have I ever told you that I was your girlfriend? Pie, I'm sorry. I won't say that again. I'll wait for you to say it yourself. Come on. It's no big deal, okay? Don't frown like a mackerel. Kim? Are you asleep? Why are you sleeping so early? Why didn't you turn on the lamp? I'm not feeling well. I have a migraine. Light makes it worse. Did you take any medicine? YES. Only taking medicine is not enough, you know? You have to massage it. Let me do it for you. Not feeling better? Then we have to start at the head. Our air conditioner is broken. - What? Come again? -I can't stand that heat. - So? -Can I sleep here? Which bed? Actually, it doesn't matter. Your bed is fine, but I prefer Kim's. She's not well. She has a migraine. Really? How are you feeling? A throbbing headache? Let me give you a massage. Jane, her head is exploding. Let her get some sleep. You can sleep with me. Inn's Cafe Yes or No Crazy Hey, where are we going today? Wanna eat grilled pork on a hot plate? I'm hungry now that I see your face. So bold and blunt, but I like it. But it has a bad smell after. Let's go to Inn's Cafe instead? Yeah? Let's go? No, I'm lazy. Come on, I'll treat you to cake. No, I only eat cake when I'm in a bad mood. Today, I'm in a very good mood. And this one beats around the bush. Boyd... I also want to go to Inn's Cafe. We could listen to her music. So, do you want to go, Pie? No, I'm lazy. Got it? Not much left? Let's place it here. Okay, that's enough. Seeing each other through our eyes Sensing each other through our hearts But it seems like our love is backtracking Till I can't reach it You're so close to me Just a breath away But why does it feel like... we're at opposite ends of the skyline? Why does it have to be this dream where... Hello, Van. Hi... I'm bored. Tell me something funny. Loving you... So funny, his fart smelled really bad. Is impossible Impossible I'm going outside for a moment. I'll be right back. Will you be gone for long? A few minutes. I'll wait here. And everyone was like... - It's very shameful-- - Hold on, I have another call. Hello? - Where are you? - The fountain garden. What are you doing? On the phone with Van. He was telling me about the beautiful sunset. Really? I thought it's kinda cloudy today. Where's your girlfriend? Why are you calling someone else? Who do you mean? I mean Jane. Which answer do you want to hear first? That Jane is not my girlfriend... or that Pie is not just someone else? If I'm not just someone else... then what am I? You're so close to me Just a breath away Just a word... Love is just a word Like it's embedded in my heart I don't know when I can tell you I just want to tell you once that I love you so much But telling you about my love is impossible Impossible Pie, are you Van's girlfriend? No, I'm not. We're close childhood friends. - Sure? -Yeah. My mom told me, if we like someone... we should feel all nervous inside... like having hundreds of butterflies... in our stomach. And sometimes, they fly here. Like... there's no weight? Maybe, I don't know. But with Van, there's not one caterpillar present. Have you ever felt like that? Weightless... With girls or... with boys? Since my mom passed away... my dad became a big playboy. So many girls around. He told me that Mom was his only love. After she's gone, he can't love anymore. And he also told me that... love is something that cannot be explained. When we love someone, our heart will know. Pie... if one day I happen to like a girl... will you still be my friend? Pie. Kim. Pie...Kim. Hey, I'm tired. Why do we have to do this on a holiday? Are you alright, teenager? I'm too old for this. Are we done yet? What kind of project is this? So tiring. Come on. Let's take a rest. I feel like having something sweet. - You're not gonna share? -It's not something people share. It depends on the person. So? Come on, share some. There are so many butterflies. Maybe they just escaped? From where? When I opened my mouth. I've had butterflies in my stomach... for a long time, Pie. Where are you going, girls? - Van? -Surprise. What brings you here? My mom asked you to come get me? I wanted to take you to the movies. But why didn't you call first? If you're busy, it's okay. If you have something to do, we can go some other time. Where are you two going? I can drive you. Jatujak market. The two of you, where were you last night? And where are you going again? Why didn't you invite me? So bad. Can I come? You should ask Pie, because even I couldn't go with them. Why, Pie? You only want to go with Kim? No, it's okay. If you want, we can all go together. - Good. Van, let's go with them? -Okay. Let's go. Jane... Hey, Pie, look. I want this, will you buy it for me? - Van, let's go there. -Okay. This one is nice. I forgot a shopping bag. Where? I'll get it. I can't remember which street. I'll go with you. No, no, you don't. I'll take her. It's on that street. Come on, Pie. I'll show you. We'll be right back. If Pie's mom saw these four girls... she would faint. I don't know if Pie has told you... that her mom doesn't like something like this. What kind of thing, Van? Like... girls that look like boys. This is the elder's way of thinking. Is being a tomboy so disgusting, Van? I don't mean to blame you. Pie said that if I were a lesbian, I'd be very popular. I'll be surrounded by girls. I can tell you that Pie isn't going to be one of them. And I know that Pie isn't going to go against nature like that. Pie, she's not there. Let's go. Kim, where did you go? Kim, what's wrong? You think you can do whatever you want, and you can go anywhere you like. I've called you a hundred times, why didn't you pick up? Are you PMS-ing? That's good, right? You could be with your boyfriend. How many times do I have to tell you? Van is not my boyfriend. Take a look at yourself. How about you and Jane? You two are always glued together. Don't act like this. I don't like it. I know that you don't like whatever I am. And that you don't like me. Good that you know. You should stop trying so hard because I'm not interested. It's annoying. I like water. Actually, I like jellyfish the most. I'd like to have one for a pet, but it'd be too difficult. What are you doing? I'm not begging for your interest. I'm not asking for anything. I did it because I wanted to. I know that you don't like what I did. I get it. No matter how hard I try, I will never be the right one for you. - You're that ticklish? -No, I'm not. - Look -Can we delete it? Good morning, Van. Okay. What time? Will you come to me first, or my mom? Okay. See you. My mom told him to take me to run some errands, can I go? Are you alright, teenager? You should go. Okay, be a good girl. Don't let Jane come in and rape you. I get jealous easily. I can tell Jane about us right away. Silly. I don't know what will happen after this. If someone comes and asks me... about us or... if someone else knows about us... It's okay, we don't have to be ashamed. There's no need to be afraid. I love you, Pie. I'm not ready, Kim. I don't want to tell anyone. Do you understand me, Kim? Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim. Here, try this. Our latest cake recipe. Very delicious. Give it a try. Put it here, dear. Let's go to get something to eat? Where? At your dorm. I've never met your friend. Call her and ask if she would like to join us. She's not there, maybe she went back home. - Call her to be sure, okay? -Yes. Sorry. It is not possible to reach the number you have dialed at this moment. Kim. Kim. What are you afraid of? True love stands the test of time and gender. Auntie. Bad joke? Please come in. - My bathroom. -Lovely. What you did was cute. Very cute. Didn't you need to pee? Please go on. Okay. - Your room is lovely. -Isn't it? Hello. I came to borrow Pie's book. Pie, your book? Pie... your friend wants to borrow your book. Hurry. YES. Thank you. Good bye. Pie, if she didn't speak, I thought that she's a guy. Who's that? Is she from the same major? Some subjects. I have goosebumps now. She didn't do any harm, Mom. I know dear, but I think it's very disgusting. Girls pretending to be boys... and boys like to be girls. I think that society nowadays is very weird. Good thing, you aren't like that or I'd be dead by now. Those tomboys like to cut their hair short. They even speak in the masculine gender. Come on. Get up and take your medicine. Can you get UP? Come on. Don't be a baby. - Can I not take them? -No. Take them, or it'll get worse. Gimme your hand. Take them. So bratty. I'll be back to have lunch with you after the exam. Don't you have an exam this afternoon? But I'll be back here first. You'll be tired. You don't have to do that. I have a migraine. I won't be hungry. I'll have dinner with you. I'll think about that later. I won't be tired because of that... 'cause you're my girlfriend, right? Sleep well. I'll be back, okay? See you. Do you have any questions? Where is Boyd? He'll be on his own. It's the end of exams. How many subjects left? One more, but I'll finish it tomorrow. And how about Kim? Kim has a migraine. She's sleeping at the dorm. Maybe we can go to Rong Kluea this summer and do some shopping. Okay, okay. Interesting but... should we go with Van? We can save on travel expenses. I don't think we should. Shopping with a man is no fun. Why? It's not the same as a woman? I'll think about it later. You've got a good point. Pie. We'll talk later, Jane. Why? Do you and Pie have something to hide? I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you, Jane. Who did you think it was? Pie? Sorry. It is not possible to reach the number you have dialed at this moment. Auntie Inn, have you seen Pie? No, I haven't. Sit down, Kim. I'll get you some water. Kim, come talk to me right now. What was the meaning of that? I didn't know it was you. You didn't know it was me? I never thought that you'd be like this. Fine. I'll tell everyone about you and Pie. Are you crazy? Yes, I'm very crazy. You'll regret what you did to me. Have some water. Water? Fifty percent of stupid lesbians... like to create drama by attempting suicide. Kim... don't you think that I'm good enough? No, you're good. You are nice. So, why don't you love me? Love isn't that simple. If it were, then everyone would get their wishes fulfilled. Look at you and me... you love me... but I love Pie. Do you understand? Then, can I ask you to be with me? I can be with you as a friend... but not anything else. I know, I know. I feel bad enough already. Dear, have something to drink. You've been crying for an hour. Is there anything I should know? Did Van do something bad to you, dear? Mom... if I don't love Van, will you be upset? I won't, dear. Why would I? I'm not forcing you to be with him. I always see the two of you together... so I thought you're okay with him. And if... the one that I'm okay with... is not a man... will you be angry at me? I have to first apologize to you... about the day I pretended to borrow Pie's book. Actually, I'm her roommate. No wonder, you look familiar. Why did you lie about something like that? Did Pie ask you to? No, I did it myself. I happened to know that you don't like... people that look like... Okay, okay. That's enough. It's good that you understand. Pie and I are very close and... I want to ask for your permission to be with her. To be with her? I love Pie. What answer are you expecting? Knowing that... I can't accept these abnormal sexualities. You came to my house... and asked to have a relationship with my daughter. What answer do you want? Forcing me to accept it and... that I should say, "Please take care of each other. Have a good life."? Honestly, I don't think this kind of relationship will last long. But I'm serious. Okay. If you tell me that you're serious... let's see whether Pie is also serious or not. Pie, come down here. Did you hear everything your friend just said? - I'm sorry, Mom. -We can talk about it later. I want to know what happened. Nothing. Nothing happened. Kim, I'm sorry. So, do you think she's serious? I get it. There's one thing I wanted to tell you. I didn't know that was Jane. You knew I was blindfolded. There's no point explaining, right? Pie, I'll go now. When surrounded by other people you pretend that we're not in love I don't deserve to be with you, right? It's like our love has to be hidden in a dark shadow I'd like to see you brave enough for our love I'm still waiting for your love right here Please take care of her. There is a path waiting for us not far from here For one day I want you to look up at the stars and not be shy with the sky If you look down at the ground don't do it to avoid anybody's eyes You don't have to feel anything Van, I'm so sorry. For one day I want you to dare look in people's eyes and tell them that we're in love There might be no one who would understand but it's alright as long as there is you and me This is the most important thing If one day, you'd be brave enough For one day I want you to look up at the stars and not be shy with the sky If you look down at the ground don't do it to avoid anybody's eyes You don't have to feel anything For one day I want you to dare look in people's eyes and tell them that we're in love For one day I want you to look up at the stars and not be shy with the sky If you look down at the ground don't do it to avoid anybody's eyes You don't have to feel anything For one day I want you to dare look in people's eyes "One day, when you're brave enough, we'll fly together." Hi, do you remember me? Boss, there's a girl who would like to see Miss Kim. - Hello. -Hello. A friend from? From university. I would like to ask for your permission to... Are you Pie? YES. So this is the girl that caused our troublemaker... to not sleep, not eat, and not think about anything else. It's good that you came. You're cute. Please take care of her. She likes to play video games, but it's bad for her eyes. Another thing, don't ask her to cook too often because she won't study. So I... Oh, Oad... tell our troublemaker that her wife is here. I think we should take her. That's okay. A glass of wine, girl? This way. Kim has good taste. How dare you... you left your girlfriend's photo in the dorm. I'm hurt, Pie. Come on, it was no big deal. Don't be hurt. Kim... I'm sorry. I was afraid. I was confused. I was afraid of everything... afraid that my mom would be angry with me... afraid that my friends would tease me... and I was afraid of how others would see us. But now, I know that... if I'm still afraid... I'll lose you. I don't want to lose you. Is it too late? It's okay. I guess I'm too late. Pie. It's okay. I'm okay. Thank you. Thank you for having the courage to love me. Remember the butterflies story you told me about, Mom? I know what it is now. Is it love, Mom? I love you and Van, but there are no butterflies. I have never felt like I can fly. Could you give me a chance, Mom? Please give this love a chance. I want to know if it's true. I want to know if it'll make me fall to pieces... and drive me to my knees. I don't want to remain curious for the rest of my life. I want to find the answer. I love you, Mom. A thousand kisses. Hey, don't cry. Are you alright, teenager? Do you think we'll have a boy or girl for a grandchild? They are human beings. They're not fighting fish. Who knows... maybe the city will be full of fighting fish one day. All of them pregnant! Gimme a tank of them. A full tank.
