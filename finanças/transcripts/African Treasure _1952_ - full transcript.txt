(exciting music) (light music) (birds squawking) (monkey squeaking) (speaking in a foreign language) (playful music) (door knocking) Breakfast ready, bwana. What is it, Eli? I say, breakfast ready. Breakfast! Oh, thanks Eli. Coffee get cold, bwana. Not in this climate it won't. (monkey squawking) (speaking in a foreign language) (monkey chattering) (monkey clapping) Er, bwana Barnes like roast monkey? I'm afraid not, Eli. Very good bwana, tastes like pork. Well, if it tastes like pork, let's stick to pork. Bring it back, Simi. Come on. Bring it back. Now run off somewhere and play. And stay away from the kitchen. (monkey chattering) Oh, it's just as well you can't understand what he said, I'm thinking. And I'll need a new napkin. Company come, bwana. (water slooshing) (animal squawking) Hello there! Hello. Andy Barnes, I imagine. The same, and more than glad to see someone from home for a change. I'm Pat Gilroy. I imagine you guessed as much from my letter. What letter is that? Didn't you get it? I wrote you a week warning you I was coming. Well, my boy'll probably bring it in today. The mail package doesn't come this far up stream. And I only send out for mail about once a month. Have you had breakfast yet? Hours ago, before sunrise. Then you must be ready for another. Eli, set another place. Brew some fresh coffee. Yes, boss. Come in out of the sun. Thank-you. I'm hoping you'll visit here at the station a while. It's not often I get company from outside. Well, I'm afraid not this trip. I'm on sort of a stolen holiday. I want to get in a couple of weeks shooting up around Najuli, lions mostly. Man, you're traveling very light for such an expedition, I'm thinking. Well, it's only beginners that need a big safari. I'm a fairly old hand. Even so Gilroy, you can't get by with only one porter. I'm relying on you to direct me to a village where I can pick up a few natives. Ah, there's only one such I can recommend and it's a hard day's travel from here. Mr. Gilroy will be spending the night with us, Eli. And in the morning I want you to guide him up stream to Namgola's Village. Yes boss. I'm rather anxious to get started, Mr. Barnes. If you could tell me where this village... You'd never find it, man. It's hidden way up on one of those streams. [Radio Operator] G42 commissioner's office, Nairobi, calling Andrew Barnes, GX1. Shortwave. It never fails. If I'm having a meal or under the shower. [Radio Controller] Commissioner's office, Nairobi, calling Deputy Barnes, please acknowledge. Please excuse me. Certainly. And get on with your food while it's edible. [Radio Controller] G42, commissioner's office, Nairobi, calling GX1. Commissioner's office calling Deputy Barnes. Acknowledge please. (radio whistling) GX1, Barnes speaking, go ahead commissioner. I believe the government geological party passed through your territory a couple of months ago, heading for the Najuli Mountain area. Yes sir, a professor Gatesby and two assistants. They left by motorboat to Sebastian's Landing to pick up Pedro Sebastian as guide. [Radio Controller] Any word from them since that time? No sir. - Why do you ask? - The police have just learned that two of the party are members of DeHaven's diamond running gang. But how could DeHaven's men get into government service? [Radio Controller] They had forged references. I suggest you make an immediate investigation. - Shall I make arrests? - Use your own judgment. You've full power to act but do it fast. That is all. (radio switch clicking) (animal squawking) (door thumping) Eli, you recall the party that passed through here a couple of months back? Yes, bwana. Have you heard anything about them from the native boys? I heard they go to Namgola village for supply boy, that's all. Call Sebastian's Landing Eli. Yes, boss. Is there anything I can do to help, Mr. Barnes? Nothing thanks. I'm likely to go to Namgola's village with you. GX1 calling Sebastian Landing, answer please. (radio switch clicking) GX1 calling Sebastian Landing, answer please. (radio switch clicking) On second thought, maybe I could use you. Tackling two of DeHaven's men single handed will be no picnic. DeHaven, isn't he in jail? I'm sure I read about him a couple of days before I left. Aye, he's in jail. But his crew are not, and they're a hard lot. Nobody answered, bwana. Very strange. Somebody always at Landing. Mrs. Sebastian, number one boy, somebody. Well, I'll have to go to Namgola's I guess. But I hate to do it without more information. You think maybe Bomba knows something? That's a thought. He'd know if anyone would. Can you reach him? I can try bwana, I've done before. (speaking in a foreign language) Who is this Bomba you just mentioned, a native packer? I don't know how to answer that. Bomba's a white lad. He grew up in the jungle with the animals, knows them, talks their language. Oh, you're not serious? Ah, I know the lad. He visits me at times, but he prefers his own way of... (drums beating) What's that? Jungle telegram. Oh. (animals twittering) (speaking in a foreign language) (drums beating) (lively music) (leaves rustling) (Kimbbo grunting) (water splashing) (Kimbbo chattering) (Kimbbo squealing) (exciting music) (Kimbbo chattering) (lion grunting) (ominous music) (animal squawking) (dramatic music) (lion growling) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (lion roaring) (dramatic music) (lion growling) Help him, Tolu, help him. (suspenseful music) (brush rustling) (tense music) Who is he? Name Bomba, men say he jungle devil. Nonsense, he's a white boy. Does he speak English? Not know missy, live with animal, talk with animal. Get some basana leaves Tolu. - He's hurt badly. - Yes, missy. (Kimbbo grunting) (Kimbbo chattering) Who are you? You do speak English. I am glad. Now I thank... who are you? What are you doing here in the jungle? I, I live here. At Sebastian's Landing. My father is a guide, Pedro Sebastian. My name is Lita. Does your father always let you go into the jungle alone this way? He doesn't know. He's away on safari, and I'm worried about him. Father been gone too long, not send word back. You think you can find him in the jungle? (laughing) No. I, I'm going to Namgola's village. He got his safari boys there. Maybe they have heard from him. I go with you. You don't have to. I know where the village is. I like Lita, it is not safe for her to be in jungle with guard who walks in his sleep. (speaking in a foreign language) (Kimbbo grunting) (speaking in a foreign language) I'm sending my friends through the jungle. Maybe they can find out about your father. (animals squawking) Come, we go now. (drums beating) What is it? Barnes bwana, say he want to talk to Bomba. About your father. (speaking in a foreign language) (stick banging) What are you looking for Tolu? Bomba has found. (drums beating) We go now. The message is on the way to my friend. (animals squawking) Message come from Bomba. I heard it, what'd he say? He say, have got young woman. Young woman? What young woman? Not know bwana. Say will tell more when get to Namgola village. Better let him know we got the message. (radio whistling) GX1 calling G42 Nairobi. Barnes calling commissioner. Answer please. [Radio Operator] G42 here, go ahead please. I got word to a friend in the Najuli district. He reports he has found a young woman. You said nothing about a woman being mixed up in this. [Radio Operator] There isn't so far as I know. We'll know more about it when he reports in from Namgola's village. He's on his way there now. (tense music) What is it Bomba? The village looks dead. Witches, Congo devils. My father came here for safari boy. No one's been here for weeks. Namgola must have moved his tribe to another village. They wouldn't do that without their weapons. Search huts, that may tell us something. Tolu very afraid missy. Dead village very bad. Did you find anything? Yes, Namgola is inside. He's dead. Could the village have been wiped out by a plague. No, there's been fighting. Namgola was shot. Fighting. Then something may have happened to my father. I don't know, but Namgola was my friend. Someone killed him and I must find out who did it. (dramatic music) It is one of my father's party. Missy, Bomba, look! They didn't even bury them to keep them from the vultures. But what has happened to the white men? It was the white men that killed the natives. But my father was with them. You don't think that he... No time to think. Must get more proof first. The tracks lead this way. (suspenseful music) The white men killed the natives. Then left on foot. Why do you say that? How can you know? They hid the boat so they could have it when they return. Then we can follow their trail. Trail too old. All covered with vines now. But we've got to find them Bomba, we've got to. - (animals squawking) - Shh. My friends are coming. (branches rustling) (Kimbbo grunting) What have you found there Kimbbo? (speaking in a foreign language) They found the party. What about your father? Wait. (speaking in a foreign language) The men are at a mountain off that way. I think he means Old Crater, the natives call Najuli. I know the place. I've been there with my father. You have to go in through a... Hold it, just the way you are. Have your native drop that gun. Do as he says Tolu. (gun firing) Get away from that gun. I'll try to get away so I can help you. (gun firing) Argh! (dramatic music) (speaking in a foreign language) Come back here. Get over there. What have you done with my father? Not a thing, I'm gonna take you to him. Where's your friend think he was going? For help of course. (laughing) Where does he expect to find it? Who was he anyway? He's a boy who was raised among the animals. A jungle boy hey. Am I supposed to believe that? You'll find out for yourself. If you haven't killed him, he'll be back. Not much chance of that. You heard him yell when I fired. He won't be back. (speaking in a foreign language) (water bubbling) Come on, come on. (Speaking in a foreign language) Now we'll go visit your father. Follow him. Get over there. (suspenseful music) (Kimbbo grunting) (speaking in a foreign language) (ominous music) (drum beating) Hold it? What's that. The natives call it a talking drum. I think it is a call for help. But there's no one in the village to send it. Maybe you missed the jungle boy. Go on, keep moving. (Kimbbo chattering) (drums beating) (water slooshing) [Eli] Mail bwana. (drums beating) From Bomba. Yes, bwana. Say Namgola village been attacked. One white man killed, many natives. Send help to village. He will follow white man. No more. Have the boys put food in the canoes. Then have them come here to get the guns. Yes, bwana. (radio clicking) GX1 calling G42 Nairobi. Deputy Barnes calling commissioner at Nairobi. Answer please. (gun firing) You er, shouldn't have opened this while I was watching. get up Mr. Barnes. You're going to guide me to that village without your native boys. I've already told them that they... I know what you told them, but you can tell them you've changed your mind, and make it convincing. I can refuse you know. Yes you can refuse. I imagine Eli would guide me if he saw me get rid of you the hard way. Come on. Oh, just a minute. You'll look funny without a gun. Here. You won't need any cartridges. Go on. News already bwana, got food and water. I er, I've changed my mind Eli. Mr. Gilroy and I are going alone. Three men paddle faster than two bwana. If the men give us the slip, we'll want someone to wireless the commissioner. Better send word to Bomba that help is on the way. (guns clattering) (speaking in a foreign language) (water splashing) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (playful music) (suspenseful music) (playful music) Run Lita! (dramatic music) (Kimbbo grunting) (coconut thumping) (gun firing) (speaking in a foreign language) (tense music) (light music) (animals squawking) (tense music) They're heading toward Najuli crater. But what for? There's nothing there but rocks. It's supposed to be a secret. But my father discovered a deposit of kimberlite in the crater and he reported it to the government. Kimberlite, what's that? It's a sort of blueish clay. But sometimes they find diamonds in it. (Kimbbo grunting) (ominous music) (water slooshing) Hey, hey. (tense music) (speaking in a foreign language) (brush crunching) (drums beating) An answer to my message. Helps coming. Had we better go back and wait for them? They won't be here 'til tomorrow. We better make sure what these men are hiding. (speaking in a foreign language) (wheel chugging) (fist thumping) - That's my father. - Shh. (fist thumping) You can't help him, not yet. What's this about, Hardy? Right after you left we hit the riches pocket in the diggings. He's deliberately letting half the stones slip through with the waste. You get back to work. And this time do it right. When I get out of this hole, you will wish you had never set eyes on Pedro Sebastian. What makes you think you're ever gonna get out. Shut up, Hardy, you talking too much. Now clean off that table and lay on more oil. I was right, they have found diamonds. That is why they came to the boat for the oil. Why? The diamonds stick to the oil on the table. The rest of the dirt rolls off. What do you think of these? Oh, we must have two pounds of the stones already. Yeah, and we'll have twice that much when we clean up with one pocket. Come on. Look Hardy, we better take what we got and beat it while we have a chance. You're out of your mind. We're gonna wait for DeHaven. We can't dispose of the stones without his help. I know but I ran into a little trouble this morning. - The law? - No, but the Sebastian girl's starting to search for her father. Well, let them hunt. They'll never find us up here. I'm not so sure. She had a young fellow with her, a sort of jungle boy and... - A what? - A boy that grew up in the jungle with the animals. He can follow a trail like a beagle hound. I knew you were getting jumpy but I didn't think you'd try to sell me a bill of goods like that to get me to pull out. It's fact, Hardy. I caught the girl, I had to kill a native. I thought I'd got the jungle boy too but I must've missed. Anyway, he caught up with me and got the girl away from me. And what's worse, he sent out a call for help. Don't tell me he carries a shortwaves set. Didn't you ever hear a jungle telegraph, talking drums. Talking drums, SOS, jungle boys. You really expect me to swallow that eyewash. You may have to. (gravel scraping) You can stay if you like, Hardy, I'm taking my share and pulling out. Oh no, you're not. This is a two-man job. I can't handle it alone. I'm sorry, my hide means more to me than an extra handful of diamonds. I'd hate to have any serious trouble with you, now that we're so near the cleanup. But if that's the way you want it. Don't be a fool, Greg. Even if the law found us, one man in that whole-in-the-wall could stand them off forever. Yeah, I suppose he could at that. Somebody ought to stand guard now. That's a good idea. Go ahead. Come. So is it true as the native tells me. The jungle boy has found your trail and he's coming with help. I believe that when I see it. By then it will be too late, senor. (exciting music) (Kimbbo grunting) We'll stay here 'til dark, and then I'll slip inside and try to... They're going to keep a guard at the entrance. And I can't get close enough to him without being seen. Could you perhaps go above him? No, the walls are too steep and there's no cover. I know another way into the crater, if I can find it again. (tense music) We're almost out of water. I'm going down after some more. Good. On second thought, maybe you'd better go after. Why me, I already made the trip once today. You might not be here when I got back. All right, come on. (metal canister clattering) I think it's somewhere near here. What is it you're looking for? Somewhere around here is an underground stream that leads into the mountain. (speaking in a foreign language) (stick banging) Why don't we go back to the village and wait for your friends? Those men are frightened. They know I sent for help. They may not be here when we get back. They have to go back to the village for their boat. We could catch them there. What good will that do the prisoners? Do you think they'll leave them alive to tell what they know? You don't mean they'd kill them? Maybe they won't get the chance if I can find that stream. (stick thumping) (Kimbbo screaming) (exciting music) (Kimbbo grunting) I think he's found it. (light music) (stick thumping) Sounds hollow, I think this is it. (water splashing) (tense music) This is it, I can feel the current. It goes underground to a place where I can climb to the crater. (speaking in a foreign language) He'll meet me on top. You go back to the village. Bring friends when they come. But Bomba, you can't leave me alone. Bomba, Bomba, Bomba, Bomba. Woo. Bomba! (speaking in a foreign language) (exciting music) (ominous music) Where's the jungle boy? I do not know, senor. Don't give me that, I heard you talking to him. - Where is he? - Please, I don't know. He went under the water right there. What for? He may have heard you coming, did not say. Well he can't stay down forever. (exciting music) (water slooshing) (speaking in a foreign language) Come on, hurry up. (metal canisters clanking) (exciting music) (ominous music) (speaking in a foreign language) Follow them men. You are not going to wait for the jungle boy? I said get going. (exciting music) (tense music) (water slooshing) Lita. Why you bring her here? She can do you no good with with this. She can't do us any harm either, so long as she's cooped up here with the rest of you. How did you happen to find her? She was down by the river. I heard her talking things over with the jungle boy and I figured... you can skip that part of it. I'm still not buying any of that jungle boy. No, well I brought this along to show you. Is this on the level? Is there really such a thing as a jungle boy? Ask your natives? By now he's probably half way to the village for help. You let him get away again. I didn't even see him. I only heard him talking. When I got where I could see he'd already gone. Well that's bad. Bad, it means we've got to pull out, right now. We'll probably meet DeHaven somewhere along the river. It'll be dark in less than an hour. We can't go stumbling through the jungle in the dark. I'm not going to stay here so they can walk in and trap us. They can't travel by night either. We're pulling out at daylight. (spear smashing) Look, we're gonna work right up to the time we leave. (spear clattering) You can take Sebastian's place at the table. (ax clanking) How did all this happen? After we found the diamonds in the crater, we returned to the village to send back our report. These men attacked us and I was knocked out. When I came to, Kaji was dead. So was Namgola and many of his people. The rest of us were prisoners as you see. When they leave tomorrow, what will they do with us? I do not know. Bomba says they would dare not leave us alive. I'm sorry you know that. We can only pray he will arrive in time with help. (ominous music) Any chance of getting to that village by nightfall? We'll be lucky if we reach it by noon tomorrow. Then turn into shore, we'll make camp for the night. (suspenseful music) (animals squawking) - (dramatic music) - Hey hey, what what are you, what's, what is the idea, what's the meaning of this? - Eli! - Yes, bwana. Go to village now. Daylight come soon. How did you know I was in trouble Eli? Found man's picture in basket bwana. (animals squawking) (ominous music) (speaking in a foreign language) (suspenseful music) (speaking in a foreign language) (dramatic music) (tense music) Come on, shovel that stuff up there, shovel it. (speaking in a foreign language) How're we doing? I'm too tired to know. Let's call it off. It's nearly daylight and I've got to get to sleep. All right. Help me put them to bed. (speaking in a foreign language) Come on, come on. (tense music) (speaking in a foreign language) What does that mean? They tie our hands every night. And one is always on guard to make sure we do not escape. (Kimbbo grunting) You better get some sleep. I'll stand watch 'til daybreak. (suspenseful music) (tense music) When you leave the crater, senor, what do you intend to do with us? I wouldn't worry about that. What you don't know won't hurt you. That is not always true, senor. (playful music) (gun clattering) (exciting music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (Kimbbo grunting) (gun firing) (Kimbbo squealing) (fists thumping) Hold it Greg. He declared himself in on this. Now let him ride it out with the others. Well, it's too late to get any sleep. I'm going up to start the landslide so we can get out of here. Go ahead, I'll take care of things down here. (ominous music) What was the landslide you spoke of, senor? That will hide the tunnel so no one will find it. We may want to come back someday. (water rippling) Bomba, are you awake? Yes. Where are the men? One is outside. The other has gone above the tunnel to start a landslide. Can you rollover and touch my hands? See if you can untie them. (suspenseful music) [Lita] Oh it's no use. They're too tight. (Kimbbo grunting) (speaking in a foreign language) Untie your father and others. (dramatic music) (grunting) (ominous music) (Pedro moaning) Lita, get the others untied. (tense music) (dramatic music) Lita, quickly! (exciting music) (rocks crashing) (dramatic music) (fist thumping) (branch cracking) (gun firing) (tense music) (ominous music) (tense music) (rocks crumbling) Half the mountain is piled between us and the outside. We could never dig through it. Bomba will bring help and get us out. Unless he was caught in the landslide himself. You don't believe that. I don't want to, but we better not count on outside help. Get shovels and picks. (speaking in a foreign language) Surely you don't expect to dig through here. The mountain is a half a mile thick. At least, but it's broken up into a thousand crevices. This is one of them that got filled with clay. It may run clear through the hill or it may come out in an open crevice. You believe it does? We can only hope that it does. If it does not then... (rock tapping) What is that tapping noise? The men digging in the tunnel. No, it, it sounds as if it's coming through the wall. Bomba, Bomba. (rocks tapping) (metal clattering) Nevermind the bedrolls, we'll have to move fast to reach the boat ahead of that jungle boy's cry for help. (diamonds clattering) (pensive music) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (exciting music) We better take it at a trap from here on in. Well I can't Hardy, I'm out of my feet. Get this straight, Greg, if you're not with me when I reach that boat, I'm pulling out without you. But Hardy, I... (tense music) (dramatic music) (pensive music) (tense music) Hey Hardy, wait for me! (exciting music) (boat engine cranking) I thought you'd make it. (boat engine revving) (tense music) We must be getting close to the village aren't we Eli? Big bend in river, a couple of miles ahead. Village just around the bend. (engine rumbling) Look bwana, motorboat. (dramatic music) (guns firing) (water splashing) (gasping) (exciting music) (tense music) (pensive music) What is it, Bomba, are you hurt? No, only tired. I don't know about him. Better get his gun. How did you get out of the cave? My father found a way out. I'm glad. Watch him, Eli. Is he hurt, Pedro? There is nothing the matter with him that a little rest will not cure. Now then, Bomba lad, let's have it. What have you been mixed up in this time? I think father can tell you better than I can. All right, Pedro. Professor Gatesby is dead. So is Namgola and many of his people. These men killed them, and took us as prisoners to the crater to mine diamonds. (engine rumbling) (exciting music) When we get Bomba home, we must find a way to reward him for all he has done for us. Yes Lita. Where has he gone? Bomba, Bomba. I'm afraid it's no use, lass. He slipped quietly back to the life he loves and the friends he knows best. But he left without even saying goodbye. Aye, he has no use for goodbyes, and maybe he's right. They're empty things at best, and only leave a hurt on both sides. (engine revving) (romantic music) (exciting music)
