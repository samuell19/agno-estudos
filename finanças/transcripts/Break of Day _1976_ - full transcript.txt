(thunder cracks) (energetic drum music) (waves slosh) - [Coxswain] Begging your pardon, sir, but we seem to be closing onto the picket boat to port. 150 yards apart for the order, sir. - [Captain] I'm aware of that, Coxswain, but I'd rather bend the order than lose touch. Are the bowmen taking regular soundings? - [Coxswain] Aye, sir. It's coming up light. Looks quiet enough ahead. - [Captain] Mmm. They must have heard us. - Hull catching bottom, sir. - [Captain] Stop engines. Prepare to let go aft. - [Coxswain] Prepare to let go aft. - [Captain] Half a stand together. Let go aft. (waves slosh) - [Coxswain] Good luck. - [Captain] Out oars. Prepare to pull handsomely, give away together. Stroke, stroke. Stroke. Stroke. stroke. Stroke. Stroke. (gull squawks) Stroke. Stroke.

Hello. - I'm sorry, I didn't know that-- - Course, you weren't to know. I didn't bother to lock it, seemed no need. - No, it's pretty quiet. - Except for the birds. They woke me up, actually. Must be very early. - Yes, it is. - Do you come here every morning? - Sometimes. - The agent didn't mention you. You must be the owner of the rabbit traps. - Yes. - Do you trap for a living? - No, not really. - They were very smelly. Kept tripping over them, they were all over the floor. Anyway, they're all out there. - The foxes have taken most of them. - I'm sorry. - Nobody's ever rented this place before, not this late in the season. - Always a first time for everything. - I don't use the traps anymore. - My name's Alice Hughes. - Tom Cooper. - [Alice] I've come up here to paint. - There's a shed by the side. Do you mind if I use that to keep my things in? - [Alice] Not at all. - See, the hills are full of burrows, and-- - No, it's all right. - Well, it saves me carrying everything from home. - Of course. Good morning, Tom. - Morning. (cockatoo squawks) - Mrs. Cooper's tray is ready, Mr. Cooper. - Thank you, Susan. (door opens) Beth? Beth. Good morning, darling. - Hello. - [Tom] How are you feeling? - Oh, good. I'm feeling good. - Here you are. I'll see you at lunchtime. - Thank you. - Look after yourself. - Yes, all right. Goodbye. (gags) (coughs) - The agent had no business renting it to you now. Our local butter is very good, Riverdue. - Good, I'll try it. - Fishing parties. - Oh, and I'd like some cocoa. - We keep that place for fishing parties. The scallions cook up very good, all gold. And there's Bushells. That's very popular at the moment. - That'll be lovely. Thank you. - Still, what's done's done. Anything else? - [Alice] Just a bottle of brandy, thank you. - No French, of course, not since the war. - Australian will do nicely. Splendid. - I'm not the man to slide out of my contractual obligations. Anything further? - No, thank you. Oh yes, there is something else. I wanted some linseed oil. - [Lou] Oh, I sold the last half-pint last week. - Oh dear. - None in till next week. The newspaper office down the street will have some. They might sell you a little. You can start an account if you like. - All right. - Down the street, across the road from the Royal. - [Alice] Thank you. - Not at all. Good morning. - Good morning. (baby cries) (whimsical music) (typewriter keys click) (bell chimes) Well, we meet again. - Yes. - I had no idea. - Can I help you? - I want some... They told me at the store you stock linseed oil. - Well, we don't sell... For your paintings? - Yes. - Just a moment. John, I want some linseed oil. - How much, Mr. Cooper? - Half a gallon. Should keep you going for a while. - How much will that be? - I've no idea, we don't usually-- - Well, I must pay, really. - No, that's all right. Compliments of the firm. - Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye. - [Tom] Goodbye. (door closes) - The lead story. I've had him set those sentences you marked separate as running pass. Your poor old father always said, "A sentence is a sentence, a paragraph's a paragraph." So I've run them on, following house style. - Of course. (dog barks) (bell tolls) (children chatter) - Done ya. G'day. - Hello. - Nice day? - Yes. - What's your name? - Miss, Miss Hughes. What's yours? - Billy. Ta ta. - Bye bye. - Camped out at Fogerty's. - How do you know? - Everyone knows. Probably a witch. Or else she's on the game. - [Boy] What game? (foreboding music) - Can I give you a lift, ma'am? - Thank you. - Warm and dusty day to be walking. - Yes. (clicks tongue) - How far you going? - I'm renting a little cottage near the river. Fogerty's, I think they call it. - Old Fogerty was a miner here. 40, 50 year ago. More of a fossicker, really. Scratching around the old workings and heaps of talons. Washing out the odd bit of colour. He was a fair terror for the drink. One night he got drunk as a lord down the local, then decided to walk home. While picking his way as best he can, barely able to put one foot in front of the other, let alone find the right path, suddenly there was a thump. Fogerty was out like a light. Anyway, when he wakes up, he's flat out on his back, staring straight up a long black hole, a little patch of moonlit sky way up above him. All around him in the darkness is cold stone. Course, Fogerty knew what had happened. He'd stumbled down a mine shaft and been knocked unconscious. He carefully felt himself all over, no bones broken. Then he started climbing. Hand over hand up that shaft. Slipping and sliding, hanging on for grim death. He was at it most of the night. By the time he'd pulled himself out of the top, it was just getting light. Then suddenly, clang, Fogerty's out again. Well, two days later, they found him outside his own hut, unable to move, raging in a fever. What had actually happened was Fogerty had got home, but he'd gone to sleep with his head in that big fireplace, and he'd spent the rest of the night climbing his own chimney. Then when he'd pulled himself out at the top, he fell off the roof and broke both legs. Well, that's one version of the story. Course, others will tell you that he fell off the roof, broke his neck and died, and his ghost still comes back and haunts that hut. Whoa, Jen. But if that's what happened, how does anyone know about him climbing the chimney? And who'd have told them? That track there will take you through to Fogerty's hut. - Thank you. - Later. (patrons chatter) - A paragraph is a paragraph, and a sentence is a sentence. - Seen the new one yet? - A paragraph is a distinct passage dealing with a particular point. - Painting lady, renting for-- - It's not just a convenient place to break up a slab of type just to make a page look pretty. - [Joe] Gave her a lift this morning. - [Evans] A paragraph has a purpose, and that's that. Even if it keeps going the length of a full column. - Artist is she? - So she says. - [Evans] So long as it's making the one particular point, well, it shouldn't be broken. - [Joe] Seemed very nice. - And a paragraph most definitely isn't a sentence. - [Robbie] Lonely spot, Fogerty's. - A sentence is a single thought. - [Lou] Doesn't seem to worry her. - One single thought. (cash register chimes) - Be pretty broad-minded, being an artist. - They're the rules. - Broad mind, broad hips. - There have to be rules. - Big ass, loose lips. (laughs) - Rules about everything. Any man that breaks the rules does so at his own risk. - [Joe] Seemed rather pleasant, I thought. (men laugh) (serene music) - I wasn't sick this morning. That's the first time. Tom? - Hm? - I wasn't sick this morning. - That's good. - Ruby came over this afternoon. We sorted through Paul's old baby things. Some of them are very nice. Ruby's mother does the loveliest crocheting. Ruby says she'll ask her to make me a shawl. Tom? - That'll be nice. - You haven't been listening, have you? Have you? Is there something wrong? - No, no. - Old Evans again. - No more than usual. - You haven't gone out in the mornings lately. Has your foot-- - No, my foot hasn't been hurting. It doesn't hurt. It just gets in the bloody way, but it doesn't hurt! Ever. - My. When we were children, my father used to sit in his chair reading the paper. It seemed like all night. And he wouldn't listen to anything we were saying. If we really wanted to tell him something, we'd have to practically shout. When we finally did get through to him, he'd look over his glasses, and he'd say very crossly, "Do what?" Seems funny now. But it didn't at the time. The morning sickness part might be over. I hope so. - [Alice] What do you do with them? - [Tom] You're about early. - Usually, you caught me the other morning. Travelling makes me tired. I've missed you. You said you came here most mornings. - Most mornings I do. - What do you do with them? - Well, it was good pocket money when I was a kid. The skins, I mean. Now I just... The wall of that shed's practically lined with them. Might do something with them one day. - What do you do with the rest? - Carcass, not much. Might take one home for next door's dog. Beth doesn't... Well, we don't eat them at home. Mostly I just bury them. Would you like one? They're not bad eating. - Yes. Yes, all right. Thanks. Why do you kill them? - I've always had a few traps along these hills. Long as I can remember. A few quiet hours with no one. Besides, they're vermin. There you are, underground chicken. Stewed or baked, whichever you prefer. - Thank you. - [Tom] You got somewhere to keep it, away from the flies? - [Alice] I'll cook it today. - [Tom] Would be best if you let it hang for a few days. You haven't got anywhere to keep meat? - No, I haven't. I'm afraid I'm not very well equipped. (hammering) (serene music) You never cease to amaze me. A complete camper. (dramatic music) Has your family always lived here? - Yes, my grandfather founded the newspaper at the height of the gold rush. Old Evans taught me the trade. My father taught me to write. Or tried to. But no one taught me the business. My father died whilst I was away. The old invincible runs right under us, right through this hill. (ominous music) They took out 1500 ounces of fine gold in two years. (bugle playing The Last Post) - And mud. Struth the mud was bad. (chattering) You try fighting hand to hand with a bayonet with mud up to your waist, and see how long you last. Could work out where the shells were falling by the way the flamin' great spouts of mud fell up. Anyway, before I knew a thing, the whole side of the slip trench started fallin' in. Caught me just as I was standing up, then buried me completely, from head to toe. I could feel the stuff on top, pushing my tin hat down, forcing my chin down onto my chest. The brim of the tin hat kept the stuff out of my nose, but the weight on top kept pushing it further down my head. And that band thing around the inside kept slipping down my nose, scraping the skin off with it. Then I started to struggle like fury again. Although I could move around a little at first, mud was really starting to set. Pretty soon I was stuck fast and couldn't move a fraction. Then I thought I'd have to stop breathing. I could hardly move my ribs. Was just like a flaming iron band was clamped around my chest, squeezin' in. (man coughs) Wouldn't have been as bad as the gas, of course. (wheezes) Well, when I'd just about given it all up, heard the Sergeant Major yelling, "Quick, two! Men with shovels!" They had to take it pretty carefully. It's easy to injure a man diggin' him out. Well, they got it all off me in the end. It's just like comin' back to life again. But it hurt every time I drew a breath for a few days after that. (men laugh) (men chatter) Should get that fella finished, if the weather holds. - [Robbie] How about some service, Lou? - Yeah, coming. (gun fires) (gentle piano music) (gun fires) (gun fires) (men chatter) - Tom. Where have you... - [Alice] Tom? - Hello. - [Alice] Come over here. - I brought you some fish. - Come over here. Sit down. - [Tom] I brought you some fish. - Thank you. - They're fresh, I just took them out of the drum net. I cleaned them. (dramatic music) - I want to paint you. Want to paint your portrait. - Not... Not like this. - No. I want you dressed in those old army clothes. The true spirit of Anzac. (dramatic music) (whimsical music) - Sean. Stop it! You're late this morning, Mr. Cooper. Been fishing out at Fogerty's, have you, Mr. Cooper? Did you catch anything, Mr. Cooper? The only thing he'd be catching out there is crabs. - Susan, I'm running a bit late, so I thought just a piece of toast. (sizzling) - Go and sit down. I'll bring it through. There, isn't that nice? Breakfast together for once. - Yes, it's lovely. - See, I'm not totally helpless. Dr. Harvey said everything is quite normal and exactly how it should be. - That's good. - I'll get these quick little pains, contractions, regularly spaced. I've got to time them. When they get to five minutes apart, you've got to call him. The baby is upside-down in the womb, facing the side, and as it comes down, the head turns, first to the back, then to the side again. Isn't it marvellous? You don't mind, do you, Tom? Me telling you? - No, no, of course not. - Dr. Harvey's very modern. He thinks the patient should know exactly what she's in for. - [Susan] Shall I serve the tea now, Mrs. Cooper? - Yes, thank you, Susan. (serene music) (birds chirp) (giggles) (clock ticking) - Morning. - Morning. Fred's out of copy. It is publication day, you know. (press rattles) - [Tom] The council story goes in there. That should wind it up. - Won't fit. - [Tom] Then we'll cut it. Can't be more than an inch or two over. - Look for yourself. - It's all been set intro, black caps. I forgot to mark it 7.5, caps and lowercase. It's an easy enough thing to do. He should have queried it. This stuff's always set light every week! Should have used his brains. - You're the one supposed to have the brains, not him. It's his job to follow copy, nothing more. - Follow copy? Even if it blows out of the bloody window? It's too late to reset, so drop a house ad in there. - What if it won't fit? - Then recut the bloody borders until it does! (sighs) - This is an unexpected bonus. I really ought to drive you away. You're keeping me from my work. You manage very well for a cripple. (twig snaps) What was that? - [Tom] What was what? - There was a noise in the bushes over there. - I don't know, wallaby I suppose. There's a few around here. They won't mind. They're broadminded, wallabies. (laughs) - Before we went to Gallipoli, we were camped in Egypt. Go to Cairo on leave. One night a lot of the troops, Australians, New Zealanders, set fire to the brothels. It was Good Friday. I saw them burning in Azbekeya Street, thousands of troops watching. They were throwing pianos out of the windows. The soldiers stopped the firemen doing anything about it. I asked one of our chaps why they were doing it, and he said, he said he didn't know. The Battle of the Wazzir, they called it. - Why did they do such a thing? - Someone said they were retrieving the honour of thousands of young allied soldiers. We were all confined to camp for a few days. Then we learnt that seven girls had been burned to death. (sombre music) (rattling) (ominous music) - Tom. Feel anything? - It's jumping about. - Kicking. - Feels funny. - It's nice. Tom. - Better not. Not with the baby in. - The baby will be all right, Tom. If you're very careful. (rain patters) (thunder cracks) (laughs) (thunder rumbles) (rattling) - Listen. - It's only possums. Making love. (clattering) - [Alice] Only possums. - Big possums. (rustling) (clanging) Bounce up and down. - Pardon? (shushes) - The bed, bounce up and down. (bed squeaks) (yelps) - Mr. Cooper! Please don't hit me no more, Mr. Cooper! Please don't hit me no more!

I was getting some extra blankets for the spare bed. I was shifting it to the spare room. - [Tom] What for? - I... You've probably noticed I haven't been sleeping very well. I seem to be tossing and turning all night. I must be disturbing you. And besides, with the baby almost due, I don't want you... (door closes) (cries) (chatting) - [Joe] Barely touched the side. - Warm day for the time of the year. Could be an early summer, by the look of it. - Just so long as we don't get any rain before the weekend. We want the recreation ground right for the brewery picnic. - How do you think they'll go? - Not a hope. Might have had a chance before the war when young Tom Cooper was playing. Not now. - Tom Cooper mightn't be all right for playing cricket, but he's performing well in a few other directions. - [Evans] Tom! Programme for the picnic. - Looks all right to me.
