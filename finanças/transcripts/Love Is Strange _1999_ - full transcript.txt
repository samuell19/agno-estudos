(DEAN SPEAKING IN THE DISTANCE) (KATHRYN GIGGLING) KATHRYN: We're gonna sink! TOM: Could you move? DEAN: ...strive to ensure the blessings of the law to our society. Today, you join them in their task. You have learned the law. Where is she? DEAN: But what must sustain you now, is the moral code from which it springs. (ALL APPLAUDING) KATHRYN: (WHISPERING) Oh, my God! Look! Oh, my God, they finished! (BOTH MUMBLING) DEAN: Brian Adams. TOM: Thanks, it was good for me, too. -Quiet, or they'll see us. (KATHRYN EXCLAIMS) KATHRYN: Don't splash me! TOM: I'm doing the best I can! KATHRYN: My mother is gonna kill me if I miss this thing. (SIGHS) How could she do this to me? Oh! There she is. There she is! Almost, almost! Ah! (YELPS) KATHRYN: Your hat! Your hat! Your hat! (BOTH SCREAM) (GASPS) Don't fall in! Don't... (WHISPERS) Get your shoe! This is so embarrassing. Nobody's looking at you, dear. DEAN: James Seller. Jay Circa. PRIEST: Do you, Thomas Ainsworth, take Kathryn McClain to be your lawfully wedded wife... (SOBBING) To hold and to cherish in sickness and in health, until death do you part? Yeah, I... Yeah, I guess so. (SOBS) I, I just don't, you know, I don't want to back her into a corner... (SOBBING CONTINUES) Look, Kat, I want to marry you but it doesn't feel right if it's forced. I never didn't want to, and why wouldn't I want to less now? Huh? That was a little less than clear. Look, Kat, I love you, I'll do my part... Unless you've decided that... You... I love you, too. I absolutely want to. I do. It's his turn. It's your turn. Oh, yeah, I do, too. Notch me, Daddy, notch me. (DOORBELL RINGS) Just a minute, Mother. Tom? Hold on, honey, Mom will get it. (DOORBELL RINGS) Okay, darling. Stand up straight. Stand up straight, honey. That's it, perfect. I got it. Now go open the door for Mamaw, and Mom will write the date. Go on, honey. (RINGING CONTINUES) Tom, you need to get your stuff out of there. Mom has to set up for Mikey's party. Hey there, little birthday boy. Ooh! How does it feel to be four? Big. Oh. (CHUCKLES) KATHRYN: I'll be done with these depositions and back here by five. Did you pick up the C-A-K-E? Cake, Mommy? (LAUGHING) Oh, cute. Tom? Tom? Mmm. What? Did you get the cake? Ugh! (EXHALES) Honey, I'm trying to keep these kids out of jail, they're counting on me. Maybe Mikey should get himself arrested. I'm going to be back really soon and we're going to have a great party, okay? Okay. See you soon! Let's get ready for your birthday party. (KNOCKING) It's open. I don't know why I ever bother to give you a day off. Hi, Benjamin. Remember Daryl Cook? You defended him. Convenience store, threatened the clerk with a jar of acid. Which turned out to be apple juice. Well, he used a gun this time. He's been bounced out of juvy into adult. Biggest idiot craze since the hula-hoop. Well, what do you want me to work on, Mincey or the kid? I want you to argue it. It's already on the calendar. Okay. Whose court is it? Marion Hopkins. I can handle that. Oh, come on Marion. Since when did Morris ever invite you to anything more than lunch? After a few months, things move along. You'd know that if you ever dated anyone more than twice. Well, what kind of date can you possibly have on a Monday morning? He's taking me to his cabin. Cabin? That's not a date, that's a proposal. Well, I don't want to have him drive me back on Sunday night. Well then, take two cars. Oh, come on, Kathryn. I know your calendar's clear on Monday, I checked. Look, I'm having Thanksgiving at your mother's. That's got to be worth something. I mean, one case, Kathryn! KATHRYN: Are you sure it was 11? SYLVIA: Of course I'm sure. Eleven was the perfect fit, I measured it. KATHRYN: But did you count the bushes when you put them in? Because the nursery could have miscounted them. Florence planted a single azalea at the end of her driveway the next day! Mother, you know as well as I do you can't swing a cat in this city without hitting an azalea. All I know is I had 11, now I have 10. And she has one. Well, did you say something to her? I can't accuse the minister's wife of stealing. We could go get it back. Don't encourage her. SYLVIA: Dinner is served now. It will be absolutely ruined cold. What's with all the tags? She started doing that when Dad died. She started putting tags on everything, telling who was going to get what. I call it the museum of the soon to be dead. (LAUGHING) You've got to be kidding. You'll thank me when the time comes and there'll be no tough decisions to make. Whenever I give her a Christmas present, I wonder if I should tag it twice. Who's Charlotte? A second cousin once removed. Beautiful decanter. Damn. There you go, Daryl. Happy Thanksgiving. So, who's Mikey? Who? The notches? Oh. Um... Michael. He's my son. Where's he at? I don't know. (DOG BARKING) Michael, I can... I can wait in the car. Good afternoon, Mr. Otto. What? I just don't see any point in rocking the boat. You're such a coward. Otto! I have guests! Oh, I'm going to take my hedge clipper to that little overactive piece of vegetation if you don't shut him up! Happy Thanksgiving, Sylvia! (SIGHS) Oh. Mikey! Mamaw. Oh! I thought you'd dropped off the planet. Oh, never mind. You're just in time, there's plenty of turkey. Oh, it's so good to see you. I see you've brought a stray. We should have called. Oh, I always take in strays for the holidays, you know, there but for the grace of God. Michael. Hey, Mom. Mamaw didn't tell me you were coming. Yeah, well, it was impulse. Hi, Mrs. Ainsworth. Name's McClain. She uses her maiden name, isn't that retro? I'm sorry. Mother, this is Bruce. Bruce, Mother. Hello, Mother McClain. It's nice to finally meet you, Bruce. Make room, make room. Well... All rise, the Honorable Judge Kathryn McClain presiding. (DOOR SLAMS) (WHISPERING) Marion, I'm going to kill you. You may be seated. Case on call, Estate vs. Daryl Cook. Prosecution, are you ready? Yes, Your Honor. Defense, you ready? Yes, but I have a motion. What's the motion? Move to dismiss. Grounds? My client is a juvenile and it's a direct violation of his constitutional rights to be tried in an adult court where his identity is known to the public. Council, I think you know that as a juvenile, your client has no such constitutional rights. I suggest you move on to something more relevant. With all due respect, Your Honor, I really shouldn't need an opening argument for a case that shouldn't be in this court. Nevertheless, I suggest you find one because in two seconds, the prosecution will have the floor. Your Honor, may I approach the bench? No. Your Honor, I... (GAVEL THUDS) This court is adjourned for 15 minutes. Council, in my chambers, please. You should stay in juvenile court, Tom, you have so much in common with your clients. Oh, really? I see what you mean. Patronized, marginalized, ignored by the system. Have I left anything out? Look, why would you bring this hopeless case into my court? I thought it was Marion's. It was scheduled... Get continuance, massage your calendar. Unless, of course, you wanted to argue in front of me. I don't know. Maybe try to take advantage of some personal relationship which, by the way, hasn't existed in over a decade. That would be... I don't suppose it would cross your mind that I wanted to be here because I respect you as a judge. I don't think that... What is it about this kid that has you so worked up? Somebody's got to cover the fringes. Not all of us can be at the center of the universe. It's already too damn crowded. Your Honor! BOTH: What? The people would understand a continuance if you'd like to recuse yourself. I mean... Is there a bathroom? Kathryn... (DOOR OPENS) This kids has had a nightmare life. Sell the jury on the merits, but leave out the constitutional acrobatics. All right. I keep forgetting how damn inconvenient you find the constitution. Oh, God, this is so typical. Yeah, well, this is so typical of you. (KNOCKING) Uh, Your Honor? Come in. Listen, catch Judge McClain before she leaves and give that to her. Hey, everybody. Hey. Hey. Well, Marion, I hope your weekend was worth it because you are dead. Haven't you guys ever run into each other before? It's not that big a town. You must still have some friends in common. Are you kidding? Divorce is like cell division. First the nucleus splits and then all those chromosomes thingies swim off to one side or the other. It's science. (ALL LAUGHING) Excuse me, I was asked to give this to you. I bet it's from Daniel Klein. Poor boy has no idea what he's getting himself into. You're just jealous because I made the list for court of appeal. Don't try and change the subject. Since when was Tom a subject? I thought I was talking about Daniel. Come on, open it. Get a life, you guys. Why? We've got yours. Oh! Oh, hello! If you don't sleep with him, honey, you could certainly sleep with this. Give me that, you slut. Speaking of which, Morris is very lonely. Morris is a troll. (ALL LAUGHING) So, uh, the cabin. Oh, don't. (ALL LAUGHING) You know, it's not that I was nervous about it, I just couldn't figure out how we'd get past the work situation. Because no matter how we feel, you still have to put that robe on every day. It's the robe, isn't it? I knew it was the robe. Do you keep one here? Please tell me you're not kinky because I've got so far to go before I get to kinky. Can I kiss you? Mmm. Sure. (GASPS) What? What? Sorry. I'm sorry. That's okay. I hope you didn't think I was being too forward. No, I didn't think, no, not at all. Because I don't want you to think I'm just... No, I don't think that. I could help you clean up the kitchen. I... Do you want me to clean up the kitchen? No, the... Actually that, I, that was ordered in. Really? Oh. Yes. I should go. It's okay, you don't have to go. I know. I just, I think we should try this tomorrow. We could try it tomorrow. Yeah. Is it too soon? No, no, no. Okay. Call me? Yeah. (GRUNTS) So, Irish, just which part of my total remission wasn't total? Kathryn, cancer is a vicious disease, and it doesn't usually play fair. Oh, not fair. Well, my my. I guess it's time for the gloves to come off, hmm? So... What do we do now? We start again? Listen, another round of the same sequence will do absolutely no good. What then? There's a research hospital in Houston. Cutting edge young Turks with all the new drugs. Big clinical tests with promising results, all that. Tests? Doesn't that mean I could get a placebo? Do you know these doctors? Yes. They're every bit as good as they think they are. Hmm. Sounds like a nightmare. Nothing you can't handle. It's Daniel, isn't it? (CHUCKLES) How did he get to be so serious? Oh, come on, why do you have to be so secretive. Can't you at least tell me where you're going? Cruise? Mountains? Both. Daryl Cook, he's 16. The facts were tried, the sentencing guidelines are as clear as a bell. No, they're not, they're rigid. And the boy has a good lawyer, he'll appeal. Anything special you want me to say to Tom when I deliver this? Well, you'll think of something. So my mother calls me, says can you feed the cats for five days. I cancel my cases, go to Texas and she waits till I'm knee deep in choice cuts and cheese bits to mention that there's a little cancer thing... What? ...she needs to take care of. How did that get in there? They hate that stuff. What am I supposed to say to that, huh? Oh, cancer. Wet food or dry food? Michael, can you make sure you change the litter because I don't care what they say, if you scoop, the whole place is going to smell like a barn by the time I get back. I'm just curious, Mom. If the chemo had worked and you didn't need a cat-sitter, would you have even mentioned it to me? There was no need to worry anybody. Are my vitamins there? Please. What else do I live for? Mamaw, it's her career. Michael, I know it's a lot to ask, but do you think you could come by twice a day because Archibald gets bloated if he eats too much at once, and Mehitabel... You did tell her? My God. Don't I feel special. I know and Mamaw doesn't? What am I supposed to do with that? Feed the cats. Great. If you die, can I mention it to her? (LAUGHING) Michael. Come on, don't get so dramatic on me. Anyway, what would be so scary about going to heaven? Besides the fact that you don't believe in it? I am not going to die. Dr. Hurley, he's going to make sure that I don't get the placebo. Besides, disease is a state of mind and any mind can be changed. I just haven't found the right argument yet. Think I can get a retrial based on her hating your guts? Just the first step, Daryl. We have to work our way up the ladder. Marion, what happened, where's Kathryn? You don't want to know. Yes, I do want to know. Why wasn't she here for the verdict? Sarah, when is Judge McClain back in court? She's cleared her calendar for the rest of the week. (DOORBELL RINGS) Michael. (CAT MEOWS) It's good to see you. I need to talk to your mother. She's not home. When will she be back? I'm not her secretary. Michael. This is important. Do you mind if I wait? Did somebody say martinis? She's not going to be back for three days, you can wait by the pool. Look... There's a pool? Your mother is carrying half a pharmacy in her handbag. She has never missed a day in court and now all of a sudden she's cleared her calendar for a week. Please, I want to know what's going on. Don't let the cat out. I'm Tom. I'm Bruce, it's nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you, too. I, uh, understand she throws up a lot. Wonder if the Astros are gonna sign the pitcher from Cuba. What are the papers saying about it in Houston? I wouldn't know. I put my money on the Jets. Well, that's football and that's New York. Football, baseball. The shapes may be different but they're still just balls. Kathryn! What? Oh! Who's he, your florist? Oh, Tom, what are you doing here? I thought you might want some help. Who gave you that idea? Oh, I think his name was Bruce, as in Michael's Bruce. Go away, Tom. Kat, why didn't you tell me you were sick? Because it's none of your business. But it's his business? It's none of your business whose business it is. Don't you have a plane to catch? Mmm-hmm. To your funeral. Nobody knows, including you. I have a career to protect. Besides, it'll all be over soon. And the worst problem I should have is explaining a ridiculously short hairdo. Hey, sweetheart! Mmm! How was D.C.? Dismal without you. Daniel, have you met my hu... Have you met Tom Ainsworth? No, haven't had the pleasure, Tom. Thanks. Well, got to get our little traveler back home for a hot tub and a back rub. We'll see you later. WOMAN: (ON PA) Ladies and gentleman, we are overbooked. Flight 282 to Toronto... Wow. Was that for me? (CAT MEOWING) Oh, look at you. Oh, sweetie pie, ooh. Want a little milk? Wouldn't that be nice? Yes, a little drink of milk. That'll be good, won't it? Yeah, that'll... That'll taste good. Here we go. Mmm. Mother? (GASPS) You scared me. I scared you? Uh, Michael, uh... Michael asked me to feed them today. He couldn't have. He knew I was coming back today. Well, I couldn't possibly have known that since I didn't know you'd even left. What? Lord, you must have had an awful flight. Mother... You can't stay, we'll talk tomorrow. You've got this on backwards. Tomorrow, Mother. (WHISPERS) Kathryn. How could you in the middle of the afternoon? Haven't you got something to tag? I don't believe we've met. Goodbye, Mother. I'm sure she means well. (DOOR OPENS) (LAUGHING) You poor, sweet man. (DOOR CLOSES) That was so scary! (LAUGHING) Ladies and gentleman, there are no easy cases. And when you get right down to it, life itself is pretty complicated, isn't it? And another thing you need to remember, there's a difference between facts and the truth. You see, with the truth, it requires complex elements, such as context and intent. (RETCHING) We're here, therefore, not to simply ascertain the facts, but to judge the truth. (PANTING) (WATER FLOWING) What kind of flu makes you throw up like that? Must have been something you ate. Did you eat on the airplane? (SCOFFS) You know what I say about airline food. It's cafeteria food the cafeteria couldn't sell. If I was holding my breath, you'd probably just sit there until I turned blue and died. Let's try it and find out. (DOORBELL RINGS) Now you stay right there, I'll get it. (DOOR OPENS) DANIEL: Hi, I heard she was sick. SYLVIA: Hello. Yes. DANIEL: I have these flowers for her. SYLVIA: I can tell her you stopped by. If I could just see her for a minute. She has the flu. DANIEL: Oh, come now, I'm sure she'll want to see me. Katherine, honey, it's Mr. Klein. Hey, I heard you have the flu. Yes, she does and it's extremely contagious. I'll find a vase. So why don't you, uh, tell me where it hurts and I'll kiss it and make it feel better? She might be right, I could be contagious. There must be something I can do. Well, you could take my mother on a cruise around the world. (DOORBELL RINGS) SYLVIA: You can't go in there. Come back here right this minute. TOM: Oh, and I'm sure you got an engraved invitation, huh? (BOTH BICKERING) Katherine, I... Great. Tom, what are you doing here? I, uh, I need to talk to you. Tom, please. SYLVIA: I told him. Didn't I tell you she doesn't want any company right now? I'm not company. Kathryn, I'll just go. No, please, please don't. Well, I just brought these things for you, I'd like you to try them. Oh, you did and they're lovely. Thank you. Bye. Sylvia, don't you have something to tag. Don't you have an ambulance to chase? Doesn't anyone have anywhere else they have to be? I'll check on the flowers. Okay. Oh, brilliant. I talked to an herbalist in Chinatown. He wants to see you right away. I made an appointment for you tomorrow morning. What nonsense. She'll do nothing of the kind. She's fine. No, Sylvia, she's not fine. Three days in bed, she'll be back on her feet. Sylvia, she went to Houston for treatments. That's where they send you when they've run out of ideas. You don't go to Houston for the flu. Mehitable called, said there was some kind of convention. Well... We have a quorum. Happy day. What kind of treatments, Kathryn? Please tell me you have an ulcer. Tell me you have a bad back. What is it, Kathryn? Chemotherapy? Kat, I'm sorry, I... You told Tom? No, I didn't. Michael, did you know? (WHISPERING) How dare you. How dare you not tell me! Oh, God. This is going to kill me. This will kill me. Oh, no. No, you do not. You do not make my crisis your personal agony. Oh, God, did you hear that? She just acknowledged that I might have some feelings about this. No, Mother, I know that you have feelings. There isn't a mammal in the northern hemisphere that isn't personally acquainted with your feelings. Sylvia, why don't... Why don't you just give us a moment? Oh, my God, I'm so sick of both of you. The world's greatest experts on my life. Well, I have news for you and here it is. This is my disease, do you see? And I'm going to handle it the way I want to. If I want to puke my brains out between verdicts, I'm going to do that. If I want to beat drums and howl at the moon, you cannot stop me. This is my disease and I'm going to do it my way. Judge has ruled. That's right. Now, you are going to take your grandmother to the courthouse to pick up her car. I'll come back in the morning. No, Mother, you will not come back in the morning. Go, and please take Daniel with you. (DOOR OPENS) I didn't mean to do that. You always mean what you do. Go. (ENGINE STARTING) Why don't you give me a call after you take your grandmother home? No, you call me. I don't have your number. That could be a problem. Kathryn. I missed you at choir practice. Listen, I heard about your... If you want to talk... I'm perfectly fine, but thank you. I went through it with Sidney, he passed away last spring. Sometimes you just need a friend to sit and listen to you complain about how unfair life is. Well, I never thought it was anything else. (KNOCKING) (KNOCKING CONTINUES) I didn't even know you were wearing a wig. I know this isn't the place, but we need to talk. No, we don't. Kathryn. Marion. I want to help, what can I do? Do you really want to help? Of course. Then shut up about it. Go away. Nothing is happening, nothing out of the ordinary. It's a tiny blip on the radar screen that will soon be gone. Oh, this is so typical of you. Good. I want to be typical of me. (TIRES SCREECH) (HORN HONKING) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) (HORNS HONKING) MAN: Lady! WOMAN: Move your car! Katherine. What are you doing here? It's business, really. Oh. Well... Yeah, believe me, you are not going to miss it. Yeah. Take it to Tuddle Automotive on Habergham. Mmm-hmm, that's the one. I don't know. It just, it stopped. No, I know they don't, but this one did. I don't know what she did. She took a chainsaw to the drive frame, what do you think? It was a joke. Well, it wasn't meant to be funny. Actually, it was meant to make you feel stupid, but I realize now I didn't have to try so hard. Okay, thanks. Thanks. (KATHRYN LAUGHING) There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. I have some news. Hmm. I made the short list, court of appeals. Oh, that's great. I, uh, guess this calls for a celebration. I am excited, I really am. I'm sorry, Marion. You don't know how many times I almost told you. I was just upset because you did such a damn good job of fooling me. But, you know, it's all really completely up to you. Thanks. It's for you. (SIGHS) Congratulations. I really am proud of you. I really want that job, Marion, I know I'd be good at it. KATHRYN: No, it needs to be a transitional piece. The length my hair will be in about six months. BRUCE: Well, this one's very in. Not too in. Mmm-mmm, too Hillary. What about this one? Ah! It would look like I was wearing a football helmet in that. That could be an advantage, especially in your family. Oh, my God, Michael, look at this. This looks like Jamie. It is Jamie. This is the wig he wears in his show. Why don't you just keep the ones you got? They look like your real hair. Honey, they're not like my real hair now. Right. It's uh... Shorter. Did we put money in the meter? (DOOR OPENS) Isn't that Michael? I'll, uh, I'll catch up with you later. Okay. Bye. Michael. Your mother's car will be ready tomorrow, you need to take her down there. And mention my name. Tuddle gives me a break on the parts. You got a quarter? You need anything? Oh, I get it. Trying to be dad right now. Excuse me, I... I didn't recognize it. You know what? I am not the cause of every single problem in your life. No. No, you're right. You gave me everything a boy could expect from one weekend a month KATHRYN: All right? I'm all right. Put it over there. I'm going to let it go now. Okay, I got it. Got it? Uh-huh. Not too bad. What's wrong? (GASPS) Oh, my God! (LAUGHS) Oh, my God, look at me. (CHUCKLES) Oh, my God, (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry. It must be really weird. No, no, I... (MUMBLES INCOHERENTLY) You look great. Uh, where are those lights? Actually, you know... Actually, I think I'd rather not. Well, if you're tired, I can do it, you can just direct me. No, you've been a really big help, but I think you should probably go. That's okay, so I'll call you tomorrow, see you at work. I don't think so, no. Oh. Kathryn. I can do this if you let me. I want to be here for you. I thought about it a lot, and I never brought it up because... I know. This doesn't fit anymore. I'm sorry. (CAT MEOWS) Oh, Mother, you weren't supposed to open that. Why can't you wait until Christmas? You never have anything to open. You just sit there like a bump on the log while everybody else opens their presents. It's not any fun! I'll decide what's fun for me. Thank you very much. Here. Wait a minute. I gave you this. You can't give it back to me. (CHUCKLES) Swap with your cousin Charlotte, then. You know, I thought maybe if you wanted, you could, uh, invite that, um... Your afternoon gentleman? I thought maybe we could just keep it to family this year, Mother. You mean you and me and Michael? I was thinking we might ask Tom. (DOG BARKING) Over my dead body. Oh, the dog. Oh, that dog! It's what I really want, Mom. (BARKING CONTINUES) Well... (COUGHS) (DIALING) (TONE RINGING) You've reached Dr. Hurley's office. Our regular office hours... (PHONE BEEPS) (MUMBLES) (DIALING) (TONE RINGING) Hi, you reached Tom Ainsworth. Please leave a message at the beep. (PHONE BEEPS) It's me, Kat. Are you there? I'm really just calling to say merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Bye. (PHONE BEEPS) (PHONE RINGING) Tom! No, it's Marion. Are you okay? Are you expecting Tom? Yes, it's nothing. He's just badgering me about that case. Oh, okay. Um, listen, you gonna be there? Can I come over? Sure. I'll be right there. Okay. (KNOCKING) Are you allowed? What's wrong? Who said anything was wrong? Champagne is for celebrating. That stuff, if I remember correctly is for forgetting. You're off the short list. They found out about the cancer. Wish I could say I was surprised. It's gotta be against the law. Oh, what's the law got to do with anything? Would have been nice to be able to turn them down, but it doesn't really matter now. It wasn't gonna happen anyway. Oh, Kathryn, you're scaring me. I love you. Oh. I have to protect my time for other things. I can't keep trying to do it all. Do you understand me? I have to give up the bench. No! Yes. Well, what can I do? You're already doing it. I, uh, I heard about the court of appeals. I'm sorry. Me too. I thought you might want to have these. Whoa. Is this the same bag? Just hold on underneath. It hasn't disintegrated? No. You know you're gonna outlive them all, don't you? If they had a fraction of your courage, they would do the right thing and put you on that bench. What's the point? The point is you're going to fight this. (LAUGHS) That's a brilliant idea. We'll fight it, we'll take it to court! We'll make them give me my hair back, we'll sue my cancer cells for non-support. Tom, listen to me. My hair is gone, I have cancer in my body that won't go away. There's nothing you can do to change that. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything unless you have the answer. (CREAKING) Remember the day on the boat? Why, we did some crazy things back then. It was a beautiful day. I guess there's just no following an act like that. You are so beautiful. (CHOIR VOCALIZES) * Oh, holy night * The stars are brightly shining * It is the night of our dear Savior's birth * Long lay the world * In sin and error pining * Till He appeared * And the soul felt its worth * A thrill of hope * The weary world rejoices * For yonder breaks * A new and glorious morn * Fall on your knees * Oh, hear the angel voices * Oh, night divine * Oh, night when Christ was born * Oh, night divine * Oh, night * Oh, night divine Let me see. Oh, Michael, it's beautiful. Oh, it's beautiful. SYLVIA: Isn't that sweet? Merry Christmas. Thank you, darling, it's beautiful, really. Hey, Mamaw, I've got yours right here. Oh, Michael, honestly. (GASPS) For me? (DOORBELL RINGS) Whoo. I thought he had better sense. Mother, we talked about this. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Thought you might not make it. Merry Christmas, Sylvia. Well, come on in. Michael? Oh, there he is. I brought my own tags. I thought you were a vegetarian. And? Well, isn't there some kind of law against vegetarians smoking? Isn't there some kind of law against ex-fathers coming to Christmas? Yeah, it's probably right next to the one about gay partners at Thanksgiving. I know what you're trying to do. I'm not asking you to do it for me, Michael. If you want to work things out with Dad, that's your business. Okay, but you have no right to drag me into the middle of it. All I want you to do is try. Just take one little step in his direction. Why? What's it going to accomplish? You know, we've hated each other for our whole lives... That's not true. You don't hate him. And he has never hated you! He said so! I don't believe that. He said the thought of me made him sick to his stomach. What? No, Michael, he might have felt that way about something you did, but he could never feel that way about you. What's going on, Mom? What do you mean? I mean, what's going on? What's the rush? What happened with Houston? Houston was an experiment. When were you gonna tell me that? I know, I'm sorry. You wait until I'm in a room with Dad... I'm sorry. And then you dump that on me? I wish I could do this differently. Do what, Mom? What are you trying to do? Get it out in the open, the three of us. No. No, I am not going to be a part of that. Okay? He is trying to take advantage of you at the worst time in your life. He's trying to help. He's trying to clear his conscience. This has nothing to do with him. This isn't about him. Mom, you're not making any sense. Your dad and I... Your dad and I... I think we always believed in the same things, you know? I know we did, I know we did, but... We never could get there in the same way. It wore me out. I just did not have his stamina. When I left, and you came with me, he... He became the person that you hardly ever saw. So you started to resent him, that was only natural. But, Michael, I saw what was happening. I saw it and I took advantage of it. You were a little kid. You wanted a black and white picture and I gave you one. You see what I'm saying? No. No. All my life you've been telling me what a bastard he is, okay, you're not just gonna change your mind now. Michael. Leave me alone. Both of you! I never said he made me sick. I know that. How could he have thought that all these years? I don't know, you'll have to ask him. Oh, he won't talk to me about that, you know that. I'm sure you'll find a way. You just never let up, do you? This is so typical. Mmm. Yeah, this is so typical... Of you. Come on, let me buy you a drink. What are you talking about, it's Christmas. Oh, I know a place that's open. (SLOW MUSIC PLAYING) Oh. Where did you get this wine? Philippe Million. What? You hate that place. Never. I love that place, I've always loved that place. Tom, I tried to get you to take me there for years. No. No, no, no, no, no. I have no recollection of that, Your Honor. Actually... I can't remember a single thing right now. You know, maybe you're right. You never did know how to give up. And you obviously gonna get some place I'll never see. Don't be so dramatic. You haven't died yet. No, but it sure gives me leverage in the conversation. You don't really think I'm gonna let you win an argument just because you have the big C, do you? Tom, I didn't get cancer just so that I could finally win the argument. Are you sure? Mmm. (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING) You know when we're really at our best? When? When neither one of us is talking. What a thing for two lawyers to discover. To bad parenting. Hear, hear. To a bad marriage. Ooh, triple hear to that. To bad in-laws. Wait a minute, now you're talking about my mother. You didn't exactly get along with my mother either. I never met your mother. Use your imagination. Ooh. Hear, hear. How come you got the china? Stayed with the crystal. You got all the good stuff. You got Michael. You got the notches. You could stay. No, I couldn't. But thank you. You know, someday, it would be really good for Michael if he spent some time in this house. Oh, Daddy. I've been having the lousiest dreams. Hi, Kat. It's been a while. Hmm. Kat? (DOORBELL RINGS) Kat? My baby... Baby... (SOBS) She's asleep. She has two broken ribs. Apparently the bones just... (SIGHS) I don't know. It's either the drugs or the cancer. Where's Michael? Does he know? Well, he has to be told. Pull! MAN: David Vardy, you're next up. Your mother's in the hospital. Pull! I know you don't wanna have to see me, but she wants me there. When's she getting out? Michael... This is, uh, serious. We don't have to cross paths. We could work out a schedule. But if we're gonna do that, you're gonna have to talk to me. Pull. Not sure I know how. I want to talk to you about this, Michael. I really do. And I always have. Pull! (GUNSHOT) Sitting on the bed, that can't be good. My goodness. This is gonna be very hard for you, isn't it, Irish? (SIGHS) Listen. We're both big believers in the unvarnished truth, aren't we? The thing is, Kathryn, there isn't a thing we can do, except keep you as comfortable as possible. You can hold my hand, can't you? Yes. Yes, I can. Dr. Hurley needs another minute. Did you find Michael? Yeah. I'm just, uh... I'm not sure he's gonna come up with me. Well, she's gonna need a few things from home. Are you going to be here? Yeah. Sylvia... Maybe we could take shifts? When Frank died, I'd thought the world had come to an end. But somehow I managed to... ...pick up the pieces and go on. I don't know how to do this. I never expected to outlive my child. WOMAN: (ON PA) Pierce Margolin to volunteer services. Pierce Margolin to volunteer services. (PHONE RINGING) Hey, everybody! LANE: Hi! Mincey, clear the table. Double surprise. Oh, yeah! A little nectar of the gods. That a girl! Excuse me, is that legal? Do we care? Look, just because we're not in the courtroom... Lighten up, Mincey. You're always so serious. Don't even try. He was born in a button-down collar. (LAUGHING) Hoist 'em. She's our best friend in the world, and we're gonna do what we can do. And what we can do right now is get drunk. To Kathryn. To Kathryn. To Kathryn. To Kathryn. Who's going to drink her shot? I think we all should. Let's take turns. Me first. To the finest judge I've ever argued before. Hear, hear. Hear, hear. Here. (LAUGHING) You're in a shoe store and someone starts... No! Tell me that you're not going to be terrified... No! (ALL LAUGHING) I just want to say to you all thank you so much for being friends to my daughter. (CAT MEOWS) Why do I keep feeding you guys? You're big as a house. You're going on a diet. Less-active kitties. SYLVIA: Well... There you are. Hi, Mamaw. I just came to check on the kitties. (SIGHS) Well... You might as well take them on home with you. (CAT MEOWS) Michael... Life doesn't happen to us in the right order. I'm scared, too. But we must do what we're called upon to do. You're mother's going down that road, whether we go with her or not. The only thing we can do for her now, that will matter to her, is to be with her. Sunday, January 4th, 1998... Sunday, January 4th, 1998... Good morning, Mildred. Sunday, January 4th, 1998... Alzheimer's... This really will be better, Tom. I can put her roll-away in the room. There are no visiting hours. You can be here around the clock. WOMAN: (ON PA) Dr. Varren to 624, Dr. Varren to room 624, please. Is it spring? No. Soon. Take me to see the dogwoods. (PHONE RINGING) Hey, Mom. I went and got Archibald and Mehitabel. Two wuss cats if I ever saw one. And I saw Riley, my landlord. Her old calico kitty cat is queen of the dumpster. And Archibald and Mehitabel are scared to death of her. I'm just gonna sit here for a while, Mom. Okay? I'm just gonna sit here with you. Hmm. What, baby? What are you saying? Where am I going to sleep? (CHUCKLES) Where are you going to sleep? Right here, darling. They've got you a nice bed right here. Where am I going to sleep? (SOBS) You know... Back home. With Daddy? Yes, baby. We'll all sleep there. Dogwoods are already blooming. Really? I think we should take her. Well, we could check with Dr. Hurley. I mean now. I mean, what are they gonna do, arrest us? I'm sure there's some liability issue about it, it could be tricky. I don't know. The staff around here doesn't exactly seem like the A-Team. Could give a new spin to the term graveyard shift. Monday, February 12th, 1998. Monday, February 12th... So, do you have family? My children are grown. Grandchildren? Three. Really? I'm the only one. Grandchild, that is. I'm the only child, for that matter. My, isn't that the prettiest shade of lipstick you're wearing. What do you call that? Natural. Really? Where do you get that? I was born with it. Nice lips. Mildred. I had no idea. Monday, February 12th, 1998. Monday, February 12th, 1998. Kat... Will you marry me? It's okay. It's okay, Kat. It's really, really okay with me if you win this one. Oh... (SOBS) I love you, son. Let's take her home. Yeah. (ENGINE STARTING) Where you going? Expressway's the shortest. It's gonna be jammed. All right, we'll use the diamond lane. It's a three person lane. That's right. Ticket's like 400 hundred dollars. Mmm-hmm. One, two, three. Oh, that's sick. What if we get stopped? I'm promise you, they're not gonna check her pulse. KATHRYN: Oh, God, this is so typical. You know, Bruce's brother tried to put a hat and coat on his Great Dane once. TOM: See, now that is illegal.
