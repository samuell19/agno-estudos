(singing in Hawaiian) * Hawaiian ripple * And the summers * Reached out and paint the flowers * We love the colors * Straight from heaven * They are a joy to see * (singing in Hawaiian) from Maui * (singing in Hawaiian) from Oahu * (singing in Hawaiian) from Kawaii * (singing in Hawaiian) from Hawaii * Snow white gingers * And pikake * (unrecognizable) and jasmine too * Bright red hibiscus * Green kukui * We'll make kale for you * Hawaiian rainbow * After showers * Reach down and paint the flowers * We love the colors * Straight from heaven * They are a joy to see * (singing in Hawaiian) from Maui * (singing in Hawaiian) from Oahu * (singing in Hawaiian) from Kawaii * (singing in Hawaiian) from Hawaii * Snow white gingers * And pikake * (unrecognizable) and jasmine too * Bright red hibiscus * Green kukui * We'll make kale * For * You (cheering and applause) - And be careful. Got lots of color on the left-hand side. This nice stuff is liko, but it's over-picked, so be careful. But we needed it up on the top. Picking up color (unrecognizable) and don't pull out the roots. Can you reach that one? Without breaking the branch? Just the tip. Yeah, there you go. Okay. This part is what is called the liko, or the bud. This is an ohia lehua tree, and ohia lehua tree is a symbol of the goddess Laka, and the flowers and the ferns that are associated with the mountain are dedicated to the goddess, Laka, who is the goddess of the hula, and all of these things are placed on the altar, or okuahu, as it is called, in the process of studying the hula, the dance of the Hawaiian people. (singing in Hawaiian) There's a legend that talks about two lovers, and Pele, the goddess of the volcano, got angry because she was in love with the male, and he loved this beautiful, young woman, and so she turned him into the tree, and the lehua is the symbol of the woman, and the ohia is the symbol of the man, and every time you pick a lehua, it's supposed to pour, so I've already picked a lehua. We should expect some rain shortly. (singing in Hawaiian) - Our musical origins go back to our primal past, probably back to Indonesia and Southeast Asia, and beyond, from whence our kupuna arrived, thousands of years ago. In the pre-Cook period, our music was essentially that heard from the pahu, or the drum, from the uli uli, or the bamboo rattle, from, in short, our percussion instruments. Obviously, we did not have Western tonal systems, or harmonics, or things like that, so out of that primal musical heritage came the mele and the uli, that is the chants for which Hawaiians have been famous for. - The idea of chant was to make the word sounded, or make the word as a living communication, so that the word was extremely important, and many times the actual poetry was thought to have mana, or some kind of cosmological power, that was an important part of the communication. It was for that reason, probably, that the first kinds of Hawaiian music were single-line chants, that is, just melody, no harmony, so that you could hear the word very clearly. Even the hula, the dance, which we think is so very important today, in the past, was only supposed to be a way to further illustrate or enhance the idea of the word. - Those chants tell about the most important myths and legends of our past, and those legends or myths in turn tell about our view of the world, and our feelings towards the cosmos, towards our purpose on earth and in the universe, so it was through the mele and the uli that our forefathers were able not only to explain, but also to retain their knowledge and understanding of life on this planet. (singing in Hawaiian) (chanting in Hawaiian) (drums) And then came Captain Cook, and with Captain Cook came enormous change, not only in our social and political and economic life, but also in our philosophical or musical life as well. - The principal difference, I guess, was that the missionaries introduced harmony, that is singing in parts with chords, which the Hawaiians called himene, which comes from the English word, hymn. Besides the influence of the missionaries, however, there were also the influences coming from the whalers, who also used harmony and instruments like guitar, and even accordion to accompany themselves, so that as some people have said, the Hawaiians got from Western music the best and the worst, in terms of the kind of music that they were going to have. (singing in Hawaiian) - The chant that we did earlier was written for King Kamehameha I, and it reflects a blending of the society. You find that there's harmony in it, and there's a call and response type of chanting that was part of the influence of the foreigners and the missionaries. The text itself is very, very old. It comes from the time of Kamehameha, but the, it had been put to music, and it's been adapted to Western-style song, and so it's a blend of the two cultures, a blend of the old Hawaiian, and the introduction of the missionary hymnal type three-part harmony. - The idea of himene soon became applied not just to church hymns, but to general parts singing, so that you could have secular songs about things like a beautiful waterfall, or a home, a particular home, that was also known as a himene. This kind of music was usually accompanied by guitar, and ukulele, so that you had both a harmonic accompaniment, and, also a rhythmic accompaniment coming from the same instrument. - We had thought of the ukulele as a Hawaiian instrument, but the fact of the matter is that it was imported by the first Portuguese immigrants to Hawaii, who landed here in the 1870s, and the ukulele became popular, because it was a small, convenient instrument that was easy to learn, and the Portuguese were pretty good at it, and they were also good musicians. One of the Hawaiians who took a real liking to the ukulele happened to be the king, King Kalakawa, who liked it so much that he hired Portuguese ukulele makers to make these ukuleles, and also allowed them to use his royal insignia as a trademark where the first ukuleles that were manufactured. Hawaiians became so adept at playing it that I think they soon acquired the ukulele and made it part of the Hawaiian musical heritage. - Now, here's a song, a Hawaiian song, that was first Hawaiian song that made a national hit in the USA, written by William Kailimai, who played at the San Francisco World's Fair, played it in the mainland for the first time, in 1916. Some of you may remember your grandparents singing this. (ukulele) (singing in Hawaiian) * Sweet brown maiden said to me * As she gave me language lessons * On the beach at Waikiki (singing in Hawaiian) * She repeated playfully * Oh, those lips were so inviting * On the beach at Waikiki (singing in Hawaiian) * You have learned it perfectly * Don't forget what I have taught you * On the beach * At Waikiki - The term ukulele has a rather picturesque origin. They said that it was called ukulele because it reminded them of the uku, that is a flea, because the way in which the performer used his fingers was looking like a flea jumping around on the instrument. - There's another song that was written way back in 1875, but is very much appreciated by the musicians who play music in the Hawaii today. It's called (speaking Hawaiian) by Mekia Kealakai, written in 1875. (singing in Hawaiian) - Hawaiians have also contributed a style of guitar-playing called slack-key, or kihoalu. Slack-key is a style of playing the guitar which uses various kinds of keys. The keys are slacked, and the resulting style with the type of rhythm, and with the type of songs that are played, is now known as slack-key, but how that came about is not very clear, but it most likely developed when the vaqueros, or the Spanish cowboys, came to Hawaii, and brought with them their guitars, and in time, the vaqueros not only taught their Hawaiian counterparts how to ride and lasso cattle, but also how to play the guitar, must have taught them that and from there, Hawaiians adapted the steel guitar, that is the slack-key guitar method. - Raymond Kane is the recipient of the National Folk Heritage Award. We're awfully proud of that fact, because only 11 people in the United States win this award. (cheering and applause) It's comparable to that of the Congressional Medal of Honor, so, without further ado, one of our own sons of Hawaii, master of the kihoalu, ladies and gentlemen, Raymond Kane! (cheering and applause) (speaking Hawaiian) - Represent each and every one of you, not only for myself, but for Hawaii, the state of Hawaii, for each and every individual here. Remember, I go and represent you all. Aloha. Now, at this time, we got these hula girls coming up here, and I'm gonna sing a song in slack-key, and the song is (unrecognizable) Every time I hear this song, it reminds me of Gabby Pahinui, who was one of the greatest slack-key players, and believe me, when I sing this song, it reminded me of Gabby Pahinui, and, well, he was my good friend. What can I say? He should speak for itself, and I go to Washington thinking of him, too, as well. He was the greatest of them all, Gabby Pahinui. (applause) (guitar) (singing in Hawaiian) (guitar) (cheering and applause) Well, slack-key started about 150 years ago, and, Vancouver came from England, he brought some cattles over here, and he gave it to King Kamehameha I, so Kamehameha, so, he told King Kamehameha to put a taboo on the cattles, that it grow, you see, so there be more cattles in the future, so when he died, the taboo wasn't lift, so until King Kamehameha III took over, and the cattle began to ruin the crops, and the land, and going into (unrecognizable) patches, so the people started to sort of grumble, you know? And making a big fuss about these cattles, and it was getting dangerous, and the children, they were invading in their land, and their yards, where the children played, so it would be pretty dangerous, you know, for the cattle to be there, so King Kamehameha III, he went to the mainland, so maybe he could find some, you know, try to see if there's anybody that could handle the cattles, so he went up there and he went to a rodeo show, and during that time, there was a lot of Mexican boys, and vaqueros, and Spanish cowboys, mixed with Spanish, so he was very impressed with how they were handling the cattles, you know, and roping the cattles, and stuff like that, you know, and whatever, so he hired all those people, you know? Asked them to sign a contract, to come over here, and see if they can round up the cattles over here, so they all came over here, and they all round up the cattles and everything. During that time, they brought their guitars over, and after their work, you know, they sit down by campfire, and they start playing some music, you know, and they were teaching the Hawaiians how to do cowboy work, so they were doing fine, so all of a sudden, the Hawaiians were very impressed with that guitar. It's the first time they seen it, so they usually had two guitars, you know, and one play, and the other one come together, see, helping the melody while the one just picking on one guitar, and the other guitar is strumming along with the melody, so, and the Hawaiians were, they really enjoyed the type of songs, and music, was very pretty, so, then the time came when they had to go back to the mainland, so some stayed, and some left. Some, they met some good Hawaiian fellows, and were in good people, so they gave the guitars to the Hawaiians, so all they had was just one or two guitars, but, you see, they were on different islands, when they received these guitars, and like I said, the cattle, they running wild, on every island, almost, so this Hawaiian guy, he sort of played this slack-key guitar. That's when the slack-key guitar started to be popular, you know, started be created into the guitar, so they had their songs, so, they started like this, they tune it down, from the standard tuning now. This is the standard tuning, and so the Spanish used this tuning. Okay, now, the Hawaiians, they really enjoyed that, they liked that, the sound, it was beautiful, so he couldn't do that, so, he tune his guitar down the way he think is suit for himself. The Hawaiian songs were a little different. So, they started off like this, with the melody only. (singing in Hawaiian) (guitar) (humming) But, you see, there was nothing there, so one day this guy started messing around with the bass, hey, and he started going all the way down to the last string. Hey, they got something, here, so they put it together, see? (singing in Hawaiian) (guitar) (humming) See, the bass added to the melody, makes it complete, and with the voice go along with it, it's just, that's what slack-key is all about. By having a bass and the melody together, in one, instead of separate, that's what make slack-key guitar. This is how (unrecognizable) used to play. (unrecognizable) my grandfather. Old, you know, but he remembered his old friend, he used to play this song, way back when he was a cowboy. (guitar) (applause) (applause) Is that wonderful? Just two strings, up and down. - The idea of slack-key is to get a very melodious sound, and a rather intimate sound, so that slack-key is not as good a music for large, outdoor concerts. It's much more what we call back porch music, sitting around with a primo, that is a kind of local Hawaiian beer in your hand, listening to this music, and sort of just relaxing. (guitar) (singing in Hawaiian) With part singing in Hawaii, that is, this himene style, it became customary for the groups to be all male or all female. We're not sure whether this was the influence of the missionaries, or just the way Hawaiians liked to do things, but it resulted in the unique singing style being developed. That is, in order for, for example, an all-male group to sing the soprano and alto parts, they had to sing very high in falsetto, which became known in Hawaiian as leo kiekie. This style of male falsetto singing used a lot of breaks, or sort of cracks in the voice, because a lot of times, men can't hold that falsetto that long. There is a kind of a natural break in the voice, but this was then incorporated as part of the style. Well, the women also got interested in singing in this rather unique fashion, so that now we have female singers also singing falsetto style, and it's a rather curious situation, where you have women copying men singing like women. - Another peculiar feature of Hawaiian vocal styles is yodeling, which was probably introduced into the islands in the 1890s by a music teacher who taught at the Kamehameha schools, named Theodore Richards, who learned it as a member of his college chorus, but yodeling took in Hawaii, because of the popularity of paniolo songs, that is, cowboy songs, and yodeling may have also been close to the kinds of music or songs that the vaqueros, the Spanish cowboys, may have sung on the big island in Waimea, or the Parker Ranch, when they first came in the 1830s. (cheering and applause) (singing in Hawaiian) (yodeling) (cheering and applause) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the (unrecognizable) brothers! - Tin Pan Alley was a great period in the development of Hawaiian music, because through Tin Pan Alley, Hawaiian music exerted a profound influence on at least American perception of Hawaiian music. Tin Pan Alley music was what American composers thought Hawaiian music was all about, and Wiki Waki Woo, for example, was just the way they thought Hawaiians did it, and Hawaiian music was popularized as a result of that by 1920, 1925, Hawaiian music records sold more than any other kind of record in the United States record market, believe it or not. - Even later, when the cruise ships brought large numbers of tourists by ship, the old Lurline cruise ships, to Hawaii, there also developed a tradition of singing that used a combination of English and Hawaiian text, referred to now as hapa haole, which means half white, or half foreign singing. Now, these kinds of songs were very accessible to tourists who didn't really understand Hawaiian language, so even though the language had changed to at least half English, it was still accomplishing the same important idea of communication. - This lady, a very dynamic personality in her own right, is a top musician, singer, entertainer. Would you put your hands together and welcome Auntie Violet Pahu. (applause) (singing in Hawaiian) (guitar) - [Announcer] Auntie Violet Pahu. - An interesting juncture at this point is the invention of the steel guitar, or the acoustic guitar, which happened in about the 1880s, when a young lad from a town called Laie attending the Kamehameha schools, the schools set aside by Princess Bernice Pauahi, for the education of Hawaiian children, accidentally hit upon the idea of using a bar and running it over guitar strings, and out of that, eventually evolved the steel guitar, as we know it. - This vocal-like sound of sliding, which was developed here in Hawaii, was "exported" to the mainland, and was very popular, became very popular, with country western groups. Of course, it underwent its own developments among country western musicians, because we don't really have the pedal steel here. That was developed on the mainland, and then re-imported back to Hawaii, so that you have a lot of common links, now, between country western steel playing, and Hawaiian steel playing, and many of the performers, like Billy Hew Len, for example, can go back and forth, can play Hawaiian steel Hawaiian style, and Hawaiian steel country western style. Whatever the market desires. - On the steel guitar, undoubtedly, the best that Hawaii has right now, Billy Hew Len. (steel guitar) (cheering and applause) - [Announcer] Thank you so much, Billy. - By the 1940s, Hawaiian music was well-established in the United States. Indeed, it was well-established around the world, because internationally, Hawaiian music was probably one of the most important ethnic musics around the world. Indeed, there were Japanese, German, Dutch, English, French, and Indonesian Hawaiian music bands, who not only performed in their national circuits, nightclub circuits, but who also produced and sold Hawaiian music records. Hawaiian music took decline after the Second World War, and has not been able to recover its status ever since. (speaking Hawaiian) - Aloha. - [Announcer] Boy, it's nice to have you, to talk to us about a subject that is not easy to define, but what, in your impression, is Hawaiian music? Let's start with that very general statement. - Well, first of all, Hawaiian music is beautiful sounds, and if you understand the words of a song, that people have sung for many years, you understand the meaning of the words, you can sing it with that inner feeling, and it just comes out, just flows out so beautiful. - You say that the beautiful sounds of Hawaii stem from this art form that you call Hawaiian music. Now, a lot of people have said that this particular art form is going out the window. It's like going the way of the dinosaur, becoming extinct. What do you think about that when people say that? - Well, when they say that, all I can say to them is that as long as I'm alive, Hawaiian music will still be alive. - [Announcer] That's wonderful. (ukulele) (singing in Hawaiian) (yodeling) (cheering and applause) - [Announcer] The good lord take good care of all of you, and keep you safe. (shouting) - Hawaiian music came precariously close to dying out, or so we thought, in the early 1970s, when we could count on our fingers, the number of steel guitar players, when we could listen to only one radio station that played Hawaiian music of any kind, when it was very difficult to find Hawaiian music being played in Waikiki, in other places, so a few of us organized the Hawaiian Music Foundation, in a deliberate attempt to revive the music, and this was, I think, a fascinating experiment in deliberately reviving a culture, because out of our efforts came the Hawaiian Renaissance in large part. - Young Hawaiians were becoming more aware of their heritage, trying to go back to discover their language, and their customs, and also became quite activist, in trying to regain their Hawaiian lands, so that it was not just an artistic movement, but it was also a very important social and political movement as well. - In the late '60s and early '70s, when I graduated from high school, and started playing music, I was looking for things to play music that interested me, and those things took me away from the islands, and traveled, and it was upon returning back home, in early 1971, that I touched upon what, for me, was a very good realization, and that was I could sing music, but in order to sing music from the heart, it had to deal with the environment that I was living in. - Hawaiian music has always been a part of my life, growing up here in Hawaii, and actually attending school, and really never living away from Hawaii. The family started the Hawaiian music appreciation, and it continues through my life today, and I think I'm part of a generation, a fortunate generation that has had the opportunity to learn the music, enjoy the music of those that have gone before, (speaking Hawaiian) and perpetuate what they have started. The music, for us, our group, Olu Mana, and myself, has given us an opportunity to meet and delve back into those things which are Hawaiian, which those things that are fundamental to life in Hawaii, and that is the protection of the land, and the natural things that are so much a part of Hawaiian culture. For us, that is, trying to keep it alive, by bringing thoughts of it into the music. - And I think, whatever we can do as musicians and performers and composers to bring to those that are not living in Hawaii, the spirit and Aloha of Hawaii, then that is our mission, and that's what we enjoy doing, (speaking Hawaiian) (guitar) * It's there, in the air * Can you feel it * Hawaii * Is calling (guitar) * Come to me gently * Rest here beside me for a while * It's there, in the air * Can you feel it * Hawaii * Is calling * Come to me gently * The wind * Spurs in the trees * It's there * In the clouds of the sunlight * Hawaii is calling * Come to me gently * Come inside of me * Come to me gently * Hawaii is calling * Come to me gently * Come inside of me * Come to me gently * Hawaii is calling * Aloha (singing in Hawaiian) * Remember, be sure, and be there * Remember, be sure, and be there * Hawaii is calling (speaking Hawaiian) - One of the earliest chants talks about the Polynesian migration, between the Hawaiian islands. It's called Ea Hawaii, and it tells of the Hawaiians, as they first sighted the islands of Hawaii, and it says, "Here is Hawaii, the island." (speaking Hawaiian) "I am a man. "I am the person that hath come "to settle on these islands." (singing in Hawaiian) "I am a child of (speaking Hawaiian) "I'm a child of my far-off ancestors "And I have come to settle these lands." (guitar) * Who came first to Hawaii * All of the kanakas * Now, who came first to Hawaii * All of us kanakas * And how come us kanakas * We no own the island * And how come us kanakas * We only like fight one another * We only want to pretend * And be like the greedy man * Don't want to give back * Don't want to share * Don't even want to try to understand * I said, now, * How can you sit back * While they're desecrating the land * And how can you sit back * While they're desecrating the ocean * And how can we fight back * We got to read, research, vote * And work the land * And how can they desecrate * And tell us that they still love this land * - This place is called Ka'ala. In Hawaiian it means "the way," "the path," and for many Hawaiians it represents so much about our past, but it also connects us to our future. Here, we grow (unrecognizable) which is the ancient and sacred plant. Here, we grow tea leaf, which is a medicinal plant. This place was a place of the first music, of the water feeding the loi, of the birds, of the people working. This whole place, the land, the aina. Aina means "that which feeds, "that which nourishes," but much more than just in a physical sense. It's a place that feeds your soul. It's the thing that keeps us living. It's the thing that is celebrated in music. I have a poem that I would like to share. It's called "choosing my name." When I was born, my mother gave me three names, Cristobel, Oshie, and Kuanani. Cristobel was my English name, my social security card name, my school name, the name I gave when teachers asked me for my real name. It was a safe name. Oshie was my home name, my everyday name, the name that reminded my father's family that I was Japanese, even though my nose, hips, and feet were wide, the name that made me acceptable to them that called my Hawaiian mother kuroi, "black." It was a saving name. Kuanani was my chosen name. It's my piko name, connecting me to the aina, and the kai, and the (unrecognizable) It's my blessing, my burden, my amulet, my spear. * Who came first to Hawaii * All of the kanakas * Now, who came first to Hawaii * All of us kanakas * Then how come us kanakas * We no own the aina * And how come us kanakas * We only like fight one another * We only want to pretend * And be like the greedy man * Don't want to give back * Don't want to share * Don't even want to try to work the land * I say, now how can you sit back * While they desecrating the land * And how can you sit back * While they desecrating the ocean * And how can we fight back * We got to read, research, vote * And understand * And how can they desecrate * And tell us that they still love this land * (guitar) - At present, the Hawaiian music scene is really quite complex. Because of the younger generation's interest in the past, you have the preservation of older styles, and older repertoire as one aspect of that rebirth or re-interest. You also have new pieces being composed in the old style, and, on top of that, you have pieces which are being composed and performed that partake of rock, and jazz, and even country western, that are really part of the mainstream idea of Hawaiian and American mainland music together. - [Voiceover] This land of Aloha. - [Voiceover] Our amazing feat, 21 years of Hawaiian music. - [Voiceover] We are KCCN Honolulu. - [Voiceover] Hawaiian radio. - It's about 12 minutes now to 3:00, KCCN's afternoon club. I'm Brick Wood, and it's Hawaiian radio at its finest. Special guest here today. A good buddy of mine. A fellow colleague, Hawaiian style, Israel Kamakawiwo'Ole Aloha, brother. Ho! You know what we want to talk about. Let's talk about the beautiful angelic voices of the Makaha Sons of Ni'Ihau. You guys got a style that is hard to duplicate, but here and again, I hear that style in church choirs a lot. - Through the years, we've grown musically, we've exploited the outer boundaries of Hawaiian music, meaning not only Hawaiian music, but, we'll say, what, contemporary, country, rock, reggae, calypso, Cajun, you know, you name it, and we utilize all of these into one certain, you know, structure. Like you said, church chorale, from the hut. This next song I'd like to do, ladies and gentlemen, is written by a very close of ours. Comes from the big island of Hawaii. Those of you that don't know where it at, that's over there. (laughing) That way. Song written by a brother, Miki Awani. Song he wrote during the time in our movement. Songs called Hawaii '78, and it goes like this. Here we go. (guitar) (humming) (cheering and applause) (singing in Hawaiian) * Just for a day, our king and queen * Would visit all these islands * And saw everything * How would they feel about the changes * Of our land * Could you just imagine * If they roll out * And saw highways on their sacred grounds * How would they feel about this modern city life * Tears would come from each other's eyes * As they start to realize * That our people are in great, great danger now * How * Would they feel * Would their smiles * Be content by their crying * Crying for the thoughts * Crying for the people * Cry for the land that was taken away * And then yet you'll find Hawaii * Could you just imagine if they came back * And saw traffic lights and railroad tracks * How would they feel about this modern city life * Tears would come from each other's eyes * As they start to realize * That our land is in great, great danger now * All the fighting that the king has done * To conquer all these islands, now there's condominiums * How would he feel if he saw (unrecognizable) * How * Would he feel * Would his smile be content * Cry for the crops * Cry for the people * Cry for the land that was taken away * And then yet you'll find * Hawaii (singing in Hawaiian) (cheering and applause) - One of the questions for young Hawaiian musicians is: Can you make a living doing this? And the question is a rather qualified yes, because financially, for example, the recording market in Hawaii is rather small, that the local recording industry is distributed only here in Hawaii, so many of these artists don't have any kind of mainland exposure at all, or the opportunity to sell lots and lots of records. The same thing happens with singers who are going to tour. They tour mostly around here in the state, and often, maybe to California, or to Washington, where there are large Hawaiian populations, but not much more than that. The idea of publishing music in Hawaii has not been a big industry here, so that yes, you can make it financially, but most of the very fine Hawaiian musicians all hold day jobs somewhere else. Another aspect of this is that often the Hawaiian musician is expected to share his music for free, and it is a little bit hard to tell your auntie, "No, I don't want to play for your baby luau "unless you pay me." That's not very Hawaiian, so a lot of the music is given away for free, and all those free sharings of music also mean that the Hawaiian musician doesn't get paid for his job, so that's one of the dilemmas for Hawaiian musicians. To be Hawaiian means to share, but to be a musician means you also have to make a living at it, so there are, how do you do this? One of the ways is to go work for another job, and then come back and play Hawaiian music at night. (cheering and applause) - Please help me welcome to Hula's the San Bernard Trio, with (unrecognizable) on bass, Sam Bernard on the ukulele, and Clyde Lono on the guitar. - Hello everybody, and we're going to feature our cousin, Sam Bernard, at this time. A song from his album entitled Kuhio Beach. It's a beautiful song that reminisce long, long ago, back in the days of the '30s and '40s. Picture, yourself, when there were no high rises in Waikiki, and see the beautiful torches, as they're lit one by one in the evening for the beautiful luaus that happen, as we reflect on the ocean. Our cousin at this time, and Kuhio Beach. (guitar) (yodeling) * Where the moon shines on the sand * And the beach boys * Surfing in with the tide * To the shore * With girls side by side * All the sun * You'll hear music * And the beach boys are now playing and singing * All day (singing in Hawaiian) * Singing in the moonlight * Under the palm trees * Down on the * Thinking and dreaming * Wining and dining (yodeling) * Where the moon shines on us * And the beach boys under the palm trees * Where music lingers on * Singing in the moonlight * Under the palm trees * Down on the sun tonight * Thinking and dreaming * Wining and dining (yodeling) * Where the moon shines on the sand * And the beach boys under the palm trees * Where music lingers on * Under the palm trees * Where music * Lingers * On (cheering and applause) - Mr. Sam Bernard, yeah! Beautiful song, Kuhio Beach. Mahalo, thank you. - Not enough people can hear the type of music that you saw today. It's a very special type of Hawaiian music that the tourist doesn't get to see when they come to Hawaii unless they come to Hula's, because, frankly, there's no place else to see this type or style of presentation. Any place else in Waikiki. There used to be a couple of places on the beach, but they're no longer there. Without this big, magnificent banyan tree that we have here, we probably wouldn't be doing it either, so we always say mahalo to the banyan tree, too. - Aloha, yeah, and here, we got our lovely young ladies, (unrecognizable) known as (unrecognizable) from Lehua Dance Company, and they share with you a song, Pua Mamane. (guitar) (yodeling) (cheering and applause) (singing in Hawaiian) The ladies of Lehua Dance Company. Thank you, ladies. Mahalo. - To try to define Hawaiian music is very difficult, because there are as many definitions, I suppose, as there are people. My own concept of what is Hawaiian music revolves, again, around the language. It should be in Hawaiian language, or mostly in Hawaiian language, and if it's going to be of the so-called himene type of music, it has to have, from my point of view, the feeling of Hawaii, which means love of the land, celebration of people. The text has to have some kind of an honoring quality about it, and the music, the sound of the music, itself, usually means a fairly rhythmical kind of music, that if not danced too, at least you can gesture to, or nod your head to, or maybe even tap on your beer bottle, if that's what you're up to. - Aloha Kawaii, a song written by (unrecognizable) And we feature the beautiful voice of Mr. Sam Bernard, Mr. Clyde Lono, and myself, as we share this special song with you.
