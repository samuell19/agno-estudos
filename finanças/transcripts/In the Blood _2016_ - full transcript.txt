JUNE Good morning, champ. Good morning. - What the fuck? - What? Who the hell drank my whisky? What the fuck? - Don't you have an exam today? - Yes. I have some schnapps in the freezer. It's a Yamazaki. My boss gave it to me. It's fucking expensive. - Good morning, guys. - Good morning. - Don't you have an exam today? - Yes, I'm on my way. The blood count indicates a microcytic hypochromic anemia. Moderate, as long as the Hgb is about 6. It's important to differentiate whether it's an iron deficiency or an AKS. - Hi, Mia. - Hi, Simon. - How did it go? - I got an A. - Great. - Is Knud up there? Yes. - Is that your stuff? - Yes. What's going on? Talk to Knud. He's up there. Hey, man. You don't take your stuff right away, do you? - What do you mean? - She just took all her stuff and left. You don't break up and take your stuff at the same time, do you? You break up and meet later to get your stuff. What did she say? Sorry. We don't have to talk about it. Fuck! - I'm sorry. - Oh, shut up. We're gonna have a great summer. - It's gonna be a crappy summer. - No. This one. Unscrew this. Hurry! This stuff knocks the shit out of you. Welcome. Nice to see you all. This is a six-week course with classes Monday, Wednesday and Friday. To this you can add residency at the Department of Infectious Diseases. We'll end with a written exam in August which you have to pass to be posted. It will primarily be on a river hospital on the Amazon in north Bolivia. That's us this fall. Questions? I don't know Six months on a boat in the jungle? It's a river hospital. We'll call at villages - - with Indian tribes no one's seen before, and they haven't see us. Crazy! - They have seen white people before. - No, never. And they have all these weird diseases we haven't seen here. You need to get out and feel yourself. Just get away from it all. Away from Copenhagen. Just you and your thoughts. We're gonna leave all the crap behind. Down there no one tells you anything, no one remembers anything. We're gone! We'll go away for six months. Fuck it all. And when we come back to the apartment, we're better human beings. Down there you won't have time to have a heartache. We'll go to Bolivia all winter and you'll forget all about Mia. We'll come back in April to the apartment and the guys - - and it'll be summer again. Don't be too needy. It's important not to text her right away. Let her come to you. I haven't texted her. I have to respect that she doesn't want to be with me. Knud, I think I have the solution to all this. You should go on Tinder. - Go on Tinder. It's full of babes. - How come you know about Tinder? I was on Tinder for a while, but then Katrine's friends found out. I have the perfect text to write to all the girls. - Listen. I'm doing a master class here. - "Hi, I'm Søren. I have a huge cock." Wimps write "hi, beautiful". No, write a question. Force them to answer. - Tired of being pussy-whipped? - I'm not pussy-whipped. - The hell you aren't! - No way! Come on, I've been on Tinder. I'm not saying she fucks around, but she's racy, isn't she? She's a flirt. - Women fuck around as much as men. - I don't fuck around. No, but some girl fucks another girl's boyfriend, and another guy fucks yours. - Sure, I guess that's the way it is. - It's an eco system going in circles. - So it's your turn to get laid now. - Precisely. - You're a mountain, Knud. - That's it. A mountain. Hold the rat by its tail. Who wants to try? No thanks. In it goes. It's starving. Come on ... I've got some food for you. Come on. Watch this. Come on ... Fucking awesome shit! - You're crazy. - Don't you want to feed it? Hell no! - How big animals can it eat? - A nice, fat rat. But out there they eat deer or even humans. A cow. Seriously, guys, you go on this river boat trip - - where you camp with tents and mosquito nets - - and in the middle of the night the Indians wake you up. "Get up," they whisper. You turn on your flashlight and in all the trees and on the ground - - there are snakes, bugs, spiders and lizards darting around. If you're lucky, you'll see little alligators. You don't want a napkin in your fancy shirt? No, I keep it in my lap. Only kids tuck it in their shirts. You fucking snob! You can catch piranhas from the boat. - They're in the river? - Sure, lots. They're not that dangerous. It's a myth. You can swim with them. - Don't they bite? - No. - Why does the name sound like "pirate"? - Because pirates ate them. You're gonna be the world's best biologist. - I'd fucking love to come. - You will. - Esben, can you get off work? - Actually, I've talked to my parents. They might lend me money for my own place. - Are you saying you're moving out? - I've just been looking into it. It's a great time to buy. - Are you sick of us? - No way. - Haven't co-op apartments gone up? - Yes. Our apartment's value has gone up by 300,000 kroner. That's 85,000 each. - Since when? - Since the last general meeting. - Which you didn't attend. - You're harsh. - For the third time running. - 85,000 could buy me a car. We were just talking about Bolivia, and now we wanna sell the apartment? - This is something we have together. - Hey, you're the ones leaving. Only for six months. - Six months go by like that! - I'd like to try living by myself. See what it's like to be alone. - Someone's coming. - Shut up, Esben. - Simon, hurry. - Pussies! - I can't open it. - Okay, let's drop it. - What the fuck? - Take the leash. - Is someone coming? - Let's go! - You can't bring the goat in. - You won't let in the goat? Come on. Just one beer. - The goat is looking that way. - The music's over here. No, over here. - We ought to post it on Facebook. - Guys, I found the party. - Any ladies? - Lots of ladies. My feet are killing me. - Because of your fancy leather shoes. - My classy shoes. Here he comes. Hey there! Hey there. Party! Let's get a drink. Get up, man! Check out all the babes. - I can't right now. - You need a drink. Not now, Simon. I'm beat, Simon. Let's get a drink. Hey, champ. Where are you? - Hey. - Hey. - Have you seen my friend go by? - Dunno. What does he look like? - He looks normal. - I don't think so. - He may have had a goat with him. - What? A goat. Okay. I don't think I've seen a normal guy with a goat. Maybe they went home. Wanna come? - What's wrong with this place? - It's a drag. Let's find the goat. Let's go. Maybe it went for at beer at Andy's. If I were the goat, I'd be on a plane outta here. If I were the goat, I'd be doing goat stuff - - like eating grass and hanging out with sheep. It's finally free. It's taken off to a far away place. - Not a very responsible goat. - Responsibility is overrated. - I don't think so. - No? Okay. - My ex felt the same way. - Oh, was that a compliment? - No. - I'm not looking for a relationship. - Me neither. - Okay. Relationships are overrated. My friend would agree. He just got dumped after three years. - How's he doing? - He feels like shit. Don't all relationships end like that? They turn to shit? I'm liable to agree. Good morning, Kirsten. Your X-ray results are back. You have pneumonia. - Phew! - So it wasn't malaria. - We'll put you on antibiotics. - Good. - Okay. Get well soon. - Thank you. - Good morning, Christian. How are you? - I'm better, thank you. - I brought some students along. - Fine. Let's take a look at Christian. He came back from vacation with a fever - - joint and muscle pains, and he has a rash. I'll lift your blanket. - Any guesses? You? - Dengue fever. Well spotted. What to do? Painkillers and observation. And blood tests to establish antibodies. You should ask him where he's been, and what else should we remember? If there's a risk of his condition worsening. No, incorrect. Dengue Shock Syndrom. Blood in the spit and stool, abdominal pain, blueness around the mouth. Thank you, Christian. We'll look in on you later. I was extremely tired. Stomach pains and I've vomited. It felt like the flu, but then I got bruises on my legs that won't go away. My doctor said my eyes were yellow, and so was my skin. So I was admitted. How old are you? I'm 23. - Will you be there during my surgery? - Yes. - What happened to you yesterday? - I went home early. I was beat. - Where did you sleep? - I ended up on the west side. It's all a blur. Who was she? Was she nice? Yeah. We went to a bar. You're gonna see her again, aren't you? Maybe. No, I dunno. - Cut the crap and give it a shot. - Shut up. I'll sort it out. I drunk-dialled Mia last night. - What did she say? - She didn't answer, thank God. So I left this long message. So pathetic. Fuck that. Shit happens. Did you hear from her? No. JULY - Go get us some coffee. - I think we're out. Go check then. - You do it. - No, you do it. - I'm not going to the store. - You have to. I've gotten - - a whole lot of offers for the apartment. - We got a 2.6 million bid. - 2.6? It's a tentative offer, but still. But it's for the whole apartment, not just my share. - But that's still good. - It's great. But they want to buy the whole place, so you and the guys have to agree. - Email it to me. - I'll forward it. Oh, my cock! - Run, Søren! - Hurry, guys! What's going on? The party's over! Knud! - Let go! - What are you doing? What are you doing, Simon? Let's go! - Shit, man. You punched him. - I had to get away from him. - You don't go around punching people. - I was just trying to help you. - Chill! He's okay. - Sure? Sure, he's okay. - Fuck, I was scared. - That was close. Check out all the babes. Hey, girls. Want some surgical spirit? - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? - I want a drink. - Sorry, but we're closed. So come with me. I've got this. - What the hell is that? - Surgical spirit. - You can't be serious! - What? Mezcal. Wanna dance? Ouch! What happened there? Nothing. - Ouch! - What is it? Nothing. Tell me. I got into a fight with a guard at Roskilde Festival. Me and my friends climbed the fence and the guard caught my friend Knud. I had to help him. Fucking stupid. Once at the bar this drunk guy knocked my shaker out of my hand. So I just grabbed a glass and hurled it at his face. - I didn't stop to think. - So what happened? He went home. Stupid. Who's August? - August is a calendar month. - Okay. The truth is that it doesn't matter. How many do we need? Well, tetanus, hepatitis A and B and typhoid fever. Hell, you know that. - You're such a wimp. - Shut the fuck up. - Shit. - He's ugly. - Fuck, he's ugly. - I can't handle this. Let's jump in. Too late. Let's go say hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. - This is Anders. - Hi. - Are you playing junkies? - Shots for Bolivia. - Bolivia? - Yeah. - We're going to stay six months. - In the jungle? - But you're afraid of spiders. - I'll just have to get over it. - Great. - Aren't you ... Yes, we're going swimming, so we'll get going. I'll see you around. Bye, Simon. Hey, Knud? - Wanna chuck the scooter into the sea? - Hell yeah. That would make my day. They're about to dive in. Then we just push it in and take off. - Nobody's gonna see. - Are you serious? - They'll know it was us. - But they can't prove anything. There's only about a million witnesses. She's going swimming in our spot with that old limp dick. Maybe they're just friends. She was such a flirt when you were dating. She's free to do what she wants. - You deserve a whole lot better. - Butt out, okay? I don't need you to be my shrink. Just get it into your head. Bummer! - How about the scooter? - Forget it. - Sure? - Fucking sure. - Is this your first transplantation? - Yes. - Hey, what are you doing? - Sorry, I was just ... Do it again. From the top! Not just the two fingers. Thoroughly. And hurry. If you want to be ready in time. - Karen, are you ready? - Yes. I'm going to give you a painkiller first. Remember we talked about counting down from 10? Begin now and I'll give you a sedative. 10,9 - - 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... She's out. - The patient is ready. - Let's begin. Scissors, please. Let's get these vessels, too. Rinse. - We've put in a ligature over there. - Yes, we've put in a ligature. Now apply the vessel sealer to coagulate. Fuck, microsurgery is fucking wild! Sewing the blood vessels ... It's mindblowing. - Wanna go out tonight? - I need to study. - Just one beer. - Not tonight. - We could go over it together. - Not tonight. I need to be by myself. Okay. - Simon? - Hey. How are you? - Fine. How about you? - I'm fine. - What are you doing? - Not much. I'm just home. Okay. I'm in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by. - Now? I'm in the middle of dinner. - I can be there in two minutes. - Hey. I have guests. - Hi. - Is this a bad time? - No, come in and sit down. - You look drunk. - I do? - Yeah, wasted. - I'm not wasted. - I got the key. - Great. It's in that area. How about we bring a GPS? Not that old GPS again. Let's bring a map and a compass. - You'll need your scout's cap. - It's in the mountains. In the mountains? Come on! We agreed on a beach house. - We're gonna have Sangria. For sure. - No Sangria. For sure. - I'm having Sangria for breakfast. - I refuse to serve Sangria. It's the best drink ever. You can buy it at the store and add sugar. No way. - Are you going to Spain? - Yeah, we rented a house. I can't wait to chill by the pool. Hey, August? August, if you can tear yourself away, did you fix a decent stereo? - I demand better sound than last time. - I emailed this cool dude. Hey. Anything wrong? Have fun with August. KNUD Unanswered calls (5) Hey. KNUD: Hey, champ. We're in Berlin. Tried to call ... Back Sunday. SIMON: Seriously? I thought you had to study. Fuck! - Hi. - Hi, Karen. - Simon? - Well remembered. How are you doing? - Not so good. - No? - My body is rejecting my new liver. - I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe they'll find a new one. Yes. I'm sure they will. Bye. Hi! What's up, Gramps? Hi, Simon. I dozed off. Here you go. You should have come. We had the best trip ever. Well, you just took off. I called like 17 times, but you didn't pick up. It's cool. I've been busy. - Fuck, we had fun. - You did? You should have been there. What have you been up to? Hung out with that girl? What girl? No, I've just been working and studying. - We have exams in two weeks. - Sure. - We have a lot to cram. - I know, relax. Swot. The others are shopping for a barbecue. We're meeting in ten minutes. I'm a little beat. A little tired? And a little sad? Maybe you should just stay in. I'll tuck you in before I go. How about that? - Eine kleine Wurst. - How about a wurst? Vielen Dank. - Bring a beer. - Yes, please. Shut up with the German. Listen, we got an offer on the apartment. Okay. When? The day before yesterday. In Berlin. - Okay ... - A great offer. I'd like to move in with Katrine and take my last semester in Aarhus. - Sounds like you've all been over this. - We went over it in Berlin. We were talking when the email popped up. That's all there is to it. And I'm telling you now because we're all here. - Wanna watch the Tour de France later? - I love the Tour de France. He's breaking away! - I've got you! - No way. Fuck you. - Fuck you, Søren. - You smoke too many cigarettes. - Fuck you. - Fucking pussy! Fuck, man! What the fuck is wrong with you?! You fucking idiot! He yanked my handlebars. Psycho! My arm hurts! - I'm going to hold here. - Careful. I think it's broken, so let's find a cab. - Let me take a look. - Simon, get the fuck out of here! - You broke his arm. - I'm just trying to help. You can't help him when you've just broken his arm. Feel for yourself! Why must you always fuck things up? Why can't you just be a good guy? - Why must you always fuck things up? - I didn't mean to. - It was his own fault! - No fucking way! It was your fault! Cool down, Knud! Cool down, Simon! Cool down! - Fuck off! - Why must you always fuck things up? What the fuck is your problem? Stay away from him. I made coffee. Did you call Søren? I'll catch him later. They have to operate, you know. - Look, we raced. - That's no excuse. What's going on, Simon? - We have to talk about this. - I don't know, okay? Nothing's ... Something's wrong. Just tell me. What's wrong? I don't know. - Simon, talk to me. - No. I'm moving in with my parents. - You're moving out? - Yes. We're selling the apartment anyway, so who cares? -- Søren speaking. - Hi, Søren, it's Simon. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. How about you? - Well, my arm kinda hurts. - I'm really sorry about the crash. - I'm sorry I didn't call earlier. - Well, that's just the way you are. Look, the nurse is coming. Gotta go. Bye. Rejection Acute rejection is seen ... Name Karen Jensen Admitted after transplantation 7/29 2015: Patient passed away quietly Hi. I'll take a chicken-broccoli with extra chili. - Anything else? - No thanks. - Here you go. - Thanks. Simon? Hey. - What are you doing here? - Buying food. Oh, right. Was Spain fun? - I didn't go. - Oh, okay. So ... I'm sick of Copenhagen. Precisely. If you could go somewhere else, where would you go? I don't know. Not to Spain, anyway. How about you? I'm the guy who goes to Bolivia never to return. Right. You go to the same places and meet the same people - - with the same opinions and the same fuck buddies. - It's a hillbilly town. - I'm sick of the fucking hillbillies. - I'm going that way. - That way? It was nice to see you. Got any plans for the weekend? - This weekend? - Yes. - I'm working. - Okay. It's just that my parents have a house in Sweden with a lake and a forest - - and you can swim ... Nothing fancy, but if you need to get out of town? Think about it, okay? Well ... sure. I haven't been here in ages. We always used to go in the summer. - You and your parents? - Yeah. But then I kinda grew out of it. Are your parents still together? Yeah, whether they like it or not, you know? They've been together for ever. I've dated August since I was 17. But then he left me a while back. And there I was, with his name tattooed on my body. - Not so cool. - You still see each other? He always calls when he's drunk and then I can't say no. And then we're like friends, and that doesn't work. I dunno ... Nothing really lasts. It's just a bummer. I know the feeling. My friends are selling our apartment. - That really pisses me off. - So are you mad at them? Esben bought his own place, and Søren is moving to Aarhus. So he's there. Søren's birthday party is on Saturday - - and I don't know if I'm invited. Why wouldn't you be invited? Everything's just gone wrong. - And I had a fight with Knud. - Weren't you going to Bolivia with him? - Yes. - But ...? Sometimes I feel like grabbing him: "Hey, Knud! You're my best friend. And don't you ever fucking forget that." Simon, I'm sure your friends want you to come to the party. Wanna come? What kind of party is it? - A big party? - Pretty big. It's in a community garden - - so you can just blend in with the crowd. Okay. Is this size okay? It looks like a cucumber. I think peyote gives you a better kick than a cucumber. - When does it kick in? - I have no idea. Emilie? Emilie! Emilie! Simon. Simon ... are you okay? Shit. - It's fucking strong. - Yeah. - It's hot. - Yeah. - You're going away. - Yes. Yes. Turn to page 329. Today's subject is parasites. Chagas Disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It is commonly spread among children. Mortality rate 10% in the acute phase. The parasite is spread by assassin bugs, aka "kissing bugs". Seen here. They live in cracks in mud huts and straw huts. Ready for the exam? I'm behind. Don't you need to stop going out and study instead? I haven't really been going out. Is it Mia? We've had morning coffee a couple of times this past week. Morning coffee? That's great. Are you back together again? Maybe. I'm not quite sure. Hey, wanna come to the birthday? I'm going now. Or drop by later. Hi, Søren. Sorry I'm late. - Is that for me? - Yeah, congratulations. - Got it? - I'll just have to try. - How's your arm? - It's healing the way it should. - Hi, Katrine. - Hi, Simon. Glad you could come. - Look what Simon got me. - Exciting. - Need help? - Please. - It's big. It's hard with this arm. - And there's a lot of tape. Fucking awesome! It's a Mexican kingsnake. It's awesome! - Look. - It's moving. It's cute. - Isn't it cool? - It's ... cute. - It stuck out its tongue! - It's exchangeable. - Let's go say hi to Lisa and Frederik. - I'll be right over. We'll see ... Coming! - You bought that? - It's from 1988. It was renovated a few years ago. Undercoating and the works. Great picture. - Nice. - Simon, check this out. - Yours? - Yes. You're welcome to borrow it. How is medicine? It's a big responsibility. - It's really interesting, too. - I don't hear much about you anymore. - Not like when you were all together. - Those were the days. Yes, when you were at school. May I have your attention for a moment? We're not just gathered here to celebrate my beloved Søren's birthday. We also have a surprise we'd like to share with you. - She's pregnant. - Seriously? Søren told us in Berlin. We won't be alone anymore - - because we're having a baby. Congratulations! Congratulations! - Congratulations. - Thanks. - Congratulations. - Thanks a lot. - Congratulations. - Thanks. I'm going to be a grandma. Imagine that. And you're all going to be uncles. - Que hay en el bolso? - Sí, claro ... - What does that mean? - "What have you got in your bag?" I know one more. Hay una cerveza y un passaporto rojo. Something about a passport. You're very close. "I have a beer and a red passport." - Cecilie, wanna dance? - Okay. - I'm going to grab her, guys. - Fast mover, huh? El gringo. - We have to buy plane tickets. - For Bolivia? Yeah, where else? I think I'm going to ask Rune if we have to go for a full six months. Sure we do. - Anything else is too short. - But we'll miss out on midterms. And so what? We're gone all semester. - You're not pulling out on me, are you? - No. - Hell no. - Hey there. - Am I interrupting anything? - Not at all. What are you talking about? We're just hanging out. - Want a refill? - Yes, please. Thanks. Isn't it beautiful? - About Katrine, I mean. - It's shit ugly. What are you talking about? Being pregnant is beautiful. It's a new life. That's my point. So ... life isn't beautiful? That's not what I'm saying. A pregnant woman isn't fertile anymore and that makes her unattractive. It's a biological fact. You're so full of crap. You think I want to move to the country and have a bunch of kids. - I never said that. - But that's what you think. - Hey. - What? What I think doesn't matter. You're back together with Knud again. You're back together, and you're happy. Right? Nobody's happy, Simon. Even if you think everybody else but you is. - Okay. - Fine! - Simon? - Hey. Were you asleep? A little. I was chilling on the sofa and fell asleep. - Sorry if I woke you. - It's okay. Is it a fun party? Not really. It would be more fun if you came. -- Isn't it in the other end of town? - Sure, just around the corner. - I can't be bothered. - What if I spring for a cab? I'm just kicking back, you know? I'm in love with you. We agreed not to become involved. Why did you say that? I thought you were going to the jungle. Sure, but I'll be back again. Right now I don't even know if I'm going. Simon ... No matter where you are, you want to get the hell outta there. Responsibility is overrated. Isn't that the way you want to be? - I don't know. - No. Well, find out. See you, Simon. Simon ... Simon. Fuck. - Are you cold? - Where am I? You're right outside the house. Everyone else went to bed. - Fuck, it's cold. - You've been asleep for hours. Come on inside. Let's start. Forceps and scissors, please. Hold, hold, hold! There. Super. Pull down the cover. - Is it the girl from Roskilde Festival? - What do you mean? Come on, I met her when she snuck out of the apartment. Answer her. It didn't work out. - Sure you don't want the snake? - No can do. It's Katrine's place. New rules. Shit, Søren. I can't believe you're moving to fucking Aarhus. I know. Fucking Aarhus. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - It's far out. - It's great. Simon! Sit down. Sit down. Say hi to Sara and Louise. Tonight's girls. - How about a shot? - Have a beer. - Fill it up. - No thanks. - Drink up, Simon. - No ... - No, I can't. - It's good for you. Cheers! - Here. - Do I have to? Blue! Way to go, Simon! Take a blue one and put it on top, but don't knock it over. Don't knock it over! Well done! What's going on? It's over with Mia. - I thought you were okay. - It's the same old thing with her. We're okay, we're not okay. I've had it. Let's build the Tower of Babel all the way up to the ceiling. - When did this happen? - This morning. It doesn't matter. You're right, I'm a fucking mountain. I'm a fucking mountain. Aren't I? A fucking mountain! Down the fucking hatch. Drink the rest. Alright! I'm a fucking mountain! Simon ... Simon. Are you dreaming, Simon? Let's go. I need some action, Simon. Okay. - Hi. How many are you? - Two. Go on in. Have a good night. - What the fuck?! - Remember me, huh? - What the fuck are you doing? - Come on! - It's the Roskilde guard! - Fuck! I can't wait to get outta here. Me too. Have you talked to her since you saw her last? I deleted her number. The worst thing is, if she wanted me back tomorrow, I'd say yes. But she doesn't. I'm so fucking stupid. No. You're not stupid. Time's up. Put your name on top of page 1 and hand me your papers. Thanks. We'll correct them now, so you'll know if you passed or not. Your results will be posted on the wall outside in a couple of hours. I just need your papers. I thought it was tough. - You'll pass. - I sure as hell hope so. I think they've posted it. Yes, man! - Well done! - You too. - Let's go celebrate. - Fuck yes! Can I talk to the two of you for a minute? - Sure. - What's up? I think you know. Please open your bags. - What have we here? - Surgical spirit. Please open yours, too. - It's empty. I took it. - You aren't involved? - He's got nothing to do with it. - I didn't ask you. Simon, please come with us. I'll wait out front, Simon. Do you admit you've stolen from the department? - Yes. - Alright, thanks. - So, what happens now? - We'll report it to the dean. Disciplinary proceedings will be instigated. What about Bolivia? Don't count on it. I made coffee, Simon. It's surgical spirit, for fuck's sake. We'll talk to them after the dust settles. We're going away together. I'm sure Rune will talk some sense into them. Or we'll go to Asia. They have river hospitals as well. - We'll work something out. - Knud ... It'll be okay. The main thing is that we go together. Listen ... I'm not your friend. Simon ... We'll work it out. We'll find another cool place to go. - I'm not your friend, Knud. - Don't say that. Sure you are. I slept with Mia. At Søren's party. It just happened. And it shouldn't have. You had sex with Mia? - Why? - Because I'm fucked up, Knud. Why? Because I'm fucked up. I want you to go. - I'm sorry. - Go, Simon. I want you to go now, Simon. SALE OF CO-OP APARTMENT IN THE BLOOD Subtitles: Helle Schou Kristiansen Dansk Video Tekst
