What good to awaken from a nightmare when the nightmare turned out to be real, worse even than the nightmare that had tormented her sleep.

At least no solution which didn't threaten the creation of even greater danger, havoc and fear without limit or end. ♪♪ [operatic] VERA: Hi, Mom. Fine. I mean, yes, I'm okay. I'm... How are you?

Hold on. [buzzer] [ding] Hey. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. What's goin' on? Nothing. Nothing? No. Well, maybe that's the problem. Maybe you just need to go back to work. Yeah, you know, when something worthwhile comes along, I think I will. I think that's probably a good idea. Okay. Look, I also think that all the time and energy I had to put into doing my thesis, it broke the rhythm of what we were just starting to establish in our relationship, and I... I take blame. Uh-huh. Don't you agree? What? Do you agree? I'm sorry. With what you just said, I wasn't concentrating. Would you like to hear some of my thesis? I still have time to make some tweaks, and I would love to get your spontaneous response. Well, my spontaneous response would be the same now as it was when you first brought it up, which is that if you're, you know, if you're gonna write a thesis on murder between Dostoyevsky and Dickens, then why not expand it to include Shakespeare and Marlowe and Webster and Turner and Poe and... Whoa, what? Well, that would be my spontaneous response. But why would I have already finished my thesis on Dickens and Dostoyevsky and have to hand it in next week, would you be suggesting a complete renovation? Well, no, I suggested it when you first brought it up to me. - No, you didn't. - Well, maybe you misunderstood or maybe I didn't articulate myself clearly enough, but I did. What you said... Actually, what you asked me was, "Why Dostoyevsky and Dickens? Why not Dostoyevsky and Shakespeare, or Dostoyevsky and Marlowe?" I really don't wanna argue about it, Leon, because I'm sure that your thesis is great. Okay, it's just a little weird that you would be suggesting this now... It's really... It's just not a good time for me. It's just weird that you would be bringing this up right now, at the last possible moment. I really don't wanna argue about your thesis, Leon! I'm sure it's great, okay? But this is not a good time. For me and for us and for this. It's just not a good time right now. Time? Wait. This doesn't make any sense. What are you talking about?

It's Franklin. I'm on my way to the airport. Can I come up? Hold on. [buzzer] [ding] - Hi. - Hi, hi. Hope you don't mind my having come. No, I'm glad. I'm glad you came. You want some breakfast? So you're leaving now? I'm leaving now. I'll be, um, heading for the airport in 15, 20 minutes. I came because, to be honest, I was concerned about you. I detected in your voice... ...voices. You seemed kind of fractured, and I... You were... I just felt you didn't sound yourself, and I... Is everything okay? [sighs] I don't know. Um... No, I think if I was really honest, that I was... You know, I just, like, feel very, uh, uneasy. SAL: You know what that half-empty bottle says to me? There's a void in your soul. A big gaping hole. FRANKLIN: I don't mean this to be in any way offensive or even too aggressive, but I've always assumed that you and I have never hidden anything from each other. But now I'm wondering. Have you been leading a secret life? Sexually, I mean. Because I was thinking maybe you have a whole separate lurid existence on the side about which nobody, myself included, has had a clue. And I mean that as a compliment. I've never known anyone who can make everything believable and about whom anything that was said would be believable. I think that may be why you're so effective in each role you play. You seem to be capable of anything. What about work? Do you have anything in mind? No. I mean, I'm trying to write and struggling a little bit with what that is, And workwise, you know, I'm supposed to be reading scripts, and I just... but I can't really feel inspired for some reason. I'm, like, hitting walls, and maybe that's part of it, that I haven't worked for a long time. You know what? I should write something for you, which we could do together. I guess, if there was something that was really exciting, then I would probably feel inspired, but... I haven't found that in... I think it's more just like a lack of focus or something. For some reason, everything is just, like... like I can't sort of sit still or be with something or... You mentioned writing. What are you writing? Right now, it's just a... It's like a little jumbled, you know, collection of... Yeah, like a stream of consciousness, I guess. And sometimes it feels great, and sometimes it makes sense, and then other times, it's just like a mess, and, you know, it's... I feel like if there was a sense of, like, peace and balance, then I would be able to have a perspective on it that I can't seem to find. I'm just restless, you know? Are you writing in the first person or the third? Third right now. Fiction or nonfiction? I'm not sure. Sometimes it's hard to know where one ends and the other begins. You know about madness. You got your demons, too. I'm curious because when I write, I always feel I'm a medium and that I am, um... The voices are invading my brain, and I'm trying to shut a couple of them out and let one voice speak... Solid gold. ...because otherwise, I have three or four voices in my head all the time, which is why I'm this step away from snapping. We shared some beautiful moments right here, together in this room. You ever hear voices in your head? SAL: How many fucking hours of pleasure did I give you? No. FRANKLIN: Um... What are you saying? You're talking about, like, schizophrenia or something. It is. Well, you know, I've had bouts, and one of the reasons that I've always loved talking to you was that you seem to be a tremendously empathetic person, so I feel I'm being understood when I talk to you. I'm not trying to impose my own... psychological intricacies on you, but... This all sounds really abstract, and I... You know, and I appreciate you coming here and being concerned. I don't know that I need concern. I just... Like something just kind of blew up, and I have to... you know, figure out how to get out of whatever I'm feeling. Like a collision of ideas and frustration and like a turning point, kind of, in my life and dealing with family and relationships, and, you know, you've been there. What about the guy, Sal? Do you still have anything to do with... No. That's done. A long time ago. He's just a crazy person. And how about the new guy, the graduate student- slash-lecturer. Leon. Yeah. He...

I sense it at this point in you, and, uh... Just give me the money.

Of course she could have claimed innocence. She was simply trying to prevent herself from being murdered by someone in the grip of desperation. She had been a fraction of an inch from death, so naturally she had to entice and defend, to struggle and disarm. There was a moment when she had clearly wrested the gun from his loosened grip, a split-second when her brain had said, "I have it now," and then the gun had gone off. But it hadn't just gone off. It hadn't fired by itself. Somehow she had squeezed the trigger without ever actually willing to do so. It was as if she hadn't killed him. The gun had. And she had just happened to be holding it when it performed its deed. However absurdly self-exonerating those words may have sounded, she believed them to be true Besides, what else could she have done? Leap back and point the gun at his heart? Threaten to shoot him? Order him to leave? Was there any likelihood he would have obeyed? Or would he almost certainly have sprung at her, grabbed back the gun and shot her instead? In any case, the chance to change her mind was gone. She had driven past any red line of free will, both literally and figuratively. The die was cast.

Any trace of remorse, let alone guilt, which she had expected to seize her, vanished as quickly and as finally as the trunk she had rolled into the river. She felt she had taken the only path she could have followed and would take it again now if forced back into the same circumstance. It confirmed her deepest sense of morality, that general rules and laws which ignored nuance and exception were never to be trusted, let alone blindly followed. Each case presented its own open spaces for discovery. She had pronounced herself not guilty in the court of her own judge and jury.

He'd been arrested and was released on bail. He came asking for money. I said no, and he left. Just like that? No, he carried on for a little. Who the fuck are you, huh? - Please. - ...you know, but yes. - Did he threaten you? - No. Did he become physical with you? No. No slapping? No choking? No. - Nothing sexual? - No. I said nothing physical, no. This is strange. Why is it strange? Well, because on the tapes, he sounds like he's becoming physically aggressive with you. - What tapes? - The tapes of his phone calls. - You've been recording him? - Of course. For how long? That's confidential. - And I'm on them? - Of course you are. You have nothing to worry about. - They're not targeting you. - Why should they be? I'm not saying that they should be or they shouldn't be, but they're not. Do I need a lawyer? That depends. Now, when was the last time you saw him? Yesterday. Oh, you said that. Yeah, yesterday. Detective Sinclair, he trailed Conforti to this building, presumably to meet with you. Unfortunately, after he parked his car across the street, he was attacked by an urgent case of the runs, and after he'd solved that personal problem, and he came back to his surveillance post, Conforti was gone. Um, how long was he up here? Not long. Um... N-Not long. But he did leave. Of course he left. There's no chance that he's still up here right now? [laughs] No, not at all.

Why did you do that? - The money. - Come here. Sweetie, you... Wow, you guys are everywhere. Well, if I were you, I would assume yes, we are... ...everywhere. So what's the answer? Why did you say it was an accident? This is gonna sound so absurd. I have been, like, super high-strung and really... really dealing with some serious anxiety.

I'm constantly frustrated, and I guess talking about it is helpful, you know, to sort of try to unravel whatever it is that's happening, but at the same time, it also, like, brings up anxiety because these are exactly the things that I can't, like, put a finger on or figure out or...

Of course not. The opposite. It was easy to figure out that you were a very, very special child. But was I, like... I don't know. Did I ever, like... Was I ever violent or aggressive or... Violent? Well, you certainly weren't ordinary. You were never ordinary, so I guess, in that sense of the word, uh, we could stretch it out to saying you were odd. Is that what you mean? Certainly not violent. You were not violent. You never had a violent bone in your body. You've always been a loving, caring, and compassionate person. I love you so much. I love you, Mama. I love you.

Why don't you come in? - You want a drink or something? - Why didn't you believe it? Sometimes, you know, he gets a little forgetful. Can I get you a drink or something? Okay with me. You want wine or water or... I'm having wine. I'll have a little wine. Fine, fine. Thank you. I'm sorry you missed him. Take a seat on the couch. This whole day has just been... Ugh. I mean, it's nice to meet you. I'm just sorry that you missed my grandfather. - I didn't even know... - Thank you. - You guys were friends. - I'm sorry to hear about that. Well, I wouldn't call us exactly friends. I haven't talked to him or seen him since I'm 15 years old, and he did me a great favor. I came up from a pretty tough school. And the high school we went to, Far Rockaway High School, a bunch of these kids from reform school were there and made my first week... There were these tough kids from Auburn. This place called Auburn. Really tough kids. I happened to be in the gym. I was playing a little basketball, and this guy comes over... I'll never forget... this Marvin Bligh, his name was. He walks over, and he says, "Hey, Jew boy. Look over here at me." And he spit in my face. I didn't know what the hell to do. He and his friends were there, or at least the people that he knew, maybe five, six, seven of these guys. They just kept chanting, "Stairwell, stairwell." Which meant to go to the stairwell, and that's where you have the fight. And I went to the stairwell, and I figured the only thing I could do to save it... because sooner or later, they were all gonna get me... I grabbed the guy by the head, and I kept banging it against the stairwell, and he started to bleed. And I thought the other guys would jump on me, but they really didn't. They just pulled me off of him. They were gonna expel me and bring me up on juvenile charges. Now, where does your father... grandfather come in? Well, he was there in the stairwell, and four of the kids... Which sort of restored my faith in human nature. I never had much faith. I still don't. To say "restored" isn't the right word, I guess. But makes me think there is a good side to people. And I think that, with some people, anyway. All four of 'em told the dean that I was completely innocent. This guy had spit in my face, and what could I do? And then they even made up some stuff about how when I went in the stairwell, he started smacking me, which really didn't happen 'cause I jumped him, but... And the dean had no choice but to let me go and say, "Okay." And it sort of changed my life in a strange way. First of all, I had more faith in certain people. But it also... I was a smart kid in school. You know, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard were looking for a guy like me, a Jewish kid at the worst high school in America or New York. And I got into these colleges. I never would have got in if I had been charged, so... But when I saw these guys leave... they weren't even talking to me, they just left... I went over to 'em, and I said to 'em, "I owe you a favor." And one day, one day, whenever you want, you can call on that favor." I said, "All of you are gonna call on this one day." And I never saw your grandfather again, but three of them called the favor in. And I've lived up to it. And I helped them, and they all did well. And I never heard from your grandfather. Until now? Till now, tonight. What did he want? He didn't say. He said to come up and see him. He said he needed help. Do you know what he wanted? He said, "I need help." - No. - "And I'm calling you." Interestingly, he remembered it 'cause he did say... He said, "You owe me a favor." It's going back... Jesus, I feel older than I always felt, you know? Think about it. 65 years. My God. Makes me feel emotional about it. - Yeah. - Feel bad that he never called. Well, tell me about yourself a little, Vera. Well, uh... I don't really know where to begin. I've had such a strange night, you know. You had a strange night? You know, I'm an old poker player. It sounds like you got some problems, but... I don't even know where to start. Maybe I'm being forward, but it sounds like you got a few problems. I could share some things with you. ♪♪ [holy] VERA: Her sense of existing outside herself by connecting to other people had always been tenuous, and it extended only rarely and briefly beyond the two people who had always been there. Now even that fragile aspect of her being was receding without remorse, but she was determined to hold on. Suddenly, inexplicably, the violent churning in her stomach, which had seized her immediately after the killing, disappeared, replaced by a thoroughly irrational calm, a near-beatific felicity. It hardly disturbed her that she accepted so quickly what she had done. Manslaughter, accidental homicide, murder. It was a killing no matter the word. The path ahead was clear. She would follow her most urgent reaction to each moment in her life and confront the consequences as they emerged. Maybe she could even, through her words, help to stir some understanding in people she would never meet. If she could somehow manage shape her own turmoil into ideas and stories, which would reach them as she has been reached and even transformed by creators she had never met, people who had given her a sense of meaning and purpose, however tenuous and fragmented. Any other path would lead to chaos and madness, to the annihilation of the self, without which no life worth living was possible. Perhaps then, her mercilessly demanding brain would be appeased, and she might have a chance to savor and exult in the marvelous, irresistible uncertainty of the future. ♪♪ [continues] [sirens blaring] [sirens growing louder] This is not a dream.
