It's Lisa. Yes, he's leaving for Tokyo at last. I really want to see you, you know? I'll wait for you. Come right away. It's me. Serious air disaster. No survivors. Thirty-five English people among the victims. Mr. Brenton? Mrs. Baumer is here. Show her in. Please take a seat. You know why I took the liberty of disturbing you? Well, to recap, about a year ago your husband took out a life insurance policy at our Athens office with you as the beneficiary, and you said you knew nothing about it. My husband and I were very independent. Mr. Baumer often left you alone. His business was based in Greece. He came to London from time to time. Don't think badly of me, he was much older than me. The policy in your favour is worth a million dollars. Almost Â£400,000. - You're going to give me a million dollars? - Exactly. Our company in Athens will have no problem paying you the money you're entitled to after the necessary formalities. That's everything, madam. Condolences on behalf of my company as well. Please call Peter Lynch for me. I'm calling from outside. They're bound to be tapping my phone. No, I didn't have any problems. I'll cash in the policy in Athens. I'm leaving tomorrow. I want to see you. No, please try... Try to be free soon. Alright, I'll call you back in half an hour. Leave me alone. What else do you want from me? Don't be frightened. You've got nothing to be afraid of. You don't interest me anymore. You can fuck whoever you want. Why don't you leave me in peace, then? See what you've turned into. Don't delude yourself, the drugs haven't completely destroyed me. On the contrary, my memory's clearer and my imagination's more fertile. Now it's you who depends on me. Really? And what makes you think that? I've got proof that you wanted to get rid of your husband. You wrote it in a letter you sent me about a year ago. That doesn't mean I murdered him. Certain phrases have explosive connotations. Now that a plane's crashed with your husband aboard and an insurance policy has turned up paying you... I've got nothing to be afraid of. I wouldn't risk it if I were you. How much do you want for that letter? I need five hits a day now, and it's getting more and more expensive. A hundred pounds now and another hundred at your place tonight. You've got to give me another three hundred. And then from seven o'clock tonight you'll never hear about Philip again. It's not here. The letter... I booked a room in the name of Lisa Baumer. Room 303, third floor. - Here it is. - Sign here. Room 425, fourth floor. Please sign here. May I? Of course. Evidently fate decided we should meet again. Well, rather than fate, I'd say it was your job, Mr. Lynch. You work for Intercontinental Insurance Limited. As you can see, I have my own informants, too. Surprised? No, nothing's really private these days. I admit defeat. Off you go. I'll show you to your table. Follow me. Don't waste your time. I cheated on my husband, but I'm not guilty of anything else. Mrs. Baumer, this is for you. I'm sorry, I've got to go. No, please don't get up. I hope the surroundings don't make you stand on ceremony. They're very well suited to a farce or tragedy. Don't you think so? So you're Lara. Make yourself at home. I must advise you I only came here out of courtesy, so please don't waste my time. That depends on you, dear. Sharif, my lawyer. Kurt's widow. So why do you want to talk to me? I'm not one to beat around the bush. You're here to cash in Kurt's life insurance. You know how to seize your opportunities on the fly. What are you insinuating? That it was you who made that plane crash. Stop right there! I'm not staying here to listen to you. But you will listen to me. Kurt wanted to divorce you and marry me. He wanted to change the beneficiary of the policy. You found out and had him killed. That money belongs to me. You're mad. No court in the world would recognise you had any right to that money. My lawyer has a completely different opinion. Isn't that true, Sharif? Isn't that right? He's not much of a lawyer, but he's got a special talent for making people disappear without a trace. You killed Kurt. And you've got to pay me for what I lost. I didn't kill anyone. You can tell that to the inquest commission who are investigating the plane crash. If I reported you, the insurance company would block the payment of the million dollars. Whereas if you were to sign a document giving me half the money, you could count on me showing my gratitude. Otherwise I'd be forced to get revenge for Kurt. Sharif, stop her. - I knew you'd get in trouble sooner or later. - Get me out of here. - Let's go to the police. - No, to the hotel. Please forget what happened. - I want to explain... - Tomorrow. We'll talk it over tomorrow. And thanks for what you did for me tonight. At the risk of repeating myself, it would be sensible not to cash the check, but to deposit it in your London bank. And then you could think about transferring it. As I said, I'd prefer the cash. Please sign here, here and here. Go to the bank to collect the funds, which we've asked them to make available to you. One million. I don't think there's anything else. Please wait a minute. How can I help you? What time's the first flight to Tokyo? Let's have a look. Here it is. The first flight is this evening at nine o'clock. Alright. I'd like one first-class ticket. There's no one there. The villa's almost always empty and the janitor's gone into town today. Thanks, I'll try again tomorrow. A call from Tokyo for you. - At last... - Please go ahead. - Is that you? - The money? All done. I'm leaving on the nine o'clock flight tonight. Speak to you soon. Has Mrs. Baumer come down yet? No, sir. She had lunch in her room and asked not to be disturbed until 7:30pm. I'll be leaving the hotel this evening. I'd like a taxi for 8:15pm. Call her again. Tell her the taxi's waiting for her. She's not answering. That's strange. Maybe she went out without leaving the key. Mrs. Baumer called about seven and asked for a taxi at quarter past eight. She hasn't been out since then. Let's find out why she's not answering. Come with me. Presumed time of death, Doctor? - 7:00 or 7:30pm. That's enough photos. Cover her. Looks like the work of a sex maniac. But a million dollars have disappeared, too. As far as I'm aware, you're the only person who knew the victim here in Athens. I'm a police inspector. Didn't you hear what I said? Yes, but it's not true. There was someone else. Someone who tried to kill her two nights ago in an old theatre in the city. - Who? - That's what I'd like to know, too. Lisa didn't want to tell me anything. He was a big, tall man. And there was a woman, too. A redhead, I think. I didn't have time to get a good look. We'll check it out. What did you do yesterday afternoon? I had lunch in the hotel. Then I requested a call to London at about three. I waited an hour and twenty minutes at the bar. And who did you speak to in London? With Mr. Brenton, the director of the life branch of Intercontinental Limited. What's your relationship with Intercontinental? I went from slave to boss. I've worked for them for eleven years. I had the job of checking out that woman, and I investigated her responsibility for the plane crash which gave her that payout. And what did you do after the phone call? I was at our office in Athens, where they told me that Mrs. Baumer had been there to withdraw the million dollars and wanted it in cash. So you knew she'd cashed the check. Go on. Then I went for a trip round town. Why? Mr. Lynch, your alibi can only be partially confirmed. And I'm thinking you're very perceptive and you think you've got the murderer. Well, let's say I never trust appearances. - Remember Plato? - Vaguely. Now we'll go to Baumer's villa. I can't go yet? Didn't you say someone tried to kill you yesterday morning? I don't think I'll let you leave Greece that easily. I love Greece. In fact my grandfather was called Homer. - I believe he was born near here. - Very interesting. London says that Mr. Lynch is here in Athens on behalf of Intercontinental Limited to check up on Lisa Baumer. He's beyond suspicion in their eyes, and in mine, too. To whom do I owe all this trust? I'm involved in the same investigation, Mr. Lynch. Let's go. - Inspector, listen... - Inspector, please... - Is he the killer? - Just tell us... Just a minute. Before I give you a name, I need to find him. Please tell us if he's the murderer. He's got a charming smile for a monster. I see we haven't lost our spirit. Everyone hides their desperation as best they can. Remember Oscar Wilde? - Vaguely. - Let's not digress, please. The plane that Baumer was on disappeared into the Pacific Ocean. Unfortunately we'll never know if it was sabotage or just a simple accident. We need to find out why Lisa wanted the money in cash and why she was in such a hurry to get to Tokyo. The person who killed her for the money also knows what happened to the plane. You said that only two nights ago, Mrs. Baumer was threatened in an old theatre in the suburbs by two people... Alright, we'll investigate those two as well. You Interpol people should try to find out who she was going to meet in Tokyo. She got a call from there before she died. Don't worry. We've already looked into it. The call was made from a public phone booth, so it'll be very hard to identify the caller. So find out if any of her London friends went to Tokyo. Here you are - she was sitting at this table. And then that man from the newspaper came. I knew that already. What I don't know is who sent that note to Lisa Baumer. Anybody could show me one of those. Afraid of someone? Come in. What do you want? It's you who wanted something. A million dollars from Lisa Baumer, to be precise. I didn't kill that woman. I didn't say you did. - Can I sit down? It was you, and that evil bastard with the knife. - You're insane. - It was you two who murdered Lisa. Don't pretend you don't recognise me. I saw you with that man in the theatre. But I've never seen you before. Don't lie. I don't know anything. You murdered her for that damn money. For that blasted money. Admit it. I didn't even know that she'd collected the money and hidden it in her room. How could I have known? Calm down. Even the police don't use those techniques anymore, Peter. She was in the theatre with the man with the knife who tried to run me over. He's insane. I've never been in any theatre. Didn't you know Lisa Baumer personally? Kurt spoke to me about her. We were supposed to get married. He was going to change everything - the insurance policy and the will. That woman killed him before he could do it. I'm happy that she's dead. - But I didn't murder her. - Of course not. And no one tried to out my head off a few minutes ago? Did his penknife slip while he was cleaning his nails? If someone wants to kill you, they'll have their reasons. I don't even know who you are. He's an investigator for the company that paid a million dollars to Lisa. Search the place thoroughly. That money should be here, or with her friend who tried to do me in. That's Inspector Stavros's job. Peter, do you have any idea who might have a motive to kill you? No, I really don't. I was following you, knowing that sooner or later you'd bring me to this woman. That's all. In any case, we can safely say that someone's dug up the hatchet. No, he hasn't arrived yet. Who are you? Who should I say called? MY key, please. Mr. Lynch, a young Frenchwoman came and left this for you. "This is the first time a 'suspect' turned out to be photogenic! "How about an interview over lunch at Dionisio's?" What's that, lunch or a workout? One becomes cynical working on crime news. May I sit down? Of course. The usual, please. Do you enjoy eating here? Why? Don't you like French cooking? You're something French that I like. My paper will pay a lot for an exclusive. What is this, lunch or an interview? A bit of both. Stanley told me that they tried to cut your head off yesterday. Yes, that's right. But since it was my head and not his, he didn't attach much importance to it. If it was Lisa Baumer's murderer, he must be a real idiot. Why? Well, with a million dollars, I'd become a model citizen. Maybe he's afraid of being caught. Or maybe you know something that could send him to the gallows. I've told the police everything I know about Lisa Baumer several times. It's my profession. No. It doesn't hold water. You've got to know something else. Something which has slipped your mind, some detail that you've forgotten but the murderer's afraid of. What are you thinking about? I don't know. There's something I can't remember which could be the missing link in the story. Why did Lisa withdraw the million dollars in cash? Why did she suddenly decide to leave for Tokyo? Who was waiting for her there? One of her lovers, or maybe an accomplice. The person responsible for the plane crash. And why not her husband? Her husband was on that plane. You know what? I'm going to quit. As soon as Stavros gives me my passport, I'll get them to take me off the case. After all, dealing with dead people isn't my area. Dealing with living people is. I won't report this part of the interview in the article. So that's the local police's technique. - Why would they have done it? - For the money. But why take it out on your mattress? Don't you get it? They really think I killed that woman. And they hoped to find the money in the mattress. No, this isn't the work of the police. They ripped everything apart as if they hated it. Here, look. What could you hide in a curtain? They've just destroyed it. - What are you doing? - Changing rooms, of course. - I hope this is to your liking. - Don't worry, I'll take care of the clothes. - The manager wanted to express... - He can express it tomorrow. The way things are going, I've got the feeling that changing rooms won't be enough. I should change hotel, city and profession. To us, in spite of everything. To everything, in spite of us. It's becoming philosophical. I don't like to sip. - Me neither. - What did you put in my glass? You've drugged me. I always do it to increase my charm. ...including killing that young man in London. - We should have got rid of Lisa immediately. - Someone smarter than us got there first. I was sure Peter Lynch was involved. So we've got it wrong again. I've got another idea. I'll see you tomorrow at the usual place. Alright, see you tomorrow. Who's there? Sharif, come here. Now. Somebody's breaking down the door. Come quickly. Lara? What's happening? What is it? Like the other woman. - Who is it? - Sorry. I didn't tell anyone. I didn't know I'd end up here tonight. Yes, I'll come right away. I've got to go. They've killed another woman. Looks like the murderer's the same one who killed Mrs. Baumer. You've really got to go? Some people on the paper are waiting for an excuse to kick me out. They say it's not a woman's job. As if seeing people with their guts hanging out was a man's job. Luckily the editor's on my side. If he wasn't... Did they say who the murdered woman was? Yes, her name's Lara Florakis. She lived in the old town. Autopsy report. Abdominal wound caused by a cut from the pubic-umbilical line to the edge of the xiphoid process of the sternum. Wound to the anterior base of the neck in the form of a sloping italic S. Abdominal wound similar to the previous one. Wound to the anterior base of the neck more or less like the previous one. Knife wound near the malleolus in the posterior region of the leg. Knife wound to the hand on the skin covering the metacarpal joints near the proximal phalanges. That's enough. That'll do for now. We're dealing with an expert. I've rarely seen such precise work. So... You were watching that woman, too. Doesn't Interpol have anything to say? I think that finding the killer is no longer Interpol's job. In my opinion, we're dealing with a madman, a sex maniac. A maniac who only kills Kurt Baumer's women and steals a million dollars? Even sex maniacs have bills to pay. I see that Intercontinental Limited are conspicuously generous with their expenses. They're fair, in the circumstances. If you say so. It looks like someone hoped to find the treasure in your room. With all that stuff in the papers about me and the million dollars, who knows how many people besides you have been tempted to take a look in my room. Sure, but not in that way. Someone wants to throw suspicion on you. Thanks for the information the other night, John. My pleasure. So it was you who called ClÃ©o. I try to help her out when I can. Right. And how did you know she was with me? You're one of the suspects. Stavros is watching you all the time. You shouldn't be upset, at least not while that butcher is still at large. Yes, but it won't be easy to catch him. All the leads have turned into dead ends. No, there's one that's going somewhere. The killer has a million dollars. All trains, planes and ships are being monitored. It's not easy to make a million dollars vanish, believe me. Oh, yes, that's true. But whoever stole it could hide it in their mattress and sleep on it for ten years. I'm not so sure. When a man kills like that for money, he can't even sleep on it for a month. I think my friend Stanley's right. That money will be the murderer's downfall. - In any case, please don't leave Athens. - I've no intention of leaving. - Do you like it? You're very kind. I'll be back in six days. Don't forget to turn off the electricity if you go away, and leave the keys with the porter. If it's for me, I'll take it. Yes, he's arrived. Wait a moment. It's for you. I'm going or I'll miss my plane. Bye. And thanks for your hospitality. Don't get distracted. There are some things you shouldn't do at the table. Taste it. Do you like it? What's wrong? Does it need more paprika? No, no. On the contrary. I'll never let you waste your time in the kitchen again. It's that creep from the floor above. - What do you want? - Your car's blocking the entrance. Alright, alright. I'll come down and move it now. Send the porter next time, or I'll make you lose interest in sticking your nose into other people's business. He's right. I left the car in front of the entrance. I'll be back straight away. Don't move. What time is it? The best time of my life. Shame... I've got a load of photos to develop for tomorrow. No, stay here. - You can't make love all day. - Why not? You can always try. Then you lie down in the sun and start again. Are you serious? I've never been more serious in my life. My desire to give it all up and leave is growing every clay. Just think, a boat and the open seas of the world. Free and happy. Every so often you come back to see how things are going. When? I don't know, in autumn. Not this one... the next. Or Christmas, who knows? There's a lovely place in the Tuamotu Islands waiting for us. You need a bit of money to live without doing anything. Yes, that's true. A bit of money... So let me go to work and earn some. ClÃ©o, would you come with me if I asked you? I don't know. Off you go to work, then, slave. Damn, the electricity's gone off. Who's there? ClÃ©o? It's me. I forgot my car keys. ClÃ©o, can you hear me? What's going on? Open the door. Don't go, Peter. Don't go. He tried to kill me. Calm down, ClÃ©o. Let me have a look. It's not serious. Come on, it's not a deep wound. Wait. Is Inspector Stavros there? Tell him they've tried to murder another woman, ClÃ©o Dupont. Send an ambulance to 121 Colonakis Street. Quickly. Oh, Peter, he could come back. Don't be afraid. He's a bastard who only attacks women. Did you recognise him? Did you notice anything? No, it was so dark. I saw... I only saw the blade of that knife. - I never thought I could be so scared. - Calm down. I never thought... Calm down. It's over now. No, Mr. Lynch. You're more useful here. What has happened? - ClÃ©o's still in shock. I'd better go... - There are doctors for that. Come with me. - They've taken her away already? I had to break down the door, and when he saw me he escaped through the window. They cut the wires. Someone got in while ClÃ©o was working in there. Someone who knew the apartment well and could find the main switch in seconds. Are you trying to say it was me? First Lisa, then Lara and now ClÃ©o. And you. You every time. What? I was shouting behind that door while someone was trying to murder ClÃ©o. Calm down. Anyway, ClÃ©o's not dead and she'll give us her version. Right. At least the victim can still speak this time. Go ahead with your dusting for prints. - It won't be that useful. - They'll find my prints all over the place. Yes, I know, but there's always hope we'll find others. Is that yours? Could be a lead. It looks pretty rare. I'm sorry, but it's hard to say. - Maybe if I saw the original... - I don't have the original. I just want to find out who made it. Is it one of a series, is it something that anyone could make, or... - Are you from the police? - No. So? It's quite rare. I don't think there's anyone left in Greece who can work filigree like that. It's almost certainly an Eastern technique, maybe from Turkey. It's hard to say. I'd told that woman it wasn't very sensible to withdraw a million dollars in cash. Yes, but if Lara Florakis's death is connected to that money, I don't understand why they just tried to kill ClÃ©o Dupont. Don't worry too much about it. Nobody will fire you if you don't find the money. Our company doesn't expect you to be like Sherlock Holmes. I came here hoping that talking about it would unlock that little something in my head. Never mind. Listen, do you have a photo of Kurt Baumer here? Do we have a photo of Kurt Baumer? The one that was in the papers. It must be in the press office. Get them to leave a copy for Mr. Lynch at reception. Right away. It probably won't be any use, but thanks anyway. ClÃ©o! How are you? They're sending you home? When? Tomorrow? I'll come and get you. Yes, of course. What does he want with me? Are you watching ClÃ©o for work or are you in love with her like I am? I like people with a sense of humour, Mr. Lynch. I like their jokes so much that I'd like to hear them in my office in, say, ten minutes. Yes, of course you've got time to shave... on your way here. I can't stand inappropriate humour. What have you got against Peter Lynch? Can't you accept that he saved my life? My dear woman, I've already said I... ...can't stand inappropriate humour. Your hands. What? I'd like you to show me your hands. May I know why? To predict your future. ClÃ©o bit that man on the hand. Yes, but she also told me that the bastard was wearing leather gloves. I don't believe Cleo has fangs. Inspector, why don't you look at this if you're looking for a bite mark? I cut myself with a glass. A straight cut isn't proof of his innocence. The murderer could have covered the teeth marks with another cut. If you're finished with your nonsense, Mr. Lynch, you can go. Of course, if you've finished with yours. The investigation into the theft of a million dollars continues without results. Even though the motive isn't clear, certain elements of the attack on the journalist ClÃ©o Dupont appear to connect the event to the Baumer case. The police are now following up on a scorpion cuff link dropped by the attacker in the French journalist's apartment on the night of the attempted murder, hoping it will lead them to the person who committed the crimes. However, Inspector Stavros, who is leading the investigation, doesn't seem very optimistic about recent results. That's the latest news. That was the evening news. Now we have a special program filmed in Los Angeles to celebrate Thanksgiving Day. This is Mark Salomon from Los Angeles. The whole city has spilled out onto the great avenues to watch the phantasmagorical nocturnal procession that will conclude the Thanksgiving celebrations. Coloured light from hundreds of floodlights illuminates the city's most beautiful girls. It's a tribute to beauty and youth. It's America, with all its optimism and zest for life. In other words, wonderful America! And what wonders! Accompanied by a host of brass bands, representatives from universities, colleges and high schools file past alongside members of organizations from Los Angeles and other major American cities. You're not going to kill me. It's a feast for the eyes and hearts of millions of Americans who are watching this spectacle. A festival of sound and light as brilliant as our country, the beat of the music in unison with the hearts of these young girls who are marching toward a bright future with a radiant smile. George, is that you? Look, it's me who should be sick, not you. What's wrong? I feel like I'm missing something. You know when you can't quite get something into focus? Getting things into focus is my job. Cleo, you've got an enlarger at home, haven't you? Of course. It's very grainy, but we should be able to see it. This would also explain the death of that air steward, Lisa's last lover. Maybe he knew something. Kurt Baumer could still be alive and at large here. It's a bit of a risky theory, but... we've got to go with it for now. Let's analyse this theory, then. Kurt Baumer takes out a policy for a million dollars, payable only in the event of his death. He gets someone to board the plane under his name, maybe with the steward's help, and puts a time bomb in his suitcase. The game's on. Lisa comes to Athens and gets the money, maybe in agreement with him. But in any case, Kurt had already decided to get rid of his wife and take all the money. Who would suspect him? He's legally dead. But Lara Florakis knew something. Her and her friend. Why not get rid of them and the air steward, who appeared to be here to meet someone? Sure. But then attacking ClÃ©o just to give us the cuff link? I don't understand what risk ClÃ©o would have posed either. Maybe to increase the number of victims and make us think he was a maniac. No, he had another reason. If Peter hadn't gone back and we'd found her dead, we'd have been involved in a miscarriage of justice. That's it. The real reason for attacking Cleo was to make us charge Peter Lynch. He almost managed that anyway. Indeed. What do you think? The theory holds up. Maybe we can catch this man if we let him think we've fallen into his trap. Do you feel like playing the part of a wanted man? I've still got the boat at Piraeus. I could take it and get out of the way for a while. In the meantime, you'll pretend to look for me. Speaking of which, my doctor said I should go on a cruise. Not a bad idea. That'll make it even more believable. Is there a radio on your boat? Of course. It's very important to stay in touch. What do you think? Very good. We'll send you messages in code. You'd better go now. Use that door. Yes. Let them go. One more thing, Inspector. I think I deserve an exclusive. You've got the exclusive on Peter Lynch. Come in. Take a seat. This is the life. It'll do for me. We go where the wind takes us. The most important thing is love. See, you're learning how to live. What do you want? Is this Kurt Baumer's villa? It was. A bank took custody of it after Mr. Baumer's death. A bank? Aren't there any heirs? I don't know. My boss owed the bank money, so... Could I take a look inside, please? Uh... why not? Did you work for Mr. Baumer for a long time? The war was still on. I met him in hospital. We were both badly injured. I was full of grenade shrapnel. Peter, why have you got that sack? To carry my spare harpoons and other equipment. Don't worry. I was in the English team for five years. So, Peter, did you catch the whale? It got away. I'll try again tomorrow. This definitely changes everything. It's the only plausible theory. We'll have to bluff it. You're too curious, ClÃ©o. The world's full of people who made their fortune sinking old ships full of unlucky souls to collect the insurance money. When I saw Baumer's policy, I decided that million dollars would be mine. George Barnet, the air steward, was my partner in crime while I needed a partner. It wasn't hard for him to put a bomb on the plane. Lisa was his lover and she was supposed to meet him in Tokyo. We'd have made her disappear there, together with the million dollars. But I couldn't have predicted that Lara would have the same intentions as me, so I had to put the money in a safe place. You... You killed all those people. Lisa, Lara... for that money. How could you have done it? "There's a crime behind every great fortune." You should know that. A Frenchman wrote it. But how could it have been you that night, with me? You were outside the door. You saved me. The police suspected me. I'd never have got out of Greece with the money. So I had the idea of bringing Baumer back to life. I got the air steward to have a replica made in Turkey of those cuff links I'd seen in the photo. And to attack you. You're mad, Peter. Open up. What are you doing? Open up. Don't touch that radio. Can anyone hear me? Call the police. Call Inspector Stavros. This is ClÃ©o Dupont speaking, from Peter Lynch's boat. We're still at Nimis island. He's the murderer. It's Peter Lynch. He's going to kill me. If you don't push this up... it doesn't transmit messages. No one will ever catch us, and you... you'll live with me. We've got a million dollars. Why did you want to know? Peter, you're sick. They'll cure you, you'll see. Don't ever say that again, ClÃ©o. Even They haven't told us their location since last night. It'll be very difficult to find them. They could be far away by now. It's all over now. And Peter? He's gone where the police will never be able to reach him. Peter was mad. A clear-headed kind of madness which was hard to discover. How did you realise he was guilty? The answer was hidden in this box. When I questioned the steward's hostess friend for the last time, I noticed a brooch on her dress that was made in the same way as the cuff link. The girl told me that the brooch was a present the steward had brought her from Turkey. So I thought the cuff link could have been used to trick us. And when I found the original cuff links in Baumer's house, I was sure of it. Peter was the only suspect left. We hoped he'd give himself away, but you found everything out before we did. Now you're fully recovered. Take a long holiday and forget this nasty business. Have a good trip. I didn't know you were still in Athens. I was waiting for a beautiful clay and a beautiful girl before I left.
