- Nah. - Yeah. - No. - Yeah. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yeah. - All right, everybody. What tactics did Charlotte use to be able to achieve her goal in the scene? - She made him uncomfortable by lifting up his shirt. - Yes. She gained power in the scene by making him feel uncomfortable enough to give up the chair. But, she tried a variety of different tactics in order to get what she wanted, which is what we should be doing in every scene that we read. Thank you Kieran. Thank you Charlotte. Now, I'm sure you're all very anxious to know what this season's production is going to be. We are going to be putting on Billy Elliot, Fin, home time. - Do you want them to know? - Do you ever wonder what people would say at your funeral? - No. I don't think I want to know. - Really? - Yeah. Probably be a bunch of bullshit. - Well, I want a front row seat to my funeral. - Of course you would. - What's that supposed to mean? - I'm teasing. - You're not, I don't care. I wanna hear what they have to say, even if it was all bullshit. - I'd rather rest in peace. - You wouldn't even wanna hear what I would have to say? - Well, why don't you tell me now, while I'm alive? - No. No, you're just gonna have to wait. - Till I'm dead? - Mhm Hm? - Hm? - Hm? - What time is it? - 6:47. - I gotta go. - Okay, let me drive you home. - No. - Come on, don't be an idiot. - Oh, guess I'm an idiot. - Ladies. - We were just obsessing over your brown bread from last week's book club. - Well, I could give you the recipe, but then I'd have to kill you. Come here. Did you hear about Bridgette? - Oh yes, such a shame. - I heard she left him, coz he shacked up with some hussy from Dublin. - She didn't have to go and leave him. - I dunno. - We all have tough shite to deal with. - Well, it's not setting a very good precedent for us. That's all. - How's Kay doing with her CAO submissions? - She's got a few she's looking at. - She's such a special girl. I'm sure she'll end up in the right place. - Hey K. - Don't call me that. - Sorry man, my bad. - What's up Finn? - Yeah, not much. I kind of just was wondering if we could talk? - Okay. - Well seeing as how you always get, usually get the best parts, I just thought that maybe I could get like a little bit of advice off you. - Listen mate, I've gotta go. - All right, yeah, no worries, man. Hey, maybe we can like get a coffee before audition sometime or..? - Yeah, sure. - Alright, cool. I'll see you. - Mams got the dinner nearly ready. - Hope she didn't make her brown bread again. - I'll be in in a sec. - Need any help? - No, I'll be fine. - Okay. - Now. For what we are about to receive, may we be truly thankful. Amen. - So, ready for your last day of school, Kay? - Meats a bit dry. - Just in time too. I could do with your help. I think the minxes are back again. Could be a bit of a frenzy. Alastar slacked off fixing the holes in the hen house last season. - I saw Elizabeth down in the shop. She says, Sean needs a date for the debs. And it's perfect. You're looking so much better. Now that her hair has grown out a bit. - I have auditions. - Her hair is looking nice, don't you think Declan? - Is that the same Sean who was caught running naked down the street last week after a few too many pints? - Let's not pretend you haven't made a bigger fool of yourself. - Meat's good. Come in. - Good time? I was thinking about those damn minxes again. Remember the time Alastar thought one of them was the cat and spent hours trying to catch it? - He even got up that tree. It's late. - I'll give you a lift to school tomorrow, okay? - No, you're all right. - Come on. It's your last day. All right. I get the message. - What did they say about the lads in England? They're uh... They're quite fit. - They can't be that different. - Literally any variation of the translucent eejits, beats the plague of pink dick that Ireland faces. - Pink dick? - Yeah, pink dick. I thought Sean would be different because you know, he tans during the summer kind of, but couldn't have been more wrong. - Wait, you and Sean? - Yeah, I rode him last week. Remember? You coming? - Oh, I'll catch up. Dad? Mam? - How many times have I- Fuck, fuck, fuck- - Mam. Mam it- Mam, it's not what it looks like, okay? Mam, mam, please. - Declan! Declan! It's gone too far. - Mam. Ahhh! - Oi! I have to practice my audition. - Come on. - No, I'm serious. - Kieran. Kieran. - Do you have any idea what we've been going through? We've been attacked. We've been fined. We've been arrested. The last thing that we need is some fuckin' do gooder pissing about our family. Putting ridiculous ideas into our heads. Ballet. What are you trying to do m- Was it my intonation? - I would really like you to read for Billy. - I would like to support my peers for once instead of leading them. - Oh, come on. - Why don't we give Finn a shot? - Lookit. There are enough parts for everyone to go around and since when are you worried about who gets, what part? - Since I realized that in the real world, it doesn't always work like this. - Like what, Mr. Dearg? - Like, I won't be getting the lead always. - Look, you're looking to go to drama school, right? - That's exactly why I want to play Tony. He'd explore my range. - And Billy wouldn't? - I don't wanna play Billy because, he and I are too similar. - Lookit, I really think- - Let me try again. - All right. - Okay. Do you have any idea we've been going through? We've been attacked. We've been fined. We've been arrested. - You are just being angry for the sake of being angry. Yes, Tony, he is prideful to a fault, but it's because he's been formed in a very demanding environment and his masculinity is just a facade. - I know all that. - Look, I really want you to read for Billy. - And I really think that Tony- - Kieran. You are one of my best students and I would be doing you a disservice, if I did not insist that you at least try. Please. - All right. - I actually just now she has me locked in as like supporting character or something. - Prove her wrong then. If you want the lead you have to walk like a lead, your shoulders are perpetually hunched. - No, they're not. - Are too. Hey look how Kieran does it. Kieran. Show Finn here what it looks like to walk like a leading man. - You look like a prick. - Ah, but a leading prick. - He thinks Ms. Doyle doesn't see him as a lead. - Prove her wrong then. - Kay. We're just here to help. - This isn't necessary. - Kay. - You have it wrong. - It's all right, Kay. - It's not all right. It goes against God. - Your mother is right, Kay. Can you please come down here and join us? Whatever you have cooking in there smells amazing. I remember it was a three Christmases ago. I was over and you made a goose. - It was two Christmases ago, father. - Kay. Your hair has grown back nicely. Kay, what your mother saw- - She didn't see anything. - Lies fester, Kay. - I'm not lying. - And the most dangerous lies are the ones we tell ourselves. - We only want what's best for you. - I'm fine. - Denial is typical. Now, with that being said, the first step we need to take is to dispose of the object. - I don't have it. - You wouldn't mind if we searched your room then? - No. I mean, no, all right, I'll get it. - If we are too forceful, she will retaliate. We have to let her think this is her idea, or else she will never truly come to her senses. - Well, I'll put the kettle on. - We need to talk about penance. - Hurling isn't the same since they made the helmets compulsory. - It's the same game just a lot less broken noses. - Well, that's exactly my point. Why are we keeping our boys from getting roughed up? Broken bones, build character. Dec gets it. You were the best character builder on the hurling pitch, weren't ya Dec? How many noses did you break back in the day? - Too many to count. - Exactly. Ah, Jesus Christ. - Quinn came home last night with eye makeup on. He said it was nothing, his pals were just messing around. - You gotta beat that out of him, before it goes too far. - Well, I dunno about that. What do you think Dec? - I don't know. I'm sure, it's probably just a phase. - Bullocks. - Wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as to the Lord, where the husband is head of the wife. As Christ is head of the church and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ. So let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. In the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit. Amen. Thank you all for being here today. But before we call it a Sunday, it's to my understanding, there's a new family in the community from England. Would everyone please join me in welcoming Connor, Keith and his son Egan. - Let's introduce ourselves. - Where did Kay go? - Hey, how you doing? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hey. - Lovely meeting you, finally. We were due new neighbours weren't we Declan? - Hi, I'm Declan Dearg. - Declan, pleasure. - Gwinn. - Gwinn. Erm, I think our kids met earlier in the week. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Wrecked my shed too. - Hey it's alright. I'm still trying to toughen this one up though, you know? No hard feelings, right? - Oh. - No - Kay. Where have you been? - Sorry, dad. I just needed some fresh air. - You just kind of go around disappearing like that. - You beat that poor boy. Such a nasty thing for a girl to do. What does that say about you? Let alone what it says about our family. And you ruined his shed. You'd be lucky if a boy like that took interest in you and you go around beating them up. - You haven't got the full story. He tackled me from behind. - You can't run around blame free, Kay. There are consequences for your actions. - You're right. I'm sorry. - Words, that's all that is. - Gwinny. - No, she needs to knows what a right mess she's made. You were such a good baby. What happened? You're going to make things right with that boy. You'd be lucky if he paid you any mind after all this, but you are sure going to try. Give it. - He would have wanted- - No, I won't hear that. Why must you insist on reminding me constantly? - You're all right, dear. We're all right. Why don't you go upstairs and lie down and I'll bring you up a nice cup of tea. It's been so hard on your mother. - It's been hard on all of us. - Still. You have to show her some understanding. - I don't mean to upset her. - Then why must you? Make nice with that boy. Fix the shed. - You're a Dearg and you don't take shit. Say it. - I'm a Dearg and we don't take shit. - Say it again! - I'm a Dearg and we don't take shit. - Say it again. - I'm a Dearg and we don't take shit! - Oi. - Fuckin' thing. - It's your mess. - It's your shed. It'll be your hole. - What kind of bloke doesn't know how to patch a hole? - The same "bloke" that beats your ass. So you're just gonna lets me fuck this up? - Not gonna do this all for you. - Fucking brute. Here, you pull out the rotten ones, I'll get the new ones. - No, thanks. - Right. Just trying to protect those dainty hands. - Fuck off. - It's a joke. Relax. Egan. - Kieran. - Do you remember that little play you put on for me, for my 35th birthday? What, you must have been seven or eight? - Me mam put me up to that. - I think I distinctly remember you having a good time. - You're mistaken. - Come on. Come with me. Do you believe in God, Kay? - Yes. - Do you believe his creations made in his divine image are holy and perfect? - Mrs. O'Leary's daughter was born blind. - So, the world is unfair. You're going to use that to deflect responsibility for your own actions. We all have our demons Kay. After my brother died, I felt lost just as you do. - He has nothing to do with this. - With what? - With anything. - It's perfectly normal for you to feel, you have to fill the void of his presence. - You have no idea what you're talking about. Do you? You know, just because you were born exactly in accordance to Catholic standard, doesn't make you better than anyone. It just makes you privileged. - I know you're hurt more than you think I do. Just because I was strong enough to face my demons, head on. A coward, like you, will never have the strength to be a man. - Batted away by O'Dudden. Sent to the left corner back. Now back down the pitch, Aberdine with it. Goalie on the attack, Limerick with the pull and Doughtrey is down. Limerick is arguing with the referees and it looks like- - There. - Looks good. - On the outside yeah, but still got fixing inside. - You like fixing stuff? - Need to, more than like to. Trying to make this a studio space for my paintings. - Paintings? - Yeah. What's it to you? Never met a painting puff before? - Uh, no, it's not that, uh it's just. - You're weird. - You are. - Don't get your panties in a twist. Wanna see some of them? - Yeah. - Come on. - It's not much, but it is what it is. Let's see Oh huh. I finished this one right before we left. Sort of a political statement. - Yeah. - I like this one a lot. - What is it? - Um, it's abstract. Here. It could be whatever you need really. Um. - What's that one? - Oh yeah. Well, it was a beautiful landscape painting but, I was pissed off and the beauty pissed me off, so I punched a hole in it. Makes a good statement piece though. Don't you think? - I don't think you should go. - Why not? - I'd miss you. - Fuckin' hell. How was that? - What do you think your intentions are at this point? - Billy is torn. - Don't talk about your character in the third person. It'll just distance you from understanding. Why are you torn? - I don't know. - Put yourself in his shoes. - How could I? - Can you not understand, or sympathize with the feelings? - I don't know. - You don't know? - Yeah. - Alright, everybody take five, Patrick, thank you. Come here. Alright. What's going on? - I told you it'd be difficult. - Well, what's the hangup? - I, don't, know. - Alright. Well then let's call it a day. - Alright. - Yeah? Come ready for rehearsal on Monday. Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. - This was my brothers. I thought you'd like it. - Won't he miss it? - Don't think so. - That's quite cute of you. Suppose you wanna help with the rest? - Just thought you'd like it. - I'd like the help. - Alright. Are we painting all the walls? - Erm, no, we'll make sort of an accent wall. - A what wall? - An accent wall. Three are the same, one's different. I like that sort of stuff. - Why would anyone in the right mind move here? - What made you think my dad's in his right mind? Your brother sounds cool. You should bring him around sometime? - What? I'm not good enough? - That's exactly what I'm saying. C'mon. - What are we doing here? - You never come here? - I mean, I came with my parents, when I was younger. - It's beautiful. - Bet it was more beautiful a few hundred years ago when it was intact. - Nah, I like it like this. - Gwinn, I knocked at the door, but no one answered. So I figured I'd come around. I was just stopping by to return this. - Why don't you come inside? Have a cup of tea. - I didn't realize you worked the land. - Oh, just a bit of gardening. - Sean said, Kay wasn't at the debs. - Oh, she was so busy with the college preparations. - Of course. It's quite the task, watching them grow up and become their own person. - How do you mean? - You know. You have all these ideas in your head since they were babies, of who they're going to be and then when they grow up. - I was about to go wash up. - No it's all right. Did you finish the shed? - Not yet. I have to go back tomorrow and finish off. - Come sit. I know things have been difficult around here lately. I've got something for you. You'll be wearing this to the dinner with our new neighbours. You'll look so good. - Do you really have to have them for dinner? - I'm not going to carry on being the talk of the town Kay. Now, you'll be wearing this and you will be nice to that boy. - He's a prick. - Your dad was a prick until our third date. That's how boys express their feelings. - Oh yeah. Because you and dad are the prime example of a successful relationship. - You know it. - 'Course I do. - 'Course I do Of course I do. - Bullocks. Do you like what you see? - What? No. What's that from? - Me dad gets super homophobic when he's drunk. - Oh. - It's fine, I provoke it. Anyway. Michael Caffrey, love him. - Yeah. - How'd your parents take it? - Take what? - Yous being a puff. - I'm not a puff. - Sure. - Do you want me to beat your arse again? - You'd like that wouldn't you? Puff. - You're looking good up there Kieran. - You think? - Maybe you should give up acting for ballet. - What's up Finn? - What? - What do you mean, what? - I just don't really think you need anyone else blowing up your head, that's all. - He's just jealous, he's ensemble. - How come Ms. Doyle never actually corrects you? - What are you getting at? - Here, don't mind him, I'll talk to him. - Yeah. - Where are they going? Did they find out your big secret? - You're a fucking twat, you know that? - Come on. You're really gonna be that sensitive? - I'm just, I'm not in the mood. Okay? - K... - Why are you reading that? - I am, trying to find a good monologue. - You act? - No, I mean, it's what I want to do. - Sometimes I think I know nothing about you Kieran. Don't be so coy. Have some pride in who you are. - It's whatever. - Let me see what you got. - I haven't really got anything yet. - How about this? - I really, haven't prepared, anything. - You've been watching me paint all morning. Let me see what you got. Come on, get up. Up, up, up. - Alright, alright. Don't um, don't expect much. - On with it. - Okay. He told us we ought to think of Jesus as our buddy. He said he talked to Jesus all the time. Even when he was driving his car, that cracked me up. I could see that big, phony bastard shifting into first gear asking Jesus to send him a few more stiffs. What? - Nothing. - What's wrong with it? - Nothing. Why'd you pick that one? - I don't know. He's tough. I like the way he's tough. - Well, I feel like it's more of a satire, besides there are way better parts. What about this? I was sitting there on that wash bowl and I got bored, so I hopped down and stepped back a few feet and start doing this tap dance, just for- - I didn't criticize your painting. Did I? And guess what? Not everything has to be as as feckin' queer as you. - I'm sorry. - No. No. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm stressed. - It's alright. - Let's go into Dublin tonight. - What about dinner? - Screw dinner. My parents are... My parents are rotten and they'll ruin everything. Please Egan, please, please, let's just go to Dublin and have a good time instead. - Come on. Let's go, before my dad realizes, me mom's earrings he keeps are gone. - What are you wearing? - What are you wearing? - Kieran. - What, Finn? - Oh, what do you not talk to your friends anymore? Is that it? - Piss off, you're drunk. - Are you for... Hold on, man, what, what is this? Oh, I actually just knew you were full of shit, you know? Yeah, I even said it to Braiden. - Yeah. - No actually forget Braiden. Wait till... You know, wait till Charlotte hears about this. I don't think- - Kieran. ♪ Let's go back to having fun ♪ - Who was that? - Can we not? Alright, alright. He is just a lad that I know. - From where? - Acting group. - Get out. - If we're being completely honest, I have something else to get off my chest. - What is it? - I'm playing Billy Elliot in my theatres. production of Billy Elliot. - No, you're not. - I swear. - You're so hot Kieran.

Don't everyone know the you're a liar? - I'm not a liar. - And a cheat. - Why do you care? - It's too much drama. It's too much drama. Anyways, the lies were plaguing my conscience, so, I've come clean. - Everyone will know that you're a lezzy. - He I mean, she, lied to me this whole time. I can't believe it. How could somebody do that? - What are you doing here? - Kieran. I was waiting for you at the shed and ye never showed up. Come on. Let's go. - I can't go out anymore. - You know you want this. - Egan shut up. - Please, please. Please, please, please, please please. - Shut up. - Please, please, please. Kieran please. - Ugh - Please. - Egan stop. Stop. Shut up Egan. Go. Stop. You can't come around here. - Come on. Come on. - Leave. - What's wrong baby? - I said, leave. - I'm not just gonna leave.

She was his mother. - Should have been me. It should have been me. - We have to stick together, as a family, for her sake. - What she wants doesn't exist. She wishes it was me too. - No. No, that's not true. - I'll never be what she wants. No matter how hard that I try. - She loves you. - She loves her idea of me. - Kay. - You know it. - What about me? Please. I can't lose you. - Oi painting boy. Painting's looking really nice. - So you're allowed to meddle in my things, but not me in yours. - Egan, I'm sorry. - I don't know you Kieran. - What? Come on, course you do. I said, I'm sorry. Shall I compare the thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May. And summer's lease hath all too short a date. Every fair from fair sometime decline, either by chance or by nature's changing course. But thy eternal summer, shall not fade. - You know, you're officially a bigger puff than me. It can't be like this Kieran. - I know. - I want to help you. - But I've been where you are and I can't go back. - I don't want to do that, okay? I won't. - Promise. - Promise. - Oh, sorry. Cross. You know, I bet your mom's acting this way, because she'd be sad if you left. - When I leave. Acting school or not, I can't stay here. - Right? When you leave, I'm sure she'll miss you. - I honestly don't care. You know, if I'm lucky, I'll forget about this whole bleedin' island. Easy there killer. - What do you care? - Come on. - Tell me something I don't know about you. - Ummm. I don't know. - There has to be something. - You know more about me than anyone. - So I know everything? - I don't know everything about you. Isn't a little mystery the point? - The point of what? - I don't know. Dating. - Oh, so we're dating now. - I just meant that we're clear- - What if I went with you? - To London? - Yeah I mean, there's nothing for me here and I got people for help us out there. - Oh, oh, okay. You, got people. Yeah. - You're serious? - You're not? What's so bloody important about here anyway? - You. - Alright folks, that's it for today. And now show was up in one week, alright? So if you're not off book by now, God help me. And next months rent. God. Oh! Ummm... uh, And don't forget your tickets on the way out, before you leave. Collect them at the front, alright? Yeah. Bye. Mr. Dearg, we missed you at rehearsals today. - I had a family emergency. I should have called, but, yeah. - Yesterday too? Your stand in sucks anyway. - It won't happen again. - Do you know who my greatest inspiration is? - Who? - Him. He always rises. Even though every day he falls. - Yeah, until he explodes and brings us all to a fiery death. - Well, if that's all you're anticipating, then he's already killed you. We can only try our best, right? - Right. - Right. Then I will see you tomorrow for dress rehearsal. Right? - Right. - Oh and Kieran don't forget your tickets to opening night. - Do you think I could get one more? - Yeah, no problem. - Thanks Ms. Doyle. - Never anticipate the fall Kieran, 'cause it'll only make the rising that much shorter. - Oh, you're definitely stabbing me harder now. - No, I'm not. - Yes you are. Are you enjoying this? - Maybe. You bleeding sadist. - Hold still, ya big baby. I'm almost done. There. Now we're matching. - I have something for you. - Oh yeah? - It's not much. Just a peace offering. It's a shite production really, so you don't have to come. - Kieran, I'm coming. I honestly thought I was already invited, so it's a bit of an insult. - Well, don't go ruining a nice moment. I've been meaning to tell you something. - Yeah. - I'm not a really good singer. So don't expect much. - Come off it. - Do you ever think about how crazy it is that no matter where we are on this earth, we're all on the same sky. - But in Australia it's night time. - Don't be a dick. I mean, we all look at the same moon and our days are lit by the same sun. - I never really thought about it. - When me mom left, I used to look up at the sky and wonder if she was looking too. Oi, wait up. Kieran. Kieran. - Egan please. - What the- - Egan. - What the fuck Kieran. I knew- I fucking knew, don't fucking touch me. - Please. I'm sorry. See this is why I didn't fucking tell you. I knew you'd fucking react this way. - No, you do not get to put this on me. I fucking trusted you. You didn't let me in. - Don't you think, I wish I wasn't like this? - It's got nothing to do with the way you are Kieran. - What? What? - You're a selfish piece of shit Kieran. - Oh, that's easy for you to say. That's easy for fucking you to say. If I was born, like you, I wouldn't have to deal with any of this. - Everyone's shit is fucked Kieran. But when you put that shit on someone else, it's all you. We were gonna go to London together. - We still can. - What are you going to do? Never take your shirt off? Did you even..? - Please Egan. Please. - I loved you. I love you, Egan. I love you. Egan I love you. Egan, please. Fuck. Hey. I'm sorry that I hit you. It was fucked up. I understand, if you can't forgive me, I don't really deserve it anyway, but for what it's worth, I think that you would've made a better Billy than me. - Break a leg. - Yeah. You were wrong about me. I don't deserve this part. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's not a matter of deserving. You got this part because of who you are. - If you knew half the shite that I've done. - Who you are, has nothing to do with what you've done. Look, there's always gonna be bad things. They're always gonna happen and life of course, yes, it's gonna have its difficulties. But listen to me. The measure of a true man, is in how he chooses to react and how he learns from his mistakes. And then if he grows, despite them. - But that time all I've run everyone off. - Seeking validation from others, without coming from yourself first is dangerous Kieran. Now look darling. I'm not gonna sugar coat it and tell you that it gets any easier, because it doesn't. But, we get better and handling it. - I don't think I can do it. - We can't control what anyone else does, okay? We only have control over our actions. So, we certainly can let the actions of others control what we do. Look. Darling, the world has dealt you your cards and now it's only up to you and how you are gonna play them. - Are you a balletomane, Mr. Elliot? - I beg your pardon? - Are you a fan of the ballet? - Well, I wouldn't exactly say I was an expert, or anything. - Well, you do realize that our students are expected to attain the highest standard of work? Not only in ballet, but also in their ordinary academic work. In order for a child to succeed, they must have the 100% support of their family. Now you are 100% behind Billy are you not? - Well, yes, of course. - Hey. You know, when you see a kid who's so unabashedly themselves? Pressure to fit in, hasn't hasn't caught up with them yet. I haven't been myself in a long time. I wake up every morning, wishing I was someone else and then I dress up and pretend to be someone else that, I'm not. I'm still chasing that kid and, he's in there, somewhere. Between Kay and Kieran. - I still love you. - I love you. You mean so much to me. I don't want to ever hurt you again, but, I can't promise that to you right now. - This is for you. It's called a "A Dark Boy". Actually, now that I'm looking at this light, I think it needs one more thing. Will you hold it up for me? Flip it the other way and as far away from your face as you can, right? Right, one last thing and, there, much better. - Feeling nervous? - Anxious, to get on with it. - Well, don't forget me when you're rich and famous. What? - I haven't even gotten in yet. - You're a shoe in. - I'll see. Here. - Thank you. - He'd be very proud of you. - Fucking sucks that he's not here. - You know what? It really does fucking suck. - That selfish arsehole should have just listened to me. - Well, you know what he was like. - Yeah. - Remember the time we were building the stone wall and he refused to wear the steel capped boots and the third stone he was carrying dropped it right- - Ahhh, Ahhh, Ahhh - Hi. I'm Julian. - Kieran. - Is it your first time auditioning? - Yeah. - I could tell, I auditioned for the first time last year and I was shaking exactly like you. - Is it that's obvious? - Yeah. But don't worry, it's not that bad. They're all bit stuffy in there, but they let you down easy. - Ms. Henley you're up. And Ms. Dearg you're next. - Actually, it's Mr. Dearg. - I am so sorry, I will get that fixed immediately. - I guess prestige doesn't include proper record keeping. After this, I'm meeting up with a couple of pals, a few blocks over at the pub. You should join us. - Yeah? - Yeah, totally. They'd love to meet you and we could show you around. - I would love that, yeah. - Mr. Dearg they're ready for you. - Kieran Dearg is it? - Yes. - You're from Dublin? - About an hour out. - Not too bad of a flight then? - No, not bad at all. - So, Kieran. What do you have prepared for us today? - The Son's Funeral monologue from "Metaphor of a Metamorphosis". - Alright. Whenever you're ready. - I'm honored to speak here today and to celebrate the life of, I'm honored to be free. I'm honored because her death is my permission to heal. She spent my whole life trying to convince me that I needed her, but it was she who needed me. And the fact that she abandons me the time when I need her most is, it's fitting. After I stuck around for all these years. It's fitting. When a bird is freed from its cage, the constraints linger. Most people can't tell but, a watchful eye can see, when a free bird has just learned to fly. ♪ You look just like her ♪ ♪ And sometimes when we talk ♪ ♪ I pretend she's standing right there ♪ ♪ And in your face ♪ ♪ Reminders of grace ♪ ♪ As much a part ♪ ♪ Of who you are ♪ ♪ When you have a secret ♪ ♪ Who do you tell? ♪ ♪ Cos she was our confidant ♪ ♪ Now that's she gone ♪ ♪ Who can we count on? ♪ ♪ Don't be afraid ♪ ♪ I know you well ♪ ♪ Please know there's parts of me ♪ ♪ That I have never said outloud ♪ ♪ But you know them quietly ♪ ♪ And I hope that someday ♪ ♪ You'll be proud of me ♪ ♪ In the evenings you become mine ♪ ♪ At least for another week I'm by your side ♪ ♪ Restless silence ♪ ♪ What's on your mind ♪ ♪ Let me understand just who you were ♪ ♪ Before I'm gone ♪ ♪ I turn toward you ♪ ♪ Let me inside ♪ ♪ Tell me all the things I never knew ♪ ♪ You had to hide ♪ ♪ For tomorrow I'll become a man♪ ♪ Away from your eyes ♪ ♪ You carry my suitcase ♪ ♪ You tell me I'll be late ♪ ♪ But I have a visit to pay ♪ ♪ Tears in your eyes ♪ ♪ You start to confide ♪ ♪ But I can't hear you from inside ♪ ♪ What did you have ♪ ♪ To say ♪
