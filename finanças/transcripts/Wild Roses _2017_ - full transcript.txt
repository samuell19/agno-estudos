I'm sorry, I missed my bus. Miss, come in first, please. Hello! The door is broken! Hello! Open the door! The fucking door is broken! Hello! Hello! Open the door! Hello, miss! Hello, excuse me! Hello! You forgot your bag. Here you are. WILD ROSES Eat this. Let me feed him. You'll take your time. Come, come. Or you lie down and take some rest... Mom, I'll take him. Come my dear, come. Turn the TV off. She does whatever she wants. Mom, let her watch. Why this is bothering you? She could have asked. Grzesiek is all set. Marysia, come back. Don't be silly, will you do that all day long? Please... You are disgusting. Can you hear me? I'd rather you died in this hospital. Don't talk to me this way, OK? Why do I have such crappy, disgusting parents! Why were you away for so long? Marysia, calm down, please. Don't talk this way, you'll frighten him. Put him in the pram and let's go home. Can you do what I say at least once, please! Who's awake? Hi! Did you sleep well? Ewa! Ewa! Are you there? Ewa? Mom, why? Get up. Put this on, nobody will see. One more minute. We are leaving soon. Grzesiek is waiting outside. Can you hear me? Wake up. Try it on. I'll be more at peace. I can't make it, mom... What do you mean you can't make it? Try it on. You hear me? Try it on. I want to go too! Mum promised this to me! Don't scream, you will wake up Jas. Go back to bed. Then why did you tell me I could go, huh? - I want to go! - It is a long way. You'll get tired. You wanted to run away from me, you old cow! Go back to mom, go home. Marysia, listen to me. You will get tired. - No. - Darling... - No! I want to go! - Wait... - You promised this to me! - Darling... But you promised! - OK, you'll go, just stop screaming... - Why? Why do you always give in? - Come, get dressed. - She'll be tormenting me... Hi... what is it? Headphones. - Daddy! - Don't scream. He can't hear you. Daddy, look! Daddy! Daddy! Mom, mom, come on! See how fat daddy is! - Watch it, clever girl, or no presents! - Come, come now. Hi Bambosh, old pal. He doesn't like you anymore. Hi. OK, I'll be going now. - Are you hungry? - Maybe a little... - It's cold, go back inside. - Let me take something. No, I'll handle it, go home. Bambosh, you little bastard. Old pal. - Did you dye your hair? - Yes. - Why did you wake him up? - I haven't seen him for so long. He looks exactly like my father, he makes faces like him. Daddy, where is the present? I forgot to buy it. Sorry my princess. Sorry. Come to me Jas. Take the toy and come to me. - OK, I'll be going. - No, Grzesiek. Stay and eat something. Sit down neighbor and tell me the village gossips. Will you show it to me at last... Wow! Awesome! Give me a kiss then. - Shall we put it on? - Of course. OK, and now the other leg... Now you look like a princess. Like a real princess. Turn around. Those waves make it even more beautiful. - Thanks daddy. Look. - Yes, beautiful. Marysia, let's go to sleep. I want to be with daddy. I will come to you in a minute, OK? Good night. Good night. By turns: one girl, one boy. Parents please follow your kids. Stop talking. Listen. Girls, please, let's rehearse the psalm. Miss Ania, please. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures; The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He leads me beside the still waters... What happened, Marysia? He restores my soul... You made a mistake? Keep on singing. You don't know the lyrics? Do you want the lyrics? Shall I pass you the lyrics? Why you didn't learned it? You had time to do it. Marysia, tell me, why you didn't learn it? What's going on with you? I shall not want. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... Hi! Hi! So, Marek, do you want me to arrange the job for you or not? Baska said that if I left even for a week then she'd file for divorce. Marysia. Marysia, come. Marysia, let's go home. Marcel! Are you crazy? Andrzej will be back soon. He won't. I saw that he'd gone to Marek's. They all went there. They'll play Playstation. So you know he won't be back soon. - Please, don't come here any more. - Did he find out? - Marcel, go away. - Can't you just tell me what you did? - You're still a child. - Let me in! - I love you. - Quiet! Go away. - Let me in! - No, go away. I love you, let me in. You hear me? Let me in! Andrzej, please. Come on, don't you want it? Why? Andrzej, please. Come, Marysia, you go first, don't be scared. You can start. A mortal sin probably... I don't love my parents. I imagine I talk to them, play with them, but they are not real... What kind of nonsense is this? It's not even a sin! Have you prepared something else? - No. - So? What do you say? I don't remember any more sins. I sincerely regret them and ask you Father for repentance... For absolution and repentance. You haven't quite learned it. But it's alright, there's a big queue already. Go in peace. Marysia! You forgot about something. Go away. Why are you looking at me like that? You don't understand what I'm saying? Don't come near me, understand? Mom! - We're here! - Mom! Mom! Mom, here you are! - Did you have dinner? - A little. Grandma told me to bring it to you. - Feed Jas, I'll pick some roses. - I don't want to sit here! - Is dad waiting for you? - No. He gave me a lift until the bend and then drove off. Well, you can't come back on your own, no way. I don't want to sit here! Can I go with you? No. Hi. - Mom? - What? Your illness... - it won't come back? - No. Is this what they told you in the hospital? Yes. But you don't look well. Dad is not going to catch it from you? Do you remember what you promised me? Yes. What? Not to upset daddy and not tell him anything. Promise? Yes! But just in case, we learned at school all those emergency numbers: 999... 997. But I'm healthy now, Marysia. - Daddy told you he would come? - Yes. Stop it. Let's go. Daddy, can I skip the school tomorrow? Get in the car. Easy... Come, come Jas. Jas... Make him stop crying. It's OK, Jas. How long have you been at this hospital? I told you over the phone. And you left the kids with your mother for so long? You know how she screams at Marysia. - What? - Andrzej, what was I supposed to do? Have you got any papers from the hospital? - Yeah, it must be somewhere. - I want to see it then. OK. I want to see it now. OK, I'll look for it. Marysia, come here. Julia, please, here... a bit more to the back, make some room. Mum, why didn't you buy me a regular wreath? - But you look beautiful... - But everyone is laughing at me. You look wonderful, really. - I'm going to the confession. And you? - No, I don't. Mom? What? I didn't want to say it with daddy around, but I don't want the communion. What is it anyway? What are you talking about? Anyway, I didn't tell the priest all of my sins. - What kind of sins do you have, child? - Terrible. You don't want to know, mom. Don't laugh. God may punish me for that. Go inside. I'll wait here for a moment. It will pass soon. You can fuck everything up. I thought, at least the communion would be normal. But you can even fuck this up. I'm fine, Andrzej. Go inside. Andrzej, go inside, Marysia is crying. I'll take care of everything. Nothing happens by accident. These are all signs. What are you talking about? Easy. You have to think about it, pray. What? Ewa, why you are not telling me anything. Yesterday I heard Andrzej speaking with Marek. I'm sure everything will turn out alright between you two. Basia, did you tell him anything? No, but he asked what people are saying. And what did you tell him? Just that people saw you with this boy and that's why these rumors started, that you were pregnant. Couldn't you just shut up? Ewa, why are you talking to me like that? I never said a bad word about you. People talk, Andrzej would hear about it anyway. Ewa, what are you doing? Where are you going? I will give you a lift, we can go back home together. Body of Christ. Your mother was a whore, and you are too. How dare you, aren't you ashamed? He is still a child, after all. Do you want me to go to the police? You'll see, I'll tell your husband, if he doesn't know yet. I don't care. I am telling you fuck off of my child! Take care of yours! You must have drowned him, you whore. Leave my kid alone, he has to finish school. Got it? You have children yourself, you stupid cunt! Girls, don't run, don't run! Marysia, all the best, stay as beautiful as you are today. All the best, here is something... -Can I help? -No. Thank you. -...from your uncle, congratulations. All the best. All the best. This is a gift from all of us. A lot of luck. - What are you doing? - I don't want this! - I was supposed to get another present. - Hey, Marysia. - Apologize to your grandmother. - I was supposed to get a computer. -Don't make a show, at least today. -Appoligize to grandma. -No. Help yourself, please. - Sit down at the table, please, welcome. - Give it to me, I will hang it. Sit down and eat, go ahead. Put something on and come, you'll sit there for a while... why let people talk? Listen... You have to be gentle with Andrzej. Mom, please. He will be away soon and everything will be fine then. Mom, please. It will be OK, you will see. You just have... to be gentle, like a woman with a man. You haven't done anything wrong. People do worst things. And they laugh, they live, they go to church. And you haven't done anything, you could have get rid of it. You weren't there, how can you know? I wasn't. I wasn't, but I know! Here's a towel. Get dressed. Just a minute. Marysia! - Come, Marysia. - No. She told everyone that I peed my pants. She laughed at me! - Marysia, no one laugh at you. Come. - She did. - No. - She did. - No. - Yes. - What have you done to mom? - What have I done? What is it? When you were gone it was different. - How was it? - Fun. - OK, let's go. - No. I don't wanna go! Leave me alone, you idiot! - Stop it, dad, it is not funny. - You little shrew. You are just a little shrew, like your mom. Uncle, me too! OK, alright. Calm down. One at a time. One at a time! Easy, one at a time. Ladies and gentlemen, let's take a photo. Mom! The parents with the child in the middle. Sir, a bit to your left. You sir please move forward. All smile and please don't move. And one... and two, and three. And one more. Don't move, everybody smile. And one... and two, and three. You shouldn't have come here. - You want me to go crazy. - Quiet. Stop it. Let me go. Stop it. Calm down. You're such a child. - What fucking child? - You are. What fucking child? Why do you keep saying that? - Because you are. - Why? Don't come here again. Jesus Christ, Jas is not there. - What do you mean: he is not there. - He slept here few minutes ago. He couldn't have gone far, we'll find him soon. - Go away, no one can see you here. - I'll help you. - Get the fuck out of here, I said! - I'll help you! How many times do I have to tell you not to follow me? Get the fuck out of here, now! Jas! Jas! Jas, mommy is here. Jas! Jas! Jas! Jas is missing. No. He disappeared like 10-15 minutes ago. I was picking up roses and... he was sleeping on the blanket. What? I am looking for him. He is not there. No. 10-15 minutes. OK. Jas! Ewa! Ewa! Ewa! Where have you been, woman? I was afraid that he has fallen into the water. The river is far away, how would he even get there? I don't know, I just thought that I don't know, Andrzej, how it could happened, I was here, picking up the roses and he was asleep in the stroller. Two hours. He always sleeps for two hours. I told you not to come to this fucking plantation. The few pennies you get there are not worth it. You understand? If we don't find him, I don't fucking know what I will do to you. Jas! Jas! Jas. Mom, mom? And what if Jas dies? We'll find him soon. I promise. Fuck! Jas. Jas! Jas! Go to the car. What have you done? What is wrong with your eyes? Stop it. It's not gonna help. You should have taken him with you when you were moving to another row. Shut up, It's your fault. - Go to the car. - Leave me alone. - You can do show, you can scream. - Leave me alone. Mom! Jas! Jas! Jas! Jas! Kamil, let's go back. - OK. What are you doing? Are you crazy? - I've got the feeling he's here. I will look for him near the ponds. I will find you later. - OK. Let's go back! Before it gets dark, we need to search this area again. Jas! Jas! Daddy will surely find him. He loves him very much. We love Jas very much too. But he loves Jas more than he loves you and me. Why are you saying that? If I were missing, he wouldn't worry at all. Jas! Don't worry, Ewa. We'll keep looking for him. Maybe you should wait by the road, in case he is found. No. I have to do something. I can't just sit there. Get up and look for him now. Call him and look for him. Keep looking for him, goddamn it! Call him, look for him! Let me go, Andrzej. Is there anything else you have to tell me beside this bullshit? Go ahead, go ahead. You are not here, Andrzej. - What? - You are not here, you just not here. Do you have any idea how it is to be here with two kids, with all of this? You come here for a week and then you are gone... You are not here, Andrzej. - What are you talking about? - You are just not here. Are you at least listening to what I'm saying? I work hard. For kids to have a normal house. - Is this all you want to tell me? - It makes me sick to look at this house. - Is this all you want to tell me? - I can't stand this house! Someone has to bring flashlights. Listen, we won't make it without the light. I have a few in my car. I can bring them. But everyone is exhausted now, I don't know, maybe we should wait for the police? Does it make any sense to continue the search anyway? Wait. Let's make a short break and think, what to do. It's too late... Jas! Jas! Come on, let's go, we can still look for him, there is still some light. - Let's go, fuck. I'm begging you. - Andrzej... It doesn't make sense. I don't know about you, but I will be looking for him all night long. Don't panic, we will reorganize and keep going. What fucking panic? Andrzej, calm down. We'll take care of it. Fuck, I'm begging you... We've got him! He has been found! OK folks, let's go back. He has been found! Let's go back, he's found! Pass it on to the others! We found him! Come in, come. I left him alone because the moment he sees me, he starts crying. And when I found him in the forest, he didn't cry at all, just kept walking and talking to himself. Thank God, I have a front light on my bike. If I missed him in the forest, I would have never forgiven myself. Oh God, God. Your mommy is here. See, your mommy is here. It's fine now. Little bunny. - Cheers! - Cheers! One day you will dance too! This is to Jas. You have to drink! Pour it, please. Man, you go to the shop and bring another one. Come here. You wanna light? Where are you going? - Leave me alone. - Why? - What the fuck? - Shut the fuck up. - Fuck of. - I said: shut the fuck up. What do you want? What? Come for a moment. Get the fuck out of here, everyone. Get the fuck out. I said, out! Fuck. Girl, why didn't you fasten your seat belts? - Are you hurt? - No. It's OK. But you got scared, right? There is nothing to be scared of. We're lucky. Could you drive me to this hospital, - next to the church. - Sure! - I don't remember now. - Sure, I can drive you there. Starts with a ''C''. But I know where the church is. I know where is the church. And the hospital. I'll take you there. Don't worry, everything is going to be alright. Excuse me, please wait a minute. Husband will bring everything, your mom will take care of you. You have to stay in the hospital. How can I help you? I gave birth in this hospital, and I want to take my baby back. I decided to leave him for adoption, but I changed my mind. Do you have your ID? Wait a minute, OK?
