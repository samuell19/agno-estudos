Move aside. 1 , 2, 3, cheese! Phone number and license plate. ID card. And the two girls? They don't have any. They're kids! speed it up! That one looks good. You look better because of the wig. - Let me try it on. - No! "Rooms 306 and 307." Who is it? Coming! The beers you ordered. The mid-term exam is coming up, start preparing for it now. Cut down TV and internet time. If you pulled down class average last time, I expect improvement! Class dismissed. Miss Meng Xiaowen! - Late again! - Get lost! You're late every day! Meng Xiaowen! Whose fault is it? Mine. she stayed at my place. I forgot to set the alarm. Your mom wasn't there again? Enough! Tell your mom to come and see me. As for you, You won't get into a good middle-school if you hang out with her. Miss, I'm sorry. I want a thousand-word self-criticism by tomorrow. And no copying from each other. Thank you, miss! Meng Xiaowen! Go clean the blackboard. Miss lazybones, late again! Bingbing gave me these. She takes them when she gets monthly cramps. Wen... Fatso posted our photo to the chat group. - Delete it! - Delete what? - You snuck a photo of me! - Did not! You posted it! I didn't. - No way! - Give it to me! Give it to me! sir, they're fighting! How dare you! She's taking my phone! Get up! It's not true! - she attacked me! - Enough! Back inside! Meng Xiaowen, get up! Xiaowen. Lily... 1 6 sheets and 1 9 towels. Make it 28 towels. Finish it. It's almost April. Why's it still so slow? Wait till you see high season! The beach will be packed and you have to work your ass off. Did you have fun at Jian's last night? What could be fun there? New earrings? Are they pretty? That tickles They look really nice on you. Jian is so good to you. He wouldn't spend money on me Jian asked me if you really are a virgin. If you are, he can find a guy willing to pay a lot for you. What did you tell him? I've no idea what you'd say. Come in. Over there. Take off your knickers. Get on the bed. Lie down. Closer to the edge. Don't move. Doctor... stay still. Don't be scared. Zhang Xinxin. Come in. Meng Xiaowen... Don't hit her! I'll discipline my child as I think fit. She's a kid! Who should I hit? You? Call up that bastard Commissioner Liu. I'll hit him instead! Calm down. We all need to calm down. Liu was your boss. You toadied up to him by asking him to be Xin's godfather. I hope it was worth it! How dare you say such a thing? It's the truth! What kind of a father are you, giving your own daughter to a monster like that? Watch what you're saying! I'm telling the truth! If you want to fight, take it outside. Parents, please come in. Wen, I'm sorry. I told my mom. she kept pressuring me. And you said it was my idea. I was afraid she'd beat me. Sorry... What's a hymen? Your name? Mia. Your ID? I lost it. Lost it or never had it? Inspector Wang! Don't scare my little sister. The inspector has some questions about the man who checked in with two girls the other night. What night? The night Jian came to see me, remember? I was on reception. You cleaned the rooms next day. Yes. Where were you that night? I was sweeping the yard. - So you saw them? - No. I was sweeping the backyard. Chief, there's no surveillance video more than two days old. Inspector, our system automatically records over itself every 48 hours. You should have come earlier. That's some crappy system. Time to upgrade. Upgrade? How would I pay for it? You have a prime site on the coast... No way. Look around, new motels popping up every month. You're new here? Yes, my name is Li. Don't bang on the wall! That's new wallpaper. It's spotless, not even a stray hair. Sure! We pride ourselves on our cleanliness. Did you find anything suspicious when you cleaned the room? Condoms? No. Any bloodstains or soiled tissues? Think carefully, don't lie to me. Empty beer cans? They ordered beer? It's in the record. Room 307, four beers. so? I think... - Yes. - How many? - Four. - Are you sure? Yes. Hurry! - That's very kind. - It's nothing. I put the fish in the trunk. It'll taste best steamed with fermented soy beans. Hey, you two! Did you find a blonde wig? - No. - Nope. Let's go Take care, Inspector. So long! Boss You two, squat down! Are you deaf? I want the truth. Who was on reception that night? Are you dumb too? If you won't talk, you're fired! I asked her to cover for me. You felt like a vacation? No, boss. I had a relative visiting. More lies? Boss... I promise I won't do it again. And you? Where's that Resident ID of yours? They're working on it in my hometown. It's been months, are you kidding me? You check clients' IDs but don't have one yourself? Lucky that young cop thinks more with his dick than his brain. You're laughing? You think I'm being funny? My makeup! Still worried about your makeup? You look like a whore with that makeup. Even trying to seduce a cop If you screw up again... As for you, come up with that ID soon or you're out of here! If anyone asks again, stick to your story. You were on reception, you cleaned the room. Get your stories straight. stop being stupid. It's a simple question. Where were you that night? Why does it matter? Of course it does. Were you waiting for her? Did you call her? What did she tell you? It all matters. She didn't come home. It has nothing to do with me. Maybe she didn't want to come home knowing you weren't here? You're saying this is my fault? - That's not what I meant. - What did you mean then? Here is the situation. Commissioner Liu won't admit that he entered Wen's room. The security video had been erased when the police got to the motel. The girls' injuries aren't enough to warrant an arrest. We need to find evidence that he entered their room. Every detail counts. I was out dancing that night. Got home at 2:00 am and went straight to sleep. So you had no contact with her until the school notified you? What about her father? That loser? He never sees her... Mia, Jian's spending the night here. Can you close up for me? So, you need an ID card? should've asked me. You can get me one? What did you do not to have one? Tell me. If you can't do it, just say so. Like there's anything I can't do. How much do you charge? Sweetie, it's vulgar to talk about money. Forget it, then. I'm kidding. 1 0,000 for an ID. New name, new date of birth. I don't have that kind of money. Of course. But money... is not the only way to pay. Alright. stop by my joint sometime. Tell us. Your friend Xin already admitted it. Tell him. I drank... a little... How much is a little? One can or two? The maid found four empty cans in the room. We can do a urine test to find out how much you drank. No test can detect alcohol after so long. Attorney Hao, don't interrupt my questioning. I was just stating a fact. No need to scare the child. Ms. Hao, please... I want to go to the toilet. Follow me. Inspector, My daughter is only 12, she doesn't drink. You'd be surprised what kids do these days. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. We're too old to keep up. - With what? - Inspector... I'd like to know why you're taking Wen's testimony for a second time? New evidence, so we need to interview her again. What new evidence? A few cans of beer? It's an important detail that she omitted to mention. It's not unusual to forget minor details after a major trauma. This isn't some minor detail. Are you doubting my daughter? That's not what I said. Do you suspect her of lying? You need to trust us. But do you trust us? My girl's injuries are clear as day. Why bring her in for more questioning? Why haven't you arrested that monster Commissioner Liu? To arrest someone, we need solid evidence. Kids can be such a handful. Let me watch her. OK. I'm taking Wen to my office. Join us. Don't be scared. It's just the two of us. I trust you, you have to trust me. We'll always tell each other the truth, OK? Tell me, why didn't you and Xin go home that night? We stayed out late singing karaoke. I was afraid Mom would beat me. Did Xin's godfather ever give you any gifts? Clothes or jewelry? Money? Had he taken you to a motel before? How many beers did you drink that night? But you girls did order the beers, right? Now, think carefully. Did you see anyone else besides the receptionist? This was her? Mia, where are you? In room 305. Where? Mia! What is it? Someone wants to see you. Who? The lawyer of those two girls wants to talk to the receptionist. Weren't you on reception that night? Be serious. she knows it wasn't me. She keeps bugging me about it. Find a place to hide. Don't let her see you. I know who you're looking for. But if you tell anyone, I'll lose my job. My number and address, I promise I won't tell anyone. Give me 1 00 yuan. I'll give you 50. I took Lily's shift that night. At around 1 1 , a man came with two girls and booked two rooms. One for him, one for them. That's all. I have more questions. OK, ask. How do you know the man went into a separate room? I saw it on the security camera. You were monitoring them? Not really. - Wasn't it odd? - Odd how? A car with local plates, no luggage and two underage girls? You get all sorts here. It wasn't that odd. And then? You saw him entering the girls' room? No. Did you hear any noise? Banging on the door, screaming? No. What about the beer? Right, the girls ordered some beers. Was the man in the room when you delivered the beers? No. Are you sure? Only the girls. What time did he leave? I'm off duty in the morning. - How old are you? - 1 8 You barely look 1 5. I am 1 8. Show me your ID. I've answered your questions. Call me if you think of anything else. Will you pay? You will be rewarded. If you tell anyone what I said, I'll deny it all. You still remember to come home. Did you run into anyone? Mrs. Li and Mr. Wang. Did Mrs. Li ask you anything? I told her you were sick. What did she say? Your dance group is learning a new routine. You'll catch up when you're better. You wish I really were sick, don't you? You look more... like your father everyday. Don't look at me like that. Look at yourself. What are you doing? You shouldn't be wearing stuff like this! It's not meant for you! Let go! And your hair... You don't look like a schoolgirl! Come here! Get inside! Dad! Look who's here! Come join us! - Get her a drink. - Give it back! Give me the wig back! Sit down. Lily, come. I'll introduce you to the boss. Boss Huang, this is Lily. Sit down. Have a drink with Boss Huang. Drink up! Finish the bottle! Give it back. scared you? Tell me where you got it, then I'll give it back. It's mine. Don't bullshit me. Everyone in town knows about that case at your motel. You were on duty that night. Does this wig belong to the girls? What did you see? Nothing. - What about the security video? - Erased. Yeah, right! I know your sneaky boss well... To run a motel by the sea, he must've greased a lot of palms. The last thing he wants is trouble. I'll bet he hid the security footage. If you can get it to me... What do you mean? Information. Information is money. Knowing something other people don't, it's money in the bank. You can forget about your penny-ante schemes. Get it? ls that enough? Call your mom in a bit. Tell her to pick you up. We agreed, one night and you go home. Why are you so difficult? If you won't call, I will. Where do you think you're going? Why won't you call her? Answer me! Do you sell SIM cards? sure. Real name or not-real-name? What? Real name, you need an ID. The other one costs more. Not-real-name. Regular number or lucky number? What's the difference? Regular costs 50. Lucky number starts at 1 00. Regular. Lily... What happened to your eye? Nothing. Was it because of me? Honestly? Nothing to do with you. Was it that Boss Huang? Didn't Jian protect you? Him? All he cares about is money. The cold will make the swelling go down. Go rest. I will cover for you. "I have a video of you entering the girls' room." "Give me 1 0,000 and I won't tell the cops." What took you so long? Open up. Quiet, she's sleeping. Open. - We agreed I'd take her home - Not really. What do you mean? Why did she run away? I don't have to explain anything to you. she wants to stay here. Using her to get back at me? It's her choice, not mine. I'm her legal guardian! - No need to shout. - Open this gate. If not, I'll call the police. Meng Tao! When did you start smoking? I quit. she really doesn't want to come home? What else did she tell you? The two of you... Equally tight-lipped. At the last stop of 28, change to... the 19 bus. - Come straight back after school. - I know. Move out of the way! Wen! Go away! Wen. - Wen! - Wen! It's alright, it's alright! Rest assured, we use the latest Nano-surgical techniques from South Korea. A perfect reconstruction of the hymen. It can fool any pre-marital exam. You can choose from these shapes. The round shape is the most popular. But the crescent shape is nice too, and absolutely painless. It takes only 30 minutes. Gimme another drink! Doctor said you shouldn't drink. Careful! The doctor said I can still have a baby. If I have a son, I will tell Jian it was his. He'd piss his pants! Just get inside. Fuck Jian... Fuck all this! I don't want to be reborn as a woman. Not all over again. Don't cry. Look, that's the sea. I can't see anything. Listen... You said the man wasn't in the room when you delivered the beers. Are you certain? Yes. The girl who took the beers was standing here? The door was half open? Yes. In this mirror, you can only see part of the room. How can you be sure he wasn't in here? He just wasn't. You're right. You're sure because you knew he was somewhere else. You saw him enter only later, didn't you? That's ridiculous. How many rooms do you clean every day? A dozen or so. And what are your other jobs here? Washing dishes, taking out the garbage, whatever no-one else wants to do. How much do you earn? ls that your business? At most 600 a month, I guess. And this room costs at least 700 a night. More than what you make in a month. You must feel that a girl who can stay in such a room would never need your help. You should go. Look at this... Take a good look at this girl. she ran away from home and she was found sleeping rough. Put yourself in her place. Imagine if that happened to you and no-one offered to help. That kind of thing would never happen to me. It's for Commissioner Liu. An urgent message from his office. Ok. I'm catching up with you! I won! - One more time! - OK. Meng Tao, give me a minute... Wen, I'll be right back. Boss, what is this? It's clear enough, a legal undertaking. I don't understand. Promise not to make irresponsible statements. The authorities are handling your daughter's case. An investigation takes time and Inspector Wang... ...isn't sitting around. When the paper interviewed me, I just said what happened. Do you know what really happened? Were you there? You want to take the risk of defaming someone? Me, defame someone? "All appeals regarding this case will be made only through the legal channels." I've done nothing illegal! Why should I sign this? I'm not signing it. stay right here, I warn you... Cause me no more trouble! I've already bent the rules by letting your daughter stay here. If you don't sign, I'll fire you. Boss... Your month's wages. Leave before the end of the month. - Why are you firing me? - You know why. I don't understand. Want me to play the security video? Room 307. She's a lawyer, she made me open the room. And then what? she just looked at the room and asked me some questions. But I didn't tell her anything. I swear. What do you want to do? shut me down? We're shut down now! Satisfied? You took the lawyer into 307 and a mob of idiots came to smash the place up, accusing me of withholding evidence. Why would I do that? In 20 years running this motel, I've seen it all! I'm going back home in two days. I've left a bag of things for you under the bed. You should apologize to the boss. Maybe he'll keep you on. No way. silly girl...You don't get it. If you stay, you'll have a chance to get promoted to receptionist. I don't have an ID. No chance of working reception. What time do you close? 1 9:30 What time is the trashed collected? At night... I guess. Wow, where does this go? The big funnel over there. The big funnel? I'll show you. Careful. Look, over there! It's huge! Fortune Primary is a private school A first-rate establishment. It opens the doors to high school and university. A private school? Yes, very expensive. But he should be the one paying for it. He must pay compensation for the harm he did to our children. We benefit nothing from him being thrown in jail. We need compensation instead. Hold on. Are you saying you want to settle? It's just an idea. We can discuss it. - I think... - Come on! Just tell him the truth. Commissioner Liu's gift to Wen. He says if we don't sue him, he'll pay our daughters' tuition. He was really drunk that night. He lost his head. He regrets it deeply. He would like... to make amends. What about justice? so what? A stint in jail and everything will be forgotten. While our daughters' reputations will be ruined for life. We must think for their sake. You're clumsy. It's too high. Meng Xiaowen! Zhang Xinxin! Let's see who is louder. Jian... What do you want? Where did you get it? None of your business, I want my ID. You stole it? I'm not touching stolen money. I didn't steal it! - So where did you get it? - 1 0,000 yuan. You promised to get my ID. How much? 1 0,000? Are you joking? 1 6,000 minimum. But you said 1 0,000. When did I say that? You know how many palms I have to grease? You tricked me! Darling... don't say that. I'm your big brother. Ma'am, can I borrow your cellphone? What for? I need to call home. I've paid the hospital For two more days. My business card? Look on the back. The video you want is on the computer in reception. That's the file name. I told you there'd be a reward. What do you want? You paid my hospital bill. We're even. You can't go back to the motel now. What do you plan to do? Go back home? You once asked me how old I was. Truth is, I don't know my date of birth. I only know... that I was born in the summer. This summer, I'll be sixteen. I ran away from home three years ago. I've lived in fifteen different places. I like it here. It's warm. Even a homeless person can get a good night's sleep. I have no place to go. I'm staying. Where did you get this footage? I can't tell you. I can guess. Did you watch it? Has Wen seen it? she has. And she's certain the man is Commissioner Liu? Yes. This is important evidence. so can you issue the arrest warrant? Sure. We'll need Wen to come in and authenticate the video. - see you then. - Ms. Hao... How long have you been a lawyer? Fifteen years. Why? Always this sort of case? Ever thought of doing something different? There are too many of "this sort of case". You're terrific. I really admire you. Time to go. Let's go. It's pretty here. This was all imported? No, all made in China. - When will the park be open? - On Children's Day. Aren't we going to the station to authenticate the video? Later. First we need a medical examination. We've called in the specialists. Why does she need another examination? The first one was rushed. It's just routine procedure. Get changed first. Wen... Over here. OK, relax. Dr. Zhao, your turn. Dr. Xu, please sign here. Today, we have asked three senior physicians from the Provincial Hospital to assist us with the case of March 28th by making a second examination of the two female students. Now Dr. Xu from the Provincial Hospital will announce their expert opinion. Binhai Police Forensic specialists, and gynecologists from the Provincial Hospital, an expert panel convened on April 1 8th, at 1 1 o'clock, having examined the two female students, conclude by confirming that they are Virgo intacto and show no evidence of sexual assault. The press conference is now over. - Thanks for coming. - No! You're lying! What kind of experts are you? Why are you lying? Why did you say they were lying? Wen... Mom says the doctors said we're both OK. Xin! see you at school. Remember, never keep the client waiting.
