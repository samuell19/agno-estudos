Oroslan? Hi. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. I don't know, I also don't feel well. What’s up? You all right? Fine, it's just a bit cold. Don’t whine about the cold. Your bones are still young. Shall we? I played football at Fazanerija in Murska Sobota and... - In Lendava. What’s the stadium called? - Nafta. - The stadium is called FC Nafta? - Yeah. So there. Then I played in Veržej, Beltinci and Turnišče. And I finished my football career in Turnišče. - What happened? - Huh? Just like that? At the time, I mean... I played for Domžale for the last six months, and for Olimpija's junior team before that, and then for a year in Medvode… So for the last six months I played in Domžale. And I remember saying to myself: "Fuck it, I either do something now or that's it." And I trained hard all summer long. And I felt things were going well. I thought the coach liked me and I was going to play. The first match of the season was in Turnišče. We drove there. We drove for two hours... How long is it from Domžale to Turnišče? - Yeah, two hours. For sure. - Two hours. It was boiling hot. So we get there and two hours before the match the coach calls us to the locker room to tell us the starting line-up. And he goes: one, two, three, four... Up to eleven, then twelve, reserve goalkeeper, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. I wasn’t among them, not even a reserve player. I mean… I wasn’t even allowed to put on the team jersey. I had to watch the match in my own clothes, like everyone else. - I was really pissed off. - I'd have turned around and gone home. Well, I bought some fags and stood behind that wire fence behind the goal. It was hot as hell. I lit a fag and thought to myself: "That’s it, goodbye." Did you have big aspirations or goals in football? You know how it is. When you’re a kid... When you’re a kid watching TV, imagining that you’ll… That you’ll play in front of 50,000 people at Marakana, Poljud, Maksimir... But in the end you play in Šmartno ob Paki, Zagorje, Velenje. - Turnišče. - Turnišče, Veržej... No, but… I mean it doesn't matter. There can be 30 thousand or 300 people, you still want to do it. - Yeah. - You still want to do it. So I was standing behind that fence, looking at the lovely grass you have in Prekmurje, and I didn’t even wish we'd lose. Usually, if you were a reserve, you wished your team would lose, so the coach would call you in for the next match… At that moment, I didn’t even wish we'd lose. I didn’t care. Not at all. But you still had to go back home with the team. I don’t remember. I remember partying for the next three years. There, in that pub, every day, a craftsman sat in the same spot. A blacksmith, who was a master of his craft and a master of life. And so we were chatting and I asked him: "Hi there, what's up? Have you come for a spritzer?" And he says: "Yeah. Every day, my wife lets me go for a spritzer." At the end of the long bar, there was this rather small man, who said: "Are you saying that you ask your wife if you can go for a spritzer? What kind of man are you?" The blacksmith looks at him, like this. We all knew something wasn’t right. Then he got up. He wasn’t fat. He was thin as paper. But so broad-chested that when he got up, a shadow fell on the pub. And he walked slowly towards him and slowly grabbed him by the ear, like this. And then he squeezed his ear so that the guy just went down. And then: "Ow-ow-ow." He turned him around and went towards the door with him. After every few steps, he squeezed his ear and the guy went: "Ow-ow-ow." Then out they went. We wondered: What now? Is he going to kill him? We followed him outside and saw him go up the road. And we went after him. He kept squeezing the guy's ear and the guy was going: "Ow-ow-ow." We walked past the cemetery... Will he throw him in a hole? No. We kept going and got to his smithy. Is he going to hammer him? And the guy went: "Ow-ow-ow." A bit further up was his house. We came up and he squeezed his ear. He said: "Vera! Veronika!" That’s his wife. "Vera!" She came down the hill with a basket full of autumn mushrooms and said: "What do you want, old man?" "Do I ask you every day if I can go for a spritzer?" "Yes, you ask me every day. Why are you asking me this?" So he squeezed a bit more and the guy went: "Ow!" He let go of his ear and said: "You see, blacksmith Jože doesn’t lie." And we went back to the pub. I buried Ilonka together with my brother. Twenty years ago. She told her family she was going to the cinema and never came back. The next day, they found her bicycle behind the pub. They said she either went across the border or into the water. Women used to prefer the water. Today, they prefer to hang themselves. And then… I don’t know, after a month or two she was found... In the river near the power plant, she got stuck at the dam. And so we knew she didn’t go across the border. She didn’t go across the border, but into the water. She had to be brought back home from the morgue. Her father Feri asked who'd go and get her. And my brother said: "I'll go. Just give me a van." Because he hadn’t been behind the wheel in a while. Feri arranged a van and I happened to be home for the holidays. And he said: "Somebody has to go with me. I can’t do it by myself." And so I went with him. We drove to town to get her. Then my brother suddenly hits the brakes, saying: "Wait a minute!" He ran into the butcher's, where he used to work, but not as a butcher. He just worked there. We used to do the slaughtering in the hills around there. He was used to this. So he ran into the butcher’s and brought out a sack, a plastic sack that they use for meat. He tied it on one side, we went to the morgue and we put Ilonka in it. She was a tiny girl, eighteen years old. We put her in and tied the sack to prevent the stink. And then we put her into the coffin. All that was left in the morgue was her clothes. You know, they, they took her clothes off like she was an ear of corn. You know when you open it up like this. And there, in her panties, there were two or three little poops. That’s all that was left of her. What about your brother? Eva was the last to see him. She visited him the day before. She went round to clean a bit, bring him food. She said he was poorly. But he was always like that, drinking seven days straight. He'd say he was better. Always the same story. Eva walked past our house the next day and she saw he hadn't taken the food he had delivered daily. She went to the pub and asked if they'd seen him. They said they hadn't. Then the pub owner Zavec sent Richy and Tommy to check on him. They returned and said he was lying on the floor. "And?" he asked. "Go back and check. Maybe it's not alcohol, but something else." When they came rushing back, they said he was stiff. Then the police, the doctor... He'd died. Then Eva brought the keys. She locked up the house. She brought the keys and... Yeah, that's that. I got back from fieldwork, like now, dropped off the gear and went down our long corridor, and, at some point, my phone rang in my pocket. I don’t know, but somehow I just knew it. The voice on the phone said: "Hello, sir, I’m calling from the Monošter police station." I knew he'd died, that he was gone. But, you know, there was something egoistic in me, I could've, I don’t know, I could've thought that he had hit his head, or broken his arm or leg, or something like that. But that didn’t enter my mind. I knew he'd died. And they told me: "Epilepsy: we found him dead in the kitchen." And the first thing I thought was that he hadn't hanged himself. They said: "Yes, he was lying in the kitchen. He suffocated." And again. He didn’t hang himself. Thank God. Nothing. I called his neighbour, Zavec the pub owner, who said: "Look, that’s how it is. You can't do anything now. That’s how it is." And I could just see them there, in the pub. Zavec behind the bar, and then Feri, Jančko, Atilla. They're sort of at a loss because they don’t know what to do. A moment before, they'd watched how they put him in a van in a transport coffin and drove him down the hill. The van stopped when it got to the main road, as if the deceased wanted to turn to the pub, where he'd been every day, and take his last farewell. But that’s not why it stopped. It stopped only to look left and right before turning onto the main road to Monošter. So then... I got there the next day and everything was the same as before. Zavec poured me a palinka or two, which I drank. I didn’t even go up to see how it was there. What could I see there? There's nothing to see. So nothing. We drank, talked. And yeah... That sort of thing. But, you know, you have to tell people… That a man has died. So my best friend Klenc and I got in a car and went to Monošter and other villages to tell people he'd died. We told Kruc, who's a strange man, a real oddball. And Irinka, we went to see Irena. I had to see her because Irena was, how can I put this, a woman who reminded me of my family, which was gone. She was a candidate to be my stepmother. She lived with my father for a while and... They might've married if I hadn't caused a scandal. I fucked it up, completely. When my father said he wanted to marry her, I lost it completely. But okay. They didn’t get married. My father never forgave me. Irena, on the other hand, kept jumping off the roof, trying to commit suicide. Her head buzzed, and she was in a retirement home and the psychiatric hospital, sort of going back and forth. Well, I couldn’t find Irinka. She wasn’t home. So we went back home. Zavec asked me: "Are you going to keep him in the morgue or in a room at home?" And I said: "At home. We’ll have him on a bier." And then we pulled out a long table, a village table, which can be used for anything. We play cards, slaughter pigs, have stag and hen nights, weddings, everything. And it's also for corpses. A neighbour came and put some cloths on it, and candlesticks, while I went to write the funeral speech. I wondered what to write. What? I could've come to his house from the fucking town and helped him. I could've given him 200 or 500 euros to fix the roof so it wouldn't leak, and to buy firewood and keep warm, I could’ve helped him. But I didn't, you know, I didn't. - Unnerstau. - Under... - Unnerstau. - Understand. No, without the 'd'. - Unnerstau. - Unnerstau. Thenk ye uncoly means... Uncoly means very much. - Unholy? - Or a lot. Uncoly. Shall we go? I'll follow you in a minute. Okay. Are you done for the day? Yeah. And you? Shall we? - See you. - Bye. Take the next right. There. Now go to the end. Keep going straight. And then left. All right... Now you can stop. - Or not. Let's go for a shot. - I’d rather not. Come on, you’ll see the waitress. No offence, but I’d rather not. - Really. - All right. - Take care, bye. - Take care, bye. I remember him as one of the best slaughterers in the village. He went to lots of places. To old people. And young people. He helped everyone. Whoever asked him to slaughter a pig, he'd do it. And he always did it well. He made blood and meat sausages, both really well. And he worked fast. He helped his friends for free and others for a piece of meat, but never for money, only for meat. Whatever they gave him. He'd always say: "It’s better to go to the pub than to church." In church, only the priest drinks, but here we all drink. I can’t say a bad word about him. He was really okay. It's a shame that he died. He was a good man. I liked him, and he was glad to have somebody visit him. I often asked him if he needed anything from town. So, some years ago, I came to his house to ask him if he needed anything. I opened every door, but he wasn't there. I went behind the house, and there he was, lying under an apple tree, sleeping. I tried to wake him up, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t tell whether he was sick, or drunk, or just sleeping. After a few minutes he opened his eyes, looked at me for quite a while and then asked: "Am I in heaven? Is this an angel in a white robe?" "Why, no, you're on earth and I'm your neighbour," I said. "I came to ask if you needed anything from town. I'm wearing white because it’s so hot." After that, he'd often say to me: "You're an angel that God sends to me when I'm in danger." We drove a load of spruce trees to Budapest. It was a week's work, and I must say it was quite hard work until we sold them all. He was a good man and hard-working, I must say. In addition, he.... Well, it wasn't just him, many people liked to have a drink. If we work, we have to drink. He was like that, he liked to drink. The problem was that when we were there together and I most needed his help, he'd often disappear. He knew that there was a pub nearby, he was thirsty. I had stuff to drink there, but he wasn’t so keen on tea. He preferred stronger stuff. All in all, it was cold, and you have to drink something to warm yourself up a bit. He certainly stuck to that. He'd disappear for a bit every day. Not a big deal really, but that’s how it was. I met him at The Cipher. He had epilepsy, bear in mind. He'd drink a decilitre of red wine, a decilitre of white wine and a decilitre of soda with a shot of vodka. I didn’t know he had epilepsy. And then once he had a fit. He fell on the floor, shaking. Some older people went over to him and pulled his tongue out. I didn't know. I watched and froze. I watched in amazement. Two minutes later, he gets up, walks over to the bar and just continues. I ask him: "What's this? Do you remember anything?" "Something happened!" He says: "Nothing." Okay then. In the morning, when we took the bus to work, the bus was full. When we got on, it was already completely full. We were all tired and half asleep, but by the time we arrived in Monošter, we were all awake because he'd say crazy stuff and we'd all laugh. Often, we couldn’t hear him, but because everyone laughed, we also laughed. When we got to Monošter, we were all awake and went to work in such good spirits, as if we weren't going to work at all. Because he talked and mumbled such crazy stuff. Sometimes, we didn’t even know what he wanted to say. When we met him and talked, he'd always look at our palms. Because he'd read our future. He'd say: "You'll have this, you'll have that..." "You’ll meet with a misfortune…" Where he got or didn’t get those ideas… In the end, it always came true. And then you thought: "His words actually came true. How did he know that?" He was a good man, he did crazy stuff, whether he told the truth or not doesn't matter. He was a very brave man and he made us laugh. Yes, well, that’s how it was. And then winter came. Boys would wander around at night, doing all sorts of stuff. He had friends, and they took a cart apart and put it together again on the roof. We all just laughed at how a cart could get on the roof. We met when we were young and got together. I played accordion, he played guitar. So we played together. After that, what happened was that he had a beautiful girlfriend. He was in love and all that. I also had a few myself. But I had a different type. We went to Budapest, where he met another girl, who then came over here, and the two of them met and a fight broke out. That was a pain, because we had to keep them apart to prevent something bad from happening. All this was going on and we suffered a lot because we were still young. I’m older now, and there are no such problems. It’s May now and everything's all right. Yes, you know, she got married to another man. He was crazy not to have wed her, she would've made a good wife. His mother was still alive then and would've taught her what she didn't know. And he'd have someone in his old age. It wasn't like they imagined. God knows what her name was. What was her name? She was a hardworking girl. He was a fine man. Based on Zdravko Duša’s short story "And That’s Exactly How It Was”.
