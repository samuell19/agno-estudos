You're very nice. Are you married? - No. I'd rather be alone. I have too many faults. Do you live with your family? - I don't have a family. I live alone. My story is a drama. Let's change the subject. I'm very curious. My Father and brother died in an accident. I was two years old. Not long after that, my Mother had a stroke. She's been in a home for 30 years. Who took care of you when you were little? I had an angel. - Who was that? - One of my Mother's relatives. I don't know his name. He took care of us. I was sent to a boarding school. Run by nuns. When I was older a bank got in touch with me. Someone had set up an annuity for me I could pay for everything with it. Even my Mother's home. - You never met your benefactor? No. My only reference was the bank that sent me money. Ifl asked for the name, I was told that they weren't allowed to say. Enough about me. We wanted to talk about our work. My company sent me to get in touch with you. It's an honor for me to talk to you. You're a great journalist. One of the best there are. Sen. Stavros congratulates you on your success. He asked me to tell you that on December 15, he plans to give an exclusive interview And you're just telling me like that? - How else could I? - Are you joking? I wouldn't do that. The boss hasn't granted an interview in 30 years. You're in luck. He's arriving tonight at 8:30 in Rome. In his private jet. He asks that you be at the opera at 9:00. The instructions are no camera, no pictures and only 30 minutes. Not a second more. - I like you more by the minute. I'll need your press pass by 8 pm tomorrow. - I'll be on time. Right on time. How are you? This is the best day of my life. I've waited my whole life for this. Guess who I met? Stavros Mintas. Don't you feel well today? I wish you could be happy for me I love you, Mom. I would like to thank you for your great interest With over 30 million viewers, the Stavros Special program had the highest ratings of the year.None of the authors could have imagined that. Thank you very much. Tomorrow, "Fame and Success" will premier. It will be rung in with a benefit for a humanitarian cause. Stavros donated 13 million for rebuilding Kosovo. For two reasons, his arrival is a historical event. First: after 30 years in exile on an island he is once again in public. Second: after 50 years he is returning to his homeland. We are attempting to get an exclusive interview with him. We'll jump right into the second part of the Stavros Special. We would like to present the extraordinary life of one of the century's most fascinating men. Take a dip in the delicate freshness of Ranieri bubble bath. In 1950 I went to a movie production in Rome. They were looking for a woman with my looks ancl age to play Pauline Bonaparte I went to an agency and was selected from a group of 100 by an older agent. During casting I met Stavros. What do you think of her? She's perfect for Paulina Bonaparte. There is no one I hate more than her, but you know how to cast a role. Would you like to play the part of Paulina Bonaparte? Are you kidding? - No way. Do you have acting experience? - Don't worry. She does. Then you will play Paulina Bonaparte. My brother means everything to me No one can come between us. _ Cut. The scene is done. - Are you joking? Monica is supposed to be an actress? If everyone is like this, we can forget it. - I thought it was believable. I don't care what you think. I say she acts like a fish. I expect her to do the scene again. OK, agreed. Stavros couldn't stand Monica. He fought with the director during every scene. Do you like flowers? Unbelievable. So do I. At home, in the office. I need you. I never thought that you would be a nature lover. - You don't really know me. Don't go by first impressions. I'm not that bad. I was fascinated. He was so gentle. And sensitive. We had an affair that the press blew out of proportion. The food is good here. We should come here more often. Don't you think - lf you'd like. You didn't tell me that you were going to dinner with Paulina. Introduce us. Hans Helmut. Pleased to meet you. - The pleasure is mine. You are more beautiful than I thought. Am I intruding on the two of you? If I am, please excuse me. Have a nice evening. Goodbye. - Goodbye. How does he know about Paulina? - He is my business partner. He saw your picture in my office. - I didn't know you had a partner. Be happy. When you showed up Helmut was busy. Lucky you. Otherwise you would have met him. - Don't you like him? Let's change the topic. I'll tell you someday and then you'll understand. I thought Stavros' partner was attractive. Somehowl was afraid of him. Even though I was in love with Stavros. my subconscious compelled me to do something that I shouldn't have done. At the movie's premier reception Helmut was following me. He followed me around so much that it was embarrassing. We went behind a mirror so that we couldn't be seen You sexy thing. Do you think Stavros would want this? Suck him. You'll be playing more leading roles. You turn me on. Suck him hard. Stavros might have wanted to join in. A little threesome? I love your ass. No one's given it to you like this. I'll fuck you, you sexy thing. I'm going to cum in your face. You like that. You sexy thing. I don't know his name. He wanted to know how Stavros found out about us. Either someone told him or he sensed it. He reacted wildly. You made a fool out of me. I never want to see you again. Get out! You behaved like a whore. Go to a whorehouse. - I was devastated. I didn't have a job and had lost my love. Regretfully, I turned to Helmut. Even though the whole things was his fault. He threw me out. I had nothing. No money, No job. Help me. - Sorry. Your career is most likely over. I'm sure he doesn't want to work with you again. That was stupid of me. What should I do now? I have a boarding school run by nuns. The director quit because of poor health. I'll talk to the Mother Superior. I don't know if she'll listen to me. - I don't know anything about that. It's easy. You'll only be in charge of a few people. And you do what I want, no questions asked. OK? - What do you think? I don't understand. - You will, lf you don't do what I ask don't expect my help -I didn't understand that. I accepted his offer. The work didn't interest me. I had seen the glamorous world of movies. So it wasn't of great interest to work in a home in the middle of nowhere. But I had to survive. As you know I used to be an actress. It was different than what we have here, of course. But I will do my best. Think of me as a friend not as your director. Please, trust me. This doesn't mean that you can break the rules. You're not here because you want to be but because the law put you here. To good cooperation. Soon I understood what Helmut meant. All the young girls were forced into prostitution. Helmut controlled them and I became his accomplice. I had to follow his orders. Ifl defended myself I would have lost the job. Once I had to bring the girls to a sheik. They had to do everything he wanted. Here are the girls. - The sheik is waiting. The first time with the sheik was awful for me and the girls. Whatever Helmut wanted we had to do right away. Screw me. Look in my eyes. Don't stop. Take him in your mouth. A wonderful slip-and-slide, That's some piece. What do you think of Asians? Sit on me. Move. Rhythmically. It's great to fuck a virgin. You'll remember this for a long time. I'll rock you. It went on that way for a few months. Until a guard told me something. This isn't a brothel. You were seen sneaking out of the house at night. You're never to do that again. Understand?! One day the police arrived and accused me of prostituting the girls. One of the girls and Helmut's chauffeur had reported me. The home was closed. I got two years probation. Stavros was acquitted. I testified on his behalf. That was the end of my story. Prosecco Salieri - for the best hours of the day. I met Stavros in the late 30's. He was working as a stablehand. He was handsome and good-natured. But very poor. I was totally in love with him I did everything to get his attention. He was engaged to my best friend and wanted nothing to do with me. What are you doing? - Working, what else? Do you want to go to the village festival with me? I can't. I have plans with Anna. We haven't seen each other in a long time. Maybe another time. I can't I have a lot to do. - Don't work too hard. How are you? - Fine. And yourself? - I can't complain. Are you going to the village festival? - Of course, I've been looking forward to it. See you tomorrow, then. Stavros went to the festival with Anna. He didn't even look at me. I was furious. I wanted to ruin the relationship. Shortly thereafter I got my chance. Can you do me a favor? - What is it? - Papa is worse. He needs medication urgently. But it costs over 800 Lira. The only one who could lend me money is Stavros" uncle. As collateral I gave him an old and valuable gold ring It was Mama's. It is much more valuable and very beautiful. Why don't you ask him yourself? - Because he's a pig. I once asked him for something and he tried to fondle me. If Stavros finds out, he'll kill me. - I'll go talk to him. What's up? - Anna asked me to ask you for a favor. Why doesn't she come herself? -Her father is very sick. She can't leave him alone. - What does she want? She needs medicine for her father. It costs 800 Lira on the black market. As collateral she can offer this valuable ring. - I've worked my whole life. I have no need forjewelry It's only as collateral. - What for? I've known Anna's family a long time. I'll never see that money again. lf she wants to borrow money, she knows what to do. You should help her. What did he say? - Do you have the ring? - Yes. How do you like it? It's beautiful, but it's not enough for him. He wants something else from you. What does the rat want? - Take a guess. - That dirty swine. Never. - Think about it. It's the only way. He's old. lf you do what I suggest nothing will happen to you. He'll forget his horny thoughts alright. - You would do that? What are good friends for? I met Stavros as if by accident. I pretended to confide in him what had happened the previous evening. I showed him the meeting place. So he would believe me and not run away. You're lying! - She's been having an affair with your uncle for ages. She's being paid for it. Now he doesn't want to anymore. lf she wants more money I have to join in. - That's impossible. You're making that up. Why are you looking at the ring? Come here and kiss me. Don't just stand there. I want to fuck you. I want to have some fun! You sexy thing. I'm all wet. The next day I came back to see if my plan had worked. I found the uncle's body. I understood how deeply hurt Stavros was. What had I done? - Help! Ever since, I've had a guilty conscience and been ashamed of the way I behaved. I never wanted to see my friend again. I kept my silence until today. I'm breaking my silence in order to cope with the pain. For fifty years it's bee locked deep inside me. The grapes of Asnieres produce a unique wine: Colmax. I met Stavros in the summer of 1939. I emigrated to France for political reasons. Shortly thereafter, World War ll broke out. The first time I met him was in a bus. Afterwards I wanted to be brought to the French border. We stopped for 20 minutes. Whoever wants to eat, follow me. It was fun to look at the ring. - I don't want to just make small talk. Leave me alone! - Leave me alone! You're imitating my voice. So you have a cigarette? I wanted to ask you the same thing. I don't even have money for bread. This could be fun. - You can say that again. We were both broke. We realized that we had to think of something. There were two people in the bus who looked wealthy. I had an idea. - What is it? - I have a source of money. Where? - Back there. I approached them with charm.The older one was the woman's father-in-law. She liked Stavros. I saw the loneliness in her eyes. Follow my finger. She looked to the right. To the left. To the right. You will fall into a deep sleep. Sleep. Deep and sound. In sleep there is peace. Sleep on. You are a good, serious man full of deep feelings. You love life. You really turn me on. You're good. Keep going. You have a sexy ass. You're so tight. You're so hard. - You ride well. You horny filly. - I want you deep inside me. You never had a stallion like me. That's how we got the money for the trip. We split up in France and met again years later in Rome. We was a movie producer and offered me a job as his secretary. I accepted. - Here is an appointment at 3:30 with Amerigo. It's about financing. We had a meeting with the bankers last week. I noted that. - Back then he was with a very beautiful woman. She was blind. Will you do me a favor? lf not, then start looking for a newjob. That's hard these days. - I won't refuse you anything. What's it for? - For Stavros. He's going away for a few days, I want to meet his wife. And you can supply the right tone. What does that mean? - You imitate Stavros' voice, I want to fuck his wife. -What? She can't see, but she's not stupid. She'll know immediately that something not right. I won't cheat on my friends. Neven - Do what I say, she won't know. Don't forget, half of the company belongs to me. I can fire you on the spot. Think about it. But fast, before it's too late. I understand. I'll do it. I didn't know how backstabbing Stavros' partner was. Even though I was aware of how he dealt with the extras. Lift your dress. I want to see what's beneath. Go on. Blow me. Lick it. Put some effort into it. Work harder if you want the role. You have a great pussy. But you don't move. Fuck me good. Look at my dick. I'll shove it into you and give it to you. You're so sexy. Rub your tits. Turn yourself on. I love your shaved cunt. You're so wet. You sexy thing with your sweet ass. I could fuck you for hours. We'll see what we'll do about the role. Can you feel me? Stavros left Rome for awhile. Helmut wanted my help to make his plan work. I'm back. - You scared me. Why are you back today? It wasn't my choice. - Come here, you're so far away. I have two people with me. - You didn't tell me that you were bringing company! I couldn't. Something happened. Something horrible. Stay calm. A man is holding a gun to my head. He wants to shoot me. - He what? - What do they want? I wanted to take a break when they attacked me and stole my money. They ordered me to drive here. They've taken everything from the safe. - Then why don't they leave? They can have everything.- They already have everything. - What else do they want? Something else. - What?!? - I'm sorry. - What do you mean? Stay calm. A man is coming to you. - What does he want? Stay calm. They won't hesitate to kill us. Stay calm. Don't get excited. That's good. What does he want from me? - They'll kill us otherwise. - I can't. Impossible. What do you want from me? - lf you love me, then do it. They'll kill me otherwise. Let him sleep with you. Trust me. You'll get over it. I know it's difficult for you. It will be over fast. Let him sleep with you. Stop struggling. It won't be that bad. Let yourself go. He won't hurt you. No problem. You're doing that out of love for me. These people are evil and will do anything. Let him put his arms around you. Go along with it was best you can. It hurts me, but blow him. Keep going. It's horrible for me. That's good. - That's enough. Everyone makes mistakes. I made the worse one possible. When Stavros sees this, I can only say this. It was forty years ago. Forgive what I did then. Next time we will present the moment we've all been hoping for. He can contradict, agree with or fill in everything the interviewees have just said. If he wants to speak in front of the camera. Thank you for watching. I hope to see you next time. For the final installment of our program on the great Stavros. I'm Antonella Strato. Goodnight. Come in. Senora Strato would like to speak with you. Send her in. And don't disturb us. Please have a seat. You're very punctual. - I always am. You have a wonderful figure. How do you keep it? I watch what I eat. and enjoy dancing. I smoke a lot and have no time for any sports. When you have heart problems you'll find the time. That's nice. I have bad news. Does it have anything to do with the interview? - Yes. Stavros' company is distancing itself from one of the interviews The interview with Stavros' alleged former secretary. Evidence shows that he was. Prior to broadcast, I always check the background information. I don't want to argue. I've been given this assignment. The theft trick in the bus met with disapproval. As such the question of your accreditation now lies with me. What are you saying? - That I'm responsible for it. Then there should be no problems. -As I said, I'm very curious. I would like to satisfy my curiosity. Whatever you want, you will get. I would like to see you dance. I'm a journalist not a ballerina. Seeing as how you want something else from me, let me just tell you where you can stick the accreditation. Satisfy your curiosity with a whore who wants to do that sort of thing. Sen. Stavros would like to know whether Ms. Strato received her accreditation. She didn't come. - Try to get in touch with her. Do so. - I'll try and visit her today. Her mother received lovely roses. I don't know from whom. You get roses from a secret admirer. Maybe your world is better. I've been waiting for years for this. In the blink of an eye the jerk ruins everything. I won't be blackmailed. Not by anybody. - Go. - What did you say? Please go. Look at me while you're blowing me. You feel good. You're so moist. If you had missed that. Look at me when I'm fucking you. At first you resisted. Now you're letting yourself be fucked. - Give it to me. You like that don't you? - Yes. Are you Senora Strato? - Yes. - Then follow me. I found her. - Have her come in. Please come in, Senora Strato. A pleasure to meet you. Please have a seat. I'm happy that you're here. - It's an honor. This meeting has cost you dearly. I had that man fired. I would like to offer my apology. Not even I can change the world. Would you like a drink? - No. - Relax. We only have a half an hour. - May I take notes? Of course. - Why did you leave your country at the beginning of World War ll? A spontaneous decision. Because of a love I will never forget. Have you ever been in love? - My Mother is the only one. You would do anything for her, wouldn't you? I never had a family. I placed my hope in the hands of a woman. In 1915, my parents emigrated from Greece to Italy. 4 years later I was born. Often there was nothing to eat. My parents died of tuberculosis when I was 8. My brother raised me like a slave. I met Anna when I was 20. She gave me the love I was missing. But life chose a different path. Don't look at the ring. Kiss me. I killed my uncle. He was the leader of the Fascists. That was my death certificate. I fled to France. My secretary already told you that. I took any job I could. In 1940 war broke out. The nazis marched into Paris and ljoined the Résistance. I had nothing to lose. Germany was allied with Italy. I would have been executed for murdering my uncle. I fought for a just cause. We were supposed to stop a convoy. And my life took a turn. Don't tell a soul. No one must find out. - Today the gold is worth 2 billion Lira. We agreed to hide the chest. After the war we wanted to dig it up. My friend was shot and died. After the war I took the gold and became a movie producer. Sen. Helmut is here. - Send him in. Hello. - Hello. Please have a seat. - Thank you. What can I do for you? - You're a survivor of the partisan group "Verona." You're the only one who is wealthy. The others are dirt poor. How do you know "Verona"? - I was a soldier in Normandy. It was my mission to bring stolen art to Germany. We were attacked by "Verona". I was taken prisoner. Part of the cargo was lost. And? That happens in war. Even war has rules. The cargo remained lost. It was handed over to the commanders. - Yes, General Karl Williams. A chest with gold bars was missing. I don't know what you want. Get out of my office. As you wish. But I have the shipping papers. The French authorities are still looking for the gold. The tax office would also like to know how it is you're so wealthy. And the murder you committed? - What do you want from me? I don't want money. You're a good businessman. 50 percent would be fair, don't you think? That's how he entered my life. After the war, did you see your sweetheart again? In 1960 I returned to my homeland a wealthy man. I wanted to see her again. We met at the village square. 20 years had passed as if they had been a day. Much had changed. - I love you like I did the day we met. You left. I was alone. My life is different than it was. I have a family. - What about our plans? Our love can't be over. I still love you. - I brought you something. Take it. No one can take it away from you. She gave birth to my daughter. Her husband thought he was the father. It was supposed to remain a secret. But it didn't work out that way. I said that I had nothing to do with it. Take the ring. You're a pig. - It was an error ofjustice. I'll explain. Get out of my life! She read about the scandal at home. I had to accept his crimes. I don't forgive him for destroying my relationship with Anna. I withdrew and thought only of my business. I'm the wealthiest man in the world But money is no substitute for happiness. Did you ever see your daughter? - She has become quite famous. I see her on television. - And the woman you loved? Who I love. Fate was unkind to her. Her husband and oldest son were killed in an accident.. Shortly thereafter she had a stroke. She's an invalid. Why didn't you ever visit her? - I wanted to see her as she once was. I have always taken care of her and our daughter. - I know. Your mother is seriously ill. Will you do me a favor? Sure. Give this to her. This will make her very happy. Don't cry. Life isn't always sad. Be more optimistic. You won't ever regret it. Someone told me yesterday that I should give you this. He always loved you and will never forget you.
