You had mentioned that the company you represent is interested in the northgate area. Yeah, northgate. I'm crazy about malls. I really think that that's where america is headed. You know, the convenience of it all. Where else can you go get a designer haircut and a brand-new pair of bowling shoes all within 30 feet? I don't think I've ever heard of your company before. Are you new to the area? Yeah, we're, uh... Actually, we're just a small company. Kind of a family-run operation, you might say. This is great. You know, it's really amazing how all of these small pieces fit together. Uh, Mr. D'arcy, that's very fragile. You know, it's a shame that things in life don't fit together so neatly.

I mean, being in the right place at the right time? You know, one man has a nice family, a nice home, another man ends up spending half his life in jail. You ever think about that?

Yes. Look, Mr. D'arcy, the point is we're not getting any work done here. No, you're right. Here we are wasting time when we've got a mall to build, we got yogurt stands to erect, burgers to fry...

Ha ha ha! Drew, I want you out of this house. Now! Well, how do you stand on this, John? I don't know who you are or what you want, and frankly, I don't give a shit. I just want you out of my house. I thought we could have been civilized about this. No, that we cannot be. You know what it was like, Diana? Hmm? Not knowing where you were, what happened to you? I mean, if you died, at least then it would be over. But not knowing and having all the time in the world to think about it... Some things are lower than bottom. Look, I want you out of my house. Okay, I guess it wasn't such a good idea coming here. But I figured, hey, what the fuck, it's the '90s, right? I even brought my current. Get up to your room. But faith was showing-- I said go to your room. I want the two of you out of here or I'm calling the police. And I don't want to see you here ever again. You embarrassed me back there, man.

Fucking touch me again, and I'll rip your heart out and show it to you before you die. Look, I'm trying to find something I lost. Can't you understand that? There's a missed step, a broken vow, in everybody's life, a point where things could have gone one way or another. I only want what's mine. What can she do for you that I can't, baby? I can be anybody you want. Mmm...just close your eyes. I can be your virgin... I can be your first love. Just close your eyes, baby. We all look alike in the dark. I was very young. I thought you could live life that way-- no tomorrows. I don't know, maybe I just did it to get back at my parents. There were crimes? No! No, not at first. There was just this crazy, romantic guy. You know, the secret dream at the center of every girl's heart, the man that comes out of nowhere with strong hands and no past-- a silhouette in black. My life was so controlled. He was the only thing that couldn'tbe controlled. And then he'd disappear for days at a time. One day there were all these cops all over the place. Hard lights, angry shouts... And I remember the way he was looking at me when they took him away. With that sly little smile and that soft voice... "This is only temporary, babe. You and me are till the end of the night." I don't remember what they were saying-- something about a gas station, accessory after the fact. They arrested you? Yeah. Yeah, I ended up in jail with these women with dead, empty eyes and I thought, "oh, my god, I'm one of them now, I've crossed the line and I can never go back." But a lawyer pushed a piece of paper in front of my face and said, "sign it and you can get out of here." Your father? Yeah, my father. Made a call, like usual, and, like usual, I accepted his offer. He made another call and I wasn't married anymore. It was like it never happened-- a kid's nightmare. Talk about your curveballs. John... You and the kids are the most important things in my life. From the moment I met you, I knew that you were something solid, something I could count on. You should have told me. I know, I know, and I tried, I don't know how many times. But I kept looking at you and I kept thinking, "I can't let anything blow this." So I just kept putting it off until I half-convinced myself that it never happened. It was wrong, I know that now. It wouldn't have mattered. You know? I've gotta go apologize to my daughter. Pimp: All right, man, you got somethin' for me? Don't hurt him, man, he's cool. Cool with my bitch, I see. Tell me, do you like the taste of free meat, man? He's running a tab, man, I was gonna catch up with you. Shut the fuck up, bitch! Easy with that piece, hoss. You better not be a cop, that's all I can say, man. You dig? Listen, take-- take what I owe you. I take what I want! [ Chuckles ] Stop it. Drew, stop it! Stop it--drew-- stop it! [ Groaning ] Drew, stop it! Get up in the room. I just did you a favor. Just promise me that you won't kill him. All right, I won't kill him. [ Pimp moaning ] [ Starts car ] Unh! What are you gonna do with him? I'm gonna take him down to the bus station, buy him a ticket, stick it in his hand, and let him figure it out from there.

To finally sell this place and build a home of our own. It's time to move-- I know that now more than ever. It's all behind US, honey. I should have told you. You had a right to know. Listen... What you did before you met me is your business. I only know the person you are now, and that's the person I love. I'll never bring it up again. [ Sighs ] Mel: Hi, Diana. Diana: Hello. As I told you, reverend and Mrs. Cleaver just needed another look at the house. Yes, of course. Now, about that electrical tower in your back yard-- it's really not that big. You'll get used to it in no time. Yes, we hardly notice it anymore. This house is just perfect for you. Well, if I didn't think it was right, we wouldn't be here. This is a quiet neighborhood? Oh, yes, it's practically boring. My husband has a heart condition. Oh...i see. [ Phone ringing ] I'll just be a minute. Why don't we have a look at the kitchen and the view? Ah, yes. These are really good people, hard-working, took excellent care of the place... Hello? Hi, honey. Just checking to see if Mel showed. Yes, they're here right now. Great. We are a heartbeat away from the new property. We need this so much right now. I know we do. Well, I'd better get back to the guided tour. Okay. Call me as soon as it's over. I will. Aàbye-bye. Bye. My wife just really loves that-- reverend cleaver? Is something wrong? There's a man parked on your lawn. [ Honking horn ] Drew: Diana! No... Diana! Yo! Diana? Come on out! Come on out or I'm coming in! I-I'm sure we'll get this all straightened out. Diana. What the hell are you doing here?! Are we having a party? I'm warning you, drew. I'm terribly sorry about this, reverend cleaver. Maybe we should-- did you say "cleaver"? [ Sternly ] Why, yes. I bet that came as one fucking hell of a surprise to Wally and the beav! Henry, maybe we should-- hey, are you really a preacher? 'Cause, you see, I'm in a desperate need of saving. Isn't that right, Diana? Hey, padre, you know about me and Diana? She tell you how we went before man and god and said those words? "Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, till death do US part." I got news for you, honey-- I ain't dead yet. Are you? Maybe that's it. Maybe you're just dead inside. Maybe the new hubby doesn't do it for you the way that I used to. Mel, call the police. Do you really think we need to? All right, Mel! Party animal! Get the hell out of my house and out of my life! Look, I, uh... Diana... Good day, miss Davenport. This is-- I mean-- Diana. Man: John, I'll tell ya, in this kind of structure, I'd suggest an amortization of-- [ intercom buzzes ] Yeah, Fran? Diana: Oh, Jesus, John! Diana, what is it? He came over here when the cleavers-- who came over there? Just come home! Oh, Christ! Diana! Diana, are you upstairs? Remember when I wanted to paint? Remember the plan? Have two kids, then go back to school for my m.F.A.? A neatly parceled life. I wasn't very good, was I? Yes, you were. You just stopped. Yeah. That happens. When we move, you can go back to school. No, don't say it. You know it'll never happen. Everyone's entitled to a mistake, aren't they? We'll work through this, honey. All I want is a normal life with normal desires. I'm never going to be a great painter, I'm never going to go back to school for my masters. I just want a little peace in my life. You know what he once told me? He said that the bond between US would never break until the day we died. And I thought that was romantic. What an idiot I was. No. No, no. You were young. What are we going to do, John? Look, this guy is a criminal, he's dangerous. Man: You said he hasn't actually broken into your house? No, he's just-- he keeps showing up. He is terrorizing my wife. Isn't there some law against harassment? It's a tricky area of the law. You need to get the court to Grant you a restraining-- all right, how long does that take? Could be done in a couple of weeks-- [ Hangs up ] TV: --Suffering from baldness, now you can spray on a full head of luxuriant hair [ phone rings ] Withscalp magic... Hello? This is Diana Davenport. [ Intercom buzzes ] Yeah, Fran? John, I've got that guy on the line for you. That weirdo from the other day. Want me to get rid of him? Put him on. Drew: John, hey. How are you doing? What the fuck do you want with my family? What makes you think that I want anything? Maybe I want to give you something, ever think of that? I've called the police. Oh, let me guess. There isn't shit they can do. They probably told you to take out a restraining order. Not bad for your average jailhouse lawyer, huh? Why don't you just get to the point? You see, John, sharing the same pussy binds US together in a special way. Don't tell me you never thought about it before, John, all the guys that have been there before you-- all the men that have seen her back arch, her eyes close, felt her hands reaching for their cocks. It's only natural. Does she tell you to fuck her harder, John? Does she scream it to god, or is she afraid to wake the kids? Does she still rise up off the bed like a bucking mare when she comes? Or is she a little too settled for that kind of riot? We've touched the same core, John. We share a secret. That makes US brothers of a sort. [ Chuckles ] Now try to imagine her from a prison cell. Eight by eight, cries in the night by some fresh meat being turned out. And all the while... All the while your wife's out there, eyes closing at the pressure of another man's cock. And there's not a fucking thing you can do about it. Don't you want to know what I know, John? [ Chuckles ] You didn't think she was a virgin, did you? Ha ha! [ Hangs up ] John, you're an architect, you build things. He's got a thing for dynamite. His game is control. If he can get to you, he wins. You keep your cool, sooner or later he's gonna screw up, he always does. He acts on pure impulse. Or am I telling you something you already know? You said you can arrest him. I can, on a parole violation. But I gotta find him first. I want to go with you when you do. This is not gonna be amateur night. Listen to me. This son of a bitch has threatened my family. John, don't do this. I want to be there. Well, we'll have to think about that, partner. Gotta find him first. This is personal for you, isn't it? Let's just say we go back a ways. We both owe him, Mrs. Davenport. [ Door opens, closes ] John, if you think this is some sort of macho game, you're going to lose. I know him. Diana, I will protect my family. I know, I understand what you're trying to do, but-- oh, my god! Oh, my god. What is it? He's in the house! Diana! Diana, will you listen to me?! Diana, calm down! Diana, I drank that beer. It was me. They were still in the refrigerator. He must have left them here the day of the barbecue. [ Gasping ] [ Glass breaking ] [ Groans ] [ Gasping ] Unh! Unh! Uhn! Unh! Uhn! Unh! What are you doing?! Damnit, Diana! What? What is it? They could have been killed. Jesus Christ, you and your goddamn... [ Sighs ] Myles: Why are going to grandma and grandpa's on a Tuesday? Marissa: Why won't anybody tell US anything? Come on, you guys. Who wants fresh brownies? Myles: I do. They can stay here as long as you feel necessary. Thanks, dad. I only hope that bastard-- dad. Look, I want you two to mind grandma and grandpa while you're here, okay? What about school? There won't be school for a few days, okay, buddy? Oh, boy. What are you and daddy so afraid of? Grandpa: Come on, Rita. Here, take this. Bye, sweetie. [ Phone ringing ] Hello? Garrett: Bingo. Tell me. He had a little boxing match with some prostitute over on the row. She put the word out on the street he's bad news. Well, where is he? A little fleabag over on 3rd called the starlight. Okay. I can be there in twenty minutes. This is his game, not ours. You don't have to prove anything to me. [ Sighs ] He's in room 17. Now, let's keep this simple. No cowboy bullshit, all right? You just back me up. Come on, it goes with the price of admission. Hey. You sure you can handle this, whatever goes down? Well, well, well. It I'd known it was girls night out, I woulda brought pretzels. [ Gasping ] Well, ain't that a bitch. You know, it's amazing how much one of those things looks like a gun in the dark. Is he dead? Yeah, I'd say so, yeah. Oh, Jesus. Hey, don't fade on me now, brother. Oh, Christ, you weren't supposed to shoot him. Hey. Don't play that with me. We both knew what this was about. No. No, I didn't come here to kill anybody. Oh, no? No? Listen, the only way this thing was gonna end up was with one of you dead. Now, he accepted that. Why can't you? Here. Now, I'll take care of things here. I'm gonna get his prints on it, say he drew down on me. A guy like that, nobody's gonna ask too many questions. You were never here. Run on home to your wife. Go on. Go ahead. Go on. It's over, man. It's gonna take some time. Mm-hmm. We have too much together. Yeah. If I ever thought-- no. Shh. You have nothing to apologize for. [ Floorboards creak ] Diana, he's dead. You can't get spooked every time this old house creaks. No, wait, wait. I thought I heard something. [ Banging on door ] [ Loud banging ] Police! Freeze! Get down on the ground! Don't move! Lace 'em up! Mr. Davenport, you are under arrest. Photographer: Face forward, asshole. Frank: Jeez, John, what in the hell were you doing in that motel room? I was set up, frank. Set up? By whom? A parole officer named Garrett hill. I don't know what kind of game he's playing, but-- parole officer? John, it was your fingerprints on the gun. Yeah, I was in the room, frank, but I didn't shoot anyone! Hey. Hey. I'm just a real estate lawyer. Look, frank, I know that. Come on, I need your help. Okay. Why don't you tell me what's going on here? Garrett hill killed drew d'arcy! Drew d'arcy? Who in the hell is drew d'arcy? He was Diana's first husband. The dead guy was married to Diana? Yes, frank, long before she met me. Something here doesn't make sense. What are you talking about? I mean, the stiff they've got is some skinny pimp from the strip named peaches Monroe.

What did you think when he told you that I was dead? Bonus points if you tell the truth. [ Ringing ] Come on, buddy, keep the line movin'. You didn't really think that it would be that simple, did you? In case you're wondering, he's not really a parole officer. But he did kill one once. The bonds of friendship formed inside of prison are really underrated. What do you want from me, drew? You made me a promise, Diana. I'm not that same person anymore. That's funny-- you look like the same person. I have a life now. You had a life with me! Please don't hurt my kids. Just think of Garrett as... Their guardian angel. So long as I'm okay... Then they're okay. Now... Let's go for a ride. Arghh! [ Footsteps approach ] [ Footsteps approach, keys jangling ] Let's get out of here, John.

Son of a bitch was only buying time. Diana! Diana! Easy, partner, you're gonna make me spill my French fries. You son of a bitch. You set me up! Don't take it personally. Just repaying an old buddy. Give me your gun. It's against policy, friend. [ Grunts ] All right, all right. So, uh, when'd you grow a second ball? You should have never involved my kids. Never. Lean forward. Lean forward! Unh! The buckle, the buckle! Whoa, that really cuts into you. Shut up and drive. Look, uh... It was never about the kids, okay? [ Starts car ] Soon as I got word that he was clear, I was goin'. Move. Get over there. So, you got a plan, hoss, or we just gonna wing it? Just get over there and take out your cuffs. My cuffs. Put it on your wrist. No, no, no, no-- right wrist. My right wrist. Now toss me the keys. Other end on the fence. Anywhere? Do it. [ Clears throat ] Okay, now tell me where he's taken her. You think he woulda told me? Gonna be an awful long night if he didn't. [ Sighs ] Look, he said something about the desert, like he's got a place out there or something. Come on, the desert's a big place. That's all he told me, man. Gee, that's too bad. Oh, fuck. One last chance. I don't know shit. Now, I'm gonna go to the cops and tell them where you are, and you better pray to god that my wife's okay. [ Starts car ] [ Sighs ] [ Talk radio on ] [ Turns radio off ] No. No, listen to me, frank. I know he's taken her. John, you're still not totally in the clear on that murder investigation. In 48 hours, they can take a missing persons report. 48 hours? Jesus Christ. He can cover three states in that time! All you've got is a tape of kids playing on a lawn and a guy handcuffed to a parking sign who says he doesn't know shit. Are you listening to me? Yeah, I'm listening to you. What are you planning to do? Keep me prisoner forever? That's an interesting word, "forever." It'll all come back to you, Diana. You can't be tamed any more than I can. I've changed, drew. Yeah? You've changed? Let's see how much. Hey, hop sing. These pork rinds come in spicy? We have wheat rinds in spicy. I didn't ask you if you had wheat rinds! Put your hands down. This ain't TV. I don't have any large bills. That's all right, I'm just trying to make a point. Honey, go get me a six-pack. Move, or I'll blow his fucking brains all over this wall. The tie that binds. Shit, he was tellin' the truth. Come on, let's go! I'm looking for faith. Well, honey, you've found hope. Look, this is an emergency. You don't look so hard up. Listen, I haven't got time to explain this to you. Now, please, I need to find this girl faith. I was told she works the streets around here. Who you figure killed Kennedy? What? You know, lone gunman or conspiracy? I don't know, lone gunman. Please, I need to find this girl. Try the carousel. It's over on 3rd. All comin' back to you? You just killed a man to prove something to me? No, I killed him because if I didn't, he woulda killed me. And that's the way you see it all, isn't it? Actually, yeah. You just take what you want, and then when somebody stands up to you, you--you think whatever happens to them is their responsibility. You think that's all I'm about? Huh? Taking things? You think this shit means anything to me? Huh? You think it's about the money? Huh? You think it's about the money?! [ Bills flutter ] Oh, is that supposed to impress me? Like threatening my kids? Your kids'll be fine. Old hubby'll be out of the joint as soon as they start putting the pieces together. He'll enjoy the single father routine. He's that house-husband type anyway, isn't he? [ Jukebox plays rock music ] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, damnit! I'm looking for a girl named faith. I heard she works around here. She might have been here. [ Bills rustling ] [ Bills rustling ] You're not a cop, are ya? No. She's, uh... Just down the hall, downstairs. You're faith, aren't you? For the right price I'll be whoever you want me to be. Jesus-- what did he do to you? Nothing that hasn't been done before. I need your help, faith. Hey...man. Do I know you? You came to my house with drew d'arcy. I'm John Davenport. Oh, yeah, right. I need your help, faith. He's taken my wife. Why don't you just fuck off, man? No. Why don't you just fuck off? Oh, man, we don't have to be doin' that. Listen to me, faith. He's threatened my children. He's kidnapped my wife. Yeah, you had a nice family. Right. Nice kids. I--i like kids. I need to find out where he's taken her. He never told me anything. Did he ever talk to you about a hideout, maybe somewhere out in the desert? The desert? Yeah. He talked about this place out past mountaincrest. Mountaincrest. Yeah. He said it was the world of the future. He said he could disappear into the desert like an Indian and become part of the sky and the sand. Look, are you gonna be all right? I always am. No, you--you don't-- you don't owe me anything. Here. Here. [ Crickets chirping ] Drew: I always knew I'd end up out here. He doesn't have the staying power, Diana. Oh, he'll try for a while, but he'll give up. You don't know him. I'm gonna take you deep into the disappearing place. To find you, he'd have to endure the heat of the midday sun, the cold of the deep night. He'd have to pass through fever sweats, like a warrior shaman. You think he'd do that for you, Diana? Do you know anybody but me with that level of...Commitment? He's not going to give up. He'll find you, and he'll kill you if he has to. Well... Then if he's willing to do all that, I guess he deserves to get you back. Now get the fuck in the car. [ Starts car ] Diana: What is this place? Drew: Well, they started building it back in the '50s, during the boom. You know, a prototype for some kind of levittown of the west. In the middle of nowhere? No, they were supposed to build a superhighway, cut right through the heart of these mountains. But, uh... I don't know, it was their idea of taming the wilderness. So what happened? A couple of men got killed during the first blast, so they had to reassess costs. The highway never happened, the idea died. An old man I met in stir told me about it. He was working the highway detail at the time. Come on, I want to show you somethin'. Now you can paint all you want. Don't tell me you didn't quit, Diana. You're drying up inside, living that tame life. Maybe I screwed up... But when we were together, you never doubted for a second that you were alive. When we were together, I was scared to death half the time. We're all scared inside. We're all scared, Diana. If we're not scared, we're not alive. Tell me you've forgotten the heat. I can't do that, drew. [ Siren blares ] I'm just taking a little rest, officer. Had a little shooting back in charro last night. Market holdup. A fellow who really likes to get on the TV. Sorry for the inconvenience. Could I see your drivers license and registration, please? No, I... Borrowed the car from a friend, I forgot to take the registration. Well, shouldn't do that. Considering the guy I got this car from, there's probably a warrant or a body attached. Friend, you better put that gun down. Somebody kidnapped my wife, and I'm the only chance she's got. I don't know if that's true or not, but-- toss me the keys to your car. I can't do that. [ Radiator hissing ] You are buying into a shitload more trouble than you got right now. Look, I'm real sorry about this, but I haven't got time to convince you I'm not the bad guy. So give me your gun. Give me your gun! Get 'em up! Give me the keys. Come on! [ Tire blows ] [ Revving engine ] [ Turns off motor ] Diana: So, this is the plan? The little woman tends to the homestead while you go out and Rob gas stations every now and then to pay for the canned goods? I just love chili in a can. You know, drew, you're right about one thing. For years I tried to convince myself that there was never anything between US-- that it was just a childhood thing, a little girl's attraction to the outlaw. But I really did love you once. And I don't need to keep making excuses for that. Did you ever think it might be the other way around? That you spend years putting on layers of bullshit till you lose sight of your own core? I know who I am, Diana. I never lost sight of that. Not since the first time I put a gun behind a man's ear and let him know that whether he lived or died had nothin' to do with him. All it had to do with was... How I happened to be feeling at that particular moment. Mmm, that's good stuff. Aah! [ Groans ] [ Groaning ] This is crazy, drew. There's a reason they didn't finish this house. Failure of will. You're a deep hunger for me, Diana. You always have been. Drew, don't. You alwayshave been. Tell me that part of it wasn't good between US. I don't have to tell you anything. No! Tell me how you want it. No! You can say it as loud as you like. No... Louder. No. Drew: That's my girl. [ Drew moaning softly ] And what are you planning on doing with that knife? [ Car starts in distance ] [ Tires squeal ] Oh, my god! Get the fuck away from him! Come on! Come on! Fucking pussy! So, John-boy, you are capable of a little surprise, aren't you? You wrecked my fuckin' house! So, how long were you out there, huh? If you'd stayed out there long enough, you mighta got the answer to that question of yours. I'm not gonna play this game with you. [ Chambers round in shotgun ] It's easy for you to judge me from your cold, dead heart of suburbia. But I wonder what would happen if you woke up some morning in a fucking jail cell, some stinking cell with a couple of niggers trying to turn you out?! Just lying there thinking to yourself, "god, if I ever got out of this place, I'd collect on every fucking debt." And then some morning that you hear out there somewhere is another man fucking your wife-- living your life, fucking your woman. She's my wife. She's your wife? Prove it! Come on! Get the fuck down here! Get on top of her. Come on. Get the fuck on top of her. Now! Get the fuck on top of her. Drew, don't! There we go. Come on, John. Let's go! Come on. There we go. Oh, god, will you-- this is one demon I'm gonna exorcise. What's the matter, John? Can't get it up? Get up. Get up. [ Groans ] Get up. Diana: Drew, wait a minute! I'll stay with you if that's what you want. You don't need to hurt him. [ Chuckles ] You listening to this, hoss? I'm gonna Bury you deeper than dead. Drew, you're crazy. Ha ha! I may be, but at least I know what's mine. Now move! Ohh! Ha ha ha! There's my girl. Easy now, partner. [ Chuckles ] Well, well, John. I see you found my little insurance policy. You're a crazy fuck. You'd rather die with her than give her up, wouldn't you? Yeah... But would you? [ Click, electronic humming ] [ Laughing ] Diana: How'd you know about this place? John: They all had bomb shelters back then. There you go. [ Coughing ]
