Ok girls, to get our silver objects shiny, first thing to do is to clean up the dust with a flannel or chamois Then, we can clean it with cotton soaked in sodium bicarbonate. Another excellent cleaner for silver is cigarette ash mixed with lemon juice. Yes, the ashes you would probably find in the house from your husbands, so you must to learn to collect them. Now, some important advice, we should never, never use abrasive products to clean silver objects because they would scratch irreparably. And the worst that could happen to our silver objects is that they get scratched. Understand? The abrasive products are those that are used to polish, like sand or aluminum but don't work on silver. So, girls, which are the products that we can't use to polish silver? Yes, Elisa? The abrasives like sand and aluminum. They can scratch the silver. Very good, Elisita, that's the worst that can happen. Excuse me! I told you... Here comes the dyke chic, what is she gonna do now? She is so weird! Disgusting. Amazing! What are you playing? It sounds beautiful. Nothing. You are so good, why don't you play like that in the music class? Nobody knows that you play. What do you want? Don't know. Talk. Clear up some things. What things? About the slug, for example, that was Agustina's idea. -I don't believe you. -I don't like those things, I find them stupid, I'm so sorry I did not do anything about it. Why do they bother you so much? Why do you let them to bother you, are you afraid to defend yourself? That would be make things bigger, at the end everything would be worse. I don't know, maybe if you were a little bit more kind, they would accept you as you are. Really? And how am I? A dyke? That is what they are saying about me behind my back, right? Is it because I don't care about the singers or about the boys of the french school? Or because I don't dress up or go to their ridiculous parties, that's enough to draw absurd conclusions? I haven't said that, and I don't care. all I want is to be your friend. I don't need your pity. I will finish high school in one semester, so the least I need is to have friends. All of you are morons. I better leave. My dad is in Europe but he promised me that when he is back we will go and ride horses at the place I told you about, remember? We can go. How cute... Elisita, excuse me, I don't want to ruin your things. I just want to be your friend. Come on! Smoke a cigarette with us, here. -I want to. -Nobody will find out, come on! -I don't smoke. -Just a little! Leave her alone. She says she doesn't want to smoke. Are you stupid? And all of you are stupid as well. You are so bitter, Rebeca! She will end up alone if she wants to protect ghetto girls, I don't want her here any more. No more! Thank you so much for what you did behind the church. Relax, it was nothing really, as I was tired of Agustina for a long time and I wanted her to take me off her stupid list. Of friends. And about what I said about being friends... it's not all true. I'm so happy to know that! Really. Now that I know your secret, I can tell you mine... I want to be an actress. Yes! I can picture you acting at the Municipal theater. Municipal theater? Mmmm, I don't know, I think I prefer films. I leave the theater to you, when you become an Orchestra performer. You will be the new Rosita Renard. If you could choose a place, where would you like to go? If I could choose, I would like to be near the sea. The sea is what I like the most in this life. Seriously, the ocean? Why? I don't know, because it's mysterious and deep and is where everything ends. You? Where would you like to be? Me? I think I like to be here, exactly where I am. Read after me. ”I have abandoned my lands and my fortune to come after you." “My intention was never to cause you misery, my love is real.” "My only misery would be that you wont love me then Kiss me my love." Relax, we can solve this together. Leave me alone! What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Leave her alone! Rebeca is not like you. ghetto and a dyke. Don't you see? She is crazy like her mother! Don't talk about my family! Mr. Traverso, due to your daughter's misbehavior, as a member of the church, I'm obligated to kick her out of the school. Forgive me Mother, but what I understood is that Elisa acted like that to save her integrity, in self-defense. It is very difficult to make this choice. Elisa is a brilliant student, she has always stood out, but I'm afraid that there is something more, Mr. Traverso. The group of girls that saw the incident, said that they saved Miss Subercaseaux of a dishonest attack. The girls said that Elisa had wrong intentions with Miss Subercaseaux. No! That is impossible. I refuse to believe that my daughter is capable to do something like that! I would like to leave everything clear. Students, please. I need you to tell Mr. Traverso all That happened. My Friends and I heard loud noises, desperate screams. Rebeca who was asking us to help. We got scared, we ran to see what was going on and when we got there. she was trying to touch her! It was horrible and Rebeca only wanted to defend herself. Ok, that's it. Is Miss Echaurren correct Miss Subercaseaux? Yes. How can you lie like this, Rebeca? Calm down. That's it students, you can leave. I understand your anger, Mr. Traverso to see yourself involved in this weird situation, and believe me when I tell you sincerely I feel bad for you about this situation. I suggest you to take Elisa, as soon as you can, to a priest who could guide her. I'm sure she'll be fine. Of course, it's all clear. You believe her because her father is a great benefactor of this school. You are nothing but corrupt nuns! Let's go! Look, look! Elisa is leaving. Do not shrug your shoulders daughter, walk with dignity, always with dignity. Girls! Inside Thank you to sticking up for me and believing in me. This school was your mother's choice, I never liked the nuns. I promise you that I will never let you to be treated that way. It is true? What? That you have “that”... you like women? I don't know. I think so, I have always felt like this. So you think there is a way to reverse it? Could you feel something for a man. have kids? I don't know, maybe. Well, enough talk, we'll get a good doctor in Valparaiso, a discreet one. And don't tell your mother anything, she woke up a little bit sensitive today, ok? OK? Ok Dad, it's ok. Enrique? Let's go on a vacation? No! Elsita did not feel good, nothing serious, she will continue the instruction at home. Good, good, I don't like this place. is full of gypsies. Yes. Elisita? Let's go on vacation to Laguna Verde? Good idea! Good idea.it's been a long time since we've been there. Remember when we were dating and used to go there? Well, let's go then. Well, your father told me about what is happening to you. At your age this type of disorder is kind of normal. The good thing is that we can start a treatment on time, before it becomes irreversible -Cheers. -Cheers, my love. Are you sure it's what you want? Yes, Daddy, I'm sure You are very good. I'm very impressed with your progress. You have advanced a lot. Thank you, I can't wait until my dad is back from his trip for Europe. He will be very happy to see my progress with the piano. -Thank you! -Yes, of course! Miss. Elisita. Mrs. Teodora escaped again. Mom? I went down to the beach and I'm going to the cemetery, I'm sorry, I have to go. Mom? Mom, are you ok? Come with me, Mom. Let's go home. o, I don't want to, leave me here. Elisa! Mom, please come. -What's wrong? -Leave me here. What's wrong? ¿Mom, do you feel ok? One more moment. Elisa, your mother is not well, we have to send her to a home. You know what I think about that, I don't like the idea of my mother in that place. Your mother is sick! The Alzheimer could be dangerous for those who suffer from it, look at her! Or her night run away, for example, what happens if one night she doesn't come back or appear dead? She only comes to the cemetery, is not that serious, if we take her to that place then she will die! Also, she is not that bad and you know that the thing is that it bothers you, let's not talk about this, please, help. Please, help me get her up. Mom! Mom! Let's go home, OK? Mom, let's go. I don't want... I don't want to. Elisa? Elisa Traverso? Elisa, how are you? It's been a long time. What a surprise, Rebeca, what are you doing here? I'm with Clotilde Barros and some more Friends, all from the MENCH. MENCH? Pro-emancipating movement of the Chilean woman, and well, we are in a type of retreat to organize what is going to be our second congress. So, you are a feminist. Very good. How is the cello going? Are you an orchestra performer yet? No, I stopped playing. Now I'm giving piano lessons. I can't believe I've met you after all this time, after all what happened. Can I ask you a question, Rebeca? Yes, of course, tell me. Who do you think you are!? Do you think I forgot what you did to me? I believe you have all the right to react like this, but I ask you please to give me an opportunity to speak with you. Don't you see? We have nothing to talk about. I need to explain, to explain to you what happened in my life after that day. I'm sorry, but I don't want to know, now excuse me, I have to leave. -Elisa! -Let me go! Thank you. Be good, Mrs Isabel, and come back next week. Elisa you are here, what a surprise! I just got informed that the acquisition of a new machine for electrotherapy has been approved. I can't wait to try it. How exciting. It's a revolution in the treatment of schizophrenia and paranoia. Do you see what this means? I'm sure this can be useful in the treatment of other diseases! How does it work? It seeks to generate seizures through the direct application of electricity to the brain without drugs. In simple words. Isn't dangerous to apply electricity directly to the brain? Mmm, no contradictions have been registered so far. I imagine that the electricity must be fantastic for health. No, my love, everything is in the dosage. What is not certain, rather, it's how good it can be. I'm sure it could help your mother calm those anxiety attacks that make her suffer so much. If your enthusiasm is that much, it must be good. We'll see, try with your patient first. Absolutely, light of my soul. Now, I must take care some investment details. -See you at home. -Yes! Sorry, is there something wrong? Do you need to talk to me? No, I was close and I wanted to see you. Well, see you later. So it is, and woman have more and more participation. Hi, Quenita, thanks. Right. In countries like France, Italy and Spain. You know, this girl says that in the next elections woman will have the right to vote too. Not yet, dear, but soon we will be able. It is what is happening worldwide. Hello, nice to meet you, I'm Valentina Letelier. My pleasure, Ma'am? Miss. What brings you here, Miss Letelier? Well, I'm a writer, actually, a journalist with ambitious of being a writer and I came to stay the season here at the beach. I'm a great piano amateur and I have been told that you are the best piano teacher around. And not only here, but maybe the whole country. -I'm Doctor Darío Alberti. -My pleasure. and the lovely, apparently suddenly speechless, woman next to me is my wife Elisa. Nice to meet you. O course.. I don't start from zero, I need to hear to you play, then see if I can teach you something. Of course. I don't understand music, so I'll leave you both alone. How dare you to come to my home? Are you out of your mind? You did not betray me. I knew you would not do it. I thought you did not know how to play. It was so, but I have learned something in these years. I learn to not forget about you. Did you receive my letters? I knew it. I knew your father would protect them. How dare you to talk about my father like that? You didn't even know him! I know men. I would have destroy them anyways. What you did to me does not have a name. I know, but in the letters I tried to explain what I felt, I was confused. I think I tried to push you away from me. fear to deal with who I'm. What are you, a Tomboy? Is this what your psychiatrist husband calls it? Well yes, I have known for some time and I did not want face it. And you helped me. and I betrayed you. Why are you here? I came to clarify some things, and why you are not happy either? For your information I'm very happy, I'm married to an excellent man, he cured me from my illness. In fact, he can cure you. Oh, Elisa, please! What you have is nothing but an anomaly, can be treated. It worked for me. It worked? You are beautiful. Forgive me, please. I can forgive you, what else. You will keep being a bitch. Give me an opportunity. I only want to be your friend. Did the new student pass the test? Yes, the lady can come back tomorrow. My father is very happy with what I have learned. I tell him that it's your merit, really I don't have words to thank you for all you have done for me. I'm very grateful. I only do my job. I want to tell you that I don't like the way you touch me and hug me. You make me feel uncomfortable, so don't do it anymore. I don't understand. Yes you do. Now please leave, the lesson is over. I found them... the letters. Did you read them? Rebeca, I need you to stop, I'm married. Yes, married to your shrink. I won't allow you to offend him. He is an excellent man. A brilliant doctor. You don't know all he has done for me. After all you've given, I guess he should feel paid for. You have no idea. when we got married we were the talk of his colleagues, an investigator, a visionary that was destined to be very important for Chilean medicine was destined to stay here, treating crazy people. Elisa, if he fell in love with you, the sacrifice was worth it. I was talking to Clotilde about you. She said that she would love to meet you. Tomorrow we're having a party at her house and many artists will be there, you could bring the Cello and play something. They would be happy. I don't know, it is very compromising for me. Besides, I don't usually go out much. That's not like this, this is the way you play. You should go out more. You are a beautiful woman. You still are the same pretty lady, you are a pearl, it's a crime that the world doesn't know you. God, how exaggerated. It's true, you are the best I've seen and I know a lot of people. Come on, come to the party, bring the cello. I'm sure you will shine. You think? Good afternoon. Class is over. Excuse me, see you later. I have to travel to Vaparaíso, my electrotherapy machine arrived. They just notified me. I have to go get it. Really? Good for you. That student of yours is pretty. Valentina Letelier? Yes, she is pretty. Was she talking about the female vote to with mother the other day? Yes, she is friend of Clotilde Barros Borgoño. Do you know her? No, no idea of who that lady might be. She leads a feminist movement. They fight for equal rights and the right to vote in the presidential elections. That is absurd, the majority of women don't vote, they are not prepared to understand what the country needs. Yet we are ready to have and raise children, the most important job that can be done. Are we becoming a feminist? I found your question very out of place. It is scientifically proven that women are more sentimental beings than rational. The psychologists associates the female decisions to an emotional condition. Besides, you said it right, being a mother is the most important job that can be done. Don't you think that if women participate in politics they could neglect their children? The fact that you know how to argue better than me doesn't mean you are right. I don't like it, I don't want you to give her any more lessons. What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about! OK, I won't give her any more lessons. Good. Eugenia! I have to travel to Valparaiso, I will be gone for few days. Don't take your eyes off of Elisa. I want you to be aware of everything: if she goes out, what time she comes back, if someone visits her, everything. It is for the best interest of my wife, I'm afraid of her emotional stability. Here, you can reach me at this number. Yes, Sir. Take care of her. Quenita! Yes, Elisita? I'm going out. OK, Elisita, as you wish. I'll have food ready when you come back. No, don't worry; I'm going to be late, also, there will be food where I'm going. Go to sleep early. OK, Elisita. I'm glad you came, Elisa. Look. What is that? Absinthe. I have never seen anything so green in my life. “Absinthe is as poetical as anything in the world.” Sorry, I haven't introduced you, Peter, Elisa, Elisa, Peter. Peter is psychiatrist like your husband. My colleague is a very lucky man. His name is Darío Alberti. He didn't come because he had to go to the hospital. I don't know him, the truth is that I don't have many links with clinical psychiatry. My thing is the psychoanalysis, a fascinating technique, but unfortunately unknown in Chile. My husband is a big admirer of Freud. Of course, Darling, we all are. Excuse me. Cheers, because we both are here. Rebeca? Are you going to introduce your friend? Yes, this is Elisa. Nice to meet you, Elisa. Rebeca told me that you are a great musician, where is your cello? Rebeca exaggerates. The truth is that I actually play the piano more. And why's that? Because my husband doesn't like the cello. Can I tell you something? You can't run from yourself, you can't. When you figure out that your life is yours, it doesn't matter where you are, you will be free. It's easy to say for a woman like you. Not really, I was married to a controlling man. He wanted to dominate every aspect of my life When I realized that, I decided to be a person again and not my husband's puppet. Believe me, I was born again. Elisa, don't be afraid of freedom, it's your freedom. Thanks. I will introduce you to my friends. Would you like to go to the beach? I would love to, I know a place. Let's go.. This beach is called the “beach of the dead” as many people have drowned here. That is very sad. Once you get in there you can't get out. The way out is through those rocks that are there and back down the bay. If you return by the beach, the water will suck you until you get tired and drown. I like that, it is a road of no return, just like the one we have taken. I haven't taken any road yet. Elisa, last night you let yourself go and everything is flowing. Forget about the fear, please. I don't know, I need to be alone. To think. Tomorrow I'm leaving on the first train that departs. I have nothing to do here, this is a sad place and even sadder is seeing you with your husband making you to cheat on him. You would make me very happy if you came with me. Rebeca, I can't, you know what my situation is. Also, my mother is here, I won't leave her alone. Bring her with you. She is a lovely lady. You can be with her, Elisa. You don't know what you are asking of me. Yes I do! I would ask you a thousand times if necessary because I know that I'm not happy as I am when I'm with you. Promise me that you will think about it . I promise. Mom! Mom! My mom! Where did you sleep last night? where is my mother? Don't waste your time. Your mother had an issue and I had no option but to institutionalize her. You did what? How dare you! Where did you sleep last night? We will talk about it later. I want my mother back immediately. No, let's talk about that now! I slept with Rebeca! Rebeca? Rebeca Subercaseaux. What? My new student, it's her, she came for me, you know what? The worst of her caresses made me feel better and more alive than all and each of the nights I had to spend with you! Yes, Darío I'm what you and your colleagues call a lesbian. I could never love a man for real. You are sick! No, Darío, this is who I am. No! You are sick, morally and mentally. I don't know and I don't care. What I do know is that I don't love you. I love her and I want a divorce. A divorce and my mother back! Good point. Remember that I have authority over your mother. I'm her doctor. If you want your mother back you have to put her under treatment. What are you saying? You leave me no alternative. What are you talking about? I already told you this doesn't have a cure, it's not an illness Yes, it's an illness. A complex illness, but now we can cure it. OK.. But bring my mother back first. I love you, Elisa, I'm sure this is best for you. What we are going to do is to give you daily electroshock for seven days. That will kill the variant in your brain that causes the anomalous behavior. Nurse. Are you ready? You will not notice and you will be fine. Hello, beautiful. What happened? Nothing, Darío is curing me, he says that my ailment is a hysteria crisis I feel good and very relaxed. The treatment is over! Elisa, we're getting out of here. Even if I have to call the police. No, Rebeca, no. It's late, I don't want to leave, I'm good here and I want to stay. This will not keep happening like this! Elisa, I will be back, I have influential friends, more than that pseudo doctor. Don't worry, I'll get you out of here. Ma'am, Mr. Darío is about to arrive. If he finds the lady here, I don't know what could happen. What's your name? Elisa. Elisa del Pilar Traverso Agüero. How old are you? Twenty-four. What's your father name Don't worry, the amnesia usually has a transitory effect. How nice. What are you doing here? Good evening, sorry to bother you, I'm Dr. Peter Stevens from Columbia University. Dr. Stevens, of course I know you. My apologies for my welcome, but you caught me by surprise. I do know your work. I have been told that you are giving electroshock... -Exactly. -...to Elisa. I brought the machine myself from Italy. -Please, come with me. -Yes, of course. Miss Subercaseaux can wait in the drawing room, this is mainly professional. I want you to congratulate you, her progress is really impressive. Thank you, coming from you it's a compliment. -What's going on? -Wait outside, princess. I hope to continue this conversation in Santiago. -Of course. -Elisa, where is Elisa? Princess, the work that Dr. Alberti is doing is very good. What does that mean? Elisa is responding to the treatment, let's go. You said that we were leaving with her! What happened? It's a hysteria crisis, apparently the electrotherapy is best for her. Besides, Elisa doesn't want to leave, she agrees with her husband. I not moving from this spot. Did you see how she is doing? Relax! You don't understand these matters. Sorry for the interruption, doctor Darío. I'm not leaving. Let go of me! You want to sedate her, Doctor? No, its fine, thanks. Elisa! Elisa! How you feel? Good. Do you think that.we could? Yes, I believe so, but try to be gentle. Of course, my love. I love you, Elisa. Oh! Elisa? Elisa! Elisa! Elisa! Elisa, no! Elisa, no! No! Bye, Mom.
