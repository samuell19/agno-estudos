Calm down, calm down, calm down. Agh! Calm down! I'm OK, bro. We're OK. What can I getcha, doll? Y'know what? I'm gonna go with a ginger ale. Y'know what? Make it a diet. Yeah, I gotta check if we have that. - OK, you do that. - A beer if we don't? I'm gonna take it up a notch and go with a water. OK? - How many times have I... - French! Brother, are you gonna do somethin' about this? Fuckin' prick. Y'all fuckin' prick! A'right, a'right. Break it up. Break it up. Let him go. Take it outside. Yeah? - Get outside now! - Fuck off, Harry Stiles. - This don't concern you. - Listen, mate. You can kick seven shades of shite out of each other, for all I care, but you're doin' outside. Otherwise it is my concern! Who the fuck do you think you are? - Ugh! - French... don't do it. Now listen to me. Calm down, OK? You see him? See that guy? His name's Irv, and that's my boss. Now, he's given me strict instructions. You gotta take all violence outside the premises. OK, lads? Because I've had a few unfortunate events over the past few weeks, and I've caused a bit of damage, and... I promised him I'm gonna turn over a new leaf, OK? So, please. Take it outside and let me finish my breakfast. A'right? What d'you reckon, lads? Shall we match his faggy, English ass outside? Like we did 100 years ago? More like 250 years, I think. But that's by the by, isn't it? Anyway... wasn't exactly fair fight back then, was it? It was us against you, and we kicked your sorry asses all the way back across the Atlantic! - Nah, you didn't, mate. - Sent you home crying to your bitch queen! Nah, they didn't, mate. Well, it wasn't a queen, actually, mate. No, it was a king. King George III to be precise. But, well, I wouldn't expect you lot to know that. I mean, you probably never read a book in your life, have ya? So, allow me to educate ye geriatric Yank fucks. See, you had help from the Spanish... the French... oh, and the Dutch. And yeah, all right. We might've taken a bit of a kickin', but the odds were against our boys. Just like they are against me now, to be honest. But d'you know what? I fuckin' like these odds. 'Cause like good ol' King George always used to say, "Come and fucking get it!" On your six, Frenchie! Cheers, mate! I gotta tell you somethin', pal. - You still got it. - You got every move. - The fuck? - Uhh! I thought you were dead. Well, so did I, Frenchie. Believe me. A story for another time. Outside, French! A word. I love this fuckin' place! Mmm! Don't do this, OK? I need this job. I need it, mate. Please, don't do this. And I need a club that doesn't have to be renovated once a week 'cause of what you do. Listen, brother. After the cost of the busted-up furniture, and your unpaid bar tab, there's 80 bucks. Good luck. Oh, 80 bucks, yeah? Yeah? Well, good luck findin' someone else to scrape up the shit that comes in this place! It's a shit hole, mate! Was nice to see that things are workin' out for you, pal. I'm very happy about that, I am. Hey y'know, what it's worth, if, uh, if you wanna finish that breakfast, there's a place next door. Maybe we can, you know... Why, are you buyin'? Since you got no job no more... why not? Come on, Frenchie. It's still just "French," by the way! Mmm. Mmm. Ahh. - Mmmm! - I can't believe it. I can't believe you're sat right here in front of me. I thought for sure that you were a goner. Mm, believe me, I was. Flat-lined two times on that slab. - Yeah? - Mm-mm. - Jesus. - If it wasn't for Tommy, I probably wouldn't be here right now. Paid a lot of money to make me undead. Yeah. Got shot up pretty bad, Frenchie. Stomach, one vertebra. One up here in the lung. Can you imagine? Yeah? Actually, had to leave one in near my spine. - Fuck. - Yeah. Well, kudos to you, mate, because, uh, y'know what? As far as zombies go... you're lookin' all right. Hm. Mmm. So, where's my coupe? Oh, I'm fine, Sue. Don't worry about the injuries I took. Yeah, thanks for asking. Oh, no, no. It's not like that. See, I just... because of the, um... Oh, c'mon, Frenchie. How you doin'? Really, I'm sorry. Just... How you doin'? - I'm all right. - Yeah? - I'm pretty good. - Yeah? Took two in the chest. One here, one there. I dunno how, but I somehow managed to crawl back to the car, all right, and drive myself to the emergency room. - Well. - I was surprisingly all right. I mean, I've seen a soldier shoot himself in the foot, and he died. Yet I take two in the chest and somehow manage to live to tell the tale. Human body, mate, it's a fucked up thing, I'm telling you. - I'll tell you this as well. - Mm-hmm? Had to blag the police at the hospital, though. Told 'em my gun went off, whilst I was cleaning it. Bet they bought that, am I right? They did. I dunno. Maybe they couldn't be arsed with the paperwork. Well... Hmm. So, where's my coupe? Didn't shoot out that loving bedside manner of yours, did they? Frenchie, where's my fuckin' car? I fuckin' sold that car, mate. You did what? You did what... With who? With what? What? I sold the car to a chop shop, didn't I? Didn't have a fuckin' choice, did I? It was covered in my blood, wasn't it? Listen, that was like a bullseye for every gangster in East LA. So, I flogged that thing. Lemme ask you somethin'. By chance, how much... did you sell this classically-designed vehicle for? Dunno, it was about six grand. Fuck me, Frenchie! Six grand? Six... Just the fuckin' rims alone are worth six fuckin' grand! - You understand me, right? - Hey. I am sorry. Everything is under control. My apologies. You know, you're unbelievable. - And I don't like this... this tone. - What tone? - This tone. - I haven't got a fuckin' tone. What you talkin' about? - Oh yeah, you do. You do. I come as a friend, I catch the bus to come and see my friend. I come all this way, and you give me this... tone. No, you caught the bus, mate, to come and get your precious coupe. Hey, is that the only reason you come here, then? Actually, no. It's not the only reason. I came for Tommy. He's got a job for us. Two days, three vigs. We're in, we're out. What do you say? Are you fuckin' kidding me? OK. Fuck off, mate. Yeah? D'you know what? I only did that job for three days, we both almost fucking died! No chance. Get stuffed. "Never again. Can't do it!" Listen to you, right? Let me tell you somethin' else. It's a favor for Tommy. You owe him. No, I don't think I do. OK. Tell you what. I'll do it for Tommy, you can do it for the money. I ain't that desperate, mate. Oh yeah? We both know that's not true. Right? C'mon, French, think about it. Get to split $70K. How much? - Hm? - How much? Seventy K. One more job, and you can be gone forever. You can go home and do whatever it is the fuck you wanna do. You can open your gym. Besides, Frenchie, you know I need this one. You'd be doing me a square one, yeah? I'm gettin' nowhere with the 'just call me French' thing, am I? It's a term of endearment. Yeah. Whatever, Susan. One last job. - Yeah. - Three last jobs. While you think about it, I tell you what. Per our previous discussion. I'll take care of breakfast. I might leave another $20. Why? Because I can. You want more of this? I'll see you outside. So, what have you been doin' for the past seven months? You know, apart from rising from the dead? You ever think it might be a nice idea to, uh, let me know you were still alive? Well, I did consider doing that, Frenchie, but Tommy told me to remain incognito, so that's what I did, yeah? Yeah, he said the same thing to me, too. That's why I've been working outta this shit pit. What a coincidence! I get fired the same day you turn up. Whoa, wait a minute. What the fuck is this? It's called a car, mate. No, it's a wheelchair with a fuckin' roof, Frenchie. You traded in my classic for this piece of shit? You should be ashamed of yourself. It doesn't drink gas like a battleship, it's clean, it's quiet. And it doesn't smell like your arse on the inside. All right? Now look, if we're gonna do this, I'm gonna have to go home and get a change of clothes. Oh, no, no, no. Got no time for you to change, OK? You look beautiful. On a time schedule. Where are we off to first then? Las Vegas. Is that OK with you? - Vegas? - Vegas. Jesus Christ. I fuckin' hate Vegas. D'you want that one? No, I don't like that one. Nah, that's a bit shit, uh? I like, uh, rock music. All right, Frenchie, how about we take it easy with the DJ'ing, eh? What do say? Oh. So, where are we headed to in Vegas then, mate? We're stickin' with a vig. Oh, the ol' vig, eh? So, we are... Have a look, Frenchie. My specs must've... Hang on a minute. Vegas is number two on this list. How come we're goin' there first and who's this Mal Reese bird? Little tip, Frenchie. Always start farthest away from home and work your way back, yeah? Mal Reese... Mal Reese is a bona fide class act outta Louisiana, yeah? Her old man moved here when he was a kid, Frenchie, to work for the Ukrainian Crime Family. Wasn't a pure-bred, so one day he got an OBE. "One behind the ear." Anyways, it was the mid-80s. Mal was in her late 20s. So, she started working for the Family under an alias. Yeah? Pretty smart girl, Frenchie. She knew everything, where every penny was banked, where every body was buried. After a time, she'd developed a lot of power. Slowly but surely, she became very rich, very powerful. Then one day... she decides to wipe out the whole fuckin' family. How do you know all this, then? I mean, the Urfalian family... I've never heard of 'em. I had this on-and-off thing with her for about three years. She was the best fuck on the West Coast. Crazy ones usually are, am I right? - Are you serious? - Don't fuckin' say anything, don't even hint you know anything. OK? 'Cause if she looks in your eyes, and she thinks that I told you a fuckin' word, she'll kill us both. I mean it, yeah? Fuckin' sounds like a right crazy bitch to me. Oh, she is, Frenchie, but I don't wanna wind up hurting her, you know. Physically, I mean. I'm done with the violence, brother. I'm done. Done with violence? What's that supposed to mean? It means no more hurtin' my fellow man. "No more hurtin' my fellow man"? You takin' the piss, mate? No, I'm not takin' the piss! What I'm tryin' to tell you is maybe, OK? Maybe, if it's fucking life-threatening! Well, good luck with that, mate. Yeah. We'll see how you get on with that. Answer me this though, right? How do you expect to clear three vigs in two days, and not get your little paws muddy? How's that gonna work? That's why I got you here. No. No-no-no-no-no. No, no, no. You want me to do this with you, we're gonna do 50-50, right? Partners. You're not gonna be warmin' up the bench, whilst I get roasted in the thick of it again. Let's hope it doesn't get to that. But it probably fucking will, won't it? Let's be honest. Do me a favor. Pull over at the next stop, Frenchie. I could use a drink. Fill 'er up, Frenchie. I'm gonna go pay inside. He walkin' his ass over here. Fucker really comin' over. 'Sup, lads... can I help you with somethin'? I don't know, French, can you? Clock's tickin', motherfucker. Tick-tock, tick-tock. Bitch-ass motherfucker, man. Mm. You OK, Frenchie? - See that Black SUV there? - Oh yeah, I see it. - Right, yeah? - Yeah. Well, there's a couple of massive blokes inside. One of em's got a fuck-off machine gun. And he knew my name. What's that all about? Well, they've been following me ever since I left LA. - You what? - Oh yeah. And actually, they were outside your dive bar up in Rancho. Lemme ask you, what happened to your paratrooper observation skills back there, Frenchie? Just wonderin'. Oh, I dunno, mate. Maybe I was a little bit dulled from the kickin' I just took! Why are they tailin' us? I dunno, Frenchie. Maybe they're workin' for who Tommy's collectin' for. What for? To make sure we get the money or what? Oh yeah. To make sure we get the money and then make sure we don't run away with the money. OK? C'mon... Why the fuck would we run away with the money, mate? And who's Tommy collectin' for? Frenchie, I don't have the answers to all these questions. All I know is it's the right play. Get the money back to Tommy, take the cream off the vig, and we get on our way. Come on. Avante. Let's go. I dunno about this, mate. Well, are we gonna do this then, or what? Yeah, I mean, just give me a minute, will you, Frenchie? Just a minute, yeah? - You all right, mate? - I'm fine. - Look like you're shittin' it. - What? You're scared because of this bird, aren't you? I ain't afraid of anybody. You know that, right? - Yeah? - But, Mal... she's different. Well, you better sharpen them fangs, mate. Because we're on a deadline, aren't we. Remember? Let's go. Miss Reese is a busy woman. So, be judicious in your conversation, get to the point quickly. Follow me. Check out the thighs on that, mate. How much do you reckon she charges people to put them in a scissor hold? Gee, I'm tellin' you, be serious. You're gonna get us both killed. Fuckin' hell. ♪ Ohhh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ I drive to your place It's getting late ♪ ♪ Take you anywhere you need ♪ Sound check's still going. So, stay out of the way. ♪ But these headlights Are takin me away ♪ Tiny, get them a drink. All right, Miss Reese'll be right with you. Thank you. Hey. I'll take a water, please.

Frenchie, just... be serious, yeah? ♪ 'Cause I can't stay here anymore ♪ Thank you. ♪ But I can't leave you ♪ Sulinski "Golden Boy" Baker. The return of the main contender. Mal Reese. Still a knockout. Yeah. But we both know it was you that got knocked out. Never quite make it back from that night. Y'know what? Maybe I never will, Mal. But either way, it's really nice to see you again. Well, the sun is over the yardarm, and I know you were never one to say no to a drink. Actually, uh... Kind of all finished with that now, Mal. Yeah, clean and sober all the way. We're just here on business. Tommy called. It's the $155K that I was loaned. We're gonna have to collect. Well, the money's ready. I got it prepared after the phone call. But... No games. OK? No games. I borrow a large sum of money to save my bacon, and the money comes from a really bad cat. But then he goes and gets himself killed. So, I think I got lucky and got off. But then you show up on my doorstep to collect. Who's playing games with who, Sue? Listen, love. We traveled a very long way through a hot bloody desert to collect this. OK? We're not here to pussyfoot around. So, you already prepared the readies, let's have it... and we'll clear out. Yeah? Does the English shoe salesman know who he's talking to, and what I do to bad little boys who talk out of turn? Actually, Mallory, we were just discussing this. He has a hard time listening, but... he's OK. In my club, you call me Miss Reese. It's a term of respect, and I demand res... Miss Reese, please. Give us the money, and we'll go. OK? What is your name, little boy? It's, uh, it's French. They call him French, just like the kiss. - You cut me off, Mr. French. - It's just French, by the way. OK, listen. Mallory, we've come a long way from LA, we have to go all the way back. We're very tired, OK? Just... please. You've met Miss Britt. She has your money. Give the bag to Mr. French. Get it, Frenchie. She'll be shooting some footage. Film Mr. French checking the money's all there and accounted for. Y'know what, Mallory, maybe you should keep filming until we get all the way to the car, if you're planning on showin' this tape to Tommy. Good idea. Film them all the way to the car. ♪ Where did you go? ♪ Are we good? Yeah. Why don't you hang with me a minute, Sue? It's OK, Frenchie. I got it. I'm sure Mr. French can find his own way. ♪ It all just disappears ♪ You were so handsome. Now you look like a jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone wrong. Hm. I think I, uh, can taste the caviar you had for dinner last night, Mal. You could have been right here at my side. But you chose LA instead, and look where that got you. When you're washing the gray hair on your balls tonight, I want you to think of me and the life that you rejected. Now, piss off and deliver your bone like a good little fetch-dog. Mallory. You know, you got great lips. You still do. And you still scare the fuckin' piss out of me, but... your lips are magnificent. ♪ Can't feel you anymore ♪ ♪ It all just disappears ♪ I'll tell you what, that was a piece of piss, wasn't it? She just gave us the money. Hard ten my arse, mate. What's your problem? She gave it up way too easy, Frenchie. OK? Mal Reese... No, listen to me. That's not the Mal Reese I know. Trust me. Jesus Christ! Didn't I fuckin' tell you, Frenchie? There she is, right on cue, yeah? That's why they were filmin' us. I've heard it being done before, but no one's ever done it to me. Do me a favor. Get us outta this mess. Do somethin' slick, yeah? Oh! Precision driving, Frenchie. Very impressive. - You really showed 'em, you know that? - Shut up! Y'know, you can take the wheel whenever you want, you know. It wouldn't make a difference, right? 'Cause this piece of shit couldn't get away anyway! OK. What do we got here? A machine gun, three batons. What do you wanna do? You can curb that shit about denouncing violence for a start. It ain't denouncing you! Is it, mate? Hey! Is it? We're just here for the money, boys! Play nice, we'll be nice back. OK, this ginger prick. AK 47. That is pretty much the wankiest assault rifle anyone could get. Two million Russian soldiers would disagree with you. Yeah, but look how he's limp-wristing the receiver. I bet you this prick's never had a range session in his life. OK. If he gets close enough, I'm gonna take him. You can dance with the other three, yeah? Wait a minute. You get to take out one, I get to take out three. How's that fair? I'm gonna take the one with the assault rifle, Sue. You just told me he didn't know how to hold the gun! And one of yours is a girl. She look like a girl? That's a fuckin' monster. You hit 'em, they go down. Simple. Come on, Frenchie, look. I haven't hit a woman in a long time, brother. Well, that means you're rested then, doesn't it? Yeah? So, go on, get out there. Give it a bit of the ol' Golden Boy hospitality. You remember how to do that, yeah? - F-you, Frenchie. - Out of the car, asshole. You hit me with the bat, I'm so... You can run for now. This ain't over! Well, let's get something straight. We're not the ones runnin'! Go on, get outta here. Go on, get outta here! C'mon, Sue! Nice work, old man. Guess bein' dead didn't dampen your technique. Gee, what can I tell ya? She hit me in the head with a bat. Ah c'mon, mate. She didn't give you a choice. Wouldn't beat yourself up about it. You guys done rollin' around in the dirt? Oh, it's nice to see you guys show up. Yeah? Here's an idea for ya. How 'bout next time, you get out and you give us a fuckin' hand. - Nah. - Yeah. We just like watchin' you two fight. Not bad for a couple has-beens. Ha-ha-ha. Fuck off. Look at blondie, man. I recognize those eyes anywhere. I'm tellin' you, dog, it's him! What's he sayin', Frenchie? I didn't hear him, mate. - Jesus, who are these guys, Sue? - I don't know. Should I be worried about who the fuck they're working for? Let's just focus on the job. We talked about it. One down, two to go. Let's just move on. We gotta go. No-no-no. No. No way I'm drivin' back through the night to Los Angeles. OK? No chance. We're checkin' into a motel. - I need my rest. - We're on a time schedule! We need to have the money in by Friday. - We talked about this! - Yeah, I need some goddamn rest, if I'm expected to keep smashing people senseless. Listen, mate. These machines, they don't work without the cog. What? The cog. The machines don't work without the cog. - Oh Jesus Christ, Frenchie... - I need some rest! OK, you win! Hotel, for sure. Let's go! Yeah. Hey, Tommy. So, we got the money from Mal Reese. That's first one down, two to go. She play nice? Ah, you know. Nice enough, I guess. But, um, I got a question, yeah. Seem to have picked up some company. Two brothers armed to bear. They been shadowing us from LA. They happen to be part of this deal? Yeah, just makin' sure you don't blow with the dough. Yeah. I figured as such, right. How you doin', Tommy? You doin' OK? Don't worry about me, just worry about the next two jobs. I don't know, is there anything else maybe I need to know about this one, yeah? Uh, it's kinda hard to talk right now. Yeah, I understand, Tommy. No problem. I'll check in with you tomorrow, OK? You look after yourself. I'm sorry I got you into this, Sue. Is that you, Frenchie? Come on in. It's open! I managed to snag one of these from across the street. Thought it might help me sleep. Come in. Come here, what d'you got there? Oh, you know me. Got a bit of the old, uh, Rooster. - Rooster Rojo? - Yeah. Can you imagine? This is my brand, Frenchie. - Yeah? - Yeah! Yeah. How very thoughtful of you, but, uh... I'm afraid I must decline. Stone cold turkey. You remember what I said. But thank you, Frenchie. Nice gesture. - I thought you were bullshittin'. - Oh, no. Yeah? Well, I guess gettin' shot by a machine gun'll make you reevaluate those decisions in life. Yeah? By the way, it's 100% blue agave. You got the good stuff. So, come on then, mate. Said you died twice, right? You see anythin'? I mean, you know, like... bright lights or your life flash before your eyes? Nah. How 'bout you? - What did you see? - What did I see? Nah, I wasn't anywhere near close to bumpin' off like you, mate. But, um... Let's be honest. It's kind of embarrassin'. Embarrassin'? Why's that? Well, look. I don't know if I was hallucinatin' or what, but the nurse that wheeled me into the ICU, she was fit as fuck, mate. I'm tellin' ya. Honestly, right? Platinum blonde hair, blue eyes, narrow waist. Right? And the nurse's outfit? I didn't know where to look. So anyway, right, it's fucking freezin' in this place, right? It's like the Baltic. Yeah? And I'm shiverin' like some sort of shittin' dog. But I'm tryin' to keep it together, 'cause I'm lookin' up at this bird, and she's cuttin' my clothes off. And I'm tryin' to look like the Fonz, you know? Like gettin' shot is just a regular occurrence for this stud. D'you know what I mean? So anyway, there she is. She cut off my jeans, she cut off my underwear. And before I know it, I am stark, bollock naked. OK? Now, here's the thing. I'm not a small man, Sue. OK? I'm no thoroughbred stallion either, but it's a perfectly healthy size, right? But the thing is... it is so fucking cold in this place, right? My old fella has decided to shrink back into his hole to the size of a little nub. Right? It was like a fucking thimble, mate. It was pathetic. I mean, just when you want him to, like, stand up proud... nothin'. It's fuckin' embarassin'. Well, if I may, Frenchie, I must admit that, uh, it would make any man blush, yeah? So, come on then, mate. What about you? You must remember somethin'. We're tight, right? - Of course, we are, mate. Yeah. - Yeah? 'Cause what happened to me was perfect, yeah? Absolutely perfect. And to be honest, the chance to finally tell someone you respect makes it feel all the more special. I saw her, Frenchie. I saw Milly. She was smilin', she was wavin' back at me. And that the thing here, y'know? She was happy. She wasn't disappointed in her old man, as I thought she would be all these years. She looked like a little angel, staring back at me. Ah. She made me so happy, Frenchie, I could've just faded away right there. Yeah. That's beautiful, mate. Bloody hell. Here I am, bangin' on about my tiny cock, and you've gone and hit me with the, uh, one-two knockout emotional punch. Y'know I'm not really a religious man, Sue. I don't really believe in any of that, but... whatever that was... I'm glad you got to see her, mate. Yeah, me too, Frenchie. Me too. Ah, it's good stuff. Take it easy on that stuff, OK? We got an early rise in the morning. Yeah, I'll be fine, mate. Don't worry about me. Oh, you were right, by the way. You know, the day we got shot? I should've listened to you. If I'd listened to you, we'd both be better off than we are now, that's for sure. Glad you're still alive, mate. OK, Frenchie. We're here. Looks like we're a little early, so let's kick back a little bit, yeah? Wait till the owner gets here. Do me a favor, wake me up when he does? I'm gonna take a little nap. Yeah, all right, mate. You get your beauty sleep. I'm serious, Frenchie. Just... just wake me up, yeah? I don't want it to be too much of a stretch. Listen, mate, the only one around here who needs to do some stretchin' is you. You got a tone. Have a nice nap. Come on, oi. Come on, mate. Get up. I got you a cup of coffee, yeah? There we go. Wakey-wakey, mate. All right? This is damn good coffee, Frenchie. Jesus Christ, mate. Do you gimp out like that every morning? Just startin' the engines, yeah? Sounded like you were rapin' a rocking horse to me. Let's take a look at the vig, shall we? OK. All right. Esteban Madrid, $95,000, City of Angles Boxing Club. What... wa-wa-wa? This a boxing club? I didn't realize it was a boxing club. That's because you don't concentrate when you read things, Frenchie. Yeah, that's right. You. I know this guy. He's been around, he's trained a lot of good fighters. Let me tell you. The number of these guys that can actually fight is woefully fuckin' small. Yeah, same as pro MMA. Yeah, well, pro boxing, maybe it's a little different. Yeah? Y'know, it's precise. There's discipline. There's these. Yeah? Hang on a minute. You're tryin' to tell me that martial arts doesn't involve discipline? Because I think a lot of people might disagree with that, mate. Just a few people. Well, that's not what I'm sayin', Frenchie. OK? And I'm also not sayin' that a boxer's gonna beat an MMA guy. What I am sayin' is, it's the sweet science. It's fuckin' classy. Oh yeah, mate. Really classy, yeah. Bitin' peoples' ears off. I mean, come on. It doesn't get more corrupt... Whoa-whoa-whoa, Frenchie. French. What? Is it fuckin' open? Did he go inside? Ahh, you don't know. Right? You were supposed to be on fuckin' watch, Frenchie! Well, I'm sorry, mate, but I was gettin' you a coffee, wasn't I? This here's the difference between us leavin' with the money and gettin' our fucking asses kicked by a bunch of prizefighters, yeah? All I'm sayin' is, you're a little sloppy. Listen, mate, I'm not the one kippin' on the job, am I? - That's you. Eh? - Wouldn't be kippin' If I didn't have to fuckin' drive this piece of shit for fuckin' hours across... Yeah? Whatever! Come on, let's get in there, before the rest turn up. Yeah? Fuckin' hell. The smell, Frenchie. Something you never forget. The smell. Hey, hey-hey! Fellas, you can't just walk in and hit the bag! Right? You gotta check in, you gotta sign a waiver. We ain't takin' new members right now. All right? So, hey, gramps. Gramps. Take it easy! All right? We don't wanna have to break out the defibrillator for you. Oh, I wouldn't worry about him, mate. - He's tougher than he looks. - Yeah, I ain't worried, pal. - I'm tellin' you two assholes, get the fuck outta my gym. - Ooh! Ah, there's no need for language like that, pal. We're here to see Mr. Madrid. OK? So, hop along and get him, would ya? Fuck off. Listen, mate. If you're gonna get saucy, fuckin' do somethin'. All right? 'Cause I ain't got time to piss about, comparing whose is bigger. If you knew me, you'd know that mine is. Oh, right. OK. You're a tough guy, are ya? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Little bit. - OK. Well, y'know this confidence that you're showin' me right now? It's fuckin' blind, mate. 'Cause you don't know me from Adam. But what you need to know is that I'm the bloke who's just walked into a boxing club and stepped up to the brashest gobshite who ever wanted a crack at the title, and I'm callin' him a cunt. And I'm doin' it in front of all of his boyfriends, too. Yeah? So, either that makes me the biggest dog in the yard... or a complete, fuckin' nutcase. Either way, mate, do as I said. Hop along, get your boss, yeah? OK. I will get Mr. Madrid. - Yeah, you do that. - Yeah. He'll sort this shit out. Wow. You know, for someone who doesn't like his job, you really know how to throw yourself into it, Frenchie. Nice. Just tryin' to get this done and put this shite behind us. Besides, they're only boxers, right? Vaughan, tell Sugar to come join us. Tommy said you'd be stopping by. Good. Then we won't have to go 'round and 'round. Ninety-five large. Let's have it. That money was a sponsorship deal, backin' one of my boys. Wasn't a loan, so, it's not a debt. I don't borrow money I can't pay back. So, it's now our money. So, you can tell Tommy where he can stick it. Always seems to get complicated, doesn't it, Sue? Yeah, well, we wouldn't have a job if it didn't, Frenchie. OK, so look. I've been doing this a very long time, yeah? - So... - I know. You bested one of my prospects, back in the day. You ruined his title shot. Oh, you know who he is then. And you should also know that he's heard every goddamn excuse in the book. So, listen, mate. We're in nice and early, aren't we? Do me a favor, give us the money and... we'll leave you be. - Oh? That's all you want? - That's right. - Hm? - Yeah. You know, if you're serious about boxing, you should never fight outside your weight division. Sugar! Get in here! These two are here to reclaim your sponsorship cash. Without it, you'll be broke. No sparring partners, no camp, no expenses. We'll see about that. Which one of you pussies is gettin' your gloves on? - I think that'll be you, mate. - Yeah. Too much of a sweet science for me anyway, right? - Is that right? - Yeah. I guess it's you. Let me tell you somethin'. After I win, I'm gonna take that fuckin' money. Trust me. - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. You ain't gonna win. Pick up the gloves, old man. I got this, French. Let's go, man. C'mon, mate, doesn't go against your new, uh, pacifist code? This isn't unnecessary violence, Frenchie. It's a sport, in its purest form. Two athletes in their prime. Yeah, but you ain't either, let's be honest. - And, here we go! - Go on, Golden Boy! Let's go! Come on, mate! Find the distance. C'mon! Whoa-whoa! It's OK! it's all right. C'mon, Sue! We can do this! Stake you move, mate. Come on! Yes! Golden Boy's up in the house! Come on, mate! You can do this! C'mon, mate, take your time! Don't lose him! Why you waitin' there? Come on! What you waitin' there, Sue! Find a way in, mate! Go on, mate! Ohh! Oh shit. You all right? - You good? - Ugh! C'mon, mate! Look at me. C'mon, mate. Up you get. Frenchie, I think he moved a bullet. Just fucking go for it! Oi, you filthy twat! The fuck was that? - Fucker's a twat! - Fuck you, piece of shit! Sue. C'mon, mate, get up. Come on, you can do it. Let's go. Frenchie, I've got three fuckin' Adam's apples. I'm done. If you don't do this, we're never gonna get that money. C'mon, mate, you can do it! Golden Boy, Let's go! You gonna sub in for ya boy? I'm tired of watching him breathe! Frenchie! Listen to me. No matter what, we're leavin' here with the fuckin' money. Go! Go do your thing. - Same terms? - Same terms, English. - Fuckin' on then. - Come on, then. Come on, Frenchie! OK. Here's my little pep talk. You're aware of the Marquess of Queensbury Rules, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, well, fuck 'em! Go do your thing. He's on your six. C'mon, Frenchie! Come on. You're good. Go after him! - Oh! - What the fuck, man? - Dirty! - What the fuck is this guy doin'? Force of habit, mate. So, sorry. There you go! Just keep those fucking gums chewing then. Come on. There you go! Aah! Jesus. Get the fuck out! Shut the fuck up! Get the fuck out! Stay down, motherfucker! Stop! I'll blow your fuckin' heads off! - Get the fuck off of me! - Get in the corner! You stay in the corner! Stay right there. - Gimme the gun, Sue! - Here ya go. Take that. Get up, motherfucker. We're goin' to get that money! - Fuck you! - Get in there! Get over there! Come on, Sue! What is this? There's two too many. We're not a robbery, we're here on business. Yeah? That's sponsorship money. Gifted to us by fucking Barbosa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, what'd you say? You said Barbosa? You fuckin' heard me. Fuckin' sucker punched me. Yeah, I've got a bad habit of doin' that. I'm sorry. Stay here, yeah? Don't you fuckin' move. Don't you fuckin' move! Gimme the bag, Frenchie! And the gun! Come on. Let's get the fuck outta here, yeah? OK, let's go! Get his ass! Actually, the kid was a ringer. Let me tell ya. He was very good. The kid could've been a good champion, until you went and splintered his forearm like you did. Y'know? It was very cold, Frenchie. Very cold. Yeah, well, I told you boxing's no match for MMA, didn't I? A lot of people would consider that cheating. I'll tell you somethin' else, Frenchie. You've changed. And you've got a tone. So, where are we off to next, anyway? Mm, OK. Let's have a look at this. OK. Give it to me. Canoga park. Deep in the Valley. Joyous. Cyrus Skinner, $255,000. Jesus Christ. Saved the heftiest for last then? That's right, Frenchie. That was the plan, brother. - Heads up. - OK. What are these two doin' here? Don't worry about it, Frenchie. Play it cool. OK? Damn, you boys are right on course. Two down and one to go, huh? You OK, though? 'Cause you boys look fucked up! - Ask him, man. - A'ight. Down-and-out. Ol' 'E' here reckons he saw you in some, uh, cheap-ass kung-fu film. - Ninja. You're the fucking Ninja. - Jesus Christ. The movie Ninja. The kung-fu movie Ninja. That's you, right? Actually, you would be correct, gentlemen. That is me, yes. - Told you so, man. I told you! - You liked that movie, yeah? Me and my brothers used to watch that movie all the time when we were kids, man. Used to watch that shit over and over again. - Wow. - But I ain't fucking with you today, man. Despite that bein' the best ninja movie I've ever seen. Hang on a minute. Are you tellin' me you've actually seen his movie? And that it was good? Bro! This fucker used to be the shit, man. Yeah? You had that somethin' special. And what the fuck happened to you? Same thing that's gonna happen to you two boys. It's called life. Yeah? It's called life. Well, maybe you can use some of your ninja skills for your next job. - Cyrus Skinner. - Let me as you a question... Don't worry about it, Frenchie. It's OK. No, I wanna ask a question, a'right? If you two are so on the ball, right, so gangster, how come we're collectin' the debts? Why not do it yourselves. Eh? Well... 'cause Molly wants to see you bleed for every buck he's owed. What you talkin' about, mate? - Don't worry. - What you talkin' about? - No, I'm worried! - It's OK. No, I'm worried about it. Who's Molly? Oh, you'll find out. Find out what, mate? Oi, I asked you a question! C'mon, Frenchie. What the fuck do they know? They're not talkin' about anything. C'mon, finish up. We gotta go. Don't worry about it. I'm gonna make a quick phone call. I'll be right back. Tell me you didn't know. Sulinski... Tell me it's as much a surprise to you as it is to me that we're collecting Barbosa's money for his brother Molly. We've had a good run, Golden Boy. If I were you, I'd take that money and run. Get the fuck outta he... Hey, hey. This is, uh, Molly X, your new boss. Listen. You owe me one more collection. So, bring that gold to Molly, and I might cream off the vig for you. And your boy Tommy can breathe easy again. Sorry, Tommy. I tried. Let's go, Tommy. It's OK, Pete. You hate LA, but here you are. Sit down. Ah, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. I actually love Los Angeles, man. I get my... Stacy Adams shined and shaved by brothers on Slauson. I get my suits tailor made at Market and Manchester in Inglewood. I got love for the West Coast, man. Cutty. Good lookin'. But what I do hate... is liars. Now, either somebody gave you some fucked up information, or you straight lied to me, man. The nature of my business depends on information. That said, I'm not the Encyclopedia Britannica. I get mine from the streets, so why don't you tell me why you're here, Molly? I'll tell you why I'm here. French and Sue. You assured me they were wasted in the same shootout that cost me my blood. A killin' that you swore to my face that you had no hand in. Your brother Barbosa was a client. It's bad business to kill clients. So, your boys capped him in self-defense, before the rest of my brother's crew cut them all down in a blaze of glory. - That's what you said, man. - That's what I said. So, if that's the straight-up truth... Why do I have emissaries out here, from Inglewood to Hollywood, sayin' that French and Sue was walkin' and talkin' and having a fine-ass time here in the streets of So Cal? They're mistaken. You're cold-blooded, Felix. That's not a wise choice of words, Tommy. Let me have a little peek up in there. What can I say, Molly? Y-you seem to be three steps ahead of me. You lied to my fuckin' face. You disrespected my brother's memory. So, for your part in all this, you gots to pay in blood equity. Cutty, let's be out. You see, my brother had three sizable debts that needed collectin' before he was killed. Tabs I can't be associated with. So, you're gonna have your two goodfellas, French and Sue, close out Barbosa's accounts for me. They don't work for me anymore. You're gonna make sure they do. Because if you don't, I'm gonna be takin' that fuckin' handsome head across the Bay Bridge with me. You got 48 hours. So, you gonna tell me who this Molly is then? I don't know, Frenchie. I don't know. One collection left. Let's just get it done and get the money to Tommy. This is it, here, isn't it? Let's take a look at the vig. This is it, 7044, mate. - Harley fucking Davidson, right? - Is that it, Frenchie? Oh, Christ. I tell you, I fuckin' hate this job. Yeah, but you're good at it. That's our cue, Frenchie. Perfect timing. Y'know what? Park the car over there by the alleyway. Let's get this done as quickly as possible, yeah? Whoa, whoa-whoa, wait a minute. What are you thinkin'? Look. I'm sick of gettin' in these punch-ups with these people, right? Let's just get it done quick, yeah? You make me nervous, Frenchie. Oi! Switch it off! - You guys need somethin'? - Cyrus Skinner. - He expecting you? - I couldn't give a fuck, mate. What'd you say? I said, we're lookin' for Cyrus Skinner, so be a good boy, run along and find him, before I kick the fuckin' shit out of you. It's OK! It's all right, Knuckle. Take a break from grindin' that bead. These lads are here to see me. - Come on. - Fuck off. Yeah, Tommy called me and told me that you two might swing by. Spoke to Tommy, that's good. So, you've rustled up the cash for us, then? Uh-uh. That ain't never gonna happen. I am not paying Tommy one fucking, red cent. The loan done died with the lender. Capisce? C'mon. You can understand that. It's OK, Frenchie. It's OK. I got it. Come on, Cyrus. What's wrong with you? Be nice. You know how it works, right? Loan was transferred and was reactivated, OK? You owe money. You don't get to keep the money. Yeah, well, y'know, I was really, really hoping that you two would not try to underestimate me. Well, listen to me, asshole. You've already spoke to Tommy, then we don't have to tell you who we are and what we get paid to do. No. I know. You fucking, English cunt! Do you really think you can intimidate me? You too, you little, fuckin' cocksucker! I was dealing with assholes like you, while you were still in fuckin' nappies! That's it! Fucking had enough. You're gonna go up there, and you're gonna get the money right now! Frenchie! What are you doin'? - Put the... - No, Sue! Shut up! What? You think this scares me? - Oi! Get back! - Frenchie, don't shoot. No, shut up, Sue! No! Fucking sick of this. You get up there, right now. You get the money. Fuck you! why don't you pull the fuckin' trigger? Get your money! Do it! Stop! Stay right fuckin' there! OK. OK, Cyrus, so... listen to me. You can tell me to go fuck myself, right? But be smart, 'cause right about now, your bones are all startin' to break. Floatin' in little pieces around your orbital. Soon you're gonna lose sight in one eye. Maybe lose a little cognitive reasoning. But that doesn't matter, Cyrus. Wanna know why? Because I'm gonna keep hittin' you. And you know what, Cyrus? One day, really soon, you're gonna be able to eat dinner through a straw. With one good eye. So, just tell us where the money is, hey? Come on. There you go. Knuckle. Go. Go to my office and... and get the bag. Go. Hey, Knuckle! Don't do anything stupid, all right? Good job with the, uh, non-violence thing, by the way. Doin' a real good job there, mate. Impressive. Are you kiddin' me, Frenchie? I had to do somethin'. You were gonna put a bullet in the old man. I wasn't actually gonna shoot him, was I? What, you think I'm a fucking psychopathic murderer? I was just tryin' to shit him up. Fucking running! Go after him! Give me the gun and go after him! Give me the gun! Go after him! Hey, come here! Ugh! Fuckin' hell. Jesus Christ! Gimme that fuckin' bag. Now! - Ugh! - Jesus Christ. What was that? Acrobatics? You in the circus? It's parkour, bro. I wanna be a stuntman. You should see me on a bike. Stuntman? Nah-nah, mate. Nah, that's a terrible idea. That's dangerous! You're lucky I didn't kick the shit out of ya. You just did. We good, Frenchie? Yeah, looks like we're good. Good. Let's pack it up and get outta here, yeah? Get it back to Tommy. He can give it to Molly. And we can put the whole fucking universe back into balance. Molly? You're talkin' about Barbosa's psychotic, fucking brother Molly? What'd you just say? If Molly's taken over Barbosa's loans, you two are so fucked. Sue, did you just hear what he just said? We've been collecting Barbosa's debts. I know, Frenchie. I know. - It's OK, it's OK, Frenchie. - We're fucked! - Tommy fucking set... - We'll talk about it outside! Tell you everything you wanna know. Outside. We'll be leaving you now, Cyrus. Yeah. You're gonna know pain soon, bro. C'mon, gimme the keys. French, you OK? Just tell me, please, that you didn't know that these are Barbosa's debts we've been collecting for the past two days. Just tell me that. I wasn't positive, Frenchie. Not at first. What the hell is that supposed to mean? I dunno, Frenchie. Tommy calls me outta the blue, he tells me he's got this gangster breathin' down his fuckin' neck and he tells me it's serious, yeah? Then he tells me he wants me to collect three vigs in 48 hours. He wants me to do it with you. Yeah? Nobody else. Just you. Specifically, just you! Then when that thug walked into the burger joint and mentioned Molly's name, well... what can I tell you, Frenchie? I started to put it all together myself. And you didn't think to tell me this before? C'mon, Frenchie, you understand me. I was lookin' after Tommy, OK? Besides, the only thing I do know is, if I told you, you wouldn't have helped me out. Right? If you knew, you wouldn't help me. Th-that I do know. - No, I wouldn't have done. - That's right. Do you know why? 'Cause I'm not fucking stupid, that's why! - C'mon, I'm sorry, brother. - Fuck off, mate! Frenchie, c'mon! Brother, you're.... C'mon, think about it. Wait a minute. We're three for three. We've a fuckin' three-run home stretch. Home stretch to what, mate? A den of fucking vipers? You're tellin' me that you're gonna risk your life for this guy? Yeah. I am. - Yeah? - Yeah. What the fuck's wrong with ya? 'Cause he's gonna fuckin' die, Frenchie. OK? And you don't know him like I know him. Just... Just calm down for a second, Frenchie. Just listen. OK, look. When leukemia took my little Milly, I lost everything, yeah? My wife. My life was goin' down the toilet. It was fuckin' done! It was fuckin' done! It was done. He was there for me yet again. You understand me? With you, I spent a weekend with you. Yeah. We busted some heads and I call you my brother. But you gotta understand what me and Tommy are to understand how I really feel. You with me? You gotta listen to me now. OK? Just listen to me. We should just do one. And get outta this shit right now. There's $250,000 in this bag, there's another $250,000 in the trunk of that car. I say we split the collection down the fuckin' middle and get out of here while we still can. Don't do it, Frenchie. OK, c'mon. Don't do it. Oh, fuck you, Sue! I'm doin' you a favor here, mate. Right? And I've earned this money, so I'm fuckin' keepin' it! Let go of the bag, Sue. I can't let you take the bag, Frenchie. Let go of the fucking bag, Sue. Make me. Ah, Jesus, Frenchie! I'm sorry, OK? Look. Ring's off, I come in peace, I didn't mean it, brother. OK? Why did you fuckin' hit me? C'mon, Frenchie. You fuckin' hit me... Uhh! OK. OK, that's it. Just, just give me the bag. - I'm not givin' you the bag. - Well you got to gimme the bag. - I'm not givin' you the fuckin' bag, Sue! - I'm taking that fuckin' bag. OK, just leave it. Just fuckin' stop! Frenchie, please, just c'mon. OK, c'mon please! I'm takin' that bag, Sue. Fuck! Damn. Now, what the fuck are these idiots doin' now? Remember that little conversation we had about MMA versus boxing? Yeah? I win. Aah! OK. Yeah? Y'know, I was tryin' to give you an easy way out with that choke, Sue. Know what I'm gonna have to do now? I'm gonna have to fuck you up. Hey, you know how many times I've heard that, Frenchie? What are you gonna do? Gonna kick me? Uhh! OK. Come on. Come on then. - Yeah? - Yeah! Come on then. Aah! Jeez, Frenchie, OK. Y'know I gotta be honest, Sue. Always wondered who'd come out on top, if it came down to it. Yeah? Y'know what? Me too. C'mon! That's for my coupe! C'mon. - Ah! - C'mon! Yeah, boss? Yeah, Tommy's boy handled his business. Shi... They doin' that to themselves right now. All right. We'll handle it. You sneaky motherfucker! Hey. I just want you to know somethin', Frenchie. I want you to know, there's no fuckin' way I can leave Tommy to die like an animal. Hope you understand that, yeah? What's up? Yeah? Damn. You boys done fucked up! I had money on you, Ninja. You owe me a slice now. Yeah, you're a couple of tough guys you lot, aren't ya? But it was us that got your boss' money back, wasn't it? So, there you go! Go on, take it! You can count on that, motherfucker. You go back there, you're a fucking dead man, and you know it. The money's yours. I'm takin' the truck. Frenchie. Don't worry about me. Just worry about the next two jobs. I'm sorry, I got you into this, Sue. That's OK, Tommy. You know? We go way back, yeah? I owe you for things. Right? You know how that goes. We've had a good run, Golden Boy. If I were you, and I got that money, I'd disappear. Run. Hey, Molly. Look who's come to visit. Fuck. Why'd you come back? That's far enough, motherfucker. Cutty, pour me a shot of that Rooster Rojo, will ya? My man, Sue. You got the J-U-ice. I say that for you. Where's your road dog? Mister Jiu-Jitsu. Lost his appetite for the job. So, he left you holdin' the bags, huh? Eh, guess so. Don't you ever listen? What the fuck are you doin' back here? See, your man Tommy, he lied to me, man. He said that you were dead. I mean, you look kinda fucked up but... y-you, you don't look dead to me, man. Actually, in Tommy's defense, I did die. Twice. So, you've been breathin' on borrowed air. Right, homes? Yeah, maybe so. Y'know, Molly, I returned your brother's bounty, right? So, about you take the cream off the vig, you let Tommy go, and we'll be on our way? What do you say? How's that sound, homes? Yeah? Go on, Tommy. You're OK. Get up. Tommy. Get up, let's go! Cutty. Shoot Tommy if he moves, man. Lemme ask you a question, Sue. Did you really think that you would ever be walkin' outta here a free man? Did you... did you really think that? Felix, get my fuckin' dough! Now, go ahead. Take your money. It's all your money, Molly. I don't give a fuck about your money. Come on! Don't you fuckin' move. Or I will blow her fuckin' head clean off! You listen to me, Molly. I ain't playin' games here. You got your money, you got what you fuckin' wanted. You let me and Tommy go. Real simple. Yeah? Shoot the fine bitch. You think I give a fuck? Some gangster shit. M.O.B. No offense, Felix. If you guys have a clean shot, shoot this motherfucker! You see, you just put your money on the wrong color, Sue. Fuck you, I'll do it! Fuckin' stay back you motherfuckers! Felix. Stay back! Stay back! Or I'll fuckin' blood you! Go ahead! You really are a gangster, aren't you? Big Bo, hold that for me, would ya? Sue, that... that must've hurt, man. Yeah, it did. Women, it's like they always go for our nuts. I know. You do know what's gonna happen next, all right? I got a pretty good idea, yeah. You may be a little scared. Yeah. Actually, I am. Aw, man. That's honesty. I like that. Hey, Molly. Barbosa set my boys up to die. I couldn't let that slide. So, yes, I shot that piece of shit brother of yours. And I'd do it again. See, it wasn't just business. I did it because he was an evil piece of shit! You think I don't know you set us up? Not after all the years. You'll walk the line before me. Finally, you tell me the truth. But about murderin' my brother... Ah, come on, Molly. It's me you want, not Sue! Let him walk outta here. It's no shame on you! I always knew that it was you. But now you're gonna suffer... watchin' him suffer. Cutty, hold that. You see this black beauty right here? She was trained in the School for the Americas. Where the most devious motherfuckers go to learn how to torture and do fucked-up shit. She knows things. I call her L.L. 'Cause she loves to torture. Hey. OK. Wow. Listen. I know we have this crazy connection. I see it, too. I do. I don't think now's the time or the... pla... time or the place. Know what I mean? - Now you bite the wood, Sue. - Y'know, Felix, I was thinkin' maybe you could bite mine first. Unless you wanna bite your own fuckin' tongue off, bite the wood, motherfucker! See, this is called the Tucker Telephone. They used it on unruly prisoners back in the Old South. A long-distance phone call. That's how they phrased it. Baby girl, light 'em up! Fuck! Bring him back. Fuck you! Yeah, suffering. Three... two... one. Don't fall asleep, Sue. I'll use the adrenaline again, and you don't wanna have a heart attack. Baby girl, make another long distance call. You don't have to do that either. Light him up. Everybody put your fuckin' guns down, now! Get down on the floor now! Oh, shit. Fuckin' Jiu-Jitsu I was tellin' you about. I think the odds are against you, mate! I wouldn't be too sure about that, mate. Drop your weapons! Don't wanna hurt anyone. Just want the money. Bitch in the purple. Get over there. Anyone fuckin' moves, stitch 'em to the wallpaper! A'right, you two in the back! Untie them, both of 'em! Untie them now! I'm not fuckin' about! I will shoot you. Think I give a fuck? I've been shot before. Places and faces, motherfucker. I'll find you. Gonna turn around and a 6'5" lightskinned nigga's gonna be right there. Bang-bang. Shut the fuck up and sit down. Best shoot that bitch, man. Fuckin kill 'em all! Get the fuck outta here, Golden Boy! I'll fuckin' drag you outta here if I have to. Get the fuck outta here! Go! Is that what you think? I'm gonna drag you outta here if I fuckin' have to, I didn't come all this way... Take the fuckin' money! No, no, no... No! Back up! Get down there! Eat lead, bitch! Go, go, go! Bite this, bitch! Eat this, motherfucker! Get up! let's move! Come on, Sue, let's go! Come on! You're gone now! - C'mon. - Now! You fucking wankers! Come on! Here's your money with interest! Jesus Christ, Frenchie, what'd you do? What have you done? I got her number of the vig. Made a deal to save your ass. - Get in! - Get in the car, Sue. - Get in the fucking car! - Ugh, Mal... Fuck. Well, I don't know, Frenchie, I'm thinkin' maybe I'm gonna head back towards Vegas. What, with that crazy bitch? Man, what can I tell you? We're gettin' along these days. Can you imagine? Why, she mellowed with age then? Yeah, maybe she has. Maybe she hasn't. Who knows? What I do know is that, uh, think it's time I bring a little balance into my life, yeah? Look, I'm sorry it didn't go the way we wanted it to with Tommy, mate. That's OK, Frenchie. No need to apologize. Not your fault, right? We did the best we could. Tommy was big boy, knew what he was gettin' into. By the way, you remember what I said about me and Tommy? Well, we go way back, you know? Way back. We've been through a lot together. But... me and him never went through what you and I went through. So, I want you to know somethin'. Anything you want, any time, anywhere, I'll be there for you. All right? It's funny you should say that, actually, because, um... Had an interesting phone call this mornin' from my old boss. He's got a mate who's settin' up a gig in the East coast. And he reckons that my temperament might be perfect for the job. Gonna head out there. You're welcome to join me if you want. You didn't have to take me up on it so quick, Frenchie. Besides, it's the East Coast. You know, uh, it's cold. - I got brittle bones, I'm an old man. - Yeah. I'm gonna head back to Vegas. It's where I need to be. - Oh, come on, mate. Come on. - Dry heat. It's the dry heat. No harm in seeing what they gotta say, mate. Yeah? Come on. Security or collection? Ah... more like collection, I think. Wait a minute. This is coming from a man who told me he hates the job. I do hate this job, mate, but it's like you said... I'm pretty good at it.
