Directed by: Koji Wakamatsu No, you're tickling me... - What? I'm doing nothing. - But still... - No! - What do you want, bastard? Go away! Oh, it's you, guys! Oh no, it's Yamazaki. - Yamazaki! - You surprised me. I guess you're used to do this kind of thing. But you're also doing dirty stuff, right? Peeking like that. Hey, come here a second. That Haruyo Wakabayashi is amazing. You're getting me in trouble. Do you want to do her too? You don’t know anything about women. This is a good chance for you. I am sure she will say “okay”, because she is not satisfied yet. I am fine. Next time, I guess. I don't feel like it now. Don't say that. I know you want to do it. - You are sexually frustrated, right? - It's not your business. No choice, then. Feel free to come in the morning if you still want it. I really want to fuck a woman. I cannot help it anymore. I don’t care what kind of woman she is. I really want to make her moan. If I really wanted to, I could definitely rape a woman or two, I am sure. That's right! I'll rape a woman! - Uhm... - Aren't you bothersome? I'm sorry... What are you doing? No! No! What are you do...? No! No... let me go! No... no! That hurts! But I cannot do anything right. I think it's weird that they are the only blessed ones. Why can't I fuck a woman? I wouldn't have to suffer like this, had the red light district still existed like it did in the past. Whether people like it or not, prostitution solves sexual frustration. Nowadays, we cannot buy women anymore. Come to think of it, our life is full of stimulation, but there is no place to release it at all. "From the point of view of the interests of either of these powerful groups," "they had nothing to recommend them." "I was convinced by the arguments of Wolf and I hardly approved of Wilson," "when he said there was such a thing as nation's being too proud to fight." "As of later, I approved of Charles Bird," "when he insisted in the beginning of the II World War" "that we had better let your opponent alone and set our own house in order." "The Germany of Hitler, to be sure, seemed more threatening than that of the Kaiser," "but I believe..." That's good. Next is Yamazaki. Hey, Yamazaki! What seems to be the problem? Huh? It's nothing. Please forgive me. - Continue the reading. - Yes... Well... where is it...? "American Library Weekly was founded..." "in 1914 and in the 20s, I began to write for it, and..." "even Charlie became one of its editors." "In the early days..." To be honest, I was surprised when Haruyo Wakabayashi told me to wait on the rooftop. No girl has told me such a thing before. But, at any rate, she is late. Why is she making me wait this long? Maybe I am being tricked. Is she making fun of me? I am getting angry. Actually, Haruyo Wakabayashi, is a disgusting public toilet-like whore who sleeps with anyone, so I don't like her. I'm sorry I made you wait! - Were you waiting for long? - Not really, no. Ah, I'm glad! I was worried that you would be angry, Yamazaki. So, what's the matter? Can you please not tell anyone about last night? In return, I will give you the knife you wanted. You know, the great knife my father used. You wanted that when I told you about it, right? - Will you really give me the knife? - Yes. I thought you would never come back. Don't get mad, don't get mad. Here, just like I promised. No way, it’s covered with rust. How frustrating. I am not sure I can actually use it. You are stupid, Yamazaki. A rusty knife is still a knife. Just sharpen it, that’s all. I am sure it can cut things very well. Do you think so? If you want, I can sharpen it for you. It's okay. I will do it myself. Hey, will the knife be enough? Huh? A knife is too cheap of a hush money. Don’t you think so? If so, stop looking at the knife. Hey, Yamazaki. Look at me. Hey, Yamazaki! Is there something wrong, Yamazaki? It's not that, but there's something... It's your first time, right, Yamazaki? That's why you're scared. That's cute. Let me be the one teaching you. Are you serious? That line seems to come from a dream. Don’t play innocent, Yamazaki. I love you. Yamazaki... How do you feel about me? Wait a moment. I love you, Yamazaki. Fuck me hard! Say, do you love me? - Answer me. - But...! That kind of thing... I only heard rumours about you, but you are actually incredible. Not really. I think I am average. - You are just inexperienced, that’s all. - I am confused. It doesn’t matter anyway. When I held the knife, I suddenly felt I became strong. I can do anything with this. I was engrossed with the knife. I started becoming addicted to the attractiveness of the knife. I was a little scared. But I was certain I became stronger. I have a knife! What a feeling! Amazing, just as expected. Sayuri Natsume was an English Literature student too. I had liked her. On a Saturday afternoon, I asked her out for a date because I knew she didn't have a class. Sorry for the sudden kiss. You surprised me, because I didn’t know you would do this kind of thing. Sorry, but I have liked you for a long time. And kissing is not a big deal, is it? But my mother won’t like that. Hey, why don't we go further? She will scold me if I come back home late. No problem. Let’s just take a little walk. I will walk you home after that. Don't worry. - Hey, let's go! - No! - It's okay! - Stop this! - Come on! - Hey, Yamazaki... - There's no problem. - Please forgive me. Stop, for real! - It's fine. - Stop, I don't want this! - Don't be mad! - No, no! - Come on, Sayuri! - Don't do it today! Do it next time! - Next time? When? - Hey, stop it! Hey, I am serious! Please don’t do it today! I don’t want to get pregnant! Stop it! - It's okay, you won't get pregnant! - Stop! Don't do it! No! I don't want to do this kind of thing! - It can't be helped! - But...! - I can't hold back anymore. - No, stop! But I... I am still a virgin! - Who cares? It's fine! - Stop it! What kind of girl nowadays keeps her virginity? I'm serious! Stop! I'll be in trouble! I'm scared! - Come on, now! - Stop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Forgive me. Seriously, Yamazaki! Stop it! That's enough! Stop it, get your hands off me! I beg you! Stop... Forgive me... I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Hey, what's wrong? Don't give me an upset look, Sayuri. I know you like me. If so, what's the problem? Also, we share the same class. We can become even closer, can’t we? Come on, enough is enough. Sex is not a big deal! Hey, please say something! Come on, aren't you saying anything? Ugh, you are making me mad. I am begging you right now. Say something, like yes or no! Damn it! You are totally ignoring me! Hey! Hey! Say something! Actually, it was very good, wasn’t it? How was it? What's so funny?! - Because... - Because, what?! Because I didn’t enjoy it at all. I guess you are that kind of guy, Yamazaki. Bitch! You made fun of me! I did it... In the end, I... I really did it... You have a scared look on your face. Why? Why? No reason. You are scared. I am not! Nothing can scare me anymore! I don't care even if the world collapses tomorrow! Oh my! You are talking big! But your face is saying the opposite. Your name is Shoko, isn't it? You sure are bold. If you make fun of me, you will get in trouble. Huh? What did you say? I couldn't hear you because of the loud music. If you make fun of me, you will get in trouble! Stop talking big! Have you ever raped a woman? - What? - Rape. I have! - So, can you rape me? - Of course, I can! You sure are strong! That’s right! Rape, murder... I can do anything! That's splendid! Where are you going, Hiroshi? I'm going to the toilet. I'm feeling sick, somehow. - Will you be okay? - I'll be fine. Are you okay? I feel better after throwing up. Where is the courage I saw earlier? Get it together. Ah, that's so bright! Oh, sister, you were there? - Who is she? - My sister. If you really want to rape me, I can act like a virgin before you do me. That's fine, but your sister... It's okay, she's asleep, anyways. Hey... {\i1\pos(836,552)}Dear Hiroshi, It was very good last night. I really want to be with you, but I have many guys waiting for me. "So, I have to run away today." "If you still want to meet me again, let's do it again soon!" "I will be waiting for the day when your crime is published in the papers." "Signed by Shoko." What is this? She is making fun of me! By the way, did I tell her about it? I don't think I did, though. I don't know anymore. Maybe I killed her in my dreams. It's so cold! Hey, let me get in, sister. It's too cold! Alright, go ahead. Huh? Are you naked? - Do you sleep without clothes? - That's right. I always do. Hey. Hey. Is it okay? Of course it is. Hurry up and do it. Say. One more round. Is that okay? What? I don't feel like it... What are you scared of? You are a man, so act like one. Get it together! This doesn't feel nearly as good as the sex with Shoko. I don't think having sex with a woman is supposed to be this lame. I was inexperienced when I had sex with Haruyo, but the sex with Sayuri was much better. Was this because I raped Sayuri in the end? Besides, I managed to kill her in the end. I knew it! If I want to have the greatest pleasure, I have to kill women. That's right, let's kill her. I have to kill her! Kill! I will kill you, women! Let me go...! What are you doing? Go away, pervert! I cannot kill them without a knife. Unfortunately, I cannot do anything without a knife. Knife... With a knife, I can... No! - Come on. - Stop that... - That's enough. - We can't wait. Give me a second here. I'll do it seriously this time! - Look at him. - I told you to stop... Shape up, you! Go easy on me now... - It hurts. - Oh, you! You're such a good girl! Come on, stop this... You idiot, idiot! Such an idiot! This is ridiculous! That fool... I guess the two women beat a guy just like that. This makes me mad! No more, no more! Enough, that's enough! Let's stop! You girls! Hey, good evening! What’s up, Hiroshi? Why did you sneak into the room? Because it was not locked. - Who the hell is this guy? - It's Hiroshi. He is incredible, even if he doesn't look that way. Huh, in what way? Anyway, he is much stronger than you. What's so funny, sister? Can you show me in what way you are strong? Stop that... - I am serious! - Why did you do it? There is no reason. I just do it because I want to do it! Stop it... don't do it... There is really no reason. If I have to pick one, I just want to show gratitude to women adoring me. I want to fuck them! I don’t like girls like Shoko. "Repeat molester in a national railway train?" "Decapitated high-schooler?" "And... murder of a married woman at an apartment?" Everybody does it too. I am not alone. No! - It's okay! - Stop now! No! - It'll be quick! - No! Come on, give me a break! No! Stop this! No! No! No! No! - I told you to stop! - Come on! - No! - Be quiet, will you? No! No! Somebody help me! No! No! - Shut up! - No! - Shut up! - Let me go! No! No! No! No! No! No! - It's fine! - No! Don't be so loud... No! No! Somebody help me! No! No! I told you to stop! No! You bastard! No! No! No! - Shut up! - No, don't! - Be quiet! - No! No! No! Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Mother! - Damn it! - No! No! - No! - Silence! No! No! No! - No! - Shut your trap! No! No! Mother! - You disrupted my business! - It's your turn now, buddy. Go ahead. - Are you already done? - Well, yes. It was good. Please go ahead now. Hey, buddy! - Help yourself. - Do it now. - What happened? - What's wrong? Do it already! We will be watching here, buddy. Come on! Come on! What is he doing? Maybe he's impotent? Huh? Hey, impotent buddy, hang in there! - Go for it! - Hang in there! Hey, she ran away! What a fool you are! - How unfortunate! - It really is! Hey, what happened? Can’t you do it? Who the fuck are you? Stop making fun of me! - Come down! - Sure, we will. Bastards! You were laughing at me, weren’t you? What? What’s wrong with that? Say it one more time! We can make fun of anyone whenever we want to! What happened, huh? You can’t even rape a woman properly. If you don’t stop now, you will regret it later! Searching for a fight? - Bring it on! - Are you serious? - Yes, we are! - Alright, then! Take this, you fucker! Damn it, you fool! Looking down at us! - Come here! - No way! I'll kill you! No, no, don't do it! Don't do it! You two were making fun of me! You fuckers! No, no! Running away, you bastard? Take this! But Sayuri Natsume’s incident was shocking. - Yes, it was. - What? Did something happen to Natsume? Don’t you know about it? She was killed. She was stabbed repeatedly with a knife and then buried. Really? I wasn't aware because I haven't read newspapers lately. The day before yesterday, it was published in the newspaper that her body was found, but two women and one guy were also killed in Shinjuku on that day. So, the article didn't get a big space. So, what about the murderer? Apparently, they have no clue at all. In any case, they found a shirt with the murderer's blood. By the way, the place where her body was buried was close to your dorm. In that case, you might be the murderer, Yamazaki. You liked her, didn't you? Are you kidding me? He has no courage to do such a thing. I guess so! I guess I haven’t read news for a long time. Don't they think that the Shinjuku murderer is the same guy? Impossible, the Shinjuku victims were kind of bar girls, while Sayuri Natsume was a good student. There is no connection between them. It could have been a random attacker. That might be possible for Sayuri Natsume, but not the Shinjuku murderer. No, apparently, it was a grudge murder. Also, apparently, the victims were bad girls. I read about another random attacker in the newspaper. Apparently, this guy rides a bike. Also, yesterday, two high-schoolers were attacked. Those guys at university sure talked about it a lot. I know they also want to do it. However, they don't have the courage. What are those guys scared of? Getting caught, perhaps? No, there must be something more than that, something that prevents people from doing what they want to do, something that restrains people. What the hell is that? I don't know, but I have to do it. Actually... Actually, I just... I just want women... That's all. But why do I kill people, then? What makes me do this? In the end, I wonder if having this knife is the problem? Without the knife, I wouldn't do such a thing. The girl who gave me the knife was the problem. It's not my fault! Haruyo Wakabayashi... Alright! I am going to call her and settle this once and for all! Why did you call me suddenly? What are you doing? Have you lost your mind, Yamazaki? No, let me go! Stop it, what are you doing? No... no... Did you call me for this? That’s disgusting, Yamazaki! No, I don't want this! That... that hurts! No, I don't want it! No, stop it! No, no... You're being bad, Yamazaki! No, let me go! Please, stop! What did I do? No, you're being bad! No! I don't want it! Stop now! No! No! No! No... let me go... No, I don't want it! You're bad. You're being bad, Yamazaki! Doing such a thing... What are you doing? Stop it, will you? Forgive me! I hate this place! Hey, Yamazaki! Please, let’s go to your dorm! Okay, Yamazaki? Forgive me. I don't want to do it here... No... I don't want this... No... no... No... no... I don't want it. Forgive me... No... no... Forgive me... forgive me... Let me go! Let me go! Come on, untie this rope. Let me go! It hurts, Yamazaki! Just let me go! You're so mean, Yamazaki! Please... Please, Yamazaki... What are you planning to do? Come on, answer me. Untie this rope! What are you doing, Yamazaki? Have you lost your mind? I hate you. Girls like you make me sick. Don't do such a crazy thing! Hey, Yamazaki! Think about it carefully. You are a good student with a bright future. If you do this kind of thing, your life will be over. Please calm down. Hey, do you know what you are trying to do? That’s too serious of a topic for a moment like this. Whatever topic you bring, it won’t work. You are trying to destroy your own life. Unfortunately, I have already done this several times. Sayuri Natsume and others, I killed them all! That can't be! I can't believe a good student like you did such things! Hey, Yamazaki! You are kidding me, aren’t you? What exactly is the problem? Is it money? If it is, my father will give you as much as you want. Spare me! - Please don’t kill me! - Are you scared of death? I'm scared! I'm really scared! So, please spare my life. You want to live that much? I will do anything, so I beg you to let me live. Impossible! I can't let you live! I'm dying... I'm dying... I'm dying... I'm dying... I'm dying... THE END
