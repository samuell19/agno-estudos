. Do you want some music? VYTAS Where are you? Call me. - Hello. - Hi. Have you seen the post? - Yeah. - Is he not answering? - Nope. - Do you know those chicks? - I don’t. - What are you gonna do? Dunno, I just texted him. I’m late for my doctor's appointment. And then I'm working. OK, stay in touch. If you hear anything, call me, OK? OK, stay strong. MUM Shit. Morning. You know your boyfriend damaged the door? - What door? - The entrance, downstairs. We didn’t want to call the police. Please fix it, it jams. Impossible to leave the building. - When did it happen? - Last night. I woke up from the noise and saw him smashing the door. Around 4 AM? Probably. It was bright outside. We couldn't sleep. And now the lock's broken. Fix it, we aren’t going to pay for your problems. OK, we’ll fix it. Thanks, bye. - Hello? - Why aren’t you picking up? - I’m in a rush, I can’t talk. - Have you seen the doctor? Going now, I can’t talk. - Don’t be late. - Fine. I hope Vytas comes with you? - It's not serious, no need to.- You can’t know. Call me later. - OK, fine. - Bye then. Morning. The door won't open. Fuck. JOIN THE FORCES - Hello. I’m here to see my doctor. - Your last name? Maria Zukauskaite. - Please wait, we’ll call you. - It's my slot now. Can't you see the queue? We’ll call you. Greiciute? Please come in. VYTAS FREEDOM Don’t sit on the floor. You're not in Africa. - Can I come in now? - We’ll call you, wait. Jankauskas. Lavrinovic. - I’ve been waiting for 30 min. - We're running late, wait. Why did I have to book? I’ll be late for work. There's nothing I can do. - Hi. Sorry I’m late. - It’s OK. Let me help you. Turn around. - My arm went numb. - Seriously? What happened? Nothing. I don’t know. - Maybe you've had a stroke? - Right... - Thanks. - Pleasure. - Thanks. - Thank you. Excuse me? Can we get some ketchup? Sure. Thanks. - Maria, leave your phone in the locker. - OK, sorry. - Hey, I’m at work. - He posted a new photo. What is it? With some guys by the river, near the chess tables. - When? - Just now. OK. - But you... Listen... - I can’t talk, I’m at work. - Should we call his doctor? - I can’t talk right now. - What’s up? - I really need to go. - What do you mean? - I have to, it’s very important. - Somebody died? - No. WTF, can't you see we're full? - Are you ready to order? - No, in a minute. - All good? - Yep. Fuck. I’m very sorry. It’s OK. I’ll do it, no probs. I really have to go. For fuck’s sake, you can't leave now. Sorry, I really have to. What are you doing? Maria? Hi, I'm at work. - What did the doctor say? - Nothing, the queue was too long. What do you mean? I didn’t see her. I tried to wait, but I had to leave. - Were you late? - No! You must see a doctor. I can’t talk, I’ll call you. I’ll call my doctor and ask her to see you. - No need, don’t call her. - OK, I’ll call you later. VYTAS Vytas! - Where did he go? - I don’t know. - Where?! - I don’t know. Cut the bullshit! - Stop yelling. - There, there… Leave him alone! Vytas! Vytas! - Hello? - You’ll need to slip out from work. The doctor will wait until 12.30 PM. Don’t be late and call me afterwards. OK? No, not OK. I asked you not to do it. - But you’ll go? - My phone’s dying. A SMALL TOWN MIRACLE - A 10 YEAR OLD BOY RESCUES HIS SIBLINGS FROM A FIRE Excuse me, I really need to talk about your patient Vytas Kazlauskas. - Has anything happened? - Yes. I really need to speak to you. I’m busy now, please wait. Can we do it now? I won’t keep you long. Excuse me for a moment. I don’t know what to do. He’s not well at all. He left in the night, I don’t know where. I’m worried something bad will happen. - You think it's psychosis? - Well, yes. Why do you think so? It’s impossible to reason with him. He's aggressive, like the last time. Now it’s even worse. How long has he been gone? He left at dawn, I couldn’t keep him in. And I can’t reach him. - He needs to be hospitalised. - Has he stopped taking the meds? Don’t know, probably. I see. So what do I do? How do I find him? There's not much I can do. Call his friends, someone might have seen him. Check the places he often visits. I’ll finish with the patient, and we can talk more, OK? OK. Thank you. VYTAS Hello? Fuck. Do you have an iPhone charger? Maybe you? Excuse me, do you have an iPhone charger? Excuse me, do you have an iPhone charger? Vytas called me but the phone died. - No, I don’t. - Maybe you have it? I have one. Damn, this won’t work. Excuse me, do you have an iPhone charger? No. Excuse me, do you have an iPhone charger? An iPhone charger, anyone? - Do you have an iPhone charger? - I don't. Hi, do you have an iPhone charger? Well, yeah. You've come all this way to charge your phone? Sorry, I was at the clinics, someone called me, but my phone died. You live nearby, so I came here. Sure, come in. An important call? No, just some issues. And who was calling? Doesn't matter. Who? It doesn't matter. Will you give it to me? - Sure, take it. - Come on, give it to me. Who called you? Vytas. He’s not well. I won't take long. What happened? It's back. What's back? The mania. Is he in the hospital? That’s the point, he’s not. What do you mean? I don’t know where he is. I need to find him so nothing bad happens. Can I help? There’s not much you can do. Want some tea? Coffee? Maybe water. Are you OK? His phone is off. Hey. - Hi, Pranas. - Hi. - I couldn't leave him with my mum. - Cool, we’ll go for a ride. What’s all this about? What? - You went to see Jonas? - I had to charge my phone. You keep in touch? I needed to charge my phone. That’s all. I was nearby. Fine. - What’s that about? - What? - Your lip. - Nothing. Let’s go. - Vytas did that? - Yeah. Seriously? He hit you? Fuck me. - Fucking hell. What the fuck? - Mum, stop! Wash your mouth. I’m sorry, Pranas. Fuck me!.. And we're looking for him? So he hits you again? Ona, he’s sick. - And you must be very well? - What should I do? What do I know? Shouldn’t you call the docs? Fuck, Ona. That’s why we're looking for him. - Maria! - Sorry, I’m really sorry. - Here, you can play. - I don’t want to. Take it, watch some Youtube. So where do we go? To the centre. He’s somewhere there. Drinking and telling everyone relationships are a capitalist fiction. Have you spoken to Petras, Andrius, Tomas? - Maybe they know something? - No. Maybe you should post something on Facebook? Definitely not. - Why? - Because. - But why? 'Cause I don’t want to fuck it up for him. - You know what they'll think. - What? That he’s a nutcase. No need to mention he’s not all there. And how will I come across? Like a dumped idiot? Pranas? - Pranas! - You swear too much. - I’m sorry, I won’t swear. - So do I. OK. - I did see him today. - Where? In the park, with the guys from the photo. - Did you talk? - No. He ran away. Ran away? - Yes, into the woods. - Into the woods? Like some Yeti? - You went after him? - What else could I do? MUM Does she know anything? - Hi, mum. - So how did it go? It was OK. - What did she say? - Nothing, everything’s fine. Meaning? I don’t know, she said it happens. It doesn’t happen to me. OK, mum, it doesn’t matter, she said I'm fine. What else did she say? I can’t talk, I’m at work. Why did you lie? - Otherwise there's too much to explain. - Explain what? Vytas is not well. He's gone missing, and we need to find him. Why isn’t he at home then? - His illness is different. - How? It doesn’t matter. We need to find him. So nothing bad happens to him. Do you understand? I do. How’s your arm? Dunno, it’s fine. - Stop here. - OK. - Do I go with you? - No, I’ll be quick. Hi. - Hi. - Oh, hey. - Has Vytas come by today? - No. Why? Nothing, just looking for him. If he pops in or you hear anything, call me, OK? Something's happened? He’s not well. How do you mean? You know how he's sometimes. Oh… I see... Shit. - So call me or text me, OK? - Yeah, sure thing. What a shame… Such a smart guy. Maybe he's overdone it with the thesis. Meaning? It’s cool - him getting the PhD so young. But look what happened. - I don’t think it’s related. - I think it is. You know, it’s a blessing and a curse. Maybe, I don’t know. Please don't get offended. You're amazing for doing so much… I must go, the car is waiting. - What did he say? - That Vytas is a smart nutcase. - What does that mean? - No idea, ask him. - To the Art Centre? - Yeah. Vytas is super talented. But this thing is dragging him down. Isn't it dragging you down? Stop here, I’ll ask if he’s been there. I’ll wait over there. Hi. Maybe you've recently seen this guy? He's been here. Why? Something's happened? I'm looking for him. Any trouble? Anything strange? What do I know, he was drunk. Was he alone? With some chicks. But he talked to everyone. Saying what? - Some gibberish about freedom. - Like what? Something about the need to be free, and it being the meaning of life. He was wasted, that’s all. Do you know those chicks? They looked familiar. Why? Is there a problem? Binge drinking? You could say so. I’m just looking for him. I see. Not much I can help with. - Maybe you need something? - No. Thanks. - What if I get you a drink? - No need. Just a shot. One sec. There you go. Cheers. Thanks. No worries. And? He was there last night, but that's about it. Damn. - Maybe we call the police? - No. Why? It hasn't been 24 hours yet? Not the point! I don’t want him sectioned. It’s not fair. Say you find him, how do you take him to the hospital? - I’ll persuade him. - Oh, right? - What else do I do? - Call the police. For fuck’s sake! Sorry, Pranas, I apologise. - And now? To Uni? - Yeah. - You think he’ll be there? - I don’t know. Wait here. - Maria? Hi. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. I was thinking about you today. I found a book at home - it'd be useful for your research. - Great, thanks a lot. - I’ll leave it in the department. - Remind me, if I forget. - Sure. Sorry, I have to go. Pardon, do you have a minute? Excuse me. What happened? Sorry to interrupt, I'm Vytas's girlfriend. He's not well. What do you mean? He’s not well and won’t be able to come. He asked me to apologise. What happened to him? He's fallen ill. Strange. I know nothing about it. It happened yesterday. He would have called you. I see. Thanks for letting me know. I could present his paper. Professor, should we take seats? - Kazlauskas is ill. - How come he's ill? I've just been informed. But he's just called me. - When? - 15 minutes ago. - What did he say? - Not much. He’s on his way and might run a bit late. I’m going downstairs. Vytas might be coming. Excuse me. MUM VYTAS Let’s go. Petras called, Vytas is with him. - Sorry, he ran away. - Where to? I couldn’t hold him. He said he's going to Uni. Go there. Vytas! Vytas, let’s go home. - Who’s that? - It doesn’t matter. Enough, let’s go. - What’s happening? - Let’s go. - Fuck, Vytas! - Is that your girlfriend? I've got no time for this nonsense. - Where are you going? - To read the paper. - In such a state? - What state? It's not a good idea for you to go there. Bugger off. Where’s my car… You gonna fucking drive? - Leave him alone! - Go home. He doesn’t want to talk to you! Does he look OK to you? Fuck yourself, loony! What's wrong with you?! Idiot! Are you sick in the head? Retard! Go fuck yourself. Go away. Bugger off. - Let’s go to Uni. - Why? You saw him? Yes, he went there. It’ll be a total fuck up. - How did he look? - Not good at all. - I’m sorry, I couldn't hold him. - It’s fine. Was he alone? No. Fuck. - We’ll wait here. - OK. And to others - like criminals. In the current context of memorial wars, we must admit that the very subject of partisan warfare has not been researched with sufficient diligence. Therefore, further historical research in this field is vital. The only way to navigate this field is to do academic work in its purest sense, as opposed to dismantling heritage plaques from buildings. Thank you for attention. We thank Vladas Liepuonius for the paper. Since the time is pressing, we invite Vytas Kazlauskas. His subject is "Forgotten by History - Women Partisans". Excuse me. It is not at all new that the interest in the armed anti-Soviet resistance movement - or simply partisan warfare - has increased. More researchers are embarking on multidirectional research of this topic. Yes, on one hand, this intensification… is related to the heightened threat from Russia and the quest for patriotic awareness, thus uniting our fractured society. However, this also springs from the academical ambition to work the virgin soils of the past. The cases of the scandalous novel "The Green" by Ivaskevicius, and renaming the streets bearing partisan names demonstrate how these two directions intertwine. Society wants a true explanation of the historical situation. Simultaneously, it creates and defends the symbols that urge to mobilise... Only by bringing back women into history will we have a comprehensive picture of the armed resistance in Lithuania. Thank you. - What happened? - Go after Vytas! - What happened to you? - Nothing, please, run. Damn, are you injured? Not sure, something’s not right. - What happened? - Where did he go? - What’s wrong with your arm? - I don’t know, it went numb. Try to move it. I can’t. Shit, it's like a rag. Do you feel anything? Bollocks. That’s it, we are going to the hospital. My dad had a stroke, his arm looked like yours. Can it happen to young people? I know a guy who had a stroke. A few years ago, he was only 23 or so. - I’m not having a stroke. - How can you know? Close your eyes and try to touch your nose. Stop it. - Can’t you touch it? - I’m not touching it! Fine, then repeat this: "It’s very cold today, it might snow in the evening." Maria? It’s cold, it’ll snow in the evening, it might. - Wrong. - What? You said it wrong. It doesn't matter, it's all the same! Maria… “It’s very cold today, it might snow in the evening“. Pranas, everything’s fine. Hey, old man, don’t cry... Look. I’m not having a stroke. You have to close your eyes. Hello, my friend might be having a stroke, her arm went numb. - Where is your friend? - Here. I see. Take a seat, wait and fill in this form. - You should do something! - Fill in the form. She's not having a stroke, don’t worry. - How do you know? - Don’t forget to return the pen. - How long do we need to wait? - See the people ahead of you? - Maybe we can jump the queue? - You can’t. You will be called. Fuck. One can die waiting. If you do, we’ll bury you. - WTF? - Let’s go and take a seat. - Can you fill this in? - Sure, sorry… Don't. Hello. She might be having a stroke, but we were told to wait. Could you examine her? - We have a small child with us. - What happened to the child? Nothing, he’s waiting. She can’t move her right arm. It’ll be fine, we’ll call you. I need to use the bathroom. Fill it in, we’ll be right back. Let's go. - Date of birth. - 10 March 1990. Last name Zukauskaite. What do I write? Right arm went numb? "A stroke". I'll put "Right arm went numb". Maybe he's just gone a binge? Seriously? No way. No way. Well, maybe. Hey, listen, it'll be fine. He’s a great guy. And he really loves you. VYTAS'S MUM I’ll be right back. - Hello?- Hello, Maria. - Hello.- Vytas called me. What did he say? Where is he? He didn’t say, but I understood that he's on the edge. How are you? I’m fine, trying to find him. I don't think you should be looking for him. What do you mean? There's not much you can do. Don’t torture yourself. Meaning? You should take care of yourself. He pushes himself to the edge, and everyone suffers. I can’t talk right now. Of course. But you are young, take care of yourself. Thank you. I have to go. Bye. Hello? Maria? - Is everything OK? - Not really. - Have you called him? - Yeah. - Is that your dad? - Yeah. - Hello. - Hi. - How long you've been waiting for? - For over an hour. - Petras. - A friend of Vytas. - Where’s Vytas? - At work. - What's taking so long? - There’s a queue. We tried to talk our way through. It didn't work. - I’ll have a word. - Let's wait. Wait here, I'll be right back. - Let’s go. - Where? To a private clinic. No point to wait. What's with the lip? Nothing, I split it. How? With a door. By an accident. How come? - You hit yourself with a door? - Yes, I hit myself with a door. More details, please. I pulled the door handle with my right hand, hit the lip, there was blood, but now it’s fine. At 27 you still don't know how to open a door? You haven’t taught me. How is Vytas? What do you mean? What is he so busy with? He’s preparing a paper. He couldn’t take a break? His friend could drive you, but Vytas couldn’t. - Does it seem alright to you? - Dad, he’s not well. - Again in the hospital? - No. - So where is he? - I don’t know. I've spend all day looking for him. Are you going to spend your life like this? Send me his picture, I’ll ask my boys to look for him. Like how? - The patrols could help you search. - No. You can’t do that. Why not? He needs to be found. Yes, but you can’t detain a person if they don’t want it. - Why? - It's a basic human right. Fine. So it be. Why is there so much military transport in the city? I don’t know, maybe the war has started. - So? - Why are you here? Dad called me. What did they say? Everything’s fine. The results will be in an hour. You've exhausted yourself. I called the doctor, she said you didn’t show up. I couldn’t, don't you get it? I don't. You could have taken a break? No. Enough you two. Let’s go to eat something. You go, I’ll wait. - What have you eaten today? - Dumplings. With pork cracklings? Yes, and sour cream. And you? Dressed herring with Russian salad. And blood sausages. Very funny. Let’s go and eat, I suddenly feel like dumplings. I’d like a kebab. She’s already bought a ticket. Leaving for London next week. For good? Maybe she’ll get bored and come back in a month. Is he English? No, Turkish. That’s the worst bit. What so bad about it? Maybe he’s a good man, you can't know. I’m not saying anything. Ausra is terribly worried that he won’t let her leave. You know how they are. Nonsense. She's fallen in love. That’s great. Not at all. It’s normal for mothers to worry. You better wouldn't. We'd all live in peace. Where’s Vytas? He’s busy. Isn't he worried about you? OK, don’t start. I can't get what’s the use of a man like that. He’s not well. Not well at all? Yes. Why didn’t you tell me? Now I’m the bad guy. It's fine. I’m sorry. Mum, everything’s fine. I just feel so sorry for you two. You are too young for this. We did not find any foci of multiple sclerosis or malignancies. Your brain is clear. Nothing dangerous is showing up. I've written a referral for more tests. You should rest and avoid stress. So her arm went numb because of stress? We’ll learn more after we make more tests. As I said, the MRI scan didn’t show anything. It could be a caught nerve, it might be psychosomatic. What should we do now? The tests are next week, and for now she should rest. OK? OK. How’s your arm now? I don’t really feel it. - Do you feel my touch? - Yes, a little. You should be selfish and take good care of yourself. Don’t stress, get enough of sleep, eat well, right? - Is that all? - Yes. How should we do it? Do I pay here? - You pay at the desk. - I see, thank you. That doctor was strange. Looks very incompetent. - Let’s go, I’ll take you home. - You go, I’m going to Ona’s. What? - We’ve agreed to meet. - No, you need to rest. Fine, I’ll rest at Ona’s. You won’t rest there. You’ll run around looking for Vytas. Fine, I’m going to Ona’s. Stop it. The doctor said you must rest. You said she looked stupid. Quiet. I didn’t say "stupid". Incompetent. Same thing. Why all this nonsense? OK, you two, enough. One moment. - Maria! - I really have to go. Maria! Wait! And what's all this? Metal. Not only the buildings are dull, but the garages are still here. Everything’s from 1919. We should do something about it? To keep up a little. And now - cars, cars, cars everywhere... SAVICKAS IS CROWNED WORLD'S STRONGEST MAN FOR THIRD TIME Hi. This is Nojus. - He’s very sweet, looks like you. - Really? He reminds me of Putin. I hope he’ll grow out of it. - Should we take a small walk? - Yeah. - Listen, Vytas isn't well. - I got it from Facebook. He called you? Came over? I haven’t spoken to him for a year. - Has he gone missing? - Yes, he left home at dawn. His phone is either off or he’s not picking up. Shit. Have you tried posting on Facebook? What? That I’m looking for him? Yes, people could share. I don’t know, I don’t really want everybody to know. - OK, but he’s really not well. - Yes, very. So… Have you ever done that? No, back then Facebook wasn't a thing. - Any ideas where could he be? - Not really. I thought you might know something. You’ve known him for ages. No idea. We haven’t been in touch. What should I do? Don’t know, if you don’t want to post it... Honestly, no idea how I could help. That's why you're here? You could have called me. I was nearby anyway. What’s up with your arm? Nothing, I sprained it. Do you want me to look for him with you? No. I just... I don’t know what to do. Sorry, you’ll have to deal with it on your own. I’ve done my share. I don’t even want to remember it. I’m truly sorry for you. Hi! If anyone has seen Vytas last night or today, please contact me. Due to psychological issues he can be dangerous to those around him as well as himself. If you see or know anything, please call me. Hello? Hi, what’s up with Vytas? Nothing, he’s not well. I’m looking for him. First time? Well, not really. I just have to find him. Should I share the post? Don’t. It's better only friends see it. OK then. What does he have? He’s bipolar. He’s having a manic episode. What happens when he has mania? I can’t talk now, just Google it. WTF??? Sounds bad. Can I help? Stay strong… Wassup? How r u? Vytas owes me... - Hello?- Hi. I’m calling because of Vytas. What happened? Well, he’s ill. He has mental health issues. Wow, damn. Where is he now? I don’t know, that’s why I wrote that post. If I can help you, let me know, OK? Right, OK. When he's not well - does it last long? See, I’m thinking about my wedding… I don’t know. I’ll let you know when I can. It’d be great to know ASAP. We're planning... As you can see, I'm fine. Some people like to give improbable diagnoses. Good luck and have a nice evening. - Hey. - Hey. What's up? Nothing. Are you OK? - Can I come in? - Yes, sure. - What’s up with your arm? - Nothing, I sprained it. How’s Vytas? Is he back? No, but he seems to be alive. Well, that’s a relief. Would you like anything? Tea, coffee, Coke, water? There's some beer. And wine. Red or white? Rose. - Want some? - Maybe a beer. Sure. - So what’s going on? - A Coke? Why not? - I'll be drinking alone? - Come on, Maria. Let’s have a beer. I still have to do some work. I'm interrupting you? No, you're not. I just don’t want a beer. What’s going on? Nothing, I just wanted to have a beer with you. - I mean Vytas. - Oh. Nothing. I wrote a post. - Maybe I'll share it? - Don't. Who’s she? I don’t know. - Are you upset? - No. - You just came to say hi. - Yeah. - Have you told him anything? - About what? Come on, maybe that's why he's worse? No way, it happened ages ago. Actually, not that long ago. Don’t worry, it’s not related. Not that I'm worried. What do you want from me? - What do you mean? - What do you need? What’s wrong with you? I just don’t understand you. I do not need anything. If I’m interrupting, I can leave. - I just wanted to have a chat. - A chat? Seriously? Yes! So talk to me! Talk to me. Where are you going? What's up? - You’ve deleted the post? - Yeah. You're alright? Fine. - I've made a decision. - About what? - I’ll join the forces. - What do you mean? As a volunteer. Maybe I’ll find a husband in the army. - When? - Starting autumn. - I've passed everything. - Passed what? The medical, physical checks. - When? - Not so long ago. Seriously? Are you pulling my leg? Well, no, I’ve been wanting to do it for a while. - How long is it for? - Nine months. And what about Pranas? - Easy. - What do you mean, easy? He'll stay with my folks. How dare you? - Damn, I thought you’d be glad. - Glad about what? What do I know. - Pranas is also super glad, right? - In what sense? I don’t get it. You gonna lecture me? He’s a big boy, he understands everything. Very big. Fuck growing up with a mother. What’s wrong with you? I’m not leaving for good. - I’ll be visiting him. - Visiting? Like his dad? OK, let’s stop this. - Your reaction is totally crazy. - How is it crazy? Do you get what you're doing? - What am I doing? - Always thinking only about yourself! Maria! Maria. Maria, wait. Where are you going? - Where the hell are you going? - Hello, ladies. - Do you have a minute? - I don’t speak Russian. - Sorry, maybe English better? - I can‘t talk now. - Why? - Because. Maria! - We are looking for some cool bar. - Good luck. - Maria! - Can you just fuck off? Good evening, I came to collect the book. Hi, I could’ve left it in the department. I was nearby so I thought I’ll drop by. OK, wait a moment. - You can have for as long as you need. - Thanks a lot. Could I have some water? Sure, come in. - I can only offer you tap water. - That's fine. What’s with the arm? No clue, it started going numb. Have you heard Vytas’s paper? Yes, it was very good, as usual. - You liked it? - Yes, a lot. Maria, how can I help you? - But I'm fine. - Really? Can I sit here a little? While I finish the water? - Want a smoke? - I don’t really smoke. Neither do I. Finish it. One lager. VYTAS'S MUM What rubbish did you write on Facebook? Everyone's been calling me about it. I deleted it. So what? Everyone has seen it. Now they'll think that he’s some loony. You disappointed me very much. Where is he now? I don’t know. But everything will be fine. What will he do now? When everybody knows. You should’ve left him alone. Now nobody will want to work with him. He’ll get better. I’ll take care of that. What will you take care of, dear? Hello? Maria? Fuck off! What’s wrong, wanker? Fuck off, go home! I can’t talk right now. - We’ll come to Vilnius tomorrow. - OK, speak soon. - Leave me alone. - Fuck off! - Relax! - You relax, stop fucking about! None of your fucking business. Jealous? Crazy jealous. - You crazy bitch. - Miss, please leave. - What did I do? - Piss off! - I’ll walk you. - He started, what did I do? That's my beer, see? I’ll finish it and leave, OK? One "Stella". One more beer for me, please. - Where are you from? - Ukraine. Cool. - Where is your friend? - What friend? We saw you on the street. We were in the car, remember? Oh, that was you. So you left your friend? Yeah, I don’t know where she is. - Thank you. - It’s on me. What? Why? Because I’m from a poor country? Yes, it’s like a gift from my country to yours. OK. I’ll get another one for you. There is this kind of pain, when, let's say, if you lose your arm or leg, you can still feel it. Some people go to the doctors and say they have pain in that arm, but nobody can help them because they don't even have it. How is it possible? I don't know, it has something to do with the nerves, or something like that? It's true, I read about it online. - Let’s dance. - No. - C‘mon. - Believe me, I‘m a bad dancer. Hi. Everything's OK? Can you help me? Hello? OK, we’ll be right away. They've found him. - Here? - Yes. I’ll need your signature. How are you? I need to go to the hospital. So let’s go? Let’s go. Wait in the car, I won’t be long. - Where are you going? - I’m not going anywhere with you. We've agreed. How dare you? Am I a criminal? Sorry! I didn’t know what to do. You're not well! - You're not well! - Vytas, wait. Leave me alone! Leave, for fuck’s sake! I hate you for what you’ve done to me! - Let’s talk! - You planned it all very well! What have I planned?! I realised it as soon as I saw the entrance locked. I've seen the police at the conference. You wanted everyone to think I’m a loony. - What are you talking about! - You had it all planned! - You need to go to the hospital! - You go there! Of course I need to! I’m barely walking! - Who’s there? Who are they? - I don’t know, some guys. - What do they want? - I don’t know them. You're lying. They are coming for me. I haven’t planned anything. I just want you to get better. Please, let’s go. Fuck off! Vytas! Call the ambulance! He jumped in front of me. Call the ambulance, fuck! Let's pull him out! You go there. We can't pull him out. Call the ambulance! Lift the car… Vytas... Stay. Hello. I’m here to see Vytas Kazlauskas. His doctor wanted to see me. The doctor is out at the moment. But he might come back. Could I see Vytas? Better not, you won't be able to talk with him. - He is sleeping now. - So let him sleep. Could I still see him? Well, come in. You won’t see much. Thank you. OK, which ward is it... I’ll zoom in. Thank you. Soon everything will be fine.
