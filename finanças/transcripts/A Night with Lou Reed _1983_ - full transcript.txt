(electric guitar intro music) - [Narrator] Lou Reed came from these streets. In the mid-'60s when rock music was in euphoria over love and peace and flowers, Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground's terrain was the hard and raw city.

great. - [Man] There's a camera on. - [Woman] I can't believe, it was just fantastic. - [Man] There's a camera on. - I know that, they told me before. It was even better than the other one. - [Man] Yeah, I felt it, almost got carried away. - [Man] That was better than the other one. - [Man] Killer set. - [Man] Mr. Reed, unbelievable. - [Man] Well-done, it was a killer. - This particular show happens to be the type that you very rarely run into and, you know, the most you could ever hope for is that somebody out there had an audio cassette. So I am getting a big laugh out of the fact that this thing is actually videotaped. Did you videotape it? - [Man] Recorder was on all night. - I hit one note that actually caused me to levitate about 1/2 a foot. - [Man] On the guitar? - Yeah. I think, I'm not sure whether it was pain or pleasure that did it, but it was such a strong sound. It was feeding back and I was following its angle, as it were. It was going that way, so I went with it, you know. If I kept following it, I would've ended up on some table out there.
