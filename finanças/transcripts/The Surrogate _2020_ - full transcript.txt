And it wouldn't be a normal day here in los angeles if our photographer didn't catch up with a star like ava von richter seen here getting out of her car in front of spago's. Miss von richter hasn't had a hit in quite some time, but she's still popular with the paparazzi. Moving on, another celebrity doctor, chibi goldenhangler checked herself - in covina last night. - Babe, I'm so sorry. - I gotta go. - Ryan: Are you sure? Yeah.

You know what, never mind. Don't answer that. - Okay. - I'm letting you go. No. Look, avery, um, I-- I know that I've been late a couple times, but just... Thirty-six. Thirty-six? Really? Wow. That seems like a lot. That's because it is! Well, come into the - for the week. Don't let anyone see you. - Make people sad. - Thanks. Um, okay. Well, hey, I'm--I'm really sorry again. And if--if you ever need anybody to, like, pick up a shift - or something, I'm totally... - Oh, I won't. - How long can I... - Hey. Oh. Just one second. This is her. Hi. Listen, we need to talk. This is cristina. She's going to be living here from now on. That's cool. I mean, this apartment's pretty small. She's gonna be living here... Instead of you. - What? - Come on, liv. You haven't paid a rent in six months. Yeah. I--I told you I'll pay you back. Come on. I just got to pick up a couple more shifts. Yeah. You said that four months ago. Look, I know. I know things have been a little slow, but you know what, um, here, um, um, these are-- these are my tips from the last week. Just take them. - They're yours. - Look, I just--I cannot do this with you anymore, liv. I'm sorry. I know you lost your parents and whatever, but I can't be the one who is always taking care of you. There's always something. You can't live here anymore. Fine! Whatever. You know what, this--this apartment smells weird anyway, like--like, curry and--and clams. Clam curry. Hi. Who is it, babe? Hey, I thought you had work. Are you kidding me? What the hell is wrong with you? God, not only... Did I just get fired from that stupid job, but gina, the world's most boring roommate, she just kicked me out of my apartment. And I have no money because I stupidly gave all my tips to that bitch. And now this? This? - I'm gonna murder you. - Hey, hey, relax, - relax, relax. - Don't touch me! I didn't think you'd be this dramatic. Look, I'm sorry, liv. I didn't think - we're that serious. - That serious? We've been dating for over a year. You took me to your brother's wedding! I have a fricking drawer here. Oh. I do, too. Look, liv, I don't need this kind of stress in my life right now. I have a fake casting today. You get that, right? Yeah, I'm really sorry about your mom, by the way. We've been so lucky she's in an incredible facility. But enough about that, I think that I have... A very unique and very lucrative opportunity for you. I'll take it. My employers, they are very high profile and very private. So first and foremost, we're looking for discretion. Oh. I can do that. I can be totally discreet. So, the couple that I work for, more than anything, they want a baby. Unfortunately, the wife has been struggling with infertility and they're looking for a surrogate, someone to carry the embryo and they're willing to pay a very, very generous fee for this. A hundred and fifty thousand. A hundred and fifty thousand? Wow. Okay. All you have to do is come to l.A., meet them, and you can go from there. You did say that you were looking to get out of town. Yeah. I know it's a lot to think about. But why don't you sleep on it and we can talk it about in the morning? Okay. Okay. I will. Don't think for too long.

It's totally fine. I am so sorry. I didn't mean to touch anything. It's okay. No. Seriously. I--I'll replace it. It's totally fine. This is crazy. I just-- I just saw you on tv. Now I... Olivia, take a breath. I swear it's fine. It's okay. I should have gotten rid of that a long time ago. I mean, who wants to be reminded of the time they broke their ankle mid rumba on national tv? - Wow. - You okay? Yeah. Um, well, it's very nice to meet you, mrs. Von richter. Oh, god. Please call me ava. Mrs. Von richter makes me sound so old. Okay. Well, it's nice to meet you, ava. Hmm. Sit. Oh. Um, okay. How about a drink? I know I could use one. Um, yes, please. Just whatever you're having is great. Well, I'm really having a japanese whiskey moment so I hope you like hibiki. I love it. - Thank you. - Uh-hmm. Cheers. To embarking on this incredible journey together. Uh-hmm. - Ladies. - Hmm? Hmm. Hayden von richter. Uh, olivia. Nice to meet you. So, catch me up. How was your flight? How's your drink? Do you wanna have our baby? Remember no pressure, babe. We want olivia to feel a hundred percent comfortable. Of course. Of course. Forgive me, olivia. My sense of humor can sometimes be, um, lost in translation, I think, that's what doctor hunches said. Hmm. I'm told I can muck things up. - Right, dear? - I think what hayden is trying to say is that we wanna make sure this decision is best for you, not just for us, but we are willing to provide anything that you might desire. Oh. Look, thank you. That's--you guys are very nice. I did a--a bit of research on the plane regarding surrogacy, but, uh, it was a little bit... Overwhelming? Yes. Overwhelming. We understand. Um, as of now, we have three embryos. That's three fertilized eggs. Three opportunities to really have a baby and our fertility doctor is one of the top doctors - in the country. - One of my oldest friends, - basically family. - Ava: Unfortunately, my body tends to attack the embryo. So, I'm not able to carry it my own. As our surrogate, you will undergo fertility treatments to prep your body so that the egg can be implanted in the uterus. Also, my fertility journey doesn't need a play-by-play on tmz. So, we will require you to sign an nda, not only to protect us, but to protect you as well. Olivia? Olivia? Are you okay? - What? Um, yes. I'm sorry. - - Okay. I think that's about enough for now, babe. Maybe we should just show you to your room? Yes. That would be great. Thank you. You must be exhausted after that long flight. Oh. Another thing, olivia, whenever you're hungry, uh, chef peter will be happy to make you anything you want. Okay. Well, let's get you settled. Give you time to digest all of this. - Okay. - Cassidy, please show her to her room. Hmm. I was gonna heat up some lasagna, but... Hmm. Oh my god. I'm sorry. But if you're good with these naturally and artificially flavored, processed breakfast pastries then don't let me stop you. Um, no, lasagna sounds great. Thank you. All right. I'm olivia, by the way. I'm the von richter's... Yeah, I know who you are. And you must be peter, their personal chef? - Yeah. - Well, working for them must be really something. I mean, this place is insane. There were, like, 30 buttons just to flush my toilet. Hmm. - Thanks. - Peter: Uh-hmm. Hmm. This is so good. Thank you. So how long have you been working for them? A bit, actually. A bit, huh? How official. That's enough, ava! I'm done. - God, I hate you! - Hayden: I'm off! I hate you! Olivia, wait! Hey! Hey. - Hi. - You, uh, you need something? Uh, no, I'm okay. Hey, petey, give us some of that bellini, huh? One for me and one for my very special guest. - Hmm? - Uh, no, I'm actually-- - I'm okay. - No, I insist. I insist. It's a celebration. - Uh-hmm. - Right, petey? Huh? Well, um, bottoms up, hmm? You all right? Yeah. I just--I wanna say that it's great that you're here, right? Thanks. You and ava have been really, really nice and your house is beautiful. You're gonna be... Great. You're gonna be great, hmm? Just great. Isn't she, petey? Yes, sir. When you're young and you're so hot, I mean, we could-- we could use some of those farm fresh eggs. Right, petey? Hayden, it's time for bed, my love. Good night to all. And to all, good night. This was great. I'm just gonna take this. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Good night, ava. - Good night, olivia. Oh! Good. You got my gift. - Yeah. - It was my great grandmother's. I used to visit her when I was young. She wasn't very flashy. She was actually quite simple, but she wore this locket every day until the day she died. When I visit, she would let me wear it. Same story every year. There was a war, and my great grandfather, and the lucky necklace that saved his life. And I loved it. I loved the story. I don't get it. I mean, this necklace is so important to you. Why would you let me wear it? 'Cause it's time to pass on the luck. I have everything I could ever want except a baby on my own. And you could bring us that blessing with a little luck. I'll do it. You'll do it? I would love to be your surrogate. I would love to carry your baby. Oh. Thank you. Here. It looks beautiful on you. Thanks. Thank you. Hey, you ready? As I'll ever be. Good girl. You know, it takes a little adjusting. No. I mean, ava is very high profile. It's a necessary sacrifice. Exactly. And it's for your protection too. We don't need anyone in their business, you know? But--and I'm totally fine with this, I swear. But what if I need to call someone for, like, an emergency or something? Who would you call? I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to come out that way. I just kind of thought that you are on your own with your parents being, you know. And you said your boyfriend was kind of a real jerk, right? Yeah. You know what? You're right. I don't know who I'd call. But, hey, you're here now. Things are gonna be really good. Whirlwind starts tomorrow. See you later. Other side effects you might experience include severe nausea, weight gain, and extreme exhaustion. It's great. Thanks, jerry. - Morning. - Morning. Who was that? Ava's green juice delivery every morning 6:15 a.m. What are you doing up? I think the hormones are making it hard to sleep but, hopefully, it'll all be worth it. If it's what you want. Of course it's what I want. Like, hayden and ava have been beyond generous with me. It's the least I can do. So you've really thought this through? What it's gonna be like? Peter, I have met with more doctors in the last month than in my entire life. Believe me, I can't stop thinking about what it's gonna be like. So you're telling me that you're ready to carry someone else's baby for nine months, and then just give it up to two people who probably don't even-- all I'm saying is, it's a pretty big decision you've made. You're right. It's a really big decision. But hayden and ava deserve to have a baby and I can help them do that, and I want to. I wanna help them. Okay then. Haven't you ever wanted something that maybe wasn't easy for you? Why do you think I'm here? What do you mean? Well, goal was to open my own place. Oh. I had no idea. That's awesome. So where was this place gonna be? Portland, maybe. Nothing fancy, just something small and intimate where I can serve the kind of food I grew up on. Then why are you still here? Well, I was first hired as their vacation house chef. Vacation house chef? Oh, god. I wanna be them so bad. Right? You'll love this place. It is deep in palm desert 20 minutes away from any civilization. Oh, sounds perfect. So then what happened? Let's just say they are really good at getting people to do what they want. They have connections. They told me that if I came to work for them full-time for a year, they would help me open my own place. And when was that? A while ago. Hmm. S'mores. How delightful. Hey. Come with me. - What? - Come. What? Is everything okay? Uh-hmm. Okay. It's time. - Pee. - What? - Here. - Yeah. But aren't we supposed to wait to take the test at the doctor? I don't care what the doctor said. It's just a bunch of crap. Now pee. - Are you peeing? - I'm trying. I'm not used to peeing in front of anyone. You done? Yeah. Okay. Come on. This is what I wanted to show you. Do you think she's pretty? I don't. I don't know why everyone is fawning all over her. I mean, I keep looking at her face trying to figure out why everyone is so obsessed with her. Does she look like she has star quality? Um, she's cute, I guess. You guess? What kind of answer is that? I mean, she's not you. She's okay if you like that, but, I mean, she's nothing special. Right? She's like nothing special. I mean, I can't think of anyone with more star quality than you. Oh, thank you, olivia. Thank you for being so sweet and honest and you're a breath of fresh air. Oh, the pregnancy test. Oh, okay. Just, ava, remember what the doctor said. It's not gonna be accurate this early so don't-- can I do anything right? Oh. Hey, I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Don't touch me 'cause you do not deserve to be here. Morning, olivia. Oh. Um, good morning. Just gonna... Eat one of these. That's cool. You sleep okay? Um, yeah, slept okay. How about you? Hmm. By a rock. Morning sweets. Morning, babe. Hmm. - Hmm. - Well, good morning. Did you--how'd you sleep? - Like a dream. - Hayden: Uh-hmm. I bet you did. I gotta go. You -. Hilarious. I gotta go fire my agents in 30. They're useless. Anyways, I thought afterwards we could do a little pre-baby shopping, some lunch. That is if you're free. I'm just craving one of those grilled veggie salads. Uh, yeah. I'm free. Oh. Goodness, olivia. I'm not asking you to join me in a prison riot. I just thought it'd be fun, you know, a fun girl day. You, me, midday champagne. Yeah. No. It's--it sounds like fun, I'm in. Great. I'll scoop you up at noon. And get your shopping shoes on 'cause momma's gonna buy you a new pair of shoes. Bye, baby. - Uh-hmm. - Ava: Uh-hmm. Do you know if peter's there? I'm gonna be right back. So I told him I did not have the stamina to do that again unless we brought patty in. And we did, twice. Wow. It's girl fun day. We can't stop now. And it's your turn. And you better make it good. My turn for what? I just told you three of my best sex stories and none of them involved hayden. Now it is your turn and make it good. Oh, god. I don't know. - Um, well, um, my ex-- - uh-hmm. --He used to like to do it on the subway platforms. Oh, my god. You little minks. You used to bang on the a-train? Oh. I knew something freaky was going on in there. Okay. Give me the details. Well, no, I-I-I tried, but I couldn't get into it. It was just too... Hot? Sexy? - Full of vandals? - Dirty. Like, it's really unsanitary if you think about it. Yeah! Exactly. I don't know. Is that why he's your ex? Uh, no. He just--he had other interests. Being with other girls was of them, so... That bastard. What is his name? I'm gonna look him up. Maybe I will-- - oh. - --Do a post about him. Uh, you--uh, you know what? I don't even think he's on here anymore. Everyone is on social media. It's un-american if you're not. - Thank you. - Uh-hmm. Oh. Are you sure you're upset he cheated on you? I mean, are those abs for real? Okay. Are you ready to go? Let's get out of here. Where is that ticket thingy? Um, can you tell the valet to bring my car around? It's, uh, what did I drive today? It's a black range rover. Thank you. Uh-hmm. Thank you. Hmm. Okay. You know what? Can you sign this for me? The numbers are moving around. Yes. Sure. Woo. Oh. Ava, are you sure you're okay to drive? Oh. I'm perfectly fine. It's just my stupid ankle. Okay. Oh, paparazzi. Scheduling egg retrieval for next Tuesday? Are you coming? Well, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, okay. Outside. Yes. There you go. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm so busy, I have to go. One, one. What's her birthday? 28. Oh. We will need her consent. This is very dangerous. Knock, knock. Can I come in? - Hey. - What's that? Oh, um, I think this may have fallen on one of the shopping bags. - Is that ava's phone? - Yeah. Oh, thank god. She has been looking everywhere for this. That could've been so bad. Your itinerary for the upcoming week. Your doctor's appointment on Wednesday has been moved to 3:30. Other than that, basically the same. Thanks. You okay? You look a little sweaty. Oh, yeah. I'm good. Just day drinking, yeah. Ah, yes. Ava has a similar look about her this evening. Is everything okay with her? What do you mean? Nothing. Nothing. You cool? Yeah, she just--she seemed like she really wanted to let loose today. Yeah. Ava has been under a lot of stress lately that her last three films had been total flops. I know you don't know anything about this industry, but it's basically like actor cancer. No, I totally get that and I'm sure she knows what she's doing. It's just all the drinking and the cocaine, I just feel like that can't be good for her eggs. Well, we've already retrieved them so it's okay. Yeah, okay. I'm sure you're right. Did you pick up your prescription? Yes, we did. Oh, actually, I think this one's... Oh, that one is not for you. Thank you. - Good night, livs. - Bye, cass. Hey. Hey. It's, uh, it's for my diabetes. Will you let me know when you're ready to roll? Oh, um, I thought ava was taking me to my appointment today. Nope. You're stuck with me today. Right. Um, you know, if you're not feeling up to it, you totally don't have to take me. - I can just uber. - What? I feel amazing. I've been looking forward to this appointment all day. Right. You'll see your friend. Don't--don't you and dr. Gregory go way back? Yeah, we did. Good ol' dr. Gregory. It must be nice that he gets to, um, you know, be a part of this journey with you guys. Yeah. Yeah. He's the--he's the best, you know, he always has been. Made a name for himself. Helping women achieve their dreams. Kind of like me. Made a name for myself, helping only one woman achieve her dreams by getting everything she wants. Well, I mean, getting to become a father, that's huge. It doesn't get any more meaningful than that, right? Oh, absolutely, fatherhood. Come on in. Oh, um, I'm gonna be dropping you off, but cassidy's gonna be picking you up. I got a thing I'm gonna get to downtown today. Cool? Oh, yeah. That's cool. All right then. Shall we? Uh-hmm. - Hi. - Hi. Picking up for olivia bolton? Okay. You know, cass, I could totally pick up my own prescriptions like a big girl. - You know the drill, livs. - Yeah, I know. It's just kind of weird that I'm putting all this stuff to my body and I don't even know what I'm taking. Oh, you know, sorry. I gotta take this. This is cassidy. No, that's not right. No. So I can only give you the lupron for today. The ovidrel, it's gonna have to be called in. Okay. Do you mind telling me what these prescriptions actually do? Oh, sure. So the first one, it's the... You know, I-- I need to call you back. And it's a hormone that supports the... - Oh. - ...Normal development Of an egg in a woman's ovary. There should be two prescriptions here. Unfortunately, we cannot provide you with the ovidrel without talking to dr. Gregory first. Oh, that's fine. I'll give him a call now. I'm just gonna need ms. Bolton's signature. Oh, I'm authorized to sign that. Thank you. Go ahead. I have a couple questions for the pharmacist. Okay. Um, okay. So for ava's, do I need to have that called in as well or it's in the system? - No, it's in the system. - Great. - That's fine. - Good. - Thank you. - Let me just take a look. It's oh, my god. You look ridiculous, ava. You're so miserable. It's pathetic. - Ever. - God. I can't do this anymore. You can't do this? Olivia? Hey. Ava, um, is everything okay? Is everything okay with you? Yeah. Yeah, everything's great. Are you-- are you sure you're okay? Like, can I help you? Oh, sure thing, sweets. Sure, you can help fix ol' broken ava. Got an ovary I can borrow? Oh, what do you have there? Oh, um... I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? Yeah. Yeah. I am. You're pregnant? Yeah. I know I wasn't supposed to take the test yet, but, um... - You're pregnant? - Yeah, I'm pregnant. We're having a baby. Oh. Don't let me interrupt you, ladies. We're having a baby, baby. What? Oh, hell, yes, we are. What... we're having a baby. - Oh, thank you, thank you. - Hmm. Just know this hasn't been easy. - Thank you. - Of course. Thank you. Isn't she adorable? - Uh-huh. - Uh-hmm. Um, well, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go to bed but you guys celebrate. No. No, no, no, no. Don't go. We wanna celebrate, right? Yes, we do. Um, no, it's okay. Um, honestly, it's past my bed time. Oh, boo. Don't be a party pooper, olivia. Tell her not to be a party poop. Don't be a party pooper, olivia. We wanna celebrate with you. Oh, um... - Whoa. - Oh. She's a bit of a loud one, eh? Come here. Come here. - Shh. - No. - Shh. - Wait. Please stop. Please get off. Stop it. Just please, please, please stop. Stop, the baby. I don't wanna hurt the baby. What? What, is that a thing? Is that a thing? Yeah. The--the doctor said that I have to be careful this early 'cause it could--it could hurt the baby so I can't. Let her go. Party pooper. Uh, uh, uh. No more junk food, olivia. Peter, I give you strict orders. You are carrying our baby. Only pregnancy approved foods. - You have the list. - Yes, ma'am. Now, I want olivia to eat everything on it starting with the eggs. Also, you'll take 30-minute daily walks from here on out. It's what's best for the baby. Peter. Hey, I can't eat eggs. Seriously, they gross me out. I promise. I'll try to make them as least gross as possible. But ava refuses to do a reality show even though it could probably bring life back into her career. I mean they would kill it more, you know. Liv? - Olivia? - Yeah, sorry. Um, yeah, you're right. Yeah. Sure, I am. Are you okay? Do you need to sit down? - No. I'm--I'm fine. - Okay. Are you sure? You haven't said anything since we left the house. You know, you can talk to me. Thanks cass, but, um, no, I'm fine. Let's just keep walking. Sure. Have you ever worried that you've gotten yourself into a situation that you thought was one thing but then you realized it's not at all what you thought? What do you mean? Nothing. Just--I don't know. I have a history of poor judgment. - Okay. - That came out wrong. Look, hayden and ava have been so generous with me. And I'm beyond grateful for this opportunity to help them, it's just-- I don't know, sometimes I get this feeling, not all the time but sometimes, that they're a little wild, like, are they really ready to have a baby in the house? Yeah. What do you mean? Of course. - They wanted this for years. - Well, that's the other thing. Sometimes it feels, like, hayden doesn't want this. I mean, no, of course he does, it's just-- I don't know, he said some things. It feels like he'd be okay without a baby too. And there's just been some weird stuff, like ava, she has these bruises on her wrists. That's not normal, right? And these walks, I mean, no offense because I love having someone to walk with but it's like I'm never allowed to be alone, like, ever. Olivia, that's for your safety. We've been through this. You know that ava and hayden have explicitly asked for discretion. I understand that. I, I do, but I just--I feel, like, I'm a prisoner sometimes. A prisoner? Wow. Okay. Prisoner was the wrong word. I just--I don't know. I guess I'm just not used to all the security cameras, the chaperons. Now that I'm saying it out loud maybe it, it doesn't sound like such a big deal. It's just-- they're always on something. I just don't feel like a baby would be safe there. It's not really up to you to decide whether or not you think they're ready to be parents. Well, I'm not saying I have the right. - I just, I'm-- - you know what I think? I think you need to be grateful that you get to be any part of this. And that you need to keep your mouth shut. I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't-- no, you signed an nda. There are rules. You need to follow them. Got it? Yeah. I got it. It won't be a problem. Good. I think it's time to go home now. Writing your memoirs on those toasty tarts? What? Oh. Yeah, that's funny. No, no, no. Please. I got it. Don't you think you're carrying enough around? I know, right? Look at this thing. Yeah, it's a-- it's hard not to. It's huge. Ssh, don't let ava hear you say that. She's still following you around with that tape measure? Oh, yeah. I always thought that pregnancy would be nine months of brownies, instead it's sardines, fish liver oil, and eggs. I really think I'm gonna need a new chef. Thank you for reminding me of your daily dose... Ugh. ...Of macaque placenta. You're the worst. I know. There you are. Did you have your eggs this morning? Yes. They were delicious. Great. - No butter, right? - No butter ma'am. Okay. I am off. Big meeting today. Oh, that salmon piece can you make that for olivia's lunch? Oh. And take extra good care of my munchkin. That doesn't seem right. Stand up. Peter, scale. Okay. Hmm. Step up. Let's make your walk an hour today, okay? Uh-hmm. All right. Everybody, have a great day. It's like she knows what I'm even thinking about junk food. So I'm supposed to look pregnant but not too pregnant, how do women do this? Well, for what it's worth, I think you look incredible for someone so huge. You're the worst. Oh, my god. Is that you? Hello. Hello in there. I'm gonna take such good care of you. I love you so much. You may not, um, get to see me as much as you'd like. You may not get to know me very well but I will always, always love you. Okay? To the moon and back. No matter what. Good morning, jarred. It must be 6:15. Eggs it is. There you go. That smells downright delicious. Sorry, I can't figure how to-- it was on too high. You don't say. Thank you. I really thought I could handle making some lousy eggs. - But you hate eggs. - I know. Hey, can I tell you something? That this is how you punish them while I'm gone? Ha-ha. Funny. No. Last night, I felt the baby move. She kicked. It was incredible, also a little weird, very sci-fi but incredible. And I guess, I don't know, I just--I wanna make sure she gets a proper diet. What? - Is that really weird? - No. It's actually pretty sweet. Is she moving now? No, not right now. But, you know, I read that if you eat something sweet can help make the baby move. - Oh, did you now? - Uh-hmm. Yeah. I mean, I guess we'll never know. No, I guess not. Except that, - I did just make these. - Oh. But, you know, who needs to feel the baby move anyway. Oh, not me. I already felt her so I'm good. No. Not a big deal. Uh-hmm. It's fine. - Yeah. It's cool. - Awesome. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. - Okay, fine, have one. - Ah! Thank you. Oh, my god. So good. Thank you. - Uh, is she moving yet? - I haven't even swallowed. What about now? Not yet. Here. See. Did you feel that? - No. - Oh. It's crazy. - Whoa. - You feel that? Okay, yeah, I felt that. Wow. Wow. See you tomorrow then, huh? Hmm? Who's that? That is nobody. No, just take it, get out of here, get out of here. - Okay. Let's see here. - Cheese please. Cheese, all right. No! What do you want from me? - Stop! - Hayden: I can't! I can't! - Please! Look! - Hayden: no! You're ridiculous. Whatever! Get out! I don't like this ava. And you're gonna have your child. Screw you! It's got to end. Jarred. Miss, let me up. 2045 - - here you go. - Oh, thank you. The vujajic's fell victim to a set-off after a peace session rally that heralded down industrials through the 10,000... Ava von richter, one of hollywood's biggest stars and her husband, hayden von richter, - held an impromptu... - What? ...Press conference today. Now, it appears the von richters are having issues getting pregnant. - They hired a surrogate... - Does anybody have the remote for this? Can we turn the volume up? Please we just want our baby back. We have a mountain of evidence that she's not to be trusted and can harm herself and our baby. And we return with a breaking news headline about ava von richter in search of her own baby. Oh, you shouldn't be doing that, miss. Here, let me help you. ...Being held at the von richter's home. And, uh, we found these in her room. I mean, it's very likely that our baby's health is being threatened at this very moment by her blatant and her reckless drug use. She also stole a very valuable family heirloom and might be wearing it and it's a gold necklace. It belonged to my great grandmother. And as you can see from the video footage, she is unstable and should be considered dangerous. I am gonna murder you. - Whoa, relax, relax. - Olivia: we just want our baby with us where she belongs. Ava, spell the last name for us, one more time. Bolton, b-o-l-t-o-n, olivia. Bolton? Excuse me. Excuse me. - This is gonna... - Deidre: I'm not interested. No, I actually, - I really need you... - I said I'm not interested. Please, I just need to make a quick call. - I really... - Get off of me. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. - Oh, olivia bolton? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'mma need you to walk with me. Come on. Mrs. Von richter. Please call me ava. Ava. Are you sure you don't wanna press charges? The stolen vehicle is still at the precinct. That won't be necessary officer... - Officer woll. - Ava: Officer woll, that is a very strong name. We already informed freshies of the misunderstanding. Okay. Okay. And your bravery and discretion is much appreciated. Oh, no. I can't accept that, ma'am. You absolutely can. You saved our child's life. Thank you, officer woll. Have a lovely day. Have a great day, ava. Thank you. Sit. - Welcome back. - Ava, listen. - I'm really, really sorry... - I'm doing the talking now. Understood? Perfect. I think we can all agree things - got a little out of hand, yes? - Yes. So a little birdy told me that you believe hayden and I are not suited to become parents. No, ava, that's not what I said. I... What would possess someone to make such a statement after all we've been nothing but kind and generous to you? Am I wrong, cassidy? Haven't I done everything in my power to assure that olivia is comfortable - and welcome in our home? - Absolutely. So what would possess someone to be so ungrateful, so completely disrespectful? I don't know, ava. I told olivia she should be grateful and she should mind her own business. - Hmm. - Ava, look. I'm-- I think this is all just a misunderstanding, okay? I saw hayden hurting you and I didn't... Hayden has never hurt me a day in my life. But I saw him. He had you pinned against the wall. I do not know what you think you saw, olivia, but I can assure you the lies you are spreading will end here. I'm not trying to spread any lies. You obviously can't be trusted. Do you think she can be trusted? No, I don't. That's what I thought. I think we let you in a little too close. Maybe it was my fault. - No. - Ava: I don't know. Ava, no. Look, this baby, she-she means the world to me. I just--I-I was confused and I was scared and I-I didn't know what to do. - This is all just a misunder... - Misunderstanding. Yes, you said that. Can you stand up? - Ava, please. - Ava: I said stand up. We have new accommodations for you. Sit. This will be your new home for the rest of your pregnancy. You will not leave this room and if for some reason, you do not follow these rules, you will be punished. Have a good night. No. Wait. Ava, please. Ava! Ava, please, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay? You don't have to do this. Please. I'm sorry. You guys? Peter? Hello? Cass? Ava, come on! Time to get dressed. We're going for a walk. What? Come on. Don't take all day. Cassidy, please tell me what's going on. - Cass? - Can we just walk? Please. No. Would you look at me for god sakes? Why are you letting her do this? Why are you letting this happen to me? Just stop, okay? Please, just--please behave and just stop. Just stop? I have been on captive by a psychopath and you want me to just stop? Don't raise your voice because she might hear you. Ava is not a psychopath, okay? She's just--she's under a lot of stress right now. I don't give a crap how much stress that crazy washed-up so-called actress is under. This is her baby and she's torturing us. I can't have this conversation with you, okay? I am here to make sure that you get exercise and that's what we're gonna do. Got it? Are you joking right now? Let's go. No. I'm not going anywhere with you. Olivia, yes, you are because if you don't, I can assure you there will be consequences. Do you think your new living accommodations are bad now? You haven't seen anything yet. Do you like me to go back inside and have a conversation with ava? I said let's go. Oh, crap. Cass. What? I have to pee. It's a pregnancy thing. Fine. Do your thing. Really? Can I have a little privacy, please? You know, the fish oil goes right through me. You really don't wanna see that. Do your thing. I'll be right outside. Olivia? - Olivia, what are you doing? - Shh. I'm caught. I need help. - Ah! - Are you okay? - No. I... - peter: Well, this is locked, - so I'm gonna go around, okay? - No, wait. No, no, no, no, no.

The family I never had. I knew we were out of control. I did. The relationship and me, it was just-- it was all out of control. I just couldn't stop it. I just have to stop it. This thing I do I just--I'm so scared of losing everything but I just crushed the thing I love. I'm so sorry, olivia. I'm so sorry. This is gonna be so hard. It may be hard but they say, the mother, it's worth it. I guess I'll never know. What do you mean? Of course you will. No, I won't. If hayden and I are separated, the pregnancy will be terminated. What? No. Ava, what? You can't--you can't do that. It's not me, it's on the contract. So go to the doctor in the morning. No. Ava, ava. It's just-- it's almost full term. It's not right. It's not even legal. I can assure you it's perfectly legal. Check the nda. No, ava. She's a living person. You can't do this, please. Ava! Ava! She can't do this. Cass! Cass! Cass! Cass, please just take me to the hospital. - I... - Cass, I'm bleeding. I have to get ava. - No. - I have to get ava. - I'm sorry. - No, no, she's gonna kill her. She's gonna kill the baby, please.

I can do it. - Okay. - Okay. It's okay. Hurry. Okay. Come on, cass. Hurry, cass. We got to go. It's okay. You ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. No! Something's not right. There's a lot of blood. I'm bleeding. - Keep the sweater. - Oh, thank you. It's okay. Stay with me, okay? Huh? Oh, god. Where are we? Up on richter's vacation home, it's palm desert. It's 20 minutes from civilization. Just stay with me, olivia. It's gonna be okay. I-I don't have any service. I don't know where we're going. Olivia. Olivia, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for all of these. I--you have to believe me I wanted to help you. I--I saw what they were doing to you. I just--my mom, my mom was so sick and ava-- ava, she was the one who saved her. She--she got her the best doctors. She paid for everything. She had my mom right in her hands, and I thought-- I thought if I lost you and the baby that I was gonna lose my mom, too. I didn't think that I had the choice. I don't expect you to forgive me. Hey. - Help me. - Cassidy: Come on. - It's okay. - Olivia: ava, please. Please, we need help. Where do you think you're going? Huh? There's nothing for miles, cassidy. You're a lot stupider than I thought. Ava, this is serious, please. Stop. I am so sick of everyone doing whatever the f they want. Ava, please there's something wrong with the baby. Do you think I give a rat's ass about that baby? I'm the one in control. I'm the one with the gun. I'm the one with the power. You don't get to have it all anymore, olivia. You know, you're young and you're hot. We could-- we could use some of these farm fresh eggs. Scheduling egg retrieval for next Tuesday. Got an ovary I can borrow? She's not your baby. You can't have kids. This whole time you never could. Oh, look who's the damn genius now? Ava von richter can't even have her own babies. Her eggs are useless. Isn't that hilarious? Oh, actually I think this one's... That is not for you. Thank you. I'm gonna say this for you, cassidy. You sure know how to pick 'em. Ava, please stop it. No. Let's give credit where credit is due. I told you I needed someone to give me a baby and poof there she is. Ta-da! And you knew? Cass, you knew this whole time? I did. Don't be so shy, cassidy. She handpicked you. She found me someone who's so lost in life, so easily manipulated that they would never know. They were being used for their own eggs. No job, no family, or relationship, broke, and desperate to please. Perfect. Dear god, you're so lovesick over peter. You didn't even realize all those treatments you were undergoing were to get you knocked up with your own baby. Ava, please stop. You are an ungrateful bitch. See this mess? You did this. After everything I've done for you and your mom this is how you treat me? Please don't, ava. I hope I was worth it. Do you think I'm scared of you? You're nothing. You're nobody. At least I'm a no one who will have her own baby. Hey, it's gonna be okay. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. It was too much. She lost too much. She'll be able to recover, right? Hard to say. There was a lot of trauma, best to try and let her heal as best as she can. You're up. That's good. How are you feeling? Try and take slow breathes. You had a scare there, little dear. You're going to be okay. I promise. I promise. Looks like someone wants to meet you. Oh. Look at you. Look at that. You're a natural. Look at you. You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. My beautiful, beautiful baby. Shh. Wow, she is perfect. I hope it's okay that I'm here. I got a message from cassidy. How you feeling? Um, I'm confused. Oh. No. These are just processed breakfast sugars, your favorite. Ah. Too soon. Okay. Um, look, olivia, I-- I'm sorry. I really don't know what else to say. I--I feel like a complete idiot. You knew. What? This whole time, you knew that-- that it wasn't ava's baby. You knew she was mine. Oh, no. God, no, olivia I'm-- I can't believe that I'd-- I can't believe I thought you were a good guy. I was so stupid. Olivia, please listen to me. I had no idea. Just no more lying, peter. Come on, I deserve better than that. You're right. You do. And yeah, I've worked for hayden and ava long enough to know they were into some pretty dark stuff, but it wasn't my business. And, yeah, I could've said some things to stop some of it. But--but with you and with this, I really had no idea. Right. Yeah. I didn't wanna like you. And god, I'd-- I did not wanna care about you. But somehow you-you managed to make me care... About you, about her. Hey, I just don't know what to believe. Yeah. I, I get that. Cassidy and I are gonna give our statements to the police this afternoon, probably long overdue, I just-- I just wanted you to know that we're gonna make things right, okay? Peter... I don't know how I'm gonna do this. I don't even have a job. That makes two of us. I don't even have a place to live. Same. I'm serious. How am I supposed to raise a baby? I don't have anything. You and me. Both of you. Not to mention, a one hell of a story to write. And I hear portland's lovely this time of year. ♪ Oh ♪
