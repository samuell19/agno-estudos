What Remains of the ancient world Has been ravaged by the Beat-Wars. The blood sport "Beat-Beat Revelation" has been forbidden in all civilized corners of the land. But beyond civilization, in the ruins of the old world, lies The Wastes. Where Beat-Beat Revelation is still the only way of life. Where the ultimate prize is "The Quatro" or booze as it was once known. Whoever controls the Quatro, controls the Wastes. And only one Quatro Oasis Remains... But high up atop Frazier Mountain The FP. One of the last remaining safe havens in the civilized world. Where booze still flows like rivers. This is your new home JTRO. Rage and RE-NINJ come from the sky, JTRO. From the Gods of the sky 'n shit. But RE-NINJ is our god, ya heard? But you must respect The path to the true Beat-Beat Master comes with its ass a riddle.
