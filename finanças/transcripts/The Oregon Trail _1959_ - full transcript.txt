He was inspired to try his fortunes in the New World by the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. Well. Well, you're, uh, new here, aren't you, Miss Shoemaker? Well, I'm not. You see, I, too, work for Mr. Bennett. As a matter of fact, I wrote that speech, so spare me, please. But Mr. Bennett said that he's never to be disturbed while he's composing a piece. Miss Shoemaker, I arrived back in New York this afternoon after spending three weeks in Washington where I did nothing but wait in outer offices. Now this evening, I was having dinner at Delmonico's with a lovely lady when I received a message from Mr. Bennett commanding me to come here immediately, that it was most urgent. Now, uh, he evidently didn't inform you that he was expecting me. Would you be a good girl and tell Mr. Bennett I'm here? Well, uh... Excuse me, Mr. Harris. Yes? There's a Mr. Harris here. He says he has an appointment with you. Yes. Come in, Harris. Thank you, Miss Shoemaker. I wish you would write as well as you dress. Oh. Well, it all depends on the incentive, sir. Tonight the incentive was much prettier than the people I interview. Well, did you have enough incentive to see Polk? No, I didn't, sir. Why not? Because he refused to see me. Hmm. Ah. Uh-huh. He did. Hmm. So that little man in the White House is afraid to discuss the Oregon question with the New York Herald. It seems so, sir. Hmm. Huh. Here. The Oregon Trail by Francis Parkman. Well? Read it. Right now? This confounded book has caused thousands of feeble-minded failures to pull up stakes and set out to be burned and murdered, robbed and ruined, crossin' in wagons over this so-called "Oregon Trail." Hmph. Do you know what the Oregon question is, Mr. Harris? No, I don't, sir. I didn't get a chance to ask Mr. Polk. It's a question of war, Mr. Harris. War? I have information that Polk has sent, or is sending army men disguised as settlers into Oregon. I want this information verified. In short, Mr. Harris, I want you to go to Oregon. Me? Now, Mr. Bennett, I'm hardly what you'd call the pioneer type. I, uh... If we cannot get the news about Oregon in Washington, we'll get it on the trail itself. Start packin' your bags at once. Mr. Bennett, I'm having dinner at Delmonico's. The young lady is waiting for... Cancel it! Yes, sir. And on your way out, tell Miss Shoemaker to get me a pickled herring. A pickled herring. And some milk. And some milk. Mr. Bennett, I'd say your reputation for being a courageous man is well founded. ...where you will rendezvous with the men of your command. Arrangements have been made for you to travel with a civilian wagon train being led by army scout George Seton. S-E-T-O-N, leaving from Westport. Now, your group will be one of several carefully chosen units moving into the Oregon Territory. You will travel as civilians, as this mission must be kept secret. Repeat that: "Secret." Three. Upon arrival at Fort Laramie, you will report your group to Major... Major... Dexter. D-E-X-T-E-R, for further orders. Four. The overall purpose of this mission is to prepare for the eventuality of war. God forbid. I, uh, I-I beg your pardon, Mr. President? The eventuality of war. Yes, sir. And to defend the rights of 6,000 good Americans already settled in Oregon, and... Yes? The British ambassador, Mr. President. Oh, good. Show him in. Add whatever is necessary to that to clarify it, and take it yourself to Captain Wayne in person. At West Point, sir? No, at the, uh, army hospital here in Washington. He's recovering from a wound. Yes, sir. Sir Richard Wallingham, ambassador for Her Majesty, Queen Victoria. Welcome back, Mr. Ambassador. I'm glad to see you, Sir Richard. Sit. I trust you had a quiet crossing from England? The Atlantic Ocean knows who rules the waves, Mr. Polk. Yes, with certain minor interruptions, uh, 1812, for example. I trust Her Majesty is in good health. At 27, is anyone ever in bad health? At 27, all problems have solutions. In that case, Mr. President, perhaps a young queen and a young nation can come to terms. That is my earnest desire, Sir Richard. This is the territory where we mean to add new stars to our flag. I can foresee a time when we shall have as many as 30 sovereign states, yes, perhaps even 32! Nothing can keep us from expanding as far as to the Pacific Ocean. Now please don't wince, Sir Richard. A 20-year postponement, agreed upon by our two nations for the eventual settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute has expired. It seems a tragedy, all this furor over a wilderness mainly populated by redskin barbarians. Well, if the situation is as simple as that, sir, there'll be no opposition from Her Majesty's government. Nothing is ever quite that simple with Her Majesty's government. Well, at any rate, I can't see your government risking a war over a territory populated mostly by redskin barbarians. But we will. Very well, sir. I shall so report your ultimatum to Her Majesty's ministers. Good day, Mr. President. Steady as she goes. Hard to "starport." Break out the landing lead, Mr. Scott. Young man, you come down from there. Yes, ma'am. Richard! Yes, ma'am! Whose train are you goin' on, Mr. Harris? Uh, man named Seton's. You know where I can find him? Uh, try there. Bowers might know where he's at. Thank you. May I be of assistance, ma'am? Take your hands off me. I don't know you, young man. Let me go! Hey. Hey, Dad, they hit our wagon. What's the idea of takin' up the whole road? What happened? This drunken sot deliberately ran into us. You have a point there, ma'am. Is this your wagon, tenderfoot? It's my wagon, and I expect you to pay for the damage! All right. Here's your pay. No, Papa, don't! You heard the gentleman. He expects you to pay for the damage. Brizzard! All right. Fight's over. What makes you think so? Brizzard! Back to the wagon. Yes, sir. Just a minute. You seem to be responsible for this man's behavior. I presume you'll also be responsible for the damage he caused that wagon. You heard me. Move! May I, uh, apologize for my friend's behavior, ma'am? George Wayne at your service. Who's gonna fix my wagon wheel? I'll have it taken care of. Ellis? Yes, sir. I sincerely hope nobody was hurt, ma'am. No, Mr. Wayne, and thank you very much. Goodbye. Is there anything I can do but say thank you? Well, you could tell me your name. Mine's Neal Harris. It's Prudence. Prudence Cooper. Prudence. That's a very pretty name. Uh, these are yours, I believe, sir.Yes. Uh, thank you very much. It was a pleasure, sir. Uh, well, I... I guess I'd better go see to Grandma. Goodbye, and thanks again.Goodbye. Oh, Mr. Bowers? Yes? Could you tell me where I could find a man named... Garrison! I'll be with you in just a moment, sir. I caught you. Take care, Brother Bowers. No slanders, if you please. What have you got in your hand? Destiny, 'tis written on my empty palm. Uh, the other one. The lines of fate, the moons of Saturn. I ask you, sir, do I look like a common thief? I wouldn't say there was anything common about you, sir. Spoken like the gentleman you obviously are. From London or the, uh, boulevards of Paris? New York. I represent a newspaper, Mr. Bennett's Herald.Aha. A man of letters. No, just a reporter. Harris is the name. Oh, it's an honor, Mr. Bennett... Uh, I mean, uh, Mr. Harris. We'll outfit you from head to heel. If you're not going to buy anything, would you please get out? And now, sir, where shall we begin? Mr. Bowers, I came in here to ask you if you could help me locate a man named Seton. Of course. But if you're going on the trail, first things first. I, uh, bumped into something, it seems. Explain this. Caught red-handed. Now you see, sir, why our prices seem high. Isn't it possible those things might have fallen into the handkerchief by accident? That's exactly how it happened, sir, in a trice. The town marshal will have you in a trice, in a trice, you, you thieving scoundrel! Thou shalt not bear false witness, Brother Bowers. Mr. Bowers, if you will tell me the value of the contents of the handkerchief, I would be glad to pay for them. Then I hope you'll be kind enough to tell me where I can find Mr. Seton. Now how much? Half price to you, sir. Fifteen dollars even. That's half price, hmm? Shun him, Brother Harris, as you would the foul plague. Why, these paltry trifles, accidentally acquired, aren't worth three bits. You keep out of this, Brother Garrison. Mr. Bennett's money. There you are, $15. And, uh, don't forget to give some to your church. Oh, I will. I will. Thank you. And now for your purchases for the Oregon Trail. This fine gentleman doesn't want any of your moth-eaten merchandise. You get out. Now. I'll be most happy to drive you to Mr. Seton's headquarters, Brother Harris. Well, that's very kind of you, Mr. Garrison. But I suppose I will need some clothes and things for the trail. Ah, caveat emptor. That means "Let the buyer beware." Well, now, first thing you'll need is a money belt. Money belt? Oh, you mean, uh, in case someone wants to steal my money. Yes.Ah. And you'll need shirts, and some... A few pair of pants. My wagon. Allow me a comment, sir. Though clad in the garb of a rustic, you have the aura of a prince. You have the aura of a man with trees.Ha-ha. You have a most discerning eye, sir. Apple trees. Saplings to populate the distant slopes of Oregon. Get aboard. Well, they... build these things kinda high off the ground, don't they? The view's all the better. Stir your shanks. Strike sparks with your fleet hooves. Away, my noble steeds! Brother Seton, Neal Harris, the noted author, wants to join up with the wagon train. Got a wagon? He'd like to find a place in one. I can pay my way. Eh? You may have to work your way, young fella. Put yourself aboard my wagon over there. I'll, uh, see if I can fix you up with a horse tomorrow.Fine. And, uh, where will I sleep? Same place you're gonna sleep for the next five months, providin' you last that long, under the wagon. Under the wagon, hmm? Yeah. Mr. Harris? Well, good evening, Miss Prudence. Now that you've joined the wagon train, I-I thought I'd come and ask you to have supper with us. Well, how did you know I'd... How did you know I'd joined? Brother Garrison has been preaching the, uh, "gossip." Oh. Well, I'd, uh, be very happy to dine with you.Good. Uh, come on. Jeremiah, you've been a failure all your life. Don't know why you had to come more than 3,000 miles just to keep on bein' it. Brought another guest for dinner. Oh, glad you could come, Mr. Harris. So am I. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. I see you got rid of your fightin' clothes. Yes. I don't wear them when I go out socially. Uh, would one of you bring the stew pot to the table? Oh, yes. It's hot. Oh, I see you know your way around a campfire. Who doesn't? I don't. Mr. Harris, are you a failure? A failure, ma'am? Yes, I guess you might say I am. I work for a newspaper. My son's a failure. Well, not from my point of view. Do you have to say things like that, Mama, especially to perfect strangers? You mustn't mind Grandma. She really loves everyone. Choose your places, gentlemen. We're just family. Thank you. Would you join me for supper, Grandma Cooper? Oh, la-Di-da. Why don't you stop actin' a lie? It's just as bad as tellin' one. Like, why don't you go and sit where you're meant to in the first place? Thank you. Oh, no, Jeremiah, no! Oh, do I have your place, Mr. Harris? Oh, no. No, Mr. Cooper, I'll sit right over here, thank you. Aw. Would you like to change places with me? Yes, I would. Uh, Papa, you belong at the head of the table. Oh, of course, Prudence. Thank you. O Lord, as we start on our long journey into an unknown land, we give thanks for all Thy wondrous blessings. We thank Thee this night for the bread we break together in Thy name. We know not, O Lord, the many hardships which await us on the trail, but we ask Thee to stand and watch over us and protect us in a new land. Thy will be done, amen. Your cinch goes around like that, and she comes back here and tightens, and that's all there is to it. Well, thanks very much, Mr. Seton. Ain't you, uh, ain't you never rid a horse before? Oh, yes. Quite a while ago though. I remember the horse had rockers under it. Yeah.Thanks. Seton, what in heaven's name is holding us up? Well, I guess I am. I'm sorry. I'm wagon master here, Mr. Decker. This train moves when I say so. Well, don't be so uppity. I'm not a lackey, you know. Yeah, I know. I know somethin' else, too. Your wagon's overloaded. I don't think so. You don't, eh? Well, just remember, I warned ya. Mount to the left side, son. Yeah, thanks.Giddy-up. Come on, boy. Squaw man. Is that bad? Would you marry an Indian, my friend? Well, I don't know. That all depends. I... Wh-whoop. Hah. I wouldn't wanna make any snap judgments about a thing like that until the problem arose, you know. Yep, here we go. Whoop. Come on! Here we go. Whoa-hoa. Well, Jesse, old friend, we're startin' on another trip to Oregon. Ah, we've kept ahead of 'em so far. Ain't no time to start worryin' now. We're movin' out!

Well, how's the traveling orchard, Mr. Garrison? Oh, flourishing like the green bay tree. How is my literary friend? Ah, still just a reporter. Oh, now don't belittle your talents, sir. Oregon can use those gifts of yours. Oregon awaits men of all sorts: The sowers and the reapers, the hewers of wood and the drawers of water, the workers... and the dreamers. Which are you, worker or a dreamer? I, sir, am the bringer of trees, apple trees, to Oregon. The poet laureates of the orchards to come will sing of my trees, how they're trees of health and beauty. Yes, sir, I shall plant them, and you shall write of them, and one day, your children shall eat of them. You sound as though you were in love with them. Ah, a man of rare discernment. Have you noticed my apparel? Well, I could hardly help but notice it, Mr. Garrison. This, Mr. Harris, is a wedding coat. Yeah. Well, allow me to congratulate you.Yes. Congratulate me on escaping the snares of a she-devil. I was deserted at the altar, sir, left standing like a stunned whip-poor-will, betrayed by a trusted friend. I wear this coat on the trail, sir, partly not to waste it, a fine tailor made it for me, and partly to remind myself never again to speak in way of love to a woman. Trees are my women. Well, I'd say trees are a lot safer, Mr. Garrison. Wagons, forward! Abby! Look what I found. If you say so, Mama, we'll go back home. No. No, this old tree wouldn't take roots there, either. You've got a dream, Jerry, something you never had before. I know, Mama, but... Keep still. I... I wanna listen to the singin'. May I be excused? Yes. May I be excused please, Uncle Tom? You may. Thank you. Looking for somethin'? I didn't think you heard me. Heh. I heard ya. Beautiful night, isn't it? Yeah. Say, Seton, I was just getting a drink of water, and Jesse grabbed the dipper and gave the water barrel a couple of whacks. Now why did he do that? Oh, that's an old trick of his. You see, when he bangs the barrel, the polliwogs all go down to the bottom. Polliwogs? Oh, well. You miss the mountains, don't you, Seton? Miss them? I was born in 'em, raised in 'em, married in 'em, had my kids in 'em. Where's your family now? See, I'm a... I'm what they call a "squaw man." I married me a full-blooded Sioux. One night, when I was out huntin', a bunch of Arapahos raided our village. And when I got back, the only thing left alive was old Jesse there. They'd cut his tongue out so he couldn't tell me nothing about it. That was a long time ago. Yes, sir, a long time ago. Well, son, wherever I go, I always carry the mountains around inside me. Hmm. Man carries a heap of things around inside him. Heap of things. You fool! You, put that gun down! You got a hankerin' to join them burned-out wagons, Mr. Wayne? Why'd they come riding up in the middle of the night? Just to look us over. That's all. It's a good thing you ain't worth a hoot with a rifle. Why didn't they start shootin' when Brother Decker did? When you fire a gun in the air, that's a sign of peace to an Injun. They-they can see your gun ain't loaded. They thought it was me fired the shot. Jesse, get all the horses inside the circle.Mmm. May I walk with you to your wagon, Miss Prudence? Thank you, Mr. Wayne. Mr. Harris? Mr. Harris? Were those real wild Indians? Oh, no, Richard. They were friendly Indians.Darn. Anything I can do for you, sir? How many times have I told you not to "sir" me? Force of habit. Sorry. Is anything wrong, sir? Grandma Cooper. Has she had these fevers before? Twice since we've been on the trail. Here, ma'am. You take this and it might do you some good. Think she'll be all right?

Thanks for tellin' me. Come on, boy. It's weather like this makes me homesick for my rose garden in Warwickshire. But... Yeah. Sometimes I wish I were back in Nashville practicing law again. Well, to matters of state. Your government's latest proposal on the Oregon question is completely unacceptable. Why do you concern yourself with so distant a frontier? The government of England concerns itself with frontiers even more distant. That is our tradition, Mr. President. And this is our country, Mr. Ambassador. You may convey to Her Majesty's government my counter-proposal, that the boundary of the Oregon territory be established at latitude 54 degrees, 40 minutes. And that, sir, is final. There is no alternative? 54, 40, Sir Richard. Or what? Or fight. Is this your water, Seton? Be quiet, Decker. Be quiet? Be quiet? We paid good money to have this bumbler guide us through the wilderness! This is all his fault! How far to the next water, Seton? Five days, maybe six. We'll collect all the water we got on the train. We'll ration it from my wagon. How can you stand that whiskey at a time like this? Whiskey ain't hard to stand any time. For you maybe. There's a doctor at Fort Laramie. How long do you think it'll take to get there? Two weeks maybe. Two weeks. That's four. That's five. Four. How's Grandma Cooper? Fever hasn't broken. Give her this. That's your ration. She needs it more than I do. Seton says there's a creek bed about a mile south of here. With any luck, we'll be back with some water. Hah. That, sir, was my best specimen. The only one in leaf! You coyote. People dyin' of thirst, and you stealin' their water. It's my ration. You dirty, thievin' coyote. It's my own ration! I only used my own ration! Stop it!

Well, you've got quite an audience, Ellis. Yes. I don't know much about guns, but that certainly is an impressive-looking weapon. One of these is equal to six guns. You mean, instead of being able to fire it only once, you can fire it six times? That's right. A new type. A fella named Sam Colt made 'em. How's it work? Every time you pull the hammer back, it puts a new round in position. "Round"? A bullet. Oh. Watch this. Move over, Johnny. Wow! Can you do that again, Mr. Ellis? Anything for you, Lucy honey. Well, you're quite a shot, Ellis. And that's quite a gun. Ellis! You know better than that. Yes, sir. Mr. Wayne, I was looking at Ellis' gun. I noticed it has "B Company" stamped on it. That means it's government property, doesn't it? Or am I mistaken? Your mistake could be in asking. Questions seem to bother you a lot, Mr. Wayne. Only the man who asks them. Well, that's too bad, because my livelihood happens to depend on questions. Then I suggest you go back East and ask them. Out here, questions can get you killed. Whoa. Ho. What's that? It's a warnin'. Old friends, Jesse. The Arapaho. They, uh, they want somethin'. What do they want, horses, goods? What? They want me. Ellis! Brizzard! They... They was... They was only one. Are you sure? Dead sure. You take over from here in. Head for that saddle o'er in the hills. You can see Fort Laramie from there. Thank... Oh, thanks, Harris. Well, Jesse, so you had your revenge, did you? And they had theirs. Revenge is... no good. No good for nobody. No good... Jesse, take up your position in the rear. Our wagons'll be in the lead from now on. You're riding in the rear too, Mr. Harris. Wayne. It's pretty obvious to me now just who you are and why you're with this train. I gave you an order, Mr. Harris. I intend to send a dispatch to my paper, the Herald, at the earliest opportunity. I shall do my best to explain in my story that every evidence points to your being in command of a detail of soldiers. I can tear up your dispatch, sir. And I can write another one, Captain Wayne. That is your rank, isn't it? Brizzard. Yes, sir. Take charge of Mr. Harris. See if you can persuade him to stay close to his wagon. I won't let him out of my sight. After you, Mr. Harris. Miss Prudence. Miss Prudence. Not you. Your sister. Neal. I thought you were under guard. Canvas walls do not a prison make, nor wagon spokes a cage. I'm sorry to get you up this time of night. I wanted to say goodbye. Goodbye? Mr. Harris. Ah, Mr. Wayne. Isn't it past your bedtime? I told you to stay in Seton's wagon. Oh, I was just out getting a breath of fresh air. Well, I shall rejoin Mr. Brizzard who was catching 40 winks when I left. Charming companion, Mr. Brizzard. Charming. Good night, Miss Prudence. Mr. Wayne. Captain. You're drunk. Oh, no, Captain. Where's your gun, your knife? And your horse. My horse is gone. Daisy. That means Harris is gone, too. Under military regulations, I could have you shot. Take my horse. You're going after him. Tonight? Tonight! Yes, sir. And if you have to, shoot him. It'd be my pleasure. Don't you try to run away again, now, or I'll beat you worse than I ever beat your squaw mother. Now get off and water them horses. Just you try to run away again. Howdy, Gabe. Where's all the soldiers? Place looks dead, Clayman. Don't know for sure. They just upped and went and rode south. That so? They comin' back? Took everything with them, including most of my business. You ain't just tellin' me this to cut the price of my furs, are you, Clayman? Them furs is all right, but, uh... Who is going to buy them? You are. Well, how do you do? My name's Neal Harris, and this is my traveling companion, Daisy. I guess she doesn't speak English, Daisy. Of course, I don't speak Indian either, so that makes us even. I don't really think that makes too much difference though, do you? I mean, take you and me. You don't understand English, and I don't understand horse. But we get along very well together. You know, I'd never seen an Indian until just recently. Of course, I'd seen a lot of pictures of them and all that, but never a real, live Indian. I didn't realize they could be so beautiful. You are very beautiful. Thank you, Mr. Harris. Now, that wasn't fair. Daisy, I knew that was going to happen. I just knew it. Had enough? Now take them furs and get out of here. You ain't gonna shoot nobody, Clayman, especially me. Guess you was hopin' he'd have guts enough to kill your old pa, eh, Shona? Someone will kill you sooner or later. Just you wait till I get you home in the mountains. Just you wait. Now give me that $100. It's a fair price. But I, I ain't got $100. All right then, I'll beat it out of ya. Just a minute, gentlemen. I don't wish to interfere with what may be normal business procedure here in the West, but I have a suggestion which may be a little less bloodthirsty. Who are you? My name's Harris. I'm a newspaperman. I have to send a dispatch to New York. And there are certain people who might try to stop me from sending it. So here's my proposition. I'll give you $100 for your furs and another $100 on top of it if you'll see to it my dispatch gets to the telegraph man at Westport. I'll get it back there for ya. Give me the money. I'll pay as soon as I finish writing it. It'll take a while. Now just a minute, stranger. Any deal made in this store entitles me to a commission. You can have the furs for a commission. Huh? Paper and ink is right on the table. Thank you. Giddy-up. They must have pulled out right after I left. Is there another way out of the stockade? For an extra commission, there is. For another hundred, I could hide you in Shona's village. I guess Bennett can afford it. All right, I'll give you another hundred. You're not going to hide him with them redskins, are you? What's wrong with them? Bring the horses around to the back. Hmm. The place seems to be abandoned. Take over, Carmichael. Yes, sir. Six. Sept. Where are all the soldiers? Pulled out, all of them. Huit. Any message for George Wayne? I'll find out. All I've got is a letter here for a Capitaine George Wayne. I'm Captain Wayne. You don't look like a capitaine. A funny thing... When the soldiers moved out, some of them were saying, "Remember the Alamo." What... What is an Alamo? Look, Sis. Jawbreakers. Prudence, I've got to talk to you alone. Hey, look, Dad. Jawbreakers. You want some jawbreakers, son? Huh? Yeah? How much are they? Penny apiece. How many you want? Is that the cheapest you've got? How much cheaper can you get than a penny apiece? Well, you couldn't let us have just one for nothing, could you? What's the matter? Don't you even have a penny? No, sir. Then why did you ask me for the price, eh? I didn't know what else to say. Well, that's the craziest thing I ever heard of. Who gives something for nothing to somebody I never even saw in my life? I-I don't know what kind of people are coming to the West these days. Just because their kid wants some candy, somebody wants me to dig right down into my pocket... and-and just g-give some... Come here, boy. The Oregon boundary question has been settled. And I'm... Well, I'm under new orders now. And you have to return East. Not East. South. We're at war with Mexico. Wa... Prudence, I... Nobody knows how long this war is going to last, and I... Well, that is, I-I... No matter how long, darling, I'll wait. In Oregon? Oregon or anywhere else on this Earth. Brizzard! Brizzard! What are they doing to this man? We've gotta turn him loose, Hastings. I don't think they'll take kindly to that. You've gotta do something. He's in a bad way. Wait a minute! Call them off me! Tell 'em... What are you doing? You... You won't be needin' this. You damn renegade! Kick and squirm. You'll have plenty of time to squirm, like us mountain men always squirm when the butchers kill off our buffalo and our game, and the soldiers drive the Indians off their own Earth to starve and die. Anything you want, just yell. Brizzard. Yeah. What do you think they're gonna do with us? Why don't you ask Big Chief Tall Hat? I'm not joking. Maybe you think I am. Tied here two days. Wait till tomorrow when your tongue starts to swell. Maybe there won't be a tomorrow. Thought you might want a drink. I wish I had my whip and was facin' you. Now you say you're sorry, soldier. Wanna say you're sorry? You wanna say you're sorry, soldier? Go ahead, Brizzard. It's no disgrace to be thirsty. I'm sorry. Good. That's better. Now say it again, and I'll turn you loose. How many times do I gotta say it? Lots and lots. I'm sorry. Now get up, soldier. What are you gonna do with him? Seems you oughta reckon what I'm gonna do with you. Shona! Why are you doing this for me? I guess that answers my question. We must hurry. They are gone. Who are "they"? My father is leading the young warriors to the fort. All will be killed if we don't warn them. Can we get there ahead of them? We'll ride fast. Come. The Indians are on their way to attack the fort! On what do you base your information? The girl, Shona. I was captured. So was Brizzard. She cut me loose. It's true, Captain Wayne. Lippert. Break out those new revolvers. See that every man in the wagon train gets one. Instruct them as best you can on how to load and fire them. Yes, sir. Break out those revolvers. Yes, sir. I want you men with the Colt revolvers to take up your positions along those walls. If the Indians should storm the gate or scale the walls, I want you to fall back to those two buildings and keep them in a cross fire. There they are! Just remember, each one of those revolvers has six shots. Make 'em count! Take up your positions. There they are! I can see 'em! Hey, Pop! We can see 'em! Hey, you boys, get down outta there! Aw, heck. Darn. There's a wagon coming, Captain. Who's in it? I can only see the driver. Hyah! It's Brizzard! Open the gates for him. I wonder how he got away with a wagon. They're sending in the first wave! Get those gates closed! It's a trap! They're in the wagon! Fire on 'em! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! The second wave, Captain! Hey, Spars! Get that powder wagon to the gate. Saxon. Drive those mules to the gate! Hey, you kids, get inside! Get out of there! Dad! Dad! Dad! Ow! Ow! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! I hate you! I hate you! Garrison. It is because of this, I renounce my people. Forward! I already made arrangements with Clayman to get my dispatch back to Westport, and also my resignation. ♪ One hundred years and more have gone ♪ ♪ One hundred years and ten ♪ ♪ But time can never dim the fame ♪ ♪ Of those heroic men ♪ Who never faltered on the trail ♪ ♪ Until the West was won ♪ Those men of old in wagons rolled ♪ ♪ Rolled west to Oregon ♪ Oregon, Oregon ♪ Oregon ♪ Oregon Captioned by Point.360
