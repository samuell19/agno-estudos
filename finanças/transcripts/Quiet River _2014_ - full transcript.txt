And so it happened I found myself at a crossroads. Things hadn't gone well for my husband and I and we needed a break. So I packed up everything and went back south. I hadn't been there in 10 years. I was hoping maybe the tight spaces would help hold me in. The thing is, I was right. It was like a friend of mine once said, it was a good idea that didn't work out. Nice ax. - I'm going to put this away now. This is the inside. It's nice. - Mm-hmm, yes. - Did you do this all yourself, or? - Oh no no no no no, my skills tend more towards the intellectual and the monetary-- - How long have you been here? - Oh, a couple of years. Mm-hmm. Your shoes are very dirty. - Well I was, I walked here through the mud, so. - And your hair. - What about my hair? - Well, it's just very unkempt for your standards. - Jesus, Daniel. - Which, which I don't-- - Wow. - I don't think is a bad thing, it's not a value judgment, it's simply unusual. - Mm-hmm, great thanks. - How is what's his name? - Neil? - Mm-hmm. - He's fine. Hmm. - He's fine we-- - Mm-hmm. - What, we just decided to take a breath, you know? - Oh, yes, yes. And here you are. - Here I am. - Here you are alone. Away from Neil. - Why do you say it like that? - Well I've always said it like that. You probably didn't hear when you were next to him and now that you have gained some distance. But, that's all right, that's probably time for that-- - Can I? Can I put my stuff down? - Oh yes, yes, you can put it down anywhere. Great, thanks. Will you be here very long? - Actually I could use a place to stay for a while. I mean, not not a long time, just... Mm-hmm. Neil is really mad at me right now, so. - Why? - You know how things build up, and... And then. Anyway, it's your fault. - It is? - Yeah. - How? - Not, no, I, it was just a, it was a stupid joke, I'm sorry. Hmm. - You know, growing up with you it was just like brutal truth kinda. - Well I don't think you can expect that from everyone. I don't think you've ever come to me for help before. Yeah. - You were the normal one. - Oh, come on. Unbelievable. It was tough to let things go. When I was with people I wanted to be alone. When I was alone the nagging came back. The bottomless feeling that my life had fallen away when my back was turned. Mornin'. - There was one summer when mom had all those vegetables in the garden and she was always weeding and she never could figure out why. And she finally quit. And it was because she was not weeding well, she was not pulling up the roots. She was only pulling off the green. - I see. It's a lot more work though. - It is, but you only have to do it once. - I thought you liked living in the city. - No I didn't really like anything about living in the city. I think it was necessary for work and research, and necessary for connections, but it was, I never. All the people. - People can be good for you, you know. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - No more satellites. - No. Well, they're up there somewhere. They just don't have my name on them anymore. I think if they don't have my name on them I would rather be here. - No more people, no more city, no more-- - No no, once they got interested in the parabolic ideas and they ceased to become my ideas and became their property I wanted to be somewhere where my ideas were my own ideas and no one else could buy them from me. It doesn't hurt that somebody did buy them. - No, well somebody did so here I am. - Right. And you know, if you ever got sick of it the road's right there, so. - They told me it wasn't very much trafficked and anyway this was the only property with the two structures. I didn't know if I was going to live in the... I hate the road. - The old town. River town. Things hadn't changed here in 30 years. Or 30,000. I couldn't figure out if that was a good thing or not. Part of my wanted to see it again. Part of me wanted to know if I had any idea what the hell I was doing back here. Ruby? - Claire? I know, right? - Wow, what are you doing here? - Wow, oh my gosh. Yeah. - What are you doing here? I'm just visiting, you know? - Wow, yeah. - Yeah. - I haven't seen you, how long have you been here? - I just got in yesterday, so. Yeah, and you're staying with Daniel? - Mm-hmm. - Oh all right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, well, you know, he's our neighbor. - Really? - Yeah. - Wow. - Listen, yeah. Well it's just, I'm so shocked to see you. - I know, it's-- - Okay, all right. Well, uh-- - You look amazing. - Well thanks, so do you. I mean, it's like, I mean, it's a time warp because you're here but you look the same. Nothing has changed. Gosh. So... Gosh, you busy? - No. Nope. So, what are you, what are you up to, it's-- Why am I still in this town? No, I-- - Yes. - No. Yes. Yeah, Charlie Anderson, did you know him? You know, the name sounds familiar-- - He's a little bit older than us, yeah. Anyway. Fell in love and never left, you know. - You're still here. - I am. Who would have thunk it, certainly not me. You were smart. No, I'm kidding. This town does drive me crazy but I mean, I feel really lucky. Charlie, fell in love with him, and stuck around. - That's really, I'm glad-- - How's Neil, how's Neil? - He's fine. Good good, tell him I said hi. - Yeah, okay. Is he still doing his thing? - Still, still Neil, yeah. - Yeah, definitely say hello from me. - Yeah. - Never would have thought you two would have wound up together. There is, there is something I feel like I need to share, Claire. So also on our land, you know, it's a pretty large property and we're trying to maintain it and keep up the farm and venting is, it's expensive. And one of the, so we've been doing some other stuff on the property, some forestry work and it's not real popular in town. People are not real pleased with us right now, and someone's been dumping poison down our well. And, yeah, it's herbicide actually. - Jesus. - And so um... - That's, I'm I'm sorry, that-- - Thanks, I appreciate that. The part I really feel like I need to tell you is the prime suspect is actually Daniel. And-- - Oh. - I'm sorry. Has he mentioned anything? - No. - Yeah, I didn't think he would, but I just wanted you to hear it from me. It's awful, it's terrible, I hate it. It just makes my chest tight, you know? His land borders ours. You know, you've you've been gone a long time. And I don't blame you, trust me I don't blame you. But I mean, Daniel's changed a lot, you know, I mean. He's really, he's gotten really radical. Really really strong beliefs and really saying them out loud a lot. He actually ran into Charlie on the dirt road a month or two ago and was really, flagged him down. Charlie felt a little scared. He was so vocal and started talking about the historical significance of well poisoning, I didn't even know. Apparently like in the 13th century they would dump bodies down wells, war tactics. You should know the police have been out to see him, and I want you to know that. - He didn't, didn't say. Wow. - I'm sorry. It just makes me, it makes me sick in my stomach, it hurts my heart, it just-- - Don't apologize. - I feel awful, I feel awful, I mean, his land borders ours. I was caught off balance. But something inside fell right into place. It sounded like Daniel, it felt like Daniel. In one moment, I saw how the framework of his ideas could get him into real trouble. Daniel? Yes. - What are you doing? - I am attempting to tidy up. - I just talked to Ruby. - Ah, yes. Yes. Yeah, she had some pretty interesting things to say. - Yes, I imagine she did. - Yeah, she told me about, she told me that you are accused of poisoning their well, Daniel. Mm-hmm. - Do you want to explain what's going on? Well, well poisoning has a long history, a long tradition, a very-- - No, I don't want to hear the history of well poisoning Daniel, I want you to tell me if it's true. - No. I mean, not that I had anything to do with it. I don't think it's a terrible idea, but I didn't have anything to do with it. - They're investigating you. Well-- - The police, right? So, thank you for your concern. - You can't, you can't treat this lightly, Daniel. I'm sorry, but it seems like you're, you have a very-- Tidying up, yes I am, thank you. I have some more tidying to do now. - This... Hey. Hey. - You realize you're on private property? - No. - What's your name? - It's Claire. - Claire? Yeah. - Why haven't I seen you around before? - Probably because I just got here. - Where you headed? - Just home. - Home? Mm-hmm. - Where's home? I mean, I can give you a ride if you, I wasn't-- No, it. I guess you won't get lost with a coat like that. Sorry. - No, it's bright. - I'm Barrett. - Barrett, hello. Well-- - What are you doing later? - Nothin'. Daniel. - Yes. - You awake? - Yes, I'm awake. What is it? - Never mind. Knock knock. Hm, mm-hmm. No rest for the wicked, I see. - No no, I do like to have things going, projects for the... - Did you sleep okay? - Mm-hmm, yes. Yes. I did sleep okay, did you sleep okay? - You know, I had a lot of bad dreams actually. You know, my mind just wouldn't shut up. Mm-hmm. - I keep thinking about what Ruby said, you know? I mean-- - Ah, yes. - Why would, why would she say that about you? - Mm, well I'm sure Ruby has many reasons for doing many things that she does. - Right, but I just don't understand. I just don't understand. Well I don't think there's too much to understand. It's what they call a local matter. - Right. But if it gets out of hand Daniel, I mean, you're by yourself out here, and... - Well, being alone out here is very much the point. - Are you gonna do anything about it, Daniel? I mean-- - Well. This is what I'm doing. - Right. Daniel didn't have a hostile bone in his body. He wasn't angry or vindictive. But growing up with him, there were moments. * I don't leave the highway long enough * * To bog down in the mud * I got ramblin' fever in my blood * * Caught this ramblin' fever long ago * * When I first heard the lonesome whistle blow * * Some folks never ever gave a damn * * They damn sure told you wrong * * I've had ramblin' fever all along * * Ramblin' * Fever * The kind that can't be measured by degree * * Ramblin' fever * There ain't no kind of cure for my disease * * There's times I'd like to bed down on a sofa * * And let some pretty lady rub my back * * And in the early morning drinking coffee * * Talkin' about when I'll be coming back * * I don't let no woman tie me down * * Never get too old to get around * * Want to die along the highway * - Anybody home? Hello. Daniel. Daniel? I felt dirty coming in here. Sneaking around. Like I'd found someone's stash of girly magazines. The more I looked, the more I felt that solitude had not been good for Daniel. People lose themselves when they're isolated and alone, like a plant starving for light in some forgotten corner. You thirsty? Yeah, sure. - One of my finest reserve here. - Thanks. So, what's this for? - Oh, it comes in handy once in a while. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Did you make it or? - Yeah. It's forged out of a single piece. - Impressive. - It does the job. - You used it yet? - Sure, couple times. - Really? - Yeah. In preparation for the impending collapse. - The collapse. - I don't know, I just figure we're not gonna have a lot of, you know, guns and that kind of thing once everything goes to shit, so-- - Which is-- - I try to train with-- Bound to happen. - Absolutely it is. Look at the way people treat the land and our economy, I mean, come on, you know. - Planning for the end of the world. - Yeah. I'm kind of looking forward to it, actually. I'm an apocal-optimist. A what? - An apocal-optimist, I think it'll be-- That's a new one. - I think it'll be nicer, you know, after the dust settles. - That sounds familiar. Do you know anything about re-wilding? - Yeah, I've heard of re-wilding. Yeah. So, I mean, what is that? - Just the idea that I guess if you wanted to reduce it to its lowest common denominator you could say that it's the idea of letting nature, truly allowing nature to take its course. Maybe you help it along even, a little bit. Removing certain obstacles from its path. - Like people, or? - Maybe. You go about it the right way, I mean, it, not in every case. - What's the right way? - I'm just, you know, the idea that okay, look you know, a house gets old and falls down and then the vines grow over it and they help weaken it and it crumbles and rots and decays and goes back into the ground. - Okay. - You know. And then eventually it's like it was never there at all. You know, perfect, serene. The way it was supposed to be in the first place. - Hm. I see. - Well Ruby's place down there. You can't tell me that that land is gonna be prettier after that development goes in. I didn't know she was putting-- - Why do you think she's clear cutting the side of the mountain. - I don't know. Huh. - It's senseless, I mean, line your pockets for that. And then those people, they're gonna put two, they'll cover the side of the mountain in the $2 million homes, put a big ugly gate at the bottom of the hill. And then we'll have to look at those eyesores all year long when those people aren't gonna be in them but three months. When they can get to them, you know, in the summer. - Oh, I didn't know that, I thought. - I'm not gonna tell somebody else what to do on their land, but I don't think, it's not what I would do. You can't do that to the land without it finally having enough and turning back on you. - I didn't know that was happening. Seems like a lot of people are not happy with that. - You blame 'em? - Yeah. - Shh sh-sh-sh. So you think about this. Would something be a modern application of a primitive warfare technique or a primitive application of a modern warfare technique. Either way you look at it it's always a soft kill weapon that's used when you're messing with somebody's water supply. It's easy, you can use an animal carcass, or a diseased person that's died in the battle. Just throw it down the well and whether it's you poisoning somebody else's well, shh, come here. Shh, come here, come here. There we go. Open up. It's not that hard to make sure that they can't use that water anymore. Know what I mean? Go on, girl. - Ah! No. Stop, wait, wait, this is not, this is, these are, this is. And my, these, these are mine, this is my my my my my writing, my ideas, these are my, I will not, my ideas are no longer for consumption by anyone, by the government, by corporations, by... They are not to be shared anyone. They are my, I, not for government nor corporation nor, nor, nor-- - I was just. Wow. I'm sorry, I just, it was-- - It doesn't surprise me at all that your marriage is in such, you you... - What? You know what, I don't want to hear it. Look, I, I should have known, I should have known. You've been alone for awhile, I just. - It must have been, it must have been easier for you. When I left you must have, what was it? It must have been easier. - Well, I don't, I mean... You going to school before me that, and I... There's nothing really easy about... I don't mean, I know that-- - A younger brother, who-- - You were, but because they, they they they... I took up a lot of attention. Well. - Not... It was probably unnecessary. But once, once I was at school you had your life. It's a good thing. It's a good thing that you're here. I knew I could keep piecing things together, looking around for some answer that may never come. Or I could just call her. - Hello? Hello? - Yeah hi, this is Claire. - Oh, Claire, hey how are you? Um, I'm good. I'm good. - Good. - How are you? - Oh, I'm good, good, good. What's up? - Well, I was just wondering if, if you and I could, well, I was just, I thought that maybe I, you and I could have um, I could come over for dinner? Maybe I could have dinner with you and Charlie. - You want to come over to dinner? - Well, yeah. I thought it would be fun, you know, catch up. - Well, oh-- - Share a meal, break some bread. Are you wanting to come tonight? - Look, I don't make a habit out of inviting myself over to people's houses, I just, it's just been such a long time since, since I got to spend any time with you, so what do you say? Please. - Thanks. I'm sorry I'm so early, I just, was running around and just thought. - It's fine, Claire, it's not a problem at all. We're glad you're here. - Wow. This is a beautiful house. - Well thank you, thank you very much. This is where I was born. The only house I've ever known. - Really. - Yep. Used to roll around and wrestle with my brothers right here on the floor. Listen, have a seat, please. - Oh, thank you. So, you grew up here. - Yes, I did. And before we had the horse farm, we actually used to keep, because we got about six acres across the creek, and that's where we used to keep horses. When we were first starting out where we weren't really doing as much breeding as we are now. And yeah, a lot of great memories here. It's a wonderful place to grow up. Funny thing, I can remember being a kid and when we first put the horses in the back pasture that we had the electric fence running around and I had a friend who didn't understand that it was probably not a good thing to take a piss on the electric fence. And so that's definitely seared in my memory, and his also I think, of growing up here, but it was a lot of good stories like that, a lot of good friends, lot of good, lot of good people here, so. - That sounds really great. - Yeah, it was a wonderful place. - I know this is probably way... Are you sure about my brother? - Claire, excuse me, how 'bout I get you guys a glass of wine. - Yeah. - Would that be all right? - Yeah, I think that'd be great, thank you. - Excuse me. - Thanks. - Claire. I'm sorry-- - No, it was a surprise. I just, I'm just trying to understand exactly what's going on. So I didn't-- - Sure, absolutely. I understand that, he's your brother. I mean, he rides all over our property. We see his ATV all around. We don't see anyone else. I mean, you know the types of things he says. And he's certainly made it no big secret that he's not a fan of ours. - I mean, there are things that are happening that... - I know, and I know that you probably don't agree and I don't want to make this even more awkward than it already is, but-- - No no no, it's your property, I get it. - Yes. We have bills to pay just like everybody else does. - I know and it's... I can't imagine... I just wish there was, it just doesn't seem like enough. Enough what? - Enough. - I wish he wasn't, I wish that it was someone else. I wish that it was someone we didn't know or somebody we didn't like, I just. All we want is clean water, Claire. - Maybe this is maybe out of line, I don't know, but you know what Daniel is like. And I just don't want to see this thing escalate out of control and have him... - What? - Nothing. No, nothing. - Ah, we been friends a long time, honey. I don't want this to ruin it between us. Stay for dinner. Just stay. We won't talk about this anymore. We'll just put it aside. I've cooked a lovely dinner. We'll turn on some music, we'll drink some wine, we'll talk about old times. Please. Ruby's farm. Prime, relatively horizontal riverfront mountain real estate. Hard to come by around here. It wasn't as big as some, I guess. What I was looking for, I had no idea. * Said I been walking down your roads for days * * And I swear I'm gonna die of thirst * * I been shittin' in the one hand and wishin' in the other * * I can tell you which offend the first * * If waking up could change me * By that I see a change in you * * If what I do not know * Cannot hurt me, oh Lord * I think I'd rather be a fool * Well well well * What I do not know * Cannot hurt me oh * I think I'd rather be a fool No, we been playing for a year, year and a half, something like that. Sounding good. - We're having fun with it. You know what you throw a drowning bass player? - What? - His amp. - Thanks. - Wet your whistle. - You read my mind. So are you gonna take your band on tour, or? - We'll see. See what happens. Take it as it comes, huh? - It's not my main drive right now, I've got a lot on my plate, you know. It's just a fun way to make extra money right now. - Doesn't sound like a bad way to live. - Do what you love you'll never work a day in your life, right? - Cheers to that. So, I've got a question for you. - Shoot. - I came across this stuff called Atrazine. - Atrazine? Yes, thank you. - That came out of nowhere. I know. I'm using you for your knowledge. - Oh, well I am a walking compendium of useless information. Atrazine, that's some nasty shit. It's an herbicide, you know, commercial farmers use it all the time. At least over here, they banned it in Europe like 10 years ago. Yeah, they say it's supposed to biodegrade in a year. But it keeps turning up in ground water long after that expiration date. - Oh, really? - Yeah. So it poisons the drinking water, you know, a lot of times in the areas where it's used. - And it gets stuck in the water? - Oh yeah, yeah. Stuck in the ground water, watersheds, you know, it's a lot of nasty side effects. - Like what? - Birth defects, sure. I've read, you know, a lot of reproductive harm. Infertility in women. They did a study, right. They dosed all these African clawed frogs with the stuff. And out of all of the frogs they did, 75 % of the male frogs turned up sterile. And this is really weird, like one out of every 10 of these frogs turned hermaphroditic. - Really. - Yeah, so. Yeah, I'd stay away from it. - No, that sounds like your kind of frog though. What do you mean? - Well it doesn't have to rely on anybody for anything. - Oh. Have to be kind of flexible, wouldn't it? - Maybe, but. But it would... I mean, as far as putting it in well water, it wouldn't. No, I'm sure that happens all the time. There's an ass for ever seat. You know, there's nasty people all over the world. - Yeah. - You want another beer? Sure. What's going on? - Can I help you ma'am? - I'm sorry, I'm Claire Dunbar. I'm Daniel's sister. Is he okay? - He's fine, I'm just stopping by to talk to him. - He's not being arrested or anything is he? There aren't any-- - No. - Charges, okay. - No charges. - You realize that my brother is not like everybody else, so I'm just trying to understand. I didn't realize things had gotten this far. I just need to know where he stands, I mean is that? - I understand your brother's special needs, I do. Okay. - The law doesn't differentiate here. He's a person of interest in a DA investigation. No charges. Okay. - But he is a person of interest. - So. I mean. I guess I just, I'm wondering what comes next. - Keep him out of trouble, keep him in town. And that's it. - It's about all you can do. - So-- - He's in a lot of trouble potentially. I just need, I need you to be a good sister to him and make sure that he stays in town. - Okay. - You might want to get him a lawyer. - Okay. - You're not driving that thing on the road, are you? - No, of course not, just... - Right. - All right. Daniel. Mm-hmm. You can't ignore this. - Well, Claire, I'm not going to ignore it. Okay. - I'm going to live my life, and... Do you even understand how serious this situation is? - Yes Claire, he was very succinct in his clarification of the seriousness. - Okay. So what are you gonna do about it? - Well. There's very little to be done except to continue to not have done it. Which I will be doing. - Daniel, look at me. This is not in your control. This is not going away. You could be... You could go to jail. - Mm-hmm, no no. No, I don't think so. - If they arrest you, you're going to jail. - No no no, no no I will not be going to jail, Claire. I am not going to be arrested. - That's not a decision that you can make. - Mm-hmm, yes. Yes yes, there are any number of steps one can take to not go to prison, I-- - Daniel, stop. Just stop. Jesus Christ. - I do live in the mountains now, Claire. - Daniel. What are you... - I'm not going to go to prison, Claire. I'm not going to go to prison. I don't think it would be good for me. - How's it going? - Look, I know this isn't really your... But it's, it's my brother. I mean, he's in the middle of this whole thing, and-- - And you think I can help? Well, I, yeah. I'm hoping that maybe-- - 'Cause I can't. - Well I'm not asking for you to-- You kind of are. Asking me to help your brother, it's kind of like asking me to get involved. But you live here. - That doesn't. Your brother understands, your brother would do the same thing for me. - He should-- - He would mind his own business and stay out of it. - Look, I'm not looking for... - You're looking for help. - What's happening right now is what's happening-- You're looking for, am I right? You're looking for help. - Yes, yes, okay. - I can't. Why? - 'Cause it's not what I do. Your brother would understand. Your brother and I are more alike than you think. But I, I'm not him, so I-- - He would do the same for me. - I'm sick of just, that's enough of that. What I'm asking for is just, I don't know. You're, you live here, you're- - You're asking for me to get involved in something that I can't get involved in. - Why? Because I don't get involved in things. I am not him, and he could end up... - Incarcerated? - I mean, don't you see what could, yes. - Yeah, I do understand. He should have been a lot more careful. And I hate it for you but there's really nothing I can do. - I just... - It's how people survive. Alone? - Yeah. One person's a lot easier to take care of than a whole group of people. - That is just so-- - It makes a lot more sense. Look, I'm sorry about your brother. I'm not gonna get involved. - Right. Okay. Thanks. - Good luck. - Daniel? Daniel. Daniel? Okay. This is what we're gonna do. Do you have a tie? - Oh, hello. - Hi. Come in, please. Thank you. Do you have an appointment? No, we don't actually. - Ah, and who are you again? - Oh I'm sorry. This is Daniel Crouse, my brother. I'm Claire Dunbar. - Daniel and Claire. - Yes. My brother owns the property near Ruby Samuel's place. - Oh. Yeah, local ADA told me about that case. I must tell you it's very unusual for us to discuss matters with someone who's involved in an investigation. - Oh-- - In fact, your being here without your attorney present is ill advised. But we can continue if you'd like. - Yes, yes. We, yes. I understand that charges might be brought against Daniel and that he, that he might... Well I guess I just don't understand what happens next, so. - I'll tell you what I tell everyone else. In criminal matters we conduct an investigation. We look into allegations. If we find evidence of an indictable offense then we issue a warrant. - A warrant? - For the arrest of the suspect. - Oh. Okay, but, my brother isn't, he... It's just... Daniel has Asberger's, I really think that-- - No I don't, I don't. - Yes you do. - No I don't. - You do. - No, no I don't. - Yes-- - I don't have-- - You do, you do. - I don't, I don't. My, my my my sister is trying to help in her own way but she doesn't understand how she affects the, when she says certain things. It isn't even a viable diagnosis anymore, it's-- - We were just, were just wondering-- - I can't-- - We. If there was any way that. I mean, obviously you have a... We were just wondering if there was anything that we can do. - If your brother is found to be a suspect in a criminal act then he will be arrested. But at this point the investigation is-- - But he didn't do it. I mean, he. Did you? - It's obviously not really the point of this. It's not, look this man obviously has no imagination. All he can see is is is me here, is is this, is the town recluse whose so-called private property abuts their so-called private property. There isn't much, that's all he has. And for two years now he hasn't seen the clear cutting, the roads, the construction that's all illegal-- - He, he, he isn't poisoning their well. He isn't. - We only consider information and evidence collected by qualified law enforcement officers. We don't favor anyone. We don't hold a grudge against anyone. If your brother is found to be the most likely suspect in damaging someone else's property and they choose to press charges, we will formally file them and he will be prosecuted. With legal representation and the assumption of being innocent until proven guilty. - There must be something else. I mean, there must be something that we-- - The new MSD probably won't even include Asperger's as its own definition. It's simply not, it was only invented in the 1940s, popularized in the '80s and '90s. It's only, it's an invention of the pharmaceutical company to sell their product to more people, to sell drugs to children. It has nothing to do, the autism spectrum as traditionally defined, of which Asperger's is now considered a part, is far more concerned with language development, with cog, with cog, it's... When when, when you, when you leave, when you leave my house you... Tomorrow, tomorrow is fine. Tomorrow will be, tomorrow will be fine. Mm-hmm. I will give you, I will give you some money. Mm-hmm. - Hello. - Hey, it's me. - Okay. - No, there was just something that I never got around to talking to you about last night. What? All right, you know how Ruby is. Pretty much everybody in this town's done some work for her at some point or another. - Okay. - You know that old house on their property? There's something up there you might want to take a look at. - I thought, I thought we were all, you know, on our own. - We are. That doesn't mean we can't do each other a favor once in a while. Anyway, I just thought you might want to sneak up there and poke around. - Daniel and I are done, I'm leaving. - Well maybe you should go look around up there. - Why are you telling me all this? - Let's just say I didn't want you to think all anarchists are assholes. - I had heard about this place. Somebody'd won it in a bad divorce. Let it fall down rather than give it to the ex. That was when I had it. Well poisoning. Insurance. Settlements. And they needed somebody to blame. With a plan like Ruby's, the payout would be huge. You and me need to talk. We need to talk about something, you and me. - Claire. I'm busy. - Meet me at the top of your road in an hour. Meet me at the top of your road in an hour. Do it. - Claire, I'm-- What Claire, what do you want? - I want you to drop the charges. - Why would I do that? - I know about the Atrazine, Ruby. - Atra, Atra, I don't even know what that is. What are you talking about? What's your brother told you? What kind of crazy did he? Claire. I get it. I understand. You're here in town because your life is broken, your home is gone, your nest is gone and you're jealous of mine-- - Drop the charges and everyone walks away. - Fine. Fine, Claire. Whatever the fuck you want. Have a nice life. - Hey. You, you're packing? - I'll be out of here in just a minute. Mm-hmm. - You know, I don't think anyone's gonna bother your out here, so. - Mm-hmm. Well, I do recognize that it it isn't going away. - I wouldn't worry about it. - Well, I won't. Good. That's good. - I don't think Neil... Neil, he's all right. - I know. There's this window in our kitchen. And right outside of it this spider had made this huge, huge web, you know, and it was just this gigantic... And I had to look at it every day. And the web just kept getting bigger and bigger and full of all these dead things. And I just got sick of it. You know, I didn't want to look at this. So one day I just grabbed a broom and went out there and I killed it. And, you know, Neil came home and saw, when he saw that it was gone he just, he lost it. How was I supposed to know? I didn't know that he was watching it, that it was this... That it meant something. I just didn't know. - You shouldn't kill spiders. - Yeah. - Where are you going?
