The reel got stuck. Come and check. How about playing a movie instead of a wedding video? Forget the movie. I want to see the wedding video. Son, just check what's wrong with it. What is wrong with you? Why are you say? When I go to lift Rupi's veil, the tape got stuck. When I went to the fields, it started raining. When I sit to study, we face a power cut When I tried to copy in the exam, the teacher caught me. One bad omen after another. Raja? Listen to me, Raja. Jassa? Jassa? What are you doing here at this hour? Keep it down. - I want to make a phone call. - What happened? It's urgent. Our phone is not working. Come with me. Lovers have a tough life. I'm in a fix. Fine. Hello, Rupi? You've called early today. You've called early today. Can we meet early in the morning? Can we meet early in the morning? I am feeling restless. What happened? I need so discuss something very important. Fine, let's meet. Okay. Bye. See you. Bye. Hello, Aunty. See you. He doesn't call from his house because he'll have to pay the bill. Their phone isn't working. Like hell their phone isn't working. I think this boy is up to no good. He has gotten into bad company. It's is just an excuse that his phone is not working. Be careful of him. It's not so. Don't worry. He has taken after his mother. He will ruin his family. Stay away from him. Fine, I won't. Go to sleep now. "We have just started seeing each other. "Not everyone is in on the secret." Son, eat something before you leave. Rupi? Where are you going? Computer class. Without your books? Great. You didn't notice that I haven't have anything to eat. I will first eat, then take my books and then leave. I don't love the computer class so much that I will go there hungry. Mummy, tie my turban. Coming, son. Hurry up. Coming. Let's go. "You are the only one who looks good standing next to me." "It makes everyone jealous." "Our pair is going to paint the town red." "I love her attitude and she loves me for it." "I love her attitude and she loves me for it." "I love her attitude and she loves me for it." "Her veils are getting brighter." "It difficult to hide when she always has a shy smile on her face." "Her veils are getting brighter." "It difficult to hide when she always has a shy smile on her face." "She cannot sleep." "I love her attitude and she loves me for it." "I love her attitude and she loves me for it." "I spend a lot of time in front of the mirror." "I make sure to keep my image intact." Kiddo? "I spend a lot of time in front of the mirror." "I make sure to keep my image intact." "We are young and bright." Give me two ice creams. - "I love her attitude" - Here brother, - "and she loves me for it." - enjoy. "I love her attitude and she loves me for it." Would you like a Samosa? Why would she eat Samosas with us? She stays sated by just talking to Raja. I thought you'd fight with them. No, you did the right thing by not fighting. you did the right thing by not fighting. - They were two of them, but I... - What do I say? - They were two of them, but I... - What do I say? I don't feel like fighting with anyone from the time you have come into my life What do I fight for, when God has alread given me you, the best possible thing. All enmities are over now. You know Sholay used to be my favourite movie. I swear I never watched it again after I fell in love with you. I used to be a fan of action hero Guggu Gill. But now I even like Satish Kaul. I have fallen in love with this world. I see it's hot, I see the birds, so I keep water for the I see it's hot, I see the birds, so I keep water for the I fear that they might die of heat strocreation of God after all I fear that they might die of heat strok They too are a creation of God after all Earlier I used to kill birds and devour them. There is nothing better than partridges. I have turned into a poet for you. Would you like to hear a couplet? You are in the wind. You are in the atmosphere. You are in the city. - You are in the village. - Stop it. Who are you? Shiv Kumar? I'll die if you keep saying such nice things. Then who will you marry? I won't stay alive if you die, stupid. I'll die for you. They look so good together. Raja is handsome. May they always be together. They should keep courting. They shouldn't get married for another year or two. Right. You won't get to eat for free then. When you will get married and come to my village, I'll play the song, "Cover your head with a veil for you have entered your in-law's village." I too have thought of a song. Which one? When I will leave my house, I'll ask them to play the song, "Let me stay another day, Mother." "Let me stay as daddy's little girl one more day, Mother." No, no, no. Don't ask them to play this song. If your mother agrees, I'll have to stay without you for another day. You should ask them to play this song instead, "Father, I have left all your dolls at your place." It's my dolls nor your dolls. Doesn't matter, they will stay with the father, right? My father is a very nice man. He has taken good care of me. I can never repay his favour. He still says, "I'll give you TV, fridge washing machine when you get married." I said, "I am fine with all that, Father "But I also want a bed with speakers installed in it." I really love them. A bed with speakers installed in it which plays romantic songs. Right. But when are we getting married? I can convince my father in five minutes You should talk to your family. I'll try to talk to my mother today. Shall we leave? We are done with the Samosas. Don't bother paying it. I'll settle the bill. Fine, we won't, if you insist. They won't pay anyway. It's okay. They are my sisters-in-law after all. They will soon insist I cut the ribbon. For long will we have to go back to my village in a bus? When will I sit on your bullet and go to my in-laws' house? It will be quite far in the bullet. Let's take the nature trail instead? It will be closer. How about walking toward it a little? "Cover your head with a veil for you have entered your in-law's village." "Cover your head with a veil..." Coming, Deepi. Lost your way to your house, girl? I actually did. Bye, Aunty. - Have some tea. - No, thank you, Aunty. "Cover your head with a veil for you have entered your in-law's village." What has you two distracted? What has you distracted, sir? - What do you mean? - I mean keep an eye on your son. Otherwise people will say, "we pay fees to a person who couldn't even keep his son under control You seems to love staying at your in-law You have come here after a long time. You don't miss us anymore. Who is ever happy to leave their parents' house? Who is ever happy to leave their parents' house? I don't speak up out of fear of disclosing our I don't speak up out of fear of disclosing our family matters. What is wrong? The one my parents chose for me hits me. He drinks more alcohol than water. I am in a bad state. Really? The ones our parents choose for us is like a closed packet. What is inside it depends on your fate. Everything depends on fate. There are only a few who know what they will get inside the packet. Really? Who knows? It is better to speak up, sister, before someone else ruins it for you. There are many who love to do that. I suggest that you should inform your parents if you like a boy, even if you get thrashed for it, cause that is better than getting thrash without them knowing about the boy. You are right. But a girl can tell her parents to get her married, but she cannot tell them to get her married to a particular boy. Hmm, whether you ask me for it or not, but I will be the one to get him to cut the ribbon at your wedding. Fine, you can do it. "I want to get married, but my mother wouldn't agree." "I want to get married, but my mother wouldn't agree." Mother, what do you think made the girl sing such a song? Was she getting old? Or Mother, it is also possible that her mother wasn't paying attention to he Or there might be some other reason behind it. Times are bad. It is possible that she is too eager to get married. Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible that her parents cannot collect enough dowry, and they asked her to wait another year or so? Or it is possible that she wants to marry a boy of her own choice, and her mother doesn't agree with that? Then her mother shouldn't agree at all. I feel angry on her mother as well. Why didn't she thrash her after hearing her say such things? She wants to marry the boy of her own choice. Don't you dare even discuss such a song. - No, I was just-- - Keep quiet. "I want to get married, but my father wouldn't agree." I want to get married, but my father wouldn't agree." "But my father wouldn't agree." I thought it was the mother who wouldn't agree, right? Mothers always agree. It's the father who is stubborn. I think teacher's son has strayed. What has you two distracted? What has you distracted, sir? What do you mean? You are paying attention over there. How about paying attention on us as well Our parents pay the fees through their nose. He is already heading towards his doom. Chanan, you don't know the answers to even a single question I ask. But you can gossip like there is no tomorrow. Everyone, learn this by heart. I want everyone to repeat it. The boy or the thrashing? The boy! The boy! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Stop it now. Father... Mother, do you have pinkeye? No. I had eyes for 50 years, but this is the first them I have opened them. I am shocked to learn that something like this can happen in this world. - What happened? - You know Jaggars? The ones who stay at the turning, near the sacred fig? - Yes. - Their daughter eloped with a boy. She was in love with him. Don't her parents love count? It's not the world but an useless child who defeats you. One should thrash such a daughter. Why thrash her? If you are someone who has the courage, then you should take your sword, behead her, and then chop her into small pieces. And then throw her into the river. Right, Rupi? Right. It is right. "White cotton..." This isn't cotton, son. This is silk-cotton. Oh. What do I say, Dad? Education doesn't let kids stay attached to their land and their parents Why? What happened? What else? A boy from my college fell in love with a girl. The boy asked his parents. - Okay. - His father didn't agree. The girl and the boy eloped. Really? Now the girl's family came and broke the leg of the father of the boy. They have agreed now. They also went on a honeymoon. But the father's leg is still broken. Shame on such a father. If he had been courageous, then he would have broken his son's leg too. Listen, you too stop loitering around. Okay. I come from a decent family. - That is true. - Listen? Coming. Action movies will be the end of me. There aren't many like us who would stand under the scorching sun for free ice cream. It's not like we have never had ice crea - Hmm. - Do you have the one with extra cream i So what if you couldn't speak to them? I will convince my father in five minute It's been two days. You still haven't convinced him. I didn't get the time. Once I start talking, I'll convince him in five minutes. May God be with you. I trust you. - I know you will convince him, Shiv Kum - Hmm. But what if my parents don't agree? My father has been educating students from your village all his life. Why wouldn't they agree? That is true. As his student when I had told my parent that Teacher has asked for buttermilk, my parents had also sent tea for him. So they will surely send their daughter to his house. I will inherit 15 acres of land. I am going to join the police force. They will instead ask matchmaker why didn't he bring the boy along, because they want to send their daughter with him right away. My father wouldn't send me away just like that. He has big plans for my wedding. My neigbours are more eager about it than my father. They are relatives, but they are drunkards. They will make every guest get drunk. We won't go to their house. We won't go there. Cancel. The house opposite ours. They had helped us fight our property case. We will surely visit them. We surely will have to. And the second house in our lane, they stood against us during the council election. We won't go there. We won't go there. Cancel. There is a house close to the Gurudwara. Their car had gone to fetch my father when he was deported from Qatar. We'll have to go there. I'll go wherever you'll ask me to. We won't go where you don't ask me to. There are good and bad families in our village as well. But you have the freedom to be nice to whoever you want to. Everyone in the village seems like a friend from the time I met you. There is a house at the turning our lane We will go to their house for lunch. I had stopped talking to my parents when I wanted to buy the bullet. I ate at their house for three days. We will have to go there. It is the right thing to do. And the ones from where I usually call you from. We are related, but my mother and the old lady there don't get along. They are enemies. But I am friends with her son. He is your brother-in-law. You will have to cover your head. I will have to cover my head. Right. There is an old council chief, he is the one who got my father transferred to your village. We will be nice to him. We will have to. Yes. How about cancelling someone. There is no one we can cancel. From the time I met you, I get along with even my enemies. I swear. Why are you talking about this, Shiv Kumar? Paro, people ask many questions while renting a house. We are going to transfer our lives to each other. Shall we leave? Or I will be late. Five minutes? Like the teacher? Hmm? Let's go. I am done eating. - Shall we? - Let's go. - How much do I owe you, brother? - Let's go. Settle my bill as well. 10 bucks. - Let's go. - Let's go. Here you go. See you. Won't you take two steps towards your in-law's village today? No, now I will go there in our wedding car. My son is back. How many new dresses do you have, Mom? You wear a new one every day. What do I do, son? I have a trunk full of new dresses. I don't get a reason to dress up, so I thought I better wear them before they get spoilt. Don't worry, Mom. You'll soon have a reason to dress up. How are you, Dad? I am good. Didn't you notice any difference in me? No. I have stopped loitering around. Okay. You look fine. Dad, I don't want to loiter around anymore. I want to join the police force. Then it will go straight to duty from home, and come back straight home after duty. Well done. This is what I had expected from you. Very good. Dad? Yes? - The village where you taught for 12 ye - Yes? You have a good relationship with that village. Hmm. I want to make that relationship better. Do you want to bring the kids from that village here for tuitions? No, not kids. I just want a girl from that village to be your daughter-in-law. Whose daughter is she? Nichhattar Singh's daughter, Rupinder Kaur, Rupi. The one who loses the council elections every year. I see. The one who got deported? Yes, right. I know him quite well. No problem. She is a very nice girl. Don't worry. I'll talk to him. You agreed so easily! I feel scared. What if you two elope tomorrow? Then you two patch-up with your families I will be the one left with a broken leg, right? I'll talk to him whenever you want. What do you mean by whenever I want? - He seems to be very eager. - Yes. Shall we go right away? Let's talk to the matchmaker then. Let's go. Which college did you do your graduation from, son? Khalsa college... I see. Which year? - 1996. - Very good. Graduation from Khalsa college - is a very good thing. - Hello, Uncle. - Hello, Aunty. - Hello, son. How are you? Cheating. It's almost final. What do you mean? Don't bother. You do what you came here for? Your phone is still not working? I have filed a complaint 50 times alread I had told you to tell him. Why don't you make her to talk to me some day? She is your sister-in-law. I'll ask her to seek your blessings. I want to sit on her lap. Have some shame. You will be her elder brother-in-law. - Why should I feel ashamed? - Wait, it got connected. Hello? You should stop collecting cow dung and making dung cakes. You will soon have henna on your hands. Really? Yes. Yes, I have sent the people over. They will reach by tomorrow or day after Just make sure you don't send them back empty handed. I want them to return with sweets. Someone's listening in? Yes. Just make sure those people come back safe and sound. Fine. Don't worry. I'll take good care of them. Okay. - Yes! - Okay, okay. Bye, Aunty. Bye, Uncle. Bye. Okay. Did you hear him? You shouldn't let him call from our hous He is selling drugs in sweets. I think he is a smuggler. He isn't a smuggler. He came to call his sister. Right, he came to call his sister. I hope you don't share family secrets with him. Their family has a bad habit of eyeing something that belongs to others. Do you think I am mad, Mom? He is my friend. But it is not necessary that we share everything. Don't worry. Fine. Teacher, you have taught in the village for so many years. Why don't you talk to him directly? Why do you need to involve a matchmaker? Uncle, marriages give employment to many people. We don't want you to miss out on your commission. Don't you want a ring? You have guessed what was in my heart, son. Now watch your uncle work his miracle. I'll talk to him in such a way that they will ask me why didn't I bring the boy with me? - That's it. - That's it, Bhola Singh. You are experienced. You just need to say that I always wanted her to be my daughter. - Okay. - She is a very smart girl. She used to be the class monitor. She was good in studies and sports. She used to be the life of the cultural shows as well. Teacher, if I could you always say such nice things, then I would have been a teacher and you would have been a matchmaker. Bye, Teacher. I'll get going. It's time for my bus. Okay. Get going. Where are you going, Daddy? I'm going out for work. I too want to go with you. I am not going to attend a fair that I'll take you with me. - No, Daddy, I don't like it without you - You wait here. - I'll get chocolates for you. - Come here, son. Come, I'll take you for a ride. I don't want to go for a ride. I'll get chocolates for you. - No, Daddy. - Listen, son? What? Your father is going to get my marriage fixed. Please let him go. He should take me with him. It's not like I'll keep her for myself. No, son. I am getting late and it's going to rain. Let me go. I'll get you whatever you wan No Daddy, I don't like it without you. You have spoilt him. Can't you take care of him? - It's all my fault, huh? - Daddy. You can go tomorrow. It's not like Teacher will get the boy married today itself. Son, listen to me, I'll get you whatever you want. - No, Daddy. - Please agree. Don't make my son cry. Please... Raja, nephew, would you mind if I go tomorrow? He seems to have settled down. Come here, son. No, he won't settle down. - Hello. - Hello. Please come. I hope you didn't have any difficulty in finding the house. No, he sent me here with all the details Come, have a seat. - "Listen girl, your groom..." - He is here? Raja's matchmaker is here. We had spoken to him about Rupi. - Okay. - Okay. Go get some tea and snacks. Which village did you say he is from? The one neigbouring yours. Okay. How much land...? I mean what about his family? They are landlords. The boy will inherit 15 acres of land. He is planning to join the police force. He is their only son. There is no flaw in the boy. Their daughter is already married. There are three people living in the house. Your daughter will lead a luxurious life The boy's father is a good farmer. Here's his photo. He graduated at the top of his class. Can I have a word with you? - I'll be right back. - Okay. What did he say? The matchmaker said the boy graduated at the top of his class. Lair. Should I talk to our girl? No. No need. Daughters' opinions don't matter. What is the harm? She is worried that we'd married her to a drunkard. Fine. As you wish. Show her his photo as well. Fine. Scheme worked. We'll get going. Look dear, all parents try their best to keep their children away from harm's way There is a wedding proposal from the Bhavwala village. The boy graduated at the top of his clas He is going to join the police force. He will inherit 15 acres of land. Look, they have send his photo. Tell me. No, Mom. Why do I need to look at his photo when you like the boy? I'll say yes if you say yes. Really? God bless you, my child. Be happy. I'll go and tell your father. Okay? Hello? Hello? Who is it? Greetings, Brother. Greetings. Can I talk to Raja? I would have called him but we don't have anyone at home right now. Okay. Can you give him a message that the note is ready, he can come and tear it. Okay. I'll pass the message. Okay. Bye, Brother. Bye. It's tasty, isn't it? Yes, it is delicious. There comes your something. - Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Why something? He is everything now. There they are. We'll get going. - Hello. - Hi. Come. Someone's very happy today. Like you don't know the reason. It's time to play the song, "Cover your head with a veil..." Have some sweet. Did you speak to your parents? Speak to them? Our alliance is fixed. Our alliance is fixed? Did the matchmaker make it? Yes. But he didn't tell me. He didn't? He must be wanting a heavy ring. But he met me last evening. Don't you trust me? A matchmaker came from your village. The boy is going to join the police forc He has 15 acres of land. Mom asked me and I said yes immediately. She said look at the photo, but I very cleverly said, "why do I need to look at it when you like the boy." Oh, my my. You are clever. You are quite clever as well. The lie you told to the matchmaker worke that the boy has graduated at the top of his class. Why would I say that? The boy from where I call you graduated at the top of his class. Really? They never stop talking. Wait a minute! He too has 15 acres of land. He too is going to join the police force What if he was his matchmaker? Yesterday he gave me your message with a smile. Oh no, I called him "brother" over the phone. You are worried about calling him brothe I am choking on this sweet. I should have seen the photo. What will we do now? What other option do we have? You should call off this alliance. I'll die if you get married and be my neighbour. He is your neighbour. You call it off. We don't get along with them. There will be bloodshed if I get it called off. Huh? What happened? Only the photo was wrong. Everything as right. Tell them that the mother was having an affair. She was planning to elope with someone else. Something is wrong. They got them married to his father. Okay. Whose mother eloped? His or yours? Have you lost your mind? Of course, I have! I am baffled. For the sake of our love, at least try. I'll first call off this alliance then give you my hands. What if it doesn't work out? - Deepi? - Hmm? Huh? Let's go. - Rupi? - Something is not right. Did you see Raja's face? - He looked like he had seen a ghost. - I don't know what is wrong. Rupi? Won't you walk towards your in-law's village today? I do. But now I don't know whether I'll be leading to your house or his. I'll try to lead towards yours. What do I do? What do I do? What "what do I do"? You will have to talk to them. What else will you do? How will you ever face him if you get married into his village? What if he kills himself? What if he calls me sister-in-law? I will die. Many lives are at stake. I will have to talk to them. You don't get a nice boy like Raja again He loves you a lot. The other one is a closed packet. What if he is a drunkard? Okay. Fine. Okay. Mother, I... What happened? Why are you crying? You know Mindo's granddaughter who stayed in your aunt's village? Yes. She ran away two days after she got betrothed. If she had to run away, she should have done it before the betrothal. Their whole family is in a fix. They thrashed her mother. They blamed her mother for everything. She deserves it. These women keep talking on the phone all day. They don't know what their daughters have been up to. I suggest they should break her mother's bones. Why just the mother? Her father is at fault as well. We should break his bones as well. Right, Rupi. Why don't you study? Go away. Hello? Hello, Rupi? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? We are victims of bad circumstances. What do we do now? What now? You already know the situation. What do you mean? You will marry him and come to my villag What other option do I have now? You are betraying me. You will walk in their house and I will be able to hear your anklets. I stop dressing up for you. I won't wear anklets. It's not about the anklets. Tomorrow you will say that you won't wear hair extensions. It's about your laughter. You will laugh over there and I will die over here. Everyone laughs sometimes. I'll laugh slowly. You don't get it. It doesn't matter whether you laugh loudly or not. You will still be laughing in their house, right? Some girl will laugh in your house as well, right? You too will get married to someone else Come on... We will be cordial with each other. You two brothers get along, right? I'll be cordial with the one you get married to. I am not going to get married to anyone else. You are getting married to him by mistak It is not your fault, Rupi. How can I hurt your feelings purposely? Right. You are right. I'll feed you for life, if you don't get married. I'll give you the same meal I'll give my husband. I'll in fact put an extra spoon full of clarified butter in your food. I'll never give you anything else. That would be unfair to him, right? We cannot do this. This is wrong. Let's make a small mistake instead of making many big mistakes. Let's run away. No, I cannot run away. Look Raja, my father is a man who has faced a lot of defeats. He kept losing the council elections. He got deported from Kuwait. He never won in gambling either. He will feel defeated by life if I run away. What is your father's name? Mr. Nachhattar Singh. So the one who wins after losing is known as Nachhattar Singh. Mr. Nachhattar... Singh. I'll get going. Rupi? Won't you take two steps towards your in-law's house today? I don't need to. I'll be going there in a car soon enough It will be forever this time. Anyway, I will at least think that God heard half our prayers, my village didn't become your in-law's village, but your village became my in-law's village. You cannot that our prayers were heard. We could rather say that our prayers fell on deaf ears. I'll get going. Your prayers were answered. God decided to ignore my prayers. I am feeling very sad about one thing. About what? I am heartbroken, but I cannot cry. Your heart didn't break as yet, Brother. It was just slightly bruised. The day it breaks, even peppy songs will make you cry. What do you want to do with it? I'll show it to him. What else? You want to ruin his marriage already? He is enjoying my misery. He says, "I'd like to meet her. I'd like to talk to her." He says, "I'll sit on her lap." I'll assure his mother that I am not a drug peddler. Wait, I'll be right back. Raja? I think you will come back with your legs broken. "Cover your head with a veil for you have entered your in-law's village." Jassa? Oh. What are you doing? I was just trying out poses for the wedding album with the headgear on. Good. It's not like you get married every day. Yes, I am so excited. What brings you here? No reason. Bye, Brother. - See you. - See you. Start preparing. Raja? Yes, Brother? Tell my sister-in-law that her elder brother-in-law too is engaged now. Congratulations. Daddy. I know you want to listen to songs. Let me watch the news first. I want to talk about something else. Tell me. We won't send them a wedding proposal. Why? What happened? That girl didn't match our standards. You are a famous Teacher and her father always lost the council elections He doesn't even get a single vote. Not even a single vote. Moreover, he got deported from Kuwait. - But you-- - You great person. He is no competition. We won't send a wedding proposal to those useless people. "My fate is bad." "How can I blame you?" "Should I forget you?" "Or should I lose consciousness?" "I am in pain." "My feelings are hurt." "Our journey ends here." "Yes, my heart stops." "Yes, I cannot breathe." "Yes, my heart stops." "Yes, I cannot breathe." "We made unconditional bets and risked our lives." "We were foolish to think that everything will work in our favour." "There is a void." "My life feels incomplete." "There is a void." "My life feels incomplete." "I cannot hide this pain." "Yes, my heart stops." "Yes, I cannot breathe." "Yes, my heart stops." "Yes, I cannot breathe." Gopi. Yes, Brother? Make me a mix tape of sad songs. Which songs do you want, Brother? Add - "Here's my dead body, walk on it if you want." Okay. And add - "Here's the blood from my heart to adorn your hands." And? Add the one about the pencil, raw pencil Okay. "God has written our fate with a raw pencil?" song? Yes, that one. Okay. Should I also add this one, "You will get infested by worms." "You will die because of a snake bite, you betrayed me." No, buddy. I don't want to curse her. Don't add any song that curses. Fine. Add a Hindi song. "You have punished me loving you." - Yes. - "A friend ruined a friend's happiness. How are you, Raja? I just came here to get a mix tape. I too wanted a mix tape. Gopi. - Yes, Brother? - Make me a mix tape of peppy songs. Don't forget to add - Cover your head with a veil for you have entered your in-law's village." Okay, Brother. Raja, my in-laws are here.

Yes, that's where my parents stay? I see. Aunty, I needed a small favour. No favours are ever small, dear.

If their mothers-in-law say anything about their parents then... - I'll be right back. - I cannot say anything about the other boy's mother, but Raja's mother is very nice. She will treat Deepu like a daughter. She is so beautiful-- Sister? - Yes? - Can I have a word with you? Coming, Sister. Excuse me. Please have some tea. Only fortunate ones get such proposals.

But you didn't tell us that the nice lady was married off to the boy's father in a hurry? - What do you mean? - I mean she was having an affair. She wanted to elope. She was forced to marry the Teacher. I don't know about that. What if it is a rumour? How can you come here if you don't know the facts? Don't you have any shame? How will the son be if the mother is like that? Hmm. We don't accept this alliance. Please leave. Let bygones be bygones. I won't let this out. Sister-in-law, you too shouldn't leave the house for a couple of days. Huh? The fact about the affair... The fact that you were having an affair with some? You wanted to run away. You were married off to the Teacher in a hurry. I am getting weird thoughts after hearing all these things. I thought you didn't seem the kind. You scoundrel! What do you think I am? Get out of here. You idiot! Get out of here. Where are you going? Where will I go? I am just going to collect my clothes from the tailor. Stop it. Stop buying more clothes. Oh God, I made a mistake by having a son Stop it. Don't drag me into this. This happened because of you. Someone ruined it. We cannot do anything but sit here now. Be strong. How much more will you cry, Sister? What can we do? We are not destined to have him in our life? You can be patient, Sister. You are as strong girl. I am not that strong. Oh God! The one who ruined this for us will get infested with worms. - She will get ruined. - No, no, no. Don't curse like that. What if it is true? What if his mother is really like that? Stop it, Mom.

I cannot ride with you anymore. - I am betrothed to someone else. - I see. What if I told him you were having an affair with me? Will you stay betrothed? No, you are not that kind of a boy. I know. You never know when people change nowadays. If you can change, why can't I? I didn't change. I was helpless. You aren't that helpless because you are not getting on my motorcycle. What helplessness forced you to get betrothed? Shush. Don't create a scene. I'll be right back. I pray that your bike's tire goes flat. Nice place. I didn't bring you here for sightseeing. You know who is a mother? Yes, she is another form of God. Then when did you see the other form of my mother? What form? Don't act naÃ¯ve. Don't behave like you don't know anythin No, I really don't know anything. Really? I had sent a wedding proposal for Deepi. Didn't you ruin it? You sent a wedding proposal for Deepi? Are you crazy? Well done, lover boy. Even witches spare the neighbourhood, you know? You sent a wedding proposal to my friend Why? You don't want your friend to get married? Of course, I do. I want her to have a grand wedding. Will she be able to find someone better than me? That's the problem. Right. You are the one who ruined it. Swear upon me. Yes, I did. You didn't just ruin the proposal you almost took my mother's life. What if I would have died instead? You have changed, Raja. You changed me. You taught me how to cancel things out in life. Now I will cancel everything out. I'll first cancel you out. I'll make sure I get married to someone in your village. I won't let you marry anyone from my village. I still have some right over you. I will give you the right. The right to ask me to cut the ribbon. You are not allowed to hide my sandals. I will make sure everyone in your village is at my service. I'll make a special request to the bride's family that each and every guest of mine will have a partridge. What is wrong with you, Raja? Such weddings are quite common. Girls helplessly accept their faith. Boys get addicted to alcohol. You should behave like a true lover. I thought you'd be trying to see my face in an liquor bottle. But you... Be Shiv Kumar and not Mirza. Don't vent your anger on a creature of God. My mother isn't a creature of God? You ruined her imagine in the village. I'll make sure she gets her respect back in your village. I'll get married to a girl from your village, and I'll make sure I get married before you do. Your father always kept losing, right? It's your turn now. Now that you are dragging my father into it, I will make sure we don't lose this time I'll see how you get married to any girl in my village. You think you can stop me? You want me to get married twice? Once before your marriage and once after your marriage? I had only ruined your mother's life so far. Now I will ruin your whole family. We will see. You do that. You! What is the matter? She has challenged me, that too publicly. I too said, now I will get married in your village. Why did you need to invite trouble? You are a handsome boy. You don't lack girls. That's not the case. Enough is enough now. This is not like a race. People compete about eating food. But don't compete in getting married. When you get appointed to the police force, just wait. If you get the job, we will find a working bride for you. You both will earn 50,000 rupees per month. If she comes here.... ...there will be a commotion. Change the method of taking revenge. I have told it once. Now I won't see profit or loss. Then listen. Go and take bath with 7-8 buckets of cold water. You will be fine. Go to hell. Bye. You don't listen to me. Go, you too leave me. Father, injustice had been done to us. I am filled with rage. I will take revenge by getting married to a girl from that village. No. I have decided not to get girls from that village into our village. I taught the children of that village, during extra hours. But this is how they value my hard work? They got me married to a dark skinned teacher. Am I so lowly? May they rot! They leveled false accusations on me. I am happy... that a girl from... that village is coming to those shameless people's house. Let bygones be bygones. Father, don't you know any other girl from that village? One who is very intelligent. Monitor of the class. The one who recites poems to entertain? Will you go or should I slap you? They are all worthless. But you have taught them. Don't spoil my mood. I am already tense. Father, I too am tense. Should I take it? - Keep it down. Go. Go. Tension, my foot. This is the house. Is it? Stop. What is the matter? - Why are you quiet? Challenge them. Let me see them touch you. - Shut up! Be quiet. If they find out... they won't let us do our work. - Really? The wounds are still fresh. This is a matter of love. We have to solve it with love. You shouldn't be scared in love. I am not scared. Once I become the son-in-law of the village... I will challenge them. Come. Why do you say you will be thrashed? Let's go. Look, is this fine? - Yes. Aunt, the fitting should be perfect. I don't like loose suit. Did I ever give you reason to complain? No. But I heard this time, you will get lots of order. Don't mix the clothes. Yes, dear. This time, I will get lots of order. Many girls are getting married. I am worried, how will I give gifts to all of them? You are too funny. Now all those who are engaged will get married. Yes, there are so many left. Who are left to get married? Nande's Rani, Jeete's Goga, and Minder's Sokha. Rano, Kato, Banno. Village-head's daughter. "You should smile a little." "You should share your sorrow." "You should smile a little." This village is dear to me. We can win the girls' hearts with humility. Come. Hello, sir. Hello. - Are you fine? Yes. - Hello. - All well? Everything is fine. Both the boys have settled down. Both the girls are married. I am enjoying life. Oh yes. What can we do about it? I didn't recognise you, son. We too didn't. We made a mistake. Aunt, your daughter must be of marriageable age. Yes. - Did you find a suitor? Not yet. We are in talks with a few. Okay. Aunt, look. Don't get her married to the teacher's son. Teacher's son? Yes. The one who brought marriage proposal for Dippi. But at the nick of time, we learnt his mother had eloped. I have heard a lot about him. People were even talking about his aunt. Really? Yes. Why should we care? People will say we are gossiping. Hello, aunt. May you rot! I am small kids. I will beat you up. Talk softly, sister. Come on. Don't touch anyone's feet now. God bless you, sister. He can also be my father-in-law. Let's touch his feet. Our work will be done. Maybe he is begging to get his daughter married. Don't make me emotional. Hello, sir. - Hello. Hello. - Hello. Is everything fine with your family? Don't ask about my family. I have to get 3 daughters married. Give him money, brother. Here. Where is your house? My house is in Bengal. I come here to beg. You should do some work. - Do some work. He lives in Bengal. Thief. Thief. He robbed me. - Drive fast. They robbed me. You robbed a beggar. May you rot! I will go follow them. Begumpur. Alight for Begumpur. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry. Let's go. Get on board. Come on. All on board quickly. Ma'am, move ahead. Is there anyone without ticket? Where is your ticket? Nobody should be without ticket. Yes. Check him. Take it. Where do you want to go? Yes, fine. Why don't you come here? You come here. This seat is vacant. Excuse me. Take your change. I am sorry. I didn't know what I say. I am nervous. Do you have medicine? What do you mean? - I saw you at the clinic. What's your ailment? I am a doctor. Oh. - Sir. You didn't pay the full amount. You give boon of life to others. You are people's last hope. Take this. Yes. I am also fine. I have a land and Bullet bike also. So? So. Did you study medicine in Hindi medium? Actually you said it, so I too said it. And we had a conversation. Ticket? Give me two. Who is the other passenger? One for me, and another for the doctor. She took ticket before boarding the bus. You too try your romance. Take this. Listen. This village is so beautiful. Everyone who comes here, wants to reside here. Take it. I hope nobody is without ticket. Come on. Do you have medicine for broken heart? No. I don't have such a medicine. But the way you are acting... if you break your bones, I will treat you. What do I say? She was very sweet. She talked sweetly too. I bought a ticket to get the work done. But someone bought her ticket before me. You can't get these girls from the bus. You know educated girls are so arrogant. They find flaws even in Hrithik Roshan. They say his name shouldn't be Roshan but Prince. I have another option left of illiterate. Option of illiterate? What do you mean? The girls in the village have dream... to get married when they grow up. They are the top. Are the fathers of such illiterate girls literate? No. But they beat badly. No. Nothing will happen. Oh! - Not for us. Not for us. My future wife is here. You should have watch it. She is neither my future wife nor mine... she is everyone's shared wife. The plug isn't working fine. Yes, it's unclogged. She is fine. Let's go. - No. Not her. Yes, it's done. It started. She is fine. - She? Yes, she is strong. I too know that. I think she is the one. I just want to marry, not love her. I don't want to do either of them. I will keep the bike running. You can come. "Where are you going alone?" Fertilizers. I am not here for that. You are very beautiful, so I am sure it will be good. I too have them. I have 15 acres of land. I have a Bullet bike. I will join the police. You will have a luxurious life. I have 35 acres of land, and the only daughter of my parents. And I am studying IELTS, so leave quickly. Then it's better. 35 plus 15 is 50. We will have 50 acres of land. We will rule. You stupid fool, I will whack you. - Forgive me, sir. When I first met Rupi... music was playing in the background. When our eyes were locked... the ambience turned romantic. What do you mean? I mean, we say all day that we won't drink booze. But in the evening, we drink when the atmosphere is such. Yes, it's all about the atmosphere... The way they atmosphere for war on borders. You too were born when the atmosphere was made. - Yes. I mean... your parents got married and you were born. It's all about the atmosphere. I got it, dear. Leave everything to me. Now the souls will talk. I will arrange for it. Yes. Cheers. - Promise? Cheers. I wonder which moron put these posters. Children, don't cry. What is the matter, sister? I wonder which lunatic put posters of ghosts. All the children are crying constantly. - Run. I have put posters in all the lanes. What did you do? I asked a boy to put the poster. I told him to talk of souls, but he may have thought ghosts. You still feel he may have misunderstood. When will you get wise? - I don't know. My brother, put romantic posters. Do you understand romantic? - Yes. From your vulgar gestures, it seems films like... Colourful Nights, Unceasing Rain... Queen of Night, A Young Sister-in-law... Lover-boy. Never mind. First let's go from this village. We will put posters of Something Happens in the heart. One more, The Groom will take the bride. First let's go, then you can get the bride. Come on. I will put it at 4 in the morning. Okay? "I know how to mend the broken heart." "I know how to repay the loan of sorrow." "I know how to mend the broken heart." "I know how to repay the loan of sorrow." "I will sing in your wedding." "I will fall in love before you." "I will get married to your friend." "I will get married to your friend." "I will take a girl from your village." "I will get married to your friend." "I won't count the stars, but uncork the bottle." "I will party hard with friends." "I will party hard with friends." "I will get wedding suit stitched." "I will make merry." "I will get married to your friend." "I will get married to your friend." "Blessed is the village." "My dear, you don't know my determination." "I will adorn my house." "I will dance till I drop." "I will get married to your friend." "I will get married to your friend." The ambience has changed in the village. Yes. I remember Bobby film. "May we two be locked in a room alone." Excuse me. - Yes. You should have held the suit you are wearing... and worn the suit you are holding. There would have been fire. Aren't you ashamed? - I am. But when I see you, something happens. Fool! They are mad. Take your suit. They have created a mess. What happened, aunt? Why are you so angry? It's difficult to walk on the street. The old men were telling me... you should have worn the red suit, there would have been fire. Stupid fool! One man said, something happens when I see you. Is this the age to fall in love? Aunt, there is no age to fall in love. Ladi, what happened to you? Fall in love. Love the world. Be like Shiv. Love the birds. Give them water. Don't eat them. Give them water. Fall in love. - Get out or I will slap you. Really, the atmosphere of the village had gotten worse. Hello. - Hello. Are the posters nice? Did you do this? Yes. In all the posters, there are Karishma, Kajol... and Anil Kapoor. It's all for you. You didn't have to do so much, silly! Huh? Rupi, stop chasing me. Didn't you see I belong to that plum Kajol? That plum Kajol is from my village. Now that you are here, you will be gifted with thrashings. Well you see... should I give you to the police or the village council? Make a choice. I knew what you could do. I will keep your letters in front of the village council. Grass is green. Sky is blue. My dear, Rupi loves you. Let's meet the village-head. We will call the whole village council. Then you can give me the gift. Shall we? Did you keep my letters... to reveal them to the village council? You never loved me, Raja. Of course. You wanted to take me to the police to give me gift. Have you made a bed of roses for me? Get aside. Honestly. And your complaint and village council? A family girl shouldn't meddle in it. What? What did you just say? Complaint and village council? What? Rupi, you made a mistake by tearing the letter. It was 90th. Only 89 are left. "You can't stop this official vehicle." Say loudly. Hail Goddess. Everyone says. Hail Goddess. I didn't hear it. Hail Goddess. Very good. Very good, girls. First of all, I thank all the girls for coming here. I have called all the girls... because there is someone... who is spoiling the atmosphere of our village. Someone is there... who wants to trap the girls in his sham of love. You tell me, our parents loved us so much. They buy us new suits on weddings. If a girl is dumb, they send her to tuition. And if a hunter... talks to us for 2 minutes... and giggles with us... and talks sweetly to us... then should we forget out father's love? No, we shouldn't. Yes, we should. No, Dippi. You shouldn't forget. But you had forgotten, Rupi. Dippi. If someone reforms her ways... we shouldn't point fingers at her. Nobody was there to guide me. But I don't want my sisters to suffer like me. That's why, you don't worry at all. I have talked to your parents. Tomorrow morning we will go in a truck, on a pilgrimage for 10 days. So that none of my sisters fall in love. A big round of applause. Look at our sister. Her parents fixed her wedding. Let's ask her. Are you happy? - I am very happy. Is our sister happy? - Very happy. Sister, are you happy? - A lot. Sister, are you happy? - A lot. "After working for a dozen years, I returned with a lesson." "We will marry the boy of our parent's choice." "We will marry the boy of our parent's choice." "We will marry the boy of our parent's choice." Very good. Thank you. Sister, sit down. - Yes. We won't do anything against our parent's wish. Yes. - Because... "We are birds." "We will fly away, father." "We are birds." "We will fly away, father." "We will soar high." "I wonder where we will go." "We are birds." "We will fly away, father." "We will soar high." "Someone's daughter is having an affair." "There is a commotion." Aunt, you didn't give me a treat on Rani's engagement. No, dear. Won't we inform you if we get her engaged? Okay, then a relative would have come. No. A cousin? - No. No? Then with whom was she on the Bullet Bike? Well, I don't care. None of our relative has Bullet Bike. Huh? - Yes. Then it's good she found a boy with Bullet Bike. She won't have to travel in the bus. No, dear. My daughter is very simple. Aunt, I saw her... sitting like this on the Bullet Bike. Posing like this. Huh? - Yes. Oh! Aunt, don't tell her that I have told you. We sisters shouldn't fall apart. It has happened with us. "We used to praise our children." "We called my daughters as God's boon." "We called my daughters as God's boon." "The entire family wanders around." Aunt, promise me, she shouldn't astray. "The entire family wanders around." "Why do I care, O dear?" "Gossips." Yes. Oh! Oh my God! "He comes in my dream." "He teases me." "Tell him mother is bringing bread." Should I knead puffed rice for my dear? - Do it. Shouldn't I thrash you? - Do it. I find the whole world sweet. It will be nice too. Where were you? To meet Rupi. - Has Rupi started riding motorcycle? And you were sitting on the motorcycle like this. No, mother. Someone is creating a rift between us. Do you think someone lied to me? Mother, I swear. - You stay with a smart girl like Rupi. You should learn from her. I will break your legs. I won't spare you. What is the matter? Don't cry. It's nothing. He told me let's eat snacks. After that he said let's eat ice cream. I said fine. But mother saw us while returning. And then she beat me black and blue. - Oh! I wonder who complained to her. But the one who complained will rot. No. Good girls don't talk like that. No. By the way, Raja is so unlucky. She broke that up too. Yes, her mother beat her badly. I don't know about the wedding but... we will be sinned for getting all the girls thrashed. Rupi too doesn't concede. Never mind. Turn that way. There are two new girls. I don't have it. Go and ask the village-head what to do. Yes. - It's all over there. Father. - Move on. Come on. - Father, that... Yes, dear. Who is it? Did you make him the village-head just to sit idle? You go and tell him. Oh my God! You have bandaged it nicely. Have I adorned it? No. There was no pain. Even a doctor can't bandage so well. Will I recover in a couple of days? Or else, admit me here. No. You don't need to get admitted. If you have doubt, get an X-ray done. By the way, I am giving you medicine. Take it. Only medicine. No shots? There is no need for the leg. But if you want, I can give you for your brains. Yes, bring two three injections for his brains. He has lost his mind. Hmm. Shall we go? - Yes. It's good I broke my leg. I got to see you. Or else, you have no treatment for a broken heart. Is your heart broken? - Yes. It was broken the other day... when someone else bought your ticket. There are many who want to buy ticket for me. It's no big deal. - You mean... you aren't going steady with anyone. No. I don't have any such intention. As for the ticket... I didn't have change that day. That's why I was quiet. Of course, you can't take tickets from just about anyone. Fees is 50 rupees. - 50? Oh yes. We paid that when we ate snacks. Never mind. We will take credit. We will pay day after tomorrow. Tomorrow or day after tomorrow. Don't forget to pay the fees. - Yes. We will pay the fees, or buy ticket for you. By the way, why did you come to this village? - Well... You see... We came to meet... - Yes. His aunt. - His aunt. Sanjh. - Yes, father? You are back, dear. Okay, fine. Treat them. You can carry on. I will go to the village. What happened? I don't know. Someone had put posters in the village. All the villagers are complaining to me... saying "What a village-head you are!" "You don't know who put the posters." I have to find them. If I catch them... I will break their legs. Okay. Give me a pill for increasing BP. - Pardon? I mean give me pills for anxiety. Will you take everything from this doctor? Let's go. - Okay. Goodbye. - The way you have got up... you will be fine soon. Oh no. - Yes, he will be. That's a girl. Educated. Nurse. Even her father was good. Her father was... If I get my way here... then our children will be doctors. - Fine. The day we take X-ray to her... I will talk to her. - Raja, not us... you. Did you hear her father? He said he will break our legs. I will go. Then go. Best of luck. Okay. Pammi. Who else is left? Last is Sanjh. "Gossip." How is the X-ray? It's fine. I feel, I should always be your patient. At least I will get to see you. Really? - I feel, I should always be your patient. You want to be my patient. Sister, how are you? How is the treatment going on? Hello. - Rupi. It's fine. Don't make the patient worse. No, it's nothing like that. I have given him the best of treatment. Really. Where is your mother? Inside. I will go and meet her. - Okay. Aunt. Aunt. Yes? Hello, aunt. - Hello. I wanted to talk to you. You can talk later, first sit here. Wait. Here. Eat sweet dumpling. Why? We fixed Sanjh's alliance. With whom? With village-head of the Begumpur. Village-head of Begumpur? - Yes, take more. Oh! I am very happy. First you eat. It's a very good family. Really? - I will go and give it to everyone. Oh my, my! She is so silly. How can you get engaged? I mean, if you don't intend to... or have any such desire? Don't you want to work more? You should say you love someone else. How can I say so? Nobody has bought ticket for me. I will... - Congratulations. I am very happy, sister. Really. You too take it. Her engagement sweets. Sister, you didn't tell me you got engaged. Now only girls under 18 years are left in the village. At least, eat sweet dumpling. Let it be. You give it to him. I don't think he likes me. I will distribute it in the whole village. Rupi is so silly! Yes, dear. What do you want to say? I like your daughter. - You! Your daughter too likes me. Ask her. Sanjh. Sanjh. Yes? Yes, father. He says you like him. Me? Yes. Do you? She is a girl. She can't say it on her own. I am asking you, do you like her? Yes, father. Yes, she does. But dear, you should have told me the other day. We wouldn't have fixed your alliance. That day, you didn't even ask me. What could I have done? Look, dear. You are an educated and intelligent girl. You can take your own decision. But dear, I am the village-head. How can I refuse them? Why didn't you tell me that day? Never mind. I will call them. Hmm? So boy... Yes? - Are you ready to get married now? No. Not for at least 2 years. No? No, I am ready. But my father won't agree. Who is your father? Teacher Baldev Singh. He was a teacher here. Are you Baldev's son? Yes. He is my childhood friend. We should to spend lots of time together. Listen. Bring sweet dumplings. Yes. - Give sweets to the boy. Sit down, son. I will be back. - Mother. Come and sit. Is it necessary to break it? She was the last girl, and you got lucky with her. Not the last... - Hello, sir. Hello, sir. - Hello, son. Eat sweet dumplings of engagement. Sweet dumplings. - Congratulations to you. You are invited with your family. Yes, I will come. - I will distribute... sweet dumplings to the whole village. Take sweet dumplings. Eat sweet dumplings. It's for engagement. Maybe you don't like it. Never mind. I will send it to your house. Rupi. Where are you going? I was going to... I know everything. Stop it. You have fixed your wedding. Let him also settle down. What enmity you have with him? Yes. We too have had patience. You too do it. You have created problems for us... now you too will suffer. What is the matter? - Nothing. Nothing, aunt. - Okay. Let's go. - Yes. "I know how to mend the broken heart." "I know how to repay the loan of sorrow." "I know how to mend the broken heart." Yes? Which bed do you want? With mirror or with speaker? By the way, she is nice. Your arms are my bed. Your heart is the speaker. I will hear your heartbeats. "I will get married to your friend." After the wedding, we can continue our work. Since you came in my life... I feel, I am love with you everyone. I love the entire universe. How is Rupi? She has a bad streak. Her father got deported. Lost the election. They say, even Rupi has lost. We will give her more time. We will have the first meal at her house. Okay. "It's my fate. How do I blame you?" "Should I forget you, or become oblivious to myself?" "The feelings are crushed." "My journey ends here." "Yes, the heart pains." "Yes, the breath stops." "Yes, the heart pains." "Yes, the breath stops." "This fate, your decision..." ".has created a rift between us." "I cry while laughing." "It has happened many times." "I could neither meet you with a smile..." ".nor forget you." "All the dreams have been shattered." "I am losing my patience." "Yes, the heart pains." "Yes, the breath stops." "Yes, the heart pains." "Yes, the breath stops." Hello. - Hello. How much money do we have to take? - 1500. Our sister is like a heroine. Our boy isn't less. He is a handsome hunk. - Exactly. There is nothing else to say. Should we get you married too? We will take 1500. - It's too much. You are quoting too high. - No. We will take 1500. - Listen. No matter what, you won't reduce the amount. Never mind, you tell us. How much do we have to give? Don't take less. - What are you saying? See if my legs are shivering. You can take it. Control yourself, boy. You can take as much money as you want. Find a pill in blue. I have taken the blood pressure medicine. Hmm. Take 11,000. - No 1500. She is here. Don't worry. Stand tall. Take 1500 only. - She is here. We can't let you go like this. First give 1500 rupees. My future wife looks beautiful. What is he saying? - You just ignore him. You stand firm. Don't worry. At least give him sweets to eat. How can we? First give us money. Never mind. - Then give it. We will give you 1500. Give it then. - Here. Then you will feed him sweets. Yes. Does it have poison? No. - He is joking. Feed us too. Where are the scissors? We have to cut the ribbon. Then cut the ribbon first. Cut it. "Your friend has come to the lane." "Please get aside, O girl." The one whom we wanted to show the wedding isn't seen. I think she is shocked by the ribbon cutting incident. Maybe she ran home because of you. - Don't be dejected. Oh. Click a photo with me. - No. It's hard to tell for whose happiness the person is eating. You keep throwing tantrums. You just click my photo. Make it passport size, and give me 6 copies of it. I will use it to fill forms. Okay, face too... Bring and feed me sweetmeats. She is here. Only this? Should I bring chutney? Bring whiskey. It should be sweet and bitter. Just like love. It's not whiskey but risky. We are in her village. Try to understand. It's our village. - It's not yet ours. You aren't yet married. You used to say, don't count your chickens. She can do anything. Then we will show her the farewell ceremony directly. - Yes. We won't give her permission to watch the ritual. Keep her away from my wedding. Go. Raja, I won't go. I am short tempered. I may say something harsh. Then you... - Say a few more for me also. Go. - Take the plate. I will take there. I will be back. Excuse me. If she starts to cry... then give two sweetmeats. Science says, sweets is good to pacify the heart. Okay, fine. I will give her sweets. Wait. What are you doing here? We have been invited with family. My mom is also here. Don't give me excuse of your mother. Forget your mom and go home. The groom doesn't like to eat or drink anything. He fears you may do something wrong. Go. What can I do? - You can do anything. Don't create a mess. You have nothing to do here. Okay? We will call you during the farewell ceremony. Uninvited guests! Go from here. Go on. Hurry up. Go. Hey! Hip, hip hurray! Don't touch the garland. Brother, she is calling you. She is calling you. Your future wife is calling you. - Let's go. She called you. Send her back. Take your souvenirs. You are mistaken that I came to stop your wedding. I beg of you. Don't bother me again. What happened? She gave you letter. It's your writing. Oh I see. I was a great writer once. Yes, Shakespeare. Tear it. If anyone finds out before the wedding... everyone will beat you. Tear all these. Why should we tear them? That's what she wants. That you should be emotional... and fall for her again. Tear these. If you don't want to tear them... I will go and call her. Take it back. You gave it to me on purpose. So that I get emotional, and call off the wedding. If I had to call off your wedding... I wouldn't have given you the letters... but to her. You just try it. I will break your skull. You have already done a lot. I am already furious with you. Very good. What did she say? She said... if I had to break your wedding... I would have given the letter to Sanjh. She won't let you get married. Rupi. What is the matter? What is it? - Read it. These are the letters, your future husband wrote to me. Why? You will know when you read it. Rupi. - Rupi. Be quiet, Rupi. Look, there was nothing from my side. My alliance shouldn't break. - Stop it, Rupi. We should inform before the wedding. If one finds out after the wedding, families break. If anyone else wants to save her, do it. This isn't Raja's writing. Someone else would have written it. Are you ready? Oh! Where is the kid? I wonder where he is. I was looking for him. - He is outside. What is it? What is it? - I don't know. Did you write it to Rupi? Me? No. She has told me everything. What she says doesn't matter. Fine. Give me a book. Here. Write something. Take it. I don't have a pen. - I have a pen. Here. No. Write it with your right hand. Let it be. The more you try to write differently... the more it matches. There is a lot in the world. Someone finds someone, while someone leaves someone. Everyone makes a mistake. She was my one mistake. Yes, I had made a few mistakes. It was my past. Do you know what past is? If the girl is married somewhere else... and the boy is married someone else. She will marry and come to your village. You will meet everyday. This is your future. Now I won't get married. Rupi. - Sanjh, listen to me. Sanjh, please listen. Sanjh. Wait. You never brought pen for exams. Today you were acting like a clerk. I thought I should help you, but I didn't... Daughter, what is the matter? You have come out. Is it cold? No, mom. I feel anxious. I am not feeling well. Can I get a chair? - Of course. Hey, girl. Bring a chair. Are you all right? Bring the chair. Do you want tea or something? Should I bring sweets or fritters for you? No. Mom. I am not in the mood to get married. Huh? - Not in the mood? Oh. I see. You are fearing leaving your maternal house. It happens. But you are still not married. You can do it during farewell ceremony. Mom, you don't understand me. I don't want to marry him. Huh? You don't want to marry him? Her father... I mean not that. - Please listen. Yes? Let go and see. Come. What is the matter, dear? Look what she is saying. - What is my darling daughter saying? She says she doesn't want to marry him. - Really? Okay, now I understood. You are fearing leaving your maternal house. Never mind. It's natural. Even your mother felt the same. People has to chase her. Do you in which they took her? I know, in the trolley. I know. - She too knows. But father... I am not going to marry. What are you saying? What is it? - Daughter. What are you doing? First you broke the alliance. Then now you want to call off the wedding... You are making it a habit. You had selected the boy. Didn't you? It's such a nice family. Look at the teacher. Village-head. What is she saying? Talk sense into her. The rituals didn't take place in the house. We have not even collected gifts. Oh. - Teacher, first you were after guarantor. Now you are after gifts. It's my principle. I keep every account clear. In life, Maths should be good. Father, you should see the time and occasion. You are talking about Maths... and here my chemistry is getting ruined. Daughter, didn't you select the boy? - Come here. She likes the boy. We can talk inside. Why are we disturbing the guests? Let them eat food. Father. Close the gate. - Why? All the guests will go after eating food. I have eaten. Let's talk. You ate. But the others didn't eat. - Sister, everyone ate. Don't get the gate closed. I feel claustrophobic. Sanjh, you said you love him. I lied that I love him. I wanted to break that alliance. I considered your lie to be true. I really love you. You too are lying. I really love you. Daughter, but I will lose face in front of all of them. And I have never lost. Look, Jatt. You didn't lose to me. But the one who doesn't lose to anyone... loses to his child, some day. You better be quiet, uncle. If I tell everyone, whose child has defeated whom... then the truth will be revealed. Please, let bygones be bygones. Then consider this also as a past. If this is the past... then village-head, you too have lost. - Oh dear! First call your daughter and ask her. It's all because of Rupi. He used to write letters to her. Rupi. Rupi. Call Rupi. Rupi. - Yes? What happened, father? - Rupi. Did he used to write letters to you? Huh? Why are you quiet? What have you done? You have broken my trust. I wanted to save your family. Not to save, but to break it. You have broken it. What is the matter? What happened? Brother, actually Rupi first loved him. Oh! Oh my God! Sorry, buddy. Please bring a chair for me. Girl, bring a chair. Yes. No, father. I am chaste. He used to write letters to me. But I didn't read any, I swear. Did you used to reply by guessing? You mean you used to call her from our house? You called me brother on the phone. No, buddy. I told him not to let him in our house. He has broken our alliance. Please give me a chair too. - I will get it. No, you will run away. Someone bring a chair for me also. Dad, I too want a chair. I will slap you. I didn't get a chair. You humiliate me everywhere. Listen, first everyone take a chair. Yes. - Give me chair also. - Give one to me. Bring it. - Bring chair for me also. If you liked each other... you should have told me. I would have got you married to him. I was scared, father. I thought, you have always lost all your life. You have put me in a dilemma. At the most, your mother would have reprimanded you. I wouldn't have eaten food for a couple of days. But we would have consented later. I didn't want you to be humiliated. Everyone would have been resolved in the house. Now the humiliation has reached all the neighbouring villages. A few have come from abroad also. Yes, I am from Canada. Look. It's an international humiliation. Petty things create a big fight. An Urdu poet has written so well. For a mistake of moments... I got punished for years. - Wonderful. Well said. - Sit down. Now that we are talking of petty issues... I didn't meet my uncle for years. When I met him... we hugged and kissed. Look at Jagir's daughter. If she has told her family... her family would have got her married to the boy of her choice. But she didn't say anything. She eloped. Her mother was furious. But now they have started meeting again lovingly. Even the girl is happy. She is happy, but she ruined all our lives. What did I do? - If you hadn't eloped... I wouldn't have got engaged... he wouldn't have got angry at me... and all this wouldn't have happened in the village. All the girls wouldn't have been beaten up. Son, you too take a chair. Yes. - Pinky. Yes? - You were good in Maths. Fine. Now it's your past. Forget it. What past, uncle? It's the future. She will come to my village. They will keep meeting. Even your Maths is good. Mother, I don't approve of this alliance. I can't get married. If nobody agrees, get her married to me. We will stay in our village. Should I slap you? - What? - Get me married? Dad, let me get married. I will slap you. I am sorry too. Sister-in-law. Sister. Letters. What had to happen has happened. What else can we do? It's the children's wishes. Have cold drink. Village-head, you have got the cold treatment. Son, get the cars. - Okay. Should we put flowers on our car? Let it be. Bhola. - Bye. Are you satisfied getting the wedding called off? You forced me. Even you won't get married. - Don't follow me, or I will shout. Tears in the eyes. You are crying so soon. You didn't even look back when you broke my heart. Because you couldn't bear to see tears in my eyes. Rupi, forgive me. I made a mistake. I misunderstood you. I am a boy. It's our habit. We misunderstand girls if they don't cry. Maybe that's why we can't cry. You should have cried in front of you. I would have happily attended your wedding. You have to understand the meaning of crying. I was crying for you... not for him. For whom are you crying today? For me or for him? Or for your parents? But I won't let you cry in vain. This is the last time you are crying. Promise. "Take veil on your head." "We have reached my village." "Take veil on your head." "We have reached my village." "Your anklets chime in my name."
