[light music] [dramatic orchestral music] [music continues] Woolwich Residential, how's that going? [man] We've got another issue to sort of look over. -Trenching. -In addition to the ones we found last week? [woman] The one we found last week is over here, it's over this line... -And what exactly is this gonna cost? -It's not all about the cost. We need to find the right solution-- Do we have access to the floor beneath? Fuck your trenching, fuck your cables, fuck your fire suppression, we have real problems. Five thousand square meters of this has just turned up in Jebel Ali. -That's not Rosso. -No, that's not Rosso, that's Bianco, but the owner specifically asked for Rosso Levanti. Now, the contractor wants to start laying this so he can get onto phase two of the payments. If he does that, the project manager's gonna tear it all up tomorrow. Why is this happening? This is the second time this thing's happened on your project. -That's just bad luck. -All right, all right. No, no. It's fine. It's fine. No, no. Aaron, it's fine. This is what we're gonna do. All right, guys, look at me. Hey, hey, hey. Talk to him, talk to Michael. It's his fuck-up. If he wants to get on a call later this week, we can all play friendly, all smooth it out. I'll help you on that. But we're not gonna bite anything that we don't need to when it was clearly Michael's fault. And this is a joke. I can do that. It's no problem with me. All right, so on this, if we have to trench, do we have access to the floor above it? [soft ambient music] [seagulls calling] [woman] Interesting. [laughs] I'm not, you are. -No. -No, you are. -No, you are. -That's-- -[people chattering] -[woman singing] [woman] Oh, Instagram. If they block that view from right there... That view should never be blocked. Ever. [kids chattering excitedly] [birds cawing] Come here. How far down do you think that is, in meters? Do you think you'd break bones if you jumped? -I would probably grow gills down there. -[sighs] Stop. [man] Okay. Yeah, uh-huh. No, it's not a big deal. No, no, no. What is it? Those documents should've been sent over already. Find the email. I can't not take calls. [woman] Yeah, you can. You're on a break. It's literally 20 minutes of your day. So, you can take a break. Right? [gentle music] You're just like a pain in the butt. -[laughs] -That's all you are. I think we might just have to run away together. [woman laughs] Come on, let's do it. Let's get it on. Don't you think? [soft ambient music] [soft ominous music] -[static buzzing and whirring] -[tense electronic music] -[static buzzing and whirring] -[tense electronic music] [quick somber synth music] -[upbeat dance music] -[people yelling happily] [people talking excitedly] -A wanker, yes. -Gina is a seven and a half. I am a nine. [man] You're not a nine. Not by any stretch of the imagination are you a nine. Oh, what's happening? Are we having a party? -Hello. I'm not! I never said I was. -You guys aren't American. Don't give me that voice. You're telling me you're American? -How's things with the lady? -They're good. Does she have any fit friends or anything? [woman] I'm from DC. Where you guys from? -Originally I'm from-- -He's actually from Sheffield. Wyoming was one place, Nebraska. -[woman] Wow, so Midwest. Okay. -Midwest. Yeah. -For you? -Yeah, for me. No, for me, maybe, but not for you. Bet she would for me. [man] I'd rehearse, and... -Let's go! -We're going to Chinatown. Where is he? Where is he? Have we lost him? [upbeat dance music] [door creaks open] [door clicks shut] [shoes clicking] [objects clattering] [jacket thuds] [man sighs] -[man] Hey. -[woman] Hey. -Have you been asleep long? -No, I don't think so. Have fun? -Yeah. -Good. -I'm gonna go do some work. -[groans] -I won't be long, okay? -[sighs] -Go back to sleep. -Okay. I'll be back in a bit. [sighs] [door clicks shut] [echoed sigh] [man] Swing by the Camden location, see how the men are doing in the yard. Don't forget to send that email. What about construction? Follow... [voice echoes] Did that meeting get pushed? It got pushed... On Kensington Two. Swing by the office... Residential building one... Camden locations... Tax... Swing by the... We need that done by October... No, I think we're going over budget on that project... Remember I'm meeting Claire today... -Claire, Claire, Claire... -[overlapping voices] Tomorrow. No, Thursday, Thursday... Claire, Claire, Claire... [overlapping voices] [breathes heavily] -Hey. -Hey. Take a look at Tangent. Yoshimoto's tearing it up again. -God, I would love to work with him. -[phone vibrates] Jeannie? Wait, what? Okay. [sighs] Okay. I can't talk right now. I'll... I'll call you shortly. [man] Hey boys, what're we looking at? [man 2] Morning. [clears throat] Hey. Yo, hey, hey, hey, hey. Good morning. Uh, I wanted us to talk about Yoshimoto today. I wanna do a collaboration with him. I wanna find out his availability, I wanna know if he's in London in the next six months. I think there's something we can do. -Done. -We'll sort that out. -[slow ominous music] -[speaking distantly] [sighs] [woman] Go. It'll help. -Her, yeah, sure. Not for me. -You don't know that. -Come on. -Maybe it will. -It won't. Trust me. -Babe, you get nothing back by staying here. -But if you go, then maybe you'll-- -There's nothing to mend! I do not need your advice on this! -Don't shout at me. -If I wanna get help... -Don't shout at me. -...from like an artist curator... ...about life, I'll let you know. [sighs deeply] I didn't mean that. I didn't mean it. This is something I have to do alone. [woman] It just sounds like she needs you, At least needs your support. [man] I know. I know. [plane engine roaring] [plane engine fades] [wind blows] -[birds chirping] -[insects buzzing] -[birds chirping] -[insects buzzing] [gravel crunches] [car engine shuts off] [birds chirping] [cows mooing] [birds chirping] [footsteps crunching] [wind chime rings quietly] [wood floor creaking] [sighs] What a shit hole. [wood floor creaks] [footsteps clicking] [bed creaks] [woman] Gettin' reacquainted? Hi, Billy. [wind blows gently] [thunder rumbles] Gettin' by all right over there? Yeah. What's it like? It's... busy. I work a lot. Sounds exciting. [thunder rumbles] You, uh... -You ever hear from Buck? -Nope. -Know where he's at? -No. Maybe Mayetta or down Dodge somewhere. Does he send you money or anything? -I'm really sorry. -Jesus, Will. What? So... [sighs] [woman sighs] When are we having the service? We already had it. [Jeannie sniffles] [birds chirping] What? -You've already had it? -That's right. -How? When? -Couple of days ago. Are you? I... I mean, I-I... S-- -So I came out here for no reason, then-- -I mean, what did you expect? -It took you nearly a week to get here. -I told you I had work, Jeannie. [scoffs] [sighs] Jeannie. Jeannie! [thunder rumbles distantly] God damn it. Jeannie. [thunder rumbles] [grass rustling] [crickets chirping] -[thunder rumbles] -[birds chirping] [sighs] Well, ask someone to forward you the email if you need it. [man speaks indistinctly over phone] Okay. I'll be back in a few days. We can resume normal service then. I can have a word with them and see. All right. Cheers. -Hey, baby. Sorry about that. -[woman] Everything okay? Yeah, it was just a quick work thing. It's sorted, though. [sighs] Good. Honestly, they can bloody well wait. So, she already had the funeral? Yep. If you can believe it. -I should have known. -Stop. You went for your sister and you're there for her, and I'm sure she's grateful. -I guess. -How's she doing? She's... She's Jeannie. [cattle mooing] [Jeannie] Bring 'em! Get that one, come on. Get. Come on. [cattle mooing] -Come on! -[man] You need to calm down. Everybody's working here. [Jeannie] Dusty, come on. Quit messing around, get 'em in. -Hurry up! -[Dusty] You think you can do a better job, then go do it. You're the one on the horse. Don't make me do everything. Get 'em out. -Come on! -[cattle mooing] -[gate clanks] -[sighs] Hey, thanks for your help, Sleeping Beauty. Are you hungry? Well, come on. I'll put together some breakfast. [Will] The boys are really good on those horses. Yeah, they should be. They spend enough time on 'em. We used to, uh, get 'em in with the rodeo. That still comes through here, huh? -Why, you wanna sign back up? -[scoffs] No, they haven't been coming around here for a couple of years. Ah, how'd that go over with Arch? Seeing as he was already dead, it went over just fine. He died, I don't know, maybe five years ago. -Really? -Yep. Heart attack. Kaylee up and sold the land shortly after. She moved the boys out east with some new Joe she took up with. BJ cut and run, too much overhead. He used to help us up around here, but it's just us now. Did you ever think about hiring someone that maybe could help with the handy work or... -something? -Don't be stupid. Of course I did. But with everything that needs fixing around here, the bill would run up from here to Cheyenne. Maybe you should sell. [scoffs lightly] Maybe you should have another cup of coffee. [Jeannie sighs] Uh, I wouldn't. It's Mom. I mean, well, at least some of her anyway. -What? -Her ashes. Yeah. Yeah, I-I can figure that bit out, Jeannie. What, what the... [sighs] What the fuck? [scoffs] What about the-the-the family plot, and-and the head? Did it not occur to you maybe to tell me about this when, oh, I don't know, when I asked where she was fucking buried? Hmm? Jesus fucking Christ. -Hey, watch your mouth! -Oh, come on. You just nonchalantly set that down as I'm trying to eat fucking breakfast, -and it just so happens to be the ashes of a woman that-- -[scoffs] I mean-I mean... I mean, what the hell did you expect? Oh, I expected you to react like this. -Oh, of course, yeah. -But I had hoped you'd react like a man. [sighs] Will you sit down? Please. [chair creaks] It's what she wanted, in her papers. So, what? [sighs] She wanted us to spread the ashes out over the homestead or something? You and me together? Is that what she wanted? No. She wanted some of herself back where she grew up. She asked for some of her ashes to be spread out by her family ranch. Okay. [clock ticking] -I'm not doing it, Jeannie. -Ugh. No. No. Kay can come out here or you can take the boys and go out there, whatever, but I'm not doing it. She wanted it. So what? She should've died out there instead. [scoffs] It'll take you a few days, a week's tops, to turn the whole thing around, and I'm sure that Kay would love to see you. That's great that you have this all figured for me, but I am not doing it. -Will you just listen to me instead of doing-- -Look, I came out here to help, and I tried to sort out all the funeral stuff, sort all the bullshit out, play my part-- -You're an asshole. -Sure. Yeah. -Play your part? -Mm-hmm. You know what? Just... [scoffs] Just go. Get outta my house. -[snickers] -I said, "Get outta my house." Get outta my house. [footsteps thudding] [door clicks open and shut] [birds chirping] [whispering] I can't fuckin' believe it. What the fuck? [grunts] Hey, boys. [birds chirping] Looked pretty good out on those horses, uh... out there. [Dusty] Gee, thanks. Means, uh, means a lot. Yeah. [gate squeaks] [breaths heavily] [birds chirping] [wind chimes clinking softly] [wind blows gently] [indistinct chatter] -[trees rustling] -[birds chirping] [keys jingle] [car engine turns over] -[Will] Hi. -[woman] Hey, babe. How are you? -I'm good. I'm good. -So, what's the latest? Well, I've gotta-- I'm trying to make tracks now, but something came up. I'll tell you about it later, okay? I'll call you. Everything okay? Everything's fine. Everything is fine. [bold triumphant orchestral music] [music continues] [sirens wailing] [announcer] Just a reminder, we are an all-volunteer fire department. -So any time you're calling... -["Stars and Stripes Forever" playing] -[kid 1] The go-karts! -[kid 2] The go-kart men! [female announcer] Thank you, ladies, for doing such a great job for us. Strong for over 150 years. Alrighty, there you go. [people cheer] [male announcer] The board invites everyone, and I mean everyone, to help celebrate our Independence Day by joining us at the 73rd anniversary of the Old West VRCA Rodeo tonight, at eight o'clock, followed by the fireworks display. [twangy bluegrass music] [female announcer] ...its riders, and especially the veterans. Let us never forget the great sacrifices these men and women have made for us. [male announcer] ...and preserve our Western way of life. [upbeat country music] -No candy? -[fair queen] No candy for you. What? What am I supposed to eat for lunch? [female announcer] A hundred years of knowledge, commitment and success and to celebrate the attendant anniversary as well. -[crowd cheers] -[rock music] [announcer] He's on the ground, he can hear you. If you like what he did, now'd be a good time to tell him thank you. [announcer 2] After the tie down roper has got back on his horse, and put some slack on his catch rope. -[commentary continues] -[whistle blows] His hand is holding that rigging. I think our pickup men threw the whole lot right there. They just saved that guy's life. Way to be head's up, boys. Way to be head's up. [distant chatter] -[horses whinnying] -[kids chattering] -[distant country music] -[announcer speaks muffled] -[upbeat country music] -[crowd chattering] [announcer] But the good thing is, the good thing is he got the horse roped. That's a plus. [upbeat music] -I could hit it. -You might have a chance, but I personally don't think you're gonna do it. -You ready? -All right. You gotta show me. Come on. -Aw, man. -All right, one more shot. One more. You really gonna do it? We gotta make some deals now because I don't think you're gonna make it, but you say you're gonna make it. -So what deal you got for me? -One more. Oh, man, I thought you gonna make it. What happened? I had a grandma make that shot. [classical Western music] -[gunshots blasting] -[men yelling] -[man] Yee-haw! -Right there, there's a Budweiser one. -Oh, that one? Right there. -Knock that one down, you get any choice of anything you want, okay? [Will] I get all these shots? [gunshots blasting] These things glued down? No, I'm done. I'm done. You're sure those aren't tied down? Glued down, anything? I promise you, they are not. Okay. [floor creaks] Oh, no. [exhales] [bed springs creaking] Oh, Christ. [sighs] No. No, no, no. Sorry. Service was patchy. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh... I went to a rodeo tonight. Yeah. Yeah. Wild times in the Old West. I guess. Look, I better get to bed. I've got a lot of driving to do tomorrow. Oh... Okay. Bye. [inhales] [sighs] [gentle inspired music] [music continues] [music continues] [crickets chirping] [gentle melancholic music] [crickets chirping] -[birds chirping] -[gentle music] [buffalo snorting] [buffalo grumbles] [music continues] -[wind blowing] -[gentle choral music] [music continues] [birds chirping] [choral music intensifies] [thunder rumbles softly] -[horse snorts] -Good baby. Good baby. [horse whinnies] [car rumbles] -Good girl. -[horse grumbles] [horse whinnies] -[birds chirp] -[leaves rustle softly] Food pass the test? Yeah. Yeah, it did. It was good. Good. More importantly, beer to your liking? [chuckles] Does the trick. So, how's life over the big blue sea? Everything you ever wanted. Ah, knock it off. It's good. Oh, no, you're gonna stay under my roof, you're gonna give me more than that. -What would you like to know? -Tell me about your job. Well, I'm still doing the architecture thing, working for a design firm. It's always busy. New jobs, new clients, things to do. Pays the bills. [woman] Well, you was always good when it came to fixing stuff. Suits you, I suppose. -Got yourself a girl? -Yeah. More or less, yeah. Well, which is it? And don't you hold out on me. I do. I do. It's more. It's more. Foreign gal? -She's British. -Ah, that don't count. You treatin' her right? More or less. [woman] You see the resemblance? You know, I won myself a bet. How's that? With Jeannie. I knew you'd do it. -You guys made a bet? -It wasn't no real bet. Yeah, Jeannie was all up in arms about the funeral, plus Buck reared his ugly head. So I just said, "Bet he does it." Calm her nerves. What was she talking to Buck about? -Buck things, I guess. -What was it for? -She didn't tell you? -No. Well, hell, Will, she didn't tell you, she didn't want to. -She didn't want to, I'm sure not gonna. -That's great. You two just have it all figured out, then, huh? Yes, we do. -[sighs] Now, about tomorrow. -No. She wanted those ashes spread on the southwest part of the plot. Used to like to ride there when she could. And I think I know the spot. Figured we ought to head out on horseback since that's how she'd liked doing it. -You remember how to ride? -We'll see. Do you remember how to ride? Yes. Good. Now, get some rest. [footsteps clicking] [sighs] [sighs] She's no fucking help anyhow. [sighs] -[footsteps clicking] -[birds chirping] -Got my horses ready? -[man] Yes, ma'am. Good. -Put that in my saddle bag. -Okay. -[horse snorting] -Hey. Don't wanna feel like I cheated Jeannie none. [horse sighs] Chico, are you ready? Okay, let's ride. [clicks tongue] [horse snorts] [gentle melancholic music] [music continues] Come on. [footsteps crunching] [woman sighs] [Will sighs] [wind howling] She never brought you up here, did she? No. [exhales] [woman sighs] She had a laugh... when she was younger. Brightest thing I ever heard. I know that ain't the woman that raised you. She ended up someone else. She loved you, Will. Not well, but she did. "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. He that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper. The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil. [voice fading] He shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and coming in from this time forward, and even forevermore." [voice fades out] [sighs] -[wind gusting] -[ashes sprinkling] No. No! No, no. [Will breathing heavily] Why don't you stay and have some supper? -It's been a long day. -I've been gone too long already, anyway. There's work, and there's things to do. I know it hasn't been easy for you. It's never easy laying someone to rest, no matter who they was to you. Don't think you're any different. Look, Aunt Kay, it's been nice to see you again, I mean that, but I'm done. I helped out Jeannie, and I dedicated even more of my time to that woman than she deserved-- Kid, I just don't get it. I don't. You don't? You cut her off yourself! Jesus fucking Christ! -[slaps] -[gasps] Yes, I did. But it never helped anyhow. Did it? [footsteps clicking] [crickets chirping] [rhythmic rock music] -[bartender] Hey. -Hi. -What'll it be? -Whiskey, neat. -[people chattering] -[country rock in background] I'll take another. [sighs] You got a secret admirer. -[people chattering] -[country rock in background] Seems you're responsible for this here drink. Is that so? Mm-hmm. Well, what can I say? You look like a man in need. I am. -What's your name, sweetheart? -Ruth. Ruth, huh? What about you, Mr. Whiskey? -Will. -Whiskey Will, huh? Yeah. I like that. Whiskey Will. Do you wanna know what I think, Ruth? I think this place is a barn full of rednecks and hicks, and that I wanna have my fun someplace else. Why don't you show me around town? -[muffled rock music] -[background chatter] -I'll take the bottle. -All right. [both moaning] Uh, I need a drink. [groans] Oh, yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Where are my manners? [giggles] Okay. Whoo-yee! -Whiskey Will rides again. -[Ruth breathing heavily] -Darling, did you know that I was a rodeo man? -[giggles] Whiskey Will was known as Big Buckle Billy. -Why'd they call you that? -Let me show you. -[giggles] -[growls] [footsteps clomping] Okay, oopsey-daisy. [exhales sharply] Stuck the landing. Ah, Big Buckle Billy was my name. Tie-down roping was my game. Ooh-wee! Yes, sir. Oh, yes! Mama loved to see me rope. For a while. [groans] [grunts] I was good too. But any cow tit could do it, right, Ma? Ah, no, no, no. Steer wrestling. Now that's a man's game. [grunts] But you gotta be fast. You gotta be good. Right, Ma? [grunts] Steers are strong. Get 'em by the hamstring. Ooh, you'll get a broken arm. [exhales] Walk it off. Concussion? My fault. Puncture wound! Doctor's just lying to you to make you feel better about being such a fuckin' loser. [grunts] Oh, Ma. Oh, yeah. Oh. [breathing heavily] [panting] [sighs] Oh, Ma. You never even fucking gave me a chance. [panting] -[exhales] -[Ruth] Hey. Mr. Big Buckle Billy. Are you gonna play little cowboy all night or are you gonna fuck me? [sighs] Darlin', I've had enough country puss in my time. You have yourself a great night. [footsteps clicking] [sighs] Fuck. Ruth, wait. Ruth. -Wait a second, God damn it. -[fence rattles] Hold on. [grunts] Ruth, wait. I just wanna say-- -[knee thuds] -[Will grunts] [Will grunts] -[car humming] -[wind whipping] [gravel crunching] -[horn honks] -[door ajar alarm beeping] [retching and coughing] Kay! -[car door closes] -[beeping stops] Kay! [groaning] [horn honks] Kay! [sighs] [groaning] [Kay] Will! Oh, Jesus. -[Will groans] -[Kay groans] Come on. Get up. Got you. I got you. Go ahead, put your weight on me. It's okay. [birds chirping] [thunder rumbles] [thunder rumbles] [rain patters] [thunder crackles] [wind howling] [birds chirping] [slow somber music] [horses snoring and whinnying] -[woman] Hey, hey. -[man] Hup. -Hup. -[woman] Hey, hey! [music continues] -I got it. I got it. Oh, whoa, whoa. -[whistling] Oh, no. Oh, shit. Eh! Eh! I'm gonna go for a walk. Sure you're up for it? Yeah. All right. You know best. [thunder rumbles] [crickets chirping] [footsteps approaching] I was wondering whether you were gonna come back. You've been gone a good long while. [Will] I was. [sighs] Anything going on out there? Grass behaving itself? Everything is ship shape. Made a pretty good stew if you want some. -No, thank you. -M'kay. You about ready to tell me what the hell happened the other night? [sighs deeply] I went to some shit bar... made off with some girl. Ended running my drunken mouth, and... And so she good and well kicked your ass. Oh, my. [chuckles] Oh, you fool. -It's cowgirl justice, I guess. -You betcha. But you've been on the end of that more than once before, huh? Yeah. Since the day I was born. What'd you think when your mother blew away with the wind? What? [sighs deeply] -I thought, "Good, it's done." -No, you didn't. You wanted to think that, but you didn't think it. -Not like that. -Whatever. I'm not stupid, kid. I... [sighs] Just forget it. I thought I should've loved her more. Maybe I let her go too easy. -That's not really fair. -You said it yourself. I cut her off. Yeah, but you... It was a fence post that did it. Must've been part of the original homestead because it looked old and cracked and unnatural. Almost like it wasn't supposed to be there but it was, part of the old outer fence. Sheep were in the valley. Last of the season. The air smelled cold, that good fall cold. Your granddaddy, he thought there was weather coming. He was right. It began to snow, soft at first, but it came quick. Herd started to scatter, and we gathered what we could, one group and then another, and the whole time, that white kept coming. Before long, we were lost. Daddy led us to a small copse, sat against a tree, and his eyes were fluttering. I could see something was wrong. I was crying. Started to yell to keep him awake. [sighs] I was so very scared. But your mother... [chuckles] she was quiet. No tears, nothin'. Just stood there like she was made outta glass. And she walked away, disappeared into that white veil, found that fence post, not 20 feet from those trees. Three of us crawled the wire back to the corral out of the storm. Found out later Daddy had a heart attack out there if you'll believe it. Your mother... never said nothin' about it. -I didn't know that. -Well, you wouldn't have. Your granddaddy was proud. It'd torn him up, people knowing. It bother you? Hearing what she did? Yes. Always something to someone, never a mother to you. Okay. Whatever you're looking to get back is gone. You don't like it? Fine. But you go anywhere you like, Will, she's going with you. [gentle haunting music] [music continues] [wind whipping] [car rumbles] [car engine accelerates] [car engine accelerates] [tires squeal] [window whirring] Hey. You doin' all right? You good? You need a lift, I can... There's not a lot out here. You're gonna be walking for a while. [sighs] Look, I... I-I know, I blew by you earlier. I shouldn't have done that. I should've stopped to see if you were cool. It's really hot out. Come on, just... Get in. I can drop you somewhere. [wind whipping] [car engine humming] [dump truck rumbling] [traffic whizzes] [machines rumbling] [bag clatters] So that's it, huh? It's not so bad. All right. So I'll see you later, then? [bag clatters] [keys clinking] [car rumbles] [brakes squeal lightly] [clears throat] [pot clinks] This is really good. Thank you. What are you doing here? Just visiting family. Grew up not far from here. I live someplace else now. Where's that? Well, you're here now. Why did you pick up my sister? I was just trying to be helpful. Mr. Helper. I'm not sure. [lamp squeaks lightly] Beautiful spot you guys have staked out here. You guys been here for a while? Yeah. A while. It is beautiful. [birds chirping] [knocking on metal] It's a pretty full house inside, but, uh... should keep you warm. [wind whipping lightly] [birds chirping] -[wood sawing in distance] -[sniffles] [groans] -[metallic thud] -[groans] [sighs] -So what I'm gonna have you do is move these over here. -[Will] Okay. You make me the pile, and I'll head over. -You want them on the same side? -Yeah. -That one'll have to be cut later. -Okay. [birds chirping] [leaves rustling] [dirt crunching] Can you go grab another one of those? Over at the ravine. [water splashing] [insects chirping] -You're pretty good with that saw. -[chuckles] I design buildings. Back in London. Oh, yeah? What's that like? [sighs] Expensive. Busy. It's people spending millions, squabbling over a few square meters. It's funny, really. You ever think about gettin' outta here? -Why? -Mm. Just to go somewhere, just to see it. No. No, this is home. [wind whipping] [footsteps crunching] [birds chirping] [hollow metal banging] [birds chirping] Your family? Brothers and sisters? -Yeah. Sister. -Huh. Is that who you're on your way to visit? -No. No. Been there already. -Well, that must've been nice... if you haven't been there in a while. My mother died. I came back to help. I guess I didn't know any better. You didn't like her, your mom? No. No, I didn't. Well, you're probably not the first one. The thing is... I stepped out. I stepped out on my girl. Stopped talking to my sister, my aunt, pretty much everyone. [sighs] Only to hate a dead woman. I hope my son doesn't hate me. I can't be with him right now. [birds chirping] Someday. I didn't...
