Thank you. Stel, you're a mess. / Don't clean it up. You're gross ! You wouldn’t dare! Coward! / No. You're so ugly! What are you doing? Biyan, what's that? Come here! Stel? What are you doing? Stella's also got boobs. what's that? Come here! Delete it! I'm gonna make ours even. Let me see. Mine are bigger. But I bet Kettie's boobs are bigger. She’s going to get pissed. Let's mix her drink ! My darling Kettie, please look up. What are you doing? Kettie's boobs are bigger than Biyan's. Take that! Stel... I... I wanna give up my virginity. You're tempted, aren't you? What have I been telling you? You wouldn't last very long. You're kidding, right? Who are you going to do it with ? Whoever's willing to pay the price. Now? Let's look here. What about that guy? I don't think so. You can tell that's the type of guy who's scared of his wife. He looks so scared, I bet he can't even get it up. What about that artist? He stinks! If you want to learn about taste, you can learn it from him. That's why he stinks. Because smell is a part of taste. I'm confused, are you looking for sex or for money? Money, of course. If money is what you're after, we're looking at the wrong guy. He's definitely poor. Guys! He's willing to pay me five. Five million? Tell him you want fifteen million. Isn't that a little too much? Settle for ten million, but make sure it's all in cash. Okay, I'll try. Well? Ten million, all right? Wait a minute. He's agreed to pay ten million. Cash? ATM transfer, but I don't have a bank account. Use mine. When?/ Now. / Now? Who's in there? How was it? Did you give him the right account number? / Yeah, why? I never got the money. No way. Have you checked it? You'd better check it now. I've checked. Ask Biyan. / Are you serious? Why would we joke about this? You guys are messing with me, aren't you? That's your money. All I had to do was check for you. Please check one more time. We already made a deal, right? So let's just find that guy and ask him to transfer the money to my other account. Are you serious? / Where's that guy? He's already left. What am I supposed to do? / You're crazy! I told you not to let him go before we got the money! What are we going to do now? / She's so careless! So I did it for nothing then To me, that's a lot of money. I could've bought myself a cellphone, a purse. / Wait a sec. What did you say? What do you wanna buy? / I wanted to buy a phone like yours. The kind with a camera. Alright, here. I'll lend you my money. You guys were messing with me! Friends, we’re holding hands. But our perspective are different. Friends, we’re all running But not in the same direction I’m a virgin I don’t regret this I’m a virgin I don’t care if people say I’m out-of-date For me virginity is important to hang on to And I’m sure God will give me the most beautiful place I still want to make friends although our worlds are different I choose my own way With pride, I’ll carry myself I’m a virgin I’ll hang on I’m a virgin. I don’t care if people say I’m out-of-date For me virginity is important to hang on to And I’m sure God will give me the most beautiful place Bitch ! Mr. Amin! Mr. Amin! Mr. Amin! Miss Biyan. If only that had been a bomb I'd thrown back there. I'm sure that would've felt liberating. Today, I feel like ground meat off a hamburger all chewed up by my father's putrid mouth. While Kettie's celebrated freedom reminds me of nothing but the obscene laughter and flirtatious smile. of the naughty lustful women my father dates without any feeling whatsoever. The sharp bursts of joyous laughter that cut like a knife through my mother's heart. leaving an open wound that'll never heal Mother, I love you. But I can't understand why you're still holding out in that house. Kettie, I love you. But I don't know whether to laugh or cry, in celebration of the loss of your virginity. To me, the loss of a girl's virginity would be the loss of her pride and dignity as a woman. But the thing that I just can't understand, is why I also enjoyed spending your money. Bajaj! / No, thanks. Stel..I'm on the way to school, i'm riding a cab. A cab? You usually take a bajaj. / Shut up! I'm still weak. I'm sure you can imagine that. Why did you go home so early last night? The party had just started. You suck! I'm sorry. I really didn't feel too good last night. Today's first period is Literature. You know that's my favorite class. I'll see you in school, okay? WANT TO BE A FAMOUS MOVIE STAR? Bajaj! / No, thanks. Good morning, darling. Morning, Stel darling. You got a new tattoo, right? We wanna see it! You must have another one, right? No, I don't. What're you guys doing? I've only got one. Trust me. You must have another one somewhere. Stop it. That's all you've got and you're already making such a big deal. Check mine out. It's just a stupid tattoo. What's so cool about it? Let’s go. Okay, the stage is now open. Release the space and time. Create an exhibition. Alright, Luna. This short story is inspired by someone. Marix. It was a bright and sunny Sunday sometime in December. For a number of time, I see his face. On a poster, in a theater at the mall. One day, sometime within the fourteen days of my visiting that very same spot. Bella, a friend who had noticed me under that poster, approached me and spoke to me. "Biyan, do you really like him or are you just foolish?". "Or is foolishness an element of love?". "I was shocked". Before I had the chance to even react, she had already spoken her mind. Luna! What is it, Biyan? "I wouldn't want to fall in love if that meant I had to be as dumb as you." Are you reading my short story? Klepto! "Bella's right." Luna, what the? Come here! Come with me! Bitch! I've been looking for both of you all over the place. And here you are. I'm sorry, for not skipping school with you. I feel really bad, guys. What was I supposed to do? / Yeah. We know that Literature is your favorite class. That's okay. Who knows, one day you could be a famous writer. And receive an Oscar. Not an Oscar, but a Nobel. Oh, com'n guys. Stop rubbing it in. What's that? / Something. Guys, think my clothes are okay? It looks nice, Stella. You look like an actress. / What do you think? It's good. My make up is a mess! It’s so overdone. No, it suits you. / What do you think? / It's nice. Tattoo! It's the tattoo that ruins my look! Why did I get this tattoo? Idiot..Idiot..Idiot! Are you sure my clothes look all right on me? / Yes! Can't you guys be serious? I should've worn that blue dress hanging in my closet./ ACTION ! What's wrong with you? Don't you know? I love you, Yul! What haven't I done for you? Yuli, please forgive me. C U T ! Kiss her, kiss her, kiss her! You both know this is a love scene. Squeeze her ass if you must. What's wrong with you? This is the eleventh take. It's not like you've never made love. Not like you've never kissed! But his breath stinks. Read this dialog. Me? I'm not here for the casting. I'm the one. Read this. The underlined part. Are you ready? Yes. When I say "Action," Start reading. Yes. Action./ Now ? / ACTION ! Don't you know that I love you with all my heart. I devoted all of my love to you. All and no less. I love you too. But what kind of feeling did you have for me? You flirted with other women. What are you doing with that lousy hooker, you bastard? You don't give a damn about my love, my loyalty and my sacrifice. Fact is, your sweet words and promises are just rubbish! You're good, But you still need a lot of practice. I'm sorry, but this role is just not right for you. Alright? It's alright. / Don't give up. Keep practicing. One day, you can get this role. Thank you. / Okay. What do you think? / They're pretty. But their acting just doesn't compare with yours./ Excuse me. Why don't you try it? Can I help you? / I’m still trying something. This you try. Please read that page. Where is it? Alright, read page 107. This is about two lovers who were separated by love. And now they meet again. Play it freely. I've missed you, darling. Each day without you feels like a week. A year feels like a decade. I feel the same way without you. Each and every second that passes by.. ... you're all I think about. Come on, play it. / You're there even in my dreams... And you're the object of all my fantasies. And mine, too. Go on. My darling. My love. How dare fate try to meddle, to interfere with my love for you. If you love with all your heart, nothing can come between us. Release your emotions. Go on. I can only hope..../ Go on. That one day, our love will be united. Forever. YEAH! IF YOU WERE NOT MEANT FOR ME What were you doing ? What took you so long?/ Where's Stella? I devoted all of my love to you. All and no less. I devoted all of my love to you. What's up? / Nothing. It's nothing. That director just gave me some advice. He told me that you had talent. All you needed was a bit of practice. He guaranteed, That you can get definitely get the role. Let's go. / Do you know? I love you with all of my heart. I devoted all of my love to you. All and no less. It's still not right. That dialog is meant to be one that involves love.. ... Blended with jealousy and agony. Are these your new sunglasses? These are so cool. Yeah, it is meant to be filled with anger. But keep in mind that all that anger is caused by the pain of a broken heart, so.. / How much did you get them for? So you need to make sure that anger isn't all you're showing. Because there are many types of anger. Are there any other models? / Can't you shut up? Why are you angry? Why are you snapping at me? All I did was ask how much they were and where you got them. Can't you see I'm trying to practice here? It's been so long that you've been so cynical towards me. You're worried that they're going to cast me for the part, aren't you? Why would I be? / You're jealous. / No, I'm not! I'm sorry, Stel, but I'm just a little pessimistic cus I just don't think you've got much talent for acting. What do you know about talent? / You can't force it if you don't have the skill. You don't know anything! Where are you? I need to get out of here. I just can't stand it in here. I'm going. Who invited her anyway? It's pointless to teach someone who's got no talent to begin with. You're just wasting your time. You bitch! Stop that ! Don't listen to her ! You know what she's like! How are you? What took you so long? I've got a headache. I've been waiting for you for three hours now./ I'm sorry. So is it on? / Yes, it is. Is it on? / Yes, it is. Where? / Upstairs. What room number? / 316. Is he old? / Don't think about that. Just think of the money. Don't you know that I love you with all my heart. I devoted all of my love to you. / It's not right. Feel it. Cry if you have to. I don’t know how to cry. Don't you know that I love you with all my heart. I devoted all of my love to you. What'd I tell you? I don't know how to cry. Maybe Kettie was right. I really don't have any talent. You have talent. You just need more practice. You really want this role, don’t you? You have to succeed. What if I fail? You cannot fail. You have to get what you want. Come on! / Where have you been? Why? / Let go of me! Where are you going? I'm sick of this! You bastard! Hi, Kettie. Get off ! Don't you know how I feel? You know how I feel, don't you? Of course you know how I feel. We have to meet up. Right now. / What's happened? I can't explain. We have to meet up. Yes we met / Please? You know my feelings, right? But. Of course you know how I feel. You know how I feel, don't you? / I can't leave right now. Can't leave right now? We'll meet up at school tomorrow. Okay, I get it. You know my feelings! Thousands, even millions of sperm are ready to fertilize the ovum. But it only takes a single sperm to start the process of fertilization. It will then develop into a fetus. Then, into a baby. Then finally, into a human being just like the rest of us. It's very clear that having a baby requires great responsibility. Who here has a boyfriend or a girlfriend? Who here has ever ... had sexual intercourse of any kind? Can you imagine what it would be like for someone your age, as young as you are... To get herself pregnant, then having to raise a child, take care of them and prove them with an education? There are some teenagers who have been kicked out of their homes and shunned by their own families. Can you imagine what that would be like? What about that child's future? Where are you? I'm here. Where is here? At school. What school? Your school. Where are you? I'm in the toilet. Please come here. Hurry up. I'll be right there. Serves you right, bitch! I need to pee, Ma'am. Me too. It's bad. My future's gonna get so screwed up. What's happened? Last night, I met up with a guy at a hotel. Good for you. You've got customers. I'm so confused. I couldn't sleep all night. What's wrong? Well, here's the problem.. I'm.. What is it? That guy... Oh, my God! What's happened? / He came inside of me! So, are you pregnant? I'm so scared. / Is that all? And I thought it was a real problem. Kettie.. All you have to do is take an abortion pill and then you jump. Next time, use protection. An abortion pill, then jump? How do I jump? Come on. Jump./ What kind of jump? Come on./ Maybe this way. Higher. Again. 1, 2, 3, 4. Jump! 1, 2, 3, 4. Jump! You suck! I'm scared. I'm really scared of getting pregnant. You know my Mom got pregnant out of wedlock. I know she suffered a lot. I don’t want to be like her. I don't want to end up like her. I'm so scared. I really can't understand what I'm feeling right now. I'm really sad over Kettie and all her problems. But I just can't hide my happiness over meeting Marix. It's as though suddenly, thousands of beautiful birds were flying right into my heart in a chorus so melodious. Marix, It sounded so beautiful when you read that script. I couldn't tell whether it was all just written dialog, Or the sound of true love from within your heart. I felt like a happy little bride-to-be.. ... When the director said that I was perfect for the role in that movie with you. But such happiness is unreal. My friend, Stella, wants that role so much. God, Why must my wings be so paralyzed all of a sudden.. ... That I can no longer fly? Come on. Hurry up. My stomach's hurting all of a sudden. One of the actresses isn't here yet. / She still hasn't arrived? SHIT ! SHIT ! SHIT ! If she keeps this up, my whole schedule's gonna get messed up! Do you know how many movies I've made? I've made twenty movies, and now I have to wait for a new comer? When she gets here, tell her to come to me. I want to spit at her face! I'm sorry, Luna's not here yet. / Good afternoon. I've met you before. I just came to ask for another chance for the role. There's no time for casting now. Give me another chance. / I don't have time! It won't take long. / I said I don't have time! I'm only asking for a minute of your time. / Look! Look! Look at that! Can't you see we're all busy now? Where are you going? There? / Yes, Sir. I've been practicing just as you asked. I've been practicing just as you asked. I think I'm ready for that role. Look, you're just making my headache worse. / I'm only asking for a minute. Where is your friend? She should've gotten this role. All she had to do was sign the contract, but she never showed up. Don't give me a headache! Do you mean Biyan? / Yes, she should've gotten the role. But instead, you come here. Stop making my headache worse! You won't regret choosing me for the role. I really have been practicing very hard. Empty the set. Get out. / Come on. / Don't do this! I've been practicing! Don't throw me out like this! Just give me one chance to show you! You have to see my acting first! Don't you know? I love you with all my heart. I devoted all of my love, gave you my heart. All and no less. But what did I get in return? You flirted with other women. What are you doing with that lousy hooker, anyway? You bastard! You don't give a damn about my love, My sacrifice and my loyalty. Your sweet words and promises are just rubbish! I like this! Shit ! Shit ! My stomach's hurting all of a sudden. You should act like this. You could definitely play this role. But, The producer already has an actress. There she is. Come on, stand by! Luna? If you don't choose me because I can't play the role, fine. But Luna ? Shit! If you give me that role, I would do anything you wanted me to. You know what I mean, don't you? / Later. Good day, Sir. How is it? Is everything running smoothly? I brought you some food. Hi, Stella. Make up and costume, please check Luna! I think I'm ready with my make up and costume./ Alright. What scene are we doing now? / 17. / What? I don't think I've memorized that part. Just relax. How about we go ahead and take our lunch break first? What do you think? Okay, sure. Lunch break! Come here, baby. Smile. Come on. How could you? You didn't even tell me that you got the part. / I'm sorry. I just couldn't do it. You know I love you. I know you do, but what you did was wrong. Please forgive me. How was it? Was it a success? What's happened to you? I just went out with a crazy guy. But I'm alright. You're all black and blue. / No, it's fine. It'll go away. I swear, I'm alright. How was it? Success? / What success? Big zero. Do you know who finally got the role? Luna./ Luna? She got the role cus she's got a special relationship with the producer. You know who was really meant to get the part? So, Biyan should've gotten that part? / All she had to do was sign the contract. You should've told me! You should've taken it! So many people work their asses off to get a part and this idiot gets it, and rejects it. I couldn't do it. Why? Because of me? I know you really wanted the part. / But look what's happened now. I didn't get the part either. Luna got it. / I got my period! I got my period! What? You got your period? / Yes! Congratulations! Stella! / Stella! Tonight is the second night of Stella's disappearance. Through the melancholy of the dark shadows of the night, I can feel just how much she's hurting. Oh God, Why did You permit Luna to get that role? Why didn't Stella gets the part? The part that should've been mine all along. God, although I know that Luna's your creation, She's in desperate need of acting lessons. Well? Her phone's not active. It's all your fault! Why me? You know how scared I am of getting pregnant. When I realized I'd gotten my period, It's only natural for me to be happy about it. But you need to learn to pick your moments! There's casting for an advertisement. A soap advertisement. I'm sure if you audition for this, you'll get the part. And it won't take you very long to defeat Luna's popularity. But it's a soap advertisement. So what? I think you'll have to make some changes but there's no reason to freak out. I'll help you. You're so nice to me. Here. Hi, guys! Look what I brought with me! Patience, patience. There's casting for a soap advertisement. I think you should audition for it. Come on! Wait a minute. Your slippers! I just registered for you. You're up next. How come we don’t have to wait? Look at my slippers! / Oh, my God! Use my shoes. Just remember, do whatever you have to. But make sure you get the part. Stella! Just put them on over there. Hurry up! I can't believe she was wearing these stupid slippers. How did it go? I'll get the part. I'm very sure. To the birth of a star! To our friendship! Success for Stella! There're boys! Give one for me! Hi, bitch. Here. I've got an invitation for you. It's Marix's birthday party. I invited you on purpose. Because all this time, I know he's always been a part of your dreams. So I'd like to share my happiness with you. So I'd like to share my happiness with you. Just calm down! Okay, bitch? Bitch! You only dared to fight Biyan! If you've got the guts, find yourself an equal opponent! This is between you and me! I'm curious. How far can someone like you go? We’ll play truth or dare. / Truth or dare? Alright. Where? / Up to you. Here. Okay. Okay. Alright. Where? / Up to you. The loser has to take off her clothes. And her underwear. If you lose, You'll have to do what I did. But if I lose, I'll have to take it all off. Open! Which challenge do you choose? To get naked or give blow jobs? Do it right! Make love! With one man? / Two men. / Three men. Thank you. You stood up for me and defended me against Luna. But what you did didn't make me happy. It made me sad. I don't want to be helped that way. I know how you feel about Marix. I don't like you being insulted by Luna like that. I like Marix. I will get him with, love. Something you wouldn't understand. Stella, please promise me you won't be sad. This is for you. But promise me you won't get upset. / What is it? My God, what did they tell you to do at the audition? I'm in this porn VCD? I'm all ruined. I'm totally ruined. I'm gonna be the butt of Luna's jokes. I'm gonna be the butt of everyone's jokes. You have to get Marix from Luna. You have to get him! Ladies! This is so cool. Whose car is it?/ I borrowed it. Where did you get it from? / From Cebol. You borrowed it from Cebol? How else would you wanna go to the party? With a bajaj? Did you think of the huge risk? If it gets scratched, We could get in so much trouble. / Just finish putting on your make up. Go. Bye. Friends! I'd like your attention please. Tonight is a very special night for Marix. And of course, a special night for me. You know what I'm sayin'? As Marix's girlfriend, I'm so very proud. I'm also very sure that a lot of you here are jealous of me. But today, I'd like to share with all of you. I'd like to give all the girls and boys here who like him, the opportunity to get him and make love to him. Wouldn't you want to know how to do that? Tonight, Marix is to be auctioned. Whoever places the highest bid, will get him, and sleep with him. So. Get up / Get up! / Get up! Take it off! 200 thousand! 300 thousand! 2 million! 2.1 million! 2.2 million! / 2.3 million! 2.4 million! / 2.5 million! 2.6 million! / 2.7 million! 2.8 million! / 3 million! 3.1 million! / 3.3 million! 3.5 million! / 4 million! 5 million! What are you gonna do now? Stop! Shut up! Friends, we’re holding hand But our perspective are different Friends, we’re all running But not in the same direction Go, Biyan. I’m a virgin I don’t regret this I’m a virgin Am I boring? Because my perspective is different Am I not following the rules? Because I don’t follow your principle I’m a virgin I don’t regret this / I’m a virgin I don’t care If people said I’m out-of date For me virginity is important to hang on to And I’m sure God will give me the most beautiful place Thank you. Marix! I placed the highest bid! So tonight is my night with you! Not your night with that stupid slut! Tonight, I become a gigolo! For the success of this event, I'm ready to sleep with whoever bids the highest! Everybody here knows who's paying you the most! Me! Luna! I know that Luna's offered the pay the most. To be honest, I'm very flattered. Thank you. But as a gigolo and the organizer of this event... ... I'm under the impression that the person who's willing to pay the highest price is Biyan! No way.. Because of her effort, my event can still go on. If she didn't step up, our fighting wouldn't have stopped. I'm so thankful for her tonight. But to be honest, I've made a big mistake. / What? I just can't lie to myself, Because I've fallen in love with her. Come on! Let’s go Luna. Honestly, Bi. I love you. I can't do this. We just can't be together. Why? We can't be together? Don't confuse me. Just now, you kissed me.. You told me you loved me. And now all of a sudden you're telling me that our love can't be united. Without offering any kind of explanation? Why? Why can't our love be united? Did you hear from my friends? That I'm still a virgin? Do you think that I can't give you what you want? I Know, I've known a lot of girls who are willing to do everything for me. And for all this time, I've known how to avoid it. But this time, I just can't deny what I'm feeling. From the first moment I saw you, I fell in love. But I know I'll never make you happy. Don't you have faith in me? I just can't do this. But why? Tell me. Please. However bad your reason is, I'll accept it. I'm.... Say it. I'm... You know what I mean. / Just say it. My thing is small. What? Your thing is small? Very small. I've been so scared. I've been so haunted by fear. Fear that I wouldn't be able to tell the girl I love. I just don't know whether to be sad or angry.. After hearing that your explanation, for this was your small thing. But what's clear is that right now, I love you. I care about you. The car is gone! Cebol's car is gone! Calm down. I'll help you. Please help us. Look over there. I'll check the highway. I'll call the cops. / Hurry up. I have to pee. We need to be brave to face him. Don't scare me, too. / It's not that, Stel Do you remember when I was at the parking lot? When my face was full of bruises? Yes, I remember. I had just gone out with him. He's really sadistic. He's the kind of guy that gets pleasure out of torturing people. What's it called? We don't have any choice. We have to meet him. You know what he's like. If we run or hide, he'll still track us down. No! We have to face him. Right? / Yes. What's wrong? Is there a scratch on my car? Then? The car is gone! Why is it so hard just to tell me that my car is gone? It's alright. It's an ordinary car. It's up to you how you'd like to replace it. If you'd like to exchange it with money, that's fine. If you'd rather exchange it with the same car, that's alright. Or have you got another offer for me? ...And you have silky, smooth skin. You guys saw what it was like in there, didn't you? He has a lot of hookers. How much money can we earn? There's only the three of us! How long do we have to earn money? What did you say? The three of us? I'm not getting involved in this. I borrowed that car so that you could go out with Marix. But you didn't have to borrow it from Cebol, did you? Especially from Cebol. You remember what I said at the stairs, right? Before leaving for home Cebol, time on the stairs, remind. I said! "No, Stel. Don't." Use your car instead. Then what did you say? It's alright. It's my responsibility. You remember, don't you? I didn't say that. I just said that we must be careful. If the car is missing like this, all of us have to take responsibility. You bitch! You're the one who borrowed that car! / If was in your interest, you bitch! Help! We have to exchange that car. Is that all? You didn't give me all of it, did you? Where's your jewelry? / What about it? I gave up my virginity for work. Not for unpaid work like this. If I knew we were gonna end up this way, I should've just been Biyan. After she ended up with Marix, we're the one doing all the hard work, and all she can do is stay quiet. Take responsibility! With each passing day, Stella and Kettie are getting worse. In a state of depression, they're selling all their valuable belongings. They sold their car, all their jewelry, Even their pride and dignity. They're collecting money bit by bit just to exchange that cursed car. I have to be resist the urge. I don't want to give up my virginity. In a state of depression, they're selling all their valuable belongings. But what about Stella and Kettie? Oh God, I just don't know what it is that I'm supposed to do. There's a guy looking for a virgin. He's willing to pay a high price. He's not that old. He's in his forties. Of course, only if you want to. What's wrong with you, Ket? I'm pregnant! You're bad luck! It's all because of you! If you weren't so crazy about Marix, Our fates wouldn't have ended up this way! You know why we borrowed that car! Now you have your Marix. But the car is gone. Gone! Stella's been working so hard to exchange that car. But you're doing nothing! / Shut up! We're in a mess! Stella is in a porn VCD. I'm pregnant! PREGNANT! What are you doing? At lease your virginity! But even that wouldn't be enough! Okay. Okay. I will sell my virginity. Just let me know. When and where . I have to sacrifice my chastity. Stella said that tomorrow night, I was expected at a hotel. For the first time in my life, I wanted to spit at her face, Because I couldn't believe she had the heart to do this to me.
