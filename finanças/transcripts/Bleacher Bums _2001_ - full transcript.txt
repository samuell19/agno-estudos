All right, let's go. Here we go. Peanuts! Get your peanuts! Daddy? Two. Okay. Charge! ...so drop whatever you're doing and come on down to the ballpark. No, no, bring the baby along, bring the whole family down... ...to watch your Chicago Bruins battle it out with their arch rivals, the Eagles from St. Louis. You know, Tim, with the All-Star Game behind both the Bruins and the Eagles can set their sights on an outside chance still to make a wildcard run. That's right, Ron. And as they kick off a twelve-game home stand... So I'll see you later. Okay, have a good time. Hey, ten bucks, come on. Tickets! Right here. Tickets, tickets. Right here, right here. All right, all right. Put your money where your mouth is. That's what I'm saying. Put your money where your mouth is. We're a million miles away. What did you pay for this? I don't know. Too much. Who wants to sit here? There's no backs and we can't see anything. Okay, Dad, what do you want to do? No, no, no, no... You bought 'em; we'll sit. Need a fucking telescope. You guys from out of town? Yeah. Yeah. So... what do you know about the Bruins? They suck. What about the inventory? You can do it. Have a good time. We've got a delivery coming. I trust you. You're not taking the car? No. You're walking for luck, huh? Ah, why not? They lost eight in a row. Well, that means they're due. Sorry, guys, that was me. That's all right. It's okay. Let's take it from the beat three entrance, okay? One, two... One, two, three... Whoa, David, guys... I don't have the money. Whoa! You don't have the money, man? Come on. It's like two days. How much of it don't you have? I don't have any of it. What have you been doing? If David had the money, he'd pay for it... He knows, he knows, he knows. Look, Joey we've got a studio on Wednesday and we've got an engineer on Wednesday. And four-fifths of the money. The bank told me if I get a cosigner... I don't want to hear anything about that. I just want to hear you come in on cue, all right? Good. Let's take it from the top. ...I see the classic summer fashion statement is back this year in the bleachers. Whoa, there's my fashion statement right there, Ron! My future ex-wife. They dance to their own drummer out there. And tell me something, Ron: what is it about a camera a kielbasa and a couple of beers that turns... Oh, oh, oh! I'm sure that's not what she had in mind, even on a scorcher like today. Hope she brought a Bruins T-shirt, that's for sure. Today or never. Manager George Reed has already looked at the numbers... Numbers don't win games! Intangibles win games! These announcers, these announcers... It's not about numbers. It's not about stats, am I right? It's about passion. It's about redemption. Calling up Ozu's the best thing we could have done. You don't think he knows he's been hitting a buck-75 since the All-Star break? He'll be looking for payback. You know what I mean. Forget about his stats. Who gives a shit? He'll bring passion to the game! See what I'm saying? No. Forward, men of Chi! That was 1945, the last time we won the pennant. An amazing year. Of course, that was before there was ivy on the walls. But really you've got to go back to 1908 the last time we won the World Series to get the whole picture. Excuse me... I'm saving this seat. But it's not reserved up here. No, no, I know. I'm saving it for a friend. Isn't it first come, first served? Yes, it is, but I'm saving it for a friend, Mr. Decker. It's his lucky seat. It's not lucky if he doesn't sit in it. Come on, pal, can't you just, um... That's all right anyway. Oh, great, thanks a lot. It's no problem. I appreciate it. Sorry, excuse me. So anyway, 1908. Imagine two generations... Hey, Greg! Excuse me. Mr. Z. Good to see you. Good to see you. You got a seat for me? I sure do, same old, same old. That's the one. How you doing? Ah, better by the minute. Let's go, Bruins! Let's go, Bruins! Let's go, Bruins! Let's go, Bruins! Let's go, Bruins! Just the man I'm looking for. I believe I hold your marker. Hey, Deck. Daddy, I see Mean Green! Hey, you're right. Number 29, Dayton Green. Mean Green, Mean Green. Mean Green, Mean Green. Hey, Deck, I'd have found you, you know what I mean? I know that. So, are we going to win, bud? We're going to win! Yeah! We are going to win. I know. You're raising a very intelligent young man. Hey, Zigala. Ah, Commodore. How you doing there, Greg? Mr. D. Who you got today? What do I got today? What, are you kidding me? I don't think I've seen you around here, Miss... King. Miss King. It's only my second time at a baseball game. I heard the sun was good in the right field bleachers. Oh, screw Acapulco. This is it. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Thanks. Hey, Decker I got two guys to bet with me on the game, six to five. You giving the six or getting? Huh? Both. What about you, Zig? You want to bet with me? I'll give you six to five. All you're giving me is a pain in the ass. Hey, hey, I'm sitting here. I'm sitting here. You can't sit there, get up. Get up. Get up, get up. Get out of there. I can sit anywhere I want. Whenever you come in here do you have to touch everybody? Don't touch me, all right? Don't touch me. And you're not sitting there. What, are you president of the bleachers now? That's right. Richie, I don't think Zig wants you sitting so close to him. Why don't you sit, uh... Okay, I got my lucky scorekeeper I got my lucky seat, it's going to be a good day. Come on, Deck, you want to make a bet? Uh, you want to go on the gate? Okay, uh... Wow, looks big, I'm going to go with 30,000. 32... no, 31... You like 31. Yeah. I like 33. I get everything under 33? All right, you get everything under 33. For a buck. For a buck, you're on. Looks like we got 35 already. Yeah, for how much? A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and box seats at the World Series. Greggy... Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls have your pencils and scorecards ready. Here are the starting line-ups for today's game. For St. Louis... Boo! Yeah! ...Batting fourth, playing first base number 36, Michael McGuinn. Boo! You 70-homer piece of shit! He's amazing, isn't he? Unbelievable. The size of his forearms. Looks at a ball, goes over the fence. Bam! Well, it's a complete set. I've already been offered $1,500 for it. Batting seventh... Yes, I have it up on the screen now. But you see, that's just one of the complete set. Oh, yes, well, you let me know. And give me a call back when you arrive at some price you're comfortable with. Okay. ...Rowland Keough. Boo! Boo! I hate this guy, Keough. I hate him. Why's he even playing? He killed us last time. Maybe that's why he's playing. Oh, shut up. And batting ninth the pitcher, number 56, Ray Lincoln. Get out of here! Take a walk, you bum! Stinkin' Lincoln! And now... the starting lineup for your Chicago Bruins! Leading off and playing center field number 17, Sammy Barnes! Streak! Streak! Batting second playing second base, number 29, Dayton Green. Mean Green! Mean Green! Batting third, playing first base number 37, Darren Hale. Hail to the Chief! Batting fourth playing right field, number 58, Manny Losa. MVP! MVP! ...Batting seventh and playing shortstop, just back from the disabled list number 18, D.J. Ozu. Batting eighth and catching, number 51, Scott Sheffield. Sheff! Sheff! Sheff! Sheff! And batting ninth and pitching, number 30 Kyle Riddick! All right, Riddie! All right, Kyle, all right, way to go, Riddie! He won't make it past the seventh inning. They'll have to bring in Todd Heck. Todd "Give 'em Hell" Heck? That's our man. And now, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, please rise for our national anthem. Come on, Deck, how about a game bet? Richie, it's the national anthem. ♪ O, say can you see ♪ ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ ♪ What so proudly we hailed ♪ ♪ At the twilight's last gleaming... ♪ Hey, you got a light? Oh, okay. ♪ And the rocket's red glare ♪ ♪ The bombs bursting in air ♪ ♪ Gave proof through the night ♪ ♪ That our flag was still there ♪ ♪ O, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave ♪ ♪ O'er the land of the free ♪ ♪ And the home of the brave. ♪ Let's get a game. let's get a game. Come on, Kyle. Hey, Decker, look who I found loitering around? Hey, son. Hey, Dad. Hey, Joey, look at you! Hey, Mr. Zigkowski, how you doing? Come here. Sit down. ...Left fielder B.J. Malone. Boo! Come on, Kyle! Come on, Riddick! Hey, Skippy, move over. Move over where? Come on, Rich, just move. Come on, Kyle. Dad, I'm not staying for the whole game. Yeah, uh-huh. That's okay, yeah. Are you hungry? Yeah, I could eat. Listen, Richie, would you get us some hot dogs? Would you like a hot dog, miss? Deck, I just got here. Well, you'll just get back. Here, get five hot dogs. Get the change, and no mustard. Well, actually, mustard, no relish. Forget the relish just get the mustard, all right? You're out! Ozu to Hale. Ozu eats up a grounder to start the game. What was that? What was that? Okay, I'm down with the home team. What kind of odds you want, Zig? Who do you think you're talking to? You got the Bruins? I got the Bruins. I'm shocked. He wants the Bruins. You want to bet the Eagles? I can't. It's bad luck if I bet the Eagles. I ain't betting against the Bruins. I'm not betting the Eagles. So don't. What does that mean? That means do it my way. We can both ride the same train without getting off at the same stop. Okay, okay... Do we see this act every day or what? All right, we'll both bet the Bruins winning margin. Oh, all right, winning margin. I say we're going to win by at least three. Who's going today? Riddick and Lincoln, the two aces. All right! Yes! Yeah, babe. Pitcher's duel? On paper. All right, uh, I say we win by two or less. You got two or less. I got three or more. What's the price? $50. $50? That's good. Okay, we got our bet. Come on, Kyle! I'll take some of that. I got the visitors. I'm giving even money. You betting those St. Louis assholes? Yeah, today I'm betting the St. Louis assholes. Tomorrow I'll bet the Pittsburgh assholes and the next week I'll bet the Philadelphia assholes. I'm addicted to winning. I'm covering all available action. Yeah, all right! Three pitches, three strikes. Hey, you want to go $100 right now? You got it. Can you believe these two guys, Joey? Whatever, Dad, it's a free country. Not up here, it ain't. I had one with relish... You put your own condiments on them. I know, I just... I don't get paid enough to do it for you. Who was that, Manzanilla? Come on, man. People are waiting. I just need to know who was out. An Eagle. Who the fuck cares which one? What can I get you, man? Two hot dogs, a couple of beers. I care. And some chips. I care. Zig, three up, three down. It's the start we're looking for. You hear that, Marvin? Three up, three down. It's our day. You ought to get a piece of this. You going to back up your boys? Plenty of time, Marvin. I'll take a piece of that. What are we betting? We are not betting anything! Just hand out the... Dad. Hand out the dogs? Can I talk to you for a couple seconds? Yeah, sure, want a hot dog? Leading off, number 17, center fielder Sammy Bar... Leading off, number 17, center fielder Sammy Barnes! I say Sammy gets on. Who wants to bet? I say he don't reach. Even money he reaches, $20. Charge! What are you doing? What am I doing? I'm betting my man Sammy. Sure thing if ever I saw one. In his dreams he doesn't make that catch! That was a lucky catch! Yeah, lucky for me, Zig. Keough-- I'm starting to hate that guy. Dad, so, can we talk? Yeah, what's on your mind? Batting for Bruins, second baseman, Mean Green! Mean Green! Mean Green! Green'll get on. You know, he shook off that groin pull. I'll bet you double or nothing. Double or nothing? You're down. What are you doing? It's a sure thing. A sure thing? Why don't you just give him your money now? Why not just give me your money? The money you'll lose to me. What's the count? 0 and 1. Ow! It's early in the game, Zig. You got to watch these guys for a few innings first. You know what I mean? Get a feel for the game. I can feel it. He's a clutch hitter. Zig, look, let me tell you something. Next time you want to get down on a reach/no reach bet you don't offer even money. Even the best of these guys they only get on three out of ten times. Hey, hey, hey. Don't tell me what's a good bet, please. The man is taking your money, Zig. You ought to listen to him. Marvin how long you been coming out here, huh? I've been coming out here for 20 years, Marvin. 20 years! You're telling me how to bet? That was a really stupid bet, though. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's what I need. I need this schmuck telling me that it was a dumb bet. Yeah, yeah, I need Bobo the Chimp here... Why don't you go sit someplace else, huh? I don't need this, all right? You want to sit there, then shut the fuck up and don't say another word to me! Don't say nothing to me. Next batter, playing first base, Darren Hale. Dad? Yeah? Okay, me and the guys are trying to put together a CD... Out! Keough, you shithead! Stinking bastard! Only against the Bruins. Dad. Long as it's against the Bruins. Dad, come on, already. Sorry, Joey, what were you saying? We're making the CD this week... What about a score bet on this inning? It's too early. I never take these early score bets. You think St. Louis is going to score? I think so. Even money on 20 bucks? I'll take that bet. That's a good bet. Riddick looks strong today. I know it's a good bet. McGuinn's always trouble. Charge! When are they going to put the Bruins' zero on the scoreboard? What the hell do those guys do up there? What do you think they do? What? What, you ain't heard stories what goes on up there? No. What do you think? You think they just put up the score? Yeah. They got broads up there. That is a fact. I seen 'em take beers up there. Well, there you are. Speaking of which who would like to get me a beer? I'll go get the beers. There you go. Marv, don't be sending my kid out for beers. I'm not a kid and nobody's sending me. Oh, wait a minute, Joey. I'll go with you. ...Michael McGuinn. I understand. I'm just trying to find out more about... Oh, my God, can this guy throw! Come on, you don't still get a little shiver when you see a 90-mile-an-hour fast ball? No, 'cause I never threw 90. Yeah, 90, I clocked you. Oh, I did not. Anyway, how much money do you need? I don't need money. Oh, I'm sorry. I misunderstood. No, I need you to cosign a loan for me. Joey, that's money; if you fail to repay the loan who do you think's got to come up with the money? Oh, shit! Damn! Two bases. Sorry, how much do you need? It's two grand for my share. Two grand? And each guy's going to contribute? Yes. All right. How long's the loan for? It's for a year. A year. Is this band going to be together for a year? Oh, you think this is some kind of phase I'm going through? Oh, I get it, I see. It's me dumping the baseball scholarship No, no... dumping college, and I'll dump this. Stop it. I just don't want to see you stuck behind the eight ball. Can I help you, sir? Yeah, we'd like... Oh, damn! Just go. No, it's all right, I... I'll get it. You sure? Yes. You got money? Yes. I'll be back in a minute. W-Wait, do I get Zig a beer? No, he doesn't drink anymore. High blood pressure. Throw home! Throw home, you moron! These guys just ain't playing right. You ain't betting right. Oh, I'm betting right. It's them; they're not playing right. I'm not out there playing. They should be down there... I should be up... Oh, the hell with it! You know what I mean! All right, all right! Yeah, finally, one out. Double or nothing they score another run? Double or nothing? That's what I'm saying. You're on. Hey, Zig, Richie's got his finger up his nose. Three to five he takes it out. Three to five? Next batter Rowland Keough. A-hole! Keyhole. Keyhole? Ke-ogh. A-hole... Ke-ogh, A-hole Ke-ogh, A-hole? ♪ Ke-ogh, A-hole, Ke-ogh, A-hole ♪ ♪ Ke-ogh, A-hole, Ke-ogh. ♪ I hate this guy, Keough. I hate him. How come he hits so good against the Bruins? You're a freak, Keough, a freak! Get out of here, you freak! What's he hitting? Around .250. He must be hitting .450 against us. Right-center. He falls down, you freak! Hurry up! Throw it in! Throw it in! Safe! Play baseball! They've got to throw the ball! You've got to catch the ball and then throw it! You can't just hold it and let them run around the bases. What are you going to do, scare 'em? Give 'em hell, Zig. Ah! Well, my game bet's looking pretty good, Zig. Three runs for the Eagles already. Oh, come on, Deck, the Bruins ain't playing right. I mean, there's something wrong out there. And a hush falls over the crowd. It's a little early for the seventh-inning stretch wouldn't you say, Ron? Looks like your friend out there. I believe it is-- I just remember blonde hair. And what is this with money? For Pete's sake, you'd think we were in Cincinnati. : Shit! Did you guys notice where that camera was pointing? The cameraman? What camera? Richie, get a camera. Richie, give me the score sheet. I was betting how they was playing yesterday. Zig, you trying to get out of the bet? Is this the third out? Oh, no, no, no, it's still two down. Come on, Deck, I mean, the Bruins just ain't playing right today. What are you saying? Nah, it's just, you know. No, I don't know. You trying to get out of the bet? No, I... You been shoveling money into Marvin's pocket the past 20 minutes. Now you tell me you want out of our bet? Is that what you're asking me to do? Look, I'm just saying they ain't playing right. That's all I'm saying. No, no, no. Don't tell me about "They ain't playing right." Just tell me if you want out of the bet. Hey, look, I just want the Bruins to play right, that's all. No, no. You want the bet or not? No, let's call it off, okay? For you, Zigala, anything. All right, everybody hold it a goddamn minute! I wouldn't let him out of that bet. That was a stupid bet. You're lucky you weren't betting with me, Zigala. Hey, hey, never call me by my name. Don't you ever call me by my name when you talk to me! Hey, Richie, get some Frosty Malts for everybody. Get one for yourself, too. Go, go. Go, go, go, go! What are you doing? You're letting... What the hell are you doing? Calm down, Marvin. Come on, a guy makes a bet, he has to stand behind it. Hey, why don't you mind your own business? Stay out of this, Zig. You'll get your turn. Now look, it's not exactly... We're gambling here. I know, but this isn't Vegas. Well, it ain't Uncle Fuck's Tickle Hut either! Marvin, look, Zig and I have been betting together for 20 years. No, you don't understand. It's a bad example, okay? You're letting him out of a bet, so what does that mean, huh? If I want to be a good guy, I got to let him out of the bet? I never asked... Zig. You ain't got to be a good guy. Okay, well, it's tough enough playing with these nickel- and-dimers here. I am not a ni... I'm just trying to make a couple of dollars here, okay? So for you to let these guys out of a bet it's fucking ludicrous. What can I tell you? Start an off-park betting service. I come here because I can't lose, okay? Otherwise I'd be at the fucking track. Come on, loser! Bruin fans, it's time for that old standby... Eagles suck! Eagles suck! Eagles suck! Eagles suck! Eagles suck! Eagles suck! Eagles suck! Eagles suck! Now batting for the Bruins, Jesus Corrales. You used to throw that hard. Hey, Decker, okay, look, let's quit putzing around, huh? What do you say you and me make a serious bet on this game here, huh? I mean, you like your boys, right? You still like them three runs down? Come on, what do you say? A little action, just you and me? I don't know. What, you think you can take me? You're three runs down. What do you want, hmm? I'll give you eight to five. Nine to five. $900, my $900, against your $500, right now. Mm... Two to fucking one. My thousand against your $500. You know, Marvin... Make me a bet! ...they say gambling is a disease. And when it reaches its terminal stages there are signs, like the veins in your forehead throbbing when you're telling me these odds. Oh, you're the surgeon fucking general now! Those little veins going, "eight to five, nine to five!" They got inoculations for things like that. Come on! Bruins got the power! Bruins got the power! Bruins got the power. Hold it! This section! What are you doing? We need your hearts. Without you, this tribe will not survive. Here's five bucks. Bump up the medication. I'm a Bruins fan! I cannot be bought. Here, then get an enema. I'll be back. And you better be ready, because we got work to do. Working for the Bruins every night and day, 24/7. And that's going to be the score because we're going to put our hittin' shoes on and murder these bums! Shit! Eagles suck! Eagles suck! Eagles suck! Hey, you know what I like about that guy is he's dedicated, you know? I'll say. That's what happens when the fetus doesn't get enough air. Okay, Frosty Malts. Who gets one? Oh, I would love a Frosty Malt. Okay. Give me a fucking Frosty Malt. One for Marvin in the back. Go ahead, here, for Greg. Put it in his hand. Richie, put it in his hand! I ain't going to have one, then. So you'll get another... Frosty Malts, yo! He's over there. But put it in his hand first. Go, go, go, go, go! Thanks, Richie. Mr. D? Yeah? This Frosty Malt doesn't have a spoon. All right, use mine. What'll you use? I got another. Thanks. All right, I'm thinking of making a score bet here. Who wants a piece of it? Why don't we just watch the game for a while? ...Chico Gonzalez. You ever been inside the scoreboard, Decker? Sure. Bullshit. What's it like? Yeah! Greg, what happened? Ground out. Six-three. Okay, what's it like inside the scoreboard? Well, it's like Heaven, Richie. The last stop where they add up all the runs, hits and errors. Where do you come up with this crap? You know what, Marvin? Just to make sure you don't have a stroke how much you want to bet St. Louis doesn't score in this inning? Fifteen hundred dollars. I'm trying to make a friendly wager here. I don't want to put my car into hock. You're an asshole, Keough! Okay, okay, okay, Diamond Jim. There's one away. The odds are in your favor. What do you want to go? Ke-ogh! A-hole! Two-to-one on a sawbuck they don't score. Four-to-one. Two and a half. Make it three. Two and three quarters. Stop fucking around! Okay, if you want the bet it's three-to-one. Okay, okay, three-to-one, sawbuck. You're saying St. Louis scores. Right. And I'm saying they don't. Right, and you're giving me odds. Yeah, I know, just to keep me honest, I got it. You're an embarrassment. Okay, okay, that's two outs. This looks like a sure thing now. I'll take the same bet. You ain't taking nothing. I got money. Wait, you ready for the big time, Richie? Huh? You can handle this? I can handle it. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what? Just hold on to your lunch money, Richie, huh? Let the men bet. Eat it, Marv. How much is a sawbuck, Richie? I know how much it is. Three to one Eagles don't score, a sawbuck. I'll take your bet, Richie. Don't do that, Joey. You don't know how it works up here. Course I know how it works. You're on, brother. All right, let it go, Deck. Hey, you got your kid, you got your lucky scorekeeper. It's a regular battle of titans. Excuse me! Excu-- Where's the bleacher entrance? Okay, great, thanks. Okay, two away. Who's up, Greg? Lincoln, the pitcher. Looks like I got you, Marv. Looks like I got you, Joey. I don't know. He's a pretty good hitting pitcher. Throw it back! Throw it back! Why do they throw the ball back? Don't they want to keep it for a souvenir? Lady, when somebody shits in your hat you gotta let them know what time it is. That's true. Mr. D, you watch my stuff for me? But they're still up. They're not going to be when I get back. All right, get me a beer, would you? Sure, no problem. Here you go. Anybody else want anything? No. Move, now I can't see. Twenty bucks he brings you a cheese sandwich. Yeah. As long as it's got a head on it. Shouldn't somebody go with him maybe? Oh, don't worry, he'll be all right. Unless you want to go. No, I don't know him. Marvin, here you go. I'll get you next time. Thirty bucks. I'm rich. Oh... Wait. Thirty? What? That's three to one on $10. That's 30 bucks, Richie. Wait, no, no, no. Three to one on a saw-- Richie, I tried to tell you. Why did you take that bet? I took the bet because I thought I was going to win. Yeah, but you didn't. What can I tell you? I don't have the Midas touch. You can't win 'em all. I just lost 30 bucks because of you. Thanks, Richie. I hate to say it, but I lost, too. Yeah, I know, but you've got money. You can afford it. I don't. Hey, you want to wager a buck or two here or there you know I'll play with you. But I'm always telling you not to get involved when I'm betting with guys like this. So, you jumped up and got burned? Now you know how it feels. Meanwhile, why don't you just stick to keeping score? Why don't you stick it, Decker! Oh, shit. I asked you not to bet with him. I know, I got it. Relax, Deck, your kid's a winner. It's nice to have one in the family. : I can do what I want. Richie? Richie! First up for the Bruins, Kyle Riddick. Mr. D? Riddick, you putz! I got it, I got it. See? Now this is exactly the point. This is how the American League ruined Riddick, you know? Because he can't bunt, he can't... Still think we're going to get 35,000 people? Uh, about 31 or 32 right now, with more coming. What do you do? Count their feet and divide by two? No, I can feel 'em. Here's your change. No, wait a second, what is that? What's the bill? Oh, it's a... it's... gone. No, come on, what is it? It's a five. Oh, very good, I'm impressed. Come on, Sammy! Come on! Streak, streak, streak. You can do it. Let's go, Sammy. Come on, Sam, you can do it, baby! Come on, Sammy! Excuse me? How did you do that with the bill? Oh, that's easy. Lincoln has a beard. Washington has wavy hair. Jackson has bushy eyebrows. And Hamilton is looking to the right... Come on, come on. If it wasn't a five, that means the lady at the beer stand ripped off a blind guy. All right, babes, come on, hit it in there! Herb! Holy shit. Herb? Say, Herb, you've got company. Rose, what's the matter? What happened? Is there something wrong? Look, if you're going to come down here every day and just throw our money away, I'm at least entitled to come down here sometimes and watch you do it. Excuse me. Don't be silly. Do you have to talk so loud? Was I talking loud? Sit down! She's going to sit down. Please, sit down. You can't sit there, though. You gotta sit someplace else. Herb, I can sit here. I'm sitting here. No, actually, you can't see, because, uh... a friend is sitting there, and I'm sav... Oh, here he is, here he is. Hello, Richie! Richie, this is my wife, Rose. Rose, this is Richie. Richie just went to get me a beer... a-a-a root beer. Uh, Richie... Rich, where you going? I saved your seat. What are you talking about? I'm sitting up here next to Marvin. Don't be a prick, buddy. Herb, you're missing the game. Yeah, Herb. I'm not missing nothing, and don't call me that. I came down to find out how much money you threw away this afternoon. What are you talking about? I didn't throw away nothing. I don't know, Herb. Now batting for the Bruins, Dayton Green. Mean Green! Mean Green! Hey, Richie, listen, I know you didn't understand that bet so we can just forget the whole thing. I'll give you your money back. A bet's a bet; I pay my debts. Ain't no welcher like some people. Hey, who are you calling a welcher you little pinhead? Listen, I been betting here for 20 years. I never welched on a bet, even when I've had big losses, and... Zig... Not today. Not today. Good. Good, then I guess we can just sit here and watch the game. Sure, yeah. Good. Hey, Zig, there's your boy Green. I bet he don't reach. I'll tell you what I'm going to do and you know that this isn't like me. He's been reaching all day. I bet you for the next ten seconds only that this guy don't reach. Even money, huh? Five seconds. Three... two... I guess you didn't hear him. He's not betting. He's not interested. I'm sorry. Hey, hey, hey. I'm terribly sorry. Hey, don't do that. Don't tell him I'm not interested. I'm interested. If I want to wager with this man that's exactly what I'm going to do. But I choose not to, and it's not betting, it's a science. You've got to work on it every day... While you come down here and piss our money down some bottomless toilet I'm home working. Oh, you're working? Oh, no, no, no-- I work, I work. Now you're saying I don't work? You believe that I don't work? That's not what I'm saying. I said I earn the money. ...and if I want to come here and bet it that's what I'm going to do. And I say he reaches! He grounded out. You see that, Rose?! That's money! That's money! You cost me money! That was money in the bank! Zig, you would have lost. I come here to relax. I come down here to one place where I can be myself. Zig! What?! He made out; you would have lost. Well, then I bet the next guy reaches. 50 bucks. $50? That's right, 50 bucks. Who the fuck is up, Greg? Manzanilla. Eagles number two hitter. Oh, shit, that's the wrong team. Uh... Then I bet he don't reach. Yeah, I'll bet two to one. I'll go three to one. I don't think it's wise for me to get involved at this juncture. How much was that bet? Richie... 50 bucks. Three to one? You can only win $50, and you're going to lose $150... Well, thanks for your support. ...in this five minutes. Do you know what we could do with $150 every five minutes? Why don't you tell me, Rose? What, buy more fancy paperweights? Now batting, Luis Manzanilla. That storm's getting closer. Does a walk count as a reach? Yes. I'll take that bet, Zigala. I'll bet with you. Fifty? For a ten. A sawbuck. All right, all right! Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait... Oh, no, no, no, you're on, you're in the book. All right, let's go, this guy is easy. Come on, let's take him out. A hit! A hit, I won! Pay up, Zigala. There goes the first 150. What are you talking about? That's not $150. That's only three to one on a sawbuck; that's $30. I just saved us $120. Come on, come on, come on... Marvin, I won. I don't know, Decker. Looks a little tragic today. I smell a shutout. It's still early yet, Marvin. What, do you think those loxes are going to win this game? Huh, they're going to pull through; this is their year? This is the year. Want to know what your problem is, Decker? You got no balls. Oh, please. You got balls. You know what I told him? I'd give him two to one-- my thousand against his 500. And he didn't take it? Not Mr. Bruin. Come on, Turner! Turner, yes! I'd even make it 11 to five. 11 to five, and he ain't gonna take it. You're betting 11 to five on the Eagles? What are you doing? No action from this guy. He squeezes a nickel so hard, the buffalo shits. Batting for the Eagles, Michael McGuinn. This is a big at-bat. You're going down, McGuinn, you're going down. It isn't really his money. See, he books this little nickel-and-dime stuff. Two dollars here, four dollars there. So he's really playing with someone else's money. That's why he's so cautious, see? It's really little-old-lady money, isn't it, Decker? "The buffalo shits!" I'll make it 13 to fucking five, are you happy? Oh, shit, take the five! You'd have to be some kind of a schmuck not to take that. I'd take it, but he doesn't have the guts. Yeah. Well, no, I know what it is. You know what? He just can't cover it. You know how many bats and balls Mr. Bruin would have to sell to cover that big? You know what, Marvin? I'm going to take your money. But you have the odds wrong. What do you want? No odds; even money. How much? Two grand. Oh, you're down! All right, let's go! Come on, Kyle! Come on, Kyle! Throw that third strike, throw it, baby! Come on, baby! Come on! Strike three! Time! Bring it in! Oh, it's really raining hard, Rose. Yeah. I bet you they call the game. You should go home. What, in this rain? Are you going home? What, are you kidding? No, I'm going to stick around just in case. I'll stay too, then. Well, far be it from me to tell you what to do. I'll be right back. All right, who thinks they're going to call the game? Come on, I got even money they call it. You like that, Richie? Huh? She got the kind of ass that would make a bishop kick out a stained glass window. She is so beautiful. You're a man of means now. You think you can get a broad like that? I don't think so, Marvin. Huh, yeah? You looking for a little more action? Sure. I'll bet you ten bucks you can't get her phone number. Ten bucks. I don't care what you do. I don't give a shit what you say. Ten bucks. You're on. Okay. Go get her, baby. You need any help, or... No, thanks. Can I... I mean, it's kind of wet, but... No, thanks, it's fine. No, thanks. I just left Joey standing there... Decker, check this out. I believe these two have a future. Like Gore and Lieberman. Hey, got a light? No. I'll bet you he scores. : A score bet? Sure. Even money, sawbuck, he doesn't have a chance. Even money? We're talking about Richie here. Ten to one. I'll take half of that. You got a light? You don't even know what they're betting on! Never you mind. I'm in. In? You're insane! You think he has any chance to...? Not even worth talking about. Okay, listen, if you see Joey, tell him I'm looking for him. Yeah, yeah. Hey, you got a light? Mmm... God bless you, you're a beautiful man. You're a real crime fighter. Come on out of there, you cowards! Execrable vermin! Here I am, Mr. Inevitable! Here I am, your fate is sealed! And your pain will be unbearable because you failed, failed, failed in your chosen field! Eagles suck! That's why you suck! When I was I kid I talked about playing ball. I dreamed about the major leagues, you know? Dad, I was a kid. I just liked playing baseball. And now it's not like I just want to be an artist. I am in love with jazz. You know, that music, my guys, my band. You know, I'm not a kid. It's who I am, it's what I do. Why are you so afraid of that? The numbers don't add up. It's a bad bet. Oh, this is coming from Mr. $2,000- on-a-Game-Bet? That's the point. That's just a game. Exactly, Dad, that's a game! I'm asking you to bet on me. Fascists! Come back here! Herb, look, I made egg salad for us. Rose, when you're at the ballpark you don't eat egg salad sandwiches. You eat hot dogs. I'm going to go get a hot dog. You want something? No, I've got egg salad, I guess. Did you make it with the celery? Yeah. I like it with the celery, but it's wrong. It's just wrong. Okay, don't tell me 'cause I'm really usually pretty good at this. Actress? And I teach Tae-bo. I could see that. Did you ever do one of those infomercials? No. I was up for one. I didn't get it though. That's ridiculous. Yeah. Probably 'cause I don't have an agent. Well, I could help you with that. I could. I mean, I talk to people all the time, you know? Maybe I could bring them to see you teach, or something like that. There's this girl who used to do this fitness show um, late night on the sports channel. She's now the new Isis, you know? And those girls in those aerobics competitions-- they're doing music videos and all that kind of stuff... I couldn't help you if my life depended on it, I'm sorry. That's okay. I... I actually do those aerobic competitions. Oh, that's great. Did you ever win? All I ever won was this home entertainment system. It's still in the middle of my living room floor. There's, like, wires everywhere. I don't know how to hook it up. Well, I could help you with that. No, that's okay. Like, stereo equipment is my hobby. I've hooked up all the people in my building. Really? Oh, yeah, there's a note on the bulletin board in the lobby that says if you want something hooked up, call... And I'm great with particle board furniture, too. I really, I'm... I would love to do that for you. Really? Yeah, I would. Thank you, that'd be great. Thank you. Sure. Well, good. You know, I should probably get your phone number because then I could call you... Sure. ...and we could just set up a time for me... Yeah. Do you have a pen or anything? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Pencil. Great. Marvin, have you seen Joey? You're on a real losing streak, Decker. First the Bruins, now your kid, huh? I got it, Marvin. Yeah, you got it. You're hot! All right, Decker, what was that, ten to one? Unbelievable. What was that? Well, your boy Decker here bet that you couldn't get Barbie's number. All right, there's ten for you and another ten for your sore cojones. You bet against me, Deck? What? It was just a bet. Yeah, but you bet against me. How come? Because I thought you couldn't. A lot of guys probably couldn't get her number. That was a bet? Oh, shit. You hand jobs were betting on me? And you, you little... Give me that! I'd rather throw the stereo out the frickin' window than have you anywhere near me! Honey, take it easy. You want to make a bet? How's this? A hundred bucks. You call me honey again and I'll kick you in the fucking balls. Get a grip, it was a friendly wager. Go ahead call me honey. Call me honey! : A hundred bucks! Go ahead, call me sweetie, honey, sugar baby, I don't care. You think I don't have the money? I got it right here! I'll kick you in the fucking balls. Shit. What's the matter? My wallet's gone. I hate you. I hate you! I hate both... all of you! Richie... You know what I think? Don't even talk about it. I'm just looking for my wallet. Oh, hi... I-I found a wallet. You did? Yeah, I-I have it here. Thank you. You're welcome. I didn't... Thank you. You're welcome. Are you okay? Yeah, um... Thank you. You've been very nice. What's wrong? Are you there? I'm here. It's just that... today was supposed to be the day. It was supposed to be my big chance. I mean, I made a deal with myself. It's going to sound so stupid... Do you have an umbrella? No. Oh, well, sit down. So... you made a deal with yourself. If I got on camera today... If the camera picked me out of the crowd... like Pamela Anderson. What happened with Pamela Anderson? She was at a football game... and she was beautiful and she was glamorous and... a cameraman was looking through the crowd and he picked her... a face on the big screen, and... Oh, it's like-it's like Lana Turner at Schwab's. Who? Lana Turner... it's not important. So if the camera picked you today, what? You know what... it doesn't matter. I think the universe is trying to tell me that... it's time to give up. And I've got to go. Oh. Well, it was nice to meet you, Miss...? Melody. Miss Melody. I-I'm Greg. Hi. You know, it's going to clear up soon-- I know it doesn't look like it-- a-and they're going to play ball again. Maybe you should stay. I can't stay. Why not? Because your friends made a bet on me... and... I kind of lost it. Yeah, that's what they do. Can you hold this just for a second? You know, that's how I met them. If you can believe it, th-they made a bet on me, too. : It was... they... I went to get a beer and they all switched seats and then they bet on-on how fast I would notice it. It was very embarrassing. Do you know why these guys sit up here in the bleachers every day? No. Torture... pure and simple. You know, this team has not won a World Series since 1908. A-And they haven't been in a World Series since 1945. It's... it's pathetic, really. Yeah. Hey, kid. You know C.P.R.? Yeah, why? Get up here, quick. What is it? Who needs C.P.R.? Get up here and I'll tell you. Come on, hurry up. Come on, you can go faster than that. Now watch your head. Watch your head. Come on in. Come on in. Look out. Look out. Now, you see this guy over here? He's about to have a heart attack. Watch this. Four. That's 12 in a row! 12 in a row. It's driving him nuts. Actually, it's not that big a deal to me and that's driving him nuts. Oh, right, yeah, yeah. He's dying inside. Victor, in the great scheme of things what does it really mean? Well, I'll tell you what it means, Billy. It means 12 in a goddamn row. And that ties the record. Your record. And now I'm going to break it. Yes, records are made to be broken. And I-I'll tell you something... I am pulling for you, buddy. I really hope you get it. Bullshit! Are you trying to do a number on my skull? If I wanted to do a mind job on you I could do a mind job on you. You ain't got the brains to do a mind job on me. Guys... Guys, uh... this is really thrilling but I think I'm just going to let you do your thing here. Thrilling? This is history! Oh, what's the matter, pal? Not enough about you? Can't stand not being the center of the universe? Come on, who invited who up here? Hey, hey, kid don't let him get to you. It's tough on his nerves going for the record. Yeah? Tough this. Hold up the sign. Hold it up. You know, the thing about a streak is that it makes you... forget... that there's a natural ebb and flow to the game. Yeah, a guy doesn't blow a save all year until the World Series. It's an eight. Who knows what kills a winning streak? Is it luck? Is it fate? Yeah? You got to respect the ebb and the flow. That's what makes the game new and different every day. Baltimore. Two in the fourth. Come on, I want to show you something. Look out there. What do you see? Empty field? Well, that's funny, because when I look out there I see Cap Anson knocking out his 3,000th hit. I see "Three-fingered" Mordecai Brown striking out the side. I see Tinkers to Evers to Chance. I'm sorry, guys it's just a rain delay to me. Here, just, t-take... take a... take another look. Take-take a good look. You remember that shot Clemente hit that one time? Oh, you should have seen that, kid. Went past here like a Scud missile. Ah, forget about it, Victor. He don't see nothing. Yeah. All right, well, thank you very much for coming. And that's as close as anybody's ever come to hitting the scoreboard. Roberto Clemente. He was such a great player. It's too bad he played for Pittsburgh. The Bruins haven't won a World Series since when? 1908. Hey, it's clearing up. How do you do that? Do what? See things. Oh, I just pay attention. Are you psychic? : I have been known to predict the future. Like what? Well, just today, for instance I predicted... that you would come back for your wallet. Come on, you know what I mean. And that you would stay for the whole game. So you really think the Bruins are going to win? No. I don't know. Absolutely. Well, we wouldn't want to miss that. Let me just get this straight. You lost $50 while the game was stopped because you bet that that boy couldn't get that girl's phone number? Look, just leave me alone, Rose. No, Zig, you got to give it a shot. Hey, Silkie, remember Cincinnati? Sorry. It's okay, Miss King. Don't worry about it. Enjoy the game. Have a nice seat. All right, it's a new ball game. Fortunately, same old Bruins. Aw, look at this. Where did you get all the cushions, you pussies? Hey, Richie, what did you pay for that cushion? Five dollars. Yeah? Here's a ten. Go get a hat. Greggy, who's leading off? Hale. Okay, Hale, we're due. Isn't this your lucky seat, though? Wherever I sit today is lucky. Darren Hale! Hale to the Chief! Let's go, Darren. Come on. Start it off. All right, Marvin just to show how wrong you are I'm offering a reach bet right out of the gate. Three to one this first guy gets on, double sawbuck. My three to your one, you got it. I'll take the same bet, Marvin. Hold on a second, honey. What are you betting? That our man is going to get on base? That's right, Rose. How much? 20 dollars. All right, all right. 'Cause I got a twenty here that says he's not going to make it. What the hell you doing, Rose? Anybody going to take it? 20 dollars. Now, put that money down. Put the money down. Richie, do you want to bet with me? You want to bet with me for $20? Uh-huh. Uh, for three to one? Whatever is the opposite of his. You're on. Okay, you're on. Hey, you lost your cherry. I did quite a long time ago, actually. What's the matter with you? Don't you see what you're doing? I'm betting one way with Marvin. You're betting the other way with this bum. You're canceling me out. Honey, somebody's got to protect our money. No, but you can't do that. Well, yes I can. I just did. Come on, Hale. I think it's $60. Are you happy, Rose? Are you happy? You see this, Rose? You see Marvin putting money in my hand. What are you doing? You're putting money in Richie's hand. What did you protect there? : MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP! Okay, it's homer time. We're climbing back in this one. This is our inning. It's time for the home run sign. Fingers in the air. Send the vibe to Manny. Hey. Hey. No. Don't slobber on it. Give us the ball. Arriba! Abajo! Al Centro! Para Dentro! Arriba! Abajo! Al Centro! Para Dentro! Arriba! Abajo! Al Centro! Para Dentro! Arriba! Abajo! Al Centro! Para Dentro! Arriba! Abajo! Al Centro! Para Dentro! Did you hear that, Marvin? It's all going to hell for you! You're going down. The sweat is pouring down your brow! Did you hear that? That's the sound of the home field advantage! All I hear is 35,000 people about to get their hearts broken. It's over! Next up for the Bruins, Jesus Corrales. We love you, Corrales! .471 slugging percentage when he takes the first pitch. Really? This year. Strike? You tub of lard! Were you blind from birth? No, actually. Safe! Nice play, Keough! I got furniture can jump higher than you. You heard me. Your party is over. They're pulling their pitcher. Oh, it don't matter who's pitching. Now it's a matter of destiny. Take a shower, butthead, 'cause you stink! Destiny, Zig? I bet they don't score another run. Well, but man on second, and nobody out? How much? Let's go 50 bucks. You're on. I hate to do it, but I'm with Marvin and I got 50 bucks that says they don't score. Rose! How about it, Richie? Do you want to bet? I don't know. Who's the new pitcher, Greg? Anatoni. Is he any good? I don't know. He has a 5.41 ERA, and he hangs his curve ball. You're on. Who's that? Who said that? I said that. I'm Greg. I'm Rupert. What's happening out there? They pulled the starting pitcher and the new guy's not that great, according to Rupert. Now pitching for the Eagles number 47, Rick Anatoni. Come on, buddy, let's go. Come on. : Oh. Oh! That's the worse bunt I've ever seen. Any player that can't lay down a sacrifice should be shot and fined. All right, all right. Two away. We can still get it going. Ozu will get us going. What, are you kidding? He's like one for his last 30. He's making the Mendoza line look good. Mendoza line? Mario Mendoza was a shortstop in the '70s and '80s. He batted .200 in the National League Championship Series. Which is not good. I thought it was the '60s, '70s, and '80s. No, '70s and '80s I think he started in 1968. That's what I thought. When you cross the Mendoza line you bat over .200... The Mendoza line is not .200. It's a floating line. It's whatever that fellow is hitting. Who gives a shit? He's dead. He's not dead. Even if he's dead, he's not dead. There will always be a Mendoza line. And there will always be people who will never be able to cross it. And that'll be Ozu. Oh, man! One for the team. Hey, there's more than one way to skin a cat, hey, Marvin, huh? Next batter, the catcher, Scott Sheffield. : Sheff! Sheff! Sheff! Sheff... Let's go, Scotty! Listen... we can help Sheffield out there. Devious but effective. Take these. Use these on every pitch. Keough won't hear the crack of the bat. He'll get a lousy jump on the ball. Oh, yeah. Okay, all right, I'm in. Hey, you can't do that. No, I want that one. No, I... Just exchange them. Okay, here. All right, okay, fine. When I drop my arm. What's your problem?! ♪ Humiliation, humiliation ♪ ♪ You will never find the ball ♪ Look. You got help. You'll always need help. All of your life. Go, go, go! It's too late. Inside-the-park homer. You're putrid, Keough! You give garbage a bad name! Nice! You all did very well. Give me back the noisemakers. Yeah! Oh-ho. Very well done. Thanks for that. Very well done. There's the chicken. Hey, Marvin... Now batting, the pitcher... Wow! That's a hell of a system you got there, Rose. You think they got a chance? Oh, anything's possible. Yeah! New ball game. Four-four. Now batting for the Eagles... Man, I thought I hated this guy, Keough. You're brutal. Oh, you want to see brutal? When that bum Keough comes back out here I'm going to make him climb the vines. Yeah, to wring your neck, you whack job. He doesn't believe me. You can do this? You can get that busher to climb the vines? Hey, you want to make a bet on that, Decker? Oh, wait a second there, Marvin. I'm consulting. Look me in the eye. Tell me he'll climb the vines. Like Cheetah going for a banana. 50 bucks he climbs. Oh, you're in the book. And you talk to me about stupid bets? Oh, come on, come on. Let's go. One pitch wonder. Very nice. Next batter, Chico Gonzalez. He's no hitter! Come on, you got him! Come on now! Yeah! Two pitches, two outs. This is fantastic. Way to go! Hey, Decker, where's your son? He'll be back. Want to make a bet on that? He'll be back. C-note says he's long gone. You're covered. Next batter, Silvio Rodriguez. Oh, man. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Anybody want anything? What do I want from the bathroom? Here he comes. Leading off for the Bruins center fielder Sammy Barnes. Hey, Keough. Hey, farm boy! Dr. Blumwasser is looking for you. When are you going to pay him that six grand you owe him? Those steroids aren't free, you know. Hey, six grand, you deadbeat. All for a little muscle tone you could have got with some hard work. You cheap sandlot hillbilly. Is that true? Oh, it's all true. Hey, farm boy! He hates that name. How do you know he hates that name? Well, I got to come to the ball yard as prepared as the players-- I listen to the radio. So do I listen to the radio. Well, that's good, but I got satellite-- All right, all right. I use satellite hookups, so I got 74 sports talk radio shows. Next batter, Dayton Green. Mean Green! Mean Green! I read the roster books, Bill James Who's Who in Baseball. No, not you, scumbag. You rate two chapters of Who Sucks in Baseball. Plus, I got farm boy's TRW off the Internet. You wouldn't believe this kid's credit rating. It's unbelievable. Go, go, go. Slide! Slide! See that? That's called baseball. He was out. Safe by five feet. Way to go. Hey, Keough! The steroids aren't working. Get your money back. The only thing that got bigger is your ass! Hail to the Chief. Holy shit, he's looking back, Marv. Come on, we got to double that bet. I'm not betting any more this inning. I'm watching the fucking game. Ooh, now he's watching the game. The fucking game. Whoa, here it comes. It's your moment. This is it. Your life isn't worth living! Way to go, Keough. I hear you're being traded for a case of Gatorade. And a batboy to be named later. You bush-league bum! Hey, how's Ruthie? All together now: How's Ruthie? One... two... Leave him alone. ...three. How's Ruthie? Who's Ruthie? Oh, come on, you know. Little redheaded Ruthie, back in your hotel room. Pick it up, asshole. Throw home! Oh, yeah! Go back to Ruthie, you fat ass. She's waiting for you back at the hotel. What'd you do? Leave her tied to the bed? Maybe I can recommend a lawyer for you 'Cause I hear your mother-in-law's coming in from Tucson. Even she knows about Ruthie. And you thought nobody was going to find out. Hell, your wife, Bonnie, knows. Your next-door neighbors, the Finkels, know. Oh! Your dog, Muffy, knows. I know, we all know. What do we know? That Ruthie's got the... Ruthie's got the... Ruthie's got the... Rowland's got the... Your mama's got the... Your mama's got the... Come on, baby, come on, baby. Come on, you fucker, huh? Like a cheetah, Keough, like a monkey. Oh, God! Look what they did to the foliage. Go back to St. Louis. You bastard. Yeah! Beautiful. Ruthie, Ruthie... Unbelievable. Okay, Marvin, that's 50 bucks. This isn't baseball. It's a fucking circus. Here you go, my friend. You earned it. No, no, that one's on me. Well, you know, strange things can happen when we play St. Louis, Marvin. Back in '57, there were two balls on the field. I remember that, but that was '59, not '57, remember? Yeah, right. Remember when Pulaski hit that umpire with the throw from center field? Not Pulaski, Clark. Yeah, hit him right in the head. No, he hit him in the rear end. Well, maybe his head was up his ass 'cause I know where he hit him. Do you want to bet? With her, I don't bet. What? Just 'cause I don't like the betting doesn't mean I don't like the game. All right, let's do something. Oh, double play! Did you see that, Blinky? No. What is your problem? Oh, wait, don't tell me you're buying that blind crap, huh? He's been staring at your tits for six innings. You could do Shakespeare off that balcony. Am I right? Next batter, Harry Washington. What? You're not going to kick me in the balls, are you? Oh, it's a possibility. Ooh... It's all right, we drew blood. You did good. It's a run, baby! What a performance. I couldn't do nothing without him. All right, come on. Joey, I thought you left. No, I was just getting some beer. Oh. Bad news for Marvin. What do you mean? Dad put a c-note on you coming back. A c-note? And Marvin bet against me, did he? Okay, you know, you can do me a fucking favor, okay? You go back in there, and you tell Marvin that he just won himself $100. All right? You do that for me? Yeah. Thanks. Next batter, right fielder Rowland Keough. : Ke-ogh, A-hole. : Ke-ogh, A-hole. : Ke-ogh, A-hole. Ke-ogh... A-hole? What else? That's inspired. Ke-ogh, A-hole, Ke-ogh, A-hole Ke-ogh, A-hole, Ke-ogh, A-hole... Quiet, people! Time out! Ke-ogh... Listen to that. Isn't that beautiful? Look what you started. We started. Ke-ogh... Keough, 30,000 people think you suck! Ke-ogh, A-hole... Check this out. Oh, Jesus. Oh, you have no scruples. I admire that in a man. All right, listen, first of all that is illegal, and you can't just... But I must. And I shall. Bravo! Well, at least we're done with that guy. That's right, we are. Hey, you! Let's go. Officer, this man was personally responsible for the Bruins' rally. Am I right? And if he goes, I go. Fine with me. You, too. Oh, shit. Then I go, too. Me, too. Me, too. Officer, take her. Take them all. Yes, yes, yes. All right, all right. I'm clearing the section. No. No! I'll go quietly. I shall return. Keep the faith. Never give up. We're number one. I love you all. We love you. You're the best. We few. We happy few. We band of brothers. Never put pineapples in Jell-O. Ich bin ein Bruin. You're out of your fricking mind you Commie bastard! I am the walrus. Eagles suck! Come up with a new cheer after they let you out of prison. All right, let's go. Two down, two down. Let's put an end to these guys... a stake in the heart. Just hit one ground ball. Got you a beer, Marv. Great. We're still down four to seven? What "we"? The Eagles are still three down, yes, for now. Hey, Deck, I saw Joey. Great. He was leaving. Guess that means you won, Marv. Oh, what is it with kids today? I tell you, they got no respect. God love them. I'll never get it. All right, I smell a two-out rally right now. And I'm looking for a score bet. Okay, the Eagles are coming back in this inning right here. I'm saying 100 bucks and you got to give me three to one. Anybody? There's two outs, for Christ's sakes. All right, I got to get two to one. At least two to one. You really think the Eagles are going to score? Yeah. Yes, I do. One hundred bucks. You give me two to one. Oh, that's, that's too rich for me. Too rich? There's already two down. I'm looking for... $100 even money. This inning? Yes. Even money? What? Am I speaking fucking Portuguese here? I'll give you 20 bucks. Seventy-five. Uh... 50. I got $50 says the Eagles will score. Even money? You got it. Rose, again, every time? Can't you just let me bet by myself? I'll take a piece of that. Deck, I thought you were my friend. You are my friend, but she's betting against the Bruins. I can't help myself. Besides, if it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me. Rose, don't you get it? You're betting $50. I'm betting $50. I can't win with you, you can't win with me. Why don't you just take my bet? All right, I will take your bet. You're on. Rose, Rose... please. Please, please, please, stop this. What do you want from me? I want you to keep your promise. I want to know when you come home at night whether your pockets are going to be empty or full. What about you? What about all that crap that you buy? That crap is an investment in our future. Yeah, it's an investment in the flea market which is the only place you're ever going to sell those stupid statues. The figurines are collectibles. Right now, I could sell any number of them for over 1,000 bucks apiece. Oh, sure, and the Bruins are going to go to the World Series. Listen to me, Zig. I would personally take a ballpeen hammer and smash up each one of those collectibles if you'd just tell me that you'll quite gambling. No more betting. Not on the Bulls. Not on the Bears. Not on the Bruins. Not on the Blackhawks. Don't be stupid. I mean, some of those figurines are worth 1,000 bucks. Yeah, and you're going to blow it all betting on the Bruins. Excuse me. Oh, sorry. Rose? Rose! Thanks for making the ball game so much fun. Yeah, you're welcome. What? What? I mean, come on. Did you hear her? She wants me to stop betting. Deck... stop betting? : Charge! That's why I'll never remarry. They're all a pain in the ass. Pain in the ass, right? You don't know the first thing about it. Marvin, you owe me money. Now let's all rise for the seventh inning stretch and the singing of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame." : ♪ Take me out to the ballgame ♪ ♪ Take me out with the crowd ♪ ♪ Buy me some peanuts and Crackerjacks ♪ ♪ I don't care if I ever get back ♪ ♪ 'Cause it's root, root, root for the home team ♪ ♪ If they don't win it's a shame ♪ ♪ 'Cause it's one, two, three strikes you're out ♪ ♪ At the old ballgame ♪ : ♪ Take me out to the ballgame ♪ ♪ Take me out to the crowd ♪ ♪ Buy me some peanuts and Crackerjacks ♪ ♪ I don't care if I never come back. ♪ Rose! If you go out, you can't come back in. Rose, come back. Look, she-she's upset, let her back in. There's no reentry. Ah, man, everybody's a hustler. That's for the both of us. Yeah, enjoy. Rose, wait. I'm a grown man. I just didn't want you telling me what I could and couldn't do. I didn't know what else to do. Well, did you have to do it in front of the guys? Did you have to lie to me? Look, I didn't... I-I.... I was just... I'm sorry. I just thought, you know we could have a good time... together. Why don't you come inside, huh? Please. You really want me to? I'm thinking... just thinking. Yes, Rose that's what I really want. Just a minute, Rose. Hey, Joey! Where you going? The Bruins just went ahead. Great. I hope you win a bundle. Your dad was hoping that you'd come back. Yeah, I know. I heard all about it. It cost him a c-note, right? Aah, your father only bets on what he believe in. You ought to take that as a compliment. I hope to see you again, real soon. Ladies and gentlemen the official paid attendance for today's game is... 31,626. Damn it. Under 33. Good call, Richie. Keep it. You'll need it. You're out! I was safe! I was safe! I was safe! Hey, how would you like to be my color man? Your what? My color man. That's the guy who describes the action on the field. No... Why? No, no, it's easy. All you do is just say what you see. This thing is killing my ear. Just, like for instance, what did you just see? Uh, a guy caught the ball threw it to another guy who caught the ball. Okay... Malone grounds one into the hole Green scoops it up, steps on the bag fires to Hale... double play. See now, your version was a little bit more exciting. We'll work on it. We'll work on it. It'll be good. As we head into the bottom of the eighth, the score is... Uh... Bruins seven, Eagles four. Hey, guys. Bruins still up seven to four? Yeah. Still married? Welcome back. Oh, Marvin. What? What? You couldn't watch the game at home? Oh, Marvin... I believe you owe me some money from the last inning. Uh, 50 bucks. You see, Marvin, much like a reach/no-reach bet you should never give even money on a score bet when there's two away. You know what I'm saying? Look, 50 samoleans, Rose. Oh. Let's go, Sheff! Come on, babe! Come on, Scotty! That's all right. You've been doing great for us all day. Hang in there. Don't worry about it. Tell me. Oh, uh, Sheffield... he hit it way up in the sky... He pops it up. Sheffield the magnificent. Okay. Sheffield the magnificent um, popped it up and it was out, so... Perfect. Okay. One away. One away. Oh... I made this bet with you, didn't I? Yes, you did. Yeah. There you go. Thank you. I-I thought... I know what you thought but, you see, in this case... Come on, Kyle! : Go Bruins! This is the point. Boo... This is what I was saying earlier. Now batting for the Bruins, Sammy Barnes. So, what happened? Tell me what happened. Oh, um, um, Riddick hit it right along the, uh, dirt there. Grounds to... Riddick grounds along... To who? I-I don't know, the base... The guy just got him out at the base, so... Okay... Two away! Stressful. Yeah, we're doing good, though. I hate this job. Come on, Sammy. Come on, Sam. Joey! Hey, Dad, what did I miss? Inside-the-park home run by Sheffield the magnificent. Marvin. I need two. Two what? You thought I lost. I already paid you. It's an honest mistake. Good bet? Uh... sure thing. Aah... God, God, he just... What? The guy between second and third there... Shortstop. ...uh, shortstop, just beat him to the base. By an eyelash! Beautiful. Yeah. And that retires the side... Right. Third out. ...by an eyelash. That's nice. Three more outs. Okay, three more outs. Three more outs. Three more outs! Three more outs. : Three more outs. Three more outs. Three more outs. Three more outs. Three more outs. Rose. Uh, honey, I-I know I made you a promise about, uh, no more betting but, uh, I got one other small bet, and I... I can try to get it canceled, I guess, but, uh... What's the bet? Well, um... i-it's a game bet with Marvin. It's 100 bucks on the Bruins. You bet 100 bucks on the Bruins? Yeah, I-I know. I just had a feeling today... It's the ninth inning... they're ahead by three. Yeah, I-I should have... Oh, double the bet, honey. Lay him odds. Safe! He was out by three feet! He was out! You got a rally here, Decker. One man on isn't exactly a rally, Marvin. We'll see. Hey, Marv. How about doubling our bet? Way to go, Eagles! Yeah, yeah. He ain't going for it, Rose. He knows when he's well off. Aw, come on, Marvin. Where's those big balls we've been hearing about all day? Aah, he's all talk. No balls. No balls. Shit! Yes! All right. All right, two men on no outs and the tying run at home plate Sounds like a rally to me. You bet your ass it's a rally. Greg, Greg. We need one of your special scoop, step on the bag, fire... Double plays. ...double plays-- that's what we need. Hey, hey, what do you say, we need a double play. Hey, hey, what do you say, we need a double play. : Hey, hey, what do you say, we need a double play. Hey, hey, what do you say, we need a double play. Hey, hey, what do you say, we need a double play. Hey, hey, what do you say... A reach bet for the band. No sense paying interest to the bank. Hey, hey, what do you say, we need a double play. Hey, hey, what do you say, we need a double play. Hey, hey, what do you say, we need a double play. And that's ball three to McGuinn. Oh, goddamn it! I can't see anything. Sit down and shut up! Get a technician in here. Now! Ball four to McGuinn and that loads the bases... Oh, you piece of shit! Show me something! You tubeless motherfucker! You piece of shit! Hey, hey... All right, all right, listen, I'm fine. Listen, listen to me. It's the top of the ninth. The bases are loaded, there's nobody out... Listen to me! They're my people. They need me. Hey, hey, hey! Bases loaded. How could he walk him on four pitches? 70 homers, that's how. Hey, Zig, you still want to double that bet? How about you, Rose? Weren't you having a conversation about somebody's balls? Who's that little guy there, climbing the, uh what's it called, pitcher's hill? The mound. That's Reid, the manager. They're changing pitchers. That's it for Riddick. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a change in the lineup. Now pitching for the Bruins number 41, Todd Heck. He's terrific. He's had 20-something saves already this season. Twenty-six. Wow, what's his ERA? It's excellent-- it's under two. Under two. Okay, Marvin, you're on. Okay, we'll double it, Marvin. You're down. Ladies and gentlemen now pinch-hitting for Tito Gonzalez number 51, Jerry Cavanaugh. Cavanaugh replacing Gonzalez? They're both righties. Heck throws right. The Eagles are idiots. Don't call them idiots. Maybe he's a good righty righty hitter. Cavanaugh? Maybe. Against Heck? They're idiots. They're idiots! Fucking idiots. He's on today. Oh, he's on every day. Come on, Todd. Come on, Todd, baby. Hey, hey, did you see that fork ball? That's not a fork ball. That's a split- fingered fastball. Well, it's against a right-hander it could be a screwball. Ha, ha. That is one very big out! That's just one. The bases are still loaded. Ah, shut up, Richie. Well, it is. The bases... Let me go! They're in trouble! They need me! Strike one! Oh, yeah, he did. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, this is kind of nerve-racking. Come on, babe. Shh, shh... Come on, I'm just trying to say... Shh, shh. Look, Deck... Shh, Zig... Herb, Herb... Shh... Let's see what you've got. Oh, once. come on. Throw it in there. Strike! Watch the damn ball! I don't believe this. I do not believe this guy! I'm done, I'm done. I-I can't take it. He's no hitter. Come on, get him! Strike three! You're out! Six straight strikes! Six straight strikes! Six straight strikes! Six straight strikes! Six straight strikes! Six straight strikes! Six pitches, six pitches, six pitches. Sit down, sit down, sit down. That's enough, that's enough. You crazy, crazy man. All right, here we go. Mr. D, Mr. D, give me some! Next batter, Rowland Keough. : Ke-ogh, A-hole! Ke-ogh, A-hole! Haven't we heard this? Keough, you bum! Do you know how sick I am of seeing your saggy steroid ass all day? You suck! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Get up there, Greggy! Watch what you're doing. Way to go, Greggy. All right, okay, that's okay. Strike! Strike one, strike one. All right, we're shutting them down now. Zig, no, that's bad luck. Shake your head three times, lift your arm and spit over your right shoulder. Oh, Jesus, sorry. He's the best pitcher in the National League. Oh, I can't say that. Let's see what you got. Show me what you got. Come on, come on, come on. Oh! Another ball. Just another ball. That's okay, honey. As long as he strikes him out, I don't care how he does it. All right, me, too. Whoo! Here we go, here we go, here we go. Throw strikes, throw strikes. Oh! It's the dirt ball. He threw it right into the dirt. That's okay, that's okay, he does that all the time. Wait, wait, wait, if he threw it into the dirt, where's the ball? It's okay, it's... The catcher's got it. Everything is fine. Come on, baby, no walks, no walks! He's cracking. He can't take the pressure. Oh, you wish. He thrives on the pressure. He's building the count on purpose. Bullshit. Full count, full count. 3 and 2. We got him. One more and we can go home. Tell me, is he going for the little bag at the bottom of his feet? Who? The pitcher. No. Good. Yeah, he is. Right now he is. He's nervous. It's coming back here, it's coming back here. Throw it back! Throw it back! Throw it back! Throw it back! No, no, no, I caught this! We could win the game on this ball, me and you, Marvin. Sorry. This is a wool blend, you fucking moron. Sorry. Sorry? How's that? Huh? What do you think, just 'cause you get us a couple of beers we're fucking asshole buddies now? Marvin! You stay out of this, Decker. Let me tell you something, Richie you don't even fucking rate up here, you understand? You're invisible. We can barely tolerate you. See, nobody has the balls to tell you that but I got the balls to tell you you're a fucking orphan. Throw it back, you twerp! All right, Zig, do we double that bet or what? Yeah, that's right. Christmas in July. I'll take a piece of that, Marvin. Even money on the Bruins. Oh, yeah, Richie? What do you want to go? A thousand dollars? Hello? Can't cover that? How about $500? Too much? How about $250? I mean, any mama's boy scumbag can cover $250. Give him odds. Deck... No, no. Come on, Marvin, how much money you make today? You're up a run, the game's almost over give the fucking kid some odds. Deck! $250, Marvin-- even money. You're on. Attaboy, Richie. All right, come on, Todd, let's go. Here we go, Heck, come on, now. Come on, Todd. One more out, one more out. Shake it off. Never happened. You can do this, you can do this. Okay, there's a weak pop-up to the left side for the third out. He retires the side, but the damage is done. Uh, what's... Keough, his grand slam has put the Eagles ahead 8-7 and going into the bottom of the ninth the Bruins need one to tie and two to win. Like you've been doing it all your life. All right, now it's our turn. Here's the scorecard. Who's leading off, Richie? Green. Green! That's perfect! That's what we want! Top of the order. We got these guys where we want them. Come on, this is fantastic. Now batting, Dayton Green. : Mean Green! Mean Green! We want a hit! We want a hit! We want a hit! We want a hit! Okay, Green grounds to second for the first out. That's okay, we got two left. We can still win. Has that happened before? Rarely. Next batter, Darren Hale. That was just instinct! That wasn't skill. One more out, girls. Oh, shut up, Marvin! Oh, shut up, Marvin! What'd I do? Next up for the Bruins, Manny Losa! : MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP! That's the eye, Manny! Wait for the one you want! Okay, Rosie! Arriba, abajo, al centro, para dentro : arriba, abajo, al centro, para dentro arriba, abajo, al centro, para dentro arriba, abajo, al centro, para dentro arriba, abajo, al centro, para dentro arriba, abajo, al centro, para dentro. Oh, my God. It's gonna make it! And the mighty Bruins lose again. Go home, you lucky bastard. Ladies and gentlemen, the final score is St. Louis 8, the Chicago Bruins 7. We invite you to join us again tomorrow when the Chicago Bruins will play the St. Louis Eagles. Thank you for joining us and have a good evening. Marvin, let me tell you something. It's been a freaking delight spending the afternoon with you. What is it? Three Cs? There you go. See, I'm not worried about losing to you because tonight I'm taking my bride to the House of Sweden. Well, the way things are looking I'll probably have to take you to the House of Sweden. See? I'm a winner. Greggy, see you tomorrow. I'll see you. Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow. Miss King... we'll see you tomorrow. Deck, Joey, it's great to have you back. Richie... ...see you tomorrow. Ah, I don't know about you, Decker. You know what your problem is? You're a heart bettor. You bet with your heart and not your grape. What can I tell you? These guys are nothing but a bunch of choke artists. I don't know anybody that ever went broke betting against the Bruins after the Fourth of July. You can bet your ass on that. They're just such... such fucking heart-breakers, you know? They... they suck the life right out of you. Springtime wonders. I'm surprised at you, Decker. I'm surprised at me, too. My marker. Plenty of bets left in the season. I'll always be here for you. I know you will. Come on, Joe. All right, Richie, I believe you owe me $250. You don't have it, do you? I don't have it all with me. I got $50. You-you don't have it all with you but you got $50. What am I going to do with $50? Richie, don't you know that you don't make bets you can't cover? Here, Richie. Whoa, whoa, what, are you his attorney? Joey... Not you, too, huh? Runs in the family, huh? Hello? What, I got to hit you over the head? Let's get out of here. Need a ride? No. I can hear it. How about you, Greggy? God knows you need a ride. Hey, how much money you win today, Marvin? I don't know. I did pretty good. I made a lot of money today. Well, if you're smart tomorrow you'll bet it all on the Bruins because tomorrow they're going to win, Marv because they're mad now and when they're mad, they get up and they get even, and they're not only going to win tomorrow they're going to win the rest of the series then they're going to take three from Montreal, four from San Francisco. They're going to have the best season since 1945. They're going to take the division, the pennant and then they'll be in the Series, Marv. Marvin, can you see it? The World Series! And it's going to go seven games and in the seventh game it's going to be all tied up in a pitchers' duel that goes into the 23rd inning nothing, nothing and then you know what happens? No. They bring Ernie Banks out of retirement and he hits a home run right into my lap to win the game. And then they'll be World Champions, Marv. Champions of the world. And that's when you can give me a ride home. Right now you're going to walk me to the El. Right now I'm going to walk Melody to the El. Hey, do you have a...? These things happen, buddy. I don't care. Well, maybe they'll win again next week. I don't care. They won last week. Richie! I'll be right there. Maybe they'll even win tomorrow. I don't care. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? No. You sure? Hmm? So guess what? What? I got up inside the scoreboard. When? During the rain delay. You're kidding. And? They got broads up there. Get out of here.
