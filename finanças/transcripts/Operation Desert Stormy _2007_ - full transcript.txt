[♪ Tango music ] [♪ Por una cabeza ] Congratulations on becoming agent Rachel. I knew you had it in you. Unfortunate about your husband though. Yes. Well, I could not let my feelings for George compromise the mission. Oh... Sorry. Sorry! Sorry... Nice tits. Does your husband appreciate these? No... Husband doesn't appreciate anything. Bull! Dead fool. Ah, George never does that. George couldn't even make coffee. Oh God Agent X, That's what a real fucking secret-agent dick feels like. Yeah. - You can't teach that on training. - No. I don't need that anymore. George never makes me come. George is a fool. No evidence. Mission complete. - Ah! (- Ah) - Ah! - Ah! Jesus Christ. George you scared the crap out of me. Yeah? You should see it from my point of view. Dreamed about that damn fish tank again? Yeah. Something like that. Thank you. Oh I have my cereal. Oh you think so? Yeah. I do. You feeling lucky? Would you try to come take it? Oh, I will. You call yourself a secret agent, no wonder they won't give you a promotion. Argh. Holly bitch. Hey honey, I was thinking we could ride in together. I take it as a "no". Ladies first. Age before beauty. Brains before stupidity. What I meant was you're the stupid one, ok? (- Idiot) (I'm the smart one. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT) I meet you up-- Everybody knows that. No. Oh... Oh no. Oh yeah, you want some of this. [composing phone number] [phone rings] I spank you like a red-headed stepchild. Oh no you didn't! Can't believe you stick my spot. Oh, is this your spot? You're dirty. You're dirty. Damn it. (Hi Rachel) Morning fellows. (Good morning) I made brownies! Who wants some? You don't have to do that. I had to park 4 blocks away. Well. Now you've had your cardio. Those are the last of the brownies, isn't it? I didn't even get one. Oh, honey... You've to watch your girlish figure. It's not fair Rachel. You know I wanted a brownie. George, life's not fair. That's one hell of a woman. One hell of a good cook. Yeah, well you try being married to her for 6 years. Rachel: SEVEN! I'm sorry the lack of sex is making my memory blurry. [beep] Sorry you got to remove all metal from your pockets. [beep] All metal. [beep] Looks like we're gonna be a little more thorough. Ah! Sam, it's time for a deep body cavity search. Agent X: So there I was... ...surrounded by the enemy... ...deep in the jungles of Bolivia... ...unarmed and then suddenly I... Agent Z? Yes Sir. You're late. Yes Sir, there was a malfunction at security. I apologize Sir. - Malfunction...? - Yeah. I'll tell you what though... I've got a big mission for you. What? (Yes Sir) Go down to the break room and give me a cup of coffee. [laughs] You know how I like it. As I was saying, bullets buzzing over my head. I had no weapon. Suddenly, from the canopy above, came the enemy: *zeeee*. - Hi! - Argh! Oh... Hi Amy. Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. No, it's okay, it's a... I'm a little on edge. Too much caffeine. Well, I must compliment you on your cat-like reflexes. Oh... Yeah, I was... uh... Comes with being a secret agent. I'll have to be a little bit more careful around you. I didn't know you could be so... dangerous. Yeah, that's... that's me: dangerous you know. You could... lose an eye. [laughs] Hmm... Speaking of danger, I have something to show you. Won't you come in? How... cool! (Wow) [amazed laughs] This is cool! What does this do? Oh, be careful with that, I'm having a lot of problems with it. [George's smelling] It contains nerve gas, but it keeps leaking. A mini supercomputer. Complete. With wireless internet. Digital camera. MP3 player. Cigarette lighter. Even an AM/FM radio. Can I have it? No. What's this? Hum... That's... That's... That's my vibrator. So you're planning on doing a little fly-fishing? Oh that? That is my pride and joy. It's impenetrable. Watch. [gunshot] Wow! You're crazy. Watch this. [sound of arrow] Okay, I get it. This vest is specially designed. to increase the adrenaline and testosterone of its wearer. Giving him more strength, endurance. Even enabling him to run faster. Well you think he could've made it a little bit more fashionable. I mean it looks like a fishing vest. Do I look like I know anything about fashion? Oh..! No no no, you know... No, the vest works. It's um... You know it's just got lots of... ...convenient pockets. It has an internal cooling system. that regulates body temperature and increases stamina. Imagine what that could do for you under fire. Just think what it could do for me in the bedroom. I already have. George: [um-um] This is my latest invention: Training goggles. It can create virtually any situation imaginable. Really? From flying to combat. Try. (Okay) Wow. That's cool. You do anything? Anything. - Anything? - Anything. You want to ***. You don't know how long it's been. Oh god you're naughty. Oh yes George take it. You know you've always wanted that tight little fucking ass of mine. Alright in that tight fucking ass? Okay, that was a little weird. You don't know how long I've waited for that. You tricked me!? You lured me down here to take advantage of me. You... you gadget siren. Oh... So...? Oh come on you know I like you. I'm married, I feel so violated. It wasn't real. Felt real! Don't! Don't touch me! Predator. [Rachel's smelling] - Where have you been? - Huh? What? You've been gone over an hour. X was looking for you. He was? Yeah. He needed his coffee. Oh, yeah, right. So? - So what? Rachel: So where were you? I was taking care of business in the lab. Business, huh? And was this "business" wearing a white lab coat. and reeking a fake designer perfume? What are you talking about? Don't play stupid with me, George. That little trollop, Amy. What about her? George I'm serious. I know that you know that she knows that we're... having marital issues. She's like a vulture waiting on the wings. You're a crazy Lady. Haha. I'm crazy? I'M CRAZY? I'm not the one was provoked by a glass of milk this morning I'm not the one that hassled the security guards, and we won't even discuss your bouts of mourning road rage WHAT?? I did not harass those security guards you set me up, and for your information they proceeded to get very intimate with me I guess I should be grateful because it's the closest thing I'm head to sex in months There you go again, always with the sex We know what George? Maybe if you learn a little technique instead of humping me like a drunken Chihuahua I would be a little more willing to participate - Really? - Yeah! Really? Is there a problem here? Together: NO SIR Good Rachel, I would like to see you alone, please Absolutely - Z? - Yes? - Where's my coffee? - Coming up, Sir "Where's my coffee?" Rachel, have a seat I am sitting, Sir Right Rachel... I need you. Excuse me? Your help. Oh You're the only one that I can trust.

Don't cry It's the terrorists The Middle Eastern ones You know... those guys... mm-hmm They've developed a plan to destroy the world and I have to go and steal the magic ingredients to the weapon (Ah... weapons) - Rachel? - Yes, Sir?

Yes, Sir Good Here's what I need for you to do Take this cellphone, guard it with your life I'm going to be meeting my contacts and they are very dangerous men and they are going to want to know that I am who I say I am Do you understand? Not really, Sir Gonna take me into custody They're gonna dial that phone for a code If you don't give him that code, or you don't answer that phone I'll be killed Now you understand? Rachel: Huh...

That's the oldest trick in the book He just wants to fuck you You're jealous Jealous that I got a mission You are a secretary No one's gonna give you a mission I am an administrative assistant but I guess you know a thing or two about not getting missions now, wouldn't you? Well, except fetching coffee Now why would you have to go there, okay? I was just trying to warn you, he's trying to get in your pants. All he'd to do is ask. What did you say? I said don't be such an ass [sigh] What is it with you and that fish tank anyway? This is going to be the perfect underwater ecosystem And I will be its God You are not right Yeah Well at least I'm not waiting by a phone that's never going to ring It will ring Why don't you have a little faith that he'll accomplish the mission? You just don't get it He's not on a secret mission Nobody knows anything about a secret mission That's because it's secret, duh! Honey, you know nothing of protocol You really think he would tell a secretary about a secret mission? I am an administrative assistant! Let me see if I get this straight: The story is there's a group of terrorists and they've built a bomb and they've threatened to blow up the planet Earth But alas this will be his last call of duty And his fate rests squarely in palms of your hands You're the only one he can trust His last hope Bla bla bla bla bla bla Rachel: Huh George: Yeah Listen, that's a story he gave his last secretary Rachel, listen, don't get mad [tazzer sound] George: Aargh!

Do not make me tazz you twice in the same night Okay [tazzer sound] I am an administrative assistant! [tazzer sound] [George cries] She's crazy Jesus, who are you, for God sake I think I just found heaven. What do you think of this little swine? Isn't it cute?

Here ...that does not work anymore. Thank you captain Obvious Oh. Oh! Oh my god. Do you think he's dead? No [Indistinct chatting] Good morning everyone, I am agent J from the Washington field office I'm afraid I have some terrible news One of ours is missing. Agent X has disappeared All we know is he left for an unknown destination (and has not been heard of since Friday afternoon) [Rachel's speaking to George] All communication attempts have failed and we are forced to use all of our resources at hand [Rachel starts crying] (The search and rescue...) She's really upset, sorry You shut your hole. - We can't leave him-- - Rachel, listen! Okay! Rachel, you need to get yourself together Did you hear them? - Shhh! - Terrorist! What if they bomb the United States? What if they find out I'm responsible? - I DON'T WANT TO BA A TRAITOR! - Rachel! Rachel! - Get yourself together - Ouch Ouch! Rachel, listen! Did anybody else hear your conversation that you had with X? - No - Okay, good Now we're gonna march back in there and we're gonna act as if we know nothing, okay? I don't want to go back... Hey hey hey, you want to be brought up in treason charges? No? Have you ever been to prison? Okay Now we're gonna go back in there we're gonna act as if we know nothing until I come up with a plan You got that? Shake your head yes that you got it. Good. Now let's go. Rachel! This way! Rachel. [Indistinct chatting] (Get yourself together...) No no no Yes, this is where the best place to catch crab is. [Indistinct chatting] Yeah, give that [Rachel coughs] ...toast. You need to get yourself together. Do you understand me? Sit down. Sit - Act normal, keep it together, yes. - You understand? Keep it together. - Rachel isn't it? - Maybe May I have a word with you in private Hey you! Bring me a cup of coffee (Help... help... help...) So... I understand that you're agent X's secretary Administrative a...ssistant Right Well since you worked so closely with him, (I'm just a little curious who've you overheard) (anything strange the last few days) (Maybe notice anything out of the ordinary) (He didn't discuss anything with you?) (Mentioned taking a trip?) (Think hard) Well, British intelligence have informed us of a possible terrorist threat This is not what we need right now with our biggest agent missing We're still waiting for more information to come in from the Brits I'm gonna go check on some possible leads on agent X In the meantime I want you to sit next to the fax and call me the instant something comes in. I'm depending on you Yes Sir I mean Ma'am Yes... Ma'am Not again [sound of door] - Hey - Hey What are you doing still here? You didn't actually think I was gonna leave you now, did you? We have our problems and everything But in 6 years marriage, I ever let you down Seven... We've been married 7 years. Seven years, four months, two days Come here Right here? Wait. We can't do this, out here. Come on, in here You know you don't have to wait with me I know, but everybody's gone home for the day I figured... keep you some company Um That feels good You like that? What are you doing? What? I thought we could fool around. At a time like this? You're an insensitive prick. What's wrong with you? Great. Now I'm a prick Well you know what? You are a frigid bitch Fuck you! No. Fuck you! [Fax's noise] You can't really be serious about this Oh I'm serious George, wait, shouldn't we call someone, you know, for backup? You saw the report, there's no time. The terrorists are gonna bomb the US in a couple of days The British agents are already in route Exactly why we should call for backup Why? so they could pass the assignment under somebody else? So I can get overlooked. Again. Rachel, I'm fucking tired of getting coffee and dry-cleaning So this is about you? No! (Well... maybe) You selfish jerk I don't think risking my life for my government is selfish It's patriotic Besides, if you hadn't killed our top operative I wouldn't be forced to do this Fine. Well I'm going with you No. No, no. You're not You said it yourself: I'm responsible so I'm going No way If you won't let me go, I'm telling. Fine Yes! My first mission as an agent You're not an agent. You're a secretary I am an administrative assistant Did you hear that? Terrorist I got to call Washington. You're not calling anyone my dear [guy's screaming] [phone dialing] It's me. We've got a problem [beep] - Oh like it's gonna work for you - Tsss You don't even know a code. Um How did you do that?

You know you don't have to make shit up, George Follow me [George's laughing] That's what I'm talking about Is that one of those penis extension things? What? Feeling a little "inferior"?
