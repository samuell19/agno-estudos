[INAUDIBLE] Ambrose? It's fine. It's a school I go to. It's a school full of winners, I guess. People thought I was crazy applying to boarding schools. My parents have to teach summer school to pay the tuition and I get straight A's. My grandfather and my father both came here and from that point on their lives were set. And it's not like that anymore. We have to work for what we want. [NON-ENGLISH] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you to JFK International Airport. The local time here is about 6:35. MALE VOICE: Hey listen, if anything goes wrong, I just want you to know-- FEMALE VOICE: Nothing is going to go wrong. ANNOUNCER: --For your safety and the safety of those around you, please remain seated. [DOG GROWL] Please use caution when opening the overhead. FEMALE VOICE: Stop looking at them. MALE VOICE: I'm not looking at them. FEMALE VOICE: You're freaking me out. OFFICIAL: Passport please. Skiing in Ecuador? FEMALE VOICE: Ever skied a volcano? Just be cool. MALE VOICE: I'm cool. [PANTING] MAN: Ready? I'll count this down. On four-- one, two, three, and wait-- whoa, whoa, wait. Go! [KID'S LAUGHTER] No, you said on four. Oh, the flying hip check. [KID'S LAUGHTER] Oh. Flying body slam. [BEEP] Oh. No, come on! Oh, you got me. Oh. Shit. Fuck! Now I'm going to be late. KID: I told you it was broken. Thanks little man. That's really helpful. [MUSIC PLAYING] Seriously, Josh, who would you choose? I already told you. If I pick Deep Powder then I'm going alone. And it's my birthday so that ticket is mine. Yes, birthday girl. Birthday girl. Come on, you can't go to Ecuador by yourself. Besides, it's been going for, like, 11 years. It's always done by a team. That is just part of the ritual. You and your traditions. A holy ritual. It's a drug run. It's more than a drug run. Idiot, exactly. I'm with you on this. Don't worry. I am totally fucked if I get that ticket. [INAUDIBLE] Deep Powder Alpine Country Club is amazing. It made me feel like I was part of this great tradition. This great group of friends that-- we were going to leave some mark there. Get me-- get me-- oh, look. Look what you've done. That was you. That was totally you. Well, fuck the wallet. Give me some shit. Hey dude! She dropped her wallet under the chairlift if you want to grab it for us. It's not a big deal. Incoming! Oh shit. Oh shit. She's down again. [LAUGHTER] BOY: Come on. [LAUGHTER] GIRL: [INAUDIBLE] think he's cute. BOY: Lift guy? GIRL: You really think he's cute? Seriously girl? Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh my God. There's got to be, like, 300 bucks here. Yeah. You don't know it's hers. What do you mean I don't know it's hers? She dropped it. I saw her drop it. It's right here. This is the girl. That is the girl, my friend. She didn't even look for it. It's abandoned property. That's not right. You know, and as hard as you've been working? Here-- college money. Take that back, man. Come on, that's my half. Just-- thank you. Did you get a 20? - Who's that? - Ms. Taber. Natasha Tabor. I'm telling you-- everything in the whole universe was packed into this tight, little, tiny, little ball. And then you know what happened? It exploded. I mean it shattered-- particles flying everywhere all across the universe. That's not what Ms. Lyle says. I had Ms. Lyle, all right? She doesn't know what she's talking about. What is gravity? Gravity is a force. I don't know what it is exactly to be honest. Do you think it's stronger than love? Love is not a force. Yes it is. It doesn't work like that. Love is not a physical force. Don't listen to him. It's definitely a force. - Hi, mom. - Hi, honey. Hey, mom. Hi, sweetheart. You hung these up outside. They're frozen. What am I going to wear to work tomorrow, Danny? Hey ma, I've got to talk to you. MOM: OK. Will you guys hang these up downstairs? Come on. Just do it. Please. Go. Go. Clutch fell out of the car, Danny. Middle of the road. Nothing I can do, OK? All right, guess who drove up with his tow truck? Freakin' Ronnie-- who agreed to give me a discount, right? If I agreed to go on a date with him. Which I did, but I will not do. Ma, you spent, like, $500. You still have, like, $750 in your account. Look Danny, I'm sorry, OK? There was nothing I could do. I know you're saving up. Housatonic is right down the road. I'm not going to Housatonic. Coach [INAUDIBLE]-- Oh my God. You've got to stop. Housatonic has hockey. It's a club, mom. You hear me? A club. Do you even know what a club is? Please explain to me what a club is. It's a club. Mom, look. Coach said if I can pay for the first year, he'll give me a scholarship for the rest of the way. You need to let it go. Move on, OK? Clutch fell out of the car. You blew your knee out in pre-season. OK? Shit happens. For the first year it's $15,000, OK? That's more than I paid for this house. Housatonic costs, like, $600. I'm not going to HCC. It's a worthless piece of paper. How long are you going to sit up in that booth? Huh? You need to get back into school is what you need to do. [BELL RINGS] [LAUGHTER] BOY: [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER] BOY: A bone. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Hold this for me, will you? I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry. That was really uncool. You work at Pine Hollow, right? Found it. Christ, if you don't get into Cornell there's another booth up on the east hill. My man here has got the west one all locked up. [SLAM] That wasn't cool. Just some townie moon man. Looks like Natasha's moist for moon man, huh? What? Tasha, I'm kidding. GIRL: You hit a nerve. - Hey! Wait up! Hey! I just wanted to say-- thank you. DANNY: She left that on my bike. You slam the door in her face? And then she leaves this on your bike? Damn, you are getting respect Friday night. What's wrong? There's no way I'm going to that party. I mean, with those kids? No way. Wait a minute. I don't care how freaking poor you are. You're going to this party. That girl is wicked sexy. You're going to go and you're going to let her nibble your earlobe, you're going to let her lube your joint, you're going let her ride your rig, you know, get dirty. Whatever floats her boat. But you're going, all right? I grew up with Danny. Our dads used to take us fishing together. You know, he was obsessed with hockey. That was his ticket. I would drive him two hours so he could get that equipment. You know, like, a stick from a friend of a friend. And then he got this scholarship to some school, some college in Pennsylvania. He always wanted to go away to college. But then his dad died and that was blown to hell, so-- [PHONE RINGING] GIRL: Tasha! Tash! Phone! Phone? Is it for me? GIRL: It's your dad. Hurry! Come on! Hurry, hurry! NATASHA: Don't let him hang up. Dad? I've been trying to reach you for, like, two weeks. Oh. You never mentioned it. It's in Kenya, right? Look, I've been thinking about it and I really think I need to come home. No, I don't-- I don't think I should stay here. I promise I will be good. I won't cause you any problems. It's different this time. Dad, please don't hang up. Dad, please. Please. [SNIFF] [SLAM] One, two, three, war. That's what you're wearing? DANNY: What? That's what you wear every day. What are you giving her as a present? Big kids don't give presents. It's not cool. - Come on! Guys! Come on! Catch up! I am king of the forest. Last one up is a rotten egg. Oh, you're going down. Wait, stop. Are you sure you want to do this? Yeah, there's, like, a 17% chance I'll get picked. Do the math. - OK. - Come on, let's go. - OK. [CHEERING] Go big, go home! Go big, go home! Go big, go home! Go big-- KIDS: One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Hey, be good. KIDS: OK. Bye. Bye. Simmer down. Simmer down. Listen up. We have a run to make. Everybody from Chestnut Hill to Penobscot Bay wants our shit. Yeah they do. Woo! The original lift tickets from our founders eight years ago. Woo! Each one of these represents a great run that one of them had at a great mountain. But this one-- Mystic Ridge. Woo! Whoever picks this awesome ticket is southward bound. I'd be honored. All right. Seniors-- seniors-- you know the drill. Come on. Guys. Go ahead, man. - All right. All right. Been here. Choose wisely. Tash. Yeah! Woo! BOY: All right. And the winner is-- drum roll-- Ah, birthday girl! [CHEERING] I'm going down south. BOY: Congratulations. Guys, the eighth annual run of the Deep Alpine Powder Country Club. [CHEERING] [SNIFF] [SNIFF] Natasha. Choose. Who will be going with you? I'm going alone. Tash, come on. Are you crazy? No one's ever done that before. Seriously. I am flying solo. All right, well, you know what? Let's drink, right? Cheers. To Deep Powder Alpine Country-- [CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MALE VOICE [SINGING]: Kiss me like the stars kiss the sky. Kiss me like the stars kiss the sky. [DOOR KNOCK] MALE VOICE: Turn it down in there. MALE VOICE [SINGING]: Love me like a school boy loves his pie. [MUSIC PLAYS LOUDER] MALE VOICE [SINGING]: Hug me like the wind hugs the trees. Hug me like the wind hugs the trees. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. This is my bob-house. Actually it was my dad's. It's a nice bob-house. It's for ice fishing. Oh, I get it. So you pushed it out on the ice. No, we don't push it. It's 800 pounds. We use a snowmobile to pull it out. Make yourself at home. These are really cool. We'd catch perch. [MUSIC PLAYING] TASHA: Do you have a toilet in this bob-house? DANNY: Um, yeah. You open that latch and just go ahead. There's no toilet paper, though. Hey, what were you guys doing at the bar the other night? It's this school tradition. Oh? Go on. Well, a couple of us for spring break or Christmas we go down South America and we score some high quality cocaine. And we bring it back. It's gotten really big. We get checks from Kingsford, Bingly, Mount Hope, you name it. - Wow. - It's kind of like flying. Everyone thinks it's so dangerous, but it's actually safer than driving. Driving what? A car. A car? That's the dumbest thing I've heard in my life. No, it's true. Flying is safer than driving. Hey, you guys. I'm really sorry. Get in the car. Hey, you guys. Please come in the car. Look, I'm sorry, OK? Come on. Be right back. All right, fine. I was 10 minutes late. I'm sorry. OK? Come on. Try 40. Come on, that's not true, Travis. Let's go. - I'm hungry. Who's that? It's a friend of mine. I've got to say, I do think it's really unfair to just keep people waiting like that. - Exactly. Did you say you were hungry? LISA: Yeah. - All right. Let's see. I think I might have some snacks in here. Some peanuts and chocolate. I remember when I was little, my dad or one of my step-moms, they would always leave me places. I remember this one time they completely left me at ballet. It sucked. Where was your mom? Well, she died. Awesome. Our dad died, too. He got cancer. What happened to your mom? She killed herself. Yeah, that's usually a conversation stopper. Anyway. All right, come on. What did you do when nobody picked you up? I was too embarrassed to say anything, so I hid in the bathroom. Ooh, the bathroom. What do you think about that? That stinks. Yeah, it did. You go to Mount Ambrose. That's a fancy school. I like yours better. You're starting to sound like you want to be joining them or something. No, I'm just saying they can-- they can do anything they want. They can go anywhere, you know? You and me, man, we're planning right here. - Give me a Phillips head. - You don't even seem to notice. Give me a Phillips head. I notice. I don't choose to dwell on it. Let me see. What is this? Let me see this. It's pretty cool, huh? It's Johnny Rivers. See that? They're hollow inside. What, all the way? All the way. You don't get it, Coda, do you? - I get it. - There's no future for us here. I'm-- we're just working and working, I mean-- No, you're working. I'm managing. Careful. What are these holes? Um, they're ice fishing holes. Careful. If you fall in, you're dead. - Yeah. We're not allowed to go on the pond at Mount Ambrose. Yeah. That's because there's natural springs under the water. And where it looks frozen it's not. Some kid went in in like the '60s. Yeah. It takes a minute or two. So we should jump in the holes then? Let's go swimming. [LAUGHTER] I don't know her. I just know her. You know, I'd seen her around. And um, Danny told me about her. But I get why he would hang around with her. I mean, she's super sexy, you know? Um, I think she's a little crazy. And I think Danny liked that. [CHURCH BELL] So you, um-- you can pack the drugs in these. And, um, it slides all the way down. And then you just-- it closes like that. And you can literally pack the whole area under the boot. They'll never suspect anything. That's genius. You think so? All right. Good. [DOOR KNOCKING] MAN: Tasha? Are you in there? (WHISPERING) Fuck. No. Go, go, go. I'm sorry. Did I wake you up? Wow. Holy shit, this is a lot of money. $35,000. I have an AP Euro paper I have to finish. Wait a minute. Sit down. Just sit down. I'm going to fail AP Euro. Not, you're not. Look, you can't go to Ecuador by yourself. OK? It's too dangerous. And you're certainly not going to take the lift guy. His name is Danny. OK, you can't take Danny with you. I'm going alone. Tash, you're going with me. Look, this isn't a joke. Look, it's not an island vacation. It's Ecuador. OK? It's dangerous. I can't let you do this. You can't let me do that? MAN: Are you having fun? All right, then. We don't do the run. You crazy bitch. OK, OK, OK, OK. But I'm done defending you when people say that you're nuts, because you are fucking crazy. You better not fuck this up. He's an asshole. I was lying when I said I wanted to go alone. You can have my share of the money. I don't want it. I want you to go with me. I don't really know anything about him though. I mean, I know that-- that-- you know, he-- he doesn't go to school. I don't know. He's not going to school maybe. Honestly, I-- I don't know what she saw in him. I think she just wanted something different, to be honest. She wanted an escape from her life here. We're going to find you. So much fun. Where is it? She is so taunting us. Yeah. Oh, behind the curtain! No. Under the bed! Under the bed! [SCREAMING] We're not allowed to touch those. That's my daddy's stuff. So cool. You know, this is awesome! We're not allowed to play those. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] Hey, you guys need to come get these records. I'm serious. No way. No, no, no. I don't dance. I don't even know how to dance. KIDS: Yes, you do. I do? What do I do? Something like this? A little bit of that? Huh? All right. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC TURNING OFF] What happened? We told her not to do it. Hi. Sorry. They asked me not to. It's totally my fault. You have a great collection. Those were my husband's records. You come into my home, and you go into my bedroom? You guys go into my closet? You know not to do that. Get out. Mom. I'm sorry. Sorry, Mom. Let me see you. Come here. [CRYING] A lot of people thought I could do better than Ken Kolcheck. He had a beer gut in high school, you know. But I just-- I love that guy, you know. I love that guy. And there was nothing that anybody could have said that would have stopped me. And I knew that that girl was trouble for Danny, but I also saw the way he looked at her. There was nothing that I could do about it. [PHONE RINGING] [DOOR KNOCKING] MAN: Natasha, it's that guy. I'm not here. I got the kids a present. I wanted to get your mom something, too. I feel really bad. It's her that should feel bad. The way she went off on you like that. That's how she gets around anything having to do with my dad. He has a really amazing record collection. She should give them to Goodwill. No way. They're your dad's. Yeah, they're my dad's. And he's gone. I mean, maybe he's up in heaven. Maybe he's just gone. But she's got to let it go. I mean, those records-- they don't bring him back, you know? You're lucky, you know. I'm lucky? Yeah? This-- this is lucky. Now she won us the 1979 Wabanaki Derby. Yeah. It's a big deal. That's impressive. Are you ready for this kind of luck? You have to be committed. Are you ready? - OK. - All right. Tash, I have consistently-- and I can back this up-- consistently despite psycho-pharmacological conditions been able to make you laugh for years. So I think it's in your best interest to take me to South America with you, because you will have the time of your life. That's not going to happen. And on a different subject-- and I'm not trying to scare you guys-- but airport security is becoming a completely different game here. I saw last night that there's been people busted in Houston and Miami. And I'm pretty sure that New York is going to be next. - Not for coke. - No. Yes, for coke. Now, I reserved a ticket. I just-- it doesn't make any sense for you going alone, all right? I've got the connections down there. I know what I'm doing. Seriously, Tash. Can you at least promise me that you're not going to do anything stupid? I'm just worried about you, OK? I promise I won't be stupid. I got to go. Go? We have study hall in 15 minutes. You left your bag. TASHA: Grab my bag. It's a mandatory class, Tash. TASHA: Just grab my bag. I practiced that speech like in the mirror like 10 times. You practiced that? Shit. Shit. Hey. Hi. What's up? Are you busy? No. I mean, yeah. Totally. I'm shutting down. Why, do you want to play basketball? No. The exciting life of a lift attendant playing video games. What are you-- [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] She's kind of above it all, you know? Doesn't really care about anything. She just doesn't care about school, grades. She just kind of-- I mean, she lives. I'm always happy when I'm around her. She really made it-- she really made Mount Ambrose a good time for me. A good place. You know, first she comes off as kind of tough and independent, but she's actually pretty fragile. Huh? Please. No, you look like my grandmother in Miami. Even Eddie Lamont doesn't do coke. That kid's a fuck up. Try those on. This pays my whole first year. I got to do it. That shit is for rich kids. How do I look? Better on me, right? I look like a giant bug, right? How about these? What-- are you going to join the Highway Patrol? You look like an idiot. Oh, man. Maybe you are an idiot. I don't know. I don't know. DANNY: You're the idiot, OK? I'm going to college. Let me see. Hmm. Seriously, think. I have something for you. What? Our tickets. What? - Oh. It's just, um-- when you said Christmas break, I didn't actually think Christmas day. I thought it would be awesome. No, it would be great. It's just Travis and Lisa. Right. I wasn't thinking. I'm kind of just free falling here. I don't even know where that is on a map. It's below Columbia next to Peru. South America. Oh, South America. I had to change the tickets but it was kind of late, so I'll be back Christmas morning. Well, you're 20 years old. I can't tell you what to do. But you are going to tell Lisa and Travis yourself. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh my god. MAN (VOICEOVER): Take a taxi down to San Lorenzo on the coast. I booked you a suite at the Grand Royal. It's a great place to stay since you'll be on your own. It's only four stars but you'll blend in with all the tourists. I want you to stay off the beaches. They're not safe. [LAUGHTER] I'll get you! [MUSIC PLAYING] Are you alone now? Are you alone now? Are you alone now? MAN (VOICEOVER): Now, you should have no problem getting in touch with Carmello. And you can trust Carmello-- which by the way, is not his real name. Now, This is the part that scares me. Your Spanish-- let's just say, is pathetic. [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN (VOICEOVER): Now, Carmello works for my cousin's friend who's based in Columbia. They truck the blow across the Ecuadorian border, and they send it out on boats with flowers from San Lorenzo. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Hi. Hola. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] - What? - [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] - [SPEAKING SPANISH] - Oh, thank you. It was mi madre's. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [INTERPOSING VOICES] OK. OK. OK. I got it, OK? No. No, Danny. I want to see it. Dude, I got it. [INTERPOSING VOICES] - Yeah. Yeah. Si. Si. Si. OK. I'm sorry. Lo siento. I want to see it. - OK. Esta bien. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [INTERPOSING VOICES] He's trying to fuck us over. This is bullshit. No, I want my money back. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SCREAMING] Listen. Dinero. Por favor. What were you thinking? - What? He had a machete. Now he has our money. You don't fucking yell at the guy. I know what I'm doing. That stuff was crap. Who cares? Now he has our money, and we have nothing. OK. Well, that's not my fault. You're the one who handed it over like a good boy. No, I didn't hand it over. He took it when you yelled at him. We're going to be fine. No, Natasha. I'm fucked, you understand? I'm fucked. But you go back to your cushy life with your fancy schools. And I understand. Yeah, yeah, it makes you miserable, OK? But I go back to that booth on top of that shit mountain permanently! CHILDREN: Dinero, dinero, dinero, dinero. That's where I have to go, you understand? That's where I have-- I don't have any money. We just lost our money, OK? We just lost it. Take my fucking shoes. CHILDREN: Dinero. - Danny. Danny. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Can I sit? Sure. Hi. CARMELLO: [SPEAKING SPANISH] Para tu mama, OK? [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Hey. Thank you. Danny? Hey. I got it. Come on. I got it. Yeah. Hey, look at me. You're going to be great, Danny Kolcheck. [MUSIC PLAYING] TASHA: I wish we could stay this way forever, college boy. DANNY: What about you? I'm just a little fucked up right now, that's all. There's fucked up, right? And then there's fucked up. Not like you tried to kill somebody. I tried. Oh, yeah? TASHA: Yeah. - Who? Well, this girl. Yeah. She wanted to be put out of her misery so. I mean, come on. Everyone thinks about it. Not me. I think it's a cop out. It's not a cop out. You shouldn't say stuff like that. I wish it was a cop out. Hey. Hey. Listen, if anything goes wrong-- Nothing is going to go wrong. You're going to jinx it. It looks good, OK? We're going to be fine. - OK. You've checked it like 100 times. You're freaking me out. You all right? I think I'm going to ralph. [VOMITING] You OK? TASHA: Fine. - All right. FLIGHT ATTENDENT (VOICEOVER): [SPEAKING SPANISH] JFK International Airport. For your safety and the safety of all those around you-- CUSTOMS OFFICIAL: Passports, please. Anything to declare? DANNY: No, sir. CUSTOMS OFFICIAL: How was your stay? TASHA: Just a week. CUSTOMS OFFICIAL: Business or pleasure? DANNY: Pleasure. It was a skiing vacation. [DOG BARKING] CUSTOMS OFFICIAL: You two need to come with me. Terrible habit. Looks like you're good to go. Great. You know what? Let me just check your skis, then you can go and have your Christmas. Pretty big skier, huh? - Yeah, I guess. What do you mean, you guess? Ecuador? Volcanoes? Can you explain this? They're Johnny Rivers. It's just how they're made, I guess. Something wrong? All right. You're all set. Danny. Aw, what a cute teddy bear. Or is it-- no. It's a lion, right. It's for my little brother. How old is he? He's 10. I want to know what's going to happen to Danny Kolcheck. You've known this Danny for what? A couple of months? Your girlfriend-- her lawyer is going to have her out of here in no time. She's a minor. But you, you're-- you're 20, right? I'm trying to do the right thing. The right thing? Smuggling drugs from South America? I would say that trusting your instinct to do the right thing is about the last thing you should do. This is bullshit. I have to tell you, you're looking at 10 to 15 minimum. That's years. I want names. I don't think you did this alone. If you let me, I can help you. But first, you need to help me. Starting with your girlfriend. You can walk out of here. TASHA (VOICEOVER): We need to pay his bail. Get him a lawyer. We have to help him. Hey. What you're doing here? Danny and I got busted at JFK. I need your help. You lied to me. What's going to happen to him? Listen, you need to focus on taking care of Natasha Tabor. I know she's a good kid, but she gets a little carried away sometimes. But she is going to go back to Mount Ambrose. And she's going to finish up her senior year, and she is going to graduate. All right. This is the truth if anybody asks, OK? And I do mean anyone, Crash. We just lockstep on this, and we're going to be fine. It's Suzy's choice. This is not our fault. Cool? All right. I'll see you in school. All right, bye. Mrs. Schofield? Hey, this is Duncan Kazmir calling. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Thank you. It was very nice to hear your voice, too. Um, is Elizabeth there? Mom? DUNCAN (VOICEOVER): Smack. I'm sorry. DUNCAN (VOICEOVER): We knew a little bit about Danny. We just kind of assumed what was going on. We didn't know anything about the drugs, anything about the South America run. We all tell that and we're fine. Like I said, I don't see Danny involved with something like this. So I don't think he even knew anything about it. Maybe Natasha just wanted somebody to, you know, tag along with her and maybe put the blame onto. Deep Powder-- it's been going on for about 10 years. It's just a-- it's a club that we seniors do. It's part of our ski team. It's some-- it's kind of a dumb little social, you know, fraternal thing that we do. It's-- it's kind of hard to describe, because it's-- it's-- we make it into such a big thing here, but it's really just kind of harmless. It's just a club. It's just-- a-- a barn in the woods where we hang out. It's nothing more than that. And we go skiing every-- every winter. Um, Kaz's brother, Teddy, he, uh-- he founded it. And he kind of was like, let's find the best peaks, and let's ride them. You guys look scary. We're cool. Speak for yourself. I'm far from cool. We need to know if you're with us or against us. Shut up, dude. Who talks like that? - What is this? Some kind of weird interrogation? DUNCAN: It's a yes or no question. We just need to do what you told them. Nothing. My attorney wouldn't let me. You talked to your attorney? Why would you do that? What do you want from me? We need our checks. I don't have your checks. You're a liar. [MUSIC PLAYING] Kaz? I'll be up in a bit, guys. She's gone. I tried to pay Danny's bail. I know it was my fault. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Here. It's worth at least $10,000. It was my grandmother's. Please take it. Bail is $125-- thousand. Ms. Kolcheck, please. Get off my property. On gate. [BUZZER] [INTERPOSING VOICES] Are you OK? You need to tell me what happened. How did you get involved in this? Have you heard from her? Did she call? No. Where's your lawyer? I have no idea what you think you're up to here, Miss Tabor. But the fact that you even came here could get my case thrown out of court, so I'm done talking to you. You're a minor. Miss O'Connor, please. Danny had nothing to do with this. It was all my fault. OK? Here's evidence. I have checks, maps, names. I just told you. I can't touch this mess. He had nothing to do with this. Do you realize you're incriminating yourself? Yes. I don't care. There's a simple solution to this. Get your boyfriend to talk. I can't. His family won't let me speak to him. Please. I'll see what I can do. [BUZZER] COP: This way ma'am, down this-- your inmate's name that you're here to see? Um, Danny Kolcheck. Kissing and holding hands is across the table only. Hey. Where the hell have you been? Huh? I didn't hear a thing from you. They wouldn't let me. I spoke to my lawyer. I went to your house. I begged your mom. I basically had to sneak in here. You, um-- do you remember when you-- when you told me that you were free falling? I'm fine. Just hear me out, OK? You, um-- you're so full of life. I mean it. More than anyone I've ever met. If anything were to happen to you. Danny, you need to tell them the truth. Look, the cops-- they won't take this from me. But you can give this to them. And you can tell the truth, and you'll be out of this. Is that what they told you? Natasha, they tell you that to manipulate you. It's their job. I got caught with a kilo of cocaine. It's not your fault. Yeah, it is. It's definitely my fault. Turn you in-- it's not going to help. Danny, you have to stop protecting me. What about your mom? I can't take that. What about Travis and Lisa? Hmm? I can't live with myself. Natasha, you have to. I'm ready to go. Natasha. I love you. Natasha. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hello? NATASHA (ON PHONE): [CRYING] Natasha. Where are you? NATASHA (ON PHONE): [CRYING] GIRL: Say something. I can't talk you anymore. None of us can. Our parents won't let us. [CRYING] DANNY (VOICEOVER): I need to hear from you. I need to know you're OK. She could be very unstable. She makes impulsive decisions. And I don't think that this is the, uh, first time that she's disappeared. I think this is definitely the longest she's ever disappeared. Obviously, if I knew where she was, I would do something about it but I don't. DANNY (VOICEOVER): Why haven't I heard from you? I don't understand. I love you. I think it's pretty obvious what happened to Natasha. I don't-- I was the one who found out that she was missing. I told the Dean of Students. I even met with the headmaster. They didn't do anything to help her. They didn't do anything to try and find her. mean, Has her dad even come back from Europe to look for her? She's been missing for almost two weeks. [CRYING] I could have helped her and I didn't. [CRYING] A fisherman found her things in the middle of the pond in Mount Ambrose. The hole she busted through is frozen over. You need to tell us what you two talked about when you last saw her. [CRYING] Hey! Got her. [LAUGHTER] [CRYING] DANNY (VOICEOVER): Once you see what they have, you want it. It's not even just the money, but it's the whole way they live and enjoy life. I've never been around anything like that. That's the Deep Powder Aline country club. Kaz's older brother started this tradition of going down to South America with a group of his Mount Ambrose ski buddies. And they were like a secret society. COP: I need you to identify these Mount Ambrose kids. Those kids-- I don't even know their real names. I mean, that's-- that's Snack, and that's Crash, that's Kaz. Kaz was pretty much in charge. What did they say? I mean, why would Kaz say all that shit if he-- if it weren't for the fact that he was one of the ones that did it, you know? I don't even know what to say to that that you would try to put that blame on me. And put that blame on-- on the rest of this school and that club. Yes, I fully understand the circumstances that we're in and the consequences. If I tell you what you want to know, will you-- will I have a way out of this? It was supposed to be me. It was supposed to be me that went down to get the coke. [MUSIC PLAYING] They're in the living room. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Oh! Oh! - Oh! Yes! Go, go, go! Oh! Get the chick. Get the kick. Stop. Yeah, hit the chick. No kidding. No, it's fine. I want you to try. No, it's mine. - No! - No. No. Stay. Come on. One more. - Try to pass, Trav. - Careful. Hey, you might hit me with that. Bam-o. You guys can keep playing. TRAVIS: No. Come on. TRAVIS: Come on, one more. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Look up and let me see heaven. From two stories down you'll pass by. I hope that you know my conscious said no. But you made me madness a pleasure. And don't you want? And don't you need? And [INAUDIBLE] my fantasy. With the madness in front of me. A million ways to love her. A million little pieces of my soul. A million ways to love her. A million little pieces of my soul. The street that you walk on below me. Rolls out like a red carpet, lover. I know you should enter my labyrinth of thunder. Cause my brain is a structure of wonder. And don't you wonder? And don't you need? A [INAUDIBLE] a fantasy with the madness that's in me. A million ways to love her. A million a little pieces of my soul. A million ways to love her. A million little pieces of my soul. A million ways to love her. A million little pieces of my soul. A million ways to love her. A million little pieces of my soul. A million. A million little, love.
