- Mom, catch it! Catch it! - Marion! Shoot! Pass! There! Cheat! - Come on, Julien! Get a move on! - I'm coming! I'll put it back in. One, two, three! Quick, quick! Penalty! Here! - Come on Marion, goal! - Give me my goal! Three-nil. Three! Give it to me. You don't want to spoil your sheen. - Julien, have you finished? - Yes. Come on, I'll wash you. Pass me the mirror, Mom. Please. Just look how beautiful he is. It's a punk hairstyle. Can you count? Okay. One, two, three... - What are you looking for? - My cigarettes. - Well? How long? - Ten. - That's not true, you didn't count. - Yes, I did. - No, you didn't! - I tell you, I did! - Rubbish! - I'm telling you, I did! Come on! Stop it! Julien, stop it! I bet you can't stay under water longer than me. - What do you bet, son? - 10. How far can you count to? - Er... One thousand! - That's not enough. - Let's start. - Okay. Put your pajamas on first. - One, two, three. - No, Michel! Michel, what are you doing? Stop it! Let's drown Mom! Help! We'll get Mom all wet! No! Stop it! Julien, go away, please. - Pass me the milk, please. - Here you are. Get some beef or a big chicken. An arm wrestle? I'm too strong. Hi! - Everything okay? - Yes. I didn't have enough for a big chicken. I got a piece of meat. Okay. This came today. - Beautiful, aren't they? - Yeah, too beautiful. - Can you see yourself? - Yes. Aren't you going to open it? Won't you open it now? Not here. Come on! - Wow, it's beautiful! - Shall I take your satchel? I'm going to win. - No, it's me. - No, me. Watch out! I win! Julien and Marion, get your shoes. Give me those while you're at it. - Thank you, Sir. - Don't mention it, Madam. Can I have your shirt, please? I'm washing whites. Anyone have any whites? Thanks. Here, take that for the cat. You were hungry, right kitty? There were only the normal ones! - Shall I fasten it back on? - Yes. - Anything else? I'm washing whites. - No. Haven't you opened it? Ah, that's pretty! It's for summer vacation. It's pretty. Go on. Try it on. Try it on! It fits you well, doesn't it? It's too small? - It's okay. - It's pretty, isn't it? It fits you very well. Move away, so I can have a look at you. Yes, it's nice. Ah no, colors were yesterday. Today it's whites. What do you think of it? You know very well she'll never wear a thing like that. For you, addict! Thanks, Dad. Hey, give me a hand. Pass me the cans. Is it heavy? Come on! Careful you don't drop them on my head. That's toxic. I don't want to go bald right away. That's for killing the bugs in the water once I've finished making it watertight. When will it be finished? Don't know. If all goes well, you can dive in during summer vacation. That's if I can work in peace... I saw a car on the highway today. What are you talking about? Someone just got lost. - What sort of car? - A construction vehicle. With workers. Where was it? Just over there. Near my playhouse. Why didn't you tell us before? I forgot. He's telling stories. You're telling us lies, aren't you? Are you lying? It's a fib, isn't it? Go and see for yourself if you don't believe me! - Liar! - Admit that you lied! Poor guy! - We'll make you talk. - Stop! Mercy! Stop! - Aren't you ashamed, lying to your family? - Okay. I lied, mercy! Stop! You see? He's telling stories. Where was it? Over there, I think. - Are you sure? - Sure. But not completely... All right, you can drive back. Did you see the trucks? Yeah, but we hid in the playhouse when they arrived. - Did they drive by your house? - Guys, look what I've found! Look! What is it? Let's see! Look! It's still quite hot. - It stinks! - It's sticky! - Where did you find that? - It's disgusting! What's happened to you? What's that on your face? Look! there and there. And look there. Move along. Move out of the way. And look here. - And here too. - You've been messing around in the tar. What time did they come by? Sometime in the afternoon. - Did you see them? - Of course. - And...? - And what? - What did they say? - Nothing. Why should they? They must have said something. Did they put all this into the yard? They didn't say anything. It was quick. None of the sets work. Is it because the dish is down? That's nothing to do with it. It is not coming from here. Look at this kid's face. Who did that to him? I couldn't do anything else. He's covered himself in tar. Still nothing. I'm sure the highway guys cut the cables on purpose. What cables? Soak your feet in the basin instead of talking nonsense. Can't you turn that off? You never know. It can come back anytime. Julien, stop fidgeting, please. That's no use. It won't go. I'll get some turpentine tomorrow. Julien, lift your foot, please. - They're really coming this time. - Will there be real cars, then? What do you expect? It can't stay a skate-run forever. Julien, lift your feet up. Otherwise I can't wash you. Stop fussing with his feet! I told you I'll get some turpentine tomorrow. Why are you so angry? Did you hear what I said? Yes, I heard. They are coming this time. And? They've talked about opening it since we settled here. Marthe. - What? - If they?re tarring it's a question of days. It doesn't mean anything. They already tarred once, and nothing happened. It's been like that for 10 years. Look, don't start things up! Can I get out of the tub? Yes, here you are... We're fine since coming here, aren't we? You're not going to make us move? Where'd we go? What'd we do? This is our home. Let's wait and see... And after all, we're used to noise... What are you doing? Hurry! You're a pain, Marion! Can't you act like everyone else? I could drown you... Stop it! Julien and Marion, let's go in. School tomorrow. Bye-bye! Come on! Take big steps, Julien. It's not too sticky? Is it okay? There you go! ...back again in seven minutes for the next traffic spot. It's back. Radiohighway, a spot every 7 minutes. 24 hours a day. And on Radiohighway, the top spot is the opening... of the new section of Route E57... They're talking about us. Route E57. ...scheduled for tonight. Scram, Julien! Dad! It's this evening! Radiohighway is talking about us. I repeat: scheduled for tonight the opening of Route E57... We'll be back on our inauguration cover in 7 minutes. Did they say what time it would open? I don't think so. I dunno. They said this evening. Tonight. We'll know soon enough... Stop! Hey! Hey! What time is it opening? This evening, tonight... My dad said not before 3:00 in the morning. What does your dad know? - His boss told him. - How does his boss know? Good evening, Sir. - Are you smoking? - Er... No. - Bye! - Aren't you staying? You're crazy! We'll get killed! Shit, when they open the valves! Bye! Bye! - You'll tell us about it... - Yeah. I've nearly finished. Why don't you go back to work? What makes you say that? You've all you need at home. I'm not saying that for us. But I'm very happy here with you. I couldn't stay shut in all day. What are you on about, I'm not in prison. You're not cold? I bet the first car... will come from... From there! A green one. A red one. A green as ours, want to bet? A red one. - A green one. - A red one. - A green one. - A red one. A green one. A red one. Hear that? That's a green one's sound. No, it's a red one's sound. It hasn't started. That's true, I didn't hear anything. - Hasn't it started? - No. Did you see the first motorists to take Route E57? I did, Bruno. I even saw the very first motorist to take the highway. A certain Mr. Georges Schwed. A name to remember... He entered it at exactly 7:00 a.m., at the wheel of his red VW. I've won! It's a red one! The first car's red! What's the time? To the exact minute? 7:22 If Mr. Georges Schwed's red car left Favi?res-South at 7:00... at an average speed of 120 km/h... It should pass by in a second or two. Julien! Stay here and eat up, please. - How do you know? - I work it out. - And how do you work it out? - In my head. ...the first car, the first man... to take the highway is Mr. Schwed, 42, working at Louvigny. I met him just as he entered the section Favi?res-South / Wissant in his red VW. It's a blue one. It's extraordinary! It's wonderful, un-hoped for! Hurry up, Julien, I'll help while it's still possible. They're not ready. I'll do it. - Are you sure? - Of course, it'll be okay. In half an hour it could be too late. No! Get going, you're late. Julien, hurry up! After the green one, okay? What's wrong, Mom? After the gray one, okay? Okay, cross over and I'll keep watch. Go on, Marion. Hold his hand. Go on. Hurry up! Hurry up, the bus is coming! Bye-bye! The new section of Route E57 opened at 7:00 a.m. And the star of the day is the first user of the new section of Route E57. He's called Georges Schwed, a name to remember. Jean Luc Pacard was there to hear his first impressions. It's extraordinary! It's wonderful. Un-hoped for. And I'm the first on it, too. What changes will this new highway bring you personally? A radical change! I must drive between Favi?res-South and Louvigny. 1h30 in the morning, 1h30 in the evening. 3 hours is infernal. When you stay on the A road with the jams, the stress... Have you been waiting long for the reopening of this highway? We didn't believe it. 10 years ago they started... suddenly everything stopped... - Hey! - Hey! Nobody thought it would reopen. It'll mean a complete change for all the inhabitants of the area. It started. I know, I heard, I'm not deaf. What did you do to my lounger? Your dad slept outside. They crossed without a problem. It increased all morning, but now it's fallen off. Want to hear it? You'll hear for yourself. Wait... Hold on. Still there? Did you hear? Did you hear? What? Wait... Hold on. What time will you be home? Can't you come back earlier? I'd have liked you to, that's all. Okay, I'll tell them. They'll wait for you. Stay on the other side, wait for your father! What? Stay there! I've got your snack ready! Throw it! Throw it! Go on! Wait. I'll do it. No. Stay there. Take a run up! Go on, throw it! Throw, Mom! Is it okay? Can you eat it? Don't eat what's touched the ground. Just what's wrapped up. Okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Know the tunnel over there? I've gone through at least 100 times. Get in the car, let's go. - And? - Come on! All clear! Go through, Marion. There's no risk. Go on. It's filthy. It's full of creepies. We'll use it till vacation. After that, we'll see. - You okay, Marion? - Yes. Are you coming, Dad? Let's go! You are over 5000. Exactly 5157, that's already very promising... ...to have taken the new section of Route E57 in less than 24 hours. It's already a very good start, a downright success. No! Let go! Look, it's Mr. Schwed's car! He's late today! Get a move on! Radiohighway, 108.1. What are you doing there? Nothing, why? I'm just listening to the radio. Give us a high note. The ones with cotton aren't bad. Higher. Again. Aren't these better? Hold on. Quiet, Julien! Go on, say something. Great. Can't hear a thing. - You're stupid! - Julien said nothing? What'll we do when there are 80 a minute? - 80 what? - 80 cars. Now the average is between 15 and 20. Must get hot in there! Haven't heard of restraint? You're completely crazy! How many cars since the start? 53,800. Margin of error between 10 and 15%. You're sure? - And trucks? - 4700. Same error margin. And 214 motorbikes. I count for an hour a day, always at the same times. That's important. - And green cars? - Idiot! Get me some grass from nearest to the cars. CO2, toxic gas. I can't see anything abnormal. Just a little mark there which must be checked. I'll circle it. It's certainly saturnism. That means lead poisoning. Okay, now me. Well...? There are a few spots. What are they like? Small, a bit red. - Some others, a bit white. - How many? - Red or white? - Both. - Think it's the highway? - What do you think? Micro particles from the exhausts settle everywhere. What then? What do we get? Constipation. Pallor. Vomiting. Problems of anorexia. Psychomotor diminution. Risk of sterility. Irritability. Sleeping problems. I've checked everything. Not to mention the fact we haven't finished growing. And if it gets worse? And we're all ill? Will we stay here much longer? We'll never leave. Mom only feels well here. - What is it? - Stocks for vacation! But you're crazy! How shall we manage? It's okay. We can move. Down! Down! Easy... - Hurry. Quick. - The shopping. Here... Wait! Okay, it's fine. Let's go. Straight! Ahead! Careful with the shopping. Stop! Quick! One, two, three! Down! Julien, come here! You're nuts! - Let's cross. Quick! - Wait! - Is it okay? - Yes. Put it down. - Stop! Wait! - What? I think that I saw something. Hurry, move back. What gives? Wait, it's coming. - There's nothing! - It's coming. It's coming... So? What are you doing? Nothing... Go to sleep... Okay, scram! Where are you? Okay, get back on the highway. Keep left... No, left and go North. A mailbox? That's us. Keep going. I can see you. Go on, keep going on... Stop! You're there. A Pizza Party for summer vacation! You'll hear the highway much less. - Julien! - It's difficult, Mom. It's heavy. You will feel much better here. We'll see after summer vacation. Michel, come and help us! - And this one? - On my head. I'm sleeping there. - No. - Yes. No, that's my bed. I'm sleeping next to dad. - No... - Next to dad. Next to mom. Next to dad. Everyone in the bedroom! Is there room for me? - Put down her mattress. - Move off. Careful! Careful! You all right there? Yeah! I'm fine. You'll be much quieter here. Come here, my little boy. My little boy I love. Sleepy, sleepy girls. Quiet! Quiet, I said. Go to sleep. Stop it! - It's so hot! - Stop it! That's enough! Otherwise you all go back! I'm not on holiday! I work tomorrow! Where are the earplugs? It looks as if she?s dancing. She hasn't slept for nights. She's worn out. I've counted. There are less cars on ours. Julien, stop it! Stop it! - Change! - Stop it! - You bug me! - Stop it! Stop making noise. You're driving me mad. Can't you find something to do? I'm going. Well how long is it? 1 hour 38. At that stage, it's suicide. - Don't go! It's madness! - Let him be! I'm going. - Shall I fasten it back on? - What? - Shall I fasten it back on? - No! Route E57 has been invaded, the situation is urgent. Careful! Come on, Joe! It's hot in here! Not that! Come out! You're quite crazy! This water is filthy. Fine particles are real crap. Turn round. They block the pores. They penetrate everywhere. Feet. Hands. I've counted the cars. There are ten times more. At this rate, we won't outlive the summer. We'll all die before. All of us. Stop it! Want to die a slow death? Stop growing, remain a dwarf your whole life? I'm doing this for your good. It's for you. Because I love you. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Julien! He's crazy! Julien! Can I ask you a question? How can you stay there all day long? I don't care, that's all. Anyway, my blood has a really high level of antibodies. A terribly strong immunity. I was born with that. You're lucky. I'm the opposite. Here, I've got others. Open up, Mom! Open up! Open up! Please, Mom! Mommy... Open up, Mom... It's Julien, Mom. It?s Julien, Mom. ...a sensor on each wheel measures the rotation speed of the wheel... What are you doing up here? I've a lead mark. What are you on about? A poisoning mark. There. The middle of my back. No, that's a mosquito bite. It's okay... Come on. What's the matter? What's wrong? Are you looking at your crap? No, why? It's Marion. She says it changes because of lead in the vegetables. It's not true. Marion's talking rubbish. Don't listen to her. I've peed on myself. It's nothing. Can you sleep a bit now? Tomorrow evening I'm on holiday. We'll finish the pool together. Okay? Come on... Radiohighway traffic news in French and in English every seven minutes. I repeat, following an accident: traffic on Route E57 brought to a halt. Patience, take courage... Don't stare! ...several hours to get the traffic going again. Get dressed. We're going out. Marion, tell your sister to get dressed. We're going out. We're going out. Mom asks if you?re coming too. - What? - Are you coming? No, I'm not. She's staying. Don't look at them. Thank you, Sir. Come on! More to the left. Lower. To the right. No, the other right. What do they say on the radio? Fuck it, all this crap. Scram, bags of shit! Marion, help me, please. Why don't we stay here? - Yes, it's nice here. - We're in a field. - We can't live in a field. - Why not? Come on. It's over. Let's go. Come on! Oh, there you are! Well, fancy that! So you've come back? You're so stupid! Really so stupid. Where were you? Judith isn't with you? - What? - Judith? She stayed here? So where is she? Well, what shall we do? What do you want to do? Call the police? They'll say she's an adult. Perhaps she's been run over. Perhaps she's dead. Why are you saying that? It's stupid! She's shown off her boobs so often, someone's finished by picking her up. Julien? Are you asleep? Julien, are you asleep? Wake up. Mom, I don't want to anymore. What? I don't want to anymore. I'm tired. I want to sleep. Keep going. Make the most of it. It's the best hour. It'll do you good. Mom... - Go on, hurry up. - Mom, please... What are you doing? We had great fun. Didn't we, Julien? You made him go skating? You woke him for it? Let go, you're hurting me! We were waiting for Judith. Julien, wake your sister and pack your bag. We're leaving! Marion, wake up! We're leaving! Marion, get dressed. We're not staying a second longer. And you, get your things. Hurry up! What are you doing? I said, go and get your things. Pack your bag. Hurry up! - Or I'll go without you! - Where's Mom? And what about Judith? Judith isn't coming back. You can leave with the kids if you like. I can't, I can't do it. I really can't do it. Do it again, start all over again, I can't, I can't do it. And what'll I do then? What can I do? It's perhaps not easy here, but it's our home. - Leave if you want. - Stop that! - Take them away! - Stop it! - You're coming, too! - No, I don't want to leave! - You're coming too! - No! Let go of me! No! Stop it! Stop it! - No! - You're coming, too! Let go! Stop it! Michel, stop it! Let go, let go, Michel! Leave, all of you! Take them away! Take them away! Take them away! Let go! Stop it! Let me go! Open up! Open up! It's over. It's over. Here! We could've done this earlier! Go on! That's nice, isn't it? It stings! - No, it's okay. - Here. - Why don't you block it all up? - We need ventilation. You call that ventilation...? I think you can still hear it here. Here, too. Perhaps we'd better put on another layer... Can't you turn it down to one? On three, it's too strong. It bothers me when I read. And on two? No, it's still too strong. I'm sorry, I won't go any lower. We're suffocating in here. I'm doing whites. Do you have any? Here! What? I know, I don't look like Judith. What do you think of me? There's still some noise. - She's asleep... - Of course, she's asleep. She's not dead. - Perhaps she's pretending. - Rubbish... She simply can't do anything more. Mom, wake up! Wake up, Mom! - Wake up now! - What are you up to? Stop it at once! Stop it! It's contaminated. Want to try it? Wait! You must sleep a bit. Take this. Get this glass of water. You take half of one. Aren't you going to kiss me? How shall we breathe? You said we needed ventilation. Aren't you asleep? Wait. - Here, take that if it can help. - No, I'll try without. Don't go downstairs! It's a mess. Wait for me here.
