The thing thrown on the tip at the Chinese border is me. My name is Aglaé, and it's no surprise it happened. This is me, 3 months ago. I had a quiet, simple, orderly life. I might not have looked it, but I was as happy as a hamster on its wheel. I'd caught a chill at the weekend playing cricket. Yes, I played cricket. A game with 88 pages of rules and annexes was perfect for me. - Are we still going for a Thai? - I'm going home. Me too. We always go for a Thai afterwards! It took a lot to make me change my mind. I didn't mind being by myself. Quite the opposite. The alignment of the planets was against me that day. - Where were you this morning? - I was sick all night. I didn't sleep. I took a pill which knocked me out. I couldn't read the instructions. My eyes were bleary. How can you read the print when your eyes are bleary? They make singing birthday cards, why not talking instructions? - You haven't heard? Heard what? "Intimately amputated." Nine letters. You don't seem bothered. I handle stress my own way. Some people cry. I do crosswords. I'll stop, if it'll help. Not heard what? They called us all together this morning. Longchamps was there with all the managers. He said the factory wasn't profitable, and was being moved abroad. But we're really busy. I'm going on a course in a month's time. They didn't say when it would close, but we'll all be sacked. They can't do that. "Castrated". That's it. Castrated. They could have said "emasculated". The people who do these are sneaky. Marcelle did crosswords. My way of relaxing was to check. And check again. Two, three, four, five times. Ever since I was a kid, I'd hated the unexpected. It's because of my mother. Lola was the only fire-breathing striptease artist in Europe. She wasn't very good at either, but she found really seedy places to work. Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum! This is the last time, darling. I promise. That's when I stopped believing what she said. - What's this? - It's for work. I realised I had to deal with things. For as long as I can remember, I wanted to escape. I paid for the room, I decide what I do in it. Never underestimate yourself. As soon as I could, I left Lola and started work. If I were to ask you to make three copies... You put in 333 copies, 3 times. I finally found a job suited to my skills. The accelerometer has gone. The crash lab was the only place I liked. The accelerometer has gone. Start the checking procedure. I need replacement connections. I loved my job. I caused accidents, crash tests. - She's nuts. - Yes. She's the best technician we've ever had. Acceleration in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5... Stop the procedure. The management say we're to stop all activity. Should you be eating those in front of people? I didn't have lunch. How can you do this job all year long? You get used to it. The collective agreement means we're legally obliged to offer you a job in the new factory. We have to offer, but we know you won't go to India. - It's in India? - Unfortunately. - Which town? - Somewhere unpronounceable. The point of this meeting is to look at solutions for the future. I can assure you we have great retraining programmes, which will enable you to seize new challenges. I don't want a new challenge. Did you read the working conditions in India? You've been looking at it for five minutes... Your new salary, in line with the Indian market. - That's impossible. - There's no health cover, and you work 48 hours a week. - Do I get the same job? - Yes, probably. "Yes" or "probably"? An equivalent job in the crash department. We have a lot of people to see. I want to keep my job. - You want to relocate to India? - Yes. Don't you want to think about it? No. - Is India a good place to live? - My family is Sri Lankan. I'm going to live there. - Why would you do that? - They have cricket leagues. I'm not improving here. You're going to India to play cricket? Among other things. I'd had enough. I don't hang about once I've made up my mind. Things were bad at the factory. Aglaé! Where are you going? - I'm going to sign my contract. - Really? I've made up my mind. - You're signing this one? - No. That's the refusal. I didn't sign it, they weren't happy. - I have to go. - I'll come with you. Not you as well? - I'm not staying here. - I'm off. - So much for solidarity. - Am I into solidarity? That's Marcelle. That stubborn woman had looked forward to retiring since she was 24. Her job let her buy quality cleaning products and go on all-inclusive group holidays in warm countries. So why not India? Marcelle wouldn't have gone alone. But with me, it was like a group holiday. How can you make such an offer? It was made to be refused. - Is it negotiable? - We can offer less. You bastard. - Why are you here? - They're my colleagues. Gentlemen, ladies... Yes? - What are you doing? - They're signing their contracts. The lady wants a job in our factory in India. What is all this? We're in a meeting. You're being held in this room indefinitely. - Is that the best you can do? - Stop the relocation. Could you come back when we've finished? Why is she winding me up? You represent them. I'm not negotiating working conditions in India. - You're supporting the relocation. - I'm keeping my job. Whole families work here. They can't go to India. It may amuse you, but people have families here. - Unbelievable. You're talking about family obligations? Everyone knew Clovis had been dumped by Liette. She wanted a child, but Clovis wanted a better labour agreement first. Unfair terms! I gave you this for your 40th. Liette wasn't interested in union activities, until she found a document from Human Resources. That day, Clovis found his things in the garden. If you want to help your colleagues, tell them not to sign. Shut up. Can we remain polite? You know she slept with him? - I've got the film at home. - This is no way to negotiate. You worry about Aglaé and Marcelle. Anne-Sophie is right. They should refuse. I don't care about Anne-Sophie. I'm going to India too. Are you doing this just to piss me off? I think it'll do me good. I'll print the contract. Don't do this. Hello, Lola. It's your daughter. I'm going to work in India. I thought you might want to see me before I go. I need my big suitcase. I know that after two years you consider a loan to be a gift. Aglaé, it's Liette. Call me. Liette again. I've had a letter. They won't pay the air fares. Call me. I've spoken to Marcelle. We need to meet. I can't afford to move to India on that salary. The decision came from the top. Why are they doing this? They don't want to appear to support you. - It gives the wrong image. - Wrong image? - They're sacking us. - What do we do? Given the circumstances, I don't really care. I'm keeping my job, even if I have to walk there. Who are you threatening? - I've got a car. - What? I've got a car. We can go by car. - Can you do that? - Why not? - We can't drive to India. - You were going to walk. - We can go camping. - I want to go to work. I wasn't going to give up before I'd even left. I wasn't great at geography, but I wanted to plan a route. Since the closure, I didn't feel in control. How hard could it be to get to India? - Why are the wipers going? - It doesn't work. Did you go to the garage? It's not worth it just for windscreen wipers. We're going quite a long way. I'm not sure I'm up for a car journey to India. I don't think it's a good idea. - I'll drop you at the station. - What? If you want to go back, I'll drop you at the station. No, no. I was just talking. I'd never do this by myself. I prefer the plane. We shouldn't be negotiating with no-hopers in France. - But him. - Fürstenberg? Yes, "Fürstenberk". We should be at work. But we're stuck behind a tractor. - Shall we go and see him? - We're not doing that. He might take pity on us. - He lives in Switzerland. - No detours. A small detour. We're staying with a family in Frankfurt tonight. - We'll go to a campsite. - I don't want to go camping! Surely we can have some fun? And going to see Fürstenberg would be fun? I like the idea. Who wants to go see Fürstenberg? Come on, then. I don't feel well. He'll slow down. - Aglaé? - You don't want a detour, but we won't get there any quicker if you throw up. We hadn't crossed the border, and I already regretted taking them with me. I should have gone on my own. I've given her something for the nausea. Give her 2 days and she'll call her parents. She never mentions her family. We don't really know each other. - You came to my wedding. - You don't choose your colleagues or your family. Mr Fürstenberg Are you the nurse? Er... Yes. About time! Shall we wake her? Once we have the plane tickets. - Start! - Start! Start the car! Go! - What's wrong with him? - He fainted. Is he alive? I thought he'd be nicer. - Where are we going? - The hospital. I don't know where it is. In the home of the Red Cross, we'll find one. I'll fetch a wheelchair. I need to go for a pee. - Don't leave me on my own. - You'll be fine. Where am I? You fainted. What? I think you fainted. - Are you the nurse? - No. Who are you? My name is Aglaé. I work in one of your factories. What do you want? My colleagues wanted to see you. - Is this a kidnapping? - No. - Are you armed? - No. You're relocating us to India. They wanted to discuss it. This isn't a kidnapping. They've gone to get you a wheelchair. Do I look like a man who takes orders? See you soon, Aglaé. Where's Fürstenberg? Fürstenberg! Fürstenberg! This isn't good. - Shall we stop? I'm hungry. - No. - Why not? - We should be in Frankfurt. - Are we on a schedule? - Yes. We won't get to India otherwise! It's going to be a long journey. Marcelle was right. The chicken tandoori was a long way off. Is that it? It was nicer before. Did you hurt yourself? Spencer? What a tip. Let me do it. The dog... Have you eaten? No. Come in, then. Sigrun's welcome matched my surprise visit, as warm as her frozen dinners. - Will Spencer be home soon? - He's not coming home. Why not? He has a new life, and I'm not in it. He was useless anyway. Did he mow the lawn? - Where's he living? - I don't know. - I'd like to talk to him. - I don't have his number. How will I find him? Didn't he call? No! You could have told him to call me. I can't always remind him to call me! Who is Spencer? Aglaé's father. - Are you her mother? - No. Aglaé is a bastard. Do you say that, "a bastard"? Bastard. It was thanks to Sigrun I sometimes saw my father. He was a GI on a base in Germany. He married Sigrun when she was expecting the twins, Tom and Gunther. It was at an exotic show in Baden-Baden that Spencer met my mother. I didn't see him often as a child. But despite that, I liked the idiot. Enough to learn English for him. What? - Is that baseball? - Cricket. - Is it good? - I find it relaxing. You'll see your father another time. I doubt it. - You have something to prove? - No. It's not like you and Clovis. I didn't want him to lose touch. It's my fault. I should have known he'd leave one day. Are you OK? You were right. I've waited 15 years to have a child with Clovis. And now the clock's ticking, I'm off to India. It's stupid. You still look fertile to me. I'm an idiot. Did you come to cheer me up? Yes. You don't say much. I was waiting for the right moment. Your German's not bad. Yes, not bad. I'm a surprising woman. A bit like you. I may lack affection, but if I wanted a pet to stroke, I'd have chosen a panda, not a dog with wrinkled skin. I like your temperament. It matches your look. The dress, the glasses, the boots. It's impetuous and bold. I like that. I have only two guest beds. How awkward. What are you doing? What? What are you doing? Strimming. The grass is too long to mow. We're leaving after breakfast. I think I'll stay here. You can't stay here. Sigrun suggested it. - When? - Last night. What the hell is going on? You won't find better than this. Thanks a lot. Enjoy. What's going on with Sigrun? I'm finding happiness where I can. - Really? With her step-mother? - She's not my step-mother. You can't decide overnight. I saw photos of Spencer. I'd prefer him, but at my age I can't be choosy. I'm not going to quibble over a pizzle. - What about your job? - This wasn't about my job. Once you've mown the lawn, what then? There's enough to keep me busy until I retire. We don't have a car. You can have my car. - Really? - I know how much you care about your crap job. - It's not a crap job. - Whatever. - It's not a crap job. - You could thank me for the car. Thank you. There you go. We had a laugh, anyway. Imagining Marcelle replacing my father was rather disturbing. We were going to miss her. Especially Liette. Hello? Yes. We're in Poland. Where? I don't know. That's a big detour. I'm listening. Do you speak French? Does this look like a French restaurant? - Mojito. - And a mojito. I'll ask her. Yes. That's right. Who was that? A factory manager. What did he want? To meet us. Where? We're in Poland. I hate detours. Hello. My name is Uliana Bankoske. Did you have a good trip? Please sit down. Is she a ballerina? Sorry about the mess. We're redecorating. - It looks nice. - There's an organic restaurant, a gym, swimming pool, games room... It's great. - And a crèche for my 2 children. - Two? 2 and 3 months. Can we work here? No. You're too old. She could. If she improved her skills. - I don't want to work here. - How did you get hired? I applied after doing my Sociology masters, and I had to learn French, over the summer. - Why are we here? - Mr Longchamps asked us to organise a meeting with a manager. He should be here soon. Fürstenberg? - What? - On the wall. Yes, when the factory opened. Have you met him? I forgot: we have a spa, with showers. Pity I'm old and useless. I'd work here. You should. It's good to have a change. You've always done quality control. Look where it got me. I'm not sure we'll make it there by car. When we got the car out of the mud, I thought we'd make it. Are you serious? We'll make it, together. Hello, Aglaé. Hello, Liette. - Where's Marcelle? - She abandoned us in Germany. Did you know he was coming? - I've negotiated your return. - To the factory? The factory's finished. Customer service in Mulhouse. Better conditions than at the factory. They're doing you a favour. Right! Clovis had used the situation to his advantage. No. Our hands are tied. They want to see Fürstenberg. The managers are the violent ones! Disappeared? Are you taking the piss? The workers want due respect! I'm not falling for that! Not me. We'll be in touch. That they're useful. We need them. I've had enough. Now it's every man for himself. Clovis had had enough too. He missed Liette. The two men made a secret deal. Longchamps would get us jobs in France in exchange for getting out of the meeting room. I'm sorry. I've no excuse. Except maybe being overworked. I even miss those stupid things in your hair. Have you been home? You redecorated. Don't. I look awful. You look more lovely than ever. I've never seen you in a jacket before. Do you still want a child? - No! - What's wrong with the contract? It's not the contract. I can't work in an office. If I can, you can. You haven't seen me use a photocopier. - Give yourself a chance. - I am. - In what way? - If I make it, I'll prove I deserve to have my job. - You've nothing to prove. - You're giving up when we're nearly there. - Sorry, but you're not even halfway. - You can't do it alone. So come with me, then. Then you can go back to France. I saw your route. It's a straight line. I'm not changing my mind because you got felt up. I want to have a child. Have 20 for all I care. You don't know what it will be like. Have you spoken to anyone? I've looked after myself since I was 10. I understand. Watch the DVD of Clovis and you'll know how I feel! I don't want us to part like this. I'm worried about you. Killing blondes might be legal where you're going. What can I say to make you change your mind? I know this detour was for me. You're worth more than you think. Will you call me? I'll call you when I get there. I wasn't keen on the idea of doing the journey alone. But maybe it wasn't so bad. I could do what I wanted, which was great. No more detours, or CEOs, fathers or husbands to see, and nothing unexpected. Do you need help? I don't like how she looks at me. You say that about everyone. - What's that? - She's going to India. We shouldn't have picked her up. - Is she going to see the elephants? - I don't know. What? She does crash tests on cars. Yes, so I saw. I'm an artist. I draw my own borders. Your documents. Open the boot. Isn't Filip here today? He's off sick. What's this? An old wig... full of lice. What do you do with it all? We do all kinds of shows, corporate events. We have a wedding tonight. You're artists? I was a singer in a previous life. On a starry night, lit by the moon... I've forgotten some. I'm too old for this crap. Darling, I'll take you home Carrying you in my arms End of the road. I don't understand. Can you teach us to play? Thank you. Tell her. I wasn't doing so badly. Daria was right. Maybe I was more adventurous than I thought. I just had to keep going. Stay on track. Persevere, like in cricket. Like at work. To make sure everything went OK. I had to do whatever it took. It's easier to catch a chicken. Lieutenant! - What do I do with her? - She has a passport. Aslanov! It's too late to take her to the police. Lock her in the boiler room. The boiler room? There are rats in there. It's the only place with a lock. She won't escape from here. Idiot! It's not to stop her escaping, but to keep the men off her. I want no trouble, OK? I can control myself. I'm worried about you, not her. One out of any ten soldiers is always an idiot. Come in. Make yourself comfortable. Wake up. Are you hungry? "Eat." Eat? "Tra...vel." Travel? No. Work. "Lovely." "Magnificent." Magnificent. My motorcycle. Travel. You must return to France. Travel... magnificent. - Hello? - Liette? Liette, it's Aglaé. Aglaé? Where are you? Are you there? I'm in the middle of the desert. There are soldiers. Aglaé... Where was I? I had no idea. I took the only road there was. I never thought I'd get so far on this journey. Come on! I wasn't someone who protested, who locked up managers, burned tyres or stood up for their rights. I'd rather take a crap job in India than re-evaluate things. That's why I was there. That's why I kept going. Is she dead? I don't know. Don't the bikes work? I'm busy. We found her by the roadside. Good God... - Is she alive? - I don't know. Get rid of it! We haven't spoken or seen each other. Get out! Damn kids! Hello? Liette? Liette, it's Aglaé. Aglaé? Where are you? Are you there? I'm in the middle of the desert. There are soldiers. Aglaé? Since my call from the army base in Kazakhstan, Liette feared the worst. She organised a campaign to find me. If we don't find her now... Fürstenberg was easier to find. My disappearance made me a symbol of relocation. The company was held responsible for my journey, which affected its share price. Shit! For once, an employee mattered. Come and help me. But they needed to hurry to find me. One of the only things still valid was the visa on my passport. I've lost my finger. I'm hallucinating. I'm hallucinating. - Hello? - Aglaé? - Liette? - Aglaé, is that you? - It's good to hear your voice. - You too. - Where did you go? - I got lost. You were right not to give up. They're not closing the factory. You can come home. Are you pleased? I think so. Are you sure? Yes. Where's the sugar? Under your nose. She's more neurotic than you. I adore her. She makes me feel almost normal. - We sent a car for you. - What are you doing in India? - I'm here to prevent more trouble. - What trouble? We're still opening in India. We're closing in the Netherlands. - The air fare would've been cheaper. - It was an industrial accident. I've got some clothes for your press conference. What press conference? You created this mess. Play the game. - I don't want to play. - Pity. You could have my job if you wanted. I don't want it. I should thank you for saving my job. Thanks to you, I get to work with all the people I fired, my bosses think I'm a slut... You're welcome. Do it for your colleagues at least. Try to live up to the cause. Or it won't have been worth losing a finger. - I'm going to be sick. - Not now. Coming? Can I stay here a moment? I'll wait for you. My name is Aglaé, and I finally left my job. How did it come to this? No doubt due to my iron will, and my stubbornness. I had more in common with a transgender Indian than my neighbour, and a Kazakh soldier got me pregnant. Maybe that's globalisation.
