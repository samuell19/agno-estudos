Okay, here we are. 12 miles down Rural Route 2 i Anole, West Virginia. It's four hours and 12 minutes - - from Washington, D.C. It's a little further out, than I remember. I've only been here once before in daylight. I expect to see the house, but it has not happened yet. But I see electricity master, so that's a good sign. It shouldn't be much longer. Now I risk sounding complacent, but I've heard - - people talk about leaving Washington, D.C., get away from the city. Get away from the people, and the terrible traffic and - - the ugly people and the car horns and the furious pace. For the 20 years I've lived in D.C., - I don't remember anyone that has actually gotten away. But I do now. I think I'll stop the camera - - until I have a better idea, where I am. 8 miles down Rural Route 2 - - and the dream house has emerged. If we can see it. There it is! Seven acres full of forest. It's over with people, no more noise - - no more drunken cries from the neighbors. There will be nothing. The place is solid. It was built by an experienced builder - - as I was told, also came from D.C. But the place was for sale for almost 18 months. Probably because the closest grocery store, gas station - - Almost everything, is 35 minutes away in Webster Springs. It's just too remote for most people. But for a technical editor, who just need - - a slow satellite Internet connection to work with - - then it's not too distant. So, Claire, David, Kim, Lauren, Marcy, Tom, - - everyone in our small OCD group, I did it. I've escaped from Washington D.C. We should all do that. It's going to be good for me. No one will bother me. And I don't want to upset anyone. Not quite out here. The time is soon 01:00. Look at this... I did it! I did it! I may have scared some small animals, but that's the worst. But... I am so tired. I'll probably just - - take a bath and go to bed. The relocators come sometime tomorrow morning. I'm going to miss you all I will miss you all, but I will come back once in a while. In the meantime, you have these video updates. I hope, You are happy on my behalf and ... ... until the next chapter in my little adventure - - I say good night. Hi every one. Sorry, because I've been around a bit dull with my video updates. That Sunday, I've been here four days now. The relocators have come and gone. But in my defense, I've been working 18 hours a day - - to make this video reveal as perfect as possible. So let's get started. Before we get started, - I want to tell everyone, how incredibly quiet here is. I'm used to constant sounds, that in the absence of sound - - ring it in my ears. I stop talking and listen once, how quiet here is. There is nothing. You have to get used to that. Yesterday I woke up to the sound of the wind blowing. It was almost ... Don't get me wrong, I love it. But I just have to get used to the thought about being alone here. After living in the city so long, it will take some time. Let's continue the tour. This is the basement. You can see that the basement is bigger than my old apartment. The satellite internet technician came yesterday, so now i have satellite internet - - and probably a thousand channels, which I will never see. The house slopes on a hill, saw this page - - is a little underground. Where this site, opens out to the ground floor. There is the garage you can see the roof. I have a nice fireplace down here. There is a bathroom downstairs. There is a storage room on the lower left, where I still have a lot of boxes - - which I have not yet unpacked. To the right is the boiler room. Everything is in place as you can see. I have been busy. And it's nice here. The tour continues upstairs. On to the next floor. This room is very spacious Nice high ceiling. Hardwood floors. There is a really large terrace. There is the garage again. There is also a fireplace on this floor. A dining table and so on. Here is the kitchen. I finally have a gas stove, which I have always wanted. Below we have two guest rooms and a separate bathroom - - to you who have promised to come and visit me ... ... Claire. Those who come to visit will stay comfortable and I have decided the space. Let's continue upstairs to the third floor. We have a handrail, and here's my little workplace. Everything I need. I can work just as easily here, as in D.C. The internet is a little slower, but it will be enough. If we continue this path, here is the large bathroom - - and the master bedroom. Very fine. This window faces directly to the north. But nothing but peace and quiet and solitude - - for several kilometers. I know what I forgot to show. Here is my screened porch. Where you can enjoy the outdoors facilities without insects. Isn't that nice? The best neighbors ... ... are no neighbors. The tour continues outside. This is my side garden. As you can see, opens the basement doors here to. I've mowed the grass for the first time in 26 years. Even with 6 acres, the lawn is a small part, - so it didn't take me long. But in the garage - - I found this little beauty. Wherever the owners went, then they don't need it anymore. I wanted to prove to everyone, that I can survive the winter. That I'll probably handle it. To everyone in the group - - this is for you See! I'll do it. Hey, I just got back from the Webster Springs Post Office, - and I received your very nice cards. I saw that you had posted it last week. But I probably only take to Webster Springs - - to check my mail once a week. Unless it's important, because it's a bit of a ride. But this means a lot to me. Claire and David, you couldn't come on other than "The Best Greetings"? No, I really appreciate on this lovely gesture. It would be on my desk, while I work. I should come back too. I'm working on a white paper to the Ministry of Transport, - - which is a bit ironic, as I now live on an unpaved dirt road. But everything is fine, the work goes well, and even with my increased intake - - of Venlafaxine to 375 milligrams. I found out, that I have to drive back to D.C. - - September 6, to meet with a client that afternoon. Which, thankfully, is a Thursday night. See you at the meeting that night. I can't wait and thank you. Much appreciated. Until next time... This is a scheduled update - - turned into an unexpected update. I'm about 2.5 miles from the house. I have walked directly NO and I added the house as a GPS waypoint, - - otherwise, I know, that I could never find again. But the plan was to hike one couple of hours and have lunch. And then make an update, - which I could send to everyone when I came home again. But I’m filming now because I was bumping on something that I wanted to share with you. Something I absolutely cannot explain. On this tree. I'm almost sure, that it's a skull from a cat. With the letter "B", or maybe the number 8 just above .. I will not give you ant creep, but so ... I have no explanation for that. I thought, though this - - was anyone's pet, what kind of tribute is that? Apart from that - - I've looked at Google maps and nothing is near my house. Who else is out here? It makes me think, if I continue, I will encounter - - a farmer's camp, Or something like that. I thought about removing it, but I leave it enough and move on. But if you find my phone in a year without a trace of me - - it's safe to say, that I encountered a group of people. And maybe my own skull on a tree somewhere around here. I ended up hiking another 40 minutes and then nothing unusual. I saw a fox, about 20 meters away, - but it ran off when it saw me, and did not stop until it was out of sight. But it was beautiful. If it didn't run off, had I given it a little of my sandwich. I've been thinking about what I saw and ... ... it's probably been there for a long time, so I don't want to think too much about it. It's incredibly random, that I came across it, - but other than that, it doesn't really affect me. People do weird things, and my house is still far from that place. So it really doesn't matter. But things are going well and I still am glad I moved out here. As you know, I'm back on the 6th and 7th, less than two ... I have no idea what it was, but I don't see anything, so ... It is enough... As I said, I'll be back in less than two weeks. I look forward to seeing everyone, so ... They come with more updates, so until next time ... Hi, I'm about to go to bed, but I wanted to reassure everyone, - that I came home safely from the hike. I didn't see or hear anything other strange on the way back. I didn't even see the skull on its way back. I'm in the bedroom and I just want to show you - - the contrast between here and D.C. It's Saturday night and my window is open. Ready? I know you don't really can see anything but ... The contrast between here and D.C. Okay Goodnight. It's 04.22 on Monday morning, and I probably look a little tired. I was trying to sleep with the bedroom window open for the first time tonight - - and it turned out that be a big mistake. About an hour ago, I was awakened from a deep sleep, - of a terribly expensive scream outside my window. I didn't know what it was. I thought it was a person screaming. It really scared me. I would love to pretend otherwise, but it really scared me. I would not be able to sleep again. So I've been on the internet and listened to various animal sounds. It includes about 20 owl species. Reckless, lean, cats, badger, - - foxes, skunks, rabbits ... But nothing sounded like what I remember having heard outside the window - - when I was half asleep and I changed probably the sound in my head. I have no idea what it was. I just know, that I will never hear it again. I think this is the first time, I've recorded two updates in one day. This is a practical little thing, I use to record interviews. But it is very sensitive. It records in high quality all night - - on the internal memory. So I figured, that I could put it in the windowsill - - to record all night. I close the window - - so I won't be awakened by anything tonight. Such. Tomorrow I import the audio file for my computer - - and see if there could be the expensive ones screams that I heard last night. Not just for my sake, I want everyone hears the sounds that woke me up. It records. The time is exactly 23:00, so ... ... good night. Good morning, I'm right imported the audio file from last night - - into my computer. I wanted to review it with you guys, to see if we caught any - - creepy expensive sounds in the wee night hours. I didn't hear anything myself, but again, the window was closed. Maybe the recorder has caught something I didn't hear. But we switch to monitor view. Here's the recording. It looks flat, which you would expect. I guess, that it's just mutton and cicadas. This fluctuation in the beginning must be then I set it and started recording. Closes the window, - so I won't be awakened by anything tonight. Of course. Here's a fluctuation right away. 48 minutes inside. It's just a plane. Flying to and from more exciting places than Anole, West Virginia. Continue. Another slight fluctuation. Another plane. Okay, I'll move on. Here's something. One hour and 55 minutes inside. Cool. Owls talking to each other. That's not what I heard, but it's still pretty creepy. There are eerie things in the woods at night. Looking forward. There are a few small fluctuations. So around ... Two hours and 54 minutes inside the recording. It's nothing. Several sheep chickens and cicadas. Four hours inside. Here's a fluctuation. Four hours and ... ... about 30 minutes, four hours and 31 minutes inside. It doesn't sound like an animal. Sounds like a person. Four hours and 31 minutes. It would be about 3:30. I zoom in a bit. Sounds like a person! As if saying "Why." "Why" or "Who are you?" Is it an animal or a person? It's like somebody there hitting something against a tree. Please wait. Wait a second. I went out and looked around my bedroom window. I didn't see any signs of - - there has been someone out there, not that I expected it. To me it does not sound sometime like an animal. Sounds like a person. Please wait. I listened to the rest of the recording and there was nothing else unusual. The only other sounds - - throughout the recording, was over - - when the birds started singing. And the sound of me, that opens the window and takes the recorder. But... But I don't let my imagination run wild. Based on what I heard. I'll try again tonight, and see if I - - recording something strange, which I do not believe. The good news is, that in two days I drive back to D.C. - - and I'm all looking forward to that meeting. I look forward to seeing everyone again. Okay. Until next time... Good morning. That's the countdown for my visit to D.C. In less than 24 hours, I will be on your way to you. But I recorded again last night and thought I would listen - - as part of the last update, which I'll post later today. Then you will not hear from me again, until we see you tomorrow night. Let's take a look. It looks pretty flat, as it did last night. The small fluctuation, when I started recording. Closes the window. I started exactly pm. 23:00 again last night. So everything is staggered for an hour. Here is... ... we are an hour and 10 minutes in, so it would be 00:10. Only mutton chickens. There's not really anything. Here are two hours and six minutes. Then it is 1:06. Nothing. I see if I can find anything. Nothing. It's three hours inside. Here are some fluctuations. Kl. 3:36, which would be 02:36. I zoom in a bit. What is it? The same sound as last night. Who beats someone a tree - - with a baseball bat. And it sounds ... ... much closer. What is it? It's not an animal. Someone is hitting a tree. I see nothing else. Four hours inside. Five hours inside. This is towards the end of the recording, and it's probably just birds. Yes. This is just before, I stopped recording. Nothing before, I open the window. I never thought I should say that, but I'm probably enjoying it - - to return to D.C. a single day. See you tomorrow night, I really look forward to it. If anyone would like to a little sushi first, so call me. I'll see you tomorrow. Hi Claire. I wanted to tell you that I mostly - - avoided early Friday traffic I just got home. This is out on my patio. Isn't it beautiful? I would also tell, that I thought of you. I've been in a good mood ever since Thursday night. This update is for you only, nobody in the group needs to know - - maybe we got a couple drinks too much Thursday - - after the meeting, and that you would come and visit me tomorrow! It will be nice with a little company, especially when it is you. I really can't wait to show you my new house. My haunted new house. No, everything is just as I left it, no stacked chairs in the kitchen. Nothing inexplicable to find, when I came home. If you have problems with the road, - - If you have questions, so call me on my landline. Because the mobile signal is pretty bad in this area, - - then drive carefully tomorrow, and I can't wait to see you. Okay. Until then. Goodbye. Such! She's here, Claire's here. Finally. First visitor in my remote West Virginia mansion has arrived! Welcome! - You really live in the desert - I know. I said it was a long drive. Do you have a suitcase or something, can i carry in? I actually need your bathroom. Are you going to film? I just want to record a welcome hug. Mark, do you mind switching off, please? I don't want to annoy you. I'll give you the big tour of the house. And I turn off the camera first. It's been a good day hiking, cooking and wine. Here is the lovely but tired Claire, who insists on his own room. Even in my haunted house. I promise I will not send this to someone in the group, it's only for my own ... ... afterwards? Does it make sense? I'm a word-smith. Claire actually wants to hear some of them scary sounds that have plagued me. So she has opened the window. So just come on because Claire is not scared. I was, but ... She is not. I know she's ready to sleep, because she has made the pillow clear. Perfectly centered and perpendicular to the main yeast. Say, if you need anything. Sleep well, my dear. Good night. At 03:04, and Claire just woke me up after ... Listen! What is it? - I'll get a flashlight. - Wait! Listen. Someone is chopping a tree. Claire, no one lives for 10 km. distance. That is it! Listen! Sounds like that. Who cuts trees at 3:00? A person with an ax. Oh God! I have a gun! - Do you have? - No! My Goodness! - I can't stay here. - You can't leave now! Mark, turn it off! To drive down one dirt road in the middle of the night ... It took two valium, but Claire finally fell asleep. She realized driving away in the middle the night was foolish. It was very strange and eerie, but it should not ruin everything. And I hope we can laugh of this over breakfast - - and still enjoy our weekend together. This should show you, that you overreacted last night, - but you were right it was someone who carved a tree. About 60 meters from the house. Yes, very creepy. But it wasn't because, we were threatened or something, - and it doesn't make sense to leave me, like the first thing in the morning You didn't let me touch you anyway. I figured watching beer cans around around, but there are only wood remains. What is this. What the hell is this? Hi Claire. I just wanted to tell you, that after you left this morning, - I walked around the area, and it turns out you were right. Someone cut a tree. Only about 60 meters from the bedroom window. Hanging from the felled tree - - I found this. A cheap medallion, where it says "My heart is yours." I opened it up and it shows say there is a small clock. And the clock stopped exactly at 3:04. Which is around the time, we heard those sounds. I called Tomere County the sheriff half an hour ago. He said I shouldn't worry to me, it was probably nothing. Probably just a bucket from a neighboring town. I told him about the medallion. He told me, that maybe the girlfriend had left him - - and maybe threw the medallion away after reacting a bit. He asked me to call again, if anything strange happened. It seemed like a logical explanation. I'm sorry you felt, that you had to leave. So I guess, that things have returned to the old - - from before I visited D.C. And it's up to you ... ... how you want to continue things. In the meantime, I'll post updates for the entire group. I hope you did well and had - - a good trip back home I hope that - - we'll talk again soon. Good Monday morning. I hope everyone is doing well. I heard some strange noises outside my window this weekend - - so I set the recorder in the windowsill again I think if the drunkards think, that my property is a place to party. Or to harass the guy from the city is entertaining. Then I have to keep track on these incidents when they happen. So... I put the file on my computer, let's see if I got something. I started recording at midnight, so the time is right - - with time at night. So... This would be 1am, one hour inside. Crickets. I only stop if I see something. Here is an hour and 25 minutes inside. One hour and 45 minutes inside. Here's something. At one hour and 52 minutes. A plane. An airplane and an owl. Just an owl this time. A lonely owl in the middle of the forest. I know how it is. Cool. It's two hours inside. 2:45. Three hours inside. Here is a slight fluctuation of ... ... at. 3:11. Music? Music? 03:11 at night. It's a flute. Someone is playing a flute outside my window. And that's it. Nothing else. It just stops there. I don't see any other fluctuations. What... Please wait. We look for something else. It's five hours inside It was 3:11. A whistle outside the window. Here are things at 6:00, but it's probably just ... ... birds, as usual. Okay, okay. Please wait. I just went for a lap the area outside my window - - and a little up the hill. I saw no sign of that there was someone out there last night. If it is completely rich - - then they are the most conscientious, I have ever seen. It didn't sound like full-on. Which drunkard plays the flute? And plays well. I don't know ... I'll send everyone an update later today if I can. Hi every one, guess what i did today? I stayed free this morning - - and I drove an hour and 15 minutes, each way to Sutton, West Virginia, And I bought one "Do-not-fool-of-me-drunk" tool. In other words... Now I know, that some of you get nervous, - especially you Marcy. But I feel right. I have 375 mg. Venlafaxine in me. As you all have heard of the tapes, - these are not auditory hallucinations. So I feel this is a necessity piece of equipment at this point. But let's give it a try. Contrary to what I do told the guy in the store, - I never shot a gun, but I read the instructions, so ... I'll give it a try. Okay. Here we go. Fuse, fuse, fuse. Thats how it should be! Right on target! Not right in the middle, but pretty close! First shot! Stay away from my house, fools! I've already put the recording off last night at the computer and heard it. And I want to show everyone what I found. Here is the file. There is virtually nothing on the recording - - except at the same time, like two nights ago. Kl. 3:11. This is at 3:11 and 55 seconds. And there is not really second the rest of the night. And as soon as I heard this - - I went back and listened the recording from two nights ago. And to me it sounded like the same piece of music. Now you see what I did. I switch to multi-track view. This top file, - - right here, is the recording from two nights ago And the bottom is the shooting from last night. According to the time of this recording, the two nights ago, - - I started recording exactly at. 00:00 and eight seconds. And for the file below, last night, - I started exactly pm. 00:00 and 24 seconds. It's a difference of 16 seconds, and I show what I did. When you move the recording from last night back - - exactly 16 seconds, to correct that displacement, - - this is what you get. You will hear the mutton double, because it plays both files. The one from two nights ago, and the one from last night will be played at the same time. Here's what you hear: This is at 3:11 and 21 seconds: It's a simple piece music, perfectly divided, - - over two separate nights. I don't know how they could have timed it so well. For fractions of a second. I've decided. I'm not making a recording, I want to listen to it live. Around. 3:11. I film it and do it part of the next update. And don't worry about me, I'm armed now, so ... If at last - - then you have to worry about those who are out there. The time is 03:09. As you can probably guess, I haven't slept. According to the displacement of the audio files - - began to whistle the sound, I've heard two nights in a row - - at. 03:10 and 52 seconds. I record this in infrared, so I can't even see right now. But more important, if any out there, they can't look inside either. I also have this one, if I need to. It is approx. 20 seconds again, - - so I'm quiet and listening for the whistle Hello? Hello? The phone rang at. 3:10 and 52. There was no one on the line. Wait a second. I tried to call * 69, - - and it gave me the number of an FAA office, who called from D.C. earlier today. So the last call was not ... Who's out there? I have some good ones updates for you today. I haven't gotten any sleep. You heard what I heard last night. I didn't want to sleep. I left the house at. 06:30 and drove to Sutton again - - to the same hunting and sports business. I thought they opened at. 8 but they did not open until 10. This is why I left. It's a motion-activated, infrared hunting camera. Hunting, as in deer, bears ... - coyotes, squirrels and what than there are nearby. I had a very memorable one conversation with the owner of the store. When I said I had just moved to Anole, he knew well what house. Because his sister-in-law and theirs five children also live in Anole. She had told of the old man husband and his schizophrenic daughter - - living 9 km. down Rural Route 2 in Anole. Until the old man's sister who is worried about not hearing from him - - came to the house and found him hanging from a tree. And the daughter? She is still missing. Supposed to be horizontal into the woods and died. I called mine real estate agent on the way back - - and not surprisingly she played totally ignorant. She said another broker had told that the house was sold - - due to family deaths. So, in a way, she did not deny it. I think, I've got it under control .. It is motion controlled and takes one picture, if something comes into the field of view. And it has an infrared lamp. So it should - - take pictures at night, as it was in daylight. Turn it on. Sets it to take images in a series of three. High sensitivity. I point it in the direction, where I've heard most - - the sounds come from, outside my bedroom window. Hopefully I get pictures of those who have created problems. But I wonder, which tree the old man was hanging from. Is there anybody, who want to visit me? There was something else that I wanted parts i'm in the garage. A little while, I moved in, I cleaned out the basement fireplace - - and I found this. I didn't think about it, I just threw it away. But since I haven't been to the landfill, I found it in the trash again. I don't know if you can see the date. But this picture is from November, 1973. I wonder, whether this was the man's daughter? I do not know, who else it should be. Or why someone tried to burn it. I went out to get the camera, and it's gone. Someone took it from the tree during the night. It seems, that they cut the strap - - with a kind of blade. And lifted everything apart. I can not believe it. We go inside again. The sheriff said I should call, if something happened - - and then things are gone strange sounds of theft - - I would say it is needed. I have this earpiece, which can absorb - - so you can listen and I do that part of the update. Tomer County sheriff. Hello, Mr. Bishop? It's me. Hello, Mr. Bishop. My name is Mark Klein, - you may remember, that I spoke to you a week ago. I bought the house Rural Route 2 in Anole. I called and said, that I had heard strange sounds - - outside my window at night? Yes, the guy from D.C. Exactly. I bought one of the infrared, motion-activated hunting cameras. I set it up straight away for my house last night - - and looked at it, but now it's gone. Someone has stolen it. Someone stole your hunting camera? Yes, last night. Did you put a cable lock on it? Jess, I said, I don't eat those onion bagels! No, I don't have a cable lock. I have 6 acres - - in the middle of nothing, why should I lock it? I know people who have 400 acres and still lock their hunting cameras Hunters come past them all the time If they didn't lock, it ends up with someone stealing them I don't like either cream cheese with chives Sir. Bishop ... Sir. Bishop, this has nothing to do with hunters. It was 20 meters from my house, I set it up right outside - - my bedroom window. Someone stole it right outside the window. Why do you place a hunting camera outside your bedroom window? Do you remember I called last week - - and I said I heard strange sounds outside my window, - - people... Like there were people outside my house, and I should call if there was anything else. Go back and get ordinary bagels, plain cream cheese Hello?! - Hello? - What was your name? Mark Klein? Mr. Klein. If there is no damage to your property, - and haven't seen any illegal intrusion, - then I recommend, that you lock your hunting camera My brother had a lock stuck at his deer camp - And somebody was still cutting cable and took it So that's it? Lock my camera with a cable? If I were you, I'd call to the mortgage lender in Webster Springs - and hear about someone has handed it over If it pops up, I'll call to Joy and hear if she knows anything Well ... Fine enough, please. Do you see what I'm doing? I've got some air and has fallen down a bit. I came to mind, that I had also recorded sound last night. So I have uploaded the file and shows what I found. I go straight to it. This starts at 02:47 Here are the only sounds during the night The sound of someone beating against a tree. What I've heard before, and then: Sounds a lot closer. Now even closer. Just getting taller. And right here, - - I think they cut the strap on the camera and took it. That's what it sounds like to me. The first thing sounds like something - - chopping in the tree, and then they grab the camera. And just a few seconds later ... ... the sounds are more distant. They must have knocked lightly against the tree - - they couldn't have moved say far away, so fast. I hear no footsteps at all. Only the sounds. Those are the only unusual ones sounds during the night. But if they think they have won, then they are wrong. And if the sheriff doesn't want to help, I'm just helping myself. Because I keep free. I drive back to Sutton and buys the same hunting camera as before. And this time I mount it high up in a tree, - - so it can take pictures all night of a full loser - - trying in vain to reach it. It is approx. 13:30, and I went to Sutton again this morning. Got exactly the same camera as before. This time I picked up the ladder from the garage - - and I mounted the camera about 6 feet up in that tree. Same tree as before. It should be safe up there overnight. It's all set up. It takes probably pictures of me now too. Hey, it's a test! Ready to take full pictures tossing at all times of the day. Cross your fingers, I want pictures tonight - - that allows me to put an end to everything. I'm also doing an audio recording again. So... Wish me luck. I'm happy to say that the camera managed it without being stolen. Here's the memory card, which I have just taken. So let's see if there's bite. The card fits into this adapter - - and then into the USB port. Let's see what we have. 27 photos during the night. These are maybe pictures of me, who sets up the camera and takes it down. Let's see. Yes, here is the first thing. When I put the camera on the tree yesterday. After, I had just turned it on. Next. The camera takes images in a series of three. One second in a row. There's the last one. They can all be me, which sets up the camera. There I remove the ladder. Yes here... ... 13:15 yesterday. When I filmed the update for everyone. More from the update. It was three and there I go. What the hell is that, 03:11 and 14 seconds? Probably just a mistake - - in the camera infrared, but it almost looks like someone is standing. 03:11:15, just a second later ... It looks like a shadow, but ... It was enough to activate camera motion detector. It took a series of three pictures. This is less than a second later and it's almost out of sight. 03:11:14, 15 .... ... and 15. 03:13, I don't even know what it is. It's the skull from the forest. There is the "B" cut in above. 3:13. It is not possible, the last series is at 3:11 p.m. Then 2 minutes later, there are cats skull. Oh God. 3:13. And there I am minutes ago. Where I pick up the camera. That's the last thing. Ok, I've been thinking about it. There are three possible explanations on the pictures we just saw. Number one: That of the camera timecode is defective. Which would explain, why the sequences - - appeared as if they had been taken every few minutes, - - since that would not be possible. The only thing is that the time code, when I set up the camera and took it down, - like when I made updates were all accurate. It makes no sense. Number two: That the person in charge, has its own memory card. Someone stole my former camera, so they have a memory card. They could have posted the altered images on the memory card and replaced it. But then they should use a computer for it ... Who would create all the problems just to annoy me? Wander out into the woods and take pictures of that skull? The third explanation is ... That there is something supernatural, but I refuse to believe that. None of the explanations makes any sense. How did they reach it? It sat 6 feet up I just thought of something. I came to mind, that I set the recorder to last night. I just uploaded the file computer and have looked it through. But it really doesn't things easier to understand. Now you see. Here's pretty much the same time of night, 3:11. As you might expect - - same sound as before. Then there is nothing else. Until - 4.30. This sounds awkward, but I remember when I heard - - what I thought was expensive and heard them on the internet. I think this is just a fox. It sounds awful, but this is the sound a fox makes. And then nothing ... ... before the birds start. And at the same time, such as the camera's time code. Here's the sound of me. That brings the ladder up to the tree And set it up against the tree and takes the camera down. But the thing is that in the rest of the recording, there is no similar sound - - by someone, setting a ladder against the tree. Which obviously doesn't make sense. I have no idea what to do. I'm not calling the sheriff again. What should I tell him? At my new camera takes creepy pictures. I want to blame mine increased dose of Venlafaxine. You saw what was going on the camera, it's not just me. I have to think. Everyone should know, that I don't just lie down - - and let these things happen to me. I've decided to approach it in two ways. Number one: Assuming that all the problems I've had - - is physical and tangible character that I think they are. I ordered a complete one security system for the house. And the technician is coming all the way from Morgantown tomorrow - - to install it. Then it's done. Number two: With the small chance that what I have to do with is not physically tangible - - I've spent a couple of hours on something, I never thought I would do. To search around on different Internet forums about the paranormal. But I ended up setting up an account on one of them - - and I wrote a description of that which has happened. I uploaded some of the pictures and some of the sound recordings. I logged into the account just before this update - - and I've already had four answers. Everyone calls me a liar. It doesn't help me. But at this time tomorrow - - I have a home security system. And I don't the hunting camera up tonight - - I don't want to make audio recordings. I just want to relax and get some wine, I know you shouldn't drink - - when you take Venlafaxine, but I drink some wine - - to help me relax off and make sure I can sleep. So good night. It's almost 8am, Saturday morning. It took a bit of an edge last night, for me ended up drinking the whole bottle of wine. But... It helped me sleep whole at night, so that's fine with me. A few minutes ago I logged into that forum - - to see what answers I got had gotten during the night. I now have a total of 45 responses. And I've listed them all for you. Of these 45 - - 37 of them call me a liar. They say that all my photos and audio recordings were fake. Two people said, that they hurt me - - but unfortunately they couldn't help. Five people said they had - - special objects, that would remove the evil spirit. And offered to sell them to me, A Minnesota woman said, that she needed more information - - and would have, that I should email her. She will probably try that sell me something if I do. But the important thing is, that my new home security system - - gets installed today. The technician should be here between 6 p.m. 8am and noon. I'll keep this update short. I send everyone - - a new update, when the security system is in place. Half an hour ago went I enter my bedroom - - and then my hunting camera stood on top of the dresser. My first thought was why is that promote? I always put it away. Then I noticed, that this strap was cut. I realized this is the original camera, what had been stolen. I went down into the basement and found it new camera where I knew it was. And it gets worse yet. As you will see in the pictures, I found on the camera's memory card. Here is the first picture. According to the time code, 03:08:10 at night. It's taken down the hall, - - towards the two bedrooms in between plan. The time code makes no sense, as you will see. Here is the second picture, also at 3:08:10. It is at the opposite end of the hallway. And here is the 3rd picture. So according to the time code, someone took the first picture, - ended up on the other end at a time and back again. All in one and a half seconds. And it gets even more weird. The next picture is on bottom of stairs, 3:08:22. The next... I think, that it is midway on the stairs. The third is just without for my bedroom. And again... All that should have happened in 1.5 seconds. This next picture ... ... I don't know what to interpret. This cat is obviously dead. There are flies on it. The picture was taken during the day - - and the note says, "Bunny from Vandal. The most beautiful. Killed her. " There may have been text on the back, - - but I can't tell. The temperature and time code are empty. The next picture - - is out in the woods, where I saw the cat skull. Now it's back to 3:09:15. The next picture, 3:09:16, is a blurry movement. And finally... ... it's back in the woods. None of that makes any sense. Hey. I just wanted to tell everyone, that I'm fine, - - and that I eventually wrote to the woman from the forum. Her from Minnesota, who had requested more information. Interestingly, she had asked, if I could give her more information - - about the former owners of this house. And I realized, that in my original post, - - even if I had included one lots of pictures and footage, - - I never got into it old man who hung himself. Or that his schizophrenic daughter was missing, or some of it. So I told her about it, and me also sent her the last pictures - - from the hunting camera, that I just shared with all of you. Who knows, if I hear anything from her, - or whatever she wants to try to sell me. The good news is, that this house is much safer now. A day late, but the security system is in place, now you must see. You get a quick tour. As you can see, - - every door and window on this plan now has this input sensor. And every time I open the front door - - I get one ... ... nice sound. And that's with the alarm off. If I had actually set the alarm - - it would beep loud for 30 seconds, and then a 120dB siren, - - which I think would be enough to scare anyone away. I had the opportunity to unplug it up to the police, but I reckon - - that would take them so long to answer ... What a difference it would make. So right now it's just the siren. But... It's going better. I'm probably on to get a little crazy out here. I probably enjoy that visit you in D.C. again And attend a meeting. I feel good - - and I'll keep everyone updated about what's happening. Good night. The time is around 03:20. And something awoke me, I do not know what. It could have been thunder. It rains, and it's really cold outside. But I opened the window and immediately - I could hear the whistle get up from the ground. I can't hear it now. Wait, there it is. Wait, wait, wait, listen. Do you hear that? It comes from... It comes from the hill up right. I have my gun. But I'm not going out there. In no way. I don't know who would be out there in this weather. Leave me alone! I think it stopped, I no longer hear it I don't hear it anymore. There it is. Do you hear that? Now it comes ... ... up there. It is far from, where I heard it before. I do not know what to do. I do not know what to do. It is 10:00 am, Sunday. After the update yesterday, I looked a few times - - after a message from my one contact on the paranormal forum. The woman from Minnesota. But there was nothing, so ... I ended up drinking a bit vodka, to try to relax But it did not help. I suppose I fell asleep - - around the time, where I saw the sun rise. I woke up a few minutes ago. But I just checked my email, and I got a message from her. And it's pretty far out. I read it to you. Her login name is "AstralMom1957", - Which must mean, that she was born in 1957 - - or there is 1956 other AstralMoms out there. I read it. Excuse me. Okay. “Hi, from the cold north. It's a beautiful morning, - the origin of the symphony begins at first light and followed - - of a soft sound of sunrise. " "Thank you for your long and detailed message. " "I've heard your part of West Virginia is beautiful, - since I have a dear friend, who camp at Seneca Rocks every year. " "But let's come to your problems. " "Even if you don't want to believe it, is there a being from the other side, - - who is responsible for them events you have described. " "However, I do not agree, that the former owner of the house - - who should have committed suicide, maybe the one responsible. " "Instead, I think the man's daughter, - who suffered from a mental disease, is responsible. " "I don't think she's alive." "But the medallion was left to you, the flute is played for you - - and female spirits are more likely to stay close to home. " "The important thing to remember is that you probably not in physical danger. " “As a new man in the house you are probably just in focus - - of pure curiosity or even worship - - especially if the woman was lonely and unsure of her appearance. " "Most spirits are gentle and carry on them the same insecurities they had in life. " "She might only be waiting for your acceptance." "Place in the forest that appeared on yours camera, may be the place where she died - - even if you said, it was far away." “It obviously had one some importance to her. " "Maybe her pet is buried there." “I don’t understand the banknote next to the cat, - - however, "Bunny from Vandal" may mean, that the cat's name was Bunny - - and one of its parents was Vandal. " “I would recommend not putting more cameras up or disturb her. " She doesn't want me to bother her. "If you accept her attention, as well as her presence, - the events are likely disappear on their own. " "I hope this message gives you hope and peace of mind - - and the light finds you and holds you safe wherever you live. " “I will meditate for your safety and well-being. AstralMom1957. " Isn't that nice? Let's believe in the incredible and assume, that she is right about any of this. She doesn't want me to interfere the poor, abandoned spirit - - which has made my life one hell ever since I moved in. Hi Claire. Do not worry, this message is for you only. You probably expected to hear from me after Marcy shared - - the pictures from the group hike to Great Falls yesterday. God forbid that the group should plan a trip and come and visit me. If you want to hike, I have endless forests in every direction. It's not because, that you would not have a place to sleep. Plus, I have to look at, not just one, but two pictures - - of you and David holding hands? After all you said to me? "He's just a friend, I don't care about him. " And I was stupid enough to believe it. Not surprisingly, you wanted to go away, as soon as the sun rose that day, You probably had a bad conscience. Who knows, what you were driving at the time. But.. Good for you, and I hope, that you are happy together. I wouldn't care - - if you weren't come and guide me ... That there was a chance, that something could happen between us. You know what I'm going through, and then you two discover - - through Marcy's group photos? But do you know what? I keep posting updates to the group like nothing had happened. I promise you never, ever get a private message from me again. Well done, Claire. Well done. You wanted to get rid of me? You have. It's almost 2:30 - - and to my surprise, does anyone play a flute - - right outside my window. But it's her laughing matter. Because I haven't slept yet, so she doesn't wake me or anything. So keep playing, ugly. Be quiet! Now that's enough! Now that's enough! Now that's enough! Now that's enough! Hi, from the cold north. Dusty.
