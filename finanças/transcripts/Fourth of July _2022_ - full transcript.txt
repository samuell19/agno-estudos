Here we go, boys! Let's go! Come on! Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. I know, Mom. I'm sorry. No, you're right. You're right. It's very frustrating. No, she shouldn't talk to you like that. Okay. No, I know, I know. I know how he is. Okay. Me? Yeah, I'm good. Well, the other night, I... Okay. No, yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Bye. I'll see you soon. Fuck! Fuck. Hello? I had the thing again where I thought I ran over a guy. Did you run over a guy? No. I mean, I don't know. I felt like it. And I saw it. You saw it? No. I heard a noise and it felt like something. I saw it in my mind, like, as clear as day. Okay, you've had this same intrusive thought four times since we started meeting. - Mm-hmm. Now, what do you think the odds are that you've actually run over four people with your car who then ran and hid from you? What are the... What are the real-world odds that this has happened to you four times? No, I know, but maybe this time. I mean... It could happen, and people do run people over with their cars. And I was on the phone, which I know is bad. I shouldn't have done that. - Who were you on the phone with? - My mother. What did your mom say? - I don't want to talk about it. - Then maybe we better. But what about this? What if we just solved all the other problems and worked on those problems and then just ignore my mother? Sure. Or we could talk about your mother. And then all those other things might take care of themselves. Fuck. You suck. - Mm-hmm. You're, like, the worst therapist. Most likely, yeah. I'm suffering. Maybe you're not suffering enough. Why would you say that? What does that mean? Well, if you were in more pain, and enough pain, you might seek a real solution. That's how some people might view it. - But I'm here. - Yes, you are. I'm seeking a solution. I come here and I talk to you. - We're out of time. - Good. Come on. I'm sorry to say this, but I'm not finding anything here. Shit. Are you sure? Yes. Look. Is the left side of your face... That's where you were having the issue? Yeah, it's all along here. - Yeah, well, that's here. - Right. And it looks great. I've examined you. - Okay, but what's this? What's this right here? See that? - That? - Mm-hmm. - That's your jaw. - Okay. And it looks great. It looks fantastic. Okay, but maybe we should take an X-ray from a different angle, because I think... Jeff, you've had two X-rays in almost three weeks. That's almost malpractice. Okay, what about an MRI? - MRI? Yeah, it's just a really weird feeling all along here, and... Is it painful? No, it's not painful. It's just... It's, like, terrifying. And I just know there's something wrong here. Do you want something to be wrong? - Hey, Bill. - Invisible Man. ...I know, I know. I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay. Look, I don't have much time. Oh, shit. I'm so sorry. I'm just... I'm never late, all right? - Look, you're here now. - Okay. Um, are you eating? - No, just coffee. - Okay. Do you mind if I eat? 'Cause I'm starving. - No. It's fine. Okay. Sorry. I'm gonna have, uh, eggs... Like, scrambled... Lots of scrambled eggs. Like four, cheddar cheese, and white toast. - Got it. - Lots of eggs. - Got it. - Okay. Thank you. Ugh, I'm really sorry. It's not... I'm gonna... - Go ahead and eat. - Okay. But you're not eating, is the thing. How you doing? I haven't heard from you. Um, I'm okay. How are you doing? Wife. Teenage kid. Yankees. You get to a meeting today? Yeah, I went to the one on third. Oh, well, good meeting. Yeah. They're a good group. There's just that one guy that drives me nuts. He always says, um, "I'm definitely an alcoholic," as though we're not alcoholics. It really just makes me a little nuts. We used to have a guy in my home group, used to say, "I'm Martin, the alcoholic." - Right. He's like a superhero. - Yeah. But that's... that's what they got to do to tell themselves. They're just saying it so they can hear it. - Right. That makes sense. - Okay. So, good? - In that respect. Yeah. - Yeah. You coming up on what, two and a half years? Yeah. Three... Three in November. - Fucking A. - Yeah. - Son of a bitch. - Yeah. Well done. - Feels good. Yeah. - I'm proud of you. - Oh, thank you, Bill. Thank you. Well, I wouldn't have done it without you, so... Yeah, well, maybe. Look, I found you a sponsee. Oh, um... See, right now, I think that might be a lot. - You're ready. - No, it's not about being ready. It's just today I had, like, a lot. - He's a drummer. - Oh, he's a drummer. That's fun. He's a drummer, you're a drummer. You're my drummer. You're a drunk, he's a drunk. We're gonna meet him after the gig tonight. That just feels like a lot right now. Look. Are we doing this, or are we doing this? No, we're doing it. We're doing it. I just think I'm a little scrambled right now. I'm busy, I guess, is what I'm saying. And taking on a sponsee might be a little bit... Okay. I have a wife younger than me. I got a teenage kid. I got two grown kids, three cats, and six sponsees. And right now, I'm not counting you. You understand? - Yeah. Listen, you show up late. I haven't heard from you. You're teetering. Look at me. Either lean forward, take the next step, or lean back, fall down a flight of stairs. No, that makes sense. Um... Look, I know it's a lot. Sponsoring another guy. Not easy. In fact, it's a giant pain in the ass. - I know. - Like this. And I'm sorry I was late. - Don't worry about it. That's not eggs. We got to fix that. No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. It's fine. - You sure? This actually looks really good. Yeah, this is better. Okay, look, I got to split, kid. And I'll see you tonight. Okay. Thanks, Bill. Just take the next right action. Okay. Perfect. And call me more than never. Okay. Will do. Thank you. Um... Hey. Maybe I'll get this to go. Is that okay? - Yeah. - Yeah, it looks good. I just... Something came up. Thank you. I know what I want. Can I have four scrambled eggs? Like, soft scrambled, cheddar cheese, and white toast, please. Thank you. Hey. When are we going to Maine? Oh-ah! Oh. Are we saying the full two weeks? 'Cause, like... I mean, that's such a long time. I know, I know. I know. I'm sorry. They're brutal. I know. Well, like, I don't know how they feel about me. And then your mom never lets me help in the kitchen. And then your aunts feel like I don't ever want to help. And then there's the Kevin factor. I know. That all checks out. Kevin sucks. He's like... He's a tyrant. I'm sorry, but I don't know. Maybe we should just not go. Fuck it. Let's just not go this year. We'll skip one year. I'm... I'm just saying for one week. Well, I'm saying let's just not go it all. Full skip. Fuck it. Jeff, we have to go. It's your family. It's every 4th of July. I know, I know. We're gonna go. We'll go. We'll go for one week. We'll go for one week. We'll sleep in the tiny room. We'll have sex in the tiny bed. We'll deal with Kevin when we get there. Whatever. It'll be fine. I hate myself. My father hates me. My mother hates you. It's gonna be great. Your mom hates me? ♪ I said Louie, Louie ♪ ♪ Whoa, no, I said we got to go ♪ ♪ I said Louie, Louis ♪ ♪ Whoa, baby, I said we got to go ♪ ♪ A fine little girl who waits for me ♪ ♪ Sail on a ship across the sea ♪ ♪ Sail that ship about all alone ♪ - Hey. - Hey. What's going on? - It was a good one, right? - Yeah. It's good to hear them talk about this stuff, you know? Absolutely. It's crucial. How you feeling? - This second, I feel good. - Okay, great. I'm worried about tomorrow when you leave. - Right. - Hey, I'll see you. How am I supposed to keep this shit up forever? Well, you don't have to keep it up forever. Just get to tomorrow. You can't get 10 years in one day. My friend got 10 years in one minute. He's still serving it up in Rikers. You see, that's a great reminder how bad it can get. It was a joke. I was just kidding. Well, I'm just saying, keep a little gratitude in your attitude. When do I get to that point? Well, I've been sober about three years. No, I'm talking the point where I'm speaking in bumper stickers. - You two play nice. - All right. Thanks, Bill. Look. I don't really know you. I mean, we just met tonight. Right? I mean, they sound silly. It's very bumper stickery, I admit, but there's actually a lot of wisdom in those things. So until we have more of a rapport, I might just say this silly stuff, but there is a lot of wisdom in it. I just want to help you. It helps me to help you. Does that make sense? - Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. - No, no, no, no. - I get it. I get it. - It's all right. I get it. Thanks. Thanks. - Yeah, you're welcome. Thank you. So, how do we do this? What do we do? How's this... Oh, right. Okay, so we're gonna exchange contact info. I'll give you my number, all that shit. And you call me if you feel like drinking. What, we're gonna go drink together? You serious? No. I'm your sponsor, so if you feel like having a drink, you call me, I help. Okay. Right. Sorry. All right, yeah. I like you. You want a... You want a ride or...? - Yeah. You got wheels? - Yeah. I have a car. - I'll take a ride. - Let's go. Come on, buddy. - What about this stuff? This is... We're the last ones out. Take anything. There's... Fuck the banana. - Hey. - Hey. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Can't believe you live here. - I do. And you're getting in this bed with me right now. Yeah. And we're gonna make sweet love? - We are. - Whoa. And I'm gonna have one orgasm. - Yeah. - And you might also. - We'll see. - It's great. - It's pretty great. - Yeah. Hey, man. - Hey. Come on in. Okay. Got the game on? Yeah. Just watching the game. Um... Uh... My mom was overweight. - What's that? Hi. - We weren't doing anything. - Okay. - Beth, this is Bobby. - Oh, hi. We went to high school together. What? Uh, how was your run? - It was good. - Good. Okay, I'm gonna go. Oh. Um, all right, Bob. See ya. I'll talk to you... I'll call you. Sure thing. All right. Great. Is that one of your...? Yeah, he's... He's cuckoo. It's nice that you're helping him. Yeah, I don't know. Probably not, honestly, but I'm trying. Hey, do you know when we're going to Maine? 'Cause there's some stuff I need to figure out. Um... I'm saying let's not go. I'm saying, like, let's not go to Maine at all. I mean, I'm not saying let's not go. I'm saying I'm excited. Unless you don't want to go. I don't know. I'm gonna take a shower. Oh. Okay. That's good. What? I saw you texting with Leah. - You read my texts? - No. No, I didn't read them. I just... I saw that you were texting and I closed it before I read anything. You what? Um... You remember, um... You remember Diana? Princess Diana? No. My girlfriend, Diana from Denver. Oh, the one with the tits and the mouth. Right, right. Yeah. All right, well, one time... I never told you this, but one time, she left her phone unlocked. And so I looked at her texts, and I shouldn't have, but she was describing me to her best friend, and she wrote, "Jeff, he's, like, amazing, and he's adorable, and he's really funny. I just find him really unattractive." That's terrible. What a cunt. Thank you. But... I guess... when I saw you texting, I-I thought of that, and it made me realize, like, there must be things you text to your friends about me that, I don't know, you would never say to me. And I guess I don't want to make you say anything you don't want to say, but I guess I'm wondering, like, is... I'm not happy 'cause we never had a baby. What? I mean, we're fine, and I'm attracted to you and you're great. But I think deep down, or not even deep down, I'm just unfulfilled. I-I wanted to be a mom. Beth... But... You never even, like, talk about that anymore. I thought you just, like, stopped caring about that. No, I-I didn't. Why did you stop bringing it up? I mean, you're great and you're greatest, and you're more than I ever need, but... And you're the best husband ever. It's just... Wait, you didn't give up on being a mom. You gave up on me being a dad. You shouldn't people's texts. You should ask them things. So, what did you say when Beth said this to you? I said nothing. Well, do you think she's right? Do you think that you can't be a father? I don't know. Well, can you picture it? A kid? I mean, you with a kid? Yeah. I mean, there's the idea of having a kid... A guy or my little buddy, and it's our guy, and... And it's our family. How's that feel? It feels good. And I want that. I want her to be happy. I don't know what to do. It's not a surprise that you're struggling with this. I mean, you're contemplating having a child and you're somebody's child. And my mom. Right? My mom and my dad and the problems with my parents. And if I don't confront them, I'll never be happy. You don't have to do anything you don't... That you can't do, Jeff. I mean, you and Beth are doing fine. Within your limits, you could just... But I don't want to do that. I need to... I have to do it... I have to go and confront my parents and get this shit off my chest. I can't live like this. What? You don't think I'll do it? You said I wasn't suffering enough, right? Okay, well, now I'm suffering enough. I want to do something, so help me. Let's... Let's do something about it. Jeff, we... we talked about confronting your parents three years ago, right? Now, every time you go to Maine, you say you're gonna do it. And when you come back, you always tell me that you were... you were having too good a time and you didn't want to... You didn't want to ruin it. No, I know. That's what happened. That's what has happened in the past. Right. So maybe it's better that... that... To just accept that that's how you cope. That's how you cope. Maybe a step forward would be to own it and not to expect that you're gonna do it in the first place. Don't say you're gonna do it and then set yourself up to fail. Just... You gave up on me, too. Everybody in my fucking life has given up on me. What would AA say about that? Oh, fuck you. I'm sitting here. I'm trying to help. I'm trying to do something. I'm ready to confront my parents. I want to do it. And now you're not even helping me. You're out of time. I have another patient. I'm going to Maine on Tuesday. - You're going? - Yeah, I'm going alone. - You're mad at me? - No, I'm not mad at you. I love you. That's why I have to go do this. I have to go and confront my parents and say all this shit that I've been holding inside, all this shit that's been destroying me. I have to go say it. It's time. - Don't you want my support? - No. I mean, I-I do. I love you, but I've got to go alone, because if you come, it's gonna be the same. I'll puss out. I know I will. And I have to get out of this cycle. So I'm just gonna go there. I'm gonna confront my parents. I'm gonna kill my parents. I'm gonna come back. We're gonna make sweet love. You're gonna get pregnant, have a baby. You'll be the happiest woman on Earth. And eventually I'll die. And then you'll die. And then all our little dumb kids will die. - Sounds good. - Okay, great. Are you gonna fuck my friends while I'm gone? I mean, I would if you went or not. Great. Not really, right? There are many ways in which we use the term "self," and not all of these terms are illusory. I can think of myself as a writer or a father or a customer in a store. No one is simply a human being. You're a lover, a window washer, massage therapist. An elderly woman. A dead woman. A ghost. Hey, Dad. Your mom's inside. Okay. Thanks. Um... - How was the ride? - Um... Good, good. I took 91 part of the way. To Merritt. Thank you. - Thank you. - All right. - I got to pee, man. Will you get the bags out of the back, please? I'll just go around. - Hey, Tom. - Hey, Needle Dick! Hi, Jeffy. He took 91 the whole way. - Jeffy! - Hey. - Oh! New York! - Hey. No, Kev. I gotta... - What's up? - Hey. How's Faggot Town, faggot? - Faggot Town is fine, thanks. - Yeah? How do you like the Yankees this year? - I hate the Yankees. - They fucking suck! Well, they're in for... Never mind that. Take a look at this, huh? 25 years old. 25 fucking years old. I stole it from her uncle Her grandfather brought it over on the boat. It's some family treasure or some shit. You and I are killing this bottle tonight, kid. - I don't drink, Kevin. - Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na. Smell that. - I smell it. I can smell it. - It's 25 years old! - I know. Hey. Hey. How come Michael Jackson likes 25-year-olds? I don't know. Why? 'Cause there's 20 of them. - 5 year olds. - Oh! Fuckin' kid-fucker! Hey, those kids knew what they were getting into. May he suffer in Hell. All right! All right! All right, all right! Everybody outside! I'm cooking in here. We're glad to have you, but get the hell out. It's a beautiful day. Go, go. Hi, hon. Hey, Mom... and Dad. Um, I need to talk to you guys at some point this week. - What? What's up? - No, not now. Just at some point during the week. - Not now. What? - No, no, it's nothing. Just... I just, at some point later in the week, I thought... I wanted to just talk about some stuff. Oh, okay. What's up? Oh, okay. Well, all right. I guess I've been grappling. With some issues. Where's Beth? Beth's not coming this year. - Ohhh! - But that's not... - No, no. - Okay. Yeah. Loud and clear. I'm sorry, honey. We saw this coming. Tricia! - Yeah, Shirles? - Jeff and Beth! - Aw! Yeah! You make sure that cunt doesn't get a nickel, Jeffrey! No, that... First of... That's really hurtful, but it's not... Everything's fine with Beth. Well, what's up, then? You got a bug in your bonnet? Yeah. I mean, I guess I just want to talk about some stuff, you know? - So talk. Here we are. - Okay. Well, in my life... - Darlene! That's for later. But I thought you wanted it put out. No. Did I say that? Back. Sorry, honey. What? I just. I wanted to talk about how we never share any, like, feelings in the family, and I feel like you never show me, like, love. - What? - No, no, it's fine. It's just, like, I don't know the last time we said "I love you." And I actually don't think we've ever said "I love you." And like, I can't remember the last time we hugged. I feel like we've never really even hugged. And at this point in my life, I just feel like... You need a hug? Here, come here, come here. Well, it's not that I need a hug, I just... - Yeah. Come here. - Oh. Okay. There you go. Okay? You okay now? Yeah. That's go... I feel good. Thank you. Sorry. Yeah, baby. Oh, yeah! What? The char is killing me. Ah, you're at the wrong end of it. What is that, rubber? Sounds like a... Smells like a tire fire. They get bigger as they get older, you know. They do? - They just get longer. - They do get... They get long. I love when you're bad. - Oh! - Yeah. Beautiful. Here you go. What the fuck are these? Thought that's what you wanted. No, I wanted the... The long ones with the... With the... with the bumps in 'em... the crunchy ones. These are... These are... Where'd you get these, at BJ's? Here, here! Scratch tickets, scratch tickets. Grab a scratch ticket. Here you go. There you go, buddy. This one's for you. No, sir. More for me. How's New York? New York's okay. How is, uh... What is it, the plumbing store? No. That was three jobs ago, kid. Oh, right. A guy caught me stealing copper, selling it to another store. - Jesus. - Rules are meant to be broken. Yeah. Well, actually, I think it might be the opposite, but... - I keep getting that wrong. - It's all right. How much money you make stealing copper from one store and selling it to another? Oh. More than you'd think. Copper's a commodity. Changes price every day. So I'd steal low, sell high. - That's good. Smart. - Yeah. Well, if you're gonna suck a cock, make it a big one. If you don't need to come, you can't have the cake. Takes two dicks to make a cunt fat. - You got a pair of tits... - Takes, uh... Shit. - Oh. - You got it. - No, mine's nothing. - Here comes your cousin Brenda. - Hey, everybody. - Bren-Bren. - Hi. This is Naomi, my friend from work. She's staying with us this week. Naomi, that's my Aunt Tricia. There's Aunt Darlene. That's Uncle Chris. Shirley, his wife. It's their party. That's Tony. He's Italian. Don't know Marion's boyfriend. Uh, that's Gramps. It's his place. And the uncles... Kevin, Mark. - Hey. What's up, guy? Sitting with him's Jeff, my cousin. And, uh, there's kids running around. So... My... My dad died and my mom don't come around no more. So... Everybody! I brought Naomi here to get some nice, fresh air. She, uh... Might as well get this out in the open. Her husband just died recently. - Aw! Thought you were gonna say she was black. Oh, shut the fuck up, stupid. That's obvious. - Fuck you. Well, if it helps, I'm half black. It's okay. Kevin's half retarded. - Which half is black? - My father. Ah, you know what that means. She got a big cock. - Welcome to the family, hon. - Oh. Yeah. To each his own, I always say. Grab a plate. Come on, everybody, eat. - Let's go get some food. - Come on. Eat. Time to eat. Come on. Darlene, where are the knives and forks? You didn't tell me to get the knives and forks. Grab me a burger. Make sure you don't take all the butter. - Thank you. - I grilled some hot dogs, too. I just need one dog. Look, I, uh... Can I get a plate over here? Jeff, over here. Right next to Naomi. Naomi, Jeff's married but not for long. You got to get back in there, Jeff. Her husband's dead. I'm happily married, by the way. Yeah, I just lost my husband like six months ago, So I'm not, you know. All right. I'm sorry. Sorry about them, too. Could you pass me those? - Oh, yeah, totally. Yeah. - Thanks very much. Appreciate it. - Pass the ketchup. - Do you need more chips? Can we get more chips, please? Yeah, you want more chips? All right, darling. Why are... Why are we out of buns? Thanks. - Hey, Grandpa. - Hmm? I kind of got to piss. Go off the side. Water's right there. It's all right, I'll just wait. Lucky bastard. Thanks. How'd you do? Two sunburns. No fish. Yeah? Almost dinner? Almost. I love that story. Tell it again. Yeah, and the mother dropped it. It broke like a... Oh, come on! Yeah, when Mark worked down at the quarries, there was those two black guys. And... Pardon me, Naomi. And Mark and them got caught swimming during work in their underwears. Fags. No, no. No, but one of them was, though. Mark, didn't you say you felt kind of weird in your underwears 'cause one of the black guys was gay or something? Sorry, Naomi. It's really okay that the guys were black. See? I told you she was cool. Hey, Naomi, want to hear a joke? - No, not really. - No, no, it's a really good joke. Hey, Tony, you got one of these for me? Oh, yeah, I brought you one, kid. Thought you said you were sober. Sober? Smoking cigars? You're gonna be doing shots in a few minutes. How about this? How about this? Jeff comes in today, says to Dad and me, "Hey, Ma, can we talk? I don't feel like you love me. I got issues. We never share our feelings enough. You don't love me." That's that New York. That's that... That's that fucking New York in him. "You never hug me," he goes. I'm like, "I'm your mother. I don't love you?" I did your laundry 18 years. - That's right. - Did your dishes. - That's right. Cleaned your skid-marked underwears. He used to piss his pants. And I don't love him? - Shame on you. That's how it is with them now. No fucking... No appreciation, no fucking tradition. Getting sober, getting fucking gay. Getting sober. A man drinks with his family, with his friends. Makes love to a woman. Woman has his child. She loves that child. The child loves the mother back. Not no fucking more of the fucking therapy. Nothing decent no more. Fucking New York. That's correct. Question isn't whether your mother loves you, Jeffrey. You can't even scientifically ask that question. Question is... do you honor your mother? Do you honor your father? Grace of God. My son knows I love him. Just like I know my dad loves me. I said the whole thing, basically. I mean, right when I got here. But it was just... - Was it unsatisfying? - Very. They didn't really listen. They just waved it off like I said we didn't have enough butter, then they ended the conversation. I don't know what to do. Listen, Jeff, I'm at home right now. - Oh, okay. Oh. - Yeah. - Sorry. - It's okay. Look, we'll talk about this when you get back. Yeah. All right. Sorry. Thank you. Hey, kid. How's Maine? You get a lobster? Hey, Bill. No, it sucks. I don't want to be here. It's the same shit. Nothing changes. They're drunks, they're assholes. And honestly, I can't even believe I'm in this family, except for Mark. - Yeah, yeah. Do... Do you feel like you're gonna drink? No, not at all. Okay, then, you know, do your best. Do the stuff we talked about. Call me if you're in trouble, you know? All right. Yeah. Thanks. And when you feel like picking up a drink, pick up the phone, right now, and call a newcomer. Call your sponsee. Stay with it. - Yeah, you bet. Thanks, Bill. - That's nice. - Thank you. It is nice. Do you always play in the morning? I do here. They're all sleeping. Drunks. You don't want them to hear you play? They don't want to hear me play. I'm sure they'd love to hear you play. Uh... I don't think so. They're not, uh, piano people. - Mm. Knock that shit off. Fucking jazz. Yuck. Jazz... more like jizz. Coffee. Fucking coffee. Naomi? - No. No, thanks. There you go. The reviews are in. Wow. You really want to play, huh? I do. It's what I do. - There you go, buddy. - Hey. Thank you, Uncle Mark. No problem. How are you his uncle? Is it just, like, a nickname? You guys look the same age. No, I'm his uncle for real. - He's a mistake. - Oh. See, that's my father. His grandfather. And your mother? That's her right there. Yeah. She's dead, though. Very dead. She's, like, a skull now. Maybe some dust. Worms. - That's your mother? - I didn't know her. She died when I was three. Jezebel! Jeff's dad there, Chris... That's my older brother. Older by a lot. He raised me, really, alongside this bird turd. We were drinking buddies since we were 10 and 12. But he's a quitter. - Yeah. - No, sir. He's triple-A or whatever. He's better off. Let me tell you, if this cock-sucker was still drinking, he'd be dead. - Really? - Probably. This kid was way out of order. Fuckin' psycho when he drank. He'd put away a quarter rum, case of beer. This one time, we were in Harvard Square... - Oh! - ...harassing these fat chicks. Jeff sees a "Boston Globe" truck... You know, one of the big, boxy ones. He jumps on the back like a garbage man, screaming and yelling. - What were you screaming? - Like, "Extra, extra. Read all about it." But he's got the story wrong. That's not right. The fat girls were chasing us 'cause I stole one of their book bags. Why did you steal their book bags? You want to hear the story or not? They were fat Harvard girls. We were harassing them. They were like, "You dumb fucking drunks. You're so fucking stupid." And Jeff was like, "Fuck you. I go to Harvard, too. Look at all my books in my book bag." And Jeff took off and started running. They came after us. They were fast for a bunch of fat chicks. They were fast. Fast and fat. They ran like Babe Ruth. Jeff jumps on the "Globe" truck. "Extra, extra. Read all about it." "Four Fat Harvard Girls Lose Book Bag." The truck takes off into traffic. I'm runnin', trying to hop on like a hobo on a freight train. The fucking truck starts up the ramp onto St or row Drive. - I jumped off. - Did you get hurt? Oh, yeah. Very badly. He was in the hospital for a month. So, that's when you quit drinking? Mnh-mnh. That's when I started eating pills. Yeah. Remember the other time? When the cab driver gave us tickets to the Bruins game? - The ticket cab guy. - Yeah. We were on our way to the Faneuil Hall. Right? And the guy's just like, "I have two tickets"... And the fear in my life at every turn, Darlene. You're just fucking ungrateful, is all. You got no sense of grace, is all. You know what, Darlene? I'm sorry your husband died. And I'm sorry that my man is stronger and is still with me today. And I'm sorry that Jerome couldn't handle his liquor... - How dare you? - ...and that he succumbed. How dare you?! Perhaps if you'd been a better wife, huh? That's the only difference between me and you... Is Kevin comes from money and Jerome had to work for a living. What fucking money? Let the fuck go of me. You pissed it all away, and it's all our fault? I'm just trying to help you. - Don't talk to me, Darlene. I'm just trying to help you. You're not. You're a fucking meddler. - No, I'm not! - Yeah. You're a meddler. - I love you, though. - I don't want your fucking love. - Oh, come on. - God! Oh, honey, are you okay? All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right. It's 2021! I'll hit a woman. I'll hit a fucking woman. - Knock it off! Knock it off! - Don't think... Look, I'm not above slugging my sister-in-law, but her mother's a real pig. - Come on, guys. It's breakfast. - Oh, fine. You don't put the fucking post in that close, or the fucking net won't be high enough! It's got to be taut. It's got to be fucking taut, or it's gonna be too low. Yeah, but you make it taut on the other side, you fucking asshole. - Shut the fuck up. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. All right, all right. Listen, to stem the tide of further arguments, I'm gonna pick the teams, all right? So, Darlene, honey, you're with me. Uh, Naomi, you're with me. We need a guy. Tony, you're with us. We've got to split up Jeff and Mark, so Mark, you play with us. On Jeff's team, Kevin and the girls, right? Tricia. Brenda. All right, let's play nice, everyone. Hit it to Darlene. Hey, Kevin, shut the fuck up. Zero. When's the other team showing up? I got it. There it is. Oh! I bet you'd love it if I broke my ankle. Awww! Now you're in trouble. Come on, Tony. - Tony, hit the fucking ball. - There we go. All right. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! - Yeah! Yeah, baby. - Fucking asshole. I'm on your team. I know, but that was an important point. No, play. All right, all right. Play. I haven't missed the ball all day. Let's go. - Point. - Yes! - That's out! - We're back, baby! On the losers' team. Loser. Kick 'em all. Fucking idiot. Jesus, Kevin. That fucking hurts. - You're fucking kidding. Come on, Bren. Come on, Bren. Oh, shit. What the fuck? Dude! What the fuck are you doing? You're a fucking piece of shit. You fucking idiot. - What the fuck? Relax. - What are you doing? Yeah, a fucking sex crime is fucking fun, you fucking dick weed. - Have a fucking drink and get a sense of humor, fucking... - Shake it off, shake it off. - You're all right. No, no, I'm not all right. I'm not all right. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - He's a fucking asshole. Where are you going? I'm fucking done. I'm done. - It's the fucking rubber match. - What rubber? It's first game. It's just something you say. - You take it too far. - Oh, shut up. Who's asking you? - All right. - What do you mean, you quit? The teams are even now. We can keep playing. We just started. - I need a beer. - You can't let them... All right. Who wants to go one-on-one? Darlene, can you get me a beer? ...the alcohol content, but nobody can fucking hit a ball more than twice. It's called volley. You got to... Hey! Hey! Knock that shit off. Trying to talk over here. Jeff, at least play a song or something. Play a song. Enough with the fucking Liberace faggot shit. My God. - Yeah, Jeff, come on. Play something we all like. Let's have a sing-along. Oh, yeah! - "Piano Guy." - "Piano Guy"! Yeah! Start us off. The fuck's his problem? It's 'cause you hit him in the cock. Fuck you. Fuck you who? Fuck all of you. Fuck everybody in this room, including me. Fuck you that I can't... that... And fuck me that I can't even fucking... I hate it here. I fuck... Fuck this. Who the fuck shat in your soup? - Fuck you, Kevin. - Told you it was you. Fuck you, Tony. Fuck you and fuck you. And fuck you, Brenda. And fuck you, Dad. You watch your mouth, Jeffrey. Fuck you, Mom! Fuck you. You better pray forgiveness. You said fuck your mother. Shut up, Darlene. Shut up. I'm sorry, but just shut your stupid fucking mouth. I mean, what are you doing here? Where are your kids? Where are all your fucking kids? And where were you? What kind of people are you? What kind of people are we? I'm with you. I fucking hate myself, too. This is why I didn't have a kid. I don't want to fucking bring a kid into this and subject them to what I fucking went through. Maybe I'll have a kid, but I'm not gonna bring him up here. You're fucking drunks. - Oh, oh, okay. 'Cause you're fucking New York and you're... You're better than us now. Yes, I am better than you, which sucks. I'm fucking embarrassed by you, Kevin. And I wish I wasn't. You're my uncle. I need you to be better than me. And you're my father. And you're my mother. And what kind of mother are you? You're like a fucking spider that keeps everybody here all wrapped up coming to you, and you feed them fucking drinks, so they're all the worst version of themselves. So everyone's fucking miserable. They don't even realize it. They're too drunk to realize it. That's why I'm miserable. This is why I don't... I didn't bring Beth here. I don't want to subject Beth to this 'cause she deserves better, and you guys don't deserve Beth. I thought I came up here to ask you to love me the way a mother should. I think I came up here to say fuck you. I'm sorry. Hey. Call me right away. Thanks. Love you. Bye. Hey. - Hi. What's up? - Nothing. I-I did it. - What did you do? I told them. I told them everything. I-I went crazy. I kind of lost my mind. I said I'm miserable. I said, "I hate this." I said... I said "fuck you" to my mom. You said "fuck you" to your mom? Yes. It was pretty amazing. I wish you could have seen it. What did she say? Uh, I don't know. I don't know. What difference does it make? Who cares? Do you know what this means? I'm like a new man. I'm gonna come home, I'm gonna need to shave more. I might start hitting you. I'm the man now. I'm the man of the family... Of our family. Okay. Good. I love you. You fucking bet your sweet ass you do. I got to go. But I love you, and I will talk to you soon. Bill. Hey, pal. You okay? Yeah, actually, I'm pretty great. Look, going home sober... Always tough. The folks will push your buttons. Hell, they fucking installed them. Just remember, rule number one, "Say what you mean, but don't say it mean." Right. - Morning. - Hi. You doing okay? I'm good. I feel good. That was crazy yesterday. Which part? All the stuff you said. It was incredibly brave. - Oh. I've never seen anyone talk to their mother that way. Well, all that stuff's been building up and it needed saying. I'm sorry you had to... You're not scared? What do you mean? - I don't know. - They were pretty drunk. I don't... I doubt they even remember it. Ah, it was pretty dramatic. Good morning. Julie, hon. Come out to the patio. Go, go, go. So... You said some things last night. Now we have some things. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You said that word to me, your mother. And you accused me. I'm a spider, you said. So said the spider to the fly. Now you listen to me. You left this family to pursue your childish dreams in New York. You abandoned us. You left. And yet we welcome you with open arms, including that woman you bring here, who has never once confided in me or shown her true colors. And yet we bring you here with love. And we are patient because we know, like every chick, you will come home to roost. We know that when your foolish dreams leave you dry, it's your family you will need. And you have the audacity to say that we force you to be here, that I spin my web and I hold you a prisoner? Well, let me tell you something. By the grace of Heaven, you're in this family. And by my wrath, you'll be out. You blame your father for your problems. You say he didn't hug you, like you were a girl, and it's his fault now that you have to do everything in fours or whatever the doctor said. What doctor? - Let her speak! Let her speak! - Let her talk. Shame on you. You stick to your druthers, Jeffrey. You should be grateful to have this family. Some people don't have a family. You're sitting right next to someone whose husband died. How dare you? Shame on you, Jeffrey. Shame! Tricia, shut your goddamn mouth and get that child out of here. You know what you did last night? You broke your father's heart. And shame on you. Shame on you, dear God. - Mom, I... Don't you dare offer an apology now. It will not be accepted. You're on notice. Nobody needs you here, Jeffrey. It is you who needs us. May it always be. We keep the peace. It's 4th of July weekend. Celebrate our nation. But you get your ducks in a row. Ready for a drink yet? Holy shit. Oh, my God. I told you. I told you they didn't forget. Could've warned me. No, you made a good impression. Morning. They have the cameras come in, but it's worse 'cause they're handling scratch tickets and money and shit. It's wrapped up in cellophane. And then you're gonna buy a fucking tuna-fish sandwich from the guy? - Me? I fucking love it. Why wouldn't I? I guarantee you've eaten a booger in the last week. Okay, well, then I like boogers in my tuna. 'Cause if he's available, obviously I want him. He's a better player, but... Yes. Well, either... Either guy is fine. I mean, they're both great, but obviously he's better. So if he's available, I want him. I mean, we want to have that full sound. Well, then we'll play as a five-piece. That's fine, too. Shirley. Shirley. Shirley. I'm telling you right now... - Shirley! - What? - I'm going to bed. - Already? - Yeah. - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Okay. And you guys, put the dishes away after you dry them. I don't want to wake up tomorrow and see a sideboard full of dishes. Those girls can't finish a job. Hang up the pants. The sandwich for tomorrow got spoiled. Gonna have to go into town and get a pork or something. I... I think, uh... I... feel ashamed. Or something. - No, you don't. Go to bed. Yeah. I, uh... Yeah, I-I just, uh, feel bad. Well, he had no right to talk to me that way. No. No. Um, I, um... I think... I think I let him down. And, uh... It's worse than that, even, 'cause... To let someone down, you gotta... uh... in the first place. And I think I feel ashamed of myself. And I think... it's too late. For anything. It's too late. Where... What are you saying this for now? Where's this from now? Are you saying I did something? You coming down to breakfast? Ah, that fucking nitwit park ranger. Not the first time we've met that guy. A couple years ago. I'm deaf in my left ear. Thanks, Ton. Jesus. Excuse me. Can't even hear. It's ringing. Fuck's the matter with you? It's Ma. She's dying, I think. What do you mean, she's dying? What are you talking about? - She's dying. - She's not dying. She's okay. Go outside, all right? And have a good time. Okay? Come on, Darlene. What are we eating? What, am I supposed to eat my hand? Bro, you got to make this right. What? I mean, you had your fun, but that's your mom. Everything's all fucked up. Hey, hey, hey. Just go say you're sorry. - I'm not sorry, Mark. - Well, you got to be sorry. I mean, I get you working out your thing, but blah, blah, blah. This is family. You don't fuck around with that. I mean, you think I don't have things? You think I don't have shit I got to get off my chest? Things I need to say for me? But I don't bring that in here. That's not for them. That's my own shit. I'll take it to my grave, most likely. You need to say you're sorry, kid. I mean, I know you know it. Just... Just do it. Mark, I needed to say what I said. All right, maybe I could have said it better, but... I want an apology from her. An apology from her? Yeah. What are you, Hitler? Dude. You know what she's like. You were there. I mean, you fucking... You saw it. Yeah. Yeah, so what? That's life, bro. You don't fix that. You don't make your mother say she's sorry. Bro, what the fuck? You didn't have it that bad. My mother died, bro. Yeah, I know the fucking family history, Mark. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Think about it. All right? Take a fucking look. Yeah. Look at her. She's fucking practically catatonic in there, you know? Yeah. So what? She's a cunt. But I was lucky to have her. And so were you. Fuck off with this shit. What do you mean, fuck off, dude? You can't just talk to somebody that way. It's your fucking mother, right? - Yeah, it's my mother. Would you talk to someone on the street that way? No. Would someone on the street that way treat me that way? Yeah. And you said your piece, and now she's a fucking wreck. You're not even fucking related to her. - So what? I... - What? Dude, I don't talk to fucking anyone that way. You shared your feelings. You're fucking talking to me that way. Yeah. No. Because you fucking said it to me. What did I get to say to you, huh? 'Cause I was standing in the back of the fucking room 'cause I fucking sang a song, and you fucking blew up on us? - Lower your voice. - So we... Lower my voice. All right. That's fucking rich coming from you. Lower my voice in the fucking house? You were fucking screaming. Screaming. You know what? You didn't even come to talk to me afterwards. Right? So I'm talking to you right fucking now. I was gonna let it go. Take a fucking look, brother. I mean, Jeff... There's no food here. Folks are hungry. Tony's hungry. I mean, you want to fucking hear Kevin? I mean, you know how he fucking gets. All right. She's having a great time. - I know. 'Cause she's not related. She can just fucking leave. I don't have a car. Uh, what are we eating? - We'll go get pizza. - That sounds great. Pizza sounds awesome. - Fucking jerk-off. - It's something. It's something. Just make sure you get me a fucking pepperoni, or I'm gonna lose my shit. - Naomi? - Yeah? Is there a good place? No, it's a terrible place, but come with me. Smell. - Nostalgia? It's my childhood. You're gonna love it when you come every year now. - Oh, God. Don't. - Hello. We need some pizzas for a big family. At least six? - Mm-hmm. Let's do four large cheese. Everybody loves cheese. I need one large pepperoni, one large linguiça. And you want something special? Garlic knots. - What? Garlic knots. - Garlic knots. Garlic knots for the guest. All righty. Don't worry about contributing. I got it. No, I wasn't going to. - Bobby? - Hey, what's up, buddy? How you doing? Do you know that guy? Um, yeah, I do. He's not ev... Yeah. Hey. What do you know, right? Weird. Good to see you. I'm Bobby, by the way. I'm his sponsor. He's my sponsor. We're in Alcoholics Anonymous together. We don't... You know, we don't drink, right? We, uh... Bob. - What? - What are you doing here? All right, fine, Jeff. I called your wife, and I asked her what town you were in, and I was hoping I'd bump into you. Okay, you haven't called me. You're not answering your phone. - I'm sorry. - I mean, I'm on the ropes with this sobriety stuff, brother. I need you. I'm sorry. I have not... I haven't been fair to you, and I'm sorry. I really am. - It's okay. - It's not okay. I mean, I'm your sponsor, and I just... I've left you hanging. - No. No, dude, it's... It's okay. No one's ever apologized to me before. Ever. It's just, I'm dealing with this family shit. Are you all right? I mean, no, I'm not. I-I'm going crazy. I want a fucking drink so bad. Just out of boredom. I mean, I got nothing to do. I got no friends. They all drink. I'm a fucking loser. Do you know how good a drink would taste right now? Just one drink, and it would all disappear. But it wouldn't. And you haven't drank, right? No. no, 33 days. Look at that. I mean, you're up against some serious obstacles and you haven't drank. I'm up here with my family right now, and they all drink. They try to get me to drink, and it sucks, but I know how to deal with that now. But it took me two years to get to that place. And you got some friends you'll be able to go back to. And some you won't, but fuck them. It gives you something to work for. Yeah. But it fucking sucks though, right? I don't know. Does it? Would you like it to be like it was before? No, no, I don't want to go back to that, ever. Look, here's the thing. You can't think about the first drink. Think about the last drunk. What was it like the last time you drank? I can't say that in front of a lady. I mean, you want to go back to that? Having nights that you can't even talk about in front of a nice woman? I get it. Okay. I, uh... Point made. Oh, my God, dude. So, what's this... What's the family stuff you're going through? What's... What's happening? It's just... It's my own shit. Stuff I'm trying to work out. Beth and I are trying to have a kid, but I got shit I got to deal with first. What shit? You don't have a kid? Fuck your wife. That's it. No, I know. I just... I don't think I'm cut out to be a dad. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. I was just thinking that. Are you crazy? Look at me. You would be a great dad. Absolutely. I can see you with a kid. You are a dad. No-brainer. You're a dad, man. These fucking people. - That's your family? - Yep. They look cool. Amazing. They're about to come in like animals, so... What's up, guys? - They got pizza. Come on, we got a bunch of pies. No pineapple. What do you mean, no pineapple? It's real tasty. Do you put tomato sauce on your blueberries? You need to broaden your horizons. Everybody, everybody. This is Bobby. He's my friend. Hello, Bobby. Beer's in the fridge. No, thanks. - This is our Uncle Kevin. - Hey, Kev, how are ya? - His wife, Tricia. - Hey, Trish. - Darlene. - Darlene. - Mark. - Mark. - Brenda. - Brenda. - Tony. He's Italian. - Tony. What's up, buddy? - Hey. - So, anyways... Pizza for the 4th of July? Yeah, I just... I thought it was easy. Save you some trouble. Pepperoni for your father? Yeah, of course. One linguiça. Okay. I'll serve it. Girls, bring it out. Thank Christ! Hey, Dad. - You get pepperoni? - Yeah, of course. I... Oh. Oh, you better... You better take that call. Um... No, no. Y-You take it. It's your wife. Okay. Hey. Hey, Dad. Thank you. I have so much to tell you. Jeff, I went to the doctor yesterday. I figured since you were talking about this, seriously, I should get myself checked out. And he basically said, "No way." No way? Yeah, it's too late. My tubes or whatever. Basically said it's just never gonna happen. Wait. Just no? I mean... When does a doctor say just no? I mean, there must be something. I mean, yeah, we could... We could have done in vitro or some other stuff. I don't know, Jeff. Maybe it is too late. Maybe it's better this way. I don't know if I'm cut out for this. Okay. All right. Maybe you're right. Maybe it's too late, but maybe it's not. How about... when I get home, we'll talk about it? Okay. I'm sorry. Sorry? You don't have to be sorry. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Never mind me. I'm fine. I mean, look, we don't know what's gonna happen, but I feel like I know one thing. What's that? It's gonna be okay. And if it isn't okay, that'll be okay. I love you. I love you, too. Good. We're gonna be fine either way, right? Yeah. I promise. I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah. You will. I love you. Is that considered sausage, you mean? Looks like a belly-button innie. You shouldn't hug your mother like that. I can't condone it. Hey, Kevy. Happy 4th of July. - You didn't give me a slice.
