[ Whistles ] [ Growling ] It's our new home, Felix. We've seen worse. [ Growling softly ] Hey, Felix, don't go too far. [ Growling ] Oh, susie. Hey, what the fuck are you doing here? Get out of my house. What do you mean your house? I mean my house. Now get out. Who the fuck are you? Get out. Now. Whoever you are, mister, this is my place. Hey, are you deaf? I said my place. It's not your place anymore. Hey. Close the door. Where were you? You could have barked or something. That's better. I know what you're thinking. There's no way you and me are going to settle down. Not yet anyway. First we got a job to do. Tough guy, huh? [ Thumps truck ] Felix. Come on, pal. Come on, we got lots to do. Hey, Felix. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Felix. You playing games again? [ Whistles ] Hey, Felix. [ Whistles ] Oh, there you are. Okay, partner, in the back. Can I help you? Any of these horses for sale? Every one of them. [ Neighing ] I don't know why they're so nervous. They're good animals. Maybe they smell something upwind. Used to be the old mountain lions would spook them but hell, we've hunted all them down. Yeah. Easy, girl. Easy, easy. Yeah, that's okay. I know what you're smelling. It's me. Come here, friend. Come here, come here. It's okay. Yeah, yeah, that's okay. She likes you. Where did you say you were from? I like her. I'll take her. How much? Well, she ain't been broke yet. But I'll make you a good price. I'd like you to deliver her to the Colton ranch with some feed. Hell, that place is abandoned. Not anymore. You a relative of that poor family? You heard what happened to them, didn't you? You want to sell the horse or not? Yahoo! [ Whooping ] Woman: What are you doing? Bastards! Nice stuff. Hey, Katie. Did I ever tell you... What do you guys want with me? Just pay and leave. You got a gorgeous ass. Howdy. Woman: Please... Man: What are you-- cold? Are you cold? Say, young fella reckon you're kind of new in these parts, huh? That's right. Some buzzwagon you got outside. Yeah. Excuse me, please. Woman: Leave me alone! Come on! You heading on down to work on the rigs? Woman: Just go away! [ Men laughing ] Woman: Stop! You see, I'm the preacher here and we don't want trouble in this town. No, sir. You see, it's quiet here. Always has been. That's good. Stop! Come on. Don't be so unfair. I just want you to understand. We don't want any trouble. You guys stop! There's plenty of work down galveston way. Preacher, please tell them to stop. What are you going to say-- "oh, bless you, my son"? They don't mean any harm. You're not from around here. You just don't understand the situation. Which one of you gentlemen's going to clean up this mess? What did you say? Let the girl go. I think she likes it. She likes it. Freeze. Careful, he's packing a gun. Okay, I'll pay for the beer. Come on, come on, it's cool. All right, we're leaving. We're out of here. We're gone. Bye now. I really don't need a shotgun. I'll just take what I have here and leave if you don't mind. Don't even move, slick. Let me guess. You don't get a lot of return business around here. I mean it's not exactly your friendly neighborhood store. Just put your hands up slowly. No, I would suggest that you put the shotgun on the counter and move out slowly. Now why would I do a thing like that? [ Gasps ] Felix, get back in the truck. Go on. Now. Felix? He is pretty civilized for a cougar. Can I pay for these? Thank you. You work nearby? You buying a place around here? Nope. Well, I guess you're not the talkative type. I guess not. That will be $21.60. Do I know you? I don't know. Maybe you do. Carrie. How do you know my name? It's written on the counter. That's him. Remember me? You got some explaining to do, boy. You come into town. You hurt my friend. It's not real smart. Yeah, you're going to pay for this. Hey, Felix, why don't you say hello? [ Growling ] Felix. Want a beer? I don't want your beer. I want to cut you up. Son of a bitch. Hey, you! How would you like to mess with someone your own size? These guys are beginning to get on my nerves. Next one's going to hurt. Get out of here. Okay. We're leaving. This ain't over yet. One lump or two? You know, I don't think you should be doing that. In fact, I think it would be better if you kind of left town. You don't know what goes on around here. You're a stranger. What do you say, Felix? I think she's pretty. Not interested, huh? [ Engine revving ] [ Men laughing ] Damn. Come on. [ Engine backfiring ] You just watch it. What a day. See you tomorrow, Katie. Bye. Biker: Hey, make sure the rope is tight. Hey, want my skateboard? Shut up. [ Horn honking ] Hi, cutie. Want some company? Sure. Get lost. Yeah, let's party. All right. You're a hunk. He's moving into the Colton place? He already did. Was he alone? Don't really know, boss. Find out. I don't want strangers crawling through goldcrest. Find out. Then we'll give him a little bit of a welcome party. Yeah, come on. Come on. That a girl. Yeah, come on. Come on. Pick it up. Hyah! Pick it up. Yeah. Come on. [ Whistling ] Yah! Hyah! [ Clucking sound ] Yeah. Pick it up. Come on, come on. Come on. [ Clucking sound ] Come on. Hi. Morning. Nice horse. Uh-huh. Hyah! I just came out to tell you something after what you did yesterday. Whoa. What's that? Since I was a little girl all the trash from the surrounding counties gathered here in goldcrest. Have for years. They love it here. Really? Why not? The law doesn't take care of things. How do people survive around here, anyway? They work at the airport for a shipping company run by sheriff whistler. You want to give me your foot, pal? Come on. That's it. Well, is that all you came to tell me? Shoot, do you think I used this as an excuse to come out here? I don't know. Did you? Boost me up. You ridden a horse before? Once or twice. Once or twice, huh? Mm-hmm. Come on, girl. Come on around. Come on. That's it. That's it. That's a girl. That's him, boss. Okay, go get him. Alive. Let's party, boys. Colton: Come on around. Come on. Easy. That's it. That's it. Come on. Yeah, easy, girl. Easy now. Come on. That's okay. Yeah, that's okay. Bring her on over here. Bring her to me. [ Gunshots ] Whoa, whoa. Get out of here! Come on, come on! [ Gunshots ] Get out of here. Get! Go! Come on. [ Laughing ] I'm going to cut you up. Asshole. Freeze, asshole. I'm going to blow her brains out. Leave me alone, you big ape! Come on, man. Think you're smart, huh? Take this. What you looking at? That's a hell of a show you put on. I'm a deputy. All these boys here are unofficial deputies. And you owe my boys an apology. I want to make this son of a bitch drink puke cocktail. You animals. What do you want from him? It's only fair, Carrie. You know, an eye for an eye, a puke for a puke. Why don't you tell US your name, stranger? Be a shame not to know it when we take you to the hospital... Or the cemetery. Oh, I get it. He's the strong, silent type. John Wayne's his name, boys. He's from hollyweird. Ferret. Open wide, big boy. Hold on, Chuck. Everything in its time. I'm interested in this man's story. What made a sorry asshole like you come here to goldcrest, huh? Well, looky, looky, looky. A gomer. We got ourselves a gomer, boys. Wash out his mouth and then we're going to stick a Roman candle up his butt. I hate fucking gomers. Shit. I need a funnel. In the kitchen. You son of a... Hold on, Chuck. What did he say? In the kitchen? Well, by all means. Grease, in the kitchen. You think you're playing with kids, huh? Come on, grease! All right, I'm looking, I'm looking. All right, I got it, I got it. [ Screaming ] Whoa, shit! There's a freaking cat in there! Say good-bye to your pussycat. No! Felix, in the house-- now. Somebody's going to get shot. I've been shot before. I lived. You won't. You're lucky. I got better things to do right now. Let's go. I said let's go. Yeah, I'll see you. You all right? Yeah. Can I ask you something? What, do I have a choice? Sure. Who are you? What are you doing in goldcrest? Carrie, I lived in this house when you won the 60-yard dash. What? I... I don't understand. What are you trying to say? What I'm trying to say is, you used to know me. Carrie, I'm will. Will Colton. Will Colton? But you're dead. What happened to you? Um... I, uh... I'll see you later. You be careful. Yeah. I still can't believe that's will Colton. Neither could I. I swear I'm going to put up a sign that says: "Yes, that really is him." But now I don't know why he's come back. And that is a real cougar he has. But I don't know why he has it. I think it's so exciting. I hate to think what they're going to do to him. What do you think, pal? Looks pretty good, huh? Yeah, I get the same feeling. Well, we better start getting ready for them. Come on, Felix. No more roaming. Get in the house. Go on. All right, we're ready for them. Stay out of sight. If he leaves the house, go down and torch it. Then get back to me. Okay, boss. Ferret. You fall asleep, I'll break your neck. Yeah, all right. Everybody knows what's going on here but nobody wants to admit it. The stranger's trouble. He's just not scared of them. Everyone benefits in some way from this situation. Carrie: Ned, I can't believe you said that. Your family goes back to the alamo. The alamo! He's like Davy Crockett. Davy Crockett. "King of the wild frontier." Okay, folks. Store's closing. Everybody out for a while. Let's go. Carrie: Now what does he want? Let's go. Get out of my store, you sons of bitches. Watch your language. What would your poor, departed daddy say if he heard you talking like that? Don't you talk about my daddy. I could pull the trigger right now. You know you deserve it. You still think I killed your daddy? You had me tried for murder. The jury found it in their hearts to acquit me. There were no witnesses to any such crime. You bastard. You're not convinced. Then go ahead. Bring some vigilante justice to goldcrest. Go ahead. Shoot me. Can't do it? Guess that means I'm innocent. One of these days, somebody's going to make you pay for your crime. Enough of this bullshit. What I want to know is did your prince charming come here alone? Go to hell. I'll give you three to answer me. One... Now, I have no trouble pulling a trigger. Two... I don't know. You know I'll do it. Three! [ Bikers laughing ] Goddamn. You must be too busy humping him to find out. Get over here. Don't you get the reality around here? Why do you think your precious store never gets torched? Or your car never gets stolen? Or you never get raped? 'Cause I like you! Now tell me. Who the fuck is he and what does he want? Who's with him? I don't know. I think your memory needs... ...stimulating. Is he alone? I don't know. [ Punching ] [ Crying ] You like him, huh? You're going to tell me one way or another. Leave me alone. [ Explosion ] Hey, our bikes! What's going on?! What in hell is going on? What's the deal here? Where is he? I'm going to kill him. [ Gunshots ] This time it's loaded, ghost. Let's get the hell out of here. I thought I told you to watch him. But look. He's still there. He's sitting in the window. That's a dummy, you idiot. Let's go down there and burn that place. Yee-ha! Let's go do it. Let's do it! Come on! The dummy's shooting at US. Let's go, man. Move! Get in. Step on it. Step on it. This is sheriff whistler. Give me somebody who speaks English! Goddamn foreigners. Yeah. Yeah, I want to make sure that the money and the plane arrive at the same time. Also, I want 130 new kilos. That's right, and some fresh paint. Some fresh paint! Thank you. I'll talk to you later. Prostitute: Lonely tonight, hon? How about some company? Is that him? Yeah. Can I have a draft? Sure. A buck? Yeah, thanks. Hi. This is my cousin, Charlotte. Hello, Charlotte. I think I'll just visit the ladies room. See you. Can I sit down? Yeah, be my guest. You want a beer? You probably think we followed you here. You're right. I called a town meeting at the elks lodge for tomorrow night. And? Ghost's shipping company is just a cover for his smuggling of drugs and weapons. He and his gang have run this town for years. Carrie, why don't you take this information to the sheriff? I don't trust him. You think he's involved? I think so. If we got inside the walls of the shipping company a lot of questions would be answered. I don't mean to interrupt but we got to make some calls for the meeting. Okay, let's go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell ghost not to call me anymore. I got this here bar and a little cajun woman. I don't want to be messed with. Tell Ben to fix more of those in the back. Something's up, man. He needs you. If he needs me so bad, why ain't he here? He's busy, redd. All US five, we need... Listen, snot rag. You were sucking on a bottle when I was riding with the vipers. Those days are gone. Now get out of here. He made a mess here. You don't look like you know any better so I'll just take your twenty. Long way from home, ain't you? Maybe. You sure don't look happy. Don't you like it here in Texas? Matter of fact you look downright queasy. I hope it ain't my beer. Ask you a question? Why not? Does the name Colton mean anything to you? Come on, man, you remember. The Colton family? My mother... My father... My sister. Police radio: Meadows? Come in, meadows. Go ahead, sheriff. What the hell is going on? Well, I'm down at the red rooster. There's been an accident and red seems to have got himself killed. What happened? I'm working on that now. Red was, uh... I've known him many years. He was a solid member of the business community. He was a f... Have you arrested the perpetrator? It seems like self-defense. There's dozens of eyewitnesses around. Arrest him anyway. I'll take care of the eyewitnesses. But, sheriff... No buts about it! Goddamn it, just do it! You may be doing all the work but I'm still in charge. Don't you forget it. Yes, sir. We just heard about red. We got to do something about this crazy gomer and his friends. Why? Have you found out who they are? I'm tired of waiting. Let's waste him and worry about his friends later. That worked before. But that was then. This is now. We've got to grow with the business. We've got to keep a low profile. Are you going blind in that three-piece suit? This guy wants US. That's no shit, man. He's weird. He's big, but he moves like a lizard. Aha, but he could be anybody. He could be a loony, or he could be a terrorist trying to spook US into a better price. I'm telling you, the goddamn Iranians-- they'd rather blow up the world than to give me a fair price! Why's he staying at the Colton ranch? Why does he say it's his? And why did he kill red? What the fuck has he got against me? He's got a shitty attitude. The bottom line is why wait? I've ordered the man arrested. Don't worry, ghost. I'll find out who he is. But in the meantime let's go downstairs and enjoy our goods. Let's have a drink and relax. You got to learn to relax. I think we're making a big mistake. You think we're making a big mistake? Mm-hmm. Ghost, if he comes after you and me... [ Laughing ] He got to be a loony. [ Moaning ] William, how do you know? Because I saw the whole thing. They killed him in cold blood. I saw it. And they saw me. [ Gunshots ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] Leave me alone! Please! Don't! [ Gunshot ] No! No! Please! Leave me alone! It's all right, pal. It's only a nightmare. Patricia, James, have some coffee and cake. Thank you. Let's wait a bit longer. I'm hoping for a few more people. Say good night. Pass it out to the boys. Tell them to have a little fun. Boys! I want you to have a little fun! [ Laughing ] Man: Hey, baby, do some. What the hell are you doing?! I was just going over some papers... Shit! Ghost! Whistler! Come on! [ Screaming ] Hey, you! Whistler! Somebody's killed z.Z.! Block all the exits! Ghost, I want that son of a bitch personally! Move it, you sons of bitches! Move it! Goddamn it! [ Machine gun firing ] [ Gunshot ] There he is! [ Bursts of gunfire ] Let's get him! [ Gunfire ] Biker: Let's go! This guy's nuts! First of all, I would like to thank all of you who have the courage to be here tonight. I know it's not easy to take a stand. My daddy did. Look what happened to him. Ghost and his gang murdered him in cold blood. Well, now will Colton is back in town. His family was butchered by that gang of thugs, drug smugglers and gunrunners. We've been terrorized and humiliated. We've kept silent for years. Well, now we've got the chance to get back our self-respect. I want this town to wake up. [ Whooping ] It's you again. What do you want, ghost? This is a private meeting. Ghost: Nice. Real nice. Town meeting. What's it all about? It ain't about nothing, ghost, really. Says "concerned citizens." What you all concerned about? Carrie: We're fed up with you, ghost. For years you've gotten away with dealing drugs, smuggling, rape, murder. Everybody knows you killed my daddy and the witnesses. Preacher, I think she needs your help. She's confused. She ain't making any sense anymore. She's obsessed. Tell these good folks that there ain't any proof to anything she's saying. Go on. [ Mumbling: ] There's no proof. I don't think they heard you. There's no proof. Then I don't need any proof. 'Cause I'm going to kill you right now! Woman: Oh, my god! You shoot me, and you're dead. I'll do one good thing before I die. Hold it! He's gone out the back! Get to the bikes! You're hurt! Let me drive. Okay, go! Come on! They're coming closer! Hang on. Let's get him! Will! I can't stop! What? [ Tires screeching ] [ Door opens ] Damn rain. Any word on that Colton boy yet, meadows? No, sir. We haven't been able to track him yet, sir. The weather's not exactly helping, sheriff. I'm running a check on him now, sheriff. You are, huh? Yes, sir. I know who will Colton is. I don't need no file. I want him. But, sheriff... You don't understand how texans get things done do you, boy? You stick to that piece-of-shit computer and let me handle the law. Huh? Yes, sir. "Coup attempt in Sudan. One man army..." Oh, great. Yeah, operator? F.b.i., Washington, please. Oh, no! Oh, god! Why did you have to come after me? I told you there were too many for one person. Why did you have to die? [ Groaning ] You're not dead. No, I'm sorry. I saw you get hit. Yeah. I got a bulletproof vest on. Oh... It still hurts like hell. Maybe if you just gave me another kiss it would take away some of the... Sorry. It's okay. It's okay. [ Grunting ] Sorry. It's okay. I'm not very good at this. I can see you're no stranger to pain. Did you get these scars in the marines? Yeah, some of them. I was a mercenary for a few years. I remember the will Colton I knew. What happened to you, will? What happened that night? They killed my family one by one. Dumped US in the river. I was the only one who survived. Ghost was there and whistler was there. I don't know. I think he was in charge. I can't remember. When I woke up, I was in the hospital. They kept asking me my name and I didn't want to tell them. I was afraid. Somehow I got out of there. I don't know how but I got out of there. But I survived and I've been a survivor ever since. Why did you come back? To stop the dreams and the nightmares. How long has it been since you kissed a woman? [ Growling ] [ Loud growling ] Get out of here. [ Snarling ] Get back in the kitchen. [ Growling ] Morning. Morning. I wish we never had to leave this place. Carrie, I'm sure they know we're here. [ Growling ] Felix? [ Growling ] Felix? See what's happening. Jimmy, snake... Go check out the scene. [ Growling ] You all right, pal? [ Growling ] What's wrong? [ Growling ] What is it? He senses something out there. [ Growling ] Felix... Felix! Felix! [ Gunshot ] [ Snarling ] [ Screaming ] Felix! [ Gunshot ] Felix? Will! Will! Get in! [ Gunshots ] Take a window. Come on! Come on! [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Gunshots ] [ Whinnying ] Go on, go! [ Gunshots ] [ Whinnying ] [ Screaming ] What's the matter with you? He's just one guy. He's got traps. Burn him. Use these. All right. Shit. [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] Carrie, get away from him. [ Screaming ] Will! Carrie, get down! [ Screaming ] Burn, will Colton. Go back to hell. It doesn't look good. What now? I don't know. [ Explosion ] [ Screaming ] Do you love me? What? Do you love me? You're asking me this now? Yeah. You love me? Yeah. Get the hell out of here. What's that noise? I don't know. [ Yelling ] Meadows. What's he doing here? [ Crowd shouting ] [ Cheering ] What the hell's going on? We're history. Let's get out of here. Shit. [ Cheering ] Son of a bitch! We know one damn thing. He's been working with that little spitfire at the store. She should have been taken care of. Well, what are you looking at? Go get her. Now. Good-bye, partner. You were the only real friend I ever had. I don't know how I'm going to make it without you. Will, I'm sorry to interrupt. It's Carrie. What about her? She's been kidnapped. What? By whistler. Can I help? Why? I need to. Get every piece of scrap metal you can. Meet me in town in 15 minutes. You going to kill me too? If you get hurt it's because your boyfriend's coming here to be a hero. You're just insurance. The whole town's against you. You're finished. Yeah, maybe. But there are other places. And you're coming with me. You killed my daddy. You need a daddy? I'll be you're daddy. Call me daddy. Go ahead, call me daddy. Call me daddy. Hey. Hey! Will you cut out this kind of shit? We got work to do. Christ's sake. I'll be back. Learn to say it real soft... [ Whispering: ] Like "daddy, daddy." I like it that way. Well, what do you think? How did you..? Everybody pitched in. Will it be ready on time? Sure. Do you think it's strong enough to break through? We'll find out. Do you know what to do? Uh-huh. See you inside. Hey, preacher... Yeah. Thanks. Okay, guys, come on. Get back to work. [ Airport signal buzzing ] Howdy. How you doing? What do you think? Show US what you have. You name it, I got it. What do I have... Huh? There. Huh? Seems all right. Yes, sir. Hoo, hoo, hoo! Don't shoot. Looks good. Everything's in order. Here's the money we agreed on. And here we have the confirmation of transfer to the Swiss account. Well, don't stand there second port side of a dead chicken. Load the plane. Oh, there's been a slight change. How's that? Don't leave without ghost and me. Got it. All right. [ Chuckling: ] Paradise, here we come. [ Screaming ] [ Neck cracking ] [ Groaning ] [ Muffled voices ] Where's the girl? Where is the girl? Carrie. Will? You okay? Yeah. I'll get you out of these. Come on, come on, come on. So long, baby. Is that a bomb? Yeah. That's enough explosives to blow up this whole place. What's that? It's a timer connected to a radio receiver. But it's not set. You listen to me. You stay here. With the bomb? You'll be okay. You trust me. Come on. You stay here. I'll be back for you. Something's wrong. Why is he waiting? Take it easy. He knows what he's doing. Whistler: Will you move that goddamn thing? Move it out. All right clear those forklifts away from the plane. Clear all personnel off the runway. I can't believe this is really happening. Now is a good time to board the plane. Why don't you go get your stewardess and I'll get the money. [ Laughing ] Shit! Whistler, the girl's gone! [ Alarm buzzing ] He's in the building. Let's get the hell out of here. [ Alarm buzzing ] That's it. Let's go. That's not the signal. I don't care. He may be in trouble. [ Gunfire ] All right! Whistler: Will you get your lead out of your ass? The plane's leaving. [ Sirens wailing ] Shoot the son of a bitch! Preacher! Hurry up. Damn, it's the f.B.I. Get on the plane. What the hell do you think I'm trying to do, you dip shit? Okay. I'll go get some help. Man, it's the cops. Let's get out of here. Hold it! Drop your guns. I'm getting too old for this shit. Well, we made it. Call Carrie. Okay. Preacher. For the first time in a long time... You know, I really feel great. Just... There's something I didn't tell you. I saw ghost kill your father. Carrie... Please forgive me. I forgive you. You know what? I'm going to be sorry about one thing though-- not being able to see that asshole really die. Whoa! What are you talking about? I got a little surprise for them. What is that? Oh, I didn't tell you about it. Right here. I want to show you. There, you see that? What's that? It's a timer. I just set it. And in a few minutes, that whole warehouse is going to go boom. What are you talking about? Well, goddamn. The police will think we blew up with it. Nobody will ever look for US again. And guess who'll get the blame for the massacre. I guess I will. What the fuck?! Oh, no, ghost. Don't shoot him yet. I want him to see his girlfriend get blown sky high. Then can I kill him? Before you do that there's something you should know. You know the crate with the bomb in it? It's on the airplane. Then why you got that shit-eating grin on your face? You got the radio transmitter. Check it out. [ Beeping ] Shit. What? Oh, shit! It's true? It's on the fucking plane! Where is it? You tell me or I'll blow your goddamn head off. Go ahead. You think you're smart? Yeah. Takes out the missiles, terrorists and you two at once. And you, too, motherfucker. Will you get back here? What does it look like? Whistler: It's in a brown box with yellow writing. It's not here. It's up here. Come on. Why the hell did you have to put a bomb on? That's it. This is it? That's it. [ Beeping ] Adios. Fix it! [ Engines roaring ] [ Sirens wailing ] Will! Yeah! All right. [ Wolf whistle ]
