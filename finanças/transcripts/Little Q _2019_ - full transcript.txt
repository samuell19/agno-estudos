Mr. Lee I don't think my cake has any problem there is no problem with the cake cause the problem is on you the portion of cherry mousse and black chocolate is wrong your cake is too loosen one more thing can't you see there is water stain on the fork you miss the important details how are you different from a blind person a good chef needs all five of his senses to be sensitive you can't leave out a single one the appearances of these three cakes I have seen that before... Go away! Hello - hello, brother this is ah keung... can you hear me? I am blind not deaf po yi gave me your red packet what does that mean? You are not heading back again?

I have discussed with brothers we will drive to your place and bring you to Guangzhou directly no hassle at all I will take care of you brother, don't care about how others think it has been such a long time all gossips have died down nobody will keep an eye on you I won't know anyway! Stay away from me! Come over I told you to stay away go away! Go I! Go away! Mr. Lee Go back Mr. Lee, you are such an asshole if you don't want her, you shouldn't have adopted her it was pouring last night I tried giving her food but she refused I tried asking her to shelter but she ignored she simply hid under the car, staring at your window listen!

See you at the shop Why aren't you eating? Good morning. Mr. Lee miss Lee said she needed to take her kid to school and she will meet us at the shop noted Mr. Lee may I ask, have you fed q on time? I did feed her on time but you have to ask her if she is eating properly did you feed her any human food? Are we going out or not? All I want to know is why q is not eating I do not have time to study her I need to go to work aren't you here to check how she takes me to work? Mr. Lee, you can relax a bit Do you know why q stopped? I know. There is a kerb I remember that "forward" What now?

We will make them again not only these two all the cakes you made earlier throw all of them away yes, chef hold on... You have not tried this one yet they couldn't handle even the easy ones you still think I should try the rest? Brother I have tried all of them I don't see anything wrong that's why you won't be me throw these crap away and redo them again "busy"... Come on, girl "busy"... "Busy"... Good girl what's the matter with him? Q didn't eat because you didn't bring her out to "busy" as her owner, you have the responsibility to take good care of her I'm so occupied with my work and I still need to take care this kind of matters? It was you who chose q for sure you have to take care... Leave me alone! - It is dented here too - "Forward" Mr. Lee, there is a car in front of you - "forward"... - Mr. Lee, watch out! - Are you okay? - What's wrong with you? Can't you see there's a car parking right here? - Are you blind? - Yes. I am Mr. Lee, you need to trust q she is a well-trained guide dog she can make her own judgement given the situation if she thinks you are in danger she will definitely stop "left" Mr. Lee, you were lucky that the Van was not moving if not, you wouldn't have had any chance to hear me nagging the guide dog is not only there to guide you but also to protect you she is like your pair of eyes for the upcoming month I will keep track on how the pairing between you two without prior notice whatever! Dogs are very loyal to them you are their only master please give yourself and q more trust "find the door" many visually impaired think that their own world is small but after having your own guide dog, I believe you can find a new life being blind is my new life keep an open mind and let q help you I scolded at you! Why are you still coming to me? "Busy" "busy"... "Busy"... "Up stand" five times a day you even need help to go "busy" how can I rely on you to help me "find the chair" "Close" "down" New life? Picking up poop and cleaning pee is my new life staying with me is your new life do you like it? "Up stand" I don't have a choice, but you do leave you can leave now go away! Table for two - okay we are the next Quickly take it to table three - are these two ready? - Yes Haven't been here for a while. Which one are you picking? Tiramisu, I heard that it is delicious I read a magazine mentioning that there is some problem with the head chefs eyes are the cakes still delicious? Sure they are his apprentices are in charge now the cakes are still up to their standard Your apprentices have been following the methods you taught them yet they are not you, they can't meet your standard in your mind there are always things that you have to compromise "right" "Forward" "Forward" "right" Mr. Lee. Your have contracted pigmetosa retinitis what does that mean? For your case, in three years you will lose your vision completely why do you have to be so defensive? Everyone are just trying to help you I don't need people to pity me you are mad not because they failed to meet your standard it is because you don't even know what do you want "Stay" Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee, are you alright? Mr. Lee, did you get hurt? I am fine Brother. Where have you been? Brother... I am fine I just went out for a walk I am tried, wanna go home now I got to go I think we should take little q back if it wasn't for Dr. io's sake, we wouldn't have had little q paired with him I agree judging from his attitude during the initial training he surely didn't want a guide dog Simon, you are in charge of his case any opinion? Can we give him another chance? At first, I was like you guys, I hated this guy a lot little q was doing such a great job I couldn't understand why he would treat her in such a way but what happened just now showed me the real Lee po ting we train guide dogs in order to help the visually impaired to find a new path Mr. Lee is in need of our help now we shouldn't abandon him Can I pet her? Q, "go" Sorry Q, "heel" Mr. Lee we have decided to terminate your pairing with little q I am sorry "Forward" Morning - morning... Here, flowers for you do they smell good?

I will bring her let's go, q lazy girl Get up, q How long has q been like this? I brought her here as soon as I realized this morning hip arthritis is pretty common among guide dogs they have to walk more compare to other dogs so their joints deteriorate much quicker what can we do to help her? Keep an eye on her weight if she struggles to get up, give her a hand remember, she still needs to excercise to strengthen her joints q, try this I know this is your favourite treat good girl it is rather normal for dog at this age to have health problems We will arrive soon good doctor said you have to excercise to stay healthy that is to say the little prince and the little fox... The story of the little prince is like this the meaning is he is different from the usual ones I bought you a gift look it's a cake I didn't forget your birthday happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday to q happy birthday to you Why would it spread so quickly? Don't worry as long as she is medicated and has chemotherapy it should help for now chemo? Isn't it too much for her? Q's condition is not good would you consider euthanasia, so she won't suffer that much? No way I think q is not willing to do it too how much time does she have left? Six months Q has been waiting patiently because she can't let go of Mr. Lee we don't have the right to take away her only hope This way, no rush q... Q - q is in front of you I'm sorry that I haven't been taking good care of her it's ok, you did great I was really afraid that I won't see you again life is really fragile I thought that if I have a good doctor and I would recover soon yet operations after operations failed I was so close to death twice I thought I would have died but they found me a new heart so don't give up we just meet again Silly girl "Forward" Silly girl it is time now time to off duty I appreciate your hardwork thank you Hang on They are amazing I was really naughty when I was a child I messed up q's trainings luckily she was not affected by me I wonder if it was q who chose you or you chose her instead many visually impaired failed to find an appropriate guide dog throughout their whole life many people think guide dogs life are miserable, they have to work all the time with no freedom however, they stay with their owner all the time, they can share every single bits of life with their owners which is a kind of blessing I am the luckiest one in fact q has given me so much more than I deserve therefore no matter how much time she has left I will be with her Q like this place that much Everything remains the same, isn't it? That explains why q like this place that much it is beautiful and cozy here let's take a photo let me take it for you - okay let me do it can you handle this? Why not? Take it - q, let's take a photo - Let's take a selfie move the camera a little bit upward almost - more on yourself that's it... Three, two, one... cheese alright, let q have a rest it's pretty good great smile you're not in the frame in this one Help me to get q on the ground okay q, there we go q is up - hold her back one two three Go Go play I wonder what it looks like in the eyes of q people said dogs are colour blind they can only see black and white I think that's because they leave us the best colours The purity of an uncunning heart is the most beautiful always so openly expressing your true feelings without hesitation being Sincere and thoughtful there is endless love in your heart my life has no regrets because I met you we explore heaven and earth by each other's side I hope when we come to the end of our paths it will still be as beautiful as we've always known thank you for spending a life time supporting me and guiding me when I lost my way always being there for me everyday and when I feel down and out you so gently kiss me and calm my soul your endless care and concern your protecting me and looking out for me giving me love and loyal support forever in my heart today and in the future there will be your footprints guiding my every step in stride My life has no regrets because I met you we explore heaven and earth by each other's side I hope when we come to the end of our paths it will still be as beautiful as we've always known thank you for spending a life time supporting me and guiding me when I lost my way always being there for me everyday and when I feel down and out you so gently kiss me and calm my soul your endless care and concern your protecting me and looking out for me giving me love and loyal support forever in my heart today and in the future there will be your footprints your endless care and concern your protecting me and looking out for me giving me love and loyal support forever in my heart and in my sweetest dreams there will be your footprints guiding my every step in stride For a visually impaired, guide dog is a kind of hope my guide dog is called xiaojie this is mango, she is six years old my guide dog is called shaguo he is a golden retriever my guide dog is called dick he is a labrador I am especially willing to go to the park now with shaguo's accompany walking is of great convenience I love Deanna more than my grandkids because Deanna will never talk back to me and is obedient to me dogs and human must cooperate with each other when she first meets her owner it was a love at first sight gaga is our first guide dog gaga has a very good bonding with Gary, they are close with one another once on the mtr we found a seat and there was a girl next to me said you two didn't have a seat originally but your dog kept looking at the man with a pitiful face with gaga looking at him for a few seconds the man was embarrassed so he stood up to let us had the seat on our third day with candie we encountered an earthquake candie did not run or fled away but took me out of the building since then I knew I could not live without candie rally really can handle it, she managed to take care of me she will never put me in danger or make me frightened so I can go through any places unhindered we have been standing there for a long time both my dog and I thought that there is no car so we can go when we arrived in the middle a three-wheeled motorcycle suddenly appeared from nowhere she used her head to block my way trying her best to push me back which meant to urge me to move backward then there is this car it hit the head of my guide dog sometimes I do feel bad about my guide dog the dog is my family member, my child my pair of eyes their loyalty is of utmost that even my own children can't compare guide dogs were raised by a foster family after retirement, according to international practice they will be going back to their foster families the answer to whether I should raise her myself or send her back to the family, depends on which option will make she happier separation could be heart-breaking it feels like your daughter is leaving you candie, what do you want to hear from your mum? She will say, I want delicious, tasty and funny things, candie wants them all what I want to say to gaga is, thank you thank you you brought so much happiness to me I hope dick will live healthy and happily and has a peaceful mind Deanna stays beside me twenty four hours a day she is a companion who will never leave me after knowing the dog from the birth after me or someone else train the dog and after the training with the clients I think the most beautiful moment is when we decide they are ready to leave and work on their own
