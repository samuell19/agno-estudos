The stairway is dark... I don't recognise this hallway... Where are we? At our room now. I don't have the key... No, you gave it to me. I have it. What's wrong with me? This is the room? I don't recognise it... Take off your clothes. Sure. You know what whores do? Yes. They fuck. Do you want to fuck me? Just take off your clothes. I'll tell you what I want. Fine. I'm afraid. I'm afraid... Are you looking for something? Yes... - Are you looking to go in? - Yes. An opening? I look for an opening. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. Do you understand I look for an opening? Yes, I understand completely. Good. Good that you understand. It's fine. That's good! You understand! You didn't understand what I said? A half... Do you want... to see? You have to be wearing... the watch. You light a cigarette... you push and turn... right through the silk. You fold the silk over... and then... you look... through the hole. I didn't mean anything by that. I just asked a question. Why did you ask it if it means nothing? Whatever you want, is that it? No. Whatever you want. Oh... Now it's me. Always you. Lie to me, but don't lie to yourself. So sly... Don't push me! I'll push you to hell! Stop it! I can't give you children, I know that... Are you listening to me? I'm going out now. I'm not who you think I am! I'll never let you have her! Never... Excuse me, do you know the time? 9:45. Thank you. Cast out... this wicked dream... that has seized my heart. I almost didn't recognise you. You startled me. Strange... to find you on the street. You seem upset... Are you? Should I be? No, but... So I shouldn't be? No... but still, you seem so. I think you don't recognise me... my manner... That's true. You seem different. You too. I'm used to seeing you in our home... not on the street... at night. Me too. There was a murder... How awful... - Where? - Just down the way. I think... you knew the person. Who was it? Don't know the name... but I have seen you with this person. - You have? - Yes. I think... I've seen the two of you together. That's awful... This situation is becoming dangerous. What do you want? Where is he? What's the point? Are you blind? He's gone! Everybody? Why answer your stupid questions? You're nothing! You've done nothing! Where did he go? No idea. He talked... mumbled something about lnland Empire. There's someone there... I have to tell you... There's someone... Do you recognise her? I don't see her... You understand she sent for you? I don't know where I am... I hear her now... Do you see her? No. It was... red... You work for someone? Yes. This is the one who she spoke of. The one I work for. So... you understand. The horse was taken... to the well... Take the pistol... Let's go! Right away! it's after midnight. Hey, look at me, and tell me if you've known me before. You asked about the bus. You can get the bus for Pomona here... if you get on the subway first. You can go all around Hollywood... where I was, from Hollywood and Vine... and you can get to Pomona for $3.50... from Hollywood and Vine to Pomona. I went on the bus to Pomona last summer... to visit my friend who lives there. Her name is Niko. I stayed for two weeks. I don't know... it's after midnight. My friend Niko who lives in Pomona... has a blonde wig... she wears it at parties... but she is on hard drugs and turning tricks now. She looks very good in her blonde wig... just like a movie star. Even girls fall in love with her... when she is looking so good... in her blonde star wig. She blows kisses and laughs... but she has got a hole in her vagina wall... she has torn a hole... into her intestine... from her vagina. She has seen a doctor, but it is too expensive... and now she knows her time has run out. She scores a few more times... and then, like that... she will stay at home with her monkey... She has a pet monkey. This monkey shits everywhere, but she doesn't care... This monkey can scream, it screams like it's in a horror movie. But there are those who are good with animals...
