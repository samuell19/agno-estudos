That must be the village. He's dead? What? What? I'll signal Nairobi for a medical unit. Light. Light. Too bright! Open SA Channel G. The airplane. The light's coming from the airplane. We're all dead here! The intense burns evidently produce a corrosion of the nervous system. ...I should never have come. I had a good job.. I, I gave it all up. Cancel Channel G. And open overseas relay, Channel D, please. Channel D open. Connect me with Mr. Waverly. Mission Control. The transmission's coming from that shack, doctor. Force them into the open. 'Yes, Mr. Kuryakin, I'm ready for your report.' Yes, Mr. Kuryakin. I'm ready for your report. Forget it. I'm still waiting for your report, Mr. Kuryakin. Kuryakin here, sir. Sorry, we were interrupted. You can tell Security Research that their information was correct. Somebody has won the race to develop a thermal prism. In case you don't read the newspapers you can't extradite me from here. I want to talk to you over there. The rest of you go on doing whatever it is that you're doing. Would you please? The old man hasn't spoken in 20 years. The belief is that when he does, this mystic cult it's called the 3rd Way, will inherit the earth. You have interrupted a private ceremony, Mr. Solo. I see. My deepest apologies. - Shall we go? - Uh, no. No, no, no. Because of you, I've been driven halfway around the world and forced into hiding on this moldy island. 'So whatever you have to say to me' you can say here and now, and quickly. We'd like you to work for us on an assignment. Work for you? Well, you're wanted in 17 countries on charges of felonies, everything from grand theft... Uh, no, no, no. Your bookkeeping is a little off. - It's 22 countries. - My apology. However, if you cooperate with us we're prepared to offer you total amnesty. - All 22 countries? - All 22 countries. What, uh, kind of cooperation do you want? Well, I'm not prepared to give you the details 'but you're supposed to be the best safe cracker in the world.' 'You just have a chance to prove it.' Well, uh, I suppose I could use a shave at that. Gentleman, I, I want to thank you for your generous hospitality these past months. - I wanna thank you and I wa.. - Aah, aah, aah.. The old man. 'Look, he's going to speak.' A-a-ah. Uh, ah, aah. Uh, uh, ah. The old man won't speak in front of a stranger. It's supposed to be bad luck. I'm sorry. 'Hmm, the thermal prism.' Yes, yes, I see. No wonder you're so eager for help. You may turn the lights on now. You put that into orbit and you have the super-weapon of all time. I know because I tried to develop one myself. Unfortunately, I was unable to acquire the necessary materials. But now someone has developed it. Who? Dr. Parviz Kharmusi. - Oh, yes, yes, the noted.. - The noted.. The noted Persian scientist. Yes, I've heard of him. Mr. Solo is confirmed to arrive in Teheran at noon, sir. Good, I'll contact... What is it you want me to do exactly? I was about to get into that, Mr. Sebastian. Besides your ill manners, which I now observe at firsthand our computers have shown you to be the most efficient criminally oriented mind with advanced degrees in engineering, physics and chemistry. Apparently, you've avoided the humanities. It seems you designed the system while still in graduate school. And this Kharmusi keeps the thermal prism in a safe. If the tumbler circuits haven't been modified you should have no difficulty opening it. Even if they have, it shouldn't be any problem. Where is the safe? How do I get to it? This is a general outline of the Kharmusi estate. 'There's an electrical warning system around the perimeter.' 'There are guard towers here' 'here and here.' We jam their radar and then parachute in here just before daybreak. That gives us all day and most of the night to penetrate whatever warning systems and devices they have through this area until we ultimately reach the estate building itself. Mr. Solo will coordinate from inside the building. I like the way you put that very casually. We will penetrate their warning system. You can be sure that this Kharmusi will have top security. Now, look, Solo said this mission was dangerous but no one said anything about suicide. I will take you to the safe. Well, don't forget. I can only open it if I'm alive. If I fail, I'm willing to take full responsibility. 'Announcing the arrival of..' Hello. 'Who is expecting a call?' Napoleon Solo. 'And what would he like to hear?' - Directions. - '29, North East Avenue.' Alright. I'm Napoleon Solo. Perhaps you are expecting me. No...but he is. Hmm? Chamber of commerce. Come on, let's get the gear. 'Mr. Solo. Hey, Mr. Solo.' 'Mr. Solo.' I'm Annie Justin, Mr. Solo. I'm afraid there's been a terrible misunderstanding. Well, here's your ID card. I had no idea that you were an UNCLE agent. Are you seriously hurt? Is there anything I can do for you? Anything. No, no. Please don't. Where's your travelling companion? Oh, this is Hassan Aksoy, Mr. Solo. Perhaps you've heard of the four Aksoy brothers. 'Well, they were a circus act.' I don't care who he is or who you are or actually why I got hit. I'm a busy man. I've got another engagement, so I'm... Oh, no, wait a minute, Mr. Solo. Oh, we're looking for Luther Sebastian. At first, we thought you were working with him but I had no idea that you were bringing him to justice. If you could just tell us in which country he is going to... Uh, sorry. I can't help you right now. I've seen your act. Step aside. Oh, Hassan can't speak, Mr. Solo. Poor darling cut off his tongue doing a stunt. Alright, I don't want him to get hurt. Oh, don't worry about that. Your gun isn't loaded. He emptied the clip himself. Now you're a captive audience. You really must help me, Mr. Solo. You see my fiance, Hugh Winslow of the Beaconsfield Winslows well, he's in a Turkish prison because Sebastian framed him for a murder that he committed. I spent a whole year collecting evidence. I must free my poor Hugh from that awful prison. He's very frail. Hassan's brother, Ali shares a cell with my poor Hugh. Well, Sebastian framed Ali as well. Hassan gets very temperamental at times, Mr. Solo. So you'd better tell us where we can find Sebastian. We need Sebastian for something very important. When we're through with him, you can help yourself. Aren't you going to bring him to trial? If he does as he's supposed to the charges against him will be dropped. You've made some sort of deal with him, haven't you? You're going to let Sebastian go free. I look upon this as a minor setback, Mr. Solo. My bullet clip, please. Here. If you think I'm going to let poor Hugh wither away in prison just because of you.. 'Well, you haven't heard the last from us.' Nothing will stop us! He was reaching for a knife. You shouldn't have done that. I'm Azalea. Your identification, Mr. Solo. And your identification? I'm here to take you to your doctor's appointment. We're late, Mr. Solo. I'll meet you outside. This is a dangerous game. And I think you better leave it to the professionals. I don't think it was necessary to kill him. We'll never know for certain, will we? Kharmusi will observe you very closely. I hope you're prepared. Yes. If I get there alive. I'm supposed to pose as an American millionaire with a shadowy past. 'And the shadowy past is to cover up any inconsistencies.' There must not even be one, Mr. Solo. You must take no unnecessary chances. I know what you mean, ahem. Dr. Kharmusi's estate. Just one question. Why are you helping us? I'm his wife. Wait here. Fifty cents in loose change. Two fillings in the teeth. Wristwatch and money clip. Your room. Cocktails at 8:00. Thank you. Napoleon's inside. We're on schedule so far. Violence is your department. You'll, uh, think of something, I'm sure. You think anyone else knows we're here? Ah! Perhaps not. Let's hope these two won't be missed till evening. I must congratulate you on the way you handled them. Couldn't have done it without your help. Tell me, how are we, uh, supposed to get to that building? It's a sheer drop. When nightfall comes we go over and down. Mr. Solo, I presume. The mountain should put us on the blind side of their radar. I don't like it. Why should they turn 'em on now? You can worry about that later. Let's get moving. If you're in such a hurry, why don't you go on ahead? I'll meet you on the other side of the minefield. After you. Good. As I thought, sequence mines. How fortunate for me, Mr. Solo, that you should appear.. ...at this very moment in my life. Most fortunate indeed. I'm sure our association would be a mutual benefit, doctor. I understand all principals benefited from your syndicate financing a certain colonial administration in Africa. No, that was in the Southeast Asia, not Africa. Mm. My error. In any event, the thermal prism once in orbit will be a weapon that will give the balance of power to whichever country leases the device from us. We shall be able to command any price, Mr. Solo. 'I would say the profit picture looks very hopeful.' Perhaps I might see the prism for myself and any results of preliminary testing. There will be time for that, Mr. Solo. There's time now. Tomorrow, at our leisure... If you don't mind, doctor, I'd like to see it tonight. You see, I have to make contact with my associates tomorrow 'in order to place my resources at your disposal.' Such arrangements take time and there's little point in wasting any. I dislike being hurried.. ...by you, Mr. Solo. - You'll get used to it. - Yes. Yes. I am reduced to dealing with businessmen.. ...and an American at that. I understand your resources are no longer available. It is true, because of certain tragic instances in my private life. They were all lies. You understand? Gross lies. Obscene lies! It was a carefully drawn plot against me, I'm certain of that. On the face of it, their allegations were ludicrous. Allegations concerning proposals I had made. Anonymous firm calls the young ladies...students of mine. As you can see, Mr. Solo, my enemies will go to any length to discredit me. Oh, my Azalea.. ...she's the only one... to understand. I'm sure of that. The most undemanding woman. A good woman. Of course. Immediately. A surprise for Mr. Solo. And a surprise for us all. A young lady attempted to penetrate our security. Your wife. Hello, darling, how are you? You went away and you left me. - Oh, ho! - Well.. I did not know you were married. It's, uh, one of the benefits of secrecy. - I wasn't expecting you. - Oh, of course, you weren't. You never take me anywhere. How do you do? Dr. Kharmusi at your service. Oh, you must be his kind-hearted nurse. Yes, uh, Dr. Kharmusi is a very famous world scientist, my dear. I'm overwhelmed and delighted that you're here but he and I do have some business to discuss so I suggest you go back up to your room. 'If you will please excuse me, Mr. Solo' I have no doubt that you would much prefer the company of your most lovely wife for the moment. We can discuss business tomorrow at our leisure. I'd prefer not to wait. I insist. You would not think me a proper host otherwise. Goodnight. He knows something. We've got to get into that vault now. It will be extremely dangerous because they're sure to watch our every move on their monitors. We can't wait. Why don't you and I take a little stroll? Have a guided tour. We'll find out what they're up to soon enough. It may be a coordinated plan.. ...with other elements outside. Put all external security on condition red. This is the doctor's collection of original - Hmm. - From the Caspian Sea area. He is the most celebrated artist in all of Persia. We wait here for Napoleon's signal. End of the road. This is the vault room, Mr. Solo. No one may enter here. Only Dr. Kharmusi can open it. They're at the vault now, doctor. Perhaps you'd like to see the doctor's collection of poisoned mushrooms. Yes, I'd like to see that. I'd like to speak to Dr. Kharmusi at once. Oh, that was quick. I didn't know doctors still made house calls. I've been there some time...admiring. What may I do for you? Uh, well, oh, since everybody is making deals, um well, I'd like to make one with you. Um, an exchange of information actually. I would hesitate to deny you. Alright. I'm not Solo's wife, and he's a spy. Yes, I know. You do? Now what may I offer you? Luther Sebastian. Where is he? Sebastian? Not having met the gentleman, I'm sure I couldn't say. But I should imagine Mr. Solo would know. You answered my question but I didn't like the answer. - I'm sorry. - I'm not afraid to use this. Please, do. We detected that weapon the moment you entered the building. It has since been unloaded. Now shall we go and see what Mr. Solo can tell us? We didn't set off that alarm. Solo. Switch to ultimate V. - What are you doing? - Maneuvering, my dear. Uh, Mr. Solo, a few questions. And if you please, a few answers. The young lady here would like to find one Luther Sebastian. Who is he? When may I expect him? Difficult questions, doctor. Then you must consider the answers carefully, Mr. Solo. Turn on the sand. 'Let me know if anything comes to mind.' Water is a precious commodity in the desert so we converted this device to sand. They have monitors in all the hallways. Check all alarm circuits. Everything negative, sir. I should have known. Never to trust a woman who's always on time. It always indicates a much deeper problem. We have to find the right circuit 'to kill that whole monitor system.' Time is running out, Mr. Solo. Pardon me, sir. Our 10 o'clock security check revealed two of our men found unconscious at the perimeter of the estate. Why was this not reported to me earlier? We were investigating. We didn't wanna disturb you until, uh 'we found something conclusive.' Of course. Anyone can make a mistake. But not just anyone can work for me. Sir, the monitor system has gone out in section five. Switch off the warning alarm. Activate red light security. Wait here. Uh-uh. The walls are sensitized. So is the floor. 'You drop as much as a feather' 'you'll hear nothing but alarms.' What about the face of the safe? Same. 'There is only one way out, Mr. Solo.' I'll be back in a few minutes. Where do you think you're going? Napoleon may need some help. That's his problem. I'll be back in a few minutes. 'This is your final opportunity, Mr. Solo.' Monitor circuits in section five have been cut, sir. There's also a hole in the roof. Seal off all exits. I'm going to section five. - I don't think he's gonna talk. - I don't think either. Turn off the sand. Well, you're not gonna let him die! That is exactly what I'm going to do. That is why I am a successful scientist and he's going to be a dead spy. Well, then, why am I still alive? We'll discuss that later. Privately. Turn that off, or I'll turn you off. - The switch is right there. - Do it. Oh, no. Please take me with you. I'm a friend of Mr. Solo, uh.. Ah! I brought your friend. Swell. Where's Sebastian? You may come out from there. Violence is our department, remember? Well, look at the positive side. He'll, uh, never build another thermal prism. Are you dying? Are you? By special surgery, a tiny transmitter was implanted in his heart. When his heart stops, an auto-destruct mechanism is activated and the building will explode. He said to me many times "You can't take it with you." That's the beginning. The auto destruct. - How do we get out of here? - You can drive. Come on. 'Get the prism.' Very good, Carl. I think I have a number of questions to ask you. Hmm, just one really. What am I doing? And the answer, Mr. Solo, is that I'm keeping the thermal prism for myself. After all, I planned this entire expedition. 'I couldn't get in to the Kharmusi estate' 'with my personnel, so quite naturally' 'I agreed to let UNCLE do the job for me.' You'll get the general idea, I'm sure. Hmm. I'm afraid so. You seemed to have planned everything carefully including the right safe in the vault so that we'd be sure and recruit you. Actually, Azalea handled that for me. Oh, but credit where credit is due. We couldn't have done it without you. Put them on the boat, and tie them up. 'Your plan is somewhat incomplete, Sebastian.' The prism is only marginally effective unless it's in orbit. You'll have to do that for yourselves. I don't think we'll be interested in helping you there. Thank you. I've taken that into consideration. You remember these gentlemen, Mr. Solo. 'Disciples of the 3rd Way?' The white hair was my idea. A sign of fealty. Yes, um, Azalea is our high priestess. She should be. Assuming you get the prism into orbit, what then? The 3rd Way will demand a national homeland for its followers. We will control the balance of power in the world. You know what I think? I think you people are strange. 'Really strange.' I don't know who you are, but I have a feeling you probably deserve whatever happens to you. Your contact ship's out there. We'll deliver you to them. I wouldn't suppose this ship were rigged to blow up. Wouldn't you? I would. Come, Azalea. Full throttle ahead. - 'No reply, sir.' - Something must've gone wrong. 'She's on a collision course.' Shall I order the boat destroyed? Yes. Prepare torpedo launch. Fire one! Did you hear that? Sounds like they fired a torpedo at us. 'They did!' Over the side! Put a light over there. The rope, sir. We can use a rope! The water is s-s-somewhat c-c-cold. Alright. I assure you we have considerably warmer water for you if you don't have the prism. The research computers cannot confirm Sebastian's rocket capabilities. Not enough data. If Sebastian can find a way to launch that prism into space he'll be in a position of incredible power. We must use every precaution, gentlemen. Time is against us. The Aegean Island has been abandoned and the Athens office reports they've found no clues. Here's something though. Sebastian has a wife.. ...living in Los Angeles. Evidently separated. It's not much of a lead to be sure. - Better check it out, Mr. Solo. - Yes, sir. Uh, what about the girl that jeopardized your mission? 'Where is she now?' She's in debriefing, sir. I don't believe she'll cause us anymore trouble. What happened? We had just finished debriefing when she slipped out of the room. We found her in the equipment section pilfering. I'll take her to reception. I was just admiring your marvelous equipment. Why, if I had all this at my disposal I'd find Sebastian in no time at all. You're certainly not doing much to find him. My poor Hugh. Why, we've been engaged for eight months now and all this time, he's been rotting in a Turkish prison. And do you know why? Because your friend, Mr. Sebastian framed him. Well, don't you care? Don't you care at all? Sebastian was graduated from Harvard at the age of 18. 'We were married then in Des Moines.' But everyone resented Sebastian. They said he was too smart for his own good. So he went his own way. I haven't seen him in eight years. 'Now you know all there is to know.' So please leave from where you came. You often give these guided tours? CIA, the FBI, Scotland Yard, and the Better Business Bureau. Over the years, they've all been here at one time or another. I'm used to the traffic though I think, uh five o'clock in the morning is a little too much, don't you? I'm Napoleon S-O-L-O from the U-N-C-L-E. Mm-hmm. It's been, uh, some time since an UNCLE agent was here. I thought you had forgotten about us. No. We never forget. Oh, please do and leave me alone. A question, if you haven't seen him in the last eight years.. ...why do you stay here and keep up this charade as Mrs. Luther Sebastian? Oh, I have my pride, Mr. Solo. What if everyone in Des Moines found out that I was living here like this so...alone with nothing? Hmm. What would they do? Tell me. Oh, they'd talk. Mm. One last question. Uh, why should I believe you? Oh. Because I'm lonely. Well, I think I'll, uh, just take a look around if you don't mind. Oh. Help yourself. I'll, uh, slip into something more comfortable. Oh, it's, uh, on second thought I don't think I'll find what I'm looking for here. - Are you sure? - No. That's the chance I'll have to take though. Goodbye. What kept you so long? May I speak to Mr. Sebastian, please? This is Mrs. Sebastian. Yes, I'll wait, but please hurry. I'll need a computer possibilities breakdown on missile transports. Have it on my desk by morning. I'll try, sir, but that's a big job. I don't know if I'll have it by then. - You will. - Yes, sir. Make a note to have Carl sent on that volunteer assignment scheduled for tomorrow. - Yes, sir. - I like the way you said that. It has a nice tone of.. ...respect, efficiency. - Yes, sir. - Keep it up. Yes, sir. - Yes? - It's me. I miss you. Oh, it's you. Well, you know I can't live much longer without you. There was an UNCLE agent that just left here. - 'Napoleon Solo.' - What? He's...still alive, huh? Well, thank you for the call, dear, I'll, uh.. ...be sending you a little something extra this month. Luther? Where are you now? When are you coming home? We're not to talk of that, Laura. You know I have my work. Signal the men stationed outside my wife's house to pursue and destroy the spy that just left there. Yes, sir. I guess it's no secret. My wife doesn't understand me. Turn around. Slowly. '69-S, please. Assignment confirmation.' This is 69-S. Assignment completed. 'Your application for volunteer duty' 'has been approved, 69-S.' 'You're to proceed immediately to Sierra Canyon Highway.' 'Set your homing monitors on frequency D.' 'I repeat, proceed immediately.' I'll be there. - You're too late for breakfast. - I know. I ain't about to do any more cookin'. It's my misfortune. Mom, it's time. Will you turn on the set? Mom! Please. Turn on the set, Mom. Keep a lookout in the back, Mom. Keep 'em covered, Mom! 'Good afternoon, gentlemen.' Today, you embark upon a mission of paramount importance. Our future, the future of the world.. ...depends upon the outcome of your mission today. This afternoon, gentlemen, you will obtain for us a United States government rocket. This rocket is the final stage in our grand design. With it, we shall put the thermal prism into orbit. And the world will be at our feet. 'I'm making a special close circuit appearance' to our faithful members across the country today. They will gather in their meeting places anxiously awaiting the mission-accomplishedsignal from you men. Good luck. And...keep the faith. You four men will go with 18-B here and he'll fill you in on the way. The rest of you will be coming with me in the truck. Now you leave your car keys with Mom and she will dispose of the cars. - Where's the, uh... - That door. Excuse me. Open Channel D, please. - Kuryakin here. - Alright. I'm pressed for time, Illya. I'm on the inside. With any luck, I'll get to Sebastian's headquarters today. Now get this, Sebastian is using a close circuit system built by West-Industries. It may lead.. - Come on. Let's go. - Napolean? Napoleon? Thanks, Mom. If everything goes right, Mom I'm gonna be taking you away from this place pretty soon. I like it here. I know. I know. Creeps. Open Channel D, please. Don't get too close. He's very tricky. I've checked out Mr. Solo's lead. Security research informs me that an organization known as Three Way Incorporated recently purchased a close circuit television system from West-Industries. 'It was delivered to a local address' a vacant motion picture theatre. Checking further I discovered that the theatre was purchased only a few weeks ago by Three Way Incorporated. Well, I would suppose that the theatre is a meeting place for Sebastian's organization. - Best check it out. - I'm on my way there now, sir. Oh, I just hope he leads us to that awful woman that killed poor Hassan. Mmm. Did anyone ever mention that you look exactly like your brother? Uh. Uh. Alright, men. Come on out. There she is. The rocket's on that flatcar. Now we gotta select a drop man. Take out your ID cards. I'm gonna do this very democratically. The highest number which is issued to the newest member. Ah. 69-S. Looks like it's you. This explosive has a ten-second timing device. It's just about right to, uh, gobble a flatcar. Now you'll time it so that once you drop in a flatcar you can blow the coupling right away. And we'll take care of the rest. What about the guards? The other unit will take care of the ones on the outside. Uh, the car in front of the rocket is full of federal agents, but, uh we'll be in and out so fast, they won't know what hit 'em. Alright. I'll count on it. Good luck. Keep the faith. You did a...good job. But you'll have to ride in the back with the rest of the men. - Hmm? - I can't show any favoritism. Oh, yeah. I understand. Brothers and sisters.. ...the great throbbing heart of the 3rd Way embraces us. We who are dedicated to a new mystical insight 'transcending all others' 'till death do us part.' We have rejected society with all its false values. But never forgetting... that society rejected us first. 'Brothers and sisters..' ...you have found refuge.. ...when all about you were losing theirs. 'A place for all of you..' '...and all of you in his place.' The cry goes out to every nation. Send us your tired.. ...your automated, your exploited.. ...yearning to break free. 'We put you now to 3rd Way headquarters' 'for an urgent message.' Uh, good afternoon, my brothers and sisters. I have just received word from our special forces unit.. ...that they have successfully acquired the United States government rocket. 'The rocket is now on its way to headquarters.' 'This rocket is the, uh, final in a series of, uh' 'unofficial acquisitions we've made over the past months.' 'Uh, with it, we now have sufficient..' Open Channel D, please. '...to launch the thermal prism into orbit.' 'Within a matter of hours, we will control' 'the most powerful weapon in the world.' 'And now..' '...my followers..' '...it will be up to you in your individual chapters' 'to carry through on the local level.' 'Once the prism is in orbit, you will form into tactical units' 'as indicated in your manuals.' You will then perform communications control carry out all necessary assassinations and generally maintain order while the world is responding to our requests. 'Until then I remain..' ...your humble servant. Goodbye. And...keep the faith. This man is a trespasser. We forgive him... in our own way. I think that he and the young lady.. ...have just won a free trip.. ...to Los Angeles. Very good. Drive it to headquarters! Time is of the essence! This is an historic moment. What you men have done today will be long remembered by the peace-loving peoples of the world. 'You have proven yourselves worthy of the 3rd Way..' '...and the 3rd Way will show its gratitude.' I have a small surprise for you. Azalea! 'You all know our high priestess, Azalea.' - Keep them covered. - Hmm. A little something from the management. The jewel pin on Azalea. It's one of ours. I'll have Mr. Waverly put a tracking scanner on it. What does Sebastian have in mind for you? I don't know. Nothing good I'm sure. Another brother. You, uh, want me to go to headquarters with you? No, Carl. You deserve to stay here with your comrades. Enjoy. Hey. Whoo! - Hi there. - Hi. - Hi. - Listen, I have to make a call. - Oh, no! - No, I really do. No, don't. In case you're wondering why you're still alive.. ...you will have the great privilege of witnessing my people put the thermal prism into orbit. And use UNCLE as a mouthpiece to.. ...relay your demands to the world, I suppose. Exactly. I think your organization should be very helpful. It'd save me a lot of paperwork. - I found you again. - Uh-huh, so you did. Look what I brought you. Listen, I still have to make that phone call. Oh, you'll like me. I make friends easily. I-I-I'm sure. I'll be right back. Oh, no! I can't take another rejection, mister. Oh, now you'll have to stay and slip into something nice and warm. I understand your natural enthusiasm. Say, I thought there was something funny about you. Your hair dye.. ...isn't supposed to come off. Hey, he's a fake! Hey, everybody! He's a fake! What is that? Oh. It isn't mine. Of course not. It's a homing device. Which one of you did this? What difference does it make? None, really. What's the matter with him? Why doesn't he speak when I ask him a question? Well, when Omar was in the circus with his brothers well, he used to lie on the ground and life weights over his head. One of them dropped. Then put the pin on him. Put it on! What do you have in mind? Well, he won't make.. ...much of a career, will he? Happens all the time on the freeways. The, uh, party at the warehouse must be well underway. Oh...thank you. Thank you for reminding me. Loyalty is.. ...something that's difficult to measure. Don't tell me. You're another one of the Aksoy Brothers. I'm Kareem Aksoy. How did you know? Just lucky I guess. You're not tryin' to tell us that you're gonna launch a rocket from this building. It must be some kind of hoax. I can't believe you're really serious. He is serious. Yes, he is. Isn't he? My technicians formed an opening in the roof directly above the rocket. Now, this side of the building has been reinforced 'to serve as a silo.' I think the old man is about to speak. What's the matter with him? He hasn't uttered a word in 20 years. The belief is that when he speaks the 3rd Way will inherit the Earth. You probably believe that too. I am the high priestess. It's my job to believe it more than anyone. Well, uh.. ...I'm sure that, uh, once the thermal prism is launched tonight, the old man will speak. And appropriately so.. '...for then we'll be prepared' to fulfill his mystic destiny. Return to your stations. I don't want to be a killjoy, but isn't the control panel rather close to the base of the rocket? It could explode, you know. No danger, Mr. Kuryakin. The shield around the base is composed 'of a special heat resistant alloy.' One I created myself, as a matter of fact. My people will be.. ...well protected. Uh, put these two under guard in the observation booth. That's all of them, sir. Sign on the bottom, please. Thank you. How long have you been watching this warehouse? Day and night for six months. The one day I'm late returning from lunch, I miss Sebastian. Excuse me. Solo here. We've traced down their homing device Mr. Solo. It was found on the body of one Omar Aksoy. 'Nowhere near Sebastian' 'needless to say.' Do you have anything specific on Sebastian from any other sources? Nothing yet, Mr. Solo. No, not a thing. I'm sorry about your brother. I will repay Sebastian. One thousand fold. The computers are locked in, sir. All systems go. All units secure countdown positions. Confirm all tower tracking zones. Double lock all computers. Confirmed. Alright! Countdown set for zero hour minus fifteen minutes. 'When I left here last night, they almost killed me.' 'Now, you got them onto me.' You know how to get in touch with Sebastian. I want you to get in touch with him for me, now! - I can't. - Now! Oh, honest, I can't. I'm afraid you'll have to. Now, look, the world is running out of time and I'm running out of patience. Now, are you going to.. 'Report to headquarters, Mr. Solo.' 'Emergency, pattern 14.' I'm afraid you'll have to wait. I'm about... 'That's a direct order from Mr. Waverly.' Alright. I'll be back for you. 'H hour minus 11 minutes, 15 seconds.' Thanks. I knew you'd oblige. Hello. Hello? There's a malfunction in the nose cone interlock. Well, get someone tofix it! Emergency clearance. I want a circuit breakdown on a local area on FRL23-MP246. There is no need for those. These aren't for me. I was just thinkin' of my poor Hugh. At this very moment give or take a few hours time difference.. ...he's rotting in that awful Turkish jail. And if somethin' happens to me, he'll never get out. We've pinpointed the location, sir. 1-5-4-4-4 Wilshire Boulevard. Uh, backup units are on the way, Mr. Solo. That should be it. I want that nose cone repaired! Now! Too late, Mr. Solo. 'We began without you.' He's very annoying. Can you force the door open? They must be at the lowest level. The interlock.. ...is it fixed yet? Well.. Lock all computers, finalize all procedures! 'H hour minus five minutes.' Against the wall! The rocket is on auto control, Mr. Solo. You can't stop it now. You've done a good job, the best you could do, but it's all over. 'And even if you send me to jail, I'll get out.' And the thermal prism will be up there waiting for me. Maybe not. Solo! 'Ten, nine, eight' 'seven, six, five' 'four, three, two' 'one, zero, fire.' Alright, destroy all that equipment. 'He's dead.' I wonder what he would've said. Thank you. A visitor for you. Oh, thank you, Napoleon. Oh, thank you. My darlin' Hugh finally released from prison and you arranged everything! Oh, thank you! How do you do? I'm Ali Aksoy. Where is Hugh? - Where is he? - You must be Annie. Well, where is Hugh? Uh, dear, he isn't coming. Well, it seems his mother was notified of his release and she was waiting at the prison gate. Well, even though he was jailed unjustly well, as was I well, the family kept the entire affair a secret, you know? Uh, but...but he, uh, he did ask me to give you this. Oh. At least he sent the ring back. What are you going to do now? Find somebody that fits this. Well.. ...thank you, Mr. Solo, anyway. Uh, I'm indebted to you, sir, for my release. Thank you. Dear, lady, I'm at your service. May I be of assistance? 'Never can tell.' The ring might just fit him. Well.. ...we'll just have to find out, won't we? - Anything new? - Not much. Revolution in the Orient a multi-million dollar train robbery in England five kidnapped scientists and a plan to melt the polar ice cap. Good, I think I'll take the afternoon off.
