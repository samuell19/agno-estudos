A cable was cut, we repair it. Move along. Whore. Where am I going? We will not catch them. Is the gendarmerie called? Do something, I beg you. I do not want to scare you, but newspapers on the bed could mean that it is kidnappers of this girl. Why did they kidnap him? For money. What did they do to him? It may not be the same. In fact, they had threatened ... to kill the little if the police were warned. This is for a that you have to be very careful. They killed him? They killed him? You will stay planted there do nothing? Who saw it last? We must ask Felipe. He knows nothing. Except she was tired and that she went up to bed. In fact, she was fine, she had a drink and all of a sudden ... We would have put something in his glass? What? Somnif re ... They probably had an accomplice the party. The current was cut when she was upstairs. We must call the gendarmerie. Please. No way. I do not want to hurt him. Rflchissons. What else can be done? Who has the video of the party? - Who kept it? - The video? The young people of the center. Who had the idea to invite offenders? Bea knows them. Call them right away. - 4:30 in the morning? - It does not matter. Bea had told you that they would come to film? She proposed, I accepted. Why them? They would not do that. Paco. What happened? We know nothing. Felipe ... Did she tell you anything special? Like what? What she wanted us to do a joke? No. You did not see anyone suspicious? Not at all. And the pickers? Just something ... We fell on the motorcycle, on the road. We could not start again. The pickers arrived and helped us. When was it? Yesterday. Anyway ... it was not improvised. They knew that Laura and her children were coming and they prepared everything. Newspaper articles ... the power failure. Here, no one has seen them. It's professionals. Someone went up put the newspapers on the bed. A stranger must have entered here. Not necessarily a stranger. You have to rest, Laura. Leave it alone. Did you know this story? It's been years. It was in the corner? Not far away. Rest. Let the parents decide if they go to the police. I am very scared for the little girl. Less than his mother, anyway. I should not help them?

I am here. All? Why do you say nothing? Irene ... Something happened to him last night. What happened to him? My God, what's going on? Where are you? Do not Cry. Tell me where you are. There was plenty of kids at the wedding, why did they take my daughter? It was the only one whose father could pay a ranon. Where they come from this stupid idea? Why stupid? Because it's wrong. You always say that you are doing well. Given what he has paid for the work of the church, it's normal that people think a. He has been unemployed for two years. Mum... What's the matter? Why are you crying? It's nothing, my dear. Where is Irene? Come on, we're going to breakfast. He wants to talk to you. Why did not you tell me before? I could not believe it. Even now ... She has her medication? Come quickly, please. Come. What? Do you know them well, these guys? Of course. Why? - What is happening? - Look. Whore. When did it happen? - When did it happen? - Two minutes ago. 300,000 euros ... Young people, do they have your number? Everyone has it, in the center. If it was them, they would not have written to me. - Why are you writing? - I do not know. You get too involved in everything a. What? You are too involved ... That's not the problem. The problem is that I get it, In the place of the mother. The problem, it's because you brought these guys. That's the problem? If you are so sure, call the cops. Did they give you the video? Yes. Laura, how's that? costs ... We received a message ... Two minutes ago. Oh? What did he say? Bea received the same. Send it to me. Okay. I'm coming very soon. She received the same? Yes. Forty years that you enjoy! Strips of cons! Go fuck yourself. Above all, you are starving! Call the police station. Shut up, stupid. CRVE-and-out! You owe me all the money! Dgage! These lands are me! All these lands are mine! Should not play your lands in poker! Drunkard! Be careful what you do! What's the matter with you? Crêve-la-faim band. We come back. Strip of thieves! Dgage! Licks me! We come back. Calm. You will make me all my lands. What fly stung him? I thought he was calm. Why does he fall back on us? He claims his lands thirty years later! Why do you let him drink? Whether he drinks or not, he is the same. One day, it's the cops who will settle a. He says those bullshit since always, me, the first. You are all disturbed, why? For nothing. He drank. That's all there is. Nothing else. You, I hold you back. You have to drink to the point of shame? Do you care about our reputation? Not me. They owe me everything. Where would they be without me? Why are you going out now? Because we need money to save the little one. Ah yes? It's you who have all dilapidated! It's enough! It's not the moment. For the sake of Irene, we must avoid these scandals. Are you going to dictate my conduct? Its good. Do not forget where you come from. You're not at home. You are walking here, as if you were family. Dtrompe up, your parents were my servants. Antonio, that's enough! Let me talk. If you do not like it, shut your ears. You owe me even more than all the others. You boast of your domain: "My field"... You owe it to me, your domain. You forced Laura ... Let me talk. You forced my daughter To give you these lands. Paco! I forced you to sell your land? - What? - I forced you to sell? Why are you talking about a? I bought them to help him. Ah yes? Yes. At the price that suited you. I was not bern'e. Alejandro and me We needed money. Paco did not have enough. I told him to give me what he had. Including? Do not take it badly. You know him. Give a Laura. That she calls me. I take you first to see someone. Who? I'll tell you. Can I keep the video? No problem, I think. No. Show the messages. Can we locate them? In general, it's easy. But they know how to hide. They buy multiple SIM cards with fake papers. They send SMS since old t l phones that they destroy, with the map, after each shipment. But you still have to show them to the police. We have not decided yet if we would prevent it. As soon as the gendarmerie will be informed of the disappearance, she will intervene. What should we do? We must believe What you are looking for to collect money. How? By soliciting your entourage. Who could go out such a sum? We need to know What you are looking for. It will save you time. How will they know? They are watching you, one way or another, it's safe. Do not talk about this meeting. Not even to the father? Can I see you alone? Yes. Fernando ... he is reliable, what type? Yes. Why? He will not talk? No, he retired. I made him swear. They sent the second message also Bea. Bea? Paco's wife. Since when do you know Paco? We grew up in the same house. Before I go, we were together. Together? Yes, together. Lover... And now? Everyone lives his life. It's over. On good terms? What can I do? I try to understand why his wife had the SMS. Sorry... Dad, I'm going there. Okay. Pay attention to yourself. You too. I'll miss you. You too. - Call me when you arrive. - Okay. Do you always come without him? No. He could not come this time. If I have something, I call Fernando. Thank you very much, Jorge. Rest, I want to watch the video together. I'll bring you back. Andrs! There is someone? Andrs! Come, I'm in a hurry. You'll stay a little, after all this time. - We'll taste it. - No. Do not you want to taste your wine? What's the matter? It does not seem to go. I have a service to ask you. I ask you, before refusing, to think about it. I always think before talking. I need money urgently. For the vineyard? No, it's personal. Can you help me? I thought. It's no. Okay. I am ready to sell you my share. Why, all of a sudden? costs ... This association, between us, can not last. We must find a good pear who buys it all. Yes, but I need liquid, right now. So, I sell you my part low price. You did not even let buyers visit the domain. Eh yes. Something happened? Reflected on my proposal and answer me as soon as possible. - I have to go. - Where are you going? Take a seat. What is this money for? Decides yourself. It's urgent. Heard. I'm going to think. What's the matter? What's wrong? What's this? When did you get it? At the moment. She does not have her medication on her. Yes? I'm with Laura. You just received it? Read it to me. Hold on. Read it. "Your daughter is bad. She can not breathe anymore. "Find the money before she dies. " She received the same. I'll call you back. I can not breathe. - Is it okay? - No. Breathe. Voil. Do you want to go down? J'touffe. I told him: "And my mother?" She said: "Prepare your bag softly "and pull yourself." That may be what she did. Why would she do that? I dunno. Good evening. Goodbye. Whore... Do you have something new? We combed the videos, nothing. My friend says something which makes sense to me. What if we had not kidnapped him? They had to come together, right? Why Alejandro suddenly changed your mind? Laura said it was for work. He's been working for two years. - What? - He would have gone bankrupt. Two years. Whore... Do not give up, Fernando. How he would have climbed from Argentina? If the kid is wicked ... He can send SMS from there. If that was the case, Laura would have suspected it the first. Laura, to doubt her husband? I dunno... You do not think it's weird that they write to your wife? It's weird. I am very scared. If something happens to him ... Fernando is right. We must call the gendarmerie. If we do not do it, what other choice do we have? I would call the gendarmerie. And the time they act, how the little girl is going to survive without his medication? Do not worry. God will help us. Why did he make us? Stop these nonsense. You have to find the money. How? They will steal it? We have to wait. Paco may be able to help us for money. A similar sum? He spoke to his partner to sell him his share. Why would he do that? He does not really do it. He pretends to make the noise run. This is his idea? We went to see a friend of Fernando, a cop at retirement, to have his opinion. He said we had to pretend to collect money. And after? After ... In two days or a week, when they will know that we do not have the money? I dunno. I do not know. I can not think anymore. Sorry to bring you here. My friend prefers ... Be careful. - Where is he? - In the car. He's waiting for you. His name is Jorge. Laura ... he wants to see him alone. He's holding up. He lets nothing appear. He is suffering inwardly. You have full confidence in your husband? What is that question? He loves his children. We run a risk if we warn the police? Even if the risk is minimal, you have to stay very discreet. They can investigate in secret, without it being known? Why you did not accompany your family? I had job interviews. It went well? Are you interested? Everything interests me to save your daughter. - Did you find work? - No. Why? Why... Ask him who did not take me. Because of alcohol? Who told you that? It's been sixteen I did not drink a drop. According to your wife, you are ruined. So what? The police will tell you that this act was not committed by strangers. Of course. Since it's me. It's his father. Come on, let's go. Who is it? It's you? You told all this con? Tell what? Alcohol, unemployment, Bankruptcy, everything! It's not the moment, Alejandro. It's my daughter! Let me decide what to do. Tits of fuck! Tits of fuck! I spoke to him. I thought that might help. That would have helped her to know I'm unemployed and that I am ruined? - What are you talking about? - Answers! Why would I suspect you? - Did I say that? - You insinuate it. Why would I suspect you? - Your whole family suspects me. - What? Did not you see their eyes this morning? And these two! They are all worried about your daughter and you, you speak only of God. It is normal that they suspect you! Sleep a little. How to sleep without knowing where my daughter is nor what can we do to him? I hate myself to do nothing. We must prevent the police. My love... We can help him. If you agree. Paco could give us the money. You said he was pretending. He could do it. Why would he do that? Let me try. Let me talk to him. To tell him what? I'm ready for anything to find it. No. Think Irene. We will lose our daughter. He will not give it to you. Maybe so. If he refuses, we will go to the gendarmerie. He will not give you the money. You'll tell him and you will not get anything. Please. Please. Please. I asked To hear the voice of my daughter. They passed it to me. She said that she was not well. Shortly after, they strangled her and thrown into a well. When the body has been found, I could not recognize my daughter. I said it was not her. Paco ... What are you doing here? You're alone? Yes. He answered you? Who? Your partner. No, no answer. But the noise ran, that's good. Yes, but... you would be ready to sell really? The domain? Yes. If everything happened to your child, you would do nothing, either? I do not know what to say. This area has employees. Families depend on it. I know but... You still have not forgiven me. What? To have left you. You never let me explain. I do not want to talk about a. Not here. Neither here nor anywhere. I do not want to talk about it. You remember my first return after getting married in Argentina? We had not seen each other for three years. I came alone. You were not with Bea yet. Do you remember? Yes I remember. From the last night too? Yes too. You took me to the airport. We talked during the whole trip. All of a sudden, you stopped. You started crying in my arms. You could not accept for having lost me. We went down. You came near me. You kissed me ... If you seek revenge on me, do not hurt the girl. It's your daughter. How? No, do not make me. It's your daughter. Is it okay? Yes. What did she want, Laura? Help. You help them already. Money. - Why you? - I dunno. She thinks maybe that she sold me the lands too cheap. After all this time? Is it okay? Come sit down. Do you eat with us? We had lunch. - We come to the news. - There is nothing, we wait. Paco and I are very touched by what you live. We would like to help you by all means. But in fact, we have the impression to be considered as indebted. As if it was our duty to help you. It's not the moment. Everyone is there ... I want things be clear. Which things? What Bea means ... Let her talk. You have some suggestions on these lands. Who, "you"? You all. We do not have any intentions. But we do not forget how Paco bought them. It was worthless land. This is ... Yes. Paco and me, we've had seven years, to get something out of it. - These lands are mine. - They are who works them. You will share them with the pickers? - We did not come for a. - Me, yes. I hope that Irene ... will come back soon and we will will end with these discussions. It's not because we say nothing that everything's OK. I sold them at a low price to help a friend. But you needed money? It's enough. Sorry. I need it somebody's money. Thank you. My daughter will come back. God will help us. Excuse me. - What did you tell him? - All. We had sworn. Desolate, it's for the little girl. It is precisely for her that we should not say anything. What did you do? It's for our daughter. You thought about his life? What's the matter? You did not have that before. Viewing. Have you seen what state you put yourself in? I will sell my share to Andr s. It was not a stratagem? I am terrorized for the little girl. Pay these people, it's encouraging them to continue. You would not say that if it was our daughter. Yes. If you were a mother, you would be less sure of yourself. Luckily, I never wanted to be a mother. It's my daughter. What did you say? It's my daughter. What are you saying? Have you gone mad? Do not touch me! - We'll talk. - I do not want. Sit down, let's talk. I do not want. listen to me. - I thought we were hiding nothing. - I did not hide anything. Go away, I want to be alone. Laura told me yesterday. She tells you she's your daughter and you believe it? We slept together one last time ... And she fell pregnant! Do not you see they want money? It started with the domain you would not have paid enough. It did not work, so they take out that lie. - Why a lie? - And why not? They want no money. Did not you hear it? What do you want him to say? He saves appearances. And his wife comes to tell you that she is your daughter. Why this marriage in the village, you think? No one is getting married the countryside. They are all wicked! You slept with her one last time? And if the next day, she slept with her husband? How do you know it's your daughter? Why is she telling you now? How can you be so naive? Laura is here? She's up there with Roc o, Why? My little... The poor, where is she? Hello. Can you leave us alone? You lied to him? What subject? What you said Paco ... I did not think he would tell you. If you try to extract money from him with this lie, I'll have to tell your husband everything. It's not a lie. My husband knows. What is happening? Guys have heard in the village that you are going to sell the estate. Who will pay us? Do not listen to this bullshit. I will pay you. Take the job again. Laura? Laura is here? She must be at the top, why? Someone wants to see her. Who? A friend of mine. Tell him to come down. Laura! New? Something is happening? It looks like you sold the domain? Yes. It was closed. They did it for you to believe that she was in and that you realize later of the abduction. - This is your son? - Yes. He slept in the same room that night? It's strange that they did not take him away. It would have been less risky. A little sleeping is easier bring a teenager. So, they had a reason to aim for it. Which? Fernando told me things about your daughter. Which things? Someone knew that it was not your daughter? Bea spoke to Fernando. I do not know. They are not professionals. But relatives who hold this information. Nobody knew it until then. I'm not saying they did it because she's Paco's daughter, for his money. But they wanted multiply their chances to be paid. In other words, if you could not pay, Paco would help you. When we decided to keep it, we promised ourselves to not tell anyone. Be attentive to your surroundings. Try to find who knows. Take a seat. Is it true that he sold? Why? I dunno. People say what? What? Of the madness he commits. People are talking. Since they have nothing to do in the village, they speak. What do they say? Do not do this only for his child. And before? Fernando, please. At the beginning, there were suspicions. About my daughter? What suspects? Paco and Laura were together long time. They say your daughter does things that make think Paco, small. One says? Who says it? - The family. - But who? Some... So, they know it. No one talked about it. But now that Paco sold his estate ... Now... Everyone knows it. You still love her? It's for the little girl. It's not true. What if they did it themselves? I know what I'm doing. You do not know. - Who is this girl? - The girlfriend of my son. They were there for one night. Alejandro ... I'm sure we'll find her. Whoever did a can not be far. I have money, I received it today. All the money. Why are you doing this? Why am I doing this? If I did not do it and something happened Irene, I will never forgive myself. Why do not you forgive yourself? You have no obligation towards her. How? No obligation, you say? No, but it's my right. - Ah yes? - Yes. Sixteen years have passed. Sixteen years. And you tell me when you need me? Paco, I have to tell you something. The birth of Irene saved my life. J'tais ... lost, drowned, destroyed by alcohol. I did not even go back At home. A night of desperation, I asked God: "Kill me or save me, my God." That night, I came back and Laura told me that she was pregnant with you. I thought that was the end, that I had lost it, for good, really. But the opposite happened. God gave me a big shot to make me react. - God? - Yes. Laura wanted to abort. I did not know. I convinced her to keep it. God gave me this shot to get me out of the shit. God? My God. It's him who got me out of hell. I'm sure that he will save her too. Your God will save Irene? Maybe he uses me to save Irene. You saved it once, this time it's me. I risk my daughter's life for your pride of shit. What pride? I have no more pride! You do not have any more pride?
