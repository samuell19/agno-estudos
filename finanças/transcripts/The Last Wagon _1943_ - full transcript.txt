THE LAST WAGON Let me take care of that for you, Captain. Kid, don't move! Captain! Captain! I'm here! I'm here. - You're the most handsome officer in the Air Force. - Thanks. And you're the most important coachman in all of Rome. I want to shout it from the rooftops: "See this kid here? He's my son!" Dad, you're a good man. If you fly over Rome, come lower and drop us a rope... ... that way Bianchina and I can climb up and see you. - Write, won't you? Always write. - Of course, don't worry. Can you imagine what your mother and Nannarella would be like if they were here? No, this is the proper way to say goodbye: As men, smiling... - Bye. - Bye, Dad. We'll see each other soon Dad, don't worry. Bye, Dad. Give a kiss to Mum for me. And one for Nannarella, too. Bye, Dad! - Do you smoke? - Yes. - Here you go. Thanks... - What's going on? - I told you we'd run out eventually. - Did you think I was lying? - You can't just leave me here! Well?! Well, nothing. Now I have to get them to come an pick me up. - So you won't take me to the station? - How can I? We're out of petrol. You'll ruin me, I'll have you know. Do something! Don't just stand there, find me a taxi! There's one! Call him! - He was free. - No, he was occupied. - What will I do now? It's my debut tonight. - If I'm not there, the show's over. - It's not like I can make petrol out of thin air. - I'll pay you more if you get me to the station. - It's not a question of money, I can't! - Take a carriage. - We'll get there tomorrow. - No you won't, it's not far from here. - Hey, Coachman! - Sorry, my shift's over. - To the station, quickly! - Sorry Miss, the horse is very tired. - You're worse than he is. - What? - Come on, take her to the station. - Just a moment, Miss. He'll take you. - Why can't you take her? - Because I'm out of petrol. - Well I'm out of horse. - Do you want money? - I'll give you a 5 lire tip if you take me. - It's not a question of money, I just can't. - What kind of people are you? - Come on, it's her debut at Civitavecchia tonight! - Don't worry, Miss. He'll take you. - Stop it, take your cases. - Hey! Those cases are mine, you can't throw them around like that! - Idiot! - Who do you think you are? - Do you want a whip in the face?! Then step down here! I'll take care of you and your horse! I'll take care of both of you! Come on, get me to the station! - No! - When you're not on duty, you have to put your flag up! - I'll do whatever I want! - Then I'll call a policeman! Just a moment... - I don't know when we'll get there. - Tomorrow, at this rate! Get that donkey moving! - I'll give you a donkey! - And hurry up about it. - Quickly, please. - It's not up to me. Delinquents... - Can't you make the horse walk faster? - Miss, we're going uphill. - My God, we're slowing down. - Can't you see the red light? - What are you doing? Why have we stopped? - There's a red light! What does that matter? Just go on through it, we're in a hurry. - I don't want to risk getting a fine. - You'll make me lose my train, hurry up! - You shouldn't get so angry, Miss. - First the hill, then the red light. You'll make me miss my train! - Hurry up! Make it hurry up! - I can't, we're going against the grain. What are you saying? I don't understand? I said that we're going against the grain. - You people are terrible! - There's no need to insult me. - Give it a few whips, go on. - I can't whip her, Miss. I keep the whip as an ornament, I never use it. - Then do it for me! - I'm sorry, I don't whip ladies either. Oh, you're all the same! I can't believe we made it with this horse! Porter! Quickly, on the train for Civitavecchia. First class. How much do I owe you? How much?! - It's written there. - It's 4 lire, 4 times 2 makes 8. You're an idiot, I won't give you a tip! - What do I care?! - Porter, quickly! - Are you free? - No, I'm out of here. I'm leaving, if she misses that train, I'll have to take her all the way to Civitavecchia! Excuse me! This guy must be deaf! Excuse me, thank you. Excuse me! Sorry, the train's leaving! Please excuse me! Porter, the cases! Quickly, the train's leaving! Please excuse me. Put that one up for me, thank you. Thank you. There's another one, isn't there? Thank you very much. Is that all of them? 1, 2,3,4, there's one missing! Porter! Porter, wait! - There's one missing. My jewelry case. - Miss, you stepped on my foot! What do I care about your foot? Stop! Stop! I've lost all my jewels! I'm ruined, don't you see?! Don't look at me like that, do something! I've lost all my jewels! - Not all of them, Miss. You still have your most precious jewels. - What? - Your eyes. - The people you find on trains! - Quirino, bring a glass over here. - To good health! Down with those taxi drivers! - They should put them all behind bars. - That'll do, thanks. What do you mean? This is for my friend, she's waiting outside! - A pair of drivers to each cell. - And whipped until they can't take it anymore! I'm not against drivers who were born drivers. Why should I be? This is progress, isn't it? Life is fast-paced, you know, that's how it is. That guy's born a coachman, that other one's born a salesman... ... everyone has their own trade. What I won't tolerate is coachmen that become drivers... ... like that Pasquale, who then tried to convince everyone else to do the same. You have to own the car, and 1 taxi license costs the same as 3 coach licenses... ... which means sacrificing 3 coachmen, I would have been out of work for a year. - If I hadn't found this horse. - Now we have the upper hand. - Of course, we're the masters of Rome. - Thank you! - For what? - For the wine. Goodbye! - What have you done? - I took the wine out to your friend, there. - My friend? - Yes, the woman. - That ugly witch is no friend of mine! Give me that glass! If you want something done... - Pay the bill, will you. My friend! - I knew it. How much? - 7 lire. He didn't realise that I meant you, the best friend a man could have. How many years have we been working together? We've always been side by side. And that guy gives your wine to some ugly old witch! These people don't understand anything. Easy now, every drop spilled is a penny lost. Even she doesn't like this wine. Here, take it away. If I don't give her a glass every night she gets offended. What can I do? Now we're going home, alright? Every time I say that, her ears prick up. She knows how to get back home from anywhere in Rome. - You're tired, I know. We're not young anymore. - You're not that old! Old enough. Remember when everyone used to look at us? Now they look at us, but in a different way. My friend! The cover's up, see? That means I'm off duty. What's this suitcase? Ah, this belongs to that crazy woman I took to the station. There's no address on it, what am I supposed to do? - I guess I should take it to the police station. - Don't worry, I didn't see anything. Even if you did, it's the same thing. It's not like I can take it. Won't open... I'll have to drop it off at the police station on the way home... ... otherwise I'll be in trouble. - Bye, then. - See you later. There we go! Mrs. Adelina. Mrs. Adelina! Will Toto be much longer? I want him to see it right away. - I've fixed it up good as new. - I hope it won't electrocute us. - Don't you trust old Andrea? - My alarm clock is still broken, you know! - I told you, that was just an experiment! - Was the faucet an experiment, too? - You too, Nannarella? - I'm just kidding! Hold on, I've got something for you. That's right, an electrician would have asked for 30 lire to do what I just did. Is this spaghetti all for Toto? Not too much! Okay, a little more! If you keep drinking as much as you do, one of these days... Your husband's right when he calls you "The Queen of Nagging". - It's just a drop of wine. - Someone might require your services. - I see. - I'm going, then. - So will my shoes be ready by tomorrow? - Of course. - Cheers! - That's the door, over there. - Dad! - It's him. - No, it's nothing. - Toto! - Dad! - Toto, what happened to you? - Toto, are you hurt? - It's nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? - Where's his bed? - Through there. - Toto! - Take it easy! Easy! - My leg! - My poor Toto! - That rascal almost killed me! - It's nothing, just a little shock. - My poor Toto! - What happened? What happened? - The car hit the horse. - Dad! Dad! - Quick, get some water! - Put this under his head! - Take it easy! Toto! Toto! - Do you recognise me? - Andrea? Is that Andrea? He doesn't recognise you! Toto! - Do you recognise me? Who am I? - My wife... - Dad, how are you feeling? - Wonderful! - I knew something like this would happen. - Call the doctor. - No! - He didn't want to go to the hospital, Miss. - Then go and get Mr. Paolo. - I can take you, Miss, I have the car. - No! - Now he wants to help! - Toto! - I'm fine. - He's delirious. - Stop showering me! Nothing, just a scratch here and a bump there... - But the insurance will give me a million. - You'll kill me one of these days! - Are you sure you're okay? Let me see. - Don't poke me! - One of your ribs is broken! - I wish! That would make me 3,000 lire! - And this bump? - Another 500 lire. - Why do you have to make me suffer?! - I told you, it's nothing! - I don't believe you! Alright, then I've broken my leg, my shoulder, my head, everything! - Ah, I get it! And I'm right behind you. - I don't know... - What are you trying to do? - It's easy, he's just feigning. - You're feigning? - Of course, someone needs to teach these guys a lesson. - You know who that kid is? Pasquale's son. - Mr. Pasquale? If you only saw the bump he gave that poor animal! They can give us a million. They'll give us a million! You're right to feign injury, Toto. These folk must be made to pay. But you'll just get yourself into trouble. What will you tell the doctor? - That my head hurts. - Who knows what he's feeling? It's not like they can open it up! Help me get undressed. - Quickly, Doctor! - Miss, the syrup is on the shelf. Tell Lucchini that the papers will be ready by tomorrow morning. Don't worry Miss, it's really nothing. He only fell off the carriage. Thank you, you've been very kind. Where were you? Did you see him fall? - It was me who hit him. - You? - I wanted to tell you right away, but... - Slow down, please! I was having such a good day today... - Then some crazy woman ruined it for me. - This is the best kind of medicine. - Eat up, Toto. - Is it hot? Keep an eye on the window, will you? Remember, I'm half dead! - Here's the doctor, Dad. - How are we feeling? Don't worry Toto, the doctor will take care of you. - We've sent for some oxygen. - I said I don't want it, I don't like it! - Oxygen is good for you, isn't it Doctor? - Well yes, we'll see... - Are you hurt? - Yes, it's my head. - Dad! - Just a moment, now. - Can you sit up by yourself? - I don't think so. - This man is the father of a family! - Where are you hurt, here? - No, Doctor, he's not hurt. It's internal... - Inside! - I see, he fell... - And in falling down, he hit his head. - Hard. - When did you hit your head? Listen to this delinquent! It was a terrible blow, Doctor. Aren't you ashamed? We're suffering and he's laughing? - It doesn't seem like you're suffering. - I have to look after him, you know... - It's a strain to eat, but I have to... - Don't strain yourself, please! - But I have to! - No, it's not good to strain yourself. Isn't that right, Doctor? When you eat fast, you don't digest. Here you go, Adelina. - So your head hurts? - Very much. - And what else? - Nothing, it's all inside. What do you see? - A merry-go-round. - How many fingers? - Hundreds... - A million! That's what you and that father of yours will pay! Did you hear that? - Calm down. - Is everything misty? - Yes. - Things are blurry. - Yes, that's what I told him. Hold out your hand. No, like this. Still. - There's no trembling, so we can exclude trauma. There's no trauma. - There isn't? Did you hear that? He has no trauma left. - Poor thing, he was a man full of trauma! - What are you saying? Trauma means shock! - Of course, Doctor... - There's no need for alarm. I'll drop by tomorrow, we'll have to wait before deciding. Soak his head in warm water, and if the pain persists, give him this. - Tell me, Doctor, is it serious? - No. - Congratulations for now, I'll be back tomorrow. - Don't bother, you only annoy me. I know the name of the insurance company, now get out of here. Don't worry, and good evening. Did you hear? It's nothing. - Good evening, and don't forget to soak his head in warm water. - Good evening. Smell that! You were amazing. Come here, you! Don't look at me like that. I'm a good actor, aren't I? - We'll get our million. - Nannarella will get a new dress. - Twenty! - So your head doesn't hurt? - Even the doctor thought so! - The trauma! - The shock! - What do you see? - I see a merry-go-round! He said to soak it in warm water! I really will have to soak it in warm water. Nannarella, bring me the sugar. "Woman assaulted in a supermarket..." "Boy bitten by dog in Via Frattina..." "Wounded by an exploding rifle cartridge..." - Dad, I'm going. Bye. - Bye, and be good. Don't speak to anyone on the street. - When we get the money, you won't have to work anymore. - Bye. - Did you stir it? - Yes. They're talking about all these stupid things and there's nothing about me. I stopped traffic... ... almost fell to my death. - How would they know about it? That's why I called Mr. Paolo. If they talk about it in the newspapers, there's more chance we'll get our insurance. Anyway, I'm not moving from here. My head hurts, remember! Always cold. It should be in here. - What do you want for lunch today? - Quiet a moment... "The coachman that yesterday took..." - Oh my, the suitcase! - What suitcase? - Damn it, the suitcase! - Toto! - Thank God I had that accident. - I'd have given them the suitcase and missed out on the reward! - What are you saying? What am I saying? Listen to this. "To the coachman who, yesterday at 17:30..." "... took a young lady to the station..." "... please, return the suitcase left behind to number 50, Via del Babuino..." "... and accept a reward of 500 lire." It must be still in the carriage. Get me my trousers. - Paradiso! - Toto, good morning - Tell me... - How are you feeling? - Did you find anything in the carriage? - Yes, a little suitcase. No, I put it inside. - Where is it? - Here, here it is. - Did you open it? - No, it's not mine. - How's the horse? - Excellent, I put a... What are you doing, he looks like an easter egg with this bow. - I didn't know whether... - How did she sleep? - Very well. Then I made her a big meal of beans, and bran... - He doesn't have a temperature, then? - No. He's all trauma down here, but we can exclude shock. Listen, did you notice whether... ... he had any mistiness in the eyes? - Mistiness? - Not like that. Shall we go for a walk, Bianchina? A nice walk in the sun will do you good. Go on, fit her to the carriage, quickly. - Goodbye, Paradiso! - Goodbye, Sir! - Good morning. - Good morning, may I help you? - I'm the coachman with the case. - I don't understand. Who are you looking for? - Sorry, do you run this place? - No, I'm an artist. - A pleasure. Is there someone.... - Ah, I see. What are you selling? Eggs, flour... No, it's nothing like that. I read this advertisement in the newspaper. "Station... young lady..." 500 lire? - Is this the suitcase? - And I'm the coachman. - Ah, now I see. Everything is crystal clear. - I'll call the lady for you, just a moment. - Thank you. - Ah, well done. I placed the ad myself. Is this the suitcase, did you open it? - No... - There's a diamond inside. - A diamond? Wow, who lost it? - It was Mary. She called me from Civitavecchia last night. She was so worried, asked me to place the ad. Ah, women. Always losing things! I don't lose anything but time. - Why didn't you take it to the police station? - Ah, I had an accident on the way there. - Very well. Now we have to open it, but how? - May I? - I can open it. - Mary wouldn't want you to damage it. Leave it to me, I've had many suitcases like this. - May I? - Please, come in. Here are my keys, all we have to do is pick the right one. This one doesn't work, but this one does. There we go. "To my little kitten! Love, your Cicci." - Want to see her Cicci? - Cute. - Keep your nose out! Ah, here it is. It's beautiful, isn't it? Very pretty! - I'll go and get the 500 lire, wait here. - I'm not going anywhere. Mary said to write down your name and address as well. A nice bit of early morning profit! She's nice, that Mary, isn't she? - Actually, we did nothing but argue. - I can't stand her either. - You'll be visiting the symposium today, then? - I don't understand. Well, they say that Roman coachmen are rather fond of their wine. - Well, I like a drop. - A drop and more. Here comes your cash. - Here you go, did you write it down? - Yes. - You can afford a few bottles with that! - Thanks a million. - A million? Don't you mean thanks a 500? - Get it? - Goodbye, Sir. - Goodbye. Just a moment! Allow me to introduce myself: Valentino Doriani, comic. - A pleasure. - I'm honoured to shake the hand of a true gentleman. - You could have left the 500 and kept the diamond. - Well, I didn't know... Ah, no, I know men and male psychology. I admire you. In fact, I'd like to give you one of my photos. Would you like that? - Well... - Come. That was Valentino Doriani a year ago, I was much fatter. This was taken when I debuted at the Verdi in Bologna. What a crowd! Look at that expression! And a different expression there. That there's an old doll of mine. She still writes to me, but what we had is gone, over, finished... Which one do you want? Choose. This one? You have a good eye, Sir. Here I'm smiling, but I'm torn up inside. I have many faces, you see. Watch... Very good. See how the ears move. - What a performance! - You think so? - Reminds me of a donkey. Try it yourself. I'll write you a dedication. Where did I put my pen? - "Coachman" or "couchman"? - Coachman. Ah yes, coachman, derived from "coach". There we go! "To the most honest coachman in Rome. Valentino Doriani." - Thank you. - I'm a great artist, you know. But in Rome not enough people know me and even less want to pay me... ... but if they don't pay me, I can't make them laugh, right? - Well... Just a moment. - May I? Please, take your coat off. - Why? - Take it off, I say. - Excuse me. - I wouldn't dream of it. - This is your lucky day. - I don't understand. - Trousers. - What? - Take off your trousers. - Why? Here you go! Alduccio of Milan, 24,000 lire! It's a bit big for me, I'm afraid. - See how light and soft it is? - Are you looking for money? - You're an honest and intelligent. - Sorry, I can't... - Feel that material! - I know, but... - Try it on, it looks like a perfect fit. Look at those shoulders, and the sleeves fit perfectly! You're not a coachman anymore, you're a prince! - It's too short. - There's a hem, too. - I know, but I can't... - I'll find some change. - No, I have to give it all to my wife. - Well then? - Well... I have 200 lire. - Do you have another 50? - No, just 5. - That'll do just fine. - And you can take me to Villa Gloria. - Sorry, I have to get home. We won't be long. There's an important race on today. And I've been told about this horse that's a sure-thing to win it! - What is it? - Tell my doll that we're going to Villa Gloria. Today we'll win, I guarantee it! You're a joy to behold! Now we'll get you dressed for the races! - Are you coming to the woods with us? - No thanks, we're staying here. - Bye. - What do you have? - Beans, you? - Nothing, I've eaten it all already! - You want some? - No, thanks. - Because there are onions? - Of course not! Look... - I can't help it, like them. Thank God neither of us has a boyfriend! Something smells nice, how are you? - What an ill-mannered young woman. - Who's this? - It's the driver that... - Nannarella and I are too old friends. - Then I'll be going... - No, what do you want? - Ah, I see you understand certain situations. - Yes, I don't miss a thing. - Excellent. Well? - So I'm staying. - I have to speak with her in private. Nannarella, I don't like this guy. A nice girl, your friend. The kind of girl you can't help but like. - Well, I'm leaving. - No! You're pretty when you're angry. - What do you want? - Why have you stopped eating? Don't be afraid. - I'm not eating because I don't want to. - But you were eating before... - And I'm not now. - Are you happy that your dad is okay? - My dad could have seriously hurt himself. - That's what they say. - But tonight we won't talk about it. - Tonight? - What time should I pick you up? At 7, 6? - I don't want anything to do with you. - Why not? I'm nice. - Nice? Ha! - I know you like me really. - Violets for the pretty lady? - There are no pretty ladies here. - Just 2 lire for a bunch. - Here you go. - Two bunches, that's 4 lire. - Get out of here! - Nannarella, shall we go? - Yes. - They're for you. - Thanks, but I don't need them. Anna Rosa is the horse for me! I'm feeling lucky today, I tell you! Let's go. - Augusto! - Antonio! Are you playing? - No, just dropped someone off, you? I've put my bet down already, they're about to run. You should play too. - You know me, I only play Zibid? Zibid?! - Then you'll always be a poor man! Five... 500 lire. - My change? - Change? What change? - I gave you 500 lire. - So? - I said 5 lire! The minimum bet is 500 lire, it's written up there. I only have 500 lire, I didn't want to bet all of it. - How would I know that? - Then just give me the money back. Are you kidding? I've closed, the horses are running, you should go and check if you've won. Damn it! Screwed over! - By a head, I can't believe it! - Always an idiot. - She should have won! - Which horse won? - Anna Rosa should have won! - Excuse me, which horse won? - Which horse did you bet on? Ah, you won! You lucky thing! Fior di Rosa came in first. - You won by a hair! - Are you kidding? - No, you're rich! - Where do I go? - Over there. - Sorry, I don't know what I'm doing. You have to get used to all that confusion. I have to go as well. If you like, I'll give you the money here. - How much... - 500, so that's 5,000. - I don't know how to thank you. - Oh, it was nothing! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - You have no idea what you're doing! - I've lost all my money. - I won! - Won?! With which horse? - The one you said, Fior di Rosa. - But I bet on Anna Rosa. - Ah, I thought that... So you won by mistake?! Toto, you're a phenomenon! Let's go for a drink! - Well, I should drop you off here. Good evening, Miss. - Come on, move you. "Come on, move you!" Did you hear how she talks? - I don't understand either of you! - "Get up from there!" "Get up", instead of "Get down"! - She's a mean one alright. - Mr. Doriani... - Valentino. Valentino, tomorrow you're coming to my place for lunch. A meal you'll never forget! We'd be extremely happy to attend. As happy as we are right now! I'm happy and I don't even have a penny in my pocket, see? - Perhaps this will make you happier. - I'm afraid I can't take it. - Careful, you'll tear it! - Toto, you're a phenomenon! A kiss! - They'll give me a fine for parking here. - A kiss for the horse! Let's take a stroll, little one. May our steps be light enough... ... to carry us up into the sky. - Toto! What happened to you? - I'll tell you all about it at the pub. Get the good wine ready, tonight it's on me! - See you later, guys... - Hey, lads! - Leave them alone. All of you in the carriage! Today, everything's on me! - See you, Cacarella. - See you later! Paradiso! Paradiso! - Mr. Toto! - A double helping of broccoli leaves for my faithful steed. Paradiso, you're beautiful! - I could kiss you! - Toto, here's your wife! Now watch her make a scene. Bye... Paradiso, get out of here! Were you worried, doll? - What have you done? - See how elegant I am? Now let's take a stroll, little one. May our shoes be as light as... let's just go. - Good evening, Nannarella. - Ah, it's you. To your good health! Cheers! I want to buy everyone a drink! More wine! Augusto, more wine! Ladies and gentlemen, we will now sing you a beautiful Roman song. - What's the name of the song? - "Under a Roman pine." - Take it away! "How pretty Rome is in the springtime!" "It seems to breath happiness." "All the fountains, at night, that sound like they're singing." "Even whose who don't love to dream, long for a mouth to kiss!" "Under a Roman pine..." "... how wonderful it is to dream..." "... while the sun bathes everything in gold and then slowly disappears." Alright, I'm not drinking. These dolls! - Can I eat something, at least? - Yes. "Come close to me, we'll watch the moon come out..." "... under a Roman pine!" - Don't you have someone waiting for you? - Yes, Nannarella is waiting for me. I don't believe it, I bet there's someone else. Perhaps, but I'm staying with you for now, otherwise I'll just offend you. - Goodbye, then. - Two bags. - I'm going home, I said. - Then just one. - I have to go home, don't you understand? - How much is that? - One lira. - How much? - One lira! - We make a great impression, us two. Come on, give me your arm. - To you? - You don't like men who eat nuts? - Funny! If you don't give my your arm, I'll throw a nut at this man and say it was you. One, two... will you give me it? Three! - What's going on? - Sorry, we were just joking around. - I don't like those kind of jokes. - But I just apologised. What if I threw you in the river and then apologised? It's not like I threw the bag at you. - You want to throw the bag at me? - No, I was just saying. - Now we'll see what you have to say! - It was just for a laugh. And I'm here to make you cry! Sir, it wasn't him, it was me. I'm very sorry, good evening. You're two great artists, I'm telling you! - This is for you. - Toto, that's all you have left! No, art must be encouraged! Today I met an artist, a comic... - And I gave him some... - Some what? A kiss, I gave him a kiss! I love everyone, you know! - Will you sing me "The Roman Pine"? - Everyone together! - We'll all sing! "Under a Roman pine, how wonderful it is to dream..." "... while the sun bathes everything in gold and then slowly disappears." - Toto, it's getting dark. - You're right. You turn out the lights, I'll pay for the wine. The millionaire is going home! Goodbye! Bye! I'll have a word with that friend of mine... - Good evening, Toto. - Good evening. - Toto, your change! - Kid, the change is yours. Thanks. Girl, come here right now. Don't you move. - Take her home. - What are you going to do? - Nothing, just talk. I just want to tell him that I'm okay. Go on, I'll be right there. Go on, I won't be long. How long have you been seeing my girl? - I see you're feeling fine. - Yes, I'm fine. Answer the question. It's nothing, I met her and wanted to know how you were feeling. Well that's the first and last time. I'm feeling fine, you needn't bother her again. - But last night you wanted to... - I did, but now I'm not interested. I could make your father pay dearly, but I've decided to leave it alone. - Don't you understand that my father... - I don't want to hear it. Get out of here. - What does he have to do with it? - You're one and the same. Now get going. - I don't want to see you around here again. - This is your neighborhood, is it? - No. - No, I just don't like you. - Well, perhaps someone else does. - What do you mean by that? - Careful, you'll ruin my suit. I should ruin both you and your father! Go on, get going. Get out of here. - It was him that wanted to come. - I don't want to hear about it. You had to meet him, of all people. Come on, don't worry. Your dad knows that it's not your fault. - What did that kid say to you? - Toto... - Quiet! Leave us alone. - Well? - I met him on the street and he asked me how you were. - Nothing else? - No. - He's a delinquent, just like his father. And when I tell you not to talk to anyone, I expect you to listen, alright? Understand?! - You've no idea how evil the world is. - He only walked me home. Yes, that's how it always starts. But you don't know how it ends! Don't cry, come on. That's all I have to say. I know that you're a saint. We won't speak about those people any more, they make my blood boil. Tonight we're supposed to be happy. - Adelina, didn't you tell her? - Not yet. Didn't your mother tell you? I'll show you something. Know what this is for? Presents! This is a nice new dress for Nannarella, new shoes for Nannarella... ... a pretty bag, and this... This one's a coat for your mother, otherwise I'll offend her. A pair of socks... I can buy myself a pair of socks, can't I? This is for presents, girls! Now give your old man a kiss. Toto, Mrs. Adelina! See? When you have money, all your friends suddenly turn up. See? Presents. To earn this much I'd have to ride that horse round the world three or four times! From tomorrow it's a new life for us, no more work and we'll get a butler, too. Come over here. - What's your name? - Andrea. Andrea? No, your name is Battista, you're a butler now. So get rid of this moustache and let your sideburns grow, tomorrow's a new day! Tomorrow I'll wake up at 9, perhaps even as late as midday. Breakfast in bed, chocolate for the countess, sandwiches for the princess! - So it's true?! Let me see. - Careful! I've never seen so much money! Why didn't you tell me anything? Because you'd have died of shock! This is all for presents, anyway. - Toto, are we having a party? - Of course, a big lunch tomorrow! - I wouldn't want to be that lamb! - Lamb and potatoes! Can I try one? - Later. - You little devil! - Perhaps I can give them a hand over here. - No, you're a guest! It's almost ready! - Don't bang so loudly, the guy living below is always angry. - Let him come up! I'm the porter, and that guy living below you is unfriendly even to me. Then we'll move house, that way he won't have to hear us anymore. Right, an apartment in the Parioli quarter. - And I'll be a porter with a uniform! - An elevator and hot baths! - It's only 5,000 lire! - There, it's all grated. Let each person put it on their own plate. Sit down. You, sit there. You, there... - No, this seat's taken. - By who? - By who? I'll show you. Here you go, my son. Your son? Very handsome, looks just like you. Yes. Now I'll introduce you. - This is Valentino Doriani, comic. - A real pleasure. - Giulio Urbani. - Where is he, what's he doing? Flying. My big boy. What did I tell you? It's him. You can answer the door. - Don't worry, I'll get rid of him. - Can we start? - No, you can serve. The same for everyone, including Andrea. Less for the young man as he's on a diet. - Is Antonio Urbani here? - That's me. - You're to come with us. - Where? - The chief of police wants to see you. - Why? - He'll explain everything. - Toto! - Excuse me a moment. - Do you need help? I'll be right there, it's just two friends of mine. - We have to hurry. - What happened? We're having a party, couldn't you drop by later? No, you'll have to come right away. Alright, but my wife has a weak heart, she might start feeling ill. I don't... I'll sort him out... These gentlemen are here to... - We had an appointment. - Really, today? Yes, I was interested in buying a car, and they're from the car company. Right? - So, what? - Well, I have to go with them. What a shame! Adelina! - What is it? - I forgot to mention. Haven't you started? - We were waiting for you! - What? - Yes, I'm going to look at a car. Don't look at me like that. It's a good price, they're serious people, right? May I introduce myself? Valentino Doriani, comic. Please, sit down. - No, we're on our way out. - Then I'll come with you. - No, I'll be back in no time. - We'll wait for you. - No, go ahead. While I'm here, I may as well serve up. - Urbani, are we going? - Yes. They're in a hurry to sell this car. I'll serve my daughter, otherwise... - Bye, I'll be back with a beautiful car. - Hurry up. - Of course, I won't be long. - Who's the best drive in Rome? - Dad. - So you didn't open the suitcase? - How could I? I didn't have the key. - Right. - And you say that you didn't take it to the police because you had an accident. - Exactly! I was hit by another driver, I still have the marks to prove it. See? It's small, but... Very small, I see. And where did you have this accident? - Corso Umberto, there was a policeman... - We can check up on that. - You have to believe me! - No need to get worked up. - I know, but... The owner, a Miss Mary... ... returned from Civitavecchia and filed a report... ... saying that the suitcase can be opened and closed with ease. - So it's clear. - Perhaps... But tell me, who replaced the diamond in the ring with a false one? - I don't know. - You say that the suitcase was closed in the stable all night. - Yes. - So it could have been the stable boy. - No, he's a bit of an idiot... - Another coachman? - No. - Are you sure? - Well, it might have been... - That's more like it! Tell me, who did you sell it to? - I've never even seen it! - It's in your best interest to just confess. - Confess what? - And this? - I won it at the races. - Ah, I see. You're a gambler. - No, it was my first time. - And you won, well done! - When were you there? - Yesterday afternoon, I even ran into Augusto. - Augusto who? - Augusto Pallotta, he works for Gucciariello. - Nobody else? - No. Yes, Valentino Doriani, the comic. He was the one who took me there. He's at my house, why don't you ask him? He can tell you what happened, why else would I have invited him for lunch? So you won? In that case, I'm sure the person working at the racetrack would remember. - We'll ask him. - No... - What now? - I didn't collect my winnings from the desk. I'd never played, you see. It was my first time. Actually, I thought I'd lost. A guy came up and... well, he gave me the money. People giving out money like that? Who do you think you're kidding? - I swear that... - Enough! It would be better if you just confessed. Confess what, Sir? Alright, you can stay here with us and think it over... ... then talk to the judge tomorrow. You're locking me up? But my family's waiting for me at home! I've been working an honest trade for 30 years! My wife is ill, the poor thing... - We'll inform your family. - No, please don't tell them! Call Doriani, Andrea, don't tell my family! - It's nothing to do with me. - Look at me, do I look like a thief? Sir, it wasn't me! "... to say those simple little words..." "... the only one I love is you!" - The end sounds better longer, doesn't it? - Let's make it longer. - The reprise. - "All it takes is a..." - Let me sing it by myself, otherwise how will I learn? - Very well, go on. "All it takes is a flower, for love to blossom. All it takes is a flower..." I told that police chief, I want my money back. My money! Because if they found lots of money on that coachman, it must be mine! - But they say I have to wait for the trial. - Then just wait. Okay, from the top. - I'm just stressed! - I know, but what can you do? "All it takes is a flower, for love to blossom." "All it takes is a flower, for..." And the questions that police chief asked. Who gave you the diamond... How am I supposed to remember every single person who gave me gifts? - You'd need a good memory! - Exactly... - Let's start again. - ""All it takes is..." - No, from where we left off. "You're the one in my dreams..." "... the only one I love." "But you don't know..." "... that we share so much. "All it takes is a flower..." I have a three-month contract in Milan... ... and I have to wait for this stupid trial. - Just think of the publicity, though! - Everyone will be talking about you. - That's right, my name will be everywhere. - It'll be a huge success! - You'll be a star! Watch where you're putting your hands! Come on, let's get on with it. "All it takes is a flower, for love to blossom." Nannarella! Nannarella! - What does the lawyer say? - I don't know, we can't afford a lawyer. - They seized all our money. - They'll acquit him, he's innocent. All of us will testify, but he'll still need a lawyer. - Mother is always crying... - Hey, I know someone who can help. - He did have a misunderstood face. - You think so? I've never met a more honest man. Why are you defending him so much? Because you didn't see the faces of those two women when they came to arrest him... ... I did, and it brought me to tears. - Ha, to tears! Did you hear that? That's right, and I'm not ashamed. Well, your sob story means nothing to me. You still owe me three months rent. - Miss, you are becoming monotonous. - Why are you defending him so much? Now he's inside, want to know why? Because he's a delinquent. He deserves it. I don't know how they can arrest a poor family man on mere suspicion alone. Suspicion? Is that what they call it? What about the 5,000 lire he had? - He won it at the races, I was there. - Gambling, instead of paying rent! I work all day, just for people to steal my things and... ... sell them for gambling money. - When did you ever earn anything? - It's all gifts and presents. - What do you mean by that? I work, nobody gives me anything. - Exactly, they give them to me! - Go on, get out of here! - Listen, Toto is innocent! - Really? Then it must have been you! - You were the one who opened it! - What do you mean by that? - Nothing. - Men in need of money will do just about anything! - This is slander! - Careful now! What are you trying to say? - I think you understand quite clearly! Remember that I'm a gentleman! My work earns me more than enough! Oh, your work! His work! He never does a thing! He doesn't work unless they pay him well, he's a failure! - Stop that. - Or what? You're a failure, a failure! You never make anyone laugh, all you get is whistles and boos. You're a vulgar ballerina and make no mistake! Get out of my sight! Good evening, Dad. Nannarella, this is my father. - Do you remember Nannarella, Dad? - Of course, but you were so little. Yes, you've become a beautiful woman. Still, I bet your family doesn't like me. - We have to help them, Dad. You're not still angry, are you? - No, but I should be. Your father is too attached to tradition... ... and that's a stupid attitude to have. Sometimes he doesn't know what he's saying, and if I hadn't been careful... ... it would be me in jail instead of him. Sorry, I spoke without... Your father is a good man, and I don't hate him, actually... - We'll come up with something. - No, Nannarella has to be getting home. - Dad, can't you find a lawyer for Toto? - Of course, we'll do whatever we can. - I hope you're not mad at me? - No. - Good, everything will be fine. Can you obtain a visiting permit for his wife, too? The lawyer will take care of that, don't worry. - I'll walk you out. - I'll do it, I'm sure you're busy. - Sir! Sir! - What do you want? - My wife isn't here! Urbani! - She's coming now. - Toto! Toto, how are you? - Fine. Sorry I'm late, I was busy with the lawyer. How are you? - Fine, how's Nannarella? - Fine, fine. You've lost weight, are you eating? Of course. Today they gave us spaghetti with parmesan..... ... lamb chops with potatoes... ... a quart of win, you know, I even left the peas. We do fine here. Look at this kid. He was so small, look how big he is now. - How did you get in here anyway? - It was the lawyer. We don't need a lawyer, I'm innocent. - Pasquale is taking care of it. - What does he have to do with this? Why did you go to him? I don't want help from anyone. Is Nannarella still seeing that kid? I told her she isn't to see him! - Don't get angry, it's for the testimony. - I don't need a testimony. Everyone knows that I'm innocent. What do people say about me? You know, if they ask you anything, just tell them I'm away on business. Not for the people, but for the boy, for our Giulio... If he knew, it would tear him up. He's doing his duty, and it would only make a bad impression among his peers. Adelina, I can't sleep! - Time's up! - Goodbye! - Where are they taking you now? Miss, they're taking us outside in the garden to play. They have a swing out there, too! Adelina! I'll see you the day after tomorrow at the trial. Bring Nannarella, too. Bring everyone, Andrea... all of them! And be sure to get a good seat at the front, so you have a better view. Bye! Don't worry! - There's Toto! - Toto, we're over here! Good evening. Andrea, you're here as well! It's nothing, you know... The honourable judge! - Are you the one who got Toto arrested? - Get away from me! Silence! Antonio Urbani, of Luigi and Anita Baratelli. 45-years-old, residing at number 13, Vico del Piede. - Employed as a coachman. - That's me. "You are accused of replacing a diamond found..." "... in a suitcase..." - That's not true! Which one's our lawyer? - I'm here, don't worry. - Yeah, but he said that I... Please, behave yourself. "In a suitcase belonging to a miss Maria Dunchetti..." "... which she left behind in your carriage." - Can I at least listen? - No. - I won't get you in trouble. - You can't go in. - Important as we are, they make us wait outside! - Antonio Urbani, did you hear the accusation? - Yes, but it's all lies. - Do you confess to the crime, yes or no? - I confess to being innocent. - That's it, Toto! - Silence! The accused has declared his innocence, let's hear from the plaintiff. Miss Maria Dunchetti, please. - What are they doing? - They're questioning the plaintiff. - Miss, where did you buy the ring? - I already said, in Milan. You don't have the receipt, so you will have to give us... ... the name of the shop and street. - How am I supposed to remember that? - You must remember! - Ah yes, I remember now. - It was given to me. - By whom? - These questions... - By a man. - Why? - What does that matter? - Answer the question! It was for a tribute show. - Tribute show! Where's the car? - Downstairs. Paradiso, go and inform the lawyer. Get Andrea, everyone, let's go! - Calling to the stand, Augusto Pallotta. - Augusto Pallotta! - Augusto Pallotta! - That's me. - Move it, we're waiting for you! - Were you at Villa Glori on the 26th of April? - Yes. - Do you know the accused? - Toto's a friend of mine. - Did you meet him at the races? - Yes. - Did you see him place his bet? - No, he didn't bet. - What? - You didn't. - What would you know? - You told me you weren't playing. - But you... sorry, but.. - I asked if you were playing... - Take your hat off! - What are you doing? - I did afterwards! - You said that you only play Zibid? Zibid?. - But... Enough, get back to your places! You, come here! Come here! You must only speak to me! Silence down there in the front! Now, what is this Zibid? Zibid?? - You play it with the little balls. - Balls? - You put the ball here, and "Zibid?, Zibid? and in the hole!" - Have you really never played it? - I'm afraid not. Silence! Back to your place! - Zibid?, Zibid?! Call another witness. - Ottone Roncucci. Ottone Roncucci! Ottone Roncucci! Thank God I remembered. Some tribute show! Hurry, Roberto! - I can't go much faster than this! - But you have to! Quick, overtake that car! - Ottone Roncucci! - If you don't call him by his nickname, he won't come. - Paradiso! - What? - Get over here. - Here I am! Present! Present! Good morning, Toto. - Toto is innocent! Is that okay? - Talk to me. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Say "I swear". - Present! - No, say "I swear". - I swear! - Say that you swear! - I swear. - So the suitcase was in the stable all evening, did you see it? - I swear. - No, I asked if you saw it. - Eh! - What do you mean, "eh!"? - Eh! - You have to answer "yes" or "no"! - Present! Silence! Please try to understand me. Was the suitcase closed or open? - What was it? - Yellow. - It was closed, you idiot! Closed! - Toto, I don't understand him! What's there to understand? Answer the questions that the nice judge asks you. - Then I'll give you a little something... - Corruption, in the courtroom?! Please, your honour, consider that a comment one made out of candour. Listen to me. Don't worry, don't get yourself worked up. Are you able to respond to the questions I'm asking? Are you able? - Eh, yes! Eh, eh! - Good gracious! Silence! This man's an idiot, take him away. Call another witness. - You can go and sit down now. - Roberto Finelli. Roberto Finelli! - Quick, quick! - There's a roadblock. If they stop us, we're finished. - Go through, it doesn't matter. - They'll get the license plate. - Who cares! - Roberto Finelli! - He's not here. - He's absent. I'm his father. My son we here until a moment ago, I don't know where he's gone. See what he's done? Ran me over, got me arrested, and now he's run off. - Toto... please, allow me to say a few words. - I don't want anything from you, thanks. - Lawyer, can't you explain it to them? - Pipe down! What do you expect me to do? The testimony is against you. One witness is missing, the other's an idiot... - I'd like to call Valentino Doriani. - Valentino Doriani! - Quick, quick! - We're almost there. - Thank goodness, I hope we make it. - Valentino Doriani! - Don't cry Adelina, otherwise I won't bring you here again. - Doriani is absent! - Another one. What am I supposed to do?! Just a moment! Your honour, let me speak, I can explain everything. - Mr. Nardi! - That's me. - Do you recognise me? - Come with us. - Where? - We'll explain in the car. My uncle was accused and condemned to three years in confinement. - Three long years, and why? - Why? - For a wallet that could have been empty. - But it was full of money. - Yeah... - He stole it. - Yes. - So he was guilty! - My uncle, yes... - But Toto is innocent! - What are you saying? Go and sit down! Andrea, go and sit down, you're only making things worse. - I have to... - But what... - Back to your place, now! - I hope it isn't over already. - I'm sure it'll be fine. I'll sort that ballerina out. You'll see! Miss Mary, the noted star that I have the honour to represent... ... is unable to show us the receipt for the purchase of the diamond. This is the only thing the Defense has against her. But please consider the frenetic pace at which she is forced to live. Always traveling from one city to another. It's only natural that she might forget to retain such a receipt. Her forgetting of the suitcase in the carriage illustrates this fact. I ask that you consider the highest penalty possible for the accused. I have to say something important, Toto is innocent! Silence, or I'll throw you all out! Why are we going so fast? The word of the Defense. Your honour, it is a terrible case, and one that I beg you to look upon... ... not with the eyes of implacable justice... ... but with eyes that are more understanding of human nature. - They said to waste a bit of time. - Why? - I don't know. - Get out of here! Consider the life of this man. The misery that has accompanied him from his birth until this very day... ... but he has still managed to do that single and most noble duty of men. In such disastrous conditions, Antonio Urbani has raised a family. Try to imagine the life of this man. His trade, which may seem simple and quiet to you and I... ... but which is instead one of the most extreme and tiring! Antonio Urbani has spent 40 years sitting on a horse! What do you think I am, a statue? He has spent 40 years sitting in a carriage pulled by a horse... ... through the cold, the rain, and the snow. Then through the heat and the sun... I don't wish to abuse your gracious attention any longer... ... but hope that you will understand my client. Thank you. Keep it going! Look at this man, he is the father of a family. He thought he was doing good, but he made a mistake. So I beg you to treat his case with understanding and indulgence... ... because this is the only way that he will know and be able to redeem himself. - I've finished. - Thank goodness! A few more words and they'll execute me. Silence! I told you to be silent! We suggest a sentence of 2 years and 6 months in confinement... ... considering the nature of the crime and time wasted on the justice system. - Do you wish to add anything in your defense? - What can I add, your honour? I'm innocent! - In the name of... - Just a moment! I swear to tell the whole truth! May I? Valentino Doriani, comic. The truths regarding the races and the accident are not important. The only important thing is that Mr. Oreste Nardi gave the ring to Miss Mary. - Miss Dunchetti, come here. - Me? - Yes, you. Come up here. - Do you know this man? - Yes. - Is it true that he gave you the ring? - Yes. - Is this the ring you gave her? - Yes. What does this matter? The coachman's crime remains. - Ask him where he bought it. - You bought it in Milan? - No, in Frascati. - Why? In what circumstances? - I told you, for my tribute show. - Ask him how much he paid for it. - How much did you pay? 180 lire. - Toto, how did it go? - It went well, you saved my life! Thank you everyone! - Goodbye. - Are you coming with us? - No, I'm afraid I can't. I had to come to Rome anyway. Congratulations! Here I am! I just watched Mary faint, what a sight! Where's Roberto? Leave them alone, come on. Roberto was the one who saved you it was him who went to get Oreste Nardi. We did 50km, and it was all down to him. And now they're going to take away his license, but he's really a good kid. Who knows what will happen to him. What are you doing here? Come on, move it! The horse went a bit crazy, started galloping like that. Could you take her home, please? Go on. Such a gallop! It felt like we were in the wild west! - Thank you, Dad! - Why? I'm not going anywhere. Get in. Where are you going? Sit up front. Oh, Dad! Thank you. - Bye, Dad! - Bye, Toto! - We'll see you at home. - Coachman, take me to the station. - Sorry, I'm not on duty. - What do you mean? - And that's not up for discussion! Bianchina, forgive me if I made you nervous back there... ... but I had to do it. Now we can make our way home slowly. I'll make you a soft bed of hay and some food. Do you forgive me? Give me a kiss. - Well? - Well what? - Will you take me to the station? - No, the carriage is occupied. - But the flag is raised. - And occupied by who? - By me. - But you're the coachman. Are you kidding? No, I'm a gentleman. The coachman is up there, see? She's up front. Take me home! Goodbye.
