Eagle of the Pacific Directed by Isiro Honda The dead do not come back. There is no way to return the old days. However, think about the history. In order not to repeat our mistakes, each of us must calmly evaluate our past and to draw conclusions based on their own experience. First, it is necessary to kill someone ... Prime Minister Keisuke Okada. Minister Keisuke... Next, the plutocratic delegate. Chairman of the State Bank Korekiyo Takahashi. Chairman Takahashi ... Next, the embodiment of capitalism itself. Kantar≈ç Suzuki Suzuki. And after that... Isoroku Yamamoto, Deputy Navy Minister. Isoroku Yamamoto? That's why I say that you do not understand the situation. Yamamoto is a major figure in the Anglo-American faction. Do not you know that he is their representative? Just look at the state of the fleet. This Isoroku Yamamoto acts contrary to the situation in China and the Tripartite Pact. While he did not destroy our fleet, until he is eliminated, Japan can not move forward. Navy Ministry Connect me with the Deputy Navy Minister Yamamoto. Yokosuka Aviation Detachment? Deputy Minister Yamamoto, please. Deputy Minister Yamamoto. An urgent call from the Minister. Admiral? The Minister called and requests you get back to the Ministry as soon as you can. During the flight the ailerons do not work properly. This is especially true at low speeds. Because the stick begins to twitch. And if I drastically raise the nose, the plane will snap into a spin. The Admiral seems very tired. All this as well as working at Headquarters. Yes, I think he should quit as Deputy Minister. The aircraft of our fleet are sparrows. But, this man is a real eagle. It seems to have ended. In general, I would like to see him once again became a wild eagle. Attention! Salute! Navy Minister This is the second attempt... ...on your life. Threatening letters come... ...about once a week. In truth, you are my closest aide. Perhaps this is due to the fact that you, my deputy, should occupy my position. But in view of the circumstances ... ...your safety has become difficult to guarantee. As for me, I think you need to leave this office. I am happy to remain your deputy. Thank you for your concerns. Minister, what will happen to the Tripartite Pact if I resign? This senseless pact must be avoided at all costs. Even at the sacrifice of our own lives. But... Minister. I have served in the Navy for 33 years. Whether I die at sea or on land, it should be for the benefit of our country. At least, that's how I see it. The private residence of the Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe How long can this take? Hard to say. The Deputy Minister is as stubborn as ever. Admiral Yamamoto? Yes. But still I do not understand. Why is he so against the Tri-Partite Pact? If we sign it, we will certainly enter into a war with America. Isn't the object of the Tri-Partite Pact just the Soviet Union? Admiral Yamamoto ... ...worries that Germany will fight against England and France. Then America would the join the war. So any alliance with Germany and Italy ... Japan will inevitably have to fight against America. Then in fact it is necessary to proceed with caution. And they are in such a hurry ... Our current situation is precisely why it is necessary to hurry. War with China devours our military strength. It's because of all those empty houses on the border between the Soviet Union and Manchuria. Manchuria is threatened by pressure from the Soviet Union. If we are not careful now, our previous efforts may come to nothing. Why did the Army leadership not disclose this information to the Navy? After concluding this powerful military alliance, it will be possible to respond to any aggression by the Soviet Union. Japan attacks from the east and Germany from the west. This is such a profitable alliance, and they do not seem to understand this. After more than a year, they still can not agree. And so on ... this is a critical time for the country. The 'ABCD' countries keep adding economic pressure on our country, one after another. If nothing is done, our nation will be unable to survive. What of the Navy, and the Cabinet of Ministers ... ...and leadership of the Army? The Ministry of the Army is in solidarity with signing the Pact. As is public opinion. To speed up the conclusion of the Pact, it is necessary to involve the Army to court the people. If one hundred million people speak as one demanding it, it will happen. National Spiritual Mobilization Movement The Cabinet meeting started early morning. They are reviewing this question many times. Could it be that Prime Minister Konoe dissolves the cabinet? No, do not worry about that. Signing it would be good for both the Army and Navy but the limitations of the Pact is something the Army can not accept. Japan, Germany and Italy are building a new world order. For our country, which is poor in resources, it is very tempting. But if Japan should sign this agreement, according to Admiral Yamamoto, the clash with England, America and France is inevitable. This was what he said before and we too must speak carefully. It's too much. Recent popular demonstrations ... Mr. Sekina, you and I ... ...No, the entire Japanese nation will be held responsible... ...for acts committed by the militarists. Corruption of our political parties has created these soldiers. We ignored the moral decline of these political parties, the government by assassination which has given rise to the current control of our nation by the military. Don't you agree? What kind of person is this Yamamoto? What kind of person, you ask? Already six months since Prime Minister Hiranuma formed a new cabinet, and five Ministries meet to debate the Pact for the 70th time. 70 times! But Admiral Yamamoto continues to stubbornly defend his position. His perseverance and belief ... It is difficult to understand. But the opinion that the Tri-Partite pact will unleash a Japanese-American War ... ...has began to spread among the people. The Army considers the Pact really beneficial, but the Navy is worried, and so they are cautious, wanting to see how world events develop. General Oshima, our ambassador to Germany, has reported on the main provisions regarding the Tri-Partite Pact and the German government. He says that based on the current situation in Europe, Germany sees no benefit in the Anti-Comintern Pact. The subsequent policy of Germany and Italy is to gradually diminish the power of England and France. So that their military alliance is only against the Soviet Union, At the moment, it is not of any value. As for the report of the Army. With these being Germany's intentions, would it not better to conclude a Pact aimed not only against the Soviet Union but also against America and Britain? After the outbreak of hostilities in Manchuria, England and America have become our enemies, like the Soviet Union. But how? Special! Special! Special, special edition, special edition! What? Show me. A Non-aggression Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. What does that mean? What is it? Germany has reconciled with the Soviet Union? What then will become of the alliance between Japan and Germany? After Germany and the Soviet Union shook hands? Japan must get something in return for Germany getting something. The Army was close to achieving it's goal to approve the Tri-Partite Pact when the Hiranuma cabinet collapsed. When you ceased to be Deputy Minister, you became Commander-in-Cheif of the Combined Fleet, which has caused a terrible commotion. Everyone thought that you would become the next Minister of the Navy. Now I can go to sea and safety. I too sleep more soundly. Now you only need to worry about further actions in China. It seems that our soldiers now have more confidence. Because now they can fight in China without worrying about the complex political situation in Europe. Now everything has become much easier. I, in turn, have another year and a half of hard work at sea. A year and a half? At that time, I will have served in the Navy for 35 years. After completing a final tour of duty as the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, I can retire from the service, return to my native Nagaoka, and quietly live out the remainder of my days reading books. So, you are going to retire no matter what? It is a special pity that after you leave I will have no one to drink with. Come on now, instead of drinking sake, I want to sing. Sing? I was nineteen when I entered the military, thinking of General Yamamoto, who served under the warlord Uesugi. Fighting battles like those at Kawanakajima ... this was my calling. "The sound of a whip in solemn silence" "It crosses the river at night" The Combined Fleet, under the command of Admiral Yamamoto, blockades the coast of China and launches air strikes from it's aircraft carriers. While war games have been conducted day and night for the last year in the Pacific Ocean. At this time, Hiranuma and his cabinet resigned over the continuing war in China and Mongolia. Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai organizes a new cabinet, trying to resolve the situation in China. Meanwhile, in Europe, in spite of the anti-Comintern pact, Hitler gives the order to attack, and German troops invade Poland. They then conquer The Netherlands, Belgium and France, And prepare to invade England. The Inland Sea. Off the coast of Kure Thank you for calling me away from all the heat in Tokyo. By the way, there's been another change in the government. Yonai is going to resign as Prime Minister. Was it because of the Arrmy demands for the Tri-Partite Pact? Along with many of the cabinet representatives for the Navy. However, there are those in the Army and Navy leadership who are still against it. Some of Yonai's Cabinet Ministers wanted to approach America about ending the war with China. If war with America is avoided, the people might then lose faith in the military. As a result, the cabinet, after a long time ... If the war with China ends then then the embargoes would all be lifted, it will raise the spirit of the Japanese people. Then the Army can no longer continue to expand their presence in China. They no longer have any reason to insist on the Tri-Partite Pact. Please... Incidentally, the Army, within the powers of the Cabinet, regarding the Tri-Partite Pact ... Tri-Partite Pact? After Germany won a number of victories in Europe, the Army will again raise the question of the need to conclude the Tri-Partite Pact. The next Prime Minister is going to be a Prince Konoe, a fierce supporter for removal of the militarists from government. The Army openly aimed at the overthrow of the current government. Why did the Minister of the Amy not comment on the situation? That's what I want to know. I'm a military man. Like you. As one soldier to another, can you clearly explain your position? Shunroku Hata I hereby resign from the post of Minister of War. Your request is accepted. Accept our gratitude for your long service. Then, please, recommend your successor. What should I tell the Imperial Palace? The successor of the Minister ... ...has not yet been decided. Given the present situation of the Army, inviting someone to the post of the Minister ... seems a very difficult task. Nevertheless, it can be done. You are now leaving the post of Minister. But you say you cannot offer anyone as your successor? Do you think that the Cabinet will be able to function without a Minister of War? Or will you offer to send in the resignation of the other ministers? Prime Minister. I contacted the Cabinet Secretary. All ministers have tendered their resignations. A second Konoe cabinet was created, holding the course for a new policy. Political parties ceased to fight for control with the government was in its current form. The situation in the Navy also had been influenced by public opinion. Following the resignation of Admiral Zengo Yoshida, Admiral Koshiro Oikawa became the new Navy Minister. Like the Admiral, I have reason to agree with the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact. If the Navy now goes against the Ministers, the Konoe Cabinet will fall causing a uproar. At such an important time, the Navy must not take on such a responsibility. At the same time, we must consider the opinion of the people to get out of the difficult situation in which we find ourselves. I hope you understand. I... I will not go against the Admiral to any great extent and interfere with maintaining good order and discipline in the Navy. However, there is one "but." There is something that I am very concerned about. Hear me out, please. While acting as the Deputy Minister, I strongly opposed the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, because I thought that, given the state of our forces at that time, it was imperative to avoid war with the United States. Now, after a year, with the Fleet now able to meet obliations of the Tri-Partite Pact, I will not express any opinion publicly. But are you sure that war against America will not break out? That's what I want you to explain to me. Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu has agreed, along with the Palace, in regard to concluding the Tri-Partite Pact, All military leaders have given their consent. It seems that our fate is already sealed. How are we going to deal with America? How do we win? What are our chances of success? Will our military leadership be up to the task? Captain Kadzo. Make a comparison chart of the Japanese and American industrial capacities. Remove as much of the details as possible. How much difference? The difference is very large. The comparative capacities is 10 to 3. Or may even be 10 to 1. These figures are correct. The Admiral was right. However, the outcome of the war depends not only on numbers. We won the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars in spite of our inferiority by the numbers. In modern warfare, it's different. In war games against America, there was only one case we obtained a decisive victory. So there is a chance of victory or defeat. Win or lose, it comes down to who has the greatest industrial capacity. This is the wrong argument. As a rule, we succeed with the weapons we already have on hand. Blessed be the life-force of the homeland. What happens if we dissipate it in this war? We win or lose ... How much is enough reason to continue to fight to the last? With America ... How to fight against America? And how to win this war? Although I am a soldier ... This time, I'm not sure. If the government decides on it ... I believe that the situation has taken a turn for the worst. It can be seen, it is the sad will of the gods. And yet it is necessary that someone speaks out on this subject. My position, personally, is in complete opposition to the general opinion, and so I must express my beliefs here. I find myself in a very strange position. Perhaps this too is part of my fate? This is my commitment ... After much deliberation, I concluded that in unleashing this war, the only way to start it is to strike hard at the enemy with everything we have. Such is the point of view that I hold. Pearl Harbor Plan of Attack Two of our aircraft carriers damaged, out of action. We destroyed the main enemy fleet. Our losses were two battleships sunk. But the defending enemy lost two-thirds of their fleet: 120 ships. Repeating the same war game make no sense. The war game is complete. I would like to know your opinion. Thank you. The question here is not whether to commit to this operation or not. If there is to be a Japanese-American War, this operation is absolutely necessary. Again, we need to carry out this operation. So each of you must once again calculate everything carefully. As I mentioned last time ... on the basis of intelligence, fleet size, use of military forces and other factors, I came to the conclusion that this is a hopeless war. No matter how much time I spend with the calculations, the outcome is always the same. We must use all six of our large aircraft carriers, plus two battleships and three cruisers. We need not only to provide them with fuel, but also send 30 escort and support ships. Japan must use all of our best ships and pilots, the best of the best. If we hit the enemy a powerful enough blow, they would find it impossible to continue the war. My conclusion is that in unleashing this war, we will lose it. Yes, a lot of reasons. I understand your concerns about the resources required. But... If, in the course of the war, the enemy should capture the strategically important Marianas Islands, he, putting naval and air bases there, will be able to attack the territory of Japan. What if he begins to launch attacks from the air on Tokyo or Osaka? Even at the risk that Tokyo and Osaka may become scorched plains, will you just sit back, stop fighting in Malaysia or the Philippines? Rather than wait until America becomes even stronger? We must fall on the enemy forces, with all we have at the moment. A decisive blow. There is no other way. Sting or be stung. If we fail in this battle ... we will lose, at it's very beginning, the Japanese-American War. So this battle is necessary. Even if each of you... and headquarters and the Ministry of the Navy ... ...are all categorically against this war. But... even if all of Japan is against it, I will implement this plan. If those who believe in me ... and all those who may come after me sail to Pearl Harbor. Then I, Yamamoto, am personally ... ready to sit in the first airplane and go to battle with the enemy. Aircraft will play a decisive role in this battle. Let all our pilots be well prepared, adhering during training to the plan of attack. I will personally meet with the American President. He is likely to make sure that negotiations do not resolve this situation. Those are my feelings. I understand. Why have you asked me here? I wanted to hear the details on the abilities of our fleet directly from you. That is why I asked you to come to Tokyo. Give me your honest opinion. If the negotiations do not lead to an agreement, what are our prospects in a war with America and Great Britain? For one year, I will run wild and win victory upon victory. One year? And if the war continues? After that, I have no expectation of success. I ask you to trust the Navy. Comparison of industrial power of Japan and America. Admiral. If, nevertheless, war begins, I am ready to sit in a plane, or sail on a ship, in the desperate fight for control of the Pacific Ocean. I... I will not tell you how to conduct military policy. You should seriously consider this issue. It is necessary to see these negotiations through to a successful end. If, however, negotiations do not go well, it still may be possible to avoid war. It is always possible to resort to other methods of negotiation. In diplomacy, there are no boundaries. Prime Minister. No matter how difficult, it is necessary for the Japan-US talks to reach an agreement. Of behalf of the entire fleet ... No, for the entire Japanese nation! I beg you. The meeting between American President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Konoe never took place. In October, the Konoe Cabinet fell apart and he resigned. General Hideki Tojo becomes Prime Minister and forms a new cabinet. Toward war. Toward war. Japan slowly moves toward war. Yamamoto's secret plan to attack Pearl Harbor was approved by the High Command. Thirty Sixth Fleet submarines are given sailing orders. With them are five midget submarines, heading for the eastern part of the Pacific Ocean. Three days before this ... The message "Climb Mt. Niitaka" means we are to execute the attack as scheduled. However, if the negotiations are successful before December 8, the message "Negotiations successful. Turn around." will be sent. In that case, each ship must immediately come back. That makes no sense. It's like something ... After preparations have come so far ... All the technical ... That would destroy morale. An impossible situation. Like trying to stop a volcano from exploding. For years, we have building up the fleet to protect the nation. If any officers are willing to disobey ... a direct order to return to base then let them resign now. Left rudder! Left rudder! Left rudder, steering 010 degrees! To maintain secrecy, the ships of the main attack force left port separately from each other. Each of them, out of sight of land, went north to Hitokappu Bay in the Kuriles where they gathered together. November 22, upon arrival the aircraft carrier Kaga, captans of thirty ships assembled on the flagship. There the Commander-in-Chief was given written orders for the attack. War Orders! War Orders! Point one: Our force is directed towards Hawaiian islands, where our goal is to attack and decisely defeat the US Pacific Fleet. Point two: The start of the war is "X Day", December 8, 1941 Tokyo time. November 26th, 8:00 am - All ships of the Mobile Force weigh anchor and sail to the eastern part of the Pacific Ocean. Meanwhile, in Hiroshima Bay aboard the battleship Nagato. Staff officer. Regarding the declaration of war ... Will it will be given to the Americans before our attack begins? Headquarters is agreed with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. thirty minutes before our attack begins. I see... I am worried about one thing though. With no prior declaration of war, we would be cutting the throats of a sleeping enemy, the Japanese fleet will be forever dishonored. Have our staff once again confirm with the Ministry. Negotiations have failed. So, after all, it's to be "Climb Mt. Niitaka"? Rudder amidships! Rudder amidships! Steady as she goes. Steady as she goes. See if anything has come? Anything from the Commander-in-Cheif about the beginning of the war? No news. List of ships in Pearl Harbor on December 6: 9 battleships, 3 cruisers, 3 aircraft carriers, 17 destroyers. In docks: 4 cruisers, 3 destroyers. No patrols seen. No unusual activity. Oahu quiet. No blackouts. Command is confident that our mission will succeed. It seems there is no choice. Steady on course 065 degrees! Steady on course 065 degrees! "Climb Mount Niitaka" War Orders! War Orders! First: X-Day is December 8 Tokyo time, December 7 Hawaii time. Repeat. X-Day is December 8 Tokyo time, December 7 Hawaii time. Next: To all officers and men of the Mobile Force from the Commander-in-Cheif of the Combined Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. "The fate of the Empire rests on the outcome of this battle." "Let each man do his utmost." Time: December 8, 1941, 1:30 Tokyo time. Location: 230 miles to the north of Pearl Harbor. Flight Quarters! Begin the attack. Admiral. Tokyo and Osaka are celebrating victory in battle. Maybe we drink a glass? No time to drink. It is necessary to plan the next attack. Well? The next attacks in the Pacific should be as successful as the initial ones made by the Mobile Force. We in Army believe that war with India is also necessary, and we've tried to bring it to the attention of the High Command, but they are fully engaged in the situation prevailing in the southern areas of military operations. Besides... Soon the first elections will be held for Prime Minister Tojo, so that now it is necessary to refrain from any military action requiring a lot of expenses. This area of military operations between Hawaii and New Caledonia. We must sever the enemy's lines of communications in order to be able to defend our conquests so we have decided to cooperate with the Navy. But the big question is how much effort that take? The Army will need at least 6-7 divisions in order to finish the war in the south. We pull them from the already-occupied territories leaving only a small force behind. and put most of them in forward defensive areas. On the Chinese front line or on the border with the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, Japan doesn't nearly have enough troops ... Yamamoto believes we would only have one year. Be sure... We must make effective use of the remaining time. It is not clear whether the current military leadership in Parliament, savoring the easy victories in this stage of the war, might consider those wanting peace now as traitors? At the same time they need to prepare for the next battle but will not. No preparation is permitted. Because of this, Admiral Yamamoto is very distressed. His request for an early retirement was rejected. He's getting a lot of problems to solve. How is the Commander of Combined Fleet supposed to solve them all? Here's how. Tell him to hurry. The US Navy delivers it's first counter-attack, having as its main force, the aircraft carriers Enterprise and Hornet. Admiral Halsey... ...launches bombers to attack Japan. North American B-25 bombers attack several Japanese cities. April 19, 1942 The Doolittle Raid Meanwhile, aboard the super-battleship "Yamato", the new flagship of the Combined Fleet. These strikes are nothing more than a simple attempt to boost US morale. We don't have a whole year to win this war. The differences in their and our military industrial power is too great. We must use the power of the fleet we have today... ...to win this war as soon as possible. But if we do not cooperate with the Army, the great war ... Enough already about the Army. Opinions about this situation will not change. Worry about the Navy. After this next military operation, I wonder if anyone would object if I personally start peace negotiations. Tell that to Admiral Yonai. Those responsible for military operations must refrain from interfering in politics. But, if the ultimate objective in this war is to be obtained, I'll ask one more time to give me the freedom to command. Midway Plan of Attack The attack on Midway. The operational objectives are: First of all, carry out an attack on the island of Midway to create a military base. Then, having obtained full control of the area, defeat the US fleet when it comes to defend Midway. Participating forces: the majority of of the Combined Fleet. Namely, 350 warships totaling half a million tons. 1,000 aircraft and 100,000 men. This battle is on an unprecedented scale - the largest naval action in history. The overall plan will be... the First Carrier Striking Force under Admiral Nagumo with the aircraft carriers Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu and Soryu, will depart Hiroshima bay the morning of May 27. to a point 250 miles northwest of Midway, they destroy the enemy defenses on Midway and then cover the invasion forces. After which, our carriers must move toward the US Navy ships coming from Hawaii and attack them. Meanwhile, Admiral Hosogaya's Northen Area Force with the aircraft carriers Ryujo and Junyo proceed to the Aleutian Islands where they launch a diversionary attack on Dutch Harbor and then invade Attu and Kiska. Admiral Yamamoto will remain with the battleships Yamato, Mutsu and Nagato together with 32 ships of the Main Body 600 miles west of Midway. On May 29, the Invasion Force under Admiral Kondo leaves their anchorage and moves to a point 400 miles from Midway Island. June 5: The First Carrier Striking Force arrives in their designated place. From there, the first strike force against Midway will be launched consisting of 36 fighters, 36 dive bombers and 36 high-level bombers. Total 108 aircraft. The main aim of this military operation ... is not the capture of some inconsequential atoll in the middle of the Pacific. The Americans must commit their remaining aircraft carriers to the defense of Midway. Lie in wait for the US Navy. Surprise and destroy them. The primary objective is to sink the remaining American aircraft carriers. The first air strike flies towards Midway. June 4, 1942 (Midway time). Flying time: 1 hour 45 minutes. Sergeant Hatsumoto! Send a message to our carriers: "Need a second strike against Midway." I understand send a message "Need a second strike against Midway." Radio message from the Midway air strike. Need a second strike against Midway. We need a second strike against Midway. Radio message from the Midway air strike. Second strike to the flight deck. Prepare for take-off. Second strike to the flight deck. But it's not right. The second strike force is equipped with torpedoes to use against enemy ships if any are sighted, We can't use torpedoes on land targets. Scout No. 4 left 2 hours and 40 minutes ago. He hasn't reported in yet. We do not have any information about the location of the enemy aircraft carriers. Therefore, we must use our second strike force to attack Midway. The first strike was not enough. Waiting until tomorrow to attack again is impossible. We do not know where the enemy fleet is. Staff officer. Have our scout planes reported anything? So far no enemy sightings reported. Re-arm the second strike force and send them to Midway. The second strike force will be sent to Midway. Replace torpedoes with bombs. Order. Pass the word to replace torpedoes with bombs. Replace torpedoes with bombs. Help with loading bombs! Replace torpedoes with bombs. I've already changed two ... Message from scout no. 4 from the cruiser Tone. 10 enemy ships sighted. 10 enemy ships sighted. The second strike force is on alert to attack ships? Yes, they are. Wait, it was reported that they needed a second strike to attack Midway. You don't think they've left yet, do you? Probably. Has the second strike force left for Midway? No, not yet. The second strike force still has not been sent to the Midway. Very soon, they will take off to attack the enemy fleet. They will sink anything they find. The distance between us - 200 miles. But ten enemy ships? Any of them aircraift carriers? Who sent this message? Scout no. 4. Time of the message? 4 hours 28 minutes. Not much time. Send a message to the scout. "Report type of warships and maintain contact." Tell Tone's scout no. 4 to determine what type of enemy ships and to maintain contact. Message from scout no 4: Enemy force is 5 cruisers and 5 destroyers. Repeat: Enemy force is 5 cruisers and 5 destroyers. It seems there is no carrier. So, replace torpedoes with bombs for ground attack. Since there is no carrier. Our aircraft can cover the 200 miles to Midway in the blink of an eye. Then everything should go well. The second strike force can attack Midway with bombs, and while they're gone we land the first strike force and arm them with torpedoes in case the American carriers are found. It's very odd... ...that there is no carrier. - No. 312 ready! - Keep it up! - No. 321 ready! - Keep it up! - No. 317 ready! - Keep it up! 5 cruisers and 5 destroyers. Very suspicious that no aircraft carrier is present. Hey, an aircraft carrier! An enemy aircraft carrier is bringing up the rear. Let's send the second strike force from Soryu and Hiryu, however they're armed, against the enemy aircraft carrier. And then - the Akagi and Kaga ... But all their torpedoes have been replaced with bombs. Bombs fused for land targets won't be effective against warships. 5 cruisers and 5 destroyers. Plus one carrier bringing up the rear! This is it! What we've been waiting for. Admiral, the trap is about to be sprung. Staff officer, there was an aircraft carrier with the enemy ships. Put the unloaded bombs to the side and take off. But what about fighter escort? The first strike is waiting to land, running out of fuel. Soon, they'll have to ditch in the ocean. A small sacrifice for the sake of big gains. Sir, let's attack now. The bombs loaded on our planes aren't going to be effective. There have been no further messages from the Akagi regarding an attack? Correct, sir. But I'm sure Admiral Nagumo has the situation well in hand The second strike force must have already taken off to attack the enemy fleet. Soon they will have sunk the enemy aircraft carrier. But no message confirming that has been received? Thirty minutes. Within half an hour, we're sure to have confirmation we've defeated the enemy fleet. If you now start the attack, we can not use the dive-bombers. But if we send a strike force without the support of fighters, they becomes sitting ducks for enemy fighters. Message from Admiral Yamaguchi on Hiryu. Strongly urge we launch all available aircraft now. Repeat: Strongly urge we launch all available aircraft now. We can not expect to bomb them without fighter cover. We can not send His Majesty's men to a senseless death. If we lose our heads, we can not hope for a successful outcome. What then? Any attack must be effective. Let's recover all our airborne aircraft from the first strike to Midway. While they land, the second strike force will be re-armed with torpedoes and made ready to attack the enemy fleet. Once the second strike force is launched, re-arm the first strike force with bombs and use them to attack Midway again. Urgent message to all vessels. Remove all bombs and put torpedoes back on. Second strike force prepare immediately to attack the enemy fleet. Remove bombs and load torpedoes! Remove bombs and load torpedoes! When you will be ready to attack? By 7 o'clock? By 7 o'clock? By 7:30? By 7:30, right? Hurry! Urgent message from scout: Many enemy aircraft now heading toward you. -Finish up now! -Yes sir! Take off now! Air raid alert! Air raid alert! Hurry, hurry! The second strike force needs more ammunition. Strike force, alert! Strike force, alert! Hurry, hurry, don't wait. Hurry! Strike force, launch! Strike force, launch! Launching aircraft in 5 minutes. 5 minutes. Just 5 more minutes. Strike force, launch! Dive bombers! Enemy dive bombers! Damage control parties to the flight deck! Immediately contact the Engineering department! What? No answer? No answer! Fire mains out! Hangar deck on fire! Anti-aircraft gun no. 2 out of action! Need a corpsman! Contact Soryu. What? No answer? What about Kaga and Hiryu? What? Still no contact? Keep trying! What? Damage to the stern? The rudder is broken? Can not fix? Fire spreading on the hangar deck where the torpedoes are! Urgent message. It reads: "0725. Fires are raging aboard the Kaga, Soryu, and Akagi resulting from attacks carried out by enemy planes". What? "We plan to have the Hiryu engage the enemy carriers." "We are temporarily retiring to the north, and assembling our forces." The Combined Fleet is mustering it's strength to strike the decisive blow against the enemy. Firstly, the Hiryu is preparing to launch a counter-strike on the enemy. Second, the heavy cruisers of the Support Force are to undertake a night-time surface attack on the enemy. Third, the Northern Area Force with the aircraft carriers Ryujo and Junyo, having completed it's mission in the Aleutian Islands, will advance to the south to support the First Carrier Striking Force. Meanwhile, aboard the only surviving aircraft carrier Hiryu. It's strike force is preparing the last 16 aircraft for the upcoming battle. Lt. Tomonaga, Repair of the fuel tank on the left side after the first attack has not yet been completed. Okay. If the right tank is full then do not worry. I will fly it. Won't we have a one-way flight? No matter. We're late, so hurry up. Later, a second strike force from the American carrier Enterprise arrives. Hiryu Finally, the last remaining carrier of Japan's First Carrier Strking Force, in spite of a desperate struggle, was reduced to blazing wreck. Staff officer, it seems that Ryujo and Junyo will be too late. Is there any further information from them? They have been unable to determine the enemy's location. Calling for the Chief-of-Staff. Speaking ... Sir, we cannot maintain this speed much longer. How about we turn around? No! We will never retreat. How we can slink away so shamefully? No, no! Staff officer, it is too early to give up. When night falls, we will send ships to attack the enemy. Let us join battle with the enemy by all possible means. We must avenge our defeat at Midway. Hour after hour, the odds were getting worse. The enemy fleet retired to the east and our forces were unable to find it. -Senior staff officer. -Yes? It's over. 5:00 am - Signal from flagship. Position: 450 miles west of Midway. Direction: West. Speed: 24 knots. Battle order number 5. Admiral! How can we so shamefully retreat? The Hiryu has not sunk. We'll have to sink the Hiryu with our own torpedoes. If we do this ... ...the Emperor. How can we apologize to the Emperor? Leave that to me. I am the only one who must apologize to His Majesty. So ended the battle of Midway. Any hope for a negotiated resolution of the conflict, nutured in the mind in chief Yamamoto, was destroyed. The Americans began an offensive in the South Pacific, pushing Japan back bit-by-bit. The decisive battle was to take place in the vicinity of Guadalcanal. The situation there continued to degrade. The military power of both sides was almost equal. Our outer defense line suffered as more and more reinforcements were sent to break the stalemate. Admiral Yamamoto and his staff, with the aim of stopping the advance of the enemy and improve morale, went to Rabaul for inspections and consultations. Having sent his itenerary by coded message, he began his fateful flight. Rabaul Attention! Salute! At ease! I'm counting on you. Each of you. Salute! Attention! To your aircraft. To your aircraft! So...work progressing okay? Yes, sir! The plane will be ready the day after tomorrow. -Works well? -Yes, sir! -I'm counting on you. -Yes sir! As mentioned earlier, the current rate of production of military aircraft is poor. I apologize with regard to the inadequate number we've been able to provide you. Without enough aircraft, we cannot win this war. Do not speak so selfishly. In the Combined Fleet, there are a total of about 300 naval aircraft. This base has fewer aircraft now than at start of the war. Does Headquarters and the Cabinet have the will to win this war? Don't you feel at least some responsibility? Staff of the military base at Rabaul During this year, death took countless friends. Tomorrow, I take command of the third group. We will avenge the enemy for today's battle. Everyone... Yes, sir. Message. Good. Got it. Fighters from Guadalcanal intercepted our air raid. Again? Did the Americans have advanced radar, or did they listen in to our communications? That we do not know. But every day, 30 minutes before our raids were to arrive, the Americans are ready and waiting for our planes. Our men are caught in a snare set by the Americans. Everyday... Returning aircraft. One ... two ... There they are, there they are. The differences between our and their military power becoming more and more apparent. Soon, their advantage will be insurmountable. I have 100 days of life remaining. During this period, I will try to work hard. I am a man who is orderin himself to die. I am ready to lose my life. Orders must be obeyed. The Admiral is checking the last unit now. His inspections here are complete. He leaves tomorrow at 6 am. Having completed his review of all units in the south-eastern area, he returns to the "Yamato" at the island of Truk. Completed his review? This is not some routine check. This is a last goodbye. Yes. The remaining units prefer to die with honor. The Admiral, as their commander, wants to look everyone in the eye. Or maybe ... he wants everyone to look into his eyes. Salute. Attention! Salute the commander! Yamamoto's itenerary was obtained by the Americans who decoded the encrypted messages. Directly the Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox in Washington, the attack order was given to fighter squadrons on Guadalcanal. "Message from Washington to Henderson Field, Guadalcanal:" "Admiral Yamamoto and his Chief-of-Staff, 7 Admirals," "will leave Rabaul at 6 am and head to the base on the island of Bougainville." "The Admiral and his staff will be on two bombers escorted by six Zero fighters." "According to the schedule, his arrival is to be at 0745." "Direct P-38s of the 339th Fighter Squadron to find and destroy." "Admiral Yamamoto is known to be punctual." "The President considers this an extremely important operation. Report results immediately to Washington." My position, personally, is in complete opposition to the general opinion, and so I must express my beliefs here. I find myself in a very strange position. Perhaps this too is part of my fate? Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet was killed during military operations April 18, 1943 at 7:40 am in the skies over the island of Bougainville in the Solomon Islands. Many hundreds of thousands of people who fought deperately for a country have not returned. What has this war brought us? Nothing but destruction. The End
