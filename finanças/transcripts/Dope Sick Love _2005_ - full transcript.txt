( traffic passing ) FUCKING SHIT! - YEAH, YOU LIKE UNCIRCUMCISED GUYS, RIGHT? - YEAH. YOU'RE THE BEST, MAN. 80, 100, 20, 40, 60. NO, COME HERE, MOTHERFUCKER, WE'RE TAKING A-- GOD, GIVE ME 24 HOURS AWAY FROM THIS MADNESS. TALK TO YOU. ( toilet flushes ) I'M FILLING OUT THIS WESTERN UNION SLIP TO RECEIVE MONEY FROM MY FATHER AND... GET MATT AND I'S DAY STARTED. A LOT OF TIMES, MATT NEEDS A BOOST TO START THE DAY. $100! LET'S GO. LET'S GO, JEEVES. MY BAGS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HA-HA WHOA! NOW, I'VE ALREADY CALLED THE CRACK DEALER AND THE DOPE DEALER. WE'RE GOING TO 15TH AND 6TH TO MEET THE CRACK DEALER, THEN WE'RE GOING TO HORATIO AND WASHINGTON MEET THE DOPE DEALER. THEN WE'RE GOING TO THE SPOT TO SHOOT THE DOPE, SMOKE THE CRACK, FUCK SOME PUSSY, EAT SOME DICK. GET A HOTEL ROOM. ( growls ) - I'M ABOUT TO TEAR THAT ASS UP, GIRL. - DO THAT AGAIN. - I'M ABOUT TO TEAR THAT ASS UP, GIRL. - MEOW! MONDAY HE SENT HER 500. TUESDAY HE SENT HER 300. AY AND ( IS ONLY WEDNESDAY. SHE'S ALMOST GOING ON $1,000 ALREADY. SHE'S GONNA PICK LOCK THE DOOR, SEE IF SHE CAN GET IN SO WE CAN GO IN THERE AND GET HIGH. THIS IS FOR YOU. ( whispering ) FUCKING IN. I GOT INTRODUCED TO HEROIN WHEN I WAS 17 IN HIGH SCHOOL, PRIVATE SCHOOL I WENT TO, RENEAUX ACADEMY, MY SENIOR YEAR. BUT I SNIFFED IT TILL I MET MATT, ENTIRELY CONFIDENT I COULD GO BACK TO JUST SNIFFING IT. THE DIFFERENCE IS JUST THE RUSH. YOU'RE READY TO WALK OUT OF HERE? HUH-- COME ON. WE HAVE TO GET SOMEBODY TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR US. IT'S USUALLY MUCH EASIER THAN THIS. WE'VE NEVER HAD THAT MUCH PROBLEM. - NO, OKAY. - ( door buzzes open ) THANKS. Man on intercom: You've got the wrong apartment. OKAY. - MICHELLE. - YES. CAN I USE YOUR LIGHTER, BUDDY? I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID WITH MINE. - THIS IS THE ONE YOU GAVE ME. - OKAY. - ARE YOU OKAY, SEBASTIAN? - YEAH. - HERE YOU GO. - COOL, THANK YOU. I WORRY ABOUT SEBASTIAN SHOOTING THE CRACK, BECAUSE WHAT HE'S DOING IS A LOT MORE INTENSE THAN SMOKING IT-- AS YOU CAN SEE. NOW-- NOW WATCH HIM. HE'LL START TO GET VERY NERVOUS IN A FEW MINUTES. - YOU OKAY, SEBASTIAN? - YEAH. - NO BLOOD ON ME ANYWHERE? - NO BLOOD. ALL RIGHT. Sebastian: OKAY. HELLO. WHAT I DO IS, UH-- I TALK WITH MEN-- SEE, THEY-- THEY-- WHERE WE'RE GOING IS WHERE THEY PICK UP GIRLS, ST. MARKS PLACE. IT'S A HOTEL. CRACKHEAD GIRLS HANG OUT THERE. DRUG ADDICTS HANG OUT THERE AND MEN COME TO PICK UP DATES THERE. THESE GIRLS SETTLE FOR NOTHING. IF YOU TELL THEM A HIT OF CRACK, THEY'LL SUCK YOUR DICK. I HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE I NAME A HIGH PRICE FOR BASICALLY NOTHING, 'CAUSE I'M TRYING TO ROB YOUR MONEY ANYWAY. I-- I HATE IT, 'CAUSE I KNOW, SO YOU KNOW SOMETIMES SHE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT AND SOMETIMES SHE HAS TO DO SOMETHING FOR IT. AND SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND AND I DON'T LIKE OTHER GUYS PUTTING THEIR HANDS ON HER. WE THINK I'M TRYING TO DO THIS TO GET US OFF THE STREETS. IN OUR BRAIN, WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE WE'RE DRUG ADDICTS AND WE'RE DREAMERS. BECAUSE EVERY DIME IS GOING ON DRUGS. IT REALLY IS. I MEAN I'VE BEEN ON THE STREETS ABOUT NINE DAYS NOW. I'D SAY I MADE ABOUT $1,200. I DON'T-- I DON'T EVEN HAVE MONEY FOR CIGARETTES RIGHT NOW. AND IT REALLY, REALLY SUCKS. - YOU'RE COMING DOWN OFF THAT STUFF, RIGHT, HON? - YEAH. - SO IF YOU HEAR MY WHISTLE-- - YEAH. TRYING TO MAKE YOUR MONEY OUT HERE? I HEAR YOU. YEAH. IS THAT YOUR MAN ACROSS THE STREET WATCHING YOU? Michelle: A COUPLE OF PEOPLE MAKE SURE I'M OKAY. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. NOW IF WE DO ANYTHING ELSE BUT SMOKE, IS IT GOING TO COST ME? YEAH, IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO PAY ME IN CRACK, THAT'S NOT HOW I LIKE TO GET PAID. NO, EXCUSE ME, I'M TALKING STRAIGHT UP. YEAH, I NEED TO MAKE CASH. I UNDERSTAND THAT. I'M TALKING STRAIGHT UP, OKAY? Sebastian: YEAH, MICHELLE GOT IN THE CAR WITH HER JOHN. I JUST HOPE THAT SHE DOESN'T-- SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING YOU KNOW, SEXUAL. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED WAS-- I KEPT ASKING HIM, WELL, WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT? AND HE WAS LIKE, "WELL I LIKE 69. I LIKE BLOW JOBS. I WANT SEX." - BUT HE DIDN'T GIVE ME NO MONEY YET, BABE. - RIGHT. - SO NOW I CAN'T DO NOTHING. I GOT NO MONEY. - RIGHT. WHAT AM I GONNA SAY? ALL RIGHT, YOU LIKE ALL THAT, THAT'S NICE. SO THEN FINALLY I SAID, "HOW MUCH AM I GONNA GET PAID FOR THIS?" HE SAID, "I'LL GIVE YOU 100." I SAID, "SURE, OKAY." I SAID, "AREN'T YOU GOING TO GIVE ME THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE HOTEL? 'CAUSE I CAN GET IT CHEAPER, 'CAUSE I KNOW THE GUY." HE HANDED ME THE $40 AND THAT'S WHEN I SAID, "YOU JUST HANDED YOUR MONEY TO AN UNDERCOVER COP." HE SAID, "OKAY, ALL RIGHT." I SAID, "PULL OVER RIGHT NOW. PULL THE FUCK OVER." I SPENT 40 ON CRACK, I SPENT 18 ON CIGARETTES, I SPENT 10 IN THE DELI. 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 20, 40, 60. - SO 160 AND-- - 220, 220. WE MADE 220 ON THAT. MONEY THAT COMES THAT WAY, YOU CANNOT HOLD ONTO IT. IT JUST SLIPS OUT OF YOUR FINGERS AND GOES, YOU KNOW, IT WALKS INTO THE FUCKING CRACK SPOT BY ITSELF. YOU KNOW, THE BASEMENT IS ACTUALLY COOL TOO. YOU WANNA GO TO THE TOP OR THE BASEMENT? ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I HAVE MY PIPE STASHED IN MY POCKET BETWEEN MY BUTT CHEEKS, NOT IN MY BUTT. THAT'S RESERVED FOR THE TRICKS. Tracy: I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM AT FIRST SIGHT. HE DIDN'T LIKE ME WHEN WE FIRST MET. HE TOLD EVERYBODY AROUND THE PARK TO AVOID ME, THAT I'M TROUBLE, THAT I'M DADDY'S LITTLE RICH GIRL. YEAH, THAT I RUN AROUND WITH DADDY'S MONEY. - THAT I'M NOT A REAL DRUG ADDICT, I'M A FAKE. - ( both chuckle ) IF I'M DADDY'S RICH GIRL, THEN HE'S EVERY HOMO'S LITTLE FUCKING BOY TOY OUT HERE. ( chuckles ) MATT IS TRYING TO LOOK LONELY AND PATHETIC. THAT'S WHEN THE TRICKS APPROACH HIM. THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GETTING-- STRAIGHT GUYS THAT ARE OUT HERE TRYING TO MAKE MONEY. IT'S AMAZING. YOU WILL SEE GUYS COME OUT HERE, THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, MEET ONE OF THESE HUSTLERS. THE HUSTLERS WILL GET THEM SMOKING CRACK. THREE DAYS LATER YOU'LL SEE THESE GUYS ON THE PARK BENCH DEAD BROKE, CAN'T GET HOME. I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA HAVE TOO MUCH SUCCESS ON THE STREET ITSELF. I THINK CALLS WILL BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THING. MATT, WHY DON'T YOU TRY A PHONE? HEY, BABY, WHAT'S UP? IT'S MATTHEW CALLING TO GET MY WEEKLY BUTT WASHING. I'M IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARTYING, GETTING IT ON, SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD DO IT A LITTLE SAFE AND HAVE SOME FUN. ALL RIGHT. I'M FEELING YOUNG. BYE. - THAT'S GOOD. I SAID THAT'S GOOD. - OH, THAT'S GOOD? YOU'RE THE BEST, MAN. WE HAVE A GOOD TIME TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT, GOTTA GO. - OKAY. - TALK TO YOU. THANKS A LOT, SCOTT. - OKAY, HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. - BYE, BYE. TRACY AIN'T FROM THIS WORLD, YOU KNOW? THIS IS ALL NEW TO HER. I MEAN SHE'S NEVER EVEN SEEN THIS SIDE OF LIFE UNTIL SHE MET ME A YEAR AGO. SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT HE'S EXERTING SO MUCH EFFORT AND ENERGY INTO ENTICING AND LANDING THESE TRICKS THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT FOR ME, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, IT'S THE SAME THING ABOUT SEX. I ALWAYS FEEL THAT SEXUALLY, THAT'S WHAT HE DOES FOR A LIVING. SO IT'S THE LAST THING HE REALLY WANTS TO EVEN, YOU KNOW, UH, ADDRESS OR DEAL WITH WHEN HE'S WITH ME. YOU CAN GET TRAPPED AND CAUGHT UP IN THIS LIFESTYLE. AND ONCE YOU CROSS A CERTAIN BOUNDARY, IT'S LIKE THERE'S NO TURNING BACK, YOU KNOW? THIS IS THE ONLY LIFE I KNOW. I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE I WAS 14. I WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS 12 THAT WIPED OUT ANY MEMORY I HAVE OF MY CHILDHOOD. SO I ONLY REMEMBER AS FAR AS 12 YEARS AND OLDER. AND SINCE I'M 12, I WAS SCALPING TICKETS TO THE GARDEN. 13, YOU KNOW, STARTED MOVING DOWNTOWN WITH THE CONS AND THE-- THE HUSTLES IN PENN STATION SWEET-TALKING PEOPLE OUT OF MONEY, ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO GREENWICH VILLAGE HUSTLING HOMOS. YOU KNOW, SO I'VE BEEN HERE ALL MY LIFE. THIS HAS BEEN EVERYTHING I KNOW. Sebastian: SO COLIN, MY FRIEND, WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOU? YOU LIKE UNCIRCUMCISED GUYS AS I RECALL, RIGHT? YEAH. YEAH, I LIKE REDHEADS. - REDHEADS? - YEAH. I'M CLOSE TO IT, BLOND. SO WHY DON'T WE HANG OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT? I DON'T KNOW. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT? - HOW MUCH CAN YOU GIVE ME? - 20. 30? - OKAY. - COME ON. Colin: YOU HAVE TO CALL BEFORE YOU COME OVER. Sebastian: I NEVER COME UNINVITED. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. HE'S SUCKING MY DICK AND I'M THINKING ABOUT WHAT AM I GONNA DO AS SOON AS I GET THE MONEY, YOU KNOW. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I'M ABLE TO-- TO FOCUS I GUESS AND-- AND DO WHAT I GOTTA DO BECAUSE... I KIND OF LIKE PUT MYSELF OUT OF THERE. I'M NOT-- I'M THERE, BUT I'M REALLY-- MENTALLY I TRY TO LIKE BE SOMEWHERE ELSE. THIS IS WHY OUR RELATIONSHIP SUCKS, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE. WE'RE-- WE'RE RUNNING PARTNERS, YOU KNOW? AND IT'S LIKE, I'M VERY GOOD TO SEBASTIAN, EVEN THOUGH I'M POISONING HIM. CAN I COME DOWN, BABE? WHEN WE FIRST MET, WE DIDN'T GET HIGH TOGETHER AT ALL. AND WE ALWAYS USED TO SAY, WHEN WE GET HIGH TOGETHER IT'S OVER. MY HUSBAND OVERDOSED AND DIED AND MY BOYFRIEND OVERDOSED AND DIED. I'VE OVERDOSED PLENTY OF TIMES. ( chuckles ) I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD SURVIVE A THIRD. ( crowd chatting ) ( door slams ) I'M SPENDING THE DAY AT MY MA'S HOUSE. I WON'T DO DRUGS AROUND MY MOTHER. I THINK IT WOULD KILL HER IF SHE KNEW I WAS SHOOTING HEROIN. Ma WE CAN TAKE THIS ONE. I HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN THIS WAY IN YEARS. IT'S A BURNT OUT FUCKING NIGGER TOWN. THE GHETTO, THE SLUMS. BUT MY MOM'S BLOCK IS PROBABLY THE ONLY BLOCK-- FUCKING WHITE BLOCK IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND THAT'S CHANGED. I THINK SHE'S THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY NOW. BUT I GREW UP HERE. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. THIS IS WESTSIDE CEMETERY. I USED TO SMOKE DUST IN THERE WHEN I WAS LIKE 11 YEARS OLD. ( bell rings ) IT'LL BE OKAY, COME ON. THIS WAS THE FIRST HOUSE MY MOM MOVED INTO WHEN SHE MOVED TO THIS BLOCK. ALL THE WORK, THE ALUMINUM SIDING AND EVERYTHING, MY FATHER DID EVERYTHING. HE HAD A HEART ATTACK A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. HE DIED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. YOU KNOW I GOT LOVE FOR YOU. YOU BETTER HAVE MONEY FOR ME. THIS IS MY MOM, DOROTHY CALHOUN. THIS IS HER DREAM. SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED A HOUSE. SHE GOT ONE ON THE SAME BLOCK SHE CAN'T SEEM TO GET OFF OF FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. I'M HERE FOR AT LEAST 30 YEARS UNTIL THE HOUSE IS PAID OFF AT LEAST. Ma IT'S GOING TO BE THAT LONG? YEAH, BUT I'LL LEAVE THE BILLS FOR YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - I'M THROWING AWAY THAT OLD-- - NO, MATT, NOT HERE. MA, IT'S A CHEESECAKE THING. YOU DON'T NEED THAT. MATTHEW, THIS IS RECYCLING. THIS IS MAIL TO GO IN THE MAILBOX, THANK YOU. SOME COCOA PEBBLES, I LOVE IT. SHE STILL KEEPS THE BEST CEREAL. OW! DON'T CRY OVER SPILT MILK. THERE'S MATTHEW TOO. HEY, MATTHEW. I WAS TWO YEARS OLD THERE, 1976. HE WAS A GOOD CHILD. HE WAS AN A-NUMBER-ONE BABY. - WHO ME? - YEP, YOU WERE. AND THEN YOU GREW UP. ( chuckles ) - LOOK AT ANDREW. - WHO'S THIS? THIS IS ME AND MY SON AT MY GRANDMOTHER'S. I WAS SEEING HIM EVERY WEEKEND THEN. MY LITTLE MAN. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN LIKE NINE MONTHS. - ( music box playing ) - I CAN'T-- I CAN'T DEAL WITH ANY OF IT ANYMORE. - HUH? - I SAID I CAN'T DEAL WITH YOUR ROUGH LIFE ANYMORE. - YOU KNOW SOMETHING, MA? - I LIVED WITH IT FOR TOO LONG. YOU KNOW WHAT, MA? I ALMOST CAN'T DEAL WITH IT ANYMORE. I'M GETTING TIRED OF IT. - GO HOME, GO HOME, GO HOME. - ALL RIGHT. - I LOVE YOU, MA. - I LOVE YOU TOO. GO. I'LL TALK TO YOU IN A WEEK. - LOVE YOU. - LOVE YOU TOO. BE GOOD. YEAH, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO FUCKING HELL. ( Matt sniffing ) THAT WAS SO NORMAL. - WE HAVE TO-- BABE, BABE, BABE-- - WE GOT TO GET DOPE. - WE GOT NO MONEY. - IF YOU CALL YOUR FATHER AND YOUR FATHER GUARANTEES YOU TOMORROW WE'LL GO RIGHT TO TERRY'S. SHE DOES NOTHING FOR HIM, SHE BRINGS HIM DOWN. HE BRINGS HER DOWN, SHE BRINGS HIM DOWN, WHICHEVER. YOU KNOW, THEY DO NOTHING FOR EACH OTHER. OH MY GOD, BABY. THAT GETS ME NERVOUS. IF SHE YOUR GIRL, WHY THE FUCK IS SHE FUCKING EVERY PIPEHEAD OUT HERE? WHY THE FUCK SHE INVITING ME TO SOME APARTMENT UP IN FUCKING HARLEM? - MAYBE SHE WAS HORNY THAT DAY. - GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE. - SHIT HAPPENS, YOU KNOW. - YEAH, AND THAT'S YOUR GIRL? - AND THAT'S YOUR GIRL? - THAT'S MY GIRL! I'M TELLING YOU IT'S MY GIRL. IN MY HEART IT'S MY GIRL. YOU ABOUT TO TURN ON ME. YOU A FAKE MOTHERFUCKER. I'LL FUCK THAT BITCH UP RIGHT NOW. - NO YOU WON'T. - NO I WON'T? - I'M TELLING YOU YOU WON'T. - WHAT? - I'M TELLING YOU. - YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING TOO? I'M TELLING YOU YOU WON'T, SHAWN. - WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? - I'M TELLING YOU. - WHAT YOU WANT TO DO NOW? - YOU WANT TO FIGHT WITH ME? YOU'RE TURNING ON YOUR BROTHER? - IF YOU'RE GONNA TURN ON ME, THEN THAT SHIT IS DEAD. - IT'S DEAD THEN. - THEN IT'S DEAD. YOU A FAKE MOTHERFUCKER. - CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT. - A FAKE MOTHERFUCKER. - CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT. BUT WHEN YOUR BITCH COMES UP MISSING, COME AND SEE ME. WHEN SHE COMES UP MISSING, COME AND SEE ME. HIS BROTHER'S RARELY THERE, IF EVER, TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING POSITIVE OR BENEFICIAL TO MATT'S LIFE. YET AT THE SAME TIME, HE CARES SO DEEPLY ABOUT MATT AND IS SO, YOU KNOW, WORRIED ABOUT MATT'S LIFE AND MATT'S WELL-BEING THAT HE'S TRYING TO PROTECT MATT FROM BEING WITH ME, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOOD FOR MATT. I'LL JUST WRITE HIM OFF. JUST LIKE THAT. Shawn: THE FIGHT BETWEEN ME AND MY BROTHER IS ACTUALLY THE FIGHT BETWEEN HIM AND THEM DRUGS THAT HE'S DOING. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO KILL HIM. IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S LIVING A SUICIDAL MISSION. THIS IS NOT THE SAME DRUG. FUCK, MAN. ( car honks ) THE GARBAGE IS EMPTY AND THOSE ARE PROBABLY FUCKING SOPPING WET, BABE. SEBASTIAN IS LOOKING THROUGH THE GARBAGE FOR RECEIPTS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY AND WE WANT TO GET SOME DRUGS. SO HE'S GONNA GET RECEIPTS AND WE'RE GOING TO THE STORE AND RETURN THE MERCHANDISE. SOMETIMES HE HAS TO GO THROUGH THREE OR FOUR BAGS OF GARBAGE BEFORE HE CAN FIND A RECEIPT. IT'S KIND OF JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SCAM, YOU KNOW? SOME DAYS WORK OUT SMOOTH, SOME DON'T. HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO, SEBASTIAN. GOOD EVENING. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. I BOUGHT SOMETHING IN YOUR STORE. IS IT POSSIBLE I CAN RETURN IT IN A DIFFERENT D'AGOSTINO? THANK YOU, SIR. WHOO! ARE YOU LOOKING, SEBASTIAN? YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO GET CAUGHT. HERE, HERE WE GO. HOLD THIS. JUST HOLD IT. ( register beeps ) UH, I'M RETURNING THIS. MY MOTHER-IN-LAW JUST CALLED THE STORE A FEW MINUTES AGO. I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE SPOKE TO. - LET ME SEE THIS. - HERE YOU GO. LEWIS, SHE WENT TO GREENWICH. SHE'S RETURNING THIS. SHE JUST CALLED THE STORE. SHE SAID SHE SPOKE TO A WOMAN. SO YOU DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE TOOK THAT CALL... THAT SHE SPOKE TO A WOMAN? - NO. - NO, HUH? THAT FIGURES. OKAY. THAT'S BULLSHIT. I MEAN WHAT THE FUCK, SEBASTIAN? YOU DID NOT CALL THAT STORE. YOU CALLED THE STORE ON THAT RECEIPT. YES, I DID. NO WONDER WHY. THAT IS NOT THE STORE THAT'S ON THE RECEIPT. I DIDN'T HAVE THAT NUMBER. SO YOU JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT AND SEND ME IN SOMEWHERE WITH FUCKED UP INFORMATION, RIGHT? I NEVER TOLD YOU. WELL, THAT'S HOW I TOOK IT, SEBASTIAN. YOU KNOW, COMMON SENSE-- I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD CALL THE STORE THAT I'M GOING INTO. YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'M NOT FUCKING NORMAL, BUT THAT'S WHAT I WOULD THINK THAT YOU WERE DOING, NOT CALLING A DIFFERENT STORE AND THEN SENDING ME INTO THE STORE THAT YOU DIDN'T CALL. SO THIS IS MY FAULT AND THEN I ROB THE STORE. THAT WAS EVEN BETTER. AND THEN I ROB THE FUCKING STORE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND I COULD GO TO FUCKING JAIL FOR A YEAR FOR A FUCKING BOTTLE OF TIDE? WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO FOR MONEY, SEBASTIAN? I DON'T WANT TO PICK IN FUCKING GARBAGE, MAN. FUCKING DISGUSTING. OH, OH, FUCK. - SEBASTIAN, I GOT A FRAME FOR $14.99. - WHAT IS IT? JUST A PICTURE FRAME. 4X6, THAT'S SMALL, RIGHT? - $14.99. - HOLY SHIT, HELL YEAH. ( Muzak playing ) GOT IT. OH, I'M SORRY. I THINK SO, 'CAUSE I TOOK THE CALL. THE GUY WHO RETURNED A PHONE, HE WAS LIKE, "IT DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT." I SAID, "THE PHONE WAS NEVER OPENED." THANK YOU. DID YOU MAGICALLY USE THIS BOX? HE JUST LEFT. OKAY. I THINK I GOT 15. I GOT BULLSHIT. THIS IS NOTHING. LOOK, MY FEET HURT. I NEED DOPE. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, SEBASTIAN? 'CAUSE I NEED LIKE PILES OF MONEY, FORGET THIS SHIT. BUT A HIT OF CRACK WILL DO FOR NOW. BABE, LISTEN, WE GOT TO GO OVER TO ST. MARKS AND MAKE MONEY. I'M GOING TO USE THE BADGE TONIGHT, THE NYPD MONEY CLIP THAT LOOKS LIKE THE BADGE I GOT FROM THAT JOHN. - YEAH. - SO I CAN PRETEND THAT I'M A DETECTIVE. I'LL JUST FLASH IT IN FRONT OF THEM REAL QUICK, ALL RIGHT? IF THEY'RE INTIMIDATED AND SCARED, THEN I KNOW IT'S GONNA WORK. IF NOT, THEN I GET OUT WITH WHATEVER I GOT. - ( door squeaks ) - ARE YOU A COP? - Man: NO, ARE YOU? - OH, NO. Man: I TOUCH YOU, YOU TOUCH ME. THAT'S SO SILLY. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - ED. YOU ARE? - CATHY. CATHY. WELL, I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, OKAY? - YOU JUST HANDED YOUR MONEY TO AN UNDERCOVER COP. - OH. - YOU WANT TO TRY AND MAKE A DEAL? - YEAH. - DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY AND GET YOU OUT OF THIS? - YEAH, YEAH. PARK THE FUCKING TRUCK. NOW I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, 30 GUYS WENT ALREADY TONIGHT. 30 ARE IN JAIL. THREE GOT LET GO. - SHUT YOUR TRUCK OFF. - ( lock buzzes ) WHOA, WHY ARE YOU DOING IT LIKE THAT? I'M SCARED NOW. YOU MADE ME ALL NERVOUS. - NO, CALM DOWN. - WELL, LET ME-- HANG ON A SECOND. OH, NO, NO, NO, LET GO. DON'T DO THAT, LET-- - HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING MY KEYS? - HEY, CLOSE THAT DOOR. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY KEYS? STOP IT! NOW YOU'RE GETTING ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT. - WHY ARE YOU TAKING MY KEYS? - I'M NOT. GET BACK IN THE TRUCK. YOU'RE GETTING ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT NOW. THAT'S THE OTHER DETECTIVE. - ( car alarm blaring ) - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. MY SERGEANT-- MY SERGEANT WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. COME ON. COME ON, COME ON. ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA LET YOU TALK TO MY SERGEANT. - LET ME SEE CREDENTIALS. - HE'S GETTING IT EXPLAINED TO HIM. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. OKAY, THAT'S FINE. COME ON, MY SERGEANT WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. - GO AHEAD, YEAH. - I CAN WALK? GO AHEAD, I'M NOT CUFFING HIM. GO AHEAD, HE'S NOT CUFFING YOU. WAIT, WAIT, I'M REALLY SCARED NOW. STOP IT. HE'S NOT CUFFING YOU. I JUST TOLD HIM YOU'RE FREE TO GO. DO YOU HEAR ME? I SENT HIM AWAY. COME ON. ( Michelle laughing ) GO AHEAD, MOTHERFUCKER. BUNNY, WHERE ARE YOU? HE HURT MY HAND REALLY BAD. ALL I GOT IS 20 BUCKS, SEBASTIAN. HE GOT TOO SCARED. HE GOT TOO SCARED. DON'T EVER-- DON'T DO THAT. WHAT YOU DID, DON'T DO THAT NO MORE. - IF I NEED HELP, I WILL SAY HELP ME. - OKAY. YOU SCARED THE LIVING FUCK OUT OF THAT KID, MAN. LOOK AT YOU AND LOOK AT ME, WE DEFINITELY DON'T LOOK LIKE COPS. BUT HE FUCKING HURT MY HAND THOUGH, MAN. I HAD HIS KEYS. HE FUCKING-- BOTH MY FINGERS WERE IN HIS KEY RING. I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DYE MY HAIR DURING THE WEEK-- BLACK. I MAY HAVE TO DYE MY HAIR BLACK FOR A WHILE, SEBASTIAN, IF THIS STARTS TO GET TOO WILD AND THEY START LOOKING FOR A BLONDE. Michelle: I'M MEETING A GUY IN A GREEN MAXIMA, GETTING INTO THIS CAR RIGHT HERE AND I'M GOING TO RUN MY SCAM ON HIM. ( Michelle laughing ) HI, HOW ARE YOU? Man: I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING TO ME SO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A COP. - WHAT? - TAKE OUT YOUR TIT OR SOMETHING. - TAKE OUT MY TIT? - YEAH. WAIT, I GOT TOO MANY SHIRTS ON. WHERE WE OFF TO? UH, PARKING LOT. COME HERE. OH, YOU CAN'T KISS ME. YOU'RE GONNA CATCH MY COLD. I HOPE YOU DON'T KISS EVERYONE YOU MEET. - NO, I DON'T. - YOU'LL END UP GETTING SORES ON YOUR MOUTH. SO YOU JUST WANT WHAT? BLOW JOBS? - YEAH. - OKAY. SWEAR TO ME YOU'RE NOT A COP. - I'M NOT A COP. - YOU'RE NOT A COP? - I'M NOT A COP. - OKAY. - WHAT DO YOU GET, BY THE WAY? - WHY, WHAT ARE YOU GIVING? - 20. - THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED. - ( paper crinkles ) - THIS 20 REAL?

WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? - WANT A DEAL OR YOU WANT TO GO TO JAIL? - I WANT A DEAL. OKAY, WE'RE BUILDING A REHAB AND A SHELTER. YOU WANT TO MAKE A DONATION TO THAT INSTEAD OF GOING TO JAIL AND PAYING $5,000? - YES. - HOW MUCH CAN YOU DONATE? ALL THAT I GOT IN MY WALLET-- ABOUT 20. - NO, NO. - HOW MUCH? HUNDREDS, THEY'RE SPENDING HUNDREDS, THEY'RE-- HONEY, THIS IS ALL I GOT. I MEAN, NOT HONEY. EXCUSE ME, OFFICER. THIS IS WHAT I GOT IN MY WALLET. YOU HAVE AT LEAST-- WHAT DO YOU HAVE? SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN. ( man sighing ) 60, WAIT, 75, 77 AND THAT'S 97. - PAY THE 100-- OKAY. - OKAY? I'LL PUT IT IN THE OTHER. YOU PROMISE TO NEVER-- PROMISE TO NEVER COME BACK HERE. - NEVER? - NEVER COME BACK ON 11TH AND 12TH STREET, NEVER. YOU CAN PULL OUT. NO ONE IS GOING TO ARREST YOU. - YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME IN COURT. - NO, I DON'T. YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE SOMEONE THAT BELONGS THERE. IT WAS STUPID OF ME TO EVEN BE HERE. STUPID FOR A LOT OF REASONS. Michelle: OKAY. BUT IT'S VERY NICE OF YOU, $100 OR NOT, TO GIVE ME THAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS THE LAST TIME YOU'LL BE ON THIS STREET, RIGHT? YEAH, YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. - GONNA GO STRAIGHT HOME NOW, RIGHT? - YEAH. - I GOT YOUR WORD, RIGHT? - YES. GOODBYE. DON'T LOOK BACK. DRIVE STRAIGHT OUT. GIVE ME MY SNAPPLE BOTTLE. BEHAVE.

THEN, JUST TO STARTLE HIM A LITTLE BIT, I PULLED OUT MY CUFFS. I SAID, "I DON'T HAVE TO CUFF YOU? DO I HAVE TO CUFF YOU OR CAN I TRUST YOU TO SIT HERE?" THESE WORK, GOOD IDEA. AND HE FELL RIGHT INTO THE PALM. BETTER COVER YOUR EARS, I'VE GOT TO WHISTLE FOR SEBASTIAN NOW. ( Michelle whistles ) AND THIS IS THE PART THAT FUCKS UP, WHEN SEBASTIAN'S NOT WHERE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE. 'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK FOR HIM. - ALL HE HAD WAS 100 ON HIM. I DIDN'T GO FURTHER. - ALL RIGHT. I JUST TOOK THE 100, 'CAUSE I'M NOT REALLY FEELING WELL. - SO I MADE 97 OFF HIM. - OKAY. - YOU WERE NERVOUS, RIGHT? - YEAH. WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING OVER HERE? I'M RUNNING BACK TO 12TH STREET, BACK HERE. TO ST. MARKS, BACK TO 12TH STREET, BACK HERE. COME ON, I WANT A FRAPPUCCINO. HMM, YEAH SHE MADE $100, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST TOO LONG. YOU KNOW, MOST OF IT IS GONE ALREADY. 'CAUSE EVERY TIME WE LIGHT THIS THING UP, IT'S FUCKING $10 OR MORE. THIS IS WHAT DRUGS IS DOING TO ME. I'M 120 LBS. I'M NOTHING. SOMETIMES I-- I DON'T KNOW IF I'M BETTER OFF DEAD. I WAS SENTENCED TO 30 DAYS IN RIKERS ISLAND FOR ASSAULT AND I'LL END UP SPENDING 18 DAYS IN HERE. IT'S MISERABLE. MISERABLE, BUT CALMING IN THE SAME WAY. BUT MISERABLE, 'CAUSE I'M AWAY FROM MATT. SO REALLY THAT MISERY OVERRIDES EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW, WITHOUT MY MAN I'M TERRIBLE. WHAT'S UP, COZ? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHO'S THAT? I'M JUST WRITING A LETTER. - WHO? - ME. - TO WHO? - TO MY GIRL. OH, WHAT HER? GOOD SHIT. THAT'S GOOD SHIT, MAN. SHE'S GONNA BE HAPPIER THAN A PIG IN SHIT, COZ. ( chuckles ) - YOU'RE MISSING HER, AIN'T YOU? - YEAH. BIG TIME. WRITE IT ALL IN THERE, BRO. GET IT OUT, YOU HEAR ME? GET IT OUT, MATT. LET THAT SHIT RIDE IN THE WORDS. GET HER OPEN. I KNOW YOU GOT IT IN YOU. "TO TRACY, HEY MAMA GIRL. IT'S BEEN TOO LONG SINCE I'VE HEARD YOUR VOICE OR HELD YOUR HAND. I CAN'T TAKE IT OUT HERE WITHOUT YOU. I MISS YOU SO MUCH THAT I COULDN'T EVEN SLEEP FOR THE FIRST SEVEN DAYS. YOU KNOW THAT SONG, 'YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TILL IT'S GONE'? WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED, BABY. I DON'T EVER WANT TO BE APART FROM YOU EVER AGAIN. AND I PROMISE YOU THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING MARRIED RIGHT AWAY. I PROMISE. ANYWAY, HOLD YOUR HEAD, BABY, AND KEEP ME IN YOUR PRAYERS. I LOVE YOU AND I'M STAYING STRONG. PLEASE, HURRY HOME, I NEED YOU. LOVE, MATT." IT SUCKS. I'M MISERABLE AND I'M SAD. I CAN'T FOCUS. I'M CONSTANTLY DOPE SICK. JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE SHE GOT ARRESTED, WE WERE ARGUING SO MUCH THAT I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, GOD, GIVE ME 24 HOURS AWAY FROM THIS MADNESS." I REGRET EVER SAYING THAT. YEAH. UH... I'M LOOKING FOR MY BAG OF DOPE. PLEASE, GOD, ANYTHING WITH DOPE. OH MY GOD, THE DOPE'S GONE. FUCK. GONE. ( Matt stomps ) I JUST FUCKING HAD IT. I DID-- I DID HAVE IT, RIGHT? THIS IS REAL SHIT. I LOST MY ONE AND ONLY FUCKING BAG OF DOPE. HOW DO YOU LOSE YOUR ONE AND ONLY FUCKING BAG? I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I JUST HAD IT THROUGH ALL THAT FUCKING RANTING AND RAVING ACT LIKE A FUCKING ASSHOLE. I LOST IT. NOW WE BACKTRACK. I LOST IT. IT'S GONE. IT'S LIKE A RECTANGLE WHITE BAG. YEAH, OW! HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW? FOUND IT! ( humming ) RIGHT THERE, BABY. PHEW!

I JUST-- IF I CRY ABOUT IT NOW, IT'S PREMATURE BECAUSE I STILL GOT, YOU KNOW, ANOTHER WEEK LEFT IN THIS PLACE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? BUT I'M HYPER AND I CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT. AND ALL DAY I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE WITH MATT. I JUST WANT TO BE WITH MATT. I KNOW MY BABY IS GONNA BE ALL RIGHT ONCE I'M OUT THERE. IF ANYBODY ASKS ME, I HAD TO WAIT IN LINE FOR THE BATHROOM. THAT'S WHY IT TOOK SO LONG. WHERE DID YOU GO NOW? I DON'T HAVE NO IDEA WHERE YOU WERE. - I TOLD YOU WHERE I WAS GOING. - WHERE WERE YOU GOING? I WAS FINISHING MY STASH. SO FULL OF SHIT. EVERYONE'S LYING TO ME, MAN. YOU MEAN YOU FINISHED SHOOTING YOUR CRACK, RIGHT? NO, THERE IS NO CRACK TO FUCKING SHOOT. YOU KNOW SOMETHING, SEBASTIAN-- FUCKING LYING PIECE OF SHIT-- TWICE YOU LEFT WITHOUT FUCKING TELLING ME NOTHING. YOU WON'T DISAPPEAR IF I'VE GOT TWO FUCKING HUNDRED BUCKS IN MY POCKET.

THAT'S NOT SO FUCKING GREAT, HUH? BUT I'M NOT DOING ANY OF THAT UNTIL YOU CALL AND GET ACCEPTED RIGHT NOW. YES, I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT IF I CAN GET IN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE LIKE TOMORROW MORNING. YES, IF I COULD. I CAN'T GO WITHOUT SEBASTIAN. FUCK THAT. OKAY, BYE. CALL BACK AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING TOMORROW. SURE THING. - YOU'LL GO IN, RIGHT?

ANY FUCKING SUGGESTIONS? OH MY GOD. ( moans ) FUCKING SHIT! GOD DAMN IT! ALL MY DOPE IS ALMOST GONE, SEBASTIAN. DID YOU SAVE ANY FOR ME? THE SAME FUCKING WORD GAME, OKAY? OKAY? GET OUT OF MY FUCKING WAY. MICHELLE. HANDS. - PUT YOUR FOOT IN HERE. - NO. PUT YOUR FOOT IN HERE. YOU'LL FREEZE. ( thunder rumbling ) I'M GOING TO SHOOT SOME CRYSTAL. FEEL ME. OH, SHE'S SCHIZZING, OH. OH, FUCK. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I EVER SHOT CRYSTAL METH. OH, WHEW. WHY AM I ON THE GROUND? YOU WANT TO STAND UP? SLOWLY. I CAN'T REALLY DO IT. MY LEGS ARE SLEEPING. OH GOSH, WHAT HAPPENED? ( shivering ) HOW COME I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, SEBASTIAN? ( shivering ) - WHERE'S THE TRAIN, SEBASTIAN? - RIGHT OVER HERE. HONEY, I CAN'T GO FAST. I'M SCARED. I'M NOT. I'M GONNA STAND RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. - ARE WE ALMOST THERE? - HMM. ( moaning ) OH, ARE WE ALMOST THERE?! ABOUT 10 MORE AND A COUPLE MORE AROUND THE CORNER. Conductor: 42nd, transfer above to shuttles 1, 2, 3 and 7. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I AM NOT ON MY WAY UP TO SEE MY FUCKING SON. Michelle: COLLECT CALL FROM MICHELLE, PLEASE. CAN YOU LIGHT THIS FOR ME, SEBASTIAN? OR ARE YOU BUSY? ANTHONY, WHAT TIME IS IT? IF I GET ON THE TRAIN RIGHT NOW, CAN YOU STAY THERE? 'CAUSE I CAN'T GO TO THE HOSPITAL WITHOUT ID AND I REALLY FUCKING NEED TO. CAN YOU JUST GO TO SCHOOL LATE? OKAY, SO THEN YOU'LL TAKE THE WHOLE FUCKING DAY OFF. I WILL GO TO THE SCHOOL AND TELL THEM YOU'RE WITH ME. HE'S SAYING THAT HE GETS OFF AT 12:00. WE'LL MEET HIM AT 12:00 THEN, IF HE CAN-- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CALL THE MOTHERFUCKING DETOX AT 8:00? WE'LL CALL THEM AT 8:00. THEY'LL HOLD THE BED TILL 5:00. YOU'RE SURE OF THIS, RIGHT? - I'M NOT POSITIVE, BUT-- - ( Michelle laughs ) BRING MY PURSE. DON'T FORGET MY PURSE. I LOVE YOU, ANTHONY. ( sobbing ) I REALLY GOT TO GO THERE. I REALLY GOT TO GO. I GOTTA GO INTO THAT DETOX. Michelle: WELL, WE'RE ALMOST UP IN NEW HAMBURG TO SEE ANTHONY. I'M REALLY NERVOUS. I'M SO NERVOUS ABOUT EVERYTHING. I WISH SEBASTIAN WAS WITH ME. THIS IS ANTHONY, MY SON. MY 17-YEAR-OLD. MY BEST FRIEND. HE'S MY SON FROM MY HUSBAND WHO PASSED AWAY. HIS FATHER WAS A DRUG ADDICT. HE OVERDOSED AT THE TIME I WASN'T HERE. I WAS IN FLORIDA PRISON. AND I COULDN'T BE WITH ANTHONY. AND... IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO WAS WITH HIM, HE JUST WANTED ME AND I COULDN'T BE HERE. BUT HE GOT HIS LITTLE SUIT ON AND WENT DOWN TO THE FUNERAL. HE GAVE HIS DAD A KISS GOODBYE. ( train whistle blowing ) HE WAS-- HE WAS CRUSHED. HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT, ANTHONY. I'VE ALWAYS HOPED SHE WOULD GET BETTER. I'M USED TO HER NOT GETTING BETTER THOUGH. LIKE SHE'LL COME UP FOR A WHILE AND LEAVE. IT DON'T AFFECT ME ANYMORE REALLY. I JUST DEAL WITH WHATEVER, YOU KNOW, I'VE TO GOT TO DEAL WITH. IF SHE GETS BETTER, I'M HAPPY, BUT IF SHE DON'T, LIKE I'M USED TO IT. THIS HAPPENED LOTS OF TIMES. OH, THAT PERSON'S LEAVING. I HOPE THAT'S NOT ANTHONY. THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET OUT OF THE CAR. THAT MIGHT BE ANTHONY. I GOT TO GET DOWN HERE IN CASE IT'S HIM. Michelle: I CAME UP TODAY TO GET MY ID - BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO INTO A DETOX. - YEAH. 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN IN THE STREETS FOR SIX MONTHS. BUT IN THE PAST WEEK IT'S BEEN THE WORST TIME OF MY FUCKING LIFE. I-- I JUST WANT TO GO IN THE HOSPITAL. Anthony: OKAY. Michelle: OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ANT. WELL, I'LL CALL YOU. YOU'RE GONNA CALL THE HOSPITAL AND WHATNOT AND CHECK ON ME, RIGHT? - YEAH. - THANKS FOR BRINGING-- GIVING ME MY ID. - Anthony: ALL RIGHT. - I LOVE YOU. - ( both kissing ) - LOVE YOU TOO. - I'LL CALL THE HOSPITAL LATER. - ALL RIGHT, HONEY. - BYE, ANT. - BYE. ( tires screeching ) OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OH HE'S-- OH GOD! WELL, I GOT THE ID AND MY POCKETBOOK FROM ANTHONY. AND I'M HEADING BACK DOWN TO THE CITY TO GO TO THE DETOX. HOPEFULLY I CAN FIND SEBASTIAN. ( sniffling ) Conductor: Grand Central Terminal, final stop. Have a good evening and a good weekend. HI, THIS IS MICHELLE BOSWELL CALLING. HI, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE COMING TONIGHT. UM, I WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL WHEN I ARRIVED AT GRAND CENTRAL. OKAY, BELLEVUE IS CLOSER. CAN I GO THERE? BECAUSE SEE, WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS I'M TRYING NOT TO STOP AND-- AND GET DETOURED. 'CAUSE I'M REALLY GETTING DOPE SICK RIGHT NOW. YEAH. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. OKAY, BYE-BYE. I'M SCARED. I DON'T HAVE MY BOYFRIEND WITH ME. HE'S SUPPOSED TO COME AND DO THIS WITH ME AND HE'S NOT. ( truck honking ) GOD, SEBASTIAN, PLEASE BE AT THIS DETOX. I JUST DON'T HAVE IT IN ME TO GO LOOK FOR HIM. I DON'T HAVE IT IN ME TO GO STEAL. I'M GETTING SICK. I JUST WANNA GO BE SAFE SOMEWHERE. ( sobs ) I'M SCARED. REALLY SCARED. BUT I DON'T WANT TO-- I DON'T WANT TO BE OUT HERE ANYMORE. I CAN'T DO IT NO MORE. DAD, CALL WHEN YOU GET YOUR PARKING SPOT IN NEW YORK. OKAY, BYE. YOU CAN TELL SHE GETS A LITTLE ANTSY. SHE WANTS EVERYTHING TO BE PERFECT, YOU KNOW? SHE FEARS THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN HER DAD SEES HER THAT HE'S GONNA SEE, YOU KNOW, THE HARD TIME SHE'S HAVING. - HOW WAS YOUR DRIVING? - DAD! - CRAZY AS USUAL, YOU KNOW. - HEY, DAD. - HI, TRACY. YOU DIDN'T DRINK THIS TIME, DID YOU? - NO. WE PUT SOME CHANGE IN THE METER 'CAUSE THE PARKING LADY-- DAD, WE HELD THIS SPOT FOR YOU FOR LIKE A HALF HOUR. OKAY, UH... - WHAT WE HAVE IS A-- - OH, WE'RE GOING TO BE TRIPLETS. WE GOT A BIRTHDAY JACKET FOR MATT BECAUSE IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY YESTERDAY. - THANKS A LOT. - THAT'S FUN. JUST 'CAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE ME, YOU'RE NOT ME. THEY'RE THE SAME JACKET. Tracy: TRY IT ON, MATTIE. LOOK, MATT, WE'RE GONNA BE TWINS. OH, THREE-QUARTER, THAT'S WHAT'S UP. THERE'S OTHER STUFF IN HERE LATER, TRACY, IF YOU WANT TO LOOK. Tracy: SOME COOL STUFF IN HERE. THOSE GREY SWEATERS, THAT'S MY COLOR TOO. - LOCK UP THE TRUNK, DAD. - OKAY, NOW-- IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE CAR THAT SHOULD BE LOCKED UP? - NO, HOW LONG ARE WE GOOD FOR? - AN HOUR. - MATT? - YES. MATT, THEY'VE GOT IT ON SALE FOR $1.99. JUST CHECK HOW LONG UNTIL-- JUST CONCENTRATE TOWARDS THAT. THIS IS WHAT WE DO NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T GET HIGH. SO WE GOT TO FIND OTHER THINGS TO DO. - YOU KNOW WHAT-- - WE DO VIDEOGAMES. BUT THIS IS GOOD. WHEN YOU WERE A KID YOU DID VIDEOGAMES. IT WAS HEALTHY FOR YOU. YOU LEARN FROM VIDEOGAMES. KNOW WHAT YOU LEARN? YOU GOT A LOT OF TIME ON YOUR HANDS WHEN YOU STOP GETTING HIGH. THERE'S A LOT OF TIME IN THE DAY. YOU KNOW A JOB CAN REALLY FILL YOUR TIME PRETTY GOOD. WITH MY DAUGHTER, CHRISTMAS SEEMS TO COME EVERY OTHER DAY. - THANK YOU. - HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. "DEAR TRACY, I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE DOING SO MUCH BETTER. BEST OF LUCK. I WILL BE E-MAILING YOU. I LOVE YOU ALWAYS. PLEASE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME. LOVE, YOUR AUNT SUPPORTER. I BELIEVE IN YOU, I ALWAYS WILL AND I KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED. JUDY." THAT'S GREAT. IT'S MY COOLEST AUNT TOO. AS MUCH AS SHE THINKS THE WORLD HAS TURNED HER OFF OR SHE'S TURNED OFF THE WORLD, THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT HER TO MAKE IT AND COME BACK. AND I'LL ALSO HELP YOU, MATTHEW, BECAUSE SOMETIMES IN YOUR LIFE THERE'S NO REAL STRONG MALE FIGURE. WE'LL HELP YOU AS MUCH AS WE CAN, BUT WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOUR HELP. MONEY MEANS NOTHING IF YOU LOSE YOUR CHILD FOR LIFE. AND IN THE LONG RUN, WE STILL COULD LOSE TRACY OR WE COULD LOSE MATTHEW. BUT TO GIVE UP WITHOUT TRYING AND NOT PUT OUT EVERY EFFORT YOU CAN TO HELP THEM GET BACK, UH, I THINK THAT'S THE WHOLE THING ABOUT BEING A PARENT. YOU BROUGHT THIS PERSON INTO THE WORLD, YOU DO YOUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY SURVIVE THIS WORLD. AND IF THEY FALL DOWN, YOU HELP THEM. - YOU WANT SOME? - Tracy: YEAH. - HOW OILY IS IT NOW? - NOT AT ALL. TODAY WE'RE MOVING INTO OUR NEW PLACE OVER IN BROOKLYN. IT'S MATT AND I'S FIRST APARTMENT TOGETHER AND IT'S A HUGE PLACE. WE REALLY LUCKED OUT AND GOT A GREAT PLACE. MY DAD'S HELPING US FURNISH-- WE'RE FURNISHING IT. THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. THIS IS GONNA BE OUR HOME TOGETHER FOR A WHILE. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE HOME WE GET MARRIED IN. FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE DON'T HAVE TO USE A CREDIT CARD TO ENTER THIS DOOR. Tracy: WE HAVE KEYS. SEE THAT? THAT'S DOOR NUMBER ONE. CHING, CHING. Tracy: THIS SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLE. AND MY DAD GOT US 40 OR 50 DVDS TO START OUT A COLLECTION, SO WE-- Ma AND EVERY TIME HE COMES, TRUST ME, IT'S LIKE HIS SWEATERS. HE'S GOING TO COME WITH 10 OF THEM. IF YOU LOOK IN MY CLOSET, WE'VE GOT 600 SWEATERS. - YOU THINK I'M KIDDING? COME HERE. - WHERE? Ma THIS IS OUR SWEATER CLOSET. IT'S ALL SWEATERS. IF YOU LOOK BEHIND MY BED OVER THERE, THERE'S FOUR MORE BIG GARBAGE BAGS-- SWEATERS! WE'RE THOROUGHLY SICK AND TIRED OF THAT LIFESTYLE OUT THERE. THIS ISN'T A WHIM AND THIS ISN'T TO HUMOR MY FATHER. THIS IS WHAT WE WANT. MATT AND I STILL HAVE SOME ISSUES WE GOT TO WORK ON, BUT THOSE THINGS ARE LESSENING AND THE POSITIVE THINGS ARE, YOU KNOW, JUST MORE AND MORE SO. - I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. I'M NOT CONCERNED AT ALL. - OH YEAH. - Woman: Hello? - I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. I FORGOT MY KEY. CAN YOU LET ME IN? I LIVE ON THE FOURTH FLOOR. - Who is it? - O'BRIEN. - Oh. - ( door buzzes ) THANK YOU. I MISS MICHELLE. WE ALWAYS COME HERE TOGETHER. I WASN'T REALLY PLANNING ON LEAVING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I JUST GOT FUCKING-- I JUST GOT-- NODDED OUT AND WHEN I WOKE UP IT WAS LIKE AN HOUR LATER. AND, YOU KNOW, I KEPT LOSING SENSE OF DIRECTION. I KNEW MICHELLE WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY MAD AT ME. SO I DIDN'T BOTHER GOING ANYWHERE. AAH! I'M FUCKING FREEZING. HOW COULD HE HAVE A CONSCIENCE? LOOK AT THE FUCKING WEATHER. AND WHERE IS HE? ( chuckles ) AND IS HE WONDERING WHERE I AM FREEZING? WHERE'S SEBASTIAN, UNDER A FUCKING QUILT RIGHT NOW SNUGGLED UP WITH A DICK UP HIS ASS? HI, ALVIN. IT'S SEBASTIAN. HEY, CAN I COME OVER? ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S YOUR-- WHAT'S THE NUMBER OF YOUR BUILDING? OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU SOON. HA HA! WHEN MICHELLE IS NOT WITH ME SOMETIMES I CAN'T FIND A PLACE TO STAY, I-- I CALL PEOPLE LIKE THIS PERSON AND I HANG OUT WITH THEM AND GET HIGH OR WHATEVER. AND SOMETIMES, I-- YOU KNOW, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT, I END UP STAYING FOR THE NIGHT IF THEY DON'T BOTHER ME AND I FEEL-- I FEEL SAFE. Michelle: IT'S SO FUCKING COLD. LIKE A HALLWAY LIKE THIS-- THIS AIN'T WARM, MAN. I WAKE UP, I'M FUCKING FREEZING. I MEAN, IT FELT GOOD IN THAT DETOX THE OTHER NIGHT. YOU KNOW, TO GET INTO A FUCKING BED-- TWO DAYS OF THAT. IT'S THE WORSE THAT IT'S EVER BEEN. THE CRACK IS JUST KILLING ME. IT'S KILLING ME. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO STOP. IF I WANT TO STOP. I MEAN, I'M SURE I WANT TO STOP. 'CAUSE WHO THE FUCK WANTS TO LIVE LIKE THIS? I MEAN I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH SEBASTIAN ANYMORE. WHICH I-- I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT. I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVED HIM. OH MY GOD, HE WAS MY LIFE. WHICH HE STILL IS. I MEAN I'D DO ANYTHING FOR HIM, BUT... WITH THE DRUGS JUST-- THERE'S NOTHING THERE. RIGHT NOW, IT'S TOO FUCKING COLD. I'M GOING ON THE TRAIN. JUST RIDE BACK AND FORTH ALL NIGHT. IT'S A ROUGH PLACE TO STAY WARM BECAUSE THE COPS GIVE YOU A REALLY HARD TIME. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, I REMEMBER SEEING THIS, LIKE ON TV, YOU KNOW? I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT THE OTHER DAY. YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS GRAND CENTRAL AND THE HOMELESS PEOPLE. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT THE OTHER DAY AND THEN I SAID, "I'M PART OF THIS. I AM PART OF THAT NOW." WHAT I USED TO LOOK AT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, THESE PEOPLE SAYING, "HOW COULD THEY SLEEP THERE? WELL, HOW COME THEY DON'T HAVE A BED?" AND I'M LIVING IT NOW. ( trains rumbling )
