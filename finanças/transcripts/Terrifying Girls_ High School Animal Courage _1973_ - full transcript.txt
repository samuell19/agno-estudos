Will do. What are you looking at? That's dangerous. - Mister, would you change this bill for me? - Change the bill? Alright! - Let's go. - Okay. Here you are.

Now that you've transferred to our school, you've become part of the elite. You have to do your best to improve, not damage, our school's reputation. Dean, enough speeches! This is Executive Samejima. Introduce yourselves. I am Masae Aso, transferred from Hanayama School. Shoplifting, Pickpocket -3 Incidents I am Shizuko Abe, transferred from Shinano-Mejo School. Inappropriate Sexual Behavior -3 Incidents Violence, Threats -3 Incidents I am Masami Araki, transferred from Izumi-Gaoka School. Apparently, you've led a messy life in your previous schools. Discipline is very strict at our school. I approved your admission because you promised you would study hard. I am Akazue Kobayakawa, transferred from Kasugano School. Kobayakawa! You were the top student at Kasugano School. Why did you come to our school? I was attracted to Seiwa School's overseas study program. You want to study overseas? Excellent Student You will definitely pass the test. We have a sister school in California called Gregory College. If you pass the test, the school will take care of the overseas study costs. I would like you to study hard and apply for the program. - Koyaba! - Yes! - Process their admission. - Yes. Everyone! Follow me. There were supposed to be five transfer students. Is there any other one? Yes. Aki Kazahana, transferred from Asahi School. - She hasn't showed up yet. - Kazahana... She's the younger sister of Miki Kazahana, our best student, who is overseas at the moment. From what I've heard, she was uncontrollable and got kicked out from Asahi School. You're very good at collecting information. Leader! The number of transfer students was four. Four? It should be five. Apparently, Aki Kazahana hasn't showed up. Aki Kazahana... She must be Aki the Whistler, who everybody was afraid of in Asahi School. It's not like the other four are better. I don't know much about the Whistler, but I don't think she is a big deal. Pick one. The last one must be problematic. - What is this? - Every girl's friend. Every girl's friend? This is a new model made in Sweden. I can't sleep without this. I told you to stop! Confiscated! What are you doing? Are you going to use it yourself? Shut up! If you don't follow my orders, you will get kicked out immediately! What are you talking about? We already paid 3 million yen to be here. That's right. I've heard too much about Seiwa School's policy of selling freedom for money. Get the fuck out! What a stupid thing to say. Behave yourself, new transfers! Who are you? Don't forget how fierce Seiwa School's Black Rose clan is! Let's start the initiation ceremony. It's our tradition. Get naked! You have to show us every single part of your body. We'll say hi to your clits. Get naked! Let me go! Let me go! Shit! - Let me go! - Undress! Be a good girl! Good! Let's do it! Let me go! Let me go! Be a good girl! - Stop moving! - Be quiet! - Let's start! - Wait a second! We will review every single part of your body very closely! You can see it by yourself! Hey! Take a good look! You are supposed to welcome new transfers. - Torturing weaklings is a shameful thing. - You must be Aki the Whistler. Could you please stop calling me that? Starting today, I am Aki Kazahana from Class B of Year 3 of Seiwa School. - Do you think you look cool? - Stop it! She is too strong for you. Maybe you were treated well at Asahi School but I can't let you behave like that here. Don't forget it. Impressive! You are Aki the Whistler. With you, the Black Rose clan can't do anything. I am Masae Aso aka Horse. I am Masami Araki. I am Shizuko Abe aka Big Tits. I am Akazue Kobayakawa. She is an excellent student, unlike us. What an interesting group. Aki! You're our leader starting today. Don't tell me stupid shit. Unpack your stuff and get some rest. I see. The number of infractions committed by the transfer students is 36 in total. Anyway, what happened to the girl who hurt a teacher's arm? Aki Kazahana? She behaves herself at the moment. Kazahana? Is she Miki's younger sister? How do you know Miki Kazahana? She was my classmate. Anyway, in October, an agent from headquarters will visit Japan... to test students applying for the overseas program. How are the students this year? President! Don't worry. I think we can send good students this year. Hey! High school students are not supposed to smoke! Sis, give me 30,000 yen. Again? I gave you money the other day. I need more. Mr. Samejima has been worried about you. There seems no other way than kicking you out if you get arrested again. It's always the same! Samejima this, Samejima that! It's just dirty money from Samejima after all. Ryuko! We have no family other than us. I want you to be more serious in life. Don't make your sister sad. Enough with the depressing talk! The only sister I have has become an idiot's mistress. It would look weird if I become an excellent student. Ryuko! She hasn't changed at all. Sorry for the inconvenience. No worries. Girls should be lively at that age Sumiko! Stop! Everyone is still... I can't help it when the president is around. No, don't! Good, isn't it? Please stop! Enough! Your score for the 2nd semester has just dropped to zero! What is this? It's not mine! Somebody put it there! What are you talking about? This doesn't make sense. You'd better focus on your studies instead of this stuff. Moron! Answer! Your score for the 2nd semester also just dropped to zero! - It's not us! - What? - Somebody is tricking us. - That's right. Be quiet! I heard about how pathetic the new transfers were, but this beggars belief! I've had it! You are good. This is Hiroko Fukuda, top scorer of the archery club and vice president of the sports club. Nice to meet you. This is Chie Onomi, leading player of the valet club. There are a lot of benefits for you in the sports club. The residence is a perfectly furnished private room with facilities and baths. You'd better move out of that trashy placy. I don't really like rules. I'd rather stay at the trashy place. Like you prefer. But it's a shame that a good fighter like you has to stay there. She is just unique. Kazahana! I want you to fight in this year's competition. Mr. President! This is Aki Kazahana, who just joined our fencing club. I see. You are just as attractive as your sister. It seems you're behaving yourself. I've heard good things about you. I've chosen her as this year's competitor. We want you to improve Seiwa School's reputation on a national level. Please do your best. What are you doing here? I was overwhelmed by all the people. It doesn't have to be like that. We're the symbol of Seiwa School. The number of overseas program applicants fluctuates every year. Kazahana! You shouldn't get involved with pathetic guys. That is just a new chauffeur for the president. You seem really into it. I want to pass the test and go to the US. Just like your older sister. Self-Portrait 2nd Overseas Program Student, Class A of Year 3, Miki Kazahana You'll definitely pass it. I can guarantee. How? Because you look exactly like my older sister during her school days. But why do you want to go to the US so badly? My mother lives in the US. Your mother? She got remarried to an American and relocated. But I don't know where she is now. So I want to seize this opportunity to go to the US and find her. Your heart is already in the US. I've met two wonderful people since I came to this school. One is you, of course. The other one is your sister. - Auntie! Warm water is out! - I'm on it! Someone is watching us. It's true. Someone is watching. Interesting. Let's trick him. Okay. You idiot! Is it the teacher? Did you really want to see our naked bodies? This is a misunderstanding! As a teacher, I have the right to check every single part of your body. That's right. That doesn't make sense! Come here! I'll help you! What are you doing? I'm your teacher! - Stop! - Be quiet! Stop! Stop it! Go! That hurts! And now... What a sad little dick! We'll service you like you wanted. How pathetic you are. How about doing that for us? Then you can become another animal in our zoo. Are you coming or not? Follow me. What is this? The same amount again? When I said 50,000 yen, I didn't mean it was the maximum. Show me the record. The income hasn't been great recently. Can you keep running the Black Rose clan with this amount? Hey! Ryuko! Are you hiding money from me? If you have something to say, say it right now! Hey, say something! If you're hiding money, I'll replace you as leader right now. Leader, there is no such thing as secret income. Be quiet! You know what happens if you disobey the rules of the sports club, right? Well?! Do you?! Leader! Where is the fencing club? Thanks. Wait! - I have something to ask. - What is it? What are you whistling? Well... What is it... Where did you learn it? Who'd remember such inconsequential stuff? You really liked it, didn't you? That's annoying! Stop! That tickles, Papa! Your skin has become shinier. Thanks. It's because of your hormones. It's become bigger! Such a great ass! Yeah, right. Papa! Let's have a meal. What will we have today? The strongest royal jelly. Papa, you should start slowly. Papa! What happened to the favor I talked to you about? About the funds for the sports club, right? - Yes. - I know, I know. I'll order the officer to take care of it. Really? I'm so happy! - Papa! - What is it? Papa... More! Excuse me. I wanted to talk with you alone. I refuse. No good can come from introducing yourself to me. Don't read too much into this. The only thing I want to know is who created that melody. What a weird thing to say. There are only two people in this world who know that melody. And you're saying that's us? Don't play innocent! My sister composed that melody for me. You know my sister, right? Of course I do. Your sister is very famous for her excellence in the school's history. But I heard her younger sister isn't as good. - Cut the crap! - Sorry, sorry. I just don't like tough chicks. Maybe Seiwa is the perfect zoo for an animal like you. What are you trying to say? How about it? Want to listen to some music? Papa! What happened to the favor I talked to you about? About the funds for the sports club, right? I know, I know. I'll order the officer to take care of it. What do you say now? Seiwa School sure is an interesting place. More! Yes, this is the Black Rose dating club. Of course, there are many cute girls here. Yes. At the cafe in front of the payphone. Thank you. Hey, transfers! A job for you! What do you mean by job? Just use your lower body. We don't take no for an answer in the Black Rose clan. What a cute uniform. Good. Very good. Mister! Call me directly next time. Sure, sure! I love you! You shouldn't exhaust yourself too much because you're still young. Let's have one more round for 5,000 yen. Really? I will try my best! Good! I am starting! What happened? Wake up! Tits... Tits... Tits... Mine was quite young. - I spent the whole night. - How much? I made a proper profit for the first round. The remaining 7 rounds were all for me. They couldn't supervise the room anyway. Can you tell me the story in detail? You bitch! Aki! Emergency! The Black Rose clan got Masami and the others. Maybe those three did something. You should do something as their roommate! Hurry! They were being dragged to the stadium. There is a punishment for traitors. Let's show them Seiwa's special sports skill. It's not that different from a real game. Use them for target practice. Listen! If you move a little bit, you die. The archery club will definitely win the competition this time. It's my turn now. Stand up! Be quiet! Stop! Hand them over to me. What? The Black Rose clan should take care of their punishment. You don't have the authority to do this! This betrayal happened because you aren't doing your job properly. If you can't lead them, you're disqualified as leader of the Black Rose clan. What's with that look? If we don't support you, the Black Rose clan will be disbanded in a minute. Does sucking up the money mean support? Even today's session was initiated by one of you. - Who was it? - Me. You're no longer a member of the Black Rose clan. How long do you think you can behave like that? I won't allow you to do anything anymore! I'll take care of them. No objections, right?! I don't know. What? The Black Rose clan? President! It'll be a big deal if Ikue and Midori can't compete for Seiwa. Let's destroy the Black Rose clan. Stop! Let me go! You cowards! What are you going to do? Are you siding with the Black Rose clan? I don't care about sides. I just beat up cowards. That's all. Run! You'll pay for this! You bitch! Wait! You'd better not make the sports club your enemy. The corruption between the sports club and the school is well known. You can't defeat them by playing fair.. What do you want? What I want? Getting closer to their dark side is my hobby. You're quite pathetic yourself. Drink. It'll warm you up. You must've been my sister's boyfriend. Tell me. Where did you meet my sister? In the US, right? I haven't heared from he in more than a year. Tell me what happened to my sister. That kind of talk can wait. I will tell you when your test is finished. What you did was betrayal! Don't you feel ashamed as a member of the sports club? How annoying... I didn't do anything for the Black Rose clan. What? I just can't stand cowardice. - Aren't you the one who started it? - Nonsense! The Black Rose clan started it! Fight properly this time. Kazahana! You don't know much about this school yet. You'd better not do anything stupid. That's all for today. President! This is bad for our morale. Why didn't you punish her? It can't be helped. If Kazahana quits, we lose a fencing player for the competition. I'll get the school to punish the Black Rose clan. But Mr. President, she is the cause of this problem. You'd better stop listening to her tantrum. I think so too. But she has a great body and fucked me real good. She must be a great student. How about it? You want in? I don't think anyone would. Mr. President! I recommend you don't touch our students. What a stupid thing to say. Who'd run an all girls' school without exploiting young girls? But Mr. President! Anyway, we'll kick out the one who invaded the sports club. What if the students say that it's unfair... We don't have time to worry what every single one of them thinks. Mr. President! I hired a teacher called Isshiki Mawari who can discipline even the worst kids. Isshiki Mawari? She successfully disciplined juvenile delinquents in prison. She'll be able to help us. Shit! Senko Mizutani, Yasuko Gomi, Expelled - That's unfair! - Expelled? - That's corrupt! - Leader! Right. Let's head to the dean's office. Who are you? How rude! Go back. Punishing Senko and Yasuko isn't fair! Tell me why you don't punish the sports club! - What's going on? - Why do you treat the sports club like that? We pay the same amount of money! The tuition is the same. All of you will be punished! It's not your turn! Shut up! We don't have time to listen to all of you! We know exactly what you're talking about! The reason they aren't expelled is that we want to turn them into proper adults in society! What do you mean by proper adults? Stop talking nonsense! - She's right! - You still don't get it?! If I called the police now, you'd all go to prison! Who are you? What are you doing? Death is waiting for us. Don't gamble with your life. What? I'm preventing you from fighting a battle you can't win. None of your business. Well, that's my character. Forget about me in the past. I'm busy today. Of course, not trying to stop a person twice is also my character. Move! If you really have to go, there is no other way but to fight. I was born in Wakayama and raised in the red-light district in Juso. I started fiddling game cards as a kid. They call me Yu the Spade. I would like to challenge you. I was born and raised in Nishinomiya. I was hanging around the Koshien Stadium. They call me Aki the Whistler. I am going to accept your challenge. 1st Test for the Overseas Program Put down your pens. If you pass the 1st test, you will undergo physical examination on the 5th, the day after tomorrow. Then you will attend the welcoming party for Mr. Spencer, the president of the Gregory College. Next! Akazue Kobayakawa! Yes. This way. Kobayakawa! Take your off your uniform! We are taking body pictures for Gregory College. Why? Since Gregory College is a catholic school, students should be virgins. Please undress. No one has refused to do this. If you won't do it, we will consider you dangerous. Got it? She has a good body. Now is the best time to eat. Starting now, we are having a party. Please. Kazue! You look gorgeous today. What? You don't look good. What happened? No, nothing. Keep an eye on Spencer. What do you say? This year's students are all great, right? Yes, Japanese girls grow up quite fast nowadays. And Japanese women are the most skilled as well. I would like to take them immediately. 150,000 dollars for 6 of them. How's that? No. The minimum is 180,000 dollars. Inevitable. I accept. Oh, no, no dollars. Make it yen. I'll take her first. Unfortunate for you, Mr. President. No other choice. Students are our product anyway. You bitch! Wait! Are you okay? Shit! I met your sister on a ship on the Pacific Ocean. Both of us were excited about the overseas study program. During the long journey on the ship, we started liking each other. We separated in San Francisco, promising a reunion. Miki was heading to Los Angeles and I was heading to New York. I wrote letters every day. But she never wrote back. I just couldn't help myself. So I crossed the country over 5,000 km. There was no such place as Gregory College. It was an address for a tiny old building. It was an office for the mafia. I went looking for her in every corner of Los Angeles. When I found Miki, she had become a call girl. My sister become a call girl? I was too late. Her body was already corrupted by an illness. When I tried to sneak her out of the mafia office to the hospital, it was already too late. Did my sister die? I swore I'd avenge Miki and punish whoever made her like that. I will destroy Seiwa School and kill the mafia boss Spencer with my own hands. Please stop! How can you offer up a helpless girl like her as sacrifice? Shut up! I've already sacrificed enough for you. If you don't stop it, I will. - Sumiko! - Let me go! Wait! Do you know what you are doing? Sumiko! Stop! No! Let me go! Aki! Farewell. My soul will go looking for my mother in the US. Aki! Thank you so much! I will cherish your friendship and encouragement forever, even in heaven. Let us go through! Go ahead if you can! Wait! Ranko Fukazawa! You used your dirty relationship with the president to torture others! Finally, your mask has come off. Aki! You're a traitor! The holy spirit of sports in me won't forgive you! I'll punish you! Stop! You can't touch Ranko! Who the fuck are you?! I am a hunter who kills animals disguised as educators. The pigs who have sucked the blood of students with innocent looks. Today is judgement day! Wait! Wait! Ryuko! Let's begin with the punishment of you and Seiwa School. As the elite chosen for the overseas program... please improve Seiwa School's reputation even in the US and be like an angel. Haven't you seen the president and the executive? I heard that they left their houses an hour ago. The bouquet! What's going on? Dean, what is this? What is this? Who are you? We are going to hold a funeral for Seiwa School. Funeral for Seiwa School Put it down. Bring them. President Shinohara! Executive Samejima! Deputy Kemochi! And Spencer! The overseas study program created by them is totally fake! Actually, it's a program to sell students to whorehouses. That's a lie! Don't say anything else! - Shoot her! - Shut up! You are the pigs who sold human beings. There is more than enough evidence. 150,000 dollars for 6 of them. How's that? No. The minimum is 180,000 dollars. Inevitable. I accept. Students are our product anyway. Students are our product anyway. Students are our product anyway. Everyone! Stop! Let go! That hurts! Stop! I don't need this dirty uniform anymore!
