What is that idiot doing now? Huh? You! I guess it's also too big for these arrows to work. Get back! This thing's too powerful! You don't think I have what it takes, huh? Yeah, well, I'm full of surprises... Huh? Huh? Are you... It can't be! Lancelot? THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS: GRUDGE OF EDINBURGH PART 2 No way... It was you the whole time? Feels like I just woke up from a nightmare. I think a Human put a spell on us. Giants and Demons? Where'd they come from? What are they doing here? You know that monster we just fought? Someone turned those beings into it. And they used the Fairy Race for the other one. Thanks so much. You're the ones who saved us, aren't you? Human. You have our eternal gratitude. As of this day, we are in your debt. Don't mention it. You're just lucky that I was out here. You should get going. 'Cause they could be sending reinforcements at any moment. Huh? Whoever did this seems to be after non-Human races. My people are targets... So we must leave here. Thank you again, Human. Let us know if we can ever repay you. Like I said, don't mention it. So that's it. They're on the hunt for anyone who's not Human. Now I get it. You were in your Fairy Form 'cause you wanted to get caught. I totally forgot. Your mother was a Fairy Queen. It completely slipped my mind. Hey, Lancelot... There's something I need to... - Hey, Tristan. - Huh? Huh? What was that? Do you sucker punch all your friends in the face? Our parents may be friends but that doesn't make us anything. Yeah, well, whatever! It doesn't mean I deserve a beating! You didn't hold back either! That really hurt! It only hurts because you're still alive. Listen. If not for me, you'd be dead now. You idiot. Why'd you stop attacking in the middle of the fight? Huh? You were holding back again, weren't you? Just like you did with me... It's just... I get scared of what I might do. Sometimes it feels like I'm becoming something else. I don't know why I'm even telling you this. You wouldn't understand. Why would you? It's not like you know anything about me in the first place. No, I don't know. And I don't care either. What? If you wanna get yourself killed by holding back, that's up to you. But if you die, what do you think will happen to your mother? Huh? You mentioned earlier that someone put her under a terrible curse. I don't have anything but respect for her. And she's someone my own mother holds dear. Her fever's gone down. The color's returned to her cheeks too. Looks like the potion King brought worked like a charm. So that's the ancient elixir of the Fairy Race. It really works miracles... This nectar's from flowers near the top of the Sacred Tree. It's very rare. - Can I have it? Oh. - Sorry. No. Sadly, there isn't more this elixir can do. It was only able to lift a fraction of the curse. The majority of it still nests deep within Lady Elizabeth's mind like a haunting shadow. If we could just free her for even a second... she could easily finish off the curse using her magic. Captain. Whatcha think? Any idea who would've done something like this to her? Can't say for sure. There are too many possible suspects to count. Hmm. Well, I guess that's true, yeah. Wait a minute. I just realized... I haven't seen Tristan since I got here. Where is he? That poor kid. He tried his best to use his magic to lift his mother's curse, but... it was just too strong for him. He ran straight out of the room right after that. Must've been from the shock of it all. Hold on. Did he find them? - Huh? - Hmm? Huh? Oh, Elizabeth, I really hope you can get through this quickly. - Diane. - Huh? You're full size. Did you run out of the Minimum Tablets Merlin gave you? I'm completely out. Guess a few things came up. Anyway, Gowther, you seriously don't need to keep me company out here, you know? Unfortunately, I'm no expert at curses. While I can enter Elizabeth's mind easily, I'm still unable to set her free. I know how you feel. I wish I could do something to help too, but I can't. But then, I think about how much worse Captain and Tristan must feel... Did Tristan grow up to be a good kid? Yes. He has his mother's kindness. And he's strong, just like his father. Actually, I'd say there's only one thing the boy is truly missing... - Okay, you two. - Mm? Hmm? Captain? Huh? Elizabeth? - Gowther. - Hmm? I'm gonna need you to track down Tristan's magic aura. All right, Captain. Get as close to his exact location as you can. And Diane... Huh? I need you to do that thing. Uh... What thing? Here's what I don't get. If you're so scared of going all out in a fight, then why'd you decide to do this on your own, anyway? Why not just let your old man take care of it for you? He's the captain of the Seven Deadly Sins after all. Yeah. You're right. All I had to do was tell him what I saw inside my mother's mind. And if I'd done that... he'd be the one here instead of me and probably would've saved her by now. But still... But still, you wanted to be the one to save her, so you rushed out of the castle on your own. - Isn't that right? - Ah! Hey, yeah, you're exactly right! How'd you know that? Why am I not surprised? You're just as predictable as ever. Well, sorry. Not everyone can change quite as much as you have. Uh, Lancelot? What? Look at the castle? Uh... Huh? Who are you talking to? - Look. - Huh? I can't believe they sent an entire army to take out two kids. Crap! We need to get out of here and fast! Hey, Escanor! Wait! Let's go! Nothing's gonna stop me. I can't turn back now. Not when I'm so close to catching the person who cursed Mother! Now up, Escanor! Oh, no way. Whoa... We're... flying? Of course you're not flying, you colossal idiot! Oh, Lancelot! Yeah, that makes more sense. What the hell were you thinking charging in like that? Keep it up, Lancelot! Don't let go! Now what are they doing? Honestly... those two are gonna be the death of me. Float up, float up! Can't you fly any higher? I could if you weren't weighing me down! No! O-Oh, n-n-n-no no, no! What just happened? All of this ice came out of thin air! Wait, this is... It's a full-on ice bridge! I can't believe it. Lancelot, is this your handiwork? What? Who cares? Let's just get to the castle and take out whoever's behind all this. Right! Let's do it! Great. I'm never gonna live this down. Full Counter! We've almost made it! Don't stop! I'm sorry. I shouldn't have dragged you into this. Now, because of me, you're... Did I say I was doing this for you? I was already heading here when you screwed up my plan. I could've been in and out by now, you know. Lancelot. Did you come here because you wanna save someone you care about too? Do you think the only reason I would do this is for somebody else? Then why are you here? It seemed like fun. Ah. Huh? Uh? Impressive. I applaud your courage and enthusiasm. Prince Tristan of the Kingdom of Liones, and Prince Lancelot of the Kingdom of Benwick. My esteemed guests. I humbly welcome you to Edinburgh Castle. How rude of me. I haven't introduced myself yet, have I? I am the king of New Edinburgh, Deathpierce. So... I take it you're the one who's behind all this? Huh? Hmm. It's him. Remove the curse you put on my mother! Now don't worry. I'll make sure your parents receive your body when I'm through. Hmm. Why did you get in my way? Isn't it obvious? He's the mastermind behind everything. He set this whole thing up. So that makes you the one who cursed my mother. But why? Why would you hurt her? Your mother's not the only one whose suffering you should be worried about. Take your father, for instance. Imagine how painful it must be for him to watch helplessly as his wife slowly dies in front of him. What's the point of all this? What do you want? When I was a young man, I was given a home and a purpose by a Holy Knight who trained me to be a part of his order. However, that Knight was cruelly murdered before my eyes by a Demon who appeared out of nowhere. Then, as I thirsted for vengeance, a Goddess bestowed upon me a so-called gift that made me their faithful servant. A Goddess and a Demon... you mean my mother and father did that? No, dummy. This isn't the first time I've heard that story. Except the Demon and Goddess you're talking about... both died in the Holy War that followed. That's right. The ones truly deserving of my vengeful wrath are already dead! So in their place, Meliodas and Elizabeth, the leaders of the Demon and Goddess Races, must be held responsible for their crimes against man! So you're just taking it out on them. You... Foolish brat! How dare you. Release my mother from her curse right now! So you possess the Goddess Race powers of your mother. That's not bad. Quite impressive for someone your age. Huh? No way. He slowed them down somehow. Even so, you'll have to do much better than that. What? This time, he made every shot go around him! And even managed to weaken the impact of each one! Foolish children. You don't have a chance. I figured out your trick. What? You can control the speed, the strength and movement of your opponent's attacks and that makes long range spells useless in battle. But when it comes to direct attacks, your magic can't protect you. Impossible. How did this lowly cur learn the secret of my spell, Melody, so quickly? Tristan! I'm gonna try to keep Deathpierce distracted so he can't use his ability against your magic. Oh. Huh? That monster over there is the one cursing your mother, right? So go take it out! Yeah. Let's do this! Twinkle Star! Huh? I can't give up now. I'll save my mother no matter what it takes! Unbelievable. How can a child be so strong? Arrogant whelp... He's not even using a weapon. Prince Lancelot, son of King Ban, why are you fighting against us? We belong on the same side. You and I are Human. We shouldn't be fighting. The non-Human races are the enemy. I'd kill them all if I could. That's why I attacked the Fairies and Giants, then transformed them into the monsters they truly are. The world will see that they're just as vile as those Demons and Goddesses. Why don't you understand? We're compatriots, don't you see? I only want to create a kingdom where our people can prosper. A world for Humans! Sorry, but I'm not a Human. I'm not a Fairy either. Lord Deathpierce! You'll pay for that. Curse you! Huh? Not again. I need to finish this fast. 'Cause if I don't, I might lose control. What if there comes a time when that's the only way you are able to help somebody? What would you do then? That's right. I'm here to lift the curse this monster placed on my mother. What happens to me doesn't matter. Huh? But Lancelot... What about him? I can't hurt him like last time. - Show me what you've got. - Huh? I want to see what you're so afraid of. It's about time that you get serious. Come on. Stop worrying about me and do your worst. Are you crazy? Do you have any idea what you're saying? So what are you waiting for? Stop stalling. Don't you wanna save your mother? Ah, you cocky little brats. I'll teach you to defy me! Huh? I've wasted enough time on you children. I'm ending this. Watch as I turn these loathsome creatures into your doom. So that's the source of all this. Okay. All I have to do is grab it! I have you now. Lancelot! You're neither Human nor Fairy, you say? How fascinating. Wonder what kind of monstrosity you'll be. How about we find out? Unfortunately, I can't imagine you becoming anything useful. Huh? Haven't you learned anything about my power? What? But it... it can't be. Is this Hellfire? But that would mean he possesses more than just the powers of the Goddess Race. Get out of here. Right. Why's he still holding back? Now don't think you've won so easily. I've still got the upper hand. This castle is surrounded by thousands of Empties thirsting for your blood. There's no way I'm letting pitiful worms leave here alive. He's right. There's no way we'll get through them all on our own. Ah. Huh? Nice. Looks like we made it. But where are we exactly? We're roughly 400 yards from our destination. Edinburgh Castle, huh? And you're sure this is where Tristan ran off to? There's no mistake. I can sense his magic just up ahead. Such power. This can only mean that they have arrived. The Seven Deadly Sins! Huh? Father? What's he doing here? Hey, who are all those guys? Empties! Burn those intruders alive. Father, look out! Full Counter! FULL COUNTER Good thing we could count on Diane to get us here so quickly. Here we go! Her throwing arm's as strong as ever and she still has incredible aim. Oh, yeah. Pretty sure she's had to toss us somewhere before, hasn't she? Hey, when was the last time we did that? 15 years ago. It was back when Hendrickson abducted Elizabeth, remember? Oh, yeah. That's right. Master got himself in a real sticky situation back then. Huh? Wow. No way. I mean, I've heard the stories, but I had no idea Father and his friends were this strong. Why'd my old man show up? Wait a second, I recognize that ice bridge. Lancelot. Looks like Tristan's not the only prince out here. There's no way. They can't possibly be this strong. They wiped out my army in an instant! This can't be happening. You mean we deliberately angered these impossibly powerful beings and made them our enemies? Unfortunately for you, your little attempt at an ambush has failed. Hmm. Mm. Hmm? - Captain! - Huh? Oh, looks like they've made it. It's a warzone down there. Good thing we got here fast. What do you think happened? Who cares? I have a surprise for you, Captain! You need to see this. Meliodas! Elizabeth! Your curse was broken? Yes. Mm. I'm so glad you're okay. Everybody's watching. He never changes. Meliodas! Ah. I was so worried. It was our son. Tristan was the one who saved me. I could feel his magic when my curse was broken. He lifted it himself, Meliodas. He did? Mother! Father! My mother's here! And she's totally fine! Good. I'm glad. Impossible. This wasn't supposed to happen. I wonder what would've happened if our fathers didn't show up. Would we still have won? Who knows? I'm just glad I got to see the real Full Counter in action. Now that was impressive. Okay, I get it. Mine's more like a Quarter Counter, big deal! Hey, Lancelot... Why were you pushing me so hard earlier? Because you were holding yourself back. And you weren't giving it your all. It's just that... I was scared of losing control and worried that I might hurt you again. The same way I did when we were younger. Actually, I was afraid I'd do something worse. You idiot. There you go pissing me off again. What? Seriously? I was just thinking about your safety! So annoying. You're running? Well, that's lame. So when the going gets tough, cowards run. Huh? - Get back here! - Hey, wait! Don't worry, Escanor! I'll be back before you know it! Oh? Hmm? Where am I anyway? I don't know. This place is different. We might not even be in Britannia. Lancelot! What are we doing chasing after that loser? We already beat him, so what's the point? Don't you get it? We need to catch him so we can make him swear that he'll never do something like this again. Huh? Huh? Tristan! What a mess. Looks like they really threw down in here. I wonder what happened. Huh? Escanor! Should've known you'd be here! Escanor? What happened? Mm-hm. Wait, you mean you can talk to it? All right, boy. Do you know where Tristan went? I don't understand a single word you just said. What? Tristan chased after a man with a mustache. Then they disappeared into some hazy thing? Someone else was there? Another boy around Tristan's age followed after them? I'd bet anything they were facing Deathpierce. Wait. Deathpierce? Last I heard, he had some deep-seated hatred for any and all non-Humans. Based on what we've seen, I wouldn't be surprised if he was behind this. Okay, but what about the other boy? The one around Tristan's age. Who was that? That would be my kid. You mean Lancelot? Why was he here? Ban, is there something you're not telling us? Listen, we've got our own crap to deal with. What about the hazy thing? My own theory is that it was a magic portal leading to another dimension. Uh... Eamateko dotoioronagau... ...osokodoranku... It's you. You're the one who cursed me! Elizabeth! Now to fulfill my orders and finally kill Elizabeth of the Goddess Race! No... Impossible. You caught me off guard last time. Striking me while I was asleep. This time, however, I'm wide awake. My son went through a lot of trouble to break your curse. You won't hurt us again. Let there be light. It turned into a bunch of Demons! What is this? It's okay! We're not going to attack you. The Holy War's been over for a while. Exactly. Let's not fight. The five races should work together toward a peaceful future. What? Oh. They just left. What was all that about, Captain? What did they say? "We're never going to trust Humans. They hunted down and captured Demons, Giants, and Fairies. They turned us into monsters to do their bidding." By using that power. Using what power? Why'd they have to be so vague? Just what kind of threat are Tristan and Lancelot going up against? How dare you! You think you can lecture me? You think yourselves on the side of good and that I must be evil? Pathetic! Why didn't he just keep running? It sounds like you really ticked him off. I never said that you're evil. It just doesn't make sense to blame all non-Humans for your own personal problems. Huh? So I just have to accept that Lord Denzel was murdered at the hands of a filthy non-Human? That it's nobody's fault that our devotion to Lord Denzel was exploited by those manipulative creatures? Uh... There's something strange going on with him. Yeah. What they've done is unforgivable! He's no longer in his right mind. The staff's doing this. I must have my vengeance. This can't really be happening. It must be a nightmare! Real or not, that thing's dangerous. It's kill or be killed! Right. Stay focused! Oh! Ooh. You moron. You need to stop holding back if you want to survive this! Yeah, but I don't... Just watch! Whoa... You're going down. Follow me! What's the plan? Head for those rocks! I need you to buy me some time. Shooting Star! Take this! Did we get him? I thought that'd work! What did I tell you? We won't be able to beat that thing until you go all out! Huh? Wait! Lancelot! Lancelot! Oh, no... Tristan! Don't worry, Elizabeth. Tristan's gonna be fine. He is our son, after all. Yeah, but... Besides, Lancelot's with him. He'll have our son's back. Right, Ban? How the hell should I know? Come on. Seriously? He's your kid, isn't he? Tristan's strong, but he's afraid of giving it his all. He'll always hold back. He... He's worried he'll lose self-control and the blood in his veins will take over. - His Demon blood? - Yes. I've known for a while. He's been nervous about fighting ever since his tenth birthday. That's when he lost control and hurt Lancelot while they were training. If he ever loses control again, I plan to do whatever it takes to stop him. That is, if he'll even let me get close. But I'm pretty sure he doesn't trust me enough to be there. No, that's not how he feels at all. Speaking of how Tristan feels... I think I can help clear that up a bit. You do? What's his skin made of? What do I do? What do I do? He's way too strong. I can't win this. I'm gonna die here. I just know it. And yet... I can feel my blood burning inside me. My heart won't stop pounding... Why do I suddenly feel so alive? Wait. Lancelot's gone. That means there's nobody here to worry about. This monster and I have the whole battleground to ourselves. Hold on... They're alive? No. What have I done? - Oh, come on. - Huh? Just when you were finally starting to let loose. Those aren't real people. I can't sense any will or life force coming from them. Basically, they're just pieces of flesh shaped to look like those two. Lancelot! You're alive! Look. See how he's enjoying their screams? But seriously, what kind of twisted freak is he? That monster deserves to die. Now stop holding back so we can finish this. I don't get it. Why do you want me to lose control of myself so badly? Because I finally want to settle that fight we started all those years ago. You mean that time we were sparring on my tenth birthday? When I put that scar on your face? Yeah. I was still ready to keep going. Huh? But the adults didn't give us a choice. No, I'm gonna be all right. This is nothing! That's not the part that pissed me off though. Do you remember what you told me when I said I wanted to keep going? What? Stop! I don't wanna hurt you again! Huh? Basically, you were saying there wasn't a chance in hell that I could ever beat you. But that isn't what I meant. I swear. Shut up. I never thought I was going to lose to you. Not back then. And not now! - Huh? - You're afraid you're going to hurt me? Now come on, just who in the hell do you think you are? You've gotta be kidding. I don't care how strong you think you might be. No more holding back! I know that I can take you down and stop you. So show me what you've got! Hope you won't regret this. I'm trusting you. So don't let me down. Huh? I'm trusting you. So don't let me down. Yeah. I can explain. Tristan needs someone who can stop him if he loses control while using his Demon powers. Okay, sure, that does make sense... Hmm. ...but shouldn't that be the Captain? Well, let me put it this way. A fledgling has to leave the nest. Tristan isn't going to be a child forever, Captain. I think that's something he's already come to realize. What Tristan needs is someone he can trust. Someone who'll be like what Ban and the rest us are to you. Shining Road. SHINING ROAD Oh? He's a lot weirder than I thought. He passed out with a smile on his face... I guess now we know what was really causing all that trouble. They don't understand. No one but Humans belong in this world. I'll never forgive those who took from me the most important people in my life. They robbed me of my pride and left me with nothing! I understand just what you're going through. I, too, have been wronged. A-Aren't you... As someone who holds the same ideals and follows the same path, I wish to give you a gift. With the power of this fragment of chaos, you can remake the world. Incredible! Such power! I am in your debt... King Arthur! That's three of these so far. Tristan! He appears to be asleep. Of course he is. - What a relief. - Yeah. But what's going on here? Hmm? Huh? Deathpierce. I see. So he was the one behind everything. Ah. Huh? Uh, Mother? Where am I? They're finally reunited! Hey! Mother! Come on! Uh, hello, Father. Father, I didn't mean... I'm so sorry. Huh? You did good, Tristan. Real good. Huh? Huh! Father! Your clothes have been ripped to shreds. Ah. Thanks, Gowther. Hey, wait. Where's Lancelot? Uh... Ah. Huh? Lancelot! Jericho... take good care of Lancelot for me. I guess I'm back on babysitting duty. Seriously. He really is his father's son.
