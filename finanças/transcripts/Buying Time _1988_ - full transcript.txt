(Multicom Jingle) (bluesy rock music) (upbeat rock music) (water hissing) - Hey, where you been? Rosie's been looking all over for you. - No, really? Shit! - You are in deep trouble. What happened to you? - Man, I was up all night, okay? - What, a poker game? - No, I had to take my brother to the hospital. - The hospital? For what? - His fiancee cracked him over the head with a meat tenderizer. Boom! 10 stitches, man. - Sounds like a wedding made in heaven, Reno. - [Reno] You got that right, Sammy. - I didn't know your brother was getting married. - Well, neither did I. He knocked up Snooki Smith's sister, man. - No way! What did your dad say? - All he said was at least we know we ain't shooting blanks. (both laughing) (water hissing) (mischievous music) - Keep going, keep going. - [Man] Crank up the hot water. - [Man] It's coming! - [Man] Patch them up. - Dez, how you doing? - Hey, man, how you doing? Yeah, I got it right here. - [Man] Hey, at the front. - [Dez] Two lockers down, top row. - Okay, well, meet you at nine o'clock at the train station. - Yeah man, see you. - Okay. (water hissing) - Okay, go. (bluesy harmonica music) - My old man says I can't hang out at the pool hall no more. - Oh, yeah, why? - I don't know, too many speed freaks or something. Hey, Jab, can you do me a favor? - I'm broke right now. - No, listen, I got a no-lose proposition. - And I don't got the money. - Jab, this is no sucker bet, this is a solid bet, man. How many times have I steered you wrong? (chuckles) I mean intentionally. - Well, if it isn't the Indian twins. - You still smoking those shit sticks? - Keep your hands where I can see 'em! - Yeah, right here. - Goddamn kleptomaniac. (chuckles) - Listen, Jab, if Donaldson wins tonight, we stand to make four grand. - Oh, yeah, and if my aunt had balls-- - Yeah, I know, she'd be your uncle, right. - Right, that's good, that's good. - Listen, man, they say he's gonna take him in the third round. - Oh, yeah, who's they? - They, man, like, the people that know. - Reno, you don't know anyone who knows. - Okay, right, he's the dark horse, but he's the sentimental favorite. - Reno, read my lips, I don't got the money. - Okay, fine, man, I wasn't gonna tell you this but I owe some guys some serious money. - [Jabber] What guys? - I needed a quick score, Jab. - What guys? (Reno sighs) - The Burrito brothers. - Burrito brothers. Are you insane? Those guys will eat you for a side order of French fries, you dumb shit. - You can't always go for the short-end money, man. Once in a while, you know, you gotta take a long shot. - Man, you're a diseased human being, you know that? (Jabber sighs) - What do you say, man? - I'll think about it. - What does that mean? - It means I'll think about it. (upbeat rock music) - What are you doing? You can't do this! You son of a bitch, you've no right! Who the hell do you think you are? Put that back, put it back! What are you doing? - Mom, what's going on? - Oh, Ronnie, do something, please, do something. (sobbing) (crowd murmuring) - All right. - [Mover] Yeah, that's it. - Ange, how the hell did this happen? - The landlord raised the rent, so the bank called her loan. - Jesus! - He held out as long as he could. - But why didn't she borrow money from somewhere else? - What for, Ronnie? Ma's too old to be working 12 hours a day for nothing. - Wait a minute. We gotta do something here. This is all she knows. She doesn't know anything else. - Well, I don't have the money to pay the rent, Ronnie. Do you? (machine whirring) - Hey. - [Man] Hey, you guys. Hey, keep it moving. - Holy shit, man! Where'd you get that? - I hocked my camera. - What? - I hocked my camera! - [Man] Come on, come on. - Hey, man, I knew you'd come through for me. - Yeah, yeah, look, this guy better win tonight, Reno. He's gotta win, 'cause I need that money back. - Don't worry, all right, he's a shoo-in. Hey, so, can you lend me an extra 10 spot, I forgot my lunch. - What? - Hey, I'm just kidding ya. Yeah! - Oh, man. - Loosen up, man, you're getting too tight on me. (chuckles) - [Man] Yo, bro, Dez, what's happening? ♪ Was a friend of ♪ - [Man] How you doing, buddy? - Good to see you, buddy. - You too, you too.

Gonna disappear for a while. - Are you in trouble? - No, just kinda lay low for a while. How's your mom? I mean, how's she doing? - She's doing all right. - [Commentator] Donaldson is punching back. Diaz returns with a right upper-cut. - What's this? - It's for your mom, just take it. - Dez, I can't. - What do you mean you can't? Just take it. Jab, please, let me do this, all right? - I can't, man. - Listen, listen, if you had the money, you'd do the same for me, right? Now take it.

Come on, man, it's smooth as silk. It's just like chop and sticks. Come on, what was I supposed to do? It was a legitimate bet. - You should have picked a legitimate bookie. - Hey, no guts, no glory, Jab. - Yeah, yeah, chop and sticks. (apprehensive music) (distant siren wailing) - [Reno] Shit! - What, what, what is it? - Oh, man, this place scares the shit out of me. There're too many cops. - Don't you chicken on me now, Reno. - Oh, man, I'm just not mentally prepared for this, okay. I mean, we're talking substantial risk factor here. - Look, do you wanna get the money or do you wanna fuck around? Geez, you look like you're dressed for a hijacking. (steam hissing) (lock clangs) You're gonna drive me crazy. - Yeah, well, it's a short drive. (lock thuds) Stay cool. (uneasy music) - I'm all right, all right, go on. - Okay. - Okay. - Bingo. We got it. (tense music) (woman laughing) (chattering) (woman laughing) (chattering) (whirring) - Shut it off, shut it off! (tense music) Scratch, how you doing? See, I told you he'd be here. Working late, huh, Scratch? - Yeah. So, uh, what can I do for you? - Well, uh, we were in the neighborhood. Thought we'd drop in and sort of pick up some money you owe us. - Is that so? - Yeah, yeah, we, uh, we were getting the distinct impression that you were trying to screw us. - You, um, take your chances. - Come on, man, it was a legitimate bet. - So, uh, my name is crime. I don't pay. (laughing) What makes you think I should break a perfect record to pay couple of fuck-ups like you? - Uh, it's, that's, that's a good question, Scratch. Uh, maybe, as a simple gesture of sportsmanship. You know what I'm saying? (scoffs) - You got balls, kid. I like that. But like I said, you, uh, you take your chances. - Let's get the fuck out of here! (gun firing) (dramatic music) (glass shatters) (alarm ringing) (gun firing) Reno, what the hell are you doing? Come on, let's go, go! (intense music) Come on! (sirens wailing) (camera clicks) - [Man] Turn to your right. (police radio chattering) Take your hat off, please. (camera clicks) Turn to your right. (police radio chattering) (camera clicks) (phone ringing) (sighs) - Good morning, Mr. Jablonski. I'm Sergeant Novak. You already know Sergeant Delori. (sighs) What do people call you? Ron, Ronnie, Ronald, what? - Whatever. A lot of people call me Jabber. - Jabber, Jabber. All right, Jabber, you see that guy in there? You ever seen him before? (phone ringing) - Nope. (phone ringing) - How well do you know Desmond Anderson? - We're friends. - Friends? - Yeah, I see him at work, we hang out. We're friends. - Do you know he was trafficking heroin? - Wait a minute, what is this? - Now, just take it easy. Just wanna ask you some questions. - Look, if Dez is in some kind of trouble, it's news to me. So just forget it, okay, guys? - When'd you see him last? - I said forget it! - Hey, listen, pal, we're not here to blow sunshine up your ass. Now, if you think you're doing your friend a favor, it's a little late. - Now, Jabber, I'm sorry to tell you this, but your friend is dead. - What? - Someone used him for target practice. - And, Jabber, you can help us find the killer. (slide projector clicking) You ever hear of the ice pick murders? - I don't know, might have read about it. - In the last two years, these five black guys have all been murdered. They're all well-known drug pushers with the same M.O., shot twice and then stabbed once in the chest. Yesterday, this guy, Curtis King, is brought in here for a couple of overdue parking tickets. Well, it so happens that your friend Desmond Anderson's number was found in his wallet. So we do some checking on that. And we find that two of the parking tickets correspond with the dates and places of two of the murders. I can't hold him on that, it's not solid. But what's interesting is the guy's from out of town. So he could come in, make the connection, take the guy down, drop out of sight. (phone ringing) - So, uh, what's all this gotta do with me? - He's out of reach, so, uh, so we want you to do a little spadework for us. - I don't get it. - Well, for all intents and purposes, this is an arm's-length investigation. We set it up, and you give us what you can. - He's out of our jurisdiction, so we have to make some special arrangements. - Oh, I see. So you want me to get close to this guy. - All you gotta do is keep tabs on him from a distance. - Look, I'm not a cop. I don't know anything about this stuff. - Hey, I don't think we're asking a whole lot here. You like to take pictures, right? - You got the wrong guy, man. - Jabber, I want you to think about Desmond Anderson. Your friend, Dez. And don't forget, we found a gun on your Italian friend. So we're talking armed robbery beef here. My guess is you could do some serious time. We're offering you a way out. (emotional music) - For I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. Then I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all uncleanliness, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you. (emotional music drowns out voice) ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ - As I call them. It is a thing which has been misunderstood. There are many among people who believe that Jesus is indeed, God. (emotional music) (sighs) - Okay. I'll do it. But only if Reno's part of the package. - Uh, I don't think that's possible. - Kid's got a rap sheet as long as my dick. The judge won't go for it. - Then no deal. - Now wait, now wait, wait, wait a minute. All right. I think we could work that out. - He can't know what's going down. We're already sticking our asses out. - And what am I supposed to tell him? - Tell him you're making a contribution to society. - Oh, and what's that supposed to mean? - You don't think we're just gonna cut you guys loose so you can skate away scot-free, do you? (joyless music) - I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for your delinquent friend there. So just think twice about any behavior that could jeopardize our, our little arrangement. All right? Because I can lock you up and swallow the fucking key at any time. - You're the boss. - Just so we understand each other, let's just bag this guy, Jablonski, all right? - Yeah. I guess that's what this is all about, right? - Correct. - What if you got the wrong guy? - Well, it's a possibility. Let's just find out. - [Announcer] This is your last call. - Hey, have a good trip, kid. (reserved music) (train rumbling) - Jesus! How'd they find this place, huh, by helicopter? Community services, man. I'm telling you right now, I ain't feeding peanuts to a bunch of geriatric cases, okay? - You boys for Phoenix House? - You bet. - Uh-huh. Well, come on, let's go.

Nice, uh, piece of machinery you got here, Rolley. - Yeah, I put it all together in spare parts. - No kiddin'. - [Rolley] Yep, hop in. (energetic rock music) (Rolley hooting) - Hey, Rolley, where's the fire? - Ah, don't worry, ain't no cop shop here for miles. You never get tickets up this way. You know, I've had my share of head-on collisions, but never get tickets anymore. I haven't had a ticket since, uh, geez, when was it? Must have been 1955. (energetic rock music drowns out Rolley) Oh, geez, the stuff will get rusty if you don't keep it running over here. (steam hissing) (breathing heavily) (clanking) (peaceful country music) Your friend's got the gambling bug, eh? (chuckles) - Yeah, he's a chemist, all right. - A chemist? - Oh, yeah. He's the only guy I know that can make shit out of money. (laughing) - You're a pistol, son. (laughing) - So, uh, tell me, Rolley, you ever heard of Curtis King? - Oh, sure. Yeah, Curtis is the kind of guy who'd leave his mark on you. Usually with a razor. - What do you mean? - He runs the flag races up here. - Flag races? - You never heard of flag races? Oh, Jesus, you will. (laughing) (mysterious music) (Rolley whistling cheerily) Well, welcome to Phoenix House. Come on, you guys, geez. (Rolley chuckling) (Rolley whistling cheerily) - [Man] You boys know why you're here? - No, sir. - You boys are here because you aren't believers.

He came in and Dez handed him a locker key. - How do you know it was a locker key? - He dropped it, I saw him pick it up. - So they were doing some business together, but that doesn't mean he blew him away. Where were these taken? - King, he, uh, he runs this, uh, horse race thing at night. It's like a gambling den for a lot of high rollers. And from what I've seen, somebody's making a shit houseful of money there. - [Novak] Who's the old man? - I don't know. No relation.

It's a great feeling. (horse snorting) - Ever race him? - No. But, uh, well, I used to say I never would. My father gave me that horse. - I think you're right. - [Jessica] What? - I mean, not to race him. - Yeah. - So, uh, what's with the water, anyway? (chuckles) - None of your business. - You don't trust me, do you? - I know why you're here. - Well, don't worry about it. I'm not an ax murderer or anything. (Jessica sighs) - I'm not worried.

(clattering) (laughing) - [Jessica] It's okay. - I'm sorry, I'll pick it up. - Oh, my goodness. - I'm sorry, ma'am. - Uh, Aunt Babs, this is the character I was telling you about, Ron Jablonski. - You're that city boy, aren't you? - Yes, ma'am. (slurping) (laughing) It's good popcorn. - Boy, you'd be a cheap date. - Yeah. So, uh, I guess I must have left a great impression on your aunt, huh? - Mm, don't worry about it. She hates all city people. - Oh, good. - So where'd you get a name like Jablonski? - I don't know, why? - It doesn't suit you. (distant train horn blaring) - [Jabber] Well, what have we got here? - You fish? - Yeah, I used to go with the old man, why? - Oh, yeah, we should go sometime. - Yeah, sure. Let me see if I still got it. (pole zipping) - Ow, ow! - Oh, Jesus Christ. - Don't worry about it. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, here. - It's okay, don't worry, it's just my jacket. Don't worry about it. - Yeah, wait. - Thanks. - Me and the old man used to do a lot of combat missions. (laughing) - Yeah, I can see that. - Be still. - So you got a girlfriend, Jablonski? - No, used to. - What happened? - Too many miles, too many smiles, I guess. - Ah, hmm, oh yeah.

(whip cracking) Come on now. - [Cody] Come on now! (whip cracking) - [Curtis] God dammit! (horse whinnying) (whip cracking) - [Cody] Would you look at that? (Cody laughing) (whip cracking) (horse whinnying) - [Curtis] Now, that's what we've been looking for. - [Cody] Pay attention. Come on, yeah. Yeah, that's my girl. - Yes, woo! (horse whinnying) (whip cracking) Woo, that's beautiful! (whip cracking) Yeah, ha! (whip cracking) - [Cody] Now, Desmond should see this. This is the bomb! (whip cracking) - Woo!

(chuckles) That's a meal ticket, brother. - Looking good, Cody, looking good. (mysterious music) - They say he's a real local hero, you know? He saved a couple of kids from the fire when the mill burned down or something. - Well, the local hero is always the least likely suspect, but he's the most likely to get away with it. Who's the other guy? - Cody Cardinal. He's the horseman. Works the horses, runs the races. - Definitely looks the part. So, it's one or the other or both. But I think we're on the right track. - Yeah, but what I don't get is, I mean, why target five small-time movers? If you're gonna kill someone for their dope, I mean, why not go for bigger fish? Make it worth your while. - Maybe he didn't want to shop around. - But Dez was just a nickel-and-dimer. - Or maybe he thought they were easy targets. - Where's the payoff? There's no payoff here. - Maybe he's just a ruthless bastard. Did you ever think of that? (birds chirping) (Cody laughing) (horse whinnying) - [Cody] Right into the basket, now. Now come on, baby, come on. - That is a good looking... - Hey, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing? That's not your horse. (chuckles) - Well, I'm afraid you're working on old information there, my friend. - Jabber, Jabber. It's all right. - Now, who are you? - I work here. - Hya. - Stop. - Hey, you don't have to do that. - Come on! That kind of stuff builds character. - Hya! - Curtis, stop it. (grunting) (horse whinnying) (tense music) - Well, you're sure full of piss and vinegar, fella. He'd tear you a new asshole. - Curtis, leave him alone. - Okay, Cody, enough fun and games. (Cody groaning) (chuckles) Well, anyway, you're more than welcome to come on up and watch her run a few. She's a winner. - I'll think about it. (horse whinnying) - [Curtis] You know, up here, we tend to talk friendly to people. - Yeah? Well, I'm not from up here. - Well, then while you're here it might be in your interest to be my friend. - I got all the friends I need right now, thanks. (horse whinnying) - Suit yourself. Bye, partner. (horse whinnying) (Curtis laughs) Grab the bottle, Cody. Let's celebrate. - I needed the money. (engine rumbling) (both yelling) - Whoa! Yeah! (both laughing) (Jabber laughing) (thunder rumbling) Yeah. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (sensitive music) - Choose your weapon, partner. - What is this place? - The old station house. In its heyday, this here was the best booze can in town. - This place here? - Yep. God, if these walls could talk, they'll tell you. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) - How long has it been out of commission? - Close to 10 years now, I guess. Ron Brown and Jimmy Larson squared off right where you are. - Over what? Who'd buy the next round? - No. (chuckles) Over Susie Squire. - That's even better. - It's kind of romantic, don't you think? Don't you ever wish you could just go back and make everything the way it was? So, who's gonna break? - Sh.

A lot of traveling salesmen have told me that. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. (chuckles) Mm. - So, uh, are you gonna stay here forever? - Forever is a long time. Maybe I'll go to the big city and become rich and famous and buy myself a flashy red dress. - Then why can't you leave town with me? - Why don't you stay? What do you do when you're not hanging around the girls' washroom? - Not much. - Come on, what are you up to, Jablonski? (chuckles) - What do you mean? - I saw all those pictures and stuff of Curtis over there. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. (sighs) - All I can say is he's in a lot of trouble. - What kind of trouble? - The worst kind. (mysterious music) (disc jockey chattering) (Curtis laughs) - Mm. You better watch those things, they're bad luck. Molly, bring my, uh, my friend here a beer. - No, thanks, uh, I got one. (man laughing) (camera clicking) So, tell me, what would it take to get Jessie's horse back? - This horse business has sort of shook you up, hasn't it? - Well, everybody's got a price. - Well, I'm not everybody. Most people around here know that. But, uh, I do appreciate the offer. - Look, let's cut the bullshit. You don't like me, do you? - I don't like that tone of voice. - Well, I'm gonna get Jessie's horse back. Whether you like me or not. - Now, you don't want to do that. (distant bottle shattering) - May be. - You don't want to go creating conditions you can't live with. (uneasy music) It might be self-destructive. - What are you gonna do, man? Kill me? Right here? - If you say so. - Do you wanna dance? - Yeah, sure. - You spread yourself pretty thin, don't ya? - Well, I'll take my chances. - Oh, that ain't healthy. (relaxed rock music) - I'll warn you. I'm sort of an unconventional slow dancer. - Okay. Whoa, what are you doing? - Do you know what I like to do to this kind of music? - No, what? - Fuck. - Really? Takes you a while to come out of your shell, doesn't it? (moaning) - Oh, let's go someplace. - I can't. - Don't you find me attractive? - Oh, yeah. - Didn't you get my note? - Um, yeah, but. (tense music) Shit! Jessie! Jessie, wait a minute. - Forget it. - Look, there was nothing going on in there. - Just forget it, all right? - Hold on a second. - Hey, there's no contract, okay? - Look, she's just a kid. She just got carried away. - Listen, you do what you want, okay? You do your job, that's fine, but don't play games with me. - Wait a minute. I may be wrong here, but I thought we were working on something. - Yeah, well, you were wrong. - Oh, so that's it, huh? Just like that? - I trusted you. - Oh, Jessie. What do you want me to say? - I think you've said enough. - Jessie. You gotta believe me. - Save it, okay? Save it for someone else. (sighs) - Great. (laughing) - Now, that's beautiful. You are gonna get a rude awakening, my friend. - Fuck you. (laughing) - Now don't sweet-talk me, that never works. You give me any static, I'm gonna step on you. (insects chirping) (door hinges squeaking) (birds chirping) (rattling) (engine revving) (birds chirping) (eerie music) (horse whinnying) - How you doin', Walter? (mysterious music) (whinnying) (mysterious music) (neighing) (ominous music) (whinnying) - Now I don't know what crazy ideas are fermenting in that little mind of yours. But I'm not sparring with you anymore. If you don't wanna find yourself in a shipment of cat food, you better back off. (tense music) A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. (tense music) (uneasy music) (hooves clopping) (thuds) - You're late. - He's doping the horses, that son of a bitch is doping the fucking horses! - How do you know? - I found this in one of his stalls. You test that, you'll find it contains the dope we're looking for. Don't you see? He was doping the horses to fix the races. That was the payoff! - This is good stuff, kid. We're getting closer. - Closer? - Yeah, I've gotta run this through the lab. - Well, how long will that take? - Not more than a day or two. - Day or two? Are you kidding? How close do you gotta be? - Hey, I, I don't make the rules. - But we've got probable cause! Why can't we just bag the guy? Listen, I don't know how much longer I can keep a lid on this fucking thing. - Just take it easy, kid. You gotta stay on top of this. Because if you go down, I go down. And I, I can't let that happen. - Okay, what are we gonna do now? - We're not gonna jump in and get in over our heads. - But I'm all alone out there! - I'm not gonna jeopardize this investigation because of your inexperience. - Look, I did not ask for this thing. You gave it to me! The fact is, you guys are dragging your ass! - The fact is, you wanna settle a score, but there's more to it than that. - That son of a bitch killed my best friend. - That doesn't give you the right to declare open season. I got four other bodies out there, pal! So you just get a hold of yourself. I can't move on him now, anyway, because even if I can tie him to the dope, I can't tie him to the killings unless he confesses! We need the gun. You get the gun, I can put him away. And if he's kept it this long, there's a chance he's still got it. So get the gun. (fluttering) (horse whinnying) - Some big stakes out here. Could be a big win situation. - Yeah, so, what's the problem? - Only got one plug left. She's been taking three. Tell me that horse is a goddamn junkie. - Yeah, well, you let me worry about that. Can she win? - She ran us three wins last night. We're running her into the ground. - And I said, can she win? - I don't know. The point is, this stuff is poison. In the long run, you're losing your best horses. - Yeah, well, you don't tell me what the fucking point is. The point is to be at the finish line. You see this? This is the point. You understand? Go ahead, use the, use the fuse box. Personally, I think it's a wicked little device, but who am I to say? (machine whirring) (uneasy music) (tape scratching) (crowd applauding) - [Announcer] Now, listen up, folks. Our post time is gonna be real soon. So let's that cash in here. Our odds right now running five to one on Black. We got two to one on Brown. Three to one on Black. 10 to one on Dapple. - [Curtis] Cody. - [Announcer] Four to one on Brown. - [Curtis] Look who we've got here now. - Mr. P. - Pleased to see ya. - Looks like we're gonna be robbed again tonight. (laughing) - Place your bets! (laughing) - Let's get it on the road, folks! (dramatic music) - [Announcer] Frank Baker. If you're not Frank, get this to him, Frank, could you move that pickup? You are blocking the washroom. Thank you, Frank. (gun fires) (crowd cheering) (hooves clopping) - Go! (electricity crackling) (hooves clopping) - Go! Go! (hooves clopping) - Come on! (electricity crackling) (hooves clopping) (electricity crackling) Come on! (electricity crackling) (hooves clopping) (cheering) (electricity crackling) (hooves clopping) (dark music) (electricity crackling) - Oh, no! - Get down there, Cody! (dark music) (horse groaning) - Oh, God! (gloomy music) Easy, boy. It's okay. It's okay. (horse snorting) - [Jabber] Is he okay? - He's fine. (horse snorting) - Can I talk to you for a minute? - There's nothing to talk about. - Listen, Jessie, what are you doing with this guy? He's bad news. You said so yourself. - Please go. - Oh, for Christ's sake, will you give me five minutes? - Look, I don't want to talk about it! (sighs) So please leave. - All right, fine, do what you want. Come on, Jessie. - Stop it, leave me alone! - Well, you just won't take no for an answer, will ya? - Look, this has got nothing to do with you, all right? - I think the lady made her point crystal clear! So why don't you just move on before you get hurt? - You know, I am sick and tired of your John Wayne bullshit! (tense music) - Curtis, put the gun away. - But you're pushing pretty hard, boy. I don't know who in the hell you think you are but you don't belong here. - Curtis, leave him alone. (tense music) (horse snorting) (gate rattling) Stop it! (horse whinnying) - Now you'd better decide whose fool you are before you find out you're everybody's fool. (tense music) Oh, you'll side up with me sooner or later. - I'm taking my horse out of here. - You're doing no such thing. - But you said-- - I lied. - You bastard. (gasping) - Only cream and bastards rise, honey. - Yeah, Sergeant. Look, I can't take this anymore. I gotta do something. I gotta move on this guy. - [Novak] Jabber, now just calm down. - I know, you want me to sit tight, but I can't. I just can't! - [Novak] Jabber, we wait the guy out, then we can nail him. - You don't understand, I'm buried in this thing! - [Novak] You gotta trust me on this, kid. - No. I, I can't. - [Novak] Look, you blow your cover and someone's gonna get hurt. - I don't care! - [Novak] All right, look. We both wanna nail this guy, all right? So, we've gotta keep our heads clear. Okay, you're real upset now. I just want you to go home and get some sleep. Then when I meet with you tomorrow, I'll bring a search warrant. (handset clattering) (sighs) (apprehensive music) (owl hooting) (laughing) - Hey, boy! (laughing) (tires screeching) (tense music) - Now, what kind of welcome was that? (tense music) And where were you going? - Nowhere. - Well, you got that right. - I missed you yesterday, my friend. - Yeah, well, I was busy. - You're not a welcher, are ya? - No, hey, I got the money! - You got the money? - Yeah, I got it. But not, not on me, you know, I, I don't got it, but I got it. - Where is it? - Hey, it's safe, man, what do you think? I'm gonna carry that amount of cash with me with guys like him hanging around, eh? - I don't have time for your bullshit. - Okay, wait a minute. Just give me until tomorrow and I'll just drop it off, okay? - I'm afraid that's not good enough, Matthew. You can't be trusted. - Listen, man, I can get it, okay? I'll go get it, all right? What are you doing, eh? - I'm just gonna try this on for size. (laughs) - Oh, listen, man! I got the fucking money, all right? - Situations like this distress me! Matthew, you know what happens when I get distressed? I act out a character. - Listen, I said I can get it, all right? - I mean, usually, I'm a happy guy, and a happy guy should be happy, right? (tense music) (owl hooting) Get up there. (Cody grunting) - Come on, Jesus Christ, man. (Cody grunting) - Move! - Jesus Christ, man! - I'm sorry, Matthew. You've gotta pay the piper. - I swear to God, I'll borrow it, okay? Don't, all right? Please, don't! - Say good night, Matthew. (breathing heavily) Say it. Just say it. Say it! Say it! - No! (clangs) (tense music) (splashing) (both laughing) - Must be cold. (groaning) (splashing) (engine revving) (tires screeching) (Cody hooting) (panting) (coughing) (bell ringing) - [Dispatcher] Unit 38 is on the way. - [Woman] Room 22. - [Dispatcher] Control call 357. - [Dispatcher] Agent 70, come in. - [Nurse] I don't think the poor old man ever made it to bed. He was like this when I came in this morning. - [Paramedic] You got him on two? - [Paramedic] Yeah, it's okay. - Yeah, old man Wilkinson. He used to be the town pharmacist. That old ticker just went. (buckle clicks) - [Paramedic] Ready? - [Paramedic] I got him. Excuse me, please, sir. - [Nurse] Poor old guy. - [Dispatcher] Now 3954, pick up. (mysterious music) - [Novak Voiceover] Who's the old man? (ambulance siren wailing) (mysterious music) (mysterious music) (gun firing) (gun clicking) (dark gloomy music) (horses whinnying) (dark gloomy music) (gun firing) (horses whinnying) (dark gloomy music) - Whoa, hey. (distressed breathing) - I've been looking all over for you, man. - Yeah, well, you know, I've been in and out. - What, what happened here? - What, this? Snake bit me. (chuckles) - What, you, uh, you leaving the country or something? (sighs) - Oh, I'm in a lot of trouble, Jab. I'm in a lot of trouble, man! Nothing seems to be working out. - What happened? - I got myself into a serious jackpot. I know, Reno does it again, right? But I can't help it, man. Everything just sort of snowballed. I mean, I really don't know what to do, man, because I told the guy I don't have that kind of money, you know. - Who? - This Curtis guy. He's got a hard on for me or something. The guy belongs in a zoo, I'm telling ya. - Reno, don't worry about it, okay? - Jab, these fucking guys are gonna kill me. - Reno, you don't owe them nothing. You understand? You don't owe them a nickel. - What are you talking about? - Reno, these guys are the guys that did Dez. - What? How do you know that? - They set him up for this. You see, you've been screwed, man. Those races are fixed. They win when they wanna win and they lose when they wanna lose because they dope the horses. They took this from Dez. I found it in old man Wilkinson's room. He was cutting this stuff for Curtis. - So, that means I don't gotta pay. - That's right. But you gotta stay here and don't move. That old man just gave us King's balls on a platter. (uneasy music) - Your boyfriend's gettin' out of hand. He seems determined to piss me off. I know he's not a cop. What does he want? - How should I know? I don't know. I don't. - If you say so. I'm not about to piddle around with some city faggot with big ideas. Now, this won't be a pretty sight. (Jessica breathing heavily) And I don't wanna do it. But I want some answers. - Curtis, no! - You tell me then. - Please, no, he said that you're in some kind of trouble. That's all I know. (breathing heavily) (water dripping) - Sergeant? Novak? - [Curtis] He ain't here. - Where is he? - He, uh, stepped out. (tense music) For the duration. (Jessica whimpering) Now, he's got a gun there that could blow a hole through an engine, turn her off like a light switch. All I want is the package. (tense music) - What? - You heard me, it's simple. Sweet Jessie here for the package. And whatever you do, don't fuck with me now. - Let her go. - Package. - Let her go. - Let her go, Cody. - You just put that bag on the table, boy. Good boy. (Jessica gasps) (tense music) (sighs) - My friend, you underestimate me. The problem with you is you're reckless. You just steamroll into things hell-bent for election. Without taking a good look at the consequences. (chuckling) So much for fearless gallantry. - Well, say good night, boy. - [Jessica] No! (grunts) (gun fires) (screams) - Drop the gun! Drop the gun! (tense music) - Cody. Don't do it. Don't! I said, don't do it. - See you later, Curtis. (breathing heavily) (gun firing) (grunts) - [Officer] Watch your back! (thuds) (police radio chattering) (intense music) (gun clicks) - Try it, asshole. (intense music) (siren wailing) - [Dispatcher] Patrol call 657. (siren wailing) (knocking) - Officer. Can I trouble you for a cigarette? (siren wailing) Thank you, sir. A light? (siren wailing) (groaning) (dramatic music) (siren wailing) (tires screeching) (snarling) (groaning) (clattering) (siren wailing) (debris clattering) (flames roaring) (touching music) (dog barking) (Jessica laughing) (Jessica yelps) (both laughing) - Oh. You're drunk. - I am, so? (laughing) Honey, I'm home! - So, you wanna roll in the hay? - May as well. I've lost any self-respect I might have had. And you have, too. (both laughing) (Jessica moaning) (glass shattering) - Remember me? (off-hook tone beeping) You feel this, do ya? All it takes is a teeny-weeny push, sweetheart. Just a pinch, that's all. And you can thank your boyfriend here for that 'cause he wants to be some fucking hero. - Please, don't. - Shut up! No one does what you did to me. You understand? Now you're looking up a dead horse's ass, pal. (dreadful music) Come on. You wanna go the distance with me, my friend, you're fucking playing for keeps. The only thing that's gonna straighten you out is the tail end of a bullet. Oh, you think you're pretty clever, don't ya? I should've put you to sleep a long time ago. (dark music) (breathing heavily) But I'm afraid that you just met your maker. (thudding) (gun firing) (bulb shattering) (horses whinnying) (gun firing) (bullets ricocheting) - [Jabber] Reno! (gun firing) (horse whinnying) - Hey, you fuckhead! You fired all six shots, I counted. (soft dark music) - You counted wrong. (gun fires) (grunts) (glass shattering) (groaning) (breathing heavily) (hinges creaking) (soft apprehensive music) (metal clanking) (heavy breathing drowns out voices) (soft apprehensive music) (exhales sharply) (soft apprehensive music) (tense music) (gun firing) (bullets ricocheting) (gun fires) (Curtis screaming) (gun firing) (Jabber grunts) (energetic evil music) (gun fires) (both grunting) (punches thudding) (groaning) (ominous music) (shears clicks) (groaning) (gun fires) (horses whinnying) (Curtis groaning) (gun fires) (horse whinnying) (Curtis groaning) (gun fires) (gun fires) (dreadful music) (Jabber panting) (birds chirping) - Woo! Look at this guy. I do all the rescuing and he ends up with the fucking girl? (Jabber chuckling) Hey, hello. Story of my life. - Come here, let's take a look at you. - Hey, man, it's just a flesh wound. It's gonna be a nice scar to brag about, you know. - No guts, no glory. - You got that right. So, are you sure about this? - Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll stick around for a while, see if I can stir up some action. - Whoa, man, I had enough of that shit, okay? - I bet. Here. - What's this? - It's for you, open it later. (touching music) Well, take care of yourself, huh? - I will. - Hey!
