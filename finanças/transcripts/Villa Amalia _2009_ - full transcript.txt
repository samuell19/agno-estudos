Villa Amalia - That house really interests you. - Yes. - For a burglay? - Exactly. Don't you recognize me? l recognize you. Eliane. Eliane Hidelstein. True. - What? - "True," that was my name before. And you? l'm Georges. Georges Roelh. You were just a kid then. Remember? In Brittany. Are you okay? l drew a blank. - l've changed more than you. - "No," that's not it. Maybe just a little bit. You couldn't recognize me. You were busy spying. "True," l was spying. On the man l live "with," Thomas. Let's change the subject. As you like. A drink? Tea. You're no longer Eliane Hidelstein? No. Your new name? Ann Hidden. Ann. Double "n," no e. My music name. Still playing piano? lt's my profession. Do you compose? ln a way. l'm glad l found you again. l feel like bread. Sure. With what? Just bread. With butter and jam. l have bread. Butter from Brittany. Ma doesn't like salted butter. You live with your mother? Remember her? "Yes," of course. She was like a faiy. She died. Eleven days ago. l'm sory. lt's not your fault. lt hasn't sunk in yet. l came to put things in order. l'm selling this house. l don't like this town. lsn't it miraculous? Meeting here in Choisy-Le-Roi... like mo ghosts. lsn't Ma's tea is good? Delicious. Was she still a great cook? Always. "Remarried," then a widow again. But she "cooked," even for herself. lt was crazy. All "day," evey day. Ma was something. Must you call me tu? l always called you tu. lt seems strange. lt'd be stranger if l stopped. You're not "serious," Eliane. "Ann-Eliane," l've known you forever. True. Do you miss... your mother's cooking? Not really. lt was oppressive. Now l can lose weight. lt's nearby. You should come. Great restaurants. Eating alone is amul. You can't imagine. l've always enjoyed it. Really? l hate it. You eat so fast... Not me. People stare. True. You oRen say true. "Yes," true. l dislike eating alone. Will you join me? Good night. l was worried sick. l leR you ten messages. Concerned about me? Where were you? Shut up. l'm leaving. It's over. What? We are going to break up. - Why? - Think. Why would we break up? There are no whys. You're leaving. Now. lt's late. True... Look at me. l don't see much anymore. - You love someone else? - Do you? Are you asleep? Ann? - l love you. - Get out! You can'tjust leave. It's been 15 years. - We need to talk. - No point! You can'tjust start over! Am l waking you? Yes. l'll call you back. l'm abrupt. Don't be upset. l'm not. "Georges," l wanted to tell you... l'm glad we met up again. So am "l," Ann-Eliane. You know? Georges... l'd like to "talk," for real. Let's "talk," for real. You do the talking. l'm going to Brittany. Next weekend. To spend the Twelth Night with Mother. l couldn't care less! Talk about yourself. What's going on? l know you. What's going on? lmagine a front yard in Choisy. A yard with a rose bush. Further "on," a woman is waiting. She gives you her lips. You kiss her. So that's it? lt's nothing... What's there to do? Nothing. Move out. You have to leave. lt's my "apartment," my life. Our life. l love you. Not that word... or l'll go! You can't stop me from saying it. l want to sell my apartment. We'll fill out the paperwork in your name. Mrs...? Georges... Mrs. Georges. - l quit. - Quit "what," Ann? Concerts. Evemhing. How can you? There's "Germany," England... The album too. lt's over. "Hello," Mrs. Georges. You're hard to find. Your name's nowhere. True... Come in. Recent paintjob. A year ago. Good. The insulation is up to par? Repainted and reinsulated last year. l want it sold as fast as possible. Selling fast is good but you mustn't undersell. "No," but fast. Sales are down this time ofyear. Can l sell the furniture as well? lt's harder. Better to sell separately. Especially for the pianos. l know that. l want you to sell the rest. How are you? - No kisses. l'm sick. - l will an_ay. Do you ride it? lt was my friend's. He died. l'm sory. lt's not your fault either. When did it happen? Two years ago. Did you really love him? l loved "him," period. l loved him. Can l use it? lfyou like. This way. Want to go out? The idea of eating with you brought tears to my eyes. "Silly," isn't it? l wasn't cying but l had tears. You're vey sentimental. You think so? lf it means l don't like eating "alone," l guess l am. Notjust Thomas. l'm leaving evemhing. l want a clean break. Except from you. l need you. - Why leave evemhing? - l don't know. To put an end to my former life. - You're a bit deranged. - "Yes," that's it. l don't know how l'll go about it. Be my only "friend," okay? Why? There are no whys! Keep the secret for me. l love secrets. Not secrets. The secret. Pain in the ass! "Yes," l'll keep the secret. - You okay? - Yes! l made risotto. l've eaten. Excuse "me," l'm tired. Come to England. l'm going to London. Back next Sunday. You come back the 8th? "Yes," the 8th. Come on Friday. - The 6th? - "Yes," the 6th. A short holiday. - No. - whn - l don't want to. - That's no answer. And l can't. Why can't you? l have too much to do. Just for a weekend. This may be the busiest week of my life. Just a weekend! No You always say no. True. ls it because of... what l did? Not even. From now "on," l'm saying no. "Coffee," please. Thanks "Ann," are you there? l said l quit evemhing. Just cancel. We'll work out the details. l'll cover your losses. Philippe? l'm sory. lt's exactly what they're looking for. They want to come visit. ls tomorrow morning okay? No lt has to be before the end ofthe week. Tomorrow but not before 11 l sleep. PerFect. See you tomorrow. Any restaurants nearby? No idea. l'm hungy. l'm vey hungy. You're not hungy? No l'm hungy. l wish things could be like before. l love "you," you know. - Look over there. - Look at me instead. l feel "amul," you know. l feel really amul. Let's just go there. Come "on," you can eat. lfthey want "it," when can we close? The sales agreement? At the beginning ofthe month. The lth? The "lth," ifyou like. We can discuss this with them. They'll be here any minute. Put them in my mailbox. Here they are. Mr. and Mrs. Dermal! Excuse me! lt's not so easy. That's not how it works. How does it work? Large sums require notice. Shall l close my account? They're "rules," madam. Mademoiselle. Two days notice on sums over 8000 euros. Someone's waiting. Five minutes. Here's what we'll do. l'll take 1000 now. l'll leave enough for "taxes," advance "payments," direct debit... We'll do the math. Right now? lsn't this a bank? For the rest l want a check. l want to sell it. Not driving well? lt "is," but l want to sell it. As fast as possible. Why? ls it really your business? l found ajob in the USA. Lucky you! l don't know if l'm lucky. - Ajoint P.O. box. - Will you pick up your mail? No Will your husband or spouse? No You have to fill out this form. l have some questions. Don't be uncomfortable. Okay? Why uncomfortable? Can l put money in your bank account? l'd dislike that. Not to help "you," but to hide. An invisible account. Okay. Forget it. l want to buy the small house from you. To write my music. l need a shack. A hut. A hut? You want it? Take it. No need to buy it. We'll see. l'll redo it. l'll fix it up. l'll do it in the blink of an eye. Go "on," be my guest. This is all good news. You never said. You like it here? "No," not vey much. l have a secret. Another? The same. Promise you'll keep it. Look into my eyes. l'm selling my apartment. You're not acting rashly? Because ofwhat you saw? l couldn't care less. l saw nothing... "Yes," you. We're closing in a week. And your guy... does Thomas know? "No," he can't know. No one can. Just you. No one knows you exist. Not even my mother. You'll leave me too... Yes. l'll come back. You're not nice. - True... - "Yes," it is. And your brand new hut? l'll come back. You're crazy. l'll have money but l want no address. l need your account for my name to disappear. l set up a joint P.O. box in our names. l used your name for my apartment. l felt better. You can have my name as well. lt's hard to vanish nowadays. l wanted to go to New "York," but European airlines give Washington passenger lists. Did you know? No With cell phones they can locate you. So no cell. No email address. No credit cards. Where will you go? Into space? Tangiers is a good place to vanish. Then into the desert. Lot of money. l overpaid for the Steingraeber. Really? Why? l admire your work. We'll take all three on the 5th? l'd prefer right now. You won't play anymore? l will. Without your piano? With "others," or without. Are you tired? This goes here. l remembered. Eliane? l'm here. What's wrong? Are you not well? We're all meeting up tonight. - l'll say hi. - She's asleep. She wasn't the queen. Are you "okay," Mother? What are you doing? You want some coffee? l'm going. l'll call you. "Goodbye," Mother. Here. l'll go deposit it. l'll need it for my trip. ls Silvy doing okay? Why not go to Brittany? Out ofthe question. Never. What are you doing? What got into you? That was stupid of me. You'll come back? Of course. Forget that. l want to cancel my service. One new message. Ann? You shut offthe phones. lt's sunny in London. l hate this city. We'll never speak again. l'm talking to myself. You want me "dead," so l'm dead. l've been stupid recently. l was always stupid with you. You unsettle me. l don't know you. l never "entered," l know. You put on a lock. The lock may be for you too. l hope not. Love you. l'd offer you coffee but no machine. No electricity either. True. "Here," it's not damaged. So keep it. You're leaving? Yes Where to? Just leaving. Good for you. Good "luck," ma'am. Are you okay? l'm in "Tangiers," Georges. - Nice weather? - Beautiful! l'm thinking of "you," Ann-Eliane. Last station, please get offthe bus. - Thanks. - Thanks. "Passport," please. Where are you going? ltaly. Thanks. - To you. - Thanks. - Thanks bye. - Bye Thanks How do you do. lt was my father's. Now he's dead. Why are you sad for my "father," signora? He lived his life. He's my "father," not yours. Cy for your own. That's enough. - Are you French? - Yes lt's obvious. That house... lt's no longer a house. Does it belong to you? lt belongs to the mountain. Get going now. l have things to do! Aunty. Aunty. Go "away," signorina! Leave me in peace! Why are you speaking like this? Why scream? My father built the villa for his "sister," Amalia. He really loved her. But Amalia died. He decided to live in it himself. He lived with his grief until his death. l didn't know. l'm sory. You're not to blame for the death of my relatives. You must feel lonely. "Yes," vey lonely. Sometimes it scares me. l want to cy. But deep "down," l like it. l think l'm happy. "No," not you! When people are "happy," it scares me. l found a house l want to rent. l didn't know l could love a place so wholly. And your hut? Later. Come back "fast," Ann-Eliane. We miss you. Why don't you come? To Tangiers? No! To my island. Are you okay? "Yes," so far so good. Why don't you live here? lt's a beautiful place. Legs are for "bodies," and "memories," for hearts. What's your "name," signorina? Ann. My name is Amalia. Like your mother? Like my "aunt," not my mother. So you call me Amalia. l'll call you Anna. l have to ask my brother Filosseno if he has the key. "No," he'll have thrown it away. l'm sure my father would have liked you a lot. That's nice to hear. You can't imagine. Why? My father didn't love me. ls your father dead? He leR. When l was little. You have children? My God. You'll understand if l don't come visit you oRen. So you agree? Carlo! Look! A woman! Do you need help? Signora! She's not moving? Signora! Signora! l have a cramp. Carlo! She has a cramp. Thank you. l'm embarrassed. lt's absurd. What got into me to swim out so far? What's your name? Giulia. And yours? Carlo... "Charles," as you say. lt's funny but you both saved my life. Who is it that owes us her life? Ann. Anna. You should rest up a bit. Wine for eveyone. Where did you get that face? lt comes from another world. l'm cold. Can we go inside? My father played in an orchestra in Romania. He was my teacher until he leR. From the age of4 to "6," we did 2 to 3 hours of piano a day. My brother cried at the door so l'd come with him. He hated music. And then? l don't know. l can't remember. l sulked for a year aRer he leR. Don't speak French. l understand nothing. lt's too strange a language. And then? Nicolas died. - Nicolas? - My little brother. And then life... life went "on," as before. My mother saw that... l was composing constantly. Always jotting down "melodies," "music," hymns... She encouraged me. Why am l telling you this? We saved your "life," right? True! On vacation with your family? No Not on vacation? No And no family. lt's not bad not having one. lt's ideal. Have you been together long? We're no longer together. l don't love him anymore. And we don't sleep together. lt's too intimate to be seen "asleep," isn't it? Yes l found a place. A place of my own. Want to see? Ok! Are you coming? Dead to the world. Eliane? This really isn't Tangiers. Hard to find? l could have used a sherpa. What is this place? Whatever you want. There's a girl... "Yes," Guilia. Can l get settled? Go on. Make yourself at home. What are you up to? Come out of hiding. - Bye - Bye Ann l've gotten too old. l know "it," but sometimes l forget. Too old for the cute guys. So they have their fun. - We'll call the police. - "No," forget it. They're right to have fun. We drank a lot. lt was a blast. Brothers and "sisters," as paradoxical as it "seems," from "death," life springs forth. The Christians we have been since baptism imitate Christ who also dies in order to give life and to bear fruit. May the Lord be with you. And with your Spirit. She suffered. Now she's in peace. She could barely speak. She said... Don't tell me. Thanks for evemhing. Someone's here for you. Who? Come "on," l'm hungy. l love lobster. You "know," some ofyour pieces are beautiful. Why didn't you keep my name? Because you leR. l'm like that. l run away. "Yes," l know. l run away too. Music allows you to nibble eveywhere. Even to eat well. There's always a "funeral," a wedding. As for "me," l kill time. l fill up space. But "you," you make music. Not true. True... but no matter. Musicians... like you or me can beg for coins by crouching on any bridge in the world. ln my life it's only filling up hours with painstaking work that has kept me "afloat," more or less. When l say "hours," l'm bragging. lt's half hour by half hour that l attack time. So l really am your daughter. You really would be ifyou were as lonely as l am. Why do you think that? What do you know of me? Don't scream. l hate that. Your mother screamed. l can scream if l want to! You should have "stayed," given some sign of life. You could have called "Mother," sent a card for Christmas. - Or Rosh Hashana.l-Remember Rosh Hashana? You could have acted normally. What you're saying isn't true. l never knew normal "people," my daughter. Easy on the my daughter. You never saw me. There is no normal existence. l hear you there. My "daughter," you still have things to hear. The real dead "people," l betrayed by marying your mother. lt wasn't her fault. She "screamed," you "screamed," eveyone screamed at me. l'm too much of a musician and... l'm Jewish. l can't stand screams. You still have things to hear. There was no one for me. You and your mother and your brother couldn't fill that void. You were... too alive. lt wasn't a baby or a "child," a flow of Catholic tears or a good cook that l needed. You "know,"l really couldn't survive your birth or the death ofyour brother. "Quiet," Papa. l think you're hurting me. Then l'll stop. That's not my purpose. Let's go to "sleep," my daughter. You want to sleep at the house? Out ofthe question! l hate that house. l don't want to see the curtains she embroidered for each window. - What are you looking for? - "Nothing," my daughter. l admire you. l buy what you do. your second album. - You could have told me. - Not on your life! Stop talking. Let me have a good cy. You see... You really are French. Your mother's daughter. A real Catholic. And you like a good cy. You're crazy! Don't go in! Why not? He'll catch his death. Come "on," Eliane. lt's been 40 years! Come on. Where's your Italian? She went back. Let's go. l loved it when we first came here. We had veal "stew," remember? Want it again? lt's "silly," but it's my best memoy ever. What do you think ofyour hut? lt's perFect. ltjust needs you. When will you be back? Not right away. Not right away is never for me. Are you vey sick? Remember when l kissed you? Andrew Litvack C.M.C.
