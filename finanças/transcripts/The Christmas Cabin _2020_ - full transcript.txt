Come on. Ah! Hi, can you hear me? Hey, Sis. Yeah, I can hear you great. - Loud and clear. - Oh, hi. So, are you going to be able to make it? Tell me you changed your mind. No. Josh, stop it. You're killing me. Come on. Charlet misses her pattycakes. Auntie Sammy! Aw! Oh, come on, that's not fair. Darn right it's not fair. This is the second Christmas in a row you're skipping out on. I know. And you're leaving me alone with Mom... and Dad. I mean, I gotta use all the ammunition I got. Josh, I promise I will make it up to you next Christmas. I swear. I really, really mean it this time. - Is she coming? - It's just that I'm-- I'm almost done with the first draft. - No. You know how I get when I'm writing. I get hyper-focused and-- ...and it's not fair to you guys. Oh. Sorry Sammy. I was just, uh, a little distracted. What can I say? I miss you, Sis. I miss you, too. And uh... but this really is what's best for me right now. I hope you understand that. Yeah, I hear ya. It's just... Look, I understand your work's important, but sometimes you gotta... I can start sorting out the cabin while I'm up here. Sammy, there's no rush on that. We can easily do that next summer. I have to go back out to finish construction on the porch. I know, but... it'll get done faster and I'm already here. Listen, Christmas is a time for family. You need to be around the ones you love and the ones that love you. I hear you, and I understand. Did you get your package from Nana? Yes, I did. It's in my bag. I can't wait to open it. We couldn't wait. It's epic. Ours was a phosphorescent Thomas Kincaid wall hanging. We've already put it up. Okay. Well, look, I'm, uh, I'm up by the cell tree and I am freezing my butt off. Ummm, so I'm going to get going, but, uh, call you on Christmas Eve, okay? Okay. I love you, Sis. I love you, too. Give my love and hugs to everyone, okay? Will do. All right. Bye-bye. Merry Christmas. Well, hello there, kiddo. What you doin' there? It needs a little kick. Okay. You go tell Mom we're going to brunch. Yay, brunch! Seth, that probate officer Mr. Pricker called again. And if I have to hear that... Octavia, what are you talking about here? Probate? I thought that was all settled. You thought wrong. Now, have you found anyone for the Mathis Christmas party yet? I RSVP'd you for two, so you need to get yourself a girl, Seth. It's a Mele Kalikimaka thing. Don't forget to break out your grass skirt. Yoo-hoo! Seth, do you think it's wise to go tromping off into the middle of nowhere? Yes. In the middle of winter? Yes! At Christmas? Bah, humbug. What about the Mathis contract? This should only take a few days. I'll be back with plenty enough time to finalize the Mathis contract. When? At the Christmas party before they leave on holiday. And then, I can focus on closing that Somas deal. You're always running after tomorrow, Seth. You know there's more to life than business. You can't chase progress, Octavia. You have to beat progress. But is all this work really worth it... at this time of the year? You have your way of celebrating and I have mine. Look, I'll be back in two days. Today's a gift, Seth. That's why they call it the present. It would do you good to remember that. Merry Christmas. Lord have mercy, that boy needs a woman! CHEFS COUNTRY CAFE Yes, yes, hello. I'm trying to reach a Mrs. Craigland. It's regarding the property off of Old Forks Road. And I do apologize for the late... Can I get you anything else, hon? No, I'm-- I'm good. Thank you. I believe that there were some documents left out of the package I received from the country surveyor's office. Well, for one thing, there was no address listed. How am I supposed to even find this place? Oh, okay, but lot numbers don't show up on Google Map searches. But I-- please, just... Hello? Hello? Oh, of course. Looks like you got your hands full. Markets never sleep. Well, city boy, what brings you to these parts? Business, actually. Apparently, I had a Great-Uncle Larry who left me property around here. Well, that doesn't sound like business to me. I'm gonna sell it. I just came out here for the weekend to survey the property, and the logging rights alone are probably worth a fortune. Problem is, I don't know how to find this place. I have survey lines and a reference to Old Forks Road, but Old Forks Road doesn't show up on any map. Old Forks Road is a gaming trail. Do you know how to get there? Of course, I do. I got my first buck out by Walker Ridge. Walker Ridge. Walker. Yeah, yeah. Larry Walker was my Great-Uncle. You must be talkin' about Ol' Gusty. Gusty? He was always blowin' in and outta town, you know. People never knew whether he was comin' or goin'. That's how he got the name Gusty. You don't say. He always was off lookin' for his fortune. Nobody's seen him since he broke off with that Parker gal. Did you say Parker? Yes. Mary Beth Parker. He even, uh, built her a cabin up at Parker Pass. After the engagement was broken off... well, Gusty left town. Mary Beth, she married a Whetly. Mary Beth Parker. She's the other shareholder on the property. Oh. I wanna buy her out. With what-- towards, you know, probate and all that. I see. Right. Can you tell me how to get there? Of course, I can. Got somethin' to write on? I don't have anything. What d'ya got? Miss? Miss? - Yeah, hon. - Got a pen? Oh, sure. Got one right here. - Thank you. - What are you boys up to? A fortune. Good luck with that! Yeah. We're gonna split the fortune, right? - Slow down. MR. - This is like a secret map. We're gonna split the fortune or are we not? - Sure. - Okay, all right. - Of course, we will. - All right, all right. Okay. MERRY CHRISTMAS Lamb. Merry Christmas. Oh, hello, handsome. Lookin' trim these days. Why is there so much snow here? And where are all the signs? All right! Is anybody there? Hello. Please. Hello? Uh. I-- I saw you just moving the curtain. Please, I'm begging you. I'm freezing out here. Who is it? Oh my God! I-- I'm Seth. Yeah. Seth Walker. You have no idea how happy I am to hear your voice right now. I'm sorry. I don't know any Seth Walkers. Okay. Yeah. Uh, I mean, of course you don't. Umm... Can I come in? Come in? Um... now? Now's not really a good time. That's, um, that's funny. But seriously, can I come in? I'm freezing to death out here. Are you sure there isn't anywhere else you could be? Are you kidding me, lady? Have you seen where we are? I-- I am so desperate here. Look, I almost died like five times today. Look, I'm lost and alone and I just... I just need you to... I need you to please... Thank you. Hello? 'Morning. Ah, good morning. Getting in a little, uh, mountain workout? There was a ring around the moon last night. It's gonna snow. I think I saw that. You all right? Oh, I'm good. Look like you're hurtin'. Nah, I'm good. Sure about that? Nah, it's just a little tweak. Okay. Let's get you inside. Come on. Okay. Okay, come on now. Are you bleeding? Maybe just internally. Okay then, you'll be fine. Here, lie down on the floor. Easy. Easy does it. Put your feet up here, on the table. Ouch, ouch, ouch! What is this gonna do? Trust me, it works. Your bedside manner is a little rusty. Well, this couch here has a long list of victims. I think it's gettin' worse. Give it a minute and you might just live. You're out here in the wilderness, Seth Walker from San Francisco. Survival of the fittest. Yeah, it seems like I'm learnin' that by the minute. Wait, how did you...? I rifled through your wallet. What? Actually, it was a very sensible thing for me to do. What if you were crazy? What if you were a criminal? Do I look like a criminal to you? I don't know. Do I look crazy to you? Of course not. Have you ever read the book Misery? Relax. I'm just messing with you. How's the back feeling? Surprisingly better. Hmmpf. Samantha Whetly, but everyone calls me Sammy. Seth Walker. Pleased to meet you and thank you for... ...well, everything. All right. Let's get you up. Careful. Okay. Oh, yeah. Careful. It's hot. So, what brings you all the way up here anyway, Seth Walker? Funny you should ask. Business, actually. Business? You mentioned that your name is Whetly. Yes. By any chance, are you related to a Mary Beth Parker? Yes, she's my great-grandmother. She built this cabin. Oh, actually, that's her in that picture there. How do you know about Mary Beth? Well, actually, my Great-Uncle Larry built this cabin in 1928. But apparently your great-grandmother and my great-uncle had a thing. Never trust a Walker. Huh? They'll always walk away. Look, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to leave. I-- I would love to, and... I could do that as soon as we can settle on a price. Price? For what? It turns out that my Uncle Larry's estate was left... well, let's just say kind of messy. But what does your mess have to do with my cabin? You are a living relative of Mary Beth Parker. You have no idea how happy that makes me. Why? I wanna buy out your family's share in the cabin. You're mistaken. This is my great-grandmother's cabin. My family owns it. That's not exactly accurate. Well, see for yourself. That is a copy of my great-uncle's will. In it you'll find a reference to a Mary Beth Parker. You see, my uncle actually owns this land. A thousand acres to be exact, and he is the co-owner of this cabin. Noted in paragraph 4 on page 2, he lists Mary Beth Parker as the co-owner. They had a life share in the cabin. It's all in the property title. There's a copy behind the will. A life share? Yeah, that's just a contractual agreement between co-owners that prevents them from selling to a-- a third party while they're still alive. There must be some kind of mistake. No, no. There's no mistake. It's all right there in black and white. I came up here to survey the property so I could offer a fair price. What? Samantha Whetly, this is your lucky day. I was mistaken. You are crazy. I can make you a good offer. Huh! You are being unreasonable. - Ugh! - I'm being unreasonable? I'd say so. Who do you think you are? You can't just waltz in here out in the middle of nowhere, flash that adorable grin and expect me to sell my cabin! Okay, when you put it that way, it looks bad. But, you can't stop progress. There is no way in hell I would ever sell this place! Oh, come on, I'm sure we can work something out. Okay. Fine. If you won't sign off, I guess I'll see you in court. It's a date! Why are the cute ones always crazy? Miss Whetly, uh, Sammy, can you let me in? Sammy, please. I'm gonna die out here. Is that a promise? You know, according to the will, I own half this cabin, too. Fifty-fifty. Now, open my door and let me in. Ugh! You're welcome. Don't ever say that again! Oh, thank you. Look, I know this isn't ideal, but I can't go anywhere until that storm ends. So? Looks like you're just going to have to make the best of it. You can take that side. What if I have to use the bathroom? Fine. There! Fifty-fifty. Mary Beth made this, too. That smells amazing. Warm, buttery, salty, crunchy. Do you think I could...? Sure. Mmmm, warm, buttery. Salty, crunchy. Fifty-fifty. HELP. Trapped in hell. Sorry. Don't be. Um, I kind of need that. Fifty-fifty. All right. Um... NO SERVICE. Hell has finally frozen over. In 1940. This makes no sense. Okay. That's a bad idea. You're right. That was a horrible idea. Hey Sammy, look at this. I think it stopped. Just the calm before the storm. Yikes! Oh God! Oh! Fifty-fifty. Truce? Oh, come on. Don't be like that. We've been stuck here for two days. We might as well make the best of it. You're giving me the cold shoulder? Really? You gave me the cold shower. You have to admit... That I was wrong? Yes, yes, I was, but... That it was good payback. What is that? It looks a little old-timey. Yahtzee. Everyone knows Yahtzee. Yahtzee. It's fun, you'll like it. Do I have a choice? Nope. Come on, let's go. Hmmpf. Here is your scorecard. Oh, make sure to write your name at the top. But it's just the two of us. I don't think we're gonna mix 'em up. You see this box? Yeah, so? This box is filled with scorecards going generations back. It's like a mini time capsule of family and fun. Come on, you have no reference point for good times gone by? Uh... well, I... That is... so sad. No, it's not sad. I just... I didn't think you would want me to be a part of... Good times gone by? Yeah, well, you know, it's Christmas. And you are now, for better or worse, part of the cabin's history. So, here are the rules of the game. Yahtzee! No! Well, they're fair and square. Your beginner's luck is killing my game! I will take it. So, in regards to this time capsule... Who all has been here? You know, mostly family. Many long gone now, I guess. But what's the story behind your great-grandmother Mary anyway? If I remember correctly, Great-Grandma Mary was jilted when she was left by her fiancé who I now know to be your great-uncle, Larry. Mary and Larry. Sounds kind of corny. It's kind of adorable if you think about it. Anyway, story has it Larry speculated in the stock market. Really? How random is that? Random as what? Why's that? Oh, nothing. Please, continue. Well, Larry, I guess, staked his fortune in something called utility stocks. Pffft! What? What? All right. It's not important. Okay. So, the stock market crashed in 1929. Black Thursday. What? Black Thursday. October 24, 1929. That's the day the stock market crashed. Yeah, okay. That day. Your great-uncle left shortly thereafter to go remake his fortune, leaving my great-grandmother with a broken heart. Ouch! And that's when the family motto began, "Never trust a Walker. They'll always walk away, leaving you in ruin." Wow! That is some pretty shady drama. On behalf of all Walkers, I would like to apologize. No, no need for that, really. I am sure the Whetlys have plenty of skeletons in quite a few closets. So, what are you doing here out in the middle of nowhere in the middle of winter, Sammy Whetly? I am working on a project, if you can believe it. Is that what you've been doing in your room all day? Yes, why do you ask like that? Oh, it's just... Well, I catch you smiling a lot. So? So... why so smiley? What are you working on? I'm working on a book. You're a writer! Mah, something like that. And what do you write? Lately, mostly just drafts. Drafts. Sounds lucrative. Nah. Now you sound like my brother. I'm sorry. Don't be. I get it which is why I tend to avoid the conversation lately. Come on! Oooh, 3's or 4's? Hmmm, I would go for 4's. I think I will. My, that's what, like, eight points? Cocky. See, you are having fun. Yeah, I guess. You guess? No, I am, and it beats a cold shower. So you come out here to be alone to avoid conversations? I didn't say that. Well, it's not entirely inaccurate. I knew it. How are you so sure? It's my job to read people... speculate their comfort levels. I'm a financial trader. Like the stock market? Like Uncle Larry? Random! I know, right? I have to admit, my mind's a little ready to blow, right now. I had no idea, and when you were telling me the story, the hair on the back of my neck started standing up. It was freaky. I have no words. I just keep hearing my family motto running through my mind. I think I might have to toss you out again right now. I did not read you as a heartless person. Oh, how did you read me? I would say you're confident, a risk taker, but you probably have a doable plan B in case things go south. Really? And you're working out something personal. Why do you say that? Why else would someone be all alone on Christmas in a cabin in the middle of nowhere? Well, when you put it like that. So, why aren't you home with your family and friends? Or are we expecting company? Aah, no. It's just me. I just needed some space. I love Christmas. Kids love Christmas. You love the escape. Escape from what? Family. Friends. I could say the same about you. Me? No, I-- I hate Christmas. How can anyone hate Christmas? It's surprisingly very easy. Well, why? What reindeer pooped in your stocking? No, it's nothing like that. It's just... ten years ago, I realized I could use my time better at the end of the year, and it kind of stuck. Ten years? Yep, and all the hard work paid off because business is booming. You're telling me you haven't celebrated Christmas in ten years? Yeah. No presents? - Nope. - No tree? - No. - No office Christmas party? Only if I'm entertaining a client, but even then, I try to avoid it. Oh, I have no words! Don't be judgy. I'm not, it's just... the saddest thing I've ever heard. H-h-hey! I feel like you need an intervention. There's more to life than just business, Seth. You know, I happen to hear that a lot lately. Well, work is important, but you have to carve out time for a little holiday fun. Yeah, maybe I should. I don't believe it. Yahtzee! That is not fair! Ah! What's this for? Seems to be your good luck charm. And a memento. Thank you. Of good times gone by. Well, I think this game is over unless you wanna challenge me to the best two out of three. And have you kick my butt again? Not tonight. So-o-o-o, I guess we have to go to our own side of the room now. Right. I may have been a little extreme with the... The battle lines? No, I get it. All the same, it's not exactly demonstrating goodwill toward man. Merry Christmas. So wait, does this mean that I... This means you can walk into the kitchen. Understood. Whoa, it's really late. Time flies when you're... Having fun? I guess I'll see you in the morning. Okay then. Good night. Good night. Oh, are you warm enough? Actually, I could use another blanket if you have one. Hmmpf. Sorry. Thank you. Uh, um, Sammy... I-- I don't mean to impose upon your goodwill, but do you mind if I could get that uh... Thank you! Seth, I'm sorry. No, don't be. You're right. It was pretty good payback. Oh, uh, thanks again. My pleasure, and you're gonna want to let the water run. It takes a minute to heat up. 'Morning. We're gonna get outta here for a little bit. Can we? Yep. The storm's past. We should have clear skies for a while. Oh, that's... that's great news. You really were going stir-crazy, weren't you? What? No, no. I gotta get back. Get back? I-- I thought you had to survey the property. I did. I-- I do. But I've lost three days. So, we still have time to make the rounds. Might as well see what you've inherited. Some other time. It's the end of the year, and... I gotta get back. I've gotta finalize a contract with a client before he leaves for a holiday. It's two days until Christmas. Who's really doing work? I am. Look, Sammy, I really appreciate all you've done for me. I-- I do. I mean, you saved my life like, twice. And I can see that it's gonna take longer than I anticipated. That's presumptuous. No, no. What I mean to say is... You'll cut your losses and come back later with a better offer? Well, maybe. I don't... I don't know. The offer might be off the table for now. Oh, that was easy. No, no, no. The point is, there's no rush. We can work this out later. Right. My trip was an imposition on you and your charming little holiday, and for that, I'm sorry. What is so important that you have to go back now? Hmmpf, why does that matter? Three days ago, you were trying to kick me out. You're right. I just... I thought that you were finally... Well, never mind. Bye, Seth. Safe journey back. And Seth... Don't forget there's more to life than just business. Be sure to close the door behind you on the way out. Yeah, why not. Thank you. Have I even been doing this right? How did you ever get through Old Forks Road? Dumb luck I suppose. You know, I could take a day. Hmmm. A little room for good times gone by, I guess. What about the contract? What changed your mind? I was thinking about you. I, uh, meant what you said last night. I guess I could use an intervention. Hmmm, yeah. Let's work on that. But just a little one so that I get back before a client leaves on holiday. Deal. Whoa! ♪ It's beginning to look A lot like Christmas ♪ Baby steps. Please. Oh, come on. Ugh! - Ooops! - Whoa! I don't think I'm ever gonna get used to these things. Easy there. Line in with me. Try these. Where were you three days ago? Survival of the fittest. Stick with me and you might just survive. Ah! Oh, you should really use the poles. All right! Where are we going? Besides down? Step one of your... Step one, of your intervention, walking if we can, in a Winter Wonderland. Well, here it is. Here what is? Ridge line. According to that will, everything here is yours. I guess. Wow, I had no idea it was so... Big? Yeah, a thousand acres goes pretty far. Oh, it's impressive. I feel kind of awkward seeing as how I don't even know how my uncle acquired it. Especially after hearing your family's story. You mean to tell me that you acquired a substantial amount of God's country and you have no idea how? My family isn't... well, the closest. That's an understatement. And you know all of your extended relatives? Yeah. I do. Every other summer, we come up to the cabin. This past Fourth of July was one for the scrapbooks. Wait, you were just here for the summer, and you chose to come back out for the winter? Yeah. The quiet, the memories. You're doing it again. What? Smiling. I can't help it. This is a moment worth smiling about. Oh! Step two. Get the wall! You're goin' down. You can't do that. So what's in this manifesto you're working on? It's more of a biography. Oh? About who? I am profiling the life of an amazing woman. Yeah? Yeah, she was a real trailblazer for women's sports. Oh! Really? Uh-hm. She won a bronze medal in the 1948 Olympic Games, but had a heart of gold. Wow! You know, and she just... she used her platform to help train young women to be successful in whatever they chose to do. That's impressive. It is. And she... she spent her whole life championing women's causes. Whew, sounds like a big responsibility. It is. I'd be afraid that I'd miss the mark on a project like that. Well, fortunately, I was trained by the best. Cheers to that. Cheers. Step six, and my personal favorite. Trim up the tree. Oh! Wow, that looks really... old. It is. It's a Great-Grandma Mary ornament. She made it. Really? Yep. And she lived through the Great Depression. You had to be very resourceful in those days. Now I know where you get it from. And her talents were not limited to just sewing. You see that wreath over there? You mean, this raggedy old gaudy gold thing? Don't be judgy! I'm not. It's-- it's very shiny. It's made of ham cans. What? What? Would you look at that? How did she even do this? With pinking shears and a lot of patience. I mean, where would she even find the time to do this? It looks like it took hours. Probably one of those long winter days when going outside wasn't really an option. Hmmpf. I could think of a few other things to occupy my time like day trading or... - Ouch! - Oh! Careful! The wreath bites. Come on. Come help me put together Great-Grandma Mary's tree. What do you mean "put it together"? Ta-da! This is the first time I'm doing it, how am I supposed to help? A notch for every... piece. And you have to push it in like kind of far. Really. Wow. Wh-o-o-o-a. Give it to me. You win. It's your tree. Oooh, it looks so good! It's a lot nicer than mine. Show me how you can juggle. - I just uh... - Don't break any! Look at this one! - Cute. - It's amazing. I love it. Perfect! Oh, ice skates. Don't waste that on the tree. You keep that. Pinecones. My mom used to make these reindeer out of them. She would put like a pipe cleaner around here and make like, the antlers, and then, put two little eyes on the either side. So cute! We had tons of 'em. And this... Ah yeah. Oh, you figured that out. Ha-ha-ha. - Ah! - We've gotta be close to the end. - This one's actually... - Here. - Is it going to light? - Pressure. The pressure's on 'cause it's going to be hard to get that one. Oh, I see. It won't stay. Ah, good work. Oooh! All right! One. At this rate, by next Christmas... We'll have one string. I didn't break that last one because I'm a genius. Look. That's pathetic. That's progress. Ah. - All right. That's... - Back to one. One hour down the drain. Right. What about that gold one? That is a miniature gymnast that was given to me in eighth grade. Were you a gymnast? No! The Summer Olympics was a few months earlier. Nana thought I would aspire to be an Olympian. Did it work? Also a no. I was terribly klutzy as a kid which is why I stuck with the books. Oh, so that is why you are a... Writer. Yeah, I guess you could say that. Well, that and... Nana. Oh, yeah? Nana was the Olympian. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you... It's okay. She passed away last summer. That's why I came up to the cabin. She practically raised my brother Josh and me in the summers. She loved this place. I guess I felt that somehow by being here, she wouldn't feel so far away. Well, that's an adorable gesture. Tell that to Josh. I bailed on Christmas again this year. I'm sure he understands. No. I mean, Christmas is about being with the ones you love. I just didn't have the heart to tell him I was still processing it all. I told him I was... working. And here I thought no one works before Christmas. Yeah, I guess that wasn't very fair of me. So, do you need to go back to work? No, I'm happy where I'm at right now. Today's a gift, and that's why it's called the present. And where did that come from? I heard that from a very feisty and wise lady. And I now understand what she meant. Why Seth, I do believe you're well on your way to a full recovery. Oh really? Yes! I think you just jumped ahead to the 12th step. Have yourself a merry little Christmas. I will. Thank you. Oh my gosh, I almost forgot! Oooh! I didn't realize we were doing gifts. No, it's from my Nana. We just met three days ago. Is there something I should know about? No. It's for me. Nana used to buy them months in advance. Oh, that's thoughtful. Yeah. We found them when we were cleaning out her house. And that's a little creepy. No, it's gonna be lovely. Nana had a very particular taste in Christmas decorations. Wow, it's a... Yeah, wow. Oh! The gawdier the better. Awww! Oh! Oh, it lights up! I'll treasure this forever. Where are you gonna put it? Right there. Sammy... thank you. 'Morning, sleepy. What time is it? 10:30. Wow! Lovely. Thank you. Merry Christmas Eve. It is. Merry Christmas Eve to you. I hope you don't mind. I just grabbed what I could find out of the fridge. Not at all. I love bacon bits. Breakfast of champions. I figured we'd fuel up before heading out. Out? Yeah. I thought we'd explore the south side of the property. Is there anything interesting there? Yeah. Actually, there's a waterfall about half a mile down. It's frozen over, but it's still probably a beautiful sight to see. It's a date. Okay then. We'll head out after breakfast. How do you like your eggs? Oh, um, over easy, please. Comin' right up. Um, I'm gonna freshen up. You better hurry up. Breakfast will be ready soon. Ready to go? - Lead the way. - All right. Hey, this place looks familiar. It should. About a quarter mile down is uh, the entrance to Old Forks Road. This is the cell tree. It's the last place you can get reception before you hit the cabin. Can't miss it. What the-- See? Works every time. Oh, my gosh! Oh-oh! Looks like they found you. Oh, this is not good. What? You okay? Um, yeah. Listen, Sammy... I might have to go. Go? Go where? Home. The Mathis deal I was working on before I came here... fell apart. Hello? Hello. Octavia, can you hear me? Of course, I'm alive. Yes, yes, I know. I just got distracted. What? No, it's not important. No, I am. Right away. Octavia, listen, you're breaking up. Let me call you back in about an hour, okay? Yes, yes. Just call them and tell them to hold on. I am on my way. So, whatever it is, I'm sure it's not that bad. I'm sorry, Sammy, but I have to leave like now. Seth... Seth, wait. Hold on! Would you slow down? I can't. I've really gotta get back. So you're really just gonna leave? - Yes! - Just like that? Yes, like that. I'm sorry if that makes me a jerk, but... Don't be like that. I didn't say that. Be like what? Just make sure that whatever you're looking for is worth it. Sammy, I gotta go back and fix this. Okay. I understand. But how are you even gonna get a flight? It's Christmas Eve. I dunno. I should have thought about that a few days ago before I got stuck out here. Well, I didn't exactly tie you up, and if I remember correctly, I saved your life. Like twice. And where are you going? The cabin's this way. And this is what it looks like when a Whetly walks away. Sammy! Sammy, wait! Sammy... I don't mean it that way. Close the door, please. You're letting out all the hot air. You're still here. I'll be out of your hair in just a minute. What did you do? - No! - I am so sorry. God, Seth... please just back up. I got this. I'm sorry, Sam. I really am. Seth, please. I really screwed this up, haven't I? It's fine. I shouldn't be so careless with my things. You really should get going if you're going to make it back. Seth, I really do hope you have a safe journey. Oh, thank you very much. Hello there, Sis. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Josh. How's the weather holdin' up? It's lookin' a little hairy on the news. Nothin' I can't handle. Did you open Nana's gift yet? Yeah, yeah, I did. Well, don't keep me hanging. What was it? It was this, um,, this-- this statue of the Nativity with this battery-powered candle perpetually lighting up the manger. It's so perfect! She always knew you loved Nativities. Yeah. Oh? I'm sorry, Sammy. Don't cry. You know, she's looking down right now, having a good laugh of her own. Yeah, yeah, I bet she is. I'm sorry. I wish I could give you a hug. I could really use one right now. Hey, how's the book coming along? Yeah. Good. Yeah, it's great. Good, that means your trip was worth it. I shouldn't have bailed, Josh. I'm so sorry. Don't be. I'm just sad you're alone for the holiday. Ugh! You needed this trip. Yeah, I did. Hey look, it's... it's really cold out here. So I'm going to let you go, okay? Okay. Miss you, Sis, and I'm sending you a big hug. Thanks, Bud. Give my love and hugs to everyone, okay? Merry Christmas, Sammy. Love you. Merry Christmas, Josh. Love you. Yes, just book it. But you'll have three layovers and you'll be traveling all day. Look, I don't care. The point is I will get there eventually. But it's Christmas, Seth. So? I've got presents to unwrap. Octavia, I have to fix this deal. Listen, Seth, Christmas may mean nothing to you, but here in the real world, we appreciate this time of the year. Octavia, just get this flight through and I will... I will give you the first two weeks off in January, I swear. There's more to life than business, Seth. Why does everyone keep saying that? Because it's true. Today is a gift, that's why they call it the present. Now, I'm a wise woman, Seth. You'll do best to listen to me. But the... But nothing. The Marshalls have already left. But there's still a chance that... They are in St. Croix, Seth, and you flying in and crashing their Christmas isn't a smart plan. Oh! Well, when you put it that way. Just face it, there's nothing you can do to fix this deal until next year. Ugh, Octavia... what am I gonna do? I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do. Seth, you're gonna have yourself a merry little Christmas. Now go do whatever it is you need to do to figure that out. You're right. Octavia, you are so right. Yes, I am. Thank you for expanding your mind. I am such an idiot! Now I didn't say that, but if you feel the need to be honest with yourself, who am I to stop you. Octavia, thank you. You're welcome. And I'll take you up on that two-week offer. Oh, wait a minute. See you mid-January. Merry Christmas. Lord have mercy, that boy needs a woman! Good morning, Mr. Gatly, and Merry Christmas. Well, if it isn't the city boy. I thought you'd be long gone by now. Nope. I was unexpectedly delayed, but it was a good thing. Did you ever get that sign-off on that property you wanted? You know, I got something better. I'm actually heading back there now. Oh no, not now. You-you can't get through. It's all over the news. There's an avalanche. Closed the pass down. Avalanche? Yeah. It's a big one, too. Blizzard brought in a record amount of snow. It gave way and closed the pass. But Sammy is still up there. I'm afraid there's no gettin' in on Old Forks Road. Well, how am I gonna get to her? I mean, she's all alone up there. There's no cell service. She could be in danger. Well, I guess, uh... Parker Pass is still open. You could get in that way. And you know how to get there? Of course, I do. I got my first billy goat up by Parker Ridge. Of course you did. I'll show you. This is us here, okay? Right? Gotta go straight... Hello? Who is it? It's uh, Seth. Seth Walker. Don't know if I know any Seth Walkers. Um... yeah. We met the other day. Are you sure you don't have anywhere else you need to be? I'm sure. I-I just need to... Hi. Hi. I just need to be with you. I really... just need to be with you. Merry Christmas. What? Go ahead, open it. Uh-hm. I sort of... fell down the mountain on my way over. Oh, it's perfect. I didn't see anybody come up the path. Old Forks Road was closed due to an avalanche. An avalanche? Yeah. No! Oh my gosh! How did you get here? I had to use uh, Parker Pass. Parker Pass? Yeah. Cuts right through my land. I ended up on Walker Ridge. Seth, they call it Walker Ridge because you can see the property line. Okay... Old Forks Road is the property line. Everything to the west of it is yours. Everything to the east of it belongs to the Whetlys. So that makes the cabin... Smack dab in the middle. Fifty-fifty. For better or worse. Merry Christmas, Seth. It's a very merry Christmas, indeed. I just wish that I had a gift to give you. You already did. What? You're here. Today's a gift. That's all the present I need.
