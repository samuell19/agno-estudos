REPORTER 1: The federal government announced it will declare bankruptcy in the next 90... REPORTER 2: Flags continue to be flown at half-mast in the U.S. Capital... REPORTER 3: ... have significantly deteriorated... REPORTER 4: ... developing global recession. REPORTER 4: ... and sustained an ultimately disastrous war. REMY: What do I remember? I remember reading about a scientist. He had a thing for cats and boxes. What he'd do is take a cat and lock it in a box. And then, just to make things interesting, he'd also put this machine in there that released poison gas. Now, the scientist didn't actually know when the machine would release the poison and when it wouldn't. The only way he could tell for sure was to look inside the box. Here's the science bit. Until he opened it up, he figured the cat had to be alive and dead. See, if either one was possible, then both had to be possible, too. Ever since I read about that cat, I can't get the story out of my head. Don't get me wrong, I don't give a fuck about the plight of small, furry animals. I just don't understand. How can anything be alive and dead at the same time? (WOMAN MOANS) WOMAN: Are you ready for tonight's entertainment? (BREATHING DEEPLY) (WHISPERING) Yeah, go, go, go, go. Mr Smythe? I'm from The Union. Holy fuck! Wait! Okay? Just wait. No worries. Keep it holstered. Everything's okay. I can pay. Sorry, that's not my department. (GASPS) Hey. - Hey! - (GROANS) - Don't you fucking touch me. - No need for violence, miss. (ZAPPING) Henry Smythe, I am legally bound to ask you if you would like an ambulance on standby in order to take you to hospital. Nope? Okay. (MAMBO MUSIC PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES) REMY: My job is simple. Can't pay for your car, the bank takes it back. Can't pay for your house, the bank takes it back. Can't pay for your liver, well, that's where I come in. Good morning, everybody. I'm Eric Fitzsimmons. And I'm Sabrina Kenn. From around the globe and around the corner, here's what's happening in your world this morning. FITZSIMMONS: Some big news coming in from Nigeria this morning. KENN: That's in Africa. FITZSIMMONS: Now, of course, you know that we've already got 10,000, 15,000 soldiers over there, waiting at the Nigerian border. - KENN: Come home soon. - Well, not too soon. Word's coming in that the 34th Armoured Division has arrived, and they're ready to start the sixth phase of the war. KENN: Operation Hope Springs Eternal. (NEWS CHATTER CONTINUES INAUDIBLY) Uh-uh-uh! Don't drink out of the bottle. - He does. - Well, you don't. I'm late. Can you take him? - Sure. - Thank you. RADIO HOST: ... first place at yesterday's annual Coney Island hot dog eating contest. Can you say "indigestion"? REMY: Peter, leave it. - You got everything? - PETER: Yeah. Dad, I'm okay from here. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) All right. Have a good day. PETER: Okay. (SIGHS) (WOMAN GASPS) REMY: Almost every job I do ends the exact same way. Some whimper. Some cry. Some even laugh. But in the end, they all do the same horizontal mambo, twitching and thrusting their way into the great beyond. LARRY: Hey, watch the suit! (STAMMERING) Sorry, sir. I didn't know that was you. Sorry about that. MALE ANNOUNCER: The Union, helping you get more you out of you. In years past, nearly 200,000 people waited on organ transplant lists at any given time, hoping for someone else to die so that they could possibly live. But thanks to modern biomedical science, - the days of waiting and praying are over. - FEMALE ANNOUNCER: ... where the artiforg is expertly and cleanly inserted with minimal invasion and scarring. Now, if you can't afford the full payment of $618,429, we can offer monthly instalments at an APR of 19.6%, standard for a generic pancreatic unit. Frank Mercer, Union Manager. I understand you have concerns. Affordability. It's only natural. First of all, let me just reassure you that our credit department will find a plan that fits your lifestyle. And should you fall behind, there is a three-month grace period. Not until after the sixth day of the fourth month of nonpayment will we retrieve the property, at our own expense, of course, utilising our skilled and licensed technicians. Now, I'm not sure what you've heard on the 6:00 news, but this almost never happens. I got to tell you, you owe it to your family. You owe it to yourself. Now, if you could just sign here, here, and initial here, we can get started. REMY: He'll sign it. Everybody signs it. REMY: All right. Ears, ears, ears. Goddamn ears again. Shit. A job's a job, right? I'm just saying, ears, four times in a row. Fucking probation ain't fair. Wasn't fair what you did to that woman on the subway, was it? (WOMAN SCREAMING) Yeah. Well, you weren't there, were you? Hey, my sister's kid, he wants in. He's a good kid. - Talk to Frank. - Yeah, but I figured I'd get a recommendation from you, you know? Level Five? I don't know the kid, do I? You're killing me, coming in the front like that. I got guys trying to make sales out there, I don't need you on the floor spooking clients, all right? We want them buying, not thinking. Six paid-in-fulls this week. You know what that means? REMY: No. What, Frank? They see you, they start turning down the loans and coming up with the cash. We don't make money when they pay in full. Right, pal? - What do you got? - REMY: Liver. - What's that? - Liver. What, are you hanging out at AA meetings? Day's count, give it up, buddy. What's the magic number? - Not today, Jake. - (IMITATES BUZZER) Wrong answer. (GROANING) REMY: Jake Freivald kicked my ass in the fourth grade. It wasn't exactly fair, seeing as he was in the fourth grade for the third time. Maybe he didn't appreciate the rhyme scheme. But he had to admire an aspiring writer who could give as good as he got. After the war, a job at The Union was a perfect match for our specialised skill-set. The recruiter told us we were protecting America's medical establishment. We didn't care who we were protecting. (LAUGHING) - REMY: (GROANING) Fuck! - Hey, come on. Come on, come on. (LAUGHING) Here you go! REMY: Two livers and a Jarvik! You got to stop nicking these bar codes, Jake! Won't happen again, boss! (REMY GROANING) You okay, man? You okay? (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) I'm working with fucking children. (REMY IMITATING ELECTROCUTION SOUNDS) Come on, let's go hit a few. Yeah, all right. I've got to tell Carol. Of course you do. CAROL: So, did you talk to Frank today? - About moving over to sales? - No, I didn't get a chance. What? You mean when you were standing next to him? Right. Right, I'll talk to him on Monday. You know, you're turning me into a horrible, naggy bitch. You were always a horrible, naggy bitch. Just get him out of here. - See you later. - Yeah. REMY: Come on. That went well. Maybe next time she'll crochet you a set of balls. What do you think? FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Come test-drive the most advanced neural sensory replicator, The Union's M.5 Neural Net. Sweet dreams are made of these. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) MALE ANNOUNCER: Stay super dry. JAKE: You know what this is about, right? It's about control. She's trying to control you. I mean, you got to move from Repo to sales, that's like cutting your pay in half, man. Half. REMY: She thinks sales is more stable. Nine to five, no late nights. I'll be home more often. Buddy, you and me, we're always gonna be Repo. (POLICE CAR SIREN WARBLING) Check out fatty. You know his organs went out a long time ago. Twenty bucks says he's overdue. REMY: Go, I'm in. 20 bucks. - REMY: Deadbeat? - Almost. Pancreas. Two days. Oi! How's your pancreas holding up? (STAMMERING) I sent the money in this morning. You better hope you did. 48 hours, your organ's mine. (LAUGHING) Slow down, mate. You're gonna need a new heart, as well. P Morton? That's Patrick Morton. - The guy from Company C? - Yeah. Here, let me see it. (LAUGHING) The bastard... Bastard, he still lives with his parents. Did you ever repo anybody you know? - I had to do my granddad. - (REMY SNORTING) What are you laughing about? You try to explain that to your grandmother. Fuck you, you didn't. I would. I would, on Day 96, if they gave me the pink sheet. - I know you would. - A job's a job, right? Yeah, a job's a job. (SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING) Now you say you're sorry JAKE: Hey, you want another beer or something? Oh, man. For being so untrue Stare any longer, you'll be married by the weekend. Well, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I'm gonna go start a fight or something. I cried a river over you Well, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you Hiya. (WOMAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) (ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING ON SPEAKER) Remember this? Jimmy T-Bone? - Hmm? - Peter's sleeping. Well, we'll turn it down and use our quiet voices. Music's too loud. (MUSIC STOPS) (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) Peanut. (SNICKERS) Peanut. Wake up. You awake? Hi. - Hi. - How was school? - We learned about the Romans. - Mmm? - I made the club. - I can see. - One for you, too. - Thanks. - Weren't these from medieval times? - Yeah. Mrs Begs is making me redo the project. - Well, if she says redo it, you better redo it. - I hate the Romans. Aw, that's a shame. The Romans were real badass. You know, they used to make people fight with lions. Mrs Begs says they used to burn down all the villages when they attacked them. She's right. Scorched earth. Starves out the enemy. Pretty effective tactic. - Hey, Dad? - What? Why did the Romans stone people to death? 'Cause they didn't have any guns. Mmm. Go to sleep. Good night. (SKA MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) I don't want to stifle you, but, you know, you might wanna turn them over just a little bit more. Well, if people ate them as quickly as I'm cooking them, - they wouldn't burn, would they? - All right. Hey, hey. Hot dogs! Charbroiled. MAN: Save me one of those, all right? JAKE: Kind of crispy. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Yeah? (SIGHING) No, this is not a good time, I'm not at home. What do you want? Nobody eats the salad. No one ever eats beetroot salad. I told you not to waste your money on it. Okay, I'll call you back. Bye. I need to... I need to borrow your grill master for a minute. - (SOFTLY) Give me your apron. - What? I got a mobile coming here right now. You want some of this? To my house? Fuck, no. - The guy's six months overdue. - No. It's a double commission. I'll give you half. Half. I'm paying you for a full ride. I just want to get to the Fairmont downtown. Don't worry. You'll be done in a minute. Two minutes. Tops. - Two minutes, tops. - Yeah. - Where's the case? - Front closet. - You're a saint. - I know. He's gone to get more meat. (NERVOUSLY) Who's that guy? (GRUNTING RHYTHMICALLY) Who's that guy? - Relax, fellow. He's a friend of mine. - He's a friend of yours? Hey, come on, man. Come on, let me out of here! Open the door! Come on, man! (ZAPPING) (GROANING) Thanks a lot, man. - Where are you going? - Getting a jacket. I'll get you a... Carol! Hey. I could have gotten you a coat, for goodness' sake. What the fuck do you think you're doing? - I'm stepping away, right now. - Get this out of here! No, no. He's gone. He's out of here. Love, come on. It's just a kidney. - He's got another one. He's fine. - REMY: Jake? - He's fine. - Jake. Peter, turn off the phone! Give me that. REMY: Where are you going? Where are you going? Oh, come on, not this. Let's talk about it, huh? Slow down, let's talk about it. Make a decision. - I went as fast as I could, man. - Yeah, I know you did. I'll have to have that talk with Frank. Did you hear about that new M.5 Neural Net? No. You've been reading those fucking pamphlets again? (CHUCKLES) I saw it at a trade show. The damn thing, it takes over the whole limbic system. Brain damage, stroke, you name it, it doesn't matter. They hook you up, and then it's like you're living the rest of your life in a dream. Yeah? How do you get it out? - Hold on a second. - (BEEPING) Wait, wait, wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (BEEPING CONTINUOUSLY) Shit. What? We got a nest. All right, fine. If you want, you can go in first on this one. What's that? A favour? Of course I'm going in first. You went first last time. - No... - It's simple mathematics. You either have the money, or you don't have the money. You have the money, I'll find you a seat on the boat. Listen to me. You gotta listen to me. There's a bank in Buenos Aires, at the corner of Cacao and Santa Fe! There's a woman there... (PEOPLE SCREAMING) - Raid! - (ZAPPING) Call it. Ten. I'm going to beat you by two. (SCOFFING) (MEN GRUNTING) Where you going? Where you going? I just got here. And you! Now you! (BOTH GRUNTING) (ENUNCIATING) Are you having fun yet? Wake up! Wake up! (GROANS) The Force is strong, Luke. (SCREAMING) You all right? - What are you doing? - I thought you needed help. I had him. Didn't you see I had my knife in his side? I knocked him down. He goes on my count. - (LAUGHING) You're joking me, right? - Jake. I've been working on this guy for 10 minutes! Ten minutes I've been working on this guy. You gonna come in here and just hit him on the side of the head with a pipe? Jake. Look, you're not taking a life. You're keeping The Union viable, so we can continue to give... Conquering heroes have returned with their spoils! All right. What do you got? Eighteen hosts. 32 forgs. - Thirty-two and a half! - FRANK: Half? - Midget. - Little people. Please, I have a cousin. We found a boat heading out of port. Look at these. Two of them had scanning jammers. We pinged them, they read free and clear. I opened them anyway. They had three forgs each. - Stupid bastards will try anything. - Mmm. Thirty-two forgs. Pretty impressive, boys. You ever think about doing this on a regular basis? - Spec? - Yeah! You run your own ship. Take down these nests. Don't have to deal with me and the pink sheets any more. You two riding around together, kicking ass, taking names. I can talk to Corporate, see if they'd bump up the commissions a bit. What do you think, man? What do you think, buddy? Forget it. Actually, Frank, I've been meaning to talk to you about something. - (CLEARS THROAT) Something... - Yeah. Forget that. Find somebody else. Just get us our pink sheets. FRANK: Suit yourself. - Okay, look. Can I just ask you something? - Mmm-hmm. What do you think keeps a world like this's shit together? It's not magic. It's not. It's rules. It's people abiding by the terms of the deals that they sign themselves. It's rules. You know what's more important than the rules, though? It's the enforcement of those rules. I mean, we got a responsibility, you and me. I mean, what we do, I mean, maybe it's small, I don't know, but it matters. It matters. (SIGHING) I'd actually work less hours. You're sure about this? A job's a job, right? A job's a job. Just make sure that they give you hazard pay. You'll be sitting next to Frank, in some booth, telling some cancer-riddled prick, "You owe it to your family. You owe it to yourself." There's a good chance you'll choke on your own vomit. - You should go finish that T-Bone job. - Yeah. It'll be your last hurrah. Get Carol a chance to blow off some steam at the same time. You ready to go after the Patrick Morton's? I was there this morning. He said to say hi. You didn't do it? I did it. He said to say hi before that. (SOUL MUSIC PLAYING) REMY: Jake's right. And if this is going to be my last job, then they don't come much better than Jimmy T-Bone. T-BONE: (SINGING ON TAPE) Every day Will be like a holiday REMY: I've been listening to his music since I was in high school. And the way I see it, at least he's gonna get his heart ripped out by someone who appreciates his music. T-BONE: (SINGING ON TAPE) When my baby comes home REMY: It's a nice house. T-BONE: Thanks. Not really mine any more. - You from the IRS? - No. Soul suckers, taking everything back. Mmm. So am I. (SIGHS) Uh... Can I finish this song? Yeah. Of course. I'm a bit of a fan, actually. T-BONE: (SCOFFS) Yeah? Good. You can help me out. (STAMMERING) I don't... I don't know. I wouldn't be much help. It's not that complicated. A song is just a bunch of separate tracks, all working together. Just got to know when to break it down. You know, pull it out, one thing at a time. Well, I can do that. And every day, oh, yeah Will be like a holiday Oh, yes, it will When my baby (MOUTHING) When my baby comes home That's a motherfucking hit right there, man. IRS will be thrilled. (SCOFFS) (MUSIC STOPS) Can you make sure my boy Terrance at Blue Note Records get this? It's done. (T-BONE EXHALES) Now, I'm legally bound to ask if you would like an ambulance on standby, in order to take you to the hospital. And, what, they gonna give me a new heart? Christ, no, not with your credit history. I know, it's a chicken-and-egg thing. There's a complaints department. Nah, man, nah. Let's just... Will I sit or stand? Easier if you lie down. (ELECTRONIC WHINING) What the fuck is that, man? My defib unit. Jarvik stops pumping when you give it a jolt with electricity. Saves me from losing my finger. Hold on, hold on. Is this... Is this going to hurt? You won't feel a thing. REMY: I have been knocked unconscious on four separate occasions. Knockout number one, military training. - DOCTOR: Head back for the concussion test. - What test? Congratulations, son. You've got a very small brain. REMY: Small brains, big skulls. That's why they put us in a tank. (EXCLAIMING) Fire-fucking-power! - Target sighted! - Fire on will! (BOTH WHOOPING) That's you! Oh, shit! It fucking disappeared! Here, right? REMY: And then one night, the war was over. And there we were, all dressed up and nowhere to go. You see, for us, the war never ended. It just changed venue. Beauty! - Come on! - Come and get it! (GRUNTS) REMY: That takes care of number two. And this is knockout number three. FRANK: (SOFTLY) He's waking up. Hey. Looking good. Looking real good. You gave us a big scare, buddy. The client? Look at this guy. Two seconds out of a coma, and he's worried about the pink sheet. You scare me, pal. Don't worry, we'll get him. Carol? She left a while back, buddy. I don't remember. Faulty shock unit. Frank's got the guys back at the shop looking into that right now. Huh? What is it? I mean, you know that I will be here, no matter what. I would change your fucking diapers if you needed me to. But we got some business that we got to discuss right now. Oh, sure. Look... Jake, he does my work until I get back on my feet. You're a very lucky man, you know that? What you're looking at here is the new Jarvik 39 heart module, top of the line. - (GASPING) No. - FRANK: Oh, yes. - REMY: No, no, no. - Ten billion beat warranty. - It's got the no-rust valves... - Get it out. - Get it out, Jake. - JAKE: You got hit pretty hard. All you got is scar tissue in there right now. I feel fine! (CHUCKLING) 'Cause the unit's already doing its work. All you have to do is sign a few papers. They can take out the meat, put in the new forg, sew you up better than new. The warranty alone on this baby... Don't you sell me. I'm not a fucking client! Of course you're not. You're the best Repo in this whole damn town. But you gotta have a ticker to play the game, am I wrong? You got to do what you got to do, buddy. Take care of yourself. You owe it to your family. You owe it to yourself. (MACHINE BEEPING) What? What did I say? You're an asshole, man. - (GRUNTS) - NURSE: Sir? (GROANING) NURSE: Sir, that's hospital property. (MACHINE SHUTTING DOWN) (GRUNTING) (PANTING SHALLOWLY) (RAPID BEEPING) Buddy? Come on. Let's go back inside, all right? Now you're just being childish. NURSE: Well, that should take care of your pain and help the artiforg assimilate into your body. You got it for three more days, and then it's cold turkey. (DOORBELL RINGS) Carol? The lock's broken. My key works fine. Where are you going? That's a bit extreme, isn't it? I told you to make a decision. You made it when you did another job. Can I see Peter? Come on, Carol. I'm sorry. Who's out here ringing my bell? Damn kids. Hey, man! Get your convalescent ass in here. Thanks again for this, yeah? - You're home, man. You're home. - Yeah. Yeah. And your timing's perfect, all right? 15 minutes, the game starts. Remember that Chinese chick from downstairs? - Yeah. - Her. Well, she's coming up to watch the game, and she's bringing a friend. And her friend is hot. I'm giving her to you. But can I just say one thing, though? This place here is the happy, happy room. Listen. You know, man, I'd love to hang out, but I think it's better if I just sleep. - Great. You wanna sleep? - Yeah. - No problem. But one other thing. - What? (LAUGHING) (GROANING) The guys all missed you so much, we thought we'd get you a little welcome-back present. I'd like to introduce Harry the Heart. (ALL CHEERING) (TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING) Hello! (ALL WHOOPING) (INAUDIBLE) What are you doing in my house? Mr Erikson, I'm from The Union. Stop! No! (CHOKING) (GASPING) (HEART BEATING) (EXHALES) (HEARTBEAT ACCELERATING) (HEARTBEAT SLOWING DOWN) (SIGHS) (FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) (IMITATING FANFARE) All hail the conquering hero! MEN: Hey. - Welcome back. - Big stuff. You gonna keep me in suspense, or you gonna tell me the details? - What happened? - It was standard. Standard job. It was easy. You know, the usual. Pleading, a few tears. Oh, man, I had this guy last week, right? As soon as the guy sees me, he starts bawling like a little girl. And this snot bubble, it starts growing out of his nose. And the more he cried, the bigger it got. Bigger and smaller, bigger and smaller. He's like... (WHIMPERING) I'm like, "Whoa! Okay." I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down." REMY: Listening to Jake swapping stories about some schmuck and his overdue liver, all I can think about is how that schmuck has a name and a wife and kids. (BREATHING DEEPLY) - Hey, Peanut. - Hey. - How are you? - Good. How's school? - Okay, I guess. - Only okay? (REMY CHUCKLES) Peter. Go inside. (WHISPERING) You listen to your mum. Go back inside. PETER: Okay. It'd be good to talk. Carol. Carol! If I could come in for just a minute... Something changed. JAKE: Frank just called. He said you never turned in that pink. You told me there was no problem, right? You said that there was... It was an easy job. Right? (SIGHS) Hey, hey, I get it, I get it. No problem. I understand. I mean, everybody needs a break, right? No time at all, you're gonna be back on your game. You're gonna be knocking them dead. REMY: Mr Timmons, you owe it to your family, you owe it to yourself. I made some moussaka. I want you to try this b?chamel sauce. I'm falling behind on payments. I really need to make some cash. Do what you got to do. JAKE: Gotta make some money, right? REMY: Yeah. JAKE: But you get it out of your system. All right? Of course, if you can't pay the bills, some Union man will break into your house in the middle of the night, slice you open from the collarbone to the pelvis with a scalpel and reclaim our property. (GASPS) I'm just saying. Clearly, I'm not cut out for sales. And this new heart's accumulating interest with every beat. MAN ON TV: Hello. Uh, can we have your liver? REMY: Most people don't know when they're gonna die. I have exactly six days, three hours and between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on how punctual my Repo Man is feeling. It's amazing how fast 90 days go by. Fuck! We're supposed to be partners. And you're just fucking up our shit. You know that? You're fucking up everything. Don't you see that? We've always been lucky here. The metal graveyard's a fucking treasure chest. Thirty minutes, you're going to be back on top. You're gonna see, all right? REMY: It's a black hole. That's all it is. (SCANNER BEEPING) There it is, on a platter. Oesophagus. Five months over. Okay, no, you're not ready to do a kid. Fine, fine. JAKE: Hey, hey, where are you going? (THUDDING) Liver and kidneys. You want me to start? All right, Jake. (ZAPPING) (GROANING) You've done this a thousand times! What the fuck is wrong with you? You stay right here until you get this done. Then you find another one. You find another one. You get as many as you can. I want you to get over this hump. You do this. (GROANS) (GRUNTING) REMY: Part of me, most of me, doesn't mind too much if this is how it ends. 'Cause it's over anyway. For those still counting, this is knockout number four. WOMAN: (SINGING DISTANTLY) Well, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you Now you say you're sorry For being so untrue Miss? Well, you can cry... Miss? ... me a river Cry me... Hey, where did you hear that song? Miss? (CONTINUES SINGING INAUDIBLY) Miss? How do you know that song? And dream of days we... (GROGGILY) I know you. REMY: In three days, they can legally come take my heart. I may not be making the best use of my time. (BETH VOMITS) Two days of withdrawal. It's not like I can't see the dirt or the scars or the Q stains on her lips. I should leave. But for some reason, I can't. (BEEPING) I saw an interview with a serial killer once. Said it took him six years to work up to his first kill. The second, a year. The third, just a week. Once that dam broke, it was a flood. Making people die, it had become second nature. Apparently, it also works the other way round. How you feeling? Stop! Stop! Stop it! (CURSING IN SPANISH) I didn't ask for your help! (GROANS) What did you want me to do, leave you on the street? (CHUCKLING SOFTLY) You're as fucked as me. (LAUGHING) (WHISPERING) Maybe not. REMY: It took me a while, but I think I finally understood why the scientist put the cat in the box. He was trying to tell us something. We're all alive. We're all dead. We're all that cat. But we have to make a choice. We either purr and lick ourselves and wait for the poison to put us down or we scream and scratch and claw our way right out of the top of that damn box. (MOUTHS) Yes. You get nine hearts when I wasn't looking? My uncle was a bank robber. I ever tell you that? Made a mess of the west coast, knocking over savings and loans, you know. And he was good at it. Nobody ever knew a damn thing. He thought he was home free. He woke up in the morning, went to work at the auto shop. But every once in a while, he'd skip out for lunch, pull on a ski mask, rob a bank. Then one day, the cops came knocking at his door. Let me guess. He was relieved. (CHUCKLES) No, he was fucking pissed. He went soft. He was off his game. And he knew it. Who do you think Frank's gonna send after me? Ray? Probably Ray. I don't know. Maybe me. (SIGHS) Mmm. A job's a job. You still believe that? REMY: (WHISPERING) Peter? Peter. - (SLEEPILY) Dad? - Yeah. Hey, listen, I'm going away for a while. It means I won't be able to pick you up on Saturdays. But I'll think about you every day that goes by. (SLEEPILY) See you on Saturday. BETH: What happened? - We got to leave. - What? I got caught trying to clear your forgs. Now they'll want to know where the rest of them are. BETH: You're clear. You can leave me here. I'll be fine on my own. It's okay. I did yours first. I didn't get to mine. Are you coming? REMY: The thing is, I have an artificial heart, and she has an artificial everything else. Maybe we're two parts of the same puzzle. Maybe it's not just her I'm trying to save. Why you giving this to me? I figured you'd want the option. Was I wrong? Give it to somebody else. You want it? Didn't your eyes used to be brown? Opticor 202, with kaleidoscope enhancement.

He did not die, would not concede. REMY: So what is it I'm writing? It's not just some crappy memoir or even an attempt at apologising for everything I've done. This is a cautionary tale. I hope that you might learn from my mistakes. 'Cause in the end, a job is not just a job. It's who you are. And if you want to change who you are, well, first, you have to change what you do. GIRLS: (CHANTING) There was a man from Troubadour who got blown up during the war. He did not die, would not concede. How many artiforgs did he need? - Here. - Thanks. GIRLS: Stomach, bladder, pancreas, eyes, intestines. So, what is it? A novel? Epic poem? Thoughts. It's just (EXHALES) Stuff. And it's not finished. What? Somebody's coming. You don't hear it? What are you doing? Put them on. - GIRLS: ... who got blown up during the war. - (FOOTSTEPS) (FEEDBACK SCREECHING) (EXCLAIMING) GIRLS: He did not die, would not concede.

Grab the typewriter! - There's a fire escape. - No, no! Downstairs. What the fuck is this? This is bullshit. I thought you were a Level Five. Quite honest, I'm... I'm a little disappointed. You're disappointed? They sent the ear guy after me, imagine how I feel. That's a good one. You'll be laughing out of the other side of your mouth when I have your heart in my hand. (SCREAMING) Shit. Beth! Get back! - Beth! - (SCREAMING) No! Fuck! Shit. Oh, shit! - It hurts! - Beth, get out of there. REMY: Come on, get out! (BELL RINGING) (GROANS) Welcome back. Whose car is this? The landlord's. I borrowed it. You're leaking quite a bit of fluid there. I can fix it. - Where are we going? - We're gonna pick up some supplies. Where'd you find all that stuff? When you're on the streets long enough, babe... (GRUNTS) (GROANS SHARPLY) There. "What do you do for a living?" "I'm a fucking lung. "Can you believe that shit? "It's ridiculous, right?"

I'll do that to the next one. The one after. The one after that. I guarantee, you'll run out of Repo Men before I run out of ways of killing them. Great, great. This is just great. Do you have any idea what this makes me look like? One of my own guys jumping credit, huh? Yeah. Now take me out of the system. Fine. Give me your heart. - I said take me out of the system. - And I said give me your goddamn heart. For Christ's sake, you sound like one of them, whining and begging. There is no way out of the system! You screwed that up when you pulled your little stunt with the bar codes! Yeah! That's right, Einstein! They pulled all the local scanners! Now every artiforg reclaim has to go back to the main office, get scanned in behind the pink door! So, unless you're thinking about breaking into Corporate, give me your fucking heart! Or, and there is an option here, we could sit down and talk this out. You know, maybe come up with a plan that fits your... We're leaving. Where are we going? Kenya. South America. Anywhere The Union isn't. The airport? No one gets out through the airport. It's impossible. Not with these. I don't get it. How'd he get in here? He was wearing the damn lung costume.

This way, please. Come on. - We still gonna make the plane? - Absolutely. - These tickets refundable? - I have no idea, sir. - REMY: So when's the last boarding, then? - MALE AGENT: I don't know, sir. FEMALE AGENT: Okay, let's take a look at that leg. Doctor told her to take it easy. She doesn't listen to anyone. (BETH GROANS SOFTLY) It's okay. It happens all the time.

(GROANING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) (TYRES SCREECHING) REMY: We got to dump this car, get you a new kneecap. Hold on. (TYRES SCREECHING) (HORNS BLARING) BETH: I know someone who can help. He's outside the Union. - REMY: Is he a vulture? - We don't have any choice. BETH: Believe me, it's the last place I want to go. REMY: This is a bad idea. - He always left me a key up here. - How well did you know this guy? (ELEVATOR WHIRRING) (VOCALIZING) (SINGING) I gave her my loving She gave me blue balls I gave her my money... Put it away. Put it away. (SINGING) I gave her the thing a man... BETH: Asbury. - Little, little Miss Muffet. - Don't call me that. (SPEAKING SPANISH) We need your help. - Why'd you have to drag me a U-man, huh? - I'm not with them any more. Why? Did you quit or was he quitted? (SPEAKING SPANISH) - Got my cookies? - Yeah, I got your cookies. (ASBURY CLEARS THROAT) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Don't touch anything, U-man.

(UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (WHIRRING) REMY: You pay for these? What'd you say? - Did you pay for these? - Pay for yours? - REMY: That's different. - Yeah, how's that different, U-man, huh? I'm Robin Hood, baby. I'm Jesus, I'm Gandhi. I can lift the valve from some fresh meat and then drop it in a new client for half the cost. Bottom line, I don't kill my clients. I wait for them to die. What do you do to your clients when you're finished with them, huh? - Chop them up for dog meat? - You know what? You got your own thoughts, huh? Company parrot? - I'd rather be a fucking parrot... - Parrot! ...than a fucking vulture! Fucking vulture! - Parrot! Parrot! You think you're the solution, man? You're the problem! REMY: I'm the problem? You're the fucking problem! Hey! When the pissing contest is over, may I have some help? (MUSIC STOPS) So what do you want me to do? You want me to put you two on the boat, is that it? Yeah. But I can't run if I can't walk. I'm sorry, baby, I just don't fly with joints any more. We're gonna have to switch over to Alva for that insertion. - That bitch almost killed me. - Well, that's your side of the fairytale, isn't it? But I'll tell you something. It warms my cock that you're still sore about that. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (GROANS) Have a seat. LITTLE ALVA: Another one, Mom? ALVA: Yeah, baby, another one. So let Mama work a minute. That's Little Alva. - Hey. - Hello. ALVA: Before we start, I'm gonna need to know about all your other artiforgs. What do you mean? You put most of them in. Beth, humour me. (SIGHS) Ears, Vocar. Opticor eyes. My liver is a Hexa-Tan from a speciality house in Denmark. My kidneys are actually two different models. One is a Union generic. The other one (YAWNING) didn't hold up so well. (BETH EXHALES) Lord, I thought she was gonna go on forever. Wait. Don't you need her to tell you the rest? Nah, that's just my version of "Count back from 100." All right, baby, you're up. - What are we doing? - ALVA: A new knee. What? She's the surgeon? Yeah, I just do anaesthesia these days. The little one's got the steadier hand. She's five! She's nine, actually, but she's been doing this since she was four. - Ain't that right, pumpkin? - Shh! I almost got it. Yay! (EXHALES) BETH: I feel like break dancing. REMY: Go on, then. Hop along. Wait. (DEVICE BEEPING) Stay here. (CRACKLING) Beth, let's get out of here. (MAN GROANS ON TAPE) ASBURY: All right, all right, all right, I'm coming. U-man number two, huh? - Man, you guys regen like a cancer... - Beth. (MAN GROANS ON TAPE) ASBURY: All right... It just goes on like that for awhile. How'd you find us? Found you the same way you would have found me. I see what's going on here. I get this. I get it. I do. But I can make this right with Frank. All you got to do is you got to come back with me. Beth, wait there. I'll deal with you later. I'll deal with you later. No. I can't go back. That's who you are, man. That's who you are. Not any more. Not since the accident. There you go again with the accident! If I had known that you were going to be such a pussy about the accident... What? What, you thought it was fate? Sort of karmic plan to get you right with the world? Is that what you thought? - Jake... - Let me tell you, the cosmos, it doesn't know shit about swapping out electrical leads. You rigged the defib unit. Didn't you? For what? So I'd build up debt so I wouldn't transfer to sales? You're not a salesman, man! You never would've been. You never could be! All you had to do was just to keep working. You and me, doing our thing. You're fucking crazy, do you know that? You could have killed me. I tried to save your life. I'm not going with you. Well, I'm not letting you go. God. (BOTH GRUNTING) (REMY GRUNTING) (GROANING) (BELLOWING) (BETH YELLS) (GROANING) (LAUGHING) (CONTINUES LAUGHING) Let's go, buddy. No! FRANK: You owe it to yourself. JAKE: You've done this a thousand times! Buddy, you and me, we're always gonna be Repo. REMY: (WHISPERS) Stay with me. BETH: (WHISPERS) Always. FRANK: There is no way out of the system! You screwed that up when you pulled your little stunt with the bar codes! BETH: Hey, wake up. Wake up. Come on, get up. (GROANS) You okay? Uh-uh. (CHUCKLES WEAKLY) We got to go. MAN 1: Raid! Repo! MAN 2: Raid, raid! MAN 3: Go! Go! Go! MAN: Raid! BETH: Fuck! (WOMEN SCREAMING) (TASERS FIRING) WOMAN: Help me! Please, help! REMY: Where'd they go? (MUFFLED SCREAMING) (DISTANT SHOUTING) Singing my favourite song. (EXHALING) Okay. - Wait. - Back off! (ENUNCIATING) Give me one reason why I shouldn't pull this trigger. Welcome to your world, Repo Man. (INDISTINCT DISTANT SHOUTING) (DISTANT GUNFIRE) (EXPLOSION) (GASPING) Come back inside. - We can stay here until we find a way out. - There is no way out. Stop, please. There is no way out. Not for anyone. Wherever we go, wherever we hide, they'll find us. That's what they do. That's what I did. What do you want to do? Finish this. Okay, so we go to headquarters and find the pink door... We go to headquarters, we find the pink door, we wipe the system. No more accounts. Nobody's overdue. That's easy. - Here he is. - Hmm? - Peanut. - Dad! - Thanks for bringing him. - I can't believe you let it get this far. Just let me have a minute with my son. Who's she? Carol, shall we do this on the train? Come on. Frank and Jake are calling me three times a day, trying to find you. I haven't got time for this. All I'm asking for is a few minutes with Peter. Do you think I'm having a good time trying to raise him on my own? - PETER: Mom! Dad. - Peter, I'm talking! (WHISPERING FIERCELY) I didn't have a fucking choice! You think I wanted to just walk away from the situation? Give me a moment with my son. CAROL: Oh, I'm sure that's exactly what you like, for your problems to just walk away and just disappear. - That's not... - (ZAPPING) (WHISPERING) Peter! (REMY CHUCKLES) That was very naughty. (STIFLING LAUGHTER) Very, very naughty what you just did. BETH: Come on, come on, we gotta go. When you're old enough, you read this. And if you still want to see your old man, I'll be in Punta del Este. - Can you say that? - Punta del Este. REMY: I love you. Look after your mum. Hi. Come on. Again? So, what's the plan? Wait here. My feet are always freezing. What? The cotton socks don't work? - I always wear cotton socks. - Hey, who's this guy? Sir, this is a restricted area. It's all about who you know. So what is it, bright pink or pale pink? I don't know. You see a pink door, you go for it. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Let's go. (CHATTERING) (MUZAK PLAYING) Come on. Oi! Come on. Oi! (PANTING) (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) This is it? Oh, shit. - Union men. - What are we going to do? (SOFTLY) Fuck. Grab the axe. Freeze! GUARD 1: Don't move! GUARD 2: Drop it now! Your weapons!

(GRUNTS) (GROANING) There's no keyboard. - There's no keyboard. - So? So, if there's no keyboard, how can I get into the system? How do I wipe the accounts? - Maybe there's a different way. - Using what? - I don't know. An interface or something. - Look at it, Beth, it's a scanner. That's it. Even if we were just... I mean, we... The only... (SIGHS) - The only way out of the system... - Is what? (QUIETLY) The only way out of the system is to repo ourselves. - (ALARM CONTINUES WAILING) - Can't get in without a forg. We're surrounded by the fucking things. Please make your way to the nearest exit. This is not a drill. You're kidding, right? Stop it. No. Stop it. - No! - Beth. - No! - Beth. - We'll die. - Beth. - We can fight our way back out. - We didn't come all this way to run back out. Help me. (SIREN CONTINUES WAILING) (SCANNER CHIRPING) Wait. (GROANING) (GROANING) (GASPING) I can't. Beth. I can't dance the mambo alone. (BEEPING) AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Please deposit one artiforg in reclaim drawer. Have a nice day. (ALARM CONTINUES WAILING) Please make your way to the nearest exit. This is not a drill. Have a nice day. (BEEPS) (GROANING) (BEEPING) (BEEPING) Stay with me. Always. (SQUELCHING) (DOOR BEEPS) REMY: Stay with me. Only one left, all right? Only one left. Don't go now. - What are you doing? - I'm losing her. There's only one left. There's only one left. Oh, Jesus, this is fucking pathetic. Finish it. Stay with me! JAKE: Is it really worth it? Is she really worth it? She's worth every job we ever did. She's worth every job we ever did. FRANK: End it, Jake. Now. All right, then. Enough of this bullshit. I'll do it myself. Beth. Give her a shot. Just give her a shot. (GASPING) We're out. We're out. AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Please deposit 11 artiforgs in reclaim drawer. Have a nice day. We're not out yet, buddy. Not yet. Scorched earth. Just like you told the kid. Romans... They were some badasses. (BEEPING) AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Artiforg not recognised. Lockdown in effect. (BEEPING RAPIDLY) An administrator will be with you shortly. Have a nice day. JIMMY T-BONE: (SINGING ON RADIO) Every day Will be like a holiday BETH: Mmm. Christ, it's hot. It's the tropics. Yeah, I know. It's hot. Are you going to stay here and act macho, or come and have some fun? Christ, it's hot. Huh? Macho. "Repossession Mambo." - Sounds kind of fruity. - (LAUGHING) Peter had it published. "An instant classic. "The depths of this author's insights are astonishing." (JAKE LAUGHING) Am I in this? (STATIC CRACKLING) JAKE: What's happening? TECHNICIAN: It's just a glitch. It'll sort itself out. There. All better. (MONITOR BEEPING RHYTHMICALLY) See? His endorphins are up, limbic system's running strong. Hey, hey, you guys take it easy. I want him to be comfortable. All right? - Yes, sir. - TECHNICIAN: Nothing to worry about. If that hook had hit him any lower, it might have posed a problem. The M.5 Neural Net is top of the line. What's he thinking about? TECHNICIAN: No way to know. Yeah, but he's happy right now. As long as someone's paying for the system. There's 50 commissions right there. That'll take care of his heart, that'll take care of the down payment on the M.5. The Union can dock my pay for the rest. Hey, sir. Sir! This one's still alive. Leave her. I'll take care of her. Hold. Sweet dreams, buddy. For extensive neurological injuries, I'd have to recommend the M.5 Neural Net. We're running a special on it this month, 18% for the first year, 24% after that. Why should your loved one pass on just because of a little brain damage? That's barbaric. That's just bad science. (STIFLES SOB) With the M.5 Neural Net, yesterday's dreams are today's reality. Imagine your loved ones living out the rest of their natural lives in a world where they are always happy, always content, and always taken care of. You owe it to your family. You owe it to yourself. A little fruit for the fruit? Why not? Cheers. (LAUGHING)
