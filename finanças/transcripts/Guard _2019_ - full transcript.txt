Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! - Are you okay in there? - Don't touch me, asshole! Where do you think you're going? Hey, I'm talking to you! - Help! - What's wrong with you? Help! Help! He's a maniac! Somebody help! Help! He's gonna kill me! Help! Open the door! Open it! It's open! It's open! This is insane. Help! Somebody! Anybody! Somebody! Get away from me, you jerk! - What are you doing, you stupid cow? - Asshole! You're not gonna get me! Not gonna get me! Somebody help! He's a maniac! I'm not a maniac! Get a grip! - Help! - I'm the watchman, you dumb-ass! Cut it out! Help! Help! Help! What the hell… Where am I? Please! I'm scared! I'm cold! I want to go home! Please! Which way's home? Somebody help! Is anyone here? God… Good morning! Where am I? On the table. Why? Don't ask me that. Try drinking less. Where am I, mister? In a health retreat, lady. You don't remember much? Can I have some water? Bathroom's that way. - Why so rude? - Look at the state you're in! And all around you! Are you going to pay for that? Did you bash me around? Like you'd let me. Are you going to pay for the damage? Why is it so cold in here? You broke a window. So you're not a nut job? Are you okay in the head? Yes. Did you fall off the wagon? - I want a cup of hot tea. - Pay me for the window. For the smashed plates. Then you'll get tea. I have nothing. In that case, I'm calling the cops. They'll make you tea. Relax, I'll pay you. Did you even see my car? I'll go to the city and get cash from my credit card. But first I need a hot bath. And a glass of bubbly, right? Fine, which way's the reception area? I want to rent a room. No one's in. The place is closed. It's just me here. - Well, then I'm leaving. - Sure! As if. Pay up! Or I'm calling the cops. Listen, you! Are you just asking for trouble? - What now? - There's no need for that. Fine. Are you okay to drive? - Yeah, I'll manage. - You can stay, rest, take a bath… I'm fine. It's a short drive to the city. Hold on. I'll clear the road for you. - Sorry about the... - It's okay! Stas… Got any vodka? Nope. I thought I was a goner. I was fine just walking down the road. But then the blizzard started. I couldn't see anything. If only I had known, I'd have put up with your screeching and nagging… just to stay in the car. How much for the mess? Well, I think I can fix the gate myself. So the window, the plates… Say, ten grand? You're here all by yourself? The resort's closed. What about your boss? Haven't seen him in six months. That's some job, man! Listen. How about we stay here for a week? Put us up at the far end somewhere. And if anyone comes, just don't tell them about us. And we'll be real quiet. For each day, you'll get another one of these. - What about the rest? - There's no need. You can stay here. Breakfast at 8:00 a.m. Dinner at 7:00 p.m. You put one foot wrong, you're out of here. Sure thing! You drunken bitch! You're lucky he didn't call the cops! - I should've kicked you out of the car! - You asked to get out! Because you wouldn't shut up! If I say we need to go, then you shut up and go! Why did you drag me with you? I would have stayed home! - I can't even look at you! - Where are you going? Stop! Come back! Vera! Can I have another room? Will it help? Sorry! Made a bit of a racket. - Are you done yet? - Can I have another room? Take any room key in the reception area. Oh, come on! That's the way the cookie crumbles! Are you married? Good night. Morning! Any chance of breakfast? There's food on the stove in the cafeteria. Have you worked here long? Long enough. What's so funny? No offense. It's just weird. You're a big guy. Smart. What are you doing working in this place? - I'm guarding it. - Yeah, I got that. Did something happen? Can't be too choosy these days. But this place is just hopeless. This job is for hobos. Do you have a disability? I didn't mean it like that. It's not like you can help it. Shit happens. I know. Oh, no, you don't! You stupid woman! Stop! Stop! - Did you fix the gate? - Not yet! Damn it! Just call her. We don't have phones on us. We left them at home on purpose. Stubborn bitch! I'm worried sick, and you just drive off to get booze? What if somebody saw you in the city? I'm having a hard time too! Can't you lay off the stuff for one day? I want to get shitfaced too, you know! I'm talking to you, bitch. I'll kick the door in. No, you won't. Now you want to bust my balls, too? Stay out of this! One more argument and you're both out. Want a drink? Will it make you feel better? No. Then what's the point? Does everything have to have a point with you? - They found us! - Hey, you! Out! Vera! - Are you okay? - Come out! - We have to get out of here. - No, don't! Or we'll burn the shit out of this place! Hey! Where are you, son of a bitch? It's not you they want. Come on! Enough already! Don't be scared! Grow a pair! Hey, where are you? Get down here now before we burn this damn place down! We won't kick you to death! Come on! Get down here! You're hiding, huh? The jerk's hiding! You weren't hiding when you were doing some messed-up shit, but now you're terrified, yeah? Don't be scared! Don't you fear! Vlad! Stop being such a wuss, man, for real! Are you coming or what? Wow! Look who's here! Well, come on! Get down here! I see you're alive and well, you little bitch. Why so quiet? You're sitting pretty here. Nice and quiet. No one bothering you. - Spa resort. - It's a health retreat! Pine trees! Fresh air! Look how healthy he looks! Yeah, it's nothing at all like prison. Do you sleep well at night? Got nothing to say? Why doesn't hell open up and swallow you? Why so quiet, bastard? - Say something, you bitch! - Easy! Why waste energy on him, Son? Let's just take him into the woods. It's a dark night out there. He'll get lost. - The wolves ate him. - Are you serious, Palych? You actually want to whack him? You think he doesn't deserve it? Come on. Don't go there, guys. The deal was to give him a good beating. - Nothing more. - Shut up. Even burning him alive would be going easy on him. Dad! Get me the gas can. Hey, hey, man! Palych, what the hell are you doing? - Stas, help him! - How? - Do you want to go to prison? - Stay out of this! Here. What are you doing, you fools? Can't you see they're going to burn him alive? They're not going to do it. Give me the lighter, Dad! Don't. Please. You're scum. Man, you'd better leave this place. You got off easy today. Next time they get shitfaced, who knows? They'll either burn you or hang you. Just like your dog. Yeah… some peace and quiet you've got here. Let's get some sleep. Dude, we have to know if it's safe for us to stay here. I mean, if this is a daily thing… It's not. Anyway, if you don't like it here, you're free to leave. Why did they do this to you? Doesn't matter. And what does matter? That I don't lose my job over this. Why didn't you put up a fight? There were three of them. So it was easier to burn alive? What's it to you? I don't ask you why you drink yourself stupid daily. - Go ahead and ask. - What good will it do? I won't feel better, and neither will you. So nothing's going to change. You're right. Feeling sorry for each other? It won't make things better. Darling. Maybe give your liver a break? My brain needs a break more. Not if you get the shakes. Then it's bye-bye brain. I don't care. Seriously? What about me? I'll be all alone. You're always alone, so no change there. That's harsh. Want me to feel sorry for you? Feel sorry for yourself. I'm all good. I believe you. Don't touch me, bastard! The guy gave us shelter. You didn't even come out to help him. You worm. And that's my life in a nutshell. Don't listen to her. I was going to help, but I knew they were just messing with you. Don't worry about it. Enough already! Yes? Mind if I join you? What? Feeling rough? Yeah. Come in. - Tea? - Yeah, all right. What's your name? Not going to tell me? You don't tell me about yourself. I had just finished university when Mom left us. Dad started to drink. I had to take care of my two brothers. A schoolkid and a registered offender. He broke into a shop. So I worked two shifts then spent half the night cooking. Or looking for my father all over town so he wouldn't freeze in a ditch. This one time, I went to a club with my friend. Got really drunk because I was down. Just letting loose, throwing myself on every guy I see. There's this one guy in the corner just sitting and watching me. Stas? He turned out to be quite well off. We got married a week later. I wasn't thinking about whether I loved him or not. I just knew that I was safe. Yeah, safe. Didn't have kids for a long time though. Then he became kind of jumpy. Not talking, hardly sleeping. Any question I asked, all I got was "Shut it, teach." I was going to leave him. And then… three months pregnant. I had the baby. Then about two years in… he got sick. Really sick. We saw lots of doctors. No one knew how to make him better. And then it was too late. Couldn't save him. I started to drink heavily. He had a meltdown at work. Flipped out badly. One day, he redirected all the money… from the company accounts… grabbed me… and we just fled. Can I help you? I think I might be lost. - Where were you going? - To a hotel. It's in the city. You should have stayed on the main road. What's this place? A heath retreat. It's closed. Any chance I could stay here for the night? I told you this place is closed. There's a hotel in the city. Got it. Okay, well, thanks. Have a safe trip! Tell Stas I'll be back tonight. Who? Tell him not to panic. I came alone. No one else knows. He's gone. What did he look like? Tall, big. Expensive car. Missing a finger on his right hand. Bagor. He said he came alone and that he'll be back tonight. How did they find us? We made no plan, just drove straight ahead. You thought you could hide? Enough out of you, smartass! Did you pay for your booze with your card? - What if he really came alone? - You want to stay and check? Okay. We can't leave the building. They'll see us. When he comes back, just play dumb. No one's here. No one came. We'll leave when night comes. Is Stas still here? I told you there's no one here. Patience, girls. I'll handle this. What are you standing there for? Open the gate! - Valentin Makarovich, is that you? - No, it's your mother! Open the gate, damn it! They'll let us in, and you'll have your sauna and your swimming pool. Even Santa and his little helpers if you want. Guess where. So, any news? Nope. Still no one here. I'm going to stay here. What? But we were going to the sauna! I'm tired. And drunk. I just want to sleep it off. Suit yourself. Okay then, ladies, shall we? - Are we going to come back here later? - Sure we are! Of course we'll come back! Let's go! Come on! Sauna time! Okay, watchman. Go tell him I'm here alone. I thought I told you… Don't mess with me. They're here. I need to talk to Stas. Stas who? If I wanted to bring him down, the place would be surrounded. Tell him not to freak out. Go! Go now. They don't stand a chance without me. - Get in. - Let go off me! - I said get in! - I'm not going anywhere! Stas! You asshole! I just want to talk! I'm trying to save your ass, dimwit! Damn! You got me! You got me! Don't shoot! Drop your gun! Well, hi there, Bagor. Are you alone? - Be honest now. - Yes, for the time being. How come? Just wanted to talk. About what? - He's bleeding. - I can see that. - Got to get him to the hospital. - Are you a doctor? He'll bleed to death. Are you a doctor? - But he'll die! - Exactly. I'd better hurry. I have a few questions. So get off my back. Listen to him. Shut it, you! Well? Listen, I really do need to get to the hospital. Why did you come? When they found out you made a run for it, they checked the accounts, and you'd cleaned them out. Should I have left the money to you guys while you were planning to ditch me? You're upset. I get it. But it's not just your money. And so you thought I'd share with you? I'm trying to help you escape. You're not really planning on hiding here forever, are you? How did you find me? So far, no one else knows you're here. How did you find me? She called me. Asked me to help. We'll fix this, Stas. You'll sit it out. Bogatov won't be there forever. Everyone's gunning for him. - Call me an ambulance. - Go back inside. - What are you doing? Come on. - You have two gunshot wounds. The medics will call the cops. What will you to tell them? - I won't rat on you. - Don't play stupid. You know the deal. Get the hell out of here! Damn! Come on, Stas. Don't be a monster. Son of a bitch! That bastard! That's what I get for feeling sorry for him! He missed the liver. That's good. - I don't get it. Are you a doctor? - A surgeon. - You need surgery. - No, I don't. And lift! Keep it together! The faster we get inside, the less blood you'll lose. - What about him? - He's dead all right. Bastard! Go to the kitchen! The large pot from the stove! Chlorine, a bucket of water, a knife, and two forks! - A knife and two forks. - Move it! Put pressure on it. Press hard! And try not to pass out. - Where are you going? - Sing something! - Why? - So you don't fall asleep! Through the raspberry shrubs through the arrowwood thicket Onwards to the puppy's birthday party The rubber hedgehog with a raspberry hat And a hole in his side trudged through The hedgehog had but an umbrella a hat and a pair of rain boots Greeting the ladybug and each flower On his way, the hedgehog gracefully bowed Hello, fir trees! Why are you so prickly? Or are we all just wolves to you? Pour chlorine into the bucket and the pot. Water goes in the basin! You should be ashamed of yourselves! It hurts when… The sky's clear… That's it! Stop! The sun… sun's… bright Onwards to the puppy's birthday party The rubber hedgehog marched on and whistled Through the hole In his side Pass me the pot! What the… Plug it in! - I can't remember the lyrics! - What about the tune? Then whistle it! - Headache? - Bad one, yeah. You're gonna cut me with those? Got anything else? Hand off the wound. Take this! Dab the wound when I tell you to. You can stop whistling now. Breathe normally or you'll faint. Wait! You're really a surgeon? Really. Ready? - Yes. - Now. Dab. Eyes on the wound! - I'm nauseous. - I don't care! Now. Dab. You've got to toughen up. Just hold still. - Bullet's coming out. - With those? Ready? No! Now! Not it. No! Not it. Got it. Press it in. Hold it! Take it out! Is he going to live? I don't know. Wait here. Vera! Vera! Get me some water. Thanks. Would you look at that? With forks, huh? Damn! - And yet he lives in the woods. - Stas. How long are we going to keep on running? You don't trust anyone. There's no one to help us, nowhere to run. And he's your friend after all. He was your friend. So why did he come here to fleece us? Maybe because he really didn't tell anyone we're here. Maybe he didn't. What's that supposed to mean? Well, I don't know who else you called. Maybe you want to rat me out so that they spare you. Or maybe that's your revenge. Or maybe you just can't wait to die. I saw you up on that roof. Is that what you think? What the hell do I know? How stupid are you? We were friends, my ass. That's bullshit! They're going all out to get rid of me. Alive, I'm like cancer to them. If they don't finish me, I'll finish them. So if you want to croak, that's fine by me. But count me out! You'll live, Stas. You're tenacious. - You'll outlive us all. - God willing. If I were any different, we'd be living like cattle. What good is this life? What good is all this money now? - Now that he's gone. - Now, really? It didn't seem to bother you before. You were okay with it, weren't you? All set and sitting pretty. I was stupid. I didn't know there was a price to pay. "Don't think about it. As long as we're living the good life!" And now we'll be choking on every penny. You're grieving and losing your marbles, that's all. As soon as we get out of this mess, you'll go see a specialist. We won't get out. So you pulled through? Are you a saint by any chance? Ever raised people from the dead? Hey! Hey! How are you feeling? Like a new man! It's a miracle. We'll be out of your hair in a couple of days. So, what have you been up to? You two thought I was done for? As you said, I'm tenacious. I'm not leaving. Go away. What have you done? Go away. What the hell did you do that for? - Get out or I'll scream. - So? He'll come running? Go ahead! What do I have to lose? I've lost Sashka and now you. To hell with it all! I'm sorry. I just can't take it anymore. You no longer love me? I never did. You know that. We have to stick together, don't you see? We won't make it alone. We can't. You won't cope without me. I will. But I won't. Don't you get it? I won't! That's enough. Enough! From now on, we go our separate ways. Let me go, asshole! Get off! I hate you, you creep! Vera! Vera, don't! Vera! Vera! Vera, don't! Stop! Stay away from me, asshole! - What are you doing, you idiot? - Don't come closer! Come back down, stupid! Stay away! Don't do it! - Stas! - Go to hell! You won't get me. Okay, you win. I'll let you go. Take the car and the money. Go wherever you want. You won't get me. Honey, don't! This is crazy. You won't get me. You won't get me. I love you. Go to hell. You think you're better than me? You think she'll start a new and happy life with you? She'll still end up in a loony bin or drink herself to death. She's a nutcase. That's why I married her. Sure, I didn't tell her about my work stuff. As if she didn't know who she was living with and where the money was coming from. Of course she did, and that means she was okay with it. When Sashka died… that's when she lost it. So you can stop drooling over her, bonehead. What kind of life can you give her? She's just freaking out. She doesn't know what to do with herself. And you do know what to do with her? I'm going to call Bogatov. They'll come for him tonight. What? He'll never let me go. I know it. But they'll kill him. I've got some money. If we're careful, it'll last us a couple of years. We'll run away. You'll work as a doctor. Run away? Why not? You think this will fix everything? I don't. But we can at least try. Don't you want to start over? They brought her in at night. Open femoral fracture, artery ruptured. She was bleeding out. She blamed herself. Jaywalking, she crossed the road at a red light. She was in a hurry to get home. It was her birthday. So she ran. The driver who hit her brought her in. She was awake for about five minutes. She kept asking us not to tell her husband and son. She was afraid they'd get mad at her. She was in shock. They put her on the table… and as luck would have it, I was badly hungover. Hands shaking. Couldn't even pick up the scalpel. I just kept looking at her and thinking… "Why should you live?" "Why should you live?" The assistant is shouting and cursing at me. But I just stand there, frozen. As if I were the one hit by a car. They dragged the other surgeon out of bed, but it was too late. Cardiac arrest. She died. I was young. Best surgeon in the district. I worked for ten years. Lost my edge. So many sick people. Every other patient needed surgery. Six surgeries a day. No money, no sleep. I gave up. Everything was shit. People were shit. And I was… shit. Don't make that phone call. Don't do it. You'll never forgive yourself. Get up! Now! What the hell, man? Get up! They're coming for you. It's true. Don't you dare! Like I'd bother! Bitch! Who are you? The watchman. We're looking for two people, a married couple. We received a call saying they're here. Is that the case? - They were here. - And now? Please understand. It would be better for you if you told me the truth. They must have offered you money for your silence. But no money is worth what will happen to you if you lie to me right now. They left. - What about the car there? - It broke down. You can check. - So, how did they leave then? - Taxi. What make? What license plate? A dark sedan. I don't remember. We could run the plates, but it's no good once they switch cars. I'm telling you the truth. They stayed here. I let them because they paid me. They were at each other's throats. Then one of your men came here. The guy killed him. The woman freaked out and called you. He beat her up, called for a taxi about an hour ago, grabbed her, and left. Why didn't he kill you? You're a witness. I hid the car and the body. Stas is an animal. - He'd have whacked him as soon as... - Andrey! So? Looks like it's empty. - Have you checked every room? - There are 300 rooms in this thing! Where are they? Take off your belt, Vanya. Why me? Let him do it. I can't. My pants will fall off. I lost five kilos, man. Take it off. I won't beat him up with my own fists, will I? Grab him. Come on! Don't even think about it. More? Where are they? They left. More. Get off my back. What do you want from me? Do I kill him or what? Listen to me, watchman. I know they're here. You're hiding them here somewhere safe. They left. Finish him off. Hello, Stas! Hello, Tolya! We nearly killed him. He's pigheaded! You must have paid him well. Well enough. Did you leave anything for me? Are we good? Stop! Leave him alone! Tolya, I'm begging you. Please let him go. He gave it all back. We'll disappear, I swear. Tolya! I can't. I really can't. No, please don't! Vera, stop. Don't.
