Need to help necessarily. Nikolay, come in. Now there will be an announcement. Did you know, that as a result of many studies including mine personally, that ordinary earth day not at all organic for human mode. Our body lives in a different rhythm. This rhythm is called a 12-36 system. In order to organically enter into resonance with this rhythm, need 12 hours to sleep, Then 36 hours stay awake. That is, 12 hours of sleep, 36 hours of sleep. So many people live now: Cavers, astronauts, deputies. This is the only healthy. mode for a person. Oh, I did not understand anything. For our health from today we go to this system. 12-36. Accordingly, we do not sleep tonight. What for? That's why we sleep at night? Because it's night, dad. That's right, earthly night! But there is a cosmic night. The sun! The sun is not the only star, their billions! And the rhythms of the cosmos are much stronger than the rhythms of the sun. This, I hope, understand? That is, this night we do not sleep and do what we want, yes? Pa, are you serious? I look like someone who is not serious? No, I look like someone who is not serious? Dad, this is a great idea. Personally, I really like it. I'll be literally half an hour now, then come back and we all night we will not sleep. Okay? That's it, dad. Cool idea! Straight respect! Everything, I ran. Nikolay! Nikolay! Kolya, wait. 10 hours, today you will not go anywhere. Dad. Sasha, and maybe some water? Ira, this is a common cause and do it together. Dima, son! Come here, come here. Nikolai, take off your shoes. Forgive me please. Forgive me please, well that's just how do you imagine it? Children to school tomorrow, to work for me. I, too, to work. Ira, I also work all day. Yes at home. This is even worse. I'm like an astronaut in orbit! I have no picture change at all. Good. But what will we do at night? Well what? Here it is. You wanted a repair. We will do the repair. All this is crazy. Well, how do you know is it insane or not? Well, how's your date in the annex? How is your Simakova? Barely survived. So, it is necessary to enter the mode gradually. Weaklings. Yes, Stanislav Ilyich, cool computer center opened. Congratulations! Seryoga, your balloon? So, guys, we are going. Live, live, we have a call. Let's live! What's going on? Yes, this is a clear arson. What? Look at Stanislav Ilyich. And what? Look, eyes as they run! Speech, are you kidding? He is a teacher of computer science. Why does he need it? He is a hipster. Mac uses, and all computers were vindouzovye. These yablochniki, they, as sect. Took and burned. Speech, I started a novel. What? Alisa Denisovna, hello. Kolya, not now. OK I understood. Kohl, let's go talk. Good. Quickly all to school! Lessons have not been canceled! Quickly! Cool coincidence, huh?

Ksyusha, you are the main thing, do not be offended. Yes, I do not mind, I do not care. No, I just thought ... You're a fool. Objectively speaking. And we would still in in the end nothing happened and you still have Baghdasar. Are you dating him and I would only disturb you. And then, I am now aiming at some more adult relationships. But thank you anyway. Are you not afraid that I will tell everyone? What will you tell? What have you set fire to the school? I did not set fire to anything. Like this?
