"What blossoms in a young woman's heart is that a rhythm?" "Heart's desires are like the varieties in flowers." "A bird's song and it's vibes" "Is the dawn's welcome." 'For us Janu always meant singing,' 'But for her, singing was everything!' 'She used to either sing or talk about that song.' 'Like the pitch, rhythm, tempo, etc' 'We never understood anything.' Hey! wait even I am coming. 'Apparently, when Janu was in her mother's womb itself' 'They had decided to name the baby, after famous singers,' 'SP. Balasubramaniam if a boy and S.Janaki if a girl.' 'Such was their family's affinity towards music.' 'Wonder, what it was about that day, they named her Janaki Devi' 'She never sang any other songs, other than that of S.Janaki.' 'Except one!!!' In all directions, echoed the tamilian pride!!! Hail!!! The Tamilian!!! 'Sometimes while listening to certain songs on the radio' 'It sounded like Janu's songs being sung.' 'Her voice her face is what, used to come to my mind.' 'So it wasn't just her singing' 'I was fond of Janu, herself!' 'Even she knew that.' 'That was the only reason why my attendance was a 90%' 'She was the reason.' 'We have literally been studying together from our kindergarten days.' 'From then till today, I always listen to whatever she says!' 'Even she used to ask only me, if she wanted anything.' 'There were days I used to be sad,...' 'mulling over my poor marks and other things.' 'No one else would have noticed, but Janu would come to me,' 'and just ask, what happened?' 'That was enough!' 'That one word had the power of ten elephants.' 'It set my heartbeat racing!!!' 'Spirited enough to go bash up a bunch of harmless guys.' 'I really can't explain what Janu meant to me' 'The only thing I would pray for, when I go to the temple is' 'God!' 'Always keep Janu within my eyesight!' - Hemalatha - Present Miss - Jumshek - Present Miss Janaki Janaki Devi Absent Miss - Jai Ganesh - Present Miss - Murali - Present Miss - S.Nityanadanam - Present Miss - Nanda Gopal - Present Miss - Raj Mohan - Present Miss - K.Ramachandran - Present Miss - Sathish - Present Miss - Subashini - Present Miss Today we are going to see about cell biology Cell means small It can basically, functionally, biologically Also known as, living organisms Why, you are looking so grumpy?

With your thoughts elsewhere, don't neglect your studies. You should study well, okay? Do you want to ask me anything? Are you scared? Okay, shall I leave now. What happened? Did he say something? - Did you say something? - No. Why are all of you making so much of noise? Janu, you come here. Ask her to sing 'By the banks of the river Yamuna'. Janu. He is requesting you to sing 'By the banks of the river Yamuna'. "I am a small girl, I am a flower." "I am a lotus, I am a new honey bowl." "I am jaggery, I am a silver chariot." "I am a calf, I am the fresh rainy season." Hey! I told her. She's doing this on purpose. He's asking you to sing 'By the banks of the river Yamuna'. Sister, he has taken my geometry box and wants you to sing some song. I don't understand what is so special about that song. He's asking you so many times to sing that song, what are you going to lose? Janu, a fan request? By the banks of the river Yamuna from the film 'Thalapathy'. Please sing, the song Mr Messenger Please go tell Mr Fan, that even on 'All India Radio', songs are played, only when directly requested by the fan. Okay! Murali! Is it okay? Now watch the fun! "The eyes that spill poetry, shut !" "The feet sing a colourful song!" "In Lord Kannan's chariot with desire!" "Yearning drowns in blissful toddy!" "In love" "Inside the love nest" "the love bird caresses!" 'After that, I tried so many different methods,' 'asking her, but she never sang that song.'

Okay then, I will leave now. Don't forget me. Happy holidays How do you know she's coming? I have been incessantly messaging and calling her for the past one week. Not a single reply from her. I got annoyed and stopped calling her. Then? Suddenly she texted this morning, saying, she's coming. - You didn't even tell me this - Hey... It's not like I did not want to tell you She's got to come all the way from Singapore. Thought I'd just wait till she reaches here. Come here. Look at him, still behaving like a 10th standard kid. Only thing missing is the school uniform. Come here, or else I will break your hand. Dude, like you're a saint. Hey! Janu has come. Hey Janu, how are you? Here take this and share it with everyone. Yeah, say thank you Thank you Hey! Subha has come, go see her. What dude? Sorry got a little delayed. Thank God! You at least came now. This itself is a relief. Come. Finally I've come, you happy now. How are you? I am fine. - How are you? - Come, sit. I am fine. How many months now? 7 months. This is my second one. I never expected so many of them to come. All your doing is it? Everyone did their bit. Don't even ask. Even I never expected. I thought they would just nod in agreement, and then ditch us. Thank God, I had organized some extra food. Everyone has come. He has had so many ice creams from the time we came. Hey! just ask him how many... Go I never thought you would come. Hey! buffalo! Hey! why you behaving like a kid? Standing here with a balloon. Come. You go. You come. You go. Janu has come. You come now. You go. Go. - Hey! shut up and come. - Hey! you go. Hey! I have grown older! And you're hitting me like, you used to in school. Leave now or...just leave. Get lost, you savage! Get lost! Last summer we were in Singapore, my husband and son. If I had known you were there, I would have definitely come and met you. Do you have a photograph of your daughter? Show me... Hey! where is he? If I call him, he's hitting me, you go call him, yourself. Hey! what is this.. What happened? Hmm... Ram has come. He is hiding over there. Hey, Janu - Hi - Hi How are you? - I am fine. - How are you? - Hi, Janu - Hi, Janu You didn't respond to my greeting Sorry...sorry How was the Vaitheeswaran temple? It was nice. Good morning, Miss - Aasai Thambi - Present Miss - Anbu Selvan - Present Miss - Anu Radha - Present Miss - Aravindan - Present Miss - Arun Kumar - Present Miss - Bhavani - Present Miss - Bala Murugan - Present Miss - Devanadan - Present Miss - Janaki Devi - Present Miss - Jai Ganesh - Present Miss - Karuppaswamy - Present Miss - Murali - Present Miss - Nandhani - Present Miss - Priyadharshini - Present Miss - Raj Mohan - Present Miss - Rajesh Kanna - Present Miss - Sathish - Present Miss - Selvam - Present Miss - Shyam Sunder - Present Miss - Sowmiya - Present Miss - Subashini - Present Miss - Udhaya Shankar - Present Miss Miss, you never called out K.Ramachandran's name. His name is not in the register. Maybe he is in some other department. Check it during the interval. He's not here also. I thought he would be in your class. K.Ramachandran He has taken his Transfer Certificate. Did you not know? Why would he have taken the Transfer Certificate? Hey! you call him your brother, don't you know? I promise I don't know anything. I came back from Kumbakonam only this morning. Why, without telling us? Just can't understand Hey! nothing to worry! Let's go to his house in the evening, Then everything will be clear. Brother! What you doing there? It's locked. Ram? What? Krishnamoorthy uncle! Isn't there anyone in the house? Krishnamoorthy is it? How do I tell you that! Apparently his dad was in a lot of debt and... wasn't able to return the money. So they had to sell the house. It was built by his grandfather. So, they did not want anyone to know. That's why, they packed their bags over night and left to Chennai. No one knows anything else. Really sad, even he and his mother came to know about it only that night. "Why..." "Did he leave without saying anything?" "Why..." "Did he not close yesterday's chapter?" "In the Grey skies..." "I search for my clouds." "The time is like a riddle," "My path is filled with tears." "Far away it has gone..." "The music of love." "Every tear that drops," "Is my prayer in search." "He left the town I heard" "My eyes looked here and there." "He left my very roots I realized" "That truth caused mayhem within!" "The music was over." "Where is your silence?" "The burden of tears are becoming my eternal companion." "Tomorrow seems to burn." "Where is my morning?" "Wings are filled with rocks." "Till I die on the ground." Ram Hi You recognize me? Janu. How are you Ram? I am fine. How are you? This is unbelievable, right? That we would meet like this. It's been 20 years. No actually 22 years. I can't recognize you at all. When we saw each other the last time, you did not even have a moustache. What are you doing now Ram? Travel... Travel photographer - What happen? - I am ok. You keep quiet. Hey! I left the kid with you for 5 minutes, and look what you did. Thanks You want anything else? You sit down. - First you drink the water. - Ok I will drink. You're ok? She's come after so many years and this is what you do! I slipped and fell. Did he say anything to you or the minute he saw you... Sorry She has come all the way from Singapore. Can't you enquire about her? Instead of behaving like a kid. She's married and has a daughter. Did you ask her about all that? You're a real moron! Have you all eaten? Why have you not eaten? Normally I don't eat anything on flights. Is it? Hey nutcase! Go run and touch that tree and get back. - Go! - Why? Okay. Hello! Is it Dubai? If you come back fast, run again. Okay Hey! What is this? This is not right am warning you My dear sister in law, is this a bribe for me or is it for... My man's sister, take a walk slowly and go touch that tree and come back. Go. Thank you - You, not eating? - No, you eat. Phone Hey! Answer the call. Sir, yes, tell me sir. Hey! What is this? They seem to be heading somewhere else. Yes sir. Even I noticed sir. Looks like they have picked up, from where they left, at school. Yes sir, even I feel the same sir. Hope it doesn't cause any problem. We come imagining one thing and something else happens. Nothing like that will happen sir. You don't worry. You haven't eaten. Finish this. Thanks - Hey! - Hmm... What is happening there! How would I know? Nothing wrong will happen, no? - I am not thinking about that. - Then? If something, happens between these two here, and her husband back in Singapore get's to know... If both of us being the organizers, get caught Then it will be a real celebration for us! You shut up! I thank all of you, who have come. I have something to say, to those who have not come, you have missed a beautiful opportunity in life. We don't know when and where, something like this will happen again. Finally on behalf of 'The All Saint's School', batch of'96, I invite our class favourite, Janu, on to the stage to say a few words. Our golden girl! Our kind hearted lioness! Our Singapore, Princess! Thanjavur's dancing doll! We are all slaves to your songs! Your walk is like a chariot in procession! When you talk it's poetry! Janu, you speak my darling! Hey! You keep quiet! I'm so happy I feel I have become half my age. I came thinking everything and everyone would have changed. But nothing has changed. I feel like wearing my blue and white uniform, and go to school with all of you again. Thanks Hey Janu! Sing a song before you leave. I just had an ice cream. That's okay. Just sing, no one's giving you a prize. Hey Murali! Ask her to sing 'By the Banks of the river Yamuna...' How can I? Please...Please... Ask her to sing, 'By the Banks of the river Yamuna' "Without anyone saying anything Flowers still emit fragrance." "Without any bond Two hearts are speaking." "Without anyone saying anything The bird's song oozes honey." "Without anything The heart tastes, as sweet as ever!" "The water cascades through And the world moves similarly." "Everything runs by Similarly time passes by." "What doesn't stay still Are the colours of the mind!" One Two Three Hey! Anyone's got a handkerchief? Here it Okay, ready Hey! look here. Did you see our protector? Hey! I am asking you, did you see our protector? When are you coming back again from Singapore? It will take some time. - Have you been there? - No I haven't. I like your hair I like yours too You know, with what great difficulty, I got permission for this place? It's really expensive! These Chinese bulbs are expensive too, you get them only in China. These caterers... My head is aching. Get me a coffee on the way. Shall we leave, the car has come. Let's go. How long you staying in India? Not staying, tomorrow early morning is my flight. What's the hurry? In the last minute I did not even get a ticket. Only got a connecting flight. Have to go to Trichy and board. You could have planned to stay for 4 or 5 days. Even I feel the same now. Then what, stay and go. I have left my daughter and come. She won't be without me. - What's her name? - Meera. Here take a look. Hey! show me. She looks very cute. Hey! show me. It was taken there is it? Should visit these places at least once before I die. Here. Hey Janu! he's checking out your daughter, in front of you. Does she look like me, during our school days? Everyone says that. This is why brother, you should get married at the right time. That's why you're still looking at school kids. He still is not married? Nope Who will give their daughter's hand to a wanderer! Why you still not married? That is... Because... Dad's looking for a girl for me. Hey Ram! Take the car out. We will come. Okay! Okay! Finish your coffee. I'll wait in the car. Hey! You finished your coffee? Your headache has gone? Then get up. It's getting late. Give that. Come I am asking you...

You're always with him, is it not? - Dad... - What dad? Sathish, am asking you Why is he not married yet? Since you're going with them You drop her first and then you get dropped. What are you seeing there? Don't think too much. Go. 'Intermission' Hey! Which route are you taking? Don't you have to drop Janu, first? No, first I will drop you. - Hey! That's a very long route. - No, who told you, that's only shorter. Yeah right! Adayar is closer to Valasarawakkam and... far from St Thomas Mount is it? Nonsense! Shall I check Google maps and tell you. No use, the routes he takes never appear on the maps. Hey! Were you serious or were you joking! I was serious only. Careful. Okay, bye Am warning you, go drop her right now, and get home! - Understood? - Don't have unnecessary thoughts. Just a few words, till I drop her, that's it. Don't you know me. Get lost!

Will kill you, you rascal!!! So you will talk to me, only if Subha is not around? Ram. Why are you still not married? What's the hurry! I'll, slowly... Ram Am seriously asking you. Why haven't you married as yet? Let's say no one came forward. I am begging you Ram, please tell me. Even if it's because of me it's okay, just tell me. I need to know. Tell me, why haven't you married as yet? Ram. Are you going to tell me now or no? Janu, we have reached your hotel. Ram, are you going to drop me now? No...no... Subha told me to... Don't you feel like talking to me at all ? No... no..nothing like that. I will pick you up in the morning and drop you at the airport. Take my number. Janu, am not purposely... "Beautiful memories are becoming bitter." "Won't my distances ever vanish?" "Yearnings of my soul are tearing me apart!" "Won't the past ever return?" "Looking and yet not looking" "Will my heart, forever live like that?" "The cowardice of words are like..." "The harp without a melody." "Beautiful memories are becoming bitter." "Won't my distances ever vanish?" "Within the principles of love..." "The rules are changing..." "Emotions are taking over!!!" "My burdens are disappearing into thin air." "The destination seems to have a hundred paths..." "To become one with you!!!" "Shall I bask as the moon of your love?" "To be cheated in the break of dawn?" "In this glorious night, come and live..." "Hoping the dawn that breaks is ours my love!!!" What is it, Janu? Ram... Have you left? Tell me Janu, you need anything? No, where are you? Janu? Have you gone too far?... Have you gone too far, Ram? I've been standing right where I left you!!! Is it wrong, that I wanted to talk to you? Sorry 22 years!!!... Hey! Thanks Janu... Now tell me, where do you want to go? - Yes Subha? - Where are you? - Near Guindy. - Have you dropped her? Yes. Dropped her and am on my way. Did she say anything? Not really, as she was just enquiring about my parents, we reached the hotel, I dropped her and left. Oh! Okay. Alright! you don't keep thinking about anything, go sleep. I'll call you in the morning. Hello Where you? I... I am in my room. What time is your flight tomorrow morning? 5.50 am. You're going to Trichy and leaving from there, is it? Yes, from here to Trichy, there to Singapore. Okay, call me after you reach. - At least text me. - Okay, sure. Okay, bye Now tell me, where shall we go? Let's go somewhere. Somewhere...? I really don't know, you suggest. Why you asking me? How will I know? Go, anywhere. In moment of bravado, I asked you out. Honestly, I've never been anywhere. You better suggest, where to go. Shall we go to a salon? Salon? "If you go inside the Nesapakam market, the road will curve towards the left," then it divides into a fork, take the right there. Stop intruding, then how can you hear what I am saying. So, after you take the right at the fork, take the second right, you will hit a corporation bank. On the same road, it's the third house. If you go ring the bell, a nice, plump woman, will come and open the door. That's the owner's wife. Yes. Oh! the water is it? It will be red in colour. In Nesapakam, that's how the colour of the water will be. If you want crystal clear water, you have tolook in places like KK nagar and Valasarawakkam. - Did you cut your hair anywhere else? - No! Okay, I'll talk to you later. I have an serious issue to deal with now. - I know him from long back. - I'll speak later I know him from long back? Is that how you would say it! Shouldn't you say, you know me, even before your beard blended with your moustache? His father used to bring him here, as a little boy, and tell me to cut it really short, and this one, used to tell me to keep it long. When he was new to Madras, whenever he saw a Thanjavur bus, he used to come here and sit with a long face. Brother! Crazy boy! Okay, tell me, how should I cut his hair? Like actors, Rajini or Kamal? Or like Vijay or Ajith or like Surya? That's why I am asking? Uncle, cut his hair, like a 10th standard boy. I am gone. Which year? '94. Oh! okay! Oh! '94 is it? Should I really have to shave my beard? Where you coming? It's like a bear, it will take time to sculpt. Sit and watch the fun. - You sit down. - You turn this side. You have lost half your weight. Don't close your eyes. Okay? Double okay Okay you sit. Let's put two plaits for you. Oh no! I don't want. Okay, now leave the shop I need to close it. Okay you wait , I'll come now. - Who did you think she is? - I am wise enough. I can understand everything. - What do you understand? - I can understand. That's what, what do you understand? Shall we go? Remove your shirt. After all you're wearing a T Shirt inside. It has sleeves, right? Then remove it. No...hmm... Hey! Just remove it! See how this looks! You and your beard and the worn out shirt! What? What Janu? Hey! hey! hey! What?!!! Hey! hey! Janu. What is it? Ram Are you a virgin? Are you a virgin? Yuck, is this way to ask, though? Is it true? After going to Singapore, you have become spoilt... - Let's go now. - That's alright. You answer my question. It's getting late, first let us leave from here. - Are you going to tell me or not? - Hey! hey! hey! My shirt is getting crushed. Then answer me. Thought you can evade all my questions and escape? Now what do you want to know? Whether... Whatever be it, let's go talk about it in the car. Please Janu Go. Come, stand here. Now, tell me. Okay! Let me spit this out! First swear on God, and tell the truth. Janu, one shouldn't swear about such things. Liar! Don't I know about you. You would have cooked up a story, by the time you came from there to here. Swear on me. Okay, now tell. Yes! I am a virgin only, Janu. Holy! Smokes! You insisted, so I told. Now just leave it at that. But why? Because I have committed to Lord Hanuman. Now get into the car. But how... Now what do you want... Oh! Now your ego is getting hurt is it? Buffalo! Do you know how old you are? Please change the topic. I am feeling very shy. Okay, leave that. In all these years, have you not fallen in love with anyone? Can't really say that. I was expecting this. Finally the truth is coming out. What? Girls, will really like guys like you. How did they miss out? - Guys, like, me? - Yes! What do you mean by guys, like, me? Hey! You're this raw, oozing manhood, kinda guy! Why? Hasn't anyone told you this? Okay, enough of smiling, come to the story. - There was a girl called Charu. - Full name? Charumathi. She was my junior in college. Nice girl. Beautiful to look at. While studying in college, I had no idea about her feelings. After college got over, one day she called on my landline, and wanted to talk to me. She said, her parents were looking out for a groom for her. I congratulated her on that. She got angry. After that she bluntly asked if I was interested, so she could talk to her parents. What did you say? What to say? For me to understand what she was saying itself was... Okay. What did you say? What do you expect me to say? I told her, that am jobless, penniless, etc. - Then? Then? - She was stubborn. I had no options left. Finally I told her the truth. What is that? I told her about you. She was silent for a while. Then she took a deep breath and left. After three months, she sent me her wedding invitation. Then she called me. She told, forget what happened and come for the wedding. She said she will be expecting me. Did you go? Whatever said and done, I am someone she liked. Poor thing. I did not want to make her feel awkward. So I did not go. Back then, why you left without telling? Why did you not come to see me again? Nothing made sense to me. I couldn't even ask anyone. Neither could I forget you. I completely neglected my studies. It was a miracle, that I even passed my 12th. I got scared my parents would get me married, so I completed my degree properly. Even then, every time I met any of our school friends... I used to wait eagerly to see if, they would say something about you. If someone like you, tall and dark passed by, I would hope, it would be you and follow them many times, but in vain. To add to all this.. my sister eloped and got married. Two months after that, my marriage was fixed. With the hatred my father was harboring for my sister. I could not even, go and speak to him about anything. Even if I had spoken, what could have I told him? That I was in love with a guy till the 10th standard, but I don't know where he is now? Even on my wedding day... Something within told me, you will come for me. Now if I say all this, it would sound very dramatic. Even while I was seated as a bride, I felt your presence in the wedding hall. I thought, just like how it happens in films. You would stop the wedding, and ask for your Janu. I was hoping you would take me with you. But, nothing like that happened. Only my wedding took place. After that I was heartbroken. Till date... whenever heart is heavy... my only refuge... is my 10th standard K.Ramachandran's face. What happened? Sir, it's getting late, I have to close the gates. If you take the car out, I'll close the gates. Sit down. Sorry Ram. These are things I wanted to tell you, someday when I meet you. Who else can I share these things with. That's why I poured my heart out. Please don't think I am trying to make you feel guilty. Okay? No... The fact that I came to your college... and sent a message, saying that I wanted to see you, don't you know any of that? When did you come? Don't tell lies, Ram. I came, Janu. Don't play the fool, Ram. Really, did you come? One minute. Ask her. Please could you call Janaki Devi, second year Bsc computer science. I need to talk to her. Is it anything to do with love? No sister, it's not what you think. They both have been in love, ever since school. There happened to be a break in the middle... It's a ladies college, otherwise we ourselves would have... We have come all the way from Madras. Just inform her, that would do. Just for this, have come all the way from Madras? Yes sister. We both are classmates. I feel bad for you guys. I will help you. Are you sure there won't be any trouble? No nothing will happen sister. We just want to see her and talk to her once. That's all. Please. What did you say her name was? S. Janaki. One minute. - Do you know her? - I don't know. Hey! Just write her dad's name as well... Our bad luck, there could be two Janaki Devis. You leave. What did you say your name was? K. Ramachandran. Hey! Where are you going? Janaki Devi? That's me. His name... There is one boy, waiting outside, to meet you. What? Are you a messenger for love? Are you coming to college for this? If you're not interested in studying, tell me. I will take you to the principal and get you, your Transfer Certificate. Hey! Next time you come to me, carrying such messages... I will give you one tight slap. She saw you from there, and yelled at me badly. Don't know what the problem is. Maybe... If you had spoken to her directly, things would have been better, I suppose. Just do me one more favour, please. Just tell her, I will never trouble her again. - Let's go. - Hey! Why you being hasty? Let her come out, we will talk to her directly. No need. No, anything could have happened in these three years. The least we can do is, to not trouble her. Hey, did we come so far, just for this? Sorry, I did not ask you, for your name? Vasanthi. Thanks Get on. Sir, come this side - Which room? - 318, third floor. Don't come inside. No...no...no... I won't ...am standing outside the bedroom. - Janu are you okay? - Ram, I did not see you that day. I...did not see you... Okay...Okay... I swear that day, I never saw you. I never saw you. I never saw you. Never saw... Never saw... - Janaki Devi? - That's me. Hmm...his name? One boy is waiting outside to see you. What are you? A messenger for love? Are you coming to college for this? Once more, you come with any such messages... I will give you one tight slap! If we were not meant to be together... then why... And look at you, because of me, you're also in this state... First of all, how could I believe, that you would hate me. Whatever it was, I should have, waited and seen you. I was hasty. That day, if only that girl had mentioned your name... Everything would have been different! It's all my fate. Why should we get to know the truth now? What we believed to be the truth, could have remained the actual truth. You have also been thinking about me. I would have never known that you came to see me. In this pain, that is soothing. How come you never said anything when you were with me, but out of the blue, decided to come after three years to say it? Actually, every day I used to think of it. But something will stop me. That I am not fair skinned like Janu. I can't sing like Janu. I used to keep thinking like that. That particular day, I don't know what happened. I felt like I would die if I don't tell you. Some courage within me that day, like never before. I travelled, all the way to your college and was standing there, for you. I wanted to ask you. How did you know I was studying in that college? What kind of question is this? Somehow I know. But how? After all you were in Madras. I had different people for everything. I used to come to know everything, that happens to you. If I felt like seeing you, I would come to Thanjavur. I would follow you, from college back home, and if I came too close, I would go hide. The only thing, that I did not know, was that you saw someone else and not me that day and got angry. Apart from that I know everything about you. What do you know? Let me hear it. If you say anything wrong... Your 10th standard marks were 836. Your 12th standard marks were 990. Your b'day dress you would wear it on my b'day! Your favourite deity is lord Muruga! You stop singing after I left town. You wanted to study Tamil Literature, but your father paid up for Bsc Computer Science. You did not eat for two days because of that. Your father was never aware of that. I meant to say, your father did not know, but I knew. In 1998 you had typhoid and, in 2000 you had jaundice. The timing was so bad, both the, times was when you had exams. Remember, when you were in college, one curly haired loafer was stalking you. He who was beaten up by someone, and admitted in hospital, which also became a police case? It was me, who had hit him. I only hit him. Around that time, apart from me, three other guys were in love with you. Then, for your college annual day, for the first time you wore a saree and came. Dark blue in colour. You were scared that your saree may come out and, at the same time you were blushing, as though everyone was looking at you. Do you know how you looked... Do it once more. After that I saw you in a saree only at your wedding. Deep purple in colour. Just like you had thought, I had come for your wedding, Janu! I was standing in a corner amidst the crowd. I just couldn't wait till the knot was tied. I ran as far away as possible, from the wedding hall and all that noise. Coffee? - Come - Hello, sir Sorry sir, is it too late? No, you are right on time. Leave it. - Shall I pour, sir? - No, no, I'll do it. - Okay sir - Thanks Okay Janu, I'll leave. After you drink, get some sleep. I'll come at 3.30, you get ready and come down. Okay. I want to speak to you about something, come here. No...no... whatever it is, you say it from there. Nonsense, come and sit down. It's taken me 22 years to see this idiotic face. That too, just for a night. I should really thank God for this. I will do that tomorrow. Don't tell me to sleep tonight. I want to be with you. I want to talk to you. That's all. Okay What? "Yearnings take shape and touch me..." "Burning the beauty..." "Cradling me like a mother!" "The language of the eyes, follow a path which leads to the story." "Yearnings take shape and touch me..." "Burning the beauty..." "Cradling me like a mother!" "The language of the eyes," "and the language of the lips form a never ending story." "Won't time become a horse at night?" "Same dream! Same question!" "Won't the skies caress and embrace and dance?" "The same moon, is coming closer." "Yearnings take shape and touch me..." "Burning the beauty..." "Cradling me like a mother!" "The language of the eyes," "and the language of the lips form a never ending story." "Am I the fire that gets wet?" "Are you the raining moon?" "Will I be extinguished?" "Am I the waning musical note?" "Is love just a never ending dream?" "Is the never ending journey not enough?" "Is time a question alone?" "That is enough." "My heart melts in longing to come closer to you." "Yearnings take shape and touch me..." "Burning the beauty..." "Cradling me like a mother!" "The language of the eyes," "and the language of the lips form a never ending story." Oh God! - What happened? - My students. Okay. So, what? What? If they see us together... Okay, just check if they are looking this side. They aren't looking, but they are leaving now. But, don't they have to go out this way? Oh! Yeah! Okay, I will go and hide in the bathroom, will you call me, after they leave? Please Thanks Sir this is the kitchen. - Bathroom - Washroom is there. Hi, sir This look, is stunning! I couldn't recognize you from there. I thought it was some young guy. What are you doing here at this hour? Sir it's Abhi's b'day, so we came to cut cake. Learn everything properly. Okay? Won't your parents, say anything, you being out at this hour? All of you have come alone at this hour? Go reach home safely. Sir, is that your wife? Hey! I never said anything... I never said anything. We are Ram sir's students. I know, he just told me. Actually, we had no clue that sir is married. He never told us. I never said anything. Nothing like that. Because it was a love marriage, we did not tell anyone. Love marriage!!! Is it? Why? What happened? We can't believe that he is married even. And now you're saying it was a love marriage. So mean! Why you saying this? Since, he is so strict in class. We can't talk, we can't look at each other, and we can't even laugh. Hey! That's enough! You will go on talking... Leave...leave...leave now... - Why you threatening them? - It's getting late. Come, all of you come and sit. Look at him ma'am, even in front of you... I will take care of that, you continue. - Where did I stop? - Shouldn't laugh. Oh yes, we shouldn't laugh... we shouldn't even wear sleeveless... Even my father is better than this, ma'am. Okay, okay...he's like that only. I will tell him to be more gentle with girls, okay? That's alright ma'am, but how did sir fall in love? Our love started, way back from our school days, from the 10th standard. School days is it? Who proposed first, ma'am? Sir, you're feeling shy? Ma'am, when did you accept, the proposal? The same day, at that very moment... at once!!! What is this ma'am! For your beauty, you should have made him, chase you for a week. That too sir, you could have kept him waiting for a month. At that time he meant everything to me. Even now! Please ma'am, tell us how sir proposed? We won't ask you anything else, we will leave. Birthday wish, please Tenth standard, went by very merrily. I was always smiling. After that, Ram left to Madras suddenly. Without even telling me. All the smiles turned to tears. Even after I joined college, I could never forget him. It used to be very painful. But something within kept telling me, my Ram, will come one day. He will definitely come for me. Sometimes though nothing happens around you, you will still have a gut feeling that something is going to happen. That's how I was feeling that day! Excuse me, just a minute. 2nd year Bsc Computer Science, S. Janaki Devi, can you please call her. I need to talk to her. Is it about love? Yes. Are you sure there won't be any trouble? What's your name? Vasanthi. Vasanthi, you don't get scared. Just go tell S. Janaki Devi of 2nd year Bsc Computer Science, that K. Ramachandran has come. Vasanthi, thanks S.Janaki Devi? Someone called K.Ramachandran is waiting for you. What happened after that, is something, which I yearned, that it would happen in my dreams atleast. My Ram, had come in search of me. In one second my world had changed. The minute I heard K.Ramachandran's name, my entire being shook! I couldn't even walk, but, I was running. "Come to me my entirety!!!" "You ..." "Are my seven musical notes..." "My Five great elements..." "My heart is brimming!!!" "Whatever I see..." "Is love..." I was seeing him after three years. The school boy face had gone. A Lion of a man, with a beard and a moustache, was at the gates!!! For me. For Janu. But, I had by hearted certain questions, which I desperately wanted to ask the day I see him. But... Janu! "Love... Love..." "Is the biggest lonely companion!" "Come with me... Come with me..." "That is more than enough." "Love... Love..." "Till the end of life..." "Lets travel... Come with me.!!!" Okay, enough of listening to stories. It's getting late. You people should leave. Leave...leave...leave... Hey! come here. Can't you be happy cutting a cake at 10pm back at home? Is it a must to come out and cut at 12pm? Okay, leave now. Go reach safely and text me. - You both look made for each other, sir. - Shut up! Leave! Chatter box! - Hey! - I will take care. You leave. You want a special invitation is it? Leave! Good night, Ma'am Good night, sir Good night Leave. Where next? If you won't mistake me, I want to ask you something? Oooooh! What is it? Your hotel is far off from here. Okay. No, it's alright, let's go. Stop it, and just say it. It's just that, the hotel is far from here, where as my house is close by. What did you think about me, Ram? No...no... sorry...sorry.. I did not mean it that sense, Janu. I promise. That's why I was hesitant to ask earlier. Okay let's go to the hotel. Shall I book a cab? I promise... There is this woman who tries to entice sage Vishwamitra... What's her name? Menaka. Yeah, and with her there will two more women... What are their names? Ramba and Urvashi. Yeah. Well, we can entrust you with those three women, in those same minimalistic outfits, for a night!!! You won't do anything majorly, in fact, you will take care of them safely. That's because I've shaved off my beard and moustache, you're feeling that way. Oh! really... and if you hadn't shaved? Even then you will feel the same. Okay, let's walk. How do we go to your house? Come let's go. That side. That one. Hey! Any girls as neighbours? Yes there are. Come in with your right foot. You're something... K.Ramachandran's house, is it? - Oh no! It's become wet. - That's alright. The house is nice. Where is the bathroom? Go straight and the bedroom is on the left. You go, I will get a towel and come. Janu, shall I leave the soap and towel here, at a reachable distance? Why? There is one here. Oh! no! I have used that one. Do you have psoriasis or something? No...no... nothing like that. Just dry these. Ram, I have to tell you something. You have to listen. You shouldn't stay like this. You should get married. You should have a family of your own. I want see your children. I want to pet and pamper them. I want to see if their eyes have your semblance... Whether their nose has your semblance... I want to see and enjoy all that. I want to see your wife. I want to know who your wife is going to be. I want to tell her something, That no women will get a gem of a guy like you! So she better take great care of you. I literally want to warn her. I definitely will! You want to eat? Shall I order something? Even in the hotel, you did not eat anything. Not hungry. I am hungry. Is it okay? It's like my mother's cooking. Janu, are you happy? Hmm... After many years. Idiot! I did not mean now. I was asking, whether you're generally happy in life? What is this? You're asking me, like my mother would. I just felt like asking. If you don't want to tell, don't tell. It was difficult in the beginning. I got caught alone in Singapore. I won't know what to do, every day I used to stand in front of God and cry. But he's a very nice person. A very good father to my daughter. Without me saying much, he understands me. No problem as such. If you're asking me if I am happy... I would say I am peaceful. But, at this moment I feel like saying something, but I won't. Janu, you don't get up. Just stay there. You may stumble upon something. Just stay there. I will just come now. "On the banks of the river Yamuna, as the cool breeze blows..." "I dance with Lord Kannan..." "The eyes blossom, looking at the path..." "Young Radha wilts." "The night has gone by, the day has gone by..." "The King is not with me." "The young girl's unblinking eyes..." "Search, here and there..." "Lord Kannan is not to be seen in the cow herding grounds ." "Falling in love, is a painful joy." "Lord Kannan is not to be seen in the cow herding grounds ." "Falling in love , is a painful joy." "Poor Radha!" What's all this? Memories! Wow! That old aroma! How come you have, kept all this safely, for so long? Your's. Mine? How did this come to you? Yeah, it grew legs and came! I flicked it. So I can keep it as memory of you. But how? You would leave your shawl in class, when you go for the P.T period. So, I kept following, planned it... and one day, flicked it. This is what I got. Careful...careful...careful... Hey! - Nothing...nothing...nothing... - Then why you snatching it? Love letter is it? No. Are you kidding me! Poetry is it? About me, is it? Give it to me. No, Janu... If you read it, you will start laughing. I am feeling shy. Hey! hey! Who is going to write poetry about me? Only you will write about me. Okay! You read it yourself. Read. Girl, are you a sea full of waves? My heart yearns, for your next wave! Does a fish basket and a flower shop require an advertisement? Is an attendance register required to know your arrival? Apparently we will lose our eyesight if we see the lightening. We lose our eyesight if we see the lightening. But when I see your eyes lightning enters me! But when I see your eyes lightning enters me! If you belong to your mother who carried you for ten months... If you belong to your mother who carried you for ten months... Then you also belong to me, for I have carried you in my heart for ages! Ram! Haven't you slept? Okay, come up. Up? No I always sleep on the floor. I am comfortable... Just come up. Hey! Tell me your email id... your height, weight...etc Why? - Let's fix a girl, for you today. - No, don't want. Why not? Look here, after being in love with a girl like S.Janaki, I can't marry any other girl. Why not? I was also in love with K.Ramachandran, and did I not marry M.Saravanan. Everything is possible. Tell me. Is it time? Another 15 minutes to go. That girl told me something at the restaurant. Yes, even I wanted to ask you. She was whispering into your ears. What is it? She said, sir is a very nice person, and to take care of him well. I know very well that sir's a nice person. But, she told me to take care of him well. I don't know what to do for that. Shall we leave? "The night, like an island..." "Is circling us..." "Even the break of dawn seems like darkness..." "Memories like fire are burning inside..." "The body cries, like it is death!" "Separation is my bond and I melt in it!" "I am separating from what breathes life into me!" "Like the rivers that flow from the mountains," "You flowed into my heart!" "In the barren land..." "You gave birth to a million seas!" "Let the dream be my only companion!" "The night, like an island..." "Is circling us..." "Even the break of dawn seems like darkness..." "This lotus, in spite of being in the pond , is lonely." "The sun basks in the warmth even when it's not day." "In one path...two souls are searching for their soul mates..." "Time is again and again placing obstacles!" "Living a life without you, is that a life at all!" "Come my life! Life is to live! you are the life within me...!" "Shall I come! Shall I come!" Thank you Ma'am Hope you have a pleasant stay "Every single day my heart comes alive..." "And dies that very day!" "Till the end of my life..." "My heart will celebrate you!" "Even when trees fall and nests shatter..." "Birds still sing their melody!" "Even when the night is over And almost done with..." "The moon still waits patiently!" "The rain drops reach the sea!" "The immortal love will reach Earth!" "Even when by body is away from you..." "My love will live with you forever!" "You take leave..." What? Let, me stay with you for a little more time. It's already late, Janu. Please, Ram Don't look like that. Okay, hold this. Where you going? Okay, wait, will come and tell you. I've taken a ticket for myself on the same flight as yours. Till you board the flight I will be with you. Okay. If you cry for this... Wipe your tears. Walk. Show me. Your id?
