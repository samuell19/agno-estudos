INDONESIA IS A COUNTRY WITH THE THIRD LARGEST TROPICAL FORESTS AND THE SECOND LONGEST COASTLINE IN THE WORLD. THIS ARCHIPELAGO PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THIS COUNTRY WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY IT. INDONESIA AIMS TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSION TO 29% BY 2030. WITH ITS DIVERSITY IN FAITHS, CULTURES, AND LANDSCAPES, SOME DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE WAYS. THESE ARE THE STORIES OF SEVEN COMMUNITIES FROM SEVEN PROVINCES. NYEPI IS A DAY OF SILENCE AND MEDITATION FOR BALINESE HINDUS. IN THE DAYS BEFORE NYEPI, PURIFICATION RITUALS ARE PERFORMED ACROSS THE ISLAND. Before we celebrate Nyepi, every village carries out purification rituals, called Melasti. Some do Melasti at sea, some at water springs. Melasti comes from two words. Male means impurities. Impurities of body and mind. Asti means cleansing. It's a process of cleansing ourselves and our environments, physically. Also spiritually, with rituals. Afterward, we do the Ngamet Amerta. Amerta is the source of life. After the Melasti ritual, we return to our temples. We prepare offerings and sprinkle holy water over the congregation. Here they are. All male groups? Please continue. It's full now. This is a universal thing, not just for Bali. When we do our rituals, we are not only doing it for Bali. It's for Buana Alit and Buana Agung. Buana Alit is people, the microcosmos. Buana Agung is nature, the universe. Good day. Be patient, it's a traffic jam. There are three basic natures in life: Buta, Kala, and Dewa. Buta is the passive nature. It's less active in life. Kala is like the animals, active but uncontrollable. Dewa is the controlling nature. It blesses and protects. Balance is the key in life. We achieve balance through control. Buta, Kala, and Dewa are inseparable. Without one, all will perish. Control is in the hands of human beings. That's why we are God's superior creation. We have intelligence. Also, we have to control the balance within ourselves. Being out of control will lead to destruction. And that is the expression of Buta and Kala's nature. During Nyepi, we must not do anything. After hard work, for example, we need to rest. If we have a good sleep, we will wake up fit and refreshed. Because during sleep, all the elements are rejuvenating. During Nyepi, Nature is restoring itself. Although it's only one day in a year, the impact is incredible on the macrocosms and microcosms. Whether we realize it or not, the vibration aligns itself in Nature's breath. DURING NYEPI, PEOPLE IN BALI ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOMES. THEY ARE ALSO NOT ALLOWED TO TURN ON THE LIGHTS FOR 24 HOURS. THAT DAY, EVEN THE AIRPORT IS CLOSED. Life is very simple, really, if we can just take time to contemplate. NYEPI SAVES 30,000 TONS OF CARBONS FROM THE ATMOSPHERE, REDUCING THE ISLAND'S DAILY EMISSIONS BY A THIRD. SUNGAI UTIK, WEST KALIMANTAN There's a trace here. Looks like they ate potatoes. I think they went that way. INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES MANAGE SOME OF THE WORLD'S BEST FORESTS. WITH RAPID DEFORESTATION, INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES ARE OUR BEST HOPE FOR FOREST PROTECTION. Where did you get boar? In Sungai Mawang. So far. Yes, it is. I got one boar. - Is it big? - Yes, it is. I live in Sungai Utik. The previous generations left us the forests to protect. On the map, Sungai Utik is 9,454.54 hectares in size. There are several zones in Sungai Utik. This is Kampong Taroh, the Sacred Forest. The government calls it the protective forest. This is Kampong Endor Kerja, the production forest. This is where we get our building material. This is Kampong Galao, the supply forest. The yellow one is Utilization Zone. For our daily lives. This one is our residential area. The message from our ancestors, who owned this place, whoever still lives here in Sungai Utik, they own the place. Whatever is in the forests, we own it. That's why we are protecting it. Thank you for your attendance. We will discuss the event preparation. PROMINENT INDIGENOUS PEOPLES &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST Apay Janggut cannot join us this evening. We pray for his recovery and our well-being. We will figure out how to finance the gawai. Let's not worry about money. The forests provide us everything. Medicines, ritual needs, we get it from the forests. We get our vegetables from the forests. The forests provide us food. Our forest is like a supermarket. We have rules for getting our supplies from the forests. We can't take anything irresponsibly, without permission or agreement from the community. We agree that a person can cut down three trees per year. With many illegal logging in other areas, we are getting more responsible for our forests. I think, if we don't hold on to our ancient beliefs, we will eventually lose our culture and tradition. Including forest protection. Experience has taught us about the impact of illegal logging on the neighboring villages. They exploited their forests. There was nothing left. They had nothing. The territory was no longer theirs. They couldn't hunt. They couldn't grow things. The water was dirty. But our community refuses to let go of our territory. We can still hunt. We still have our forests. Our water springs are well-protected. The forests include the water springs. Water is our source of life. There are animals we're not allowed to hunt. Such as hornbills and orangutans. We can hunt boars, deer, and mouse deer. We can't cut down trees in the Sacred Forest. We can't take anything from it. The Sacred Forest consists of sacred areas, like graves, big trees, and water springs. We have to protect them. It's hard to get fish now, unlike the old days. Hunting used to be easy. How is your uncle Apay Janggut? They say he's not well. I'm scared. My uncle is old. He's over 80 years old. Hopefully, he can join the gawai. Gawai is the harvest celebration. Harvesting started from February to May. This year's harvest is better than last year. So, tomorrow, the invited guests will come. Those who are not invited will also come. We have to welcome and serve them, according to our tradition. If the guests stay until late, we shouldn't go to sleep. Serve them drinks. We will serve the guests together. The young ones should be the ones to serve. APAY JANGGUT, A COMMUNITY LEADER IN SUNGAI UTIK, HAS BEEN AN ADVOCATE TO PROTECT THEIR FOREST. Apay Janggut once said, "The land is our mother," the water is our blood. When the land is used up, the plants will not give us seeds. "We have to protect it." We, the Sungai Utik people, are extending our invitation. We are calling the Highest Spirit. We are calling the God of Birds. We are calling the God of Land. We are performing the Gawai ritual. Please don't come empty-handed. Bring us the Stone of Knowledge. The Stone of Fertility and Prosperity. We are asking for fertile land. May this year bring us more fortune than last year and let us harvest our rice. IN THE LAST CENTURY, BORNEO HAS LOST 50% OF THEIR FORESTS TO DEFORESTATION. GLOBALLY, THE PROCESS CONTRIBUTES 15% OF EMISSION THAT CAUSES CLIMATE CHANGE. BEA MURING, EAST NUSA TENGGARA Ladies and gentlemen, dearly beloved. This morning, I have a message for you all. It is about the problem we are facing now. About our Earth. Pope Francis, in his encyclical Laudato si', praise be unto You. Pope Francis talks about taking care of our home, taking care of our Earth. Our Earth is in bad shape because it is changing. We have to love and protect it. Let's protect the flora, the fauna, and the land so the Earth can be prosperous. We have to return to the right ecological path. When I first came here, there was no electricity. Transportation access was limited. For lighting, most people used generators. Some used oil lamps. Dealing with generators was very stressful. In this area alone, there were 50 generators. You can imagine the air pollution. And also the loud noises. Then I had an idea: What if we use a different source of power? I wondered if there is a river around here. People told me there is a river here. Then, we should be able to generate electricity with water. It should last all night long, so we can enjoy better lighting. It's a new thing. We should give it a try. As church members, we developed this micro hydropower plant together. We have been told in church to take care of our environment. In the Book of Genesis, God tells us to protect and take care of His creation. Human beings are given control over Nature. But we also have the responsibility to take care of it. Now, the micro hydropower plant is six years old. Six years after we build it, the first big flood happened. The rain only lasted for two hours, but it led to such a big flood. According to the elderly, it was the first time it ever happened. Our Earth is going through some changes. Is this the levee? Yes, it is. Is it broken? Yes, it is. All the water went straight down. Really? Yes, all the way down. We couldn't go through because it was flooded. And then? We took the path down there. - Where? - The rock. That big rock? Yes. Then we went to the turbine house. When you went from the levee, how was the turbine house's condition? Bad. Very bad shape. It was a wreck. And the dynamo's condition? The dynamo? The sand got in. - The sand? - Yes. What's that? This was the one missing. The flood took it away. We found it, but it was all sandy. Lots of sand got into it, Father. Full of sand. The parts were crooked. - Good evening. - Good evening. Dear committee members. As we know, the micro hydro plant was damaged. The flood ruined parts of the levee. Then the turbine house was also damaged. And the dynamo. Without the levee, the turbine house is not safe. For all we know, another big flood might be coming. This disaster has brought us together. We know what it's like to live in the dark. MICRO HYDRO PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT In the name of the Father, Amen. - Good morning, everybody. - Good morning. So... Our micro hydro plant is damaged. If we don't fix it now, it might collapse, and we have to rebuild it. Some of the bricks are damaged. Part of the dynamo is missing because of the flood. As we can see on our way here, many of our electricity poles are deteriorated. Which brings us to budgeting. We need about 25,000 dollars. From us, by us, for us. All we have to do is divide it by our number. Alright. If so, it means everyone must chip in 180 dollars. Can we afford it? I'm just asking first. Can you get it this month? All right. If we think about it, if we lose hope, don't want to think hard, or are being selfish, we should just let this go. Because this is quite a task. But our contribution doesn't have to be money, right? We can contribute our manpower. Those who don't help out with labor can contribute money. So we're fighting together. We use our own manpower. This one's damaged, Father. So we should replace it. That's right. We have held a meeting to repair the micro hydro plant. We are relying on ourselves. So the community is not waiting for other people to change their lives. They are changing their own lives. And why are we so concerned about renewable energy development? By developing the micro hydro plant, the community knows how to take care of the environment, especially the water spring. One, two, three. Ladies and gentlemen. One message to you all: Everything on Earth is God's creation. Therefore, we have to take care of each other. We are God's creation. So let's protect the micro hydro plant. It's not about electricity but about how we treat the environment. We choose to take care of Nature. UTILIZING THE NATURAL FLOW OF WATER TO GENERATE POWER, MICRO HYDRO IS AN EMISSION FREE ENERGY RESOURCE. FOR 1.6 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WHO STILL LACK CONNECTION TO INDONESIA'S POWER GRID, IT IS A CLEANER, GREENER SOLUTION. HOME TO 75% OF KNOWN CORAL REEF AND 1,400 SPECIES OF FISH, RAJA AMPAT IS ONE OF THE EARTH'S MOST VITAL MARINE BREEDING GROUNDS. FACED WITH OVERFISHING AND SEA LEVEL RISING, LOCALS ARE TAKING STEPS TO PRESERVE THE REEFS UPON WHICH THEY DEPEND. KAPATCOL, WEST PAPUA Come on! Watch your steps. Be careful. How is the sea today? What did you find? Lola shellfish? Sea cucumbers? We didn't go too far, just around here. I found four black sea cucumbers and six lola shellfish. The lobsters are hiding today. The water is a bit murky. So visibility is poor down there. I guess, enough for today. The weather is not very good for us to do monitoring. Let's pray to God the weather will be better on Monday. So it will be a good day to open the sasi area. SASI IS A LOCAL CONSERVATION SCHEME THAT BAN THE HARVEST OF SEA FAUNA IN A FIXED AREA FOR A DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME. THE KAPATCOL VILLAGE IS PREPARING TO OPEN SASI AREA FOR A WEEK, AFTER BEING CLOSED FOR SIX MONTHS. We used to bring home a good amount of catch from the sea. We could still get sea cucumbers. It got less and less nowadays. Maybe we'd gotten less strict. People from outside would come and use poisons and explosives. It destroyed the corals. And the fish eggs, too. Let's turn this into a sasi area. A sasi area is well protected. It means the area is intact. Nobody can take anything from there. The men did a great job with the sasi back then. They got big lola shellfish, good ones. Although we are women, we have equal rights as men. Hopefully, it will bring good things for us ladies. Women must not get left behind. We can do it, too. Good afternoon, ladies. Some information for all of you. We are preparing to open sasi. We should get the divers ready. Some ladies are also diving tomorrow. Listen to me. We'll grill some fish tomorrow. Where will we be eating? On the spot, right? Got it. Grilled fish. IN 2010, THE VILLAGE LAUNCHED THE FIRST EVER ALL WOMAN'S SASI, WITH THE SUPPORT OF CHURCH LEADERS. We will begin our service this morning. All congregation, please stand up. Let's sing Hymn number 34, stanza one and two. Down at the cross where my Savior died Down where for cleansing from sin I cried There to my heart was the blood applied Glory to His Name! - Shalom. - Glory to God. - Glory to God. - Shalom. Please sit down. "There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number, "living things both large and small." Psalm 104:25. As Christians, we believe when a place is a sasi area, then it is protected. We bring the sasi board to Church, the Minister prays for it, we return it to its place. It means we can't take anything from the area. The areas within sasi, including logs, we can't touch anything within the sasi limit. Praise be to God, in the name of Jesus. The women's congregation of GKI Jemaat Elim Kapatcol, they are here today to witness the removal of the sasi board in this area. From now on, allow us to do diving activities in the open area, and may the result we get from the sea be beneficial to support us financially, and let the women in this congregation sell the catches of the sea and manage the money. Lord, please accept our prayers and gratitude. In the name of Jesus, our Lord and Savior, we are praying to the Lord in heaven. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. How are you? Let's rejoice Clap your hands and wink Move to the left, move to the right Round and round, switch dance partners Move your feet to the... Right or left? Move your feet to the... Left first. Go up a high mountain And down the mountain So, what will you do with the catch from the sea? We'll sell them. The ladies have agreed. Whoever needs the money, for school or medicine, we can help. We're here. These look good. Come, let me see. On this first day, we got 702 lola shellfish. We returned 69 of them to the sea because they're too small. We have 633 good ones. We got five red sea cucumber. With the result of the sasi, I hope to be able to help my friends and the ladies here. Thanks to this, we now have some savings. Even if we don't have money. So how about tomorrow? Are we satisfied with today's result? We had thieves in November. They came using tools. It lessens today's result. When it happened, they used an air compressor. We can see the hose floating on the surface. Keep the spirit up! Beautiful as the Garden of Eden In the beginning of time Trees And forests flourish So pretty and happy Come Sweet day, come The day of judgment In my days Of work I pray you come soon ONLY AROUND 7% OF THE EARTH'S OCEANS ARE PROTECTED AREAS. AS SEA TEMPERATURE CONTINUES TO RISE, MORE AND MORE MARINE HABITATS WILL BE THREATENED BY BLEACHING. CONSERVING REEFS GIVE VITAL MARINE LIFE THE BEST CHANCE TO SURVIVE AND REPLENISH. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too, Mr. Mukim. What should I do, Mr. Mukim? My garden is destroyed. Let's take a look together. The Imam will help us find a solution to this problem. So it won't happen again. Before the government responds or instructs anything, let's pray so this misfortune won't happen again. We'll do what we can and pray for the best. - Let's take a look. - Together. That's fine. The elephants have destroyed Mr. Muhammad's garden. There's nothing left of his crops. The elephants' instincts are stronger than other animals. Perhaps it's a test, warning, or punishment from God. Thank you for your time, Mr. Mukim. We'll make the arrangement. We'll be on our way, then. Let's pray. We came here to see directly. Mr. Mukim agrees. We ask for you, Mr. Mukim, to organize a gathering to pray. We'll leave it to you. - Safe trip. - Thank you! - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. Congregation of today's Friday prayer. Humans and animals, elephants, chickens, ducks, are all Allah's creation. Why do we blame the elephants for wandering into villages? We're the ones with control. Animals don't have that. From now on, let's get closer to Allah. May Allah bless and accept all our endeavors. The Koran says human beings are responsible for Nature's destruction, both land and sea. If we take care of our environment, God willing, nature will be one with us. If we are good, so is Nature. If we are bad, so is Nature. As human beings, we have to take care of our environment. Don't do damage to our surroundings. Don't do harm to our land and sea. If we harm Nature, we will pay the price. Floods, avalanches, and disturbances from animals. The elephants, for example, they wander into our villages and eat our crops. Because we took their food from them. We have turned riverbanks into gardens. If we don't disturb the elephants, they won't disturb us. Maybe it's a test for us. God sent the elephants to test us. Maybe we've been neglectful. We've failed to keep the balance between man and Nature. IN A SINGLE GENERATION, THE SUMATRAN ELEPHANT HAS LOST 50% OF ITS POPULATION AND 70% OF ITS NATURAL HABITAT. AS A RESULT, ELEPHANTS ARE WANDERING INTO VILLAGES, FRIGHTENING LOCAL COMMUNITIES, AND TRAMPLING VALUABLE CROPS. SINCE 1990, NEARLY HALF SUMATRA'S FOREST HAS BEEN LOST, MUCH OF IT TO MAKE WAY FOR INDUSTRIAL NEEDS. As human beings, we must persevere in praying. If we stop praying, that's arrogance. Our religion says so. Mr. Mukim must take action so it won't happen again. I think there are only two solutions, poison or shoot it. We can't do that. Here, sir. We ask you to conduct a prayer for our very own Mr. Muhammad and his garden. We ask God to keep the elephants from returning to his garden. For these prayer participants, may God protect us from harm, may the elephants no longer disturb our village. I ask forgiveness to Allah the Almighty The only God, the Living The Self-Sustaining And I repent to You O Allah Please grant us safety Safety on Earth and in the hereafter O Allah, keep us away from harm As only You have the power O Allah, keep us away from pestilence Disease, unjust, quarrels Cruelty and wars, both seen and unseen And protect the Pameu village And villagers from the elephants With all your mercy, the All-Merciful Exalted is your Lord, the Lord of might Above what... We have to respect and make peace with Nature. If we're hostile to people, they'll return the hostility. The same goes for animals. We have to figure out how to be one with Nature again. So that those who live outside of our property are at peace with us. As the village Imam, it's important for me to spread the message to the village people to leave the elephants alone. Don't poison them. Don't make trenches that can harm them. In the name of God Damage has been seen on land and sea Caused by the deeds of humans So God makes them feel Some result of their deeds According to the scripture, humans are responsible for the destruction of the forests and the sea. Yes. The elephants wander here because of us. Yes. We destroyed their habitat, so they don't know where to live, and they wander into our villages. Once they're here, what do they eat? - They eat our crops. - Yes. - If we are good, so is Nature. - Yes. For example, don't go overboard when we're fishing at the river. What do we get? We catch some fishes. But if we poison the fishes, they'll all die. There will be no more left for us. Whose fault? - It's our fault. - Yes. Man and Nature have to work together. Yes. Build a relationship. So Nature will give to us. THE SUMATRAN ELEPHANT IS A KEY SPECIES FOR KEEPING THE BALANCE OF SUMATRA'S FOREST ECOSYSTEM. TO SAVE SUMATRAN ELEPHANTS AND HALT CLIMATE CHANGE, MORE FORESTS MUST BE PROTECTED. Where's Tantra? Tantra? Downstairs. I woke him up. Since I was young, I've been lucky enough to be someone who always searching for meanings of life. SKY EARTH I fell in love with Islam because it's a beautiful faith. It provides answers to life. Love is the foundation that starts my journey in Islam. Love is important. Because if we start something with love, we will be ready to make sacrifices. At this stage, I feel I've gained so much energy by sacrificing my old habits, in order to follow the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad. In my journey, I found guidance in Islam that has been my inspiration. It then inspires the life I am leading now. This becomes the basis of my journey in interpreting Islam. I feel the importance of thayyib, as a relevant reference in this day and age. THAYYIB IS AN ARABIC WORD, WHICH MEANS GOOD AND FAIR. Thayyib is inseparable from the concept of halal. We have to be aware of the origin of everything in our life. The things we use in life. Most importantly, what we eat. We are currently sowing seeds in the garden. No harvest yet. In the meantime, we buy from the market. For the restaurant. Because we need lots of ingredients not available yet in the garden. When the garden provides it, I don't need to buy anymore. Come here, ma'am. This is winged bean. Organic winged bean. This is chayote. Also organic. Wow, petai. It's also organic. Can I have an extra basket? Four dollars? Don't use plastic as the base. Can we use leaves or something? Do you have any leaves? Good. That's better. This is your old basket. I'm reusing it. Let's find some more. Food is the most essential issue we should take seriously. I always say to young people, how can we regain our right to live healthily? How can we reinforce thayyib in this modern age? An age where we are going through crisis in honor, goodness, and things that are thayyib. I'm going downstairs. Okay, ma'am. I'm going to the garden. I often ask, how can we reclaim Islam as a mercy to all creation when we, as Muslims, have stopped being good to our body, by eating food that is bad for us? You can tell something is good when it can be decomposed into something beneficial. It is said in the Koran that Allah does not create a single creation in vain. Everything has a benefit. How does the cassava taste? It's delicious. In that context, we can see that everything good can be decomposed. If it can't be decomposed, it's bad. If something is not decomposed, it's because we are being excessive. If we want to cook, we go to the garden, not the market. The problem in this modern age, all the inventions and explorations by scientists are for the industry. They are for commercial and financial uses This leads to exploitation. In principle, exploitation is the same as injustice. It's fasad or decadence, taking something more than we deserve from Nature or from other people. This is the heart of the problem. When we are being excessive, we will leave waste. That's the nature of it. And Allah does not create waste. Something that is not decomposed into benefits. I think this is a big and complex issue. I find it to be a challenge. And I'm trying to deal with it in life. That's why I chose to live here, in Bumi Langit. Initially, people thought I was strange, leading a non-conventional life, living in a barren, hilly area, trying to connect with soil, water, animals, and plants, and trying to re-establish them, restoring them. Because the most important thing we should realize, Nature is inseparable from our life as human beings. When Father bought this land, I was confused. Why buy such a barren land? Why not buy a good one? But if we buy good land, we would be the one harming it. It's better to repair the damage. Rather than causing damage to the good. It's warm. Yes, it is warm. But it's not perfect yet. To get good compost, it needs more disintegration. Let's continue. THE FAMILY RUNS A PERMACULTURE WORKSHOP, AN AGRICULTURE SYSTEM MODELED AFTER THE NATURAL ECOSYSTEM. THE WORKSHOP EMPHASIZES THE MUTUAL RELATION BETWEEN MAN AND NATURE. The word permaculture itself is Islamic in context. Perma is from permanent. Culture is life. We have to see how something lives in its natural condition. Permaculture is very simple. Care for the Earth and the people and share justly. Permaculture also enables us to have full interactions and fully understand how God's creation lives. We can't live on Earth to constantly look up to the heavens. By practicing permaculture, inevitably, we will change our environment. One of the principles is responding to change in a creative way. We have to respond to the evolving time creatively and continuously, like Nature. The Earth is not going anywhere. Nature is not going anywhere. It will continue to evolve, overcoming climate change or global warming. But if humans want to stay here, we need to change. It's not Nature's problem. Nature will live on until the end of days. One, two, three! I think global warming is just one aspect that is happening now. If we want to face global warming as an external problem, we need to deal with our internal problems. Start with how we treat our own bodies. We are gathering here tonight at the final stage of our workshop. I would like to start with comments or questions. From there, we can have lively discussions. I told a friend that I'm here to learn about permaculture. He is developing an eco-resort. He also wants to empower the community. I said, "Why don't you practice permaculture?" He asked, "What about the economic aspect?" It's a very relevant, frequently asked question. If we want to start goodness, profit cannot be our main objective. We'll get trapped in a system for which profit is a must. Financial profit, I mean. It's a recipe for disaster because we will always compromise. For example, if Indonesia is to produce thayyib things, things that are socially just and environmentally sound, things that are good to Nature and have social justice, the main objective is to create goodness. This goodness has been the noble tradition of all Indonesians. People will gravitate toward goodness. As Muslims, we are all khalifah. Khalifah fil ardh. Leader of this Earth. So our connection to the soil, water, the sun, the wind, the animals, the plants, that's how we measure our role as a khalifah. THE FOOD INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTES TO ONE-THIRD OF THE WORLD'S GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS. IMPLEMENTING A LOCAL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AGRICULTURE SYSTEM LEADS TO LESS EMISSION. URBAN AREA ONLY OCCUPIES 2% OF EARTH LAND SURFACE BUT CONTRIBUTES 70% OF HARMFUL GREENHOUSE GASES. BY BUILDING A CONNECTION BETWEEN URBAN PEOPLE AND NATURE, KEBUN KUMARA WANTS TO INSPIRE CHANGE FOR REDUCING CARBON EMISSION. THE BEHAVIOR OF ITS CITIZENS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE CITY'S QUALITY OF LIFE. Welcome to Kebun Kumara. We are located at Pulau Situ Gintung number 3. Here, in Kebun Kumara, we turn some part of the land into a garden. I believe Nature has provided everything for us. I want to join this training so I can be more aware. As a mother with a child, I need a hobby. To avoid stress. That's true. Work routine and traffic in Jakarta I simply want to refresh myself. In my limited knowledge, we can grow something just by planting it in the ground. But there are techniques. I want to know and learn. In Kebun Kumara, we are working on an organic vegetable area. It's our latest project. The area used to be an illegal waste disposal space. It's not ideal, but we have to live with it. In a city, every centimeter of land counts. Just imagine, this small plot of land can give us 1.5 kg of lettuce. My husband, Dhira, has worked in Situ Gintung area since 2011. So he is familiar with the landowner, with the community, so we started to discuss it with the landowner. We are on the same page. The landowner also has a dream for this area to stay green and to be an educational space. Today we plan to harvest the 30-day-old vegetables we planted. Before this, I have worked for NGOs, foundations, schools, and big corporations. And then I wondered, "Is this what I want to do?" Many things I experienced there are not what I wanted in life. This is so good. Look at the color. I got married in 2015. We had this mission. As a couple, we wanted to do something meaningful for our lives. Together. Let's get back to work. Harvest time! We're harvesting cucumbers. Look at our cucumbers! So we were looking for something that suits our skills, something we're passionate about. For me, it's education. My husband and I love nature. What if we make a learning space, a learning garden? So maybe we can answer the problem by providing a space. Why are we not washing them? They'll rot much faster if washed. - Okay. - It's already clean. Very clean. I feel like eating it right now. IS THERE ANY MINIMUM ORDER? NO, THERE ISN'T. HOW MANY DO YOU WANT? If many city people are disconnected from nature, the solution should be in the city itself. We got invited to give training at a festival. We received positive response. Parents feel their kids spend too much time with gadgets. They lost touch with Nature. They know nothing about earth or their food. So people are very happy with the training. We are also happy that there are parents who care. They want their kids to get in touch with Nature. Kids don't have to feel icky. It's not dirty, it's just dirt. We are facing global warming, pollution, and extreme weather. Green areas in the middle of the city will be a big help. But I think it should also come with a system to inspire their lifestyle. People can get involved and know what their role is in slowing down climate change. Nature is the most concrete proof of God's glory In any holy scripture, in any religion, the idea of heaven is described with elements of Nature. Personally, when I'm in Nature, seeing flowers bloom, seeing what I planted grow, I can see God's glory. The concrete form of His love, right in front of our eyes. So when we're with Nature, learning about the process, it teaches us about patience, surrender, grace, and sensitivity. And just because we live in a city, we don't have to be disconnected.
