Slow, electric blues guitar & harmonica] [music title: Traveling crawford] [traditional blues riff in the keys of E and A] [music quites a bit as narration begins] (Male Narrator) Southern Illinois, old earth, old forests, old testament. This ground holds tales of many ancient civilizations, historic events, and fantastic folklore. The portion of the state that identifies itself as “Little Egypt” is surrounded by the Mississippi, Ohio, and Wabash Rivers. The rivers not only define its boundaries but have shaped the histories and lives of all who have lived there. These waters encapsulate a land hundreds of miles, attitudes and lifestyle away from the cosmopolitan cities to the north. This countryside has challenged all those who have staked their claim here leaving behind a place filled with fading stories, histories, and lessons from the past. [blues music continues in background] This is the story of Elizabeth Reed who in 1845 became the first woman to be hanged in Illinois. She was accused of poisoning her husband Leonard with arsenic laced tea then tried and convicted by a jury of 12 men. Betsy was hanged on May 23rd which to most would be where the story ends. However, Elizabeth Reed's story had just begun. The circumstances of her arrest, trial, conviction, execution, burial, and afterlife have been debated ever since. The folklore that exists today suggests her restless spirit wanders the countryside. Does her ghost haunt the site of her execution because she was falsely accused or due to the very nature of her crime? Some may argue it was because her voice was never heard. While these ghostly debates may never end what is known is that this “murderous witch's” story fascinates to this day. To fully appreciate the tale of Elizabeth “Betsey” Reed one must understand the history and culture of Southern Illinois. [Chris Sutton] Well terrain wise Southern Illinois is…okay you've got the rivers. Okay? [blue music ends and fades] So the terrain is Southern Illinois is such that… [upbeat acoustic guitar strumming] they slope down towards the rivers. So you've got these hilly areas you know around the rivers. Cause there is a lot of towns around the rivers. These river towns have a lot of barge traffic. That's where a lot of these towns in Illinois start. [pleasant synthesizer notes] But then you get towards the middle of it and it's flat. It's prairie land so to speak. So you've got rolling hills as you go around the rivers as it goes down and you've got flat terrain in Southern Illinois. Normally after that there's a lot of forest and things like that around. But there's lots of agriculture and corn and all that kind of stuff. [Rob Byrley] Well, we have a lot of farming. It's a really agricultural area. And then right out our backdoor we have the Wabash River. So a lot of recreation there and commercial fishing. To the south we have the timber. It's just a unique place; A lot of agriculture, a lot of industry related to the agriculture. [music title: A peaceful life] [Narrator] Early settlers in Illinois didn't view most of the land as fertile, advising to build and farm where trees grow. In fact, for Leonard Reed the farm ground had proven to be a challenge greater than the meager farming skills either he or Elizabeth possessed. It wasn't until John Deere's invention of the metal plow in 1837 that farmers could till Southern Illinois ground. Little Egypt's soil was much richer than the eastern United States and therefore more difficult to cultivate. Up until the metal plow open plains were used for a variety of livestock, especially cattle and hogs. Settlers foraged for much needed sustenance and their options were limited to what an area provided. (John Winterbauer) I think it's a cultural thing because Illinois was settled from the south. Those people came out of the upper-southern region of the United States into an area already seeped with the Mississippian culture and the French culture. And all that combined into a unique blend of people that have contributed, or it's contributed to the feel of the place. It just hangs there. There's a different feeling in Southern Illinois then there is say in Chicago, which is bustling and crazy and violent. That's not really like that down there. They are… [music fades out] They keep to themselves from time to time. But for the most part they are a friendly group of salt of the earth people. (Narrator) Before Illinois became a state [birds chirping] it was known as the Indiana territory. This new frontier presented many obstacles to anyone attempting to carve out a life there. Indigenous tribes grew increasingly alarmed by the growing number of settlers that continued to populate their lands. In addition to the native tribes, early settlers were met by a variety of forest creatures who also laid claim to the territory. [deep, rising tones and echoes] Yes the land proved to be bountiful but it also brought forth hardships that not everyone was prepared to handle. And this was virgin timber. (Rick Kelsheimer) It was hardwoods. [birds chirping] It hadn't become Southern Illinois's fields today. But back then it was hardwood forest. There would be prairies in-between that would look like oceans of grass but where Betsy lived it was old-growth hardwood forest. At the time there were bears, there were wolves, there were panthers, which are mountain lions, other than every other critter out there. [Native American flute note echoes] (Narrator) When the populations of the settlers and Indians initially merged relations were peaceful and friendly. This proved to be short lived as the natives grew to be uncomfortable with the foreign incursion which increasingly used up the areas resources. Shawnee Chief Tecumseh came to the area in the early 1800's to recruit the Illini tribes in his efforts against the white settlers. [birds chirp in background] The growing conflicts with the Indian tribes continued through the founding of Illinois in 1818 before culminating in the Blackhawk War of 1832. The brutalities of their conflicts left scars throughout the region. (Chris Sutton) The Natives were not, obviously [birds chirping] and I don't blame them, were not too keen about the white settlers moving in and taking their land. And so yes there were massacres. There was fighting. Of course, we know who won the war. But there were times where the Natives fought back just like you and I would do if someone was trying to take our land. [music swells into new song] [acoustic guitar strums as electric guitar notes play] [music title: Little egypt] So traveling down to Crawford County, (John Winterbauer) I hadn't been there before I didn't get to spend as much time as I had wanted to. I met up with Jason and his team in Palestine [harmonica plays] And explored just a little bit around before we went out to the cemetery to visit Elizabeth. And I got to tell you, like most of Southern Illinois, it's a quaint, friendly, welcoming place, which most of Southern Illinois is. It's a cultural thing. I think they're nicer (chuckles) In Southern Illinois than a lot of places in the state. And that's what I found in Palestine and down around Crawford County. I spent a lot of time on the dirt roads out there. Didn't see a lot of people but those that I did see were very pleasant people, glad to see people, happy to help with what we were doing. I really enjoyed it. [guitar and harmonica continue] (Jason Snider) We're the Crawford County Ghost Hunters Society and we investigate claims of paranormal activity and phenomena all over the state of Illinois and parts of Indiana. We investigate anywhere people call us into. We've investigated businesses, houses, any other place people call us into that they think they have any type of paranormal activity or occurrence taking place at their location. Crawford County is considered to be one of the most haunted counties in Illinois, I would say, because we have one of the oldest white settlements in the state, which is Palestine, Illinois. And there's a lot of activity and historical sites in Palestine. They've found city upon city of ancient civilizations where they've dug into them. There's archeological dig sites in Palestine. Crawford County back in the day actually stretched its border up into Canada. Crawford County is one of the oldest counties in Illinois if not the oldest. [music fades] Crawford County has a lot of historical locations. We had a Hutson massacre that took place here in Hutsonville, Illinois. [music begins. Synthesizer vocals. Ominous] [periodic tapping noises heard echoing] [music title: Hutson massacre] [notes hold and a deep, Australian didgeridoo note plays] [huanting notes play] The location we are currently at is the site of the Hutson Massacre that took place in 1813. And what happened here… It was a horrible event that took place behind us here at this location The cabins that are currently here now are reconstructed cabins. These aren't the original cabins from the massacre. But in 1812 Isaac Hutson came to this area from Turman Township in Sullivan County, Indiana. He moved to this area because he liked the prairie. He just thought it was a neat area. He enjoyed this area. He built a little cabin here with his family. He had a wife and I believe it was six kids and he went to… He went to Hutsonville…well the this whole town here was named after this event you know Hutsonville you know Isaac Hutson that's how Hutsonville got its name. But he went to Palestine one night to the mill so when he went to the mill he came back home it was real late at night when he got back here. He saw a glow off in the distance. When he got closer he kinda feared the worse, you know, knowing something bad had happened. When he got up here he realized his family had been massacred by Indians. When he got up there, there was a guy by the name of Dixon, which was his neighbor. He lived close to Hutson here too. When he got up here, Dixon was laying on the ground with his chest tore open and his heart was on a post. They were pretty brutally massacred. His baby, they took it… She was…like when they raided the cabins, the Indians came into the cabins, Mrs. Hutson was holding the baby in her arms. They took the baby and put it in a boiling kettle of soup and killed the baby like that and then killed the rest of the family. They chopped their heads off and put them on a post out here… Was what some of the historical accounts say. They scattered their heads and put them on posts out here by the cabin. So it was a pretty brutal murder that took place here. After that, Hutson swore revenge. He moved to the, well what is now current day Terre Haute. Fort Harrison was located there. He joined the Army there at Fort Harrison which was kind of his downfall because he was later killed by Indians, himself, in a fight about a half a mile south of the fort where Terre Haute now stands. [Music fades out] We're currently about seven mile north of Palestine. So this massacre ties into the early settlers in the Palestine area. And then Heathsville and Baker's Cemetery where Elizabeth Betsey Reed was buried is a little south of Palestine. There was a lot of stuff and a lot of historical evidence in this area showing the hard time a lot of these settlers went through back in the day. The pioneers in the early area… So you know it was a just a lot of bad happenings. (Narrator) Throughout history, it has often been the tragedies of life that have lead to the tales that are passed down from generation to generation. [deep, droning music] In the world of the paranormal, these tales often grow dark. Hauntings are a lot of times (Robbin Terry) Caused by traumatic experiences or deaths [eerie synth tones] that might have occurred. It could be just from a hanging. It could be from violent car crashes, murders, [haunting notes] just about any type of traumatic experiences someone might encounter could cause a haunting. They could also be from people who are basically staying back and staying in a location where they want to stay just because they are not sure where to go and how to get there. And so they stay behind. [scraping noises in music] We see different hauntings that are residual and intelligent type haunting. Where residual is kind of like a tape replayer ...tape recorder that just keeps repeating itself, running over in time over and over and over. Where intelligent hauntings are someone that's [odd noises in music] stayed behind, left in the building, or a location, or just in the grounds. It doesn't even have to be inside a building. It could be where someone… they know they're there and they want to communicate to other people and [music tension rises] you can ask them questions. You can get intelligent, which is why we call them intelligent hauntings, you can get actual answers back from them that describe why they're there, maybe who they are and what they're doing there. [music continues w/ haunting undertones[ (Narrator) Crawford County is among the oldest territories in Illinois and contains possibly more cemeteries than any other county. Old plots and family cemeteries are scattered along Highway 33, many within mere minutes from one another. [dissonant musical notes] And the more graves there are, the more folklore there is attached to them. [eerie music continues] So down here (Jason Dickerson) Or south Palestine there's been a few stories. They're kind of I don't know if they're urban legends so much but I know a lot of kids used to come down here to scare themselves little bit. There's a church up here called Pleasant View and it's got a bell and there's three crosses out here. And supposedly three witches were killed here, buried here, or something. And so if you ring the bell at midnight [sudden, jarring tone] It's supposed to ring and if it rings one less than how many people are in your party [grating noises in music] One of you is supposed to die is supposed to be the story. [synthesized, haunting vocals] So A few years ago I come down here with my kids and we rang the bell at midnight like you're supposed to and it tolled three times and as soon as it stopped, which was weird, [dissonant notes] Three birds flew out of the bell after it rang. Well (chuckles) it freaked everybody out. We took off for the vehicles and drove away. [dissonant undertones] (Narrator) Yet another legend involves the Bartmess Cemetery that was once located at the top of this hill. Cleared to create more farmland, the Bartmess family headstones were moved over to nearby Greenhill Cemetery while their remains were left behind. [droning music continues[ The custom of farming over old graveyards was a common measure in the Illinois early years. The value of Illinois farmland sometimes supersedes even burial customs. [higher pitched dissonance] There are countless reasons why family plots are altered, moved, and sometimes forgotten. [rising ethereal music begins] Paranormal traditions cite the separation of bodies from their gravestone marker as a possible contributing factor to ghost haunts. [music sounds more angelic] [soft tones, synthesized notes] [music swells then fades] [deep, throaty, synthesized music with slow eerie keyboard] [music title: Heathsville] (Narrator) The Reed's lived and sharecropped on farmland in Heathsville Illinois. This nondescript parcel of land lies off an ordinary curve next to highway 33. The doomed pair never made a decent living, leaving Elizabeth in debt when her husband Leonard passed away. [odd tapping and inaudible female voice] One of the things about Southern Illinois (Winterbauer) Is the multitude of names that have ominous overtones. [creepy, breathy noise] In the Crawford County area there's Purgatory Swamp, which of course purgatory implies you're wandering in the afterlife, The Devil's Neck along the river, Devil's Backbone is the name of the ridge. Where those names come from I'm not exactly sure but they all imply this ominous vibe. And the area actually gives that off in strange ways. Not that I'm a psychic or have that ability but the the air it just picks up on those names and it permeates everything around it. That interests me a lot about Southern Illinois. And that feeling's still there even when you're not looking for it. Well Heathsville is the closest town (Teri Nash) And nowadays it's about six houses. But it was a little bigger than that in the early 1800s. And the center of the community was the Heath Inn. [eerie voice] Which, was besides being inn it was a stagecoach stop. And the mail went there so everyone gathered there. And it would have been about a half a mile from the Reed cabin. And the lady that worked for our family name was Orma Baker and her family, on her mother's side of the family, were the Heaths. And so they knew the Reeds. And, um Then Leonard Reed is buried in the Baker Cemetery, which sits behind our property. [music continues. High-pitched swells and clicking] (Snider) The Betsey Reed story as we know it goes like this: Elizabeth Betsey Reed was convicted and found guilty of poisoning her husband with arsenic-laid sassafras tea. On April 261845 she was actually convicted or they started the trial and then on April 28th of 1845 that's when she was convicted and found guilty. (Narrator) Elizabeth Reed's story seemed destined to exist between generational gossip and cemetery tales until attracting the attention of The Lawrence County Historical society. Through countless hours of research led by society treasurer John King the society compiled the official record including newspaper accounts from as far away as London England. The local arts council staged the play “Hanging, The Saga of Betsey Reed” which Dann Norton wrote based on the historical societies' meritorious research. [ominous music fades away] There was nothing in the records (Dann Norton) That explained how they knew for sure this was arsenic. The only reason (John King) To suspect arsenic poisoning was that Evaline Deal said that she found this particular piece of paper between two plates in the cupboard and and then Mrs. Reed threw it outdoors. She retrieved it and in that traced back to Dr. Logan at his pharmacy in Russellville saying, "it had to be me." That had to be bought at my store. I don't remember selling it to anybody but only I would have packaged it in this way "in this sort of paper." (Dickerson) So some of the [birds heard in background] accusations the reason why they accused her of it was there was a I assume a salesman in a general store that swears he sold her the arsenic. And the only witness that actually saw her put the powder in his tea was I believe a niece or a younger daughter. That was who testified and that testimony was enough. You know, she was a woman. Back then they really didn't have rights. That was good enough. [birds stop[ I got involved with the "Hanging (Nash) Of Betsey Reed" book by Rick Kelsheimer when a mutual friend introduced us when he was writing the book and she knew that I had grown up on the farm where Leonard and Betsey Reed had lived in the 1840s. And that an elderly woman who worked for my family had a close connection to the case and had taught me about the case since I was young. Then I started working with Rick on researching the book. (Kelsheimer) Leonard her husband had gotten sick over a period of time. And then what Evaline Deal said is that she saw Betsey puts a white powder in his squirrel stew [dark music begins] And then [weird chattering] of course at the end supposedly he put it in her… She put it in his sassafras tea. But, and there's another neighbor who [music title: The gift of poison] The Reeds owed money to who came over and said he'd seen her feed him squirrel stew and he'd get deathly sick, and they thought he was going to die then but he didn't say anything 'cause he didn't want to get involved. But he said it after they hung her. She was arrested (Nash) After the neighbor girl who would have been Evaline Deal had went to the neighbors and reported she saw Betsey put white powder in his tea. And supposedly it was sassafras tea because tea was very expensive then. Among the claims against the Reed estate (Narrator) Following Betsey's trial were that from Doctors Boyle, Wynn, and Logan, who had separately been treating Leonard for a persistent stomach aliment over a three-year period. The claims were for unpaid medical bills including doctor visits and antimony treatments, which were used to purge inflamed bowels. The treatments should beckon the question as to the whether the white powder seen by Evaline Deal was prescribed by one of Leonard's physicians. [bubbling sounds heard in music] Our county at Charlottesville, which is west of Birds between Birds and Chauncey where the Birds - Chauncey blacktop crosses the Embarras River, was a mill operated by the Shakers. This was the westernmost Shaker community in the nation. [music continues] The Heaths… They gave up on the mill after it had been washed out and they had rebuilt it and the Heaths purchased it. And it's this same family that has the namesake of Heathsville in southeastern Crawford County. And family members have gone on to form the Heath Candy Company of Robinson who is now owned by the Hershey Candy Company of Hershey, Pennsylvania. Then the Harrimans who she reported (Nash) Seeing the poison to Mrs. Harriman's father was the constable which was Duane Gaines… And if you could see this area it's all within about a two mile radius… And so they got her father who was the constable and they told him that they thought Leonard had been poisoned and the doctors came [creepy sounds in ambience] When he had died because he became very ill suddenly. But um he had been having chronic stomach illness [music continues. Airy and dark] So they suspected that he was being slowly poisoned. And then Betsey got a little excited or in a hurry and gave him a bigger dose that day that killed him. And I think that's what his autopsy led them to believe. She told me that her grandfather… Might have been great grandfather I can't remember at the time right now… what she said but he was a ten-year-old boy about the time of the murders and he knew them, that they would come down to do their trading at the store that was down there and stop in and get their mail. And that Betsey was very odd. She wasn't liked. That she wore a white bonnet… She never mentioned a veil which has been mentioned in some of our research… And Rick Kelsheimer's book says it was a veil. It's a historical novel but in our research that's why he said a veil. But I was told a white bonnet. And when she would go outdoors she would put a black bonnet on top of that and that was odd is what the neighbors said. (Kelsheimer) But even the eyewitness reports that I found contradicted each other. Some people said she was horribly ugly disfigured and then there are eyewitness reports from the hanging that said she was beautiful, even angelic-like. So everything was contradicted. But from reading and all there a couple things became perfectly clear; Women hated Betsey Reed, [ambience continues] The men, not so much. I mean so maybe she was kind of a gal the men liked maybe she's easy to look at or maybe she… But the women really did. There was a lot of hatred for her. (Nash) It kind of creeps you out to go over where the house was. Just… I don't know because I guess you know the murder occurred there. There's a creepy feeling there. I'll say that. [ambience ends but new music swells in] [music title: Palestine] [periodic, rhythmic drums sound] (Terry) the historical part of the hauntings is probably some of my favorite part. Because history is what is really kind of cool with these older locations and the older buildings that are out there and even the older grounds like the Gettysburg. Places like that. That's the most fascinating part of it. And it's kind of like why are why are they still there? What keeps those spirits and that energy at those locations? And I've always tell people before is like the only thing we know about the paranormal is we don't really know anything about the paranormal until we've crossed over to see it ourselves. But we can still talk to some of these intelligent spirits at these locations and probably get bits and pieces and put it together and try to figure out a little bit more all the time of what's happening at different locations and different grounds. [high pitched, frequency noise in music] Southern Illinois since it's older (Sutton) Than our friends up north. It's older. It's got more ghosts. Because there's been more people living here. It's been around longer. And some of these river towns… I have not come across a river town yet that is not haunted in some way. Whether you go up to Hannibal which is up in Missouri all the way around the Wabash up and around that area, there's always some type of haunt going on. It's because they've been here for so long. And back then you know when the state started there was a lot of frontier type of justice still going on. Things like that. It was settled pretty early and so lots of weird things happened in Southern Illinois as far as around violence and things like that. (Narrator) Downtown Palestine has all the comforts one comes to expect from a Southern Illinois community. This historic downtown area is loaded with charm but visitors are most likely never aware of the circumstances that befell this small town in 1845. [Palestine music continues. High frequency ambience] As far as the main (Byrley) Towns in Crawford County we have Robinson which is the county seat. Originally the county seat was in Palestine from I believe 1821 to 1847. In 1847 it moved to Robinson and that's our... our biggest town. And you have Oblong to the west, Palestine here to the east, Flat Rock to the south, and you have a Hustonville to the north. And there's been different little towns that popped up and faded away. One was Vernon right south of town here. It got started in about 1830 and by 1883 it was gone. There's Bolivar a little settlement north of town here. It's long gone. (Narrator) The early pioneers had entrenched themselves in Fort Lamotte and a recreation can be found along the edge of town. The standard French fort is a stark reminder of the hazards the encroaching settlers faced. Yes that was the beginning. And actually when the people started arriving here [ambient music fades] It wasn't called Palestine. The first name that I've come across was a Lamotte settlement, the settlement of Fort Lamotte. And then later when the town was laid out. And actually the first name of this town wasn't Palestine. The first name was Mount Pleasant [music ambience begins] And for some reason Cullom and Kitchell you know donated the ground for Palestine… [dark, airy ambience] For some reason they must have or someone must have told them you know the lore of Jean Lamotte … The land of milk and honey… And they changed it to Palestine. [music title: Calling Forth Flame] [dissonant clanking] And then they brought her to Palestine which was at the time the county seat. She was held in the jail at Palestine and this is where the whole witch story comes in with Betsey Reed. But some people claim she was a witch because while she was being held at the Palestine jail she actually burnt the jail down with no source of ignition, no matches. You know no way of actually burning the jail down and she somehow managed to set fire to that jail. So that's still a mystery in a legend [sounds of fire] to this day how Betsey actually burnt the jail down. But anyway when he had died, he had obviously been poisoned and she was arrested. Because you remember at that time Palestine was a county seat. There's a land office up here on the square. Where the high school now is now was the town square land office on the south end. The jail was on the north end. She was arrested and brought to jail. And this jail was a formidable structure. I mean it was recessed into the ground a couple feet. It had 12 by 12 timbers 12 inch by 12 inch on the inside and outside but and then 12 inch gap between them that vertical boards were just stuck in. There wasn't a door entering the jail. You had... at first you had to go up a ladder to the second story. A two foot by two foot trap door would be lifted up and you would go down into it. And later on they actually put a stairway up to the second story. And there's two windows. I don't recall the size but they had one inch iron bars I believe about three inches apart. So it was pretty well escape proof. Somehow she had got hold of matches or a lighting device anyway. You got to figure if that jail went up in around 1821 or 1820 by 1844 the timbers would have been pretty well dried out. So it may have got started fairly easy. [dark ambient music continues] Betsy was held in the Palestine jail and somehow they never knew how she did it but she managed to burn the wall of the jail a little bit at a time. Until one night the fire got away from her. And when the fire got away from her she burned the jail down. And she was running down Main Street in Palestine because the jail sit where what is now the high school sits in Palestine. And there was a hotel where the Fife Opera House sits and a gentleman was sitting outside and his last name was Gerard. And he saw her running down the street and I think her clothes were smoking. And he tackled her and saved her. And I know one thing that Orma Baker told me was that helped lead to the rumors that she was a witch because they didn't know how she started that fire. [music is very quiet] (Narrator) One interesting story that we were told is that of the belief that a secret, select few practiced the craft of creating fire from thin air and that Elizabeth Reed was gifted with this ability. It is a hypothetical explanation as to how she was able to set her formidable confines ablaze with no known source to do so. Whether or not one believes in this is not important. But it certainly adds to the belief in witchcraft that the people of the time accused Betsy of. It is interesting to note that the jail fire was Betsey's only documented attempt at any type of defense or desire to escape her fate. Unfortunately for Mrs. Reed, the failed plot was further proof of her guilt in the eyes of the community. One thing is for certain: The townsfolk were relieved when she was finally removed from Palestine. [music swells to a crescendo and fades] Lawrence County, Illinois is a small county in rural Southeastern Illinois. We have a population of about 15000 people. We have... we are about back to our population of the 1880s. We are a county that suffers economically. The oil industry is on a… It's been the lifeblood of this county along with farming and both industries have taken it on the chin here in recent years. We used to have a massive Texaco refinery in our county and employed good jobs for a lot of people. That is gone. The Marathon Ohio Oil Company and the Marathon Oil Company are gone. There's very little industry. There's a huge unemployment of numbers. It's a low-income county, one of the poorest in the state. But yet it's a fine place to live. We have all the amenities that one needs. We are close to metropolitan areas. It's as good a county as any in our nation to to reside in. [music swells in. Dark, rhythmic synth.] And the jail was pretty much destroyed so they had to move Betsey to Lawrenceville. And when they moved her to Lawrenceville that's where she was tried. [music title: Lawrenceville] [pulsating notes] Betsey Reed's two lawyers defense lawyers, she had two. One was Augustus French, who I mentioned a year and a half after trial became the ninth governor of the State of Illinois. But the second lawyer and the one who actually was the lead lawyer in the case name was Usher Linder. Usher Linder was a famous attorney in Illinois. He had been Attorney General of the state. He had been involved in Alton, Illinois with the with the case of Elijah Lovejoy when he was executed and his press destroyed, which is the whole basis of freedom of the press in this nation, based upon this Lovejoy case. In Alton, Illinois there was an abolitionist named Elijah P. Lovejoy and he didn't believe in slavery. So he printed, he was the newspaper printer. He was the editor. He owned the paper. He kept printing you know kept writing his paper… Not... that we should not have slavery. And first they threw his printing press in the river. And so after that he got another one. Well then they burned it and they killed him. And so they say that his ghost haunts part of Alton, Illinois. Now Usher Linder was born where Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, in the same town. They grew up together and they both came to Illinois. Illinois was really if you wanted… The political stars were coming out there: Stephen Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, all that. Well, Usher Linder was a real good friend of Lincoln's. But he was also kind of a rebel rouser. At age 27 became the youngest Attorney General for the State of Illinois. They were having a big convention down there with Lovejoy and he's writing his anti-slavery paper, and he's a speaker. Well, Usher Linder got everybody riled up there and they actually got the mob together. And then, and this is while he's Attorney General, and basically did a speech to get them, the mob to go… They burned down the newspaper, Lovejoy's newspaper at the time, pulled him out and lynched him. One thing that interests me is about this story is Usher Linder who in 1837 was a pro-slavery advocate who battled with Elijah Lovejoy whose death in November of 1837 in Alton not only lit the fuse that sparked the civil war but left a haunting behind where Elijah Lovejoy died. There's a vacant lot there now and his ghost is said to wander there. [music ends] Later on Linder was Betsey Reed's attorney and then her ghost wanders the cemetery. So there's this weird connection between Linder and these two historic vents in Illinois' history that I just find kind of interesting. From what I read, hangings were kind of a big event back then and people would [birds in background] actually come in and set up like a festival. Like, they would sell and trade and barter. And the people got mad because when they moved her everyone was supposedly set up had shops set up to to sell things. And when they moved to Lawrenceville, which is 20 some miles from here, that's a long trip by a horse-drawn cart or something like that. So everyone had to move down there for the hanging. And supposedly when they got there I think the estimate was 20 thousand people, I don't know if that's accurate or not, but a rather large crowd. When I started writing the play I had just kind of assumed that Betsey Reed was probably guilty. She was probably from a hard life and things just happened. But Donna Burton from the society had pointed out this antimony. So for me the big surprise was that he…the man is taking antimony and she said, "You look up antimony." So I looked this up and of course you find out that antimony poisoning mimics arsenic poisoning. So very much so his symptoms could have been caused by this antimony. The next big surprise for me was that he was sick for three years but then all of a sudden in 1844 they think it's arsenic poisoning. Nobody thought this for the two and a half years prior to his death? One of the aspects I appreciate about this story is the fact that she left no record of a defense. Her attorneys apparently didn't put her on the stand. There are no public statements with her defending herself. She could have very easily said, “my husband had been ill with stomach problems for three or four years” which gives credence to the idea that she didn't kill him. Ghosts hang around places for a lot of different reasons. In her case, even though I believe she was guilty and committed the crime, maybe she didn't and her ghost still wanders the cemetery because she's accused of a crime she didn't commit in the 1840s I don't think they would have questioned the guilt of a woman. I mean she was a woman everybody could see it was a possibility and they just moved on with their lives. Well and remember she had burned had had the jail at Palestine on fire whether to commit suicide or it's just an accidental… It caught on fire. So they were considering her a witch and a bad lady [deep, ominous music] [music title: May 23, 1845] [loud clang] [loud clang] [creepy hissing and stretching sounds] [inaudible whispers and breathing noises] We are in Lawrence County Illinois at the location where Elizabeth Betsey Reed was taken to be hung. Behind me here is the old football field and this is the location where they brought her. The judge said to take her to a place within one mile of the courthouse to a convenient place, which ended up being the location where this football field is now located at. So the crazy thing about all this and still a mystery is there's no historical marker at this location whatsoever indicating that she was hung out here. So if you just come out here and look it's just an abandoned football field that's grown up now and it's creepy. [music continues. Breathy noises over dark ambience] [grating noises of tension] [sounds like distant wind] [creepy deep breath] So uh it's still a big mystery as to the exact location of where the scaffold and the she was actually placed to be hung. It says that there was people that watched this event from a hill and that she was down at the bottom of the hill. So the location over here definitely fits the description and all the scholars definitely say this is the location where it was at. We just don't have an exact you know spot with a marker saying you know this is where Elizabeth Betsey Reed was hung. So that's just weird. I think a lot of people today are more fascinated with the afterlife and the spirits and ghost stories than they ever have in the past just because basically the tvs. The tv has put a lot of people out there and they've talked about it, they've seen it on tv and they consider... it's more of a way of life now than it used to be. It was kind of the old thing was like oh no. You don't talk about the spirits. You don't talk about that type of thing. In comparison to what it is today it's more accepted. And I think people enjoy going out and they want to find more about the paranormal and see what's out there and see what the see what's happening. Because they've all had experiences and they've never wanted to talk about those experiences until now. They feel more comfortable that they can share those and everybody's had an experience at one time or another probably. They just either don't know it or didn't want to talk about it. [ambient music still playing but very low key] Historical records actually show that the county just doubled in size you know during her hanging like Dickerson said. You know people came in from all over the place to watch that. And backing the story up just a little bit but before she was actually hung as she was being brought out to her execution site she was actually put on her own coffin. She was in a white dress and she was on her own coffin and she got religion you know. She became very religious when she found out (chuckles) she was going to get executed. There was a guy that actually baptized her in the river near where the new bridge is located at now in Lawrenceville. So she got baptized you know found religion. She was actually singing gospel songs as she was going to her own grave. Singing they said she was singing all kinds of songs on the way there. So that's kind of a weird and eerie side. I'm sure too, seeing somebody sing as they go to their grave. There's a lot of, a lot of reports you know with the haunting too. You know people seeing that that's what they see. They see the residual activity and the residual occurrence of that event taking place so. John Seed was a Baptist preacher who did a sermon who was her minister at the time. He Once he gets her Betsey rides down the hill to the side of the hanging riding on her coffin on this robe. And she's singing hymns on the way down there. And this John Seed he's he's from Scotland and he's a firebrand, hell and brimstone preacher. He sees whatever this crowd is 20,000 people and he said he's going to deliver a sermon. So he preaches for over an hour and it's a hot sun. Betsey Reed is sitting on her coffin yelling, “hallelujah and amen” all the way through the sermon. And then she gets up, Sheriff Samuel Thorn puts a bag over her head, a white or excuse me a black bag, and then pulls the or… chops the rope. She hangs and about a half… they let her hang for about a half hour and then they put her down into that shallow open grave there underneath the gallows. (Male Narrator, southern accent) Psalms 23: The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea though I walk through the valley of shadow of death I will fear no evil for Thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. [different dark, ambient music begins] (Dickerson) There's a hill that the high school sits on now and I guess a lot of people were sitting on it watching. But some people decided to climb up in a tree and sit on a branch. Well after they you know they announced the conviction this that the other, right as they were getting ready to throw the lever to hang her, the tree branch those people were sitting on broke. Well when they fell they all screamed and it stated that the majority of the crowd heard the screams and turned to look to see what the commotion was about and missed the actual hanging. [music title: From the rope to the ground] Now I don't believe there was any actual organized protest at the hanging. But I wanted this character to show up and explain to the audience watching the play that this was something that was controversial. Especially that it was a woman who was to be hanged. Although I think the majority of people in this area probably were a pro death penalty and they were excited about this execution. It was going to be something entertaining to watch. And we have an eyewitness account of Alexander McCarter who as a young boy came with his grandfather, Hamilton, to Lawrenceville to watch this. Young McCarter was on his grandfather's shoulders [female vocalization in ambience] And at the time when Elizabeth Reed dropped from the gallows. Somebody in a nearby tree the limb snapped and the boy's attention was given to the to that and he missed the actual instant of death. The common thought has always been at the at the football field of the old Lawrenceville High School. All accounts that I can gather suggest that it was about a quarter mile to the east. Walnut Street is in front of the high School. That extended with I believe Fifth or Sixth street. Would suggest where the Mills Terrace apartments is, which would have been as good of a site as could be, b ut the same story. [old time projector sounds] Some of our night investigations that we've conducted out here we've actually recorded strange cold spots in the area that seemed to move. And they moved through the football field area behind me here. We've heard what sounded like a scream at one point. But we can't confirm that it wasn't locals. You know we are in an urban area. We try to debunk everything. But we have heard mysterious sounds that just they don't sound right you know. They don't sound like your typical noises you should be hearing out here. We've captured [female vocalization in ambience] a couple evps, electronic voice phenomena, out here. But not as much as what we have at Baker Cemetery, which is where you know we've got a really good evp that we captured. And we're going to be playing that I think. But the the evp is extremely good we captured at the cemetery. But out here it's mostly sounds just things you see out of the corner of your eye. But you're not sure it's there. We haven't got a whole lot of scientific evidence of stuff going on in the area but we have physically seen and heard more things than what we've captured on our equipment. It's definitely a location that I believe is haunted you know [faint music fades out] especially some type of residual activity definitely I believe exists here due to the hanging that took place on May 23rd, 1845. [high-pitched note swells in and fades] [soft, ominous music begins. New song] You know there's a lot of times people will talk at different spirits in a location in a different building and they always think they're talking to Charlie or John or whoever they think the spirit's talking about. But I always look back and say, “you know how do you know you're talking to that person?” Because if I was a spirit at a location you just want to talk to Susie and I said yeah my name's Susie on a by tripping an emf detector, something like that, you really wouldn't know that was Susie or not. You wouldn't know who it is. It's hard to tell. The only way I think that you can actually really talk to spirits in a location is ask them questions that they may be the only one that knows the answer to that question. [base heavy synth note with wind instrument] (Narrator) The next mystery of the case involves the handing of Mrs. Reed's body following the hanging. A confusing account states that she was laid into a shallow grave next to the gallows. But newspaper articles of the time confirm documents that reference results from her autopsy. [subtle, haunting notes] Speculation is that it may have been a temporary resting spot to delay effects of the hot sun until the body could be properly examined, the necessity of which is debatable. [music title: Finding God in broken glass] [light chimes throughout ambience] [higher synth notes play slow melody over synth bass] [sounds like synth vocalization. No words] Well first of all, a couple named Richards decided to put a newer tombstone at Baker Cemetery. I think they were trying to keep the history alive. I didn't speak to them about it I don't know exactly what their thoughts were. And this one included Betsey's name. There are… So people assume because the tombstone is there with her name on it that she's buried there [music present but in background] In all our research we found a lot of different stories. And um the one that she was buried under the scaffolding after the hanging, if it's true, she couldn't have been buried very long because there was an article in the New York Times in 1845 that talked about her autopsy. And in the autopsy they found that her stomach was… Had pieces of brick and glass where she tried to commit suicide like that to cheat the hangman. And so if they'd have buried her I don't think they would have just dug her up. I don't. It didn't make any sense that she was buried underneath the scaffolding. The other things that I read that seemed the most feasible to me and the research I did showed that this is what they did with a lot of murderers at the time was they weren't to be buried on ground that had been blessed or hollowed ground, which were the cemeteries were, since they had committed murder. So they usually buried them outside the gates or the fence instead of inside the cemetery. So from what I read there's an entrance at the old Lawrenceville Cemetery and that she was buried outside the gate. And there was some kind of depression you could see there for years. And that supposedly was where Betsey was buried. [haunting ambience continues. Chimes] Some people they still argue to this day what happened after she was hung. And this is where the real mystery comes in. Because it doesn't matter who you talk to everybody's got a different opinion on this. There's some historical accounts that state she was hung (buried) right there on the old where the old football field at right underneath the gallows. And the historical records show in some of the records that the doctors and there was a group of medical students that dug up her body and used it you know for examination. Used it for medical purposes, back in the day. That's one story. Another story is the family actually dug up Elizabeth Reed and brought her to where we are currently standing today, which is Baker Cemetery. And that's the whole mystery behind this thing too. Is she actually buried here? Those people that claim she's not. There's hardcore skeptics that say she is not buried in the cemetery. [gentle but ominous ambience continues] [sounds like synthesized vocalization. No words] (Roger Creed) Okay I lived in this area for about 40 years, about a mile a half up the road here. I was on the cemetery board for about eight years back in the late 90s early 2000's. And our duties were to repair stones and trim brush. This guy had this dowsing rod that he used to find graves. When he located the grave we would try to find to see if there was a missing stone. [chimes] And he went over to Betsey's grave, just for the heck of it, and he found actually two graves there. And we were poking around trying to find maybe another stone and I found a I found that stone it's got “ER” on it. I dug it up. Re-buried it because I didn't want somebody to come along steal it. But since then somebody has placed it in concrete, not exactly in the place that I found it but somebody has placed it in concrete. [music ended] [new ambient music slowly fades in] [long synth notes with echoes throughout] [very eerie and creepy] [bell chimes in the distance] [deep, base thuds] [music title: Death by murder death by hanging ] [long, synthesizer base note continues to hold] [bell in the distance] [obscure noises and echoes] [possible synth voices, male] [sounds like, "ahhhhhhhhhh"] [no words, only ambient music] (Snider) Some of the paranormal activity and claims that we have heard about and even experienced ourselves in the cemetery: People have reported seeing Elizabeth Reed walk around in here in a white dress. And if you look at the historical accounts that's what they say she was buried in because she was hung in her white dress. She rode to her execution site on top of coffin in a white dress. People reported seeing Elizabeth Reed walking around here at all hours of the night and even daytime reports of a lady in a white dress here. That's one of the ghost stories you know behind this cemetery, that she still walks the cemetery grounds. And people have also reported seeing her go up and down the lane of the cemetery. That's one of the cool ghost stories behind this place. And it's got to have some type of evidence behind… Some type of real thing going on because there's been so many people report this event that we can't really discount it as people's imaginations because there's been so many people see and experience that. People actually told me that they see something white move out of the corner of their eye and they'll turn and look and it's not there. It's never a defined shape, a dress or anything. It's just a white blur. And multiple people have told stories that didn't associate with each other. They just came to me and said, “hey I was there and this is what I experienced.” It's weird when more than one person tells you (Snider) For sure. A story that when they weren't together when it happened. We have some records that state that she was buried underneath the gallows when the doctors did the autopsy. ([ambience continues) But if she was buried there she wasn't buried there to stay there. Then there was the idea that she was going to be buried in the city cemetery. The upstanding ladies of the town were not about to have this “bloodthirsty tigress” buried in their cemetery. And so in the play I had some upstanding women of the community stop them from burying her in the cemetery. And those women repeated some of the items that were supposedly given in her confession that was to be published. And they also gave some other items that I found in newspaper reports. But then we believe that her body was removed. If she was buried in the city cemetery it was removed and then buried in Crawford County or close to that line by some relatives of the family. I believe that she her body was removed from and reinterred at the Baker Cemetery in Crawford County. I accept that notion. Okay there is the mystery is she buried here or not. My opinion is that she that she is. Of course I don't know. Nobody knows. But some of the things I've seen and heard I believe she is buried here. I was talking to an old timer up the road here and his grandfather, I believe it was his grandfather, said that one night he looked over here and saw a bunch of lights. So he came over here to see what was going on and he found several men with shovels and lanterns, horses and a wagon. And he asked them what they were doing and they said, “This is none of your concern you need to leave.” So he left. And that's the night that we think she was reburied by family members. [bell tolls in distance throughout ambience] Yeah I mean and you know we've kind of backed up a lot of the claims here too with scientific evidence. We try to rule out out all natural explanations before we come to the determination a location's haunted. We've brought a lot of equipment out here over the years. We've used emf meters, thermal imaging cameras. We've set up infrared camera systems. We've been out here night after night trying to collect evidence of paranormal activity out here. One of the strange occurrences that do take place out here are strange electromagnetic field spikes. We've had our tri-field meter like just spike out here. We've had emf meters go to like anywhere from 3.2 to 7.2 milligauss for no reason. We've documented and recorded strange electromagnetic field phenomena out here, balls of light, just everything you can imagine from strange feelings to people smelling things. I mean a lot of people will also report the smell of chocolate out here, which is kind of weird because this is another paranormal event that's associated with this cemetery that's not what really related to the Betsey Reed story. But over in that part of the cemetery, over here, there's a Heath buried over there. The Heath family. And if you look back into Crawford County history the Heath bar was actually invented in Robinson, I believe. (Dickerson) Mmmhmmm You've got some of the Heaths buried here in Baker Cemetery and (chuckles) people report the smell of chocolate, which is really strange. On one of my haunted tours, this is kind of strange, I had a psychic come up to me. And this psychic, and this has happened on two different occasions, two different people that claim to be psychic have told me the same story. They said that Elizabeth dances over here and she likes it when I bring people here on haunted tours. And they say that she dances around over here in the corner. [background ambience very soft] [faint echoes and airy sounds] [ambient noises fade away] Here at Baker, over the times that we've been investigating, we'll get one lead and we'll think that, “Okay this is the story and this is it.” And then… I'm a big believer in synchronicity and I don't think anything's a coincidence. And it just seems odd that when we're looking for something, something pops up that has something to do with what we're looking for. So in the process of investigating this place, I mean there's probably three or four other places that we need to investigate that's attached to this place. No one really knows. No one documented the story so it's all hand-me-down stuff. And one person says you know, “Well my family member knows this and said this”… None of it's documented so there's no written proof. Everything is a story. There's no there's no truth that you can actually read like look it up. Cold hard fact this is what happened. I think that's part of the mystery of the place. I think that's what draws everybody here. [music begins. Synthesized female vocalization.] [haunting melody] [music title: Beyond the grave] (Narrator) This is the story of Elizabeth Betsey Reed whose alleged crime, attempted escape trial, conviction, execution, and burial are debated to this day. Modern perceptions lead many to look upon the settlers of the 1800's as backwater, superstitious hicks the Reed case wasn't deliberated by the superstitious or the ignorant. Rather, it was judged by the Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, argued by a former attorney general, and a future Illinois governor. The challenges the pioneers faced and overcame on a daily basis would overwhelm the majority of citizens today. Modern misconceptions allow us to dismiss the fantastic in the light of day while haunting our dreams at night. [haunting angelic vocalization and eerie synth] (Narrator) We leave you with one final mysterious piece of evidence that has been provided by the Crawford County Illinois Ghost Hunters: An evp recording which they believe is a direct answer to the question, “Betsey, did you kill your husband?” [music ends sharply] [White noise] [difficult to understand female voice] [repeats phrase] (sounds like, “I'm Innocent”) [somber synthesizer music] [rhythmic beat and repeating 3 note melody] [music title: Discovery] [music fades to end]
