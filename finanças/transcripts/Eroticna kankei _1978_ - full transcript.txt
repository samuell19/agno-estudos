What is? These suicides for unknown causes. Troublesome Trend, The Third Suicide. Repeated Suicide of Famous People. - You?ve got nothing to worry about. - Huh? Because all of them are famous elderlies. They probably don?t have anything fun to live for. It?s not like I have anything to look forward to either. Really? Is that so? I?m sick of listening to them. I?m sick of giving excuses. They?re so persistent. Hello, this is the office of private detective Kotaro Higaki. You?re calling to request an investigation? No 35: Kotaro Higaki Private Detective Office Ouch! Kotaro Higaki Private Detective Office Excuse me, I called earlier... You must be Mr. Kurokawa. Please, come in. The president is currently busy, so please wait here. You can let him in now. Alright, please come in. This way, please. Excuse me. I don?t have a lot of time, so please get right to the point. Yes, well... Actu-actually... Oh, she?s my secretary, Miki. Please, don?t worry. Actually, I have this woman on the side. I completely understand. Her name is Chieko, but she was recently taken from me. Oh, so she was taken... Yes, it?s unfortunate... So, then... That?s when I found you in the yellow pages. Kotaro Higaki, it?s a great name. Indeed it is. So, then, you want me to look into it? When I met Chieko, I was truly happy. When I think about those days... Why don?t you have some? It?ll calm your nerves. I?ll contact you. I prefer... no, I definitely don?t want anyone to find out about it. Don?t be concerned about that. Um... would 300,000 yen be sufficient as a deposit? 3... 300,000 yen. - Of course. - Well then. I?ll prepare the receipt right away. - Thank you for coming. - I?m counting on you. I?ll do my very best! Do what needs to be done. President of Kurokawa Building Company, Hideo Kurokawa. Investigating his love affair doesn?t sound too interesting. You can?t be choosy. We hardly get any clients. The deposit... Where should we go tonight? Ouch. Where should we go? After our work out, we had a relaxing night out for a change. Furthermore, Miki?s appetite was healthy just as always. And her appetite was just as healthy when we got home. What?s the matter? Come on! She took a lot longer than usual. No... I need to stop. When I see a beautiful woman, I envision them coming out of the bathtub. I?ve failed tailing people because of it in the past. I need to stop. Which floor? It's the same, thank you. No problem. Welcome. I'm counting on you. This place is for women only. Men aren?t allowed here! Manager, Chieko Mizusawa said she?ll come to your office later. Okay. Parking Violation Notice Thanks for earlier. We were on the same elevator and I couldn?t take my eyes off of her. You?re a strange one. - Is she a friend of the manager? - She?s a special member. What does a "special member" mean? - You know what it means. - I see. Of course. - Not at all picky. - Her? The manager. It all happens in his office. In his office... He has a plush carpet and a bed in there. I wanted to ask if there was a bathtub as well... But I didn?t. I guess you?re not picky either. Huh? Parking Violation Notice What is going on? There?s more than one lover? No, that can?t be it. A guy that old can?t be her lover. However... Oh! - It?s been a while. - You?re so beautiful, I can?t stand it. You haven?t changed at all. You haven?t change a bit too. So, which pretty woman are you in pursuit of now? The two that came in, have they been coming here? No, it?s recent. They?re really loud. - Is it that bad? - Especially the woman. - What?s the matter? - Nothing. That old man, who is he? We don?t ask questions in this line of business. Isn?t that your job? I?m just asking for a little help doing my job. I just want a little bit of your cooperation. I want to help you, but... - ...you?re putting me in a difficult situation. - You helped me before. - But... - I won?t cause you any trouble. But you?re really putting me in a difficult position. But I?m begging you. Please. But I?ll get in trouble. But please... You're always... ...like this. I was used to greasy ones because of Miki. But this one?s even greasier. There?s a woman like that in this world, and yet... ...I have to fiddle around with something like this. At this point, I just need to get it done. I need to hurry. Will you help me? Will you? I'll do it. What's the matter? What room are they in? It?s okay. Once is never enough for them. You?re such a bad boy... Making me go wild like this... How was it? Were you able to take pictures? Yeah... Did you record them? Yeah... Were they wild? Tell me about it! Actually, that woman had more than one lover. - She?s something. - She doesn?t look the part though. Is she pretty? She?s out of this world. Letting a woman like that go is foolish! You tell that to the client... ...and you won?t be able to ask for any further payments. In any case, I?m not doing this. I?m not taking the case. Don?t tell me you?ve fallen for her too. No, it?s not that. That woman smiled at me. She winked at me. What are you talking about? And? As I explained everything to Miki, I could only think about that woman. Even after I was done talking, her appearance didn?t leave me. I got it! The woman must have figured out you were the private detective that Kurokawa hired... ...and so she was trying to befriend you, so that you wouldn?t leak the information to him. She?s going to want those pictures and the recordings that prove her infidelity. Yeah, that sounds possible... That has to be it! The problem is, which one will pay more? Kurokawa or the woman? You just need to pick! You?re lucky! You can?t go wrong. What do you want me to do? Just continue investigating her and see what she does next. Up until now, doing what Miki said had always been right... ...but I don?t want to make any deals that would make that woman suffer. That?s why I didn?t want to take this case. I was expecting you. I... No, don?t say anything. I was dreaming. I figured I would wake up from the dream. But if this were a dream... But if this were a dream, I don?t want to wake up. Ever. - I want to ask you something. - I wanted to talk to you too. You think I?m a bad woman. Having affairs with one man after another. But that?s something I?m doing for Kurokawa. Kurokawa?s true enterprise is blackmailing. He makes me get close to wealthy men and uses it to blackmail them. The reason he came to you is because he wanted pictures to use for blackmailing the men. Three years ago, I was his secretary, and he took me by force. I was poor until then. So, having him care for me felt like happiness. I was stupid. It took me a year to realize how evil he was. He told me to go on a trip with a bank executive. I?ve been his puppet since then. That?s why I knew you were following me from the beginning. I had a few of them follow me. But when I saw you... I thought, ?I can tell him everything. He can get me out of this life.? - Why me? - Because I like you. I can?t believe you. Then, I guess you won?t help me. I guess it?s impossible to believe someone like me. - I just... - I like you. Please, take me and run. I only have you. Even if we did run away, what would we do in the long run? That?s why we need go see Kurokawa. And... I didn?t even think about Miki. I just didn?t want to lose this woman. What are you doing here? I told you that I would contact you. It was an emergency. Just like you requested, I?ve taken photographs and recorded her... ...and her lover in action. Great, I?ll take them. How much are you willing to pay? What do you mean? It looks like the proof I obtained is more for the men having the affair than you. What do you mean? In short, blackmail. That?s ridiculous. Then, I guess I?ll visit the man in the photographs. I?m guessing he?ll pay me ten times as much as you have. Wait. I?ll give you 1,000,000. I can?t give you more than that. 2,000,000. I won?t ask for more. - How did it go? - I?m giving the photographs and the tapes. It?s settled, then? How much did you settle for? I don?t have time. I?m in a rush. You settled without even consulting me and you won?t even explain it to me? Why do I have to consult with you on everything? Why do I have to explain everything to you? I have my own money. Very well. I didn?t mean it like that. I just like you. Miki. - What? - I?m sorry for yelling at you. I?ll be waiting. - Looks like no one is here. - I?m supposed to use the backdoor. The photographs and the tapes? You don?t know what Kurokawa would do. Take it. Why do you have something like that? Kurokawa had it. I couldn?t go on living if something were to happen to you. Come in. Give me the photographs and the tape. Money first! You should?ve just done what I asked you to do. You know too much now. But it?s unlike you... ...to not realize the fact that making you come here today was to shut you up forever... ...or should I say, it?s very like you. - Don?t shoot! - Chieko! Please, don?t shoot him! You two! It can?t be. That?s right. We?re... Damn it! Don't shoot! Are you alright, Chieko? He?s dead. Don?t touch him. We have to run! Where are we going? After I?m dropping you off, the police station... - The police station? - Yeah, I?ll give myself in. You tell them that you were at home the whole time and don?t know anything. Have a happy life without Kurokawa. No, I can't. This is all my fault. I can?t let you go to the police on your own. Please, don?t leave me. Please, come in. I shouldn?t have given this to you. But if I didn?t shoot, I would have been shot. He?s despicable. He had no intention, of paying in the first place. What are we supposed to do now? Is it in the papers? It?s not in the papers. His body is probably being found right about now. But no one saw us. Nobody should know that we were there. Do you regret it? No. I really am a bad woman for getting you involved in something like this. I don?t regret a thing! If only we had money... That's right. We have the photographs and the tape. - You stay here. - Are you alright on your own? I?ll do it right this time. - Excuse me. - Yes? I want to see the Director. May I ask who?s asking? You can tell him that I?m here in regards to Chieko Mizusawa. Okay! Stop it! I actually don?t want to do something like this. It must be Kurokawa. You?ll buy them? Alright! I get it, so please stop! 3,000,000 in cash, right now. Hold on. There?s no way I can prepare that kind of money this instant. - You. - Chieko! I won?t let you claim that there isn?t that much cash in a hospital of this size. You?re working together?! You?re a despicable woman. Don?t talk to her that way! Tell Kurokawa. He?ll someday get... Chieko! This way, there?s a stairway that he used when he wanted to sneak away with me. Hurry up! What? Your president is away on a trip? He had some personal business to attend to and left yesterday afternoon. - Did you have an appointment with him? - Not exactly. Do you know where? I?m sorry, I don?t know that. I had no other choice. I was worried about you, so I went to see and then he said that to me. I lost control. I was so mad and out of control, I shot him. Please understand. I understand. I do understand. The only good thing is that you weren?t seen. - But you... - I?ll be fine. More importantly, we have to figure out what to do now. Hold me. Make love to me. I?ll do it. The fitness club manager. I?ll go to him, so that you can photograph and tape us. Don't do it. I won?t let you do such a thing. But... Don?t worry about it. Just leave it to me. Is it true what you said on the phone? - What? - That you wanted to see me again? Yeah, it's true! When I woke up and brushed my teeth, I just couldn?t get the image of you out of my mind! You say that now... ...but you?re thinking of doing something nasty, aren?t you? I felt sick from the smell of cheap perfume and sweat. I tried to imagine the beautiful appearance of Chieko. But I couldn't. I?m drunk! I don?t care what happens now! Oh my! You! She was a woman that smelled like a lot of different things in many different places. I was raped. No matter what anybody says, this was rape. - I?m sorry. - It?s alright. But are you pregnant? Is it the manager? I?m not the only one who was forced into his office. There are many women at the fitness club. He?s awful. Why does everyone keep quiet? Because it?s not something we want to make public. And there are many that are happy about it. Like that woman the other day. Do you not like me anymore? Hey, how about it? I just... ...felt sorry for this girl. I'm so happy! I pitied her. I understood! Hey, you! Can?t you see the no parking sign? I?m very sorry. - Move your car. - I?m very tired. Manager's Office Come in. Is it you that wants to talk to me? Have a sit. Thank you. You work out a lot. You?re in great shape. Whatever! And? What did you want to talk about? Well, I just heard some... Heard what? Well, some negative rumors about you. Be direct. What are you talking about? To be direct... ...the rumor is that you force quite a number of women... ...at this fitness club to have sex with you. - What about it? - Huh? What?s wrong with me having fun with women? Oh my. Um, if the public were to find out... ...that may have a negative impact on your business. What are you talking about? The women love it. I guess I should ask you to leave. Get in here. No, I didn?t come here to... You were thinking of blackmailing me, right? I guess you thought wrong. Something wrong? He?s going home. Politely show him the way out. No, I didn?t mean to. I really hate... I'm sorry. Don?t say a word. Do you want to sleep on the bed? No, this is fine. Where are you going? - I?ll go see Tasaki and settle things with him. - Don?t do it. - He?s not the type of man you can deal with. - Don?t worry. I know how to handle him. Please, let me go. No! Stop! If you?re going, I?m going with you! Alright, I?ll listen to you. It?s you again! I guess you haven?t had enough. Look, she?s enjoying herself. If you don?t leave soon, you?ll get hurt again! No, that?s not it. I was forced to! You bastard! Let me go! How dare you?! No, she wanted... He?s a monster! As soon as he saw me, he pushed me down on the bed. We have to go quickly. We need money. There was another man Kurokawa was trying to blackmail. - Are you thinking of blackmailing again? - We have to if we want to live together. Hey, it?s been awhile. - How is Kosuke? - That?s the thing, he hasn?t been home. I?ve tried all the local spots, but he?s nowhere to be found. Did you get into a fight? Look at this. What? This is our paper. Fitness Club Manager Shot to Death. The Police Department creates a Montage of the Suspect. Doesn?t that montage look like my man? I see, he kind of does look like him. But Kotaro is not the type to commit murder. I hope so. And? What did you want me to do? So, just like we planned, okay? Even if it was our plan... ...thinking about Chieko having sex with another man in there... ...made me want to scream. Who are you? How dare you touch my woman? Damn it! So, you two are in on it! Chieko! Chieko! Chieko! Where did Chieko go? Why did she disappear? I couldn?t think anymore. In the car that you smashed... ...there was evidence that links you to the murder victim. You don?t need to give me excuses, just read the paper. Do you understand? You?re done. The police will be here soon. It's a lie! It?s not in the papers, but the only one I killed was Kurokawa. Explain it to me. What exactly happened? I told everything to Miki. That's all of it. What do I do? There?s a rich old lady named Ayako Ichinose in Ayamegaoka. She lives there with a young mistress right now... ...but she used to own an antique shop. Chieko used to work there. That?s where she met Kurokawa. Kurokawa was into antiques and frequented the shop and was part of a group of antique lovers. In that group, there was the hospital director, Sayama. Tasaki from the fitness club. And Nakamura, the camera man. It doesn?t stop there. Those that became known because of the ?troubling trend suicides'. The college professor, Yasukichi Karashima. The high end property manager, Kenichi Tono. And, finally, the author Hajime Yamaguchi, were also part of the group. What does that mean? We?ll find out when we go meet Ayako Ichinose. The madam is this way. She hanged herself. When? When I came back in the afternoon, she was already gone. If I hadn?t gone out, this wouldn?t have happened. The doctor? Do you have any idea why? Where were you? This morning, there was a call from a woman who used to work for her before I did, Chieko. From Chieko? And then? She was going away to Kitakaruizawa for a while, so she wanted to give the madam something. What was it? She said there was no longer any reason to give it. And when I returned, she was already gone. Chieko said she was going to Kitakaruizawa, yes? Why did you leave me, madam? Why, madam? There?s too much I don?t understand. Miki can lose it sometimes, but she?s a lot better than me. I should just leave everything up to her. But, even so... Honey... You?re still thinking about that woman. You can?t leave me, you know. You can?t get away from me. Nap time is over, miss. Looks like you?re still sleeping. I guess I should stop now. I need you to be able to talk. I have a million questions to ask you! First of all... ...who tampered with the car brakes and almost killed my man? I know you?re working with someone. Who are you working with and for what?! Say something! So, how was it? Who tried to kill my man? Honey! How dare you?! You brat! Do you feel like answering now? Huh? Not even one bit. Not to you! Damn you! Miki! Stop, Miki! - Stop! - Let me go! Let me go! You?re an idiot! Damn you! Stop that, Miki! Come here! Stop, Miki! Stop, Miki! Stop it! Let me go! Stop it! Miki! That?s Ayako Ichinose. That?s the author Hajime Yamaguchi and Osamu Tasaki from the fitness club. The camera man, Yuzo Nakamura. The college professor, Yasukichi Karashima. The hospital director, Daisuke Sayama. The high end property owner, Kenichi Tono. And, finally, Kurokawa. This is it. This is the beginning of all it. Two Runaway Girls Found Mutilated and Murdered. Chieko, talk to me. Please, tell me. Tell me the truth. That house... ...was a place for a secret club. After that incident, Ayako stopped working... ...and she used those tapes to blackmail those men. The men paid without saying anything. But one of them killed himself recently. And the rest of them became agitated. And then another one and another one... They killed themselves. Sayama couldn?t take it anymore. And he suggested confessing. So, Kurokawa decided he was going to get rid of the rest... ...and hired you to use as a scapegoat. But Kurokawa... He... Kurokawa... Chieko, wake up. Chieko, hang in there! Don?t worry. These type of women are tough. She?ll wake up soon enough with some water. Chieko! Chieko! Who is it? Who tried to kill me? The one who killed Ayako and took the tape. Who was it? It looks like you want to see me. Kurokawa! You killed me. But that gun had blanks. The blood on my chest was fake as well. This time... ...you?re going to die, and for real. Wait! Wait! Honey! Miki... Chieko... Forgive me. Please, forgive me. It's over. Everything is over. I loved you. No, I still love you. Chieko... You?re Kotaro Higaki, yes? - Yes... - We're the police. Come with us. Higaki, your lawyer is here. Miki! Honey! Mr. Higaki, you?ll be out in no time. I?ve already made the arrangements, so please don?t worry. I wanted to tell the lawyer not to hurry... ...but I couldn?t say that in front of Miki. Honey. I can't wait. Yup, me neither. THE END
