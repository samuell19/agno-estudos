SUMMER GAMES What are you doing? Come and help. We have to put up the tent. - Let me go. Hi. Can I play too? No, not now. Get off. Come on. - No. What's going on? They won't let me play. We made the track! And is the sand yours? What the fuck are you doing? Let me go. Shit. That hurts. Get off me. Are you crazy? Give up. - Let him go. Stop. Idiot! You're strong, aren't you? At least apologize. Let's go. Marie! What happened? - Nothing. What, nothing? Who was it? You know him? Does it hurt? Come here, cherie. Leave me alone. Don't speak French to me. Not again! What should I do? - It's the age. She exaggerates. I didn't do anything. It's an emergency. We'll pay later. Okay. What is that? - I want to find him. Cardelli, there are so many... Tear the page out. Who is it? You know her? Attention, the 1 5h55 Roma-Livorno is now arriving on platform 2. Don't get off. You'll regret it. I can't. - Come back to Rome. Mama, don't stress me. I have to go. Agostino, my love. Ali, go, there are customers. Two proseccos and two lemon teas. Tea is over there. Shall we get some chips? Give me the whole bottle of prosecco. You work here? - I help my father. Ali, don't talk, do your work. You like it here? You're weird, you had a fight with Papa? It's you two who fight all the time. True. Sometimes. Adriana! C'mon, smile. Nic! Come! Tomorrow we'll rent bikes. A toast. To these two weeks! To be spent in peace. What do you want? Get lost! What are you looking at? Punch me and we're even. You do it. Ok. I'll do it. Now we're even. Idiot! Didn't you feel like it? Yes. - Didn't look like it. Whatever. Why did you come back? - For the kids. Only for them? Vince, I want things to be better. So it's not just for the kids? Let's hope not. 8, 3, 3, 9, 6, 7. How many left? 4 haven't answered. Must be one of them. And if he answers? - If only. And if he doesn't want to see you? He does. - Hello? Hello? Lorenzo Cardelli? No, wrong number. - Sorry. Good morning. - Good morning. Hope the music's not a bother. No, he plays well. Go away! Scram! Hey, guys, I found a weird thing. There's a body in a shed. You sure? - It's not moving. Where? Back there. Here. Careful. A scarecrow! - Looked like a body. It's better this way. You have these in Geneva? You're cool. You know what it's for? I'm not stupid. Agostino, give me the plane. Let's put something in it. A spider. Gross! A lizard. I'll put some grass in. Me too. It'll like flying. Wait. We need music. Let's see who finds it first. Here. It's not moving. You killed it. Poorthing. Let's bury it. What's going on? - Run! What are you doing here? If I catch you, I'll show you. You understand? You can't come here. How good are the Fogarina grapes How good it is to know how to harvest it Making love with my sweetheart Making love in the field. Can we go? Aren't we playing cards? Some other time, aunt. Made new friends? Hope it's not the beach crowd. Don't be late. It's closed. I knew it. We each have to tell a secret. Something you never told anyone. Then you drink. And no spitting. - Cool. You start. I don't like my name. Why? - Because it doesn't change. For example: Peppino becomes Peppe. You want to be called Peppe? No, Justin. - We'll call you Justin then. I knew that already. Tell another one. I'm scared of the water. When you look down, you can't see anything. Paty, it's up to you. I'm afraid of spiders. You first. I'm ashamed of my father. - Why? Because he can't speak Italian. Marie, it's your turn. I don't have secrets. That's my secret. Doesn't count. Of course you have one. Everyone does. Now it's your turn. I can't feel anything. You can do what you like to me. Really? - Yes. Bet it's not true. Try me. Hurry up. It's late. How don't you feel anything? I want to know, Nic. It's not easy. You have to concentrate. Then? Show me. Imagine you're not you. Someone who does not feel anything, a different person. Looking for something? Porto Santo Stefano. Nothing interesting there. I'd like to go. I'm not in the mood. Not now. I'm doing it to protect you. You do it for yourself. I didn't ask you to. - Stop it. That's all you think about. Enough, dear. Let's go to the beach. You know him? I promised not to say anything. Why don't you tell her what happened? She's too little. You're wrong. I can't. - Why not? I just can't. Let's go. If you want to return the same day, you have to take the bus to Porto Santo Stefano at 09h05 which already left. The stop is there. At the station there's a train for Orbetello, then another bus. It takes 2 and 1/2 hours. There's not a more direct way? You can swim it. That's direct. Enough. - Don't laugh, concentrate. I can't. - Imagine you're not you. Not bad. Let's play a game. One of us is a killer. The others hide in the field. The killer has to get one of us, bring him here and do what he wants to him. I'll count to 10. You all hide. 1, 2... - Wait. We need an policeman. One who catches the killer. Give me the hat. I'll do it. Do you want a cigarette too? You afraid I'll catch you? You be the killer. 1, 2, 3... Gotcha! Safe! 450. Another 82 euros. I'll bring them tomorrow. Excuse me... What's up? - He's 82 euros short. You have to pay in advance,you know that. Believe me, I'm gonna pay... You told me you'd come the other day and you didn't. You make good money here, can't you make an exception? Or you take back your money and leave. Or you give back the fridge and move to the area, where it costs less. No, we'll stay. Give him the rest. 184. You'll regret it. What did you say? Let's go. - You'll die of cancer. Vince, it's only 200 meters. I don't give a shit. I'll bust his face. Don't swear in front of the kids! I'll go for a beer or this'll end badly. C'mon boys, we'll do it ourselves. C'mon. We can't do it. You're useless. Can I help? Yes, thanks. - You're welcome. What's this? A shell. - No. A maze. And this? Grass. - A lightning bolt. These are symbols the Etruscans put into the graves. Kids! Papa's here. Let's go. Let's drink the prosecco,it's still cold. Shall I heat up some pasta? I'm not hungry. Boys, with the money I saved we'll go to the acquapark. Happy? Yes. I'll soon get paid for my last job. Why didn't you ask me? - You? I don't work at the cash anymore, I work in the office now. Now you tell me? I was waiting for the right time. You should have told me right away. What did you do? Nothing. I didn't do anything. Boys, go to bed. Good night, my love. And dessert? - Later. Why didn't you tell me right away? There has to be a reason. You're hiding things from me? You told your mother? Leave her out of it. She puts ideas in your head! I know it's her! - Excuse me. Excuse me, calm down, please. This is between me and my wife. We're neighbours, let's get along. Mind your own business or you'll get it! You have to stop going against me. You're my wife! Who the hell do you thinkyou are? Just doing what you want. Not with me! Never. Listen, it's Justin... Nothing happened... - What a smell... I'll do it. Here, go get some croissants. You catch that? My father. I drove the dinghy. You know how? - Yes, it's easy. 4 euros. You're still here? I thought you'd gone. Where are you now? Around here. From me. I have money.- Just a sign of friendship. Marie. Where are you going? You want a croissant? - No. Need a ride? You'll come back to play at the shed? It's not true. Where're you going? That's your secret. You really want to know? I'm going to my father. What kind of secret is that? I've never met him. So, why you want to meet him? He's my father. I want to know what he's like. Want to see something? It happened in Rome. The day we left. What are you doing with that plant? I'm leaving it with my mother. Your mother! Can't you see the car is full? Are you doing it on purpose? Fuck you. How could he do that? Your father's an arsehole. Why did you show me that? My father's not like that. How do you know? You don't know him. Alright. That's enough. Did you see I brought flowers for Mama? What's wrong? Go look for her. Tell her we're waiting. Why? - I want to apologize. Adriana, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Please, forgive me. Stop it. What do you know about it? I know, he pissed himself last night. That girl yesterday, she's too good for you. Excuse me... sorry... I wanted to take the 10 o'clock train to Orbetello. It's Saturday, there's only the afternoon train. The girls? They must be with their friends. I don't want you to see me like this. Hide. Patty's the killer. You're back? Did you find him? I'll go another time. Catch me I'm here. Fasteryou slowpoke! - Enough! I'm safe! It's not fair. I caught you, didn't I? Lie down. Slither, little worm. Looks like a worm to you? Do it right! Not like that. You're tougher than her. Now, we'll see who's tougher. You're not afraid, are you? On your knees! Let's blindfold her. Let's do acupuncture. Hold her arm. Imagine it's not you, it's your doll. It's not me. They're just killing me. Concentrate. Wait. The pin. Are you crazy? Couldn't do it. Too bad. You're not normal. We sing "Vamos a bailar". I dedicate this song to my father. I wanted to say goodbye to the past You were a shadow cast over me Now it's time to be new again I'm looking for my island Away from here If at times I thought that it was impossible I have nothing to lose but you! Great! You have "Piccola e fragile"? That was beautiful. - What? The way you looked at me. I wasn't. I couldn't see anything. But you were. - You're wrong. I thought you didn't feel anything. You act like you never are true Maybe you want to But say no How many breathtaking baths we had And then at nights So close to me You tremble Small and fragile You are to me And I'm making a mess You next to me I looked for you all day long. Where were you? It's not your business. Forgive me. What do I have to do? Nothing. There's nothing left to do. What are you saying? You know. Enough of this. You're despicable. What did you say? You're despicable. I'll kill you! Kill me. You're my life... Kiss me. You're good at it. You never wear colours like that. A bit too flashy? - I like it. Me too. You wear it for that boy? They have problems. They're not normal. You're not normal, either. You're always alone! - By choice. I think it was my father who left you. Marie, enough now! Maybe it's time to talk to her. Paola, don't meddle. Please. You can't get along with anyone, not even with your sister. Only other people have problems, right? I'm the happiest person alive! Good morning. - Good morning. You ok? Yes. I would've wanted to do more the other night. I want you to know that you can count on me. Your husband doesn't frighten me. No need. It won't happen again. You know there are helplines? Or you can go to the police. It's not that bad. - But it is, indeed. If I were you I'd go to the police. I can come with you... as a witness. That's very kind of you. Lie down there. We'll see if you can feel anything. I'll pourwax into your eyes. You'll be blind. Yourfather is terrible and you too. You like to hearthese things? If you want I'll arrest her. Don't move. Where are you, Nic? That isn't your body? Really, you can't feel anything? Give me a cigarette. I'll burn you. Ok? Yes. Ok. Do it... Nic, what are you doing? I didn't feel anything. You're under arrest! Stop. She's dead! Let's kiss her. You start. - You go first. That's not fair. You owe me now! Did you feel anything? - Yes. I didn't. I was someone else. What is this? Does it work? Play something for me. - Not now. Let me show you something. I made if for my father. You like it? Yes. When will you meet him? Tomorrow. Marie, come dinner's ready. I have to go now. Porto Santo Stefano? How about that! Wow, he listens to Mozart! You like it? I've been trying to call you all morning! Leave me alone. - Don't do that again. Your father's not there! Where did he go? - I don't know. You make things more complicated. You're ruining my holidays and yours. I told you everything. Enough now. Let's go back to the campground. Go down. Throw him in! What is it? And the change? 18 euros missing. You gave me 10. No, I gave you a 50. The bill you gave me. - Says who? Vince, there's a queue. We gave them 60 forthe tickets and 20 forthese 4 lousy pizzas. Thieves! - Should I call security? We gave them 50 euros at the entrance. Here. - Thanks. How could you? Bitch! Whore! Shit! Everything ok, Madam? Let me give you a hand, mum. Come back. Sorry, I didn't mean to. Get out. Nic, go with him. Why always me? - Please. You getting on or not? No use going after them. - Shut up. Stop! - You crazy? Nic! Come back! I'm sorry! Drinks for grown-ups. For real men. I know I'm a bad example. It's hereditary. My father was a boor too. You know how he proposed to my mother? He gave her a letter he didn't write. He had someone else do it. Then my mother found out. She never forgave him for it. I'm like him. But you're going to be someone. Understand? Let's go there. - Later. If I hadn't met your mother I'd have been a musician. I would have had another life without family, responsibilities. But if Grandpa was a boor why did you name Agostino after him? Out of respect. He is my father. I won't call my son Vincenzo, anyway. Congratulations. You were great! You can pick one of these 3 prizes here. This one. - Ok, this one's for you. Please. You really want that one? Have a good evening. They're not back yet? They're here. OK, you can sleep with me tonight. Honey, you up already? You're smiling? Why should I be? It's not easy for me either. Tell me something. I shouldn't have married you. I never told you. But it's true. You want to divorce like your mother? Yes, if you ask me like that... You'll leave me with him as yesterday? She can't love. She doesn't even love you. Ok, say things like that to your kids. Look at their faces! Vince, you know it's over too. We'll talk about it at home. Let's have our holiday without dredging it up now. 6... 7... Marie, what's up? - You didn't answer. What should I have said? Did you get the music? - Yes. Why didn't you thank me? I have a present for you. - Keep it. Taken. Walk. You're pretty. Dance! Sexier, like this... Show me your tongue. This way. Say, I want you to fuck me. Say it! I want you to fuck me. Touch my dick. Who you thinkyou are? - Just do it. Let me go! Nic, what are you waiting for? Stop. Police. - Nic... come on... Take him outside. Marie, nothing happened. You didn't stop the game! I thought you didn't feel anything. Nic, come. We have to punish him! Let me go. - Let's make it up. It's not fair. You put a spider on me! Put him down. I'm coming. Let's make peace. - Leave the bike. I can be very bad. - Bust my lip? Hey, where's your father? Shouldn't he be protecting you? Shut up! He doesn't care about you! Otherwise he would have come back. You broke the pipes, you bastards! Don't come here! Understand? Please, tell me where he is. Why did he leave? Was it my fault? Does he even know I exist? Why didn't he ever look for me? Calm down. - I'm going back to Geneva. Wait! Stop. - If you tell me everything. Okay, but stop. You scared the hell out of me. Talk! Your father was unreliable. I was pregnant, wanted to move to Geneva, but he didn't. One night... we argued... and he... - I don't care. I want to know where he is. He had an accident... On the motorway... He died on the spot. My father's dead? I'm so sorry. I don't believe it. He's buried in Porto Santo Stefano. Come here now. I'm so sorry. What did you write? - I won't tell you. Doesn't matter. I'm happy for you. I have something for Marie. I'll give it to her. - No, I should. She doesn't want to talk to anyone. She doesn't leave her room. - Let me try. Marie, it's me. Go away. Leave me alone. Trouble? It's giving me a hard time. Before I got married I had a Vespa. I had to give it a jump-start. I always parked it on a slope. It's nice to ride a bike, you can smell the grass. If it starts we can go for a ride. Really? Let's give it a jump-start. Look, it's a feast. We're in a tomb but here they dance, drink wine, make music... The Etruscans were like that. You know a lot. I'm studying archaeology. For them life was happiness. I'll never be an Etruscan. Here. - What is it? A sign of friendship. - Thank you. Patty, is that you? Go away! Marie, I came to see you. I want to stay with you. Take that off! You want to stay with me? Nic, take that off, please! Hold me. You're crazy. Sick. Hold me, please. - You're disgusting. If you don't, I'll stick this in my arm. Do it! You're an idiot. What do you want? My father is dead! Is he dead? I'm sorry. I don't want to see you ever again. Go! Nic, wait... Go away! Go! Throw a rockstone at him! Fucking dog... Dear guests, for many of you the holidays are ending. So let's have fun and please come back next year. Thank you and goodbye. Gotcha. You are all murderers. You killed my dog with rocks and kicks. What's going on? - They killed my dog. But do they have a family? I'm sorry. I can pay you back. I don't want anything but you'd better not come back to the shed! Go to hell. Arseholes. Yes, you're all arseholes. Ali, come back. You'll pay for this. Don't ever play with them again. What happened? - It was an accident. What do you mean? Tell me what happened. I won't do you no harm. - Later. What do you want from me? Calm down. You're the last person to say anything. C'mon, more music! Marie, you're asleep? - No. That was fun. You should've come. Can I ask you something? - Yes. Have you been to the cemetery? Cherie, think of something else. Yes or no? - No. And I won't go. How do you feel when you think of him? How do I feel...? I don't know. Guilty. But I can't torture myself forthe rest of my life. We're only here fortwo more days. Let's make the best of it. You come to the beach tomorrow? Good night. How's Marie? - She won't go out. Patty, come here! Tell her she has to go out tomorrow. Why? - My brother's going high-diving but only if we're all there. We'll get up early so no one'll see us. You have to convince her. I'm coming. Your father is cool. - Why? He's lending us his boat. But don't tell him. Justin is gonna dive. - Really? Who told you? - Nic. But only if we're all there. You have to come too. It's the last day. See you. We have to talk. - I'm tired. Tomorrow we're going for a ride in the boat. - Come out. Leave him alone. - Shut up. Where did you sleep last night? What do you care? Your mother and I were worried. - Really? Let's get something to drink. Tonight you sleep here. And you come sleep with me. No, I'll sleep out here. Shit! Enough with this nonsense! I'm not sleeping with you anymore. Stop it. Bastard. Now I'll show you... Leave him! Go ahead. I don't feel anything. See, it doesn't hurt. You have to respect me, got that? I'm your father. Respect? You're an arsehole! I'll call the police. I swear! Can you stay with him, please? Stop. Just you wait, I'll kick you to death! Nic! Help me. I can't move. What are you doing? Go away. I'm disgusting. Leave me alone, really. We have to go already? Isn't it too far for your first dive? Who's diving? - You said you would... Me? Stop! You lied. He's not diving. He doesn't want to anymore. Let's go back then. Not yet... Is this Porto Santo Stefano? - Yes. It can't be. Let's see who finds the grave first. What's the name? - The name is... Lorenzo Cardelli. - When did he die? In 1998. I've found it. What's wrong? - We're out of fuel. We have another tank? Yes, but I have to change the pipe. I've never done it before. Move. Shit, I can't do it. - Let me try. It won't go in. Are you a couple now? Stop it. Go down! C'mon, please. Give up! I did it! Shall we walk back? It's not far. Really? Let's go. You go ahead. We'll walk back. - Sure? It's not that far. First there wins. Should I put some on? Just a little. Does it hurt? Just a little bit... You're burning...
