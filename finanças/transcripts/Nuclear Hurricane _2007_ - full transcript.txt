(whooshing) (somber music) (helicopter buzzing) (thunder rumbling) - [Woman] How much longer? - Just a few more miles. There's an open field were I can put her down but you'll have to collect the party on foot. - Why do they leave people behind when they evacuate? - The last boat couldn't get in due to the storm. They didn't have another way off the island. - So it's you and me to the rescue. - Imagine that, we're saving the army's butt. (laughing) (thunder rumbling) - That damn storm is moving like lightening. We'll be lucky to pick them up and take them back before that island sinks under its own weight. - If it was easy, everybody would be doing it. - Well you can have it. (suspenseful music) - There it is. I'm taking her down. (thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) (helicopter buzzing) - Keep it neutral, pal. I won't be long. - The meter's running. I wouldn't wanna be you. (dramatic music) - Thank God! I thought you guys forgot about us. - Not a chance. The storm's kept most of our birds on the ground. Now you ready to go? - Kelly, let's go! - Hey, no luggage. - But this is all classified material! - I'm sorry, there's no room. It's you or the boxes. - There's gonna be hell to pay! - Yeah, well you gotta be alive for them to collect. Now come on, let's move it or lose it, let's go! Let's go! (dramatic music) - Jesus Christ, people, what's keeping them? - [Radio] This is Moana Bay, do you copy? - Yeah, yeah. I copy. - [Radio] Jerry, that's a hell of a storm headed your way. - Tell me something I don't know. - [Radio] It's bigger than you think. That downpour you're in right now is just a sprinkle compared to what's offshore. - How long have I got? - [Radio] Five minutes, maybe ten, but that's pushing it. (suspenseful music) - They're in sight, I'm as good as gone. - [Radio] Okay, just be careful. There's a tsunami warning for the next two hours. - Tsunami? Okay, I hear you. We'll see you soon, I hope. Over and out. (suspenseful music) Glad you could make it. It's gonna be tight. - Thanks for coming. - Just like the calvary. - Okay, everybody in and get your seat belts fastened. - It's gonna be bumpy but it beats the alternative. - We're just glad that you dropped by when you did. - Get her up, the rain's getting really ugly! - Wanna mention that one more time? (dramatic music) Holy mother of God, we'll be flying upside down if this doesn't let up. - Will you please clear those hills or we're gonna be flying with the angels! - I'm giving her the gas but it's like we're stuck in the mud. - We're gonna make it, right? - We're gonna try. (thunder rumbling) - Hey, partner. - Yeah, what is it? - Oh my God! Look! (whooshing) (rumbling) (electrical fizzling) (dramatic music) (seagulls squawking) (somber music) (alarm beeping) (groaning) (wind whooshing) (phone ringing) - Control room. Hey, Butch. No, you don't have to come in today. You go and get your family a shelter if you can. It's all run by computer anyway. You and me, we better start looking for another job. (siren alarming) Hey Butch, I spoke too soon, gotta go. (dramatic music) Rusty, it's Al. Your baby's acting up again. One month on the job and she's already complaining. All right. (ominous music) Keep it up. We'll all be in the dark soon. (food sizzling) - Breakfast is almost ready. - Okay, I'll be right there. - [TV Reporter] Evacuation orders were issued for Poliahu as well as the other outlying islands late yesterday. Meanwhile, at the tide, 60 mile per hour winds are coming in from offshore. The storm center will arrive on Pele by approximately 4 PM this afternoon. There has been no communication with the western island since 2 AM and it's believed that a nuclear material commission helicopter may have gone down in the storm. - Morning. What's this? - Peppers and onions. - Just what I've always wanted. Come on, what is this? - Well open it, goofy. - Okay, fine. Hey, come on. These were Mom's, she gave them to you. - Yeah, I know, but you've always wanted them so happy birthday. - Okay, so you're the best sister ever. Thank you. - You're welcome. (phone ringing) Come on, it's getting cold. - Yeah, okay. (phone ringing) Hello? Oh hey, Erik, what's up? Sure, just a sec. It's that guy, your ex. (shushing) Why you did this, I will never know. - Give it to me. Hello. - Linda? - [Linda] Hey, what's up, I'm busy. - I'm on the island. Can we get together later? - When? What for? - I'd like to see you. (blowing) - Erik! (Linda blowing) Line's breaking up, Erik! Hello? - I'll call back. - Oh, God. (engine rumbling) (phone ringing) - Mm-hmm. Ray's pluming, can I help you? No. Rusty, it's me, what's up? Yeah. Uh huh. Be right there. (wind howling) (ominous music) Hey. How much longer you got? - A few more hours. - Good luck. (wind howling) (ominous music) - Yes, Bob, I understand that we're going to get hit and hit hard but the weather is not our problem. - Morning. - Linda, nice of your to drop by. - Yeah, we've got Rusty's view. What's your take on the security of the facility? - You could drop a bomb on this place, we'd still be snug as a bug. As I hear it, we're having problems with our new computer. - Well the main computer shows that the plant is running foursquare but the backup computer shows that we're having a little problem with the cooling system. - Staci? - [Female Computer Voice] Yes, Linda? How may I help you? - Status report on the cooling system. - [Staci] Cooling system function is normal. - Give me a report on the backup system. - [Staci] Removing safeguards will allow me to access that information. - Negative on that, Staci. - I there a reason that Staci wasn't given access to the back up system? - Yes there is, Jane. If Staci had a virus, she could infect the entire backup system, how's that? - Are you kidding me, Rusty? With all the safeguards and backups we built into that computer, you think it's gonna call in for a sick day? - Look, Seaview invested in the future and the future is Staci. So what's next? (radio buzzing) - We're losing you. - Are you there? - Come on, guys, what's going on? - Hang up and we'll call you back. (Rusty laughing) (siren alarming) (ominous music) (knocking) (glass shattering) (ominous music) - [Bob] Rusty, you there? - Yeah but you better make it quick. We don't know how long these lines are gonna be up. - Well I just think you're using this storm as an excuse. - Just tell us what you're going to do next. - Well, the first thing I'd do is-- - I'm sorry, Rusty, we're asking Linda. - Yeah because she's gonna be taking over for you. (chuckling) - Do you know what they're talking about? Yeah, you do. Since when? - I'm sorry, I thought Bob told you but the NIC-1000 systems is highly advanced. We need someone with a background that Linda has. - Can we discuss all this later? We have bigger fish to fry right now. - Linda, tell us what the next step is. - I think our best bet is to shut down the backup system and reboot and see if the problem corrects itself. - And we are assuming that the problem is in the backup computer and no with the cooling system itself, correct? - Look, guys, this is the first nuclear facility controlled entirely by a computer. The reactor, the communications, the plant security. It's all controlled by the NIC-1000. I know that she's supposed to be perfect and it only takes a handful of techies to run her but she is not perfect, nothing ever is. Look, what we have here is a minor glitch. Just give us the opportunity to fix the problem and it's going to be as simple as all that. - A malfunctioning cooling system could spell disaster. If the water lever around those fuel rods drops, it could lead to a core meltdown. - Jane, I've been in this business for over 20 years. I don't need you or some other suit in Los Angeles talking to me about water levels and core meltdowns, okay?! - Why don't we shut done the backup system and reboot? See if the problem's still there. - Thanks, Linda. I knew we made a good choice with you. - Okay, you wanna shutdown the backup system, let me have the code, please. - [Bob] I don't follow. - It's an anti-terrorist measure, Bob. Now I'm sending an encrypted version of the code now. By the way, Erik from our Hawaiian office flew out last night ahead of the storm. He should be arriving there within the hour. - Erik? Erik as in Erik, Linda's ex? That moro... Why? - Because he developed the operating system you're working with. - You guys, Rusty and I have this under control. We don't need him. - Have him call us when he gets in. (radio crackling) - Dead. Why don't you check to see if the code came through? Boss. (ominous music) - Got it. Listen, Rusty I'm sorry about what just happened. I would've said something, they told me not to. - Why don't we just talk about it later, okay? Right now, I need you to go down, get me the reading from the coolant system for me. I want you to do it on sight, make sure you get suited up for it, okay? And while you're down there, check to make sure that no lights and doors and windows aren't open. (wind howling) - What are you guys still doing here? You were supposed to evacuate. - This is all we have, we couldn't just leave it. - And the truck is in the shop getting a new engine. - Well, your lives are worth more than this old place, you know? Look, just stay put for now and secure the place as best you can. - We've been through this before. We're gonna be okay. - Well, I hope so. The phone lines are down so you're gonna be on your own for awhile, okay? I'll check back on you later. - Okay. (wind howling) - Happy birthday to me. (ominous music) (machinery humming) (computer beeping) - Linda? Linda, do you read? - Yeah. Everything checks out except, I can't seem to access the backup computer from here. - Maybe there's a problem with the security program. Did you punch in your passcode? - Yeah. Just keeps say "Access Denied." - I'll tell you what, why don't you... Why don't you come on home, we'll shut down the backup computer and we'll figure this thing out? - Copy that. (ominous music) (clanking) Unlock door. Unlock door, Staci. (ominous music) (buzzing) Staci, unlock door. Rusty? - [Rusty] Yeah? (door clicking) - Nevermind. (foreboding music) (beeping) (somber music) (distant thundering) (computer keys clicking) (electrical fizzling) (foreboding music) (thunder rumbling) (waves whooshing) (gasping) - They don't tell you about this in those stupid natural birthing classes. Oh, I'm breathing. (sighing) (glass shattering) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (wind howling) Where did I put those car keys? (chimes clinking) (ominous music) - Can you believe that? A power failure in a nuclear power plant? - Right, what are the odds? - Well, the backup generators are online, fully functional. - You know, I couldn't get out of the reactor room. - What do you mean? - I mean, the door wouldn't open. - You might have to check your voice recognition software. You might have to reload it. - And the retinal scan didn't work either. - Well that's probably because of the face plate in your suit. Look, we can talk about this later. - All right. - Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Rusty, how can I help you? - We're about to shutdown the backup computer. I want you to secure all the entrances and exits to the facility, please, on my command. Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to go into a lockdown mode for the next five minutes or so while we do a computer check. This is not an emergency, I repeat, this is not an emergency. Thank you. Staci, lock down now. (alarm buzzing) (ominous beat music) - [Staci] Facility is secured, Rusty. - Thank you, Staci. Linda, prepare to enter the ultra top secret bean counter code, please. - Aye, captain. Ready to enter bean counter code. - [Rusty] Confirm. - Bean counter code, confirmed. All right. Flying solo. - All right, me buckos, prepare to reboot on my command. Wait for it and now. - Aye, captain. Oh, what's that? Houston, we have a problem. - Security Protocol 13. I never heard of it. Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Rusty? - Security Protocol 13, explain please. - [Staci] Security Protocol 13 is designed to secure the main computer system in the event of a backup system failure. - Never heard of it. - Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Linda? - Security Protocol system is keeping us from accessing the backup system. - [Staci] That is correct, Linda. - We don't want that. - Staci, shut down Security Protocol 13, please. - [Staci] Authorization is required for Security Protocol 13 shutdown. - They didn't tell you about this? - Nope. - Prepare for retinal scan. - [Staci] Retinal scan complete. - Staci, shut down Security Protocol 13, please. - [Staci] Permission to shut down Security Protocol 13 is denied. - Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Rusty? - We really need to reboot the backup system. - [Staci] Backup system's reliability factor has been compromised by false data. False data from backup system may compromise main units one and two. - What is she talking about? - I don't know. Staci, explain main units one and two, please. - [Staci] Main units one and two, code named Rusty and Linda, are integral parts of your main computer system. Security Protocol 13 requires protection of Rusty and Lina units. - Great, this Rusty. Shut down Security Protocol 13, please. - [Staci] I'm sorry. You are not authorized to shut down Security Protocol 13. - Okay, there's gotta be a glitch in the retinal scan. - Like my daddy used to say, "Failure is not am option, "it is included in the software." - So, what do we do? - I hate to do this! We have to call those knuckleheads in corporate and tell them we don't know what the hell is going on down here? - [Linda] You want me to do it? - No. Let's just pretend I'm still the boss and I'll make the call. (phone crackling) Oh, what a shame. Can't get an outside line. (wind howling) (ominous music) - Where the hell am I? (thudding) Whoa! (tries screeching) (crunching) (engine stalling) Rental piece of crap. (wind howling) (beeping) - There is absolutely no trace of Security Protocol 13 anywhere. - Maybe it's hiding under another name or it's attached to another program running in the background? (phone ringing) Seaview. - It's me. - Erik, where are you? - I'm on the side of the road somewhere. I think I cracked my engine block. - Where? - Well, the main road was closed so I had to go on the old service road and I think I'm about eight miles east of Maui Kai. - All right, sit tight. We're sending somebody out to get you and don't leave your vehicle. - Linda, you okay? You sound upset. - We got a little problem here. - Really? - What is Security Protocol 13? Erik? Erik, are you there? - Yeah, I'm here. - What's Security Protocol 13? - It's something we developed for Homeland Security. How did you find out about it? - [Linda] Well Staci activated it. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. That's not possible. Protocol 13 needs a security code. - We were given a code by cooperate to shut down the backup system. Could that have anything to do with it? - Well, I suppose those idiots could've given you the wrong code. - All right, well let's not panic. What do we do? - Well, send someone to pick me up and I'll come in and straighten it out. - You know what, I'm coming to get you myself. Sit tight. - Linda? - Yeah? - I've been thinking about you. Us. - Erik, I'll be right there. (wind howling) - Been thinking about you. You want me to go get him? - No, no, we want him alive. - You be careful. (eerie music) - Unlock the door, Staci. Staci, unlock the damn door. Terminate lockdown and unlock the door, Staci. Please. (ominous music) Mm-hmm. Hey, Al. - I'm on my break. - I need a phone. - The phone line's been cutting in and out. Told you. - I need to make a phone call, Al, this is important. - What do you want me to do? - Can you circumvent Staci's com control? Hook me up directly to a phone line? Al. What a guy. (wind howling) - Just hang in there, baby. Take your time, okay? Trust me, you're not missing anything right now. (suspenseful music) Not even born yet and you're already giving me a hard time. - I'm golden. Thanks. (phone ringing) (waves whooshing) (phone ringing) - [Susan] Yep? - Hey, it's me. - Oh hey, what's up? - [Linda] Listen, can you do me a favor? - Sure, shoot. - We have somebody stranded on the old refinery road, just about eight miles east of the main drag. - [Susan] Okay, you need me to get him? - Could you? - Yeah, I'm headed in that direction. I mean, I need to stop and see some people but I can get you guy on the way. Who is it? - It's Erik. - You're kidding. - I'm sorry. Listen, we need him here. This is business. - [Susan] Is everything okay? - Could you just get him over here as soon as possible? - What's going on? - Just get him here, please. - Okay. - How strong are those entry doors? - Made out of steel. Windows are all reinforced. Nobody gonna get in here. - Yeah, nobody's getting out either. Listen, can you get over to maintenance and try to find one of those settling torches. - What for? - We're locked in. Yeah. Go. (dial beeping) - [Staci] How may I serve you, Linda? (foreboding music) (ominous music) (horn honking) - Oh, thank God. (sighing) Thanks for stopping to pick me up. Susan. What a pleasant surprise. - Touch me and I'll break your arm. - Nice to see you too. - [TV Announcer] Hi winds and rain continue to blanket most of the south west island. There's no further word on the fate of that missing Nuclear Materials Commission helicopter. - Any word from Erik? - Oh no, not yet. I tried to call and couldn't get through. - The lines are down. - Did you try his cell? - Yeah, he doesn't answer. - [TV Announcer] We have an update on that story about the missing Nuclear Materials Commission helicopter. Authorities now confirm that it was on a rescue mission to the island of Poliahu and was lost along with the cure and an undetermined amount of homeland security data. Forecasters are predicting the eye of the storm will cross Pele by late this afternoon. - You know, if there really is a problem with that cooling system-- - I'm sure Erik can handle it. After all, he is the one who developed the system. - Assuming he gets there. - Well, if he doesn't, Rusty's there. He can handle anything. - [Bob] Don't start. - Look, letting him go was a mistake. - It was a budgetary decision. We were told to cut costs. Now look, the important thing is we have got to make this work. We can not afford to make any mistakes here. - I'll call New York and apprise them of the situation. - Well, fine, just make sure you couch everything in general terms. We don't need to be scaring anybody. Not yet, anyway. - They need to know the risks involved. - Fine, tell them we're in complete control and we are not, I repeat, not shutting down. Understood? - Yeah. - [TV Announcer] Hit the island with winds above a hundred miles per hour. Shelters have been set up in the area but many people are unable to reach them as the storm continues to surge. - We have a problem. - What happened? I thought you went to go pick up knucklehead. - Yeah, well I couldn't get out. She's got us locked in. - Staci? Terminate lockdown, please. - [Staci] Lockdown can be terminated after reboot of backup computer system. - Okay, reboot the backup compute system then. - [Staci] Reboot of backup computer system require termination of Security Protocol 13. - Terminate Security Protocol 13. - [Staci] Termination of Security Protocol 13 requires authorization. - What a bitch. - Yeah, I think we gotta shut her down. - No, you see, you shut her down, you shut down the reactor. - Yeah, what choice do we have? - See, every day the reactor is down, it's a million dollars. - Yeah but we got a potential disaster on our hands if there's a problem with the cooling system. - Look, Linda, if you wanna shut her down, then you gotta get a hold of corporate and get their approval. - I know and what happens if we can't get through to corporate? - Well, we can classify it as an emergency situation and then we make the decision ourselves. - I say we shut her down. You with me or not? - I don't know, I mean, you're the boss. You should make the call. You know, if you're wrong, they'll fire you. Then you'll come crawling back to me begging my forgiveness. (chuckling) I'm all in. - [Linda] Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Linda, how may I help you? - Shut down the man computer system. - [Staci] I'm sorry, Linda, Security Protocol 13 does not permit system shutdown without backup protection. - Surprise. - Reboot the back... You know what? Let's cut her power. She runs on electricity like the rest of us. - You do know that she has an independent power supply of her own that's in a vault in the basement. - I'm gonna go pull the plug. - That a girl. I'll be right here, don't forget to write. - Unlock door. (ominous music) (buzzing) Staci, unlock door. - [Staci] I'm sorry, Linda, authorization is denied. - Explain "authorization denied." - [Staci] Security Protocol 13 does not recognize retinal scan. - Rusty. (ominous music) (wind howling) - Someone's gonna make a lot of money off this. - What? - Reconstruction. All these buildings and houses. I know because I used to work my father's construction business in Germany. You can make millions off this. - Great. Maybe they can get help! What's going on at the plant? - Eh. Computer problems. You work out a lot? - Yeah, why? - Eh. I was thinking about starting something like that. Linda work out with you? - Sometimes. - Well, maybe we can all work out together sometime. - I don't think so. Look, she's not into you, okay? - I know, I know. One little mistake and the whole world becomes unglued. - I think you've had a few mistakes. Some of them still call the house. - Oh. Well, forget I spoke. - Done. (wind howling) - What, no luck? - Okay, okay. (laughing) We'll get Al to crack the front door, wait for Erik. He'll straighten out this mess. (mechanical humming) (ominous music) Staci. - [Staci] Yes, Linda? - Unlock the door. - Security Protocol 13 requires maximum security for main units code named Rusty and Linda. - Staci, unlock the door, please. - Okay, she's lost it. I don't believe this. Staci, put me through to maintenance. - [Staci] One moment. (phone ringing) - Hey. - Al. - I got me a torch and I was just about to head over there but I can't get out the security door. - You see anybody else walking around in the hall? - No. No, nobody out here, what's going on? - Yeah, we've got a glitch in the computer. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to use that torch to get through the door there and then make your way over to the main computer room. - It's gonna take awhile. - Well you better get started. (ominous music) - [Linda] You know, she nailed me when I tried to call corporate? - The lines are down. - No, Rusty, I'm telling you. She knew I was calling for help and she cut in. - Linda, that's not possible. I mean, if she actually did that it'd mean she'd be capable of reasoning, which she's not. She is a computer. - I think we should put a cover over her lens so she can't see us. - Well, if you believe half od what you just old me, putting a cover over her lens would really piss her off. No? Yes? Maybe? What? - Okay, so how're we gonna do this? - Do what? - We're all locked in. - What do we? (laughing) Oh. (ominous music) Oh, you're really not thinking. - Staci. - [Staci] Yes, Linda? - Give me a schematic of the ventilation system. - [Staci] One moment, please. - I think she can hear us. - What? - Just humor me. - Staci. Can I have a schematic of the cooling system, please? Staci? I don't think she can hear us. - [Linda] Okay, what are those? - Those are security points on the alarm system. - In a ventilation system. Are you gonna be able to get past those? - Me? No, no, no, I'm not going up there, two reasons. One is I don't think it'll support my weight and the other is I'm claustrophobic. Shower stalls, closets, elevators. Freak me out, I mean, freak me out. (ominous music) - Okay. So am I gonna be able to get past those. I mean, is there an override? - No. I mean, if you're really gonna go up there. Look, you see all of these alarms? - Mm-hmm. - They're protecting the pathway up to the reactor. You could be going to the maintenance area. - Right. - Which is, you see that, is in the other direction. The only think I don't know is when that shaft leads to that alarm area, I don't know if the alarm will go off. - Know what happens if it does? - You get vaporized. No, I'm just kidding. The shaft will close in front of you, close behind you. You can't go forward, you can't go backwards. - Right. (ominous music) (gasping) (tires screeching) (wind howling) (whimpering) (horn honking) (groaning) (foreboding music) - Oh, good. - You got it? - Ready? On three. One, two, three. Jump. - Okay. (thudding) Hey. Give me that flashlight. Thanks. (somber music) (horn honking) (groaning) (wind howling) - I gotta check this out! - We're going to the plant, right? - The plant will have to wait. - Let's see, pressing issue at a nuclear power plant or a stalled car on the side of the road? - There's a person in here! Help me get her out! (wind howling) - Oh my God, she's pregnant! We're going there! - Come on, okay? Let's put her in the car. (wind whooshing) - Oh! No. We've got two flat tires. - I only have one spare. Check your phone. (dramatic music) (engine puttering) Damn it! Battery's dead. - You got jumper cables? - No. Anything? - Nothing. - No reception. - Why don't you radio somebody? - The radio's been dead for hours. - You're a policeman. Commandeer a car then! - Yeah, I'll get the next one that passes by! Come on, we gotta get her out of here! It's gonna be dark soon! - I'll get her! (dramatic music) - We might need this. (thunder rumbling) - [Erik] Oh God, here it comes! (thunder rumbling) - There's a house just up the road! - Okay. (dramatic music) (beeping) (humming) - All right, I'm coming up on the first intersection. - Okay, turn right and then you have about another 50 feet to the next turn. How is it up there? - You know, it's a little snug but it's nice. It's cool, you wanna come up? - No. Claustrophobic, remember? - You wimp. - Did you just call me a wimp? (thunder rumbling) (foreboding music) (pregnant woman yelling) - [Susan] You can do it! (pregnant woman groaning) - I can't go anymore. I've got to lay down or I'm gonna die! - [Erik] There! Over there! - Okay, let's get inside and we can take a breather. - Okay, come on, come on. You can make it. (dramatic music) Come on. Just a little farther. A little farther. You can make it. Everything's locked! - Come here and take her! - Okay! Okay! What're you gonna do? - I got a key! (gunshots booming) Come on! Get her inside! (dramatic music) - Okay. Here we go. So when are you due? - Last week. - Yeah, what were you waiting for? - Better weather. - Ah. So do you know, are you having a boy or a girl? - It's a boy. - A baby boy? - Uh huh. - What were you doing out there? - What do you think?! I was trying to get to the hospital! (groaning) Oh, I'm never doing this again! - Are you okay? - It feels like I have a Volkswagen parked in my stomach and it's trying to back up! - Okay, when did the contractions start? - I left contractions behind a couple of hours ago. I'm up to seismic disturbances. - Right. - That last one was a 10 on the Richter scale. - Okay, okay, okay. Oh, this is perfectly normal, right? - You ever have a baby? - Well, no. - Then shut up about normal! (groaning) - Okay, what time did they start? - It doesn't matter what time. - No, no, no, it does matter what time because we are running out of it. - I'm ready to have this baby. - Okay. - I'm sorry to leave you like this but I really have to go to Seaview. (screaming) All right, all right. (screaming) Start breathing. Inhale through your nose and out through your mouth. - Breathing I got. - I don't mean to get personal here, I'm just gonna get some room to work, okay? - Oh, God. I was wrong. It's not a Volkswagen. It's a minivan! - Cervix is fully dilated. - Oh my God, I'm having a baby in a barn! - Okay, let's get this show on the road. What's your name, sweetie, what is it? - Jasmine. - Jasmine, okay. Why don't you... Push, push, don't you think? Isn't that what they say, push? - Yes, doctor, you just say push and the baby pops out. You got that? - The man's crazy! - Aren't they all? Okay, I hate to say this but the baby's coming so just push! - Push, come on! You can do it, push! - I'm gonna need some blankets, thread, scissors. There might be something in the first aid kit. I saw some blankets over there, okay? - I bet you've done this before. You being a police officer and all. - You know what, I'll tell you something. I have shot a man, I've saved three lives but I've never delivered a baby. Okay. Push. (yelling) You got it. (yelling) (thunder rumbling) (ominous music) - Hey, Rusty? Coming up on another intersection. - Right, right. Well this is the one you have to be careful with. Okay, when you get there you turn left. Very carefully. (ominous music) Hold it. Hold it. (alarm buzzing) - What is it, something wrong? (thudding) - Staci has detected a virus. (thudding) - Maybe that's our problem. When she eliminates the virus everything will go back to normal, what do you think? - It's possible. - Yeah. Well, in the meantime, I am stuck up here. - What? What happened? - Yeah, she sealed me off. - All right. Stay calm. Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Rusty? - You detected a virus? What kind is it, please? - [Staci] I am unable to categorize the virus, Rusty. Please stand by. - The location of virus. - The virus has infected the facility's air dispersal system. - Good lord. Linda? - Yeah. Yeah, I got it, she thinks I'm a virus. - Well maybe it's your infectious personality. Standby. Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Rusty? - Virus is nonthreatening. - [Staci] Thank you, Rusty. Virus is isolated. - I say again, virus is non-threatening. Isolation is unnecessary. - [Staci] Security Protocol 13 requires isolation of virus. - All right. I'm going to remove the virus, Staci. - [Staci] Ready for instructions, Rusty. - Good, good. I'm going to need access to the area confinement, please. Staci? - [Staci] Access is denied, Rusty. - [Rusty] Why? - [Staci] Security Protocol 13 requires isolation of virus. Method of destruction being calculated. - Staci, stand down on your method of destruction. Abort! Repeat, abort calculations! (ominous music) Staci! - [Staci] Security Protocol 13 requires virus destruction. (machinery rumbling) - Staci. - [Staci] Yes, Linda? - You're reading me as a virus. You have to let me out of here. - [Staci] I'm sorry, please rephrase. - There is no virus. I'm stuck in the ventilation shaft. I am, as you so lovingly put it, "code named Linda." - [Staci] You are Linda. - Yes. - [Staci] You are a virus. - No, there is no virus. - [Staci] Virus has been detected. Virus is non-categorized. Method of destruction being calculated. - [Linda] Rusty. - You sit tight. You sit tight, I'm gonna get you out of there. - How're you gonna do that? - I don't know. I don't know yet but I'll get you out. Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Rusty? - Let me have the schematic of all the electrical wiring in the facility, please. - [Staci] One moment. - [Linda] Rusty. - Yes, Linda? How may I help you? - That's not funny. - Neither was losing my job. - Rusty, I'm so sorry. That was handled really badly. Rusty? - Yes, dear? - You are the best supervisor I have ever had. And more importantly than that, you are a really good person. You know, a lot of guys would just be tempted to leave me up here, you know? Rusty? Buddy? (groaning) (ominous music) (thunder rumbling) (Jasmine groaning) - Okay. Just give me one more push, okay? (yelling) - Give it one more push! - I don't have one more! (Jasmine screaming) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (somber music) - Rusty! Oh God, I don't believe this. Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Linda? - You wanna flip me over? I think I'm done on this side. - [Staci] I'm sorry, I do not understand. - I notice a definite temperature change. Wanna explain? - [Staci] Virus is organic. Configuration shows vulnerability to increase in temperature. - Give me a temperature reading. - [Staci] Temperature reading in affected area 1-3-5 degrees. - 135 degrees, great. Got the new Hollywood nuclear weight loss diet. Oh God. (groaning) - I am 100 percent sure that whatever problem they're having will not compromise the safety of the people on that island. No, we haven't been able to reach them because of the hurricane. Let me assure you, everything is fine. It was described to us as a minor glitch. That's the plant manager's exact words. Yes, I understand. We have contingency plans for every possible emergency. It's New York, what the hell did you tell them? What? No idea what he said to you but obviously he overstated the case a bit. Yeah, she's here. All right. All right, hold on. - Yes? Henry, how are you? You were out when I called this morning so I talked to your assistant. Well that's just it, we don't know. All right. Worst case scenario, basically, if the cooling system fails then the uranium fuel gets hot enough to melt through the containment and gets down into the ground water and the result is a very powerful steam explosion which could send tons of toxic substances into the air. Conservative estimate? Six or seven million people could die. No. There is no contingency plan for this sort of thing. If it should happen, we would have to suffer the consequences. Yes. Yes, he's still here. (ominous music) - Do you realize what you've done to me? I'm the one that pushed this thing through. You stabbed me in the back. - Well I'm sorry, Bob, but I didn't see anyone take responsibility for what we do here. - Yeah, well it's gonna cost you, Jane. You're out. Get out. Now. (ominous music) Henry. Before you say anything, let me just say that Jane has a tendency to look on the dark side of things. Look, we have nothing to worry about. (alarm buzzing) That plant is completely safe. (groaning) (somber music) (grunting) - Breathe. Breathe. (humming tune) ♪ I'm dreaming ♪ ♪ But I'm steaming ♪ ♪ I have those nuclear ♪ ♪ Meltdown ♪ ♪ Blues ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ - Staci. - [Staci] Yes, Linda? - Why don't you and I go out sometime, huh? Get to know each other. - [Staci] I'm sorry, I do not understand. Please rephrase. - That's a no? Why doesn't anybody like me? - [Rusty] Who are you talking to? - Rusty. What's going on? - Just... (huffing) Just hanging around. How about you? - Oh, you know. Are you gonna get me out of here? - Why should I? - I don't know, because I'm cute. - You took away my job. My bread, my butter. - They gave me the job because I'm smarter than you. - They gave it to you because you're cheap. You're half of what they pay me. (chuckling) - Come on, half. Really? Just because I'm a woman, huh? - No. Always a pay scale based on the hight thing and since I'm taller than you... - Rusty? - [Rusty] What? - I think... (ominous music) - Okay. I'm here. All right. I'm here. I'm here! Oh God. It's hot. Get off me! (huffing) (drill buzzing) Which way? (dramatic music) (buzzing) (groaning) (beeping) Linda? (groaning) (thunder rumbling) - You all right? Jasmine? (pleasant music) - I think he's okay. - My baby. - We did it. Did you? - It wasn't the cleanest job it could've been. (thunder rumbling) Let's get out of here before the roof comes off, okay? - Where are we gonna go? - There's a house about half a mile up the road. If we can make it. (somber music) (thunder rumbling) Come on! I think it's that way! - Keep him covered. (rumbling) (ominous music) - [Rusty] Almost there. - What're you doing? - Entering you in a wet t-shirt contest. What do you think I'm doing? Come on. - How did I get down? - You bailed out at 40 thousand. Drink some of this, you need it. Drink it! Drink it! - You got me down? - I don't remember, did I? Hold that. Let me look. Let me look. - Thank you. - Rule number one, no thanking for help, okay? - I'm good, I'm good. Is Staci still in charge? - Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Rusty? - Crash and burn. - [Staci] I'm sorry, please rephrase command. - No problem, kiss my-- - Staci? - [Staci] Yes, Linda? - Give me a status report. - [Staci] Viruses have been removed from the facility's air dispersal system and are now infecting the main control room. Beginning destruction calculations. - Look at that, you're a fellow virus now. - Yeah, well I came over to the dark side. Staci, give me a report of the main systems function. - [Staci] All main system functions are... - Staci? - [Staci] Cooling systems, negative function. - Negative is not good. - Explain negative function. - [Staci] Standby, please. Cooling system shows negative function in reactor coolant pump. - Damage accessory report reactor cooling pump is not repaired or replaced. - [Staci] If rate of temperature increase is maintained there will be a core meltdown in two hours, 17 minutes and 23 seconds. - Two hours, 17 minutes, 23 seconds. (beeping) - Okay, would you check the reactor coolant pump to specify the malfunction? - [Staci] Yes, Linda, one moment please. - You still want the job? - [Staci] Reactor coolant pump malfunction is located in main circuit board. Secondary resistor unit, negative function. (somber music) - Let me have the schematic, please, on the reactor coolant pump. Main circuit board. - [Staci] One moment. - Right here, right here. Secondary resistor unit is right there. (thunder rumbling) (pounding) (thunder rumbling) - What are you people doing out there? - This woman needs shelter. - Oh my God, it's a baby. - Brand new and under warranty. - Come with me, young lady. - Go get a blanket. - Wait. Thank you. Thank you both. From my heart. - It was wonderful. I've never really experienced anything like it. - I'll come and check on you later, Jasmine, okay? I just need to get this guy to the power plant. Thank you so much. Okay. Let's go. - I'm his uncle. Remember? If you need anything, anything at all, you just call, okay? - I'll remember that. - I don't even know his name. What is it? - Andrew. Andrew Erik Lloyd. - Really? You mean it? - Okay, I thought you were in a hurry? - Yeah. We'll come back. I promise. (thunder rumbling) How far to the plant? - Two miles. - [Erik] Which way? - [Susan] This way. (ominous music) - Still no outside line. - Staci? Maintenance. - [Staci] One moment please. (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) (creaking) - [Rusty] No answer. - It's getting hot in here. - Staci, terminate lockdown. - [Staci] Termination of lockdown requires reboot of backup computer system. - Reboot the backup system. - [Staci] Backup system will reboot after virus destruction. - Main units one and two, code names Linda and Rusty are not viruses, repeat, are not viruses. - [Staci] Correct Linda. Main units one and two must be protected from viruses located in main control room. - Method of destruction? - [Staci] Method of destruction still being calculated, Linda. - It's all right. After complete and total meltdown, she won't bother us anymore. (ominous music) (banging) - You want me to open this door? - Yes, Al! - Al! - It's gonna take awhile. - How long? - I don't know, these are steel security doors. Not as thick as the main entry door. Take a couple hours, at least. - You got one hour, Al. - I'll try. - I hope you're not just standing there, Al. You working? (suspenseful music) (whooshing) (sizzling) (thunder rumbling) - [Susan] Hey! In there! - [Erik] What? (thunder rumbling) - We're in! We're in! We'll just take a breather and then we'll keep going, okay? - Okay. You know, it's funny. Linda's sitting there in the power plant and we're out here delivering babies in the middle of a hurricane. - It's a good story. Maybe we can tall it to her over a drink sometime. - I'd like that. That'd be cool. - You did good today. I'll cut you some slack. (sizzling) (beeping) - [Linda] Oh God. She's turning the heat on. - Like I said, we'll be dead before she kills us. - That'll show her. What do you got? - Trying to shut down the coolant pump. - You know, if we shut down the pump it'll cause the safe guards to shut down the reactor. - I already tried doing that. Security Protocol 13 saw it as an attack. It refused to accept my command. - This is a great piece of equipment, huh? - Yeah, when I get my hands on the guy who designed... Oh, what's his name? Erik. - Rusty! - Erik, that's his name! (sizzling) (thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) - Wait here. (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) Remember I told you about my father's construction company? Like riding a bike! (dramatic music) Come on! I got you! Here we go! (thunder rumbling) Yee-haw! (sizzling) (suspenseful music) - Al? - Tanks are empty. - Okay. All right, all right, what're we gonna do? - Want me to go get another one? - Would you mind? - You know, we're way over my lunch hour, Linda. - Al, if we don't open that door in 45 minutes, we are all gonna die! - What? - Al! Just go get another tank! (suspenseful music) (rumbling) (thunder rumbling) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - Yeah? Erik, where are you? Is Susan with you? She's okay? All right. No, no, there's no way in or out. Rusty, put on the speaker. Listen, we need to know how to shut off Security Protocol 13. - It requires a retinal scan to shut it down. - Yeah, I know but whose eyeball to do we need? - Mine. - Great, might be a little problem with that. We've got a malfunction with the reactor coolant pump. There could be a core meltdown in 33 minutes. (ominous music) - Oh God. Oh God. All right. All right, all right, all right. Okay, we... We may be able to change the value on your retinal scan to match mine. - Okay, how do we do that? - You have to be proficient enough in programming language C plus, plus to understand my instructions, can you do that? - Erik? - Rusty, is that you? - Yeah, yeah, it's me. Look, we're running out of town here, pal. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand that. What you need to do it to hack into the security database and change the values of some of the tables. There's one that's labeled "Iris" underscore "T-B-L." It's an oracle database. You know what I'm talking about? - Yeah, yeah, look, once I muscle my way in, then what do I do? - You need to change the values of your iris scan to match mine. - And you're sure it's gonna work. - Positive. (ominous music) - Rusty, let's go! - Now let me know when you get into that security database and I will start hot-wiring these front doors. (suspenseful music) (beeping) - All right, I'm in! - Good. Now you're looking for "Iris" underscore "T-B-L." (beeping) Yeah. Hold this still. Thanks. - Found it! Found it! - Good. Now listen, if Security Protocol 13 detects any attempt to cheat on the scan, it'll fry your retina. - No. - Are you serious?! - I don't kid about stuff like this! Here. (fizzling) - Erik? - Susan? - Erik! - Lousy piece of junk! I'll rip your guts out! I am gonna kill you! (ominous music) I want that bitch dead! Let's go, Rusty! - Almost there. Almost. (beeping) - We got 13 minutes, Rusty, let's go! (rumbling) - Wake up! Wake up! Help! Somebody help us. Help! (ominous music) - Got it. I got it! - Let's go! Okay, retinal scan activate. - Now. (buzzing) - [Staci] Retinal scan approved. - Oh, yes! - Terminate Security Protocol 13 now. - [Staci] Sorry, voice identification does not match. - No! - No! - [Erik] Shut down Security Protocol 13, Staci. - They're okay. - Shut down Security Protocol 13 now! - [Staci] Security Protocol 13 is terminated. - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (laughing) They got it open! - Al, come on! (suspenseful music) (alarm buzzing) - I'll meet you at the reactor. (alarm buzzing) - I got it! (suspenseful music) - Okay. What? Okay. Okay. Okay. (beeping) (buzzing) - Come on! Come on! Come on! Go! Go! Hey, Rusty! - Need you to help me with this. - Do you know where it goes? - Plug and pay, right? - You plug it in wrong, you'll pay. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. - Good luck. (ominous music) (alarm buzzing) (rumbling) (dramatic music) Come on. Come on. Come on. - [Linda] It's not working. - They're not gonna make it. We're gone. - I'm going in. - No, you can't, that room is full of radiation. - There's no time! Get out of here! (dramatic music) (alarm buzzing) - [Al] I got it. - It's stuck! - I got it! I got it! - [Rusty] Push it. Easy. Easy. Let's go! (dramatic music) - We got her! We got her! - You got it, Al. Let's get you over to decontamination. - I can find my own way there. - Good job. - Go, take care of business. - Well? - I think we're gonna be okay. Let's get over to the office and get a reading. (rumbling) - Susan! - What's going on with the machine? What's happening? What's happening? - [Erik] It's still going up! - [Linda] Oh God! Oh, come on! - [Rusty] It's starting to hold! Come on, baby! - Calm down, sweetheart, let's go, let's go. It's working! Come on! - Let's go! Look! Look! That's it! That's it! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! Somebody get me a beer! (pleasant music) It's over! It's over! - No. It's not over. We need to reboot the backup computer. - Go get her, kid. - Linda? - Unfinished business. (ominous music) (buzzing) - Let's get ready to rumble. - [Staci] I'm sorry, Linda, please rephrase. - I'm taking you down. - [Staci] How may I serve you, Linda? - Yeah, you've done enough. - [Staci] I'm sorry, please re... Warning! Backup power supply malfunction. - Danger, Will Robinson, danger. - [Staci] I'm sorry, please rephrase. - Main unit, code name Linda, is taking you out. - [Staci] Power supply to main computer units is compromised. Fuel cells one through four, negative function. - How about five and six? - [Staci] Main computer unit shutting down all unnecessary functions. - You do that. - [Staci] Maintenance required for main computer unit power supply. - How about this for maintenance? - [Staci] Hello, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Staci. I am the prototype for the NIC-1000 Nuclear Intelligence Control. Please reboot primary function. - I don't think so. - [Staci] Linda? - Yeah. - [Staci] Negative function in primary memory bank. Please reboot. - Say goodnight, Staci. - [Staci] Goodnight, Staci.
