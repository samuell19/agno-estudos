THIS WAS JUST SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. NOTHING SERIOUS. I TOLD HER THAT. I TOLD HER THAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. I WAS COMPLETELY HONEST WITH HER. I WAS, UM... I WAS GETTING DRESSED, AND SHE...SHE STARTS TALKING ABOUT HOW SHE WANTS MORE FROM THIS. SHE'S MADE THIS INTO SOME KIND OF A ROMANCE IN HER HEAD OR SOMETHING. I... OF COURSE, I TELL HER "FORGET IT." SHE WENT CRAZY. SHE GOT UP ON THE BED. SHE STARTED PUNCHING ME WITH HER FISTS AND KICKING ME AND... JUST PUSHED HER... TO GET HER OFF OF ME. JUST...I JUST... I JUST PUSHED HER. AND THAT WAS IT. -BEFORE...WE DO ANYTHING... ARE YOU SURE? ARE YOU REALLY, REALLY SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST CALL THE COPS? -WHAT? YES. YES. GOD DAMN IT. MARVIN, I'M SURE! THIS WOULD RUIN ME! JUST...JUST THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND. I MEAN, JUST THE FACT THAT I WAS SCREWING AROUND WOULD COST ME CLAIRE. SHE'D BE GONE. SHE WOULDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. SEVEN YEARS OF MARRIAGE -- GONE IN AN INSTANT. AND THEN, I MEAN... THERE'S THE WAY THIS LOOKS. YOU KNOW, THERE WOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION, SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY MAYBE, MAYBE EVEN A TRIAL. AND IT WOULDN'T EVEN MATTER IF I WAS CONVICTED. MARRIAGE, CAREER, FINANCIAL SECURITY -- ALL GONE! MARV, THE GIRL WENT CRAZY. SHE DID THIS TO HERSELF, OKAY? I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M COMPLETELY INNOCENT IN ALL THIS, BUT ALL I'M GUILTY OF IS TRYING TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN, AND THEN I'VE GOT TO THROW MY LIFE AWAY BECAUSE OF THIS, BECAUSE OF HER?! MARVIN. TELL ME THAT YOU'LL HELP ME, PLEASE. PLEASE, TELL ME THAT YOU'LL HELP ME. HELP ME, MARVIN. -OF COURSE. OF COURSE, I WILL. OF COURSE. -THANK YOU. -SO, UH, WHAT'S HER DEAL? IS SHE MARRIED, TOO?

SHE'D WALK TO THE END OF HER STREET. I'D PICK HER UP THERE. SHE'D CHECK INTO THE MOTEL. WE WOULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT MOTEL EVERY TIME. STUFF LIKE THAT. -SO, THE ROOM... THAT'S IN HER NAME, NOT YOURS, RIGHT? -YEAH. SHE WOULD PUT IT ON HER CREDIT CARD, AND I WOULD PAY HER BACK IN CASH. -HOW'D YOU TWO MEET? LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WILL CONNECT HER TO YOU. THAT'S ALL. -RIGHT. YEAH. UM...SHE WAITS TABLES AT THIS DINER THAT I GO TO SOMETIMES IF I WORK LATE. WE'VE BEEN SEEN THERE TOGETHER, BUT NOTHING THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED DAMNING. -OKAY. OKAY. I THINK I GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT WE GOT TO DO. BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME STUFF. LET'S GET BACK TO MY PLACE. OKAY. BINGO. WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA NEED THAT. -OKAY. WHAT CAN I DO? -UH, WHAT CAN YOU DO? UH...YOU... CAN GO HOME TO YOUR WIFE. SHE'S GOT TO BE WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU.

WAS HE THE OBVIOUS CHOICE? NO, BUT -- -SPARE ME THE JUSTIFICATIONS. PLEASE. I'M NO STRANGER TO NEPOTISM. IN FACT, I FIND IT USEFUL BECAUSE IT OFTEN COMES WITH BUILT-IN LOYALTY AND TRUST, BUT IT ONLY WORKS IF THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE HIRING CAN ACTUALLY FILL THE POSITION YOU'RE PLACING THEM IN, BECAUSE ULTIMATELY, IT'S YOUR GOOD REPUTATION THAT'S ON THE LINE. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STAND BEHIND THEM -- ALL THE WAY. THIS WAS SO UNCHARACTERISTIC OF YOU. AND THAT'S FORTUNATE, BECAUSE IT HURTS YOUR STANDING LESS THAN IT MIGHT HAVE. -I APPRECIATE THAT.

BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THEY KNEW. Because you fucking threatened me! -[ Chuckling ] THREATENED YOU. SERIOUSLY? YOU KNOW GOD DAMN WELL WHAT YOU DID. -WAIT. HOLD ON. KIP! I-I THINK WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A LITTLE MISCOMMUNICATION GOING ON HERE. -I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK YOU WERE PRETTY CRYSTAL CLEAR. -KIP, YOU ARE GETTING THIS ALL WRONG.

I WANT TO GET OUT OF TOWN FOR A WHILE. I SCHEDULED THAT BASED ON MY CONVENIENCE. FORGIVE ME IF IT INFRINGES ON YOURS. -OH. NO. IT'S NO PROBLEM. SO, UM, IT'S ALL IN THERE, HUH? -YEAH. I NEED A BEER, MARVIN. -YEAH, SURE. I, UH...I COULD USE ONE OF THOSE MYSELF. SORRY IT'S THE MAID'S WEEK OFF. PLUMBER, TOO. GOT A COUPLE BEERS IN HERE, I THINK. THESE TWO WILL BE NICE. [ SIGHS ] AAH! -YOU LIKE THAT, MOTHERFUCKER? YOU LIKE THAT? -OHH! [ SCREAMING ] [ GAGGING ] [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] -WOW. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN PALS THIS LONG? -YEAH. -HUH. AIN'T THAT SOMETHING? I'M READY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH NOW. I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING. -HUH. WELL, I DO LOVE ME SOME CONFESSION, BUT TO BE HONEST, I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO HEAR THIS WHOLE SONG AND DANCE RIGHT NOW. I THINK WE GOT THE BULK OF IT PIECED TOGETHER -- PRIOR TO YOU GOING GINSU ON YOUR PAL IN THERE, OF COURSE. HEY. LOOK. LET'S MAKE THIS EASY, OKAY? YOU FILL IN THE BLANKS FOR ME, AND WE'LL WORRY ABOUT YOUR FORMAL STATEMENT LATER. THAT WORK FOR YOU? -YEAH. SURE. -OKAY, SO, FOR THE RECORD, THIS WAS SELF-DEFENSE, RIGHT? -OF COURSE. -WHEN DID HE BRING OUT THE GUN? -RIGHT IN THERE, IN THE KITCHEN. HE SAID HE WAS GONNA KILL ME. -WELL, I WOULD HOPE THE HELL SO WITH YOU STICKING HIM LIKE THAT. WHY WERE YOU OVER HERE AT SUCH A WEIRD HOUR? -HE CALLED ME. HE SAID HE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT... -ABOUT YOUR WIFE. -YEAH. HOW'D YOU KNOW? -'CAUSE I'M GOOD. THAT'S HOW. -MY WIFE, CLAIRE. SHE'S BEEN MISSING SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST. I CALLED TO FILE A REPORT, AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL SHE'D BEEN GONE TWO DAYS. -STANDARD. BUT...SHE'S NOT THE FIRST WOMAN THAT YOU'VE KNOWN TO GO MISSING RECENTLY, NOW, IS SHE? -THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU. -SO, YOU KNEW GOOD OLD ABBY THE WAITRESS AFTER ALL? I WAS SLEEPING WITH HER. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BEFORE, YOU KNOW, BEING MARRIED AND ALL. -YEAH. WHAT ABOUT YOUR LITTLE, UH, PINCUSHION PAL IN THERE? HOW'D HE KNOW HER? -HE DIDN'T. NOT REALLY. MARVIN'S ALWAYS BEEN THE JEALOUS TYPE, ALWAYS KNOCKING ME DOWN FOR THINGS I HAD THAT HE DIDN'T. -WOW. SOUNDS LIKE A REAL KEEPER. -LAST WEEK HE TOLD ME THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE AFFAIR. HE'D BEEN FOLLOWING ME, AND HE STARTED SHAKING ME DOWN FOR STUFF. -STUFF? LIKE WHAT? -MONEY. HE HAD MY WIFE SET HIM UP WITH A FRIEND OF HERS. HE EVEN HAD ME GIVE HIM A JOB AT MY OFFICE. ALMOST GOT ME FIRED. ALL THAT TIME, I'M TRYING TO CONTACT ABBY, YOU KNOW, BUT SHE'S NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE, SHE'S NOT AT WORK. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS OKAY AND -- AND SEE IF MARVIN WAS BLACKMAILING HER, TOO. -SHE'D GONE MISSING, THOUGH? -YEAH. AND THEN WHEN MY BOSS MADE ME FIRE MARVIN FROM THE JOB I GOT HIM... CLAIRE WENT MISSING, TOO. -COLOR ME SURPRISED. WHAT DID GOOD OLD MARVIN SAY TO YOU THAT HAD YOU SCURRYING OVER HERE? -HE SAID HE KNEW SOMETHING. HE SAID HE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE CLAIRE WAS. -AND WHEN YOU GOT HERE? -HE SAID HE KILLED HER. HE SAID HE KILLED MY CLAIRE. HE SAID HE KILLED ABBY, TOO. I DON'T KNOW. -AND LET ME GUESS -- THAT YOU WERE NEXT. -NO. NO. HE -- HE WANTED MORE MONEY. I TOLD HIM TO GO TO HELL, AND THAT'S WHEN HE PULLED THE GUN. -GOTCHA. AND YOU MADE WITH THE WHOLE PERFORATION DANCE THING. -HE WAS JUST SAYING THAT, RIGHT? HE WOULDN'T HURT CLAIRE. HE WAS JUST TRYING TO SCARE ME. I MEAN, SHE'S JUST MISSING RIGHT NOW. THERE'S STILL A CHANCE, RIGHT? THERE'S STILL A CHANCE. -WE FOUND TWO BODIES IN THE BACKYARD. -NO. -TWO WOMEN. WE STILL HAVE TO DO A POSITIVE I.D., BUT I THINK WE BOTH KNOW WHO THOSE WOMEN ARE. -NO! [ GLASS SHATTERS ] FUCK! [ SOBBING ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] -ONE WOMAN WAS SHOT. THE OTHER WAS BEATEN TO DEATH. WE STILL HAVE TO MATCH THE WEAPONS, BUT I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY WHAT THE RESULTS ARE GONNA BE. SORRY TO BE THE BEARER, COWBOY. -SO, WHAT HAPPENS NOW? WE GO TO THE STATION. WHAT? -NOW? NO. LIKE I SAID, AT SOME POINT, WE'LL GET A FORMAL STATEMENT, BUT NOW YOU GO HOME. NOW YOU GET SOME REST. -THAT'S IT? I'M FREE TO GO? YOU DON'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES? I'M INNOCENT? -WELL, YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE CHARGED WITH ANYTHING, BUT YOU'RE HARDLY INNOCENT, RIGHT? I MEAN, YOU SHOVED YOUR MAN SAUSAGE IN THE WRONG WOMAN, ENDED UP GETTING YOUR WIFE DEAD. NO. NO, YOU HAVEN'T ESCAPED YOUR PUNISHMENT, COWBOY. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR EVERY SINGLE DAY, AND I SUSPECT THAT'S GONNA BE A TALL ORDER FROM HERE ON OUT... UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE ONE SERIOUSLY COLDHEARTED SON OF A BITCH. -SO I CAN GO? -YEAH. YOU CAN GO. I'M SICK OF LOOKING AT YOU. BUT, UH... STAY AVAILABLE, COWBOY. -RIGHT. -MY GOD. YOU COULD SELL ANYTHING TO ANYONE YOU WANTED, COULDN'T YOU? YOU COULD GET SUPERMODELS TO BUY DONUTS. -WHAT AM I GONNA SAY HAPPENED TO HER? -EH, YOU'LL THINK OF SOMETHING. AND NOW YOU GET TO GO AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE, RIGHT? LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. THINK YOU CAN LIVE WITH THIS ONE, TOO? -ONE THING YOU TAUGHT ME TONIGHT -- I CAN LIVE WITH ANYTHING.
