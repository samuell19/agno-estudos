I'm housekeeping, maintenance, security. And, uh, I just make sure that at night, if it don't get done that's... I make sure it gets done in the morning. What I'm doing now is turning the, the, the back part of the lights on. And as I go around, I'm checking the doors for the tenants and making sure that... nobody has gone in. Sometimes, uh, which I'll show you. Sometimes, like the, the shelter wasn't the... Going out the shelter door wasn't locked or whatever, and we'll have, um... We'll have some homeless. There are some, I guess you'd say druggies. But, uh... And then like in the mornings when it's freezing, um... the reason I open up real early is because when it is real cold, sometimes some of the... homeless will come in. And I just, you know, as long as they don't do anything, just to stay warm, I don't, I don't have a problem. Yeah, this whole back end was J.C. Penney's. ...talking about how bad traffic in September is significantly deeper. So you're talking about malls that are going to be ghost towns. That we're not going to go to. And I think that when you see the, these prime J. C. Penney mall businesses. And you say to yourself, "Wow, what would happen if the mall just has, like, blank space, black space, blank space, blank space." You going to go there? Okay. Robin's Nest. Hey, this is Wendy with Southern Company. Hey. I don't know that we can get it to. What funeral home's handling? If visitation is from 10 to 12, the family's probably going to be there at nine o'clock and my delivery person is making deliveries to the, to a church. So I don't think he can get over there in time. David's Florist over there? You can try them. They're close, and they could get it there faster. Okay, I'm sorry. Okay. Bye-bye. Okay. Funeral work, you know, I mean that's the big part of the flower shop. So I've been doing it since day one. And I've been here 25 years, so. And it, it's hard sometimes, especially when it's people that you know. Or it's a family member. You know, I lost my brother about six, seven weeks ago. So when you have to do flowers for family, you know, it, it's harder. It's just all part of it. I don't do as many weddings as I used to do. But as far as fresh bouquets for birthdays and all that, we do. You guys have... You have no idea at all. I hate to say it, but I don't know what it is. But, um... we've had all kinds, but I mean. We've had people poop in the middle of the floor in the bathroom. In the urinal. You know, and, uh... I don't see how. I guess it's just meanness, you know. I don't see how they... can miss a toilet that big, and... hit in the floor, you know? We've had all, I mean. We have a lady that turned a hundred. And, uh... You wouldn't think she was 70 years old. And then we have the regulars. We average about, I'd say we usually get about 30 walkers. In the mornings, all different times. - You doing okay today, sir? - Yes, sir. How you doing, Mike? Good seeing you. How you doing, ma'am? - Good, good. - Sweet. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. And to the republic for which it stands. One nation, under God, indivisible. With liberty, and justice for all. Amen. Alright, guys. Have a good one. We'll see. - Here. - Ten. You ought to be able to count there, you know. Yeah, I would. At least five, anyway. - I'm going to make four. - Oh, okay, that's a good deal. Well, I'll play where I can. There you go. Oh, my goodness, give him a big ten. Double deuce will make you 15 there, sir. Well, I can't score, but I can domino. I get 15. Give the man 15. Have a seat right here. As far as your neckline goes, do we want to keep it like, you said no crazy stuff, just kind of shave it? - Yeah. - Going to put this on so I don't get hair on it. You might have to move back. Alright. My Batman cape. - Are you excited about Luna's birthday? - No. Because I have to go decorate, and get her ready. And bake her a cake. I'm trying to do a fondant, that's not going to work. No, no. Kind of like that I guess, but no designs. Even though the designs are pretty cool. So I'll, like, I'll get you basically what you want from there. Then work around the rest, so. That feels so good. I love it. Do you think the Great Clips is going to mess up MasterCuts any? - Nah. - I didn't think so either. Aw, it feels like a newborn puppy. Oh, it kind of does! Aw. I ki... I miss us hanging out. I know. Hmm. - Yeah, we'll go with that. - You sure? - I mean, I can fix you up if you want to. - Yeah... I guess. Is the arch right in the middle? Yeah. - Yes, ma'am. - God, I have so many wrinkles on my forehead. It's because we get old. We get winkles. Shut up. I'm going to get me a Mello Yello refill real quick. She's going to drain you all. - Huh? - She's going to drain you all. I just want some Mello Yello. Maybe some Coca-Cola. You know? Sir, how are you? - You got one for me? - Yep. You know, listen to this one. Teacher asks Little Johnny... "Johnny, uh... Who, who was the first president?" Johnny stuttered a little bit. He said, "Teacher, you think you know?" She said, "I don't think, I know." He said, "I don't think I know either." Hey, I've got one more. Teacher asks, teacher asks Little Ol' Jim in the class. She said, "Who was the, uh... Who was the first man on earth?" He said, "Oh, it was Cartwright." "Oh, no, no, Jim, it was Adam." He said, "I knew it was one of them Cartwrights." Y'all know this one. It was one of them. I got you, sir. How are you doing this morning, Michael? Sir, I'm doing great. I have no complaints. Well, that's good. This dad gum thing here. I just, uh, it's called a smart phone. Too dad gum smart for me. Well, how are you, sir? Well, I heard, heard that you asked about me, - and I told your husband I was... - Joel? ...going to call you, and tell you good morning. - Hello? - Hello? - This dad gum phone makes me angry. - Hello? See? Can you hear me now? There it goes dialing again. I don't know who it's dialing this time. Hey, pop. I'm sorry, son. I got the wrong number. I'll talk, - talk to you later. - Oh, that's alright, that's alright. You could hear me. It was my phone, not yours. Well actually, Angie, I am doing great. Compared to three months ago when they pronounced me dead. Well, that's the third time I've been pronounced dead. Well, I'm in my 80s. Eventually it's going to be a final. Hey. Well, from what my Bible tells me, uh, and from what I saw my first time I was dead, which I was actually dead that time, I know what Heaven looks like. So, uh... I'm looking forward to it. Okay. $163.50. - Okay. - Thank you. Alrighty, thank you, ma'am. I started coming to this mall in 1982, when it opened. It was the place to be. I mean, every weekend, this mall was crowded. Every day. Well, being a young man back then, that's what we come to the mall for, was to bird-dog girls. And there was plenty around here. This mall was just packed out. Was a beautiful mall at the time. - How are you doing today? - I'm doing good, how are you? I'm doing good, now. It looks good. You did a good job. Well, thank you. Well, it took me, what, a year? - Felt like it. - No. Maybe since October... - That's right. Yeah, that's all. - ...or November. She said you all were moving. Yep, I'll be moving out this weekend. - Okay, well, thank you. - You come see me. - I will. - I appreciate you. Thank you. Yeah, I've been in this mall eight years, and I love this mall. I've fought for this mall, and done everything I can for this mall. But I can't make a living here. Last week I had a $24 day, and I had a $16 day. Um, and you can't live on that. And it's just kept on getting worse and worse. And for a jeweler, it takes one day to have, one customer to have a good day. But with the traffic we have, the chances of that one customer get slim and slim. Slimmer and slimmer. Um... We've heard the rumors. It's every, every week, or the week. Right now, we're hearing Victoria's Secret's coming. But who comes to a mall when stuff is leaving? When there's an exodus going on, who comes in? I mean, I look out my door right now, and you don't see a soul. That's what I look at every day. You look out there more and see nobody out there than you do seeing a crowd of people. It's Fridays and Saturdays, you'll get a little bit of people... but nothing to, nothing substantial. I can fix that. I move out, I can solve that problem. I owned a zoo for 25 years. Lions, tigers. Yep. And you probably see that's my, that was, that's my passion. I've been in the hospital 22 times, and I went in the pen with everything. They were my kids, and, uh, my wife said, "Look." She would just increase the life insurance policy on me. And she said, "Listen, you know, you need... might want to slow down." A baboon ripped that tendon and nerve out for me. Here. Buffalo horned me right there. Uh, a mountain lion. Right there. Just... You know, normal stuff. Yes. Okay. It's just started? Oh, no worries, we'll get on it. No, see, because, you know, last night, nobody was, uh, using it, or anything. So what I'll do is... Okay, I'll get it checked out for you. Alright. Yes. I know, ASAP. We'll get on it. Thank you. I'm going to talk to this kid right quick. And then, uh, I'll get on that, okay? I'll check that out. Hey, what's going on? What are you applying for? Uh, just the sales. - Through what store? - For Factory Connection, yes, sir. Oh, so you're applying for a job for Factory Connection? Yes, sir, in the mall. - Oh. Are you wanting a job with the mall? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Um. Like for housekeeping, or. - Um... - I know Factory Connection, but. Yes, sir. Uh, just what, whatever's available. I'm going to let you fill that out for me. Oh. Tell me, you know, when you can work. If I said, "Hey, look, you got to go take a drug test." - Could you pass it? - Yes, sir. Okay. Reason why I was saying housekeeping, we are trying to hire somebody for housekeeping. - Yes, sir. - And that's pretty much, we say housekeeping, but, it's, uh, you know, making sure the mall's cleaned up, I mean, the trash is picked up, um, just. It's nothing strenuous or anything like that, it's just to make sure the mall's up to par. We do go around with a broom and dustpan, which everything is out here, and I'll show you. I'm just showing you that, that way if you think you might want to do it - you're welcome to it. - Yeah. Alright. We have 25 garbage cans in this mall. - Twenty-five. - Twenty. 25. Five are outside the mall. - Three in the front. There's one around one side. - Yeah. But there is 25. And when I, here's what I do. When I tell them to check, like this one has got, it's got Coke and stuff in it, so we empty it. But the other times I tell them, if it's halfway full, empty it, you know? If not, and you don't have to empty them, we empty them at night. - Right. - At 7:00, okay? So. - But I'm just, I'm just going over stuff. - Yeah. But like here, we go around. We have a broom, dustpan, you know, - and we have all that stuff here. - Yeah. But if you see it, and like I tell them, like I tell security. If you're going around this, and somebody drops a cup or whatever, pick it up and throw it away. Don't wait on it for you. - Yeah, perfect. - We're a team player here, okay? - Got to work as a team. -Right. When I say clean the bathrooms, it means the glass, - it means the heater. Yes. - Everything? Perfect. It means make sure the tissues are full. - The urinal. Now. - Mm-hmm. I'm going to give you an example. Last week, uh... Somebody decided they didn't want to use the bathroom, they just decided to poop on the floor. - Really? - Yeah, I'm just being straightforward. - That's crazy. - I know. But what I'm getting at is, if you come in here and see a pile of poo on the floor, um, your job is to clean it. - Yeah. - Okay? Uh. You'd be surprised how many run and go get me. - Mm-hmm. - Because they're going, "Look, some, what do I do?" You clean it up. The ladies is, they only have two stalls in it. But we always check. Security, anybody in here? - You always, it's the ladies room, make sure they know. - Yes. That way you're not getting in trouble. - And then we do have signs we put out there. - Mm-hmm. But I'm just showing you that, you know, what. Like this, I'm fixing to paint these walls in here, okay? Somebody got fu... Happy with a magic marker, and just like in there, you see that crap, we're fixing to fix it. Well, what do you think? - Sounds good to me. - You sure? - Yes, sir. - Alright, then I'll give you another application. Now, this, this, this job starts off at $8 an hour. Sales are down just a little bit. But it's not been that bad for me, because most of mine's on the phone anyway. Except for holidays and the gift items, but as far as the flowers, fresh, uh, that's phone orders. So that hasn't really changed that much. And then decoration, you know, is our seal. So that's helped keep our sales up. This is August 5th, 1981. I can't believe all those cars. - It was packed out. - Yeah, it was packed. All the way around there, - wasn't it? - Yeah. There used to be a toy store. Yeah, it was, uh. And Chick-fil-A. Was it, KB Toys, right? - Is that right? - Mm-hmm, yeah. See, you've got stuff like Miss Alabama, fashion show, stuff like that. It's pretty cool. - As The World Turns. Yeah, - the actress from As The World Turns. Oh, my goodness. Okay, but I'll let you all look through that. I mean, it was just back there. - I'm gonna look. - In the back, in the filing cabinet, so. This is '89. Oh, now he had, James Davidson, he used to have a Christmas store. He'd just set up every year, just a Christmas store. James Davidson, a math teacher at Walker High School. He wore a ugly tie in the ugly tie contest. Held at the Jasper Mall over the weekend. For his first place finish, Davidson won a VCR. Oh, I know him! I think that's Frank Watts. He was a, a teacher. But he did the powerlifting. Oh, looky here. Look at that fashion contest. I'd like to open my own salon. That's what I'd like to do. It'd be like, I want to open a salon and tattoo shop together. That'd be, oh, my God, the rocker theme? - You could have a motorcycle parked in there? I just want to leave Jasper. - Like, I love it here. Everybody knows everybody here. - Everybody here. - Yes! - But when you go to places like New York, you're just so out in this big, here's a fish bowl. It's a fricking ocean. Like you're just out in this ocean just, what do I do? I'm just trying to move up I just want to hurry up and be a manager as quickly as I can, make really good money, get a nice house, and just go on with my life. Maybe settle down, - have a kid or two. - I've learned to like, like, go with the flow. I worried so much about putting a lot of things into perspective really fast. Like getting married, having kids really fast. And I, I do, I love, I love my daughter. Well, that's the thing to do. You got to get married, have kids. You got to do all this and that. You don't want to be one of the leftover women in this town. - But you realize how small this place is. - Yeah. And, like, it kind of puts a little bug in you. Like, okay, what's next? Like, I like this small town, and I like this, the comfort of it. But there's something bigger out there. - Yeah. - There's something way bigger out there. I just want to, like, I just want to leave my mark on the world. Like, just leave my mark, like just a little stain. Leave a skidmark. Pretty much. Like, that's how I want to be, yeah. -I left a skid mark on the U.S. It's nice out tonight. I'm trying to get some stuff going on. We're going to have, start having a once a month car show outside. And we're going to have a quartet, and, uh, they're going to come out, like at 12, we're going to put it, um, where the mall, uh, where the, uh, food court is. We're going to put a stage out there for them and stuff. And, um, it's just to br... Bring the locals out here. Or anybody, really. Alright, good afternoon, everybody, and welcome back to the Jasper Mall! Walker County Quartet Convention. They did a great thing, come on. Oh, yeah. Good to see each and every one of you here, and, uh, I know this, this mic is bassy, but that's okay. We're fixing to get a guy on here who can make it sound good, too. This is a annual event that we usually have here. Southern gospel music and bluegrass gospel. The mall is an excellent place. It's a public place, of course, and where people of various, uh, backgrounds and everything comes through here. So we just minister to them as they walk by, shopping from one place, store to the other. They come by and listen to some gospel music, go on their way, shop some more, come back through. And we'll be here, uh, probably 'til around six o'clock this, this evening. Now this is where the old K-Mart used to be. It's a good-sized building right here. But like I said, this, this is 84. I'm going to shut this door right here. This is 84,500 square feet. Sir, you doing good? Doing great, thank you. But this is a big building. And we're trying to find, we're trying to get something else to go back in here. They had everything in here. We just have to, you know, we have to come in and check it and make sure that's, nobody has broke a window or the, or door, or the glass on the outside. And they just, they just turned the power off here. I believe this was a customer service booth. And, uh... Heck, we could use it now, couldn't we? But this, I mean, when they would come in, they would come here first, you know. But this right here is the booth. Because they did, they had, look, there's still. Still got the phone here. My wife, her company, they were over this mall. And then she got transferred. And I was coming through, I was. I was bringing tigers to a zoo. And, I stopped by here to see her, and, I, um, I'd come through when I was moving animals and stuff. And I stopped by and started, started coming in and, uh, spending some time with her and stuff, and. And then, um, the owner offered me a job, and I said, "Well, okay." So I've been doing it. Look at this. Well, some people believe in ghosts. Attention K-Mart shoppers. We would like to bring to your attention our prescription department... ...going to make bells ring for you. Get a General Electric portable phone. But don't wait too long. This sale ends Saturday. Thank you for shopping our K-Mart. That's disgusting. You know, I think when most people come to this mall, that they think it's already ran down. Especially teenagers that, they don't think they really have to do anything... to help keep it getting any worse. I work at Shoe Department, Belk, and I work for the mall. And none of them are a bad job, I really enjoy working inside the mall. Uh... Most people wou... wouldn't think that working in the mall. But the people who work here are very friendly. Some of the men that come into the mall in the mornings are a little bit perverted. They... Like I had for instance this one man came up and was having a conversation with me, and he said that all Mike does is sit in the office and watch porn, and didn't do his job. Well, I was cleaning the glass in the front of the store, and he comes up by, back by, and he's apologizing and saying, "I'm sorry if that offended you." And I'm just like, "No, that didn't offend me." Well, then he goes on to say, uh... to invite me to watch porn with him. So he didn't say that Mike sits in the office and watch porn, he had said, or he had asked me to watch porn with him. Most of my friend group, we work a lot. But, like, me and my friend has two cruises booked. Uh, we do a lot of things outside of school, but we do it with a bunch of school friends. We do it together as a group. Uh, we went to Florida not too long ago, uh. We have been to New Orleans together. We've been to Washington D.C. together. And I've been on three cruises. I've constantly got to be going somewhere. I'm constantly moving around. I'm constantly traveling. If a store asks me to go to another store, I, I'm going to go to another scor... store. No matter what the pay is, just because I like going different places. Uh, I don't like to be in one place at one time. Not because I don't like Jasper. It's just, I like to see new things, and do different things. Well, about all I can do... is this. Another two, deuce. Well, the one is a spinner. I had to play something. Sure is. Bobby made me play it, didn't he? - I tell you what. - He sort of twisted your arm, didn't he? I ain't going to play. - You're not? - No. Samantha, how are you? We're going to introduce you guys to physical fitness. We're going to give you that taste of dedication and stuff - that it takes to get in shape... - Mm-hmm. ...uh, before basic combat training, so. - Okay. - So, we will push this stuff out of the way. Get started with some uh, some good ol' stretching. So, alright, first thing's first, just take your left leg. Alright, place it forward. And you're going to push back on that right leg. Okay? You're going to get that nice good calf stretch in, okay? And stretch it out. Alright, we're just going to go straight into it, okay? So, it's just going to be a series of things. I'll keep time. 25 crunches, okay? 25. Control that breathing, alright? Get that breathing rhythm down. You guys come on over here. It's just going to be lunges. So, nice and easy, okay? Make sure not to bang your kneecap off the ground. Good. Good job. Nice and easy, okay? There we go. Alright, finish strong, girl. Finish strong. Get it! Stand up nice and tall, bro. There you go. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Hey, we'll take a couple minutes, then we'll hit round two, okay? - What's round two? - Same stuff. You okay? - How you feeling? You okay? Okay, alright. You're just going to get down, just like this. Alright, we're going to go for a minute of planks, okay? Uh, not your typical planks on the elbows, okay? So, it's just going to be, well, we call it the front leaning rest position, okay? So just follow me for the allotted time, okay? Get that back straight. Keep going, keep going. And, relax. Good job. Great job. Alright, you ready? Another lap. Q, you're going to sit this one out, alright? Okay? Alright? Get that breathing back under control, bud. The carnival, um, it's going to be here ten days. And we're hoping it's just going to start bringing a lot of, um, you know, locals, uh, and, well, the whole county. We're hoping it's just going to start bringing in for, um, for the mall. And, um, you know, uh, it'll benefit the carnival and it'll benefit this mall. And that's, that's, what we're hoping we're going to do, is, uh, just start, well, it's like we've got a sign out, you know, we want everybody to come, everybody to have fun. And that way they can shop, and, um... and all the tenants, the, the, the spaces in the mall. And then, um, they can come out here and have fun and shop, come back. Keep shopping and have a lot of fun. But it'll be here for, you know, 'til the 21st. So we want everybody to come out and just have a good time. I love the fair. Oh! Yeah, and so many people learn the hard way. You do not play their games. No. Lauren lost $460 dollars - on it. - I know. I need two armbands. -I'll help. - Can I see your right hand? - Look, other hand. There you go. Alright, my turn. Hey. I want a funnel cake with the sprinkles on it. And then a Sprite. - You want it small or large? - Um. Small. We come in all shapes and sizes. Hey. I guess we'll fish. Because they keep on playing that song, - so I guess we're fishing. - We're, you'd better win me a fish. - Huh? - Win me a fish. Uh. Thank you. I don't want to drop it. This thing good, for real. I know, the sprinkles go with it. You remember Homecoming? The ones that we had? And they had, like, strawberries. Yeah. Hers were alright, but this. This is better than that. This thing top. The strawberries sound good. - Come on. Hurry! - Come on. -Come on! We'll hurry. Yeah. Yay, yay, yay! Thank you. Are you ready? Yeah! - I'm not ready. - It's okay. It's not scary at all. I'm right here with you. - It's too scary! - It's okay. It's okay to be scared. That's okay. Look, look, nothing bad's going to happen. - Look. - How do I get down? Put your arm right here. No! I got you! I got you. - Put your arm right here and hang on. - No! - It's okay. Look. - Get me off! -Look, just stay right here. It's okay. It's going to be super fun. I don't want to ride this! It's going to be like riding a real pony. - I don't want to! - You ready? - You ready? - No! Baby! I want to get down! -Looky here! I got you! -Woo-hoo! - Here we go! - I don't want to going to die! -Oh, my gosh. You're doing so good! I don't want to going to die! Oh, my gosh. Luna, it's okay! - Going to die! - I've got you! - Look. - I want to get down! You wanted so bad. - I want to go! - See? It's okay! It's a fish. Oh, ha, ha! I got one! Finally. Who's calling me? Hey, I'm busy, I can't, I can't come, okay? Alright, well I love you, you have fun, okay? Do good. Bye. Hey! Two one. I was, I'm the DJ, I'm the DJ in Jasper, Jasper, Alabama. We could rap about school. Ay, we about to graduate. Graduate! And then we're going to eat cake. Cake? What? Graduate, eat cake. This is not our birthday. I know I'm going to go on it. I know I am. I feel it. I don't know, you said it was too loud. Well, that, you know you heard me. "I'm going to die." What, the fireball was too loud or something? - I guess. - With all the rattling. It might even fall off. No! I'm just playing! I'm just playing. I'm just. - You're giving me an anxiety attack. - No, no! What, what? Oh, we're going to stop. We are not stopping. What are you talking about? His cousin and me has been best friends since 9th grade. And in 10th grade, his cousin's little sister was like, "You should follow this dude on Instagram." And I said, "Okay." And I thought he was so cute. Then I was like, waiting for him to post something for me to like, and he posted a "to be honest," I was like. And he, then he, uh, then he liked my "to be honest," so I was like, "To be honest, you cool, but I don't know you." And then we just started from there. And we had a girl message me and say, "Are you all talking?" And I was like, "No." So I texted him and said, "Are you talking about me?" And he said "No." And then gave me his number. - We started dating about a month after that. You always have some old people that kind of looks at you like, "You all aren't supposed to do that." And I have a lady that married one of my cousins, and she was really against it. And she told me right away, she was like, "You're going to go to hell for it." And started preaching the Bible to me. So I asked my preacher, and I was like, "Is it really going to be an issue?" And I'm crying, I was really upset, because I really liked him and that to be the very beginning. And he said, "Well." He said, "Everybody's going to be against it." And really it's not even about interracial in the Bible and stuff. So he explained it to me and ever since then you hadn't really had that many issues. You have some people question you, but you just say you don't see color. My mom, she used to say I was crazy for trying to date a white girl at the time. But then when she actually, like, got to sit down with her and talk to her and stuff, she fell in love with her. Still love her to this day. Like a bear. Hey, Merry Christmas! Hmm?

Can you not see the way, way his eyes is turning. He's getting mad now. You watch him. He speaks with forked tongues. See, watch his mouth. - What you want for Christmas? - I want, um.

It goes around and round in a circle. Okay. Yes, and it goes, it goes round and round in circles. Alright, it goes right, right around in circles. - Okay, I think she's ready. - You ready, buddy? You ready? You ready? Big smile. Let me see those pretty teeth. - Say cheese! - Cheese. Hey! Bye bye! Bye bye! - Somebody can do a lot of damage with one of these. - I guarantee you. That one there is, that's a Condor, made by Condor. - Looks like a Rambo knife. - It does. - Thing's huge. - That's a, uh, that's a very large knife. I'm not sure exactly what that one is... called, it's called a Jungle Bowie. What are those, fillet knives right there? It is, yeah. That's an old Henry fillet. That one runs 24. - I think that thing would be sharp. - Yeah. - You got any more fillet knives? - That is it. That's all I've got in, in at the moment. And what about throwing knives? These three are going to be throwing, and then everything across the front right there is going to be throwing. These right here, those are throwing as well? Those right there are actually called just push, push knives. Okay. Like, that's why it's got the grip on it like that? That's right. Yep. This right here, that's going to be your standard throwing knife. And see, you couldn't buy these. I mean, they don't sell throwing knives at, - like, Walmart and stuff, do they? - No, no. Most of the time, now, most of the time, you're going to have to use like, uh, you know, purchase them from a sporting goods store, or something - of that nature. - Right, right. I could see how that would be easy to throw. Yeah. There's a, there's like bunch of people that, that, that use and play around with throwing knives as well. I was kind of shocked when we got out here. Bunch of people's already bought them? - Bought them some? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - From kids to adults. - Those are throwing knives as well? That's a throwing knife as well. - Good lord. - That's just a single thrower. Wow. Yep. You know what you want for Christmas? What you want for Christmas? - A toy. - Huh? I want a drone. I want a remote control truck. - Yeah. - I want LEGOs. - Alright. - I want... Ah... Is that four? I don't know. Cheese! I see, I see what you're talking 'about. I'm going to deliver those poinsettias. Okay. Alright, be careful. Robin's Nest. Mm-hmm. No, actually, uh, we're going to close. We are going to retire. So at the end of this month, yeah, I'm sorry. So you'll just have to check. Well, thanks. Uh, there's five or six other shops in Jasper, so, you know, if you want to give one of them a call. But I appreciate you calling, and checking with us. Well, we just decided we'd retire, so that we could travel and do other things, so. We've been, we've been here 25 years. So, so it's time. Okay. Well, thanks for calling, and good luck on your wedding. Okay, thank you. Bye bye. Thank you, you too. Hey, Angelie, this is Mike. Jasper Mall. I'm doing great, how are you? Sweet. No, no worries. Listen, I got your email. What I was going... Um, I have a few, um, empty spaces. But one of the reasons why I was calling you today is, um, the two, uh, food spaces that we have, the, um. We had a Grady's that was like, um, sandwiches and stuff like that. He had got out, um, like two weeks ago. And then we just had Subway, um. Got out yesterday. And I got it with Mike Cohen. I just told him, we need something in this mall, um. And I've been calling, um, the locals. I'm not from here. But I've been calling the locals trying to at least get, you know, something. So I guess I'm calling you for help. Please. Anything. I mean, uh, because now the, uh, the tenants are saying, "Look, you know, we don't really have anything to, to eat." You know, they don't want to keep going places. But. Our two anchors? We don't have the two anchor stores. Um, it was K-Mart and Penney's, which, you know, they got out everywhere. Belk is the only anchor we have right now. Okay, um... And I can tell you how many. Let's see, we got Penney's, K-Mart. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. We've got eight empty spaces. In the mall. Yes. So like I said, we do desperately need, you know, um, some food joints. At least for a start. It's a, it's, I mean, it's a good little town. Uh. We just got to get some more support for the mall, you know? We got to get everybody to start. Um, I know the, uh... The city's trying to get a lot of people going down... you know, downtown. They're trying to bring it up and everything. But we're trying to get this mall up, up again. And we got a good, uh. We're hoping next month that, uh, somebody might be coming in the K-Mart building. So that'd be good. They, uh, they hadn't committed to it yet, but they're, they're in, they're in the works, and they're talking about it, so that'd be good. That'll help out a great deal. You'd be surprised how many people that tell us everyday how they feel safe, come up here and walk and, uh, they tell me they remember when it opened up the first day here. Some of them still coming. So that's a, that's a good thing. But I wish it was like it, you know, when they said it first opened up, there was, they said you couldn't even walk in the mall there were so many people in here. So maybe if something opens back up we'll, we'll get them in here. It'd be nice. Sure would. Are you retiring? Yes, ma'am. Oh, I hate this! I know. Me too. Are you excited? Yeah, I'm, you know, - sad too. Yeah. - Too. Well, you're a fixture here. Yeah. Well, I'm going to miss everybody. That's for sure. I have this blown up and putting it. That's me and him. - Actually wearing the same shirt. - Aw, yeah. - So we'll put that in there and give it to him. - Well. And that's your son? I'm 55. Well, you don't look old enough to have a son. - How old's he? - Oh, he's 24. - I have a 28-year-old too. - Oh, my goodness. Okay. Well, alrighty. Thank you so much for shopping with us. - Over the years. - Thank you. I appreciate it. As of two weeks ago, I got officially accepted to West Alabama. And then I'm going for athletic training program there. So I'll get to work with all the athletes. And then that'll be my future. Me and Isadore, we dated for, like, ever. We eventually broke up. We was trying to get back together from the last time we hung out. He ended up dating a girl at my school. And, we go to two different schools, so it was easier to forget about him. But then he started dating a girl there. So it made it hard. I fell in love with him. He was my first kiss. So I loved him. Isadore told me that he was going to go for a couple months to his brother up in Ohio, and do some kind of landscaping job or whatever. At this point, since I am going almost two, three hours away I don't know if we need to keep trying or whatever. I think eventually you grow over high school. These are ligers, and, um, big cats. It's a male lion bred a female tiger. Look how beautiful that tiger is. That's Tabitha. That's Henry the camel there. I had grizzlies. I had black bears. I had grizzly bears would take marshmallows out of my mouth. But these all were my babies. And I just wanted everybody to have a good time and enjoy themselves at my, at my facility. These activists would come out, and didn't think an animal should be in a cage. Um, videoed, uh, I guess you'd say videoed me. And, um, I guess I didn't say some things they were too fond of. And, um, next thing I knew, I got in trouble. And, uh, I, um... I ended up closing it. It wouldn't, it's just not worth it. Uh. Mm mm. Just thinking about it makes me sick. See, I still have my place. I just, it's just so depressing going back and just seeing all the, all the empty cages. But when you do that so long and they're your kids. Yep. But, you know, that's why, I mean, I took this job, and, it, um, it gets me out and about. Get to see people and talk to them, and. I tell everybody at this mall, I'm always joking with them: I left a zoo, now I'm in a jungle. But they like to joke with me, so it's all good. Took the sign down yesterday. To me, that sort of makes it official. Been a lot of people come by today, tell us they're going to miss us. And we're going to miss them too. Some of them you just think of them as family they're up here so much. Brenda said, "She didn't tell me!" That's what I said. That's just exactly what I said, Robin. I said you didn't tell me that you was. Last time we's in here chit-chatting. We probably hadn't made up our mind yet. - Well, let's go, Brenda. - You all have a good job. - Bye. - Bye bye. Hey, I hate it that, that. If Belk's goes, and my Bath and Body goes, we're going to be in deep woo woo. Excuse me. Cut that out, okay? Cut out what I just said. - Bye. - Bye. Okay, there you go. - I got accepted to West Alabama. - Man. I cried. When I, I got my ACT to 18, and you know I needed a 17. - Yeah. - And so, I cried. And then when it was official, I was in the middle of class, and I just stopped. I just got, I just went to the bathroom, and I was just crying. - I was so happy. - Yeah. University of West Alabama. - Who's that? - Mr. Stephen. - The guy in the station over there. - Oh, yeah. I don't see the, I don't see his full body. He's always behind the counter. I leave May 26th. To Ohio? I'll be down there for a while. Just be careful. I feel like you're going to do something. Get in trouble. I'm going to have to fly up to Ohio. I'm be up there for a good minute. When you coming back? Mom said I can come back whenever. I ain't going to miss it. I'm just going to miss my homeboys, for real though. - Ain't go, ain't going to miss me at all? - Nope. Mm mm. Thanks. Just, pinky promise you'll be safe? I'm going to be safe. And if something happens, you're going to call me? If you need me? What? How you going to help? - You like, how many hours away? - I could fly down there. - Right, right. - Or I can send you money. Bro, I could get shot. And you know how long it'd take you to get down there? - Trust me. - I could be dead by then. - I'll drive the plane. - Drive the plane? Yeah, put extra gas in it. Extra gas? I'm sorry, Kasey, but you're going to crash that plane. - You're going to crash it. - Hospital together! - This is not GTA 5. - Samesies! This is not GTA 5. Oh, I'll miss you. Growing up sucks. And this is, uh, 60, 64,000 square feet. Penney's is. Well, see look at the, where my, my wife's in Centerville now. Georgia. Um, they still have a Penney's. It's still open. They said it, you know, it's going to close pretty soon. But all of them are. But, um, hers is still open. So that tells you where there... Where her location is, um, was really, is really doing very well. If this mall closed, I would do something. I mean, that's, uh, that's all I could tell you. I mean, life's too short. I'd, uh, but I would, um. I would probably, I could go work at another mall for, for, for this, this, the owner of this mall. He's got, you know, um, he's got 30 something malls. I'm sure I could be a, uh, benefit to him. Quiet in here, isn't it? You all doing good? - Thank you. - Have a good night. You too, honey. You guys have a good night. And be safe. They told you one of my domino players passed away, didn't they? You know, the one that had the oxygen? Yep. He got put in the hospital, and then, uh. They thought he was doing, you know, they thought he was doing better. Passed away. And then they quit coming for about three weeks. And, uh. So we finally got them to start coming back. They just said it wasn't the same, you know. Without him playing. But, they're doing, they got another player now, so... they're doing good.
