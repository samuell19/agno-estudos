(WOLVES HOWLING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Quines? It's Pat Garrett. Come on in, Pat. (GUN FIRING) May the Lord have mercy on you, Mr. Garrett. I baptized Billy and now I buried him. Yes, he was an outlaw and a sinner. But you were his friend. He trusted you. Who's really buried in that grave, Pat? No one will ever know. You should have been at least a hundred miles away from here by this time. A man doesn't get to attend his own funeral very often. Well, you stick around here long enough for somebody to see you and you'll be attending mine. Well... I won't be needing these any longer, Pat. Remember, that's a promise. I told you I'd hang 'em up. I meant it. From now on, I'm going to be busy working that homestead you gave me. Maybe I'll turn out to be a real good dirt farmer. And Billy, don't let anything change your mind about this. (WHISTLING) (WHISTLING) (WHISTLING) (WHISTLING) (GRUNTING) (YELPING) (GUN FIRING) Ain't like the emporium back in Dodge City, but the meat's fresher. My name is Slade. Jack Slade. I'm Bill Antrim. How come you travel around without guns? Guns are for those who want to use them. I don't. Kinda stupid, if you ask me. Nobody asked you. Cocky little rooster, ain't ya? If I didn't owe you a favor... The Jack Slade I heard about wouldn't let a little thing like that stop him. Maybe you didn't understand. I'm the Jack Slade that out-shot Cherokee Bill, Ace Jardine, Wes Hardin and a lot of others. Now I'm going to run Billy the Kid into a hole. You're too late. He's already in one. Six foot long and six foot deep. You're joking. Nobody would have gunned him. Except maybe me. Did he get it in the back? Pat Garrett caught him off guard last week in Fort Sumner. The Kid never had a chance. They'll never get me that way. Now I'll never be able to prove I could beat him to the draw. What difference does it make? He's dead. What difference? Do you know what it means to have a reputation like mine? You gotta be the best and meet the best, or nobody's going to hire you. I've had it thrown in my teeth that Billy could outshoot me. I'd been trailing him for two years to prove it's a lie. Two years. Lincoln, Willow Springs, Santa Fe, La Mesilla. Always missed him. (SIGHS) I've got a good mind to gun that Pat Garrett. It was a lousy trick! Sorry I brought you the bad news, Slade. Well, as soon as I have the grub, I'll be on my way. Which way are you headin'? Territory around Four Corners. Well, I'm going to farm me a piece of land. Might as well ride along with you. Nothing to keep me here in New Mexico. Your choice, Mr. McCloud. I guess it doesn't make much difference, Colonel Morgan. Thirty duels for you, isn't it? That's right. Do you wish to retract those statements you made about me in your newspaper? There'll be no retractions. All right, Matt. Now take your places, back to back. Start walking as I count. When I reach ten, turn and fire. One, two, three, four, five, six seven, eight, nine, ten. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) When the Bugle comes out again, Colonel Morgan, we'll call this by its right name. Murder. I let your father fire the first shot. He had more than an even chance. Did he? He was a newspaper editor, not a gunman. Then he shouldn't have written the things he did about me. I gave him fair warning. I intend to carry on my father's fight. The Bugle will print the truth about you or anyone else who tries to stop this territory from being annexed to the State of Texas. The people here have a right to vote as they see fit. Miss Ellie, I want you to understand one thing. No other state would claim this territory until I pioneered it. This was an empty wilderness, and now it's rich because I made it that way. Every steer out on that range is there because I put it there. My sweat, my money, the best part of my life has gone into making this territory rich. Now that it's built, if Texas thinks she can take it away from me by asking a lot of stupid yokels to just vote it away, she's wrong. This is an empire. My empire. And I intend to keep it that way. An empire for your killers and your outlaws. Good day, Miss Ellie. I'll take care of things for you, ma'am. (SOBS) Couple of you men help me carry this body over to the funeral parlor. Nobody touches Matt till I say so. Then say so. The kid's not armed, Jardine. Besides, he's a friend of mine. Well, Jack Slade. It's been a long time. Yeah. Not since Dodge City. You were going to plug me in the back, but I was too fast for you. I'm still carrying your slug under a rib. But that's the way it goes. We were on different sides of the fence then. No hard feelings now though, uh, is there, Slade? No hard feelings. This is Bill Antrim. Bill, meet Ace Jardine. Hiya. All right, you two, go ahead. Since you're a friend of Slade's, I'll tip you off to something. Don't side in with Ellie McCloud. Look, mister, I happen to believe kinfolk have a right to their dead. That doesn't mean I'm choosing sides. I'm not interested in your fight. Just keep it that way. Colonel Jeff is hiring gun hands, Slade. Pays top wages, too. You going to be around, why don't you look him up? It's an idea. You're a hard one to figure, Bill. How come you went up against Jardine without a gun? He'd as soon shoot you as look at you. Didn't stop to think, I guess. A bad habit of mine. Hey, look at this. (READING) That settles it. I'm backing the Colonel. I suppose you'll be heading out towards your homestead? Mmm-hmm. As soon as I can buy a wagon and some supplies. Probably take me a couple of days. Well, see you around. Oh, uh, about that habit of yours. Better break it or buy a gun. The Colonel ain't gonna sit still for this, Ellie. Why don't you tone it down a little? It's the truth and we'll publish it, Ben. I'm with you, you know that. I don't want to see you get hurt. (DOOR OPENS) Morning, ma'am. I'd been hoping I'd see you again, Mr. Antrim. To tell you how much I appreciate what you did the other day. I'm sorry you had trouble with Ace Jardine. Don't worry about it, ma'am. I'm, uh, I'm trying to locate the Garrett Homestead. I own it. But nobody in town seems to want to give me any information. Maybe they're afraid to. Why? Just afraid, that's all. Don't want to get involved. I'll tell you why. Some of Colonel Morgan's men are living up there. He took the place over a few years back. It's been deserted so long, I guess they figured nobody wanted it. They'll move. By golly, that wouldn't surprise me at all. Seeing as how you own a ranch around here, you should be interested in the election. I'm not. But you can't stay on the fence. You'll have to side one way or the other. I just want to be let alone. Now, how about giving me the directions. I'll do better than that. Come on around and I'll show you the map. Much obliged, ma'am. Jericho, it can't be. We buried him. I've got to get to Pat Garrett. Jericho, wait. If Billy's alive, Pat Garrett knows it. What? Pat was Billy's friend. He knew him like he was his own son. He might have killed the wrong man, but he certainly couldn't have buried the wrong man. But that means Pat Garrett is guilty of aiding an outlaw. Well, so were you, once. Yes, I helped that boy once. But I'm never going to do that again. You might be making a bigger mistake this time. Jericho, when you helped that boy, he was wearing three things that frightened me to death. Two guns and a look of a man spoiling for a fight. Today, he wasn't wearing either. That don't mean he's not dangerous. No, it doesn't. But it means he isn't looking for trouble. Jericho, you always said Pat Garrett was a good man. If he helped Billy, he must have had a mighty good reason. Sarah, Billy's a killer. Twenty-one men. And you're a minister of God. Your business is saving souls, not delivering them to the scaffold. Maybe God allowed Billy this reprise. And maybe God's showing me my duty. Maybe he is. Maybe he is, Jericho. But before I'd do anything rash, I'd talk to him first. To Billy? No, Jericho. To God. Hello. Good morning. I'm Reverend Jericho Jones. This is my wife, Sarah. How do you do? Howdy. We just dropped in to get acquainted. And to found out if you'd run an article in your newspaper about our gospel services. We'll be in town the next four Sundays. We'd be happy to do it. Ain't had a preacher in these parts since I've been here. That's going on 15 years. Sheep who are lost cannot be expected to find the shepherd. Four Corners can sure stand some religion. How about some music at the meetin'? I'll play and my friend Holt will sing. He's got a store down the street. Ben thinks everyone around here has talent. l ospptoave you join our services. Tell me, that young man that just left here, has he been in town long? You mean Bill Antrim? He came in about a week ago. You know, there's something strange about him. Do you know him? Why, yes. I... We meet so many people. Jericho sometimes just gets them mixed up. Well, we'll see you Sunday. All right, fine. Goodbye. Thank you. Goodbye. See you. Goodbye. Thank you. A straight. Well, it beats my two pair. For Tonya's old age. You won't be around that long if you don't get away from me. You're a jinx. Then why you bring me here? Oh, shut up and fetch us some coffee. By me. I'll open. I'm in. Cards? Two. Give me three. I'll call and raise you twenty, Slade. Give me your money, Tonya. I will not. Come on, hand it over. Thanks. (SPEAKING SPANISH) You cheap gringo! Well, I didn't make it. Oh, that beats me. (SPEAKING SPANISH) What about Tonya, Slade? I'll bet the girl against your winnings. TONYA: You're all pigs. Dirty, filthy pigs. And you, you are the worst pig of all. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPITS) What are you going to do, let her get away with it? She'll come back, Piute, she always does. What did I tell ya? Hello, Bill. I see you didn't take my advice about wearing a gun. What are you doing here? I'm moving in. This place belongs to me. The Colonel didn't say anything to me about this. Here's my bill of sale, signed by the legal owner. I'll keep this. I think you're lying. You heard the man. If he owns the place, he owns it. Come on. Well, don't just stand there, Tonya. Get your things together. Nobody else takes orders from you, why should I? This about squares us, Bill. You've butted into my play for the last time, Slade. He asked for it. Put him on his horse. I don't care how it happened. You didn't have to kill him. Jardine was my top gun hand. Look, Colonel, when a man starts gunning for you, you either drop him permanent or give him a chance to pot-shoot you in the back some other time. Jardine tried it once before. That fight could have been avoided, if you hadn't sided with Antrim. He owns the place. What if he does? I use it. Get him out of there. You're the boss. Don't forget it, Mr. Slade. Take care of it as soon as we get the cattle back to the home ranch. Piute! Starting tomorrow, I want you to find out which ranches the army intends to use for polling places. Remind the owners how I feel about it. You tell the other ranchers to stay away from the polls. (DOOR OPENS) What are you up to? I was hungry. Do you make a habit of eating in the dark? I did not want to disturb you. Hmm, thanks. I can pay for what I take. I know. You left this behind. What's your name? My name is Tonya. Tonya, huh? Where do you live? I see. Well, Tony, I'm sorry Jardine got himself killed, but you can't stay here. I did not ask to stay here. All right, take what you want. When you finish, you'll find a horse in the barn. And I'll be obliged if you'll leave him at the livery stable in town. You do not work for Colonel Morgan? No. Then how you know I don't keep your horse? Horse thieves have a habit of coming to a bad end. How long you going to stay here? For the rest of my life, I hope. Maybe that won't be so very long, if you don't work for Morgan. I'll take that chance. You like my dress? It's very nice. Want I should dance for you? Uh, some other time. Don't forget about that horse. Good night. (HUMMING) Oh, wait, senor. My clean floor. Here. Come and get it. I have your breakfast ready. It is good, yes? Mmm-hmm. But you can't stay here. But why not? You see I'm a good cook and I'm a good housekeeper. I don't want any trouble. You were not afraid last night. I'm not afraid this morning. I just don't want any trouble. Now you'd better go home. I have no home and no people. Can't you get a job in town? Everyone knows I have been cook for Colonel Morgan's men. Oh, please, Senor Bill. I will work hard and be very quiet. All right, you can stay. Till I think of something else. Gracias. Hiya, Jack. Mornin'. I just finished breakfast, but if you'd care for a cup of coffee... Haven't got time. I got bad news for you. You're gonna have to move. Colonel Morgan give you a little trouble this morning, huh? No one gives Jack Slade trouble. Let's just say he's unhappy with you. Well, what was I supposed to do? Go over there and ask his permission to take over my own place? You might have been better off. Well, you know it belongs to me. I hired my guns out to Colonel Morgan. I'm paid to see things his way. Too bad we're on opposite sides of the fence, but that's the way it is. I'll think it over. Don't take too long. Hi, Ben. Here's your paper. How about a little music? How about some coffee first? You've got to help us, Reverend Jones. We've been here for 12 years. My husband's not a coward, but they half beat him to death for just putting up a fence around his own land. He says he can't fight them, so we're going to have to move. There's no law, Reverend. Nobody to turn to. If you can't help us, we're lost. I'll do what I can. Thank you, Reverend. Another one? The fifth today. Sarah, I've just got to do something. These are fine people, good people. They're coming to me for help. Darling, now you listen to me. This is a war. A gun war. It can only be settled with guns. Cleaning up this town is not a job for a preacher. What we need is a... A gunfighter, a killer! We know such a man. You wouldn't... Jericho, he couldn't do it alone. Not one man against so many. Sarah, David conquered Goliath. You wouldn't ask him? I'd ask him this very moment if I knew I was doing right. It could mean his life and yours. My life is a pledge to God. His is a debt to God. It would be a fair exchange for the destruction of this evil. I must think this over. (PLAYING BANJO) COWHAND: Let her rip, Ben. ONLOOKER: Yeehaw! (WHOOPS) Ellie! Ellie McCloud! Well, I see you received your copy of the Weekly Bugle, Colonel Morgan. Yes, I did, Miss McCloud. Here's your delivery boy. Ben! I tried to deliver them, Ellie. I tried. I'll take him inside, Ellie. You've put out the last edition of the Bugle, Miss McCloud. The paper will come out next week as usual. I've waited a long time to meet you, Jefferson Morgan. Colonel Morgan to you, preacher. I give no titles to jackals. I've heard the word Morgan before. I've heard it used with fear by the weak, with disgust and contempt by the righteous. I've heard men say that west of Texas there's no law but Jefferson Morgan. Well, they're wrong. There is a law, Morgan. There's a law greater than you or a thousand like you. It's the law of God. You've chosen to defy that law. Why you and your kind, you're a plague, not only in the eyes of God but in the eyes of man. Preying upon the weak and the innocent. Hiding behind a wall of hired guns. I tell you, Morgan, your days... No! No! Don't! Piute! You've got a lot of courage, preacher, but if I was you, I'd keep my nose out of politics. Mr. Bentley, would you please take him into the other room? The doctor will be here shortly. Yes, ma'am. There must be something you can do to stop these outrages, Paul. I have no authority to establish law and order in this territory. However, we'll protect the people that come in to vote. Most of the people will be afraid to come in and vote. The Colonel has warned them to stay away. Freedom to live without fear is man's most treasured possession. Matthew McCloud demonstrated that. Maybe so, Parson, but it just don't make sense for men like us to go up against the guns of Colonel Morgan or Jack Slade. Ellie, why don't you leave town until after the election. Some of my troopers will escort you across the Texas line. I appreciate your offer, Paul, but, well, I can't accept it. I guess there's a stubborn streak in the McClouds. I'll be at my camp if you change your mind. Thank you, Paul. You just forget all this trouble and relax a little, Ellie. I'll drop in later and see how Ben's doing. If we only had somebody... Anybody who had the courage to stand up against these killers. A David to conquer this Goliath. Ellie, there's something I should tell you about Bill Antrim. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Come in. Oh, I was looking for Mr. Antrim. Doesn't he live here? Si. I live here too. Why you want to see Bill? I'd rather discuss it with him, if you don't mind. He is not here! I'll wait. Oh, Bill! You have been gone so long. Tonya miss you. Nice to see you, Miss McCloud. Get Miss McCloud some coffee. Wait on her yourself. I'm sorry this had to happen. Tonya's just here until... You don't owe me any explanations or apologies. Mr. Antrim, my printer was flogged this morning by Morgan and his men for trying to deliver papers. I drove out here to talk to you. At the suggestion of Jericho Jones. What did he say about me? He intimated you were the one man with the courage and skill to stand up to those gun fighters. Nothing else? No. Well, he's wrong. I told you before, I'm not taking sides. Is it... Is it because Jack Slade is a friend of yours? A man like Slade has no friends. In fact he dropped by this morning and warned me to get off my ranch, before he had to come gunning for me. Then you're in the middle of this whether you like it or not. Bill, the people here are disorganized. They need a leader. You've proven you're not afraid. If you're going to stay you'll have to fight. Why... Why should you fight alone? Miss McCloud... Maybe I don't want to fight. You mean you'd let them drive you away from your home? I haven't decided yet. I'm terribly sorry I bothered you, Mr. Antrim. I can't understand why Reverend Jones ever thought the people would follow you. Start packing. I'm taking you in to town. I did not mean to make you angry, Bill. I will not do it again. You won't have a chance. That woman! I hate her. She is no good for you, Bill, with her fancy clothes and her stuck-up ways. She's our lady if that's what's gripin' you. (CRIES OUT) (SCREAMING) I know her kind! She wouldn't spit on you if she didn't want something! Start packing! (WAILS) Oh, Mr. Antrim! I've been wanting to talk to you. I'm kind of busy, preacher. This is very important. All right. Wait he, Torea. I see you're not carrying a gun. I don't carry guns. Billy the Kid carried a gun. Billy the Kid is dead. And I've been wanting to thank you for leaving him that way. You've got Sarah to thank for that. If it had been me, I'd have turned you in the moment I saw you. Can't say that I blame you, Jericho. I've been a disappointment to you ever since I was a kid, haven't I? Yes, you have, Billy. You know, outside of Pat Garrett you're the only man I've ever trusted. You used to tell Ma back on the farm I'd make a fine doctor. Said I had the eyes and hands for it, remember? It's been a long time. I haven't forgotten it. Billy... Billy, when I helped you years ago, I did that because I realized you were too young to understand that no man was big enough to take the law into his own hands. I thought you were worth saving, but I'll tell you this... I've regretted it ever since. You listen to me, Jericho. You think I'm not grateful for my life, don't you? You think I went on killin' because I liked it. Well, you're wrong. I got out to get the man who murdered my best friend in cold blood. That's all I ever intended to do. But when I'd finished the job the law should have done, I found I had a reputation as a gunslinger with a price on my head. I had to keep on killing or end up with a slug in my own guts. I didn't know in the beginning, but I found out that once you're on a killer's road, there's no way back. And the only way ahead is over the bodies of the men who want to prove that they're faster with a gun than you are. I woke up one morning to the fact that the only way I could stop killin' was to get killed myself. So I got killed, and I want to stay that way. Billy the Kid is dead, and Bill Antrim will never touch a gun as long as he lives. It's strange, Billy, but our destinies are not always in our own hands. What do you mean by that? I've called you in here to strap on a gun. You're crazy. I know it sounds ridiculous, especially after what you've just told me, Billy. But maybe this is God's will. Maybe you were called here for just this thing. You know about Ben? Stop it. You've heard of McCloud. Shut up! You know what those killers are doing in this town? Danny, you can't do this to me. I told you, I'm through with guns and killin'. I want to live like a human being, not like an animal. Do you know what my life has been like up till now? Do you? The kind of loneliness that takes your insides in a fist and squeezes the guts out of them until you want to put a gun to your head and pull the trigger? Do you know what it's like to sit up on a bluff, hungry, cold, miserable, looking at the lights below, behind the windows, where men are at peace in their own kitchens with wives piling food on their plates, and kids howling, no, no fear of tomorrow, no ugly memory of what happened yesterday. Do you? The poor squatters got more than any outlaw ever had. All those lonely nights on the trail looking for some place where I wouldn't be recognized. I've had one thought, one dream, to get out. To have a home and a wife and a kid. This is my only chance, the only one I'll ever get. You, you can't take that away from me. Do you recognize these? I took them from your grave to use as a symbol of evil in my services. But now, Billy, you can use them as an instrument for good. I won't do it. I won't. As soon as I put those guns on I'm finished. If Jack Slade doesn't get me, the law will. And if both of them don't, I'd be right back where I was before, which is worse. I owe you my life. All right, take it back. Go out there and tell 'em I'm Billy the Kid, but I won't touch another gun. There's a time in every man's life when he must face himself. You're at that point now, Billy. The scriptures tell us it's our duty to fight tyranny and oppression. Why, the people of this community, they're like children lost in the wilderness, crying out for help. You can't turn your back on them. I can and I will. This isn't my fight. I'm not a fool like Ben, or a martyr like McCloud. You can turn me in if you want, but don't expect me to give up everything I've wanted all my life to save the necks of those chicken-livered men in this town who haven't got the guts to fight their own battles. All right, Billy. Have it your own way. But come to the meeting Sunday, that's all I ask. Here. This'll keep you going until you can find a job. I have money. Well, adios until Sunday. Why Sunday? Senor Jericho expects you at the meeting. You were listening. Don't be afraid, I won't tell anyone. If I tell they will kill you, and I want you alive, Billy the Kid. Besides, you cannot leave me so easily now that I've decided I love you. (ORGAN PLAYING) ¶ When dark clouds ¶ Hide your skies of blue (MUFFLED SINGING) Good morning, Mr. Antrim. Good morning, Miss McCloud. I hardly expected to see you here. But I am glad you came, Bill. ¶ A hand that's strong ¶ Is waiting just to help you ¶ Find your way ¶ So pray ¶ Sometimes you and I need help ¶ Remember there's more in this world than yourself ¶ So don't be afraid ¶ Look up to the sky and say ¶ I believe ¶ I believe ¶ This old world now will seem serene ¶ Faith is yours on which to lean ¶ All because ¶ You took the time to pray ¶ Take the time ¶ To pray ¶ As a minister of the gospel, I find myself torn between the spiritual teachings of God and the fundamental needs of man. Both are necessary to survival. So I've decided today to devote the services to the immediate problem that faces this community. This is a Godless and a lawless territory. But you, you have that power to change that tomorrow at the polls. (ALL MURMURING) Just now I watched a man walk down the aisle, and I saw fear in the eyes of each and every one of you. Of what are you afraid? His power? His tyranny? Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered. Those are not my words, they are the words of Thomas Paine to the beleaguered Americans at Valley Forge. e men died so that you could enjoy a thing called freedom. So that you could live without fear. Are you then prepared to give up this freedom? And walk in the shadow of this man, with his hired guns? Fear is a deadly poison. Stand up and cast out fear. Destroy the evil that walks among ye, ye knight in the power of the Lord, and no one or nothing can stand against you. Let us pray. (GUNSHOTS) (WHOOPING) MAN: Come on, come on. Get out of here! Let's get out! (ALL CLAMORING) It's the newspaper office! (GLASS SHATTERING) I'll take you inside. Morgan, nothing would give me more pleasure than to arrest you and your men, and it may just happen yet. I built this town and I'll run it as I see fit, and that goes for the rest of the country around here. Not anymore. I just received orders from my commanding officer to establish martial law. There wouldn't be any people in this territory if it wasn't for me. They'll do as I tell 'em, martial law or not martial law. Don't push your luck. If there's any further disturbances around here, I'll send for more troops. I'll hold you personally responsible. Piute, we can't fight the army. My cousin War Eagle would. Get a hold of him. Tell him we've got plenty of guns and firewater for his braves. I could... I could kill 'em all with my own hands. I... But I can't fight alone, I can't! I haven't even got a paper to fight them with. (SOBBING) Is it really that important? Oh, it's more important than anything in the world. I... You could do it, I know you could. Why, I was talking to Jericho only this morning. He said you were the fastest man with a gun he ever saw. And once Slade and Morgan are out of the way, the people wouldn't be afraid to come to town and vote. So that's why you played up to me? You figured it was the only way you could get me to put on my guns and kill for you. Oh, no, Bill. Why don't you be honest with me, Ellie? All right! All right! There's only one thing that would justify my father's death, and that's the annexation of this territory to Texas. And you'd do anything to see it happen, wouldn't you? Tonya was right. She said you wouldn't spit on me if you didn't need me. Ellie, our troubles are over. Lieutenant Nash is going to declare martial law. Oh, it's... It's too good to be true. I just heard him tell Colonel Morgan. Miss McCloud... It appears you wasted your time on me. (SOBBING) Who did it, Tonya? Slade. Why? I come back to wait for you. Slade showed up, he was going to burn the cabin, I tried to stop him. You're a fool, Tonya. Si, Bill, I'm a fool. You wait, I'll get some water. Si, Billy, I wait. (GASPS) I do keep running into you in the strangest places, Antrim. Why, you filthy... Shut up, Tonya. I warned you to move out. You should have listened. BILLY: You didn't have to burn it, Slade. I was going to leave. I just made up my mind. I'll peddle my team and wagon tomorrow and be on my way. Oh, Billy, fight him now. I don't want you to go away. If you kill him, the preacher, he satisfied. I told you, Tony, I don't want any trouble. You see... You see what they have done to me? Well, what do you expect me to do about it? I told you, kill him! You know I don't carry a gun. I'll give you a gun, Antrim. Anything to oblige the lady. There ain't a man alive who would stand up against Jack Slade and live. TONYA: There was a man. Billy the Kid. He would not have stood here and been outfaced by this cheap gringo! Shut up, Tonya! Don't you ever say that to me. I've looked for Billy the Kid for years. He died before I could prove I was faster than him. Perhaps you're right. This thing is not a man. You are a beater of women, but he... He is a mouse. Maybe you take me back to town, Mr. Slade. Sure, Tonya. So long, Antrim. Don't be too long about hitching up your team. (WHOOPING) I don't like it a bit, Jericho. Where are the rest of Colonel Morgan's buzzards? You know, it's much too quiet around here. They won't try to fight the army, Ben. Don't forget, Lieutenant Nash declared martial law. Well, I wish them troopers would show up. Nobody's going to vote until they do. They'll show up. (GUNSHOTS) (WHOOPING) (ALL CLAMORING) (HORSE APPROACHING) I found the Lieutenant lying on the road just outside of town. Before he died, he said something about Indian ambush. All the men are dead. But we ain't had any Indian trouble around here for years. Perhaps Colonel Morgan can explain why the Indians suddenly went on the warpath. You and your men wouldn't have dared terrorize this town if you hadn't of known about it. (CROWD CONTINUES CLAMORING) Quiet, all of you. Quiet! Quiet! (CLAMORING STOPS) The polls are closed. I don't want to hear any more grumbling. If you don't like what goes on in this territory, you can pack up and get out. I'll notify the army tomorrow. You're nothing but sheep! Don't you realize what you're losing? It may be years before you'll have the chance to break the rule of these outlaws by voting. You're wasting your breath, Ellie. All right, clear out all of you! Go on home. Just a moment, Morgan. These people are going to get their chance to vote. Put your hands up. Every one of you. And don't mistake me. I believe he means what he says. (CHUCKLES) If you figure on doing any serious shooting there, parson, I'd suggest you cock those guns. Oh, Jericho! (SOBBING) Jericho! No. No! Jericho... Oh, no! That man you shot down, Mr. Slade, was a minister to all. The guns he was holding when he fell were the only guns he ever touched. The guns he removed from the cross on a grave of a notorious outlaw he once befriended. You once knew that outlaw as Billy the Kid. Only Billy the Kid is not dead! He's here to claim his guns, Mr. Slade. (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) BILLY: This way, Slade. (GRUNTS) All right, Billy, you got the man that killed your best friend. Put up your guns, I can use a man like you. I'm the only law around here. Ride with me and you're a free man. Draw, Morgan. Don't be a fool, Billy. It's five against one. Draw! (GUNSHOTS) (ALL CLAMORING) What are you standing there for? That's what you wanted, isn't it? Goodbye, Jericho. (ALL CLAMORING) Billy! Billy! Billy! Oh, Billy. Billy, take me with you. Billy!
