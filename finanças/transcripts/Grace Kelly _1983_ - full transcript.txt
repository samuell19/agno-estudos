(FAMILY FROLICKING) MARGARET KELLY: Grace? I don't want you standing near the window. You're going to make your cold worse. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Way over with that front leg, Kal. Wonderful! Come on! Beautiful! (WHISTLE BLOWING) Sweetheart, remember what I told you, now? Linda Martin... As the fairy godmother. Monica Grant... As Cinderella. Grace Kelly as the prince. When I knew I'd won, the first thing I wanted to do... I couldn't wait to get over and shake my dad's hand. Because I was really happy for his sake that I was able to win this one. He went on to win the Olympics. But as you know, they wouldn't let him row at Henley. They said he wasn't a gentlemen because he'd worked with his hands. And he still does. Although he's built the biggest brick company in the land. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Son, I want you to know that you have given me great happiness. You finally accomplished what I was denied. You went to Henley, and you won the diamond! (AUDIENCE CLAPPING) (SPORTS CHATTER) I gotta go. You can do it without me. -Daddy. -Hello there, Grace. Feeling any better? Yes. Did Mother talk to you? About what? Oh. She did mention something to me about you and the theater? -I want to be an actress. -Yeah, that's what she said. Since when? -Since always. -Since always? Well then it's nothing that has to be decided overnight, is it? Now, there's plenty of time to think it through. Well I have thought it through Grace, you've only just graduated from high school. Daddy, how many times have you seen me perform? Aren't you a little too shy for the stage? Well maybe that's why. When I'm acting, playing a part, it's a way of not being me. It's a way of being somebody else. -Somebody wonderful. -The acting business is a one in a million shot. And it's a lousy life, especially for a woman, even if you do get lucky. -What about Uncle George and Uncle Walter... -Hey, way to go! -Another touchdown. George is a writer. Besides, your uncles have nothing to lose. Your life has all kinds of possibilities. -Why do you feel you have to rush into something right now? -I have an audition. -An audition? -Well, a chance to audition. For the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, in New York. Academy of Dramatic Arts. Grace, you know your mother and I have always planned on you going to college. A nice university where you can meet intelligent, interesting people. -Take up acting there, at college. -It's not the same thing. -The theater is no place for... -For what? For my daughter! You've always told us, if we're going to play, we should play to win. Yes, and I've also said cover your bets. Grace, you're a big girl. I can't tell you what to do. But I've got this gut feeling, -and I don't feel right about it. -But I do. What if I disapprove? I hope you won't. Okay, okay. But it's certainly not the game I'd have chosen. I won't disappoint you. Now, let's see Tom and Grace. Tom, you're getting ready for an appointment. Make it really pressing. Why don't you get your props while I give Grace her objective. Try not to anticipate. Okay, Grace, here's your objective. You're pregnant. Tom is the guy that did it. He's an irresponsible kind of guy, but you think you can bring him around. You're objective is to get him to marry you, okay? Why don't you go outside and prepare, and come back when you're ready. Okay, Grace, come in. (KNOCKING) TOM: Yeah, come on in. What are you doing here? What do you want? Come on, I don't have time. What do you want? I have to talk to you. Come on, what, are you hard of hearing? Talk! DIRECTOR: Come on, Grace. Concentrate on your objective. You have to marry me. Marry you? (LAUGHING) What the hell for? -I'm pregnant. -So what's that to me? -It's your baby. -Mine? Mine? Hey, don't pull that on me, alright? I'll get plenty of guys down here to swear that they've slept with you. Alright? Just go, okay? I don't want to look at you. Go. Go! -Go with your instincts! What are you feeling? -(SIGHS) I'm sorry. What's your problem? -I just can't do it. -Find something in your own experience. Something you really had to get, and relate to that. Yeah, why don't you just make-believe that I'm your father or something and that you just have to have the Rolls Royce for the evening. (CLASS LAUGHS) When I want help, I'll ask for it. Tom, why don't you sit down. -Very good. -Yeah. Just once, I would like you to use yourself, what's inside you. Maybe you have an emotional block. Maybe you'll never be able to express yourself as an actress. Maybe you just don't have it. That's it for today. I'll see you tomorrow. (CLASS MURMURING) STUDENT: Who wants to take me out to eat? Hey, a few of us are going to Geno's for dinner. You wanna come? I have to prepare for a reading tomorrow. Um, have you gotten to know anybody, I mean, except me, since you've been here? -Not really. -So come with us. Besides, it's my treat. You wouldn't have to pay for me. Relax, I am loaded. I just did a TV commercial last week. Is it like modeling? I have an audition tomorrow. Why don't you come with me? -What's it for? -It's for cigarettes. It's your audition, I wouldn't want to complicate it for you. Are you kidding? This thing is going to be a cattle call. Everybody in town is gonna be there, and you are going. -Okay? -Okay. (COUGHING) (FAMILY SINGING JINGLE BELLS ) Got a few more here. -Great! -The tree looks great! No, no, not over there. The tree's not ready yet. Ma will tell you what to do with 'em. Ma, where do I put these? (ALL CHATTERING) You know, this is supposed to be a family night, not a frat party. Luzanne, turn off the television. Oh, but this is interesting, ma. Let's have some Christmas music. -Yeah, anything except Dad. -There, ha, finally got 'em. Just need to put this away. (DOOR BELL) The Austin's, I bet that's them. I'm sure it is. Merry Christmas! -Hello, everybody. -Hello, Russ. -Merry Christmas. For your little Christmas tree. -Oh thank you so much. -Hey, Merry Christmas, old man. -Hey, Jack. -Merry Christmas, Edie. -Oh, Jack, how are you? (CHATTER) And he made it himself. -How are you, sweetheart? -Couldn't be better. How's life in the big city, Gracie? -Hey! It's Grace on television! -What? For a fortune of smoking satisfaction. For a full, satisfying taste and smoking pleasure, light up and smoke -an Old Gold. -I didn't know you smoked. (CLAPPING) Now that's acting, huh? Say there, Kelly. Looks like you're gonna have another start in the family. You gotta start somewhere I guess. Tell your father about the new agent. Tell him! What's up, then? Edie Van Cleve came to see me do a scene in class. -Who's Edie Van Cleve, what's she do? -She's an agent. A very good agent. And she wants to represent me. Will somebody come and help me, huh? You want me to do this all myself? Well, (CLEARS THROAT) you know, I'd like to propose a toast. Uh, Dad. Here's to a, uh, Merry Christmas, and... -A very happy new year. -ALL: Merry Christmas. I love the pork this time of year, don't you? I love every smell and every sound. -Do you come here often... -Uh, thank you Miss Kelly. Thank you very much. -Should I leave this here? -Uh, yes. Yes, please. Too intelligent looking. Alright, now that's it. Wet your lips. Wet your lips. There, that's it. Give me a smile. Smile down. Good! Got it. But still you come back. For what? My...sympathy? I don't think so. I think you come back for this. Because it makes you feel like you're someone. It isn't much, is it? Thank you, Miss Kelly. That's fine. -Hi. -Hi. -Grace Kelly. -Rita Gam. I don't know about you, but I think we're both too young. Oh, it is so gloomy and awful in there all the time. Like a winter night. But when you come home, father, it's like a morning in spring when they open the double windows. Have you read much Sternburg? -No, I haven't. -Do you know what the play is about? Well I think so. Let's talk about it a little. Then you can read for us again. I believe her scene is on page... 16. (HORNS HONKING) (CLAPPING) (CLAPPING CONTINUES) Here she is. (LAUGHING) -You were wonderful, dear. -Yeah, good job, Grace, good job. Congratulations. Now, where is that champagne that I... Ah, there it is. -Really, Mother, I wasn't just awful? -You were perfect. Did you like the play, Daddy? Well, it was a little heavy I thought. (CORK POPPING) (KNOCKING) Mady, it's Grace. Can I come in? Oh, yes. Come in, come in. -Hello, Miss Kelly. -Hello. Oh, you were so wonderful. -Thank you. Are you enjoying your first opening night? -Of course. -And did your parents get here? -Yes. And did they tell you how good you were? -Because you were. -Hmm, mixed reviews. Oh dear, a drink will help. (GRACE LAUGHS) -Papa doesn't want you to be an actress? -How did you know? Neither did mine. I remember my first opening night. The glow lasted three whole days. -And now? -And now it lasts 'till the lights dim and the applause dies away. And you thought that when you got to Broadway, everything would change, as if by magic. Hmm, something like that. (MADY LAUGHS) Well don't let me spoil your evening. May the glow last for three whole days. -Happy days. -Happy days. (KNOCKING) I suppose we better let them in, or we'll never get out of here. -I am starving. -Are you staying up for the reviews? All my opening nights, I've learned one very important thing. It's not the critics, the audience, or anyone else you have to please. You can only please yourself. And you were good tonight! But if by chance the critics say some wonderful things, you can bring the papers to me in the morning. But if they don't, we'll pretend I never asked. (BOTH LAUGHING) Marilyn, let them in. (LAUGHING CONTINUES) -Good morning. -Good morning, come in. -Must be good news. -The Times was the best. Oh good. Not bad. (SIGHS) We could run a couple of months on this. That's all? I'm afraid so. Who is this handsome man? Albert WilliaMiss (CHUCKLES) We were madly in love. -What happened? -I've been in love with most of my leading men. Till the play closed anyway. Cream? No, thanks. And then? And then there was another play. Rehearsals, fittings... The usual hysteria. There was never time for anything more. -Do you ever see them again? -Mm. Whenever it happens. We remain friends. No regrets? Of course not. But I must admit, even the best opening night is better if it's shared with someone. Preferably the same someone. I haven't had that luxury. Oh... (LAUGHS) What young dreams have I shattered now? (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hi, Edie. I was at ballet class. Jake Hanser? Of course I know who Fred Zinnemann is. Gary Cooper? (SIGHS) I won't get it. I haven't got a chance. 20 minutes? My hair, my nails, I... Can't you change the appointment? Yes. I've got it. -Hello, Miss Kelly. -Hello. -May I take your coat? -No. I mean, -I'm fine. -Oh, well then do sit down. Well, Edie Van Cleve is very excited about you. So, tell me a little bit about what you've done. I cannot recall anyone ever coming to an interview wearing white gloves. PASTOR: Do you, Amy, take Will to be your lawfully wedded husband, from this day forward until death do you part? I do. The ring please. Then by the authority invested in me by the laws of this territory, I pronounce you man and wife. (LAUGHING) You know I can't speak for the rest of you men, but I claim an ancient privilege. -Cut. -High Noon, scene 117, take 12. -And marker. -We break for lunch. Grace? Relax, you'll feel better after lunch. Remember how we talked about playing it very happily. Very happily. Oh, everything is so clear with cooper. He makes it look so easy. When you look into his face, you see everything he's feeling. When I look into my face, I see nothing. -Absolutely nothing. -Grace, don't be so hard on yourself. Mother, I was awful in the movie. Really awful. I feel all these things, but it... Just doesn't come out. Darling, it takes time. I'm sure you did very well in the film and you'll be even better in the next one. -Next one? -You will see. Grace, we're so proud of you. Really. I know you are, Mother. And your father, more proud than any of us. -Well, I wish that were true. -Our daughter's getting awful good, Ma. She almost beat me that last set. Oh you mean I won a couple there for a change? (LAUGHS) That should inspire you. How's your game, Grace? I haven't run you around the court in a long time. How about some mixed doubles this weekend, huh? I can't. I have to go back to New York. I'm doing a television show. -Why? You just finished that...movie! -Jack. Grace doesn't feel that she did well in the film. Yeah, that's what I understand. You know, I, uh... I once thought that I was gonna be a great runner. They started beating me, and I decided that I'd take up rowing instead. Oh, thank you. What's that supposed to mean? What do you think, Grace? Maybe this would be a good time for you to reevaluate this... Acting business, hmm? Well, I'm a Kelly, Father. Remember? A licking's not a failure. It's not the fact that you're licked, it's how you fight. A black eye is nothing to be ashamed of. Remember? Good memory. You said it to me so often. And I believed it. Are we gonna play again tomorrow, Dad? Hey, Lizzie Doll. (SIGHS) Don't look so surprised, Jack. She's your daughter. Miss Kelly, It's Jay Kanter, calling from Hollywood. -Grace, Jay. -Hello! Remember what we spoke about? We got the green light. John Ford wants you for Mogambo with Gable. -Picture shoots in Africa. -Africa? Yeah, now listen, Grace. This one's for M.G.M. They're gonna want a contract, seven years. It did sound too good to be true, didn't it? -Jay, we've been through this. -Grace, this is M.G.M. we're talking about. This is Clark Gable. It's John Ford. Don't blow it! I have to think about it, Jay, I really do. This one could make your career, Grace. And they need to know. It's a free trip to Africa! (GRACE SIGHS) -Okay. -Okay. -On two conditions. -That's what I was afraid of. First, that I get to live in New York between pictures. That's impossible, Grace. You know that. And second, that every other year, I'm allowed to do a play. Also impossible. What else? I'm serious, Jay. That's the deal. Look, Grace, I can try. -Thank you. -Don't thank me yet. I said I can try. M.G.M. does not go for actors telling them how to write contracts. It's gonna be a small miracle if I pull this one off. MARGARET: I don't like the idea of you being so far away. GRACE: Oh, Mama, what could possibly happen? MARGARET: It's Africa, isn't it? You said you'd be living in tents. Practically out in the jungle. Wild animals, bugs. Clark Gable. I don't think they call him The King for nothing. Have you ever been married? No, I've never had the good fortune of finding a lady who was interested. -That could be the remark of a cynical man. -Me? What have I got to be cynical about? I've done alright. And I make my contribution in this mixed up community they call the world. What else is there? That could be the remark of a lonely man. Could be. Looks like we're in for a little storm. Let's get back to camp. DIRECTOR: Cut. Very good. -You were great. -Thank you, sir. DIRECTOR: That's a wrap. Evening. Evenin'. I finished it. Why, thank you. You know, I don't remember anyone ever knitting me one sock before. (GRACE LAUGHS) Well I'll start the other one tomorrow. If you're lucky, I'll have it finished for Christmas. If not, I'll just hang this one out on the tree. See what Santa Claus brings me. -Are you still planning on going out on safari? -Ah sure, why? I would like to go. There'll be all kind of creepy crawly things out there. Well I guess I'll just have to tell them to keep their distance, won't I? You never cease to surprise me. I thought you knew everything there was to know about women. Yeah, so did I... So did I. Mr. Gable! Mr. Gable! There are these rumors from Africa about the two of you falling in love. -What about it, Mr. Gable? -You flatter me. I'm old enough to be her father. Miss Kelly, what about the two of you going off on... That's my flight there. Miss Kelly, what about the two of you going off hunting together? Miss Kelly, tell us what happened on the safari. (REPORTERS CLAMORING) Your attention please. Final call for flight 103 to Los Angeles. I can't believe these people. -I didn't know what to say. -Gotta get used to it. There'll be a lot of reporters around you from now on. -Clark, that was the last call. We'd better go. -Thanks. I wish we were in Africa. I'll see you around, kid. You're gonna miss him, aren't you? I'll miss all of them. They were a wonderful cast and crew. If you'll excuse me, gentlemen... When do you plan to see him again? (JOURNALISTS CLAMORING) So if I talk to reporters, they don't leave me alone. If I don't talk to them, they invent all these things about me. The price of celebrity n'est pas ? So, when will you go to Los Angeles? -Not for a few days, the film's been delayed. -I'm delighted. -So am I... -I can't believe this. I've just come from admiring you in your movie. -Won't you introduce us? -Grace, this is Oleg Cassini. -You didn't just see Mogambo , did you? -I swear it. I'm sorry I can't ask you to join us. Oh, that's alright. I am with a friend. Another time. Nice to have seen you. Oleg Cassini? An Italian designer with a Russian title. Or is it the other way around? (LAUGHS) -Are you sure there's no card? -Nope. -How odd. -Yes, it is. -There you go. -Thank you, Miss Kelly. -By the way, you were great in Mogambo. -Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. (PHONE RINGING) -Hello? -Ah, you haven't left yet. -Who is this? -Your friendly florist. -Mr. Cassini? -Will you have dinner with me Friday night? Any place you like. -Well, I... -The restaurant where we met? -It was very lucky for me. -I'm afraid I have to fly to Los Angeles this afternoon. Fine, I'll pick you up at eight on Friday, in Los Angeles, hmm? (LAUGHING) Do you always go to such lengths for dinner? If the temptation is great enough. Is it a date? How can I refuse? -How's your leg? -Hurts a little. -And your stomach. -Empty as a football. -And your love life? -Mm, not too active. -Oh? Anything else bothering you? -Mhm. Who are you? Cut! And print that. They held the separation perfectly. -How was that? -Exceptional. -I guess that should melt the lady-like image. -I hope not. The audience has come to see Grace play the lady so they can wonder if she's a harlot in the bedroom. If it's alright with you, Mr. Hitchcock, I'd like to keep them guessing. -Do you think we'll have to reset my hair? -No, I don't think it'll be -necessary. You've got plenty of curl left. We'll just brush it out into a nice, soft page boy. I think it'll look great with your new dress. -Fine. -I think we have about an hour till the next shot. -Why don't you just go and relax in your dressing room... -Grace Kelly... Grace? Friday, as promised. Can you just pick up and leave whatever you're doing whenever you'd like to? I come from a long line of nomads. I learned to move quickly, and follow my heart. (GRACE LAUGHS) You know, I've never ever done that before. It took all my courage. I'm basically a very shy person. Oh, well that's not what I heard. What have you heard about me, hmm? That I like to be seen with beautiful women? Obviously true. (LAUGHS) Will you stop? (LAUGHS) You are so different from everything I've heard about you. Oh, distant, cool. -Made out of steel. -Mhm. A femme fatale. A huntress. (LAUGHS) Me? (LAUGHS) Well, I won't pretend that I discovered the real Grace Kelly in one evening. Perhaps you're still discovering yourself. (PANTING) I don't think this steak and prune diet is working. It takes at least a week before you see any results. Well if it doesn't work by Sunday, I'm going back to grapefruit. If it doesn't work by Sunday, I'm going back to lasagna. (LAUGHING) That's it, enough. Come on, Grace. Five more minutes. (GRACE GROANS) If I had known you were a sadist, Rita Gam, -I never would have ask you to move in with me. -It's good for what ails you. All those rich dinners with Cassini. And will you please tell him that I'm allergic to roses? You're so jealous. (RITA LAUGHING) (BOTH LAUGHING) 47, 48, 49. (SIGHS OF RELIEF) Right. You know I have to go in. You know I do. A nightcap? You're not being fair. (OLEG LAUGHS) You know I have an early call. You have a date with Mr. Hitchcock. (LAUGHING) I'll miss you. Till tomorrow. Goodnight. Wait. You stay here. -And no more roses! -Oh! -Goodnight! -Sweet dreaMiss Grace, are you going to Sammy Cohen's party? No one to go with. What happened to Oleg? He went back to New York. (RITA SIGHS) I've been working so much. I dunno, it just got complicated. Figures, he couldn't stand the competition. It wasn't a competition. Work's not the only thing I want in my life. Miss him? Yes. You never stop surprising me, Grace. I always imagined you with someone like... Franklin Roosevelt. Or at the very least, Spencer Tracy. Well, there's only so much roses and champagne a girl can resist. I know he's a lot of fun to be with, but uh... -He's a lot more. -Marriage more? I'd love to be married. -I really would. -What's the problem? It has to be right. Do you think he's right? Grace, you're the only one who can answer that one. Why should having a career make it so difficult? Maybe with you, it won't. It all depends. -On what? -The right guy. Has it occurred to you to go back to New York and find out if he is? -I wish I could. -What's stopping you. Country Girl. Jennifer Jones got the role. Not anymore. -Jennifer Jones isn't doing Country Girl ? -She can't. She's pregnant. (LAUGHING) Grace, stop dreaming. They'll never cast you. Look, Georgie is supposed to be a beat up broad. Practically in her 40's. It's exactly the kind of role I'm dying for. Rita, I'm so sick of playing ladies, I could scream. Take my advice. Forget it, and go to New York. What's it going to be? Work... Or love? -Cream and sugar? -Just black please, Edith. Thank you. What are you working on? You know perfectly well that I'm working on The Country Girl . -Are these the sketches? Mind if I look? -Alright. -But it won't do any good. -Why, they found a replacement for Jennifer Jones? No, no. But they tell me to hold off making the costumes. Grace, will you be realistic? A: M.G.M. will never loan you out again. I've told them I'd do any picture they give me if they loan me out for Country Girl . B: You're much too young for this role. But I could look older with your help. C: Bing Crosby doesn't want you. And what Mr. Crosby doesn't want, Mr. Crosby doesn't get. -Hi fellows. -Good morning, Mr. Seton. -Good morning, Grace. -Good morning. Oh, you look wonderful. -I understand Mr. Crosby is not going to read with me. -No... I'm afraid he's, um... Dennis will run the lines with you. Have you two met? Yes. You remember the move we went through? The door. I see you've found the dressing table. You've got a purse. Let's do it. The look is great. And...action. He can be pretty arrogant and insulting, can't he. Well he had no right to treat you like that. Did you tell him that? I poured it in the sink. If you don't believe me, you can go smell it. Where's the other bottle, Frank? -What other bottle? -I'm tired, Frank. Don't play peek-a-boo with me. -Where's that other bottle of syrup? -I didn't buy another bottle. Never mind. Never mind. I give up. I'm not even going to look for it. Georgie, I want to apologize. He had no right to take that... Oh stop putting on a front. -Who's putting on a front... -You're putting on a front. And you lie, you lie, you lie! Are you going back to New York? I don't see why not. You wanna leave me, don't you? At the moment, all I want is for you to get dressed so that we can get out of here. What's in New York? Who's the guy you want to get back to? Frank, I'm warning you. I'll hit you with the first thing I pick up. Now get dressed! Now why don't you go if you're in such a big hurry? Go on, go ahead. I'll take a walk, get something to eat. -That won't do your cold any good. -Let them worry about that. And I told you what you can do, too. You want me to go? Is that what you want? Yes, yes, if you're in such a great, big hurry. Go on. You've got your key? Well you keep it. I'll get another one from the hotel. And don't wake me up when you come in. Who knows, I may be having a happy dream. Cut. That's a print. -Very, very good. -Both of you. I guess it's no secret I didn't want you in this part, Miss Kelly. -No, it isn't, Mr. Crosby. -But you got it anyway. And you're wonderful in it. You really are. -Thank you. -George, never let me open my big mouth again. (LAUGHING) (ALL LAUGHING) (BEEPING) It's just a flesh wound. You'll be fine after a few days rest. -You were very lucky. -Not quite, Miss Kelly. I'm sorry, I'm losing concentration. Well you've been at this for hours. We could finish this tomorrow. Oh, I can't. I'm flying to France tomorrow. -Business or pleasure? -(LAUGHING) With Hitchcock, it's always business. I'm doing To Catch a Thief , with Cary Grant. Ah, that's terrific! Okay, you ready to go again? (SIGHS) Yes, let's try it again. M.G.M. production 342, Green Fire . Loop 233. (BEEPING) It's just a flesh wound. You'll be fine after a few days rest. -You were very lucky. -That's got it. Better. Good afternoon, Miss Kelly. You're welcome to The Capitol Hotel. We're very pleased to have you with us. Some flowers have been left for you. Oh, they're beautiful! And someone is waiting for you in the lobby. Just on your right. Oleg! Oh! (LAUGHING) Welcome. Hello. Perfect timing. -We just broke for lunch. -Mhm. It's always perfect timing for me when I'm with you. I brought a picnic basket for us. We were just filming a picnic. That's Monaco down there. And the building nearest us is the palace. -Anyone live there? -Oh yes. It comes fully equipped with a real live prince. -Do you want to meet him? -Sometime, perhaps. There's so much I want to show you, Grace. Great restaurants. Fabulous paintings. Little beaches where the water is so clear, you don't even need a mask to see the coral. GRACE: I've missed you. OLEG: Grace, from the moment I met you, I knew you were the only girl in the world for me. GRACE: It's wonderful here. GRACE: I don't want you to go out of my life again. (MEN CHATTERING) Give it to them. (CHEERS) -I wish my life could always be like this. -Well, it can be. It's really so simple. Marry me. (LAUGHING) Mrs. Kelly, you know I can really see where Grace's beauty comes from. Mr. Cassini, you are a very charming man. And Grace is right. You're also most attractive. But can I speak quite candidly? By all means. Well I'm sure that you're feelings for Grace are most sincere. But quite frankly, I feel that you're a very bad risk as a husband. -Mother! -Why is that, Mrs. Kelly? You know that Grace is Catholic. Oleg is willing to convert, Mother. There's not that much difference between your faith -and the Russian Orthodox Church, is there? -Perhaps not. But I understand that you have been married twice before? There's nothing I can do about it now. And believe me, I have learned from my mistakes. Mr. Cassini, were you faithful in your marriages? -I will be faithful to Grace. -My husband, Jack, is a racing man. And he always says that it is very foolish to bet all of your money on a horse with a poor track record. Mrs. Kelly, this is most unfair. I'm sorry if I sound heartless. But I hope that Grace will forgive me and understand. My daughter's happiness is of the utmost importance. And I want a marriage for her to a family man. -A marriage that will last a lifetime. -Naturally. I want to talk to Father about this. I'm sorry, but it won't do any good. You're father hasn't any interest in meeting Mr. Cassini. Mrs. Kelly, would you mind if I talked to Grace alone for a minute? Of course not. Mr. Cassini. Thank you for lunch. Grace, I'll see you shortly, darling. Grace, nothing has changed. -It has changed. -Your mother will come around. -No, she won't. -You're going to call it off? Rather than face your family, you're going to throw away everything we have? -I just need some time. -Time won't change anything. I'm sorry. I can't go through with it. Not right now. You fought for roles you wanted. You fought to become an actress. Why can't you fight for yourself? -For us? -I'm sorry. What are we going to do, Grace? Do you love me? I loved being with you in France. Don, this is just the first of many lunches at the Kelly house. -Well I hope so. -Yeah, you're in for some good meals. And there's the lady responsible. Let's here it for Ma, hey, come on! (CHEERING) I taught the cook everything she knows. (ALL LAUGHING) -That's true. -Shall we adjourn to the living room for coffee and champagne? Ah that's where we're having the champagne. Very good. -You're a very bright young man, Don. -Well, how do you mean? You're marrying my daughter aren't you? Lizzanne is an extraordinary girl. -Oh, I agree, but it was mostly luck, Mr. Kelly. -Don't you ever forget that. And you call me Jack, huh? Grace, so what do you think? -Do you like him? -Oh, I think he's wonderful, Lizzie. He's not a movie star or anything, but I do love him. And he is cute. (BOTH LAUGHING) He's a terrific fellow, and you're a lucky girl. I don't have a talent like you, Grace. Being married is the only thing I've ever wanted. Would you do me a favor? -Throw your bouquet my way. -You bet. (LAUGHING) -Miss Grace. It's Mr. Canter calling from Hollywood. -Oh, thank you, Forty. -Hello? -Brace yourself, Grace. I have got some wonderful news. -What is it? -Are you sitting down? -Yes. -You have been nominated for the Academy Award for The Country Girl . -What? -Now, Grace, it's not going to be that easy, we've got some very tough competition. We got Judy Garland for A Star is Born . But Grace, from now on, they are never going to be able to say that you're just a pretty face. -You did it, Grace! You showed them. -Oh, thank you, Jay. Don't thank me. You did it. Okay, bye. -May your love last forever and a day. -That's very nice. -Lizzie? -Thanks, Daddy. I know five ladies who are anxiously awaiting what is in that envelope. I'm afraid I'll stand up, whoever wins. Don't let me stand up if it's not me. The nominees for the best performance by a leading actress are: Dorothy Dandridge in Carmen Jones. Judy Garland in A Star is Born . Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina . Grace Kelly for The Country Girl . And Jane Wyman in Magnificent Obsession . And the winner is... Grace Kelly, The Country Girl . The thrill of this moment keeps me from saying what I really feel. I can only say thank you with all my heart to all who made this possible for me. Thank you. Yeah, hello? Uh huh, yeah this is Jack Kelly. Oh, well you reporters don't waste any time, do you? Yeah, of course I'm happy. Thrilled. We're only sorry that Grace and Judy Garland both couldn't have won though, you know, so they'd have a double oscar. Yeah, hey, want to hear something interesting? Grace's winning makes it three Kelly victories in a row. Two weeks ago, my son, Kal won the Single Skulls Championship at the Pan-American Games. And last week, my granddaughter, Meg, she's only nine, won a junior ice-skating championship at Hershey! So you can see that the Kelly's are batting a thousand. Oh, Daddy. (SIGHS) (KNOCKING) It's open, come in. Good morning. The New York Times, Chicago News, Washington Post. And Eric Johnson of the producer's association has already called me twice from Washington. -About what? -You know, I think you should go to the Cannes Film Festival next month. Now, I know, you already said no, but Country Girl is going to be in competition, and it would be a great change of scene for you. You might be right. Would you like me to book it by way of Philadelphia so you can stop off and see the family? No, book it straight through. -Grace, this is your gown for tonight. All right? -Yes, fine. (SPEAKING FRENCH) -Oui, Madame. -Merci. May I present Monsieur Lapinere, the Countess De Segonzac. (SPEAKING FRENCH) She came along with me. I'm going to collapse for a while, I suggest you do the same. Will you be much longer with Grace? Only a moment longer, if I may. Okay, please sit down. Now, I moved the press conference from noon to 11 tomorrow, just to be safe. Time Image expects us at 3:00 for the photo session at the Palace of Monaco. And we'll be back for the official American reception at 5:30. I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Yes, but this is a festival after all. Shall I postpone the photo session? I'll ask Pierre to call the Prince's aid. Oh, no. If the prince has agreed to the time, I wouldn't want to seem ungracious. Very well, that's settled. Pierre Galante will be delighted. I think you will enjoy it. You know, after all, the Rainier, these are the oldest reigning family in Europe. And what do I call Prince Rainier? Does he speak English? -Yes, yes he does. He was educated in England. -How old is he? -Still fairly young and attractive. Intelligent and unmarried. GRACE: My hair's still damp. What am I going to do? I can't meet the prince with wet hair. COUNTESS: Don't worry, we'll do it on the way. There's plenty of time before we get there. GRACE: You're right. Now, do I curtsey when I meet him? COUNTESS: No, just a little bow will be enough, you know. GRACE: And he does speak English? COUNTESS: Yes, he does. I told you. Don't worry, you will enjoy it. Miss Kelly. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (ALL SPEAKING FRENCH) The prince sends his deepest apologies. He's been unavoidably detained. Please, will you follow me? (WHISPERING) We didn't have to rush. We had plenty of time. There was no need to rush really. -Oh, is my hair... -Oh, fine, alright finally. Uh, Miss Kelly, the Colonel Severac feels that we should start our tour now -and your photo session. -If it's alright with you. That would be fine. I do have to be back at 5:30. I understand. I am so sorry about this situation. -Well, Jean-Paul, why don't we begin? -Yes. Miss Kelly, let's place you in front of this mirror. I think it will be charming because we...we... See like that... The room behind. -Alright. -Yes. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Okay, a little more profile. Yes, thank you. Perfect! That perfect! Thank you. C'est magnifique. Uh, excuse me, Miss Kelly, please, excuse me. Perhaps you can try and go to the fireplace? And I think it's marvelous. Yeah, thank you. Yes, it is! Wonderful. Perhaps something else if you... Yes, yes! Oh, yes. Marvelous. Thank you. Thank you, very much. -Do you have the time? -Oh, about 4:00. -We don't have much longer, you know. -So sorry. I think the prince is being very rude. -Maybe we should go now. -The delay is unavoidable. Now we try from profile, if you can. Okay? Oh. Yes! Stay like that, yes. A little longer. Lovely! Smile, smile...no. Yes! -Okay! -PRINCE: My apologies to everyone. Monsignor, may I present to you, Mademoiselle Grace Kelly. I'm very pleased to meet you, Miss Kelly. I'm so sorry not to have been here when you arrived. But then punctuality is only a virtue of kings, and I am only a prince. -Countess. Pierre. Monsieur. -Lapiniere, Monsignor. May I show you the palace then? -I'm afraid we've already seen it. -And the gardens as well, I suppose. -Yes. -Well that would seem to leave only my zoo. -You have a zoo? Oh yes. May I show you it? -I hope your photo session went well. -Yes, it was fine. I've never had the pleasure of seeing your country. Oh, I'm sure you'd find America fascinating. Yes, it's a great gap in my education. I imagine most of your work is in California. Were you born there? -No, I was born in Philadelphia. -Ah, the City of Brotherly Love. Boodi, this is Miss Grace Kelly, a very nice American. Hm? Give me your hand. (LAUGHING) Now you don't have to do this, but I assure you there's no danger. Give her your hand. (LAUGHING) Oh, he's wonderful. (LAUGHING) (MONKEY SOUNDS) -They all seem to know you. -Yes, although their being here is only temporary. They'll... Soon be a part of a new, public zoo. This is... Simba. (LION PURRING) Mm. You won't get me to do that. (CHATTER) Thank you so much for your hospitality. The pleasure was entirely mine. -I do hope you will return. -I would love to. And that it will be a little less hectic next time. How did it go with Miss Kelly? I think they got the photos they wanted. -And the girl? -She's attractive. I did encourage them to come, you know. Because she's exactly the sort of Catholic girl I should be meeting? That thought had crossed my mind. Ah, you're gonna look just stunning. I always said you looked like a princess. Now what'd I do with the other earring? Ugh, got it. Hmm, not bad for old lace curtains. (LAUGHING) -You know what this reminds me of? -The prince you met? No. A girl I was really jealous of in grade school. She got to be Cinderella. Think what it means to be a swan. To glide like a dream on the smooth surface of the lake. And never go on the shore. On dry land, the swan is awkward, even ridiculous. So there you must stay, out in the lake. Silent, light, majestic. Take me in, Albert. For the champagne, also the sherry, Peggy. Where is Forty? Look, if we put a table there with a decanter, then you won't have to go so far, Mrs. Obemeir. And we can... Perhaps people like coffee before dinner. Mother, who's coming for dinner? Darling, the Austin's are coming, and they're bringing friends. -Look, hasn't Mrs. Obemeir done a lovely job? -Yes, it's beautiful. Peggy, remind me to tell your father I want him to bring up some really good French wine. I've already done that. -Aunt Grace, Aunt Grace! -Salt's there. -Yes, Meg, what is it? -Um, this horse has fallen down from the top of the tree. -And the hook's fallen out. So, I need some help. -Oh, let's see. Ah, I see our problem. I think I can fix that. There you go. Now, where does he belong? He belongs up near the top. Okay. Let's just put him right back. (DOORBELL RINGING) Okay, how's this? That's perfect. (PEOPLE BEING GREETED IN THE DISTANCE) -He looks very good there. -Grace, we've brought a friend of yours to see you. This is a surprise. I had no idea. I thought it would be nice to see some of your country. Meg, this is His Serene Highness Prince Rainier of Monaco. Your Highness, may I present my niece, Miss Margaret Kelly Davis. Pleased to meet you, Miss. Davis. -Are you really what she said? -Yes. This is the Schuylkill River. My brother practices his rowing on it. I understand he's a champion. Yes. I think my father built our house near here so that he and Kal could practice every day. The house is very lovely. My father designed it. As a matter of fact, he helped build part of it. He started out as a bricklayer when he was young. My family started out as soldiers. With rather more ambition than scruples. For centuries ago, you gained your land by fighting for it. There's still some of that in me, and I think in you. Well, I suppose it depends on knowing what's worth fighting for. Exactly. You're the last person in the world I expected to walk through our door last night. Well I hope the surprise was a happy one. It was. Very. I love acting. I love my work. Sometimes, the attention and the... The pressure kind of gets to me. You must understand that. And the responsibility and the... Pressure that you must feel. Well people often get the wrong idea of what it's like. It's not quite as simple as they think. For example, if I take a walk through the town... Then I'm accused of being idle and not paying attention to the affairs of the country. Of course, if I'm not visible, then I'm distancing myself from them. Well I'm sure your people love you. And that is one of the peculiarities of absolute monarchy. All the people complain about everything you do and love you absolutely. We have a lot in common. (BOTH LAUGHING) Please. I am here on behalf of the prince. And uh, well, to get right to it, he is requesting your daughter's hand in marriage. Well, it seems to me the one to ask is my daughter. Well, the reason I've approached you first is that... You see, I was the one who encouraged the prince to make the trip, knowing how he felt about your daughter. But it wouldn't be appropriate for the prince to propose, and -be refused. -You'd like to know what, uh... -What I think my daughter's answer might be? -Yes, you might say that. That's not so easy. Grace is kind of a mystery to me at times. My guess is... She'd say yes. But that's all it is, a guess. Well, thank you. -Not too cold? -No, it's quiet. I wish there were more time. I'm sad to be leaving America. -It's all gone so quickly. -Hm. -Much too quickly... -Grace. Grace, I've often thought of what the woman I love would be like. I always had a picture of what she might look like. I never met her until now. You have all those qualities which I've been searching for. Even to the color of your eyes. What I'm trying to say, oh darling, Grace, is that... I love you, -and I want to marry you, if... -Yes. You'll have me. Oh yes. (PEOPLE CHEERING THE NEW YEAR) -Happy New Year. -Happy New Year. But, how do you feel about getting married? Like any other girl. Happy and excited. Do you plan on having children? -Well I certainly hope so. -Well how many children do you plan to have? A lot, I hope. I love grandchildren. (LAUGHTER) Will you be giving up your career after you marry? I have a commitment to do High Society for M.G.M. After that... Well Grace and I have not yet discussed it. There are many duties and obligations in Monaco that will occupy Grace's time, but we'll see. My. Kelly, you must be very proud having your daughter marrying a prince. Well, it's not the title that's important, it's the man that counts. -What about the prince? -You know something? He grows on you. (LAUGHTER) (ALL LAUGHING) Grace, is it true that you'll be the most titled woman in the world? -Could you tell us your titles? -I'm afraid I don't know them -all yet. -How many are there? 52. -Would you like me to name them all for you? -Thank you, Your Highness, but that won't be necessary. (LAUGHTER) -I brought you a cup of hot cocoa. -Oh, thank you, Mother. You like him, don't you? (SIGHS) Here I am, a bricklayer's wife, and my daughter is going to marry a prince. (LAUGHS) Whoo. How does Daddy feel about him? I think your father feels the same way I do. It's not the prince that I'm worried about. Oh, Mother. You don't have to worry about me. (SIGHS) Grace. You've spent the past eight years totally dedicated to your career. I want you to realize what it is that you may have to give up if it turns out that once you've become the princess, you have to give up your movie career. Then you must know that it was your choice. You must never blame him. -Oh, I love you, Mommy. -Oh, I love you too. (JOURNALISTS CLAMORING) Have you spoken with the Prince since he went back to Monaco? We try to phone each other every day? What's the first thing you'll say to him when you see him? I have no idea. I know I'll be very happy to see him. (CLAMORING) Can you make a comment about the prince's statement about your career? He said, "We have an agreement, no more movies," Have a comment about that? You must have a comment about your career, ma'am. (CLAMORING) I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse us. We're all very tired. (CLAMORING) One photo! That's right, lift your head up. Very good. Hold it, right there. Hold it right there. Good. Move back a little. Just a little. Thank you. They aren't giving you anything, so don't let them push you around. Oh, and another thing. All that... That protocol stuff. Don't let that throw you. You just... You just be yourself. Do what you want to do. Eh? Don't... I mean, you just be yourself. You know, Father, all my life I've wanted you to be proud of me. The way you were of Kal when he won at Henley. You know, you're very much like my sister, Grace, who you were named after. She was different from us. Had a world of her own. Dreams of the stage. Things that I didn't know much about. But, uh... Even though we never talk very much I became very fond of her. She was such a sweet little thing. Kind of frail, though. I guess that's why I always tried to keep an eye on her to see that she was all right and nothing bad happened to her. But, something did. She was just a little younger than you are now when she died. I loved her very much. And I never told her. Not very good at that sort of thing, I guess. But I'd sure hate for my... My daughter to go way off in the world where I couldn't keep an eye on her and not have her know that I... I know you love me. Oh, I do, Grace, I do. Very much. Warm sunlight heralds a fine day, and the little port is gaily dressed in just the right finery. The princely flag flutters elegantly in the Mediterranean breeze. The U.S.S. Constitution sails into view. What used to be the name of just another American liner has come to mean the ship that brings Grace Kelly to her Prince Charming. Thousands have gathered today to welcome the Hollywood screen queen, about to become a real, live princess by marrying Rainier of Monaco. The prince's yacht puts out to sea. In a moment, the distance will be covered. Then we'll see what we've been waiting to see, when the eyes of the world are trained on the two lovers, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier. Who saw the prince take the hand of his bride to be. It was this, the simple gesture that everybody wanted to see. On the bridge of the white yacht, the stars of this 20th century fairytale return to Monte Carlo. Miss Grace Kelly is used to public adoration. And yet she must be overwhelmed here today. She sees the yachts crowding the harbor, bearing flags from east and west, north and south. An amazing wide world greeting. And now, it's on to the ancestral home of Monaco's rulers, perched high and proud on the crest of the famous old rock. This palace will be Miss Kelly's new home. Tonight, her arrival will be celebrated in fine and joyous style. -Where are we going? -There's a little chapel in the hills. I want you to see it. I've loved it ever since I was a boy. I pray you will not miss your old life too much. That Monaco will become your home. And that you will grow to love it as I do. It's our wedding day. I'd like to exchange our vows here tonight. Privately. You are the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen. I'm so glad you're here. Aye, you think you remember all those things I told you? I'm leaving you in good hands, I know, but oh, I'm sure gonna miss you. I'll miss you too. That's our cue, huh? Ready? Rainier... (SPEAKING FULL TITLE) (SPEAKING FRENCH) (FRENCH) Oui Grace Patricia... (SPEAKING FRENCH) (FRENCH) Oui. (SPEAKING LATIN) (LATIN) Amen.
