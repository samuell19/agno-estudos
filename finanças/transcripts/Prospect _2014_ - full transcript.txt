Are you sure? Yes. Get the shovels. This is not our world. This will never be our world. We're aliens here. We are here only for the Aurelac. Nothing else. We cannot stay here. Always stay within range. The radios are the only thing that keeps us connected. Know your sectors,... ...stay in contact. Under no circumstances can you be separated. If anything happens to me,... ...take the Aurelac and take it home. Nothing's gonna happen. Do not underestimate the danger. There are others out there and they... ...all want the Aurelac. They have a lot of it. That makes us a target. We are small. We are smart. And the forest is big. But we still have to be prepared. We cannot be too careful. Where is the ship? 54, 51.3 by 78, 87.1 W "01" What? 78, 87.01 W Sorry. Say it right. 54, 51.3 by 78, 87.01 W Show me. What is the launch code? 1-5-1-Alpha-Lima-Charlie-6-6-2-Echo-Zulu-8 What do you do when you get... Strap myself in, turn on GBC's: primary & back-up,... ...initiate launch sequencer code & key. Once in orbit,... ...only communicate with government vessels. They will help me. Do not tell them about the Aurelac. If I see a non-government vessel,... ...shut down electrics and they will not find me. Very good. What are you doing? Just looking through my sketches. Your what? My sketches. I draw sometimes when you're busy. These are good. Have you always liked to draw? Yeah. Wow. Maybe we should uh... ...get you some paint or something when we get back? That'd be good, wouldn't it? Sure. Anything you want. These are really very good. So, where we at? 24. Good. So, how much have we made? 1.4 million. Almost there. Stay back... ...there's someone here. He's armed. Go to the ship. I'll meet you there. Wait. What do you wa... ...he's broken... I'm sorry. He has... Aurelac. I'm sorry... go back to the ship. No! No! No... I'm sorry. You have to leave immediately. If they made it in the sector,... ....they'll find the ship. If they haven't already. We'll have to make a split. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing? Hold your breath. What... We will find a way to get home. 2742, requesting release. I'm here to harvest. I have the location of a massive deposit of Aurelac. The Queen's Lair. Upon my estimation, it's the largest anyone's ever seen. Someone is approaching. Where are you from? Nowhere. How poetic. The Queen's Lair. Where is it? Drop it! Now this is something I have never seen... ...in all my time in the Green. A little girl. We're in the same trough, you and I. You don't have a ship? No, I don't. But you will find a way to get home. If you find that buried treasure. Why should I trust you? You're a killer. I am, indeed. But are you? I can offer protection. I say together we ravage the Queen's Lair. Even split. Of course. I sustained a wound. I was hoping you had some juice. Here is our offer. I don't understand. For the girl. That is a bold offer. ...you're gonna have to trust me. You're trying to trick me. It was all in the name of self-preservation, birdie. It was nothing personal.
