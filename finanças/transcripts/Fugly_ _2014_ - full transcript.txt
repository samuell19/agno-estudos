Just so you know why I'm doing this Vlog, I lost the woman of my dreams, the love of my life, my soul mate... And I'm going through a little bit of career menopause on top of that. So I'm having kind of a hard time and I don't see a way out. So I guess what I'm going to do is I'm going to off myself. (crowd cheering) Maybe I'll get a lot of hits. And go out that way instead of continue living this life of anonymity. (bird screeching) And I'm probably going to either do it by, I don't know, hanging myself or taking a lot of pills. (crying out in pain) Or drowning myself. Or all three, probably, just to make sure I do it right. Okay, I'm not gonna lie to you. I sabotage every relationship I'm in, every single one of them. And I don't know, I guess it's, I got anger issues. I feel like the world owes me. I definitely have self-esteem issues. Oh, that's guaranteed. 'Cause I was a ghetto nerd. I wasn't even popular in high school. I never even had an STD. See? But if you want to see me off myself, the least you could do is listen to my whole story, okay? 'Cause I'm not gonna blame my parents for all my problems. No, just the really crippling ones. Jesse: It wasn't all their fault 'cause it was the '70s-- the era of urban decay, disco dancing and free love. Well, free for everybody but me. No, I had to take care of myself. I was such a lonely little bastard. (moaning) Jesse: And I desperately wanted love, but I didn't know how. So I went to see my pops and that's when he gave me the damnedest piece of advice. It changed me forever. ...mira gran pendejo, you want to know how powerful a woman's orgasm is? It's in her sneeze. (sneeze) Jesse: Oh, by the way, that woman's not my moms, no. And when my mother found out she kicked my father's ass out all the way to Jersey. And then my Gramps became my substitute dad. And he assured me-- Love is like talent. You don't know where it comes from or what it is, but it comes. Jesse, you're lucky women don't care about looks, but you better be funny. Whoa-whoa Dean, whoa-whoa Dean! I say... I say, You're way off. You're way off this time, son. Put 'em up, put 'em up. Jesse. Shit! You're scaring people. Come inside. No one wants to kiss me, Gramps. Even Moms had to get drunk to breastfeed me. I like you, M'ijo. I just like your brother Ray better. Jesse: Oh yeah, my Moms liked my brother much better. 'Cause he had all the qualities my mother liked in men-- he was handsome, he had nice hair and he always had my back. I'm ashamed to be your brother. Jesse: Why did I have to be the loser Why did I have to be the nerdy brother? It wasn't fair. I was so sick of watching him get all the girls. So I took a more direct approach. Oh my God! (giggling) ♪ F-U-G-L-Y. You ain't got no alibi! ♪ ♪ You fugly, fugly, fugly, effin' ugly ♪ Jesse: The nickname stuck Fugly, for the rest of my life. And then eight years later I got the chance to escape the shadow of my better-looking brother and fled to college. And people, I'd done my homework. I knew that as an ambassador of Affirmative Action, I'd get into some good colleges, but nothing... nothing prepared me for Vassar. Vassar was like a Pez dispenser. Six girls to every guy, which meant that at least one of them would be into me. ♪♪♪ Oh, God, I wanted women to think I was great. (girls giggling) I wanted to exact my revenge. I wasn't going to fall in love with them but make them fall in love with me. But then I met Carol. And the saying goes that men look for their mothers in a mate and maybe it's true 'cause I found the most abusive woman on campus. She even turned out to be a Republican... Fuck me, you commie lover. Oh! ...And the president of the Latinos for Bush campaign. Pinko! Leftist pinko! Jesse: Now I'm not partisan but Latin Republicans? That's like Roaches for Raid. - Are you kidding me? Was it good for you? I've had elevator rides that lasted longer than that. (door slams) Jesse: I needed more than Carol to undo my fugliness. So I decided to look for a more sensitive type in the drama department. And since I was the only straight man of colour I got the chance to play Othello. You people will-- Down, Strumpet! Why should I fear, I know not. Guiltiness, oh, I know not. Cut! Down, Strumpet! Why? I feel! I fear! That was great. Thank you. (sneezes) Jesse: And that's when I saw Lara for the first time. ♪♪♪ It's in her sneeze. (sneezes) Hey, how about her? How about her? Her? Yeah, sure, yeah. Come on. Go on. Yeah, you. Up. Jesse: Wow, what a beautiful mess trapped in an even hotter body. And she was an uptown girl, too. Good breeding, fancy. Oh, she was different, all right, and she had everything. Okay. And... action! Go! Louder... Louder. You can do it. Talk you of killing!? Aye, I do. If it were now to die, 'Twere now to die most happy; for, I fear, my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown faith. Why should I fear... I know not! Since guiltiness, I know not! I feel I fear! (sporadic clapping) Awesome. That was so great. Cut. Jesse: Like I said, she had everything... everything but talent. But I didn't care. Hey, it gave me a chance to chat her up. No, God, and I know I'm a horrible actress, by the way. But that's great. The world needs more horrible actresses who know they're horrible. You know how many actresses that think they're amazing but they're really horrible? - Oh, wait no. No, no, no. No, I do not want to be an actress. You don't want to be an actress? No. I'm just doing this because my mom thinks I have these confidence issues, which, by the way, she gave me. Why am I telling you this? I'm... Why did you start acting? Oh, man, I don't know. I was a kid and my mom, every time I met somebody new she'd always go, "Act like you're not my child." - Oh, come on. - Yeah. I thought I had an inferiority complex. Now I realize that it was just good judgement. It doesn't look like it. Like what? It just doesn't look like it. What do I look like? Honestly? Yeah. I would say, birth order, second child. Spent a lot of time indoors. Yeah. Didn't get attention from the opposite sex and so you used humour as a way to compensate. Uh huh. And definitely penis envy. Oh, hey, hey, now, now. Now you got to stop that. If you're gonna be straight up like that I'm not gonna be able to hang with you. Who said I wanted to hang? (singing in Spanish) Jesse: And that's when I discovered that she was the queen of contradictions. Oh, yeah. Lara: Oh yeah. (moaning) (sneezing) Jesse: Oh, that sneeze. That mucozoidal symphony of Lara's set the course for the rest of my life. Cop: Romeo! Get your ass off a Juliet and get outta this car! Jesse: Okay, so the night didn't turn out so perfect. But, we didn't care. To the left now. No, we made the most of it. Can we get one together? Jesse: God, I was so into her. Isn't it cool? - Yeah. Isn't it cool just to do stuff for the fuck of it? I did something expressly for the fuck of it and look where it got me. Oh, come on. This is the best date I've ever had. Lara? I'm very disappointed. Your mother is coming home early from the ashram. - Sir? I'm... I'm Jesse Sanchez I'm not paying your bail, Mr. Snatchez. Wow, is that your dad? Yeah. Holy cow. No wonder you got confidence issues. Come on. Let's get out of here. Let's go to Denny's. We'll celebrate with a side order of bacon. We're going home, Lara. Lara? Come on, let's go. Jesse? Yeah? I really like you. I like you too. That was like a really fun night. Yeah, wasn't it? But I think... I mean, I know, we're just too different. ♪♪♪ Jesse: I couldn't believe Lara had left me. So I wrote her a million letters trying to get an answer, but they were all returned. God, I felt crushed. I felt so broken I needed to expose my pain so I just focused on my art. Cut! What the fuck is it... I don't understand, man. How is this loneliness? What is alone? Is it playing a cello? Jesse: But eventually the collegiate abstraction just left me feeling ignorant. So I chose to act for a more honest and vocal crowd. (screaming) But children's theatre could only fulfill me so much. (screaming) I kept hopelessly looking for Lara in all of my leading ladies. Jesse, what are you doing? You're wasting your life, you know that, and your time. Forget about her. Jesse: Hm. She was finally right. And you know, Lara wasn't the woman I was supposed to end up with. She was just the woman I happened to fall in love with. We were like West Side Story. She was rich, I was poor, but neither one of us could sing or dance about it. ♪♪♪ Jesse: It was the best sex I ever had in my entire life. It was. I mean, for the first time in my life I didn't feel fugly. (Gibberish) Jesse: But I had to move on. So I went back to performing. (gibberish) What kind of a place is this? It's too close. Jesse: Hey, at least my family showed up... even if it was to watch me fail. (crying) (applause) I have an exaggerated sense of my own unimportance. And I don't think it's just me either. I think all Latin people, we have a collective low self-esteem. I think it must have started back when our whole culture got destroyed. I mean, it must have started when my great-great-great- Conquistador grandfather, who must have been like, “I'm going to better your blood, Incan slut.” And my great-great-great Incan grandmother was like-- (crying baby sound) “Excuse me, what's wrong with my blood? Is it watery? Is it low in iron? And you certainly ain't man enough to fix it for me.” Jesse: (slaping sound effect) (boing sound effect) “Who's not man enough now, Indian slut? I'm going to colonize you.” “Oh, no, no. Can you please take my land, take my gold, just don't stop.” “Who's your king? Who's your king? Huh!? Huh!? I know imperialism is bad but it feels so good! Ay coño... coño, cup my pink, fuzzy little balls. Oh...” (laughing) Dude, that didn't suck? How could I trust the opinion of a guy who thinks Tennessee Williams is a state capital, huh? Oh, you know what? Fuck it, it sucked. You should get a better actor to play you. Honestly? Put more of that sex stuff in. More sex stuff? I ejaculated on stage. What are you talking about? It's like Inca stuff, Indians, they don't want that. They want hot chicks, BJs, that kind of stuff. You know, whoever said, "A mind is a terrible thing to waste," was talking about you. By the way, Moms and Gramps had to split. That chick with the bush freaked them out. Hello! Funny man, let me shake the hand that wrote those lines. I don't know if you want to shake this hand, it's done a lot of other nasty things. Stoddard Lowenstein. Stoddard. I'm Ray. Hi, Ray. I'm a Pisces. Thank you, Ray. It was pretty good. Needs a little bit of work. Oh, really? See, the nicest thing I heard all day. And I hear there's this big Latino invasion going on. So I need a client that could compete with “Benicio Del Taurus”. Who's that? Shut up. I think I can change your life. Call me. Ray: Hey, Stoddard. Yes? I'm gonna make a difference in you. I'll be waiting. Asshole! You should have told me that Stoddard Lowenstein was gonna be here. Jesse: And that's when I met the woman that was going to make me forget everything that was wrong in my life-- Zowie. I think I'm gonna stay and watch. Jesse: She was what the weather channel would call a force of nature. Penetrated. Feline. Pussy cat. Fear my lioness. Yes! Queen of the jungle! Screams of the jungle! Blood! No male fears! You never cum. She was the most passionate of performers. Again...! Yeah. Yeah! Wow! Wow. Incredible word-smithing. You're political and movement.

Not with these blue eyes and blonde highlights, I'm not. Oh no, then you're right, you're a self-hatin' Latin woman. No. I'm a self-preserving Latin woman. Oh, come on, you're Latin. You know it only takes a drop. Come on, can you dance without music? Yeah, but... Do your friends tell you to stop screamin' when you're actually just talking? Uh huh. Right, see? Can you get to your house blindfolded because the smell of sazon in Manteca is so strong? (laughs) Yeah, but... See? You're either really fly for a white chick or my favourite genre of female. Come here... Stoddard. What about her? She has to represent me, too. Yeah? Yeah. I'm gonna be a famous actress come hook or by crook. Not a problem. You think I'm fuckable? Oh, hell, yeah. Good. 'Cause it's very important in this business. Okay. Jesse: Zowie was my cure for Lara even though she was the most selfish and self-centred woman I'd ever met, but it was exactly what I needed. I know what's best for you. You just be funny. Trust me and give me ten percent. Okay. Okay. That's fine with me, but I gotta ask you something. I know it's a little inappropriate, but can you represent my girlfriend, too? For twenty percent. ♪♪♪ Oh, strange place. Oh, God. Please don't judge me by my relatives, okay? There he is.

You turn left, hippo! I... can't... get... up! I can't even breathe. (breathing heavily) Now hippopotamuses aren't all bad, but I wasn't meant to live with one sitting on my face. Jesse: I wasn't afraid of hippo or intimacy, so I stuck it out with Zowie ‘cause she was determined to make me a star in my first made-for-TV movie. Well, as long as she could be the superstar. Well, how's the pay? Thirty? Thirty dollars? One sec... thirty K! Okay. All right. You're right. That is meaningful. One second, please. (whispers) Ask about me. Yeah, I'm listening, Okay I'll do it.

I know how you feel man, I know. (laughing) Oh, my head. I'm sorry, bro. You didn't think I was serious, did you? What? ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Um... Hi. Okay, come here. Come here, before I throw up. (laughs) Where? Just follow me. Where are we going? Come on. ♪♪♪ You want children, I want children. I'm talking about responsibility and stability and maturity in a relationship and... (phone rings) A mature love that we really deserve-- Jesse (answering machine): Hey, Lara. I feel like I made a huge mistake. And I was wrong and I'd like to see you. Can you please video chat with me. Can you sign on? I need to talk to you. I'm just feeling kind of... I don't know, I feel stupid... I made a huge mistake pushing you away-- Don't answer that, please. This could be the last chance we have to talk. Please. I know, it's the last voice you want to hear, but I really need to see you. I beg you, please. I think I should go. Are you serious? I should probably... well Really!? Well, you heard what he said. Can we just... can we hold, like, one minute? What? Lara. Look, ah, you look so great. Oh my God. Look, hey, I made a terrible mistake. I just want you to know, I made the dumbest mistake of my entire life. Now is not a good time, Jesse. Mind your business, okay, Jeffrey. Stay out of it. We're kind of in the middle of something, Jesse. I can't live without you. I don't want to live my life if I can't have you. I know it sounds like a song. I need you so desperately, please Lara. Please come back to me. Will you take me back? I pushed you away because well, I wanted you to be happy with him. But I changed my mind. I rather... I'm not that kind of a guy. I'd rather you be miserable and be with me than be with him. (sighs) Look, Jesse I can't do this. I need to be in a grown-up relationship, okay? I know you need a grown-up. I'm ready for that. I'm a stupid, childish, idiotic man. But I love you. Doesn't that mean anything to you, Lara? How can I forget the best times of my life, the best one in my entire life? You dumped me! Okay? You dumped me, right? Look, I know I was stupid. I was an idiot. I made some horrible mistakes. I pushed you away. I was horrible to you. But I know... I know. I need you, Lara. I need you in my life. You had your chance and you blew it. No, don't say that, Lara. Don't say no. Don't say no. Give it... give it a shot. And you don't know what you're saying. It's a blatant attempt for attention. Can't you see that? You think this is a ploy for attention, Jeffrey? Yes. Jeffrey, goddamn you. It's okay. He's unstable right now. Just give me one minute, okay? Is that a dog leash? I'm ready. What is this? It's like a bad reality show. Get down. If you go with Jeffrey, look, I'm gonna jump, Lara. I'm gonna end it all. You see that? I'm serious. Get down. Hey, mind your business. Jesse! Gah! ♪♪♪ Huh? Oh. Oh. I died for your sins. You know it. You owe me. Why can't we all love each other. Welcome to the last circle of hell for those who quit the game of life. Mr. Satan, I didn't really mean to quit the game of life. I just thought I'd do her a favour. Shut up! Your death lacked conviction. (laughing) ♪♪♪ Uh? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! ♪♪♪ Huh? What the hell are you doing, Jesse? I know, I was thinking the same thing. Listen, I know, life is a bunch of crap. And, yes, relationships are difficult. But you can't avoid them, Jesse. I know you're very much in love with that girl. I mean, I don't blame you. But whether you deserve her or not, who gives a shit? Just get hold of her and don't let go. But, Gramps, it's too late. I broke my promise. I can't be her deathbed test now. That's enough! Okay. Don't screw up again, coño . Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Oh my... my God. Jesse, are... are you okay? Jesse? He's not that good an actor. Somebody call 911! Jesus! Taxi. I need a taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Avenue D and Seventh. Ray, go and take a piss. You say something? Go and take a piss! Move. Move. Move. Move. ♪♪♪ No! Wake up. Please wake up. Please wake up, bro. You're all I got, bro. Hit him again. Hit him again. Anything? Nothing. What have you got? Nothing. Can you go a little faster? ... Twenty eight, twenty nine, thirty. Hit him. Take his pulse. Nothing. All right one more time. Here we go. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Here. Here. Where's Jesse!? Whoa. There we go. There we go. Come on. Come on. Ray! I... I gotta get to Lara. I gotta... gotta get Lara. No, you gotta... you gotta relax, bro. I'm gonna make it up to you, man. I'm gonna make everything up to you. Lara: Jesse! You asshole! Lara, I'm so glad to see you. You're my deathbed test. I saw myself, Lara. Shh. It's okay. I saw my Gramps and he was un-real too. And then I met Satan. Oh, my god, it was terrifying. And then... ♪♪♪ Jesse: You know, it's like James Joyce once said, "Mistakes are portals of discovery". What I learned from my giant wormhole size mistake, all of these fucked up moments added together are my life and I better milk as much happiness from them as I can. I know nothing completes me. I know I'm going to be imperfect 'til the day I die, but I'm okay with that. Now, if I can get Lara on that same program, if we both know that in this relationship our bread is going to fall on the buttered side, that we're going to spill wine on our nicest, whitest suits that someday we're going to step on dog shit, in this relationship, then we're golden. Then we're gonna be fine. Then we're gonna get through this and so will you. ♪♪♪ (moaning) Lara: (sneeze) Oh my God. Oh my God. Jesse: I'm sorry. I can explain everything. Here.
