What? A date with a woman in that village a long time ago I was cute Be careful, I think you ’re an insider Shoot if you shoot Are you still in the village? Probably What? can not understand Separate the hands and check the tent and truck I watch the surroundings You're the dead body All right Who? Are you serious? To there Sit down This woman? Why in the tent? What is she? "Don't go down" What is that woman? The prisoner in the tent I got my finger cut off Why don't you kill me It's a civilian 3 people look around Right now! Clerk What is your mission? stop What is our mission? A simple question Kill all the humans in the enemy camp Collect the materials This woman was also in the enemy camp Yeah but she... Shoot and kill Pull out the gun and shoot this woman I feel responsible for my brother's death But she's irrelevant Shoot as I was told Command is absolute There is someone over there How many enemies are there? Apparently there are at most 3-4 people Ask Walker for rescue Roger that It ’s a fierce shootout that calls for rescue right away. This one too It is a strategy change Gather in a helicopter Rescue does not come You're a lie Come on! hurry up! Fucking bastard We are the same let's go I'll run away Over here What? Nothing apart If you have something to say Nothing Really? What did you say To whom? That prisoner woman Kia spoke What story? "Don't go down" Is it your mama? Stop Wait, lie There are stairs Let's go quickly There is quite a lot to the top floor Fine? I forgot about the past I can't forget Don't worry, it's true Is it just me? It doesn't arrive even if it goes up Are you okay? I wait here No good I have a bad feeling me too Are you all okay? Are you all safe? It's settled Look at someone I go No Calm down Power problems Buxton? Buxton! Shit what? No good Don't go down Run Go up! Is that no good either? Wireless communication What's happening God's work God is trying Don't say silly She is right When did you become pious? Because of my first mission when I was 19 years old If you were escorting the prisoners --- Surrounded by convoys by the rebels I was caught with the prisoners too It took 5 months to escape Behind their hideout –– There was a clock tower with a long staircase They are every day Everything was scattered on the stairs Like broken glass or safety pins We took off our shoes... Walked on it Repeat over and over again All day long I was told that I was a soul judge So no doubt This is punishment What? Kill the prisoners Don't talk silly Thinking about the current situation There will be danger every few minutes I have to run away First I'll find the exit Don't talk useless that's an order Let's go up I feel like I'm climbing the same stairs all the time Even if you reach the top It looks like I'm back down There is an exit Hold the gun With an enemy? Already one person was killed What is this? No way now... Stop it, no impossible That's right After all it may be punishment I can not do it Go down Don't say stupid What should I do? I do not understand But below is dangerous Why do you know it is dangerous? I feel I'm sorry --- Believe in God better than you Stop it Ryan Certainly I swore loyalty But it ’s not going to hell This song again My mother sang when I couldn't sleep I can't sleep It's a creepy song what will you do? Let's go up Until when? eternally? Thought to me Try talking You should run away before that let's go So what? I'm just beginning to see Are you going to hell soon? Ford is noisy Mostly about prisoners The date and place of detention are written That woman is from Calcars It seems like I was restrained for a long time aside from that? The instruction "Do not kill her" Her synonym is also listed What? "The Prophet of Death" Local superstition I think you can understand it without explaining This situation is obviously related to her death What? Kia Is it my fault? I apologize If you say too much I'll kill you Stop Stanton Shut up Garrett Everyone, set the clock Nolan and Walker watch over the door Everything else is reconnaissance reconnaissance? Do you get it Same as usual training It's a situation that doesn't make sense. There's no need to stay on the stairs Let's find a solution Ford comes with me What? can not understand What if you don't come back? Walker? listening? What's wrong? Don't come Emma Lower the gun Please drop the gun early Listen to the story! Lower the gun Walker! Come to help Please Walker! What about Walker? I have to go! Need a strategy This is different from training I know Really What is it then? Obviously supernatural power is working That power seems to want to stop our actions in the past I want to save the prisoners what will you do? do nothing eh? Wait, I don't understand what you mean do nothing? I should have decided to die when I took on the mission Once on the battlefield every danger awaits Will This is not the battlefield No, it ’s the battlefield My mission was to kill people in the enemy camp and collect information Mission completed If you are destined to die here That kind of contract Dan's death was a disaster But don't drag too much Your judgment will slow down My brother's death is my responsibility Prioritized emotions over missions Either way my brother may have died But even now, every time I close my eyes The moment my brother died crosses my head I just regret Younger brother wasted For something big We are disposable pieces anyway Just follow the instructions I understand your feelings Can Nolan go first? I have a leg injury, so it takes time to walk go Harris, stop it I'll kill you That's probably right This fucking guy Wake up Stop it already I'll go Standing I can't go Don't be stupid, stand up Save the prisoners Correct the past-- The future should change No, I can't leave let's go Who else has limited legs? Don't pick your finger within 24 hours Really angry It ’s torture as Walker says. Let me rest a little I ’ve been out twice I returned to the same past both times Do you remember where you were at that time? I divided myself and watched around Attack from the left So run to the right and in front of the tent How can Clark avoid killing prisoners? Just tell the past about the circumstances What if a man just like you suddenly appears? I'll kill you exactly You don't have to touch yourself in the past Our ambush fails if we inform the enemy What if the enemy killed me? Come on It ’s like “Back to the Future” I like the third work Ignore the present I can't think of another good strategy If you scare your enemies, they may escape from there. What are you waiting for? If nobody is gone, let's go home I think it's impossible Unbearable for a long time on the battlefield without supplies and rescue Am I left? There are no exceptions for everyone No Just drive them away Separate the hands and check the tent and truck I watch the surroundings You're the dead body Who? This woman? What are you doing? I confirmed my finger Why does my finger return? Something might have changed What is that woman? Nothing has changed Clerk What is your mission? stop What is our mission? A simple question It's time already What is your strategy? Not particularly Shoot Stanton? No, all will survive Is that possible? Command is absolute I have to go back to the door If you start running, you will be shot But I have to go Shoot the ground only once Someone is over there go My legs are dangerous I'm worse I'll try again Now let's go back and help the prisoners There is time between when an enemy soldier gets up and when he attacks Let's enter a tent while attracting with a gunshot I Nolan is impossible, and two people lack in preparation and training Shut up and leave it to me What if I can't make it? That's right Wait until you return now My back was shot May breathe What is that woman? The prisoner in the tent I got my finger cut off Why don't you kill me What is your strategy? Same as before Help Ford after driving away with a gun Command is absolute There is someone over there stop it Nolan and the two of us go back together How many enemies are there? Apparently there are at most 3-4 people Ford standing Look! I'll go How about two people? hurry up! let's go Die if you don't pick up bullets I have to stop bleeding Bite this Believe sorry Hang in there finished I won't hold it for a long time unless I see a doctor What is your strategy? There Ford firmly Otherwise I'll die This strategy does not work shut up He's right Then, another good idea? If you reach the helicopter Escape from here and help Ford If we die on the battlefield in the past, we will disappear No abnormalities Fine? Pitiful guys Let's stop him Still not possible now Which one? I'm back again Thought to fail Noisy! stop! Are you listening? Damn it! Let's move I'll regret it if I take it off Right But I'll take it off Now try a different method What is that woman? The prisoner in the tent I got my finger cut off Nolan? Two people look around Right now! Pull out the gun and shoot this woman Shoot as I was told I've besieged, release the prisoners You can negotiate with this Who are you? If you don't release the prisoners, you'll kill all It ’s a lie to be surrounded If it ’s true, I ’m already dead Do you get it So what is your request Release the prisoners and leave Then don't kill Unfortunately... Command is absolute Quickly I don't know how long I will hold Good luck For what? To challenge The prisoners were destined to die I'm sure we too It's the worst Maybe already dead You must have thought about it once I said Walker was torture... Here is hell Someone is over there Why don't you kill me It's a civilian I'll stop I can't stop it Is that so? Two people go You can get out of here if you save the prisoners This hell never ends Absolutely I'll finish Where did you do it? I was in the enemy I brought it Now i know why Nolan may be right I won't die The worst strategy Right I'm sure there is another way forget To the container Save them if possible Join the helicopter It ’s going to be a battle I want to help as many people as possible What is that woman? Pull out the gun and shoot this woman Shoot as I was told Someone is over there What are the materials? Is that all? I don't know Kill all the enemies what are you doing? Lower the gun First aid and return to duty The important thing is to act correctly rather than command Now i know It will be the worst ending Doesn't work Do not remove I won't remove it Come with me Good? It is a strategy change Gather in a helicopter It's all right now Do not worry Should be fine Who are you "Save the civilian" command It's not a taxi Begging because it's okay There are others, wait a moment Wait only 2 minutes It was safe Can I rent a car? Do whatever you want lost sight of What about Stanton? I'm dead Why is that woman? New order, take her with you Watch your fingers what are you doing? Let's go early Kia what are you doing go You heard? go The traitor! Kia You are expelled from the unit Why such a manet? The instruction was wrong Keep silent Stanton! This fucking guy Quickly Where are you? Radio returned Is the civilian safe? Everyone is on a helicopter Go already I can't go Back to help No go Command Okay, good luck Did you correct the mistake? Yeah If there is a way to stop the battle... The battle never ends So be Very cold Right Do you remember the song that mom sang? I was saved by that song What is the headquarters? Speak honestly Stanton shot Clark I unavoidably shot him No materials found, rescued civilian POW Wait, lie There are stairs Let's go quickly There is quite a lot to the top floor
