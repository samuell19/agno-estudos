All right. [sigh] Almost done. Oh. Pickles. Here you go, boy. All right. Okay, how many pancakes you want? - Six. - Ten. Ten pancakes? Ten? Say two. Say "I would like two pancakes, please." You know they always ask for more than they can eat. - Yeah. - Give me-- All right, I'll see you guys in a couple of hours. I love you. Oh, what do you guys want to do this afternoon? - The park. - The zoo. How about the beach? - The beach. - I'm in for the beach. And what do you want to do tonight? Tonight should be me and you and a bottle of wine. You want to go out to dinner? Mrs. Gilberts said that she'd watch the kids. I want to stay home with the kids. Game night. - Yes. - Game night. Well, you're a cheap date. Hey, the wine can't be cheap. Okay. Would you like a pancake for the road? Yes, I would like ten, please. All right. Have a good ride. I was told my wife's here-- Kaylene Larson. Uh... Oh, there's her doctor now. Doctor, is she okay? Uh, Drew Larson, Kaylene's husband. Oh. Kaylene Larson. Let me s-- Yes. She's-- She's okay. She has a concussion, a fractured leg, bruised ribs, broken finger, and road burn, but all things considering, she's pretty lucky. Can I see her? Of course. She's in room 204. Go right down the hallway. Last one on the left. Thank you. Hey. Hey. I guess we're not going to the beach today, huh? Or the zoo. Oh. Babe, they made me cut my wedding ring off. It's okay. We'll get a new band. Are the kids okay? They're fine. They're with Mrs. Gilberts. I don't want them to see me like this. Are you okay? You have no idea how scary it was getting that phone call. I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. Just get better. I love you. I love you, too. Sorry to interrupt. Um, that's okay. I'm going to call the airline, let them know what's happening. Okay. I should be able to get cell phone reception somewhere in the hospital. I'll be right back. Okay. So, officially, I'm Vanessa. I'm one of your nurses. Hi. How are you feeling? I'm tired now. But I guess the doctor says I'm lucky. You certainly are. Just try and relax. You're in good hands. So that was your husband, huh? He's handsome. He says he works for an airline. Is he a pilot? Mr. Larson. Detective Dawkins. Can we talk? Yeah, of course. I spoke to your wife earlier this morning. She has no memory of what happened to her. Why did you talk to my wife before speaking to me? Because I'm investigating a crime and I don't need your permission. So tell me, Mr. Larson, what were you doing this morning while your wife was out biking? I was home with the kids. What do you do for a living, Mr. Larson? I'm a commercial airline pilot. So you're away from home several days at a time. That's right. Put up in one of those nice hotels with all the pretty flight attendants. I don't know where this is going, but I'm 100% faithful to my wife. Your wife have any enemies? - Enemies? - Mm-hmm. No. What does she do? She does marketing for a nonprofit-- Wounded Warriors. Everybody loves her there. D-Do you really think this was deliberate? Hmm. There's nobody on that road at that time of day. Excellent visibility. Your wife is wearing bright clothing. There's no skid marks. So no one even tried to hit a brake before the collision. So either your wife is a target, or she's the most unlucky person I've ever met. Well, are there any witnesses? Uh, did somebody get a plate number or-- Nobody that we've been able to find so far. We don't even know how long she was lying there unconscious before the joggers found her. Look, I can't think of a single person that would want to hurt her. - No one? - No one. No one at the job, family conflict, some neighbor? No. Not anybody. Would you do me a favor, Mr. Larson? If you think of something, no matter how insignificant it may seem, give me a call. Thank you, detective. They all miss you so much. I think even Pickles is depressed that you're not around. Baby, get me some Jell-O. Absolutely. Your appetite's back. That's good. Sounds so good. [both laughing] Well, somebody is loved. Oh. So cute. How many kids do you have? Oh, we have twins-- Zoey and Toby. Mm. That's got to be so much fun-- fun-slash-exhausting. Oh, you must have some kids, too. Oh, kids? No. You married? My husband was killed in action in Afghanistan. Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. Uh, no. I'm-- I'm sorry. I-- I shouldn't have told you that. Sometimes it's just easier to talk to strangers about things, so-- I hope you won't consider me a stranger for much longer. It's hard to consider you a stranger when you've seen me with this gown off. [both laugh] You know, it's all part of my job. Drew: Hey, check it out. Strawberry, lime, orange, and black cherry. Four different flavors of gross. You should be able to start eating real food soon. Uh, any numbness or tingling in your toes or fingertips? - No. - Hmm? - Mm-mm. - Good. All right. I'll be by to check on you later. All right. Hey, have you guys thought about what you're going to do for home care? I was going to go to Discharge Planning to find out about a home health aide. Can I be honest? - What? - Yeah. I wouldn't. Well, the doctor was just saying that-- - That you'll need somebody. - Drew: Yeah. He's right. But what I'm saying is, with your situation, uh... Look, can I be honest with you? - Please. - Sure. Do you know how long it takes to become a home health aide? It's a six-week course. - They teach them how to-- - Drew: Wow. ...take blood pressure and wipe a tush. Done. You know, with young kids, and especially how serious your injuries are, I'd get a nurse. Babe. Well, can you recommend a nurse? What, you? If you'll have me. Wait. Can you do that while you're working here at the hospital? I'm only registry, so I can come and go as I please. I'm just covering for someone on maternity leave. And you want the job? - What do you think? - I think we have a nurse. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Great. All right. Well, we'll be in touch. Enjoy your Jell-O. This is the kitchen, obviously. Uh, the pool and the living room. It's a beautiful home. Thank you. Uh, Toby, Zoey, come here. - Daddy. - Hey, guys. Guys. Ohh. And this is your mother's nurse Vanessa. We talked about this, right? She's going to be staying with us until Mommy feels better. Hi. I'm Zoey, and this is my brother Toby. Hi. It is very nice to meet you both. And these two promised me that they would be on their best behavior while you're here. Right? And then we each get a toy. Oh Only if you're good. How long are you going to be here? [chuckle] I mean, don't take that the wrong way. They're just trying to calculate how many days of good behavior are ahead of them. They're smart, huh? I guess, but do not trust these innocent faces. These two are shrewd operators working the system. All right, guys, who wants to show Vanessa to her room? I will. Come on, Vanessa. We even clipped a flower from Mommy's garden and put it in your room. [gasp] That is very sweet of you. - Thank you. - Here, I'll take that. Toby, I thought we talked about you leaving your toys on the floor. Sorry. That's okay. Come on. Ow. Ow. I hope the kids don't bother you too much. They have a lot of energy. It's good, though. They hang out next door at Mrs. Gilberts' house. She's so sweet. She takes care of them when I'm working, and I feel like there's other things I should be telling you, maybe, about the house. Oh, the thermostat-- Kaylene, I'll figure it out. - Okay. - More importantly, how are you feeling? You ready for your medication? - Yeah, I guess. - Good. And you just need to be patient. Healing takes time, and your body needs to rest. These will help with the pain, but they'll also help you sleep. Okay. All these? Can you grab the kids for me so that I can hang out with them a little bit - before I fall asleep? - Of course. Oh, hey, is she okay enough to read to the kids? She is officially out like a light. You are such a bad girl. It's hard to concentrate. You're doing great. Is that her? Well, if that's you, then that's her. Let me see. I could get so fired for this. Ooh, you've been such a good boy. Now it's my turn to take care of you. You just keep your eyes on the screen... and I'll take care of the rest. Close your eyes. Oh, yes. Take control. I'm down for that. You look like you could use this. Ohh. - Yes. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. It was not a good night. What happened? Oh, she just-- she couldn't get comfortable. Just tossing and turning. She elbowed me in the face. Oh. Well, I'll see if we can up her meds a bit. In the meantime, why don't you stay in the extra guest room? You know, just until she gets back to her regular sleeping pattern. I don't think she'd be happy with that. Maybe not, but I don't think your passengers would like a pilot falling asleep in the cockpit. You're probably right about that. Mm-hmm. No, honestly, it would be easier for me to tend to Kaylene at all hours of the day and the night if she were in her own room. Well, if you can convince her of it, I am all for it. - Can't get me. - Gonna get ya. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! Why aren't you guys dressed? Miss Thompson's coming over to take you to school. There's no school today. I cut you some apples. Oh, parent-teacher conferences. Uh, all right. I will call Mrs. Gilberts and see if she can come over and-- Don't bother. I got it. No. You got your hands full with Kaylene. I'm happy to take care of them. - You sure? - Absolutely. Thank you so much. Mm-hmm. When's Mommy coming out? Your mommy just needs to stay in bed for a few more days, sweetie. But I want to see her. Me, too. Mommy needs to get her rest for a few more days. We'll go and see her later, okay? Oh, God, I got to go. Uh, they will pick out their own clothes and tell you what they want to eat. Um, one hour of TV max. They can feed the dog, but just make sure they close the gate so the dog doesn't get out. Bedtime is at 8:00 sharp, and do not let them convince you otherwise. We got it under control, right, guys? - Right. - Right. Thank you so much. I will see you guys tomorrow afternoon. Mwah! Mwah! I love you. Bye. Bye. Well, kiddos, looks like it's just the three of us. How much longer? Uh, let's see. Seven more minutes. Aw. Ohh. You two are just like me. Mm-hmm. I can't wait for cookies, either. Do you want to see what they look like? Both: Yeah. [beep] Mm. Don't they look delicious? - Yeah. - [chuckle] [doorbell rings] I'll get it. Nobody touches that oven. Can I help you? Hi. I'm Samantha. I'm here to see Kaylene. Oh, it's not really a good time. She's sleeping right now. Hi, Auntie Samantha. Hi, guys. Come here. Ha ha ha ha! Get over here! Oh! [laughing] This is Mommy's nurse. And we're baking peanut butter cookies. Really? Well, I had no idea it was in a nurse's job description to bake cookies. Just helping out wherever I can. Hm. Well, I am gonna go see your mommy, and then I will come back and hang out with you guys. I promise, promise, promise, okay? - Okay. - Okay. [knocking] Knock-knock. You okay? Are you asleep? Oh, whoa. What is going on around here? This is...okay. That's too bright. Okay. Don't take this the wrong way, but you kind of look like hell. I was in an accident. Yeah. I know. I was at the hospital with you every single day, remember? Oh, yeah. That was sweet of you. Thank you. Mm-hmm. I think I'm a little out of it. Yeah. I know. What's this? That's the guy. I'm supposed to call him if I remember anything. I don't remember anything. Of course you don't, not in this condition. How many pills are you taking? All those. Yeah? I'm just gonna take a little nap for-- a quick nap. Okay. Come on. I'm gonna help you. [sigh] Okay? Yeah. Okay, real slow. Oh, yeah. Ohh. I'm sorry. That is so brutal. So what's up across the hall? Is that where she's sleeping? No, that's where Drew's sleeping for a little bit. What? Why? Uh, he's just, you know-- he said I'm not that easy to sleep next to. Look, you know what? You are going to feel so much better after a bath, I promise you. Just forget it. This is the first time that I didn't feel like crap in a very long time. - Aw. - Mm-hmm. So how much do you know about this woman? - Vanessa? - Yeah. She was my favorite nurse in the hospital. She's so attentive. Okay, but what about her family? I mean, how could she just drop everything and move in like this? I don't think she has any family. Her husband died in Afghanistan. Whoa. It's awful. You know what? I'm gonna take some time off work, and I'm gonna help out around here. No, you're not. You have that whole big venture capital thingie. That venture capital thingie is done on Wednesday, so yes, I can help. No, you're not coming over here and helping with stuff, you weirdo. I don't like Vanessa down there baking cookies with Toby and Zoey. She's so good with the kids. I feel horrible I can't hang out with them right now, and Drew can't take any more time off work. Okay, well, how long is she going to be here? I don't know. Maybe a couple weeks. - More importantly-- - Mm. ...when are we going to bedazzle that cast? Hmm? No. Don't say bedazzle. Vanessa, is it? If you wouldn't mind washing her hair just a little more often. It's hard to start feeling better when you look that terrible. Oh. Okay. Thanks. Samantha, is it? Kaylene needs time to rest and heal, and no amount of soap or make-up is going to speed that along. And keeping her so doped up that she can't carry on a conversation? Is that also part of your healing process? It's called pain management. Would you rather she suffered? Hey, Auntie Samantha, want to try one of our cookies? Ohh. Honey, I would love to, but you know I'm allergic to peanuts. Huh. Oh, this looks so delicious. You know what? I am going to color. Okay. What should I draw? What are you guys making? That's me, that's Toby, that's Daddy, and that's Vanessa and Pickles. Oh. Where's your mommy? Right here in bed. That makes me really sad that she's way down in the corner like that. Vanessa told us we need to keep quiet so we can let her sleep. Really? You know what? It's absolutely true. She does need to rest. But do you know what the best medicine is? All of the hugs and kisses you can give her. - Really? - Ha ha ha ha! Well, not exactly. Are you seriously telling me that these children can't spend time with their mother? Not at all. But I have been hired to nurse Kaylene back to health, which means ensuring that she gets plenty of uninterrupted rest. I forgot something in the bedroom. I will be right back. What have we got here? Kaylene, we really need to-- Vanessa: A cookie hamburger. What would be in it? Icing? Hey, guys, I got to go, and I really want to give you kisses like always, but I can't because of that darn peanut butter. So I am going to blow you kisses. Mwah and mwah. And maybe this weekend I will take you somewhere fun. Both: Yay. Bye. Please call first next time. Actually, Vanessa, I'll drop by whenever I want because this ain't your house, and this isn't your family. Have a nice day. Bitch. "Then the fox said to the little mouse, 'I know a short cut through the groove'." Grove. Grove. "Follow me through the grove." Right. Sorry. "'Follow me, and I will show you to my pen'." - Den. - Den. - Mom. - Oh, sorry, sweetie. It's a little bit blurry for me right now. Vanessa doesn't make any mistakes when she reads to us. Yeah, and she makes funny animal noises to all the animals, too. I'm sorry, you guys. You know what? I'm going to try it again. Okay? Ready? "Then the fox said"-- Hey, you two, let's let your mom get some sleep now. I'll finish reading to you in your room. - Yay. - Aw. Okay. Hugs. Kisses. Here, let me give you your meds. Oh, Roxie And the Fox. - Yeah. - That's their favorite. Here you go. The more you rest, the faster you'll recover. Okay. Here, I got this. Oh. Let's make this a little darker for you. Okay, let's go, Pickles. Come on. Sweet dreams. Hey. What are you doing out of bed? I just thought it might be good, you know, if I was up and around a little bit. Well, I don't know if that's the best idea. Oh. I think I just miss the kids. I know. But I-- I really think that you'd be better off in bed. God, I've just been in bed for so many days. I think I'm going stir crazy. Ahem. Oh. Hey, guys. Do you want to put your bathing suits on? - Yeah! - Yeah! Yes. [laughing] I'll just sit outside and watch them for a while. Okay. Well, I guess I'll put my suit on, too. Oh, perfect. You brought one. You know, I'm like a Boy Scout. I always come prepared. [children giggling] They always play so well together. Usually, until Toby gets tired of Zoey telling him what to do. So she calls the shots. She was born two minutes earlier than he was, so, you know, she's much older and wiser, according to her. How was your pregnancy? It was fantastic. Every single thing that I smelled made me wanna throw up. And I had enormous canckles. It was super hot. It was worth it. - You're lucky. - I know. We did try for a long time. They are miracles. IVF? Yeah. Oh, I just assumed when you said you'd tried for years. Plus the fact that you had twins. Yeah. We tried everything. I mean everything. I became like a human pincushion. Actually, it's-- it's true. Every time I see someone with twins these days, I always just wanna ask them who did their in vitro. Do you think you'll have more? No. [chuckles] We're so happy, just the four of us. It's really perfect. Hey, guys! I'm home! Toby? Zoey? Kay? Kay? [chattering] [chuckles] I think it's time for your needs. You ready to to back in? Mmm... I don't think so. Feels really good to be outside. Kaylene, in order for your meds to be most effective. We need to keep you on a regular schedule. Well, the good news is I'm not in that much pain right now. I don't want to get addicted. Are you saying you know better than your doctor? No. But I know how I feel. You know, there's this old rule in nursing, especially with injuries like yours. Stay ahead of the pain. The one thing we don't want is to wait until you're already in pain, before you take them, because by that time, it's too late. That makes sense. Okay. Good. - We're gonna get you better. - Thank you. ...and fentanyl. Dilaudid? You can't even get dilaudid. This is way too much medication for one person, right? This is too much medication for an entire platoon. Okay, jokester, not funny. No, you're right. I'm sorry. But I want to tell you something else. I mean, aside from her taking three different types of opioids, which... I don't even know how that happens, okay? Yeah. And benzos? I mean, Samantha, have you seen the models? She has three different prescribers and three different pharmacists. Which I'm assuming should not be happening. Well, it's illegal. There's that. But I would never prescribe her this. Okay, so what should she do? How sedated did she look? She can barely carry on a conversation. And she's sleeping half the day. Well, then she needs to see another doctor immediately. And she needs to take the meds with her. And, look, if you'd like, I will see her. - Really? - Yeah. That would be amazing. Listen. Here's my card. Make sure she uses it. And if she has any problem with appointments, make sure she calls my cell phone. So, seriously, are you just doing this 'cause you wanna do the right thing, or 'cause you just wanna get back in my, you know, life? Why, is this mutually exclusive? In my case, usually. Well, I could charge you for the session, if that would make you feel better. No, I'm good. - You sure? - Yeah. I'll buy you a coffee, though. - Maybe I'll pay. - [chuckles] Wow! There is some serious cooking going on in here. You know it. Mmm. You know what? This is... officially outstanding. Here. Try some. Wow. That really is good. Mm-hmm. But you know what it needs? Mmm, what? A couple glasses of wine. You know what, I could use one. Mm-hmm. Or ten. It has been a long week. - Voilà. - Wow. It smells good. You a nurse or a chef? Thanks. We make a good team. Team like you cook, I eat? Just the way I like it. Okay. You ready for dinner? Actually, I'm gonna take a plate to Kaylene before we sit down. Oh, you know what? I just checked on her. She's out cold. God, she's just sleeping so much. I know. It's like one minute she's fine, and then the next... Can I give you some advice? Tonight, give yourself a break. She'll be fine. But you need to relax and just not think about anything. That's an order. [chuckles] Tomorrow is another day, but tonight... well, just enjoy. You know, I saw you staring at me at the pool today. [chuckles] I don't know what you're talking about. You don't have to pretend. - Zoey, Toby! - I liked it. It's, uh, time for dinner. Hey, guys! Your daddy and I made a huge pot of spaghetti! - Yay! - Yeah, let's eat! He says you're taking way too many pills. Well, if that's true, then why were they prescribed? By three different doctors. He says you were overmedicated, and he will make time to see you. Do you feel a little bit loopy? Girl, I love you, but you are a lot loopy. I love you, too. And it's true, I haven't been paying attention to what she's been giving me, because she's a nurse, right? She's a really good nurse. Well, that is yet to be established. Why don't you go see Max? Oh, all right, I'll just check his schedule. Blah, blah, blah. Call him. You're so bossy, - All right, I'll call him. - Thank you. Okay, after that happens, you need to plan a weekend alone with your family. Tell Vanessa to take a hike for a few days. Yes, sir. - The whole weekend? - Yes, Drew's off work. So he's gonna be able to take care of me. I don't know if that's such a good idea. We'll be fine, I promise. Well, don't you have friends or family that you'd be excited to check in with? I'm sure. I guess I could get caught up on a few things. Perfect. Is everything okay? Are you unhappy with the job I'm doing? No, of course not. We just want to spend the time alone together as a family. I think I'm done. So that was really good. My leg feels way better. She said as she limped away, pretending not to be in pain. I'll be back in a couple of days, okay? - Okay. - Bye, Vanessa. I'm gonna miss you both so much. Now, try not to tire out your mom. She still needs a lot of rest, okay? - Pickles! - She's always resting. Pickles! Has anybody seen Pickles? I can't seem to find him. I can help you look. If you could check out back. - Sure. - Pickles! - Pickles! - Pickles! - Here, Pickles! - Pickles. We can't find him anywhere. He must have gotten out somehow. We have to find him. The kids are gonna be devastated. They already are. Toby and Zoey are in the kitchen crying. - They are? - Yeah. Vanessa's in there trying to console them. - She's still here? - She said she would stay and help. Yeah, of course she did. Kaylene, we need all the help we can get. I know. I'm starting to-- Why don't I send them in here with you, and then Vanessa and I will go out in the neighborhood and look again? Yeah, send them in with me. Pickles! Pickles! Has he ever gotten out before? No. He didn't have much common sense either, so I'm afraid he'll get hit by a car. You said Kaylene's been absent minded lately. Is it possible she accidentally left the gate open? I don't know. Maybe. This does happen with concussions. It can take a while for the brain to get to normal. [whistling] Pickles! - Pickles! - Pickles! [whistling] - Pickles! - Pickles! Daddy! Daddy! Did you find him yet? Hey, guys. Your daddy and I have been looking and looking, and we haven't found him yet. But we love you both so much. And we're not gonna stop. And I'm even gonna go out in a few minutes and look again. Okay? We are not gonna give up. We're all in this together. Okay? As a family? Come here. [laughing] Pickles. Pickles. [chuckles] What a stupid name. [muttering] [reading aloud, indistinct] - "How now," said the little brown cow. - There you two are. It's time for bed. They can sleep with me tonight. No, they can sleep in their own bed. Honestly, I don't mind. And they both just have been so sad. I think they'd rather stay with me. All right. Just this once. But don't make a habit out of it. - Good night. - Good night. I think there are worse habits. "Why don't you follow me to the grove?" ♪ We'll light it up like there's no tomorrow ♪ ♪ Hands up if you wanna be free ♪ ♪ We'll live it up like there's no tomorrow ♪ ♪♪ [continues] [gasping] [panting] [crashing] Where is she? Oh, I can take you if you want. I'll have to bring the kids with us. - Where's Vanessa? - She went to run an errand. It's all right. I'm sure Sam will be here. She's never late. Oh, there's Vanessa. Isn't she just the cutest? Hey, Zoey! Toby! Come meet your new dog. Who said anything about a new dog? I don't think that we're ready for a new dog. I'm so sorry I didn't check in with you first. Just the kids were so sad. And puppies make everything better, right? [puppy whimpering] That wasn't really your place, Vanessa. I know. Um, please don't be mad. My heart was in the right place. So is she gonna be our new puppy? - What are you gonna name her? - Jellybean! Hey, guys, maybe let's wait on naming her, okay, because we don't even know if we're gonna be keeping the dog. - Please, Mommy? - Please? - It's not really a great time-- - No. I mean, I guess... I could take her back to the pound if you don't want her, but she was next on the list to be euthanized. - What does that mean? - It's-- Um, you know what? Let's just keep the dog for right now. - [phone chiming] - Oh, there's Sam. Hey, where are you? Oh, yes. I'm so sorry. I thought you were someone else. Yes, I do have an appointment right now, but I think I'm gonna have to reschedule. - Look! She's peeing! - Ew! Oh, Vanessa will get that. Hey, babe. What's up? What's wrong? - What is it? - Have a seat. No. What's wrong? Is it the kids? Samantha was in a car accident. What? Is she okay? - I'm sorry. - Where is she? - I wanna go see her. - She didn't make it. What are you talking about? She ran into a tree or pole. They didn't tell me much. I'm gonna call her mother. Her mother's gonna know exactly what's going on. I spoke to the police. I identified the body. I'm sorry. There you go, little one. Kaylene: No, no, no! You know how we were talking about going out of town as a family right before Pickles went missing? Yeah. Can we do that? Yeah. Sure. It's a great idea. - Really? - Yeah. Let's go to the Marina. I'll get your medication schedule from Vanessa. No. I don't need them. - You sure? - Yeah. I don't feel like myself on all these pills. You haven't noticed? Samantha did. [doorbell rings] I'll get it. I'll get it. I'm gonna come with you. Look at you. You want to dance? Shut up. Mr. Larson? Kaylene. Sorry to bug you this late, but I need to talk to both of you. Sure. Thank you. We found something inside Samantha's car that's making us think this was not an accident. Okay. Traces of peanut residue were found all around the steering wheel. Makes us think somebody wanted her to have an allergic reaction while she was driving. What? The pill was in her purse. The purse was in the back seat. Probably didn't get to it in time, so she probably went into shock. Probably lost consciousness. And all that before the crash. How many people do you know knew about her allergy? It wasn't like she was keeping it a secret or anything. Everybody. You know, she was always so careful about what she ate. She always asked people ingredients and stuff like that. So I'm going to ask you some of the same questions I asked your husband after your accident, okay? Can you think of anyone who would have hurt Samantha? No. What-- - No? - Of course not. - Everybody loved her. - And, of course, you guys kind of had all the same friends. She was my best friend. Because I'm not willing to rule out the fact that whoever it is that killed Samantha is probably the same guy that was going after you on your bike. So I got to ask you a question, and I need you to really think about it. Are you sure there isn't something you're not telling me? I'm absolutely sure about everything that I'm telling you right now. Why would I not tell you something? Anything. Some thief-- - No. - ...some rivalry-- some petty little fight. No, there's not. Nothing? You're scaring me. I'm sorry. It's not my intention. I need you to be careful, okay? And, uh... keep my number handy. Okay? Thank you for your time. Thank you. Whoa. Way to come in hot, buddy. Ah, that's how he lives his life. - Daddy. - All right. Come on, Toby. So there was actually something I wanted to talk to you about. I do, too, but, uh, you go first. See, the last week has been pretty rough, especially for Kaylene. I know. So horrible. Uh, so we were going to go away for the weekend, just the four of us, so that we can explain to the kids and just be together as a family. I see. I knew you'd understand. I do. But, uh, there is something that I-- I've been meaning to tell you. Now works fine. This is hard because I know it's your wife we're talking about, and there's no question that she's improving physically, but... her mental state is really starting to worry me. Well, she did just lose her best friend. I meant before the accident. She seems confused, even paranoid at times. Maybe it's the pills she's on. This is not a medication reaction. Trust me. This is different. She breaks into tears over nothing. She spouts off delusions about people out to get her. I mean, I'm-- I'm worried that she's going to try to hurt herself. No. No way. You're not around her all day like I am. I think she's right. I think it's the medication that she's on. Thankfully, she's going to stop taking them soon. She can't do that. I mean, that would definitely be a mistake. Let's see what her doctor has to say about it. See, this is just another example of her poor decision making. And I think it's starting to affect you. In-- In the meantime, if you wouldn't mind going home for a few days. No. Of course not. Come on. Take us to the swings, Daddy. That's exactly what I was thinking. Drew: Ahh! [knock on door] - Vanessa: Kaylene? - Uh, yeah. The door's locked. Everything okay? Yeah. Everything's great. You sure? You seemed a little distant at breakfast. No, I'm great. Thank you. Okay. Well, we're all going for a swim. You want to join us and do some pool exercises? No, thanks. Uh, maybe later, okay? Okay. Just let me know. Okay. Who the hell are you? Oh. Damn it, Toby. [kids whooping] Raah! - Go! - The lobster's in the lead, but the dolphin's catching up! No! Hey, guys. - Hey. - You guys having fun? - Yeah, Mommy. - [laughter] Awesome! Toby, you remember we talked about you not leaving your cars all over the floor? They're everywhere. But I wasn't even playing with them today. He wasn't playing with his cars, Mommy. We were playing. You were? You look great, babe. You look like you're going to work. Oh, yeah. I have to go sign those disability papers, and then they're having some sort of get-well-soon surprise party for me, so I'm going to go act surprised. That's great. You're not driving, though, right? - No, I called a cab. - Okay. I have to be at the airport at 4. I'll be back before then. Guys, one more picture for Grandma. - Yay! Wave! - Oh. Wave, sweeties. Say "Hi, Grandma." Hi. Cheese, Vanessa. Yay! Drew: Bye. Super flying dolphin. - Raah! - [squealing] She looks familiar, but I don't know who she is. She was one of my nurses here. I think I've seen her around, but I never caught her name. She says her name's Vanessa Faraquon, but I don't think that's her real name. Well, I'm sorry. I can assure you there's no one here by that name. How's that possible? She said she's a registry nurse and that she was filling in for one of the nurses on maternity leave. We haven't had anybody out on maternity leave since I had my daughter 14 years ago. Ooh. Wait. That one hurt. [laughs] [chuckles] You know, earlier today I went to the hospital, and just wanted to say hi to the girls. No one had ever heard of you. I told you you. I was just filling in. [chuckles] Nobody even bothered to learn my name. They said that there were no nurses on maternity leave. I was told someone was on leave. I mean, I just assumed it was maternity leave, but who knows. I-- I just go wherever they tell me. Life of a traveling nurse. [chuckles] - How's your leg feeling? - It's okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know, it's important to keep pushing yourself. How about we wade a little bit deeper? Nah, that's okay. I'm good here. Come on. [chuckles] Your broken leg is half the size of your good one. You know, you gotta build back up your muscle tone. Yeah, um... [whispering] can I tell you a secret? I, uh-- I'm not really that great of a swimmer. So-- I got you. You'll be fine. - I'm not-- - Yeah. Here. Hang onto this. There you go. This is not gonna work 'cause my cast is gonna get wet with this. Well, just-- just rest it on the kickboard. No, it's still gonna get wet. - I promise you, you'll be fine. - No, see, this isn't gonna be-- This isn't strong enough to hold me. No, it's good for someone twice your size. - No, I'm already sinking. - So, okay, I want you to go forward. - Actually, I think I want to go back now. - Go forward, and move your leg. - No, I just want to-- - Yeah, now move your leg. Oh, I can't touch right here. I want to go back over there now. Now, I want you to start treading water. No, I'm gonna go back over there. No, I'm not okay. I'm not kidding, I want to go back over to the edge. I want to go to the edge. No! No! Hold onto me! Help me, please! Oh! I can't kick up. I can't keep above the water. It's sink or swim time. - Mommy. - Mommy. Both: Vanessa. Please help me! Both: Mommy. Vanessa. [gasping] Mommy. Kaylene: [gasping] Hey, guys. We were just doing some exercises to make her legs stronger. Kids, go inside. There's no swimming right now. Both: Oh, please? Go back inside. I'll meet you inside. - Get out of my house. - Kaylene. What's going on, Mommy? Um, nothing, everything's fine. I think you guys just go over to Mrs. Gilbert's for a couple hours, okay? But why? Um, just because I have to deal with a couple things, - one of the-- - [knocking] One of the neighbors is having a... problem, so-- - I'm just gonna help fix it. - Oh, Kaylene. Is everything okay? Yeah, can you watch the kids for a couple of hours? Of course. Uh, anything else I can do? Yeah, please just keep them inside today, okay? All right. Oh, by the way, you never returned my call from the other day. What call? I left you a voicemail, said it was important we talk. No, I didn't get it. What was it about? How about I email you instead? - Okay, great. - [siren chirps] Look, Mommy, it's the police. Oh, dear, what's that about? Um, it's okay. I called them because - you know how that neighbor is having that problem? - Oh, right, yes. Kids, let's have some ice cream, okay? [panting] There's no problem here, officer. I'm-- I'm sorry to have wasted your time. And do you work here? I'm Kaylene's home care nurse. She was in a car accident a few weeks ago, and suffered a number of serious injuries, including head trauma. And there is still some paranoia and delusional thinking. No, I'm not paranoid, officer. She just tried to drown me in my pool. We were doing some simple physical therapy. Kaylene had some difficulty with it, and... now she thinks I was trying to kill her. She is trying to kill me. Can I see both your IDs please? - Is that really necessary? - Oh, that's very interesting. You don't want to show him your ID? Why? You don't want us to know what your real name is? Officer. When she comes back, she's gonna show you her ID, and it's not gonna be the name that she claims to be. I looked her up on the computer, I Googled her there's nothing. She's not even on social media, she doesn't exist. Is your husband home by any chance? He's not home right now. He's a commercial airline pilot. He's on a flight right now. - When will he be back? - Yesterday. I mean, uh, today, I think. Okay. Your ID, please. - Here, officer. - Oh, I'll go get-- I brought both of our IDs. Where'd you get my ID? You went into my purse and got my ID? This is not your home. This is my home! Kaylene, your license was on the table. Remember? It wasn't in your purse. Let's see what her real name is. - What's her name? - Vanessa Ren-- Renzy? Wh-- Renzy? That's not what you said your name was. You said your name was Vanessa Faraquan. Renzy is my maiden name. I-- I just never got around to changing it - at the DMV. - Is there anyone else - who can come over and be with you right now? - No, there's no one-- - A friend? - I don't need anyone else to come here. I just want you to remove this woman from my home permanently. I think, under the circumstances, that might be the best thing to do right now. Officer, it would be medically unethical for me to leave her alone in this state right now. [cell phone rings] Oh, it's my husband calling. - Kaylene. - Drew, where are you right now? - I know you want her gone. - Yes, I do want her out. - She tried to kill me. - Chill. There is a police officer here right now, and he's gonna escort her out. - There's a police officer there? - Wait. Wait, wait. - Wait, wait. - What is going on? How do you already know about this? She called me. I already spoke to Vanessa. You called my husband? I called him just now because we were both worried about you. - Drew, I need you to stop talking to this wo-- - Chill. - I'm totally calm! - Let me speak to the officer. Yes, hold on. My husband wants to talk to you for a second. - Yes, Mr. Larsen. - I'm on my way home. - I understand. - Until then, she should not be left alone. Thank you for clearing that up. Your husband says he's coming home early to be with you. Until then, he'd rather you not be alone. ♪♪ Who else have you been keeping from me? Woman's Voice: Hello. You've reached the Oakdale Fertility Clinic. Please leave a message and someone from our team will get back to you as soon as possible. - [beep] - Hi, this is Kaylene Larsen. Um, I see that I have a missed call from you. Can you have someone call me back as soon as possible at this number? Thank you. [panting] Where are you going? You win. Enjoy the house. [door slams] [knocking] Yes, can I help you? I, uh-- Sorry to bother you. Do you happen to know Vanessa Renzy? Oh, no. [sighs] What has she done now? Can I come in for a minute? Of course. Woman: Well, things were never the same again after the diagnosis a couple of years ago. She, um, got very depressed. Couldn't get herself out of bed. And, um... she lost her job, then her home. Do you mind if I ask what she was diagnosed with? Uh-- Oh, what do they call it? Uh, premature ovarian insufficiency. It basically means that she can't have children. Right. So, after she got this diagnosis, that's when she found out that her husband had died in the war? What? Did she tell you that? I don't know what to tell you, but Vanessa's never been married. She's come close. Always wanted to be. Wanted kids, too. I don't know what happened to her. I'm sorry. You know, she came back home and moped around for about a year. And then, like, a switch went off. She was fine. She went back to school, got a part-time job, started looking for an apartment. We really thought that she'd moved on. So... what has she done now? She's obsessed with my family. And it's starting to scare me a little bit. So, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with her. I don't know if you've ever... seen her obsessed with anyone in the past, or-- No, she's been a loner these past two years. Can I ask how you two met? Yeah. She pretended to be my nurse at St. Vincent's. Pardon? I'm gonna guess she's not a nurse, either. She has a medical background. She went to pharmacy school. I was so proud of her. But she is not a nurse. I-- I really want to help. But the truth is, I... haven't seen or heard from her since she borrowed my car over a month ago. I really miss her. Will you ask her to call me? Yes, of course. Thank you. [cell phone rings] Hello. Hi, this is Kaylene. Um, thank you so much for returning my call. Woman: Hi, Kaylene. We already spoke last week. Don't you remember? Uh, no, I don't. Yes, we did. I placed the call myself. You answered, and I connected you to Dr. Bartelini. Right. What did we discuss? That's really more for the doctor to say. Can you please tell the doctor that I'm going to be there in exactly ten minutes, and I really need to speak to her in person. Okay. We'll see you then. Thank you. [car starts] So, it wasn't you I was speaking with last week? No. Who was it? I think it was my home care nurse. What exactly were you calling me about? We had a privacy breach with one of our employees. Or should I say, former employees. She got a job here under false pretenses, using a fake ID and falsified qualifications. We didn't discover that until she disappeared one day with another male employee. Okay. The police found his body a couple of weeks ago. Now, we don't know if she had anything to do with it, but there was talk that the two were having sexual relations. Okay, well, this sounds awful, - but I just don't know what it has to do with me. - Kaylene. He was our egg donation database coordinator. We have reason to believe that he was accessing and sharing private patient records. Not my records. Yes. Now, I want you to know that we are doing everything that we can-- I'm sorry, I have to interrupt you. Is that her? That's her. Her hair is different, but that is definitely her. - Is she your nurse? - Yes. Okay, Kaylene, I know the DA's still working on the case, but I think that you should call the police right away, because as far as I know, they are still looking for her. What do you think she wants from me? [sighs] I know you came in this from the other end, but a lot of girls in college, they donate their eggs for tuition money. It pays well and they never have to think about it again. So she's an egg donor? She's your egg donor. You were the only one to carry pregnancy to term with embryos derived from her eggs. In her warped mind, I think she believes your children are her children. I'm so sorry. Babe. I'm home. Hi, honey. How was your trip? Vanessa. What the-- Shh. Honey. I want you to listen to me. Okay? The last thing I want to do is shoot you. I love you. You know that? You're the father of our children. That's right. My eggs, your sperm. Oh, it's a shame they couldn't get together in a more fun way. But what I need for you to do for us right now is drink that smoothie. It's not gonna hurt you. It's just gonna take the edge off. Vanessa-- [gunshot] Drink your smoothie, honey. It's gonna be a fun night. Hello. This is Eileen Gilberts. Leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you. Have a nice day.

I tried to stop her, I swear I did, but she hit me with one of my gold clubs. Tell me where you think she took the kids. I don't know. I'm so sorry. Just go find them. Go! [breathing heavily] Hello?

Um, it's important. It's an emergency. [panting] Detective. I think the home care nurse has kidnapped my children. No, my husband's car isn't here, either. See you soon. [panting] Come on. Come on. This woman was an egg donor at the fertility clinic where I had done my IVF. It's supposed to be completely anonymous, but as a matter of a couple of years later, this person finds out that she can't have kids anymore, - and that's when she started freaking out. - Oh, wait, wait. So she investigated, found out who had her eggs, and then you're saying she seduced and took out the clinic employee? Yeah, then she thought she could kill me and move in on my family. She had to follow you around for at least two weeks to figure out your routine and your bike route. I mean, my friend Samantha, she saw it right away. She said there's something off with this girl. I was so out of it I didn't realize it. No, it was my fault, I was so overmedicated, I should have been there for her. She was gonna take me to a doctor the day she died. - Samantha was? - Yeah. So Vanessa probably killed her to keep her quiet. I'm gonna call in for back up, okay? When we get to the cabin, I need you to stay in the car. I'm not staying in the car. Stay in the car. She already tried to kill you once, please don't give her a chance to do it again. This woman has kidnapped my husband and my kids. I'm not just gonna sit in the car. Give me a chance to go in there first, and try to reason with her. Come up with some sort of peaceful solution. - Solution? - You gotta trust me, and stay your ass in the car. ♪♪ [door creaks] I spent all of my summers here growing up.

You're scaring them. Why are they scared? I mean, we're finally all together. If... you put the gun away, it would help. You know, I wish I could. But I don't trust you. Now, I know that, eventually, you'll learn to love me, but... until that happens, I need this gun to insure that my family will never leave me. I want to go home. [chuckles] We are home. This is our home now. No one will ever bother us here. God. You know, all I ever wanted was for us to be together. Is that so much to ask? Hey. It was-- It was a long ride up here. We're tired and hungry. Maybe if they take a nap, they'll feel better. Okay. That's a good idea. Daddy is gonna go show you to your room. Right in there. While Mommy tidies up a bit. Yeah. Come on.

Not some rich bitch. Who was able to plunk down thousands of dollars to buy the children of her choice. [sighs] But that's all ancient history.
