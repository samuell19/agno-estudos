Good afternoon Mss. Gault Good afternoon Judson. I'd like to... Hello Kate What do you want? Will you tell Guy I want to see him? I'm afraid he doesn't wish to see you I shall have to hear that from Guy. Don't you think I deserve an explanation? Very well... Will you please wait here I'm sorry... Guy doesn't wish to see you I told you that I'd have to hear that from... Guy himself Emily Emily, you shouldn't have come here So I understand. But guy, don't you. Think I deserve... something a little more than a note? Look at me and tell me you don't love me My darling, I do love you very much. That's why I sent you... that letter. Because I really love you Now darling, please go away and forget you ever met me I know what happened Guy My father told me Did he tell you why? Despite what he thinks... I didn't run away from what was inside that coffin... but from what I knew to be inside me I... I don't understand I hoped to spare you this. But if you do understand then you'll realize... why there can never be a marriage between us. Come with me Where does this lead? Below You all right? Yes... I... think so Do you want to go back? No You've often expressed a wish to meet the rest of my family Here they are. All my ancestors famous and infamous, laid... here to... what's the term? To rest From the beginning, death has come to the Carrell's like an assassin... but the least fortunate of all was my father How did he die? Like a single candle in a dark airless room... Emily, my father... Guy! It's time for your medicine Oh, yes, I'd forgotten... I'm sorry What medicine? Laudanum. Guy, is this the cause of your... No, not a cause... an effect. Without it, I couldn't sleep Guy, tell me I should never have gone with your father and those doctors that night I'm interested in private research. I can never forget that poor... wretch whose grave they robbed. His staring eyes, his clutching hands... his fingernails broken and bloody from a vain attempt to claw away... the lid of that coffin. All this has a special meaning... for me, Emily... for years I've lived in dread of being... buried alive Can you possibly conceive it... the unendurable oppression of the lungs... the stifling fumes of the damp earth. The rigid embrace of the coffin... The blackness of the absolute night. The silence... like an overwhelming sea... and then, invisible in the darkness... but all too hideously real to the other senses. The presence of the Conqueror Worm... Guy! I'm sorry These things are morbid fantasies I'm afraid not, every member of my family has met with a violent death I... now... await my turn How did your father die? Catalepsy... do you know what that is? When it strikes... the victim has every outward sign of being dead But he's not dead. He's alive I was barely thirteen when my father was stricken The doctor said it was a heart attack. There was a funeral and... then he was sealed in this vault. That night I heard him crying out... a pitiful, desperate cry. I begged them, I pleaded them... He's alive... he's alive! I said but no one would believe me. Because it wasn't true! It was! I heard him In your mind No Kate. It would be easier for me to accept that... but I know the truth. God help me. I know the truth! My father's inheritance, and my wedding gift to you... Catalepsy Now you know why I asked your forgiveness There's nothing to forgive. But you must understand... I understand that I love you and I ant to be your wife My brother is ill Then I shall nurse him. Guy, if you love me, if you really love me... you won't shut me out of your life. You'll let me share it with you You want that? After what you've heard? More than ever before Tell her Guy, tell her Kate, you've been most considerate and you've always thought of me well That's true But in some things I must make my own decisions Of course. Then, I take it that you have made your decision? I have Then let it be on your own head Do you Guy, take Emily to be your lawful wedded wife for better or worse... in sickness and in health so long as you both shall live? I do! Do you Emily, take Guy to be your lawful wedded husband for better or... worse in sickness and in health so long as you both shall live? I do! If there be any here who know just cause why these two shouldn't be joined together in holy matrimony let him speak now or forever hold his peace The ring please Repeat after me. With this ring I with the wed... With this ring I... Then I do pronounce you man and wife A toast... to the most beautiful bride and the most fortunate groom ever... lived. May they be happy to the end of their days! No, Guy, not in front of everyone Then you'd better go and play something before I lose control completely Isn't she beautiful? Very Are you enjoying yourself father? Don't stop playing, Emily... it's lovely Emily, I want to wish you every happiness Thank you Miles You're going to Venice for your honeymoon What's that? I... I'm sorry I inquired if you were going to Venice for your honeymoon Carrell! Forgive me! Please What the devil is the matter with the fellow? Emily. That melody you're playing what is it? Molly Malone... do you like it? No... please stop playing it But it's a charming melody I said please stop playing it! I'm sorry... I Is there anything I can do Guy? I'll come with you Guy No please leave me alone! All of you, leave me alone! Guy darling. Please wake up! They've all gone now Yes Emily Are you feeling better? I think so What's the matter Guy? What happened to you down there? I can't remember exactly. I was talking with your father and then... And then what? The music... something about the music you were playing... What was it about the music? It was the tune that he was whistling that night Who was? There were two of them, Sweeny and Mole, their names were filthy... disgusting creatures. They were the ones who opened the grave And all the time... whistling that loathsome tune! Darling, now we're alone... Alone! Just the two of us... together What's that? I don't know It sounded like a scream! Stay here King. King, old fellow He's dead It must have been the lightning I'll bury him As you wish. Now, let us go in out of the rain, darling Why, he was only stunned... I was going to bury him! Guy... I was going to bury him! Alive! Sketching... out there? I'm not sketching really... making plans For the house? You're very inquisitive Well, I'm married now and wives are supposed to be inquisitive And husbands are supposed to be secretive. I'll tell you one of my secrets A very closely guarded one. I can kiss a woman without touching her Oh Guy... really You don't believe me? I'll wager you a shilling I'll accept your wager. Well, come on, show me this miracle With pleasure There you are What about your wager... Oh, I lose the wager. Here's your shilling It was worth much more. Believe me Guy... Yes, dear What about our honeymoon? You promised to take me to Venice. Remember? Aren't you happy here? Yes, of course but you're on your own so much and... I worry about you You must be patient with me All right, in the meantime I'll brighten up that dreary old house Hmm, aren't they lovely? Take them away! Guy... don't be so ill-tempered. I can't live in a house without flowers Throw them away. I loathe flowers. You must promise never to bring... those sickly funeral decorations into the house You must promise! All right, I promise Miss Yes Judson? Dr. Archer has arrived Show him in, please This way, sir... Thank you Judson. Emily! Miles, how kind of you to come Is something wrong? Guy is ill Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I suppose it's the Italian climate We didn't go to Italy We've been here... in this house ever since the day we were married I don't understand Neither do I. All I know is that Guy is ill You've got to help him Miles But my dear, surely your father has done everything that can be done My father has done nothing. To him, Guy is a perfectly healthy man But that isn't true. You must do something to help him, Miles If you don't, something terrible will happen. He's a changed man I don't even recognized him Well, I'll do whatever I can. Why don't you take me to see him? Thank you. I'll just get my wrap Your wrap? It's chilly on the moors... Emily... where is he? There. He started building it a month ago Guy! Guy! Yes? Let me in Go away, I'm busy Guy, please open the door Emily didn't you understand me. I said... I... Hello Guy Hello Miles, I'm glad to see you I must apologize, I was very rude Yes Guy, you were... very rude You see, I've been quite ill... So I understand Guy, I brought Miles along to see if he can help you That was very solicitous but quite unnecessary How? Come inside, I'll show you This is it. My grand plan What will it be? Some liqueur... brandy... Guy... Now let us think of something appropriate. To death... Not drinking? What a pity it's really quite good Guy Yes my dear? You wish to say something? In that case let me tell you about my latest addition, I thought of it... It's highly unlikely that I shall ever use it, but one never knows... It makes an easy egress and it's completely impassable from the outside A simple arrangement, I'll grant... but effective Guy, this is madness Madness? It's the only sane answer to my problem I'll show you just how mad I am I suppose she's told you my father was a cataleptic... No, but that doesn't mean that... that I'm prone to the same affliction. Let us consider the following Apropos nothing at all, I have an attack during dinner Emily sends Judson for a doctor he examines me and pronounces me dead. I'm of course alive. You know the nature of catalepsy But to the rest of the world... I'm gone. Passed on... deceased... So a funeral is held and I'm brought down here to this vault and... placed in this coffin My mourners have departed, the doors are both locked and I'm alone Now play close attention... Now the slightest movement of my finger caused that to open I am now free. But I'm still capable of only slight... effort, so... What if no one hears the bell? The departing mourners have locked... the door But is that really foolproof? What if the gate should stick? But of course, it's barely possible that all these methods... might fail. So... But tools break too, don't they? A recent invention by a Swedish chemist named Nobel It's called dynamite, an explosive How can one be sure the stuff will work? One can't, of course... so one has... a bit of food and something to drink... every five or ten minutes or so and rings the bell Reads a periodical or perhaps a book. In the event the strain... becomes too great one can avail ones self of the effects of music And then one simply waits. Rather well thought out, don't you think? But no plan is ever perfect. So, the place de resistance or perhaps I should say, the coup de grace What is it, Guy? What is it? The cure for all suffering, the answer to all problems The key my darling to heaven or to hell, or to nothingness Poison! Thank you Judson Tea is ready in the dining room Thank you Judson How do you explain it, Miles? Well, I don't as yet. However, I venture to guess that the episode at... the cemetery changed a general fear into a specific obsession Then you don't think he is a cataleptic? Well, he's never had these attacks before, fainting spells, dizzy spells No, but his father... To the best of our knowledge, catalepsy is not an inherited affliction And there's a new line of thought among some of us, myself, Cargrave... and others that may shed some light on Guy's case. Most people tend to think than the body and the mind as being totally different. We point the fact that they are actually linked. No sugar Do you follow me? Yes, I think so You see, physically, Guy may be perfectly... This constant fear that gnaws at him night and day may actually... bring a condition of catalepsy where no such condition exists now I see. Well, what can be done? I'm not sure... I'm not sure at all I do know this, that Guy's mind is like a keg of gunpowder... anything might set the fuse, any reminder of death or graves. That's the first thing you must remember Yes, yes. I understand I wish you could come and stay with us I was just thinking, the laboratory downstairs. Is it still there? Sure Guy offered me the use of it to further my researches If I accept I might be able to come here from time to time Miles, that would be wonderful Thank you, thank you very much Well, I must go now, but I'll be back And remember, the smallest thing... don't forget I won't forget Dear Emily Frog, please, Judson Yes sir Your frog, sir Put it down here. We take one terminal of the battery in contact with... the nerve and the other in contact with the muscle We cause contraction of the muscle There... you see? If you could control the responses of the human mind as easily as... you control the frog's, I might have some faith in your work Someday we may be able to of we continue our investigation and if you were to... No, no, no I think you should make an effort to take your mind off your fears Take Emily to Venice, when you return most of your problem will have gone I'll think about it Don't think about it, do it Meanwhile, I'll leave you to your little friends Do you wish to continue, sir Yes, yes, Judson You and Miles were right, I do have to get outside occasionally I told you, all we need is each other... we need nothing else to be happy How true. How true that really is What is it? Listen What's the matter, darling? That whistling... I... I don't hear anything Listen, I tell you...! Guy! Guy don't run away! Guy...! Guy! Guy! Guy! Darling, what's wrong? I saw them You saw whom? Those two filthy grave robbers were coming for me. Emily saw them No, I saw no one... But you must have, they passed right by us. Surely you heard them Guy, you're overwrought... Please, they were coming for me No one questions your word, Guy... I saw them as clearly as I'm seeing you! Darling, please let's go back home and you can rest then you can talk You didn't see them? No. It was dark and foggy and... I'll join you downstairs in a while I just want to rest for a while All right darling. We'll be waiting for you I don't know. The lady Thank you Judson How is he, Emily? Better, I think. He's resting. What do you suppose he saw? Exactly what he said, the two grave robbers Well, then why didn't I see them? Because they weren't real You mean, there was something supernatural? I don't deny that possibility however I do believe that there is a logical... explanation. Emily, the human mind is a remarkable instrument It can create something out of nothing and that's probably what happened What you're trying to say is that Guy is mad? No, nothing of that sort. He's disturbed and there's a difference If his father was prematurely interred... He wasn't How do you know? I know because I went to the crypt and saw for myself My father rests in peace It's the wind Guy! Here's there There's nobody there But you must have been him! I saw only you, Guy Miles, what are we going to do? Ever since that night on the moors... he's been... well, I just don't recognize him Have you asked him to go away with you How ca I? He won't come out of there and he won't let me in All he want's to do is just sit and brood Miles you've got to do something Emily, I'm afraid I'm done all I can Some day treatment of the mind will be a science and they'll be able to cope with such problems but at this present stage... Emily, there's one thing we haven't tried Why... just tell me what to do Guy! Guy, let me in! Well, this is quite a surprise. Is there any purpose to this visit... apart that is from interrupting my work? Yes. I thought you'd given up painting Merely portraiture. Let us say I'm entering a new period May I see it? I don't think you'll find it very pleasing Surely, I should be the one to decide that Very well, don't say I didn't warn you I call it, "Some Consummations Devoutly To Be Wished" But why? Think! All these dreadful tortures you see depicted here... the rack, the stake, the whole ghastly catalogue, are they not indeed... devoutly to be wished, preferred to that fate, the most terrible of all? That fate has already come to pass, Guy You don't fear a burial alive because you are... already buried alive. What is it you're afraid of? Being locked... in a tomb? Well, you've been locked in a tomb for months This tomb and I've been your widow and I don't like being your widow And what's more, I'm not going to be much longer Emily No Guy, I'm here to give you a choice. You can have this living death... or you can have me. But you can't have both Emily, please I love you Guy, and I want to take care of you but as long as... you're here... I can't. No one can I... realize that... but... I'm so afraid Oh, but you don't need to be, my darling. I promise you Look at me. I promise you that no matter what happens... I'll never let them take you down to that horrible crypt Trust me to take care of you I do, trust you, Emily. It isn't that, it's... Guy, if you choose me then you must destroy this evil vault Wipe it off the face of the earth and out of your mind, forever. If you don't... then I shall never see you again. Well, which is it to be. Death by yourself... or life with me. Emily! Emily! Please forgive me, darling. I wouldn't loose you. Not for anything Guy... I love you Guy, that took great courage No, I was motivated by fear of loosing something more valuable than my life You'll never regret it I pray God, you're right I want to thank you both for asking me to the ceremony. I suppose that now, you'll be having that honeymoon Yes, but first there'll be a small party, Friday night You will be with us, Miles, won't you? If your father doesn't keep me working at the hospital He won't... because we shall invite both of you Well, of course, in that case... Lady Catherine? My Lord? Thank you Judson My friends, to life! Right! Doctor Gault, would you like a cigar? Join us Miles? Just a moment It's extraordinary, he looks the picture of health, don't you agree? Looks can be deceiving doctor Archer Oh thank you, thank you Permit me to offer my congratulations on your recovery I think you should offer them to Emily and Miles, they're responsible Well, father... are you enjoying yourself? I never enjoy myself. I experience greater and lesser degrees of tedium It's just the cat, darling Yes, I know... but why should she cry like that? Hungry, I expect Where is she? It sounds as if it was coming from over there The poor little thing must be stuck Wait a minute Look at that. It's down in here Poor kit, we'll have you out in a moment Oh, how could she get behind there? She must have crawled through The poor little thing There, you see, no harm done after all There, she's all right Guy, are you all right? What if we hadn't heard her? But we did hear her You haven't put these thoughts out of your mind after all, have you? Of course he has. This is just a short of... You haven't, have you? You've got to put it out of your mind I've tried... I've tried everything Not everything, your fear of catalepsy is based on your belief that... your father was prematurely buried, isn't that correct? I heard him! I heard his voice You think you heard him I heard his voice! All right, then prove it! What do you mean? Take me down to the crypt and show me his body I can't Because you know it isn't true. Yes! Why else do you think you've avoided it? Because you're afraid to admit fear's nothing more than a trick of your mind I'd give anything to find out if that were true All right then, take me downstairs! All right, I will Oh, Guy, don't you think you should wait? Miles is right. I've put this off long enough The key to the crypt it's gone! Who has access to these? No one but myself You keep it looked? Did you come down here and take the key? I don't think so. Is it possible for someone to do a thing like... that and not remember? It's possible. You admit to doing things lately that you don't remember Well, it's unimportant. We'll break it open Follow me Which one is it? Over there... I can't You must. It's your only chance. If you fail now, you'll be haunted... forever Kate, bring me a mirror! You're wasting your time. He's dead Oh, he can't be! Oh! He's finished. Heart attack Are you sure, Doctor Gault? To be absolutely sure, we should make one more test Foolishness. The man is dead! Judson, help me with the galvanic battery I'm alive, I'm alive. Can't you hear me? I'm alive! Right here, Kate, you and Emily had best leave the room Miles! Miles! In the name of Heaven! Well, is he dead or isn't he? He is No! I'm not dead! I'm alive! Judson help me with the battery We may as well take him back to the crypt No. I promised him no matter what happened, I'd never let them take... him down to the crypt Nonsense Emily. Well, it's your decision Every man that is born of woman has a short time to live and... is full of misery and is cut down like a flower... he fleath as it were a shadow and never continue in one stay. In the midst of life we are in death... Of whom may we seek for succor but of Thee, dear Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased... Yet, O Lord God most mighty, O holy and most merciful Saviour... deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death... Thou knows, Lord, the secrets of our hearts... Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayers, but spare us. God most mighty. O most merciful Saviour, thou most worthy Judge eternal... suffer us not, at our last hour for any pains of death Suffer us not, suffer us not... The pains of death... Oh please, help me Someone help me! Help me! Amen Amen You may say farewell now Goodbye, my darling Emily! Emily! Come back! Come back! They'll see me... They'll look at my eyes. They're not taking me to... the crypt. But where are they taking me? Where? Why can't I move... Oh, God, why can't I move? Oh merciful God, we consign the soul of Guy Carrell... son of Gideon and Agatha Carrell to Thine eternal care. Amen Amen Look at me! someone look at me! Oh, for God's sake! You can't bury me... alive. Can't you see? I'm alive! Oh, why can't I move? No! No! Help me! Someone help me! I'm alive! Can't you hear me? Can't you see my eyes! I'm alive! Alive! Alive! You'll be leaving, I suppose... after the reading of the will Why should you say that? No reason. I merely thought that under the circumstances you... might find this house rather disturbing to your conscience. Are you implying that Emily is in any way responsible for Guy's death? No one is responsible. He died of a heart attack induced by shock. Yes, I understand He brought on the shock himself. The episode in the crypt and the others... They were planned, contrived... Don't you see? Planned? By whom? By Guy himself. In a strange way... he wanted to die Stop talking about it! Stop talking about it! It's a bit much, Mr. Sweeny. -What is Mr. Mole? - The old gentleman sending us out there to dig up his own son in law! - Well, one stiff is pretty much like another. We've struck wood. Now, where's the bloody crowbar? -I believe I left it up on top - Would you do me the kindness to fetch it down? -I will, Mr. Sweeny I found it, Mr. Sweeny No! No! I never did nothing to you! Please! Please! I never did nothing to you! Sweeny! You blithering idiot? I told you to take him to my... quarters in town. Well, I may as well have a look at him now. Ironic, don't you think? And... or... rather fitting In life, Guy Carrell contributed nothing to the medical profession In death he shall serve it admirably Sweeny! No! You're dead! No! Emily, there's nothing wrong with you Well, not physically, perhaps Then why did you send Judson for me? I was... I was afraid to be alone I can understand that. Perhaps you shouldn't be there Miles, don't you see...? Please, come and sit down Now, just for a moment and then you must go to sleep Miles, you must know or at least you must sense that... I've been very worried. I'm in need of something or... someone to give me solace... You and I were very close once, Miles You remember that, don't you? I can remember a medical student who was poor as a church mouse... and a girl who wanted to be a great lady I was very foolish. Miles, maybe it's not too late for us But, Emily... I made a mistake Was that so very wrong? Come in Doctor Archer, excuse me. My lady It's something I'd like to see, if you would A medical matter? Then certainly Dr. Gault could take care of it I think Dr. Gault would want you to come as quickly as possible, sir! Perhaps you had better go, Miles Well, come along, Judson Judson, why are you behaving so oddly? I heard a sound from the laboratory sir... just a bit ago, and... Yes? See for yourself, sir Who's that? Miles? No welcome? No rejoicing? No kiss? Why? Killed by electrical force Dr. Archer That's Sweeny Emily! Emily! Emily! Guy... Guy! No... now... now, you've got to listen to me... Listen to what? More lies? More deceit? More treachery? Oh, no, that's not true Oh, but it is. You were very clever Emily Very clever. In a way I'm sorry to spoil your plans I had no plans... it was Kate. You wouldn't kill me, would you, Guy? No, darling. Not at all. Just as you didn't kill me! You wouldn't soil your pretty hands with murder... No, you just stood aside and let them bury me alive! No Guy! no! And so, I shall not kill you That sorry task I shall leave to the earth and the darkness... and the terrified pounding of your own heart! Oh, no, no, not that! Yes, my beautiful, my perfidious, my treacherous love... that! No! Don't! Guy! Guy! Stay precisely where you are, Miles I've no desire to harm you What have you done, Guy? Paid a debt... of long standing... No! This has nothing to do with you. I found that earlier this evening In Heaven's name, Guy! Yes... In Heaven's name! Give me that shovel! She's dead! Thank God! Kate! What are you saying? Are you so blind? Can't you see? That's the key to the crypt! She had no time to replace it I can't believe it! Not Emily! Yes, Emily... Sweet, beautiful, gentle Emily... Once you told her how easy it would be to use Guy's fear to kill him she went to work... first... the hiring of the grave robbers to torment him... the cat in the wall, and finally the desecration of... our father's tomb! Oh, Guy!, I knew what she was doing and I wanted to tell you but wouldn't have believed me. I had to wait for proof. You can see that, can't you? But I waited too long... I was too late! Too... late! ---oOo---
