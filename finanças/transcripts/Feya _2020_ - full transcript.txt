Animal Rights are human rights! Animal Rights are human rights! Animal Rights are human rights! Animal Rights are human rights! Animal Rights are human rights! Animal Rights are human rights! Animal Rights are human rights! Animal Rights are human rights! Move along! Nothing to see here! Grab her, grab her! Let go! Let go of me! Hey, hey, hey, where are you going? - Let me just sit here for a little bit... - A little bit? Get out of here. I’m begging you, please. Hey, you’re going to get it all over my car. - I’ll clean it all later, please. - Why did you have to open the door? Fine, let’s go. Thank you... You know, no one has ever risked their life for me. Who risked theirs for you? You... I’m Tanya... And what’s your name? Masha, her name is Masha. She opened the door. Can Masha not say it herself? No, Masha can’t say it herself. Right, Masha? Can you quit fidgeting? Where should I let you out? At the metro? No, I can’t go in the metro looking like this, I need to clean this off. But that isn’t our problem, but yours. So tell me where I should let you out. - Where are you going? - We are taking care of some things. Could I go with you to clean myself. Stop, how about you get out of here, come on, come on. Please, you’re ready to throw me into the street like this? I used to work in an office as well, yeah, but it wasn’t my thing at all. I used to do a lot of things, I studied at the art institute, then I left. It’s just that you have to do something important in life, in my opinion. I actually want to become an actress, but it seems to me that there are more opportunities in Europe, France... I actually went to Paris, and studied French, but I can’t say that I know it perfectly, I just can’t speak fluently, so I thought of becoming a model, but they are all quiet... so, I found a modelling agency, the best in Paris, of course, because what’s the point of going to a bad one. And I found out that Kate Moss was in that same agency, and I look like her so I thought I had a bigger chance of getting in. So I meet with them and say - bonjour. Je m’appelle Tatiana. Je veux travailler avec vous, like I want to work with you, and they answered in French, but I didn’t really understand what they said, because they were speaking French. But it just didn’t work out with them. But when life isn’t going well I just think to myself, screw it all, I’ll just go to Lars von Trier, he’s my favorite director. I even wrote him a letter, and he replied saying that they don’t have anything going on right now, but they’ll keep me in mind. I think it’s just that genius people are very simple people. But I haven’t seen him yet, I just haven’t had any time, but I definitely will. I even took his stage name, Tatiana Trier. Are you always this positive? Smiling? Well, yeah, why should I be sad? My mouth doesn’t close all the way when I relax my face. That’s all. The bathroom is over there. Everyone is waiting for you - at the meeting. - Great... Masha, let’s go... Masha, let’s go... Alina, this is Trier, a prominent social activist. She’s fighting, well, for something, basically, she needs to shower and probably get dressed into something, ask the film crew, they should have some clothes, alright? Alright! Do you want some tea? Give them some tea. Breaking news this week with the release of a video in which you can see a group of people killing a citizen of Tajikistan. The press service of the City Directorate of Internal Affairs has stated that it has launched an investigation into the murder on a national scale, and in the meantime, online users have recognized the typical movements seen in the video game Kolovrat, which the criminals mimicked immediately after the murder. What’s going on? You didn’t see? It’s all over the news. Someone killed a Tajik in the center, right on Tverskaya, and then they put the video on YouTube. So what? Why is everyone stuck on this? Syrian terrorists release this kind of stuff daily, so what? They used our gesture, from Kolovrat. Ooh, move your legs. Here. I hope that the cops haven’t played our game and won’t connect it to us. Yeah, but people have been commenting that the gesture is from our game, Kolovrat. Do you think the cops read the comments? First of all, you need to always hope that everyone plays our game, you’re here only for that reason. Got it? Second, I would like to remind everyone that your future at this company is dependent on the release of the 3rd Kolovrat, got it? If the game doesn’t do well, that’s it, you can look for jobs in fast food, I don’t know. - But, Zhenya, they killed someone. - So what? What do we have to do with it? - So we don’t have anything to do with it. - Absolutely nothing to do with it. Maybe we should respond to it? If we respond, the cops will come. We should sit quietly. Igor, let them come, the more fuss, the better. We aren’t responsible, we have nothing to give them. Right? We have a historical character, right? He’s saving Rus from the Tatar-Mongols, and if some dumbasses were inspired by it, then they should be the ones answering the questions, not us. Hitler loved Nietzsche and so what? That’s it! Get your heads in gear and start working, get moving. What do we have today? The endings? Maybe we should help the guy’s family somehow? - What? - We could help the guy’s family. That’s a nice thought, Liza, really, and more so, we won’t just help, Petya, are you sleeping? - Me? No. I’m not quiet. - Why are you so quiet? Who’s in charge of promoting the game, you, me, who? - Me. - Let’s make some more fuss about how in shock we are from the events that happened, how we want to help the victim’s family with some kind of big sum, and let’s make more noise, alright, take care of it. And you are going to the visit the family and give them some money, we need someone with a sympathetic face... And that would be you. Right? You did a good job and I’m a genius. And more-so, when this is over, we can announce the release date of the 3rd Kolovrat. Or maybe we shouldn’t. We’ll see. Masha! Hm, Masha, what’s wrong? You’re have some problems with your dad? He seems cool. I never had a father. I always thought how cool it was to be born and have a man love you for no reason at all. Cool. Can you take a picture? I just want to show the girls. Vanya. What’s going on with the ending? Look, in the main ending the duke sends Kolovrat from Moscow to Vladimir, so that he can take the main artifact, the wonderworking icon, for the defense of Moscow. Kolovrat leaves for Moscow. There’s a couple of options for the ending. What’s the icon? The Vladimir Virgin Mary, we already talked about it. Do we need an icon here? - Wait, you suggested that yourself. - I did? So I did a good job. Yeah, you said it yourself - take the Virgin Mary, it’s the coolest symbol, even Stalin flew around Moscow with the... - How do you call it... - The Kazan Virgin Mary. The Kazan Virgin Mary, yeah. The Kazan Virgin Mary, and then the Germans withdrew. This is the Vladimir one, it drew away Tamerlane’s forces... So we are basing this on facts... Like you told us. By the way, it's our main plot twist. We can't change it now. Check out this ending. Alright, hand me this helmet... Okay... What’s the name of this church? - Uspenskiy. In Vladimir. - It’s real? Yeah. It’s still standing. Andrei Rublev painted it. Here’s one of the endings. Kolovrat goes into the church and the icon is missing, it was stolen. Why is the text blurry? Why is the picture out of focus? That’s all we found on the internet, there wasn’t much information, there aren’t any quality photos. No photographs, right, Phillip? But there’s a church? Yeah. So what do we need to do? You need to pick up your ass and go to that damn Vladimir and photograph everything! I don’t know, is this news to you, am I discovering the New World or what? If there is a real location, then you need to go and take pictures! Is that too difficult? How far is Vladimir? 3 hours... I’ll go tomorrow, since tomorrow’s Saturday. You don’t need to go anywhere. I’ll go myself. Listen, I’m not trying to get involved, but don’t stretch this thing too much with your aggressive PR campaign, we don’t need any issues right now. We’re sitting on a bunch of loans, one wrong step, we barely found this oil mogul. - If he leaves. - He won’t leave, Igor... Don't you understand? That murder was just what we needed to untangle this game. I’ve stressed about how to go public with it, and this gift fell to us from the sky. Have I ever let you down? Relax. Go and figure out our numbers. Are you actually going to go to Vladimir? Why? I need to go somewhere, as long as I’m not sitting at home with Masha, I only get her for the weekend and she just sits quietly. It’ll pass, it’s just a phase, mine went through it. Hey, monk! Do you need a job? Breaking news this week with the release of a video in which you can see a group of people killing a citizen of Tajikistan. The video was uploaded by the criminals themselves. The press service of the City Directorate of Internal Affairs... - Will the heroine have my face? - Aren’t you an actress? - Yes. - Then that’s it. Alright. What’s the character like? A well-rounded one, like the ideal woman. She appears only when she’s needed by the man, she just smiles quietly, that’s all. - Who’s the main hero? - Kolovrat. Who’s that? He’s like Batman, but in Medieval Russia. So I’m Batman’s girlfriend? - Pretty much. - What do I do? Well, you help him save Russia from all kinds of scum... and so on, like a guardian angel. No, not an angel, a fairy. There. A fairy from the land of the elfs? Yeah. Masha’s been gone a while, can you go check on her? Come on fairy, flutter those wings. The first game of the Russian warrior Kolovrat was released in 2014 and proved to be popular amongst gamers. The owner of the company “Intergame” is Evgeniy Voigin. Intergame is one of the up and coming Russian video game companies. I am a genius. I couldn’t find her. I have a question about the character... Where’s the girl? Where did you go? How could you do that? Was it hard for you to say that I’m going outside?! Was it?! I’m fed up with these dogs! Why are you looking at me like that? I'm running around like an idiot looking for her, and she's sitting here with the dog. What are you trying to achieve? Tell me, what are you trying to accomplish? What do you want?! Say something! Speak to me! Let's go. Both of you stand here, I’ll pay and be right back. Hey! When everything is going bad, I have this one trick, it always helps, do you want me to teach you? You need to look at your problem as if you were in space. Turn around, look into the distance. Over there, and slowly start to fly away from yourself. You ready? Let’s go. Fly. Fly farther, and farther, get up real high, higher. Look at yourself from the clouds. Can you see yourself? It’s important that you do. And then get higher and higher through all of those clouds, keep flying. And now you’re in space. It’s so nice there, calm. Do you see how small you are and how small your problem is, you can’t even see it from space. You have arrived at your destination. How pretty. Why did we come now? Everything’s covered in scaffolding. Why don’t smart men believe in God? Because they are smart. That’s you. It’s your face. Who painted it? Rublev. Really. That Rublev? You can’t come inside the church when your head isn’t covered. Go, grab a shawl over there. And you take of your hat. Could you tell me who is that drawn over there? Not drawn, painted. Who-who. Christ of course. You should know that. On the right is the Virgin Mary, on the left is Christ, and in the center is God the Father. Walking around, they don’t even know the simplest things. Oh, Christ. Quickly. - So what happened? - Nothing... I’m just saying that he listens to me, do you understand, more than anyone has ever listened to me, so attentive. I think that he, I don’t know, likes me. It’s just that we connect with each other, and do you know what’s most interesting? When he said that I wanted to be an actress, he immediately gave me a part. What do you mean? Without an audition? Of course without one, he likes me! Actually, I think he’s in love with me. Work quietly! It’s just that when a man is in love, he knows what his woman wants. Can you believe it? I open Instagram this morning... And? And I have another 100,000 followers... How did you do it? I’m a magician. How much did it cost? Doesn’t matter. You wanted it, right? So I made it happen. My sweet, Father Christmas. Thanks for Father Christmas. Faggot. Hey, you animal. Stop you bitch! Bitch! Where do you think you're going? Let’s go. FREEDOM FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS. Hooray! Go faster. RUBLEVSKOE HIGHWAY. Do you know who the Rublevskoe highway was named after? Rublevka? Well, because of the ruble. Oh, my little darling. Everyone is waiting for you. - Where? - Designers room. This morning, another video was released online in which a group of criminals filmed yet another murder. This is the 2nd case this week. We would like to remind you that earlier this week, a video was released, showing the murder of a young man by a group of criminals. The main detail that ties these 2 clips together are the gestures that the criminals show at the end of the video. This gesture is from the video game character Kolovrat. What happened? Yeah. - They put it up on YouTube 2 hours ago. - Who was it this time? - A Russian. - A Russian? Well, not entirely Russian, he was gay. Gay? Turn that shit off. What did the gays do to them? Well, it seems that they decided to clean Russia entirely, not only from colored people. Except its more serious this time. Yash, show the video. They made the Kolovrat sign and called themselves the Kolovrat group. So there isn’t any doubt about the connection to the game. Dumbasses... Great, everyone who didn’t know about our game, does now. - What’s with the website? - Traffic has doubled, 5 000 000 visits. Oh, sweet. Yeah, and journalists keep calling, they all want an interview. Got it. Does everyone get what happens now? This is our chance, and we can’t let it go. Let’s try and put all of these bad thoughts away and get back to work. We aren’t tied to these killings, but we can’t not use them. Actually, we can make a little edit with the gesture and name for a teaser. - Come on, get to work, let’s go. - I'll get it done. - Is this our church? - Yes, the Vladimir Uspenskiy Cathedral. - Inside? - Yes. Let me take a look. Woah, and what’s that? The iconostasis. It looks like that? Well yeah... But that isn’t the original iconostasis. Andrei Rublev and Daniil Chernii painted that one in the 14th century, they came up with a smaller one so that it wouldn’t cover the frescoes on the walls. And in the 18th century, Catherine the Great was so enamored by the all of the beauty that she decided to replace it with a larger, gold iconostasis. I didn’t understand a thing you just said. - Rublev’s frescoes. - Right. You can’t see them because of the iconostasis. - Yeah, the iconostasis blocked them. - How is that possible? Well, they were found in 1980, pretty recently, when they were restoring the cathedral... - That’s crap. - Well, yeah. They want to hide Rublev’s Frescoes, our Russian Leonardo, right? - Yes. Yes. - This is bad. This is very bad. Bad, we’re silent. Why aren’t we doing anything about this? Why aren’t we expressing our attitude, why aren’t we saying that we are investigating the historical background in connection to our game’s theme, why aren’t we saying that for those spiritual bindings with all of our hearts and that we won’t just leave this matter be and that we will fight to have those frescoes of Andrei Rublev be opened, right? Yes. We will beat them down, those hoodlums, the church and Rublev, let them shit their pants, we’re going to be fine. Come on, let’s go, work. ANGELA. Who's calling? Oh, why are you calling me? What do you need? Yes. Calm down. Yes I went with Masha to Vladimir, so what? With what girl? There wasn’t any girl! What do you want from me, huh? We are divorced already! I’m done with you being jealous! There wasn’t... so what about Instagram? How am I supposed to know about what she posts on there? You should spend less time on there! You can’t live without it! That’s it! Idiot! What do you need? Why can’t you make it smoother, huh? You’re soaring, you need to fly, just imagine that you are really flying, you’re soaring. Why does it have to be so hard, huh? Don’t breathe, please, you’re soaring. Just get a feel for it, that you’re soaring. Damn! You don't need to jerk around like that, just fly around, gracefully. Does the word grace mean anything to you? Your arms are your wings. More smooth, more elegant, go on. - Hey Sasha. - Hey Zhenya. Are you going to torture my girl for long? How about a break? Let’s take a break, yeah. Let’s go, eat, Fairy. My girl... What’s that tattoo on your arm? - Which one? - That one. You like it? Yeah, show it. What does it mean? I don’t know, I just liked the picture. You got a tattoo which means nothing? They showed me a bunch of drawings in the shop... I just thought it was pretty. Right. - Can I ask you something? - What? Not to eat meat? No. Can you read something? Read what? I just keep thinking about what happened in the church, it was unbelievable, you, your face, Rublev, as If there was a secret that we need to solve. It’s like in “The da Vinci Code”... At first I thought that he painted a person who looked like you, but then I understood that no, he painted himself, do you get it? Painters do that, I know, because I used to paint. As it turns out, you and Rublev are the same person. Do you ever think about what you are talking about? - It’s just fact. - What fact? He died on October 17th, and in the new style it’s October 30th, your birthday, so you were born on the day he died, is that not fact? How do you know my birthday? Wikipedia. Right. It happens, that a person has one soul, like in regression. Like where? Like in regression. Did you read Newton’s “Journey of Souls”? - No. - No? Seriously, it’s a bestseller, everyone is reading it. It’s talked about in there, how you can have a seance and you are in a trance like state where you can travel into your past lives. They have these seances in Moscow. Right, so... Maybe you should check it out? I found a phone number. What’s going on in your head? Have you lost your mind, regressions, reincarnations, Buddhism, the east, look outside, we’re Orthodox here! It doesn’t matter, there is one God. Please, could you read this for me, just for a minute. It’s just that I read that sometimes knowledge from previous lives can transfer and when you’re under the affect you can talk in foreign tongues, I want to try that, actually. - You want me to be in affectus? - I’m serious... What if you can really read and understand church Slavonic. - Is it too hard for you? - It isn’t... Please, I’ll do it. She got everything ready, would you look at that, printed it out, sheets... You know they cut down trees to make sheets like this. You know that, right? Don’t you feel bad for the trees, huh, you activist? Old Slavonic yeah... Pace, pace, cherubim, in vino veritas, perpetum mobile... Yeah, total homo sapiens. It doesn’t work, not at all. Look, if he was me, yeah, I should have some sort of talent with drawing? - Yes. - Where is it? - Have you tried drawing? - No. Try it first, and then you can talk. Alright, I’m done. - Yes, Pashenka. - Hello, Zhenya... I found out something about this iconostasis, there will be a council meeting regarding the iconstasis and the reconstruction of the church, as well as Rublev’s frescoes. They’re going to decide what to do with them. Maybe we should keep quiet for now? So this council will gather right before our release, yeah? And you’re telling me to lay low? Not only are you not going to keep quiet, but you’ll do it very loudly, You’ll be so loud that they will all remember us! - Got it? Who? - I found out who the head is. The head of the council is the senator, Olga Yatsuk. Listen, organize a meeting with her... - How? - I don’t know how... Let Alina try a formal request, and you go through your contacts. Of course, the future of virtual reality is behind our games. Computers and artificial intelligence will take over most labor, and half of the population will be unemployed. All of this will fall upon the shoulders of the government. You need to understand, that a person who lives their life offline needs many things, an apartment, a car, a chick, sorry, a woman, restaurants, vacations and so on. A person who does not have these things, who does not possess the means for living will fall into depression, then the depression transforms into aggression, and the people take to the streets. Which is dangerous for the government. But a person who lives online only needs 2 things. A desk and a computer, that’s it. Therefore, in the future, it would be easier for the government to push people online, and also cheaper. And that’s where we come in. What will happen to those who are left with no jobs and live offline? There isn’t much that can happen, they will just be killed, it’s obvious. (Reading in Old Slavonic) If I speak in the tongues of men... If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong. If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or clanging cymbal. If I have, the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it’s not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; Where there are tongues, they will be stilled; Where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; Then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; Then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. And now these 3 remain: Faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. Masha’s here, she’s with the psychologist. There isn’t much that can happen, they will just be killed. - What do you mean? How? - They’ll release some kind of virus... It’s genius, yeah? The Duma has asked to check our game on the level of brutality, which can cause aggression in society, and the press is trying to tie this Slavic fascism. - Basically, loud, just like you wanted. - Great, great. It’s going too far, I think we should stop. Good, good, Phil, where are my photos? - Photos? - Well, the photos, from Vladimir? Oh, we did without them. Look. It came out great, and we recreated it perfectly. I found the movie “Andrei Rublev” by Tarkovskiy, and in that film, they restored that first original iconostasis. Wait, here, look. In the color, with everything there, check it out. Yes, that’s all very nice, but where are my photos? Look, under the left dome there should be an image of Christ, show me. Where is it? There wasn’t anything under the left dome, but I can check... Can you just give me my photos, I want to have a look. Alright. Yeah, and Vanya, I saw the ending yesterday with the fire, where did that idea come from? Our hero comes, takes the icon, and returns to Moscow, right? Well, that’s one of the endings, there’s more than one. He finds the icon in one, and in the other he was too late, and then there’s a fire. There’s no need for that, I don’t like it. He just takes it and leaves. Forget about the fire. That’s it. The photos. I see that you draw a lot of dogs... you like dogs, yeah? Your mother told me that you have an allergy on pets, so that’s why they won’t buy you a dog. Are you’re upset because of this? Bring me... what are you doing here? Masha asked me to wait for her here. She just asked you, yeah? Strange, she doesn’t ask me for anything... How’s school? Do you have any lessons that are interesting to you... You know what, I wanted to talk to you about something. The dogs are all sad. Rublev stayed silent for 15 years. 15 years and what, he didn’t paint anything during that time? Well yeah, it’s the silent vow of an artist, not just that a person doesn’t speak, it’s a protest. So Masha, why is she always silent? Because her mother and I divorced, she’s doing it to spite me. No, there has to be another reason... Maybe she’s in love? Aha, why was Rublev silent? Why don’t you go to the regression and find out... Yeah, she’s in love. With who? What are you on about? She’s too little. Yeah, of course, girls her age suffer only because of love, you can tell by her videos. Right. Interesting. And who is this scum? Why don’t I know anything about him? Yeah, hey, Zhenya! - Do you have Masha’s Instagram? - Yeah I do. Can you look up her search statistics? Right... Alright, so let’s say she has someone, why haven’t I seen him? - She hasn’t brought anyone home. - Maybe he doesn’t like her. What? That’s my daughter, how could someone not like her? Totally, she has an unanswered love, that’s where the clips are from. It’s most likely that he doesn’t love her, so that’s why she makes clips. It’s simple. What’s simple, I don’t get it. Did you always love those who love you back? Of course. So what you’re saying is that you like a girl, and she’s immediately yours? Of course, I just go and take it, is it that hard? - Yes, Pasha. - Zhenya! Masha goes on Roman Titov’s page 45 times a day on average. - Send me a link... - Of course I will. Absolutely. Pretty... Like a tattoo. Titov, 2 minutes in the box. Keep playing. Roman? - Yeah. - Hi. Evgenii Aleksandrovich. Roman, my daughter goes to school with you. You go to the 20th, right? So, she showed some Instagram pages of you and your friends, it was for work, there’s this one really awesome girl, Masha. Well, we have many Mashas. Well, it’s the one who’s quiet. - Ah, Voigina. - Yeah. Have you seen the cool clips she puts on Instagram? - No. - Really? You haven’t? Hand me your phone, I’ll show you, you didn’t see, she’s such a nice and pretty girl, I would give her some more attention if I were you. She’s quiet, but that’ll change, it’s just a dumb little protest. There, now you’re following her, will you take a look? - Yeah, I will later. - No, look at it now. No. Look. Look at how pretty it is. Like Tarkovskiy. Talent. Well yeah, Masha’s cool... - She films this herself? - Of course. But I like Alyona. - What Alyona? - Alyona Voronina from the other class. Why? I don’t know, she’s pretty. How is she pretty? How could you just like a woman for her looks, you just don’t know Masha entirely... Is everything alright in school? No bad grades? Who are you friends with in school? Good talk... Over here. Come in please. You can take of your shoes, here are some slippers, if you need them. Make yourself comfortable. You know, this is for work. I just need to know who all of this... I work with video games... so... for work... Yes, yes, of course, we’ll start. Where are you located? This street, near my office. Is there anyone else there? No, I’m alone. From where you are standing in the street, can you see the sky? Yes. And now I want you to find a cloud in that sky. And you will see that cloud coming down towards you. It falls down gently, towards you, and wraps around you. And now you are in this cloud, but this cloud is made of a special mist, the mist of time. And at one moment you become one with the mist of time, and gradually inside this mist there begins to form another physical body, which was at one point important in a previous life. And when that mist dissipates, you can find yourself in another time and space, in another point in history, but you realize that it is still you. The mist carries you to another body, into another important life, which you must open today. What does it look like? What appears before you? A wall... just a wall. - A wall? - Yes. Alright. Now look at your feet. What are you wearing? The first thing that comes to mind. Nothing. Barefoot. What clothes are you wearing? I don’t know. Like a monk. In robes. What time period is this? What era? I don’t know. Not ours. And time goes by faster and you appear there where you need you be. Where are you going? I’m walking in line with the wall, it’s probably a monastery, a very high wall. I’m going, going, it’s a never ending wall. I’m going. I got out. A snowy place. Look at your hands. What are they like? Dirty. No, that’s paint. In paint. Is there something in your hands? Brushes. Good. And where are you going in this field? What are you feeling? Fear. Because it’s a never-ending field, I’m just going, I know that I must go. And time goes by faster and faster and you come upon the place where you needed to go, you crossed that field quite fast and appear where you were going. A cathedral. What does it look like? It’s big, beautiful. Alright. Now you are inside the church, look around. What do you see? What are you feeling, what are you doing there? Everything is white. Pretty. I’m just looking around. Imagining. Scared to start. Start what? To paint the church. That’s why I was brought here. And how will you paint it? I don’t know yet, no ideas. I’m struggling, I can’t decide. Is there someone who understands and will help you? Yes. My friend. He knows when I need help. It’s a difficult task. When does this friend come? He comes on his own. We are always together. How does he look? Cherniy. Black hair? No. His last name is Cherniy. And he is your friend? Yes. In that life. And in all my lives. In all your lives? And in this one, this person, this soul, could you identify it? Maybe among those you know, those around you. Strange... why her? She doesn’t fit me at all. Who doesn’t fit you? - She. - Who is she? A girl. I found her outside half-naked dressed as a piece of meat. So this girl is that soul that is in your present life? Yes. And what is her name? Fairy. Just a couple more steps and we are there. I want to say that this building was constructed at the end of the 19th century. The stairs are from that time. A merchant of the first guild, Vyacheslav Sashko, owned the building. He planned on opening a textile shop for his own fabrics. And we are basically here. We got everything ready because we weren’t sure what you exactly needed. Here you can see a great sketch-book, this is natural wood, canvas, various paints, here you have oil paints, acrylic, which I recommend because it dries quickly. Gouache, for beginners. We also have pastels, wine and whiskey for inspiration. Brushes, the brushes are also elite, from elite wood, and most importantly, you can take this all with you. And this... This... is our nude model. Here is our Flemish still-life, and behind the window our wonderful urbanistic landscape. We got lucky with the weather today, by the way. Thank you, I’m fine on my own. - Yes, of course. - And I don’t, need... that. Ah, so the landscape it is. Good. - Natalya, let’s go. If anything... - Thank you very much. Yes, all right. No to the game. No to the game. No to the game. No to the game. Pasha, What’s going on with the senator, did you manage to set up a meeting? No, we couldn’t get a meeting since you’re a star now, your photo is on every corner, and after that interview, they don’t want to see you at all. - Right. - Wait. I managed to dig something up. Our senator, Olga Yatsuk, attention... plays Kolovrat. - I don’t get it. - Well, money was taken off her card. Maybe she doesn’t play. Look. She has a son. 18 years old. He plays games 24 hours a day. Our client. Dig up all the information you can on this kid. - Wait. Do we need him? - I need his mother, and there doesn’t seem to be any other outlet to her. What’s his name? There's the bastard. Come here. Please don't. I'm begging you. Beat him. Let’s move to that day and to that time that was at one point important for you. It’s some kind of war or invasion. I don’t know. It’s scary. People killing people. Everything is burning. Everyone is being killed. Everything is being destroyed. It’s very scary. Where are you at this point in time? We are hiding in the church. Is your friend with you? Yes. He’s with me. We are hiding together. Remember the most important moment for you in this war. Everything is burning. My works. They are burning everything. The icons. They are burning. No one needs them anymore. You can see this? Yes. What did you do after this? I went silent. And I didn’t paint for many years after. I didn’t see any point. - Many years? - Yes. Why did you start again? I realized that I had to, that I had no right to stay silent. What did you paint? This work. Which one? What is portrayed on it? Love. Evgenii Voigin. - Hello. - Hello. Don’t get up, sit. - Did Masha fall asleep quickly? - Yes. We made dinner together, she ate and fell asleep. Good. Did you eat yourself? - Yes. - Right. What’s the hurry, sit with me for a bit. Thanks for helping out. I’m glad to. I see that you went into this pretty seriously. When I look at his works I sometimes think that I should have kept painting. It’s so pretty. Yes, it’s pretty. This painting is considered the brightest face of Christ in the whole world, can you believe it? - This one? - This one. Didn’t I see it somewhere? Where did you see it? Well, I don’t know, why? No, nothing. It’s considered to be a miracle-working icon. Where is it now? In the museum, the Trityakovka. Oh, I probably saw it there. Is it not a miracle-working icon now? There’s probably be a lot of people who would want to see it. Now people probably don’t believe anymore, or they forgot. It’s just a painting in a museum. But actually, that isn’t the main thing about this icon. Before, people were frightened of a terrible judgement, God was portrayed in a completely different way. God is always reproachable, scolding, like some kind of mean old man. He was the first to portray Christ like a human being. Can you believe it? No one painted like this before him. He had his own unique idea of the terrible judgement, and you know what it was focused on? Forgiveness and love. Can you believe it? And love, was the most important thing. - I’ll order a taxi. - Aha. I read some more about reincarnation and I found out that if you completed your life’s mission, then in the next life, you go up to the next step. I was thinking, what would you need to do, after him, after Rublev. You probably shouldn’t search for something in the same area. If you were already a painter, and more so - a genius, you need to do something, or else it ends up being kind of weird. You were born to kill all kinds of evil spirits, after him, after Rublev. It is kind of strange. I make the best video games in the country. Is that not enough? No. But you are rich, you have opportunities, you’re kind, you need to use that somehow. I’m not kind, I just make the best games. What do you mean, not kind? You’re kind. You saved my life, that means you can... I can’t do anything. I make the best games in the country. - Is that not enough? - No, it’s enough. It’s just that he changed the world. Bye. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 11, 12... - Oh, Roman, hey. - Hi there. How are things going in your personal life, nothing changing? Well yeah... there’s Alyona, the one I told you about. The one on the trampoline? The blonde one? You know, girls like your Alyona aren’t that hard to get. 3 tries. No, in 2. Maybe in 1. You got work to do. Send her a bouquet, but not a picture. Buy her flowers. Tell her that she’s the best, got it? - Got it. - Get to work. What can you comment about the murders? What can you comment about the murders? - Aleksei Kondrashov? - That’s me. Thank you for coming. We have been expecting you. - I don’t understand what’s going on. - I’ll explain everything to you. As I understand you have been playing our games your whole life, right? - Aha. - So, do you like them? - Aha. - Aha. Alright. Happy Birthday! Hooray! One second, your attention. Everyone meet Aleksei Kondrashov... You’re 18, right? - Aha. - 18 years. Loyal service, for more than half of your life, yeah? Congratulations, you are one of our best players. You don’t sound happy? - Who trains you? - Kind of on my own. - On your own, no way. - Yeah. Self-made, huh. You say they can’t do it, and here we have people doing it on their own. As you understand, we didn’t call you here for no reason, we have an offer that will change your life forever. No, first let’s drink for the new member of our team. - Hip-hip, hooray! - Hooray! - Good job, congratulations. - Congratulations. Congratulations - Thank you. Careful. Alright, on the couch. - What’s going on? - Hi there. What’s wrong with him? Nothing, the boy drank, he’ll sleep it off, everything will be OK. - Take the keys. - Who are you? A friend. Do you have any idea what your son does in his free time, - or do you not care? - What does he do? Does the name of the fascist group Kolovrat? Should I tell you about all their killings or have you been informed about the situation already? I know about them. Did you know that your son is part of their group? - That’s crap. - You didn’t know, yeah? That can’t be true... I recognized you, what do you need? I need your help. Of course. Come in, let’s talk. You are the head of the research council concerning the Uspenskiy Cathedral, right? - Yes, and what? - Do you know what it’s for? Somewhat. Alright, I’ll keep it short. Rublev painted the cathedral in the beginning of the 15th century, a distinguished artist. Excuse me, I’m just very tired. He painted it, not on his own, not on his own, he painted it with his friend Daniil Cherniy. In the 1970’s when there was a restoration of the church, there were some Rublev frescoes found on the walls, do you remember? They were hidden behind the iconostasis, or covered, because that iconostasis wasn't the original. Rublev and Cherniy thought up the original, and it was small and stood in the center, and did not ruin the harmony of the interior, and subsequently all of the works, frescoes, were seen to everyone. Only in the 18th century was the new iconostasis put up by Catherine the Great, and it was huge and golden, and hid the frescoes until the 1970’s, but no one decided to do anything about it then. Yes, to leave it as it is, with a very stupid explanation, to leave those frescoes behind the iconostasis, in the shade, in order to help preserve them from the sunlight. That is total crap, because it is a work of art, you can’t just hide it. And now it’s being restored again and again the question stands, that is why the council was formed, which you head, and forgive me for reiterating the fact that you are the head of the council. I understand that you are very busy but... I don’t understand what you want. I want you to make the right decision. I want, I don’t know, for this one to be put away, or make it smaller, or maybe move it to another church, and to put up the iconostasis that Cherniy and Rublev thought up. You understand that if a great artist paints pictures, then the people must see them? They must be opened. And we can make this happen. - We? - Yes. Why do you need this? I don’t know. I don’t know why. Why do I need this? Well you do want to save your son? You do realize what will happen when all of this gets exposed, and everyone will find out that your son is a murderer? You will be destroyed. Listen, he can still be saved. So tomorrow, you can shout at him and argue with him, but it won’t change anything. You understand that perfectly. He can leave the group in only one condition, if he wants to leave himself. This needs to happen as soon as possible. If they’re not exposed today, it’ll happen tomorrow, and no one will be able to save them. I have a plan, how we can help him leave that organization... I'm offering you a deal. If I'm able to... If Alexei leaves this organization, then you must promise me that the council will make the right decision, okay? It will be our little deal. You can be the best, but for that to happen you need to turn away from everything else, parties, people, friends; You need to focus entirely on the game. In a week there’s going to be the group lottery, listen to me carefully, group lottery, you’re going to work as a beta tester, we’ll see what you’re capable of, and then we can talk about e-sports. - Deal? - Aha. You’re going to test our games right here in the office, and you’re going to write down any comments about the game. You’ll play 24 hours a day, without breaks. Don’t expect it to be easy, if you start complaining, see you later. - I won’t start. - What? - I won’t start. - We’ll see, we’ll see. - They called me in. - One second. Hey. - Do you like it? - Yeah. Yours. Mine? Well yeah, you said that you paint, so I thought of you. I used to paint. Start again, not everyone needs to run naked around Moscow. Moreover, winter is coming. Thank you. Show me later what you came up with, alright? Alright, I’ll go, I won’t ruin your moment. Listen here, “moment”, come here. You’re going to grab all of this and you’re going to help the young lady take it home. So. - Hey. - Ooh, presents. - My name is Masha. - Hey Masha, I’m Aleksei. This is Aleksei, we work together. He helped me carry this stuff. Do you want some tea? No, I got some stuff to do. Why, come in, we got a nice cake. Yeah, fine. Take your shoes off. - Let’s go. - Let’s go. Hey, this is Aleksei, we work together. - Aleksei. - Alisa. Nice to meet you. I don’t get it, what is going on. I still think that he loves me. Look, I just talked about wanting to paint again and look at everything he got for me, this proves that he loves me, since he connects with me so well. He’s so gentle towards me. He’s the most handsome man in the world. This is all so paltry... Do you watch the news at all? Do you realize that in a year ISIS could have a nuclear weapon, do you understand what that means? And the climate, global warming... as a matter of fact, we haven’t protested against that in any way. Do you realize what will happen to the Earth if we don’t reduce pollution into our atmosphere? I can understand that, a global problem, it’s actually scary, and you’re worried about love. How are you not ashamed of yourself? I’m not. Maybe there won’t be anything left, no world, no people, that’s what you need to think about. - So you work for Tanya? - Well yeah, with her. - What do you do? - I’m a beta tester. Why do I need this world if he doesn’t love me. Thank you. Love to my heart. Where are we? Andronnikov monastery, it says it right there. This is where Rublev died, this is where they were buried, in one grave. In one grave? That’s what they decided, Andrei Rublev, Daniil Cherniy, they wanted to be buried together, you didn't know? No. I read that Maya Plisetskaya asked for her ashes to be mixed with Rodion Shedrin’s ashes and that they be buried together, when he died. - He died? - No. I don’t know. To be honest, it’s a cool idea, I would want my ashes to be mixed with the ashes of the person who I love. Only if he loves me as well. Where’s their grave? No one knows. There used to be a bell house and they were buried next to it, at least that’s what they asked for. After the pogrom’s everything was burned down and the bell house was taken apart. Their bodies were moved, and buried in the church under the altar. At least that’s what they say. What are we looking for? Nothing. I just want to figure out where the bell house would be? It could have been here, yeah? It could have. - Or over there. - Yes. What do you think? I don’t know. Your intuition isn’t saying anything? - It is. - What? What am I supposed to think? Nothing. Let’s go inside. Hello there. Hello. Anatoliy Vertkov, Investigative Committee. Pleased to meet you, have you come to arrest me? It’s up to you. As I can tell, you don’t fully realize what you got yourself into? Listen, I’m a regular person, I make computer games. - What questions might you have for me? - Well that won’t last long. As far as I know there’s a document being prepared that will ban the game Kolovrat inside Russia. Really? It’s just a game. Kolovrat is a Russian hero, a historical figure as well. Leave it for the judge. The judge? Can you show me something perhaps? It’s possible that you are in contact with criminals, and you are keeping that from us. They are all your fans, and play your game. Hundreds of thousands of people play my game, so what? They do, and then they are inspired, go into the streets, and kill. And you don’t care. Listen, don’t start with this. No, but maybe they decided to contact their idol? I’m not their idol, I don’t know these people. Then what were you doing in the club Arena? Yes, I was in that club, I saw some tattoos of the Kolovrat symbol on the arms of some people there. Did you get that? So this fascist swastika is your symbol, is that what you mean? It’s an ancient Russian symbol. Kolovrat calls upon the god of the wind to create a protective sphere around him and his companions. Do you visit these establishments often? I love real life, I’m scared to lose contact with reality. I need to know about my players, about their wishes, goals, so it’s fine, I sometimes walk in the metro, or go into establishments like that. It’s important to keep things in check. I observe. There are plenty of your players in prison; You’ll have time to observe. Why are you trying to intimidate me? I’m not intimidating you... I came to make a deal with you. Everything is in your hands, but one wrong move and you will lose everything. I’m willing to come to an agreement, you tell me everything you know about these guys, everything, you know I can see that you know something and I don’t understand why you are hiding it, are these murderers related to you? There was another body found in the park today, this time it was just a hobo. They don’t like hobos either, these cleaners, 173 knife wounds, cut off head. Tomorrow they will get to you and your children. Listen, your game will be banned soon, and that’s merciful enough. We can make it difficult by accusing you of committing a federal crime, or we can do something completely different - you give up everything you know and the plan changes, we give you our thanks for your cooperation, we leave you in peace and your game is released. I don’t have any information for you, Anatoliy. In front of a black sky. It's filled with organs, the sky... - Hi there. - Hi there. - Hi there. - Hi there. Who is this? This is Masha. She’s the neighbor of your actress, Tanya. But she’s leaving soon. Are you Tanya’s neighbor? Yes, we’re renting the place together. You also fight for word peace? - Well yeah. - Does it work? Almost. Is it okay if I take this young man from you for a minute? Of course not. Let’s go. Let’s go... Come here. I see that you made yourself comfortable, you invited her on a tour? - Am I not allowed? - No, you are. Does she know what you do? What I do? Does she know that you are a fascist, that you kill people? Huh? I don’t think this fighter for the world would want anything to do with you once she finds out. - She won’t find out. - How could she not. She will. You want me to tell her right now. Please. - Quiet. Your hands. - I don’t want to. Soon everyone will know. How did you know? We do background checks for all employees, what did you want? You’re a normal, good, and talented person, you have a lot of potential. But you can’t fucking stay in that fascist organization. And you bitches took the name of my game. I haven’t given you up yet. You can either leave that Kolovrat and we take you into our team, and you stay with Masha, and live happily ever after, or I won’t see your face here ever again and she will find out everything about you, who and what you are, with all of the subsequent consequences. - Fine. - Fine, what? - Fine, what? - Nothing. - I’ll think about it. - No, you won’t think about it. You’re going to go there today and you will say that you are leaving them. Does it have to be today? Masha and I wanted... You are going to go today and you will tell them that you are leaving. No, not an option. I won’t find them today. I know that in 2 days they’re having a big meeting at 9 at Sportivnaya. - I can go there. - Do you not get what I’m telling you? There is no tomorrow, or day after tomorrow. Today. You will go there, and tell them that you are leaving. As you wish, I guess I’ll tell her. Okay. - Deal. - Deal. - You sure? - I’m sure. - Today? - Today. - Fine. - Just don’t tell Masha. Deal. Come here. Look. - That’s me? - Yes. - Do you like it? - Yes. It’s just that you said it was a fairy, but I’m more of a hairy bird. It’s just that I imagined it differently. No, it’s still in development now, right? - Vitya Bite is coming on Monday. - You see, it’ll be ready Monday. - What’s today, Friday? - Aha. Oh, so today we have to celebrate, we deserve it because we did a good job, we did a massive thing, right? Of course. Fairy, do you know how to party? Hey. - We're here, ladies, out you go. - Zhenya. - Zhenya. What took you so long? - Oh, hi. - It’s packed in there. - What did you expect? Holy Friday. - We’ll get in. - Zhenya. - Zhenya. - One second. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Who’s that? - Those are cyborgs. - Cyborgs? Cyborgs... these beings, who can dance nonstop. - We came to dance, right? - Yeah. Are they not people? Why? They are greater. Let’s go. Can I ask you something? - What? - Who am I then? You’re my teammate. I thought that you love me. Ladies, don’t stand in the road. Of course I do, of course. I love you, like any brother, and maybe even stronger. Why are you so serious, we came to dance, right? Just wait, just wait. This is your warm up? You’re buying yourself out? No. This is from the heart, thanks for everything. You’re leaving yourself, cool. - Well, yeah. - We need to send you off somehow. No, it’s fine, there are people waiting for me, I’ll go. Yeah? Where will you go? We won’t even be able to say bye to you? Are we not human? It’s fine. We’ll say goodbye properly. We’ll go take care of some business in your honor. - No, I can’t. - Are you saying no? No. It’s in your honor. I need to make a call. You can call later, it’ll only be for half an hour. Who’s the victim? Alright, we need to make everything fast. Like in the Olympic jackets. - And black. - Yeah, black. Black, wait let me write it down. Who's going to run? - Can you write "no to sexism". - A free woman in a free Russia. Tanya, did you choose what you’re getting? - There's no point in all of this. - What? There's no point in all of this. I didn’t get it, can you be clearer? Are you tucking tail and running? - I haven’t tucked tail. - Then what? It’s just that there’s no point to all of this. So you are tucking tail, yeah? Do you know how important every person is, do you know how much we prepared for this? This is important for all us, for all of us seated here. And you’re the smart one who comes in and says there’s no point to this. - And you are tucking tail and leaving. - I’ll come. But this is my last time, I’m not participating after this. He dumped you? Listen, have you seen Aleksei, I’ve been calling him and he isn’t picking up. All men are the same. The body of the son Duma senator Olga Yatsuk was found early this morning. He suffered multiple stab wounds to the abdomen. This has been one of a string of murderes by the infamous group Kolovrat. The murderers have already released the video of the young man’s death. The creators of the game Kolovrat are still denying and connection to the criminal group. Nevertheless, a document was signed this morning in the Duma, banning any copy of the game Kolovrat in Russia. A criminal case under the article of extremeism has been raised. The investigating authorities have stated that all necessary measures will be used in order to uncover the group in the near future. Meanwhile, outrage... Vanya, what is this? - The cathedral. - Which cathedral? The Uspenskiy, ours, what other one? That’s not it. That’s a different one. What? Guys this isn’t our cathedral. Zhenya, how could it not be when it is. The Uspenskiy Cathedral in Vladimir, painted by Rublev. I’ll look it up on the internet one more time if you want. Wait, wait. Here. This is our church, there, that’s where we were. What is this? Phil, put this in the GPS, Uspenskiy Cathedral in Vladimir. Look at what comes up. Here, this is our church. There are 2 of them, there’s one that is within the Ducal woman’s monastery, but it’s just a small little church, with the same name, that’s all. Here, look, Zhenya. Here is the Uspenskiy, here is the second one. That one isn’t ours at all. Why are you here? What do you need? I came to bring his hat. He forgot it. I should have predicted that they wouldn’t let him go. It’s simple stuff, do you understand? Do you understand how much of a moron I am? I don’t get why they even filmed that scary looking fairy at all. We wasted so much time... Maybe they’ll use it. No, they won’t, I heard Phil say that they never even planned on her being in the game. The boss brought her in, just so that she could spend time with his daughter, that’s all. Yeah, Zhenya is really strange. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here, we finished filming? What do you mean? That’s it, it’s the last day, we aren’t filming anymore. When should I come? You don’t need to anymore, there won’t be any more filming. I’m not needed anymore. Well yeah. - Were you paid? - Yeah. - Super. - Cool. Super, yeah. So that’s it, take your money and see you later? You think you can just use me and throw me away, that’s it, I’m not needed? You think I don’t know that this was because of Masha, so that I could spend time with her, you just came up with this fairy, she didn’t exist. You just used me, you used me! Are your hormones out of wack? Yeah, maybe I’m not as pretty as your cyborgs, what you think I don’t have a soul, that I don’t have a heart, you’re wrong, I do have a soul, I do have a heart, and it’s big. You can’t do this to me. Why did you ask me to go clubbing? You could have not asked me and went with them, but you did, and you saw that I was hurt, I was really hurt, you are really cruel, you aren’t kind. Listen, did I ever promise you anything? No, you didn’t promise me anything, you didn’t give a damn about me, as if, as if I wasn’t a real person, as If I don’t have feelings. Can I not be loved, just because I’m not that pretty like them, because I’m ugly? That’s it, quit this performance, get out of here. I’m not going anywhere. Because you ruined everything. Me, you, Rublev. It was something special, these secrets, it was ours, and you went ahead and ruined it all. I’ve had it with your Rublev! You are a sick schizophrenic. There is no Rublev, we weren’t in the Uspenskiy Cathedral. We didn’t see his work, because we were in a different church. Your damn GPS took us to a different place. To a different church where Rublev never painted. Do you understand? We weren’t there! - Phil, did you find the photos? - Looking for them. Don’t. All of it is just this schizophrenic’s fantasies. All crap. And that guy is dead. And that isn’t a fantasy anymore. That is all you. Not me, you. Get out of here. What do you plan on doing with this little friend? It’s for Masha. Where is she by the way? Alina, where’s Masha? Who did she leave with? - Where did they go? - To the cafe, on the first floor. Why the hell did you let her go? She’s always with Tanya, I thought you knew. There was a little girl here, where? Listen here, if you don’t bring Masha back to the office, I’ll dig you into the ground, you bitch. Just bring back Masha, that’s it. Bring her back. Pasha, send me her address. That bitch, where she lives. Yeah, alright, I’m waiting. Where is my child, huh? - I took her home. - You’re lying. Where’s Masha? - Home, home. - Where’s Masha? Let her go! - Good evening. - Galya, where is Masha? - Masha is at home, eating. - Show me. Were you not planning on picking her up today? - I’ll call later. - Alright. If you touch her again, I’ll kill you. I don’t want to see you again. Zhenya? - Everything is fine, she’s home. - I'm glad. - What should I do with the dog? - With the dog? Hello, Zhenya... - Zhenya? - Call the cops, tell them that at 9... there’ll be a group meeting of Kolovrat at the metro Sportivnaya. - Got it? Get to it. - Understood. Yeah, and do me a favor, can you bring the dog home. That’s all. No, that’s not all. Write a note, I’ll dictate. Attention, doors closing. You don't have any allergies! Stop moving! Hands on your head! Now let’s move on to the very last day of that life. It’s tied to the bell tower. What’s going on there? New bells. They put it in the tower. A new one. And how does your soul feel about this? I’m happy about it. A nice ring. It’s nice, calm. I’m leaving in love. What is the place like where you are dying? Ringing the bells is FORBIDDEN. God bless. It’s some kind of monastery, a church. And now your soul will see the place where your body will be buried. Look at it. What is it? What kind of place? Where is it? It’s near the bell tower, almost under it. Did you ask for this? Looks like I did. Was it important to be near the belltower? Yes. Why? I don’t know. I just like the sound. We wanted it probably. I don’t know. And your friend, is he by your side when you are dying? No, he isn’t there. Look, again that sign, like my tattoo, what does it mean? - It’s the 6 winged Seraphim. - Who is he? He is an angel who is always by Christ. I always say that I am an angel. And is that friend by your side today? Yes. Why are you so sure of it? I just know it.
