[engine sounds] - These streets are unforgiving. If you guys don't got it, get back on the fucking porch now. They call me Circus. But I ain't here for entertainment. Now when you cross this fucking bridge, it's a whole different world. A world we're fucking renegade thugs. prey on the weak. Take advantage of the helpless and hurt their own. And make no mistake, anyone that sees this cut, and hears the sound of that harley, know the Skulls run this fucking town. - They call me Hip Hop. And I shot call everything, from 10th to 29th. I and I alone say what shake and what don't. Whatever happen on the West side, shit don't matter to me. They can ride them bikes up and down Detroit all they want. As long as I don't see them shits on the 12. But the minute they forget, the second they get out of pocket, we let em know what the 12 about. Anybody who don't understand peace, gon' have to understand violence.

I'm serious Fazon. I need you to move it the same way we've been doing for the last three years. No new customers, no new connections. - Alright man. Them country boys saying they can get twice as much as we getting now, and cheaper. - Stall that shit man. We ain't in a position to be switching teams right now. Plus the deal we got with the Skulls is keeping us good. Take this money to the Skulls, and bring the work straight to Greasy. - bet. - Straight to Greasy Fazon. - Alright. Real talk.

Now show me the fucking money. - Oh, alright, alright, easy Hill Billy Jack. - We got it for ya. Just like we promised. One pound of 96% pure Methamphetamine This here's class 'A' chip. The best glass in Tennessee - Well give me the fucking product so I can get out of this damn truck. Fuck are y'all, pig farmers or something. - [Toothpick Man] It's all there.

Let's just finish this deal and both of us be on our merry fucking way. I'm not gonna tell you what's gonna happen to either of us, when he finds out that A, we was hustling on his turf and B, somebody from Twelve Block's been buying from us. - Look, y'all can worry about whoever the fuck y'all need to worry about. Let me worry about little ol' me. Twelve Block don't bar nobody, not even him. - I hate those fucking bangers. - Wait, wait oh wait. Wait let me explain and make this right. No, no, look, I was just about to come see you. I got this package for you man? - Is that right? - Yeah. Look, that's all you. You can keep it, all of it. - Yeah. - Yeah.

[gun fires] - [Man] Mr. Costanzo. - Mr. Costanzo. - [Man] Mr. Costanzo. - Mr. Costanzo. - [Woman] Mayor - Mayor - Mayor Costanzo any comments on the recent rash of gang murders here in the city? - Look, myself along with the state and local officials are doing everything we possibly can, to once and for all bring down the mobs in this city. And the street gangs that aid in their illegal activity. - But do you think there will be a significant impact made against the Lione Crime family who's operated for nearly 30 years, under your watch might I add. - Myself and everybody I employ at City Hall are doing the best we can to make this a safer city. And any notion that I'm in bed with this, Lione family, is disrespectful and incorrect. - Mayor, the bodies are piling up from escalating gang wars, what can you tell the citizens of Cleveland to calm their fears? - I am doing the absolute best that I can. Now excuse me, your mayor has to go to work. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. - That's all the questions for today thank you. - Thank you, thank you very much. [phone rings] - Chief Crans. - Chief, chief this is your mayor. Listen, I want a show of force in every gang neighborhood in this city and I want it now, you understand, I want it now. - I got enough shit on my plate already. - I don't give a damn what you got on your plate. You pile some more on your plate and then you get it done, you understand. - Fucking politicians. â™ªRap Music - Dawg them niggas ain't getting no money. - Bullshit, them niggas getting money for years. - Dawg, them niggas ain't getting no money man. - Now how do you know that though? - Fuck y'all got on Fazon? - Not much dawg. No witnesses, no prints, whoever did it, is a ghost bro. - Oh we know who did it. He was supposed to meet up with Circus to pick up that work. It had to be the Skulls man. - Man ain't no doubt it was them. We did just like you said. Stayed off their ass till you got out of jail. - Well, now I'm here. My first day out and I already got to put in work. - Chill. Me and Rico can handle this men. - Nah man. Fazon wasn't just Twelve man, he was blood. I'mma deal with this one myself. - Yo but Hop, how you know it was the Skulls though? Ain't the only crew we beefing with out there. - Man no other gang in the city got the nuts to turn up like that. - But you had to know that shit was gonna happen sooner or later though right dog? - I don't care about none of that shit man. My nigga dead and somebody gon' answer for that. - So you blame it on the Skulls without concrete proof huh? Wow. - Nigga is you a Skull? Cause if you are I'mma bleed your ass out right here and now. Mail your heart back to your mom and little brother back in Oakland nigga. - Look men, Hop, I'm just saying. - Nigga, don't just say shit. Keep your thoughts to yourself, please. This shit done popped off man. And nobody, I don't care how motherfucking deep their crew is or who they connected with, ain't nobody getting away with killing a Twelve. - Well it's up to you my nigga. I could round up the crew right now and start trimming them niggas. - [laughs] man you ain't gon' start trimming no damn body. How the fuck you gon' go to war in some damn dress shoes huh? Tell me that you pretty ass nigga. - Keep on joking. I'mma start with you. - Ooh, I'm scared. Im shaking Boy I'll come on over there and slap that S curl out yo' damn head - look, both of y'all calm down. This ain't a motherfucking game. - Man them boys deep. And that fool Circus, he stay guarded at all times man. I mean, yeah, you may get a few of him here and there but, it's gon' be tough for us to win an all out street war man. They got numbers on their side. - I know that man. But we can still make it work. - [Greasy] How? - By catching em all in one place at one time. Talk about Circus, Tommy Boy, Cassie, all em'. Even their supplier Mr. Calvetti. - No no, that ain't gon' be easy thing men. I mean, it's one matter waring with another gang man, but you're talking about taking on the mob. Nigga they got police on payroll. So we gotta take it to the mattresses as shit get thick, it's definitely gonna blow back on us man. - You're right. But I got a plan. We lure em all out, deal with em all at once. Let me worry about that. - [Ishmel] Alright mama I'm going. - Okay you go now. - [Ishmel] Hmm hm. - Ohh look at me boy, you just look so handsome today. - Oh come on mama, why do you have to make it such a big deal, I'm just going to work. - Me just so proud of me boy, there's no harm in that. I baked you some cookies. - Mama, you have to stop with the cookies and the pies, you really do. - You just don't understand. I'm just so thankful that they found my son a job. It's not everyday that you bump into a complete stranger and he helps us find a home and gives us both jobs. - And gives us both jobs. - Mama, do you know you say this everyday? - Listen, me can fuss over me boy as me want, now you go. Aren't you forgetting something? - I love you mama. - I love you too. - And I thank you. - You're welcome baby. [slow lively music] - alrighgt I'll talk to you later. What are you doing here? - I came to talk to you. - About what? - Getting put on the Twelve. - It's just that simple Ish. I mean you've been wanting to get put on the hood since you moved in man. Well here's your chance But first, you gotta show us you Twelve Block material and you're worthy of wearing these colors. I mean you do want to wear these colors don't you? Then all you gotta do, is get your boss to the meeting. I know you're surprised that Mr. Calvetti is really a capo in the mob. - But he's been so good to my family. - Dawg, that cock socking cracker been bleeding this neighborhood dry for years man. You think you really matter to him? To him, you're just another nigga willing to work for damn near free. Look Ish all you gotta do is what I ask. Approach him with an opportunity to get in on the drug trade back in Haiti. Tell him your people got it locked up down there. They just need a steady connect to move. - But he knows I'm not a dealer. - Yeah, just like you knew he wasn't a gangster right? Look, when you first approach him, he'll be caught off guard. But if you speak strong and direct, lock in on his eyes, speak confident, he'll go for it. - So I just have to get him to the meeting. - That's it Ish. - You get him to the meet, and we'll convince him to do business with us. Nobody gets hurt, everybody goes home happy. And most importantly, you get put on the Twelve. - When? - And you believe this kid? - I mean what are you gonna do? Kid comes up to me, says he's got a connection, wants to do some serious business. I gotta listen. - Is this a street kid? - [Calvetti] Not at all. - A cop? - No way, he's a good kid. Matter of fact I think he's trying to impress me. Or maybe he's trying to make a few extra dollars. But either way, I do think he has the connect. - Okay. Alright, let's meet with these Hiatians and see what they got. And you take Circus and his crew with you for protection. I don't want this shit going South. - I'll take care of it. [upbeat music] - Alright mamma, I'm just gonna go out with some friends, I'll be back a little later. - Son, who are these friends of yours and where did you meet em? - Mother what difference does that make? - Ishmel. - Mom, look you have to stop treating me like a baby. - Ishmel listen to me. These boys are bad. You really don't want-- - Don't what? Don't want to have friends? Mom do you know all I do is go to work or I come here at home, up under you all day. And that's no way to live. I have to start hanging out with people my own age. - Son, me just don't want you to go and do exactly what we left behind in Haiti. - What we left behind in Haiti, that is not my life. Look ma, I know you love me, O'k But I am old enough and strong enough to make my own decisions. Now look, I have to go, I'll be back later. - Ishmel. - Mom, I have to go. - Ishmel. â™ª [rap music] Look lil bro, run it just like we talked about everything will be good, alright [soft piano music] Well now Dorothy, ain't you a long way from Kansas? So, where's your posse at? Where's the mighty Hiatian cartel? - They'll be here any minute. - So where's your friends? - They'll be here in a second. - I'm a busy man Ishmel. Now exactly who are we meeting up with again? - Some friends, from back home. - Well it just turns out, I actually know some people from back home, who knows, it might be one of them. It's about time. - Hello Mr. Calvetti. - Oh you done fucked up now Dorothy. - I wouldn't do that if I was you. Put it down. Or my boys will put a slug right through your boss' pretty blue eyeball. - What the fuck do you want? - I came here for your life? - Excuse me? - I said I came here for your life. But I'll take an understanding. All I want is the East side. Your family can keep the West side and anything downtown, plus the no man's land in the middle. I think that's fair. - You think that's fair. Listen here you little punk, I was pushing dope in these streets when you and your fairy ass crew were playing hop scotch in the projects. So don't you dare try telling me what's fair. - Well I really don't see you having a choice right now do you? - Uhhn, you got it all figured out. You know all the angles. Young man, it doesn't work out that way. You cut us out, you're cutting out the Donatos, the Merlinos and a few other families back East who aren't particularly looking for a pay cut, you get it? - Like I said, I think it's more than fair given the circumstances. - [italian talk] fuck you. [gun fires] [gun fires] [gun fires] - I want everybody on standby. If they're big enough to hold a fucking gun, put them on alert, the shit just got real. What the fuck, is that Ishmel's mother? - Oh no. No. I brought me boy to America to escape the violence of Hiati. For a better life. Me wanted to start over. But you all have taken that away. And now, there must be payment. And you must pay in trade, a life for a life. [speaks foreign language] [siren sounds] - [Pretty] Let's roll - Ma'am, we have been here for two hours, two hours. Now I'm starting to loose my fucking patience. Now we are trying to find the men who killed your son. Now come on, you want me to believe that you walked into an alley by accident, right into a triple homicide. You want me to believe that. I can't buy that. Now tell me what happened. - Boy left home that night with that rowdy bunch. And yes I did, I followed him. I tried to make sure there'll be no harm to me boy. Cause he's a good boy, he's not at all like those men he was with tonight. - Did you know any of the men he was with? - No, I don't. - Ma'am I've got dead gang bangers. I've got another man who's a high ranking member of the biggest mob family in this city. Ma'am, they killed your son. Help us find these bastards please. Come on! Help us out here! Jesus Christ! - Mrs. Babbitt, help us identify the men that were in that alley. - Ma'am, can you give me and my partner a moment to speak in private? - We got nothing to hold her on really. We got to cut her loose and hope that she has maybe a change of heart and gives us something. - It's just one thing that bothers me. - What's that? - How does someone like Ishmel Babbitt connect to somebody like Charles Calvetti? - We still gotta cut her loose. - Miss Babbitt if you think of anything that can help us with this investigation, we'd appreciate it. - Miss Babbitt, I'm sorry I had to be so hard on you. I was trying to find the men who killed your son. Listen uhm, one of my officers will escort you home okay. - Thank you. - And again Miss Babbitt, if you can think of anything, it will be a great help in finding your son's killer. - Sorry about your son. - May vengeance be taken by the blood of the first child. May the dead be risen to judge his oppressor. And to those who would harm me, may they be taken away. Bring him who punishes to the light. - Shit. [laughter] Asshole. - Hey, I'm single, what about you? - Just finish prepping your damn area so we can get out of here. - Fine. I say we cut it short. This thing's already tagged. Let the next shift deal with it. - I agree. Besides, I have a date with Michelle. - Oh, you mean, long hair, tight ass, I wanna fuck her so bad, Michelle? - That'd be the one. - Lucky you man. - No, lucky her. I have a fifth of vodka and a 100 milligram Viagra. Tonight is gonna be the night of her life. - I can't believe you bagged Michelle. - Well you better believe it my friend. And in a couple hours, I'm gonna be knee deep in ass and tities, while you're at home touching yourself you frigin' perv. - Let's just get out of here. Hey does Michelle have any fat sisters? - Nah. She's got a brother. Fresh out of prison you damnn looser. - Whatever works. Is he fat too? [spooky music] [zip sounds] - We all know there must be swift retribution for what happened. Anyone and I repeat anyone involved must be held accountable for his death. - Mr. Lione I promise you, I will personally cut out the heart of every member of that fucking Twelve Block gang and I will hand deliver them to you on a plate. - And so we're clear. The Skulls were to be the protection of Mr. Calvetti and as we know that did not happen. - But Mr. Lione-- - Bitch, shut the fuck up. - Look, we've always done good business but we both know there's no room for mistakes especially the kind that cost me my best earner. - Mr. Lione just give me a minute let me just explain. - No no no no, you may not take anything. The only thing I want you to take is a few seconds to fix this situation. I mean come on, I always thought the Skulls were a formidable crew. Not a bunch of mamma looka idiots. - Look sir, those are my guys out in the street every fucking day keeping shit in line for you guys. Now look I understand what kind of power you hold. But make no mistake, I've got killers on my payroll too. But you knew that already didn't ya? - I think you and your crew are forgetting the chain of command here. I'd watch that silver tongue of yours if I were you, before you find it missing. - Consider my tongue watched. And like I said, we'll handle it. - I'm sure you will. Now see yourselves out. - Let's go. - Make plans to be here in the city within the next few hours. I'll send the information via our usual manner in the next 10. A driver will be at your door in 15 minutes, be ready. - So we go to war with the Skulls and the mob. Shit that ain't no fair to me. Hell, Leonidas and the Spartans almost came out on top with just 300 soldiers. And they was up against millions. - We gotta be smart about this. look, I'm down for whatever gon' take the Twelve to the next level man. And if warring with the mob gon' do it then I'm all in. But we gotta have a plan bro. We can't just go jumping off up into this shit half cocked. Cause if we do, we ain't gon' make it out bro. - Alright, you right. So what we do is, we get the soldiers together. Arm em up, post em up throughout the hood and it's kill on sight. A Skull show his head, shoot. Shit if the mob wants some, they can get it too. Men we can't afford to be out here looking weak, trying to talk it out. We gotta stand up right now to claim what's ours. - Yeah that's what I'm talking about my nigga. But first things first though, we gotta take care of that bitch. She can link us to the killings. - You're right. - Word. â™ª What you gon' do â™ª What you gon' do â™ª Come on, come on, come on, come on â™ª What you all gon' do â™ª What you all gon' do â™ª What you all gon' do â™ª tell me what you all gon' do â™ª What you all gon' do â™ª What you all gon' do â™ª What you all gon' do â™ª tell me what you gon' do [spooky music] - [Hop] Still no word from Rico? - No dawg. I'mma hit him up man, see if this shit done. - Damn I should have went with that nigga. - Relax y'all. We don't even know if it's a problem. - Dawg, Rico going in and do his business, won't take him more than a few minutes to do this job man. He definitely would have texted me by now. - Look, you and Pretty roll past there and see what's going on. - Alright bet. - Come on Hop, send Greasy with me. Shit, send your little sist for that matter. Anybody but this fashion matter motherfucker. What if he gotta run up out of there? Won't get 10 feet with his nigga to down tap shoes. - yo man fuck you alright. Just make sure you keep up with your scrawny ass. - Oh I will. Just leave your makeup in the car when we get there, P Diddy looking mother fucker. - That's enough both of y'all. Both of y'all niggas run past there and see what the fuck's going on. Greasy you're staying on this jack. Something ain't right. - This the house? - Yep. - Let's work. - Hey yo Circus, I just followed Freddy and Pretty over to this house on the West side. Those motherfuckers think they want to cross us, we're gon' take em out, call you when I'm done. - Yo, I'm going in quiet. - You can go in with that shaving kit if you want to. I got me a motherfucking gun. - Well just watch the fucking door. Rico Rico Ishmel... Na'll man it can't be Man we watched you die man. I watched you die. [phone rings] [phone rings] - God dammit. - If I didn't know any better I'd swear you and Tommy was butt buddies. - Shut the fuck up, you fucking skank. Tommy, talk to me is it done? - Yeah, but. - But what? Tommy. - I got Freddy G. In the backyard. And then when I went inside, Pretty was already dead. - Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean he was already dead? - I mean he took a knife to the fucking stomach. - [Circus] Who did it? Did you see who did it? Tommy. - Yeah. - [Circus] Who the fuck took him out. - [Tommy] It was Ishmel. - Uhhh, come again. - [Tommy] Ishmel killed the guy. - Bullshit, Tommy that's fucking bullshit. Ishmel's fucking warm food. Look I watched the guy take bullets to the chest, he's not gonna live through that, let alone come back and kill somebody. - I know Circus but I'm telling you it was him, I looked him dead in the eyes. - Now he's saying he saw fucking Ishmel. - There's no way, you seen what I did to him. - [Tommy] I'm telling ya Circus, it was him. - Alright look, meet me at the bar first thing in the morning. What the fuck. [Police radio chatter] - Hey Miles. What do you got? - We got a triple. Vic number one is Edward Johnson, street name, Pretty. It seems he took a big knife to the stomach. - Same pretty from Twelve block? - [Miles] Exactly. - What of the other two, where they at? - The other one's in the back room, he was stuffed in a closet. One Rico Caine, and who do you think he runs with? - Let me guess, Twelve Block - Bingo. Number three is Frederick Gaines, A.K.A Freddy G. He got it at the back door. All three were top brass for Twelve Block. - And who found em? - Get this, the home owner comes home, she finds the bodies in the house, she calls 911, guess what her name is? - [Lance] Who? - Old friend of you two. Ayida Babet. Well, that's all I've got for now, you two can take it from here. - Alright, good job Miles, thanks. - [Miles] I'm good. - So first her son gets found murdered with Mr. Mafia himself and just a few days later, three bangers get offed at her house? What's the connection? - Revenge maybe. - Maybe. Doesn't make any sense though I mean, you got this made guy, three hard core bangers and then this Hiatian immigrant kid. Tell you what I'd be willing to be the Skulls were involved in this somehow too. - How so? - Well, we know they do all the real dirty work for the mob right? And they been at it with Twelve Block for years. I'll be shocked if they're not involved. - You know what, and that could be it. Twelve Block murders Calvetti so now, somebody's hunting them down but, where does this kid fit into all of this? - That's a good question. Hey do me a favor. - Yeah. - Give Jonsi a call down at the county morgue. See if he can send me over a copy of the autopsy and notes on the Babet kid, I want to take a look at those. - On it. - Thanks. Hey what's up? - This case is getting crazier by the minute. - What do you mean? - I just got off the phone with Bill from County and he says that our body took a walk a couple of nights ago. - What do you mean took a walk? - I mean Ishmel Babbitt's corpse is missing. - Check this out. Symbols and these half burned candles. You make anything out of that? - I mean I know that Voodoo spells can protect people or harm them. - What about, bringing people back from the dead? People believe in that kind of stuff too don't they? - You're kidding right? - I'm just saying. [electronic music] â™ª I wear the face of disbelief â™ª I've been tempted to proceed â™ª And got away from my beliefs â™ª To succeed - So we keep things going right? - drop that price and we'll keep things going. Otherwise I might have to take my club's business somewhere else. - Come on DJ, don't be a fucking idiot. Who else is gonna give you the quality that we do huh? You can't trust the Pirates, you can't trust those Cowboys from the West End. We got a good thing going here bro. - Well I'm not interested in a good thing. Only a good price. And the ticket you're giving me right now, it is way too high. - Too high? We're already a thousand dollars under anybody else. Let's not even mention the quality. - Like I said, drop that ticket, and we can keep doing business. Otherwise, the Hell Riders no longer work with the Skulls. - Look, I know it sounds crazy but I'm telling you, it was Ishmel, I looked him dead in the eyes. - Tommy it was dark-- - No, it was him, I'm sure of it. - Or maybe it's from all the freaking pills you've been popping Tommy. - Fuck you. - You know fuck you. You want us to believe that some dead kid is walking around. Bull shit. You need to leave the fucking dope alone. - Look, I've been hearing things lately. - Oh now you're hearing shit too. - No, I don't mean like that. - Look. - I've been hearing in the streets that this kid's mom is into some serious wicked Voodoo shit. - Unfucking-Believable. Do you even hear yourself Tommy? You need to get your shit together, you're starting to scare me over here. - Right. That bitch can boil chickens and old bones all she wants. He ain't coming back. - Look dude you need to relax. Everything's gonna be fine. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. I think there's been an explanation for everything. I think maybe you're tired. I think these last few days have been rough on you. I think you need to get some rest. - Or maybe you need to lay off all the fucking oxi. - Hey. - Fucking serious. - Look, go home, get some rest. Cassie's right, lay off dope for a while, get your mind right. - [Tommy] Alright, I'll do that. - Good. [electronic music] - Mr. Mayor. - Listen eh, the reason why I asked you two to meet me down here, is because I think I got somebody in my office that is leaking information to the Lione family. - Sir. - I know I mean somebody is a leak in there. I mean they're giving him information. But I trust you two. -I mean you two are hardworking cops that are loyal to the badge I just, I just wish I could say that about every body. - [Stagnelli] Thank you sir. - So what do you got? - Well so far what we do know is that the Skulls and Twelve Block are locked up in some kind of a turf war again. And as we've known for quite some time, the mob is backing the Skulls and Carmine Lione's calling all the shots. - You got anything at all that we can hold Lione on for murder? - Not yet sir. - Slippery bastard. Alright, okay, look, keep working the streets alright. And you find out anything, you find out anything at all, you bring it right back to me, you understand. - Yes sir. - Right back to me. Alright, okay, you keep me posted. - Yes sir. Thank you sir. - What the hell? - Calm down, I'm not here to hurt you. - You know better than this, we can't be seen together. - Put your skirt down you freaking sissy. What do you got? - I got nothing, except off course what's general knowledge. Look, man you gotta stop with the bodies. - Yeah, I'm cleaning all that up now. Once I get it all done, we'll proceed with the distribution setup. - Look, the feds, I think they're onto me. And things, things are getting complicated. - Yeah they are. But you just gotta un-complicate em. Get your fucking people lined up. - So what are we thinking, maybe one of these guys swiped the body from County? - But why? - I don't know. Maybe set some kind of example or, who knows maybe they're trying to hide evidence of some sort. - Hey chief. - Hey chief. - So, we got two dead gang bangers. A mob hit, and now you're telling me we have a missing corpes. Some body better tell me something good - Chief it's looking like some type of turf war between Twelve Block, the Skulls and Lione Mob. - You mean somebody's tryna make a power play. - Look like Twelve Block is trying to make the move for the Downtown section. - That's no man's land it don't make sense. - There's a lot of unclaimed money down there though. - The mob and the Skulls are already connected. So that mean Twelve Block, if they can shake things up, they can make a real play for the throne. - Exactly. - Any ideas? - Well, I figured Stag and I can put a tail on their leader for a few days and then we'll setup outside the gangs' hangout, see who's coming and going. - If your lucky, you might catch Ishmel crip walking, if you're lucky. - We just might. - Listen, go get it. - Alright, thank you chief. - Alright, thank you. - You told chief about your back from the dead Voodoo theory? - I'm telling you Stag, some people really do believe that Voodoo can bring back the dead. - Then maybe they can bring back Tupac. - Tupac? What about Biggy? - So what you thinking bruh? - I ain't thinking shit dawg. You say we ride, then we ride. But we got to do something fast Hop. Three of our tops are just gone in just a couple of days man. Word spread through the hood, we might loose grip. - We ain't loosing shit. Now we arm these streets block by block. Hell if anybody know that is you. - I'm with you Hop I'm just saying man, our strength was in our top tier man. Three of em dead, chain broke, the shit might get ugly. - It's times like this that tell if a man even got the juice to be running the crew. Believe me niggas gon' pay for this. I'm personally gonna put Circus on the ground. Tool up nigga, let's ride. - Let's ride. - So uhm, I decided I'm gonna do it this weekend Stag. - Do what? - I'm gonna ask Linda to marry me. - Wow, congratulations, that's awesome. And it's about time. - What do you mean it's about time, it's only been what, not even eight years. - Eight years, that's six years too long. - Maybe. What happened last time around I didn't want to go there yet with her. - That's bullshit. - That's not bullshit. - Yeah. - Wait hold on. Looks like the boss and his boy are on the move. Wait hold on a second. It looks like they locked the place up. What do you say we give it a few minutes. Go in and have a look around. - The club? - Yeah,we go in there we get a lead inside of five minutes right. - It's gon' take at least a couple of hours for us to get a search warrant. Besides, we don't have a probable cause. - I'm talking more off the books here. You know what I mean, just a quick sneak in a peak. - You know this could cost both of us our jobs. - Nah that's not gonna happen Stag. Come on, we go in, we're out of there in five minutes alright. - Alright. Five minutes. Five minutes and we're out of there. - I promise you. Let's go. - Let's go. - Stag, over here. - What are we looking for anyway? - We'll know when we find it. Stag, take a look at this. Look at this. - These are just addresses. - Yeah but we know this first one belongs to Ishmel and his mother right. - Hmm hm. - We could belong that the second one belongs somebody who's in a shit load of trouble when these boys catch up to him. - I smell a hit. - Exactly. Let's go. [spooky music] - Hey yo Circus, it's Tommy. I just got back to your house so, I just want to see you whenever you get back here. Alright. - Ahhhhhhh [scream] [engine sounds] - Jesus fucking Christ. - Oh my God. - Oh my God, oh my God, what happened? - How the fuck do you think I'm supposed to know. He fucking got a axe sticking out his fucking side. Alright look, shut the fuck up for a minute, let me think here for a second, let me think. - Men I can't believe the rap sheet on some of these guys. I thought we've put half of these people away already. - Definitely ain't no boy scouts. - What the hell. I swear I just saw Ishmel Babet walking the driveway of that house. - What? - I just saw Ishmel Babet alive. Stag it was him. Alright, clear as day it was him. - If he did come back to exact some Voodoo revenge, then why are they still alive? - Who says they are? Let's get up there. [door sounds] - What do you two pigs want? - Just relax. We just want to ask you a couple quick questions. - What? I'm pretty busy right now, so you know. - You mind if we come in? Alright look, you guys see anything around here today, anything strange at all? - Strange like what? - Like, anything, like maybe something that has to do with this beef that's going on between Twelve Block and the Skulls? - What beef are you talking about? Look unless you guys got a warrant, I'm done answering questions. [cassie screams] Hey, hey, calm the fuck down. Go get the car and bring it out back right now.

I'll go get the car. - Wait wait wait wait, no wait, wait wait wait don't. - Fuck. Shit. Fuck. [phone rings] - Yes. - Mr. Lione. - I've been awaiting your call, good news I hope. - No, not quite but I could really use your help. - I'm listening. - Look, I'm taking a real beating over here. My whole fucking crew is dead. Cassie is dead, Tommy is dead and someone left a fucking dead banger from Twelve Block out in front of my fucking house. Look, I'm gonna go dump the bodies. But we have got to get this shit handled now. Otherwise we both might end up working for some spook called Muhammed or some shit, you know. - I promise you I will never be employed by anyone named Muhammed, nor will you cave in to the pressure caused by some rag tag group of thugs. We hired you because we were assured you were good at what you do. And now you're cowering at the corner because a few of your soldiers have been killed. I'll handle it from here. Your contract is cancelled. Good day. - Fuck. - Shit. Fuck that. Fuck, they got all my niggas, all my niggas - [Big Mike] This Big Mike, I'm busy right now. - Damn it. [spooky music] [door sounds] - [Chief] Come in. - [Lance] Hey chief. - [Chief] how are you doing? - [Lance] Good. Take a look at that. - [Chief] What's this? - That's a case file. - I know what it is. What's in it? - Mr. Rodney Hopper was bludgened to death in a social club owned by he and a few of his associates. - Who is Rodney Hopper? - That's Hip Hop chief. - [Chief] No way. - Yes way, trust me it gets better. You know that house that Stagnelli and I staked out yesterday, Circus' house. This morning a neighbor was knocking at the door, she's knocking, knocking and there's no answer. She was marching on in, there's blood everywhere all in the inside of his house. - Where's Circus, can you find Circus? - There is no sign of him. But there is one more thing. About an hour ago, a patrol cop spotted a car parked down by the dumps down there, goes in for a closer look. Three bodies in side. Two of them are Skulls and the other was this Twelve Block banger they called Greasy. - What's your take? - I'm not sure yet chief. I mean it's definitely crew on crew. But I gotta think the mobs are retaliating for the Calvetti hit too. - Yeah I agree. I'll tell you what you find Circus. He's either the suspect, or your next victim. - [Lance] My thoughts exactly chief. - There you go. Let's go to work. - [Lance] Alright thanks chief. - Cool, keep me posted. - I will. [upbeat music] Alright keep your eyes open Stag. We gotta find this guy now. - Well at least we know he's behind all this. - Maybe he is. Not by himself though. The other guys in his crew or the mob, there's something else going on here too, I don't know what the hell it is. [phone rings] Corbin. Yeah. What the fuck, when? Jesus. Alright, yeah, we'll get over there. - What's going on? - They found Constanzo dead. - [Stag] What? - Mayor Constanzo is dead, they found him in his car, somebody shot him in the fucking head. We gotta go. - But if we leave now, we won't get another chance to get Circus. - Shit. That's our boy right there. Shit. - What you want to do? - We gotta take him Stag. You know what, it's almost dark, let's wait till then and we'll go inside alright. - Alright. [gun fires] - [Circus] Stay back. - Drop the weapon. - Stay back. Stay the fuck back. - Put the weapon down Circus. [gun fires] Ishmel! [gun fires] - The city of Cleveland is still recovering after two of its own were buried today after being found murdered only hours apart. Mayor Peter Constanzo and Detective Lance Cobin were both found murdered in separate incidents, each believed to be linked to the city's ongoing gang war. Police are saying they will use the full weight of the law to find those responsible and bring them to justice. â™ª Why did you have to go â™ª Go away from me â™ª And it feels like a nightmare and not reality â™ª Yeah â™ª And you told me you would never leave me â™ª Never leave my side â™ª And now you're gone â™ª Yeah â™ª Can you tell me why you're gone from me â™ª Can you tell me why you're gone from me â™ª Gone from me â™ª We had so many years â™ª Now there's so many tears â™ª And now I'm just living my worst fears â™ª Can you tell me why you're gone from me â™ª Tell me - [Miles] Hey Stag, how are you doing? - I'm okay, what you got for me? - I was just down at forensics. The sample we took from the door of the crime scene came back inconclusive. But, they did get a hit on a latent we pulled from the door knob. Came back to a Tamar Babbitt. They had him for a mob murder a few years ago, but couldn't stick it. He fled back to his native country. - And let me guess, Haiti. - Yeah, how'd you know? [door sounds] - Detective Stagnelli how can I help you? - When is the last time you seen Tamar? - Me don't know what you're saying, bull shit. - Is he here now? - No. - I know all about Tamar and the mafia here in this city. I know your son's a contract killer. - Me don't know what you're talking about. - You don't care that your son is responsible for over a dozen murders. - I haven't seen Tamar since me and Ishmel left Haiti. I have no knowledge of what he does here or over there. - I ran his name against airport customs and they have no record of him entering this country. I enter Ishmel's and I got a hit. Looks like he entered several days ago, but Ishmel's dead. - What do you want from me? - I'll ask you again, when is the last time you seen your son? Get down. Get on the ground now. - I know this had been difficult considering your recent family matters. But as usual you've delivered. The family won't forget this. As agreed, 15k per head. All you need to do now is handle Circus, and we're finished here. Tamar, after you're finished with Circus, my driver can have you on a plane and back in Haiti in less than four hours. - I will take care of Circus, then I have to go see my mother. - You have been a loyal business partner to this family. Now take care of your own. But be careful, everything is hot right now. The bodies have piled up and the police need an arrest. - I will take care of Circus. - Don't worry, he's on our side. - You made a hell of a mess in my town kid. It will take me years to clean this up. I think you ought to get out of town until things cool off. - Yeah Tamar go home and lay low for a while. - I'm going to call the airport. I want you to get out there, get on a plane and get out of town. - Uh yeah, this is the mayor. Look, I just had a credible threat on my life. I want you to draw all the police from the airport and get into my office immediately to protect me, my staff and my family. Now! Fuckin' psycho. - That kid is as loyal to me as any Italian in little Italy. I trust him with my life. - That kid is a fucking animal. And I don't trust him at all. And you know what, I don't trust you much either. I mean can't you do business at all without killing everybody. - I'll call you when everything's done. - Whatever Yeah this is the mayor, listen, I want a SWAT team sent to the airport immediately. I want you to pick up a suspect by the name of Tamar Babet. He is armed and he is dangerous. He's black male, he's about six two, wearing all black clothing. Asshole. [gun fires] - Mr. Lione, your friend is dead. I feared that he would betray us and my instincts were right. There's nothing I can do, it had to be done. Now look, I'm going to go take care of Circus and then I have to go see my mother. Once I am done, I need to disappear. I can't go back to prison. - I don't wanna have to shoot you. - I'm sorry mamma. [gun fires] - I think I always knew he would follow us here. - Hey. You take care of yourself over there. Don't sleep, alright, I've been over there. It can be a real cut throat. - It can't be any worse than what it is over here. - Go into the car, let me talk to mamma. Hey... I love you Momma - No need Tamar, no need. That boy there, he deserves a chance. A chance I tried to give you both. But the right ways was never your ways. You don't think I heard the rumors of you killing people for monies? And this mafia business in the U.S. The police here, every other day, I have to give him a chance. A chance you never wanted. I am so sorry for the pain and destruction he has caused. - It's not your fault. It's not your fault Miss Babet. - [Ishmel] Mamma, I've come home. â™ª [rap music]
