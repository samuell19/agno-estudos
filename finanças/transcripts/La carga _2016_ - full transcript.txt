New Spain. XVI century. Francisco Tenamaztle, a great Caxcan leader and warrior... ...leads an indigenous uprising in defense of the rights of his people. Until his recent arrest, Tenamaztle had led battles... ...over a 9 year period against the Spanish troops. A group of Franciscan priests are mobilizing to secure his release. The Viceroy´s envoy will have to answer... ...for this unexpected change. Don’t worry Tenamaztle. Open the doors! Allow the Viceroy´s envoy to enter. Open the doors! Come on keep going! Open the doors! Use your proximity with Francisco Tenamaztle... ...to convince him to talk to his people so they leave immediately. The only way to avoid a revolt is to follow justice. What side are you on... the side of the Indians? Or the Spanish crown? On the side of justice, divine and earthly justice... ...and all those Indians waiting outside... ...will either leave or not, depending on the verdict of the hearing. I have an urgent delivery. Put the load on me. Have a good trip. The envelope needs to arrive at the main plaza at dusk. If only father could see you! Father is dead Itzmin. Mother is alive... ...and you don’t even come to see her during celebrations. I don’t want to see any bastards. You're talking about my son! Ollin! Father! Am I fast. Speed is not what is most important. Endurance is. Now go and play Ollin. Itzmin looks like a rabid dog. His pain has to end sometime, Painalli. Otherwise it will kill him. I need to rest, mother. The envelope needs to arrive at the main plaza at dusk. A rider will be waiting for it. - Take her things to the lady. - Yes sir. - Thank's for risking yourself, Son. - Don’t worry Mother It's not even two thirds of what they brought last trimester... ...and the quality is decreasing, Don Miguel. God knows the investment I have put into those mines... ...and I will not allow someone to steal from me, Luis. Tell the foreman... ...that tomorrow I am going up to the mines... ...and I expect a full report. Sir... they are going to hold a hearing to decide the future of Francisco Tenamaztle. What? There is a rumor that they are going to extradite him to Spain. To Spain? We can´t let that happen. There are more than three thousand Indians outside the prison. They fear for a rebellion. We leave tomorrow at daybreak for the city. Alright? Go on, Diaz. I need going to the city to meet Fray Valerio. It is very dangerous my girl. Nothing is going to stop me Maria. It’s a fact, my father must be present at the hearing. I’ll go. Mrs. Elisa... I took the liberty of buying you some colorful clothing... ...that I believe will suit you better. Thank you, now if you will excuse me I have things to do. Fray Valerio, thanks to you, I have in my hands the evidence... ...showing my father's responsibility in the murder of my husband Diego. I will make him pay, even if it’s the last thing I do in this life. I declare it is my wish to testify in favor of Francisco Tenamaztle... ...and join the quest for equality and justice that you and my husband started. I appreciate all your help and I pray that our efforts pay off. Sincerely, Elisa de Ibarra. Ollin... ...where is your father? But what are you doing? Don’t you understand that this could cost you your life? Do you want to leave Ollin and your mother? I believe in this cause. If someone has a problem with it that is not my concern. I haven’t come here to talk about religion. I need you to come with me to the city. I have an important load for you. Why didn’t you ask Itzmin as usual? This time it is not a delivery of armaments to the Spanish. I need someone responsible and trustworthy. Look around. We are only a few men left in town, all of them need it. This is about saving Francisco Tenemaztle. It is a just cause, a cause your father died for. If your father lived, without a doubt, he would come with me. Father believed in this cause... ...you wouldn’t need this. Take Coyolli with you. I’ll see you tonight. This damn gout is going to kill me! Have you thought about your future daughter? I don’t want you to stay here taking care of an old man like me. Don’t worry... I believe you are aware of Diaz’s feelings for you? He is not of noble lineage but... at least he is a nobleman. Ok, stop, stop... ...I have to rest... ...tomorrow I have to leave very early to the city. These coins are for your son. Ollin! Are you taking him? Each load has it's specific needs, Itzmin. This matter doesn’t concern you So be it then. You are weak... ...so weak Painalli. Wait!... ...I have decided to go with you. And may I ask why? I’m going to follow your advice father... ...and think about my future. Very good! Then let's go daughter, let's go! Let’s go! - You may leave. - But sir… Leave now! I was so stupid... to put you in front of your people on the Mixton hill. I should killed you when I captured you. I've seen your family outside, destroyed. Is that what you wanted? What we want is more than being your slaves on our own  Nochistlan land. Do you really think that all this will end in your favor at the Indias council? Here or there you will be hung by your neck. And how will you end? You, or me... ...until your death... or mine! We will see. Francisco Tenamaztle is nothing more than a Spanish murderer and as that, he should be judged here. Silence, order! ...not in Spain. If Francisco Tenamaztle stays here, it will likely cause a rebellion. Order, Silence, silence! We all know about the abuses of authority committed by government. In some cases the accused defended himself as best he could... ...and in other cases they blamed him for crimes he is not responsible for. Are you accusing me of false testimonies? Do you have proof of the prisoners innocence... ...in the crimes that according to you are false? There is a witness. You are not talking about another indian? If Mr. Miguel will allow me to finish. There is a Spanish witness, of noble lineage... willing to declare in front of the King that the insurgency of Tenamaztle was in self-defense. The most noble gentlemen are here in this room Could you tell us who your illustrious witness is? He is not in this room. And we have to take precautionary measures to keep hidden his identity. But we have the evidence... that we will present when the time is right. What guarantee can you offer us that this witness and evidence really exist? The word of a Franciscan monk kissing this holy cross. If Friar Antonio hasn’t blasphemed in the face of God... ...then this hearing is in the hands of the Indias Council in Spain. Go to the Inn and keep an eye on Elisa until I arrive. Hurry up! I want a private meeting with the Viceroy. This exceeds our friendship Miguel. This is about a rebellion. Aren’t you going to let me see the Viceroy? Stop thinking only about yourself Miguel. This is much bigger. Come in! Where are the documents? - Where are them? - Mr. Miguel... Mr. Miguel, Mr. Miguel…. ...they saw her entering the Santa Clara convent. How could I have been so stupid? She is the witness... ...she is being used by Friar Valerio. Her testimony at the Indias Council... is going to destroy me. If you bring me Elisa to the Hacienda... ...half of the reward is yours. And my daughter too. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go! We have to go now! - What's happening? - Let's go please. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go! We are looking for Mrs Elisa de Ibarra. We know she is here. This is a closed convent. You can’t enter. Two of you look over there! I know what you are looking for. I can give it to you. Where did they go? Espinosa... ...give him two coins. If we find them we will give you five more. Have faith Francisco. The King will have to listen to you. And even if it were so… They will cover you with a black cloak... ...just until we are safely out of the city. I have told you, my people won’t resist. I really appreciate it, but no. No! She doesn’t want it Coyolli... ...and it is better if she doesn’t eat. That way she will weigh less. Do you think she will be more comfortable in front with me? I don’t know. Ask her yourself. Would you like to travel looking down at the... ...ground or looking up at the beautiful clouds? I don’t understand a word you´re saying. It’s better to look up at the beautiful clouds... ...than down at the ground, don’t you think? Don´t these indians understand that I don’t speak their language? They made that path so your beasts can’t pass through. Why don’t you let me walk? It would be easier for you and I wouldn´t feel so ridiculous. A Tameme is guiding them. We will go around the mountain and go down the other side. It’s better if we go through the mountains without going down until necessary. The mountains are very dangerous, it's not a safe path. We need to find another way. - They are getting close! - Coyolli, I’m not risking the load. The load! We are all in danger! We are going the way I say we are going. Wait, wait! If you keep going with me they are going to reach us soon. Swear to me that you will get her there safe and sound. You should go with them until the coast, we will meet there. - No Friar Valerio I can’t. - You are safe with them. - Please, Don’t leave me. - Trust me, trust me. - Now, go! - Friar Valerio There is no time to lose. I’m going to reason with Diaz Do you actually think you are going to block our path? Did you see who is guiding them? I beg you to leave her be! You have put her life in danger because of your damn intrigue Remember I was your confessor Then my secrets will die with you. Who is the Spaniard who killed Friar Valerio? You speak my language Who is he? My father’s henchman... who will do anything to prevent me from arriving to the coast Everything under control Hurry up. Let´s move! Faster. First Friar Valerio, now Coyolli. Why is that woman worth so much? That doesn’t concern you. After we pay you I don’t want to see you again. Well pay me then. I did my part. Not before you get us out of this hell. What can I do for you so you can show me a little affection? Free me, if you really care about me. God knows what I feel for you... ...but I have to obey Mr. Miguel He doesn’t care about you any more than he does about his indian slaves. Killing is the thing you know how to do best. Isn’t that true? Have you lost your mind? If you don’t fix that foolish attitude... ...you will be looked in a convent for the rest of your life. I’d prefer that then. You stupid. Where are the documents? Let go of me. I don’t have anything. Let go of me please. You’re hurting me. You’re hurting me! Tie her up. I should kill you right here. If you think that I betrayed you... ...we are even. But to me… ...you are dead. Which of you sons of bitches was on guard last night? Hey! Here is the guide! It was the indian that escaped? You are going to tell me who he is and why he left a dog like you alive? I can’t, I can’t take it anymore! I’m sorry about your friend´s death. His name was Coyolli. You hate the Spaniards right? We are not all the same. From a large tree like this one... ...my brother and I saw how the Spaniards killed our father. - Keep going! - I can’t. They stopped here. He is carrying her. How far ahead are they? Half a day. Let’s go! I don’t think I can make it to the coast. Get down please! Aren’t you going to wash up? How dare you? Sweat stinks. It doesn't matter how noble you are. His footprints are lighter again. Is she walking with him? No... ...but he is not carrying her. They have separated. No, that is impossible. She would be incapable of going alone. She stayed behind. Eat... ...it will help you. Were you baptized? I resisted Friar Valerio. Without faith I wouldn´t have the strength to live. This... is what gives me strength. You shouldn’t rejoice in your ignorance. Ignorance is not knowing that eating lots... ...of that fruit is going to give you diarrhea. Now, what's happening? They deviated. They are not going to the sea. It can’t be. They need to board a ship on the coast. Stop! Where are they going? Where are they going? Where is Coyolli? Why didn’t he come with you? Who is she? She is a load. Why did you bring her here? She believes in my father’s and Tenamaztle’s fight for justice. Shhh…. Calm down son. I’m here with you. Where is there water? Water? They are close. I will escape alone. You should stay with your son. - Listen to me! - No, I owe it to my father. What is happening Painalli? Itzmin is guiding them to me. What is the purpose of all this? Mother, where is Painalli? How far will your vengeful feelings for painilli take you? Get out of here! Don’t make things harder. They are not here anymore. Let’s go! It will rain... ...and it will make it harder for them to catch up to us. We will arrive in two days. I prefer going on my own foot. I don’t want you carrying me as if you were a beast. I’m a Tameme. I’m not ashamed of it. Even so I don’t want to do it. - Stubborn woman!- You can say what you want. I won’t change my opinion. Can we take a break? Can I see them? Thank you! I didn’t saw the mother of your son, Ollin. She died when Ollin was born. I’m sorry. She wasn’t from my town. My brother brought her. It almost doesn’t hurt anymore. Diego gave it to me, my husband... ...the day we got engaged. It is engraved with the same gold that ended up taking his life. It was in the desert on the path from San Luis Masquitique. I know those places. It was Diaz who was in charge of the expedition that my husband commanded. That Spaniard seems willing to do anything for you. I know... ...and I´m sorry for all the harm that he has caused. He’s not the only one. My brother... ...is the one that is guiding them. The same one that…? He never got over that she chose me. I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Look! We only want her. Nothing else. If you let the lady come with us nothing will happen to you. And your son either. I give you my word as a gentleman. Accept! Please... Tie her up and guard her well! Not here. Let it be here. Here I am. Kill me! Kill me. kill me. Come on, kill me! Here I am. Kill me! Kill me! He was already dead when... ...when I threw him, in the river. Pablo, accompany the lady. Now you hate me, but with time, you will realize that everything I do is for your own good. Even kill? Stop torturing yourself with the past daughter... ...and don’t insist on holding on to false and unfounded accusations. I know what I know. I'm not afraid to shut it up anymore. - Don’t threaten me! - Or what? Are you going to kill me like you did with Diego? It is going to take time to repair. Yes, but when are we going to be able to leave this hell? Not before tomorrow... It is dangerous to travel at night and I’m worried about the Indians. What indians? Huachichiles. They tried to steal our horses on the last expedition. I trust that you know how to get us out of here. You are the only one who knows the route. I put my life on it. I hope that isn’t necesary. And you Elisa... have you’ve heard what to expect out there with those Indians. Come. Come... ...Look! No one drink anymore water... ...and find those Indians. There is no option other than to continue on foot. This place is not safe… Diaz! Come back! Are you okay? Chew. Chew... Get on! I admire your courage indian! I have always loved you Elisa. Everything I did, was for you. Everything. I don’t know how to thank you for everything that you have done for me. You have lost too much during this journey... - ...and I’m responsible. - No... ...that was my destiny. Lady! Come with me! Over there I wouldn’t be anything. And here? Here I’m a Tameme... ...and a free man. I attest to that... ...and I will fight so no one can change that. Lady! Friar Bartolome de las Casas. It´s an honor. This way please. Francisco Tenamaztle fought for the rights of indigenous native people... ...against the Spanish authority. He is known as the defender of human rights. The Spanish encomienda system (a type of slavery), which Tenamaztle... ...fought against, was abolished in 1718 in Mexico.
