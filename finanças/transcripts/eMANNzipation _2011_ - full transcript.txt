Thanks. So, you like it? Yes, sure. If you don't like my food then give it back - No I can make you muesli - No, it's alright, thanks again. Good morning, Dominik - Morning Sven. Well, I guess I'm gonna get ready. Hey Dominik, everything good? - Yeah, great. Well, that's nice Denise is not really in her best mood. Is this my... I mean, it s been awhile since I... No, this has nothing to do with you. This is so salty. How can you eat this? It's not that bad. You're right. This is uneatable. It's a salty disaster. A total horror for tongue and palate. Now be gone, you terrorist of taste. Oh, what joy. Well, the thing is... I... I mean we there is not much space... here... for the three of us. Do you... is it better... Do you want me to move out? I am not against you staying here. But Denise is? For her it's stressful. It was only meant for a few days. So? Would you prefer if I move out? Yeah. No... well... if it's up to me then No. This is unbelievable. I am not his maid. Rubber! Horst. HORST! Rubber does NOT go in the organic waste bin. Hey Sven, it's Dominik. There is no sign here. You are NOT organizing the kitchen well enough. Okay I will ask for Holger thanks again. Excuse me. Do you know where... Is this the... Is this 10 Altenburger Allee? So, here should be... You had problems with your wife, right? And now you don't know where to stay, do you? And you want to talk to Holger. Right? Yeah. No, no, I'm not Holger. I am Horst. Sounds similar, eh? But I'm very different from Holger. Holger is going to law school. That man in the yard, wanted to tell you that rubber does not go in the organic bin. Yeah, that's Gregor, he is very particular. You can't take him too seriously. What happened to your eye? I had some bad luck there. Nice, eh? Well, it's okay. Here in this 'Shelter for Men' everyone has to do their part I often cook and I believe they all like my cooking Horst! Yes. Hello Gregor sends his regards. Well, isn't that nice. And he wants me to tell you, not to put plastic in the organic bin. Are you moving in? Uhm, I think... possibly I'm Lukas Dominik Liebmann. You should definitely talk to Holger, he just got in. Holger! You must have so many questions. Hello, I'm the Holger Gregor told me we got a newcomer. So nice you found your way here. And you are the...? The Dominik. Swell, I suggest we'll have a chat and a cup of tea in my office. Yeah, sure. By the way, Horst, we'll need to talk about the way you separate trash. But not now. There is this acquaintance, he's actually more a co-worker well, I am currently out of work but he owes me a good amount of money, that I could it's quite a bit of money decent sum of money. I thought I could use that to... I know, it's not easy for anyone to apply for social welfare. But it's something you really have to do. It would be only a few weeks that I... Our Shelter for Men is to help men in emotional and financial need. However while Women's Shelters constantly receive public grants aren't we supported at all with public payments. Abused men are still a taboo issue in our society. I wouldn't say that I was abused. I just had a lot. I had quite a lot of bad luck recently. I know. Can you assure me to apply for welfare this week? This is really important, okay? Yes, okay, if it is that important. Super, Dominik. Back to the issue of group therapy if you do not want to participate, then this would be okay. But it would be cool if you could check it out maybe just once with no obligations. Then you can still decide. Okay? What do you say? Could you for once in your life be punctual? Yes, sorry. Great! Great. Now we are complete. But before our new member will introduce himself we will do our breathing exercise. Okay, if you want to introduce yourself now. Hello, I am, uh... Dominik. Hello, 'Uh-Dominik' Hello. I have been... I am here because I have... So, last year I have had quite... If you prefer, someone else can go first. Yes, thank you. All right. Then who wants to go first? I am here because my wife abused me emotionally and when I was on my weakest she kicked me out. She dropped me like a hot potato. Like a hot potato. Thank you, Horst. I'm Lukas I was physically abused my wife. After the divorce I had my coming-out. But the abuse and beatings recurred when I was with Mike. Now I am learning to set boundaries and take responsibility. Great, Lukas I'm an alcoholic. My name is Andreas. Also, I am a banker. Gregor. Well, if it is imperatively necessary. Well. The meanest, cruelest cunt in the world lied to me, stole from me and manipulated me. And as if that wasn't enough perfidy she also got me institutionalized. Say. Have you heard of the novel 'A Victors Murder'? Of course. I wrote that. It was 19 weeks on the bestsellers list. Two weeks it was number one. None of the money is left. Not one cent. She stole all of it. And then this evil, rotten cunt...- Thank you, Gregor, that will do for now. And Dominik, what about now? Yeah, okay. I am Dominik I work for the Berlin Tech University in the math department. Well, not anymore. And I also had a very difficult time. I even say I had an unusual amount of bad luck. I lost my job and my apartment. And unfortunately my wife left me and took our son. You got a son? How old is he? Dylan is six now Dylan? What kind of name is that? It's even worse than Kevin or Marvin Dylan. My wife liked the name. It's someone's name on Beverly Hills 9010. It's 90210. I personally preferred the name Torben. Torben? Well I think it's great that you have a son. Children are just wonderful. Do you have children? Me? Oh no, for heaven's sake, NO! Oh, Horst come on! Okay, continue. Continue? That's it. And I don't know where to stay. Okay, Dominik. So that's all? What happened to your eye? I was in a bar and there was some sort of mix-up. A brawl? Yes, why? Come on people, don't you see that this guy is full of shit. Hold on, what do you mean, full of shit? As if you pansy have ever been in any fight. I don't understand. I thought... Oh, I had such bad luck, I lost my job and my house and my wife and my child. Oh, I lost everything. Such a bullshit. Don't try to bullshit me. Do you admit that you are full of shit? I don't think this is the right thing for me Dominik, wait. That guy was never ever in any fight Gregor, you are so over-intrusive, really. Hey, man - Hey. Gregor is really a jerk. You're doing the right thing. Fresh air helps to calm down the anger I'm not angry. No? No, not at all. But Gregor was such a... Why did you walk out then? I don't see any advantages in this group therapy. But just talking about yourself can be very liberating. That may be so for some people. But not for me. Okay. Come on, let's have a drink. Well, I am a little short on cash. No Problem. I got money. Come on. Well, come on! No, that's silly. It doesn't have to be a long sentence. Let's see, how about the sentence. 'I love you' Well that one is easy in Swedish Jag Ã„lskar Dig in Russian Ya Lyubyu Tebya Turkish Seni Seviorum in Hebrew Anee Ohev Otakh then Je t'aime and I love you. That's amazing you speak five languages six with german. Ah yes, lk hou van jou, but I don't speak Dutch very well I can only speak German. You are a genius. Not at all. I just learn languages easily. I grew up bilingually, German-Swedish. My mother was half Swedish. Yeah, my father was always half drunk. Cheers. Here's to better times. To the good times. Probably not that long ago. Six years it has been. I was on vacation in Northern Hessia. It is so beautiful there. You were on vacation by yourself? No, there were three of us. My friend Sven and his new girlfriend Denise. Both of them madly in love. Somehow Sven decided I had to get out and enjoy a vacation. Those two just couldn't keep their hand off each other. I had time to read and to enjoy some hiking on my own. Sounds to me you were the fifth wheel on the wagon. I guess I was. That's why Denise had the brilliant idea to set me up with someone. What about her? Denise, I know you mean well but... I think there is something about her. I will ask her. Man, this is not going to work. Sorry to bother you, but my boyfriend's buddy really likes you but he's extremely shy. Maybe you'd like to. Which one? The one with the basecap? No, the other one. If you like him maybe you could dance with him. What do you think? I don't know. Maybe later. Whatever you feel like. In my experience nothing comes of this except an awkward moment but suddenly she was there and pulled me to the dancefloor. While dancing she looked me directly in the eyes I tried to return the look but it's not easy to look into someone's eyes more than a few seconds. And yet she was so beautiful. And didn't you talk at all? No, we were just dancing. And suddenly she said: It's stuffy in here. I gotta get out of here. We strolled and talked. She was 20 and planned to do an apprenticeship. You really live in Berlin? She couldn't believe that I live in Berlin and thought that was so cool. Unbelievable that is so cool. Well, for some 20-year old cowtown girl Berlin is certainly the greatest. Yeah, Berlin is special like the number Pi by the way. What? And she had such a fresh and infectious laugh. You think so? Many say I laugh too loud. We kept on talking and it was incredibly romantic. And then you kissed, right? Well not really but kind of. Well, did you? She kissed me in a way. I haven't been kissed before. Never mind. The following days were truly amazing. You don't like thunderstorms? No, not really. Why not, thunderstorms are cool. I find thunderstorms annoying, loud and invasive. Invasive? Yes, and really rude. You're crazy. After a proper thunderstorm everything is so lucid and the air is clean. That may be so. Let's go for a swim. Here? Now? Sure. It will be great. No, I don't know. Come on. It'll be fun. We have no swimming gear with us. Domi, Domi. Come on, come on, come on! It's so nice and the water is so warm, come in. Just be spontaneous for once. Actually, I'm not really spontaneous I find it better to think matters over. Let's go. Don't act so shy. You know what? Let's do it at the window. Okay. This time was incredible. Best time of my life. It never lasts, believe me I know the time was gone so fast. Tomorrow already? Tomorrow. Will you miss me? More than I would like to. Berlin is far. Yeah. I'm sure it's nice there I've never been there. You could... Would you like to visit me sometimes? Then I can see how it is when you're there. Maybe you don't like me there. Are you different there? No, but then you see my apartment, and my chaos. Actually that's not true in fact I am very neat. Shortly after that she came to Berlin. And that was nice too but somehow it wasn't as good as the days in Northern Hessia. Again the time was over too quickly. At the bus station we hugged and she whispered in my ear I am pregnant. What, really? Let's get married, yes? Angela. Would you like to marry me? So much for never being spontaneous. Well generally. But you just spontaneously talked about yourself and that was all right, wasn't it? I wasn't on a vacation for years. So, my buddy Sven wanted to visit Hessia with his new flame. It's really nice there. And then there was this wonderful girl. She smiled at me and pulled me just like that to the dancefloor. Just like that? Just like that. Usually nothing come from it but suddenly there was this wonderful girl. She smiled at me and pulled me to the dancefloor without saying anything. Customer Service! Uh, so then we danced. YES! It's not easy to look someone in the eyes for more than a few seconds yet she was so beautiful to watch. So we were just dancing. And then she said... Why do I sort the spices alphabetically when Horst always messes them up again? Sorry, I thought. What? Okay Dominik, let's stay calm now I'll make us some tea I don't want any tea. Thank you though. According to the youth welfare office they brought Dylan in a children's home. You got this today? Yes. I'm still registered at Sven's place the letter got there awhile ago. The youth welfare office withdrew child custody from your wife and from you. Do you have alcohol or drug problems? No! I mean Angela is a merry person and and she likes to party, sometimes with alcohol as well. What should I do now? If you want custody back we have to file a petition. Okay. Let's do that. When I see Dylan I can tell him... I would refrain from visiting Dylan at least until the custody matter is resolved. And... likely they want interview you for a psychological opinion. Sure, let's do that. That's no big deal, right? Yeah, well. Would you reconsider coming to our group therapy? It doesn't have to be in a group maybe with a single therapist. I am not crazy. I didn't mean to imply that. My wife and I just separated. If everyone who got separated is a psycho then we would have more loony bins Germany than churches. Maybe so. Maybe it will be just good for you? But if you think this is nothing for you, then okay. But I feel you could make better use of your time. Sports or a Hobby? I already do have a hobby. I read gladly, and with much enthusiasm. Reading is great but it's not very sociable. Reading is great but too much reading can actually seclude oneself. Handball, football, martial arts or volleyball I really don't care for ballgames. I like to roam. To roam? That's hiking. Well, hiking by yourself is not very sociable either. It wouldn't have to be sports. How about a dance class? Angela always wanted to take a dance class. Yeah good. And could you maybe try this with an open mind? I don't know Dominik. It's important allowing things to happen, okay? Now, let's see that again. And please. Oh sorry. You are the man, so start leading. I am leading. You'd have to lead a bit stronger. You should lead gently but firmly. I'm sorry. Don't tense up. Stay relaxed. And stay with the rhythm. Don't pull so rough. Softly and gently. And stay with the rhythm. Now lead her into a turn with a gentle, grand, rotating movement. Oh sorry! You have to look where you are leading the lady to. I'm sorry but but dancing is really not my thing. Well, I think dancing is really not his thing. You know, maybe he is just simply too nervous. I'm not nervous. Listen! An interview for a psychological opinion is nothing to be scared of it's just a routine procedure. There is no reason to be nervous. I am really not nervous. Okay, I just thought that. If someone would do the interview being overly nervous then that would be a disadvantage. Yes, sure. What bothers me... The thing is this they are looking for any meaningless, trivial details which they interpret into anything. So, I have to watch out for even the smallest details. Mister Liebmann, you can come in now. Hello Mr. Liebman, my name is Witthoff. Have a seat. Where should I... sit down? Doesn't matter. Whereever you like. Please! I think. Where were we? This is Ms Fottener and to my right... Can I sit here as well? Would it be okay if I sit here? Yes it's alright, but please sit down now. So we can continue. Yeah good. Where were we? You were about to introduce Mr Bohr. Yes of course. Mr Bohr and Ms Fottener is transcribing. Well, Mr. Liebmann. You have applied to change the finding of the family court Berlin toward obtaining child custody of your son, Dylan Liebmann. Custody has been revoked from you and your spouse Angela. The child is currently held in the juvenile home at 17 Eschenstrasse. You hereby requisition child custody for your son Dylan. About the proceeding. We will ask a few questions. Mr Bohr is Psychologist and will begin. Mr. Liebmann, first of all it's nice that you are here today ls there maybe something you'd like to ask me? No? Then we'll just go ahead. Mr Liebmann you have... I... I would... uh... sitting... So, I would say... let's start, right? Hello. Can I help you with something? I wanted to enroll for the beginners karate class. Holger recommended that... Holger Schramm? Now I'm waiting for... whoever sits here I guess Mandy disappeared again. Then just join us. I got no sports gear with me. We got karate suits for guests. No problem. Shouldn't we ask the coach? No we don't, because I am the coach I'm RenÃ©, hi Dominik. â€“ Just come along Dominik! We're a mixed group. White, yellow and green belts. Hello Belinda. - Rene. Hello! Here are the locker rooms. I get your suit. Training will start right away. Do you take Dominik Liebmann to be your lawfully wedded husband. I do. You have both confirmed. I hereby declare you husband and wife. Congratulations, you may now kiss the bride. I don't understand. What does that mean? It means your requisition for custody has been denied. What? But I... But how is that possible? This psychological opinion is not really in your favor. It says you are emotionally immature and indecisive. It says. '...makes an abulic impression...' '...doesn't seem adequate to raise a child, and...' Well, they recommend psychological care or at least therapy. Can't I just repeat the test? It is not really a test in that sense. But we can requisition for another opinion. Okay. But they surely want you to comply with their recommendation. What recommendation? Therapy. Why don't you join our group talks. Then I can write that you participate in group therapy. I don't know. Otherwise your chance to get custody for Dylan is really bad. Okay Dominik, whenever you are ready please. I was on vacation with my friend and his new girlfriend and his girlfriend wanted to set me up with someone. Is this supposed to be a joke? What? This is not a knitting circle here where one chatters with misty-eyed look on his face: 'Oh, it was so much nicer and better in the past!' You already told us how you met your wife. Many times. Sorry I'm in no mood to get bullshitted by this cyclops Dominik doesn't want to bullshit you. He doesn't mean it the way you think. If he doesn't work properly he can leave. Sure, I can leave. Go ahead, leave! Just stop blabbering all this bullcrap Gregor! Sit down, now! Even if I don't like Gregor's manners, he kind of got a point here. If it everything was so great, you wouldn't be here now. Maybe you talk about the times that were not that easy. What about my apprenticeship? Okay? So you would like to be an apprentice? I think that could be good for you. But if not it's okay as well. What kind of profession would you be interested in? Profession? Well, one becomes an apprentice to learn a profession. I don't give a shit what one does. We planned that I'd be an apprentice when I'm in Berlin. That was the plan. You are so stupid! After Dylan turned two she seemed somewhat imbalanced. Maybe she was overburdened with Dylan. Where was Dylan at that time? In a playschool? In kindergarten. Otherwise things would've been even worse. And how long was Angela, as you said, imbalanced? About a year. I am going next door to Roberta. And then? Then it got worse. Hey - Hello Darling. Listen. Now that Dylan is getting on so well in kindergarten maybe I could start working. Do you want to work? Should I work? Do you want me to work? I want you to be happy. Yeah great. Shit, man! What is the matter? I got a job and nothing is the matter. You make me so sick. You got a job? Fuck you! Did she really have a job? Yeah. She was promoting magazine subscriptions in a mall. What a fantastic career move. No real job, just selling magazines in a mall. But she enjoyed doing that. But these promotion chicks are really annoying. But promotion has its place as well. You can't go anywhere without being hassled I just wanted her to be happy. Three steps forward with Oi-sookee Yodan. Third one with Kyai (counts japanese) Thank you, once more. This time just you, Benedict. It's Dominik. Yeah yeah, and hadsh-me. The technique isn't so bad. But Dominik, we're doing martial arts here and not dancing arts. Give me some power - an Oi-sookee with gusto. And you forgot the Kyai. One Oi-sookee with Kyai. I didn't hear anything. Did you guys? - No. The Kyai can let all you aggression out with full energy from your center. Should be no problem for a pirate like you. Yeah very funny. Come on, give me a pirate yell. Okay back in the row, Benedict. Okay, onward with San Bon Sookee. Don't mind Rene. At first everyone has their difficulties. Really? With the Kyai as well? No, but everyone has an area that they're slower in. Some take longer with the foot work. Or with the Kyai? Or with the Kyai! I'm Belinda. Hi Belinda, I'm... Dominik, I know, and not Benedict. Exactly. Hey Belinda, will you be at Canards later? Sure. We're all going for a drink. Maybe you'd wanna join us? Okay. You know, it's more likely to be killed by a large hailstone then to win the lottery. Mathematically speaking. But 67 Million Euro. Think of what you could do with that. With a huge jackpot it's even less likely to win because so many play the lottery. Are you a teacher? No, not directly. So, what do you do? I'm currently. I'm a mathematician. And you? What are you? What I am? Well, let's see, what am I? I am a woman mother attorney at law karate student and a Libra that doesn't believe in astrology. Really? Me neither. I think it's all rubbish. People just see in their zodiac signs just what they want to see. And what's your sign? Cancer. That's so typical cancer, they just don't believe in astrology. Cheers - cheers. We had such a great talk and made plans for a date. I think she's really nice. We will meet this... Dominik, sorry to interrupt you there. Well, it's about time. It's great that you met someone nice but I think you should continue where you left off last time. Great, again at the computer. Hey sweetie. I got a lot work to catch up Dylan is finally asleep. I need a few more minutes? A few minutes? Sure. More like a few hours. I had to leave work early to pick up Dylan from kindergarten because you were out with Roberta. You stupid asshole how can you say I'm a bad mother I didn't say that let's keep it quiet, not to wake Dylan. You fucking prick. Calm down. I don't understand what... You sit there at your computer all high and mighty. You better come down from your high horse. In these situation it's better to de-escalate the situation. I'm almost home. I will email you the file right away. Alright, till then Nina. So are will you meet that Nina-slut? You know that Nina is a colleague of mine. There's no reason to get steamed up about. I'm not steamed up. I don't care if she steams you or you steam her. But you know what. Go fuck your whore. Fuck her and fuck yourself as well. Let's go upstairs, okay? I'd have told that lady she should pull herself together. What could I have done? Scream back and make it even more emotional. What kind of role model are you for your son? You're such a total wimp. I'm a wimp? I fathered a son. I provide for my family by working very hard. I'm a caring father who makes time for his son. Now I'm a wimp, because I don't beat my wife? This is absurd. But just walking away didn't solve the problem either. Besides, it was really difficult for Angela. Being so far from her hometown, her friends, her entire family and becoming a mother being so young I think most men would have felt overburdened. Sure, of the three billion women on this planet she's surely the only one that casts a young. We are really getting to the root of the problem here. I'm not sure what he wants from me. Yeah hello? Hello Belinda, this is Dominik Dominik? Who is Dominik? I was in the karate class we had a drink. And we wanted to you gave me your number. Of course I know who you are. How could I forget you. Ah well, okay then. What about tomorrow? A trip to the countryside? Yeah great! Shall we take your car or mine? My car is in the... shop right now. No problem I'll pick you up at eleven. Where do you live? I won't be home then. I will be at a friend's. Okay I'll be at AkazienstraÃŸe at 11. Okay, see you tomorrow then Dylan will be six. And how old are your girls? Emma is seven and Leoni is five. Ah okay. So what kind of work do you do? I know you're a mathematician but how can I picture your work? Well, I am... Would it be okay if we don't talk about my work? Sure. Look, here it's beautiful wouldn't that be a good place for our picnic? Yeah, super. So I gave him an ultimatum well, and then he moved out. But he sees the kids on a regular basis. With him it's all about competing. He always has to prove himself. Must show he is better than others. That he is better than me. He's always confrontational. I just found it so grueling. Sorry - No problem. There's some left. Good, but stand lower in the Senku Sudatshi. Stand really low. Better, thank you. Okay, Benedict. But this time I want to hear the Kyai. Footwork was okay, but that was no Kyai. I started just a few weeks ago. Doesn't matter, let your aggression out. And once again. Hannah, one Kyai please. So Benedict, she can do a Kyai Hannah, a petite woman with a white belt. That's the power I want. Come on and give me a real pirate yell. And hadsh-me. No, you sound too wussy. Kyai, now! Not so wimpy, Kyai. There's no point in this I'm sorry. Okay then, next is Mae Geiri. It's lovely see you play with the two of them Emma and especially Leoni are usually much more reserved. You gotta real knack for kids. Thanks. Cheers. Don't you miss Dylan? Yes of course. I could see you being a great dad. Thanks, Belinda. I am sorry. It's okay. Maybe
