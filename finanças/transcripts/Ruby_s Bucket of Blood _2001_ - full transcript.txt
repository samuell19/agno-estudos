You ain't got no common sense, Emerald. You like to make me feel small. Emerald Marie Delacroix. -What'd you just say? -Nothing. Don't you accuse me of making you feel small. Yes, ma'am. And don't you yes, ma'am me either with that tone. I don't know what you want me to say, mama. I make you feel small. And why is that? Go on, tell the truth. Because it makes you feel big.

You got another family somewhere, is that where you always go? Is it another woman? Just tell me. Respect me enough to tell me the truth for once. You'll never know. What about Emerald? If she was a boy, I'd take her with me. It won't be long before she spread her legs for some end up like the rest of y'all, weak and stupid, I do nothing for her no more.

Watch out now, Humvee, -you're too young for that. -Everybody's scared, too scared to move, I'm not. -I wanna drink. -You know what? Your momma would kick my butt and then refuse to pay me. And everybody's business. -Can I have a sip of yours? -No. I'll show her who's boss of me. -I'm the boss of you. -See? You go to your room.

I don't wanna play no Dixieland. Yes, if that's it, you can play with Allen Toussaint. That's domino. Noogie's going in down there now. -Yeah? -Yeah. You got a straight job here, you can do the same thing there, what's the difference? You can get a new band, you can get more exposure down there in two weeks you get down here your whole entire life. I don't like that New Orleans sound, I like what we play down here. We got Jim Records, Joe Berry's doing good. -I mean... -We can live in the corner. We can live together. You know, we got a life in New Orleans, being ourselves, being alive, being natural, brother, or you got a life here without me that's lies, and lies, and lies? What are you gonna do if you stay? Well, I know. You're gonna marry sweet Katia Washington and pretend that you're straight. Will you think about that when you're lying in bed with her dreaming about me? Once in a while, you're gonna sneak out, catch a little bit of what you really like, feeling guilty, and crazy, and ashamed. Free yourself, Johnny. Come with me. You know, this thing, uh, went out. -You know, what? -Hey. Thanks, man. I'm heading out. All right? Yeah. You want some? Yeah. Why not? No shit, bud, you sound good in there. You never know when you're gonna catch it right. I guess not. Give me a call, baby, if you change your mind. Goddamn it, Silas, arrêter. this is who I am. Hey, Rub. -Morning, Ruby. -Good morning. Good morning Ms. Emerald. What's the matter with you this morning? Too sophisticated to talk to us. Excuse me. Let me get that girls to help. Emerald, Regina, I need you girls to help. -I'm going with Regina. -Miss Sassy. Since when do you tell and not ask? Come with me. Who do you think you are talking to me like that? I'm not like you. Daddy said. Oh, yeah? Well, what did he say? He said I shouldn't turn into you. I should get out of here. Girl, you don't know nothing about real life. Then tell me. What you want to know? Well, why take college? Why men hate women? So, the worst possible thing you can be is a collared woman? Slave-thinking. See? Daddy's right, I'm not like you. I'm not scared. You don't know. The world look at me and they see a nursemaid, a whore and a mule, rolled up into one, and wonder why I ain't serving there. Oh, they waiting for me to stumble. I pay more so called taxes than anybody, more than these peckerwoods, more than these colored men what run bars in the same parish, and if I don't pay, do you know what kind of accident is gonna happen? I earned that bar from my momma, it's mine. But everybody still wait for your daddy to come from offshore to talk business, and it's my business. As far as this world concerned, a woman like me is in good need of a whooping. Now, when you learn to stay low, you will be all right. I won't stay low. I can't be like that, ma. I'm different than you. So you said. Good afternoon, Miss Daigie. Hey. Not short again this month, are we, Ruby? No, ma'am. Not short this month. Well, well. What a pretty business that is. Thank you. I heard you pre-cut out, aren't you? -He came back, though. - That's good. When's Noogie coming home? Next week. Well, tell Earl to call me. He's offshore. Is there anything I could-- Well, how long is he out for, fourteen or seven? I don't know. Earl does seem to stay out longer than most. Well, don't worry. I'll keep an extra special line. Thank you. Here's your change, honey. Thank you. See you. Hello, Texaco, may I help you? Yes, hello. I wanna send a letter to my husband, so I need to find out what rig he's on. What's his name? Earl Delacroix. Hang on, honey. Sorry. He no longer works at Texaco. That is not possible. They said that he didn't show up last week. Uh... Are you sure? I'm looking right here at the paperwork, missus. -Thank you. - Goodbye. Hey, son. Hey, pop. Listen, Silas tells me you're going to be moving. Qu'est-ce que tu dis, Silas? Huh? No, no, pop, Silas just pulling your leg, I ain't going nowhere. Well, that's what I thought. You know, because, uh, you've got a sweet deal back there, and you know it. And that's what I'm telling him. I can't see you giving us up for some roach filled slave part of New Orleans where you don't know no nobody. That could be a foolish thing to do. And you ain't no fool. I ain't no fool. But we're not too sure about Silas now, are we? Yeah. Silas. But you're trying to cut me off from everybody that I know and love so I only have you to turn to? I'm not going nowhere with you, man. -You screwed up. -Screwed up? Who screwed up? Me, who wants to live who I am without shame? Or you? You, who's desperately trying to hide his dirty little secret. Hmm, but let me see. That would have to be you. You don't know me. Never will. How can you say that, huh? I know you better than anybody. I'm a man... with a family. I got seven brothers and sisters. I got 15 nieces and nephews. I'm from a place. I know every inch of those woods behind my house, and how they change from season to season. I know everybody in the music scene. And my house is their house, and they know it. And they need that. And I like giving it. I'm a man from a place with family and friends, first, and I'm a homosexual, second. But that's because they just don't know you, baby. How do you think your daddy would react if he knew that you like boys? I don't need to hurt him like that. Oh, no. You'll just hurt yourself. Don't come here no more. I... -I wanted... -I mean it. What do you say, Johnny? Don't come here no more, Silas. Why are you sitting in the dark? -Cut that off. -Why? Because I said. What's for supper? You didn't cook? You always cook. What's the matter? You are a grownup, you cook something. -Daddy? -Hey, there, little one. Hmm. I thought you were offshore? No, no. No more rough necking for me. I've been to New Orleans, huh? Watch your present. Go ahead, open it. - Earl, come on! Yeah, yeah. Come on, baby. What's this for? Because you a young lady. I've never had stockings before, though. Yeah, I know. It's time. Because you are a beautiful young lady. Oh, is that good? My sweet . I'mma miss you. Where are you going? Can you keep a secret? Cross my heart, hope to die. Uh-hmm. I'm going to California. -What you think of that? -Can I go? Come on, Earl. Let's go! Yeah. Oh. Well, uh, no, baby, no. Uh, not now, later on. After I'm all setup. You can come out for a visit, okay? -Yes, sir. -Okay. Remember, never be afraid. You're just as good as anybody. Better than most. Right, you know that already. Earl! Baby, you know I love you, right? You do? Aye. What you think? Always? Always. Forever. So when you coming home, tonight? So when you coming in? Could you leave me in peace? Where are you playing? Same place they'll have me. Ooh. What's the matter neighbor, can't you do any better than that? You should be more uptown, a man of your talent, or are you drinking your talent away? Did that crazy wife of yours drive you to drink your talent away? Did that woman ruin your life? Or did you ruin hers? -Hey, Billy -Hey, how you doing? What's up, man? How about yourself. You're looking good, as usual, Mrs. Delacroix. Where's Earl? I don't know. And I don't think he's coming back. And why is that? You. What did I do? He didn't appreciate me dancing with you. Come on. You're joking. No, don't worry, I wasn't really hit. And he's in a mood to go. Let me tell you what. He's a foolish man to leave you. Known him since I was seven years old. Well... Well, he always walked in a light of pride. He wouldn't hunch over for nobody. That's what I loved about him. Standing full, tall. He's a beautiful man. And it's the one that he ain't been killed for that. You know, he was decorated in the war. I didn't know that. Sharpshooter. Yeah. You know, he sure hit the mark when he found you. I have to-- I have to check on him. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm doing this book report for the summer program at the library. Uh-hmm. What book? Reconstruction in the Old South. Hmm, they're still going on, ain't it? Yeah. A very good girl. Hmm. You're gonna be first ever go to college. You smell like men's cologne. Really? Hmm. Must be Johnny's. Okay, uh, are you sure you're all right? -Yeah? -Yeah. All right. -Don't stay up too late. -I won't. All right. Now here's favorite pasttime. Wine, wine, wine. Ooh, let's go. Yeah, let's go. What did you drink? Man, I can't drink no more. Say, baby, so we can go in and have us some fun. Oh. Yo, it's too bad. No, he's coming back tomorrow. I know. Come on. Bring that on, baby. -Chicken. - I am not. I thought you were joking. You did not. You can't let me go by myself. Then don't. Go home, nut. -Regina. Regina! Please. Please stop. Please stop. Come on. - You want a ride? I'm going to go check on Emerald. Cover me. Emerald. Jack? -Jack. - What, baby? -Emerald is gone. - Gone where? I don't know. Uh, run away? Well, did she take her clothes? She was talking about Chicago. She wanted to go to-- Oh, my gosh. She's probably going toward the bus in Lafayette. I need to borrow your car. No, no. I'll take you myself. - Oh, Ruby, maybe... -Oh, you guys. Don't tell me. She's probably just walking toward Lafayette. Jack, would you go get her and bring her back? -We'll get her. -We're going. We're going. Yeah, what's up, man? How are you doing ? All right. - How you doing, baby? -Hi. Hi. Let's go. Excuse me, sir? Excuse me. Rum and Coke! Over here! Ponchy. Ponchy! -Rum and Coke! -Yeah. I'll be right there. Thank you. My pleasure. So how come I never seen you around. -Just passing through. So what's your name? Emerald. You certainly are. What's yours? Mr. Right to you. - Good show, Ruby. -That's a good show, Ruby. -All right. Goodnight, Ruby. -Bye. -See you. -Bye-bye. -Bye-bye. -Have a good night, ma'am. -Night. You want some company? No. Sure? I'd have enough trouble to be talking to a white man in the middle of the night. Well, what trouble you got? Nothing. Ruby. What's going on? Well, what do you want from me? Go home to your wife. It's crowded over there. Come on, darling. Come on. No. You're wild, little thing. I like that. -Come on, let's go. -No. Get off of me. -Come on, let's go. -Get off of me. -Let go of me. -What? May I cut in? 15? What you all staring at? It's okay, it's okay. It's Emerald. -Is she-- -She had enough. Emerald, Emerald. Are you okay? You know, the funny thing is, I raised her to have all this spirit, this spunk, and every time she shows that, I just get so scared. And I know this world is gonna try to bring her down to her knees. I thought they'd be back by now. You're such a little momma, you know that? You got children? We had one... but we lost her. Sorry. Betty was in a car wreck and... she flew sideways and... hit the baby and... died instantly. Thing is, I was passed out in a barn, they were coming to pick me up. So, it's all your fault. Three... four seconds... been a different world. See, I can't seem to shake those three seconds. Hmm. You know, sometimes all it takes is a few seconds to turn your life in the right direction. One... two... Where have you been? Girl, where have you been? Over at Petrie's. And how did you get there? And you better tell me the truth. Hitchhiked. Girl, have you lost your mind? Do you know where you are? This is the segregated south and you are a negro. It's the middle of the night. I will not have my daughter beat and rape as a joke by some drunk white man. -Ma, I'm all right. -By the grace of God, Emerald, I could just beat you. I could just shake you until you get some sense. -I'm sorry. -Go to your room before I decide to beat you right now. Please don't talk to me like that. I'll talk to you any way I want to. No. I'm sorry I disappointed you. But I'm not a dog, so don't talk to me like one. Jack, Bootsie, I owe you. You don't owe me nothing, sheriff. -Good night. -Good night. Well, hey, Dupre. You had some night. Just keeping her company while she wait. -I'm heading out. -Good. Bonsoir. -Bonsoir. -Bonsoir, mon ami. Mommy. I'm sorry, Emerald. I'm sorry, too. But I'm not sorry. It's hard to know what's right to do sometimes. What are you doing? I don't know. I see your light on and... I mean, you still got my driver's license. -Can I come in? -Emerald's asleep. Come. I can't do this. Why? Because people get killed for it, that's why. You're a handsome man. Well, thank you. Women tell you that often? No. Don't lie. I'm sorry. You won't be sorry for telling the truth. From all the goings-on around here, I see. I ain't like that. Couldn't stop thinking about you. All I wanna do is touch you again. I never been with another man. Save myself for marriage and then kept my promise ever since. Now, can you feature that? Road house queen of St. Mary parish. Got no idea how beautiful you are, do you? Hmm. No, you don't. How long you'd been hiding? How long you'd been waiting? I see you, Ruby. I don't understand why I feel like I know you. I don't know you. You do know me. I know you make me feel like I'm crazy. Like I don't wanna... Shine, Ruby. Do I? Shh. Come on. I smell like cigarettes and beer. Me, too. So, what? Uh... I'm not-- I mean, if you don't want. Shh. Shh. Shh. You're gonna wake Emerald. You're the one making all the noise. -Well, if you stay away from me. -You know I can't. No. No. No. No. No. If you tickle me one more time I'mma lose my mind. You got a weakness and I found it. Come here. No. No. No. -Don't you tickle me. -Okay. Okay. Promise. No more tickling behind the knees. You're the devil and I don't believe you. Open the door. Open the door. Bar's closed. Sounds to me like you're doing some business in there. This is my place. I want you gone, I'mma call the sheriff. I don't think you have to do that with a white man in there. -I'll go ahead back. -Go. You got to get her out of here. Billy! Billy, I've got to tell you something. I'll go get my things. I need to talk to you. Dupre, open the door. Billy, please open the door. He's coming. He'll be here in a minute. I want you to listen to me. You never listen to me. When you stay out, when you come home, everything about you hurts me. I waited for you tonight, because I was gonna tell you that I forgive you. And I was gonna ask you to forgive me. And then you didn't come. And I knew that nobody's ever gonna forgive anybody. What's your name? Ruby. Oh, you. Did you enjoy my husband? It didn't mean anything. It does to me. Do you have a husband? Yes. Does he do this? Yes. I don't know why it cuts me so deep. Betty, I... I'm sorry this happened. -I'm sorry-- -You are sorry you got caught. And that's it. Don't lie. Don't lie. You know, you're right. I'm not sorry it happened. I can't live like this anymore. Our son may be gone, but you and I, we're both still alive. We can let go, hmm? We can let go. It's gonna be all right. Nothing will ever be all right again. No. No. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Don't move. Hold on. Hold on. Can we call somebody? You shot him. Can we get help? He's dead. Oh, man. Where's Ruby? I don't know. I came as fast as I could. What the hell happened here, Ruby? Qu'est que ça? You didn't shoot him, did you? She did it. But it don't matter. They'll get me on my knees because of it. I can't let Emerald see that. No. Ms. Betty would tell them what happened. -She won't lie. -I never lie. You see, she'll tell them the truth. And nobody will think you did anything. It doesn't matter. They'll know I slept with a married white man and he got killed because of me. The door is open, Johnny, I'll never get it shut. Earl's gone, Johnny. It's just me against all of them. I got to get Emerald out of here before it all starts. Leave it. I'll tell them I was with Dupre, she came, they got in a fight and she shot him. I saw everything. You were in the back. Not even here. You think she's gonna lie for me. I never lie. No more lies. I'll never get away if I don't do it right now. Johnny, I wanna give you the deed to my building in exchange for your car. But you were born here. This is yours. I won't let them take my dignity because I forgot my place -for a few minutes. Because I acted human for once. Where's the phone? Johnny... do this favor for me. Take the deed to the Bucket of Blood. No, this is too much. Just... -Just take the car. - No, no, please. I know it will be in good hands. Do it for me. Emerald! Emerald! Ma, did you shoot him? -No. -Then why are we running? We're not running. Ma! Leave me. Don't push me down. I didn't do anything to be ashamed of. -Neither did I. -Then don't act like it. I'm doing this for you. No. You're scared... -like always. -You're damn right I'm scared. And smart to be scared. Is it smart to run like a criminal -when you're not a criminal? -I might risk it if it was just me, but I can't take the chance with you. Your daddy, he's gone. And he ain't coming back. I know. You knew? Then what happens if I get jailed for this? What happens to you? Livin' beneath the bars? But what if you don't? Don't get jailed for this? Then we just live with a scandal. Small towns don't ever forget. Mommy, I'm okay. If I don't leave today, I'll leave soon. So don't do this for me. Don't hide behind me. What do you need to do? Dupre. He was so kind to me. God! I thought for a second he might be able to save me. Maybe he did. I should have left a long time ago. Let's get out of here. Are you scared? No. First time in a long time. Not scared at all. One, two, three...
