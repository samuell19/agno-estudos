Mr. Boggs, I don't think Don can read. I think he should be held back another year. I'm afraid we can't do that, Mrs. Lopez. Don was held back in the third grade. The law allows us to hold a student back only once in his school life. We are doing him an injustice, letting him graduate without the ability to read. We have to obey the law Mrs. Lopez. Now, there are hundreds of students in this school. We can't help them all. Let me assure you Mrs. Lopez, I think you're doing the right thing with Don. But, if I call on him to read, he leaves the classroom. - Then don't call on him. - I'm sorry Mr. Boggs. I just don't feel right about it. Are you alright? Just a hangover from a bachelor party last night. Oh, what a party. By the end of the evening, the groom was a verbal dyslexic. [polite laughter] Thank you Mr. Boggs. - Thank you for your help. - Oh, anytime Mrs. Lopez. An A Tina? Don, you can't make an F into a C. An F has to either be an A or a B. Then why not a B? Because the A was easier to make. You never said thank you. - I didn't want an A. - Then maybe you should just keep the F. Hey... I'm sorry okay? We have a bigger problem than your F, Don. What? I think I'm pregnant. Then we'll get married. I want you to marry me because you love me. Not because I'm pregnant. I love you Tina.
