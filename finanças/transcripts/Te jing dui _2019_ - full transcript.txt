We reload. Hit the targets not it's like being on the field. Already. The pressure is much higher. But it's more fun. I can not believe it. Look what you've done! Good evening. Turn off the car and show me the documents. It arrived just in time, look. I was waiting for it to turn green, and that gentleman there came upon me . I'll handle that. Hey, officer! My car is also wrecked. He will be drunk. Turn off the car and give me the documents. I just bought it! Idiot. Lord did you hear what I said? Come on, there's nothing to see. But what does it do? What is it, now you also want to escape? Get out of the car. Officer, don't let me escape! Stop! Get out of my way. Stop! Vehicle heads east. Received, we see. This is an order. Stop the car immediately. They chase me, I have to escape. Team two. Agree. Received. What's your name? The cop who got hurt. The boys could pass this way. Team two reporting. We are ready. Hello, commander. He is Captain Liu Liang. Well. We must act quickly. Commissario Guo Zhigang. Ladies in report. The man entered the subway station after hitting a policeman. Stop! They chase me! Ehi you! Lower the knife. Get back, get back! He knows him? We've already caught him twice. Suffers from severe persecution delusions caused by drugs I know you want to kill me. Stay back, or I'll kill her. Go there. Take him alive. But if you can't help it, shoot. If you use guns , he will certainly notice. It is easy to notice them, they are not good. So we'll have to use a sniper. But we don't have coverage. Bad situation. I have an idea. When I tap my foot you shoot. All right? Okay. The hostage is in grave danger, let's not waste time. We must act now. Here we go. Liao. It is not an exercise Do not worry. Okay? Go away. I don't want cops Believe me. I'll kill this girl go away! Listen, doing this won't do any good. Who are you?

Do you want some water? It is poisonous. I don't drink it, I don't drink it! Okay, then I'll drink first. Listen. She's just a little girl, am I right? He's innocent, he didn't do anything to you, right? I'll take his place. You can do what you want to me. No, I don't believe you! Do you want to kill me. No it is not true. Look. I didn't even bring a weapon. She will kill me. I don't think that girl wants to kill you Now please take the knife away from the girl, okay? Hey, I'm talking to you. Now look at me, listen.

Ah Liao, you did very well today, congratulations. One shot and baml, the guy fell. It wasn't easy, the target kept moving. I know, it's great. The best sniper on our team. Stop it, please. Really, you shot well. That's not true, I missed that bastard. But it's not your fault he moved. There is something new. Would be? Well, according to some rumors ... A girl will come to the team. Thing? A girl? How would it be? Who said it? Sorry, confidential information. So you missed the mark, How the hell did you do it? Just had a shot and pam! Where did he hit him? Shot him in the head? No, on the neck I told you, a little more and he shot the hostage. Do you want to get them today? Are you talking to me? What do you have against my friend? Guys. Do you have much longer? Cut it out The team 2 she is too touchy. As you said? Come on, stop it. And why should we? Why veil says team captain one. So? That's enough. Exercise tomorrow let's see who wins. Well. Let's go. By the way. Where is your captain? Hello, officer. The emergency care is now finished. He needs help? No thanks. What can we do? You have to stay here, I'm preparing for the surgery. Did you go to school together? He was my best friend in college. It's been a long time, but we still talk We should have played a game in a few days. I can not believe. To improve your skills in the field and better protect civilians, I have devised special training. I hope you will do your best. Training is essential. We understood each other? Sam, welcome. I am Peng. But why are you looking at me? Also, I have decided to assign a female member to both team one and team two. Lord! Team one welcomes you. Lord! Instead team two doesn't need women. Can you tell me who's giving the orders here? Sure! It's you, sir - Na Mei. - Sir Team one. Yup. Guo Qiaonan. Sir. Team 2. Yup. You will simulate a hijack. Team 1 you are the criminals. Yes, sir! We will complete the mission. Yes, sir. We will do our job and we will foil the attack. Ehm, Guo Qiaonan? You don't need to take part in the training. Why never? Captain, I think- Okay. Shut up. Listen. In team two we are already ten, Each already has its role. We are full. It seems to be an important one. Hong Bing, however, remained hidden in the car. Mr. Zhan. Be comfortable, sit down. Remember, it is forbidden to hit the head. And put on your goggles. Yes, don't worry. Pay attention. What are you doing here? Get moving! There are a total of 16 doors on the plane. If they are closed, it is practically impossible to access the inside. These bullets are dangerous. Look here. We are only at the beginning and a hostage is already dead. G to. It's true! Gentlemen, the exercise begins. Roll down the windows now! Let's lower them. They are serious. However, there must be a blind spot. Yes, right here. It's under the wing, see? Is this how we will do business? You know very well how it works. There is no need for suppliers to meet in person So ... He turned around again. Why do you want to see me? I would like us to define the rules. That's enough. Well, I repeat the rules once again. If you get hit three times, you're out. It is as if you were dead. Now everyone put your heads down! I cover you. Stay back I'll handle that, I do it by myself. Lord, tell him to calm down, those chairs are extremely expensive. Yes, he should tell him. But what is he talking about? Well here, the budget- Does it matter more than human lives? He's right. Fine. I think they made it. Rest assured, I'm here for you. Well It scared me. I love those guys. Do not say anything. Remember that you are dead Stop! Stop, or I'll shoot her. Lower the weapon. I'll count to three. If you shoot, I'll kill her. One, Due, Stop there. Don't try to move, Turn off that light, it blinds me. Power! Lower the shield. I'll count too. One two- Lower your weapons. Or kill her. But I don't count. You are dead ... you fall. Huh? I am dead? Will I kill another? We will win. Arrendetevi. But how many shots have you fired? Long. This is a foul. Stay down. I am Captain Liu Liang. Team two Thank you all. You are now safe. Everything is alright? Do you want to sit down? Do not touch me! I'm Na Mei, from team 1. I don't need help. Well. The tutorial is over. Team 2 eliminated most of the criminals, however one hostage was killed. Several mistakes have been made . Therefore the winning team èla1. Compliments. We are the best. Well done, well done. The game of life. Obey the rules, and win. You look like a cop. He's not all wrong. I was joking, Be quiet. Americans! I have a question. My product is called "Rainbow" Why do you now call Me "Red"? Is simple. You only understand if you try it. And you did it? Yes sure. See, it's like everything turns red. What color do you see? Oh, I don't do drugs. It would be impossible. There is nothing impossible. Red is increasingly popular on the market. So I'm confused: sales are skyrocketing, but the revenue is lower. I wonder how this is possible. Don't let me down, Ted. Why don't we keep talking about it over something to drink? Okay. Here we go. Stop playing. 1... 2... 1... 1... 2... 3... 4 E alt! Come on, another round. Hey, Yan! Watch out for your back! You'll get a tear. Oh, shut your mouth. Do you need a hand? They look heavy. You have no chance against team one. There is no comparison! Team two has nothing to envy you. We are stronger. True, guys? Long live team one! Two-team! One, two, one One, two. Team one, another round! Team 2! Team 2! We are great. On the right! Brava. Very good Free. Free. Excellent aim. Aim well in training. What do you mean? That I'm not good on the pitch? You think about it too much. Hey, Peng. That customer is cool, isn't he? He's an idiot who likes to be seen. It will end badly, trust me. Drug trafficking is our worst enemy. And it must be defeated. This operation cannot possibly fail. Mr. Zhan. Sit down. Force. This new drug causes severe hallucinations and bouts of violence. One example is the criminal Jia Wei, who hired her. This man is Hong Bing, a trafficker. It is said that he is producing a lot of them. And he's in contact with foreign criminals. Recently, east of the city began to actively operate a new gang. We think many of them are Hong Bing minions. We intend to hit them tonight. We will need yours. It is a very delicate operation. Certainly. How many are there in all? About fifteen. We'll make it. But it is not easy to recognize them. Well, mostly it's not easy to get them. Exactly, they are all well placed. It will take two or three men for each of them. You can count on us ... We won't let you down. Neither do we, sir. I warn you that they are very fast. Who's the best? I 'll take it. And he. And who is the boss? This. This is a very complex operation. You will have to ensure the safety of the people, so no weapons. Okay. There is a woman among the suspects, so the girls will come too. Now get to work! Yes, sir. There is the big fish, but nothing else. Leave the boss alone, look for the others. Sit down. That Hong Bing is a supplier. He never makes contact with the gang. Unfortunately we don't know where the drug is made. Today we must try to extract this information from him. It must have a weakness. Romantic evening. Shut that mouth. You have to act. Stay focused. Look for the men in the photo. Once you have found them keep your eyes on him. Don't miss them. Please, we count on you. Found yours? For a while already. Well, they said it runs fast. I'll put it to the test. II tuo? It's behind you. I don't know what he's good at. Do not touch me. What is happening? Go away. Do we intervene? Help, please help me. Yup. Enjoying the show, huh? You are cowards. Yes, everyone, off those phones! Can you only use those? Let's go away. They've been a little careless. So they make themselves known. Those are smart. They have a nose for cops. They also recognize them from a distance. Please, keep your eyes on the targets. Please, keep your eyes on the targets. Another thing. Forget the customers. We will deal with this later. I'll show you a person. Okay, I've seen it. He gave something to another. It is called Xiao Bai. I know he sells my products, but you don't know him, right? I do not understand. This is my product, right? Of course. That drug ruins people's lives. It damages the liver and gallbladder. And then the brain. Those who use it become paranoid and violent. We just worked on a case of a drug addict who killed his mother. Well. It's funny, huh? It looks like mine. Whoever counterfeited it is - he's really good. But there is a small difference, and that is greater quantity, but lower quality. Like the price. Now I'll explain. Okay. Received. More fish arrive. Listen to me well. Who is inside starts first, Liu, you wait for a later You have to be fast. It starts in a minute. I don't like this lot at all. It's a steaming pile of shit. I assure you that with the next load it will be much better. Enough with the bullshit. Now tell me where you make the drug. You and I make a great team. Didn't you hear me? I said stop bullshit. I want to know: where do you produce it? And just out of curiosity. Well, obviously we can't risk being caught by the police. My lab is a long way from here. I don't care. I want to go there now. Okay alright. We are ready. Police! Don't worry, they have no hope against my boys. Stop! Get out of my way. Police. You are under arrest. Liu Lang. Haven't seen you in a lifetime. Last time you promised you'd call me back. Nice shirt. Why glasses? They refine my face. Are you still a cop? Get away! Come on, this is too easy. Police! Police! You are under arrest. Stop! And rest! That's all? Are you kidding me? I'll handle that. I'm getting bored to death. Go faster, come on. You can do it. Ready. Street! Come on. Courage. Are you tired already? What a disappointment. Come with me. I am placing you under arrest in the name of the Blue Sword Commando. I apologize. You were in the air force before being a mercenary. I guess crime pays more than the army. You have to be a real tough guy. Forget it. He won't say a word. Why did he come to China? Because I like it. I love everything about this country: the spring rolls and a movie by Jackie Chan, il kung fu. Do you practice kung fu? When I was a boy yes, but then as I got older I found that guns are a little more effective. We have little time. Do you think we brought her here for a chat? Um, since I haven't done anything wrong ... I can't see another reason. Sam Moore? Yes I am. We understand that you are a businessman. And also the president of a pharmaceutical company here in Asia. And he committed two serious crimes: armed robbery. What is the other? He escaped from prison. He's good. He's good. Thank you. But it was a long time ago, I changed. I am a better man. Now, if you do not mind, I would ask you to let me go. I am but a victim in this whole story. Stop. It's not easy. It hurts? No, it's nothing. Stop that. You need to rest. No way. The team needs me. Yeah, for sure. True, Zhao? Shut up. What did I do to you? You have also been injured. You should understand how he feels. Captain, the thing is, man that he bit hides a terrifying secret: a disease. Thing? What do you mean? Isn't that what I think? Anger. E g rave? It has a very high mortality. Let's hope it doesn't bite us. Doctor. By chance did the instant ice? It is there. Help yourself. Listen: Zhao has anger. Do you think there is something to worry about? Zhao. If I were you, I'd get checked out. It's not that easy. It's a bastard virus. Yeah, but we'll be by your side. True, guys? Wait. It just happened. Are you so sure? Sure. And how? Well. Have fun. I'll show you who has anger. Beware it bites you. Today you have stood up. I am proud of you, you should celebrate. You are the best team anyone could wish for. Ah, can you offer us a beer? Don't worry about what happened It can happen to anyone. Let me give you some advice: the training does not reflect reality. It's something else out there. Already. This is your chance. Melo are slipped from the fingers. Do not get mad. You did your best. Are you ready for tomorrow? Sure. Good night. Out. No, you don't Peng. Stay here. We found nothing against them. What a pity. I do not trust. If they try to set foot in China, we'll make them pay for it. I'm leaving. Yesterday you disappeared without saying goodbye. I'm sorry. I didn't call the police. I have one last question: last night an informant told me you are preparing a new product shipment. Pretty big. I consider your informant is not reliable. Listen, I ask you for the last time: where the hell produce all your drug? The I don't know what you are talking about. Then screw you. The deal jumps. Leave yesterday's mission behind and focus. Be careful. Received. Here we are. Let's start with a chase. Terrorists win if they manage to escape. Three suspicious vehicles in sight. Stop now, in the name of the law. To all mobile units: The other team's vehicles are armored. We can't compete with them. We are lighter. He destroyed it. They are serious. Nice car. That's not fair. It cost a lot. Do you like to win easy. Very well. Team one won the first test. The next stage involves a direct armed confrontation between the two teams. Don't be a bully, it's just the beginning. The purpose of the mission is to annihilate the opposing team. You are a member of the special forces, the trump card in the war against crime. You can face any situation and overcome any obstacles. Guys, we lost the first round. But now it's time to get serious. Give it your all, okay? Qiaonan? I'm not leaving. I fight like a man. Could you repeat? I can fight like a man. Here are the rules: this time you will be eliminated if you are hit five times. Go ahead. Good luck. I am an equal. Return the fire. Courage! Sniper! Get down! I forgot. If the sniper hits you, you're out. Retreat! Sniper eliminated. Chief, everything is ready. Last night at the club you defended me without thinking about it. I have to admit you surprised me. Thank you. Capo. Is that guy really the president of a pharmaceutical company? There is nothing he can do about it, stay calm. He doesn't seem like the type to let go. In your opinion how did he know about Red 's new cargo? Someone must have spoken. Quite right. Have your men been arrested? Not all of them, one has escaped. It is not fair. You have armor. You have an advantage, as before. First the vehicles, now the vests. This is too easy. Aren't you ashamed? He is absolutely right. Take this! Stop. Cease-fire! Liu! Let's go out into the open. Because? What's up? You are scared? Of course not. I'll make you a proposal. Why do n't we take off our jackets? I'm in. Gone. Soldiers. In line, now! Sir, what's going on? Then? Are you okay now? There is a problem: how do we distinguish the teams? Are you ready to lose? And you? This time it gets serious. Guys, let's do your ass. Let's show them. We don't need jackets Come on! Come on! We in attack, you in defense. It always ends like this. They take it too personally. You didn't say that you are like a man? Forget it, I'm kidding. Here we go. That's right. That's what I said. Hey, what are you doing? In your opinion? What did you expect? Nice turtle, Rambo. Cover me. I'm dry. Unfortunately me too. They never give up, do they? Yan, let's move on to the melee? Sounds like a great idea to me. How about bring me some coffee, huh? Captain. Take it higher, I took the rifle. Sorry, Yan. Nothing personal That's enough. Since Liu Lang was shot, team one wins. Again. Yes, we won! Agents, you are wrong. Speak up. No- I have nothing to do with this story You better talk. I want a lawyer. Dreams towel He won't say a single word. I'm not going to stay here all day. If this continues, we have no choice. This here is a tough nut to crack. What do we do with him? I have an idea: why don't we frame him? I'll blame you. Let them take the blame No, please. Hey, wait. I will speak, I will speak. You are truly evil. Who's the Boss? It is called Xiao Bai. It's Xiao Bai, but I don't know anything else. Where are you from? Dude, I'm Chinese. Let's chat. Agree. Where have you grown up? Guangdong. In a region in the far north of China. I do not feel well. Let's go to the island. Now? What do you think? Hey, boss. Let me come. Please. So you hurt me. Stay still. Or it won't help. That's where you were. Look, this place is not a spa. Hey, be careful. You left me some bruises too. Captain, this is from Liu Lang. We have exaggerated. Have you seen Zhao and Wen Gang? Damn. If they are given to bad. Exact. They have exaggerated. Who is it? Were you talking about me? Because? Curiosity? Yes and then? What are you doing here? I just wanted to give you this back. Thank you. Did Liu Lang send you? Chi? The captain. Yes, it is. Thanks, Zhao. Is there anything else? Do you want to take my place? Stop that. Don't be silly. Look, see you tomorrow? Sure. I leave you calm. Okay. Good night. Use it. Liao, I know you are capable. Don't overthink it when you pull the trigger. The apple has kidnapped me. I am a hostage. Hit it. No matter what happens, you just have to be able to center- Liao, listen to me. Think about what you have learned in your training The apple is just a target. No, it is not. Now focus, okay? Liu, where are you? Who is it? I'm Zhao. The commander wants to talk to you. Tell him I'll go to him as soon as possible. Okay, Liao. Let's continue for a while What's up? You are scared? We will have to support the drug team. The man who escaped us has finally been tracked down. He is hiding in a hotel with two other suspects. The police informed us that they resisted. They are armed to the teeth and it seems that they took the cleaning lady hostage . The building has fifty floors in total. The three suspects are in forty-fifth. Divide into two groups and break in from within and without simultaneously. Our mission is to save the innocent. And we will do it at any cost. They mustn't hurt the hostage. Make sure those traffickers don't have time to react. Hey friend. Can you hear me? Why don't we talk about it? On the far right. Don't hurt the hostage. Here we go. Wait up. It is a little high. Seriously? During the training you were very sure of yourself. Only because there was Qiaonan. Yes, but it wasn't fifty floors. You are a soldier. Many people trust you. Now try not to disappoint them. Agree. Courage. Shut up. Open the door. Listen, do you live to talk about it? What are you doing? Do you have any requests? There are too many. We have no hope. Let's talk about. It's not too late yet. Take the gun and aim for the head. Now please calm. What the fuck are you doing? I told you to keep it pointed at the door, Police, you are under arrest! Don't move. Drop the gun! Get it under! Stop! Not the dog! Get it off me! I don't want to die. Help me. I don't want to die. Help me. Stop moving. Save me, please. Zitto. Do not leave me. I'm here, brother. I'm here too. You are late. Thank you guys. Long live the police. Shut up. Are you OK? I was going to get it under. Do not tell anyone. Good job. You can say it for sure. Courage. I think I need a long vacation. A new shipment of drugs is on the way. A big one. From where? From an island, but I don't know where it is. Veil I swear. If you don't cooperate, I bring the dog here. Please don't do this. Are you afraid of the dogs? My terrorizano. He is my baby. Because? Please wait here. We need to get him out of the room. Don't take it away. Pass Permit. I can not believe it. You left Mom all alone. Greeting. Thanks, young man. You don't have to play on the street. Public security just cleared our operation We have to act, and fast. The drug team will give you the details. According to the data collected, Hong Bing has a laboratory located on this island. Here are the pictures. It is very far from the coast and the structure seems abandoned for some time. Obviously, this is a cover. Drugs come and go. The island is very small and inaccessible. It won't be easy to get close without being spotted. The good news is we have a man in the gang. It is called A Fu. He'll help us infiltrate the island. Hong Bing is on the island with his accomplices. We don't know how many. But they are armed and dangerous. Um, based on the information we have, I suggest sending a small team made up of SWAT members. They will leave during the night to attack at dawn, sir. I entrust the task to the Blue Sword Commando, but we'll have to organize reinforcements. That trafficker must be stopped at any cost. Everything is clear? Yes sir. We will take it. Be careful. It is an important mission. I will choose six of you to carry it out. You will have to fight the enemy alone, like a real team. I'll call you by name, okay? Liu Lang. Yes, sir! - Yan Zhong. - Agli ordini! Zhao Hai-long. Yes, sir! Wen Gang. Yes, sir! Liao Xingliang. Yes, sir! Zhang hm. Yes, sir! Sir. What's up? They are all men. That's right. It is an important mission. That's exactly the point, sir. Today, at the hotel, they had taken a girl hostage. The presence of female agents- That's enough. So do I have to be accountable to you for my decisions? Favoritism is often done. I don't want that to happen on our team. These are all excuses. I understand that you want to be part of this mission. But this is a high-risk operation. Sir. I can do it. Are you really sure? Sir. He fights like a man. I assure you. Guo Qiaonan. Yes, sir. Come on. Yes sir. I advise. Don't take any chances. Yes sir. Power. It's your time. It comes back in one piece. Quiet. Leave him alone. It will be child's play. You will see. We'll make it. There are only two minutes left. Where is Liu? He had work to do. Are you ready? You only have thirty seconds. From now. Take aim and shoot without hesitation I believe in you. Twenty seconds my life will be in your hands. Could it be that you can't? Power! If you don't shoot, will give it another bite. You will be under Liu Lang's orders. Yes sir. Remember that your companions are like brothers and sisters. Trust them agree? I will await your return here Mr. Hong is here. Welcome. Mr. Hong. Welcome. This place is Iurido. The kitchens of many restaurants are dirtier. Look here how wonderful. Do not do it! It's-it's-it's-it's-raw. Because? What can happen if you take it raw? Die or go crazy. Not bad. When do you think this shipment will be ready? Tomorrow. Yes? What happens? You look worried. Huh? I almost forgot. My suitcase. You are ready? Left. To the boat. Gentlemen. The team has one hour to reach the goal. Take them out. Power. One each. What do we need them for? No more questions. You too, come on. You attract too much attention. You are imprudent. That's why they sit with their breath on their necks. It's all your fault. Ah! A Fu. I know everything. You've been with us for six months and I've been keeping an eye on you. Something was wrong. Didn't you say you never graduated? But I found out that you also have a degree. And that you wanted to join the police. You came here to be a hero and instead you will end up like the rat. Fermi. Don't move. The weapons. Put them on the ground. Did you hear me? Power. You too. I decided we were going to kill you here. Get it. Sir. Fu sent a signal. What do you mean? It's a call for help. Wait. Do not touch me. He was wearing a tracker. The signal went out. Time to talk, okay? Power. When will the police arrive? Wasn't this a safe place? How will he find you? When it arrives, you will already be dead. Gentlemen, we'll be there in five minutes. It's getting serious this time. Be quiet. No. Don't go. We still talk. And what about? I want to know why you make this stuff. This drug you call Red, Red was the name of my fiancée. One day he started taking drugs. He couldn't stop Now she is dead. She killed herself. When did it happen, When did it happen, That drug - it has terrible consequences, - What consequences has it had? Urinary incontinence. It is incurable. Incurable! Here because I want this shit sold everywhere. Because I want that more and more people realize that it is better to die rather than keep living in this fucking world. Mr. Hong, a boat is coming. Who I am? Fishermen, I would say. Something wrong. It is all ready? And the raw product? Leave it here. Hurry up. Mr. Hong, there is another boat. But this is a yacht. It's strange, you don't see many in this area. If they're not careful, they'll crash into those rocks over there. But that's Sam. How did he find out where we are? It must have been A Fu, he sold us. They are still, what do they do? They must have spotted us That bastard is here to take our drugs. Wait a moment. It wasn't A Fu, someone betrayed us. You two, Iegatelo What are you waiting for? Be careful. He is the commander. We lost A Fu, he won't be able to help you. You will have to go on without him. Received. Commander, there are news. A group of foreigners is approaching. Thing? Who can it be? I have no idea. I mean, were we really supposed to come here? You know him He doesn't want any unfinished business. What do you think awaits us? I've seen them before. We found them at the night club the other night. It is really them. I do n't understand if they are armed. Be careful and keep us informed. Do you know how many there are? They have a lot of bodyguards. I don't see Hong Bing. It does n't seem to be with them. I count eleven men, they just landed. I don't see any women among them, do you? I caught a glimpse of weapons, probably rifles. Hey, Sam, what's on your mind? I'm sure the police know about this place. Oh yes. It will come any moment. Quiet. We will show it to him. Hey, you, put someone on the lookout. But what are you doing? You ask too many questions. Come on, let's go. Here. Sam controls a drug cartel. He arrived on the island with the intention of robbing Hong Bing. In your opinion, can the team do it? When they are together, no one can stop them Don't shoot until we're inside. Liao, get to your station. The three of us go in from there. Wen, on the roof. Yes, sir. The goal is to arrest Hong Bing's gang. But A Fu is in danger, you must do what you can to save him.
