- Happy birthday, Ms. Lin. - Hey. - This looks nice. - Ms. Lin. Yes, take a look. - Hello, Ms. Lin. - Hello. - Hello. - Ms. Lin, buy some fish. - That one looks so fresh. - Yes, it is. - It's still alive. - Yes. - Long time no see. Come take a look. - Ms. Lin. - Get one for your birthday. - Good morning. - Good morning, Ms. Lin. - Good morning. Ms. Lin, come here. - Ms. Lin. - Hey. Today's your big day. Why did you come here yourself? I came to check the goods you delivered to us. Milkfish and shrimps. They're freshly peeled. I don't need those shrimps today. Ten pounds of velvet shrimps instead. They're prepared on the spot to export to Japan. I know. - Give me 40 of them. - Okay. 200 dollars per pound for the velvet shrimp and 600 dollars for the eel. You're my loyal customer. Pick something you like, it's on the house. - How can I do that? - It's fine. - This one then. - Okay. Be careful with it. All right. Gently… It's hot. Breakfast is ready. Okay. The bowls are sparkling clean. Why are you washing them again? What a waste of water. I'm not. Lobster for breakfast? Eat it while it's hot. Isn't this your favorite? Did you go to the fish market this morning? Yes. I went to check what Mr. Hsu delivered to your store. Didn't you agree to let me be in charge today? Just relax, practice your song, go to the salon, dress up nicely, and come to the restaurant at 6 p.m. Are you sure you can handle it? You have to let me try. Grandma. Grandma! - Happy birthday. - Long time no see. You silly girl. Your backpack is wide open. I can't see my back. Are you planning to stay for a week? - Sure. - What? That won't be good for me. Let's go. Goodness. What are you doing? Let's go! Okay. Step down. Very good. Melt. Melt. Catch it. Good. I hope that when you do this move, it's like catching someone who means a lot to you. Because this dance is about love, isn't it? Okay. That's it for today. Same time next week. Don't be late. Thank you. Arms up, the other one, lean your body back, and… Good. Arms down and up again. Five, six, seven, down. One and two and three. Up and four. Up and lean back. Five, six. Based on the current state, the shape and proportion of your face, we will implant this I-shaped nose graft onto the bridge. Then we will take your own cartilage and place it on the tip of the nose. The nose tip will be lifted and your nose length will be extended. - Yes. - It's the most natural way for now. Dr. Chen, your daughter's teacher, insists on speaking to you. - Excuse me. - No problem. Yes, Ms. Chen. I see. Okay, I'll talk to her. I will take care of it. Thank you, Ms. Chen. Ms. Lin, it's your big day today. Thank you. Let's choose a song. But my mom is calling. - Choose the song first. - Okay. "TASTE OF LONELINESS" Youth is bittersweet. Soothing songs need no lyrics. Chug it down. Fear no sorrows. On gloomy sleepless nights Clementine. The drink doesn't taste the same The more you want to finish it. Why drink with me If your heart is elsewhere? Only the moon understands me. If you play a role against your will. DIVORCE AGREEMENT How can the show be good? The past is like clouds. You can't make it go away. Why did you change the menu without asking me? Ms. Lin just told me this morning. Didn't we already agree yesterday? Okay, don't cook first. That's enough. Wait! Shrimp rolls are the top priority. Don't make the eels if there's no time. - But Ms. Lin... - Wait. Get back to work first. Hello, Ms. Tsai. The hospital? Number 9, please go to Counter 4. Thank you. Dad. I brought your favorite, sushi. Jiajia. Everything you get me is delicious. Should we get the doctor? The doctor was here just now. He should be fine. The bed is tiny. Let's go back to the hotel. It's because you're tall. I want to go home. Take me home. Hey. We will be home soon, okay? We will. We will be home soon. We will. I'll get the doctor. Clementine, come sit here. Grandma. Who is he? Her dad. So he was my grandpa? What about Mom's birthday party? Do we cancel it? The whole town would know that something happened if we canceled it. There's no need to cancel it. The birthday party will go on as planned. I had no news from him for over a decade and he gives me trouble when he dies. How can he do that? Welcome. - Happy birthday. - Welcome. Come inside. Mom, let's go inside. Our uncles won't come. How do you know? Mom. - Dad. - Here is my good son-in-law. My apologies. The last patient's surgery took too long. Is it okay that I invited Kuan? Of course. Bring him in. Where is he? - Shoying. - Here you are. Uncle. Shoying, I'm sorry. Our doctors are useless. They let him die in my hospital. But it was so intentional. He chose to die on your birthday and even came back to Tainan. He can't leave us alone even after death. It's all good. I'm very happy that you came today. We can start now since your uncle is here. - Come. - Let's go. Must he speak of him that way? Listen. Regarding joining the hockey team, I will talk to your mom. Okay. Listen. You can call me anytime you want, okay? Dad, who is that person behind you? Chen Wanching? I'll call you back later. Kuan? My goodness. We haven't seen each other for over 20 years, right? Yes, about 20 years. Do you want one? I quit many years ago. You're talking to your young girlfriend? She's my daughter. She moved to Vancouver with her mom many years ago. Her mom is my ex-wife. It's all right. Shoying. I asked our brothers to come. They're becoming more stubborn as they grow older. It's okay. As long as you are here, I'm happy. Yu, Sean, thank your uncle. He has helped you so much. Thank you, Uncle. Don't mention it. Clementine, what grade are you in? Which medical school do you want to study at? I'll recommend some professors for you. We don't know yet. Perhaps we'll send her to study in the States. The States? The grass isn't greener on the other side of the fence. Clementine is the best. Here. Drink with me. Mom, take it easy. Jiajia. Come on. You worked the hardest today. Here. Excuse me. The food is here. Mom, don't drink so much. We should all be happy today. Let me sing a song for you, Shoying. I am a great singer. Mom. - I'll drink with you. - Sure. Happy birthday. Stay young and beautiful. - Thank you. - Ladies and gentlemen. Shrimp rolls are the specialty of my sister's restaurant. It's the best in the city. Give it a try. Seventy years old, that's something. Come, raise your glasses. Let's make a toast to her to wish her a happy birthday. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Cheers. My sister is an extraordinary woman. She's really extraordinary. From a street vendor selling shrimp rolls to a restaurateur, she raised four… No, three daughters on her own. Her daughter is a plastic surgeon in Taipei. Her son-in-law is a famous oncologist in Tainan. Give them a round of applause. Sean, when will you work at Lin General Hospital in Tainan? The Lin family has many doctors. We all cherish our wives. We are very... All right. I'll sing a song for you. Switch to that song. It has been more than a decade. The flowers still won't bloom. Forgive me for being sentimental I really can't accept it. Farewell, the lover who isn't Meant to be for me. Without love, it's in vain. The past is like a fool's story. A lame daydream. Farewell, the lover who isn't Meant to be for me. Jasmines in June are so fragrant I hope that you'd be like Flowers in spring. And bloom so nicely. Grandma, are you not feeling well? Kids should listen and not speak. Don't tell your mom and aunts that we came here, okay? Okay. Excuse me. I am Chen Bochang's wife. Someone took him here, right? Can you tell me who that person was? Hold on. Let me check. Her name is Tsai Meilin. Tsai Meilin. Can I have her phone number? 0958740... Can you say it slowly? -0958 -0958 - 740. - 740. Clementine. Add Ms. Tsai's number to my phone. Are you going to confront her? What's the point of confronting her? She's just another silly woman who was duped by your grandpa. Was Grandpa that kind of person? No wonder Great Uncle speaks badly about him. Thank you. It's November already, and it's still so hot. Wait. I need to talk to you. How much do you need this time? DIVORCE AGREEMENT How much do you owe that you have to marry someone to pay the debt? That's not it. What did I, Lin Shoying, do to deserve a divorce? Our home is like a hotel to you. You come and go anytime you want. I give you money every time you want to do business. No. You didn't do anything wrong. Everyone in Tainan knows I've failed the Lin family. If I continue staying here, I'll be a loser for the rest of my life. Marriage is supposed to be a lifelong promise. Shoying. I really feel apologetic towards you. However, I really can't stay here anymore. Sign it and send it to this address in Taipei. Dad, you're back? Jiajia, you've grown so much. Here. This is for you. Be a good girl, listen to your mom. Dad. Your call will be directed to voicemail. Leave your message after the beep. Otherwise, please hang up. Leave your message after the beep, and please press "#" when you're done. She's smoking again. She didn't even put away the dishes. Just stop by during lunch break. I was thinking of going with you guys. A wake is not fun. I don't want to end up like Kuan. His wife and child are in Canada and he's all alone in Taiwan as an ATM. Don't I earn money in Taipei? I was joking. It's not funny. Did Mr. Chen buy a pre-needed funeral plan? No, he didn't. Mr. Chen's current address is in Taipei. Would you prefer to have the wake and funeral here or in Taipei? Chen Bochang was born and raised in Tainan. Of course we will have them here. Mom. Can we bring Dad home? We don't need Taoist priests. We'll just recite the Buddhist sutra, eat vegetarian food, and transfer the merits of our practice to Dad. Your dad visited Taoist temples often when he was young. Now, you want to convert him to Buddhism? What are you discussing now? Shoying, I told my staff to keep quiet about the friend who took Chen Bochang to the hospital. Do you have to arrange the wake and funeral for him? Let his friend take care of it. Mom, Ms. Tsai… Ms. Tsai told me that Dad's last wish was to come home. CHEN BOCHANG MOURNING HALL I think Chingchaolun has available memorial lots. Putting him in a columbarium after cremation is more convenient. Don't worry. Consider this a debt I owe your dad in my past life. In this lifetime, I will hold an extravagant funeral for him. Grandpa was so handsome. Where did you get that inappropriate picture? Next, Ms. Chen Wanching. Ms. Chen Wanching? Isn't Ms. Chen Wanching here? Next, Ms. Zheng Tao. Do you have your health card? Miss. I don't think smoking is allowed here. What are you doing here? What a coincidence. Did you come to see me? I came to see my brother-in-law. Which body part? Has it been confirmed? It's just a routine checkup. I completed my treatment three years ago. That's why you should quit smoking. But I am very sad. My dad just died. Mr. Chen? Mr. Chen died? When? No. A few days ago, I… Goodness. Where did you go all morning? Nowhere. The funeral is enough trouble. Don't create more problems for me. Mrs. Chen, take care of yourself. I'll get going. Go back to Taipei tomorrow. You can't miss your TOEFL lessons. Just come back a day before the funeral. Why did Grandpa wear sunglasses? To look cool? His eyes were bad, they were sensitive to light. No. He hurt his eyes jumping off a building. When did that happen? Why didn't I know that? You don't know a lot of things. That was before you were born. Dad disappeared again for months. When Mom found him, he jumped out of the window. He broke his leg and hurt his eyes. He deserved it. We were so broke that we had nothing to eat. He was still fooling around with women. You brought a knife. Of course he had to jump. He ended up in the hospital and we had to pay for that. Was it worth it? If your mom didn't keep crying and begging me saying that she'd take responsibility for him, I wouldn't have tried taking him home. So Mom, you did love Grandpa. No. Ten months after your grandpa came home, Jiajia was born. So your grandma was the one who loved your grandpa. Don't be silly. Let's go home. This is so embarrassing. Chen Bochang, open the door. I know you're inside. - Chen Bochang! - Where are you going? Chen Bochang! You heartless scum! You don't have money for your kids, but spend money on women! Don't you dare come home again! - You… - Ma'am. I didn't take his money. I'm sorry. I really didn't take his money. Ms. Lin, please pay your husband's bill. ANNOUNCEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT - Hello? - Hello, Ms. Tsai. Jiajia. My mom still decided to hold it at the funeral home. She won't post an obituary in Taipei either. Please inform Dad's friends in Taipei. Recite the sutra for him so that he can rest in peace. I feel apologetic towards Dad. I wasn't able to fulfill his last wish to come home. Amitābha. Are you Bochang's sister? We studied the sutras with Bochang and Meilin. Thank you for coming. How long have you known Chen Bochang? Bochang just joined us later on. Meilin has been studying with us for over a decade. Over a decade? How long had they been together? Sirs and ma'ams, I'm sorry. I had to do something earlier. No worries, Jiajia. Where is Meilin? Ms. Tsai… Meilin? There is no Meilin here. I am Chen Bochang's wife. - Amitābha. - Amitābha. Sirs and ma'ams, please take a seat. Thank you. We can begin now. "Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, while dwelling in the deep perfection of wisdom, sees that the Five Skandhas are empty, thus free from suffering. Shariputra, form equals emptiness. Emptiness equals form. Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. - "Feelings, actions…" - What's going on? - Ask Jiajia. - "All dharmas are empty. They neither arise nor perish…". Hello, Master? Please come over now. Yes. Is this a battle? My goodness. This is good material. Go straight to TOEFL lessons after school. Don't go elsewhere. I'm going home all alone, I'm so pitiful. All right. Don't worry. I'll ensure she gets on the train safely. She loves to wander. You're not aware. I know that. Stop nagging. Hey! Don't close the door on me. Grandma, what are you planning to do? Nothing. Let's go. But I'm going back to Taipei. Come. Grandma, this place is filled with hotels. They suit your grandpa's taste. What the hell? No one's here, and you keep ringing the bell. Ms. Tsai, I have some questions for you. What? Kids can't drink alcohol. It's an alcohol-free mocktail. Drink it to your heart's content. Our patrons are only looking for someone to talk to to make them feel better. That's all. Meilin never gets involved with men. She's not an easy woman. She was involved with my grandpa. Meilin is a very loyal woman. She and Chen-san have been together for over a decade. And they're on vacation in Tainan now. Chen-san is Grandpa, right? Chen-san is your grandpa? I am so sorry, Mrs. Chen. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Aiko. Did you say they went on a trip to Tainan? Chen-san is from Tainan. They visit the Mazu Temple every year. They visit the Mazu Temple every year? Why haven't I ever run into them? Clementine, let's go. Please tell Ms. Tsai that if she has any issues with Bochang's funeral arrangements, come see me. Chen-san's funeral? My grandpa passed away. - What? - Take your stuff. Mrs. Chen, I'm sorry. Frankly speaking, if Meilin wanted to steal your husband, she doesn't need to wait until he is dead. You will understand when you meet her. Mrs. Chen? You… Yu, do you remember when I secretly went to visit Dad in middle school? Of course. Mom thought you got kidnapped. She even called the police. Back then, I finally got to see Dad. I had so many questions for him, but I never really got my answers. Instead, he asked me about school, about the two of you. Later on, he took me to a cafe. He said the dessert was good there. The jelly candy again? How do you know? - Uncle. - Uncle. Sit down. These are for you. Your mom is so softhearted. She decorated the place so nicely. Where is she? She just went out for a while. Where's your elder sister? I never saw her again after the party. Where did she go? She truly takes after your dad. I feel sorry for your mom. Chen Bochang is finally gone. Now, she has to worry about Ching. What exactly have my dad and Ching done wrong? Do you know why your other uncles refused to attend your mom's birthday party? It's because your grandpa gave a lot of money to your dad to do business back then, yet he disgraced us. - Uncle. - Yes? What's your family name? - Lin. - Then don't worry about the Chen family. Yu, why are you saying that? Actually, I've already let go of the past. To be honest, your mom is the one who's still holding on to it. Remember to drink these. I did find a lump. If we do the biopsy now, the result will be ready in a couple of days. - Is that so? - Yes. I see. Everybody's busy with Dad's funeral lately. I think - we should tell them after it's over. - Ching. Let's start the treatment early. You can count on me, don't worry. Next, Ms. Liu Yi-chun. How were the examination results? You know, the first time I went to Singapore with the dance troupe, it was New Year's Eve. Singapore's east seashore was filled with a long line of ships. During the last second before the new year, all the ships there sounded their horns. Sometimes, I really envy your free spirit. Unlike you, I'm trapped here all day. I told you to stay in Taipei. Why did you come back? If you fail your TOEFL exam, you must go to language classes in the States. How can you focus on your SAT then? Sirs and ma'ams. We're heading back to Taipei. But my dad needs your chanting. This is Meilin's decision. Sirs and ma'ams. Thank you for coming here from Taipei. Buddha's mercy knows no boundaries. It's never too late to repent. I don't have that kind of wisdom. What did you say to Ms. Tsai yesterday? Who? I don't know her. Didn't you go to Taipei with Clementine? Are you part of the patrol team? Why don't you ask Ching where she went yesterday? I was out with Kuan. Yes, you left me and Jiajia here and Uncle lectured us. You can go out too if you want. No one will stop you. If possible, I'd rather go back to work in Taipei. What did your uncle say? The Lin family values don't matter. My surname is also Lin. Why wouldn't it matter? Ms. Huimei told my mom, "Buddha's mercy knows no boundaries. It's never too late to repent." I don't think anyone ever dared to speak to her that way. Practicing Buddhism depends on fate. What's the matter? Ms. Tsai, do you know what happened between my dad and uncle? Every time we come to Tainan, your dad would bring me here. He often told me stories about his days as a policeman. He said that he would visit every household in the neighborhood and chat with them. That really suits his personality. I didn't know that he was once a policeman. This was the dorm he was assigned to when he was a policeman. Your sisters probably don't remember. After he and your mom got married, they lived here for two to three years. They only moved after he resigned. Why did he quit? Being a policeman is good. It was not up to him to decide. That's how my mom is. She won't let you do what you want, then blames you for not doing things well. I wasn't able to give this to you at the hospital that day. Your dad brought it from Taipei. We cordially invite your soul to come home. Please take the offerings with you to the afterlife. Now, sons and daughters, on your knees. Cry out for your dad to come home. Toast and reunite. There's no need to kneel. He didn't raise you. Why do you need to kneel? There's no need to cry either. We cry out because we miss him so that the deceased hear our calling and when he hears our calling, he'll find the way home to us. He's dead. He would know. Fine. Kneel. What's wrong? Something is moving over there. - Where? - Could it be that Grandpa's back? Honey. Don't kill it! Grandma, you're so gross. Don't think you can avoid school by hiding at Grandma's house. But it's the seventh day today. It might be my only chance to meet Grandpa. Then you have to fall asleep before midnight so that grandpa would dare to return. That's superstition. Hello? Why are you calling now? I can't talk right now. Okay. Okay, thank you. Hello? Okay. Okay, I will talk to her. - Honey. - Yes? Whose book is When I Am in Love? What? When I Am in Love. Whose book is it? It's probably Clementine's. I receive packages for her all the time. You need to be on my side in parenting. I can't always play the bad guy. Come. Sit down. We need to talk. Do you want a divorce? You only need to pay for Clementine's education. - Why do you want a divorce? - You mentioned it first. I didn't. Did you meet someone in Taipei? I am not Ching. She's the one I want to talk to you about. What happened to her? Do you fear death? My cancer is back. I have to do it all over again. I must start over again. It will be okay. Are those for Dad? Bring this to the table. No matter how much of a loser your dad was, he won't reincarnate as a cockroach. Mom. What? Why did Dad resign from the police force? The pay was low. But it's a stable job with a tuition subsidy. It was your own decision to skip college and work in the restaurant. I am not blaming you. I'm asking about Dad. - Mom. - Another daughter is here to see her dad. Did Ching come back? No. Why? Sean. - Mom. - Sit down. I'll get the hot sauce for you. Okay. Thank you. Eat. I'll get it. - Jiajia. - Sean. What are you doing? Mom, don't eat expired food. It's bad for you. Who says it's expired? I gave you money for expenses. Why do you eat expired food? You're not the only one who's earning money. Mom is getting old. Her memory is getting worse. - Her vision is getting bad... - So can't you help take care of her? How can I do everything for her? We have enough money, but Jiajia is very busy with the restaurant, you know? You don't come home. You have no idea. Grandma, can I sleep with you tonight? Why? I've never met Grandpa. Even so, he would know that you're his granddaughter. What are you scared of? He won't take you with him. How did he pursue you back then? "Dear Ms. Shoying, it is a lovely day today. A butterfly is dancing in front of me. I hope it brings the warm sunshine to you." It's a love letter. Grandpa had nice handwriting. He was so good at writing. What's the use? All it took was some flattery. They say nice things to him, and he became a guarantor for their loans. What would happen if you become a guarantor? Ask him when you see him. I don't want to. I'm going back to mom. You're such a wimp. When your mom gave birth to you, didn't she give you some guts? Dad would always come when I got a medal in school. Mom seemed happy to see him back then too. So I thought if I kept winning medals, Dad would remember to come home. But eventually, even when I graduated from medical school, Dad never showed up again. Look. Studying was all I did back then. Aside from photos of getting medals, there's nothing else here. Don't be sad. Your daughter doesn't have any photo albums at all. Yes, but she has a one terabyte hard disk of digital photos. Don't act this way, she was my lover in my previous life. That's domestic violence. Sweetie. Look. This is what your dad looked like in college. - Why do you have that photo? - This is the only one. Does it look like me? You were more handsome then. And thinner. You were so skinny. You know, we love you very much. We just want you to be healthy and happy. Then why are you sending me to the States? Pack up and come home tomorrow. Your dad misses you a lot. She misses you a lot. Good night. Yu was looking for you. Okay. Jiajia? Yes. How did Dad look when he passed away? Ms. Tsai was holding his hand. He didn't seem to be in pain. Really? Yes. Can you also hold my hand when I die? What are you talking about? I can't believe you still have this. I made this for you when I was in middle school, right? No. Yu made this. You made this one. It's so ugly. - This one? - Yes. This one? Right. There's no need to interlock our fingers. Just hold it. I will hold it like this. Like this. Goodness. But I'm afraid you'd have too many boyfriends fighting to hold your hand. Listen. Not just boyfriends, but I have many girlfriends too. What would you do? MEMORIAL MEMORIAL CHEN BOCHANG MOURNING HALL CHEN BOCHANG MOURNING HALL Ching. Yu. Why are you in Taiwan? My mom told me that Uncle passed away. Come. Hey, who exactly is she? I don't know. Mom, Mei is here. Aunt. Here. We don't take that. - Please. - No. Take it. How's life in Singapore? Did your husband come with you? Yes. Do you plan to have kids? I am expecting. Then you shouldn't have come here. I am here to see you. Yu, hand me the red thread. Here. She didn't suffer in our family. Her life is better this way. Not really. Yu and I became stronger because of the hardships. The lump we found last time was indeed a tumor. It's about 2 to 3 cm. The biopsy has confirmed that it is malignant. With mastectomy and chemotherapy combined, you could live another five years. So much suffering for only five years. It doesn't seem worth it. Ching, if you're worried about staying in Tainan with your mom, get the treatment in Taipei. I'll contact my classmate at National Taiwan University. Or do you want me to go to Taipei and force you to go to a doctor? Kuan. Kuan Zhen. Mr. Kuan. We haven't seen each other for decades. You really don't need to care about me. It's not your responsibility. I hope that it's my responsibility. Chen Wanching. Kuan, we'll discuss family matters. You should go. - Stay. - He doesn't need to leave. Sit down. All right, what do you want to tell me? I am not signing this. You are both grown-ups. You should talk it over. Divorce is not the easy way out. I sent you the attestation three years ago. Our separation is a hard fact. I don't want a penny from you. What else do you want? I quit my job to take care of you. You dumped me once you recovered. Why? So you want emotional compensation? Fine, give me a number. So since you've got a rich guy now, you want to pay me off? Fine. You really want to do this? Then let's count the times you cheated on me in our ten years of marriage, okay? In the first year, you went to Milan for work and hooked up with a bartender. Giovanni is a friendly guy, he showed me around. In the third year, you and a colleague went to Mt. Yangming for a week. - I couldn't contact you. - It was a spiritual retreat. How can I take any calls? The fourth year. That was amazing. She went boating with a sailor. Since when did you like the sea? I was choreographing a dance about sailing. I need some materials. - On the sixth year... - All right. When you proposed to me, I already warned you that I don't think I can ever settle down. You were the one who said that you'd let me be as free as a kite. "If you are lost in the wind, I will go and find you." That's why I am here, aren't I? That's enough. That's Bobby Chen's song, "Kite." Ching's favorite. Who is Bobby Chen? Both of you need to reach a compromise. Ching. Don't take advantage of people. I take advantage of people? Divorce is the best for us. He just won't let go and wants to torment himself. Ching, you will need me. It's very rare that a man would tolerate you this way. Don't be a drifter like your dad. - When you get to 70 or 80 years old... - I won't live that long! Don't worry about that. Ching. Mother, give this to me. Ching! Mom, stay out of Ching's business. I will never sign this piece of nonsense. Do you want me to recommend a good lawyer? You're still here? Humans are irrational. We know that something is harmful to us, yet we keep doing it. Aren't you the same? I found it! Chen-san is over there. Keep it down. Do you want to scare us to death? This place is full of dead people anyway. Silly woman. Right. Lower your voice. Watch your manners. Mrs. Chen. Ms. Aiko, thank you for coming here from Taipei. Chen-san was very nice to us. It's the least we can do. Besides, we all want to pay tribute to him. - Yes. - Thank you. This is Chen-san's wife. Hi, Mrs. Chen. Hi. Take a seat. - We don't mean to intrude. - No, don't say that. - Mrs. Chen, you must take care. - I will. I am glad you came, Ms. Tsai. Don't make the creases too deep. Open it. Gently. Don't force it. The flower will open up naturally. I'll help fold origami ingots for Mr. Chen. He can use them in the afterlife. Yes, I'll help too. By the way, I still owe him money for three letters. How many do you think I should fold to pay him back? What letter? Mr. Chen would write love letters to our patrons on our behalf. My grandpa was really a master of love letters. You only know that now? By the way, didn't Ms. Tsai come with you? I'm sorry. I suddenly remembered that we have to meet up with some friends. Right. - Mrs. Chen, see you when... - Wait. You can't say that here. Right. Mrs. Chen, we're leaving. I'm sorry. Take care. - Mrs. Chen, take care. - Let's go. Come on. Let me help you. You're useless. You're complaining about the weather. I should have brought an extra coat. Why did it get cold so suddenly? You'll freeze to death wearing that. You sacrifice for fashion. Let's go. Ms. Tsai. All right. We're leaving. Hello? Who is this? Hello? Hello? Ms. Tsai made Mom feel awkward by coming here. Can you stop contacting her? It's because Mom is so fierce that Ms. Tsai can only visit Dad in secret. Couldn't she have informed us before she came? Mom wasn't prepared for it. What does she want? The two of them aren't as affected as both of you. Stop drinking. But French women still have wine when they're pregnant. You are not pregnant. How do you know? Your husband forgot his key? He is on the night shift today. Clementine, who is it? What's the matter? You have a lot to say about me and Ms. Tsai, don't you? Clementine, go to your room first. I don't want to. Why don't you talk it over instead of guessing how Grandma feels? All my life, I worked hard to raise the three of you, yet you all prefer a dad who never contacted you for 20 years. Especially you. I've spoiled you since you were little. From a shrimp rolls stall, I opened a restaurant and gave it to you. Now, all you care about is your dad and Ms. Tsai. What does this have to do with the restaurant? Besides, Ms. Tsai loved Dad. As a woman, can't you understand that? You don't know anything. How can you say that to Mom? Yes, I know nothing - because you never told me. - Stop talking about the past! Dad stole Grandpa's stamp to get a loan at the bank for a business, but the business failed. Grandpa had to sell his clinic to pay off the debt. It was a huge blow to him and he collapsed. That's why our uncles resent Mom and even forbade her from going to Grandpa's funeral. Dad didn't have a choice either. - Back then, the Lin family... - Right. You know your dad the best. You fool around like he did. - That's why you got cancer. - Mom! That does make sense. But don't worry. My karma will come very soon. You can undergo surgery. Why talk about karma? Yu. What are you talking about? - Ching's cancer is back. - Yu. She'll have the surgery after Dad's funeral. I didn't agree to that yet. Why didn't you tell me about this? Do you need to undergo surgery? Do you need to do chemotherapy? Come home. I'll take care of you, okay? See? This is exactly why I didn't tell you. You put a lot of pressure on people, you know? If the surgery fails or I don't survive chemotherapy, it would be like I failed you. All my life, I did so many things for you, but you never thanked me. Fine. Thank you. Of course I can thank you, but I am not Dad. We all know that. I can't apologize for his mistakes. But he's dead now. What you need to do now is let go, okay? I'm so furious. It's useless giving birth to all of you! Mom. Mom. This one is regarding your daughter's health? Yes, thank you. The Yangtze River's winds and waves are calming down. There will be peace now. Someone will come to help. The misfortune will be settled. It is a clear message from Mazu to you. The difficulties will slowly pass. And someone will come to help you. Everything will be fine. There's no need to worry. Thank you. What is the second one for? - I am looking for a person. - I see. Number 9. SERVING THE PEOPLE SERVING THE PEOPLE Dragons and tigers are together in the deep mountains. Why is there a need to look back? You seem amorous, yet soon you will sever all ties. This is saying that you don't need to be anxious in finding the person now. Impatience and obsession may not bring about a good result. Looking back, perhaps it would just be a waste of effort. Ms. Lin, I intruded on you when I went to light an incense the other day. I'm really sorry. Don't say that. Your friends are all very nice. It's a blessing that all of you take care of each other. This temple is far from the city. Why did you come here to worship? Since I met him over a decade ago, he always talked about coming back to Tainan. But due to what happened with your dad, he never dared to return. His health had gotten worse in recent years. He was afraid that if he didn't come back, he'd never get the chance again. He told you about what happened with my dad? Yes. It took him a long time to finally tell me. What did he say? He said that he took the loan for you, the kids, and his own dignity. He wanted to take a risk to see if he could turn the situation around, so he used your dad's stamp without his permission. He also said that he was sorry that he put you in a difficult position with your family. When I think about the pain you experienced for not being able to attend your dad's funeral, I can understand why you can't forgive him. That's not it. He also said that he knows how much you wanted to get back the daughter you gave away. He wondered if she's doing well. GOD OF LOVE Every time we came here, he insisted on worshiping the God of Love. I really don't know what he was thinking. I guess we don't need the God's blessing anymore. Ms. Tsai. I understand if you resent me for not divorcing him. This is fate. If he hadn't met you first, we probably wouldn't have had the chance to be together. WENCHANG DIJUN WENCHANG DIJUN Where did you go, Grandma? To the temple. Your dad left some gold for you. I also saved some all these years. I've already divided them. If you want to write a eulogy, there is one thing you need to know. I was the one… who stole your grandpa's stamp. Mom. But Uncle always said that it was Dad. Your grandpa didn't want our family members to hate me, so he said it was your dad. But your eldest and second uncles still severed their ties with me because of what happened. Your youngest uncle slowly started to contact us again because you studied well and went to medical school like him. Now that I already told you, I don't owe your dad anymore. All right. Get your share and let's go to bed. Here. Why are you doing this? Keep those for yourself. Don't bottle everything up inside. That's very hard. Let the lawyer handle the divorce process. Take care of yourself. Live each day happily, all right? Take this. Give Mei's share to her for me too. Okay. I nag about the restaurant, but you are the owner now. I'm glad that you're taking care of me, but you must know that I'll be gone someday. Find someone to share your life with. Here. Clementine, this is for you. Your mom insists on sending you overseas for your studies. I can't stop her. But I'll miss you a lot. Here. I don't want to go to the States. Let's talk about it at home. You won't let me talk about it when we get home. I mean it. I want to stay. If you stay, your life would just be composed of school, marriage, and kids. You have more options overseas. You've decided for me to go overseas. You're not giving me any options. Don't force her. I didn't push you to study when you were a kid, right? As if. You always told me to listen to Uncle and be a doctor. I was his trophy to our relatives. You make good money being a doctor now. I didn't become a doctor for money. Mom. I don't mind studying in the States. I just want to be with you and Dad and Grandma. Your mom is just like me when I was young. She's very difficult to deal with. Give this to her. To be fair, you pick first. It's the same no matter who picks first. Yours is bigger. Ching. Who is Mei? He Chingmei. The lady who came alone the other day. The day the He family came to pick her up, Mom wouldn't come out of her room. So she is… She is… your third sister. That was Mom and Dad's decision back then. Why don't I know anything about our family? I didn't know all of it either. Mom didn't tell the two of you because she wanted to protect you. Ching. Give mine to Mei. You can give it to her yourself when you meet someday. And this one too. And mine too. Dad brought it from Taipei. My goodness. This is the only trick Dad knows. Come on. Yu. I already brushed my teeth. Why are you acting this way? - What are you doing? - You're so like Mom. What are you doing? Have some. It's so rebellious to eat sweets before bed and not brush your teeth, right? You look so ugly when you eat. Super ugly. Look at that. Here. I want to eat mooncakes. You're lucky to get to eat pomelo. Take a look. This is the reflection of the moon in the water. If you wash your face with this, you will be as pretty as the moon. Mom, wash your face with this. Thank you. Your mom is a natural beauty. Her skin is fair and soft. If she becomes even prettier, even the moon would envy her. You're so silly. Ching, look. Do you see your reflection? - Yes. - Is it pretty? Of course. Why are you so cute? You're even wearing that. - Try it on. - No. Try it on. Try it on. Where are you going so early in the morning? Don't worry. Ching. Are you preparing to undergo surgery? Do you need to have chemotherapy? Sean said that this side must be removed. Didn't I tell you that no matter what happens, - we're all here to help you? - I know. Live each day happily. You should do the same. You must live to a hundred. DIVORCE AGREEMENT LIN SHOYING Grandma, Dad's car is here. Okay. Take these. Take these to your mom. Tell her to cremate these together with your grandpa. Who changed Dad's photo? Mrs. Chen instructed us to do so. Where's Mom? She should already be here. - She said she would get a car herself? - Yes. Where is she then? Youth is bittersweet. Soothing songs need no lyrics. Chug it down. Fear no sorrow. Offer the incense. On gloomy sleepless nights. - The drink doesn't taste the same. - Offer the incense again. Why drink with me If your heart is elsewhere? - Bow. - Only the moon understands me. - Bow again. - If you play a role against your will. - Bow to each other. - How can the show be good? - Please return to your seat. - The past is like clouds. You can't make it go away. - Three bows to your husband. - How do I finish singing. A helpless song? Please fill up my glass with loneliness. Offer the incense again. Offer the incense again. Youth is bittersweet. There is no end to my wandering. Fear no death wherever I go. Fear no sorrow. If you play a role against your will. How can the show be good? - The past is like clouds. - You can't make it go away. How do I finish singing. A helpless song? I don't want a full glass of loneliness. - Youth is bittersweet. - Youth is bittersweet. - Seasons fade away with the wind. - Seasons fade away with the wind. Tears fall as the clear breeze blows. Flowers are fragrant Whether they blossom or wither. - Tears fall as the clear breeze blows. - Tears fall as the clear breeze blows. - Flowers are fragrant. - Flowers are fragrant. - Whether they blossom or wither. - Whether they blossom or wither. - Tears fall as the clear breeze blows. - Tears fall as the clear breeze blows. - Flowers are fragrant. - Flowers are fragrant. - Whether they blossom or wither. - Whether they blossom or wither. - Tears fall as the clear breeze blows. - Tears fall as the clear breeze blows. - Flowers are fragrant. - Flowers are fragrant. - Whether they blossom or wither. - Whether they blossom or wither. Tears fall as the clear breeze blows. Flowers are fragrant Whether they blossom or wither. Tears fall. As the clear breeze blows.
