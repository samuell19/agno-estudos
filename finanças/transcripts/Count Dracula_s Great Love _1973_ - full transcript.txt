You should be more careful, he warned us it was very fragile. To hell with that, it's as heavy as a dead man. You're right. I'd like to know what's inside that's so heavy. I really don't care. They've paid us very well to bring the box here and that's enough for me. He said not to unpack it, and leave it in the cellar. It won't be easy getting it down there. It's stupid to keep going, these hallways'll never end. Let's leave it in this room. Did you notice the look on that man who gave us the job? - Gave me chills. - I barely noticed, it was too late and I was only interested in the money. I assure you I'd never seen a bundle like that. Barton from the station told me he's an English aristocrat. He's a very rich man. He's a doctor. He's bought the sanitarium and it seems he's going to open it again. That stinking Barton, always so well informed. There could be valuable scientific instruments in here, don't you think? That means money. He told us not to open it and looked like he was serious. Come on, let's go. - We've already finished our job. - Why don't we open it, and see what's inside. - Let's go. - Don't worry, man. - Then we'll close it and none'll know. - Do what you want. We better leave right now, I don't like this. Come on, let's open it. Rich people bury their dead loaded with jewels. As if they're going to need them in hell. We ain't lucky, my friend. It's just an old skeleton. Why don't we take a look around the house? The Englishman won't be here for a few more days. Maybe this job will turn out to be more lucrative than we thought. We'll just take a look around, tomorrow we can come back. Forcing the door no one will ever suspect us. But... what about the coffin? We have to leave it as we found it. Come on, don't worry, we'll be back tomorrow. It's useless Lajos, there's only dirt and garbage here. We're passing the place where, according to regional legends, Jonathan Harker and Dr. Van Helsing finally destroyed the king of the vampires. Count Dracula. According to the legend he was a descendant of a great historical figure. A blood thirsty prince that fought the Turks in 1445. We'll see soon the ruins of the castle. They're very close to the city. This is Borgo Pass. Don't always try to scare us, The vampire is just a legend from your country. Listen to me, my friends. This is a region in which everything is possible. I can assure you that Count Dracula existed. What's more, I wouldn't dare deny that he still exists. - Come Imre, don't frighten us. - And if he shows up right now? - I'm scared now. - You can't be serious. Very serious. That old house you see there is an abandoned sanatorium, it was built in 1860. Just like the rest of the area, has a bad reputation, - the patients died in strange ways. - What do you mean by that? Anemia, anemia that spread like an epidemic. Its director, one Yorga Kardos, was finally accused of causing the death of his patients by bloodletting. They say he used it in his experiments. - What did they do to him? - There was a riot. One day the people attacked the sanitorium and hung the doctor. But the following morning his body had disappeared, and it was never found. - And the sanatorium? - It was abandoned. Latest rumor is it was bought by an English doctor. That's what I was told in Bistritz where I'd the pleasure of meeting you. That Englishman must be an eccentric. With the bad reputation of this place it will be very difficult for him to find clients. You've impressed me Imre. I'll have many tales to tell when I return to Munich. - What happened? - We've lost a wheel. We've got to find it, it can't be too far. - I'll go look for it. - I'll go with you. - Damn it, it's going to be dark soon. - Will we have to be here long? At least two hours, and that's if we're lucky. But we can't spend the night here! Don't worry Karen, everything will be alright. There's no trace of the wheel. It has to be around here, it couldn't have gone so far. Maybe it went off the road, we should look in the trees. Ok, let's go. Keep still, keep still! Keep still, keep still! Oh my God! - He's dead! - It's horrible. It's like he had a premonition. He didn't want us to come to this place. We can't leave him here, let's try to get him into the stagecoach. Careful. Poor thing. What are we going to do now? It's useless, we better go back. This is the first moment since we left that we can be alone. You're crazy. It's getting late. They're waiting for us. I don't care about anything else. How long will we keep hiding? Sooner or later they'll find out, but first I want to tease you. Why they haven't returned yet? I'm worried, something must have happened to them. You think so? I think our young friend is very interested in Marlene, and she's interested too. Did you notice how quickly she offered to help him? What an imagination you have. I don't know how you always think the worst of everyone else. Look, here they come! And empty handed. It's about time, what happened? - Not a trace of the wheel. - That doesn't matter anymore, something terrible has happened. One of the horses killed the coachman. It's horrible, what can we do? The storm will be here in a few minutes. There's no choice but to get to the sanatorium, perhaps they can help us. And leave this poor man's body by itself? We can't do anything for him anymore. We should have stayed inside the stagecoach. After what Imre told us I'm scared. Nonsense, that happened a long time ago. We might not find anyone. Maybe Imre knows something else. Imre, if you don't mind we'd like you to keep telling us things about that sanatorium. I've told you practically everything I know. The sanatorium has been abandoned for 10 years. In its time was one of the most luxurious in the country, ...a real palace. And it had the latest advances, both in the facilities and the instruments. That maybe the reason why that English doctor bought it. It's possible, but I don't think he'll have much success. - And what's that man like? - I don't know. He was in Bistritz a few days but very few people saw him. I understand he's very rich and plans to dedicate himself to clinical research. There's no doubt he has to be a lonely man to live in this place. - I'd prefer he hasn't arrived yet. - Don't say that. We wouldn't want to find the sanatorium closed, and then have to sleep outside. We'll know soon enough. Looks like it's abandoned, and it couldn't be more scary. - I think we better go back. - Don't be so fearful, I'm sure that man Imre talked about is already here. I wouldn't be surprised if he was a real Prince Charming. What else would you want? You bet I would. At least he wouldn't take me looking for wheels. It seems there is no one inside. Forgive our intrusion at this hour, but we've had a terrible accident and we need help. I'll be glad to help you. I'm Dr. Wendell Marlowe. Come on in. Allow me to introduce us. These ladies are Karen, Senta, Elke and Marlene. My name is Imre Foldi. I'm from this region. I had the pleasure of knowing my companions in Bistritz and we decided to go for a tour together. But unfortunately our stagecoach had an accident. And one of the horses killed the coachman Perhaps Mr. Marlowe has a cart that we could use to return to Bistritz. I'd like to be able to help you, but sadly I don't have any means of transportation. Do you know any place we can spend the night? It's so late. You shouldn't worry, if you accept, you may be my guests. Within a week the man who brings my supplies will be here. - You could go with him. - A week? That's a very long time. If we stay for a week, it would be an awfully big complication for you. Is there any other hotel where we can stay? I'm afraid not. In any case, it's no bother. And what will we do with the coachman? We can't leave him like that. Don't worry. For the moment I'll try make you comfortable. Later I'll try to bring the coachman's body here. Do you think you could repair the stagecoach, Mr. Foldi? I fear that I'd be unable to do it alone. And besides, the horses escaped. I don't think I could be useful, I'm terrible at these things. I can only repeat my offer already made. This isn't very comfortable, but at least you'll have a roof to protect you. You're very kind, Mr. Marlowe. We'll accept your hospitality tonight. It would be a pleasure to have you as guests as long as necessary. The only thing I'm sorry about is I can't offer you better accommodations. Those are wolves. There are still a few in the region and at night they come down from the hills. Thank God we don't have to spend the night outside. As you can see it's a bit rundown. I've tried to fix it but I haven't found workers willing to come. Because of the sanatorium's story? Imre has told us something about it. Exactly. They say this place is cursed. I'll have to bring them from Budapest. But, you don't have to worry. I've repaired some bedrooms and I hope you don't find them too uncomfortable. - I'm afraid. - Be quiet please, he'll hear you. You're very kind. One could almost say that... you knew of our arrival. In such a remote place, hospitality is necessary. I imagine you're hungry. I've already had dinner. My pantry is modest. But I'll prepare something for you. I don't know what you think but I don't like this place. Of course, this place is very baleful. You heard him, there's no other place nearby. Please, what's with those faces? I don't think the doctor looks like a vampire, or any other of those other sinister characters. I'd say he's very attractive. I definitely like the doctor, I find him quite interesting. I really don't share your tastes, I prefer men tall and thinner. I don't, I like strong men. Did you see the back on him? Besides, apart from Imre who only has eyes for Marlene... You're just like in college, only thinking of men. You'd do it with a broom as long as it wore pants. And you're puritan as always. Please, blow out the candles, will you? I'm falling asleep. I'm scared, something tells me we shouldn't stay long in this house. Don't be silly. You're just scared because of Imre's stories and the coachman's death. Dr. Marlowe seems like a trustworthy person. I don't know, there's something strange here, something floating in the air. Just thinking I have to sleep alone... I'm scared Marlene, stay with me, please. Come Elke, there's only one bed here. And a dirty mattress. We'd be very uncomfortable. As you wish. Rest well. - Karen! What happened to her? - Don't be alarmed. I found her in the hall, something must have scared her and she fainted. - Karen... - A man... A horrible man was staring at me. He was in the hall behind a pillar. I don't remember anything else. It must have been a tramp. When the sanatorium was abandoned they would take shelter in it. How is she Doctor? Her pulse is going back to normal. Calm yourself, no one will enter the house. I'm very grateful for all you've done for me, Dr. Marlowe. I didn't do anything of importance. If you don't mind, I have to go now. Have a good night's rest. Thank you very much, Dr. Marlowe. Don't be upset Karen, he's right. It must have been a tramp. Of course, but he gave me quite a fright. It's from our host. He excuses himself for not spending the day with us. - And for the meager breakfast. - And does it say why he left? It seems he's a hunting enthusiast. He says he went out to check the traps. Perhaps to see if some tourist fell in one. It wouldn't be surprising. I think one has been trapped already. I think we must fix the stagecoach, try to recover the horses and leave. We can't leave without saying goodbye, he's been very kind. He also says he expects to see us tonight. Another reason for us to stay. You can't imagine how scared I was last night. I had to sleep alone... I think you were the only one. - It's wonderful. I've never seen something so beautiful. Who would imagine finding something like this? - Isn't it awful cold? - No, it's delicious! Why don't you come with us? - Come on in for a swim! - Is it as deep as you? No, you can see it's not, silly. - Come on, get in! - You're going to get me all wet! If our host showed up now... You know, I'm glad all this happened. We'll be together for a whole week. I'd like it to be forever. If you want, that could be so. No Imre, we'll have to separate when we return to Bistritz. Forever? Who knows... It's not really what I want that counts. I have to go back home. I don't know what my parents have decided. But let's not talk about that, it makes me sad. You're right. We still have a whole week ahead of us. And will be unforgettable. I promise you. I don't think we should be doing this. Dr. Marlowe might get upset. Nonsense, he's so kind and handsome. I'm sure being so enigmatic, he has something to hide. I don't know what you see in that man. I don't see anything, I simply like him. Stop this silliness, it would be better to go for a walk in the woods. Don't even dream it. We should take advantage of being alone to search the house. We should give Imre and Marlene some time alone, poor things are so in love. It's just like all the others, old furniture and spiderwebs. You must be satisfied now, let's go please. No, we might have something more interesting to find. I don't know what you mean. What we've seen isn't interesting at all. Why don't we go down to the cellar? There's nothing but garbage up here. There'll be rats or even worse things! I'm very scared! Always the same. Don't worry, we'll defend you. What did I tell you? I'm sure his secrets are behind this door. Don't insist, you won't be able to open it. If there's any secret in here, it's well guarded. - Leave it, let's go back upstairs. - Yes, we better go. It's our last opportunity to be indiscrete. We've finally found something interesting. Go on Elke, take a look, you're going to like it. - What is it? - You'll soon see. This is magnificent, a library! Nothing interesting, just old books on medicine. Look at this. "The Memoirs of Professor Van Helsing" Looks like someone has been reading it lately. - The bookmark's still there. - Let's see. Now I'm sure. Dracula has returned. We weren't able to destroy him in Borgo Pass, and his terrible power will once again manifest itself for Dracula is immortal. - What's wrong? - I'm sorry, I can't keep reading. Come woman, you can't believe that nonsense! I'll continue. ...for Dracula is immortal, he's the demon of sadism, the beast that follows man wherever he may go. We may destroy his mortal shell, but the perverse force that resides within him will reincarnate. Once again bringing terror and anguish to us all... ...to all of humanity. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Shall I go on? - Stop, it's making me nervous. No, no, continue. I also fear that his cruel daughter Radna will also return. It tortures me to think what his new incarnation might be, his new appearance. How will we recognize him? And even if we managed to destroy him once again, a new Dracula would rise from his ashes. And so every generation would know him in a new form, a thousand times more perverse than the previous one. Wherever man sheds the blood of his brother, Dracula will return, to punish horror with horror. That coward Elke is afraid to sleep alone. Anyway, it's my turn to sleep on that mattress. Give her company, she needs it, she's awfully frightened. See you in the morning. Senta... The doctor still isn't back and... I don't think he's hunting at these hours. It's very late. He'll be back soon. We shouldn't be worried, surely nothing has happened to him. - Good night. - Good night. Dracula is immortal, he's the Prince of Darkness. We can only destroy his mortal shell. Each and every time he will rise from the ashes. And each new life will surpass in horror the one before. A slight hope lightens my heart. The prince of evil will not acquire all of his malefic power, until he encounters a virgin... ...that falls in love with the vampire in a natural way. Giving herself without him employing his diabolical powers. Then shall the woman's blood return his evil grandeur. And his new vitality will revive his daughter Radna. I pray that that woman... shall never be born. - Good evening, Miss. - Doctor. Something wrong? I didn't expect to find you, when did you return? Only a moment ago. Did you want something? I'm thirsty. I just can't sleep. How was your hunting day? Not so good. If you can't sleep, we could go for a walk if you like. It's a beautiful night, and there's a full moon. A walk in the moonlight? Doesn't that sound too... romantic? Ok, you convinced me. It's a shame that such a beautiful house is so abandoned. It's truly extraordinary to find something like this in the middle of nowhere. My predecessor must have been a surprising man, and passionate about art. He brought Arabian artisans from Turkey to decorate the garden. - Is it true what they say about him? - What do you mean? His passion for blood. Imre told us about a sinister character... ...Count Dracula. Some say that Count Dracula and Dr. Kardos were the same person. I don't know how what to tell you. But you mustn't trust what the farmers say. This region is rich in legends. If Dr. Kardos went beyond the boundaries in his experiments, it's possible that ignorance and superstition did the rest. Then you don't believe in vampires? I didn't say that. There are questions for which science has no answer. Life and death are just one of them. But as a scientist, you must have a formed opinion. No, the true man of science rarely affirms anything. I'd say he doubts everything. I don't understand, do you believe the legend could be true? Why not? Most myths have an authentic origin. The search for immortality is one of great desires of mankind. If the legend is true... ...then the price to be paid is too high. It's terrible. Of course, the price is horror and eternal loneliness. I don't want to intrude in your private life, but I don't understand what made you move here. I'm simply a reserved man. I enjoy the country and tranquility. Do you plan to reopen the sanatorium, Dr. Marlowe? That was my intention at first, but I'm afraid it won't be that easy. The truth is that it doesn't worry me much. I don't want to offend you, but.. You seem even stranger to me than your predecessor. - Will you leave us again tomorrow? - I'm afraid so. I have to check the traps daily, is a job that requires my attention. - And do you hunt often? - Regularly. Have you noticed? The plants around here are very peculiar. Some plants are poisonous, but medicinal too. I often collect them. Do you plan of making a love potion with them? I've... in truth, I've never been in love. Forgive me, I'm being very indiscrete. It was only a joke. What you say isn't so strange. You live so alone and in such a remote place. Perhaps that's the reason... ...your arrival has been a great joy to me. Do you mind if we go back? I feel a bit cold. As you wish. - This garden is beautiful. - Yes. It seems you've became a fan of vampire stories. - It's a very interesting book. - Really? You're making me nervous, leave the books and let's go for a walk. By the way, where is Imre and Marlene? - They're not in their rooms. - It's very strange. Not strange, they're probably out for a walk somewhere. They're in love and it's logical. We won't see our host today as well? He's busy with his work and the house. If I see him tonight, he'll forget about all that. - Forget about what? - The house, woman, the house. I don't know what you see in that man. There is something mysterious about him that attracts me. Well not me. Let's go, maybe we'll find Imre and Marlene. And maybe your mysterious Dr. Marlowe too. Once in a while Elke, you have some good ideas. - Shall we? - Let's go. I thought we were going to have a wonderful day, - but Imre and Marlene ruined it. - It's like the earth swallowed them up. We've looked for them all day and nothing. I'm scared something might have happened to them. We should return. After looking for them all day they might be waiting for us in the sanatorium. You're right. Besides, it's getting very late. Let's take a shortcut through the woods. Senta, what's wrong? - I can't move, my foot, it hurts! - Don't move. It's one of Wendell's traps. Hold still, I'm trying to open it. Lift your foot carefully. - Does it hurt? - A little, but I think I can walk. Let's go back to the road, it's much safer. I was worried, I just arrived and when I didn't see you-- Senta caught her leg in one of your traps, Dr. Marlowe. I'm sorry, it's all my fault. Please, forgive me. Does it hurt? - A bit - Let's go inside, I'll treat you. Have Imre and Marlene returned, Dr. Marlowe? No, I haven't seen them all day. I thought they were with you. They must have gone too far, and they're probably lost in the forest. We'll worry about that later. Maybe they'll find their way back. Let's go inside. Would you finish cleaning the wound, Ms. Karen? I'm going for some disinfectant. Poor Wendell, your accident has upset him. He must be a very sensitive man. That doesn't make sense. That's his profession, right? Will you be quiet? He might return at any moment. I'm afraid it's going to sting. Oh, that does sting. You have no idea how sorry I am for what happened. Don't worry. - Is it serious? - Not at all. Tomorrow it'll be fine. Her ankle is swollen because of the walking. What she needs is a lot of rest. It won't be easy sleeping on that mattress. I couldn't sleep a wink the other night. Don't worry, you can sleep in my room, I'll stay with Elke. You're an angel. - Now you should go to rest. - But we can't do that. - We have to wait for Imre and Marlene. - Don't worry, I'll wait for them. - But- - They'll be back, you'll see. Go rest. Goodnight Wendell, and thanks for everything. It's the least I could do. Goodnight. Goodnight. Wendell. The Prince of Darkness... ...will not acquire all of his malefic power... ...until he finds a virgin... ...that falls in love with the vampire in a natural way... ...giving herself to him... ...without employing his diabolical powers. Wendell, what's wrong? I don't understand. Or perhaps I do. I've let you down, right? Is it so important to you that I've been with other men? We shouldn't have done this. Love is more than a game. At least for me. - You're in love - No... - It's not that. - You are! I beg you, please... Don't leave me like this. Stay. You see? You're thinking about her right now. Wendell... Wendell, come here! It was Imre, that monster was Imre. He's dead, there's no reason to fear. Then those vampire stories are true. Someone must have converted Imre into that monstrous being and if that's the case the same thing happened to Senta, Marlene and Elke. Please, calm down. We have to find them, what happened to them? We'll find them. They're not here. Imre or some other monster must have killed them. There must be another vampire. Perhaps they hid in another room. We must keep looking. It's useless Wendell, I'm sure they're dead. How could you've lived so long in a place like this? I never suspected something like this. We have to get out of here as soon as possible. Not without knowing what happened to my friends. Wendell, it's horrible. It's him Wendell, the one I saw in the hallway, he's responsible for all this! Dracus! No, no, Karen, you can't die! What will happen to me? I need you. Here, take this, it'll make you feel better. And stop worrying. None will hurt us again. My friends, where are they? I'm sorry Karen, there's no sign of them, they've vanished. Maybe it's for the best. We have to leave. Please, Wendell, let's leave this place. Calm down, don't say that, you have nothing to fear. I won't leave your side. You'll soon be well, then we'll leave. I don't know what I'd have done without you these last few days by your side. They've been the most terrible, and then at the same time the happiest days of my life. There's something I haven't told you. Karen, I... You don't have to say anything. Sometimes actions are more descriptive than words. I know you love me. I've known it since the night we took that walk together. And because all the things you have done for me. You don't have to be grateful to me for that, Karen. It's something more than that. It's not only gratefulness. I love you too. Karen... I'm the happiest man on earth. I'm very happy Karen. You are completely recovered. We can leave tomorrow. Yes, dear. There's just one thing that keeps me from being completely happy. I find it impossible to forget about my friends. We spent the best years of our youth in college. I can't resign myself of having lost them forever. I understand Karen, it's hard to lose our loved ones. I don't know... It's possible they're still alive. Maybe they escaped when they saw something was happening, But whatever the case, they're not in the sanatorium. You're right, Wendell. Maybe some day we'll know what happened to them. Alright, we'll leave tomorrow. Karen, you should drink this. It'll do you good, a good night sleep. I don't want to sleep. Wendell... Wendell, where are you? Wendell... Karen... Karen... Karen... Karen... Karen... Karen... You once belonged to Dracula... ...and you must return again... ...to complete the ceremony of the rebirth of his bloodline. And your blood, which until now has been forbidden... ...shall be his nourishment. In this manner... ...you shall be united forever to the Prince of the Darkness. My daughter Radna must come back to life... ...in the next full moon. And Countess Dracula shall return. We shall once again be infinitely powerful, and the world will once again know the empire of shadows. Now it is necessary the ceremony continues... ...that your blood flow without pain... ...and unites you with Dracula. There's nothing to fear, your life will not be in danger. Because the power of darkness... ...goes beyond death. But first you will be Dracula's prisoner... ...until the final ceremony has been completed. Lord... lord! Help me! Help me, lord! Please sir, help me. My foot is caught. I can't move. No, no, no, no! Come Helga, hurry up, it's going to be dark soon. Leave my daughter alone! You won't take my daughter! You must come with me. Soon we will be united forever. No one will separate us. For you, Dracula has been a different being during this time. For you he has recovered the human condition he has lost centuries ago. But no one can escape his destiny. Dracula shall always be horror and loneliness. It's you who must exchange your condition for his, if you truly love him. The ceremony must continue. The triumph of the Kingdom of the Shadows demands the suffering and torture of an innocent. Later, the blood of the woman that loves the Prince of Darkness and of the virgin that's been tortured... ...shall combine to create a new physical shell for Radna. Satan's breath is with us. When the moon rises again, and you, Karen, of your own will... ...receive our stigma, the ceremony will be complete, and Countess Dracula will come back to life. Help! Help me! Help! It isn't the first time a vampire loves one of the daughters of men. I love you and can't force you to share my destiny. For your love, I'll renounce resurrecting my daughter Radna. For the first time the love of a woman alters Dracula's destiny. The daughter of darkness must wait for her awakening. But her body must be sheltered from the mortal man. No, you don't need to defend yourself. You have nothing to fear. Everyone including Radna has disappeared. We're alone... ...and once again Dracula asks you to share his destiny. You have served Dracula. Now you will return to your original form. Dracula needs you no longer. For the last time I ask you, that you renounce your mortal existence. And become one with me. I can't. For the first time love brings a finish to the life of Dracula. Ka... Ka... Karen... Come back, my love. Come back, my love.
