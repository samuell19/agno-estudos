No, just--just not-- not--not today. No! No! Get up! [shouts, sobs] Help me! shut up! (Jethro) You get in there, you faggot man! (man) Communication... is the key. By that I just don't mean communicating with each other. I mean communication with your inner self. In this room you can express yourself in a safe environment. so... Lewis. This is your chance. Externalize your anger. Understand it, and you control it. I'm not angry. Lewis? Are you sure? Lewis? (Callum) Fuck's sake! Callum, would you like to share your anger? Look, I know this can be a little bit intimidating at the start, but once you get over the first hurdle, you'll realize-- Anger. [chuckles, chatter] (Blue) Shut up, man. (Jethro) Oi, Lindsay. Looking for Davie, batty man? (Blue) Batty boy! [door unlocks] (Davie) No! Get away! (Lindsay) Davie, it's me, man, let me in, Steve's coming! [door closes] (Steve) Oi! Where are they?! (Blue) Who's that then, Steve? You know who. I don't know what you're talking about, steve. (Jethro) Steve, leave him! We all get in shit if you cause trouble, so forget about it. (Lewis) speak! Perfect! Two little cocksucking rat bastards together. How funny is it now? Not funny at all, steve. steve, don't. Please. Just leave us alone. I don't know about you, Lewis, but I feel like taking a piss. I thought we were gonna do this... Oh, yeah. (Lewis) Yeah, I'm really bursting. No, don't! No! (Lewis) No you don't. [sobbing] Why can't you just be a man about it, eh, Davie? Take what's coming to you. You're such a little faggot. I bet you're slipping it to your little chum here, right? Now, boys... [belts unbuckle, zippers open] Now... Drink up! [peeing] [sobbing, moaning] Warden! Warden! You know they're gonna blame us for this, innit? shit always rolls downhill, man. Trust me here. They're coming our way, you know. Fresh and steaming. Who'd notice on you, Jethro? What the fuck are you saying, steve? You've got to learn to take a joke, mate. You brothers are so sensitive. (Jethro) One of these days, I'm gonna beat the shit-- What? Come on, then. (guard) Right! By your beds. Governor's here. Jethro, put that down. You can't even fucking read! sir! Er...This was his dorm. Which was his? That bed there, sir. You. Did you know David? Then get off his bed! Now! Did any of you know him? Why didn't you try to help him or stop him? We were sleeping. We didn't know. Didn't know? That he was dying right beside you all? What's your name? Lindsay, sir. I know what all of you did. You should be ashamed. And so should you! Get them out of here. Get them to the island. And teach then a bloody lesson! Yes, sir. Fucking brilliant. Do you reckon we can get some pizza delivered? steve, give me that phone. [chuckles] Joking, man. (Jed) Right, guys. Get your kit, let's get moving. Tragic, man, tragic. (Jed) Keep up, Callum! (Blue) Come on, Callum! (Jethro) I don't see why we can't just camp here. (Blue) You seen the size of that hill? (Jethro) Does anyone even live here? (Jed) No, not anymore. It was a training station for the Army before being handed over to the prison service for the likes of you lot. (Jethro) Are you missing the concrete beneath your feet, bro? (Blue) Well, you know me, bro. It's all about street lamps, pollution, fast food, and Dixie fried chicken, you get me? All that shit. (Jethro) straight up, Blue. (Lewis) Deep-pan pizza. (Lindsay) Oh, yeah, KFC. (Blue) shut up, man. Just walk, man. (steve) What the fuck are we doing here? (Jed) Building character, lads. [all laugh] (steve) Character. [wood creaking] Uninhabited...right? (Blue) There's a tree. There's another one. (Jethro) Do these things bite? (Lindsay) I don't think so, no. (Blue) Oh, look, man, another tree. Well. Here we are, lads. Home, sweet home. (Jethro) This is a joke, right? (Blue) This is where we're supposed to stay? Fucking hell. This is dead, man. (Jed) Four tents. One for me, one for the kits, and you can fight over the others yourselves. [groans] [sniffs] (Jed) Callum! [wood creaking] (steve) Yeah, there's some over there, mate. - (Lewis) Where? - (steve) There. Where? I can't see where your finger's pointing. There! Oh, you're fucking useless, mate. Little flying bastards. Look at this shit. I've been bitten all over, man. (Steve) I thought you'd like this jungle life, Jethro. Make you feel right at home. [fake laugh] [claps] You're a flipping comedian, you know that. Fucking clown! (Jed) That's enough. Who wants a lovely morning, steaming cup of tea? (Jethro) Yeah, nice one, Jed. Yeah? I'll tell you what. Callum, go and fill these up from the river, 200 meters straight down there, son. All right? And get a move on! Somebody wake Lindsay up. [wood creaks] Where's my bloody water? (Jethro) Jed, he's over here! Oh, you'll live. What happened? I got hit. Hit? (Blue) someone hit you? (Jed) No, Blue, he just fell over, didn't you? (Callum) No, I got hit. some joker smacked me from behind. Was it you? It was us that found you. Calm down, killer. Where's your sense of team spirit, eh? Are we safe with him here being with us? (Jed) steve, I think we're gonna be alright with lover boy Lewis here to protect you. [chatting, cheers] Whoo! No--no--no-- I don't really like water, man. (all) Come on! Come on, man! Quiet, man. shit. Come on, man. That's it, man. You're nearly there! (Lewis) It's not far! Even fucking Lindsay's done it! (Lewis) Come on, man. Cross to the other bank. That's all. (all) Come on! (Jed) That's it, Blue. Aaaah! [laughter] [indistinct] [shouting, laughing] [laughter, chatter] [shouting, talking] That's what I'm talking about, man! (all) Whoo! Yeah! (Jethro) I swear, I'm the only one getting bitten or something. Just relax. [humming] Boys, boys! Hang on a minute, I'm just gonna have a waz. Wait for me, innit, wait! Whoa. What the fuck is that? Is that a camp site? Boys! (Jed) Hello? (Jethro) You said there was no one else here. (Jed) There bloody well shouldn't be. You sit down, shut up, don't touch anything. (Blue) Look at all this. They got a proper camp. Jeth, see if there's any money in there. (woman) Oi. Who are you? This island's private property. There's no access to the general public. I'm not general public. so I'll ask you again, who are you? Jed Wyler. Moorgate's Young Offenders. Who the fuck are you? Luise Dow, Temple Park. I thought we had the island to ourselves for the week. Yeah, so did l. [footsteps] Found our stalker. Jo? Is this the little prick that you saw? (Lindsay) Get off me! Who the fuck are these? Blue, sit the fuck down, I mean it. Yeah. You all been spying on us? (Steve) No one's been fucking spying on you. Fucking perverts. (Louise) Can I have a word? Yeah. Listen, I don't want your lads anywhere near my girls. They're enough trouble already. Well, I'm not exactly delighted about the situation myself, am l, Louise? I got a couple of drug dealers, a violent sociopath, an armed robber, a murderer, and a serial sex offender. Last thing I want is your girls getting all hot and riled up under the collar, do you get me? Fine, we'll keep 'em totally separate. Good. Then, why don't you pack up your nice, shiny tents and piss off back to the mainland? It's not gonna happen. Right, well. I'll take the, um, north side of the river, you take the south side. Fine. But I think you mean east and west. North's that way. Right. On your feet, lads, we're moving out. Come on, chop-chop. see you later, babe, yeah? Wanker. so what's your name? Jo. And you? Lewis. Lewis. Bye, Jo. Bye, Lewis. (Steve) Are you done? stay on your side of the river, right? Yeah, yeah. You are such a little slut. Go fuck yourself. Right, here we go, boys, munchies. More importantly, jobs. steve, Lew. There's a monastery on our side of the river. I want you to find it. It's actually on the map. Blue and Jethro, I want you to find some high ground in case the weather changes. And Callum and Lindsay, there's a natural harbor on our side of the river. Find it. Wait for me! Piss off! But Jed said you and me! I didn't! I thought you were different. Well, I'm not! I'm just like all the others, so fuck off! (Jethro) So you wanna cross the river? You heard what Jed said, man. But there's girls there, man, what's wrong with you? Girls that are a little too white for me. I don't care about their color, blood. I just care about their gash, you get me? To be honest, bro, I don't think you really stand a chance, man. I mean, look at that chick back at camp, what's-her-name, Jo. she's only making eyes for Lewis. Yeah, but why, Jethro. I mean, I reckon I'm quite buff. Buff? You see them girls? They like the big mans like me, man. I'm big man! Trust me, I'm big. Where it counts. Look, it's not worth it, man. I say we just kick back and chill here, innit? Take in some of that fresh air, Blue. (Steve) Oi, oi. Well, I'm not one to blow me own trumpet, but well done, me. I've got the map. Yeah, I know, but that's the point. I didn't need the map. You did. (Lewis) who the fuck is this guy? Looks like someone left a monk behind. Are you alright, Father? What, did they forget about you, eh? Eh? Come, Lewis! [pants] [laughter] Eh? Fuck him. Now, that's not very holy, is it, Father? Lew. [groans] Take that stick away from me, man. seriously, Blue, why have you got a stick? 'Cause I want a stick, innit? shut your mouth, man. Afternoon, lads. Get lost? Never even tried. What's the point? It's good for you, innit, do something new. It's good for the soul. You'll thank me for it one day. Don't count on it, Jed. Fair enough. You alright, mate? Jesus, fuck. We need to get out of here. Come on, let's get Louise. What are you doing? Come on, let's get Louise. Callum. Up you get, son. I know what this vibe looks like, but I swear-- [tussling] Get the fucking cunt off me! Don't-- - (Jed) stay down! - (Louise) Don't struggle! [tin clinks] A tramp lived here? Yeah. For an uninhabited island, it's getting pretty fucking crowded, innit? You seriously do not think I did this. You sent them two boys down here to find the place, not me! But we never found it, did we, Lew? No, we got lost. Yeah, I fucking know you. You don't know nothing. There's something not right about this. Yeah, too fucking right it's not. I think they look like bite marks. (Jed) Right. Well, this trip is well and truly over. Got a phone? Yeah. Use it, call the mainland. Phone's gone. Maybe we should let the Police decide who's guilty. Maybe you should stop undermining my authority, Louise. How much experience have you actually had with special Unit Youth Prisoners? Me--ten years. Well, not much, to be honest. I served in Basra with the 7th Armoured Brigade because I joined the prison service. so the inmates I'm more used to are your Republican Guard, Fedayin, Taliban types. so, yeah, you're right. I've not had much special Unit Youth experience, but it was all they had. How much experience have you had with dead bodies and how they got that way? Right, who's the joker? Who's got my phone? I'm being serious. Which one of you slags has taken my fucking phone?! We ain't got your phone, man. If we had your phone we'd give it back. Just to get out of this shitty place. I need my phone. (Jed) You fucking know, don't you, son? I ain't fucking got it, right?! And even if I did-- You ain't got the stones to take it off me, have you? You done a head count recently? There's more of us than you. Ngh! Ah! simple question! Have you got the phone, yes or no?! No. No, fucking no. You need to keep a lid on this situation. Right, everyone, listen up. Considering everything's happened today, Louise and the girls are going to stay here with us tonight. [guys cheer] No dicking around, I mean it! so, what's the plan of action, then. Are we leaving? No. Tomorrow we'll go and find the tramp's boat. Take it to the mainland and get some help. so get some food on, eh. The super-noodles are mine, innit? [inaudible] (Jethro) I'm sick of beans. [chatting] [laughter] (Jethro) so, are you enjoying that? It isn't bad. Can you give me the keys to Callum's cuffs? Why? I just wanna give him some food. Unless you want to. Louise, don't be mugged off by Callum. Don't be fooled by him. The thing about that kid, you never know which way he's gonna fly. He's got a list of previous as long as my arm. I'll tell you something. You know when he was 14, he even killed another boy. I know, I was there. Oh, he got away without charge. Maybe he shouldn't have done. I don't know what he's capable of. still want the keys? You're taking a bit of a risk, aren't ya? I'm a stone-cold killer, remember? I don't think so. You don't think I did it, then? I don't think you could do anything to me. Can I smoke a cigarette? Did you kill that lad back in the other institution? What? Jed's told you his favorite story, then? Well, did you? He died. You see that? This lad, Neeson, stuck his craft knife in me. I defended myself, that's all. He stabbed me, but... No way I wanted to kill him. Why would I want to kill him? You know, I don't want to spend all my life inside. These boys, they don't give a shit. They love it. They're never getting out. But me, I'm using this. I've got a plan. You got a plan, eh? Yeah, I have. I keep my head down, and I do this quietly. 'Cos when I get out, there's no foster care, no more care at all. Out of the system. It's just Callum. And I can have one day without doors slamming, without shouting, just silence to think. [panting, heavy breathing] [soft moaning] [Lewis moaning] ssshhh! ssshh, what's that? It's me, it's me. ssshh! [moaning continues] (Lewis) Oh! Oh! [Jo moans] [bird chirps loudly] Yo, Blue, come on, man, wake up. Blue, wake up, it's water duty. (Blue) Well, it don't take two of us, man. Yeah, but Jed said not to go out alone, innit? You're gonna need a crowbar and a winch to get me out of here, 'cause I ain't moving, alright? You're so flipping useless, you, man. Don't even know why I hang around with you in the first place. Shut up! [shouts] Hello, there! [chuckles] Oh, fuck! # Yeah, yeah # [chuckles] [snarling] [roar, snarl] [Jethro screams] (Jed) So you let him go out alone? You, you plank. How many times have I got to tell you things before you actually listen? He's gonna be fine. I mean, what's gonna happen to him? Well, I'll tell you what's gonna happen. You are gonna go and find him. Alright, let me get this straight, yeah. so you want me to go out there alone to find another guy out there alone when no one's supposed to be going out there alone. Yeah, that really makes sense, Jed. Yeah, well. I'll tell you what. Why don't you take your best mate shitty pants with you? [Steve chuckles] Yeah. Take Lindsay for your protection, Blue. No, I'd rather go out alone. Right, don't talk to me, don't walk near me, just walk behind me. Understand? What are you doing, man? That's enough close. I said don't walk next to me, innit? Well, how far? That far? That far! stay away from me, innit? Fucking dickhead, man. shit, it's always me, innit! (Blue) Jethro! Jethro, man! He's not here, is he? Well, he was here, look. Look, man, just keep looking, innit. Jethro, man! Come on, cuz, where are you? Come on, cuz! Jethro! Look. Why'd you think he'd run off? Do you think something bad's happened to him? something bad? Oh, you'd like that, innit? Er, a little bit of action, eh? You never did like Jethro. (Louise) We'll make a move when the lads get back. (Blue) He's dead! Quickly! He's fucking dead, man! He's dead! His arm, we found his arm! Floating down the river! His arm torn off! Calm down, Blue. What happened? There's something else on this island, and it tore Jethro to pieces! You saw him? - I saw his arm! - And you're sure he's dead? [Blue and Lindsay shout] Blue, are you dicking me around? [Blue and Lindsay shout] (Jed) Everybody calm down! Stay here! Louise, you-- (Louise) Everybody get down! Hide behind something! Move! (Lewis) Come on! Argh! Aaaah! (Louise) Callum, what can you see? (Callum) I can't see anybody! [Jed grunts] I've been shot by a fucking arrow. Aaaah! Fuck! Come here, help me! Get it out! Where are the keys?! [grunting, barking] [barking approaching] Jed! Where are the keys?! I can't help with my hands cuffed! - (Jed) Go, go. - (Louise) No! Go now! [growling, barking] Take this! I'm gonna try and draw them off. Come on. Run, run, run... [shouting] Alright! Over here! Hey!!! - Hey, over here! - Hey!!! Go, go, go! [dogs growl] [whistling] Aaaahhh! [growling, tearing flesh] [barking] [shouting] Oh, Christ!!! No, leave him, go! [Jed shouts, cries in pain] Aaah! [dogs growl, snarl, tear, chew] [whistling] Fuck. I'm gonna head them off. - We've gotta stay to-- - Just do it! Argh! Louise! Oh! [snarling] [Louise shouts] [branches snap] [groans] (Lewis) You alright? Yeah. Fucking unbelievable, right? (Blue) What was that, man? I mean, what's happening? Did you see anyone? Did you see that guy with the crossbow? No! shut up! Fuck me! Couldn't have happened to a nicer prick. [out of breath] Where's everyone else? Where's Louise? (Jo) Why did someone do this to us? I mean, what have we done? Maybe they were mates with that tramp. Maybe. But we didn't kill him, did we? (Mandy) Well, wasn't this one of them old army places? Maybe--maybe them dogs were just left here and-- Yeah, and I suppose they left a guy with a crossbow, too, right? (Jo) Listen, I don't care. I just wanna get out of here, okay? (Mandy) How are we gonna get out? There's no way off this fucking island without a boat. (steve) Killer made it then. (Mandy) Have you seen Louise? Do you know where she is? she died. What? she took one of the dogs over the cliff with her. Where are you going? stop! Please! Why would I wait here? He knows where we are. (Blue) No, no, maybe he don't wanna kill us. I mean, maybe he just wanted Jed. I mean, it's a possibility, innit? A pissed off former inmate or something. Listen. We need to stick together. And we need to help each other. Why would l help you? Fuck him. Let him go. Who gives a shit? (Blue) Yo, Steve. He's got a knife, man. (Steve) Yeah. Well, leave the knife, there's a good boy. You're joking, aren't you? - No. - [laughs] Leave it. Take it. (Lewis) Give us the knife. I will fucking gut you, kidder. (Mandy) Okay, alright. Alright. He's right, we can't stay here. Mandy, those army huts, remember? - (Lewis) Where? - (Mandy) Across the river. The other side of the island. Let's get our shit together and get out of here! Oi! Come on! Wait up, man. shut up! - Oi. - Ow! [panting] Are they gone yet? Come on. Go! [whispering] steve. What? Nothing. Then fuck off. How come he's in charge now? (Blue) He's got the knife, he's the man. Yeah, but surely you could take that off him, innit? Yeah, If I wanted to. But I don't want to. Not yet. Why not? I mean, are you scared? shut the f-- Okay. I reckon there's only three dogs left. There's seven of us, so even if they come fast they can't get us if we're holding these. (Lewis) Maybe they won't come back. (Lindsay) Oh, they'll be back. I know it. (Jo) Just shut up! (Lindsay) Are we going in the right direction? (Mandy) Yeah, this is the way. (Jo) This is the way, I remember. [insects buzz] (Blue) Fuck! Man! My God, that's sick! It's so sick. This is so fucked up. (Steve) What's the matter, Lewis? You're not feeling... rehabilitated yet? He's following us. He's watching us now. (Lewis) What do we do, Steve? (Steve) Get the fuck out of here. Fuck you!!! (Lewis) This is good, right? (steve) Yeah. Yeah, this is good. You first, killer. (Blue) What is this place? (Jo) This is good. So we're gonna be safe here, yeah? (Mandy) Yeah. [rummaging] (Blue) I've never seen a dead body before. (Callum) I have. What--what did that "D" mean, man? Do you reckon it was his name or something? He's not fucking Zorro, is he? Maybe it was "D" for "dead"? [scoffs] Then his name should be "The bloody obvious killer. " (Lindsay) Maybe it's someone else's name. Like who? (Lewis) David, Donald, Derek... (Blue) Dickhead. Davie. Oh, shit! Davie. Davie. Who's Davie? (Lindsay) It's Davie's dad out there. (Blue) No--no way, no fucking way, man! Yeah! He's come to get us, cos of what you did to him! shut your fucking mouth! We didn't kill him, did we? He topped himself, remember? Yeah, why, though? Because of you! All of you. You know something, don't ya? Talk, you little shit! What do you know?! [panting] Nothing! [metal chinks] [groans] You tell me what you know or I will slice your fucking throat. What do you know about Davie's dad? He was scared of him. He loved him, like, but he said--he said he was just crazy. Aah! Alright! He was-- he was-- He was a soldier or something. That's it, a soldier. And that is all I know. I swear. You know more, you lying little fucker! I don't know-- He was--he was-- special Forces or something! I don't know! (Lewis) Special Forces? Yeah... He's gonna kill us, steve. What are we gonna do if this guy's a real soldier? (Steve) Shut up, Lewis. What about the dogs? Fuck the dogs, is that it? All I know. I swear to you now, that's all I know. We're so fucked. No, Jo. No, we're not. This has nothing to do with us. It's not us he wants. It's just those little shits. (Blue) Why don't you go and tell him that, eh? And tell him that I never done nothing either. He's not gonna let anyone off the island now, is he? But we didn't do anything. If he's letting us know who he is-- that means none of us are getting out of here alive. [ruffling] [soft thuds] Fuck off. [Jo gasps] [gasp] Hey. What do you want? I just wanted to make sure you was alright. I mean, you shouldn't really be out here by yourself, should you? Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. Why does Lewis get all the favors, eh? I mean, what about me? Don't you like me? Fuck you, Blue! Get out of my way! I just want a little bit of what Lewis is getting. Fuck off. Who do you think you're talking to, eh? Eh? You shut your mouth! [screams, moans] If you scream, I will fucking kill you, man. I will kill you. They'll just think it was the hunter anyway. Don't worry, darling, you're gonna like this. I swear, I'm good.

We cross at one point, come out at another. Then they can't catch us, yeah. - [Jo shrieks] - (Lewis) Oh! Are you alright? Yeah, thanks. (steve) What are you like, Lewis? He's being a nice guy, alright? You wouldn't know about that. slap her for me, Lewis. You're a twat. Oh, watch yourself. (Jo) so, what did you do to that boy, anyway? (Lewis) Nothing. He killed himself. (Mandy) Yeah, but why? I don't know. (Mandy) Oi! Wait! Wait! Oi, wait! (Mandy) Who is that guy? [whispers] Get down. Eh? What? He's in there. I saw him moving. Let's get out of here. No! We've got the edge on him. He doesn't know we're here. [straining] Louise. Louise! Get some wood! We need to start a fire, keep her warm. Jesus Christ! Louise! (Callum) Lie her down gently. (Jo) Louise. Louise, can you hear me? You have to get off the island. No shit, sherlock. (Callum) Shut up, Steve. Get the boat. I've seen, it's not far. [breathes heavily] Not far. (Mandy) Hang in there. so we find this boat, then, yeah? Where is it? We're gonna have to look for it, aren't we, dummy? Don't call me a dummy. stop acting like one! All you do is follow him around and do what he says, like some little lap dog. If you want a punch-- We gotta find a way down to the shore and find that boat. But--but what about Louise?
