Growing up, I was convinced my great Aunt Lillian was a fairy. She had this way of just knowing when two people belonged together. To my knowledge, she's never been wrong. Not about Sally and Richard Forsythe. Not about Dan and Betty Clarkson. And definitely not wrong about my brother Spencer. He fell in love with my best friend Angela long before she noticed him. But Aunt Lillian has a way of showing people what's right in front of them. I've always pictured what he'll be like. He'll be sensitive and yet strong. Someone who knows me deeply who I could talk to for hours. And definitely romantic. Ah, yes! Yay! All right, now I can stop sweating. One day, that'll be me. But that day hasn't come yet. Not that I have time for romance right now anyway. ♪ Lights on the tree ♪ ♪ You here with me ♪ ♪ Mistletoe above ♪ ♪ For the one I love ♪ ♪ A Merry Christmas baby ♪ ♪ I wanna hold you in my arms ♪ ♪ I wanna make this love go on ♪ I learned a lot about running a business in the last five years. Thank you for calling Castaway Fly Fishing. This is Holly, how can I help you? Stuff I'm sure will serve me well in life. When I figure out what that looks like, I'll let you know. I just try to find the romantic moments where I can while I'm here minding the shop. Mom, mom, he's here! Oh god! Oh, I'm so glad he's home! With my brother moving home to get married, he's set to start taking care of some things around here. ♪ Merry Christmas baby ♪ ♪ I wanna hold you in my arms ♪ ♪ I wanna make this love go on ♪ High, high. Up, up and over, there we go, that's it. Thank you. I await my future with bated breath because I can feel it just around the corner. This Christmas is going to be the best one yet. I'm so excited. Holly, look who's here. Oh, Mr. Brad, hi. I'm so glad you could make it. Well one of Tom's kids is getting married, I wouldn't miss it. Aw. Lori was just telling me how you're still holding on to the old bait shop. Mhmm. And I'm so glad to hear it. This community wouldn't be the same without it. Oh, well, I do my best. Aunt Lillian, hello. Don't you look darling. Oh, thank you. But I'm not the darling of the evening. She's over here. You simply must have a live band at your reception. My niece had one for her wedding in California upon my advisement. You could have your reception in the town square. Wouldn't that be lovely in the spring? Actually, we're planning on getting married just before Christmas. This Christmas? Mhmm. But that's so soon, only a few weeks away. Surely you wouldn't want to make this wonderful couple wait a whole year now would you? Aunt Lillian. Congratulations, darling. You and Spencer make a wonderful couple. Thank you. Lillian, so glad you could make it to the party. I suppose you have your eye on a happy new couple tonight? We'll see. Quick, make your escape while you can. Okay. Okay, what do you want to eat? I'm starving, everything. Oh, is Spencer here yet? No. I don't know why he thought it was a good idea to go to the airport himself the night of the party. Well, he might not have if he knew what you meant by a small engagement party. This is small, ish. Come on, we better hurry. They're waiting for us. So I'm guessing my presence at this party is non-negotiable? How bad could it be? Good food, good people. Who knows, you might actually have some fun. You can take your camera, get some pics of the event. That's just a hobby. I thought the idea was to clear my head while I try to figure everything out. It is, it is. You can stay here as long as you need. Hey, how do I look? You got something on your face. What, where? Oh wait. I think it's your face. I think it's your face. Everyone's so excited to celebrate with you. No, everyone's excited to celebrate a wedding. I think I might elope just so I don't have to plan the thing. And that's why you have me. Oh, yeah. Hey, hey, what are you boys doing with that? Hey, come back. Peyton, Mason, come back here. Peyton, Mason, hey, come back here. Boys, you can run all you want but you have to come down at some point! And those flowers better be in one piece. Little too late for that. Huh? Thank you. Hey, sis. Sorry we're late. This is my old college roommate Chris. Chris, this is my sister Holly. Hi. Where's Angela? Oh. She's in there. Okay. Come on, Chris. Nice to meet you. Finally, the two lovebirds are getting married. I know. I remember the first time they met, he was absolutely starstruck. Almost thought he would propose right there on the spot! I don't get why everything is so complicated these days. You like each other and you get married. Well, it has only just been a year. You gotta snag them while you can, right, Holly? I know it must be hard for you to see your brother and best friend move forward without you, but don't worry, there will be someone for you. I'm betting Lillian's next pairing will happen soon. Who knows? This just might be your lucky night. Here's hoping. Mhmm. Oh, look, it's Mrs. Randall. Oh, I've been trying to catch her all night. There's hope for you still, dear. Don't give up. What are you looking for? Nothing. It just doesn't feel like Christmas without snow, you know? I don't know, I just love the way it makes everything look. It's like the whole world is wrapped up in this peaceful, comforting blanket. Are you enjoying the party? Not exactly in a celebratory mood. It's a little crowded for my taste. Do you usually prefer to celebrate alone? Everyone has a tendency to want to weigh in. And sharing the latest gossip of couples and romance doesn't hold my interest. Yeah, well it can be a lot but they do mean well. Do you have something against romance? No. Sappy love songs, grand romantic gestures, adorable nicknames are all... Fantastic. If you believe in that kind of thing. Well, I mean, that's not all that romance is. Sure. Whatever. You know that's awfully cynical of you seeing that I mean, you are at an engagement party. I call it like I see it. What a supportive friend. Well I'm very happy for Spencer. I'm glad everything worked out for him and Angela. They got lucky. Well, they did also have some help in coming together. Don't tell me you actually believe all that crap about the old lady's predictions. That old lady happens to be my great aunt, and she's never been wrong. You'd have to be pretty desperate to think that's the only way to find love. Yeah, well, we will just have to agree to disagree on that, excuse me. I have a celebration to run. Thank you everyone so much for coming out and helping to celebrate two of the most perfect people that I know, and their coming marriage. Congratulations, kids. To Angela and Spencer! You're such a good friend to them, Holly. But I wonder, perhaps it's time that you started thinking of yourself. Is this it, the moment I've been waiting for? Oh I just know he'll be perfect. Sometimes we focus on one thing. And we miss what's right in front of us. Chris, Chris, come on, wait a second. It's just a small town tradition! Holly, Holly, wait, wait. That had to be the most humiliating moment in my entire life! I think Aunt Lillian has actually lost her marbles! Him, really? He's a cynical snob with absolutely no filter! Guess you and Chris didn't exactly experience any sparks. I don't appreciate random strangers butting in my private life. I wouldn't think you'd set any stock by it. No I don't. But you do, and they do which I find absolutely absurd! You know I'm sure Chris is a really great guy once you get to know him. I'm never speaking to him again if I can help it. Come on, Holly, you love the tradition of pairing people together. Please tell me you're not actually finding this amusing. Mmm. Wait, where are you going? Somewhere to die of mortification. Chris, come on. I'm sorry to make you leave the party. Can we go? You ready for today, Holly? Should be. Today is the opening day at the Everton Christmas Tree Farm. You should come with us, we could show you around the place. Maybe later. Spencer tells me you're from Dallas. Originally yes, but now I'm based in Chicago. Oh, do you have someone special waiting for you there? This was really good, mom, thank you. We need to get going. Spencer. Just let me finish my coffee. You can drink it on the way. ♪ Doorooroodoorootdootdoo ♪ ♪ Dooroorootdootdooroo ♪ ♪ Doorooroodoorootdootdoo ♪ ♪ Dooroorootdootdooroo ♪ ♪ Doorooroodoorootdootdoo ♪ ♪ Dooroorootdootdooroo ♪ ♪ Doorooroodoorootdootdoo ♪ ♪ Dooroorootdootdooroo ♪ ♪ If I summon up the confidence ♪ ♪ To give romance a whirl ♪ ♪ Then I'll break the change in common sense ♪ ♪ Say baby won't you be my girl ♪ ♪ Would you meet me at a Friday dance ♪ ♪ And give romance a whirl ♪ ♪ Let's take a chance on happiness ♪ ♪ Baby won't you be my girl ♪ ♪ Well I've been waiting, anticipating ♪ ♪ Feel my foolish heart palpitating ♪ ♪ Me and you, coming to ♪ ♪ That's the reason for celebrating ♪ ♪ Doorooroodoorootdootdoo ♪ ♪ Dooroorootdootdooroo ♪ ♪ Doorooroodoorootdootdoo ♪ ♪ Dooroorootdootdooroo ♪ Thank you. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Merry Christmas. Yup, Merry Christmas. This sucks. Tell me how you really feel. I think the only thing I've heard more than "Are you and Chris going out?" Is maybe, maybe "Merry Christmas". Well now you know to be careful what you wish for. Oh come on, this'll all blow over in a week or so and no one's even gonna remember that it happened. I will. Well, you're just gonna have to get over it 'cause I can't have my maid of honor moping about. We have far too much to do. - What?! Yes! I would be so honored! Oh, I'm so happy. So I see you finally asked her. Yeah. Oh, this is gonna be the best Christmas ever. I'm glad you're excited about it. I thought you might be mad about how it'd look. About how what would look? Well, with Chris being my best man and all. What? What do you say we split this joint and have lunch? You're kidding, right? That was a horrible way to break the news to her. But we should make our escape before she explodes. Spencer Alan Everton! It's cold enough to snow. Oh, it definitely is. Oh mama, another successful opening day. We had over 80 trees sold. That's wonderful. Just put that here, Chris. Thank you, dear. Wow, what are we having? Soup, and Chris helped with everything. He is great in the kitchen. Really? Mhmm. So, not only is Chris staying with us until the wedding. Spencer's also asked him to be the best man. Maybe next we could just adopt him. I could see why things are awkward between you two. No, awkward? But you could be more polite. Yeah well I'll start when he does. Chris is a lovely young man which you might learn if you let go of your contempt long enough to actually get to know him. He's had some bad luck in life recently. And Spencer invited him here to get away for a little while. Maybe you could show some respect for your brother trying to help out a friend? Thank you. So Chris, I hear you're looking for a new job? Yes. I'm hoping to have one squared away by Christmas. Well what kind of job are you looking for? My degree is in Marketing and Statistical Analysis so something along those lines. Wow, sounds like a profitable career. What happened to your old job? I got fired. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, and totally unfairly too. Chris has never put a toe out of line. He's a great standup guy. Don't you think so, Holly? I'm sure he is, though I wouldn't know. Spencer says you're leaving right after the wedding. Are you going home to Dallas for Christmas? Actually, back to Chicago. Oh, so your family comes there? I'm not really close with any of my family. Usually work through most of Christmas anyway. Oh, I don't mind. I'm not a huge fan of the holidays. How could anyone not like Christmas? This coming from the queen of Christmas. Even Holly has to admit she has a tendency to go overboard. You have no room to comment, as your fiancee, after all wants a Christmas wedding. That's true. I mean come on, it's the time to celebrate the best things in life. Food, friends, family. Love. Ow. What could there possible be not to like? I just find the whole thing overly commercialized. I mean the competitive market has ruined what I'm sure started out as a small heartfelt celebration. But now it's all boxed gingerbread sets, and catchy jingles full of fake platitudes. Well no wonder you hate the holiday. You have missed the point entirely. I speak from experience. Sounds like you need to get some new experiences. So let me get this straight. You think that Christmas is just a big fake and all of us that love it are what? Suckers with loose wallets? It's the oldest marketing trick in the book. You tag an emotional response to a product, you are 10 times more likely to sell it. When you analyze and ascribe dark motives to an innocent holiday, you are 10 times more likely to hate it. Well I prefer to keep my eyes wide open. Then surely you can see all the joy and happiness that Christmas brings people. Appears to bring. Let's not forget all the stress and debt that come along with it. Some people are so desperate to fit themselves in the little box society's made for them, they'd do anything. Well, some people are so desperate to be unique and aloof that, well, they become arrogant jerks. I think what Holly is trying to say is we hope you can at least enjoy your time while you're here. Christmas is a really special time for all of us so... Yeah, perhaps Holly might be able to change your mind. Ow. It's okay. I'll do just fine without any help. Clearly. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll head to bed. Thanks for dinner. Of course. Can I have the butter please? Are you sure this is gonna work? Don't worry about it. A little cut here, a little trim there, and your mom's dress is going to be brand new. If you say so. Trust me, okay? Did you see the dress I sent you? Yes. Oh, it's so pretty. Mhmm. But ooh, that price tag. I know, but, when I tried it on it was just perfect. You know? And they even had it in my size. No alterations needed. It's like a thousand dollars over budget, Ange. Well. Is there something that we could cut back on? I mean I can try but I was really hard pressed to get the budget where it is. I'm sorry. But I mean, you know, this can be romantic too, getting married in your mom's wedding dress? Yeah, I guess you're right. It's wonderful! I know it's a little unconventional but you said you wanted small and intimate, I promise this is perfect. This is beautiful. Sorry about all the teasing lately. I'm so glad that somebody finds it all entertaining. It was a good chance for payback. Spence, you and Angela actually liked each other. This is not like that at all. I know. I promise to zip from now on. Besides, I don't think I'm the one you need to worry about. Hi, Cheryl. You can put your coats right here. Perfect. Please, make yourselves at home. Ooh, I forgot to warn you. Our book club always meets here on Monday mornings. But I figured you could just ignore us. You said you wanted to see the living room? Yes, yes please. Well, here we are. I've certainly never heard of hosting a wedding in a living room, but you know, whatever the young folks thinks is trendy these days. So what I'm thinking is a winter wonderland theme. We can do all white with just like a splash of red, green. I've got to get back to my meeting. Stay as long as you like. Thank you so much, Cheryl. And also we can have marching one, and we'll have the aisle go this way. Holly is such a smart, capable girl, don't you think? - And line the chairs. And then we can have... You haven't had a chance to meet my friends yet, have you? No? Ladies, meet Chris. Oh, hi, Chris. Hi, Chris. We were just talking about what a wonderful job Holly is doing with planning the wedding. Oh, that's right, just like what Cheryl was saying before, she's such a strong capable person. And so pretty too. Hey Cheryl, we just had a quick- - So supportive, taking care of her mom all these years. Oh, she'd be willing to take care of the whole town. Don't you think that's an admirable trait in a woman? She's been unlucky in love though. It's sad to see. All Holly's ever wanted is to be married. Um. Spencer needs you. It's a best man emergency. Wait, aren't you gonna take your book? Oh, look, you're under the mistletoe! Well what are you waiting for? Give her a kiss! Just give me a peck on the cheek, it's fine. No. They're not gonna let it go until you do. I'm not going along with this. You are going to make it worse, please. I'm not gonna kiss you! Good afternoon. Could you just not right now? I'm not really interested in any further humiliation. Thank you. What, got nothing to say for yourself? Gee, Holly. I'm so sorry for embarrassing you in front of everyone! You embarrassed yourself. Yeah well since we are both stuck in this ridiculous predicament together, I thought I might just have your support. Why are you going along with this? Because rumors will spread regardless of what we do! But if you make a big deal out of it, it just makes things worse! Rumors spread because you won't correct them. You have a voice and a say. Yeah well unlike some people I don't really wanna be a jerk. They're the ones acting like jerks. And you're welcome, by the way for standing up to them. It's not like I actually wanted to kiss you either. No offense. None taken. And I'm sorry that everyone's put you in this ridiculous predicament. I'm sorry that it was embarrassing for you. From now on, I say that we just ignore it. We are here for Spencer and Angela. Right. Spencer and Angela. Right. Well, yes, yes, Mr. Hanson. Your license should remain valid through the end of the year. You can bring it in and I can look at it but I'm sure you're covered. Okay. See you soon. Some good memories, huh? Some of the best. So I have something that I need to talk to you about. You wanna give up dad's store to paint houses? No, I wouldn't do it. I'd hire people to do it. I run the company, they do the painting. This is a very successful franchise and since I have an in, I don't know why I shouldn't go for it. I know we all imagined I would want to take over the shop when I graduated, but with dad gone, I can't help but feel that there's nothing for me there. Spencer, starting your own business, that's a lot of work and uncertainty. I know it's not my area of interest but that's not the point. The point is to get experience with building a business. Once this one is safe and running maybe I can move on to bigger franchises. I don't know. That's like me. - It might be her. - No. There's someone walking around town with my face. I've seen her. I thought I should travel. Travel? Are you talking about your college trip? Yes, I, could go away for a little bit after the holidays. Breathe some new air, get a fresh perspective, go away for a couple weeks and come back ready to dive into things around here. Sounds like fun. - Yeah, you should do it. - Mhmm. Gosh, yeah, sounds like a great idea. She's got it all planned out. - Yes. - Yeah. Traveling's expensive. Well, you could wait a year, save up some money. No, I don't want to wait another year. Maybe Chris can help you. You sure you don't want me to go with you, mom? I'll be fine. Help you with what? Oh, my trip. I stayed up last night working on the budget and I'm not really anywhere close. I mean I do have some savings, but, currently the tree farm is like my main source of extra income so if I could increase sales, I mean, it might just be enough. Sounds like you need a new marketing strategy. Or just one in general. Do you have a website? Mhmm. You wanna take a look at it? Sure. What's wrong with it? There's hardly any information on it. Too few pictures, color scheme? Well what would you do to make it better? Well we could start by putting some new photos up. What's wrong with these photos? People connect to visuals. These ones, they're flat. Barely any depth of field or interesting angles. You think you could do any better? I know I could do better. Hey, did you get some of the shop? Yep. Ooh, and the sleigh? Got that too. You wanna try over to the left just a little bit? You want to take the photos? Just wanna make sure we got everything, sorry. Wow. Happy? Yeah, those are actually really good. Well, aren't you two just the cutest! Hi, Miss Maggie. Hi. Did you come to get your Christmas tree? Oh, I already have my tag but I just wanted to say how wonderful it is to see you here after that little misunderstanding last week. I really didn't mean to make things so difficult for you. Oh, well, I wouldn't say- - But I see you're taking pictures. Would you like me to take one of the two of you? No, thank you, Ms. Maggie. Chris is actually just helping me with some marketing stuff. So we're not together. Oh. Yeah. Just working partners. Mhmm. Right. Okay, well. Well, have a nice day. That hurt coming out didn't it? No need to get smug about it. I mean, I like 'em, I just feel that they're, they're not really put together enough. Well, that's because they're candids. If you want more control over everything, you're gonna have to start telling all these people what to do. Hmm. Do some posing, huh? Did you get it? Let me see, let me see. Ew. Why do I look so awkward? It's because we're not shooting a fragrance commercial. Just walk down the path. Walk how? I don't know, just act like you're shopping for a tree. No, really? Why else would I be on a Christmas tree farm? So right here? Right there. This is so awkward. Hey, that laughing looks good. Yeah? Do it some more. Yeah, that's it. Hey, can I see the photos really quick? Here you go. Hey, Holly, give me my camera back. Smile! Okay, okay, yeah, that's good, Just a little fun, come on. No, you could delete that, I look so stupid. I don't know, I don't like that one at all. That one's fine. Hey. You're here early. I thought we weren't starting till seven. Is it already seven? Oh! Right, invitations. You forgot? Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just, we got short staffed at the restaurant and then you know, Spence and I still haven't found a new place, and I just- - Okay, well, it's fine. You're here now, so let me just finish this really quick and then we can start on it, okay? Hey babe. Hi. Hey, Holly? I really don't think I can do them tonight. I just, I need a break from everything. But guys, they have to be done tonight. They have to be in the mail tomorrow. No, uh-uh. Tonight's my night with my girl. We're gonna relax and destress. I'll do them first thing in the morning, I promise. What? I didn't say anything. Where do you plan on going? Huh? When you travel, where are you going? I'm gonna go to east coast. I'll see the Atlantic, Washington DC, and then maybe someday after that I'll get over to Europe, you know. Just do the obvious ones, just to say that I've done it. And then what about when you get tired of traveling? Who says I'll get tired of it? I can't imagine you'd want to leave your home forever. No, I guess I do have a life here. Just waiting for me. So what do you think about Spencer's new business venture? I hope he's really successful. I told him that. But it's not what you feel? It's not that. I thought we had a plan. He was supposed to go to school and then come back and take over dad's shop. And now it's all left on your hands. Yeah, it's okay though because it's my dad's, you know? He build it from the ground up and so I am happy to keep it going. You know, maybe if you say that enough times you'll actually start to believe it. What am I supposed to say? I mean Spencer's so excited about his new business and all that. I just can't rain on his parade. Look, maybe it's none of my business but you cannot put your life on hold for other people. But they're my family. You're not doing anyone any favors by pretending you don't feel the way that you do. You should be honest with them. Yeah but I couldn't disappoint them like that. No, I mean if this is the best way that I can support my family then it's just what I have to do. Well, shouldn't they support you too? What's the worst that can happen? Spencer would let his new business die to take care of dad's shop? And he doesn't wanna do that. And then I would have to live with that on my conscience for the rest of my life. If you do nothing, nothing will change. Are you really prepared to spend the rest of your life in that shop? So I'm just supposed to drop everything? Why didn't you say something before? I wanted to. You made it very clear what you wanted, Spence. I didn't wanna go against that. But you are now. I don't know what the solution is. All I know is that I have run the shop for a very long time and it's not what I want. And it's not what I want. And I feel horrible for saying it. Your dad would have understood. So what do we do now? Maybe I could do both for a time. And maybe we could hire someone to run things. We can't afford to bring somebody else on. Honestly, I do a lot more work than I get paid for as it is. I think it's time to take the next step in moving on. I think we should sell. Your dad's friend Brad was just asking about it. Mom, it's dad's. We can't sell. Mom, you'd be okay with that? Your dad loved that store. But you were what mattered most to him. I am completely sure he would have wanted you to follow your own dreams. I swear you already tested that strand. I see everything on the last string. So nice. What, um? I can just put this here. - Okay. ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ Someone named Spencer. ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy new year ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ Hey.

That hurt coming out a little bit, didn't it? A little bit. Thank you. You're welcome. You are such a good dancer. - All right. - All right. - Thanks. - Have a good one. - You too, bye. - See ya. Hey man, how you doing? Good. - It's been a while. - I know. I just don't wanna spend the whole summer. Yeah, yeah, that's how it is. Who are we spying on? Gosh, you scared me, come here. Come here, come here, go. What are you doing? Potential new boyfriend? What? No! No. Oh, old boyfriend. Not entirely that either. We were never official. We just like went on a couple dates. What's wrong? Your aunt didn't pair you two together? So funny. So? You're not gonna let this go, are you? If you prefer, I could go ask him. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's not that interesting of a story, promise. He's a great guy and all, we just had different goals when it came to relationships. He wanted somebody fun to hang out with and I wasn't going to commit to someone who I didn't see getting serious with, so when I called things off he didn't take it so well. Said that I didn't give us a chance to get serious. Well, you only went on a couple of dates. Yeah, but shouldn't it only take a couple of dates before you know it's somebody you could get serious with or not? I don't know why I'm talking to you about this, I'm sorry. - No, no, I get it. I do. Why keep up the pretense of a relationship when you know it can't go anywhere? It's not fair to anyone in that scenario. Sounds like some sore history there. There's someone I thought I was serious about but didn't work out. What happened? No, no, no, no, no. I told you my story, you have to tell me yours. All right, fine. We met in college and I followed her to Chicago. Things were going great. I was building a career. One day, about five months ago she just up and left. Turns out she never was that serious about the relationship. And then on top of it, you got fired? Which has me questioning where I am now and how I got here. Wanna help me make a million cookies? So this is a tradition that Angela and I started a couple of years ago. I don't think I've done this since I was about seven years old. What, done something to actually celebrate Christmas? Christmas is always a huge blowout in our house actually. My mom liked to try to make the holidays special. There's not much frosting and wrapping paper can do to hold a broken family together. So what about you? Hmm? Why is Christmas so special for you? It brings back good memories of my dad. He loved, like loved Christmas. He's always trying to make it special for everyone. It's one of the main reasons he started a Christmas tree farm. How old were you when he died? 19. I was packing my bags for my college trip when I got the call. You went to college? Well I was supposed to, but mom also got really hurt in the wreck. And Spencer was you know, halfway through with his degree and someone had to be here to take care of her. You've given a lot up for your family. It's what they needed. What about you? What did you go to school for? Business and marketing. Oh, I knew that. Well. Actually, I first started with photography. Okay, that makes sense. Were you like, going to freelance? Well, The more I studied, the clearer it became how impractical it would be to make a life out of being freelance. Unpredictable hours and pay, always having to promote and market your own business. When weighing the risk and consequences, it made sense to make a career out of something more stable. Seems like a shame. Why is that? I have a steady life, steady income. Or had. Well, because you're actually pretty good at this. And you seem to really enjoy it, yeah? Just a hobby now. What if it wasn't? I mean, you just happen to be out of a job currently. Wouldn't now be like the perfect time to revive an old dream, travel the world? Photographer, freelancer extraordinaire. Hey, traveling is your thing. Why not give freelancing a try? Think about it, no boss. You have flexible hours. It's just you, you can do whatever you want. I like stability. Mmm, right. I forgot how boring you are. What are you doing? Proof. That Christopher actually did something to have fun at Christmas. Hey, give it here. Uh-uh, nope nope nope nope, no. Holly. Not on your life. You did not! Okay. Okay, you're right. This is your camera. I should not be messing with it. Two can play this game. No, no! No, no, no, no, no! I'm sorry. All right, who's ready to make coo... kies? What's going on? He started it. We should go... Clean up, yeah that's a great idea. Right. Mmm, Holly. These cookies you and Chris made are delicious. What is your secret ingredient? Is it true love? I guess Aunt Lillian was right all along. It's not... Nothing has changed. I don't get it. What is the big deal? You like him, he likes you. No, no, no, no. I have it all planned out. I have to finish planning the perfect wedding for you. You're off on your romantic honeymoon, I'm off to the east coast for three weeks and he is back off to the city never to be seen again. Or, you could see him again. Nothing's changed. He's still cynical and brooding and he hates Christmas! What more of a sign do I need? Methinks the lady doth protest a little too much. I'm not protesting. I am laying out a logical, rational- - Mmm, you still have frosting in your hair. Where? I'm just laying out an argument as to why this would never work. Holly. You have a man of the tall, dark and handsome variety who might be falling for you who Aunt Lillian matched you with. Now can you explain to me which part of this scenario doesn't line up with what you always wanted? I don't get why this is always such a big thing for you. What do you mean always? This always happens. You start dating a guy and then you backpedal because you're worried that things aren't going to work out perfectly. I've just never seen you do it before you've actually gone on a date. So what, I'm just supposed to chase Chris into the sunset and start our lives together? We just met. You don't have to make a decision this very minute. Just get to know him and see where it goes from there. Seating, flowers, rings. Bachelorette party. Hi. Hey. Just thought I'd come by and see how things are going. Where's Angela? She bailed on me, again. Anything I can do to help? Thank you. Thank you. Have a Merry Christmas. You too. Our evil plan is working. We're definitely drawing new customers. You gonna be able to meet your goal? Mhmm, just barely. Woo, New York, here I come! Well, eventually. If I can ever get this bachelorette party scheduled and figured out. I need opinions since Angela's not here. Not sure I'm the ideal candidate. She says that we don't have to do anything big. She'd like to just relax. We can save ourselves any expense. But? This is just a once in a lifetime event and it just feels wrong to rob her of not celebrating it properly. Sometimes, less is more. Less is less. I, Holly Everton, can do more. That could be your slogan. What's that mean? Seems like every time I turn around you've undertaken a new task for someone else. You ever think you might be doing too much? Nope. I'm happiest when I have a lot to do. And especially when it's helping people that I care about. And that's why you do it? Of course. I think, you need it. You like being in the middle of everything and being needed by everyone. I like helping people, making life easier for them. Is there something terribly wrong about that? No. Just as long as it's what you actually want. Frankincense? I love Christmas, okay? Okay. I kind of already knew that. Just a little bit. You knew that? You'll forgive me if I don't offer to help with the crafting. Oh, come on now. You can't be that bad at it. How many do you have to do tonight? All of them. Sure you don't wanna help? Hey. Everything okay with your mom? She's, upset I didn't answer her call. Wants to know when I'll be coming for Christmas. And that's a problem because? Because I won't be coming for Christmas. I haven't been home for Christmas in seven years. She insists I go into this little ritual every year and I'm not playing her game. What? It just seems a little bit harsh, don't you think? Yeah, well. I'm not going through another round of guilt tripping. As if having me there would change anything. I'm sure that's not the case, Chris. She obviously misses you. Maybe you if you just give it a chance, things- - Look, Holly. My family's not like yours, okay? It's messed up. My mom deals with it by pretending like nothing's ever wrong and we could just sit down at dinner like one big old happy family. And the way you seem to be dealing with it is pretending that they don't exist. This isn't something that needs to be fixed. I had a good reason for walking away from them. You don't get it. You have everything here with your family. No, you're right. You're right, and I can't imagine what that must be like. Don't you see, before you know it seven years is gonna turn into 20 and then it's gonna be too late to make things right? I'm not the one who needs to make it right. Well if you do nothing, nothing will ever change. Hey, I'm not saying that you need to go home for Christmas or that you should even call. Maybe you just start with a text or something. If she does ever decide that she wants to make things right with you, don't you want her to know that the door's at least open? Morning. Morning. Coffee? Thank you. And thank you for doing all this. I wanted to say thank you for your advice last night. I thought about what you said and... You texted her? And? It's a start. It feels good. I'm glad, but you definitely did not have to do all of this. - Well, I- - But, thank you. You're welcome. Although. If you did wanna repay me, I will let you take me out to dinner. Oh. It doesn't seem very gentlemanly. Right, right. Well then, I guess you have to let me take you out then. I will check my schedule. This is Chris. That might be something I'd be interested in. Wow, congrats, man. That's good news. You're getting your job back? I thought they made a mistake at first, but no, man. They even apologized for firing me. They realized they were desperate without you. Is this one ready to go out, Holly? No, no, I have a system. Holly Everton. If you're looking for a wedding planner, press one. If you're looking for a Christmas tree, press two. Hahaha. You left a message. Yes, it is four days until your wedding so I'm gonna need you to pick out a day for your bachelorette party. Please and thank you. Ugh. So, when do you start? Honestly, I haven't decided if I even want to go back. Oh, what else would you do? I don't know. I just don't wanna get stuck in the same place I was. Can we just do it like the night before the wedding, Holly? Right. Yeah, yeah, that works. Great. Right, gotta go, bye. Okay, bye. Oh, shoot! Everything okay? Yeah, totally fine. I'll make it work, I'll make it work. Okay, these have to go in here. Want a what for the bachelorette party? Is that what Angela wants? Mom, Angela doesn't know what she wants. She's left it all up to me. And this is her last night as an unmarried woman so it deserves to be adequately celebrated, don't you think? It just doesn't seem like her. Well I'll do something with just me and her after the party. I just can't wait to see the look on her face 'cause she is not gonna see this coming at all. So what are we doing here? Surprise! Ladies, we have the bride in the house! You look so good. Are you surprised? Yes I am. Come on, come on, come on! Oh here's Rachel! Angela, you remember Rachel. Yeah, from high school! Yeah. Congratulations! Oh my gosh, I'm so excited for the party tonight. Like I love to party. I've gotta go check on the food. Okay. So how are you feeling, like for tomorrow? Holly? Hi. Hey. Hope I didn't keep you waiting. No, no. You look so nice. Well. I believe that should be my line. Proof that I can in fact be romantic. So? Wedding prep seems to be going well. It looks great. Aw, thank you. Are you happy with it? You know, I am. I was a little nervous there for a bit. I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to put everything together but, it turns out I kind of have a knack for it. You know, perhaps it's something you should do more of. Event planning in general. You could start your own business, freelance. That's a thought. Excuse me, I need to run to the ladies room really quickly. Jordan, I'm so glad you can make it! Hey. Hi. Excuse me. What can I get you ladies? Who are these people? Come on, I mean it's a party. Just order a drink, order a drink. Food's gonna be here any minute. Oh, they're here, perfect. Vodka soda please. You guys, we should totally do shots tonight! Woo! She does like to party. Where were we? Okay. Say who's ready to be a bride? Oh, cute. Okay, I gotta pee. Would you like to start with drinks? Or appetizers? Yeah, that would be great. Look, this rose is gonna die. I am gonna see if I can get some water. I will be right back. Oops. Do you need to leave? You seem a little distracted tonight. No, no, not at all. I want to be here. With you. Ladies, to Angela. May your marriage be blessed and your lives be filled with love. Cheers! Cheers! Sorry. I got a call from the caterer. Just had to deal with that for a second. Angela. What's going on? What do you mean? Let's go get dessert, that's something- - I mean with you, Holly. Where have you been all night? Right here. And what is up with this party anyways? I thought we were gonna have a quiet night. I thought this would be so much more fun. Come on, come on, let's just go back. No, what is going on? What are you doing? I'm gonna go. Angela. Angela, you can't leave your own party. Please, Angela. Chris. I was really looking forward to having a good time with you tonight, Holly. I guess you had other places to be. Chris, Chris, wait, please. I don't even know what to say. Yeah, that didn't look good in there. But if you could just let me explain- - Did you really think I wouldn't notice I was only getting half a date? And never mind me. How could you do that to Angela? Well, there wasn't another night. You're leaving soon, and, I wasn't gonna let it slip by without at least trying to make something happen. I mean if you do nothing, nothing will ever change. Don't throw my words back at me. I thought some time together would be better than none at all. Yeah. It's really not. Not like this. Wait, Chris, please, please wait. I really did wanna see you. I have something that I wanted to give you. That is the number and address for one of Chicago's biggest magazines. It's a long story but I know someone who knows someone who works there and... Well she talked to her boss and I got you an interview. An interview? Yeah. To be one of the photographers. Isn't that perfect? You could get into photography without having to go into freelance. And the best part is that he can meet with you next week. I got you in right before the Christmas break so it's all scheduled and everything. You just have to show up. What is this? I wanted to help you move forward. What makes you think I need your help? You don't have to go. I was just trying to give you options. Oh. So this is supposed to be for me? What's that supposed to mean? I was trying to be helpful. No. You were trying to make me your perfect dream guy. I'm not gonna pretend to be someone I'm not just for you. You just seemed miserable at your other job and I didn't want you to have to go back to that, sorry. 'Cause you know what's best for me? 'Cause that's the only way you'd fit in my life, when I need you to fix it for me. You're wrong, you know. You were heartbroken and miserable when I met you but heaven forbid anyone actually try to help you. No, you have to do all of it on your own, right? Your help looks an awful lot like desperation. Stop meddling in other people's lives and why don't you try finally living your own? Angela? Can you open the door please? Listen, I'm really, really sorry about the party. I didn't mean to hurt you. I just, I had a bunch of other things planned for the night like just the two of us. I was thinking maybe we could just forget about what happened and we could- - Why don't we do that? Let's just forget the whole thing. It wasn't anything important anyway. I mean it wasn't the night before your wedding. Please, just tell me how I can make it up to you. You could have just told me. Instead, you went behind my back and planned that whole charade of a party? Because I thought I had been pretty clear about what I wanted. You know, part of me isn't even surprised. What's that mean? You were always gonna do whatever you wanted to do. That's not fair. I've done absolutely everything to make this wedding perfect for you! I don't care about it being perfect! Or how many tiers my wedding cake has or whether my shoes match my earrings or whether the venue has blue Christmas lights or white Christmas lights. But I have to care, because you care. That's what being a bride is, Angela. No, that is what your dream of being a bride is like. Because let's face it, that's what this is all really about, isn't it? You don't have your guy and your wedding but you can pretend through mine. It's not true, you know. Ange, you know that I love you and I just want to help. You don't just help. You take over. And you steamroll over everyone else because you always think you know what's best. When was the last time you asked me what I wanted and actually listened? I hate this dress. I hate it. But I am gonna wear it tomorrow. Because that was the plan. And we can't go messing up Holly's grand plan. Why didn't you say anything? Why even ask me to be your planner if that's the way that you felt? Honestly? Because I knew how hurt you would be if I didn't. I just wanted to make it special for you. Yeah. Well, I'm still waiting to feel that way. Now if you'll excuse me I have a lot of packing to do. Mom. Angela was right. I am jealous. She's getting everything while I'm just here stuck. I mean I'm 24 and what have I done with my life, nothing. You put your life on hold for me. You sacrificed so much for me when I needed you. I'm okay now. I have no doubt that you will find what you're meant to do and who you're meant to be with. Can't I just stay right here? Home will always be here for you. I will always be here for you. But there is a beautiful, wonderful life out there for you. Hey. Hey. First of all I just wanted to say thank you. For being honest with me last night. I really needed to hear that. And I wanted to say that I'm sorry for steamrolling you, for not considering you, for being jealous of you. I ruined what should have been a really, really special memory for you and I'm so sorry. Can you forgive me? I forgive you. And I still want you with me here today. Is that breakfast? Yes. I also got you a little wedding present but I need you to close your eyes, okay? Okay, open. Oh! What? You deserve to walk down the aisle in what you actually wanted. How? Oh, I checked with the shop this morning and they still had the one you tried on so I bought it. But Holly, this was so expensive, how could you even afford this? Oh, I used the travel fund. Oh, no no no no no no. I don't need it. I don't. Honestly, traveling was just a way for me to run from what I didn't wanna face anyways. Besides, I can travel anytime. But you only get to marry my brother once. Thank you. I love you. I love you. Really I'm sorry for everything. We gotta pull it together. And we have a very strict schedule to keep. Okay. If we're gonna get you to a wedding. Okay. Come on. Okay. Hey, I brought the rings. Thanks. Okay, don't think about it. Just do it, just do it. Is there something else? Yeah. We left things in a really bad place last night and I really want to apologize and explain everything but you know, it's a wedding and it's kind of crazy and so just for today, can we put it behind us? For Angela and Spencer and then tomorrow can we talk? What time do you have to leave for the airport? I got my flight moved up to tonight, so I'll be leaving as soon as the wedding is over. Really? Figure it's best if I didn't stick around. Oh, okay. - Holly. - I'm sorry. But I have some things I have to say to you. And if this is my only chance... Please? Look, I'm really, really sorry about last night. It was presumptuous of me to force that interview on you and I had absolutely no right to butt into your life like that. But well I had a very long night to think about everything that you said. And you were right. About everything, especially about me. It's like you said, I should just be honest with how I feel. And I like you. Chris, I like you a lot. And I'm so ready to just, to stop trying to control everything and just see where this goes? I think we've seen that that's not a good idea. Well, at least I tried. See you at the wedding.

Oh, have the best time. Thank you for everything, Holly. It was perfect. All of it. - I love you so much. - I love you. Send me pictures. Okay. Bye. - Bye. I'm so proud of you. Thank you. The stars are so lovely. Well. Contrary to popular belief, turns out you can be mistaken. I can, can't I? Yeah. Sorry to disappoint you. I don't think I'm the one that's disappointed. You just couldn't help yourself, could you? I understand you enjoy fabricating these little love stories and maneuvering couples together. But what gives you the right to interfere with other people's lives, hmm? What makes you think that just because you decided that two people should be together, it would actually work? People don't need your advice to be happy. Are you angry because I pushed you together? Or because it didn't work out? I didn't ask for your meddling. I'm the one who decides what I do or don't want. Yes. Yes, you are. Good night. Hey, mom. Just checking in. How are you doing? Holly? In here. You okay? I think so. I just wish it would snow. Doesn't feel like Christmas Eve without it. Listen, I can't find the cookie trays. Did you take them out to the gift shop? Cookie trays? Yeah, the ones we always use. Can you run out and get 'em? Right now? Just go get them. It won't be hard. Okay. I knew how much you missed the snow. Chris. I know it's corny, but I thought I'd better make it impressive if I had a chance of winning you back. I got the job. What? The magazine job. You did? Yeah, I went to the interview and they hired me. I wanted you to know that it's because of you. You pushed me. Because somehow you know what it was that I needed. So I wanted to come here to thank you, and I just found that I missed you terribly. I'm so sorry for all the hurtful things that I said to you and for giving you the cold shoulder at the wedding. Holly, you brought out parts of myself that I buried for a long time. And I don't wanna lose them again. Oh. This is all so beautiful. It's everything I've ever wanted. If you can't forgive me, then I understand. - No. No no no no no no. It's not that. Then what is it? We would just end up hurting each other again, Chris. Holly, I didn't come here to try to convince you that I'm the perfect guy or that nothing will ever go wrong again. Because we will disagree and argue. And I will never, ever love Christmas as much as you do. And yes. We might hurt each other. Holly. I promise you that I will come back every single time to make it right. Because I love you. You love me? Oh my gosh, it's... So what do you say? Will you give this another chance? I think I'd be okay with that. My one day finally came. He's everything I thought I wanted. Romantic, sensitive, yet strong. Someone who knows me deeply and who I can talk to for hours on end. So, I have to thank Aunt Lillian. She pushed me to face the reality that love is nothing like I imagined.
