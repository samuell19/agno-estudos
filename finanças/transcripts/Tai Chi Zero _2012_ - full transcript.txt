Demonxx SUBTITLES RESYNCED BY ASIFAKHEIR-25 FPS In the mid-Qing dynasty. China's fortunes began to wane. Externally there was encroachment by the West. Internally the Divine Truth Cult caused chaos. Forefathers bless us and protect our troops. Brothers. Defeat the enemy and take the capital. We'll have more rice than we can eat. Kill. Charge. Hundreds of thousands of Divine Truth troops swept through Beijing and Zhili into Shandong. Nothing could stand in their way. Among the Divine troops there was a freak who would later become a great master of kung fu. Lu Chan. Let's get this battle over with and eat Jayden Yuan as The FREAK 2008 Men's Wushu Olympic champion. The enemy's sent in the cavalry. Nan. Time for Lu Chan to show what he can do. Would that be all right? Just do as I say. Okay. Lu Chan. Sorry about this 18 years earlier Guangping Hebei Province. The Freak was born. Shu Qi as the Freak's mother. Named Yang Lu Chan one could tell he was born different. There was some sort of growth on his head. Lu Chan's mother firmly believed her son was destined for greatness and gave all her love to him. Isn't our son adorable? Andrew Lau as Lu Chan's father. Director of the "infernal Affairs" trilogy. Please take a look. Why do you have to eat everything? Because I'm always hungry. Lu Chan's mother was wise to the ways of the world. Men are bad by nature so you must rely on yourself. Ledger. She has to take care of herself and Lu Chan. Winter. Everyone please watch our show. Fung Hak-On as Old Zhao. Founding member of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. What the hell? Is this yours? Does it answer if you call out to it? Candy gourd. He has a horn on his head! Master everyone is leaving. Master he can do all your moves! Nice power! Meanwhile Lu Chan's mother was caught stealing. How much money have you stolen over the years? I have to think about Lu Chan's future. Beat her to death! Who dares? I'm your legally-wedded wife. It's not up to servants to beat me. Master why are we following this kid? Don't underestimate him! This kid has great potential! Ma! I'm afraid I can't take care of you anymore lam Zhao Kan Ping and I perceive great potential in your son. This is known as "Three Blossoms on the Crown". Most martial artists can't attain this even with decades of practice but your your son was born with it there's no limit to what he can achieve! Madam please entrust your son to me. Kneel down! You're the only one who sees my son's potential besides me. Remember you just need to do this one thing well in life. Ma will sleep now 10 years later. Has Lu Chan become a Divine soldier? It seems Old Zhao is the Divine Truth Cult's master-at-arms who recruits troops in the guise of a street-performer. Lu Chan. Big Brother Nan. Sorry about this. What the hell? Make Way! Make Way! Make Way! Out of the way. Master Dong. This treasure of the Divine Truth Cult is all yours. Leung Siu-lung as Master Dong-1970s kung fu superstar. Silly boy risking your neck again. How are you sir? Sorry to be a bother again. Silly boy. Would you rather live or die? What? If you'd rather die I won't stand in your way. But if you want to live you have to listen to me. Never let anyone touch your "Three Blossoms on the Crown". Don't ever practice kung fu again either. Otherwise your life will be in peril. What do you mean? Your master only cares about fighting his battles. He doesn't care about your life or anyone else's. If you go on like this you'll be dead before you know it. No way! My master says the more I fight the stronger I'll get! This martial arts style your master has taught you relies on a hard stance and brute force. All it will do is deplete your internal energy and shorten your life. Look at your horn of flesh. It's turned from red to purple. Once it turns black you're dead for sure. Your only option is to practice internal martial arts to completely alter your body's energy channels. That's the only way you'll escape an early grave. Internal martial arts? Where can I learn that? The Chen Village. Just cure him instead of talking about Chen-style kung fu! So you haven't given up yet? Master I'm a doctor I can't let people die without knowing the reason why. The reason why. You lost your fingers trying to steal Chen-style kung fu. You want others to follow your example? Don't listen to this old fool's nonsense. Just practice the kung fu I taught you. Don't drink! What the hell? Drink the medicine while it's hot. Watch me demolish your Chen-style kung fu! You. Kung fu thief! That's right I did steal their kung fu. And I only stole these three moves which are more than enough to deal with you. Look at your horn of flesh. It's turned from red to purple. Once it turns black you're dead for sure. Your only option is to practice internal martial arts to completely alter your body's energy channels. That's the only way you'll escape an early grave. Imperial troops are attacking! Wake up! Imperial troops are attacking! Help! Fire! Master Dong! Master Dong! Lu Chan. You must hurry to the Chen Village! Beg Master Chen Chang Xing to teach you kung fu. Otherwise you're dead for sure. Master Dong! Master Dong! Master! Master! Master! Lu Chan! Our master is dead. Brother Nan! Just go. Just go! Who are you? Where are you going? My name is Yang Lu Chan I am looking for the Chen Village. You have to climb over that mountain. Which mountain? That one! Chen Village. Could you direct me to Master Chen? You're here to learn kung fu? Yes. Chen-style kung fu isn't taught to outsiders. You should leave. Sir. Where can I learn Chen-style kung fu? Chen-style kung fu is not taught to outsiders. May I ask. Chen-style kung fu is not taught to outsiders! I win. Why won't they let people learn? Out of the way! What the hell? This way! Dear! Are you all right? Where are you hurt? Angelababy as Chen Yu Niang. Yu Niang! How bad is it? Eddie Peng Yu-Yen As Fang Zi Jing. If he's all right let's go. My name's Chen Yu Niang. Everyone in the village knows me. If you feel unwell just come to see me. Yu Niang ls the grandmaster back yet? My mother's sick. He's not back yet. He'll return when he feels like it. Please give my regards to Master Chen. Sure. Which Master Chen? There's only one Master here. Master Chen Chang Xing. Stone Bridge / Archway / Teahouse. Market / Vegetable Stall. Flagpole. Medicine Stop / Post Office. Windy Mountain. Chen Ancestral Hall. Side Annex. Can you handle it? Can this thing really light up? Stop talking nonsense. You have a try. Chen Si Cheng as Chen's Second Son. That Fang Zi Jing's really something. He only studied abroad for a few years and all of a sudden he's turned into the Chief Engineer of Zhi Li Railway Construction. That Wimp I never liked him even as a kid. Now he wears western clothing and drives a western car. Would father really let him marry our little sister? The marriage was arranged when they were kids. Little sister likes him anyway. Great! If little sister finds out she'll think we're trying to mess things up. Fifth Brother. You're here early. What are we discussing today? Who knows? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. They've started laying the railway tracks. You won't have to leave then. The train comes from Zheng Zhou by way of the town of Huai Qing and stops here at the Chen Village. Third Grand Uncle is here. You're all here. Third Grand Uncle. Why are you dressed like this? Stanley Fung Shui-Fan as Third Grand Uncle 4th Uncle 5th Uncle 2nd Brother-in-law Elder Cousin. Where's your father? Who knows? I haven't seen him for a fortnight. Dear fellow villagers. Thank you for coming to this Zhi Li railway meeting. Zi Jing grew up in our village and is grateful to all of you for taking care of him. Now that he's completed his studies abroad and has become the Chief Engineer of Zhi Li Railway he's brought honor to all of us. Why is he wearing the spittoon on his head? May I have your attention please. This is a model of the railway. This object is called a train. It is the most advanced technology from the West and the hope for the future of the Qing dynasty. The train comes from Zheng Zhou via the town of Huai Qing and stops at the Chen Village station unloading sugar and western medicine and loading up with our special local product. It makes transportation a lot easier. Let's say you want to go to Peking from Chen Village. On horseback it's a two-day journey. But riding train you're nice and comfortable and the journey only takes a day. Xiong Nai Jin as the Second Son's wife. Comfortable? Have you ever thought about once the railway reaches our village what will happen to the inhabitants along the way? And what will happen to our ancestral graves? I'll answer that shortly. Please allow me to show you something you've never seen before behold the power of western technology! It really lights up! This is called electric light. This is our hope and future! It's on fire! Don't leave! Foreigners' stuff! Nothing good will come of it. Not bad. Wimp here is really the hope of China. Are you feeling unwell? Not at all I don't want money. If you're not sick and you don't need money why have you come to see me? I'm looking for Master Chen I want to learn Chen-style kung fu. Chen-style kung fu is not taught to outsiders. Since I arrived at this village that's what everyone's been telling me. So they've told you? What an idiot you are! I'm not an idiot. My mom told me never let other people take advantage of you I can't let you hit me for free. You have to introduce me to Master Chen. You really want to learn Chen-style kung fu? Yes. Follow this road. Turn right at the big pagoda tree seven miles down. Turn left at the petrified forest. There you'll find Wu-Liang Mountain. Master Chen. Master Chen is in retreat on that mountain. Here I come! Coffee Beans from Java. It's boiling! It's boiling! This is called coffee. Coffee is ground from coffee beans. Zi Jing brought it back from Great Britain. It tastes even better than tea! Yuck it's more bitter than Chinese medicine! You don't know what you're talking about. The more bitter it is the better the quality. This is how you drink it! What the hell? There is a nunnery on the mountain. Master Chen wasn't there. You walk really fast! I thought it'd take you a couple of days. We should go. Let's go. Where is Master Chen? Don't 9Q! I want to learn kung fu! "Upper Arm Reverse Spiral." "Chi-Consolidating Stance." Take me to see Master Chen. Only If you can make me budge. Stop! His nose is bleeding! I didn't touch him. He just keeps on pestering me. Go! Dear. Where has he gone? Secret River Cave. What the hell? Sir. Can you put me down? I'm stopping your bleeding. Otherwise you might get a blood-clot in your brain. You could die from that. Sir... Fine Tony Leung Ka Fai as the Old Laborer. So do you know Chen-style kung fu? Can you teach me? I'm a laborer who does manual work I don't know any of that what-you-call-it-style kung fu. Then surely you know Master Chen Chang Xing? I want to become his disciple. But as soon as people hear that I want to learn kung fu they either shoo me off or beat me up! You wish to learn kung fu to cure your ailment? My mother... My mother told me I just need to do this one thing well in life. She wanted me to perfect my kung fu. Where is your mother now? She died. You should go. Chen-style kung fu will never be passed on to you. There's no future for you if you stay. Your "Three Blossoms on the Crown" has gone from purple to black. You don't have much time left. You should go see a doctor as soon as possible. Sir. What the hell? You promised to teach me dance when you gave me the phonograph. Come on. Now's not a good time I should be going. Our village is small. Many villagers have never left here their whole life. Getting them to accept new things is not an easy matter. But you can teach me first I'm willing to learn anything. Then I can teach them once I've learned. That would take too long I promised the governor I'd get it done within ten days. What am I going to say to him? Actually if we become family letting the railway into Chen Village wouldn't be quite so difficult anymore. To be perfectly honest it looks like I can't sort this out without you I grew up in this village but just because I'm a distant relative with a different surname I wasn't allowed to learn kung fu I had to put up with your brothers pushing me around I thought that if I learned a modern profession I'd finally gain everyone's respect. But what happened? It turns out nothing has changed. You're a practitioner of the great Chen-style kung fu and I'm still just an outsider I'm not a good match for you. Put it in there. That's right. Post Office. Zi jiﬂg about the railway you shouldn't rush things. As for our betrothal please don't tarry anymore I want to learn kung fu. You're really not afraid of dying? No I have no fear of anything if I can learn kung fu. Very well I'll fulfill your wish. Watch closely. This move is "Parting the Wild Horse's Mane". Didn't you say you want to learn kung fu? Why are you still lying on the ground? Get up! I couldn't follow it. Do it again. Come on. Come on. "Double Pushing-Hands." Again. "Crossed Lotus." What the hell? From this day forth. You're forbidden from setting foot in our village. If you do not abide by this you'll be clobbered by everyone young and old alike. Close the gates. Barn! Governor! The people in the Chen Village are very un-enlightened I've had a dialogue with them for over a fortnight but have yet to bring them around. Enough. Your travel expenses amount to 30 taels of silver. Meals cost 17 taels. Sundry expenses 12 taels. You're there to build a railway not take a vacation! 61 taels of silver in total. All the money comes from the common people. People snicker that I used to be a merchant that I'm a bean-counter. Even my robe of office belonged to the previous Governor. And you wonder how you've let me down? Your Excellency. The building of the railway has hit a snag. You're not the only one who's concerned the company's putting a lot of pressure on me too. They've just sent a foreign consultant to monitor our work. Consultant? Halt! How do you do your Excellency? I'm Claire. Tianjin-based consultant of the East India Company. Prince Chun is a good friend of mine. The Prince sent you here to monitor me? No. The company heard that Mr. Fang's run into some difficulties so they dispatched me to help. Where Fang Zi Jing has failed can a foreign woman sort things out? Your Excellency Claire didn't come here empty-handed. Since the negotiations with the Chen Village have failed we have to rely on the power of the industrial revolution. Lu Chan. You just need to do this one thing well in life. Learn kung fu well from the Master I must enter the village! Entering Chen Village - Walkthru. Stage One: The Entrance. Stage One: The Entrance. Stage One: The Entrance. Stage One: The Entrance. Xiong Xin Xin as Uncle Qin. "Ghost Leg Seven" from the "Once upon a time in China" series Yang Lu Chan vs Uncle Qin. Stage One: Uncle Qin WINS. Day 2. Stage Two: The Market. Zhao Di vs Yang Lu Chan. Sister Yu Niang said you're not allowed to enter. Go. Wei Ai Xuan as Zhao Di. Prodigy from the Beijing Shichahai Sports School. Still running? Over the past 120 years 87 people came to Chen Village to learn kung fu 63 of them left after learning they didn't teach outsiders 11 were defeated at the village entrance, 5 were beaten at the marketplace. Stage Two: Yang Lu Chan LOSES. Stage Three: The Archway. Xu Hui Hui as Sister Mahjong. Head Coach of Italian Tai-chi Team Yang Lu Chan vs Sister Mahjong. Mahjong! The remainder were all stopped at the Archway. Except for 8-fingered Master Dong who became village handyman the only one left is. You got beaten up like this and you still won't leave? Chen-style kung fu is really fantastic! Just like this a grab a pull a hook a pierce-through. It's beaten me up to seventh heaven! This is the first time I've seen anyone so happy at being beaten up. You've mimicked the moves quite well. Yeah! This is how I've learned kung fu since I was a kid I remember other people's every move. Is that so? Then why don't you give them a taste of their own medicine? What medicine? Next time you fight with them remember their moves. Whatever move they use against you just use it back at them. Look! The idiot's back for more! He dares to challenge Brother Tofu. Stage Four: Town Center. Stage Four: Town Center. Stage Four: Town Center. Stage Four: Town Center. Shen Si as Brother Tofu 12th Generation successor of Chen-Style Tai-chi. If you can hit the tofu off my hand you win. This lad's so stubborn! He doesn't care about his life! Next time you fight with them remember their moves. Whatever move they use against you you use it back at them. Knock-off "Monkey Offering Fruit". He should use the move "Monkey Offering Fruit". He should use "Lazily Tucking the Robe". Who pushed me? Your tofu I'm sorry. That was an accident! Rematch? Brother you've won. The idiot made it. He actually beat Brother Tofu. This young fool's really good. He's mimicked the style really well. Every move is just like the real thing Uncle Laborer I've made it. Mother I've made it. Where's Master Chen? Master Chen I want to learn kung fu. What the hell? Uncle Laborer Uncle Laborer I made it Uncle Laborer. Master Chen I want to learn kung fu. Where are you? Mother I've won. What the hell? No wonder the idiot got smart. A master's been teaching him behind our backs. The fool is just mimicking the moves. Isn't that teaching him how to steal our kung fu? It's against our ancestral rules! I'm just an onlooker. What rules can I possibly be breaking? There is a monster! Increase the horsepower! Yes sir! We've arrived at the Chen Village. Quickly! The new railway tracks are ready Sir! Zi Jing. By order of his Excellency the Governor for the purpose of constructing the Zhi Li Railway. Chen Village has 7 days to voluntarily pull down their houses. At the end of that time our machine will forcibly enter and destroy everything without exception. You want to pull down our houses? Wimpy! Don't think we'll be scared of you just because you brought along this crappy thing! Yu Niang. Yu Niang. Out of the way Claire stop! Fang Zi Jing this is your home village. How can you do this? Leave right now with this... this monster! Why doesn't anyone speak up? Third Grand Uncle said they've all retired from worldly affairs. The person to deal with problems like this is the Grandmaster our father. Every day he comes and goes like a shadow. He could be standing right behind you for all you know. But he just disappears whenever something goes wrong. As you know he's a free spirit. Free spirit? He just runs away from his obligations. Yu Niang where are you going? Our Grandmaster may not take up the responsbility but I'm not taking this lying down. Watch out! Hurry UP! DANGER EXPLOSIVES Reduce horsepower to 340. Yes Sir! I've already told them to go to minimum capacity. You can read my thoughts. We've known each other for such a long time of course I understand you. You don't really want to destroy this village. You just want to prove yourself. When I saw that girl I finally understood why you insisted on coming back. Those are two separate matters I came back Claire I came back to make a contribution with what I've learned I want to help those villagers extract themselves from poverty and ignorance I don't care about these things I can see from the look in her eyes she really cares about you I said I have my own mission. Then what about me? I came all this way to this place do you think I really care about this job? You should know very well how I feel I won't consider personal affairs until the mission is over. Then let's finish the job first. This is the instruction manual for Troy. The machine's all yours. The foreign novelty is really ingenious. It's not something we should underestimate. What the hell? What is that? It can even sing. This is called a phonograph. Whether you speak or fart it can record the sound for posterity. It took me a long time to fix it. One more thing I need to tell you you've over-exerted yourself. Your blood is rushing to your head. Now your fleshy horn has turned black. You can't practice kung fu anymore. You've passed out for one whole day and night. While you were asleep something terrible happened in the village. What the hell? A house-eating monster has come to Chen Village. Before long it will gobble up the whole village. If Chen Village is no more that will be the end of Chen-style kung fu. We can't let that happen! We have to stop the monster! This monster is so tough even Chen Chang Xing can't defeat it. What can you hope to do? Not even Master Chen can defeat it? No. Then what do we do? Iron monster. Foreign soldiers. The place for taking showers. Tent. This is you. First you borrow a work uniform from the showers then walk over. The soldiers on patrol won't recognize you. This is how you can reach the bottom of the iron monster. But once you get to the top beware of the guard. Once he passes by you can enter the iron monster directly. Once you've helped destroy the iron monster you'll be a great hero to the Chen Village. Then it will be an easy matter for you to learn our style of martial arts. It's that easy? That easy? First we have to consider how to destroy it Claire may I come in? Come in. Please don't go I've been making a fool out of myself. You made that very clear I need you Claire. As much as those two ice cold rail road tracks. Listen I've always loved you. A. He said it off-hand on the spur of the moment. B. He's finally declaring his long-suppressed love. C. He'd say anything to get ahead. D. All of the above. B. He's finally declaring his long-suppressed love. But your family is so well off and I'm just some... I don't care. But I do care. Since I was a kid I had to keep my head down. If I dare look up all I see is scorn or pity. But when I met you I felt different I'd never felt this way before. You changed me Claire. Yu Niang. Yu Niang. The Next Day. Translate this book. You're the postmaster. You must know English I'm an official of the Emperor I would lose my head if I translate this. If you don't do it you'll lose your head now! It's up to you. Instruction Manual for Troy. Warning. You're trying to draw...? You have to look at it this way. There's also this and this and this! And this as well! I get it. What is it that you're drawing? Fortunately I can understand it. What you see now is the internal structure of the iron monster. Your objective is the central flywheel at the bottom level. But since the bottom level's heavily guarded we have to go in from the top. Behind the door is the passage on the top level. The passage is full of jet vents. Ready Go! At the end of the passage there is a spiral staircase leading directly to the bottom level. There's a machine at the bottom level with a foreign soldier in front of it. We have to get past him quietly from behind. Behind this machine there's another foreign soldier. If you're lucky his back will be turned towards you. You just need to knock him out from behind. What if I'm not lucky? Then just knock him out to his face. When you get here then congratulations you've reached the central flywheel. Once you're there take out the iron stick you brought along and once you jam the gears the monster will be destroyed. Which gears? What if the gears don't get jammed? Then you'll be surrounded by foreign soldiers. You could have escaped during the chaos. But now all you can do is hope for the best. He's over there! Don't let him get away! Grab him! Why are you here? I should be asking you. Have you seen this lock? If we can find this lock we have a chance of destroying this monster. Are you asleep stinky monster? Where can the lock be? Could it be this one? Wake up monster! Is it this one? Hurry up and leave or else I'll beat you up. Did you hear me? After the rails are built I will come for you. If you really care about our future then come with me. Lu Chan. This should be it. Stop! Don't come any closer I'm destroying this monster no matter what. If you destroy it you and I will be enemies. Then enemies we'll be. Go Claire. The machine is ruined and so am I. Zi Jing Claire Claire Claire. Isn't it better that it's destroyed? We can go back to London together. We'll go back together I'll destroy Chen Village I'll destroy Chen Village! What's happening? Out of the way. Looks like Yu Niang. Yu Niang. Yu Niang. What's the matter Yu Niang? Yu Niang. Put me down. Yu Niang. Are you all right? What happened? I have... we destroyed the monster I helped too! Hail to the heroes! Stop! I came to learn kung fu. Can I learn kung fu now? You did all that just to learn kung fu? That's right Uncle Laborer said once I become a hero I can learn kung fu from Master Chen Uncle Laborer? Are you talking about me? What the hell? Father! Father? You're Chen Chang Xing? None other. Chen Chang Xing Grandmaster of Chen-style kung fu Tony Leung Ka Fai as Chen Chang Xing. You lied to me! No you didn't. You never said you weren't Chen Chang Xing. Whatever. Can I learn kung fu now? No. A great disaster is about to befall Chen Village. What disaster? The monster's been destroyed! The reason I got an outsider to sabotage the machine was to make sure Chen Village didn't get involved I never thought you'd join in and even kill someone. Kill someone? What do you mean? When the iron monster exploded the foreign woman was killed. This couldn't be avoided after all. Troops will soon arrive at our village. Everyone prepare for battle! When the troops enter our village we must treat them with every respect. Our goal is to protect our homes. We must do our best not to cause casualties Yang Lu Chan's internal injuries run deep. He can't fight anymore. Towns people take up your positions. Follow my orders. We'll do it in four stages. Remember: It's best to disrupt the enemy or to trap them injuring the enemy is the last resort. Chemical formula: As203. Effect: Dizziness upon inhalation Disorientation and hallucinations may occur. Wind Direction: Northwest to southeast. Wind Speed: 200M PM. Strategem 1: Disrupting the Real with the Fake. Why is it so foggy all of a sudden? Strategem 2: Overcoming Yang with Yin. What are you waiting for? Shoot them! They're firing! Old Liu's been shot! Reload. People of Chen Village hear this! Sabotage of the railway is a crime against the state. Hand over Chen Yu Niang and Yang Lu Chan and instigator Chen Chang Xing immediately. Otherwise all of you will be deemed accessories after the fact. You'd turn your Western weapons against your own villagers? Strategem 3: Overcoming the Hard with the Soft. Fang Zi Jing! Do you have any conscience? It's all your own fault! Arrest them. Go. Yu Niang watch out! Strange. How would this outsider know our Chen-style? Yu Niang. Idiot. Get into formation. Lu Chan. Fire! Get down! Final Strategem: Man and Heaven Become One. Seize them! Load your guns. Everyone let's drive the imperial troops away! Everyone! Drive these soldiers away! Get out of the Chen Village! No... it wasn't me I didn't order them to shoot! Lu Chan! This person's surname is Yang. He is not of our family. How does he know our Chen-style kung fu? To answer your question. This lad loitered in our village for many days demanding to learn kung fu. Our clan tried to dissuade him. They resorted to expel him but surprisingly this lad mimicked their moves and thus came to learn our Chen-style. He has learned almost half of it. In that case... he's stolen our kung fu! He did indeed steal our kung fu. In full light of day. Lu Chan learned our family style before the eyes of everyone. How can that be theft? Stealing in public! That's not stealing? It's not stealing kung fu! But it is stealing kung fu! Silence! Although this took place in public it was nevertheless done without permission. Taking without permission constitutes theft. This idiot put his life on the line to save Chen Village. He drove off troops armed with guns. Doesn't that make up for his offense? He certainly should be rewarded for his good deed but he must nevertheless be punished for his offense. Where's your humanity? How can you say that? It's all your fault! If you didn't give him pointers in secret there's no way he could have won. What? You taught him yourself! This lad has "Three Blossoms on the Crown". He's a once-in-a-century prodigy. Out of the goodness of my heart I tried to save his life. But remembering our ancestral rules I never taught him a single move. Now. His "Three Blossoms" have turned from purple to black. He could die at any moment. He could die at any moment? Our generation has always abided by your rules but I beg you to take his affliction into account. Don't punish him by severing his internal energy channels. Let him live out his remaining days in peace. No. Our ancestral rule is to punish theft of kung fu by disabling it. Then may I ask how is his kung fu to be disabled? I have practiced martial arts all my life but I've never learned how to do that. Do you know how? We must pull out his tendons and break his bones if he can still fight with his leg tendons pulled does that mean you must pull his arm tendons too? And if that doesn't work should we smash his major bones as well? That is what butchers do I refuse to do it. You have to whether you're willing or not. You Zhi, bring out the ancestral blade. Father think of something quick! Only one person can save him now. Who is it? You. Wait! Isn't this just a problem of family name? If he marries me and takes our surname of Chen he'll no longer be an outsider. There'll be no more issue of stealing kung fu. Father do you have any objections? You've always done as you pleased. What say do I have in the matter? Father doesn't object. It's decided then. This is amazing beyond words! Thanks to you the magnificence of Chinese martial arts has prevailed over western armaments. A small community like Chen Village has overcome all your men and machinery. A foreign consultant even died. Once the Prince finds out and orders an investigation I'll make sure you're the first to carry the blame. Look at yourself! What else does the East India Company have up its sleeve? Bring it on! Sister Yu Niang. Why are you marrying that idiot? Don't talk nonsense. My apologies. Chen Village is closed today. It's a joyous occasion for the Chen Village. By order of the Grandmaster all outsiders are barred from entry. Many apologies. What if I insist on entering? My friend listen to me. If you want to cause trouble you've picked the wrong place! Look closely Uncle Qin. Do I look like trouble to you? The End. Actually... not quite the end... I can see the coastline. We're in Tianjin. Man your post! Stay alert! Do we need these for the Chinese army? It's not for the army. Have you ever heard of kung fu? Kungfu? Looks like it's going to rain. Let's go! Quick! Cover the cannons! Don't let the Krupp Cannon get wet. Put up the tarpaulin. From Zero to Hero. We are just halfway through his journey. The rest of the way he'd rely on... Rely on what? Your Yin to be in harmony with his Yang I'm your master so you sleep on the floor. How long do I need to keep this stance? Until I am happy. So this is it? Or there are more to come...? Yang Lu Chan was a member of the rebels. The Chen Village harbors the criminal. Fang Zi Jing is back. He will be seeking revenge. An inevitable battle and a Hero will rise... Tony Leung Ka Fai.
