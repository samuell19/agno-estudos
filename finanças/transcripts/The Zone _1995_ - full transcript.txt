- THERE HE IS. RIGHT ON POINT. I DON'T GET IT. - MAJOR WELLES, HOW DID IT GO FOR YOU? - PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED. - WERE YOU PLEASED WITH THE MISSION? - BAGHDAD, WE CONTINUE TO ELIMINATE STRATEGIC TARGETS. - WAS THERE RESISTANCE? - WE ENCOUNTERED AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF ACK-ACK, BUT WE'RE FLYING SUPERIOR AIRCRAFT. WE WORK THROUGH IT. WE'LL VISIT THEM AGAIN TOMORROW. - WHAT ABOUT THE IRAQI AIR FORCE? - OH, THEY STAY ON THE GROUND. THEY'LL GET THEIR ASS KICKED. TOM. - YEAH, WELL, HE WAS WITH SPECIAL FORCES.

WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? - THERE HE IS. - MAJOR WELLES, WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR COURT MARTIAL? - IT WAS NOT A COURT MARTIAL. - WHAT WAS IT THEN? - I DID NOT STRIKE A SUPERIOR OFFICER. I EXPRESSED MY STRONG BELIEF, AND MY RESIGNATION WAS ACCEPTED. WE LEFT THE JOB UNFINISHED. WE WENT THERE TO TAKE OUT SADDAM HUSSEIN'S WAR MACHINE. WE COULD HAVE DONE IT, WE SHOULD HAVE, BUT WE DIDN'T. OUTSIDE OF THAT, I DON'T HAVE ANY STRONG FEELING. - OH, BOY. - SOMEBODY'S OUT THERE. - YOU GOT TO RELAX, MAN. IT'S JUST A WALK IN THE PARK. - A NICE WALK IN THE PARK, PAL, IF I WASN'T CARRYING A PLANELOAD OF REEFER. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, MAN? I DON'T SEE ANYTHING OUT THERE. THERE'S NOTHING ON THE RADAR SCREEN EITHER. - I'VE GOT MY OWN RADAR. - I'D ALWAYS HEARD WHAT A HOT SHIT PILOT YOU WERE, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE ALSO PSYCHIC. - CONTROL, THIS IS RED DAWN, SECTOR SEVEN. I'VE GOT A LOW-FLYING AIRCRAFT AT 25 DEGREES SOUTH. YOU GOT A FLIGHT PLAN ON THIS ONE? - THAT'S A NEGATIVE, RED DOG. NO AUTHORIZED BORDER TRAFFIC. GO DOWN AND ROUND HIM UP. - ROGER. DESCENDING. - WELL, TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. THE FEDS ARE HOME BANGING THEIR LITTLE INFLATABLE DOLLS. - I DON'T TAKE ANYBODY'S WORD. - GOT HIM. I'M CLOSING. - ROGER, RED DOG. - HANG ON TO YOUR SPHINCTER. - WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? - CHANGE OF FLIGHT PLAN. - HEY LOOK, THE DROP POINT'S BACK THERE. - THOUGHT WE'D DO A LITTLE OFF-ROAD FLYING. - OH, YOU CRAZY-- YOU'RE CRAZY MAN. - ROGER, THANK YOU. - WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? - THERE'S YOUR NOBODY.

HERE'S HOW IT IS. YOU KILLED A WOMAN. YOUR FINGERPRINTS ARE ALL OVER THE GUN. IF YOU COOPERATE, WE'LL MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY. AND IF YOU DON'T, THE POLICE ARE GONNA FIND THAT DEAD WOMAN, AND THEY'RE GONNA FIND YOUR GUN. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DO A LITTLE JOB FOR US. RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY. YOU CAN OPERATE THE WAY YOU WANT. FINISH IT THE WAY YOU WANT. - WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY WANT FROM ME THAT'S WORTH DOING ALL THIS? - LOTHAR KRASNA. TAKE A GOOD LOOK. HE'S IN THE WEISBACH MOB. GAMBLING, DRUGS, RACKETS.

IT'S THE ACRHIVE FACILITY IN MORAVASH. KRASNA RECEIVED A SHIPMENT OF URANIUM-238. HE'S EXPECTING ANOTHER SHIPMENT IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. - HE'S CONVERTING IT INTO WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM. - ONE MAN, WITH A SMALL SUITCASE, COULD NOT ONLY DESTROY THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, BUT HE COULD TAKE OUT HALF OF MANHATTAN. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. - SO YOU WANT THIS PLUTONIUM TO GO AWAY. - AND LOTHAR KRASNA. - THE AIR FORCE COULD TAKE CARE OF THIS IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. - NO, WE CAN'T BOMB THE NUCLEAR FACILITIES OF AN EMERGING DEMOCRACY. YOU HAVE TO INFILTRATE, DESTROY IT, AND GET OUT. WE'LL SUPPLY A SOPHISTICATED GUIDANCE SYSTEM. YOUR CONTACT WILL HAVE EXPLOSIVES. - AN INNOCENT WOMAN DIDN'T HAVE TO DIE FOR THIS. - TO LOTHAR AND TO HIS GREAT GENEROSITY. - MY FRIENDS, ENJOY. LET'S SEE HOW MY LUCK IS TONIGHT. - NOT TOO GOOD, LOTHAR. - FORTUNE SMILES ON ME. - LOTHAR, MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT? - YOU'RE INTERRUPTING MY GAME. - THEY CAUGHT STEFAN AT THE TRAIN STATION. - TRAIN STATION? - HE WAS CARRYING THIS. - TAKING A LITTLE VACATION WITH MY MONEY? - LOTHAR, PLEASE. - STEFAN, I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.
