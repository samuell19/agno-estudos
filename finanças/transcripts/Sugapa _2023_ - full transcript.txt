- Mama Rita... - What? The tricycle's here, - Let's go? - Oh, yes Ben, wait a bit. Dear, are we good? We'll finish up, wait a sec. Thank you dear. Is this finished already? Make sure everything's checked. Brother! Rita! Come. Come. Follow me. - Have a seat. - Okay. Just a sec. Okay. I'll just sign these. Where will I sign? Number two, please! - Good morning, ma'am! - Good morning! Are you making a deposit? Yes. I'm really sorry for the delay. - Oh, Rita... - I know we're past the retention period. I already told you about this, Rita. If it didn't blow up in your faces, you guys wouldn't have done something. It's a good thing you were able to come up with money, or else you and Mama Luz' payment would've gone to waste. Yes, actually I used up what little savings I have, and the rest, I just borrowed from a friend. Everybody chipped in. Ben and Ana as well. Well, you know, the closed-bidding is tomorrow already, so it's really important that the money makes it in time. You're going to have to pray and wish that nobody else takes an interest to the property. But, I don't think anyone's interested in our lot. Well, maybe, we're not sure. But it is what it is. The bank doesn't really care who gets it. But it's our home, please tell me no one's gonna take it from us. We'll see, I can't promise anything. - Here you go. - There, very good. Remember, the closed bidding is due the next day. It's important that no more delays are going to happen, the bank will call you and from there you'll know if you've won or lost the bidding. How does it work? What if we win the bidding? What will happen if we lose? Okay, listen. If you win the bidding, the property is yours. But if you lose, it only means that somebody else placed a higher bid. And the property is theirs. I hope it doesn't come to that. Yeah, like I said, all you can really do at this point is pray. But don't worry, I feel good about this. Alright then. Thank you so much! Alright, I'll try my best. Let me see what I can do, okay? - See you later? - Yeah, later. I'll call you. - I love you. - I love you. That's too early, Ron. Yeah and I'm already losing. Let's see if your luck holds out today. - Who did you bet on? - Black. Wrong choice, man. Maybe they bounce back? Idiot! You're an idiot, Ron. Ben, you jinxed me. Housekeeping! Hey Mara, do you know of any more job vacancies? Aren't you content with our work in here? I need to earn more money. I'd even take a graveyard shift. Graveyard? How about as a prostitute? You'll only have to spread your legs. Not like that! Somewhere open 24-hours, like an eatery. Wait, really? You'd trade what we're doing here for an eatery? Make sure everything's loaded for delivery, okay? Count everything. Hey, Ben! Ben, come here! Boss! How many crates have you done? Boss, I'm almost at eighty. - Eighty? - Yes. - Will you finish by 4 PM? - Yes, boss! Yeah, I got this! - You better be sure. - Yes. Hey, how's that issue with Ana going? I hope you gave her the money you asked of me? Of course, boss, I even used all the salary I earned recently to chip in. Good. Good on you! I hope it helped somehow. It sure did, boss! Alright, make sure everything's done by 4 PM. - Will do, boss, no problem. - Everything should be loaded. - Yes, boss. - Alright then. Sure thing, boss. What are you up to? I'm just wondering how many years it'll take to pay back the land loan. Don't sweat it. What matters is we found a way, right? Thank you. Your money helped big time. Not now. Mom's awake downstairs. So what? We're married. - Ma? - Yes? Is there a problem? It's been three days, dear... I haven't received any call. Relax, Ma! Didn't Uncle promise he'd handle it? Plus... he mentioned no one's interested in the land. - You're right! - Mama Rita! Yes? Ana's right. Just relax. Soon enough, you'll get a call. - Just relax... - There you go. - Eat up and drink your medicine. - Sure thing, dear. I'm okay now. That's Arturo, isn't it? What's that asshole doing here? This is what I was telling you, Mike. Look, all that should be Madre de Cacao. Look how dense it is. You take care of it. Hello! - The ones with deep... - Hello, Rita. - Bro, what happened? - I'm really sorry. Arturo placed a bid. - What? - He got the property. - Arturo won the bid? - And I didn't think that that he'll be the one to win. - I see, thank you. - I'm really sorry, Rita. Thanks, no problem. Hey, Arturo! What are you doing here? Damn you. The bank told me... I won the bid. So, this property's mine now. But Uncle, why did you do that? You know my mother inherited this land! You know, little girl, the bank's got its rules. Anyone can bid. Right? So, I'm not breaking any rules. And I'm not doing anything wrong. Uncle, you shouldn't have join the bid! We could've saved our home! Why don't you talk to the bank? Don't complain to me. I'm out of it. You always wanted this land, didn't you? - Enough, dear. - No, Ma! He's playing dirty! I knew you always wanted us out! Traitor! Enough of this! Stop bothering me! If anyone's to blame, it's your husband. - who sold and mortgaged this land. - Don't bring the dead into this! If this was passed down to me... and was given to me by Mama Luz... I'd have put up a business by now. I told you, Mom, - he's always been greedy! - Ana, Ana! - Enough, dear! - Enough! Enough! Calm down. Arturo. Brother, can't we... please sort this out? We're family, right? Maybe... Sure! I'm fairly reasonable. I have no problem if you want the property back. Okay... I want half a million. I'll waive the interest. Simple as that, right? Your cousin's such a jerk, Ma! Traitor! What's done is done, dear. But he's not wrong. He didn't break any laws. But still! He's shameless! God will guide us, dear. I'll pay back what I borrowed from Linda and that lender. I'll just plead with them not to add any interest. We'll get through this. God is merciful! Alright. Please sort this out there. - Ma? - Yes? - You alright? - I'm fine. I'm fine now. Ma, let's go. Arturo really is something, right? Yeah! I thought he was nice! - Turns out he's sly too! - What? How so? But you know his wife... My God, the way she goes to church and prays! I've been drinking since earlier. Choleng, thank you so much! Thank you. I'd go somewhere else, - but you're all I've got. - Oh, enough already! What's with all this drama? You're always welcome here! Don't act like you're a stranger! You're so annoying! If I ever see that Arturo... - What? - I'll punch him. Do you want the rest? You can have it. Are you sure? You know I don't drink. Okay. What's on your mind? I want to get our house and land back from Arturo. I'll do whatever it takes. What's your plan? I want to leave my job, the pay is too small. My hair would turn to white working before we'll get our property back. So, do you have a plan? I want us to move out. Like, on our own? Why not? We're married after all. How about Pampanga? All the tourists are there. Businesses are everywhere too. But do you know anyone there? Mando. We can trust him. He can find us a place to stay, somewhere to work. He'll help us. I'd go anywhere with you. Thank you so much, man! Come on! We gotta help each other out, right? Have you been here long? Yeah, maybe five years. Here we are. Welcome to Hotel California. Caloy! Caloy! - How's it going? - Good, Mando! These are my friends, Ben and Ana. They're from La Union. That's Caloy, he works for the boss who runs that gambling spot. Come on, come on. It's a bit noisy here, but you'll get used to it. Right? It's got everything. Barber shops, laundry services if you need them. Everything! Convenience stores, bars, hangout spots. You won't need anything else. - Cool! - Okay? Let me show you the second floor. It was originally a hotel. But the contractor didn't continue, so now we benefit from it. Right? Just think you're living in America. That's why it's called Hotel California! Welcome to my penthouse. Hold on, let me open this. Okay, come in! I've got to run. I'll leave you guys here for now. Alright, see you upstairs. This is how it is here, huh? In the city? Yeah, so many new things, and many old ones too. Lots of fresh stuff, but plenty is rotten as well. Love, Mando will help us. And when it comes to the two of us, I have your back. Here's your coffee. Eat up! Eat up! That looks delicious. More coffee here. This tastes good! Well, we wake up early. You know how it is in the province. I know. Fair point. Where's Ben? Oh, don't wait for him. He takes ages to shower. Oh, Ana, I'll handle looking for your job. Didn't I say I'd find one for you? If ever, can you work nights? Sure, no problem. You good? Alright, great. Let's eat. Here's your coffee. Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm really sorry. It was open. Ben, let's eat. I thought you were going to take a bath? The line was so long. It's first come, first serve here, only one bathroom after all. Hey, remember Caloy from yesterday? Caloy, the one from downstairs? - Ah, yes, Caloy. - Remember? He'll accompany you later, okay? He'll go with me? Yes, I have other errands. What time are we going to the restaurant? Well, whenever you want. Maybe after eating? Bro, is the owner strict? No worries, Sir Gener's kind. Don't embarrass me there! I recommended you to be a waiter. I'll do my best, as long as the pay is good. Don't worry, he's not stingy! He's loaded! Do you work there? No. So, where do you work? Anywhere, really. As long as a job presents itself, I'm game. The important thing is, you both work hard here. To get ahead in life. Right? Okay? Let's eat. This is good. Tastes good! Ben, right? Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Do you have restaurant experience? To be honest, sir, I don't. Alright, don't worry, we'll train you. You can start today. Boss? - Thank you so much, boss! - Great! Always be courteous and smile at the customers, okay? The manager will fill you in on the rest. Alright, sir. Catalina! Hello, Ma! How are you? How's my daughter? I'm doing good, Ma! Have you found a job already? Right now, I haven't found a job yet. But Ben already found one. That's just how it is. You just gotta keep your hopes up. Ma, I'll call you as soon as I get a job, okay? You'll surely find one. You take good care of her, okay? - Of course! - Alright. It works both ways. Alright. - You two have fun and— - You take care. Alright, Ma! I know what you two are gonna do tonight. Why wait? Thank you! Thank you, ma'am, sir! - We hope you come back! - I told you he's your type. Cut it out! Thank you ma'am! - Thank you. - Ben, clean that up. - Ma'am, thanks! - Thank you, really. See you again soon! Take care of the plates first then just come back for the rest. - Alright. - Miss, order! Yes, ma'am! Really, love? You're allowed to bring home food from work? Yes. These aren't leftovers, are they? Of course not! These are just excess from all the meals they cooked. They're really kind, they gave all of these. See! Wow, you're really lucky! I know, right? I think... adding up what I earn in a week, plus all the tips, it would total to... just one-month salary back at the rice factory. Even more! More. I hope this continues. Me, too. By the way, did you hear from Mando? Any news? No I haven't talked to him yet. I'm just waiting for his message. Don't worry, Ana... Soon enough, I know you'll find a job. I'm sure of it, you're the smartest person I know! Go on, eat. Thank you. Miss, beer please. Remove the cap. Oh and a cigarette, red. You're Mando's visitor, right? Yes. Where are you guys from? From La Union. Ah, okay. Aren't you the... Oh, yes. I'm really sorry. - No, it's okay. - I'm sorry, I really am. I covered up immediately, you didn't see anything, right? I'm Nancy, by the way. Ben. But miss, next time make sure the door's locked, okay? You'll never know... What can they do to me? Rape me? Abuse me? They won't even try. You see this? Ana, right? Yes, sir. Ana Fuentes. How old are you? I'm 25. You look young for your age. What's your previous job? At a resort, sir, I did housekeeping. Honestly, Mando, I already said yes to another applicant. You guys are quite late. Really? That's okay, I'll just tell Sir Francis the job's already taken. No, let me, he's a regular in here. Alright, thanks! I'm sorry, okay? - Bye, sir. - Goodbye. Okay, thanks! - I'm really sorry. - Thank you. Hey, Sarge! Mando! How are you? Long time, huh. Long time! Is she your wife? Well... Yeah? Is she new? Maybe you could... What? No, Sarge. That's my friend's girlfriend. She's looking for a job. What happened, did she find one? There's no vacancy, apparently. Can you introduce me? Come on! Okay, Sarge. Let's go. Ana, this is Sarge. Sarge, this is Ana. - He wants to get to know you. - Sarge, I'm Ana. With a face like yours, I'm a fool not to introduce myself. Oh, really. Sarge, we'll go ahead. Can I... Can I get your number? Oh, Sarge, what would I use then, if you take my number? Ana Fuentes, sir. Ana Fuentes. Alright, Sarge. Mando, who is that? That's Sarge Teodoro. He's one of the protectors here in Angeles, especially for bars. He's cool. Is he a police officer? He used to. Hello? - Hello. - Hello Sarge? Ana. I got you a job. Really? Yeah! Sarge, thank you very much! Don't mention it. This is a solid investment. A guaranteed win! So many tourists and foreigners, we're going to make money here. It's a sure thing! No, no, no. We're not gambling here. - This is going to work. - Sarge! Yes. Mr. Tan, Mr. Tan, excuse me for a moment. I just need to sign a document. Alright, I'll call you back. Thank you, Sir! Okay. Sarge, you're here. Of course. Would I miss your first day at work? Thank you so much! You're welcome. What's important is that you have a job. I'll head in now. Excuse me! Sir, there are still spots available upstairs. You can go now. How's the sales? It's doing fine, sir. Here's our yesterday's sale. Sir! - Oh, Ana. - Good evening. How was your first night? We have a lot of customers. - We need to be alert, okay? - Yes, sir. Miss, Miss! Miss. Okay, we'll... Can I order a sisig and sizzling mushroom? - Is that all, sir? - Yes. Love, let's eat! Wow, this is fancy. And the food here looks delicious. Yeah. Did you hit the jackpot or something? Nope. You wouldn't bring me here if you lost, right? Just a little bit. But remember, we're saving up money for something. Of course, I always keep our priorities in mind. Let's just consider this a celebration for what we've done so far. As we should! Dig in. Be good for grandma, okay? Of course, she'll be... Ben! Hey! We've got a full house! Hey, Sarge, didn't expect to see you here. Ana! Just passing through. Miss, another beer, please. Sorry, Sir, it's a bit busy. No worries, no worries. How's it going for you here? It's all good, always hustling every night. That's the game. But hey, when I... eventually open my bar, you're gonna be my manager. Manager? Just like that? I might need to learn how to be one. You won't have to, I got you covered. Sir, another beer? For you. A tip sir, you haven't billed out yet. It's fine, take it. Miss, I'd like to order! - Thanks, Sarge! - Keep at it. Miss, can I get some water? Sir. Thanks. Oh, Sarge, you're still here? Ana, I was waiting for you. Come, I'll drive you home. Oh, no Sarge, I'm good, really. No, there's a lot of creeps in here. - At least I can protect you. - Ana. Ben! Meet Sarge, a friend of Sir Arman's. He's a regular here. Ben. Good timing, Ben. I was just planning to bring Ana home. Alright then, Ben. Stay safe! Ben! Ben! It's morning and you're still drinking? Who's this Sarge? - Sarge? - Yeah, Sarge! Sarge, he's our regular at the KTV, friend of Sir Arman. He's a good guy. What do you mean, "good"? And what do you mean by "friend"? Men always play the nice card. No one's that nice. - Oh, come on! - What? He seems really into you! Ben, what's gotten into you? You're drunk. Let's go to bed. You're just jealous, aren't you? I'm not jealous! - Sure sounds like it. - Damn it... You know I hate it when you do that. You're jealous. - Come on, let's go to sleep. - I'm not jealous. Mando's not here yet. Let's go. Come on. Okay, okay! Just let me finish this. Hurry up. Hey, bro! - Where's Ana? - Upstairs. - Can you tell her I'm here? - Alright, alright. Ana! Who's that? It's Nancy, she sent a message. She's asking if we can drop by the store, it's her birthday. She's also inviting you. A birthday? Why's she sending pictures like she's fishing for compliments? Don't jump to conclusions. You know how kids these days are, right? Oh, Ben, seriously! Before you go flirting, remember why we're busting our asses here. Of course, I get it. Here's the receipt for the money sent. I'll head out. See you. This has been here a while. Here you go, this should cover you for a week. Oh, thanks! That's for your rent. Should I count it? Thank you! We're on! Line up. Alright, single file, single file. Out of the way, five hundred. Queue up properly! Your ticket, your ticket. And you? I'm all in five hundred. - That's another bet. - How about you? This is the last fight, guys! Bro, we're not gonna get raided here, right? That's Marlon. He's bankrolling this place. Gives a cut for this building. See? He's being protected here. Ten percent. For example, if you bet a hundred, you only get ninety back. Abby, can you get me a Sisig and Crispy pata? For upstairs. Thanks. Miss! Man, they're wild in there. Miss! Sir? You want another beer? Can I take you out? I'm just a waitress here, sir! Come on, I got you. No, sir, please. - I'll take care of you. - I'm just a waitress here. Come on! Sir! No, sir. Sir! - Domeng! Domeng! - Help! - Abby! Abby! - Sir, you're wasted! - Abby, pull Ana out! - Come on, he's drunk! He's drunk! I just wanted to order. Go on, go on. She's too snooty! - I was just gonna order! - You're drunk! You're high! Come back some other time. - You'll get used to it. - Ana! Alright, I got this. Ana, you have to be patient, he's drunk. Sir, it's not just that. He should know his limits. I get it, but next time, just steer clear. Sir, why am I the one in the wrong? I'm not saying you are. Alright, I'll get that guy banned. Sort this out, we've got lots of customers. Go. Damn it! Come on! Get him! Black wins! Alright, get the other bets in! Place yours. Boss, two hundred on black. Place your bets! Black, two hundred. Black. You? How much? Place your bets here. Okay we're starting, Here, here. no more bets? Come on! Fight back! Fight back! Damn it! Looks like you're on a losing streak. You still wanna bet? I'm all out, boss. If you want, I can spot you? Here's fifteen grand so you can get back in the game. Alright, boss. But you'll pay me back, right? Place your bets again! Take this one's bet. Did you place yours already? Alright, black or white?! How much, boss? Two grand. Two thousand. Where are you placing it? Black? White? Black. Goddammit. Come on, get it! Fight back! Honey, sun's up already. I had to do overtime. It was packed earlier. My head's killing me. You okay, love? I'm fine, I'm okay. - Want some meds? - No, no. I just need to... shut my eyes for a bit. Let's... let's talk tomorrow. Hello, Ma! It's been a long time since we last talked, dear. How are you doing? Why aren't you calling? Are you doing fine? - I'm starting to worry. - Oh-- Ma, don't worry too much about me. Are you eating on time? How's Anton? He's fine. Anton and I are fine. We're always able to make do. Alright, Ma, I'll send money today. I'll just transfer it on e-cash, okay? Thank you so much my dear. That'll be a huge help on us. Okay, take care. Okay, Ma. Hey, manager. Good evening, sir. Good evening. Take care of this. - Okay. - How are we doing? Slow night, sir. Are there customers upstairs? Yeah but just one table. That's better than nothing. When they're done, we pack up. Our electricity bill's getting too high. - Okay, sir. - Okay. This sucks, we have no customers. I didn't know there will be nights like this. That's normal here. Would you like to apply as a dancer? Hold on. Hello, babe? I'll be going to the market. That your list? Mhm. Here, have some coffee. Here, love, I hope that's enough for now. Bro, Ana's going to the market, you need anything? Hold on a sec. Yeah, I do. Ana, can you grab me some... maybe three kilos of pork and some veggies for a stew? Here you go. That's Ben's favorite. Really? Oh, right. I've got a list here. And if anything's missing, just grab it and deduct from this, okay? - Sure thing. - You got this. Babe, I'm heading out first. Keys. I'll go ahead. Thanks. Who hasn't paid yet? That's Anabelle, and Paco. Barbie and Panyero, too. We'll go broke. Collect from them. Alright, boss, later. Hello! Hey, hold onto this. Wait for me, okay? Ben! They're calling you. I'm off. I told you, I'm on my way. What's up? Dude, sorry, I've got nothing right now. When? Maybe next week, dude. Problem is, I need it now. I told you I'm broke right now. It's not like I'm running away with your money. What did you say? Am I bugging you? You taking me for a fool, huh? You son of a bitch. What did you say? Screw you, too! You have the balls to act like that? Son of a bitch! Hold him up. Hold him! Damn you! Get him up! Get him up! Asshole! What now?! On your knees! Come here! You goddamn animal! No, please. I could kill you right now. You have the gall to borrow money, you should pay up! Lon, stop it! - Stop that. - What? - Drop it! - Damn you all. Stand down! Stop that! You've got some nerve! Hey! Drop your gun! Drop it! Get out of here! You better warn your friend! Let's go! Jeez. Here. Use this. How's the injury? You messed up man. Didn't you tell me you'd save up? Right? How much do you owe Marlon? 15 thousand. You lost fifteen grand gambling? What the hell were you thinking? Bro, what do I do? Maybe you have some cash? Can you lend me some? Nope! I've got my own problems too. Just make sure Ana doesn't find out, okay? She'd be furious. You know, if I just knew a quick way to make money. Quick cash. These days... people buy sex videos. That's quick. Big money. If you've got some. But that Marlon, that guy's bad news. You need to pay him. I gotta go. Ben, what's wrong? What happened? Love, it's nothing. It's not nothing! I heard Marlon beat you up. Marlon didn't lay a finger on me. How much do you owe him? Fifteen grand. You gambled that much? I lost, okay? Why'd you risk our money? Ana, I'm sorry. But don't forget, whatever it is you're thinking... win or lose, I'm doing this for our future. No, Ben! You're gambling our future away! Damn it! Where are you gonna get the money to pay him? Ana, wait! Babe! Dude, can you take me to table five? Hey! So Ben, what's up? Care to pay up? Man, I'm so sorry, I'm just swamped at work right now. Are you messing with me? Looks like you're not paying anymore. Look, I haven't gotten back on my feet yet. Am I the one to blame for your shit? I need that dough. I'm not avoiding you, we live in the same place! Just a reminder. Debts are meant to be paid if you don't want anything happening to you. Alright, alright, I'll pay, okay? This could work. Your friend seems to be in deep water, huh? You sure about this? Are you? Looks like your friend's getting cold feet, Mando. Ben? Ben! He's talking to you. Sir, can you mask the face, like, just a square? Oh, pixelated? Blurred? - Yeah, pixelated. - We can do that. But what a waste. This is good stuff. Or maybe just zoom in so the eyes and mouth are out of frame. You're friend's too demanding. Mando. Ben? you've got to decide. Sir, this is fine. - Alright, alright, this'll do. - Got it. Alright, get a copy. Vin? withdraw fifteen for me. Alright. It's fifteen grand, right? Yeah, fifteen. Then go get fifteen. Dude, check this out. Isn't that Ana? She's done for. Tasyo, one sisig, one crispy pata, one boneless bangus. That's Ana! Where did you find this? that's what's viral now. Give it here! Ana! What's going on over there? Ana! Abby! Hey! Ben, what happened? Ben, how could you do that? Ben, talk to me! Look at me, Ben! Ben! Ben, talk to me! How could you do that to me? Talk to me, Ben. Ben! You asshole! You humiliated me! Babe... Just wait. Wait a minute! Damn you! I can explain... Just wait! Babe! Babe, I'm so sorry! - Babe, please, I'm so sorry! - You humiliated me! Babe, I'm so sorry! Damn you, Ben! Babe! You humiliated me! Babe, enough, enough. Babe, stop it! Babe, please. Enough. You screwed me over. You humiliated me! Ben! I'm so sorry, so sorry. What did you do? I'm sorry! What did you do? I'm so sorry, babe, so sorry! Sorry, so sorry! - I'm so sorry. - What happened, Ben? Goddammit! Shit! Forget about her! I'm sure she's blocked you already. It's been a year, man! You were such an idiot! I just hoped she'd have forgiven me by now. What you did was so messed up! Who in their right mind would, sell a video of their girlfriend? Look, I admit it was wrong. Move on already! She might've married someone else by now. There they are. Let's go! - Mr. Brown! - You're running late. Ah, yeah, my bad. I mean, she got caught in the traffic jam. You take forever to get ready. Oh, no biggie. But seriously, I'm sorry. By the way, Mr. Brown, this is Melody. - Hi Melody! - Melody. Shake his hand. You two make a cute couple. - Hey! - Mando! Your bar's packed tonight. You're raking it in! Just lucky. You know Sarge, he's great with promotions and has a ton of connections. He's got the magic touch. Right? Congrats again! Thank you, really. Hey! Sarge, congrats! The bar's buzzing tonight. What's the deal? Ah, I just dropped off a girl, for one of our regulars, Mr. Brown. Had a delivery to make, you know the drill. I made my buck, time to head out. You're one of a kind, buddy. - Take care, alright. - Nice to see you again! Pop by sometime. Sure thing, Sarge! Ana! Take care! That guy's got a way with women, huh. But we got lucky with Mando, right? If not for him, we wouldn't have met. By the way, I can't make it tonight. Got to rise and shine early tomorrow, school affair. No worries, it's cool. You sure? Yeah, no sweat. I'll make it up to you. Good evening, Sir! How are you? What matters is we're good now, right? If you've got an issue, - call the cops on him. - Ma'am, here's the receipt. Alright, ma, I gotta run. My ride's here. Bye! Oh my gosh, Hon! - It's driving me nuts! - Good afternoon, ma'am. What's so "good" about this afternoon? This is so frustrating! Didn't you see what they did? - Yeah, I saw. - They trash-talked me. They can't see all the effort I put in, everything I do for them, always providing aid. - You're right, you're right. - It's so infuriating! I get it! Just take a deep breath. Can't they see I'm the one feeding them all the time?! Whenever they need food! Who's there during the relief? Who? Me! I'm always there! When they need school supplies, I'm there. - Exactly. - The nerve of those people! After which they belittle me like that. Can't they... Ugh, I'm so stressed out! Where's my drink, what's taking so long?! Get her drink, please! Hurry up! I'm always there for them! Aren't some of them still indebted to you? - It's so annoying! - Yes. Ugh! I'm so stressed out. I really am! Gosh! My-- My drink, what's the delay?! Come on! This is too much, - it's been forever! - Relax. No! Cordapio, get my cigarettes! They're getting on my nerves, Hon. So frustrating! I need to call my amiga. Isn't it embarrassing! You know... I can't... I won't forgive them! What they're doing to me, just no! Hello? Sis! Did you see what they did? They embarrassed me! Don't they realize I'm the one funding them? For everything! Right? What's up with Madam? - They're belittling me too much! - Just ignore them. It's not worth the headache. That Roberta, she's too much with her criticism! By the way, my colonel friends are coming over later. I'm stressed, Mars! I might come over to your place later. Yeah, I'll see you! Hey, you need to gather influential people to be with us because I can't accept what they're doing to me! Hon, I'm leaving! I'll... be there. Ma! I'll start the rice. Alright, dear. I'll be right there. I'll cook, just a sec, okay? - Sure. - I'm done here. Let's go. Stephen. Oh, alright, cool name. Waiter! Hey waiter, table seven over here. - Check. - Check. - Call. - Call. - Call. - Call. - All in. - All in. Call, sir? Call for all in, sir. - All in. - Call for the all in. Sir? Call? - All in. - Matching the all in. Show cards, please. Flush. Show, please. Flush wins. Okay. Thank you, Lord! You're on a roll, huh? Unlucky! Come with me, just this once. I've wanted to get to know you for so long. Alright, have fun over there. Just for a while. So crowded yet nothing's paying off. Give me a cigarette. Just a sec. I've been coming here for ages. Come on. I'm sorry sir. Come on. There are a lot-- No, really, please. Hurry up. I still have work to do. Buddy! - Hey! - What are you up to, Warden? You're being a bit... Leave the staff alone, man. You're a bit handsy, huh? Just inviting her to have fun. I get it, but if they're not into it, back off. No means no, right? She was into it! What are you on about?! - Dude. - Mind your own business, okay? I'm not meddling, I'm just saying... I told you to butt out! Relax, man! You bastard, I know you! Asshole! Sir, sir, calm down! - Damn you! - Stop it, Sir! Don't you dare touch the women here! Our girls? You son of a... - Enough already, okay? - Let go of me! Get the hell out of here! I'll end you! - Damn it! - Don't even try it. You alright? Damn... Sorry, sorry, everyone, guests. My apologies! Let's keep the party going. - Sorry, sorry. - No problem. Old acquaintance. He's a moron. Alright. Bottoms up! Guys, rock and roll. Come on! Ana! Ana! Wow. You know, you shouldn't have done that. He disrespected you. That's a no-go for me, okay? The guy was wasted! Even so, you shouldn't be treated like that. Why? Have you grown numb to it? Seriously? Isn't this our line of business? You're the manager, customers shouldn't disrespect you. I know that, but you're a stubborn little baby, huh? What's your problem? Why is it my fault that he approached me? Damn it. Wait a sec... Why... do you like being objectified? Random men touching you... Do you think I want this? Do you think I enjoy this? This? All these comforts I provided for you? Have you forgotten? I took you in, chewed up my dignity for you, and this is how you repay me? Isn't this how all of you see me anyway? Ana! I'm so sorry! Sorry, sorry! My bad, Ana! I didn't mean it. It was an accident. I didn't want to hurt you. No, no. I didn't mean it. It won't happen again. It won't happen again. I can't take this anymore! Why don't you get it? Why won't you understand? You prefer being treated like trash? Is that it? Being degraded! You enjoy it! Enough! That's it! Stop! Stop it! Your lucky charm is quite chatty, huh? Just look at that! A whispering lucky charm, really? Give it a blow. Damn, he even knows how to blow. That's set then. What a lucky charm, where did you even get that? I'll get back with this deck. We'll see. Oh? You won't win this time. You two sure are confident. - Here it comes! - Here it comes! - One more! - Just one more! There! Royal! Ooh, a pair! Royal flush! Tough luck. Pair! Nice hand... Pay up. Shuffle it in front of them, or they'll accuse us of cheating. Pay first, then we shuffle. You're trying to con us. Shuffle it. Massage my back. I'm going all in. Alright. Slow down a bit. I expect a tip from that. Let's go while luck's on my side. I'll bounce back. Bro, what's the problem? No, just a sec. But there's just one. He's drinking. Damn it... Shit! - Hey, what happened to him? - Where's he going? Ask him. Okay. It's done for. Just remember, I get ten percent. What? Hold on, hold on! Ben! Hey, how are you? Why are you here? Nancy? She's long gone, almost a year. Have you heard from Mando? Ever since your squabble, he left. Do you know where they moved? Sorry, dude, I don't. Wait a sec. Hello! Yes, bro. Just remember, ten percent for me. Yes. You bastard, you screwed me over! Babe, babe, hold on! Honey! You know, man, if I knew a way to make quick money... There's a trend now, they buy sex videos, if you have any. Love! Trust me, I got this for both of us. Here, fifteen grand just so you could bounce back. - Sure, boss. - Just make sure you'll pay. Here! This one'll play. Ben, how could you do that? Ben? Talk to me! Damn it! Shit! Come on, we're late, let's get in! Hurry up! Alright then, come on. Sir, let's go! Just go straight, let's follow them. Dude, thanks. Let's go. Wait, by the way. Is he there? We're going in. Thanks! Damn you! You bastard! Jerk! You asshole! Son of a bitch! Stop it! Enough, Ben! Damn it, Mando! We're friends, aren't we? What the hell are you doing? If not for me, you'd be nowhere! Damn you, Mando! Screw you! Shit! Don't you have anything to say? You're not even going to make it up to me? You're not going to help? Mando! - Ben! - Ana! Ben, why are you here? Why not? Are you with Sarge now? Huh? - Ben! - Are you two together? Please, just leave! Sarge can't see you here! So, my suspicions were right? You and Sarge. Get out of here! Leave me alone. Uh, it's... you're here. Been a while, hasn't it? What do you need? Never mind. I was leaving anyway. Ben. Maybe have a drink? Karaoke? My treat. No, I should be going. Alright then. Take care, Ben. Why's that asshole ex of yours here? Huh? I have no idea! Oh, so you don't know? I bet you called him over. Does it look like I have "idiot" written on my forehead? Hey, I'm talking to you! You have no shame, in front of all these people! Let's talk at home. Alright, alright, alright. Let's go home. You-- I can't talk to you anymore, that's your problem. I was just asking a question? - Huh? - What's your problem, huh? Why can't you give me a straight answer? You never understand! I'm just asking! Why are you mad? Because you're not even listening! Then what's that jerk doing there? Enough! It's the same shit, over and over! No, just answer me. - What's that asshole doing there? - Stop it, enough! Seriously? You called him, right? What? - Huh? - I didn't call him. - I don't know anything about it! - You called him! Oh, so you miss him now? - Did you, did you call him? - Enough already! Did you, did you call him? Ana! Never turn your back on me when I'm talking to you! - What's your problem? - Don't even— - Are you for real? - Look, I'm right here, okay? You're getting really brave now! You're something else. What? Huh? What? Who do you think you are? Wanna take me on? You think you can take me? Enough! - I really don't know anything about it! - You think you can play me? I really don't know anything about it! You want to go back to your asshole ex? Is that so? Huh? What? Does he hit you like this? I saved you from your miserable life. Bitch! - I took you in. - Stop it! I gave you everything. Everything you have! Please stop. You owe me your life! Enough! What, do you want it harder? Here, here. Ben. Ben. Hurry, hurry. Let's get out of here. Come with me. Let's get away and start a new life. Let's go! Charlie! Charlie! Come here! Go to my office, there are three folders on my desk... in the drawer, three of them. They're labeled Dela Peña, Go, and Cruz. Bring me Cruz's. Okay, hurry up. Hurry up! I have a meeting, Charlie! Run, Charlie! Hello! Yeah, man. Just fool around with them. Yeah, yeah. No problem, I'm on my way. Alright. Charlie, what's taking so long? Boss? I really can't find it! Are you blind? I'm gonna be late! Can't trust you with anything simple, man! Ben, you need to leave. No, I'm not leaving. Come with me. Come with me. No, just leave me, Ben. Please, come with me. Ben, he'll kill you! No, he won't kill me. - Ben! - He won't kill me. I got this, I got this, let's go! Let's go! Come on, come on! Come on! Hey! Here, here. Hide, hide. Ma'am, what are you doing there? Ma'am! Let's go! Hurry, hurry! Shit! - Run! - Damn you! Ana, you bitch! Run! Run! Here! Here!
