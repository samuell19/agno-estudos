Oh, and then when she finds the dry daisy in the safety deposit box, man, that really floored me. Now for the hard part. Waiting for the next book. Offer to buy. Butter sticks. Hey! How's the house painting going? Sorry I can't be there to help. You know I want to be, but with the farm I... Don't worry about it. That's what Rob's college buddies are for. Sounds fair. So, how does it feel to be a homeowner? Amazing! I am just loving the extra space. I mean, what a change from our tiny apartment. It's a big step. You'll have to give me a tour soon. Actually, that's why I'm calling. We're planning a little housewarming tonight at our place. So if you're not busy reading another one of your mystery novels... I'll be there. I'm so happy you're home. There's no way I could imagine settling down somewhere without you nearby. It's good to be back. So I'll see you later? I'm thinking seven? Wouldn't miss it. Thirteen new orders! Not bad. No rest for the wicked, I guess. Thank you Mrs. Sharp. Wow, even more than last week. Things are picking up. Hey, how was that lotion for the baby's eczema? Worked like you said. You got to let me pay you for that one. Not a chance. You could leave a review, though. You got it. Thanks. Take care! "Your life will unfold like the bloom on a rose." Man, those real estate brokers! Enjoy. Sorry I'm late! I didn't get home from poker night till after midnight. Poker night, huh? Uh huh. You should come with me next week. Ah, no, thank you. I will pass. Okay, what's with the tone? No tone! There was definitely judgement. I just remember when your Saturday nights were spent knitting, that's all. Knitting was never so lucrative. Hey, this one looks new. Uh huh. Hmmm... Lavender? With just a hint of sage. Mom! Darling, it's wonderful to have you back. Isn't that right, Dex? Hey, yeah. Looks like you've settled in nicely at the farm already. Uh huh. And don't let that Jackson Flynt talk you into selling. Okay? There's no fear of that happening. Kallie, has Dex told you he just started teaching at Willow High School. Yes, I heard through the grapevine, but, yeah, that's wonderful. Thank you. You've always been good with kids. Remember that summer when the two of you were camp counselors together? Made a great team. You two should get together to catch up. Kallie's free anytime. You know we should get together. It's been too long. How about you stop by the school sometime? I can show you our old lockers. Oh no. Are all my stickers still inside? Oh, you'd be surprised! And we'll also need new stock at the spa. - Already? - Yes. You know the one with collagen for anti-aging? It's flying off my shelves. I can't believe you kept this to yourself for so long, Caroline. I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh really. - Thank you Kallie. - Thank you! Dex is so sweet. Oh great. Alison Fletcher's here. Hey Alison. I have great news. Rural Heartbeat, Willow's hip and trendy agriculture magazine, wants to do a story on you. I don't think your readers would find me all that fascinating. Former horse jumping competitor saves local farm. What's more newsworthy than that? That's not what happened. Caroline was selling and I was buying. Journalistic license. Sorry, Alison. Just not interested. Well, at least follow the magazine on your social. I know you want to. Kallie, Dr. Grant's ready for Tia now. Okay. What did she eat? Hmm... What doesn't she eat? I think she might have gotten into something in the barn next door. Maybe she's just trying to live up to her name. Tiamat? The goddess also affectionately known as 'chaos monster'. I minored in history in college. You're an interesting man, Dr. Grant. Yeah, the name fits a little too well. I can't get her to stop. She's a pro at opening gates. Try baking soda in her diet. It should help with digestion whenever she gets into something she shouldn't. Oh, thanks for the tip. It will probably save us quite a few trips in to see you. That's a shame. Maybe next time I'll keep my home remedies to myself. Well, thank you. You made it! Sorry I'm late. This is beautiful. You're forgiven. And it's so nice to see you out of your farm clothes for a change. I even wore heels for you. Oh! Good thing! This an intimate house warming party. Why is it just me and your realtor? No one else is coming, are they? Not exactly. You told me this was a housewarming party, not a set-up. It is. Come on. I'll give you the tour before dinner. "My heart is full of purpose now that it beats for you. If only I was near to you, my dear, I would see the sun brighter and the moon cast its silvery spell on our future days. I have felt by you a closeness of spirit never before shared, a pulse that has never so quickened, a love that is never stirred so in the depths of my soul." Put the face away. I need your help. I'm just going to say, Kyle is a really great guy and you should have given him a chance. I'm sure I'll regret not marrying him and having a dozen babies. Hey, what do you make of this? "A love that has never stirred so..." A love that has never stirred... Am I following you? This is it! "Famous Love Letters of the Sea from Pirate Blye to Lady Johanna 1756". Exactly. It's a famous historical love letter. Where did you get it? My mailbox. Lucky girl. Who sent them? No idea. No signature or return address on either. What do you think it means? That somebody got the wrong mailbox. I'm awake, Henry! Look. If this is about your offer... It's not. I came to bring you this. Looks like some things your mom left behind. Thank you. How's she doing, with the move and all? Mom? Ah... She's great. New apartment, new job, new hair. New life. Oh well, good for her. Thanks for dropping this off. You're welcome. Miss you dad. ♪ [jazzy music starts] Not working today? Just an extended lunch break. Your mom mentioned a vintage LP that Rob might like for our anniversary. Speaking of vintage... The new owner found some things you left behind at the house. Oh. Ah... Nothing important. I received another one. Another what? This one feels different, but it's definitely still some kind of love letter. "I while away the hours till our hearts are at one again. A day is a year in your absence. When the clocks chime in town, my heart leaps out and strides upon the reverberations of each ring. If only to fly across the ages and arrive at our meeting once more." Another historical love letter. And this one is definitely addressed to you. Perhaps you have a secret admirer. Do I want a secret admirer? Yes! Still no clue on who's sending them? Someone with a lot of time on their hands? Whatever happened to texting, right? Historically, love letters were the only way to convey feelings of passion and love. Maybe they're making a comeback like... print books and vinyl records. But these aren't even new letters, meant for me. Maybe there's a deeper meaning, like a less obvious reason you're receiving them. There is a common theme. See? Each of these talks about a shared past. About feelings developing and changing over time. So, maybe it's someone you've known awhile? Someone from your past? Ah hah! I have no idea what that means. But I do like the look on your face. It means it's time to compare some handwriting. Remember. There could be a pop quiz on this stuff any day. I'm not saying tomorrow is that day, but I'm also not saying it isn't. Hey, Kallie. Whatcha doing here? You know, I always loved chemistry class. I wish more of my students thought that way. Why would they not? Science is the study of life's mysteries. Well, this is a nice surprise. Well, you know, the other day at the market... I said I'd stop by. Ah, yes. Our mother's endless matchmaking attempts. Yes, they are ridiculous. But I also think it would be great... To catch up. Oh? I thought so too. So...? Coffee. Would you like to grab a coffee this weekend? Actually craving milkshakes instead. Why don't we have lunch at Maeve's on Saturday? Meet you at noon? It's a date. So... What are you going to wear? Get out of here wise guy. Study! What am I going to wear? "When such a humble being does not know the power of her own beauty, that power is all that more brilliant to all that behold her. I feel a danger of being overcome when you enter the room..." So women like being told they're dangerous. Do you want something? Just wondering if you'd given more thought to my offer? You keep avoiding the conversation. Not avoiding it. Just hoping you'll take a hint? Is this what you really want? Staying cooped up in that house, tending goats? I mean, you've got a university degree. With my offer, you could have so much more. I had it all once. It was taken away. So you'll excuse me if I hold onto the little that I have left. I can understand that. You know, a friend once told me letting go is not the hard part, it's the holding on. So what were you reading to, what is it, Cleo or Tia... Just now? Nothing. Come on! Spit it out or I'll keep asking you about selling up here. A love letter. To you? That's surprising? Nah. Just seems... Old fashioned. It's more romantic than online dating. Just as potentially dangerous. Come on, you're not freaked out about some dude lurking around? Delivering anonymous letters. I am now! But you're also intrigued? I do love a mystery. 'Darkness in Death'. Hmm. Hey, Sahara! Shhhh! How's it going? I'm sorry. You can't have 'Darkness in Death'. It's on reserve for Kallie. Look, I'll tell you what, I'll do you a favor. How about I read this book quickly, and then just bring it to her. She lives right next door. What? Seriously? Come on, Sahara. I just want to read one book in this series that she hasn't spoiled for me by recounting the twist to those goats. Fine. But read fast. You got it. Have you read these? They're really good. It's not my genre. Appreciate ya. Hmmm... ♪ [groovy music playing] Hey, darlin'. Sweet! Did you know Jackson wanted to buy the entire farm? My lot included? The entire farm wasn't for sale. I told you. I'd keep your grandmother's house and the acres behind it for you. Why, is he giving you a hard time? Not exactly. He's acting like I'm the annoying one for holding out. Pay him no mind. And you know, he's not all bad. I heard he's even offered to carry on our Sharp family tradition and host the annual town fair and barn dance at the farm. Oh, that was decent of him. I guess. Do you know what he wants the land for, though? I mean, if he wants to raise crops, he's going to have to hire a few hands. Let's not talk about crops. Sahara tells me you've got a date this weekend? Since when are you and Sahara in cahoots? We just both missed you when you were away at school, that's all. And you know, since her mother died I've kinda... Stepped into an honorary 'mom' role. I like that. Anyway, it's no big deal. Dex and I are going to grab lunch at Maeve's. When? As if I would tell you that, so you can what? Come by and take photos? Might make for some good wedding day footage. Don't forget, I still have pictures from your junior high school dance. A full head retainer shot never ever gets old. Ha ha.

I forgot to put it on the reserved shelf and Jackson had a compelling argument. 'Darkness in Death' came in? That man has messed with the wrong mystery reader. You and Jackson have a lot in common. Do you want your coffee or not? Desperately. Huh. Definitely more famous historical ones. But these ones have a nature theme. Metaphors, comparisons to life at sea. Yeah... I think maybe it's Dr. Grant. Your vet? My goats' vet, but yeah. What does that have to do with the sea? He loves to sail. I saw a picture of him with his sailboat in his office. Well, too bad you're not a fan of water. It could still be Dex, though.

Anything I can do to help? You want to help? Can't a person be neighborly? All right. I could use some help in the kitchen. The kitchen? So, where did the name Goddess Goats come from anyway? Well, it was rumored that Cleopatra used goat's milk in her beauty regime. So, my grandma always had one goat named 'Cleo' in her honor. Okay! These are your grandmother's recipes. I've tweaked them. Added a few things, but yeah. My mother had eczema as a child so my grandmother put goat's milk in the bath and it really helped. Hmm... So she started making products for friends and neighbors. So farming's been in your family for generations? Five generations were raised in the house that you're living in. My grandmother moved over here when my parents got married. Look, I didn't mean to acquire your childhood home. Your mom said... I like living here. I actually renovated this place to make it a shared space for the farm workers with... My dad. You two were close? We were. Soaps are ready. Good timing, though, huh. Well there you are. Well, uh, I should get going. Well, thank you for your help today. Oh, you know, I almost forgot... I ah, intercepted your book reservation. And man, this is good. You know, I always wanted to be a writer, but turns out I was never any good with words, so... here you go. I should totally spoil the plot for you. Don't you dare. I couldn't if I wanted to. I felt guilty even taking it from the library, so I haven't read it yet. I'm going to go. Yeah. Well... Umm... Thanks again. Anytime. "I lie awake amongst my bed clothes, afraid to sleep, afraid to dream for fear it might stir the love that beats mercilessly against my heart's walls. Walls that are quickly dissolving, running to the river that flows into rapids and rushes to the falls, that fall and fall in a never ceasing wall. Always and forever, I ache for you. You have won me and I am ever yours." That's the thirteenth letter I've received. Where does this one fit among the others? I don't know. It's not the historical theme. It's not nautical. So, it could be either of the two men? Or someone completely different. Oh... Hmmm... Afraid to sleep, afraid to dream... No clues on the dates, huh? Uh uh. The dates weren't helpful at all. I guess, I guess I'm just no closer to solving the mystery. But you're having fun though, right? I am. I always wanted to be a writer, but, uh, turns out I was never any good with words, so... The weirdest thing happened today. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to overhear your conversation, but you're Kallie Sharp, right? Uh huh. I'm Alison Fletcher, senior editor and head journalist of Rural Heartbeat Magazine. Listen, I'd love to do a story on you for our upcoming issue. On... On my skin care line? Um, no. This love letter thing you two were talking about. It's fascinating. Oh, thank you, but... I'm not comfortable featuring my personal life in a magazine. What if I agreed to six months of free advertising for your Goddess Goats brand? Just give us a sec. You can't seriously be considering this? You don't think it's a good idea? You're just usually so private. I know, but this advertising space is so tempting. I could never afford it. Me again. Hi. I'll need an answer by tomorrow morning if we're going to make next week's edition. Rural Heartbeat, please hold... Rural Heartbeat, how may I direct your call? One moment please. Hi! You made it!

So, these mysterious love letters, they just started showing up? Yeah. Um... Thirteen so far. All famous historical love letters from statesmen, poets. Even pirates. And how does it make you feel when a new one shows up in your mailbox? Uh... It's... It's kinda fun to know someone's thinking about me. And you have no idea who's sending them to you? I have a few clues. Well, let's see if this article helps to solve the mystery. Maybe toss the letters into the air? See what happens. Oh.

My gut tells me this could blow up any second. You're just hungry. I'll get you a Danish. Tia! Tia! Whoa there! I can't find Tia. Everyone else is accounted for, but she's got out again. Tia!

Camp Saddleback... Some kind of riding school? Yeah, it's a therapeutic riding camp for kids, actually. That's my sister Jane, my younger sister. She loved to ride. I'm sorry. The riding camp was her idea and, uh... That's why you need my land too. Well it was the plan. The farm is my home. I wasn't thrilled about my mom trying to sell any part of it. I'm happy it's in good hands, but... You have you own business, I get it. So, any more... letters? You read the article? I may have glanced at it. Well now the whole town is talking about it. I'm not sure it was worth the free advertising. Well, has it convinced your mystery man to reveal himself? Not yet. Too bad. Not really. I think I'm ready for this whole thing to be behind me, actually. I thought you were having fun dating Dex and Dr. Grant. I had more fun yesterday making products with you. Well then those men really need to step up their game. I should get her back where she belongs. Yeah, right, uh... Thanks... Again. She's welcome to visit anytime. Going with email now? Oh boy. It's none of my business. Do you want to go somewhere with me? Kallie, this is Rocket and Dash. They're beautiful. They are retired competition horses. The owner is shutting the place down and thinking of selling it. Were you planning on buying them for the riding camp? I was thinking about it. Trying to find a way to make it work. Is this where you used to train? What? I have a computer. Yeah. This was my training camp. And this was my coach. Good to see you, son. Mr. Fisher, this is my friend Kallie Sharp. Oh... Very nice to meet you. Beautiful ranch. Magnificent horses. Well, they really used to be something. Getting old now. Like the rest of us. I have a grocery store client. I need to take this. Excuse me. What happened to him? Why did he stop competing? Oh, those are questions for him, darlin'. You're not going to help a girl out, huh? Well, I will say this. He was the best in his class and that's not being biased. He could have gone pro. Why didn't he? Well, I guess there are more important things in life. So, what do you think? Want to go for a ride? Can we? Would that be all right? I'd be insulted if you didn't. Looks like you know what you're doing. It's not my first time. Have you done some riding before? Yeah. My dad and I used to ride horses at the farm before he got sick. So... I'm really looking forward to this. Well, wait until you see what these girls can do. Just try and keep up. ♪ [uplifting music] You must have spent a lot of time here, as a kid? I practically lived here. So when did you start training and competing? I was... four... Yeah, four years old. - Wow! - Uh huh. So... Why did you stop? Well, after my parents died, it was just me and Jane. It didn't seem to matter as much to me anymore. You took care of your sister? We took care of each other. How old were you? Nineteen. That must have been hard. Well, you know, Mr. Fisher? He was always there if we needed him. He's always been like a second father to me. It'll be hard to see this place close. Well, it's time for the Fishers to retire. I get it. But, what about your business? Based on the amount of product I made, I take it things are going well? Yeah, better than expected. I can't keep up with the online orders. But I guess that's not really what you want to hear. No, it doesn't really help my case, but, uh... I'm happy for you. And it's not that horrible having you next door. Gee, thanks! I just got a swift text from Kallie. I think she's in love. Oh! With which one? Oh my! A doctor for a son in law would be so wonderful. But Dex is such a charmer. It's neither of them. Well who then? Jackson. Jackson Flynt? Uh huh. Fate has a funny way of meddling in people's lives. No. That was us. We did that. Well, either way, things worked out for the best. So I shouldn't deliver the last letter now, right? Oh no no no. We have to finish what we started. Fourteen letters. She has to receive them all. Still not going to tell me why though are you? No. Bye. How can I help you. Caught you, buddy.

At least if she has her own life, she can't meddle in mine. ♪ [fast, upbeat music starts] Hi everyone! Hope everyone's having a great time. As we all know, there's been quite a little mystery buzzing around town the last few weeks. Kallie's love letters have made an exciting topic of conversation. But I think it's time we solve this little mystery. What do y'all think? What do we do? Sneak out now while we still have the chance? I thought it was over. I thought it was. Who is our mysterious love letter sender? Dex? Dr. Grant? Come on now. Don't be shy. Or maybe there's another gentleman, a neighbor even, putting his heart on the page. It was us sending the letters. Well... Mystery solved. Mom... I'm not entirely surprised that you're behind this. But Sahara? You were in on this? Darlin'... It wasn't supposed to go this far. How was it supposed to go? We just wanted you to get away from the farm more. You know, explore mysteries in your own life. Possibly fall in love. Get away from the farm? The way you have? I had no choice but to move on. Life doesn't always give you the option. I loved your father and I lost him far too soon. I'm just... Making the best I can of things the only way I know how. By selling the farm? Dad's farm. And leaving behind all our memories? I didn't leave any memories behind. I took them with me. All the important things are still right here. Well, I'm glad you got to decide for yourself what to take and what to leave. Kallie! Wait! I got it. Hey, wait up. Kallie! I just want to go home. Look, at least all this is really over now. It's over. I was just humiliated in front of the whole town. Not the whole town. How could they do this to me? I did an interview... This is mortifying. And Dex and Grant were probably so confused. Dex and Grant were having as much fun as you were. They enjoyed the attention. I wouldn't worry about them. Hey. Okay? Look, Sahara told me your mom and her were just trying to help because they love you. Jackson... Did you know about this? I caught Sahara trying to deliver the final letter last night. I wanted to know who it was so I camped out by your mailbox. And you didn't think to share this knowledge with me? Look, I didn't think it was my place. I thought we were friends. Well, we are. We're more than that. You should have told me. They were going to and they said they weren't going to send any more letters. Look, you need to know how lucky you are to have people who care so much about you. People who would go to those, albeit crazy lengths, to see you find happiness. I was happy! My quiet, simple, predictable life suited me just fine. You were probably just hoping I'd fall in love so I would sell you my land, while I was whisked away to my happily ever after with Dex or Dr. Grant. Look no. I was hoping you'd fall in love. That parts true... And stupid me! I actually hoped it was you! Kallie, come on. Kallie, come on. Come on, just... Just hear me out for a second. Just hear...

It was all my idea. Well we both thought... Maybe it was time for you to start considering a relationship. In hindsight, we realize it wasn't our place to decide that. I just worry about you, darlin'. You lost your father, the farm... I'm fine, mom. I'm happy... I was happy too, a long time ago. Or at least I thought I was... Until these same letters made me open myself up to the possibility of being even happier. What do you mean? There are a few things your father and I never told you. Truth is... I was, um, engaged to someone else when I fell in love with your father. Your father and I had gone to school together and we'd been great friends. I never knew there was more to it... For him. Um, when he heard through town of my engagement, he knew it was speak now or forever hold your peace. Well, he was, he was never great with words, so he sent me a historical love letter for every one of the fourteen days leading up to the wedding, hoping that I'd change my mind. And consider his love instead. And it worked? Well, you're here, aren't you darlin'? Calling off the wedding wasn't easy, but after I realized how your father felt about me and how those words had just poured over me, I... I realized I had to take a chance. It was the best decision of my life. Why didn't you tell me any of this? It was our secret. Our love story. But after losing your father I realized that it was time to share his letters with you. I never let go of the pieces of the past that really mattered, Kallie. And I had hoped that, in his own way, your father might inspire you to find love too. And I turned it into a mystery to solve. Like any passionate mystery novel reader would. Well, I will truly be alone with my books now. I doubt any man in town would date me. I think Jackson might be up for it. No, I... I messed that one up all on my own. There is definitely a real connection between you two. Don't give up yet. After all, your dad didn't and I was about to walk down the aisle with somebody else. Hey, Mr. Fisher. Yeah, I know... I just don't think it's going to work this time. Go ahead and sell. No, I understand. Thanks. Hey. Any of my goats in here? Do you need something? The other night, I was upset... It was nothing. Just a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding? You mentioned... Falling in love... I was wrong. You weren't. Look, Kallie... I got caught up in something. But that's over now. Thought I might see you here today. Yeah, I thought I'd go out for one last ride. Hmm... Your girl's not with you? She's not my girl. But you want her to be. So what's the problem? It's complicated. Well, what relationship isn't? All I know is that ever since your parents died... And Jane... You haven't opened yourself up to anyone. You've guarded your heart and I understood that. But I never gave up hope that someone might break through those fences of yours one day. Kallie and I were just friends. You brought her here. And that means something. Even if you won't admit it.

You let your pride get in the way of what he was trying to tell you. He put himself out there. That means something. Not any more. You just need to show him that the connection was real for you too. How do I do that? When Rob and I were dating we would always go to the bakery and share a chocolate coffee muffin. He always gave me the top and he ate the bottom. I thought it was a match made in heaven. The top of the muffin is the best part and here was a guy that preferred the bottom. Flash forward a year and a wedding later, I learned he actually loves the top of the muffin. He was giving me the best part because he knew it was the best part. He sacrificed something he cared about for me! Thank you! You are a genius. Just give me a second, son. Hey, Kallie. Nice to see you! No Jackson? He doesn't know I'm here. I want to surprise him with something, but... I need your help. Well, anything, darlin'. For that boy, anything at all. "Where refuge from lightning sparked an undeniable connection, a new mystery begins." Refuge from lightning? "Where our lands meet, the mystery continues. A joining of lives creates an unexpected joining of futures." "Where horses graze the mystery can finally be solved with open minds and open hearts." You solved my mystery. You bought the horses? Not exactly. They're on loan until you can buy them from Mr. Fisher. You... You did that for me? Well, I couldn't let Rocket and Dash go to somebody else. They belong here. Camp Saddleback is a really wonderful idea. But this is your land. And what about your business? I have more than enough space. I'll keep the goat pen and the gardens... And the rest... Is yours. This is your home. And it always will be. What's this? Letters are what caught your attention. So, I wrote you one. No more letters. I just want you. You know a friend once told me that the hard part is holding on. You helped me realize that by not letting go, I would only ever be half happy. No. I was... I was closed off for a long time. It was hard for me to tell you how I felt for you. But I don't care about your land, Kallie. I care about you. I'm in love with you. And I want to make you happy the whole way down. I'm in love with you, too. ♪ And there's a smile on my face ♪ ♪ My heart's racing and pacing ♪ Baby I can't stop this feeling no no ♪ ♪ You got me believing ♪ And it's all you yeah ♪ All you baby ♪ And it's all you yeah ♪ All you baby ♪ And it's all you ♪ Yeah you
