I'll tell you the incredible story of Cinéman. Cinéman, first, is me. A few months ago, I still taught math in Montreuil-sous-Bois. Before Cinéman, my name was Régis Deloux. Cinéman is 73 Oscars in Hollywood, 40 Palmes d'Or in Cannes... As for Caesars, I've lost count. What Neil Armstrong did in the 20th century with the moon, I did 40 years later with cinema, by being the first man to appear in a film. I was never interested in cinema, apart from actresses. Like everyone. My priority lay in math, which I taught for 12 years. But the moment has come to introduce Viviane. Viviane and I got married a few months ago. I remember when I asked her hand in marriage... in a film in 1921, the most beautiful day of my life. For her, not only did I reach the moon... but I became the moon. We have a son, Cinéboy. We also have a dog, Cinédog. Lay, Cinédog. And a cat, Cinécat. Believe me, cinema is more beautiful than life. I only come back exceptionally among you and believe me, when it's the case, I don't go unnoticed. Oh! Any messages, Serge? Ah, Mr. Cinéman! Yes, of course. Mr. Jean-Claude Dusse says that he's blocked in Val d'Isère. OK. Nothing else? Yes, I'm looking. How is Mr. Dark Vador? Very stingy. Don't count on him to buy a coffee. -A call from Harry Potter. -Again? From inspector Harry and Lara Croft. She's obsessed! Mr. Cinéman! Mrs. Deneuve is waiting for you in a 1980s film. She can wait. -Do you want to order or wait? -I'll wait. May I? Hold on a moment. -Yes? -What are you doing? Sleeping. How? Listen, Cathy. We have a meeting tomorrow. No! I can't speak, I'm on the line with Robocop. What? I'll call you back. Hello? Hello? Sorry, Robo, I was with Cathy. I think she's jealous of Viviane. No, I'm not with Amélie Poulain. It was one night, I was drunk. Do you know who Amélie is with? No, he's finished. With Shrek's brother. Moi, je traîne dans le désert Depuis plus de 28 jours Et déjà quelques mirages Me disent de faire demi-tour La fée des neiges me suit Tapant sur son tambour Les fantômes du syndicat Les marchands de certitudes Se sont glissés jusqu'à ma dune Reprochant mon attitude C'est pas très populaire Le goût de la solitude Quand t'es dans le désert Depuis trop longtemps Tu te demandes à qui ça sert Toutes les règles un peu truquées du jeu Qu'on veut te faire jouer Les yeux bandés Tous les rapaces du pouvoir Menés par un gros clown sinistre Plongent vers moi sur la musique D'un piètre accordéoniste J'rois pas qu'ils viennent me parler Des joies de la vie d'artiste De l'autre côté voilà Caïn Toujours aussi lunatique Son œil est rempli de sable Et sa bouche pleine de verdicts Il trône dans un cimetière De vieilles pelles mécaniques Quand t'es dans le désert Depuis trop longtemps, la, la, la Tu te demandes à qui ça sert Toutes les règles un peu truquées Du jeu qu'on veut te faire jouer Les yeux bandés Les gens disent que les poètes Finissent tous trafiquants d'armes On est cinquante millions de poètes C'est ça qui doit faire notre charme Sur une lune de Saturne Mon perroquet sonne l'alarme C'est drôle Mais tout le monde s'en fout Vendredi tombant de nulle part Ya Robinson solitaire Qui me dit : ''Je trouve plus mon île Vous n'auriez pas vu la mer ?'' Va falloir que je lui parle Du thermonucléaire Quand t'es dans le désert Depuis trop longtemps Tu te demandes à qui ça sert Toutes les règles un peu truquées Du jeu qu'on veut te faire jouer Les yeux bandés Quand t'es dans le désert Depuis trop longtemps, la, la, la Tu te demandes à qui ça sert Les yeux bandés Hier, un homme est venu vers moi D'une démarche un peu traînante Il m'a dit : "T'as tenu combien de jours ?" Je lui ai répondu : "Bientôt 30" A few months earlier... -What color is my bag, Mamesse? -Yellow. -Color of? -Corrected copies. Corrected copies. 12 years I've been teaching here, I've never seen that. I thought I was teaching advanced math, but... nothing much advanced here. I assure you, nothing at all advanced. So, distribution. Ah! Mamesse... The Balzac of math. 17 pages. There's everything, Mamesse. Blood, action... Sex. Everything. Except math. That's volume one. I'll wait for volume two, impatiently. I gave you 2 out of 20. Shall I give it back? No. I'll put it where it came from. That's easier. Combourieux! Oh là là! Do you know how to walk? Yes. And breathe? Yes. And piss? Please! I thought you didn't know how to do anything. Here, keep it preciously. You never know, you might need it. Ah yes, Fabienne. I didn't give you a grade. I didn't want to handicap your average. But the notion of continuity isn't really assimilated. Huh? A continued function is smooth... OK? If you have problems, come and speak to me on Facebook. De Groot! Is he here, De Groot? Physically, I mean. Intellectually, he hasn't been with us for a while. I'm here. Yes, he's here, De Groot. I have your copy. I'm walking on De Groot's copy. Left foot, it's a good luck charm. OK... my God... I'll give you one more point. There is one intelligent thing there. My footprint. To sum up, we absolutely need, this year, 40% more success in upper schools. The Education Board is very attentive to our performances. That said... I'd like to turn to Mr. Deloux. We have a little problem. Nothing serious. It doesn't question your teaching ability. But you're here to encourage our students. Not to demotivate them from the first trimester with bad grades. Mr. Coq was an ex-failed biology teacher. He wrote a thesis on frogs' cerebral systems. According to him, the most intelligent species after man. If I may, Mr. Principal, psychology has never been Mr. Deloux's strong point. Shh, tut, tut, tut... Every year, I get five students in to university. 10 to central. Math demands military preparation. Without discipline, nothing. I'm at the head of an elite commando. I was a bit hard with you, true. But I receive your students in little pieces. -They confide in me. -That's your problem, Sidonie. Society won't give them a gift. They're still very fragile. Go gently. In fact, something is nagging at me. Go on, I'm listening. Do you appreciate me, physically? Seriously? Not at all. That hurts. Every Saturday, I dined with a woman I met online. In life, I was Régis Deloux, but online, I operated under the name of Viking 14. Yes, I should have put my real photo on Meetic. But we've been chatting for two years. We're entering the flirting phase... of our relationship. A demanding phase. Passionate. Here. It's for you. Banana-shaped earrings. They make a noise when you press them. You're crazy. I won't draw a picture for you, you drive me crazy. It's easy. I'll be honest with you... Tut, tut... do you know Marc Lavoine? The philosopher? You have revolver eyes. Revolver, Maud. Are you kidding? You smell like patchouli. You wear moccasins. You have so much dandruff it looks like snow! -Well, Maud... -Viking 14... Maud, please! Take your earrings! There's baba au rhum for dessert. During this time, in cinema... It all started in Sissi mène le bal, Viviane's birth film, if you prefer. In all episodes of Sissi, everyone danced the waltz. Viviane was promised to the archduke Helmut, an operetta prince. It was all going well until the day... Why are you stopping? Craps! Hello, dick in a tedd costume. Do something. Gentlemen! Help! Help! The next day in Montreuil-sous-Bois... Do you have a cloth? No. Where did you steal that? From the bins of an old cinema. -How much for everything? -60 euros. You're lucky. -Here, take five euros. -What? -What are you reading? -L'intégrale de Lebesgue. -And here? -Logarithms. Tables of logarithms. -Who likes that? -Not many people. No, not many people. It interests... -No one. -No. So it should be free. Come on, I'll buy you a coffee. That was my old life: old books, old boxes, old neighborhood, old building... old boy. Hey, sir! You're on a construction site. No, I'm at my home. It's completely filthy inside. On Tuesday, I'm knocking it down. 76% asbestos. If you and your Playmobil group are still here tomorrow, I'll do a mawashi-geri. Understood, Village People? You're crazy! It's a dangerous building. No, it's my childhood castle. No one lived in this building since 1972. Cats had replaced the neighbors, nettles had grown in the carpet, and instead of wallpaper, ferns climbed up the walls. I was far from imagining I'd move there in cinema. Papa Deloux, mama Deloux... I prevented a bulldozer attack. You can be proud of me. I would have liked to be like you, especially you, mom. Wow! Cool! Humbert's book on Hamilton's quaternions. Nice find. I've been looking for this for a while. Ah! My dear unknown, my anonymous hero... If you hear this voice in your sleep, I've poked you with my brooch. I beg you, come and save me. But I'll warn you, you'll enter a new world. Don't be surprised by anything, and above all, don't tremble. Doctor, I can't stop going from black to white. It's a nightmare. And I'm sizzling! Wait... I can no longer control my movements! I'm accelerating! I have no more color! What do I do? Doctor! Is it serious? I've never seen that. I've never seen that. Did you go to an exotic country? No, I've never left Montreuil-sous-Bois. Do you take coke? No, I only take Pépito with milk. I thought it was Kirikoff syndrome. I can do that. It could have been Simmon's disease, which I can also manage. Or Klein's disease, which I laugh about. But here... well... Which disease is it? Huh? -Which disease? -I fear it might be yours. -You need to see a specialist. -Of what? A specialist of what? I'm asking you! We don't know what you have. So, a specialist of what? There isn't one! There isn't one! Patient Régis Deloux, 40 years old. We note a light spiral hardening of the strangular wall of the thyroid body. More concerning, cellular contamination with a black and white texture and random glinting. Try these effervescent suppositories. Seven times a day. I've written the address of a friend who might be able to help. -Really? -For what you have, there's only him. A few suppositories later... Mr. Pierre Richard? Oh, asshole! Ah! It broke my foot! Damn, I hate when people bother me at golf. Oh, my word! Doctor Caligari... recommended me... Don't stay there, help me! Oh là là... Are you the man with the brooch? Have your colors returned? Unpleasant, the black and white. The suppositories are good. Massage my ankle. Ah! Easy! You're hurting me. I'm confused. The situation is serious. Show me the brooch. This? Yes. That's good, it's Viviane Cook. -Who's Viviane Crook? -Cook! She was kidnapped recently in Sissi mène le bal. It's her brooch. -What is this brooch? -A call for help. An SOS, a bottle in the sea. Being poked, you were designated to save her. You have to go into cinema to bring her back to Sissi. The man with the brooch. Little nugget! Look, I'm a teacher in advanced math. It's scientifically impossible to get into these films. We can go to the moon or Mars, but not into films. And what did Alice do? She went to Wonderland via cinema. You too, you'll go into cinema. Like her, Deloux! You're the modern-day Alice. Aren't you sick of being bossed around? Living in cat's piss, ferns and asbestos? Mr. Coq's frogs and square roots? -What do you think of this brooch? -I don't know. You're unlike others, you're a man of cinema. Cinéman! With all due respect, Régis Deloux will never set foot in a film. As you wish. Otherwise, how are things with women? No problem. Why? Just because. Why? Deloux, you need to know something. If you save the girl, you'll be a hero. So? In a film, the hero for all women. How many? Well, all of them... All of them, I know for a fact. When do I leave? I'm not just going to send you like a kung-fu, a war film. You need abs, biceps! Get training! Let's go. How are you, honey? Come on, Barthez... come on! Which film do I start with? What do you say about a spaghetti western in technicolor? -Early 1970s. -Very good. Music by Ennio Morricone. According to my information, that's where Viviane is. Do you know A Fistful of Dollars by Luigi Scarbozza? I don't know this film, but... You'll experience it, believe me. One question... Once I've found Viviane, how do I practically get her back in Sissi? Have you already gone from Lille to Marseille? Never. To do so, you have to cross a number of cities. Here, you're crossing films. How? In westerns on a horse. In Star Wars on a spaceship. In The Last Metro on Subway. In Titanic on ship. -It's child's play. -OK. And as promised, Mr. Richard, do I kiss the girl in the trip? That's what cinema's for! Good. And once I'm in Sissi mène le bal, how do I get back here? Listen to me very closely. Otherwise, no more Deloux. You must imperatively get in contact with water. A well, a river, a lake... a bit of rain, and you're home! Totally absurd. Now, how do I get into the film? Even easier! Get out the brooch. Getting the brooch out... There! You kiss it, and you're in the film. Where is Viviane? Ridiculous, I'm not kissing the brooch. Go on, I'm watching. Go on! Come on, my boy! Good luck. Action! Why didn't you put on the outfit I gave you? I've had enough of dancing for everyone. Calm down, Siss. Calm down. In 12 minutes, you'll dance down there. I want the entire Far West to drool over you. I want them to drool of jealousy! You say that, but you're jealous. Yes. And if I see one looking at you too closely, I'll dig a hole in his head! I don't care, I won't go. You won't go? But don't you understand? You're my thing, you're my object. You're my wife. I'm not your wife. -Who are you? -The look that kills, the growing beard, the smoking colt... It's Dangerous Régis. Régis Dangereux. What are you doing here? I came to get the girl, little cowboy. I hate when people kill me when my back is turned. Tell me, your mother made you brave, fortunately. There's a pair of santiags... who were just freed. Here, kid, take the cigarillo and go play Dangerous Régis. Hey! Olé! Ah! Yes, Mr. Coq? What's going on? There's a frightening racket at yours. Sorry, it's not the best moment. I'm in an action scene. Motherfucker! Get the fuck out! You're late. Your students are waiting. Tell them I'll make up your topology lesson tomorrow. Ah! Take that! Be in my office in five minutes, we'll explain, OK? Five minutes might be hard. Welcome to the underwear party, gringo. Amateurs? Look, lady, I'm the star of the film. I know her. Listen, fellows I know you wish a night with me Sing for me, baby! But let me tell you Tonight, I am a lonely woman I need love Viviane! Viviane! I'm here. Viviane! Viviane! Viviane! I have the brooch. It's him! I'm the man with the brooch. Viviane... See you soon. Backstage. If I were you, I wouldn't try. Shh! Shut up! Tell me, is the underwear party here, gringo? Careful, he's dangerous. To whom do I owe the honor? Craps. Douglas Craps. Nice to meet you, Donald. I'm Dangerous Régis. Régis Dangereux. Scarab beetle? If it's to get your breath, the answer's no. I'll have you. Um... You shouldn't have come here, small fry. I put my foot where I want, and it's often in faces. Huh, my nugget? Mi crotta. Tell me, young cyclops, I haven't yet finished with Miss Cook. We're having fun. She's good. Meet on the main street for the final duel. Let's say... 3:30. 3:30... P.M. Le monde est beau Tout le monde, il est gentil Le monde est beau Tout le monde, il est gentil Le monde est beau Tout le monde, il est gentil Le monde est beau Tout le monde, il est gentil Ahhh... Careful! We'll see who's in love with my wife. 'Régis Deloux, May 25, 1967, 'math teacher.' -Advanced math. -You're lucky I've already shat. You won't leave me alone here? I can't stay in the sun, I have fair skin. You won't be alone, you'll have plenty of girlfriends. Ants, snakes, scorpions. What you don't know, colonel, is that I'm sorry. I'm sorry, colonel! I apologize! Don't yell. I'm a son of a bitch, but I'm not deaf. Adios, gringo! Come back! Shit on my head and we'll no longer speak! Too bad. I want to go back to Montreuil. Help! Is anyone there? Help! There's a spider! They bite! Go away! I'm very sorry, Mr. Dangereux. He won the first set, you'll do better next time. -I'll take you with me. -I have to beat him first. Because in cinema, to get the princess, the hero must beat the bad guy. He's funny, Craps, with his hoops and his sun... He's a character. Ah! Craps... Get out of here fast. There's a well five hours away. You can go home. No, I'm fine here. I think I have a little crush on you. A little, a lot. Ah... When will we see each other again, sweetie? Kiss my brooch on Monday, at exactly 2:32. 2:32, no problem. Bye! See you Monday! I'll walk home, I'd love to. I love walking alone in the desert. But it's not THE desert. I mean, it's a desert. Damnit! Oh! Shit! -Deloux... -Yes? -Is that you? -Yes. -We weren't supposed to meet. -No. I hate it when people bother me playing pool. And I hate it when people take me for an idiot. They tell me: 'Régis, cinema, star, women'. The result, I get to the cinema: Douglas Craps. Tell me right away who this Douglas Craps is. Douglas Craps... No, don't touch the pool table. Craps is the essential bastard in cinema. Since the start, Craps has been on the bad side. Second neglected role, he gave a breath to his career by climbing the ranks of the bad to become the baddest of the bads. At the head of a group of crooks, he's caused panic and terror throughout cinema's history. With his Craps Angels, he's traveled thousands of kilometers of film. He's duelled prince charmings, policeman, good guys... All to steal their wives. And here, he's taken Vivane Cook, alias Sissi. A veritable obsession. She has become his only prisoner. And he takes her from film to film. What has become of them? They waited for cretins to come and save them. So you're telling me that I'm not the first man to go into a film? OK, it's true. But you're the only one to have come back. I'll explain, come on. Deloux, before you, boring sorts, guys with no history went into films to save young women from Craps' claws. Guys with no history? Useless fools, yes! It's a bit true. Look. The man being tortured there is Pierre Lefranc, a butcher from Bourg-la-Reine, taken by Craps in June 1972 in a scene from Maciste against Hercules. And here is Jean-Yves Leroux, married, 38, two kids, accountant from Châlons-sur-Marne. He's been followed by a Brontosaurus for eternity in a film from 1910. That's Bruno Antiste, product manager at Procter and Gamble. Craps abandoned him six years ago on a crazy car. Bam! That's Martial Blanc, called 'The Hamster', gas station worker. For 12 years he's been like that, above an acid basin. Deloux, you don't seem right. -Don't you like Viviane? -Yes, yes. She makes me crazy, but she doesn't care for me. A hero like you is made to confront danger. There's one question that's bothering me. Can I keep this head? Ah, no. That's a cinema head. You have to give it back, it's not yours. Don't worry, a good night's sleep and you'll get back your nice math head. Can I keep it for dinner? Until midnight. And after... And if I want to go out after? No. So you're just skipping your lessons, Régis? An ultra-private sentimental affiar. Duteil, tchi tchi! With the English teacher? She's not great. I said ultra-private. What did you do to your arm? I was dragged behind a horse. Sugar! Before, I had the time to neutralize around 10 desperados. What? Desperados. Ah yeah? Where? In the Nevada desert, the wildest region in the West. So you drink beer? Ah! Do you know the Far West, Sidonie? -Is that in the USA. -Really? Very dangerous, a veritable school of survival. You just have to be wary of bad guys. -And sunburn. -Ah yes? I'm wary of assholes. Get a sheet out, test time. No way! Is there a problem, Mamesse? Do you want to fight? A little duel at Winchester 73? For those who don't know yet, Régis Deloux uses a Winchester 73 multi-shot. Get a sheet out. I want to see what you know about Tchebychev's polynomials. Give me the time, Combourieux. 2:31, sir. The minutes separating my encounters with Viviane seemed like centuries. I couldn't wait to see her. I wondered which film I'd see her in. Harry Potter? Scarface? Kirikou? Silence, you testicles! Are you focused, my love? We've been here for two hours. We're back. The art of the archer is in bending his bow. -Deloux! -I abandoned you as a worm, and you're back as a frog? Ha! Ha! Ha! I came for Viviane. I left her in A Fistful of Dollars. Un Pugno di dollari di più. -Little John, I suppose? -Ar your service, Robin. Are you Friar Tuck? Tuck. Yes, ho ho. Squash, OK? Assemble the gang, friends. And take this puppet to the stake. Let me go! Ha! Ha! Ha! Don't fear, we won't dirty your warthog face with our urine. You're not worthy of that. We generally reserve it for Mother Nature. Silence, fools! Let's abandon this sad sire to decompose and let's feast. We'll meet again, my little Deloux. Mmm! This chicken is delicious! Fly away! What is your job, Régis? When I was younger, I taught math in France. Ha! Pretentious! Do you have a princess? I see, madam is jealous. I like that. You're a funny sort, Régis. How long have you put up with this psychopath Douglas Craps? He hasn't always been like that. When he kidnapped me, I thought I'd die. But he was the first one to show me there's a life outside Sissi. Other environments, other people. He made me discover new horizons. With me, you'll go from the horizon to azur, from azur to firmament. And from firmament to paradise. To paradise. Ah, Régis... You'll see, Montreuil is better than Sherwood. Wait, Régis... You'll love it, you'll see. -We'll go to the cinema every day. -Régis. They just built a multiplex, five minutes from school. You'll love it. Big love on a big screen. No... shh! What does this young wren have to say? It tells me it's happy. It holds me to your bawdy subject. -What do you mean? -Shh! I can't translate everything. It's important to be in touch with nature and its friends. Oh, look! I swipe your lute, young minstrel. Go and fix your acne, fix my bow and meet me back at the camp. Go on! Ya! Go on! Beautiful Viviane Beautiful woman Régis Hood is in love They'll feel from my blade Those who make your eyes cry Solo! Yeah! Hey! You're right. Not here, my lady. I know a nearby thicket which is better for the thing. -But, Régis... -Come on, duckling. There! They're there! Alas, before paradise, I fear that your ex is going to cause a hellish halt. -How? -Look behind you. -Deloux! -Taïaut! Deloux, is was bound to happen! You wander, you drag, and here you are! Viviane! Come on, Viviane! Deloux! Little John, Friar Tuck, Tuck, with me! Hide, Viviane, I'll come for you! Here! Viviane... Oh, it's a fake one. Damn! This is going to get messy! Viviane! Ha! Ippon sonage! Viviane, my God! Viviane! Viviane! Régis, my brooch, Saturday night, 8:50! 8:50, OK! -Ah! -That hurts. Oh... Madam, can we go in, is it contagious? No. Let's go, Charlotte. Mr. Coq, they shot me in the back, those bastards. What's this get-up? Impossible. -Who are these bastards? -Craps' men. The who? In Sherwood Forest, Craps set up... ow. He set up archers in the bush. Listen, Deloux, you're tired, I'll replace you. Régis Deloux doesn't abandon his students two months before exams. I'm not like other men. We've gathered that. It's good, Christine. I'm a man. A man? -Do you know Spiderman? -By name, yes. -Batman? -Not personally, but... -Superman? -By reputation. Well, Mr. Coq, you have in front of you the latest of the man family: Cinéman. This isn't right. You're all over the place. Régis Hood bids you goodbye, papa and mama Deloux. Don't doubt it, you gave birth to a superhero. And I'm very grateful to you for it. Mama Deloux, you'll be happy, your Régis has a fiancée. Her name is Viviane, she's as pretty as you, even prettier. Whoever approaches Viviane, I'll pierce them. After all these adventures, it's time to get back in shape. I canceled my lessons, turned off my phone and I'm going to do a few lengths. Here you go. Thanks. Look, it's De Groot's sister! -He's not well! -It's my brother's teacher. Hello, Deloux. I've been trying to reach you for three hours. No time to rest. If you call me in the next 30 seconds, I'll freeze you. It's worse than black and white. Frozen image. I'll neutralize you. Out of the way, Rugrats. Cinéman needs to train. -Hey, what about us? -Shush! Deloux, you don't answer? OK, I warned you. Oh! Shit! What's wrong? This is too funny. Hey, sir! They're all calling. The swimming pool touch was nice, but I stuffed up again. I'm meeting her on Saturday and I have to finish with Craps. It's between him and me. Be careful, Craps is fuming at the moment. I'm not afraid. Yes, but Viviane still isn't in Sissi. This time, it's for good. I didn't become Cinéman for nothing. Be more professional. Otherwise, I'll send Jean Dujardin. Don't joke. Ah, you're afraid of Dujardin? Ha! Ha! Viviane would like him, right? OK, enjoy the film! Hehe! My little Deloux, you'll become the heart-throb of Rome. Action... You have everything you want! Endless extras, wild animals, chariot races, historical reconstitutions! It's a bit better than Sissi the Empress. I'm bored here. I spend my whole days eating grapes. You treat me like a slave. What more do you want? You're the only thing I have, my love. I've spent my whole life in Sissi admiring you silently. I had nothing to make you look at me. You laughed! Hi! Hii Hi! You danced! You left with that asshole Helmut! Never with me. I'm exhausted, Douglas. -I've heard that 100 times. -What do you want, my love? I want to go home, in my film. Screw your film! It's rubbish! She's a bitch, your Sissi! And the blonde! 'Do you like sauerkraut and waltz, my princess?' Is that what you want? Sauerkraut and waltz? Until the end of time? Little extra! Never lay a hand on me again, you hear me? Is it that fool Deloux who has washed your brain? How many films have you been sleeping together behind me? In any case, the Senate voted for his death due to absence. Your nectar, Caesar. Ah! I'll meet him again in any film! A musical comedy, a cartoon... By Zeus! Poison in my gob... Help! They poisoned the Emperor! We'll be far away by the time he wakes up! You never respond when I ask you to come to Montreuil. All the women must love you there. No, not all of them. Most of them. But I must confess that you are the most beautiful. You say that, but I'm not easy to live with. I'm a princess. I'll do another 20 films with you. But I have to return. Return, always return. We could do two or three films together instead of returning immediately. Come on, just one last one, Viviane. One film. But that's it. You have my word. We could go to mom's favorite film. Ay, ay, ay... What sort of film is this, Régis? I don't want any more films with bad guys. No risk, it's a romantic film. A film made for sensitive lovers. -What's it called? -Barry Lyndon. Using mom's film wasn't very honest. But I did everything to keep Viviane as long as possible with me. Isn't it nice here in Barry Lyndon? Mom would have loved to know that we're here. Yes, but no one is noticing us. No one is speaking to us. It's normal, we just arrived. I feel like we don't belong here, that we're out of place. Relax. We're at home here. Take a seat before anyone else. What are you doing at Lady Lyndon's musical days? Don't go shoving Count Deloux rather than Marquis de Montreuil. -You're not on the list. -Change what you're reading, that will open you up. Fantonette's adventures. We don't have that name. Stop your tale, valet. Princess Sissi and I are invited as Lady Lyndon's VIP guests. Excuse me. Let's go, Régis. Sit down, Vivane. Music! Let the party continue! Tell them who I am, Viviane! I'm Cinéman, damnit! So it seems that you're guests to treat with esteem? We're very sorry, Lady Lyndon. No! Mrs. Lyndon's hospitality is the measure of her beauty. I'm afraid, dear friend, that you don't figure in this film. He's right, let's go. But with respect, Mrs. Lyndon, do I not seem as though I would make a convenient Duke Lyndon? I think this character thinks he's camping. What? Camping. It's a place where simpletons like to spend their free time. Please, friends. This charming little couple came to the wrong place. Take them out of my sight. And to punish them, throw them to the depths of cinema. Ay, ay, ay... I'm humiliated. It's a scandal! A mascarade! I'll be back! With compliments from Cinéman. We'll see each other again. What's wrong, Viviane? Can you see where we are? I'm a princess, and I'm a slut in a Scorsese film. Are you happy? I want to go back to Sissi. Aren't you happy with a hero among the lowlives? It's as if a yeti shat on you. How classy. You're ridiculous. And here, it's very dangerous. I love everything that's lowlife. Do you know what I do with lowlives? Are you talking to me, lowlife? Are you talking to me, Craps? Are you talking to me? Who are these guys? They're not in Taxi Driver! Don't you recognize them? They're droogies from A Clockwork Orange, a violent film! What? The Bee Gees? But they're bearded! Droogies, not Bee Gees! A bit of clockwork orange, lovebirds? Let me go! You're hurting me! Deloux, you're dead. Craps! Ah! I have a surprise. for you, Deloux. Let her go! I'm taking you to my mother's favorite film! Ow... Judas! Assassin! No way! Get me out of here. Yes, OK! It's OK! Shit! Look... Go, go, go... I'm in love, Sidonie. It's the first time a woman needs me. Don't get upset, but the ideal woman doesn't exist in reality. But in cinema... Have you thought about seeing a psychiatrist? Do you think I'm crazy? I have a mission. I have to take her back to her film, and I will, Sidonie. I'm not the same. A hand held out, a heart beating, two eyes crying. It's the new Régis Deloux, with real feelings, like in cinema. Have you chosen? Yes, a menu S, two cheese skewers and a green tea. For sir? You speak Japanese? Very nice Osaka accent. Very rare for European. What Osaka accent? What's going on? Speak, tell me what's going on in your head, look at your chest. I gave Mamesse a zero. This is Pierre Richard! Move! Another of his jokes! I'm subtitled! Can I help, sir? I've had it with him! Oh, my God! Quick! Quick! Even the soap stays! Ridiculous! I've had enough! Hello. This is Régis Deloux, alias Viking 14, leave a message, naughty girl. Sorry about the subtitles, Deloux, but the fun's over. But the Japanese will help you when you go into a manga. We know the film in which Craps and Viviane go. If you leave straight away, you'll arrive before them. You'll have a few hours to get familiar, as it's a dangerous film. Deloux, it's your last chance. You wanted me? I want to ask you something important. But swear to respect my desires. Sir! You're very mysterious. Use limited development, De Groot. If the worst were to happen, I want this class to be named after me. A simple plaque at the back of the room. 'Régis Deloux classroom'. What could happen? We never know. Never knows. The jungle is ours. Ah! Was it a good trip, boss? That uniform suits you! I made you a juice. You stink! You stuck your head up an ostrich's ass. Come on, princess, let's get off. Oh! Stop! You're scratching me! Lay down! Easy, Kala! Stop, Kala! You're pulling my testicles! Come on, Doniphane, let's go! Yes, boss. We have to get to the camp before nightfall. Affirmative, boss. -Over here, bwana! -Hurry up! Come on, Catin! Cheeta, I don't know how to use a vine. I eat all the trees. I don't know how you do it. The scream is fine, I got that first time, but the vine is hard. How will I get to her? Your thing is absurd, it will never work. Can you imagine? 'Tarzan upside down, the king of reverse.' What's this Tyrolean chant? An upside-down Tarzan! It's a very bad omen! Balan... Balan... Balancoire In the jungle, I was quickly copied, plagiarized. I started the trend of upside-down Tarzan. You'll wait for me here? I have to try! And even some very trendy colleagues didn't hesitate to go backwards. Belle histoire Tu m'emmènes tout là-haut Parmi les oiseaux Et je vole, et je m'envole Et je danse, et je m'élance Et je roule, et je m'enroule Oh oh oh So, Miss Cook, are you warming your buttocks on the fire? She's dreaming of her fornications with Deloux, boss. You know the math-head from Montreuil-sous-Bois ! For me, this isn't the jungle. The jungle is more the Austrian court. For me, this is civilization. As I hear. Here, no one will hear you scream. No one will come and save you. Huh, sweetie? Answer! Do you think you're in a silent film? You disgust me! Lüger... Here, boss. We'll finish our filmography here. Yes, among the gibbons, the macaques, the bonobos... You, Sissi... me, Tarzan! Forever with you? I'd rather die. Douglas, I beg you! Don't let me go! You see, Doniphane, giving satisfaction to my fiancées is a principle. You really listen to women, boss. What a lesson. Don't let me go! No! Don't let me go! I love you! Douglas! Est-ce une nouvelle vie Ou l'effet du printemps Qui me gratifie De l'ardeur de mes 20 ans ? Est-ce une nouvelle vie Ou l'effet du printemps Qui me gratifie De l'ardeur de mes 20 ans ? J'en ai comme un vertigo J'en ai comme un vertigo It smells like piss. Look out! Est-ce une nouvelle vie Ou l'effet du printemps Qui me gratifie De l'ardeur de mes 20 ans Est-ce une nouvelle vie Ou l'effet du printemps Qui me gratifie De l'ardeur de mes 20 ans He has slyness in his skin. Are you OK? Look out! Est-ce une nouvelle vie Ou l'effet du printemps Qui me gratifie De l'ardeur de mes 20 ans J'en ai comme un vertigo J'en ai comme un vertigo Doniphane! Wait. You won't do that again, right? Don't worry. Tarzan isn't my mother's favorite film. You seem worried. I'm hungry. Tchounga! Tchounga wa! Bouga! Bouga! Tchounga wa! I asked him for a banana, he brought me an apple. I wanted to know... How did you find me in the middle of the jungle? Love, Viviane, love. Off to Sissi, Vivane! They're there, bwana! No, Viviane. Tchounga! If you're a man, Deloux, bring your witnesses tomorrow at 5:00 am, to the Mortefeuille plain. Take care of her. It's over. Oh, it's beautiful here! A baby deer! I feel like I'm going to enjoy it here. I'll be just in time for the ball tonight. This is my favorite scene. Warn those higher up that I don't like the waltz. It makes me vomit. I prefer slow dances. I booked a room at La Grande vadrouille, I'd rather take you to La Boum. Don't take it badly. I won't come with you and you won't stay. I could have loved you, but... there are rules in cinema, you have to accept them. Helmut! Who's that? -My love! -Liebling, what a pleasure. Come, everyone is waiting for you. You'll be the star of the show. Viviane, don't do this to me. Out of mercy! Viviane! Relax a bit, my friend. You've worked hard. Cinéman... You're joking! Driver! To Georges Méliès train station. Yes, I'm back. I had to come back one day. Right, De Groot? I have old copies to give you back. Mamesse, 14 out of 20. It's not very thorough, but full of good intentions. Combourieux, progress. 15 out of 20. Shh! You're not necessarily made for math, but... -I can feel intelligence. -Thanks. A personality. De Groot, I gave you 16 out of 20. I like you. I know you have family problems, you should have mentioned them. Good luck, son. Stay strong. I'm here. Fabienne... Elle a ces longues Mains de dentellière À damner l'âme d'un Vermeer Cette silhouette vénitienne Quand elle se penche à ses persiennes Ce geste, je le sais par cœur Pour moi, c'est sûr, Elle est d'ailleurs Let's go! Et moi, je suis tombé en esclavage Little John, shoot! De ce sourire, de ce visage Et je lui dis : "Emmène-moi" You'll never get me, Craps! Et moi je suis prêt A tous les sillages I've been hit in the heart, I think. Mais elle passe et ne répond pas I'm coming, Viviane! L'amour, pour elle, est sans valeur I love you, Viviane! Come back! Pour moi, c'est sûr Elle est d'ailleurs Viviane! Et moi, je suis tombé en esclavage De ce sourire, de ce visage Et je lui dis : "Emmène-moi" Et moi, je suis prêt A tous les sillages Vers d'autres lieux, d'autres rivages Mais elle passe et ne répond pas Et moi, je suis tombé en esclavage De ce sourire, de ce visage Et je lui dis : "Emmène-moi" -Hello? -Deloux? Bravo, my son! You got there in the end. It took you a while. Do you have news from Viviane? She's well. But you left without giving her her brooch back. -So? -You have to give it to me. I'm waiting for you. I need it tomorrow morning. Listen to me, Mr. Richard. This brooch is precious, it's all that I have from her. So you undersand. Viviane will understand. In the Vienna court, people are more punctual. We're in Montreuil. We were good together, right? Hurry up, we'll miss the start. You missed the Derviche grand prix last week. If I understand, Régis, that's your fiancée. Yes, I dropped her off in this scene. You didn't stay? I had a train. Shh! I dropped her off in horse and cart! Yes, I'm in love with her. I think your absence caused gossip at the court, the Emperor wasn't happy. She looks like she's bored. Action! If you're going to disappoint for the bridge tournament, let me know. Look happy, people are watching us. I don't want to dance tonight. I've had enough of your behavior. You're strangling me! I don't want to dance. -What's wrong? -Leave me alone! It's unbearable! You ashamed me! -I'll never go to the ball again. -That's serious! That's enough! Driver, stop! I want to get off. Don't even think about it. You're a puppet. You're boring and empty. Kiss me, whore! Olé! Régis? Hilfe! Hilfe! Go and join the clan of fools! Sergeant Garcia is waiting for you. Come, Viviane. Régis... I've come for you. Where are we going? Elsewhere, Viviane, elsewhere. Cinema or reality, I know that the only thing that counts is love. We all have a princess waiting for us somewhere and a brooch to give back that poked our heart. End Stop, Deloux! You can't be Charlot, the Godfather, Mad Max, Indiana Jones or James Bond! Easy! You're speaking to Cinéman. The Joker, yes! You made a mess of cinema! Yes? Yes, Viviane, my love. You're in Toy Story with Cinéboy? Great! I'm having a drink with Kung Fu Panda and I'll be there. Can I come? A 2 ou 300 années-lumière C'est écrit Je devais refaire ma vie A 2 ou 300 années-lumière C'est joli Tout a l'air tellement petit So, Deloux, what's going on? I have problems. Yesterday, I was totally... Pff! Subtitles. Subtitles? Pff! Pff! Pff! Pff! A 2 ou 300 années-lumière Ton quartier Vais-je encore rester fidèle ? A 2 ou 300 années-lumière Je m'en vais Renaître au milieu du ciel Je voyage à travers l'infini Krüger, Persée, étranges galaxies Moi qui ai passé ma vie en rêvant Un jour, peut-être, de suivre le vent Une comète a frôlé mon bolide Avant de disparaître dans le vide Lumières troubles Et soleils à l'envers Le danger est passé, j'accélère A 2 ou 300 années-lumière C'est écrit Je devais refaire ma vie A 2 ou 300 années-lumière C'est joli Tout a l'air tellement petit Je dérive à travers l'infini Souvenirs, soupirs, autour d'Altaïr J'ai comme une drôle d'envie De te revoir Marcher, parler, et puis me sourire A 2 ou 300 années-lumière C'est gagné Je resterai toujours fidèle A 2 ou 300 années-lumière Je m'en vais Suis-moi au milieu du ciel Allez, viens
