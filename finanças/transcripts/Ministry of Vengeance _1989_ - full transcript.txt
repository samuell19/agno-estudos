-[soft oriental flute] -[frogs croaking] [ominous music] [music continues] Want a hit? Nuh-uh. Come on. It's great for the nerves. Ah. Did you get drafted? I enlisted. You? The same. I wanted to see what the real world was like, and I ended up in this shit hole. You know, nobody knows what the fuck is going on. Guys are getting blown away here every day, and nobody's got a fucking clue. -[oriental flute] -[flies buzzing] [birds chirping] [boom] [gunfire] Move out. [gunfire] [man] Help me! [David] Grab ahold. [gunfire] [bullets ricocheting] [groans loudly] [gunfire] [wounded man grunting] Davis! Davis, get your ass over here! How bad is he? Sparky! [gunfire] We need an evac. Call it in. Big Vic, this is Easy Six, do you read? Big Vic, this is Easy Six, do you copy? Over. [bullets ricocheting] [boom] [gunfire fades] -[Miguel] Lieutenant. -Yo? [suspenseful music] [Freeman] Shortcut to hell, gentleman. [gunfire] Miguel, check it out. All right, while we're waiting for evac, you men can rest a bit, but stay alert. You can bet your ass Charlie's somewhere close. [Sparky] Big Vic, this is Easy Six. Do you copy? Come on. Don't worry about it. We've been through this 100 times. We ain't seen Charlie yet. [suspenseful music] [guttural scream] Holy shit. He's in trouble down there. Miller, you're next. I don't have to tell you to watch yourself down there. -Charlie's pretty tricky. -[click] [click] What's that thing? Have you gone religious on me? Give Charlie my regards. [flies buzzing] [suspenseful music] [labored breathing] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [gunshots] [gunshots] [shouts] No! [boom] [jet engine roars] [announcement in Italian] [Gail] David. David, are you all right? [sighs] [David] Is that our flight? Yeah, it's two hours late. Honey, if you'll get the bags, I'll take Kimmy, okay? Come on, sleepyhead. Wake up. It's time to go. [Kimmy] I don't want to play anything. [Gail] Okay. I'm really hungry. -You want to eat something? -[Kimmy] Milk, please. [Gail] Okay, let me get my bag. [Kimmy] I want French toast. [Gail] Okay, we'll get some on the plane, sweetie. [background chatter] Okay. -Anxious to get home, honey? -[Gail] Just a little. Thank you, David. [David] What for? [Gail] A great trip to Europe. Come on, honey. -[David] Come on, kiddo. -[Kimmy fusses] [Gail] I loved Rome. [David] It was a fun trip, wasn't it? [Gail] David, I love you. [woman over PA] Attention, ladies and gentlemen. Air Italy announces the departure of flight 392 from Rome to JFK... -Thank you. -Italian men are so polite. Come on, Mother. [woman over PA] Please check-in with a ticket agent if you have not previously done so. All passengers traveling with young children proceed to the gate. [ominous music] David, she lost her shoe. -[David] Hm? -Her shoe. -I'll go get it. -Okay, sweetie. [Kimmy] Where's daddy going? He's just going to go get your shoe, honey. [ominous music] [Ali speaks Arabic] [gunfire] [people screaming] Kim? [shouts] Kim! [people screaming] [shouts in Arabic] [Gail screams] Let us board or more will die. We're taking this action for the People's Liberation. If the plane is not allowed to leave this airport, this is the fate of all hostages. [dramatic music] [inaudible] [gunfire] [shouts] No! [baby crying] [Michael in Italian] Excuse me, miss. [in English] I'm looking... [in Italian] I'm looking for David Miller. -David Miller? -[in Italian] Yes. -[in Italian] In the chapel. -The chapel? -Yes. -Thank you. [church bells] Please, God, don't take my daughter. [somber violin] [shaky breath] Don't take Kimmy too. [Michael clears throat] [in English] Reverend Miller. My name is Michael Robinson. I'm here on behalf of the American Ambassador. He's asked me to express his deepest-- Mr. Robinson... [sniffs] [sighs] My daughter is in surgery. I'm not... I'm not sure if she's going to make it or not. I'd like to pray for her alone, please. Yes, of course. The, ah... The number on the back is the stateside branch office in your area. If there's anything the State Department can do, let us know. Mr. Robinson... Those people on the plane, were they hurt? They were flown to Damascus and released. [David] The man who killed my wife... what happened to him? I'm sorry, we don't know. [church bells] [Hughes] From here, Rome seems like such a long, long way. But even though we could not be there on the day the good Lord Jesus called Gail and Kim home... our prayers were there to help lift their spirits to the Kingdom of Heaven, because... they were loved. Now the mortal remains of our dear friends have come home one last time to say goodbye to those... who knew them, and who... loved them the best to be remembered. Miss Gail and Kim Miller touched our lives. So now... they surely touch the hand of God. We're so thankful that they were part of our lives. We loved them. And we shall miss them. [somber violin] God bless you, David. [David sobs] Thank you. Reverend Miller? Would you come with me, please? Reverend Miller. My name's John Whiteside. Special agent in charge. First let me say that I am terribly sorry about what happened to your family. Would you have a seat? [David] I was told by the embassy in Rome that I could count on you for help. Absolutely. How can we be of service? I would like the man that killed my wife and daughter brought to justice, Mr. Whiteside. Let me assure you that your State Department is doing everything in its power to do just that. [David] And just what might that be? Well, our overseas embassy is working with the local authorities in Rome. What we're trying to do is to locate him and then use diplomatic channels to extradite him. So I want you to rest assured and have faith that we're going to find him and bring him to justice. -[David] Mr. Whiteside. -Yes? By vocation, we priests tend to be students of the word. Now, am I wrong, or am I being patronized here? Well... To tell you the truth, the man that you're looking for is located somewhere deep in Lebanon. And we don't really expect that much cooperation in getting him out. [David] What you're saying is that you'll do nothing. No, what I'm saying is that there's nothing we can do. [scoffs] Mr. Whiteside, the man that murdered my wife and daughter will do that to somebody else if you don't stop him. Can't you people see that? We're doing everything that we can. What's this man's name in Lebanon, and how can I find him? I'm sorry, Reverend Miller. There's nothing more I can tell you. [David] You want me to forget it. Is that about right? You want me to pretend that none of this happened? Is that about right, Mr. Whiteside? Let me promise you that this is not going to end here. Post surveillance. Keep me informed. Right. [emotive violin music] [sighs] [sighs] [coughs] [dramatic music] [gunfire] [David shouts] No! [music continues] [bells ringing] [faint organ playing] I've seen his face, Father. I know who he is. [sighs] The man who murdered my family is in Lebanon. He's going to go unpunished. He'll be judged, David. In this life or the next. When I lost Gail and Kim... I almost believed that somehow dying would be better than living with the pain. Through it all, something... something sustained me, Father. It was your faith. [David] No, Father. It was not my faith. It was anger, and it was hatred, but it was not my faith. Hatred sustained me, Father. And it terrifies me now. [organ playing] Be seated. [organ fades] We'll be reading from the Gospel according to Luke. Chapter six, verse 27. "But I say unto which here: love your enemies. Do good... to those who hate you. Bless those who curse you. And pray for those... who despitefully use you. Unto him that..." [ominous music] "Unto him that smiteth the one cheek." [music continues] I'm sorry. I don't belong here. I'm taking an indefinite leave. "For now we see through a glass darkly." Words can't help the way I feel. Not even His words. Don't turn your back on the Church, David. Put your faith in God. He can help you. No, He can't. [sighs] But I do know someone who can. -[gunshots] -Jesus H Christ. Kincaid! You shoot like a pussy. What the hell is wrong with you, Kincaid? Hold on to the goddamn gun, son. -It ain't gonna bite your ass. -[man] Colonel. There's somebody in the lodge who wants to see you. -I'm busy here. Who is he? -I don't know, sir. He says you fought together in 'Nam. [gunshots] I fought with a couple thousand guys in 'Nam, muttonhead. Watch these clowns. Make sure they don't shoot themselves. Yes, sir. I'll be a son of a bitch. Look what the cat dragged in. Miller, how you doing? [laughs] -Hey, all right. -[David] I get by. What the hell is this here? [David chuckles] Come on, Father. Have a drink with your old rad six. What's a man of the cloth doing in this den of iniquity? Well, I saw your camp on television last year. And I came because I need your help. What kind of help? Some advice. Some... guns. Well, you're a priest, for Christ's sake. [click] This is about Rome, isn't it? I watch the news too, you know. You're not thinking about going after those bastards? No, not all of them. Just one. Ali Aboud. Aboud? My friend. You better have a drink and just forget about it. [sighs] Come on, get serious. Even if you made it over there, you'd get your ass shot off before you got within ten miles of the man. I'm going after him. That's with or without your help. What's it going to be? All right. Five hundred for the first week. I'll expect you to do the whole nine yards, just like every candy-ass Rambo out there. I don't treat you special because of 'Nam, understood? Understood. -[machine gun fire] -[military snare drums] [Freeman] Lift those knees. Raise those knees high. Let's go! Come on, men. Keep moving. You run like you've got a load of shit in your pants, Miller. Lift those knees. Keep moving. What do you want to be, a boy or a girl? Let's go. Hustle! All right, let's move it. Keep it rolling. Get that rope back over there. Keep on going. -Get up that tree. -[soldier] Let's go! [Freeman] Move your ass! Good. Good. Keep hanging there. That's right. You too, Miller. Let's go. [men grunting] [Freeman] Hang in there. Let's go. Ah! What do you think you're doing? Fishing? Just because you smell like ape shit, that don't mean you're Tarzan. Let's go. Keep it rollin', kid. Next case. Come on. Hand over hand. Come on. Get up, get up. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Let's go. [Freeman] All right. Move it. I've seen ivy climb walls faster than you, Miller. Forty three seconds. Jeez, that's pathetic. -I didn't come here for this. -[Freeman] Yes you did, pal. That's what you paid for. I told you, it's all or nothing. So get used to it. [panting heavily] All right, Miller. Be on the shooting range 15 minutes. Flesh and blood game ain't gonna be quite the same, is it, Reverend? Nothing like hunting the real thing. Remember how to work this? I don't need target practice. Just tell me how I can find Aboud. You don't find Aboud. Aboud finds you. If he does, and you don't know how to use this, you're going to be in deep shit. Lock and load. [ominous music] [click] Let's see if you've still got it. The gun ain't going to fire itself, Reverend. [gunfire] You always were the best rifleman in the company. Am I wrong, or are these the first rounds you've fired since Cu Chi? I never had a better tunnel man than you, Miller. I hated to see you lose it so soon. You never told me what happened that day. All I know is the man I sent down wasn't the man I got back. I could see it in your eyes. You'd lost the edge. I can't walk into Lebanon with an M16. [Freeman] What did you see down there? What did you find in that tunnel? Was it religion? I'll need something more discreet. Something with a little more fire power. Don't worry about it. When the time comes, and if you're still hell bent on suicide, I'll give you something you can work with. [ominous music] [Freeman] Gun ain't going to fire itself, Reverend. [laughing] [Freeman] Nothing like hunting the real thing. What did you see down there, Miller? What did you find down in that tunnel? -Was it religion? -[gunshot] [breathing heavily] All right, listen up. We're going to do some tracking. Your job is to find the squirrel here and bring the flag home. All right, Rocky, move out. You'll be humping in full gear but no ammunition. We don't want any accidents. You're free to split off, follow whatever spore you want. -Understood? -[men] Yes, sir. Let me hear it again. -[men shout] Yes, sir! -All right. Give me your clips. [clips rattling] All right, hounds... move out! [ominous music] [panting] [deeply inhales and exhales] [exhales heavily] [twig snaps] [ominous music] Who's there? Freeman? [gunshot] [drumbeats] [gunfire] [gunfire] -[grunts] -[Freeman] Whoa! I thought that was you running like a spooked buck. What are you doing back here? Somebody's trying to kill me. What are you talking about? One of those happy campers of yours is running around with a silencer on his gun. We've seen this before. It's nothing to be ashamed of. What are you talking about? [Freeman] I'm talking about a Vietnam Vet under a lot of stress gets a gun in his hand, walks out the woods, suddenly it's the jungle all over again. I'm talking about you, Miller. Don't worry about it. Why don't you go back to the lodge, get some rest. -Right down that path. -You're running a camp here with a bunch of homicidal maniacs that think war is some kind of game. I don't need that kind of help. [panting] If I'm going to die, I want to die trying to find Aboud. I'm checking out of here. [ominous music] [soft violin music] [music swells] -[gentle knocking] -[music fades] Um... I saw your light on. I thought I'd come in... talk to you before you left. You know, you'll never make it to Lebanon. Not without these. It's Beirut via Athens. Ticket and instructions are inside. I've set you up in a safe house in the village of Beshmael out in the Beqaa. You should feel right at home there, it's an old mission run by a friend of mine. So just keep wearing that nice black suit. Besides, it's good cover. Why are you doing this now? [Freeman] You should get out of the habit of asking too many questions. You might just ask the wrong person. You're about to have your nuts squeezed between the Jews, the PLO, the Phalangists, the Syrians, and the Shiites. You couldn't hope to find a more dangerous spot -on this earth, my friend. -[letter rustling] What about Aboud? [Freeman] Aboud is insulated. He won't be easy to find, and he will be even harder to get to. More than that I can't help you. Good luck, Reverend. Oh, um... I hope you and the man upstairs are still tight, because... you are going to need all the help you can get. [stewardess] Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to welcome you on board Yugoslav Airlines DC-10 today. Our flight to Athens via Belgrade will be 14 hours and 30 minutes at an altitude of 35,000 feet... [jet engines roar] [military snare drum] What do you do at the mission, Zarah? Sometimes I'm a teacher. Sometimes I'm a nurse. Sometimes I pray. [Jeep rattling] What's going on? Don't speak. [man] Cross-worshiper, where are you from? -Where are you going? -He's Austrian. He's here to work with the mission. -Cross-worshipers. -[gunshots] What is happening here? Men fighting men. The Muslims fight the Christians. Christians fight the Palestinians. Before that, the Palestinians, Israelis. Next week, who knows. [car engine stops] [goats bleating] Hello, Yasmin. Please take these. Where do you want me to take them? In the back room. [donkey braying] Reverend Miller. David, isn't it? [David] Father Bloor. Welcome to our church. [rapid breathing] I'm so excited about having you here, David. My dear. [chuckles] Perhaps the second voice of a man of the faith will get through to our little brothers and sisters. Mine does not seem to be sufficient. Come. This sad little country needs a great deal of help. Praying for a miracle is all I can think of to do. Have you performed any miracles lately, Reverend? [ominous music] David? I'll show you to your room. Please forgive the accommodation, dear boy. Don't they say that poverty is next to... something interesting, I'm sure. [chuckles] This will be comfortable. Thank you, Father. I'll see you at dinner. I'll have Fatima draw you a bath. You've had a long journey. Be comfortable. Oh, ah, someone delivered a package for you from... It's beneath the bed. [suspenseful music] [gunfire] You're shooting at the wrong target, asshole! -Wake up. -[man] Colonel. [gunfire] Take over. [sinister music] Have a seat. Go ahead, have a seat. [sighs] You want a drink? [Freeman] There's one thing I'd like to share with you. And that's my boot up your ass. You got some balls sending your goons into my camp, trying to take out one of my people! Your people? The company runs this camp. The company runs you. It would've been better for you if we had terminated the priest. Do you know what you've done? Can't you comprehend the damage you've done to the Agency by sending him to Lebanon? He could very well compromise one of our prime Middle East operatives! The company's most valuable link to terrorist network both in Europe and the Middle East has been seriously jeopardized by this half-ass stunt that you pulled! [Freeman] He would've gone anyway! At least this way we can control his movements. Tell Central Intelligence not to worry. He'll get frustrated and come home if he doesn't get himself killed first. Yeah, well, we're not taking that chance! We're sending you over to join your priest friend in Beshmael. And if he comes close to blowing our man's cover, then you'll finish what you started with extreme prejudice. Do you understand me? Give him the envelope. Your orders are in that envelope. I want to tell you something. You mess this up on us... and this is not going to be very good for you. Now get the hell out of here. How long have you known Colonel Freeman, David? We were in Vietnam together. How long have you known him? Oh, we go back years. We were in government service together. You were a chaplain in the army? No, I was with the State Department then. But that was before I left foreign service to follow in my family's footsteps. My father and my grandfather were both men of the cloth. [chuckles] But enough about me. How about you, Zarah? My mother is dead. My father sits beside you. Zarah came to the Church seeking sanctuary. I think she likes to make a joke about the title "Father." But I respond by saying thank God that you got your mother's good looks. [chuckles] And my father's devotion to the Church. Oh, the passion of the recently converted. Thank you, my child. That is Fatima. She cooks and cleans for us. Does she ever speak? She seldom speaks since the accident. She was caught in public unveiled by zealots. They consider that a sin against Islam. God forgive them. By any chance, do these... zealots follow a man by the name of Ali Aboud? [ominous music] Do you know Ali Aboud? Ali? I'm sorry. These names seem so similar to me sometimes. Now, this is someone you've known before, David? We met once before in Rome. I have some... business with the man that I would like to finish. I would think that as a man of God you would be looking for signs of His work here, not of His neglect. Ali Aboud murdered my family, Zarah. Father, can you help me find him? We're strangers in this country, Father. Our policy is not to proselytize. We wait for them to come to us. Is there anyone... [sighs] anyone at all that can help me find him? [knocking] [door creaks] Reverend Miller. I can help you. We both have suffered from Ali Aboud. You see? [inhales sharply] My hatred burns as deeply as yours. Tonight, after they have gone to sleep, I will take you to Arbat. That is where you will find Ali Aboud. Meet me behind the church in one half-hour. [ominous music] [click] [tense music] [music intensifies] -[thump] -[music fades] The People's Army controls the village. If they see us, we will be shot. Wait here. I will find Aboud. [sighs] [eerie music] [gasps] [clicking] [Ali] What are you doing there? Come here. Who are you? [grunts] [clicking] -[David] Fatima! -[bang] Do you know her, Sayid? [Sayid] Once before I met this woman. She is from the mission in Beshmael. Did I not tell you, Ali, they're all CIA and have come to assassinate you. Ali! This cancer in Beshmael grows to destroy us. How much longer will you allow it? We leave at first light. [ominous music] [cries out] [groaning and coughing] [labored breathing] [gunshots] Lucky for you, I happened to be in the neighborhood. [David] What are you doing here? [Freeman chuckles] I'm just following your trail from Beshmael. I figure even a priest needs a guardian angel. [chuckles] Guess I was right. [David] Yeah. [grunting] [Freeman] Come on, Miller. Come on. Let's get out of here. [David groaning and gasping] [coughing] -[sheep bleating] -[thump] [rooster crows] Jesus, Bloor. You were supposed to keep an eye on him, not let him go tearing ass over the damn countryside! Well, thank you very much. How was I supposed to know that Fatima was going to take him to Arbat? She worked for you, for Christ's sake! This is not a good thing, my friend. You can bet your ass Aboud will be coming now to take this mission. Every operation is a shoot 'em up to you, isn't it? Well, this is a church, for God's sake. I have made arrangements for help with the local unit of the Christian militia. [Freeman] Yeah? How many men? Seven or eight. [Freeman] Seven or eight! Against Aboud's men? Is this some kind of a joke? [Bloor] Good morning, my dear! Good morning, Father. I say we get the hell out of here. We will be safe here if we show a little finesse. The military thinks that we may have a problem. Zarah, you may go or stay as you please. Well, I'm staying here with you, Father. [Freeman stamps foot] [Bloor chuckles] This wonderful young man that you sent here is an ordained minister. He needn't have been given a weapon. [stutters] This is terrific. [suspenseful music] [motors rumbling] Yo! Wakeup call boys, let's go! Let's go! Company's out. [indistinct chatter] [Freeman] Let's go! Move your backs! [Bloor sighs] I hate it when Freeman is right. A church protected by weapons is not a church! Come on! Around that way! [tense music] [inaudible] [rumbling stop] So what are you going to do? Pray or flight? I'm going to talk to these people. Remember, my first calling was diplomacy. Stop right there and turn back! This is a church, a holy place. Allah would not be pleased. Please... surrender, and no one will be hurt. There are only church people here and we have the support of your government. [dramatic music] [shouts in Arabic] [gunshots] [automatic weapons fire] [automatic weapons fire] [gunshots] [firing] [firing continues] [Zarah sobbing] -[Bloor grunting] -Take it easy. Rest here. Dear boy... [grunts] I think this time I turned the other cheek. How can you not be angry? How can you not retaliate against these people? Maybe I'll understand the next time that we meet. [firing continues] [Zarah sobbing] No! No... [bell rings] [shooting intensifies] All right, everybody into the church! Let's move! [loud boom] [tires screech] [bang] [repeated bangs] [firing continues] [glass shatters loudly] Hey, Miller! Take it. You can't hurt Aboud with a Hail Mary. You better take it. Come on, there is nothing we can do. -Let's go! -[gunfire] Whiteside was right. You fucked up on this! Grenade! [loud boom] [automatic weapons fire] [Freeman keeps shooting] [David] Come on. [Zarah sobbing] [cries out] [sobbing] [indistinct shouts] [dramatic music] [Zarah shrieks] Throw out the weapon! Throw it out! You'll not be harmed. [Zarah groans] [tense music] It is a very good day to die. Is it not? No, Sayid! Take the girl and him. Americans make good hostages. Now! [Zarah sobbing] [Ali] Out. [sharp rap] This belongs to you, I believe. You work for the CIA? And what about the rest of you? More agents of the CIA? Well? You know, without cooperation... there is punishment. -[Zarah whimpers] -[David grunts] -[Zarah] No! -[Ali speaks in Arabic] [David coughing] We'll take them to Arbat and question them there. All but these two. They will stay. Is that understood, Sayid? Now! Take them. [Zarah gasping] [multiple gunshots] Like your friends, it would have been better for you to have died here. Put them in the Jeep. [ominous music] [Ali speaks in Arabic] This will be your home... for as long as you live. Nice, huh? -[Zarah groans] -Enough! An Arab woman who is helping enemies must be punished, Ali! Don't kill her now, Sayid. She can still be of use to us. To start with the Americans. After that... we'll be free to deal with this one. [gasping] [speaking in Arabic] [Zarah whimpering] [sheep and goats bleating] Well, here we are, Miller. Now that we got 'em by the balls, what do you want to do? [ominous music] Ah... Age before beauty, huh? Guess I get to go first. [labored breaths] I hear you Arabs like to eat your dates. [sniffs] [buzzing] [Freeman screaming] [Sayid] Quickly! [door creaks] [Sayid] Bring him. [David] Zarah! [Sayid] Keep moving! [rattling] He is ready, Ali. I know you. We have met before. Rome, I think. You murdered my wife and daughter. Did I? I'm sorry. I don't remember. But you... you I remember. You wore the collar of a cross-worshipper. Where is your collar now, priest? I think I know. You were recruited by the CIA. They sent you to Lebanon to assassinate me. Am I right? Huh? You see what has happened to your friend? It does not have to be this way for you. [Freeman groans] They were innocent. They did nothing to you and you slaughtered them. In today's world... no one is innocent. Not even a man of the cloth. Sayid. [tense music] [sighs] [music builds] -[buzzing] -[David groans] [David yells] [coughing] [gasping] This is not such a pleasant thing. It would be much better for all of us if you just told us what we want to hear. [David gasps] [gasping] Okay. Sayid? [click] Who sent you to Lebanon, priest? Why have you come? [gasping] I've come... to send you straight to hell. [Ali] Enough! [David gasping] He's no good to us dead. Take him back to the cell. This one I wish to question again. -Alone. -[click] Now! [rattling] [rattling] [chair scraping] [shuffling] [Zarah gasps] David... [David groans] [Sayid] Get him up. [tense music] You have betrayed your people, woman. [Freeman grunts] [gasps] [gasps] You have made things difficult for me, CIA man. And so I must make things difficult for you. [breathes heavily] I'm sorry for running up your electric bill, that's all. [Ali] Sayid likes his toys. [Freeman] Yeah. [pained chuckle] Gets his dick hard, right? What to do with Colonel Freeman... [Freeman gasps and groans] [labored breaths] [Ali] I think I have an answer. What are you doing? What's expected of me, Colonel. [suspenseful music] [multiple gunshots] [Zarah sobbing] So much for your CIA friend, huh? [Zarah whimpers] [Zarah cries out] [Sayid] You are a very beautiful woman. [Zarah cries out] That will teach you to help the Americans. Hah! -[Zarah whimpers] -[Ali laughs] Zarah! [Zarah crying out] [Ali laughing] [Zarah screams] [screaming] David! Zarah! -[Zarah screaming] -[Ali laughs] [Zarah gasping] That is better. [Zarah panting] [indistinct whisper] [repeated kisses] -[Ali moans] -[Zarah whimpers] [indistinct whisper] [Zarah gasps] [indistinct whisper] [Ali groans] [Ali grunts] [Ali yells] Did the woman come this way? [gasping] [sighs] [door creaks] Ali... We have one last hostage to interrogate, Sayid. I executed the CIA man. There was nothing more he could tell us. [Ali sighs] Finish with the others. If they cannot tell us what we want... we will dispose of them as well. What is it? The woman has escaped. How? I could not say. The door was open and she was gone. The village is being searched. Let's finish our business. Bring the American, Sayid. And be sure he does not escape, or I will hold you responsible. Go. [suspenseful music] [breathing rapidly] [gear rattling] [door creaks] Tie him down. [shaky breaths] [restraints rattling] [knock at door] We are ready. You handle the priest, Sayid. But when you're finished playing... I want him dead. As you wish. [door creaks shut] [ominous music] I have heard that you cross-worshippers are very fond of confessions. I would like very much to hear one now. [yelling] [scorpion squelches] [gasping] [Ali] Take him outside and shoot him. [grunts] -[buzzing] -[Sayid yells] Zarah? [loud boom] [crashing debris] [click] [sharp tapping] [thumps] [mysterious music] [softly shuffling] [gunshots] [gunshots] [tense music] [glass shattering] [labored breathing] [gasping] -[gunshots] -[groans] [moans] [sharp groans] [labored breathing] -[grunting] -[rattling] [David] Aboud! [sighs] [Ali] Is this a man of God? A man who'd kill another in cold blood? You see... -[clang] -I am unarmed. [breathing heavily] -So was my family. -[cocks gun] Cross-worshipper! [thump] Suck this thing, motherfucker. [gunshots] I thought you were dead. [inhales deeply] We have a friend over here to thank for that. It was his idea. Put down the gun, Miller. This is no bullshit, Miller. Put it down. [Freeman] Now! He works for our side. The CIA doesn't have a more valuable operative than Ali, Miller. I can't let you hurt him. [Ali grunts] On balance, the man has saved more lives than he's taken. Hell of a lot more. I just think it's too bad your wife and kid were in the wrong place at the wrong time. "Too bad"? [gasping] I can't believe you're saying we work with this man! He murdered my family! [Freeman] Sometimes murder is necessary to maintain credibility. I think you know that. [Ali] Finish it, Freeman. Finish what you were sent for! I have orders, my friend. [Ali] Do it, Freeman! Do it now! What are you doing? Kill him! [grunts] [sighs] Go on, get the fuck outta here. [Ali] Kill him, Freeman! You have orders! Fuck orders and fuck you. Go on, get out. If you let him go... [gasping] we are both dead men. Now, Miller, before I change my mind! No! [David grunts] [Ali] You think you have won. You see? We go to hell together. Hey, priest! [chuckles] [Ali laughs] Together! [laughing] [boom] -[boom] -[falling debris] [boom] [tense music] [boom] [boom] [boom] Get in! Come on! [boom] [gunshots] [repeated booms] [bell ringing] [birds chirping] [organ music] [David] Reverend Hughes? My God! My God, David! Have you really come back? You're leaving the Church. Just for a while. Are you certain that this is what you want to do? I need some time. [sighs heavily] Perhaps you'd better tell them. [sniffs] [organ music swells] [Hughes] Today my good friend David is with us. And he has some important words to share with you. [clears throat] There was a time when I could stand up here... and it seemed like I had all of the answers. But beyond these walls our choices in life aren't always so clearly defined. There's a real world out there with real people, real heartache, and very, very real pain. Where there is doubt, faith grows weak. My faith has grown weak. My friends, I won't be seeing you for a while. I need time to rediscover... to rediscover that which I have lost. And God willing, one day I will return. Till that day... may God bless... and keep... you and all of those that you love. [low piano notes] [uplifting music] [music fades]
