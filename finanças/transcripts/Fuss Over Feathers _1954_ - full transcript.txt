Ah Perdita, where's Sally? Morning Harry, morning Mrs. Tilney. - Morning Sally. - Morning Sally. Perdita told me you were coming. She tells me everything, even more than Mrs. Thompson. She'd have to be a great talker to do that. What's this? Just the correspondence you dictated. What correspondence? The protest to the river board, the complaints to the county council and the letter to the tax people. I had to leave poor Bookie's work right in the middle of a chapter to get those done. Are you still writing the Norfolk story? That'll never get finished. Now what about those letters? Well I can't say as I recollect given them to you Sally. But Harry you said yesterday they were so import... Oh yesterday. Were one of my red Thursdays. Don't you take no count what I say on my red Thursdays. But it was so early. You looked sober and your wife said... Oh, well, don't you take no notice of what any of them say. Every other Thursday it is, when my pension comes through. I drink it, see. Not out of gratitude for the government. I swallows it all down to blast their eyes, for giving an old sailor such a paltry cheese bearing screw-a-lolly, every time gets it I sees red. And that's why it's red Thursday. And don't we know it. Harry Tilney. Harry Tilney. Have you heard about the notice? - What notice? - They've put up a notice. I just had to tell you. It's about the Island of Children. The Island of Children, what is it Mrs. Thompson? Everyone says it's awful. Something about acquisition. Meddling officials. Why can't they leave us alone. That's what everyone's saying. I just had to tell you. I told Harry Tilney. He's coming right now. Hey, Bookie, what's all this about land acquisitions? Exceeding their powers. That's what they're doing. Don't worry, we'll fix it. If they're talking about acquiring the Island of Children, you're not gonna be away long are you? My dear, I have to gather material for the Norfolk Story. Such work takes a great deal of time. There's the Director of Little Wimberton to see. Oh but Bookie. Hey Bookie, wait a minute! This is serious! Is it true, Harry? Tyranny, that's what it is, tyranny. Hold on a bit, Harry, before you blows your top off. You know I can't read them things without me glasses. What's it all about? It's the Ministry of Land Acquisition. It says, notice is hereby given that the Air Ministry are proposing to purchase an area of land known as the Island of Children for the purpose of an air firing range. Should any person have legitimate objections to the proposed range, then such objections should be made known to the Ministry of Land Acquisition, Whitehall, London. Daft that is. No one's got no right to do that. They can't know what the Island of Children means. If they knew that they wouldn't fire on it wouldn't they? Nobody ever shot a thing on the Island of Children. Not even Smother Brooks here, have you Smother? That would be back luck wouldn't. Doubt if I'd sleep if anyone ever shot there. Island of Children is ours. Aye, has been for a thousand of years. Sally take a letter. You can now all here what I'm gonna say to the Ministry of Land Acquisition. Well, wouldn't it be better to talk to the RAF at Fallowfield? Alright, we'll talk to them hey. What is the name of the Air Force boss. Well the boss is Wing Commander Rogers, but Bill says Mr. Parsons is in charge of the flying. Ha ha, Bill hey. I forgot you had an interest in the RAF. I choose my own friends, Harry Tilney, even if I do write other people's letters. Alright, mate, alright. Now look, how'd it be if you was to ring up the RAF, and tell them the chairman of the parish council would like a word with them. Like we did on the Armistice Day service. Alright, I'll do it now. I promised her I'd be back early for lunch. Aye, and tell your dad the Ministry of Acquisition wants his mill, for target, see. Hello Perdita. So they've gone and got their grips on the Island of Children hey? How did you know? Mrs. Thompson phoned me. I bet that's panicked them. Just takes a ministry or a bit of brass tape. Red tape. These Norfolk people wouldn't say boo to a goose, not if it looked like an official bird. But the Island of Children is a sanctuary. Well there're such places in Suffolk, but nobody I ever heard of turned into target areas. Norfolk people's too full of poetry. Who did they get practical to run a pumping station? Me from sunny Suffolk. They'll do something about it this time. - Poor Perdita she hates it. - Poor Perdita. Them people's against the laws of nature. That's what I said to young Bill. I think that was Bill. I thought you said he was ground staff. What's he doing up there? He's just crazy about flying. He's colorblind, though, and can't get into aircrew so he looks after Squadron Leader Parsons' aeroplane. Sometimes Mr. Parsons takes him up for a trip. Crazy about flying. Why? He tried to tell me about it. Something to do with the sky. I don't know. I suppose he feels he's sharing it with Perdita. Well, I've been enough years at sea. Tower to Archer One, clear to taxi in. Both engines running as smooth as silk. The old Meteor almost as good as the Vampire now corporal. Which all snags were as easy as that, sir. Gave me next to no trouble. Thanks for the flight, sir, and the erm, you know. That's alright, she's a nice girl. Both flights, Corporal speaks the Mk.7 alright. Aah, well that's something anyways sir. I just came to tell you the Adjutant phoned up. CO wants to see you. Why doesn't he see the flight. Somebody been checking the maintenance infantry again. Aye, nearly as bad as that sir. There's been a signal grounding all our Vampires. What's it all about? Well, the squadron converted to ground attack. Ground attack? Never a dull moment. List of modifications as long as my arm. Rocket rails, new side mods, armor. Well, it's all very well. What's the flap? Well, no flap at all. All just as simple as ABC. Well it seems to have put the skids on Parsons. I bet it's conversion to ground attack. Well, trust a cockney to make a safe bet. Easy as ABC hey? All our kind back in pieces. Oh well, I suppose we'll have to have a reshuffle and a new deal. Yeah, that's what I'd like, a reshuffle. And deal me a few mechanics next time instead of schoolboys from handy craft classes. Squadron Leader Parsons just got in sir. Alright, ask him to come in. Aye, sir. Heard the glad tidings, Johnny? Conversion to ground attack hey. What's the gen sir? In a nutshell, three weeks for conversion. That'll need some tight organizing. That's right. What's the panic. You've then got four weeks to attain maximum efficiency. And then? That's all. What about air training? We need a range. Looks as if some clever character's thought it all out in advance. They're giving us a piece of wasteland near the coast. It's called an island for some odd reason. Anyway it's the other side of Wadley Broad. Then we shan't waste time getting there. When do we start? Now. How far did you say this place was? With this wind we should make it inside an hour. That was quite smart. You'll make a sailor yet. One thing I have learned. You can't kiss a girl while you're sailing a boat. Bad luck. So? Next up the Island of Children. We'll have to paddle down to the end of the channel. What's so special about this place? Tell you when we get there. Sounds mysterious. Where's Predita? She's probably waiting for us. You see she lives there. She lives at the mill. No, I mean it's where she was born. Oh, so we're visiting the ancestral home hey. Think she'll give us tea? Silly, whoever heard of a seagull making tea. They drink coffee. Whoever heard of two people talking such nonsense. Whoever heard of a girl being so fond of a boy who talks such nonsense. Oh Bill, don't go in, Bill, come back. - See what I mean? - Yes. Sit down fellas. Very shortly this is it. The CO has had orders that the squadron turns over from fighter defense to ground attack. That means rockets. We have to modify the aircraft, fit the rockets, learn to use them and practice the tactics. We haven't got much time and we start now. What will interest all of you is that we do it all here. The range will be this piece of land, known locally as the Island of Children, though it doesn't say so on the map. It's like a different world. It is different. A world on its own with all sorts of tales and legends about it. Sally, it's always legends in the past with you. You like a world of your own, don't you? Don't you ever find now and tomorrow just as exciting? Sometimes, perhaps. But this is different. I love this place. I love you, Sally. Listen. Quite ghostly isn't it. The old people say there are spirits here. You mean it's haunted. Well, not ghosts, just children at peace. The Island of Children. Yes. Tell me about it. The Romans came here nearly 2,000 years ago. Then it was a beautiful shallow lake. They used it for burying their dead children. I didn't know that. Well, gradually a part of the lake became silted up and formed an island. Nobody quite knows when it happened, probably hundreds of years ago. Anyway, no one's ever used the place since even though it has now become a part of the mainland. Sort of consecrated ground. Is that why all the birds are here? Yes, they've been breeding here for centuries. All Pertita's ancestors. No one shoots them. - I suppose they feel... - They believe the birds here are the souls of the Roman children. Yes, it has got that feeling about it. Can we look? Yes, they're not nesting now. Perdita. We could do with that cup of tea. - Coffee. - Sorry, coffee. - Poor Perdita. - Why poor Perdita? Bill, did you know the Air Force were going to make a target range? Well, I knew we'd need one now we've converted to ground attack, but Sally, not this place. Well, they mustn't, they can't. You can see what it is, what it means, the sanctuary. Yes. It wouldn't be too bad. The targets would go over by those trees. The range control that bank over there. That's just about the right distance. Stop it, you can't! Sally, don't look at me like that. Well, don't you look at the Island of Children like that. Well, I can't do anything. Well, you sounded so pleased as if you wanted a range here. Well, it'll have to go somewhere, and in England there's so little land left. Well they can't have this bit, and they won't get it. No, I have a feeling they won't. I've never seen you like this before. Do you like me better this way? I like you any way. And don't get angry too often, you scare me. I'd like to scare the Air Force. Well, they don't scare very easily. It's not marked as a sanctuary. Marked. Meddling officials, they mark what they pleases. Can't expect no help from them. Well, it's very difficult you know. We can only accept what we're given. And even if we did have a choice, what alternatives are there in this area? Why can't you fire in the sea like we did in the Navy? Well, you can't observe results for one thing. And what about the fishermen? No, water's no good for ground attack. Well then, you best find some other place. But what happens if everyone says that? They do you know, it's always try somewhere else. The services are nearly always wrong. Oh not in wartime I grant you. Then there's patriotism. Patriotism. That means a lot of meddling officials. But it needn't Mr. Tilney. It just means seeing that your country is safe and prosperous and that means everyone doing his job to the best of his ability. My job is with the Air Force. Look here. We're not doing all this for fun. Those men and aircraft always have to be ready and prepared. Sometimes you know we haven't as much time as we think. That's why we insist on order and preparedness. Here, how you getting along with that? Shouldn't take more than a couple of hours now Chiefy. I wouldn't take that long if we had another pair of hands. Here, let's have none of that. That job don't barely need two of ya. Another pair of hands. Now what does he know about people working with their hands. You should see him washing up at the back of the pub trying to get sweet with Fanny. Wants her to go for a bike ride with him. If I was him I'd buy her a washing up machine first. We're gonna fly past the order and preparedness. Are they part of the day? No, it's all been on and off, day in and day out sir. All bitter and twisted again. Bet you finish on time all the same. No, well it's trying to be everywhere at once sir. List of mods as long as my arm, and, well where are the men coming from? You've never had a keener bunch of men fly. Ah, and what if we do finish the job on time? What happens about the rocketing? Well the range's trouble, that's a snag. Corporal, did you know about the sanctuary? Oh, not until yesterday sir, when I erm, I mean, we sailed up there. Oh and er, we're a bit upset about it are we? Well, everybody's upset sir. Er, excuse me sir. I knew about the sanctuary a long time ago. There's a type in the village called Smother Brooks. The flight sergeant knows him. He told me. They can't use it now that they know what it is can they sir? I couldn't say. That's up to the Ministry of Land Acquisition. Air Ministry again Miss Flew. This is Jessop's pigeon, definitely Jessop's pigeon. I know Mr. Wentworth. But since Mr. Jessop's on leave, the minister's asked for you to handle the matter. The private office needs a report by tomorrow afternoon. It's just so difficult, so very difficult. My own position on the Committee of the National Bird Watching Society is so well known in the ministry. And indeed in Whitehall. The minister understands that. But with Mr. Jessop away. Hmm, the ball is really in our court is it. Well well what's needed? Air Ministry has just asked for a report. The minister wants you to investigate the title, then check with the Nature Conservancy and the usual routine. - Mr. Jessop's already... - Oh confound Jessop. Why do people always have to go on leave at the most inconvenient times. He knows I shouldn't handle anything to do with sanctuaries. The matter is flagged as urgent, Mr. Wentworth. And don't you think it's a dreadful thing if they are going to fire guns and rockets and things where there's all that bird life? Of course, that's the point. I feel so strongly that I shouldn't have to handle the matter. Oh confound Jessop. It really is his pigeon. Sally, here, get your notebook. I'm gonna write a letter to someone. The Island of Children, you've heard? - What's the news? - What's it all about? - Now listen all of you. - What do they say now, Harry? Why don't you read it yourself. I ain't got my glasses. - No you wouldn't. - Come on out with it. - What is it. - Well, these here fine gentlemen say they've investigated all the facts of the objection and they ain't gonna do a blind thing about it. Government people talking like that. They say there's no clear title to the land but assume it's crown land. What's a title? Like my lord or sir. Sir Island of Children sounds daft. Oi shut up, now the conservancy people who ought to know better have told them it's not an official sanctuary, there being two in existence. Anyway, the purchase of the land for an air firing range is going ahead forthwith and as far as they're concerned we can like it or lump it. Give us a drink Joe. So they really gonna shoot at them birds? After so many thousands of years. Well, it'll bring them nothing but bad luck. Well everything's gotta change sooner or later. I think you're making a lot of fuss about nothing. Nothing, this is the most important thing that's happened to us. Pity you don't think the same about your work. Well who are we gonna write to then? I wonder where Bookie is. He might be able to help. Well, let's try and phone him at Little Wimberton. Use my phone, call's on the house. Thanks Joe. Give us all a drink, Joe. Yes, forthwith. Here what do we do if Bookie can't help us? What do we do? Huh, that's just like you Norfolk dumplings. Why if this was Suffolk every man jack would be up and doing. Doing what? Playing follow-my-leader like a lot of silly Suffolk sheep hey. No, rebellion most likely. We don't sit down and grizzle against the government. We ups and beats them about the head. When for instance? Didn't we turn out for Wat Tyler, for Jack Kidd, and Oliver Cromwell. Suffolk's always been against the government. A bit of rebellion, that's what you need. Chalk 'em up Joe. Did he say Oliver Cromwell? I thought someone said he were dead. Aye, he is. But the news hasn't reached Suffolk yet. - Oh. - Evening. - The usual? - Thanks Joe. Quiet evening, what's happened to everybody? Come in a moment ago you'd have had them talking rebellion. What's the trouble? Well it seems it's that firing range of yours. Why can't they leave us alone. Wish we had 'em here, a whole bullion Of them. Dratted meddling officials. It's tough luck you know but er, we need a firing range and soon. It isn't a sanctuary you know. I checked it myself on all the local maps. You mean it has to be marked on a map? Well that's not all. Some official body, the Conservancy or bird watchers or someone like that, has to declare it to be a sanctuary. Bookie left Little Wimberton yesterday and the rector doesn't know where he's gone. Well it seems the only thing's a flaming rebellion like your dad suggests. Here, Sally, Harry, I've got an idea. First for 70 years, should be a masterpiece. All you gotta do is to get it made into a bird sanctuary. But it is one. Everyone knows that. But you gotta make it official see. - Official! - There's the Conservancy. Not them. Now wait a bit, there's the Bird Watching Society. That's an idea. We could write to them. Well, if it comes to a choice between the bird watchers and the flaming rebellion which is the only other suggestion we've had, it best be the bird watchers huh. Unless this Island of Children, rather a charming name, what, is rescued by our efforts, yet another slice of our national heritage will be swallowed up. Well, isn't this a matter for our respected chairman? But I... I always understood you had a hide in Norfolk. On your brother's land, Mr. Wentworth. - That's true but... - Well, do you mean that nice Colonel Wentworth, the your office be the one to. Do you think I really ought to go Miss Flew? Under the circumstances Mr. Wentworth, I don't see why, Mr. Wentworth feels a little reluctant owing to the fact that he's er, involved officially. Oh but you don't mean to say... Well this is really Jessop's pigeon. Erm, that is to say it's not really my pigeon but for the fact that my colleague Mr. Jessop, happens to be away. But surely, that wouldn't prevent you paying a private visit to your brother, the Colonel. No, I can't go. I really mustn't. Now, Fanny as I was saying, you need someone like meself, who knows the world. Someone with maturity. Have you heard? The bird watchers are coming. There's been a letter. Bird watchers, what for? Oh can't stop now, might miss something. Hey, what's it all about. Huh, something to do with the range I fancy. Outside with the flight sergeant she is a one. Yesterday it was Buster. What's the name of this Cove? - Wentworth. - Wentworth? Who's he? The man from the Bird Watching Society. He's there chairman. There used to be a Wentworth living the other side of Reedham, a colonel. Now who did he marry? Well what's wrong? You all look so glum. Mr. Wentworth is coming tomorrow. - Well? - Red Thursday. How the blazes are we gonna keep Harry Tilney sober? Well, I can't refuse to serve him if he comes in here. Not unless he's incapable. Be against the law. Besides, you pull the place back over my head. Can try to keep him busy all day. Don't give him a free moment to get a drink. Hey that's an idea but it won't be too easy. Don't worry, I'll see he keeps at it. It's time I put an end to these red Thursdays of his. Hello, what's that? Hey what are they Bill, Swifts? Yes. I wonder what they're doing over here. They're stations in Devon. I suppose they've got nothing to do for half a minute so they thought they'd pop over. Who's flying them sir? Davidson, they'll be down in a minute. Refueling? More than that. You'll be moving out from here as the ground attack course is completed. Overseas. That's it. Does that mean action sir? Probably I'm not quite sure yet. But the squadron has to be ready to move as soon as training is complete. That's why it's so urgent. By the way that's secret for the present. Ah, let's get this finished. Gee Bee says we can have the rest of the day to ourselves when this is done. Are you going swimming? Yeah. Oh, I told the girls we'd meet them over there. Fine. Are they taking the field over from us sir? Yes. Better get over to meet them. - Hello Davy. - Hello sir. I don't believe it, the man from Mars. Meet Johnny Parsons. He'll be moving his squadron out to make room for you. - Hello. - Hello old boy, how are you? Well where are all your aeroplanes? - Oh they're on the apron. - What those? Huh, I thought those were the target dummies. Probably part of the party hey. You'll need refueling I suppose. - Yes please, sir. - Alright. Let's show him his new homes, shall we. Good oh. Oh, by the way sir, I have to be back in Devon at six. Let me know when it's five to would you. Oh, oh I wish I'd brought my bike. Then I wouldn't have to hurry. Oh what's the flap anyway, Fanny. Well, governor's hut. And there's only me to open the pub. Blimey, the times I've waited for half past five but tonight I wish they didn't open 'til half past seven. If you worked behind a bar every day of your life, you'd wish it was half past nine. Well that's where I can do a roaring trade round the back like your old man does. I'd put a glass washing machine in for a start though. You'd do great things. Thought you were gonna fix dad's old motorboat. Well, er, I'm going to and all. Well get on with it. We might take her out. Hey that's a good idea. I could make that old tub do 50. Come on. - Oh, bye. - I'll see you - back there Bill. - Bye. - What? - Just you. - Footsteps. - Yeah. I always do it. Can I have my towel? Do my back please. Oh look. That must be the highest sky in the world. It's my favorite piece of sky. The only bit I've ever flown in. Tell me about it. I can't, I haven't got the words. I don't suppose anyone has them. It's a kind of uplift. Perhaps it needs music, soaring music. My mother used to talk like that about, sometimes after the singing in chapel. It's the same thing in a way. You see Sally, now you won't laugh. No I won't laugh. Well, man started by mastering the land and learning to walk. Then he learned to sail the sea. Now it's the air. All the time man is growing in stature. Perhaps I mean dignity. And gaining sort of, getting closer to something. I can see it all more clearly lying here on the earth. Yes. Yes, I suppose you see more than I do. And we're different Sally. You're a dreamer, I'm a doer. I sometimes wonder. If there was less striving, wouldn't there be less hurt done to people? Sanctuary. Yes, I suppose it all boils down to that really. Doers and dreamers. I want progress and you... Me. I love you. Rockets are a form of long range artillery. When attacking airfields, go for the hangers and larger buildings. A full salvo fired along the length of a hanger will bring it down and flatten all the aircraft underneath. Approach with the target on the port bow, and give standby to dive on the RT. Press the camera button immediately the sight is steady on the target. The last frame of the cine film taken at the moment of firing is used for assessing the angle of dive, the height of release, and the slant range. It also indicates inaccuracies in flying. Okay, let's have some lights. Well you can see it's comparatively easy with targets such as hangers. There's no problem of deflection there. And even with ships, you have the bow wave to help you. Well it's a bit tough on the matlow sir. Don't worry too much about them. They usually pack enough flak to keep your mind on other things. Anything else? How do you estimate speed of deflection with tanks? I mean with ships there's a bow wave. Only as I said just now, lots and lots of practice. The only way you can get that is with practical flying. That's why I want the theory cleared up pronto. So get down to it and study it really hard. Anything else sir? That's all fellas. - Huh. - Oh. - Oh. - Oh. I'll have them ready for the range if they have to sit up all night. Nice work Johnny. The aircraft are coming along pretty well. Even managed to give some time off to the past workers. That's Flight Sergeant Campbell, peddling around like the prophet of doom. He always has the job bang on schedule. There's one small snag however. The hold up on radio equipment for the range. - Oh? - We've ordered a 5391 but they're a bit short just now. We may have to rig up something temporary for the first few days. What about the range itself? Oh, tricky still. I was thinking of going over there for a ground recce tomorrow sir. I suppose that's alright. Yes, as far as I'm concerned the place is ours. Don't get mixed up with any of those Roman children. - Hello there! - Hello sir. Taken up bird watching? No just having a look round. Hello Sally. Quite a place isn't it? I'm glad you like it Mr. Parsons. That's your tame gull. Heard a lot about him. It's a she sir. - Sorry. - She's called Perdita. That's hardly a local name is it. Not really but you see Perdita was born here on the Island of Children. I see and you gave her a Latin name because of the Romans. It's more special than that. You see the Romans once had a camp, somewhere over there. According to Bookie, who's our local expert on these matters, they were threatened one night by sudden flooding. As the water was creeping up on them, a child who'd wondered from her parents began to cry like a lost soul and woke them. So they were able to save themselves. And all because of the child, Perdita. I wish in a way you were Perdita could save the feathers on the Island of Children. But I'm afraid it looks as if we're going ahead. You may not be. We've got the chairmen of the Bird Watching Society coming down tomorrow. I hope he can help you. But as the corporal here knows, we need a range urgently. By the way, you know this place pretty well, what's the ground like over there? It's alright, Perdita. The bird's almost human. I think you better let me explore this place myself huh. Perhaps you're right sir. I'm sorry about this but it's not really up to me. Doesn't seem to be up to anyone. There's always someone higher up. Good luck with the bird watchers. What's the name of this fellow? Wentworth. And don't worry Mr. Parsons, you'll find somewhere else for your range when we win this. Appointments for today, Mr. Wentworth. Er, Thursday. Nothing until the train at 3:15. - Train? - For Saltingsby. The bird sanctuary. Oh yes, er what's the fellows name? - Mr. Tilney. - Tilney. Well, that sounds a solid, reliable name. This is going to be his first sober Thursday. I kept him hard at it all the morning. No not a drink. I hid what was in the house. He's in a difficult mood, though. What? Oh he made an excuse to go and see Old Circular. Your box. 10, 15-2 to you. Tut, ah, tsk. Hey, Harry, half a mo, we haven't finished. Hey Harry come back. Harry, Harry! Harry got away. I done my best. Let him lick me for three games that even a bloomin' baby could've won. Er, no not a drink. Temper, it's rising. It was Sally. She's met with Sir Wentworth and he's on his way here. She wanted to know if Harry was here yet. He should be. It's over two hours since I sent him on that wild goose chase to Reedsly. Well what could've happened to him? - Weight lifting. - Trying to be funny? Might give you a hand if you're agreeable. Agreeable. Would you be agreeable if you're stuck in a ditch seven miles from the nearest pub? Ooh, we're worried about a spot of refreshment are we. Quarter Master to the rescue. Never travel without it when they are long distances between one point of human comfort and another. Learned that in the desert. If you'd been in the desert... Well I've been at sea. Reckon that's no worse. Oh matlow hey. Pongo hey, well to hell with the Air Force. My name's Colonel Wentworth. Well mine's Harry Tilney. And to hell with the Air Force. Want another spot matlow? Well, I'll just have a drop. And then maybe give me a hand, pull her out of the ditch hey. An appointment is an appointment Mrs. Tilney. I can't think what's happened to my husband, Mr. Wentworth. He's never late, least ways. The trouble is I'm being fetched. What ya cox. What's wrong? That gentleman there's waiting for Harry Tilney. Well where's he got to? That's what we all want to know. I know what's happened. Here, today's Thursday isn't it? Thursday? - Yes, why? - Well, every other Thursday... Wouldn't the gentleman like to see round the churchyard? I have already been round the churchyard, twice. Er perhaps you'd like another glass of ginger wine, sir? On the house, I mean. Oh, well, perhaps I might. To hell with the RAF. And our meddling officials. Oh, I'm afraid my brother's a, oh just as you say, old fella. To hell with all the meddling officials. We've looked everywhere and telephoned. I can't imagine what's happened. But as you know Mr. Wentworth, I act as secretary to the parish council and... In that case, I certainly think our discussion ought to commence. Though it's hardly the most satisfactory place. Well, we can sit over here. Yes, over here. It's a problem it seems to me of official recognition. Oh, let it ring. Er you were saying sir. Official recognition. Er recognition officially. Now, we of the... - Where have you been? - About time if you ask me. Looks like he's found some somewhere. We waited for you but... So, so, you're the bird watcher, hey. I I'm chairman of the National... Name of Wentworth I believe. That's my name. Mr. Wentworth of the Ministry of Land Acquisition hey. - You're not being very... - Come down here to rob us and disguised yourself as a bird watcher hey. Well, there's not question of disguise. Meddling officials what's this if it isn't a disguise? - Does he walk with it? - I'll show you what I do with meddling officials. Really, as chairman of the... That's what I think of meddling officials! I hardly think ladies and gentlemen that this is quite the moment of... Anyone here called Wentworth? That's me. There's a drunk outside with the same name. - Drunk? - Wants you to drive him home. Oh well, in that case ladies and gentlemen, I ought to explain but I I I... Get out! Isn't nobody gonna answer that phone? Joe! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Harry, wasting all our time like this. You ought to be glad I got rid of him. Ministry of Land Acquisition. Well, that's the end of the Bird Watching Society. I keep telling you this is soapy. There's someone in here nattering about something. Why don't you listen to what they've got to say. I ain't never listened to one of them things in me life. You hold onto it. People telephones me now. Nice pass. Bloke at the other end's getting proper narked. Hello? I'm sorry, we haven't quite got your message straight. Who is this speaking? - It's Bookie! - Bookie! Well, let me speak. He's getting me the message he says once and for all. What's that? Of dunderheads. Oh sorry sir, I know what you're talking about now. The Island of Children of course. Yes. Tell Soapy the eel catcher, it's a tidal river. The fishing rights were granted to the people by King Henry VIII. No power, military or otherwise, can stop the people, tell Soapy, from exercising that right. As a professional eel catcher he has every right to establish himself on the Island of Children. What's that? You can't go on talking forever. He was in a call box. Now what he means is that Soapy here... I know what Bookie means. He means for me to claim me true right. You mean, they can't put a range there if Soapy moves in and claims the right? That's about it. Oh, Bill! Hey, it isn't him, it's me. Oh, Soapy. First umbrellas, then telephone calls, now being kissed. I don't know what the world's coming to and that's flat. I suppose you've got a head this morning. Fine chairman of the parish council you are. No need to worry about Wentworth. Now Soapy's decided to squat, we'll beat the RAF yet. Pity you aren't as keen on your business as you are on being the Air Force. There's more to life than making money. Don't tell me you really care what happens to the sanctuary. Just 'cause I shout sometimes and put on a bit of an act you think I've got no feelings. I know that place since my old grandad took me there when I first started to walk. That legend, that's the first thing any kid around here's told. I don't know, taking it away would be like saying there weren't gonna be no Christmas. There'd be something missing for all of us. Eat your breakfast. Hello Edwards. How does the layout strike you? It's a bit makeshift sir, but I suppose it'll do. At least when the barrier's down no one will be able to get here unless they've got a boat. Nice comfortable hut, fine range of targets, what more do you want? Communications mostly. Oh yes, I hear the radio equipment won't be here for another 10 days. And Sierra says we can't delay so I've got a sort of a boy scouts telephone wire put up. So long as it does the job 'til the proper gear arrives. - Sir. - Yes, how's it going sergeant? - Snag's up. - Snag? What do you want, more men? No sir, it's an eel catcher sir. Eel catcher? Whoa, feathered friends. Yes, I know it's a bit hard on the birds. Eel catcher, now that's the fella with the long beak isn't it Edwards? No sir. Excuse me sir, it's a man, with a hut sir. What? He's squatting on the riverbank sir. A man with a hut? Well, it's more like a boat sir. He said he was given the right to put it there by King Henry VIII sir. - Hmm? - King Henry VIII? Let's see this fellow, I'll give him Henry VIII. If King Henry VIII says I can stay here, then here I stays. But he's been dead hundreds of years. Hey? Well, you might be right, and you mightn't. All I know is he was the one that gave them fishing rights to the people. No power, military or otherwise, can stop the people from, what's it now, exit, oh dang it, what I mean is, from using that right. I myself, as a professional eel catcher, has every to establish myself on the Island of Children. You sound as if you've had some coaching. And there's another thing. I can't get me proper sleep with all this banging and hammering going on. What, sleeping during working hours? Eels is caught be night. Everyone knows that. What, can't we make a friendly arrangement about this? There's plenty of other tidal water where you can fish. Here I be and here I rest. I know, Henry VIII. Hey, King Henry VIII said, no power... I've got your new umbrella. Ooh, Henry VIII. I'm sorry, but that Saltingsby case is once again flagged urgent. It really is Jessop's pigeon. Isn't he ever going to come back. Next Monday, but it's too late. It's this question of a common right. As you see, the private office wants an investigation of the claim at once. So long as I don't have to go back to that dreadful bar. You'll want the treasury's solicitor. Yes yes indeed. 805 please. Of course Miss Flew, one's personal feelings must never intrude but when I think of the Island of Children, that great expanse of sky, never a ripple to disturb the ancient calm. - Wonderful! - Easy as kiss me. - Better than bikes? - No! - Slow down! - Slow down! - Get away, get away! - The throttle's jammed! - Hey, look out, look out! - Look out! Look where you're going! - Oh! - Sorry, mate. Can't stop it! - Sorry Fanny! - You want to kill us! Blimey I can't even switch it off! - Look, Buster! - What's he doing? That way! - Go that way! - Can't stop it! Hey what about the speed limit! - The throttle's jammed! - Buster slow down! See you in South End Bill! Do something! - You take the wheel! - Not me! Well I can't fix it and stear. I'm not gonna stear at this speed! Oh, this is a big loss this is. I can't even budge it. - Look out! - Argh! Blimey, that's torn it. You couldn't kept a lookout! That's right, blame me. Oh well, it stopped the engine anyway. Of all the daft things. Easy as kiss me. Blimey, it'll take a working party to shift it. Well then, you get one. I'm sticking to bikes. Oh Fanny, you can't go with camel after the speed I got outta this. Oh, can't I. I've never had to walk home from a bike ride. Ooh! Poor old Buster, something always goes wrong for him. Things are going right for us, aren't they? Old Perdita seems to think so anyway. You've got Soapy to thank for this. And really of course Bookie. - Bill? - Yeah. I went to the Island of Children the other night. And I was thinking of what we were talking about on the beach that day. The flying, I remember. Yes. And it seemed to me, all of a sudden, that perhaps we were both really after the same thing, you and I. It's just that we're going in opposite directions to look for it. You mean, what I said about man getting nearer to something, something we may find in flying. Yes. I wonder if that's why I'm love with that other world. People seem to be getting further and further away from something that's simple and somehow true. We might even have to go right back to the beginning to find it. Can't stop Sally. That would be against nature, like your dad says. Bookie says some people used to stop and give themselves time to think. Monks and philosophers and people. I don't see you as a monk, or a philosopher. Now you're laughing at me. No I'm not. Just smiling. - Why? - Because I'm happy. Do I make you happy Bill? Don't ever go away Bill. Sally, there is a rumor at the station that... - Soapy! - Soapy. Now what's he doing here? Hello Soapy, what's up? Is anything wrong? What's up? Policeman came this morning and read this letter to me. What is it? You best take it. I ain't got me glasses. Your claim to a common right has been investigated and it has been found there is no local knowledge of any such privilege. It is therefore regretted that you must immediately remove from the area as your presence clearly constitutes a trespass. Oh, Soapy. I done all I could. I done everything Bookie said in his message. No you couldn't have done more. I'm afraid you're beaten now. I won't be beaten. Well, Sally darling, face the facts. Facts have got nothing to do with it. They're just determined to have the land. Well please look at their point of view... I don't want to know. Let's get back to Harry Tilney's and get everyone together. - Well, what's the good... - Are you coming or not? - Alright, let's go. - We'll all meet - at the boatyard. - Right. To hell with the public inquiry. I'm through with meddling officials. That's all very well but isn't this just a meeting of protest? Or are we gonna do something? - If Bookie were here... - It's legal nonsense that's beaten you all along. Hey, maybe Bookie had the right idea. Here, would you go back there if some of us went with ya? I ain't gonna be shot up be no airplanes. What's your idea, Smother? - Ah, it's just a notion. - Come on, out with it. No, wait a bit. Yeah, Bill, you're in the Air Force. Would you let us know when they aim to use that range? - Well, I erm, - well, you're on our side ain't ya? Yes, but er, I couldn't give information about an RAF operation. But Smother only wants to know when they're going to use the range. I'm sorry, Sally, I can't do it. You can't? I want to see the Island of Children saved. I can't give away Air Force information though. - You mean you won't. - Now steady on there. Anybody who's ever been in the services knows he can't do that. You've been a matlow yourself Harry. Aye, that's right enough. I mean a chap's gotta be loyal to his service, even if it is the Air Force. Alright, stay here and talk talk talk but remember I got a notion that means action, if someone will tell me when the Air Force is gonna use the range. Well, who's for a beer. Steady. Sorry, I have to desert you chaps like this. This conference in group is important though. The AOC wants to know about the range too. You might have a word about the radio equipment sir. I'll do what I can. You like everything buttoned up don't you? Already to press on? Here's the whole scheme. Not too bad for a temporary job. - Here's the hut here. - Yes. Those are the targets. I've got a clear view on them. And that's a landline, runs across the water there. Is it quite safe? No one uses the water sir, and it'll only be in use for a couple of days. From there, signals have rigged a direct line to flying control. - Good. - When will you be back sir? Sometime tomorrow afternoon, later I imagine. We'll be well on the way by then. I'll do a solo test in the morning then leaver sections during the afternoon. How about the safety precautions? All in hand, sir, notices have been posted and the flag will go up tomorrow morning an hour before Johnny makes the first round. Dad! What? Bookie, thank heavens you're here. Nearly too late from what Soapy here has been telling me. It is too late, look. What's the flag for? It means they're using the rang today. Exceeding their powers. I've been doing some private investigating and found some interesting facts. - In 1537... - King Henry VIII hey. For one who claims to have no education, you're astonishingly accurate. In that year, the churches were suppressed and their lands taken over by the crown. - History! - Quiet. Let's here what he's got to say. A few years later during Kett's Rebellion of 1549, because of local support given by St. Benets Abbey, some land was returned to the church. So he did support Kett's Rebellion hey. We helped to put it down. The point is this. That the Island of Children is part of the land that was returned to the Abbey. It's church land, not crown land. And that's no guarantee it won't be used as a firing range. Well, our presentation of the facts will at least delay it being used. But they start firing today! We gotta tell the Air Force right away. - Give us a lift. - Certainly. Come on Sally, I might want to write a letter. - Anyone else? - Where's Perdita? Come along, we haven't got time for that. - All okay, sir? - Yeah. And the old bus on the flight test, she was as sweet as a bird. You've done a good job on her Corporal. You're not wearing your Mae West sir. No, I'm not going near the sea, just to the range and back. This is victory for the Air Force hey sir? Yes, but we're all very sorry it had to be that place. The girlfriend is upset I suppose. I remember seeing you there together. The place does something to you sir. Well, I better get cracking. I've got to contact the range control at half past exactly. Good luck. Pretend it's a tropical jungle sir. You fellow know too much for your own good. - Contact. - Contact. I'm sorry sir but as I thought the Station Commander's away. - You past on our message? - I spoke to the Adjutant sir and explained why you'd come, he'll see you right away. Corporal. - Come this way sir. - Right. Tower to Archer Leader, clear to take off. Wish it was the old Meteor he was flying. I haven't been up for three weeks. If you'd kept your eyes on the ground, you might've seen Sally. - Sally here? - Yeah, I saw her over at SHQ with Tilney and that other bloke erm, - Bookie? - Bookie, that's it. Oh, and she sent a message for you Bill. Apparently this Bookie's come back and says it's church land, nothing to do with the ministry at all. No, I bet she was pleased. They all look very pleased. Just got to see the Adj about it. Here, Bill, here that'll muck things up a bit won't it. Well they are mucked up. He'll be over the range in a few minutes. The ministry or shall I put it through Air Force channels? Writing'll take time. Well, yes, it'll be several days at least before we could get a decision. But today's flying, that must be stopped. They mustn't use the range, not now. I'm sorry but I have no power to cancel a flying program. - Then who has? - Well, the commanding officer but I'm afraid he's away. Well who is in charge? Well the squadron commander of course but he's out making the first tests. Then you must stop him! You've got to! Oh please do something. I'm sorry I'd like to but there's really nothing I can do. It'd be too late anyway. He's due over the target now. Hello Tower this is Archer One. I'm making a dummy run now. Get range control to report on it and then relay it through to me. I just want to prove that the line works, over. Roger Archer One. Range control standing by on the phone waiting for your dummy run, over. Archer One to Tower, flying level, angels one two. Making dummy run now. Here we go. Flying Control, he's done his dummy run. Angle correct. Thank-you Range Control. Tower to Archer One. Range control report, dummy run concluded and angle correct. Are you requiring all details of test noted, over? Archer One to Tower, yes better take details. We'll give altitude, time target in sights, time of release, over. - What's happening? - He's climbing to make his first run. Alright, flying level at 12,000. Single pair firing test. Rocket pair A selected. Beginning dive now. 11, 10, pilot wavering, nine, target steady in sights, eight, steady in sights, seven, steady in sights, Hello Tower. Something flew into my windscreen and blanket it out. A dirty big bird or something. Sorry to startle you. I'm canceling run and returning to base, over. - Will he be alright? - Well, I hope so. Tricky landing with a blacked out windscreen. Johnny's a darn good pilot. Funny how one bird can upset an operation. Perhaps as Squadron Leader Parsons is coming we might discuss the whole matter with him? You did say with the CO away he could cancel flying. Alright, but I want to see him land. Come on out, and I'll have a word with him at once. Perdita. If you'd like to wait here, I'll ring briefly so I can get him to come over. Flight, phone. That's a bit nasty sir. That was a bird that was. Yes, half way through the dive. Lucky I wasn't lower. It might've been tricky. See what you can do about it Corporal. I doubt if we'll get her refueled and ready for another solo before land sir. There wouldn't be time anyway. I've got a briefing straight after lunch. You' won't be making a solo test then sir? No, I'll skip it. I can't hold up the section flight. We'll have it ready by then sir. Job for you Buster. Message for you sir. More trouble about the range. There can't be any more holdups. There mustn't. Well the Adjutant would like to see ya sir. He's over at flying control. Alright, I'll see. Looks like he hit a buzzard or something. No buzzards around here. Gull probably. No rockets fired either. That'll please the locals. It'll please Sally. We'll have to tow it into number two hanger. Here you, go and get a riveting gun will ya. Oh and er, Bill, slip over and get a replacement for the windscreen. We'll have to put the entire section in. Right. What do you think? Well the fact that this chap Bookie has given them seem to hold water. It may be just another false alarm of course. Like their other claims. We've only got four weeks as it is. If cancel training and their claim is wrong, we lose half of that. I go ahead and their claim is right, there'll be the devil to pay. Well, officially they should make their objection known to the Ministry of Land Acquisition. Oh hang what's official. What's the right thing? Well, that's your decision. I've already told them as the CO's away, you're the only one who can cancel a flying program. - What do you think? - Well, you're being sent overseas. Alright, let's tell them. I think you know Squadron Leader Parsons. Mr. Parsons, that bird you hit, what was it? I'm sorry, I don't know. It was just a bird. I've discussed this objection of your with the Adjutant. Er, if you give it to me in writing I'll see that it goes to the Air Ministry immediately. But that'll take days! What happens meanwhile? I'm sorry the training must continue. Aren't you exceeding your powers? I'm merely carrying out orders. I'd be exceeding my duty if I cancel this afternoon's training program. Now I must ask you to excuse me. I've got a squadron target practice at three o'clock. Is there nothing more we can do? I'm sorry but we must carry on with our orders. If you'll let me have the objection in writing, I'll see there is no delay in the matter. But this afternoon, three o'clock. That must stand. Very well, I'll draft the letter myself and let you have it later today, thank-you. Sit down. Sorry I'm late fellas but they're still working on my windscreen. Now let's get straight down to it. Time on target 1500, that's in 50 minutes. Take off 14:45, press buttons 14:40. Have you had a time check? - Yes. - Yeah. Right, now we're in two sections. I'm leading red section and Jimmy blue. Red section's on first. Aircraft and formation are on the board. We take off in quick succession to form up immediately. Save it to the end Jimmy, I want to run through the whole works first. Snowy, hand me the range chart. Did you tell the Air Force? They're going ahead, this afternoon at three o'clock. - By three? - That's what they said. Well come on, hurry up and get everyone down to the boatyard. Well, it's too late now anyway. It's never too late for them that's got rebellion in the blood. What's on your mind? I'll tell it when everyone's down there. But now we know the time we can stop 'em yet. Come on! This is all old stuff but listen carefully. Now here are the two targets. Number one, and by the trees number two. Red section in first at thousand yard intervals, beginning dive at 12,000 feet and tracking from 8,000 downwards. Fire one pair between 2,000 and 1,500 and break sharply outwards, repeat outwards, returning to altitude for the next attack. Blue section standby at 10,000, two miles up sun, and watch 'til it's your turn. Now Met says there may be some cloud around but it shouldn't be anything to worry us. So if it ain't legal, where's legal nonsense got us yet? That's what I've said all along. So what is your idea, what is it. I said I could stop 'em if I knew what time they was going didn't I? Three o'clock, that's all we did learn this morning. Well, if there's anyone there, can they? Then who's gonna be there? We are! Soapy and me and Tilney. All of us, the whole village. Surround the place with boats hey. - It's risky. - So was Kett's Rebellion. Do you think we ought? Those that are scare needn't come. The more the better, more chance of being seen. Someone ought to tell Bookie. I'll tell him, I'll tell him! We've got 3/4 of an hour. To the Island of Children, and then we've got 'em. Alright fellas, you all know what you're doing, you've had your dummy runs. That concludes the briefing. - You wanted range control. - Oh yes, hold it a minute. Hello Edwards, how does it look? Everything's sitting pretty here sir. You've had the latest Met gen I suppose. Down here there's some low cloud moving in fairly fast. Thin and broken, low and all clear below that. Anything else we ought to know? No, the range is absolutely clear. I haven't seen a soul all day. Those danger flags have kept the village people off I suppose. - Here, what's all this? - Rebellion. We're off to the Island of Children. But it's mad, it's illegal! - You can't! - I can't help that. Stop! Archer Leader, you're clear to go. Roger. Hello, Flying Control, the last minute check. The place is absolutely deserted. I feel like Robinson Crusoe. Can't stop. Can't stop. Spread out the boats. Come ashore to the targets the rest of you. Hello Tower, all sections airborne, climbing to position as arranged. There seems to be some low cloud but we can fix the range position, over. Hello Archer Leader, last report from range, estimated 3/8ths cloud. Cloud base 3,000. We'll let you know of any reported change, over. Five minutes to go. We can't hear them yet. Come on, come on come on! Over by the targets. Come on! - Come on, come on! - The place is jammed full of people! Get me flying control quickly. - There's no reply sir. - Here, give it to me. The line's dead. Right, spread out a bit! - Well, that's funny sir. - Hmm? I can't get a squeak from the range. Here, give it to me. Hello Control, Control! It's hopeless, come on outside. Well, you can't sir. The aircraft are on their way. We can't just, I'll get them away somehow. Get back all of you, do you wanna be killed? - Who are you? - I'm the controller - of this range. - Well, you're not controlling us, see! Spread out all of you! And when the aircraft dive, wave! You lunatic, it's suicide! Get back all of you! Do you wanna be killed? It's alright, the Air Force wouldn't fire on us! A lot lower than I expected. At 12,000 we'll a circuit for you to drop us down. Then take up your position, over. I don't like the look of them clouds. Do you mean, they might not see us? Aye. Archer Leader to Blue Section. What is your position, over? Hello Archer Leader, I'm sanding by two miles up sun. We'll follow you in, over. Boys are at it are they? Due to make the first run any minute, sir. - Any trouble? - Well, the villagers are now claiming it's church property. Johnny refused to cancel flying so they're putting their claim in writing. What again? Everyone's group will climb the curtains if anything more holds us up. I should've thought these people would've given up the struggle by now. What? Have signals checked it? Have they any idea where the break may be? When was the last contact with range? Hello Tower. Section and angels one, two. Running in towards target now. We'll be starting dive in half a minute, over. We're not signaling now, they're just about to go in. There they are. That cloud's awful low. - I wish I could see them. - Here we go. Look out! Don't fire, don't fire! Red and Blue sections do not fire! Red and Blue sections do not fire! Blue sections do not fire! The target is packed with people. - Have you got that? - Roger. Well. I suppose we might as well go home, hey. I'm bringing all aircraft back to base immediately. Target area's packed with people and boats are anchored all along the river. No rockets discharged, no casualties. Returning now, over. Get the local police on the phone and tell them to come over here immediately. Get me flying control. If these fools want to risk their lives that's their affair but I won't have my men placed in such a position again. - Right sir. - Flying control, what's the latest? When will they be down? Alright, I'll go out and meet them. Fools, what have you done now? We stopped them, that's what we've done. You might've been killed. - You deserve... - Well, we're alive aren't we! Fools! If I find that anyone from this station had a hand in this affair, I'll personally skin 'em alive. Are you alright, Johnny? Yes, sir, I'm okay. Some of the boys are pretty shaken though. Just imagine how they'd feel if they'd killed any of those blasted fools. You better come up to the office and give me all the details. What the devil happened to range control? The line was dead. I've sent a car to collect them and get their story. The police are on their way here too. This'll mean more holdups. Group'll want a report and the press are bound to get hold of it. Oh there'll be an inquiry I imagine. You can't keep a thing like this quiet. Well, the result of the inquiry. Ah, the inquiry. And the Suffolk rebellion that started it. Hey, what's happened to the Air Force? I haven't seen them about for a couple of days. Oh, Fanny had a phone call from young Buster to say they'd all been confined to camp for 48 hours. There's been no flying either. Ah, talk of the devil. - Evening. - Evening Joe. Never seen you here before in uniform sir. Oh well, as a matter of fact... Come have a drink with us. No hard feelings I hope. Well, you're lucky to be alive. But since you ask, come on Jimmy. Air Force, come and have a drink with us. It's strictly against regulations, drinking in uniform, but I'm on my way to group. Has everyone got leave again? - Yes. - Go on Joe, rustle 'em up. Well, what're we drinking to? To a toast, achoo, of human folly. Hello Mr. Parsons, come to say goodbye? How did you know we were leaving? I've got visitors. Well, I reckon we won, hey. We can't be certain of that yet. It'll be at least three months before they can hold a public inquiry. They don't half take their time, hey. And probably another year before the result is known. At least we've got the place 'til then. You might even be back by then. Back? Here what's all this about goodbyes and going away? The squadron is going on leave tomorrow and then overseas. I just came in to say goodbye. Where are you going? Malaya. I believe I told you once, we haven't always as much time as we think. That's why training is always given top priority. Alright, you got your Island of Children. Now we have to move to another range, and someone else will have to wait. Maybe their task is urgent too. There's no end to it is there? End to what? Being always prepared. - Cheers. - Cheers. Maybe by the time you get back we'll know about the Island of Children. At least you've gained a year or so of time on it. You don't gain when you lose something. - Perdita? - Yes. - And now you. - Oh Sally. Don't take any awful risks. I'll probably never been as great a danger as you were. We had to do it, Bill. So did we, Sally. We were both right. Such a little island isn't it. You mean the Island of Children. No, I was thinking of England.
