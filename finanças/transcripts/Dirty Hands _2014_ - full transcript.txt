Come on. Come on. Get in. Go through the swamps, straight ahead. Relax, okay? We're almost there. Move it! Those are the lame dudes you'll be working with today. Come on, move! Bring it. That's 100 kilos. And they'll count them one by one when they get there. Listen. Got it? If we need to dump it in the ocean? If you get in trouble, release the hook and the log will float to the surface. Follow the shore line until Panama. A piece of cake, right? Don't make any stops to visit towns, whores or anything. You never know what could happen. If you get into a guerrilla zone, they'll kill you. They'll kill you, one by one. I've already been to the meeting point. Call when you get there. Come on, gentlemen. Move. We don't want to be late. Move your asses! Quick! Full throttle. Don't want to dance? Come on, man. Stop being an asshole. We have women to spare here. No. I don't like that dance. Besides, it's stupid. Don't be an asshole. Dance. - Come dance with me. - No. Relax, okay? If my being here bothers you I'm sorry, dude You don't want to hear What this chick has to say You'd better run, then 'Cause I'm not going away This is my land It's my turf and I'm here to stay - I'm the Don, so-- - Hey, Don! - The boss wants to see you. - Cool, brother. Thanks. What's up, guys? How are you doing? - Good or what? - Fine. - Shall we? - Let's go. How's my people? - How's it going, Valentín? - All right, dude. What do you think of Los Aldeanos? - They are okay. - Dude, what? Those dudes can sing. They really know how to sing. - Are they locals? - No, those dudes are from Cuba. They are the best Cuban band. Dude, they sing this song called "Hermosa Habana." That song gets to you, you know? They have troubles just like us. You know what I mean? They are really good. You two sing together, right? - Yeah, we rap together. - If you want to be the best, you have to listen to the best music. Not just local music, you should listen to American, Cuban, Brazilian music too. Man, even Japanese music. What's up, guys? Do you hear what I'm saying? I know people who can help you make your own album. If we do well in this smuggling job, can we do it again? Dude, that's the idea. We want you to keep smuggling. Do you hear me? We want you to smuggle. - How often do you do it? - Twice a month, guys. You can trust me. I'll smuggle that shit well. Hey, it's up to you. Look at you, man. Move it. Anvil! You cheated, man. What's up, boss? Go, I have to talk to these men. Go help them. What's up, Don? How are you, bro? - How are you? - I'm hanging in there, dude. I'm hanging in there. - As usual. - I'm happy for you... Guys, this is Hector, my boss. Why did you bring two? I said only one. Why did you bring two? What did I tell you, man? You both already know the way here and you saw me. One of you has to go. Tell me which one! Tell me, who should I kill? Welcome to my house, guys. Have a seat. Clean this. Come. Have a seat. What will you drink, guys? A soda? Some rum? A soda. Hey, what will you have? Relax. Make yourself at home, man. So, listen, man. There's a little problem here, do you hear me? We only need one of you. The other one can do it next time, okay? - What do you say? Who is going? - I'll go. - But you have to give us one of those. - What? Are you crazy, bro? Listen to this asshole. You don't need that. This is easy. You'll be with a man who knows the entire ocean. But tell me, do you know about motors? This is the easiest job ever. You just enjoy the landscape. It's like a paid vacation. Be good, okay? You leave tomorrow. Show some respect to the owner. Walk. Jacobo. How is everything? Look at this Negro. He looks sick, man. Relax. Have a drink. Let's talk business. The past is the past. I think it's time to become friends. Man, black boots suck. You can't even clean them. Drink it. Cheers. The smuggling business is good. We'll have work for you. Can I see my son? Of course you can see your son. And you can come here any time you want. Come on! Up! Go the other way! Make it easy! Kids these days don't know what they are doing, man. Look at him. That kid over there, number 16. He's quite good. In three years, he'll be playing in Barcelona. Make that two. He's been scouted. Back in the day, I was better than him at that age. When have you ever played soccer, dude? Why don't you go to Bogotá, man? I know why. Because there aren't black people there. That place is dark, you know? The only black people in Bogotá are the ones cleaning shit in public restrooms. In Bogotá, black people don't stand a chance. Just one last job and I'm out of Buenaventura. Don Valentín is cool. He said he would help me. He said that if I do good, he will give me more work. I told you. My cousin works for him all the time. He is a good man. I'll do my best to please all those men so I can keep working for them. That way I can forget about that fucking construction job. Hold your horses, babe, let's see how it goes. - Not there. - Tell me, where do you like it? - Stop that. - Come on. Go. If something happens to me, it'll be your fault for leaving me like this. I'll go. Give me your gun. Are you stupid or what? Don't do it, man. - It's okay. - Stop whining, dude. I know what I'm doing. Look at the lefty. You want to learn how to shoot straight? Look. You look through here and here. Focus on the target and... Check the hook. Are you on time? Yes, we are making excellent time. Okay. We'll spend the night at the shore. Stay here. I have to take a leak. I'll be right back. What, asshole? What is it? Go to hell. Shut up. - Show some respect. - Let go of me. I'm not your stupid little brother. Not anymore. Next time you put your hands on me, I'll punch you in the face. Get to work. Soccer is better now than it was before. The young players are faster. The old players can't handle it. The young ones are very good. Shut up, dude. What do you know about soccer? I'm telling the truth. Well, nowadays there aren't any big stars. Look at Maradona. He scored the goal of the century while the others watched. Maradona? That man is a fake. They call him "God's hand." Somebody should tell him it was soccer, not volleyball. That junkie. Look, I do know some big stars. Pelé, Henry, Valderrama and Zico. Stop bluffing. You didn't even see Zico play. Zico was good in his time. He wouldn't stand a chance in this generation. Zico was one of the best, you hear me? It's not all about speed. Vision is important too. Zico had vision. That man knew how to lead that team. Once he had the ball... Let's just say he made magic happen. If you don't believe me, take a look at the '82 World Cup. Zico is one of the best players that has ever existed in this world. Wait a second. Are you saying that Zico was better than King Pelé? - Seriously? - You are blind, man. You can't see the truth. It's always the same story with your people and Pelé. Do you know Zico's nickname? White Pelé. White Pelé, motherfucker. - How old are you? - Nineteen. Nineteen. You never saw Pelé playing, but you still think he is the best. Why? Tell me. Because he was the best. Because he is black? You're a Negro and he's a Negro. That has nothing to do with it. Ask anyone. Everybody thinks Pelé is the best of all time. I think they don't say Zico was the best so as not to upset that Negro. Pelé. Every fucking Negro says the same shit about Pelé. It's always Pelé. You call him the King? He is the king of Negroes. Hey, pass the water. That was nice. Life is good. Go to sleep now. Calm down. Easy. - Look at that! - Let's see what it is. Hey, let's go. The tide is low. What are you doing there? Hey! No! Hurry! Get away from there! Hey, Delio. We are leaving, man. Bro, look at me. Get up, man. Come on, bro. Get in. Wait. The Navy. Relax, man. Be cool. Let me do the talking, okay? - Hello. - Hello. - How's the fishing going? - It's been a bad day. Where are you coming from? Buenaventura. Where are you from? - Where are you heading? - To Chocó to visit my cousin. All clear, sir. Hello. Miguel? He's dead. - Got the torpedo? - Yes. - Got the GPS? - Yes. Carry on. We are leaving. - Don't you get tired of listening to that? - What? Don't you ever get tired of listening to music? Music is the reason people in Buenaventura are sick. They talk about killing, fucking, drugs and all that bullshit. The mind always talks about what the body can't handle. Rap talks about real life, you know? About your life too. Don't you kill? Don't you fuck? I rap about real life. Listen to this. See what you're missing. What are you listening to? I like good music. Grupo Niche, Nemus del Pacífico, Guayacán. With that, I wouldn't be able to sleep. Rap is a form of expression, man. We are artists. "We"? So, you are a rapper. Apparently, everyone in Buenaventura is a rapper. I live in a neighborhood Called the Swamp If you want to see some talent I'll be waiting, man It's a nice place to live But we struggle to survive People in my neighborhood Like to live in peace Live in peace Karma and DJ East, the best rapper duet in Buenaventura. Hey, Mr. Karma, you never told me why are you still in the Swamp. I take care of myself. We live close to each other. I live in the Palace. You live in the Invasion? What happened to your house? Some men came and started growing coke. They keep telling me, "You can come back anytime you want." Motherfuckers. We live close, yet we never see each other. That's true. I've been living there for four years. I have a girlfriend and a son. You have a son? Yes. He's six months old. What's his name? What? - Jacobo. - What? No, stupid. That's his name. It was the first name that came to my mind. And, hey, unfortunately, he got your nose. Well, you are wrong because my nose is nice. Look. Every time I see him, I see that big old nose of yours. What? Don't lie. Your boy must be gorgeous, then. So, that means you are a dad. That's right. Let's get some sleep, bro. We have to get up early tomorrow. Relax. We finish this job tomorrow and that's the end of it, man. Yes? We are at the meeting point. Things are quite complicated here. Stay at 4.5 knots North and 81.7814 West. Don't move until it's dark. So, Marcela and you live in Invasion. Marcela left me. What about Julito? He's gone. How can that be? So, you are alone? Are you really alone? That's bad. Let Puerto Rico know The land of the jibarito Forgive me, New York But this song is not for you To Panama and Venezuela And to all our brothers Let Puerto Rico know The land of the... Jibarito Forgive me, New York But this song is not... For you - To Panama and Venezuela - And to all our brothers Grupo Niche apologizes But it's not our fault Let Puerto Rico know The land of the jibarito Forgive me, New York But this song is not for you To Panama and Venezuela And to all our brothers Grupo Niche apologizes But it's not our fault If in the Pacific coast There are places we love We carry them in our hearts And we compare them to the rest There you'll find love and affection And an atmosphere of passion We carry them in our blood From the smallest to the biggest We share the same skin color And a smile on our faces Dear Buenaventura It's about you that we are talking Look. What's up, guys? - What's up with what? - Hey. Here are the coconuts! - The coconuts are here, my friends. - What coconut? Did you lose something? These are the best coconuts in the entire Pacific Ocean, man. Did you lose something, bro? Cut it out. I'm thirsty. Listen, man. These are the best coconuts in the Pacific Ocean. On days as hot as today, I usually sell these at 1,000 pesos. But today, you can have them for 500. Yeah, they are filled with water, but you can have them for 500. It's cool. It's cool. You want a coconut, bro? It's cool. Relax. It's not like we are smugglers. Jacobito is going to be a great soccer player. He'll be good in any position. No, man. What are you saying? He'll be good at everything. But it's not easy to make it as a forward. If you are short, you have to be very strong. Messi is not even six feet tall. Julito is also going to be a great player. He'll have all the moves. Julito will have Zico's vision and Jacobito, Pelé's talent. I bet Julito is really big. Jacobo. Jacobo? Some of the guys went to the soccer field to play. Julito went with them. Some men showed up that morning. They told them to stay down. Julito, stubborn as always, stood there trying to be the hero. He said no and started running. That's when they shot him. He was the first one who died that day. Those men killed my son. When I got there, I saw my son lying there, man. Like a dog. They shot him in the head like some animal, man. - Jacobo. - What? We are here but we are out of fuel. - Yes? - We are here. Fish. He said we should wait and fish. I'm just saying, dude. I'd be tempted. Fishing all alone out in the sea with no women around, with this beautiful ocean. If you weren't here, I'd be jerking off for sure. No, man. Please, don't, okay? I bet your dick is white from all the jerking off. You are sick, man. - You know who I was thinking about? - Be cool. I don't want to know. Do you remember Lina? Please, tell me you remember Lina. Lina Fernanda Castaño. Yes, sir. That ass. What a piece of ass. How can you not remember her? Of course I remember her. The most beautiful woman in town. I saw her naked once. That's bullshit. When? You don't know me that well. I used to sneak into her house every morning to watch her taking off her clothes. I would also peep though the key hole. I saw her naked. Lina Fernanda Castaño. You have no idea what I'd do to her if she were here right now. You wouldn't know what to do with a woman like her. I wouldn't know what to do? I have a Master's degree in asses... Son of a bitch! Help me! Get over here so I can pull you up. Fuck! The hook! What is it? Fuck! The hook! Where's the hook? Come here. What happened to the hook? That must have happened when you were steering and you want to blame it on me. I always make sure it's there. Well, I fell asleep. I was steering all night while you were lying there like a-- They're going to kill us. You, me and our families, asshole. Hello. The boat will arrive at sunset. We have the afternoon. We have six hours to find that shit. We have to... We have to go back to where we came from, yes. We have to go back and find that shit, man. I'm getting something from a boat ahead of us. Come on. Full throttle! - Come on! - All right! Yeah, come on. Full throttle. Fuck! Ma'am. Do you have some fuel to spare? I'll pay you. - I don't have any. - Where can I buy some? In the next town. A bit farther. Thanks. Be careful with the carts. Where are you heading? - What? - I asked were you were heading. To town to buy some fuel. It's not far. - Is it hot? - No, not at all. Get down. Put it back. Jacobo, look. We found it. It's by the river. Stop here! Against the current now. The soup is almost ready, Nana. - Is it too hot? - No, it's fine. - Be careful with this necklace. - I can't fix it. It's that asshole. Wait, Nana, everything is going to be fine. He's alone. He's just with his grandma. - Where is the fucking torpedo? - I don't know what you are talking about. You don't? - Be cool, man. - Shut up! - He could be telling the truth. - Shut up! Stay out of this. Don't do something stupid. Do you really not know? I'm not wasting my time on this asshole. Pay attention. If you don't give me what's mine, I'll kill your grandmother. Right in front of you. Relax. Be cool, man. Where is it? What the fuck are you doing? You are taking it too far. I'll kill you too, motherfucker. I told you I was the devil. You don't want to talk? Look. - No! - Tell me where it is! I need a kilo. She is very sick. She is very sick. If you tell us where it is, we won't hurt her. I promise. Move. - Relax, man. - Don't tell me to relax. Hello. How far away is the next town? How much is it for the ride there? Get down. Stay there. Don't move, motherfucker. Don't move. Don't look at me. Don't move. Get down. Just a moment, please. Grab that side. Right there. I've never seen them around. I've seen you before. When you were little. We are family. They are my cousins. They are helping me with my grandma. They are good people. Let's go. Quick. They'll find out soon. Hey! Somebody stole my cart! Somebody stole my cart! We are almost there. Come on! Faster! Faster! Come on! Quick, then turn it off. - Where is it? - There. Move. Move it, man. Move. Come on. We are taking your boat. Is that okay, dude? Thanks. Watch him. We don't want him to run away. Help! - Help! - Go! Go! It's him or us! Run! Help! No. Please, don't. Help! Delio, we have to go. We have to go now. Delio, come on. I'm going to Bogotá. There are no black people there. It's all there. That's Miguel's cut. If you want to, you can do this again next week. That's what I'm talking about.
