After tonight, the fucking world changes, and I ain't getting smoked in my sleep. - Hey what's up? It's done. That's good. Son of a bitch fought another battle and came out on top. Always had a good feeling about that kid, first time I met him. I'd seen him around some. His dad was a degenerate fucking doper and his shit caught up with him so ended up locked up. I never really took a good look at the kid till that night. Fifteen and a fucking man already. Never saw a kid hold up like that. Yeah, I can see that. Shit I told him that night come work for me. He wanted more than a job type fucking job. So we kept in touch through the years. He went on and got his M.B.A. He's fuckin' genius. Prodigy. Wasn't long till I realized what he was made for. - and what's that, sir? Getting shit done. My old driver, the dead one. brought me there to his graduation. So he was doing all this fucking song and dance, you know, graduation ceremonies. It took him a while to make his way over to my car. I let him in, he handed me his diploma without a word. I still got that motherfucker. He's a god damned beast like me. But he's smarter. It's why I brought him into this business, to inherit it. Him and Eve make me so fucking proud.

Go to Bojangles after this? Shit! Fuck! [Vincent Voice Over:] There are two fucking important choices in life. Either do, or don't. And I've seen too much of the latter not to be in on the former. And for that, these people here know me pretty fucking well. And the trick to it, isn't the choice you make. But what choice you can live with. These sons of bitches know what I'll do if they screw with me. I mean I've done it time and time again and another time won't fuckin' kill me. It's what I know. Not love, but fear and passion. This passion gave me the strength to do what others wouldn't do. I mean fuck it, it got me what I wanted. But you see the difference, I mean the real difference between me and every other cunt isn't that I don't have regrets. I mean, I got my share. It's that I can live with them. Despite those other cunts. I mean most people I've associated with are either dead or on their way out. Don't matter to me because I wanted something I could call my own apart from the norm.
