As a reminder: After the Chernobyl environmental disaster, my daughters said to me: "Now you have to make a film about the dangerousness of adults." That's why I let 12 children from all over Switzerland disappear in my film Full Moon from 1998. In a letter to their parents they write: "We want earth on earth." The reasons for their demand strike me as more relevant today than ever. The missing children are now 35 years old. I dedicate this director's cut to them. Fredi M. Murer December 2021 Where's Toni? Where's Toni? Emmi, you know what we agreed on. You can count to four. But where's Toni? Emmi, you get on my nerves with your questions. You mustn't disturb me before four o'clock, you know that. Play with Argo if you're bored. Argo, go and get the shoe! And this one, too. And this one as well. You can bring me this one, too. Good dog, Argo, good dog. Emmi, where's Toni? Emmi, have you gone mad? Will you stop that! Will you listen to me? You didn't listen to me, either. Claudio? Would you please give me Toni? What, didn't come to school? Are you lying? I waited for him with the bike. I don't know where he is. He didn't come. I'm not talking rubbish. Yes? I can't connect you. Dr. Escher is abroad. I'm sorry, I can't tell you. Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Escher. Probably this evening, from St. Petersburg, on the last plane. Hello, Max. I'd like to tell you personally, but I want you to know as soon as possible. Toni went to school this morning but didn't get there. Nobody's seen him since. I have a strange feeling. I informed the police. It's Friday evening, half past five. Well, what shall I say... bye. - Also missed... - The next one must be No. 47. Maja Noll, 10 years old, from Zurich-Wollishofen. They must have cleared off together. Ten-year-olds? That's rather young. ...blond hair, brown eyes... Not bad, I wouldn't mind living here. It's quite nice. Yes, this is it. I'll have a word with the mother first. Tony! My field of research is just out here, underwater, a pile village from the early Bronze Age. Is Toni also interested in your underwater archaeology? I should say so! He knows almost more about the lake dwellers than I do. He comes diving with me. We forgot the boathouse. Thank goodness, his goggles and fins are still here. These are mine. But they are a bit too small for me. Just a minute, please. Emmi, didn't Toni tell you anything... that he wanted to go on a world tour or so? He said I wasn't to say anything... otherwise my Argo would disappear, too, for ever. Argo? Is that your dog? And did Toni say that this morning? And if I don't tell anybody at all, will you tell me, then? And what does that mean? That's my secret. Toni! This is the boat in which Toni went to the island this morning. In that boat? And who is that boy there covering his eyes? That's who Toni went to the island with last night, with lots of other children. What did the children do there? That's where they discussed a secret plan. No, you see, Argo's still there. I won't repeat your secret to anybody. But did Toni tell you where the island is? Where? There on the lake. - But I can't see anything. Just water. - You have to close your eyes. That was my husband phoning from Vienna. He thinks I'm hysterical, says I'm to leave it to the police. Unbelievable! Listen, Emmi, nothing will come of the weekend with Papa once more. He has to work on Sunday. He's had a flat in Zurich for 6 months. Toni had difficulties to start with... So did I! You're separated? Why didn't you tell me before? I don't know where to look any more. I'm Toni's teacher. As if the earth had swallowed him up. - Mrs. Gfeller. I've got Toni's satchel. - Claudio, where did you find it? Next to his bike, under the big oak by the lake. His bike's locked. Give me the satchel. Excuse me. I must see Mrs. Escher. Schilter to Botta. The student who comes into the house has found Toni's school bag and bike. Start the usual procedure. Understood. Cordon off the locality, request sea police and dog patrol, over. Vera? Has there been another call about Toni? No, but all you have to do is call, then you'll know. That was the first time I heard Irene's voice. I like her very much. No, Max, not a clue. They searched the wood by the shore with dogs until it got dark. Fortunately not. No, Max, I don't want you to come. What did you say? I don't mind, you can consider me hysterical and a jealous horror. She's asleep in my arms. No, let's hope for it. Bye. Well, Ms. Botta, see you tomorrow in office 308. Good, yes. And sorry for my late call. Yes, thanks. Borgo, turn around! Out! - Xeno, come! - Turn around! Police, can you identify yourself? I'm Josef Sandmeyer, 77, piano tuner. Residence: Greifensee. And what's your name? We ask the questions. What are you doing here at this hour? At night I'm out here and I go to bed when it's daybreak for you. What are you doing with all these dogs? - Were you here yesterday around 8 a.m? - Yes. Did you notice anything special? Yesterday? Yes. Just after seven I saw a small boat land on the pebbles over there and a light-footed person got out. And short before eight two light-footed people got in again... and rowed out onto the lake. A nice picture. Have you got an eye complaint? No, on the contrary, I'm blind from birth. Oh dear. I'm sorry. But still, thank you very much for this very interesting hint. - Don't mention it. - Have a nice day. Mr. Escher, I've already asked your wife, but... did Toni ever mention the name Maja Noll to you? The girl is of the same age and has also been missing since yesterday, from Zurich, however. Maja, no. A former fellow student was called Noll. I don't know if he had any children. Her parents are Iris and Hannes Noll. She is a social educationalist, he is a lecturer in social ethics. They live in Zurich-Wollishofen. - Hannes Noll! - Yes. My family has nothing to do with this Noll. Nothing at all. That was only a routine question. What makes you so angry about this Noll? Calls himself professor of social ethics! He used to be a terrorist, a militant Greenpeace activist. As a future nuclear physicist I was of course so to speak the personification of his foe image. And vice versa? I'm not unforgiving. At that time, yes. - Tweri, have you found anything? - Yes. In '83 he reached the peak of his career and landed on a nuclear reactor with a hang-glider. An endless list of sins, but somehow he always managed to wriggle out of it. Noll comes from a good family. What have you got against him? Nothing. He's just a wolf in sheep's clothing. Why that? Such a kidnapping somehow corresponds exactly with Noll's trademark. No, I want to go to kindergarten. You're a pain in the neck! Come on now! Hurry up! But I want to go to kindergarten, not to Granny's. Don't you cause trouble. Mr. Noll, all you have to do is say where she is. Mr. Noll... Shall we have some coffee? Will you have coffee, too? It's unbelievable. My child has disappeared, and I've been sitting in this hole for 4 hours listening to you telling me old stories and to the most stupid defamation. I'll only talk in presence of my lawyer. Mr. Noll, this is the fifth time you've said that, and I'll answer you for the fifth time: Until all suspicion has been cleared, we unfortunately have to keep you in police custody. Danger of collusion. That is why all contact to the outside is strictly prohibited. I need my medicine. Yes, that's your duty, I know. That's what I pay taxes for. But I forbid you to take any measures without my express approval. I make you personally responsible for that. Yes, talk to him, he can call me back if he wants to. Yes, yes. Goodbye. Hello, Irene. Ah, the police. They should be privatized like the post and railways. You needn't worry, Irene. Your Toni will be back in a few days. Why didn't you tell us right away? Now they might be miles away with the boy. Never mind. The safer they feel, the better it is for Toni. Follies always happen in the heat of the moment. What are you talking about? Do you know what's happened to Toni? What do you mean, whether we know? You're so naive, Irene. It's as clear as daylight. Any moment there'll be a call claiming a ransom. The police have been tapping all our lines since this morning. The one who pays gives orders. I made that clear to the police. We won't take any risks, Irene. I'll pay any amount, whatever they demand, any price - but according to my conditions. - Who's this I hear? - Hello, Irma. My pet. Please don't let her out of your sight. Did I ever let you out of my sight? Let's go to the kitchen. We don't know anything new about Maja. Has something happened to my husband? Don't worry, he's still at the station with us. We should just hurry... Here is the confirmation. A search warrant? Why? - Don't act so hypocritical. - Hypocritical? - You know what we're looking for. - Maya. - Exactly! - What, just now? That's why we should start quickly. How? Wait a moment! You don't want to...? Take that, you're not coming into my house! I have other things to do! Leave me in peace! I don't want shit like that in the house! Hello, Wasser speaking. What's the problem? What? Blast and damn! Who? Him again! No, that's my concern. I'll be there in 3 hours at the latest. What will happen now? Mrs. Noll, I don't want to mince words. Your husband has lost a lot of blood. But if his condition remains stable we'll try to wake him up today. He'll come through, will he? How's it going? The circulation has been stable for 2 to 3 hours. If you need me, I'm on the ward. - My name's Wasser. Hello, Mrs. Noll. - Hello. I'm the head of the criminal police. I'm sorry about what has happened. I'll get to the bottom of this, that's a promise. Here's my card. Call me anytime. Damn it all, I've already spent all Saturday with that green asshole, and now my Sunday's going to be wasted. - Sit down. - I've no time. You don't seem to know that Noll's life's hanging by a thread. If he kicks the bucket, we'll have a perfect scandal. You've got yourself in a fine mess. This is a pure abuse of authority. But this time you won't get off scot-free. And why are you so damn sure that Noll is the victim and not the culprit? His attempted suicide is the best proof. Or has he another motive to take the law into his own hands? Noll has been under medical care for years. Since his daughter disappeared, his condition has deteriorated. You lock him up on suspicion of kidnapping and don't let him contact his doctor. Are you mad? For us that means: Increased alert for security. The criminal police in Zurich keep me informed on the course of the inquiries. It's loaded. The safety catch is on. Just in case. Your gun licence. I don't really feel threatened. No case? Do you know how Noll tried to commit suicide? Slashed his wrist with a fountain pen. He's still in a coma. With a fountain pen? How awful! Why didn't they take it from him? You know the people have too much in their stomachs and not enough in their heads. That's why we have to get his emotions under control. For that we need a topic of high ethical value. Something that has nothing to do with our business. For example... the tragic story with Toni. Ah yes. - Feet in shoulder width, ok? - Yes. First we would spread a rumour: A high cadre's child possibly kidnapped by nuclear opponents. If they then deny it, they'll make the story really public. And we would remain elegantly silent about it. Healthy popular sentiment always takes the side of the victims. That means in this case, Toni's. That would be a stinker for our green friends. Awesome, isn't it? 22.5.98. Now let's see what that gives us. What? Ackerknecht... Eisenmann. This is Toni. This is crazy. Before I tell you, I must remind you that official secrecy is to be applied internally, too. I hope you understand. You can water the flowers afterwards. I stumbled upon it yesterday. It must be kept secret so the search is not jeopardizes. Twerenbold and Botta mustn't know. Tomorrow morning all the investigators must be present here in Zurich, all 12. You must manage that by all means. Here's the address list. "Top priority", otherwise only those from the French and Italian part will turn up. We notice quite an equal distribution among all four linguistic regions. There is no possibility of a coincidence. I am sure that these 12 individual cases are connected. There is no question of individual perpetrators. This means we are dealing with an organized crime. If you know anything, call me. I thank you for your confidence and hope for a good co-operation. Co-operation? We're the linesmen and you're the referee. That's how I see it, too. Take a seat, please. If something has happened to my daughter, please say so immediately. I can't believe it. Why does such a high-ranking policeman come specially from Zurich to Walenstadt? - Why? - I'm waiting for your husband. - May I ask you something first? - I know that question. How can a man be a racist who lives with a woman who looks... ...like her? That's it, isn't it? It doesn't quite fit, does it? I'm worried about my daughter who hasn't accidentally been kidnapped by this goddamn asylum-seeking mafia. - Am I a racist because of that? - There's no proof for your assumptions. What do you mean, no proof? Here: No proof! The swine sell little boys and girls to psychopaths in brothels. Or they carve up children like rabbits and sell their organs. They have a hideout over there by the lake. There they sit comfortably in the sun and study our code of civil law. But I understand, you don't want to dirty your paws. You prefer to confiscate a few children's porns for yourself. I could sue you for insulting an official. I have nothing to lose. I'm prepared to do life for Manuela. I'm sure it wasn't here last night. It dropped from the sky. Please tell me: Is Gabriella an only child? Is this a reproach? You've read the files, haven't you? Excuse my stupid question. But what makes you so angry? - I can't stand these clichés any more. - What? It's a cliché: A mother who goes out to work isn't a good mother. After all, my husband is a senior physician and a father. - Ingeborg, you start to bore Mr. Wasser. - No, no... Because she always has to bring up her theories. Listen: We adore our daughter. She's everything we've got. But we must say that neither my wife nor I are the exemplary parents we should be. - Coffee? - May I see Gabriella's room first? Go ahead. Mrs. Gilardi, didn't you notice anything special, either? She told me lots of things on the phone. What she'd been doing, what she experienced. She was very disappointed because her piano lesson was cancelled. But otherwise she was like she always is when I phone from abroad. I was in London for a few days at a psychology congress. Yes, psychology. Oh, Gabriella knows how to use the computer. Yes, Gabi is a computer addict like all the children at her age. We used to play football, they surf in the Internet. They have more to teach us than we them. May I open a program? If you know how it works. I don't even know how to switch it on. Since he disappeared, my husband's been playing Cyrill's favourite piece non-stop. And Selina, my daughter, hasn't said a word since. - It's terrible. - I understand. We'll take a walk to the lake, maybe she'll talk then. Mr. Grond, have you got enemies? I could name a dozen who'd prefer to see me dead. But so far it's only been dangerous for our cats and dogs. They were poisoned instead of people. It's a tradition up here. Do you suspect anybody? I can't believe in a crime. You don't touch a child. If they want to do me in, they should do me in. Children are sacred, no matter who the father is. Mr. Grond, as a main contractor and a prominent party politician it is known that you aren't at all soft. Are you hiding something out of fear? Some sects and secret societies demand absolute obedience from their members. Mr. Wasser, do you really mean that? Do I make that impression? Or do you want to call my Party or the Rotary Club a sect? Why have you become set on this question? - Are you hiding something from me? - Yes. - What about your wife? - You can ask her yourself. In any case, she puts her mother before God. And what do you put before God? Excuse me, Mr. Wasser, there it is again... his voice. Diego? Diego! Now his voice has gone again. It's always like that. As soon as I reach the place he told me to go to, his voice is gone. He's somewhere here in my head saying, "To the left, straight on, turn right," until I stand before a site where I'm planning to build. - What? Here? - Yes, it's nice, isn't it? Here it is again. Here it is again. Diego. Bastard! Enough. Take care, play with him. - Why always me? - That's enough. Go on! - You know, I can't concentrate. - That stands to reason. I don't understand why the police don't publish any photos. Every square metre in Switzerland is inhabited. Toni can't have disappeared off the face of the earth. He must be somewhere. For the police it's a routine case like numbering shards or hoovering is for us. Botta says that out of 100 runaway children 98 return unharmed... because they forgot their pocket knife or their account card. No, Arina, believe me. This damn uncertainty makes me mad. Good spirit in the glass, what's your name? Sometimes I catch myself praying to some kind of YOU. Me of all people! Then do so, Irene, you know... in such extreme situations sometimes an energy awakes that... that has self-healing powers, like fever. It needn't always be God if our instincts suddenly work by chance. Come, we have to show you something. Irene, now you can ask OMM to give you a word that will help you to find Toni. Omm, give me a word that will help me to find Toni. Irene, a visitor! Hello, Mr. Sandmeyer. I forgot all about it, I have visitors. Don't go to any trouble. I suppose the grand piano is still in the same place. Emmi will accompany you to the music room. - Irene! - These children! This game should be banned. Which game? And now you want to hear what I see? "YES - NO" "S". And at the back in the corner there is someone else seated. He's dressed like Mozart. - Do you want to hear what he's playing? - Yes. Mr. Sandmeyer, would you like some coffee? Yes, please, black, without anything. Thank you, madam. You can bring me some tea, please. Here's the mail. This is Toni's writing. What did you say? Nothing. Toni's alive! Argo, look here! Look! A letter from Toni. No ransom claim? Are you sure? Somebody's playing a game with us. Is it really Toni's writing? But at least it's a sign of life. The scientific service will see if the children's writings are authentic. - Why do you talk about writings? - What, did I say writings? I'm sorry. But I need the original one. Aha. - You've already got his exercise-books. - Yes. My fingerprints will be on it. Something else concerning this letter: The head of the criminal police wants absolute silence so the search is not jeopardized. Silence? How am I supposed to take that? You'd better ask him yourself. Superintendent Wasser will come to see you today. That's for me. No, Emmi. Leave it alone. Hello, Fürst speaking. What can I do for you? Oh, it's you, Max. How do you expect us to feel? Every time the phone rings we hope it's the blackmailer. No. Nothing. Absolute silence. Oskar is terribly disappointed. Yes, Emmi's waiting for you. See you later. Hello, Papa, when are we going to the zoo? Oh, you always have to work! Yes, you promised it to me. This is the whole truth: This morning not only you and your husband got a letter from your missing child, but also Mr. and Mrs. Noll and ten other parents. Their children all disappeared without a trace that Friday morning, like Toni. Quite an unusual story. When the scientific service has proved the authenticity of the 12 handwritings, the other parents and your husband will be informed. You are now subject to the official secret. That's why Mrs. Botta spoke about handwritings. And why have our children been kidnapped? I visited all the other parents personally to find that out. They haven't the slightest thing in common. Except for one. But that's so absurd, I hardly dare mention it. Are they all being divorced? I don't know. No. All the houses are right by the water, like this one. Water. Ever since he left, my husband has been playing Cyril's favourite piece non-stop. Bach? Does Cyril play something so difficult? Cyril is dead. I don't know it. Herr Eisenmann, your son has possibly been kidnapped. At least, there are indications. I can't say more at the moment. Somehow... I just can't believe it. Are you quite sure? The same paper, the same ink. All the handwritings are authentic, without doubt. Another question. Have the stamps been wet with saliva or with water. We'll do anything for you. If it was a tongue, what would you like to know about it? Age, sex, religion? Ethnic affiliation and shoe size. We'll do that. Before we continue, I ask our secretary for a temporary report. I'll sum up briefly: The 12 children's handwritings are authentic. The wording of all the letters is identical in all four national languages. The letter contains a coded message which has yet to by analyzed by specialists. The authors of the letter are most likely to be found in fundamentalistic circles. The letter is in the form of an ultimatum: It contains a) a demand: "We want the earth on earth," b) a time limit: "...when the moon is full again," and c) a threat: "If you don't want this, the earth will continue to turn without us." The time limit is the only definite thing. The children actually did disappear when it was full moon. It's 18 days until the next full moon. - That's it. - Thank you, Mrs. Hauser. Any remarks? I'm probably the only one here who speaks all four national languages. When I read the letters, whether in German, French or even Italian, they strike me as a poor translation from Rhaeto-Romanic. From this I conclude that the perpetrators should be looked for here in the Engadin. To prove that, I would like to read the letter in Rhaeto-Romanic. Here we go... May I have your attention, please. Chera Mamma... I think Mr. Dazzi... Thank you Mr. Dazzi. Thank you very much! We all know quite well where we have to look for the perpetrators. I demand more competence for us officers in charge. Each one of us should be able to muck out the fundamentalists' dens in his own region in an unbureaucratic and efficient way. I'm of the same opinion. I am of the same opinion. In addition I suggest an extensive press briefing. If you give the press an inch in this case they'll take a mile. I'm against this idea, Mr. Dubois. Mr. Wasser... Excuse me... here's the information you asked for. The DNA test revealed that all the stamps were wet with the same saliva. Beyond all doubt. - Male or female? - Male. - Hello, Oscar. - Hi Max. - Daddy. - Emmi! Those cowards were afraid to post their ransom demands. Forget about your ransom. Those guys don't want your millions. They want to see deeds. Didn't you read the letter? There are idealists at work. They want to give Mother Earth back to the plants and animals. We are at the turn of the millennium. The esoterics have high season. To celebrate the millennium, they want to force the nuclear industry to disarm. That's why they didn't kidnap your grandson, but my son. Your job has blinded you to reality. Nobody has to force your nuclear industry to disarm. This makes the liberalization of the electricity prices. I say this to you as an old capitalist and pro-nuclearist. I want to go to the crocodile now! Throwing money in brings good luck. - Yes, isn't it? Here. - We'll do that now. Goodbye guys. Bye, Emmy. Bye. What did Toni write in the letter? Nothing for me? No, nothing for you. It's mean that the animals in the zoo are never allowed out of their cages. How so? The animals belong to the zoo after all. No, the animals belong to themselves. Yes, the wild animals in the jungle. These belong to those who feed them. Then I would belong to Mama. Alright. Children and the wild animals belong to themselves. Is that good? - You should be dead! - No... - Hello mum! - Emmi! You smell like wild animals and french fries. Will you do me a favour? Take off grandma's terrible jacket. Tell me, did you have a nice time? We were very far away, farther than Africa! Farther than Africa? What animals were there? You should have come with me. Yes, indeed. Mom, if dad doesn't come back, then I'll think you're my big sister. A courageous example that impresses me, and I hope it does you, too. I am addressing my grandson's kidnappers. - Look at that. - That's Grandpa. Hello, Grandpa, I can see you. If you have something else in mind than to extort money, then take me as a hostage instead of the child. I'm sorry, but we're not at home today. I am waiting for a sing of life from Toni. The ransom is ready. Maybe the kidnappers don't know German or haven't got a television, or they... they aren't interested in money at all. - Stop consoling me, Elsy. - Stop it, Oskar! If they've harmed Toni... then he was allowed to live but 10 years. And I've only been turning everything into money for 50 years. And that's to be his ruin now. You're tired out, Oskar. No wonder, you didn't sleep a wink all night. That's right, I don't want to sleep. I must do something in my life to prove to Toni that I really love him. You frighten me. I'll call the doctor. I'm not ill. Did you hide my cigars? Ten days ago, twelve children across the country disappeared without a trace. All parents have now received a letter from their child. The content is the same for everyone. It is therefore obvious that the children were kidnapped by an organized gang. You've got a letter from Toni and didn't tell me anything? You also knew that eleven other children have disappeared? May I know why you're keeping all this secret? That is my business. If you take this shit letter serious, you're collaborating with the kidnappers. Also because of that. Are you taking me serious? If I want to be screwed, I could take any other guy. I don't need you for that. Since you've been banging this chick, you've gone mad. I want to live out my youth. What you're doing is pure blackmail. If you want to return to your school boys, go ahead. The earlier the better. The search for the alleged kidnappers is in full swing. Because the search is unsuccessful, the police are under pressure. The raid followed tips from the public. We from Live TV were there. Out with you! Put some pants on! - Bastard! - Can't you walk yourself? - Go away! - Paws off, you pig! Are you crazy?! Come on. Stop resisting. Hello, please send a taxi to Brunngasse 8. At Escher. Not in ten minutes. In two, it's urgent. Yes, thanks. Go away man! Leave me alone! We switch to our reporter Sabet. We're live at police headquarters. How do you, as chief investigator, justify these brutal measures? Politically or religiously motivated groups seem to abuse the children for their ideological purposes. We must therefore act decisively. Is it a sect? That's it from police headquarters. Thanks. For everything. I won't give an interview. My father's appearing on TV has caused enough damage. We're from LiveTV. But we're only doing our job. You soon unmasked us. Congratulations. I understand your aversion to the aggressiveness of the media. I admire your consistent attitude. There ought to be more self-assured women like you. Thank you. But I don't want my private misfortune to be made public. One cheeky question. We've been on the go since early morning. Nothing but frustrations. Would you offer us an espresso? I'm actually sick, but... all right, just a quick one. She's fallen for it. Put your camera down there. Are you alone in this big house? Big? Excuse me. Why big? Yes, alone. That is with my children. My husband moved to town 6 months ago. Now I bring up the children alone, besides my studies. This is the limit! Did your husband leave you because of somebody else? Is that any business of yours? I didn't mean to offend you. It's just a question. Yes, that's it. She's quite a few years younger than you. He didn't leave me. I threw him out and threw his furniture into the lake. Well done! May I see Toni's room? Irene, you really are a silly cow. What's that bullshit you're talking in front of the camera? That's got nothing to do with the goddamn TV viewers. How, took you in? Toni's disappearing has nothing to do with my father's money. How can you... how can you be so naive? That's a clear case of trespassing. Leave that to me. Okay, see you. Hello? Excuse me, it's a bit early. My name is Joschi von Muralt. You were angry about the show with your wife. I'm a legal associate at Live TV and I would like to apologize. Do you have time? My lawyer will contact you. He has already. Therefore I'd like to personally apologize to you for the defamatory practices of our employees. All right, I'm coming down. But it'll take a while. I'll wait for you down here. There. That's all we have about sects. The boundaries to devotional literature, however, are fluid. Please don't get me wrong. I don't give a damn about this esoteric rubbish. But you've read this letter. Who do you think is behind it? I've thought about it. Fundamentalists of the last days, with a tendency to Christianity. They probably want to free our planet from the greatest evil. - Of which? - From us. Sooner or later we will disappear from nature anyway. Where do you get that cynicism from? The boss is coming. It's a matter of intelligence. I'd like to speak to Mr. Escher. Privately. Mr. Escher... remain seated. I am very worried. The company doctor tells me you're suffering from acute stress symptoms. Troubled sleep, sudden sickness, mental instability. Is that so? I can understand that. Also that your work seems secondary to you at the moment. We can't shut down the works. I would like to temporarily exempt you from your work. Can you accept that? The official opening of the season is only in a week's time. You're the only guest up here. They heated the swimming pool specially for you. Apart from Botta, does anyone know where you are? And Irene? Good. You definitely won't appear on TV. I made sure of that. Nobody will know you up here. There isn't one Swiss, not even the manager. You'll see, nature has a healing effect. The worst thing at the beginning is the peace, when you realize nature doesn't need you. Emmi, wait here with Argo. Unbelievable. They're crazy. Come on, Argo, get out now. Come come! - Go inside! - How dare you? Out! What cheek you're allowing yourselves! I count to three, then I let him loose! A cheek and mess! Where is Tony? That was to be expected after your stunt on yesterday's Live TV. So bad? Should I send a patrol car? It'll scare away the crowd. You should go away for the weekend. Visit good friends or so. Excuse me, Ms. Escher, I have a trout there... A beautiful one, yes. I'd be happy to invite you if you feel like coming here. Where is that? At the end of the world. - Good day. - Good day. Is it far to Hotel Maderanertal? Yes, you have to reckon with two, two and a half hours, with that girl's short, stubby legs. - Can't you get lost? - Up here, no. You have to cross the Schachen Bridge. It is well signed. - Thanks very much. - You're welcome. Is the beard real? The beard is real. This is nature. - Thanks very much. - Goodbye, have a nice day. Same to you. I don't care. The main attraction of this house is not the good kitchen, but our tremendously poor television reception. We do receive the Sky Channel, but not one of the Swiss channels. Better no TV at all. - Then we'll stay until tomorrow. What do you think? - Oh yes! As a troubled TV star, you appreciate a TV-free zone. - Well, bon appetit. - Thanks. What does your husband say about your TV appearance? Let's leave that. ...militant activists talking about Mother Earth. As if we had to ask cattle for forgiveness before slaughtering them. Protecting nature is fine. My party isn't against it either. But please not at the expense of the common goods! Deforestation of the rainforests sure is a disaster for a few monkeys and savages, but disasters are always an opportunity and a challenge. Take the Kobe earthquake. - For the Japanese... - You can't put it that way. It unleashed gigantic investments for the Japanese economy. Perverse. The world economy needs such large orders caused by catastrophes, if you want to take responsibility to feed everyone and create jobs. You can't talk like that! Then it would be best for our society, that all children disappear. Stupid bastard! She shouldn't talk crap like that. - Leave me alone! - Are you crazy? Organize a weekend trip once a month. You can't call that "being a father". So you think that there are basically only single mothers. Yes, that's what I mean. So the misery of the world stems from mothers not raising their sons to be men? Typical male logic. How do you explain the phenomenon with women's logic? Our children are growing up in a male emergency area. Do you have children? Two daughters. Gentle Feminists. In their place I'd be more militant. And your mother? Did she raise her son to be a macho? She did her best, yes. - May I ask you something personal? - Yes. What do you as a father think about Toni's letter? - As a father? - Yes. Do you really want to know? I would probably also desperately cling to the hope of a good spirit having guided the children when they wrote the letters. What speaks against it: I've never seen an angel or anything supernatural. Hello, Wasser. No, for once I'm still awake. What's up? So they bought him, too. Did you record the programme? Keep me informed. Good night. That's all right. Fucking phone! Good morning. - 'morning, Mr. Wasser. - 'morning, Mrs. Escher. It's so quiet up here. I slept wonderfully. And I had a crazy dream. - Listen, Emmi. I saw Toni in my dream. - Where did you see him? It was as if it was real. Mrs. Escher. Your dream literally stole my sleep. You described one of the children in your dream very precisely. Can you also describe the other children at the table? Facial expression, hair color, hairstyle, eyes, clothes, etc. So for this you're letting me come to town urgently? Why? You can refuse to testify. All right, as you wish. Toni looked exactly like Toni and wore the same clothes. The black-haired girl, probably the one with the Brazilian mother, had braids with colorful ribbons woven into them, a coral necklace, blue jeans and a reddish t-shirt with a yellow sun. One of the boys was blond and had big blue eyes. And much too large trousers and a gray plush sweater. He spoke French. Another one had a bleached strands in his hair. Am I really supposed to describe all the children? I don't get it. Did Mrs. Botta show you mugshots of the missing children? No, why? Please continue with the description of the children. But Mr. Wasser, I only dreamed it all! Come here. Unbelievable. I can't explain it. And you? Purr, sleep, huh? The case of my life has become my trap. Any idea how to get out? What? I'm not to be superstitious? It's unlucky, isn't it? Change sides? The letter has a good tone, but I don't understand what it means. Maybe one would need something like an absolute musical ear. Apart from you I don't know anyone who has it. Your judgment is important to me. If Toni wrote the letter himself, with his own hand, nobody forced him to do it. Do you know what you're saying? Tony! It's quite obvious. Somebody spent the night up here. - How did this wood get up here? - No idea. Look over there. Those strange boards. We've seen that before. Somebody definitely spent the night up here. Oh, yes? Stop that! We're looking for a missing guest for the Staudamm Hotel. Max Escher. Is that you? Max, what's the matter? What are you doing up here? I've found the missing children. They're hiding up here. No, you're dreaming. In this fucking silence I'd end up seeing ghosts, too. Do you think I brought these boards up here? No, I must tell Botta, as soon as possible. I saw it with my own eyes. They sat up there round the fire, their faces painted white, and they sang. Max, you must come down to earth. In your contract it says expressly that you're to subordinate your personal interests to those of the works. We can't afford an Escher who's gone mad. It's as simple as that. I recognized Toni clearly, I'm sorry, and there were 12. Then tell Tobler, his son has also disappeared. He, too, has visions. Heron from the Wolf Pit. Jaras from the Three Pines. Jakos from Stägefässli. Heike from Tschirrgantblick. Vasco from Wandergut. Hugo vom Rudolfshof. Gentlemen, the woodpile, and especially the one up there, is worse for me than an MCA! This is the worst Sunday of my career as head of security! It wasn't just the security guard who failed, our expensive four-legged friends in particular failed! The most expensive and intelligent pedigree dog is a bad investment for the protection service, if he sees nothing, hears nothing, smells nothing, but falls asleep! I don't believe it! Go on, home with you, children! Get out, get out, hurry up! We paid a nice sum for exclusive rights - A nice sum! Joschi, we'd better go. Go on! - Come on, leave the camera! - No! One... - No, don't shoot. - ...two... No, shit! ...three! I never leave children or animals alone, but now I have to. I'm coming. Yes, it is important. Great, looking forward to seeing you. Mom, Argo is gone. Exactly, Madame Rochat. One moment please. He is not here anymore. I've looked everywhere, he's gone. Toni got him because I wanted to tell you about the secret. - Excuse me, my daughter... - Come on! Stop it! Not you, sorry. My daughter has an urgent problem. I call you back. - Bring Argo back to me! - Until Saturday. Yes, goodbye. - Who was that? - One of the mothers from Zürich. Why doesn't she come here? I can't invite eleven mothers here. Argo, come on, where have you been? Where have you been? This is from Noll's house... And the helicopter pilot took these photos when he fetched Max from the Sidelhorn. The morning he was about to enter. Yes? Did Toni give you the watch, for me? Absolutely nothing. I didn't know what's going on. I opened the door and suddenly he was there. There was no vegetation at all, although water was rushing everywhere. In the middle of this landscape of stones a group of children sat. One of them turned towards me. My heart stood still. It was Gabriella... my daughter. The dark-skinned child who had rowed me to the island waved to me to join them. I spoke to the children in a foreign language, and yet I understood them. I said to them, "You all have the gift of seeing through your hands. If you cultivate this gift until you're grown-up, you'll understand one day that a tree and a person are the same thing." The dreams these women have! Mrs. Gilardi, one question. Could it be that the wood of which these strange huts were built is identical with the wood of "your dream island"? There is no explanation for these phenomena, we have to accept them just like we have accepted so far that the police haven't found any clue leading to the children. There is no explanation for that, either. Dear Mothers, the only advice I can give you is: If you want your children back alive, stop counting on the police, start to act yourselves. Take your children's letters at their word. You have another 6 days' time. Mr. Wasser... you're literally drowning in this soup of irrationalism and superstition. High German, please. To save the children we have to come down to earth, to reality. To us, officers in charge, Mr. Wasser has lost all credibility. For this reason I shall ask police headquarters to suspend you, Mr. Wasser, as head investigator. I demand the immediate termination of this meeting. Dear Mothers, take a walk in this wonderful nature up here. It'll do you more good. Goodbye. That's not what I meant. That strange meeting was a bit like a dream itself. But a wonderful day for me. The poor officers in charge. Especially the lady officer. They won't forget this day so quickly. Can you take defeats just like that? This is the first defeat in my life that makes me happy. Here's to my lady successor. And to your new career as interpreter of dreams. My name's Irene. Anatol. I'm delighted. Here's to you, Irene. Is there a war on out there? Good morning. It's Sunday. We men are doing our duty. What would you like? Tea or coffee? Just water, Wasser. Quite immodest. A bird's-eye view of Central Switzerland is overwhelming, don't you think? Thanks. Three. One, two, three. - One... - Who is it? Miss Piggy. - Hello mum! - Hello, Emmi. You are fine here. - No. - Irene, finally. Mum. Irma, are you letting her lose? - I'm trying hard. - Shall we go to the garden? Yes, good. One, two, three, four. It's your turn. It started completely harmless. First, he swapped the picture of the horse in the library with a fillet of foal. I bought the picture back. And more things like that. In the end he went to the bank and had my accounts blocked, claiming I had Alzheimer's. I have to speak to him. Is he in the house? The doctor advised me, the holding's vice president also urged me... So I gave my signature. It's like a hotel. Interned in the Psychiatric? Why are you saying that only now? You're never home. - Where have you been all weekend? - I can always be reached by phone. I don't even want to know. Thanks to your dear mother, I enjoy a freedom here that otherwise only madmen have. You can't get in here with cash. You have to burn a few thousand. But you can only get out thanks to cash. You behave strange, dad. How are you feeling here? Fine. A bit like Möbius in Dürrenmatt's "The Physicists". - You know that. - Yes. But King Solomon hasn't appeared to me yet. Elsa worries me. She has no sense of humour. Never had any. But since I've "retired" it's a lot more important. When you're together for almost 24 hours. You know what? I long for more freedom and less marriage. That's why I had to burn it. But burning your own money is punishable by law. The paper belongs to the state. I don't even know you like that. If I remember correctly, it was the other way around with humor. You didn't have much to laugh about. You're right. But that was back then, before Toni Escher's visitations. Dr. Prince, may I ask you? The chief physician wants to speak to you and your daughter. It's enough, he shall leave me and my daughter alone, otherwise I'll fire him without notice. Do you see? You can say what you want, nothing has consequences. It's wonderful. Philipp has been on the go for 8 hours and 45 minutes. His strength has diminished greatly, but his aim is in view. Philipp, what do you feel at this big moment? My... life... is... an... error... I'm coming! Com... Philip? They even film someone dying wretchedly. This is going too far. This fucking LiveTV. We'll lodge a complaint for failing to give assistance. We might get through with it. Xaver, I didn't come about that. I've prepared a document. I'll bear the financial consequences. You want to go... without notice? You can't do that. Just because Botta was right for once. Listen. You'll take a plane to Iceland for three weeks' fishing. When you return, the case "Children of the Lake" will be over. Please sign this. We find your complaint about failing to give assistance rather hefty. We've always worked very closely with the police. It's a unique document of a great human tragedy - without any censorship. - I see! I'd have advised the prosecutor to lodge a complaint, but I have nothing to do with the police any more, I'm here privately. I don't understand a thing. What do you want from me? Nothing. Mrs. Escher and I have something to offer you. Next Friday we'll make the programme "Disappeared without a Trace", not you. The parents concerned. At prime time, from eight till nine. From 11 p.m. Till midnight would be more logical, when the ultimatum runs out. Don't you think, Vital? We want to address our children on live TV. You must give us this chance, Mr. Vitali, in return for your disrespect. A brilliant idea. But we have these proceedings. I can't risk anything or I'll lose my licence. - We can't do it. - Sorry, we can't do it. But I must say, it would be a brilliant idea. To refuse would again be failing to give assistance. I'll make a suggestion. If you suffer financial damage because of our live programme, no matter how much, I shall take charge of it. - Mrs. Escher, that could be millions. - I know. Someone's at the door, mom. If I have a number, I'll give it to you. Don't call anymore. Ok, I'll call you tomorrow. Someone's at the door. Max, there's a woman downstairs. Should I open? This is... This is Irene. - Hello? - Hello Max. It's me. Am I disturbing? No, I'll open it for you. Come on up, we're at the top. Can you open the door? I'll be right back. - Hello. - I'm Irene. - I know. I'm Vera. - I know. - Come in. - Thank you. Max won't be long. Nice. I am pleased meeting you. I only knew your voice from the answering machine. I think we can address each other informally. I don't know, did Max tell you. I'm not really living here any more. We have separated. I just popped in quickly. Max? I'm sorry I burst in like this, but I must talk to you. Perhaps you'd like to talk privately. No, Vera, please stay. We've fixed the date. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. You said no, but you must come all the same. I know, the works forbid it, but it concerns our child. And our child is none of their business. It's only the oven. Do you want to eat with us? The moon has never waxed so quickly before. The children don't give us any peace. I wonder if he'll come. It was strange seeing him again after 6 months. You mean Max? The separation from Vera has quite upset him, hasn't it? He hugged me so tightly, I could hardly breathe. I've never seen him so lonely and shaken. - Has he got any help? - I don't think so. - I can't help him, that's for sure. - You can't or don't want to? - Are you jealous? - Yes. If I am to take over this thankless position, I need the same authority as him. - You already have them. - Like that? Also to ban today's live broadcast? For what reason? To prevent nationwide panic and hysteria. Just wondering what the lesser evil is. If panic or hysteria is suspected, a ban can't be enforced legally, nor would it make political sense. Talk shows are legal in our country. We can't afford a ban, given our image. Besides is the broadcast in good hands, with Wasser. Good. Gentlemen, here is the dossier "Holzhüttchen" for my relief. I'm going to spend a nice evening. What did she say? Will grandma sleep with grandpa in the hospital today? No, grandma wants to watch TV with grandpa today. And because your mom is coming home very late today, I'll sleep here. Who knows if suddenly the door will open and Toni will be there. Then someone must be at home. Why isn't dad on TV? - I'm almost sure he'll come. - Then why can't I watch? We'll make our own TV tonight. - Yes, Irma? - Sorry, you should leave soon. - Take care. - Thanks. - Bye, mousy. - Bye, mom. See you soon. Mr. Escher! - What do you expect from this broadcast? - I refuse to comment. - Do you think Toni's still alive? - Please don't touch me. Stop. Nobody's allowed in. Who are you? Listen, my name's Escher, I'm a father. Let me go in... Do you believe in miracles, Mr. Escher? Do you believe in miracles? I only want to photograph. Leave me alone! I'm so moved, I've forgotten what I wanted to say. Come over here. You rascal, when you get home, I'll smack your bottom real hard and then I'll cook you your favourite dish. Like that you'll know what it means, "The earth on earth." To me that means: Boots in the mud, but a pure soul. Come on, Léo, come home quickly, we need you. That's my wife. I want to talk to my son. When you have so many children, one more or less... Oh, Nicolas... Come on, say something. Léo, I really had no time to answer your question. It would take me all my life. The farm is transferred to your mother. And I've exchanged my pillow for a stone. Léo, in this letter is my first attempt to answer your question. It'll be on your pillow at home. You can come and get it when you like. - I hug you. The letter. - Yes. - Stay with us. - I can't. The police! The police failed. That's all. I've come here in sympathy with the other mothers. But... now they all speak tenderly to their children as if they were still alive. You all seem to ignore that at the other end of these cables the murderers of our children are laughing themselves silly. But somebody else is taking us for a ride, too. Fix the cameras on him. He's sitting up there. Vitali, the director of this channel. Calm down, madam. Don't cry. Just like Mrs. Maillard, I'm disappointed by the police. But still, I don't think this is the place to look for the guilty party. Unlike me, Mr. Wasser... never gave up hope of finding our children alive again. I'm coming back to two, careful. I don't know why he believe that. Gabi, if you are really listening to me, I want you to know that I love you very much and miss you terribly. Mama sends her regards. She's working in New York. Bye, Gabi. Mrs. Steiner? Because this channel's signal is too weak, we can't reach our children out there. So I'll say a few words to you, dear parents in the studio and at home. We aren't alone. They are here, the extraterrestrials. It is for a very special mission... I can't stand it any more! You're simply a dreadful mother and I'm a dreadful father. That's why Helena ran away. It's as simple as that. The things you're inventing, Mrs. Steiner, are pure blasphemy, and what television is doing with us parents is absolutely contemptuous of human life. Lord, protect my brothers and sisters from superstition and television. I played this game for four weeks. What we parents do here is only a disturbance of the peace of the dead. And I just feel disgust for that. Hannes, please. We parents have just one thing in common. We should have been forbidden to bring children into the world. Leave me alone, it's none of your business! I'm ashamed my name's Noll. I make a fool of myself when they see me on TV. - Max, stay. - I'm not staying, I'm leaving. Luisa, Angela, move. Come on. - Come on. - I'm the best dad. But I don't want to talk to my son anymore. The devil may take him. Emilio has become a terrorist. Every day he attacks me with his gang of children. They tie me up, put me in a hole in the street, bury me up to my neck. Cars pass me to the right and to the left until I faint. And when I wake up again, I'm lying in my workshop. All that, since he disappeared. Say something, you too! Emilio, you rascal. Don't take your sisters father away. Leave us alone. Emilio, stay on your island. It's much nicer without you. - Well done. - Bye, Emilio! Hannes... For the first time since we know each other, we agree. You're right. We're disturbing the eternal peace of our children. But you know, I can't feel disgust for it. Losing one's own child is worse than dying oneself. Still, there is something far worse than losing my child. The ultimatum in that letter prompted me to do things... She should go. Stop playing. Away. Irene, stop that damn tinkling. She still plays the piano. Unbelievable, damn it. Wasser shall remove the stupid cow from the piano, or we'll loose spectators. Joschi, do something, we need action, no matter what. - No matter what? - No matter. Well then. Excuse me. An announcement to all parents in the studio. People are excited. The phones are running hot. We have to cancel. What has been said is not enough to fulfill the ultimatum. Please remember that this is about your kids. Won't you really not say anything to Toni? Crap! Why is she annoying? I don't know. I like the music very much. She shall stop playing and join us in front of the cameras. - Chill out. - She spoils everything. Relax. Patience. Let her play until she drops dead, the hysteric! It's all pointless anyway. Nothing has happened. It's useless. Our children are dead! Adieu! Adieu! Now please don't panic. The ultimatum doesn't expire until midnight. Anything can still happen. Also nothing can happen. At least we know that. His left ear. Fuck, I'll become superstitious. That's them, the children who disappeared. Where's that picture from? I've no idea either. It must have developed in the camera. Where is that? Such stones can be found anywhere. The picture's going away. Can't you keep it? No, it's fading out by itself. Shit. The poor devils downstairs haven't even seen their children alive. - If it's on the VTR, I can replay it on the monitor. - No, wait. We'll let them stew a little longer. - Better for our viewers. - Yes, sir. What's he doing? Who is this child? Where's Wasser got to? Wasser? Mr. Wasser? Emmi? Emmi? Emmi? During this night of a full moon 12 times 12 children disappeared without a trace
