There comes a time when time itself is ready for a change. Yes. And that time has come in Montgomery. - I got the right to sit here! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Gonna need that seat. Need that seat. Go on, move back to the colored section. Move. - No. I am sitting in no man's land. It's not white. It's not colored. Anybody can sit here. - By my discretion, and I am telling you to move. I got to enforce the segregation laws. It's my duty. A white person wants this seat. She's the one. - You go on. You do what you got to do. She's the one. She's the one. She's the one. - Come on, baby. - Mr. Parks, we have a real chance here to challenge the bus segregation law. - Your wife is smart. She's educated. - You and Mrs. Parks are so well-respected in the community. Why, she's been the secretary of the Montgomery NAACP for the past ten years. - She'd be most impressive to a white jury. - We've been down this road before, and Rosa is the perfect plaintiff. - Raymond, you have struggled with us all these years. Now here's a chance for some good to finally come of it all. - Ain't no good gonna come out of this situation. Now, you mark my words. - Please excuse us, just for a moment. Please excuse us. Raymond, I'm asking you to support me. - You're asking, or is your mind made up? - Both things. - If they ever find out we using state property... - I know. - To run off these leaflets... - We will both be fired. This is our best opportunity to start a boycott, and we're gonna do it. - You discussed this with Mr. Nixon? - Well, not in as many words. - Then we don't even know for sure if there is gonna be a bus boycott on Monday. - Oh, now, there will be a boycott. You can count on that. - Coretta, honey, give me that baby so you can eat. - Are you sure, Juanita? - See, the problem is, brother, you've been working a little too hard. - Come here, you're so precious. - It's a sermon. It's not some doctoral dissertation. Let me demonstrate this for you. What you do, you get up in front of the pulpit, you get a nice look around, see all the people, fill your lungs with a whole mess of air, turn yourself heavenward and... and let that Spirit fill you, and then... - And whatever come flyin' out, that's what you say! - No, no, no, not at my church, not at Dexter Baptist. Folks over there don't go in for a whole lot of hootin' and hollerin'. Folks at Dexter Baptist are kind of fancy. Now, at Ralph's church... - They're downright noisy and rude sometimes. You can't get through half of your sermon without them causing a ruckus. - That fellow who shines shoes over at the barbershop is a member of your church, I think, Ralph. He said, "Reverend King, you just should've heard." "Reverend Abernathy last Sunday. "He just preached his you-know-what off. He... he was just... oh, just amazing out there." I said, "Well, what did Reverend Abernathy say?" And he said, "I don't recall what he said, but, brother, we laughed." What about the ministers? - Oh, Brother Ed, you know our ministers. They're well-fed, comfortable men with good shoes. Ain't one of them ever even been on a bus. Boycott, sir. - We got two days to tell every Negro in Montgomery to stay off of the buses. One of them's a Sunday. I don't see how we can do that without the ministers. - Well... hey, hey, young man. Now, take this home here. Nobody rides the buses Monday. - Got that? - Bus boycott on Monday. We can't succeed unless we have their support. - Hello, E.D. Well, that's very interesting. Boycotts work, Coretta. It worked in Baton Rouge, and Rosa Parks' trial is on Monday. People want to call attention to it. - Now, why are they having the meeting at your church? - E.D. asked. He thought it'd be neutral ground. - Neutral ground? - And we have a nicer meeting room. - Martin, you're a new pastor and a new father. And we agreed that you wouldn't take on too many responsibilities. - But as a pastor, this is part of what I do. It's just a meeting. - Where were we? Where were we? We were talking about... - I thought we came here to talk about boycotts. - We only have two days to get everyone... - So what I think we ought to... I'd like to make a motion, all right? The motion is denied. - I didn't make the motion yet. - Well, you were fixin' to. - See, that's what happen. - All right. - Welcome to Montgomery, brother. - I'd like to make a motion that we elect ourselves a board. - Get our... - Denied. - But, now, Reverend, I mean, point of order here. - Denied. - Oh, come on, now. - Sister Robinson, I know how to run a boycott. - He sure does. He's about to start one right now. Folks gonna boycott the boycott. I have a question. How are folks supposed to get to work? Oh, good Lord, this is no time for questions, man. This is a time for action. Well, that's... that's a legitimate question. That's a legitimate question. - I just want to say, we gonna need a leader eventually, and since I have the largest congregation here... - We're not ready for nothing like that. That's why I say I nominate my church... - I'd like to leave too, brother, but it's my church. - Brothers and sisters, brother... can... can we simplify... brothers and sisters, please, can I get your attention for a minute? Now, look, can we just simply agree for a one-day boycott of the buses? Just one day just to see what happens, okay? - Martin. Martin, here it comes. - It's empty. - It's empty. - It's empty, not a soul. - Good morning, Reverend King, Mrs. King! - Good morning. - A very good morning. - Good day for walkin'. Yes, yes. Sweetheart, you might want to go on inside and get dressed. - They gave me this and said Negroes are supposed to stay off the bus. - "If you work, "take a cab or walk, "but please, children and grown-ups, don't get on a bus at all on Monday." - What? - We got a ambush. - Quiet. We got an ambush going. - Based on the evidence presented here this morning, I find you, Rosa Parks, guilty of violating the state segregation statute, and I hereby fine you $10, plus $4 court cost. Your Honor, Mrs. Parks will refuse to pay the fine and hereby notices her appeal. Very well. I'm setting her appeal bond at $100. Pay the clerk. - Folks just gonna have to get smart and join the Klan. Order! Order. Order! Now, there's a motion on the floor to suspend the boycott. - Now, now, it's too soon to quit, now. It's too soon to quit. Now, we just getting started. - That's right. - That's right. - Now, I tell you what we need to do. We need to have a little bit more faith in our people and ourselves. - That's right. Order! Order! We... Now, now, we talkin' about whether or not to end the boycott. Now, that's putting the cart before the horse. What we need to be talkin' about is electing us a leader to represent us; Then we can go on... - He's had his eyes on that seat for a while. - You think? - Somebody to negotiate with the city and present our demands. I like him, though. - Old union man. - Christ, Lewis, I don't care. I got something to say! - You don't have the floor. - Now... - Rufus Lewis, he's a... what you might say a man of the classes. - Now, you ministers have been living off these washwomen for the last 100 years and ain't done nothing for 'em. - These are men of the masses. Let's tell the truth. Let's tell the truth. Let's tell the truth! It's our women who've been carrying the torch. It's our women who've been getting arrested while y'all hide behind their skirts like a bunch of damn cowards! Brother Nixon, Brother Nixon, Brother Nixon. Brother Nixon, I'm not a coward, and I don't want anybody calling me a coward, but I agree with you. The time has come to stop hiding. Now, Mrs. Parks didn't hide this morning before that judge, and we should act openly. Now, as for the question of whether or not to suspend the boycott, well, it seems to me that ought to be left up to the folks who attend that meeting tonight. After all, they're the ones who gonna be doing that walking. - While I respect Mr. Nixon's years of service to the struggle, I feel we need a minister to unite our entire community. I think he ought to be, a young man, a strong man. 'Cause we know this job is gonna take a lot of energy. Amen, that's right. - Therefore, I nominate, as president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. May I have a second on my nomination? - Yeah, I second that nomination. Why, thank you, Reverend Abernathy. You ain't see that one comin', did you? No, Ralph, not at all. - You the perfect choice. You been in Montgomery, what, a year? That ain't nearly long enough to make any real enemies. - So you don't think they think I'm the best man for the job? - No, of course they do. 'Cause you fail, ain't they ass in the ringer, is it? It's yours. Who are you, anyway? Just some young hotshot preacher from Atlanta with a big old divinity degree from some fancy Northern university. You're just an outsider, brother, with a powerful daddy. They'll send you home and be back to business as usual. You think so? - Well, thank you, Ralph. - You're very welcome. You worried about leading this thing? - No. I'm worried about telling this woman. - And what did you say? - I said yes. - You said yes? - I said yes. I didn't ask for it. I just made a few remarks to clarify a situation, and before I knew it... - You were trying to bite off a little piece, and you wound up with the whole pie. - That's more or less what happened. - Let's have dinner. No. No time. I have to give this speech in an hour, and you know it usually takes me two days for my sermons. Now I've only got... good Lord. - You'll think of something. You always do. - Now, brothers and sisters, today I want you to put on the whole armor of God. The whole armor of God! Yes! - Against the wrong done against you. - Yes! - This is Dr. King. He's president of the Montgomery Improvement Association. This is Dr. King, yeah. Let him through here. Let him through. Let him through here. - Dr. King, this is the day we have waited for. It's now all up to you. - That hold us in high places. - Yes! - That's right. - And now I introduce to you the president of the newly founded Montgomery Improvement Association, Reverend King. Good evening. Good evening. First, I would like to thank, Brother Fields for sharing his pulpit this evening, and I'd like to thank you all for coming out. You didn't have to do that. But, I know you know that we are here this evening for serious business. We are here in a general sense because, first and foremost, we're American citizens. And we are determined to apply our citizenship to the fullness of its meaning. Right. - But we're here in a specific sense because of the bus situation in Montgomery. Right. Yes. - Now, just the other day, one of the finest citizens in Montgomery... not one of the finest Negro citizens, but one of the finest citizens in Montgomery... was taken from a bus and carried to jail and arrested because she refused to get up and give her seat to a white person. Right. Yes. - And, you know, my friends, there comes a time when people get tired of being trampled by the iron feet of oppression. Yes. - There comes a time, my friends, when people get tired of being thrown across the abyss of humiliation, where they experience the bleakness of nagging despair. There comes a time when people get tired of being pushed out of the glittering sunlight of life's July and left standing amidst the piercing chill of an alpine November. We're here... we're here because we're tired now. Yes. - And we're not wrong in what we're doing. If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong. If we are wrong, Jesus of Nazareth was merely a utopian dreamer and never came down to Earth. If we are wrong, justice is a lie. And we are determined to work together here in Montgomery, to work and to fight until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream! - Ain't nothing wrong with wanting what's right. People around here been wanting what's right all along. - I have here a resolution drafted by attorney Fred Gray for your consideration. And it reads, "Be it resolved that the members "of the Montgomery Improvement Association "will continue the boycott "indefinitely until such time as a fair and just agreement is reached." Now, all those in favor, please signify by standing up. God be praised. - Our Negroes did not stay off the buses by choice. We have proof that Negro goon squads are intimidating coloreds that would otherwise go right on ridin'. I intend to make sure that law and order are maintained, and coloreds that want to go on riding our buses will not be constrained by outside agitators or unlawful elements. - Come on now, come on. - Denied! - We... we... we got people out here who've been... who've been walking for three days, and we can't even get ourselves together to make up a list of demands. - Look, now, we should ask for the deal they got down in Mobile. There's a precedent for it. - First come, first serve seating. - The city council would have to give us that at least. Write this down now. Negroes from back to front, white folks from front to back. - Plus courtesy and respect for the Negro passengers from the drivers. When hell freeze over. - Pardon me, reverends. - Can we agree? - Now, we need to add that we want Negro bus drivers to service Negro routes. - Robinson, they're never gonna agree to that. - Well, we can ask. There's no harm in asking. - If we can't agree amongst ourselves, we gonna waste this opportunity. - They have Negro bus drivers in other cities. - Miss Robinson, you know this is Montgomery, and they are never gonna grant us that demand. - Maybe that's why we should ask for it then. - So they can reject it. - Reverend King. - Look, now, we've emptied their buses for three days. Not a single Negro has broken the boycott. So they know they have to accept some changes, but now, at the same time... They have to save face. So we offer them an unreasonable provision so they can reject it. - It's not unreasonable. - It is to them, understand? - It's just, we have to be willing to give up something. - Give up something? We hardly ask them for anything in the first place. - It's a foothold until we can appeal Mrs. Parks' conviction. - Martin. Excuse me. - Could you please not do that? - Oh, Fred, come on. - Please. Oh, Fred... - Don't ever call this house again. - Who was that? - Nobody. - Well, what did he say? - Nothing I care to repeat. They're just words, Coretta. I've heard them before, and so have you. - Martin, this isn't Atlanta. This is Montgomery. And you do not take those words lightly around here. - This will all be over soon. The mayor convened a special meeting tomorrow with the city council. He'll compromise. They have to. Let me respond to your demand. Part one, first come, first serve seating. Now, we at the Montgomery city line are subject to the law of the state of Alabama, which, as we all know, requires segregation of the races. Look. If I may? The Alabama segregation statute states, "City authorities may require segregation," not "must." - Point two, courtesy and respect from the drivers. Now, as far as we know, our drivers are hard-working, courteous. - Drivers are abusive. They physically throw Negro women off of the buses for sitting in an empty white section. - That is gossip. - I've seen it with my own eyes. The buses stop at every corner in the white neighborhoods and every other corner in the colored neighborhoods. - Well, I won't say there isn't room for improvement. Point three, hiring Negro drivers. We won't tell the bus company who to hire, and we certainly won't stand for first come, first serve system. - They've done it in Mobile. Even if we wanted to, we can't. That would require the abolition of segregation. - Which is a law. Is that what you're asking for? - And other cities throughout the South? - You're not answering our question, Mr. King. Are you and your people calling for the abolition of the segregation laws? - No, what we're arguing for is a more humane system. I've got something to say. Most of y'all know most of my life I've been fighting to kill Jim Crow, whether it's through the union or the NAACP, and I'ma tell you one thing: The NAACP will never support what we doing down here. - I do not agree. - Reverend King, the NAACP will never support an organization that's only asking for a more humane system, never! - Now, obviously, I have a great deal of respect for the NAACP, but this is the Montgomery Improvement Association, and the Montgomery Improvement Association has done more in four days for Negroes in this city than the NAACP has done in ten years. Now, I don't mean to be harsh in this, E.D., but, we need to move beyond this now. This is a... this is a... We share the same goals. We have the same aspirations. We just have different ways of going about it. That's all. - The chicken's almost ready. - There's a minimum fare ordinance. Taxis must charge a minimum of 45¢. - That's bullshit! How am I supposed to see? Peoples can't pay 45¢ for no taxi. - People can't pay 45¢ for a taxi. The drivers were charging a dime, same as the buses. - Which is why they want to raise the minimum fare. - But if the drivers charge less than 45¢, they liable to lose their license and they livelihood. - I hope this don't make Miss King jealous, Reverend. - People aren't gonna give up their cars. - Yes, they will. - They're too important to 'em. - It worked in Baton Rouge. The taxis there weren't allowed to lower their fares either. Carpools kept the boycott alive. - That's all well and good, but ain't too many car owners in my flock. - Well, I tell you what, Ralph. You keep 'em walking, I'll get us some cars. - Now, I'm hearing stories, inspiring stories. We have Mother Pollard here, 70-year-old woman, walking to and fro to work and back home 12 miles every day with a cane, unbent. Now, I feel an unstoppable conviction right now. And I know you feel it too. - So we gon' keep on walking. - Yes! - We gon' keep on walking. We'll walk to work every morning, and we'll walk back home every night. We'll wear a groove in the footpath of our cities. Wear a groove in the pavement until they see the depths of our conviction. We are not walking. We are marching. "And he said unto them, 'Which of you shall "'have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight "'and say unto him, "Friend, lend me three loaves, "'" for a friend of mine in his journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him. "'" Many in this congregation are very fortunate in their material possessions. Material things can be very nice. Many of us have fancy cars, Cadillac cars, and that's all right. But now God is calling on us to use these things to a greater purpose than simply to drive along the highway on a Sunday afternoon or cruise through the city at ten miles an hour to impress the neighbors. Right. - We on the committee have decided on a system to ease our burden. Morning, Mr. Sands. His car broke down. We're asking you, if you have a car, to share it. We're not asking for any outside help in this. We gonna do this ourselves. And we are going to pool our monies from all the churches to share the costs of maintaining the automobile and the cost of gasoline and such. And here's the... here's the good news now. We gonna take up a second collection today. Amen. - And I'll tell you something else. If a couple of farmhands get mud on his precious upholstery, old Dr. Johnson's gonna have a heart attack on the spot. - Now, you be careful, there. - You really think that people will just give up their cars? - Well, I've been told I have certain powers of persuasion. - Who told you that? - My beautiful wife. It didn't last in Baton Rouge. - What? - Boycott. Carpool ended in two weeks. We're guessing the bus company losing about 30,000 Negro fares every day. We subtract some for the folks who walk. Some just stay home. It's about 20,000 people, 20,000 rides a day, that's what we need. Now, with the number of cars we have volunteered, that works out to be about 130 rides a day, every single car. - Every car? - Every car. All right. All you riding out near Madison Street, you gonna ride with Dr. Johnson here. Come on, get in. Everybody go in here nicely, please. - Now, now, you all be careful, please. - Let's go. Everybody, everybody get in. - Please. - Dr. Johnson, you still co-ride, sir? We sure appreciate what you're doing for the cause, sir. No, sir. It's taken us all by surprise. I... I will bear that in mind. Yes, sir. Good night. That was Mr. Milton. From the Dexter board? - Yeah. Reminding me that I'm still the pastor of a church. - And did he also remind you that the last pastor was fired for his radical views? - Not in so many words. But it was very much implied. - You found five? God bless you. - Now, you got to be there at 6:00 p.m. sharp, now. 6:00 p.m. sharp. - Oh, Lord. Okay. All right. I'll get back to you. Got some trouble at the Day Street lot. Vandals done slashed some tires. - They asked us to watch over these here vehicles after some of the tires got slashed. Said we could even sleep in 'em if we want to, long as that don't happen to them. We got to do our part too, you understand? - And then you raised the taxi fares by 45¢. - Cars been vandalized all over town. - Sorry I'm late. - Who is this? Luther Ingalls, secretary of White Citizens. - Is that who I think it is? - Guess he left his robe at home. Mr. Mayor, we were not informed that, Mr. Ingalls was a member of your committee. - I don't think it's our job to inform you, Mr. King. - Well, what is our purpose if certain members have come with preconceived ideas? - Reverend King, I came here prepared to vote in favor of Negro bus drivers. I resent very deeply your statement that we as white people have come here with certain preconceived ideas. I most certainly did not. Nor did I. - Well, I apologize to those of you who have come with more open minds, but I would also like to state for the record that we of the MIA strongly protest the presence of the White Citizens' Council at this meeting. - You're here representing the Negroes. No difference me representing my people. - Don't compare our two organizations. - Why not? - The White Citizens' Council is openly racist. - That is your opinion, Reverend King. Now, I suggest you exercise the same tolerance for a different opinion. - I don't think it's a question of my tolerance. - Well, it seems you've got a real problem with other people expressing their opinions, don't you, Mr. King? This man, this man here speaks for you all? - All right, let me make one thing very clear. Let there be no mistake that Reverend King is the voice of every Negro in this room, but he's also the voice of 50,000 Negroes in Montgomery. - I walked right into that. - Amen. - Now, see, they think they're slick. They're not negotiating on good faith, and they think we foolish enough not to know the difference. - Brother, this is a siege. This is a battle to see who's gonna give in first. They just wore you down. - I guess you're right. - Soon as you concede even one point to the Negroes, you... you open the floodgates. They're like children, W.A. You got to be firm with 'em. - We're doing the right thing just waiting 'em out. - Well, boycott'll be over today. Negroes will never keep on walking. They do not have the stomach for it. - You can smell that rain. - Ain't a cloud in the sky. Good evening. In the year 1619, the first Negro slaves landed in ships on the shores of this nation. Nearly 400 years later, the Negro in America still is not free. Yeah, that's right. No, Miss Stone and her daughters have been waiting for 45 minutes. You need to send a car over there to Jackson Street right now. - I can't guarantee your car won't get a little bit muddy. - All right. - Well, it is raining. Well, we will clean your car for you. But we need it right now. Yet the substance of America is expressed in the sublime words, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men..." - Everybody. We need everyone we can get. So we can count on you, then? Thank you. Thank you so much. - Hey, baby. Yes? No, the boycott's not suspended. Just a little rain. - A little rain? It's a typhoon. - Yeah. All right. Where you going? - Well, we need drivers. - It held, in spite of the rain. - Jesus. Numbers about the same as yesterday. Nobody's riding the buses. The boycott held. - Hello? Martin? Hello? Who is this? It is time for the white community to stop providing taxi service to their Negro maids and cooks. They're only prolonging the boycott. - The only reason they're helping is so they don't have to do they own laundry. - If you really want to hit 'em where they live, make the cooks and the maids go on strike. - Martin, phone call. Think that they can force the white people in this community to submit to their... Thank you, Rufus. - Hello? Hello, hello, Mr. Rowan. Oh, of course. I admire your work. - They think that it's funny that whites who oppose the boycott will act as chauffeurs to the very Negroes that are boycotting. Well, no, that's... that's a false rumor. No, I'm quite sure. That's definitely a lie. No member of the MIA met with the city. Thank you. That was Carl Rowan. Lead story in tomorrow's paper says the boycott's over. - Wait, wait, who said that? No, no, no! Well, according to the story, some ministers from the Montgomery Improvement Association came to terms with the city council. - People read something like that, it could break the boycott. - Well, they can't just say it's over. - Well, they called it a negotiated settlement. - Negotiated by who? We got us a Judas in our midst. - We got 30-some-odd hours to get the word out before the first bus Monday morning. - Everybody don't go to church on Sunday. All right, watch yourself. - Now, how do you know about these places? - You hear things, word gets out, you know? - Hey, Rev, where you at, man? - Hey, Bubba. - Everybody, please remember to stay off the buses, okay? - Hey, Rev, you want to shoot some stick? - So I'll see you in church tomorrow, right, boy? - Damn, you some shooter, Rev. - Y'all gonna play again? - Nah, that's all right. I think my best pool shooting days' behind me, but I appreciate you taking it easy on me. - Wasn't going easy on you. Guess maybe you had some divine help. - Maybe so. I think by the time some of these folks leave out of here tonight, the boycott may be over. - It's time for church. - That King fella, he's a... he's a troublemaker, if you want my opinion. - Don't believe what you read and only half of what you hear. - Who you think it was? - Well, I'm afraid somebody from our board is talking to the city behind our back. - You're kidding me. We got our Judas. - We didn't know. We were summoned by the mayor. They said it was an insurance matter. - Well, so then you never volunteered a settlement on behalf of the MIA? - No, sir. They made like it was something that already been settled, asked us to sign it. - Well, Reverend, it's vital you make the truth public. - I think it would be to your best interest to do so. - Yes, sir. I could see how that would be. - Well, all right. Good evening, now. - Good evening. - You take care. God bless. - Yes, sir. - Now, if we expose this story, we're calling the most powerful men in Montgomery liars. - If the shoe fits, wear it. - But you know these white folks won't see it that way. Bad enough they cut a deal with a bunch of Negroes, then the whole thing falls through anyway. - That's not our problem. - No, it is our problem. Makes them look weak. In order to look strong now, they got to strike back. - Negroes can get where they're going from the back of the bus. - Sam here sits up front with me all the time. Am I lying, Sam? - The White Citizens' Council just got three brand-new members. Imagine that. - Imagine that. - We believed we had an agreement, but the Negro leaders have betrayed us. The Negro radicals think that they can force the white people in this community to submit to their demands. They don't really care about a better bus service for their people. What they are after is the destruction of our social fabric, our way of life. - And we will. - We'll show them crackers. - You are not gonna believe this. Ten traffic tickets, seven of them for speeding. Let 'em walk till the end of time. - Miss Robinson likes to get where she going. - These three here are for going too slow, and that's just in the last two days. They are ticketing everybody who's riding the boycotts. And believe me, they're not cheap. And let them know in Washington, D.C., that we got something going on down here. Now, this can only end badly for all of us. This goes to the heart of our... - MIA? Yes. Oh, yes, you can sign up for a ride. Women, our children... - Well, just leave us your name, and I'll let you know about it. Just... will somebody please pick up the other phone? - Hello? - We're asking you to pay the fine yourself. - Not at this time. We can't. Well, we're figuring out a system to reimburse people. - These tickets are gonna send their insurance premiums through the roof as a provision in the law that allows a state to take action against drivers who are deemed to be hazardous. And too many traffic tickets and... - They gonna confiscate cars. - They could confiscate their cars. - Tell all my friends that Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was my own personal driver. You tell 'em, sister. - Be careful now. - Oh, I see 'em. - Oh, shit. Pardon me, Reverend. - That's quite all right, sister. I share your sentiment. Can I help you, Officer? - Step out of the car. Just him. Martin King. - I've done something wrong? - You were doin' 30 miles an hour in a 25 mile speed zone. - Then write me a ticket. - Shut up. Get up against the car. - He didn't do anything! - What are you doing? - I'm arresting you. You get back in the car! Give me your hands. - Oh, I hope he don't hurt him. - Look, take me with you. He didn't do anything! - You back away! Step away from my car! - Find Coretta. Find my wife and let her know what happened. Yes, Reverend. You see, within the belly of that first slave ship, you didn't have to worry about whether or not you were sitting in the proper section. You didn't have to worry about getting up to give your seat to a white person. You were loaded into the belly of that ship on a first come, first to serve basis. And then a Negro who dared to reject the circumstances under which he suffered, well, that Negro was a problem. - They took him out of his car, and he didn't do nothing wrong! This your first time? Never been here before? Well, no, never before. You see that hook there? Where? You know what that's for. 40 days, 40 days. 40 days, 40 days. And he went up, and he looked over. But, see, you have not yielded to the possibility of the inevitable. That's not for you. That's not for you yet. - This is a property bond. - Only way to make bail's with cash. - This is an accepted form of bail payment throughout the entire state of Alabama, sir. - Not this time of night. - Well, this is an acceptable way... - Take a look at this. - Reverend Martin, this is Harry Phillips. - Evening, Brother Phillips. - Evening, Reverend King. - He's gonna be your driver. - What do I need with a chauffeur? - Look, we can't have you driving anymore. It just ain't worth the risk. - Well, let's go on home. - Yes? Yes? Do not threaten my family. Lord... I'm here taking a stand for what I believe is right. But now I'm afraid. People are looking at me for leadership. But I'm at the end of my power. If we are wrong... I don't think I can do it anymore. If we are wrong, Jesus of Nazareth... Help me, Lord. Was merely a utopian dreamer and never came down to Earth. Help. If we are wrong, justice is a lie. And we are determined to work here in Montgomery, to work and to fight until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream, and when the history books are written, somebody will have to say, "There lived a race of people, "a black people, fleecy locks and black complexion, "who had the moral courage to stand up for their rights, "and thereby they injected a new meaning into the veins of history and civilization." And we are going to do that here in Montgomery. God grant that we will do it before it's too late. - I have today instructed the police department to break up congregations of Negroes that are loitering in white residential districts. The Bible's very clear about the separation of the races. Animals in the woods don't mix. The fish in the rivers don't mix. I don't care what the Bible says or what the Bible doesn't say. This will only lead to a mongrelization of the races. Furthermore, many, local businessmen have promised me they're gonna lay off Negro workers who are being used by outside agitators from the NAACP as instruments in this boycott. - Ain't no good gonna come out of this. People getting all riled up. - Well, I'm sorry it happened. But we still urgently need your car. No, you're not expected to pay for it. We have a fund that covers it. Just send your repair bill to our treasurer, Mr. E.D. Nixon. - Repair bill? Fine. How much money you got in your pocketbook, Miss Robinson? Reverend. - How long has that police car been sitting out there? - I don't know. Long enough, I suppose. Tell me something. Is your landlord a white man? - Listen, everybody. We moving out of here right now. - What? - Grab everything that you can carry. Get everything out of here. - What's going on, Reverend Abernathy? - The police are out there, and if they evict us, they get to keep everything in here. - They've got no reason. - They will find a reason. They always find reasons. Where we moving to? Anywhere, as long as it's owned by a Negro. - Go, go, go, go! - Let's go, come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry. - Good day, officers. - It's supporting an illegal boycott. - What do you expect me to do? She has a limp, poor thing. She's lame. She can't walk to work. - Well, what she does is her problem. Now, every time I see you driving her, I'm gonna give you a ticket. - My white lady always be asking me about the boycott, but I don't tell her nothing. Better she don't know. But I will tell you this... - Joanna, we have things to do. - Yes. - The city isn't offering anything more than the same old segregation with increased bus fares. Now, we've walked for months, and I say we keep on walking until our city fathers give us what we're asking for. - The latest proposal by the city now is just ludicrous. - I agree with E.D. I agree with E.D. - Ladies and gentlemen, now, we've been at this for 56 days now. And I think the boycott has succeeded - beyond our wildest... - Succeeded? - I do believe it is time for us to be reasonable. - Reasonable for what? - What is reasonable? - Now, let Reverend Banyon finish his point, please! - Now, let me tell you what is reasonable. If they give us two out of three of our demands, I think we ought to take that. - We'd be at the same place as we were before. - Hold on, now. Hold on, now. Look, it seems to me that were we tonight to tell the people that it's time for them to get back on the buses, we would be ostracized, completely laughed at. - Yes, yes. - Exactly right. - Look, they have had the courage to continue walking. We should have the courage to hold the line. - Hold the line. - Continue, continue, continue, continue, continue. - Here we are trying to lead a movement we can't ever seem to catch up to. Is there some way we can bypass the state courts? Not in Rosa's case, but we could file a separate suit at the federal level and go after segregation on a constitutional ground. - We've been waiting for an opportunity like that. The success of the boycott might just give us the leverage we need to pull it off. - If we go federal, we gonna bring down a lot more heat on ourselves, a whole lot. You can't deny that. If we're asking the federal court to overrule segregation, we gonna need some additional plaintiffs to strengthen our case, and certain folks gonna have to put themselves at risk. - So Attorney Gray is drafting a lawsuit demanding that the city segregation laws be declared null and void. - On the grounds that it violates the 14th Amendment. - And which one was that, brother? - The right to equal protection under the law. The suit will be filed this afternoon. - Are you saying we going to the Supreme Court or something? - No, no, no. - Reverend King... - Federal court? - No, it's a separate matter. - Now, you gonna sabotage our negotiations with the city. - The city already sabotaged the negotiations themselves by not being willing to negotiate. I mean, they didn't come to the table in good faith. - Now, that's a declaration of war. You gonna give them reason to kill us. - Well, look, Reverend Banyon, from the beginning, the only thing we have asked for is a modified system of segregation, and they already want to kill us. So it seems to me they leave us with two choices. Either we give in, or we just go in over their heads and rid ourselves of segregation altogether. Reverend King, you walking out on a very dangerous limb, and you asking us to go with you. - At this point, our only plaintiffs are women. However, we would like to include some of our men as part of the lawsuit, and at least one minister. A minister has great symbolic value in the community. Now, the Reverends King and Abernathy wouldn't be good choices because they are too much in the limelight. - My... my grievances are not personal. - That's right. They're on behalf of my parishioners. I agree with that. I agree with that. - Will not one of you volunteer? We gonna have to make this work with the plaintiffs we have. If we keep the boycott running, the court's gonna have a hard time avoiding us. - Let's hope. - The Negroes are trying to make this a federal case, but we're not gonna let that happen. We don't want Washington politicians telling us how to run our business and how to live our lives. We have rights too. This boycott is illegal. Now, the Negroes can either accept our final offer or suffer the consequences. - You see, in the belly of those slave ships, it didn't matter whether you sat in the right section or not. You see, you didn't have to worry about getting up to give your seat to a white person. You were loaded into the belly of that slave ship on a first come, first to serve basis. Yeah. - And any Negro who dared question the circumstance under which he suffered, well, now that Negro was a problem. - There comes a time when time itself is ready for a change. Yes. - And that time has come in Montgomery. Our opponents... and I hate to think of our government officers as opponents, but that's what they are... Yes. Yeah. - They have tried all sorts of things to break us. But we still hold steadfast, resolute. And still, we don't advocate violence. We don't have to. Yes. - The Lord is with us. - Yes. - And we are a chain. We are linked together indivisible. I cannot be what I ought to be unless you are what you ought to be. Amen. Right. - We are a chain. - Now, we have good news in Montgomery right now. Now, how do we protect our feet? We have all kinds of shoes from all kinds of folks from all over the country. Yes. - Shoes to replace the shoes that has been worn down by us walking, shoes to help keep us all walking. - Yes. - All right. - But we got something else also. I have here a check from our brothers and sisters in Mobile, Alabama, for $500.43. They sent a letter with it, I guess to keep us encouraged. They said, "Please accept this check "for $500.43 for your cause and our cause. "We here in Mobile, Alabama, support your fight. The 43¢ is to let you know that some more is coming." This new "get tough" policy... - Yeah? - This ain't gon' stop us. We all know the state of Alabama's motto. Heart of Dixie. Heart of Dixie? Well, I say let's keep on walking until Dixie has a heart. Amen. - Brothers and sisters, what do we do? Fight on. - We fight on. And no matter what the other side does, it's one thing that they cannot do, and that is force us back on them buses. Amen. - What is it? - Your house has been bombed, Martin. - Coretta, Yolanda? - We don't know yet. - No, it ain't all over. It's just started. - We ain't goin' nowhere. - Reverend King, I can assure you that this type of activity will not be tolerated. My boys will look into this. Want to know what you're gonna do about... - Coretta? This ain't right. - You all right? - I'm all right. - Yoki? - She's fine. She's in the back. We're both fine. - They ain't goin'. We are gonna have a riot on our hands. - I promise you a full investigation. We're offering $500 for information leading to the arrest of the bomber. I understand your concerns, but there's nothing else to be done. It's time for y'all to go on back to your home. - This is our home. - You go home! - That's right. You know, everybody know what we're fighting for is right. And we're gonna win, 'cause y'all white folk, y'all don't scare us no longer, and you can't kill all of us. - Yeah! - I... I want to... I thank you all for showing your support. Everybody's all right. If you have weapons, please take them home. We must not meet violence with retaliatory violence. We must love our white brothers, love our... Love our enemies. This is what we must live by. We must meet their hate with our love. And God is with us. - Well, show us Coretta. - Yeah. - Show us Coretta. - You hit somebody with that stick, and we all gonna die out here tonight, Jack. That's right! That's right! - Hell, I know it ain't right to attack a man's family. I know they're angry. Let him go! Let him go! - I got a job to do. - Let's go. All right, I want that car out of here. We just want to know if she's all right. That's right. - She's all right. - All right. Amen. - All right. Go on home now. - When do we get to fight back? Brother King. Brother King, there are people out there, they want to take matters into their own hands, fight back, show 'em we're not afraid. If the whites bring guns, then we bring guns. - We won't win a battle with guns. They've got more guns. They'll get tired of beating us when they see it won't break us. - Damn it, they don't seem to be getting tired. Seems like they're getting stronger than ever. Seems... seems they like it. - Brother Phillips, we won't stoop to their level. We believe in the Bible. - An eye for an eye, boss. That's in there too. - I'm right down the hall if you need anything. - Thank you, Juanita. - You're welcome. Bye-bye. Hi. Mommy? - Martin, I don't pretend to understand why you've been chosen. I really don't. But you have. And you are the right man. - But that crowd out there, that... that hatred can't be contained. I'm beginning to question whether... It just runs too deep. If you or the baby had been hurt, there would've been bloodshed. I want you to take Yolanda and leave Montgomery. - Martin... - Go to Atlanta and stay with my parents... - Martin. - Until this is resolved. - We are family. - I will not have the blood of my family on my hand. - Don't let them intimidate you. - They bombed the house. I think they already have. I got it. Anybody got a hammer? - Reverend King. - Hello, Coretta. Looks like you're doing a little redecorating. - You could call it that. It's good to see you. - Good to see you too and safe. You've done important work here, son. There's nobody prouder of what you've done here than I am. But there's no reason you can't run this boycott from Atlanta. You push for too much here in Montgomery, you'll lose everything... your position, your reputation. - Daddy, I won't leave. - Martin, they bombed your home. You are in peril. Your family is in peril. This city is set to explode. If you're not careful, there's gonna be a race war. - I can't walk away. I won't. I've started something here, and I intend to finish it. - Coretta, talk some sense into my son. - Baby, what do you want to do? - I'm staying here. - Then so am I. - My name is Bayard Rustin, R-U-S-T-I-N. I believe you have a room reserved for me. Well, put your John Hancock down there and give me three nights in advance, and we'll be in business. - Tell me, how far a walk is it to the home of Reverend King? Well, I don't know what y'all, do up there in, New York City, but you don't want to be walking alone down here at night, especially with this, bus business going on. - And here I thought all black people walked in Montgomery. - Not at night. - Oh... I'll take my chances. - But who are you? - It's Bayard Rustin. - What are you doing here? Why'd you come all the way down here from New York City? - It's a business trip. - You here to stir up something with that Negro boycott? - Well, I do intend to avoid the buses. - What kind of business you do at night? - I'm a journalist. I am working for "Le Figaro" and the "Manchester Guardian." Those are European journals or newspapers. Is there anything else? - What do you want? - I'm here to see Dr. King. - Need to go on home. - My home is a long way from here, and I don't really care to return to it at the moment since I just left it to come to Montgomery to see Dr. King. - Reverend King's not seeing any visitors. Now go on. - Nelson, who is it? - Nobody, ma'am. Somebody just leaving. He can come back in the morning. - Good evening, Mrs. King. Bayard Rustin. - Bayard Rustin. - Excuse me. How are you? - I heard you speak on nonviolence when I was a student at Antioch College. And I will never forget it, because you said something about history that has stayed with me. - Is that so? What did I say? - That history wasn't an accident, that history is a choice. - And why did that make such an impression? - Because it means that we can do something about our lives and we're not stuck with the way things are. So now you're down South. Aren't you a long way from home? - No, no, I'm from Marion. That's not too far from here. Didn't like our Northern customs? - Actually, I did. Quite a bit. - Well, if Bayard Rustin is here, then I guess we've arrived. - Excuse me. Dr. King. I wouldn't miss a moment that's gonna change our country forever. - Yes, yes. So a policeman says to him, says, "Well, can you describe these turtles?" And... and the snail says, "No, sir, I can't. It all happened so fast." Well, see, that's how we feel. Here we are, 77 days into a 1-day boycott. - You've managed to sow the seeds of Gandhi in the soil of the South. - Well, it's not just about Gandhi. It's also about the teachings of Jesus Christ. - Mass action and black social gospel, it's a new form of protest. I mean, it's... it's... it's Negro. It's jazz. - Well, whatever it is, it's taken us all by surprise. - Might just take the whole country by surprise. That's why I'm here. Reverend King, I'm gonna be blunt. You're straying from the principles of nonviolence. - In what way? - You're the leader of a nonviolent movement, and yet you have guns in your home and these armed guards outside. - Let me ask you something, Mr. Rustin. Would you risk your family for a tactic? - Nonviolence is not a tactic. - Would you risk your family? - Nonviolence is an ideology; It's a movement. - I have an obligation to protect my family... - A way of life, a religion. - And defend my home. - Well, the guns don't make me feel any safer. - Look, the movement is in its very early stages. And I hope with all my heart that, it remains peaceful, but... - Peaceful change is healing. - There is a very definite possibility of violence. Oh, hey, Reverend. I didn't know you were... - After tonight, I want you to find a safe place to put that. - But, boss... School officials later suspended Autherine Lucy for her own safety after she and her NAACP escorts were surrounded by angry white students. Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson, speaking to a Negro audience, suggested that only gradual means would satisfactorily settle the school's crisis and other problems affecting equal rights for all Americans. More on that story later. And now the weather... - One Negro girl admitted into a college. That's about as gradual as you can get, I think. - They forgot the part where they throw eggs at her. Well, now you see. It's not just about Montgomery anymore. And it's sure as hell not just about seats on the bus. - Bayard Rustin, ladies and gentlemen. - It happens whenever an oppressed group finds its voice. The white man... Some white men are terrified that if the Negro ever attains power, he will act without pity to revenge the past. - Damn right. - We have to show them they have nothing to fear. - The bus company's hurting. They're on the verge of bankruptcy and are now willing to meet our demands, but the city won't let 'em. - We forgive everything. We have to bring the message of nonviolent resistance to the rest of the South. Everything we've learned here, we have to teach the nation. It's your responsibility. - There's also a rumor. The city might bring indictments. - On what charge? - They dug up some old Alabama antiboycott law. We know the people here. We know they'll walk forever if they have to. - You have got to stop thinking about this as just a bus boycott. It's not! And you cannot win this fight unless there are similar protests all over the South and similar protests all over the nation. It is in your own self-interest, your own. - Have you ever run a bus boycott before? - Not buses, no. - Well, then why are you lecturing these people? - The same principles are at work. - What makes you think they need outside advice? - And who might you be, sir? - Emory Jackson, editor of "Birmingham World." - Well, welcome, brother. - I just want to talk to you about your affiliations. - Well... That was a long time ago... Mr. Jackson. - You all right, E.D.? - Whoever did this, I want to hurt. I want to make the bastards pay. - I understand that. - Reverend King, I ain't like you. I am not like you. I am not a nonviolent person by nature. Now, they've attacked my home, and I want to strike back! I don't know if I can do this. We march and sing and plot and plan and so they can blow up our homes. They blowed up your home too. - Y'all just gonna sit there. You see how they be? - Brother Nixon, Hebrews 10:39 reads, "But we are not of those that shrink back "unto destruction, "but of those who have faith to the preservation of the spirit." I believe that. I'm sorry, E.D. - You know, I got no doubt that man is a leader. I just don't know where he's leading us. We are Christian. If you must stone them, stone them with forgiveness. If you must stone them, - stone them with love. - Amen. - Through these powers, we will discover to our wayward brothers the error of their ways. This is and will ever be a nonviolent movement. - Yeah. - All right. Take care, Ed. Folks up at Fisk want me to come up there and speak. - I'm not surprised. But I can't just, leave here and go up to Nashville. - Martin, it's time. You have to get the message out. If we don't go national, you're going to lose locally. - Now, Coretta, it's another thing entirely for you and Yoki to stay here alone while I'm in Nashville. - So we go to Atlanta, and then what? Many of the Negroes who joined the protest did not expect it to last this long. When asked why, they usually gave one of three answers: "I didn't expect Negroes to stick to it." "I never thought Negroes had the nerve." Or, "I thought the pressure from the white folks would kill it before it got started." Our nonviolent protest in Montgomery is demonstrating to the Negro that many of the stereotypes he has held about himself and other Negroes are not valid. Something is happening to the Negro. He's come to feel that he is somebody. - Got rope, got trees. - These indictments brought by the grand jury should not come as any surprise. We are committed to segregation, both by custom and by law, and we intend to maintain it and to protect our way of life! - They got arrest warrants for everybody on the committee, all our organizers, everyone in this room, 115 of us. It's the largest mass indictment in Alabama history. - They're trying to chop the head off the boycott. So what's our response? Well, we don't really have one yet. And Reverend King's up in Nashville. - How long it's gonna be till they start arresting us? - Soon as the deputies get the warrants, so maybe tomorrow? - Probably is, what I'd expect. - Well, I would prefer not to be arrested at the college. Don't want my students seeing that. All right, I tell you what, brother. You figure out a way to keep us all out of jail, we'll find a way to get you some salvation. Amen. - Yeah, I'm on my way now. But I'm gonna stop in Atlanta... - Hi, Reverend King. To, kiss Coretta and the baby, and then I'll be there tomorrow afternoon. Well, that seems to me that's just a scare tactic, Rev. Yeah, it's the same old thing. Well, you... you do that. You do that. You keep it together. I'll see you tomorrow, hear? Make no mistake about it. The only reason that they're doing it is to try and separate us from Martin. That's what this whole thing is about. - Reverend Abernathy makes a good point. But there's a larger issue here. What is a jail? It's just a building. Bricks and steel. That's all it is. You're the ones who give it power. You've got to lose your fear of jail. - I just want you to consider the consequences of returning to Montgomery. The police there are targeting you. I have that on good account. And you can't lead a boycott from the inside of jail. - You can't lead a boycott hiding out in another state either. - Young lady, there is a larger picture to look at. - Yes, there is, and I'm surprised that you're not seeing it. I'm leaving tomorrow. - They will arrest you. They're arresting everybody. - What are we supposed to do, just go... go turn ourselves in? - What happens to the boycott? - If we turn ourselves in, we're admitting guilt as if we're criminals. - You got that backwards, Reverend. It's the criminal who hides. I ain't got nothing to hide. I ain't no criminal. I ain't afraid of nobody's jail. - You have a wife, a daughter. You ought to be thinking about them. - That's exactly who I am thinking about. - At least tell your wife to stay here with us. - No, no, I can't do that. I'm... I need her. Now, listen, Martin, this is serious. There's a rumor that they're about to arrest. Bayard Rustin for lying about who he is. And I got this from Emory Jackson, who got it from some white guy over at the paper. - Well, they've been looking for an outside agitator. - And now they got one. - And, brother, this could ruin us. They... they... they can turn the whole movement into some Communist plot. - Some things have come up that we need to discuss. - I know. It... You know, I used to think that the Christian ethic of love was only confined to individual relationships. - It's what we are. It's what we breathe. - Yes, yes. - We need to be going. - Those things they say about you... - There's nothing they can say about me that isn't true. I'm an ex-Communist, ex-con. I'm a Negro. I'm a bastard. I'm a homosexual. And I don't have a proper job. I'm a man of my times. But the times don't know it yet. It's a gift, Martin, plain and simple. - What, spiriting you away in the middle of the night? - No, returning their violence with nonviolence. You mark my words, tomorrow, a spotlight will shine down on Montgomery, one that will galvanize this country. - You'll be safer in here. They're looking for you still. - Think I'd be better off in the back of the bus. - Thank you, Bayard. - Reverend, it's my pleasure. - Well, like you said, it's not just about buses anymore. As I look at it, I have committed three sins. The first sin I have committed is being born a Negro. The second sin I have committed, along with all of us, is to object to the twin battering rams of segregation and oppression. The third and most basic sin which all of us have committed is having the moral courage to stand up and express our profound weariness with this oppression. - You're looking for me. It is one of the great glories of America that we have the right to protest. - I believe you're looking for me. - This is not a war between the Negro and the white. This is a conflict between justice and injustice. You see, most people see nonviolence as a cowardly or weak thing. It is neither cowardly nor weak. It is perhaps one of the bravest forms of confrontation known to man. We are using moral and spiritual force. This is all we have. We are using the weapon of love. - The Supreme Court decision on segregation is now law. There is a motion on the floor to end the 13-month-old boycott of public transportation in Montgomery. All those in favor, let it be known by... By standing on your feet. - You comin', brother? - No. You all go on ahead.
