Warning If you have symptoms such as dry eye, headache, urge to bite, doubt your life and feel guilty about the mistakes you made, please close your eyes. A wrong movie makes you suffer for only 90 minutes. A wrong government makes you suffer for four years. This place symbolizes the public opinion. It's the palace of democracy. It's where I go to work. This is what I see every day at work. I'm Hsiung Ying-ying, a Member of Parliament. Everyone knows it's chaotic in the parliament. MPs fight and splash water at each other. But this is just the daily routine. The most ridiculous drama is about to begin. I could never expect… I fought so hard to get into the parliament and now I just want to get out alive. What prompted me to stand as an MP was to protect my home. My home was built on the shore. But superpower St. Arian intends to build a chemical plant on the same stretch. They say the plant is contaminated with rabies virus which turns people into idiots. But the corrupt MPs say it's for our economy. The President says it's for our diplomatic relations. They all say it's politics. But I just know that we might become idiots. To stop the idiotic MPs turning us into idiots, I decide to be an MP. (Six months until the zombie crisis happens) But I never thought I would need an idiot to deal with those idiotic MPs. (Wang You-wei, Security Guard aka Mr. Nose Bleeding) Everyone, please calm down. Please, stop pushing! Everyone, please stop pushing! They're coming out! Ms. Hsiung, don't be so unreasonable. Mr. Li, as long as I'm an MP, I'll never allow them to build the plant. (Oppose the plant vs Support the plant) (Hsiung Ying-ying aka Spice MP) (Li Kuo-chung aka Gangster MP) Stop pushing! Get off! Wanna make your name? Ms. Hsiung, I'm sorry. Sorry for soiling your clothes. I didn't mean it. Ms. Hsiung, I'm sorry. Excuse me, mister. He's just doing his job. Don't make trouble for him. I'm doing my job too! I come to film you today! How do you feel when your home is demolished for the plant? What did you say? Say it again! Ms. Hsiung, please don't be angry. It's okay. I ask you how you feel when you become homeless! Are you listening or not? Please behave yourself. I'm just doing my job. Listen. Did your dad teach you how to behave yourself? I'd pin you on the wall if I were your dad.　-What did you say? Ms. Hsiung, please calm down. Don't be angry. Get off! How are you feeling? I suspect that Ms. Hsiung uses drugs. I suspect that Ms. Hsiung uses drugs. I thinks it's LSD. Ask her to do a drug test. Ms. Hsiung seems to have problems controlling her emotions. She may have violent tendencies too. Ms. Hsiung, please calm down.　-Let go of me! Please calm down.　-Let go of me! Mr. Wang, you acted heroically to stop Ms. Hsiung. You're hailed as the journalists' protector. You have a soft spot for journalists? Actually, I was going to stop her, but the journalist… Stop poking me, okay? Stop filming! Get lost! If she has a moral sense, she'll resign! Right? After the violent incident, Ms. Hsiung resigns. Who will be elected then? We'll get the answer after the by-election. Congratulations, Mr. Li! So easy for you to kick Hsiung Ying-ying out. Don't mention it! All thanks to our great journalist. Come on, let's drink a toast to our victory! Cheers! Cheers! Mr. Li, who do you support in the by-election? The violent attack on the journalist causes the fall of an MP but results in a rising star. Security guard Wang, who fought against an MP and protected a journalist, shoots to fame overnight. Many people encourage him to stand for the by-election. I've got someone in mind. The Internet is inundated with promotional pictures as Wang's popularity soars amid the netizens. As Wang's popularity soars amid the netizens. If he does stand for election, he might be the dark horse in the by-election. He might be the dark horse in the by-election. Whao. What brought you here? Actually, you're the only reason I work here. Maybe the love I've been waiting for… Did you set me up? (Pig's sound) (Hsiung Ying-ying is dismissed) Who? Why on earth did you wrestle with me? You did it for the St. Arian project, right? Ms. Hsiung do you… No… I'm no longer an MP. It's cool to wrestle with me, eh? You want to be famous at my expense, eh? Ms. Hsiung, you started the fight. What on earth is this? Something wrong with you? Yes. I've a bleeding disorder. Inhaling this makes my nose better. I'm not here to talk about your illness. It's your fault that I was forced to resign. You owe me a seat in the parliament. Owe you what? I want you to win the seat back for me. Win what? Don't you understand what I'm saying? You make becoming an MP sound easier than choosing what to eat for dinner. Yes, choosing what to eat is harder. Ms. Hsiung, please stop kidding me. I've got a lot of things to do. I got up so early to get the newspaper without having breakfast and came all the way here. You think I'm kidding you? I really want to call the security guard. But since I'm the security guard… I warn you, if you don't calm down... I'll have to ask you to leave. I'm such an idiot, am I not? I came here to ask a guard to stand for election. Well… You're Wang You-wei, right? I remember you. What?　-I helped you once when you were bullied. Nose bleeding guy, here you are! Have it.　-Wanna fight back? Where are you going? Where?　-Where? Back then I acted like an idiot. I didn't know how to make your understand my feelings. Who asked you to help me?! But now, finally you needs me… I remember it. I feel that you owe me a favor. Even if I owe you a favor… Win the seat back for me. Sign here. I was never elected even as class leader, let alone an MP. I know you're inexperienced. But I'll help you. I'll be your assistant. You're my puppet. If you need a puppet, you can find… I mean someone you can trust. I don't have anyone I can trust. Surely you've got friends? I've no friends either. If you don't lose your temper so easily, maybe I can… Do I look like I come here to make friends? As long as I can stop the project, I'll support even a watermelon if it works. Sign it or not? Just one word. You either sign or say no to me. You'll sign it, right? (Wang You-wei) Hello everyone, I'm Hsiung Ying-ying. He's No. 1 by-election candidate Wang You-wei. He's young and ambitious. Just as his name indicates. Please vote for him! Vote for No. 1 Wang You-wei! Vote for Wang You-wei! Vote for No. 1 Wang You-wei! Excuse me, who are you? Come with me if you want to help Hsiung Ying-ying. Wang You-wei Come and greet everyone! Wang You-wei, I warn you. You must repeat exactly what I say to you. You hear me? Speak! Yes. Sonny, listen to me. You wouldn't be elected without my help. So you'll have to do me a favor in return. Understand? Support the plant!　-Abolish the plant You collude with him? Mr. Wang, you're the chair of the committee. Come over if you've the guts! How dare you talk about environmental protection! Wang, no matter what he says, don't listen to him. You said you'd help me. Didn't you? I support the plant. I know many people suspect that the new rabies virus comes from the toxic waste of the chemical plant in St. Arian. We're negotiating with the St. Arian government. The toxic waste will be strictly regulated. The President has started the diplomatic procedure. So I believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Support the plant! Yeah Support the plant! Don't hit me! Listen to my explanation, please. What's this? Stand for the presidential election? My resignation letter. Stamp it. Please listen to my explanation! I did it for our own good. If the project is approved, we'll get Li Kuo-chung's support. Then we'll be super powerful and influential. I'm thinking… You just want to be Li's pawn. I've always been your pawn, haven't I? So you've learned how to be an MP, eh? I don't want to be a pawn of yours. I want to be someone who can help you. I'm the MP. You're my assistant. You have to trust me. I know what I'm doing. You don't know what you're doing at all. You're fighting against a chemical plant that is to be built on a godforsaken shore! My home is on that godforsaken shore! It's where I grew up. Before the plant is even built, they torn down our house. I think I messed it up again. So, you just want your home back. I thought what you wants is power. So, if I've gained more power, you'll like me. But I don't know how to tell you that I just want to be your family. I'm sorry. I didn't know it was your home. Stamp it. I want to quit. But I don't want you to leave. Ouch! It really hurts! What's this? 18 Copper Men Chinese herbal medicine. It's good for your nose bleeding disorder. There is no cure for the bleeding disorder. The peppermint inhaler is useless. At least, this will stop the bleeding. I'm not bleeding now. Give me your hand. What? The St. Arian chemical plant is about to be built. But rumor has it that the plant is the source of the new rabies virus. In the footage, we see our president get bitten by the St. Arian Prime Minister who is suspected to be infected with the virus. The presidential spokesperson expresses that the President has been treated and is fine for now. But the MPs call for an emergency meeting, asking the President to come to the parliament to report on the project. In addition to the President, MPs, including the newly elected Wang You-wei, MP-turned-assistant Hsiung Ying-ying and the plant supporter Li Kuo-chung, are attending. On the first day of the new session, clashes between the rivals are expected. (Two hours until) (the zombie crisis happens) (Wang Feng-hua aka HR Dragon) (Diagnosis of Stage 4 lung cancer) Good day, Feng-hua. What's good? Nothing! Morning! I mean morning… Well…　-What time is it? Almost eight. Call it morning? Yes, er, Feng-hua... It's ma'am. Or I'll keep you waiting till 8 pm. Yes, ma'am… Well, I want to quit my job. Please help me with the paperwork. Bloody fingerprint! Is it a petition? We couldn't find the stamp… Ask them to stamp it properly. I've come here, ma'am. The stamp is just a formality. You can make it, right? I can't make it unless it's correctly stamped. Can the HR department… Follow the procedure! You just need to…　-Follow the procedure! It's just a problem of a piece of paper. Why are you… I hope it's just a problem of a piece of paper too. But it's not. It's a problem of time. If you want to solve it, you should spot it earlier. Why did you wait till you're dying that you start to regret and want to quit? I don't regret it. I just want to quit. You really want a piece of paper, right? Rejected Wait. So… You had better go check on your dad. My dad? What's wrong with him again? What else? An emergency meeting is called. The President is coming to the parliament. Here I assure everyone that the St. Arian chemical plant is absolutely safe. In addition… What are you doing? Let go of me! It's dangerous! What on earth are you doing? I'm cutting grass. You're not standing on the grass. I'm cutting grass, you understand? You'll get arrested if you make trouble for the President. I'm not afraid of getting arrested! Stop making trouble! Who's making trouble? It's the President who orders to build the chemical plant over our home. They torn down our house without any notice. It's my home! (Mr. Hsiung aka Ferocious Gardener) Please, don't make any more trouble. I've already got so much on my plate. And I have to look after you too! You hardly came home! And you're talking about home? Please, can you stop being so selfish? Who is being selfish? I didn't mean… Have you ever thought about my feelings? I served in the army to support our family. I was an officer in the special force. Now I work as a gardener! What a joke! You're an MP and so what? It doesn't make any difference. They fired you and you had to go. Don't keep telling me how hard you've been trying. The harder you try, the sooner the plant will be built! I'll deliver justice with my own hands! I don't need you! (One hour until) (the zombie crisis happens) Ku Te-you, open the door. Open door! Hey! (Horse's sound) Open door! Open door! Open door! Open door! Open door! Stop pushing! Okay. Hey! Why didn't you open the door sooner? Still having drinks? Substitute military serviceman Ku Te-you, at your service. (Ku Te-you aka Flaky Substitute Military Serviceman) You didn't serve me at all! Why did it take you so long to open the door? Substitute military serviceman Ku Te-you, at your service. Lost your mind while clipping your nails? I'm Wang You-wei. I'll be discharged from the service in nine hours. I'll leave this goddamn place soon. Stop pretending we're mates, okay? At your service. So you'll be discharged? You forgot how I took you under my wing? Under your wing! You stood for the by-election without telling me! So now I have to cover for you! If you can choose, do you want to be an MP or security guard? Even if I stand for the presidential election, I'd tell my colleague who can't stand for any election! Whoa! What's wrong with you? I'm not your sweetheart. Why are you so angry? Watch your back! I warn you. In today's meeting, you had better make yourself clear. Just repeat what I say. If the St. Arian chemical plant is not stopped, I'll fight you to death. I thought you quit? I changed my mind, okay? Fine. Then you…　-Tell me. Do you support the St. Arian chemical plant or not? It's not as simple as support it or not. It's simple! How can they build it over my home? It's called diplomatic relations! What relations? Rabies relations? It's not confirmed that it comes from the plant! You wanna wait till everyone is infected? The plant cannot be built! Why can't you understand such a simple thing? It's never simple. It's politics! I never talk about politics! I'm talking about my home! Can't you understand? No, I can't. You know why? I don't know. I only know that… Because I'm an orphan! Mate, it's okay. Take a sip. Okay, you're an orphan and never have home. Even if you don't understand my feelings, you can't… Please, think carefully, okay? This may be the most important opportunity in our lives. You know why I asked you to stand for the election? Because I thought you were different. You wouldn't play dirty tricks like others. I felt you were… … pure. So I hope you remain as pure as you were. I hope I'm not wrong. I'll be in the public gallery on the second floor. Please don't let me down again. Good day, sir! Power Slam. What do you think? Am I cool? Yes. You didn't get injured, did you? I'm a bit shocked. Mr. Li…　-I've got a present for you. Thanks, but I need to tell you… I want you to join "The Better Generation". The what? The Better Generation. My team. I let you join us. What do you think? Cool.　-We even have uniform! But what I want to say is… What? Okay, thanks. But what I want to say is… Let's forget about the uniform. We've got a mission today. Listen. I'll deliberately disrupt the meeting. So when the President comes in, he won't have a chance to speak. In this case, the plant will be approved. Then I want you to put on a show with me. Like a wrestling game. We fight and make trouble. Don't you like wrestling? When it is done… I want to quit. You want what? To quit. You want to quit? I'm not sure I'm cut out for this job. Bullshit! It's because of Hsiung Ying-ying, right? You deliberately forced her to resign? Sonny, listen. What we're doing is above everyone's level. People like Hsiung Ying-ying wouldn't understand. When the plant is built and you're successful, she'll understand, right? So, whether the plant is making chemical weapons or Viagra, it has nothing to do with me. It makes no difference! Leave what happens in the parliament in the parliament. We work together during the day. I'll show you what's below the assembly room later. What's below the assembly room? Dumbass, do your job! Don't let me down! Let's go. (20 minutes until) (the zombie crisis happens) You won't kill yourself if you jump from here. Of course not! Rbbish! The AC in the assembly room is broken. They ask you to fix it in the mechanical room. Let them wait. You didn't kill the President, did you? Count himself lucky. I ran into my daughter. Damn, grown-up kids treat you like an idiot. She's very polite to me. You sure that polite woman is my daughter? Not really. She's so pretty that I can't see any resemblance between you. Funny, eh? You happy with your cancer report? Very happy. Stage 4. And you keep smoking? Anyway, I'm dying. Anyway, you've no family so no one will be upset. Well, thank you! But when you die, I'll have no one to talk to. Even if I wasn't ill, I hadn't got long to live. How old are you? 25? Still a girl! Wanna go to the mechanical room? Let them wait. What's hurry? I feel so hot that I can't wait. Let's go. What for? Let's fix it together. The meeting will start in 20 minutes. I don't expect you to last 20 minutes. (10 minutes until) (the zombie crisis happens) (Parliament Control Room) Damn, what's the noise? The MPs are such a mess! But don't worry, Mr. President. I won't let the MPs stop the chemical plant. When it's done, don't forget the premiership you promise me. Oppose violence! Oppose persecuting the President! Stop Li Kuo-chung making trouble! Let the session continue. Roger! Shut up! Get lost! Get lost! Li Kuo-chung! Wanna continue the session? I'll turn it into a funeral procession. We'll die with the President! Protect the President! Oppose questioning! Oppose questioning! Oppose… Oppose questioning! Lock the doors! Swallow the keys! Hey! What are you doing? Give me the key! I swallowed it! Swallowed it? Give it to me! Ignore him. Let the guards deal with them. What are you doing? You're actually helping them! You're colluding with Li again, aren't you? You lied to me again, didn't you? Get up, you wimp. Carry on! We... Please show your respect for the Speaker. Please don't splash water today. I repeat: Don't splash water today. Behave and be quiet. Mr. President, what's wrong with you? The President bites! Keep pretending, eh? What a dirty trick! Treat me like an idiot, eh? Stand down! Dear. I'm coming. Well… I think we should stop forcing him. Forcing who? The little man between your legs. So you're blaming me or him? Don't you think you should take the blame? Me taking the blame? I've never heard a man blame a woman for not getting hard. Would you like to use the fire ax instead? Maybe I'll feel better. At least it's hard. Still smirking? You can't even get a hard-on. You try to provoke me to kill you right here. Nonsense. You're afraid of dying alone at home. No one will know about it. So, you'll be rotting alone at home. Go to hell! Fuck!　-What are you doing? They're in the meeting.　-All of you, go to hell! What the hell? Having a party? Dear. You kicked my stomach. Get up! Why did you kick my stomach just now? I tried to pull you away from her. You could kick the wall. If I kicked the wall, we'd all fall to the floor. You could do something else. Why kicked my stomach? Can you stop arguing with me over this? You killed her.　-No, I didn't. She hit the ax herself. Help me! Help! We're doomed. This is the St. Arian rabies. The plant cannot be built. You sure you want to argue about it now? You didn't believe me! Watch your bottom! Listen. Go find the keys. They swallowed the keys. Tell me where he is. I saw a bastard swallow the key just now. The arrogant Taoist monk. He's in front of you. Go force him to throw the key up. Wang You-wei. Wang, come on, come hide in here! What are you thinking? Go help the monk! Dig the key out! Wang You-wei, you idiot! Come over, quick! What are you thinking? Go dig the key out of the monk! Come over, quick! Go dig the key out! Come on! Wimp! Go to hell then! Where is the key? The key! Let me help you. Whoa! Press on the artery! Press on the wound! Press on the wound! Artery. Press on your artery. Key… Where is the key? I swallowed it. Swallowed it? Yes, I did!　-Throw it up! Let me help you! Heimlich maneuver! What are you doing? I'm helping him throw it up! You look as if you were… Watch your back! This way. It's not working. What on earth are you doing? I can't do it… Throw up! Quick!　-My head is killing me. He's infected. One starts showing symptoms within a minute after being infected. Can you tell me something useful? Punch him on his stomach! See? You always need me. You wanna come down here and try? No. Hurry up! I've got the key. Move aside! Let me open it. It's open! It's open! What the hell? Open the door! Anyone over there? Open the door! What happened? How did this happen? What the hell! Damn! I forgot to push the bottom. Wait! I'm running! Again. I must open it. Open the doors! Open the doors! I'm still in here! People are in here! What the hell? Who is calling at this moment? Sir! Substitute military serviceman Ku, at your service. I'm the head of Agricultural Disease Bureau. Yes, sir. Oh, I see. I set up the Central Epidemic Control Center. And become its chief commander. Congratulations, sir! Yes, sir. The President contracted the new rabies virus in St. Arian. He's showing the symptoms and turning everyone into idiots. What we need to do is lock everyone infected in the assembly room. So I've turned on the security system. You understand? Yes, I do. Good, listen carefully. But excuse me, sir. I'm not infected. It's just a cold. Can I get out? If you can, why am I calling you? As a serviceman, you're very important right now. You should accomplish your mission at the most crucial moment. If anyone tries to escape, you have to deal with them immediately. You are the only serviceman here, understand? Because I'm straight. I don't care if you're straight or what. The point is… What did you say? Excuse me, sir. On the monitor. Excuse me, sir. I've got one here. What should I do? Use your brain. Use whatever you have at hand. Scissors. Too cruel! I've got a nail clipper. So what are you waiting for? Clip it! Clip what? His artery! He's stopped moving. Very good. What's wrong with you? I can't move either. Pull yourself together. Sing the song "substitute military service." No doubt, no complaint Walk into the crowd Very good. Chorus comes in now. The substitute military servicemen have dreams Love conquers the universe Enough. So, you've got my point? I seem to hear people shouting "help" inside. You've forgotten your duty? What's the motto of the substitute military service? Love, service, responsibility, and discipline. You know what responsibility and discipline mean? Listen. I'm your superior. Just listen to me. Ignore other things. If any MPs manage to get out, kill them at once. They're no longer humans, understand? But I'm not sure if they will accept it or not. You're disobeying my order? If the disease spreads, do you take the responsibility? No, but I have to! I warn you. If you don't obey me, you won't leave the service. I'm busy, so that's it! No, no, Sir! Can that serviceman be trusted? It's easier to blow up the whole building. Then it'll be under control. Let me see. AI detonation system. Yes, here it is. 8873762 Start the countdown to explosion. Two hours until the explosion (language of St. Arian) Yes, that's it. Love, service, responsibility, and discipline. Please walk quietly on the stairs. Love, service, responsibility, and discipline. Anyone in there? There are people in there! Save them? Run off? Run off. Run off. Open the lid. Press it. Press it. No… The substitute military servicemen have dreams Love conquers the universe (Please applaud) Told you not to disrupt their meeting! You-wei, the door on the second floor is shut too. Do you see if… Dad! Quick! What?　-Hold it for me. I can't lift it. What on earth can you lift then? What on earth are you doing in there? What should I do? Take off your clothes and give them to me. Take off my clothes now? Hurry up! Ying-ying, are you serious? They've all become zombies! Apart from one. Well, not anymore. Make a rope and let them climb up. You take off first! Then we'll do. Take off! I want to watch you. You feel cold? Take them off or not? Not your pants! Your shirt! Ying-ying. Where? Let's go. I see it! Come on! There is another at the back! Go, get off! Pull it! Get down! Throw! Don't… Don't kick me again! Don't kick me! Kick him. Good day, Mr. Hsiung. Good your ass! It's ready. Climb up! Get off. Quick! Climb up. Hold it.　-I've no strength to climb! Come on! Hang in there! Let me help. No need. Stop him! Yes. Quick! Move aside! Hello? You shut up! He's showing the symptoms. You are infected, now get out! I didn't get bitten. I'm just trying to throw up. I just want to throw up the key. Let me help you, Mr. Hsiung. No need. Get off! You damn bastard! You try to escape? Give me your hand! What are you doing?　-Move aside! It's not time to save the weak. The strong come first! Get down! You get down! Get down! Dad! They seem very sensitive to noise. I'll make another rope. You climb up from here. We just have to be quiet. Be quiet. Shh… Watch your head. Hang in there! I'll go get another rope. You should find the rope before smashing the glass. Squat down. Have you found a rope? Stop talking nonsense. Come on! I've got a rope. I'll tie it to the ax and throw it up. Catch it! Who are you talking to? Your daughter. Catch it! I've caught it! Stop filming! Tie it properly. Mr. Hsiung, you go first. You go first.　-You go first. You go first.　-Hurry up! Fine, I go first. Grab my hand!　-Careful. Don't pull me! Of course I have to pull you!　-Careful. Don't you pull me up! Your leg. Swing your leg over. Why on earth are you here? Mind your own business! Well, no…　-How are you feeling? I'm okay. I tried so hard to save you. Can't you talk to me nicely? I climbed up myself! Could you climb up if I didn't smash the glass? You know you nearly killed me with the glass shards? Enough! If you've the strength to argue, can you pull him up first? Wang You-wei. Wang You-wei, you scum! Oppose the plant! Wow, he can climb with one hand! Give me your hand! Give me your hand!　-Climb up, quick! Come on!　-Careful. You scared me to death! I thought you fell! You alright? I'm a bit shocked. You weren't so happy when I got up. I'm not happy. I mean I'm happy that you got up. Hey, what are you doing? They're coming up! Are you okay? Try to open the door! What to do? Ax! Wow, it's so hard! Anyone over there? Open the door! Substitute military serviceman Ku Te-you, at your... Fxxk! This is too much… Too late. Let's go! Don't! It's blocked down there. We need to find a room that can be locked! The War History Gallery! Come! Everyone, this way, quick! Run! You run! Just run! Run! Don't fight! What are you doing? Don't block the way. Go! Go! Get out of my way! Ying-ying. Get out of my way! Ying-ying! Get off! Run, quick! Run! Hurry up! Come on! What are you doing? Come on, run! Shut the door! Get off! What are you filming? Ying-ying. How do you feel about having been bitten? You alright? Li Kuo-chung, let me tell you. Thanks. I thought I was going to die. How are you? You okay? I'm okay. Good. I'm sorry. I shouldn't betray you. I shouldn't support the plant. I thought if I gained more power, you'd like me more. I know I'm useless. Really useless. Apart from nose bleeding, I can't do anything. Did you get bitten? 　-Wait. I haven't finished. Don't interrupt me. You're the only one who believe in me. An orphaned loser whose nose bleeds. Let me check. I like you so much. I've always liked you so much. I've always liked you so much since I was little. It's okay. Stay away from me. Stay away from me. Idiot! Idiot! No!　-Don't touch the door! No! Come on, help him get inside! Wang You-wei is infected! He isn't infected. His leg gets bitten and you're saying he isn't infected? His eyes! No changes in his eyes! Who cares about his eyes? If we don't throw him out, we'll all die! Fine. You don't want to get your hands dirty. Let me do it! Wang You-wei, I know you're not infected. Wang You-wei. If you hurt my daughter, I'll fight you to death! He isn't infected. He got bitten. Let him bite you and see what happens. See if you'll get infected. Dad, his eyes didn't turn red. Let me see. Really? Let me see. Let me check! Let me see! He's really not infected. If you want to live, kill him! Whoever doesn't want to live, die with him! Their eyes are red but his are black! Fuck off! Listen. If you're infected, your eyes turn red. Who cares about if their eyes turn red? Fuck off! You didn't watch the news? They say… Come on! Hold him tight! I'm going to kill him! Come back to me! You-wei You love me, you love me, right? He's come back. Ying-ying. He's come back! Let go of me! Press him down. I'm going to crack his head open. Throw him out! Let go of me! Don't! Ying-ying. No… Wait. We can't open the door. The zombies will rush in. It's fine! Don't stop me! Don't stop me! Look. Bleeding disorder… my blood is deadly poisonous. Whoa, how did this happen? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Answer it if you can hear me! Hello? Hello? HQ calling War History Gallery! Answer it if you can hear me! So cool! Mr. Hsiung, my blood works! Careful! It really works! Dear, watch out! Help! No, don't bite me! Help! Clip your artery! Clip your artery! Use my blood! Watch out! Fuck off! We've got someone here… His blood is so powerful. Come rescue us! Quick! Give me your blood. Blood. Here. Thanks. Why didn't you use your blood earlier? How would I know it could work like this? Move aside! Get out of my way! Come, let's see what it is. Stop filming! (Head of Agricultural Disease Bureau & Agricultural Special Force aka Shennong Force) Hello Mr. Wang. I'm the head of Agricultural Disease Bureau. And the director of Disease Control Center and the chief commander of Central Epidemic Control Center and the captain of the Agricultural Special Force. They're the Agricultural Special Force aka Shennong Force. Say hi to each other. Hi.　-Please step back. We need to take a blood sample from Mr. Wang. I've lost so much blood and you want to take my blood? It's not that we want your blood. On the monitor, we see that you seem immune to the virus. So we need to collect your blood. Please cooperate. Let all of us out. Then I'll give you my blood. Please see what they've got in their hands. You think it's a sugarcane? You think we come to work on the farm? We bring four guns with us. And you're bargaining with me? Let all of us out. Then I'll give you my blood. Yes, you heard him? Fine. You leave me with no choice. Slaughter the sick pigs! Move aside! 886872 664788 Damn, out of bullets! Fuck off! Ying-ying, you okay? Did you get injured? You're bleeding heavily and you ask if I'm okay? I have bleeding disorder so I'm used to it. Is it why you're immune? Maybe. Hey, are you okay? I'm okay. Mr. Hsiung, you alright? You're not too bad. You knew you should pass the gun to me. Not too stupid. Hey, you, come over! Tear your shirt up and use it as bandage on them. No, not there! No! I say no! Forget it. How can we get out? We can't. Obviously, they want us to die in here. Don't they want his blood? Yes, so if we don't try to get out, they'll send more people in. Li Kuo-chung, where are you going? You're a security guard? Try to control my movement, eh? You said you'd show me what's below the assembly room. What is there below the assembly room? You believe a joke like that? Is there a path leading to the outside? You're not serious about the joke... Kill him.　-Harder! Kill him! Kill him! I'm not afraid of you! Bring something tougher! Good. Use this.　-Clip it hard. Are you telling me or not?　-Yes, I am. There is a path below the podium. Liar. I've worked in this building for 20 years. Never heard of the underground path. Then why didn't you get out through the path? I don't have the key. Where is the key? Idiot! Can't you use your brain? Of course it's the Speaker who keeps the key! So we need to get the key from the Speaker. Even if we manage to get the key, how can we get to the path? Those things are crawling all over the room. Do you feel that they behave like dogs? You didn't notice that before? I mean the new rabies. And they're sensitive to noise. So, as long as we move discreetly, keep quiet and with You-wei's blood, we can walk through it. What do you think? Can you manage it? I'll try my best. Really? You can't… And we've got four guns. This one is still loaded. We can't waste any bullets. Did they bring any spare magazines? There are a couple. Loaded with agricultural products. It's dirty! We can still hit them with the guns. Let's get ready. Ready, go! Hey, wait a second. Can I have something harder? Damn, I kept a bunch of useless men. All rubbish. None of them is useful. I have to rely on myself. Security system, how long until the explosion? An hour. What? An hour? Blow it up in 30 minutes. The bombs will be denotated in 30 minutes. (language of St. Arian) Time to get out. (Speaker) What's the plan you said you had? Don't be afraid. I'll go down first. Careful. How is it down there? Any problem? No problem. Slowly. Hold it tight.　-Be careful! Keep an eye on my dad. Move! All of you, go to hell! Go! President, go to hell! Go to hell! I've got your blood! I'll make a big fortune! Li Kuo-chung. Open the door! Hang in there. The power of the blood is waning. Ying-ying. Watch out! Dad! Go, quick! Dear. Throw the loudspeaker over there! Go, quick! Go! All of you, go to hell! I'm fine.　-Dad, let me see. Let me check your bleeding arm.　-I say I'm fine. You're always like this. Let me see your arm. Ying-ying. Listen to me. Listen to your dad. I'm aware of everything you've done for me. I never told you one thing. Having a daughter like you is the proudest thing in my life. Stop talking. Let's go home. I want to go home with you. I want to go home with you too. But I'm sorry. I can't keep you company this time. You step back. I'll block them. I'll go. I can gain some time for you guys. Go pry the door open. Promise me that you'll lead Ying-ying out. You get it? No… Stop crying. You remember what I do every time you cry? I sing to you. Be brave. Go! Come on, you damn MPs! It's open. Come over, quick! Dear. Dad! Get in, quick! Dad　-Ying-ying, come on. You get quite hard this time! Quick, they're catching up! Are they catching up? No. I seem to hear them catching up. Just go! No, I did hear their voices. I don't know if they come from the front or behind. Wang You-wei. Wang You-wei. Mr. Wang, we're ordered to lead you out. The new rabies virus may trigger a pandemic. You're the only person who has the antibodies. Lead all of us out. I can lead only you out. Enough! Didn't I make it clear earlier? You want another fight? No, we're from a different department. We're from… I don't care where you come from. Too many people have sacrificed. If I get out, I'll take all of them with me. The WHO has confirmed that the new rabies virus can be transmitted by droplets. Everyone inside is infected. They just haven't shown the symptoms yet. The boss has ordered to blow up the parliament in 10 mins to kill the infected and stop the virus spreading. So you just leave them here on their own? The boss agrees to delay the bombing. But you have to come with us first. He won't stop the bombing until we get your blood. The sooner you get out, the sooner they'll be rescued. Go! I want to take you… … all of you out with me. You heard them. Only when you get out can you save us. And I don't want to spread the virus. But… The outside world needs you. We'll send people in to protect them. But you have to come out with us first. Go with them first. I trust you. It makes no difference to me. I'm dying anyway. I… I… Ma'am, let me help you. Don't die so soon. I'll get the serum ready. Do die too soon! I am not ready for this. Kill! The MPs are catching up with us! Didn't you say you'll protect them? Sacrifice is needed to achieve success. You should be prepared for that. Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go! You lost your mind? If you don't get out, you'll die with them. What's wrong with him? I don't want to be blown up. Let's go! Run! The place will be blown up soon. Why did you come back? We die together if we have to. I'm really… Moved? A little bit. What are you doing? Run! Here. Quick, run! Why told him you're from a different department? Idiot! You'll be dead men walking when I get out. Security system. How long until the explosion? 8 minutes. Shut up. Security system, open the door! (language of St. Arian) What? Speak Chinese! The authorization has expired. It will not work until it's re-verified. What? Open the door! Security system! Open the door! Security system, open the door! I say, open the door! I say, open the door! I wanna get out now! Quick! The ax… Quick! Shh… It turns out that I got bitten too… That bastard president… What happened to your arm? Thanks to your blood. Now I'm immune to it. Look at my arm… Cool, eh? Well… Is there any other exit? They won't let us out. Do you remember it? What happens in the parliament stays in the parliament. Ignore him. There must be another exit. Even if there is, you won't get out. I'm the only survivor. The only one who is immune. They need only me. I want to suck your blood dry! I…　-Shut your mouth. No, open your mouth. Here. What's that? 18 Copper Men Chinese herbal medicine. It heals wounds and increases the circulation. I'm dying and you're selling me drugs? Listen. You have to stand up. You can't die. My dad always took it. It really works. But I… This works better. We can't hold out anymore... My contact lenses! I feel a bit dizzy. Tell me how to fight. What? Like before, I follow your instructions. But this… I'll turn the volume to the highest. (Wang You-wei, you're chosen) I want to suck your blood dry! Swing to your left! Squat down. His legs are his weakness. Lift him up. His legs are his weakness. Lift him up. Pummel him with fire blazing fists. (Wang's blazing fists knock his opponent down) (His opponent's bottom is seriously injured) (He flies into a rage) (Wang fails to dodge the attack) (Ying-yang power slam!) (Wang gets slammed into the pool) (and temporarily loses his mobility) (Bitten by the opponent, Feng-hua gets infected) Wang You-wei, let's attack him together! Wang You-wei, jump! (Wang lunges at his opponent, pushing him to the floor) (His opponent feels the power of the background music) (and regains all his blood) Wang You-wei, use Huracanrana. Wow, he's so tough! Seize the moment and punch him. It's okay. Lift him up. I'll do the rest. You-wei, grab my feet. No, grab my hand. No, grab my hand. (With the coach's instructions and help from his teammates) (Wang You-wei beats his opponent) Are you alright? I'm a bit shocked. Only I can get out! (Li gets the fatal blow from the "The Pillars of Society" plaque) Serves him right! What happens in the parliament won't stay in the parliament. We'll find a new exit. I got bitten. You go, hurry up! Feng-hua, my blood may be able to save you. I have terminal cancer. I'm dying in any case. This place will be blown up soon. Try to find a way out, quick! We'll find a way… The Pillars of Society. I'm not that great. I mean I… I mean the plaque. Not you. Guess he tried to climb out through it. I'll gain you some time.　-Feng-hua. Ying-ying, I always thought I'd die alone. But look, before I die I've had so much fun with you guys. It's enough! Go, hurry up! Who says I have no family? Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Ready? 12345678 22345678 32345678 42345678 Come on! Finally, I'm discharged. Thank you for helping me. Open the door! What a St. Arian crap! It really sucks! Countdown to the explosion. God, I just wanna go home. Open the door! I've survived? Finally, we get out. Although the parliament is blown up, what happened in there won't be confined in there. The whole world knows the chemical plant is the source of the new rabies. My blood is the only antidote. I don't want to go back to the parliament at all. But this is the first time I feel I must and have the ability to help others. After the parliamentary election, we believe that we'll be better. We can change the world. We… We can exchange this vaccine for a lot of resources across the globe. But the vaccine is made from my blood. It counts as a kind of godsend. So I've decided to share this godsend with all human being for free. Nonsense! The parliament that got blown up in the rabies crisis has been rebuilt. Today it's open as the new session begins. In the War History Gallery, the objects used by the heroes are on display in memories of their bravery in the crisis. Everyone is welcome to pay it a visit. All of you, go to hell! Finally, I can leave this goddamn place. Nearly got blown up by those bloody officials. I wouldn't have made it without you. Thank you, sir. Ying-ying. I've got something for you. (Resignation letter) You want me to leave? No, but this place is too dangerous. The reason why you got into the parliament was to stop the plant being built. Now the project has been stopped. You've no reason to stay. No one will ever destroy your old family home. But I have to protect my new home. New home? Many responsibilities fell on my shoulders. I was tired of dealing with them. But you make me feel I can leave them to you. Now I only need to be your responsibility. You mean I'm your family? You still don't get what I said? I'm just not sure if your dad would agree. He would. He definitely would. It took us so long to develop a vaccine that can influence the whole world. Just because you want it to be free for all the government can't make a penny out of it. Is your blood so great? Tell you what. Your blood counts as a national asset. Who allows you to be so generous? (In memory of those who died) We live in the world where a lot of unfortunate things happen. I'm just trying to make it a better place because it's my home. No matter how bad it is, I just want to make it better. Bullshit! You know what you're talking about? It's against the government's political policy. I never talk about politics. What I talk about is my home! Get him!
