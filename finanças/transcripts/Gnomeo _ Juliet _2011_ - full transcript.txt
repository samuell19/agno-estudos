[orchestra tuning instruments] [baton tapping] [man] Shh! Shh! [clears throat] The story you are about to see has been told before. A lot. And now we are going to tell it again. But different. It's about two star-crossed lovers kept apart by a big feud. No one knows how this feud started, but it's all quite entertaining. Unfortunately, before we begin, there is a rather long, boring prologue, which I will read to you now. [clears throat] "Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona... ...where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes..." [horns playing fanfare] [Crocodile Rock instrumental playing] [man] Ah, Miss Montague, out you come to ruin my day. [woman] My, that's a hideous cardigan, Mr. Capulet. It suits you. [Mr. Capulet] Wizened old hag. [Miss Montague] You crumbly old codger. [tires screeching] [horns honking] [pig squealing] [rooster crowing] [rooster crows] [metallic creaking] Oh, great. [water drops clinking] [grunts] [lively chattering] No, this way! Whoa! [sniffing] [yawns] I got one! I got one! I got one! I got one! [whimpers] Winston! Throw us the ball! Huh? Huh? [grunts] [gasping] Tybalt! [coughs] [rattling] [retches] Oh, those Blues are at it again. [cork pops] [female] Top of the morning, Lord Redbrick! Lady Bluebuly. Your tulips are looking a little limp this year, aren't they? Oh! I don't like what you're incinerating. The proper word is "insinuating." Illiterate. I am not illiterate! My parents were married! [excited chattering] Benny! Come on. Let's go give those Reds another lesson on how it's done. [giggles] Yeah. - Shroom, all clear? - [Shroom chitters] [Lady Bluebury] Gnomeo! Gnomeo! - [Benny] Gnomeo! it's your mum! - Huh? Oh, no! Just get this out into the alley! I'll catch up with you. - OK, OK. - [Lady Bluebury] Gnomeo... Mum! Have you ever seen our beautiful, beautiful garden from this angle? Oh, yes. Especially the Wisteria. That tree was your father's pride and joy. May he rest in pieces. Oh, how you remind me of him. Oh. Which is why I wanted to say... - I know. I know. My chores. - Gnomeo... Edging, trimming, planting, pruning. Consider it all done. - I wanted to say... - Done, done. it's done like I did it. - Gnomeo! - Done. All I wanted to say was "good luck." Thanks, Mum. Go out there and show them we Blues are better than any Red! Red. I hate the word. [gasps] Wow! A Cupid's Arrow orchid! Oh! Juliet! Huh? Oh! Whoa!! Oh. [Lord Redbrick gasps] Hiya, Dad! You won't believe what I found! Do you want to get smashed? A flower that will put that Blue garden to shame, just across the alley. This feud business is none of your concern. And as leader of this garden, it's up to me to... Uh, I am a Red, after all. Oh, you're just as impulsivated as your mother was. Bless her to bits. - Now, back where you belong. - [frog burps] I can't just stay tucked away on this pedestal all my life. Don't you see? When will you realize you're delicate? I'm not delicate! She's definitely not delicate. [Lord Redbrick] Stubborn girl. [groans] Right. Delicate? Hmm! I'll show him who's delicate. [crowd murmuring] [Blues] Gnomeo! Gnomeo! [Reds] Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go! Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go! Gnomeo! OK, boys, y'all know the rules, and I don't need to repeat them. But I'm gonna, because I wanna. And here they are: No biting, no scratching, no kicking, no burping, no slurping, no cussing, no squalling, no rassling, no heeing, no hawing, and more than anything, no cheating! No cheating? Hey, that's not fair! - Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Gnomeo! - On your marks! Get set! - Sucker! - Go, go, go! [♪ Elton John: Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)] [cheering] [cackling] [engines racing] [chuckles] Huh? [rhythmically chanting] - [chuckles] - [engine roars] Aah! Whoa! No! Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go! - [Gnomeo yells] - [Tybalt cackles] [cackles] [engine racing] You're the greatest, boss. The greatest by far. The greatest! The greatest by far! Oh! Please, please, my friends. Tell me something I don't already know. A cheat! A cheat! That's what you are! A cheat! A cheat! That's what you are! [all grunt] Well, Benny, I didn't think it was possible, but your mouth is getting even bigger than your hat! Tybalt! You just crossed the line! Yeah! The finish line! [laughter] -Adios, loser! - [derisive laughter] Hey! Come on out and fight like a gnome! - Flower boy won't come out! - What's he gonna do? - You better do something! - He can't get away with that! - [crowd grumbling] - Show him! Show him! Come on! Well, if he won't come out, I guess we'll just have to go in. [gasping] The Red garden? No one's ever been in there! Then I'd say it's about time someone did. And payback is going to be fun. Shroom, let's go kick some grass. [chitters] This mission into Red garden territory is going to require maximum stealth. [Benny] Well, you won't get much stealthier than this. Hello! - [chuckling] - [spray-paint can rattling] [owl hooting] [snoring] [mumbling] I got one. [snores] [mumbling] I got one. Swim away. Be free. Oh! Thank you. [whimpers] [snoring] [mumbling] I got one. - [growling] - [gasps] [snorting, sniffing] [sighs] All this for some daffy flower. Yes. it's the only way I'll ever be taken seriously around here. And I'm gonna need you to cover, Nanette. If my dad asks, just tell him I'm washing my hair. "I'm washing my hair." I don't have hair! He'll know it's a lie! - No, my hair! - Got it! I'm washing your hair! OK, OK, whatever you say. I'll be quick. - [growls] - [gasps] - [barks] - [screams] Out! Out! [man] Damn, Spot! Over here, boy! [Spot whines] Wow! That was quick! I'm too easy to see. I'm gonna need some kind of disguise. Ooh! A new outfit! I'm on it. Here. That is cute. Give us a turn. Nice junk in the trunk. Now, go get your flower. Uh... Maybe a tad less fluorescent pink? How much less? Try black. [harrumphs] Huh? [shrieking] [giggles] Trust me. Nobody is going to pay you any attention in that. Then it's perfect. [shredding sounds] [grunting] Ooh! [speaking in Japanese] I'm going in. [shouting] Take care! I'll tell your dad you're doing your hair! - [Juliet sighs] - [door slams] Let's play a game. I'm thinking of a movie. It's one word, and it starts with, um, "Spider." [gnomes] Is it Spider-Man? Oh, you're good. OK. [conversation continues indistinctly] [chuckles quietly] [snoring] [gnomes giggling] - [loud rattling] - This is great! I love going commando! Shh! Now, just keep quiet. [metallic creaking] [paint can rattling] [paint can rattling loudly] Shh! [paint can rattling loudly] [rattling] [rattles loudly] [rattles loudly] OK, I have another one. Two words. The first word is "Spider-Man." [gnomes] Spider-Man 2? - OK, who's cheating? - [gnomes giggling] [chuckles quietly] Benny, give me the paint. Benny? - [spray-paint can hissing] - [Gnomeo] No. [Tybalt snoring] [rattling loudly] - Benny! Benny! - Oh! [laser beam buzzing] [laser beam beeps, chirps] - Huh? - Huh? - Tybalt! - Get them, you idiots! [gnomes] Come on, let's go! Run for it! Now! [grunting] - [Tybalt] Where did he go?! - [gnome] He's in the begonias! - Well, do I look like a begonia? - No, more like a pansy. Find him! - Not here. - Not here either. Nothing but daisies here. Come on! [gnomes grumbling] Hold on. - Whoa! - Whoa! - Hey, Benny. See you on the other side! - Gnomeo! No! [laughs] - [Tybalt growls] - [grunting] Huh? [distorted, slowed shouting] [owl hoots] [Mr. Capulet] Hmm? Huh? [growls] I wish I could stay, but gotta fly. [growls] [whimpers] Whoa-whoa-whoa! [yelling] Huh.

Well, I could ask you the same question, Tybalt. We're looking for a blue gnome. Yeah, he's an ugly little fellow. - Got a scratch, right here. -And his name's Gnomeo. You haven't seen him, have you? Uh... Ooh. Um... Uh... He sounds awful. No, I... I, um, certainly haven't seen him. I haven't seen him at all. Well, lucky you. Come on. Let's get inside. [softly] Juliet. A Red. Why, of all things, did she have to be a Red? So, where is the oh-so-important, life-changing orchid? Um... Um... What... What orchid? What? Hmm? Shut up! You met a boy! What? No. Well, maybe, son of. Um... Yes. Yes, I did. I need details! And go slowly! - Is he totally gorgeous? - Totally. Does he have a nice rotund belly? Well, let's call it sturdy. And his, uh... His hat is, um... - Big and pointy? -And... ...you know, I suppose in a certain light, you might say it looks son of... blue. [crickets chirring] Blue. Ah! This is one of your little jokes! [laughing] No, I don't get it. [gasps] Oh! Flipping, flaming Nora! She's smooching the face off a Blue! Shh! Please shush, Nanette. Just zip it. Zip. [stifled giggling] Oh! Juliet! This is fantastic! - Is it? - it's doomed. - What? -A Red and a Blue. It just can't be. So it's a doomed love, and that's the best kind. You'll never see him again. And then one day when you die, you'll be all... "Oh, my true love. I only saw him once." [gasps] [melodramatic moaning] I'll only see... What do you mean... What are you chatting about "once," I'll only see him once? How romantically tragic. Your love is doomed. Your love is dead. Your love is doomed. Your love is dead. It's doomed. Dead. - I'll only see him once? - Doomed! [gnome 1] I've never seen Lord Redbrick so riled up. We have to find Gnomeo. Let's split up. [both grunt] [sighs] I wish I could quit you. [both] Hmm! [gnome 1] Oh, well, let's go fishing. - [sniffing] -All right, boy. [sniffing] Go find Gnomeo. Doomed. Dead. Doomed. Dead. Doomed. Dead. O Gnomeo, Gnomeo, are we really doomed, Gnomeo, to never see each other again? Why must you wear a blue hat? Why couldn't it be red like my father, or... or green like a leprechaun? Or purple like, um... like, uh... like some weird guy? I mean, what's in a gnome? Because you're blue, my father sees red, and because I'm red, I'm feeling blue. Oh. At any rate, that shouldn't be the thing to keep us apart, should it? No! No, it shouldn't! I couldn't have said it better myself! Oh, my giddy aunt. Did you just hear all of that? What are you doing here? I don't know. Um... I came here to... Well, I don't know, I just wanted to see you again. Are you crazy? If Dad finds you, he'll bury you under the patio! Find me. You kidding? "Stealth" is my middle name. [motor humming] [The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room plays over loudspeaker] No! Quick! Turn it off! I'm trying! - Do something! - The button's stuck! Come on. Aah! Juliet! It won't turn off! - There's something behind you! - Shroom! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Juliet, what's with the...? [mumbling] Ooh! You look like a fun-gi. - Excuse me, a little help here. - [Juliet] My dad's coming. So, you must be Gnomeo. Lovely to meet you... in the 30 seconds before you're discovered and killed. - Quick, hide. - Juliet, I've told you before, no music in the grotto after 10:00. [electrical crackling] - What's going on here? - Um... It was a... um... I saw a squirrel, and he... he dropped his nuts. Yes, nuts, the size of... boulders! Yes, all right. Thank you, Nanette. Well, OK, but no mucking about, especially not tonight. We've been attacked, by a Blue! And if I ever get my hands on a Blue, he'll be sleeping with the fishes! Now, I'm not a man who is wounded up easily! Lord Redbrick, I've been having problems with my... - [mumbles] - Your what? I guess this isn't the best time to talk. - it's not ideal. - But I... - Just go. Please go. - ...just came here to say I... - What? You what? - I'm... - Oh, sorry. - Juliet, is there something wrong - with the pond? - The pond? No. What, this pond? No, it's fine. I mean, it's just as pondy as ever. Oh, my gosh! What is that thing over there? - What? What was it? - The... thing, over there... - What did it look like? - Oh, it looked like a really... OK, bye-bye then. Off you go. Thanks for popping by. Good night, sweet prince, and flights of angels... or pigeons or sparrows or whatever. Parting is such sweet sorrow. [chittering] [Gnomeo sighs] Ah. Nanette, where's Gnomeo? Is he gone? - Yeah. Gone forever. - What?! [grunts] Whoa! I think you'll find this does, actually, belong to you. Thank you. [clunking] [Juliet chuckles, grunts] [Gnomeo grunting] - I can't go. - I know how you feel. No, really, I'm stuck. [both chuckling] So, uh... can I see you again tomorrow? - Yes, but not here. - Back in the old Lawrence place, then? - Noon? - Not soon enough. - I can do 11:45. - Done. That frog was right. Parting is such sweet sorrow. - [wood creaks] - Whoa. Thanks, Nanette. You know he's going to ditch you when he finds out how much you weigh. Shroom, do you see this face? It's a happy gnome face. Now, come here. Come on! [Miss Montague humming, singing Don't Cha] [weather vanes creaking] - [clattering] - [Miss Montague shrieking] [Mr. Capulet] Outrage! Infamy! The gardening gloves are off then, are they? [Miss Montague] You! Wrecking my mower! Dear lady, you are insane in the brain! [Miss Montague] I never thought even you'd stoop to such levels! [Mr. Capulet] Oh, and by the way, kindly stop stealing my underwear. [Miss Capulet] In your dreams, you daft old cabbage! Oh. How could she do this to Tybalt's wishing well? Oh, my sweet little flower boy. Why would anyone ever pick on you? [Miss Montague] Oh! Who thinks I should order the best new lawn mower money can buy? Oh... [mutters] [chuckles] Why would anyone do this to Tybalt? [gnomes] Because nobody likes him. - [growls] - So, what are we going to do? Find their weak spots. Then what are we going to do? Damage. Lots and lots of damage. [chuckles] [both chuckling] [all laughing maniacally] [Fawn laughing alone] - [laughter fades] - [keyboard clacking] [Miss Montague] Right. Mess with me, will you, Capulet? I'll show you, you old sack of compost. This is not over. Not by a long shot. [glass squeaking] Ah. Right. What do we got here? She's on the Worldy Widey Web. - Uh, no. No, no, don't think so. - That one! Pick that one! - Ooh! That one! Yes, I like that one. - No, don't think so. - No, no... That one! - Oh! What's this? [deep male voice] Are you losing the war in your garden? Well, brother maybe it's time for a secret weapon. Terrafirminator! It's the most ruthless, 500-horsepower, grass-dominating piece of hardware the world has ever seen! Terrafirminator! It's unnecessarily powerful! Now with 75 percent more power! - It clears! - Clears! - It digs! - Digs! - It mows! - Mows! Your lawn will be afraid to grow! Terrafirminator! It's a weapon of grass destruction! Terrafirminator will not inhibit grass from growing. Not recommended for residential use, brother [chuckles] That one! [Miss Montague] Oh, my. Pick... that one! Please, please, pick that one! - Oh, dear. - Yeah, yeah, yeah... - [Benny gasps] - That's a bit in your face. - This is more my speed. - [gasps] [kitten] Meow Oh! Not the Kitten Clipper! Oh, no. [glass squeaking] [♪ Elton John and Kiki Dee: Don't Go Breaking My Heart] Definitely not. Huh? OW! [shrieks] - Juliet? There you are. - Hi, Dad. I've been ruminating about our little discussion yesterday. - But I was just... - What you need is compan-man-ship. Someone to look after you. Who'll keep you safe. - What? - You know Paris, don't you? Yes. Yes, of course. Why? - He's come to pay you a visitation. - Dad! All right, all right. No one would ever say I don't know when I'm not wanted. - Toodles! - Got something for you. Here it is. Gypsophila. Lovely. What does it mean? It means "lover of chalk." Although, ironically, it grows better in a clay soil. It's weird. You think you got it down, and then, bam, you do some reading, it turns out it likes clay soil, even though you thought it was a lover of chalk. Weird. Right. Well, it's been terribly nice speaking with you. Where are you going? Stop! No! Obviously, do whatever you want. But my point was, surely, it's a bit rude to leave me on a first date. - "First date"? - Yeah. - I thought, what does a boyfriend... - "Boyfriend"? - ...get his girlfriend? - "Girlfriend"? Ooh! This is good! A small token of my affection. Oh. Wow. Juliet, do you realize what this is? It is my own hybrid of foxglove and buttercup... - A love triangle! - ...which I call "foxbutt." And you! I never knew you were such a devil! [giggles playfully] No, I mean, you know, I've got my dark side, sure. Hey there, Juliet. What a name. it's a great name. Goes with your... eyes. You're looking really cool. You're looking good. Did it hurt when you fell down from heaven? That's a killer, man. Yeah, no. You're looking cool. Yeah. - How's it going with you, baby? - Oh, I'm fine, baby. How are you? Uh... uh... Never better. - [wood creaking] - [Gnomeo] Huh? [whispers] Do you think anyone heard that? [whispers] There's nobody here. - Then why are you whispering? - Why are you whispering? [giggles] Oh! Look at that! Guess we're done with the whispering thing then. It's a 1950s MacAllister Ranger. - Let's start her up! - Yeah! OK. Check out the power on this beauty. [engine sputters] - [chuckles] - [sputtering] She's empty. Bingo. - Hey, try this. - Thanks. [both coughing] [door creaks, slams] [low creaking] [clinks] - [Juliet whispering] Is that you? - [whispering] Yeah. Yeah, it's me. - [both chuckling] - [male] it's me, too! [both scream] - What was that? -I have no idea. OK, whatever you are, come out slowly! I have a loaded st... uh, weapon! And... And I'm not afraid to use it! - Do you think I scared him? - Oh, definitely. I know I'm scared. Look at that baby, huh? Watch me now! [humming rhythmically] By the way, thanks for finding my leg, and setting me free. I love you! Do you know what it's like to be trapped for 20 years? All alone by yourself, no one for to talk at? [speaking in Spanish] [replying in Spanish] "How's the other leg?" "I don't know, Featherstone, remember? I don't have it." You see, I'm not exactly terrific company, am I? Sony, but we didn't think anybody lived here. Yeah, we shouldn't be here. We'll be going. - What if he follows us? - Then our parents find out. Oh, no. Nanette was right. We're doomed! [tut-tutting] You cannot ever pull the wools over these beady eyes. Ho-ho! I think that you two are on a date. - Date? No! No. - Date? No! No. - Not dating. Fighting. - Fighting to the death. - Modal enemies here. - Yeah, don't you see it? - He's a Blue! -And she's a Red! And I'm pink! Who cares?! Anyway, I got to ask. Why are you bringing her to a dumpy place like this? [gasps] I know! I know! [speaks Spanish] I be right back! - [engine running] - Juliet, wait. Oh, here it comes. I'm too delicate, right? No, no. I was going to say, don't hold back. Let her rip. - Oh! Really? - Yeah. Go! - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - [giggling] [laughing] Whoo! Wow! Ta-da! Look at that! it's a definite improvement. Fantastic penmanship, too. But, you know, we still gotta do something about these weeds. They're not weeds. Those dandelions are wishes. I don't know. A weed by any other name is still a weed. Go on. Make a wish and then blow on it. [inhales deeply] [sputters] [inhales] [sputtering] it's kind of hard with a beak, huh? Kind of tires you out, huh? I go to sit down now. [both chuckling] I've got a confession to make. I've never actually driven a mower. No, you're a natural. Well, my dad, he's a little overprotective. You know this is crazy, right? Yeah. I just never imagined that I could fall for a Red. And me a Blue. No way. My whole life, my mum raised me to hate you guys, you Reds. So, this could never work. Could it? Well, a Red and a Blue, it just can't be. Can it? [Featherstone sputters] Look! it's kind of like snowing, but it's not. Oh, baby, you know, I getting into this now. See, the trick is to go like... Then you get them all with one. You don't have to... Ah! I wish that we could all come back and do this tomorrow. And, uh... I promise, your secret is safe with me. Well, should we? I can do 11:45. Not soon enough. [sighs] [sighs] Hey, Shroom. What's up, button head? Careful there. You're going to chip something. What's eating you? [gasps] [Lady Bluebury sniffling] [crying] How? How? - Mum! - Gnomeo! How could this have happened? Where were you? I was... [sniffles] I was nowhere. Don't worry, Mum. I'll make it up to you. How?! Redbrick and his hoodlums have destroyed the most beautiful thing we Blues have. Your father planted her. We raised her from a seedling. [bunnies wailing] [bunny growls] [wailing] Those blasted Reds! Come on, Gnomeo! We'll make them pay! [clamoring] Every last one of them! [Benny growls] Every last one? [♪ Elton John: Your Song] [clears throat] [singing off-key] My dad can really pick them. Can't he just? - Oh! This is painful. - Oh! Sweet torture. [singing melodically] [singing off-key] - Ooh, shiny, shiny. - Nanette? [Nanette giggles] [chuckles] [Serenade ends] [hippo grunts] [gasps] Gnomeo. [hippo 9895] [Fawn humming Rockabye Baby] [Tybalt snoring] [whispers] OK. [gasps] [singing in Spanish I've Got A Lovely Bunch of Coconuts] [exhales] - [gasps] - Huh? Juliet, no, wait! I... I... - [humming softly] - [snoring] [hippo grunting] A Blue! A Blue! - Abort, abort the mission! - What, what happened? Uh... The nozzle jammed. Let's go. [grunts] Gnomeo? [gasps] Hmm... [Tybalt] Such a big hat for such a small gnome. So, you boys fancy a little bit of fun? Let's take this baby out into the alley. Then what are we going to do? We're going to have a smashing time. [laughing] Aw, come on, Juliet. it's not as bad as all that. Is that your big move on a second date? You wine them, dine them, and then spray them with weedkiller? You've got to admit, it is original. Hola! My fellow funsters are back already. Juliet, be reasonable! I didn't have a choice after "incident Wisteria." How do you think that looks? Just a toilet, in the middle of a yard, with nothing growing out of it. - You Blues are so infuriating! - Wait a minute. Us Blues? - So, what you guys want to do? - Featherstone, we're busy! Come on, guys! Let us have some fun! Let me tell you something about you Reds. Us Reds? Can't we all just laugh about this? I know your little mushroom dude can. - Featherstone! - Featherstone! - We're in the middle of something! - You wouldn't understand. - Do you mind? - Just leave us alone! Right. I'm sorry. You know, sometime I get a little overexcited. Especially having such great new friends. Like you, and... But I know I can be a bit... much. Wait, Featherstone. Hey... [Juliet] Come back, Featherstone. I'm sorry. [Featherstone] I may not be a smart bird, but I know what love is.

[Shroom chitters] [Benny] Gnomeo! What are you doing?! Benny! Listen, mate, I can explain. Benny! Benny, wait! - [engine races] - [Benny yelps] Well, well, well. if it isn't little Big Hat Benny! - Mess with our garden, will you? - [gasps] - [laughing] - [tires screech] Benny! - [trowel clanks] - No!

The wall! You don't think I'm going to fall for that old trick, do you? What wall? [gasps] Oh. That wall. - No. - [shattering sounds] - What was that? - What's happened? Tybalt? Tybalt. Tybalt? [gasps] Tybalt can't be with us anymore. [gasps] Ooh. Smash him back! No! What is the meaning of all this constipation? Gnomeo smashed Tybalt! - No! He didn't do it! - Juliet! - Gnomeo! - Mum! A gnome for a gnome! - Catch! - What? [grunting] Smash him back! Run, Gnomeo! Run! [clamoring] Stop! Stop that! Revenge! Oh? [all gasping] [clinking] jogger gasps] Oh... - What are you doing? - No! I love him! - What? - Doomed. Oh! Someone do something. [shattering sounds] [gasping] Gnomeo! Are you mad? There's been enough smashing for one day! Now get her on her pedestal and keep her there! [crying] He's gone. Oh, no... gone. Oh, Gnomeo. No... No, not Gnomeo. Let's get you home, now. [sobbing] Oh! My poor, poor boy. [sniffing] [sniffing] [brakes squeak, hiss] - [slobbering sounds] - Hmm? Stay. Stay! - Good boy! - [growls] Shroom! Shroom! [chittering] [Gnomeo moaning] - [growling] - [people shrieking] [horn honking] - [growls] - [grunts] [barking] [barking] [panting] - [rumbling] - Huh? No! - [laughing] - [boy 1] Hey, what's this? A gnome? [boy 2] Yeah, mate. It looks like your sister. - [laughter] - [indistinct chattering] Whoa! Don't drop it! Come on, pass it! You left me no choice, Juliet. I've lost your mother. I am not going to lose you. [thunder rumbles distantly] [Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word instrumental playing] [sighs] Psst! Psst! Bunnies! Fall in. All right. We've got to avenge Gnomeo. Here's what we're going to do. Now... [Benny muttering] No, not now, Shroom! [Shroom chitters] Right. Got in OK. OK! Little mushroom dude, I'm coming. What? What are you trying to say? [frantically chittering] So, Little Timmy has fallen down the well? No? Little John? Little Mustafa? Little Richard? What?! Oh. A teapot fell down the well. What? Gnomeo. You saying Gnomeo fell down the well? No, little mushroom, he was smashed. I saw it myself. What? You want I still should follow you some more. OK, fine. I going with you. I go. But what this has to do with Gnomeo, I don't know. And where is this well everyone is falling into? [creaking] Psst! [squeals] [clinking] Hmm? Ready? Ew. Hmm? [shrieks] [groans] Yuck! Hmm? Ooh! Hello. [thumps] [glass squeaks] [grunts] Whoa! [grunting] - Hmm? - [screensaver beeping] [shrieking] - [computer chimes] - [groans] [plays intro melody on keyboard to Benny And The Jets] [chuckles] [kitten] Meow [deep male voice] Terrafirminator! - Are you losing the war in your garden? - Never! Well, brother maybe it's time for a secret weapon! - Bring it on. - Terrafirminator! This one's for Gnomeo! [Terrafirminator voice] Meow! [tires screech] [squealing frantically] Huh? [Benny laughs] Yeah! - [door opens, slams] - Huh? [whimpers] Come on! [Miss Montague] Oh! Ruddy purse. [door slams shut] [chuckles] Call me. [Gnomeo] So Juliet and me, we decided that we'd carry on in spite of the feud. It was great, but then my best mate Benny found out, and then Tybalt, who's a right piece of work by the way, crashed a trowel through Benny's hat. I was so livid that I attacked Tybalt and he ended up getting smashed, which wasn't my fault, and I was chased out. Exiled. Stuck up here on your head, far away from Juliet. Extraordinary. Your story, it does put me in mind of another. It does? Oh! Indeed! Yes, there are remarkable similarities. What happens? Do they get back together then? Get back together? Um... No, not exactly. What exactly do you mean? Well now, it really is quite good. She feigns her death. He finds her, thinks her dead, takes his own life. She wakes, finds him dead, takes her life, both dead. Exeunt omnes, the end, curtain! Standing ovation! Bravo! Bravo! Author! Author! Hmm. [Gnomeo] What did you say?! They both die?! What kind of an ending is that? My dear boy, this is a tragedy. Yeah, you're telling me, mate. it's rubbish! - "Rubbish"? - Gotta be a better ending than that! I suppose that he could've made it back in time to avert disaster, but I like the whole death part better. Oh, dear. [yelling] [Featherstone] Whoo-hoo! Featherstone! One word! [inhales deeply] - [pops] - Plastic. How did you find me? Shroom! He sniffed you out. And he doesn't have a nose. I checked. Yeah, I knew I could count on you, you little button head! - [chittering frantically] - What is it, boy? He hasn't stopped, yakety-yakety-yak! He's been going on and on and on since the alley. Chocolates in stranger, chocolates in stranger, chocolates in stranger... Juliet's in danger?! No, that's not it. Juliet's in danger! Told you so. Come on, boys. I've got to get back to Juliet and save her! That's what he said, but she was dead before he got home! [Gnomeo] We'll see about that! Whoa! [gulps] Ta-da! [cheering] Benny. What do you think, Lady B? This baby is fully equipped. Equipped for what? It has settings for edging, trimming, mulching, and revenge! [cheering] Do it, Benny. Do anything it takes! Make them rue the day they destroyed my son! Unleash the dogs of war! [high-pitched war cries] - [chuckles] - [computer beeps, engine revs] - [alarm blaring] - [rumbling] [Terrafirminator voice] Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, Eve, four; three, two, one! - [horn blares] - [tires screech] - [shrieking] - [growling] No! No! Oh! [Benny] Yes! [laughs] [screams] Oh, no! Oh, blimey! Oh, no! [engine revving] Attack! Counterattack! [battle horn sounding] Counter-counterattack! [little gnome yelling] - Fire! - Incoming! [taunting] [counting to three in German] Hey! I got one! Thank you! [whimpers] Move it! No! No! Paris! Gentlemen, I suggest we put our heads together. Charge! - Oh, no, no, no! - Yee-haw! - Hang on! - Whoa! Whoa! [Gnomeo] Thanks! Juliet! You're alive! - Come with me. - OK. Oh, no. No, no! [engine revving] [computer voice] Would you like a complete destruction now? Destruction in progress. Get him! Come on! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! [whirring, revving] Juliet! My son! It can't be. [Terrafirminator voice] Target locked. She's going to blow! Get back! Get back! [all gasping] it's no use. Go. - Go. - I'm not going anywhere. Told you so. [weather vanes creaking] [stones scraping] [groans] - [chittering] - Huh? [both gasp] No. [chittering] [sniffing] [sighs] [cries] - [gasping] - Huh? It’s OK! I'm OK! Oh, good. I'm sorry about your son. I'm sorry about your daughter. I was just trying to keep her safe. And now, the whole thing is my fault. Our fault. This feud... Is over. [electrical buzzing] [distorted music plays over fountain] Move! [music dies] [gasps] [laughter] [cheering] I don't know about you, but... ...I think this ending is much better. - [rooster crows] - [pig squealing] - Good afternoon, witch. - Nitwit! [back doors opening] [Miss Montague and Mr. Capulet screaming] [♪ Nelly Furtado and Elton John: Crocodile Rock] [Wedding March playing] [giggles] Thank you!
