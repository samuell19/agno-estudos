(calming music) (ominous music) (alarm blaring) (dog barking) (train horn honking) (guns firing) - You, yes you turn around, make it slow. Okay little man you better start talking. - Morning? - A comedian! And what are you doing out at this time, comedian? - Pardon? - I said what are you doing out at this comedian? - I'm just taking the dog out for a walk, actually. - Okay little man. But just watch it eh? - Watch what? - [Albert Voiceover] Control yourself Albert, you've had enough excitement and danger to last for a while anyway, but the time has come to take things a bit more easily, you've had a go poking your nose in, mind you, did very well out of it though didn't you, what are you now, a civil servant? Government employee, a position of responsibility. Funny thing, imagination, I reckon mine must be more developed than anyone else's, because I use it more I suppose, simple as that. Why don't things work out as simple as they do in comics or books? Funny thing, life, the solution will seem easy, all cut and dried and them it all gets scrunched up. First it was the accidents, calamities. How did it happen? Of course now I remember how it all started. Oh yeah it was that night in the front room. (foreboding music) I must've been about 11 or 12. That's right, Mom and Dad weren't there, they'd left me with a babysitter, huh, babysitter at my age. Chloe, that's right, she was about 19. She read those silly romantic books all the time, hah, never took any notice of me anyway. It was after that I realised that girls weren't just boys with longer hair and prettier legs. I suppose I was a bit frightened with my imagination, I used to sort of stand outside and never become involved. Just a disinterested spectator, nah, of course what really frightened me was the possibility that my imagination would get me into some sort of trouble, and what I didn't know was that all it required was the right set of circumstances and a sort of gunpowder to trigger it off. Something that would turn me into Superman. Or SuperAlbert. And I didn't know that this gunpowder would prove to be, well, an everyday commodity. (guns firing) It happened that morning, a challenge came through the letterbox, one of the chosen few. Maybe the only one? Well the only one in this street anyway, nobody else I knew fitted that description, virile. What a marvellous word, there was a ticket with the circular for a place called The Red Mill. The area wasn't quite the place I thought a gentleman's club would be. Well there seemed to be an awful lot of funny places around and all those girls, wonder where they came from, or go to for that matter, lots of strange people about too, I didn't know then that there were two men sitting at a nearby bar planning an investigation connected with the place that I had a free ticket too. Really it was their last chance, they were the champion bunglers of the civil service, supposed to be inconspicuous. With bowler hats in Soho? - Good afternoon Mr. Parks. (anticipatory music) - Oh, oh I'm sorry I'm late boss. - [Man] Oh, have I come to the right place? I was told to come out here. - Dude, listen to that, they're gonna lynch him one of these days. - He's a very intelligent boy who will go far. - Right, they chucked him right through these doors yesterday, that's about as far as he's gonna go, right on his head! - I've told him to use the cloche I gave him. He won't listen, just won't beat up a member of the audience there's the old school boy, if he wasn't the wife's brother. - [Man] Hello sir, do come in. - No sir, just, I'm just looking. - Ah faint heart ne'er went over naked ladies, it's cold outside, come right through. - Good afternoon sir, and welcome to the famous Red Mill Club, no need to be shy sir, do stand up. - I am standing up. - Yeah well it certainly tells me you must've received one of our, oh yes, you'll like it here son. There's a lot of fine gentlemen like yourself in there. - Oh really. - Oi, 50 pence. - Oh... - So what do they call him? - Just a minute, it says welcome to Woburn Abbey on this. - We have a large organisation. I'm off, gotta get the next consignment ready. - Mr. and Mrs. Ass, (mumbling), but it was in July, so when they arrived, Mr. and Mrs. Ass, they called their, oh no sir, I'm afraid you will have to find a seat, unless you want to come up on the stage and take off all your clothes? (hollering) You'll love them dear, I had them eating out of my hand. - How many fingers you've got left? - Oh, one... (swanky music) (applauding) (anticipatory music) - Thank you, you're fantastic. (applauding) (swanky music) - [Albert] Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean to get your, uhm, oh I'm sorry! - Harry! (hollering) (whistling) (applauding) - Well? - Fine, thanks. - Don't look at me, has he come back yet? - Don't know I'm not looking! - Where's your standard issue mirror, (mumbling) sneaking for? - Hanging in your bathroom up. - Oh yes. - Where's yours? - In your wife's compact. - So that's why? - Exactly! - Ah you're hurting me! - Peanut? - Action stations! - You brute! Are you all right? - No. - If I catch you going through the boss' desk again Stella, I'll have your guts for garters. - Thanks for your help, but I wish you hadn't. Oh come on, you're in a hell of a mess, we'd better get you cleaned up. - No thanks, that's very nice of you, no, I'll be all right. No, I really will, thank you very much. - Harry you are rotten. - What's that love? - I wish you wouldn't do those blokes over in the middle of my act, what it must've looked like, I dread to think. - Well sorry that bloke was making himself a nuisance back there. - Suppose there had been someone out there, fat chance I had ever been discovered. - Sorry. - You don't think! - Think, think? - What's all the ruckus about Harry? - Well it's Desiree, she's upset. - Oh for, I mean the little guy and Stella. - Oh I caught Stella going through your desk back there, didn't take nothing though. - Well I never keep money there, you know that and so should she, let's have a look at that desk. Go and put some clothes on, you'll catch a death of cold or something. - Do you know what I think? - No. - That must be the girl. - What, that one in the club? - I beg your pardon, oh yes. You know what had me fooled? - Well the enormous uh-- - Exactly the enormous confidence. - Yes, there's that too. - Why is she doing this? - Well perhaps at heart she's just a level below show-off. - Are we talking about the same girl? - No, I don't think we are. - That girl, you numbskull. (mumbling) - Oh yummy. - Oh yes. - Fosdyke? - Yes Chumley? - The book. - Precisely, the book. - Come on, come on! - Come on in. What you say your name was? - Albert, Albert Toddey. - Well the bedroom's in there Albert. - Is it? - Yes, go and take your clothes off and I'll be with you in a second, tea or coffee. - Uh tea, please. - Here you, the bedroom. You heard me, Mister, the bedroom, fast! Oh Albert, you didn't think I was talking to you. - Well, yes. - Have you got a dog? - Uhm, no. - Well don't bother. They're more trouble than they're worth. Oh dear, I think I need cigarette. Have you seen my handbag? - Uh no I don't think that I? Oh, sorry. - Would you like one? - No thank you. - Come on! We've got to get you out of those clothes. - What all of them? - Yes of course. You're soaked through, oh Albert, you didn't imagine that you? - No, no, no, no. - You've been watching too many films, go and change in the bedroom, wash your face and we'll put your clothes in the spin-dryer - Oh, oh yes, thank you. (swanky music) What was happening at that club, Stella? - Well it's a long story, something very strange going on there. - Strange? - Yes, girls keep on disappearing for one thing. - Disappearing, where do they go? - Well they just vanish, working in the club one minute. Gone the next! It's a bit of a mystery, they're never seen again. - Hmm, they must all get offers from that (mumbling). - Perhaps. - Stella is there anything for me to put on. - Yeah, but have you finished? - No, nearly. - There's a dressing gown on the back of the door, put your clothes in a pile, and I'll collect 'em. - All right. (dog barking) Hey why did that fella want your handbag? - He wanted a book, he didn't get it though. - Why not? - Yeah, that's funny. Maybe he didn't know about the book. - He wanted a book he didn't know about? Well what was in it? - Addresses, at least I think it's add... - Well I don't think you ought to be working at a place where girls keep disappearing and blokes come out and knock you on the head just because they wanna borrow your address book, why don't we go to the police? I mean, you can't sit here and let them get away with it Stella, Stella? Stella? Stella? (frolicking music) Oh? Telephone, telephone? - I was right, it is him, Clacton-on-Sea, 1944. Don't you remember? - Good day Madam. - Good day. - How are you? - Not too bad. Thank you. - Good! Locked yourself out love? - [Albert] Uhm, no no it's all right, I'm just polishing my knockers. - [Man] Good I'll come back and help you later. - Yes you do that, oh my God. - Well if the girl just ran into the flat, who is the other girl in the car? - I have a feeling that the girl in the dressing gown with the heavy makeup was in fact, are you ready for this? - Ready. - The little chap at the club. - Ready? Never! - The little chap at the club. There's only one way to find out. - Oh dear. - Disguise 47. - Why don't we ever wear disguise 22. - You know it doesn't suit me. - But it's my favourite! - Right now, let's have a look at your knockers. - I beg your pardon! - [Man] Number please. Hello, hello? - Hello. - Can I help you sir? - I think Stella has been kidnapped. - [Man] I beg your pardon sir, hello sir? (foreboding music) (doorbell buzzing) - Good afternoon, Madam. - Oh, no it's sir actually. - [Left Man] Ha ha ha, the gas metre gov, oh it's all right sir, I know where it is, thank you. - Larry? - Yes? - No I'm looking for Lauren's Frisbee. - Well that's right? - I'll do it. - I'll do it! I'm in charge and that's final. - I don't know where the metre is. - Oh I'll find it, gov. - Look don't leave me on me own with... - Oh sorry about this woman's dressing gown, I mean I don't usually walk around with... - Well to each his own mate. - [Albert] Excuse me, I have to look up a telephone number. Likely in the Yellow Pages. - Ah there you are sir, thank you very much, sorry to disturb you. - That's all right. - Looking for a plumber mate? - No, no, no, I'm looking for an interpreter actually, Arab. - Arab interpretor, well there's a coincidence, let me make a recommendation sir, make a note of this. Yes, the Eastern Import Company sir, we use them all the time, don't we Chumley? - What for? - We do don't you remember? Here we are sir, Eastern Import Company, South Road. - South Road. - West-W-3. - West-W-3, thank you. - Thank you, sir. (frolicking music) - Here now. - Thank you. Now, take that off it's mine! Anyway this is our guest rag. - Who is? - Look this is no time to make speeches, plan 47B. - No! - Pink alert! - Really? - Blue tiles. - Is it that serious? - In my opinion. It's desperate, now I move, you bring him to me, and whatever you do, be forceful. - But it's not my turn! - Oh yes it is. I was forceful yesterday. - Were you, oh yeah, Thursday! Be forceful, be forceful, be forceful... Ah, welcome to our friendly store, you are? You're the wrong person. - Yes, I'm often being mistook. - I'm not surprised. Just be forceful, peanut, peanut, peanut, be forceful! - Excuse me! - Welcome to our friendly store, you are the millionth customer. - Just excuse me, yeah don't I know you? - No, no, don't think so. - Yeah, I thought you were on the gas? - I thought you were on the game, you sir, are our millionth customer, and the manager would be delighted if you'd come to his office, just up this way sir. - I was hoping to find someone who might translate something for me. - Uhm, anything you want sir, today, is your today! Eastern Import is at your disposal. - Yes? Ah splendid! - Our millionth customer. - Forgive me for not going out by I haven't quite finished. I'm sorry about this, it's a temporary office, but we find it such a convenience. And now sir, may I extend to you on behalf of the Eastern Import Company, our very warmest congratulations on being our millionth customer. - Oh, thank you very much sir I'm very proud sir. - Careful, he's easily flushed. - And may I say, sir, I'd like you to feel free, to take advantage of any of our specialised services you feel you may need. - Like translating? - Ah! - Oh I'm so sorry! Was that your foot? - Yes! - I had a pain in the neck. - Yeah well, actually I would like some information. - Anything. - Just name it. - I was hoping that somebody could translate this for me. (frolicking music) (speaking foreign language) - The Grange, Upper Woldingham. - Ah, Grange, Upper Woldingham. - Could I just check that sir, we don't want to make any mistakes doing, thank you. (door knocking) - Come on, come on hurry up. - That's probably our millionth and one customer, sir. (toilet flushing) - Well I'm quite satisfied, and you? - Sorry. - It's all right. - Sorry. - Saucebox! - Wait a minute I've lost it, who had it last? Oh excuse me-- - Don't worry sir, that translation is quite all right. - Sir can I have the book back now please. - Oh yes of course the book, give him the book. - I haven't got it. - Perhaps you left it in the office sir, why don't you go and get it. - No, no no you had it last. - I don't think so. - Yes you had it. I distinctly remember. - No I didn't. - It's in that pocket. - No it isn't. - Look! - Oh, it is. - That's right. - Thank you. - I think you ought to have a third opinion on this sir. Take it and get another opinion. - Oh right. - No, no, it's good. (muttering) Please let me have it! Where is he, oh there! - I think you'll find something here Madam, more to your liking, now? - Where's the book? - He's got it! - Oh right, oh no! - Yeah! (screaming) (anticipatory music) - Good Lord. - Chumley! Why did you let him get that book you birdbrain? - I got carried away you sparrow legs! - Oh come on let's get out of here. - I say, what on earth's going on here what are you doing with this carpet? - Ah well we'll offer it to you, 1,50 pound a yard, we're having a sale, good afternoon, we're carpet salesmen, our part makes your party. - Nice one sir! - It's not bad, what is it, 50 by 40? - 51 by 41 actually. - It's less usual. - It's more carpet. - Well in that case I think we might as well have it. Say have you got any more? - Yes, well would you like you one? - Carpets. - [Both] No, yes, no, no! (eerie music) - Harry switch that organ grinder off, I'm trying to think while I work out your commissions. See, Jim had a day out last week. And Louitius was fined for pimping. Bill-- (phone ringing) Hello, oh yes sir, yes tomorrow for sure. Six girls as we arranged. I don't remember saying anything about seven. It's not that, but listen I've got these ready in the cellar, six beauties. The best yet, oh you won't be disappointed. Oh there's no question of cancelling our deal, if you want seven you shall have them. I've never disappointed you yet have I, yes. And may Allah do the same on you. (frolicking music) Hello boys, hello girl, Harry can I have a word with you. Not you Desiree. I won't keep him long dear. Harry, something's cropped up, I'm afraid I must ask you to do something for me. I have a problem and, well you're the only person I can turn to. We've known each other a long time Harry and I know that you've always looked up to me as if I was a father. Why don't you sit down Harry, there's a draught in here, I'll close those French windows. (phone ringing) - Shall I answer that, guv? - Yes, but I'm not into anyone. No not that one, sit over there by the desk. - Yes, no we're not in. - Sit down. Harry, there comes in a time in every man's life, Harry, when he has to give up something he's fond of. Kings give up their countries, there was that bloke who went to the guillotine. What I'm asking you Harry is a far, far better thing than you have ever done before. What do you think of Desiree really, Harry? - She's all right, why? - They want her. And that's all there is too it, the decision has been made. I'd like to give you a little something, my way of thanks, Harry, how about a tenner? - Oh thank you very much Mr. Parks. - So it's all right then? - What is? - Giving up Desiree for tomorrow's consignment? - Of course it's all right. - It is? Well let's make it a fiver shall we, I'm a little short at the moment. - Thank you. - Is the van all right for the tomorrow? - Yes I've had a word with Jim, and he knows the tools are in the front because we don't want any more trouble like we had last time. So I've got the rest of the night with Desiree? (swanky music) - Oh Harry! (giggling) Oh Harry you're so impulsive. We are still going on holiday? - Sure. - It won't be too hot will it? - What one? - Where we're going. - Oh, well no, no. - Will it have those funny things on it? - What funny things? - You know. Coves and grottos! - Coves and grottos? Oh you mean the seaside. - I don't like all that sand and hot sun. - Would you miss me if I was to go away. - Of course, would you miss me? - I will. - I don't envy all those girls downstairs, you know, going on that long sea trip, oh, and those camels. - Well then, they get treated very well. - Are you gonna do it or am I? - Do what? - I have to strip every night with bright light in front of me, I'm not gonna stay in bed with you with the lights on! (frolicking music) - Well Harry and his good lady have retired to their room and I'll trust you'll do the same boys. - [Man] Thanks for the offer Mr. Parks, but I'm afraid it'll be a bit crowded. - That Louitius. (frolicking music) (chattering) - Spiritual power, love. And (mumbling) Clark Gable kisses (mumbling). And it fades out (mumbling). (frolicking music) (gasping) - Albert! (anticipatory music) (groaning) - Thank you, now untie them. (clock striking) (swanky music) (frolicking music) - [Fosdyke] There was no need to close the door Chumley. - I didn't close the door. - Don't argue with me. - [Chumley] I didn't. - Now go and see if he's around the corner. (frolicking music) Good evening. - Good evening. - [Both] We are with the Census Office in this area, and we have to inform you that are required by law! - Excuse me. - Granted, to-- - We can't both do it, can we? - No exactly! - [Both] To complete this official statement... - Excuse me. To complete this official statement as to the number of persons-- - In this habitation as of midnight, tonight. - Did you have to come at midnight? - Oh is it really that late? - No, it's mid-afternoon and there's an eclipse of the sun. - Really? - Come in. (frolicking music) There you are gentlemen, I'm sorry to hurry you, but I'm rather tired. - Well personally, I'm not surprised, oh. (frolicking music) (giggling) A very impressive list, Mr. Parks. - I'm so glad you think so, good night gentlemen. - Just think, all these famous people in this house here tonight. - What famous people? - Look, Miss A. Welsh. M. Brando. - Look, F. Flintstone! - [Both] Tom and... - My second sense tells me something. - What's that? - Things are not what they should be, Chummers. - Fozzy, I'll buy you a peanut. (frolicking music) (car horn honking) - Jim! Well don't just stand there, find out what it is. - What a funny way to adjust a mirror. What a funny way to adjust your dress. - What is it? - The horn is stuck Mr. Parks. - How was it stuck? - A bit of paper held it down. - Census paper? - What, no. It's the cover of some comic, (mumbling). - What have you got there? - Oh it's a pair of trousers. I found them by the van door. - Well I don't think they'll fit you Jim, but hold on them, the owner might turn up. I'll tell you what, get the shotgun and fire it out into the bushes, you never know what you might find. - Chumley? - Huh? - Hey, what if it's the law? - Oh forget it. It's probably Big Joe's mob again trying to get in on the act, like a bunch of school kids, never grow up. - Chumley? - Whoa, careful! Yeah what? - Come on! (laughing) - What's happened? - Haven't got any trousers on. (frolicking music) (groaning) (groaning) (ominous music) - That's a bit of a hangout isn't he, eh, 007? You should've stayed at home sonny, where you belong. Did you read your stars this morning? - Huh? - Did you? - No. - Did they tell you, you were going on a long journey? They should've done, ever heard of (mumbling)? - We can't send him Mr. Parks. - Why not? He'd make a lovely eunuch, come on, get out. Oh and you needn't think that I've forgotten about that book, Stella. Jim couldn't find it when he went back to your place. Blackmail, sorry sweetheart, you see, it isn't really mine. Perhaps the rightful owner can persuade you to tell us where you put it, tomorrow, pleasant dreams. (ominous music) - Oh Albert, you shouldnt've come on your own. - I'm sorry. - It's not that. Only I don't think there's much hope now. - Well I'll tell him I've got the book, it's in my trousers. - No, don't tell him. - Well why not? - Don't you understand, we're all being sold as entertainers to an Arabian oil state. - Entertainer, he didn't mean that bit about me being an eunuch did he? Well he's all right for you, I mean you'll have your singing and dancing and I'll, I'll have nothing. - Oh Albert! (anticipatory Eastern music) - Hold on a moment, Jim. - What? Here you are droopy drawers, these should fit you better than me. - Oh what a night, that were as we're never gonna see each other ever again. - It's a far, far better thing I do now, then I've ever done before. - Harry! - Okay take 'em away! - My public! My career! Harry you ruined me! - You can always make a comeback. - You nasty people, I won't forget this, you right bastards! - Well thanks son. Okay move off, get the car. - Okay. (anticipatory Eastern music) - I wonder where we're going. - Down to the coast, then all the way by sea I should think. - Oh no! - Why, what's the matter? - I always get seasick. - If I'd known I would've brought my seasick tablets. - Oh, don't worry, I'll try and get some on the boat. (frolicking music) - I'm sorry but my foot's my gone to sleep. - That's a change from your brain. Oh uh Miss Stella Lindsey? - Yeah, who are you. - I'm Fosdyke. This is Chumley. - Hey don't I know you two? - Yes, Albert Chumley. - Oh hello Albert Toddey. - How do you do, this is Mr. George Fosdyke. Mr. Albert Toddey. - Great pleasure, Mr. Toddey. Miss Stella Lindsey, Mr. Albert Toddey. Mr. Albert Toddey, Miss Stella Lindsey. Chumley, you already know. - Yes of course. - (mumbling) exchange cards? - Hand them one, Chumley. - Yes of course, pleasure. Peanut? - No, no, no the card. - Oh of course the card. Yes here we are. - Arthur Chumley, Home Office, Immigration Department. Something in pencil here, Gloria-- - Ah that's his. - Yeah in code. - Are you from Immigration? - No, no, no, we're Special Branch, The Investigators. - Are you going to rescue us? - Yes. - What's the plan? - Haven't the faintest idea. - I thought as much. Now you can forget about any rescuing until we get the man at the top. - I had two lines in Pull 'Em Down Gently Tomorrow. - Pull them down gently? - Tomorrow? - My first major movie. (frolicking music) - Headquarters could've picked up Dudley weeks ago. But that book proves that there's a bigger operator somewhere. - What are you talking about? - Oh I'm sorry Albert, I couldn't tell you before. But I'm a policewoman, a copper. - I thought you were a stripper! - Well she's a sort of stripping copper. - No, no, that sounds as if she strips coppers, she's a stripper copper. - You mean she cops strippers? - No no no, she copes with strippers, cops, crooks. - But she is a proper copper. - Yes. And considered the cropper this copper would've gotten if she's been caught quipping about, crikey. - Pardon? - You mean she's a proper copper, grieving about, coping with strippers and copping crooks. - Now will you listen all of you? I think that the top man is in this country. Have you seen the book? - No, but we read your report. - Accounts, all in Arabic. I think that Dudley finalises the deal before the shipment goes off, in which case we can catch the lot of them, together, now I suggest that you stay hidden in here. They will come and collect us, you can find out if there is a Mr. Big around, and then go and get help. Right, right? - Just to get back at Flash Harry. Do you know I had something big in front of me. - All right girls? Okay Albert? - Yes, except one thing. - Hmm? - Were you a copper before you were a stripper. Or were you a stripper who became a copper? - Ah we're here, hide, in the sacks. - Take her off that chain, Jim. Harry. - Yes sir? - Bring her into the office, we'll find out where that book is. (foreboding music) Sir there'll be a slight delay this month. There's a little matter we must attend to first. (frolicking music) Where is the book? - I don't know. (swanky music) - Harry! - Harry, see what he wants. - Oi, Harry! Yes you, come here! - What you want? - Come here. - Get out there and took a look for Harry. (anticipatory music) Put a stop to it now, Louitius. (anticipatory music) You have meddled once too often, Toddey! (gun fires) (frolicking music) - [Albert] Just tell the police I've left them hanging about. (frolicking music) - Stella, I abhor violence. That's why I'm going to walk away and leave you to our friend here, that is, if you don't start cooperating. (muttering) (music drowning out speech) - Harry, Harry! (groaning) - Harry for God's sake go and see what's happening. (mumbling) - What's happening? - I don't know. They keep knocking themselves out. - What should we do? - Well I'll tell you what. Get the rest of the girls here and take these fellows back to the van and put them on the chain, there's one around the corner, it's your boyfriend actually. - Fantastic! - Here have you see Chusdyke and Fumbley? - No I didn't actually wonder. - Right, go on. (frolicking music) - I wonder where they are? - Here in my pocket. - What? - My peanuts. Would you care for one? - What do you think I am? A bloody squirrel? Right, fall out. - Pardon? - Fall out. - Very well. - I sentry guard here and you take a roving patrol, roger? - And out! - Right, I'll finish this once and for all. (anticipatory music) - Albert! (screaming) (screaming) (rumbling) - [Albert] I really don't think this is a very good idea. - The keys to the handcuffs. - [Albert] I don't know why it has to be, why can't you-- - Just keep them occupied, and remember, Dudley's got a gun! - Ah good, I could use some help. (coughing) (speaking foreign language) Are you all right? (coughing) (speaking foreign language) - What? - (mumbling) that way (mumbling). - You're probably right. - Oh yes I know I'm right. (rumbling) (screaming) - Albert, there you are! - Whoa! (frolicking music) - Yes, yes, immediately please. Inspector Randall? (frolicking music) (screaming) - Well done. Say what kind of stroke is that? - Fatal I should think. You're not going to let him drown are you? - I couldn't if I wanted to, it's only three foot deep. He'll be all right when he stands up. Yeah you know I've been thinking. - Oh yes? - About a reward. - I'm afraid virtue has to be its own reward in a case like this. - No no I wasn't thinking about money, I was thinking about something a little more substantial. (laughing) I was thinking about that you might be able to fix me up with some sort of employment. (laughing) Now I'm sure you'd be able to fix me up, especially if I told your chief how you've been handling this job. - Peanut? - No thanks. I'm trying to give 'em up. - I will, thanks. Hmm, thanks. (anticipatory music) Yes all right well you leave it with me. Okay, oh and Miss Fielding, is there any chance of a cup of coffee down here, thank you. - [Albert Voiceover] And that is how a young man with ideas and imagination came to be in the service of Her Majesty. The grateful government bestowed on me a just reward. Nice really, recognition of my selfless valour. Outstanding courage and ingenuity. Plus an ability to keep me mouth shut of course. - Morning Albert. - Oh good morning Stella. - Thanks for looking after Mister. - That's all right. - You really are SuperAlbert. (cheerful music)
