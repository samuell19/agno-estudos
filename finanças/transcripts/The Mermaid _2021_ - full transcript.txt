Come on. Come here. Come on. Come to me. Run! I found it. That's them! The mermaids. Yang Fan. I've spent thirty years studying the mermaid. Today you finally proved their existence. Notify all units to prepare for action. Patriarch. What should we do? Yeah. What should we do? What should we do? This is enough. When they wake up, they will forget all the memories of the mermaids. The boats will drift back to their port by the tide. Contact with humans will only threaten the safety of our home in the ocean. What's going on? What's wrong? Get out of the way! Come on. Come on. Hurry up! Quick! Hold the fire. Change to tranquilizer guns. Let's go. Come with me. Get over there. Come on. Yes, sir. Mengmei! All members, withdraw. Hurry up. Come on. Come on. Mom, Mom... My love, you woke up. Who are you? Where am I? Welcome to my humble home. Where's my clothes? Your clothes were all soaked wet. You might catch a cold. So I took them off for you. This is your clothes. You're welcome. Don't mention it. Your fever has gone. Fever? You were running a fever all night. I fed you medicine mouth-to-mouth to reduce your fever. Thanks a lot. Since you woke up and are fine now, let's make something clear. My name is Xiaoyu. I'm your future wife. From now on you can only love me. You need to pamper me and you can't lie to me. Keep all your promises to me. You need to mean it in every vow you make. When others bully me, Come out and help me as soon as possible. When I am happy... Stop. What are you talking about? A girl like me with a pretty face and a perfect body. I want to marry you and I won't ask you for a bride price. You think I am not good enough for you? You're crazy. We already... We already had kisses! We had mouth-to-mouth... Don't talk nonsense! I didn't kiss you! I don't care! I don't care! I don't care! I don't care! I read from a book that one needs to get married with the boy she kissed! I can't reason with you. You are simply unreasonable. Let go. Come back. Come back! Come back here! Who are you guys? Let go of me! Patriarch, he's here. This is the will of God that Xiaoyu saved you who fell into the water. According to the rules of our clan, the two of you must get married right away. If anyone disagrees, we will... Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Let's exchange tokens of love. I solemnly declare that from today on you are my husband. Patriarch. Good acting. God. Tell me where to go! There. What are you doing here? We are married. Don't tell me you wanna leave without me. Married? I was forced to get married! I don't know you at all. It's not too late to get to know me now. What did the book say? Love can be cultivated over time. What do you want exactly? I saved your life. And you were sent by God to help me leave the island. This is destined. So don't you even try to ditch me. Understand? Set sail! Is this our future home? Don't touch it. You can speak alien's language? Thanks. I'll take the bedroom and you sleep in the living room tonight. Let me think about what to do with you when we wake up tomorrow morning. What to do with me? But... But we are married. According to our rules, if you don't want me, I'll become a girl no one wants. Don't kick me out. You... Hey, don't cry. Then I will take it as that you've promised me. Before going to bed, can I take a bath? Sure. Xiaoyu. Why did you save him from water? He was the one who led people to capture Mengmei. Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Revenge for Mengmei! We can't kill him now. Patriarch, this human's name is Yang Fan. The chief researcher of the Institute of Oceanography. Maybe we can use him to rescue Mengmei. You think he will trust us? Humans are selfish and cunning, and they wouldn't even save another human's life. How can he trust us? So neither will work. What should we do now? That's right. What should we do? I have an idea. This book said that all men like beautiful women, without exception. Just find a pretty female mermaid who's very good at walking ashore and proficient in human's romantic relationship psychology. Then she will let him trust her. Who do you think is the best candidate? Stand at attention! Line up. You little chubby fish. You snatch other fish's food every time. Don't feed them too much. What are you doing? The book says that eating like this can help bonding. Who is this boy? So cute. I said don't touch my things. Which part of it don't you understand? I'm off to work. You're going to work? Then I'll be waiting for you to come back at home. Look, this proposal still needs further change. Okay. Yang... No way! Yang Fan. I knew you are alive. Let's go. Get back to work. Are you injured? Hey, you finally came back. I was so worried about you. After you fell into the water that day, we sent people everywhere to look for you, but they didn't find you. I am so glad that you're back. I thought you didn't know how to swim. I was pushed by the waves onto a nearby island. An aboriginal girl on the island saved my life. There are aboriginal people on the island? Later... It's a long story. Sure. Anyway, I am just glad that you're back. I will take you to see our mermaid. These devices... Yang Fan. This newly built laboratory including all the equipment is set up for the study of this mermaid. This is all your credit. Yang Fan, through the research on this mermaid, we found that mermaid's body contains a special toxin. I named it Jiao Toxin. This toxin can control humans and eliminate their memories. Through the research, I'm sure the mermaid's body has unlimited possibilities. This is the Jiao Toxin. We should devote ourselves to ecological balance. I hope I will still lead the research in the future. Sir. Are you questioning my professional competence? From the data report, you've placed too much emphasis on the extraction and analysis of Jiao Toxin. Do you know how valuable the Jiao Toxin's genes are? They may even change humanity's ideas of existing genes. You are too eager for quick success. We are researchers. Extracting more Jiao Toxin than they can handle will only harm the mermaids and affect the ecosystem. This is not our original intention. I've spent so much time on this report... Okay. Stop it. Zuo Shan, since Yang Fan is back, he is still the leader for the future research. Alright? Yang Fan. We're counting on you to improve marine ecology. Xiaoyu? I'll be waiting for you to come back at home. Hello, did you see a girl? She's wearing a men's shirt and about this tall. No. Hello, did you see a girl... No. About this tall in a men's shirt? This girl is so drunk! Come on, hottie. Drink all the booze. And I'll take you to find him. Come on. I finally found you. I thought I would never see you again. Why are you drinking? I got lost. These good gentlemen said they would take me to find you as long as I drank the wine. Buddy, she is your chick? A grown-up girl like she still got lost? Is she retarded? What? What are you looking at? Forget it. Come on. Forget it. Let's go, bro. Forget it. Are you injured? Are you hurt? Are you an idiot? You got lost. And you are a big girl yet you let them cheat you into drinking so much alcohol. Am I an idiot? Don't leave me alone at home ever again! You see, this city is so big with so many people. They are all looking at me! I... I really want to go home. When you need to contact me, just use this to call me. I don't want to! Can you take me to your office tomorrow? If I want to find you, I won't get lost again. Please? Please! Alright! It's late. You sleep in the bedroom tonight, and I'll sleep on the sofa. Get up, get up. Go out with me. Are we going to work? Since I will take you to where I work, I need to dress you up beautifully. Office? Is this where you work? Yes. Dr. Yang. Hello. You guys go without me. Sure. Dr. Yang, the experiment over there is about to start. I see. Just go ahead. I can go home by myself. Okay, I gotta go. Yang Fan. What's your relationship with that girl who came here today? It's been only one day. How did she become like this? It's just some experiment. Why do you care about a fish? She is a mermaid, a new species. We spent so much time finding her. We should protect her rather than abuse her. Call the doctor. Her life will be threatened if this continues. Call the doctor and disclose the secret of the mermaid to the public? The new species is likely to destroy the marine ecology. So a comprehensive research is necessary. Yang Fan. Our research is now in a critical period. Some things are on a need-to-know basis. I hope you can understand. But she will die if this continues! Last night we had another new discovery. Zuo Shan. The lower body of the mermaid is very peculiar. After they go ashore, their tail will automatically change into two human legs. This should be an ability they developed to adapt to survival on land. Unbelievable, right? Yesterday we did an experiment on this mermaid. But this ability has a fatal flaw. As you can see, just pour such a small glass of water on her legs, and they will become like this. Yang Fan. Our research plan has reached the technological critical stage. Our priority next is the confidentiality. Do you understand? Yang Fan, here you are. Get out. Sir, I'll take her out now. - Let her come in. - I'm looking for the bathroom. Sir. Is this a mermaid? You also know about mermaid? I read it in fairy tales. Yang Fan. Is this the girl who saved your life? Yes. Mengmei... What did they do to you? Stop! There're so many people here. You will be in danger. This girl's background is unknown. So you must investigate her. Who are you? Where am I? Welcome to my humble home. From today on you are my husband. Just go! Are you okay? This mermaid is so fierce. Sir, excuse us. Notify Zuo Shan. Speed up the research of the new drug. Also, launch plan B. Yes, sir. Maybe I'll try this. Xiaoyu. Xiaoyu. I'll go there and have a look. Okay. Ankang? Since when were you able to become a real fish? What are you looking at? Patriarch asked me to ask you when the action will start. Wait for me downstairs tonight. In this bottle is a special Jiao Potion I invented. It can make people hallucinate. Dinner time. This girl's background is unknown. So you must investigate her. Sorry. I'm so clumsy. It's okay. Patriarch. The Mermaid Pearl is the treasure of the mermaid clan. Are you sure you want to give it to me? It can prevent your legs from turning back to a fish tail after they get wet. And it can also make wounds heal quickly. Let's clink glasses. Sure. Thank you for saving my life. Thank you. You're most welcome. Why hasn't she come downstairs yet? I always wanted to ask you a question. The woman on that photo, is that your mother? Where is the other half of the photo? That's my dad. What happened to you guys? While I was growing up, my dad had been busy with work. He didn't even make it to the hospital when my mom was dying. Then he had a car accident and has been in a coma since then. Never mind. Enough about me. How about you? Where is your family? I... I was brought up by my sister when I was a child. She was like my mother. But when we put out to sea a few days ago, she went missing. I don't know if I can see her again. You can do it. You can definitely find your sister. Your father will get better, too. This is strange. Why do I feel so dizzy? Hello, sir. I'm sorry, I overslept. I'll be there right away. No need. I just called to inform you that the institute is closed for some construction today. Just take the day off today. - My goodness. - Construction? Why would I fall asleep? It's so sudden. You okay? Do you have a headache? Why is your face so blushed? You have a fever? I'm fine. Let's go out and have fun today. You okay? I am fine. I need to use the bathroom. Is your stomach upset? I'll go with you. It's okay. I just drank too much water. Can you hold this for me? Sure. What were you doing last night? Something went wrong with our plan. When will we take action exactly? Give me some more time. I haven't got his access card yet. Why would you even bother? I can knock him out with my hammer. No, what if you kill him? You're right. So what if he die? Did you forget that it was him who shot Mengmei? Patriarch said that I will be responsible for this. I will definitely get Mengmei out. Xiaoyu, don't tell me you really fell in love with him. How can it be possible? It's just acting. A glass of juice, please. There will be an open-mic night here in a while. Why did you want to catch the mermaid? Studying mermaids is to better protect the ocean. This covers multiple aspects such as evolution, biology, and anthropology. Studying mermaids is my life goal. I don't know what this research is. But for your research, you guys lock another life up. Is it really worth it? We just lock her up for the safety's sake. Because she is an unknown species and we don't know anything about her safety factor. But if you don't catch mermaids, they won't hurt you at all! Mankind has developed so rapidly because of our exploration and research on the unknown. This is an established fact and you can't deny this. For your research, you did not hesitate to lock up another life and you guys are even hurting her. Does it make you happy? It doesn't matter if I am happy or not or Even what my feeling is. This is science and science must be rigorous with a clear purpose. What else is in your life other than science? What happened to you today? Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Royal Love Music Restaurant. I am Colin, your host tonight. Today's rule is everyone can come to the stage for a karaoke competition. Okay, this beautiful lady! Please come on stage. What are you doing? Come on. Which song Do you want to sing tonight? Seaside. Okay. Seaside. Can I ask you why you chose to sing this song? Because I want to. Really a beautiful woman with a strong personality. Come on. Music! From today on you are my husband. Married? I was forced to get married! I don't know you at all. These good gentlemen said they would take me to find you as long as I drank the wine. Don't tell me you really fell in love with him. How can it be possible? Are you okay? I'm fine. Let me hold it for you. Hey! What's that for? I need a clear purpose for stepping on your toes? I come here all the time. But today is the first time there's someone by my side. This was my mother's favorite bracelet when she was alive. It's also my most precious thing. I want to give it to you. Such a precious thing. You want to give it to me? Why? If I have to have a clear purpose... I think it's because I've fallen in love with you. Come on. I will put it on for you. Off you go! What are you doing? Why was he grabbing your hand? You were exposed! He found out! Fortunately, I came just in time. Ankang, you... Don't worry. This hammer is specially processed. He won't die. What's going on? Hurry up! They're over there! - Xiaoyu! - Ankang! Run! Hello, sir? Come to the institute now. Something went wrong. What's wrong? Patriarch, we were ambushed. Ankang tried to save me and was caught by them. I knew it would end up like this. Greedy humans are constantly destroying our homes. Now they even want to kill our members. I'll think of another solution. Maybe we can... This is all your fault. You have to understand, with every passing day, the lives of Mengmei and Ankang are in danger. Now that we have found out the position, let us use our own way to solve the problem! But they are... Say no more! Humans and us cannot coexist after all. Stop contacting that human. I will never let my people continue to suffer from mankind! Sir, is this the construction upgrade you mentioned? Luckily I kept the plan B. Don't think I don't know that your accomplice is the mermaid, right? Will you start talking or not? What are you doing? Yang Fan. It's necessary. But sir. Okay, I'll let you see what we found. See for yourself. This is impossible. I deliberately splashed water on Xiaoyu's legs and they didn't become a fishtail. It's just a coincidence. I wish this is a coincidence. But mermaids have natural abilities. What they are capable of is still in the early stage of research. We haven't fully understood them yet. But she stayed with me all day. One person cannot appear in two places at the same time. Yang Fan. You are my most proud disciple. I also want to believe your words. But I have my responsibility to everyone in this project, too. In order to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding, bring your girlfriend here tomorrow and we will do a basic test. The truth will be clear at a glance by then. Sir. Okay, that's settled then. While I still trust you, cherish it. You're back. I have something to talk to you. Hello? Hello, is that Mr. Yang? Your father Yang Wei's condition is very unstable today. You should come to the hospital as soon as possible. Okay, I'm on my way. Go to the hospital with me, will you? Sure. The surgery is very risky and expensive. You are the only next of kin of the patient. So we'll need you to make a decision as soon as possible. You better give me a reply in ten minutes. As soon as possible. Okay. What did you do to my dad? Dad! Dad! Fan, is that you? Yes, it's me! I'm so glad you're back. Go to the hospital. Yes, sir. Hurry up! It's dangerous here! Xiaoyu! Have you heard of the story of a guardian and a mermaid? Legend has it that people believed mermaids were evil sirens whose singing would lure the passing ships sail into dangerous waters. And the duty of the lighthouse guardian is to protect the passing ships. The guardian tried every means to catch the so-called sirens. Finally he found the trace of those sirens. But when the guardian tried to catch them, he accidentally fell into the sea. The guardian woke up to find out that it was the mermaids who saved him. Mermaids are simple and kind by nature. They've been using their beautiful singing to guide direction for the lost ships. But they were misunderstood by people who considered them as evil sirens in water. The guardian and the mermaid fell in love. They agreed they would never leave each other and they would stay together for life no matter what happened. You are a mermaid, aren't you? Don't you think the two people in the story are just like us? You approached me to save your people, right? Since you already know, why would you still ask me? If the two people who were once hostile could be together in the end, why can't we? I don't care why you approached me at first. I just want to make sure one thing. The girl I love, is she the real side of you or is she a persona you created to get close to me? I... Xiaoyu, what are you doing? I told you to stop contacting this human! Of course I've never really liked you. I just did it to use you and deceive you. Is it just a lie that you rescued me from the water? Is it a lie that you saved my dad? Are all the things happening these days just a lie? It's to win your trust. So that I could better take advantage of you! Do you understand now? I don't believe you. You obviously love me. Why don't you want to admit it? Listen. Humans and mermaids have always been natural enemies. We can't be together. This is what I wanna tell you today. From now on we are the enemies. Xiaoyu! Do you know what you are doing? Yang Fan, you want to ruin our plan, huh? Just for that girl? Are you silly? I can let him live. But you have to keep our promise and never see that human again. Go. Hurry up. I didn't expect you to have the nerve to come here again. I want to see Xiaoyu. I have something to tell her. Where do you think this place is? I can kill you now. Patriarch. There's nothing to be said anymore. After we parted that day, I went back and thought for a long time. You are right. I don't deserve your love. But there is one thing you were wrong about. Humans and mermaids are not natural enemies. I am here today for only one purpose which is to make up for the mistakes I made in the past. I want to help you to rescue your people. Why should we believe you? This is Wang Li's retina chip. With it, you can open the gate of the laboratory to get them out. But it is not enough to do the job just by myself. I need your help. So this is your proof? Maybe you're trying to catch all of us at once. I trust him. I didn't expect these mermaids to actually believe you. They're indeed inferior creatures. Inferior creatures should surrender to the superior creatures. Yang Fan. Nice job. Our research results and discoveries will definitely shock the world. Yang Fan, I shouldn't have trusted you! This one will be used for anatomy! What? Yang Fan... We've gone astray on this direction. Just let it stop here and now. The Jiao Toxin! Sorry, sir. You... Why would you betray me? Why? You are so ungrateful. Maybe this is the best ending. Zuo Shan? What are you doing? Don't come over. Calm down. Yang Fan, you were his favorite student and my fellow senior who I respected the most. But you, you betrayed me and our teacher to fall in love with a mermaid! You can do whatever you want to do to me. Don't hurt her. Yang Fan. It seems that you've never fallen in love with me. Xiaoyu! Are you okay? I'm fine. Let's go. Mengmei! Mengmei! Yang Fan. Go. None of you can leave this lab! It's Jiao Potion. This is the source of my strength. It took me so long and spent hundreds of millions on it! You think I just wanna caught you for research? You are so naïve. I want all of you to die! Yang Fan! Patriarch... It's all your fault! You seduced my student, so he betrayed me! I will cut your face and you won't be able to seduce any men again! By the way, I heard the cry of a mermaid is the most beautiful sound in the world. Cry! I said, cry! Let go of her. Y... Yang Fan. Let go of me! Yang Fan, wake up. Yang Fan, look at me! I am Xiaoyu. Why are you crying? Don't cry. I'm fine. For what you said to me the other day, did you lie to me when you said you never loved me? Yes. I lied to you. What a pity. I have a lot of things that I want to do with you. You will be fine. You will get better. I will always be with you. You... I am so sleepy. Don't fall asleep! Wake up! Yang Fan! Yang Fan, wake up. Yang Fan, stay with me! Xiaoyu. Forcibly activating the Mermaid Pearl will cause your body great harm. We will also be affected. From now on you will never be in human's form. Even if you save him, he will also lose his memory and forget about everything about you forever. It's okay. I will remember him, and that's enough. Xiaoyu... Fan. You woke up. Dad. Dad. Why am I here? You were ill. But you'll be fine now that you woke up. Recently, Wang Li, a well-known biologist and the Chairman of Harley Pharmaceutical Factory was investigated and has been prosecuted for multiple charges including damages to the marine ecological environment. The defense lawyer argued with Wang Li's mental abnormality to suspend all trials for the time being... I can't remember anything. There are things better not to remember. It's like a dream. You have so much emotions in the dream but when you wake up, you can remember nothing. The harder I tried to recollect it, the more empty I felt. Then my father told me that I developed a new habit which is I had to come to the beach every day to take a walk. If you ask me why, I don't know, either. I will find myself here before I even realize it.
