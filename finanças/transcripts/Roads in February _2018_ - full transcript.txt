ROADS IN FEBRUARY -Hello. -Hello. -Can I ask you something? -What's up? Is anyone going to Espinillo today? Maybe Marconi. What time? Around six. And if he doesn't? If he doesn't today, he'll go tomorrow. Isn't there a number where I can reach him? I don't have one for him. He's not a cell phone kind of guy. Your best bet is to wait here. He'll probably pass by. Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. You have family in Espinillo? Yeah. My grandma. She'll be happy to see you! Who is she? Magdalena Mihovich. Doña Magda! You know her? Of course. How is she? I couldn't really say. I haven't been out to Espinillo for a while. There's not much demand to go there! Where do you live? Canada. Canada! That's great. You like it? Sure. Life is good there, isn't it? Yeah. You haven't been back for a long time? It's been quite a while. I'll be right back. Grandma? Grandma! Who's there? Sarita! What a surprise! When did you get here? Come in! -There you are, dear. -Thanks. -There you go. -Thanks, Grandma. You're welcome. Let me help. It's so hot! Well, it's February... Sorry. What a treat! You rest now. Is Doña Magda there? -Have you eaten? -No. Eat. Olga was looking for you earlier. -Did she bring the paper? -No. I think she didn't recognize me. She's not all together up there. What happened there? Where? Here? What happened to you? No, that's the style! If you want to take a shower, I turned on the water heater. Sarita. Let’s show Grandma what we brought her. Grandma! Don't you like the chicken? Yes, I like it. How are you doing, Grandma? I wasn't expecting you. I told you I was coming. I tried to call when I got into Montevideo. There was no answer. Maybe I was out. I was worried. Here I am. You don't want to talk about Dad? What happened? He wasn't doing well. Did you see him? He never came back. Things didn't turn out the way he wanted them. He was ashamed? My dear son. I'd have given anything to see him again. Use a bowl! Don't they use bowls in Canada? I brought you that. You shouldn't have. Your visit is enough. You like it? It's beautiful! Thank you, dear. Let me take a picture. I'm old and ugly. I don't want a picture. Come on, please? For a souvenir. I don't want to. I have photos of myself that I can give you, if you want. It's not the same. Thanks, it's very beautiful. Magda! Are you there? -Come in! -All right. You don't have to do that, Magda! Sarita! Welcome back! How are you, Olga? I'm doing well. I have to keep an eye on my pressure, as usual, but we're all doing fine, thank God. Can you get me the newspaper from the kitchen, please? There's a nice breeze here. It's winter over there. Winter? How come? Because it's up north. But we're right here. She says it's 20 degrees below zero. 20 degrees below zero? -And people go out? -Of course, they do everything. How is Silvia? She's doing very good. She got married. She got married? A good match. Her husband is a dentist. They have the cutest little baby! -She still lives in Leones? -Of course. -What about you? Got a boyfriend? -No. All in good time. Silvia would love to see you. She'll be very happy to hear that you're in town. -Well, I'll leave you alone. -No, stay! I have to go make dinner. You know how it is. I'll come by later. I'll come with you. How's your mother? She's good, thank you. That's great. That mountain, why is it all alone? I don't know, that's just how it is. I don't want to leave. What happened to my little adventurer? This is your mom and dad's dream. Hello beautiful... I'll come back next week and finish this up. What do you mean, next week? You said it would only take an hour. It's more complicated than I thought. I have to replace a part. I'll buy it in Leones on Tuesday. How long have I been asking you to repair this damn pipe? And now I'm still waiting! I've been busy, Doña Magda. You really shouldn't worry about it. The rubber will hold. That's what you think! And it's full of mold, too. I'll fix it for you, don't worry. Magda, you have a guest? Yes, Sarita is here. What a pleasure, after so many years! What are you doing with her? Nothing. She just sleeps all the time. She must be tired from the long trip. -Claudio's wife didn't come? -No, they're separated. -Hello! -Hello. You look beautiful! How was mass? Fine, as always. Not many people. Are you hungry? No, sweetie. I'll just have a bit of maté. Fifty, as always. Thank you. Can I help you? Do you know what kind of sweetbread Doña Magda buys? Normally, she takes that one. And that one? It's moister. A different price range. -Okay, thanks. -No problem. I'll buy it myself. Because if I wait for you to do it, I'll be waiting another year, or what? No, you promised me... Did you find everything? Who were you talking to? Carlitos. To find out when he's going to come and finish the job. That thing outside? The pipe! Did you see the mess he left behind? This isn't the right one. I know, but it looks good, doesn't it? Didn't they have the other kind? Yes, but I thought that we could... No, this one is expensive! Don't worry, I'm the one who paid for it! Have you ever tried this one? How much did you pay for it? It looks so good, like it's home-made. But I like the other one! Why did you pay so much? I wanted to give you a treat. -Hello! -Hello. Does Carlitos the plumber live in this direction? That guy is not a plumber! But he lives on 8th Street, right? Keep going this way. The first street you cross is 8th Street, turn right there. I don't know the number, but the front is painted pink. You'll recognize it. -Thanks. -You're welcome. By the way, is there anything to smoke around here? -No idea. -No. Hello! Is your dad here? Renzo! Call Dad! Dad, a lady is here looking for you. Hello. I'm Carlitos. Nice to meet you. I'm Sara. I'm sorry to bother you. No, you're not bothering me at all. About the pipe... The pipe! Doña Magda thinks I've forgotten. No, it's just that I'm going to Leones tomorrow. I can pick up the missing part. Can you bring me something to write with, please? You're Claudio's daughter? I'm sorry for your loss. I knew your father, he was a good man. Go to the hardware store and ask for an elbow pipe fitting. It's this part. It attaches the pipe from the bottom to the one above from the sink. You have to ask for a quarter-inch PVC elbow. Got it? Go to Rita's Hardware. In the downtown area. You know it? Yes. There you go. -It's cold where you live? -Yes. -Very cold? -Yes. Okay, thanks. No problem, I'm here to help. You've had that one for a long time. True. It's lasted. You don't find clothes like this anymore. Made to last. Nowadays, people buy things to throw them away. True. Do you work? Of course. What do you do? I'm a barmaid. A waitress. And you make enough to live on? Yes. And your acting? That's over. I don't have the talent. Who told you that? That was a long time ago. You're talking like an old lady! Talent comes to those who work long and hard. You think I'm lazy. No. Yes. Dad thought that, too. Nothing I did was worth anything to him. A father wants what's best for his daughter. He didn't understand me. If you have a dream, Sara, you have to fight for it. Or you'll have regrets later. I don't know much, but I know that. I never finished school. Do you have regrets? Yes, I do. Sara! Don't you want supper? No, I'll eat later. Silvia. Sara! -How are you? -What are you doing here? I came to see Magda. It's been so long! You look amazing! Thanks. Beto! Do you remember Sara? She's Doña Magda's granddaughter. Hello. -This little one is yours? -Yes. Lulu! Look, this is my friend, Sara. We're a little late... Yes, we have an appointment for his vaccination. Maybe you could come back later? Yes. How long are you in Leones for? I’m not going back right away. I don't know. Great, we'll be back in about an hour and a half. Okay, great. I'll make time. So we'll see you here later. -What a pleasure! -For sure. -Let's go! -Okay, see you later. What a pity! What's the point of moving to another country just to work as a waitress? And with all the opportunities over there. What a waste! It’s because she didn’t finish school. She never finishes what she starts. It's like she has no ambition. Okay, but she's young. She still has time. What a disappointment for her father! Claudio was so brilliant. Apparently he wanted to come see me. He had his ticket and everything. But then he got sick. This sweetbread is really good. -Where did you buy it? -I don't know. Very good. Lots of fruit in it. Normally, there's not so much. Very tasty. Hello! Hello. Weren't you at the hardware store earlier? Yes. You're not from around here. Where are you from? It's a little complicated. Complicated? You're a photographer? Yes. You like taking pictures. Do you like photography? No, I'm not into photography. I'm into motorcycles. You've got a nice one. Yes, I've had it for a long time. What are you doing here? I came to buy a piece of pipe. A pipe? For what? For my grandma. Your grandma? Good. Bored? Yes. Me too. Here you go. Thanks. I'll be right back. -What do you think of this place? -It's great. Trains don't come here anymore? No, it’s abandoned. I like coming here. The beer will get warm fast. Want some? And you live off taking photos? I don't make a lot of money but I like what I do. Of course. Around here, no one likes their work, and we can't make ends meet anyway. What do you do? I'm saving up money to go to Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires? And what will you do there? I want to be a manager for a band. Everyone wants to go somewhere else. Give me five minutes. Want to go jump in a pool? A pool? A fancy pool for rich people. I don't have my swimsuit. Me neither. We can swim in our shorts. The water's delicious in the evening. Then you go home. Let's go. You know someone who lives here? Something like that. What's up, Julio? This is Sarah. She lives in Canada and she's a photographer. Hi. Julio works here, he's the security guard. The owners aren't here? Not right now. Hi, Barbie. Hi, Tincho. This is a friend of mine, Sara. She lives in Canada and she's a photographer. -Hello. -Hi, Sara. Got any weed left? Yes. Give me some. Here, you can pay me later. Thanks. You ready? -Feels good. -Yeah! Going already? Yeah. You're sure you know the way back? Yeah. Are you hungry? We could go eat something. No. You sure? It was really fun, but my grandma's expecting me. Just stay a little longer. No? We'll have a drink, something to eat, and then you go back. I can't. I have no more cigarettes. Take mine. I'll have one. Okay. I'll walk with you. My camera. It's not here! -What? -It's gone. I left it in my bag. -Are you sure that... -My camera's not here! Maybe it fell. Give it back! I don't have it! What do you mean? It was right here. I didn't see it! -What about him? -Who? That guy, I don't know... Julio! What's up? She says she can't find her camera. So what? I left it here. She left it in her bag. Have you seen it? I haven't seen it. I have nothing to do with it! We were in the pool, and you... Wouldn't you have seen it? Get out of here. This girl is drunk. No, I'm not drunk! Please, my camera! It was there, I know it was! Get out of here! At least the memory card! Okay, I don't care about the camera, but I want the card from inside. What card? My photos! The card please! I don't have your card or your camera. Get out of here! Okay, I'm going to look for it myself. You're not going anywhere. Get out! Come on, don't do this to me! Do what to you? We've known each other for a long time. And you brought this crazy girl who's accusing me of stealing! Have I ever stolen anything from you? She's drunk. Get out of here. Open up! Open up! At least give me the card. What card? I don't have anything! Wait, Sara! Grandma. What happened? Nothing, I was delayed. I'm sorry. Where were you? I should have called you. I'm sorry. I thought something happened to you. I called Silvia. No, everything is all right. Don't worry. You don't get it, do you? You only think of yourself! I told you I was sorry! I don't need anyone adding to my worries! It's not my fault that your son never came home. Go back to sleep, Grandma. It's very early. You're leaving soon. We still have a few days. Rest now. Let me have a look. This one. Your toenail is ingrown. It hurts. It hurts a lot. Sorry. Thank you. You're kind. It's nothing. All done. Do you have someone to help you? Usually Vilma, the hairdresser, takes care of my feet. But she went to help her daughter who just had a baby. So she couldn't come. What happened to the little bells that used to be outside? A storm ended up breaking them. Remember when we brought them with my dad? Of course. You were very little.
