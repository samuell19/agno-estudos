Three inocent girls will die at dawn. A new planet will appear out of nowhere... and it will devour the Sun's light. This will be the Coronation day. And so... LAMAASTHU WILL RULE. What are you doing here? Nothing, I was changing, I'm going home. Home? It's not even 3 o'clock. Shouldn't you be dancing now? I don't feel so good. You look fucking hot to me. I left home just to see you dance, to see that squat thing... Really, Moro, I'm outta here. I'll dance for you tomorrow, okay? I promise. You promised. I promise. What have you got there? What? What's in the bag? My clothes. Why? Your clothes. You didn't change, you're the same as before. Like I wouldn't notice with you in that. Come on. Come on. Open it up. Open it up. Bitch! Fucking hell! Fucking bitch! Come on. The number you have called has been turned off or... It's her. Alba, don't start. She is angry. Pack your things. We're leaving. Where are we going? I don't know, but we're going now. It's busy. Fuck! Olivia? What are you doing here? Do you know what time it is? You're leaving? Yes, we're leaving. But the party's tomorrow. - What party? - Her birthday. Sorry, honey, but we can't go. You're not coming? No, and go home, your auntie will be worried. Lucía? Who is it? What are you doing here? How did it happen? I don't know, Salinas. She must've had keys, she knew where... How could she have the key? She had them. I saw her with the bag, so I stopped her and then... Then she busts your head, a girl, how tall? How tall is she? It's not my fault, Salinas. They let her out. Does Arruza know? Not yet. If we get her first, he shouldn't find out. You're an idiot, Moro. He'll find out. Of course he'll find out. I stabbed her in the leg and her face is busted up. She can't have gone far. I messed her up, you should've seen her. It's their problem. They see a chick with a bloody face and stabbed in the thigh And they let her out. Then it's Moro's fault, right? Fuck that. We have the location. Fuck! Who did this to you, Lucía? I got in a jam. A jam you say? Brace yourself. Press on it. Breathe, that's it. That's it. Take out your hand. You have to let me stay. No. - Please. - No way. You can't stay here. I'll fix you up and you go. Mom. Alba! Go to your room and go to bed! Aren't we leaving now? No! I don't know. Rocío... I can't go. There is nothing back here. What a bitch. Listen to me. With the blood she's lost, she can't be far. Moro, don't bust my balls. What the fuck? What the hell is this, Lucía? It's not your fucking business. No, it's fucking not. I don't care what you do with your life. You can't turn up with this shit and put my daughter in danger. I'm sorry! You're sorry? Bullshit you're sorry! Take this walking drugstore of yours and go! If I go, they'll catch me. It's not my problem, Lucía. You stopped being my problem years ago. They're going to kill me! I DON'T CARE! Thanks. How did you find us? Mom gave me the address. Mom? Since when do you speak to Mom? I went to the hospital... to say goodbye. To say goodbye? You fucked up her life and in the last moment you have the nerve to turn up to see if you could fix it, right? What a bitch. She forgave me. She forgave you? Sure. And you know why? Because believe it or not mom never stopped loving you. Never! That's what being a mother is. What a shame. Where were you going in the middle of the night? What's wrong? You're not the only one with problems, that's what's wrong. Look, I know all this sucks, but it's done now. And it's a lot of money. What are you saying, Lucía? It's an opportunity. - And I'm with a guy in this, OK? - A guy! Fucking great! He knows how to sell it. Are you an asshole or what? Listen to me. With what we get we could buy Grandma's house. The three of us can go there. I'm sure it's better than this shit. That's true. Then let's fucking do it Think about the girl. You don't even know her. Hello. Hello. I made you some coffee. You drink coffee? OK. Thanks. Are you my auntie? Yes. I'm your auntie. My name's Alba. Alba. You're Lucía, aren't you? Is Mom still asleep? No, she's not here. She's not? I think she left during the night, her bag's not there. What's wrong? Rocío. Rocío. I told you. OK. Don't you know where she went? I don't know, she doesn't like this place, it scares her. Do you have a phone? Mom's mobile, but she'll have taken it. Doesn't a neighbor have a phone? There are hardly any neighbors. What are you staring at? Bewilderment increases among the experts, who cannot explain how a celestial body of this size suddenly appeared without prior detection. This mysterious object was first seen two days ago... Good morning. What a fuck-up, Salinas, what a fuck-up. It's all under control. We spread the word and people are shit-scared. You know the Chinese, right? The Usera crew. They're my partners. We do business together and they respect me. You know why? Because when they need me to send them a package, I always deliver on time, no trouble. They're happy. And now what? Since Amparo left the churro stall they're not as good. Did she retire? Yes, I think so, she was old. Then find her and tell her to come back to make my churros, I'll pay her. The girl hasn't got the knack. What's her name? Amparo, like her mother, I think. The slut, shit, the slut. Lucía, her name's Lucía. Lucía... the bringer of daylight. You know her? By sight. I spoke to her a few times, one of the platform girls. It's funny, I pay a load of morons to keep it all under control and some dancer comes and turns it all upside down. I wasn't there, they told me later. Well, I think our Lucía couldn't have done it alone. Someone tipped her off, I'd say. I'll... take care of it. I'll find her. I swear. But this is a big deal. That's why Calvo's here. You find Amparo and tell her to make my churros. Think you can do that? Good morning. Hello. Do you have a phone? I need to make a call. Make it quick. Thanks. Hi, this is Rocío. I can't talk to you right now. Guys, let's go find her. Nothing yet, nobody's seen her. Or so they say. Maybe it's true. There are too many blocks. This'll take a while, eh? Blood. What? The girl's. Something intimate of hers, panties or something. Get it for me. Jeez, this is whacko, man. Aren't you eating? Who were those men? Nobody. Were they the ones who hurt you? What? Last night, you had blood on you. Was it them? Is that why you're scared of them? Yes. Report it to the police, that's what you should do. Sure, but for now it's better to stay here. OK. What are you doing? Mom wants the gas off if we're not cooking. For safety. Sure. I don't cook much. You can tell, right? Mom says you're a dancer. Yes, well... something like that. You could teach me. What? How to dance. Sure, I'll teach you. But properly, professional. I love it. Alba, last night, why were you leaving? I told you, Mom's scared of this place. But why? Because of the woman upstairs. The apartment upstairs. Mom says no one lives there, but I know she's scared of her and it's why she left. And she leaves you here. That's not right. Why? You're here. You're my auntie, right? And who's this woman upstairs? The servant. The servant. Her lady's not here, so she's in charge now. But she says she'll come soon. I see... Why is mom scared of this servant? Cause she's scary. If you saw her, you would be too. She doesn't seem to scare you much. We're... friends. Sometimes she brings me presents... from space. Wanna see them? Weird presents for a girl, huh? Why? She says they're offerings, I like them. Tears. From children. Teeth. Alba, tell me the truth. Where'd you get all this? I told you, they're presents she brings me. She brings them... here? She brings them through dreams. She makes me dream ugly things, then she can get in here. She says that dreams are doors. What the fuck are you doing here? I need to talk to Lucía. Don't give me no shit. You live together, right? Maybe you know where she is. No idea, she didn't sleep at home. I know that. Has she called you? You know anything? No, she hasn't called me. Listen to me. Lucía's in big trouble and I just want... I just want to help. I don't want any trouble, OK? Of course you don't. But we're in big fucking trouble. So if you want to help her, tell me where she is. I don't know anything, I swear. Will you teach me now? How to dance. Later, OK? What are you looking at? Is it you? And Mom. And Grandma. You look happy. We were always happy. And not now? When you grow up, it's harder. Mom never tells me things about you. Because I haven't been a good sister. You seem good to me. Is that Mom? Let's go to the party. It's the neighbor, she won't go away. Party! Party! Who are you? She's my auntie. She's a dancer. Really. She can come too. It's her birthday. On the 5th floor. We'd better not, Alba. No? You're not coming? They have a phone. Party. Hello, honey. Hello, I'm Lucía, Alba's aunt. Come in, come in. Thanks. Isn't Rocío coming? No, she had to go out, I'm minding the girl. Great. Come, follow me. Marga, this is Lucía, Alba's auntie. Hello. Welcome. That must be Rosita. The blood certainly shows. You're just like the girl and her mother. All three just as pretty. Thank you. Gosh, here you all are. What a shindig you have here. Hello, I'm Lucía. Hello. You're so pretty, my God. And that skin. I really notice these things. And hair. Hair drives me crazy. Hi! Here's our star, 14 years old! Here. Gifts. Open it, open it. What will it be? Hurry up. Open it up. What will it be? Pepis! Great! It's so cute. I'm lovin it. To set up a beauty salon. You'll never be short of customers, guaranteed. Let's put on some music, come on! This place is like that. It is what it is. Go on, drink with me, don't make me look bad. We aren't exactly a crowd here. I suppose you noticed that. And before you know it, we're up to hi-jinks. Alba says there are hardly any neighbors. Well, it's not the Ritz. Everbody ends up leaving. Does anyone live in the attic? It's been empty... for almost 30 years. Bolted tight. It's better. Better... Better why? What are you afraid of, dear? What? It's in your eyes, and you can't hide that. I'm just a bit worried about my sister. I haven't heard from her since yesterday. Your sister keeps to herself. She'll be back. But she left the girl here? That's weird. Did you call her? No, I forgot my phone. I wanted to ask if I could call from here, if you don't mind. Sure, of course. Why would I mind? Hi, this is Rocío. I can't talk to you right now. Fuck! - Hello? - It's me. Fuck. Where are you? I fucked up. Moro caught me. I know. Relax. Just tell me where you are. You said it'd be easy. Listen, Lucía. They found your car. Calvo's looking for you... What? What the fuck, Victor. What the fuck! Listen, we're in this shit together, okay? You have to trust me. Honey, tell me where you are and I'll deal with it. Please, trust me. Okay. I'm in the Venus bui... Venus. What Venus? I can't hear you, you're breaking up. Where the fuck are you? What? Lucía... Fucking hell! The number you are calling does not exist. Jesus fucking Christ! The little lord. Aunt Galga. Her name's Lucía. Pretty. What do you want? The usual. To find her. Let's see what you've got. I'd better not ask. There. Are you sure? It's the same blood. The girl's there. But her name's not Lucía, It's Rocío. What do you mean? It's what I see. Be careful, little lord. How do you like Olivia? We got on badly before, now I like her. Mom says they're a bit crazy. Kind of, yes. Did you speak with mom? No. She didn't answer. It's very late, off to bed. Lucía. When she comes back, are you going? I don't know, I guess. You have to teach me how to dance, you promised. Tomorrow, go to sleep now. VENUS BUILDING, MADRID VENUS BUILDING, MADRID ZONE EXTENSION, SOUTH VILLAVERDE There you are. TEEN TAKES LIFE JUMPING FROM 4TH FLOOR WINDOW CANNIBALISM AND WITCHCRAFT VENUS BUILDING CASE. LOCALS FRIGHTENED VENUS. VILLAVERDE'S CURSED BUILDING THREE BODIES OF CHILDREN APPEAR IN VENUS BUILDING ON THE 10TH FLOOR. LAMAASTHU... FEMALE DEMON OF PAIN AND DESPAIR Lucía. Go to bed. It hurts. What have you got there? Nothing. What have you done, Alba? Give it. Fuck! Hold on. Hold it tight, don't let go. Are we going to the doctor? No. Don't look. Why did you do it, Alba? She told me to. I have to do what she says. That's enough! Lucía. You're her friends. You dance together... or whatever it is you do. We don't know her well, she goes her own way. Yes, we've seen that. We're watching the whole area, she'll come out, like rats do. And if she doesn't? What do we tell the Chinese? Will you talk to them? In Chinese? I don't come around here much, it's not my scene. If I'm here it's because we've got a big problem. I suppose you guessed that. And my patience is wearing thin. So if you have... anything to say... or you've been told something... or heard something... I'm all ears. If you don't want to talk... then... dance. Cause you do know how to dance, right? I've got all night. I've got her. Here, Venus Building. - Are you sure? - Almost. But I'm sure these showgirls will lend us a hand. I told you, we don't know anything. Rocío... Maybe that rings a bell. What are you on about? Come on! Who's Rocío?! I think she's her sister. Good! What are you doing here? Where the fuck were you? I told you, one night and you go. Are you crazy? Alba can't be left alone, you can't go like that. Alba is evil, that's why I left. What? She puts things in your head. That servant, her presents, she wants to drive you insane. Don't listen to her. You've still got time, do as I did. Get out of here. What are you saying? She's a girl. She's your daughter. Not anymore. Alba, go to your room! Alba! This is not your home! This is our mother's home! Hello. Hello. She brought you some presents. The servant. What? For you. What is it? I don't know. You tell me. If this is a joke, it's not funny. It's not a joke. It was her. You let her in. You had a bad dream, didn't you? Don't move from here. Stay and watch TV. And you? I'll be right back. In a matter of minutes, this unexpected eclipse will occur... If you are one of those who do not plan to miss it do not forget to directly observe the phenomenon... What a dump, man. Not even any mailboxes. It's 10 floors. Unless we go door to door... Too much racket. Then you tell me what we do. If I'm not out in half an hour, call Arruza. He'll know what to do. What the fuck... I stay here? Yeah. Wait, wait... Fuck. If she's up there, leave her to me. I deserve it. Good morning. Want a hand? Asshole. It's such a help, son. - Good morning. - Hi. This man's company has spoken to the owner about buying the building. We're an investment firm, but we want to consult the tenants first, of course. Of course. Come in. Thank you. Maybe if you know them, you can help me. The apartments aren't listed. Sure, we know everyone. You're sure helping me out. I have... María Rosa Luna. Which you say is you. Margarita Soliño... My sister. Perfect. Ramón Cantero. They left last year. The poor man was very ill. They went to Motril, Seems the air's better there. Sure, this must not be updated. And... Rocío Selvas. - Yes, yes. - Yes, yes. On... The 9th floor. But she just left yesterday. You don't know where? Maybe her sister, who arrived two days ago... She stayed with the girl, maybe she knows. Sure. You say it's the 9th... No, no, no. Don't get up. Alba. Rocío! Rocío. Alba. Don't speak. Don't move. Who did this to you? They did. - Who? - The women downstairs. They killed all those girls. They want Alba. They want Alba. Take her away. Please. No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. I'll get you out of here. No, no, don't go. Stay with me, stay with me. No, I can't. I can't. Forgive me. - Alba. - Forgive me for everything. Alba. Forgive me for everything. I'm sorry. And you say... you spoke to the owners. Yes, it's all settled. You say that Rocío Selvas is on the 9th, what else? That's odd. Because I'm the owner and I don't recall speaking to you. Is it my age? Ladies, let's make this easy. It is easy. Why have you come? 9th floor... what else? 9D. A factor that puzzles the scientific community, is its orbital trajectory. Which seems to be defying the limitations of the elongation value. This is going to cause this eclipse that is already imminent... They said there's going to be an eclipse. We're going. Where to? What's wrong? Is there another way out of the building? No. Can Alba play? She doesn't want to. Go home. We'll do a beauty salon. Olivia, now's not the time. She doesn't want to play? No, she doesn't! But I want to play. Open the door. What's wrong? Get in your room and don't come out. An hour inside and he won't answer his phone. Motherfucker. I knew it. The girl's not alone. They fooled us good, huh? Looks like it, but we'll sort it out. Leave it to me, skipper. I'll go in there and raise fucking hell. I swear on my life, this time she won't get away. You stay put. No one comes out. We're gonna do things right, the way they should be done. Okay. As soon as I saw her I knew she'd be trouble. I don't know what she's into, but it's not good. Do you think she suspects? She's scared, like her sister. But she's not leaving, she's boxed in. The messenger is ready. Let him out. He's to spread the glad tidings. Who are you? Hi, cutie. Do you live here? Yes. I'm after a friend who came here a couple of days ago. Her name's Lucía. Do you know her? That's me. I mean the other Lucía, maybe you've seen her. Another one? Yes, blonde, very pretty. Do you know her? Get under the bed. Don't make any noise And whatever happens, don't come out. It's her. Do you believe me now? The planet is nigh. The consuls have arrived. There is no turning back. Let's bring the girl. - Victor! - Wait. - We have to get out of here. - No, wait, wait. The bag. Where is it? Forget the bag, they're here, Victor! They found me. Moro's here and loads more, but we can't stay in here! Let's go. What are you doing? This changes things, right? Who the fuck is that? Let's go, please. There's something there. Where's the bag? What? - Where's the bag? - Victor! What are you doing? Where is it? In the closet. The closet. What closet?! There. In the bathroom. Good. Good. Now I'll tell you what we're going to do. I'm going to tell them... I looked for you on my own and I have the bag. I'm giving it to them, OK? But you realize I can't let you talk, right? No. No, I swear. My love, it's not you, it's them. They'd get it out of you, they have Calvo. And I can't allow that. Tell me you understand. Victor. Victor, please. Leave her alone. - Tell me you understand. - Victor, don't do it. Victor. Leave her alone! What a fucker. Leave her alone! Lucía. Skipper. This it? What a shithole. These guys are jacked up. They're down to party. Then let's give it to them. Ok. I don't know who the fuck's inside, but they're gonna pay. Especially the girl. I want to see her face. Don't worry, I'll get her, I swear. But alive. I'm down to party too. I'll get her, don't worry. Let's get to it. Listen to me... Run. Run out to the street, okay? Stop anyone you see and tell them they have to help you, to call the police. No, you have to teach me how to dance. You promised. It seems you met her servant. Now only she remains. The lady of this house, the mother of pain, the mother of all that is sad. We invoked her. We gave her their blood. Poor little girls, right? It's alright, sweetie. Come with me. - No, no, no. - Lucía. No, please. Alba. Alba. Please. Lamaasthu. She's been here since then. All these years. Feeding on this house, from its pain, from every scream, from every tear. Growing. Awaiting a body to incarnate. The day has finally come, the day of the coronation. Let her go. No, don't you understand? She's the chosen one. She will be a marvelous queen. You have to forgive us about your sister. It was an unforeseen event. She wanted to taker her away. We couldn't affort it. Don't cry. It's over. Your part ends here. It's over. You've done very well. If I had power in the firmament, this night black as a well, with a little moon knife I'd slice the bars of your cell. If I were the queen of daylight, of the wind and the sea, I'd bind myself with slave ropes, so that you might be free. O sorrow, little sorrow, sorrow of my heart, that flows through my veins, with the force of a cyclone. Just like a cloudy sky dark and flinty, it is a runaway colt that knows not where it goes. It is a desert of sand, sorrow, it is my glory in prison. O sorrow, O sorrow, O sorrow, little... sorrow. You have to teach me how to dance, you promised. Let's dance. What the fuck is this? What the fuck is that smell? Shit! What the fuck? What's happening? It's Lamaasthu, she's breaking through. She's here. Christ, Lucía, you sure messed up. All you had to do was dance. I'm dancing. I like it like that. Don't you have to dance? C'mon, dance. Nobody laughs at Moro. Come on! Get up! If you won't dance, I will. Look. Party never stops, huh? It won't stop. Ever. She's here! SHE'S HERE! It was you. It was always you. I should've seen it. Who are you? Lucía. The one who brings the daylight. I forgive you.
