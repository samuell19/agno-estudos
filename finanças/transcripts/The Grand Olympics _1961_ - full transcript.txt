Produced by Istituto Nazionale Luce for the Organizing Committee for the Games of the XVI Olympiad The Grand Olympiad August 25, 1960. Five thousand athletes from all over the world fake the last few steps, on the banks of the tiber, of the long road that has brought them fo the Rome summer Olympics. Pindar said 2,500 years ago, 'let toll and battles pause, so that the young may face each other in the peaceful contest of the games.? At the head of the parade is the flag of Greece, representative of the founding nation of these competitions. The flag bearer is prince constantine. Thirteen days earlier, on mount Olympus, the last priestess repeated, in the ancient temple of Jupiter, the custom of lighting the flame with the rays of the sun. Panayotis Epitropoulos, and after him more than 1,000 other torchbearers, will carry the flame fo Rome. At Piraeus, the port of Athens, the torch boards the amerigo vespucci, a ship bedecked in swollen sails, like the ship of Ulysses. The 5,400 athletes from 84 nations arrive in Rome. Meanwhile, the torch makes landfall at the southernmost tip of Italy, the port of Syracuse. From here, continuing on its journey, it travels up through the ancient districts of magna graecia. For many towns in the south, the olympiad was a mere moment - the passage of a torchbearer. Here they begged the boy who awaited his turn as the bearer fo light their small stove, fo preserve the memory of this day. The torch enters the region of Lazio. It passes the promontory of the Circeo. It is retracing the steps of the great Aeneas. Men of every race, religion, and political affiliation are received, on the Eve of the games, by the pope in St. Peter's square. From this square, messages of brotherhood have always been issued to the world. This is the voice of John XXIII. Like true athletes, bear witness before the audience to the ancient saying, 'mens sana in corpore sano.? At 9:00 pm on August 24, the torch arrived at the campidoglio. There, the flame was safeguarded for the entire night. August 25. The grand olympiad begins. This is the parade of the representatives of 84 nations, the most harmonious march the world has ever seen. The two germanies are united under the banner of sports. For the Japanese, these games are a gress rehearsal for the Tokyo games in 1964. The torch leaves the campidoglio. Now, two festive events follow one another n the warm Roman afternoon. Rafer Johnson, decathlete and philosopher, is the flag bearer for the usa. Another champion, the weight lifter Yuri vlasov, leads the Soviet contingent. Edoardo mangiaroft, fencer and five-time olympic champion, bears the flag of Italy, which, as the host nation, closes the parade. The President of the organizing committee, Giulio Andreotti, opens the ceremony. Toaay, the entire world is truly represented. The President of the Republic of Italy Avery Brundage, president of the international olympic committee, invites the Italian president fo proclaim the opening of the games. I proclaim the opening of the olympic games of Rome, celebrating the xvii olympiad of the modern era. Finally, the flag with the five rings. It was last in Melbourne. For a few days, it will be the flag of the world. The last of the 1,198 forchbearers is Giancarlo peris, a student. Adolfo consolini, olympic champion in 1948, pronounces the oath. ?On behalf of all participating athletes, I swear that we shall compete in the olympic games with fairness.? The semifinal of the 4x100 medley relay. It features the greatest swimmers in the four specialties - backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle. The Russian barbier passes on a strong lead to his teammate kolesnikov. The Italian lazzari, last on the left, tries to catch up. The Soviet trainer observes his boys. Llazzari is exhausted at the finish. The Italian dennerlein has fo catch up fo world-famous athletes. Dennerlein's style, power that churns the water. From this moment, on the back leg, he begins his comeback. He overtakes the Soviet on his left dennerlein fights for first place with the Japanese swimmer. With four strokes, he catches up. He passes him. He is first in his leq. He tags a young Bianchi, who will lead the Italians to the finals with the same time as the Japanese. The individual road race is 175 km. There are 136 cyclists. Moroccan, Mexican, Korean, from all over the world. It is the Germans' race fo lose. For the past three years they have been world champions. But the protagonists of this race will be an 18-year-old Soviet officer and an apprentice baker from montefiascone, Italy. The pace is relentless. The heat melts the asphalt and the cyclists' strength. An Ethiopian with sunstroke is carried off like a wounaed condor. 40 km from the finish, on the hill leading fo via di grottarossa, lieutenant Viktor kapitonov, an amateur, breaks away. Only the Italian livio trape follows. All the others fall behind. 30 km from the finish, trape overtakes kapitonov, who lets trape drag him along like a wagon for two laps. Trape is hunched over. The bulge on his back is a wet sponge. On the second-fo-last lap, kapitonov takes off, thinking it's the final sprint. He has miscalculated. There is another lap fo go. He may not be a great mathematician, but he's a marvelous sprinter. The baker from montefiascone, who knows this, tries to gain ground. They both have one specific goal. Trape must avoid dragging kapitonov. While kapitonov must force the other fo drag him to the finish, before trying to sprint over the line. They are still together at the final kilometer they begin a series of feints and stops, as if they were on a track. Neither wants to lead the final sprint. Trape brakes, and so does kapitonov. The finish line is in sight, at the end of the Avenue. Trape sees it. With a jolt, he takes the lead. He is definitely first. 200 meters fo go. A hundred and fifty. A hundred. He is still in the lead. At 50 meters, it's still trape. But kapitonov attacks on the outside. He overiakes him and wins by half a wheel, maybe less. Kapitonov's triumph is trape's despair. He will never again win at the Olympics. This was the only Italian loss in cycling. The first Italian victory was in the team time trial in which 25 nations took part. 100 km of blind chase, all four team members bound by their mutual weaknesses. The young Italian team lengthened its lead one lap at a time. Giacomo fornoni, chimney sweep, Antonio bailetti, baker, our friend livio trape... Oftavio cogliati, a mechanic. On the road to victory, the Italians overtook rivals who had started before them and pulled them along like castaways. And after two hours and 14 minutes, they blasted over the finish line, escorted by Belgians and spaniards. The 1500m final at the olympic stadium. During the first few laps, the French pin their hopes on Michel Bernard. Pushing hard, Bernard sets a pace, a rhythm for the race that could result in a new world record. But Elliott overtakes the Romanian vamos and the Swedish waern. He duels with Bernard, overtaking him shortly before the 900-m Mark. Bernard is overtaken by the Hungarian rozsavolgyr and his own compatriot, jazy. Elliott is at this point approaching world-record time. At the 1000-m Mark he begins his victory run. As he had planned, he finishes the race with a time of 3.35.6, a new world and olympic record. In second place, jazy, a 24-year-old typesetter. In third, the Hungarian rozsavolgy:. An astonishing six athletes beat the olympic record. In the shot put, its come down to bill nieder and pat o'brien. Nieder, 26 years old, 233 lbs, is a naval officer. He was a baseball champion. A fractured knee ended his career. He still has a taste for violent sports, and plans on taking up boxing, because, he says, shot put has turned his right arm info a cudgel. And his left, he says, is just naturally strong. But before nieder becomes a boxer, he will break the olympic winning streak of pat o'brien. Twenty-eight years old, 244 lbs, he is a bank teller. Q'brien created the new style of shot put. Thanks to his method and discipline, he has won at the last two olympic games. The us is the undisputed leader in this specially. O'brien throws for 19.11 m. Dallas long, 20 years old, 2601bs, is the baby in the American trio. He throws for 19.01 m. He will come in third. Nieder, with a throw of 19.68 m, overtakes o'brien. He takes the olympic record from him, reversing the Melbourne result. A Ukrainian student, Irina press, is the favorite in the 80m hurdles. The Australians, who had won this competlition in Melbourne, have been eliminated. The German competitor in the final is gisela birkemeyer. England has Mary bignal, a long jumper, and the model Carole Quinton. The javelin throw, as old as the world, is a gesture of classical beauly, whose technique has helped achieve astonishing results. But in Rome we will witness the fall of the gods. The greatest champions are here, but none will be among the first six. The 29-year-old Albert ?al? cantello, an American of Italian heritage, holding a world record of 86.04 m, invented this throwing style, with a final dive to the ground. But al cantello throws about 10 m below his usual ability. The Italian Carlo lievore, in recovery from an injury, can't lean on his heel, and does little fo improve on the American's result. But the cossack peasant Viktor tsybulenko gets in an excellent first throw. He is 30 years old and weighs 2221s. His javelin rests on a light gust of wind. This one throw of 84.84 m will be enough to win the gold medal. The long jump. They run on a track made of arr. Igor ter-ovanesyan, of the Soviet union, is third with 804 m. Ralph Boston, a student of chemistry from Tennessee, will win with 8.12 m. One man, filled with anxiety, is watching from the bleachers. It's Jesse Owens, a champion in Berlin in 1936. Boston erased Owens's name from the records book. With 8.21, he took his world record. Today, he beats his olympic record, before his very eyes. There's another American in the competition, roberson, whose concentration is intense, almost tortured. The triple jump. Today they're flying. Here is ira Davis, the American, who jumps, stops, and jumps again. 'Hop, stop, and jump,? as they say. The Polish schmidt, world champion, as agile as a hunting leopara, with 16.81, wins both the gold and the olympic record. Davis's atfempfs fo overtake him will be in vain. The 110m hurdles requires the speed of a great sprinter and the musical power of rhythm. The German Martin lauer, an aspiring actor and singer, is up against three outstanding American athletes - Willie may, a lanky man of 6?3', Hayes Jones and Lee Calhoun. In the final, all three are at the head of the pack. The German lauer tries to win at least a bronze medaal. He will not succeed. 13.8 for Calhoun, 13.8 for may, and 14 even for Jones. The baths of caracalla are the ideal setting for a gymnastics tournament. It's possible that not even in the ancient past have these walls witnessed such a lovely spectacle as that of the Japanese ikeda... And the Soviet astakhova with her fellow gymnasts. In 1932 in Los Angeles, the Japanese filmed the rehearsals of the Italian Romeo neri, the angel of rimini. Then they had all the time in the world fo stuay his moves and stylistic rigor. Ono studied that old film better than anyone else. In the featherweights, sebastiano mannironi with 352.5 kg, is third. The Soviet yevgeni minayev, with 372.5 kg, sets a world and olympic record. Eauardo Adriana of curagao, a smile and a calypso. Here are the heavyweights. It's after midnight. We are now in the world of the giants. The Czech vaclav syrovi on his own weighs 3001bs. Alberto pigaiani, a bus driver from Milan, 286 lbs. The planter from the antilles, Eduardo Adriana, 264 lbs and a calypso. This time, pigaiani successfully lifts 170 kg. A decent weight. It turns out to be too little. The gadget is taken up by the men who move mountains. They are James bradfora, 32 years old, 291 lbs, a librarian of congress in Washington, a humanist who divides his time between books and barbells; and the mining engineer Yuri viasov, a 25-year-old muscovite. The librarian wins the silver medal with 512.5 kg in three attempls. The engineer, a theoretician of the barbell, attacks the world record. Norbert schemansky, 36 years old, 240 lbs, will go on to win third place. His profession, thinker. The planter from the antilles can't seem fo catch a break. Yuri vlasov, like a prima Donna, powders his throat, so as to prepare a soft landing for the barbell, and in three attempts lifts the greatest weight ever by one man - 522.5 kg. Adriana can't resign himself to defeat. Good-bye, calypso and smiles. On the antillean plantations they won't sing the ?calypso Eduardo,? which had been composed fo celebrate his victory. Italy has joined the giants on the world stage of basketball, and together with the Soviet union, Brazil and the United States, has arrived at the palazzo dello sport for the finals. The Soviet union and Brazil face each other for second place and silver. In the end, the Soviets come out on top. Walter bellamy, 6?9', is the tallest us player. Not of the entire tournament, though, because the Soviets have extracted from the siberian forest a 7'1? lumberjack. The American team is made up of athletes who fower over everyone else. Their technique, imagination, and athleticism are on a superior level. But the very young Italian team dares fo take an early lead. They play as equals for the entire first half and end up with an honorable defeat and a more than honorable fourth place. The United States triumph. A silver medal for the siberian giant. The American team will take home, like an Indian's scalp, the baskets, as a trophy. In the football tournament, it will all come down to a hat for Italy and yugoslavia. In Naples, lots were drawn from a hat, which resulted in Italy's elimination. This method was made necessary by a one-all score after overtime in the game played at fuorigrofta. This was the tying goal. Tumburus scored. The olympic village. A small sun city, where for two weeks, young people of all races live together. Promises and romances are reborn. The fastest people alive, like Wilma Rudolph and livio berrut, lake a stroll, at a leisurely pace. The 6?5? American John Curtis Thomas, a boy from south Carolina, enjoys a high jump of 2.15 m, just for fun. Another champion of the high jump, the Georgian shaviakadze. He lets us film him in his room, while he kisses his son's portrait, and trims his western-style mustache. Thomas jumps as high as 2.20 m, almost reaching his limit. He's had a hard life, and is paying his way through school as a hotel elevator operator. The high jump has enriched his life. Good morning. Konrads, Australian swimming prodigy, human stopwatch. To whom is he talking? A Swiss? Some like to spend Sundays in the sun, like the German swimmer urselmann, the prettiest frog in the village. Or the Japanese ono, who rediscovers the aromas of nature. And some prefer fo explore the city, enjoying fashion and souvenirs. The 'no entry? sign is like a drawbridge at the gate of the women's village, also called the castello. Sundays are reserved for visitors. Raimondo d'lnzeo comes to chat with his friends, posillipo and merano. If it's true that sports unite peoples, their cuisines distinguish them, judging by the different menus. From cantonese rice fo Hungarian goulash, from porridge fo Russian salads. Something for everybody - 4,700 calories a day per athlete. Russian blondes raised on borscht and sturgeon, and American negroes brought up on oatmeal. An Espresso? No, a cafezinho. Pure Brazilian coffee. A sunaay gathering, kind of like a dance in an extended family. Armin hary, the sprinter the Germans think of as a bit too individualistic and intolerant of the rules, is reluctant to pass judgment on abstract art, even though he works in a furniture store. 'I have no desire,? he says, 'to pass myself off as an intellectual. My name is armin hary. I was born 23 years ago in quierschied, in saar. My name is armin hary. I was born 23 years ago in quierschied, in saar. I work in a furniture store. But what I really want to tell you is that I am the fastest man in the world. All I have left fo win is the Olympics, and that's why I'm here.? Naturally, there are others who have the same intention. The Americans sime and Norton. And even more so a Canadian who matched my world record of 10 seconds nthe 100m dash - Jerome. Mind you, this is the best place fo prove that I am faster than he is. This is my quarterfinal. [Win in 10.2 and sime is behind me by a tenth of a second. This is the start of the semifinals. I am not in the first heat the British radford precedes figuerola and Norton, but the real news is that Jerome pulls a muscle. From a selfish standpoint, I should rejoice. Instead, I'm very upset, because I really wanted to beat Jerome. I ran the 100m dash in 10 seconds three times, when all the experts and scholars of athletics said that a man who could run that fast would never be born. But then I, armin hary, was born, and in June, 1956, I played this joke on all the experts. But the judges said the track was on an incline and invalidated it I didn't fret. Then again, in June of 1960 in Zurich, I did it again. Again, the judges invalidated it. They said the wind helped me. I wait for there to be no wind at all, and an hour later I repeat 100 m in 10 seconds. Here is the next semifinal. Here is sime, who always smooths the track, and here is norfon. I win in 10.3 seconds, and sime and Norton get into the final with me. In the audience cheering me on is also Jesse Owens, once the fastest sprinter. Owens has said of me, that if I want, I can run like the devil. And I said, don't worry, Mr. Owens. I will. I intend fo.' here we are, at the final. We're all a bit nervous, honestly, and we try to distract ourselves by fiddling with the blocks and nails we need fo start before the race, we must concentrate. I really agonize between the 'ready' and the starter shot. They say that I steal a few fractions of a second. The truth is that my reflexes are in sync with the pistol, and as the shot goes off, a bullet shoots out of the starting blocks - me. The man you see trussed up like a space explorer is the judge, Mr. pedrazzin. He is going fo give us our start, and he looks more nervous than we are. Take your places! The 100m dash is also made of false starts. Each sprinter is allowed only one. Al the second, you are kicked out. Invalid. It is unclear whether the fault is mine or sime's. We start over Ready. This time, Mr. pedrazzini blames me. Again. No. Figuerola bows out. His nerves are shot this start is worth my life. I can't make another mistake. I feel the starter pistol like a gambler feels the caras. I feel it as it goes off. I start better than the others, not before. Here, watch my race again. I didn't start first as I could have, because I wanted to be sure they wouldn't stop me. No one can stop me now, and I win in 10.2 seconds, a new olympic record. And I'm very happy. Even though I had no doubt that it would end this way. Because I, armin hary, am the rfastest man in the world.? This equestrian competition is called eventing. It is the famous 34 km course full of jumps, paths, hedges, and ditches. A romantic and heroic event that's like a page out of pushkin come fo life in a valley nestled among Roman castles. This man and this horse have traveled thousands of mies from Australia fo come here, gallop and win on the pratoni del vivaro. Morgan is the winner. Salad days is his horse. No ships are sailing from Naples today. From faraway lands, flags and boats have arrived - from America, from New Zealand, from Argentina and from the bermudas. They are weighed like living creatures, sanded like precious wood, polished, stamped, and aelivered to the sea. Each helmsman, even if he is a prince, like constantine of sparta, becomes a carpenter, a mechanic, and a painter. Seven days of two-hour regattas, 288 participants, and 138 boats. In the five classes, one victory each goes to Greece, the Soviet union, Norway, United States, and Denmark. Constantine of Greece has won the dragon class. The royal family baptizes the champion in the sea of Santa Lucia. In Rome, the sun is at its peak when 41 walkers exit the stadium for a 50 km race. In the lead are John ljunggren, Swedish, 41 years old, a shoe store salesman, and the British Norman Thompson, bookkeeper for an insurance company. Meanwhile, the high jump champions go to salute their king. John Curtis Thomas, the 19-year-old who cleared 2.22 m before the Olympics. Thomas is often called a space-age kid. For a while he enjoys watching the others increase 3 cm at a time, not always successfully. The Georgian shaviakadze misses the 2 m jump. Here, at 2 m, is Thomas's first jump. One foot up on an invisible step. Thirteen athletes clear 2.03 m. The French ladriss and seven others can't The walkers are on the road fo the sea. Pamich and dordoni are elegant, but they're not at the head of the pack. The Indian ascetic zora Singh is in the lead. Halfway, Mr. Thompson comes to the fore. When they reenter the walls of Rome, the Italian pamich is fourth. Shavilakaadze, after his initial error, succeeds on his first try at every jump. He is a normal man, who succeeds thanks to his method and dedication, whereas Thomas leaves the ground with angelic grace. The last few kilometers along the tiber. In the lead are ljunggren and Thompson. Ljunggren won the London Olympics 12 years ago. Thompson, then a mere boy, cheered him on. Evening falls. Shaviakadze clears 2.1 m. Another Soviet, valeri brumel, 18 years old, follows suit. Thomas missed on the first try. He succeeds on the second and relaxes. Mr. Thompson is in the lead. In London, he trained by walking in his house while boiling large pots of water, because Rome, he had been fold, is a warm and humid city. Shavilakadze, again on the first try, clears 216 m. Thomas is no longer the unbeatable phenomenon he has always thought. Even young brumel this evening is outperforming him. Thomas, for the first time, realizes that he could lose. Third attempt, last jump. Last mistake. Defeat comes at the hands of shaviakaadze, the 28-year-old athlete who has had to work hard for his first great victory. Another man who has patiently forged his destiny as a champion is Norman Thompson. He is winning the 50 km walk. We cannot honestly say that his form is impeccable. But now that he is sure, he straightens his body so he can give the archives of the olympiad a distinguished winner's profile. Thompson walks foward victory with the same rapid step with which he walks fo the bus headed for piccadilly. Third, after ljunggren, is pamich. Dordoni, seventh, has lost the olympic record he won in Helsinki. Many champions from Helsinki and Melbourne have won again in Rome. But many have lost, in one day, the illusion of having stopped time. At the olympic pool, the great swimmers, creatures entirely at home in the water. The final of the 100m butterfly. Some seem drawn into the water as by a magnet. The American Carolyn schuler, and the Australian jan Andrew. Finally, a clean start. In Lane 4, the 18-year-old brunette Carolyn schuler, first in the water, first passes the 50-m Mark. But what is happening in Lane 67 Carolyn wood, us champion, has swallowed some Walter she is forced to stop. Schuler wins, as she intended. With 1.09.5 she sets a new olympic record. Carolyn wood was left stranded. No longer a champion, but just a weak, 15-year-old girl in need of assistance. Another highly anticipated women's race, the 100m freestyle. The us is represented by the blond baroness, Chris Von saltza, a 16-year-old of Scandinavian heritage, the daughter of a general; Australia by dawn Fraser, a 22-year-old typist who feels old for this sport. In fact, she has decided, 'after this race, I will be a wife.? With a time of 1.01.2, dawn Fraser matches the world record. She leaves Rome with a gold medal and a wedding dress. Is that a drop of water or a tear on Von saltza's cheek? The last leg of the medley relay 4x100 final is Von saltza's revenge. You can see her swimming furiously. 'Swimming is one of the best things fo have happened to me,? she says. In the men's 100m freestyle race, the duel is renewed. Dark-haired John devitt, Australia, Lane 3, against blond Lance Larson, United States, Lane 4. But the first 50 m see the rise of an unexpected customer, the Brazilian manoel dos Santos, Jr., son of a famous swimmer. Dos Santos is in the foreground. He's the first to turn. Larson and devitt turn together. Dos Santos is still in the lead, but 25 m from the finish, Larson and devitt overtake him. The American Larson is third from the bottom. The Australian is fourth. They touch the edge simultaneously. Who won? The timers say Larson. Most of the judges will say devitt. The applause from devitt and the silver medal cannot comfort Larson. He's only 20 years old. A lifetime will not suffice to convince him that he came in second. The final of the 4x100 medley relay. The last leg of John Farrell, the fastest swimmer in the us and perhaps the world. Four days after an appendectomy, he dove into the water for the olympic trials. He was excluded from the 100m. But with a desperate effort, he gained a spot in the relay race in Rome. Now, with his teammates mckinney, hail, and Larson, he beats the world record. Australia is second, Japan is thira, and Italy is sixth. Farrell leaves swimming for medicine. He says sports will no longer be the purpose of his existence. The lights come on at the palazzo dello sport before the greatest evening of Italian boxing. In the ten final matches, there are six Italians. The light middleweight Carmelo bossi is up against the outstanding American, wilfred mcclure. Bossi, the shorter man, attempts to move in on his opponent. But in the final, mcclure prevails. There is no uncertainty as fo the success of Giovanni benvenuti, from trieste, the welterweight who embodies the true nobility of the pugilistic arts. Benvenuti teaches his opponents boxing by receiving them in the ring with the courtesy of the consummate host. As practiced by him, boxing becomes a sport devoid of crude violence. In the second round, he knocks down Yuri radonyak, a mountain man from the caucasus. But this is merely a more concrete representation of his teaching. Benvenuti shows his guests many courtesies. In particular, he spares them his punishing right hook. Then again, no one dares to bother him. The olympic championship is but a formality for the boxer from trieste. As were two European titles and 100 victories in as many matches. Francesco de piccoll's boxing style rests on a single, lethal premise - it is punishingly violent. De piccoli is left-handed. He uses his right to get within range with his left this is the final against Daniel de bekker, a south African from the cape of good hope. De piccoli slams him with his left, and, why not, also with his right. De bekker is counted out by the umpire. We're halfway through the first round. Again, de piccoli pummels de bekker, who, tired of the brutal punishment, awaits his knockout as a respite. A tray of meaals is needed just for the Italian team. A bronze medal for saraud, three silver for zamparini, lopopolo and bossi, and three gold meaals for musso, benvenuti, and de piccol. The memorable evening ends with the sweet smile of de piccoli, the boxer who is afraid only of his mom. End of first half the grand olympiad second half a Sunday in September. The romans are all at the beach. They've left the city, a giant playground, fo the kids of the Olympics. The love story between connolly and the Czech Olga fikotova began four years ago in Melbourne. A high-level meeting on the steps of trinita dei monti. Bing Crosby and Vera krepkina - art, beauty, and strength. Leave a coin in the fountain, and in exchange, if possible, bring home a flag from the games. A Roman sunset and a carriage. This is how, back in Melbourne, Mr. and Mrs. connolly, gold medalists in Australia, imagined their honeymoon. In the history of man, fighting has been a vital necessity. Greeks and romans wrote strict rules. The Roman olympiad has reopened among the ruins of the palatine the old home of wrestling. On the three mattresses arranged under the arches of the basilica of maxentius there are matches between athletes of greco-Roman, and freestyle wrestling. Living sculptures, modern representations of homeric tales, faces contorted by pain and by the anxious fear of elimination. By legalizing leg holds, modern athletes created the nervous freestyle discipline. The patient search for the perfect hold creates drama, but also humor, as it does here, where they appear to argue over a shoe. In greco-Roman wrestling, three medals for the Soviets, three for the turks, one for Romania, one for Bulgaria. In freestyle wrestling, four gold medals go to Turkey, three to the United States, and one to Germany. The final match of water Polo. The Italians practically have the gold in hand. They just have to prove themselves against the incumbent champions, the Hungarians. Italy, in the black caps, has the youngest team of all, which was craftily arranged by zogliomi, thelr instructor twelve years have passed since their win at the London games. The new settebello team has arrived. The Hungarians start out strong. They will achieve a 2-0 lead. Felkai is the first to score. The Italians fight back. They throw from every position. This goal by parmegiani narrows the lead, 1-2 right away lavoratori scores again, 2-2. But at the end of the first half, the score is 3-2 for the Hungarians. The Italians attack, but they can't even the score. One throw bounces off the goal post. Then the ball goes in, but the umpire deems it invalid. Boros, the Hungarian goalie, stops another ball. Italy"s rossi is just as effective. The Italian team attacks constantly. The Hungarians are forced to commit several fouls to block their attacks. Finally, the umpire punishes the Hungarians with a free throw. Bardi throws. Goal! The score is even. Italy finishes undefeated ahead of the Soviet union and Hungary. Never has an olympic tournament been fought so hard. Four teams started out with an equal shot at the title. Shot put and discus throwing require strength from the ladies. These giantesses demand respect. This is Mrs. earlene brown, a housewife from Los Angeles, who weighs 249 lbs. The Soviet Nina ponomaryova, as proud as a valkyrie. Miss yevgeniya kuznetsova, pleasantly arranged on a frame of 5?9?, weighing 180 lbs. Mrs. Olga fikotova connolly. No matter the result, she has garnered everyone's admiration. Ponomaryova wins with 55.10 m, a new olympic record. Mama brown is sixth. Yevgeniya kuznetsova, fifth. And Mrs. connolly doesn't add any prize fo the admiration she has already been shown. Women of great strength are invited fo take part in the shot put. Mrs. Valerie sloper is six feet tall and wears an elegant, dark outfit. Her throw will win her fourth place. Tamara press, of the Soviet union, will set a new olympic record of 17.32 m. Incidentally, her measurements - height, 5?9?; Weight, 207 lbs. Here, again, is Mrs. brown, with an excellent throw for third place. The day is now over. Here, once again, are the guests of honor in this exceptional fashion show. From the left, Johanna litlge, Germany, Tamara press, Soviet union, earlene brown, United States. The final of the 400m race is one for the history books. Among the participants, Carl kaufmann and the American Otis Davis, who matched the world record, 45.2, established in "56 by Jones. The German kinder, the Indian milkha Singh, and the south African Spence take off like shols. Kinder ralls behind. Milkha Singh and Spence hang on almost until they come out of the turn, when Otis Davis, at the center, and kaufmann on the inside, catch up. Otis Davis runs with his torso leaning backward. His legs seem to be running away from the rest of his body. Fifty meters from the finish, kaufmann begins his comeback. Davis holds on. His for so catches up fo his legs and cuts the string first. Kaufmann collapses. Otis Davis discovers that his time, 44.9 is a new world record. Kaufmann is given the same time. A photo finish for a world record. Ephemeral in the hands of man, the divine task of stopping time. Otis Davis can't believe what he has accomplished. Until two years ago, he played basketball. This very morning, he wasn't sure that he had chosen the right sport. Two aays later, Davis runs the last leg of the 4x400 relay race. He sets a hew world record. At the ceremony, he is joined by his white brothers, Jack yerman, Earl young, and the violent Glenn Davis, winner of the 400m hurdles. Glenn Davis says, ?I love it when the race is violent ? the Soviet Vera krepkina has won the long jump. Her result, a surprising 6.37 m on the third jump, sels a new world record. Slow motion is like a lle detector. It reveals secrets that distance and speed keep hidden. Here is the truth about Beverly weigel, from New Zealand. And about hildrun claus, from Germany, bronze medalist around her eyes, anxiely traces a painful shadow. In front of the palazzo dei congress, two fencers illustrate a match as they see it, and the public cannot. In the passion of their attack is a lightning-fast conversation. Mangiarotti and saccaro are perfecting the timing of a secret move. Amid the din of the tournament, the blades follow invisible patterns. As is traditional, the Hungarians win the saber. The Italian wiadimiro calarese manages to win bronze behind karpati, member of the old school, and horvath, best of the up-and-comers. In the foil, the contest is no longer reserved to the French and the Italians, as it has been for 48 years. The winner is Viktor zhdanovich, a education student from Leningrad. In the final match with the epee, Giuseppe Delfino, on the right, faces off against Allan Jay, a Scottish billionaire. Delfino has won almost all his previous matches with one thrust, after letting the regulatory time go by, while waiting for his rival to attack and expose himself to his infallible parry and thrust. His matches conjure ancient duels, which hung on a single blow. But in the final match, Delfino attacks Jay up and down the floor. The six regulatory minutes are enough for him to win. Delfino is 39 years old. He's the manager of a tire factory. His long and honorable athletic career has been spent chasing this victory. Now that he's achieved it, he frees his nerves and exhaustion from the prison in which he has been holding them. Giuseppina Leone, from turin, one of the best Italian athletes, faces Wilma Rudolph, a 19-year-old from Tennessee, in the semifinal. Leone is second with 11.6. Rudolph, with 11.3 matches the world record. In the final, Leone and Rudolph meet again. It's a windy afternoon. Wilma Rudolph runs faster than the wind. She wins in 11 seconds. An amazing result, which, because of the wind, is not considered valid. Rudolph is admirable even off the track. She carries herself like a queen. Giuseppina Leone is thira, with the same time as hyman. Wilma Rudolph revels in her happiness, rewarded by a fate that has finally decided to treat her kindly. Until the age of seven, 17th of 19 siblings, Wilma couldn't walk. Until the age of 11, she used crutches, before expressing her love of life in the meadows and stadiums of Tennessee. The track is being prepared for the final of the women's 200m race. The festival of the black Pearl ends with the last leq of the 4x100 relay. A new world and olympic record. Between heats and finals, Rudolph runs nine races in nine days. In each race, she is in the lead from start to finish. The American tobian, winner of the 3m springboard, with one and a half somersaults and a double twist from 10 m, one of the most amazing dives. A reverse pike with one and a half somersaults by the 10 m winner, Webster. The champion embraces his wife. In the women's 3m springboard, the gold goes to the German Kramer. A reverse dive with one and a half somersaults. Backward dive with one and a half somersaults and two and a half twists, the most difficult dive of the event In pole vaulting, the Soviet viadimiro volatov fractures an ankle. Everyone's attention is focused on the picturesque performance given by the American Donald George bragg, the Tarzan of American athletics. Don bragg is 25 years old. Height, 62?; Weight, 196. At home, in his backyard, he has created a jungle of ropes strung from the trees. He practices, in his homemade jungle, swinging back and forth, like Tarzan. Only his compatriot Ronald Morris can follow him up to 4.60 m. Now Don Bragg begins his oft-repeated argument with the world record. Bragg had taken it to 4.80 at an outdoor meet then to 4.87 in an indoor meet his vault is extraordinarily fast. The power in his arms, breathtaking. Morris fumbles the 4.70 vault The student from the catholic villanova university religiously prepares for the final vault. Don Bragg is the new champion and olympic gold medalist. The darkness and the solemn moment are pierced by a joyful shout, like a victory song - Tarzan's cry. On the track of the olympic velodrome, Sante Gajaradoni he was born a peasant. The first time on the track, he ran away, frightened by the height of the sides. The leader of the Dutch tandem pair has fallen from that height. The pain of giving up is greater than the pain of his wound. The tandem, ancient instrument, comes down from the attic every four years, for the Olympics. The two members of the Italian parr, Sergio bianchetto and Giuseppe Beghetto, face the German pair in the final. The race is run over four laps. Alt first, with sudden stops, controlled slow riding and feints, the rivals enact the familiar play of trickery. Meanwhile, galardoni is warming up. Suddenly, the tandem flies like an arrow. They reach a speed of almost 43.5 mph. Biancheftto and beghetto are braver, and also, faster. They go first into the last turn. They hold off the attack of the Germans for a clear win. They are both 21 years old, both from the suburbs of padua. They are both 58" and weigh 154 lbs. But beghetto, the second, follows. Bianchetto, the leader, is in control, now, all their ardor and irreverence melt away with their tears of joy. Mario vallotfo, Marino vigna, Franco testa and Luigi arienti are the foursome in the team pursuit event. Four splendid robots in a machine whose level of automation is astounding. In the semifinal, these four improved on the olympic record. In the final, they race against Germany. Theirs is a convoy that advances smoothly. Each switch is executed almost by rofe. The German team holds on until halfway through the race. The Italian team, lap by lap, increases its speed, so smoothly as to be almost imperceptible. They win with an average speed of more than 33 mph. Gasparella and galardoni have qualified for the final of the sprint event. In the semifinal, gasparella races against the Belgian Leo sterckx. Gasparella, the fastest amateur sprinter before gaiardoni appeared, yearns for one more great win. But sterckx makes a remarkable comeback. Gailardoni just won the world championship against sterckx, two weeks ago. Now he's giving him a rematch. The Belgian is a rider who knows all the tricks of the trade, and gailardoni is recovering from a fall. Here they are in the final race. Galardoni starts off in the lead. Sterckx is right behind him. Galardoni feints a sprint, then climbs and waits. He swoops down. He's going to take off. No. He would rather wait some more. And sterckx stays on him. The second-to-last turn. The Belgian jumps ahead on the inside. He's leading into the last turn. Gaiardoni tries to overtake him on the outside. Unbelievable. He succeeds' This is galardoni's second gold medal. He won the first one in the timed trial he goes from one specially to the other with equal ability. He has mastered the long and short sprint. He has both speed and power. Whether he is racing against a rival or the clock makes no difference to him. Regardless, he never stands to lose. A sea of maharajas and maharanis watches the field hockey final, as usual played by India and Pakistan. August 23, 1960 is the historic date on which Pakistan, thanks to a point scored by naseer, beats India, which had won at the Olympics for 32 straight years. From persia, where it was invented at the dawn of time, hockey has migrated to the Indian peninsula, and become the national pastime of 600 million people. Over and over, the Indians attacked their Pakistani cousins, trying to even the score. The game was of the highest quality, but we couldn't decide where to look - whether at the game, the bearas, the saris, the sikh player's bun, at the goalies, trussed up like ancient oriental warriors, or at the female figures right out of the Arabian nights. We spent the afternoon inside one of rudyard kipling's stories. For sure, somewhere in the crowd, were Kim, child of the jungle, and the mongoose rikki-tikki-tavi. In the storm, the beach umbrellas double as brollies, and the umpires are forced to wrap up in nylon coveralls. But we must have the garden partly in honor of the Romanian lolanda balas, the creature born to jump. Her legs occupy a large portion of her 6'1? frame. Jaroslawa jozwiakowska, Poland, clears 1.71 m. She will be the best of many girls we shall see complete excellent jumps, within the limits, of course, allowed women by nature. But balas is built for jumping. She doesn't even need fo follow the guidelines of proper technique. Jumping is in her very nature. For her, jumping is like walking. For the others, each attempt causes stress, anxiety or exhilaration, all feelings which balas no longer remembers. Alone and indifferent, she prepares the ground for her jump. For her, the exciting challenge is not that of beating her rivals, but that of beating herself, that is, her own world record. As usual, none of the others are still in the competition. Lolanda balas is alone, but this evening a great victory awaits her, and will restore her pleasure in winning. This evening she did not beat herself. But a gold medal and an olympic record are still capable of moving the girl whose fate was to be born to jump. That of the decathlon is the story of a friendship. One aay, at the university where rafer Johnson, a young texan, studies political science and sociology, a rich, shy boy from formosa showed up. Yang chuan-kwang, majoring in dentistry. Yang wanted to practice an athletic discipline, and rafer Johnson said, ?why only one? Do what I do, and practice all of them.? Rafer Johnson is 25 years old. He is 62? and weighs 198 lbs. He is the man who most closely resembles the ideal olympic athlete. He has the slender legs of a sprinter, and powerful chest and arms. Yang chuan-kwang is 27 years old. He is 6' tall and weighs 170 lbs. He is more agile than powerful. He runs the 100m dash in 10.7 seconds and jumps into first place. In the long jump, Johnson jumps 7.35 m. Vasily kuznetsov, the Soviet professor of natural science, who was world champion before Johnson, continues to lose ground. More contests of agility, in which Yang is stronger. With a jump of 7.46 m, the Chinese lengthens his lead. During breaks, rafer Johnson and Yang kwang are always close, but athletic rivalry is beginning fo divide them. Yang's shot put throw is 13.33 m. Johnson, with 15.82, is vastly superior, and passes everyone else. A storm, portent of fall, is sweeping through Rome. But the rules require completion of the two remaining events before midnight, otherwise the entire first part would be invalidated. In the evening, finally, the competition can resume. Johnson jumps 1.85 m. But this is one of Yang's specialties. 1.90. Johnson's lead is reduced to 75 points. The 400m dash. Yang beats Johnson by two tenths of a second. By the end of the first day, his lead is a mere 55 points. ?Yang is doing better and better. I taught him how to do the decathlon. Maybe I taught him too well.? ?Vasily, which of us do you think rafer fears the most?? The 110m hurdles. The Italian sar is catching up to the first runners, and wins his heat. And so does Johnson. 15.3 And so does Yang, with such an excellent time, 14.6, that he jumps to the top of the scoreboard. The discus requires great strength, as well as agility. And Yang's throw is almost 9 m shorter than Johnson's, and 11 shorter than kuznetsov's, who finds himself in third place, while Johnson is again in first. A three-man consultation. 'I was a guest of the professors in Moscow. He's a true gentleman.? Thus, Johnson speaks of kuznetsov. The pole vault is the most difficult event for Johnson, who must hoist up to 4.710 m almost 220 lbs. Yang clears 4.30 and finds himself only four points away from Johnson. Only two events are left in the decathlon. 'If I don't score a lot of points in the javelin throw, Yang will overtake me in the last race.? ?If I hold my own with the javelin, I'm stronger than rafer in the 1500m.? The most relaxed is kuznetsov, too far behind to harbor any hopes, even though he's stronger in javelin and middle distance running. Johnson throws for 69.66. Yang for 68. Kuznetsov for 71.20. The final event, the 1500m. The hardest for exhausted athletes. Johnson has a lead that Yang could eliminate only with an extraordinary result. Johnson, whose huge muscles are perhaps more exhausted than Yang's slender ones, attaches himself to his friend. A strange figure makes its way around the track - black muscles surrounding a slender, translucent boay. Now that he knows his lead is secure, Johnson lets go. Even sar overtakes him. And now, completely spent, he leans on Yang's shoulder. Yang is left with his despair. Not even his dearest friend, his father, can comfort him. The next day, the awards were given. Johnson wore a suit, the appropriate attire for a professor and a philosopher, since he had declared his intention of leaving sports and becoming a missionary to travel the world helping his people. Now they were together on the podium - the American Johnson, the Chinese Yang, and the Soviet kuznetsov. They had become three friends. In piazza di Siena, the individual jumping event, one of the most noble and challenging spectacles of the games. Fourteen obstacles, all at least 1.30 m high, fo be cleared in a time that would be challenging even at a full gallop. Raimondo d'inzeo on posillipo is the only rider with no faults. His brother piero awaits his turn. With silken reins, raimondo guides his old horse, posillipo, over every difficult jump. Who will be able to best him? Piero d'inzeo, on the rock, is one of the best riders. Only four penalties in his previous run. With exceptional mastery, he recovers his seat, and is on his way to win second place. Raimondo and piero d'inzeo, gold and silver medalists. Their performances have been admired many times in piazza di Siena, but foaay it feels as if we were seeing them for the first time. 'It's me again, wearing number 15, armin hary, and this is the story of the relay race that my teammates and I run, and win.? The 4x100 relay race. The wait is feverish. Groping hands wait for the Baton, which passes from one to the other. Germany, with lauer on the last leg, wins the first semifinal in 39.7 seconds, ahead of Venezuela and Great Britain. In the second semifinal, the American, budd, is fastest of the first leg. The Baton is passed to Norton. Then to Johnson. And sime holds onto the lead. Berruti receives the Baton after sime and the Soviet ozolin. Qzolin catches up. The Italian team is second and gets into the final. Adolfo consolini is participating in his fourth olympiad. His throw is almost equal fo the one with which he won in London, 12 years ago, and it's amazing that he shows no decline in strength. But the others, the young athletes, throw farther and farther The Americans repeat their success at the Melbourne games. Cochran will win the bronze. Babka is the strongest. His discus will clear 58.02 m. But a wall street broker, al qoerter, not as powerful, but faster than babka, on his last throw, lets the discus fly as if he were a human slingshot. A new olympic record - 59.18 m. Three medals, the fourth American sweep, a consolation for losing their supremacy in the sprinting events, which was snatched away by the Europeans. A tradition of winning that had lasted 28 years. And here, in the relay race, at stake for the us are 40 years of domination. The four Germans are together - cullmann, hary, mahlendorf, and lauer, as are the four Americans - budd, Norton, Johnson and sime. Sime breaks the wool thread ahead of lauer. The world and olympic record, 39.05, is matched. But the scoreboard, inexplicably, remains blank. It appears that the first exchange between us feammates, budd and Norton, was invalid. Hary and his teammates are tempfted fo savor an unexpected victory, but the council of ten is gathering eyewitness testimony. Finally, the irregularity is ascertained and the American team is disqualified. All their attention on this affair, the judges have overlooked an episode that for the Italians and the British is just as crucial, if not more so. But we can show you images that reveal exactly what happened. In the foreground is the British athlete. Radford passes the Baton fo Jones. Jones receives it too late. Radford's despair is more honest and eloquent than any testimony. The judges had other things on their mind. Four medals go to the Germans, Four silver medals to the Soviets, and the British are awarded the bronze. You got lucky, eh? Bye, hary. Lake albano is in the crater of an ancient volcano. A network of steel cables has been laid in its waters, and within its boundaries, wooden missiles glide along. The finals take place on a warm afternoon. In the single sculls, the Soviet vyacheslav Ivanov maintains a serene 32-stroke pace. He has no rivals at castel gandolfo, as he had none in Melbourne. The coxswain's head skims the water, and etches, as a diamond on glass, the course of the German scull. A series of smooth strokes followed by a few violent sprints. Knubel and renneberg win the race. The boy who traced their course climbs onto the raft with them, and receives the gold medal from Avery brundage, President of the olympic committee. Another German boy goes fo see the president. He is the coxswain who guided the coxed fours to victory. The Italians win the bronze medal. In the coxless fours, us and ussr take turns leading the race. Italy catches up to the Soviets and overtakes them 700 m from the finish. Then they attack the Americans, but the lake Washington picks up the pace. They dig in with their oars. The United States fake the gold, followed by Italy and the Soviet union. Dusk on the lake. The most classic of the rowing races begins - the eights. The formidable German scull of the ditmarsia ratzeburger club races to the finish at a pace of 48 strokes a minute. Canada and czechoslovakia are in second and third place. Then the United States, after 40 straight years of winning. [Taly comes in sixth. Livio berruti, a 19-year-old student, has been waiting for the 200m race. Berruti is shy, but with the obstinacy of the confident, he is certain he will make it fo the final he wins his quarterfinal in 20.8 seconds. He could have run faster, but he's first and doesn't overdo it berruli is a wise young man, who always looks ahead. Tomorrow he will have fo compete n the semifinal and the final in the semifinal, he faces two Americans - Norton and Johnson. He has no rivals going around the turn, as if impervious to centrifugal force. His stupendous equilibrium helps him overcome it. Coming out of the turn, berruti is clearly in the lead. With 20.05, he sets a new olympic record and matches the world record. This is the ritual that precedes the final race. Only livio berruti is calm, as he performs the duties of the host, showing his rivals the courtesy the rules of hospitality demana, as they worry about the race. The moment of truth has arrived. Berruti overtakes the victims of centrifugal force. An auspicious flight of doves, and victory. His time, 20.05. Twice in two hours, berruti has matched the world record. Lester carney is second, while Johnson and Norton faded. The French seye, third, seems to be admiring a prodigy. Berruti is himself even in his moment of triumph, as if unaware of having stopped time in a moment of extreme effort For the first ime in the history of the Olympics, an Italian has won a sprinting race. Of the 13 gold meaals won by Italy, this may be the most precious. In the late afternoon of September 10, in the piazza del campidoglio, a new chapter of the legend of marathon begins. The marathon of Rome is already legendary in our minds, as epic as the story of the soldier pheidippides, the messenger of victory, who ran 26 miles from marathon to Athens. When he arrived, he was barely able fo make his announcement, and aied of exhaustion. The first dramatic telegram in history. Men from all over the world take part in this epic event. We only know a few of their names. Sergey Popov and his teammates have practiced using zatopek's charts. I wonder what this Ethiopians name is. Everyone knows that no one can beat zatopek's time. The extraordinary humanity of the marathon parades before the dioscuri. White, yellow and black men throw themselves into the race, as if the finish line were here, rather than 42 km and 195 m away. The marathon leaves the ancient colosseum behind. The British Kelly is in the lead. The Soviets go over zatopek's chart in their minas. Their faith in him is absolute. Kelly is accompanied by the Irish messitt, the Belgian vandendriessche, and the Moroccans rhadil and saoudl and the unknown Ethiopian we saw earlier. His name is abebe bikila. He is barefoot Then there are only four men - Kelly, vandendriessche, rhadi, and the Ethiopian. He is 28 years old, married, with two children. He has spent his life running on the shewa plateaus. When he signed up for the marathon in Rome, he entered his time, even belter than zatopek's. But no one believed it Al the 20-km Mark, there are only two men in the lead. The first is a well-known runner. The second is he, abebe bikila. In Africa, it's the hour when gazelles and lions go fo arink. Abdesselam rhadi is an officer in the Moroccan army. He believes he's 30, though he's not sure, because he was an infant when his village was razed and his people dispersed. Abebe bikila is also a soldier, a member of the imperial guard of Halle selassie. He is the emperors messenger. Rhadi and abebe go into the night. But the gates of Rome light up for them. They enter a trembling tunnel of lights. The marathon follows the ancient appia. Al the 34-km Mark, abebe bikila lakes the lead, sets the pace. The rhythmic fall of his feet on the road is implacable. Periodically, a tremor goes through rhadi, he loses some ground, and recovers. Vorobyov loses faith in zatopek's chart. He consults Popov and oblains his permission fo do as he pleases. In third place is the New Zealander Barry magee. Abebe caresses the road. Rhadi pounds it, harder and harder. Athletes with no hope of catching up file under the arch of San sebastiano. Some are completely spent, but they trudge on. Anyone who completes a marathon is a winner. Only one kilometer from the finish line, rhadi is forced to allow abebe fo go on alone, info this fabulous night. From now on his name will be famous. The emperor will promote him. After 35 seconds, rhadi crosses the line. Abebe bikila is already a hero when magee arrives. And then the two soviers, vorobyov and Popov. They have beaten zatopek's time. And then many others. They all deserve fo climb onto the medalists' podium. Even this man, who spent his last ounce of energy to cross the line. From now on the Ethiopian is more famous than nurmi and zatopek. Even the athlete who arrives an hour later adas something to the history of the race of marathon. The grand olympiad is a mere memory. The heart-wrenching memory of a peaceful interlude, which from August 25 to September 11 of 1960 was the season of the world. Avery brundage speaks. 'May the Tokyo games also be a source of gaiety and Harmony.? The end
