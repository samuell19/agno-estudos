What's the matter? - Who's the new guy? - Forget it, Grace, I already tried. He's just been talking to little Miss Bartender for hours. - I think he said his name is Vince. Looks like a good catch, but too bad he's not biting. - Well you're just not giving him the right bait. - Ooh! - Hi, I'm Grace. I understand you met some of my friends. They're nice girls, but they're just the warm up act. - I see. I guess that makes you the main attraction? - Sweetie, you're new here, so why don't we just cut right to the chase. Whatever it is you're looking for, I'm the one. You're wasting your time with anybody else. - Well, thank you very much there Grace but I've been having a very nice conversation with the bartender here. - You're kidding me? - No, I just like a little mystery, a little intrigue. Something left to the imagination. - Honey, believe me, you're setting your sites way too low. You can do a lot better than that piece of... - Whoa whoa, you okay there? Are you alright? - You're right, he's gay. - I don't think she ever got any grace. - It's on the house. - What, I didn't do anything. - Sure you did. For a minute there you made me feel pretty damn good about myself. Intrigue huh? Talk like that could lead a girl on. - Fact is, I've been looking for someone like you for a long time. - Well then, I guess you found me. May I help ya? - You Charles Lakem? - Who wants to know? - My name's Whittaker, Vince Whittaker. What is it Charles? - It's nothing Ellen. What do you want Mr. Whittaker? - I know this is awkward sir, but years ago I read this article and I just wanted... - Yeah, okay hey, stop. Now look, I've had enough of you reporters. Now why don't you just leave us be? - I'm not a reporter sir. - Who's at the door Charles? - It's okay... - I'm a private investigator Mrs. Lakem. It's regarding your daughter. - Tell us what you know about our daughter. - I know this is very difficult for you both. I understand your eight year old daughter was kidnapped 16 years ago. - Yeah that's right. - Taken by her nanny. I know you had a ransom ready, but you never heard from the kidnappers or your daughter again. - Yes, and we don't need to be reminded again. - I found your daughter. I found her. Is this some kind of sick joke? You think this is funny? - Charles. - Sir. Catherine you wanna come up here? - Charles. - Sweetheart. - I know. Please, I don't want you getting your hopes up about this. This is not real. Go back, go back in the house. Please, let me deal with this. - These are your folks. - How do you do? The yard seems so much smaller. I remember having tea parties down by that tree. Wow. I really like the kitchen like this. It used to be so dark. This looks great. Do you remember when I hit my head on these patio doors because I thought it was open. And the doctor who came out, he had a big bushy mustache, right? - Yes, yes that was Dr. Reynolds. - Right. Do you still have Brandy? Of course not, she'd be dead by now. Mr, Whittaker, Brandy, she was my dog. She was... - A wire haired terrier. - No, she was a border collie, remember? - Listen, I don't know what kind of stunt you're trying to pull with us okay... - Charles, wait, let's just play this out, please. - I'm telling ya, she's Catherine. - Wasn't there a guest house down by the beach? You know, I could of sworn that it was right there. - It was. It burned down and we never rebuilt it. - Good, 'cause I thought I was going crazy. I remember what a terrible time you had trying to teach me how to drive the boat. You know I still can't do it. - Listen, I don't know what the two of you are up to okay. Charles please. - Ellen please, I cannot let them just waltz in here. Turn around and lift up your blouse. - What? Charles! - You heard me. Turn around and lift up your blouse. - Why, what's this about? - I wanna see your back. - Now just hang on a second here. Charles you're frightening her. - Our daughter has a very distinctive birth mark. - I don't know anything about that. - Of course you don't because I went through a great deal of trouble to keep that fact out of the newspaper. - Catherine, you don't have to do this, you know that. - Let me take a look at your back or I call the police. - Okay. - Oh my baby. Oh. - Mr. Lakem, can I get a word with you? - Yeah. Yeah. - Now the paper said you were offering $200,000. I'm assuming that rewards still in the books right? Okay. I just want to let you know I had a few extra expenses to go along with that. - Where'd you find her? - Well it took a lot of work, but I finally tracked her down in Arizona. Seems the kidnappers took her into Mexico, a few years later she ended up near Phoenix. She didn't want to get into with me but I do know the poor kids been kicked around a bunch of different foster homes. - Alright, alright. Listen, let me tell you something alright. I have the resources to check out every aspect of your story, okay? And believe me, I'm gonna do so. - That's not a problem. I'm staying downtown. You sort it out to your hearts content. I can wait. I'm just very happy for your family sir. - Now the painting was all I had for such a long time. Catherine, maybe we shouldn't do this right now. We could do it later. - It's okay. Come on. - This feels very strange, I'm embarrassed. - No! Don't be silly. I understand. No one would ever blame you for doing this. I only wished that Mr. Whittaker had found me sooner. It's Bojangles. You got me this one Christmas. - Do you remember Mr. Teddy? - No, sorry. - Oh he was that raggedy old pink Teddy. You never went anywhere without him. You wouldn't go to sleep without him. I just haven't seen him... - There's a lot I don't remember. - This was a mistake wasn't it? - No, no. I am so glad that you have kept it this way. You know what, it will help us pick up where we left off. - Well it was near your eighth birthday, do you wanna see a picture of it? - Yeah. All this, you've kept it just the way I remembered. - I know, I can change it. I don't expect you stay here. - Well, it is kind of for a little girl isn't it? You know, we have so much catching up to do. - You have no idea how I've prayed for this moment. You know, you really shouldn't have. This is too much. - Oh nonsense, we've just gotten started. Honey, you need an entire new wardrobe. - You know, you really didn't have to do this. - No, I do have to do it, for both of us. You never had a childhood and I never got to see you turn into a woman. - Yeah, but we'll never be able to get that back. - Right. That's why we have to make every minute count. Yeah. - I couldn't be happier for the two of ya. For the three of ya. - Thank you Howard. Thank you very much. But, I am gonna have that private investigator checked out. - The man who found Catherine? - Yeah, that guy Whittaker. I've got a detective agency in Arizona, they're gonna do a little run down on him. - So you still have your doubts? - Well, he checks out, then she checks out. - You know there's a lot at stake here Charlie. - Well you think I don't know that Howard? Why do you think I'm being so careful? I mean that reward money, that's a nice chunk of change. - No I mean Ellen. She's obviously accepted this girl as Catherine. - Well of course. I mean Ellen is my first concern. - If she should find out that it's not her, I don't know what she'd... I mean I can only think of what Ellen did the first time she lost Catherine and it's really... - Howard, Howard, we don't talk about that anymore. - Yeah. - Okay. Now you're not the only one that's concerned about Ellen's mental health. If there's something funny going on, it's better that we find out about it sooner rather than later. - You're absolutely right. - I can't believe you bought me a car. I love it. I absolutely love it. Who's car is that? - That's Howard, my financial advisor. You used to call him Uncle Howie. You remember him don't you? He'd be very disappointed if you forgot who he was. - Well it's, it's been a long time, mom. - Charles! Howard, look who I have here. - There she is, my little Catherine! - Uncle Howard? - You remember! I told Catherine that I would get a decorator and change the whole room around for her, but she decided to stay in the guest quarters. - Well you didn't think she was gonna stay in that damn shrine of yours did ya? - Don't be silly Charles. She can do whatever she pleases, she's 24 for heavens sakes. And I think staying in the guest quarters was the best thing anyway. Yeah, I'm not saying that staying in the guest quarters wasn't the best thing, I'm just saying why do you have to be so extravagant with her? - Well, honey, I don't think you really understand. She was raised by strangers. And god knows what went on there. - Yeah but, but just because she's my step-daughter doesn't mean that I don't feel the same way. But you know, you can't overcome your irrational fear by buying her a car. - I didn't buy her the car out of fear Charles. I bought it because I love her. Now you know, it is my money, and I can do with my money whatever I want. - Ellen, you can't buy her love. - I knew you had your own life in Arizona and I was just wondering if you'd like to share some of that with me. - Such as? - Oh, I don't know. Maybe tell me about school. Did you go to the prom? Did you have a special boyfriend? - You make it sound like I'm 15. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just meant is there someone that you're particularly interested in? - Yeah. - What's he like? - Well he's tall, good looking, terrific smile. - I'm not surprised, you deserve at least that. - But, he's also kind and gentle. I would do anything for him. He truly loves me. - That's the way it should be. I hope I get to meet him some day. - I'm sure you will. - So good. Let's go home. I'll make you some french toast for breakfast. Your favorite. Mmm, that sounds good. - You know, a case like this, it really gets under your skin. You know, you wonder, is there something I missed? Something I could of done? - Lieutenant, you know I, were you with the department back then because I don't remember you. - Yeah, I was in uniform. Was working liaison with the FBI. We were helping to track down Catherine's missing nanny. She was our prime suspect. We always figured that Lupe went down to Mexico. So how did you end up in Arizona? - Well I don't remember much. I was quickly placed in a foster home. Actually a whole string of them. - Yeah but even as a young child I mean, surely you realized you'd been kidnapped right? - Well Lupe had told me that I'd been orphaned. That mom and dad had been killed in a car accident. And then when I was 13 I ran away and ended up in Arizona. - Yeah, and it wasn't until Mr. Whittaker found Catherine that she even knew that we were still looking for her. And praying for her return. Look Lieutenant, I know you weren't in charge back then, but your supervisor thought it was a waste of time for us to offer a reward. He thought our daughter was dead. But as you can see, the reward is what brought her back to us. - Sorry that it took so long ma'am. We're gonna be very glad to get this case off our books. No look, what I meant was I'm relieved. Catherine's back safe and sound. That's what's important. - Come on darling. - Look, if you've got any lingering doubts about Catherine, my department can you help you with DNA testing. The most conclusive body of evidence... - Lieutenant, Lieutenant, maybe it's time that you reread your files 'cause our daughter was adopted okay? - Geez, I'm very sorry. - Yeah. - You're right. - I appreciate your concern, And I'm sure you can find your way out. Good bye. - No, Roger, no not again. Come on, I hate that. - Come on Julia, we've got to. Besides, the last ones weren't sexy enough. - Do you have to enjoy it so much? - What can I say, I'm a pervert. It's one of the many things you love about me. Come on, there you go. - Okay, come on, how about some full frontal hmm? Yeah, who's the shy one now? I'll trade ya. - Give me that. Careful, careful, it's only temporary. - You just stay focused and we're not gonna need it. People like them, they're just lucky to me that's all. We gotta make our own luck. I see a shiny brass ring out there just waiting to be grabbed. This time I'm not gonna let it go. Just a few more days, we get our hands on that reward money. - You know it's important to me too. So where do you wanna live? I say the east coast. We'll buy a little place, settle down, we'll have babies. Lots of babies. - I remember agreeing to the part where we practice making babies. Lots. - You know what, you're right. There's no need to rush. I mean we have a lifetime together. - Charles mentioned something about you having to sign papers, have you done that yet? - Well according to Howard, they're not ready. But Ellen's accountant will do anything she tells them. You know, I think he has the hots for her. - Old Uncle Howie, Ellen? Don't joke, people that age don't have sex. - Yeah, but we will won't we? When we're that old. - Think I can ever get tired of you? Uh uh, no way. Mmm. - Hey. - Just trying to make it as painless as possible for ya. - Is there anyway we can make this painless for Ellen too? I mean the woman is so sweet. - You're not getting all sentimental on me are ya? - No, it's just, I don't wanna see her get hurt again. I mean, she went through hell when she lost her daughter. - You gotta break a few eggs. - I mean imagine, for 16 years she waited. Holding onto a trust fund she set up for Catherine, just waiting for her to come home. God, that's real love. - Trust? - Yeah, most of the family's money is tied up in it. - Huh, you're kidding? Are those the papers you gotta sign? How much we talking about? - I don't know, millions I guess. - Hell, that changes everything. What do you mean? - The brass ring is looking more like gold baby. Bigger and brighter than I ever imagined. - A couple hundred thousand is plenty. Can't we just leave it at that. - Babe, we play this thing right, we'll end up with a hell of a lot more than that stinking reward. - Look Roger, as long as we have each other, I really don't care about the money. - Well luckily, I care enough for both of us. - They're all yours you know. I didn't hear you come in. - These were gifts your dad and I got you for your birthday and Christmas. - You know, you've really given me too much already. - They're old. I don't even think you want them. The house was especially empty at Christmas time. But I was always so sure you'd come back to me I wanted you to be able to enjoy every holiday you missed. Dolls, and toys, you know, kids stuff. - Here, why don't we call this our Christmas closet. You know, just a little reminder for both of us. - Why don't we have a party to celebrate your return? - You know, I think that would be just a little too much right now. But why don't we go to a nice restaurant with some friends? Okay? - What's it all mean Charles? - Well, it means that it checks out. - Everything? - The agency says that Vince Whittaker's legit, his story checks out, they even found copies of Catherine's foster home records, can you believe that? - Yeah, somebody did a hell of a job putting this together. - And the bottom line? - The bottom line Howard is, she's really Catherine. - Congratulations Charles. Ellen must be thrilled. - Our daughter's come home. - Fabulous news, fabulous. So I guess that closes the book on another one for you, huh Lieutenant? - Well actually, no. - We may have found Catherine but there's... - There's no statute of limitations on kidnapping. Congratulations Mr. Lakem. Best to your wife and your daughter. - Thank you Lieutenant. - Mr. Addison, pleasure as always. - Lieutenant. You were right to be suspicious Charles, but it's official now. - Well look Howard, I want you to get this money together. The reward money, and it's gotta be in cash. - Of course, no problem whatsoever. Worth every cent. - Okay, you bet. - This reward is the best money Ellen will ever spend. - Absolutely. - See ya later. Okay. - Excuse me Howard, I need Catherine for a minute. Come on darling. I want you to meet my dear dear friend Naomi. Naomi, isn't this exciting? - Yes, will you just look at her? She is absolutely gorgeous. - No. - And you can't take any of the credit for this Ellen. - Oh! - You know your mother is a saint. She never once gave up hope that you would be found. - I didn't you know. - Can I get a JD on the rocks please. - How'd you ever find her Mr. Whittaker? - Awe it was really tough but... Well done, you should be so proud of yourself. - Hey thank you, thank you very much. Appreciate that. - How long had you been working on the case? - It's taken quite a long time, but we got 'er done. - Hey it's really great, it's unbelievable. - Hey, thank you, appreciate that. - You know, that really is unbelievable. I wanna ask you about Arizona though. Arizona? - Yeah Arizona, I go up there fishing all the time. - Oh isn't that fascinating? - You know what, every summer me and a couple buddies, we head up to Saguaro Lake. You know where that is? - Nah, can't say that I do. - Well that's kinda strange, because that's near Phoenix, where you supposedly found Catherine. - Ah, well, you know, a lot of lakes up there. Even the Indians don't know all the names. What are you, her uncle or something? - Lieutenant Conroy, local police. - Ah. Oh off duty huh? What ya fishing for? Out there. What do you catch? Blue gill, pike? - You're a smart ass aren't ya Whittaker? Do you know what you've done? - I'm sorry, will you excuse me ladies? I see Mr. Whittaker and well, I'd just like to thank him again. You've brought her back from the dead. - Pardon me? - She's alive again. She's absolutely glowing. - I am you know. Go ahead darling. - Okay, it was nice to meet you. - Are you a licensed investigator or some sort of mercenary freelancer? - What difference is it to you? - I've got a high profile case to solve. Whoever kidnapped Catherine is still out there. So I figured you know, maybe you... - Mr. Whittaker. Mr. Whittaker. Lieutenant, I can't have you monopolizing our most important guest. There's a lot of people out there who want to meet him personally and thank him personally for everything that he's done. Now listen, Vince, I hate to have to do this to you, but you're gonna have to meet some of Ellen's friends. And believe me, she's not gonna take no for an answer. - Hey, no problem. - Hey, hey, where did you find this guy? - Actually lieutenant, he found me. Now, if you'll excuse me. Charlie, may I? - Absolutely Howard. Be my guest. - Thank you sir. - You enjoying yourself Uncle Howie? - This is a great night. I would imagine you're getting a little tired of people coming up and telling you just how great it is to have you back. In the next couple of days, after things settle down a bit, there's some paperwork we need to go over. - Oh is this the trust? You know about it? - Yeah, sure, mom told me. And I told her I don't want it. - What? - I mean, can't we just make it go away or something? - You want me to dissolve the trust? Catherine, there are millions in that account. Your mother had me set that up for you when she, just in case you ever... - Guess what, I've been found. - And your mother knows what you intend to do? - Howard, give her anything she wants. She's the most wonderful daughter in the world. - Certainly the most unselfish. - How much longer do I have to keep doing this? - What's that? Coming over here to see me? - You know what I mean. - Hey, you're doing a great job babe. Those relatives were buying it tonight. - Yeah, it's 'cause the new role suits me so well. Maybe too well. - Why, getting used to the money? - No, it's just that Catherine's childhood was a lot like mine. - What are you talking about? - I mean, losing my parents at a young age. Foster homes. - Hey, Julia, Catherine didn't have that childhood. Remember, we made it up. You are not Catherine. - I just relate to her, that's all. I mean Ellen couldn't of been nicer to me. I don't know, in some ways she's just, she's kind of like... - The mother you never knew? Please, you know you gotta spare me this high school babble. I can't have you getting all emotional on me right now. - You know what I mean. - Yeah, I always know what you mean babe. We just gotta keep cool. Now this won't be long. Just can't let eight months of work go down the drain. - You've been setting this up for eight months? - Yeah, more or less. What? - We only met in December. - What are you talking about? - I mean the whole thing was a lie. You knew about Catherine even before you met me, didn't you? I mean, that's why you singled me out. It wasn't because we found each other and we fell in love. It was because I could pass for her. - Okay. You're right, you're right. - You were gonna use me for the reward money and then what? You were gonna leave me, weren't ya? I mean you never had any intention... - Julia, listen to me! I can understand how you think it's like that, but you're wrong. Hey, of course you look liKe Catherine, and yes, I was gonna, like you said. But I swear to god, I didn't plan on falling in love with you. It just happened. I just couldn't help myself okay. - Roger... - No, listen to me. You can't leave me. You know that. Hey. You of all people know what it's like to be abandoned. You're not just gonna be walking out on me you're gonna be walking out on Ellen too. She's opened her arms for you. Hey. She's taken you back. She's accepted you without question, without judgment. Isn't that what a real mother would do? Hmm? You'll always have love, I promise. No one's ever gonna leave you again. Damn it, Julia. Julia, wait a second. Hey, hey, come on baby. Listen, I know what you want. - No you don't, you have no idea what I want. You think you can sweet talk me into anything. Look, the only reason I went along with this is because I thought you loved me. - I wanna put my arms around you right now. - No, okay don't. This is what I'm talking about. It's not just about you and me anymore. I told you. I don't wanna hurt Ellen. You're right, I get it. I see how important she is to you. - I used to be able to recall a vague image of my real mom. And now, all I see is Ellen. This wonderful lady treats me like her own daughter. I know Catherine's birth date, but I don't know my own. Until tonight, I never had any kind of party. You can't know what this means to me. - I'm sorry. You're so right. You're right, you're right. - Ellen's offering me a childhood. A whole life I never knew. And what are we planning to do? Rip her off for a couple hundred thousand? - Well let's drop the whole thing. Let's stop right now. Forget the money. Let's just pack up and get out of here. - You mean that? - I mean it. I love you. If the only way to prove it is for us to leave, then so be it. - You would do that for me? - I'd do anything for you. Come on, let's get out of here. We have to leave your car though. Well we can't take it because that's like stolen property. - So you want me to leave without saying goodbye? - Hey, we have two options here. We finish what we planned or we just bail right now. - Either way I'm gonna hurt her. - Don't worry, Ellen's gonna get over it. She did before. - Last time she tried to kill herself. Look, okay, is there any way that we can just let her down easy? - Well, if we finish this like we planned, I think you should make the decision of how best to handle her. - Me? Really? You'd let me make the decision? - Absolutely, your decision alone. Fair enough? Hmm? You're gonna learn, I'm the one who's always there for you, no matter what happens. Okay? Thanks babe. Come on, let's go. - Hey, hey you can't park there. - I'll keep that in mind. Is Mr. Lakem here? You got an appointment? - Yeah, he's expecting me. - Who should I say is calling? - Nobody's calling. Vince Whittaker. - Oh my god, you're Mr. Whittaker. I'm sorry. I'm Gena, Mr. Lakem's secretary. What you did, you're a hero. Mr. Lakem never expected to see his daughter again. He's a changed man since he came back. - Well that's good. Is he... - Gina. Hey Vince. How are ya? I see you recovered from our little soiree last night. - Yeah. - Hey, no more calls for a while, alright? Come on in. What a dump. - Hey, it's a construction site, what do you expect? Of course you wouldn't understand. You never worked a real job in your entire life have ya? - Hey, no one ever gave me anything on a silver platter either. - Yeah right, I knew from the moment I met you, you didn't have a freaking clue what it takes to make a living. Oh yeah, this is perfect, just perfect. Okay. Here ya go. Easiest money you'll ever earn. - Finally. What the... Where's the rest of the money? - That's half the reward money. - I can see that. What you trying to pull? - Jobs not over yet. - Of course not, but we agreed if... - We agreed that you and the girl finish the job. You get the papers signed, then the job is over damn it. - Lakem, you're not exactly in a position to be dictating new terms to me okay? One phone call to Lieutenant Conroy and I... - Yeah, one phone call to Conroy and we're all nailed. So you make sure you stay away from Conroy. That cop's been sniffing around. And don't give him any reason to take a look at your phony files. - The report, they would've had to. Huh, everyone bought it right? Why are you trying to screw me here man? - For Christ sake, you know, I'm a respectable business man. You think I'm gonna take a chance with this thing hanging over my head of screwing you? - Okay. Since we're moving the goalpost, I got one for you. You lied to me. Those papers to be signed were for Catherine's trust fund. There's gotta be millions in that account. - So? - So, the deal's based on false information. The way I see things, the work we're doing for you, is worth a hell of a lot more than that stinking reward. - Really? - Really. Julia and I figure out, the risk we're taking, is worth, I don't know, 750 grand, each. Think about that. - Now you listen to me you son of a bitch and you listen good. You're gonna do what I tell you to do when I tell you to do it. Now you take that money, you get those papers signed. Then you get the rest. Do you understand? Huh? I think I heard a crash. - Yeah well thanks there Mr. Lakem. Your generosity is like nothing I've ever seen. Have a good day. - And you too. Gina. He shorted us, he only gave us half the money. - Baby calm down. Tell me what happened. - Well he said he's not gonna give us the other half until we sign the trust papers. Why the hell should I believe him? - Roger, why can't we just leave it at that? I mean, come on, even half is more than enough for us. - No, no babe, it's not enough. And how do I know how much that bastards really got? Hey what's up man, how ya doing? Respected businessman my ass. Your ass is mine Lakem! - Sauce pans? - In the pantry honey. - Pantry. - It's right back there. I know it'll take you a while to remember everything. - Mom what is it? - Do you ever notice how the wind just blows the shadows of the clouds across the ocean? It was like that when you were taken from me. I felt as though I had my heart ripped out of my very being. You know, every time I think about how painful it was for me, I have to remind myself of how terrible it was for you. Whatever I suffered is nothing compared to a child losing her parents in the same day. - Ellen, I'm here now. Okay let's just forget about everything else. - That's what I used to think. I used to pray for that. I wanted nothing more than to have all the memories erased. And then I realized that I really have to keep those memories alive because it makes every day with you that much more precious. What is it sweetie? - No, it's nothing, really. I'm fine. - You know, all that's happened, I really feel like it's created this wonderful bond between us. All that time we were apart Catherine, you never left my heart. - You've been so honest about your feelings, but there are, there are things that I need to tell you about me. - No, whatever you had to do to survive, it's okay. It's all forgiven. - Ellen, there's no easy way to tell you this... Then don't. It's all just gonna unfold slowly. We have a lifetime. - What was that? - Just the garage doors honey. It's Charles. Hi. - Hey. Damn vendors screwed up another bid. Can't get these people to do anything right. Well just relax darling and have a drink. - That's what I'm doing. What are you two up to? - Oh, just catching up on 16 years of girl talk. You wanna join us? - Keep it up girls. - He seems pretty upset. Did an important business deal fall through? - You know, it seems like every business deal he's planned to do falls through. But don't worry, it doesn't affect you and me. Hello ladies. Don't worry, I'm not from immigration. Which one of you's Maria? Vince Rogers, Internal Revenue Service. - I pay my taxes. - That's what everyone says. Don't worry, this is not regarding your taxes. Although I did have a hard time tracking you down. I understand you used to work for the Lakem family. - Yes. - I'm gonna be upfront with you Maria. We're looking for background information on Charles Lakem's financial situation. Thought you might wanna help us out. - What can I do mister? I don't know nothing. - Oh come on Maria, sharp gal like yourself? I'm sure you kept your eyes open. Did you ever see Mr. Lakem involved in any shady financial dealings? - I don't know. Mr. Lakem was a man who kept to himself mostly. He stayed down at the guest house, and that's where he kept his office. - Oh really? He never declared he was doing business out of his house. Did you see large sums of money or a safe in the office? - I didn't see anything. I never went by the guest house. But you know what, Lupe did. - Lupe, the nanny. She was a very pretty woman wasn't she? - I don't wanna get into no trouble mister. - Come on Maria. She looks very attractive to me. - She was. But you know what, it's unfair, she's not here to defend herself. - Oh, I see. Did Ellen know her husband and the nanny were... - Look here mister, Mrs. Lakem was a good friend of mine. A very nice woman. But that husband of hers... - Right right, we've heard that story before. Okay Maria, thank you. I will check your story out. - Hey, you talk to Lucas yet? - Lucas Thurmond, the gardener, next on my list. For assisting with an IRS investigation, you don't have to file a tax return next year. - Oh really? - Just kidding. Don't forget to file now. Hey Lieutenant. Yeah, what a surprise. If I didn't know any better, I'd think you're following me. - I figured you'd be gone by now. - Yeah well... - Didn't you get your reward? - As a matter of fact I did. - Waiting for the check to clear? - You got that right. In the meantime, I thought I'd just enjoy Sarasota. Maybe check out that circus museum. - What's of interest to you in the Baylor Hotel? - Just thinking about changing hotels. Upgrade, something suitable for a hero. You know what I mean? - Look, Whittaker, you're not licensed to work down here are you? - Is that what this is all about? Feeling guilty about screwing up the big case? Thinking I'm gonna step on your toes? Lieutenant, as soon as I get my money I'm gone man. Florida is too hot and too humid man. You guys got too many bugs down here, know what I mean? - This is an active federal kidnapping case. Stay out of my way or I'll slap 'em on you so fast. - You better stay the hell away from me. - Anybody home? Ellen! Ellen! Ellen! Yeah! - I'll come back later! No, come now! No it's a business thing, it's not a good time! All time is good! Come on! I drew up the dissolution papers that you requested Catherine. Now essentially this terminates the blind trust your mother has set up for you. You're turning your back on a fortune. - Howard, you and Charles always thought I was crazy to have that trust written up. - Look, I followed your wishes to the letter. - Of course you did. As you always have and as you will right now. Catherine's a big girl, she can make her own decisions. You know, I tried to talk her out of it, but you know how stubborn the Lakem women are. - Uncle Howie, I don't care about the money. I mean I'm finally in my real home. What else matters? - Alright, so you realize what this does? You'll have no further claim on it except through inheritance and I cannot begin to tell you the tax liabilities we're gonna incur because. - Okay, okay, then don't begin. - Alright Catherine. I need you to sign here and here. - Howard, lighten up. Life is short, have a margarita. - Mr. Thurmond. Who is looking for him? - Whoa, hang on now sir. Don't do anything rash. - Who are you? Vince Rogers, Rogers, Seagrums, and Daniels. - So, you're a lawyer. - My law firm is handling a class action suit for wrongful termination. I have an affidavit here sir that says that you were gainfully employed by Mr. Charles Lakem. - What do you want with me? - Well, I understand that you were terminated without just cause sir, is that correct? - Mr. Lakem fired my ass for no reason? Yes sir he did. And when this case goes to trial, you're in line for a very large settlement. - Oh. What I got to do Mr. Rogers? - Well Lucas, may I call you Lucas? - Yeah, go ahead, call me Lucas. - Well my firm has taken sworn statements from other employees that were fired by Mr. Lakem. I just saw Ms. Maria Gonzalez. And what I need from you though is background. How did Mr. Lakem conduct his business affairs? - So you're looking for dirt on the man? - Well we lawyers get carried away with your fancy terms there, but yes. You put your finger right on it. We're looking for dirt, if you will, on Mr. Lakem. - That dirty dog fired me. For no reason. And I was the Lakem's gardener for over 10 years. Listen, would you mind if I wet my whistle? - I'll do you one better than that. Let my firm take you out for a drink or two. It's on us, our expense. - Now you're talking. - Great. Just put that away and we'll take my car okay? - Alright. Awe there, that tastes better. - Yes it does. Now I heard in those days, Lakem had an office in a guest house. - Yeah I know. He was sometimes bring me in the cellar. That's why he stayed there. There was always a fight about money... - There you go Lucas. Let's focus on the money. Now shady guy like that always operates with cash on hand. Did you ever see any lying around or maybe some other valuables? - My tools. - Your what? - You know, I couldn't work anymore. When he fired me he kept all my tools. - Okay, alright. Your tools. What about a safe or a lockbox up in the main house? - This guy could look straight through you. He didn't even see ya. Mrs. Ellen, she was alright. Till his wife, poor Catherine. You know she tried to kill herself? Where the hell is this other beer? - Don't you worry, I'm not gonna let you go dry here. Now we're talking about Lakem. - Thank you. - Okay now, we're talking about Lakem. Cash reserves, money stashed away. - He never let me get down to the basement, never. - There's a basement in the main house? - No, no, the guest house. - That doesn't do me any good 'cause that burned down. - Uh uh, the basement. You can't burn down a basement. This year, I had no work, no tools anymore. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no tools, no work. I get it. - You see, without me the whole place grown out. Bunches of weed, breaker boxes. I figured out I could clean the place in exchange... - You get your tools back. Right. - When did that happen? - Two, three month after little Catherine... - He didn't want your help? - He put a shotgun on me. - He fired at you? Yeah strange. He wouldn't let me anywhere near this basement. - You know what, thank you very much there Lucas. Appreciate that. We're gonna get you a nice settlement okay? - Cheers Lakem. - Check please. Thank you Lucas. - I love this one. You look so pretty in that. - Oh, thanks. - Really. - Oh here, here's a good one of you and Howie. - Oh no it's not. Look at him. It looks like he had a little too much to drink. That one's getting. - Oh my god, these are so funny. - I know, I know. - Did he ever ask to kiss you? - No honey, he would never do that. - Well he wanted to you know? - Really? - He did. - I think I've had enough of that. - That was only your second glass. - I know, I know. But my doctor said to me that alcohol really interferes with the medication, so. - Well what exactly are you taking? - Oh my gosh, anti-depressants, sedatives, sleeping pills, you name it. - Oh. - I just think that now that you're back, I can get off everything. - Good. - Yeah. - Well you'll be okay. - I know. - Yeah. Come on. Here we go. - Done. - Mom are you okay? - Yeah I'm okay honey. I just have this headache. I think it's the wine. - Well what can I get you? - Nothing, nothing sweetie. I've got enough medication in me, trust me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Well that's odd, that's Charles. He said he was gonna work late tonight. You know, now that you're back, everything's gonna settle down. You are the best thing that's ever happened to us. Charles! Charles honey what is it? What, what, something at work? - Ellen go up to your room. What? - You don't wanna hear what I've got to say. - No, please. Charles, you're upsetting Catherine. - Oh I'm upsetting Catherine huh? Do you have any idea what this young woman has done to upset our lives? Please, you don't have to... - Sit down and shut up! You're not going anywhere! - Charles, what's the meaning of this? What are you doing? - I tried to explain... - Don't you even speak to her you bitch! That's right, this bitch. Do you have any idea what she's done? Do you? She's been out there doing the private investigator. And you wanna know why? Because the two of them have been scamming us! And you wanna know why they're scamming us Ellen? For the money. Here. Put these in your damn photo album. Found those in Mr. Whittaker's motel room. Right after he left town with our money. - I just don't believe this. The private investigator confirmed that she... None of this matters Charles, none if it matters. - Don't be so naive Ellen. The whole thing is a fake. The two of them have been deceiving us right from day one! Isn't that right miss? What's your name, huh? What's your real name? - Ellen, you have to believe me please. You have to. - You don't have to tell him anything. How dare you talk to your daughter like this? Leave her alone! - Don't you get it woman? She is not our daughter. You're an imposter, get out! - Please, I tried to! I wanted to tell you things about me! - Charles... - You stay back! Get out of our house, get out! That was good. - How could you do this! - Listen, it was to give her a full confession. Didn't Roger tell you? I said get the hell out! - What are you talking about? - Just stick to the plan okay. - Let me tell her the truth please. - Money in the shed. Honey. Honey come on, get up. Come on. She's gone now. Let's get you all settled in. I'm gonna take care of it. Go on. - Oh no, Catherine. - Honey, honey come on. It's okay now. It's okay. I'm gonna get your pills. You need your medication. It's okay honey. I know how upset you must be. This will have you right in no time. Here you go, come on, take these. Here's you medication, come on. Come on take these, come on. Here ya go, come on. There ya go, just take 'em. That's it. Perfect, yeah. Just relax now. Just lay back, relax. Because we're gonna go back to the way things used to be before Catherine. I just want you to put her out of your mind. Just put her out of your mind. She's no longer in our lives. - I don't feel good. - You're just upset honey, that's all. Just relax, come on, just relax. - Oh Charles, I wanna call a doctor. I just wanna call... - No, no, no. Can't let you do that honey. - I want! - Easy does it. Now we can't have you doing that now can we? There ya go. Easy, easy, easy. - What have you done? - Oh no. It's not what I've done, it's what you've done. You made a mistake honey. You've taken an overdose of barbiturates. Again. Oh my god. I wish I would've been there to stop ya. Howard, it's Charles, just leaving the construction site. I'm on my way home, take me about an hour. Listen, there's been some developments regarding Catherine that I think we should discuss right away. So let's meet at the house. I'm a little late, let yourself in. Good, that's it, I'll see ya then. - Oh god. Roger, you have no idea what just happened at the house. - Lakem told Ellen everything right? - You knew? You knew what he was gonna do? But you said that I could be the one who was gonna tell her! - He wanted to play it out that way. - Well then why didn't you tell me? - Hey Julia, the idea was for you to be shocked, to respond naturally. I'm sure your reactions were perfect. - No, but you have no idea. I mean if you had only seen the way Ellen was... - Forget about Ellen, this is not about Ellen anymore. You know what, and forget the reward money too. - Why, has something happened? - You bet it has babe. We are gonna be rich. Filthy rich baby, filthy rich. That 200 grand's chump change. We're gonna have everything we ever wanted. You understand me, everything. I promise you. - Roger, can we just get in the car and go? - We can't run away now. Don't you see? I got that bastard right where I want him. - Well if there's a change in plans. I think I ought to be in on this. - You scared me there man. - What are you so jumpy about? - What happened inside? You two said that... - Oh yeah, well your girlfriend here almost screwed the whole damn thing up, but I guess you can say my wife fell for it. So should we conclude our little business deal? - You can forget that reward money man. - Oh yeah? Why? You two working for charity now? - I think we deserve a bigger slice. Maybe the whole damn pie. - Oh. Roger, you improvising again? - Nah, I'm just digging around the old guest house. Seen some of your handy work down in the basement. This time I really did find Catherine. - What do you mean found her? - It's what I mean. - You're guessing. You've got nothing. - Nothing? You recognize this? - Oh my god. Catherine, where is she? - Right where he left her. She's dead. With the nanny beside her. - You? You kidnapped your own child? - Yeah, how could you? I'm thinking, no matter how much money you've got... - You dumb bastard. Now why couldn't you have just stuck with the plan, and taken the reward money? Get rid of it. Now move. I needed the cash for my company. That ransom money was gonna cover my overruns. And if my stinking selfish wife, would of helped me out at the time, none of this would of been necessary. - I saw the room you left them in, the door was locked from the outside. - So what genius? - I just wanna know, did you wait until they died before you bricked them in? - You let your own daughter die like that just to protect yourself? Your own flesh and blood? - Well not exactly, after all, she was adopted. - You son of a bitch! - Shut up! Get down there! - Hey, hey, come on man. Look, I've done everything you wanted me to do. You and me we can work something out. Just, let the girl go. - You should of thought of that before you got so greedy. - Come on, she's nothing! Let her go! - Whoa boy, you are a piece of work. Still pretending you care about her. He ever tell you how he got the job? Sent me a bunch of pictures of different girls. I'm the one that picked you as the best match for Catherine, not lover boy here. But I'll tell you one thing, and I gotta give him credit. Whatever he did to keep you involved must've been good. - That's not true! - Shut up! - It's all crap! - Now let's get it over with! Roger whatever! - Get down there man! Shut up! - Ellen! Ellen! Ellen! Ellen! Are you okay? Ellen I got you. Ellen I'm here now. Come on, come on. - Oh god. - You're okay. - Julia. Oh my god no! - You bitch! - Stay away from me! No please! No don't! - So, Roger's not here to help you now. Just you and me. - No don't! Don't kill me please! No! No! God, Howard! - Ellen! What the hell happened! - You stay with her, I'm gonna call an ambulance! - Ellen, god! What's going on? - Hi, police? It's an emergency. Mom you're gonna be okay. Don't worry. Don't worry, it's okay. - Lieutenant. Charles phoned me tonight and he asked me to meet him up here. Obviously he wasn't calling from work like he said. - Yeah, obviously. - And I swear, I have no idea why the hell he would want me to come up here for this. - He wanted you to be the one to find Ellen's body. - Hmm, son of a... - It's been my experience these things usually involve money. - Well Charles was a walking financial disaster. His business was always on the verge of bankruptcy. - Yeah, but the wife's side of the family, they were loaded right? - For all the good it did him. Ellen was reluctant to throw good money after bad. And she was very firm on what was hers and what was his. - That must of really called him. - Yeah. - So what changed? Look a guy doesn't get up one day and decide to fake his wife's suicide unless something changed. New insurance policy, what? - It was a trust. When Catherine dissolved the trust, all the monies were diverted back to Ellen's account. If Ellen died, Charles, he stood to inherit everything. - Okay, alright. Well whatever Lakem's plans were, something went very wrong. So, what are we talking here, how much money? - 14.3. - Million? For that kind of money I'd kill somebody. Well I'm almost finished. I've got a pretty good idea what happened, but you know what? There's one thing that puzzles me the most. That huge trust fund, you just what, walked away from it? - Lieutenant, I couldn't accept that money because it didn't belong to me. That was my mother's money. And I never wanted her to ever think that that was the reason I came back. - That's hard to believe. Excuse me sir. - What? - You said you wanted to be notified. - What? - The motel manager said Vince Whittaker checked out this morning and his rental cars been returned. - But you know where Whittaker is right now, don't you? - No, why would I? - Because the other night at the party, it seemed to me you and him made a real nice couple. A handsome guy like that, you, him. - I was grateful that he found me. Nothing more, nothing less. - I don't know, I think maybe the two of you... - That is enough! Ellen, Ellen... - No! You leave my daughter alone! I know why you're badgering her. We all do. You failed. You failed. You've been completely humiliated... - Ellen. - What? No. - No, no, Mr. Whittaker. Mr. Whittaker, an outside investigator, he came in here and he solved this case. You couldn't do it. And that's just driving you crazy. - Honestly Mrs. Lakem, no. - Catherine saved my life tonight. That's all that needs to be said. - Well I'm really sorry. Would you ladies feel more comfortable if I left a couple of my men here overnight? - It's a little late for that lieutenant. - Goodnight Mrs. Lakem. Goodnight Catherine. - I'll show him out Ellen. And I'll be here as long as you need me. This way lieutenant. - We do whatever we have to do to survive. - Yes we do. - Catherine, I'm gonna see to it that no one ever comes between us again. - Mom. - Ready dear? - Well darling, let's go home. I'll make you french toast for breakfast. Your favorite. - Sounds great mom.
