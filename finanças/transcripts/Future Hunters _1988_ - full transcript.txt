NARRATOR: It is the year 2025, almost 40 years since the great holocaust. A once proud world has been reduced to ruin, famine, and despair in the bitter aftermath of war. Now mankind's last frail hope lies in a fabled object which has the power to turn back time, and perhaps to undo the evil which has befallen the world. That object is the spear of Longinus, the spear which pierced the body of Christ on the cross, and which holds the very power of creation itself. In a desperate attempt to find the spear and journey back through time to prevent the holocaust, a small band of rebels has crossed deep into the forbidden zone. A wasteland ruled by the cruel warlord Zaar. Now the lone survivor in this deadly quest is a man called Matthew and he is truly mankind's last and only hope. Yay! I got him, I got him! Go! Take him. ( groaning ) Matthew, the temple is surrounded! You cannot succeed in this. Give up! Accept death, Matthew! It's been coming to you for a long time! ( gunshots ) Call in the tanks. Scorpion, come in. Come in, Scorpion. Proceed to the temple. Come. Michelle, it's getting late. We can come back another time. I don't want to miss my ballgame. You didn't have to come. I told you that this is very important to me. I have exams coming up and I need to gather as much information as I can. Yeah, yeah. Now it's exams. God, this painting must be hundreds of years old. You know, Michelle, I wish you'd really make your mind up. Since your father died, you seem to have lost your sense of direction. Here you are pushing yourself to be the greatest anthropologist of all times. And then tonight you're gonna be rushing off to open the diner, and all for nothing. What, with the kind of money your father left you? Isn't that why you left the Marines and came running back to me? Come off it, Michelle, you know that's not true. ( bikes revving ) Hey, look at what we got here. ( groaning ) Get off me! ( screams ) All right, baby. We're gonna do it real fine. ( screams ) All right. Do it, boss. Come on, boss, save me some of that. ( screams ) Bitch! Lost your bike, brother? What's up, bro? What bunch you with? Where is your fucking bike? Let her be. Let her be. No fucking way, bro. We don't take orders from somebody we don't even know. ( groans ) Come on! ( groaning ) Slade, no! He saved our lives. Let's get him to the hospital. ( engine starts ) Where are we? A few miles from LA. What's LA? This is the spear that pierced the one called Christ. Through the ages, only evil powers possessed it. It must be joined with its shaft and held forever in open view where its dark powers are broken. But tell no one. The evil ones will be hunting you. Hightower will know. What are you talking about? What date is it? June 12, 1986. Holocaust, soon. What? I'm from another time. You must finish what I cannot. Huh. ( coughs ) Who is Hightower? MATTHEW: Hightower... Seek him in your place of knowledge. Slade, he's dead! He's dead. Oh, my God. Slade, he's dead. What is it? Something I said? No. I just can't stop thinking about yesterday. It's like a nightmare. Look, Michelle, if you don't believe me, at least believe the cops. The guy was crazy. Easy for you to say. I saw it. I saw that guy turn into a heap of ashes when he was stabbed with that thing, the spearhead. I saw it, Slade. It was your imagination. Things were happening so fast. You were in shock. Don't do this to yourself, Michelle. All right, I was in shock, but it was real. The guy came out of nowhere and he saved our lives! And that is not my imagination! What's this all about? He said he was going to bed, I was putting him to sleep. I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. Where have you been? I had something to do. Guess what? I got the job. Assistant mechanic, Rowling's Crop Dusting Airways. That's nice. Is that all you've got to say? Take a look at this and the pictures here. I got them from the library this afternoon. That is the spearhead, all the stories are there, all of it. And the name the guy gave us, Hightower, he did the research on all of those articles. You still won't believe it? Mythology legend, so what? You go to the library and you find a book about Longinus and the spear. I didn't see anything about a man from another time. I'm taking that on faith, I guess. After all, the man died saving our lives. I don't think he'd do that just to tell us lies. I'm closed! Look, the guy was crazy or on something, he had to be. Do you think I'm crazy? No. That's not what I'm saying. I just told you I'm closed! Look, guys, I just opened the shop a couple of hours ago and I don't have much money. Relax, we're not interested in your money. You got something else we want. What? You've got the head of a spear. Where is it, bitch? Please. Stubborn, aren't you? Demonstrate for them, Hans. ( laughs ) It's gonna be better for both of you, and far less mess, if you'll both just cooperate. For God's sake, Michelle, would you just give them the fucking thing?! ( car honking ) Oh, yeah! Right. ( indistinct chatter ) Hey, Michelle, come on! ( knocking on door ) We will be back. I'm not done here yet. Hey, Michelle! Hey, asshole, can't you read? She's closed. Come on, man, it's closed. Let's go! All right! Let's go to the firehouse! All right, let's go! Well? Do you believe me now? Michelle. Professor Hightower is at the University. How much time could it take? Absolutely not. I do not want to pursue this. Professor Hightower is my associate here. When I heard from him last... he was... in Hong Kong pursuing one of his fanciful dreams. I presently... lost contact with him. It's not uncommon. He forgets all else when he's on one of his journeys. Perhaps I could help you out. You said the dying man gave you an object or something. Do you have it with you? Yeah, it's right here. Slade... Come on, Michelle, he has to see it to tell us what it is. For Christ's sakes, we have to trust him that far. It's the head of a spear. Hmm. Show me. Yes. I could take it to him. I'll be joining him soon. No, it was entrusted to us. I understand, I understand. Well... since your need for confidentiality is so great, I could have Hightower get in touch with you. When we do find him. Okay. Here's my address. Thank you. Uh, Mr. Slade, is that your first or last name? Last. I prefer to use it, my first name is Quendas. ( laughs ) Would you like to leave your address also? No, I'm-- I just drove in with her, I'm not involved. Hey, let's stop for some coffee and a sandwich, huh? I'm starving. How do you like your coffee, with or without company? Huh? They've been with us the last few miles, catching up and dropping back. What the hell? Damn it. They've got guns! Do you believe me now, Slade? Just give it to them, huh, just do it! Just get rid of it, man! Just throw it to them, huh? Who is them, Slade? This could make my career. What are you saying? I'm not saying anything, sweetheart. I'm going to Hong Kong with or without you. I will find Hightower. God damn it! Okay, okay, maybe we will go, huh? Brake! Oh, fuck! Slade, my friend. Good to see you. It's been a long time. This is Michelle. Hi, Michelle. SLADE: Have you checked up on that address I gave you? LIU: Yes. And I tracked Hightower to the Forbidden Pagoda of the Silverfox. But from there, he disappeared. SLADE: What's this Silverfox? LIU: He guards the pagoda with his life. We should go there if we really want to find out what happened to Hightower. ( speaking in foreign language ) ( speaking in foreign language) Slade, this guy is a kung fu master. He said this place is for the dead. If we stay here, we're both dead. Come on, let's go. This is my only chance to see this place. I'm leaving tomorrow. And we're not looking for any trouble. Besides, I was in the Marines. Slade, we better go now, okay? Come on. Come on. ( grunting ) ( screams ) ( knuckles crack ) ( gunshot ) Who the hell was that?! He saved my life! Why did he run away? Don't be stupid, my friend. That shot was for you. Nothing. Just a waste of time. Hey, you're one hell of a fighter. Where'd you ever learn that stuff? My grandfather taught me. He was a Shaolin monk. ( knocking on door ) ( continuous knocking ) Who is it? Telegram for you, ma'am. ( continuous knocking ) You've got to sign for it. ( groaning ) You have something of ours, but you have nothing to fear if you give it to us. ( speaking in foreign language ) I have to agree with my friend. He thinks you will enjoy some time alone with us. Perhaps... it wouldn't be quite so painful as you might imagine. But on the other hand... Michelle? Michelle! Move! ( grunting ) ( groaning ) Who are you, you son of a bitch?! Talk! You son of a bitch, talk! ( groaning ) I only work for them. Believe me! I had nothing to do with it. They need it. Did what, huh? ( groaning ) Talk! They took the Hightower. ( groaning ) Where to, huh?! Where to?! You little shit, talk! ( groaning ) Liu, Slade, that's enough! That ought to refresh your memory, huh?! Talk, you bastard! Talk! Okay. He's in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is a big place. Come on. Their expedition was last in Manila. On their way to the Venus Valley, they were intercepted. What the hell is a Venus Valley? I've heard of that place before. It is said to be fiction, not fact. It's said to be located somewhere in Southeast Asia inhabited by Amazon female-like warriors called Tassadars. They're a newly founded tribe. What's their connection to the spear? Or Hightower? Hightower may have just discovered a connection and gone there. We have to go to Manila. Don't you think we've had enough? No, Slade. I think we've just begun. The discovery of a lost civilization, the true power of the spearhead. There's no stopping. Are you with me? ( knocking on door ) What? ( knocking continuously ) Who is it? Whoa! I have a message for you, sir. I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to wake you up. I'm sorry, please. I was having a dream, that's it, I was having a bad dream. Slade, what the hell is going on? What's the matter with you? I'm sorry. Thank you, sir. There you go. It's an invitation from Dr. Fielding. Dr. Fielding here in the Philippines? Yeah. He did say he'd be joining Professor Hightower, didn't he? He's inviting us to have dinner with him at his villa outside of town. He'll be sending a car to meet us, says we should bring the spearhead as he has important information about Hightower. How did he know we were here? How the hell should I know? Something's wrong. You have been a good and faithful lieutenant, and there will be a place for you in the new order when all the sub-humans of this cesspool called humanity are eliminated! It will be a far better world. Now that we have Hightower, the continued existence of these two meddlers must be dispensed with the instant the spearhead is secured. The nuclear arsenals of the world, the missiles, the aircraft, the satellite controls will soon be ours! All our operatives stand ready and we will unleash that power to cleanse the earth forever of this human pollution! Now we have a long and arduous journey to the Venus Valley. Your expertise will be essential. Carry out my command. It shall be done. I don't understand. Why couldn't he have come here? Where'd you hide it in Hong Kong? In the toilet tank. Slade, that's the man from the diner. Oh, shit. All right. Slade. Hello, Mr. Slade, I'm Conrad Bauer, Dr. Fielding's aid. I've come to drive you to his home. Uh, my-- my friend, Michelle. Charmed. I'm afraid we're gonna have to postpone this evening, we've had a change of plans. Oh? I'm not feeling well. Yeah, yeah, and maybe he can come here or... we could do this tomorrow? That's just not possible. It must be tonight, and right now. Yeah, I... I guess I expected you to say that. Oh! ( people scream ) Keep running, Michelle! ( groaning ) Shit. ( groans ) ( groans ) ( Michelle screams ) Go on, step on it. This guy's a fool to follow us. ( groaning ) ( groans ) ( groaning ) ( groans ) In pain, Mr. Slade? Leave the weapon where it is. It won't do you any good to kill me, unless of course you want to kill them. Your lady friend and I don't believe you've met this gentleman. Allow me to introduce Professor Hightower. Why don't you just finish the job? You've got all the cards. Yes, I know. But I have a sporting heart. Now that we have what we sought, a little bit of a game is permissible. Get the men ready. You fool! Only the shaft is in the Venus Valley. No one knows where the head is. ( chuckles ) There's no reason you should go to your grave with empty hopes. Show him, Bauer. No. No! ( laughs ) God Almighty, no! We've wasted enough time here. Come, Bauer! Auf wiedersehen. You've got to stop them! You must! They must be stopped! ( groans ) No, no. That'll spoil our fun. ( groans ) You've got to get the spear out of their hands. They will use it to destroy mankind. You must place it out in the open, in the light, where its dark powers will be broken. Don't you understand?! He's a Nazi! Fielding is a Nazi! ( grunting ) ( screaming ) ( laughs ) Farewell, my friends! Well... That's it. Maybe not. I didn't know you knew how to fly one of these. Can you? Yeah, well, it's been a few years, but how tough can it be, right? Just like riding a bike, you never forget. What's this? Their flight plan. 110, 3 hours, max speed. This thing has a range of 875 miles, 253 max speed. What the... What is it? 759 miles to an island that's been sketched on this map. I don't know. What don't you know? I don't know if I wanna do this. Just for you. Well, I, uh... guess we're through the worst of it. What kind of takeoff was that? Hey, we're up here, aren't we? Hey... I'm getting a transmission. FIELDING: ( on radio ) Bravo, Mr. Slade. You're one of the rare species of the cat family. But even cats, Mr. Slade, do not survive their nine lives. Look under the cushion of the co-pilot's seat. A precautionary measure. ( chuckles ) The controller is with me. Now what, Mr. Expert Pilot? No, I'm sorry, you must have a license. But I told you, I can-- I know what you told me, you're an aircraft mechanic in the Marines. That's fixing them, son, you're not flying them. Get in the plane. What happened? Oh, he got a little tied up with my story and agreed to rent it. Come on. ( engine revving ) I didn't really have time to do a very thorough preflight. Three hours cruising at max speed, we got about eight minutes. Let's have a look at that flight plan again. According to this, we're at the spot where we should be landing. Well? The tanks haven't been topped. We only have about 4 minutes of fuel left. What? Hey, I've been looking around, there's no place to land. What else? We kind of only have one parachute. Kind of only? Kind of only? Michelle, do you know what you're doing? Give me that. Sir, Mr. Slade, you... you are one hell of a pilot. How tough can it be? You never forget how to fly. Just like riding a bike, except for two little things. Taking off and landing. We're here, aren't we? Do you have any idea where here is? Yeah. We're just about where we would have been. Few more minutes that way. I think. Marvelous. Uh... Michelle? Yes, Mr. Slade. Don't, don't turn around. Oh, will you come on? Oh! Are you all right? Anything broken, you think? No. Well, then... I guess for now we're out of danger. Mr. Slade. ( laughs ) I don't believe it. Your plane crash was not very discreet. ( laughs ) Razor is a fierce Mongol warrior who guards the Venus Valley from intruders. FIELDING: Two days walking, climbing, through the volcano path to the Venus Valley. How was it Hightower was able to find this place... without your assistance? Hightower, he gave Razor... much money... to take him to Venus Valley. Now you pay, I'll take you before Razor come for all of us. ( chuckles ) Check out the weird one. Shut up! ( groans ) ( horses galloping ) ( neighs ) ( groaning ) ( neighs ) They're gone! The backpack! They've got it. Fork! You people go right. Let's go! ( groans ) ( groans ) ( groans ) Go on. Go, go, go, go. ( screams ) ( screams ) ( screams ) ( screams ) Come on. ( horse neighing ) What the hell is this place? Somebody else lives here. ( whistles ) ( yelling ) ( speaking in foreign language ) You are not from the tribe. No. ( cheering ) Sorry about that. Women's lib hasn't made it here yet. What the hell is going on? Well, they know where the Venus Valley is. But right now these guys are a little bit concerned with Razor and his Mongols. Mongols, that's right. That's what they are, but how? Here, today? I don't know but, uh... they've been terrorizing these little guys for years. Huh? Yeah. The leader says that they know how to make thunder and lightning. So however they got here, they brought gunpowder and crude firearms with them. What about the valley? Well, the deal is, before they're gonna help us, we got to help them. ( indistinct chatter ) ( laughing ) ( horse neighs ) ( neighs ) ( neighs ) ( yelling ) ( groaning ) ( groans ) ( grunts ) ( groaning ) ( groans ) Sulfur. Saltpeter and nitrates. This is the place. ( groans ) ( groaning ) ( groaning ) ( groaning ) ( screams ) ( speaking in foreign language ) This is the path of the volcano. What you seek is below. There is danger there, for you and for you. We've come too far. Good-bye, my friends. May the good spirits protect you, my friend. ( groans ) I should have made sure of you. ( chuckles ) A mistake I will not make, Mr. Slade. Give me the spearhead. Noble, Mr. Slade. But you know you only have two choices, whether to die before or after I get the spearhead. ( groans ) ( groaning ) ( groans ) ( groans ) ( groans ) You have come seeking what others have sought. It lies in a cave at the high end of our valley, and you shall have it. Just like that? Silence! Is that your man? Yes. Good. That will make a better contest. You will meet my champion in the game above the pit of death. If you lose, you will die and your man will be mine. If you win, you shall have what you seek and your freedom. No outlander has ever won. Let the game begin. ( grunting ) ( groans ) ( growling ) What-- ( grunting ) ( grunting ) ( grunting ) ( growling ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( groans ) ( growls ) ( screams ) ( growling ) ( screams ) ( screaming ) ( growling ) ( screams ) ( screams ) ( growls ) ( screaming ) ( screams ) Mercy! Mercy! Kill me! Kill me! Please! Keep your word or join her. - ( hisses ) - ( screams ) ( grunts ) Do you really think this will save the future? ( gunshot ) Haven't got your Nazi ass-lickers now, how do you feel? ( chuckles ) We are everywhere! We will carry the word to future generations, where the new order will be genetically engineered. Accidents such as yourself and your lady friend will not happen. - ( screams ) - ( gunshot ) I'll show you! You stupid son of a bitch! Run, Michelle, run! ( laughs ) Emotions! Always the undoing of the foolish and the unworthy. You don't have the right. Oh, but I do. I know what mankind is, full of pustules that must be purged before they infect all that surrounds them. And you believe me, don't you? Give me the spear and you will rise next to me! Kill him, Slade! You hear that whore, Slade? Always they plead, they dust the earth. I offer you power. I offer you power, and these pigs will beat a path to you. It's a stupid man's gamble. Give me the spear! ( groaning ) ( grunting ) ( choking ) ( groans ) ( grunts ) Slade! Send you to hell, you murderous bastard! Enjoy the trip! ( rumbling ) ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ( speaking in foreign language ) ( cheering )
