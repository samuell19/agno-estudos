In the beginning, there was a question, a question that took me eight years to answer. Thank you very much. It came one night when I'd returned to my small hometown in New Jersey for a book signing. In the crowd was a face from my past. Think of the most pious person you know. For me, that was my childhood rabbi, Albert Lewis. ♪ Hello Mitchell ♪ ♪ Well, hello Mitchell ♪ ♪ It's so nice to have you back where you belong ♪ Wow. Can't believe you're here. Might I have a word with you? Wonderful talk. You had them in the palm of your hand. Thanks. And another number one book. I tell you, the entire synagogue is very proud of you. Look, I'm sorry I don't get back there too often. It's a long trip from Detroit. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. This is not an inquisition. I came to ask you a favor. Me? You. Okay. Will you do my eulogy? Your what? My eulogy. It's what they say when... No, I know what a, are you dying? Not yet. Then why do you want me... I'm 82. I like to be prepared and I think you're a good choice, so what do you say? Uh. Think about. "Will you do my eulogy?" That was his question. My question was more blunt. Why me? I was a writer, a sports writer. I've never done anything like what he was asking. But as he walked down that hallway, although I didn't know it yet, I was already following him. This is a story about believing in something and the two very different men who taught me how. One was Albert Lewis who followed a traditional path. He studied, was ordained, took a position at our temple and never left. The other was Henry Covington. On your knees! Don't run! Hands behind your head now! He came to faith in a more roundabout way, starting with the things he saw as a child in the early '60s in Brooklyn. All right, Henry, you wanna try? Mm-hm. Recite your numbers. Two times two is four. Uh-huh. Two times four is eight. Uh-huh. And two times eight, 16? That's right. Numbers matter, boy. It's how you count your money. ♪ I brought you flowers and I gave you due ♪ ♪ But money's the only thing that seems to cure your blues ♪ What you think you're doing? Ha. It's Friday night, I'm gonna do what I wanna do. Yeah, I know where you going. Mm-hm. And I'm still going. No, I'm sick of this, Willie! Do you hear me? Uh-huh! People across the dang street heard you! Am I right, Henry? Cleaning houses, seven kids, and then you go run around on me! Woman, shut your mouth! Come on now! Come on. No more! Put the gun down! Mama! Wilma, Wilma, come on, come on now! Wilma, put it down now! You gotta run fast! Come on, put that gun down now, Wilma! You gotta run fast! Put down your gun, don't be stupid now! Come on, come on, come on now! Wait now, wait, wait now! Someone once said that children are proof that God is not discouraged. But what keeps a child from losing faith? Hi baby. Hi mama. Are you being a good little man? Mm-hm. And you've been doing to church every week? Mm-hm. The Lord is watching over you, Henry. I feel it. I feel you gonna be the one to bring his word. When are you coming home, mama? Look, you know your mama's not a bad person, don't you? Does your father tell you I'm a bad person? He says you're a bad shot. You say your prayers every night, okay? And you thank Jesus for what he's given you, you hear? Yes, ma'am. Opening day of the 2000 season from the Tigers brand new ballpark in downtown Detroit. A eulogy? Isn't that his job? I know, right? What'd you tell him? I told him I'd think about it. But you're not even religious. Well, I used to be, when I was a kid, I'd go to synagogue every Saturday. Today's Saturday. And I am covering a baseball game. Sports is a religion, all right? The good Lord wanted me to hit that curveball over the wall. Yeah, yeah, yeah, good Lord wanted the pitcher to get rocked. Religion is so over the top these days. Either they wanna steer everyone's life or they want everyone to let go of the wheel. Leave it up to the good Lord. How are you gonna do a eulogy for a clergyman? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't go. When's your flight? In an hour. Plenty of time. Let's debate it. First of all, why me? I'm not even observant. That makes you unworthy? Yeah. Well, he doesn't think so. We got to his services once a year. That's more than some people. I'm married to a Christian. And he's always been great to me. I'm way too busy. You have time for your books, plays, newspaper, TV. I'll miss the game. There are other games. What if I just don't want the responsibility? It's not a job, Mitch. It's a favor. Yeah, I know. He's asking me a favor. Adam hid in the Garden of Eden. Jonah hopped a boat and got swallowed by a whale. There's a fine tradition of man running away from God, but here I was back in New Jersey, headed in the opposite direction. Entree, entree. Is something wrong? No, I just, I've never seen you out of a suit or a robe before. Well, robes can be difficult if you clean your garage. Coming? Nice socks. Well, I keep meaning to clean up in here. Come in, come in. Oy. Have you read all of these books? Yes. That's impressive. Maybe not. I mean, there's books, and there's action. You have a file on God? Yes. But don't tell him. To start, I thought I'd try to get to know you better for the, you know, for the... Yeah. Thing. Eulogy. That's right, the eulogy. The eulogy. Um. So I'll ask you some questions. Ask away! Make my day. Let's start with God. Do you believe in God? Yes. Occupational hazard. You ever speak to him? I speak to God all the time. Really? What do you say? These days? I say, ♪ Dear Lord, if you're gonna take, take me already ♪ ♪ And if you're gonna leave me, leave me ♪ But leave me with enough strength to take care of my congregation. Do you get an answer? Still waiting. ♪ Whoa, Jesus gave me water ♪ ♪ Jesus gave me water ♪ ♪ Jesus gave me water ♪ All right, there you go. I'll put a little bit more on it, okay? Now, God loves you, dear. Hi there, young man. There you go. Thank you, Pastor. God bless ya. Henry. Is that you? Where you been? I can't eat nothing. Pick up those dishes. Pick up that mess I made. Take those dishes to the kitchen. I hustled my whole life and now I gotta lie here like a cripple. Don't wait for nobody to give you nothing in this life, Henry. You want something, you take it. You hear me? You take it. Henry never forgot his father's words. As he grew into a man on the streets of Brooklyn, he adopted the hustler's credo: Take or be taken. What you bothering them for, Henry? She ain't for you. It ain't like she for you. That girl's cold. I don't want her. Uh-huh. Hold up. Henry! Morris! What's the bad word? Morris, you know anything about a gray Camaro disappeared off Pitkin Avenue last night? Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh? We'll see. Man, why didn't you tell me about no car? How much you get for that? We could take him out, Henry. I ain't with that, man, nah. You ain't got my back, man? How much you get for that Camaro? Ah! Oh! What? Keep going, keep going. Come on, come on. You can't crack that. Watch me. Wasting your time, man. All right, come on, six. Girl, you know how to toss them balls. I got a necklace for you. You got a necklace for me? You don't even know my name. Your name's Annette. I've been seeing you. You've been watching me, everyday across the street, you and slumpy. He ain't no good. Uh-huh. You talk to him? It was a short conversation. What about you? Why you wanna talk to me? When you want something in life, you gotta take it. Well, one day I'm gonna buy us a house. How you gonna get it? Shoot some dice, I don't know. Come on, six. Come on, six! That was three months ago. You still won't forget it. Sasha! Is that you? Hey! Police, stand back! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hands in the air! Brooklyn PD, get down! What are you doing? What is going on? Henry Covington, you're under arrest for the death of Officer JL McLendon! What? Friday night! He was with me! I didn't do nothing! That's not what some of your boys tell us! Stop this! Who? Get him up. Let him go! Get off of me! You have a right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. I didn't do nothing! Can I get you anything else to drink? More beer! Moore beer, please. Mitch will have some Manischewitz wine. Funny. So you went to his house in Jersey? Yeah, just ring the doorbell. So? I didn't know clergymen had doorbells. I thought they just sensed we're coming. So his house was all holy? He's a rabbi, not a monk. What did you talk about? I asked him if he believed in God. Oh, start with the easy stuff. Asked him if he had vision like a burning bush. And? He said it doesn't happen that way, usually something unexpected pulls you in, before you know it, you're... You're making miracles. Or asking for one. That's not enough, is it? How do you know you have enough for a eulogy? I don't know, Apostle Albom. Looks like you're gonna be missing a few more ballgames. ♪ Hello Mitchell ♪ ♪ Well, hello Mitchell ♪ ♪ It's so nice to have you back ♪ What? Your vest. You like? Army/Navy store. Come in. We'll pick up where we left off. My search for a eulogy meant more trips back to my old congregation in New Jersey. Please be seated. Which reminded me that watching Albert Lewis do his sermon was like watching a great master paint. A country preacher decides to put the fear of God into his congregation. So he comes in bellowing, "Remember, everyone in this parish is going to die one day!" Then he looks down and he sees a man in the front smiling. He says, "Why are you so happy?" The man says, "I'm not from this parish! "I'm just visiting my sister." Albert knew when funny was the right medicine and when not so funny was the right medicine. My friends, you cannot simply say, "We're not from this place." We're losing touch with one another, disconnecting from our Kehila Kedosha, our sacred community. We forget God. We forget our rituals. We forget our ties with one another. And if we lose our ties to each other, what have we got? Huh? Thanks Rabbi Lewis. Thank you. Gotta go now. Shalom. Bye-bye. You know, I'd never have gotten close to you at that age. Why not? I was terrified. Of me? Yeah. You were like this giant. We used to call you the Reb, like a superhero, The Thing, The Hulk. The Reb. Honestly, if I saw you coming, I ran. No. Oh, I hid in the mop closets, seriously. Had we known that, we would've added you to our custodial staff. Oh, I found your class. Graduation from our Sunday school. Remember? There I am. That was a whole other life. Henry Covington, imprisoned for a crime he did not commit, felt betrayed by life, and mad at the world. He grew bitter and distant. When he got out, Henry married Annette. And for a while, they tried to live a quiet working life. But as he grew older, Henry felt foolish walking the straight and narrow path. Although his mother had once told him he'd be a preacher, Henry had his eye on more material things. Oh hey, baby. I'm sorry I'm so late, but that last call I had, it just, well, took a while. I would've brought you a shirt. Yeah, I, let me get you a drink. Okay. What's happening, Donnie. Yeah, hey, hey, what up, bug man! I'm just playing with you, man. What's up? Nothing, man, nice party. Yeah? Yeah. Nice suit, man. Yeah. Where you get that? Do you like that, you know that's the real deal, right? Yeah. Huh, you know that's the high twist wool, Italian tailored. Yeah, you want a suit like that, man, hm? Yeah, I want a suit like that.

Oh, man. What? Bad news? Detroit's down two in the ninth. I'm sorry. You were saying? Yeah, Bar Mitzvah, 1930. My father gave me a suit. I was so proud. Later, my cousin Daniel was, well, his family had some money, unlike us. He sees me and he breaks out laughing. "That's my old suit! "Hey, guys, Al is wearing my old suit!" Was it? Yeah. My father got it from my uncle. I was so ashamed. Later that night, I said to my father, I said, it's not fair. Their family's not religious and they have money. We're religious and we don't.

That's Jesus. Right. Sorry. No, don't be sorry. It's still good. Have you ever noticed how babies, their little fists are clenched like that? Yeah.

I'm yours in the morning, anything you want me to do. Six years had now passed since Albert Lewis asked me for a eulogy. I was beginning to think that he would do mine. At work, I found myself pondering things he'd said, like, "What's your glory?" Here I was, a writer in a city whose biggest story was its own decline. So, one week, instead of a football game, I tried a more substantial assignment. Hey. Ain't you that Mitch Albom writer, man? Yeah. Well, I'll be. Yeah. So what happened to you? What happened to me? A fair question given the location. No one expects to end up in a place like this. After dinner, these men had prayed and thanked the Lord, and I kept thinking, thank you? For what? But lying there that night, I began to understand how grateful we can be, for even the smallest human kindness when we need it, like a place to sleep when you don't have one. Everyone belongs somewhere. Hadn't the Reb said that? A man seeks employment on a farm and he hands his letter of recommendation to his new employer. The letter reads simply, "He sleeps in a storm." Desperate for help, the owner hires the man. Several weeks pass, and one night, a powerful storm rips through the valley. The howling wind awakens the owner who calls for his new hired hand, but the man is sleeping soundly. So the owner leaps outta bed and races to the barn, and sees to his amazement that the animals are secure, the bales of wheat are bound and wrapped, the silo doors are latched, and the grain is dry. Ah. Now he understands. He sleeps in a storm. My friends, if we tend to the things that are important in life, if we are right with those we love, and behave in line with our faith, we will never wallow in the agony of "I should have, I could have." No. We can sleep in a storm. Does he treat you with such chivalry? Not a chance. Where is your walker? Ah. I don't like the congregation to see that. I mean, who wants a rabbi with apparatus? Your message was beautiful today. Thank you. I'm stopping. Stopping what? Sermons, all of it. No, you can't retire. I'm already retired. No. Rabbi Emeritus. Ooh, fancy word for ancient. Come on, you've been here for 58 years. You're just getting the hang of it. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Okay. I'm stopping soon. Ah. And now this. A vital story you did about the homeless. Thank you. Ah. Spent the night at a shelter, huh? Never seen him so grateful to come home. And the reaction in Detroit? Almost as much as if I'd written about football. No, it was good. Even raised some money. Started a little charity. Janine kinda pushed me into that. Ah. Another reason I like you. Thank you. "He who saves a single life, "it's as if he saves the entire world." Who said that? It's the Talmud, Mitch. Your faith. She's a nice church, ain't she? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You're the peanut guy. Yeah, and you the guy with the tape recorder. That's right. Yeah, I remember you. Wow. Yeah, yeah. So they have a homeless shelter here? Yep. You look like you doing all right. No, it's not for me. I was wondering if you or if this place needed some assistance. Ah, Brother Cass. Brother Cass. I'm the elder of the church here. Oh, I'm sorry, Brother Cass. Mitch Albom. Okay, well, you need to come talk to the pastor. Come on in. You worried about your car? No. You should be. And one day, we're gonna fix that! Are you the maintenance man? Maintenance man, mm-hm! Also the security guard. Some days, I'm the accountant. Some days, even the cook. But everyday, and twice on Sunday, I'm the pastor. Henry Covington. And you are? Embarrassed. So I understand you wanna help us out. Yeah, started this little charity. For why? Why what? Why you wanna help? I don't know, why do most people wanna help, to do some good, right? Well, we got some drug dealers. You see those two fellas up there? They wanna help too. All I gotta do is let them operate outta the basement and they'll pay to fix everything around here. Well, I'm not a drug dealer. Well, I was. Look, I'm an ex-con, okay? I did some time for manslaughter. Were you guilty? Not of that, but plenty other stuff. Like what? Armed robbery, assault, sold all kinds of drugs. Wow. Crack addict. Heroinhead. Alcoholic. You reconsidering your offer? No. Wondering at what point are you disqualified from the pulpit. I had a night, thought it was the end, thought I was gonna be murdered in the street, so I made a deal with God. If he got me through the night, he could have me in the morning. Sun came up, I was still alive. So I went inside and fell to my knees, thanked the Lord. A week later, the guy who was after me got locked up. So you kept your promise. Yep. Long road. Got clean and joined a church, became a deacon, then an elder. Eventually, got sent here to Detroit to start a place and this is it. I Am My Brother's Keeper, a church with a hole in the roof. A church. Oh. The boiler repairman's here. Okay. I appreciate your offer, but maybe you should check us out first, come to Sunday service. I'm Jewish. We start at 11. My background doesn't bother you? Not if mine doesn't bother you. I've never really been to a Sunday church service before. It's probably not that much different from a synagogue. You ever been in a synagogue? Oh yeah, once. For what? We were robbing it. Wait. You're going to church? Kinda got roped into it. You weren't even active in your own religion. Now you're double-dipping? Pastor is different. He's been a crook, drug dealer, junkie. Yeah, does he do sermons on safecracking? Well, he didn't have to tell me that. He's not bothered by the fact I'm not his faith. Mitch. Hey. Of course not, you're giving him money. Well, not yet. I mean, he hasn't asked for it. He said I should get to know him better. You know, it's kinda like... What? You're right. I'm getting involved with two clergymen. Don't worry. You'll always got us horsemen of the apocalypse to balance you out. Hello. What? When? All the way from Detroit, you came. He's sleeping. What happened? A small stroke, they say. What's small about a stroke, I say. Do you want me to stay with him? If you don't mind. No. No. The kids will be back soon. I could stretch my legs. Go, go, go.

There's no money to fix it? I wish. What about dues? Dues? Well, our folks don't pay enough dues. Here it is. Wow. This must've been so beautiful once. Yeah, it was the biggest Presbyterian church in the entire mid-west 120 years ago. Got so neglected they practically gave it to him. Get on in here! We got food! Come on, get inside. Is that him?

Well, Al and I have had 30 wonderful years together. You've been married longer than that. True. On Monday, you get a good two hours. On Tuesday, you get a good 45 minutes. You add it all up, a wonderful 30 years. Some philosopher, huh? Who's gonna take all of this when I'm gone? I'll take a copy of What's Your Glory! off of you. I'm flattered. So I've been meeting with this pastor. What? You need advice, you come to the synagogue. No, no, no, no, not that way. What way? I know you prefer asking questions. It's all right. This guy in Detroit, he runs a homeless shelter out of his church. There's this giant hole in his roof. Well, can you help? I don't know. This guy has done some very bad things. Done or doing? Do you think people can change? If I didn't think that, I shouldn't be in this business. I've seen people change. It can be inspiring. Hey Cass. Hey, hey, hey, Brother Mitch. I'm looking for Pastor Henry. Yeah, he's right over there. He'll see you. He'll be on his way over in a minute. Why don't you come on in here and get warm? Cold out there. Come on in here. Get out of the cold, man. Yeah, I'm coming. Now, remember now, still got to hear my story. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Winter surely is coming. Cass told me to wait up here. That's fine, that's fine. I just had to take care of a little business. What kind of business? Pastor business. This poor roof won't keep nothing dry. Heat comes in, goes right up out the hole in the roof. We're so far behind on our gas bills, I can't even tell you. How much would it cost to fix it? Well, somebody said 80,000. They might as well be saying eight million, huh? Maybe this church is too big for you. I believe that God put me here for a reason. And I know we are going to find a way. The right way. The right way. You coming to service on Sunday? Again? First time was just a warmup. I'll try if I get back in time from New Jersey. What's in New Jersey? I'm visiting my old rabbi. A rabbi? You got a thing for the clergy? It's a eulogy. It's complicated. Oh. Well, Sunday then. That Sunday, there was no heat in the church, so the congregants constructed plastic walls to fight the cold and rain. Nothing, it seemed, could dampen their spirits. ♪ Oh, lay down my burdens ♪ ♪ Down by the riverside ♪ ♪ Study war no more ♪ Praise the Lord! Praise God! Amen. Our reading for today, comes from the book of Acts, and tells us about Paul... After he was changed. After he was changed, the people mistrusted Paul because he used to persecute the church and now he praised it! So people say, "Well, how can this be the same guy?" You know, it's amazing how some people can't see you now 'cause they wanna keep you, what, in your past. It reminds me of when I talk to some people from my old days back in New York. They say, "Well, you know Henry got "a whole new game working up there in Detroit. "He a pastor now. "He running a whole new game." See, just like Paul, they can only see him for what he was and not what he became! When you see people only through their past, you're missing what God can do with him. You are not your past. Hallelujah. Hallelujah! Hey now! Bless the Lord, bless the Lord! A little Down by the Riverside, if you please. ♪ Hold my burdens ♪ ♪ Down by the riverside ♪ Oh! Whoa. What happened now? Hi honey. I'm making pasta for the nephews. We can take it with us when we go over there tonight. What's wrong? I don't know what I'm doing in that church. It's freezing. We're all in a plastic tent and then the power got cut off. During the service? They're, like, months behind on their payments. So now there's no heat and no electricity. Well, can't the charity collection help? No, no, no. It's too much, they need a whole new roof. Besides, I'm not sure... What? I saw Pastor Henry talking with these drug guys. For all I know, he could be using their money. Oh, come on. Well, he's got the history. He's a pastor now. What, you've never heard of a crooked pastor? You never heard of straightening out? Janine just listen to me. I wanna do something to help people, but between a rabbi and a pastor and the church and the synagogue, I just, I'm not sure about any of this. I know. So just do what feels right. Gotta have a little faith in yourself. The time had come for the Reb's final sermon. He could've bragged about six decades in one congregation, instead, he apologized. For not being able to save more marriages, to the teenagers I did not take enough time to get to know, for failing to ease the pain of grieving parents, for failing to study more because illness and distraction stole my focus. For all these things, to you, my congregation, and to you, dear God, grant me atonement. "Grant me atonement." Those were his last three words on the pulpit, then he took a seat in the back row of the sanctuary. His sermons were now complete. Great to hear from you, and how is your sister? Yes, I'm very pleased that the surgery was successful. Yes. Oh, good, good. Of course, we'll hold your seat in Sheol. Don't worry. Yes. Yes, and a very happy Thanksgiving to you and your family. Thank you. Bye-bye. Why are you still calling congregants? You're retired. Yeah, the old members like to hear my voice. Keeps them connected. Kind of my only connection too. No, no. All the tradition in this room connects you and it will after I'm gone. Okay. Here's a thought. What if when you die, you find out you get five minutes alone with God? Oh. You can ask anything you want. Anything. What do you ask? Oh. All right. First, I would give three minutes to my family. I'd say, Lord, if any of them are hurting, speak to them. Don't speak to me. Okay. And then I'd take another minute to help anybody in the world who's in need. You still have one minute left. And in that one minute, I would say, dear Lord, I've tried to lead a good life and follow your teachings and be of help to others, so, Dieu, after all this, what's my reward? And what do you think he'd say? He'd say, "What are you talking about, reward? "Albert, that's what you're supposed to do." So we toast everyone who's here, and we remember everyone who's not. And Mitch is probably gonna tease me 'cause he's been overdosing on all this stuff for a while, but can I just say, Lord, we all know how blessed we are and we thank you. Amen. Amen. ♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪ ♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪ ♪ For the Bible tells me so ♪ Let us give praise this Thanksgiving.

I'll see you in the morning. Mm-hm. Try and get warm. All right. Dear Lord, please send us some help if you can. If you can. Hey. Hey. I didn't know you were here. You watch over them all night? If I don't, who will? So cold. Yeah. I was just asking God for help. You know, sometimes, they mess up when they read the meters. You're praying for a meter mistake? Sometimes a mistake is the best thing that can happen. Henry, I saw you with those drug dealers. Are you working with them? I have to. Marcus and Deron, promised them a better life if they quit dealing. Well, I can't say I'm really doing too much for them at the moment though. Wait a second, that's them? Yeah, they're junkies too. If you're dealing, you're using. I know what I'm talking about. You were counseling them? Yeah, what else? You made a lot of money in that business. Even half a million one year. Well, you gotta want that money now. No, I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. What do you mean? When I was young, Mitch, I broke every one of the 10 commandments, you hear? I should be in hell for the things I've done, Mitch. God would be justified. You do so much good now. Well, you can't work your way into heaven. God showed me that much grace. I be blessed, but either way, I sure wish he would send us some electricity. I gotta go. All right then. All right. I used to think I knew so much. I could look down and scoff at things, even faith. But I realized that night that I am not better or smarter than anyone, only luckier. The men sleeping on Henry's church floor never looked down. They only looked up to find comfort and love. And I realized that in looking at Henry Covington, I was seeing the rarest of things, a changed man. Hey Mitch. How you doing? That church series, good stuff. We should be doing more of that. Thanks. They cut their power and their heat, unbelievable, at Christmas. Yeah. Lewis, Albert Lewis? He's getting tests. What are they saying? Oh. "Heart issues. "The strokes. "He's 90." That's mostly what they say. Hey. Ah, family. I'm home from the war. Ain't this a pickle? You gotta start acting your age. You're not 89 anymore. Thanks Gerald. I'll be fine. Okay, Rabbi. Gerald? Nice fella. What did they say? Eh. They said everything, they said nothing. I'll be okay. Well, so long as you're here, might I have a word with you? Let's find the doctor, come. Help me? Here, go in. Thank you. ♪ The old gray rabbi ain't... ♪ Is still what he used to be, still what he used to be. Good, good. Still what he used to be. That's good. Okay? You won't be able to make fun of my clothing this time. See, I'm wearing a robe. Thank you. You know, my friend, it might be time for you to write something down. I'm not ready. What, do you need more material? I'm not talking about the eulogy. Why else have you been coming all this time? I came because you needed something. I kept coming because I needed something. And did I give you what you needed? Thank you for making an old rabbi feel useful. Dear Lord, please give Mitchell many, many more years so that when we see each other again, we'll have lots to talk about. Do you really believe that? Don't you? I don't think I'm going the same place you're going. Why not? You're a man of God. Ah. You're a man of God too. Everyone is. Are you still helping those poor souls in Detroit? I'm trying. Keep trying. That's your glory. Eight years after he asked me for his first and only favor, I delivered a eulogy for Albert Lewis. I stood where he used to stand. I looked out the way he once looked out. Eight years ago, you came to me. I saw our congregation and I realized he was right. And you said you had a favor to ask. I was home. Eight years later, I sometimes wonder if the whole thing wasn't some clever rabbi trick to lure into some adult education course. You told me that I would find something to say when this day came. But it is here and you are gone, and this pulpit seems as empty as a desert. Where do we look for you now? This is your house, Reb. You're in the rafters, the floorboards, the walls, the lights. You're in every echo through every hallway. You are woven through us, from our birth to our death. You educated us. You married us. You comforted us. And when we howled at God, you stirred the embers of our faith and reminded us that the only whole heart is a broken heart. Look at all the broken hearts here today, Reb. How do we say goodbye to you without saying goodbye to a piece of ourselves? Where do we look for you now? By the way, about the singing, Walt Whitman sang the Body Electric. Billie Holiday sang the blues. You sang everything. You could sing the phone book. I would call and say, how are you feeling? And you'd answer, ♪ The old gray rabbi ain't what he used to be ♪ I teased you about it, but I loved it. We believe that you are with your forefathers and your daughter. May God keep you. May he sing to you, and you to him. Where do we look for you now, Reb? We look where you had been trying, good sweet man of God, to get us to look all along. We look up. Hey. Mitch. I brought something for the pastor. Come on in. Henry! Yeah? Mitch is here! Go ahead and have a seat. All right. Henry! I'll be right down! Mr. Mitch! I don't know if you saw the story, came out last week. Oh yes, I did. Yes, indeed. Okay. Lord works in mysterious ways. Now I want those. Yeah. Meet me at the church? Got something I wanna show you. Hey Brother Mitch! Hey! What's going on? How you doing, Cass? Where've you been? I was just over at Pastor's house. I know that place real well. Come on, man, get in here. Might be cold. I'm coming. Ooh, guess we don't have to worry about a white Christmas. No, we sure don't with all this snow. So how did you meet Henry? Well, he kinda met me. He actually offered me a job unloading trucks. Oh really? Yeah. Unloading ham trucks to be honest. One ham for the church, two for me. Me and a buddy of mine, we'd throw one, two into the bushes. You'd steal them? Yeah, we'd steal them. I was still on drugs. I was still using. What'd you do? Man, I did everything. I did heroin, crack, pills, alcohol. You name it, I did it. Did Henry know you were stealing? You know, he really did because one day he came to me and he said, "Cass, do you got enough to eat?" The way he said it, I kinda knew. I kinda felt real low. Is that what made you stop? Well, I didn't stop. Actually, I would get the hams and I would sell them for more drugs. Yeah? I was homeless. Kicked in the door, I was living in an abandoned house over in the projects. But one day, somebody, in my little home, they came in and they stole all the copper piping. I kinda woke up in a pool of water. I guess it was sorta like a baptism. But now, I'm all soaked. I ain't gonna be able to go work for Pastor, but I went over there to tell him. He looked at me and he said, "Well, I'm gonna get you some clean clothes." Threw me the keys to the church, told me how to get in and how to cut off the alarm. And right there, amazed me. So when in came back, he said, "Well, Cass, where you going to live?" And I said, I ain't got no place to live. And he said... And the man looked at me and he said, "Why don't you come live with me?" Here's this man I'm stealing from, he didn't really know me, he didn't know me, he moved his family upstairs and he let me live on his couch for a whole year. We became real good friends. If he wouldn't have came, he wouldn't have gave a guy a chance, I'd be dead now. I know I'd be dead now. This is the story you've been trying to tell me. Thought you should know, and the man needs your help. Whoa! Presents! Hallelujah. People coming from everywhere! Churches, schools. Wow. We had a synagogue send all kinds of stuff. So many people read your story, the heat and power got turned on the next day. We got snow. Yes, we do. It's a miracle. It is. It is. You know, Mitch, I owe you an apology. When you first came around, I didn't understand why a Jewish person would wanna help us. And I apologize. I should apologize to you. I judged you. Forgive me. That I do. That I do. Your rabbi passed, huh? He did. You would've loved him. I have his obituary. There he is. Your hands up! Is this the man that robbed you? Is this the man that robbed you? This is the man? The Reb. Reminds me of a man who did me a favor once. Praise God. All right now, come on in. Everybody gets a present. Whoa. Yeah. Merry Christmas, I guess. Merry Christmas. In time, I wrote a book about the Reb and Henry. And amazingly, people began to send envelopes to the church with five or $10 inside, until one morning, just before the next Christmas, the congregation gathered for a different kind of service. ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Pass the shingles ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ All down the hill ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Pass the shingles ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ I realized later, it's not about having the answers in life.
