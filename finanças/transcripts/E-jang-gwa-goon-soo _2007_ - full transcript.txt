No, it's the second one. The one living in Suwon. So, who will be the village's next chief? Who will be what? Village chief, man! Oh, that. We've got elections approaching too. If you're so worried, why don't you give it a try? I'm busy. You said you wanted the job. Never! The old man was sitting on the job for a long time, It sure is time for a change, we'll go by the book and settle by vote. Vote? With this bunch? That's democracy, man. Shut up, you! It's time for a young man to be village chief! Aw, father, let us deal with the problem! I don't want to see any of you guys become the next village chief! So then who's left? What are you doing? 30 minutes for a game of cards, dammit. Sleeping? Shucks, Let's play draw now. This is too complicated! What is there to be complicated? Just put down any card. What did I tip you about earlier? Play the low cards first. Just put it down. That's a wrong pair, old man. You can't take ‘em. Shucks, you'll pay for this! - What! - What the... I knew that guy would do that. Can't believe he's making the same mistake! Men are such evil things. Why is he always the vulgar character? Oh, look at him. He's pitiful. Now, watch. Watch carefully. Watch, so that you won't start grumbling again. All right! One card each, come on! Would he say yes? I doubt it. He wouldn't even listen to us. You tickle him and he'll start waggling his tail. Village chief? Nope. Hey, what's wrong with village chief? I saw someone who started off as a village chief become a minister! So we'll have a minister from our village? No way, I'm not doing it. - You guys really suck at acting. - What an atmosphere... You're the worst, Chun. hat is this? Come on, we're not that bad! From today, Choonsam's our chief! JO Choonsam! JO Choonsam! Aw, guys! I don't want to be village chief. SMALL TOWN RIVALS Hello. Excuse me! Hi! I was looking for you. Yeah. So tiring. You're younger than what I've heard. - And who're you? - Oh, I'm from the town office. I'm here because I can never reach you on phone. So what brings you here? A lot of things, obviously! Aren't you the newly appointed town chief? Appointed? Shucks, I'm no president, you know. - You're JO Choongsam? - Yeah, that's me. You are the new town chief, then! Huh? Oh, look at these healthy peppers! A bowl of rice with these would be perfect. Sir, could I pick a few of these? Just a couple. - Uh, yeah... - Thank you! These are big! All righty. So... - Are you married? - No, not yet. What, a fine looking man like you still not married? The looks are fine but... Hey, hey, you're not picking the right ones. This one tastes bad. These here are the crunchy ones. Come look, these down here. The people's confidence will be rewarded! Vote for candidate number two! Remember candidate number four! The region's truebred, candidate number one. Candidate number two! I wanna love somebody Dunno about anything else, but we need a good county magistrate. So who's the likely winner? Hey chief, who should we vote for? They're all the same, take your pick. Candidate no. 4, NOH Daegyu. What is it? Give me a chance, huh? What? Class president! Dumbass. Are you crazy? I'm moving to a bigger town soon. So? Class president can bolster my career prospects. That'll help me. Let me think... You can run for president after I'm gone. I guess you've had enough with being vice-president. So you'll drop candidacy? Yeah, the job's all yours. You promise? I'm fed up with being president anyway. Aw, look at this guy. Vice chief should fit you better. That ain't straight, is it? Naw, it's perfectly straight. Look at that guy talk! This guy looks just like a dandy. What's this madman up to again? Candidate no. 4, NOH Daegyu. Thirty seven years old? You're 37 too, aren't you Choonsam? Is he a schoolmate of yours? Yes he is. Is that right? He used to live in our town, don't you remember Deukki's neighbor? Oh, the folks from Nonsan! - Yeah, that tiny little woman. - Aha! - He's the son, remember? - You're right. But isn't 37 too young to be a magistrate? Hey he just might become the next magistrate, you know? So we'll have someone from our town become a magistrate? That's the last thing he'll become, I tell you. - Why? - He just ain't up to it. Even if all of us vote on him? Nope. Even if our whole town vote on him? No way. Why? What do you mean, why? Just take a look at this face. This is a monster's face! What's wrong with the way he looks? Looks are what counts, pops. There's a saying that looks determine a person's life. If this guy becomes magistrate, I'll buy all of you guys drinks at the pub downtown. With girls! Oh man, that's a deal! What has the world come to. Open your eyes, dammit! Hello. This must be crude salt. When you're sweating and all, you should consume this by the handful. This looks just like ice flakes. Let's see... That's too salty, young man! That's what I call crunchy. Delicious! The town is in need of a young laborer. Candidate number 4! Where to? Where? Over here? It's time for action. Right now. Vote for number two! - Two! - Vote for number two! - Hello! - Vote for number two! This mackerel looks very fresh. Thank you for your confidence! Thank you for your support. Vote for number 4! All this will come to nothing, young man. I wouldn't say so. Nope. You should take a break, you know. Take a break? Ha! Who will take care of these people if I take a break? Well, you did have a hard time caring for he people's welfare. But I haven't heard good things about you from the folks here. Look at their expressions. I really think that I should bring back the smiles in their faces. Good job you did during you term, though. You sure know how to make jokes. Let's go. Yeah, take care, sir. Vote for candidate number two! Hello there! Choice of 2006 Hello, this is the 9 o'clock news. We now begin the ballot counting of the 2006 regional elections. Looks like a big hand to me. What Kind of rule is this? Stupid old rules... This would have been a big hand originally. Here's something you can take. What good will that do? Useless. Well then, deal your cards. Are you teasing me, pops? This ain't fun at all. Next time, we're going by my rules. I've lost a fortune all ready. What are you saying? This is how it's played, son! - You said that right. - Look here. Aha! Just what I needed! What a nice... 60 bucks each! Why 60? That pair's worth 40! - I'm not playing anymore. - Choonsam, come over here, quick! What is it? NOH Daegyu's about to get elected! Come on! Hurry! - This game's out of play, folks! - Where do you think you're going? Bastard! Now we have the news that ballot counting is done... - What did I tell you? - Shut up! Let me see the news. For the first time in the history of regional elections, one vote has been the difference for a magistrate to be elected. - All right! - He's magistrate for real now! I can't believe it, one vote? He's a classmate of our village chief! That's great news for our town! - Just one vote depends on... - So you're buying drinks, right? making difference between elected person and dropout. He looks fine to be a magistrate, don't you think? Where are my shoes? - Hmm? - My shoes. - 1 don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know? It's your first day, wear the new pair. Come on! What's wrong with the old ones? I'm running late, gimme my old pair. I really don't know where they are. I can't believe you're doing this to me. Maybe your mother did something with it. Huh? This car's here to take my magistrate son to the office. They say the mayor of Seoul has the same car. You konw? The same! You, over there! Take your dirty hands off the car! Huh? - Damn birds! - Yeojin, daddy's going to the office. - How dare them pooping on his car! - Bye bye, honey. You shouldn't all be out here greeting me. Flowers? Thank you very much! Congratulations, sir. Thank you people for your support. - Let's go inside. - OK. Congratulation Kangduk County magistrate, NOH Daegyu. You call this paperwork? A meeting? I'll be there in a while. I stand proudly in front of the national flag, with a pledge to the nation, to be loyal to the nation and the people. I'm honored to be able to work here, where I've been born and bred. You should know my name? Kangduk County magistrate, NOH Daegyu. Not ‘No thank you'. It's NOH Daegyu. You can count on me, people. Ah, hold on. Come in. Ah, yes. A visitor? This is Mr. KIM, a noted realtor in our town... Please come on in. Over here. He just dropped by, to meet the new magistrate. I invited him to come over. Right. I was hoping to meet you at the inaugural ceremony, but I heard you cancelled the ceremony. So I said to myself, why not come over to the office? Right. Mr. KIM, please sit over here. Frankly, I think ceremonies are a waste of money. Imagine how much it would cost. CEO Baek Man-geun I agree with you on that. I can feel that this man will leave his name in the history books. Of course. So shall we take a seat? Over here. I'm sorry but I've got a meeting right now. Hope to see you again soon. Sir? And could you make an appointment before visiting me? What's wrong with him? I guess he can't spare 5 minutes... Are you Kidding me? Is this a joke or what? Hey, I'm sorry. What's your excuse? I just don't feel like it, that's all. You think a village chief's something you do when you feel like it? Like a kiss? That's not really it. So what are you going to do with the wages that has been paid, and the loan from the bank? I'll pay back due time... - With what? Selling pepper? - That's a little too rough, lady. Those are first class pepper, my real pride, you know. - Pride whatever. - Huh? I vouched for the loan, remember? You want me to be unemployee? My career depends on you now. Uh... well... Don't say a word, just do your job. Okay? Really pisses me off! What are you doing tonight? Sleep, what else? I can't believe you can sleep with this mess on you! So what do I do? Have a drink with me. You know, about Choonsam... Isn't he a little too inexperienced for this job? I'm in doubt too. He's a fine young man, you Know... And what's happening to road pavement project? He's just loafing around doing nothing! Let's replace him. We shouldn't have mentioned it in the first place. That was your father's call. Because of your father! Choonsam was class president all along in primary school. - Right. - We should give him a chance, right? Cut the crap and let's replace him. The man didn't want the job! He didn't say so. Who said I didn't want the job? Talking behind me all the time. Can't even do my chores because of this new job. What is this? I had a meeting with someone from the town office. - You've taken too much booze. - Choonsam, come over here. Picked it up on my way here. I'm just trying to work hard, okay? What happened to the road pavement project? What do they say? - They're doing the job. - When? When they have time. Relax, okay? The rainy season's coming soon. We can't wait! They're saying that there's no budget for this project what can I do? Do you want to negotiate? You can't pull this off, we're putting someone else on this job! What is this for anyway? I'll get the job done, okay? You're doing fine, son. Have a drink. Yes. Sir, there's someone on line two. All right. Hello, this is the magistrate. Magistrate NOH Daegyu? Yeah, that's me. Hey, it's me! Huh? It's me, Choonsam. Choonsam? Sanchon elementary, Chungpoong middle school, Kangduk High. Don't you remember? I was class president, you were vice president. - Oh! - Yeah, yeah. You remember now? JO Choonsam. Now you remember? - You're getting transferred? - Yeah. All right then. You go for president. Can't always take the lesser role. So you're dropping candidacy? - Yeah. - You swear? Friends don't lie to each other. Trust me! If I become class president, I will use the full extent of my experience to make our class the best in this school! Once a president, always a president! Holy, Long time no see, huh? - Sure is. - First time after graduation makes it... What, 20 years? Perennial vice president has now become the magistrate. Is this a surprise or what? - Take a seat. - Yeah. You still have that weird hairdo, huh? Very nerdy, my friend. And what about that jumper you're wearing? You should at least wear a suit, like me. I can see you're busy, really. - Choonsam. - Yeah? What's all this useless talk about? I'm just glad to meet an old friend, pal. - Is that it? - Of course! Okay then. What do you want to order? - Let me see... - Waiter! So, road pavement? Yeah. Why are you asking for this? YMCA? I'm the village chief, you know. You're the chief? What's wrong with being chief? It's not being the chief, it's just that the job doesn't really suit you. Mostly the elders go for the job... Hey, hey! The magistrate doesn't suit you either. Look yourself on the mirror. You look like a flounder. Don't take it so hard, man. So are you going to help me or not? You can't ignore a close friend's request. Mother, one request will lead to another. You lack humanity, my boy. He does. It won't hurt to help out, right honey? Why are you two scolding me for? Enough! I shouldn't have mentioned it in the first place. It never hurts to lend a hand, son. So how's his father doing? - Hello. - Village chief JO Choonsam? - That's me. - It's me. Who? The magistrate. I know wise-ass. Why did you call? That project in your town. I'll try to squeeze it in on our schedule. Where's that process you were talking about? I'll take care of it, okay? Bye. Yeah, whatever. It's the village chief speaking. My announcement today is... that our long-cherished project has finally been realized, thanks to me. I know you're all surprised. Today at 2 in the afternoon, I personally went to meet my close friend, the magistrate. He was aware of our problem. So I said, official and private affairs should not be mixed. These rocks on the road, we clear them all the time. but this one here, this is where our old chief's bicycle went astray. He wasn't even going that fast. Yeah, we all try to fall over to this side. So this here's the problem. Hold on. I'll be right up. I'll be right up. Then we talk. I'll be right up. Then we talk. Wait! Okay, so let's not try to exaggerate here. So I've brought the magistrate here. Unprecedented, don't you people think? - As I've been saying, magistrate. - Yes, yes. We will also need bathing facilities at the town hall. All right, over there. Where's Mr. YANG? How can anyone live with a road so steep? We need to get it paved. He's a very close friend of mine, since elementary school. Namok, isn't it really hot out here? All right. Settle down everyone. So it's paved up to here, right? Yes. Till all the way down there. Let's take a picture. OK, ok, ok. Gather around. Back here, back here. - Stay still. Say cheese! - All right! One, two, three, ok! Everyone in town voted for you, sir! That's only natural, you know. Thank you for your support. So there's no more problem over that side? - No, none at all. - Right around the back, over there. - Oh, at the far end... - Right back there. The back alley's the problem now. Sir, do you want dinner with us? What's the big problem here? It's all the village chief's fault. Who's the village chief? Who's the chief here? Sir! Hello, sir. I'm village chief, NOH Daegyu. You are? You look my age. And you're only village chief? Mr. PARK. Let's build a new town hall an eight floor hotel. - Yes, sir. - And also a four lane, paved road over here. I'll report to the government directly. Special case, just for our town. - Let's go! - Thank you! - Yes, sir. - There's nothing I can't do. You're the greatest, magistrate. What? So what's our village chief up to now? At least he's not laying off. Do your best, pal. Why do you look so tired? It's from the fall I took just a while ago. This is against the rules, but I'm doing this especially for you. You understand? I know. Thanks. I'm saying that you should work harder. There's a good village chief behind every peaceful town. So good luck. Aren't you going? Where? Sir, don't you remember me? I used to live next to Deukki. Don't you remember? He can't remember, you're wasting your time. You used to like chicken. I brought you fried chicken. Have some. - Chicken on a hot day like this? - I'll drop by soon, sir. You should have brought some fruits. Hey. Take care of your pops, okay? I'm leaving now. Stretch your legs, pops. Daekyu. Huh? Daekyu. Vice president. President. Our town's lagging behind. Low return of taxes, and no much revenue from outside the town. Limited budget has the residents feeling aggrieved. So it's all about money, isn't it? Yeah. Money's always the problem. - In order to develop the region, - Building a casino or a golf course... Asia's largest night club... We should utilize schools that have been closed down... There's no Disneyland in Korea... If we can only attract a horse racecourse, even the stray dogs would be rich and content. - How about you sir? - Ah, me? I was thinking of a beauty pageant. A beauty pageant? What sort of pageant? We could just make anything up. Like what? Regional beauty pageants have the girls wear traditional dresses... We'll be a little creative, and go for "Miss Minnow". Have them wear bikinis, and catch minnows at the brooks. The girl with the most minnows caught will be the winner of the pageant. - Then... - Sir. Yes? Couldn't you be a little more earnest? A more realistic, approachable, plans that can unfold right now. Is that so hard to think of? It's about time civil workers should change. Ma'am. It's me, Choonsam. Choonsam? Yes. What brings you here, son? - Ma'am. - Welcome! - Have you been well? - Yes, of course. You've grown so tall. I couldn't have recognized you. You haven't changed a bit. - Ma'am. Here's a bow for you. - Yes. Oh, don't say such things... - Here. - Oh, thank you. - Here, take a sit. - All right. That's it. Let's all eat. Yeojin, eat up. Chew before you swallow. That's my girl! Why aren't you eating? Eat. Yes, ma'am. Yeah, eat. Here you go. That's okay, ma‘am. I can eat from here. Why move the garnish that's in front of me? You don't eat leek. Right, daddy doesn't eat leek. I'll say. You still don't eat leek? Unbalanced diet at your age? What are you saying? I love leek. Can't seem to have enough of it. Very crunchy. You can have some more. Here's your coffee. Right. It's good to see you again. I'm glad I dropped by. I miss hometown. It was fun going school together, right? Yeah. You still aren't married? Missed the chance, I guess. Does Daegyu treat you well? He's okay. I'm content with having a child and living with her mother. Watcha doing? Asshole. The alumni meeting of Sanchon elementary. Hey, look over here you guys. Today is the alumni meeting of Sanchon elementary. Let's drink and have some fun! Sangmi's become a real beauty. Hyunbae, what are you doing? Long time no see, Choonsam. Give me a drink. - Here, here. - Hey Choonsam. - Yeah - You used to be a real dancer. Dance for us. I'm not sure I can dance like I used to. I'm not sure I can dance like I used to. Hey guys. Hey, it's Daegyu. The magistrate's here? Long time no see. - Yes, it's benn a long time! - Finish! You gained weight, didn't you? We need fresh blood here, if we at least want to do something. Only a few of us are natives here. There's Daejeon, Suwon... And you're from Seoul. The town doesn't necessarily have to keep the natives. I'm getting a little too political again. That's okay, my friend. I can't drink a lot, so let's drink together this one last shot. - To our magistrate. Cheers! - Cheers! This time already? I've got to go. Hey, I've got to go. I've got errands to do. What? I said I'm going, Yoonpil. Yeah, I'm going. This girl's fast at everything. Hey Choonsam, you're not saying bye to the magistrate? That wise ass. Okay, okay. I'll get going, magistrate. I want food. I'm hungry. But I prepared lunch for you before I left. I said food. Hey, it's me. I was talking on the phone with brother, I can't stand with dad... Think about that if you were me... You're not so talkative today. What's wrong? Nothing. It's pouring like hell outside. How can you talk like that? That is so macho. Chief. Funny, isn't it? What? What I'm saying... Is that you seem like you don't care for others, but you have that certain leadership quality with a strong opinion and all. You've got the looks, you're really tall, you shouldn't be in a small town like this. Yeah, I've been keeping this to myself but... I really... Naw, forget it. What's the point? It's fine. I know what you're thinking. I'm just a village chief at nowhere. Why the defeatism? I'm just crazy about men that go about and diligently do their work. When I first met you, Your chest soaked with sweat had me go nuts. It's really hot in here... Oh, the buttons! It's fine, really. Leave it. No, ho, no. I'll find it. Leave it. You're saying we can all become rich? What is it? You folks should all know that, the current budget makes development a hard deal. That would mean the same thing with our own town. So we need to see on a whole new viewpoint. There is a solution to develop our town. This business plan would require the consent of you residents, so that I can submit it to the town office. So I'll need your cooperation. Now, there might be opposing opinions, but then, Let's do this. - Yes. there's no other way. So my plan is... Right. to submit for the construction of a nuclear waste center. 300 million dollars as preliminary financial support. With the completion of the center, 20 million dollars every month. There's no future for our county if we don't attract such facilities. I was a little harsh on the last meeting, and took time to be reflective. I've gone through a lot of research, and came up with the decision. What do you think? There are more negatives than positives. Of course. It's just obvious. Why bother on something so complicated? - Yeah, what's the point? - He doesn't know the reality. - We're civil servants. - We're civil servants. Let's take the safe path. That's not going to work. I'll pass with not receiving the trifle presents. This isn't it. Is he crazy? Don't try to think to hard. Speak freely. We're all for your plan sir. Good idea. Yeah. That sounds fantastic. Yes. And you, sir? We should have pulled this off much earlier. Yes. All right, then. We'll need a task force for this. Good job, everyone. Sir, I will have to ask you to organize a task force for this project. What? CHOI should have been re-elected. What would a rookie know? Exactly. He also got rid of the official vehicle. And moves on his own car. He also removed the pressroom. Now he's talking nonsense about bringing in a nuclear waste center. We're going crazy because of him. That's not going to change anything. Politics isn't as easy as he thinks. We've got a scoundrel from nowhere as magistrate. He's going to have a hard time soon. Ma'am, take a break. I need your fingerprint here. Right here. I'll have to know what this is about. Just do it right here. It's all about making our town a better place. Road pavement will make here a better place. If this is done, road pavement will be a piece of cake. We'll have an expressway over here. Eight lanes. We don't need any expressways here. Okay. No benefits for you, then. Okay, okay, give me the papers. Here you go. An ecology town? There's no better place to experience nature undisturbed by humans. Isn't it awesome? That sounds great. I'll file the request to the county office. But... But what? - They're a little busy right now. - Why? There's been special orders from the county office. We're all tied up on that project. I doubt that this will be realized. In that case, I'll call the magistrate myself. This is just paperwork, I was trying to follow the process. I didn't want to burden an old friend, with something like this. I'll call him myself. The major papers are in favor of our project. But the regional papers... They don't even know the details. How can they give an opinion like this? Sir, shouldn't we call a meeting with all the village chiefs, I already told you to have them meet separately? But it's best if you took stage. All right. Call the meeting, and let me talk to the reporter. Yes, sir. Hello, this is NOH Daegyu. It's me. What is it? I've come up with a great plan for our town. Hey, your town isn't the only place I've got to take care of. If it's not something important, let's talk later. Hey, hey, hey! It's not something that hard. I've submitted a proposal... - Sorry, I'm busy right now. - Hello? You see? I told you it wouldn't work. He said he'll call me back. I'll get going then. This is a very elaborate plan. Huh. You'll obviously know that... Hey, magistrate NOH. NOH Daegyu. What did I tell you? You can't hang up on me like that... - Let's talk somewhere else. - You hear me? - Let's talk later, okay? - Yes, sir. Hey, come over here. He's busy right now. Come visit him later. What the... Hold on. Hey, asshole! You sure he's a friend of yours? You know the folks that take x-rays at the hospital? You know them, right? The gloves and clothing that they wear, those are disposed of on a can and sealed tightly to be stored underground. Nothing dangerous involved. Then, well... How much compensation do we get then? It would be best to get you as much as possible, but these things aren't that simple. I can't deal with this alone. That's why I'm here today to ask - for your cooperation... - Cooperation, bull shit. What cooperation do you need, anyway? Before you ask for any of that, you'll have to make yourself clear, and tell us what level of cooperation would be needed, or whether it would harm anyone. Don't try to cheat on these innocent people. That's just natural, isn't it? You'll have to persuade these... naive people how much will be compensated, per household and per person. Isn't that right? Yeah, that's right. Looks like you've been drinking. Who are you anyway? Who? Playing boss, is it? - I'm a village chief too, asshole. - Who do you think you are? -Let go. - Why are you doing this? - Nuclear waste center? - I'l have to ask you to leave. A small leak and everyone's dead. Three generations will have to suffer! Do you people realize? Let go! Let go. Asshole. You think it'll be easy, to work things out without the approval of the people? Are you that embarrassed of having a chief as a friend? You've become a hardnosed bastard, you know? Sick bastard. We'll see! Fuck you. I heard the meeting was a mess today. One of the chiefs played to bully. He messed up. When's the counterplan committee going to be set up? The day after tomorrow, on Saturday. Appoint him the chairman. Who? The idiot that messed up the meeting. I heard they were friends. Do you think he'll say yes? You think he won't? Listen, who am I? I'm the man that turned a nobody into a member of the Assembly. But he's only a village chief. Don't give me that. Just do it. It'll be exciting to watch. No to nuclear waste center! Step down, dictator magistrate! Step down! Step down NOH Daekyu! Step down! Magistrate, bull shit. He's not even worth a village chief! He's not! Step down NOH Daegyu! Step down! The radiation level... there's the multi-layer disposal method. 30 million of our compatriots. We stay awake... Do you hear me! A tough financial situation... Young bastards! They were swinging their clubs, just take a look at what they've done to me! NOH Daekyu step down! Hey, bastards, you didn't expect this to happen, huh? Let's be frank. You're scared, huh? Is this some kind of a show? - You're right about that. - You really don't have to do this. I've been in riots countless times in college. - Getting a little too dull. - That's child's play, boy. - Isn't there something new? - It's not the same. I'm risking my life right here. - Food delivery? I'll have noodles. - Now you're talking to yourself? - No noodles today? - You're nuts. - No noodles, guys. - Let him talk! Don't paly game. I'll beat you! You son of a... A fast 1st day No nuclear waste center I feel sorry that we only eat. It's tough meat. A fast 2nd day. Hey Choonsam. Hunger strike two days in a row? What is this? Your father's on a fast too, he's looking for you. Hey, wait. A fast 3rd day That's three days without eating. Will he be okay?

How can I possibly do that? I'm looking to back someone with potential. That could be you. Village chief won't help you in that sense. Think on a bigger scale. You understand? I'm not qualified for that. What do you mean you're not qualified? You're the town's most dutiful son. You're looking after your sick father, right? There isn't anyone better. JO.

Apparently he hasn't been seriously injured, but a few of the police, residents and students were injured. Here's LEE Junghoon with the report. What stubbornness? Tell me about it. What's the role of a village chief? He has to take care of this place. But you're doing nothing right now. I'm fed up with being village chief and I'm quitting. Now get out of here!

Is this how I've got to live for the rest of my life? I prepare meals for you till you die? What then? After you die, then? I'm a nobody after you die! I don't know what to do.

Hurry up! Wait, father. Wait. You can eat when the rite is over. I want chicken. Yes, it's all yours. When did he become like this? Long time ago. I pity his misfortune. He raised you three Kids after your mom died and now he's suffering from this illness? His children were all he thought about. Treat him well. Yes, ma'am. And about Daegyu... He might have done something wrong, but please understand and help him out. I consider you and Daegyu as both of my sons. And you two are friends, right? Both of you should succeed.

Good to know that you've finally realized. It's over now. What's over? Magistrate, development, whatever. I'm sorry. Really. Forget it. It's not because of you, nor anyone else.

Why does my mother have to suffer like that? She's been living all her life, looking up at me, you know? Right. I get it. I'm the asshole. So I want to set things right. For you, and you mother. That's what I feel right now. Don't bother. It's unfair! It sucks to be outwitted from people like that! You're nothing different, what have you got to say? Don't talk to me like that. You're done like this, but what about me, huh? I've accomplished nothing in my life. So you want me to be responsible? What have you done for me, asshole! Bastard! You!

Don't use that expression when you're with others. You sound dumb. What do you mean? What's a survey? You do it for research. It's unnecessary repetition of words with similar meanings. Hey, everyone knows what I mean when I say research survey, it's like that Gallop poll thing... It's like saying, ‘completely eliminate'. Yeah, yeah. And you're so smart. ‘small in size'. Okay, okay. So I was saying... ‘dash quickly". Okay, dammit! Why're you shouting at me for? I was only trying to help you. You're still the mighty stubborn ass that you were a long time ago. Only trying to be resourceful... Let's just do our best, okay? Sorry, sir. We've been talking to ourselves. Oh, you shouldn't call me sir... He's the same age, man. College alumni. What alumni?

Once she leaves the hospital, I'm going to move back here. Yeah, it's best to come back to where you've grown. Sure. When I come back here, let me have a go at village chief. Asshole.
