This is a remarkable gathering of musical performers, including some of Prince's closest friends and collaborators... ♪ Just another manic Monday... ...coming together to honor a Grammy-winning legend who set the stage for so many who followed. This is a night of performances alive with the spirit of one of music's true originals, Prince. ♪ Tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999 ♪ ♪ Say it one more time ♪ 2000, zero, zero... Please welcome your host Maya Rudolph. Dearly beloved... It is my honor to welcome youto The Grammy Salute to Prince. Yes. Tonight the Recording Academy celebrates the astounding recording legacyof Prince Rogers Nelson. In his wildly productive time here, Prince created a body of workthat will truly outlive us all. This show, airing four yearsto the day when we lost Prince, is an expression of love and profound respect. I have difficulty putting into words my personal feelings for Prince. There are words that don't exactly cut it for me. Genius, brilliant, gifted, prolific, legendary. They're all true. But they don't really get right to that feeling that can only be described through his music. And when it came to performing, I'm sorry, but Prince still has everyone beat. See, to me, Prince is music. To love Prince is to love music. Even early on in his career, he was at the forefront of constantly pushing boundaries. He was singing about being blackor white, straight or gay, and wishing we all were nude. He spoke to us about God, sexuality, gun control, the nuclear apocalypse, life, death and the afterworld. He said so much so well for so long. And then he was just gone too soon. So tonight we celebrate the enduring spirit of the artist forever known as Prince. So, right now, if I may, let's go crazy... ...with two Grammy-winning greats who love Prince, too, H.E.R. and Gary Clark Jr. ♪ ♪ Dearly beloved ♪ We are gathered here today toget through this thing called ♪ ♪ Life ♪ Are we gonna let the elevatorbring us down? ♪ ♪ Oh, no, let's go ♪ Oh, no, let's go ♪ Oh, no, let's go ♪ Oh, no, let's go ♪ Oh, no, let's go ♪ If you don't like ♪ The world you're living in ♪ Take a look around ♪ At least you got friends ♪ I called my old lady ♪ For a friendly word ♪ She picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor ♪ ♪ "Ah, ah" is all I heard ♪ Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down? ♪ ♪ Oh, no, let's go ♪ Let's go crazy ♪ Let's get nuts ♪ Let's look for the purple banana ♪ ♪ Before they put us in the truck, let's go ♪ ♪ We're all excited ♪ But we don't know why ♪ Maybe it's 'cause ♪ We're all gonna die ♪ And when we do, yeah ♪ When we do♪ ♪ What's it all for? ♪ What's it all for?♪ ♪ Better leave now, before the grim reaper ♪ ♪ Come knockin' on your door ♪ Tell me ♪ Are we gonna let♪ ♪ De-elevator bring us down? ♪ Oh, no, let's go ♪ Let's go crazy ♪ Let's get nuts ♪ Look for the purple banana ♪ Until they put us in the truck ♪ ♪ Let's go...

Please welcome 11-time Grammy winner John Legend. Prince was in every way incomparable. But in his artistry, his musicality, and his ambition, he set the stage for all of us who follow. Prince actually... kept giving away this next song about being incomparable. He gave it away a few times to other artists. But somehow it kept coming back to him. Because as the record shows, nothing compares to Prince. ♪ It's been seven hours ♪ And 13 days ♪ Since you took your love away ♪ ♪ I go out every night ♪ And sleep all day ♪ Since you took your love away ♪ ♪ Since you been gone I can go ♪ Wherever I want ♪ I can see whomever I choose ♪ I can eat my dinner in a fancy ♪ ♪ Restaurant ♪ But nothing, I said nothing ♪ ♪ Can take away these blues ♪ 'Cause nothing compares ♪ ♪ Oh, nothing compares ♪ To you ♪ Nothing... nothing ♪ It's been so lonely without you ♪ ♪ Here ♪ Like a bird without a song ♪ Oh ♪ Nothing can stop these lonely tears ♪ ♪ From falling ♪ Oh, so tell me, baby ♪ Tell me where did I ♪ Go wrong ♪ Hey ♪ I could put my arms around ♪ Every girl I see ♪ But they'd only remind me of you ♪ ♪ Oh, listen ♪ I went to the doctor and guess what he told me ♪ ♪ Guess what he told me ♪ He said, boy, you better try to have fun ♪ ♪ No matter what you do ♪ But he's a fool ♪ 'Cause nothing compares ♪ ♪ Nothing compares ♪ To you ♪ Whoa... ♪ All the flowers that you planted ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ In the back yard ♪ All died when you went away ♪ Yeah ♪ I know, I know that living with you, baby ♪ ♪ Was sometimes hard ♪ Oh ♪ But I'm willing to give it ♪ Another try ♪ Yes, I will, I, oh ♪ 'Cause nothing compares ♪ No, nothing compares ♪ To you now, nothing ♪ Nothing, nothing ♪ Nothing, no ♪ Nothing compares ♪ Nothing compares to you ♪ No, no, no♪ ♪ To you ♪ Oh ♪ To you... ♪ Ooh. ♪ Baby, baby, baby... Prince Rogers Nelson began this thing called life on June 7, 1958 in Minneapolis, Minnesota-- a city he would come to define for a listening world. He would become an iconic global artist. But Prince never completely left his hometown. I'll always live in Minneapolis. OPRAH WINFREY: Do you, do you...? You will alwayslive here? Mm-hmm.Why? It's so cold it keeps the bad people out. I believe that. Prince's first memory was the wink of his mother's eye. Soon followed by the sound of his father's piano. Prince's royal moniker was the same as the stage name of his jazz musician father. The tensions that tore his parents apart when he was ten would resonate powerfully in Prince's work as a musical artist for whom freedom came first. As a teenager, he gradually found a community of gifted players and collaborators in Minneapolis. Yet from the start, Prince would establish himself as a fiercely independent creative force. By the age of 17, Prince was a musical phenomenon. And signed a deal with Warner Bros. Records offering him something he would never stop demanding or earning-- complete creative control.

Ah. It's-- This is just such an emotional evening, I know, for everyone, but, um, it really is an emotional evening for me. Um, I am-am so honored to have had the privilege to tour around the world with Prince. He was a mentor, one of my closest friends and someone who just really showed me what it was to be a unique individual and to own that power. In-in many ways, he inspired me to become the artist that I am today. But I wasn't the only beneficiary of his artistic wisdom and support. Women were front and center in Prince's very musical revolution... ...including an amazing group of female musicians here tonight. This next song was a 1986 smash that Prince wrote under the name Christopher and gave to a fast-rising groupof women named The Bangles. Here to perform "Manic Monday," tonight, from The Bangles, Susanna Hoffs... ...and from Coldplay, Chris Martin. ♪ ♪ 6:00 already ♪ I was just in the middle of a dream ♪ ♪ I was kissing Valentino ♪ By a crystal blue Italian stream ♪ ♪ But I can't be late ♪ 'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid ♪ ♪ These are the days ♪ When you wish your bed was already made ♪ ♪ It's just another manic Monday ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ I wish it were Sunday ♪ Oh, oh ♪ 'Cause that's my fun day ♪ My "I don't have to run" day ♪ It's just another manic Monday ♪ ♪ Have to catch an early train ♪ Got to be at work by 9:00 ♪ And if I had an aeroplane ♪ I still couldn't make it on time ♪ ♪ 'Cause it takes me so long ♪ Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear ♪ ♪ Blame it on the train ♪ But the boss is already there ♪ ♪ It's just another manic Monday ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ I wish it was Sunday ♪ Oh, oh ♪ 'Cause that's my fun day ♪ My "I don't have to run" day ♪ It's just another manic Monday ♪ ♪ Of all of my nights ♪ My lover had to pick last night to come around ♪ ♪ Doesn't it matter I have to feed the both of us? ♪ ♪ Employment's down ♪ He tells me in his bedroom voice ♪ ♪ "Come on, honey, let's go make some noise" ♪ ♪ Time, it goes so fast ♪ And time, it goes so fast ♪ It's just another manic Monday ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ I wish it was Sunday ♪ Oh, oh ♪ 'Cause that's my fun day ♪ Oh, oh ♪ My "I don't have to run" day ♪ It's just another manic Monday ♪ ♪ I wish it was Sunday ♪ 'Cause that's my fun day ♪ My "I don't have to run" day ♪ It's just another manic Monday ♪ ♪ It's just another manic Monday. ♪ ♪ Coming up, it's time for Morris Day and the Time, and then Foo Fighters rock "Darling Nikki."

Once again, Maya Rudolph. Tonight it is fitting that so many gifted artists are saluting Prince, because Prince was openly emphatic about celebrating the influences his musical predecessors had on his life. And Prince even got to play right alongside one of his earliest childhood inspirations, an extraordinary group that, like Prince, broke down barriers for all who follow.

I was blessed to share the stagewith Prince a few times. But the last time I ever saw him was the night Prince took the time to present John Legend and I with our Golden Globe Award for the song "Glory." I was so excited that I hugged Prince. And in a way, that's what allof us are doing up here tonight. We're hugging the memory of an artist like no other. Prince was timeless. Yet he could speak to his times in ways few artists in popular music ever do.

What's the story of that, by the way? Um, well, I, um... Uh, I had searched deep within my heart and spirit, and I wanted to, uh, uh, make a change and move to a new plateauin my life, and one of the ways in which I did that was to change my name. It sort of divorced me from the past and all the hang-ups that go along with it.
