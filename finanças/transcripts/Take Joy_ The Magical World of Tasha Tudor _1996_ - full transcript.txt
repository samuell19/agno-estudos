[birds chirping] Narrator: There is a place in new england where much loved author, artist, and illustrator Tasha Tudor has created her own storybook world. Step into this world and you enter another place, another time. Although she's famous throughout the world for her work and way of life, Tasha Tudor is an intensely private person. This is the first time she has allowed her life story to be documented on film. Tasha Tudor is one of the most prolific and revered illustrators of all time. She has delighted generations of children and their parents with her enchanting paintings in classics like "The secret garden" And "The little princess" As well as those found in her own stories, such as "Pumpkin moonshine" And "Corgiville kidnapping." Tasha: I've always known what I wanted to do, and I've always wanted to be an illustrator, so I am an illustrator. And it's a delightful profession to be an artist. I'm not really a real artist, I'm a commercial artist because I illustrate, but my mother was a painter, so I sort of grew up under her easel, entertaining her victims while she painted. She would always save a good juicy brush for us. And we had a huge bathtub. My brother and I took our bath together. She'd paint a face on our bare stomachs, and when we inflated them or deflated them, the expression on the face changed and it was most entertaining. And you can be an artist, you know, and get away with a lot of things. You can...Be as odd as you wish or as immoral as you wish and they say, "Oh, she's just an artist. What do you expect?" So I think it's a wonderful career. I've never regretted it. I really starting making pictures when my husband's little niece sylvie ann came over from scotland and I decided I'd make her a book, and that was "Pumpkin moonshine." Narrator: "Sylvie ann was visiting her grandmummy "In connecticut. It was halloween "And sylvie wanted to make a pumpkin moonshine, "So she put on her bonnet "And started out for the cornfield to find the very finest and largest pumpkin." [dog barking] This charming story of sylvie ann and her runaway pumpkin quickly became a classic. The themes found in these pages of joy, goodness, celebration, and a love of nature are at the heart of Tasha's life and work. Sylvie plants pumpkin seeds for the future. Little did Tasha know what the seeds from "Pumpkin moonshine" Would grow into. Tasha: I went to every single publisher in new york, and they all turned me down. It was very satisfying, 'cause may massee was editress of viking. And she said, "Oh, your things look like... Too much like a flower catalog." And...And then I went over to the university press, and the person there... Was--it was her first job, and my book was the first one she ever accepted. So I took great and evil satisfaction. When may massee said, "Why didn't you come to me with it?" I'm not a very nice person as far as that goes. I was very pleased to be able to say, "I did once come to you, but you didn't like my pictures." Narrator: Tasha Tudor's art and life are interchangeable. Almost every aspect of her world can be found in her beautiful drawings. Tasha: I always draw from reality. I don't like drawing from photographs, and I refuse to unless I absolutely have to, so that the flowers I draw and the animals I draw I've drawn from real life. [rooster crows] Come on, girls. Come on. You want your supper? Come on, hurry up. Come on. Narrator: Tasha begins and ends each day by milking her goats. Tasha: Come on. Narrator: As a child, Tasha dreamed of owning a small farm in new england. Today, her menagerie of animals includes 3 goats, minou the cat, two parrots, a manx mouse, and a number of finches, doves, and chickens. Tasha: I'm surrounded by animals and that's why I can model them, because I have them right around me. Now, you stand still. Good girl. [goat bleats] Here, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick. [clucking] [meow] Now, look at those lovely eggs. Narrator: And wherever Tasha goes, her faithful corgi companions, rebecca and owen, are sure to follow. Now, rebecca... [barking] Tasha: And I like animals to look like animals and not like cartoons, and I'm very adamant on that subject. I want my animals to look real, and I do think I have succeeded in bringing the breath of life into them. [chirping] There it is. You just wait. I'll get your breeze in a minute. I find that one of the greatest modern improvements is a freezer, because I save road casualties, which are not decayed, and I freeze them. And then I can take them out and thaw them and set them in positions that I want and draw them and put them back and freeze them. I've got an owl in the freezer. It's been there for about 6 years, I think. I have a whole mouse morgue in this freezer here, in very lifelike positions, as they've fallen into rain barrels, poor things, and not been discovered until they're wrapped in death. You want to see it? I have it. Well, I was born in boston in 1915, and my mother and father at that time were living in marblehead, where papa had the first licensed airplane factory in the U.S. He did a lot of early flight and worked with the wright brothers, I know. I don't think he was the first man to take a plane off water, I think a frenchman did that. But I'm sure he was the second. But he had many adventures. And I can recall as a very small child, waking frederic, my brother, and me out of a sound sleep in the early dawn and taking us out to plum island where they did airplane testings because the winds, apparently, were just right there. But instead of watching history, frederic and I slid down sand dunes on pieces of cardboard. It was very entertaining. Papa was a very unusual person. Very eccentric. And the people in marblehead did not like it because he took his young son up in the plane frequently and flew around across marblehead harbor, and they thought that was not right. Narrator: Determined to have fun at the expense of his conservative neighbors, starling burgess devised a plan to drop his son frederic from the plane. Of course he didn't really drop frederic into the harbor. He dressed a 4-foot stuffed bear in frederic's clothes and threw the bear out of the plane. But from a distance, onlookers couldn't tell the difference. Tasha: This was very sensational. When he got back to the dock, the sheriff was there with handcuffs and everything. And I think papa enjoyed himself very much. Narrator: You don't have to look far to find the root of Tasha's fantastic imagination. As well as being a pioneer aviator, starling burgess was a renowned designer of yachts and cars, including this one he created with buckminster fuller. He was also a published poet and an incredible storyteller. Tasha: I never heard anyone read poetry or recite it as papa did. It just game you goosebumps. Narrator: Those who knew starling burgess say that he had a fey, mystical quality. He certainly had an incredible connection with children and animals, both qualities that Tasha inherited. Tasha: My father had a tame seal, whom he was sure she was a beautiful maiden who had been enchanted by a wicked magician. He had a tank for her right off the house, which was on the sea. She'd flip out of it in the afternoon when papa came back and would flap into the room, but she'd get up on the sofa with him and lie down while he read. And she even drove to boston in the front seat of the car with him frequently. And it was his--my father's most endearing name for my mother. He always called her seal. Narrator: From her mother, Tasha inherited her love of painting and a fierce independence of spirit. Tasha: I have come to realize that mama was rather a liberated woman of that time. She kept her maiden name for painting. She was very charming and very lovely-looking, but she was really very adventuresome. Think of her getting a pilot's license and doing all the things she did. When my mother and father were divorced when I was 9, I was sent to live with the nicest family, old family friends of my father's in connecticut. And it was the best thing that ever happened to me. We had the most wonderful time. We ran wild, and you could actually have more than one piece of candy in a day. You could sit up as late as you wanted to. And we were always read out loud to. It was just amazing to a prim and proper child because they were really a wonderful bohemian family, and we had a wonderful time. But I wouldn't go back to it for love nor money because I think growing older is even more exciting, and I'm thoroughly enjoying myself. And as you're all coming to it in due time, you can look forward to it with relish. It's marvelous. ["Simple gifts" Instrumental playing] Narrator: Although Tasha is in her early 80s, her energy and enthusiasm are extraordinary. She attributes this vitality to goat's milk and gardening. Tasha: Doesn't this wet, cooler feel delicious on the soles of the feet. Narrator: Tasha's garden is one of her greatest passions. She feels very connected to the land around her and tends it with care. Tasha: Well, I just think one has to be in touch with nature. I don't believe in spraying things because I think you're all part of the universe yourself, so if you abuse it, you're abusing yourself very blindly. But I will tell you, I'll shoot a deer if she's eating my garden, but that's just self-preservation. This was once a nice arch. I've got to redo it. Narrator: If fairies do exist, you can be sure they would live here. Tasha: Well, this is known as the secret garden, and it's lots of fun to have tea here. But it is so pretty when the tulips are not eaten by predators. I have a constant battle against those and deer, who are as fond of flowers as I am, unfortunately. I just believe it's going to go wild. It's very pleasant. But I love forget-me-nots. "The gloom of the world is but a shadow behind it. It's joy. Take joy." And that's what I do. I like the garden. "He who sows a garden sows happiness." Isn't that an old chinese proverb? But I just love to garden. I can't resist it. And as life is so short, I think it's dreadful to waste it on something that you don't like doing. And this has to be planted. I plant morning glories and scarlet runners on it. I wish I could get one of those motorcyclists who wear those leather suits to come in and cut out the dead roses. I'ii have to attack them someday. And then my greatest pride and joy is my bay tree, who is 36 years old. And I started him from a slip. Well, it wasn't any bigger than that, and I love him. I'm very proud of him. But, you see, I'm a great boaster anyway about my plants. My favorite saying is thoreau's quotation from walden, that, "If one advances confidently "In the direction of his dreams "And endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with success unexpected in common hours." I think that's-- that's my philosophy. And to take joy. Because the gloom of the world is but a shadow. Don't you agree? Narrator: In the late 1930s, Tasha got married and soon had 4 children of her own. Other times were often hard, and Tasha had to support the family with her illustrating. She was determined that her children would have a childhood as wonderful as her own. Tasha: The children that I drew before I had any children look exactly like the ones I had. So I think that was wishful thinking. The children grow up, but they remain children in the sketch books, so I can refer to them when I need to draw them. I have many, many, many of them, and they're my most valued possessions. But that's one of the nice things about being an artist. You can sort of play god and make the world look the way you want it to. [piano playing] I've always been interested in dolls as long as I can remember. I had a bride doll I loved dearly. And of course I'd read "The little princess," With a doll in that, you know. And when I had children of my own, I actually started making dolls for them. The gentleman sitting in the chair is captain thaddeus crane. And then I made emma, who is my galatea. I feel just as pygmalion did about galatea, so-- but her name is emma because I had a favorite aunt called emma. Narrator: Tasha's dolls are part of the family. Like the velveteen rabbit, the dolls have been loved so much that they have become real to Tasha and her 4 children. And Tasha immortalized them in classics like "A" Is for annabelle," "A dolls' christmas," And "Becky's christmas." The distinction between reality and fantasy is often blended in Tasha's world. Nowhere is this more true than in an extraordinary correspondence that took place between the dolls and members of Tasha's family. Oh, well, it was called the sparrow post. And letters were delivered by birds, naturally. And each child had a sparrow post box attached to their door, and that was a big thing when they came home from school to see if there was any mail in it. And you see the letter? Look at the tiny mouse writing, and he made this enchanting christmas card. See, it's all them wishing merry christmas to emma. Narrator: "We had a small post office in those days. "Valentines came by sparrow post. "The doll family received valentines. "So did all the corgis. And miss puss got a catnip mouse." This is a valentine, I think, that bethany made for the dolls. It says "Forget me not" Inside. Bethany's my older daughter. And we also had a sort of a sears, roebuck catalog run by a mr. Mouse of mouse mills. And here's a catalog here. The order forms you see on the back. I only have a few left. They were very popular. You see the total buttons and mr., mrs., or miss, suggestions for improvements. And here's--these are for the doll ladies. A spring ball gown, "As delicate and appealing as march roses." And these really came. I mean, the children could order them and they'd come in due time. They say they're all priced 20 buttons. And you had to actually send the buttons. There was no charge accounting. Oh, it was fun. I enjoyed it more than the children. And these are bonnets by madame tweedy, who was a starling and very fine at making excellent bonnets. The children all thought that mouse mills made them. They didn't realize that mother made them privately. Narrator: "On labor day, "We used to hold the dolls' fair. "All the dolls came, of course, and their friends. "We used buttons for money. "You could buy cakes and pies and anything else you wanted, all for buttons. It was great fun." One of the biggest events in the doll family was a wedding. In 1955, captain thaddeus crane married a beautiful french doll called melissa. Tasha: The wedding was quite an event. We had sent out formal invitations, which were formally answered. Oh, it was very properly done. Then we had wedding cake and punch, and all the children had daisy wreaths. It was really very pretty. Narrator: The dolls' wedding did not just appeal to Tasha's friends and family, it made headlines and was profiled in the pages of "Life" Magazine. But the doll family, like all families, is not without its scandals. The marriage came to an abrupt end when Tasha made emma. Tasha: I think she's absolutely beautiful. And, of course, captain crane unfortunately preferred emma to melissa. See, now melissa lives upstairs. And I've never held a wedding for them, but isn't that up to modern times? It's all done that way now. And, uh, so that's the scandal in the family. But every family has skeletons in the closet, and so do the dolls. This one I like so much because you've done a replica of this for--for, um, for emma. And I'm very impressed with this one. They were so real to the children, the dolls, and to me. Even though I'm 80, I still love to play with them and make clothes. I love to make dolls' clothes. We could take that out and fold the top of the apron down. Yes, I think... So it's just a... That's what I do with my apron. [Tasha crowing and clucking] [laughing] I've always wanted to do marionettes and have since I was a child. I started first with marbles tied in paper napkins and attached to sewing thread. And I had to give our barnyard rooster quite a haircut in order to obtain the feathers for this boy. But he never held it against us. He said he felt it was worth it for art's sake. These are not puppets. Puppets are run on the hand, and this is a marionette. Narrator: "Midsuummer's eve comes in june. "That's when we had a marionette show. "There were many, many rehearsals. "Marionettes to make-- "Scenery to paint-- "And programs to print and color. "The play was at night in the carriage shed. "Grandmothers had the very best balcony seat. "Refreshments were served at the intermissions, and everyone had a wonderful time." Tasha: We called ourselves the red rooster marionettes. The children made quite a lot of pocket money because we would be hired by people to give shows, and I had a wonderful wolf. We thought it was quite convincing, because the younger children in the audience would cry when he got granny, who really fell behind the bed. Narrator: The red rooster marionettes began with simple shows, such as "Little red riding hood," But soon began putting on more elaborate productions. "Sir lancelot and the dragon of corbin" Featured more than 40 marionettes, as well as a fire-eating dragon. Tasha: We gave a show at the natural history museum in new york. We had to take edgar crow with us, edgar allan crow, because we couldn't leave him at home. He spent most of the time in the bathtub at the hotel. Seth and bethany, who were some of the chief manipulators, my two older children, of the marionettes, got lost in the environs of the natural history museum. They finally turned up amongst the egyptian tombs. But it was a great relief to see them. That always brings down the laughs. Narrator: Tasha and her family still put on marionette shows for friends and neighbors in a theater attached to the barn. And Tasha has ambitious plans for future productions. Tasha: I've always wanted to do a marionette show of "The legend of sleepy hollow," Which I think would be loads of fun to do. And we figured out how we can make ichabod crane racing away, by he has two big rollers, and ichabod will just gallop in the center of the stage, but two grandchildren will turn the rollers and it will appear that he's racing away from the headless horseman. That would be fun to do. I want to do that. [piano playing] I think one of the most important things you can do for your children is to give them very happy memories of their childhood, and I feel I succeeded very well in that point. You can ask any one of my children and they'll agree with me. [birds chirping] Narrator: Everything in Tasha Tudor's life has purpose. Tasha grows many of her own fruits and vegetables and has an extensive herb garden situated on the crest of a hill. Tasha: I have chervil and... Uh, thyme, tarragon. They're down here. And then we could put a few sage leaves in, I guess. Mm. Well, my most favorite is lavender and rosemary. I love them. But I like thyme, and I like some are savory and dill. I don't have any dill. I've got to sow some. Now, you don't need to help, rebecca. Now, come on. Rebecca. Narrator: As well as using the herbs in her cooking, Tasha dries them for teas and uses the oils for ointments and skin creams. You know, garlic, chives, they're good. That ought to do it. Now to get that bird stuffed. [piano playing] Narrator: The kitchen is the heart of Tasha's home, and cooking is one of her favorite occupations. Tasha's scottish nanny dady taught her to cook at a young age, and Tasha continued this tradition with her own children. Tasha has many old-fashioned tools and utensils in her kitchen. One of her favorite possessions is a tin kitchen, which roasts chickens and turkeys in front of the fire. This is a tin kitchen, exactly like the one I have that belonged to my great-grandmother, which we just--we cook on. But look at that. Wonderful. It was made by a man in horseheads, new york. And what a beautiful job he did. You see, you open it and it sits in front of the fire. It's like a reflector oven. And it's a truly-- it truly roasts something. It doesn't bake it the way one does in an oven. You see, it lifts up in back so you can baste it. But anyway, there he is, and then this has to go up. This is a corgi foil. 'cause they get after the drippings. But they have everything. It's a very well-equipped kitchen. I love little things. Narrator: There are worlds within worlds at corgi cottage, and the distinction between worlds is not always immediately obvious. No, he definitely needs oiling. He whistles and flutters his wings. It's unbelievable. And you see how tiny he is. But I've got to take him to new fame. And look at his key in the shape of a bird. You see? Isn't that nice? I love him. He's a real treasure. Oh, there he goes. Look. See? [tweeting] He's actually moving. Can you see him? [chirping] [whispering] All right. Narrator: For those fortunate enough to be invited to corgi cottage, a treat is in store. The meals Tasha prepares are reminiscent of childhood-- mashed potatoes, roast chicken, homemade goat's milk ice cream. We have probably all dreamed of a grandmother who would make such delicious and comforting things. Hello. How are you? All right. Narrator: No matter what she's doing, Tasha's sense of fun is close at hand. One of her favorite pranks is to pretend to serve a live parrot to her guests, to see how they'll react. I can pick her up, too, if you want to see her do that. Ohh...[clicks tongue] He's an african fricassee. He's very fat. Look at that. My, you'd be good eating. This bird was cooked in the tin kitchen that's been in my family for many generations, and it's really good cooked this way, as you will discover in a few minutes. I'm not very good at carving. I'm good at hacking. It seems to be nice and tender. [piano playing] And my favorite book of all the books I've ever done is "Corgiville fair." Narrator: The fair is one of the most important events in any rural community. And in the book "Corgiville fair," Tasha tells the story of young caleb corgi's bid to win the goat race. Caleb has been training with his beloved josephine for months. But then along comes edgar tomcat, who is determined to ruin caleb's chances of victory. Edgar feeds cigars to josephine and gives caleb a sleeping potion. Caleb is out of the race. But then along comes the bogarts to save the day. [crowd cheering] "Corgiville fair" Is a delightful and entertaining tale, but like all great children's literature, it is allegorical. It is a story about the importance of community, tolerance, and good overcoming evil. Tasha: I'm working on a sequel to "Corgiville fair," Called "The great corgiville kidnapping," Which is really quite something. It's a mystery story. I wrote the story and the pictures came secondarily, which is curious, I think, 'cause I have trouble with words. Are you going to swim? She always tries to drink the pond. But overall these are lovely. She didn't go in this morning. All right. You didn't go in swimming. You didn't want to go swimming? Come on, come on, come on. Look at the way she sways her hips. It's quite indecent. Very alluring. But I am addicted to corgi dogs, and I've had them for a long time. I think they're the best dogs ever. [whispering] You're a nice dog. Yes, you see me. But I think it's because my ancestors, a lot of them, came from wales. Maybe I'm part corgi myself. Now, this is sandra amelia corgi. Not made out of fur. She's a very nice little dog. She's interested in drawing, as you see. I very rarely am quite satisfied in what I do. Someday I'll really astonish you. In all the many drawings I've done, there are about 5 that I'm really proud of. It's like hunting the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. You never quite get there. ["Simple gifts" Playing] Narrator: Tasha has not just been successful at creating a remarkable private life, she has had extraordinary success in the outside world. Tasha has illustrated more than 87 books and received many awards, including the regina medal and caldecott honors. She has also published a cookbook and is the subject of 3 well-known books about her way of life. Tasha is beloved by hundreds of thousands of fans and regularly travels around the country giving talks about her life and work. Tasha's magic kingdom does not just exist at corgi cottage. She takes the magic with her wherever she goes. Tasha: Well, I never thought I'd be successful. Because I was always known as poor rasmus' daughter. They thought I was going to be a big problem, which I probably was to them. I never got through the eighth grade, though. I was a despair and the teachers gave me up as a lost cause. So I'm frightfully pleased that I've succeeded, because one usually has to die to succeed. I know I lead two lives, you see-- there's granny who lives here, and then there's Tasha Tudor who people seem to think is quite glamorous, but that's dandy with me. I hope they continue. [piano playing] Narrator: Rituals play an important role in Tasha's life. [indistinct chatter] Narrator: Even simple everyday occurrences like afternoon tea are moments to be savored. Life is unhurried at corgi cottage. Nothing seems rushed. Yet Tasha is one of the most productive people you will ever meet. Tasha is also a great creator of traditions. Birthdays are very special events at corgi cottage. For the children, Tasha created flotillas of birthday cakes in a nearby stream, and even the dogs get a hamburger cake. [wind whistling] [piano playing "God rest you, merry gentlemen"] Christmas is perhaps the most magical time of year at corgi cottage. Tasha has illustrated many classic christmas stories, like "The night before christmas," And her christmas cards and advent calendars are traditions in their own right. "Christmas eve was a magical time. "When dark fell, we stepped into the starlit night "To follow a winding path lighted by candles "To an enchanting creche in the woods. "And on christmas night, "We had the loveliest celebration of the year, "With a beautiful tree and a shine of candles to remind us of peace on earth and loving-kindness." [piano playing] Tasha: Oh, that rain's so nice. Just what the garden ordered. Doesn't it smell good? Narrator: Someone once wrote about Tasha's father, "He is one of the most charming men of this world, "But with all his brilliance, he is a child, and that is part of his charm." Cynics among us may look at the world Tasha has created with skepticism and accuse Tasha of escaping from reality by creating an imaginary world. Tasha: Come on, dogs, want to go pond? Narrator: But Tasha is not escaping from reality. Rather, she is choosing to create the world the way she imagines it. Tasha: I've always lived in a world of imagination. Maybe it's because I'm a coward and hide my head in the sand and don't want to see the real world. I don't know. But I can assure you, it's a very delightful way to live. I'm an eternal optimist. I've never had a headache, and I've never felt depressed. I mean, my children say, "Mummy, you've had such a hard life." But that's nonsense. My whole life has been a vacation. And I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. As oscar wilde said, "We're all in the gutter, but a few of us are looking at the stars." And I think it pays to look at the stars. I'm really not afraid of anything that I can think of, 'cause I can handle a gun, and I'm quite self-sufficient. I have a bad reputation that way. And I'm not even afraid of dying. I think it must be quite exciting, really, because I have no--i have no regrets, in other words. When I die, I'm going right back to the 1830s, which was a delightful period in my past life. I'm quite certain that I lived in the 1830s. I've never been regressed, and that interests me because several of my friends have and they all want to go back to grecian or egyptian days and be priestesses or princesses, but I would just like to go back to being a sea captain's wife in ipswich in-- from 1800 to 1840. And I really wouldn't go back to youth for anything. Mr. Shaw was quite right when he said, "Youth is wasted on youth." Because when you get older, you enjoy things more intensely. And in spite of forgetting where I put my glasses the last time I sat down, I'm having the time of my life, I can assure you. That meant to be a rabbit and it's a mouse. Narrator: Tasha's philosophy of taking pleasure in the simple joys of life is beautifully summed up in one of her favorite poems by evelyn underhill. "I come in the little things, "Saith the lord, "Yea, on the glancing wing of eager birds, "The softly pattering feet of furred and gentle beasts. "I come in the little things, saith the lord, "Not borne on the morning's wings of majesty, "But I have set my feet amidst the delicate and bladed wheat. I come in the little things, saith the lord." Taking pleasure in simple things. Being connected to nature. Celebrating everyday life. These are the things that Tasha Tudor reminds us of. She shows us what is possible if we put our hearts and imaginations to work. [meow] It's all finished. But fairy tale endings often happen. That's a good dog. [kissing sounds] I mean, look at the success I've had, and I never thought I'd had it, but I always was determined, and I was always looking for the pot of gold and the end of the rainbow, and I think I've more or less found it. [chicken clucking]
