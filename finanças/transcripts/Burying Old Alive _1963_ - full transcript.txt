Good evening viewers and studio audience. Today, we have invited some scholars for an open discussion on the serious problems of overpopulation we face today. First, a question for a professor of Biology. 725 rats are born per rat every year. I guess rats need population control more than we do. However, when there's a shortage of food, rats will eat each other to avoid dying out. Well, maybe people should do that, too! How about a comment from a professor of history? In the past, many populations faced near annihilation during times of famine and war. So it used to be customary for parents over seventy years old to be carried up to top of the mountain to die. Now, what are your thoughts? You look over seventy. If you lived in those days, you would have been abandoned in the mountains by now! Nonsense! I am destined to live a hundred years. It says so on my palm. At this rate, we'll never get the population under control!

Directed by Kim Ki-young Yaha, I have arrived at last! Taesan, the high mountain! Daehasu, the deep sea! I drifted tens of millions of miles in the wind and at last I have come to answer the call of the Mountain Spirit and the Earth Spirit. Leave your offering here for a good marriage! This Ancient Tree is the keeper of this village! The tree has uncovered every theft, adultery, and murder and all the perpetrators have been hanged here! Do you remember how much it cost me when I married you? The children from your previous marriage have ruined me! They chased me away! I am bankrupt after four marriages. Come along! You will pay for getting rid of me! May I be struck down by lightning if I'm wrong! Anyone home? What on earth? Don't be alarmed. You are the fifth daughter-in-law. The others didn't even last three days in this house. He has ten children by his former wives. Mother, let me bow to you. You have a new brother now. Guryong, you are my son now. Bow to me and call me father. Father. Bastard, what gives you the right to call him father? Beat him up! Stop it, boys! Stop it, I say! The soil here has turned into sand. Many starve to death during famines. We can't eat to our hearts' content. That is true everywhere. It is a sin to be full. True. Mama, will they feed us tomorrow? Mama got married so that you will not go hungry. For that, you can't sleep with me from now on, okay? Okay. Idiot, can't even eat with his own two hands? He's acting like a retard. Oh, it is such a big flaw. I can't possibly tell anyone. I plan to pass on the housework to my new daughter-in-law. I've asked many times and my fortune-teller keeps predicting that the ten brothers will die at the hands of the new son. Those who harm me will get what they deserve. The ten brothers will hang from the Ancient Tree some day! I'm scared. I'm scared. To be a part of the village, you must follow tradition. Whoever turns seventy must pass the rice bowl to the next generation and be carried up on the son's back to the Sacred Peak to die. One can die comfortably up on the Sacred Peak. Overnight, your flesh and spirit rise up to the heavens, leaving just the bones. I am already seventy. I stayed longer because there was no daughter-in-law. The gods must be angry. When you are seventy, you must go up the mountain too. I must ask you for one last favor. The shaman's prediction worries me... Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma's probably all bones by now. They say if you pray really hard before you die up there, The Divine Spirit grants you one wish. Grandma said she'll pray for us so the bastard won't kill us all. Shut up! Mom, can I have a potato? No. It's unfair to your brothers. But I lit the fire for you. All right. Make sure they don't see you. Okay. Here you go. That bastard! Her son's the only one with a mouth? They will let us all starve to death! Drag him out to the backyard! Eat quickly, child. Ah, it's hot. Your balls will fall off if you play in the kitchen. Open your mouth. I smell potato! Come here. You know what these are? They are tiger teeth. You want these? Yes. If you can catch us, they're yours. Are you in? Yes. Blindfold him. Now clap! Here! We're over here! I'm right here! Catch me if you can! We're over here! Guryong! Who put that snake there? It was me. You rascal! Grandma went to the shaman and she said that Guryong was going to kill us all! What? Never mind. He's so crazy about that woman he doesn't care if we live or die! Cheol handles snakes better than a snake charmer. I read his fortune. This one's destined to kill all his stepbrothers. Please save my son. I lost my husband and five sons in the last famine. I only managed to save this one. Let's send the dead spirits on to the next world. Rice cakes! Don't eat it. It's for the ghosts. Guryong. Mom, I don't care if we starve. Let's leave. Yes, let's leave. If you can stand hunger, you're not afraid of anything. The shaman said Guryong's strong chi will kill off everyone else to survive. We should go. Give us a little piece of land to live on. He's crippled, and all for a few bowls of rice! Father! Father! Go away! Father! Father! Get away from me! Father! You scoundrels! Twenty years later Would you like some water? Farming must be twice as hard for you. I may be an invalid, but I've managed to get a house and some land. What about a woman? I need a short one. A cow gives birth to one calf at a time, but rats can have ten. Why don't you marry a hen? She'll lay you 365 eggs a year. Meet me later? And ruin myself? Guryong. Yes? If you're meeting Gannan today, make sure you wet this towel and bring it back. Don't let this one go. No woman will ever want a cripple. Here. I have to go. Mama says Guryong's a poor thing. Life's hard enough even with all your limbs working fine. Don't look at my legs when you talk. I have nothing against it. It's not that I don't like it. Gannan, shh... Mama says if you do it in the grass you'll have the child of a snake. Shh,Gannan. Mama says if Guryong asks to sleep with you, tell him it's an unlucky period. Mama says Guryong's a widow's son and needs to take care of his mama. Don't talk about mother. Guryong's about to get married, and you're just laying there? The ten brothers are still bachelors! I married five times without anyone's help! We'll get the provisions for marriage if we take back the land we gave Guryong. We lost that land to him because of a snake bite! If we lost it, we should get it back! Brother. Guryong dug up a ginseng root at Cloud Rock! That rascal! He's found his marriage provisions. Bow. The groom bowed first! For heaven's sake, this is so embarrassing. He's pathetic! A man can make mistakes every once in a while! But if a bride farts while bowing, she will never be forgiven! Quiet! Bow, now. Just think of a man as a large python. Even if it's terrifying, or if it gives you gooseflesh, or if it tickles, you have to hold it all in. Here, look. This is a man. Feed my son-in-law plenty of pork! Boars have great stamina! They can produce ten piglets at a time. Having lots of children is good, but I'm worried one of them might be a cripple. Shut up! Okay, let's send him into the bride's room. If we keep him too long, he might have a little accident outside the gates. Here we go. Here he comes, here he comes. Here comes the large python. She's finished! My daughter is finished! It is her fate. Child! Give me the headdress and the gown. They were rented. In the garden of the bride's house. The in-laws are having a chat.

Did you bring the land deeds? I heard rumors your brothers violated the new wife. She ran away, and we kept her at our house. Are you aware that the penalty for violating another's wife is hanging on the Ancient Tree at the shaman's place? We did no such thing. I swear on my life. As the ten brothers take Guryong's wife outside, Guryong is shocked. She is crying. You would really risk your life? Why don't you ask her? Mutes can't talk, but they can gesture. Those villains!

Guryong cuddles her and lies down with her on the ground. The ceiling is seen in her eyes. Strange. Someone throws a pebble here every night. Maybe a virgin from the village wants to see you. Look. There are no virgins in this village. Huh? Who is it? Give us the mute! Where is she? Give us the mute, or we'll burn your house down. Look at this knife! What can we do? She can't hear anyone or say anything. She just has to guess what's going on. She left everything to me and set out for the mountain She died thinking she deserves it because she's a mute. Never bother me again. Fifteen years later Three years of drought, and I'll die of thirst before I die of hunger. I bought this water from the ten brothers in exchange for potatoes. Potatoes. Potatoes. We've had three years of famine. We don't have a single potato left. Our house is the only one in the village with a well. You should share. No way! Has anyone in this village ever given us a sip of water? Still, have mercy. Get out of the way! What's all this? Quiet, all of you! She did not fall to her death. She died of starvation. Anyone dare argue with me? Has anyone ever given us a single potato? Give her a sip of water for the last time. Show everyone we are good people. Shit, we can't get money for water anymore. Let's get rid of the freeloader before we starve. Send father up to the mountain. You fools, I don't even drink water. If you go up the mountain you won't even have to. If I have to die, I'll die here. I'm not going up the mountain. Don't make a mockery of our family. just give up your rice bowl for us. How dare you! Father, you're being unreasonable. How about this? We'll toss a coin and if it's tails you go up the mountain. Don't worry father. The Divine Spirit will protect you. It's heads! Look! The Divine Spirit is on your side! Don't put too much faith in the Divine Spirit. We'll get tails before ten days pass. With this many potatoes, I can buy all the land in the village. Of course, I'll only save whatever's leftover after you've had your fill. You shouldn't take other people's land for nothing. These potatoes are expensive! They were grown by the damned cripple who worked ten, twenty times harder to produce them. I can't sell that piece of land for two sacks of potatoes! It's better than starving to death! You could be a little kinder at times like these! Forget it! Don't expect kindness from an invalid! Will you or will you not sell? Crook. Grandma! Grandma! Mother! What brings you here? The children are about to starve to death! I came hoping you could help us. There's nothing to drink in our village, let alone food. Say hello to your grandmother! Grandma, hello! Darling, this is my mother. Mother, the children are starving. Please give them something to eat. Grandma, I'm hungry. Darling. Where did grandpa hide the potatoes? Doesn't matter. My nose will find them. Quickly! Where is it? Search over there. It's not here either. If I had known we would starve at my parents' house too, I wouldn't have brought us all here. Go borrow some potatoes. Didn't Guryong have anything for you? I can't go there. Our children are about to die. This is not the time to save face. What if we can't find them? Where are they? Quick, find them! Over here. It's over here. - Look! - Potatoes! Dear, dear... Children! You rascals! These are seed potatoes! If the drought ends, the two of us will die without the seed potatoes. Stop! Stop! Water... Mom, we have water! Guryong, Gannan is here. What do you want? The children are about to die. She's here to borrow a sack of potatoes. Where is your shame? And is there no shame in a cripple asking for a woman with working limbs? Guryong! What? Cripple? I hear you're buying land with potatoes. You're beating women now? I'll loan you the potatoes. I am also a mother who starved all her children, except one. Let's go inside. You promised you wouldn't come here. Now that I've had my revenge, life has become so empty. We're very lonely people. We have no relatives, and we couldn't help anyone either. I should have said this earlier, but won't you send me up to the mountain? Mother. If I pray up in the mountain and it rains, people will say there was once an old lady whose prayer was granted. Mother, I live for you. I know. What else would a cripple like me live for? What's going on? You've found water in this well? If everyone digs a well, we can't sell our water anymore. You said you wouldn't bother me anymore! Get the corpse! Let's go. I hate grandma! Isn't this the last of the loaned potatoes? If I die and you become a widow, no-one will marry you before the three-year mourning period ends. You should remarry before I die. Who'll take a woman with nine children? Try Guryong. Convince him to take you in. Do it before I die. You can't drink that water. Why not? The ten brothers dropped a corpse in there. I can stand the hunger, but I can't stand the thirst. Do you want some leftover potatoes? Let's go inside. Are you sure it'll be okay? Don't worry about Guryong. I'm ashamed. Go on. A woman is never full. When a woman is young, she's afraid of her in-laws. When she has children, they eat everything. When she's old, her stomach shrinks so she can't eat much. I wish someone would buy my body. Will you give us a child? I would like to raise one. Send a girl. She'll be of help around the house. They're all so young. The younger the live-in bride, the better. It's easier to teach her. Would any of you leave to become a stepchild? I'll give you these potatoes. You? You? You? You? I'll go. You all call me pockface and treat me poorly. I'd rather go live there. Here she is. You won't miss home if you came to live with us? A woman is not supposed to be homesick after she marries. You are bright. I'm good at housework and I'm devoted to my husband. Ok. I've decided to take in a child. You're a pockface. I'm a pockface, but only a little bit. He's the master of this house. Pay your respects. Please keep me from going hungry, mister. Forget it. They already call this the freak house, and you brought in a pockface? Damn. Look! Mister's a cripple! Clip clop clip clop! Here's your meal. What are you looking at? Mama always sat beside father during his meals. In case he chews on any stone bits. Try the vegetables. I made them. It's a bit bland. Maybe it's because the pockface made it. A cripple picking on a pockface? You're one to talk! In Gannan's garden, while Gannan and her children are waiting, Yeon arrives.

Being a good son is important, but it is a great crime against the ancestors to discontinue the bloodline. Gannan avoids her. I might have to secretly leave for the mountain. Gannan holds Guryong's mother. Gannan holds Guryong's mother. You have to take good care of him. If you serve him well, he'll soon get over the sorrow of being a cripple. Gannan is sadly sobbing. Gannan is sadly sobbing. He wasn't born a cripple, so the child will be fine. Mother. Guryong's mother goes out to the garden to head for the mountain. Guryong's mother goes out to the garden to head for the mountain. Guryong's mother is climbing a hill and panting. Guryong questions Gannan in the living room.

Guryong questions Gannan in the living room. Guryong questions Gannan in the living room. Guryong questions Gannan in the living room. She said you depend on her and don't wanna get married. She left everything to me and set out for the mountain to offer her body to the Divine Spirit. What? It was your idea, wasn't it? You talked her into leaving for my sake, didn't you? You sent her off to the Divine Spirit! No, no! You thought the cripple would be desperate enough to abandon his mother for a woman? What kind of an imbecile deserts his mother to take care of nine children who belong to someone else? Guryong, Guryong. He pushes and treads on Gannan as she grabs hold of him. He pushes and treads on Gannan as she grabs hold of him. Mama, mama. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Yeon comes in and pulls them apart. Mongrel! Swine! Die! Get out. I turned a blind eye when you stole potatoes from my hut, and now you chase away an old woman to the mountain? Mother. He dashes out to find his mother. He dashes out to find his mother. He dashes out to find his mother. I can't steal to feed us all anymore. Yeon, don't tell father that we took a beating. He'll be heartbroken. It will kill him if he finds out we got battered because of hunger. Mother. Mother... Now he is looking for his mother on the mountain path. Now he is looking for his mother on the mountain path. Now he is looking for his mother on the mountain path. Mother. He sees her behind some rocks at a distance and then gets closer to her. He sees her behind some rocks at a distance and then gets closer to her. He sees her behind some rocks at a distance and then gets closer to her. Don't come near me. Stop thinking about saving your mother. You should be thinking about having children with Gannan. Mother, let's return to the village. Even dogs and swine are slaughtered after they bear children. It's a sin for a man not to have children. This is absurd. I can't exchange my own mother for a wife. He returns with his mother on his back. He returns with his mother on his back. He returns with his mother on his back. We've been praying for three years and the famine hasn't ended. The elderly have gone up to the mountain, but it won't rain. It is time we summon Saetaenim to reveal the transgressions. What's Saetaenim? It's the spirit of a dead child. Go buy a sacrificial child. I'll buy one. I can buy a child with a sack of potatoes. Here. Mama, I'm hungry. Here, drink some water. Soo! Soo! I've come to buy a sacrificial child. It's a sin to starve your children to death. I hear the pockfaced girl took a beating from Guryong. If she becomes Saetaenim, Guryong will surely be ruined. Potatoes! No! No! Shoo! Shoo! Sell the pockfaced girl. If you live another day, you'll find another opportunity to live on. Gather up the potatoes. Lady, this is no time to be mourning over the dead child. You should save what you have left. You! Didn't Guryong chase you from his house? Pockface will always be taunted. Pockface deserves to die. Be a Saetaenim. Go away, you pigs! Uncle Guryong is waiting for us to starve and die. Mama, I'm going to accept the potatoes from the shaman's house. Yeon! I don't care if I die as long as I don't starve to death. Yeon! I hate Uncle Guryong. Yeon! Here she comes. I've come for the potatoes. - Bring the potatoes. - Yes. Here. You don't care if the shaman kills you? Being hungry is worse than death. I'm worried mother and father will forget about me by the time they finish eating these potatoes. I hear Gannan sold Yeon to the shaman for potatoes rather than letting the other children starve. The shaman has no potatoes. They were the ten brothers'. What? I want to buy back Yeon. I'll give you ten sacks of potatoes. The lives of the villagers are depending on Saetaenim. If you pull her out now, they'll come after you. How do you catch a child's spirit? If you stab her with a bamboo needle, the spirit goes into the shaman. Where will Saetaenim's spirit rest? Not hell, not heaven, and not my house. I want to stretch my legs and rest on the bull's eye of the shaman's fan. Saetaenim, where will you go? I shall visit the underworld, read the Book of Fortunetelling and learn about people's fates. I shall return stolen goods to the rightful owners. The spirit crosses over! Catch her with the fan! Here she comes. The offering! Something large to get her going! Grandmother Geum, you first. I am now seventy. It is time for me to give myself up at the Sacred Peak, yet my good son would not let me go. What should I do? Saetaenim descends! I have read the fate hidden in the Underworld! If you ascend the Sacred Peak on your good son's back, nine spirits will gather rain and save your people! Mother, I will not abandon you. Not even over my dead body. All it takes is my life to save many others! Saetaenim, I will gladly burn in hell for letting my children die, but what will become of the remaining seven? Your offering! I can't even afford an offering for my own dead child! Saetaenim wants your offering. I have seen! I have seen! I have read the fates! Mother, dry your tears and hear your child's wishes! Go to the house on the east side after midnight and all your wishes will be granted. Uncle Guryong, grant all my mother's wishes! I shan't eat. It is a sin for an old, useless woman like me to squander the gift of heaven while the young ones starve. Yeon is a good girl. We shouldn't have looked down on her for being a pockface. The young child has told her mother to ask you for a favor. You can't turn her down. I was going to buy her back with some potatoes. Take them. Take them. If I take them, I'll be selling Yeon twice. Yeon's Saetaenim told me to entrust my body in your hands. The starvation is making me dizzy. I want to eat well from now on. When you were a virgin, you ran away. You ran away all those years ago, calling me a cripple. Look at you now. Hush. Yeon might give you a child. I will try to sculpt one who has your nose and eyes. Hey, this way Potatoes! Mine! Ow, hot! Stop right there. Are you just giving up your wife and children and walking away? Are you being compassionate? What! If Guryong steals someone's wife and kills the husband, we can hang the bitch and the bastard. We want Guryong! Look at this poor man. He had his wife stolen and lost his life, too. Guryong killed him! - I know nothing about this! - Isn't this your sickle? This is Guryong's. If we let this go, the ten brothers can steal wives and kill their husbands, too! Kill him! Kill him! Hang the bitch and bastard! Wait! Hold on a second! If you let us live, we'll give you the land documents and potatoes! Hang them! If we kill them, the potatoes and land documents will be ours. - Pull! - Guryong! Guryong! Save my child! You can't kill an innocent person! Shut up, hag! With all these normal people starving to death, a cripple's death is no big deal. It was you ten brothers who turned Guryong into a cripple! You hag! Mother! Mother! Guyrong! My son, Guryong! I will save you! You old fox My son. My son, Guryong. Will anyone save my son? Shaman! Didn't Saetaenim tell us yesterday that it would rain if this old lady is sent up the mountain? A man who committed adultery with someone else's wife, and killed her husband must be punished by death! If you send this old crone up the mountain on my son's back, I'll make it rain and the village will be prosperous again. Please? Shaman, please save him. Whatever it takes for the rain to come. If you want to save your son, you'll pray for rain with your sincerest heart. Yes. It is not going to rain! Bring the back rack! If it doesn't rain, you may kill him! Bring it over! Cut him loose. Mother. Guyrong. Mother, please forgive your son. For sacrificing you for my sin! I am happy to do anything for you. When you were born, I was happy to be in pain and I was happy to watch you grow. I am also happy to go up the mountain on your back. God, here we go again. Come on. You must return before sundown. We can rest if you're tired. It's nothing compared to dying. I was angry then. I remarried to feed you, but turned you into a cripple instead. Perhaps there is no joy in life. But raising you gave me joy. I used to stay up at night watching you sleep. Because you didn't get married, I was able to look after you until I turned seventy. I am a lucky mother. Being on your back makes me drowsy, like a child. Do you remember the lullaby you used to sing? Sing it. My mother used to sing this to me. When I die, my mother will disappear without a trace from this world! What should I do? Plod, plod, wanderer. To where do you plod crying? To where my mother lies sleeping Once more to be her suckling. Hang on tight, mother. There's no turning back now. I'm worried that you won't be able to return. This is no time to be worrying about me, mother. You're my only worry in the world. Do not go. I'll give you gold. Do not go. I'll give you silver. Don't want no gold, Don't want no silver. I'll go where my mother lies sleeping. Be careful. - Uncle! - Geon! Geon! Here. Guryong, let me see your face one last time. With your beard grown, you lookjust like your father. Your father never had a kind word for me since the day we met, and he died without a word. Be good to Gannan. A woman has no one to trust but her husband. Here. Get up. Guryong. Take care of yourself after you marry. You can't make several children at a time. If you try too hard to make up for lost time, you'll wear yourself out. Now, go! Guryong. Can't you walk properly just this once? I think your heart is more crippled than your body. Walk straight. Go ahead. Guryong, I got dust in my eye! Can't you get it out before you go? There. You're going blind, too. You don't have a lot of time to live. Have a good life with Gannan. There's no reason why a cripple can't live as well as others. Go. Guryong! I am scared! It's cold! I am scared of dying alone on a mountain peak! I want to live. It seems like only yesterday when I was six and in my mother's arms! Guryong! I want to live! You only live once! The life my mother gave me, I want it to go on for a hundred, two hundred years! What did I just say? First the eyes, then the ears, and now my head. I must be going mad. I must pray. I must pray to the Divine Spirit for rain. Go! The Divine Spirit is coming. You ungrateful child, go! Don't look back! Gu... Gu... Uncle, the back rack. It's okay. Let's go. Get the back rack. I know the way now, so I can take you up here when you're old. Mother, Geon says I should get the back rack. He's going to abandon me here when I'm old. You shouldn't come here. You'll end up resenting your child for deserting you. Mother! Go! A mother can't say her last prayer properly with her son lingering before her eyes. Mother. What now? Let me get the dust out of your eye again. You got it just now. Didn't you say you were cold? Take my coat. Here. How can a mother's heart warm up wearing her son's coat? The Divine Spirit won't even look at a mother. Who's wearing her son's coat. He'll say she's rotten. Here. Take it with you. Guryong. If I see the Divine Spirit later, I'll ask about your foot I'll ask him to fix your foot. Grandma... Uncle. Uncle. Grandma. Just a little more, uncle. I should rot in hell. If you fall, I fall too! Divine Spirit! Send us rain! Let the good and bad all prosper! Let it rain! Let it rain! Rain! Grandma made it rain! You're right! Rain! Mother! Rain! Rain! Rain! Don't leave. When Guryong returns, you will all die. The Divine Spirit is on his side. We're the ones who let Guryong go. He just got lucky. - You will die! - Shut up! He can't pay for adultery with rain. You will die. We will fight. Hang Gannan! Okay! You will die. - Uncle. - Oh, no. The ten brothers killed her. Damn Give me your axe. I'll put a spell on it. You will win. The Divine Spirit will avenge her death. Quickly, go! You swine, have you come to die? You are the ones who'll die. You'll die stricken with fear like a bird in front of a snake. You can't take nine of us! The shaman has spoken! You will die at my bare fists, and you will harm no one with your swords! Lies! For the past thirty years, you've been living in fear that I would kill you, and I have been plotting my revenge! Well, here's my chance. Don't kill any more people! We're not bad people! We're not bad people! It's your fate! The shaman said things will not come to an end. Until I kill you all! It was the shaman's idea! It's the shaman who has turned us into enemies! The shaman said things will not come to an end until I kill you all! No, No, No. We're brothers! We used to live under the same roof! - My leg... - The shaman... - Mother? - The shaman... - The mute? - The shaman... - Gannan? - The shaman... You destroyed everything that belonged to me! No, we must call each other brothers! Brother! Brother! Brother! Did you take care of them all? My divination is never wrong. There are two things this village must get rid of. One is the shaman, and the other is the Ancient Tree. What? The gods will strike you! Silence! You've killed too many at this rotting old tree! This tree has been guarding the village! It killed its own people! The tree kept evil out! It kept some small evils out and let the big ones in! Aren't you afraid of the Divine Spirit? The Divine Spirit watches and does nothing! When this tree comes down, the Divine Spirit will also die. Die! Die! Die! Die! Who will call Yeon's Saetaenim? We don't have to call her. Yeon's spirit will go free now. How will we live? Let's go plant seeds. If there's someone to teach us, we can learn to grow anything. We can live off the things we grow. Let's go.
