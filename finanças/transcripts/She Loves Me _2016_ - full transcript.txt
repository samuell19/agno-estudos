[Music] [Horn] Good morning Good day. How are you this beautiful day? Isn't this a beautiful morning? Very. Hey Sipos, how's this? That's an awfully elegant post but is all that elegance necessary? Then why not? I represent Maraczek's don't I. We're not a butcher shop or a hardware store, we are perfumery and that means we're, we're ... We're stylish. That's it. With a quiet dignity. Yes, and we get the tilt of our hats right. That's right. When I ride my bike, people see what Maraczek is like so I think it's very important that I look my best. And how many people did you run over today? Not one. Well, it's early. Here comes Ms. Ritter. Ow. She spent the night with Mr. Kodaly. Again. They always kiss goodbye at the new stand then she walks around the block to make us think she's been home. Good morning. Good day. How are you this glorious day? Have you seen a lovelier morning? Never. Ah, it's too nice a day to be inside shuffling soaked. I have no more energy whatsoever. Anybody mind if I take the day-off? Arpad, why aren't you old enough to take me away from all this? I'm old enough. Well, then marry me and I'll quit my job. No, I'm afraid you're not really quite old enough. It won't be long though. I'm catching up. You know, Mr. Nowack always used to say I get to be 35 before you ever did. Ah, Mr. Kodaly. Good morning. Good day. How are you this radiant day? What a rare magnificent for morning. Is it? Good morning my dear. How are you this ravishing day? Do you know you've never looked more exquisite? Thank you, kind sir. What a lovely dress. The same one she had on yesterday Mr. Kodaly. Well, if it isn't Mr. Nowack. Good morning. Good day. Isn't that a beautiful sky, what a perfect example of summer weather. It's nice a day to be indoors counting out change. What a waste of holiday weather all together. Let's all run away. Ah, wouldn't it be something if we all took off for work. Leaving Mr. Maraczek without a single clerk. Why not have a picnic. I could bring my wife's preserves. Champagne might be nice with hot hors d’oeuvres. It's nice a day (It's nice to day) To be stuck inside of store (To be stuck inside of store) We could all be getting our faces sun tanned (Sun tanned) It's so nice a day (It's so nice a day) To be dosing under a tree (To be dosing under a tree) And we'll be out of a job. If it cost that much to get sun tanned. I'll stay un-tanned. Pale but solvent. The Picnic. A picnic, oh well. [Applause] Well, Mr. Nowack, was the chicken the usual success? What? Last night, your weekly dinner with Mr. and Mrs. Maraczek? Oh right. Did you talk to Mr. Maraczek about replacing Mr. Horvath? Oh I, I mentioned it? absolutely not, after all with business the way it's been? Yes. But it's bound to pick now that Hammerschmidt's has closed. Did you ever try their hand cream? I wonder if it's any good. Good, my dear woman. My wife has been using their products for years. In fact, I've often wondered why theirs are always so much better than everyone else's. You should know Mr. Maraczek. [Laughter] Good morning Mr. Maraczek. Good morning. Good day. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Good day madam, may I help you? Good day madam, may I help you? Good day madam, may I help you? I would like to see a ... Face like yours. Cracked. But we carry ... Do you have a cream for ... Cherry red. Skin. Oh I see what you mean. You look enchanting. Dry. Lips. Glamorous as garbo. Big. Mouth. I would recommend a. Bath. Today. On sale, did you say? Put a little lipstick. On your nose. Twice. Morning and evening. And a little brush for. Combing my. Teeth. Absolutely. Wrap it up and send it. Thank you so much. Is there something else before you go? Yes ... What have I forgotten? I know there was something there else. What could it be? Something unimportant, something for my husband, really doesn't matter. Let's get back to me. I could also use a ... Bottle of ... Hair ... We have a splendid. Here's an inexpensive perfume called. Rat. I've never used one. If you want to clip your. Ear lobes. You may want to dye your. Hangnails. Dab a little on your. Husband's face. Won't he be surprised. I would like an eyebrow. Under my. Chin. There's an idea. Madam, I am filled with. Very soft. Soap. That should do it. Wrap it up and charge it. Thank you so much. Always such a pleasure seeing you. Thank you madam. Please call again, do call again, madam. Did you see that? It looks like business is picking up. Ladislav, I got another letter today. From her. It's so beautiful. I've got to read it to you. Did she enclose a snapshot this time? Did she say anything about meeting you face to face? Oh, we're going to very soon but just listen to this. Dear friend, yesterday morning I ran through the rain to the post office. I had the key in my hand, the key to box 1433 trembling. I open the door and reached inside and oh my dear friend, there you were. I took you out, held you in my hand and looked at you for a moment and I sat down gently opened you and read you. Mr. Sipos. Yes sir. Could you spare me one of your stomach pills? Oh yes sir. Of course, sir. Thank you. You know who's fault is this? No, sir. Yours. Mine? Every time you come dinner Mrs. Maraczek tries to fatten you up. She has the cook make dumplings and cream gravy and what happens? You stay slim and I get heartburn. Well, I'm very sorry sir. But Georg, it's time you were married. Haven't you had enough of living in furnished rooms of running around to cabarets and dance-halls? Mr. Maraczek, I haven't been to a dance-hall in years. Oh I know what you bachelors are like. Remember, I was once one myself and what a bachelor. Young, strong, oh I was something in days gone by with some girl who just happened to catch my eye. Slim, straight, light on my feet, shoes just skimming the ground 1-2-3, 1-2-3, follow the beat around, around, around. All night circling the floor until dawn lit up the sky, no one younger than I in days gone by. But then I met Mrs. Maraczek and every since I danced only with her. I bet you think that's incredible. No. Mrs. Maraczek is a beautiful woman. Young, strong, oh I was something in days gone by. The fact is I'm a terrible dancer. With some girl who just happened to catch my eye. Oh I can do it with my hands. Slim, straight, light on my feet. I've always have trouble with my feet. Shoes just skimming the ground. 1-2-3, 1-2-3, follow the beat around, around, around ... Miss Ritter ... Oh. Relax. And go back-2-3, back-2-3. Smile. That's it Mr. Nowack. Spin me around and go back-2-3, back-2-3. Very good Georg. That's it Georg. All night circling the floor til dawn lit up the sky, no one younger than I in days gone by. Thank you Georg. Take my advice Georg, find yourself one person to dance with. Believe me, it's not necessary to change partners every night. Mr. Maraczek ... Or even every other night, you just think it's necessary. Well, here they are. What? It's a little surprise for you. Oh what is it? It's a genuine leather box that wait, listen. [Music] Isn't that lovely? Well here, you try it. [Laughter] What else does it? What do you mean what else? It's a genuine leather musical cigarette box and only 10 and 6, how's that for a bargain? But who's going to buy it? Oh I can see you're in a difficult mood today. Let's ask some of the other people around here get their honest opinion. Mr. Si ... Mr. Kodaly. Yes sir. Will it sell? I can't imagine why not sir. I'd even go further. I think this will make music lovers out of cigarette smokers and cigarette smokers out of music lovers. Thank you Mr. Kodaly. You're welcome sir. All right Georg, I'll make you a bet. I'll bet you 10 and 6 we sell the first of these boxes within one hour. Oh I don't want to take your money sir. Oh 10 and 6, one hour no more no less, is it a bet? Well, I think that'd be very irresponsible for me to ... He's not so confident now. It's a bet. Oh you will pay through the nose, you will pay through the nose. [Bell rings] Good day madam, may I help you? I'd like a large tube of Mona Lisa. Mona Lisa Cold Cream, certainly madam. Isn't that a lovely melody? Is seven and four the largest size or is there a larger? We also have a nine and six. I'd like to see it. This is a musical cigarette box. Do you carry flowers of spring in the one ounce bottle? The one ounce bottle, certainly. Mr. Sipos, your customer. Yes sir, over here madam. Good day madam, may I help you? Who do I see about returning a jar of sour face cream? Mr. Kodaly, your customer. Right this way madam. [Applause] Good day madam, may I help you? No. Oh yes. We have a complete stock of perfumes, soaps, shampoos ... No. Bath oils, bath salts ... No. Cold creams, face creams, nail polishes. No. Brushes, hard soft and medium. No. Toilet water, we have a special this week only on "Roses of Italy." Here, I'll show it to you. Thursday, good. I'll stop by for it. Thank you very much madam. Thank you, madam. Please call again Do call again, madam. Let me spray a little on your hand. No. No? Actually you see, I'm not going to buy any. Not today, I'm not going to buy anything. Is Mr. Maraczek here? He's in the back room. Oh may I speak with him please? Perhaps I can help you? I don't think so. Well, he's quite busy. Then I'll wait. I don't mind really, I'll just sit right here quietly and wait until he's free. May I ask the nature of your business? I think I better speak with Mr. Maraczek personally. Very well, may I have your name please. Balash, Amalia Balash. Very well Ms. Balash I'll tell him you're here. Just one thing, Ms. Horvath who used to work here, the one who's having a baby, she hasn't been replaced yet, has she? Are you looking for a job? I guess you could call it that, yes. Well, I'm a very good sales girl. Really, very good and I know the perfumery business inside and out. I worked at Hammerschidt's five years, five years and eight months and they were always very satisfied with me. I have a letter here from Mr. Hammerschidt himself. It's somewhere here. It says Ms. Balash is honest, dependable, dedicated ... dedicated. It is here somewhere. She also is an abundance of those qualities which go toward making a superior salesperson. I highly recommend her signed Herman Hammerschidt. Oh here. Well, I'm sure it's just as you say but unfortunately we are not replacing Ms. Horvath right now so if you wouldn't mind leaving your name ... Balash, Amalia Balash. Right and if anything should come up ... I'd like to speak to Mr. Maraczek please. I'm afraid if it's only about a job ... Please. I'm sorry it just can't be done. What can't be done? At Maraczek's, nothing is impossible. Perhaps I can help you. She wants a job. What? I know this business inside and out. I worked at Hammerschidt's. I'm sorry. I have a letter here from Mr. Hammerschidt himself. It's out of the question. I'm honest, dependable, dedicated. Oh really Georg, can't you handle this sort of thing without calling me in? But I'm a very good sales girl. If you will excuse me. No really, I am. I'm very good. Aren't these marvelous boxes and only 10 and 6, can you imagine? What are they for? Candy. Candy? Why yes madam, it's the latest thing and just look at the workmanship. Oh ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha. A musical candy box? Why certainly madam. It combines the three elements of good taste, attractive to the eye, attractive to the ear and functional. How functional? How? Well, let me tell you. This little box has been a lifesaver to many, many women with a slight tendency to overweight and don't we all. We sit at home reading a good book or listening to a symphony and without even realizing it. Our hand slips into the candy box. We become indiscrete eating sweet after sweet though we know all too well where that may lead. So this box was designed with the two of us in mind as the kind of reminder we need. When you raise the lid, the music plays like a disapproving nod. And it sings in your ear no more candy, my dear. In a way, it's a little like the voice of God. I'll take it. Thank you, madam. If you step right over ehre pleasem that will be three and eght for the large jar of face crea, And then and six for the box, thank you madam. Thank you very much. You're hired Miss ... Balash, Amalia Balash. Miss Balash, welcome to Maraczek's and now Mr. Nowack if you please. Fourteen and four, fourteen and five, fifteen. Your packages madam. Thank you madam. Please call again . Do call again, madam. [Music] Dear friend, when a day brings petty aggravations and my poor frayed nerves are all askew, I forget these unimportant matters pouring out my hopes and dreams to you. As I rest my pen and look around me, I can see the summer disappear. Oh, dear friend all at once autumn's here. Good morning, Ms. Ritter. Good morning, Arpad. Look, autumn. Good morning, Ilona. Here you are on this first October day, the quintessence of autumn. I do hope you've forgiven me about our little misunderstanding last night. I just can't bear it when we quarrel. Can you darling truthfully? Go to hell. Dear friend, with November just around the corner, I've a feeling you may also share. Do you feel an undertone of discord and a sense of tension in the air? Mr. Nowack, must this sidewalk always be covered with leaves? No sir but Mr. Maraczek, Mr. Maraczek. If it weren't for your endearing letters, I'd be flying south with all the geese. By the way, have you read "War and Peace?" Good morning Mr. Nowack. I see you're on time today Miss Balash, congratulations. So sorry to disappoint you. But I'm not disappointed, far from it. Let's just call it surprised. They always argue, why is that? Simple chemical reaction, you see sometimes when two people like each other very much ... They like each other? I think so. They like each other very much? Well, don't you think we should tell them? Arpad my boy, they'd never believe us. Look, winter. Dear friend, have you set your calendar for Tuesday when we bring this ... Georg and Amalia: Chapter to a close, when I meet my lady of the letters who puts tiny faces in her "O's." In the freezing weather of December I'll be warmly waiting for our date. Until then, count the hours oh I'm late for work. I'm late. Good morning. Good morning. Am I very late? No. Did Mr. Nowack say anything? No. Where is he? In the work room. No. You're all new, the shoes, the dress, the hat. It's top to bottom. I'm surprised you recognized me. Do I look all right? Lovely wonderful, very nice. Very nice. Yes, yes, yes. It took me three hours to get dressed. That's why I'm so late. I have a feeling our little Miss Balash must be in love and you have a rendezvous with him this evening. How do you know? Mr. Kodaly is an expert on love which is really quite remarkable considering he's never been in it. Good morning Miss Balash. He didn't yell at me. What's wrong with him? He has other things on his mind. Mr. Maraczek is very upset. He is? Again? And you know who gets the worst of it. Mr. Nowack. Yes sir. You see this? Yes. You know what it is? Of course. It's a tube of Mona Lisa Cold Cream. Here, let's see you try it. It came out the back. I was under the impression it was your responsibility to see that these tubes are correctly filled. If that responsibility is too much for you Mr. Nowack or is there something wrong with the tubes, are they defective? No, no. I don't think so. You don't think so then it wouldn't be asking too much for the cream to come out the right end? No, it would not be asking too much. Thank you Mr. Nowack. That's all I wanted to know. Georg, Georg. Your coat, there's still Mona Lisa on it. Thank you, thank you Ladislav. You're so nervous. I can feel you vibrating. Well, it's a, it's a, it's a new suit. I've never worn it to work before. Oh? What's the occasion? The biggest ever, I'm meeting her, tonight. The letter girl, you mean face to face at last. Face to face at last. Well, I just hope she lives up to your expectations. Can I tell you something Ladislav? I hope she doesn't. I mean, I, I hope she's not as beautiful as I think she is or, or as brilliant as I think she is because then, what will she think of me? A very ordinary clerk in a very ordinary shop and a terrible liar. A liar? The things I wrote in those letters. You lied? Ehhh. No wonder you're vibrating. I'm nervous and upset because this girl I've never met. I get to meet tonight at eight. I'm taking her to dinner at a charming old café but who can eat tonight at eight? It's early in the morning and our date is not til eight o'clock tonight and yet already I can see what a nightmare this whole day will be. I haven't slept a wink. I only think of our approaching tete-a-tete tonight at eight. I feel a combination of depression and elation, what a state to wait til eight. Three more minutes, two more seconds, 10 more hours to go. In spite of all I've written she may not be very smitten and my hopes perhaps may all collapse kaput tonight at eight. I wish I knew exactly how I'll act and what will happen when we dine tonight at eight. I know I'll drop the silverware but will I spill the water or the wine tonight at eight? Tonight I'll walk right up and sit right down beside the smartest girl in town and then it's anybody's guess. More and more I'm breathing less and less. In my imagination I can hear our conversation taking shape tonight at eight. I'll sit there saying absolutely nothing or I'll jabber like an ape tonight at eight. Two more minutes, three more seconds, 10 more hours to go. I'll know when this is don't if something's ended or begun and if it goes all right. Who knows I might propose tonight at eight. This is fun. I love Christmas wrapping. It certainly is a pleasant change. You know for the past month I've don't practically nothing but fill those darn tubes of Mona Lisa. Well, what do you care? You're in love with a nice eligible young man. Pretty soon, you'll be able to kiss all this goodbye. Tell me, what's he like? Tell me all about him. I love to suffer. Well ... Is he tall? So, so. So, so six feet, so, so five feet? I never measured. Color of hair, color of eyes. Sandy hair, not really light not really dark. And the eyes? Bluish greenish. Brownish? A little. Is he handsome? You know, it's funny at times he is and then again at times he's not. Well built. Average. You want a piece of good advice, don't lose him in a crowd. Why? Why am I such an unconvincing liar? The fact is I've never met him ever really. Never? That's why I don't know if he's tall, wide, short, narrow, pink, green or even what his name is. You mean all this fuss is just for a blind date. My God, you're even more desperate than I am. It's not a blind date. I know him. How? Letters, many, many letters. You belong to a lonely hearts club? I have never done that sort of thing before. I had seen the advertisements in the papers. Well, who has it? Young man wants young lady, young lady wants young man. But I've never taken them seriously until one day I saw his advertisement. Even then I tried not to answer it really but he just kept calling out to me. He could be 75. No. The advertisement says young man. You haven't even asked for a photograph. I don't know his name or what he looks like. But I have a much more certain guide. I can tell exactly what he looks like inside. When I undertook his correspondence, little did I know I'd grow so fond. Little did I know our views would so correspond. He writes me what his feelings are on shaw, Flaubert, chopin, Renoir. The more I read the more I find we're one in mind and heart. I know the kind of home we'd share, the books, the prints, the music there a home, a life that's warm and full and rich in love and art. I don't need to see his handsome profile. I don't need to see his manly frame. All I need to know is in each letter each long revealing letter I couldn't know him better if I knew his name. I know him so well Ilona. I know that he's a very successful person and terribly well-educated and he's gentle and kind and soft spoken. I know all this about him and so much more. I've just never met him. That's all. He writes his deepest vemeer and Debussy ... If he isn't too handsome, thoughts to me on swift, true, it doesn't much matter but his personal habits are more important than his looks. Supposing he snores like a locomotive? Supposing he grinds his teeth? Supposing he's a knucklecracker, Amalia? Good luck with your books. And another small detail that you haven't yet mentioned. I am speaking of sex, dear when you and he are all alone come to think of it maybe you're right. Maybe it doesn't matter at that. Maybe it doesn't matter at that. Maybe I'd do much better myself with a library card and Maybe I'd do much better myself with a library card and a gramophone. I don't need to see his handsome profile. I don't need to see his handsome profile. I was taken in by someone's profile. I was taken in by someone's profile. I don't need to see his manly frame. I was taken in by someone's frame. All I need to know is in each letter each ... How could I have used one ... Long, revealing letter. I couldn't love him better. I hope you do much better. If I knew his name. I knew his name. What's in a name? [Music] Mr. Nowack, perhaps you can help me? Yes, sir? I'm looking for the Christmas decorations. I don't see them. Well, we haven't, we haven't started them yet. I was going to talk to you about it in a day or two. I am sick and tired of you running to me like a baby on every little matter that comes up. Mr. Maraczek, that's not fair. Excuse me Georg, kindly inform all the employees, they'll have to stay late tonight. Now, is it clear even to you? It's perfectly clean but I'm afraid I can't stay. I have an appointment. Excuse me. I can stay tomorrow night, Thursday night Friday? That won't be necessary. I assure you we'll get on splendidly without you. Thank you, that's all. That's not all Mr. Maraczek, for the past month I can't seem to do anything right. Everything has changed, what is it? Is it you? Is it me? If my, if my work is bad now, it's been bad for the last 15 years, why the hell did you wait until now to start telling me? How dare you raise your voice in this shop? Clumsy idiot. You did that on purpose didn't you? I had to stop that argument before you did something foolish like resigning. Well, I'm not so sure I appreciate that. I didn't do it for you Georg, I did it for me. Who knows? If you resign you're successor might take one look at me and ask himself, "What's that oaf doing in this fancy parfumerie?" You are a very good clerk Ladislav. I'm an idiot. But at least I'm an idiot with a job. Call me fool. That's all right with me. Here's my rule, never disagree. Where's my pride? Swallowed long ago deep inside where it doesn't show. Bowing, scrapping, nodding, beaming, always humble, not ounce of self-repect. Yes sir, yes sir. You're so right, sir. Black is white, sir. Excuse me while I genuflect. How do I remain so calm and cheerful? How do I retain my peace of mind let me just explain my rationale. It's all in your perspective. Listen, listen to an old Hungarian's philosophy. I am only one of several in a rather small parfumaerie which is only one of several in this city, which is one of many cities in this country, which is only one of many countries, which are on this continent, which is only one of seven on this not so special planet, which is one of many in our solar system, which is only one of many solar systems in this vast and inconceivable affair that is the universe. So in this infinite, incomprehensible scheme, if a dot called Maraczek should scream at a speck called Sipos, what on earth does it matter? So call me fool, that's all right with me. Here's my rule, never disagree. Where's my pride? Swallowed long ago deep inside where it doesn't show. Just maintain true perspective and it's easy to avoid a clash of wills. Just maintain true perspective and make sure you're well supplied with stomach pills. Let me put it bluntly, I'm a coward with a wife and children to support. Actually my creed is short and simple. Five essential words Georg, do not lose your job. Miss Ritter, Miss Ritter. What? This is going to be a charge. Here's the lady's name. Just a name after such a long conversation, no telephone number? I don't need it. She's got mine. Now that I have you all here, Miss Balash, Mr. Maraczek wants everyone to stay late tonight. Why? To work on Christmas decorations, all right? I guess so. Of course. Good day, madam. May I help you? Mr. Nowack, Mr. Nowack I can't stay. Why? I have a date. You know I have a date. I don't know such thing. How can you say that? Why do you think I'm wearing these new clothes? To trim a tree in? I'm only following Mr. Maraczek's instructions. I can't stay. You are not being very cooperative Miss Balash. Well, why did he have to pick this one night or did you pick it Mr. Nowack because you knew I had an appointment? Thank you madam, please call again, do call again madam. You know, I find it quite depressing that anyone could hate me so much. I do not hate you Miss Balash. But until you came here this was a happy peaceful place. Now, the whole atmosphere has changed, everyone is cranky, Mr. Maraczek is on the warpath. That's not my fault. The Mona Lisa is coming out the wrong end of the tubes. And that's not my fault, is it? You've been filling them. According to your instructions. What? Can we not fight about this? Can we have a truce? Anytime Mr. Nowack. After all, you're always the one who starts things. I'm the one. You have always resented me from the first day I came here when I made you lose that bet to Mr. Maraczek for ten-and-six, wasn't it? To think that anyone could hate me so much just for ten-and-six. That is nonsense. Or was it your male pride that got wounded because I went over your head, men always do seem to resent things like that. I do not resent you Miss Balash. Yes, you do. Oh, for heaven's sake I do not resent you. But if I did, I would have very good reason. Can you deny you had not worked here two weeks before you started making very public, very humiliating remarks about me? Only because you've been going around calling me Miss A-mal-ia Balash/ Miss A-malia Balash, do you think I like that? Do you think I liked you criticizing my socks, my ties, my fingernails? Much better. That must be the rudest, most difficult, worst-tempered girl in the world. Good day, madam. May I help you? Yes. I'd like to see lily scented soap. Well, Mr. Nowack, hard at work as usual, I see. Good day ladies. May I help you? Have you made the arrangements about tonight? Yes sir. Ms. Ritter and Mr. Kodaly and Mr. Sipos can all stay and Arpad of course. What about Miss Balash? She has an appointment. Well, I guess you could hardly prevail upon her to stay when you're not going to. Any other night Mr. Maraczek. There seem to be a great many things Mr. Nowack that interest you far more than your position here. Mr. Maraczek, I am devoted to this shop. I could not work harder if I owned it. If you owned it. Let me tell you something my young friend. No matter what you do, you will never get your hands on this shop, never. Not if I have to come down from heaven and stop you myself. Is it clear? Yes, perfectly clear. Now, get away from me, just get away from me. Oh I will get away and permanently. Can I take that as your resignation Mr. Nowack? That is exactly what it is. Very well, I accept it effective immediately. Miss Ritter will have your final pay. Excuse me, is this the large size or the medium size? Ah, the large size. Well then, show me the medium and I haven't got all day. Yes, madam. I would like a cake of castile soap and a powder puff, shampoo. Is there a sale on? Let me have a hairnet, bubble bath. How much do you charge for your Mona Lisa? Mr. Nowack, are you leaving? Well, it should be good news for you Miss Balash, very good news. I won't be arguing with you anymore. I've just quit my job. Why? Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't have much choice. I don't know what to say. Then don't say anything especially not that you're sorry. Let's not end our relationship on that false note, goodbye Miss Balash. Mr. Nowack, may the condemned woman have one last word? I never wished you harm ever, you've got to believe that. I believe you Miss Balash and may I say I sincerely hope you marry a very nice man and have many children. And for the sake of my successor in this job, I hope it's soon. ... old cream, do you have a lotion good for soothing sensitive skin? Good bye, Georg. How much do you charge your Mona Lisa? Maraczek's won't be the same without you. Can you recommend an unusual perfume? Sorry to see you go. Something rather chic but inexpensive. If I can ever help. That will make a novel Christmas gift. Let me know. I'm fine that I'm after. Do you have a lipstick, guaranteed kiss-proof? Coconut oil? What kind of mascara? Good bye, Georg. Let me have a jar of vanishing cream and a bottle of your I wish there were time for a proper farewell. Wrap it as a gift and send it? Put it on ... But for now good luck and good bye, Georg. So long, so long. Please keep in touch. Do keep in touch, won't you? Will he like me when we meet? Will the shy and quiet girl he's going to see be the girl that he's imagined me to be? Will he like me? Will he like the girl he sees? If he doesn't, will he know enough to know that there's more to me than I may always show? Will he like me? Will he know that there's a world of love waiting to warm him? Ho I'm hoping that his eyes and ears won't misinform him. Will he like me? Who can say? How I wish that we could meet another day. It's absurd for me to carry on this way. I'll try not to. Will he like me? He's just got to. When I am in my room alone and I write, thoughts come easily. Words come fluently then. That's how it is when I'm alone but tonight there's no hiding behind my paper and pen. Will he know that there's a world of love waiting to warm him? How I'm hoping that his eyes and ears won't misinform him. Will he like me? I don't know. All I know is that I'm tempted not to go. It's insanity for me to worry so. I'll try not to. Will he like me? He's just got to. Will he like me? Will he like me? [Applause] Maraczek's, may I help you? Oh yes, one moment please. Mr. Maraczek, it's for you. I'll take it in my office. Ladislav, have you got a pack of icicles over there? I don't see any. Would you please ask Mr. Kodaly if he's got them? Miss Ritter would like to know if you've got her icicles. Icicles? Please tell her that it's all I've been getting from her for several weeks. He says that's ... I heard him. Why else would I be laughing so uncontrollably? Sipos, what do you think of a woman who goes with a man, tells him she loves him and then suddenly drops him? Before you answer that Ladislav, what do you think about a man who cancels three dates with a girl in a little over a week? A little over a week? Eight days. I don't recall three dates. You don't recall anything, you never did. You are so wrong, Ilona. I recall our evenings together. I recall them very well. Our private little booth at the Rathskeller. Remember? Oh, come on, Ilona. Let's go there tonight. You always loved the Rathskeller, the Chinese food, the, the gypsy fortune teller and that rhumba band? Ilona? Come with me, Ilona. I've missed you so much. How I eny you each evening when work is through for I have only me to be with while you have you. No. Without you, Ilona. How cold my lonely life has grown. Are you happy alone, Ilona? Ilona, my own. Now that Kodaly is hard at play, we'll never get out of here until new Years day so ... Happy New Year. Come with me, Ilona. Come with me, Cherie. Mistletoe, I long for someone. Please tell me who. Like some divine divining rod, it points straight to you. Remember, Ilona those sunny nights we knew before? If you'll just say the word, Ilona we'll know them once more. If it was only up to me, guess who I would hang upon the Christmas tree. Ths is where I came in, amen. The fox and the chicken are a team again. Oh no, ah. Yes. Ah. Together, Ilona we generate a spark that's rare. Why deny that it's there, Ilona? You feel it, I know. Let's help it to glow. You really are a rat. All right, we'll go to the Rathskeller together but you better have plenty of money because I'm starve or is it going to be Dutch as usual? No, no. No, no, no, no. My treat. You can all go home now, go home. But the work isn't finished yet sir. We'll have to do it some other time. Oh speaking for myself Mr. Maraczek, I wouldn't mind staying a little longer. You see, I'm in the rhythm of it now. No. I want everyone out as quickly as possible. Yes sir. Good night. Good night Mr. Maraczek. It's only 9:30. 9:30, Arpad. What? Good news. Why? You've been reprieved. Mr. Maraczek says we can go. You're all ready, I'll just get my things. Arpad, can you get them for me? Ilona, this is going to be a bit difficult to explain but I'm afraid I won't be able to take to the Rathskeller after all. What? I can't help myself. Darling, the fact is I thought we were going to be working late tonight so I canceled the previous appointment but now they were finished early I've just got to keep it. You do understand, don't you darling? Trust me, I promise you we'll go to the Rathskeller another night soon. Let's see, tonight is Tuesday. What about next Monday? Ilona, Cherie. I resolve not to be so stupid. Will you keep Monday night open for me darling? I resolve not to play these games. All right sweetheart. How often I've been a sitting duck for cupid. How often I've let him shoot me down in flames. Sweetheart, say it's all right? I resolve not to be so trusting. It's high time, time that I awoke. Whatever I've got up here is up here rusting. My feminine intuition is a joke. I must be cousin to a cat. I always wind up with a rat. I'm through with momentary thrills. I find it can't afford the bills. I resolve come what may. I will not be this girl one more day. I resolve not to be so brainless. I resolve not to be so dumb. My usual brush with love is far from painless. And suddenly I have got to know how come. I resolve not to blame the others just because I'm an easy mark. I want to know why I never meet their mothers. Where men are concerned I'm always in the dark. I must stop thinking with my skin. I will not be a mandolin that someone strums and puts away until he gets the urge to play. I resolve here and now. I will be a different girl somehow. Ladislav. Georg. I have to talk to you. Will you come with me to the Café Imperiale? It's urgent. The Café Imperiale? She will be sitting there all alone. Your lady friend? The one who writes the letters? Yes, yes, yes, yes and on the table in front of her will be a copy of Anna Karenina with a rose in it and I would have a rose here. Oh that's a very romantic picture Georg, very romantic except for one thing? One thing? What am I doing there? I need you to give her this letter which explains I've been called out of town on urgent business but I will write to her as soon as possible. She won't be disappointed? She would be more disappointed if she saw me the way that I am tonight. Will you give her this for me? Well, of course I will but ... Please, please we must hurry. For all I know she got tired of waiting and left long ago. [Knocking] Mr. Keller. Mr. Maraczek. Come in, please. Do we talk here? Everyone is gone. Well, as I told you on the phone sir, we completed our investigation. Yes? Who sent this to me? I'm afraid we don't know that. Anonymous letters are difficult to track down but we have checked its contents. As you see we've been following Mrs. Maraczek and there's no doubt she's involved with one of your clerks just as the letters say. There's no doubt. I'm sorry sir. You know, I've known all along, I just had to be sure. She's been going to his apartment, number 17 Court Street. Each visit is listed. Would you care to have us do an investigation of Mr. Kodaly? Who? Well, that's his name Steven Kodaly. No. Steven Kodaly, Number 17 Court Street ... Kodaly. It's just that he hardly knows Mrs. Maraczek and there's another clerk here, a clerk who has been to our house many times. I thought, naturally I thought ... If you'll read the report, sir. Yes, thank you. Will there be anything else? I'll be saying good night. Good night, Mr. Keller. Good night, sir. [Phone Ringing] Maraczek, here. Hello, love. Yes, I know. You'll be out late then? I see. Give her my best. No, I just feel a little tired. Of course, of course. No, I won't wait up. So do I, bye-bye. Mr. Maraczek, don't, don't Mr. Maraczek. [Gunshot] [Applause] Butterfingers, do that again, that's the end of your career. How do you do sir? How do you do madam? Don't you know we try to preserve a romantic atmosphere? God to see you again, Mr. Liszt. That's what all our patrons expect so every jarring note will be ruthlessly checked. Gently does it try to preserve a romantic atmosphere. Think of all the love affairs we assist. What more noble calling is there than ours. Tending each new beautiful bud of love making sure each delicate seedling flowers. Treat each tryst and rendezvous as your own, bearing in mind the gravity of your task. All these lovers wanted one shining hours. Is that such a terrible lot to ask? Shhh... Look around and see for yourself the romantic atmosphere. Viktor ... Stefsnie. That's what all our patrons demand, that's the reason why they're here. Viktor ... Hugo. They all come here just for the mood and if you don't believe me try tasting our food. That's why we have got to preserve a romantic atmosphere. Miss, I don't think this is the proper way to tango. [Dance number culminating in rowdy behavior] Congo. Where's Viktor? Here's viktor. Such behavior won't be allowed but every now and then we just get the wrong crowd. Gently does it try to preserve a romantic atmosphere. [Applause] Where's the rose? Huh? The rose, where is it? Ow. That's the rose? It's been in my pocket all day. Let me have it. No, no, no, no. You've gone this far. Go the rest of the way. No, no, no. Just give her the letter please and thank you Ladislav, I really appreciate it. Wait. At least take a look at her. You look. No. Ah ... She's old? She's old and ugly and toothless, isn't she? I wouldn't say so. Well, there must be something wrong with her, terribly wrong. Why? I can see it in your face. No, no, the fact is she's very attractive girl. She really is? Absolutely. But will I think so? Well ... of course that's a matter of personal taste. Let's see, who does she look like? Oh some film star. No, no, no. Let me think. More than anyone else, I'd say she looks like someone in the shop. In our shop? As a matter of fact, you know who? Miss Balash. She looks very much like her. Miss Ba ... Miss A-malia Balash, but I thought you said attractive? Well, I think so but if you don't care for Miss Balash, you're certainly not going to like this girl. They're that similar? See for yourself. You're just going to leave her there? What do you suggest, huh? What? You want me to tell her I'm the poor fool who's written all those letters? She would make me the laughingstock of the entire city? How? She wrote some too. Dear friend, I took you out of the box, I cut you open and so on. It's impossible. What? She did write those letters. She couldn't have. So you think it's just a coincidence. She just happens to like this café. She just happens to be reading Anna Karenina. She just happens to be using a rose a bookmark in December. But it's Miss Balash, I can't be in love with Miss Balash. How do you know until you try? I know her. There's some mistake Ladislav, there's got to be. Well then, talk to her. Find out. No, no. She's not different, she's not, she can't be. Can she? Miss Balash. Mr. Nowack, what are you doing here? Celebrating, how about you? I'm waiting for someone. Anyone in particular? Yes, of course. What kind of a girl do you think I am? Oh never mind Mr. Nowack, I know. May I sit down for a minute. No, no I'm afraid not. You won't help me celebrate? Celebrate? My freedom Miss Balash, just think of it. Tomorrow is Wednesday and I can sleep in as late as I llike. No Mr. Nowack, I told you that chair happens to be reserved. You won't have just one quick drink with me? No I can't. One small farewell drink? It's very small and very quick. Thank you Miss Balash. All right, all right. Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Well, here's to Maraczek Parfumerie and all the people who work there and all the people who used to work there and all the customers ... And that covers everything. Good wine. Mr. Nowack, are you spying on me? Spying? Did you come here to make sure I really had a date and that I wasn't just inventing an excuse not to work tonight? Miss Balash, who would I be spying for, Maraczek? Mr. Nowack, if you do not leave this table immediately I'm going to have to call for the waiter. Yes, madam. There you are. May I put a word in, just one word. The Café Imperiale is a rendezvous for lovers. Look around you. We try to preserve a romantic atmosphere and I find it very difficult madam when you and your husband insists on fighting right in the middle it. Can't you argue at home? No. No, this is not my husband. This is a business associate. Well, talk business someplace else. You, you say you're meeting someone here, someone you've known very long. Mr. Nowack, will, you leave? It just doesn't seem right for a man to keep a girl waiting all alone in such a public place. Will you please leave? Even if he is an old friend. A dear friend. I don't wish to discuss this with you Mr. Nowack. What is the name of that tune? My mother used to sing it when I was a baby. So did mine. Miss Balash, do you realized we've just found something in common? At one time were both infants. Yes, but I grew up. I believe it's called "Tango Tragique." What if he's already been here and seen us together and gone? I will never forgive you. What is this? No, put that back. Anna Karenina. Yes, it's a book. By Leo Tolstoy. A Russian. Will you put it back please? And what's this for? No, that's none of your business. Miss Balash, could it be that you've never even met this man. That's ridiculous. Of course it is. And yet, you know, some girls and some men do make appointments with strangers and sometimes it turns out rather well. And on the other hand sometimes it turns out not so well. I remember a girl I used to know. She was writing to someone through Lonely Hearts Club. They corresponded for sometime then decided to meet up. I seem to recall she was to have a flower in her book and he was to have that same flower in his lapel and they didn't recognized each other I guess. The next day the police found her left leg floating in the Danube. And, you know, they never did find the rest of her or her book. At the count of five, I'll scream so you'd better go and soon. One. I just want to talk to you. Don't forget I've had some wine and nothing to eat since noon. Two. Miss Balash, are you intoxicated? Dante oncedescribed all the depths of hell. If I have my way, you will know them well. Three. Miss Balash. You are easily the most insensitive man alive. I'm surprised with you. I'm sorry but I'm fighting for my life. Four, four and a half, will you go? Then five. Are you trying to ruin me, lady? I warned you get out. That's all, get out. Wait a minute. You too, get out. Look, you don't understand. Screaming like lunatics, that's all get out. How dare you speak to aa lady that way? Ladies don't scream in cafés. Well, I'm afraid you don't quite understand. You see, there was a fly in the wine. What? I said a fly in the wine. Where is it? Show it to me. I'm afraid that's quite impossible. You see, the lady here swallowed it. She swallowed? Wouldn't you scream? Good God. Really. Mr. Nowack, no matter how much you might despise me or how unhappy you are, haven't you had enough revenge? I don't understand you. How could you Miss Balash? You have never listened to me. You have never really looked at me. How wrong you are Mr. Nowack. I'm looking at you now. Shall I tell you what I see? A smog pompous petty tyrant, very sure of himself and very ambitious but I see him ten years from now selling shampoo. And twenty years from now selling shampoo and thirty years from now still selling shampoo because basically do you know what he is? Just a not very smart, not very handsome, not very young man with balding hair and the personality of a python. Mr. Nowack, I didn't mean all those things. Mr. Nowach. Don't call him, he'll come back. It's almost closing time. Closing time, no. I'm still waiting for someone. He'll have a rose in his lapel. To match the one in your book? How late is her? Over two hours. You're a very patient young lady. I have waited for him all my life. What's two hours? This one is on the house for luck. Thank you. You know, this is a very nice café. We try to preserve a romantic atmosphere. The flowers, the linen, the crystal I see were carefully chosen for people like me. The silver agleam and the candles aglow, your favorite songs on request. Each colorful touch in the finest of taste and to notice how subtly the tables are spaced. The music is muted, the lighting is low, no wonder I feel so depressed. Charming, romantic, the perfect café then as if it isn't bad enough a violin starts to play. Candles and wine, tables for two but where are you, dear friend? Couples go past me. I see how they look so discretely sympathetic when they see the rose and the book. I make believe nothing is wrong. How long can I pretend? Please make it right. Don't break my heart. Don't let it end, dear friend. We're closing up. So soon? It looks like your friend didn't get here. I'm sure there's a very good reason. Then he'll write to you and you can patch it up and I hope you'll be very happy. Thank you. Will you tell me something? You've seen so many of these cases. Does it ever happen that the girl is here and the young man arrives and looks at her secretly and just goes away without explaining or writing? Does that ever happen? Sometimes. And sometimes she looks at him and she goes away. How heart-breaking that must be. Well, you don't have to worry. You're a nice presentable girl. Not a beauty contest winner ... but you should see some of the others. I make believe nothing is wrong. How long can I pretend? Please make it right. Don't break my heart. Don't let it end, dear friend. [Applause] [Music] Come in. I'm back. Good. You can take this away. Thank you. Well, I did everything you told me to. You went to the shop? Here's the key. What did you tell them about last night? That you shot yourself accidentally, you were cleaning your gun. Good. And I delivered your message to Mr. Nowack, Well, that is I left it with his landlady, he was out. Very good. There's something else. Miss Balash is sick. Her mother called that she won't be in today and that's everything. Arpad, you're a credit to your profession. Thank you Mr. Maraczek. You know, I'm not afraid of responsibility. I welcome it. In fact, I'd welcome a lot more. I'll keep it in mind. And I can't help thinking Christmas is almost here. All that Christmas shopping, we're going to be very shorthanded in the shop. We'll have to manage. But one more clerk would certainly come in handy. What is it? You know someone who wants a job? Mr. Maraczek, you've got to stop thinking of me as just a delivery boy in a suit with a tie, I look old and I've been training myself to be a salesclerk, training hard for two years. You've been training? I have trained myself going shelf by shelf and I know every item in the store. And every tube, jar, box bottle carton and container, where they are, what they cost, what they're for. Although it's something you have never thought about, Mr. Maraczek, try me. You need a man who knows the business inside out, Mr. Maraczek, try me. You need help or I'd have never spoken and why bring someone in when I'm already broken. In this emergency I wouldn't let you down Mr. Maraczek, try me. Oh I can see by the uncertain way you frown that you've asked yourself why me? For first class clerking and consciencious working, Mr. Maraczek, why not try me? All right, this cream is sour, very sour take it back. You wish to return this jar madam, certainly right you are madam. You say it smells like a drowneded cat? It does at that. At Maraczek's mada, we claim with pride. The customer must be satisfied. The customer must be satisfied. By the way we have a special sale on Autumn Heather. Let me spray some on your hand. Here, we'll smell it together. It has the three elements of good perfume attractive to the nose, invisible to the eye and functional. My wife has used it time and again. It's very appealing to us men. I use it myself every now and then. I'll take it. Certainly madam. Oh Miss Ritter, Miss Ritter, that's 20 and six for the Autumn Heather, eight-and-three for the cream, 32 even for that bottle of Mermaid's Dream, one and three for the eyebrow pencil, nine for the large shampoo and then for the jar you're bringing back, that's four and two for you. That's a total of 98 kess four and two for the jar. Out of a hundred ... here's your change, five and two, there you are. The biggest sale in several years, I believe. Thank you madam, please call again. Glad I could help. Here is my card. Thank you madam please call again, do call again madam. I would gladly grow a moustache if you'd like Mr. Maraczek, try me. I would even think of giving up my bike Mr. Mraczek, try me. For first class clerking and conscientious working, Mr. Maraczek, why not try me. Very impressive. You even managed to short change me. Mr. Maraczek. Georg. What happened? He shot himself accidentally, he was cleaning his gone. Arpad, will you please leave us alone. Are you in very much pain, Mr. Maraczek? The only place that doesn't hurt me is my shoulder where I shot myself? Is, is there anything I can do? First, I have to do something. Something very important, if I could stand up, you know what I'd do? I'd walk over and take you by the hand and beg you to forgive me. I forgive you Mr. Maraczek, whatever happened, why ever it happened I don't care? You can't let me off that easily, I did a terrible thing to you and there's no excuse. Well, there's one excuse. That jealousy of an old man. Jealousy? Oh Georg, you're still in the dark. I guess you're the only man in the world who ever had an affair without knowing it. An affair? You've been having an affair with my wife. With your wife, with Mrs. Maraczek? Yes, I have all the facts. No, no, no but it's not true. I know it's not true. I know now but last week and two weeks ago I didn't know. I don't believe it, Mrs. Maraczek and I, did y ou really think that I would do that ... That's just the point, I didn't think. I can't get over it. But Georg, starting today if you're willing, I'd like you to take over the shop. Of course I will and at least keep the doors open until you're well enough to come back. There is the key and now that you're the boss if you wanted to give yourself a raise ... Well, I'll have a little talk with myself. And if I don't ask for too much, I may grant it. The perfect executive, now you better get going. You'll be very shorthanded today. Arpad tells me Miss Balash isn't coming in. Miss Balash, why not? She's sick. What's wrong with her? He didn't say but you have to manage without her and without one other clerk as well, Mr. Kodaly, I want you to fire him. Fire him? Just give him two weeks salary. I didn't realize Mr. Kodaly was so unsatisfactory. He works very hard. But at the wrong things. I'm not sure I understand. Well, if you ever run into Mrs. Maraczek, perhaps she'll explain it to you and Georg, it looks like I'm a bachelor again same as you. Perhaps one night you'll take me to a cabaret. But I don't go to that.I know you never go to cabarets. I'll stop by later and I'll give you a full report. Thank you my boy. I'll be here. [Applause] Arpad. Have you been thinking about me as a salesclerk? Quite seriously but you're so attached to your bicycle, how could you ever part with it? Well, what if I didn't part with it? All together, I could be half delivery boy half clerk. Arpad, you just made a sale. I did? As of right now. Thank you Mr. Maraczek, thank you. And I guess we can't call you Arpad anymore, I don't think I ever knew your last name. You do have a last name? Laszlo. Welcome to Maraczek's Mr. Laszlo. Mr. Laszlo. You better get going. I'm on my way and you can count on me. Good bye Mr. Maraczek. Good bye Arpad. All night circling the floor until dawn lit up the sky. [Applause] Whose there? Miss Balash. Who is it? Miss Balash. Oh just a minute. Oh Mr. Nowack. I was in the neighborhood. What do you want? Did you think of something you forgot to say last night? Well, say it please and get it over with. I'm not feeling very well today. Yes, I know you're not, that's why I'm here. You knew I was sick? How? Well, this might comes quite a shock to you Miss Balash but the fact is I'm back at Maraczek's again. Back at Maraczek's. As of this morning. And you've come here to see if I'm really sick, is that it? No. So, that you can tell everyone there's not a thing wrong with me. No. That I just don't care about my job. No. Well Mr. Nowack you are not going to have that chance. What time is it? I won't be very late. Where's my other shoe? Help me find my other shoe. Don't just stand there like that. Where's my shoe? I think you should lie down. Help me find my shoe. I can't leave until I do. Will you get me my hat? Where's my shoe. Please Miss Balash lie down. I hate to disappoint you, now that you've got your hopes up. Thrill to be doing something mean. Miss Balash do be sensible. Just tell me if it's cold out. Come help me pick a sweater. I can't decide of white or green. Now Miss Balash you are sick and you oath to lie down. Where did you put my shoe? That's a sneaky thing to do. You don't want me to go do you? I can see right through you. Where's my shoe? You shouldn't be on your feet. Where's my shoe? Be a good girl and go lie to. But if I were a shoe, where would I have gotten to? Well, if I were a shoe, I'd be there. Please Miss Balash lie down. Is it very cold? Yes, you told me it was cold. Tell me what kind of dress should I wear? You have fever, I think. I couldn't wear a sweater. That wouldn't suit my mood now. I feel like wearing something gay. Miss Balash you're hysterical. I am feeling so much better. I feel so gay and giddy. I wish you would know beyond thy way. You are going to bed which is where you belong. See, there is nothing wrong with me. I am going, you can't stop me. Stop it. Now, please drop me. Put me down. No, you're not leaving this room. Where's my shoe? You're going nowhere but back to bed. I have, I have, I brought you something. What? Here, see for yourself. What is it? Vanilla ice-cream. It's the best thing in the world when you're sick. Oh, it's from Lindner's. My mother works in Lindner's. She may have waited on you. A small stout woman? Oh no, the image of me everyone says only much younger looking. There's something wrong with this ice-cream. There is? It's so much salt. Well, are you, you're surprised all those tears falling into it. Oh, about to cry me at the direction. Why? Why, why, why, why cry at all? How little you understand Mr. Nowack, I'm like a ragdoll, somebody's kick out their stuff. Oh no, no, no, no. You'll soon fill up again, good as new. You're looking at a very disillusioned girl Mr. Nowack. You know Miss Balash I will never forgive myself for last night at the café. I must have been drunk. But strangely enough you were right Mr. Nowack. When you guess that I'd never met the man I was waiting for, he was just someone who'd been writing letters to me, such glorious letters. And he never showed up. I waited until closing. I feel very responsible. No, it wasn't just you Mr. Nowack, there could've been so many reasons but if he cared at all, he would've explained. He would've written a letter or a note, towards something. Miss Balash you are right. I would think so. Oh no, no, no he will, I'm not just guessing. I know it definitely. How? He told me himself. He, himself? Yes. Yes, yes, dear friend, no one else. Dear friend? When? How? Tell me Mr. Nowack, tell me. Well, let see now. Oh, when, when I left the café last night I have to oddest feeling that someone was following me and kept looking back and there was a... A young man. A man. And when I was almost home, he came up and he started asking questions about you and me. Oh, what sort of questions? Just, you what, what you, exactly what you would expect. No, no I want to know the words he said. I, I'm not very good at remembering exact words, so... Try. Please. Well, let see. I, I, I think the first thing he said was excuse me but I'd like to ask you a question or something like that and, and then he said, did you just leave the café Imperial, do you want to know what I said to? Of course. All right, I said, yes. And then? He, he, he said tell me. Tell me, that girl that you were sitting with is she a special friend of yours? Those are his exact words, "special friend". I said, no, no, no, we, we just work in a same shop together, as a matter of fact she has an appointment with someone else tonight. I'm remembering very clearly now. And, and, and then I remember he suddenly look quite sad. He looked sad? Quite sad and then he said, I know she has an appointment and it's me but I have to take the next train out of town on urgent business. Urgent business. Is he a manufacturer do you think or shop owner? It's hard to say. He certainly looked well fed. Well fed? To judge by appearances, of course that's not unusual in a man his age. You have some wonderful books here Miss Balash. Oh the red and the black, I've been so anxious to read this, I wonder, can I borrow it sometime? What? Can I borrow this. I promise to return it. What do you mean, the man his age? I beg your pardon? You said, not so unusual in a man his age, how old is he? Oh, well you realize it was dark night and he'd an exhausting day, emotionally at any rate. I would guess his age at of 50, 6, 7 it's hard to say very, possibly if he had some hair. Have you read the magic mountain? What? The, the magic mountain. I bought it for myself for my birthday. I'll lend it to you if you like. Is he completely bald? Does that matter? I thought you said you were in love with him? Oh, I am in love with him Mr. Nowack, I am, it's just that I thought, well, I'd hope, I am so ashamed of myself. As if appearances made a difference. The important thing is the letters. Just think about the immortal works of art, the, the rapture, his love stories that were written by elderly men, bald man, fat man. With indigestion and terrible tempers but inside, inside they had the magic and that is a glory beyond destination. You put it very well Miss Balash. I feel very well Mr. Nowack. I feel marvelous. Thank you so much for coming here today. Thank you for my life. I'm going to write to him this very minute so he'll have a letter waiting but I won't mention you as that might be embarassing. Yes, I would appreciate that. I, I should get back to the shop. Yes, I'll follow as soon as I've written the letter. Oh no, no, no that's not necessary. You take the rest of the day off, relax, read a book. Have you finish Anna Karenina yet? Oh yes, a long time ago. Sort did I but its remarkable how it stays with me. Every station platform with a train puffing in as Anna's platform, where ever it may be and I can see her. I can actually see her come out of the crowd and walk slowly toward her death. I've even tried to stop her a few times but she, she was vanishes in the smoking steam. Mr. Nowack how odd. How very odd, you know in one of his letters, no, I, I wish I could show it to you. You mean, dear friends had the same experience? More than once. Well goodbye Miss Balash. Goodbye. Wait, Mr. Nowack, may I tell you something quite sincerely? I like you, Mr, Nowack really. I like you. Thank you Miss Balash. I see you in the morning. In the morning. Okay. Dear friend, I am so sorry about last night. It was a nightmare in every way but together you and I we'll laugh at last night some day. Ice-cream, he brought me ice-cream, vanilla ice-cream, imagine that. Ice-cream and for the first time we were together without a speck. Friendly, he was so friendly. That isn't like him, I'm simply stun. One does never sings, one does never sees. It's been the most peculiar day. One does never sees, one does never sees, oh, where was I? I am so sorry about last night. It was a nightmare in every way but together you and I will we'll laugh at last night some day. I sat there waiting in that café and never guessing that you were fat... that you were near. You were outside looking bald, oh my. Dear friend, I am so sorry about last night. Last night I was so nasty, well, he deserved it but even so, that Georg is not like this Georg, this is a new Georg that I don't know. Somehow he'd all reminds me of Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but right over my eyes, a man that I despise has turned into a man I like. It's almost like a dream and as strange it may seem he came to offer me vanilla ice-cream. Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well. Well wonders never sees. I didn't like her, didn't like her, I couldn't stand her, couldn't stand her, I wouldn't have her. I never knew her but know I do and I could and I would and I know. She loves me and to my amazement I love it, knowing that she loves me, she loves me, true she doesn't show it, how could she, when she doesn't know it. Yesterday she loathe me but now today she likes me and tomorrow, tomorrow, my teeth ache from the urge to touch her. I'm speechless for I mustn't tell her. It's wrong now but it won't be long now before my love discovers that she and I are lovers. Imagine how surprise she's about to be. She loves me, she loves me. I love her, isn't that a wonder. I wonder why I didn't want her. I want her, that's the thing that matters, it matters are improving daily. Yesterday I loathe her, now today I love her and tomorrow, tomorrow, I'm tingling, such delicious tingles. I'm trembling, what the hell does that mean? I'm freezing, that's because it's cold out and still lighting condescends and likes amount of lesson. I'd like scroll on everyone I see. She loves me. She loves me. Oh, the Mr. married check. Not so impressive, too young and too skinny. I think his beautiful. Welcome back Georg. Congratulations Georg. Thank you. Excuse me but I could use some help in there. We do have costumers, you know. Say that reminds me I have to have a word with Mr. Kodaly. Isn't it wonderful? A miracle, an absolute miracle and a word with Mr. Kodaly. Who cares about that? That's all in the past. It is? Ever since last night. Do you remember what a silly confused girl I was last night? You were? Oh very. I didn't know what to do or where to go and somehow my feet started walking down the street, across the bridge, past the Metropole Cinema and do you know where? Where? Right into the library. The library? Can you imagine? How did you like it? You've never seen such a place, so many books. So much marble and so quiet and suddenly all of my confidence dribbled away with a pitiful plop. My head was beginning to swim and my forehead was covered with cold perspiration. I started to reach for a book and my hand automatically came to a stop. I don't know how long I stood frozen or victim or panic and mortification. How I wanted to flee then a kindly voice, a gentle voice whispered, pardon me. Oh, pardon me. And there was this dear, sweet, clearly respectable, thickly most spectacled man who stood by my side and quietly said to me, ma'am don't mean to intrude but I was just wondering are you in need of some help? I said, no. Yes I am. The next thing I know, I'm sipping hot chocolate and telling my troubles to Paul, whose tender brown eyes kept sending compassionate looks. A trip to the library has made a new girl of me for suddenly I can see the magic of books. I have to admit, in the back of my mind I was praying, he wouldn't get fresh and all of the while I was wondering why and a little bit girl should attract him, then all of a sudden he said, I couldn't go wrong with the way of all flesh. Of course it's a novel but I didn't know or I certainly wouldn't have smacked him. Well, he gave me a smile that I couldn't resist and I knew at once how much I like this optometrist. Optometrist? Op-to-me-trist. You know what this dear, sweet, slightly most spectacle gentleman said to me next, he said, he could solve this problem of mine. I said, how? He said, if I'd like, he'd willingly read to me some of his favorite things. I said, well. He said, now. His novel approach seemed highly suspicious and possibly dangerous too. I told myself wait, think, dare you go up to his flat. What happens if things go wrong, it's obvious his quite strong. He read to me all thy long. Now, how about that? It's hard to believe how truly domestic and happily hopeful I feel. I picture my Paul there reading aloud as I cook. As long as he's there to read there's quite a good chance in did, a chance that I'll never lead to open a book. Unlike someone else, someone I dimly recall. I know he'll only have eyes for me, my optometrist Paul. Well, I might as well tell you. Mr. Kodaly is leaving as right now, Mr. Maraczek's orders. Why? I mean it's nice but what happened? Well I'm afraid I can't tell you. Oh, I bet I know. I warned him they'd catch up with him. Do you know that half the perfume and toilet water from this shop ended up in his bathroom? I mean, he told me. Well, incidentally now that you're back and everything is all straightened out, I might as well tell you, I sent the anonymous letter. Ladislav, what anonymous letter? You didn't know? What do you think caused all the trouble? I wrote to Mr. Maraczek about his wife and one of our clerks. I can't believe you did that. I was desperate. Business was so bad and I thought to myself if he fires Mr. Kodaly who deserves it he might not fire me who doesn't. Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused? I'd regret it till the day I die but who ever dream Mr. Maraczek would've thought I meant you. Well, Ladislav I certainly hope you learn your lesson. Oh, I have. I have, believe me. In the next letter, name the names. That's not the le...no. The lesson is in... Miss Ritter I'll need two weeks pay for Mr. Kodaly. Oh here it is. No, no my pleasure. Good day madam, may I help you? Do you carry flowers of spring? Good day madam, Arpad. Mr. Sipos, guess what? What? I'm a clerk. Well, congratulations Arpad. Mr. Maraczek just promoted me. Oh and something else, I'm not Arpad anymore. Your not? Who are you? Mr. Laszlo. Why Laszlo? It's my last name. Thank you madam. Please call again, do call again, madam. Miss Ritter, may I present our new clerk, Mr. Laszlo. It's true, ask Mr. Maraczek. Oh Arpad how wonderful. What's wonderful? I'm a clerk, starting right now a clerk. Can you believe it. Steven Kodaly replaced by a delivery boy. Replaced? That's right Arpad, I'm leaving. I've just resigned. I wouldn't stay here another minute. You couldn't, you just been fired. All right, believe that if it makes you happy but you won't happy for long because any day now that door will close for the last time and then just take a walk over to Hammersmith's. Why? It's close. Only temporarily, for renovations. You see, they're going to have a new owner now, Steven Kodaly. Some owner. Nevertheless it's true. Ilona believes me, don't you darling? Of course I do. Here's your down payment. It's been grand knowing you, grand knowing you, grand thee in your friend. You've been kind, loyal and so generous, right down to the end. Please don't grieve watching me leave that would be much too painful to stand. It's been fun, now I must run but it's been grander for glee grand. Ilona, farewell, sherry be brave. Chin up, it's been sublimed. You mustn't waste a precious moment over me. You don't have time. Just remember when you're lonely or a blue there's a hollow in my pillow for you and Sipos, oh, what can I say? Ah Sipos, no tears be gay, you know, old friend I'm in your debt. I owe you more than I can possibly repay, I won't forget. Give your life a little kiss from Kodaly, I never met her but I will. Bye and bye, so I hate leaving you, hate leaving your warm intimate club. It's a small pleasure but I'll treasure its warm intimate stab. It's been grand, less me say and less me say au revoir, not goodbye for its grand knowing, you all be working for your friend, Kodaly.
