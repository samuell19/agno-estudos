What a complete mess. It's been over 10 years since the boat team moved out. It's a problem of jurisdiction. Wish the committee would make a decision. Right. Shall we go upstairs? Why not. - The stairs are in back. - Okay. Watch your step: Some floorboards are missing. I guess it'll just have to be torn down. Give It All Spring Term 1976 Good evening. I'm home. What are you doing? I thought I'd help. Leave it alone. There you are. Doesn't school start tomorrow? - Everything ready? - Sort of... Uniform and all that... I'm home. Dinner will be ready soon. Where have you been? I ran away. Really? Ran away? Take me with you next time. Nee-chan. A present for you. You should at least take a look at them. I'm impressed you got in. When do you go back to Kyoto? Doesn't university start soon? Not my classes. But I decided to leave in two days. Why so soon? For reasons a young girl can not know. Some man's waiting for you? Don't be silly. Etsuko, you're impulsive... Don't go falling in love at school. If you do, you'll soon drop out. You should join the badminton club like I did. What about boating? I've never heard of it. Anyway, badminton is right for you. Why? Because there are no cute boys. You make high school sound boring. I ran away today. Since I got in to Higashi High, there's nothing for me to do. But even when I ran away, nobody noticed. It's always boring at your age. - Nee-chan? - What? Didn't you used to help washing collars? Yeah, sometimes. Dad told me not to. Because you're so clumsy. There was some good news over spring break. The Senior exam results were excellent. Then our baseball team did very well. We're that much closer to the national finals. It's our school's 99th year. Next year will be the Centennial. The school motto is "Independence co-operation and motivation." This year, please address yourselves to "motivation." And I hope you have... ...many meaningful experiences on campus during this coming year. Student President Nakajima will launch the new school year. Higashi High. Give it everything! Everything! Give it all! All! Stand up! What's this? So you're a big fan of the cartoons? Which character is this? I'm asking you a question. It's not, Sir. Then what is it? It's a snowman, Sir. I don't like it. But he's arm-less Sir. You little shit! Don't get smart with me. Stand there! So you're as tough as ever. Boo the Crybaby... Your attention please. I represent the Boat Club. We train along the sea shore. It's very beautiful. Our club house is a nice, old building. Training camp is fun. We also help you prepare for your exams. Feel free to come see us. Excuse me! I would like to join the club. I forgot to mention. There's no girl's team. Sorry. Wish I could be on the boats. Hang on! If there isn't one... Then I'll start one. I'll start a club myself! Can I help you? I'd like to start a girl's boat team. A what? A boat team for girls. What are you talking about? Who are you? What class? My name is Etsuko Shinomura, freshman. There's no boat team for girls. I know. That's why I am here. I see. Have you done any rowing? No, Sir. You need at least five members... Four crew and a coxswain. You can't row by yourself. What are you going to do about the others? Any ideas? Thought so. No use then. I'll find them. Okay. Come back when you're ready. We'll talk again. But if there isn't a team, I won't get anyone. That makes sense. Please help me. While I'm happy that we've started a girl's team... You sound like the Principal. ...in spite of her efforts... ...we still lack four girls. - Use your charm to find them! - Forget it. - Why don't you get some? - Don't be stupid! Shut up all of you! We'll start by introducing ourselves. My name is Shinomura. Pleased to meet you. On the count of three. One, two, three! Take it slowly. Watch the rigger. - We're going upstairs. - Okay. This is the changing room. We'll need another room for girls. Use that small room for now. Boo! Bossy! Stop looking! What are you doing here? How about you? Peeping? I saw a light on... Sekino, you're late! I'm sorry. We're training with girls today. Except there's only one. This is Shinomura. Nice to meet you. Hello. You're on the rowing board? Yes. Could you show her? What? Same age... you should get along. How's Jiro? He died ages ago... In Junior school, you cried everytime he barked at you. It's your turn. Do you do it that slowly? Teach me properly. Do it yourself then. - Shinomura. - Yes, Sir. - Takada. - Yes, Sir. - Kusunoki. - Yes. - Toki. - Yes, Sir. You know I'm calling these out worst first. That first class... I was impressed. You were great. That snowman you drew... I couldn't do the test either but I pretended. Will you join the boat club? What? Go on. Well. My Mum says I shouldn't do sport. Welcome! May I sit here? One for me please. Are you Shinomura? Akko? - In Junior School... - The same class! I got picked on. But you always looked after me. Really? I don't remember. You moved to Hiroshima in fifth grade? Then Dad was transferred back again. I had no idea we were in the same school. Here you are. Watch out, it's very hot. Do you come here much? Taste hasn't changed since I was little. What club are you in... sports? Boating. Wow. That's cool. I'm in home economics. So ordinary. Why don't you come see us practice Saturday? Sorry... I'm more suited for home economics. Promise it's only until the Freshman Championship? Sure... 'til October. I don't need to row, right? Don't worry, the cox just watches. Only 'til October too, right? That's what you said. If you're not sure, you shouldn't do it. I made up my mind when I joined. Did you persuade your Mum? She's okay. Promise is a promise, right? It's too late for that. If you hate it, quit anytime. Look, it's the sea! Where are you all going? I was supposed to finish in June, but Shinomura asked me, so... I'll be coaching you for a while. Thank very much. Anybody done any sport? - You can all swim? - Yes. - Well... - What? How good do we have to be? How far can you swim? About 10 meters. Can't call that swimming! It's alright. There are life belts on board. Besides, if you capsize, you shouldn't swim. Hold on and wait for help is the rule. But you'd better learn to swim a bit more. Shall I teach you? Let's start with a jog. Mitsuhama, go, go... They're all looking at us. Dirty devils. Got to be careful of high school boys. Nobody's watching you. Ready to lift? Two, three! Again. Two, three! This won't work. First years down here! - Are you really carrying this? - Yes. Don't let go yet! Don't let go 'til I say! Keep going into the water. Okay, let go! - Don't drag it! - Okay. Watch where you walk. Not sat down yet? Cute enough but so dim... Shall we try to row then? Nice and gently. Ready on the oars? Everybody ready, wait! On the second 'ready,' oars go into the water... 'Ready' - splash... 'Row' - pull... Splash... pull... splash... pull. - Got it? - Yeah. Ready, row. What's wrong bow? My seat came out. Your seat? Easy all. 'Easy all' means stop rowing! Stop rowing... stop. What is it No. 2? My oar is stuck... ouch! You've caught a crab. - For real? - Don't be stupid. Excuse me! What is it now? Can I go... I can't hear you! Toilet... I need to go to the toilet. There no toilet out here. We can't go back whenever you feel like it. No. 3, what's wrong? Sea sick? Going to spew? Are you okay? Can you row? It's best if I keep moving. Let's go back now. That's it for today. Get the rudder. You know what that is right? Yes, it's the steering. That's the cox's job. Right. Are you alright? It's not deep. Thank God. Uh-oh... Mind your eyes don't pop out! Idiots! Shit. This is harder than rowing myself. Just because it's the summer break, don't slack on your studies. You've got to start preparing for the entrance exam soon. It's going to get harder and harder. From today, I'm going to choose who answers at random. Since some of you just prepare one answer in advance. Who's it going to be? Uh-oh. She won't know the answer. And pigs might fly... How come no-one's here... is it a holiday? I bet they're slacking. Shall we give up? But we came all this way. We can't carry that heavy thing. Let's ask the Mitsuhama bunch. - Who's going to go? - Himé. - No way, they'll kidnap her. - I'm scared. Who then? Etsuné! All right... Excuse me! Ready to go? Ready, row! Pancake House - Is it done? - Not yet. Weren't they great? I saw them in the newspaper. "Unstoppable Mitsuhama High." The guy in the bow is so cool. Really? No. 2 was better. No way... him in the bow. Aren't I right, Himé? Well, I prefer the stroke. He's nice. But so was the cox. It's full. Wow. What a surprise. I wish our boys were like them. What about Sekino? - He's alright. - And kind. Etsuné, how come you never talk to him? Don't you like him? She's self-conscious. Because she likes him? Get lost! Who'd like Boo? We were in kindergarten together. Really? You've known him that long? That's nice. - Who's your favorite, Rih? - Me? - My favorite is... this. - Mine, too. Don't you love noodles too? Of course I do! Training Camp Schedule Training Camp Schedule Training camp? More like homework camp. Ouch! It's swollen. Looks nasty. I'll get some cream. Yuck. My precious hands, all messed up. Isn't dinner ready yet? I'm starving... Rih, you're really good at cooking. I've been doing it since I was little. Really. I don't have a mother. She got sick and died. I didn't know. I'm sorry I lied to you. Saying my Mum didn't want me to do sport. Oh no, that's okay. The truth is I was happy when you asked me. But since I have to look after myself... ...and study for college, maybe it wouldn't work out. What does your father do? He's a skipper... goes all the way to Africa. I always wanted somebody to tell me what I wasn't allowed to do. My parents don't say a thing. Not since my brilliant sister got into Kyoto University. They don't give a shit about me. Is dinner ready? Not yet! It's nice to be together like this. Yeah. Rih... are you asleep? No. Dakko? I can't sleep. Me, too. Imochi? Imochi? What? I just got to sleep. We can't sleep... I've got something special. The last one to go out has to confess something. Like what? Name of your sweetheart. And if you do, he'll think the same thing. Oh my God... it's exciting. I want it to go out and yet I don't. I hope it's me. I don't believe that stuff. Oh, no... Too bad, Imochi. Who's it going to be? Etsuné tell us before it goes out! Say it quick. Quickly. What? You didn't say we had to do it before it went out. Doesn't matter. There's no-one I like. Let's do some bigger ones. It's a long course. Must be 1000 meters. The water here looks thicker than the sea. How many schools competing? Five teams including us. That's all? We might beat one of them. Most of them will be second years. But there might be some B-crews. I'm nervous already. No point in getting nervous now. Anyway, the cox is supposed to stay cool. Aren't you nervous, Etsuné? Of course I am! Me, too. And me. Dakko too? 'She of the steel mask'? I guess I forgot to wear it today. Ouch! We'll carry them for you. I'll carry my own. She sounds tough. Sorry. Good luck, Higashi High. We've got to get a good start to win. Don't be too nervous. Ready to go? Bow side row. Stroke side reverse. Ready. Row. Imochi, your oar is the wrong way round. More to the right... er... left. No... no... the right. That's too far. The Qualifying Race All ready. Stage boat ready? Prepare to start. Ready Iyo-Higashi? Ready Maehama? Ready Nibari? Ready, go! Beat those Princesses. Stroke side, harder! Slow down! Etsuné slow down! Hold up on the bow! Last two hundred. Last stretch. What's wrong No. 2? My seat came out. Stroke pair, ready. The Consolation Race Himé. You did well today. I can't give up like this. We knew we'd lose but... To be called the 'Princess Crew'... What about you, Rih? Me? I'm always with you guys. That was horrible. Thought I'd die. But that's it... bye-bye to blisters. Back to being a normal girl. Hooray. What's wrong? So there is one princess among us. What time's practice tomorrow? Maybe about nine? What... you're going to keep at it? Shall we go then? But... wait... wasn't the deal up until this race? They've just started. Come on, Higashi High! You're in good spirits considering you lost! Come on, Higashi High! Come on, Higashi High! Come on, Sekino! Thank you all. The cox doesn't have to join our training, Himé. I'm on a diet. Way to go, Himé! I want to lose weight, too. No! Rowers need to put on weight and gain strength. Someone you know? No. Can we help you? Aren't I allowed to watch? If you like... I'm sorry to be late! Hello. This is Akiko Irie. I asked her to coach you once a week. Once a week? She has a job of her own. Right... You don't seem very happy. You always wanted a proper coach. Pleased to meet you. Hello. She made a training routine. Make sure you do it. I wonder if she ever rowed? Doubt it. What's on the list? Six different types of barbell, three sets of ten reps. 300 reps on rowing board. 3 sets of 100 abdominal crunches. 3 sets of 100 push ups. 10 laps of the field. On Saturdays, sprinting up and down the temple steps. That's... for how many days? She doesn't say a word. I heard she used to be a cox. Same as me. She was in the all-Japan champion team. That's amazing! That attitude... it's the real thing. Someone like that... in our town. But she used to live in Tokyo. Is she from Tokyo, then? No, she's from near here. Why did she come back? Right! Something must have happened. Like what? Coming back here at that age. Something wrong in Tokyo... definitely. Something? Well, I don't know, but you can imagine. I can imagine what you're thinking... Three more laps. Has training finished? Are you all right? You're slightly anaemic. Had it before? Sometimes. But I'm okay now. You should have a check-up in hospital. Really, I'm fine. I'll walk you home. Don't worry. I'm on my bike anyway. Alright. See you tomorrow. Etsuné. We didn't carry you to the clinic. Who did? Sekino. I thought you should know. Okay. Take care. Thanks. Get on. Stop, I'll walk from here. Don't overdo the training. I'm not. Keep the gloves. No thanks. Bossy. Boo. - I'm home. - Welcome back. Grandma, I've a favour to ask you. I'm broke, if that's what you're after. Yesterday, I bet on the races and lost. It's not money. Could you clean these... in secret. A boy's? Should keep this quiet. You're the only one I can count on. Etsuné, look! Momoko from gymnastics. Flapping her wand and flirting. Typical boy... lazing around. Do you think they're together? Hey, wait for me! It's still pretty cold. Are we really going out on the water today? So you'd like to go back to land drill? No! The water's fine. It's spring break and you should be rowing as much as you can. Call yourself rowers? Not if you can't carry your own boat. Hold tight. Two... three. It's up! I can't believe it. Don't stand gawping... get it to the water! Hurry up. I can't hold it for long. Coach? Aren't you going to say anything? Like what? About the way we row... or train. You're all having a good time? Isn't that enough? We want to get better. What for? To win. Is winning so great? Please teach us properly. We don't care what happened in Tokyo. You've all got into bad habits. Keep your bodies straight. Easy all. You won't get any faster like this. Learn to control your strength through the oar. Let's do the two patterns, arm and leg. Standby for arm only. Cox, we can't hear you! Ready arm only! Ready, row! Thank you very much. - I'll get water. - Go ahead. Coach. We're going to eat pancakes. It's just by the station. If you'd like to come... Thanks... but no thanks. You all get on my nerves. Always jabbering away... I can't stand it. Let's ask Student President Yamamoto, to launch the new school year. Higashi High. Give it everything! Everything! Give it all! All! My name is Onishi. Pleased to meet you. Only one freshman... it's kind of sad. It'll be different after the school race. That's where Etsuné picked us up. Tricking us with talk of the wonderful club house. I heard the same thing. So you were tricked too? No! She came to me first. It'll work out... we'll keep trying. - Let's keep at it. - Fingers crossed. It'll be fine. Etsuné your body's all crooked. Are you all right? Sorry... I'll be fine. Etsuko, wake up! Get a move on! I can't... What? What's that? You lazy lump. What's wrong? I can't move... You've strained your back. No boating from now on. Get yourself treated. Even then, it'll take a while. - Onishi, don't look down. - Okay. On 'catch,' really dig the oar in. Etsuko, your friend's here! Coming. This is delicious. Don't eat it if you don't want to. Sorry that this is all there is. Not at all. I love it. Can I have another? We start training for the qualifiers tomorrow. Everyone's really going for it. Do an extra bit for me. How is your back? I'll not make the qualifiers... But I'll be ready for the championships. We're all waiting for you. Is Onishi any good in my place? She's quite powerful at least... Why don't you have dinner with us? I should get back. Go on. Let's eat together. How many nights? Two if we make it through. Maybe it'll rain... So take plenty of clean underwear! If we win... we're through to the Nationals. With Etsuné. Where is it this year? We've got to get off the bottom rung first. Push harder, stroke! Harder! Come on, stroke! Come on, altogether! Easy all. You're not still over-doing it are you? Not at all. When will I get better? It'll take at least six months. Even then, you can forget rowing. What are you doing? Coming or not? There's folks waiting. You're in the rowing team, right? Boats are great eh? In the old days, this was a row boat too. Come on, altogether! Hey... Bossy. Heard you pulled your back. Leave me alone. Going home already? Guess they don't need you now with that new girl. Piss off back to Momoko. What's that supposed to mean? I'm home. You're late. You weren't rowing were you? I've given up rowing. That's good. Anaemia... then this. I'm sick of worrying about you. It's for the best. It's no good at all! These new shirts don't starch well. Come on, stroke! Last stroke! Last again. When will we ever win? If only we had Etsuné. Her back's still bad. I apologize. No... it's not your fault. Didn't mean it like that. It's okay. But it was close eh? Just half a length. When you lose... you lose. Coach. What are you doing here? Grandma said the hot spring is good for my back. Right. Do you come here much? It's the first time. Nothing better to do. Here is some tea. Thanks. Don't you have a boyfriend? Give me a break! What do you girls call me? 'Belenko.' 'Belenko'? That weird Russian guy who flew over in his Mig? 'Belenko'... Shall I tell you what happened to me? No. I don't want to hear it. Do you know the 'Festival of Lights'? What's that? They fill this temple with candles. It's beautiful. So what though... It's all so boring. Have a go? No fight left in you is there? I've known lots of rowers with bad backs. Went through treatment and then came back. You can still slug a ball at least? What's up? Try again. You know... Rowing is all I've got. C'mon... here's another! Etsuné! Use your legs. Nice and gentle. Slowly. Training Camp Schedule Ready for a thousand strokes. All ready. Ready, row! Harder! Bow side, harder! Altogether, harder! Why are you scraping the handle? You don't grip the oar... you just hang on to it. This way, you'll get the angle of the blade right. And you need that. When my American coach explained this... I didn't get it. It's tricky, but I want you to understand too. Etsuné one slow stroke. When the oar hits the water, there's that sound. You should feel that all the way up the oar. Water is a living thing... get it to help you. If you fight with it, it'll turn to concrete. Try it... slowly. Stand-by... ready, row. Listen to each other's breathing. You're not on your own, you're one crew. Training camp's over. I'll miss you. There's no 'next year.' It's so beautiful. You're up against Maehama and the Nibari A-crew. Forget Nibari but at least keep up with Maehama. Relax... as long as you're not last, you're through. Give it everything. The Qualifying Race Last five hundred! Come on! Come on, stroke! Come on, nearly there! We won! We really won! I still can't believe we won. At least we weren't last. But think about it... If we win tomorrow at the semi-final... ...we're in the final and if we win there... Lake Biwa, National Championships, the Asahi Regatta! Like a dream. I don't think we should be dreaming. It's easier to think... ...'as long as we're not last.' You're right. Let's keep to that. Etsuné, your turn. White Dry Cleaning. Dad, it's me. I'm staying another night. How's your anaemia? It's fine. And your back? It's nothing. We won today and tomorrow if we... A customer... got to go. Thank you very much. Rih, are you asleep? No, I'm not. I can't sleep. Me neither. Remember the camp last year? Such good fun. I didn't bring any fireworks this time. Imochi, I thought you were asleep. Fireworks, cards, swimming... Those days won't come back. Great times. We're still only seventeen. But only once. How will we be when we're twenty? ...or thirty or forty? Please. I can't imagine even 10 years from now. I wish it could be like this forever. The Semi-Final Push harder! Nearly there! Come on! We did it! We're not last! Looking at you... I remember when rowing was everything. I thought it was wrong of me. But that's not true. You're alright, you are. Wish I could be out there with you, yelling away. Himé let her have a go! If you're that relaxed, you'll be fine. If you're that relaxed, you'll be fine. Go on then. Let's go. Don't think about it. Just do what we always do. You're right. It'll be what it will be. At least we came up from rock bottom. So there's no regrets. There are. My hands. That's how much I put into this. So let's get to the final. We've all been through a lot. Let's get to Lake Biwa! Shall we do that thing? Higashi High. Give it everything! Everything! Give it all! All! The Final Race 35 Girl's Cox Four. Lane 1 Iyo-Higashi. Lane 2 Satajima. Lane 3 Nibari-North. Lane 4 Nibari-South. Ready. Ready Iyo-Higashi? Ready Satajima? Ready Nibari-North? Ready Nibari-South? All ready, go! Come on. You can do it! We're gonna beat you! Altogether... pull! Stroke rate 32. Last five hundred. Higashi High, go for it! Higashi High, go for it! Last 200, come on! Bossy! Etsuné! Etsuné! Bossy! All together! Come on, pull! Harder... harder! Use your legs! All together, come on! Himé... Himé. How did we do? We lost? We won't be back here for a while. It gets dark so quickly. Another season of winter training. So much happened. Yeah. Do you remember getting pushed off the 'jungle gym' in kindergarten? Yeah. Remember who pushed you? Of course not. It was me. Really. Teacher took me to apologize. Told you to forgive me... But you never said a word. Stubborn as hell. I always have been. Damn right. That strength... That's what I like about you... You're alright. Etsuko. Never give up! Subtitles by Aya Futami & Kennedy Taylor
