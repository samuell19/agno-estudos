My granma is Rahma Saidah. Before she died she wrote you this letter. She didn't mail it. Alright thank you. In the letter, she asked for your help to save us. To save us from what? Your grandma has never taught you manners? Not to read someone else's letter? I'm so sorry. Want to wait inside? Till I read this So I'll understand what the hell you're talking about? I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. Your grandma and I were friends since primary school. We were very close. So close we never dated each other. She ended up marrying my classmate. They only got one son. Your father. When your dad married your mom She never gave her blessings. Why? Back then Being an artist wasn't considered dignified. And it took so long for your mom to bear a child. But my grandma and my mom were okay. Yes after you were born. But then After your mom fell ill for years, Your grandma became suspicious. Of what? She believed your mom... didn't ask for children from God. So from who? From Satan. And you believe this? Your grandma believed it. I don't understand about this Satan worship thing. How do you do that? Isn't this just fictious? If you believe so, why you come here? Something happened at home? I don't want to. Don't want to kill my little brother. I love my little brother. I don't want to. I love my brother. There's my article in here. Read it. It might help you. Time for your massage, Sir? You lost your specs again? I bought a new pair. But people said they're ugly.

I want... ...you ...to die. "Unintelligible words in reverse" "Chanting in ancient language" Where's Ian? Did you see Ian? I just woke up. Find him! You know I'll always be here for you, right? So will Tony. And Bondi. Where did you get this from? A friend of Granma's. I met him yesterday. Have you read it? What for? Just a stupid magazine about the occult. What? "EXPOSING THE DEVIL WORSHIP FERTILITY CULT" It tells story of a woman who's been married for 10 years and cannot have a child. and finally gave birth to a child. By asking from Satan, in a cave... or in a sacred mountain. No. Not in a cave or mountain. This article says, in cities there are satan-worshipping cults... which are related to fertility. What does it mean? Someone who wishes to have a child... but barren They can join the cult Then they'll get pregnant. Well that's good, right. As long as they can have a child. But However, the last child must be given to the cult to be sacrificed when he reaches 7 years old. So what's point of having it then? Well, only the last child. When he reaches 7 years old. So what's your point? Okay. How old are you? Twenty two. I'm sixteen. and Bondi is ten. And? What if Mom didn't have the heart to give us to that cult so before her last child reaches 7 years old Mom always had a new baby. You know nobody takes this magazine seriously, right? Do you remember When Mom still performed I always accompanied her. Yeah I hate attending those and socializing. Everytime she had an event There were always a group of people Never mingled with others But they were always there. This is them. This one. This one. This one. And this one. Perhaps mom's schoolmates? Once I asked them myself They kept their mouth shut. The last child Seven years old. Ian turns seven in three days. But the article says The child can only be taken if his family gives him up. Taken how? That's the part that I don't believe. What does it say? It says that the promised child will be taken by... the living dead. Good thing it says that. I'm so relieved. If it says they will kidnap him, maybe I would believe it. Could be a metaphor, an analogy. I'm hungry. Stop reading this trash. Or you'll go cuckoo. You sure you saw her? I'm sure, Ustad. Your grandma? Grandma. Show me your mother's room. Dead people don't bother the living. They're usually other beings imitating the ones you love to tear your family apart. Is it safe now? I can only ask for help from God. So nothing will disturb you again. Thank you for your help, Ustad. Do you pray? We don't. But you know how? We do. Then pray. Pray before Allah surrender whole heartedly to Allah almighty. Because all beings are afraid of Him. If you pray but not whole heartedly you'll still be vulnerable. Ustad, can we... Get in. We shouldn't have run away. If that really was Mother. We ask her not to disturb us anymore. That wasn't mom. A Jinn? There are other beings beside humans and djinns. They've been around before religions existed. What do they want from humans? Harvesting human souls that they plant. Is there a way to defeat them? According to the article, we can't defeat them. But we can disobey their rules. What do you mean? They won't be able to take a child Unless he's given up by his family. So we just have to stick together. Let me get that. Sister, There's something else in the magazine. What? Women in that cult weren't impregnated by their husbands. So by whom? by the men in the cult. You're saying... You ever think why the four of us look very different from each other? Many siblings don't look alike. Not like us. Budiman called. Something important came up. But I have to look after my brothers Let me go there. I'll go with you. No need. But I need to know. Look after your sister and the little ones. You sure? Of course. I'll go straight home afterwards. See you soon. We'll hold a mass prayer at your house We'll invite the villagers Thank you, Ustad. Sorry for giving you trouble. Not at all. Houses in which the inhibitants don't pray will be easily occupied by Satan It will be hard to get rid of it. Where's Rini? She's looking after her brothers I can take your message to her. This is my latest article. If we wait until it's published it will be too late Too late for what? Give this to Rini. Rini is my friend. I'm helping her. Please tell me what's going on. Where's that knife? Oh here it is. Lucky you didn't get cut. Who's that? Massage, Sir. Didn't I say later tonight? I can't tonight. Open this door, Sir. Ustad. Peace be upon thee. Sir... Daddy! I got home, you weren't there. What are you doing here? Many things happened while you're gone. Let's go home. Tomorrow we pack things up. Take only what we need. We move to a flat downtown. Now go to bed. Get up early. I apoligize for leaving you guys. You should but not just for that. I saw you speak to mom the night she died. What did you say to her? I meant well. I want happiness for my kids. And your mom to find peace. What did you say to her? I love my children. And I love your mother. But I think my children should not to suffer You gave up on her. Ian! Ian! Dad! Dad! Help! Dad! What happened?! Someone locked Ian in! Ian! Step aside! Dad... Dad... Throw down the rope! Grab this. Pull hard! Take Ian first! Take Ian! Who are they? Definitely not our neighbors. What the hell do you want from us?! Rini get inside! Get inside! Watch over your brother. They're surrounding us. What are they doing? They come to take Ian. They can't as long as we don't let them. Bondi... Bondi... I love you... Mother! Please help my children. Bondi... Bondi... Mawarni... Please save our children. Bondi... This is my fault. Forgive me. Bondi... I love you... Daddy! Are you hurt? You can't take any of my children! We won't let you! If you still dare to do so Come forward! Fight me! Come forward! Dad get inside! They're gone. They're all gone. What time will the car arrive? 4 P.M. Dad, you sure you have money for rent? God willing. And if I work hard enough I'll be able to pay back the house. I don't think you should do that. Well, I won't then. Better buy a small house, but lots of neighbors. Okay, let's just leave the furnitures. We'll buy new ones I'm super loaded now. Filthy rich. Can you believe that? You can't? Neither can I. When we reach downtown, We drop our stuffs, then we go out We'll celebrate Ian's birthday at midnight. That must be our ride. Oh hi, Ustad. Peace be upon thee. I heard you're moving out. I came to wish you a good journey. Thank you. I'm going for a walk. Please. Thank you for taking care of the kids Forgive me for not able to help last night. To be honest, I'm still in shock. My deepest condolences Please regard my kids as yours I appreciate that. Ustad, something to drink? Thank you. - What about you, Dad? - Tea, please. If I had a car, I would've taken you downtown. Don't worry about it. Our ride must've had some engine problem. It's 10.30. We should just go to bed. Ian will have his birthday at midnight. We can set the alarm for midnight. You guys have been packing since morning. If it's okay, can I stay here for a while? I feel so lonely at home. Of course it's okay. You guys go to bed. I'll wake you up later. Haven't we paid the electricity bill? I think it's a general blackout. Let me get the kerosene lights. Let's go, Tony. "Satan's Grand Plan to Spread His Seeds' By: Budiman Syailendra" Tony, wake up. Has the birthday party started? Have you ever been haunted by grandma's ghost? No. I haven't. Neither has Bondi. Only Ian has been haunted. So? This is Budiman's new article. Apparently he gave it to Hendra. This one revises the previous article. What does it revise? The last child from the cult will be taken not as a sacrifice. But because they're Satan's offsprings. What if grandma was trying to help us all along? Sister, Listen to yourself. This is nuts. Ian is our little brother. We take care of him since baby. There's something else. Tell me. The cult members don't come to the house, not to take the Satan's child. But to leave signs for his shepherds. Who are the shepherds? It's mother. "Talking in ancient language" Ian, what are you doing? Talking to my friends. Hendra... Mawarni... Your brothers. Ustad... Dad. Where's Ian? What the hell is going on? Where's Ian? - What do we do now? - We stay here. We have to find Ian. No don't. What's with you? Your brother is out there! Step aside. Ian! Ian? Come here, Daddy. Dad get inside. Come here, Daddy. Granma! Rini! Come quick! Drive now, please! C'mon, c'mon! Let's go! Quickly! They're getting close! NOW! NOW! Ian! He's not your son. He's never been. "ONE YEAR LATER" Hi, I bring you some food.
