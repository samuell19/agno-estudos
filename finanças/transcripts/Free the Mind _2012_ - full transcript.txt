We actually have no idea how conscious experience arises - - from this blob of matter that weighs three pounds. It's really still very much a mystery. Will, it's not good for your face, honey. Do you want to take a break? Are you okay? Good job. So for trick or treating today ... We have elevators, right? I know that you didn't have a good time in one of them. Your mom and dad weren't in there with you. But I'm gonna be there with you today. Now ... I think there are three floors we need to go to. I would like you to choose one, just one time - - that you can either go up or down one floor. And I'll be with you the whole time. I don't want to go in the elevator. I know, honey. But there's gonna be some day - - that you go into a huge building, a long time from now - - and you won't want to take all those stairs all the time. Okay? I do want to take the stairs all the time. All the time? It'll take forever, if you're up in a tall building. Remember when that happened to you - - were you by yourself in the elevator or with somebody? By myself. Do you think you'll get stuck in there, if you have your teachers with you? Nope. You'll be safe. How about you and I take the stairs to the 2nd floor - - and then we'll take the elevator one time to number ... - Four. - Yeah! And then ... But then ... listen, take a deep breath. It's okay. I'm scared. Okay, honey. It's gonna be okay. Let's have a little bit of water. We're just gonna take the elevator one time, honey. I promise the rest of the day we're gonna take the stairs. So that means ... it's okay. It's okay, honey. - I don't wanna go trick or treating. - You don't wanna go trick or treating? Really? You wanna sit in the comic room while all your friends go trick or treating? That won't be fun, honey. How about if you and I do an elevator a different day? Today is way too important. I don't want you to miss the trick or treating. Do you need a hug? It's okay. It's okay. We'll do the elevator a different day. - Not today? - Not today. Drink your water, okay? I'm gonna go talk to the other teachers about it, okay? Will you finish your water? Is everything up there gonna be scary? No, nothing's gonna be scary, everybody's gonna be happy with you. It's the brain changing the brain. We know that the brain changes all through our life - - but we just don't know how that happens. When you're in the military, you're asked to ... ... do things that in everyday life are considered wrong. The person I had to be to do my job was a horrible person. In my eyes. A horrible person. And I was good at it. Okay, we'll clean this up, and then we'll open that one. Lawrence, why don't you come help clean up, too? Come on, Emilia. Put this in there. Put that in there. Thank you. Put this in there. Clean up. Help clean up. Before I joined the army, it was very rare that I would get to the point - - where I am so angry at somebody that I'm balling up my fist - - and I'm preparing to hit them. It happens a lot now, and you know ... ... it's not a feeling I wanna have around them. Suicides among the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan - - are reaching epidemic proportions. Some 1,000 suicide attempts - - are happening every month. How can we say we're taking care of our troops, when we have - - an increasing number of soldiers taking their own lives? "The soldiers seemed to be suffering classic symptoms of PTSD: Explosions of anger, suicidal and homocidal ideation, flashbacks ..." We'll meet you at the next floor, okay? We won't leave without you. I wrote the diary while I was deployed overseas in Iraq. I kept it and used it the way you'd use a friend or someone to talk to. November 9th is blank because at the time it was ... ... not a day that I wanted to write down and remember. On the 9th of November I went out with my platoon into Baghdad - - and we had stopped in the Green Zone - - on the parade grounds for Saddam, and we were taking a platoon picture. As we passed by one of the other COPs - - we heard an extremely large explosion. It was very different than the others. It sounded a little higher pitched. Like thunder clapping instead of the deep roll we were used to. I started to receive updates from our battalion. One of our sister units in the area - - an MP unit that was in Humvees, had been hit by an IED. And ... I can remember that we pulled up behind them. And as I looked up further laying there in the road was ... I think it was the gunner, and he had ... ... he had quadruple amputation. He was ... uhm. He was not doing well, and we started to work on him - - and I got my medic up there, and we did what we could to stabilize him. Got a stretcher out. In the meantime we'd called for a helicopter to get him out of there. Got him loaded on the helicopter, and the helicopter took off. It felt like that took forever. It probably took less than 5 minutes. Then the tough task of picking up the remains of the 2 people killed started. Their bodies were pretty mangled and torn up. And it got very difficult to ... ... even identify what you were cleaning up. The sense, the smells, the images, the sounds, the ... Some of those pictures I'll never forget. I take Ambien to get to sleep every night. Without the medication I've gone nights without sleeping. I don't like what I did. There are practices designed - - to promote beneficial qualities in a person Compassion meditation is a kind of meditation we've studied extensively. There's a region of the brain called the insula, and it's an area - - that's literally used for interacting between the mind and the body. This area of the brain is dramatically enhanced - - in its activation during compassion meditation - - and will enable practitioners - - who practice compassion meditation regularly - - to feel the emotion of others more easily. We have found that 3 months of meditation practice - - lead to changes on certain measures of attention that reflect - - a person's capacity to pick up on small changes in his environment. A lot of our daily lives are spent in social interaction - - where we interact with other people. And the reality is - - that much of that information is not conscious, we're just not aware of it. After 3 months of meditation practice people are able to notice - - much more subtle things in their environment - - which would lead people to be better at picking up on others. Research indicates that emotional intelligence - - is a far more important ingredient in life - - than traditional cognitive intelligence. So our ability to pick up on the emotions of others - - to understand our own emotions, to regulate our attention - - those are qualities which can make a big difference - - in terms of life's success. Does anyone think this is a real brain? - No, no. - No. Our real brain is not coloured like this, is it? This is a model of a brain. The brain is probably - - the most complicated thing that exists in the whole universe. Scientists estimate that it has 10 billion connections - - which is a 1 with many, many, many zeros following it. We can feel all the different feelings that we feel because the brain - - is as complicated as it is. You mean like, if you're feeling sad or ... How else might you feel? - Frustrated. - Frustrated! - How else? - Mad! Angry. There are different parts of the brain that become active when we have - - feelings of sadness and feelings of frustration - - and feelings of happiness. And we can change our brains for the better. And that's something that is possible for every single person. And one of the really cool things is - - that Laura is actually gonna be teaching you some exercises - - which can help you change your feelings. You can be happier, and you can feel kinder - - toward all of your friends more easily. Hey, what's that? Your teachers invited me to come in here to teach you some things. And guess how I feel on the inside about that. - Happy. - I feel happy. And I also feel really excited. So, what we're gonna learn about - - is a brand new word maybe for some people. It's called mindfulness. Can you say that? Mindfulness. Two important things happen with mindfulness. One is: mindfuldness means paying attention. And it looks like almost everyone is paying attention. The other thing about mindfulness is - - when you pay attention what happens to your body? - Does it get all busy? - No. You know what happens to your body when you're paying attention? It gets slow. You can pay attention on the outside - - and you can pay attention on the inside. So the first thing we're gonna do today is pay attention on the inside. Is everybody ready? Have you ever done that before? No? So, I brought something. - Rice. - You think it's rice. How does it feel in your body to think about what's in there? I'm gonna open the container and see what's inside, are you ready? Who knows what that is? Will? Uhm ... a bell. We're gonna listen, and when the bell stops - - when you can't hear it anymore, raise your hand. Ready? With growing concern about doctors prescribing Ritalin and other drugs - - to treat ADHD it's important to know there are other options. Someone diagnosed with ADHD doesn't have to spend - - every waking minute on medication. What do you know? Live from Atlanta, Georgia to San Antonio, Texas - - this is 'Whad'Ya Know' from Wisconsin Public Radio - - and PRI, Public Radio International. Richard Davidson is here. Come on, Richard. We're not formal here. Richard Davidson from the Center for Healthy Minds. The University of Wisconsin. For those of you who didn't think there were - - healthy minds at the university, Richard's here to prove you wrong. Was there such a field as this before? Not really. We call it contemplative neuroscience. So you're thinking about neuroscience. Well it is the neuroscience of contemplative practice. Contemplative practice has to do with taking intentional control of our mind. Do we not ordinarily have control over our minds? I would say that ordinarily we have very little control of our mind. We may think we have control, but we really don't. We can actually be happier people. We can suffer less - - if we take responsibility for our own mind. Here's my room. My flag, my bed, my NASCAR sheets. And there's a picture of Alex. I'm joined by Dr. Richard Davidson Vilas Professor - - of psychology and psychiatry. Richie is a recipient of the APA's - - Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award and was named - - 1 of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine. We are about to launch a very large evolve study - - with returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Veterans who are suffering tremendously. Many of them have post-traumatic stress disorder. So, thank you guys for being part of this study. It's a real honour to have each of you here. We are interested in the examination of methods that may be ... Non-pharmacological methods that may be helpful - - in calming your autonomic nervous system - - like your cardiovascular system and certain hormones. We're interested also in methods that may help calm the mind. Some of the same methods can do both. And we're interested in using the best of scientific research - - to understand and to track how these interventions - - may actually be producing their effects. Thank you. For this study we've invited 20 participants and we're dividing them - - into an active group and a control group. The active group is going to have the intervention. It's a breathing-based practice 7 days in a row - - about 3 hours a day, so it's an intensive program - - and it allows us to take measures right before and after, and if we see - - any changes in 7 days, that would be pretty extraordinary. That'll be good. He's hearing brief noises. Every time it goes up, it's a noise, so he ... We're measuring that. Okay, we just saw it. See that reaction? About 50% of veterans who are doing treatment for PTSD - - a more standard treatment, respond, and 50% do not respond at all. There's a real need to understand different interventions - - that might be helpful for people. You can remove the ear phones. Are you good to go, or do you need a break? We're also giving them open-ended questionnaires - - for example words or sentences they need to complete. Do they complete them with more negative words or positive words? Do they complete the sentences with words related to war or trauma? "The silence was broken by the bomb." "His heart raced with despair." "He sprayed the whole area with pesticide." "His friend had a big hole in his chest." "The unfortunate man lost his leg." Anybody here felt an overwhelming emotion - - in the last 2-3 months: Anger, sadness, fear? Combat trauma and PTSD in its simplest form is an experience - - that happened to somebody that was so traumatic - - that though their body's in the present, their mind got stuck there. How many had experiences like that? The same memory keeps coming back. The same experience gets lived over and over again. But we're gonna find ways that help us live more in the present. - What's the first thing we do in life? - Cry. We cry and then ... take a breath. - What's the last thing we do in life? - Exhale. And then other people cry. And between this and this is life and our breath. And how many of us have paid attention to our breath? Like right now, where's your breath? Do you breathe here? Do you breathe low? How do you breathe? As a kind of ritual wherever we teach we start the same way with this. Everybody stand up. I want you to walk around the room - - greet everybody and wish them good luck on the course. Breathe in through the nose ... ... out through the back of the throat. And then in through the back of the throat. Out through the mouth. In through the back of the throat, mouth still open. Now close the mouth and breathe through the back of the throat. Keep your eyes closed, put your palms facing up on your lap. Breathe normally. We're gonna do some yoga stretching while practicing this breathing. Breathe in, hands come up. Exhaling. I don't hear any breaths. One more time. Inhaling. Higher. Higher. Dropping the trunk. The trunk's down. Going from side to side. Heads way forward, looking at your belly button. Another breath in. One more time. Now we're going to watch our breathing. Nice job. Are you ready? - Are your bodies quiet? - Yeah. Alright, so we're gonna count 5 breaths. Are you ready? Breathing in. Breathing out. Breathing in. There, it's on. - Somebody help me. - You're doing great, Will. We have been doing foster care, and we got a call from the county - - to take a newborn baby that was 5 days old - - that needed an emergency placement. So we met Will when he was 5 days old - - and he was in the ICU for another 2 weeks after that - - and then we brought him home. Over the next 2 years Will was placed - - in 4 other placements besides our home, and he was in our home twice. We felt that Will needed to be placed with a permanent family. We looked at our life, and where we were at, and as being older - - we were at a point where we thought he'd be better off long term - - with a younger family. I'm 58, gonna be 59, Sarah's 54, gonna be 55 - - and 3 years ago ... You can figure out the math. And the birth mom was fighting losing Will. And when this happened - - she was sober enough long enough to understand what was happening - - and she came and asked us to adopt Will - - and she was willing to give up her rights, if Sarah and I would adopt him. The thing that really impacted me the most through this whole process - - was when Will was in his last placement before we got him back. We had a chance to go see Will, and Will was 20 months old. We're getting ready to leave, and Will goes and gets his coat - - and wants to come with us, and was upset that he couldn't come with us - - after he hadn't really seen us for 6-8 weeks. And the impact that had on me was just enormous. You look at how traumatic the experience a little kid would have ... ... before 20 months old, to have 4 or 5 different placements - - with different families. When we got Will back, and he struggled ... He lives out loud, he has no filter, he's very spontaneous - - and we met with a number of different doctors to help us ... ... specialists to help us help him. And the thing they talked about early on was they diagnosed him as ADHD. And they wanted to medicate him at 3 years old. That's crazy to us, to give kids these powerful drugs - - to help calm their behaviour - - and we felt that there are other and better ways to deal with that. So, Will, I heard that when you go by elevators - - they get you really, really angry or really upset. Is that true? How does it feel on the inside when that's happening? - Scared. - It feels scared. And where on the inside does it happen? - Right here. - It happens in here? This ... ... is for you. In the class. - How did you put that in there? - You know what? I think next week everyone's gonna make one of these. But I wanted to check it out with you first. Shake it up really hard. Like as if you were really mad or really angry. And watch it settle. Watch those sparkles go down. Watch it very closely. This jar, right now, is like your mind when you're angry and upset. It's bouncing all over the place - - and then we see the angry thoughts settling down, right? - I'm just watching. - Are you watching? It's going down in here. Can you see it? What do you think about that mind jar? Do you think we should leave it at school - - so that if you're feeling angry or upset, you could maybe shake it? I'm gonna go with the bacon and cheddar cheese burger. Everything looks so good, it's hard to make up one's mind. - If the Reuben is good ... - What's a Reuben? It's basically a corned beef sandwich. If you try to hold her hand, she'll probably do something. Nah, I just don't like people behind me. - You're gonna get out? - Actually, the ... No, it's ... I'm just gonna ... No, I'm ... I'll just move. This is okay. - Not a knife, you can have a spoon. - She always gets something sharp. - Spoon! - See, but that's boring. Spoon! I'll put you into the scanner now and tell the scanner where you are. - Hey, can you hear me? - Yes. I can hear you, too. We start off with a short 8-second scan. Hold nice and still. Out of those 24, 10 of them have had some kind of PTSD symptoms. Those who have more severe symptoms are self-medicating - - and doing drugs. They're doing marihuana daily. What about suicidality? Out of the 23 how many reported - - a specific thought about suicide, not death, but suicide? Maybe 4 or 5. Okay, we should review each of their cases now. This is past. He doesn't have ... Yeah. Is this 106? - Has anybody called him? - I'm gonna call him now. In this brain, the area that's shaded in this red colour - - is the amygdala, and this is the hippocampus, just behind it. It's been found in individuals with PTSD - - that the literal size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller - - compared to a normal brain. The hippocampus is really important - - for enabling people to modulate their emotions in a way - - that's appropriate to the situation they're in. The amygdala is the area of the brain that is critical for detecting - - the cues or thread in the first place, and once the cue is detected - - another part of the amygdala unleashes a cascade of responding - - that includes 3 major components. One is a behavioural component, which may be associated - - with freezing or with running away, with fleeing. It could include an autonomic component. That's the second component which would involve changes - - in heart rate and in blood pressure to prepare the organism to act - - and the third component is changes in hormones. The key hormone here is cortisol, which is a stress hormone. In the study that we're currently doing with the veterans - - the training will only last one week. We do not yet know if training this short can actually produce changes - - in the function and the structure of the brain. Who has the young kid? Somebody has a young kid. You wouldn't wanna take your 5-year-old to see The Exorcist, right? - Because? - It would scare the crap out of them. Because they couldn't discern the difference between reality - - and what was on the screen. They don't have that capacity. For a lot of us in this room, the same thing is happening. Something's coming up on the screen and part of the body-mind complex - - can't discern, because it's so overwhelming. Hold up your thumb. Luis, do you have a thumb, or are you your thumb? I have a thumb. There's a difference between you and your thumb. I'll ask you the same question, you have things in your past that you - - struggle to come to grips with. In that moment when they come up - - when they're the most intense, do you have those thoughts - - or are you those thoughts or experiences in that moment? - I feel like I have those thoughts. - But they overwhelm you, right? So in that moment you are them, or they are you. Is that right? To the breath, to the meditation we're going to discern again - - between the experiencer, the process of experience - - and the object of the experience, the experience itself. And delink them so that it loses some of its power to come - - and completely overwhelm you. The first thing is to plug your right nostril ... We're not using the victory breath, just in and out of the left nostril. And plug the left, in and out with the right. Breathe in. Memory reconsolidation is a process by which a memory is brought up - - and the relationship you have to that memory can be changed. One of our hypotheses is that while the body goes into deep state of rest - - through the breathing, a reconsolidation process can happen. When I look back on things, what I remember is looks on people's faces. I'd use people's families against them. You know ... When ... you wait for any signs of weakness to come up. You exploit that. Somebody talks about ... pleads: "Please let me go. My mother's sick. She doesn't have anybody else to take care of her." You turn that around on them. You start giving them hypotheticals. Worst-case scenarios. The things that they're worrying about - - that anybody would worry about. Verbalize it. Make it real for them. What's gonna happen to your wife? What's gonna happen to your son? What's gonna happen to your daughter? Who's gonna take care of them? You're the only one that can feed them. Your wife can't go out and work. Your son's too young to go out and work. How are they gonna get food? Do you have a neighbour that'll take care of them? Who's your neighbour, what's his name? Is he a nice guy? Do you think he'll take care of your wife? What'll happen a few years down the line? What do you think people will think, if I let you go tomorrow? If you really wanna go home, I can drop you off in front of your house. From a Humvee. In a lot of cases that's a death sentence. Am I gonna do it? No, never. Does he know that? Probably not. I don't know how many times I've made somebody soil themselves. And afterwards I'm bragging about it and laughing about it. Maybe if I would have shared things and approached it differently - - and been more open to discussing some of these things - - the direction my wife and I took might have changed. But I don't know. - Where is she now? - She's here in Wisconsin. We've started the separation process. When you got Steve back from the war - - and he'd experienced all these things that you are not a part of - - how did that affect you? Did he talk about it? What he had been through during the deployment? No. And I decided not to ask him until he's ready to talk. It's really bad that you never know what happened to ... ... the closest person next to you. Uhm ... especially with little kids you're always so stressed out - - and I really need his help, but he's not ready for that. He's more like ... really having a problem with his emotions. I think I was less emotionally stable, I would swing. Yeah, yeah. - Did it scare you? - Oh ... yeah. It did. It was really bad. It was a time when I was kinda ... I was alone with myself. I was shoving everything out. I was coming home. I should be happy to be with my wife and kids - - but really I just wanted to be alone. I was mad. I was angry. I was quick-tempered. There were times that I thought Alex was ignoring me - - or not paying attention to me, and I'd reach out and grab her arms - - and just kinda hold her there, so that she would look at me. Afterwards she'd show me - - that just by grabbing a hold of her I had bruised her on the arms. Until we started the process of divorce I would've said I was fine. If you'd asked her, she would've told you I was different when I returned - - and that I never returned the same person. Can you tell me again what happened, if you're ready. Aha. I put sand in Griffin's mouth. So if he's just laying down, doing his own thing - - do you think it's a kind thing to do to put sand in his mouth? - And then you laughed about it. - I wasn't! I guess Will's not ready. You can go play. But I am ready! - I hate you. - I know you're really angry at me. How about if we go inside and use your snow globe to calm down? No! I'm not! I'm not. - What do you want to use? - Nothing. I want to play. I'm gonna come back in 5 minutes, okay? Okay. Every emotion has a corresponding rhythm of the breath. Remember we talked about the guy that got angry ... You could watch him getting angry through the breath. And when we were young these rhythms were natural to us. The breath we're gonna learn today, is designed - - to instil those natural rhythms back. There may be some changes - - in the mind or body during the process of breathing - - and they could be a little diverting. But the key to success is - - whatever is happening to continue to throw it into the breath. How many people are willing to go through the process? Let us take a transition breath in. Breathe in. And let it go. And with victory breath, breathe in, two, three, four. Hold, two, three, four. Breathe out, two, three, four. Breathe in. Hold. Breathe out. Hold. Breathe in. Hold. So, what was it like? Anybody speak. Rich? I kept up with the breathing okay, but towards the end of it - - my arms and hands started to cramp up. And as soon as I laid down, I just got hit by a ton of guilt, actually. I flashed back to two people I felt responsible for that had gotten killed. I kept seeing faces go by my eyes, and it's ... - Faces from your past? - Yeah. And the thoughts of those people are still kinda with me. I don't know if people heard it, but I laughed, trying to cover up a cry. I was thinking about a translator that I made good friends with over there. When we left they ... they ... you know. Sent his head to his family and stuff like that. I didn't like it at all, actually. I liked the fast breathing. It gave me something to do. But the whole sitting around thing, I progressively liked it less and less. I'm used to being really busy all the time, so I can't think about stuff - - and now it's making me think about stuff that I don't like doing. The breathing allows the trauma to be released - - so it's not like you're experiencing these feelings for no reason. I will be calling you this afternoon, checking in and saying hello. Is that okay with everybody? Ryan? It's okay? So, will you make sure you answer or call me back? "Chester loved the kiss. Now he knew his mother's love would go with him - - wherever he went, even to school." You see that there's an empty seat over there. Ryan isn't with us today. He called last night, and he said: "This stuff coming up in me, I'm not sure I'm ready to deal with it." We told him a lot of things. And maybe some of you are - - experiencing stuff you weren't sure you'd be dealing with at this point. He's welcome here. We hope he finds a way to complete his mission - - but we didn't want you to wonder why he's not here. I kinda thought I was ready to talk about some stuff in my past - - and the deep breathing and the yoga and all that kinda stuff - - made it a little more difficult than I had anticipated. I'm used to having my mind occupied with school, working out, training - - work, whatever. I'm used to always being busy. I think I'm doing a lot better than some I know that got back. My working out, my going to an extreme level of fitness - - is equivalent to them going out and drinking or doing drugs. That's their way of dealing with it. I chose this, and they chose that. Everybody has their own method of doing it, but ... ... personally I think this is better. My colleagues were, for the most part, extremely sceptical. They made it clear that if I wanted a successful career in science - - this was not a good way for me to begin it. So I stopped doing meditation research. There are very few people that knew I was a meditator. I was a closet meditator, and of course all that changed - - in 1992 when I met the Dalai Lama. He said to me: "We've been using tools of modern neuroscience - - to study qualities like fear and anxiety and depression. Why can't we use those same tools to study kindness and compassion?" One. Two. Keep going. What do plants and bulbs need to grow? - Sun and water. - Sun is one thing. - Water is another thing. - Soil! Love! - Do you know why? - Because ... Because if you don't love it, it won't grow. That's right if you don't care for things, will they grow? - No. - First, put in the bulbs. Then put dirt on top of them. Can everybody use these cups at the same time. There are only 2. Wait. - I need dirt. - That was mine! Give it to me! What happened, buddy? What happened, honey? He snatched that bucket from me. - I got it first. - No, you didn't. Excuse me, I would like you both to talk with me for a second. Does it feel tight in here? Show me with your hand - - how it feels inside. Where does it feel tight? Right there? And in your throat. Okay, watch me. Put your hand on your belly - - and take in a breath with me. Blow it out. And breathe in. And breathe out. This is what I would like you to do. How does it feel in there now, does it still feel tight? - As tight or less tight? - Less ... Good, so here's my question. I would like you to ask him: - "Tell me why you're sad." - Tell me why you're sad. Because you snatched that from me. So, what did he say? - I snatched it from him. - And how does he look right now? - Sad. - Very, very sad. - But I only ... - But wait a second. Now I want you to tell him how you're feeling. Can you listen to him when he talks? Alright. Tell him how you're feeling when you see him so sad. - Sad. - You feel sad, too. Show me where in your body, you feel sad. - Right here. - You feel sad in your body. It doesn't feel good, does it? What might you do to help him feel better? - Sorry. - You can say you're sorry. What else can you do to help him feel a little bit better? Oh, that would be nice. How do you feel on the inside? - Good. - Do you feel good or tight and sad? Good. True confessions, how many people were able to do their homework? Good. And how many people didn't find time? I'm wondering, have you guys practiced - - with belly buddies in a while? Spread out, you can come off your matt, 'cause I wanna practice. Continual practice is something very important - - and it's kind of like physical exercise. You don't go to a spa for 10 days and exercise and think - - that the benefits will last for the remainder of your life - - if you don't continue to practice, and meditation is very similar. Feel that rock going up and down. Breathing in. The brain of an accomplished meditator who is very happy - - has a number of important characteristics - - which are different from the brain of an untrained person. One is at the area in the front part of the brain - - which is what we call the prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is very important for regulation of emotion - - and regulation of attention, and one of the things we find is that - - in long-term meditation practitioners there is increased activation - - in this area. They become more pronounced during meditation - - but they're also more pronounced just in the ordinary baseline state. Meditation in addition to affecting the mind and the brain - - it also affects our body. One of the things we've studied is the immune system - - and one of the ways we've studied it is by looking at a person's response - - to a flu vaccine, and one remarkable finding indicates - - that people who are taught meditation and are meditating - - for the first time and go through 2 months of meditation - - actually show an enhanced response to the flu vaccine - - compared to untrained controls. And we just don't know how that actually comes about. Is it literally growing new neurons - - in specific areas that contribute to this? Is it a strengthening of new connections? Is it pruning connections that may have been causing a lot of noise - - and disruption, like a sculptor who takes a block of marble - - and creates something beautiful by removing components - - not adding anything? We don't know what the mechanism is. It could be any one - - of those mechanisms, or it could be all of them. If there was one or two things about myself - - at this point in my life that I'd like to get in touch with again - - what would they be? When I was a little kid, people used to always comment on - - how I smiled all the time, and I don't do that anymore. When I look at my kids, they have that innocence and naiveté - - but I've grown cynical and closed off. I thought about it a lot. Then the realization set in - - that maybe I haven't really lived since I've been back. I've been just kinda ... here. Jason? It would be a kind of innocence. Just being able to ... let go. Just be in the moment. There is a place inside you where that reality still exists. The question is: Can we find our way back there? "Sleep safe, little bear, curled up with your brother and your mother - - in the cave. Sleep safe. Sleep safe, little penguin under daddy's feathers. All warm in your ice-cold world. Sleep safe." The elevator is kinda far away, isn't it? We're getting close to the elevator, how does it feel in your body? - It feels good. - It does? Okay, let's go over. Alright, let's see what happens when the doors open. Do you wanna stand in here and see how it feels in your belly? - How does it feel in your belly? - Good. It does? Are you sure? Do you want the doors to close or not? Not. So, Will, I'm wondering. Maybe another day - - could we take that mind jar with us and take a ride on the elevator? Another day, or today? Uhm ... another day. We'll begin our going-home program with Ujai breath. Eyes closed. Normal breath in. And out. Elbows to the sky. Palms on the shoulder blade - - biceps by the ears. Hold, two and relax. So, have you noticed any difference? Yeah, he's answering the questions much more positively. He expresses much less anxiety and much more optimism - - than at the first time. I came to the realization that for the last 3 years I have not really lived. Instead, I have lived for my wife - - and may have contributed significantly to our problems. It has changed my life in ways I never thought possible. I feel happy: Like a kid again. Coming into the course, I wasn't feeling really good about myself - - and the things I'd done. It actually happened last night. For the first time I could look at stuff and not really feel anything about it. Just look at it, and just know that it happened. So many little things, just the fact that - - I've been able to sleep on my own without having to take Ambien - - for almost a whole week is amazing. Live, guys. Just live. Give yourself permission to smile again This poem was written by Derek Walcott: 'Love After Love'. The time will come when with elation you will greet yourself arriving at your own door in your own mirror and each will smile at the other's welcome and say: Sit here, eat you will love again the stranger who was yourself give wine, give bread give back your heart to itself to the stranger who's loved you all your life whom you ignored for another, who knows you by heart take down the love letters from the bookshelf the photographs the desperate notes peel your image from the mirror sit feast on your life Can I hold your hand in the elevator? - Of course you can. - I'm a little bit scared. And remember, what does the snow globe do for you? - Make me calm. - Yeah. Are you ready? Now remember when you watch up there - - it's gonna tell you which floors. If you feel worried what can you do with the snow globe? Shake it. Okay, watch this. How does your mind and body feel right now? - Calm. - Good. - Is this a funny place? - Yeah. Look, does it match? The six and the six. Wanna look out the window real quick? - Let me see. - Is it raining? He did it! What do we say? Good job! Yay! - What floor did you go to? - Six! It's actually a good thing to do to pick this up occasionally - - and to remind ourselves - - that this is the most complicated organ in the universe. We've only taken the first very, very small baby step. We're just beginning this journey. Subtitles: Tina Goldberg Dansk Video Tekst
