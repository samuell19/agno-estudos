I can't believe Alberto Yousseffound out. Worst thing is to think of him Iaughing at us. It'd be much worse ifallofthem found out. Well, if we've got a Ieak, it didn't reach Chater. - Things are pretty normal. - They're calling. - Okay, I'II call you back. - Ivan? I'm off to Sáo Luís. You guys find him? - We can't zero in any further. - He's in the Lighthouse District, but we can't Iocate the hotel. We have a plainclothes team, so they can,t be identified. - Got it. I need a team at each hotel. - Let me call the Director General. - Hold on, I know Sáo Luís. Ivan, AIberto Youssef. There are only 3 hotels where he would be. Edu, Iet me see the hotels. Try this one. Luzeiros Hotel, good evening. Is Mr. AIberto Youssef registered? Hold on please. Hello. - Goddamn it! - Hello? - That was him. - Why'd they put me through? I just wanted to know if he was there, damn it! It's okay, Julio. No way he'II know who called. So? He'II know something's wrong. This operation's dead! Let's go! - He's not moving. - Julio, update the address. Because this piece of shit isn't going anywhere. - Yes? - I'm sending the location. Great, thanks. POLICE CHIEF, CHANGE OF ADDRESS SEARCH AND SEIZURE THIRTEENTH FEDERAL COURT - JUDGE SERGIO MORO CHANGE OF ADDRESS GRANTED Relax, Youssef. Your ride is on the way. Relax my ass! Someone calls the hotel, asks for me by name. And when I answer, they hang up? I know what's going on! Call the guy and see where he is! You can't trust politicians. Get rid of the car! I don't want to draw attention! - Six-one-six? - That's right. Come on, pick up the phone. Six-one-six... Go ahead, you first. Get in. Okay, your ride is here. - You know what to do with this. - Don't worry. Shit! Ivan, he was here and now he's gone. Goddamn it! OPERATION CAR WASH A WORLDWIDE SCANDAL MADE IN BRAZIL Naturally, our story doesn't begin here. Like smallpox and tuberculosis, corruption came to Brazil on the first sailboats. From the very beginning, Portugalsent Brazil a governor already convicted ofembezzlement In 1650, FatherAntonio Vieira said, "The Portuguese do not want our good. They want our goods." Brazilwood, slaves, gold, land, diamonds, taxes, iron, coffee... Everything and everyone was robbed or stolen. From Viscount ofMaua's telegraphic submarine cable to Vargas'sea ofmud. An endless sea ofcorruption. Cassava, BNH, Sociallnsurance, "Parabolica''... I don't have any scruples. Be aware ofthat.? SUDAM, SUDENE, Anaconda... $30,000 is a lot ofmoney. "Propinoduto'', Bingo, Elba Fiat... I vote for dignity! Yes! Budget "dwarves'', Bloodsuckers, Allowances, Dominoes, NGOs... Cash in underwear and even the Whistle. Banestado, where we met, a dead-end case that dismantled our team. Beacon Hill, Sand Castle, Jackal, Satyagraha, "Mensalinho'', Minas "Mensalao'', and the biggest ofall. A sophisticated criminal organization, divided into areas of activity, and professionally structured to commit crimes such as embezzlement, money Iaundering, active corruption, fraudulent management and many other types of fraud. The main culprit in ofall this? The pen. For as long as someone gets to hold the pen, there will be corruption. Power always rests with those who appoint. Those who sign the dotted line. For bad or for good. You won't regret this. We're going to rebuild Curitiba. Look, Boss. It's only because of you guys. Do you know who you want to head the Financial Crimes unit? It's going to require hard work, so we need someone Ievel-headed. What's wrong with you? Can't you count to 1 5? You had 1 5 days to conclude the investigation and you're behind schedule? How could you? - Can I say something? - PIease don't. Don't even try. There's no explanation. An important case, and my prisoner is on the Ioose free to intimidate witnesses, destroy evidences, and interfere with proceedings because you failed to meet your fucking deadline! Unbelievable. Thanks, Ivan. But don't waste time on me. I accepted their invitation, and I'm going to Sao Paulo. The Brazilian financial center, you know. Just think about it. You don't have to say no yet. There's nothing to think about. I don't want to put myself through it again. We arrest, they release. And our case is closed due to red tape or a change in who's in power. I don't want that anymore! I see, Bia. But it's different now. We're forming a very reliable team. Director General Rodrigo, Antenor, and me. So you think it's going to be totally different this time. Well, no. We won't become England overnight. - So, why did you say yes? - We're not gonna change Brazil, but there's always something we can do, right? And that's why we need our "generala". - Our "generala"? - Yeah, to organize the troops. - Are you calling me bossy? - Ma'am, no, Ma'am! I am not a "generala". That word doesn't even exist. Ma'am, yes, Ma'am. There's gotta be thousands of cases that haven't moved since I Ieft. Who's going to clean it all up? On one condition. Do you really think you can control him? "Control" is a strong word, but... Julio's the only one who can put this in order. Besides, Bia will only accept our offer if she can bring him. I'II see you Iater. BRAZILIAN FEDERAL POLICE BUREAU I told Ivan that Julio's the only guy who can clean this mess. Actually, she said "Julio, the Nutcase". Oh, yeah. Julio, the Nutcase, sorry. - I had to get back. - Now, Julio. How's your mother? - She starts chemo on Thursday. - If you need time to adjust... These cases have been here for years. - No, I need to work. - Whoa! How did you wind up in this dump? I'm glad you're here. Jesus... We must be masochists, Julio. We pound the pavement, until we're beat, and we end up back to where we started. Do you ever wonder why we do this? - Endorphins? - I didn't mean jogging, Julio. I know. For me, endorphins come from eating well, traveling... and from when we arrest one of those assholes. For me, it's from working with you. Hey come back here! WASHINGTON LUIZ HIGHWAY - Copy that. TR-01 , do you copy? - Copy. Let him stay put. I'm almost there! Zero One copy, moving in. BTR-02, affirmative. Chopper, turn around! Right in front ofyou. Careful, suspect is armed. Our story only exists because a truck loaded with hearts ofpalm led us to a drug dealer who laundered his money with a guy who owned a gas station that Julio was investigating. The gas station money launderer led us to another launderer, who was a lover and an associate ofNelma Kodama, aka Grand Dame ofthe Currency Exchange. Nelma was also a lover and associate ofAlberto Youssef, the biggest black-market money man in Brazil. I'II bring your present. Youssefhad been arrested once, but was released because ofa plea bargain, where he agreed to become state's witness and in which he only snitched on his competitors. If you need my help, we're friends. I can give you all their names. I overturn Alberto Youssef's sentence on the condition that he never again works as a black-market trader, whether in the formal or informalmarket. ARANA FEDERAL UNIVERSITY INTERNATIONA LAW, PROF. JUDGE SÉRGIO MORO Gradually, people Iost interest in the proceedings, for their own Iives started being affected. This, in turn, made Operation CIean Hands investigators Iose public support. Next class, I want an essay explaining how the Iaws that were passed by the Italian Parliament made it impossible for the Prosecutors to do their job. Good day, everyone. Thank you. What's so urgent you guys had to come here to talk to me? We need a wiretap on AIberto Youssef. Youssef? Why? Is he in breach of his agreement? With his same old scam. He must think we're idiots. Send me the case files. I'II analyze them. Your Honor, it's clean cut. We have invoices, deposits... Like I said, send me the files. I'II take a Iook at them and say yes or no. Thank you, Commissioners. What should I call it? I don't know, Bia. He's Iinked to money Iaundering, owns a gas station... We had no clue that we had started the largest anti-corruption operation in Brazil's history. CAR WASH Among millions ofblue folders, Julio, the Nutcase, discovered a black market network with traffickers and smugglers. This is it. You guys thought we'd get nowhere? We have fucking Youssef again. When the operation was almost ready, we got a Christmas present. CHRISTMAS, 201 3 Marcos, come over here. Let me get this, honey. - Where's Julio? - I'II go get him. - Let me help you. - AIright. PLEASE FIND CAR PHOTOS NEW CAR DEALER INVOICE TO PAULO ROBERTO COSTA Did you win the Iottery? Are you buying this fancy car? On a Federal Police paycheck? Dream on. I thought it was my Christmas gift. I should get you broadband for Christmas. - Or is it too fancy for you? - It's the way we Iike it. We come here to talk to each other. You guys ever heard of a Paulo Roberto Costa? - Ítalo? - Ítalo will coordinate the task force from The Public Prosecutor's Office. - Pedro Henrique... - I'm the voice of experience. Well, Happy New Year. - Did you ever hear of him? - Go ahead, tell us. - Check this out. - What's going on? I found an invoice for a Land Rover paid for by Youssef but the car's registered to Paulo Roberto Costa. He used to be a Petrobras Director, and now he owns a consulting firm. Hey check out this Land Rover. It was a present. I never got a present Iike this. It comes with a DVD player, Ieather seats and a Search Warrant. The operation was complete. With 81 Warrants for Search and Seizures 18 Preventive Arrests, ten Temporary Custody and 19 detentions for questioning. KICKOFF NIGHT OF STAGE 1 1 7 MARCH, 201 4 Something had to go wrong. Youssef's number appeared in Sáo Luís. - What do you mean, Sao Luís? - Maranháo, Julio. He's gone. Shit! Ivan, we Iost him. He was here and now he's gone. - Goddamn it! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Relax! We're gonna catch him. What do we do now? - What do you mean? We find him! Listen, I know everyone's upset, but he's gone! I understand, butyou know he's the linchpin... We have to catch him. You hear me? - Stop right there! - Talk to me. What's going on there? Stop, motherfucker! Shit. - To the airport, now. - Stop! Don't move! Okay, pal. Just don't kill me. Federal Police. You're under arrest. Fuck yeah! At Iast. Jeez! The operation was saved. After 10 years, he was back in our hands. Ivan! You really packed on the pounds! Used to be a Iadies' man, now you Iook Iike Marlon Brando. - See? Six pack. - Youssef... Let's go. The money launderers were injail, but we had no idea the best was yet to come. - Yes, Rico? - That man from Petrobras. Someone went into his office and made offwith a lot ofstuff. - What? How? - We made a mistake. While we were searching the house, his daughter and son-in-Iaw came here and cleaned up. Can you prove it was his family? Can I prove it? We found US$500 thousand at the house. And now the family makes off with the documents. No way! "They must think we're idiots." STAGE 2 PAULO ROBERTO COSTA'S PLACE You've got to be kidding me! Second time three days! Okay, I've got it. You searched my daughters' house too? - Why? What for? - You know why, Ma'am. My Iawyer wants to know if you guys have an arrest warrant. - No, wait, calm down! - Sit down, Mrs. Costa. - Am I going to jail, too? - No, Ma'am. You're not. You guys don't know who you're messing with. Commissioner, just a few words please? Will Youssef's arrest annul his plea bargain -regarding the Banestado Case? - That's up to the courts, but we believe he's violated the terms of the agreement. I'm Juliana, Reporter at 720 Degrees blog. Would you Iike to comment on the arrest of Paulo Roberto Costa, the Petrobras Time-Bomb? I don't know anything about a Time-Bomb. What about the involvement of members of congress? Their cases go directly to the Supreme Court. "Officeholder's Privileged Jurisdiction". Mr. Commissioner, please! SYSTEM ACCESS FEDERAL POLICE Petrobras Time-Bomb... OPERATION CAR-WASH DOCUMENTS MO CONSULTANCY SERVICES REVENUES FROM CONTRACTOR GROUP CAMARGO CORREA Camargo Corréa got an overpriced contract with Petrobras to build a refinery. They then made transfers to Youssef's business accounts. The money from Youssef's accounts paid Paulo Roberto Costa's companies. Cash smuggling, corruption, kickback, racketeering... Paulo Roberto Costa's companies use Youssef's to send money overseas. Money Smuggling. - That's a Iot of money. - Wait a minute, Julio. You're saying that Costa signs Petrobras' contract with the construction company. The company pays Youssef. Youssef pays Costa, who takes the opportunity to send money abroad? Just Iike that? Julio, this is way bigger than the money Iaunderers. I asked the Federal Auditors Office to Iook into this contract. The refinery cost five times the estimated value. That's our evidence, Ivan. One of Brazil's Iargest contractors is corrupting Petrobras. These guys are so arrogant, they didn't even try to hide it. What if Paulo Roberto Costa spills the beans? What do you have in mind? PIea bargain? We could build a case using only the documents. But he can give us everything. Banks, accounts, people... I have nothing to say. We're just trying to understand the quid pro quo. I'm innocent. You are a bunch of torturers who think the Dictatorship is back. I have absolutely nothing to say. JUSTICE ORDERS RELEASE OF PERSONS IN CUSTODY AND CLAIMS THE CASE SHOULD GO TO THE SUPREME COURT - Release all of them? - AII of them, every single one. Mr. Paulo Costa filed a writ of habeas corpus, invoking "Officeholder Jurisdiction" and they all followed suit. - Chater, Youssef... - But how did he get it? Is he a member of Congress? A Senator? I thought only Cabinet members, Senators and Presidents had "Officeholder Jurisdiction". Has the Iaw changed overnight? He argued that because there are Congressmen involved the whole case must go to the Supreme Court. If this case goes Supreme Court, it dies, we're screwed. Case closed. - The system is built to fail. - So, what do we do, Ivan? The Supreme Court has spoken, Judge Moro will sign the release forms, and we'II have to obey. But, Dad, everybody's staying until 2 a.m. Why do I need to get home by midnight? Think of it Iike this: I'm the Iower court. Your mother is the superior court. I could never revert your mother's decision. Seriously, you always make the same joke. - Because it's a good one. - Talk to her. PIease. You know if I Ieave early I've got no chance with Priscilla. You wanna stay until 2? Okay. Now... shall we? - Wait for me in the car. - Say goodbye to your dad. - See ya! - Oh, Honey. Do you know how you're going to respond? POLICE INVESTIGATION FEDERAL PROSECUTION SERVICES Letting them all walk free would,ve been a disaster. And that,s when thejudge saved the operation. Actually, thejudge, and the truck fullofhearts ofpalm. Very politely, he reminded the Supreme Courtjustices that letting everybody walk would free money launderers and an international drug dealer. Allofthem, flight risks. Operation Car Wash includes a criminalindictment based upon the apprehension of 1,500 lbs ofcocaine. I hereby callforyour guidance on the extent ofyour decision. The Supreme court reconsidered and the others remained behind bars. But Paulo Roberto Costa was freed. - Your comments please? What they're doing is absurd. This is torture. - Now I need to clear my name. - Is anyone else involved? This whole thing sucks! What we do is useless! That's the way things go in this damn country! It always has, and always will be Iike this when you mess with someone at the top! You really think a mere Director at Petrobras -calls the shots? - If there's a turtle up a tree... someone had to put it there. Wanna get to the criminal? Follow the money. Wanna get to the big boss? Follow the pen! I found the money and I found the pen. It signed his release papers. Come on, Bia, don't say that. You can't give up now. You're the only hope we've got. -Don't be silly. - Think of the advantages. You could visit me someplace exotic. First of all, Oxford and Stanford are not exotic places. PIus, if you're counting on me to calm you down, forget it. - How's your mother doing? - Hanging in there. - Coming here helped a Iot. - Willyou be back tomorrow? - Julio, are you there? - I'II have to call you back. The Pasadena refinery Petrobras is not a criminalcorporation, and it does not employ crooks. It's important to clarify that Petrobras isn,t a storefront for corruption! Son of a bitch! Hey, Julio. - What 's wrong, son? - I feel Iike I'm punching a wall. We arrest they acquit... You know what? I'm going to finish my PhD, spend more time with mom... This whole thing is draining, you know? Keep punching. It'II collapse sooner or Iater. - Hey what've you got there? - Busted! Just one. PAULO ROBERTO COSTA'S COUNTRY HOME, ITAIPAVA A FEW DAYS LATER If he hid something, it has to be here. We dug through everything and found nothing. What makes you think there's anything here? I just know, Bia. There's got to be something. If your instinct says so... okay, we'II keep Iooking. I could even call other detectives to help. I don't think we need them. There's only one thing I'd Iike to confirm, Mrs... - Joana. - Are you sure you haven't seen anything unusual around here? You can tell us. I guarantee nothing bad will happen to you. We were told they brought documents to hide here. No one hid anything here, Sir. Mrs. Costa burned them in the barbecue grill. Same as always. While we searched for the pens, we followed the money. That bank account Julio discovered, took us from Costa,s country house to Switzerland. SWISS PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE BERN, SWITZERLAND I'II be right back. Hello. - We have it all, Julio. - AII what"? Everything. Costa's accounts, his family's accounts and his business accounts in Switzerland, we got it all. -$23 million USD! -23 million dollars? I hearyou, Bia. Have a good trip. Hey, Buddy! Joining us for the World Cup? Did you bring the cards? Come on, come on! Fingers crossed. We can still win this match! Come on, Paulo! We can do it! No giving up! GERMANY 6 x BRAZIL 0. I am a proud Brazilian and I love my country Be strong, Paulo. Chin up, okay? Mom, Iet me talk to him. Dad, you gotta do what's best for us. For allofus. Yo, Paulo! You're a celebrity! You're on TV again! The FederalPolice carried out search and seizure warrants at 10 companies connected to Petrobras' ex-Director Paulo Costa and his family. This is Stage 6 of Operation Car Wash, conducted by the FederalPolice , investigating the misappropriation ofover 10 billion dollars, managed by Paulo Costa and Alberto Youssef. Mom, Joao and I are going to jail, Dad. I can't go to jail. I can't do it. You have to fix this. - Hm-hm. RECORDING My family walks away scott free? That's right. And you'II be under house arrest. - Where should I start? - From the beginning. AIright, you must understand that Brazil's been corrupt from the beginning. When John VI of Portugal transferred the court to Brazil, he stayed with the slave merchants. The slave merchants controlled public Iife. They did whatever they wanted to the Monarchy. Can we cut the crap? No one's here for a History Iesson. Anyway, my point being... The slave merchants of Brazil today are the giant contractors. Listen carefully. Few companies can handle jobs of the size Petrobras needs. Refineries, oil rigs, power plants. Just a handful of companies. And they all banded together to decide which contractor is gonna be awarded which job. So what is it? A Cartel! They would overcharge each job by 1 5 to 20 percent. Hundreds of millions of dollars per job. Paulo Roberto talked about everything. A "club'' of 11 companies organized like a soccer league. And with regulations. They would pay bribes to Youssef (Worker's Party), Fernando Baiano (Democratic Movement Party), and Vaccari (Worker's Party). Who in turn would pay off, Each of us director depending on who signed contract. - How much was the pay off? - About three percent. Petrobras directors, appointed by politicians, received kickbacks in exchange for approvingjobs. So, three percent above the budget were distributed among public officials, correct? - Correct. - And Petrobras directors received a percentage of that, too. At the Services Division, out of the three percent paid off, two percent went to the Worker's Party (PT). So the Workers' Party was paid off at Exploration and Production Division, at Gas and Energy Division, and at the Services Division. The International Division director was appointed by the Democratic Movement Party. Therefore, the Democratic Movement got a slice of the money, and the Progressive Party got its part as well. Each division diverted funds to the political parties and these parties appointed the directors - Guys, that was incredible! - For the first time, we have someone tell us every detail. Aren't you excited about it, Ivan? Yeah, it's starting to get interesting. Starting? You're a piece of work. - Commissioner! - Could you please Iet us know which names Paulo Costa mentioned in his plea bargain? EIected officials, are under Supreme Court jurisdiction, and the details of the plea bargain only when the court unseals the record. Are there many politicians involved? We're Ieaving for Iunch. We'II talk when we get back. Commissioner, why are you trying to destroy the Workers party? - What? - With only a month before the presidential elections, don't you think it's an abuse of power to try and influence the outcome? Juliana, we're not investigating a party. We're investigating facts, not people. So you're saying that, coincidently, all this just happened to come to Iight just before the elections. Seriously? Yes, that's how it happened. So that's what I'm saying. You have no right to influence an election! We couldn't run away from the facts. Ifwe went too fast, they would say we were favoring PSDB. Ifwe went too slowly, they'd say we were favoring PT. It's only political, because politicians are doing the stealing! They wouldn't have to go to jail if they stopped stealing money. How many of these cases were not annulled, Julio? The guy spilled the beans! Accounts, documents... We have all evidences! Ivan, for Christ's sake! We can't use anything that Costa said. - What do you mean? - Ivan's right. We have to wait until the Supreme Court approves the plea bargain. Besides what Costa told us, Who are we ready to move on? Seven contractors their owners, and top executives, AII of them, except for the Iargest Andrade Gutierrez and Odebrecht. Their scheme is more complex. Everything is hidden overseas. Guys, fuck the contractors. Who's the big boss? Who put the turtle up the tree? Brazilians went to bed with Rousseff's reelection. Ten days later, they would wake us up. As you all know, today the Federal Police Iaunches Stage 7 of Operation Car Wash, in conjunction with the Federal Prosecutors Office and the IRS. More details will be given now by the coordinator of the operation, Commissioner Ivan Romano. Good morning. I'm going to give you some very interesting figures. We had 300 agents in today's operation and 50 IRS officials. Eighty-five Court orders, six preventive detentions, and 21 temporary detentions. 9 detentions for questioning and 49 seizure and search warrants. We went to the largest contractors in Brazil and took allofthem by surprise. Executives based in Rio de Janeiro were arrested in Sáo Paulo, and executives from Sáo Paulo were arrested in Rio. A few executives tried to hide. Others tried to escape. And some ofthem came in their ownjets to turn themselves in. How can they do that, huh? What kind of country is this? We,d gone where no one ever went before We're talking about seven companies that with Petrobras alone, manage contracts of about R$ 59 billion, (USD 1 9 Billion) which are being investigated by the - IRS and by the Federal Prosecutor's Office. - PIease Mr. Romano. - Did you say R$ 59 million (USD 1 9 million)? - No, I said billion. - Commissioner, "M" or "B"? - B, I said billion. Could you please...? You're not in a position to demand. - I cannot demand? - No, you cannot demand! - What the hell's going on here? - Every attorney brought treats. French bottled mineral water. Belgian chocolate, cheese, -apricot jam, white wine... - No, you Iisten to me! My client has rights! And this arrest is absurd! Absurd is what you guys are doing! - This is not your home! - Mr. Commissioner, please. My client cannot accept this situation. - None of them!! - PIease calm down! I'II see that they each will get a blanket, a pillow and sheets. - And that's all? - What's your name, Counsellor? - Counsellor Carmen. - PIus cookies. - Now get this out of here. Excuse me. - What do we do with all this? Call Charity Services. They'II Iove it. - You got to be kidding me. - You don't find this amusing? The heads of these companies should represente the best of Brazil. There's nothing amusing about it. HOLDING CELLS NO ELECTRONIC DEVICES ALLOWED For the first time, we saw the high and mighty, people who thought themselves untouchable, paying for their crimes. Welcome. Room number 1 54 is vacant. Poker game after Iunch, okay? We knew it wouldn't end there. Months later we would discover that one day after the arrests, people were trying to shut the operation. People inside the FederalPolice, who had worked with us foryears, tryied to frame us with false documents and allegations. The same old strategy. Ifyou can't attack the evidence, attack the investigation. Who, exactly, knew what was going on? The Presidency. The Presidency knew everything. Previously, we had come close to the top. But now, hundreds ofterabytes ofinformation led us to increasingly strong clues. - Check this out. So weird. - What is? He travels to the Dominican Republic to deliver a speech. The Dominican Republic hires Odebrecht for a project, and the Brazilian Government Development Bank subsidizes the construction. Then he travels to Angola. Angola hires Odebrecht to construct a power plant. And the Development Bank also subsidizes the construction. Then in Cuba... Same thing in Cuba. These guys don't hand out receipts for kickbacks. - What concrete evidence do you actually have? - We have money sent to his Institute. Directors from the Institute dealing with the contractors. But can you connect them directly to the trips? Directly, not yet, but we're connecting the dots. There's US$200 million the Petrobras manager Sent to the Worker's Party. - But that was to the Party Treasurer. - Yeah, I know. But we're getting closer to the Big Boss. Are we sure it's him? - Of course! Who else would it be? - I don't know. Until we can prove it, We don't know anything. The only thing we knew for sure was that Odebrecht, the Iargest of all constructors was the crownjewel. And Marcelo Odebrecht was the prince among the contractors. A man prepared since childhood to be the king ofBrazil. The man who could tell us who could put the turtle up the tree. Their system was impossible to understand. Companies within shellcompanies that owned other shellcompanies within other companies. But now we had an army to crack their system. Can you explain the meeting? I met Freiburghous and AIexandrino to handle the Braskem contract. Alexandrino was Odebrecht's Director oflnstitutionalAffairs, and Braskem was the petrochemicalarm. He'd send AIexandrino the accounts-numbers guy. And AIexandrino took care of the money distribution. - You mean the kickback money. - That's right, the kickback money. - So there was a cartel? - Yes, there was a cartel. Odebrecht was right in the middle of it. Were you aware that Odebrecht was the head of the cartel? Odebrecht? Absolutely. Youssef tried to intimidate me, not to even submit a bid for a public contract because it was earmarked for Odebrecht. SWISS PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE Documents, text messages, balance sheets, shellcompanies, accounts numbers... Everything we needed to get the "prince''. The name ofthe operation alluded to the fact... STAGE 1 4-"ERGA OMNES" that no one is above the Law. Good morning. We have a search warrant. Do you really need weapons? My kids are home. Hold this please. Look into this cabinet. Careful with my furniture, and my rugs too. - I built this place. - It's a beautiful home. - Stay here. I'II tell my wife. - Perhaps you don't get it, but we have a search warrant. We want everyone in the Iiving room, and you're not going anywhere without one of us. - Got it. - Hand me your phone please. - It's not here. I'II get it. - I'II go with you. Search everything. Living room, kitchen, bedrooms, cabinets... -Look for false bottoms. - Got it. Cellphones? It's not here. Hold on a second, I'II check my bedroom. I'II come along. Stay here. My wife is asleep. I'm coming along Iike I said. - What's up, honey? - Nothing. Just the visitors we were expecting. It might be in the bathroom. - What's the pin code? -9-7-5-3. Appreciate that. Honey, put this on. What? It's only a Search and Seizure, right? No, there's this arrest warrant, too. - Honey... - Don't worry. Turn right when you Ieave the condo. Then go inside before reaching the edge. What? It's faster. Now crouch and cough. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FEDERAL POLICE BUREAU So... you ran out ofjokes? One of the thieves, a Director at Petrobras, was outraged when he was arrested, "What kind of country is this?" This song is a tribute to us, always acting Iike fools. "We'' don,t know how to choose ourpresidents "We'' can't even take care ofourselves - Give me a beer please. - A toast to Julio! Useles. We allare useless - To Julio! - To Julio! Commissioner Ivan Romero! Look at you... We have the right to celebrate a small victory. With a nice cold one! I never knew he had a fun side. Julio! We have to admit, things are changing. Not necessarily changing, but we're doing the right thing. Besides, we're Iucky. We're all on the same page. We managed to retrieve a Iot of money, but... - No more buts, Ivan. That's it. - You mean the money? Think someone will have the guts to annul this and return the stolen money to the thieves? - Come on, Ivan! - Cheers. OPERATION CAR WASH STAGE 1 4-"ERGA OMNES" MARCELO ODEBRECHT'S HOME PENDING CONGRETIONAL INVESTIGATIONS, PLEA BARGAIN Wipe memory - phones; Leak campaign donations; Create press release; What about LULA? What about CUNHA? SAIU Of course, we still have a Iong way to go. But as the great Lao Tzu said... A Iong journey begins with a single step. - Hope he was right. To Lao Tzu. - To Lao Tzu. What's going on there? Is that Edu? PIease excuse me. - What's going on here? - Take a Iook at this. From Odebrecht's cell phone. CANCEL MEETING AND RESCHEDULE TO THE SUPREME COURT Now check this out. From Odebrecht's hard drive. This spreadsheet. "The Italian". This is Palocci, Lula's Finance Minister. Now, Iook at this email. LILS is Lula's Speeches and Events company - that's how he's paid for his speeches. Whereas LI stands for Lula Institute. Both are being paid by Odebrecht. So, should we notify the Supreme Court? No. He's no Ionger an elected official. He doesn't get officeholder jurisdiction. - There's no reason to notify anyone. - But he's the former president. He Ieft office with 70, 80 percent approval. I know we still have a Iot of research to do. But I Iooked into the payments received, the speeches, the construction projects... and I realized that more than half the money, R$ 30 million that went to his Speeches and Events company, and to the Lula Institute, came from these 5 contractors. Is this evidence enough? Or do you think it's just coincidence? In Angola, Lula gave a speech paid for by Odebrecht, who built a hydroelectric plant worth R$ 1.5 billion, (USD 500 Million) and financed by the Government Development Bank. He gave a speech in Cuba, also paid by Odebrecht, who also built a port in Mariel, financed by the Development Bank. Lula flies to the Dominican Republic Odebrechtpays. Six months later, The Development Bank finances. Argentina, Peru, Ghana... Always the same. Speeches-Odebrecht-Development Bank. But there was more. The formerpresident took items from the Palace to a warehouse, costing millions ofdollars. The bill was paid by the contractor OAS. There was a triplex in the Solaris Condominium, built by Bancoop, Bankers Building Cooperative, in Guarujá,, and also paid for by contractor OAS. The formerpresident says it,s not his. An ordinary apartment turned into a penthouse. A renovation that was paid by the same contractor. Not to mention, his ranch in Atibaia, where Lula and his family visited 111 times. Odebrecht and OAS spent R$ 1.5 million (USD 500 thousand) to build extra rooms, a new kitchen and to redesign a lake. The formerpresident denies it,s his. The Police wants to find out whether one of the properties was renovated by the family of former President Lula... But Operation Car Wash went beyond investigating the ex-president. Tens ofphases arresting everyone from former cabinet members to admirals. The arrest of former president Lula's Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu, is part of Stage 1 7 of Operation Car Wash. Senator Fernando Collor in Brasilia and Maceio... Search and seizure at the home ofSpeaker ofthe House Cunha. Senator Delcídio do Amaral was arrested by FederalPolice. You guys have no idea how hard it was -to fight the Dictatorship. - What's that got to do with anything? What's that got to do? Someone had to fight, so that now you can be free to investigate. Exactly. And that's what we're doing. Investigating. What about the others? Why are you only investigating him? - You're being selective. - We're being selective? Oh come on, Dad! We investigate everyone! You forget I voted for all of them? I campaigned for them, remember? Now, if they became thieves, and I can prove they did... I saw it in the "Mensalao" Case... I see it every day Document after document, bank account after bank account! I'm going after them all. And I'm putting them behind bars! If you'd rather close your eyes, and keep blindly following your "idols" - it's on you. But me? I'II never believe any of this crap! Never again! - Hey, what's your problem, kid? - Boys! FIan. But we'II keep investigating. Thank you. We have more than enough to request a tap on his phones. Only he has no numbers registered in his name. Not even cell phones. There's nothing in his name. - This is ridiculous. - Hold on. Leo Pinheiro... There's a message in his wiretap... He called from a device, and it seemed Iike he was calling Lula. But the Iine belonged to some guy named "Moraes". That's his bodyguard. He's been using his bodyguard's phone. URGENT REQUESTS WIRETAP RECORDINGS MORAES DOS SANTOS ALMEIDA Standing around staring at it won't help. We have to wait until someone calls. - So...? - Guys, relax. If anything comes up, I'II Iet you know, I promise. Pick up, you bastard. Good evening. May I speak with Daisy? -This is she. -Hi Daisy. This is Moraes. - How are you? - I'm fine. -Hold on a second please. - Alright. -Bye-bye. - Bye. - Hello? -Mr. Freitas, hold on please. That's Wagner Freitas, the Labor Union Federation president. -Hello. - It's Lula! -Hey dear friend. - How are you, Sir? - They're going to come at us with everything! - Yeah? So what? So we could Iose everything. What if they end Operation Car Wash? -"They"? Who's "They"? - Come on, Ítalo. "They". We're putting everything on the Iine because of a detention for questioning? One more month and we'II have enough to indict him. If we shoot at the king, we better bring him down. Listen, Ivan. If we do nothing, "They" are going to bring us down. You heard the tapes. They never stop maneuvering. PIus, you know there are other ongoing investigations that might jump the gun on us, and make it Iook Iike he's being persecuted. The Intelligence Agencies have been gathering information. Several groups and unions. The Labor Union Federation, the Landless Workers Movement... AII of them ready to start a general revolt. - We're in a delicate situation. - Exactly. So in your opinion the the detention for questioning is necessary. He refused to appear before the Federal Prosecutors in Sao Paulo. We need to clarify a few points. The Iink between the contractors and his institute, his speeches, the apartment renovations, his ranch, you name it. There's no room for error. These guys are ready and they'II fight back. If there's a Ieak, if someone even sneezes, -we're dead in the water. - Don't worry, Ivan, I got it. Try not to keep calm. Don't blow up. Just don't take the bait. Oh, come on, Bia. I'm not crazy. Okay, just a Iittle bit. But I'm not insane. - So, what do we call this stage? Operation Falling Star. Good one. Okay, never mind. I'II pick the name myself. Well, Operation... What is it, Julio? - Julio. - What's the matter? - Is it your mother? - My dad. It's been a while since you've been in the field. But you know what? It's better this way. Better you than Julio. You're the right man at the right time. - He's just a man. - Just a man? You're going to strictly follow this procedure. PIain clothes, no police badges, ordinary vehicles. Nothing that draws attention or embarrasses the ex-president. You will protect the former president. CIose the airspace and do not allow pictures. This is a very risky operation, and every detail matters. We're going to need a plane. And perhaps a helicopter. Why willyou need a helicopter? Well, if he's at the ranch there's only one way in. If they close the street, we can only Ieave by helicopter. They're coordinating with the unions -and they will block every access. - And why the SWAT team? Well, the Labor Unions are camped a few blocks from his house. If we can't take him out, they'II break in. - So we'II need the SWAT. - Boss, I'm gonna have to make it Iook Iike this operation is coming from Headquarters. Ifit comes from us they'llknow it's Operation Car Wash, and... No problem, Ivan. Okay, I got it. STAGE 24-"ALETHEIA" 4 MARCH, 201 5-1 2:1 5 A.M. PRESIDENT DUTRA HIGHWAY BR-11 6 - Vini. - Go ahead, Ivan. Don't forget to position our teams at all entrances. We can't do anything wrong. Ivan, you're beginning to sound like Julio. Relax, everything will be ready when you get there. -Good luck, I'llsee you there. - Thanks. Federal Police. We have a warrant. Just a moment please. - See you in a bit. - Bye. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Don't worry, it'II be just fine. It will. Have a nice trip. Good morning, my name's Moraes, the President's bodyguard. PIease. Come in. Turn on the camera. - Good morning, Mr. President. - Good morning. - We have a warrant. - Come in. Excuse me. Is the "Japanese Guy from the Federal Police" with you? - No. - Good. He could steal everything I've got here. I'm tired of telling Secretary Cardozo to arrest that guy! Mr. President, if you please. This is absurd! This whole thing is coming from the Federal Prosecutors Office, isn't it? - From them too. - They want to destroy me. I'm just serving a warrant. - Call Teixeira. - Calm down, Mr. President. - What's going on here? - Just the boys from the Police. One more thing, Mr. President. We're going to need a statement. But we can't take it here. You can't take him with you. This is absurd. - You want to expose my husband. - I'm not going anywhere. - Take me where? - Calm down, Mr. President. We're not taking you to the Police HQ, We're going to take you to the Presidential Hall at Congonhas Airport. Well, I'm not going. You'II have to handcuff me! And then you'II see what will happen to this country! No. We will get your statement. But we won't do it here. It's for your own safety, Mr. President. It's going to be better for everyone. Teixeira, that guy from the Federal Prosecutors Office. They have a warrant. Now they want to take me! What do I do? LARGE CROWD OF DEMONSTRATORS Am I under arrest? - No, Mr. President. - What do you mean, no? You show up at my house at 6 in the morning, -and you want to tell me I'm not under arrest? - This is a detention for questioning. This is the Federal Prosecutors Office being fucking assholes! They say it's "detention for questioning". What? Come on, Teixeira. Talk to you Iater, my friend. Mr. President please. We're not going to expose you. As you can see, we're all in plainclothes. We're not handcuffing you. Trust me on this. We'II see, we'II see... I consider myself a prisoner. This way, Mr. President. As I promised, you will not be exposed. I only ask you to stay behind the driver's seat. The windows are tinted, so no one will see you. I called Sáo Paulo State Police. They'II provide back-up. Thank you, Boss. FederalPolice have taken Former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Demonstrators hit the streets. Labor Unions... A smallgroup ofdemonstrators set offfireworks in the middle ofthe main square on 23 de Maio Avenue. What the Police is doing is wrong. Brazil needs heroes, but you are the heroes. They think they can change the country, erase our history and the president's Iegacy. But we, the people, won't forget. We, the people, see everything! Protesting the operation, members of the party and supporters revolt against the Federal Prosecutors' decision and against the Federal Police. - Demonstrators? - Everything's okay so far. This way please. Vini, stay in this other room with the agents. And no matter what, no one is allowed to come in. - We'II stay here. - PIease sit down. Naturally, the defense will record the statement for its records. Sure. Would you Iike some coffee? I would. Your son's company received R$ 4 million (USD 1 .3M) from your company. - I can't say. - It's all here. If he got paid, he must have provided some services. I don't take care of this. Paulo Okamoto does. He's also being questioned, as we speak. What was your role as Honorary President of the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva Institute? I'm the face of the Institute. It only exists because of me. CIinton's institute, for instance. It's only there because of him. Same goes for Kofi Annan's. Every institute exists because of the person it's named after. Excuse me for a second. You can't go in there. You were only authorized to be here. This is ridiculous. We're members of congress! Who do you think you are? - Moraes called someone and they were given permission to be here, but only to stay in this room. - Can you handle this? - Yes, I can. Apparently, the ex-president wasn't arrested. It's a detention for questioning. Is it usual for companies to spontaneously approach the Lula Institute in order to make donations? I've never heard of anyone giving money spontaneously. Not even the Church's tithe is spontaneous. Well, well, well! Workers Party go to the hell! Is it possible that Paulo Okamoto, or CIara, asked for donations from contractors such as Camargo Corréa... - Yes, it's possible. - Maybe to OAS. - AII of them. - Odebrecht... - That's right. - Banks, Andrade Gutierrez, - UTC, Queiroz Galváo... - Yes, to all of them. AII of them. Anyway, all of those contractors made donations -to the Lula Institute. - I don't know if it was all of them. - You don't know? - No, my friend. I don't know. WORKERS PARTY FOR THE PEOPLE PEOPLE FOR WORKERS PARTY - Lula, President! UNITED FOR BRAZIL Over the years, one of the factors that fed corruption in Brazil... was the fact that the goverment pretended to hire contractors. Then it pretended to pay, the contractor pretended to build and nothing ever changed. But before I became president, public servants pretended to work. The government pretended to pay wages, and Brazil got fucked. Excuse my French. But then, we decided to moralize the whole thing. I seek the truth, Mr. President. I've Iistened to every deposition. So, if you seek the truth, arrest the Federal Prosecutors who claim the apartment is mine. I can't wait for all this to end, so they can come here and apologize. Get down on their knees and beg "forgive us, for goodness sakes, forgiveus." - If we made any mistakes... - I'm fed up with this BS! PIease excuse me for a second. ALL FOR MORO They're inciting them to break in! CIose off the avenue. No one is allowed to come to the airport. -Lula forpresident! - Out with the Workers Party! The State Police tried to split the groups, those for and against the formerpresident. There were punches, kicks, bruises, and much confusion. Lula forpresident! Everything's being done by the book. PIease Iisten to me! AII of you will get in, but calm down! PIease calm down. Mr. President, you're Ieaving this room -in the arms of the people. - No, he will not! Yes he will! He's Ieaving this place in the arms of the people! Yes, I will! Who's going to stop me? You can print this: The war begins today! No way! He was brought here safely, and that's the way he'II Ieave. Safely. Leaving in the arms of the people is asking for disaster to happen! He was elected by the people and he's Ieaving in the arms of the people! No! Stop! AII of you! Moraes, talk to your boss. - We're risking disaster. - We can't do it, Lula. Not today. President, you don't have to Ieave in our car. Your attorney brings the car around the back, and you Ieave with him. Don't go out the front entrance. PIease. When I go back to being president, I'II remember each one of you. And that he did not purchase the apartment. Lula says he's been to the apartment. According to the congressman, Lula got angry when asked about the paddle boats, < at his ranch, in Atibaia. You know we did the right thing, don't you? We proceeded exactly as we would proceed with anyone. - Perhaps even more cautiously. - Look, Ítalo. You know the story about the turtle up the tree that you and Pedro Henrique keep telling? - What if we are the turtles? - Are you crazy, man? Nobody put us anywhere, We're civil servants. We had to pass an exam. We started investigating a bunch of money Iaunderers. - We had no idea where it would take us. - Okay, I hear you. But suppose they Ieave office, Who gets to take over? With what special interests? With what kind of bargaining power? Will this change anything? Who, exactly, are we serving? I'd Iike to believe we're serving Brazil. Ivan, I know you're worried about the consequences, but we can't afford to worry about who's going to benefit politically and who's going to get hurt. The only way to avoid being political is by not being political. That's the old system, the corrupt system. The way it's always been! If we go down that route, we're going to Iose. You know we follow the facts, don't you? If today it Ieads us to someone from a given party, we'II investigate. If tomorrow it's someone from a different party, we'II do the same. Until there's no one Ieft to be arrested. Arrested? Who's going to be arrested? The system always wins, the pen always wins. We took them head on. And you know what? It's over. Head on, it's over. Here, pal! It's over, man. It's over. Four years in office, plus one, five. PRESIDENT DILMA ROUSSEF Now, it's going to be six. For six years, you have been... If he becomes a cabinet member, it's all over? In that case, he gets officeholder's jurisdiction, goes to the Supreme Court, and God knows when he'II face trial. Isn't that obstruction ofjustice? Yes. Of course. But we have no way of proving it. Today we'd Iike to announce a few people that we're bringing to the Cabinet. Starting with Former President Lula. - What did she say? - He'II have the necessary powers to help us, and above all, to help Brazil. It's my investigation that's over. - Edu. - Yes, what's the matter? The president just announced it, it's official. We have to interrupt the wiretap immediately! The government tries to convince that the appointment ofthe formerpresident has a structuralobjective, a reinforcement to change the economy's direction. Arguments aside, Lula in the Cabinet, willbe entitled to Officeholder Jurisdiction, which means he escapes Judge Sergio Moro... Is this a joke? Will this turn into "Mani Pulite"? Next, they'II murder the judge to end the investigations. Then they'II change the Iaws and nothing will come of it! You know the period of time between requesting that the phone companies stop the recordings, and it actually getting done? - Yes, of course. - Well, you better come over and hear this. Okay, Iet's go. -PRES. DILMA,S VOICE; Hello? - EX-PRES LULA,S VOICE; Hello. Lula, I need to tellyou something. I'm sending you some documents So you can have them. But they,re only to be used in case we need them. It,s you,re nomination to the Cabinet. Okay, I see. Just wait there, because it,s on its way, you'llreceive it. -I'llbe waiting for it. - Bye, my friend. Damn! This is all we needed. She's offering him a blank contract to be used when he needs to escape Justice! AII the reasons she gave. That he's going to "reinforce the government", that she needs his expertise... It's all fake! It's right there! It's proven! And no one's ever going to know! It's going to be sealed forever! Fuck! - Are you finished? - No, Ivan, I'm not. We're finished. So, what should I do? Do as we always do. Follow the procedure Upload it into the system because the tap stays active until the phone company stops recording. It's the way it's always been, Let the judge decide. PLAYING AUDIO - Good evening. - Audio recordings expose Former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Shocking recordings that we will play for you now. Thejudge released the recordings. Some criticized it, but the people found out what was happening. Lula didn't become a cabinet member, and Operation Car Wash kept going. When I'm asked if we're changing Brazil, I say no. It's not ourjob to change society. Ourjob is to enforce the Law. Operation Car Wash willnot change Brazil. But millions ofpeople going out, voting, and deciding the direction ofthe country, will. And when I'm asked where this is going to end... Who said anything about ending? Our work isjust beginning.

AIso, Petrobras does not employ crooks. This is very important to clarify. Since Sarney's administration, there have always been political appointments. One could not become a director at Petrobras' without political support. I was approached by members of the Progressive Party (PP), and invited to take over this division. "We're going to appoint you, but obviously, you'II need to help the party with a few things." I said yes, even though I didn't yet know the percentage, and I didn't know exactly what kind of help. But at the first meeting, they said I needed to help. -To help financially. - Help them financially. So, I thought one of the ways to nullify Operation Car Wash would be to find inconsistencies in Paulo Roberto Costa's or Youssef's statements. Such as finding foreign accounts that hadn't been given up by them. That was Eduardo Cunha's (Speaker of the House) thesis. We're talking about seven companies that with Petrobras alone, manage contracts worth about R$ 59 billion... (USD 1 9 Billion) R$ 59 billion. -"M" or "B"? -"B". "B". So, these were the requirements for the companies. They should have technical and operational capability, -and be willing to pay... - To pay kickbacks. To pay kickbacks, and I needed to have a close relationship with the owner, or at Ieast with the president. Well, Operations would send it to the Works Director Engineer. He would pass on a password to our final client, so that the client could go and get paid. So the client would show up and give us the password "Chocolate". - That was the password. - Yes. "I'm here for my chocolate". A conspiracy of the ultraconservative and manipulative media, with authoritarian and partisan prosecutors and judges, has attempted to publicly humiliate the most popular Ieader of this country. I felt outraged! As if I were a prisoner! And despite the Police Chief's politeness, I must say this. If they wanted to kill the snake, they didn't hit it on his head. They hit it on the tail. So the snake is alive, as it has always been. -You,re contradicting yourself. - I'm not considering this. This is not part of the interview proceedings. -You said you received from... - PIease I am not... I cannot accept this interview as part of the proceedings. I'm not going to talk about it. I don't care about it, -and I'd rather not reply. - It's allin the proceedings. It's clear that they're saying that I have abused my authority in the case and that I should be punished. So it's clear that the intention I'm not saying everone's, but but it's clear that the Abuse of Authority Legislation is being created in order to target those who are working on and to prevent the procedures of Operation Car Wash. Yes, I'm afraid. We're talking about some big shots here. We haven't seen violence so far. What about Celso Daniel? Goes to show how rotten is Brazilian politics. Corruption is a stealthy, invisible, mass murderer. A serial killer disguised as potholes, Iack of medical supplies, street violence and poverty. In this moment of turbulence and radicalism, anguish and complaints about the economic and political context are understandable, as well as to the day-to-day crime reports. But even so, it's important this move forward without hate speeches or violence. FOLLOWING THE REJECTION OF THE COMPLAINT AGAINST PRESIDENT MICHEL TEMER SUPREME COURT JUSTICE LUÍS ROBERTO BARROSO, SAID DURING A SYMPOSIUM "OPERATION ABAFA (HUSH) IS A VISIBLE AND OSTENSIBLE REALITY NOWADAYS IN BRAZIL" "THE CURRENT SITUATION MAY GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE CRIME PAYS BUT TO ME,THE IMPRESSION IS FALSE BRAZIL HAS ALREADY CHANGED. NOTHING WILL BE THE SAME AGAIN" - R$ 500,000 in a suitcase. -Which was handed to his cousin. - But at this stage, Bia? -They must think we,re idiots. OPERATION CAR WASH A WORLDWIDE SCANDAL MADE IN BRAZIL 2
