Morning... Piet. Morning, sir. There's no water... Ahh! Goodness! No! ...again. Who told you to come in here? Sorry, sir - madam said it is spring cleaning day today. Is breakfast ready? Madam said not to bother. That's nonsense. Just go downstairs and make breakfast for everybody. The way that Chef Benzo taught you. Okay. This is lovely Listen! The fact that you don't even bother hiding your sex toys anymore, that actually speaks biblical verses. What's the use? You don't do it with me anymore, so I have to do it for myself. But when we finally actually go away on that holiday, Piet is gonna make it up to Sonia. That's the truth. What is the point of buying timeshares if we never use them? Argh... It's a busy time, you know. It's a busy time. When I finally get my hands on that bloody... tender I tell you we will go. We will go anywhere you want. Oh, in the meatime, my sex toys stay where they are. Everywhere. - Aren't you gonna sit and... - No! I'm not hungry. - Hello darling - Keegan! You look so beautiful. Okay, you know what? Pontso has actually made Chef Benzo's special breakfast for us. Come on, sit and eat. Maybe next time, I have an early lecture. There's my boy Carl. Howzit? Okay, okay. I'm on my way... okay... yes... cheers. Bye... bye... bye - I'm not a boy anymore, dad. - Uhm... okay. Listen, this tech business of yours, I mean, it's taking up a hell of a lot of your time. You hardly spend anytime with us. Does it remind you of you? Hmm? Bye. [knocking] Hmm? Viv... Viv. Hmm? There's someone at the door. Uhm-hmm. Vivian, this is your house man. It's your house. [knocking] Well, I'm sleeping. You see now? [knocking] This is why I'm not going to sleep here anymore. Now I have to open doors for people. Okay! Okay, get off me then! Who is it!? Wow! It's like this now? You know what? It's too early for this. We are all out here working while you are sleeping with the landlord? You are even wearing her gown! Is that why you are here? How much discount do you get for your 'tlof-tlof' services? Is that what you came here for? 25%? 50%? Oh, it is 100%, right? [laughs] I so wish I was a man. Piss off! Nx! Here, take this. It's this month's rent. Give it to Vivi. Easy! Easy. Don't say, 'easy'. You know, it's been 2 years since Vivi's husband died and here you are in his bed wearing his wife's robe! What? Are you the "lawyer of the Dead'? Huh? Who judges you? When you are busy with taxi drivers? Huh? Turning the gate into a taxi rank? Huh? Has anyone ever complained? Go away, Macy Gray. What's happening here? Oh no, I'm late for work. I just need water. What's going on? At whose house? Huh? I find you boiling water and using my stove and my electicity? You are wasting my electricity. Vivian, I am late for work. The reason I am late is because you don't allow me to rest. - That's how you pay your rent, Mandla. - [sigh] Or did you forget? There was never an agreement between us on boilng water and bathing Please Vivian, I am late. Please what? You think I'm here to please you. Listen... go to the outside tap, open the water and bath. Or you can go to your room and switch on the electricty and see what happens. - You know you are evil, Vivian! - Whatever! You have a crooked heart! Your heart is... ROTTEN! Nx! Dammit man! Hey... Mingi. Mingi. Hey... Yes, Uncle? Do you want R5? No. No, come on, Mingi. Listen, if you give me your water I'll give you R5. Or R6 then? R10?! Sure! Thank you very much. Bye-bye and don't tell your mother, okay? Sure. Alright! Goodbye everyone. See you all later. Are you mad? I am naked! You took the child's bath water! Listen Rentse, Mingi and I have a deal. A deal that makes it okay for you to take a child's bath water? As she prepares for her future? The problem is that you don't understand. Mingi and I are here... There's no woman who can understand a stupid man. Are you calling me stupid? Hey, stop it! I gave her R10. You are supposed to give her R10. You give a child money, you don't take from them. Oh please! I won't listen to you! Get out! Take the water and leave. I'll raise the rent! But I was still bathing. Hey, Rents... I'll give you a thousand. - Please, I'm begging you. - Just go away!

Bring the money. Hey driver, the people at the back don't want to pay. Can you just bring the money! Yeerrr! Black people! ...violence flared up in the Johannesburg CBD... I'm asking for anything, big man... ...a piece of bread, my boss? "...while some people claim to be protesting against the incarceration of the former president, Jacob Zuma..." "...as well others believe it's just a spark for deeper anger at government..." "...the streets are marked with burnt vehicles, broken robots and rubble...' "...a standoff between police and people running the streets moving in large numbers...' Mandla! Yes, boss. You're late... again. Sorry boss, there's no water in the township. So? So I had to go all the way to Jukskei to fetch some water. I thought you lived in Soweto? Ahh, boss Piet... all the townships are connected, boss. What about the telephone? I don't have airtime. You know what, Mandla? You are causing trouble! Sorry, boss. You...! [gasp] Go away! Yoh! Sir, you have a 12 o'clock lunch meeting with the MEC today. Mhmm... don't remind me. I can't stand pretending with these people. [sigh] - You have no idea! - What? I lost on 3 games. Yes And I gambled with rent money. - Wow, my brother! - It's tough. So where are you going to stay? No, I have an arrangement with the landlord. - Lucky you. Mine releases his dogs on me. - [laughing] What did you have for breakfast, my friend? I just bought two fatcakes and some 'mangola' and ate them there. So you finished them? Yes, they are done. I am hungry and going to the kitchen to find some food. Okay. Uhm, here's an apple. Oh, thanks. Are you new? Yes, I am new. My name is Molefe. Hmm. Mindlos. Happy to meet you. That's Sphithiphithi. Madala! Happy to meet you, also. Are you fine? Hmm-mm. Hmm... This apple is delicious. It is tasty, right? Sweet, sweet, sweet. Can I throw that away for you? Yeah Did you manage to upgrade the workers' equipment for this year's fiscal? Don't know. No. Got to do something! I tell you what, go downstairs to the warehouse... ...get all the excess uniforms from last year... ...and I'll meet you in the reception...Yesterday! Are you sure, sir? We gotta do something. The future of the company depends on it. - Yes sir. - Thank you, Miranda. What team do you favour? Oh, you mean soccer? Uhmm. I love Siwelele. Masokolara! Bloemfontein. Malafontein Singanganga I tell you! I favour "the birds", my man. Don't follow me, follow the birds. Come, come, come Miranda! Quickly, please! When he acts like this, problems follow. Have a heart. He is our boss and he takes care of us. Put those there. Thank you... very much. That's it hand it out to the guys. And the new guy. Okay guys, make it snappy, please. Absolutely brilliant! What's the problem there? It's the bloody beer! Make it look new. Fit it, like a glove. That's it. Hand in glove. What's the matter with your boet? It's pap-pap-papapap-pap! Very good... Very good. Brand new! Okay guys, come in... come in. Let's get a photo-photo! The phone? Oh the phone. Use it on portrait And new guy, come through brother... come in. Okay? Okay. No, silly! Okay, ready? Okay. Chees'anyama! [click] - Look. - Hmm. Ahh... Uhmm. Hmm... I mean, you know, I've always been somebody who's driven by transformation... ...diversity and empowerment. Right from the very beginning. Uhm, no... sorry, I have another meeting to attend to. So... what's the problem? You see, Mr. Cronje... "Mr. Cronje"? Since when? You see, you've been striving for diversity and empowerment for years now. But do you want to tell me, 27-years of democracy later, all you have to show is what? Pictures? But we've always had... an agreement. No sorry, sir - we don't take that here... Please. There's been a crackdown on corruption. I'm sure you've seen that in the news. Okay. So what do you want me to do now? Do you want me to pay more? It's not possible, Piet because your company has been identified as one of those companies that are not progressive. When we look at your organizational structure, it does not fit in well with the government's standards. In fact, it's way, way overdue. So, we have reached a consensus that we will be looking for other companies for this contract. You and your predecessors were very, very happy to take the brown envelope. Listen here, Piet I know that you are upset but if you are going to be insinuating such things with everybody else... Mmmm. ...I'm gonna break you! You hear me? Are we clear, Mr. Cronje? Send my greetings to Sonia. Tell her "Greetings to all at home" Go away! Hello boss., you know, I was thinking? You think that's what I pay you for? To think?! To laugh? The only thing that I pay you for, is to bloody work! You think this is a shebeen? You think this is Soweto? - No, but you know Sphithiphiti was... - I tell you what... I've had you guys... I've had you up to here. All you do is you just take and take, AND TAKE! Until there's nothing more to take and you don't even know who you take from... ...because you are so full of pap! But boss... we are sorry man. Everything is always ruined by you all! This guy is disrespecting us. You know he doesn't see us? - Hey boss. - What the hell are you doing here? I don't know, I was just taking a leak. You know... But you know you are not allowed to use the executive toilet? Yes, I know I was just cleaning the office and the next thing I got pressed and I decided to run. Well, next time you'll go down the corridor and and use the staff facility. If I have to go all the way down the hall and then I go to the locker room and I'm pressed... what if I mess myself? Then... you are fired. Ahhh... one day I'm gonna win the lotto. Okay, until then you go and use the toilet down the corridor. You know there's no "Love potion" in this food? I don't have an appetite. Mandla, I spent the whole day on my feet - cooking. Cooking for you. Send my greetings to Sonia. I can't stand pretending with these people. Just chuck the food in that big tummy of yours and you'll be full. Okay Vivian! I will eat! I want you to have energy today. You have a crooked heart! ...and take! Take! Until there's nothing more to take... He is disrespecting us. ...Hello handsome. I know you feel bad about not taking me to the Kruger on my trip, I saw you sulking last night. But all is forgiven. Hmmm! And now? You have the nerve to complain when I use toys to make myself happy. Where's the toilet? Through there. - Haaa!!! - Piet! Are you alright? I'm fine. What time is it? Time for you to get ready for work. Okay. This is why we need a holiday. Ohh. Ahh... major! Oooh! I'm white! Whooo! Hmmm! My love... Oooh... ...that's exactly what I'm talking about. Ooohhh, Sonia! Sonia?! Hey! Who the hell is Sonia? Who are you? And then, what's with the English... so early in the morning? I...

Yerrrrrra! How can this be happening? I mea... How can I be Mandla? You are trying to avoid paying rent again, right? No, no. I am not Mandla. And I'm Anita Baker then! Who the hell is Sonia? Sonia? Mandla, who is Sonia? Ooh, dad? What's up with the glasses? Woooh! We are way past the midlife crisis. What do we call this? ...it's a new me. You'll get used to it. Sit Pietie. Yes, yes... on my way. Who is that? You. A long time ago. Ohh. Nice. Hmm. It's delicious. Nice. Very good, very good. Hmm. Hey Sbali, there's no more hot water for him. Aah Piet. But this guy is stupid. Yes! Good morning, uncle. Tell me young lady... where can I find a taxi? - Where you find it everyday. - And where is that? At the rank. Rise black man! Hello?

Spare me just one rand please... Oh, black people! - Give the money to the driver. - Give it to the driver so he can give us our change. Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you? Piet! How did this happen? You have used your witchcraft on me. Stop it! It's not me. I don't know anything about this. I mean I went to sleep I woke up, like you, next to your wife. Did you have intercourse with her? No, no! no! She's not my type. This is my car! - Give me the keys back! I want... - Hey! Is everything alright boss? No it's not! This one, alright? He's got my car and other things. I want all my things back. Hey, I'm not talking to you Mandla! Are you okay boss? Yes, I'm the boss. I'm Piet. And you are Mandla. - You are gonna pay for this. - Hey, that's out of line. Do you want me to sort out this problem? Well, it depends. If the problem is willing not to be a problem anymore. Let him go. But keep an eye on him. Hmm? Huh? Boss, can I have one moment? - Hey boss? - Hmm? Can I have a moment with you? - Sit. - Sit? Sure? Sure boss. Okay, what do you need? You know I'm busy doing boss things right now, so make it snappy. Oh okay boss. I am here just to tell you that workers are working, no problem. And there is no stealing of the cleaning material. - You see? - Hmm. Yes, we are doing our best. Okay. So you are my snitch? Huh? Uhm, boss... a snitch? Why don't you tell me more about Mandla. Mandla neh? - Yes - Oh, okay. He is acting very strange, my boss. Strange? Strange like how? Hey man, you know, these days he's not being himself. Alright. Shu Shu! Oh... Boss... it's Friday. And then? But you promised, boss. Today I've had this headache, and I've got amnesia, I forget things, why don't you tell me what I promised you. You said that when I bring forward the information, you'd give me R900 as an increase on my wages. - Ohh! - Yeah You see, you should not worry, I'll pretend as if there is nothing else between me and you. I will say. I am the guy wins in sports bets and gambling. - Okay. - Yes. Alright. So it is nine hundred? Yes. Nine hundred... Nine hundred, right? Nine hundred Okay. One... Two... Three... Four...

And do you know what I'm going to do, my friend? With this R900, I am going to buy lunch for you and I - a full sheep's head for all of us to enjoy. Right? Oh no, Sphithi, I don't eat meat. What! You don't eat meat? No! Are you Rastafarian? No, it's just doesn't agree with me ...but I'd be happy to sit with you and Mandla while you eat. Okay, we will eat, you will watch us eat. That means there'll be more for us. Alright guys, let's get to work. When did you start being so eager of work? - Let's listen to him - No man, this guys hates work I'd like to see Piet now, please. Do you have an appointment? He's my boss. Let me check. Ah, yes sir. Mandla, the cleaner, would like to see you? Tell him I'm not here. Well, you heard the man himself. Maybe try first thing on Monday morning. Well, how am I supposed to go through the whole weekend... like this? Sorry, is there something you want me to do about it? These people. These pe... What? What? Here's that document you... asked for... and tea, sir. Well, I'm happy to see that there's a meal that makes men happy. Is that not so Mandla? Where the hell did you get this stuff? What do you mean? From the street vendor. The same lady we always buy from. I think I'd rather be vegetarian, like the new guy. Stop with your nonsense. I bought this meat so we can all eat together. We are going to finish it today. You are right, Sphithi. Mandla, my brother, have just a bit. Just one piece for me. What's wrong with you? Yoh! This is absolutely brilliant. Huh? Yeah. Don't forget the gravy. It's too good. - Don't forget the gravy. It's too good. - Oh my word! Hmm. Aren't you going to drink? Drink. Easy there. Easy... Easy... Easy! Don't drink it like that! Why are you drinking it like that? You can only drink too much of it if you have a woman at home Because it is a sure recipe to give you twins! And you know, drinking too much of that will make your tummy run! You'll be in and out of the toilet the whole day. Just be careful. Oh... Uhm, Miranda... you know what? I think I'm going to take this over lunch. And really look into it. - It doesn't look good, hey sir? - No, it doesn't look good. It doesn't look good. - But I trust you'll pull the company through. - I will pull the company through. - Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going? - To the toilet. Mandla, cleaners aren't allowed in the executive toilet. Cleaners' toilets are in the locker room. Please, I need to go. Yes, you must go... to the locker room. Before you mess up. Because if you do mess up, you are going to be fired. Go! Gooo... ...These people! I am struggling now. Feels like there's an 18-wheeler truck in my tummy. No, no. This meat was not good. I don't know what I'm going to do? Oh, my tummy. Ooooohh!!! Oh no! You are still on the toilet! I also need to use it, man. Please hurry up and finish! What kind of music is this, dad?

I have to go to work. Oh, get out of here! It's not like that place is paying you well. Okay, I tell you what... I'm going to go to work... I'm going to come back. And then we are going to pata-pata... Uh-uhh! Uh-uhh! I want some "chips"... What chips? You don't remember the "chips"? You did things to me... it felt like chips... Oh, I think I can remember. We are going to make chips-chips-chips! Good morning, Miranda. Uhm... Mr. Mthombo would like to see you, sir. Mr. Mthombo? Your accountant. Oh! Tell him to come in. He's already in your office. Good. Mr M-tee... my old friend. Are you good? It's 'Mr. Mthombo' and we are not friends. Alright that's good. What can I do you for? Ha! Saw what I did there? Forget it. What do you want? - Did you read the report? - Yes I did. Why? - Did you read the report? - Yes I did. Why? What do you mean 'why?' This company is going down and when I checked the statements this morning, you spent R200 000 between Soweto and Cresta Mall. This is my company. I'm the boss. But you can't spend the money that you don't have. How are you gonna pay your employees? What do you mean? I told you... if you don't secure that tender, this ship will sink in 6 months. And what do you do? You spend R200 000 in one day. Okay, okay Mthombo! I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. Not as much as your employees will be when you tell them that they don't have work anymore. Okay, Mr. M-tee, how do we fix it? Restructure... so that you are fully BEE compliant and go for tenders. I like you. It's how you look. Thank you. The hair. But we're not friends - Mandla! - Yebo. You know, I hope "Mindlo" is okay. That he's not in trouble. Hmm. No, I don't want to say anything. - Why didn't you tell me? - Uhh? Mmh? Your company is going down! You are broke! Oh, so now it's my company? You have to do something about it. Listen my friend, I live in a backroom with a landlord that won't let go of my manhood! Okay? You live in a Top Billing mansion in Sandton. You do something! People are going to lose their jobs. You mean you are going to lose your money? I thought that you had savings. The company was my savings. The company goes down, I go down. All we need is to comply. You mean... to give shares to workers... who had absolutely nothing to do with the building of my company? NO!!! I'd rather die! Well then, it's a good thing that the company is no longer yours. Clean that! Hello everybody. I'm afraid I have terrible news for you. Our company is not doing well. And after losing a very important tender... ...we have at most six months before we lay people off. But I'm afraid today you will have to go home. Go to your families, to your loved ones and hold them dear. Thank you. You are still being a "silent Bob"? ...Hmm? What's wrong, love? You've been so quiet all night, you barely even touched your food. Not to mention, you forgot it was Keegan's birthday. It's nothing Sonia! I'm okay. I'll be alright. You know there was a time when you would ask for my advice. We would share stuff. The business is going down and I can't do anything about it. Going down? What do you mean? We didn't get the tender that we so desperately needed. I'm sure there is something that you can do. What? Like what? Use that big mind of yours. Sonia, let me be honest with you, I don't know what I'm doing. Okay!? I don't have any business running this company. People are going to lose their livelihoods because of me. No! No, love! No. You cannot go and blame yourself... Right? Now come, we are going to get some rest and then tomorrow we're gonna to wake up and we are gonna fight. But now we sleep. I think I know what I have to do. Come, come, come... Let's gather around. Let's talk. Yes, beautiful... You are all looking good. Thank you very much for joining us today. Ay-ya-yaaa. This is the day we lose our jobs. But, did he not say he would give us six months? Hmm! It means, when they lay us off, he's going to disappear with our money. Well that's exactly what I would do if I were him. We all know that the company was in trouble for a long time. And I discovered why. It's because of the things that were supposed to have been done many years ago. Many years ago... You know that the objective of the company is to make profit. But its purpose needs to be more about empowering the people that work in it. The company is not about the walls and... the glasses and everything. No! It's about us. It's about a people. So, we've decided to rectify that and we decided that we are going to have every member of this staff... every member of this company... ...to have a share in Piet's Masakhane (PTY) Ltd. - Masakhane! - Masakhane! - Masakhane! - Masakhane! - Masakhane! - Masakhane! And of course I will retain the 10% for operationals, right? But the rest is going to shared amongst you, proportionally. - Masakhane! - Masakhane! That's what we call 'Democracy'. That's amazing. Wow! We getting shares. Okay, you must sign here. And here... And here... - And that's it. Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm happy that we finally get what we deserve. And I'm hoping that the transformation of the books will give us more contracts. What the hell do you think you are doing? - Sorry sir, I couldn't stop him. - That's my cue. - Thank you. Thank you Mr. Mthombo. - Should I call security? That's okay. I'll take it from here. So what? You want to come and use your old chair? Mhm? You think you can just give away everything that I've worked for, just like that? And what about the workers? That's why they earn a salary. Don't you think for a second - that's why this business is such a mess because you don't want to transform? Do you know how much I paid in 'cool drinks'? Haaa!!! Do you know how much you paid with people's lives and their futures? Molefe? I have come to clean, my boss. No, I don't want you to clean No, I clean even if I'm not asked or needed, my boss. Molefe, are you okay? Here? Yes, I am fine. But the two of you are not. A lot of cleaning was needed. Goodness! You two are still confused? Well, sometimes you visit someone's house and you think it is not clean, but when they visit yours, they also think it is dirty. Maybe spending time at each other's houses will teach you to clean up after yourselves. Mona! Molefe! What are you saying? I think it's him. This is the guy who did this to us. Do you know what? Keep your shares. I'm actually not going to be part of a company where the workers are taking shares that they don't deserve. Look Molefe will we be like this forever? For one hand to be clean, it needs the other. One hand washes the other, my boss. No! No! No! No! Just say you want to die. You want to die, right Mandla? Actually, more than anything, I would like this life to be over. But that's not the way that I was raised, Vivian. So, you stand in front of my TV and switch it off... to tell me, "it's not how you were raised"... ...what's going on with you? - I quit my job today. - Huh? I accepted the package. Here's your rent and a bit more. Mandla, what's happening? Do you want to end your life? We can't choose the life that we get. But we need to make great choices along the way, to make a great life of it. Hmm. Okay... Grab a glass and drink your beer Yes Okay, well, I send you lots of love. Alright... Bye. I know you did the right thing. We can have nothing, but if we've got each other, we've got everything. Ahhh! Damn! [whistling] [snoring] Look at that... Voila! And then? Supper. What? Are you trying to kill me Mandla? Just try it. You told me that you couldn't cook. I picked up the old thing. Here... ...and there. Mhm... Why? It's just a gesture. Just to say, "Vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi... thank you so very, very much for every single thing you have done for me." Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Are you dying? No! But. Viv, things might change around here ...for the better. But I'm gonna go for it. I'm really gonna go for it. I'm not gonna sit around, I'm not gonna cruise... ...I'm gonna give it my all! Hmm. You go, boy! Okay, you are being serious? - Yes. - Yes. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Mandla cooks. Thank you. Wow! A white person! Mhm... Do you know him? He was my boss. Hey, Vivian! He knows me! Oh, you know me? Of course I do. This gentleman here, talks about you all the time. Good things only. - Ooh. Can I offer you something to drink? - Yes. Beer, juice or maybe skoppas? No. He's gonna be moving on very soon. Oh, okay. Alright. What do you want here? I've been filling out tender documents for months. And it's been nothing but rejections. Serves you right, Piet. You gave my company away. Listen man, you've got experience in these things, I need your help. I've accepted my lot in life and I've moved on. But it doesn't have to be like that. It's done. Okay, what if there was a way we could return all your stuff? There is no way. If you help me, I'll sign over my shares. And tell Sonia and the kids all the truth. What? You heard me. You help me, we get the tender, you get your company and get your life back. What's in it for you? Like they say, "For one hand to be clean, it relies on the other." I'd rather have 1% of something, than 100% of nothing. You agree with me, right? Let me have a look at these documents. There we go. What? Your whole tender procurement process is incorrect. Scoring a tender is about scoring points. And every single point counts. Will you show me? All these tenders, Piet, that you've been going for... are wrong! You're trying to develop already developed markets. This here, is where the gap is. Township housing. Let's get to work. Okay Mandla, so, on the right hand corner, write down that, over there and there. Won't you sign here please for me? Where do I sign... here? - There you go. - Okay, good. Let's get some juice. This is another thing!!! Like that! And there... Ahh! Jeez! Okay. Here, take. I actually hope that you've got enough to win. After all the rejections, I'll be surprised if I get anything at all. - But hey, it was worth one final shot. - Yes - I wish I could do more. - No, you did enough man. You did a lot. You know, whether we get it or we don't get, Piet. I think your family deserves to know the truth. Those guys miss you there, they just don't know. Yes. How are they? They are doing very well. You know Keegan is finishing her semester. And Carl has offered me job in his company in case this company goes down. You know when they were young I hardly spent any time with them because all I did was work, work, work. Now, spending time with Mingi makes me... understand that you can't get that time back. Understand that you can't get that time back. Yes! You are a good man, Piet. I apologize for the boss that I was. One for you and one for me. Cheers! Thanks, dad. Hmm. So tell me, how is business? Very busy. We've gotta hit some targets to attract... ...some international investors. You know there's nothing wrong with hard work, boy. Hard work is good. But you also have to live a little. Spend time with family. But I am. You know, getting all this came with a lot of sacrifice, not just from me, but for the people that work for me. Time wasted can never be regained. Yep, Cheers! Thanks, dad. That's my boy! Good morning, Miranda. Sir. Yeah? What is that? You know these guys, no man. Morning guys Morning. Hey, are you back now? Amazing! So you are all here. Thank you very much for coming through on such short notice. People, it's been a rough couple of months, you know, with lots of uncertainty. I know some of you went out there and got jobs and you are serving notices... ...while others are gonna be in the streets cause in the next two months there won't be money. You see when this guys speaks like this, he knows that this is the end of the road for us. But fortunately, when you get the help you need success is definite. Yep! I'd like to make an announcement today, that this company has been awarded a housing contract... That is amazing! And thanks to a very special brother, Mandla, Yes Mandla, please... I thought this guy was my friend... Come Mandla! Come. Now thanks to Mandla here, we get to live another day. Amazing. Now, as a token of my appreciation, I'd like to sign all my shares to my friend, you, Mandla. Yes? Yes? You know, I thought the boss and I were working well together. There was a lesson this white guy had to learn. Let's go back to work! Back to work! It's time. Back to work. Ahhh... are we at it again, Vivi? Who the hell is Vivian? What? You heard me Piet, don't act stupid. Sonia, is it really you? Piet, are you drunk? Oh my goodness! I am back!!! Piet! Cronje! Piet! Yeah!!! Sonia Hi? - Is it you? - It is. - It's us! - Yes Piet. We are back! It is us! Oh I see that I am not the only one who was pleasantly surprised this morning? How did you uh... Don't ask me. I don't know. I have no idea. I sincerely hope that, that never ever happens again. No, I can't say that I won't miss your life, boss. Yes, it was... Your life is something else. How's... how's "tap-tap" Vivian? Oh Vivian, she's okay... She's alright. And I'm moving out end of this month. Oh! Look... Uhm... I'm sure she's not gonna be very happy about that. It's gonna leave an enormous hole in her life. Ahhh, Viv? She's a big girl that one. She'll be okay, She'll be fine. You know what, boss Piet? The reason I'm here... Yes. I was not aware that this was going to happen this morning, you know. So I think it is important that you sign your shares back to yourself, you see? I am good. I am fine. You know, I heard exactly what you said about the workers. And uh... I agree Mandla that this company would not actually be in a position and a state that it is in... ...without the enormous contribution of the workers. You keep your shares. Yes... but what about you? Oh, I've decided to accept the package. I'm going to hit the highway with Sonia. It was nice meeting you, boss Piet. And you, Mandla. Schweet. Please say 'hello' to Sonia and the children. Okay? Thank you, boss Piet. Thank you, Mandla. - Do you really have to go? - For real, my darling. It is time for me to go. Please don't leave. I am asking you. Thanks for everything. Mandla, please... Look, we'll chat on the phone Vivian... I'm a phone call away. Alright... Okay ...Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Let's go to bedroom then. Zakes, let's get out of here! Let's go! Let's go, Zakes! - The love potion has worn off! - It's gone! Go man! Go! Bye-bye Vivian! No more human trafficking. Bye-bye! I was joking. You see, this is the opportunity for me to get in there. She is hard to get. - Okay, say cheese! - Cheese! Hi. Sweety, here. I don't know what to say. - Thank you. Come on - Come! - Come, get in here bro... - Let's take a selfie together! Oooh, howzit? Okay smile, Cheese! Holiday Hi, nice to meet you.
