RED PSALM Send her over there. The bailiff wants to talk to you. Only together. Together Together. Together. Come companions, let us sing The sad and sacred song of work The rich are masters of this land The valley and the field belong to them... Rights for the people! Rights for the people! I want to talk to you. "Dear Comrades, I've been watching with keen interest "the recent movements emerging in Hungary. "In Hungary, like elsewhere, the Capital is taking over the national production. "Besides creating new industries, it subjugates agriculture, "and destroys independent farming." May I come nearer? I'd like to hear what you're reading. "The agricultural population is divided "into big landowners and landless proletarians. "We must survive this capitalist revolution. "It brings indescribable suffering to the masses, "but it alone creates conditions "which will make a new social order possible. "It will create men and women with the strength and the will "to create this new, better social order. "Yours sincerely, Friedrich Engels." Did you understand any of that? I understood perfectly well. Did you? Let me see. I want to discuss this with you! We are the workers, we have no freedom Instead of good fortune we have misery Never mind! Never mind! Long live the workers! Long live equal rights! Long live the workers' society! And if happiness and plenty fail All of us will rise And make the long trek Never mind! Never mind! Long live the workers! Long live equal rights! Long live the workers' society! If we cannot live happily We'll have to travel far Never mind! Never mind! Long live the workers! Long live equal rights! Long live the workers' society! Man does not live by the Word of God alone. If we come to an agreement, there will be food. Your movement is a crime against the nation, a crime against our well being! Still, I'll make you the offer once more. We offer you what has always been customary in this country. 32 bushels of wheat, 32 florins of cash, 32 pounds of salt, permission to keep one cow, one acre for growing maize, one for hemp, two hogs with their yearly offspring. If you don't take it, that's OK. You can't accuse me of not having tried to help you... to convince you! Leave us alone, we're under oath! Throw down your arms! Cowards, dogs, that's what you are! We gave you bread! Throw them down, I said! Mr Bailiff! Hey, men! Stop! Help me. Load! Fire! Is there a free man among you? Anyone who does not serve others? Who is master of his fate? No one! Fire! The majority of mankind isn't yet human - the masses are born and live in poverty and oppression! They die of the sickness of others! We inherit the ignorance of our parents! We carry the burden of the few! And endure oppression! We socialists, swear to God Almighty... that we shall serve the Cause till we die! That we shall not want our comrade's penny! That we shall die for our comrades, if need be! So help us God! The evil tyrant has a plan He wishes to suffocate us! But all is fine A gun gives him the answer Come and celebrate our liberator's gun with us! The neighbor's rooster flew to the top of the fence And there it crows, there it crows That the neighbor is a whore So lady, let's play a game I shall be the rooster, you the hen... Cadet! Your revolver! The cat has four legs The fifth is its tail On we go to Moldavia To the land of Moldavia The cat has four legs The fifth is its tail Come companions, let us sing The sad but sacred song of work The rich are masters of this land The valley and the field belong to them We built their castles Which overlook us proudly Which overlook us proudly But what is there for us in this land? Nothing is ours, not a piece of land Only the grave is ours When the end comes Ours is only hunger and poverty But we all will revolt And those, who come to fight Let them die But tomorrow we will be free! Down came the raging tempest We're afflicted by Hell's every curse Now the day is breaking On the ultimate test Our fate may change For better or for worse We look forward with proud hearts We carry the red flag of the workers... Too many masters means no freedom. Too many rich means still more poor. Pomp and ceremony equals idleness. A long history means a poor present. Where people are ignorant, there the tyrants number most. Where there are many false prophets, charity is rare. Yet facing the battle, firm and united Lifting our scarlet flag We proudly stand With us all the world's slaves And the exploited Will fight to find a free and happy land! Yet facing the battle, firm and united Lifting our scarlet flag We proudly stand With us all the slaves And the exploited of the world Will fight to find a free and happy land! They sent me to kill you. The bride is a pretty flower Her garland is made of bluebells He is the happy bridegroom who can say, "She is mine" The bride is a garland of pearls Only my heart is sad The heart of the bride And all her heartbeats are mine The treetop is in bloom The girl wears a garland in her hair The flowers must fall The girl must marry Come my honey, come For my heart awaits you Longing for you, longing for you If you kiss me I'll be happy A pretty girl is all you see The wind dances in her hair Until the following day Unaware of all the disappointments But the flower will fade The girl must marry She will know sorrow Her happiness will end The chariot arrived And soon will take her along But says the engaged girl, "I will never marry" A beautiful flower is married In a crown of lily of the valley He is the happy bridegroom who can say, "She is mine" The girl is a pearl My heart is heavy because I love her The heart of the bride And all her heartbeats are mine Morning Adam Balogh, with the velvet cap Morning, fair Barbara, with the spring in her step Yellow, crimson, all the ornaments... - Do you recognize me, men? - Yes, my lord. Put it here and there! That's a good chap You are the bravest chap My friend, Tyukodi Bercsényi, Bezeredi, Bottyán, Thököly Ulászló, Hunyadi, my friend, Apafy Pal, Osz and Jurisics, Koppány and Dugovich Velvet and silk, put it here and there That's a good chap! I'd like to talk to you. Are you going to listen to me? Men, you know me well. I did not come to reopen old wounds. You're intelligent people. You know the present situation better than I do. But there are things you can't know. The word "economy" is not new to you. Yet, you refute one of its basic laws: that supply and demand determine not only the value of goods, but also the value of human labor. If the price of wheat goes up, labor will be needed. Otherwise it will result in unemployment. No matter who owns the land, this is an iron law. Just as valid today in 1898 as it will be tomorrow. What can we do? We have to think logically. Cheap smallholdings, settlements, consumer co-ops, funds for the disabled, a labor exchange free from politics, handicrafts and, above all, economizing, to enable you to acquire moral capital, and, some day, land of your own. Let me have it. The leaders of the present social system will never relieve the distress... of the working classes, by their own will. We must organist ourselves, so one day the organized workers can set their own power against the present autocratic system. Then it will be possible to make laws protecting the interests of the workers, and ensuring the welfare of the people. Don't take it personally, but you can't even read. Shouldn't the people be educated first and then given rights? I'm sorry. He's dead. Murderers! Scoundrels! You killed him! You killed him! Get away from here! Only ignorant people are timorous, only they tremble. The wise man studies. Nature expects you to challenge her. Then she will reveal to you her secrets, the laws, relationships that govern her. There are those who stood in the way of knowledge. They said, "You are heretics", and they burned you by the thousands, for your own "salvation". But they only fear the loss of their power over you. They are still standing in the way of knowledge. For this is their greatest enemy. Learn, brother, and knowledge will teach you to rid yourself of tyrants! Lo, the bread that men sin and rebel for. But at night, fears and doubt haunt them, by dawn they are gone, but they will cower before a wrathful God! Rights for the people! Don't come near, Bálint. Siding with priests? You're no longer our brother, nor your own master! Listen comrades... Until we've heard everyone, we must forget our resentments. True socialists listen to every new idea, and discuss them. I don't listen to priests, nor argue with them. Nor do I. His Eminence Bishop Lajos wrote to his misguided flock: "Any uprising by the people is fatal, "almost as if the heart of the Earth had rebelled. "The souls of the people would become homeless." Ideals like God, king, country, die in their hearts. There are people who rob you. Unbelievers, pagans, Jews... But you don't turn against them, you turn against society. The hungry, the desperate, see enemies in those well fed and decently clothed. Go on now, cut and hack Lead the peasant's bold attack! Hey ho! Save us, Lord, from being orphans! Deliver us from widowhood. Deliver us from emigration. - From feeding on mangelwurzel. - Deliver us, oh Lord! - From cabbage without meat. - Deliver us, oh Lord! - From starvation. - Deliver us, oh Lord! - From 16 hour work days. - Deliver us, oh Lord! - From ragged boots. - Deliver us, oh Lord! - From struggling under heavy loads. - Deliver us, oh Lord! - From slavery. - Deliver us, oh Lord! Have you got a weapon? Rights for the people! A homeland for the workers! Remember what you used to teach us? "Man, never take a weapon in your hand! "For we want to accomplish the prophecy of Isaiah: "the swords shall be beaten into ploughshares, "the lion shall feed with the lamb, and violence shall be no more." But now, take this, for us, for our poverty. My hand is trembling, comrades. Not for fear of you. But because I've shed many tears over you. I beg you to think again about what you're leading us into. Sober socialists refrain from ravage. However grave the offense, troublemaking is not in our interest. Let ours be a peace loving Party. No riots. Let us demand laws that protect the workers, but let us avoid scandal. The word "Socialist" means a self-conscious worker. Let us not sully this name. I am so sad I could almost die But I still act cheerfully I still act cheerfully Things are not the way they used to be A different sun shines in the sky Things are not the way they used to be A different sun shines in the sky Not the same sun not the same moon... Go forward, friends Under the flag of dear Jesus The way of the brave Ends in victory Trust in Jesus, for he will come He is the true leader... Women, give your blessings as you used to These are the ones who have come out of great poverty. They have washed and bleached their garments in the blood of the lamb. Therefore, they kneel before the throne of the Lord, and serve Him night and day in His church. And He who sits on the throne, spreads His canopy over them. No longer will they starve, no longer will they thirst, no longer will the sun or any heat scorch them. For the lamb who sits on the throne grazes them and they are borne on living waters, and God wipes away the tears from their eyes. Take this over there! Our Lord, Thou who should be President, hallowed be Thy name, by the devotion you bring to the people. Socialism, thy kingdom come... to us as to the whole world! People, thine will be done, so our tax burdens be reduced and our lives made easier. Oh people, deliver yourselves from your oppressors, but do not forgive the tyrants their trespasses, as they deserve punishment for denying human rights and equality. Money, lead us not into temptation, for many of us sell our ideals for your sake, and serve our oppressors as slaves. Science, enlighten our minds, so that we bring our sacred Cause to a good end. Amen. I'll finish this Lord's prayer. Companions, our time has come. He who does not work, will not eat of the bread we toiled for. The fruits of the Earth belong to all! The fruits of the Earth belong to all! If anything should happen to us, if you should never see us again, remember this: the land belongs to those who cultivate it. Tell the cowards hiding behind the children that we despise them. To us they're not Hungarians. Hungarians are chivalrous, honest, open and patriotic. Tell them that I, Aladar Petke-Szentner, will not fight against them. But they should remember: Hungarian society will only be kind to honorable workers. I'll give you ten minutes to disperse. I was not raised to be a policeman To do awful things A constable's man I shall not be To plague the people, I would never do that! I wasn't brought up to be a soldier To serve a miserable government I won't be anyone's mercenary, But a true and faithful fighter for the Cause János Fekete-Nagy, is that you approaching? Yes, it is. Godparents, are you holding him? We are. Bring him nearer. We've brought him. - Did you come of your own free will? - I did. What were you till now? An oppressor of the people. A servant of the rich. - What do you want to be? - A loyal comrade. Repent your sins and confess. Out of cowardice, a base lust for money, and tempted by promises of a happy future, I blindly obeyed the exploiters of the people. I did wicked things. I abandoned honest work for an easy life. I denied my mother and the working people from whom I come. Do you truly repent your sins? I truly and sincerely repent them. Godparents, are you willing to bear the burden of this man's sins before the whole working class? We are. We are the workers, we have no freedom Never mind! Never mind! Long live the workers! Long live equal rights! Long live workers' society! We will teach a lesson to that great lord He will no longer command the poor workers Long live our supporters! Put me down, comrades. How could I give you my protection? My friends and I are very weak. I'll only tell you this: the reason for the misery of the people is that their inherent right to the land was taken from them. They'll be happy again if they take it back. For it is not support they need, but action. Do not think that equality in work and property can be implemented by me and my few companions. This will not be achieved by us, but by the enlightened people. With the butt of the gun And, finally, the bare hand And with the bayonet And on, until the end Not for potatoes and not for beans Just on and on But always, hey, hey, hey... Death has three rules First comes the cart And under the grass, hey... There is stupidity and blind belief János Szántó is dead János Baksa is dead Until the final end Really, really And there, then, hey... The stone is hard And the butter soft And there is nothing else Nothing at all And there is nothing else Nothing at all I swear by God Almighty that I repent my socialist oath, that I consider it null and void. I pledge my word never to take part in any movement directed against the established laws and the established order. Should my present oath be threatened by anyone, I shall inform the Court of Justice. So help me God! I am not afraid of this oath. It has no power over me. Look at me, look into my eyes. In them you'll only see the promise I made to you. But now strengthen me with your forgiveness so that I can deny my comrades and my creed. Look at me as you would look at a good companion whom you'll always remember. Companions, I've been one of you - a poor, landless man. If I can go back to work now, my wife and my children may survive. You've given us many valuable teachings. But I can no longer grasp the demands of the Cause, the riots... In the words of the Scriptures: "We're rushing to our destruction, the Earth will be corrupted, "it will fall to pieces, its sins will weigh it down. "It will fall and never rise again." Oh days, gloomy and sad, wind borne grey fogs Oh days, gloomy and sad, wind borne grey fogs Oh, this one year Has truly undone me If I knew... Which way you go forth Which way you go forth I would plough it with a golden plough With a golden plough Until the end Really for good To the end of the end And there, then The stone will be hard And the butter soft And there is nothing else Nothing at all When an old man on his way to his vineyard, finds a nut on the road, he picks it up and plants it. He knows he won't be the one to enjoy it's fruit, but the future generation. It is the same with me. I know that we cannot achieve our aims. But we want to plant a tree that will bear fruit for the future. We're facing the hangman empty-handed. We cannot avenge their loathsome actions, but we must not allow the rule of terror and its hirelings to stop us! I know if you were ordered you would even murder your own fathers. We are the workers, we have no freedom Instead of good fortune we have misery Never mind! Never mind! Long live the workers! Long live equal rights! Long live the workers' society!
