Don't touch the heating. It's so cold. My car, my rules. Be thankful you're not in the trunk. Why are you so upset, dude? You'll get your money back, don't worry. It's top stuff. Tasha? Tasha! -Hey, Babe! Open up. -Are you crazy? Forget it, you idiot. Are you crazy? Open up. You disappeared for ages. Piss off, Denis! Tasha, wait! I need the box with the phones! Hey, Tasha… No. Hey! -Are you crazy? -Grow up, jerk! They're like new. Hey, wait! They're like new, really! Come! Mr. Groenert! I don't like to disturb you, but… Then don't! It's just that… that chopping down trees isn't permitted here. But it's all mine anyway. Yes, in theory. But this part, from the fence there, belongs to the township. Why don't you help instead of lecturing me? Yes, okay. Why do you bother? You're celebrating on your own anyway, right? Come on, let's go. On three. Two, three! Hey, you klutz, that's antique cherry! That's worth five times your monthly pay. I'm sorry. Where did you hide the other transformers for the lights? In the basement, as always. You know what? I'm quitting. You order someone else around, but not me! If the prerequisites for an identity check are met, you approach the person and do what? POLICE Palmberg. Make contact and de-escalate through communication. That… Yes. Don't talk, show us, please. Brandt. Hello, I need to check your ID. Could I please… Okay, what just happened? Observe distance and self-protection. Correct. Don't rely on them abiding by the rules. Here, let me help you. Palmberg, did you catch that? Okay. Thanks, that's it for today. Have a good day. Hey, leave my hair alone. -Hey. -Hey. -That was a good lesson, right? -Yes. The shoulder throw wasn't necessary. Hey, that was a great throw! It's judo. I've been practicing for weeks. Yeah, it hurt pretty badly. POLICE My mom. Hello? Oh, how is he doing? He's got paralysis on his right side. His speech is affected, and he can't walk. Is he gonna go into a nursing home? No, he's going to have a full-time carer. Someone has to be there when he's discharged from hospital. It's near impossible for me right now. Mom, I haven't seen Grandpa in ten years. Me neither! And I'm about to leave for my skiing vacation. That means you're on vacation. And you're so close. Lottie, please. It's only for one night. You let the carer in, show him around, and you can leave the next day. Okay, I'll go. Thanks. I can't come. What? Why? My grandpa had a stroke and needs somebody to look after him. And that somebody is me. Would you like me to come with you? -You would? -Yes, sure. Yes. It is a bit annoying. We organized the whole trip. And if both of us aren't going… How about I take your car and go ahead with the others, and you take your time, get a rental car and join us when you can. Be quick. Denis! Hey! Come on. Denis, get up. Please! -Come on. -Hey! Up, get a move on. Get up. I'm running late. I've put the job ads on the table. He won't call. Eat your breakfast, smart-ass. Can I go back to my room? -It's not your room. -Of course it's my room. -It's not your room, dude! -Hey! How about "good morning"? You're sharing the room for now. Until Denis has found an apartment. That means never. -Is there coffee? -Sure there's coffee. At the supermarket. We need a few more things. Here's a list. If you've taken the money from my desk, keep it. I charge five percent interest per day. Or give it back. Here. Hey, are you crazy? -What are you doing? -What? He's so rude. Man… Asshole. Why are you in such a rush? If you're late, maybe one of your zombies will die. Then you have less work. Looking after pensioners must have some perks. I'm a qualified geriatric nurse. It's a profession. One you'll need one day, when you're old and sick and hopefully a bit smarter. Besides, I've got a job. Me too. I'm in business. Why are you laughing? You call them today. And take your siblings to school. -Can't they take themselves? -Have fun. -Mom, I can't, I've got an appointment-- -Bye! I bet you don't have a CV. Take off those gay antennas. They are feelers and they work. Yes, they work because everyone feels that you're a loser. -Hey, what have you got on your head? -Hey! Hey, look what she's got on her head! See? Listen, you little wankers. You touch her again and I'll break your paws. -Okay. -Scram. HERO Okay, off you go. That's not our school. -What? -That's not our school. -That's not your school? -We're at Rumford School. Okay, and where is this… Well, in Rumford Street. Hey, you know what? This one doesn't look too bad. Look, pretty moms and all. Just go in. -What? No. -What, no? Same lesson plan. Just tell them you're new. You won't graduate anyway. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KAFKA STREET What the hell? He's knocking everything over. -Oh, no! -What's happening? -Let's get out! Oh, no! -Is he crazy? Hello, Rene. I call you. Voice mail. Fuck, I hope everything is okay. I mean, you owe us money, but you're broke. Then I see you wearing a nice jacket, new sneakers, a new phone, and I think, "Is he showing off with my money?" I'm disappointed. I'm sad. It breaks my heart. I tell Rene, and Rene says, "Kill him as a matter of principle. Or they'll all shit on us." Fuck! Rene, my finger! I say, "Rene, don't be so cruel." I mean, even if I killed you, would I get my money? Am I mad? You bet. You have big problems, son. No money, no job. And, sorry to say, you're not the smartest cookie. So I've given it some thought. I've got an idea. I'll organize a job for you. What? You too, now? What do you all want from me? Adam, you'll get your dough. I promise. Of course I will. Dude, where are we going? A little trip to the country. He was supposed to come tomorrow, when someone is here. We were told it was today. Could you please sign here? At least someone is happy. Where shall I put him? Somebody will be here soon I'll put the keys under the mat. I'll take your car to get to the village. You won't mind. Oh, man. There's nobody there. Well, I've got to go. My hairdresser hates it when I'm late. I'm getting highlights. Bye. We have an informant at the hospital. The old guy is there until tomorrow so no one's home. So help yourself. What do you mean? Gold, cash, the paintings perhaps. Take the ugly ones, they're worth the most. What? You want me to break in? Yes, it's child's play. Nobody's home. Really? Why don't you do it yourself? Did you hear that? Adam, I'll pay you back, okay? But I can't break in. If the cops catch me, I'll end up in the joint. Denis, listen. We've got to work on our communication. You think, you can talk to me like that? -No. -What makes you think-- It's okay. I'll do it. I'll do it. Open it, please! I'll do it! Open it, please. -Groenert. -Hello, Ralf Gessler here. I'm Mr. Groenert's nurse. I just wanted to let you know that I will arrive tomorrow, Friday, in the evening. I'm looking forward to it. We'll get you up again in no time. That's all. See you! Hillbillies. Hello? Say, Is that you, Charlotte? I almost didn't recognize you. Crazy. The last time I saw you, you were this tall and had huge glasses and big braces. Yes, thanks for the memories, Mr… -Just Frank. -Ah. I called your mom, because of your grandpa. Oh, yes. Hello. -Hello. -Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. Wow, Charlotte. -Oh, no. -Yes. I'm supposed to be up there. I've called roadside assistance but until they get here… We can leave a note for them and I'll take you up to the house. Okay? -Yes, okay. -Great. Do you have any warning lights we could place around… I think it's okay like this. Okay. Who'd stuff a dog? Quiet. -Shit. -Let's get out of here. Sorry. I've… I've got the wrong house. My aunt… She has… It looks the same in the snow. And the same cow. Old man, I almost had a heart attack. You've already had one. I'm not sure, but wouldn't it be better if you sat in your wheelchair? How about I'll help you into your Porsche and you help me with the combination, okay? I'll take that as a yes. Not much has changed, eh? No. Nothing at all. What are you doing? Nothing, why? Hi, Grandpa. It's me, Charlotte. Your granddaughter. Frank called us and told us what happened. Mom thought that one of us should be here. So… We didn't expect you until tomorrow. Expect? Yes, I'm glad you're here already. Then we'll finish sooner. How long will it take? What, exactly? How long does it take for you to find your way around a new house as… as a… carer. A carer. Yes, well… A qualified geriatric nurse, if you don't mind. Oh, of course. I'm sorry. Where's your car? I was dropped off. What's the matter? Is he in pain? Yes, perhaps he no longer realizes what's going on around him. We're going to leave you alone now. -He clearly understood that. -Yes? Let's continue outside. Yes, of course. By the way, I'm Charlotte Palmberg. I'm Mr. Groenert's granddaughter, as you heard. Yes. And your name is? DEGENHARD VON HELLENSTEIN Degenhard. Degenhard? Yes, that's my name. Your first or your last name? Yes, well, Degenhard… Degenhard Hard. Degenhard Hard? Okay. That's a beautiful, old German name. Yes, my father was an old German. A very old German. Great, Degenhard Hard. Do you have any luggage? Yes, I left it outside. Shit, you assholes, you can't just leave me here. Degenhard? Degenhard, what a shit name. Yes! Well, I feel so stupid. I must have left my things in the car. -Oh. -Yes. Could you lend me a car so I can pop out to buy a few things? Sure, but my car has broken down and the housekeeper took Grandpa's car. Okay. -But I can call the police officer. He… -No. -No. No problem. -Oh, okay. Fine. Right. So you know all about downstairs? Yes, I do. -Should we be on first name terms? -But we already are. Well, you maybe. But from now on, I will too, Degenhard. How did you get into nursing? My mom's a nurse. I saw it's a good job. It's always warm, the money is good… And when someone passes, you can pocket the cash. Yep, I know. Check teenagers for alcohol, confiscate it and drink it yourself. Really? -Checkout operator? -No, police officer. -I'm training to be an inspector. -That's really something. Look, some warm clothes for you. Maybe something will fit. Okay, then… I'd love to have a bit of a rest. It's been a long day. Okay. No, I have to show you the kitchen. The hospital gave us a meal plan that we have to follow. You might as well feed him now. Feed him? Perfect timing. Dinner is ready! -You can take over. -Yes, great. Okay, old man, can you hear me? Wink with your left eye for yes and your right eye for no, okay? Okay, cripple, I'm in a hurry. Let's get this over with. Open your mouth. Down it goes. As soon as your granddaughter is in bed, I'm gone. Come on. I can toss this out the window. I'm doing this because I'm nice. Are you in a bad mood? Listen… What do cannibals call people in wheelchairs? Meals on wheels. Great, see? And another one. Are you retarded? He has difficulties swallowing. Hello. I'm gonna leave tomorrow. You and Degenhard get on well, so you don't need me anymore. Yes, I understand. I'm tired too. Good night. And now he is a sick old man. You have to work hard to stay fit as you get older. Sebi, he had a stroke. One minute you're doing great, next minute you're in a wheelchair. An uncle of mine burst a hemorrhoid while sitting on the toilet. That's an awful way to die. Sometimes I get the feeling you don't hear anything I say. -Hello? -Are you coming? Was that Nicole? Yes, er, I've got to go now. I have to make sure I get a spot in the sauna. You're all in the sauna together? Yes, the house is awesome. Really? That's nice. I almost feel sorry for him, even though he was such a bastard. You fucking Nazi mutt. Let me out or I'll stuff you. Well, I'll be done here tomorrow. -Looking forward to seeing you. -Put away that stupid phone. -Hey, she's still on the line. -Who cares! -Give it to me. -No! Hey there. Come on, real quick. I have to pee. Shit. This is Sebastian's voicemail. Leave a message after the beep. I just wanted… Yup. What? Oh, no. Shit! Fuck! What? No. No. This can't be true. Snow everywhere. Shit. We're snowed in. Yes, snowed in, but the snowplow will be here soon, right? This is the coldest winter in years. The power supply, many roads and telephone lines are affected… Shit! Once, my grandfather was stuck here for a week. One week? One week? Why are you upset? You don't have to go anywhere. I have to get to the ski hut. Après-ski or what? Are you the backup dancer for DJ Ötzi? You can talk. You look like a pimp from the Arctic. Shit. Okay. What are you doing? Taking care of your grandpa. Is he awake? Well, awake… You can wash him in the downstairs bathroom. Hello? Sami, it's me. -You know Janina from across the road? -Yes. Ask her for Adam Summer's number. Okay, I will. Okay. That'll be ten euros. Are you crazy? Get the number and I'll give you two euros. -Ten, plus five for expenses. -Expenses? For what? Expenses? I may have to buy some flower. She's a woman, after all. Flowers? You are ten years old. Go ask her for the number. We're not getting anywhere here, are we? I'm hanging up. Hold on. Okay, fifteen euros. Fifteen euros for walking across the road once. -Deal. -Thanks. Jerk. Degenhard? Yeah, he's looking like a normal person. Listen, stop making discriminatory remarks? -Sorry? -That's a total no-go. No-go? How can you say no-go when someone is in a wheelchair? That's discrimination. Have you seen my phone? My boyfriend must be worried. No, I haven't. Yes. Degenhard has probably told you. We're snowed in and there's no power. Oh! We've got a generator in the shed for situations like this! If we can get it going, we'll have electricity and heating. Degenhard will make you breakfast. Could you do that, please? I'm gonna take a look at the generator. I'm at the police academy. I think, I'll be a good police officer. And then I'll study law, like Mom. Everything okay? Yeah, I… I bit my tongue. What about the generator? Not good. Not good at all. I've tried everything, nothing's working. This is not your fault. -What? -The generator is ancient. Yes. Wow, that's beautiful. -Yum. -Yuck. Was? Nothing. All good. Come on, Sami. You bastard. Come on, Gandalf. What are you two doing? Physiotherapy. -Oh. -We'd like to continue, please. Watch out, he can't… You have to believe they can do it. Otherwise, they'll never manage. Great, Raimund, we can stand now. Now, let's try taking a step. Come here. Come here. Come on. I don't think he… Yes, great. Come on. Great! Yes! You're doing great. Now we have to start all over again. There. Phew! -He smells a little. -Smells? He stinks. Are you sure you gave him a wash? Yes, of course. I think you need to do it again. I think he may need a bath. Me? No, that's a job for an exterminator. ADAM'S NUMBER 01723724836 SAMI Where are you calling from? Are the cops listening? No, the cop just dropped off the granddaughter. They think, I'm the old guy's nurse. -What's so funny? -You're kidding me, right? You have to get me out of here. Rent a snowmobile or something. Snowmobile? Sure. I'll ask the armed forces for the chancellor's plane. Did you smoke something? -I'll pay for it, I swear. -Wait. Something about that sounds unbelievable. Hmm, it'll come to me soon. No, really, there's a safe here. Did sir try to open it with a drill? Yes, of course. What was in it? -A lot of dough. -Okay, I'll think about it. Rene says that if you fuck with me, I should kill you. You better have the dough. I'm not asking you to do anything if anyone is listening. I'm confused. Do you want the money? You know exactly what to do. But I don't know you, ok? I'm gonna hang up now. I don't know you. Hello? Okay, stinker. Blech. Come on, let's do it. Phooey Shut up, stinker. Is everything okay? He's clean now. You found my phone. Thank you. I think you like Degenhard. Uh-uh. Why? You're in a much better mood. Right. I forgot. You don't like anybody. You know, we're taking care of you. And neither me nor Degenhard had anything to do with your stroke. Does sir have a drill? No. Because everything here is ancient. There isn't even any power for any fucking drill. Sh! Piss off. Piss off. Come here then. Look! Some sausage, huh? Delicious. Here. Max? Here you go. Gandalf, here's some apple juice… This is Sebastian's voicemail. Grandpa! I was bringing him juice and found him holding a gun. Are you crazy? That won't solve anything. That's no reason to kill yourself. I saw pills on the floor when I first arrived. I saw them. I should have known. It's not your fault. Stop telling yourself that. Maybe he wanted something else, and it's a misunderstanding. I thought he had improved since you've been here. You managed to get him to walk. A bit. And he smiled a little, after you had a bath together. Hey… I'm sorry. I thought I didn't care about my grandpa. I hadn't seen him in ten years. -What? -And now he's… You hadn't seen him in ten years? My mother would slap me if I hadn't seen my grandpa for ten years. I'm sure your grandpa didn't behave like a bull in a china shop. My mom always said, "If he acts like this, he deserves it." My mom always says, "Family is a godsend." No matter how much you screw up, they still love you. Okay. -Let's secure the gun cabinet. -Good idea. You're a pro. Sorry, Grandpa, it's for your own good. Thanks. Okay. That should do. Thank you. What for? You saved his life. And you really care for him, even though he can be a real bastard. Sure, that's my job. Yes, and you're good at it. I'm sure your mom is proud. Yes. I'll check the generator. Yes. You're banned from driving. FOR CHARLOTTE ON HER 17TH BIRTHDAY Veronica Palmberg, Please leave a message after the tone. -Hello, Mom… -Veronica Palmberg. -Mom… -Veronica Palmberg. Please leave a message after the tone. -Mom, I… -Veronica Palmberg. Please leave a message after the tone. Mom, it's me. You said, I can call any time. It would be nice if you could call me. A lot has happened. Bye. Come on. Yes! He did it. Degenhard managed to start the generator. We have electricity! Hello, Ralf Gessler here. I'm Mr. Groenert's nurse. I just wanted to let you know that I will arrive tomorrow, Friday… -Gessler? -…in the evening. I'm looking forward to it. But he said… We'll get you up again in no time. That's all. -See you! -He was supposed to come today? Grandpa? I know this is hard for you… It's possible that Degenhard isn't a real nurse. You knew that? He may be a criminal. He's a burglar, right? Shit. Why didn't you say anything? Were you going to shoot yourself? The whole time, I thought he'd saved you. He's dangerous, right? You didn't want to eat because he tried to poison you. Where's Max? Oh, no, Max. It'll be all right. Hey, look what I found. I'll chop the wood and light a fire. We don't have to. Just a suggestion. Is everything okay? Stay where you are! I know you're not the nurse. He called. Stay where you are. I can explain, okay? I bet your name isn't Degenhard Hard. Charlotte, no one's called Degenhard. Stop running away. -What are you doing? -I'm calling the police. No, don't call the police. Ah! -Country code for Mongolia… - Police! -…zero - one - nine… -Charlotte! Charlotte, stop running away. -Get out! -What are you doing? Get out! Where are you going? You killed Max. What? Relax. He's just sleeping. He is 300 years old and will die one day anyway. My boyfriend knows where I am. If anything happens, you're in trouble. Sure, your fab boyfriend is coming to save you. He sure will. As soon as I call him. When he is not in the sauna with another girl. He wouldn't even save you if you were in the forest with Hannibal Lecter. I overheard you. My phone. -It's your fault. You pushed me. -I pushed you? Listen… I'd like to keep talking but we have to get inside or we'll freeze. Shit. Maybe my grandpa will hear us. He can't help us. I unplugged his wheelchair. Is there another other entrance? A basement door? Breaking and entering is your thing. You're the criminal. Here. Put those on. Thanks. All we have is the open window. Is there a plan B? I'm thinking. -Shit. -Look, I'll give you a leg up and you climb up there. And from the canopy you climb in the window. Okay? It's too high up. I can't. Yes, you can. I'll help you. Okay. Okay. Ouch. Yup, okay. -All right? -Yes. Okay. Max. Hello. Hello. It's working. Charlotte, open up, please. I can't leave him outside, he won't survive. But he is a burglar. Charlotte! I'm the world's worst cop if I let him in. Hello! Charlotte, I'm freezing to death out here. Come on, please. Charlotte, open the fucking door! Why should I let you in? You wouldn't be inside without me. Please let me in! Why should we trust you? Listen, if I freeze to death out here, that's failure to assist. That's an offense. First step, safe distance and self-protection. What are you doing? What does it look like? Get down! Charlotte, I didn't want to do this. I was forced to. Stop it. Come on. -That's your shoulder throw -I'm more into the theory. Great career choice. Says you. Charlotte, that's silly. Come on, give me that. I'm sorry, that was a reflex. What are you doing? Hello? You're a burglar. Well, even if you're a victim yourself. I help you get back in and to thank me you knock me out? How do I know that you are really a victim? Stop calling me a victim. Ok, take off my clothes. -Excuse me? -My clothes are wet. I'm getting pneumonia. This is torture. Take off my clothes. I can't undress you. I don't even know you. Oh, okay, listen. Forget Degenhard, that's not me. My name is Denis. It's nice to meet you. A pleasure. Now undress me. Come on! I can't do it. -What are you actually learning? -We have handcuffs. Stay cool, Jackie Chan, okay? Truce until I'm gone. He needs to eat something. That would suck. You survive a stroke, and then you die of hunger. Very funny. He doesn't want any. Cooking for cardio-vascular patients. What bullshit. Let's not forget dessert. Charlotte. I know how to whet his appetite. Hello, Grandpa. I've got your dinner. I've put him out of action. You just can't trust someone like that. And he's surprisingly weak. Maybe now it'll taste better. Yes. Very good. Sleep well. I think this is beyond recovery. It's hard to recover when you're old and frail. Nothing's forever. I meant the armchair. Yes, me too. It's working again. I bet your boyfriend hasn't messaged you. How would you know? Because he's an idiot. How he talks to you. Sometimes he's nice. And sometimes he sends me sweet messages. -Really? -Mm-hmm. Show me one. Show me a sweet message. Okay. Here. "Did you study for the upcoming test? LOLV, Sebi." LOLV means lots of love. Yes. LOLV is also a license plate area code. LOLV means "I'm an asshole." I'm not as smart as you, but the guy is an idiot. You deserve better. Think about it. How did you know LOLV is a license plate code? Auto memory. You know that you can report those guys who you to break in here. What? No. They are ice-cold. I can't just turn them in. They know where I live. And then I get someone like you assigned to me for protection? You have no idea what I'm like as a police officer. You take the arm and throw it over your shoulder. Man, I can't do this shit. I'm sure you have other talents. -Yes, I do. -What are they? -Skiing, for example. -Skiing? Yes, I learned from my grandma. I was in the junior team. -That good? -Good? I was awesome. Awesome, for a girl. Charlotte, I didn't mean it. It was just a joke. Sure. Stop crying. I'll teach you how to ski. Right here is where I learned. Okay, but at night? That's a tiny slope to practice on. Come. Just follow me, okay? Hey, where are you going? Shift your weight! Okay! It's stupid. Takes three seconds to get down and an hour to walk back up. Well, most people take a bit longer to ski down than you did. And normally you ski around the trees. Did you just… No, wait! What about keeping a safe distance? Sorry, that was a mistake. Why? Because… I'm… with Sebastian. I can't… Let's go inside. I'm sorry. Solo trip in the morning? Sheesh. Come on. Okay, Grandpa, here's some real food for you. Look, pancakes. -Hi. -Good morning! Hey. He went for a walk all by himself today. That's great. Well, Nordic walking was on tomorrow's schedule. Thanks. He knows we made up. That we… you know. Huh? What? Likely you won't talk for another ten years. Well, he won't talk to me. He was the one who broke off contact after a fight with my mother. That's not nice, Grandpa. Exactly. And then everything escalated. Why that? He was determined to add a terrace. My mother told him he couldn't do that without consent from the municipality. He did it anyway. You'll also tell me he murdered someone and buried the body, right? You haven't talked for ten years because of a terrace? Well, that was the last straw. He cut my mother out of his will, and we were no longer welcome. Not my mother, and not me either. I have to see this terrace. You can't. He had to demolish it after my mom reported it. What? Your mom reported her father because if a fucking terrace? Hello? She is a lawyer, and it was illegal. It could have been dangerous. Have you ever watched Fast &amp; Furious? No. Okay. Dom and Brian are family. Total opposites. One is a police officer, the other is street racer. But when the going gets tough, they stick together. That's family. -Ciao. -Ciao. Oh well, the roads are clear. That's great. I'm glad. Yeah, totally. The nurse should be here soon. The real one. And I can leave too. Finally. You should get changed. Otherwise, the Kelly Family will sign you up. Yes. Okay, then… I'll go pack. I have to go, too. Great. Hey, have fun… At the stupid ski hut. Travel expenses, okay? What? Pain and suffering damages. I had to wash you. Charlotte, package for you. You should learn to communicate better. What's that? They're all for me. Here. Christmas, ten years ago. For my 14th birthday. Well, boy. Take care, Nazi mutt. Stop! Stop, please. Hi. Hey, I'm glad you answered. When are you coming? I'm leaving in about an hour, okay? Great. I'm out of hair gel, the one from TG. You can get it in the village. -Could you maybe… -I know, your ego boost. That's the one. Can you bring some? She hung up on me. Shit. Charlotte? Denis? Hey! We thought you were hiding. But you wouldn't, would you? -Did you bring them here? -No. It's… Let's go, okay? I'll get you the money. I'll take care of it, I promise. Yeah, sure, let's go. I'm going to pee. Can you make some sandwiches for the trip? Don't forget the pickles. Are you stupid? Does my car say cab on it? What's that? It's nothing, man. "Charlotte. I'm off. Even though the whole thing sucked, I'm still glad it happened because we got to know each other. Denis." -Dude, you got money, let's go-- -Hey! I didn't come here for a few bucks, got it? So, where's that fucking safe you were talking about? What safe? I thought it was open. I tried everything. The number. give me the number. I don't have the number. I'm not talking to you. I don't know the number
