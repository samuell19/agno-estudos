You know my mama ain't gonna let you. I don't know. I was gonna walk. I don't know why you got on all that makeup anyway. It's not like it's Miss America. No, it's not. It's Miss Juneteenth. Mama... stop worrying about them. You look good. Okay. Let's go in there. Young ladies. we must remember the reason for this pageant. Juneteenth is our holiday, where we recognize when the slaves of Texas finally found out they were free. Two long years after Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. The date was June 19th, 1865, now known as Juneteenth. So, you see, ladies, not only will you represent your beautiful selves, but our history as well. And now, our reigning Miss Juneteenth Sonia Cobert. As the winner of Miss Juneteenth, you will receive a full scholarship to any historically black institution of your choice. Sonia has chosen Texas Southern University to attend in the fall. We are so proud of you, Sonia. You could show a little enthusiasm. Can I have my phone back? Yeah. Turquoise. What a pleasant surprise. - And this must be your daughter. - Mmm-hmm. A Miss Juneteenth hopeful, I presume. Kai. She's so very excited. Well, we will ensure that she is transformed. We strive to uphold the tradition of creating successful young ladies. One of my greatest regrets is that you didn't get to crown the winner and take your final walk as the reigning queen. What a thrill it would be to see your daughter take hers. - Beautiful. - Thank you, Mrs. Washington. - Please sign in here. - Yes. Turquoise Jones... is that you? I haven't seen you since the pageant. It slipped my mind that you have a daughter old enough to be in the pageant. - How old are you? - Fourteen. About to be 15. "About to be." How wonderful that you are looking to replicate your success. And I know how important that scholarship is, like it was for you. Now, if she's accepted, she'll need to maintain a 3.5 GPA, represent herself well in the community and attend all rehearsals, okay? Mmm-hmm. Good luck to you both. Yes. Come on. What's her problem? I beat her. Where's your homework? Last day of school is next week. You better hope your grades turn out right. Mama, I'm old enough to stay home by myself. Um... Imma bring you a plate in an hour so you'll be hungry by then. Get all that work done. Don't come out till I come get you. ♪ Come over to my place... Good on you!

I told you to park down the street. - You ain't gonna put air on? - You don't. - Give me that. - Mmm. Give me that. I'm gonna do right by y'all this time, Turq. Junior bumped me up to full-time. You ain't fixing cars in the yard no more? It'll be good for her to see her mama and daddy together. You got something for her account? It's a little short right now. - Turq. Turq. - Stop! Wait. Stop. Turq, quit playing. Turq, quit playing. Mmm. Now, one, two, three. $4. Is this why we're here? I've been holding it down a long time around here. Babe... that's not how I meant it. You know, an $800 dress just don't make no damn sense to me. Where did you get yours from? - The goodwill. - And you won. I don't want her in no thrift shop dress... thinking she less than them. I want her in the best when she wins. You always had big dreams. I'm gonna make sure that she's somethin' that we ain't. She my dream now. I hustled hard for these. When you gonna put 'em back on? When I'm sure. I wish I could afford to bring you on full-time. Business has been slow. The good news is the loan finally came through for the new building. Look at you. It must be nice having your own... Ain't no white folks giving me no loans. Black man said he saw potential. They know a good investment when they see one. Funeral home's always gonna have good business. I wish I could have found me something to run. I always thought at some point I would, but, you know, time... get away from you when you trying to pay the rent. Thank you. When we get the new place, uh, work'll pick up. Hopefully we can bring you on my regular. I hate to see you working so hard. You need someone to take you off your feet. How's Darlene doing? We broke up. Why? She ain't you. That's a dang shame.

This here is for the registration plus a little something for yourself. Um, I'll put the extra on Kai's birthday cake. You wanna come with me to get it? I'm going fishing with Catfish in the morning. Imma take her somewhere special on her day. If you do real good, you can go to Spelman. The women coming out of there do big things. Ain't that a girls' school? Remember you took me to State Fair Classic and they did the battle of the bands? Mmm. When them dancing dolls came out... They it tore up. If I got to go to college, I wanna go somewhere like that. Or I can go to Prairie View like you did. You worry about the wrong thing. If I make the dance team, I can get me a scholarship, - like you want me to. - Mmm. But them girls did dance in high school, so they got experience. Ain't no school handing out no full ride for that. I need you focused on your studies. Once you get there and you've been doing okay for a while... maybe. This one is very special. Top of the line for the pageant girls. Young lady, do you like it? It's beautiful. How long will it take for the alterations? At best, a few weeks. And we don't have layaway here. I'll put down the deposit today and pay for the dress in full at pick-up. I'll rush to get it ready. Thank you. Are you ready to go tell it on the mountain? How many of you ready to give your lives to Christ? Everyone, in God first confess your sins. And all will be all right. Go tell it on the mountain! Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus! Hallelujah. Yes, thank you, Lord! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah, Lord! Thank you! Yes! Yes, Lord. Bless me, Jesus! Hallelujah. You let me know if you need any help with that program 'cause I'm here for you. I will. You're such an angel, Sister Charlotte. I don't know what I'd do without you. Just doin' what God has asked us all to do... serve. - Amen. - Mmm. I want you to meet my daughter and my granddaughter. I didn't know you had a daughter. Why aren't you in church like your mama? I've been trying to get her. I'm trying. Baby steps. Gotta start somewhere. Amen. Hey, Granny. I've been trying to reach you, get you down here. - You here for service? - No. What you doing disturbing my worship time for? Mama... Um, can you watch Kai for me? I gotta pick up some extra shifts at the bar. So, you can do that devil's work? I'm doing the best I can. Saving up for her dress has me a little short. Pipe dreams. You won that thing. What good did it do you? This is your child, not mine. I'll be here till late helping Pastor. Let's go. Thanks for the coffee, girl. Mmm. You're working on your poem. What if I danced for my talent? Mmm-mmm. I won with that poem. I can win with this. Turn that TV off. Let's practice. Watch them eyes. Come on. My name is Kai Jones, and I'll be performing Phenomenal Woman by Dr. Maya Angelou. Now, you ain't gonna be able to use that paper up there. "Pretty women wonder where my secret lies." Come on. Be serious. "I'm not cute "or built to suit a fashion model's size." "I'm not cute "or built to suit a fashion model's size." Pageant ain't that far away. - Well, then you do it. - I did. "I am a woman "phenomenally. "Phenomenal woman, that's me." Mama! An alligator, Ronnie? Look, the shit ain't funny. The thing came straight at me and Catfish with that mouth all wide looking like... I don't know. Turq, these white folks acting like that thing couldn't have swallowed us whole. Talking about the nature law, saying you can't shoot no damn gator there. Thing had to be, like, 13 feet long. You know I ain't been in jail since I was young and wildly. They're talking about making me pay this shit off in the fields. I work it off in the fields like we back in the slave days. You gotta get me out of here, Turq. How am I gonna do that? With them hustling this is gonna be like... We're talking about, like, 700 just to get me out. And then, at a later date, they're talking about, like, $5,800 in payments for the gators or something. Where am I gonna get that kind of money from? I just went full-time on that job. And if I don't show up on Monday... I'm gonna make it back. I promise. Dessert fork. Very nice. Water glass. Very nice, ladies. Ladies, you must always use proper etiquette at the dinner table. Now, we're going to see who's been studying their handbook. It's time to demonstrate a little more of what you've learnt. So... pick up your salad fork. Your soup spoons. Stop copying me. Your dinner knife. That is your salad knife, not your dinner knife. One would surely not eat the main course with that. Ladies. Ladies. Kai... it's imperative that you learn these things for yourself. Miss Juneteenth is here to prepare you for the future, to reach your highest heights, and I know you can do this. Ladies... white wine glass. Kai? Kai? You hear me calling you? You didn't pay it? I called them. - Those bastards. - But did you pay them? I had to pay your pageant fees. Look, 14 don't make you grown. Fifteen. Hey, my battery about to die. I got something for you when you decide to come out. Okay. Mmm. Happy birthday, baby. Let's just go out. - The truck stopped. - Wait. They ain't gonna let Daddy out? Everybody been texting me about it. We're having "a let there be light" party. Mmm-hmm. Kai. Mmm. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm. No, no, no, no! Stop. No! Be careful. My girl. Okay. It's my birthday so I get to wear the crown. Introducing Ms. Kai Marie Jones, queen of it all. Mama, don't I look good? It's for the queen. Yes, ma'am. - It's pretty. - Yeah. - How much did you spend on this? - Oh. Why didn't you put it on the lights? Why didn't I put it on the lights? Mmm-hmm. I'll take care of it. I'm picking up some extra shifts. That is why you're gonna have to stay with Ms. Burke tonight. - It's my birthday. - Mmm. The lady of honor... ...says she sees things? - Not real things. - Don't start. Come on. I'm gonna wipe it. Mmm. Go wash up. Come on, come on. Go, go, go. - Okay. - Gonna make me late. Hey, don't I know you? Yes. I was Miss Juneteenth. Oh, here. Mom? ♪ And hit the floor ♪ It's BYOB... Come on. ♪ I feel I feel like shaking something ♪ Whoo! ♪ Shake something ♪ Shake, shake Shake something Shake, shake ♪ Hey, I'm feeling... Big 15. Got that fire for your birthday. Been messin' around with these beats. You could use this one for them tryouts. Come on. Thought you were off tonight. Mama. Stop. Stop. Come on. It's just water. Was I a good mother? Is that your liquor talking? I know you think I was hard on you. You made it through. I wasn't surprised when you won that crown. You got your looks from me. Momma... I won that pageant 'cause I worked hard. It takes more than looks to survive. Not in this world. Not if you know how to use 'em. Looks is all a woman needs. - Get up. - Huh? I'm out here working like a dog for you and you're sneaking boys up in here? He just brought me something for my birthday. Mmm. Fourteen. Fifteen barely. I'm not a baby. - I ain't gonna be who you want me... - I will... Hi, Mr. Willy. Oh, my goodness. Welcome to the Juneteenth Museum. Thank you, sir. Ladies. Ladies, come on. Now, when Lincoln freed the slaves, Texas did not mind him. As a matter of fact, other slave states would send their slaves to Texas. Now, approximately 30% of Texas population were slaves. So, you can imagine how much money the slave owners would lose if they let them go. Now, Major General Gordon Granger made it to Galveston and he read the Proclamation of Freedom. General order number three declaring slaves free in Texas. And there was a joyful celebration in the streets. This way. Here we have our first wall, and over here we have our Miss Juneteenth wall. Oh. Ladies. Our former Miss Juneteenth winners have gone on to great things. Chandra Mobley, famed civil rights attorney. Mmm. Dr. Minny Adams, neurosurgeon. Celeste Fulton, wife of Congressman Fulton. So, you can see we are expecting greatness. Thank you. Take a look, ladies. Okay, so like this. You gotta go like this. - Okay. Go one, two, three. Lift that up. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Throw it up. And catch it. Yeah. Okay, from the top. You got it. Do we say something when we catch it? - Yeah! - Yeah! - Right, left, catch it. - Catch it. Throw it up. Yeah! Come on, Mama. Uh-huh. We'll go from step back. Step back. One, two, three. And then, hit. Huh! - And then... - You gotta say... Yeah! - Okay, come on. - Yeah! So, lean. Come on, Mama. Go right, left. Right. Throw it up. And catch it. Yeah! Oh, wait a minute. "Yeah" as you catch. Okay, come on. We need a new door on this cooler, a stall in the women's restroom, dance floor lifting in places. You and your ambitions. Child, folks don't come down here for no five-star restaurant. They know it's a hole in the wall. It don't always have to be. Game fishing in the nature's preserve. Should have took his behind out of the hedge just like everybody else. And you got him out. I want Kai to have both her parents. I ain't have that. You a beauty... and you're smart to boot... you just make bad ass man choices. You're gonna make me burn these ribs. Hurry up and finish stocking. Bar ain't running, bar don't make no money. I'm already rushin'. I gotta pay on this power bill, then run by Bacon's. You know they movin' soon. I warned him about talking money from them white folk. The one he had was just fine. Nothing wrong with trying to do better. - That's the American dream. - American dream? Ain't no American dream for black folks. We gotta hold on to what we got. Look, it may not be as fancy as you want it around here, Miss Juneteenth, but it's mine. I own it. Free and clear. And the white folks down at the city have been trying to run me off for years, but I got my papers. And when you get yourself something worth holding on to, you make sure can't nobody take it from you. You hear me? He going out the way he wanted. We selling premiums like you wouldn't believe. I'm making sure we give folks the homegoing of their dreams. That's how it should be. How's that pageant going with Kai? - Like pulling teeth. - That's why y'all different. You put your everything into that pageant. I was proud of you when you won. Yeah. That crown don't make some magical life where all your dreams come true. Good to see you, Reverend Patterson. How's that girl of yours? Growing like a weed. Too grown for 15. Lord... I remember when you were 15. Bacon chasin' after you even way back then. Daddy, ain't you got some embalming to do? Loosening up my knees. When Granddaddy started out, there were no black morticians in Fort Worth. He started in a little home on the south side, moved here. Now, we gonna be in over 10,000 square feet. Mmm. It looks like you're ready. You're really making a way for yourself. I learned how to make it happen from you. You always had a plan. You're meant for more. Could be the first lady at this funeral home. Bacon. All you do for Kai, I can take care of all of that and more. You're too good of a woman to be living the way you do. What way is that? I make it work. I need to catch my bus. Can't be as bad as me. Your mama ain't making you do something you don't want to. I don't even like standing up there, acting all stiff, saying that poem over and over. All I'm saying is somebody making me do something I don't wanna do... I'd figure I make up my own. Damn. Who died? I mean, really. Only if it was candy coated. Hold up. Is that your mama? I better not ever see you at my house again. You understand? Get in the car. I told you about that boy. He was just sitting there. Whose car, thing... Whatever this is. Bacon let me borrow it so I can get your daddy to fix the truck again. Where did you get that from? Daddy. On my birthday. And where's the one I brought you? In my bag. Why you gotta pick me up in it? It's a ride with a full tank of gas. Stop being ungrateful. Why couldn't you let me walk home? Everybody saw me. You always embarrass me. Brianna's mama said you were a stripper... ...and you'd be getting on the men. That you're Miss Juneteenth. I ain't sorry for putting food on the table. You could have done something else. And you don't know what was going on. I'm trying to make it so that you ain't ever desperate like that. Baby, I know it's hard to understand, but we're... Come on. Should I deuce him? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! Yeah! - Down the hole. - Damn. Yeah, give me that. Yup, give me that. Fifteen. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. Pleasure doing business with you. See, my baby don't play. Here. I'm glad you came out to hang with me. Take that. Put that on your dance team. - For real? - Yeah, for real. You think it's fake? Hell, now you're over here cheatin'. Man, nigga, say I'm cheatin' again. See what the fuck's gonna happen. I'll crack your motherfucking skull. Step out from here. - Hey, hey, hey. - Daddy. - Hey, hey, hey. - Y'all cut that shit out. Y'all are scaring my baby girl. Let's go. Come on. It's all good, baby. We all good. Uh, Mama on her way. You told her we here? Now, you know dang well you ain't supposed to have her up here. Oh, come on. What you driving this for? Hey, she was with me. She... Wait, wait, wait. She needs street smarts just like she needs them classes on how to eat. Put on your seatbelt. Hey, don't be mad at me. Here, here, here, here. Put that on your light bill. I already put enough down on it for them to put it back on, but I'll take it. I even made enough to pay you back. Well, where's the rest? 'Cause if you got it from in there I know it ain't gonna last long. - Don't play. - You know I can't carry that kind of money on me, girl. She need to have it on the day after tomorrow. All right, I ain't playing. I'll be there. - At 6:00. - 6:00. I'll have it there at 4:00. Put that money in that man's hand. Um, thank you, Mama. I'll get her as soon as I get off. I told you it's no problem. Glad to have this young one in church with her gran. Pick her up from the house. Okay. Mama. No drinking tonight. Okay? I'd never put the child at risk. Come meet my prayer partners real quick before you go. I'm late. I can't. Just take a second. Just take a second. Pastor wants us to start bringing our families to Bible study. I wanted us to come as a family. Oh, yes, Lord Jesus, someone gonna come. Come in the circle. Pray to Jesus. Yes, right over here. Yes, Lord. Let's hold hands here. Father God, thank you for delivering my daughter and granddaughter to your house. Father God, Lord, they are in desperate need of prayer. So, we come together to anoint them in the name of Jesus. Father God, to cast out all demonic spirits, Father God. That you will touch them, Father, from the top of their head to the bottom of their feet, Father God. We know that you're able, Lord. - Let's go, Kai. Kai. Kai. - Deliver them, Father. Deliver them. Lose the demon out of them in the name of Jesus! In the name... - Lord! Don't run from the Lord. - It's all right, Sister Charlotte. You tried, you tried. Don't run from the Lord. Thank you, Lord. What's wrong with Granny? How dare you embarrass me? I am trying to help you. You need Jesus. I don't think Jesus is what you're offering. Don't blast me. I am not responsible for how you turned out. So, the way I turned out had nothing do with you drinking all the time? Granny, stop! - Come on. - Turquoise. Baby. Turquoise, I'm... Oh, Jesus. Make sure you smile. I can see the concentration on your face. "I'm a woman "phenomenally. Phenomenal woman, "that's me." Miss Jones, I want that poem memorized immediately. It was lovely seeing her doing the same poem you did. I remember what an orator you were and how beautifully you performed it. I owe that to you. You introduced me to Dr. Angelou's words. That and pay for my pageant fees. I had high hopes for you, Turquoise. I wish I'd gotten to you sooner. Can't change the past, I suppose. Of course not. We just have to focus on the future. All I smell is burnt hair. This is just for your dress rehearsal. You need to sign this for me. You need some help around here, and I can pay for stuff, like dancing. I worked when I was 15 'cause I had to. You barely made it this year without having to go to summer school. Mama, you ain't even finished school. I don't even know why I have to do Juneteenth. Didn't do nothing for you. When I was a kid, I used to go to the pageant every year, dreaming that one day I'd be up there. And the girls that won looked like they were floating. And they had all this hope and promise. I felt that when I won. Like, I mean, I was walking into a new life. I still didn't believe I actually won. A girl from where I'm from didn't win Miss Juneteenth. That scholarship made me feel like I finally had a chance. My life could have been different if, um... If I would have stuck with it. That's what I want for you. Oh, child. Come on now. That's the last one. - Oh, Lord. - Here we go. Solomon, says he's tired of me working. He's gonna take me off of my feet. You're gonna spend the rest of your days pushing his old behind around. His old behind gets a Social Security check. Ain't no retirement at Wayman's. You just work till your legs fall off. Wayman's. Boy, stop playing. What you mean? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Oh, Lord. Okay, okay. All right. Come on, Turq. - We gotta go. Now. - What's going on? We're doing everything we can. With a heart attack like this, it's really up to the patient. Call your daddy again. I have, like, 100 times. Why don't you try? You think I would have asked you if I hadn't? I need a favor. I don't have the rest of the money, but I can put some more down on it. I told you, we don't do credit and we don't do layaway. You see, I just need it for tonight. I can bring the dress back in the morning. I rushed to get it ready. It's 6:00. I close at 6:00. I already paid the deposit. Mrs. Cee, please. Together. And turn in sync. Lovely. Lovely, ladies. To your positions. Watch your spacing. Lovely. Beautiful smiles, ladies. Lovely turn. In sync. Lovely. Nicely done. And next, moving on. Young lady, your turn. - What? - Stay. What the hell are you doing? Where were you? And where's your car? You told me to park down the street. Hmm. What you gonna do with that? Where's the money? You know I had to pay some of that restitution. We waited three hours. What good imma be if I'm back in jail, huh? All them girls in their pretty dresses, and she had to walk the fucking stage in her shorts. She don't even want to do this. No sense in spending all that money on her dress. My money. Where's the rest? Turq. My homeboy... he put his body shop up for sale. He throwing in his tools and everything. I couldn't pass that up. I could open up my own custom shop. Think about all the things I can do. Once that take off... I'll get her that dress. And I'm gonna help you, too. I just need... I just need... Just gotta give me just a little time. Turq, just enough time to pay you back. Imma pay you back. Daddy, just go. Let her be. Mama, get up. Come on, get up. Let's practice. We can take these old ruffles off and put some more sequins on it. "Now you understand just why my head's not bowed. "I don't shout or jump about "or have to talk real loud. "When you see me passing, it ought to make you proud." We're having that dance for Wayman tonight. All the proceeds go to his medical bills. Hey, little lady. Go put your dress on. I'll be fine. I promise. I won't do nothing. You should go. Mmm. Okay, fine, I'll go next door. Okay. I'll walk you over there. Check, check, check. Everybody, what's up? Y'all put in the bucket what ya'll can, give a hand to Mr. Wayman. As good as he's been to us, let's be good to him.

Girl, what the hell are you doing? I lay down for five minutes... And you run my bar into the ground. Put them liquors back so we can open up. Can't make no money closed. I gotta get to the barbecue pit - so that we can get started. - Wayman. What? I gotta get to the barbecue pit. Come on, sit down. I've been giving my whole life to this bar. When I was laid up, thought about it long and hard. I'm gonna have to go down to the city, see what the white folks gonna give me for her. No. You know I could run this thing with my eyes closed. I know. But with the medical bills piling up, I can't afford to keep on going. I've thought about that, too. Oh, no, child.
