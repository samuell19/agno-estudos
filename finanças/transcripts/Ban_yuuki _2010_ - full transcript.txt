"Long, long ago… To the east of the continent, like a raindrop, was the island country of Horai." "On the continent was Kada, a land of great culture and learning." "To study this culture and build a new tomorrow, came four young men of Horai." KINO UKINA OTOTSU NO KARAMARO KYOGANE SHIRABE DATE NO DOMON "Waiting in Kada was new learning, culture, and religion." "After five years, the day neared when they would return home." AN OBSERVATORY IN KADA Hey, look at that! -A falling star? -Not just one. Whoa, there's tons of them! There won't be any stars left in the sky. This is a meteor shower. I've read about them. -Huh? -In the chronicles. There's enough there to make everyone's wish come true. What? A wish made while a star falls will come true. That's what they say here. Nonsense! I haven't seen a shower this big for quite a while. Sensei! Kyogane Shirabe… Kino Ukina… Ototsu no Karamaro… Date no Domon… It's already been five years since you came here from far Horai. You have learned well. Thank you. Our ship leaves in three days. We should be home in a month. Horai is still young. With what we have learned here, we will build a new land there. We will not forget your kindness. Good. Well then, a final test. Yes, sir! How do you interpret this shower of falling stars? Is it an omen of good, or an omen of ill? How would you advise the king? Advise the king to brace himself for trouble. Oh? Why? The chronicles tell of such a shower during the reign of an earlier king. Taking it as a warning from the gods, the people were terrified… and there was unrest. Hm… And the rest of you? Karamaro? I agree with Shirabe. Hm… And you, Ukina? Ukina! Uh… Well, something like that. Domon. Yes, sir. I believe the king should be pleased. You do? Hearts and minds mean more than the movement of stars. It is the acts of men that make the stars move. This shower is heaven's warning of unrest. The king will gladly seize this chance to mend where his rule is torn. He will be seen as a worthy king, and the fires of unrest will die away. So he should use this to control the people's hearts? Not "control." Forge a path. A path for hearts and minds to follow. Very good, Domon. You've read my mind! -What? -Forge your path according to divine will! Just what I was thinking. Well done, Domon. Very good! You've been ripped off, Domon. Looks that way. That old fossil's going to the king pretending your idea was his. That's why I didn't tell him what I thought. -You hadn't a clue! -Shut up. You've got to watch that greedy old man. At least now the king will hear it. That's a lesson well-learned. Seriously? We left our country and came here to learn, and not just from books. My, my. How magnanimous you are… What do you expect of a commoner? Now that's enough! Oh-ho! Taking your future brother-in-law's side, are you? -Hey! -Domon! Don't get all puffed up just because Miss Mikoto's your fiancée. Right! Without her family you'd never have even gotten in the palace, let alone be sent to Kada. Karamaro! I know that. -Do you now? -Stop it, Ukina. Let's go, Karamaro. Go where? We leave in three days. We have goodbyes to say. To this one… and that one. Come on. -Pay no mind to their words. -I know. They're worried. They haven't really studied much. I know. -And Domon… -Hm? Do well by my sister. What? I swore on those meteors… that when I return home I'll take on that palace bunch. Shake the place up. What? Horai can't go on like before. It's only since I've come here that I've realized… how out-of-date our nobles are. No matter what knowledge we bring back… the country won't improve as long as they're in charge. Be patient, Shirabe! No, I've made up my mind. -I have a new weapon. -A weapon? Yes. What we've studied here the most. The teachings of Ban… That's right. A new religion we don't have in our country. With that we'll win over the people. But Domon… if Mikoto gets between me and my father, she'll be hurt. -So you must protect her. -Shirabe! You're the only one I can rely on. You're choosing a hard road. It can't be helped. I've made up my mind. I'm counting on you, Domon. Shirabe? Hey. What's wrong? Shirabe? Hey… What's the matter? Shirabe! Shirabe! Shirabe! Who did this to you?! Shirabe! Hang in there! Domon… Shirabe… Shirabe! What's going on here?! You bastard! -What did you do?! -No, it wasn't me! The Horai scholars had a falling out? No, that's not it! Tell it to the king! I said I didn't do it! Let go of me! What are you do-- Shirabe! Shirabe! Let go of me! Let go! Come along! Shirabe… Shirabe! Move! We are saddened, young scholar. Why do such a thing to your companion? It wasn't me, Your Majesty! Watch your mouth! Domon, I'm disappointed. What have you learned from me? Sensei… Bring the witnesses. Ukina, Karamaro! Thank goodness. Set them straight, will you? Our malevolent god, Ban, rules all the heavens and earth. What Ban wishes is truth. What Ban hates is lies. He who speaks falsehood in this trial will be cast down into Hell. Is that understood? Yes. Ban is in every heart! Ban is everywhere! Ban is in every heart! Ban is everywhere! Answer in the name of Ban. Who raised his hand against your companion Kyogane Shirabe? Was it that man? Go on, tell them. I'd never do that. It was him. No mistake about it. Both of us saw clearly as he raised his sword and slew… our companion, Kyogane Shirabe. What are you talking about?! Don't be difficult, Domon. Accept the inevitable. No! It wasn't me! I didn't do it! Listen! They're lying! Why would I kill my best friend?! He opposed your marriage to his sister. He told us that. You found out, lost your temper, and killed him. Nonsense! That would never happen! Where's your proof? Your Majesty, this was found in Domon's room. -What language is this? -Allow me. It is the language of Horai. It seems to be addressed to Shirabe's father. "Do not allow Domon to marry my sister," it says! Nonsense! It's a forgery! You know, Shirabe did say that he was writing to his father… So this bastard stole that letter… …then silenced Shirabe? How could you?! I'm being framed! They did this! Lying like that before the king! Have you no shame?! Silence, Domon! How despicable, Domon! And he was your old friend! I was going to ask His Majesty for mercy, but… I suppose a man of low birth is a man of low morals. "The sparrow will never soar like the crane." What a shame this is. This is. You barefaced liars! His guilt seems clear. Damn you! You swine! Varlet! Learn your place! Damn you! Sentence this man to the island. Not to death? By the law of Kada, foreigners are sent to Prison Isle. Yes, Your Majesty. Court is adjourned. Remove that man from our palace immediately. Yes, Your Majesty. You have done well… Kino Ukina… Ototsu no Karamaro… You are fine young men of Horai. We are pleased. Name your reward. In that case… In that case? Declare us the only ones who may spread the teachings of Ban in Horai. Only the two of you? Yes. Only the two of us. Yeah, yeah, yeah… Good, that's it. Shut up! Put a cork in it! You dimwits, scum, baldies! You're all useless swine! And you stink! Like, you really stink! Hey, what are you doing? Stay there! Stay! Quit fooling around! Dimwit baldies. Tote that bag! Dimwits, scum, baldies! Move it! The convict ship has arrived. Who is it today? A man from Horai. Oh, the one who killed his friend… Yes. Unhand me! I'm innocent! Shut up! It was a trap! They framed me! Keep quiet! Don't give us trouble. Kino Ukina… Ototsu no Karamaro… I will never forget your names. I will carve rage and hatred into my heart! Whatever happens, I will-- No talking! No talking! Forget those idle vows. No one gets off Prison Isle alive. For the rest of your life… we own you. I swear I will return to Horai! No matter what, I will pay them back for Shirabe and for this betrayal! Remember that! No! Lord Kurando! Miss Mikoto! Has the ship from Kada arrived? Yes. It just docked. No storms, they say. It seems it was a quiet voyage. So my brother has come home safe, then? Yes. The officials just went on board. They should be out soon. You'll be wanting to see Domon. Who, me? Don't pretend. We Men-at-Arms are all proud of Domon. He went from the Guards to being sent abroad as a scholar. He's going to change this country. I firmly believe that. As he said to me… "I trust a man I can trust." Yes, that's really true. But it's been five years. Will we recognize him? I will. I'm the one who found him. Out of all those guards, only he had eyes like the sky itself. Much as someone might change… those eyes never will. What can I say to that? Oh, here they come. Ukina! Karamaro! Oh, Kurando. How have you been? And Miss Mikoto! You're lovelier than ever. Where are the others? The others? Yes. My brother and Lord Domon. I'm afraid only the two of us have returned. What? Miss Mikoto… please stay calm and listen. Your brother Shirabe… was killed. -What?! -What'd you say?! Date no Domon killed him. Never! Why would he do such thing?! We'll talk later. It's been a long voyage. We'll talk later… of what a villain Domon was. I don't believe this! I'm afraid it's true. He turned on his friend. He was a man risen from the ranks. Just like you. I'll be in touch, Miss Mikoto. Brother! Lord Domon! "Far out at sea from Horai rises Prison Isle." "This small island to the south of Kada… is isolated year-round by angry seas. No one has ever escaped this demons' island." "Date no Domon, an innocent man, has now spent ten long years here." Save me! Scared, new guy? Of course not! Well, I'm not surprised. No one sent to this island ever leaves it again. You'd want to weep and wail, too. Don't worry. They quiet down when there's food. Oh, right! But be careful of the guy in that cell. He's a special case. Let your guard down with him and you'll pay for it. For giving him food? Watch out or you'll end up like me. He's the one who took my eye. That was ten years ago now. I was putting him in his cell when he got my eyeball… and gouged it out. What?! Ten years? Did you say ten years? Has it been ten years already? That's right. Ten years. Ten years since you ate my damn eyeball! Seriously?! Yeah, that's right! Your eyeball tasted great! -Next I'll get that kid's. -What?! -Will you give me a nice, young eye? -N-No way! Shuddup! These moldy buns suit you fine! Get back! Back! -Now! -Okay! No! Jeez, he's crazy through and through. -Come on. To the next one. -Okay. -Not that way, fool! -What? -Come here. -Okay. -Hurry. Come quick. -Okay. -Listen. -Sir. And listen good. Never open that door back there. You must never… enter there. Why not? -There's a monster in there. -What?! Let sleeping dogs lie. Worse than this one? This one's just crazy. Quiet you! The one back there isn't even human. Never go in there. Okay. -Good, come on. -Right. Wait for me, sir! Are you chicken? No! -I'm right behind you! -Okay. Who could possibly have a taste for eyeballs? I'll never get used to this garbage. So I'm mad, am I? That would be easier. But I'm still clear as a bell in my head. Kino Ukina… Ototsu no Karamaro… I need only remember those names, and my sanity returns. I will have revenge. And I will avenge my dead friend Shirabe. To do that, I will become a demon of Hell. Feigning madness… is just the start. Can you hear me? Hey! Yes. Like you said, the ground's gotten softer. I'm almost there. Soon I'll be through. Then I'll be outside this cell, where I've dreamed of being. I don't know who you are… but you told me about the passage under here. I'm grateful. Yes. Just a little more. All that's left is to do it. I did it! I made it to the underground passage! It's a dead end… It's a dead end! Damn! Damn! I've been tricked! No, this is the spot. It is? Yes. You've opened the door to freedom. There's a chain on the left wall. Pull on it. Hey. We meet at last. That voice… Are you the one who's been talking to me all this time? It's lucky there's a gap in the rocks. It helped to wile away the boredom. Boredom? -Is that why you tricked me? -Tricked you? You said there was a way out down here. So I dug and dug. I dug for a year, but all I find is you. You just wanted my help. But you've got it wrong! No one cheats me and gets away with it. Like your friends from home who framed you ten years ago, right? They're no friends! They're my bitter enemies. Oh, yes. You've told me many times. And I said I sympathized, and that I'd help you get out. Help me? How is this helping?! Did you hear about the killer who assassinated the king? -Killer? -Everyone in here is talking about it. Oh, him… He killed a thousand men before they captured him… Was that you? Yep. That was me. Once I'm free, I'll make short work of the guards here. No more tunneling. Getting off the island will be easy. But hurry. Soon the guards will be making their rounds. They'll see your cell is empty. -What is it? -Oh, nothing. Do I not look very fierce? No, I've never seen a killer with such a nice, bright smile. I get that a lot. They all ask if I could at least look meaner as I kill them. Ridiculous, huh? No, it's entirely reasonable. -Man, that feels better! Thanks! -Hey! You're trying to test me? That's a mistake. Try me… Cheat me… Betray me… All those who do any one of them end up dead. I thought you were about to flat out kill me just now. You attacked knowing you were no match. I never took you for a fool. I was testing my luck. If you're going to kill me here, I'll never have vengeance. I took a gamble. Oh? You're interesting. Then I'll bet on your luck, too. Those aren't regular guards! -An alarm sounded as soon as I broke free. -What? Supposedly they can handle me. Here! Take your destiny in your own hands! I'm going home! I swear I will! I will not let myself die… Not here! Now, come! Very good! You've got a good arm. But now let me show you how to kill. A spoon. Through a gap into the heart. That kills. A sash. You crush the windpipe. That kills. Fingers. Through the eyes into the brain. That kills. Of course, the sword… and the spear. They easily kill a man. That's amazing! Any man alive can be killed. It just takes will and technique. I could teach you. Uh, okay… Come. The ship's that way. The ship? Aren't we leaving? The dock's over there. Oh, right… We have to hurry. The tide's going out. What's your name? Should I not ask? Let's see… Call me, "Spoon." -Spoon? -Yeah. You've got us this far digging with a spoon. And now I'll take you the rest of the way. You? What's most in your way when you want to do something? People… with different ideas. I'll eliminate the people in your way. Like you did these guys? That's what I do. I will take revenge on those who made you what you are now. That I swear. What I am now? Is this me? After only ten years? You'll really help me? You gave me freedom. I have to pay you back. Your words sound to me like a candle in the dark. But a breeze will blow a candle out. If you blow out that easily, then leave now. Deceive me and I'll send you straight to Hell! I'm not sure but I think I get your drift. Listen… The prisoners must sense something wrong. -Is that…? -What? I want to check something before we go. -We have no time for odd creatures. -Darakan? Come on! Okay. I'll open it. You understand her? -I'll do it. It'll be faster. -Okay. Kiss! -No… Okay, I get it. -Kiss! -It won't hurt! -Not the point! What are you doing?! Freeze! Hold it right there! Hold it! Yeah! A jailbreak. Call the others. -Yes, sir! -Don't move-- Thanks… for everything. Penanju. Garandon! Penanju! -Penanju! -Garandon! I guess I'll kill him. Wait! Please! I'm here to save her! That's why I joined the guards. We won't bother you. Hey, how do you… I speak your language a little. Ey! Hey, you're fluent! -Spoon, she's coming, too. -She's dead weight… -No. She holds the key to my vengeance. -What? Believe it or not, she's a Haman princess. A princess?! Garan! Over here! Rokurokudon! Penanju! A friend. She has a boat! Come this way! Let's go, Spoon! Thinking ahead, are you? You may be more capable than I thought! "Domon and Spoon, together with the Haman princess, make their escape from Prison Isle." ONE YEAR LATER LAND OF HORAI, DOKATSU MANSION Though in this world We will never meet In dreams I see you constantly And must die of longing Devoted to you Body and soul You come to me in dreams Magnificent! Splendid! Splendid! Hey! What's your name? The girl does not speak… Lord Dokatsu. What? Katashiro, the capital's finest dancing girl… It is well known she has cut out her tongue as an offering to the Gods of the Dance. Of course, as the Head Priest of Ban… thou shalt pray to no other god but mine! I should be angry at your foolishness… but am prepared to overlook it in a girl so pretty. There you go singing your praises! It's my nature. Well, since you've managed to spread the teachings of Ban so well… I won't get angry. But I am! What? Which is it? I'm angry… but I keep it in. I'm an adult. How admirable! Not for nothing are you Baron of Barons… second only to the king! A fine adult! Shut up, you old geezer! -No, I mean-- -Father… Thank you very much for inviting us today. Well… you're doing a lot for me, Karamaro. With this Ban racket of yours… the people give us money we call "offerings." Makes things easier for me. Dear me, Lord Dokatsu. -"Racket" is such an ugly word. -Oh? -This all comes from the teachings of Ban. -Oh my. You offer all you have to Ban. The more that is worth, the more you are cleansed. Is this all not written in the scriptures? Oh, of course! It is, isn't it?! How silly of me! Such wit from the Baron of Barons, second only to the king! Stop laughing, you old geezer! Father, this is why I told you not to come! You don't even have an official rank! But there's free food… And you've eaten, so go home! Aw, man! I've got work to do! Why won't you leave me alone? Okay! We're done here! .As the king's Junior Minister, I am busy! No! Oh, all right! Wait in the garden. I'll just greet the big-nose old man. -Aw! -Hurry back! Right, I will. Take care. Okay! Yay! Who are you calling "big-nose" with hair like that?! Oh man, you're in a bad mood again, huh, Dad? No, no! He's been in a fine mood. I don't know… what's come over the greatest man in the land next to the king. Now see here! I'm sick of all this "next to the king," you old fool! Get outta here! I'm far greater than that insipid king! The one who moves things in Horai is me… Baron of Barons, Kino Dokatsu! How many times must I say it?! -Be gone! Dimwit, scum, baldy! -Father! Go home! Your old man's still as loony as ever. A reverse role model. I studied relentlessly so as not to end up like him. That's how I got where I am. Plus by leaving a friend behind. You thought he was a friend? Of course not! A clod like that ruining a very important banquet for me! But I am Dokatsu! I love everyone around me! You there, dancing girl! Marry me! -Don't mind him. It's all bravado. -Everyone! I will make everyone with me happy! What's that king good for, anyway?! Well now, it's time for our call and response segment! Are you really going to do it?! Okay, I'll say, "What's he good for…" and you shout out, "…anyway?!" I mean it. Let's practice. What's he good for… …anyway?! We don't continue until you get it right! No more scenes! Sorry to those who haven't appeared! Here we go. What's he good for… …anyway?! Yes. What's he good for… Good! No lip-synching in the balconies! Okay, over here! Let me hear you! Whoops! Can't see. Here goes! Don't be shy! Let's go! What's he good for… …anyway?! -Louder! What's he good for… -…anyway?! All together now! We're making memories tonight! Ready?! What's he good for… …anyway?! -Last time! What's he good for… -…anyway?! Thank you! Applause! -Thank you! -Okay… With my dad in good spirits again, we will disperse. Disperse! On that note… Wait, Ukina. -We need to talk. -Make it quick! I've got plans. It concerns "the True Ban." The True Ban? What's that? A new form of Ban. It appeared in the west six months ago, and has rapidly spread. There are preaching halls even here. Ridiculous. We're the only two here who know the teachings. Well, I'm sure it's a fraud. However… -That damn king is interested in it. -He is? He just loves anything new. He has no idea how much work I've done spreading Ban… and getting people to provide money and labor. We've got to do something about that brat… but first, the True Ban. Do what's necessary to stop it. I will. But first things first. More womanizing?! Stop hurting your wife! Hey now! When have I hurt her? I wouldn't do that! Unbelievable… Oh! I think your plans have fallen through. Get back here! Take this! Oh no you don't! You aren't getting away from me! Get going! Get out! Lord Ukina! -She's scary! -Huh?! Who is… …that old bag?! Uh, well… Who's an old bag?! Take this! You think I'll stand here and take that?! Here goes! Lady Shikame, stop it! Oh, my! Hello, Father-in-law! What are you doing? I was walking in the garden and these women were out back. I asked who they were here to see, and they said… believe it or not, a gentleman named Kino Ukina… had made arrangements to meet them there. As it so happens, I believe my husband… is named Kino Ukina… But of course my dear husband would never do such a thing! Believing that someone had assumed my husband's name… I brought them here. But that man right over there… …is Lord Ukina. You be quiet, all of you! I won't have it! Lord Ukina! And who would you be? You shouldn't be here. Leave immediately. Guards! Wait Lord Ukina! Show them out. What?! How dare you come in here like that. Leave! We'll have to find out who's been using my name. Lady Shikame… Ukina still has work to discuss with Karamaro. Out of respect for me, calm yourself. Now, there's fruit over there. Please have some. Instead of fruit, I'd rather have… saké. If you write "woman," "crotch," and "power" as one character… you get "hard work"! You really ham it up, don't you? You're on tape. Guards! Sir! Get her a urine test. Yes, sir! All you'll get is farts! You see, Karamaro? I don't hurt her. She hurts me. You really got a bad wife. You're the one who chose her! Of course! She's from a powerful clan! I needed a blood connection to give me weight in the palace! Then you should've married her! That was your original plan, wasn't it?! Then once you saw her you stuck me with her. I was shocked. I went up to introduce myself as her new step-son, and you said, "Here's the groom." Well, I'd never seen her, either! I just wanted money! Who'd marry her? So you stuck her on me?! If you don't suffer now you'll regret it later. That's not right… Oh well! If you can't get the woman you want, at least get the money. Quiet, Karamaro. Mikoto was the one woman you couldn't get. But now you can afford all the young girls you want. Karamaro… Old friend or not, you've gone too far. Huh? His dad's not the only clod here. Wait! Don't! -She's been listening to us! -A spy! Woman! You're not so small as to escape my eyes! Yet you didn't see me! My son's eyes are mine! Guards! After her! Bring her back… alive. Yes, sir! She's trailing blood. She won't get away. I'll examine her… thoroughly. Always a softy on the ladies. My prior plans fell through. But who sent her? We know who it is! The would-be Baron of Barons. Lord Sekishun, the Senior Minister? Don't call him "Lord"! I thought he was finished after his son Shirabe died… but he's relentless. Well, we'll find out once we catch the woman. And I'll handle the True Ban. You do that. You are more relentless than Sekishun, Milord. Indeed. I can't have that feeble old man catching at my heels, can I? Damn! You aren't getting away, woman! You won't take me that easily. -Let go! -Not a chance! Hm? Stand. Get back. Huh? The dancer! Go away. You'll get hurt. Oh will I? Whoa, she spoke! So she's… a man?! Why, you…! Now that you know… your life is over. Who are you? Are you all right, Nishiki? Lord Sekishun! I put you in danger. I'm sorry. No. Ukina is a dullard, but he is alert, and I was careless. I'm sorry. Just as long as you're safe. Toi! Sir! You did well in saving her. Though you killed too many. I apologize. Um… Who is he? The dancer Katashiro is a front. His name is Toi. Why was he here? Didn't you trust me? They found you, didn't they? He doesn't work for my sake alone. He just happened to be here. You are my eyes and ears, Nishiki. Don't be offended. Yes, Milord. And what is Lord Dokatsu up to? As expected, he will not be obedient to the king's wishes. Rather, he considers the king an obstacle. The fool! We have peace at last, and he wants to upset things with a power struggle? He is also… concerned about the True Ban. -The True Ban? -Yes. That new religion from the west? Yes, that is a worry. Nishiki, you're hurt! It's nothing. We must get back and have that looked at. -Milord, you mustn't! -Just get on. Thank you. I'll be going then. Right. See to the king. You can count on me. Come if you're hungry The True Ban will feed you with hot gruel Don't push, don't push! There's lots Don't rush, don't rush While you eat your broth Hear a few words from our Head Priest Fill your stomach with broth And your soul with his words We only ask but a little time And now what you've been waiting for! The Head Priest of the True Ban, Lord Hito-Ban! -Do you hunger? -Yes! -Are you empty? -Yes! Then eat your fill of rice broth. Eat for your whole life! The pot of the True Ban will never be empty. And why not? Because this pot is the Pot of God. It is a pot of miracles! That's a lie. There is no such pot. It is but a normal pot that this pot-maker made and we bought. Why is there always more? Because there are bags of rice behind our temple. A huge pile of bags of rice. There is no miracle. It is perfectly natural. But who grew that rice, then? You did. Every one of you. You flooded the paddies, planted the seeds, and harvested it. It's all perfectly natural. But… it is precisely that which is the m
