Daddy's head is stuck. Unstick Daddy's head. - [Groaning] - Dad, can you knock? - Knock? I thought I heard screaming in here. - No. No, you didn't, Dad. Well, it could've been that crack I smoked earlier, I guess. - Yeah. - Yeah, that's what it was. I gotta leave town for a couple of days. No big deal. Just that new business I started with those Colombian guys? - Oh, you mean Uncle Escobar. - Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Well, there's a problem. Some money went missing. And apparently, some legs are gonna get broken. It's just better if I lay low for a couple of days. - If the cops raid the place... - I never heard of you. - And don't forget... - To flush your stash. Oh, you are my little girl. I love you so much... that I left you a little something in the coffee can. - Dad... - But you have to remember to step on it before you sell it. - Now, what are you gonna cut it with? - Um, baking... Baking soda. Not baking powder. Because baking powder guys will have muffins growing out of their nose. You love that joke, don't you, honey? You've loved that joke since you were two years old. - Okay, well... - Okay, I love you. - I love you. - Have a good trip. - Bye. - Bye. Whew! Is the coast clear? Oh, Cindy, that nightgown. That was close. God! I was, uh, home watching The Exorcist, and it got me thinking about you. If this is about the time I puked green slime and masturbated with a crucifix... It was my first keg party, Bobby. No. No. Uh, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out. So you thought you would just climb through my window... and we would play bump-bump? I was kind of hoping to get my balls licked, but I wouldn't wanna break your little underwear rule, now, would I? So maybe just some on-top-of-the-clothes type stuff? Okay. But just for a minute. [Soft Rock] What the... Wrong set. Bobby! Oh, Bobby! I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over - No, Bobby, don't. - Ow! Jeez. Yeah, my dad. Okay, stud, you have to go now. Oh, um, about the sex stuff? I was only half serious. I don't wanna rush you or anything. Hey, would you settle for PG-13? What's that? Oh, jeez! - [Crash] - Good night, Bobby. - [Laughing] - Shorty, you are so loud. And make sure you take your behind to class today. - I do be going to class. - Lunch is not a class, Shorty. It is when you got the munchies. - See, that's why you such a dumb-ass. - Your mother. You my brother. That's your mother too, jackass. Oh, yeah. Well, then, your fathers stupid. So?

Anyway, everybody was drinking Cristal champagne. And then it started to get wild, and people were getting freaky in the pool and stuff. I look over and there was your girl getting buck wild in the Jacuzzi. So? With a backup dancer. I mean, that's nasty. That's-That's lower than the security guard. At least security can get you backstage. She don't love herself. Bye, Daddy. - I don't know. II think Buffy's sweet, Brenda. She is as fake as Press-onnails. Hey, baby girl! What is up, my sister? - Bye, Mr. Gilmore. - Bye! - Is he gone? - Yep. Do you like what you see It's all about the money [Girl] Hey, Cindy! - I love this color. - Let me see that. - Oh, you guys should not use this brand. - Why not? - Because they test their products on animals. - So? Look, have you seen what they do to those poor animals? Well, I am much more of a people person. I'd like to feed all the hungry, little children of the world. I'd much rather help my fellow man than some animal. - Spare a dollar? - Get away from me, you bum! Buffy! Can't you see he's just hungry? Here you go, sir. A nice sandwich. - See? - I said a dollar, bitch! Ow! God. Look at this place. It's a circus. Hello. I'm Gail Hailstorm, author of the book, You're Dead, llmmm Rich. A small college town is in shock... after the unthinkable has happened: a brutal killing spree that left one teen dead... - That's it. Two teens dead... - [Gunshot] And this small town shaken and stirred. - Its times like these... - Police are combing the area for clues. There are no witnesses available at this time. There are no suspects in custody. Police are asking anyone to come forward. Reporting live for Black TV. White folks are dead and were getting the fuck out of here! Grab your shit and lets go, motherfucker! Hey, do you think the press is gonna wanna talk to us? Oh, girl, no. The press only wants to interview the most ignorant person they can find. I'm on TV! Oh, shit! First Cops, now this! Oh, man, I'm gonna be a star, son! - What can you tell us about Drew? - Well, she had the fat ass. - I mean, it was like bang! - How close were you to the victim? Real close. Until the roofies wore off. Then she woke up talking about pressing charges. So I just pulled my tongue out of her ass and left. What would have been your last words to Drew? Run, bitch! Run! Hey, yo, dawg. Does this shirt make me look gay? No, man. What about now? - Nah. Yeah. - Cool? Here. Take one, guys. Don't forget: elections Tuesday. Don't forget: election's Tuesday. Ah!

[Bobby] Hey, guys. - Hey, Bobby. - Hey, baby. - How you doing? - Good. - You guys see all the reporters out there? - Yeah. Saying that girl Drew Decker got killed last night. - You know what? I think I knew her. - Really? - She had a brother named Steve? - Yeah. Long hair, pretty little mouth, perfect ass? - That was her. - Nah, I was talking about Steve. Whatever happened to him? Do you guys think its strange that she got killed... exactly one year after we, you know, killed that guy? Hey, Cindy, that was an accident. Was it, Greg? [Greg] Yeah! [Laughing] Would you look at what they're doing? When are we gonna do stuff like that, huh? One day. - You like that, baby? - Yeah, that's different. - You like that? - Oh, I love that.

I think we hit something. Oh, man! Bobby, look at my car, man! My dads gonna freak! [Bobby]I didn't see it. It came out of nowhere. - Oh, my God, we hit a boot. - Where's the foot? I don't know. Where the... - [Screams] - Its a body! - Oh, shit, is he alive? - I don't know. - Well, check it out. - I cant. - Shit! - We have to call the police. - No way. I ain't going to jail. - We have to! Cindy, do you know what they do to young boys in prison? And all those sex-starved convicts just waiting for a fresh piece of meat. Hey, you're right, Cindy. Maybe we should call the police. [Greg]Oh, yeah, That's a great idea, Ray. But what about Brenda, huh? You think she wants to go to jail? This is manslaughter, okay? Were all gonna fry for this. - Were looking at 10 to 15 years. - Shut up, Bobby! - Its okay. I'm fine. - Alcohol all over. - We're in so much trouble. - I'm fine. -[Brenda]Don't blame that shit on me, Ray. - Look, well get rid of the body. - Unnecessary. -[Brenda]Now you're thinking. - We'll dump him in the ocean. - Not the ocean, the pier. - Guess I'll be leaving now. - [Greg] That's a great idea. - What about the alcohol? - Well get rid of it. [Bobby]Come on. It'll be all right. - Come on. Hurry up. Lets go. - Put him in the trunk. - I wont have anything to do with this! - [Greg]Shut up! Cindy, come on. Well just pretend it never happened. You know, like the time we got drunk and we went down on each other. - I'll get his arm. - I'll grab. I'll grab his other arm. His ass. Well take him down to Williamson Cove and we'll dump him in there. The sharks'll take care of the evidence. Oh, my God, someone's coming. - Oh, shit. Its Shorty. - Brenda, take care of him. [Rap Playing On Radio] Shorty, I know you ain't driving without no papers. I got papers, blunts, bongs, all the ingredients to make a high niggard pie. - Hey, yo, can I help you? - Yo, what's up, Ray? - Yo, son, you all need jumper cables? - Nah, were cool. Oh, good, cause I left my roach clip at home. - Go home, Shorty. - Yeah, I-I'll see you later. Peace, Ray. - Get the trunk closed. - [Buffy]It won't close. - I'll do it. - [Groaning] [Shorty Laughing] Hold on. Hold on. Put him down. He's heavy. Oh, God. Okay, look. On three we dump him over the ledge. Wait, wait, wait. Shouldn't we at least check his wallet? - For what? - Shit, he might have some money. We already committed murder. We might as well rob his ass. - I'll take the credit cards. - I want his jewelry. - I'm gonna take his drawers. - [All Shouting] - Get off! Hey, yo, get off! His drawers are mine! Yo! - [Chuckling] I got me a gold ring. - Credit cards. - All right, lets get him in the water. - I don't think I can, Greg. - Its not too late. - Shut up, okay? - Christ, already. I'll do it. - Just get him in the water. Okay. One, two, three. Right now we make a pact. We take this to our grave. - Agreed? - Agreed. - Agreed. - Agreed? - [Brenda, Bobby] Agreed. Say it, Cindy. Say it! We take this to our grave. Say it! - [Gagging] - We take this to our grave. Say it. Greg, chill. Come on. You're hurting her. We take this to our grave. Ow. And we never mention this again.

Just touch it again. Come on. Please. - You have to move on, Cindy. That's all behind us now. - Exactly. - Its a coincidence. - Gregss right, Cindy. I mean, what do you think were in, a horror movie? Yeah, you guys are right. If we were, they'd probably cast some dingbat like Jennifer Love Huge Tits to play me. Yeah, or they'd cast people in their late twenties, early thirties to play us. -[Bell Rings] - Kenny, get the camera ready. Here. Hold my gum. - Sheriff, Sheriff, can I get a statement? - No comment.

Ray, if you see Bobby, tell him I love him. Okay. If I see Bobby, I'll tell him I love him. - Jesus! - Its okay. It's all right. It's just me, baby. - What, you don't still think It's me, do you? - No. It's just that somebody did try to kill me. - And the police said I scared him away. - I know. He called me last night. You see, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail last night. Remember? You're the best. I'm sorry. Please understand. Understand what? That my girlfriend would rather call me a killer than touch me? - That's not true, Bobby. - Then what is it? What is it? She's gone and she's not coming back. - Its been over a year, Cindy. - But Ginger was such an important part of the Spice Girls. - Oh, you gotta move on, baby. - Oh! I'm sorry if my complicated life... is an inconvenience to your perfect existence. Cindy. Cindy. [Sheriff] Okay, everybody, listen up.

Feminine odor and itching got you down? Uh, no. No, not that. Then what is it? I have a terrible secret. Well, Cindy, we all have our little secrets. Sometimes we do things were not so proud of. Some for money, others to gain the athletic edge on the competition. Sometimes those secrets come back to haunt us. - Aah! - Do you know what I mean? Yes, I do, um, Miss Mann. Thanks for ball... I mean, all your help. I have to go to class. Anytime, dear. - Buffy, are you coming? - I'll catch up with you guys in a sec. [Man Whispering]Redrum. Hello? Somebody there? Hello! [Gasps] Very funny.
