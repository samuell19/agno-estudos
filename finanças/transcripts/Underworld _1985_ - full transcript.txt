You're improving, Fluke. - You haven't changed a bit, Roy. Still minding the ladies? - (laughing) In a manner of speaking, yeah. - A man with a vocation. Motherskille wants to see you. - Well I don't want to see him. - Ta ta. - Roy, this is a friendly visit for old time's sake. - Yeah, that's right. - And Motherskille will make it worth your while. - Yeah. - What's the parrot called? - That's Darling and this is the scrupulous Mr. Bain of whom you've heard so much. Now once again, the man of the moment. Life's gotten so expensive these days. - I survive. - The old firm's changed, Roy. - I'm not interested. - Don't be difficult. Motherskille's gone to a great deal of trouble to set up this meeting. - Well, he'll have to unset it. Give him a little extra time to spend on his stamp collection. - Oh, you should come. It's about Nicole. (suspenseful ambient music) - Listen, it's been years. I don't move in your world anymore. - Well, you know how it is when Motherskille gets an idea into his head. He was most insistent. - Well, you'll just have to say no. - Ta ta. - My, my. - Bang, bang. - I am in demand, aren't I? Tell your Darling to take the toy away, huh? What's he planning to do, shoot me and carry my corpse to Motherskille? - Nicole's in bad trouble. She needs you, Roy. - Roy! I'm pleased you could come. Hey, Roy, you're looking good. - Clean living. - [Hugo] And a clear conscience? - (chuckling) Since when all this? - Since I've been moving into manufacturing. You are looking at an industrialist, Roy. Clean, straight, 100% for the party. Take a seat. - You're doing well, Hugo. - The just rewards of hard work. I hope we can be friends, Roy. - I don't think so. - Ah, come on, let bygones be bygones. Are we gonna rake over the past or are we going to do some business? Nicole was grabbed last night at Pepperdine's place. A couple of heavy boys went and got her. - So what's it to do with me? - I thought you'd want to know. - Who did it? - If I knew, I wouldn't be fussing and you wouldn't be here. - [Roy] Why am I here? What's wrong with your own people? - My own people are looking. I'm afraid for her. And you're the best. People never change, Roy. They may seem to, but deep down, deep down where it counts, they stay the same. You know the streets. You know the girl. You were fond of her once. Knowledge, talent, and motivation! - Things have changed. - Roy, you do me an injustice. You know what they do to girls like Nicole, huh? They chop her up, and film it, and show it to the psychos. Is that what you want, huh? Tell me, is that what you'd like to see?! Roy, I could show you some things. - Look, it's not my business anymore. - It's not your business anymore. All right, okay, let's forget it. It's all my fault. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Let's forget it. Fluke, give Roy a lift back home, will you? - Okay, okay. - Okay, okay? Good, good. I'll call Pepperdine. She'll give you all the details. Hey, Roy? Some expenses. It's clean, Roy! - Just tell me, why are you doing this? - I owe her one, I owe you one. I don't want to see her come back in bits and pieces. Call it sentiment, if you like. Maybe I can afford to be sentimental now. Take this. If you hear anything, anything at all, any small thing, you call, right? Hey, Roy! You're looking great. (deliberative synth music) (engine rumbling) (tires squealing) (deliberative synth music) (doorbell ringing) - Roy Bain. - Wait here. - Roy. - Bianca. - Well, what brings you here, business or pleasure? - Well, it's certainly not pleasure. I guess you could say I was back working for the man again. - I knew you'd never get it out of your system. How about we celebrate old times? On the house. - Roy, my knight in shining armor. - My lady. - Come along. - You didn't see anything? - Nothing. - Show me her room. What a mess. Something for everyone. - Even you? - (chuckling) I doubt it. - Roy, don't be so hard on yourself. Everyone's got a little fantasy tucked away. - Yeah, but I never quite figured out what mine was. Who were her clients? - Oh, she attracted all kinds. Men who couldn't live with their dreams but wanted to visit them occasionally. She would change for each one. A real artist, Roy, a true talent. - Was she on anything? - Who isn't? - What? - I don't know. It's none of my business. Roy, why are you doing this? Do you have any idea what you're getting involved in? - Like what? - I don't know. I don't want to know. Look, why don't you just go home and forget it? - You're right. But I can't. Do you mind if I look around? - Go ahead. Poor Roy. She's your fantasy. (Bianca faintly singing) ♪ Kiss me baby - Roy, you gave me a fright. It's nice to see you. You should have accepted the offer when it was made. - It's not about that. - Oh? Well, what is it about? - What's wrong? - What do you mean? - Something feels wrong. - Don't tell me, the curtains clash with the wallpaper. - Bianca, why would somebody grab Nicole? What's so special about her? - Maybe they like 'em young. - What's the matter with all of you, huh?! Nobody knows anything, nobody's got any ideas! Not even Pepperdine and she's lying. What's the matter, you scared? - Roy, I don't need this! Listen, Roy, I'm sorry. I do want to help. - What do you know about this? - Try Savary. - Savary? - Nicole used to visit him. - Dr. Savary. Thanks. (footsteps pattering) (man whistling) (machinery squealing) (buzzer buzzing) (machinery beeping) - Yes? - Dr. Savary, I'm a friend of Pepperdine's. - I'm really rather busy at the moment. - It's important. She said you could help. - Wait there please. (machinery beeping) (machinery chugging) Push the door. - Dr. Savary. - I'm sorry, you have me at a disadvantage. - Roy Bain. - I'm very busy at the moment, Mr. Bain. - Well I'm sure it won't take too much time. - How can I help? - I'm looking for a girl. - Yes, I'm sorry, Mr. Bain. I'm a doctor, not a pimp. - (laughing) This was one of Pepperdine's girls, Nicole. - And what is this to do with me? - You had dealings with her. - I'm sorry, Mr. Bain, but as a doctor, I'm not permitted to reveal anything. - Oh, you're much more than just her doctor, doctor. - I don't know what you're talking about. If this is all you've come here for, I'm afraid it's a wasted visit. Now, will you excuse me? - Look what I found in her room. - I know nothing about that, whatever it is. Look, I'm sorry I can't help you, but I'm really very busy. - Do you supply her with this? - Who sent you, Bain?! What do you want? (glass shattering) Stay here. Don't touch anything! (suspenseful ambient music) Mr. Bain, please leave. I'm sorry about your friend. - Nicole. - I really cannot help, please. - I'm sorry to have taken up so much of your precious time, Dr. Savary. (suspenseful ambient music) (eerie synth music) - It should have started. There's no change. There's nothing different about her blood, her skin. Physically, she's completely normal. She is the answer, I know she is. - How much White Man have you given her? - Three shots. She seems to be immune. The dreams don't take root in her. - The way they do in us. Look at her. I'd almost forgotten what beauty was like. She's not here for your amusement! Hey, I want some. - Just a few more tests. - A few drops? - No. - Where am I? - Welcome to the underworld. - Who are you? - I'm Nygaard. - I'm Oriel. - This is Dudu. - But my friends call me shitface. (Oriel laughing) (doors thudding) (suspenseful music) - Where's Red Dog? Where's the White Man? - It's no good. We went to Savary's and something went wrong. Red Dog got out with enough White Man for everyone, but by the time I'd got to him, the dreams had taken over. - Well, where is he now? - I lost him. He'd gone wild! (creature growling) - [Fluke] Come on! Motherskille's very disappointed. You didn't follow orders. - But what's the matter with you? Why don't you believe me? I did, I did, I swear to you. I said exactly what you told me. Why don't you believe me? - Then how come he isn't following them? Last chance, madam. You're lying. Next time you see Bain, you fix it. - Mr. Fluke, I did. I did! How can I make you understand? Why don't you believe me? (slapping) (Pepperdine groaning) - You fix him or we'll fix you. (intense industrial music) (creature growling) (intense industrial music) (creature growling) (intense industrial music) (dog barking) (intense music) (Bianca gasping) (knocking on door) (doorbell ringing) - Roy, I'm frightened. You're in danger. - I am, am I? - There's something going on between Pepperdine and Fluke, something very bad, and that can only mean Motherskille. I'm afraid for you. Listen, Roy, I'm sorry about us arguing. It's just this thing with Nicole, it's horrible. I can't bear the house now. - Do you want a drink? - Can I stay the night? You've always been a gentleman, Roy. You wouldn't throw a young lady out on the street. You used to be my big tough bodyguard. (Roy chuckling) - Okay, you can take the sofa. - I mean with you. - No. - Listen, I know you still love her. Close your eyes and pretend. I just need the company of an old friend. You know, Nicole really is special. There's something about her, something different. I can understand why you love her. (suspenseful ambient music) (creature growling) - No! Roy! Roy! Roy! (creature growling) (intense industrial music) (glass shattering) (intense industrial musiC) (loud thudding) (Roy groaning) (creature groaning) (Bianca screaming) (loud thudding) (intense industrial music) (creature growling) (Bianca screaming) (gates clattering) Roy!

Two snakes? - Tell him to turn it off. (upbeat dance music drowning out lyrics) - I like it so much, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to introduce you to the exit door because you are the death of live entertainment. Ta ta. (laughing) Hello, Roy. You look rough. - We should have words, Hugo. - All right, Roy. Look after the the floor. So what's the news, Roy? - The news? This is the news. What do you know about this? - Hey, hey where did you get that shit? - Last night, something, someone tried to kill me. Now, is there any connection? - Look, Roy, don't point that thing at me. You know I can't stand those things. - You're still dealing, Motherskille. - No, no, no, no, not in that stuff, I'm not! - What's the connection? - Believe me. I swear on my kid's lives that I'm not involved! That's Savary's business, not mine! Roy, I am not involved. That's dirty, filthy, nasty stuff, Roy. That's nasty. My business is legit. - Oh yeah? You're lying, Motherskille. What about Savary? - No, no, I'm not, I'm not lying. Be careful, Roy, be careful! You'll get excited, you'll stab me with it! I manufacture things for Savary, that's all, but not that, Roy, not that! What about the girl, Roy, huh? What about the girl? Try Savary, try to find him and you'll find her. No, Roy, don't. Don't, Roy. You find Savary, you'll find her. Believe me, Roy, believe me. Don't. No, Roy! Don't! Get that thing away! It's Savary, you gotta find him and you'll find her. Roy (mumbles). - [Lawrence] Don't want it. - [Dr. Savary] What don't you want, Lawrence? - [Lawrence] I don't like it. - [Dr. Savary] Lactothiozine? - [Lawrence] I didn't say that. - [Dr. Savary] Oh, so you want it? - [Lawrence] No. - [Dr. Savary] Subject Lawrence Tyack. Age 31. Heroin addict. Referred to me by Waterman on February 19th. - Are you gonna pay me? - [Dr. Savary] Later, Lawrence. First, some questions. - Waterman said you'd pay me for a few tests, he said. - [Dr. Savary] I'll pay you, Lawrence. Trust me. - I want the money first. (tape scrubbing) Easy, easy as anything. Whatever you ask, easy. - [Dr. Savary] And what exactly do you dream about? - Anything. And you can be in it too if you want. You should try it. It's wonderful, it's wonderful. (tape scrubbing) - [Dr. Savary] Lawrence, Lawrence, Lawrence? Tell me how you feel. - Just a dream. The dreams, they're in my eyes. I can feel (mumbles). (tape scrubbing) - [Dr. Savary] Do you want it? - Yes, yeah. - [Dr. Savary] Lactothiozine? Are you sure? - Yeah, I want it. - [Dr. Savary] Now, sit down and tell me how you feel. - The light hurts my eyes. - [Dr. Savary] I'll turn it down. How's that? Is that better? - Yes. - [Dr. Savary] Now come and sit down where I can see you. - [Lawrence] Help me. - Jesus. - Give me some more of White Man. I want to die. - Actually, that was a lie. He didn't. I knew you'd come back sooner or later. I shall shoot you without hesitation, Mr. Bain. Your gun, if you please. (Lawrence muttering on video) Lead the way, Mr. Bain. - Please. Please! - Sit down, Mr. Bain. Lie back. Roll up your left sleeve if you please! - Why are you doing all this? - I have no choice. This drug is euphoric and powerfully hallucinogenic, a superb pain killer, truly superb. People can do amazing feats of strength under its influence. And fortunately, the side effects are unpredictable, and when they're bad, they're terrible. If only it could be made safe. Of course, I stopped manufacturing it as soon as the problems were confirmed, but by then, it was too late. A number of people were already hooked who needed it and I'm the only possible source. I'm doing everything I can to cure them, but it's difficult. Not unnaturally, they don't trust me. - What are you planning to do with that? - With this? I'm going to introduce you to the joys and perils of Lactothiozine, then you too will be dependent upon me. - You addicted Nicole, didn't you? - My addiction to Nicole is more painful, I promise you. - She's one of them, isn't she? - Curiously, she seems to be immune to the side effects. She's just as beautiful as ever. She gives her dreams away, doesn't she? I sometimes wonder how real she could make those dreams if she put her mind to it. She gives me hope that there's some future for this drug. Now, keep still please! (gunshot blasting) (glass shattering) (Dr. Savary muttering) (gun clicking) Please don't! Oh no, please don't! (glass shattering) (loud thudding) (intense synth music) (water dripping) (eerie ambient music) (dynamic synth music) (footsteps pattering) (dynamic synth music) - Why did you bring me here? - Because you take White Man and it doesn't do this to you. - It seems to preserve you, keeps you young. I wanted to find out why. - It's been 12 hours, Nygaard. I need more White Man. - We all do! Savary's cut off our supply. He's punishing us for Red Dog. - I'm sick of your talk. I need a fix. - And how do you suggest we get it? - Direct to Savary. Break his neck. - We need him. - [Nygaard] She's right. - I can get it for you. - How? - I can persuade him. - If we let her go, we lose our bargaining power. - Trust me. - What other choice have we got? - Give me a chance. - Maybe you should speak to Savary. Come with me. (Dudu laughing) - Make him believe you've escaped. Tell him to bring you more White Man. Arrange a meeting at Pepperdine's old place. - Make him come where he can join his children. (phone ringing) - It's me. - Nicole? - I'm safe. - [Dr. Savary] Darling. - I want you. I need you. (eerie ambient music) (water dripping) (moves to faint whimsical ragtime music) (whimsical ragtime music) (record skipping) (gun cocking) (guns cocking) - We've been expecting you. Move him to the wall. Who are you? Hm?! (gun cocking) Who are you? - Don't hurt him. This is Bain. He came looking for me. - He knows where we live. - I'll take care of him. - Go on! Nicole. - Why did you come? - 'Cause I missed you. - Is that all? - No. What are you doing here? - This is my new home. These are my friends. - Savary will be at the house soon. We must go now. - Nicole. Savary, he said you-- - What? - He said you could make dreams. - Real? I thought of that more and more. - [Male Speaker] Nicole! - I have to go. - Nicole. Nicole! Nicole! (Roy groaning) Fluke. - You certainly know some shit, old Bain, I'll give you that. - Yeah, well come and cut me down, will ya? - Motherskille said you'd find her and them. I didn't think you had it in you. - What are you talking about? - Motherskille doesn't care about Nicole. He wanted you to find this place and now we can put the freaks out of their misery. - What? - Savary was getting out of hand. Sooner or later, somebody was bound to get wind of it. - Come on, Fluke! - I'm sure Motherskille would want me to thank you, Roy. - Cut me down, will you!? (Roy groaning) - Can't have Mr. Clean getting too bored, can we? (Roy groaning) - God, you son of a-- - And by the time you come off this stuff, all your little horror show chums will be dead. (Roy groaning) (clattering) Roy, I'll come down and check on you myself. - You-- - In a couple of weeks. See how things have turned out. Sweet dreams. (Fluke laughing) (intense dissonant music) (horn blaring) (suspenseful synth music) (keypad beeping) Mr. Motherskille please. Sir, we've found the creeps. They're meeting Savary at Pepperdine's old place. Yes. Right. Ready and waiting. (banging) (coins clattering) (Roy groaning) (deliberative synth music) - Nicole, darling. (Oriel laughing) (Dr. Savary gasping) Get away! Don't touch me! Here, we have the drug. We've got, look, lots of drug, lots of it. - No one move. Look at us, Savary. A pretty sight. How does it feel, Savary, to beg? - Leave me alone. Leave me alone! If you hurt me, if you hurt me, you'll get no more drugs. I'm the only person who can make it. - No one's gonna hurt you. You're going to join us. - Nicole, stop them. Please help me. - Now, we'll always be together, won't we? - Take him. (Dr. Savary groaning) (intense synth music) (Dr. Savary groaning) (intense synth music) (guns cocking) (gunshots blasting) - [Male Speaker] It's a trick! - You set us up. - It's nothing to do with me. (gunshots blasting) - Get him out of here. (intense synth music) (gunshots blasting) Take cover! (gunshots blasting) (intense synth music) (gunshots blasting) (men groaning) (bullet ricocheting) (gunshots blasting) (man yelling) (gunshots blasting) (gun cocking) (intense synth music) (gunshots blasting) (glass shattering) (gunshots blasting) (intense rock music) (gunshots blasting) (man choking) (intense rock music) (gunshots blasting) (man yelling) (loud crashing) (gunshots blasting) (man yelling) (explosion blasting) (intense rock music) - Roy! Roy! (gunshots blasting) (intense rock music) (loud slapping) (Bianca groaning) - Wait, it's Bain. (intense rock music) - [Hugo] Kill him! (gunshots blasting) (intense rock music) (man groaning) (glass shattering) - [Roy] Come on, we have to get out of here. (explosion blasting) (glass shattering) - Hey, stop it! (gunshots blasting) - They got away! Get the gear! Smoke them out! (intense rock music) (Nygaard groaning) - What do we do now? - You can't stay here. They're gonna kill you. - Who are they? - Savary's employer, Motherskille. He wants you wiped out. - Savary again. Take Nicole, go out the back way through there. - What about you? - We'll lose them in the tunnels. Goodbye. Thanks. - Well, are you coming with me or are you staying here? Come on. - I'm finished. Take them into the tunnels. Run for it (mumbles). - We've got nothing left to lose. (deliberative ambient music) - How far? - Almost there. (gunshots blasting) (people yelling) - I'll have to go back. I should never have left them. Look, stay here, okay? You'll be safe. - Where's Savary? Hey! Where is he?! You're dead if you don't speak. Go on, Darling. Go on, get in there. - Shoo. Get over there! (Darling yelling) (intense industrial music) (gunshots blasting) (Nygaard moaning) - Gas the bastards. (gas hissing) (people coughing) (gunshots blasting) (gun clicking) (people coughing) - There's a moral to this somewhere. Never change sides, Roy. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking how the hell do I get out of this? Simple answer, you don't. I like simple answers. (gun cocking) It's me, you stupid bastard! (gunshots blasting) (man yelling) (intense industrial music) (Hugo coughing) (somber ambient music) - Nicole. Come with me, Nicole. You'll be safe with me. It's all right. Come with me. You'll have everything you want. You're my hope, my vindication. - Bain said you thought I could make dreams real. All right, Savary. I'll make your dreams real. - Oh no. - Show me your dreams. (thunder crashing) (Savary choking) Show me. (thunder crashing) (Savary choking) Show me your dreams. Show me! (thunder crashing) - Let go of me! - Show me! Show me! Show me! Show me. (electricity buzzing) (thunder crashing) Show me. Show me. Show me! Show me, show me, show me, show me! (thunder crashing) (intense synth music) (explosions blasting) (intense synth music) (thunder crashing) (intense synth music) - Nicole? - Are you afraid? You used to love me. - I still do. - Show me. - You can't stay here. - I must. This is my home now. - They're all dead, all of them. It's all over. - No. This is just the beginning. Goodbye, Roy. - Nicole.
