(fast electronic music) (gentle music) - [The Book] The wages of sin is death, is death. Wages, death. Wages, death. Wages, wages. Death, death. The wages of sin is death, is death. Wages, death. Wages, death. Wages, wages. Death, death. - [Pilgrim Voiceover] Oh, Lord. What must I do to be saved? - [The Book] The wages of sin is death, is death. Wages, death. Wages, death. Wages, wages. Death, death. The wages of sin is death, is death. The soul that sins must die, must die. The wages of sin is death. The soul that sins must die, must die. The wages of sin is death. Death, death, death. Death, death, death. Death, death. - [Narrator] The burden of his sins were sore and heavy upon his back. Pilgrim had forsaken the City of Destruction, to set out in search of the Celestial City. He was prepared to face whatever obstacle might come in his way. Even death itself. (crow cawing) Not only did Pilgrim bear the heavy burden upon his back, but the road he must travel held many pitfalls and dangers. Many trials and disappointments. And added to these, indeed the cause of much of these, would be his great enemy, the enemy of his very soul. - Apollyon! - [Narrator] In contrast to the burden upon his back, the traveler carried a book. The very Book of Life. It was the message of this book, which had caused him to leave the City of Destruction. But although the enemy of his soul would continually seek to disrupt his journey, there would also be those to counsel and guide him. - May I help you, Pilgrim? I have been watching you. You seem very troubled. - I am very troubled. This Book tells me of a great judgment coming down from Heaven. I tried to warn my wife and children, my friends and neighbors, but they wouldn't listen to me. - The judgment of which you speak is true. You are wise to heed the warning. Let me introduce myself. My name is Evangelist. - E-van-gel-ist. Then perhaps you can help me. You see, I'm not ready for God's judgment. That's why I left the City of Destruction. - Why do you stand here? - Because I don't know where to go. How, kind sir? How can I escape God's judgment? - Here is a key. It is the key of promise. Do you see that gate in the distance? - No sir, I don't. - Do you see a light? - I think I do. - Good. Go directly toward that light. It will lead you to a gate. When you come to the gate, knock, and you will be told what to do. - [The Book] The people living in darkness. In darkness, in darkness. Have seen a great light. A great light, a great light. In the shadow of death, the shadow of death. A light has dawned. A light has dawned. A light has dawned. (dramatic music) (dog barking) - [Man] Pilgrim! Oh, Pilgrim! - [Narrator] A neighbor in the City of Destruction, Pliable by name, took it upon himself to find Pilgrim and bring him back to his wife and family. In reality, Pilgrim had not left his family. Instead, his wife, influenced by the scoffing of their neighbors, refused to flee with her husband, from the condemned city. - [Man] Pilgrim! Oh Pilgrim! - I say, my dynamic friend. Hold up a moment! - Who me? - May I help you, sir? Oh, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Obstinate. - My name is, uh, Pliable. - Pliable? Pliable? Ah, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Fine family, the Pliables. I know the name. Fine family. - I'm trying to catch up to Pilgrim. - Pilgrim? Pilgrim? I don't believe I ever heard the name. - He just left this morning. He left his wife, and his children, and his friends! - Pity, pity, such a pity. Much too much of that sort of thing these days, isn't there? Oh yes, yes, yes. Much too much! - Can you help me? I've got to bring Pilgrim back to his wife and children. - Bring him back to sanity, you mean to say? But, of course I can help you. I specialize in helping chaps like you. I do, I do, oh yes, yes, yes. (water trickling) Now when we catch up with this weak-minded fellow, you might best leave the talking to me. I've had a lot of experience with his kind. - [The Book] Be sober, be vigilant. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about. - Oh there you are, Pilgrim. I've come all the way-- - I told you to let me do the talking. - Oh yes, Mr. Obstinate, sorry sir. Yes sir, yes sir. - Well, well, what a pleasure! You are Pilgrim, I believe. Pilgrim. Ah, yes. Fine people, the Pilgrims. Yes, yes, yes, I know the family well. Fine people. - But, you said-- (muffled mumbling) - Was there something you're wanting of me? - We want you to go back to the City of, to your wife and children. - I cannot go back. Our city is a city of destruction. It is to be destroyed by the judgment of God. - (laughs) Complete nonsense. People have been saying that for years. Believe me, I know. And judgment has never come. Never, never, never. Nor will it ever come. No, no. - What about Noah? As it was in the days of Noah, so also-- - Noah? Noah? Can't say I've ever heard the name. And I know all the important families, believe me. Now, be sensible, my friend, and come back home. Pilgrim. (chuckles) A fine name. Yes, yes, yes. Don't disgrace it. - Go back? To the City of Destruction? I cannot! Why don't you come with me? We can escape the judgment of God together. - We can escape the judgment of God? - Yes we can. - Nonsense! Preposterous, idiotic, fanatical, impossible, nonsense! - Is it nonsense, Pilgrim? - Not nonsense, Pliable. Eternal Truth. In this Book, it says we must seek for an inheritance that never fades away. - Inheritance? The only way to get an inheritance is to go back to your families. Yes, yes, back to your families. How about it, Pilgrim? Are you coming with us, or not? - I cannot turn back. - All right, then, Pliable. Let's go home without him. (stuttering) - I think I should go with Pilgrim. - Follow this sick-brained fellow? Ah, come back, Pliable, and be wise. - We can escape the judgment of God. - Judgment of God! (crow cawing) [The Book] It is appointed unto men, once to die and after that the judgment. - [Pliable] Do you think the words of your Book are certainly true, Pilgrim? - As the Book itself says, they are written in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began. - What other things does the Book say, Pilgrim? (wondrous music) - We are promised an everlasting salvation. We may earn a crown of righteousness. There shall be no more sorrow or crying. He that is owner of the place will wipe all tears from our eyes. - Will people scoff at us there? - No, Pliable. - Wonderful, wonderful. And who will be at this place? - Thousands, and ten thousands who have gone before us. They are all loving and holy. Everyone walking in the sight of God, acceptable unto Him forever. - I can't wait to get there! (mysterious music) - [Child] Hey, Look! (children laughing) - I don't like being scoffed at, Pilgrim. - Don't worry, Pliable. They are children of darkness. - Pilgrim, I'm hungry and thirsty! (banging) - Pardon me, sir. May we have some water? (laughing) - The journey's not as I expected it would be, Pilgrim. - The book doesn't promise an easy journey. But it does promise a wonderful destination. - [Pliable] Can't we go faster, Pilgrim? I'm eager to reach this place! - [Pilgrim] I can't go any faster, because of this burden on my back. Perhaps we should find a place to sleep for the night. - [Pliable] No, Pilgrim. Let's hurry on. I can't wait to find this place your Book tells about. (dramatic music) (bubbling) - [Narrator] In his foolish eagerness, Pliable put from his mind such lurking dangers as the Slough of Despond, an iniquitous swamp into which many a foot-weary Pilgrim had fallen prey to the wiles of the Evil One. - [Pilgrim] This is a strange way for both of us. We must watch our step in the darkness. (wondrous music) (yells) (splashes) - Is this the wonderful place your Book speaks of? If it's like this at the journey's beginning, what will it be like at the end? - Help me! Help me, my burden is pulling me deeper into the mire! - I'll leave you to possess the beautiful Kingdom your Book talks about. - Help! Help! - My name is Help. I heard you calling. - [Pilgrim] Thank you, oh thank you. I met a man who told me to come this way. His name is Evangelist. - But you should not have gone alone in the darkness. The Slough of Despond is filled with the scum and filth of man's wickedness. Sinners, who are awakened to their lost condition, but have fears and doubts, often fall into this terrible place. - [Pilgrim] And you rescue such people? - If they will permit me to. Where sin abounds. God's grace, much more abounds. - [Pilgrim] Those words are in this Book. - I must leave you now. But just up above you will find a place of shelter for the night. (gentle music) - [Narrator] Pilgrim continued upon his way, as the enemy of his soul increased his efforts against the traveler. (mischievous music) - [The Book] Be sober. Be vigilant. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about. - I say there! You look famished! You seem to be hungry. Come to my little cottage, we'll fix you something to eat. Some food, some food. Yes, yes, yes. How rude of me. My name is Wiseman, Worldly Wiseman. - [Pilgrim] My name is, Pilgrim. - Pilgrim? Pilgrim? Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes. That name sounds familiar. But, of course, of course. Fine people, the Pilgrims. Fine people indeed. You, of course, will have heard of my family. We are high stock, we are, if I do say so. Oh yes, yes. Ask us anything. Anything you like, and you will find the answer. For instance, how did you come by that pack upon your back? - There's a gate I must find. And when I find it, I'll be told how to be rid of this burden. - And who told you about any such gate? - Someone I met along the way. His name is Evangelist. - Evangelist? Huh! Dullards, the whole lot of them! They are, Pilgrim! Dullards, dullards! If you follow the way this Evangelist directs, and all kinds of misery awaits you! Hunger, peril, nakedness, the sword. Didn't he also talk about a cross? Huh! His way? Utter foolishness! - But the burden I carry is so great, Mr. Wiseman. I would gladly face all these things you speak of, if, at the end of my journey, I may be delivered from this burden. - And how did you come by this burden in the first place? - By reading this Book. - I should have known! Should have, should have! You would one day name me your greatest friend, if I tossed this Book into my fire! - [Pilgrim] I will go! - But wait, wait, you haven't eaten! Precocity, bring the food! Wait, wait! I want to help you. I perceive you are a religious man, which is good, good, very good. The world needs more religious people. It does, Pilgrim, it does. Do you see that hill, just yonder? At the top of that hill is the Village of Morality. It's a lovely little place, lovely, lovely. I wish I lived there myself. I do, Pilgrim, I do. Only it doesn't quite suit me. But a dear friend of mine lives there. Mr. Legality. It's the first house at the top of the hill. Mr. Legality will show you how to be rid of that burden of yours! (laughing) (foreboding music) Yes, yes! Yes! - Pilgrim. What are you doing here? Why have you so quickly turned aside from the Way? - I met a gentleman who told me how I might be rid of this burden I carry. - But you have read the words in the Book. Those words are alive and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword. How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? - I have sinned! I have sinned! - Be not faithless, Pilgrim, like those who walk the broad roads to destruction. Remember, the just shall live by faith. Worldly Wiseman, tried to bring eternal condemnation upon you. First, he turned you from the Way. From the One who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Second, he tried to make the Cross an offense to you. The preaching of the cross is to them that perish, as foolishness. But to those who would escape destruction, Pilgrim, the preaching of the Cross is the power of God unto salvation. - Is there any hope for me? Can I still find the gate of which you told me? - Yes, Pilgrim, you may yet find the Way. You may escape the fires of judgment. So may anyone who will heed the message of the Book. (wondrous music) - [The Book] By grace you are saved through faith, through faith. Not of works the gift of God, saved through faith. The gift of God, saved through faith. The gift of God. By the deeds of the law shall no one be justified. Saved through faith, the gift of God. The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, when it cannot rest. The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, when it cannot rest. The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest. The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, when it cannot rest. When it cannot rest. Seek, seek, and you shall find, and you shall find. (knocking on door) Knock, knock, it shall be opened, it shall be opened. Seek, seek, and you shall find, and you shall find. Knock, knock, it shall be opened, it shall be opened. - Good evening, my friend. I am Mr. Goodwill. Who are you? And from where have you come? And to where are you going? - [Pilgrim] My name is Pilgrim. I'm a burdened sinner from the City of Destruction, seeking the Way to eternal life. - You seek the way, do you, Pilgrim? You are very wise. Come, I will show you. How is it you travel alone, Pilgrim? - [Pilgrim] Because no one would listen when I warned of the coming judgment. My friends and neighbors laughed at me, my own family. - [Mr. Goodwill] So it is, too often in this world. - Please, Mr. Goodwill, might you be able to help me take this burden from my back? - The answer is in the Book you carry. And just up the way you will find the house of Mr. Interpreter. Go to him, Pilgrim. He will help you. - I thank you. Thank you. (gentle music) - [The Book] Broad is the way that leads to destruction. Narrow the way that leads to life. Broad is the way to destruction, to destruction. Narrow the way to life, to life. Broad is the way to destruction, to destruction. Narrow the way to life, to life. (knocking on door) - Come in. I have been waiting for you. - [Narrator] Here in the house of Mr. Interpreter, Pilgrim would at last receive the information needed to assure the success of his journey. For like the golden key the traveler carried in his pocket, Mr. Interpreter's words would open Pilgrim's mind to the wisdom and treasures in the Book. Anticipation came like the warming sun to the young man's seeking heart. - What is the meaning of this picture? - The man in the picture says with the apostle, "My dear children, for whom I am in the pains of childbirth, "until Christ be formed in you." Looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith. The Word of God is a lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our path. And the crown above his head? This is to show that, as also may we, he can say with the apostle, Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. After we are set free from our sins, we must fight the good fight. We must finish the course. Then, there will be waiting for us, a Crown of Righteousness. Come let me show you more. You wonder about the burden on your back. - That I do, Mr. Interpreter, I surely do. - This floor is like the heart of man, before he experiences the power of the Gospel, which is the very power of God unto salvation. The dust is the sin in every heart. The broom represents the Law, or you might also say, the effort by good works to justify your sins. But the Book you hold in your hand tells you, by the works of the Law shall no one be justified. Only the power of the Gospel can take away sin. If any man be in Christ, your Book tells you, he is a new creation. The old has gone, the new has come. (mischievous music) - No! No, no, no! (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Yes, Mr. Interpreter had shown the Way. His words, like a lamp in a place of darkness. - [Interpreter] Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the words of this Book shall never pass away. - [Pilgrim Voiceover] Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to Spirit. You must be born again. It is by grace you are saved, through faith, and this is not from yourselves. It is the gift from God, not by works, so that no one can boast. (rumbling) You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich-- - [Man] Yet for your sake, He became poor, so that you, you Pilgrim, through His poverty, might become rich. - [The Book] So that you, through His poverty might become rich. So that you, through His poverty, might become rich. So that you, through His poverty, might become rich. (dramatic music) (gentle music) - [Man] He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities, his suffering brings us peace. By His strife, we are healed. - Father. Forgive them. - Forgive me! - It is finished. - Finished! (dramatic music) By this Gospel, you are saved, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures. That He was buried, that He rose again on the third day, according to the scripture. - [The Book] The words of this Book shall never pass away. - [Man] Your name shall no longer be Pilgrim. Your name shall now be Christian. (dramatic music) - [The Book] There is now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus sets us free from the law of sin and death. - [Narrator] No longer Pilgrim. But now Christian. The traveler continued his sure steps toward the Celestial City. - Hello, my friend and brother. May I journey with you? My name is Faithful. I also walk in The Way. - [Narrator] It was as though Christian and Faithful had been brothers since birth. So unique is this kinship of the spirit, this oneness in a faith, which makes all who so believe members of the same family. Together they shared past experiences, the difficulties they had faced, the blessings they had known. And together they looked with anticipation and confidence toward the continuation of their journey. - [The Book] Be like-minded, having the same love. Be one in spirit and purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain deceit. But in humility, consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others. - [Christian] You also fell into the Slough of Despond, did you, Faithful? - [Faithful] But worse than that, at the foot of the Hill of Difficulty, I met First Adam, who lives in the Town of Deceit. He offered me his three daughters. Beautiful they were, as the world sees beauty. - [Christian] What were their names? - [Faithful] Their names? Lust of the Flesh, Lust of the Eyes, and Pride of Life. - Did you, did you, resist them, Faithful? - By the grace of God, I did. (mysterious music) - How true are the words of the Book. Let us beware the snare of the fowler. (rustling) Did I not quote from the Book, saying, let us beware of the snare of the fowler? - You did. We have no evil intentions. Why were we caught in Satan's net? - Because we are mortals. But listen, I quoted from the Book incorrectly! It reads here of our Lord, surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler. - Deliver us, Christian, from this? - Yes, Faithful, He will deliver us. It is a promise of His Book. And not one of His promises has ever been broken. - [The Book] He delivered me from my strong enemy. This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith. - [Narrator] It was a great deliverance. A time for joy and wonderment. But then, from across the nearby hills, came the sounds of Vanity Fair. (playful music) - Go. You are in the world, but not of the world. (playful music) - [The Book] Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. Vanity of vanities all is vanity. - [Jesus] There is an evil of which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men I said in my heart, enjoy pleasure and to behold, this also is vanity. I made great works. I built houses. I planted vineyards. I gathered silver and gold. - [Narrator] Vanity Fair. So like so much of the world, where people look to shallow laughter and the dust of things. To sham and shadow for their satisfaction. (intense music) - [Puppet] That's easy for you to say. You're just trying to catch me off guard so that I'll tell ya. (playful music) (man laughing) - Hey everybody! Come and see! (laughing) - God bless you! - God bless you? (laughs) God bless you! - God bless you! (everyone laughing) - God bless ya! (everyone laughing) (man laughing) - [Faithful] What shall we do, Christian? - I think it best we keep quiet. (majestic music) - The prince! - [The Book] He walked according to the course of this world. According to the Prince of the Power of the Air. The Spirit that now works with the children of disobedience, To whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants you are. Whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness. - [Narrator] In Vanity Fair, for all its wickedness and wantonness, lived a young man by the name of Hopeful. - How dare they stand in the presence of the prince! - They're not of our kingdom. - [Narrator] In all his young years, Hopeful had never seen anyone defy the Prince. But neither had he seen anyone quite like these two strangers who had so suddenly appeared. - Give me the Book! Does this Book command you not to bow down before me? Does it? - It does, sir! (chuckling) - Shall we burn the Book? - [Crowd] Burn the Book! Burn the Book! - Yes. Burn the Book! - Yes, yes, yes. Or shall we burn them? - Burn them, burn the Book! Burn them! Burn them! (dramatic music) - I condemn you both to be burned! - [Crowd] Burn them! Burn them, burn them! - [Narrator] As the clamor of the throng echoed in the distance, crying out for the burning of the two pilgrims, a strange fire came into Hopeful's heart. Fire and hunger. And the courage to seek out whether there really might be a better way. (crowd shouting) - Stand up, we have work to do! Bring the first man! - [Hopeful Voiceover] Be followers of those who, through faith and patience, inherit the promise. (crowd laughing) I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me, has eternal life and will not be condemned. (crowd chattering) - [Prince] Bring the torch! Let him burn! (dramatic music) (laughing) (poignant music) (gentle music) - [Christian] Your name is, Hopeful. It suits you well. - For many years, my heart was full of an empty hope. But now, through your Book, I have the hope of eternal life! My eyes have never before seen such wonders. Surely the enemy of our souls is far from this place. - [Narrator] Not only was the enemy near, but as the two travelers came upon By-Path Meadow, Hopeful mistook beauty for truth, in their search to follow the right way. - Wait, see how pleasant it is, this way! (foreboding music) Come on, Christian! (thunder rumbling) - I think we've come the wrong way, Hopeful. You see that storm ahead of us? We're still going the wrong way, Hopeful. (thunder cracking) - There's a shepherd's shelter. Look Christian! A castle where we might have found shelter for the night! - Perhaps we can find something to eat. (grunting) - [Man] Come on. (groaning) (yells) - Welcome to Doubting Castle! I am your host, Giant Despair! (gentle music) - [Narrator] How could it be? Two travelers who had been so intent upon their search for the Celestial City. - What will happen to us? Our fate will be like theirs. - [The Book] Let not your heart be troubled, you believe in God believe also in me. You shall know the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth shall set you free. Set you free, set you free. - The key! The key of promise! It will open any door! - [The Book] Set you free, set you free. You shall know the truth, the truth, the truth. The truth shall set you free. Set you free, set you free. (snoring) - [Narrator] By-Path Meadow, a pleasant way. But the wrong way! Only a few steps farther, had Christian and Hopeful continued on the right way, and they would have been spared the grief of Doubting Castle. They could have entered much sooner into that beauteous terrain which marked the beginning of the end of their journey. In this beautiful place of fruit and flowers, milk and honey, Christian and Hopeful came upon the Shepherd's Camp. But more than shepherds, they were, much more. They were guardians and guides. True friends, and true brothers. - Welcome! This is Immanuel's Land. My name is Knowledge. - My name is Watchful. - My name is Experience. - My name is Sincere. - I am Christian, and this is my companion, Hopeful. - Since this is Immanuel's Land, we must be nearing the Celestial City! - Aye, that you are! Quickly, Watchful! Let us show them! (gentle music) - [Christian] Look, Hopeful, look! - Come, Christian! We must be on our way! - It is yet a long journey. And you have traveled a great distance. Stay here and rest awhile. - How can we delay? We must go! - Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil. You see, Hopeful, even our Lord Jesus was tempted by the great evil one. - But, of course, Jesus was in the desert. This is like an endless garden! This is Immanuel's Land. Surely when one has come this far, he's immune to Satan's attack. (reverberating tones) (explosion booms) - [The Book] Take the shield of faith. Take the shield of faith. Take the shield of faith. Take the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God. Take the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God. Take the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God. The word of God. (groaning) Thanks be to God. Thanks be to God! - [Apollyon] Apollyon! (groaning) - [Narrator] The battle is not yours. Christian had read these words many times in the Book. The battle is the Lord's. And if the battle is the Lord's, so also the victory. Thus it was, their journey completed, the time came for Christian and Hopeful, to enter the Celestial City. (gentle music) - [The Book] I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me a crown of righteousness. I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness! Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness! Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall never pass away. (dramatic music) My words shall never pass away. My words shall never pass away. My words shall never pass away. My words shall never pass away. The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. I will fear no evil. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. For Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the House of the Lord forever. (triumphant music) - I lost them. They should have been mine, as so many of these are mine. That one over there? Mine! And those three. And that one there, yes, and that one! - [Narrator] Now it was time to look for others, those yet vulnerable. Those he hoped to win, and winning, take unto himself. - There's a possible victim! Of course, of course You!
