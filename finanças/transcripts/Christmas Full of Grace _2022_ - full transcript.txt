NETFLIX PRESENTS Carlinhos. Oh, for the love of God. Please tell me you have a solution. I have plenty of problems, man. I got reports to review, all these documents to sign, and an inbox full of emails. I mean, I really can't take anymore. You know what I have? It's a work hangover. Talk to me, Leonardo. You all right? These bidding documents need signing. You ready? What are you saying, bro? I just said I was totally swamped here. Yeah, but the shipyard bid's been on your schedule for months now, hasn't it? Look, Leonardo, I don't need more pressure right now, okay? That is my goal. The deal will be pushed back to next year if it doesn't get signed today on the 23rd. Fine! Just give me those. I'll force myself to do it. So pleased you could handle that. By the way, Pedro Afonso's team took a half a day. Would you excuse me, Leonardo? Excuse me, and would you please close my door? I'll just… Yeah, I'll have these over in a bit. Tough day? Well, considering I still have to have dinner with my whole family, it's about to be either terrible or tolerable, Jorge. But today I… Today I've got plans to make a surprise visit to Bebela to propose. You know how it is, right? In three months, we'll have our engagement party. In a year, we'll have our first kid. In three years, bilingual preschool. At 15, he's studying in France, at 18, at business school. After that, an MBA at Harvard. Then he'll work for the company, and in 27 years, he'll take my place working here. I would say that today's normal. Mmm. And you, Jorge? How's your day? Oh. I'm divorced now, Carlinhos. I thought it was for the better, but it's worse. Now I'm juggling two girls, Ritinha and Gabi. Really, Jorge? Already? Well, boss, if I wasn't working on Christmas, I'm not sure how I would decide who to spend it with. You're so lucky that you found the love of your life. I guess. Bebela? Baby? Bebela? Sweetie pie? Sugar muffin? Bebela? Bebela? Bebela? Bebela? Bebela? Oh. What is it, Carlinhos? Uh, you scared me. I thought that you're just… You're taking a bath, huh? Almost done, so… - You know what? I could also use one. - No. No way. I'm almost done. It's really… No, no, wait a minute. Just stay there. I just want to take in this scene right here, as the light, it warms your face, and the ocean in the back… - What are you… - I just captured a photo. Right, one of your little mental pictures. You're weird. - Bebela? - Mm-hmm? It's time we had a conversation. - Sure, let's talk in the living room. - No, really, there's no need. It's just… …ten years together… It's a long time, right? And I think that now it's time for us to move forward to the next level. Forward? I don't… What do you mean by "forward"? Isabela Maria Guinle e Guimarães… …can we live happily ever after? I'm not sure what to say. Say yes. - I'm sorry! - Jesus Christ! I was too out of breath to wait for you to answer him. It's not what you think, all right, Carlinhos? Seriously. - What the hell? - Darling? Carlinhos! Carlinhos. Carlinhos! Ah! Ah! - Somebody… somebody please help me! - Ah! - Ah, forgot my key! - You there! Save me! Ah! Please help me, sir! - You gotta help me! Let me in! - Let me out! Ah! Ma'am, open it! - What? - Open the gate! Huh? Open the gate! Okay, chill out! Hey, Olavo, open up the gate now! Ah! - Ugh! You have to jump out! - Jump the gate? No, bungee jumping. Yeah, obviously, I meant the gate. But how do I… I mean, how? Put your foot here, then here, then here. I'll help you! - Oh for God's sake, dude, come on! - I'm trying! Help me! - Be careful. - Olavo, open that gate now! Open it! Ay! Is it open now? It's opened now! It almost opened up my skull! - Ah! - Ay! - Carlinhos! - Oh! - Sweetie, please hear me out. - Let's get out of here. Carlinhos, come back here! Come here, please, Carlinhos! Just a minute, honey! Come on! Come on! - I got heels on! - She can come with you! CHRISTMAS FULL OF GRACE Well, so much for my extensions. I talked to the guys over there at the kiosk. They're working on finding you a dish towel. Man, I don't need it. Come here. Uh… Uh, except now there's a nipple in my face. So just don't get too cold, or you'll poke my eye out. I better take my shirt off, huh? Make you more comfortable. Oh. Ugh. So, your girlfriend doesn't actually like men? I mean… How long were you two a couple? Ten years. Ugh. Ah, thanks. Uh, we'll take turns if you want, okay? I'll put it on my head, then you can put it on yours since she made you wear the horns. We'll do that. You're not from Rio, are you? No. From Paraíba. My whole, uh, family lives out on a farm in the country. Here to spend Christmas in the marvelous city? No. Every year, I spend Christmas in Aspen with my family, okay? Except, this year, it went all wrong, and I'm screwed now. My God, this is… Calm down. Talk to me. How did you end up over here? I should be where it's snowing, in the most beautiful wonderland. But the airline's full of idiots. I had to stop here, you know? So I said, "Ah, Rio de Janeiro, I'll take a second for myself." "I'll work on my tan or whatever." But then I was assaulted! Everything was stolen from me! ID, passport, cell phone, all my cash, my suitcase. Even my friggin' dignity. And I can't even tell my family that I'm stuck here. Calm down. Do you want to use my cell phone? Come on, really? You think I know their numbers by heart, dude? Everything was on that cell phone. Don't you understand? Secrets and contacts and nudes, the works! Can't you see I'm screwed? Wait, wait. And now my hair's all frizzy 'cause the ocean. Hey, Jorge? I'm gonna need your help with something. I'm just here with… - Um, what's your name again? - Graça. I'm here with Graça, who was mugged. I'll send you my location and explain afterwards. Uh, Jorge, uh, please bring me a shirt. Thanks. Relax, okay? I'll take you to the police station, and they'll help you. Okay, dude, what are the police gonna be able to do? They'll just complicate things. If they go after the thief, then the thief comes after us, and then it's basically over. No, if the universe took it, well, then it wasn't supposed to be mine. No, no. My buddy Jorge… Jorge has a contact. Come on. Do you understand the situation? Jorge, I already said we're off duty till the 26th, okay? No, Sara. Come on. - Hey, please, do me a solid. - No. - Not even for your Mustache Man? - I can't, no. Not even for you. But wait, what do you mean you're not working? Well, the 23rd of December is Christmas. They don't even want to work on Christmas Eve-Eve? Oh man. Watch, next year, they'll be closed for the holidays by December 1st. Listen, ma'am. It's our holiday schedule, reduced staff. Only emergencies, okay? Do you really need more emergencies than the one we've had? Huh? I lost Christmas. And then I had my head all banged up. He's wearing the horns because of his cheating ex, and, well, this guy… Mmm… He's really been there for us. What's with the justice system in this country? What's that? Lady, if you don't calm down, I'll have you arrested for disrespecting an officer, okay? - Sound good? - No, no. Everyone in jail for the holiday, huh? How about that? Hey, chill! Sara! Sara! What's up, Jorge? Where'd you find this hot contact? On Tinder? Keep it down, will you, Carlinhos? Ah, look! There! The "emergency!" The emergency is finding out who their secret Santa was. And you two were like, "I can help you. Let us help you." Ugh, how humiliating. Thanks for nothing. Graça! Hey, relax, Graça. Chill. How can I relax? Don't you see that my Christmas is ruined, dude? No, no, it's not. We'll figure something out to get your stuff back. What's to figure out? Huh? You heard that awful lady back there. I have to spend Christmas in this… this filthy, freezing cold police station! Yes, what is it, Jorge? Your engagement with Lady Sofia. Dude, Lady Sofia? Seriously? You're talking about your dog? Bring her to the vet, huh? No, she's my grandmother. But she can behave like a rabid dog. Well, Lady Sofia's nickname is as British as her punctuality. Jorge, you're worried about getting there late? I think I might just skip it this year. - No way! - No way! Are you crazy, man? For no reason, you're gonna skip the holidays? Really? Stupid, useless present. Hey, wait, that's not hard to fix. Just melt the ring down for something else. Hmm. How do I explain this to my family on Christmas Eve? Well, it's not really that terrible, is it? Seriously? Not terrible, Jorge? How will they react when they see this Christmas I'm wearing reindeer horns? You think they're gonna be impressed? No, no, look, relax, okay? I just realized how I'm gonna get you through this. But, of course, I'll help myself out too. Me helping you ends up helping us both, so we're essentially helping each other out, you know? No, I don't. Check it. You show up with a brand-new girlfriend. And then you don't have to explain anything. It's obvious. A new girlfriend? Fake girlfriend, okay? You get it, right? And then I won't have to stay at this bunk-ass police station this holiday, and you won't have to show up to your family as a cuck, as a poor fellow with horns, "El Dumpo," a huge loser, a… a coward... Okay, I get it, I get it. That's a courageous idea. Would you do that for me? Uh, well, no, I don't think it's for you really. Look, it's nothing against you. I mean, I'd tap that any Sunday. If I wasn't already busy. Mostly it's because it's Christmas. Because it's a time for family, and… Well, if I can't be with mine, I might as well borrow yours! Smooth. Hey, okay, look, it's better not to. I really couldn't. I couldn't go through the entire holiday lying to my family. I get you. No prob. Well, don't lie about it then. You just tell the truth, okay? Just tell them what you saw in that bathtub. But tell them everything, huh? Yes, tell it all while you're carving the Christmas turkey. To the whole fam, dude. Tell me you love me! I love you, Bebela! You never forget your first time flying, right? First time flying? Sweetheart, it's not my first flight. I'm totally used to flying, all right? Doesn't seem like it. I said I was used to it, not into it! Anything that flies has to have wings. Airplanes and pigeons and mosquitos even! But the wings on this? This is a fan strapped to a tin can, man! How can I trust that? No, thanks. Ah! I don't wanna die! Oh my God! - It's a Christmas land. - Shall we? Holy Jesus! Hey, what is this place? Oh, no way, man! You guys have a real sleigh! Ah! Wow! It's a snowman! Oh, it's just made of cotton, but at least it's cold! No, no, no! Be careful! Oh, your Christmas tree is huge! You've got gifts for everyone here! No! Don't do that! Stop! - Graça! - This is amazing! There's more! Oh my God! - Hey, Graça, wait! - No way, I can't even! A chimney for Papa Noel? Oh! And the clock from Harry Potter? How did you get all this stuff? Oh no, guys, are you serious? Clearly, no one thought about Papa Noel's logistical situation. Why do people always go for fashion over function with things like these? Papa Noel's never gonna squeeze himself in there with all his presents. Come on, now. For the love of God. You guys, look at this thing. This is not gonna work for Papa Noel. Uh, I guess I didn't really think this through, huh? I'm sure it'll be fine, boss. You simply brought home a random stranger for Christmas dinner with your entire family. What could go wrong? He'll have to throw the gifts down here and ring the bell to get in. How rude! Please don't leave. Please help me! - What's going on? What's all the noise? - You scared me! Lady Sofia? No! Lady Sofia is her. - Whoa, wait, is she dead? - Shh! I'm the one responsible for ensuring she gets what she wants, which is order! Dona Chica assists my grandma personally. Francisca. I've told you a thousand times. I'm Graça! Hi there! Graça? Who's that? Graça who? Graça from where? - Eh, Paraíba! - Graça is my girlfriend, Dona Chica. Francis… You have a new girlfriend? We're a couple now. I gotta say, I noticed your last relationship was a bit bland, kiddo. Oh, hey, look! You have to go overseas to find a nutcracker! You can't get those in Brazil. Nuh-uh! Hey, Missy, where you off to? Bring yourself back over here. Don't you go running through this hall! You'll have this room to the left. It was Bebela's. It's already prepared. - You had a separate room for Bebela? - Mmm. You didn't sleep together here? That explains a whole lot, doesn't it? And her bags. Where are her bags, hmm? Uh, so, about that, Dona Chica, I'm gonna need your assistance. Hmm. - Hi, Carlinhos. - Solange. Hey, what's up? - Yo, watch out, little man! - Oh! Hey, dude, let me go! Uh, Pedro Afonso, do you have to act like a toddler every time you're with your cousin? Come on, Sol. I'm just educating him by playing the role of a mature cousin. That's all. And I'm the adult who's tired of you acting like an asshole! What's that? Really, Carlinhos? You think I'd beat up my own cousin, man? Of course not. Could I? Nah. But, hey, I might! I take it back. No, no, I didn't mean what I said. Really, you guys don't act like toddlers at all. Anyway, Carlinhos… I haven't seen my sauna sister. Uh, Bebela? Uh… Yeah. Uh, so, about that… I actually met someone. Whoa! Hey, you know something? Thank God that banister's shined up twice a day. Seriously! Because if I got caught on a splinter coming down, man, I bet it would've just torn up my ass! Graça, this is my cousin, Pedro Afonso, and his, uh… his girlfriend, Solange. Mmm, delighted. It's my pleasure. So happy to make your acquaintance. Uh… Hey, I've got vertigo. Just chill, huh? So, you're seeing each other now? Marvelous. And what are you wearing? We goin' on a Christmas safari? Mmm, it's really not my style either, but it's all Dona Chica had for me. Oh no, wait up, baby. Don't even say that this little scatterbrain asked you to come at the last minute and you still agreed to show? Clearly! Do you really even need to ask, Solange? Yes, I did, but the lack of clothes is a completely different story, so… Sex on demand. It's too much for my clothes to bear. What? I don't, um… - You don't get it, honey? - No. Sex, dude! Bangin' the thang! The spanky hanky-panky, girl! This guy here won't even give me a minute of peace! He wants it day and night! Yeah, look, I'm in a lot of pain. My alignment's all off, and I'm limping because, man, I tell ya, yesterday… I have to say, that rump was a spectacular performance. - Excuse me. - I wish I saw their faces. Opa! It keeps getting better! Ah, it's so sour! - You wanna try it? - Uh, no. Look, Graça, I don't think this is gonna work out. Because my family's very intimidating. - And honestly, my grandma is uptight... - Carlinhos! There you are! - Please, we have so much to talk about. - Auntie, let me introduce you to Graça. - Oh, it's hideous. - Huh? That's such a hideous, stupid idea. One minute, almost out of this meeting. No, uh, Carlinhos is a little slow, but he's not irresponsible. He just signed it. - I did? - Yes, he did. Sign the shit, all right? Luís Otávio, I don't care. Put her out to pasture! But, Auntie, Filomena's pregnant. God sakes, Luís Otávio. Filomena's knocked up. Don't fire her. Ah, she's at-will, though! Yep, she's done. Look, I've settled things here with Carlinhos. And what's this? Why have I not received that contract? Miss, I don't have it. Take the needle out of your dang arm and send it, Luís Otávio! For the love of God, can't you work with one hand? Well, being in the hospital is no excuse, Luís Otávio! I want it on my desk in five minutes. Man, is your family serious? Is this Christmas or Halloween? Y'all are really scary, dude! Let's meet someone who's not working for the company. Because they can't. I mean, no one does anything. - Alice? - You've gotta… Wait a sec. We'll talk about it later. I just love that you felt confident and secure enough in your life to leave your girlfriend of ten years so you could bring a complete stranger here to our family estate without giving any kind of notice to anyone. - Your aunt's a little nosy, huh? - Hmm. Alice is my mom. What do you mean, dude? Then why are you calling her Alice? What should he be calling me, "sweetie"? Mother? Mama? Ma or Mamacita? Carlos Henrique is a grown adult. He's on his own. And there's no need to infantilize our relationship, you get it? Uh, well, I can see. I don't really get it, though. Your upbringing was different, I guess. - So… - Mmm. How did your paths happen to cross, then? - The beach. - Festival. - At the fest... - At the beach. Ah, was it a festival, or was it the beach? Uh, a festival on the beach. A luau, they call 'em. As soon as I laid eyes on Graça, it was like, um, a coup de foudre. Uh, no, no. Wait a sec. No shady sex stuff. Uh, he's just being a little cheeky. - I don't really do all that. - No, no, no, coup de foudre. It's French. It's… it's, um, like a bolt of lightning. Yes! Well, it sure is a bolt of something, isn't it? Hello. You must be this Graça that everyone's talking about, huh? Hello, Pop. Carlinhos, Son, I'm going to need a word. - Well, actually, Pop, I... - Let's go. No! Wait, wait! - Right now. - Graça, stay here. Don't! Wait! No, no. Don't… I'll wait here. I want to know what's going on. Where's Bebela? Look, we split up, okay? Yes, Son, it's obvious that you split up, but I want to know who ended things. And, well, why? - That's my business. - No, Carlinhos, it's not. Especially when you bring home a random new girlfriend to meet your family all at once. We should've discussed it, Son. This is not right. What were you thinking? I'm not sure. And another thing, Son, I really hope you're aware that you're basically handing this company to Pedro Afonso on a silver platter? No, I'm not! Come on! There's still a whole lot that has to be considered about all that. And Graça's awesome, Pop. You guys will see. Mmm. Mmm! Carlinhos, who the hell is this Graça? - Pop! - Yo! What's good, kid? Could you help a girl out? Would you go and grab me some kind of little snack? 'Cause I'm so starved I could eat a horse. You're a kid, you know the house. It'll be way faster, girlfriend. Oh, and I'll play cops and robbers with you later. Securing the public is no laughing matter. As militias continue to grow, terms like "robber" and "cop" have become utterly meaningless now. Man, kiddo, how old are you again? A sufficient age. Okay, um… Excuse me, please. I, uh… I'm trying to read, all right? Well, well, well! Are you the famous Graça? I've heard all about you! Well, it's a pleasure. I'm Milu. Stick with me if you want to have any fun. Ay! Finally, a real human being in this house. Mother of God! Thank you, Jesus! - You want something to eat? - Yes! Please, girl! My God, I've been trying to find something to eat. Come on, let's get you to the kitchen. - Yeah, kitchen's right here, so... - Oh jeez! Don't look yet. Just hold on! Dow! Dow! You dig? Bento Leão is here! Well, yeah, of course he is, honey! Mi amor, come here! - What's happenin', sweetheart? - You all right? Mwah! You're Bento Leão! I'm your biggest fan! I even memorized your videos on TikTok. First of all, nice dance skills. Second, I'm just humbled that you're my fan. That's so lit! Seriously, it's so dope to have your support. Honestly, though, tonight I'm just here as a guest. Come on! Just sing for us later! We'll dance! - Babe, real talk? - Uh? Uh. - Ah! - Well, she's right, you know? - I'll see you later. I got you. - Will you? Look who's here! Tales, wait! Come here, Tales. Come talk to us. Hi, honey. - Uh, so kinky! - What? Poly life, huh? So how does it work? Does somebody have priority? Uh… Stop it! Oh, are you nuts, girl? Tales here is my son. Ah! Ah! It's nice to meet you, Tales. He doesn't want to talk to me, I guess. Oh no, he doesn't talk. Tales is a monk now. He's sworn vows of silence and chastity and dullness. Ugh! Ah, then, uh, namaste. - Attention, now! - What? It's eight o'clock. Now come on! She's here. Come on! Let's go! - But where are we going? Who's here? - Come on! Graça, where were you? I looked everywhere! You all right? Since when does my martini come with two olives in it, Dona Chica? Excuse me, Lady Sofia. We'll fix it right away. No, it's fine. But I hope this is our last error for tonight, understood? Attention, family! Please! Attention, attention. Since our entire family is here with us this evening, I would like to propose a toast. To our great leader, who... Hey! After my last bypass surgery, Doctor Mizael presented me with two options. Leave the board at the company, or I can replace my heart with a new one. And being that I'm simply not able to go purchase a new heart for myself… Uh, no, you really can't buy one, Mom. I checked with our lawyers, and it's apparently such a serious crime that they'll even put away people like us. I know that, Íris. I was playing. Of course she was playing! Do you think our mother was really gonna go buy a heart? - Milu, please just shut up, okay? - Yeah, guys, Mom found a heart for sale! So, the thing is, in a manner that's quite abrupt and also a bit premature, I'm being forced to pass the baton of our company, Bragança-Salles. - How come, though, Mom? - Did you hear that? I came to the right holiday! - The drama in your family... - Shh! Silence now! As I was saying, throughout the Christmas weekend here, I'll be deciding through various assessments, who's most apt to take my post. Naturally, it'll be someone in the family. And the person will work side by side with our current CEO. Uh, actually, that's… Well, that's above the CEO, which is me, right? In practice, he's correct. Hey! Psst! Psst! Psst! Hey, kid! Come here! Hey, explain all this business. You're smart and you get it. So what's all this CEO business? Who is it? The one in charge? Chief Executive Officer. That's what they call the executive who's in charge. And what she'll decide is who will be the Chair of the Board of Directors. Sweetie, I asked if you could explain it, not if you could make it more confusing! Milu, I just want to understand what's going on with the fam. Listen, don't stress out about this whole CEO thing. They're deciding who will be the boss. Place your bets, girl. We've got quite the lineup fighting for the Iron Lady's throne! The workaholic sweetheart, your boyfriend. - The underhanded ruthless overachiever. - Ah. The Snow Queen. The rebel without a cause, my darling son, who has no cause. The misunderstood artist, suffering always. The child prodigy, who's dreadfully boring as prodigies go. And then there's me, a complete mess, fun as ever. Caught up yet? Wait, be quiet. Who's unfamiliar laugh did I just hear? Carlinhos, out of the way. Grandma! What's the deal? Well, Bebela looks different, huh? Could you please come closer for me, my dear? Gonna go say hi. - And again, that was who? - Tsk. - Lady Sofia. - And what's your name? Uh, Graça. Like "Grace," you know? Dinner is served, my lady. Our dinner is served. You know, I'm thinking it might not have been so bad at the police station. But I think she likes me, huh? I don't know, everyone's got their own taste. Your favorite. Uh-huh. For eyelashes, right? You don't like escargot? - Oh, no, it's good! - Ah. I like it so much, I eat it with, uh, my hands! I'm gonna suck mine down too! It's more intimate like that, isn't it? Oh yeah, sweetie, get it! Uh, it really was a matter of bad timing, Grandma. We just missed the bidding deadline by half an hour. Yeah, well, you know the deal, Carlinhos. Almost doesn't count when it comes to business. It was only half an hour, but you still missed it. I'm personally one of those guys who'd rather win when they play a game. The shipyard, was that it? That's right. Yes, Grandma. Don't worry about it, Carlos Henrique. That bid was rigged anyway. It's all right. And I will not soil my reputation! I'm not gonna soil mine either, Grandma. What else have you got? Huh. Yeah. Since we're all here, tell everyone about your breakup with Bebela, huh? That was really abrupt, wasn't it? You don't have to worry about me. I'm fine, thank you. Hey, but the company should worry, right? As a construction company, it's important to worry because Bebela, who has been our Princess of Cement until now, could be a little hurt after being swapped out like a bad gift. In fact, we've all been wondering exactly what happened with this, um, rush and abrupt breakup you had with Bebela. For nothing. Hey, now! It wasn't all for nothing because he ended up with me! And another thing, to understand the motives that Carlinhos has, you have to have a heart beating in your chest. She was talking figuratively. She wasn't talking about your heart condition. Yes, I'm aware of the metaphor, Carlos Henrique. Now answer your cousin. Bebela and I mutually chose to separate. That's it. How mature. Excuse me, but, uh, maturity, right? Come on. Let's hear it. Maturity, Carlinhos! My man right there! Hey, Bento, read the room. Mmm. I've got an idea. Since we're all mature adults here, shall we invite Bebela? Let's call her and see if she can come to lunch tomorrow! After all, she spent ten years in our family, and I mean, she just disappeared out of nowhere like the Dungeon Master. Bebela? Where are you? In here? Look, man, cut it out. It's not necessary at all. And dialing. Whoa, look at that. Called her by accident. - Technology, right? - Aw, tell her that I miss her. - Yeah, sure, we can... - Here we go. Graça, have you totally lost it? Oh, no. I've got all my wits about me. My head's right, and my vision is real strong. It's different from you guys, who'd rather pretend I'm not even here. Just put it in some rice. It'll work fine, okay? Ugh. I'm so here for this drama! Oh! Feel that family energy in the air? It'll bring us closer. Marvelous! And… and… and also, you guys keep on triggering me, you know? And, I mean, I'm not even rocking my own look. And you guys keep talking about how Bebela is so great and so pretty. Is it attention you need, girlie? Well, I'll give you some attention. So, family, why don't we find out all about this here mysterious, hysterical stranger Carlinhos brought to us for the holidays? Maybe about her habitat or her diet. Maybe her reproductive tendencies. Shut your mouth, Pedro Afonso! It's Christmas! That's true. A holiday with family. And I want to know about hers. So who are you working for, huh, girl? I'll give you some deets on my family, if you can show me you know yours, man. Of course I know my family. Are you insane? We'll see about that. Start by telling us your girlfriend's number one favorite food. So basic. Yeah, Solange? - Mm-hmm. - Tartare. Steak tartare. Huh? Steak, Pedro Afonso? I don't even eat meat! - I can't even believe it. This is absurd! - Wait, honey, it was an honest mistake! - Tofu tartare! - You are something else. Tofu? Ugh! Pedro Afonso, you boy, you are a "fu." - Sittin' here makin' a fool of me! - Tartare of all styles. She loves it all. She's just nuts for tartare. Oh, come on! What? Tartare! Solange! Hey, everyone, you all want to keep playing? I mean, since all of us are here. You wanna try? What was the first word Carlinhos ever said? Uh, uh, well, it was, uh, uh… Enéas, you tell her. Uh… He… he… Well, what he said was, uh… What did Isolda ask for this year from Papa Noel? Oh, my daughter no longer believes in Papa Noel. - I believe. - Shut your mouth. Can you tell me your father's full name? - I believe in him! - Eat your food. Who's the most favorite popular daughter of Lady Sofia? And when was the first time Alice said "I love you" to Enéas? Look, I mean, we don't know. It's… - Was it before we got married? - Enéas! Ah! Ugh! Wait, did you… did you just pelt me with bread? Graça, you just broke my family! Ah, Carlinhos. It ain't broken. Families get in fights sometimes. But then they make up, and love each other more. My family's not like that. Well, it could be, ya know? Look, I just did them a solid. Everyone was so… Well, so stuffy. It was like we were being cooked with pressure. And now all that steam was let out, you know? Hey, blow off some steam with them, man. Do it! You're very restrained and uptight. Go let it out. Come on, Carlinhos! Go on, hon, and free all that steam up! Guys, what's going on here? Hey! What are you doing? Why are you… Auntie, no, wait, wait, wait, wait! - Graça! - Oh God! You almost scared me to death, Dona Chica! It's Francisca! Ugh! Why are you here this time of night? Why am I here? I want to know how a country bumpkin as simple as you was able to crash this holiday party! Hey! Simple? Sheesh. Show me some respect, all right? Ah, listen, okay? I'm rich, yo. Trust fund kid and everything. Will you get back here? All right, little girl. You turn around right here, right now, and tell me the truth for real. Or I have to resort to violence. Ah! This wasn't already violence, then? You think I'll be able to sleep with the image of you sitting there waiting like Chucky for me? Ah! Well, it's about to get much worse. I'd do just about anything if it protects my kiddo. Dona Francisca, sit down, please. Mmm. Don't order me around. I'll sit down just because I'm tired. Look, I want you to understand, Dona Francisca, I know that you just want to protect Carlinhos, and that he's like a son to you, but I don't want a thing. I don't want his money or anything from him. Okay, so what are you doing here? I'm here for a Christmas that's joyful. You can have a joyful merry Christmas with your own family, girlie. - Not with strangers you just met now. - I know. But my father's Papa Noel. Huh? Huh, what? My father is Papa Noel. Everyone thinks that Papa Noel lives a life that's completely magical. But it's actually a really tough job. Hey there, elf! Can you have them wait? I got pee all over my lap again. Ugh! Poor man had to take care of all those kids. And guess who was the last one in line? Sweetheart. Hi, honey! Hey, Papa. Listen, I've just got a little more time here. All right. But I did bring you a little present, my baby girl! This right here… …is Saint Nicholas. The first Papa Noel. He would go from house to house blessing all of the families. Well, thanks, Papa. - Ah, you're welcome. I love you, hon. - Love you. Now Papa has to go back to work, okay? All right. Mwah! And then, after I lost my father, it really didn't feel right to spend Christmas all alone. And that's why I crash other people's holidays. You get it? Mmm, I see. But I still don't know how my sweet kiddo has anything to do with it. Oh, I'll explain. You're really gonna think I'm nuts. Ha! I already do. Okay, so, every single year, I go all out, and get dressed up and go to a tourist town to find a new family, and feel the holidays, you know? And this year, when I was screaming in terror, Carlinhos responded immediately, right? And this is where I felt I should stay. - Do you want to see other years? - Yes. - Okay, here. - Mm-hmm. This… This here is a family from Portugal. Oh! They were so magical, for real! I had met them over at CADEG, and I explained that I didn't have the money to see my family in Paraíba, and that my name was Maria da Graça. Look at her. Wait, wait, wait. Who's this with the mustache? He's cute. That's Dona Lurdes. Ah. Oh, and this Christmas, we got fit. Man, they didn't even do a turkey. Do you believe that? Only boiled chicken! And no farofa! Only water. Crazy. Wait. Oh, look at your face. It looks a bit like you're on the toilet. Oh yeah. This family was German. And, well, there was this annoying guy there, Rui. He seriously thought he was my boyfriend. Ah, so then you don't date someone from the family every year, huh? No. No, of course not. We're just pretending so no one finds out that Bebela was a filthy little hoe. That horrible woman really cheated? Oh, honey, she won't find another man like Carlinhos in a million years. Mm-mm! Why the face? What if she didn't cheat on him with a man? How sad? Oh, my poor kiddo. Vanquished by a hoo-hoo. Mm-hmm. Yeah, Dona Francisca. At the end of the day, I'm helping Carlinhos out with a serious problem. Well, yes, but you're creating one for me. Honestly, it's crazy. And to think now I have to keep up with this lie. On Christmas, no less, Graça. I can't. There's no way. Oh, Dona Francisca, please help me. I promise it's just for Christmas dinner. Well, and lunch tomorrow too, right? All right. Oh, come on. I have to grab a little something before I go. But look, I promise you that after we eat lunch on Christmas day, I'm on the road, and you will never again hear the name "Graça." But can I just stay and enjoy this holiday now? May I stay here? Hmm. - Morning. - Morning. - You want to eat something, kiddo? - No, but thanks, Dona Chica. I'm okay. Painting this early, huh? Uh-huh. My present for Lady Sofia. A reference to the "Last Supper," or…? No, no, it's "Saturn Devouring His Son." Very fitting, Alice. "Mama." What? Didn't your girlfriend interrogate me last night about what the first word you ever said was? It was "Mama." Oh! Oh! Oh, hey, Grandma! What's going on? You ladies are talking? Please, Carlinhos, as if I really have to answer to my own grandson. Girl! I love it when Lady Sofia doesn't hold back her feelings. It's refreshing. Uh-huh. All right, then. Come on, Graça. Hey! I'm not done. Well, he's got a point. We really should go prepare for our match now. Oh, and I am curious to experience the lovely Graça's skills because, of course, you're playing? - No! - Yes, I am! Okay? Why not? I will! Of course. Yes, I'll play all over. Yeah, I'm a player. Play on, player. All right, then. Uh, we're just, uh, gonna go get ready. All right, then. Thank you, Dona Sofia. Lady Sofia. Yeah, Lady's the name, right. Lady. She's Lady Sofia. - You can handle polo? - Polo? She didn't mean a game of cards? No! There's no way I'm getting myself into a bikini in front of everyone, okay? No, no, not water polo. Just polo. Oh, then, normal polo is, uh… I can totally play that. Polo is just, uh… You know, it's polo. It's, uh… Yeah, I got it. Just leave it to your girl. It's yolo polo. I'm a polo champion. Polo it is. Son, you forgot your helmet. Pay attention, all right? You're about to witness… Agrogirl! I'm also known as the, uh… the Farm Chick, get it? You know, I've been playing this game since I was a tiny girl on the farm. One, two, three. Oh! I'm okay, guys. I'm cool. Really, I'm all right. I don't need help. Plus, that one was just for practice. To think we would've had Bebela. She won silver at the Olympics! Team Pegasus, advance! Pedro Afonso, when did you become captain? Who knows, Ma? Come on! Let's ride, y'all! Come on, Bento, concentrate! And halt! So? You ready to begin? Of course, man. Team Pegasus is ready to go. Aren't you guys missing something? At ease, guys! Everything okay? Oh yeah. Totally awesome. - Well, come on, then. - Sure. I was just waiting for you guys. Here, Esmeralda. Let me help. - Ah. - Come on. It's just that the mares in Paraíba are a little calmer, you know? Well, you'll have to show this girl who's boss. Oh, that's God. Yeah, that too, in a manner of speaking. - Hey, Francisca! - I'm so sorry, Dona Alice. There we go. That's all right, huh? Oh, Lord. Ugh, I know. Tell me about it. It's shameful to watch this game without the best rider on the team. - Bebela should be playing out there. - Let it go. Forget about boring Bebela. This one's way more exciting. - Graça! Graça! Graça! - Graça! Graça! Graça! Quiet down! The match is about to commence, so I demand no distractions. Hmm! Eh, she loves killing my buzz. Ugh. - Come on, honey! - Let's go! Whoo! Whoo! Without Bebela, this one's completely lost and playing like a chicken! Bite me. It's gonna be a landslide! Go fetch the ball, ball girl! Isn't that a football thing? Hey, you ready? Ready, bro. Yeah-hoo! Whoo! Go, Esmeralda! - Come on, Graça! Come on! - Jesus! Yes! - Go! - Yeah, that's right! I warned y'all! Eh… Eh… Uh… Lady Sofia! Oh no! I murdered your grandma? Oh my God! Two thousand years of polo, and this is the first time I've heard of an accident happening with a spectator. - Are you done, doctor? - Yes. It really looks super. Shh! How embarrassing. Ugh! I wish I could just disappear right now. Graça, come with me. No. I didn't mean like literally disappear. Come on, Graça. My God. But I can't stay in this big house without him. Carlinhos! REAL CHRISTMAS PETRÓPOLIS You scared me. I thought you were gonna freeze me out, but look at you giving me the warm and fuzzies instead. I used to come here a lot as a kid. - I thought you'd enjoy it. - You kidding? I love it here, Carlinhos! This is Christmas! The kids running around, and people lining up. They're eating turkey legs, and the blinky-twinkly lights are all lit. - Merry Royal Christmas. - Oh, wait. Ah, come on now. You made me look like a doofus. All right, let's get a better one, okay? You can pick up your photo in two hours at booth one. Graça, what's got you all happy? Why is Christmas so special to you? Because Christmas is everything, Carlinhos. Christmas is just Christmas, you know? It's… It's Christmas! Well, I know you're not so great with words. For me, Christmas is just so commercial. That's all. So… Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay! We need to get our little Carlinhos all excited with the spirit of the holidays! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! - No, no, please! Graça, don't! - Take this mask now. Mouse king, come on. And I get to be the Nutcracker. Wasn't the Nutcracker a man, though? Gender's just a construct, Mouse. Okay then, Nutcracker. So, Mouse king, what do you want for Christmas this year? Mmm, I mean, I'm gonna be like those foolish kids and ask Papa Noel to make my Christmas wish come true. I wish for the company, but it would take a Christmas miracle for that to happen. And Papa Noel isn't even real. Ho, ho, ho! Too far with that one? Sorry, I'm being obnoxious, right? Look, uh, this accident won't affect who she picks to get the company, okay? And Papa Noel isn't the reason. Humans ruin everything. The spirit of the character, he's awesome. No, Carlinhos. Relax, it's not your fault. I think I'm just hungry or something. Really, I just need a great meal. Yeah. How about this. Buy us these masks here, because, you know, my wallet got stolen, then go buy some cotton candy, and I'll get us some croquettes so we can stuff our faces. - Sounds great. - Ho, ho, ho, ho! Hey, mister. May I have two Christmas croquettes? Sure. You want the farofa? Graça? It's me, Rui, from Christmas last year. You have me confused with someone else. There's no Graça here. Always joking. Wow! Hey, Mom, look! Graça? Wait, Graça! Graça! - Come on, come on, come on! - Hey, wait, Graça! I didn't even... - Hey! - Graça! Hey, Graça! Hey, Graça! - I'll explain later. - Graça! Hey, Graça! Graça! Graça! Graça! Hey, Graça! Graça, stop! Wait! - He's gone, all right? - Uh, he? Look, Graça, I might look dumb, but I'm not, okay? Who's the guy in the lederhosen? He's a really annoying guy from my past. And, uh… You know, I'll tell you something. Some guys should have leaflets to warn you about the damage that they'll cause. Yeah. Well, it seems like all of us have to go through some heartache until we meet the right one. So that cotton candy… Should we have it? Here. It's yours. No way. We're sharing it, dude. No, I don't like it. Really. Eat it. - Just a bite. Come on. - Wait! Okay, I'll have some. Mmm! Man, that's good. Told you. The museum's about to close. How about a tour? You have this habit of using fancy words out of nowhere, don't ya? A tour, man? It's a visit. Just a walk. You cruise around, you know? Yeah, all right, fine. You want to cruise then? Mmm. Right after I demolish this. Hi there. How are you? Here you go. Good evening, guys. Welcome to the Petrópolis Museum. No, Graça, you can't sit there. Come here. It's a chair. How come I can't sit? - No, it's part of the exhibit. - My God! Look at it! Look at this! Wow! Hey, I'm positive that your grandma has one exactly like it in her office. For real. Just like hers, huh? It's a replica throne styled like Don Pedro II's. Who, incidentally, was very subdued and timid. Hmm. I know someone like that. Me? No. No way. Come on. He inherited Brazil at 14. - He was 14 years old? - Yeah. At 14, I was still playing with toys. I don't even know what I'd do with Brazil at 14. If you don't want it can you return it? An inheritance isn't a choice. It's an obligation. You know, Carlinhos, I think sometimes you complain just for the sake of it. Boy, you whine so much about your family, but they're human just like you. Are they all ridiculous pieces of work? Yes, but they're family. Or would you rather spend every holiday alone abandoned like an outcast? Yeah, I guess you're right. You really do miss your family, huh? Uh, so about that… There's something I've been wanting to tell you. Yeah, me too. I'm really glad that you were mugged. Huh? No, what I'm saying… I didn't mean I was glad you got robbed, I was really upset you lost all your things, but it's… It's just being your fake boyfriend has been so much fun. Oh. I haven't encountered anyone like you, Graça. Like, what you said about Christmas, there's no way to describe it. You're, uh… You're Graça. You're the most genuine person I've met. So we should get back, right? Because dinner, right? So, let's go get stuffed, okay? All right. Yeah, we should. But look, I gotta warn you. This tradition at my house is a bit different. You guys keep on messing with everything, dude. So what's next? No dinner? No. Yes, of course there's dinner, but it's just after our Christmas ball. Ball? Oh my God! I don't want to go to a ball. Seriously, man, I thought that after you guys broke our grandma's nose, you wouldn't show your face here. But apparently, I was wrong. - And Carlinhos... - Oh no. Pedro Afonso, I won't stand here while you two continue trying to outdo each other. I'll see you. Drop it, Pedro Afonso. Or what, huh? Your crazy girlfriend's gonna pitch a ball at my nose and break it too? Psst! Both of you quit it. Christmas is no time to make trouble. Well, he started it! Well, now I'm going to stop it. You look gorgeous. Thanks. Oh, Mama Noel, can I please ask you a quick question? I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am, but do you know if your husband received my letter? Did he bring my gift down the chimney? Where's the sleigh? - I do have your present. - Oh yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Look at that. - I know you're just gonna adore it. - Hmm. It's the best, seriously! It slaps for real. Come on, Carlinhos. There's your grandma. I have to say, you know, your grandma is chic, dude. I almost want to take off her bandage to cover up my nose and it's not even broken. Uh, it's better if you don't mention that. Right. But if you want to give her some moral support, you should totally go over there and spend some time. Yeah, in a minute. Right now I really want to spend time with you. What's up, Dona Chica? Oh, you just had to walk through there? Uh, Dona Francisca, please. Let me take this to Grandma for you. What're you doing, Pedro Afonso? Pedro Afonso! You can't really be serious. It's embarrassing. Wait there, Solange, I'm… I don't believe you. Grandma. Oh, thank you, sweetheart. So pathetic of them. Can I please have a minute? I have to deal with something real quick, okay? Party your socks off, honey. Go for it. Be right back. Oh, Dona Chica… Good woman, don't you have some soda I can put in here? For the love of God, these beverages are sour to where it's disgusting! Jesus and Mary! Listen, girl. Let me tell you something. When you got here, you were a disaster. You were hungry, and you were cold. And in a pretty awful condition. And now that I've transformed you into this princess, you will drink it sour and smile like it's sweet, understand? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Delicious! Come with me, Graça. To the buffet? It's about time we get some of that turkey going. No, Graça. We'll eat later. Come on. Carlinhos! I specifically explained to you I don't know how to do any of these strange dances. Don't worry about it. I'll lead you. Oh! So now I'm your puppet you just throw around over here, over there like a huge Christmas joke? - Because I'm not a joke. - Wait, wait, Graça. Can't you take me seriously for one single song? Just one, all right? I'm doing it wrong, Carlinhos. You're doing just fine. - I'll slow it down. - Okay. So, one more dance? Come on. But now we do it my way. Maestro! Time for the slo-mo part of the night to stop! What's going on? - DJ, throw on Bento Leão. - Does she know they're classical? Stop it! Oh, Lady Sofia, it wasn't their fault. I did it. Graça, you think it's all right to adjust the music I've chosen for my guests at this Christmas celebration? Uh, yeah. Lady Sofia, may I speak freely? Based on what I've seen, you're a woman who doesn't require permission to behave how you want. You know what your problem is? You want everyone to get along in this family at all times so you force them to be together. But they don't even connect when they're together. Do you really think that's right? I have not forced anyone here ever to do anything. Oh, of course not, Lady Sofia! Everybody's here to fight over your company's director position at random, right? More importantly, we're all together, right, guys? Isn't that right, guys? Yes. Absolutely. That is what's important. You wanna know what really holds families from Brazil together at Christmas? What's that? All the words of the king. Philip VI of Spain? Not a Spanish dude for Brazilian families, Lady Sofia. Good God. Do I seriously have to spell everything out here? I'm talking about the king of Brazil. Roberto Carlos. - Oh. - Maestro, C minor. No clue what I just said. Is she going to sing again? - Get over here, Carlinhos. - She sounds good. You know the words. Where's my man Bento Leão? Oh my God! That was… That was… - …marvelous! - All right, take it, Milu! Uh, well, it's the little things, right? Something like just being here. I… - I want to sing. - Get it, Sol! Get it, girl! Wait, Solange, don't! Oh what? Enéas, Enéas, Enéas! Come on, sweetheart! Alice! Alice! No, Mom. The line is "I smiled," not cried. - Just Lady Sofia now. Let's go! - Whoo! - Come on! - Yeah! Sing out, Mom. Oh, I wish every single night was Christmas, everyone. I honestly do. Carlinhos, come. I've decided. I want you to be the one that's gonna take my place. Are you sure you want me, Grandma? Yes, do you accept? It's yours. - Accept it, boy! You got it! - Yes, all right. I'll do it! - Maestro, play Raul! - Yeah! GRAÇA PARAÍBA FARM SEARCH NO RESULT FOUND Seriously, I don't believe it. My family does not act like this. My mind is completely blown! My grandma was singing, and everyone else was too! Hey, wait a second. I'm in heels, okay? Really. I mean, who invented these? We have to do this in the woods right now? - Ugh. - Seriously, I'm… It just blows my mind. Well, what did I say? For real, dude. I told you. You rock! And now you're the boss of the company. I'm not sure I rock, but… I mean it, Graça. Thank you for everything. You don't need to thank me at all. You just… gotta trust me. And my Saint Nicholas. This guy right here, he never ever lets me down. That's why he's always with me. Mwah! You're always touching this necklace. Why? Ah… Well, it's a keepsake. It was from my father. Ah, I see. I understand why you like Christmas now. I do. You know something else I've realized? This Christmas was one I'll never forget. Yeah? Look at that. We stopped under a mistletoe. Mmm, no, you didn't. I'm okay. You didn't step on any of my toes. No, no, no. Mistletoe. The tradition they have in America. You know? Graça, you know what happens when two people get caught under the mistletoe? No, of course not. I had no idea we had this stuff in Brazil. I figured your grandma had it shipped here or… Look, Graça, say it now. What are you hiding from me? Hey, I'm not hiding, man. So every year you travel to Aspen, and no one's ever tried to kiss you while standing beneath the mistletoe? Oh, boy. Uh… Was that all you meant? Because I've been kissed a bunch. How much is that? Uh… Um… Well, as much as someone who goes to a lot of Christmas parties. - No. You know, it's really all right. - Mm-hmm. You've got the terrible ex with lederhosen and Christmas. The past is the past. Buried and dead. All I'm seeing are two mouths here now. And I feel like now it's time they were quiet. Here's your dress, Dona Francisca. Don't be screaming so much, girl. - That wasn't loud, though. - Shh! Uh, you're hungover then. You must've drank everything you could manage to grab. Am I right? Yeah. It wasn't a good idea to party with my bosses at all. Well, it's, um… It's really time for me to get on the road. Wait! Graça! Graça! Ugh! What? What did I do this time? Come here. You didn't do anything. It's… the opposite now. I keep paying attention to my boy with you. Tell me something. Why don't you stay? No, I really can't, Dona Francisca. Do you mean to say you don't like Carlinhos? - No, that's not what I said. - Well… Because I know he likes you too. You think he likes me? I think that Carlinhos likes the Graça whose family's in Aspen. Who'd be kissing someone under a "missing toe." What? It's this American tradition he seems to think I know something about. And I don't. Do you see the problem? Well, you're being stupid. I mean it. Really. He likes you, and you like him. If I were you, I would tell him the truth. You know everything will come out eventually. Mm-hmm. And that's why I gotta go. So today, I'm hitting the road. Hmm! Your choice. All right. But don't be inventing sad stories later. What are you trying to say? The only reason you're alone is because you want that. Honestly, girl, please think about this. One thing I've learned is if you don't love anyone, you can't lose anyone, Dona Francisca. For you, it's Dona Chica. Well, I'm Gracyanne. Come here. Graça? Bento Leão live from Rio. Remember the name. With my homies! Yo, I got my other buddy here, Carlinhos! - What's up? Say something to everybody. - Hi. What's up? Well, yeah, good morning, guys. - "Savage", bro. - Savage. Savage to all you guys on social with Bento Leão. That's what's up, man. Yeah. What a kid. Am I right? Good morning, Pop. Have you seen Graça? No, Son. I've been here with, uh… Hey! No, that's not fair. I was over here talking to Carlinhos! - Good morning, Mom. - Bonjour. - Uh, hey, have you seen Graça anywhere? - Mmm, no. Son, have you eaten? This meat is a work of art. - You want some? - No, I'm all right, Mom. There's no way I'm going in. - Oh, don't be so fussy. - Well, you go in then. - Come on, my bandage. Are you crazy? - Morning. - How are you? - Oh, morning, love. Mwah! Uh, you wouldn't have happened to have seen Graça, would you? - No. - No, no. I was scared. I couldn't find you. I thought you left already or something. Uh, what? Me? No. And miss this cookout? There's rice with raisins, farofa, and great music playing, right? Hmm? You don't know it? Not this one. Uh, anyway… Our agreement was that I'd leave today. Well, after last night, I don't really want to keep that agreement. I mean, do you? No, not really. But I, uh… First I really have to tell you something. - All right. - Uh-huh... What are you two doing? We're about to start the Secret Santa. Come on, come on. Graça, come on. They're starting, you guys. Let's go. So, my Secret Santa has the highest IQ in the family. - Isolda! I know it! - Ah! - You got it, Solange. - Who else could it be? Obviously I got it. Ah! Look, your present's in your own account. It's a bitcoin! Oh no, guys! No, no, no, no. Stop this right now, fam. Really. - You're so strange. - Why? For the love of God, it's Secret Santa. Why are you… The gifts should be something like soaps, or socks. Or a shirt you got on a trip somewhere. But bitcoin, guys? For a kid? Excuse me, guys. Now it's my turn, all right? - Let me give my Secret Santa. - You guys... Oh, you stay right here. You're gonna like this. My turn now? - Very good. - Oh. Family, uh… so my present goes to a chump. And he's not just any chump. He's the king of all chumps. Because he somehow managed to get tricked. And by his own girlfriend. Huh? This one's easy, right? I've given you lots of hints. Go on, Carlinhos. Yeah! Go on. Tell our family, Carlinhos. Yeah, what this idiot said is actually true. Before I came here, I walked in on Bebela, and she was with another woman. Oh, I'm so sorry. - She's a lesbian? - Milu! Oh, my boy. Why didn't you say something to us? I just really didn't want anyone to know how it all ended, Mom. Don't feel bad, Son. These things happen. - You shouldn't feel ashamed at all. - Oh, honey. How could you do this to your cousin? Aw, how very sweet of you supporting him, guys. But I actually wasn't aware that she was cheating. That's really just a bonus and it only reiterates how much of a chump you are. I was speaking about the imposter that he brought here. This Graça. Look, boy. You better watch your mouth when you talk about me. I'm no imposter! Pedro Afonso, just quit it! You already lost! Enough of this nonsense! Shut your mouth, Pedro Afonso! All right. You're right. Fine, I'll be quiet. Now I'll give you your present, Carlinhos. Rui, please come on in. Merry Christmas, guys. You all cool? Good afternoon to all of you. What is your ex doing here? Uh, ex? He's not my ex, he's just my… ex-Christmas friend. - I… - Your ex what? Hey, buddy. I mean, the whole family is here, so why don't you explain to all of us exactly how you met Graça? Take your time, go slow, and give us the details. This woman here is a very big liar, you guys. Last Christmas, I found her in Urca crying alone, and she… she told me she wouldn't get to spend Christmas with her family in Aspen. I then invited her to my house, to our weihnachtsessen, so she wouldn't have to eat alone. But wait, wait, I don't get it. It's Christmas dinner in German. Yeah, "Christmas dinner in German". You should read more, dude. - That's impossible. - It's not like he can't afford to. This whole time you've been lying? I thought you were the most genuine girl I've ever known, Graça. No, I am genuine. Seriously. Hello, Clayton. Are they all inside? I'm not in the best position to defend myself here, but Rui will give an explanation, guys. Rui, can you tell them, please? I never stole anything or robbed your house or family, right? You stole away my innocence. Because I was in love with you, Graça. How is that even possible? I spent one night at your house, dude! And nothing even happened between us. Come on now. I just fed myself just like here. - Oh yeah? Really? - Well, yeah! I tried to tell ya. This one's a glutton. Mmm… That's how it was in the beginning, but things changed for us. How can I believe anything you say, Graça? Family in Aspen, that story about the stupid charm from your… your father… It's all... I didn't lie about my father! Clearly, I'm the biggest idiot ever. What is it you want? Is it cash? Fine, then say so. How much? You know what I want, Carlinhos? You take all that money you got and go sink under it, okay? Then you can go on living your totally shitty life. You and your entire family because you're all loco! Whoa! Everyone here is totally completely nuts. A whole bunch of crazies is what you are! Ah! Look who finally arrived, huh? Ooh la la. It's your princess, Carlinhos. Go on. Tie the knot and live your fairy tale, all right? I know you've had to pause it since I've been here. When you're angry, you're extra hot. Shut your mouth now! I hope that I'm not interrupting anything. Afternoon, Lady Sofia. Hi, Bebela. Carlinhos. Bebela, please, it's really… It's not a good time for us to talk. Well, you're right. I wasn't here for you. I'm here to speak with Solange. Psst. Sorry? He's a major simp that guy, right? Graça, again? You're just gonna run? And what are you doing? Stopping me? Huh? - You and how many more? - Wait, wait, I'm saying it wrong. No, Carlinhos, you said everything that you wanted to say. Just please try to understand, Graça. Tons of people get close to me because of how much money I have. I don't care that you're rich. I seriously don't care. I know, I know, I didn't really mean it. But you were dishonest. It's not as if you're a saint, you messed up also. There it is. Now you're just acting like a hypocrite. So time for us to go our separate ways. - Wait, that's not what I said. - No. No, it's not what you said. It's what I have to say to you right now. Just like everyone else, huh, Carlinhos? Graça. If we look at the performance of the project during the second semester, we can see an increase of 35 percent as compared with last year. So what do you think, Carlinhos? Carlos Henrique? - I think it's time to resolve it. - Oh yeah? And another thing… It's the 26th. Christmas is done. Excellent start, wouldn't you all agree? It takes some time to get used to, huh? I did think that you would be happier in my chair. I'm happy. Carlinhos, open this drawer and take out the document that's inside. Who is Youssef Bechara? It's my father. Wait, the Austrian count? I'm not sure I understand. Let me explain it. The Bragança-Salles never would have allowed Afraninho to wed a woman without pedigree. So, I invented one of my own. Hmm? No, but… No, it's not possible. How come all the women in my life keep lying to me? Get off that pedestal, Carlinhos! Not everyone has the privilege of telling the truth 100 percent of the time. When you arrived with Graça, I confess that I wasn't happy with your choice. She was like a grenade with the pin pulled out, totally without any manners and brazen. Is it all right if I sit here? Why, yes, Dona Sofia. Please sit down. I gotta tell ya, this is delicious in its own special way. Graça, I'm aware that you aren't who you say you are. But, hey, who really is? However, dear, if I let you stay, I do require you give me more details. But I will admit, my dear, she was the best thing that happened to us this holiday. Hmm? Not just this holiday. Graça would say I'm complaining just to do it, but… the truth is, this chair isn't right for me. Why? Do you want it reupholstered? No, Grandma, it's not the actual chair. I… I'm saying for my life. I'm constantly running on autopilot. I've spent most of my life preparing to sit in this throne, and now I'm… What is it, Carlinhos? I want to resign. You don't need to quit all of this to be with Graça. No, but I really need to be honest with myself here, Grandma. Look, I don't want to seem ungrateful, but the only thing I'll ever get from this job is an ulcer. I need to do something that brings me joy. And that's up to me, it's not up to my family. Yes, you're right, Carlinhos. I need to get her attention somehow. Guys. Guys, wait. A grand gesture. That's how I'm gonna be able to win back Graça. Here's the plan. I'll wait for Graça on New Year's Eve at the place where I met her. It's just, how am I gonna get this information sent to Graça? So, we need to make a strategy for communication. - Booyah! - Yes, what, Carlinhos? Sorry, I'm in a corporate conference. No, Auntie, please, would you focus here? So sorry. Just email me in five. - All right. - All right. Okay, what do we know about Graça? Well, um, I mean, we know her name is Graça. No, it's really Gracyanne. She told me, she did. Ooh! Well, we know that booty claps. I mean, that woman can twerk. She probably lives near Pedregulho. I dropped her off there. Oh, that's right kid! Check it out, you guys. I just hit ten million followers! - Babe, ten million! Wow! - Oh my! Babe! Aw! I'm gonna be doing even more ads! What are you doing? Yo, Bento Leão! Man, will you stop? Can we focus here? Who cares about followers? We're working on a plan. Check it out, Carlinhos, my brother. Here's what I have in mind. Now you've got ten million Bento fans ready to help you find Graça. At no cost, son. Picture it. Oh, picture it, Carlinhos! Envision it! Boom, pow! Boom, pow! He's a genius. That's the love of my life. He's gifted you guys. Ah! You all right, Milu? - Is this thing on? - It's lit, kiddo! Everything's on, go ahead. Uh, I wanna dedicate this song here to a person who taught me so much this Christmas. And I'm… I'm not great at guitar, I don't really know this song, and I'm not a good singer, - and I'm nervous. - Oh boy. But… Done. I, uh… I know that she likes this one, so… This is for you, Graça. We're looking for this girl. Her name is Graça. All I know is that she lives nearby. Hi there. Can you please help us locate Graça? May I please just have a quick moment of your time? Good afternoon. How's it going? The probability is very low. I mean, really low. Concentrate, Mom. Are you talking to me or in a meeting right now? I'm talking to you. Honey, for us to find Graça now is next to impossible. HAVE YOU POSTED MY NEWS? I JUST POSTED IT #FORGIVEMEGRAÇA CAMPAIGN GAINS TRACTION That's it, man! Hi. Could I please talk... For the love of God, folks. Come on! Give him a minute of your time, y'all. Yeah, he's spoiled, and a cuck, and a big super nerd, and his glasses aren't even cool, but… but he's in love for real, you guys. He's in love! Are you Graça? Oh, girl, this man's going crazy trying to find you. Look. Not for nothing. I mean, I wish I had a prince like him after me, huh? Look, do you want to know what I've learned? When a man is acting like he's a prince, well, it's probably because he's hurt a lot of princesses, so, yeah. - Well, thanks. - You keep it. May I please have just a moment of your time? We're looking for this girl. Her name is Graça. All I know is that she lives nearby. RIO DE JANEIRO TO JOÃO PESSOA BUS TICKET - CONFIRM Please get here, Graça! Please, Graça, come on, you won't find a man like Carlinhos in the whole world! Well, except for Bento Leão here. Rawr! I miss you, Graça. Come back. What's up, Son? - Right here's where I met her, Pop. - Ah, this is great. This luau your aunt prepared for you is quite a party, isn't it? Well, I asked Auntie Milu to put together something small just for family. Ah, well, listen, not all her fault. The invitation said to let anyone inside the party who said their name was Gracyanne. And they just all showed up? Well, Son, what do you think? Copacabana, VIP, New Year's Eve Party. Everybody showed up here. You think Graça will show up, Pop? Son, I just know that she will. Trust me. Oh, check it out No one's gonna crash this party now. 'Cause all of Brazil is here. Tales, what is it? Didn't you invite any friends tonight? I got rid of all my friends. - Oh! You talked! - Nailed it. Got ya', babe. There ya' go. SEARCHING FOR GRAÇA HAPPY NEW YEAR If there's one thing I know about Graça, it's that you gotta let her fly. Just like a bird, you know? What? Are you kidding? Since when are you an expert on Graça? Me and Graça go way back. No, dude. You only had one dinner with her. Just one evening, dude. I was trying to help you out, brother. You gotta be joking! And how did you even get in here? Hey, hey, hey, he's with me, kiddo. - Yeah, got it? - Got it, Carlinhos? What the heck, Auntie? Bento Leão's right there. Of course he is, sweetheart. Right here! I'll explain to you a bit later who messes with who and who gets priority. Relax, she'll get here. Now come on! - Yeah, come on! - Whoo! That's right! Happy New Year! All right! - Trust your own swing, man. You got it. - Yeah. FONDUE WITH MY LOVE MY LOVE Stop stalking the princess of cement, Pedro Afonso. Isolda, mind your own business. Lady Isolda. You know I demand manners from peasants. Now get back to work. We still have our end-of-year briefing. Listen, four-eyes, you weren't even asked to run the company yet. The decision's not final, but she has been contacted already, so… Look, I don't get it. A briefing on New Year's Eve? Are you serious? It depends on the timezone. Yeah. I'm on a call where it's the next year in Japan. Hey, Dona Chica. I have to admit that you look absolutely ravishing tonight. Oh please, would you call me "Chiquita"? Mmm. Lady Sofia? In real life and in Chanel. I came to give you an invitation, Graça. How about Christmas next year, you spend with the family you met this year? Hmm? But I was so humiliated in front of you guys. Why would I want to? Well, you can pick out the band and… and the music. Listen. I really want to thank you for coming all the way out here. And I'm also really sorry if I messed up your Christmas. It's all right. It's fine. I think we all really needed a reality check. I just hope that next time you come visit you'll maybe take it easy because I'm not sure my heart can take it. My next visit? Mm-hmm. Well, I really don't want another visit. Things with Carlinhos ended so badly, you know? But, you know, we can't say he's not trying to change. Am I right? Hmm? Graça, you have suffered several losses throughout your life. But you can't keep avoiding all of the people that you love just because you're afraid of losing them. I know that, Lady Sofia. And in theory, that's a nice thought. But the reality is that Carlinhos and I come from completely different worlds. And especially now that he's the big boss of your company and everything. Then you still haven't heard. Carlinhos abandoned his post. And he has really been changing, Graça. He's decided that he wants to chase his own happiness now. How about you, Graça, Are you going to run away on that bus? Happy New Year's Eve. Savage. Well, good evening, guys. I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who helped me. And I want to thank all of the Gracyannes for coming too. I mean, that was such a surprise. But really, there's only one Graça for me. And I'm a bit disappointed to say she's not here. Is anybody listening? I've done all this because I'm in love. Well, I know it sounds crazy, but I thought this would work. But I guess my time is up. - It's time. - Here we go. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! - Happy New Year, kiddo. - And to you. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. Sweetheart, Happy New Year. She didn't come, Mom. - Don't be sad, honey. Don't worry. - She didn't show up. Carlinhos. - I had so much to say, Grandma, to Graça. - I know. You looking for me, huh? Who me? Where'd you get that idea? But you listen to me. Don't you go thinking that because you went up there and gave out pamphlets all over the neighborhood and sang a song that I'll just forget everything because it's New Years. I just came to hear what you had to say. And time is ticking. Graça… when I'm with you, my heart starts racing and I get chills. I mean, I'm totally dizzy, and there's a pain in my chest. I'm... Dude, is this your declaration of love or a list of symptoms? You know there's a history of heart disease in your family? You gotta be really cautious, my dude. See, you and I are super different, and that's what I love. Because… you're just, like… Well, you're… You're just really… You're… you're Graça. I guess you're not so great with words either. Too bad we missed the countdown, huh? Yeah. We'll just do it again. Only us. - Yeah? - Yeah. Ten, nine, eight, Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! LOOKING FOR GRAÇA HAPPY NEW YEAR! THE END Whoa! I'm dead. So, what if she enters singing "Merry Christmas." Nobody showed. Surprise! - What the…? - No. It's not how it looks, baby. Sweetheart… …she's for us. Let's go. Yes, of course I don't remember because I was exhausted from all the breastfeeding while you were at work! Here, take that! Work with me. Here's what I think we should do. I'm gonna call them, and then I won't have anymore to say, because, well, the end of my, um, line was there. He… He said… Well, um… If I were you, I'll tell him everything. Excuse me. Tell me who hired you. The Arrais? The Magalhães? The Castelos-Brancos? - Hmm? - "The Castelos," uh… "The Castelos-Brancos." Banging the spanky-hanky? I don't get it. Pedro Afons… Uh… - What's my line? - I don't know. What was my line? I don't know. It's your line, not mine. Hey, Tales, mornin'. Have you seen Graça? You're as funny as ever. Gra... Uh, Ma... Uh… Shit, I messed up. My bad.
