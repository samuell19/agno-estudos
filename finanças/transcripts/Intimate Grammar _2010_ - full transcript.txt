At the heart of the Independence Day festivities stood the IDF parade, impeccably organized and carried out with utmost precision. 200,000 spectators viewed the Parade and applauded its participants. Multitudes celebrated with Independence Day picnics. Children had a merry time. In balmy, sunny spring weather children played in parks and woods. Spirits soared, feet danced and voices burst in song. Indeed, the entire people celebrated, young and old alike were swept into the joyous circles. Some paintings she's got. Some lunatic painted them. Modern art... Modern fraud. -Let's get out of here! She'll be back any minute... We found no clues yet. -Bullshit! She won't talk to anyone, no one knows where she's from. So that makes her a spy? Check out these boobs! Well?! Like you're not interested... Aharon. Come on, we'll get in trouble. -I'm out of here. You coming? What's with the painting? -Nothing. Just a painting. She'll be back any minute... We'll climb down the tree. -We'll get in trouble! It is now 13:20. You are listening to the "Search for Missing Relatives" program. The program has received messages from relatives and friends in Israel and abroad. To Manya Zilberg, formerly known as Fliescher, from Lodz... Sorry, Miss Blum, really. What are you doing here? Tree has problem. Problem? What problem? It's all sick. Look... -Yuck. Why yuck? Some lemon and salt, delicious. Good evening, Mr. Strashnov! -Good evening! Get some fresh air in your mouth, "in'electual"... Professor... Children, leave David in peace! Mamchu! Psst! Get inside! Seriously, Mr. Kleinfeld, is there anything you can do for my tree? Moshe? Right here, Hindale. What are you doing on the tree?! You can't imagine what's going on here. The whole tree is wounded. Gotta be cleaned... Are you nuts?! Help me with the groceries! Coming, coming... Gidon! Well... where is it? -Don't you want me to look for it, Mama? Go look for worms in the tree... Leave the winter clothes to me. She's got her cuckoo eye on you... -It's all in your head. Yeah, right... "Is there anything you can do for my tree, Mr. Kleinfeld?" Who does she think she is?! What are we doing about your mother? What can we do? -What can we do... Standing naked out in the balcony! What can we do...? People are talking, it's not good for the boy. What's it got to do with the boy? Aharon? No more bread for dinner. You won't believe the scene Nikova made in ballet class. Go to our room, get some winter socks. Why? -Because I said so. Where's your painter thing, Yochi? She called me a cow in front of everyone! I walked out of her class. Nikova may be a ballet expert, but I'm the expert on raising kids. I won't hear about no bread. So don't hear... Why the winter socks? -To try them on, what else... Go on, already. Look at this thing! You're in your teens, building your body for life. You'll diet later, believe me. I'm not trying them on. -What does she know, that Nikova? Has she got any kids? I'm back in third row... I'm not trying them on! Get those socks or you're in trouble! I want new ones. These are old! Try them on, then we'll see! Dad, they're from two years ago... Where the hell did I put it? It's all because you eat standing up. I've told you a thousand times. Where's your painter thing, Yochi?! Why do you need it now? She'll make a terrible fuss. Take it, take everything! I won't be a painter, anyway. Nor dancer. Too bad I stopped painting. You can still paint with fat legs. Here it is! What's wrong? What happened? What's this? What have you collected here? Almost 11 years old and I still have to clean your ears. Show me the other one. Well? How long are we going to wait for His Highness? Well, well. -"Well, well" what?! Well, well, it fits. I can see that. Obvious, isn't it? Maybe the sock is too thin? It's a winter sock. The thickest. l want new ones. When hair starts growing here you'll get new ones. You better eat everything I put on your plate. I'm telling you. What's wrong, Aharonchuk? Why does she have to insult me? It's all out of love. She doesn't mean it. Of course she does. -Come on, enough... Besides, even that, what's-his-name? With the funny hat... what's his name, Napoleon? Just a wimp of a guy. And look, he took all of Europe. What's this ointment for? I'll show you, but first go have lunch. I don't want to. -Come on, go. -I don't feel like it. The whole tree's full of worms. Look. Gotta take'm out and smear the ointment all around the holes. Let's hope the government doesn't slap another devaluation on us. When your mind gets stuck on something, I swear... When a tree's sick, you take a knife and chop off the sick branches. That's it. Why don't we ever go to the theatre? Why do you say that? Once your mom actually went to... That... uhh... opera... Really, mom? Come on, Mamchu... look what she's done... Don't underrate your mother. If she hadn't met your father, hungry out on the street, she'd become a famous bohemian... -Enough! Did you lose your mind on that tree? She used up all her savings to go to Tel Aviv before we even had a State. Totally dangerous. But she had to see all the... hats, dresses, curtains! Not everything you don't understand is fraud. -Sure. People enjoy all kinds of things. Not everyone's ignorant like you. Right... 5 hours listening to... What's this? What's this, Yochi? Did you just throw your bread away?! Answer me! -I told you, no bread today! No one throws away bread in this house, right? But I said no bread today... -Stop fooling already! Stop it! Stop it! Wanna come for a little walk with me at "Swoon" lake? We'll go fishing... at "Swoon" lake? We'll catch some frogs...? "Swoon" lake! Yochi.... Leave me alone. I'm hungry. Think a spy could come into our house and plant something? Yeah, plant mom. Seriously, is there a chance someone came in and left an envelope full of cards? What? -No, nothing. What's the matter? -Nothing, keep writing. What's another word for "missing"? Give me the sentence. -I don't want to, come on... Say "My brave soldier, l miss your letters with all my heart". Just you touch my letters... Who cares about your boring letters? So give me another word... "Yearn", "crave"... "long"... "My brave soldier, I long for your letters". People in this neighborhood have lost all sense of shame. Son of a bitch. Just wait till my dad comes back from Africa. Just wait... Tzahi! Tzahi Smitanka! I know you can hear me! Come on up to eat! Get this... serving her kid lunch at 5... I?m not inviting her to the Bar-Mitzvah! Just what I need, to shake her hand right after him. Good evening, Mrs. Smitanka! How's Lazer doing? Still in Africa? Whore... Maybe she loves him. Loves him? You've got a lot to learn yet. Love lasts a few moments, then it's war against each other's madness. All out war. It's like being in the woods, right? With snow all around, sleeping in the trees with the Partisans. ls that from "There"? "There" such a wound would kill you, right? Mom doesn't like me talking to you about these things. Just tell me about the big scar. Mom said I had to go to some war with you, in the youth movement. Not war, an initiation. First there's a contest, then we must break into the 9th graders' circle. And if you can't? -You can't become a member. So it is war. -It's not. -It's war! And don't you be an "in'electual", an artist. Bite 'em. Kick them in the balls, whatever it takes to break through. Just so you know, "there" the in'electuals died first. Artists and eggheads. Either they died, or lost their minds... Why did they lose their minds? Who knows why artists lose their minds in camps? They couldn't believe it could be this way. In their in'electual minds they couldn't believe it could be that way. Take this. -What is it? Go, ask her to plug into her socket. Why me? -Go on. No, you ask. -You speak well, go! Miss Blum. Excuse me, Miss Blum? What's this? Everybody's on the tree today? Dad asks if we could plug into your electricity. Gladly. "Oh, how lovely is this pocket-knife. "lf I had such a pocket-knife, how happy I would be. "I try and for one moment put it in my pocket. "My hand shakes and my heart beats so that I can hear it sound". Ma'am, may I come in? Did the child mean to steal the pocket-knife? Smitanka! -How should I know? Yes, Hirsch? -No, he didn't mean it. Please explain your answer. He only wanted to feel it, and found it in his pocket. "Shalom Hirsch - Armpit hair" l don't know about this Houdini... -Of course you do. The Naomis are doing a number with guitar and accordion. They play the accordion? Don't worry, we'll win for sure. Here they come. Yikes, they're gigantic! Do you think what Uzi said is true? If you can't break into the circle, you can't become a member? They say every year someone doesn't make it. What are you doing?! Do they own the pavement?! Don't get us into trouble, Aharon. They'll mark us. Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls. You are about to witness the first Israeli Houdini act. No smite of hand, and the danger is... What's wrong with you? -What did I do? I said right hand under left! -It wasn't on purpose. Explain that when they find me dead in the suitcase! It wasn't on purpose. How can I cut the ropes if you tie the wrong hand? And it's "slight" of hand, you klutz! I?ve had it with you and your Houdini bullshit! l won't read this stupid Houdini mumbo jumbo. If you're not in the show you're not in on the spies and... Catch a spy already! I'm always on the lookout anyway, right?! You just wait, when we catch a spy... There are no spies!! Don't you get it? No more spies. Enough!!! We'll manage on our own. -I don't know,I don't like it. Don't worry, there's enough air for two minutes. If I don't come out, just open it. Are you okay? If you don't come out in 90 seconds, I open it. Aharon? Aharon? It's stuck. Aharon, it's stuck. I can't get it open. Aharon! Aharon! Answer me! Leave it! Move aside! Stupid idiot! You're so dumb! l couldn't open it. We need to oil the... No need to oil anything! The suitcase is ruined? We need to look for... -No need to look for anything! Wait for me! Gidon! Hold On! -Why don't I ever learn? Why?! What are you smiling at, moron? -I'm not smiling. You think it's funny? -No.... Another minute you'd be dead. Laughing like a retard. But you saved me, right? -Barely... But you saved me. You saved me, right? Idiot... Look, we're dropping the Houdini act. -OK. The show's on Thursday, what are we gonna do? I don't know, Aharon. -Maybe without the gags... No! -OK, OK, relax. Making up already, or I let go! How is my tree doing, Mr. Kleinfeld? We're doing our best... This is how you're saving it? -We're trying... My workers had a little fight. You know, I'm staying on this block only because of the tree. Sometimes, I really feel my soul is bound to this tree. I'm sorry, Miss Blum, did I scare you? You scared even the people down town. Yeah, right. Moshe!!! How long are you gonna lick that tree's mucus?! How long? Mama... Come, mama... Let the cuckoo pull blackheads from your back... Climbing up that tree like a monkey... Straighten up, shorty. You don't know what you're missing! What's with the yelling? Look at this! So many of them, Some even have a yellow tip. That's because he sweats like a hog on that tree all day. Look at this one! It's huge! Should I use two fingers? Show me. Nonsense. Pull it out with your nails. Well, show me. -Move over, Mamchu. Wait... where is it? Here? He works in the city hall, wears a suit, but he's still a coachman. Partisan... Ten years here and not a sound. Now it's pouring out of her. Banging and drilling away... What's this? What's this smell, Mamchu? I'm telling you, if you did something... There's no telling what I'll do to you. Look, Moshe! There's water all over, look! It had to happen after we cleaned! Where's the tool thing? -ln the balcony! Where else? Get me the wrench! Get me the wrench already! Move, Mamchu! And the pump, it's in the balcony, too. -I've had it with this block. All because of that tree of yours! Sticking its roots in the drain pipes of the whole block! Millions! Millions of women have had this before you. How come they all manage to keep their filth to themselves, but only you have to show the world you have "the visitor"? What do you want? Tell me, what?! You want us all to applaud? Can we get some quiet here? Gidon! Gidon! Can I sleep over? Wait. Mom, can Aharon sleep over? Come on up! All these complicated tenses in English... It's those British, still making our lives miserable. What's going on? Remember our big fight in the third grade? We weren't talking for a month... How did we finally make up? l don't remember... That's why I had this idea... Go ahead. l thought that if we fight and one of us couldn't stand it anymore, we'd have these signals. If the other sees the signals, he'd have to go to the Rock that day. What kind of signals? Like sticking a coin in the electricity pole near your house, or turning a screw in the bench the wrong way, or... add tails to the treasure hunt arrows. We'll come up with seven signals, the last will be an SOS flashing a mirror into the other's room. No fight can outlast them. Not in this life, this world, nor the next. In this galaxy, in the whole cosmos and beyond... I don't get this progressive present stuff. What's wrong with "past, present, future"? If we had any national pride, we wouldn't even learn English. But think how beautiful it is... Present continuous for instance. What's beautiful about it? Imagine you're "playing" or "jumping"... It's like you're inside a bubble "jumping". People outside are looking at you and thinking: he's just "jumping", but you're in your present continuous and every second is like, say, an hour, or more. Cause only you know your actual tense, you're inside your present continuous, your "jumping". It was obvious they'd win. What did you expect? She brought her father. It's all because you ruined our Houdini act. I ruined it?! -Shut up, OK? Houdini, right... -Look, they started the fire! "Be Brave, The Young Guard" See that little one over there? -Where? That one! There! -Well? The second there's an opening near him we run for it. -OK. Let's get a little closer. I got in! Oh, no,I lost my braces. -When? Where? Fell as Iran. -Your mom's going to kill you. Let's go for it again. -What? Come on. It'll be amazing! Don't be silly! Instead of our show. Coming? Don't you dare! -I'm going out again! -Aharon! Come back here! -Someone got out! There he is! There he is! -Someone got out! Where? -Where is he? Come here! -Don't let him in! Show-off! Leave him alone! We let you in the first time, you can't go in again! We don't like show-offs in the "Young Guard"! Aharon, The counselor says you can come. Come where? There's a bonfire with the 9th graders now. They said you could come, if you apologize. I don't think so. -But they said it's OK, Aharon. Why didn't you help me? It's my fault you're an idiot getting out again?! You could have helped me, chased me, created a diversion! Why did you have to get out again in the first place? Tell me! -I don't know. You always have to be different? Well, come on already. They're roasting potatoes and singing. Come on... Are you coming? What happened to the tree? Some Mrs. Eisen called, reported a sick tree that needs to be cut down. We have an Eisen in this block? No Eisen and no tree. But we cured it. They ruin and soil everything they touch. When I grow up I'll tell myself every morning "I am playing, I am jumping" just to remember, simply remember. Aharon? Come here. Do you want to fall asleep in my bed? You're hurting me, Moshe. I am jumping,I am jumping... l am playing, I am playing... I am "pur-ing"... I am "think-ing"... I am "cocoon-ing"... I am "deep-ing"... I am "Aharoning",I am "Aharoning", I am Aharoning... Are you coming to the Goldfinger tonight? It's only from 15 up, no? If Blutrich gets in so can we. I don't know... we'll see. You go, I have plans for tonight. "September '65" Well, where is he? You know how they are at this age, can't talk to them. Tell me about it... Racheli already locks her door. That's how it is, my Yochi, too. All day long... Just boys and boys. You got "The Guinness Book of Records" twice, and "Answers to All Questions" twice... what shall we do? Does it say why mom raised my shoes? Ara'le... -What? Play it tough, and step out. It's your Bar Mitzvah... You'll have to eventually, no? I thought Bar Mitzvahs are celebrated in halls. Why are we doing it at home? It's probably cheaper. She's been saving up for years, now there's no money for a hall? Ashamed I'd be seen next to my classmates, that's all. Where's the Bar-Mitzvah boy? Where's our man? Will you play for me? -Maybe later, when they're all gone. What are you looking for? Look what I've found... It still fits? Here, now it's perfect. What now? You have the guts to go out like that? You bet. We'll make fun of it all... Inside we'll laugh at it all. Who wants juice? I am "think-ing"... I am playing... How are things in Tel Aviv? I am jumping... I am Aharoning... I am Aharoning... What's this? Hinda'le, why don't you give the boy some food? Is this a man?! Soon it's time for paca-paca... What do you think, that someone is doing it on purpose?! Why did we come to Israel, for this?! This is why we escaped from "There"! He needs Vitamins! You never could hold a drink. No, no, please... -Come, Mamchu, come... You ruin every party I give! Spoil every celebration! Stay here, keep an eye on her, I'm getting her pills. Were you trying to save me, Mamchu? What are you looking for? Leave the crazy old woman alone and get back in there! You know, Aharon, sometimes I think you are doing this to us on purpose. Mamchu... Everything's alright, Mamchu. Go ahead, go ahead. Everything's alright. Calm down, Mamchu... Enough!!! Go ahead, go on, please! ...Has received messages from relatives and friends in Israel and abroad. To Gita Zielbertarb formarly Kalish from Rzeszow, Poland, from her brother Bejamin Kalish from Netanya... How stupid of me, setting 5 plates on the table... What? Why are you giving me that look?! I had her here for 20 years! Show me another woman who'd do that for her mother-in-law! So don't you look at me like that, you hear?! No chicken for me. Don't you start with me! I won't ever eat meat or chicken again! To understand how fish breathe in water we must first consider the water conditions related to breathing. Smitanka, get up! What're you doing? -Nothing, Sir. Bring your mother on Friday. -My mother is ill, Sir. Bring your father on Friday. -My father's in Africa, working. Father or mother, anything of the sort. Where were we...? What's he studying? Who? The whale. Biology. And why does he have another heart under his heart? Another brain, not a heart. -What for? Spare... Cute... he's ballet dancing. -Really? Yes, look, his right leg is in pli? the left is straight and pointed. Nice. -Thank you. They're not opening. Hello. -Hello. l hope I'm not disturbing. -No. Excuse my appearance, come in. Hello. Come in, Miss Blum, why stand by the door? Would you like a nice cup of tea? No, thank you. I'm here for just a moment. Why are you coughing like an invalid? What's wrong? I heard how Mr. Kleinfeld fixed the electricity for Mr. Atias and the pipes in Mrs. Botanero's kitchen, so I would like Mr. Kleinfeld... I'd pay, of course, to tear down a small wall in my living-room. But I am not... I am not a real professional. I think, Mr. Kleinfeld, in fact I'm sure you'll do just fine. You need a professional. Me, I just fix little things. Moshe is no expert for the job you need. Maybe you should look for someone else. Everyone can be replaced, no? Not exactly, Mrs. Kleinfeld, perhaps even no one can be replaced. I'll pay well. -It's not the money... And how much would that be? Even... Fifty liras. That's really too much, Miss Blum. And when do you expect to pay? If Mr. Kleinfeld would take the job, half now and the rest when the job is done. Moshe will work 3 hours each afternoon till he finishes the job, and me and the boy or Yocheved will be there with him, to help. Alright. Goodbye. What's up, Giraffe? What's the weather like up there? I go that way. Goodbye. -Bye. One, two, open on three... Yaeli, go ahead. very nice, Yaeli. Open your arms... They're only reproductions. I'll get you a plate for the peel, sorry I forgot. Don't worry, Miss Blum, no need, I eat the guava whole. Would the kids like some chocolate from Switzerland? -No, thank you... It's bad for their teeth and Mr. Kleinfeld would like to begin. They used to build such good walls... Miss Blum, every coin has two sides... there must be things on the other side of the wall too. Miss Blum, maybe you haven't thought it all out. Tearing a wall down is messy and noisy. Perhaps it's best we put everything back and go home. Come, Mr. Kleinfeld, let's look at the other side of this coin. Sit up, half size! Well, we can get to work. One minute, please. For the sake of history? What? Hold up the hammer. Up, up! "Birdie, birdie"! "Birdie, birdie"... What was I to do? Insult her? Standing there holding the hammer like a dork, letting her photograph you like some slave. If she told you to moan like a cat, would you? I saw you at ballet class. I want to be a dancer. I used to play the guitar. But stopped. I got a new one for my Bar Mitzvah. I'll soon start again. Good. My name is Aharon. I know. I'm Yaeli. I know. That's all, Miss Blum. When the painter comes, he will fix this spot easily. Should I put the door back? -No, there's no need. Okay, pay up and we're out of here. I have an offer. I'll pay Mr. Kleinfeld fifty liras more to tear down the other wall. Have you no shame, Miss Blum? Anyone can see what's on your mind. Sixty liras? I spit on your money, Miss Blum! Seventy? Over my dead body! Eighty? Your money is dirty, Miss Blum. One hundred? Only if Moshe agrees. I don't. It's only a tiny wall. Two days work at most. Come, children. I won't ever set foot in her house again. You're sleeping in the living-room until all this is over. And don't try speaking to me, because I won't answer. Are you coming to see "Goldfinger" again? Maybe. Maybe he'll get a role there... Watch out for the car. Goodbye. -Bye. Move over. Did you hear of the scooter Tzahi built? It was on the radio, no? Know what he told me? -Who? Tzahi, who... He made out with Dorit Alush. Listen... I think guys our age are not yet ready for love. I vowed not to fall in love until I get through air force flight training and then I'll marry my first girlfriend. You can tell that little one, what's her name, Yaeli, has been growing up lately. Really? Haven't you noticed? She doesn't seem like the rest of them, somehow. She keeps quiet, but she smiles to herself. It's a shame she's in the scouts and not a socialist movement. I saw her dance at Rina Nikova's, and haven't stopped seeing her since. How do you mean? Every night she dances for me before I go to sleep. We also have these glances all the time, during recess. We even spoke by the water fountain once, and it was like in the movies, in slow motion. You're serious, huh? Yesterday,I put a note with her name on it in my sandwich and ate it right next to her. See this? Honeysuckle from near her house. And this is a sock I stole from her laundry. If you are so crazy about her, let's walk her home tomorrow? Both of us? If you agree... If I agree?! If your age group is strong and confident, it should allow its members to try other directions. Other directions? You think ballroom dancing is a direction? Maybe you wanna sit with them and whistle to passing girls! They can! Who said it's better to go to your little shack and argue about people emigrating out of here? And you're just laughing. Maybe you could share it with us? I... I haven't thought about it yet... You know where you're wrong? You're wrong... What do you say, Kleinfeld? -What? Should youngsters with principles wear blue collar shirts and sandals? Kleinfeld gets bored talking about Values. But he's not less moral than you. I think it's selfish not to think about Values. And I would really like to hear His Highness about this. I think that only when we're grown up, and process things better, we can truly get at those values. I totally agree. Are you going to argue much longer, or do you want to come in? No, thanks. Well... goodbye. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Get up there, tell your father he's been banging a wall that takes 2 days for a whole week now. Just that! Why do you keep checking your watch, got a date with her? We're going to a movie. -Is that guy coming with you? Why "that guy"? It's Gidon. In these matters there are no friends. If you wait like a lamb, you'll end up with your jaw hanging. You can snort away. We've seen what an expert you are in these matters. Where are all your lover-boys, huh? Go, get up there, and then take your girl out. Dad? I hope you like chicks, Mr. Kleinfeld. I'm sorry. I knocked. You didn't hear. Just in time. Hungry? There's plenty of food. No, thank you. Dad, mom says it was a two-days work wall... Yes, but now we moved to the kitchen wall. Tell mom it's more complicated, there's a lot of electricity in it. Did you lose something, Hinda? One of my towels blew away. What a smell, huh? -What smell? You don't smell the pine-nuts? -No! Someone's cooking up a sweat. Mom? Well? He's already started another wall. This is an advance. What are you doing? Don't give it to me here! Why aren't you eating? Eat! You need your strength. With pine nuts. You like that, right? Eat. Yochi? Yochi! It's actually a pretty name, Yochi... Like Yogi, yogurt, Yodel, yuck, it's like... What do you want? Why don't you ever write me a letter to ask how I am? Aharon, you're a nag. Why did we stop visiting grandma? Welcome to earth... Now you remember to ask? I go there twice a week. Liar. Instead of ballet class, straight from school, until the evening. And how is she? Much worse than she was. But she's awake, she lies in her bed, watching the sky, there's a tree in front of her window to look at. I tell her things. I'll come too. -Don't threaten. How could they just give up on her like that? What exactly don't you get? You're letting me lead. Be the man, lead! Gotta show her you know how to act around girls, or else your friend will steal her from you. He probably dances well, that guy? You're calling him "that guy" again? You just don't know how to let go, that's your problem, you're too stiff, no one will look at you. Believe me, if you stay a wallflower now, you'll remain alone your whole life. That's it! Yes! Good! Great! When you're with your girl don't let her know you want her. God forbid! Or she'll humiliate you. You have to play her a bit. Women like men who win them over. What are you laughing about? She's far from innocent. If she can play the both of you like that, she knows exactly what's what. Why not go over there right now? Why? Because Gidon's not home. -And what if he's at her place? Maybe he's with her, sitting and laughing about the fool? -He isn't. And if he is? Think he'll run back and tell you? Listen to me! Go to her! How much money do you have? None. Here, take. If he buys her falafel, buy her shawarma. Don't skimp, it's on me! Go already! Suck this life dry before someone else sucks it for you! Go! Gidon! Gidon! What's up, Kleinfeld? -Nothing. I was looking for you. Let's go visit her. -Listen, I wrote her something. Like a little poem. You wrote her a poem? I thought we could say it's from both of us. Let me see. You wrote this? Yes. -You swear? I swear. I can't say it's from me too. Why not? Give it to her. It's fine by me. No, it's either from both of us, or not at all. Listen, Aharon... In two weeks... Let's do something! -What? I need you to help me with something. What? -Something... Imagine pulling a Houdini in this fridge. Don't even think about it. -Just kidding. Now shut the door! Are you sure it's right? Yes, my dad taught me, just shut it. Is the tooth loose enough? Yes, yes! It's the last one, I'm sick of it. I don't know, Aharon, it doesn't seem right to me. Like the pact in the cave; A little pain and it's gone. Now close it! OK. Watch out. Ready? Set.. Aharon? Aharon! You liar lunatic! You cheated! It wasn't even loose! It didn't hurt. It really was loose. How come I never learn not to listen to your nonsense? I'm sorry, Aharon, but it's your fault. You and your craziness, I'm sorry. Are you OK? Idiot... Excuse me! Sir, one moment! Excuse me! I think you got the sum wrong. -It can't be... let me see.. You're right. Here you go. Thank you. Miss Blum? Is everything alright, Miss Blum? Oh, hello, come on in. Would you like anything to drink? A little something to eat? No, thank you... Come, eat something... Dad... Enough is enough! Was the food good? Miss Blum... It all got a bit out of control. Who would've thought... I better go now. So what? I enjoy dancing ballet, but I still go crazy from Beatles songs. Thank God the board of education wouldn't have them here. Really?I was really disappointed! Obviously! You'd have gone with your friends to scream and faint. And scratch my face! And you don't care what youth abroad think about us. I want to be a dancer. I used to play the guitar. But stopped. I'll start again soon. I know, I believe in you. -Honestly? Indeed. It's hard for me to explain... I know... I've been trapped inside for so long... it's hard for me to get things out. You don't need to, I understand you without words. Kleinfeld, why don't you tell us what you're thinking instead of shaking your milkshake like a lunatic? I'd like to commit suicide when I'm 30! Cause actually, all our most important moments happen without us noticing. Have you thought about it? When we're born and when we die, even now, as we become a little more like those adults, like those machines in the movie we saw... get it? Kleinfeld and his theories... Kleinfeld's ideas... What movie should we see tomorrow? "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is playing... -I've seen it. My parents are throwing a party for Independence Day, I thought we could go to Tel Aviv and camp out on the beach, stay up till morning. That would be cool, right? Are you coming? We were supposed to go to this camp with the movement before Independence Day, but because of the recession and the economy, they're changing everything. All the youth movements are going together. You understand? No. I tried to tell you, everyone's going up north, we'll be assigned to different kibbutzim to help the farmers. Only because of the recession. We're going to work, not to have fun. What Gidon is trying to say is that all the movements are going together for a about a week. But we wanted you to hear it from us. I told Gidon we should just talk about it and get it over with. Really? When? -When what? When did you discuss this? The point is that you'll be staying here and we don't want you to have any silly ideas. I'll be staying here and where will you be? Haven't you heard? What's up with you? The scouts and the other movements are all going together. And we just wanted you to know, that everything will be the same between us. Can you believe we didn't know how to tell you for a week? On Sunday we'll camp in Kaduri, next to Mt. Tavor and then we'll be divided to the different kibbutzim. But when did you discuss this? -That's not the point. If you insist, I am willing to stay here. Gidon is part of the leadership, but I could stay. No, go, both of you. And you promise not to eat your heart out here? We know you already... Go, go. Don't make a fuss. How long is it anyway? Nothing. About eight days. Maybe a little more. Just before Independence Day and a little after. We're gonna work hard, that's for sure. Two weeks of hard... Go. I'll be fine. So she was right, as always, she was right... Try hiding it from her now. One look and she knows. This body has to wake up. That stupid gland has to understand. We've had our fun, but soon it will be too late. Where were you until now? Where's my bed? At a second hand dealer's, where it belongs. I want my old bed and I want my old table. Instead of saying thank you?! Your dad breaks his back for us to have money so we can replace your junk... That's not why he broke his back. I want my bed. What did you say? I want my bed and table. What did you say? I didn't hear! Nothing. Sit down already. What's holding you? What an Independence Day celebration we'll have here. Everybody's eyes will pop out. Why do you want to pop out your friends' eyes? You'll know when you're my age. Now it's all about having fun and fooling around, when you grow up, you'll see... -What will I see? Stop glaring like a madman and eat! Pass me the Borscht. -What? The Borscht. With pleasure. Gracious thanks. Care to pass the bread? Is it this fine aliment that my dear desires? -Kindly so. Is it to your liking, dear? Pass the salt thing. The salt shaker. What did you say? Say it again, what you just said. Take it, dad. -What's it called? It's... a salt shaker. Now listen to me, wise guy. Open your ears and listen good: From now on this is "the salt thing", you hear? Take it... -First say, "the salt thing"! Say it already! -Dad, take it. Say it or I'll whip my belt out! Just say it and we'll have some quiet! I'm getting drafted two days before Independence Day. What did you say? That I'm getting drafted. How come? We signed you up for the academic program. It's a fact. You're signed up for school, and you'll go to school. I can't go to school,I flunked my final exam in grammar. What do you mean you flunked? How come? It happens. -You're not 18. They can't take you. They're drafting me earlier because of the political climate. Can you pass "the salt thing", please? It will probably take some time at first, before they let me go home... Will you write something for me on the guitar till I get back? Maybe. Cause you haven't touched it since I got it for you. So you'll write me something? Maybe a letter or a story even? Do you want me to stay with you? That I won't go to the army? Aharon... You realize I have to, right? If someone can understand, it's you... Aharon! Aharon! Can't you hear me calling? What's wrong with you? Open a window, it's stuffy in here. How come you're not with that guy? You haven't seen them for days. -Leave me alone. Look at this room, you're smelly. Your wife will be miserable... Why are you lying around? I'm tired. At your age, you should suck up the whole world... Tired... What have you got in there? You got a whole cargo in there... Sit up for a moment. This morning I saw that friend of yours, Tzahi, with his mother. Left you far behind... Here, give me the other one. Walking around with his mother... She barely reaches his shoulders, how his voice changed... Behhhh! Like a bull! My stomach turned. And you turn vegetarian on us. As if it's not enough as it is... look at your tiny legs... Why that look? Look at yourself first, Helen Keller. Are you with them on Independence Day? Cause we're having a party. They went up north with the movement. For how long? Five, six days. Told you so. Where I can find my grandmother? Her name is Lilly. Mamchu... Mamchu, it's Aharon. It's me, Aharon. Do you know who I am, Mamchu? I'm sorry I didn't Visit you for so long, it's just that l... Yochi can't come anymore. She was drafted earlier because of the political climate, so I'm here, to tell you things. It's Independence Day today. I brought you a flag. You have to break up with her. You need a girl with a different character... someone more... More what? More sad. But why am I not growing? What am I doing wrong? Maybe I'll stay like this forever, with only my thoughts growing up? Look how they're celebrating their bodies... But what did they have to give up? Maybe nothing? Maybe they didn't have to give anything up? No, they must have given something up. Yes! They're already on their way. They're just on their way to death, is all. They've started off on their road to death and I haven't yet. But how is it my fault? Why does she say I'm doing it on purpose? I mean, I want to... Want to be like them? That's what you want? Yes, like them! "Growth gland, wake up!" Aharon to Aharon, do you copy? I copy. What should I do? What are we looking for? We're saving memories. Aharon to Aharon, look for memories, copy? Everything's deserted here. This place that was so full of colors, scents and ideas, it's desolate, Aharon, what should I do? Got to save what we can. All the memories, good and bad, we will move to the new brain, under the heart, we're building a new brain. Aharon to Aharon, what do you see? The first days with Yaeli, but maybe you don't wanna hear about it now. Everything, everything. Her eyes and lips, and the way she danced for me in ballet class, the smell of her armpits after we ran in the valley and she lifted her arms, her miniskirt which I thought was too short, but it's good for her, it's her time now. I found the pact with Gidon in the cave. Aharon to Aharon, take everything you can save. The bad with the good. Like a breath of air, we'll make a new place for them. A fresh place, pure and natural. Aharon to Aharon, run away. Grave danger! Not now, there's still time. Run. Grave danger. Don't move your head, this might hurt a little. What? Pushing paper into your nose at your age? You're not three years old, you're ten. How long has he been this way? -A few years. The fever. The high fever - How long has it been going on? Three days. Call me again if it persists... Aharon to Aharon, what have you found? Over. The beach where we used to get lost on purpose to hear mom yelling for us. Screaming our names in an animal's voice. Aharon!!! Aharon, pull yourself together. I'm asking you, look what's become of you lately. They'll put you in a mad house. Get out of here. Get out of here right now! Listen to me, maybe you are a special kid, with your brains and talents, maybe we're not smart and educated enough to understand everything that's going on with you. We haven't read books and didn't go to university, Aharon. You know your father never had a father himself, maybe he doesn't know how to be one, he makes mistakes. Me too, I grew up most of my life without parents but we do try our best, and you know we only want what's best for you, even when we're angry. What have we got in the world other than you and Yochi? Get out of here, you whore! Get out! Aharon to Aharon,what now? What else to do? Aharon to Aharon, there's one more goodbye left. I wish we had bigger signals. When you're a kid, you see these things instantly. When you grow up, you have other things on your mind, you don't walk with your head in the ground. If I make it... Of course you will. It will be your most amazing Houdini act. And just now, I have no audience. You don't need an audience. This performance is for you. And if I make it... I won't tell anyone in the world about it. Not even Yochi. Maybe 20 years from now. Maybe 30. Maybe then I'll decide it's OK to tell, 20 years from now. 20 years from now.
