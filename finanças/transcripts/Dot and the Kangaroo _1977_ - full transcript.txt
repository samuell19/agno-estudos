Rabbits eat any kind of grass. - But Bunny loves the grass from the gully. I'll just go a little way. Oh Father, please. - Oh, let her go, Jessie. - Truly, I won't be long.

To eat? (clicking) Mmm. Very nice, thank you. - You poor little thing. (clicking) You must be starving. (clicking) - You can talk! - Of course I can talk. All animals can talk. It's just that nobody listens to us. - I always used to listen. I listened to the animals and birds, but I could never understand them. - You can now, if you keep eating these roots. We call it the food of understanding. - Kangaroo! - Oh, I've never seen one like that before. - What funny fur. - Only two legs. - What a funny bird. - Wonder where it lives. - It seems to understand us. - I knew what was the matter with you at once. I feel just the same myself. I've been miserable just like you, ever since I lost my baby Joey. You must've lost something too. Tell me what it is. - I've lost my way. - Ah. I knew you'd lost something. Isn't it a dreadful feeling? And you don't feel like eating anything, even the greenest grass. (gasps) I've been like that ever since I lost my baby kangaroo. But tell me, what does your way look like? I may be able to find it for you. - It doesn't look like anything, really. I just can't find my home. At night I slept in the bush, and all today I've been walking. I don't know where I am. - Well. Isn't that just like a human? You're not fit for this country at all. Of course if you only had one home in one place, you must lose it. Humans are no good in our bush. Just look at yourself now. How do you compare with a kangaroo? Just look at your fur, all torn. I wonder why you humans are made so badly. - It's only my dress. (crunching) Mmm. This tastes very nice. - You mustn't eat any more of that. If you eat too much, you'll know too much. - [Dot] Can you know too much? - Oh, indeed yes. And it will make you miserable. I don't want you to be miserable anymore. That's why I'm going to help you find your lost way. - Thank you, kangaroo. But could I please have some water? I'm very thirsty. - Of course you are. Everyone's thirsty at sundown. I'm thirsty too. But the nearest water hole is a long way off, so we better start at once. (Dot screams) (Dot whimpers) Poor little human. Your legs aren't much good. And I really don't understand how you can expect to get along without a tail. (Dot squeals) Ah. I have an idea. Just step into my pouch and I'll hop you down to the water hole in no time. (Dot gasps) - Lovely in here. Thank you. - And I feel as if I had my baby again. Well, we're off.

So smooth. - Smooth with the passing of thousands of kangaroos, coming here to drink since time began. All the animals of the bush. It's like a kind of mother to all of us. We'll drink now. (duck quacking) - We're so frightened, we're so frightened! - So thirsty. - Thirsty. So thirsty and so frightened. - Why don't they drink at the water hole? - Because they're frightened. - Frightened of what? - Humans. But I think it's all right now. - Kangaroo, you're so brave. Will you go to the water first and let us know if it's all safe? - We haven't had a drop of water for two days, and we're dying of thirst. - Yesterday we waited for hours, and then two humans came and we flew away. - So we're frightened, and thirsty.

But I thought you might like somewhere warm and dry. (hooting) - Ooh, that's scary. - I wish Mopoke wouldn't make that noise when you're trying to sleep. There's something wrong about some birds who think they're musical. They're so well-behaved in the daytime, but as soon as it's night, or a bit of moon in the sky, it's hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo. - I wish he'd stop. - Mopoke, would you mind singing a little further away? You're upsetting my little friend. (hooting) - Doesn't she like my song? I think it's beautiful. So sad and mournful. I'm such a great artist. When all the bush is quiet and everyone has time to be miserable, I make them even more miserable. Now isn't that a nice thing to do? - I'm sure it's lovely, Mopoke, but she is very tired. - Hmph. I suppose it's not everyone who can appreciate good music. (yawning) - Perhaps this is all a dream, and I'll wake up in my bed at home. (sighs) (yawning) Do you think I'll ever find my way? - We'll ask the animals for help in the morning. And who knows, the humans might be looking for you at this very moment. Why don't you, oh. (gentle music) (animal squawking) - Coo-ee! Coo-ee! Coo-ee! (hooting) Coo-ee! Dot! (hooting) - It's no use, Frank. We'd never find her now anyway. It's too dark. - I suppose you're right. Just have to get some sleep and start again in the morning. She's been lost for two days, Jack. - Frank, I've been a bushman all my life, and I thought she'd be in the valley here somewhere. But there's no sign of her. So at first light, we'll start searching the water holes. - Yes. It's going to be another cold night. Poor little Dot. I hope she's found some kind of shelter. Coo-ee! (gasping) - What's the matter? - I was dreaming, about my father. I dreamt he was standing there calling me. Calling "coo-ee!" - You're tired, you must rest. Try to sleep now. (birds chirping) (yawns) (gasping) (hissing) - I wouldn't move if I were you, my friend. Good morning. Lovely day today. Might rain later, though. You can't tell anymore. The weather's gone all funny. I suppose you're wondering where your friend is. She's gone to get you some breakfast. That's where she's gone. And to arrange a council of the animals for you. Asked me to keep an eye on you. Lucky, wasn't it? She's a lovely lady, isn't she? What was I saying? Oh yes, don't move. (hissing) (laughing) Nasty fellows, these snakes. Never had any time for snakes. They're not gentlemen, you know. It's not good manners to go around biting people. I'd never dream of biting anyone. (laughing) Except snakes, of course. - What will I do? - Nothing, just relax and enjoy yourself. There's nothing at all to worry about, if you don't move. He'll come out into the sun soon, I think. (hissing) Ah, there, you see? Goodness gracious, just look at those fangs! Why, the largest fangs I've ever seen! Keep still now. Remember what I said. (laughing) (suspenseful music) (Dot screaming) (animal squawking) - Oh, there you are. - Come Dot, we must go. - Are we going home? - No. - Where are we going, then? - We're going to the council of the animals. - Council of the animals? What's that? - It's when the animals come together to decide important matters, matters like how to find your lost way. (cheerful music) - Can you really help me find my way home? - I hope so.

We're practicing something new. - Can we stay? Please? I love dancing. - Yes, of course. But I'm not very fond of dancing, so I'll just watch. But remember, we mustn't be late for the meeting. (cheerful music) (splashes) Dot? The meeting. (cheerful music) Here we are. The council of the animals. They're going to help you find your lost way. They're very clever. They always know what to do when there's trouble in the bush. (animals chattering) (mischievous music) Well, here she is. This is Dot. You probably all heard about her by now. She's trying to find her way, and she needs your help. - But she's human. What have humans ever done for us? - That's true. If she's lost, it's her own fault. Animals don't get lost. - Of course they do. You all know my child, don't you? My Joey? Where is he? - That's right, he's lost. - Poor Kangaroo. She's so brave. - What a shame. - Poor lost baby. - He's lost. Some humans came to hunt in the bush. They chased me, and I hid Joey in some bushes to keep him safe, then I led the hunters away, and when I returned, my Joey was gone. - [Animal] How terrible for her. - [Animal] Fancy not knowing. - [Animal] Young little one. - I've searched for days. I can't find him. So you see, my child is lost too, just like this human child here. - I wonder what happened. - We should've helped. - We really should help. - [Animal] Poor little human. - Kangaroo, so kind. - We should be kind too. - Now, will you help? - Yes. Let's help. - Of course we will. - She's a dear little thing. - We'll help her. - Yes, we'll help Dot. - I'd like to help, but I don't know where your home is. - Oh, neither do I. - [Animal] I don't go near humans. - [Animal] I've never even seen one. - Oh! - [Animal] I don't know where they live, do you? - [Animal] No, so we really can't help. - [Animal] Poor little Dot. - [Animal] Sorry. (thunder crashing) We can't help you. (thunder crashing) - What'll I do? Oh, please. - Just a moment. I said we can't help you, but we know who can. You must go to the wisest animal in the bush, the platypus. - [Animal] Of course. - [Animal] The platypus, he's very wise. - [Animal] He knows everything. - Yes, the platypus. - Go to the platypus. - To the platypus! - That's really the best advice we can give, Kangaroo. And now we must close the meeting. Goodbye, Dot, and good luck. (thunder crashing) - Goodbye! - Goodbye! - Goodbye Dot! - Goodbye! - Hurry, this way. (light music) (birds chirping) (water flowing) (Dot panting) - Ooh, where are we? - [Kangaroo] It's a sacred cave. But nobody ever comes here anymore. - Why not? - Because they were afraid of the bunyip. - The bunyip? - Yes. There were people living here many years ago, all around this cave, and they had a camp just outside, where the animals had their meetings. There it is. - [Dot] What happened? - One evening, the men in the tribe went fishing down in the billabong. (mysterious music) They heard a strange roaring noise coming from the water, and out of the middle of the billabong came a monster, as big as 20 men. - That was the bunyip? - Yes.

All the animals say he knows everything. I'm sure he'll be able to help us find your way. (thunder crashing) (insects chirping) - You ask me, a little kid doesn't stand much of a chance out here. It's bad country. - Hmm? What? Oh. Yes. (coughing) But we'll keep going. We must keep on searching. - Can't understand it. We followed her trail plain as day, right up to the top of that ridge. Then those animal tracks everywhere, and Dot's tracks stop, not another sign. It's as if she just vanished. - Yes. I know. (coughing) (somber music) If we find her at all, it'll be a miracle. (birds chirping) (water flowing) - [Dot] Are you sure Platypus lives here? - Yes. - Why doesn't he come? Perhaps he doesn't know we're here. - He knows, all right. He knows everything. He just won't be hurried, that's all. He'll talk to us when he's good and ready. Here he is. Look, that's Mrs. Platypus with him. (splashing) Remember to be very polite to him. Oh, it's very hard to be polite to Platypus, because you don't know how to behave towards him. If you treat him as an animal, you offend his bird qualities. If you treat him as a bird, you offend his animal qualities. It's so difficult talking to two creatures in one. - [Dot] Hello. - Good morning. - Good morning. - I'm Dot. - I'm Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus. Now tell me, little human, are you going to write a book about me? Because if you are, I'll leave immediately. I can't stand any more books being written about me. - I couldn't write a book. - You're quite sure? I can't stand humans who write books about me. - Quite sure. - Then I'll try to believe you, but it's difficult to believe human beings. They tell such dreadful stories. One human said I was a duck! A duck, mind you! Another said I was a rat, or a mole, and other such nonsense! - And a bird said that I don't lay eggs at all and that we're beavers in disguise. - Such insolence! And us too. When our ancestors were on Earth millions of years before you humans were ever thought of. - A million years is a very long time. - I didn't say a million. I said millions! My ancestors were the famous Amphytherium, the illustrious Thexalotherium, and the renowned Stereognathus. So there. - [Dot] I didn't know that. - Of course you didn't. That's because humans are so new. When you've been around for a few million years more, like us old respected families, you wont' be quite so ignorant. Now, what is it you want? - I'm trying to find my way. - Hmm. I don't know. - Oh, but Kangaroo said you knew everything. - That's true. I know that I don't know where you live. But wait, what sort of bush creatures come around your burrow? - I don't live in a burrow, I live in a house. - How frightfully uncomfortable for you. - I like it, and the bush creatures like it too, because they visit us all the time. Crickets and grasshoppers, mice, lizards, swallows and possums, and foxes. Cockaburies too, and magpies, and Willie Wagtail. - Stop! At last one has the answer. Find Willy Wagtail. He'll lead you straight home. He lives on the other side of Echo Mountain. You'll get there by nightfall if you hurry. - Oh, thank you. Thank you, Platypus. Oh, sorry, I meant Paradoxus? - Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus, if you please. - She seems to be a pleasant child. Just a trifle lacking in education. Shall we inform her, my dear? - Yes. Let's.

What are you? - I'm a girl. - Oh, I've never heard of a girl before. Or seen one either. What sort of tree do you live in? - [Dot] I live at home. That is, when I'm there. - Then where are you now? - [Dot] I'm not at home. - Oh. Then you live where you don't live. Where's that? - [Dot] I've lost it, and I don't know where it is. - You make my head feel empty. I don't understand you at all. I live in this gum tree. Would you like some of my gum leaves? They're delicious. - No thank you. When I'm at home, I have milk, and bread, and eggs, and lettuce, and... - I've never ever heard of those. I'd love to see the trees they grow on. Will you show an egg tree or a bread tree to me? - They don't grow on trees. Oh, you don't understand. (sighs) - Now you've made my head feel empty again. (yawning) I think I'll have a little sleep. That'll make me feel better. Good night. - Wait. Can you tell us how to find Willie Wagtail? - Hmm? Willie Wagtail? Oh yes, over there, (yawning) on the other side of Echo Mountain. (yawning) - Do you know the best way over the mountain? (snoring) At least we're going in the right direction. (mischievous music) (Mopoke hooting) (mysterious music) (ducks quacking) - What's that? - I can't tell. It's too far away. - It's very strange. - Yes. I'll have to go a little further on and sniff the air and listen carefully. I won't go far, so don't be afraid. Just stay here quietly till I come back. (birds squawking) - Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! - Danger, danger, danger! - What's happening? Why are the animals running away? - There's something wrong. Some kind of danger up again. (Wombat panting) - Danger, danger, danger! - Wombat, wait! - Danger, dan... Oh, it's humans. All the animals are leaving. Danger, danger! - We can't turn back now. We'll have to keep going, that's all. But we must be careful. (sticks clacking) (animal howling) (howling) - What are they doing? - They're holding a corroboree. We should go now. - Oh! Look. (chanting) Can we stay a little longer? Please? I've never seen a corroboree before. They're dancing, you know I love dancing. - All right. But not too long. See those dingoes down there? If they find out I'm here, they'll attack. (chanting) - What are they doing now? - I think it's a, yes, it's a kangaroo dance. A very nasty sort of dance, that one. It's horrible. I can't bear to look. - We'll go then, if you like. Oh! What are they doing now? They're going to kill him. (screaming) (sniffing) - They must've seen me.

One of the dingoes is coming up the ridge. (screaming) (gasps) - No! No! Don't kill her! Don't! (screams) (howling) (suspenseful music) Oh! - They're coming. Hurry. I'll have to try to jump the gap. - Oh, don't jump, I'm too heavy. You must put me down. You'll be killed! - No. No, never again. I'll never leave a child alone again. I'm going to jump. (grunts) (wind howling) (sniffing) (suspenseful music) (Kangaroo grunts) - I can't go any further. - We're safe here, aren't we? - No. Those dingoes won't give up. I can hear them. They're crossing the gully now. - The dingoes, they're coming! - Is that so, now? We'll have to do something about that, won't we? - But how can you? You're such little birds. - We bittens may be little birds. - But we have very big voices! (squawks) (suspenseful music) (squawking) - Bunyip? - Bunyip? - Bunyip! - Bunyip! - Bunyip. (squawking) - There you are. You're safe now. - Those silly dingoes thought we were a bunyip. And did you see those dingoes tumble down the mountain side? What fools. - They won't bother you any more, friend Kangaroo. - Thank you. Thank you. - Oh! (sobbing) - Let her sleep. She's had a dreadful time. - We'll stay with you till morning. (Dot sobbing) (somber music) (coughing) - Dot! Dot! Dot! (coughing) Dot! Dot! Look, Frank, you can't go on. You're sick, you need a doctor. Another day out here and you'll be dead. That wouldn't do anyone any good. Not Jessie, not the child. (coughing) - [Frank] You're right. - I've never seen you sick like this before. We'll head for home right now. - I don't know how I'm going to tell Jessie. (moans) - Kangaroo must be thirsty. Give her some water. - Water? I'll have to go way down to the river. There's no water here. - Of course there is. It's all around you. There, scrape away that moss. Dear me, you humans are so helpless. - [Dot] Oh, there's water here! - Of course there is. Now, give Kangaroo a drink. That's fine. Now pick some of those herbs and give them to her. (sighing) There. Keep looking after her, and she'll be all right. You'll soon be on your way again. - And so must we. Take care. - Thank you. (somber music) (sighs) - Here we are. The far side of Echo Mountain. - But where's Willie Wagtail?

I'm Willie Wagtail. - My little friend here is lost. Platypus said you might be able to help us find her home. - A little human. I like humans. They're friendly to me, so I'm friendly to them. What's your name? - Dot. - Dot? That's a pretty name. And isn't that strange? I heard someone calling your name just the other day. - Oh, they were looking for me? Where are they? - They're gone by now. But I know where they live. In a house with big verandas. - And a garden with roses? And a wooden fence? - Not so fast. That's the one. - But how do we get there? - Oh, that's easy. Just follow the trail west. It goes past the bottom of the hill there. I'll take you home. Follow me. (somber music) (crying) - We searched everywhere. (coughing) She's just gone.

My home is out there. - But you'll wait for me, won't you? I'll bring my mother and father to you here, just here. I won't be long. (goats bleeting) (eerie music) - Look. It's impossible. - It's Dot. Dot! Dot, you're safe. (dog barking) What happened? Where were you? Are you all right? - Yes, Daddy, yes! - Oh, my baby. (dog barking) Dot, darling, what happened to you? We thought that you were, you were... - I was lost, and I didn't know what to do, and the kangaroo gave me food to eat, and took me to see all the animals, and I talked to them, and... - Wait, wait dear. You're too quick for me. You did say a kangaroo? - Yes, yes, a kangaroo. She's waiting for me, there behind that bush. Come on, I'll show you. Hurry! (sheep bleeting) She's not here. She's gone! Where are you? Come back! Come back. Come back! - Dot. Dot, please don't be sad. Your Kangaroo must have her freedom. Must live her own life. She's going home. And her home is the bush. Kangaroo must have her freedom. Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom. (chirping) (somber music) - Kangaroo! Kangaroo, come back! Kangaroo! Come back! Oh Kangaroo! Oh Kangaroo. Kangaroo.
