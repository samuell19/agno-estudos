[♪] Why, that sick, dirty, filthy rat. Why... [GRUNTS] MOE: Oh! What's the idea of pushing my face in the paint? I didn't do it. You did. I didn't. You did. I didn't do it, so there. Ah! [GAGS] Now, get to work. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] Oh, my. [PAINT CAN CLATTERS] Moe. You see, Moe, I didn't-- Gee, I'm sorry, Moe. It was just an accident. Oh, think nothin' of it, son. Anyone can have an accident. Why, only last week I was holding a paintbrush and suddenly I got a twitch in my right arm, like this. [SPUTTERS] Oh, gee, sorry, kid. It was that old twitch again. Ha, ha. Mm, quite a twitch, quite a twitch. You know, I've got an itch to twitch too. [CACKLES] [BODY THUMPS] [LAUGHS] Cut it out, will you? Get up, you. I ought to murder you. Why, you-- Wipe that face and get busy. I'll get busy when I'm ready. Are you ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Well, go on. [CROWD APPLAUDING] There they are. Let's go and have some fun with them. [TONGUE CLICKS] [WOMEN LAUGH] Ha, ha. Hello, boys. Hello. Hiya, girls. Say, I thought you boys had parts in this show. How come you are not in your wardrobe? Ah, we only do a small bit in the Southern act in the last scene. Yeah, Doaks wouldn't give us a break. Aw, that's too bad. I'll bet you'd be great actors if only you had a chance. Thou art face to face with a great thespian lover. [LIPS KISSING] [FRENCH ACCENT] Ah, your eyes are like two limpid pools of fire that burn into my soul. Ah, fair one, come with me to the Casbahdor. Mm, this was terrific. You almost had me swooning. Step aside. You call that good? Get a load of me spouting Shakespeare. A rose by any other name would smell-- And so do you. I'll have your head for this. Your blood shall fill the streets. Draw thy sword, knave, and prepare to defend thyself. Never lived a Capulet who could insult a Montague. En garde. [EXHALES] Ah. [GRUNTS] Play on, varmint. Ah. Hiya. Ah. [GROANS] Oh. Oh. B.K., I'm terribly sorry, but the brush. I-- Shut up! I ought to fire you, but I need you. Now, listen. Nick Barker, the dramatic critic, has been panning my shows for years, and I don't want him to pan this one. So if you see him sneaking in backstage, throw him out. And watch for his assistant too. But B.K., if we throw Barker out, he'll pan our performance in tomorrow's paper. Okay, okay. Then disguise yourselves. Then he won't know who tossed him out. You can depend on us, B.K. By the way, Nick Barker has been known to disguise himself too, so if you see any suspicious characters, give 'em the works. STOOGES: Yes, sir. Ooh. Oh. Listen, boys, we've got to get disguised. There. [GRUNTS] There. Well. Ha, ha, ha, ha. [SPANISH ACCENT] Listen, Mr. Barker, don't sneak in, or Pancho's gonna shoot you, I think. I'm a bad man. I-- Ah! [GUN CLATTERS] Don't shoot. Don't shoot. [LAUGHS] My disguise is so good I didn't recognize myself. My gun. Ouch! [GASPS] Oh. Oh. I don't think Barker will recognize me in this. MOE: Now, keep your eyes open. Okay. Dangeroose Kippawa. I wonder what that is? Oh! Oh! Oh. Oh-ho-ho-ho. What happened? Somebody in that room punched me in the nose. [FEET SHUFFLING] That must be Nick Barker. He's disguised like a black banana. We'll get him. Here. Follow me. [BOXES CRASH] [BOTH GASP] Shh. Ooh! [BIRDS TWITTERING] [TWITTERING CONTINUES] Now, let's-- Hey, hey. Fine time to take a nap. Remind me to kill you later. I'll make a note of it. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Ah. [GRUNTS] Try to fool us, Mr. Barker, hey? LARRY: Oh. How do you like that, Nickie? LARRY: Oh. How do you like that? [MOE GRUNTS] It's Larry. Larry, why didn't you tell us it was you? We thought you were Nick Barker. I thought you were Nick Barker and his assistant. [DOOR CLOSES] Quiet. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] That must be Nick Barker. He's trying to sneak in. Come on. Get him. [WHISPERS] All right. Hey. Hi, Mr. Barker. [GRUNTING] Oh. It's B.K. Hurry up. Get some water. He's out. Say a few syllables. Say something. SHEMP: All right. Watch it now. I'll clear him. How is he now? [CHOKING] How is he now? Women and children first. [COUGHING] Sorry, boss. We didn't see you. That's the trouble with you morons. You didn't see Nick Barker when he sneaked in, either. Sitting in the front row watching the show. Aw, there must be some mistake. Yes, and you made it. Get the props ready for the third act, and don't forget the salad and the cake. If I had someone to replace you in that Southern act, I'd fire you. Oh, but B.K... Maybe he'll change his mind if we're good in the show. You get the cake. You get the salad. Moe, I've got news for you. You forgot to buy the cake. And the salad. You imbeciles. Why did you let me forget? BOTH: Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. [GRUMBLES] Hey, it's late. All the stores are closed. We'll have to whip up a cake and salad ourselves. Schnoz. [CARTILAGE CRUNCHES] Come on. Ah. SHEMP: Oh, oh, oh. MOE: Larry, hurry with that salad. I am. MOE: Hurry up with that flour. I'm hurrying. Well, dump it. Take it easy, Moe. Take it easy. I'll fix you up in a second. Come over here. Well, fix me up. I'll fix you up now. Don't worry about a thing. There you are, as good as new. Well, I don't know what I'd have done without you. But I do know what I'm gonna do with you. Oh. Why, you... Oh! See that? Oh! [GROWLING] Yeah, I'll murder you. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I sure fooled him, didn't I? Yeah, you... Oh, let's cut it out. [CHUCKLING] [CHUCKLING] [GRUNTS] [DISH CLATTERING] Get the rest of those layers so I can build the cake. SHEMP: Okay. Mm. [PUFFS] That potholder is no good. Hurry up and get that frosting. We've got another cake to build. And besides, we've got to get dressed for that third act. Okay. Okay. [UTENSIL CLATTERS] Ah. [BAND PLAYING "DIXIE"] GROUP: ♪ Oh, Janiebelle ♪ ♪ Janiebelle ♪ ♪ Just plain Janiebelle ♪ ♪ But we're all in love with ♪ GROUP: ♪ Janiebelle ♪ And here comes Miss Janiebelle now. JANIEBELLE: Gentlemen. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] Miss Janiebelle-- MEN: Would you all marry me? Gentlemen, I can't marry all of you. But I have it. I just baked this lovely little old cake with my own little hands, and the one who eats the most cake the quickest, I'll marry. [MEN CLAMORING] I've got to win this contest. Oh, you're losing right now, man. I'm gonna eat that cake right up. Mmm. [GRUNTS] Hey, there's something wrong with this cake. Shut up. You want to crab the show? You gotta eat it. It's part of the plot. Punch? Miss Janiebelle, what do you all call this delicious cake? Oh, I calls it Old Point Comfort. Excuse me, boys. Old Point Comfort? Tastes more like an old comforter. I get the point. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [MAN GRUNTS, COUGHS] [GRUNTING] [GAGS] [GRUNTING] [CAKE SNAPS] [GRUNTING] [SWALLOWS] [CAKE SPLASHES IN STOMACH] [CAKE TEARS] [GRUNTING] [CAKE TEARS] Is it good?

[CLEARS THROAT] [SIGHS] [COUGHS] [ALL COUGHING] [LAUGHS] They're molting. [LAUGHS] [COUGHS] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [ALL COUGHING] Boy, is that cake foul. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No. [MEN COUGHING] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Ooh! Oh. Oh. Curtain. [MEN COUGHING] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] [MEN CHOKING] Imbeciles. You've ruined me. I'm the laughingstock of all those people. [WHEEZES] You're fired. Uh-oh. Here comes Nick Barker. It's terrific. It's a sensation, B.K. This is the greatest satire I've ever seen, and these boys are hilarious. [LAUGHS] I was just telling them the same thing. Yes, sir, I'm starring my boys in the next production. [BOTH MUTTERING] A break at last. Now I can act. To be, or not to be, that is the question. Here's the answer. Oh. [COUGHING] [♪]
