[whooshing] [low ominous music] [helicopter rotor whirring] [sirens wailing] [people yelling indistinctly] [Steve] Good morning, New York. And a happy Friday to all you survivors out there, Streamin' Steve Spears on the airwaves here. And I will be broadcasting live 24/7 for the next three days as we approach the end of the world. Ooooh. [gentle music] Thank you, Cam. [Steve] Whatever you want to talk about feel free to give me a call Look, we can talk shit out, send messages to loved ones or even just request your favorite apocalyptic tracks. ♪ How are you holding up? I need a fucking drink. [Cam] Won't do you any good. [Steve] This is, of course unless Hazel calls me. Hazel, I know you're out there and I hope you're listening. Music brought us together once, and I know it will again. I love you, baby. They say we got three days left before Mother Nature turns on us for good, ending our stay on Planet Earth once and for all. This isn't the universe, stretching its arms out and rolling over in bed. This is the sheets being stripped and the mattress being changed. We're talking biblical stuff here, people. You're a good man. ♪ [Steve] We got some news to start you off today. Whether you're commuting, or evacuating, or shacked up in your apartment there are a few things you should know on this beautiful final Friday. They didn't give me a goddamn chance. When they saw I wasn't playing along with what they wanted me to, they cast me out into the streets. Wouldn't let us back in. Well, you're stubborn. And schizophrenic. But they didn't know that. [Steve] We've all heard about the hurricanes down south. The devastation caused has been absolutely surreal. Governors in five states have now declared a state of emergency and are enforcing mandatory evacuation. Doesn't matter now anyway. We stood no chance since we got here. I shouldn't go to bed cold and hungry every night. [Steve] In a similar story he overwhelming earthquake out west last week has left millions missing or displaced. Many considering this to be the big one prophesied for so many years. Residents all along the coast have been left without food, water or electricity. You can check with the U.S. Environmental Agency's website for a list of missing persons. And if you have any information, please don't hesitate to call. These streets are a goddamn death sentence. [Steve] Today marks the first day of the U.S. border closure. The president announced early last week that the US would halt aid for asylum seekers. Where flights have been able to take off and land safely airlines are doing their absolute best to get people back to their loved ones. The President officially declared that all flights will be grounded starting Saturday evening. [Cam] I found a roll of film. [homeless woman] One last project? My swan song. [Steve] Some local news, New York Board of Elections has suspended any campaign activities for the upcoming New York City mayor candidates. A.W. Curry, the restauranteur and real estate mogul has had a contentious relationship with the board since he announced his candidacy last year. When he was asked about the board's decision, he spit in the face of a reporter and yelled a racial slur at him. He's held steady support in the race. But does it even matter? New York officials have insisted that people evacuate the city. Get off the island of Manhattan, people! But, if you feel like sticking around tune into WWHH for all your apocalyptic needs.

All this talk of the end, and I figured I'd leave home. Little did I know that New York would be running low on food and supplies and all that would be left would be... coffee and prescription drugs. Regardless, I left after class a few weeks ago and never looked back. Well, I'm a college dropout too. -High school. -[Nick] Oh my God. [glass clanking] Fuck! Ah! [Katie] Death came early back home. It was a ghost town before I left, and I didn't want to sit around wallowing in self-pity. So... [Nick] Motherfucker. I need other souls to cling to. Well, sometimes solitude is the best companion. Are you saying you won't be my friend? What I'm saying is I'm wondering if you're implying that Nick has a soul. There's something in everyone worth salvaging. [Nick] Motherfucker!
