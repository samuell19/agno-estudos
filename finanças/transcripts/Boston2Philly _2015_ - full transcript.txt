- One of the real fears as we head into this evening, the winds, up to 75 miles an hour and the power now a real concern. Meteorologist Rob Marciano in Boston tonight where authorities are urging everyone to take these blizzard warnings seriously. - Any idea where he may have run off to? Girlfriend's house? Neighborhood park? We need something here. - It's getting late, George. We need to figure out what we're gonna do about all this. The press is gonna be looking for answers and I need to be informed. And I haven't slept for hours, for Christ's sake! - I don't give a damn how late it's gettin'! That's one of ours out there. And this kid is telling me you're taking him away. - Come on now, Coach. Alright, that's not fair. We didn't want this to go down the way that it did, you know that. - You could have waited till after the game. I mean, we had college scouts in the stands, for Christ's sake! The whole entire city watched you shatter this kid's dream, right on center stage. There has to be something we can do to keep him here, right? - We've tracked down his only other relative. He has a godmother in Philadelphia that we haven't reached yet. Once we do, we have no choice but to follow protocol. There's no way around it. - It's bad enough we lost the game. Now our star player vows never to pick up a basketball again. And on top of that you're telling me you're taking him away to Philadelphia! We have, we had, the best team in the whole damn state. Now you're tearing away one of our own. - I made promises to certain colleges that I need to keep. You gotta figure out how to keep him in Boston! - Enough, enough! It's time to stop thinking about what's best for us. Start thinking about what's best for the boy. - I agree with that. - The kid's a senior. On my assessment he will be a high risk of depression. Isolation and guilt may take a lot of time to get over. I don't see him picking up a ball soon. Whether or not he will fight to stay or not isn't our call, or his. It's his parents. - His parents are dead! And what the hell do you know? - I know a whole lot! And I don't have to sit here and listen to some stuck up, greedy bitch telling me what I know is certain. He ran away to be alone, that's isolation. He probably is feeling responsible for the crash, that's guilt. Do I need to speak slower for you? - Look, I know this kid. He loves it here. He won't want to leave. - Even if he did, there is nothing we can do. He has a godmother. There's documents. - What's it gonna take to make this kid stay where he belongs? We can persuade him to go to college locally. We can all get something out of this. - We could lose the file. It wouldn't be hard to convince 'em about that. - I don't believe this. You people make me sick! He's not even 18 years old yet. I'll go find him and tell him that everything is gonna be okay. That's what he needs to hear right now. - Rome! Son, come back in. - Don't touch me! And don't call me that! I'm not your son! - Look, I know you're hurting. And I understand, I really do, but it's cold. It's cold out here, come back in so we can deal with this together. - Don't touch me! There's no dealing with this! There's never any dealing with this! I lost my family! I lost my home! They're sending me away! And what are you doing about it? Nothing! It's on you, Coach! This is on you! - I've always been there for you. Look, I know you're hurting, but please. I've always been there for you and that's not gonna change. So please come back in so we can deal with this. Don't touch me! This is on you! This is on you! I'm done! I'm done! I'm done! Upstairs to the left? - Yeah. Rome, wait. When I heard the news I was, I was on a date and I was with this guy and I just broke down crying. The poor bastard. But, I was just thinking about my work and how to cook for you and laundry and what if I bring a guy home? And what if you bring a girl home? I never thought about how you were thinking, not for a second. I am not ready for this responsibility. I told her and I begged her, please give this job to somebody else. But I love your mother as a sister and I gave her my word. I'm gonna do the best that I can for you. - Are you done? Yes. - Upstairs to the left?

I don't care how awesome your jumpshot is. - I didn't even say that. - I've heard it, I've seen it all before. Can a girl just get through her day? Hey! Hey, I was talking. - I'm sorry, but this is incredible. - I guess, it's a building. - It's more than that. There are some people that can walk by something amazing, something undeniably majestic, and never appreciate the magic that's there. I've never been one of those people. If I see something that takes my breath away I'm gonna learn about it, I'm gonna stare at it. I'm gonna follow it through a train station and learn her name. - That's sweet. That's really sweet. - So why were you crying back there? - I wasn't crying. - You don't have to be that way with me. - I don't even know you. I wasn't crying, you're wrong. - Wait, hold on. Change that, get to know me. Let me get to know you. - I've had a rough day and I can't do this. - I'm not gonna say I know what you're going through. No one ever knows how deep the hurt is, unless they're the one that's going through it. - You've got a way with words. - I bet you, if you got to know me, you'd find more things you like about me. - So what do you wanna do? - Let me steal you away. We'll do whatever we want. Can I do that? - Yeah. Yeah, you can do that. Oh, my God, it's like right there! Why did I not see that? It's amazing how things work out. - What do you mean? - I've lived here my entire life and I never really remembered what it was like to see everything for the first time. We're looking at swans. I don't know, you're bringing me back. - Philadelphia definitely has something going on. Why were you crying? - I wasn't crying. - Don't, just... You can trust me. - I don't trust anyone. I have someone in my life. - Of course, you do. - I'm sorry. - The good ones always have someone in their lives. Problem is, it's never the right one. - Thank you for this. It helped, but I should go. - Hey, hey! Hey! I guess I'll see you around? - If you're lucky you won't. - Can I get your name? - Philly. And yours? - Boston. - Okay. - Yo, you ready for this? I don't know, man. I'm not really feeling it. You're not feeling what? - This, man. I'm not feeling it. - Don't do this right now. I mean, we already went over this. Don't tell me you're bitchin' out! - Yo, you gotta stop playing thug, man. That's not us! Never has been, never will. We gotta find another way to make this money up. - G, well, you tell me and we could do it! I mean, this is our reality! You don't want me to go to that white-ass school! We need white people money! You really think they gonna give a brother a loan? - You don't think I know that? I know that! I also know we made it this far to get put in a box! Look, I'm not bailing out. I just want you to know the consequences in case this shit heads south. If this shit heads south that's it for us! We done! - Jay's too drunk to chase his dream. I mean, we was about that trapped life. To me it seems like everybody had to get they hands dirty to get what they want. You ready? Don't say a word. Don't say a fucking word. We ain't here to hurt you. We gonna leave and you will say nothing! You got me? You got me? Good shit, man. Stop! Alright, let's go, we good. No, we ain't good yet! What? You think 'cause you've got money you're better than us? You're the worst white woman in the world! No real work. Simply out here doing what we gotta! But you don't see it like that. You think we animals! You think we don't know no better. Come on, that's it, I'm done! I'm done robbing these houses. We shouldn't even be here in the first place. I can't believe you got me into this mess! I got you into this? Yeah, you did. You losing your head. You weak! How you gonna pay for college, G? How you gonna pay for your books? You need this! I'm done with it. We can't be runnin' into these houses and being activists, that's stupid! This ain't us! I'll find my way. After this shit I'm done! Did you forget you're going to go to that white-ass school and leave me? You fake-ass nigga! - Take off the hat. My name is-- - I know what your name is, Wilkerson, Gideon. What I don't know is how you ended up sitting in front of me. You were one step away from being enrolled in one of the best universities this state can offer. But as of a few months ago you were also one step away from spending some time in jail. - I'd rather focus on the present, not the past, if you don't mind. - Excellent grades throughout your high school career, but your rap sheet is just as impressive. How could you think you could even go here, let alone ask the college to pay the money for it? - How could I think I could go here? How could I not? - Excuse me? - About 45 % of black children graduate high school. One in three black males can expect to go to jail in their life. Probably spend their 18th birthday in jail. - I understand-- - A young black male is more likely to die by gunfire than any soldier has done in Vietnam. - You know your stuff. - I spent my 18th birthday a free man applying to this university. So if I could survive all that and more I can at least think I can make it anywhere. I just need the financial aid. - You are something. So tell me, should I overlook the drug possession with intent to distribute? The fights? The board wear ring you may or may not be involved in? I want to help you but help me to understand this. I mean, what were you even thinking getting involved in this stuff? - There's a term, affluenza. Excuse me? - This shit is crazy. It's called affluenza. That anybody does not understand the consequences of one's actions based on financial privilege. - What? Man, I don't believe that. - Believe it, it's real. See, there was this rich kid that hit a bunch of folks in his whip and he got off because he had money. - What do you mean? What are you saying? - Think about it. All we know, people selling, people robbing. Shit, we got family members in they 30's still in that trapped life. We risk whatever 'cause if we don't life ain't shit. We not worrying about the consequences 'cause we too broke. - And what are your thoughts now on this reversed affluenza? - I think he was wrong. We knew exactly what we were doing. We just didn't care. - You are remarkable. - Thank you. - Sit down. Look at all the fresh meat. You're laughing now, you might not be laughing when I'm done. My name is Gerard Balan. You don't know me and, honestly, I prefer it that way. This is my first year as a professor and I plan on taking a more unconventional route to teaching the bright young minds of this generation. I won't bore you with my rap sheet or my resume, but here's what you do need to know. I have a net worth of six million dollars. And I also have permission from the dean herself to conduct this course as I see fit. Okay? I'm not here to be your father. I'm not here to teach you some useless stuff you'll either never remember or forget. I'm not here to hold your hand. I'm here to prepare you for life. I want you to develop a deeper understanding of your inner self. I want you to understand your connection to others, to everything around you, to the people around you. And in doing this, maybe you'll discover your passion. I want you to step outside of the bubble you've lived in your whole life. So here's what we're going to do. I'm gonna split you up into groups of four. Okay, you can choose, I don't care. You're going to meet with each other. You're going to ask each other questions. You're going to get answers. You're gonna dig deep. Okay, you're gonna explore. You're gonna share ideas. You're gonna share emotions. You're gonna get to know each other, get inside each other's head. And at the end of the course I'm gonna sit down with you, one on one, and we are going to go over your 50 minimum page paper. No, don't groan. By learning about each other you'll learn about yourself. I'm going to analyze them, I'm going to ask you some questions. I'm gonna score them and the highest paper will receive a check for $50,000. Does that make it real enough for you? $50,000, okay? Yeah, but here's a warning, okay, here's a warning. If you take this lightly you'll fail. If you use Wiki searches and Google, you'll fail. I want you to rely on your group as a crutch. Okay? I want you to reach to them and to discover and explore ideas and emotions you never could on your own, because I want you to remember something and this is important. A dream that you dream alone is just a dream. But a dream that you dream together, that's reality. Welcome to college. - Boston. - Philly. What are you doing here? - I go here. - Were you in that class? Yes. - I didn't see you. - I was late. I saw you. - Okay, so you're following me now? Your boyfriend okay with that? - Look, you don't know what you're talking about, so let's just leave it at that. I just thought, we need one more. - You thought you'd come over here, bat your eyes, throw out a smile and I'd do what you want? - Pretty much. - You need one, I need three. I guess I have no choice. - See? - What about me and you? - I mean, we met on a random day, now we're in the same class with the same crazy ass professor. Sometimes you just gotta admit things happen for no reason at all. - Easier said than done, I guess. What about him? Boyfriend? - That's G. - G? - G. - Who's our fourth? - So, how do you know him? - Long story. - Come on, drunken hookup, baby daddy? I know there's something sexual going on here. You're so out of pocket. - Out of pocket. - Whatever. - So what do you think, G? $50,000 dollars is a lot of money. - Not split four ways. - Who said anything about splitting it four ways? - I know I didn't. So how do you know her? - Who, Philly? - Yeah. - Long story. What part of Philly you from? - Long story. Grab your stuff. - Oh, yes, okay. - Hey, guys. What's going on? - Okay. Okay, listen, we don't have the luxury of figuring out of this is a good fit or not, so we're just gonna have to make it compatible, okay? Alright? Right. - Okay, professor said that we're gonna have to help each other if we wanna pass this assignment. Alright? So we're just gonna have to be honest with one another, so maybe we can figure out what's going on in here and in here. Wow. - I know, alright. - Okay. - So, it's simple. You pick a question and you answer it. You don't get to lie. You just answer it and you keep it moving. Alright? - What if we don't feel like answering the questions? - You answer 'em anyways. - Too street to answer questions, G? - Okay, wait a minute, so let me get this straight. You expect us to just answer any old question you put out there? Put our business out there for some cash we don't even know is real? - You know, out of everyone at this table, I'd expect that from you. - And what the hell's that supposed to mean? - Okay, what's going on here? - Ask Philly. - You know what? Yeah, I like this game, so I'll go first. Why'd you come to Philadelphia, Boston? - I don't know. I have one for you. When's the last time you cheated on your boyfriend, Philly? - Ooh. - Okay. - Wait, I can't do this, guys. I am gonna be the sole reason why you lose this thing. I'm sorry. - Hey, man! You think you're special? You're not! We all have issues. This is why we're here, to figure it out. Together. - Together. - Okay, everyone just have a seat, okay? Here, pick your question. - I'm first? - Yep. - If you could choose the sex and physical appearance of your soon-to-be child, would you do it? I answer, too? That's the point, you answer 'em and you keep it moving. - I would not. But I'd be hoping for a guy. - Of course. - What do you constitute for a perfect day? - Aww. - I would say just hangin' around people that actually care about me. Okay? - Very nice. - Okay, so, if you could have anyone as your guest who would you want as a dinner guest? Oh my, God. Well, I don't know. I guess I need a lot of laughter, I think, these days, so I'm gonna say Kevin Hart. - Okay. A dude from Philly? - Exactly. - Alright, what is the worst memory that you have? So, I, I am a cutter. - What? - Um, I don't like to tell people, but it's something that I struggle with and... I started doing it in high school and it gets worse sometimes and then other times I'm okay. - Why? Why do you cut? - They say it's to help me physically feel things that emotionally hurt me. It's a way for me to feel the pain and let it be released. And I don't expect anybody to understand it and I can't even explain it that well. But it's something that people struggle with and that I struggle with. So, that's how you're honest and that's how you answer the questions and you keep it moving. Alright, your turn. - Okay, Rye Rye. What would you do with the $50,000 dollars if you won? There is no money, I don't care what you guys say. This guy's not givin' the loot. - Can't you be positive? - Alright, I'd buy two cars, one for me, one for G. - Yes, sir. Well, we'll just stay walking, I guess. I mean, we see you guys. You got gas money? - It's not cheap, it's not cheap in Philly. - Listen, we came from the bottom. This is all we know. Look around. You know we can't pull stuff in our neighborhood like this. The boys in our hood? They are tryin' to rob us and kill us. Yo, why you think I got to SUNY? Sometimes you gotta fit in just to make it out. I got this so they don't spot me, yo. You feelin' me? - I feel you. - What's goin' on, Philly? How you been? - You'd know if you came to our meetings. - I have things on my mind, other classes. - So, these classes offer 50K? - Philly, please, professors don't give money. They give homework, they give headaches. - You give headaches. That's good. What are you studying? - You ain't in the class. - I'm a pretty smart guy, I could help you out. What we got here? - I think somebody thinks he's slick. - You got me. - Funny, I think I can count how times I've seen you smile. - Some people just don't smile. - I don't believe that. I think something's keeping you from smiling. - Yeah, maybe. - Well, trust me, you're not gonna win the fight alone. And I gotta go. - I just got here. - I've been here. Excuse you. Bye. - I've been to too many of these things. It never seems to get easier. They never seem to end fast enough. - Sorry it couldn't end fast enough for you. - You know what I mean. - Yeah. - Look, I brought you the game ball, thought you might want it. - Yo, put that in the trash, man. - You know, they told me that you got nasty now. Said you were a 'ticking time bomb'. I don't believe 'em. I still don't. - What do you want, Coach? - I just came by to help out. Help out any way I could. - By bringing me a ball? - Listen Rome, I don't have any children. I got the team and I got a ball. I coach because that's all I ever wanted to do. - Save me the speech, Coach. I just wanna be alone. - Listen, you don't have to be like this. It's okay to just be a kid, to let it go. It's okay to cry. - You done? - Yeah, I'm done. Just keep it. Philly! - What? - Philly, hold on. - Why are you always running behind me? You need to find yourself a girl. - I got myself a girl. She's just stubborn. - Is that so? - Let me take you out. - No, that is not a good idea. - It's a great idea. Get something to eat, go to the movies. Sneak in some liquor. We just have fun. - Listen, I told you, I'm spoken for. - I'm not trying to make you do something you don't wanna do. I just want to get to know you more. I wanna know the chick that I met on the train. The one that forces me to laugh when I don't even want to smile. The one that I kissed. - Look, I'm not saying that I don't think about the first time we met. I mean, you came outta nowhere and it was great, but I have someone and he knows me. He's known me for a really long time. Me and you, we had the perfect day. Why can't we just leave it at that? - We can't and we shouldn't. - You're so hard-headed. Are all the guys from Boston like you? - Let me steal you away. And I promise, Philly, I won't even kiss you afterwards. - I just don't think it's a good idea. I mean, so what, we go out, we have a horrible time. I don't laugh at any of your corny jokes. You get tired of me playing the tough girl. And then what? It's ruined, we have nothing. - My mom always taught me not to think twice. Close your eyes and jump. - Alright, we go, but as friends. - It's a date. - Not a date! It's a date! - Not a date!

I usually don't bring a lot of people up here. Actually... I never brought anyone up here. It's like a home away from home, you know? - No, I don't know. We've been hanging out all semester. Not once have you mentioned home. - We have two different definitions of homes. You guys got your big houses, white picket fence. I don't have any of that. My brother is my home. We travel to different parts of Philly, learning new things, experiencing new things. Seeing what Philly really has to offer. You guys wouldn't know anything about that. - I feel like you guys don't know anything about me. I don't have a white picket fence. I don't even know what that is. The only one that knows me is a stranger now. - I know you. And I'm right here. And every time I try to get to know you better you run away. Then you become a stranger. - Hey, okay, stop. I know what you're all saying about the white picket fence. But I had that. I had all that and it didn't protect me from hurt, or harm. You know, and I told you guys the only thing that got me out of a hard place was a friendship. And here we are, we've known each other all semester, but we still don't really know each other. And we're trying to win that $50,000 dollars, but how are we gonna get it like this? You know, and even if that money isn't real, don't you want something to believe in? Or something to connect us? - I'm tired of being sad. - I'm tired of being angry. - I never brought anyone up here. I guess this is our home. - Yeah, this can be our home. - Oh, I think I'm gonna call you Lucy Liu. Oh, that's racist. I think I'm gonna call you Rye Rye.

I was trying to figure out if maybe I didn't say the right thing to you or I didn't show you enough. I couldn't figure out why you were ignoring me for all those weeks. And then tonight, you treated me like I didn't matter. I had the feeling that maybe you weren't thinking about me the same as I was thinking about you. - I wasn't trying to ignore you, or be mean, it's just... I think about you all the time. And I hate it. You do everything right and I hate you for it. - You said some things are just coincidence. You still think that, even now? - You know what? Tonight I just don't even wanna think.

So if this is not the right time, I understand. - I'm sure. - Come on, man, get out the car, I love you. Let me get a hug or something. - Alright. I'll come out. No! Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Listen, I'd just like to make the statement that I'm both honored and humbled to serve our great city as its 58th mayor. - Mr. Mayor, according to-- - And I look forward to - Reliable sources. - Putting my plan into action that my staff has started to improve the education systems of the city of Philadelphia. Thank you very much. - Mr. Mayor, according to a reliable resource, the students are being kept from speaking up about the conditions in the school. - That's simply just not true. - Mr. Mayor, there are many people who believe you haven't taken a strong enough stance against the obvious growth of gentrification in popular black communities in Philadelphia. Would you like to comment? - You know what? Let's grant him the opportunity to an official press conference before we further question. - Mr. Mayor, what about the school closings? - We've closed some certain underperforming schools, but we're gonna reopen new schools that are gonna be better for our students. - You mean the black schools? You're on record stating that the Black Lives Matter movement is volatile and nothing more than a social media fad. - We'll make an official statement when our staff has looked at the issues and we're ready to talk about it, thank you. Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor! - No more questions, back up! - Bullshit! - I'm so sorry, Mr. Mayor. - You heard him! - What did you say? - He said bullshit! - Philadelphia has one of the lowest educational funding in the United States! You sound like you're doing a good job, the whole time people are here looking dumb as hell! - Now, hold on there. - I guess that Philly, is even investing in our children's educational future? Or making sure the rich dicks stay rich? Our kids get screwed over! - Do you have any comment, Mr. Mayor? - Ya'll tax and spend corporations, meanwhile you cut over a billion dollars for education statewide! - I know 10 schools that closed down! Teachers fired! We don't have no school counselors, nurses! Shit, we don't even got paper! - I think you guys just need to chill out, alright? - Don't do that! Don't patronize me! Or say some relatable bullshit like chill out. - You can never be relatable! Because your shoes too clean - Push him back. - And your hair's too clean! - Push him back. - No, no, no, I don't need no applause! This doesn't deserve no applause! I just call bullshit when I see it! And we tired of it! - Do you have any comment, Mr. Mayor? Would you like to comment, Mr. Mayor? Don't say a word! Alright, let's go, we're good! No, we ain't good yet! What? I got you into this? How you gonna pay for college, G? How you gonna pay for your books? After this shit, I'm done! Did you forget you wanna go to that white-ass school and leave me? You fake-ass nigga! - Move! Get out the way! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Get out the way! Come on!

We got some things to do when I get my-- - He say in eight months to a year he gonna be finished-- I'm just, I'm just, when you runnin' down the highway. When you runnin' down the highway you gonna run into traffic. - Does anyone know where I can find Carolina? What? - Who's asking? - I'm a, I'm Rome. She calls me Boston you've probably heard. - Boston? - No, she ain't never mentioned no Boston, homie. I don't know about that. - Are you guys her family, like, are you her dad or something? - Carolina, she ain't got no family. She adopted. She ain't mention that to you? Look at his face. - No, she didn't mention that. Is she here? Whoa. - See us Philly guys, right? We got a natural chip on our shoulder. We don't like nobody from nowhere else. You follow what I'm saying? We come from the mud. See, we was factory workers, grinding metal and stuff. And when they all shut down we had it rough. So we had to get rough. You know what I'm saying? See, you from Boston man. What, you was born with a silver spoon. Y'all got molasses and chowder and stuff like that. You ain't no Philly boy, aki. See, we might got the same color skin, but we different on the inside. We wolves, man. You ain't gonna find no brotherly love up in here. You hear me? And Carolina, she's spoken for. She property of. Etched on her biker jacket. Forget about her, you hear me? Boston! - Philly, who are these people? What are you doing here? You've gotta go. I came looking for you. - Nah, he ain't going nowhere. And Philly you asking for a death wish bringing this Boston boy to the heart of north Philly. What's wrong with you? - Stop it! He's leaving, okay? - Yo, he ain't like us. Look at him. He ain't got that fire in his eyes. Shit, look how he dress. - Please go, I'll explain later. Just go. You never told me you were adopted. - Just leave, he's leaving. - No, he ain't going nowhere yet. We ain't even introduced each other yet. See, I'm Big Papa. My brother upstairs, that's her fiance. - Yeah. You're married? - Oh, you ain't tell him? Tell him. Tell college boy. Tell him how you left my brother paralyzed! And you ran out on him! How he proposed to you and loved you and you left him after eight years! Now he a damn retard! - Philly! - Big P, please! - You need to make a decision, man! Hey yo, man, take Boston out the back. - Oh, Mr. Boston, don't go showing your face around here no more. If you do, we're running you for all your baked beans and your Boston Tea Party! Get the hell outta here, homie! - Boston, wait! Please, wait! - What, Philly? - Listen to me! - We're done! - Don't say that! - We are done! - That's not fair! You don't understand! He almost died right in front of me! How do you want me to walk away? - Almost died? - I can't just abandon him! - Almost died? My parents did die! To come watch me play some bullshit game! Life's not fair! Shit happens! - Why wouldn't you tell me that? - Tell you what? That I shouldn't be here? That I should be home? Did you tell me about him? Exactly! - We can talk about it now! - No! - Stay here. Welcome to your new living arrangement. - Are you serious? - This isn't a joke, Rome! This is your life! If they press charges then you're kicked out of college! - I'm sorry. - This isn't about being sorry, Rome! This is about helping me help you. Speak to me! Just talk to me, Rome. - What do you want me to say? I told them everything. I told them my secrets, my dreams. I told them everything, alright? You lost a friend. I lost my mom and my dad! I can't get over that! I can never get over that! - It's nothing to get over. It's life. There's no blueprint. I mean, we wake up, we live. We go to sleep and somewhere, somehow, amazing things happen. Hopefully, we fall in love and then everything changes. But you can't describe it. And you can't talk about it and you just feel it. I loved your mom. And I love you. You don't have to get over it, no one's telling you to. You can cry. You don't have to be tough. You don't have to run. You don't... You can be a kid. - You don't have to be like this. It's okay to just be a kid, to let it go. It's okay to cry. - You done? - Yeah, I'm done. - Yo, I draw. I mean, we only went in that house for money. That's all we went in there for. I didn't know the girl was gonna be in there. I mean, I didn't even know she was gonna wake up. And when she did, I just got so angry. She represented everything that we wanted. Parents down the hallway, a big house, money. Innocence. You know, that's a luxury where we come from. I mean, I know I messed up. - Yeah, it's okay. I know. Life tends to bring the worst out in people. And that shame and regret you're feeling? That just shows you care. Man, I know you my whole life. I know you like the back of my hand. I'm telling you it's okay. Thanks. Guess I was all that. - This whole college life is new to me. Especially that $50,000. - 50K? Yeah, man. - That's some bread. You think it's real? - Gotta be real, you in college now. - Yeah, that's true. Besides the 50K, I met a few people along the way. Like this cool bull named Boston. I could tell life shook him up a little bit, just like us. True. - Yeah. I mean, think about it, he lost his parents, in a whole nother city, don't really know anybody, but deep down I know he's still a good dude. Then there's this nice bad one, Asian. Bad one? Yeah. The only thing is she's a cutter. Damn. - Yeah, she cuts herself. But she's just, she has a good spirit. She holds it together as much as she can. And this girl named Philly. Boston calls her Philly. I think there's something going on between them, but that's none of my business. You could tell she's going through things. Even now. All of them are good people, but just meeting all them gives me hope. It tells me that people are still going through things just like us. We're not alone in this. Yeah. - They're fighting just like us. And if there's hope for them, damn sure gonna be hope for us. - That's true. Yeah. I have one question, though. What's that? - You smashin' any of 'em? I'm dead serious. Like for real. - You need to worrying about that interview with Miss Brooks tomorrow. True. Not asking me if I smashed anything. - I just um... I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what to do. I feel really confused and give me some type of sign. Show me something, tell me something. I'm not trying to be selfish. I can't live this way anymore. I feel like I'm just watching my life go by and I spend every moment worrying about you. I'm not happy. I just... Yeah, I just need your help.

Is he home or? - No, he actually left 30 minutes ago. He left with his basketball. - Makes sense. Alright, thank you. - I knew he'd like Philly. - Push, push, push, touch! Back, come on, come on, push, come on, push. To the line, come on. You gotta be tough! You gotta be strong! You gotta want this like you wanna breathe! - I do want this, Coach! - What are you doing here, Philly? - Well, there's only three courts around your house, so this was my second guess. - How'd you know where I live? - I did a little snooping. - Does your boy Big P know you're here? - Rome, please. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything that's happened to you, everything that's happen to me. I am. - You know when I first saw you I couldn't take my eyes off you. You came into my life fast. I should have been thinking about my mom, my dad. I should have been mourning. I know that. Instead I was thinking of you. I can't make you choose between us. Between me and him. I can't do that to you. - I love him. But I'm in love with you. - Let's play one on one. - Are you crazy? - I'm a basketball star, play your heart. - It's raining, my hair. - Friendships and family are hard to tell apart. That connection, that longing, that feeling we have for another person. It's not blood that binds us. It's simply the ability to trust someone. To trust someone other than yourself. That's what bonds you to someone. The connections you make at this point in your life are so important to the person you'll become, to the type of adult you'll become, perhaps the type of parent you'll become to your child. And how do we do that? We connect by being vulnerable. By opening up and sharing our past. And we all have a past. Some of them are scarier than others. Some of us have faced death head on. Some of us have lost loved ones. Some of us have fallen in love, only to have our heart broken. The list goes on. But there's one thing that we all, we all have in common. We're all standing here. We are all standing here today and we will continue to stand. To continue to pursue what we feel we need to gain happiness. I presented you, at the beginning of this course, with the challenge of getting to know your inner self. Something we truly cannot do as children, still blind to the horrors in the world. I asked you to do this by getting to know your group. By asking questions of them, about them. Getting to know them and seeing yourself in their eyes, through their eyes. So you would take this seriously I offered you the one thing, the one incentive, that I knew you could all comprehend. And that is? Money. - Money, that's right. The decision as to who won was very, very difficult. All of your papers were wonderful and a million other adjectives that really don't need expression. So I say this. You're all winners. And there is no money. What? - The real reward from what you've learned is in understanding and appreciating one of life's greatest mysteries. Although we are all born into this world alone, we are also born in it together. And that person sitting next to you is more important and always will be more important than any amount of money. ♪ Something in your eyes ♪ A melody so strong it's like ♪ Every new love song has found me ♪ ♪ The chorus in your smile ♪ It's like a piece of heaven now ♪ ♪ It releases every doubt I was feeling ♪ ♪ I'm better 'cause I know you ♪ Wherever we should roam to ♪ I want you to know ♪ You're always gonna hold ♪ This permanent place in my heart ♪ ♪ 'Cause you must be the one ♪ The one who changes it all ♪ Came in, I'm no longer afraid to fall ♪ ♪ I'll lay it all ♪ Right here on the line for you ♪ ♪ 'Cause you must be the one ♪ The one, the one, the one ♪ You must be the one ♪ You must be the one ♪ The one, the one, the one ♪ You must be the one - Ready to play, coach? - You know I'm not gonna take it easy on you?
