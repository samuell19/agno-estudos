Put those old Christmas classics back up on the shelves. We've got new tales of giving and loving, -and elves. -(ALL LAUGHING) In our first yuletide story, two stars are on ice. They've been best friends forever, so cordial and nice. But can both share the stage with the lights shining bright? Or will egos get bruised in a double-Iutz fight? - What beautiful skaters. -(CROWD CHEERING) Oh, Minnie, you're not nervous, are you? A little. Does it Show? Aw, no. You're going to be great.

At this grand, stately mansion, three kids decked the halls. (KIDS LAUGHING) Sliding down bannisters, climbing the walls. But soon they may wish they'd shown more self-control, or they'll wake up on Christmas to find lumps of coal. DONALD: (SINGING) We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year (CHILDREN SCREAMING PLAYFULLY) Watch out below! DEWEY: Whoa!

(ALL BELCH) Donald, say something. (BELCHES) Attention, everyone. Time for dessert. (CLAPS) (WHIRRING) (GASPS) (ALL GASP) (CLANG) I just love that. Cookies! Oh! Get off the table! Where are your manners? DONALD: Oh. -(TYMPANI ROLL) -(CRACKS) My cookies! What happened to my scrumptious silver dollar chocolate chip cookies? (BELL DINGS) Boys! How could you? Hey, aren't we innocent until proven guilty? - No! -(ALL GASP) You three march right upstairs! Now! I'm sure the cookies were delicious, Uncle Scrooge. They were. Just let me at 'em! - Whoa! - Donald! Don't make a big deal out of nothing. Let me go! Listen, I'll go talk to them. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Come in. Boys, I want to tell you something important. That you made us more cookies? No, that might send the wrong message. Listen, I don't want you three to make the same selfish choices that I made when I was your age. But you turned out rich. Rich because I was selfish. ALL: We want to be rich and selfish, too. Thun'snmbuwl mummy There's owning a mansion with its own zip code. And having a different private jet for every day of the week. And an Olympic-size swimming pool with your own submarine. Yes, the submarine is a highlight. (LAUGHS) But you're missing the point. The one thing that I wanted more than anything else I never got, because I never got on Santa's good list. Well, why didn't you just buy it? You cannot buy being on Santa's list. Now, hear me out, lads, because I'm losing my patience. It's simple. If you don't clean up your act, you don't get on Santa's list. If you're not on the list, you don't get presents. -(BOTH GASP) - What? A little food for thought. Night, night, boys. Pleasant dreams. (HUMMING) Easy for you to say. We made the good list, right? Absolutely. We've been very good this year. I got it, I got it! (CRASH) Hey, Uncle Donald, we washed your car. (QUACKS) (HUMMING) -(FLUSHES) - Whoa! (SLURPS) (POPS) (QUACKING) Uncle Donald, come quick! (GASPS) (ALL LAUGH) (ALL LAUGH) ALL: We're doomed. Oh! There's no way we're on Santa's good list this year. I guess it's too late to change. Yeah. It's Christmas Eve. (CLOCK TICKING) So, you want to put some frogs in Uncle Donald's bed? Maybe later, but first I got a great idea. We'll write our own names on Santa's list. But Santa lives way up at the North Pole. Yeah. How are we going to get there, migrate? Okay, feather head, what do you think is easier? Cleaning up our act by tomorrow or going to the North Pole? No contest. North Pole, here we come. Ready? Let's roll. ALL: Ow! Ow! (MUSIC PLAYING) -(BRAKES HISS) -(DOOR CLOSES) (ALL GROANING) We made it. Whoa. Next time we mail ourselves first class. Whoa! It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. (MUSIC PLAYING) (CLICKING) (THUDDING) (HONKS) (GULPS) (WHIRRING) (HONKING) Look at all these elves. We're never going to get away with this. We need a disguise. Let's move! (ELF GRUNTING) Oh, yeah, this'll fool 'em. Hey, fellow elf, can you give me a hand here? Yeah, right. Be right with you. Well, Dewey? How are we going to find the list in this place? I'm working on it. I can't see anything with this map in the way. (BOTH GASP) - A map? - A map? Good work, Louie. - Look, it says "Santa's list" right here. - Let's move. (ALL PANTING) (ALL GASP) (GRUNTING) It's locked. Whoa! Find Santa, and we find the key. Back to the map.

With just a hint of mocha. - Quiet! - Quiet! (YAWNS) Oh! Oh, that's the spot. (YAWNS) I got it. Uh... Whoa! Hot, hot, hot! Whoa! Ah! (SLAMS) (SNORING) Whew! Nothing can wake that guy. -(COUGHING) -(RINGING) Huh? What? Except that. (RINGING) It's for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hello? - WOMAN: Santa! Now, don't you go back to napping. I know when you've been sleeping. I know when you're awake. Oh, is it that time already? (SNIFFS) Hey, what are they cooking in the kitchen? Mmm. Smells like roast duck. Now, don't dillydally, you hear? You better kick it up a notch. Yes, yes, of course. I'll be right down. (PUNKS) Ho. (WHIRRING) -(SLAMS) - Huh? (GROANING) Give me that. Good list, here we come.

It took forever to stack these Jailbreak Bob toys. Jailbreak Bob? JAILBREAK BOB: Let me out, see? I was framed, see? Uh-Oh. I didn't do it, see? No worries. Accidents happen. We got to get all these keys back into the jails. These dolls still have to be wrapped. But he lost the key to the men's room. No problem. Whichever key doesn't fit is yours. Let's move. - I'll start over here. - What a mess. I'll help. JAILBREAK BOB: Let me out. Let me out, see? My brother did it, see? - I'm bustin' out of here. - I'll pull your string. (JAILBREAK 8088 ALL TALKING) Let me out! Let me out! Hey, I got a defective key over here. What'll I do with it? I don't know. Throw it at Morty. No, wait! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (GASPS) Come on! Follow that key! Hey, aren't you guys going to help restack these? Uh, sure. Be right with you. They aren't coming back, are they? (STAMPING) (WHIRRING) - Here you go. - Got it. - Here's another. - All right. Oh, this one's empty. There you are. JAILBREAK BOB: Quit eyeballin'me, see? That hurt, see? It's got to be here somewhere. Oh, where is it? Hey, I got it! I got it! Oh, no! Look what they've done! (ALL GASP) ALL: Oh! Ugh! Uh... Uh... Give me that, you. Let's get out of here. (ALARM BUZZING) WOMAN ON PA: Emergency! Emergency! We are at Elf Con One. Don't panic! Thank you. To the list! We're running out of time! (GROANING) Hey, what's the big... Oh, goodness me. I'm terribly sorry. Sometimes it's hard to see past the old tum tum. Hey, you found my key! Uh... Thanks, boys. I've been looking for this. Got to check that list one more time, you know. (ALL GASP) ELF: Santa, come quick! It's a disaster. We're way off schedule. Christmas is ruined! (SOBBING) SANTA: Ho, ho, ho! How bad could it be? Remember the sleigh crash of '64? That bad? Worse! Look! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, now, that's bad. I'd better get down there. Christmas is ruined! (SOBBING) What have we done? (POPPING) DEWEY: We really made a mess of things. We ruined Christmas for every kid in the whole entire world. Uncle Scrooge was right. We'll never clean up our act. (SIGHS) Hey, but we can clean up our mess! What do you say, fellows? (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (BONES) (CREAKS) (CLICKS) (WHIRRING) (CLICKING) (STAMPING) -(WHISTLES) -(GULPS) (STAMPING) (TEMPO OF MUSIC INCREASING) -(MACHINE WHEEZES) - Huh? Uh, excuse me. I'm out of...

There's a celebration in progress in all departments. All elves are to party down, and, Santa, you shake that bowl full of jelly! Hmm? Sorry. Got carried away. It's been fun, fellas. See you. Bye. Take care of yourselves. We ruined Christmas and then saved it, all in one day. How many kids can say that? Yeah, but I guess there's no presents for us this year. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) We were this close to getting on the good list. Close, but we still failed. -(KEYS JINGLE) -(DOOR UNLOCKS) (WHISTLING) Or did we? -(GASPS) -(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Whoa! Santa's list! And he checks this twice? Hey, you're not supposed to be in here! You know the rules. There's an emergency in sporting goods! Someone tossed their Christmas cookies! Oh, dear! Step aside! Duty calls! All right, now, what do we got here? Look, a list for every city. Oh, you're right. New York, London, Paris, Beijing, and Duckburg! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Yep. We were right. Our names are nowhere on this thing. Not for long. Pencil, Huey. This is it, boys. Everything we've worked for. We'll show Uncle Scrooge. What are you waiting for? Hmm. Good thinking. That'll show him. This is going to be the best Christmas ever. - All right! - Yeah! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (ENGINES ROAR) (BRAKES SCREECHING) Hey, the box said "fragile!" You think it worked? I sure hope so. Look! There it is! Whoa! That Santa's scary fast. I can hardly wait. DAISY: Good morning. Merry Christmas, everyone. Step aside! Coming through! Donald! Where are your manners? Good morning, boys. Up and dressed already? Oh, would you look at that? Is that for you, Iaddies? Actually, it's for you, Uncle Scrooge. (GASPS) For me? It's from Santa. Really? Should I open it? - Yeah! - Yeah! (TEARING) Oh... (GASPS) It's what I've wanted since I was a wee lad in the Highlands. You wanted bagpipes? I guess you finally made it onto Santa's good list. Mission accomplished. Boys! There are more presents back here! ALL: There are? - Aw, cool! - Whoa! Hey, look! I got a train! Look at my glider! Hey, look! I got a Jailbreak Bob! JAILBREAK BOB: Be good this year, see? And have a merry Christmas. Where? Is, uh, this what you're looking for? That's it! Oh, boy! What'd you get? "The Big Book of Manners"? (LAUGHS) Ha.Ha.Ha. Very funny. I don't get it. Why do you suppose Santa gave us presents, too? Hey, fellas, look. It's from Santa. "Dear boys, "there's always room on my list "for those who think of others first. "Keep up the good work. "Oh, and thanks for the help in the toy shop. "Love, Santa. "P.S. You might need these." Marshmallows! (PLAYING OUT OF TUNE) Those aren't marshmallows. (ALL GROANING) Boy, that's bad on the ear. Oh, Donald. (CONTINUES PLAYING) NARRATOR: They started out selfish, those rascally brothers, but made Christmas magic by thinking of others. Goofy always means well, spreading holiday cheer, but embarrasses Max with his pratfalls each year. Oh, he tries to step up to the plate and be cool, but now Max has grown up, will Dad still play the fool? (CRASHES) (MUSIC PLAYING) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) Max, I'm really looking forward to meeting your dad. - Yeah, about my dad... - Thank you. I just want to warn you. He's a little, well, different. Oh, Max, I'm sure he's great. Don't get me wrong. He's really funny. He makes people laugh. Usually at him. But he can be a bit clumsy. Accident-prone, disaster waiting to happen. I'd better give him a call. GOOFY: (SINGING) I was strollin' through the park one day In the merry, merry month of May I was taken by surprise... (CELL PHONE CHIMING) Surprise? Hyuck! That must be Maxie. {POPS) -(DINGS) Hello? Hey, Dad, it's me. Maxie! Max, Dad. Look, I need to talk to you. Hyuck! How's the weather up there? It's cold. Dad, this is important.

Uh-huh. And I want to make a good impression. I was kind of wondering if you could kind of play it, um... You know, cool? Oh, gotcha. Don't worry, son. We'll give her a Christmas she'll never forget! Whoa! Whoa! (CRASHING) Yep. That's what I'm afraid of. (HORN BLOWS) (MUSIC PLAYING) I've got a boatload of butterflies in my belly I'm short of breath with legs of jelly Feel like I'm floatin' 'Bout 5 feet off the ground So I've got to ask for just one big favor That my dad be on his best behavior When he sees the two of us around I'm gonna try to face the holidays fearlessly And I hope he'll do his best not to embarrass me Make me look good Make me shine If you make me look good I just might get to make her mine Make me look good (LAUGHING) You have the tendency to frustrate me Seems that you humiliate me MONA: Aw. Every single time you get the chance Mmm... Is it any wonder that I'm so frantic? What with all your crazy antics Ruining all my chances for romance MONA: How cute. I don't expect you to become Sir Henry Dignified But could you just try to prove that you were on my side Make me look good Make me shine If you make me look good I just might get to make her mine Make me look good (MONA LAUGHING) (GROANS) (SIGHS) GOOFY: Oh, that Mona.

Dad, please! I'm just going to take a walk. Oh. (WIND BLOWS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) - Be careful! - Oh! (GOOFY LAUGHS) (SIGHS) I only wanted to make a good impression Now I must make a confession Wish I hadn't acted selfishly I guess I should apologize to you After all you've filled my life with laughter No doubt about it You've been so good to me I don't know why I was so worried 'Cause, strange but true You're my one and only dad And I'm so proud of you Mmm... (POPPING) GOOFY: Whoa! MONA: Oh! - Max! - Aah! You made me look good You made me shine You made me look so good It looks like I'm gonna make her mine You made me look good Everything's fine Everything's fine You made me look so good It looks like I'm gonna make her mine You made me look good MAX: Awesome Christmas, Dad! This is great! Aw, shucks. Hyuck! (ALL LAUGH) NARRATOR: When a father and son end up miles apart, they can see eye-to-eye when they act heart-to-heart. Sometimes Christmas gets lost in the holiday crush. It's, "Buy this, get that, remember to rush." But Donald just wants peace and quiet this yule. Can he enjoy Christmas and not lose his cool? -(BOINGS) {QUACKS) (MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTERING) - Aah! -(POPS) Merry Christmas! Yeah, merry Christmas. Say! (SLURPS) Ah... Hot chocolate.

Donner, I told you, never... I've never seen so many toys scattered. That barn came out of nowhere. Hey, who's hungry? Let's hit the trough, guys, huh? - Wait a minute. I'm the leader here. -(CLEARS THROAT) Hey, who's hungry? Let's hit the trough. Oh, who cares? Let's just eat. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (PANTS) (CHATTERING) Remember, now, easy on the grub. We've all read the story. We're supposed to be eight tiny reindeer. What? (LAUGHTER) Oh, man! Grain again? (WHIMPERS) I'm so hungry I could eat a horse. I'm not kidding. {BARKS) -(ALL GASP) But not a dog. -(WHIMPERS) - Oh. Look here. No collar. - Do you think he's a stray? - He strayed pretty far. What do you think? What do you think? Can we keep him? Can we? Yeah, that's a good idea. I knew you'd agree! You know what we'll name him? - I was just kidding. - Brace yourself for genius. There can only be one name for this dog. - Want to hear it? - No. - Murray. - ALL: Murray? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, like, "Murray Christmas." -(ALL GROAN) - Oh, my head. (DOOR CREAKING) Well, I don't need my sunglasses, but it'll do. Hmm? Something's missing. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. (WIND BLOWING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Uh... Hey, pal. I finished decorating. Well, almost. (CHUCKLES) There's just one thing left. Aw, come on, Pluto. Who's my pal? Who's my pal? Pal? Buddy? Hello? (GASPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, no. (DIALING) (LINE RINGING) - MINNIE: Hello. - Minnie, it's me. Thanks for the jingle. I'm not ho, ho, home, but leave me some Christmas cheer. -(BEEPS) - Pluto's run away. I got to find him. He's probably freezing, all alone, miserable. Christmas is ruined. This is just terrible. Cancel the party. Oh, this is Mickey. All right, inspection, you jingle-headed quadrupeds. Line up. (BARKING) BLITZEN: Now what? REINDEER: Look, he's after Winky! - Heads up! - Aah! BLITZEN: All right, who let the dog out? (GASPS) Get that... Oh, perfect. Hey, Murray, what, do you think, those ornaments grow on trees? Well, they do! (LAUGHTER) Ah, yeah, that never gets old. Enough reindeer games. Back to the sky, boys. We need to shave three minutes off our flight time. Oh, Blitzen, wait. I've got another genius idea. Oh, please share. Sit. Stay. Those are strictly for reindeer! Fly! Huh? Perfect. (CHATTERING) And they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks. - All right, boys. And, Murray. -(CHUCKLES) Let's go. (MUSIC SWELLS) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) (ENGINE STARTS) - Oh, great. They're plowing the roads. -(TRUCK HONKS HORN) Whoa! (DOOR OPENS) (GRUNTING) Hey! Just perfect. (GRUNTS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (PANTS) Ooh. (EXCITED GASP) (COOING) (WHIMPERS) (GRUNTING) -(GRUNTING) -(GIGGLES) Ah. Good times, huh? Hey, aren't you glad we brought Murray along? Oh, yeah. Flying dog. Good idea. Not interested, buddy. We have lots of presents to wrap. You can help me. (SCOFFS) (GRUNTS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (WHIMPERING) Oh! (WHIMPERING) (WHIMPERS) (LAUGHING) Hey, Donner, correct me if I'm wrong, and I know you will, but I think something's wrong with your dog. - Wow. Do you think he's airsick? - The air is a little thin at this altitude. Maybe he's cold. Do you think he's cold? It's partially cloudy, but warm. - Or maybe he's just hungry. - What, after eating my slippers? That's it! He's hungry! - What do you think, Blitz? -(PLUTO WHIMPERS) Are you going to let me answer? - Come on, Murray, hop on! - Guess not. Let's hit the elfeteria and see what's cooking, buddy, huh? You know, those elves make a mean shortbread. Get it? Because they're short! (LAUGHING) (WIND BLOWING) Aw, Pluto, If only I hadn't yelled at you. I promise I'll never raise my voice again. -(TRUCK HONKS HORN) - Huh? (YELLING) Stop! Stop! (HORN HONKS) (GRUNTING) Hmm. Oh, no! Oh. Hmm. How am I going to find you? -(FLASH BULB POPS) - Ho, ho, ho! GIRL: It's Santa! Hey, what's your name, little fella? - Mickey. Mickey Mouse. - Ho, ho, ho. So, tell me, Mickey. What do you want for Christmas? Well, it's kind of a long story, so I'll cut to the chase. I was decorating my house like always, but Minnie said I shouldn't. And I said I wouldn't, but I couldn't, because Pluto broke it. And I yelled, so he was in the doghouse. - Mmm-hmm. - But he wasn't in his doghouse, and there was this crazy snowplow, and then... Oh, wait. This isn't cutting to the chase, is it? Let me start again. (ALL GROAN) (CLEARS THROAT) (ALL GASP) So, anyway, Santa, Pluto's gone. All I want for Christmas is my best friend back. Hmm. Well, I'll... Gosh. I mean, that's a pretty tall order. I'll, uh, see what I can do. Smile! (SIGHS) Come on, Murray. - Whoa. He still hasn't eaten? - Not even an elf bite. Oh, Murray, do it for Donner, okay? We're friends, right? Come on, who's my pal? Who's my pal? You really big baby! Here's a good dog! (BARKS) - What's he doing? - A little kitty fell in a well? - You ever seen a dog do this? - The barn's on fire? Do you think it's a nervous tic? What? What are you talking about? I had a nervous tic once, but I sent him to therapy, and he got better. Oh, why do I bother? (WHIMPERING) DONNER: I wonder what he's thinking? (PLUTO WHIMPERING) (SOBBING) Oh, what did I do wrong? Oh, Donner, you haven't done anything wrong. -(GASPS) -(DOOR CLOSING) mm AmPlub'OMIunddgMd. Aw. Who's Pluto? - I think he's Murray. - Murray's Pluto? - Bingo. - Bingo's Pluto? Ah... Yes. Thinking about Mickey? (WHIMPERS) He misses you very, very much. You miss him, too, don't you? (SLURPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (WIND BLOWING) Aw, where are you, pal? (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (EXCLAIMS) -(SCREECHING) - BLITZEN: Let Murray lead the sleigh. Whose idea was that? DONNER: Yours. DONNER: Careful, careful. (GRUNTING) (WIND BLOWS) (BOTH GASP) -(GASPS) -(SWISHES) (CHUCKLES) Phew. Let's see the tooth fairy do that. -(CHUCKLES) -(PANTING) Oh. Thank you. - I'm going to miss you, buddy. -(WHIMPERS) Your name may be Pluto, but to me you'll always be Murray. (SLURPING) Yeah. Murray... Merry Christmas, Pluto. Welcome home. (SNAPS) (BARKING) Pluto? Pluto, is that you? (BARKING CONTINUES) (MUSIC SWELLS) Pluto! (BARKING) Come on, come on, come Oh! Uh-oh. (LAUGHING) (PANTING) (WHIMPERS) Of course. I'm sorry, Pluto. Thank goodness you're home. Who's my pal? Come on, who's my pal? (BARKING) (CHUCKLES) That's right. You are. You are, Pluto! -(TRUCK HONKS HORN) - Huh? Huh? Oh! (ENGINE DIES) (GRUNTING) - Hyuck! Hiya, Mick! - Goofy? (CHUCKLING) That's me! - That explains a lot. -(CHUCKLES) What are you guys doing here? We're here to help you find Pluto. (BARKS) NEPHEWS: We found him! Yay! Oh, Mickey, we were so worried. Uncle Scrooge even bought a snowplow company to help find him. Ah, it was marked down for Christmas. Come on, everybody. Let's go inside. (GASPS) Oh, Mickey! Look what you've done. 80 nice and simple. Oh, I love it. Well, you don't want to overdo it, right? (CHUCKLES) Right. Mmm! Why, it's absolutely perfect. Almost. (WHIMPERS) Now it's perfect. MINNIE: Ah. (CHUCKLING) NARRATOR: So, at last Mickey learned what he'd missed from the start. Bells and holly mean little without friends in your heart. The magic of Christmas has its rhyme and its reason. We hope you and yours have a most joyous season. And a happy New Year Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la Those jingle, jingle bells (MUSIC ENDS) SANTA“. Ho, ho, ho! (SLEIGH BELLS RINGING) (NEW MUSIC BEGINS) When I close my eyes all I do is think of you And I wonder if you feel the same way, too Will tonight be the night That everything will be just right? Beneath the wreaths of green I see it in my dreams We're all finding our way Through another holiday Wrapping hopes and dreams in angels' wings tonight Time to give and receive But the only gift I need Is to share this day and every day with you On my Christmas list there's a wish I hope will come true That this holiday brings me one step closer to you Let tonight be the night That every star's a diamond light The smile in your eyes A beautiful surprise We're all finding our way through another holiday Wrapping hopes and dreams in angels' wings tonight Time to give and receive But the only gift I need Is to share this day and every day with you What do I see What do I see In the morning light? My yuletide dream became reality We're all finding our way It's the greatest holiday Catching hopes and dreams on angels' wings tonight You're my heart, you're my home You're the hope I'll always know When I share this day and every day with you Joy to the world We're all finding our way It's the greatest holiday Flying higher on my angel's wings tonight You're my heart, you're my home You're the hope I'll always know When I share this day and every day with you Joy to the world Share this day Joy to the world Day with you Share this day Day with you Joy to the world Share the day Just me and you Joy to the world Me and you Joy to the world Share this day (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING) CHORUS: (SINGING) Dong, ding, dong (CHORUS SINGS) Ding, dong Ding, dong (CHORUS SINGS) (CHORUS SINGS) (CHORUS SINGING) (CHORUS SINGING) (MUSIC ENDS)
