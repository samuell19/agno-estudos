EVERY HOUSE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM. What is this painting about? Not sure! But it seems like someone is lost at sea. There is a ship also dude. Yeah dude. Hey, this painting is beyond my understanding. Let's see the next one. Hey your Anitha, right! Yeah. So what is this painting about? It is the story of a young sailor. He has no clue about his final destination. And this is the reason he is stuck in a thunderstorm. Oh! Then, did he reach the shore? Uh! Uh! I don't think so. I believe, he is lost forever. I am the lost sailor in Anitha's painting! My name is Kishore. Most of my classmates are settled. But I am with my parents in my hometown. This is not something I am doing this early morning. I didn't sleep all night. Working on my new project. I am constructing a robotic vehicle. Completely autonomous. It manoeuvres avoiding obstacles. I am just finishing it. Kishore, it is morning! Will you come out of your room? There you go, my mom. She loves me a lot since I am the only son. Hey Kishore, why don't you answer? What is the matter? Did he brush his teeth? And this is my dad, tiger! All this while he hasn't been happy because things didn't happen the way he expected. All Indian guys who graduate have only one question, what's next? Some families insist on a job and some on doing IAS. And few others advise an MBA. And these are the expectation set on us. For people like me, it's like when is this guy going to America? Kishore, did you get a visa to America at least this time? My family has double expectations for me. With all the cousins going to America, the pressure on me is like 'Crap! Feels as if I am in a pressure cooker'. [pressure cooker hissing] How long did you take... Here take it. I'll give this to your dad. -Oh! For Tiger! -Get a dozen eggs. Alright. -Hi Kishore, -Hi Dude. You seem so happy. I guess you got your visa. Why should you know? Give me a dozen eggs. Did I ask your property? Here take the eggs. I did not get this time either. It got rejected. Why don't you apply for the 3rd time, it's lucky. You will get it for sure, I guarantee you. Hey, come along we will play cards near the Maisamma temple. Stop it! You visit the Chilukuru Balaji temple and you will definitely get a visa. -Go. Get lost. -Hey, come let's play cards. Brother-in-law, trust me and go to Balaji temple and you will definitely get your visa. He is not your brother-in-law, he will not get it. You keep calm. -You say so? -Yeah. We are not at all related. Hey, look at Trump's daughter how gorgeous she is. Split on my life! Even the boys in the gully like Mogli and Satti are commenting on me. So sad! Heard that your visa got rejected again. So what will you do now? It's better people mind their own business. -Oh! -My time is running badly. Even the aunty who doesn't know where to dump the trash is asking about my visa. -Did you get it... -Take it. Why is everyone so interested in me? Everyone is asking me about the visa. Jobless people! It is their wish too that Narayan's son should go to America. They are waiting for it. They are wishing you good. It is because of my dad that everyone knows about this. That I am applying for my visa. Do you see any young guy around here? I told you I will get bored. -You got me here unnecessarily. -Why will be they be here? All the guys of your age are settled in the US. I am sure you will be there next year. You will no longer be annoyed by these occasions. Kishore, I heard your visa got rejected again. Why don't you work at a call centre until you get it? -Thanks for the advice uncle. -Okay! Be it any occasion in the town, everyone is after me. Hell with this people. Mom, if I am here everyone will keep asking me about my visa. When I will leave for America. They question me again and again, 'so when are you going to try again'. I can't take this anymore. I won't stay here. I will... dad, I will go to Hyderabad. I will stay there and get the visa somehow. "This guy is leaving his hometown and going to the city in a bus," "look at the strange difficulties" -"It's not that normal" -Since my childhood, my father raised me to be in America. This is America... This is New York. Here your uncle and aunt live and their children. One drives a BMW while the other drives an AUDI car. -This is Atlanta. -Atlanta. Another uncle and aunt and their is their son. -He is studying at Georgia Tech. Get it? -Yes. This is Chicago. Here all your mother's side relatives stay. She is... Hey is your aunt still alive? She has passed away long back. She has passed away it seems... We don't need this picture anymore. So tell me now, where will you stay? Here? Here! You should travel all over... okay? You should roam all over, okay? Good. Chandu, tell me the names of some rivers... Ganga, Yamuna, Brahmaputra, Krishna, Sir. Very good. Sit down. Kishore, name some states... New York, California, Texas, Florida. Hey Britisher, tell me about Indian states, not American states. He opined that I will stay back in India if I took up any job. My dad didn't let me attend any interview. To state the truth, going to Hyderabad is like an escape for me. From that world of expectations. "Seeing you she keeps her eyes open" "Or even to make the aunty's close her mouth who stays beside my house" VILLAGE LIGHT "Go boy, go on fly in the sky" "To make your father proud" "Go boy, go on fly in the sky" "Why do you panic?" "You... hey you!" Chandu and Pavan are my college mates. It is unbelievable that they are living here. I am sure they have changed a lot over time. Show me your biceps now that you are going to the gym. -Look man, look here. -Hey, hi guys! -Hi, Kishore. -Hey Kishore... Hey, my throat! Hey, my throat, careful, the bag has glass jars. -Oh god! -Your are just like a cucumber. [laughs] -Hey, get up guys. Hey, come dude. No need to go to home, -will go from here itself. -Come on, we will have a party. Only after meeting them, I realized that they haven't changed a bit. Hey, Chandu wait... You look like you are selling hair wigs. 9,998, 9,999... 10,000... Hey Kishore, when is your visa interview? -It's next week... Wednesday. -Okay. -4... -By the way, what is he up to? -It's his new fantasy. -6... When your father is sending you money... Why don't you sit at home happily? What is this underwear modelling job? I have only one ambition in my life. That my hoarding should be all over Hyderabad. And all the guys and girls should be amazed to see me. They should think, "Wow! What a model!" Oh! If I have a father like you who sends money, "I will leave this gaming designer job." And I'll cross my legs, read the newspaper, drink tea and enjoy my life! Aren't you doing the same now! -You are out... -No, no it's not an out. -Check yourself... -Good morning. Good morning! -How is the weather? -It is a snowstorm. -So it must be cold. -Yeah. It is so hot here in Hyderabad, and you are talking about snow? We are talking about Chicago. His son lives there. -Chicago? -Yes. -The one in America? -Yeah. Haha... Sir, it's too much. Hey, clean it... here too... clean the tank... Make this bike shine like a new one. -By the way, how much does spinach cost? -3 dollars. -Oh! Is it so expensive? -Yes... -It is only for two dollars in Texas. -Is it? Everything is cheap there. There is no sales tax right. -Is it? -Yes... My son is in California and the living standard is very costly. I should ask my son to move to Texas. What is wrong with everyone in these apartments? They talk only about America! All these apartments have been bought by NRI's and all their parents live here. All the time you will only get to hear about America. Hey, what is this? You are making a child clean your bike? Do you even have a brain? -What is your name? -Munna, sister. Munna, don't you ever clean bikes, okay? Okay, sister. Are you not ashamed? Do you even have a brain? Hey, who are you? -Why are you scolding my friend? -Oh! You are all one batch? -Are you even educated? -What happened man? What is your problem? Why are you creating a scene here? Your friend is making a child work. Don't you know that child labour is a crime? I'll report it to the police, next time. Madam, we are sorry, it won't happen next time. -Alright? -Okay! Make your friends understand this and have some sense. Oh my God, who is this troublesome girl? -Where does she lives? -How do I know? -Hey, what is your name? -Munna bro... Don't work like this for money. Go and study well. -Okay? -Sure, brother. Go now... Bloody hell! Where do these guys come from? What happened dear? Whom did you fight with today? [sighs] Dad, someone is making a small child work. Why do they rent the apartments to bachelors? What happened dear? Did someone trouble you? I hope no you are fine. Are you silly? What can happen to her? Did anyone ever win over her? -Hmm... -Dad. -I am just saying. -My dear, come here, sit. Anitha... Why do you want to get into a fight and all? You are my sweet daughter. Look at these pictures once, You are getting very good NRI alliances for marriage. Did you like anyone? Hmm, yes I like this car, this house, and this bike! I asked you about the boys and not the cars or houses. Find out if the boy comes free with the car or house. You won't change! Keep painting, teaching here and there for free. You won't get married if you keep doing social service. And here you are quiet as a lamb. Here, here, stop... Thank god! Careful... careful This is all from America. Look there, the flowers have bloomed so well. Watchman, watchman... He is never around when in need. By the way, the watchman's son was supposed to join in engineering, I guess he got into the course by now, It smells so bad and dirty, India will not get tidy in this birth. I heard Trump is building a wall... What do you think the height will be? Aunty, do you need any help? Thank you, the watchman will come. I wonder where he is and when he'll come. These suitcases are very heavy. Please help us! Pick those two. Watchman! -Which is your flat, aunty? -705, son. -Watchman. -Ours is 604. Watchman... Is he dead? -Aunty, are you coming from America? -Yes! Both my sons live in America. -We are just back after a visit. -I see. My first son is in Microsoft, he graduated from Texas university. Scored very high in GRE. -From where you dear? -I am from 'Cdiypet'! -C..di..petu? -Siddipet, uncle. -Oh! -Siddipet? -My second son is with IBM... -Oh! -in Atlanta. -I see. -Oh! Even my friend is going to America. -Oh! Good. He has his visa interview next week. What do you do? Software, something. -I just roam around freely! -Ah! Come on Uncle. Thank God, power is there. One minute. -Ok, we shall leave now. -Bye aunty. -Wait, take some chocolates. -Oh! No aunty, it's okay. -It's okay. -It is okay. Take it. It is all so dusty. Take it. -Thank you, aunty. -Thank you, aunty. Hey, give it to me. -Hey. -Get lost. Won't you change a bit? The gas is not there. If I book it now, I wonder when he'll deliver. Should I buy it in black or something! It was so nice to spend time with our children there. The joy we get is so precious. I cannot go about these trips to America anymore. I wish that our children stayed with us here in India. India? Huh! The youngsters in India have no goal or destination. Neither they have the determination to achieve something. Look at our children. They are so determined. They are well settled in America. We should be proud of them. [reciting adhan] What are you doing so early in the morning? You still have three hours to your interview. Are you going to keep guard there? You and your eagerness, Son... you'll be successful only if you go to America. It is a waste to do anything here in India. "With the GRE score, with an SOP file" "and your passport under your arms," "taking care of the deadline..." "Be it Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Kingston" "or the place in the outskirts, Dakota, whichever it is, just join" "Be it Intel, Cyntel, Philips or Gilips," -"find a job that will help you settle." -Thank you, you can leave. Next! Where does your son live? -Disneyland, Sir. -What! Dear, you are not giving the right answers. You don't speak, I know what to say. Where does your son work? -Niagara Falls. -What? I can't believe this. Your visa is rejected. -Hi. -Hello. -Where did you graduate from? -MIT. MIT? Do you mean Massachusetts Institute of Technology? -No, it is Medak Institute of Technology. [laughs] Okay! -Good luck! -Yo! Peace. Mr. Deepak... What is your purpose to visit the US? Purpose? Why anyone goes to America? -Good life, good car, good house! -Okay. I go, take picture with car, send photo... You know... I get one crore dowry! So how about your parents? Who will take care of them? -We will talk on face time... -Okay. if they fall sick they go to hospital. I send money every month, after marriage, they come for delivery! Okay! Good luck! Thank you! Thank God, she approved my visa! Thank God, she is approving everyone's visa. Cake ready! The cake looks as colorful as you! It tastes good too, "Kishore will come this day, he will come anyway..." -Hey... -Hurray. -Congratulations! -Hey, stop it. Oh no! Hey, what happened? So, Mr. Kishore... Which university are you going to study? Michigan. Can I see your I 20, please? Yes, one second. -One second madam. -Hmm, okay. So, why do you want to study in the US? Cause it's my dad's dream. He always wanted me to go to the US and pursue my Master's. Hmm... Your visa is rejected. Sorry! Maybe next time. Hey, miser. He did not get his visa approved. Hmm, the cake might get wasted. [phone rings] Dad, I just got back from the embassy. -Are you always worried about food? -What happened is... Eat, rub it on your face. What happened? His visa is rejected again. Madam, what happened? -His visa is rejected again. [gasps] Oh! My God, why did this happen again? So what do you mean to say? All those working in Indian software companies are useless? No, I don't say that. You should come to my house and see it for yourself. If I go to my town without a visa, I'll have to fly kites. To get a visa for America is like a lottery. You never know who will win. It is not easy to win a lottery ticket. It is not easy to win a lottery ticket. Sambaiah in my village, never got lucky with lottery tickets. Not even one time. Hey, don't talk nonsense without knowing what we are talking about. Just as he said, it is like winning a lottery ticket. I worked hard for GRE, TOFEL, got admission in a good college. In spite of all this, they issue a visa to every other person but not me. That Shiva passed all his exams copying from my papers. Even that fellow got a visa. What is with this GRE score? Shit man! When a student visa get rejected so many times, I can't get it again. Chandu, I have to do something else. Pavan, what are you up to? I auditioned for Calvin Klein and I am almost through... Which one, American or the Sultan Bazaar one? Oh! You know well about fashion. Here she is, Anita... -Come dear, sit. -Come dear... I heard that you paint well... Did you sell any? No aunty... As of now, it is just a hobby. Oh! It's her pastime. Okay, okay. Please stand up. Let's see. Her height is a bit short sister-in-law. I am planning to take up a job in software. Oh! Sister-in-law, We can't expect everyone to raise their children properly now a days. We shall take leave now. Good. How dare they talk like that about my daughter. What do they know about my Anita. She is good in studies, painting, art and craft... Is there anyone like my daughter? I am getting angry thinking about that... How can they talk like that? Yeah, what was the thing you did? You were after her marriage. You don't have to worry about her marriage at all. Stop going after the 'American' alliance. I am sure a good guy will come looking for her. I am telling this remember this... -No girl will flicker at us... -Oh, study. At least let that tube light flicker at us... Do you have to fix something or the other? -Hey! -Don't slap me on my face. Uncle is coming... Why are they staring at us? [car honks] Look Doctor, guys in India keep loitering in the night. They aways waste their time. They don't have discipline. Doctor, my kids never wasted their time. They were so inclined in studies. -It's all about parenting. -You are right! Get in the car. Greetings uncle, did you meet Trump? Hey... you will die man! Bye uncle. Hey, where is Texas university? -Don't you know? -Don't you know? -He will say. -I'll tell you. -While going to Charminar... -Yeah! There is a bangles shop at Gowliguda Chaman, right? Yeah, there is one. -There it is in the beside street. [laughing] Hi. -Hi! -Can I meet Jeevan Reddy? -He is inside. Please go. -Thank you. Let's go. -Why are you standing here? -You go, I'll come. -Ah... Hi... -Hi. -Me, myself Pavan. -I am Tanya Nice name. Look there. Hey, I don't think this will work out. You have no work experience. How can he get you a visa? Stop nagging always... -Hi Praneet... how are you? -Hello Sir. -I got my visa for America. -Very good. I am leaving for Kansas next week. Than you sir, it is all because of you. -Oh! You brought Motichoor Ladoo... -Yes sir. -Thank you! -Okay. What's up, Kishore... Ramesh uncle has called me about you. You don't worry at all, you will go to America. Look there, H1B visa. All our guys are in America. Sir, but I don't have any work experience. [laughs] What's with experience? Look here, Narayana... not him. This guy Ganesh has only one year experience. But we tweaked his resume and showed an experience of six years. These Americans are innocent. They believe whatever is written in the papers. Many people went there just like this. You just have to learn some new technical terms. What is the latest trend these days? -Big data... Mule soft... -Big data... Mule soft... -That's it... -What do you say? -Will this all happen with-in a week? -What do you think Kishore? Is this an order on Swiggy to be delivered in one hour? This is about your job, it will take a month or so. I will confirm a job in Metro apps, California. Then you can apply for your H1 visa. What say. Here you go. Meet Mr. Srinivas. -He will explain everything to you. -Hello sir. You don't worry. You are in big professional hands. -Okay. -Okay? Hey, Beard! have some biscuits. Looking at your friend, I am sure he will go to Dubai. Dubai is correct for you, -I will send you there. -Hey, no sir. [laughs] -Srinivas, explain him. Sure sir. Sir, let me walk you through the entire process. These are the documents required. [voice muted] What more, I am sure you will get a visa. You will go to America and I will call you from India and over the call you'll say, 'Hey Chandu! I am at Florida beach'. 'I am drinking beer with babes in bikini on either side.' -Isn't it. -Yes dude. "We've kicked you our of your sleep, we've ironed your clothes" "We've passed notes for you in your exams, yeah!" "We've danced in stranger's weddings! Yeah!" "Don't know whether you'd remember us once you fly!" "Oh dude! My friend! Don't forget our friendship" "Oh dude! My friend! We'll add up likes to your photos" "Oh dude! My friend! Send us bucks to booze" "We've done some real nasty and naughty things at places" "We've went places with friends, peed into tanks" "We've been a menace at different places and troubled people" "We've danced weird and flew kites and cut a few" "Do the same things there too!" "Oh dude! My friend! Fetch a good job there" "Oh dude! My friend! Don't fal behind bikini clad girls" "Oh dude! My friend! Bring back some good money with you" "You aren't any less than anyone nor you need to fear any damn person" "There's no lack of girls there, no one is better than us" "The birds there are agressive, watch out! Check out the flies around" "Water there is cotlier than sodas, be careful not to make a mistake" "Oh yeah!" "You'd fly emirates from rags, drive in costly cars" "You'd check out Chicago and dance at costly pubs" "Drink pricey liquor at trendy places" "Change your eating habits and your favourite sport too" "And then spend all your earnings in Las Vegas" "Oh dude! My friend! Don't do idiotic things!" "Oh dude! My friend! Don't ruin yourself" "Oh dude! My friend! Send us some trendy clothes" "Oh yeah!" [doorbell rings] The committee has called in for a meeting. Everyone should attend, come soon. Yes, come boys, come. Guys of this generation are neither led by education nor manners. -Who is Sandhya? -I guess it is her! Their jobs are substandard but behave flamboyantly. Otherwise why will they get fully drunk? And these guys have full grown beard and moustaches... -Nonsense. -Shall we get started. Boys, you are the main issue here. We've received a complaint against you. It has come to our notice about what you did to Anitha and Latha. There are harassment charges against you. -What? -Harassment? Cheers! "Daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, Golla Mallamma" [knocks on door] Hey, someone is at the door. Go check... [knocks on door] Oh! It's you. Did you come to have a argument again? So whom do you want to scold this time? I have exams and I am studying. For that do you have to knock the door and tell us? [giggles] -I guess she needs chits. Yuck! Aren't you ashamed. How should I ready when you are making fuss? -Do you know what is the time now? -I don't know. It is 12:30, it's past midnight. If you know the time, why are you asking us? Chill, just go home, drink cerelac and sleep well. Get up early in the morning and study you will remember better. Yes, dude. -Hey, do you have an exam in Database? -Hey, very is my beer? -Did you go through Query Optimisation? -Yes. It's a very important topic. That question comes every time. Hey stop it dude. I have a doubt. Are you really getting disturbed or just following us? Huh, you think your are so worth it? -Why not? -Now? What is happening? Hey, are these guys troubling you? Tell me who that is? -Who is this girl? -I think daughter-in-law of Golla Mallamma You are not the kind to listen when told properly. Wait and watch what I'll do tomorrow. This is not the way to deal with these guys, let's take care of them tomorrow. Let's go now. Angry Birds! Did I ever tell that you look very sexy when you make that monkey face? [laughs] Let's go inside, you don't know how to open the door. Actually this can be a police case. But thinking about your future, so the committee has decide that you vacate the apartment immediately. What is happening here? Can anyone explain us? We received a complaint that you guys physically teased... -...Anitha and Lata yesterday. -Why will we harass? -These are all cooked up stories. [gasps] She is unnecessarily trapping us. But how can you take a decision just by listing to one side of the story? That is not done uncle, you should give us a chance to explain as well. -What would you want to listen? -Listen... tell us whatever you want in a straight forward manner. Nothing like that uncle, actually Anitha... Anitha, please wait outside for some time. We will call you again. Oh God! What is this? Why should I wait outside? Please... Latha, please tell us what happened yesterday wihout getting scared of anyone. Yesterday on the seventh floor, Kishore and Chandu... ...teased Anitha by pinching her waist. -Okay uncle, now call Anitha and ask her. -Anitha... Anitha please tell us what happened. What happened yesterday is... Kishore held Latha's hand firmly and pulled her hair. Oh! -Are you sure? -Did you listen uncle? Was it really Kishore who teased Latha? Err... yes, sure uncle. -It was Kishore who teased Latha. -Okay. Then nobody teased you? Uh! Uh! No uncle, nobody teased me. Hmm... -What else? -Hmm... -Oh no! -I think we all would have understood. And it's totally a waste of time to prolong this. Sorry boys, the charges are baseless. You may leave now. Why did you say that? Will you all leave them just like that? Won't you say anything? Anitha, do you know that harassment case can turn into a criminal case? It is not right to play the fool with guys. Take care. By the way, who will fall for this short girl? Does she think that she is very beautiful? Please do not judge a girls beauty by her skin color or height. [phone rings] [gasps] It is her again. Hmm... I think I've seen you before. Yes, I remember you. You are the one who spoke really fast. How did you get this three year experience? -Ma'am I can explain you. -When did you graduate? When did you graduate? Clearly Kishore, you've submitted wrong documents. -You're cheating. -Ma'am, ma'am, I am sorry. You visa is rejected. And you cannot apply to the US for one year. Take it and leave. Next... -Drive carefully. -Hey, hey which way are you going? Drive properly. -Hey, hey, are you going to die? -Hey, have you informed at home? Hey, stop it, stop it dude! Damn! Why should the same lady be in the embassy? Why should she remember me? My bad luck! Looks like all the bad luck of the world in sitting right on my head. What should I do when I am not allowed to apply for visa for another year? Shit. Hey shall we put up a business? Underwear business. It's a fetching business. Hey, is this some kind of a joke? You wanted to be an underwear model and you are one. My father has drawn a line which I've no other option except to follow it blindly. Dude. Is there any rule to follow what parents say? My father used to drop me to GRE classes and wait for me until the class was over. Do you know that? I cannot disappoint him. [birds chirping] It is fine, my son if you did not get it. What is wrong now? You will get it soon. You don't worry at all. Oh! My gosh, you did not get your visa... Chukamma, don't cry. I will get the visa next time. Go put the bags inside, go... -What is this mom? -She is crazy... Hey Kishore.. Heard your visa is rejected again. So let's go and play cards near Maisamma temple. -Ah? -Hey, no... Hey, leave him. I will come. Will you get me toddy? Yes, sure. -Who is that guy? -Which kind of toddy can you give me? Don't know dude, let's go, otherwise he will come along. Hey wait, I am coming. -Wait a minute. -Yeah, take him he will be suitable. -Aunty. -Hmm? Masala daal and the tamarind soup is very delicious. Here taste this pickle of grated mango made by aunty. It is very delicious. -Pavan, do you want some more? -No uncle, that was enough... Yes, please uncle. -So what work do you do? -Modelling uncle. -Oh! You make models? -No uncle. He's an underwear model. He wears underwear's and poses in front of camera. Oh! is it? Do people earn money like that too? Fascinating! [mobile beeps] [dog barks] What is this phone uncle. Looks like a very old model. This is a special phone. Back in those days when the electricity went off, someone or the other had go to the fields to switch on and off the motor. And someone died by a snake bite. In those days when he was in his tenth class, he loaded a special software in this phone. And I control the motor right through phone sitting in the house. -I use it even to this day. -Is it so? Uncle, there a lot good software companies in Hyderabad now. After when Trump was elected as the president... I mean to say that going to America is no longer fun. It is better for him to stay here in Hyderabad and get a good job. Yes dad, if it is a corporate company... What are you talking about? No matter what, my son has to go to America. I don't care what he'll do there. I should take pride in telling everyone that he is in America. Everyone in this town should say that Narayan's son is in America. Son... I don't know what you will do, you've to go to America. That's it! [knocks on door] [door opens] God! What is your problem? Is it about another complaint? Should we attend the committee meeting again? -Nothing like that. -Then? I've come to thank you. For what? For your support in the committee. -Thanks. -You are most welcome. There is the concept right! A couple of words to speak, little tea and some biscuits! What? I mean to say... will you come for a coffee? I cannot come. I mean I don't drink coffee. Oh! Okay then! Bye. Hey girl... What is that in your hand? Oh! These are leaflets for art competition. -Oh! -Hmm. You can come too if you like. To paint or just see? Because I am not too keen on art Think about it. I can assure that there would be hot girls there. Let me see. I have my friend's birthday party too... -So I don't know. -Hmm, okay. Damn! Where did I find this guy? Seriously, unromantic! Just because someone advised you, you are meeting this American citizen girl? Bloody! Will you try just about anything to go to America? Are you crazy? Don't we comply with arranged marriages in India? -This is just like that. -Yes! If this fellow marries her, he will automatically become an American citizen. -Hmm. -Then he doesn't have to worry about visa. -Absolutely. -And no fuss about green card. Hey you half minded fellow, don't encourage him for no good reason. -Hi. -Hi. -This is Padma Kalyan. -Hi, I am Kishore, -have your seat. -Nice to meet you, -thank you -Hi, this is Pavan. Nice to meet you too. -You know, I love India. -Oh! I love India and it's culture. This is the first time I am coming to India. I have a very unknown connect with this country. Do you know? This is the land of Kama sutra. We taught the world about the art of lovemaking. Oh, it gives me goose bumps! Even when thinking about it. -What's the deal here? -Yeah! -I cannot understand. -My clock is ticking. -I need a baby immediately. -Baby? I cannot wait. So Kishore, -tell me how good are you? [scoffs] My husband should fulfil all my desires. She would be perfect for me. Desires mean not chocolates, biscuits. Did you every read the book of Kama Sutra? It would be this thick. Look, I am a career oriented women. My husband should do the laundry, ironing... should be able to cook and clean the dishes... -pick and drop me, you know? -She is looking for a servant. Please don't mind, I have an urgent work to attend to. By the way, have a good luck. In finding your ideal servant, I mean a good husband in India. -Hey let us go. -What! Isn't it better to meet the other three girls? Hey dude that first Love guru girl, she was beautiful why did you reject her? Let us get her married to him, will you marry her? Buy that book, she will teach you a lesson every day. Chandu is feeling jealousy. Enough now. What's up? You're looking at my painting. -Did you paint this? -Hmm! -Oh, it looks amazing. -Thanks. Wow! It's like 'expressism' mixed with 'postmodern, surrealism'! Isn't it just like that? So, do you paint as well? No, no, I am an art connoisseur. I keep loving art! -Oh! -By the way, I am Jignesh. -Jittula Jignesh. -Oh! Nice... -I am Anita. -Hi! Hey, that's a nice painting. Let me take a look. Bro, what does 'art connoisseur' mean? You cannot understand! Hey. Anita... look here... This painting depicts a grief-stricken girl who is lonely, waiting for her beau. -Look closely. -Huh? I can't believe it. Excuse me, please. Who put this painting upside down? Yeah, this is correct. The sad, lonely girl's world turned upside down! And the first prize goes to 'Twilight dreams' by Anita. [crowd applause] -Hey, congratulations! Thank you! Very good. This is my card. And if you are interested we can arrange a solo show with your paintings. Sure, sir. -All the best! -Thank you. -Yes! -Hey, congrats! Isn't it nice? So are you doing any job? Uh! Uh! Not really. I am trying to go to the US. I will go to America someday for sure. -That is my ultimate goal, you know. -What? [laughs] -Your goal is very whimsical. -Why do you say so? -Going to America is your ultimate goal? -Yes! How can going to a place be a goal? Think for once, if someone says... 'Going to Nagpur is my ultimate goal?' What you wanna do in Nagpur and what can you do is of more importance. Your goal should be achieving something in America. Going to America can't be your goal. Hello madam, you will understand that if you come to my house. Okay... why don't you say something? -I want to tell you something. -Yes? I don't like coffee at all. But I love ice cream. -Let me buy you one. [chuckles] "Feel my love, feel my love!" -Hey Kishore, I am getting late. -Why don't you drop me? Huh! Do you think I have no other work? -I've a plan for a movie with my friends. -Huh! I just asked you because we live in the same apartment. Huh! I am breaking our friendship. Huh! Hey! 'Rudrammadevi', wait I will drop you. Huh! Ok then, we are friends. "The cool breeze has noticed..." "my breath that's getting heavier" "Every small path has notice..." "where my destination is" "The lily has noticed..." "the strange silence that blooms" "My eyes have noticed..." "the dreams they have" "Why don't you look at me?" "Why don't you notice the changes in me?" "Why do you stay in your own world?" "How can you not notice my presence?" "Can I chant someone's name in so many ways?" "I've known that for the first time with my age" "Time chases me..." "to tell you the truth" "You don't look at me" "like I'm not your girl" "Don't take the wrong way..." "in search of mirages" "Why don't you look at me?" "Why don't you notice the changes in me?" "Why do you stay in your own world?" "How can you not notice my presence?" Yes, I will take care of it. I am there for you. Okay! So Kishore, -Sir? -you don't worry. Your work will be done. You will go to America for sure. So, next week RITA is conducting a dance program in New Jersey. You mean, Rita, is that... Hey, pervert... -Shut your mouth and sit! -RITA is not a girl. RITA stands for 'Royal Indian Telugu Association'. It is in New Jersey. And you're going to America in that dance troop. -Thank you, Sir. -You don't need to thank me. Thank me when you go there. And next time when you come, get me 25 lakhs, okay? [phone rings] -Okay... -The minister is calling me. Sir, Sir... Tell me sir. Yes, sir... TANA, ATA, NATA and now RITA is also finished... Hey Kishore, once you go to America, form an association called PATA. What is PATA? Panileni (Jobless) American Telugu Association. You become the President of this group of jobless people. Receive all the respected members who fly to the US, arrange road shows, dances and gulp all the money. And get into every cheap thing. Okay? [cicadas chirping] [vehicles honking] Dad, that is... I found a way to go to America, What! 25 lakhs? Will you got to America for sure if you get 25 lakhs? Don't worry, I will arrange that money. [cicada chirping] Ashok bro, I've never asked anything from you. I am asking you for the first time. I need some money. My son is going to America. It's about his life. If you want I will mortgage my fields. Thanks, bro. I will never forget your help. Hey, did Pavan go to Jubilee bus stand? Uncle Ramulu told me that he gave the money to Pavan. And this guy has switched off his phone. [siren wailing] -Is it ringing? -No. My dad is sending me the money saying that my happiness is his happiness, ...by keeping his fields on mortgage. And what is Pavan up to now? I don't know [siren wailing] Hi... -You idiot... [chuckles] what's the time now? Where did you go? What took you so long? What happened man? Where did you go? We have been waiting till then. Balayya Babu's movie released today. How do you think I will miss it? -Okay, give me the bag. -Why is your mobile switched off? You don't know that mobile phones should be switched off in a cinema theatre? -You! -He is like that, It will take some time for us. You leave now. -You come in. -Dude. They will say so... -we should know how to deal with it. -Naresh garu, -Yes? -here are the 25 lakhs. Keep it inside. Look Kishore, I will start all the paperwork immediately. You will get a visa within ten days. [siren wailing] [tyres screeching] As soon as you land in New Jersey, you can go wherever you want and do whatever you like. But you shouldn't speak about me or how you went there to any one. -Understand? -Hey. -Are you Naresh Babu? -Yes Sir. -Pratap, take him into custody. -Sir? Okay sir. Hello. What is this custody? -Hey. -Come on. Sir, SI garu, who do you think I am . Sir, I am giving jobs to unemployed youth in America. -Is it? -It is a social service. -Is it? -Yes. Is this your social service? We take money saying we're are going to send them to Dubai, but we don't. That's it. Keep the money inside. What is this? You should know managing. This business is all about management. Is this enough to prove you wrong? Let's go. Get them all into the jeep. Come on. Sir, one person took our money and he went that way. Hey brother, stop speaking in 'English'. And get these guys into the jeep as well. Move... -Sir, sir... it's not the like that. -Come on, let's go. -Sir... -Hey, move! -Move! -Hey, call the minister. -Sir... -Please sir... A person took 25 lakhs from us and he is inside sir. -Yes, sir. -Is it? Swear sir. -Hey Pratap, -Sir? -go and check if anyone is inside. -Okay, sir. -Where are you going? Come with me. -Please sir. Come soon. Move. -Sir, our money. -Hey, he has gone to fetch for him. -He will come. -25 lakhs, sir! -What happened Pratap? -Hey... Sir, I am coming. -Sir, that is... -Wait man! -What happened? -Brother? There is no one inside, I've searched all over the place. -Ah! -Is it? Hey, move... get into the jeep. -Sir, it is not like that sir. -Move! -Move! Move! -Hey... Move, enough of all the drama. -Get in... -Dude, it's 25 lakhs! Close the door. Close it. "Oh! My son Kishore" "What a serious fraud" "Oh son, fraud it is" "Oh son, fraud it is" "did you get to know of the fraud now?" Sir is calling you. Hmm, okay uncle. Come, come, get in. -Uncle. -That Naresh Babu is a big fraudster. I think these guys don't know. Else, they would've got trapped in a big crime. Uncle, it is good that you came. They are safe now. You should be careful guys. That Seenu is also a big fraud, he took all the money and escaped uncle. -How did you bear that dude? [vehicles honking] Didn't they beat you? Let them go I'll talk to you. -Not like that... -Uncle you have helped us so much. Thank you so much. Kishore, wouldn't I do the same if my children were in your place? Come on. Dude, there wasn't a single mosquito inside. -Moreover the tiles were so smooth. -Then let us go take a selfie. -Hey, I beg you come let's go. -Hey! [knocks on door] Dad? What is all this? 'The gang who was illegally sending youngsters to America has been caught.' 'Cops took Kishore and Chandra Shekar in custody who are from Siddipet.' I never thought that your name would come like this in news paper. Where is the money? Dad, that is someone took all the money in... ...yesterdays police raid. How simply you told that you've lost. I sent you money by keeping our land for mortgage as I want you to go to America. You didn't went to America moreover you have lost those 25 lakhs. How can I show my face in our town? Everything has been spoiled. Dad, I'll stay here earn money and return them back. What did you say? Will you return them back? Do you think money grows on trees? Do you think earning 25 lakhs living in India is that simple? Hey, make your friend understand, how hard is to earn 25 lakhs. You are right uncle. You didn't work anywhere until now, then how would you earn? I dreamt for you to go to America and settle down. How will you settle down here? Dad, where are you going? Sorry dad. Mom, is alone and worried at home, I should go. Dad wait. There used to be a Sarpanch in our town. His name is Seenu. He had only one aim, to make his son Ramu a doctor. When he did not get a seat anywhere in Indian, Seenu brother sent Ramu to Russia. Ramu went to Russia and became a doctor. He settled in Russia, bought a house. He also got married and had kids. All of a sudden he came back to our town, and living happily by doing farming. Why are you telling me all this now? It took 35 years for Ramu to realise what he wants in life. And once he realised this, he is happy. I think that is what defines our success! We should know what we want in life that make us happy from inside. [doorbell rings] What is it Kishore, are you okay? Uncle, can I talk to you now? Please come. -Come. [cicadas chirping] So tell me. What's the matter? Uncle, did your sons face any problems before going to the US? Uh! Uh! No. They got their visa in their first attempt. Got admission into a top college. and a good placement while in graduation. Both of them are now working in top companies. Uncle, glad to know about your sons. But what should I do? I've tried a lot to go to the US but failed at every attempt. It's been 1 year that I've completed my degree. I don't even have a job and on top of it, I've to give my parents 25 lakhs. What advice will you if your sons are in my position? Life does not run according to us, Kishore. But neither can you achieve anything instantly. Develop your career and work hard towards your goal. Even if you to the US, this is what will help you. Next, Kishore. -Please be seated. -Thank you! -Mr. Kishore... -Sir? It's been more than a year since you graduated and you've no work experience. -So what were you doing all these days? -Sir, I was planning to go to the US. -So I did not take up any job. -So, you didn't work at all? -No, sir. -Ah! You don't have any work experience. Sorry, Kishore, we cannot give you this position. -Sir, at least consider me as a fresher. -That's not possible Kishore. We consider only those who graduated this year as freshers. Sorry, better luck next time! Please. You have no work experience. So we can't give you a job. Sir, I am trying for a job because I have no experience. No, no. You completed your degree last year, right? We need experience, that's it. Sir, tell me where I can find experience. I will go get it. Sir, it's true that I wasted a year. But if nobody is ready to give me a job how will I gain experience? If it is so, what is the situation of people like me? Sorry Kishore, you will not get a job in any MNC. Kishore, hi. You like Umpa, so I made it for you. Thanks. Won't you eat? I put in a lot of cashew nuts for you. Kishore, doing a job in MNC is not the end. And that too like a robot. Is it important whether the company you work in is big or small? Or is it important to do the job you love? Hmm, tell me. Hmm... atleast tell me now how is the Upma? Are you learning how to cook from YouTube videos? Hey, superb! Fantastic, stupendous, -fantabulous. -Hmm... Why are you using the GRE words on me? [keyboard clicks] God! Your dressing sense has changed. This is what staying in jail overnight has done to you. Hey, are you going to paint in anyone's house? Every guy in India should be jailed for two days. Their minds will be set right. By the way, does jail have Wi-Fi? Hey, go and change your dress. What is this dinner all of a sudden? Their sons from America have come. By the way, uncle's sons are so posh. How should I talk to them? Hey, just like how Indians who don't know English speak to American customers. Yeah, yeah, yeah... You just have to say that. Hey! Both of you behave well without fighting with each other. Okay? Both: Yeah, yeah, yeah... -You! -Why do you always raise your hand? -Come... come on boys. [chuckles] Oh! Wonderful. You guys look better than the other. -Yeah, yeah, yeah... -Yeah, come in. -Hey! -Ah! This is my elder son Harish. In Seattle, he owns a big house with a big lawn. By the way, people call me Harry in the US. You can call me that too. -Hi.. -My second son, Manohar. -Hi! -He is working as a senior manager at IBM. -And he leads a big team there. -Yeah. Hi guys. -So, if Harish is Harry, Manohar is Manny? [laughs] -Good joke. -So, lame. So, aunty, you will be happy for all this month. Yes, Kishore. It's wonderful to see children at home like this. Kishore is planning to go to America just like you. -But he did not get his visa. -Oh, I see. -See if you can help him. -Sure, dad. Hey, Kishore, send your resume. These days it is very tough to get into the US. But I'll take care of it. -Chandu is a game designer, working in... -Gachibowli. Yes, Gachibowli. How is the job scene in India? Are salaries any better or still the same? [chuckles] How much do they pay monthly? Are they still paying ten to twelve thousand? Nothing like that. Err... A fresher gets around twenty to thirty five thousand. Yea! But nothing can beat my ten thousand dollars a month. Right? Well, that's impossible here. Dad, Anjali has new exciting business ideas. She has a startup. -Anjali, why don't you tell them about it. -Sure. -Actually, Indians in the US are so busy. -Yeah! So we prepare idly mix and deliver to their homes for all online orders. We have got a thousand followers on Facebook. It's a big hit you know. -We get around twenty orders monthly. -Yeah, it is fantastic. Great! Dad, do you know that Shweta makes excellent Biryani. Is it? We are thinking about having an online Biryani point. Best Biryani of Hyderabad. We've registered it. I think she'll do good. [chuckles] You embarrass me! Hey, what is that you're doing? It is Biryani. How can you eat it with a knife and fork? You can experience the real taste if you eat it with your fingers. I usually wash my hands and eat. What do you mean? That I eat without washing my hands? [laughing] Tomorrow we are going to a picnic so I bought you a new saree. [indistinctive chatter] [chuckles] -He resembles you a lot. -He is playing very well with you, dad. Rohan, come here. Don't play in the sand. Yuck. -It's okay dear, kids play in the sand. -No, father-in-law, this is very dirty. Shweta, both my sons played in the sand like this. -Once Harish was totally covered in mud. -Harry, why don't you say something. You can tell him. Aye, doesn't he play in sand-pits in the US? Come on Harry, that is US sand and this is Indian soil. It is very different. He'll catch infections. Come, Rohan. Hey, is there so much difference in the sand as well? Don't touch me. Get your hands away from me. Yuck, cooties. Don't touch me. -Go clean your hands. -Come man. [vehicles honking] -Excuse me. -Yes? There used to be an IT company here... maybe it's the wrong address... sorry. -Which company are you looking for? -It's Microinfo. This is Mircoinfo. -Oh! Is this an IT company? -Yes, it's a startup. -Oh! -What are you here for? -Interview. [birds chirping] -Oh! Yeah... go down and take a right. -Thanks. Kishore, I guess you are looking for me. Come. -Kishore... -Yes? You have not done well in your written test. You got very less marks. I'm really not sure if I can give you this job. [sighs] Sir, in India there are a lot of people who simply by heart and get 90 marks. Do you want such engineers? Kishore, though you didn't do well in the written test... but your I am impressed by your software programme. In fact, you've taken a completely different approach. Let me ask you one thing. What exactly are you looking in this job? I want to make products. I want to make a difference to my people, I am good at building gadgets. My passion is electronics. You are definitely different from a conventional engineer. I want to take a chance on you. You are in. Thank you Prakash, I will prove myself. You will not regret this decision. Kishore, we are a start up. We make apps for doctors. I can't give you high pay salary. But I can give a share in the company. Is it okay? -Definitely okay, sir. -Good. When can we start? -Right away. -Great. TV: In Los Angeles in America. Don't stuff it, mom. Dear, why don't you go and see your aunt? She hasn't been keeping well. You know that she even raised you for sometime. You know that right? Yes mom, I want to go. We will go tomorrow. -Hey... -Yeah! -Hello... -Will go tomorrow... -You are back. -Hi. -Hey! -You shopped in entire Hyderabad? You are back. You shopped a lot. A lot mother-in-law. We took some sarees for mother-in-law. -Looks good. How much does this cost? -You like it? -1.2 lakhs. -Oh! -Mom, isn't this beautiful! -Yes, it is. -Hey Shweta, -Yes? I wanted to meet my aunt, shall we go? -Shweta... -God! What is this nonsense. Didn't we decided this before coming to India, right? Not to go to relatives home and waste our time. Do you know, I still have a lot to shop. Don't trouble me by asking me such questions. -Hey, where did you take this? -I took this in Panjagutta shop as well. Is it? They are very beautiful. TV: Yash tried to make room to hit the off-side, Mumbai Indians haven't got to start again. It's got a good batting spot now no. 3. [giggles] What did you do Rohan? Those are my tablets. What's the tumult little one? I will spank you, be careful. Mother-in-law, who are you to scold my son? Doesn't his grandmother have the right to scold him? Father-in-law, only parents have this right in the US. Grandparents can only visit them but have no right to spank or scold them. After all, they are only tablets. You can buy them again. Why should you create so much fuss? Get in Rohan. Hey... She shouldn't have spoken to aunty like that. Should you bother about it? Brother... -Uncle, I am sorry. -It's all right. -Ah! Ah! -Hey, Sunanda... -Aunty. -Sunanda. -Mom! Mom! -Sunanda... -Aunty... -Mom! -Aunty... -Mom! -Mom... -Sunanda... She is absolutely fine. Her BP got high. You don't have to worry. Thank you, doctor. I guess you are only doing all the work at home. Now that your both daughter-in-laws are here, you should take rest. Okay, doctor. From now on, your children will take care of you. What do you say Mr. Rao? Yes, doctor. They are coming back to India from the US in about three months. There is no doubt that they will take good care of us, Your children are gems. You are very lucky Rao garu Any parents can only wish for sons like these. After all, it is your parenting. Successful sons, good daughter-in-laws. By the way, when are you planning to come back to India? -Very soon... -In another one or two months. What is happening? How is father-in-law so sure that we are coming back? What did you tell him? I did not tell him anything, Shweta. I think dad is just imaging. But why should we come back to India? It is so dirty here. So much of pollution and on top of it, these mosquitoes. It is so tough to raise children here. If we stay in India, someone or the other keeps coming. And all my life will be spent in serving tea and coffee to relatives. And what about our privacy? No way. I can't believe that you didn't utter a single word in front of your dad. Then what do you want me to do? That we have applied for American citizenship we will settle there itself and we are not coming back to India? That too when my mom is not well. Brother, my friend faced the same situation. He did not tell anything to his parents. He advised me never to give any kind of commitment... ...when faced with such situations. After some time, parents will understand all by themselves. -Okay, we will do the same... -May be a good option. Uncle, here are your medicines. Thanks, Kishore. I usually don't like to involve in uncle's family matters. But I wonder what happened to me. It is okay. I didn't find it wrong. Did you see how both the sons were simply quiet when she was abusing aunty? Just quiet. No matter how much mom tried to convince me, I never agreed to any NRI marriage alliance. -If they are NRI's, do they change? -Yes, they do change. Hi-Fi jobs, status, new priorities... who knows, tomorrow you might change too. For me, the relationship with my parents, friends should always be the same forever. I don't want any of it to change for me. -It's okay for me. -What? I am done with my ice cream. Give me yours. -Hey, she looks sizzling hot. -She is your sister. -Hey, get lost you idiot! -What are you doing? If they come back it will be a big problem. I am so brave because you're beside me. Okay, but next time, tell me ahead so that I'll be prepared. Super! Will you fight for me? Hello, I will get ready to run away, not fight! -Kishore, I'll... -Hey! Hey! Hey, what do you think of yourself? That you're great? Are you trying to show off? I don't mind because I love you so much. I feel so good when I am around you. You said you didn't like art but loved my paintings. I felt good. You don't say anything about yourself but ever ready to help everyone around. On the whole, you see me as what I am... [birds chirping] [sighs] Kishore, will you love me if I say that I love you? What will you say? Tell me. I know you won't say anything. Because you are crazy about going to America. Anita, that is... Though Anita was brave enough to confess her love, I could not answer her. What should I tell her? I had too many things going on in my life and I was not sure of anything. Not even my own feelings. Shweta, come back soon. -Yes bro, I've already checked in. -Yeah! We will arrange for Rohan's admission into a good school here. Okay mother-in-law. Mother-in-law, take your tablets regularly. We will worry if your health is not stable. -Take care mother-in-law. -Okay. Alright, take care mom. See you, dad. -Mom, take care of your health. -Hmm... Take care. Bye dad. Anand Rao was always proud of his sons, but that day he wasn't. He felt the emotional vacuum. Some sort of sadness. -Kishore, you wanted to show me something? -Yes, Prakash. I made a prototype for ultrasound machine. I wanted to show it to you. So basically I am trying to reduce it's cost. [music mutes voices] -I think we're ready for investors. -Yeah, thanks Prakash. Good job. Guys, please present your business idea. Currently hospitals use this diagnostics system to test pregnant women. With this equipment, we can assess the health of the unborn baby in the womb. And these are very expensive. Costs around 15 to 20 lakhs. Only super speciality hospitals in metros can afford these. And they are all imported. Now I invite Mr. Kishore to present our new product... for which we are seeking investments. -Kishore... -Thank you Prakash. This is a portable ultrasound scanner... which we developed using 3D printing technology. Completely made in India and this is priced only at fifty thousand rupees. Now, we can keep a machine in every town... ...and village, in every primary healthcare centre. And we can test every pregnant women using this machine. And this is backed by viable and scalable business model. See, this is the problem with new generation. Guys, why do you want to create something new? You should leave the creating part to Europe or the US. In India we should go online. Why don't you consider online trading? Take a successful website from the US and replicate it here. Come up with something original. [scoffs] Original? We shout slogans 'Make in India, Make in India'. If we sell foreign products online in India, how can it be 'Make in India'? That will not be 'Make in India', but it will be 'Make up India'. That is why everyone in India are traders and not creators. Everything is imported, from the diaper a baby wears to the Gillette blade. My laptop, my watch, my TV and shoes... not only that... even the God in my shrine to the kites we fly are all made in China. Even the mosquito bats sold at traffic signals are also imported. If you don't invest in product companies, when will Indian brands come up? When can we create global brands? When will India develop, sir? Some lakhs of engineers are working in software companies. But none of them create a new product. Because we lend our services to hundreds of companies in America. Abdul Kalam was right, we are all 'Software Coolies'. Oh! Really? Are you trying to teach us? We've studied in IIT and IIM. Do you know much more than what we do? Guys, I think we are done here. Let's leave. You have done a good job. Relax. Hi, I am Mohan. I am an industrialist and an angel investor. I've been really looking for passionate people with a good product. I believe I found the right team and keen on investing in your company. I will invest in your company. -Thank you so much. -Prakash and Kishore, -we will build a global brand from India. -Thank you sir... -What do you say? -Sure, sure sir. Why not! All the best! By the way I never went to IIT or IIM but still built a world class company. Bye. -Congrats! [laughs] -Thanks to you. -Let's do it. Where is Kishore? It's been three days. He is not taking my calls or checking my WhatsApp messages. Oh goddess! Even we haven't seen him. We are worried that we are not able to drink. And this is the first time that he is working. I wonder what will happen to this country. [sighs] I'll not spare him today. -What he is thinking about himself. -Mr. Rao, can you please handle that? -Hey. -Hey! Hi. What do you think about yourself? You don't take my calls or don't even reply to my messages in WhatsApp. Look at how your behaving. Oh! You are ignoring me because I like you, isn't it? Come on, it is not like that. Come with me. Leave me. Come with me, please. -Where are you taking me? -I will show you something. -Morning sir. -Morning. This is an Ultrasound machine that'll help pregnant women living in rural areas. I made this. -Huh? -Hmm... Happy? TV: If you work hard, anything is possible in life. And Kishore from Siddipet is a quintessence for the same. This is an ultrasound scanner designed with low cost. His success has become the trending topic in the two Telugu states. The cost of an Ultrasound CT scanner used for pregnant women costs around 50 lakhs. But this scanner designed by Kishore is... -only fifty thousand rupees. -I am happy to announce. Our company... ...has been acquired by a big American company for 20 Million dollars! -Wow! Super! [applause] You are a rich man, now. Do you know the value of your shares? -It is more than a crore! -Really? Are you serious? Congratulations, uncle! Our Kishore is super. But he did not get his visa for US. You are all happily settled in the America. What are you talking, uncle. What Kishore has achieved in commendable. The jobs we have been doing in America since ten years are routine jobs. -It is the same work, no change. -Here, take some tea. Success is not defined by living in the US. Look at how Kishore invented something great. That is achievement. Back in America we are sharing his achievement on Facebook and WhatsApp. And boast that he is our cousin. Narayana, if your son has achieved so much here, why does he need to go to America? If he can do a lot here, imagine what he can do in America. In another six months, he will get a visa and fly to America. Sunanda... Dear, look how good this school is. And it is near to our house. It will be so good if Rohan studied in this school. Huh, Sunanda... What is it? Nothing... [chuckles] By the way professor, you were supposed to go to US this month. It's been six months. When are you going? I am not going, sir. I don't have to because my visa renewal has been rejected. Rejected, but how? What is there to hide with you, sir? I became a little selfish. I purposefully made a mistake on the visa form. That's it, rejected. Now my children won't call me. I don't have to be a baby sitter, I don't have to cringe watching those Telugu serials all day. What else can you do? Just spending six months amidst the four walls. We can't go out or speak to anyone. Neither do we know those rules. We have to put the trash can out on Monday. If not we'll get verbally abused by son and daughter-in-law. Should take care of laundry. If our grandchildrens trouble us, we are not allowed to say anything to them and just feel sacred. I can't do this anymore, sir. But why should we do this service at this age, Mr. Rao? [birds chirping] -I can't do this. From now, I will stay here only. Happy and comfortable life. Rangadu and Saiamma will take care of the house. Mr. Rao, what happened? -Can I ask you something? -Yeah! Where did you do the mistake in the visa form? Because our visa is nearing renewal. I want it to get rejected. I don't want to go to America either. I will tell you. [knocks on door] [door opens] -Hi. -Hi... What brings you here? Shouldn't I come? [chuckles] -It's not like that. Even though we are neighbours you never came to our house, so... I came to see your paintings. Oh! Come. Umm... -Greetings. -Greetings. He has come to see the paintings I made for the art show. -Oh! -Oh! -Is it. -Come. [door opens creaks] -Hello, madam. [gasps] [chuckles] Wow! I am done. So? Tell me now... -Why did you come? -I... really like your room. I mean... I like your world. -Anita, I wanted to tell you something. -Hmm? I... -I... [phone rings] Hello... Okay, I am coming, -Anita, one second... -Hey, Kish... [sighs] -Shucks! [siren wailing] [life support machine beeps] [life support machine beeps] Doctor... It was a heart attack. But now he is fine. You got him in at the right time. You can see him after an hour. Thank you doctor, thank you. -Thank you doctor. -It's okay. Mom, get the best treatment for dad. It doesn't matter how many dollars! Why did it take so long to reach to the hospital? Give me the ambulance phone number. Shweta will call and raise a complaint. Mom, if it's in the US, you can reach the hospital in ten minutes. Mom, send me dad's reports in WhatsApp. Anjali will check on the internet and send suggestions to the doctor. Okay, I will call you once your father is awake. Okay uncle, we shall take leave. Okay, bye uncle. -Take care uncle. -Take care uncle. [voice muted] Children are not coming, right? It seems, they have some important work. Otherwise they would have definitely come. They would have come. Our children have good jobs, they are well settled in America. As parents of such successful kids, we should be very happy. Then why are we unhappy, Sunanda? [sobbing] Dear... Don't cry... Don't worry son, Mr. Anand is fine. He will be discharged soon. There's nothing to be tensed about. But I am tensed, doctor. The Wi-Fi in the hospital is not working. I've to upload these photos on Instagram and Facebook urgently. How should I do it? What is wrong with you, always clung to the phone? Come now. [vehicles honking] Kishore has been a great help to us. Yes, indeed. Imagine our situation without him. [door opens creaks] -Hi... Greetings uncle. -Greetings. -Uncle is watching something. -Son, uncle never misses this serial. -Hey! Because the heroine of this serial is uncle's favourite. Oh! [laughs] -I feel that... the hero looks exactly like our uncle. [laughs] Stop it... -Uncle, one selfie. [camera captures] [infant crying] -Huh? -Shh... -TV: Narsimha, she is escaping catch her. -Hey... -Then why am I here for? [chuckles] -Come... -Come with me, I'll tell you. -Hey, where to? -Anita where are you taking me? -Wait... Hey... Bro, room 132 has some emergency, the nurse is calling you. Go, quick. Go, quick... -Hey, where are you sending him? -Shh... Oh my, I won't come with you. I am leaving... Hey, come with me, nothing will happen. Come with me. -Where are we going? -Shh... -Come. [door opens creaks] What are doing? -And where are you taking me? -Come, I will tell you. -Hey, wait. [laughs] You are like a little monkey. -With you, I am sure life is an adventure. [laughs] Thanks! So, tell me. Chocolate is yummy. Else, why are you asking me to tell something when it's you who got me here! Okay... There is this guy in my college, Rahul. He is so handsome, just like Vijay Devarakonda. He likes me so much. And he keeps giving me gifts, roses, cards and all. So what? He proposed to me last week. Oh! So I am thinking should I accept his proposal or not? What do you say? Should I accept him? Tell me. Reject him Anita. Go and say no to Rahul. What should I answer him if he asks me the reason? Tell him that there is already someone in your life. Tell him, 'I am his life'. Tell him, 'He is crazy for me'. Tell him, 'He adores me'. Tell him, 'He loves my paintings and my drama'. Tell him, 'He feels proud of me'. 'He loves my eyes, my nose...' 'and my lips the most', tell him that. Should I tell him that when he kisses me the entire world stops? Bro, sorry it is not room number 132, emergency in room 142. She was wrong. Seriously, it is urgent it seems. Please go. God! They are troubling me. -Hey, why are you taking those keys? -Hey! -What are you doing? [laughing] Hey, Rudrammadevi wait, I'll teach you a lesson. [laughing] Hey! [phone rings] [laughs] Hello, Prakash... Congratulations! Pack your bags, kiddo! Finally you're going to US, next week. You got your green card. Are you serious? I can't believe this! How it happened this early? Actually, when our company was in the process of acquisition, they wanted you desperately. But I didn't tell you this. Because I wanted to make sure it happens this time. But how did I get a green card so quickly, Prakash? This is given to extraordinary people in the EB1 category in a fast track process. This is given only to scientist and top engineers. Kishore, America thinks you are someone very special. Thank you Prakash, thank you! Who was on the call? It is my boss from the office. He said there is some urgent work to be done. Hmm... I should go and prepare for my art show, bye. That day, looking at how happy she was, I couldn't reveal about my green card to Anita. Doctor! Doctor! Hey, what happened? Son... -What happened aunty? -Uncle. -Uncle! -Doctor! -Uncle. -Doctor, come please check him. Husband. -Sorry. [gasps] [sobs] -Husband. Shweta, we have to go to India urgently. I am booking the tickets right away. God, there are no tickets available at such short notice. Tickets are available only after a day and that too very expensive. We already have a lot of expenditure because of our mortgage payments. Think for a while. Harry, I will take care of Rohan. Why don't you go alone? Anyways you will reach after two days, in which case you can't even see the body. Shweta... I mean you can't even see father-in-law. So... there is no point going there now. But if you go by the tenth day, you can spend some time with your mother. And I am sure there are a lot of relatives to pacify her now. So there is no use going now. "Is this the curse of providing you with good education," "Come, my son" What did you decide Manohar? Anjali, I have an important project delivery. It is hard to get leave now. But I have to go. Please, pack the bags. I know this is a very emotional issue. But there is a risk to your job. We can't be so impractical. It is not a simple decision to go there, Manohar. By the way, it's your brother's duty to perform the last rites. When he is not going, what is the point of you going there? Mom, by the time I come, the funeral will be done. I don't know what to do. Mother-in-law, don't worry, he will be there for the tenth day for sure. "Do you understand the excruciating pain a mother goes through?" -It's okay. Come, when you want to. -"You'd get a chance to see him" "Is it the punishment for raising you?" -My dear, we have dedicated our lives to the best of our children. I left my job because our elder son had asthma. I remained a housewife. We sent our second son to the USA by selling our house. You always told me that our kids are our priority. But I am unable to understand where we went wrong as parents. I am unable to understand... [sobbing] -I am unable to understand... "In the fire of pyre, I turn into the raging flames too," "Can't you come, my son?" "In the middle of the night," "I called you my son" "Couldn't you hear me, my son?" "You have gone too far from the shadow of those who gave birth to you" "What's the use to live?" It seems that Mr. Anand Rao's children are not coming. It is our generation who sends them there. It is not in our hands when they'd come back. First, they start troubling us saying they 'want a student visa'. After completing studies they get into a job and ask that they need an H1 visa. And to change a job easily they say, they need a Green Card. And if we ask them to at least come now, they say that if they come back with... the Green Card visa, it may get cancelled. They say that they'll come after they get citizenship. Mean while their children grew up and the kids are not interested to come back to India, so we'll also stay there. Bro, going to the US is a one way ticket. There is no return ticket. That's about it! "You thumped my chest while playing as a baby," "is this the curse of providing you with clothes, food, and schooling." "Come, my son..." "Come, my son" Hey... life is so unpredictable. What all I did to go to the US. Nothing worked out for me. Shucks! And when I was about to give up is when things started to fall in place. [scoffs] Nothing happens according to us. Hey, everything happens according to one's will. Now you will go to Florida and we will come to see you in Florida. When you come to the airport to pick us up, get two girls in bikini in your BMW. We will start the party right from the airport. Hey, shut up you 'Ding dong bell'. Kishore you gave great speech about... 'Make in India' in front of those investors. You invented something useful for everyone. You're in love with a girl. And when you got the Green Card now you want to fly away to America? Do you think this is correct? I don't know. I've never seen my dad look so happy because of me. But, when my dad is so happy... whichever reason has made him happy, may be I think that is only correct. Here Pavan, take this sweet. My son is going to America. [laughs] -How are you? -I am good, mom. -Come, sit. -Thanks uncle. -I wonder when you guys will go! -Ah! I've never seen your father look so happy. He called everyone and told them that your flying to America. Why not! After a long time, my son is going to America. And that too not on any visa, but directly with a green card. My mom and dad are happy. But I haven't said anything about my Green Card to Anita. That's one thing left to be done. [bike engine revs] [birds chirping] Why did are you here? Anita, I got a US Green Card visa, I wanted to tell you that. I know, congrats! So when are you leaving for the US? Day after tomorrow. -What, day after tomorrow? -Yes. Sorry, I wanted to tell you before but everything happened so quick. Okay. You are telling me now, so problem solved! Problem solved? Finally I am going to the US. But I am not happy Anita. Do you know why? Because you are not with me. Anita, listen to me. I am not able to rejoice this without you. Anita, that is... I love you... You don't want to speak anything? I am talking to you. Will you not say anything? Yes, I want to say... Listen... You may love me, but I don't love you. I don't love you at all. I don't like you. What we did that day on the hospital terrace... we both together... it's nothing for you, right? Oh! That... I was confused. Uncle's heart attack, a sleepless night and my mind wasn't working. Don't tell me all this. You love me. I know you like me. You do love me, Anita. Okay, maybe I love you, maybe I don't. Whether I love you or not is irrelevant, Kishore. Because there in no future where we can live together. Our ways are different. What different Anita? Why don't you come with me to US? I will take care of you. You can do an art course there. There are very good art college there in the US. If there is love everything is possible, Anita. I promise you, I'll take good care of you forever. What is your problem? How did you even think that I'll come to the US with you? You are crazy about going to the US. You don't even know what you want to do after going there. Did you ever think about it? No, you just adamant to go to the US. Kishore, going to the US is your dream, not our dream. My life is here, my place is this and my struggles are here! I am the only daughter for my parents. I cannot leave them and come with you. I just not interested to go to America or Nagpur. You imagined me in your future plans. Anita, it's not like that. Kishore, just understand that love alone cannot suffice a relationship. Now and then, sacrifices are necessary. But none of us are ready to do such sacrifices [sighs] Sorry, Kishore. There is absolutely no scope of us living together. You go, go and peruse your dreams. Good Luck! I am letting go of our friendship. [crying] "Dear, the distance..." "is a burden on me" "This silence..." "the second when I leave you" "Ruining the relations..." "...time casts its spell" "Like the setting sun..." "I can't leave you" "Dear, the distance..." "is a burden on me" "The language my heart speaks..." "You couldn't understand it" "When your looks show anger on me..." "I couldn't take it" "The sorrow deep in heart..." "I want to get rid of it" "The dark could in my eyes..." "Let it not rain" Yeah, brother-in-law? Yeah, we are starting for the airport. You should have to recieve Kishore in New York airport. Okay? Hey, come on... don't I know that? We have packed his bag with sweaters and jackets everthing. Yes, brother-in-law I am very happy. You should have to take care of him. It's your responsibility. Come on, your game is over here. Your father is setting you a good life there. Aunty... Come son. Aunty, I am leaving. [sobbing] -"The wound that doesn't pain" -You are leaving too, son? "doesn't have a cure" "Without a destination..." "my journey can't continue" What is this? Why are you wearing his coat like a young boy? Doesn't it look good? -Remove it... -Okay. -Remove the coat as well. -I am taking it off, wait. [chuckles] Hey, where is Anita? She has gone to the art show. Here... is your passport safe with you? -Hmm... -Take care of the dollars. -Alright. -You have your ticket, right? -Yeah, I have kept everything. -Is everything packed? -I've packed everything come. -Kishore. Yes, aunty? Uncle had written this letter for you. Dear Kishore, I have done a grave mistake in my life. I sent my sons to America. I was very proud that they were in good jobs there. I thought I was a successful father. But at the end of it, I lost my sons. We became childless. I am not a successful father, I am a failed father. I told them how to go to America but did not teach them how to come back. Who is a successful parent? Being with children when they grew up, one who spends his old age with playing with grandchildren... is the a successful parent. Not me. When young, children are our responsibility. But as we grow older, we become their responsibility. This is a very simple family value. It's been passing down from generations that I could not teach my sons. It is not about sending money... and making phone calls while staying away in another country. That is not taking care of parents. I did not realize this. For all the time you spent with us was beautiful. I wish that your parents don't go through the same ordeal. Your uncle. Dad, you're happy that I am going to America? Son, aren't you happy? No, dad. What is this son? Your dreams are finally coming true now. No dad, it is not my dream. How can you say that? You always wanted to go to America since childhood. All these are something that I learned from you. You felt very proud of watching all the cousins who came from America. And I thought I should make you feel proud of me too. The dreams where I wanted to see you happy are actually not mine, dad. It's your dreams. What are my wishes when I was young? To win in the marble games... Whether or not I will be the first one to bat such are my wishes. I didn't know where Delhi was, what would I know about America, dad? I did all this because you will be happy if you go to US. No, dad... I've realized, that I cannot go to America to earn dollars, coming once in three years. I cannot live away from you. You don't understand it now. But when you are old, you'll need me. I wonder if you can call me back. And even wonder if I can come to you. I am not sure. If I am with you, I'll be very happy. I can achieve anything. I don't want to go to America. -I won't go to America. -Good, my son. -It's alright, you stay with us. [sobbing] -Don't cry. -Son... [laughs] [laughs] Hey ding dong bell, didn't I tell you he won't go? -Okay. -Take the luggage out. At least shave your beard now, I can't bear to see you like this anymore. Hey, talk less. Go get the vehicle, we have to go to the art exhibition. Fast! One minute. I'll be back. Hey, you're Anita, right? So what is this painting about? It is the story of a young sailor. He has no clue of his destination. And this is the reason he is stuck in a thunderstorm. So, did he reach the shore? No, I don't think so. I believe he is lost forever The idiot has lost his way. Will he be stuck forever in that storm? Someday or the other he will realize what he wants in his life. What happened? You're back? Oh! I missed my flight. So, when is your next flight? I don't know. At least not in this life. I am planning to try in my next life. Friends? Yeah! [laughs] It was A for America, and now it is A for Anita? -Hey! [chuckles] [music mutes voices] Anita... She is beautiful dude. Hey, what? Don't try to fool me. -Wow! -Yeah! -Congractulations dude. [laughs] He is lucky enough. Come on. I had to practice tonight, if I had that book. Hello, Rukma sister. Nothing son, my younger daughter like guava very much. I'll give some will you take with you when you go to America? I am not going to America. -What, aren't you going? -I won't go eighter. I wanted to stay with my parents here itself. "Hey, what happened Kishore?" "You'll become a fool if you go to America and we're worried" "Why do you want to get into that trouble?" "Don't go behind dollars you jackass, stop your nonsense" "You'll lose everything you have for sure" "You neither get toddy there, nor the spicy sprouts to much along" "You don't get snacks for munching, you don't get peace at all" "You'll come back once in 4 years. You go to shopping as you wake up" "You'll become selfish, and won't stay with your people" "You'll become a fool if you go to America and I am worried" "Why do you want to get into that trouble?" "This is the song of Rahul Sipligunj, baby!" "Wow!" "Hey, what happened Kishore?" "There is no spot for drinking tea" "You don't find people to chat with" "There will be no Potharaju to dance for Bonalu festival" "There you won't find any lane to place the Ganesh's statue" "There would be no festivals, there wouldn't be any friend fit for us" "They wait for Green Card, if they won't get it they live like a thief" "They take stored curries and eat however they are" "They sit in the washroom and clean the rear with a tissue paper" "You'll become a fool if you go to America, oh my dude!" "You're an outsider there forever" "Don't go behind dollars you jackass, stop your nonsense" "You'll lose everything you have for sure" [humming] "Hey, how much will you kick? Now sing the rap." "Listen now!" "Microsoft is here itself, if you go to the next street there is Facebook" "If you see ahead there is Google, if you turn behind there is McDonald's" "If you see before you, there's Subway, there's Starbucks for tea or coffee" "If you see up there is the owner's mother" "If you want to go shopping there's the Amezone too" [laughs] -"It's not Amezone, stupid." "It's Amazon" "There's no mother there to serve food" "Our father wouldn't be there to watch our backs" "There wouldn't be our own sister to tie Rakhi" "There wouldn't be our brother-in-law to have drinks" "They greet us and eat our food" "They back stab us ultimately" "No one would cook your food. No one would wash your clothes" "No one would wash your dishes and no one would be there to comfort you" "You'll become a fool if you go to America and I am worried" "The people settled there are rushing back here" "Don't go behind dollars you jackass, stop your nonsense" "You'll lose everything you have for sure"
