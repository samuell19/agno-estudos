My name is Jiu-Bing. I'm a pacer. A pacer needs to lead in a marathon, helping runners to time their breath and pace. They would run close together. Are you all right? Until the moment they reach the last 12 km. The pacer then needs to slow down. Let the runner sprints to the finishing line. Keep going. A pacer has no finishing line to pursue, just keeps showing endless support. What's wrong? I don't want to run today. You don't? Then why do you book my class? It would be less lonely going together. Jiu-Bing. Why do you want to be a pacer? Hey, wait for me. I'm not on the bus yet. This kid running after the bus is me in childhood. I was a loner in my class. No classmates remembered my name for two years. The teacher barely noticed my presence either. You can run pretty well. Go sit in the back. May I sit next to you? Why are you talking like this? Shit on your face. My mom said I couldn't talk when I was little. The foreign movies taught me how to talk. Oh, I see. She's Bo-He Liang. Bo-He is the kind of girl that can become the class leader everywhere she goes. She'd be in every speech contest for our school and was the dreamboat of every boy in the class. No doubt, she is a goddess in my heart. You hear that? This is the sound of a T-Rex. Ok, let's take a walk and have a look. The whole size of a T-Rex. How much do you think it weighs? Six tons. Good, we can see on your left... At that time, I didn't know where I was going. I just couldn't take my eyes off her. So... I kept following her. Say bye to daddy. Daddy is going to work now. He's making money to support the family with his hard work. He wants to see you off to work. See daddy goes to work. Bye. You're a motherless girl. Why should the boy like you? What for... Go away... Ever since that moment, I swore to myself. I'd protect this girl for the rest of my life. Never let anyone bully her. Seaweed, seaweed, I'm seaweed. Because of her, I have to get into this college. It's hard to find people like you nowadays,. With such sincerity. I'm so touched. Bo-He. I made it. Jiu-Bing Zhao. Congratulations. Look. Jiu-Bing. How is it? Is it cool? I added some ice. Bo-He. Are you thirsty? - It's raining. - You want to trick me? It's raining. Happy birthday. What are you doing? Hey, what are you up to? That note is mine. Why did you help me? I know you're not a cheater. Everyone ready? Ready. Louder. Everyone ready? Ready. One, two, three. Mid-term exam on October 20th. November. Nothing much. December, Christmas ball. Christmas ball! What should I wear? What are you getting me? The general education class tomorrow is 8:00. Need to get up around 7:00. Finish breakfast by 7:30 and be in the classroom at 7:50 on time. I'm telling you. The professor would flunk you if you're late for three times. It took me forever to register for that class. So you can never never never be late. - You hear? - Got it. Good. I'm going. Bye. Jiu-Bing. Remember to take your shower. Hi there. - What the hell - Freshman? Yes. Don't just lurk there without a word. Let me introduce myself. I'm A-Jie. He's Chui-Ji. I told you to call me by my full name. Feng-Ji Chui. Ha... Feng-Ji Chui. I'm Jiu-Bing. Jiu-Bing. Your family owns a bakery? Don't pry into other's personal info. Come have some hot pot. Wow. You can cook this in the dorm? Ya, close the door. No one would notice if the door is closed. You can do whatever you want. You're not picky about food, right? - Not at all - Everything's fine? Well, you're really lucky. Right on time for some treats. There's no meat. Hey, Chui-Ji. What's he doing? Right, you're new here. Let me explain it to you. He's from the department of biochemical science. He would often bring used lab rats and cook them in the hot pot. You know, look at this. The rat tail, sashimi. Tt's so tender and tasty. It's burning. It's burning. What? What's the fuss? Hi everyone. I'm the teaching assistant An-Yu. The professor will be here soon. I'll do a roll call first. - Bo-He Liang. - Here. Ying-Fa Hong. Here. Whose phone is that? Bo-He. What are you doing? What's wrong? You went through an explosion? How did you know? I have no place to stay. The dorm kicked me out. Try to be polite. See if he can lower the price. You can do all the talking. Why should I? It's you renting the place. What are you doing? Go. It's so small. Hey, what do you think? You want it? Hey, you look like a mess. Try to give the landlord a good impression. What you want? Hey, over here, what you want? - Rent... Is the apartment for rent? - No. - Miss, you're looking for places to rent? - No no. This is a nice place, really. - No, thanks - Come have a look. - Come have a look - We're fine, thanks. We're not renting it. Help. Hurry, hurry. We don't know how to speak Taiwanese. Hey, hurry. That landlord was really terrifying. Yeah, so which apartment do you prefer? None of it. House for rent. Visually feels like 700 square feet. Master, you have places for rent? No we don't. Yes, you do. What? No. Probably someone did a prank. You really don't have places for rent? - No - Yes. Welcome. Hi sis, you're looking for places for rent? Yep. - What are you doing? - It's none of your business. You told me to earn my keep. Over here. - Easy easy - Wait for me. We're really close to schools with beautiful designs and solid construction and steel structure. This weird girl is Tian Xia. She runs the Zao-Dao pastry shop with her dad. Although the shop sells pastries, the customers seem more interested in Tian Xia. Table 7, table 4. I'm so tired. Are you selling pastries or your daughter? Well, you don't get it. This is called integrated marketing. Food and entertainment can make them happy. Besides, I'm here, they won't cause any trouble. If mom knew you're doing this, she would never agree with it. If your mom is still here, she would've backed me up. If you keep doing business like this, when I'm not around anymore, what would you do? You're not around? Where would you go? Someday I'll leave home for college. - No way. - Why not? I don't care. I won't let you leave this house. If you really want to leave home for college, you need to pay for your own education. I can pay it myself, what's the big deal. No matter what I choose to do, don't you try to stop me. - I don't agree with it. - Why? Have you considered my feelings? - Don't talk like me. - I'm not. You want me to live with a girl? Are you ok with that? Or what else? This is the cheapest option. Or you want to live with me? I can do that. It's just the two of you. Not a chance. You're letting a guy to stay with you. What are you thinking? I'll move out one day anyway. Having girls or guys as roommates, I can try to get used to it now. Wouldn't it be great? I don't agree. I don't want to be so far away from you. If something happened in school, how am I going to take care of you? Jiu-Bing, I've been taking care of you growing up. I taught you how to study. If you failed to do so, I had to cheat for you. Forgot your text book, I'd shared it with you. Even I helped you with the college interview. Get you up in the morning for school. When you don't have enough for lunch, I'd shared mine with you. And the craziest thing is, you put me down as your emergency contact. Am I your mother or your wife? Look at him, such a safe herbivore man. Don't worry. You think he's going to make a move on me? You have no idea. Men are just the worst. I'm not. Why would he live here when he has a girlfriend? That's really low. - I'm not his girlfriend. - You're not? Huh? Hello. Jian Xia. I'm not. My last name is Xia. Jian with a J. Hi, Mr. Xia. And you are... I'm Jiu-Bing. Jiu-Bing. Xia's Zao Dao Pastry Shop first established in 1940. There were lot of martial arts professionals when they engaged in combat, they liked to hold our pastries and fought with them for the wins. This is the pastry that the first founder created for the battles. It is called Jiu-Bing. As one of our ancestors once said, let me ask you. Can you break open. The pastry that I'm holding? Is your dad often acting like this? Today, I don't want to know him. But I'm not renting the place. Why go through all the trouble? Jiu-Bing, I'm tired of looking for houses with you all day. If you don't want to rent this place, I'm leaving for the freshmen welcome party. Bye. I thought you said you're not going. That's just an excuse for them to pick up girls. Or maybe I'll go with you. You tag-along. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the spooky test of courage. Eighteen years ago, a pretty girl in our department, fell in love with another guy in our department. He was cheating on her with another girl. It's so hot and steamy. Oops, she caught them on bed together. This girl ran to this old building in rage and put a noose around her neck and hang herself. Since then, if a couple come to this old building, her ghost will break them apart brutally, break them apart, clench your fists, hold your hearts, Clench. The test of courage starts now. Stop screaming. Ok, sorry. It's fine. Nothing here. Hey, wait. Try to stay close to me later. Hey, don't grab me so tight. You see that? I didn't. Don't be scared. I'm a senior student in department of physics. I'm Mai-Zi. Shit on your face. - I got spooked - Don't be scared. So cute. Bye. You said you'll protect me and you just pushed me away. Wait for me. I didn't mean it. My luggage. Are you all right? No. You... Get out... Dad. Look at him all depressed. If he go and commit suicide, will you be able to live with that? Jiu-Bing. What's the matter? I just gave my whole world to someone else. Huh? What do you mean? I made a wrong move. But I didn't realize. I pushed her away to someone else. I already said I'll protect her. I'm such a useless guy. I kinda know how you feel. I got someone that I promised to protect, but Ai-Xing would never come back. Ai-Xing? That's my mom. I'll get going then. Hey, wait up. Jiu-Bing. Where are you going? I don't know. Wherever I can go. Ok. Never mind. You can stay here first until you find a new place to stay. Thank you, Mr. Xia. Five thousand dollars. How's your lunch everyone? Time for the listeners' song requests. I'm a major in industrial engineering, so-called the tool guy, club leader Xu-Xu. And our first request today is Maria from the soil sciences department…. Hi, Bo-He. You look a bit different today. Do I? Not at all. Are you here for lunch? Or are we here to sing? Sorry about that yesterday. I didn't mean to let go. I'm not mad. You're totally mad. How long are you going to act like this? Why would I be mad? I wouldn't dare to be mad at you. Then come looking for houses with me today. That senior student is here. Go. Hi. I heard about it from Bo-He yesterday. What's that? Mai-Zi. You know Mai-zi too? Of course, who doesn't? He's a top senior student in physics department, a possible future Nobel prize winner. You want to go after him? It's none of your business. Huh. Mai-Zi. She's just mad at you. Is it? Have you slept together? She'd stay with me when her dad's on a trip. We'd share a room but nothing happened. Then that's your bad. She's there with you but nothing happened. You want her to take the initiative? We have a pure friendship. You've been a virgin for so long, no wonder she doesn't want you. You sound like you know what you're saying. You know what they call me. Can opener in north Hsin-Chu. That's your fault. She said she love you personally? No. Then did you say you love her? No. Then the hypothesis is failed to be proved. The experiment is a complete fail. What am I supposed to do? Ask her if she loves you The best way to get the proof. Case closed. - What's up? - It works. I suppose. I call it the devil's tear. Drink it and it'll take you to another world... Hey look, what's he doing? Bo-He. - Bo-He. - Stop chasing me. - Bo-He. - Stay away. Bo-He. Go away. Fuck. Jiu-Bing Zhao. What the hell are you doing? Bombing the dorm is one thing. Now you're a pervert in campus, and even assaulted the police. What have I done? You have no idea what you've done? Ok, it's all right. I really don't know. It's lucky that Mai-zi would help out and the officer is willing to forgive you. Otherwise, you'll have a crime record. It's fine, Bo-He. I think he just drank too much. At least he didn't get hurt. Can you make your way back? Should I drive you back on the way... - Sure - No need. Let him take a walk and sober up. And don't follow me later. Maybe Mai-Zi can get you home first. It would be safer. Jiu-Bing. You're in college, please grow up. I don't want to keep worrying about you and your emergency contact. Stop using my phone number. Ok, I think he got the idea. He won't be doing that again. Well, we'll get going. Come on. Thank you officer. Take care. That's your girlfriend? She's tough. Just like my wife. She's all right. You're off the hook. Thank you sir. Young man. You got some nice moves. Don't get so mad. Just talk it out with your boyfriend. I'm not mad and he's not my boyfriend. I thought you guys are very close. I thought we would be together too, but we didn't. But now I realized... I want to be protected sometimes. Be taken care of. Just ocassionally. I can't be the only one growing up and he's still that boy all the time. What are you doing at school today? Bo-He. The girl I saw last time? I saw she got mad at you and left with another guy. So what? She scolded you like that and you still like her? I would still like her if she beats me. There is only one Bo-He in the world. If a guy cares too much about a woman, he would often become very pessimistic. Such symptom can be called as love you too much syndrome. What are you talking about? There's no such disease. You should tell her if you like her or how would she know? If you keep it to yourself, she would keep playing dumb. I don't know how you two get along. How do I tell her something like this? Loud and clear. I got a plan for you to confess your love. We'll be standing by at the stairwell. Jiu-Bing then arrives like a hero on top, confessing his love to all the people. Bo-He, the first time I saw you at the age of ten. I'm deeply attracted to you. All these years, my eyes have always been on you. I really like you. I will take good care of you. Better than now. Bo-He Liang, will you be my girlfriend? I like you. Jiu-Bing. Jiu-Bing. Bo-He, sorry, I was afraid. If I don't do it soon... Jiu-Bing. Are you ready? - I'm ready. - Ready. Go for it. Don't be scared. Go! Bo-He, the first time I saw you at the age of ten. I want to tell you. I will take. I will take good care of you. Better than... Better than now. Look at this form, about the mass media and we-media. This is an important form. My eyes have always been on you. Liang, Bo... Wow, that's my lab. Hey Chui-Ji. No. I can't hold on to it anymore. Help. Bo-He. Jiu-Bing. It's too high. - Help Jiu-Bing - I like you, Bo-He Liang. Help Jiu-Bing. My eyes have always been on you. I like you so freaking much. - I hope you can be my girlfriend - Where is this going? What do you say? I... Wow? I love you. Why is this happening? It's flying away. Jiu-Bing. Bo-He has no class today, she went out with Mai-Zi! This is a great view. Confessing your love here feels pretty good. What's the point if no one's listening. I think the whole point of it is telling your true feelings. Being heard or not, being accepted or not is nothing we can decide. Zao Dao Pastry Shop will make a fortune. Are you an idiot? It's not a wishing well. It feels good to scream it out. Your turn. Hurry. Your turn, Jiu-Bing. - Your turn. - Stop it. Come on, hurry up. Jiu-Bing, it's your turn. - Tian Xia. - Go go. - Knock it off, Tian Xia. - Go, Jiu-Bing. - Knock it off. - Go, Jiu-Bing. Shit on your face. See, it feels good. It's all right. But that's really gross. What's that all about? That's me cursing. Bo-He would stop me from saying it. She feels gross. Jiu-Bing, get up. Follow my moves. - Come on. - No. One. Two. Three. Start moving or I'll double the rent. One, two, three, four. Big cat, big cat I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger Tiger in the front, tiger in the front Tiger in the rear, tiger in the rear Butt is gonna get chewed up. - Gonna get chewed up - Now Move. Now shake. I don't care, I got it, it's mine. Then shoot the ball. You want some mai-tea, Jiu-Bing? He's allergic to the word "Mai". Don't mess with him. Why would you serve the pastries so far away? Is that so? Yes. That's really inconvenient. Table 4. Welcome. A table for three? Zao Dao Pastry Shop. We're from Civil Aeronautics Administration. Your promotional balloon is unauthorized. Sending it away casually is causing serious hazard to the air traffic. CAA will be fining you for 1.2 million dollars. What balloon, there must be a misunderstanding. Help. Let me down. Where am I? Did anyone see me? How's your lunch, everyone? Yes, time for the listeners' song requests. I'm a major in drama and theatre arts, another tool guy, club leader Da-Da. Yeah, right. So many freshman girls write us today, accusing the senior student Mai-Zi, secretly having a girlfriend. This breaking news is causing girls in the campus... What's wrong? Come on. Hi, Jiu-Bing. - Hi. - Hello. You're having lunch? Yeah. This is Mai-Zi. You've seen him before. Hi, Jiu-Bing. What's your major? Let's sit. Right. Bo-He often talks about you, saying you're his best guy friend. I actually got a favor to ask. See if you have some time later. We'll buy you dinner. Bo-He's business is my business. You don't need to buy me dinner. All right. Actually, I quite envy you. Having a friend growing up with each other, it's great. The professor asked me to meet him, said it's something important. You go ahead and eat first. I'll call you when I'm out of the class. Ok. Bye. How have you been? Do you attend to the classes regularly? Yes. I'm going out with Mai-Zi in the weekend. Can I tell my dad I'm going out with you? Why me? Because if I said it's you, he wouldn't ask more questions. Fine. You can. You still live in the pastry shop? Remember to get up on time. If you're late for three times, the professor would flunk you. You should go and eat first. Don't get starved. Jiu-Bing. You... remember to take your shower. Shit on your face. I said I'll protect you. How can I do that when you're with him? Shit on your face. I didn't mean to push you away. How did it come to this? Shit on your face. Shit on... Aren't you tired? Been running all day. Since you're running anyway, there's a way you can make a few buck. Don't mess with me again. How did I mess with you? You told me to confess my love and Bo-He got herself a boyfriend. That's not screwing me over? We got fined so much money, all for your confession. And you've been with Bo-He for so long without confessing your love to her. How can you blame me that she is with someone else. That's really uncalled for. Fine, what do you want? Well, since you like running, instead of running alone, you can run with someone else and feel better making money out of it. It's really you. What a surprise. You haven't been to the class for so long. I begin to forget your face. Wow, to think I have to pay to see you. And you dare charge me hourly. - Follow my call, run for it. - Run for it. One, two, run for it. Why are you slowing down? Can we stop running? No way. You booked this course to run, you have to run. Yes, yes, I paid you. But I tell you. I pay you double now so I can stop running? Sure. Having a website would be more efficient. We need to build your image as a pro pacer. Handsome. What the hell? What do you think? Is it ok? Pretty Ok, right? Tian Xia, what do you think? I don't like it. Speed up. You run like a damn granny. Speed up. It's really exhausting. Don't you want to wear a bikini? Don't you want to look sexy for your husband? Seduce my husband, move it. Move it. Fifteen, sixteen. Shit. Shit on your face. What's with the sunglasses? The first rule of running, watch where you're going. Settle down. I'm a celebrity. Don't you recognize Chia-Yen Ko? What work have you done? You're an ass. You're going only 80% of your speed. You need to do it faster next time. Tian Xia, besides running together, can he join dinner with me too? Just running, nothing else. Come on, don't be so stingy. Is he your boyfriend? - Ready. - Boyfriend. It's not like that, stop it. Boyfriend. No way. Definitely so -Fine, he is, he is. Hey, are you going to America too? What America? See that. Wow, Mai-Zi is really talented. You'll be living in silicon valley. Can I visit you there in the future? Wow, so cool. I heard that the houses in America, they all have. Tian Xia, what is this contest? Why are we wearing this? Right. We'll be chased by rabbits. You get disqualified if the rabbits catch you. So Jiu-Bing, for 100 thousand dollars, don't you fail it. Yell it with me. One hundred thousand dollars. I would rather wear nothing. It's so hot. All the carrots, are you ready? Ready. Five four three two one. When you keep running to a certain degree, your brain will release dopamine. It's something like falling in love. A neurotransmitter that makes one excited. I am curious sometime. Do I have more dopamine when I'm with Bo-He. Or when I'm running? But a lot of times, Bo-He is there cheering, the excitement of having two sources of dopamine, making me feel like the luckiest man in the world. It's really you. I won. What's wrong? Bo-He's romance comes and goes so fast. Let's break up. Perhaps the experience of her mother leaving made her unable to forgive Mai-Zi. He didn't tell her that he's going abroad. Mai-Zi is gone and didn't respond to her message at all. Hey, we're late for class. Are you hearing me? I'll get seats for us first. You should hurry. Hurry up. I'll call your dad if you don't eat, or I'll tell my mom you're not eating. She'll rush here to cook you lots of porridge with tons of celery. She can still eat like a human. I think she's ok now. She was like a zombie before. Is Jiu-Bing an expert on caring zombies? Dr. Nonsense once said the dark matter that supports a romance is the companionship. Companionship is all that matters. Stop blowing it, that's gross. She can still talk. Dr. Messaround once said, love can't be proved by experiments. Or perhaps, love don't need to be proved. I don't want to run. Running can help release dopamine. It can make you feel better. I don't want to feel better. It's ok. You don't need to. We can be depressed together. Let's go. Focus on your breathing and pace. Ok. Now run. Look forward. Don't stop your feet. What are you thinking right now? I'm thinking of Mai-Zi. You're thinking of Mai-Zi. What do you want to tell him? Mai-Zi. Do you remember we like the dumplings in the school cafeteria? Do you remember you like to hold my hands in the movie theater. Do you remember you said if I want to find a place to rest, I want to find a place to hide, to cry, you will be there. But why... though I'm the one calling a breakup, you can at least return my message, at least come say goodbye. Why do I like you more than I've imagined? Why? You fool. - All right. - You fool. Stop hitting me. - I'm not that jerk Mai-Zi. - Why? Ok ok, stop hitting. I'm not Mai-Zi. Jiu-Bing. Jiu-Bing. - Jiu-Bing. - It's fine. Mai-Zi. How are you doing in America? During that time, I tried to keep her company. Making her laugh, watching her cry. And I don't know if I should be happy or sad. Sorry to keep you waiting. You're the wind, I'm the sand. Tian Xia. I have been eating pastry my whole life. When will you go out with me? - Get on. Come on. - No way. I like someone else. Who is it? I don't care. - If you don't go out with me - Let go. I wouldn't let you go. Dad. - Hey. - Let me go. Go away. It's hot. I need my face to make a living. You're screwed. - Hey, what are you doing? - I'll punish your head. Let go. - I tell you to let go, you hear - Punish your head. Try to pick on girls? That is not cool. Not from behind. Apologize. You made a mistake. Stop showing up here. Cool my ass, this shitty place. I won't come here anymore. Can I have my hat back? - Fuck off. - Thanks, bye. Are you all right? It hurts. I passed the job interview at the café today. We can save up for traveling abroad this summer. Nice. I think your English is better than me. I learn from watching movies. Just stick to running, stop the chit-chat. Why are you getting so close? Excuse me. Honey. I'm working out to stay in shape for you. Don't come messing around. What the hell? No need to get so close and talk while running. Besides, if I'm not keeping an eye here, this dude might lead you else where. Being a pacer is a professional work. Also, with someone running together, Tang-Tang will feel more confident. Tang-Tang? It's not your place to call her that. Just call her Mrs. Tang, ok? Only I can call her Tang-Tang. Tang-Tang. It's just running, nothing professional about it. Just moving your legs around. You're calling yourself a pro pacer? I'm a pro wisecracker. And I do it for my own good, while you only run with others. Running with others. Have you ever run for yourself? Running with others your whole life. - How pitiful. - That's enough, honey. Let's stop running. What are we eating tonight? Yeah, I'm starving. Running for myself. Since she has no boyfriend now, confess to her. You're too naive. You don't get it. If I confess my love to her now, we wouldn't even be friends then. It would be suicide. So, you have three options. A. Stay friends with her forever. Ve in the friend zone as long as she pleases. B. Confess to Bo-He. Turns down by her ruthlessly, being neither a lover nor a friend. C. Bo-He accepts Jiu-Bing. They live happily thereafter, have a baby called... Bo-He Bing. I've been through all that. The problem is, it's really hard to make a choice. Because you didn't prepare for the worst. Maybe, you can pretend I'm Bo-He and confess your love to me, and rehearse for the worst-case scenario. Then perhaps, you will find courage to confess to her. - No. - Why? Because you're not Bo-He. That's not a problem. How about this? Oh great. Really well done, right? See. It's pretty much the same. So embarrassing. Come on, man up ok? Fine. Pretty much the same. Bo-He. Can you be my girlfriend? Sir, how old are you? Your pickup line is too out-dated even for my dad. Then what should I say? There is something in my eyes. Ah, what's wrong? Nothing there. I got you in my eyes. Fine. That's kinda lame. Hey, is that your thing? Yeah. No. I'm your thing. Oh wow. Jiu-Bing. Is there an earthquake? Where? You didn't feel it? My heart is pounding for you. You idiot. Let me do a magic trick for you. Then what? I'm magically in love with you. Did you hurt your knees? Not at all. But you've been tripping in my heart. So annoying. Excuse me, here's your brownie. Who do you think you are? Are you out of your mind? Do I have to tell you when I'll be back? I'm just asking. You don't need to raise your voice. I'm raising my voice? That's how I talk normally. I pay to eat in this restaurant. I get to talk how I want -Sir. Excuse me. Please calm down, and talk more gently. What's your problem? Can't you see I'm talking to my girlfriend? Can you stop acting like this? Can we just be civil here? Be civil, sure, let's do it. - I'll be civil with you. - What are you doing? - Sir, I'm calling the cops. - Go ahead and do it. - Stop it, ok? - I'll slap you. What are you doing? Can you keep it down? Can you? - Let him go. - Ok, I'll keep it down. Why are you dating this kind of man? Let him go. Let's go. - I'll expose you online and wreck you. - Let's go. It's so embarrassing. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. You? I'm fine. Be careful when you are working part-time. Sorry about that. Thank you. No problem. Well, I'll get back to my lunch. Bo-He Liang. Get over here. That hairdo doesn't really fit you. I like the way you look now. Like how? You got it all. If you're taller and with more slender legs and less obsessed with money, it'd be great. You're a dick. - Welcome. - Shit on your... Hi, Bo-He. We're not open for business yet. - But if you want something to eat. - Do you want to eat anything? No, I'm not hungry. You don't have to bother. Well, I'll let you guys talk then. You look better. Of course. Hey, nice new hair cut. I don't like it. It doesn't feel like me. Probably due to our clients are all celebrities. So... running is lame enough. It is better to have a good appearance. And Tian Xia said, having a more professional look can bring in more clients. Well, working as a pacer seems like a great job. Not so much as being great. It's just seeing them achieving their goals is pretty satisfying. One day a client told me it is really exhausting running alone, but with someone else running along. It feels pretty relieving. The movement of the arms, the pace of the strides, the rhythm of the breathing are all synchronized. Making it easier than running alone. It sounds pretty amazing. What's wrong? I didn't clean my eyes? You're all grown up. And... You're quite handsome this way. Come again, I didn't hear you. No, I'll get going. Bo-He Liang. - Say that again. - Bye. I didn't hear you. Bo-He Liang. Bo-He. There is something I want to tell you. What? I like you. Please be my girlfriend. Ok? Wow, how did you know I want this? I'm so touched. Thank you. You're the best. But, you still need to pay the rent. Watch the time, 10 more minutes. Take notes of the professor's points. How did it go last time? I'll stop being nosy because I'm fired. It sounds like I got you fired. No, why do you say that? It's just my dumb luck. I should buy you lunch, as a compensation. It's fine, don't worry. Come on, just grabbing a bite, no big deal. Come on. I saw you riding in car with some guy today. Where were you going? Who's that guy? Do you like him? That's too blunt. Do you like cars in red? I thought I saw you in one today. That's too stupid. Can you stop talking to yourself? If you want to know it so bad, just go ask her. One day, when you fall for someone, you'll understand my concerns. I'll definitely go and ask him. Unlike you. Right. How would you do it then? Do you like me? No. You're trespassing. I'll add it in the rent. You psycho. Table 2. No one at table 2. Just serve it there. The customers will arrive soon. Hurry and bring it over there. I want to take a good look at this. This pastry looks so beautiful. You haven't made this for a while. Not many people would order this. Your mom named it. I know. Mom used to call it. Flower blossoms and withers without regret. Yes. Since you know that, don't fall for it. If you do fall for it, don't regret it. Well then, can I fall for it? Of course you can. But this pastry belongs to the customers. I think you can simply appreciate it. Some day you'll have your own pastry. Remember to review it at home. Next exam will cover section 2-5 in chapter 2. Ok? Bye Bo-He. Bye. - Bye, assistant. - Bye. You're absent-minded today. Feeling down? No. Nothing. No. You're acting weird. Want to talk about it? Nothing. It's just thinking of something in the past. Where's your boyfriend? He's not here today. The class is over. I'll get going. Stop thinking about the past. You will miss the future. Teaching assistant. Don't do that. Can you be my girlfriend? You know, I saw a TV show yesterday. They're eating cockroaches. So disgusting. Don't you think? So... What's the matter? Something on your mind? Nothing. There's something. No. Forget it, you can suffer from it. So childish. What are you doing? Do girls like guys that are more mature? It depends. I like to have someone fooling around with me. Reading books or watching movies all day would be so boring. That's different. What' so different? You're a girl, not a woman. Cool guy. How cool is it now? Cool. I'm gonna rip your pants off. Boss. Hey Boss. Boss. Run. Jiu-Bing. Run, Tian Xia. Where are you going? Tian Xia. Tian Xia. Where the hell did she go? Dad. Out there. - Out there. - What's up? - Jiu-Bing. - Can you be more clear? - So many people. - What's the rush? - Out there. - Where's Jiu-bing? Jiu-Bing. Hi, welcome. Jiu-Bing. Hi, father-in-law. Get him. Wait, guys. Today we're not going to fight. Let's compete in ideas. Let's get down to business. You bitch, there's no way to run. I'm going to punish your head. Jiu-Bing. I'm busy. My Radiesse. Jiu-Bing, I'm coming. Get in here. Watch this. - Jiu-Bing. - Watch out. Careful. Are you all right? - Where have you been? - Where have I been? The balloon took me far far away. I almost couldn't make it back. Thank god Tian Xia gave us a call. Hey, we're not here to fight. Jiu-Bing. Look. See the comments? Your call has been forwarded to the voicemail. An-Yu wants Bo-He to be with him. Bo-He turns him down. He wouldn't admit to it and said that Bo-He seduced him. Now everyone on the internet supports him and Bo-He keeps herself locked in the room, wouldn't even go to the classes. Your call has been forwarded to the voicemail. Your call has been forwarded to. Your call has been forwarded to the voicemail. After the tone, the call will be charged. You can leave a message or hang up. If you want to leave messages. Your call has been forwarded to the voicemail. After the tone, the call will be charged. You can leave a message or hang up. If you want to leave messages, please press the pound sign after you hear the tone. It's over. The business is done. All because of that Jiu-Bing. He really screwed us over. It's not Jiu-Bing. Dad. You ever wonder why the four generations before all used handcarts? We don't have any money back then. It's not like that. I don't get it before. And Jiu-Bing asked me about it one day. Why do we serve the pastries so far away? And there's a counter for dancing. Isn't that weird? Well, you don't get it. We can attract more customers that way. You're the one not getting it. Serving pastries on handcarts is closer to the customers. If there's something on their minds, sitting in front of you and you make them a warm pastry, it's like being there for them, giving them courage to move on. I think maybe it's good the shop is smashed. At least we can get closer to the customers now. Who told you all this? I dreamed of mom one day and she said it. Liar. Then why didn't she come to me? Well, because mom doesn't like you. Yeah, right. You're falling down. I want you to apologize. I want you to apologize. Apologize. - What are you doing? - What the hell. What are you doing? You do that to Bo-He. People are calling her bitch now, speaking ill about her. - I want you to apologize. - Calm down. Did I do those to her? Did I leave the comments? - Why don't you calm down first? - No. - I want your apology. - Maybe. You should calm the fuck down. Let's be civil. Ok? What the fuck are you doing? Don't you know that Bo-He is not into you? The whole school knows about it. Are you a fool? You're just a rebound guy. I'm not a rebound guy. You're not a rebound guy. Then why is she with Mai-Zi? I'm not a rebound guy. You're not a rebound guy? Don't be so naive, ok? You love her, does she love you? I used to be a rebound guy for a year and a half. Her boyfriend is rich, got a car and a house. She kept telling me. She will break up with him for me. In the end, when I flew over to see her at Christmas, I sat on the porch for the whole night. Nobody was there. We do it all for the girls. For what? Just to have sex with them. So, I tried to make myself better. When you're better, you can hug one or two or three Bo-He. A piece of cake. You can have sex with one or two or three Bo-He. And you can tell Mai-Zi then. "Hey, Mai-Zi. I slept with one Bo-He today." That's fun. I can give you my car key. Take it for a spin. Hey. What's wrong with you? - Hey. - I want you to apologize. What are you doing? Apologize. Apologize for what? Apologize. After what I just said, don't you get it? I want you to apologize. Apologize for what? You said you're gonna apologize. Are you a man or not? - Apologize. - Enough already. Are you done? I want you to apologize, being as immature as you are now. - No girls in the world would like you. - Jiu-Bing. You're in college, please grow up. I don't want to keep worrying about you. Right. I'm just immature. I can be more immature for Bo-He. You want to see how far I'd go? - What are you doing? - I can be more immature. I am. - I am very... - Are you done? Fucking immature. Go away. I don't like to shower. - Knock it off. - I like to take off my pants. Such an immature guy. Don't you... You still want to push? - Aren't you going to push? - Stop acting so childish. Push. Are you going to push? Push. - Go away. - I'll push. - Ok ok. - Are you a man or not? - What's wrong with you? - What are you doing? - Jiu-bing. - Where are you going? Jiu-Bing, what are you doing? All this for a girl? What do you want exactly? It's all his fault. I want him to apologize. Are you going to be like this forever? As someone else's rebound guy? I'm not a rebound guy. I'm a pacer. I need to be with her when she's happy. Even more so when she's sad. I know I can't be with her to the finishing line. But as long as she finds the one she loves. I would be happy then. Ok? Is it all right? What a great spirit. You're just a fucking rebound guy. Stop embarrassing yourself and get back to dorm. Hey. Don't talk like that. What? You're still a rebound guy being naked. What else? Can you be more polite? He's my bro. What do you mean rebound guy? Maybe it's embarrassing being naked alone. It's an honor to do it together. You want to apologize? What's your problem? - Who's got problems? - Apologize. You're college students, not kindergarten. Apologize. You're still a rebound guy. - Apologize. - You are all rebound guys. Apologize. - Apologize. - What's wrong with you? Apologize now. Who's a rebound guy? You're the rebound guy. You guys are insane. You're all rebound guys. You're all rebound guys. Useless. Shame on you. That's enough. - Apologize. - You guys are all rebound guys. Apologize. Apologize. Apologize. Apologize. I'M PROUD I'M NOT A TOOL Apologize. Apologize. Apologize. Fine. Bo-He. It's my bad. I should help you clarify. I'm sorry. Is that enough? Bo-He. I'll always, always protect you. You're here. I'm sorry. Jiu-Bing Zhao. Are you an idiot? You've caused so much trouble growing up, making so much mess and I have to deal with them afterwards. It's still the same now. I'm tired of you being like this. Sorry. But... But why didn't you tell me... you've tried so hard... causing so much trouble, just to protect me. Why didn't you tell me? I thought I was the one keeps growing up, but not you. If you weren't there to protect me and I weren't there to help you, what will we end up, Jiu-Bing? So let's be together. Let's be together. But you don't like me. I can't change that no matter how hard I tried. I'm there for you, simply wanting to make you happy. Go. Hey, what's going on? What, wait. My pants almost fall down. I don't want us being together, just because you feel sorry for me. If we're together and you're not happy, I would rather nothing happened. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Each and all graduates. Good day. Hi, Principal. Today, the sky is clear and the sun is shining, giving blessings to our 48th-year graduates of Xing-Hai senior high school. We hope everyone will have a bright and promising future... I'm Tian Xia from class D. There is someone I like, but he doesn't like me. Isn't that Tian Xia? This feeling... I don't know what to do with it. So now, on the last day in high school, I want to have a closure. The days I like you... are sweet, sour and wonderful. Jiu-Bing Zhao. I like you. Lin-De Jiang from class B. I want to be with you. Kai-Xiang Xu from class B. I like you so much. Lei Wang from class B. I love you, please be with me. Bo-Shun Hua from class E. Can you be my girlfriend? Tian Xia from class D. I like you, please be with me. Be together. Teenage days, we all need a romance that hurts. Happy graduation. Aren't you tired, Tian Xia? You've been running in my mind for so long. You're so silly. Bye. A lot has happened in that summer. Tian Xia finally graduated and attended a college away from home. Delicious pastries. Her dad closed the shop, started selling pastries with a handcart. He said a pastry is like a world. Each has its own story. Each story reflects someone's life and each life is like a different world. He'll keep it going and provide more support. Bo-He disappeared all of a sudden. That year, we were so close. Now we're so far away. Bo-He. How's your summer vacation? I work as a pacer everyday, also study and practice for the race. Everything is on track. How are you doing over there?. Jiu-Bing. Why do you want to be a pacer? I heard you're flying to Australia. Safe trip. Don't lose to me. My mom said she really misses you. Tell me when you get back. I'll bring her to join dinner together. Here. Bo-He sent me a package. There is a letter for you. Jiu-Bing. You're right. I don't love you, but you're always the dearest person to me, closer than my family, more reliable than lovers. I realized how big the world is when I'm abroad. I got so many places I want to go. Australia is so close to the South Pole, maybe I can go see the edge of the world. You know what? I'm exploring the world all by myself and I feel very happy about it. Today, we would like to thank our wedding planner. He really devoted himself in planning it. Also, he is the best friend of the bride growing up. It works. Jiu-Bing, what are you doing? This is my wedding. It's chocolate. Mai-Zi. If for the rest of your life you dare to hurt Bo-He in anyway, next time the thing that blows up in your face won't be chocolate anymore. Wish them both a life time of happiness. Are you busy lately? Running everyday. It's exhausting. Do you need someone to run with you? I don't have so much money. It's free.
