BONNIE: (AS SANTA WOODY) Ho, ho, howdy everyone. That sure was a fun Christmas. (CRUNCHING) Hello, villagers. Shoo! Excuse me, pardon me, thank you. Hey, there, Baby Reindeer. Let's spread some Christmas cheer. (AS TRIER) I am the goblin fairy. I'll make you the most beautiful of all. Ling! (AS JESSIE) Hooray! (AS TRIER) Excuse me, miss. There's a bug in my son's ice cream, and he has a bug allergy. There you go, sweetheart. Enjoy. Oh, no! My dinosaur has escaped. I'll find you. - Did you hear that, Rex? - I am a bit concerned. No! For once, I'm finally going to get played with as a dinosaur. - Oh! - Prepare yourself. Inhabit the part. You must not play the dinosaur, you must be the dinosaur. But I am the dinosaur. Exactly! Now get out there and sparkle. (GASPS) There she is. The terrifying Tyrannosaurus. Oh, no. She laid millions of eggs. Loop, plop. Plump- (ROARS) BONNIE'S MOM: Bonnie. Get ready to leave, okay, sweetie? Coming! To be continued. Whoa'. That was fun. The way Bonnie's mind works is a mystery of science. - You make a fantastic little dinosaur. - Well done, Kitty. - I was completely convinced. - I didn't know you had it in you. - MR. PRICKLE PANTS: Brave. -(TRIER CLEARS THROAT) Oh! And, um, your portrayal of the disgruntled lunch counter patron was gripping. Oh, don't worry, Trier. Next time you'll be a dinosaur for sure. Andy used to play with me like a dinosaur all the time. Yeah, me too. It's not all it's cracked up to be. - How would I know? - Good point. BONNIE'S MOM: Honey, why don't you bring some toys to share with Mason? I'll get my spaceship. Santa Woody, Villager, Daddy Reindeer, Baby Reindeer and the terrifying Tyrannosaurus! -(ZIPPER CLOSES) -(SIGHS) Greet the world with an open heart. (TRIER GROANS IN DISGUST) BONNIE'S MOM: Remember to be polite, now. Please and thank you. MASON'S DAD: Hey! Go on upstairs, Bonnie. Mason's easy to find. Mason! Mason? (VIDEO GAME SOUNDS) MASON: Whoa! Oh, duck. Whoa, that was close! BONNIE: Um... (GASPS) You've got to be kidding me. He got an Optimum X for Christmas. - I never knew Mason liked video games. - No! What? Sadly, the controls are beyond my limitations. Limitations are the shackles we bind to ourselves. Mason! Oh. Hey, Bonnie. Whoa! You have got to check this out. - Come on. - Oh. Okay. (ALL SCREAMING) BUZZ: Mayday! Mayday! TRIER: We're going in! (ALL GRUNT) Everyone okay? REX: I guess we're not getting played with, after all. Well, who could blame her? No one could resist an Optimum X. Where is everybody? Where's Sock Ape and the little wrestlers and the Eco Force gang? Looks like we've got all afternoon to find our old friends. Or maybe some new ones. Wow. Mason really hit the jackpot this Christmas. - Nobody's this good. - We're gonna meet some new toys! I'm both excited and panic-stricken. (TRIER READING) I love it. -(SNARLING) - TRIER: Oh! Hey! Oh! (GIGGLES) Here, boy. Here, little guy. - Trier! - Come on, gang. Let's stay together. TRIER: Hey. Slow down, buddy. BUZZ: Where are you going? WOODY: Trier! REX: Hey! Trier! (ANGEL KITTY PANTING) (MAKES LIZARD CLICK SOUNDS) (GASPS) You guys, this play date just got very interesting. A complete set, fresh out of the box. - Where is everybody? - Hello? (ALARM BLARING) Hey. Motion-activated room sentry. Impressive. (YELLING) Whoa! Look at 'em. They're like dinosaurs plus. With the armor, and the little red spears. -(GROWLING AND SNARLING) -(CHUCKLES) Easy there, little doggy. (DINO-HOUND PURRING) Speak swiftly, foolish outlandish, or suffer my battle blade. Ooh. (CLEARS THROAT) We are savage warriors, eager to slake our endless thirst for conquest. (RAPTOR GUARDS MUMBLE) Ooh, nice. Everyone's so committed to their roles. REPTILES: Who goes there? (GRUNTS) Go talk to him, Sheriff. Uh, well, hi there, sir. My name is Woody and uh... Nobody cares. What fearsome dinosaurs are these? - Oh. - Oh. Greetings. I am Reptiles Maximus. And I am... Um... My name's Trier. It's Trier. You're not like our females. (SHRIEKS) Oh, you're quite a unique specimen yourself. -(CHUCKLES) -(HORN BLOWING) (CREAKING) (CHATTERING) Now we know where they keep the fossils. -(CHUCKLES) -(CLEARS THROAT) Strangers. From the unforgiving out lands. We have traveled far. From the distant Bonnie tribe. -(STIFLED LAUGHTER) - Shh! - Hmm. -(G RU TS) - Leave your offerings and be gone. -(REPTILES CLEARS THROAT) Are dinosaurs not welcome in our great city, wise Cleric? (GROANS) Fine, fine. Have them made presentable. I find their lack of armor disturbing. (CHUCKLES) To the armory! - Well, I think I'm going to head back. - I'll go with you. I've had enough Shakespeare in the park for one day. Suit yourself. See you later. (MUFFLED GRUNT) (CHUCKLING) Welcome to Battleships. (LAUGHS MENACING L) Oh, that's nice. Excellent. A nudge here, a jog there. Now go and be magnificent. Ray-Gen. Indulge this dinosaur goddess in your finest wear. Mmm, I like where this is going. Oh, look at you. A ponderous monolithic canvas to be adorned. Keep talking. The symmetry of a triceratops and such strong anterior protuberant. You are so discerning. Oh, yes. I'm quite expert in the enhancing and acclimatization of Battledress large and small. (GASPS) C)oh ! - Okay, I'll take that. - Oh, yes, of course. TRIER: And that. RAY-HON: Plasma core warheads. TRIER: Well, you never know. RAY-HON: Gauntlets. TRIER: Check. Very nice. RAY-HON: Dorsal solenoid plates. TRIER: For me? RAY-HON: Oh, most certainly. Do you have the battle fogs in "flame"? - Do you have to ask? - Dish 'em on over, little fella. Have I mentioned what a fantastic time I'm having? It is as plain as the horn on your face. -(GIG LES) -(CHUCKLES) Uh, when do I get a turn? (LAUGHS) I haven't forgotten you, brother. TRIER: It's perfect! (CLEARS THROAT) -(REPTILES CHUCKLES) - Ready for me? -(INDISTINCT WHISPERS) -(RAY-HON SHUDDERS) Well? What do you think? The Elders shall gaze upon this Battledress with full and rapturous pride. That's exactly what I thought you'd say. REX: Hey, Trier. Trier! Ha! Who's a fierce dinosaur now? (ROARS) The Ultimate Dinosaurs. (CHUCKLES) Come. Battleships awaits. This set is incredible. I could really get used to this. - Give us some muscle. - You're a bruiser, aren't ya, lad? Prehistoric buildings, dinosaur cars, whatever that thing's meant to be. What is it? The Triassic Tower of the Dream Elders through which distant beings convey cosmic wisdom from another dimension. Ah, at our house, Bonnie just yells across the room in a funny voice. (THE CLERIC GROANS) And here, the Volcano Command Base. My domain. Everyone needs an apartment shaped like their own head. Battle well, brother. With strength and honor. (GRUNTS) Prickle pants is right. You just need to be the Battledress. Your Prickly-pants is a wise prophet. Battle is everything to us. Our survival. Our legacy. From a kingdom long ago. An enigma wrapped in mystery We've battled every foe Since before the dawn of history History Battledress Battledress Battledress (ALL CHEERING) (CHUCKLES) You even have a theme song? (SIGHS) You seem to have everything. (CHUCKLES) You are a puzzle, Trier. Well, technically, I'm a pose able action figure. (CHUCKLES) Now tell me more of your world. Oh, it's nothing like this. I'll bet you have the most amazing play times. Play times? I do not understand. Oh, you know, play. When you give yourself over to a kid. Giving is surrender. A Battledress would never surrender. Ooh. So serious. (CHUCKLES) Trier, you cause me to question all that I know. (G ROWS) (BEEPING) Time for battle! Time for battle! - Time for battle! Time for battle! -(BATTLESHIP RS YELL) Oh, what's that? The great Dream Elder beckons us, to the Arena of Woe. Okay. (ALL CHEERING) BATTLESHIP RS: Reptiles! Reptiles! BATTLESHIP R: Ay, love you! (CHEERING) (GASPS) (ROARS) (CHEERING UPROARIOUSLY) (GIGGLING) (ROARING) Well, this seems festive. (CREAKING) Let the battle begin. (HORN BLOWING) RAPTOR GUARD: Get on up there. Sock Ape! Pen go! Fauntleroy! Oh, this'll be good. I'll do a jab, then you pretend to attack me, then... You guys are so jumpy- (SHOUTING) -(CHEERING) - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Why are you doing this? -(WHIMPERS) -(G RU TS) (ALL CLAMORING) It's doomsday. (G ROWS) (RIPPING) TRIER: Hey! (DINO-HOUNDS SNARLING) - Trier? - Trier? - What? - Trier, the Battledress are not playing. They've never been played with. They don't even know they're toys! Incredible, isn't it? (SINISTER CHUCKLE) (REPTILES YELLING) (GASPS) No! You got a crayon? (YELLING) (LOW GROW L) (G ROWS ANGRILY) BUZZ: Buzz-Buzz-Buzz Lighthearted to the rescue! Blast. -(DINO-HOUNDS SNARLING) -(GRUNTING) - Back off, you... - What? You bully! Curse! Release the Goliath on. (CHEERING) (LAUGHING EVILLY) (ROARS) Whoa, whoa, whoa! (GRUNTING) Oh! (SLURPS) (CHEERING) Cough up my friends, you, you... (ALL GASPING) As I suspected. She bears the mark of obedience. What? This? I thought I knew you. I was thinking the same thing. She is an enemy to the tribe. Ray-Gen. The Supplication. The Supplication? Hardly a suitable nomenclature. - I will not stand for this sort of abuse. -(LAUGHS EVILLY) (YELLS) Rex, have you completely lost it? I'm sorry. I can't control myself. There is no escape, Trier of the Bonn-Ye tribe. (LAUGHS) (GASPS) Bonnie! - BUZZ: Run, Trier! - Get Bonnie! -(DINO-HOUNDS SNARLING) -(GASPS) Reptiles. Stop her. (GRUNTS) Huh? What? (GRUNTS) (CHUCKLES) (CHATTERING) Hmm! Robot. Obey. (STARTLED GRUNT) Oh! Ah! Oh! E! WOODY: Rex. BUZZ: Rex. REX: I can't help it! (CHOKING) - Woody. - What? Hey! Hey, that's Mason and Bonnie. Oh, I get it. You're glad Mason got the Optimum X. He plays there. While I rule here. My Battledress have no use for play. They have everything they need, content in their ignorance. - What's ignorance? -(G RU TS) You've been a busy little tyrant. And only two clays since Christmas. Key-List-Mass? The joy that you give to others is the joy that comes back to you. - Aw. -(GRUNTS ANGRILY) - You will all be cast into the pit. - Pit? 132:: (LAUGHING EVILLY) (TRIER PANTING) I've got to shut it down. (slalom-ls) (GRUNTS) - Come on, buddy. Fight it off. - Rex, resist the Supplication. Sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, boy. - No. -(GASPS) (GASPS) (G ROWS) Reptiles. Your world is bigger than you know. Let me show you who you really are. But I am a Battledress. You can be so much more. And you know it. (THE CLERIC LAUGHS EVILLY) (RAPTOR GUARDS CHANTING) (PLAYING SOLEMN TUNE) Pipe down, you. Reptiles, it's your kid who chooses what you're going to be. It could be a dinosaur, a baby reindeer or something you'd never even think of. It's about being there for your kid. It's about... Surrender. Huh? - This bus is out of gas. - Dang it, the power's down. Oh, hello. Are you lost? Come see my igloo. We can wait inside with the polar bears and the salamanders until they find us. Check the supplies. We have hamburgers, spaghetti, pancakes, chocolate milk, gummy worms... - Oh, what planet is he from? - Neptune! Or maybe Florida. (BUZZ AND WOODY GROANING) -(SCREAMING) - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (LAUGHS) (BOTH LAUGHING AND WHOOPING) We crash-landed on the party planet. Aliens everywhere. Wait. Where's my baby reindeer? (GASPS) There she is. (WHISPERING) She says, "Put on your dance pants." (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Look, Buzz, I'm a boneless chicken. BONNIE: (AS TRIER) How about a dance, Uncle Wormy? MASON: (AS THE CLERIC) I don't know how. BONNIE: (GASPS) He's adorable. MASON: Loop! Loop! Beep! Bop! BONNIE: Come on, Mega-Monster, let's fight some crime. (BONNIE AND MASON LAUGHING) That was glorious. It was, wasn't it? MASON'S DAD: It's always so great to have Bonnie around. Let's have her back next week. BONNIE'S MOM: So, shall we say Tuesday around 3:30? - BONNIE'S MOM: Bonnie! -(MAKES AIRCRAFT LANDING SOUNDS) - Dinner, sweetie. - Bye, toys. Whoa-hoe'.! So, how was the play date? Oh, you know, typical crash-landing. Hostile lizard people, hand-to-hand combat. And I was a mindless, lumbering automaton. - Well, that part adds up. - What about you, Trier? Have you finally found a role that suits you? - Goblin fairy, ghost clown... - Hey, hey! Easy now! "Dancing queen, a baby reindeer. You name it. I'm Bonnie's dinosaur. And Bonnie's dinosaur gets to be everything. Be grateful for your gifts. They are all around you. ALL: Awe. (SOCK APE SNORING) (THE CLERIC SIGHS) Farewell, Trier of the Bonn-Ye tribe. My heart will burn bright at the moment of your return. Tuesday, around 3:30.
