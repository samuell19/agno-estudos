- You sure he wants the boat? Isn't that new? - That's Alan's latest antiques. Supposed to make us rich on those American visitors. Father would have been proud of him. - The Gil Dental and Rosa Soivefolia spray. They're magnificently preserved. You know, this was designed when Mozart was still in his 20s. - You do take credit cards. - Mmhmm. - 'Kay. - Alan. Am I interrupting? - Barbara, what a surprise. - Well, if you're busy, I can easily look around for a bit. - No, no, no, of course not. Deirdre, would you take care of the gentleman, please? - Yes, of course, Mr. Alan. Excuse me. I heard you made Copenhagen. - Mmm. - Well, I've been nominated to take you to the ferry. Your mother's given me your suitcase, and I've packed a picnic lunch. - Well, look, I don't know, I, - Oh, but it's such a lovely day. We can stop by the lake, and I've even got your swimming trunks. - I might have known. Come on. - Ah, it's my new favorite. - Here, let me help. - You swim like a fish. - No, not really. But it's the only sport I enjoyed at Oxford. That's better. - Oh, Alan, I love you so much, I'll do anything for you. And I will. - Barbara. I like you. You're very desirable. Look, I don't want just a fling, mmhmm? - Please. I think we should go. Alan, darling. Will you do a dive, just for me? Deeper. That's right. Oh, you're marvelous. - Help me. Help me. I'm lost. Help me. - Oh. - Hey. - Lovely to see you. How are you? - I've got your ceramics expedition all arranged. - Wonderful. - So, you will be up to your ears in antiques. - Alan is going to be very happy. Isn't he, John? - The antiques have expanded beyond my wildest dreams. Look at all these orders. - Wonderful, take a bread. - Thanks. I'm gonna need a short-hand typist that can cope with German and English as well as Danish. - I suppose that could be arranged. - Oh, good. In England, they could do with knowing a whole lot more about porcelain and antiques. - And Alan is going to change all that? When are you going to get married to a nice Danish girl, so she can help you spend all that money you're going to make? - No, you don't, one mother's enough. - Oh, here we are. Per Simonsen. He has this German girl, she's supposed to be very good, so all your orders will be ready on Friday. - Great. - Well, I have to go now. - Okay, buh-bye. - Oh, Alan? Don't be late, we're leaving right after supper. - Okay, buh-bye. - Bye. - Are you Mr. Desland? - Yes, yes, that's right. And you must be Ms. Forrester. Oh, please, come in. Please, do sit down. Now, which ones would you like to start with? The English ones, or will they be more difficult for you? Right. Dear Ms. Kaplan, that's K-A-P-L-A-N. This is just a short note. To let you know that your set of six Colford dining plates have arrived. And are awaiting collection in my office. I look forward to seeing you soon. Sincerely, Alan Desland. Alan Desland. That's it, I think. Thank you very much. I tell you what, I'll drop by on Friday. Just so that we can take a quick look at them. If you're not too busy. - I shall not be busy. - Alan? - Well, you shouldn't have done this, Mr. Desland. We know the Champagne is very good, but we don't know if the letters are. - Oh, I'm sure they are. - Now, you shall see. - Oh, look, this is very kind of you, Mr. Simonsen, but don't you think I should see Ms. Forrester myself, just for a moment? The fact is I've bought her a little gift. - I'll give it to her. - No, I would like to see her personally, just for a moment. The German one's faultless. I like this. She spelled, - Good morning, Mr. Desland. I hope you had a nice trip. Yes, I did. I'd like to thank you for these letters, they're excellent. - Oh. And so now, you must go back to England. - Must is right. I always hate leaving Copenhagen. - Oh, haven't you got any friends in England? - Yes. But I always leave my heart in Copenhagen. It gets so heavy at the prospect of leaving that I can't afford the excess baggage. - Well, we must take care of you. Mr. Simonsen, you are kind employer. Can you find a job for Mr. Desland's heart? - Mr. Anderson is here, shall I send him in? - No, I'll come out. Excuse me one moment, Mr. Desland. - Of course. - Excuse me, Mr. Desland. - Ms. Forrester. I was wondering, if you're not doing anything this evening, would you care to have dinner with me? - Will it be somewhere very nice? - It can be wherever you like, you tell me. - Oh. I don't know about restaurants. But I will be delighted, Mr. Desland. - Good. I'll call for you, then? - No, I'll meet you at the restaurant at, nine o'clock? - Fine. Nine o'clock then, at La Cocotte? - Okay. Ms. Forrester. - I'm so sorry I'm late. - Are you really? - No, not really. - A drink for mademoiselle? - Oh. What shall I have? - Sherry, dry martini, gin and tonic? - But I ask you, really. - A dry sherry, then, and a gin and tonic for me. - Yes. - That's a beautiful cloak you're wearing. - Oh, but it's not mine. I borrowed it, Alan. - You know my name? - You don't know mine. - I'd like to. - Karin Forrester, with dots, to show I'm a dotter, you know. What is that? - That's snails. - Really? - And they're very good. - Can I try? - Mmm. - Mmm. Delicious. Now I've also had garlic. Oh, more champagne, oh. Oh, I'm feeling drunk. No, not drunk. What would I say? Tipsy? Can you say that? - Yes, we're both tipsy. - Yeah, good. How nice. - Karin, can I meet you tomorrow. No, seriously, can I? - I will telephone you later, Alan, I can do that. - I'll get you a taxi. Thank you, no, it's not far. - You want to walk? - No, I will take the bus. There is a bus, I call it the always bus, because always, I have to take it. - Karin, please, let me take you. - Really, it was lovely, I enjoyed it very much. Everybody has garlic. You said you wanted to see the ceiling paintings in the king's chamber. - Yes, I know I did. But it's sunny and warm here. Besides, I feel lazy. - That's not like you. - How can you tell? You hardly know me. - Oh, but I can tell, all the same. You're a man who always go to a place for a purpose, to see a piece of art, or something, aren't you? - Yes, I suppose I am. - But today, you put your head down and forgotten to get up again. Come on, come on. Let's go see something. - You all right? - Yeah. How silly, I tore my foot off. Oh, what nice one, look. Well, you just give me your arm, Alan. I will be alright. - You sure? - Yes, thank you. Here's a nice job for you, Alan. Will you please check if it's a bad fall? It's tickling. I sorry, come back here. I make another. - Let's have a look at the other one. Hey, you've cut yourself. - It will be all right. - We need some water for this. - Lick your fingers. Go on. - Can I see you later? - Oh, not this evening. - You can't have dinner? Unfortunately, it's impossible. - Well, what about tomorrow? I'm leaving on Monday. - Oh, I have to be out of Copenhagen tomorrow. What a pity. - Well, I hope I see you the next time I'm here. Thank you again for the letters. The letters. - Nice flight. See you back, remember. - I've changed my mind. Take me to the Plaza Hotel. Karin. Hi. - Oh, hey. You're still here. - Oh yes, I decided to stay on for a bit, unfinished business. - Yes. - I see your foot's better. - My foot? Ah, my foot, yes. I've quite forgotten it, it's fine. - Karin, can we meet later? - Oh, I can't this evening, Alan. It would be nice, but I can't. - Are you really sure? I mean, not even for a drink, perhaps-- - No, I can't. Alan, please don't press me. - I'm sorry. What about tomorrow evening. - Um. - Well? - Let me think, Alan, for a bit. Yes, I think perhaps I might be able to arrange tomorrow. Can I telephone you later? - Yes, I'm staying at the Plaza. - Yes, all right then, I'll ring you tonight between 8:00 and 9:00. - I'll be waiting. - All right. Alan? - Yes? - Hello, Karin? - Alan? - Hi, how was your day? - All I had was old office. Listen, Alan, there's a piano recital at the Tivoli. Do you think that would be nice? - Oh, that sounds marvelous. Well then, I'll meet you there at 8:00. - Right. Oh, listen, Karin, I saw you you earlier today. - You saw me, where? - Yeah, in a park. - Mmhmm. Then you must have seen- - Hello? - I'm so sorry I'm late. Thank you so much. See, it has to end. So, you saw me in the park. - Mmm, under a lime tree. - Then, I suppose you must seen Inge and the little girl. - Well, I may have. I saw another girl your age with you. That must have been Inge. How old's Inge's little girl? - Three, nearly four. - And what does her husband do? - Oh, she's not married. - Oh, I see, she just has the little girl. - But there is someone who's thinking of marrying her, and she thinks she will have him. - You mean, not the little girl's father? - No, someone else. - And he doesn't mind taking on the little girl? - Should he? - I would. Well, I suppose I shouldn't but, yes, I think I would mind that very much indeed. Anyway, good luck to them. Let me know how it works out. Well, that is, if you write to me. Karin, you will write, won't you? - It has been such a beautiful evening. What a pity it has to end. - But it doesn't. I'll see you home. - No, I must go now. You walk me back to the always bus. Alan, what's wrong? You look so serious. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - Can you follow a rose, Alan? - I'm sorry? - The sun shines, and it blooms. But then, after a time, the petals fall. I wish I had your brains. - You have more. And you don't need them. Wings are the thing. - No, it would be an awful circumstance. - Now, that's got nothing to do with it. - Well, if I had wings, I'd fly away from here. But here comes the always bus. Alan, can you lend me a quarter to pay with? - Yes, sure. Hello? - Alan, you telephoned. - Yes. Look, can I see you after work? Just for a short time? - Is something wrong, Alan? - Well, I want to say goodbye. I'm going back to England. - Well, I'm sorry you have to go, Alan. But I do understand. You have your work and your mother, and your home to look after. - The time went so quickly. You know, you're very different from all those porcelain ladies on shelves that I have to go back to. I can understand them. - You don't understand me? - No, they're like flowers. They stay still to be admired. You're more like a bird. - What bird? - The kingfisher. She flashes down the river, and she's gone. Gone, before you have time to think how wonderful. - Yes, yes, but you're the one that's leaving. Well. I shall miss you. - Karin, you must have lots of friends. - Hm. - Yes, I know that. While the moon moves calmly through the vault of heaven, thus you move, beloved, calmly and surely. And only your image trembles in my heart. That's Heine, isn't it? Karin? - It's not the poem, Alan. At least, yes, it is. But it's not just the poem. - Well, what then? - It's about this kindness. The style. All you have given me last week. There's so little of that in my life, you see. And now, you have to go. But I do understand, really, Alan. I'm not going to make a fuss. It's just really hard. You must know. How can I help it? I'm sorry to make a scene, Alan, really. It's just, I have never met anyone like you. - You've never met anyone like me? - No, I mean someone who, who behave like a gentleman, you know? Who I could feel safe with, love and tease without being taken the wrong way. Alan. Oh, I'm sorry. Alan. Well, I'm afraid I haven't got your English detachment. No, just let me get myself straight. I know, and you can put me on the always bus, and I go off. - Karin, do you really mean this? - Yes, I do. - Oh Karin, listen to me. I've loved you from the moment I first saw you. I love you to distraction. I'm only going away because I thought that you'd never, Karin, if you want me I'm yours, forever. Will you marry me? - You ask me marry you? - Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. - It's not true. It's not to believe. - I ask you again. Would you like to marry me? - More than anything. Anything in the world. - In 12 months, Alan, I will know everything there is to know about old china. - Charming. You don't think I'm marrying you to get a fee assistant, do you? - No, but, - You have an amazing heart. I admire your courage. - Last night, you said you loved me to destruction. - Loved you to, oh no, my precious darling, to distraction. To confusion, perplexity, frenzy, madness. - Ah, so, distraction. Oh, yes. Well listen, dearest Alan, now we must not be distracted. What are we going to do? - Well, supposed I should go back now. Tell my family, put the shop straight. It won't take long, and I'll ring you everyday. And then, I come back for you. - Oh no, why not the other way, I'll make the arrangements, the lease and these things, and then, I come over and join you. - But aren't we going to be married in Germany? - No, in England. - Your home, your family, Karin. - I'll join you just as soon as I can. - It's going to raise a few eyebrows in Northbrook. - Oh, I love you. I long for you. Do you want to make love now? I'll do whatever you want. - You know I do. But Karin, you see, - Oh, that's really an Englishman talking. It is half what he needs. You mean to make it sacred. - Well, yes. That's about it. - Well then, at any rate, you must let me out of your arms, because it's driving me crazy. - So, what part of Germany does she come from? - I have no idea, she never told me. But she's been living in Copenhagen, well for some time. Her Danish is absolutely perfect, and her English, too. - Well, what does her father do? - I don't know. I've never asked. Oh mom, you know how it can be sometimes with Germans. For all I know, her parents may be behind the iron curtain, even dead. Karin will tell me when she's ready. - I think she might have told you a bit more about herself. I mean, she'd know that I'd want to know, don't you think? - Mom, just wait 'til you meet her. The proof of the pudding's in the eating, you know. - And you're the one who'll be eating it, dear. - Hm. - Mr. Alan. That right, you're getting married, then? - Yes, it is indeed, Deirdre. She's looking forward to meeting you. - That right, she's German? - Yes, she is. - Mr. Alan, I'm sorry to disturb you. There's a transfer charge call from Copenhagen. I've refused to accept it, but they're insisting. - Mrs. Taswell. I'm coming. Hello, operator? Yes, I'll accept the charge. Yes, please put the call through. - Alan? - Karin. How are you, my darling? Is everything okay? - Well, I shall see you very quickly now, Alan, and we can be married as soon as you're able to arrange it. - Oh, that's marvelous. When can I come over? - Oh, you need not. I arrive at Heathrow on Monday. - What, you mean this Monday? - Are you not pleased? - Well, no, yes, of course I am. It's just that, you've taken my breath away. I never dreamt that you'd be ready so soon. Have you said goodbye to Simonsen? - Yes, and the always bus. - And Inge, and her little girl? - Yes. Then you meet me, - Yes, of course. What'd Simonsen say when you told him we were getting married? - Oh, I didn't tell him, only that I was leaving. - Oh. - Well, there's no need to be telling everything to everybody, is there? Alan, dearest, I must go now. - Well, goodbye, my darling. Give the most humble and hearty thanks for all Thy goodness and loving kindness to us, and to all men. - Alan, are you going balmy? - Karin? - I missed you. So, now to kiss. Sorry. It's just, I'm a bit tired. Had a seat stretching. - Come on, put you in some hot bath. I'm next door, if you need me. - Alan, don't go. Please don't go. - Karin, what is it? - I'm afraid. I'm afraid of the dark. - Always. But I'm terribly afraid now. I know it's silly, Alan, but please stay 'til I sleep. - Of course I will. Come. - Would you like to take it off? - You know I would. - All right then, take it off. - What, now this minute? - Yes. - Well, I, - All right, then. I will. - German Aphrodite arrested in Hyde Park. - That's a silly plot. I feel so proud. I thought I'd dress for you, and for everybody. You love me? - You drive me to distraction. - So, you see my motive and exhibition is to drive everyone crazy. Oh Alan, is there anything I can tell you about myself that would be able to change your mind? - Absolutely nothing. Nothing could make any difference. Oh, Karin, I love you. Come on, I'm going to buy you lots of clothes. How does that grab you? - Oh, Alan, I could cry, really. - My mother's putting up the bands this Sunday. With all the invitations and arrangements, I still think Tony could marry us in three weeks. Well, you do want a white wedding, don't you? - Alan, I don't think I can marry you in a church. I mean, I don't want to do that. - But why, darling? Can it, oh God, I've been such a fool. I never asked you, you're Catholic, or Calvinist, or something, is that it? - Please stop, Alan, I- - Darling. Don't be afraid to tell me. Look, if you were in the biggest legal jam, I'd get you out. Have you been married before? Is it something like that? - No Alan, no, I'm not married. No, I never have been. That you can believe absolutely. I just feel that, well, I can't be married in a church, that's all. It will have to be an office, or something. - A registry office? - Yes. - But darling, my family, all the people that know me will think it rather odd. It really will be best in church. - Alan, are you saying that otherwise, it can't happen? Please, don't say that. I can't explain why, but please, do this one thing for me, I promise. - All right. - Right? Okay. I'm sorry. - Quite apart from that, there's the minimum residence requirement, all the red tape. - Well, to start with, Alan, it doesn't matter if you're married ina registry office, or a church. A hell of a lot of communicants I've known personally get married in there. As for your own feelings, you must put them entirely on one side. - What will people say? - You mustn't let it affect you. Look. I'll pop by for tea tomorrow, and I'll wear a collar and tie, and I'll talk nothing but Mozart. - Karin? I'll stay 'til you sleep. - Oh. No. Because if you did tonight, I shouldn't be able to sleep. But I'd like you to undress me, Alan, please. - Undress you? You mean, you want to make love? - Good heavens, Alan. Do you realize how much you've exhausted me today? I'm tired out with your kindness and generosity. But make love? I want you to undress me, that's all. Don't you sometimes like to be made a fuss of? Please? You think I'm nice? Do you? - You're beautiful. - You think nothing else? - No. - No, oh, you do. I think I will wear my dressing gown to sleep in tonight. It's over there. Put it on for me, Alan, please. Tell me a poem. - There, there, we will go, oh my love, with thee. And I will, I will. - Don't worry, Karin, you'll be an instant success in Barkshire. - Oh, well, I won't be with Alan if I don't hurry up and get changed to meet this Mr. Steinberg. Please, excuse me. - She's wonderful She's beautiful beyond words. She's smashing, she's gorgeous, just tell me when to stop. - Stop. But. - I think you've got a job for life. That sort of beauty puts a tremendous strain on the possessor. She has to live with it night and day. People like that need a lot of looking after. - Mr. Steinberg. - Alan. How are you, my friend? - Good to see you, I'm well. - And you must be Alan's preacher-man-friend. - Mr. Steinberg, I'm delighted to meet you. - The same goes for me. - Well, here it is. The Dr. Wall punchbowl. - How's this sound to you, Alan? You young people don't want to wait around for the registry. Fly to America and get married the day after tomorrow. - America? No, that's not possible. - Now, hear me out. Tickets are on me. - Oh come on, Mr. Steinberg. - Wedding present. - Alan. - I have this beautiful home in Florida, perfect place for a honeymoon. - Invested in me under the laws of the state of Florida, I now pronounce you man and wife. Congratulations. - I'm sorry, Karin. I just can't. I don't know what's wrong. - Darling. - Oh, God. - You don't understand, do you? This is love. I am your lover. We are making love. This is what I was born for, don't you see? I could cry for joy. Can't you see? - Look, Karin. - Such a silly sweetheart. You think it's a little pond of boats, don't you? Chug, chug. Come in, number five, your time is up. Darling, it is a great ocean out there. It's vast. Limitless. One doesn't want this ocean to part. What are you in such a hurry for? - Karin, look. - What? - There, on that branch. - I'm going to take these silly clothes off. Alan? - Alan. Alan. Alan. There's a body. - What? - There's a body down there. It's a little. - Just grab hold of me, come on. - No, no. - Come on, we'll go to shore. Listen, darling, you stay here now, and I'll go and see what it is, okay? It's all right, Karin. Really, it's all right. It's just an old log. I'm sure. Karin, I touched it. It's okay, really. It's an old log. - I'm so relieved. See what I mean? How far is Covington from the sea? - It's about 60 miles. Why? - Oh, it's quiet. The stories of the house. Oh, Alan. Oh, the piano. You remember? Oh. Do you play? - No, not really. My mother does, once in a while. - I am so happy. - Would you want some tea? - No. - Do you want to see the rest of the house? - No, no, stupid. I want to fuck you. Look, a standard, it's eye like a fish, just like you told me. Could he harm us, do you think? - How do you mean? - Well, after all, this is his place, isn't it? We'd come into his place. - Flick and I used to play here when we were kids. - You had a happy childhood, didn't you? - Well, didn't you, my darling? Hey, you never told me. - Very well. I tell you all about myself, everything before I met you. - No. You were full-born in Parfus. I know, I was there. It's pure box office. They've been sentimentalizing Mary Magdalene for 500 years. - Come on, Tony, stand up and defend Mary Magdalene. - Most people reckon that the sin she felt so sorry for was sexual. - Well, you're right, of course. - Oh, so you're begging him, Tony. - No, actually, I'm not sure I am. I think the idea of Christ offering forgiveness to girls who get themselves in trouble answers a need. - Ah, people want to destroy the past. Now, if Christ were alive today, do you really think he would say that sex without marriage was wrong? - Well, I think his line today would be the same. It's understandable and forgivable, but wrong to the extent that it's less than the best. - Oh, hm. - Hm. Yes, but going back to the Mary Magdalene legend, if she was a prostitute, which I don't for a minute accept- - Can any sin be forgiven? - Yes. Always provided, people can forgive themselves. That's sometimes hard, sometimes impossible. Like Lady Macbeth. - That's the problem with you English. You're always bringing up Shakespeare, and what is a poor German girl to do? It's beautiful. - Deirdre, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Desland. - Oh, it's so nice to meet you. - Coh, Mr. Alan. - I'm gonna let you two get to know each other, see what problems I've got upstairs. - So, you show me around the shop? - I've accepted your invitation to the Paddington Auction. I hope that's all right. - Yes, Farrington, yes, that's fine. Anything else? - Hm? - Important letters? - Letters, yes. Well, there are one or two. - No, no, don't stop. - Alan, oh. Mmm. Oh, Alan, I'm so cross. I made a chocolate mousse, but I put one egg too much, so it doesn't get stiff. - It does, darling, I can assure you. - Oh look, you have a button missing. Take it off. Where do you keep your master sewing board? - Flick used it last night. She's always leaving things behind. I always have to send onto her. - Well, this time, it is better did alone. - No, you stay there, I'll get it. - All right. - What did I tell you? - What was it? - A stuffed toy, lying in full view of the arm chair, if you please. - The blue teddy bear. - No, it wasn't it was a green tortoise. I don't remember Angela playing with it. - What did you say? - A green tortoise. Darling, what's the matter. - There isn't a green tortoise, there isn't. No, I know Angela didn't have anything like that. There's no green tortoise. - What on earth's the matter- - No, I tell you, that isn't a green tortoise, Alan. Now, you go and look. - What? - Go and look, go and look. - I've just been to see- - No! Do as I say, go back and look! - All right, I'll get the bloody thing down and show you. I was wrong, I'm sorry. - There isn't any tortoise. - No, there isn't. It was a, look, it was a silly mistake. Look, I'm sorry. Hey, it's our first quarrel. Forgive me. - I should be the one to ask to be forgiven. Shall I explain? You see, when I- - No, no, no. No, never explain. Never complain. It's over now. Look, it stopped raining. Let's take a walk around the garden, before it gets dark. - Was it a bad dream? - 1,500 in front of me, 1,600 pounds, sir. - 1,600. - Thank you, 1,600 pounds, I bid fast. Set that down, you shouldn't be in here. Just get across there. 1,600 pounds, against the rest of you. 1,600 pounds, 1,700 I won't, it's 16. 17, sir? 1,700 pounds. Oh, on faith, it's 1,700, it's against the rest of you. 1,700 pounds. - 1,800. - 1,800 pounds. 1,900 anywhere, all done, all finished. Your lot, sir. - Bloody hell, they won't be able to make a profit at that. - It's disastrous. I've overpaid for everything. - Well, old boy. You fancy a pub lunch, Mrs D? - No, you take Alan, I'll stay for the jewel plots. - Well, for God's sake, don't go mad, it's mostly rubbish. Have a jolly time, I'll bring you back a sandwich. - Oh with ham, don't forget the mustard. Lots of it. - 12 pounds I've bid, any more than 12, otherwise I'll sell. Any more? Sold to the lady on my right. - Excuse me, can you tell me what they're bidding for? - Oh, just pots and pans. - Will somebody start with 10 pounds, then? Will somebody start with 10 pounds? - Eight. - Eight pounds is a start, madame, at least. At eight pounds I have bid. Nine, may I have. - Nine pounds. - Nine down here. 10 may I have? - 10 pounds. - 10 pounds in the center of the room. May I have 11? 11 pounds anywhere? - 11. - I've 11 pounds on my right. - Stupid woman. Why can't she bid properly. 12 pounds. - 12 pounds. - 13. - 14 pounds. - 30 pounds. - 30 pounds. 30 pounds for these saucepans. Evidently, it is a very nice saucepan. 30 pounds, I've bid, to order. Sold to the lady on my right. - I hope you need pots and pans. - Who is this absurd young woman, do you suppose? Obviously foreign, you can tell by the accent. Probably the wife of one of those foreign dealers, if she is a wife. - Oh, she's a wife, all right. My wife, actually. Rather nice, don't you think? - What else did you buy? - I'd tell you, but it's a secret. Nothing, really. - Well, thank God for that. 30 pounds is a lot to spend for old saucepans. - Well, I wanted it. I'll explain it all when I get back from Bristol. - Oh, look, you want to say goodbye. Give me that, and I'll put it in the car. - Oh wait, wait, I'll take this with me. - Bye bye, Karin, see you soon. - Bye bye, nice to meet you. I gotta go, I'm late. - You drive carefully, now. And try and persuade Mom to come back with you. I'll be away from my girl. - Okay, bye bye. - Give my love to mom. - All right, bye bye. - Alan, I know you didn't have a formal wedding, but I'd like you to, both of you, have this wedding gift. - Barbara, that's very sweet of you. I'm touched, thank you. - Where is your wife? Isn't she here? - Oh, they should be here any minute now. They must have gotten caught up in the traffic from Bristol. Mom and Karin seem to have hit it off, I'm glad to say. There she is. - Oh, please, everybody, please sit down. Alan. - Darling. - That's better. I hope Alan's been looking after you. - Oh yes, very well - Oh, please excuse me one minute. I forgot it. - Mom. - Alan, darling. We've fallen in love with your Karin. - And so have we. - Oh, Anne. - Alan, can you give me a hand for a minute? - Excuse me a sec, I won't be long. - Alan, oh. Hi. Oh, yes. Be quiet. Have me. - Are you all right, Alan? Do you want any help? - I'm doing fine, thanks, we won't be a minute. Oh, gentleman, please adjust your dress before leaving. I love you so much. - Thanks, Alan. - Bye. - Bye. - All right, nice to see you, too. - Give you all the details. Goodbye darling. - Goodbye, thank you again. - Bye bye, dear. - Bye, Mom. - Lovely to see you both. - Drive carefully. Bye. - I don't know whether to smack you, crown you with roses, or have you certified. If someone had come in. - But they didn't. - I have a local position to keep up. - Mmm, you did keep it up splendidly. It was all just impulsive. - You planned it. - And what if I did? And what do they know? I'd give the whole world for you, how do you know I haven't? Hm? This is what I really bought at the auction. It was among the pots and pans and things. I may have been silly, but I hope not. - Karin, do you know what this is? - No, I just thought it looked it nice. You know, with all you've taught me about porcelain. - My God, I'm afraid to say. - What do you think it is? - It's the girl in a swing. Well, if it is, it's gonna set the ceramic world on fire. - Is it valuable. - Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Now, first things first. For a start we must get this authenticated. - You know what I wished for on the white horse? - What? - I wish I could find something of great value at the same and buy it, all on my own. Well, shall I make some tea? That's a proper British thing to do, isn't it? - Only two figures are known to exist. One in the Boston Fine Arts Museum. The other in the V&A. But this third one's undoubtedly genuine. Certainly going to set a lot of people talking. - What do you think it would fetch at auction? - 200,000 pounds. That sort of thing. - Karin? Darling? Karin? - You know now. - Yes. - Who I am. - You are not to be named. You have many names. - And yet, I have need of you. So drink, my lord. Get up, lazy bones, you'll be late for work, now. - Karin? What happened last night? - What happened? Darling, you were there as well as me. - Well yes, but tell me, I want to know what happened. - Very well. It was baking hot, so I went for a swim in the river, and, this all seems to be very silly to me, Alan. - No, go on, I want to know. - Well, I sat on the swing, and forgot about time. And you can lopping around the corner, like a sort of human goat, and, - And? - You raped me. It was pure heaven. Even by our standards. Look. Scratched all over. And then, after that, you simply went off to sleep, like the King of Babylon. - But didn't you experience anything unusual? Like a trance. - Oh, poor love, what trance? Just don't call me that now. - Karin, you're impenetrable. - Oh no, now that's one thing I am certainly not. - Oh, Karin, I forgot. The girl in the swing. - Yeah? - She's worth more than 200,000 pounds. - Oh, well, good for the white horse. I'm glad it makes you happy. - Are you going to sell it? - Oh, yes. Karin set us up for life. - Go on, Tony, warn us about the evils of riches. - Not me. Riches put it in a man's hand to do more good. You're not going to move away, I hope. - Lord, no. What, and miss all our weekly sessions on life, death, and reality? - Well, that's very generous of you. - Lovers can't afford to feel generous. Christ should have expressed that. I wish I could have talked to him a bit before he started. - And what would you have said? - People live in bodies, you know? If they can't feel kind and merciful, if they're not loving properly, they're worthless. - I think perhaps Christ knew that. - But he didn't say it, Tony. He taught that spiritual love was a difficult business. He didn't say that physical love was, too. That's supposed to be easy. The idea of unselfish physical love's not tied to Christianity. There's not a word about it in the marriage service. - Is that right? - So, do you think the pagan cults were better? - They certainly were. - Perhaps you've got a point. There's a lot that's very attractive about pagans. - Good morning, darling. Happy Month-iversary. - Hm? - It's exactly two months since we met. Yeah. I'll tell you something else, if you'd like. - What? - I'm three weeks overdue. - What? Are you really? - Yes. - I don't believe you. - I am, I am. No, no, no. Come on, we'll be late for work. - Wonderful, I'll have it right up for you. Deirdre, could you please wrap this for Mr. Gray? - Certainly, Mrs. Desland. - Thank you. Good morning, Mrs. Pelt. - I'm calling Per Simonsen. I'll tell him about the girl in the swing. - Why not tell somebody else? Somebody not in Copenhagen? - Why? Aren't you proud of your discovery? - Well, I'm finished with Copenhaven, that's an old life. I'd rather everybody there forget about me. - Okay, okay. Hello? Hello? - Mommy, I'm coming as fast as I can. - I'm afraid I'm not your mommy. Look, we have a crossed line. Is there someone with you? - You know my mommy, Alan. - Listen, sweetheart, there must be a grownup person with you. - And I'll be coming soon. Please, don't go away. - Well, I'm getting a vocal jungle of crossed lines. - Here, let me try. - Mrs. Taswell, do you have the Per Simonsen file? Per Simonsen? - That was Bing and Randall. Yes, should be here somewhere. No. - Karin. Karin. - Alan, let me go. Let me go, Alan. Please, let me go, I must get away. - Calm down, my darling. I'm here. No one's gonna hurt you. No one. - Oh. Oh, thank God. Thank God. You won't let anyone hurt me? - Of course, I won't. - You'll always take care of me? - Of course I will, of course. Look here. What on Earth happened? - I'm not quite sure. But I'm all right, I suppose. Alan, please let me out. Alan? What was that service Tony was talking about? - Holy Communion? - Would it be all right to go? - Of course. - Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of Thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love Thee and worthily magnify Thy holy name, through Christ, Our Lord, amen. And we most humbly beseech thee of Thy goodness, Oh Lord, to comfort and sucker all them who, in this transitory life, are in trouble, need, or any other adversity. - That's not a miracle. - We also bless Thy holy name, for all Thy self in this life. - There's no where to go. - In Thy faith and fear. Jesus said unto his disciples, - I'm not afraid. - Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees. - Are you all right, darling? - You shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. You've heard that it was said, "Thou shalt not kill, and whosoever "shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment." But I say unto you, that whosever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of judgment. - Karin, let's leave. - Ye that do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins and intend to lead a new life following the commandments of God, draw near with faith, and take this Holy Sacrament for your comfort, and make your humble confession to Almighty God, meekly kneeling upon your knees. Come, for all things are now ready. The body of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy body and soul until everlasting life. The body of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy body and soul until everlasting life. The body of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy body and soul until everlasting life. The blood of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy body and soul until everlasting life. The blood of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, which was shed for thee, preserve thy body and soul until everlasting life. The blood of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, which was shed for thee, preserve thy body and soul until everlasting life. Karin. Thank you, if you'd return to your places. Here. Drink this. Oh, darling. Think of all our blessings. You're my beautiful Karin. The most wonderful lover in the world. You're going to have our baby. We have so much. Whatever's past is past. - It is not. Oh, God. I am so frightened. - But what of, Karin? You must tell me, it's what I'm here for. - Alan. Come here. What I have, I have. That could be Tony. - I brought the letters for you to sign. - You don't mean, you've come all this way? Oh, please, come in. - I typed them two or three times. I like to maintain high standards. Also, when you said clean enamel, I'm sure you meant- - Mrs. Taswell, can you hear a child crying? - No, I can't say I do, Mr. Desland. - It's outside, listen. - I can hear the swifts. - It stopped. Funny, it was a little way off, but quite distinct. - Children do cry, don't they. - Yes. There. See what I mean? You stay here, while I take a look. - No, I'd like to come with you, if I may. You never know. - It's over there, do you hear it? - Pooey. - She must have been playing here, run off. I'll drive you home, Mrs. Taswell. I'll just tell my wife. Oh, should I take the doll? - But I thought you'd got it, Mr. Desland. Darling, I'm running Mrs. Taswell home. Karin? Karin, Karin. - Alan, save me, save me. - Easy, she'll hear you. - You heard it, didn't you? - The little girl crying? Yes, we looked. There was no one there. Darling, don't worry, please. Now listen, I'm going to go downstairs, and I'm going to get Mrs. Taswell a cab, okay? Just stay here. All right? Dear Mr. Desland, there's not the least trouble to walk, the weather's fine, but there's high wind forecasted tonight. I'm glad to have done what I came to do. - Alan. I'm, not going to, not anymore, try to escape. Those are the symbols. I will, yes, keep my dignity. Don't go out. Shut the door. Alan, shut the door. - You know about this, don't you? You know why. - Yes. - There never was a child in the garden. - Perhaps, perhaps not. Don't go out. - Mrs. Taswell heard it. Karin, she heard it, too. - She didn't see it. - Oh, God. - Alan, take the car to go. There will be a lot. - I won't do that, Karin. I'm staying. I plan to tend to you. The wind's stopped. It won't be long now. You should be prepared, like me. Why don't you read the Bible? That wouldn't be out of place. Not out of this place. Listen. Tell me what you hear. Alan, tell me, can you hear it, or not? - Well yes, yes, I can hear it. - No, don't go. - But Karin, it could be someone. - No, I forbid you to go down. - It's light. Alan. I'm sorry. Will you do anything I ask? - Yes. - Then take me from here. - Magazine, Toy Department, 22nd of December. One green tortoise. This, too. But I've always known. - Are we far from the sea? - Heavens, no. Less than 10 miles, I should think. Do you want to go to the sea? - Yes. It would be lovely, the sea. - Oh, God have mercy. - You know, don't you? - Yes. - But you love me? Still? - Karin. - Wait. - I love you. - Do you love me? - My love. My love. - Alan. Karin. Karin. - Easy now, sir, I'll give you a hand. Now, what's your name, sir? - Desland. Alan Desland. - Is that your car? - Yes. - Did you see anything of a young lady on the beach or thereabouts? In the last hour or so? - Karin. Karin. - Easy now, that's it. She's down at the hospital, that's where she is. Please, tell me what happened. Some sort of trouble, was there? - I must see her. I must see my wife. - You wife? She's ill. - Yes, yes, she's ill. She's very ill. Now, you listen to me. You stay with me if you have to, but you take me to that hospital, do you understand me? Take me there. - That's where you're going, straight away. You need some treatment, yourself. I ought to tell you, sir, that if the lady does come 'round, I may have to take note of anything that's said. - Alan? - You ought to go now. - Nurse? - Excuse me, sir? I really am sorry to bother you like this, but what language was the lady speaking? - German. She's German by birth. - I see. - You mind telling me what she was saying? - I had no pity. - Did you know that your wife was pregnant? - We both felt fairly sure. - I see. Well, Mr. Desland, did you know that she had already borne a child? - Her child had died sometime before we were married. How did you know? - She had an episiotomy scar. Maybe she picked up some infection in the fallopian tubes. Then, the blockage could result in an ectopic pregnancy. Do you follow? Such a pregnancy can start by appearing normal. It's likely to rupture. Sexual intercourse can well bring it on. Once that happens, there's both pain and shock. - We gave you a sleeping pill, and you slept for 10 hours. - Karin. My wife. - I'm sorry, Mr. Desland. Your wife died during the night. I'd expect you'd like me to leave you now. - Oh, Karin, help me. Help me. - Well, we have heard evidence from Dr. Fraser, and also that of the police. And now, Mr. Desland, I have the duty to inquire into the circumstances attendant on your wife's death. And these, I'm sure you will agree, are unusual. You would agree, wouldn't you, that it is better that I ask questions now, rather than other people ask them later, behind your back? - Yes, sir. - Well, Mr. Desland, do you wish to give evidence? Do you wish to give evidence, Mr. Desland. - Yes, sir. I am most grateful, sir, for this opportunity to tell the court what took place. My wife, I think it would be fair to say, has a rather passionate temperament. Some might even say capricious. She's given to sudden turns of fancy, often without apparent motive. That day, we were looking for antiques, but what she really wanted was to go to the sea. On impulse, she suggested we go for a swim. The beach was deserted and, as you've learned already, sir, we later made love. Well, I can't help thinking that many people in similar circumstances have given expression to their natural feelings in that way. - You needn't extenuate that now, Mr. Desland. - Thank you, sir. Well, afterwards, we fell asleep. When I woke up, well, the police have already told you all that. - What she said in hospital, you will recall. I had no pity. Can you throw some light on that? - It's a quotation, sir, in German, that is from a minor poet. A queen speaking to her lover, whom she's exhausted by her demands. It's a sort of personal joke between us. Must have come into her head. - Thank you, Mr. Desland. That's all we shall require of you. - How did it happen? That Sunday, before coming to London, you and your daughter would have gone north, to Helsinger, I dare say, where the shore is more lonely, and the water deeper. You knew in Copenhagen what my reaction to the child would be. You knew that, like the seagull, your daughter had to die. Oh, Karin, you blamed yourself, but it was me. My need for a tidy life. Well, beloved, your secret is safe with me. I'd do anything, give anything, for one more hour with you. - Alan. - Karin? Karin.
