You Tube - Video Running Time 02:17:18 You Tube search name - 12 O'Clock 1958 - Where are you going? - None of your business. Strange! All this while everything you did was my business. Now it's not? Anyway, tell me why you're going. What is wrong? What happened? Ask yourself that before asking me. I only know that after your uncle's demise... we gave you every possible luxury. - And fulfilled all your wishes. - Oh yes, you did! I wanted to study. You made me give up college. Made me beg for every penny. Meet this one, don't meet that. This is bad, that's good. Taunted me all the time! Is this what you call the luxury you gave me? That's not my fault. I followed your sister's orders. Sure. You're a wax doll. You can be molded in any way. - You do everything sister says, don't you? - You're crossing all limits. Creating new problems everyday! - I'll have to complain to her. - She too is dead for me! - Bani! - She hasn't once written to me since she went to Bombay 7 months ago. I don't want to see your faces! It's you? Come in. It's late night. These bags? - Had another row? - Yes. I've left that house. Now I'll never go back. You don't have to. I always told you to come and stay here. You'll be away from him and my time will pass. - But you... - I'd have come long ago... but I was waiting to find a job. - Job? - Yes, uncle. I've got a job. I begin work tomorrow. Bravo! You're really my niece... who stands on her own feet. Gentlemen, you've honored me by electing me Managing Director. I thank you for the same. I hope you'll help me in managing this job at the earliest. We can offer you very little help except for finances. And we have no knowledge of the hotel industry. Don't you worry. I assure you our hotels will soon be the talk of the entire nation. We mustn't delay depositing the money. We should begin work immediately. My investment is nominal. Take it anytime you wish. Mr. Rai is the one who has to arrange for the maximum capital. Don't worry. It will be arranged within the month. All right, we'll take leave. - All of you, please come. - Let's go upstairs. Goodness gracious! Look at your style Who has ever seen lightning laugh or the flames sing? Goodness gracious! Your eyes flutter demurely as they meet mine And the magic stops and starts Whoever has a heart within his breast... how will he control himself? My! These glances These fluttering arms My heart tells me something untoward will happen today Goodness gracious! Look at your style Who has ever seen lightning laugh or flames sing? Goodness gracious! You cast your glance ever so slightly towards me Spoke but a little to me Upon such coquetry My heart wavered and trembled Every gathering was wounded and restless My heart tells me something untoward will happen today Goodness gracious! Look at your style Who has seen lightning laugh and the flames sing? Goodness gracious! When your gaze entangles that of every member of the audience When your hair is dishevelled in the middle of the night The darkness spreads And devastation arrives My heart tells me something untoward will happen today Goodness gracious! Look at your style Who has seen lightning laugh and the flames sing? Goodness gracious! That's terrific! Outstanding! You haven't seen the dancer who was here before. She'd make you forget everything. - Mr. Rai, where is she these days? - She's on a break. Permit us to leave. It's late. - So early? - You're free these days. Your wife is out of town. But we have to face the home government. - Okay. - Good night. Take a seat. - Yes? - Regarding my case... - The next date is December. - Thank you. - The fees... - Don't worry about money. Find some loophole to defeat Tolaram Damdimal. Don't worry. Arrange for the money and all will be done. The money will reach court tomorrow. - Good day. - Good day. - Don't forget. - No. - He must be defeated. - Yes, it will be done. Your name? - Bani Choudhary. - Aha! Understood. Divorce case. Smt. Bani Choudhary. Work... - Your husband's name? - Pardon? You brought it written it down. You're shy, perhpas? Give it to me. You're the new secretary? Follow me. This is your seat. - Have you worked before this? - No. I'll make you perfect in two days. First, arrange these letters case wise in these files. This is... murder. File 302. This case is of rioting. Number 147. This is cheating. One man needed everywhere! - Sorry. - It's alright. Moti! Moti! Moti! Does it hurt you to address me by my full name? Do consider our old friendship and my position. Why'd you call me? Mr. Motilalji Sharma... This is Court Session and that is flat S2. A 40-year-old bald man lives here. Do I have to count his son's hair? Let me finish. This man is blackmailing the Parsi who just left. I want you to go there and find out where he goes, what he does. - Understand? - Yes. - Take this. - Shall I go tomorrow? - Don't be daft. Hurry. And send in the secretary. You're being called. A problem everyday! Follow this one or that. Follow this cripple, or that blind man. Go there at night and come here during the day. What a pain! Now he wants me to follow a bald man! I'm fed up of this job. Put me on duty elsewhere. You're very impatient. Why don't you think there's no better place... than this to learn about the gang of smugglers. You can see the flat clearly and Ajay is your childhood friend. So you have every liberty. What liberty? I haven't seen a movie for 3 months! This lawyer is comparable to Scotland Yard. He's got the problems of the world! And I'm the one who faces the music! Have you no shame pulling down my sari? I didn't pull it down. It was drawn to me. It fell into my arms the moment it saw me. - Whose is it? - Mine. Yours? You need to punish it severely. It's not good to be so kind to loafers. Why are you embarrassing me? I scolded you by mistake. - Do you always make such mistakes? - Pardon? Sometimes. You scolded me just now. When will you make the mistake of being nice? - Pardon? - Answer me. What are you doing here? I was being scolded and she was making mistakes. My dear, he's a gentleman. Don't make a mistake with him. This is Bani, my niece and he is Ajay, an advocate. A famous lawyer of the city. - Glad to meet you. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Let's play some chess. - Sure. - Come along. I'm glad we met. The evening will pass. Bani can't play chess! It requires brains. Otherwise she's very bright. She's private secretary to a lawyer. Is that so? My sympathies to the lawyer. Here you are. So that's your game. Want to win the game? No question. I've lost in the very first move. This is a very dangerous game. One move decides the entire game. Yes. Save yourself. You're being checked. I see that. Make your move. Here you are. I've lost myself somewhere here The season is young, the night, beautiful Where's my heart? Who knows? I don't even know where I am I'm lost... I'm lost... I encountered somone by chance... that my heart cried out, 'Support me!' I wonder what those beautiful eyes were saying I've lost myself somewhere here The season is young, the night, beautiful Where's my heart? Who knows? I don't even know where I am I'm lost... I'm lost... Let me express my feelings indirectly... by caressing her hair lovingly Then I think, what if she's displeased? I've lost myself somewhere here The season is young, the night, beautiful Where's my heart? Who knows? I don't even know where I am I'm lost... I'm lost... This melody of love... will definitely be mine one day Be still, my heart, my heart, don't be so wilful I've lost myself somewhere here The season is young, the night, beautiful Where's my heart? Who knows? I don't even know where I am I'm lost... I'm lost... Your good name? My name is... is Miss Natasundari, Chuna Bhatti Juna Khar, address. Chuna Bhatti, Juna Khar. - What is your case? - What can I say? My landlord gave me notice to leave the house. - Why? - He can't sleep. - Why? - His heart gets a jolt. - You give it? I only dance. - You dance? - Yes. I'll give you a demonstration. - That's quite enough. - Did you like it? I'm feeling great. But my landlord doesn't like it. - I'll talk to him. You may leave. - Really? - Should I leave? - Yes, go. - Good day, sir. - Good bye. What about your case? Is this the time to come? Is now the time to come to the office? It's 2 minutes past 10:30. The court doesn't believe in sorry. If you're late, the work won't be done, we'll lose the case, and he'll be hanged! And who'll save him if he's condemned to hang? You or your apology? Forget the apology. We have lots of work. What, Mr. Pestonjee, those... I mean to say, have you bought all your papers? Gave it up. I can see everything. I thought you could only see girls through these, not men. Meaning? Meaning, your secretary is very nice. The first day she captured the office, the next, the heart. Don't bore me. My getting bored is fine but it shouldn't reach a stage... - that you get bored of clients. - May I come in? Here's your mail and this is your personal letter. It's urgent. Mr. Ajay Kumar, the Rs.200 is your fees. I don't consider it appropriate to come to your office. Hence, be kind enough to meet me at the Hotel Majestic this evening. I'll be wearing a white sari. - Did you write this letter to me? - Yes. I am Mrs. Kapoor. And you...? I'm Ajay Kumar and this is Bani Choudhary, my secretary. - Would you like something? - No thanks. - So, Mrs. Kapoor, you wrote... - Yes, I troubled you because... for the past three years, my husband's property... - Hello, Bani. - Hello. - I've to admire your anger. You didn't give me a chance to speak then. Has your temper cooled down? Sir, there's a trunk call from Delhi. Stay here. I'll be back. Don't go away. - How are you, darling? - Very well, but dying to meet you both. I want to come back. It's so hot here that I can't bear it. I was thinking of leaving by the morning train. Maya, I may have to come to Delhi on business in a day or two. I would like you to stay there for a couple of days. We could return together. The journey will be fun. Okay, I'll stay back if you say so. But I hope I won't be waiting in vain... and you'll make some excuse, as always. Such impatience! No, darling, I will come. Okay, then I'll wait for you. Don't worry. I've heard the case. - I'll start the proceedings tomorrow. - Thank you. Good bye. Sinha? You, here? What are you doing here? I'm always here. Where are you these days? Right here, my friend, but I have no spare time. - Excuse me... - I can see that. - Did you make this sketch? - Yes. Like it? Keep it. You're a strange guy! My studio is two feet away from your office. Come over sometime. He's a good man. - He's very charming. - Of course. How long have you known him? He's your friend. How will I know? But he has made a nice sketch. - I'm not talking about Sinha. - Who, then? That man who was talking to you so casually at the hotel. He? He is... - That was Rai Mohan. - You've known him a long while, huh? Yes, from childhood. Very handsome man. Of course. He has brains too. Why didn't you answer him? - I'm not talking to him. - Why? That's between us. Who are you to ask? Why are you quiet? That's my choice. Who are you to ask? What a spell you have cast, my love I've lost my heart to you No one should steal hearts like you do See how helpless I've become Oh, goodness gracious... Oh, goodness gracious, your eyes beckoned... and I lost my heart to you What a spell you have cast, my love I've lost my heart to you What a spell... My steps falter as I walk along How can I control myself when you tease me? I walk... I walk, with your name on my lips I've lost my heart to you What a spell you have cast, my love I've lost my heart to you What a spell... There's yet a little prudence, but I'm slightly befuddled too There's an ache, but there's delight too The arrow, my beloved... You shot such a wondrous dart, my beloved... that I've lost my heart to you What a spell you have cast, my love I've lost my heart to you What a spell... I came to wish you good night. Oh, darling! You've arrived! What's the matter? Come in. This is my friend, Khanna. He was on the same flight. - This is my wife, Maya. - Hello. Please come in. Excuse me. I must keep my bags in my room. - Oh, so you're staying in this hotel too? - Yes. Room 302. - Okay, let me take your leave. - Khanna, do have lunch with us. - What do you say, darling? - Alright. - How is Bani? - She's fine. She's very unkind. She hasn't replied to a single letter of mine. You know how irresponsible she is. She must have forgotten. Let me meet her. Then I'll teach that witch a lesson. - When can we leave here? - Soon. I have some work here. Then I'll book the seats. - What work do you have here? - I need money for business. - Money? - Yes, darling. You won't give me a penny from your inheritance. And I have to beg from others. You say such strange things. Dad's money is meant for something specific. How can I give it to you? All right, have it your way. Anyway, I've made arrangements. Oh, it's 10 o'clock. That man must be waiting for me. I must leave, darling. I'll be back by lunch. - Have some breakfast at least. - It's a very important appointment. I'll be back by lunch. Listen, book our tickets. Hello, Neena! Hello, Maya. - How are you? - Ayah, go out. Neena, Maya is going to Bombay tomorrow. You must go with her. Here's your ticket. Here. Your seats are in the same compartment. Pay attention to one thing, darling; the child should be with Maya all the time. She loves kids because she can't have them. - But... - No buts, darling. The moment the train reaches Dadar, leave the child and disembark. And... be careful. I don't know why I'm scared. A life, for no reason... Now, don't be silly, darling. This is life and one must use one's head, not heart. After a few days, your son will be a millionaire. And you, you'll be mine. You invited me and came late. Forgive me; I'm late. - I'm sorry, darling. - Come on. - Booked the tickets? - No, darling. I have to go to Calcutta. - Calcutta? - Yes. The man I was to meet has gone to Calcutta. Go from Bombay? No, darling. It's imperative that I meet him. I've to meet him today itself, or my work will suffer. So must I rot here till then? Let your enemies rot! Why don't you return alone tomorrow? By the time your train reaches Bombay, I'll be there by air. Hey, Khanna, why don't see her to the train tomorrow? - What's so difficult about that? - I'll take sister-in-law to the station. - I think that's a good arrangement. What do you say? - As you wish. Don't pull a long face now. I'll soon be in Bombay with you. What are you looking for? I'm looking to see what you've hidden in your purse. Be my guest. There's nothing in there that belongs to the office. If I find something from my house? What do you have in your house worth stealing? Some dusty books, and a maid to dust them. You are right, Bani. What's there in my house? It's empty. And I live in it, totally lost. How did you get this sickness? - Thanks to you. - How is that? - It's the effect of your company. - Then, leave me alone. When you became my fellow-traveler... my life changed course Thousands of lamps have lit up... the path of my love I was delighted, with the intoxication... of your lips, colored as they are by the hues of spring The seasons are young, my companion is handsome and his glances signal his favors All the hues and shades of colors... have now melded with your eyes Thousands of lamps have lit up... the path of my love Whither the destination? Where's the caravan? In your embrace lies my whole world Come, my beloved, let's go where... the skies meet the earth on the horizon We have gone way past... our journey's end today Thousands of lamps have lit up... the path of my love When you became my fellow-traveler... my life changed course Thousands of lamps have lit up... the path of my love - Going to ask for his permission? - Who is he to give permission? - Then why are you going? - I have work. - What? Tell you later. This is a map of platform 5. According to you, Maya's compartment is the third. I'll bring Bani there under some pretext. We'll stand here. There's a bench about two feet away. You stand on this bench. You'll be able to aim easily from here. But keep one thing in mind. The moment the train halts, finish your job, and jump off this fence. I'll have a motorcycle waiting for you here. lts number is 5500. - 5500. Understood? - Yes. - Er... look... Here's your money... and take this. Remember, you mustn't miss. - Khanna never misses. - Good, good! Govind, Madam is coming with the child tonight. Take the car and bring Ms. Bani. - She's not home right now. - Wait there for her until she returns. But sir, Ms. Bani is waiting at home. - What did you say? - She's waiting inside. Hello, Bani, you're well? Hmmm. I'm glad you've gotten over your anger. Where's your luggage? I haven't come to stay. I've come for the money uncle left me in his will. Oh. So that's it. You're become very smart. You found your own bridegroom? - Tell me about him. - It's none of your business! Why are you fighting? I only wanted to know the name of the young man who tamed this lioness. I haven't come to crack jokes. I came for the money. Who's joking? Bani, you know only your sister can disburse the money. She's coming by the midnight train. Meet her. - Where are you going? - To the station to meet her. I, too, am going there. Come with me. 25 minutes to go. Arre, what's this? See what movie is playing here. Good gracious! The poor fellow's dead. - What happened? - What a terrible accident! No, no, no! I did not kill my sister. The circumstances and the law are against you. Tell us the truth. Who's your accomplice who fired the second shot? I have no accomplice. I don't know anybody! You do know him! - How much did you pay him? - I didn't pay anyone! I've no accomplice. How many times must I say that I didn't kill my sister? Why don't you... call Mr. Ajay? Constable, take her away. - Hello? Ajay speaking. - Inspector Rane, Agripada police station. What a bore!! Is this any time to wake me up? Anyway, tell me. Ajay, do you know Miss Bani Choudhary? Bani? Yes, of course. She's my secretary. She's been arrested for murder. - Murder? Whose murder? - Her sister's. I didn't kill anyone, Ajay. I'd gone with my brother-in-law to meet her at the station. I don't know how the pistol wound up in my purse. And it went off. I didn't commit the murder, Ajay. I didn't kill her. I'll look after everything, Bani. But tell me the truth. What? Don't you believe me either? It doesn't matter if I believe you, Bani; you have to be proved innocent. Tell me the truth. Where did you get the pistol? I don't know, Ajay! I don't know. Where did you go after leaving me? Straight to brother-in-law's house. Then to the station to meet my sister. But you never told me your sister was coming? Where did I know? My brother-in-law told me. - Who else did you meet? - Nobody at all. Nobody? Don't worry, Bani. I'll free you. But I still can't believe Bani is capable of murder. Only because she's your friend's beloved? No, lnspector. I know her quite well. - She's a simple girl. - That could be a personal opinion. But if she's really committed a murder, do you know your duty? Yes, I do. The bullet found in Mrs. Rai Mohan's body was not fired from this pistol. Hey, drive slowly. Drive slowly, I say! - Why? What's the matter? - Something will happen soon if it hasn't already. Look here, this guy had the same disease as you do. I mean, he wanted to reach home in a hurry, but reached God's abode instead. Understood? If he wanted to die with Rs.5500, he could've willed it to me. So the cash that went into a government bank would have been in my pocket. Eh? Very good! That man resembles me. - Your face resembles that of a monkey as well. - Resembles grapes?! - Langoor! (Monkey.) - I thought you meant grapes. It's the season. Monkey. But yet... my late wife and I loved Bani very much. I don't understand anything. Why did Bani do such a crazy thing? Who was it who fired the second shot? Second bullet? What are you saying? Yes, your wife was shot twice. Only one shot was fired from Bani's pistol. - But who could that be? - That's what we want to know. But... if there was another person... someone at the station would have seen him. No. Do you suspect any of Bani's friends? As long as Bani lived here, I never saw her meet anyone like that. But after leaving us, obviously, I can't say. You'd mentioned earlier that Bani was strangely quarrelsome. Did your wife and Bani ever quarrel? Small arguments take place in every family, lnspector. But... nothing serious. As far as I know. Mr. Rai, did Bani ever come here after she left? Just once. That, too, on that ill-omened night that she shot her sister. Why'd she come? Only she knows. But... all she told me was that she had come for the money... that her uncle had willed her. A will? May I see it? Why not? Of course. I'll get it. Here, look. This is the will that hides the secret behind the murder. It clearly says... that "My only daughter Maya will be the sole heir to my property." "And her children after her demise." "But if Maya dies without issue... my niece Bani will inherit everything." Milord, I shall now prove that the accused shot Maya for the property. Because when she shot Mrs. Maya she didn't know that... that Mrs. Maya's child, the true heir to this wealth was already born. Inspector Chauhan, how many bullets hit Maya? Two. One in the chest, the other simply grazed her ear. How many shots were fired at the time of the murder? Only two. Did you see both shots being fired? No. I only heard the first shot. When I turned around, I saw the accused firing the second shot. Isn't it possible that she fired the first shot, too? No. When I confiscated her pistol, I found only one shot had been fired. A second person fired the second shot from another gun. - Right? - Yes. How long after the first shot was the second fired? Barely a second later. In fact, even less. So that means the accused was already lifting her hand to shoot? Yes. - Are you the ballistic expert? - Yes. You reported that the bullet found in the deceased Maya's body... wasn't fired from the pistol held by the accused, Bani. - Right? - Yes. Which pistol was in the accused's hands at the time of the murder? - .38. - .38. And the bullet found in Mrs. Maya's body was fired from what pistol? .38. Can you easily obtain .38 pistols in this country? No. The license is not usually provided to the common man. Milord, two killers fired two shots at Mrs. Maya with two different pistols. These pistols were of the same make, and were fired almost simultaneously. At the same target. Doesn't this prove, Milord... that both these killers were part of the same conspiracy? - Any questions? - No. You may leave. Now I will prove, Milord, who profited from this murder. The accused, Bani, or the other killer. And to prove this, I begin with a strange witness... who probably knew about the murder at a time... when the real killers hadn't even thought of it. I think this bald man will crucify Bani. - Professor Swami... - You forgot 'Muthu'. Call me Muthuswami. -Professor Muthuswami, are you an astrologer? Yes, my ancestors were also astrologers. Meaning you have predicted the destiny of generations. 'Mukhtabdil'? What does that mean? I've heard of the Hindu Code, but what is this new bill? - Order! Order! - I wish to know if you predict the future? For a fee of Rs.501, sir. Last year, after accepting Rs.501, you'd written something about Maya's future. Something? You call this 'something'? Just read it and see. 28 March. Within a month, Maya will suffer a tragic train or road mishap. But she will escape. It's definite. - What else is written? - It's also written... that for a year from that date, she will be in danger... of losing her life at the hands of a near relative. If she escapes, she will only die after bearing five children. If she had escaped, couldn't she have borne 5 kids? Is this merely 'something'? Mr. Rai Mohan, did Prof. Swamy's firs prediction come true? Yes. A month after this prediction, we narrowly escaped a car accident. According to the second prediction, Maya was in danger from a close relative. Other than Bani, did she have any other close relative? Er... no. But we never suspected poor Bani. But we were worried that it might happen by accident. So I sent my wife out of the city for the predicted period of danger. Then why did you bring her back before the year was up? The fact is, that period would have ended at midnight. And her train was to arrive at midnight. I didn't realise what could happen in just a few seconds. You had a child when your wife was away in Delhi. Did Bani know about this? No. We'd decided not to tell anyone until this period was over. At the time of the murder, the accused Bani didn't know that Maya had a child. She only knew that in the absence of a child, after Maya... she would inherit the property. - That's all, Milord. - Does the defense want to interrogate the witness? Yes, Milord. Mr. Rai Mohan, did you love your wife? - Yes. - How much? A lot. If you loved her so much, why didn't you hate her killer? Er, that... what are you implying, counselor? I want to state that you are committing perjury in court. You're a conman. If Bani really killed your wife, why are you pretending to love her? My love is not false. I feel pity for her naivete. There are some people in this world... who present their right cheek when slapped on the left. Try facing my slaps! I'll slap you so hard that both your cheeks will smart. - Order, order! - Mr. Rai Mohan... how many days before the murder was your child born? About a month. Why? If Bani had known you had a child, would she have killed? - Perhaps... perhaps not. - Then why hide it from her? I hid nothing from her. Bani herself stopped meeting me. So I never had the opportunity to tell her anything. But you'd an opportunity that night? Bani came to you a few hours before the murder. Yes. And Maya and the child were due to arrive in a few hours. Would it have been better to tell Bani, or to surprise her with the child? What do you think? - Mr. Rai Mohan, have you owned a pistol? - No. - How long has Bani lived with you? - From her childhood. When she was with you, how many hours a day would she stay home? - About 17-18 hours. - The rest of the time? - In school. - Did the school teach her to shoot? - No. - According to your statement, in a crowded station... she shot amidst the crowd. She shot at a woman inside a slowing train. - Right? - Yes. A woman who shoots under these circumstances... must either be a great marksman, or absolutely crazy. Do you think Bani is mad? No. Just a good marksman. When she never learned to shoot at your house, or at school... where did she learn to shoot? I object, Milord. The defence counsel's question is irrelevant. I don't think so. Only a good marksman can commit this crime. - Not anyone else. - We will prove that too, Milord. Your question is only where the accused learned to shoot. For many months she has worked as secretary to the defense counsel. Whatever it is, I request the court to give us time to gather evidence. Granted. You have 15 days. The question is why was she killed at a crowded station? She wasn't allowed to reach home. It's possible the killer didn't want Mrs. Rai Mohan to meet or talk to anyone. Meaning Mrs. Rai knew some secret... that might be dangerous for the killer. Absolutely! That is why she was killed at the station, before getting home. If that were so, then why wasn't she killed in Delhi? Assume this murder took place in Delhi. Then... Then our secretary wouldn't be trapped... and we would have been spared. So the murder happened in Bombay to frame Bani. But what's the reason for her murder? Only Mrs. Rai Mohan and her killer know the motive. But Mrs. Rai Mohan can't talk because the poor woman is dead. And the killer doesn't want to die. I think something happened in Delhi that caused the murder. The child was born in Delhi. - Child... - Yes, Mrs. Rai Mohan's. Yes! Brilliant, Moti, brilliant! For once, you said something sensible. I'm always sensible, but you've realized it for the first time. Hello? Indian Airlines? - Please book me a seat for Delhi. - Delhi? It's beyond your comprehension. You handle Rai Mohan here. Hello? Yes? Ajay. Ajay Kumar. Uh... 88491. Yes. Payment? Got a good customer. - Hello, Mr. Motilal. - Hello. - K. Kapoor. Mrs. K. Kapoor? - Please come in. - Thank you. Tell me, how far has the case progressed? The case is getting more and more confusing by the day. But Mr. Ajay said there's no reason to worry. Everything is fine but we can't find the killer. Killer? But what's the killer got to do with my case? Uh... er... Your case? That's on the 8th. Where's your ayah? So that's your killer. Er... not the killer but a step towards finding the killer. I want to ask her some questions. So it would be extremely kind of you to call her. - Rosie! Rosie! - Please ask her not to tell anyone about my queries. Listen, this man is a good friend of mine. Whatever he asks you, don't tell anyone else. Understood? Rosie, who's the girl who came with you from the milk center? She's Marina, my childhood friend. Oh, so she's a childhood friend? And who were her childhood friends? Eh? Don't you remember? Try and recall, Rosie. Or my Rosie will be in trouble. Where have I gone? I've come to meet my Marina. - To meet Marina? - Yes. - But that's me. You? Strange! When did you grow up? This child... is yours? No, it's my master's. He just left in the car. And the woman with him? Is she his sister? She's not his sister, but his sweetheart. But who're you to ask? - You don't recognize your John D'Souza? - John? You're so grownup? - Yes. - Where's the mole on your nose? I'd been rubbing my nose for the past 10 years...

Look towards me, my beauty... - Hello? - 241404? - Speaking please. - Trunk call for Mr. Motilal, from Delhi. - Put him on. - Hello? Hello, Moti, Ajay here. - Hello, Ajay. Found anything new? Not a thing. Everything is as Rai Mohan testified. I even went to the maternity home. I'm now at the hotel she stayed in. But there's nothing suspicious here. - Tell me, did you find anything? - Just a letter. Addressed to Mrs. Rai Mohan redirected from Grand Hotel. What? Hotel Grant? Just read out the whole address. Mrs. Rai Mohan, Room 301, Hotel Grant, Delhi. Hotel Grant? - Yes, please? - Was a Mrs. Rai Mohan staying here a few days ago? Just a moment, please. Yes, Mrs. Maya Rai Mohan. She left on 27th March after a stay of 7 months. - Did she bear a child? - Child? No. She didn't have any child. - No child? - No. Can you tell me what kind of people came to meet her? As far as I know, she lived alone. Er, Ahmed, you were on duty in 301 last month, weren't you? - Yes sir. I was on duty. - Who visited Mrs. Rai Mohan? No one at all. Oh, two men visited her two days before she left the hotel. One man left that same day; the other stayed in an adjacent room. They ate together and finally left together. - What was his name? - Mr. Khanna. - Can you describe him? - Who can forget his face, sir? A round-faced man, with bushy eye brows and piercing eyes... thin lips, a moustache like a hero, and a deep scar near his left eye. Come, you've been called to the office. Come, Bani. Ajay, I feel like I'll suffocate within these walls. - And then, you never visited me. - I've been running around day and night. Don't lose heart. Everything will be fine. I've come to see you today; Soon, I'll come to take you away. - When? - Very soon. Okay, Bani, tell me, was your sister pregnant before she left for Delhi? She never mentioned it. - Do you have a relative named Khanna? - Khanna? - No. - A friend of your sister's or brother-in-law's? - As far as I know, no one. - Try to remember. He has a deep scar near his left eye. A scar? I've never seen anyone like that. - At the station? - Not even there. How is he related to the case? Okay, Bani. - Hello, Sinha. - Oh, come in, come in. How did you come by here today? - You can relax, Ms. Margarita. - Thank you. - Tell me, what's new? Sinha, I wanted to know if a man's portrait can be made without seeing him? I mean, just by the description of his features. Why not? I've sketched one such portrait myself. - You? - Yes, me. Would you like to see it? - Yes. Where is it? - Come with me. The girl is my friend's beloved. I made this by asking him to describe her. - What does your friend say? - He feels it resembles the girl. - Why are you asking? - I too want to get a portrait made. - Whose? - Mr. Khanna's. - Who is Mr. Khanna? - He'd stayed at the Grand Hotel, Delhi, a few days ago. There's a waiter called Ahmed over there. He remembers Mr. Khanna well. Here's the address. Go to Delhi today. - Who is that firecracker? - Neena Devi. - Meena Devi? - Yes, she's our famous dancer. Famous dancer and I've no clue? Strange. So come over in the evening. There's a grand program. - It's opening night. - Is that so? She's dancing again for the first time in 7 months. - Oh, so she made others dance to her tune then? - No, she was on leave. Oh... Okay, you may also leave. Hello? Ajay isn't here. Oh, you're back? You're a strange man. Why did you end the call yesterday? My head is still spinning. I am worried, too, Moti. Why? What happened? There were 2 Mrs. Rai Mohans in Delhi. Two? Then this is the third. Friend, there's another one plotting to be Mrs. Rai Mohan. - Don't joke. - Who's joking? I've seen her myself. She goes to his house every day. - Who's she? - Neena. - Neena? Neena, who? - A dancer in Mr. Rai Mohan's hotel. - How long has she been here? - 6-7 days. - Where was she before this? - On leave for 6-7 months. Oh, my dear, do listen... It seems you didn't recognize me I'd given you my heart On this very day, at this very time 'tis not right, this infatuation Why are you sitting here, so silent and quiet? Why are you so distanced from my love? Tell me, why are you so distant? Oh, my dear, do listen... It seems you didn't recognize me I'd given you my heart On this very day, at this very time Try to recall and you'll remember... that magical moonlight, the slumbering clouds on the moon the slumbering clouds, the lost breezes Oh, my dear, do listen... it seems you didn't recognize me I'd given you my heart On this very day, at this very time From the time your eyes fell on me My heart and soul have been wounded You sit here, all-knowing Recognising that, and aware of everthing Oh my dear, do listen... it seems you didn't recognize me I'd given you my heart On this very day, at this very time - But why do you want to kidnap the child? - Simple. There were 2 Mrs. Rai Mohans in Delhi. Only one of them can be the real mother. And if she's alive, we'll know the moment the child vanishes. Because a mother is a mother. But where will you keep the infant? - That's my responsibility. - Okay, then, but do be careful. Don't you worry. - John, why have you come so late? - My beloved, I've come to arrest you. Give me your hand. - Am I a thief? - A great one. - What have I stolen? - My heart. Why would I steal your heart? You must have lost it somewhere. Give your statement in court but I will arrest you. - How will you arrest me? - Shall I tell you? Like this... - What is this? - Love handcuffs that arrests 2 hearts. Engagement ring! - How sweet of you! - Aww... You're so naughty. I thought the baby was crying. - I must leave. - So early? I have arrange for the wedding, no? - In the night? - Why delay a good deed? Alright, I've to go. - When will we meet next? - At the same time, tomorrow. Okay, bye. - Govind, have you taken the baby? - No. - Isn't he in the room? - No. He's not there. Hello? Hotel Majestic? I'm calling from the house. Please call the master. - There's a call for Rai saheb. - Right. - Sir, there's a phone call from the house. - From the house? Excuse me. - Hello? Sir, this is Marina. Marina? What's it? - Baby... baby... - Why are you stuttering? What's the matter? - The baby has disappeared. - What?? - The baby has disappeared. - Where the hell were you? Hello, darling. Tell me, did you like the dance? Why? Why are you silent? - Come with me. - Where? Just come with me. I'll tell you on the way. Come on. Who's that? Oh, it's you, sir. Come in, please come in. You ran away the other day. Today, I won't let you escape. But today, I haven't come here so I can run away. - Really? - Yes. - Then do sit down. - So happy? - Yes. Oh, oh, sorry! - Oh, be careful. Hope you're not hurt. - No. - So you agreed with what I said? - What did you say? What did I say? What do you mean? Marriage. You ran away the other day without answering me. Today, let me see how you escape. What do I lack? Nothing... nothing at all. Sharp eyes, curly hair... luscious lips, fair skin. A graceful body as delicate as a rose... as intoxicating as wine. Anyone who drinks in your beauty will never regain his senses. And the best part is that you dance so well... that the god of dance himself would be embarrassed. Devi... the name fits perfectly. I'd love to marry you. But I'm helpless. I'm already married. - You're married? - Yes. Then what will happen to me? - Hey, why are you crying? - She's no more. - Who? - Wife. - Then... - No, darling... I don't want to ruin the life of an innocent girl like you. You're unmarried and I'm the father of a child. Doesn't matter. Wow, wonderful! Darling, you're great. Prabhakar, bring the child. My dear son, you are very fortunate. You found yourself a mother and a wife for your father. Take care of him. I have just one child. - Okay, I'll take your leave. - Again? Okay, you may go. The child is with me. So you will return. - Definitely. - Say bye to Papa. - You're saying bye? - Bye-bye! - How did the child vanish? - I don't know, sir. 'I don't know!' Where were you? I'd just come down, sir. You wretch! Why did you come down, leaving the child alone? I'd come down to get the baby's milk. - Had anyone come home? - No one, sir. Then did a ghost take him? How did he vanish with both of you around? - I don't know, sir. - You idiot! Look, Govind, tell me honestly who came here. - I'll give you what you want. - I didn't see anyone come in, sir. Oh, shut up! Now hear this. If anyone finds out the baby is missing, I'll cut your tongue. Now get out! - Whom are you calling? - The police. Be sensible, Neena. You may be the child's mom, but to the world, I'm the father. And his mother was murdered. - I don't care. Please let me call the police. - Neena! Why don't you understand? If the cops discover the truth, we will be hanged. You're only worried about yourself. - What if... what if... my baby is harmed... - Neena. I care more for him than myself. Whatever I did, I did for him. Then what's wrong with you now? Why don't you inform the police? Try and understand. I don't want to listen to anything. I'm shocked that you don't understand. Look, darling, if we complain to the cops, the kidnappers will be warned. And his life will be in danger. Then, my baby... will he never be found? - My baby! My baby... - He'll be found, darling. Proceed with caution. Someone surely suspects us. And look, darling, don't let anyone know your child has been kidnapped. Or that you're upset. - Looked at these carefully? - Yes, sir, I did. Then, describe Mr. Khanna's eyes, lips, eyes and chin. His eyes were like these, and this resembles his chin... and his lips looked like these. His nose was either this... or that. It was somewhat in between these two. - What do you think? - This looks exactly like Mr. Khanna. But you didn't draw his moustache. - Moustache? - Yes. - What sort of moustache? - Like a hero's. Like this? There was a deep scar here. Hello? Recognize it? It's your child's voice. My baby! You mean, Mr. Rai Mohan's child, don't you? You would know better. Look, I want to talk only to the child's mother. If that's not you, then let's end this call. Hello? Hello... Who are you? Hello? Hello... I... I'm the child's mother. Since you've acknowledged this, tell us the rest and take your baby back. But who are you? Where do I come? Balkrishna Nivas, Parsi Colony, Dadar. And listen, if you try any tricks... or tell anyone, your child will suffer. Hello? Yes? - Hotel Majestic speaking. - Hotel Majestic? - Look, give the line to Miss Neena. - She has gone out, sir. - Gone out? When? - I don't know. She'd received a call. Telephone? - What are you doing here? - I... was going to the hotel. Come, I'm going there myself. This chap got the better of us. If you agree, shall I try it my way? - Hello! - Hello! - Here you go, pal. Here's your Mr. Khanna. I drew him exactly as the hotel boy described. Now it's up to you. I've surely seen this man somewhere. - Where have you seen him? - Wait a sec, let me think and I'll tell you. Where have I seen him? In a car? On a train? - On a bus? - In court? - No. - At Rai Mohan's hotel? - No. - At the police station? - No. - In a picture house? - A-ha! Remove 'house'. In a picture. See, Ajay, this is the same man... who, coincidentally, on the night of the murder, met his maker. The police are still searching for his antecedents. Neena, there is only one person who will share your joys and sorrows. And that's me. If you keep secrets even from me, I dread our future life together. Why don't you tell me? What's the matter? - What's wrong with you? - I don't understand anything! What do I do? Where do I go? I'm beginning to hate myself... you, everything! - Get away from me! - Are you mad? No. Today I'm not mad. I was mad the day I was taken in by your promise of marriage. And became your mistress, dancing in your hotel. I was mad the day... - I placed my innocent child in your murderous arms. - Neena! Why are you talking so irrationally? Someone has definitely misled you. Someone has definitely misinformed you. - Tell me who it was. Who was it? - Nobody misled me! - Tell me! - No one at all! Neena, Neena, darling, forgive me. I'm as worried as you are. Perhaps you don't know that they telephoned me too. They said they would return the child if we confess the truth. - Why don't you tell them then? - How can I, Neena, how can I? We'll be hanged and Bani will inherit everything. And our child? Helpless, our child will die of starvation! - Is this what you want? - Why don't you inform the cops? - Take their help? - Police! Police! Police! Stop talking about the police! Don't you understand they will kill the baby before the cops reach? Then you won't find your baby's corpse, let alone your baby. If you still insist, then go ahead, call the cops. Your madness will kill the baby. Operator, please get me the direct line. Take this. Here! But remember, if the baby is harmed... you'll be responsible. Darling, trust me. I'm trying my best. Your child will be found. Give me some time. I repeat, think again. This concerns the gutter. There's no time for caution. Do what you have to do. Take this. Be careful. - Hello, constable. - Got a match? - Oh... here. That's a good lighter. Where did you steal it from? I didn't steal it, constable. Finders keepers. Belongs to the gutter. - Haven't finished work? - That's long over. Bu the supervisor hasn't brought the truck, so I'm waiting for him. - Why did you close this? - If I hadn't, we'd both be locked up. A cop came along. I got rid of him with great difficulty. - Alright, I'll make a move. - Wait for a couple of minutes. - I'll just come. - Alright. - Is your master in? - No. - Do you know when he'll return? - No idea. - How's the baby doing? - Baby? That baby your master brought home a few days ago? My master didn't bring any baby here. - What's your name? - Shankar. - Hmm. Listen, Shankar... if there's a baby here, this Rs.1000 can be yours. - There's no child here. - You're lying! Help! Help! Keep quiet! Get up! We'll check his phone. Very good! Am I the only fool to bell the cat? - Why don't you go? - How do I go inside? - Through the door, obviously. - What if someone sees me? - Am I invisible that I'll go unnoticed? - Moti? - Yes? - You're Marina's friend, aren't you? Yes, I am, but it's... Er... use her as a means to get in. She's a means of getting safely into the compound. I'm not going to enter the house. - Then I'll go. - Go ahead. But, listen, what do I tell Bani if something happens to you? - No, let me go. - Give that here. I'll go. - Moti? - So you will go? - What else? And if I don't return, assume I'm dead. - Hello? lnspector Jagdish speaking. - Inspector Jagdish... Moti speaking. I'm going to take Rai Mohan's statement. - What statement? - His confession. - How? - I've a trick up my sleeve. In the meantime, be ready. - We might catch Mrs. Rai Mohan's killer today. - Wish you good luck. Marina... hmm... she's angry. Are you angry with your John, darling? Darling... I'm nobody's darling! Hey, you're crying. What's wrong? As if you care. How would you know what happened here in just three days? What happened? My master's baby disappeared. So what's the big deal? I'll inform the cops right away. No, John, no. The master has forbidden us from telling anyone. - Is that so? - I might even lose my job. John's sweetheart is worried about an ayah's job? Silly. But, tell me, who's in the house now? - No one at all. - No one? Then, come on. - Er, when will your master come? - He always comes late. Really? Then, come on. - Listen, how long are you on duty? - Until 8 o'clock. If Ms. Neena gets a call or goes out, inform me immediately. - Yes, sir. - I'm going straight home. Hmph! Third class! If the piano is removed, this will look like my servant's room. - Servant's room? - Yes, because my house in Goa... - is 10,000 times better than this. - Really? - Of course! - Where is the switchboard? - Whatever for? Switchboard? For this machine. - What's the machine for? - You. For your voice. So I can record it. So we can send the recording to the company for a job. The job is for you. And you... - Really? - Yes. Where is it? Gently... gently... Very good. Thank you! My beloved, I lost myself in your gaze I lost my heart, my dear, I lost my heart I repressed a smile and fell into your trap It became difficult to take my eyes away I lost my heart, my dear, I lost my heart My beloved, I lost myself in your gaze You threw Cupid's dart while walking, in such a way... that I was left wringing my hands It's become very difficult to save myself I've lost my heart, my dear, I've lost my heart My beloved, I've lost myself in your gaze I haven't been able to sleep since that day when my eyes met your gaze It is getting difficult to spend the nights alone I've lost my heart, my dear, I've lost my heart My beloved, I've lost myself in your gaze My master is back! Hide! Hello? Oh... it's you, Neena. You... Go away from here. Just a minute, darling. No, darling. Not yet. But I'm trying my best to find the child. - Why... why do you worry? - I know how hard you're trying. But I warn you, I want my child or I'll call the police! Are you out of your mind, Neena? Our hands are tainted with blood. We'll be hanged. You worry about yourself. Let the police handle the kidnappers. What nonsense are you spouting, Neena? I'm surprised you cannot understand. Look, Neena, listen... you delivered the baby in the maternity home as Mrs. Rai Mohan. You traveled with my wife from Delhi to Bombay. And you left your child in that same compartment. - Understood? - I did all this at your bidding. That's true. But there's no other witness to this other than the two of us. And Mr. Khanna? I sent Mr. Khanna to the same place I sent my wife. Now if you go to the police... then remember we will be in trouble. I'm ready to be hanged for my child's sake. - I'll definitely inform the police. - Wait, Neena! It would be a mistake for you to go to the police. But if you're so insistent... then I'll report it myself. Rest assured. Now I'll rest only after I bring back your child. He's put the phone down. You may leave. John! John's life is in complete disorder, my love. Some other time. Johnny! What a strange man you are! What if I'd suffered a heart attack! - Got the job done? - Our job is done... but someone else is going to be killed. - What happened? - He put the phone down... and got a pistol. I thought Motilal's days were numbered. But it was a blessing that he didn't see me. - Then? - He went out, got into his car and drove off. I'm still sweating. Let's get out of here. Hotel Majestic? Miss Neena, please. Yes, yes, Neena. Miss Neena, Ajay speaking. Rai Mohan is coming to kill you! Save yourself somehow. I'm informing the police. - What sort of a joke is this? - Hurry, inspector. Rai Mohan has gone to Hotel Majestic to kill Neena. - Who is Rai Mohan? - Please step this side. Our hands are tainted with blood. He's the man who got Khanna to kill his wife at Bombay Central... and then, killed him too. - But who are you? - Ajay. Lawyer. Headquarters? Rush to Hotel Majestic. Throw away the pistol or you'll be shot. Beware! If you take one step forward, I'll shoot her! You've not followed me, but your own death. Our hands are tainted with blood. We will both be hanged. Why don't you understand? You delivered the baby in the maternity home as Mrs. Rai Mohan. You traveled with my wife from Delhi to Bombay. Upon reaching here, you left your child in that same compartment. - Understood? - I did all this at your bidding. That's true. But there's no other witness to this other than the two of us. And Mr. Khanna? I sent Mr. Khanna to the same place I sent my wife. If you still wish to report this to the police, go ahead. But remember, we will be in trouble. This evidence proves that the accused, Bani, is innocent. Therefore, this court acquits the accused, Bani. Congratulations, Mr. Ajay. Excuse me. Best of luck. Order. Order! So, this proves that the accused, Bani, is a killer. And so skillful an assassin... that, with one glance, she destroyed Ajay, her lawyer. Therefore, by section 302 of the Indian Penal Code... the accused, Bani, is sentenced to life mprisonment in Ajay's private jail. And the court of love is adjourned for the honeymoon season.
