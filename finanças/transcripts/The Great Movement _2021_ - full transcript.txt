Fighter's heart! - [Siren wails] This comrade played the lead in the film Viejo Calavera. He came on foot from Huanuni. It took seven days. Let me ask you, how are you doing, comrade? We walked all the way from Huanuni. How was it? Our feet hurt. The nights were cold. We walked for seven days. Comrade, that must have been really rough. Really hard. - Were there women? - Yes, they had a hard time. They were carrying heavy loads. It was really hard. We camped out in front of City Hall. The police beat us back, right? They showed up at dawn and said they were moving us to San Francisco Square. But they dropped us in El Alto. Comrade, we're just here to demand work. Yes, secure jobs for all the comrades here. [Bustling street noise] [Gallo] He almost ran you over, Elder. Heads up. - [Gallo] They've got cool stuff here. - [Gato] Yeah, great stuff. [Gallo] Gato, you can get some underwear here. Those trainers are super. Check out those cool sweatsuits! Elder, this would be nice for your mother. What do you think? How much is it? [Clerk] 250. That's a lot. Can you come down? [Clerk] I'll take 240. It's still too much. We'll be back. I'm going to look around. I'm sorry but it's too expensive. Sorry, bro. See you. [Gallo] Elder, what's the matter with you? Come on, let's go. Let's go. Cut the crap. [Gato] Shit, this asshole is dragging his damn feet. [Gallo] Hurry up, Mamani! I'll kick your ass. Fuckin' leave me alone. I'm wiped out.

The environment is killing me. [Gallo] The environment? What the hell are you talking about? The environment... [Elder] I mean the altitude. [Gallo] The altitude, bro? Are you a fucking gaucho? Or a fucking carioca? Where the fuck are you from? Look at the wrecked cars. All smashed up. Cabs. This fucker has fallen asleep again. [Gato] The thing is, in the mine, he swallowed a shitload of dust. [Gallo] Should we let him sleep? [Gato] We'll have to carry him. Wake him up.

You'll be like Superman, with X-rays coming out of your eyes. [Gallo] It's medicine. It works. [Gato] The walk made the fucker sick. - [Gallo] For sure. - [Gato] X-rays! Come on, man! Take a drag. - Kill it. - [Elder splutters] You little prick. [Tires screech] [Gallo] Look, there's a crash. They must be drunk. [Gato] Let's check it out. - [Motorcycle passes] - [Gato] We'll manage, bro. Even if it's just a month's rent, we'll come up with the dough. We'll buy the other stuff as we go. We'll get by, Gallo. - [Gallo] Are you sure? - Yeah. [Gato] Here, Elder, have some. - [Elder] No, man. You two eat it. - [Gato] At least taste it. [Elder] I have a headache, bro.

[Flames crackle] [Commentator, in English] How they will put their bodies on the line here... is beyond description. - And The Undertaker says... - [Commentator 2] He's doing it! [Commentator] "..You want me up there? You wanna come up there and fight? - "I'm gonna come up and whip your butt!" - [Commentator 2] Oh, my God. No, he may not make it up. [Wrestler grunts] [Commentator] The Undertaker in a very precarious position... [Gallo, in Spanish] The Undertaker got killed in one of his fights. When they were burying him, he woke up. He went after Rey Mysterio and took him out. In that fight, he finished him off. [Gallo] Fuck, look at that! So bad! Check it out, Tortus. He's going to smash him. You see, Toga? Look, that guy is tougher. - He's going to eat him up. - He's his prey. There's a cooler fight on the other screen. UFC is broadcasting. [Gato] Have a drink. It'll warm you up. - [Gallo] Go ahead, Elder. - [Gato] You'll get loaded. Right? Yeah, it'll warm you up and knock you out. [Gallo] Look how that ogre grabbed him! Look at that.

Linder. I heard your mother died. I've known you since you were a kid. Now you're a young man. So, now... ..you've come here. What are you doing? Are you working? What are you doing? You came looking for a job but can't find one. You're not working. You're hanging out with bad people. You're drinking. That's no good. We came all this way... to look for a job. My friends and I had nothing. We walked for seven days to find work. - We're with the miners' jobless movement. - Yes. You gotta pay me more, boss. My feet hurt, my back aches. I have other jobs to do. I'm late. Please, you gotta pay me more. - Please. - All right, then. Will you call me back? If you want to work, just come by. [Car horn] Hello, young man. Hello. How are you? Can I help you? Well, young man... I heard that your mother passed away. I've come to give you my condolences. I'm so sorry. - My heartfelt condolences. - Thank you. Your mother was my dear friend. She worked here in the market. I heard she passed away, so, I wanted to give you my condolences. That was a long time ago. She had a lot of problems here. They made her life impossible. Is that why she passed away? How sad. I thought, "Oh, how sad." She was such a dear friend. Don't look at your phone. - I've come to ask you a favour. - What is it? I have a godson. He just arrived from Oruro looking for work. I can't find a job for him. And I was told that you might have work for him... The food got there super late. And half of it was gone. - Right? - Sure. There was hardly any grub. [Elder wheezes] What's wrong with you, Mamani? - Are you a donkey? A fucking mule? - [He mimics wheezing] Shit, what's wrong with you, man? You scared me. I feel dizzy. - What's the matter? - How about a shot? I want to know who that old lady is. She called you godfather or godson. She says she's my godmother but I don't know her. You never mentioned her. Not once. - I don't know her. - But she was calling you. How is she related to you? [Gallo] He's a sly bastard. She says she knew my mum. I don't know her, bro. [Gallo] You're a liar. Maybe she thinks you're someone else. [Gato] It's probably your clone. This prick has been cloned! Come on, admit it! [Gallo] Do you have a clone or not? Come on! 'Fess up! Bro, you must know that lady. [Elder] I have no idea who she is.

The old ones. Look at this. It could be worse. If a sheep comes here... even at night... Rest in peace, papito. [Chirping continues, stream burbles] The wretched creature... knows how to hide here in the thicket. In Chimoré, rattlesnakes until the Gioconda. I know a beautiful viper. Where does it come from? A faraway viper. From Asia. Ah, no. From the Sahara Desert.

But what were you saying? You said there was... - [Max] A cat, a black panther. - A black panther. - [Max] It rarely shows itself. - That's why I came on a Friday morning. I came at two in the morning. You said it would appear. I didn't see it. You're lying, Max. We won't believe anything you say. [Max] I won't beg you. You sleep here. You don't even make it to Abaroa Bridge. Liar. We don't believe you any more. What's the matter with you? Because... [Max] Poof! Like an old woman! You've been told not to smoke but you don't care. You should listen. [Max] Smoking is better than your smokescreen. [She laughs] [Woman] It's all in your head. We don't believe you any more. [Woman 2] You should quit smoking, Max. Cigarettes will take you from this world. Don't you realise? You have to take care of yourself. [Women talk at once, voices overlap] Come on, dance! Change your clothes and get washed up! Max! Go wash up. You're really dirty! At least get your moustache trimmed. [Max] I will, mamita. It's about time. How many citizens live on your head? - [Max] I've only counted three, mamita. - [Woman laughs] There must be over a thousand. All your tenants. [Indistinct chatter] Give me some Coca-Colita. The flowers look nice here. - You know, you're like a mother to me. - I know, Max. - May God always keep you. - Amen. Always. We're going to live to 100. I don't want to live that long! Every daughter-in-law would come after me. [Mama Pancha laughs] Ah, Mama Panchita. Here's to you. - God bless you. - Amen, Max. An offering for the Pachamama. Here's to you, Max. Don't get drunk. [Bang reverberates in distance] That's fine, Max. - Is it going to rain or not? - No, it's not going to rain. People are really annoying. They make trouble for nothing. You're right, mamita. Ladies first, horses second. - We'll wait for the rain to pass. - [Bang reverberates in distance] - Yes, mamita. - You see? Yes, Mama Panchita. - Slowly. - Yes, Mama Panchita. This building has collapsed so many times. - He's really lost. - [Max murmurs] There's no one to look after him. His mother's gone. She died. [Max] Let's see what the cards say, mamita. Shall I read the cards? Yes, tell me what's in store for my godson. [Max mutters] [Siren in distance] [Max mutters] Cut the deck. [Bang reverberates in distance] [Bang reverberates in distance, siren wails] [Dogs bark in distance] Ah, mamita... I wish... - What does it mean? - You know what? Four or five years ago, in the woods. It was three or four in the morning, I was walking alone. I saw a dark shadow behind a plant. The whole place smelled of sulphur. The shadow suddenly turned into a demon. A dark shadow. And that shadow is in the Rodríguez market, mamita. La Paz will crumble to dust!

I don't want to fucking look like this! - [Elder] Go on, then! - For the last fucking time, let's go! [Gallo mutters] [Indistinct chatter] [He inhales sharply] [Birds chirp, coo] [He exhales sharply] Don't you drop those bags again. Don't make me mad. Do it right. If you keep dropping things I won't pay you. I'm warning you. You're weak. Watch what you're doing. Faster! You have to load faster if you want to make money. [Women laugh] Faster! Look, he can't do it. That little bag will be the end of you. Don't try my patience! You dropped some again. [Engine idles nearby] [Man speaks Spanish on TV] [Lively chatter] [Bang reverberates in distance] Boss, there's money missing. That's not what we agreed on. - There are three of us. - It's close enough. Look, bro, that's all I can pay you. It's all I've got. He can't carry anything. It takes him twice as long. - Pay us more! - That's all I can pay you.

[Gato] Yeah, that's me. The police messed with me, saying, "What are you doing here?" "You know what you're into." [Gallo] Give me a drink, bro. - [Man] Cheers. - [Gallo] That reminds me... [Man] The same thing happened to me once. - That's really rough. - [Gallo] Cheers, bro. - [Gato] Thanks, man. - [Man] That's rough there. [Gallo] Look what they're doing. That guy's hurt. He's about to pass out. His shoes are falling off. That's fucked up! They're beating them up. Those cops are a pain in the ass. Quiet down, boys! Let us sleep. We're not here to drink. We want to sleep. Go to sleep then, ma'am. Go to a 5-star hotel if you want a good night's sleep. What's her problem? That lady is fucking annoying.

To date, Santa Cruz has recorded 1,633 cases. What could it be, doctor? If he's fine, then maybe it's the devil. The devil has taken over his body and made him cough like this. I can't afford to take him to the hospital. I'll be frank with you, señora. We no longer believe in those things. In medicine, we don't believe in the devil. There's no such thing. We rely on exams. We examine the patient to determine what's wrong. His problem... is mainly psychological. Stress. Exhaustion. [Gallo] We're almost there, buddy. - [He grunts] - Hang in there. [Dogs bark] [He coughs, wheezes] [Elder wheezes softly, dogs bark in distance] [Mama Pancha] I beg you, Lord, with all my heart, to heal my godson. I'm suffering so much, Almighty Lord. Help me.
