[music playing] Hello. WOMAN: Hi. [motor buzzing] [scream] What are you doing here? You know. I don't understand. Yes, you do understand. Listen, Bruno, Mr. Clavel, I don't know what you're playing at, but I want you out of my house, now. I'm not getting out. I'm gonna kill you! [scream] Don't you like that? You liked it before. [scream] [banging] Stop! I'll shoot. No you won't. [gun clicking] You can't kill me. See? [clicking] Why are you doing this? You know. [gun shot] Just to be sure, I'm going to shoot you in the back of your head. [gun shot] [grunt] [scream] Get up. Get up! Or I'll blow your god damn balls off. I'm not coming near you. I'm leaving. You won't shoot me in the back. You see? I know you. I'll be back. Sergeant Frank Howard, Metropolitan Police. Who's in charge up there? - Oh, great. Thanks, Ed. Sheriff who? Let me speak to him, will you? Yeah, I'm in a hurry. Bull shit, Tony. She and this Bruno Clavel had an argument. Now she's trying to put his nuts in a wringer by crying rape. Yeah? So you think this is her knife, huh? It could be. Look, I know some broads so god damn vindictive they'd mug Mother Teresa if they thought it would help them railroad some poor jerk they had it in for. You know the wrong kind of women, Frank. Yeah. Yeah, I'm still here. Yeah. I need you to do me a favor. There's a guy-- There are a couple of details I'd like to ask you about. He thinks I'm lying. Doesn't he? Frank? Not really. He's just bothered by a few things. Oh, so am I. I shot him point blank. Aside from there being no blood and no forced entry, there is the fact that you know you assailant. I don't know him. I met him once about a month ago. I was doing some research in Lee Valley for this book I'm writing, and Clavel, which was one of the places I stopped at. I interviewed him for about an hour, that's all. And you lost your keys while you were there? Maybe that's how he got in, but that's the only time I've ever seen Mr. Clavel until tonight. Why'd you change your clothes before you called us, Miss Thomas? Because they were torn. I felt dirty. That's understandable. You were probably in shock. Happens to a lot of assault victims. I think we got everything we need for now. Why are you so sure it was Bruno Clavel you had this little party with tonight? Because I recognized him. Look, if the lady says it was Clavel, let's work under that assumption. Well, that might be a mistake, partner. I just checked with Sheriff Laurenski in Lee valley. Bruno Clavel's at home, and he has been all evening. But he can't have. It's impossible. It sure as hell is, lady. Lee Valley's over 90 miles away. So either your pal Bruno's got wings, or you've got a very nasty imagination. Let's go, Tony. Hey, Miss Thomas. Where'd you get the gun? It belonged to my ex-husband. Well, the permit's expired. You want it back, renew it. Maybe you'd be more comfortable staying in a hotel tonight. I'm not gonna get run out of my own home. 24-hour locksmith, get him over to change the locks before you go to sleep. OK? Good night. Good night. Do you believe that broad? Bruno Clavel owns half of Lee Valley. He's a fucking pillar of the community. Bruno's home in bed. She should have done her homework. Somebody tried to kill her. Maybe not Clavel, but somebody. Look at this knife. It was scored by something. Maybe it was the bullet she shot at the guy. And you didn't help matters any by bullying her. It's becoming obvious we work in different ways, pal. That's your type, man. Some rich bitch who thinks we're her personal public servants. She really must have done a number on you. Who? I don't know, wife, girlfriend, whoever made you decide that women are the enemy. Fuck you, partner. All right. So this one here is for the elevator door. This one here's for the downstairs door. OK, thanks. All right. Good night. Good night. [phone dialing] It's me. No, she had a fucking gun. What about the sheriff? Ah, good. She's hard to kill. I knew she would be, but-- yeah, I will. Don't worry. [banging] [glass clattering] [door clicking] [screaming] No, stop. [inaudible] Cut the rope! Please! [yelling] [muffled grunting] [doorbell buzzing] Hello. Who is it? KAYLA (ON INTERCOM): It's your overworked and underpaid agent with the contract for your new book. And could you hurry it, Hilary? I got a cab waiting down here. Hang on, Kayla. I'm coming down. So, how are we this morning? Oh, someone broke in last nigh. Oh, lord, Hilary. You all right? A little shaky. I warned you about this neighborhood. You know, I just heard of a great sublet. It's up near me. I'm going to get you the number. It wasn't someone from this neighborhood. There's the contract. - Yeah. I want you to read them over and call me as soon as you can. Think about that sublet. A lot of single guys in that building, you know, professional types. You never know. Will you stop dealing for once. - Call me. - I will. Thanks. [suspenseful music] [choking] Think you can hide from me, don't you, Katherine? I don't know you're there? I'm gonna kill you, Katherine. I'm gonna do you, and I'm gonna kill you. This time, you'll stay dead. [alarm beeping] [grunting] Katherine! [screaming] [grunting] TONY: He's driving a red Mustang. Anyone see him around? Looks like any other small time punk. What did he do? Hold up a candy store? That's right, sweetheart. And in the process, he blew away a 14-year-old kid. Does that make him more your style? Back off, Frank. Sorry. Have you see a little fucker? His name is Valdez. He's a dust dealer, PCP. We think he's been sampling too much of his own shit. I ain't seen nothing. Come on, Raquel. Thanks, partner. That was real slick. Bitches didn't know nothing. They wouldn't have told you if they did. WOMAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Victor, 804, report in, please. Victor, 804. This is Victor, 804. WOMAN (ON POLICE RADIO): There's been a repeat assault in the case of 6779 Water. Responding. [tires screeching] [police sirens] Now do you believe me? You all right? Yeah, I'm OK. Well, someone's sure as hell got hurt. Question is who? - It was Bruno Clavel. So why don't you drop the sarcasm and get on with your job? - Look, lady-- Call it in, Frank. He was waiting for me. He was crazy. He kept calling me Katherine. I still-- Thanks, man. I still had the kitchen knife in my pocket. And why me? I don't understand. Tony. Headquarters just called. They found a guy stabbed five minutes from here. He was DOA at County General. Yeah? The ID on him said he was Bruno Clavel. So you say he was just brought him? FRANK: Yeah. He should still be in our waiting room then. Two pathologists were canned. You know, budget cuts? You ought to see the backup we got in the slice and dice room. Here, this ought to be your guy. Oops. Sorry, Rock Hard. Pet name we have for him. Rigor, does some strange things. Sure does. If he's donating his organs to science, put me down for a dick transplant. Yeah, we'd have a long line up for that one, Lieutenant. Can we get on with this? Yeah, sure. I remember where he is. Here. You recognize this man? It's him. It's Bruno Clavel. Sheriff of Lee Valley's got a lot of explaining to do. You better believe it. If there's anything I can't stand it's some asshole that makes me look like an asshole. Is that all you've got to say? Look, Miss Thomas, you have every right to be angry. We're sorry. We screwed up. All right. All right. I'm the one who screwed up, not Tony. If there's anything we can do-- You can buy me a drink. [music playing] Thanks. I needed that company. Well, try not to kill anybody else tonight. Tony and I don't have any more time to babysit you. Don't you work so hard at being a jerk, Frank? You really don't think I'm too hard on women, don't you? Woman being, Miss Thomas in particular. It's probably because of the two bimbos I married. I'll try and put a leash on it, but I don't promise anything. Why don't you walk the lady home? I'll wait in the car. You going be OK? I know the hysterical female, in spite of what your partner thinks. I just want to forget this whole nightmare and get back to my real life. [sighs] I um-- I'd like to see you again. Will you have dinner with me? Oh, thanks, but no. You don't date cops? I don't date. I gave it up when I gave up smoking. I fall off the wagon occasionally. [laughter] Tomorrow night? 8 o'clock? I have a gigantic appetite. I know a place that serves truck drivers. BRUNO (ON TV): Nobody's come up with a decent machine for apple picking. WOMAN (ON TV): You're pretty kind at that, Mr. Clavel. BRUNO (ON TV): Call me Bruno. Here, for our beautiful guest. WOMAN (ON TV): Why, thank you. [phone ringing] Hello? Hello? Listen, whoever you are, if you want to talk dirty, just let's hear what you got to say because I haven't got all night. [dial tone] Mr. Tavertin of Forever View Mortuary will pick up the remains tomorrow. Young man, there is no next of kin. As manager of Clavel Orchards and executor of Mr Clavel's estate, I am in charge. Now, I've already spoken to city Commissioner Goodwin, and he assures me that the body can be released immediately. So unless you want to take a place on the unemployment line, you will see that it is done. There won't be a problem. - Yes. Quite, Mr. Rinehart. But there is a slight matter of illegality in what you wish. I mean, the Sheriff will-- Never mind the Sheriff. This entire disgraceful business is a blot on the Clavel family name, and I want the matter taken care of as quickly and as quietly as possible. Absolutely, Mr. Rinehart. Forever View prides itself on its discretion. And if I may say so myself, the personal-- Yes. Yes. Yes. Thank you, Avril. Thank you. I like your idea of a truck stop. This place is really nice. It's my ex-partners. His lottery number came in, so he bought this place. Now he's doing what he wants to do. And you're not? I am right now. I don't want the evening to end. You can come in for a drink. I don't turn into a pumpkin till midnight. You'll find it chilly in here, better for the client, you know. I'll start on Mr. Clavel first thing tomorrow. You'll be pleased. I am an artist-- No, Avril. Very well. I'll get right to it. He's not really suitable for viewing yet. There will be no viewing. The burial is tomorrow as is, no preparation, no cosmetics, no fancy casket. Do you understand me, Avril? But, Mr. Rinehart, if I could only touch him up a bit. Nothing. As you wish. You heard the gentleman. What are you waiting for? [dog barking] Do you-- do you usually end up taking your cases, or suspects, or whatever you call them out to dinner? No. Just the innocent ones. That's good. [phone ringing] Somebody has lousy timing. They should be arrested. Hello? Hello? Who is this? Look, if you don't have anything to say, stop calling me. Look, this is the police. There's a tap on this line. Now, if you don't-- [dial tone] That's the fourth time he's called since last night. He's never said anything before though. A phone jerk-off artist probably. Nine times out of 10, they're harmless. Like I said, lousy timing. I'll-- I'll have the department put in a request for an emergency change of phone number first thing tomorrow. So, what is it with you and Miss Thomas? Lover or fast fuck? Why do I get the feeling you know the difference. [laughter] Must be love. At least you got a friend. It's no big deal. I just thought it would be a switch to go with someone whose IQ is higher than her bra size. A lot of touch in that area. God damn, there it is. Jesus, looks like he's been living in there. I don't know. He's got to be around here. I'll call it in. This is Victor 804, we have a make on the Valdez red Mustang. Aw, shit! [rapid gunfire] Officer down! Officer down! Drop it! [gun shot] Did you get him? Yeah. Han on, buddy. Hang on. Geez, it hurts. Does it look bad? No. You're too damn mean to die. You're a good partner, but you can't lie for shit. Ah, Jesus Christ! What? I just wet my goddamn pants. [sirens howling] Nobody's going to know, Frank. This is most unseemingly, Mr. Rinehart. Perhaps I could say a few words. It is not necessary. Hard to understand. Bruno could be a little hard at times, but who could figure he'd try to kill somebody? Well, whatever he did or did not do, it's all over now. TONY: Thanks, Mike. Thanks, honey. I called the precinct and they told me what happened. You want a drink? I've got a bottle of scotch at home. Do you want to have a drink there? Sure. Here, there, wherever. Doesn't make much difference. What I'm doing, you see, is I'm having a wake for Frank, and Frank won't give a shit where I have it, because Frank is dead. He was a screwy, loud-mouth son of a bitch, but he was my partner, and I should've looked out for him better. He wasn't nearly as much of an asshole as he made himself out to be. It's mostly an act. - I know. Give me the keys. I'll drive. Keys. I didn't know Valdez was hiding there. I fucked up. Of course, son-of-a-bitch Frank is dead. [pleasurable moans] Do you know what I feel like now? A hamburger, French fries, and a chocolate shake? How did you know? Don't move. [elevator whirring] I'm up here. But you're dead. You're not gonna get away this time. You're not gonna have a chance to come back. Ah, shit! I'm gonna cut out your tongue, Katherine, stuff your mouth full of garlic so you can't sweet talk your way back from hell. cut out your eyes so you can't see your way back. Cut off your hands so you can't feel. Hilary! I'm going to pound a stake through your heart. [bell ringing] Hilary! What happened? Huh? Are you all right? What? But it couldn't have been Bruno Clavel. He's dead. He's been buried for Christ's sake. Then he came back from the dead. You really believe that? I don't know what I believe. It was him, that voice, all that weird stuff about garlic and driving a stake through my heart like I was some kind of a vampire. What? Well, we didn't make that public. I never even mentioned it to you. I'm sure of that. So? The back of Bruno Clavel's van was filled with vampire stuff, crosses, wooden stakes, all kinds of crap. Jesus. Maybe I'm not crazy after all. What do you mean he's not dead? Of course he'd dead. You don't check in here if you're not. Could there have been some sort of a mix up? I want to see that autopsy report. Clavel, Bruno. We're a little behind on the filing. It's probably right here in front of me. He was about 40, tall, graying hair. You can describe him down to the freckles on his ass, and I still wouldn't remember him after we zipped him and chipped him. I've read of cases where someone's in such a deep coma that people think they're dead, and then they come to and walk away. No, not after we get through with them. You see, we cut them from about here to about here, take all the guts out. Find that goddamned autopsy report. Now! Look, that file has got to be here somewhere. Why don't you just leave me your card. I'll get back to you. - He's alive. I can feel it. And he'll be back. He won't let me go. Look, I've got some time off. Why don't we go up to Lee Valley. Let's find out everything we can about this Bruno Clavel. I know one thing, whoever the hell this joker is, he's not going to hurt you. I won't let him. Oh, yes. Oh. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Here comes the hearse! [knocking] GARY: Oh, Mr. Tannerton. Sorry, my pet. What is it, Gary? I'm working. GARY: There's a policeman here from the city, a Sergeant Clemenza. In a moment. I guess I don't have to ask you to wait, do I, my pet? I can't hang around here all day, Avril. Melanie gets home from daycare at 5 o'clock, and this damn make up takes forever to get off. How can I be of assistance, Sergeant? I understand you handled Bruno Clavel's burial. Yes. A tragedy, really, such a prominent family, the last of the Clavel's, you know? Then you saw the body? Of course. Poor man. Was he embalmed when you took delivery? Well, no. Then you did the embalming? Actually, I should check my records about that. Quit jerking around, Mr. Tannerton. Oh dear, I knew this would happen. I told Mr. Rinehart it was an illegal act, but he was adamant. Mr. Clavel was not involved. You can't be sure he was dead, can you? Can you? Don't be absurd, my dear lady, of course he was departed. I preside at the funeral. TONY: So you didn't actually see Clavel the night that Miss Thomas was attacked? I called the Clavel house and Bruno answered the phone. Or it sure sounded like him. There's no mistaking that voice. I know you've been through a lot, Miss Thomas, And I apologize for my screw up, but we buried Bruno four days ago. What you're suggesting is downright crazy. I know it sounds crazy, Sheriff Laurenski, but he's not buried out at the cemetery. He's alive and still trying to kill me. What do you want me to do, Sergeant? Clavel Orchard is a big part of our community. I'll help in any way I can, but I don't want to start asking people if they've seen Bruno since he was resurrected. [car horn honking] Sergeant Clemenza I presume? Yes. The sheriff alerted me to your theory, Sergeant. He tells me I must cooperate, so I will. And I want you to know that I consider this entire business to be in the worst possible taste. The Clavel family settled this valley. They may be gone, but their name still means something. You seem more concerned about the family name than about what happened to me. Well, I remember your visit quite well, Miss Thomas. It was under the guise of literary research, I believe. I can't excuse what Bruno did, but you were hardly the innocent, with your coy questions, misplaced keys. Bull shit! You're saying I lead him on. That's not true. Well, it's also not the issue. You pulled a few strings, broke a few laws getting Mr. Clavel's body back here. You want to tell us why? I was following Bruno's last wishes, and Katherine's. Who's Katherine? Bruno's mother. We want to talk to her. Well, you'll find her next to Bruno. She died over five years ago. Did Bruno having another office besides this one? Somewhere where he'd keep his personal papers? No. Now, what exactly are you looking for? Interesting design. I have cooperated beyond what is necessary. This is an invasion of privacy, and I insist that you leave. Well, that certainly doesn't belong to us. We don't bank at Hill Haven. We only heard of Mr. Clavel's passing when you called. There was no notice, nothing in the paper. We had no reason to freeze the account. Then how do you explain a withdrawal of $15,000 in cash two days after the funeral? Are you suggesting there was an imposter? I dealt with Mr. Clavel for five years, ever since he's banked with us. I waited on him personally. It was him. Is this the man who made the withdrawal? Yes, Bruno Clavel. TONY: Can we see all of his records? Certainly. He's come back. this proves it. And what this proves is that he's still alive. HILARY: He's had this account for over four years and only ever written checks to three people. I don't get it. He must have been making payments he didn't want Rinehart to know about. Doctor, bookseller, and this Mrs. Yancey, $500 a month regular as a raincheck. I don't know. I think that Rinehart's involved somehow. Maybe he was controlling Bruno and Bruno slipped his leash. Do you think they're going to catch him? There are two cops watching your place. They'll get him. I'm glad we're staying here, where no one knows who I am, or where I am. Tired? How tired? Not that tired. [yelling] [inaudible], Katherine! I don't know any Katherine. Katherine Hilary Thomas. Now, where is she? I don't know. Don't lie to me. She's-- she's in Lee Valley. She left me a message. She's in Lee Valley. Of course. Of course. Bitch is going home. You got the same eyes. The same look. Thought you could trick me, didn't you? Well, I can see you. I can see you in there, mother. The whole family was weird. I remember Leo Clavel, Bruno's granddad. He was a mean bastard. That was his daughter, Katherine. A real pretty woman, but totally under the old man's thumb. They stayed together in that house up on the hill. Katherine adopted Bruno right after the old man died. He was adopted. Mr. Rinehart never mentioned that. He wouldn't. He was real tight lipped when it concerns the Clavel family. Anyway, Bruno was a baby when she got him. Everybody around here considers him to be a Clavel. Son of a bitch. I told myself to watch out for her tricks, but I forgot. She almost fooled me. That was when Katherine left you. She's going home. BRUNO (ON TAPE): She believed in demons, let them make a deal for your soul. They mark you. He was convinced that his sex organs were marked, that his mother had sold his soul to the devil. And Bruno didn't believe that his mother had really died. He was certain that she kept coming back to life in new bodies. Listen to this. BRUNO (ON TAPE): I wake up screaming but I can't really remember it. When I wake up it's always the same. MAN (ON TAPE): Is there anything more you can tell me about your dream? BRUNO (ON TAPE): There's a sound, whispering all around me, whispering, but I can't hear what they're saying. I felt that the recurring nightmare had to be tied in with all of this, so I persuaded him to try hypnosis to help him recall it. She's tracking me, but I didn't-- I'm just a little boy, and she's making me-- no. Don't-- the door. No, don't open it. Don't! Take it easy, now. Where does the door go? To hell. Please, oh, god, she's opening the door. Drop the rope! That [inaudible] Please, mother! No, no, please, mother. I'm sorry, I-- I forgot. [screaming] No, please. I promise I will act like one. One what, Bruno? Jesus-- I can hear-- I can hear the whispering. Come closer. [screaming] No, stop. Help me. Mother! I promise I'll remember. [choking] He was so terrified, his throat seized up. What you hear is Bruno trying to scream. What was in the room? I never found out. He suddenly stopped coming about a year ago. That was his last session. I'm home, Katherine. You can't hide from me anymore. Mr. Clavel was a valued and discriminating collector, particularly interested in literature concerning the living dead. You mean zombies, vampires, that kind of thing? Yes. I'm not speaking of the pulp fiction that's currently flooding the market, however. What then? Well, take this book, for example. He's been waiting for it for weeks. It's the journal of and 18th century Abbas who bore a child and then killed it. She believed that the child refused to die, and took over the bodies of others in order to seek revenge. The Abbas killed some 24 nuns in attempt to lay her child to final rest. Bruno Clavel thinks his mother keeps coming back in other bodies. Yes, so he told me. I suggested the Abbas's journal might give him a clue as to how to deal with her. Don't you realize you're feeding his insanity by selling him this crap? Call it what you will, but it's quite possible Mr. Clavel is possessed, just as the bass was. You can't be serious. Oh, yes. I'm a Satanist. I believe in the dark Lord. His time is coming very soon. Christ worshippers will be slaughtered, babies will be sacrificed on the altars of churches and temples to the dark prince, and fire will consume the good and the weak. I look forward to it. Why don't you read this, perhaps you'll join us. Many do each day. Oh my god, it's true. You're alive. That's not possible. That booksellers suckered Clavel out of almost $25,000 grand in a year. Maybe he wasn't suckered. Maybe he found something in one of those books. Look, I know some insane people are clever, but not clever enough to return from the dead. Are you sure? You really that positive he never died? Please, Bruno. Please, you're-- you're going to need my help. You had your chance to help a long time ago. Now, listen to me, Bruno. I loved your mother. There was a time long before you came when I-- I hoped we marry. She wouldn't have me, but I-- I stayed with the estate. I dedicated myself to it, and I always prayed she might-- she might change-- change her mind. Why did you let her do it to me all those years? Because I didn't know, Bruno. Whatever it is you're talking about, I didn't know. (ANGRILY) Liar! I think someone's expecting us. [doorbell ringing] Mrs. Yancey? I'm Detective Sergeant Clemenza. I'd like to talk to you about Bruno Clavel. Uh-huh. I've been expecting you. During the '40s I had one of the houses here in the city, a whore house, my dear. Yes, I had a stable of 12 girls, and Leo Clavel was a steady customer, so when his daughter, Katherine got pregnant he sent her to me to have the baby. Katherine and later, Bruno, paid me $500 a month for-- for my discretion. And there's nothing you can charge me with, unless Bruno or Katherine file a complaint, which they can't really do, can they? Wait a minute. Bruno was Katherine's real son? He wasn't adopted? That's right, dearie. And Leo Clavel was Bruno's father. Father, daughter, son, nice family, huh? Have a cookie. No, thank you. Katherine was near nervous breakdown when she came to me. Oh, she'd corseted herself, you know, so no one could see her condition. I think Leo kept her pretty busy in bed, right up to her time. And what my girls told me, he had some strange preferences, too. Why didn't you or her father arrange for an abortion? This was the '40s, dearie. Abortions were done on a kitchen table with a coat hanger. Besides, I think old Leo, he was hoping for a baby girl, you know. One he could train. You know what I mean. How could you go along with it? Why didn't you say something? Oh, I'd rather leave the moralizing up to others. I don't like to judge, you know. Downright un-Christian if you ask me. You're a credit to your profession, Mrs. Yancey. Why, thank you. It's too bad I'm not still in the business, dearie. I could have made you into a top money girl. You got that snooty attitude men love to take down a notch or two. So, after the birth, Katherine took the boy home saying he was adopted? Well, it was a difficult labor, and afterwards she became quite batty for awhile. Oh, she'd had this idea she'd been raped by a demon. Well, I had some devils in my time. None of them had a forked tail. Anyways, that Katherine girl proved too smart for her own good. See, she'd already put out the story that she was going to adopt a baby, supposedly the child of a college friend who'd been killed in an accident. Unfortunately, it didn't go that smoothly. BRUNO: She'll be here soon. She'll come up to your room. The slut will think she's safe here. What a surprise she's gonna have. I should have thought of it a long time ago. This is the place she needs to die. Myself and I, we'll have to kill her, and she'll stay dead then. It's time to wake up, now. Did you have a good sleep? There, I want myself to see mother when I kill her. Identical twins by incest, incredible. They didn't stand a chance of being normal. What a dilemma. She told everyone she was adopting one child. How could she explain two? As far as anyone and Lee Valley knows, there was only one Bruno Clavel. My god, she must have kept one or the other of them hidden all the time. Made them pass as one child. But I've seen them both. They were one person, one personality. How the hell did she do that? Remember Bruno's nightmares? The room she put him in for not acting like one. We better report into the sheriff. But first I want to talk to Rinehart. That old man's got to of been part of this whole cover up. The foreman says he saw Rinehart going up to the Clavel house this morning. [car motor starting] Why don't you stay here? I won't be long. I'm coming. Mother's home. [knocking] I'll be back. Mr. Rinehart? If Bruno wasn't crazy already, this house would do it for him. It looks like you're right about Rinehart. Katherine and her father. I've seen enough. This place is evil. Let's go. Why don't you wait outside? I'll see if I can find Rinehart. He, come on. He's an old man. Be careful. Rinehart? Rinehart? Christ all mighty. [creaking] [yelling] [grunting] [fearful cry] Hello, mother. Welcome home. Tony! Tony! We've been waiting for you, myself and I. Are you going into the room, mother? That's right, mother, fall down, bitch! You must obey mother, Bruno. You know what happens if you don't. Get back down there! Let's see how you like it. You like it down in the room, mother. How do you like it, mother? [grunts] Now it's your turn to listen to the whispers, mother. They'll teach you to be good. [struggling cries] That's what you told myself and I, isn't it? I want you to die, mother. I want you to die for good. The whispering will stop. To hell with you. Help, please, mother. Let me out. [screaming] Don't make me stay here. I promise you, I'll be good. Mother. Tony! [gun shot] [music playing]
