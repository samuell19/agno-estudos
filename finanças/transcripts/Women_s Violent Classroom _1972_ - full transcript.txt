Good. Everyone, today's class is over. The mid-term test will be this time next week. Well, I don't really think it will be a big help for your careers. Those who make an effort should be alright.

No need! My mother told me to keep my hair shaved. Anything else'd be too expensive. Boss, are we gonna have fun today? Not a chance. Society fucking sucks. Directed by Norifumi Suzuki Just snatch them. Wait! Do you think you are going to be okay after crossing me like that? What's the problem? Do you want to do anything? Hey! Wait! - Let me go! - This way! Don't make us wait! You have some guts crossing our clan! Give it to me! She told you to give it to her! Can't you hear? Don't ever think this is the end of it. - Hey, get them! - Okay! It stinks! I am Principal Tone Hiraizumi. I've heard about you from the Education Committee. But I didn't know you would be appointed this soon. I just couldn't wait for the day I'd stand in front of students again. Why did you quit the previous school? Well, I hit them. Corporeal punishment... You are not allowed to punish students at this school. The motto of our school is Be a Wise Wife, Be a Kind Mother. I'm against the school being controlled by what the students want. Yoshioka, this is a girls' high school. We don't need to be so strict about it. Anyways, your class is Class 4 of Year 3. No objection? None! Ah, right. Class 4 of Year 3 is the notorious one. Anyway, I've finally come here to meet you. Keiichi, don't overdo it. Do you still worry about every little thing? If you have to transfer to another region for another violation, we won't be able to get married. I do things my way. Anyway, please be nice to the new teacher here. Want to come to my house tonight? I'll tell you about their problems. Okay. Let's do it as a couple for the first time in a while. Class 4, Year 3 Don't Open!! I'm going to be the teacher for your class. I am Keiichi Yoshioka. What was that just now? I'll be lenient just because I am at a private girls' high school. I am here as a teacher. I won't be negligent in enforcing my 3 rules for education. Friendship Companionship Enough is enough! This is a class! Harmony Who was that? Do you think you can threaten me? Listen! I believe in my rules for education. If you have any objections, say it to my face. What? Nobody? You guys are cowards. You think you are more than high school kids. But now that I'm here, stupid things like this won't fly anymore. You seem ridiculously confident. But you'd better not get involved. For your own safety. What? At this school we make the rules. One day, we will make you follow our rules. Yoshioka, you don't have to be depressed about this. This school is like a trash bin. All we can do is to sit on the lid and keep the trash from spilling out. How can you say that as a teacher? Seiko Girls High was established to handle the trash transferred from normal schools. That's ridiculous! A teacher's role is different from other occupations. You shouldn't say things like that. That's right. I agree with Yoshioka. You guys are still young. Once trash, always trash. The school doesn't provide any resources or funds for educating this trash. Obviously, there is not much we can do. Night Shift Office It is possible to make Japan prosper and livable... Excuse me. What are you doing here this late? I was told that I could not graduate if I got a zero on the test. So, I tried very hard at home. But there is something I just can't figure out. Could you teach me? Right, right... - Do you finally feel like studying? - Yes. Cute, cute... I'll teach you. I'm so happy. You're such a good teacher. I am touched. - Give it to me. - Yes, I am on it. Right, right... - What is this? - I am giving it to you. That's not what I asked for! Give me the textbook! I was going to study overnight, so I brought clothes for it. - Please... - Hey, stop it! I am reading The Theory for Revamping Japan at the moment. Stop saying such hard to understand things. The only hard thing should be in your pants. Sir, would you give me 100? I will. 100 or 200, it doesn't matter. I am glad. Alright, I'd better revamp this before Japan. Akiko! That won't do! I told you, 50 grand. I had a hard time to raise even this much. Please forgive me! Don't try to trick me, bitch! Please forgive me! Wait! You guys can't rob one of us! Who do you think you are talking to? You can't do this even if you're the daughter the school board's president. - Isn't your mother just his mistress? - What? We are the only clan at Seiko Girls High. If you don't comply with us, we'll fuck you up. Fine! Follow them! - You bitch! - Don't touch me! This is not an exit! I'll give you a special treatment! Get in there! Everyone in there! That's the last one! The last one! Close it! Open up! Open up! It's going to get hot! Don't move! Stop! Michiko! I won't forget this! Open up! It's hot! Michiko! Come here and have some tea. Michiko! Can't you hear? Did you drink again? Michiko, where are you hanging around these days? I hang out wherever I want! Be quiet! I can't study for my test! What if I don't get high school admission? Michiko! At least pretend to be a proper high schooler. - Everybody is worried about you. - Leave me alone! What kind of tone is that? What if something happens again? I am a government official! I have a lot of responsibilities! How can you talk about my rape now? Do you think this is the right time?! Michiko! Why have you become like this? Nobody understands my feelings! Why are you trying to cover up the fact that I was raped? Just one broken layer of skin, that's it! Then, why do you look at me like that? Just like looking at something dirty! I was raped here by strangers 2 years ago. That day changed my entire world completely. Let me go! Be quiet! Let me go! Stop it! This is where I was raped. I come here in order to readjust myself. This is the place I avoided initially. The rapists win in our society. My lifestyle has changed from being raped to raping. There is no rage. I've become stronger. The rape was a turning point for me. The problems with Yuki Onozaki? Yes. It seems she hurt someone at her previous school. I want you to lead the class with your exceptional skill. - Good morning, sir! - Good morning! Good morning, sir! Sorry about that. - Where is the principal? - She will be here soon. - Isn't she already late? - What's the problem today? - It's about the building renovation. - I see... I have to determine the amount of the donation. Hey, greet him! He's a VIP. I'm Yoshioka. So you're Yoshioka. I am Takeo Kohri. Daisaku Kohri's first son. - Nice to meet you. - I've heard a lot about you from Kyoto. I feel confident about your service as a teacher with strong values. - I want to do everything I can. - That's what I'm talking about. Yuki Onozaki is the leader of Hanazono High School, right? That's right. I heard she was transferred for beating someone. Such a rough one got into our school. Whoever this Yuki is, this school isn't Hanazono. We won't let her become someone important in Seiko Girls High. Wait, is she really coming? She should be starting today, but nobody has seen her yet. What is that? The massacre song? Are you Yuki Onozaki? Don't play coy. Can't you hear? Anyone who got into Class 4 of Year 3 should greet us! I am Yuki Onozaki, just transferred to Class 4 of Year 3. Nice to meet you. Don't talk as if you were our friend. This is not Hanazono. You have to greet us on your knees! Quite strict, isn't it? What are you doing? Will you won't you? Which is it? Bitch! Listen! On your knees! Like this! Stand up! Don't play coy! What is this? Do it already! Bitch! Shut up! That's enough! I heard you were a tattooed chick with some guts. Turns out you're a coward! Let's go! - Thank you. - Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. The students at this school are pretty lively. This is the first time I've had a guest come to my house. Also, today is my birthday. I see. I turn 17 today. - When is your birthday? - June 25. I've been all alone. - Do you live alone too? - No, I have a grandma. She is in the hospital at the moment. But she will be out soon after a smooth recovery. Your situation is the same as mine. - I lived with my father. - I see. My father died in a car accident. My mother died 4 years ago. Actually, I was even thinking about quitting high school. Why does someone like you attend this school? There is a special system for me. The tuition is free, and I can get a 5,000 yen scholarship per month. You can study at any school if you have a strong enough will. - Happy Birthday! - Thank you! - It seems we can become good friends. - I'd like that! I haven't had many friends here. Me neither. They invited me to their clan and I've was assaulted several times. But I don't do anything I don't agree with. You appear to be a kind person. But you must be very determined. People are all alone in the end. That's why you need someone you can trust. Doesn't matter how long I have to be alone. I just need someone I can really trust. Welcome. Mr. Takeo, as you ordered... I won't give up until I get that woman... Isn't she one of your students? Also, she is a virgin. Why don't you give up? You may risk your life. A dangerous duel is part of dealing with women. Tell my father that. Yoko! - A call for you. - Yes! - How is business? - Good, thanks to your regular visits. - Mama? - Yoko. - I will leave it to you. - Yes! Welcome. You're very cute today. Thank you. I almost feel guilty for putting you in this kind of place. It is your birthday today. A present. Open it. It will look good on you. Wow, impressive! I'm drunk. - Are you feeling bad? - No. - No! No! Stop it! - I want you! Stop! No! No! No! Stop! - Matsumoto! - Yes! - Mizaki! - Yes! - Midorikawa! - Yes... - Muto! - Yes. - Morita! - Yes! - Moriyama! - Yes! - Yamaguchi! - Yes! - Yamada! - Yes! - Yamano! - Yes! - Watanabe! - Yes! Alright! As I promised last week, today I will tell you about the revolution in Chinese society. More, more, more... more...! Wait! Let's show the real Class 4 of Year 3! - Show him! Look! - Stop it! Stop! I told you to stop doing stupid shit! Look closely! Stop it! Look at me! Liberating your desires is good for your health! Stop it! Get off! Get off the desk! Hey, everyone! He said to get on the desks! He hasn't seen me yet! You're a teacher. Show us an example! You idiot! Shit! Sir, you'd better not do something stupid. Onozaki! It doesn't matter how much you preach at them. It won't ever be through. The more you push them, the stronger their resistance will become. The best way is to let them be. Things will calm down then. Who do you think you are? Don't talk as if you're better than us! Stop! Don't act like a child! If you want to make a fuss, do it later. I heard you calmed down the riot in your class. Everybody is saying that you are a cool girl. I've already graduated from that kind of reputation. I am just ordinary Yuki Onozaki now. People won't let you be like that. As a sign of our friendship, I will invite you to my home. Thank you. I wanted to become friends with you too. Daughter of the president of the school board... What a life... A big house and a big pool... This life is totally different from mine. You can use it anytime. It's open to my friends. Thank you. Anyway, would like to take the offer? Can I be really that useful? What are you talking about? If you are on my side, I can do anything. I can't let Michiko go around like this anymore. I want to annihilate her. So, it's done, right? Okay, if you insist. Okay. Done. We are best friends starting today. Takeo! I told you to expedite the university business! Everything is fine. We only need the committee chief. I don't care what methods you use. If you need a girl, get one. I understand. But, father, as a president, it doesn't look good if you get involved directly. President, I agree. Shut up! I can't let this go any further! Mr. Takeo! Did you come here to lecture your father again? - Well... You can put it that way. - But it doesn't seem to be working. Let me go. There is no other woman like me. Right, honey? You are Sumiko's mother, anyway. - Who is playing? - Who is it? Who is she? That's Yuki Onozaki. She just transferred. Has Sumiko earned that much? Of course, she has unlimited resources behind her. Most of the staff are already absent on sick leave after hearing about it. There is a rumor that she's trying to build an alliance with some other clans. Why do you tell me that now? Where is their activity taking place? In the lobby of the Palace Hotel. It seems that Sumiko will bring other clans with her as well. Hatsue, Mayumi. We need to act now. We can't let them control our territory like that. Alright? - Okay. - Good luck! Michiko, I need the reward for my information. Come to the toilet. Come. Can't you do it quieter? - Can I do it one more time for 10 grand? - Get off me! 10 or 20 grand makes no difference. I will let you do it for better information. Listen, Hiroko! Pins should collapse up to the 3rd one. You should not mess with the box. No worries. It's my specialty. Let's do it. - Keiko, wait! You forgot the gloves again. - Yeah... - Get it together! - Good luck! I'm impressed that I can have sex with a schoolgirl at my age. These are the best kind of boobs! Hey, that's rude! Sorry, my test is tomorrow. Please do all the work this time. By myself? Who are you?! Mister, there is an embarrassing photo of you. Would you give us 200 grand? What? A 100 grand ransom? Shit! Such a dirty trick! Fine. You don't care about their safety, right? We are branding them as we speak. If you want to settle the matter, come to the theater at 4. If you don't keep the promise, they will be completely burned. Be quiet! They finally fell into our trap. We'll make them pay back twice as much. Did you bring the underlings? Did you bring the promised money? I'd rather flush the money down the toilet! That means you don't care about their safety... Are you going to stab them or what?! Enough is enough! What? You bitch! I'll kill you! There they are. Hold this for a while. You'd better not get involved. You can't do it by yourself. I'll be fine! Stop it! What are you doing? Stop it! Hey! Stop it! What is this? I'd rather have some zoo animal bite me than deal with you! Stop this bullshit! No matter how hard you try, society is already a mess. You blame society for everything. Take responsibility for what you do for once! Shut up! I already told you that it's a mess! How dare you hit me as a teacher? You bastard! That hurt. Keiichi! Stop it! There is no other way to fix them. That hurt, teacher. I like what you got. - Let's discuss it somewhere else. - Discuss? We have to talk this through. There is a good place around here. That's right. I knew there would be some common ground. Anyway, let's start over tomorrow, remembering the feelings here today. - Yes. - Everyone. Okay? Yes. We have been waiting for a chance to talk with you like this. Let's have a toast to celebrate today. - Alright! - Yes! Here. Well then, Cheers! Keiichi! Are you okay? Keiichi! How cruel! Keiichi! What? One of our students was involved in prostitution? There is no way one of our students would do such things. It's already been going on for 6 months at the yakuza's places. We can't let this behavior continue, even if a great person like your president runs your school. Principal! We should not treat Sumiko Fukumoto differently just because she is the daughter of the president. You idiot! Stop talking nonsense! Calm down! We have to take some time to investigate this. - I don't think we need that. - Why? Prostitution is a sin. This school has not only prostitution but also violence-related problems. Taking advantage of this opportunity, we have to punish the problematic students. What? Welcome! I've handled things with the police. Nothing will go public, then. They were persuaded by what I said. That's a good thing. Are you going to cover this up? Obviously. If this goes public, the school's reputation will suffer. Reputation? Why do we have to do such things? You! If we don't do this, the number of applicants will decrease starting next year! That kind of attitude is the problem. That's why the students go astray. Wha... How naive... Private schools are companies with shareholders. Good ones and bad ones are all part of the school. Your mission as a teacher is to make the bad ones good. That's right. Listen! If you think you'll get away with this because you weren't directly involved, you're wrong. You guys will be 18 soon. If you have something to say, tell me squarely. If you keep doing dark stuff in dark alleys, you'll end up becoming the trash of society. Hey! What's with your attitude? Mister, my name is Meiko. Call me Meiko! - What? - Let it be. Everything is possible in this zoo. That's right. Not even prostitution will get the president's daughter kicked out of this school. Whatever cool things you say, when the board says you go, you go. What? If students are trash, teachers are trash as well. We're a good match for each other. You bitches! You call yourself high schoolers? Idiots! - Yoshioka! - Leave me alone! At least reflect on your attitude for once! Stop preaching! We will settle this matter soon in broad daylight! - Hey, mister! Hey! - Keiichi! Reiko! You bastards! According to your wish, we will settle this matter in broad daylight! It wasn't hard to figure out she's your lover! Let me go! You animals! You are animals! That's right. In this zoo, no matter what we do, we'll never get kicked out. Okay! Let's rape her! Stop! - Let me go! - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! You bastards! Let me go! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing?! Keiichi! It stinks!! I'll go first. Stop it! Be a Wise Wife, Be a Kind Mother Stop! I was born in Onomichi, in western Japan, which is famous for the novel by Fumiko Hayashi. I was raised in Nonbeyoko-cho in Akita. I control the Kasoba area at the moment. Known as Crazy Onoyuki, I'm here to do battle with you. Thank you for your introduction. I was born and raised around Seiko schools all my life. Known as Omichi of the Ransenkai Clan, I am going to accept your challenge. If I win... Do whatever you want. If I win... I will pass the title of Leader of the Ransenkai clan to you. Understood. The place for battle is always on the Venus Bridge. Come. Shit! That's cowardice. The first one to bleed loses. Okay? Today is a tie. Let's throw knives together. I will definitely conclude this matter later. Cruel!! 4 family members kill themselves! Death caused by debt. The only survivor is the eldest daughter, Yuki. Mr. Morita, I would like your full cooperation with the university business. I understand. But it has been quite controversial recently. I'm not sure I can guarantee something with my authority at the moment. I will try my best. Thank you very much. I would be relieved if you could do something as a member of the Education Board. Mr. Takeo. Me and Mr. Morita? Yes. Just a dinner will do. - Mr. Morita likes you so much. - But... You know how much Mr. Takeo invested in the university business, right? You're going to get married to Mr. Takeo anyway. You will make a good wife. I didn't get much attention until I got married. So now I want to try my best to make you a proper wife. We can help each other. - Okay, I'll leave it to you then. - Yes. As a hostess, you should know better! What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! Apparently, the girl and money worked. Good! That takes care of that! It's not over though. He asked for some money to persuade his colleagues. No problem. If he can persuade them, I don't care how much it'll cost. We can get it back through donations in the end. Everyone in this room is evil. I've helped Mr. Takeo's business too. - I feel a bit guilty. - Girls are always effective. Power is never evil. Use any method to achieve a goal. This is the secret of the Kohri family, Ms. Gineya. Beautiful as always. Mr. President, you flatter me. You don't look 17 years old. Hadn't you been one of our students, I would've fallen in love with you. Would you like to take an extra-curricular class with me? How many times and to how many women have you said that? Such broad shoulders! You look like an elephant. An elephant! Look at me! That's extreme! You know, big isn't always better! And what is this here? My belly button. I see. It's hairy. Mine isn't hairy at all. It's quite big, bigger than mine. Go! Go! And next, Meiko Oh! What a name! Excuse me... Oh, Mister, that's my weakness. Meiko Oh, you are very sensitive! You are pregnant. Here are 30 grand. If you need more, I can think about it. Money? Our relationship was all about money? - Of course not. But... - No! I hate it! Didn't you say Let's get married after graduation? I have your baby in my womb. Can you say without a doubt that this is my baby? There are some rumors going around about you. Anyway, think about it. If you don't have an abortion, I won't take care of anything afterwards. Mr. Takeo! Yoko! You've already graduated as a proper woman. You've become an adult. You should try to get over this. Okay? Please understand. Mr. Takeo! Misaki, I won't say anything bad. Get an abortion. If you don't, the school will kick you out. - Principal, I don't want to! - Get an abortion! If you get an abortion, we will forgive your wrongdoings. - What's wrong? - Please take me to the toilet! This is terrible! Hurry! We will do a physical exam on you! - What is this? - You know exactly what this is! We will kill the baby for the sake of the school. Stop it! Stop it! Yoko! Yoko! What happened? The baby... The baby died... How? Tell me, Yoko! Who killed your baby? Tell me! Who was it? Don't ask me! Here goes! Farewell! Yoko! There is nothing much for me to say about the death of our good student, Yoko Misaki. Misaki's death happened outside the school. Therefore, you have to keep any talk about it to yourselves. Why is that? You guys, who remained after class, were the only ones to witness the incident. In other words, there is no one else who knows the truth. If she committed suicide inside the school, Seiko School's reputation would be damaged. Also, if the fact that she was pregnant comes out... What are you talking about? Tragic events bring bad reputation. That's natural. You're always talking about reputation. The truth is that this school is shit! Watch your mouth! Bad reputation for the school means that you attended a bad school. Think about it, for your jobs, even for your marriages... Do you think anyone in this zoo will ever get a proper job? - Will anyone ever get admitted to a university? - Be quiet! The motto of our school is Be a Wise Wife, Be a Kind Mother. Miss! That's not for you to say this! You're already going through menopause! Old hag! Be quiet. It's not that I don't understand your feelings. No way... I can say one thing openly. It's unfortunate for Misaki. But what's more important are the thousands of students who are attending our school. Stop trying to talk us out of this! The reason Yoko committed suicide is you guys! Sumiko's prostitution job was okay but Yoko's pregnancy was bad? Listen! And don't you forget! We'll rip your masks off in the end! You have to confirm I've delivered it to you. Alright. We are challenging you at the Kitabuse River embankment at 3 PM. No knives involved. I got it. Tell Sumiko that I accepted the challenge. I'll end your lives today. I'll throw those exact words back at you. What? Let's go! Come! This way! This way! You bitch! Wait! Don't run! Wait! Wait! - Don't run! - Let me go! That's a foul. We promised there would be no knives! Do you think promises count in a fight? I'll stab you! Put the knives down! If you don't do it right now, I will shoot everyone! Yuki! You betrayed me! Shut up! A person who makes an alliance with any low-lives just to win is the real coward! Say it! Takeo got Yoko pregnant, right? We already have information about it. You killed Yoko's baby, right? Who asked you to do that? - I don't know! - Don't play innocent! I was ordered. That's all! Did Takeo plan everything? Bitch! Take off all your clothes and apologize on your knees! Yoko is in heaven now. Take it off now! You take everything off too! Apologize to Yoko. Yuki! This is what you left behind. I've read the newspaper article. You've come to this school to avenge your family, right? Let's do it properly! Michiko! Is the battle over? Yes, it went great. Sumiko must be having a toast for the victory. Let's have a toast for both of us. Beautiful! When I first saw you, I thought: How come such a beautiful person exists in this world? I am here with you. I need your love. What's the matter? You seem surprised by the tattoo. I had this flower tattooed when I decided to avenge my family. - Revenge? - Indeed. Just like the tattoo, sins committed by human beings won't ever disappear. Do you remember the house on the hill with a garden at Sannomiya? My real name is Yuki Kikumura. The reason I came to this school and why I'm here tonight, is that I want to send you to hell! What's with that face? I want to see the last moment of the fat pig right before it's getting slaughtered! Bitch! Don't move! What a pathetic person you are! You shouldn't be running a school! Even secretly seducing girls! It's getting big... Does it hurt? - Does it hurt? - It hurts! Not there! Something came out... What are you doing? - What? - Be quiet! I'll show you something fun! Go to the bed and feel up your father's woman! - Get out! - Shut up! I will make you feel the pain my father felt. Take that off! Start! It should be easy enough for a pervert like you! - Look! - I'm looking! Seiko School is already finished. The evidence of the bribery scandal and the cause of Yoko's suicide won't disappear. Go to hell using your own hands! - Get that end. - Okay. Don't be angry. Feel grateful that we didn't kill you. Apologize to the students for being too incompetent to run a school! Everything is resolved! By telling the company, everything will be over. Leader, it's going to be fun from now on, right? Idiot! It won't be fun. Society fucking sucks.
