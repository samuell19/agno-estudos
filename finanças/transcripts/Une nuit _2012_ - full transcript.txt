Shit, the bastard's onto us. Okay... Jojo, get to bed. It's time to sleep. Big kiss. - Captain Weiss? - Yes. Sgt. Laurence Deray. - Your driver tonight. - You know Paris? I'm from Paris. Perfect. Base, this is Cabaret. Hey, Cabaret. - Tuned in. - Copy that. 'Night, Weiss. First stop, Pigalle. We're going round the clubs? A few of them. Next right. Are you armed? Yes, I'm on duty. Come on then. Wait here for me. Mister Weiss! What a nice surprise! Long time, no see. Can I get you a drink? How's business? Quiet. - Only 3 girls? - Until 2 a.m. No late-night license. I open again at 5, with 5 girls, and all the scum coming in. I'm sinking fast. It's not easy. But I can still stand you a drink. What'll it be? 5,000. 5,000? 5,000 euros. The 5,000 a week you say I get to cover this joint. Now! Don't "Mr. Weiss" me! You put the word out I'm on the take and I blow you? I never said that. Last warning. I'll close you down. Move it. Put skirts on your skanks. It works wonders. Ladies... Let's go. That's all they understand. And if he files a complaint? That I'd like to see. Rue de Richelieu. It's me. Meet me at Queenie's. On my way. Café Carmen, Rue de Douai. A quick coffee? I wouldn't say no. I hear you were at it again. Not me. Fatso with his Beemer. Had trouble with some clients. Anyway, his check bounced. Just press Play. - Captain, cuff me! - What's she done? - I've aged a year. - Queen of the night! I hate you. You have company? My driver. Evening, ma'am. Is he in? - Hey, guys! - Simon! You okay? - Paul... - Alright, Simon? My colleague tonight. Evening. Buy her a drink? With pleasure. This way. - Can we talk? - Sure. - Here. 20 grand. - Why 20,000 this time? I prefer my son outside than in. You spared him a 5-year stretch. 100g of coke. If you weren't there... I was there. Take it. I can't carry it around all night. Not tonight. Have it your way. He's a real player, your lawyer. Hate him, don't you? - You're inseparable now. - He's good. When you closed down the Russians, he got me the club, unseen. Except he saw everything. Your tax fraud, your scams... He's got your balls. No, I've got him by the balls. He fucks a gangster's wife. I can rat him out. Nice. - You didn't say... - What? - Méribel? - Thanks. My boy had great fun. Keep hold of the keys. You never go? With 10 clubs? When do I have time? Keep it up. Excuse me. Let's go. - Thanks for the coffee. - He's in a hurry. - See you, Queenie. - Night. Have a good evening. - Hey, Commissioner. - Captain. - Look! - Armani? No, I'm not packing anything. Not afraid, Lindner? Not of dying. Why do you smoke lights then? You smoke lights too, don't you? Tune into Base. Hello, Captain. How are you, Nina? You look great. I'm upright. - When did you start back? - A week ago. And the kids? At mom's. I'll pick them up next month. Thanks. Can I taste it? I saw the doctor. The tests all came back fine. You should take some time off. Hire a manager. Leave the empty bottles. I already told you. The guy'll say he had nothing. Cathy! Hit him for an extra bottle. Take it easy, Nina. See, I can't... Josy, stop working with cabbies. It's food on the table. Is that why you came? You thought it was for your pretty face? You're such a cop. I hear you smashed some glass tonight. They say I'm corrupt. Let them talk, they're full of shit. I know. Meantime, Internal Affairs camp at my door. Someone's setting me up. Who? I'll find out. Be careful. Queenie, a year older, but not blind? Stop that! - Lindner came in. Who's he with? - Garcia. - Really? - Yeah. They planned to meet? I don't know. Looked that way. They still there? - Just left. - Going where? Lindner's new club. - Not a word. - Sure. You never told me. Montparnasse. Rue de l'Arrivée. Did you volunteer for tonight? No, it was on the duty roster. You get a new driver every night? Yeah. That's good. New faces. Sometimes, it is. They're phasing out drivers for Vice. Maybe they'll phase out Vice. We annoy people. Who? Club owners? No, their customers. The VIPs. They hate being seen. And that's my job. You keep listening in. You're the boss. Don't call him. I'll go straight in. Opening Soon - Am I interrupting? - You're kidding. I ran into Jo. He invited me to see his club. Not bad, huh? Finishing the renovation? After all I laid out, I've got to. This place'll hurt me. Listen to him... - How many clubs do you own? - I'm kidding. More clubs means more all round. Captain, that's not me talking. When do you plan to open? Shit! I've gone straight. I'm in business now. Give me a chance. I swear, there'll be no thugs, no scum. Just clean, good-looking rich kids. Even I wouldn't get into my club. You mean I have to say yes. I don't mean anything. But that would be great. What do you think? Something fishy here... Hi again. Gentlemen. Stop here. Queenie, it's me. - A good night? - Yeah. You're sure they'd arranged to meet? He said he was waiting for him. Okay, right. I didn't speak to you. Course not. Take care. You too. Ever been to the Lido? - No. - Pity. The show's amazing. It's now or never. Tonight? I'll get you a good table and pick you up later. I don't know... You want to be alone? No, it was a treat for you. I'll stick with you. As you wish. Straight ahead. Come with me. Evening. Evening, Mr. Weiss. - Is he in? - In his office. Thanks. Recognize him? No. Ministry of Justice. Wait here. I'll be 5 minutes. I can't be everywhere. Keep an eye on your room. The girl in the black dress, is she for real? I don't know. I never saw her before. Feel her up. If she says no, kick them out. I'm sick of folks coming to be seen. People want their money's worth. I'm not a charity. They have no respect. May I? You don't call me. Nothing goes down at night? I tipped you off on Djanko. 3 months ago, when he was in clink. Big deal. Tell me something I don't know. Jo Lindner? - You know? - You tell me. Guy's a pain in the ass. He asked me to put his boys on the door. I can't. I've had my guys 5 years. In a swinger club, you gotta know the clientele. He's got his tribe working every club. Say, Simon... Can you tell him to back off? Me, tell him? Bullshit. He's renovating Le Cirque. He's pumping cash in 'cos he knows you'll give him a license. Is that all? Sure, what else? Alex, the powder's addled your brain! You've had a year with no license. I gotta justify it. Give me something. I'm not Lindner. I'm all alone in my office, talking to no one. So what do I do? Hold on... I'm gonna see a guy. I can't talk yet. It's big. I'll call you. A week, one month, tops. I'll take your dealer in then. Arnaud? Not him. He's cool, great blow. - Don't do that. - Just kidding, Alex. Wait here for me. Arnaud? Move your butt. Everything okay? Everything's okay. Alex is a friend of yours? Yeah. - You have a fight? - No. He owe you money? No. - When did you last see him? - Yesterday. You won't see him again. Why? Overdose. He's dead? - Fuck, he can't be. - He is. - It wasn't me, I swear. - We'll see. Did you sell 100g to Garcia's son? No, that wasn't me. Who was it? Your client died of an OD. You're in shit. Speak up. Big Abdel. Solange's dumbass gigolo? 100g? No, try again. I swear it was Abdel. You're not shitting me? No way, sir. Okay, fine. I'll tell Narcotics you never met Alex. Erase your clients' numbers from your phone. Thanks. What's with the scent? I got no choice. No smoking, so it stinks of sweat. Gentlemen. I spent all day doing those. Is Abdel around? The Baroness? She got all our panties in a wad. Good luck! Delicious! Is she here? What's up? Your mom? You're joking. She'll bury us all. If only you knew... I don't know. Abdel has abducted my son. Nounours? I'll die without him. You understand? No, you don't understand. Poodles always find their way home. The bitch wants a 1,000-euro ransom. I told you, 35 years younger is not good. That's irrelevant. You filed a complaint? No. You imagine me going to the cops like this? Where's he live? He never told me. Why are you lying? I'm not lying! Tell me where I find Abdel. - You don't give a shit about Nounours! - Robert, cut it out! How can I find Nounours without Abdel's address? The dog's 15 with a weak heart. Shut it, you skank! 30 years ago, Solange had Paris at her feet. She was stunning. I like her. See you, José. Goodnight. Okay, leaving a cab unattended. Who's for the disciplinary committee? Confucius, to the bureau. Let's go. Mr. Weiss... Not the committee. I got one warning. They'll suspend me. Abdel the gigolo, you see him tonight? Yes, he was with the hookers on Cours de Vincennes. - Have a dog with him? - A poodle. I didn't see you tonight. Scram. Ferreira! I know, you were suspended 15 days 2 months ago, you've got 4 kids, another on the way, and a castle in Portugal... Ain't life a bitch? No, cut out the Simon shit! You've got the champagne scam hanging over you and you forget me? I gave you that politician who hires hookers. That's no passport. Wake up! It's no passport. Let's go. Can you read the number of that black Merc? - That one? - Yeah. Alpha Kilo 049 Quebec Golf. I can't see shit. Wear glasses. I can't. In any club, they just steam up. All I see is fog. How old are you? 28. Abdel, the guy with the poodle, there. What do we do? We wait. Was it Solange? She knows I'll give her dog back! She owes me money. I swear she does! Listen up. The dope... The 100g. Who gave you it? - Who gave you it? - I don't know. What do you want? What are you doing? I know nothing. - Stop! I'll die! - Die, asshole! Stop! - I know nothing. - Who? Who? Mario! Which Mario? Jo Lindner's brother. He paid me to deliver the coke and call the cops. It's a set-up. They're setting up Garcia. What set-up? The Lindners'd chop me up if I knew anything. Is Jérôme on coke? He's a cokehead. I supply him. Get lost! She nearly bought it. Sonofabitch Abdel. You let him go. It's give and take. We'll get you back to Mommy. - Garcia? Weiss. - Yes, Simon? Meet me at your son's club. Alone. In one hour. It's tricky just now. Right now. I'll finish my meeting and be right there. Fine. I think we have a problem. Shit! He's OD'd. It's in the springtime of your age That you must learn to engage If you leave it any later Your regrets will be greater All together now! Let me tell you now, mother The cause of all my bother... I'll never forget what you did. What matters is he's here now. I have no more tears. Sorrow makes you beautiful. Thank you. We'd better be going. What about Abdel? He's out of your life. Did he hurt him? No, don't worry. Do what you want, but don't come crying to me. Excuse me. They want me! Baroness! Baroness! It's like this every night? Night turns life upside down. - I stay tuned? - Good idea. How are you doing? - Okay? - Fine, thanks. - Okay, Gina? - I'm good. - Your guy still rough on you? - He's in Marseille. Any shit, call me. Thanks, Simon. - Is he in? - There. In your office? Sure. Come with us. Can I smoke? Some guy gave you 100g? Who? A guy... I don't know him. You don't know Abdel? Who's Abdel? A client. A regular. Your pal hands it over and the cops arrive. Is that normal? No, but I said I didn't know him, that I'd been set up. Stupidly, I get you off. And you don't know Abdel. Ask him if he's on coke. Jérôme... That's bullshit. I don't fucking believe it! This is the thanks I get. What did I tell you? Dope, hands off! Hookers, hands off! You're dealing, too! You didn't get enough cash? You want cash? Here, take the cash! You never did anything in life. You know where I started? At the bottom! For who? For a coke-snorting prick! Dad, I swear... Get out. Go on, get out! Shit! You were right. Give him anything to do, but not at night. The damn Narcs seized the dope. Abdel's bosses will hit your son for the cash. They'll want payback. From you, too. I don't do payback. Your son screwed up. You're in it too, friend. - You paid them off? - No way. I got a guy easing the situation. Who? Jo Lindner? Leave him out of it. This has nothing to do with his club? Definitely not. In that case, it's perfect. Everything's okay. Come on, let's walk. - Good evening. - Inside. What's the problem? Police. Let's go. Take down his identity. Ladies and gentlemen, the club's closed. - Our champagne! - Mommy knows you're out? - It's harmless. - The football game's over. Move along. What's going on? - When did he start? - Today. That was his twin I've seen outside? - I can't kick him out. - You all bust my balls! Until your staff's legal, you're closed. - This'll hurt me bad. - So what? Why only me? That's a point. Tell your friends. No more of these guys outside clubs in Paris. - Someone's gonna be mad. - Really? Hey, you, come here. The grapevine's down? - We're on our way. - Beat it! Don't let me catch you here! Let's go. Z2 to Cabaret. Go ahead, Alain. Fight at the Love Boat, Quai de Montebello. Crime Squad on the way. Copy that. Light and siren. Let's wake up Paris. We hold off. Let them do their job. - But... - It won't take them long. I know their style. Vice Squad's here. We're saved. The real cops are here. Scary! Step over the blood. Can we talk? Book them all. Is there a problem? Sure. Garcia's scummy club is a pain in the ass. I asked for a 9-day closure. - You blocked it. - I did. Who do you think you are? All the top brass blocked it, too. Try a memo to the minister. A girl filmed us with her cellphone. Yeah, nothing happened. Goodnight. It's Jo. Can we meet at Etoile now? - If you want. - I'll be waiting for you. Be right there. Come with me. Hold back and don't move. I go in armed? Yep, it could get nasty. Enough is enough. We need to work. Thanks for coming. Talk. Not nice, what you did earlier. All my guys out of a job. They have families. What will they do now? Bank jobs, break-ins... Is that what you want? They can't work legally. With their records, the commission won't let them. They listen to me. But if I can't feed them, who'll they go after? Me. It's part of my job. Why don't you like me? I want to eat, not cause trouble. You're greedy and aggressive. You want a monopoly on club security. I'm wise to you. You send guys to start fights. Then you put your boys on the door and save the day. That has a name. Racketeering. It's in the big law book you never read. And it's illegal. I'm uneducated so you disrespect me? You don't learn dirty tricks at school. You're a champ. Say... You smoothed it out with Garcia's son's dealers? I had a word. You fucked them over. I did what you can't. - You scumbag. - I'm a scumbag? You are. Your gun allows you to talk like that? I have no gun. You dropped the dope at Garcia's. You got Abdel to work the whole set-up. Then you move in and sort it out. While I put out to get the kid off. And you're not a scumbag? Got nothing to say? So listen up... Renovate the club, spend the family's money. Your club... will never open. Never! It will open, motherfucker! I don't need you. Garcia's lawyer goes over your head. We don't need you. Nobody needs you anymore. My club is open. I underestimated you. We should've talked earlier. Let's go. - Yes? - It's Weiss. Yes, Simon? - Get to the Hustler. - Right away. Get there and wait for me outside. I'll need you later. Don't move. Got your passport? My ID card. Got cash? No. In the safe. Take it. Take the cash. - Your mom lives in Barcelona? - Yeah. Go there and stay there. - Right now? - Now. My club? It'll survive without you. Move it! Put him on the first flight to Barcelona. Thanks. I owe you one. - Buy you a drink? - With pleasure. Okay, Samy? Just fine. Scotch. - And you? - Coffee. Two scotches. His father. Pastis. Samy, can you close up, please? No problem. Why did you leave your gun in the car back there? I wanted to talk. With gangsters, talk matters. Even a moron won't shoot an unarmed cop. A cop isn't a badge and gun. Especially at night. They talk and I listen. I talk and they listen. They know me. I know them. That's all. It takes time to begin to understand them. It won't stop me taking my son to school later. You got any kids? Yes, a boy. Married? Yeah. In this idiot job, you need something else, something solid. Tony. Why'd you send Jérôme to my ex's? Where are you? The VIP. I'm working. I'm on my way. Take the next right and wait outside the staff entrance. Evening. Evening, captain. I'll be waiting. What's wrong with you? Your son's life was at risk. Have you lost your mind? You let Lindner smooth it out? Lindner was behind the whole thing. He had the dope delivered and called the cops. So he'd have you by the balls. If you try anything, they'll kill him. Wake up! You must be nuts. They're setting us up. You're completely paranoid. - They want to fuck us over. - Who does? Lindner. Your lawyer introduced you. So? Gorsky knows you pay me? Definitely not. It's between us. What are you thinking? Have I ever hidden stuff from you? You said you had his balls. Forget Gorsky. Whose wife is he fucking? I don't know. Mouss, his ex-driver, told me. "Ex-driver"? So you know nothing. If it's bugging you, I'll have the name in 2 days. I know what I'm doing with Lindner. Be careful. You did right to get my son out. Thanks for doing that. Porte de Clignancourt. Tata Pim! Not so loud, people have complained. Excuse me, can I use the bathroom? - Of course. - Thanks. Does Mouss still stop by? Which one? Mouss, the weaselly driver. Where does he work now? Hold on. Antoine. What's Mouss doing now? Which Mouss? The little weaselly guy. Car valet at L'Avenue. He's a car valet. Cheer up, Antoine made beef maffe. Shall I keep two portions for you? No, thanks. It's sweet of you. Well? He doesn't work here. Shit! He works at Le Cab. Is that him? He's a popular guy. Tail him. Light. Vehicle documents. I'm the valet. Please produce the vehicle registration documents. I work at Le Cab. I park the cars here. Okay, get out of the car. Please, get out. Quickly! You don't have the documents? - I have the keys. - But no documents. What is this? You were Gorsky's driver. The bastard canned me. He's fucking a gangster's wife. Who? I've no idea. Okay. You like your job? Yeah, sure. It's fine. Pretty cool... 10 euros per car. It soon adds up. Cash in hand. Meeting the stars. Great, you got it made. - It's work. - I work, too. So who is it? - I don't want trouble. - No trouble. Who? Speak up. Sandra, Little Claude's wife. Leandri? Who's in clink? If Gorsky finds out I snitched, I'm dead. He won't find out. Talk. I dropped Gorsky at hers every night. There you go. Easy. Where's her pad? 42, Avenue d'Iéna. Near the Arc de Triomphe. Can I go now? Gorsky? Weiss. The Crime Squad wants to close the Love Boat. I have to come down? Yes, I need you here. I'm on my way. I'll be waiting. Make it fast. Okay? Not too tired? No. The night drags by. Not if you're asleep. What are you doing here? You fuck Leandri's wife in his bed. You fuck your client's wife, you scumbag. Hold on... I'll get word to Leandri. You're dead. He won't be happy. - Don't! - Why not? I work for your pal Garcia. We're a team. Don't mess it up! I fuck a woman, so what? You've got a scumbag mentality. Using Lindner to screw Garcia, but you gotta screw me first! We have already. Go on, screw me! Garcia did. He screwed your ass. Ratted on you to Internal Affairs. Shut the fuck up, okay! You went too far, getting his son off. Internal Affairs was watching you. He ratted on you to save his son and all he had. You got fucked over. You don't count for shit. You're his fall-guy. Give me the keys. - You okay? - Sure. - The night's done? - No way. Laurence, a colleague. Josy. - Nice to meet you. - A pleasure. Lucky you, spending a night with him. Try it one day. There's no downtime. I've been waiting years to be asked. Champagne? What the hell is this? Welcome to the club. What's going on here? I didn't order all this. All you ordered is on the table, sir. I'm not some Russian you can con. You have to pay, sir. I'm not paying a damn cent. Call the police! You don't know who I am. I'm an attorney. Police. Outside, these girls would brush you off. Be a good boy, pay and be grateful. I can afford it, but it's a matter of principle. Find a cab. I'll show you out. I don't want a cab. Let go! In your state, I can't allow you to drive. The problem customers are the wealthy ones. This can't be an easy job for a woman. What are you doing in the dark? I forgot a document. What's going on? Nothing. Don't worry. You seem ruffled. I have problems to deal with. Garcia? Why Garcia? Not at all. Get out of Vice. - You've had enough? - Yes. - Still running a fever? - A slight one. I gotta go. I love you. Take care of yourself. You took your time. You know the type. Looking for a shoulder to cry on. I'll spare you that. Told you, the wealthy ones. Are you able to drive? Sure, I'm just fine. We'll see. Laurence, it was a pleasure. Drop by whenever. That's very sweet. It's me. I need to see you. - Breakfast? - No, right away. - Is there a problem? - Nothing serious. At La Mécanique, okay? Sure. See you there. Come with us. You can't stay there. - Thierry. - How are you, Tony? Evening, Captain Weiss. How's things? It's quiet. Take a seat? You stay at the bar? Want a drink? Espresso. You take care of it? Scotch? Greg, send over a bottle of scotch. Right away. Well? It's weird seeing you here. Your first club. The fun we had. You, with your tassled jacket and secondhand Harley. And you, with your little gray suit. Going to the store to buy the booze to dodge the taxes. Can't keep up anymore? You, taking the cash. Me, working the door weekends. We've come a long way. Seriously, I admire you. I'm proud you're my son's godfather. You see, for me, family's all that matters. And you're family. I have no regrets. I'd do it all again, no problem. Because I have only one friend. And that's you. Garcia, the Emperor of the Night. You've put on some weight, but you're the same guy. Just like me. We'll never be like anyone else. Never! Why'd you do it? Did I hurt you? Did I hurt you? Look me in the eye. - Stop. - Tell me. Stop! You want me to say I'm a shit? Okay, I'm a shit. Hit me, kick shit out of me. I'm a scumbag. I betrayed you. Yes, I betrayed you, dammit. I got fucked over. Earlier, at Le Carmen, when I called you to give you the cash, Internal Affairs were there. Gorsky struck a deal with them. They forced me to rat on you. I panicked at the idea of losing everything. Say something, dammit. - Say something. - You don't get it. Internal Affairs... If I go down, you go down too. Whatever Gorsky says, I'll go talk to them. I'll deny everything. They've got nothing on us. I never gave you money. You won't talk. If I lose it all, who cares? We'll start over. Just like before. Are you in? Simon, are you in? I'd hate to be you. Let's go. A cop has no friends. Never forget that. There's a phone booth. Pull over. It's me. Listen, honey. And don't ask any questions. Take the kid to your mother's. Yes, now. I'll explain. Just do it. I love you. A call from Base? No. Usually, there's action now. The drunks, the fights... It's the meanest hour. It was fun riding with you. I just tagged along. If you want to do it again, put your name down. I'd like that. One last thing, then home. - What do we do? - Play it by ear. Scotch. On the house. Enjoy your meal, Mr. Lindner. Mr. Weiss, take a seat. - Don't be offended if I stand. - I won't. My son said you dropped by Le Cirque. - Like it? - It's fabulous. It cost us a fortune. It's a good investment. Don't bullshit my dad. Jo, sit down. He stops us working and strolls in here... Tell me what's on your mind. I'd like you to back off my friend Garcia. Same goes for his son. In return for? You have my blessing to open Le Cirque. Why should I trust you? Tony Garcia is like a brother to me. He's lucky to have a friend like you. What's he doing here? He's my lawyer. Your lawyer? And Leandri's. Who's in jail. So he fucks his wife. He's Garcia's lawyer and fucked Garcia over. Your lawyer will fuck you over, then fuck your wife. Once a scumbag, always a scumbag. Defend yourself. Who do you trust? Me or a scumbag cop? Le Cirque? I gave you my word and I'll keep it. On one condition. Cut Gorsky loose. Dad? Shut up! The problem is solved, Mr. Weiss. That was to the limit. There are no limits. Cabaret, this is Base. Yes, Alain. The bouncer at the 400 Coups called. A bit of a rumble. They're expecting you. Copy that. I told you, the meanest hour. Well? - You can't help it, can you? - It wasn't me. It happened inside. Look at that mitt. One slap and that's it. I should know, he saved my life. - Where is he? - I hid him. The official version? A guy helped himself to the next table's bottle. The gamblers kicked him to hell and back. Sir! Police. How do you feel? Fuck you! Do you want us to call an ambulance? Fuck you! Sir, you're hurt. Fuck you! Bitch! The usual tactic. Monsignor! Thank you so much! I have residency. I'm almost French now. You should thank her. Madame! My violin! Dmitri. 1st violin at Le Sherazade. Fucker! Guys, champagne all round! Cheers, guys! Good job. Good health! Let's go home. Thank you, my public. Let's go. Okay? Yeah. I think I drank too much tonight. I'm tired. They all tire me out. I've had enough. Giving up Vice? I want to meet real people. I'm Simon. I know. That's the introductions over. Cabaret, this is Base. Yes, Alain. I read you. Shootout at 42, Avenue d'Iéna. One casualty. The lawyer, Paul Gorsky. Over. Shit! I'm on my way. Over and out. It had to happen. Captain Weiss? Good morning. Internal Affairs. I inform you that as of now, 06.47, we're taking you into custody. Your gun, captain. Are the cuffs necessary? Turn around. Internal Affairs Sit down. The chief will be here shortly. Chief. Laurence Deray, divisional chief, Internal Affairs. I'll let you in on a secret. Earlier, at the 400 Coups, with the musician and all that craziness, I nearly cracked... and told you who I was and that you should back out. But you went too far. We spent one night together. You smashed up a bar. Force-fed a dealer heroine. Sent Garcia's son to his mom's after getting him off coke charges. Negotiated the opening of a nightclub with leading underworld figures. Let's cut to the chase. One witness was crucial to me, Paul Gorsky, Tony Garcia's lawyer. He was killed after you paid a visit to Jo Lindner and made accusations against him. In your wife's presence, I searched your home. We apprehended her at her mother's. No incriminating evidence was found. To my surprise, your wife has no idea of the job you do. I interrogated your friend Tony Garcia about acts of corruption involving you. Speak up. Tony Garcia refuted his lawyer's allegations against you. You are suspended from duty until our investigation is complete. We will meet again, therefore. You're dangerous, Capt. Weiss. I'm not dangerous, my job is. Policing the police? A vocation? A choice. Maybe it's time I quit. I didn't suspect a thing. Subtitles: Simon John Subtitling: Vdm
