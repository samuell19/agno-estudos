Did you see him? He was on the main street. Any luck? Not on this side. It's a waste of time, he could have never made it to the rails. No way. I think he's holed up in town somewhere. More like lying out yonder... bleeding to death. Sure. You ever know Ben Janish to miss? Easy friend. Nice and easy. You gotta name? You surely gotta be somebody... Tearin 'em up like that. Jonas. Call me Jonas. Where's yer gun? I don't know. You don't know? Here. You look like hell. I fell like hell. What happened? I fell. I fell out of a window... You don't remember? I don't remember anything. The name is Rimes. J. P. Rimes. We're coming in to town any time now... You wanna stay, stay. I'm leavin'. That's something you done before friend. Ride the rail. Where the hell are you taking me? Walk, I talk. You ain't got time for both. Hey. You growin' roots? Whenever the law looks like closing in, I just... take off and hide out a while. And you figure on taking me with you? That's up to you. How you know I'm not a law man? A law man? I thought you was a lost man. Mighta got yourself located. Why you helpin' me? Got a helpful nature I guess. What you figure on doin'? Find the pieces... try and fit em together. Bronco fighter I knew once... landed on his head... seven, eight months before he knew who he was. Even where he was. Then all of a sudden... he could remember perfect. But he didn't want folks to realize it. Well that's not true of me. You dress like a city man. You feel like a city man. I feel like I'm wearing someone else's skin. As long as you don't get it punctured none. What are you gonna do with that? I'm gonna let 'em know we're here. And what do I do when we get where we're going? Keep your mouth shut. Here they come. The gal is Fan Davidge. The man beside her is Arch our foreman. They're good folks. Running an outlaw hideout? Who's the man running behind him? It's a long story. All you gotta know is uh... Leave Fan alone, she's spoken for. Ben Janish reckons she his gal. Janish? Janish, I've heard that name before. That's the man that shot at me. Ben Janish shot at you and missed? He didn't miss. He just didn't hit me dead center. Listen if Janish is at the ranch. Then we'll have some answers won't we? You gonna strap that on? You'll do better with this. That's something else you done before friend... handle a gun. Whoa! Oh yeah. Mount up J.B. Ain't got much time. There's two of us. He's coming along. Who's he? The law was after him. His name is Jonas. Ben don't cotton to strangers. Me neither. We leave him here. Well, the only way to do that is to leave me here a dead man. Nobody said nothin' about dyin' except you mister. We don't know you. And I don't know you. But I'm going with you anyway. No. Well, if you wanna stop me you can die now just as easy as later. This man is coming to the ranch with me. He's injured. You're the boss, ma'am. Whatever you say goes. Til Ben gets back. You lookin' to get your title in the crag. I appreciate this, Ms. Davidge. In spite of everything I still own the Rafter D. The Rafter D? I know that name. Not an outlaw around these parts doesn't. You didn't know where you were heading? I never bothered to ask. It's okay, Charlie. Bringing in Rimes and a stranger. As long as he's told it's a whole lot easier gettin' in than gettin' out. Thank you. I think before you settle in I should take a look at that wound. Hey... I'll find a bed for you in the bunk house. Unless you're looking to make other arrangements. It looks like supper's finished. But, would you like some coffee? Yeah, coffee would be fine, thanks. Rimes said you were on the run. Why? I can't tell you. I should know better than to ask questions. You know I'd like to tell you. But, I just can't remember. You can't remember anything? No. Not since Janish gave me this. Ben Janish? But, he could ride in here at any time. You knew that and... still you came here. Well, a man doesn't know who he is, he uh... he doesn't have any place to go. And is that um... the only reason? No, I uh... I just find it hard to believe that a woman like you would run a... hideout for men like Ben Janish willingly. So... Janish and his men... held up the Denver and the Rio Grande. They needed a hideout. They rode in here... shot down and drove off our own hands. Arch Hanneker... was the only one who stayed. Pa couldn't do anything. He was back east. I hoped they'd leave. But they hung on. And on. Before Pa could do anything... he had a heart attack. Hanneker and I... were left here. Stranded. Why don't you sell out? Never. The Rafter D is all I have left. Pa built it... and I aim to get it back some how. I'd go to the law... but Janish always leaves men behind. To see that nobody rides out of here. Especially me. Now you're his prisoner, too. I'm where I want to be. Good night, Ms. Davidge. Thanks for fixin' me up. My pleasure. Hey. You stay away from her. You do what you was paid for. But stay away from Ms. Fan, you hear? Paid for? Paid to do what? What do you know about me? Enough. Been expecting you. That's what you been waitin' for. I done my part. The rest is your concern. Time is runnin' out. They say you enjoys your work, mister. So go ahead. Have yourself a good time. Where's my bunk? I seen you before. That so? Yeah. I seen you before. Hell. I'm talkin' to you. Well, maybe you could remember where we met and we'll have somethin' to talk about. I don't remember nothin'. Except you was no accountin' trouble. I don't think we've met. I'd remember the smell. Okay, okay. What did you say? Well, you seem to be looking for trouble so, uh... I'll make it easy for ya. I said you smelled. Like a skunk. C'mon boy. You sure have a way with horses. Morning. Good morning. You're up early. This is the only time of the day I feel free. Free as nature first made man... when wild and woods and noble savage ran. Dryden. How the hell did I remember that. Free. Can you imagine what it is like to be a prisoner in your own home? Sometimes I wish I was a man. I would take a gun and... I wish I could help. I know. No. You don't know anything about me. I know enough. I don't even know who I am myself. Some day you might be sorry that you trusted me. I don't think so. This your horse? He's a stray we rounded up. Ride him if you like. If you'll let me. Mind if I use this? Go right ahead. Don't you go gettin' a case on that one, Ms. Fan. He's no good. How can you say that? Do you know him? No. But, I got to look out for you. I can look out for myself. I wanna see you happy with a man. The right kind of man. What makes you think Mr. Jonas isn't the right kind? I know him. Noon's a bad one. Noon? Thanks for the mount. You're welcome. You mind if I ride along with you? No, I guess I can't stop you. You figuring on gettin' out of here? There's fifty box canyons. All of 'em dead ends. There's only one way out of here and Janish got his men covering that. There's gotta be another way. - Somebody in El Paso knows who I am. - Friend. Let the dead past bury its dead. Now, Ben Janish doesn't figure he'd let himself get buried yet. C'mon'. That animal of yours sure knows this path. I got a feeling I should, too. Yeah, yeah I got the feelin' I've been here before. All I got to go on is a.. Piece of paper signed by some lawyer in El Paso, Texas named Cullane. You figure maybe I could be Cullane? You could be just about anybody. What about Ruble Noon? Well now just what the hell is so funny? Noon? Ruble Noon? Noon, Noon's a gun... For hire. So? So what. He's a killer. You got problems the law can't handle... you get Noon. What does Noon look like? All I heard was... he was tall. Blood like ice. And a hand like lightning. Why is he interesting? Unless you're figuring on... hiring Noon to... get Ben Janish. There may be somebody done that already. This is a deed to twenty acres of land and a cabin. - Drawn up by Dean Cullane, signed by Tom Davidge, and made out to... - Ruble Noon. That was handed to me by Henneker last night. He said it was in payment for a job that I had to do. So does that make me Noon or was he just expecting Noon when I rode in with you. If that animal of yours could talk some... He knows you. I think he could remember that. Here! Here, come back here'. Damn horse. Now, how the hell did he get up there? How the hell are we gonna get up there? Well... if I had to guess... them's your acres. And there's your cabin. The man who built this sure knew what he was doing. Hey... look at this here. That's the sort of musket Rivera carried when he came through here in the 1700's. Well, a man's gotta leave some trace of his passing. Papers, letters. Something. Find anything? All figures. There's figures, but they run into thousands of dollars. And by each entry, initials. Always the same. Yours? Not unless you spell Ruble Noon with a 'J' and an 'M'. Hey'. Ball ammunition. For muzzle loaders. One and sixteen to the pound. Locks. That's a concern you wouldn't understand. Black Storm's Come and Terms of the Law. Only seems like the kind of reading a hired killer would keep. Mr. J here must be one of them, uh... intellectuals. Yeah, what the hell am I? That could fit. And the house fits. Where do I fit? I don't believe that. Well, I'll be hornswoggled and spayed. You still say there's no way out of that valley? You ain't aimin' to ride that thing? Watch me. You comin'? Yeah. I figure you might need me. If only to put a mark on your grave. He's alright. Anybody been around? I've got a feeling we gotta catch a train. We? Now what? Now we wait. Climb aboard. We're running behind time. What about the horses? Same as usual. Load 'em up and get a move on. Never could figure it out. Nobody never gets on here, excepting you. He's the only man I know with his own railroad station. My friend is full of surprises. Aren't you, friend? Where you headed this time? El Paso. It'll be day light. So? So, you'll want to get out at the usual place, I guess? Yeah, yeah the usual place. C'mon. Mister. I'd wait until dark 'fore you head town. Words out on you. I reckon you're expected. Now there's somebody I gotta see. Day before yesterday This same run, I brought his body back. Now I don't know what your fight with him was, but... Whose body? Dean Cullane. You got so you can kill a man and not remember? Ah, we'll rest up here until sunset. Well, you took your time about it. What the hell were you doin'? Watchin' Ruble Noon give a shootin' lesson. Sonofabitch. I think that brakeman was right. Ben Janish was sure layin' for you. Still goin' into El Paso? I have to. Ever think maybe you did kill Dean Cullane. You got room for our horses? Si senor. Fifty cents. Each. That'll do fine. Do you know a man named Cullane. Dead, senor. We heard. Where was his office? Across the road, above the saloon. But, be careful, senor. Cullane may be dead, but the answers still up in that office. Anybody comes, whistle. Hey, Rimes'. Hey, Gus Wagner. What are you doing in town? Wanna have a drink? Yeah, sure. What are you doing in my brother's office? Your brother? I'm Peg. And you're trespassing, you know? Who are you? My name is, uh, Jonas. Oh. This is my brother's chair. He always sits here. Do you like it? Yes. Very nice. And this is Dean's bible. I want to have it with me. At the funeral. We're burying him tomorrow, you know. No, I didn't. I'm sorry. Mr. Jonas? What's in this office that's so important to you? I'm afraid I don't know. I don't know, either. But, whatever it is, it's important enough that somebody tried to gun me down. Who? My only clue is a document drawn up by your brother. Why would anyone want to kill you? I don't remember anything before that shot at Kiowa Flats. That's where Dean was killed. He went there to meet with Ruble Noon and Ruble Noon shot him down in cold blood. I begged Dean not to go. Everyone knows Noon's a killer. He's trying to kill me, too. I don't think that uh Noon would kill a woman. Would you like to see my brother? Well, thank you Ms. Cullane, but I don't want to intrude on your time of sorrow. It might help you. He's waiting for us. Ms. Cullane. Oh Judge, nice of you to come. A sad business. Laying in always means grief. But when it's a fine young man struck down in his prime. Um... This is Mr. Jonas. Jonas Mandrin. Good to know you, Mr. Mandrin. Ms. Cullane. Thank you, Judge. The judge is a good man. And he's been great comfort in these last few days. Over here. I hope that seeing my brother just might bring your memory back. Mr. Ruble Noon. What made you sell out? Money. Which you're going to help us find. We want answers to a few questions, Noon. I told you I can't remember anything before Kiowa Flats. Christobal will help you remember. He's an expert. Feel free to scream. There's no one to hear. Christobal! Get after him'. C'mon, get out there. Get after... You have a problem, Mr. Mandrin? Somebody tried to kill me, that's all. Join me. A judge's home should be sanctuary enough. I heard the shot. I must say I was expecting something of the sort. Expecting it? Uh huh. Even though you took the precaution of calling yourself... Jonas Mandrin. Well, did you uh... expect me to announce myself as... Ruble Noon. Well... under the circumstances, no. My only... surprise was why you should choose that particular name. Oh, it's the... first thing that came into my head. - And if I did kill Dean Cullane... - You didn't. What? You had no motive. Well, then... why did she try to have me killed. To stop you from telling Fan Davidge where the money is. What money? Oh, I think you could use a drink. We both could. You see Mr. Noon... I was Tom Davidge's friend. And his attorney. When he suffered business reverses in the east... and the wolves were snapping at his tail... well, I advised him to convert everything he had into gold. There could be as much as a... quarter of a million dollars... hidden somewhere on the Rafter D. So, Tom Davidge trusted you to get rid of Janish and his men. You know about this? Mmhmm. He asked me to draw that up. But, uh... you're known for... methods more violent than I could lend myself to. Now, I don't mean to sit in judgment, you understand. Anyway... Tom left the negotiations to Dean Cullane. Who told his sister. Who in turn, I suspect, told Janish. In exchange for his help in getting rid of you. When Dean Cullane told his sister about that money, well the poor fool dug his own grave. So, she had him killed before she could tell Fan and me about the money. Mmhmm. Thank you, Judge. I better get back to the ranch. You be careful. The female of the species is more deadly than the male. Don't underestimate Peg Cullane. She has a powerful ally in Janish and she is hungry for that money. The back way, I think. I would recommend the railroad for safety. Tom Davidge owns stock and built part of it. They'd do anything for Tom or his family. Somebody else falls into place. Well, thanks Judge. Hold it there, senor. Drop the saddle. Slowly. Your gun belt, senor, drop it. With your right hand. It's not polite to keep a lady waiting. Especially when you are so eagerly expected. Since you have questions still to answer it would be a pity to kill you. Jonas! Rimes brought me here. I should've gunned you down in El Paso. And I want you alive. You're worth five hundred dollars to me. Five hundred dollars? Dead or alive. To find out whether you're dead or alive, mister. According to this telegram that's the reward offered by the Mandrin Arms Company. For information leading to the whereabouts of their founder and president. You. Jonas Mandrin. J.M. I got take care of you. No thanks to you there were two corpses in that funeral parlor. Ben Janish had shot you dead if I hadn't... accidentally spoiled his aim for him. You mean until you decided to hunt the gold for yourself. Yeah. Gold? What gold? It's all hidden somewhere on this ranch. There's a quarter of a million dollars in gold. But, that's not possible. He was ruined. Pa told me himself the Rafter D was all he had left. Now he won't even have that if Janish has his way. Jonas! Now there's only one way out of here. Or in. He wasn't alone. Janish and Cherry, move out. I'll go outside and scout around. You cover the house. Hey, friend. Try to stay alive, will you? Several shots. I reckon Dave's got his. You can't know that. I know Dave. He don't shoot unless he got his man dead to right. They don't have no chance to fire back. We just gonna sit here? Unless one of you big heroes makes a move, nobody is going to get a cent. You said Noon was good and dead. He will be. You're as good as dead. But, I'm not gonna kill ya. Turn around and go back. Can't do that. My fight's with Janish. They said you never gave anybody a break. Maybe you're the exception. I guess I'll walk. Who are... Godless bastard. Noon! You did just what I hoped you'd do. You lead us straight to the money. Now, you're just in the way. I knew I'd have to kill you myself when the time came. Jonas? Jonas. Daddy. Daddy. Jonas. Gold. Sixteen to the pound. How the he... Did you know that was there? I put it there. You remembered. Everything. Your a... your wife? And the child. Rimes. His wife and daughter were both murdered. While he was in New York. Mandrin just disappeared. Turned up later as Ruble Noon. From then on in he's been waging his own kind of personal war. Getting the kind of people that killed his family. I'm sorry about your family. Now, don't have any illusions about me, Fan. I'm still Ruble Noon until I finish the job I was paid to do. Noon'. We know you got Fan Davidge in there. You don't want to see her hurt. Come out with your hands up. And we'll make a deal. They can't afford to let any of us go. We know too much. You have my word. Share and share alike. Are you crazy? Larry, go to Hell! You'd have split the gold with them? Ride 'em in. It's Henneker. You should've listened while you had a chance. Ms. Davidge? You better tell him to do what I say. Or I'll gun Henneker down right here in front of your eyes. I'll give you exactly a count of five. One. Two. Three. Don't do it, Ms. Fan. Don't trust these lyin' bastards. Four. Five. You miserable sons of stupid! He said he'd always look out for me. I guess he did at that. Here they come. That'll get 'em out like roaches from the rafters. Hey, Fan. What the hell you gonna do? I'm gonna try to get up top. Don't do it! It's the only way to spring their trap. You be careful up there. I got some money riding on you. They'll never see us through that. Move out! Boyd, Trails, take the right flank. They gotta be half dead by now. Come back here! You wouldn't shoot a woman. You haven't got the guts. But, I have! I'd shoot you and I'd enjoy it. Murderous bitch'. Jonas! Jonas! Well... that's the end of Ruble Noon. Always said I'd put a mark on your grave. Somethin' else you said. "Let the dead past bury its dead." Well all that's past. And buried. When you two come out of that slushy haze I got my reward comin'. From a Mandrin Arms Company. Yep. Now, there's no going back. I found what I want right here. Yeah, but I found our boss for him. Five hundred dollars. Yeah, well I got a thousand dollars that said you just lost him again. Wonder where he thinks he's gonna get the money?
