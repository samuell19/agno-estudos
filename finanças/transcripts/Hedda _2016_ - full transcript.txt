*SOUND OF THE SEA* Well, Come on! *JUBILATION, DOG BARKING* *DOG BARKING* Come, Cookie, come! *SHE LAUGHS* Come on. Come on, run. *SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LAUNGAGE* *SOUND OF THE SEA* Well finally. I was worried about you. - Ha? - Where were you for so long? Worry, Worry. Come here. Hedda! Who knows what kind of infections he has. - Delicious! - You're all wet. Come along, come. She asked if we would be back in the summer. And? Are we coming? No. This is our Honeymoon trip. - I like it here. - Caribbean or somewhere else. This is not a place for a honeymoon. - Say: What are you doing here? - That's how I'm and that's how I'll stay. Can you ask her if I can buy the Dog from her. - You want to take the dog with you? - Yes. For our house. As a watchdog? - Are you serious? - Yes! Please! Maybe you will come with us. *HE SPEAKS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE* Make her a bigger offer. Ask her again. And? Bye. Cookie. Take care. So what is that? Hedda, we are here. wake up. No. Wake up. - Is that the gate? - Yes, we are here. Oh, cool. - Wait. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Come here. Come. So here. Wait a moment. No. Wait. - Can I open my eyes? - Yes. Oh, wow! Wow, this is great! Hmm. It fits in well here. Also good. Very good. Is this the colour we choose? - Obviously. - No? The pictures don't look good here anymore,right? They dont't fit. - You think? - Yes. They are a little .... - Well ..... - Then we can change them. - Do you like it? - Yes, very much. - And you look good too. - Come, let's go upstairs. This will be a surprise for me too. Geez! It doesn't look good here? When will they finish this? - This week. - Fully finished. Ah really? Yes. We cannot repair the roof until next year. And what do we have here? - The nursery. - Aha. Everything looks worse than it is. And here? Well, a children's room. By the way, and where is the bedroom? This way, this way. Careful! Don't slip! Here! Here, here, here! Here! That's done. Uh. (Julle) Huhu. Good Morning. (Julle) Don't you hear that ring? Hello. Are you still sleeping? (Julle) Would you put water in there please? - Aunt Julle? - Jorgen. - Hi, that's a surprise. - Ah, how nice. - How was it? - It was nice. - I'm glad. - Only the weather was bad. - Oh, I'm sorry. - well. Thank you for taking care of everything in the last few days. You know I love real craftsmen. Oh, you. - Hedda - Hello - Was it nice? - Yes, very. Pun! May I introduce: This is Pun. Its not her real name. Her real name is long and complicated. I shortened it to Pun. - And now everybody calls her that. - And what happened to Elena? Ah, Elena, Ah. She got on my nerves, I sent her away. (whispering) The flowers are hideous. I mean, she never cleaned either. But my Pun, she really is the very best. I find it very difficult to part with her. I think my boy, you have a great help. Right here in this half-finished house. Thank you very much. Jorgen, you have decided all of this. Thank you! You work way too much. And Hedda wants to study again. Oh ... She has only been in Europe for six months, first Italy, then here. - Speak Italian? - No, I don't speak Italian. That's why she doesn't speak good German and is ashamed. She understands every German word, almost every German word, No matter how fast you speak. Then to begin with, we will speak a little slowly. Welcome to the Tesman family. I'll take your things off. And show you the room. It's this way. I already told Pun that you wake up late in the morning. But after such an exhausting honeymoon, One is sure to be exhausted. Pun gets six euros an hour, plus boarding and lodging. Its just because of the change. I'll manage the household by myself. Where did you put the lemon squeezer? Did you check the shelf? There in the drawer? Look here. Yes here. There it is. Thank you. The journey was not exausting. It was just too short. And it was inexpensive. Very clever of Jorgen. The house construction is devouring all his money. Yes, but a wedding without a honeymoon, is like a marriage without a wedding night. I think Pun will be a very good nanny. Yes! I mean she has four children. She knows how it's done. Does your aunt always have to kiss you on the mouth? Why not? She is like a mother to me. Mothers don't kiss their children on the mouth. Especially not if the child is over 40. Typical Hedda. During the vacation she kept dumping sand in our bedroom. You wanted to give up smoking. Oh, what for? It's nice of you to smoke outside the house. Yes, Hedda is very sensitive. Now my little Jorgen is a married man. You finally caught Hedda. Yes, everyone envies me. And any prospect of a good news? well I'm your aunt. What about your promotion? Yes, there is something in prospect. If everything goes well, I'll take over the neurology department. My boss is moving into his house on Elbe. He made enough money. He can enjoy it. I still have to work a bit before I can go to the sea with her. You have a beautiful house here and very close to me. Luckily not on the Elbe. My new work is getting published. Won't they get past me anyway. - This is still your present. - Julle, you are crazy. - You shouldn't give me anything. - I support my only child. You've already put so much into the house. Where is it? *BEEP AND QUIET ENGINE NOISE* - Oh God! - I'm going to the clinic. I'll get wine and champagne on my way back. - Do you need anything else? - No, I ... I'm going to town anyway. - How? - Ah, by bike? - Down the hill is fun. - The bike moves fast. I can do all the shopping very easily with the car. I think I'll sign up again at the driving school. Sometimes I have fun driving a car. You failed the test three times now. You have to accept that sometimes. You can do a lot of other things wonderfully. - If necessary you can take a Taxi. - A Taxi? - Do you know about our finances? - No more problems after I get the Chief's post. You don't have the job yet. Brack won't keep me hanging. He likes us. - He'll sort it out. - No. He likes me. That's the sad truth. (Brack) So. How are you, what's up? May I itroduce Mrs. Belzheim. - Good day doctor. - Forgive the intrusion. Here's our indispensable woman, Dr. Beewen. Our experienced Dr.Feindt and our talented lady Dr. Drews. Sorry, that wasn't my intention. (Brack) Last, but not the least, our dear colleague Dr. Tesman. He does a lot of research. What are you working on right now? I'm investigating the trigger mechanisms of the nociceptive systems. - and therapeutic approaches. - That will be enough. Beautiful people in the background, everyone wants to have a fancy car and a big house by the sea. But before that can happen, you have to study a little medicine. You. Yes, hey there. Come. Come to the front. - What's your name? - Sarah. Dear Sarah, how do you interview a patient? Excuse me, it seems urgent. Excuse me. (Brack) We will continue. Thea. Hello. - Hello - Mrs. Tesman? - Yes. - Good day. - Your husband bought this earlier today from the photo gallery. - Aha. No. This is nonsense. Mmmh! Not yet. Yes? That's really very bad. Yes, I'm cooking right now. *PUN SPEAKS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE* Excuse me? You don't need to hang up because of me. Were you talking to your children on the phone? Yes? Four. Wow! Such a big family. Quite the Mom. Excuse me. Can you help me? Here we are. This place was a complete ruin. The city was about to knock it down. "Always go with God's blessing, this house - a valued German item. In it devotion and righteousness blossoms. with love and faithfulness of the German race." This house was built with love by a Nazi officer before the end of the war, by using Russian and Polish prisoners of war. Immortalized in the celler with inscriptions. And after the war? The guy fled to Argentina with his family. Refugee families from Sudetenland lived here. - Over 14 families. - How do you know all this? If something interests me, I don't give up. I'm just curious. You know. Why did you cut off your curls? You too have less hair .... and glasses. First it was a meal only for his boss, and now more and more are coming. Do you have a computer at home? Yes? Take my laptop And you can skype with your children. Skype. Yes. - A surprise. - Hello. Across the ocean straight to our dinner table. - Welcome back to the province, Thea. - Thank you. But Boston too is province. Very much my province. - Want something to drink? Cognac? - No. Sherry. - I'll have sherry too. - Where is your man? Jeff is a typical American who thinks Europe is terrible. - No air conditioning, parking. - And the children? The children go to school. Jeff can take care of the children. - Your hair looks good. - Oh. Thank you. Ten years passed and you still look the same. Well eleven. or to be completely honest, it's eleven and a half. The two of you have hardly changed. Yes? I hope so. Hedda? Hedda. Come here. I've already told Jorgen everything. It's about Eilert. - Are you talking about Eilert again? - Yes. He's your friend. We were colleagues. He always spoke so much about you. You must know that. He always says,"Jorgen is very reliable". Aha. - Yes? - Yes. It's true. Cheers. Thank you. And what did Eilert do with you in America? He wanted a fresh start in Boston. And of course with you. No. I think I was really done. I think I was kind of a go-to address for him. - He didn't know anyone over there. - What is he doing over there? - Does he still work as a neurologist? - He writes and writes. Our house is big enough. So we rented him a room. He was never satisfied with what he wrote. He took real good care of Jeff's children. Yes. He's a shining example. We didn't hear anything from him the whole time. He was very withdrawn, all he wanted was to complete his study. - What kind of study? - This will be his best book. And I was allowed to help him. Haven't you read the article in "THE PROGRESS"? Here. It's only a small excerpt. We got a lot further. And what did Jeff think about this friendship? My man? Yes, he only thinks about the best for everyone, no matter what you do. That's why we did it. From being the nurse for his sick wife, to becoming his wife. - Perfect. - That sounds like real love. You can tell Hedda. She'll find out anyway. What? Jorgen, what? Hello. Did you leave your husband? For Eilert? What was I supposed to do? Jeff can do without me, Eilert can't. That's why you travelled to Europe after him? - He was suddenly gone. - Yes, that's his specialty. He makes me feel special. He can do that. But why will he come back here? - Well, he needs friends, who will take care of him. - Aha. - He should leave us alone. - Please believe me, he's not the same anymore. Brack is coming here tonight. Jorgen, you'll be the boss soon. Ask him to reinstate Eilert. Otherwise he won't get it. He needs this. You are welcome to talk to Brack during dinner, but I'll not beg for a competitor. Please understand that. No. It's going great. Yes. Yes, but come after a little past eight. By that time they will be a little tipsy. Hmm. Because I don't want it! Hello darling, it's me again. Please give me ... Yes. No! He will be talking to me! Give ... Pass the phone to him! Jeff! - Brack. - Jorgen. I'm famished. Be patient. We can have a drink first. - Leave your shoes on. - Thanks. Fancy ...... Fancy. Everything that's good and expensive is inside your house. - Yes, Hedda likes beautiful things. - I can see that. But, "Slow and steady wins the race." One step at a time. Are there uncertainties? There are always uncertainties, Jorgen. - Hedda. - You look great. The light can be deceptive. I'm more of a night creature. I'm also known as the prince of darkness. - And yet so brown. - I'm often at my house on the Elbe. - Isn't she gorgeous? - Today, it's not about me. Who else if not her? Hello. Where should I look first? - Thea Collister. - Brack, like the brackish water. - Thea is visiting from Boston. - Hmm. Aren't you Jorgen's ex-lover? - Yes. Everything has its time. - Come with me. We have known each other. With them, I have .... "This experiment is based on the consultation, consisting of the group A, comma, ... .... Materialism as a core position of the brain. Long-term observation, .... .... research into specific objects." Jorgen didn't allow me to smoke inside. That's why we are standing here. Secretly? I don't smoke regularly, but I need it right now. - Don't you have a fire? - No. As a student you smoked a lot. Not only that. I probably tried everything, both legal and illegal. You were by far my best student. How could you be so stupid and give it all up? That was a good decision. You would have overtaken your husband. You just want to be charming. I'm interested in psychiatry. I enrolled into a distance learning course. And now you are sitting here on this hill behind your books. Life is down there. - I'm tired of dancing around. - What? - I'm tired of dancing around. - You are still young. I have my memories ... What do you remember? Everything was possible and nothing was enough. - And now? What's next? - The future. - With Jorgen you are ... - He loves me truely. And he has a bright future. well ... ..... forever and ever - to be with the one and only person - until death do us part. From morning to night- yes, at any time. That's called love. And that from your mouth. I was probably the only student in your semester, you didn't get to fuck. That's a nice thought, but you overestimate me. Before marriage, dear Hedda, I had a certain respect. But in reality you are a little bastard. I only wish a small circle of close friends, where I can come and go, like a true and understanding friend. - A friend of the house. - And the housewife in particular. Basically a triangular relationship, a great convenience for every participant. I appreciate your offer. The triangle is complete. *PUN AND HER CHILDREN TALK IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE* *PUN KISS HER CHILDREN* Jorgen, back then, were you in Boston or ... - I was in Chicago. - Oh, Chicago. These are the twins, Lucinda and Maggie. This is my husband, Jeff, at a golf tournament. That's the oldest,Trish, she's from his first marriage. Can I please? Is that the oldest? - Yes. - Wow! Beautiful. - One moment. This is Jeff? - Yes. - I remember him differently. - He had long hair. - I imagined him differently. - Once you sent me a photo. Where is she from ... What's her name? - Pun - Pun. She's from ... I don't know. Where is she from? Aunt Julle brought her. - She looks Indian. - A Kurdish mix, I think. - She comes from the Orient. - I don't know. Congratulations, bon appetit. - This is barley risotto with beans. - Aha Hm, Good? Thanks. - Mushrooms. - Delicious. I love mushrooms. - There are no mushrooms in it. - Delicious. - Hm? Hm? Who might that be? - I didn't invite anyone else. - Pun? Can you open the door please? Thank you. It might be aunt Julle. - I said nothing. - One of her surprise vists. Eilert Lovborg. How is he? Doesn't he live near here? Yes, that's just miserable. Good evening everyone. (Brack) Eilert, you old globetrotter. Boston is not the world. Hedda - What a surprise. - I know, I'm not invited. - Eilert. - Jorgen. - Great. Pun? We need another plate. - You keep surprising us. - Hello Thea said you're back for good? - Yes. I want that. - That is very reasonable. Many thanks. I'm reading your article. What would you like to drink, Eilert? Water. A glass of red wine for me. - Sparkling or regular? - Regular please. Thank you. I'll finish reading it later and .... Save yourself the trouble. It's not worth it. - Why do you say that? - I was just describing observations. You were praised worldwide. This is your breakthrough. Observations are difficult to criticize. (Brack) Very sensible. Do we have to talk about work while eating? I wanted, feedback from the scientific community. Not awkward. My God, this is delicious. Once our work ..... I mean, when his study, i.e. the book, is finished, then .... What is the study about? - A future development. - Eilert has conquered pain. - I'm working on the same topic. - Yes, I know. Don't forget to eat amidst your intellectual talks. The food is getting cold. - I heard that you want to give a lecture about it? - Yes, I want to. Where, here at the university clinic? - Don't judge me, Jorgen. - No. I know you are feeling weird. Yes, I can't ask you that ... But I'll wait. Wait? Until after your promotion. Don't you want to apply for the same post? No. No. Eilert only needs a permanent position. Yes, Brack, what do you think about that? It's like a horse race. Only one horse can win. - Yes, yes indeed. But .... - You've been hit by lightning. It's a thunderstorm. The brain already feels the pain, long before the body does. Very wise of you. They should race too, and win my job. Can you open the door again please? Thank you. *SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE* Um, Excuse me? Hello? *SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE* - Thank you. - That was funny. - Yes, he was probably one of the construction workers. - I feel tipsy. - Thank you. - Please. My pleasure. - Eilert? - Not for me. Thank you. A small glass of wine, it's not poison. - Do you want some? Of course. - A little maybe. - Do you have anything else to drink? - Of course. Come with me. Does it taste good? - This one here? - (Brack) Yes. We have some whiskeys here. - This one is a bit peatier ... - Something clear. Something clear. This one here? - Thea, Eilert, what do you want? - I'll take a sherry. I'll be right back. - Which one? - (Brack) Cultural history. - This cultural history? - Yes. - Good. Well then. - (Brack) Cheers. And now? Maybe something happened to him. - I'm going to look for him. - You are embarrassing yourself. Isn't the comission meeting about your successor? - I have all of them under control. - Does Eilert have a chance? If his book is only half as good as his article in "THE PROGRESS". He'll be a successful man. He's too unstable for a management position. He has changed. I'm going to look for him now. - An alcoholic will always remain an alcoholic. - He's sober. - I don't even want to know about the other things he comsumes. - I kind of like him. (Giggling) What are you doing? Eilert! Eilert! Here. I just wanna dance. I want to dance. Come. - Just dance .... - No! I don't want to! Fucking shit! Jorgen .... Jorgen, I ... People! Lets dance. - Ah, this looks delisious. - Thank you. I'll start going to the driving school again. I have a little surprise. (Brack) Cigars? For you. - That's what you wanted. - Looks nice. - Very nice. - For my beautiful wife. And my new job. Open up. I want to know what's inside. Oh no. It's beautiful. Thank you. I had it restored and .... - .... had your initials engraved: H T. - H T. Can I see it? You have nothing to fear in the house, when I'm on a lecture tour. I inherited it from my dad, and he from his. - Your grandfather was a general, - Like his father? Nazi. Not my father. He wasn't interested in politics. Oh, sorry. Thank you. He was rather apolitical for a gun fanatic. At 14 he took me to a shooting range, when my friends had ballet lessons, I was shooting guns with my dad. - There is of course no ammunition in it. - Pun. Anyone else up for a cognac or some other drink? I'm sorry. Vodka. I'am sorry. I probably swapped the glasses. The gun is wet. - Oh, did you ... - Yes, this is mine. Thank you. ..... Such an experience. This newely founded experimental pain theory looks at pain synoptically in the context of all facets. ..... synoptic with every pain sensation and its consequences of action. The result shows that not only the objective pain stimulus decides on the subjective perception of pain, but that the descending pain ..... - Thea, you are boring us. - No. This is genius. - I'm praising you. - Continue reading. - Don't read any further. - I find it exciting. - No. - It's sound very philosophical to me. It's about pain, how to fight it. It's simply about chemical compounds. You break everything down to chemical compounds. - No love. - It's just chemistry. One can smell oneself or one can't smell oneself. Hedda? Hedda, will you show me your wedding dress? - Please. Please. Please. - Oh, what nonsense. - I couldn't attend your .. - Wedding. Go upstairs and check it out. - Please. - No. - Help me. Please. - I didn't wear one. - Stop it, that's nonsense. Stop now. - Come. Man, you are a stupid. Eilert, don't drink so much. You are not used to it anymore. Now you want to be my mother? Luckily she's dead. Oh. (Brack) Oh, that is a beautiful wedding dress. Didn't you wear the dress on your wedding day? - Put it on. - Yes exactly. Wear it again. - Come on. - That's a good idea. (Jorgen and Brack) Wear, wear, wear ... Here is a threesome. Do you wanna dance? - Me? - Yes. - Yes. - Then you have to get into the mood first. - Hold this. Hold. - Ok. If you really love me as much as you say you do, then finish the glass in one go. - The whole glass of cognac? - Without stopping. - Eilert, you are drunk. - Be quiet Hedda. - I can speak for myself. - Yes. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, okay, Come on. A little bit more. Come on. Drink. Drink. Come on. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Wow, it was disgusting. Wow! Come on, let's dance now. - Ok. - All okay? - Yes, of course. - Come. Come. That's a good idea. I also want to. Hedda, may I have the honour? *SPEAKS IN A FOREIGN LAUNGAGE* Undress! Undress! No! No! Easy. Easy. - What are you doing here? - Hedda. - It smells crazy in here. - Should I beg Brack for a job? Why should I work in this shitty place? Ha? - You made a copy, right? - No What do you want to achieve by this? Hurt me? Or you? Why didn't you choose me? - Oh God! Why? - I didn't decide against you. You ran away. You left me. You took away our child. Now you suddenly want one? Back then you said nothing. "Keep it or don't keep it." Now you suddendly want it back and criticize me? - What should I've done? - Is that a serious question? - What? - Keep it? Keep it, Eilert? Let's run away. - Please. - I don't want you anymore. - Let's run away! Please! - I ..... Eilert, I ...... What? What then? Please stay with me. Please, I can't live without you. - Stop it! - Please! - This shitty self-pity! Stop it! - I can't live without you. Just kill yourself. Eilert! Kill yourself! When someone says fire, but it doesn't burn, then nobody believes him anymore. Hello! Good Morning! They will pick him up in two hours. At least he didn't suffer. (Brack) No pain. Does anyone want something to eat? Such a gifted and talented guy. - The wick burned at both ends. - We have to get his book out. We must do that for him. He destroyed everything. There are no copies. I have a lot of his handwritten notes in my computer. We basically wrote the book together. But you are a nurse. You never studied anything about it. I understood everything while working with Eilert. Jorgen, I can't do it without you. - You can be the editor and write the introduction. - I could comment on it. I'm working on the same topic. Scientifically that sounds a bit adventurous. It would be his thoughts. I knew him. - Why didn't he write a farewell letter? - He did. There is a farewell letter? It is a good evidence for the police. - Why didn't anyone show me the farewell letter? - Hedda. What does the letter say? - Why didn't you tell me about the letter? - Calm dowm. You aren't mentioned in the letter. I'm not mentioned? But I have a right to read the letter. It will only hurt you. - There is only one name in it. - What? Whose? My name. Where are you going? Hedda, I understand you. You couldn't carry around a child in your stomach. He killed himself. My God. You are trembling. There is no other reason. Your husband will be my successor. Then all your financial worries will be over. You will be able to enjoy your nice house and your marriage. And you can travel. You can visit me on the Elbe. But for now, I'll be here, near you for a few months. I spoke to Jorgen. He found the idea .. our friendship of three very modern. It'll be like when we were young, when we were students. The boundaries of friendship will melt away .... and love. - You really are a monster. - I wouldn't say that now. After all, I slept as soundly as a dead man ... I didn't even hear the gunshot. At least that's how I'll tell the police. Or will something change my mind? "What happens to us is what Descartes thought was impossible: He was mistaken about the existence of sensory perception." - Is there something like that, what did he mean? - It's incredibly beautiful here. Yes. Jorgen, I just spoke to your wife. SUBTITLES BY KAUSHIK KAMAL GOGOI
