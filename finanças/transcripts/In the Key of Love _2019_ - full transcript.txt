Good morning, Maggie. Hi, Sasha. Those look great. Thanks. I'm just trying to stay on top of all these weddings we have coming through. And we have another one arriving this afternoon. Right. It's gotten difficult to remember whose wedding I'm shooting. Well, luckily, I'm great at my job. You just need to show up and take your beautiful photographs. Deal. You know I could help you with this mess. I am a wedding planner, I do organize for a living. Evelyn bingewatched all these videos of the joys of organizing, so now she wants me to go through all the old boxes she has in storage. Your guitar. Yeah. She's really cleaning house. Does this mean we're finally going to get a Maggie Case concert? It's not really something I do anymore. Well, that's a shame. When was the last time you played? Not since I left Nashville. You must miss it. Let's go. I... I got a call from MVR Events in Seattle, and they want to know if I'm interested in heading up their corporate event division. That's huge! Yeah. Congratulations? I guess. I mean, I've always wanted to be in charge, I just always thought it would be here. Have you told Evelyn that plan? Every time I try to bring it up, she changes the subject. I mean, don't get me wrong. The last three years being her assistant have been great, but being an assistant isn't my passion, and that's too long to be doing something that isn't your true passion. Yeah. That's... that's important. Alright. We are ready to record this. Now, you can hear Ashleigh likes to play with the rhythms on this, and I really want to match that. Like this, okay? You sound good, Jake. Hey, everyone. It's Ashleigh. I just wanted to poke my head in to see how it's going. It's going great, and as soon as we lock these harmonies down, we'll be ready to mix. Good, because the album has to drop on the 27th or it messes up the tour and everything. It'll be ready. Trust me. I love your energy. You know, my manager thought I was crazy to hire you. But I think you're gonna prove him wrong. I'm glad I took a chance on you. Yeah, well, I'm... I'm glad you did, too. Okay, yeah, let's... Let's make it a good one, yeah? Stand by for playback. Go ahead. Jenn, I checked. The flight is on time. I know it's the only ferry today, but I have plenty of time to catch it when I land. I promise I won't miss it. I love you, too. Bride having some pre-wedding jitters? She's just worried I'm going to miss the ferry to Piedmount Island. Apparently, it runs on some crazy schedule, Hey, good work today. Give me those mixes, I'll send you back my notes. - Will do. - See ya. Everything okay, Nana? Fine... And what did I tell you about calling me "Nana" at work? Right. At work, you're Evelyn. Thank you. I do not look nearly old enough to have a granddaughter your age. You're practically my sister. You are not so funny. And aren't you supposed to be over at Tricia's doing a shoot for the brochure? I'm on my way there now. You need to finish it and get to the ferry on time to photograph it coming in. I've got plenty of time. Sasha, why don't you give her a lift over to Tricia's so she's not late? I thought we were going to narrow down room layout options for the Blake wedding next month? Already took care of it. Okay. I guess I'm your ride. Bye, Nana. Okay... Is it the flowers? Is it me? Am I not photogenic? You're absolutely photogenic. I'm just... I have an idea. Trust me. This isn't selling any flowers. I want you to create the arrangement. I just did. No... Like, actually do it. Just get into your flow. Don't even think about me or the camera. Alright. - Okay. - Yeah. Good. That's beautiful. Perfect. - Hi. - Hi. It looks great, Tricia. See? Photogenic. So, when do I get to do flowers for your wedding? My wedding? You need a fianc√© before you can get married. Well, you know, my son, Oscar, is still single. And just a ferry ride away. Good to know. Speaking of which, we need to get to the dock. Right. We'll have a mock-up of your brochure in a few days. Bye. Thanks. This is so beautiful. I'm so excited. Jenn, this is something special. Isn't it? Also, isn't this the cutest little ferry boat you've ever seen? Yeah. How did you find this? I have my ways. So pretty. Colby and Robertson wedding. I'm going to go check everyone in. It can't be. Hi, everyone. Hi. Welcome to Piedmount Island, where one week of tradition brings you a lifetime of love. I'm Sasha, and I'm here to check in all the arriving guests for the Colby and Robertson wedding. Hi. Jake Colby. Hi, Jake. Welcome to Piedmount Island. If you can just step over to my right, Maggie will be taking your arrival photo. Okay. Hi, Jake. Maggie? Maggie... Hi. What are you... Hi. So who's the lucky lady? The lucky lady? I... Yeah... I mean... Jennifer... My sister. You know, my sister? I th... - Yeah. - Right. Did Jennifer invite you to the wedding? No. Not... Not exactly. It looks like I'm the wedding photographer. I thought you moved home. Yeah, I did, but my... my grandma runs the reception manor on the island, so I took a job doing photos. Well, that's... that's great. I mean you've always loved that. You know, you took the photo of the Shelby Street Bridge for our album cover? The one you hated. I didn't hate it. Even though the walkway wasn't "Exactly Center"? I've... come to learn that's part of the composition's charm. - Jenn. Hi! - Hi! It is so good to see you. You too. So you're getting married, huh? Yeah, well, I figured. I like him, so why not. - Kyle. - Hi. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Maggie this is Lindsay, my favorite cousin, slash maid of honor. Hi. And this is Derek, Kyle's best man. - Like the little brother I never had. - Cut it out. It really is so good to see you. Thank you. You too. You know, I mean... I have to ask. What's with all the super-secret... I know. I know. I'm sorry. I just... I really wanted you to be at my wedding, but I was scared you wouldn't come. Jenn, you could have just called and asked. I didn't want to put that pressure on you. Yeah, this is much less pressure. Everyone, I think our ride is here, if you'll all just want to follow me. That would be great. Oh, look. Kyle, look at this. This is very cool. This is the bride and groom. Hey. Nice to meet you. Alright, let's get you on the way to the manor. It's so pretty. Mayor McCready, they're all yours. Thank you, Sasha. Al right... Welcome everyone. As Sasha said, I am Mayor McCready, but today, I'm just your humble tour guide, so sit back and relax as we take the scenic route though Piedmount Island, our little hamlet of the Pacific. Fun fact number 1: Piedmount Island actually qualifies as a hamlet. So... what was that all about? Yeah. I... guess I didn't tell you the whole Nashville story. Obviously. Jake and I were actually a singing duo. Colby & Case. What? I can't believe you never mentioned that. I didn't want the paparazzi to find out. It would be mayhem. I don't think they'd find you all the way out here. Fun fact number 4... In 1968, the island was given protected status, ensuring that it would stay pristine for years to come. Why didn't you tell me Maggie was going to be here? Why, so you could obsess about it? Obsess? No, I wouldn't have... I wouldn't have... Obsessed about it. I just would have liked a heads up. Here's a heads up. Maggie's gonna be here. What's the big deal? You guys must have been friends, right? Well, we... dated for two years. What? Well, what happened? I don't know. The pressure of being a couple and a duo was just too much. I have so many questions. And on the right we have the Mayor's Residence. Fun fact number 11: my flower garden is the second largest private collection of local blooms in the state of Washington. That's a lot of flowers. Fun fact number 16: the population of Piedmount can double or triple, depending on the size of the wedding. Thanks. I'm going to go talk to Evelyn. Did you get some good shots of the ferry? Why didn't you tell me? Maggie, I had a client who requested anonymity, and that's what I provided. She's not just a client, Nana. I have... Sorry, Evelyn. I hadn't seen him in two years. It would have been nice to know ahead of time. And what would that have changed? I could have... I don't know... I... It would have been nice, okay, to be prepared. Maggie, you don't have to be nervous about seeing Jake again. I'm not nervous. What? I'm not. Just please, no more surprises. I'll do my best. Thank you. By the way, your folks say to say hi to Jake for them. Oh, nice. Nice. So you bothered to tell them? Great. Fun fact number... 23! Thank you. Downtown Piedmount houses the most wedding-related shops per square mile of any place in the U.S. I want all the glasses filled the same amount, please. Thank you. Looking great, everyone. They're here! Now, remember, next Friday, there's an open house at the Mayor's residence, so stop on by and try one of my world-famous snickerdoodle-thumbprints'mores cookies. Those sound delicious. Come by Friday and see for yourself. Thank you, Mayor McCready. We're getting married by a Mr. McCready. Any relation? Actually, yes. That's me. So you're also a minister? Is there anything you can't do? Windows. We're getting married by the mayor. We're so fancy! Enjoy. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I could get used to this. Enjoy your drink. Mom and Dad would have loved this. They'd be so proud of you. At least I've got you. The brother of the bride. You got me, right? Absolutely. Let's all raise our glasses, everyone. To Jennifer and Kyle. To Jennifer and Kyle. Hey, I can't wait to catch up. Jenn, I'm sure Maggie has tons of stuff she has to do. Besides, you'll be so busy with wedding stuff. I know, but I want you to be a part of the events. That's why I got the deluxe package. We have a deluxe package? I created it just for Jennifer. Here's the itinerary for the week. I do love activities. We'll start as soon as you get settled. Maggie will meet you on the front lawn for a photo shoot. Yay. This is going to be so much fun. Great. Here is to reconnecting with old friends. A five-page itinerary? I thought we said no more surprises. It's double-spaced. It's not that much. It's a lot. I mean, some of this stuff I get. Cake tasting, nature walk. Sure. But... Antique shopping? Really? Just what every bride dreams about... selfies with the groom with a 19th-century Victrola. That's a great idea. If they do selfies, I can stop paying you. Fine, I'm on it. That's what I thought. Have fun. That's a lot of activities. Jake, you don't need to be here. I'm just shooting Jennifer and Kyle today. Yeah. I know. Evelyn told me to make myself useful, so. Thanks. Apparently, when there's a wedding on the island, everyone's involved. I... I realized the whole community aspect when the mayor asked me over for cookies on Friday. It's an open house, so, actually, everyone's invited. Right. No, I know he didn't personally invite me. I'm sorry all this got sprung on you. Well, what can you do? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. How about you, though? I mean, this island is pretty relaxed. I can relax. What? I can. People can change, you know? There are times I'm downright spontaneous. Allow me to give you a hand. See? I'm being spontaneous. Can you just hold this end of the bench, please? - Hold that end? - Great. Thanks. You know, I actually think it would looks good... Right. Just holding. - So is this the... - So, what have you... I was gonna ask what you've been up to. Yeah. I'm at K & J Records now. It's actually a pretty big week for me, I just finished my first album. Yeah! Yeah. It's been good to be back in the studio. Are you singing all original stuff or... No, no, I'm not singing, I'm producing. Have you heard of Ashleigh Z? Yeah, "Barefoot in the Rain" Ashleigh Z? That's the one. I'm producing her next album. Wait, are you kidding? That is huge. How did you... She heard a remix I did of "Wichita Lineman" and loved it and told the label she wanted me to produce her next album, so here I am. Congratulations. Thank you. But enough about me. How are you? How is life on the island? It's... It's good. Would you sit? I want to check the exposure. Sure. Are you still singing? Not really. Move to your left a little. You know, you should really think about singing for all the weddings that come through here. I'll keep that in mind. What a perfect spot. You guys look wonderful. I know. He cleans up nice. He sure does. Why don't you have a seat? Let's get some shots here. And then I was thinking later we could go down to the Cove. - Great. - Great. What are you... What are you doing? I'm just looking at the frame. Looks good. I would zoom in a little, though. I haven't actually set up the shot yet, Jake. Okay. Do you mind if I get in there to do my job? You're the photographer. Right. I am. Thanks. Okay. Nice big smiles. Jennifer, tell me about your first date with Kyle. Maggie, it was at Conklin's. How would I know that? Because you were there, remember? Yeah. We came to watch you and Jake play... Right... right. Conklin's. I'm so sorry I forgot, you two. Yeah, I mean, the one person that I wanted to find it memorable is marrying me, so. We're good. You know what... Okay, nice big smiles! Beautiful. What are the chances? Well, it is the only cafe on the island, so. Yeah. I see you got the cappuccino. I got that myself. I hear it's the best on the island. Also, the only on the island. It's Ashleigh. She only texts. Apparently, karmically, it's the cleanest way to communicate. Are these the pictures from yesterday? Can I see? Actually, I should head off to the hair salon to shoot Jennifer's hair-style test for the wedding. The deluxe package. Yeah. I need some caffeine. I'm fading. It's so dark and quiet here, I couldn't even fall asleep last night. Yeah, it takes a minute to get used to. I also can't help but worry about the album. What's wrong? The engineer hasn't sent the mixes and I need them like yesterday to send back my notes. - You've always been very fast at mixing notes. I know, but if this is delayed, then the mastering is late, and then the release date is off, and this is just too big for me to screw up, you know? I... And the timing of it is just... You're not kidding about the relaxed pace. I mean... this cappuccino has been, like, 15 minutes in the making. Well, you can't rush the best cappuccino on the island, can you? I guess not. - Thank you. - Enjoy it. At least try to. It is your sister's wedding after all. Okay, that photo, you can delete. You need at least one "before" photo. How's this for the "after"? That'll look beautiful on you. Jake was actually the one who picked out that hairstyle for me. Really? Isn't he so helpful these days? Okay, what is her deal? Usually, she's an open book, but I didn't even know there was a Colby & Case until yesterday. I'll tell you anything you want to know. Don't mind me. I'm just here to take pictures. Okay, so how did they start singing together? Jake used to host an open mic night at this little club in Nashville called... The Eagle's Nest Cafe. Right. She was taking pictures. And she ended up next to Jake. And she must have been humming along or something, because Jake said, "You have really good pitch. Are you a singer?" Oh, smooth. Well, she said no. You little liar. What I said was, "not tonight". I was new to the area, I'd never performed in front of that many people. So, they chatted for awhile, and then Jake got up on stage with his guitar and he announced Maggie as the next singer. So romantic. Definitely not romantic. I was mortified. And... And... I knew he wouldn't give up until I sang, so... I got on stage. She asked him what songs he knew, and he said, "All of them". Oh, confident. Or arrogant. Only if he doesn't know the songs you chose. Everybody knows "Country Roads". I love that song. Halfway through, he started singing the harmony, and then he did that thing where they both sing into the same microphone. It's a classic move. - Hi, Jake. - Hi. - I miss anything? - No. Nothing. - Hey, man, how's the island? - It's good, it's good. Hey, listen, I haven't gotten any of the mixes yet. Hi, Jake. It's Ashleigh. I'm sorry. It's my fault. I've just been giving Kevin some notes. Okay. They're on the way. Okay, great. Look, can we hang off making any changes until I get to listen to the tracks? Absolutely. Look, I got 'em. Okay. Thanks. Bye, Jake. Seriously? Teddy! Teddy Bear! Teddy Bear Jamboree? Teddy Bear Jamboree wedding? Ring, bear... Ring-bear... - Ringbearer! - Yes! Yes, that's it! Ringbearer. We're behind. All right, here we go. Focus. Let's focus. Alright, good job, ladies. Let's see what we've got here. Okay, well, this is impossible so I'm going to draw another one. No, no, no! You can't do that. - Why not? - Because those are the rules. Yeah. Since when did the Colby family allow redraws? Never. Remember? I played this once with you guys. I got the phrase "All that glitters is gold". I remember that. Yeah, and I used up the whole minute just drawing little dots all over the paper. Well, I got it, didn't I? You did. That proves our point exactly. No redraws. Okay, okay. Alright. It's fine, Jake, you got this. Ready? Okay. Go. A dress! Dress, dress, dress, dress. Dress. That's... That's a bouquet. That's a bouquet. - Bouquet. - Bridesmaid! Yes, yes, bridesmaids! "Always a bridesmaid, never the bride". You're a genius. How did you get that? That was fun. Are you coming to dinner? Of course. Yeah, no. I'm just gonna run to my room, see if the mixes downloaded. Okay. Don't work too hard. I won't. I'll see you all there. They're probably not downloaded. It's a really old system on the island. If you do need to download faster, there's an Internet cafe by the dock on the mainland. You could take the ferry there tomorrow. Tomorrow? How do you put up with this place? We don't really have the need to go back and forth all the time. I need to listen to these mixes tonight. It'll download when it downloads. How do you do it? Do what? How do you always stay so calm? Well, I don't drink double-shot cappuccinos. No. For real. Even when we were playing together, you never stressed about anything. You did enough of that for the both of us. Maggie. Look, I can tell you're concerned. It's just, there's no point in stressing over something you can't control? Try to be in the moment. I wish it was that simple. I have a lot riding on this. I need this album to be great. Yeah, I've heard that line before. You know, it's not always a bad thing to want to be the best at something. You're right. It's also not a bad thing to try to enjoy the process. I'll see you tomorrow. Sasha, let me help you with those. Thanks. The guests arrive Thursday, so I'm just getting some last-minute items for the welcome packs. And I confirmed with Julio for the salsa lesson tonight. Jake is gonna love that. He took one salsa class in college, and he fancies himself a pro. How are you feeling with all that by the way? It must be so strange seeing him again. Yeah, I feel like I've seen Jake more this week than in the two years we dated. I'm sure that feels... different. Yeah, but maybe it's in a good way. I mean, he's been super helpful to Jennifer. How about you? How are you doing? Well... I got an official offer from MVR Events. But they need to know by Monday. Well, that's great. Are you gonna take it? I don't know what to do. I want to talk to Evelyn, but I'm getting this feeling that she's not happy with my work or something. What? No... I made this really nice one-pager for who the guests should call in case of a problem. You know, so they don't bother the bride. Fantastic idea. I thought so, too, but every time I tried to talk to Evelyn about incorporating it into all of the weddings, she just said, "We'll talk about it later". Well, keep trying talk to her. Mind if I join you? Sure. This is an amazing cappuccino. I had to get another one. You seem chipper. I am. Got the mixes last night. They sound great. Congratulations. Thank you. It's exciting. And I just found out that the studio is going to send me to supervise the tour. Oh, my gosh. That's incredible. Guess where they're gonna kick it off. Alright, I'll tell you. The Olympia, in Paris. - Wait, what? - Yeah. That is an amazing venue. I can't believe you're going to get to play there. Well, I mean... I'm not... I'm not playing there, you know? I'm just... They're just sending me to supervise. Jake, you don't have to downplay it. You're her producer. That's a big deal. You have every right to be excited. I know, it's just you and I talked about. playing there with Colby & Case. I didn't want you to think that I was... No, Jake, I'm... I'm really happy for you. - Honestly. - Thanks, Mags. You've always been so supportive. It means a lot. You deserve it. You're... you're really talented. You are, too. I should... get going. You can't stay for a minute? I don't have time right now. But... I'm sure I'll see you around. Looking forward to it. Give me a twirl. Bueno, bueno. You learn very quick. Now let's do it again with passion. Okay, everybody, face your partner. I'm so sorry I'm late. I'm sorry. You missed the lesson. Well, I took a salsa class in college, so I think I can keep up. Good. We'll put you in front. - Okay. - Hey. We're short a partner. Maggie, why don't you dance with Jake? Oh, no. I need to take photos. The deluxe package, remember? I don't mind if there are no pictures of this. You know what, I can... I can just watch. No, no, no. You cannot let all that dance training go to waste? Come on! You did that on purpose. Five, six, seven, eight. In salsa, you pause on the four and the eight. - I know, Jake. - Okay. One, two, three, pause. Five, six, seven, pause. One, two, three, pause... Five, six, seven, pause. I'm just trying to help. Well, you're not. Maybe if you relax your hand a little bit? My hand is fine. First of all, you are too far away from each other. We need tension here. So my hand shouldn't be relaxed? Good. Thank you. Let's try again. Try this. Close your eyes and just listen to the music. Five, six, seven, eight. Step, step, hold... Step, step, hold. Step, step, hold. Step, step, hold. You two dance much better when you don't look at each other. Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you dance with passion. Hi, Maggie. If you're looking for Evelyn, she's already left to help with the fire cookout tonight. I was just going to run up to the office and drop off the mock-up for Tricia's brochure. Here. Let me help you with that. - Thanks. - Of course. So, I heard you and Jake were quite the hit at salsa yesterday. It was more like we moved around while we fought. He just can't help himself. It's like... It's like when we sang together. So, Jake and I got asked to be in a showcase for this record producer. And Jake kept obsessing about everything. The lyrics, the harmonies. And even though we had performed this song a million times, he kept changing things at the last minute. So, when we got up there, I just... It was not good. Needless to say, the label didn't sign us and the producer lost interest. We were just so... different with how we handled that kind of thing. You never wanted to try it on your own? After going through all that... No. It... It's just too hard. I love singing so much, I didn't want to associate it with rejection. So now it's just... a hobby. It is also tradition that we say a few kind words about the bride and groom. Growing up, Kyle was like an older brother to me. He taught me how to play basketball, how to ride a bike... He even taught me how to talk to girls. And while I'm tempted to use this moment to kind of say an embarrassing story about him, I'll just say... I'm proud of you, brother. You found a good one. Jennifer called me the night after her first date with Kyle, and she said, "I think I found the one". And when I met him, I knew she was right. So here's to a wonderful couple and a perfect night on this beautiful island. - We love you. - We love you. Thank you. You know what would be amazing? If Jake and Maggie sang something. Yeah. Oh, no. Jenn, I don't think so. Why not? Well, because, I... I don't have my guitar. You know, Evelyn told me to bring it. I actually have it. - What do you think? - I think I'd rather not. Oh, please? For old times' sake. Maybe... maybe Jake should just sing something by himself. Well, she didn't ask me. She asked us. Please? I'm so excited. Come on. Let's see here... - What are you doing? - A little out of tune. - Well, it's... it's... - I was just gonna play. No, it's my guitar. I will play. Okay. How about... "For the Road"? How about... "Feel the Earth"? Great. I don't know any of those songs. That's because we wrote them. They write their own songs? I have an idea. I know we chose the song "Everything" for our first dance, but Jake and Maggie have this beautiful song called "I Belong in Your Arms". What if they did that instead? What do you think? I love it. Jenn, no. Please? Who's gonna take pictures of your first dance if I'm singing? I can do it. Jake, I don't think this is a good idea. It's just one song. Yeah, but we don't have a very good track record with "just one song". You're right. You're absolutely right about everything. Thank you. Except... it's my sister's wedding. And I know that if we sang, that... she'd be really happy. But, you know, no pressure, obviously. Okay. Thank you, of course. Hey... thank you. No changing anything. No changes. Promise. Good morning, Nana. No one's around. Good morning. You and Jake sounded great last night. Yeah, it was actually kind of fun. Time for a reunion tour? No. This is just a one-time thing. It's not what I do anymore. Maybe not... but maybe it should be. Maggie, you've always been such a great singer. And that song... That is a great song. I haven't forgotten what a talented songwriter you are. Thanks. But... it's time to move on, Nana. I'm not sure this is something you can move on from. Just think about it. That went well. Yeah, it's amazing how fun it can be when it's for the love of it and not for the labels or producers. No offense. I think it's great that you're working with Ashleigh. You know, I was listening to the final mixes this morning and I realized whose voice Ashleigh reminds me of... yours. In case you wanna listen... Remind me again why don't you sing anymore? Well, I keep pretty busy with photography. Okay, what about you? Well, I tried the whole solo thing, but I never sounded as good alone as we did together. Ashleigh likes to send these texts that go on and on and on. I just gotta scan it and make sure everything's okay. Of course. The release is canceled. For the album? Yeah. We lost the rights to one of the songs. Wait, I thought Ashleigh wrote all her own stuff. Okay, Jake, I'm sure you'll find another song. No, no, no. This song was like the concept the album was built on. I can't just throw another song in there. I should have seen this coming. Jake, there's no way you could have known. No, I knew something was up when the songwriter listened to what I did, and now, all of a sudden, he wants to record it himself. I... I don't know. Jake, I'm so sorry. I know how hard you've worked for this. I gotta go. I gotta see if I can get ahold of her. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, okay. Alright, ladies. Cheers! Perfect. So beautiful. Wedding pedicures, champagne... not a bad way to start the day. Only two more days. Are you ready? I can't believe the wedding's almost here. It goes so fast. It really does. I really wouldn't have been able to do any of this without Jake. He's been so great. Yeah. He really has been watching out for you. Especially with everything he's had going on. I just don't get it. I mean, there's got to be a million songwriters out there who could write something. Apparently, she doesn't trust a lot of people. He had to meet with her about 12 times before she hired him. Looking good, ladies. So we have a lot to get done downtown, so whenever you're finished your drinks, the trolley is ready for ya. Here's to smelling flowers and tasting cake! Are all of those roses for my wedding? All of them. How do I look? This pistachio is so good. Hey, Evelyn sent me over with the all-important cake topper. It's so beautiful. I should be on payroll with all the stuff she's got me doing. We can only afford to pay you in cake. Deal! Not that one, it's pistachio. So? You hate pistachio. I used to hate pistachio. So you just suddenly like it now? Yeah. I've matured a lot over the last couple of years. Yes. Very mature. So mature. I just need you both to sign here and then we'll get this notarized. This is adorable. They should pass a law that all city clerk offices should be in gazebos. You're in a good mood. Did you get the rights to your song back? I called the writer to tell him how important the song was for the album, but he made up his mind, he's going to record it himself. Then why are you so happy? I took advice from someone I really respect. Is that so? I didn't want to fight it. I tried my best, but, it's like you always say, some things are just out of my control. But I can control how much I enjoy this time with my sister and make sure this is special for her. That's what's important. Look how happy they are. Now, that's worth fighting for. - Is that everyone? - Yep. Our population just doubled. Well, thank you, Mayor. Let's get a shot of you all. No. Maggie, come on. I want you to be in a picture, too. Come on. Okay, sure. Hi, Maggie. Ooh, rough night's sleep? I'm going to talk to Evelyn about my job offer today, so I got her her favorite coffee. Smart. Sasha, you're amazing at what you do. Just tell her what you want. She knows how valuable you are. Thanks, Maggie. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. Good morning, Evelyn. Morning. Can I talk to you for a moment? Thank you. So, I've been working for you for about three years now... ...and I... I love it. I need to take this. Hello, Tricia. We have a problem. I need you to get Jennifer and Kyle and walk them through the ceremony. I'll talk to you later. Okay. How bad is it? Perfect. Now Jake and Jennifer. Wait, so is this the archway? 'Cause it just looks like branches. No, no, no. It'll be covered in flowers tomorrow. That's a lot of flowers. I just want it to be perfect, you know? Trust me. You'll love it. My little sister is all grown up. - I want to see these. - Yeah. Come look. Excuse me, everyone. I'm sorry. Why doesn't everyone head back to the manor? I need to speak with Jennifer and Kyle. Nana, what's wrong? Tricia's refrigerator broke down last night and we have lost a lot of flowers. The bouquets for the bride and the bridesmaids are fine. Okay... But the other flowers... I'm so sorry. It's going to be alright. - I'm sorry. - Jenn. Jenn. There's gotta be another solution. I mean, well, look, we're surrounded by flowers. Why can't we just pick these? But there are so many weddings happening here this summer, we can't just ruin the gardens. What about the ferry? We could take it back to the mainland, hit every flower shop, and just buy them out. It's Friday, the ferry already ran, it's back at the dock on the mainland. Wait, it's Friday? Yeah? It's Friday. - It's Friday. - Come on. And only Mrs. McCready and I know the recipe. They're amazing. I started making those when I first ran for mayor 25 years ago, and I've run unopposed ever since. - Your Honor... - Your Honor? When someone calls me Your Honor, it usually means they need a favor. Or they want the cookie recipe. No, I can't imagine you would divulge such a closely-held government secret, so... What's the favor? - Well... - Well... I can't believe that worked! Are you kidding, he couldn't resist the Colby charm. I think it was the Case charisma. You know, I think it's really great how much you're doing for Jennifer. Well, when something's important, you make the effort. I just want to make it special. I can't wait to see her face when she see's all this. Hey, thanks for all your help. And I'm glad you weren't too upset when she surprised you like that... surprised both of us. I was at first... But not anymore. If you'd known beforehand, you think you still would have taken the job? I don't know. I'm glad I did. Yeah, me too. You know, it's nice to know that after everything that's happened, we can still be friends, right? We've got flowers! Amazing! You two make quite the duo. I'm gonna go tell Jenn the good news. Okay. I still can't believe you got flowers from the mayor's garden. Well, I can't take all the credit for that. Maggie agreed to do a photo session with the Mayor. I'm pretty sure that's what clinched it. It's been nice seeing her again. It has. Yeah. I have to say, when the two of you were singing, it's like you never stopped. It was nice. Maybe this could be the start of something. Don't you mean the re-start of something? Well, now that you're not leaving on a nine-month tour to Europe... I don't know. Maggie seems pretty happy here. You're right, she does. Especially the last day or two. Okay. The question is, how has the last day or two been for you, huh? Are you ready? Huh? - I couldn't be happier. - Good. I just want you to be happy, too. No, my work is gonna be fine. Don't worry about me. I'm not talking about work. I'm talking about Maggie. I know you regret the way the two of you ended things. Maybe this is your chance to reconnect. I don't think she thinks of me that way anymore. Well, do you still think of her in that way? You get me, don't you? You get me. - Hi. - Hi. Nice recording set-up. Thanks. And thanks for coming down. Sure. What's up? Okay, you're starting to freak me out now. No. I was just thinking about Ashleigh's album. Jennifer said she doesn't trust a lot of people, so what if the song came from you? Well, I can't write a song that fast. What if it was already written? I was looking at that song we wrote, "Footsteps". It's a great song, Mags. I don't think it works for the album, though. No, I know. I changed the key and rewrote the lyrics. Now it's called "Worth Fighting For". I can't believe you did all this. Well, I know how excited you were about the album. When you heard the mix, you said everything was great, so... I wanted to help. These lyrics are great. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah. I mean... I mean... I mean, I've got to check in with Ashleigh, but, I mean, there's a real chance that she's gonna love this. I also recorded it. I thought maybe you needed a demo. It's all on there if you want to send it to Ashleigh. Or not. Whatever you... - Whatever you want. - Are you kidding? I mean, the least we can do is try, right? I mean, honestly, no pressure. I... I had a lot of fun doing it. It was... really nice making music again. Thank you. I should get going. I have to set up for the rehearsal dinner. Yeah, no. I'll let you go. I'm going to listen to this and I'm going to send it straight to Ashleigh. Mags, really... Thank you. You're welcome. This place continues to surprise me. Jenn, look at these pictures. This deluxe package is no joke. Well, it's not actually part of the "package". It's just something I thought Jennifer would really enjoy. How did you find the time to do all this? Well, when something's important, you make the effort. I want to make sure it's special. Well, it's definitely special. Shall I get things started? No, I've got this. Welcome, everyone, to Jennifer and Kyle's last night before they journey into wedded bliss. Every couple who gets married here signs their name on a shell the night before they wed. So, Jennifer and Kyle, please come and sign your shell. Now let's all move inside and get this party started. Okay... Next question. Who can name the five starting players from the 1997 World Champion Chicago Bulls? - Really? - You wanna bet against me? They seem to think Kyle. Jennifer and Kyle, who is it? Prove it. Pippin, Rodman, Longly, Harper, Jordan. - What tiiiiime is it? - Game time. Okay, next question. Who can perform, by heart, the entire NSYNC video, "Bye Bye Bye"? Okay... Who is it? Sasha, why aren't you up there asking the question? Evelyn's got it covered. Sasha... I'm just... I'm gonna take the job on the mainland. It's fine. It's fine. The job is great. It's just that... Evelyn's never going to trust me to take over the business. I think you may be misreading this. I think my Nana is struggling more with the idea of retiring than with trusting you. I'm not saying she's in denial, but she does make her only granddaughter call her Evelyn. Really... Really try to talk to her. Okay. Alright, final question. Who takes longer to get ready for a night out? Get a good night's sleep tonight. Good night. Thank you. Big day tomorrow. - Hey. - Hey. You feel like talking a walk? Yeah. I would love that. Look at this place. This little lake was my secret hideaway when my family used to vacation here as a kid. So amazing. Come on. I used to spend hours out here. Actually... it's where I wrote my first song. Really? You never told me that. Something about floating just made me want to write. It is still... and peaceful. You nervous about tomorrow? No. I'm not the one getting married. No. I mean about singing. Yeah, I thought I would be, but I'm... I'm not, really. Yeah. I'm looking forward to it. Me too. I... I know there were times I could be pretty unbearable when we were singing together. I'm sorry about that. It wasn't just you. I'm sorry I left the way I did. I was... I was just scared. Well, that's in the past. We're different people now. I know I've grown up a lot since then. So have I. Yeah. I can tell. I'm so sorry! I got you straight in the eye. My oar. Maggie! Maggie! I'm good, I'm good. Oh, no... Hurry and change and meet me back at the manor. I can fix it. Cell phone pilaf, my favorite. A Piedmount Island classic. Here, give me your phone. This doesn't really work, though, does it? - It hasn't failed me yet. - Amazing. Hey, thanks for showing me your secret hideaway. My pleasure. Even though I did dunk us in freezing-cold water. Right. Sorry about that. It's been really nice seeing you again. You too. Maybe we could... see more of each other? I'd like that. If... Ashleigh likes the song and the tour happens, how long will you be gone? About a year. But, I mean, we don't know what will happen. We could just take it one day at a time. You... you should go to sleep. You have a bride to give away tomorrow. I do. Here. I'll see you tomorrow. - I will see you tomorrow. - Okay. You got the rings? Right here. You're ready. Ready? Nice and slow. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Thank you, girls. So beautiful. See? Like it? It could be a little better. I'm kidding. No, you're doing great. How do you feel? Like I'm floating. It was such a beautiful ceremony. Now it's time to start the party. No, first, we need some posed photos. What's wrong? This memory card's acting up. - What? - No... The pictures I already took are fine. It's just this card... Okay. I'm gonna head back to my office, copy off the photos. I'll be 15 minutes, tops. While she's doing that, I've got a little something for you in my room, so I will be right back. - We'll be right here. - Okay. I'm just going to go up and see if everyone's okay. Jenny-Jenn. Congratulations. Jake, you've already done so much already. What is it? I just got a call from Ashleigh and she loved the song. - What? - That's amazing. I know, I know. It's... The only thing is... in order to stay on schedule, they'd need to record it first thing tomorrow morning, so she asked me to fly a red eye back tonight. Then you have to go. What? No. No. I can't leave your wedding. The ceremony was the wedding, which you were here for, and you gave me away. The whole week was perfect. You've worked so hard for this. I know, I know, but... You should go. - Are you sure? - Yes. But, look, I don't even know if there's a ferry today. Well, you're in luck, because the next one leaves in about seven minutes. What? No. We don't have to... I'll just get the next ferry... whenever that is. There is no next one. What is with the ferry on this island? Stop asking questions and go. Jake you're not just producing anymore, there's a Colby & Case song on this album now. I know, exactly, so I need to stay and tell Maggie the good news. - There's no time. - I will tell her. Just go. Okay, okay, okay, all right. Okay, all right. Okay. Thank you. We're gonna make it. You think Maggie's going to be upset? She'll understand. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You're going to make it! Wait! Wait! Wait! I have a... Here, I have a ticket. All right. Let's get some pictures of the newlyweds! Maggie... Ashleigh loved your song. She did? Yeah, she wants to use it for the album. That's amazing! Where's Jake? In order to stay on schedule, they have to record first thing tomorrow, so he had to go tonight. Wait. What? He really wanted to wait to tell you himself, but the ferry was leaving, and everything got so hectic... This is so exciting. The world's finally gonna hear a Colby & Case song. Which means that he'll be going on tour. Right. Okay... I'm so sorry, Maggie. No. No, you know... you know what, that's great news. It is. It's so great. Our song is gonna be on a hit album and the two of you just got married, so let's celebrate that and take some pictures. Why don't you guys go grab the rest of the wedding party and I'll head down to the pond and set up? Are you okay? Fine. All right, so you guys are all done. You can head up and enjoy the reception. Your main job as the maid of honor at the reception... to make sure the bride eats. And to catch the bouquet. - Thanks, Maggie. - You bet. Come on. Let's get up there. Beautiful. Over there, please. Thank you. Sasha, once the photos are finished, - I'll introduce the newlyweds. - I can do it. That's okay. I've got it. Evelyn. I would like to do the introduction. You are amazing at what you do, but someday, you're going to have to hand off the reins to someone else. And I'd like that someone to be me. Is that so? I've been watching and learning from you for three years now, and I know I can do it and I know I can make you proud. And the truth is, I've been offered another opportunity. But I love this island, and I was really hoping that you'd give me a reason to turn them down. Another job offer, huh? Yes, ma'am. Well... in that case... Really? We'll start by making you my partner. I am not going to retire. - Of course. - I'm not. Understood. Now, get up there. I hear Jake had to go back. Yeah. Duty called. Now, I know you are a grown woman, capable of making your own decisions, but you'll always be my little Magpie, and it's my job to look out for you. Thanks, Nana. And... I think you've been here long enough. What are you talking about? When you came here, you were hurting. And I gave you this job to help you heal. Don't get me wrong, you are a wonderful photographer. But... your music... I saw it at the fire pit. It's what you were born to do. If you don't trust me... trust the fact that you wrote a song, in a day, and Ashleigh Z loved it enough to make it the centerpiece of her new album. You have to share your talent with the world. Well, I'm not just gonna leave you in a bind like this, Nana. You're not. I have a new partner, so I can go back to what I was born to do... photography. Nana, are you firing me? I'm pushing you out of the nest. It's your time to fly. Thank you. Now, give your Nana the camera. Okay. - You have a song to sing. - Okay. Thank you so much. Good afternoon, everyone. If you could please welcome, for the first time ever, as husband and wife... Kyle and Jennifer Robertson. And here to sing their first dance is Maggie Case. Kyle and Jennifer have chosen something very special for their first dance. It's a song written by me and her brother, Jake. Jennifer and Kyle, we love you. We now invite everyone to dance with the newlyweds. Jake, what are you doing here? Well, it's a duet, right? Well, yeah, but... You made me promise no changes. That's right. I did make you promise. See, I do listen. Let's hear it for the bride and groom. I can't believe you made it back. Mags, the minute the ferry pulled away, I knew I was making a huge mistake. I realized that producing isn't what makes me happy. What makes me happy is singing with you. Me too, Jake. I had no idea how much until they told me you left. But what about the song, the tour? The Olympia in Paris? She still wants me to do the Olympia. With you. What? She wants Colby & Case to open for her. What did you say? I said I needed to check with someone. So, what do you say? You want to get the band back together? I think we're due for a reunion tour.
