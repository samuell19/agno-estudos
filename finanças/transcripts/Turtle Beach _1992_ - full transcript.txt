[chattering in native language] -[explosion] -[man shouts] [shouting] [glass breaking] [shouting] [men chanting in native language] [shouting] [chanting in native language] -[horn honking] -RICHARD [shouting]: Judith! Judith! [horn honks] [screaming] -[gasps] Shit! -RICHARD: Come on! [speaking native language] [men shouting] -RICHARD: Get down! -[Judith grunts] [tires squealing] [chanting in native language] [groans] -[tires squealing] -[shouting] [tires squealing] -[gunshots] -[shouting] God knows they've got nothing to fear from the Indians. And they'll never get the Chinese out. They're too good at business. JUDITH: Mmm. Hmm. Jesus. [exhales] [siren blaring in distance] Are you okay? Yeah. [moans] [synthesizer music plays] [chattering] -JUDITH: Got everything? -Yep. Hurry up. Come on. [sighs] Bye, darling. -Good-bye, Mummy. -Mmm. Will we see you next weekend? You're going to your dad's, remember? But we'll be with you for the holidays, won't we? Got your hanky? DAVID: Yes. [children singing in background] Thanks, Mum. -Here's yours. -DAVID: Thanks, Mum. Off you go now. Bye, Mum. -Bye. -DAVID: Bye. MAN: Come on, boys. You'll be late. Right. BILL: Well, there are no riots there this time, as yet, but there soon could be with the refugee problem. Talk to this woman. Her name is Minou, the second Lady Hobday. Recently married to Sir Adrian Hobday, -our ambassador to Malaysia. -Ah, yes. She's president of the International Refugee Relief Committee, and if anybody can get you onto Bidong Island, it's her. BILL: You'll find her at the Regent. She's here in Sydney for a conference. [knocks] WOMAN: Leave it by the door, please. [knocks] Oh. Did you get my message? The interview? Well, can I come in? Sure. [door closes] Make yourself at home. JUDITH: Million-dollar view. MINOU: If you like water everywhere. You went from Bangkok to Malaysia. Why did you leave Saigon? What do you think they do to women who were friendly with the enemy? I wasn't that keen on a bullet through the back of my head. Do you want to talk about the refugees or not? Sure. Why is it that journalists aren't allowed in the Bidong camp? What's the Malaysian government hiding? MINOU: Well, the official line is they don't want the Vietnamese to know they're accepting refugees. But the truth is, they don't want the world to know that they're treating the Vietnamese like dogs. Other refugees, they'll look after. The Chinese and Vietnamese, they've always hated us. They want us dead. Well, is there any way out for them? Bribery? There's bound to be a black market. There is corruption at all levels. No matter who you're dealing with, no one helps anyone unless they get something out of it. [chattering] You're still obsessed with Malaysia, aren't you? -This is really important. -So is my holiday. I can't cancel. I've got to get out and meet some new people. I'm going crazy. -Richard, you've got a new woman every month. I've had no one. -Come on. Why-- Well, it's your own fault. You're a workaholic. Look, I can't replace a husband that easy. It's a pity you don't feel the same about your kids. Mmm. I'd forgotten how good you are at the guilt trips. Look, let's not get into this again. I'll take the kids this time. Thanks. I'll make it up to you. [woman on P.A. speaking native language] [horns honking] [chattering in native language] SANCHA: Does it look any different? The city's grown. SANCHA: Well, a lot can happen in 10 years. [horn honking] Oh, come on. They should ban those bikes. I'll be glad when Ralph gets his next posting. He spends half the time with his precious refugees. -On Bidong? -Mm-hmm. Must be awful there. Well, Ralph says it's stage four of the Vietnam War. [crickets chirping] JUDITH: What a beautiful house. SANCHA: It used to be the center of a huge rubber plantation. We've kept it original inside. How the other half lives. [chuckles] WOMAN: Welcome home, Ms. Sancha. Got to have the best. Come on. I'll show you your room. You must be exhausted. JUDITH: Good of you to let me stay, Sancha. [sighs] [birds squawking] -[horns honking] -[man chanting on P.A.] [chattering and horns honking] [laughing] JUDITH: Julian. My God. Judith. -Hey. -How are you? It's been years. What brings you back to this sweatbox? -I came for the boat people story. -Haven't we all, darling? Oh, the place is crawling with us. All the old gang are here. Have you seen Jack? -No. I only just got here. -Then you won't have heard about "the disappearance." No. What's up? The president of the International Refugee Relief Committee is missing. Minou Hobday. Rumors are it's a kidnap. [sobs] Sir Adrian. Sir Adrian, do you think the kidnap will have any bearing on Australia's foreign policy toward the boat people? We have no evidence to suggest there's been a kidnap. Do you believe there's any other reason for your wife's disappearance? As soon as information comes to hand from Special Branch, we'll let you know. Do you-- Do you think you've compromised the embassy's standing -by marrying a Vietnamese refugee? -[sighs] -[groaning] -[murmuring] That's all for now. [reporters shouting questions] MAN: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That's all. [chattering] [bells dinging] [music playing and man singing in native language over P.A.] ADRIAN: Where's my wife, Kanan? KANAN: She's safe. She's where she always goes. ADRIAN: I've told you, she mustn't go there. Minou is not a prisoner. I won't give her false hopes. KANAN: Then she's lucky she's got me to help. If I thought there was any hope at all, I'd be doing everything possible. You couldn't. I'm saving you from diplomatic suicide, Hobday. -I forbid any more trips to Turtle Beach. -What if she's right? Terrified of that, aren't you? Just keep out of it. -[laughing] -[laughing] White boys got thrashed in Delhi again, eh? [chuckles] Indian umpires, mate. RALPH: There's a friend of Sancha's staying with us. Ah, there she is. Come and join us. SANCHA: This is my old school friend, Judith Wilkes. Kanan Subramaniam. Pleased to meet you. Hi. Here for a bit of sightseeing? It's an interesting city. Judy's a reporter. She's here for the boat people. Ah, a reporter. Popular occupation in K.L. these days. [all chuckle] Would you like a drink? -SANCHA: We have champagne open. -Love one. SANCHA: And I'll have another one too, darling. -SANCHA: Great. -Gotcha. [chuckles] Sancha's so competitive. -She always was. -Look who's talking. [chuckles] -Ohh! -Ooh. -[all chuckle] -Never gets me anywhere. -Any news on Minou? -Oh, she's been found. She was at Turtle Beach all along. -Isn't that where the refugee boats come in? -Mm-hmm. -What was she doing there? -She was looking for turtles. -She was waiting-- -Shut up, Kanan. Oh, is that what you do at Bidong as well, Ralph? Look for turtles? [balls clack] -You bugger. -So sorry, old man. [balls clack] -Drinks all around? -In a moment. Judith. I thought turtle season was in May. -December. -Oh. Turtle Beach is the last breeding ground in the world for the green turtle. So why were you spying on me? I wasn't spying on you. I was keeping tabs on Sir Adrian. Of course. For your story. [Judith chuckles] JUDITH: So how do you know so much about Minou? KANAN: I'm her friend. [crickets chirping] Sir Adrian Hobday is an upper-class bore. Minou only married him for his embassy post. And what a mistake she made. He won't do a thing for her. Kanan sees it as his role in life to take Hobday down a peg or two. Only out of friendship for you, Ralph. Oh, is that all? [chuckles] So how is Bidong? Why don't you take Judith with you next time you go? You know the rules. No press. I don't intend breaking them. How do you decide which refugees to take? We take the strong ones. The ones who've proven that they can handle this mess. They're women, mostly. I don't know why, but they're tougher. We've had years of practice at surviving. The boat people are the bravest people in the world. You know, the, uh, Vietnamese are known as the "Jews of Asia". Is that why they hide the camps? KANAN: What an appetite you have, Judith. I mean for the truth. [liquid pouring] ADRIAN: I'm in the middle of delicate negotiations. Embarrassment like this leaves me under pressure from the Malaysian government to convince my minister to take more boat people than we're prepared to accept. I'm the only voice of reason in this whole damned affair. If Ralph had his way, there'd be more Vietnamese in Australia than we can cope with. I've had to make personal apologies to half the diplomatic world. There's been hell's own delight with the press. You know I didn't mean to hurt you. I can't afford things like this. Your obsession has got to end. I'm so sorry. I couldn't tell you. You would have stopped me. [sniffles] You always protect me, Papa. And I'm such a bad girl. Always getting you into trouble. Promise to ask me next time, not Kanan. I promise. Good. [sighs] Baby wants to fuck you, Papa. We'll make the bad world go far away. [Adrian sighs] Would you like that, Papa? Yes, I would. [Adrian sighs] Only for you, Papa. Only for you. [kisses] Yes? Is Lady Hobday in? I'm a friend of hers from-- Lady Hobday is not in. [door closes] [sighs] MINOU: So you're a friend, Judith Wilkes. Where did you get that from? [sighs, chuckles] I make friends easily. Not with me. Well, I'm glad to see you're okay. For reasons which defy logic, I was worried about you. And pigs can fly, Judith. Look, you want to help the refugees, right? I can guarantee a front-page story. Just get me on to Bidong. Why should I trust you? Why aren't you like all the other buzzards? Because no one helps anyone unless they're getting something out of it, as you said yourself. Aha. A friend in need. [mutters] -Wait for me here. -Yes, ma'am. [men shouting] [shouting continues] [camera shutter clicks] -[man groans] -Geez-- [shutter clicking] [man shouting] [shutter clicking] Lady! Lady, no! Go home! Go! Now! [phone rings] JUDITH: Hello. Hello, Bill Whaley, please. It's Judith Wilkes calling from Malaysia. Hello, Bill. Yeah. No, no, I'm all right. I just didn't want to wire this. It's too risky. JUDITH [over phone]: Malaysia, Thursday. Today I made an unofficial visit to Bidong Island, where I witnessed an act of supreme brutality outside the Vietnamese refugee camp. I saw three shaven-headed and chained refugees being beaten by Malaysian soldiers. The question is: Why are these people being treated like prisoners of war? SANCHA: I'm really looking forward to the party tonight. I haven't been out in ages. Have you got something to wear tonight? They're awfully formal. Look, don't worry. You can borrow something of mine. -[sighing] Oh, thanks. -Judith. Hello, darling. Did you win? I thought you understood the rules. I've just had a call from Special Branch, and they told me you'd been to the Bidong camp. Well, not inside. There's a taped conversation between you and your editor. [sighs] I didn't know the phones were bugged. The refugees you saw were in the black market. They're rounding the bastards up and shaving their heads to humiliate them. Just be sure. If you act without authority again, I'll ask them to revoke your visa. What have you got against me going into the camp? You say you care about the boat people. A front-page story could help them. If we antagonize the Malays, they'll take it out on the refugees. -But if-- -They're already towing the new arrivals out to sea and leaving them to rot! We are playing their game for now. [fireworks whistling, exploding] [explosions continue] [traditional music] -Tunku Jamie. -Tunku Jamie. Bernice. I'd like you to meet a friend of ours from Australia, Judith Wilkes. Delighted. Delighted. -Hi. -Your Highness. Evening. When the revolution comes, it will be against the royal families. -MAN: Adrian. -Hello, Jim. KANAN: Watch this. Tunku Jamie. KANAN: They hate her even more than they hate me. So why do they invite you? Hobday has power, and I have money. Excuse me. Judith. -Sir Adrian wants to meet you. -Oh. ADRIAN: My wife's a great fan of yours. -She's been keeping all your articles. -Really? That's high praise. She's generally very critical. Whilst you're in Malaysia, you might like to join us for dinner one night. Mmm. [rock and roll music playing] ♪ Rock, rock, rock, everybody ♪ Roll, roll, roll, everybody ♪ Rock, rock, rock, everybody ♪ Roll, roll, roll, everybody ♪ Rock, rock, rock, everybody ♪ Rock to this groovy beat... Adrian, darling, I want to take Judith with me to Thaipusam. -Would you like that, Judith? -What's Thaipusam? I don't think Judith would really want to go there. Oh, don't be a spoilsport. My minder will be with us. We won't get up to anything with him there. -All right with you, Terry? -No problem. Minou's keen on these savage customs. Can't say I have the stomach for it myself. -Going to come, Brenda Starr? -[chuckles] -[drums beating] -[horn honks] [honking] [drumming continues] [horn honks] I think we'll get out just up here. We could go for it. You'll wait till we park the car. You're not to get out of my sight. That's an order. Adrian always gives me the butch ones. [traditional music] [whistle blows] Where is Minou? Oh, she'll find us. Opiate of the masses. This is the big Hindu event of the year. In India, it celebrates the winter equinox. -Banned there these days. -Oh, why is that? Wait and see. [music continues] [chanting] [woman singing in native language over P.A.] The day of reckoning. Of purification. Lot of nonsense, really. Wait here. That's my duty done. Come on. [drumming] [chanting] [gasps] [chanting] [no audible dialogue] [sighs] [sighs] It-- It's child mutilation. Her parents don't mean her any harm. Hindus don't harm any living thing. [sighs] I want to show you something. If they weren't so crushed by life, they'd be more moderate in their enjoyment. Don't be frightened. It's just the poor having fun. [singing in native language] Relax. We're only seeking ecstasy. [singing continues] [singing continues] Gee. [singing continues] Come on, Judith! We're out of here! Run! Minou! What are you doing? [Judith panting and gasping] [horn honks] [chuckles] It'll take him hours to get back. -MINOU: Now tell me, Judith... -[engine stops] you can swim, can't you? Yes. What exactly are we doing here? Meeting people from home. Family? Anyone from home is family. The currents are strong... the boat people weak from starvation. Some of them will drown without our help. -[sighs] -Oh, I have spare clothes in the trunk. I had it planned. [sighs] MINOU: It's the only beach in the world where the green turtles come to lay their eggs. Yeah. I remember years ago seeing one who was in labor all night. There were tears in her eyes from the strain. Uh. Turtles are terrible mothers. The babies get killed by birds before they even reach the water. And some of them never make it out of the eggs. Do the Malay villagers still rob them? Disgusting people, they are. They're coming in. [shouting in native language] [ship's horn blowing] -They've seen us! -[horn blowing continues] [shouting continues] Hey! Whoo! [shouts] Oh, quick! They'll scuttle the boat. Go! Go swimming! I can't swim! Go! [Minou shouting] [panting] [grunting] [chattering] MINOU: Judith, here. I'll take her. Get the others. [speaking native language] [panting] [shouting in native language] [grunting] [groaning] [man shouting in native language] [men chattering in native language] [child screaming] Judith! [shouting] MINOU: Judith! [shouting continues] What-- Judith. [shouting continues] [screams] No! JUDITH: What are you doing? No! No! [screaming] [gasps] [wailing] -[men shouting] -[gunshots] -[gunshots continue] -[gasps] Oh! [Judith sobbing] JUDITH [sobbing]: No. [sobbing] Look! Lady Hobday, you have a friend this time. You will both, please, come with us to the station. All right. [groaning] Had a nightmare. [Judith sobbing] At least you can wake up from it. Some people aren't so lucky. People get killed, you know, Judith. It's not a game for us. Write what you saw yesterday. I'll get it out of the country for you. [sighs] KANAN: Rise and shine, ladies. Can't stay here all day. Sorry I didn't bring you breakfast in bed. [chuckles] Hobday sent your driver for you. But why don't you come with us? [chuckles] Thanks. [sighs] Don't go to that beach again. I don't think your luck will hold out. KANAN: The Malaysians feel victimized and so are justified in victimizing others. It's an endless wheel. I don't think the Malay government means to ignore the boat people, but their plight pollutes us all. Malays don't want to become a minority in their own country. [sighs] [sobs] KANAN: Feeling better? Much better. Looks better on you than it does on me. -Mmm. Nice place you got here. -Hmm. Nice view. Keeps the wolf from the door. I had to earn every penny that went into it. My father died in the 1969 riots. JUDITH: Thank you. SANCHA: Hi. Look, Richard phoned three times. -Uh-huh. I didn't like to tell him you wound up in prison. Judith, I really think you should call him. One of your boys is sick. Chicken pox? I thought you both had that last year. Can't you come home? Oh, Dave. Your father's there. -It's not the same. -RICHARD: Here. Is that your mother? Where the hell have you been? Richard, a big story has just broken. -The Malaysian murders-- -Yeah, hold on. Hold on. -RICHARD: Say good night. -But I want to talk to her some more. Go to bed. Night, Mum. Will you phone tomorrow? Yes. I promise. You take care of your brother. Jude, you're not the only journalist filing from K.L. Nobody else saw it, Richard. I have to follow it up. Judith, I'm warning you. Come home, or you'll be sorry. You're there, Richard. Children don't die of chicken pox. A father wouldn't come home for that. Please, just once, understand. Yeah, I understand. I'll tell him you're too busy with the Vietnamese. [beeping] [exhales] Shit. [sighs] [phone rings] Hello. RICHARD: Judith, you're not behaving like a responsible mother. I want full custody of the children. I'll see you in court. That's if you've got the time to come. [line disconnects, beeping] [crickets chirping] [footsteps approaching] [sighs] Ralph. What is it? About Bidong... You could take me as an immigration assistant, nobody would-- Drop the story, Judith. You won't get into Bidong. What are you hiding? [sighs] I'm just doing my job. [sighs] Go home to your kids. [chattering] [horn honking] Thanks. Judith. Sancha told me you'd be here. I've been trying to call you. Have you seen this? You bloody press, all as bad as each other. -I'm not in the mood. -Oh, listen. -[mouths words] -MINOU: Not a word about the refugees being killed. Just "Sexy Saigon embarrasses Australian government. Looks like someone's been caught with his pants down. But after all, he's getting it for free these days from his former whore." My husband's been behaving like a real bastard. Well... We can both use a drink then. [chuckles] [chuckles] [rock music playing, woman singing] MINOU: I'll be back. [no audible dialogue] My treat. I hope I got the sex right. Come on, Judith. [music continues, muffled] -WOMAN: Hi, Minou. -Hi. MINOU: This is just like my old house. Come. I'll show you the rooms. Come on. -WOMAN: Hi. -Hi. MINOU: Give me the key. Ta-da. Body massage. Look. This is a favorite hobby of the locals. They climb up and peer in. You can tell the men who've been here before. They plug the holes before they start. How does it feel, Brenda Starr? A bit lower than your way of whoring. [exhales] -[Judith sobs] -What's wrong? Richard wants custody of my boys. Oh. The mother always gets custody, la. Just keep sobbing for the judge. [Judith groans] It's not that easy, Minou. I know. I had three children once. I left them behind. I'm sorry. Don't know where they are. I can't just pick up the phone and call them. Kwok-Kwan was conceived in a room much like this one. [sighs] They said I could only take one... and Kwok-Kwan was a baby. So, Mama tried to pass him up to me... but the chopper just took off. I-- I couldn't reach him. [sighs] Well, Vietnam is only three days away from here by boat. I think it'll take me a lifetime to find them, you know? [flute] Everyone said I was mad when I married Minou. Not a chance of being secretary after that. Twenty years' work down the drain. [chuckles] [chuckles] It was the most sober act of my life. -Papa? -Mm-hmm? I want to take Judith with me to Bidong. ADRIAN: You know journalists aren't allowed. Minou, another scandal with the pair of you, I'll be recalled. It's absolutely out of the question. -I'm sorry. -MINOU: Papa, please. My children are coming. I have to prepare. Who told you that? Kanan? He's the only man around who's helping me. You're not going to Bidong. The I Chingis favorable. -They are coming. -Your children are dead. No, they're not dead. You just want me all to yourself, -to be a little baby. -You don't think it eats away at me too? To see so much human suffering and to be absolutely powerless to do anything about it. MINOU: There are things you can do. You can help me! That's what I'm trying to do. They're dead. Forget about them. -[door slams] -[sighs] I'm sorry. I better be going. Uh, no. Stay the night. Please. [birds calling] [both speaking foreign language] Good morning. -Sleep well? -Mm-hmm. -And you? -Always, la. Don't be gloomy. You're going to Bidong. -Has Adrian changed his mind? -No. But I have a feeling that Ralph might be persuaded to change his. RALPH: Oh, Judith. I was just going to come looking for you. -You want a drink? -JUDITH: Thanks. I'm afraid the government's canceled your visa. They're still very upset about that beach riot. You've got three days. There's a seat on a direct flight tomorrow night. I had my secretary check. I must say... that the only reason I've tolerated you is for Sancha's sake. You're a guest in my house, and you have consistently abused that hospitality. I never picked you as someone who'd have two women, Ralph. What are you talking about? Lan. That's your girlfriend's name, isn't it? What's Kanan said? Nothing. But I really think you should take me with you to Bidong. RALPH: This will probably be my last trip here. I'm going to miss it, in a strange way. The islands off the coast here were untouched before the refugees. RALPH: They were literally tropical paradise... like something out of boyhood, like Robinson Crusoe or Treasure Island. And now? Lan'll be leaving soon. Probably this time. We had a few problems with her qualifications, but... I think we've got that sorted out. Do you fake qualifications up here? You can do anything you like. Most of our time is spent working out who these people are, making them prove that they exist. [sighs] What are qualifications? Slips of paper. Who does it hurt if you make a few up? Find homes for a few more people. [sighs] They're gonna nail you, Ralph. I know. I'll be recalled. That's all right. I'll have Lan. [sighs] She deserves a second chance, doesn't she? -[chattering] -[pop music playing] Good news. Good news. -I have had good news. -Another boat? Who, may I ask, is this? A friend. [speaks foreign language] Many, many months have been spent tracking down these children. And we only have your word for it that they've been found again. This time we have positive identification. Of course, we can waste days sending photographs if you want. Thank you. You'll get the rest when they arrive. No profit, no job. Ling's golden rule. MINOU: It's all here. Every cent. [groans] They'd better be on that boat, Ling. If they're not, you'll try harder next time... for no more money. -Understand? -[Ling groans] [Ling exhales] When my children arrive, I'll give you another $5,000. -[crickets chirping] -[dog barks] JUDITH: Mmm. Think Minou's children will come? She'll go crazy if they don't. [sighs] [speaks foreign language] [brakes screech] Wait for me! [man shouts] [chattering] MAN: Right over here. MINOU: Oh, good. We've got the fridge. Victory wings. [chuckles] For good luck. Enough. This is the sand bank. I can see them... calling out. A few months ago, a big boat arrived from Vietnam in rough weather. Two hundred people were drowned here. The bodies floated ashore and along the beaches for days. The Malays celebrated every time they found a corpse. They were content with the sacrifice and left the next boat alone. Yep. They love sacrifice, as long as it's someone else dying. [ship's horn blowing] [man shouting] -[chattering] -G'day. Hello. Hi. -Hello. -Hello. -Hi. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -Hi. -Hello. [woman on loudspeaker, distorted] [chattering] MINOU: The market stalls have all been destroyed. [woman on loudspeaker continues] RALPH: I'm going to find Lan. It'll take me a while unloading the refrigerator. Go with Ralph. It'll look better. [insects chirping, buzzing] Mr. Hamilton, our new captain would like to speak with you. Fine. -[chattering] -[dog barking] I see you've cleaned up the black market. Good thing. You see, Mr. Hamilton, there has been some embarrassment. What sort? [chuckles] Nothing for you to worry about... Mr. Hamilton. [chuckling] -MAN: Hello. -RALPH: Hello. CHILDREN: Hello. Hello. [baby crying] MAN: Hello. -[insect buzzing] -RALPH: Hello. Mmm. -WOMAN: Hello! -RALPH: Hello. -Hello. -RALPH: How are you? [shutter clicks] [sighs] [shutter clicks] [man coughing] This man was a colonel. Wang Ho is a doctor. [coughing continues] RALPH: And my friend here... Hello. RALPH: An economist. May I? [shutter clicks] Are you American? Australian. We might see you there... perhaps. -RALPH: Come on. -Mr. Hamilton will let you know where I am. JUDITH: Good luck. -Hello. -RALPH: Hello. JUDITH: Hello. [crying] Hey. [speaks foreign language] Ralph? Lan. [speaks foreign language] -[moans] -[foreign language] [foreign language] Is Lan in here? Oh, my God. Lan, what happened? I wouldn't tell them anything. RALPH: Who did this to you? The new police captain has disgraced me. [Minou speaks foreign language] [cheering] [laughing] [man shouts] RALPH [shouting]: Let me in there! I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna stay here till you bastards let me in. I'll bring the whole bloody crowd in there with me. -Where is the captain? -[whistle blows] RALPH: I'll shave his bloody head! -[groans] -[chattering] [whistle blows] [Speaking Foreign Language] MAN: His spleen is ruptured. He might die in the next couple of hours. I can do nothing here. If we had drugs, I could save so many. I know. I'll bring medicine next time. These people are seriously ill. I'll bring them back as soon as they're better. Don't worry. You have my word. [engine chugging] [shouting, chattering] Lady Hobday! Lady Hobday! [Minou shouts] LING: This time, I'm hundred-percent sure. [Minou gasps] Minou! See you later on. Take care. [car starts] Uh, intensive care? How is he? They've already operated. He's probably still unconscious. They think he's going to be okay. Show us where he is. It's all over K.L. about the girl. [ragged breathing] [takes a deep breath] I'm gonna get you better and take you home. So you're in the black market with Ralph, are you? Lan was. That's why they shaved her head. Ralph does the visas. What do you do? Supplies? Supplies? What is this black market crap, Judith? Those people need food, medicine. Oh, so you think it's all right to take what little money they have? I don't see your government handing out food parcels every day. Judith, people don't leave Vietnam -to end up on Bidong Island. -[sighs] They want to go to America, Switzerland, Australia. They live like dogs. You know, someone has to supply them with the basic needs. Hey! Stop! -JUDITH: Minou. -Judith. Judith, I need you. They're coming. They're landing at Turtle Beach. -That's the only point where the tide will allow it. -Turtle Beach. Oh, God. I know they will be there this time. Don't go. You'll be hurt. -The villagers want blood. -Please, Judith. I can't do it without you. You swim! [engine stops] I hate this place. I won't forget this, Judith. Kanan's in the black market with Ralph, isn't he? He supplies it. Why didn't you warn me? What's there to warn? I need him. He knows a lot of people. I would have never found Mr. Ling without him. He is expensive, but he gets me the best. You mean he takes money from you? -Of course. -[groans] JUDITH [whispering]: Jesus. I don't believe it. [exhales] What's wrong? Feeling dirty because you slept with him. Look, we're all dirty here. Even you. You profit from the boat people your own way. You've got your story now, haven't you? [sighs] [gull squawking] God! They are here! Judith! Shit. [shutter clicking] Judith! Come on. [grunting] [grunting] Minou has to be here. You don't. Why don't you come back to town with me, and we'll wait there. -[sighs] -MINOU: Judith! There's gonna be trouble, Judith. Give it to me. [hissing] [panting] They're there. I just know it. MEN: Hello! Hello! -Let's go. -There's not enough air in this. Judith? Whatever happens, save my children. Please. [shouting] Get the oars! Don't go. Look! Judith, they want blood, and I don't want it to be yours. Well, just talk to them, Kanan. Make them stop. You know their language. Help us! But, Minou, you can't take this out. The pump. Get the pump! [shouting] [shouting] [chanting in native language] [panting] [shouting] -Lai. -GIRL: Mama! Kwok-Kwan. Baby. -[chattering] -MINOU: Oh, baby. [panting] [shouting continues] CHILD: Mama! Stay back! Don't come. CHILD [wailing]: Mama! [shouting] [gunshot] Stay in! -Mama! -Mama! [gunshot] [screaming] [shouting] CHILD: Ma! CHILD: Ma! ALL: Mama! [ragged breathing] -[children scream] -Minou! Ma! Mama! Kwok-Kwan! Kwok-Kwan! [groans] [whispering] It's okay, Kwok-Kwan. It's okay. Oh, Lai. It's all right. It's gonna be all right, kids. What's gonna happen? Are they gonna attack or what? KANAN: No, Judith. You bastard. You Westerners know nothing about sacrifice. They'll go home, and they'll say the rich Chinese woman's ghost will keep the others away. [speaks foreign language] You call it self-sacrifice. It's a very noble act. Judith, they're happy with the sacrifice. God, you talk a lot of crap. Come on, kids. JUDITH: Come on. -[chattering] -Judith, did you have any idea before you went to the beach that Lady Hobday would attempt suicide? How did you know the children were on board? Did Minou Hobday tell you what she was going to do? Could it have been just an accident? -JUDITH: It was... -[reporters fall silent] an act of extreme sacrifice. It was the only way she could have saved them. Minou Hobday was the bravest person I've ever met. MAN: That is all, ladies and gentlemen. There'll be a full press release later today. [reporters shouting] MAN: Where are the children? Where are the children now? [man over phone, faint] -Richard. -Yes, what is it? Richard, I'm gonna fight you for custody of the boys. I want them to live with me. I'm taking them out of boarding school. I have to get a bigger flat... maybe a house... with a yard. Why the change of heart? I think they might be missing their mother. I want my boys back. [chattering] Bye. Bye. [sighs] Peter! David! CHILDREN: Mommy! Peter! [laughing] Oh, let's have a look at you. -Ohh! Mmm. You all better now? -Yeah. -Oh, I've missed you. I missed you so much. -I missed you too. Mmm! [sighs]
