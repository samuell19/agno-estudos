MILTON AWAITS, JASON. YEAH, SURE. "MORTALS...THAT WOULD... FOLLOW...ME...LOVE..." HI. MORNING, RACHEL. I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK I WAS GOING TO TEACH TO AN EMPTY CLASSROOM. "VIRTUE... "SHE, ALONE, IS FREE. "SHE CAN...TEACH...YE... HOW TO....CLIMB..." "HIGHER THAN THE SPHERY CHIME." "OR IF VIRTUE FEEBLE WERE, HEAVEN ITSELF WOULD STOOP TO HER." YOU KNOW, RACHEL, WITHOUT THE REST OF YOUR CLASSMATES, IT’S PROBABLY BETTER IF WE DISCUSSED THIS NEXT SEMESTER AND TAKE AN EARLY BREAK. JANET, WHAT A SURPRISE. I AM JUST PREPARING FOR MY MILTON CONFERENCE. REALLY? SAM WAS TELLING ME YOU WERE JUST MAKING SOME COPIES OF PERSONAL MATERIALS ON THE FACULTY MACHINE. I’M SURE HE WAS. I’M HAPPY TO REIMBURSE THE COLLEGE-- LET ME FINISH. IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD BE WORKING NOW, TEACHING YOUR FINAL CLASS, NOT MAKING COPIES OR CERTAINLY NOT PREPARING FOR YOUR TRIP TO LAS VEGAS. I HAD PLANNED TO, BUT NOBODY TURNED UP, OR ALMOST NOBODY, SO I DISMISSED EARLY. HMM... ARE YOU HAPPY HERE, PACKARD? DO YOU LIKE TEACHING HERE? YES, VERY MUCH. MERRY CHRISTMAS, JANET. MWAH! FRANK. OF COURSE, MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU, AND MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU, SAM. MERRY CHRISTMAS, FRANK. WE GONNA HAVE ANOTHER CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON THIS YEAR? OH, I’M TELLIN’ YA, THE CATFISH ARE LOOKIN’ GOOD, BUDDY. THAT’S GOOD. YEAH. GO CATFISH! GO CATFISH! ALL RIGHT! GO! MERRY CHRISTMAS TO BILL AND THE 2 KIDS! Janet: MERRY CHRISTMAS, FRANK. MERRY CHRISTMAS, SAM! I ADMIRE YOUR ENTHUSIASM FOR THOSE TWO. BROWN-NOSE, PACK. BROWN-NOSE. YOU KISS JANET’S BUTT, AND I GUARANTEE SHE’LL LET BYGONES BE BYGONES. YES, BUT TELLING A JOKE IN CLASS IS HARDLY A CAPITAL OFFENSE. I’M NOT GOING TO GROVEL FOR SOMETHING I DIDN’T THINK WAS WRONG. I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU. [PLAYFULLY SOBBING] IT’S JUST NOT FAIR. YOU SURE YOU DON’T MIND LOOKING FOR SALLY WHILE YOU’RE IN VEGAS? NO, OF COURSE NOT. I TRY TO REACH HER, AND SHE JUST DOESN’T CALL BACK. EH, IT’S A DADDY’S WORRY. IT’D BE SO, SO NICE IF I COULD SEE HER FOR CHRISTMAS. IT’S NOT A PROBLEM. I TELL YOU, I’M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING SALLY AGAIN. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, SHE LOVES YOU. YOU’RE THE ONLY PROFESSOR THAT DIDN’T FAIL HER. HEY, UH... SANTA BROUGHT YOU A GIFT. OH, HE DID? HERE. WOW. OPEN IT. IT’S FOR VEGAS. GOOD LUCK. WELL, I APPRECIATE IT, BUT IT’S NOT A HOLIDAY, IT’S A CONFERENCE, AND I DON’T GAMBLE. WELL, YOU SHOULD GAMBLE, ’CAUSE NOW YOU’RE GONNA HAVE GOOD LUCK. FIRST YOU SCORE AT THE TABLE, AND THEN YOU SCORE SOME SKIRT. [SCOTTISH ACCENT] "WITH HER BUTTOCKS BROAD "AND BREASTES ROUND AND HIGH, SHE WAS HAIR A’FAIR..." OHH! I CAN’T WAIT TILL YOU COME HOME AND TELL ME SOME WAR STORIES! HA HA! FRANK. GOOD EVENING, SIR. THANK YOU. I’M WITH THE MILTON CONFERENCE, AND I THINK IT’S IN THE DUGOUT ROOM. DUGOUT ROOM, RIGHT THROUGH THOSE DOORS. THANK YOU. [DOOR OPENS] AHH...WELCOME. HELLO, HERB. TO THE LAST MILTON CONFERENCE. OH, THE NEW NAME DIDN’T HELP. I’VE--I’VE TOLD YOU WHO I AM. I’M LOOKING FOR SALLY. WHAT ARE YOU, SOME KIND OF PRIVATE DETECTIVE OR SOMETHING? NO. I’M AN OLD ENGLISH PROFESSOR OF HERS. BULL--BULLSHIT. FUCK OFF. I’M HERE FOR A CONFERENCE. I--I JUST WANT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HER. RECITE SOME ENGLISH LITERATURE. WHAT? SEE? YOU’RE FULL OF SHIT. OH, UM, ALL RIGHT. [SCOTTISH ACCENT] "WHEN THAT APRILE "WITH ITS SHOWERS SWEET... THE DROUGHT OF MARCH HATH PIERCED TO THE ROOT." HOW ABOUT SOMETHING IN ENGLISH? UM, YOU EVER HEARD SHAKESPEARE? "TELL ME, WHERE IS FANCY BREAD, "IN THE HEART OR IN THE HEAD? "HOW BEGOT, HOW NOURISHED? "REPLY, REPLY, "IF ENGENDER’D BY THE EYES WITH GAZING FED, "THEN FANCY DIES IN THE CRADLE WHERE IT LIES. "LET US ALL RING FANCY’S KNELL. I’LL BEGIN IT. DING DONG, DING DONG BELL." OK, ALL RIGHT, SALLY’S AT WORK AT THE PARADISE INN. IS THAT A HOTEL? IT’S A RESTAURANT, SEAFOOD, ACTUALLY. HMM. THANK YOU. WHAT’S YOUR NAME? SAMANTHA. EXCUSE ME. THIS IS THE PARADISE INN? WELL, IT SURE IS, HONEY. WHERE’S THE DINING ROOM? DINING ROOM? THERE’S NO DINING ROOM HERE. I’M A LITTLE CONFUSED. IS THIS A... BROTHEL? THIS IS THE BEST LEGAL BROTHEL IN ALL OF NEVADA. YOU WANT ME TO SEND THE GIRLS OUT? YES. THEY’LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE. AHEM. LADIES. THIS IS CRYSTAL... AND SANDY... AND CHANTEL... AND PAULA... AND THIS, THIS IS NATALIE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A CHOICE, SIR? N-NATALIE. SO YOU’VE FOUND OUT MY SINFUL SECRET. I BET YOU’RE GONNA GIVE ME A MORALITY TALK NOW. WELL, YOU’RE WELCOME TO TRY THE "WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE" SPEECH. I GET THAT ALL THE TIME. USUALLY AFTERWARD, THOUGH. AREN’T YOU SHOCKED? I’M SPEECHLESS. WHAT DO YOU THINK? DON’T YOU WISH I’D DONE THAT IN CLASS? YOUR FATHER ASKED ME TO CHECK UP ON YOU. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL HIM? YOU CAN KEEP A SECRET, CAN’T YOU? I DON’T KNOW. DON’T GO YET. SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO GO. I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU’RE SO AFRAID. I SAW THE WAY YOU USED TO LOOK AT ME IN CLASS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU HAD SUCH A CRUSH ON ME. EVERYBODY KNEW ABOUT IT. I’LL TELL YOUR FATHER I COULDN’T FIND YOU. WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE’S PLENTY OF OTHER PRETTY GIRLS HERE IF YOU DON’T LIKE ME. I MEAN, YOU SHOULD STAY A WHILE AND HAVE SOME FUN. THAT’S FROM YOUR FATHER. Packard: SO, I GAVE HER THE TICKET, AND I LEFT. I MEAN...IT’S THE DAMNEDEST THING. I DON’T THINK SO AT ALL. I MEAN, YOU GOT A CHANCE TO NAIL YOUR DREAM GIRL. THAT’S NOT THE POINT. I MEAN, BESIDES, FRANK’S MY FRIEND. BUT SHE’S IN TROUBLE. AND I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO TELL HIM. I WOULDN’T TELL HIM ANYTHING AT ALL. BUT ISN’T IT MY MORAL OBLIGATION? LOOK AT WHERE MORALITY AND OBLIGATION HAVE GOTTEN YOU. I MEAN, NO OFFENSE, PACK, BUT YOU’RE NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER, RIGHT? SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WRONG BECAUSE MAYBE IT FEELS RIGHT. WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE MORAL RELATIVISM. COME WITH ME FOR A SECOND. Man: 7, WINNER, 7. FRONT LINE WINNER 7. WE GOT A SHOOTER NOW. GET YOUR BETS DOWN. 7 OR 11. HEY, COME ON. SAME LUCKY SHOOTER COMIN’ BACK ON... YOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE LOSE AT GAMBLING? PEOPLE LOSE MONEY AT GAMBLING BECAUSE THEY TRY TO WIN HONESTLY AND SQUARELY, ACCORDING TO THE RULES. BUT THE HOUSE DOESN’T PLAY ITS RULES. THE HOUSE BUILDS IN A 10% ADVANTAGES FOR ITSELF, SO THE SQUARES, THEY GET SLOWLY FUCKED, RIGHT? THE WAY TO WIN IS TO BET AGAINST THE SUCKERS. BET THE HOUSE-- WRONG BETTING. CRAPS BETTING IS WHAT WORKS. YOU GO AGAINST WHAT SEEMS RIGHT AND WIN. LOOK, I KNOW YOU’RE TRYING TO SET ME STRAIGHT, BUT MY SYSTEM, THE OLD SYSTEM OF GOOD AND BAD AND RIGHT AND WRONG, WORKS. WELL, I’M GONNA JOIN THE GAME. ARE YOU INTERESTED? NO. NO, I DON’T THINK SO, BUT GOOD LUCK. [VELCRO SNAPS] Man: 6, EASY 6. RIGHT ON 6. YO, 11! WHERE YOUR 11? FRONT LINE ON 11! COME ON, NOW. GET ’EM DOWN. WE GOT A SHOOTER, FOLKS. COMIN’ OUT AGAIN, NOW.

YOU WANT TO SPEND IT SOMEWHERE, YOU WANNA GO SOMEWHERE, YOU LET ME KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SHOULD GIVE ME A BUCK HERE. I CAN WIN A LOT OF MONEY FOR YOU. I FEEL THIS THING’S GONNA WIN, IT’S GONNA HIT. LOOK. GOD! ELVIS... THERE IS SOMEWHERE I’D LIKE TO GO. WELL, LET ME TAKE YOU THERE. I GOT A SWEET LIMO. IT’S A 1965 HEARSE. NICE VINTAGE LIMO. SO, WHAT DO YOU PLAY? CRAPS. OH, CRAPS. A VET BUDDY OF MINE, JASON, HE’S A BIG CRAPS PLAYER. IN NAM, HE CAUGHT A CHUNK OF V.C. MORTAR SHRAPNEL RIGHT IN THE TEMPLE. DOCTORS WOULDN’T REMOVE IT, ’CAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD KILL HIM, SO THEY LEFT IT IN. ONLY THING IS, NOW HE CAN’T GET TOO CLOSE TO A MAGNETIC FIELD. IT GIVES HIM A BIG FUCKIN’ HEADACHE. WELL, JASON’S A CRAPS PLAYER, RIGHT? SO HE’S GOT TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CRAP TABLE. DO YOU WANT TO ASK WHY? WHY? BECAUSE EACH END OF THE CRAPS TABLE IS MAGNETIZED. SO IF HE GETS TOO CLOSE TO THE ENDS, HE GETS ANOTHER BIG FUCKIN’ HEADACHE. YOU LOOK SURPRISED. AH, FIX IS IN. WHEN THE TABLE GETS ON A ROLL, THE HOUSE SWITCHES OUT THE DICE. THEY DROP A PAIR OF TRICK DICE WITH METAL IN IT, MADE IT TURN SEVENS ON THE ROLL AND BUSTS THE TABLE. WHEW. MY BUDDY--POOR SUCKER. I GOTTA TELL YOU. HE LOSES MONEY LIKE CRAZY. I MEAN, SCREAMIN’ CRAZY. IF HE KNOWS IT’S FIXED, WHY DOESN’T HE BET THE HOUSE? I DID. THE GUY’S GOT A BIG PIECE OF METAL IN HIS FUCKIN’ HEAD. NOW, ME, I WANT TO SUE ’EM, BUT I CAN’T FIND A LAWYER GOOD ENOUGH TO REPRESENT ME. YOU A LAWYER? NO. GOOD. I HATE THOSE COCKSUCKERS. OHH. YOU’RE PRETTY QUIET. I GET LIKE THAT SOMETIMES. THINKING. JUST THINKING. AH. YOU A VET? UM...UH, NO. NO, NOT A VET. YOU EVER SEEN RAMBO? I’VE HEARD OF IT. THAT WAS ME. REALLY? JOHN RAMBO. IT’S BASED ON ME. YEAH, I WAS, UH, SPECIAL FORCES, SNIPER, IN NAM. ’70, ’72. COUNTERINSURGENCE BEHIND ENEMY LINES. 199 CONFIRMED KILLS. WOW. THAT’S INCREDIBLE. YEAH, THEN THE WAR ENDED. STATESIDE, EVERYTHING TURNED TO SHIT. OLD STORY, OLD STORY, OLD STORY. WELL, AT LEAST YOU GOT TO SELL YOURS TO HOLLYWOOD. WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDIN’? FUCKERS STOLE IT, CHANGED EVERYTHING INTO BULLSHIT. I’M SORRY. SO... CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT ELVIS? FUCK ELVIS. DON’T GET ME STARTED ON FUCKIN’ ELVIS. [DEEP SIGH] IT’S GETTIN’ THAT I CAN’T EVEN TAKE HER SMELL SO LONG... Packard, sighing: I MUST BE CRAZY. Sally: I THINK I’M GONNA CALL YOU PACK. DR. SCHMIDT JUST SOUNDS WEIRD. SOMETHING STRANGE HAS HAPPENED THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. IT’S AS IF SOMETHING HAS-- HAS CHANGED. I...THINK IT’S GOOD, PACK. I MEAN, MAYBE YOU’RE JUST COMING OUT OF YOUR SHELL, HAVE A SEAT NEXT TO ME. SO, IN HONOR OF YOUR FIRST TIME, I’M GONNA GIVE YOU THE PARADISE SPECIAL FOR THE PRICE OF THE FRENCH DATE. OH. THAT’S INTERCOURSE? YEAH. YEAH, EVERYTHING.

I COULDN’T BELIEVE THAT YOU DIDN’T CATCH HER. DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR NICKNAME AT SCHOOL WAS? UM...DR. DIRTY JOKES, RIGHT? WELL, YEAH. THEY ALSO CALLED YOU "PROFESSOR PACK-A-SHIT." SO, MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE. JUST DON’T GET UNDER THE COVERS. OH, CHRIST. I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THIS. [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE? [NO AUDIO] YOUR ORGASM, WAS IT REAL? [CHUCKLES] YEAH. SURE. OF COURSE, PACK. SALLY, I DON’T MEAN TO LECTURE YOU, BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I COULD ASK YOU THE SAME THING. NO, SERIOUSLY. I’M WORRIED ABOUT YOU. WHAT’LL BECOME OF YOU IF YOU STAY HERE? [SIGHS] LOOK... LOOK, YOU-- YOU PAID TO FUCK, AND I’M TIRED OF CHATTING, SO OUR SESSION’S OVER. I COULD HELP YOU, IF YOU’D LET ME. RIGHT.

I LOVE YOU. [DECK THE HALLS PLAYING] [SIGHS] I’D LIKE TO BEGIN OUR DISCUSSION OF EROTIC IMAGES IN MILTON BY STARTING WITH A BRIEF RECITATION MATCHED WITH SELECTED IMAGES. "BUT COME THOU GODDESS FAIR AND FREE, "IN HEAVEN YCLEPED EUPHROSYNE, AND TO MEN, HEART-EASING MIRTH..." "WHOM LOVELY VENUS AT A BIRTH..." SO ROSY, SO PINK. MAI HELP YOU, MA’AM? YEAH.

DID YOU KNOW THAT HERE IN CLARK COUNTY, YOU CAN BE ARRESTED FOR PATRONIZING A HOOKER LIKE SALLY? THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION, OFFICER. DON’T MENTION IT. FUCKIN’ LIMP DICK. WHAT A RUDE MAN. I MEAN, DOES THAT HAPPEN OFTEN? YEAH. IT’S VEGAS. HA HA HA. [GURGLING] AHH. AH. AGAIN. UHH. COOL. BEAUTIFUL. HA HA HA. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [SNAPPING PICTURES] DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL A HERD OF MASTURBATING CATTLE? BEEF STROGANOFF. OH. THE STRANGE THING-- I ALMOST GOT FIRED FOR TELLING THAT SILLY LITTLE JOKE. MAYBE THAT WOULD’VE BEEN BEST. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, I MEAN, IT’S OBVIOUS YOU--YOU DON’T FIT IN THERE. OH. WELL, FITTING IN HAS NEVER BEEN EASY FOR ME. THAT’S WHY I LEFT ENGLAND. AMERICAN COLLEGES, WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED, WERE FREE AND LOOSE, REFUGES FOR INTELLECTUALISM AND RADICAL THINKING. NOW THEY’RE JUST PART OF THE BIG CORPORATE ECONOMY, LIKE A DEPARTMENT STORE. THE ADMINISTRATORS ARE LIKE STORE MANAGERS. THE PROFESSORS ARE THE CLERKS, AND THE STUDENTS ARE THE ALMIGHTY CUSTOMERS. [SCOFFS] WHY DO YOU LET EVERYONE PUSH YOU AROUND? WHO? EVERYONE. THE--THE-- THE STUDENTS, FACULTY. ESPECIALLY THE STUDENTS. WELL, AS I SAID, THE STUDENTS ARE THE CUSTOMERS, AND THE CUSTOMERS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT. DO YOU KNOW WHEN I GAVE MY LAST FAIL? IT WAS BEFORE YOUR TIME, NEARLY 7 YEARS AGO-- A GIRL CALLED NORA VELLUM. WELL, NORA VELLUM HARDLY EVER CAME TO CLASS, SHE NEVER DID HOMEWORK, DID A MISERABLE EXAM, AND SHE WAS ARGUMENTATIVE IN MY CONFERENCE WITH HER. I HAD NO HESITATION IN FAILING HER. WELL...SHE COMPLAINED TO DEAN VANDERPOOL THAT THE REASON SHE DIDN’T COME TO CLASS WAS TO PROTEST THE FACT THAT I ONLY TAUGHT ONE WOMAN WRITER IN MY RENAISSANCE FICTION SEMINAR. SHE SAID I WAS SEXIST. WELL, THE DEAN INSTRUCTED ME TO GIVE HER A B-PLUS AND TO RECONSIDER MY CURRICULUM. SO, WHAT DID YOU DO? AT FIRST, I THOUGHT ABOUT QUITTING. THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT FIGHTING. AND THEN I COMPROMISED. I GAVE NORA HER GRADE, BUT I WENT ON TEACHING WHAT I WANTED TO TEACH. BUT AS A CONCESSION, I ONLY EVER GIVE STUDENTS As AND Bs SINCE THEN. THAT WAY, WELL, EVERYONE’S SATISFIED. I--I LOOK GOOD, AS IF I’M DOING A GREAT JOB, THE STUDENTS GET THE GRADES THEY WANT BUT ARE NEVER PREPARED TO WORK FOR, AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS HAPPY. ARE YOU HAPPY? YES, OF COURSE. I MEAN, WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? [RINGS] UH... [RING] COULD YOU GET THAT? [RING] HELLO? HEY, PACK. PACK, IT’S FRANK. HEY. SALLY’S COMING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. YEAH. SHE SAID THAT YOU FOUND HER. WHY DIDN’T YOU CALL ME AND TELL ME? BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO BE THE ONE TO TELL YOU. THAT’S WHAT I FIGURED. LISTEN... I JUST CAN’T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE IT. OH, IT’S NOTHING. HEY, PACK, ARE WE GONNA-- SHH, SHH! WHAT’S THAT? YOU GOT SOMEBODY THERE? UH, DON’T BE RIDICULOUS. YOU GOT LUCKY! [LAUGHS] YOU GOT LUCKY! THERE’S SOMEBODY WITH YOU, ISN’T THERE? YOU KNOW I’M NOT LIKE THAT, FRANK. THE RABBIT’S FOOT WORKED! HUH? [LAUGHS] HEY, LET ME TALK TO HER. I DON’T THINK THAT’S A GOOD IDEA. COME ON. PUT THE PHONE UP TO HER EAR. HIYA, SWEETHEART. WHAT’S YOUR NAME, HONEY? COME ON. TALK TO ME, BABY. I HAVE TO GO NOW, FRANK. YES. BYE-BYE. YOU DIDN’T TELL ME YOU’D CALLED FRANK. IT DOESN’T MATTER. I’D JUST LIKED TO HAVE BEEN MORE PREPARED. YOU’RE TREATING THE TEXT LIKE IT’S DEAD, IRV, AND THAT YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE QUALIFIED TO DO THE POSTMORTEM. I--I HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR THE FORM. Irv: YOU HAVE MORE RESPECT, SUDDENLY. MILTON ENSLAVED HIS DAUGHTERS TO READ TO HIM AFTER HE WENT BLIND. DOESN’T THAT OUTRAGE YOU? Irv: PACK. PACKARD. PACKARD. BE THE VOICE OF REASON. SPEAK TO THIS YOUNG MAN. [CHUCKLES] YOU’RE ACTING REALLY STRANGE, PACK. WHAT’S GOTTEN INTO YOU? [SIGHS] [BEEP] TELL ME ABOUT THE GIRL. FORGET IT. AW, COME ON. [CHUCKLES] COME ON. TELL ME. YOU KNOW, I’M GONNA GET IT OUT OF YA, PACK. YOU HAD SOMEBODY IN YOUR ROOM, DIDN’T YA? HUH? ADMIT IT. OK. YOU WIN. LISTEN, THERE WAS A STREETWALKER. I GAVE HER $100. SHE WAS THRILLED. I WAS THRILLED. THAT’S IT. THAT’S ALL. I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU FINALLY CAME DOWN OFF YOUR PERCH AND HAD SEX WITH SOMEBODY! OH, MAN! HEY, DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT. DON’T WORRY. WHAT ARE THOSE PEEP-SHOW BEAUTIES GONNA THINK ABOUT YOU NOW, THOUGH? [LAUGHING] I SAID I DIDN’T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT, FRANK. WHAT HAPPENED? SOMETHING WENT WRONG? NOTHING WENT WRONG, FRANK. SOMETHING WENT WRONG. WHAT HAPPENED? ALL RIGHT. SHE HAD A NAME LIKE, WHAT? LIKE ONE OF THOSE SUCCULENT HOOKER NAMES, UH, CANDY, HONEY, PEACHES? WHAT? NATALIE. HER NAME WAS NATALIE. NATALIE?! NATALIE? I’LL SEE YOU LATER, FRANK. NATALIE. [LAUGHS] ALL RIGHT! [LAUGHING] WHAT? [LAUGHS] NO, I-- THE DECORATIONS. I PUT ’EM OUT. YOU PUT ’EM UP. MMM. HUH? HELLO, PACK. WELCOME TO OUR HUMBLE ABODE, AND A MERRY CHRISTMAS EVE TO YOU. [CHUCKLES] WELL, THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. IT’S, UH, A LONG TIME SINCE I PUT DECORATIONS ON A CHRISTMAS TREE. HELLO, SALLY. HI. NOW, THAT’S NOT HOW WE WERE RAISED, SALLY. STAND UP AND SHAKE DR. SCHMIDT’S HAND. IT’S ALL RIGHT, FRANK. I MEAN, SALLY AND I SAW EACH OTHER IN VEGAS. Frank: ALL RIGHT. HAVE A SEAT. UH, SHOULDN’T WE BEGIN THE DECORATIONS? WELL, THAT’S WHAT I WANTED TO DO. IT WAS ALL ABOUT SALLY. AND FOR SOME REASON, SALLY’S NOT INTERESTED. AHH! Frank: ALL RIGHT. WHY DON’T YOU JUST SIT DOWN AND HAVE A DRINK? THE BEER’S FOR YOU. Frank: OH, I’M SORRY. I FORGOT THE, UH, BOTTLE OPENER. I’LL GO GET YOU ONE. I THINK I HAVE ONE ON MY KEY CHAIN. WHERE’S THE RABBIT’S FOOT THAT I GAVE YOU? OH, IT’S AT HOME. AT HOME. WHY? DID YOU PUT SOMETHING NEW ON THERE? WELL, NOTHING SPECIAL. WELL, WHY ARE YOU BEING SO SECRETIVE? FRANK, LEAVE HIM ALONE. YOU’RE ALWAYS PUSHING PEOPLE AROUND. WELL, IT’S NOT A PROBLEM. HERE. OH. [CHUCKLES] PARADISE INN. IT’S A HOTEL OR SOMETHING? IT’S A RESTAURANT. RESTAURANT. AH. [CHUCKLES] WELL, SEE, THAT WASN’T SO DIFFICULT, WAS IT? COME ON, PACK. I BET SALLY WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR ADVENTURES. [LAUGHS] WELL, SOME OF IT WAS FUN. FUN. FUN! I THINK IT WAS MORE THAN JUST FUN! HUH? NOW’S NOT THE TIME, FRANK. [LAUGHS] COME ON! TELL US ABOUT, UH, NATALIE, HUH? NATALIE! [LAUGHS] COME ON. OH, MAN! DICE, WOMEN, AND BOOZE! OH! I WISH I’D BEEN WITH YA! VIVA LAS VEGAS! YEAH. VIVA LAS VEGAS, FRANK. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] [RING] HELLO? HELLO, SALLY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING CALLING ME HERE? [GROANS] OK. I’LL--OK. I’LL-- I’LL SEE YOU AT 8:00. I--I DON’T KNOW. TEACHING’S NOT WORSE THAN ANY OTHER JOB. YES, BUT IT’S NO BETTER. WELL, THEN, QUIT, IF-- IF YOU DON’T LIKE IT. I MEAN... CHANGE YOUR LIFE. WELL, THAT’S IT EXACTLY. I THOUGHT I COULD MOVE TO VEGAS AND MAYBE GET A JOB IN A CASINO. AND YOU AND I-- [LAUGHS] THAT--THAT’S JUST NOT REALISTIC, PACK. I KNOW. BUT I-I’M SICK OF BEING REALISTIC. BEFORE I MET YOU, SALLY, MY LIFE WAS A TRIUMPH OF REALISM OVER FANTASY, OF MATURITY OVER PASSION. MY LIFE HAS BEEN RUINED BY A COWERING FEAR OF CHANGE. [LAUGHS] YOU’RE JUST GETTING A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY, I THINK. I GUESS I AM. AND I LIKE IT. I’M IN LOVE WITH YOU, SALLY. WELL, THERE’S JUST ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT. WHAT? I’M--I’M NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU. YOU’RE NOT? NO. WELL, I CAN MAKE YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ME. IT DOESN’T WORK LIKE THAT. BUT YOU LIKE ME. YEAH. AND... THAT’S A START. THAT’S ENOUGH, INITIALLY. I MEAN, I’M JUST A LITTLE FURTHER AHEAD THAN YOU. YOU’RE--YOU’RE MILES AHEAD OF ME. I-- THIS WAS JUST, YOU KNOW, LIKE... A FUCK OR TWO. YOU’LL-- YOU’LL SEE. [SIGHS] YOU’LL COOL DOWN IN A LITTLE BIT, AND THINGS’LL GO BACK TO NORMAL, AND I’LL GO BACK TO VEGAS, AND YOU’LL... START TEACHING AGAIN, AND, YOU KNOW, IT’LL JUST BE A MEMORY TO YOU. THAT’S NOT WHAT I WANT. WELL, THAT’S WHAT I WANT. THEN WHERE DOES IT LEAVE US? WELL, LET’S HAVE SUPPER. UM, I--I ATE BEFORE I CAME OVER. I--I SHOULD GO. [DOOR CREAKING] FRANK? FRANK. FRANK. YOU STINK. YOU MISERABLE PIECE OF SHIT. WHAT’S GOING ON? YOU’RE--YOU’RE DRINKING. I’M SORRY, FRANK. YOU’RE SORRY? YOU SAY YOU’RE SORRY... AND YOU’VE RUINED MY DAUGHTER’S FUCKING LIFE. I HAVEN’T RUINED HER LIFE. YOU’VE RUINED YOUR LIFE. I’LL COME BACK, AND WE’LL TALK ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU’VE CALMED DOWN. YOU DON’T GET IT, DO YOU? YOU’RE FINISHED. IT’S OVER. I’M GOING TO SEE YOU FRY. YOU TURNED MY DAUGHTER INTO A WHORE. THAT’S RIDICULOUS. YOU’RE GOING TO STAND THERE AND DENY THAT TO MY FACE? I THINK SOMETHING’S BURNING. YOU PRETENDED TO BE MY FRIEND! YOU MADE A MONKEY OUT OF ME! I’M LEAVING. SALLY-- SALLY’S NOT GOING TO SEE YOU ANYMORE. SHE’S GROUNDED. GROUNDED? FRANK, SHE’S NOT A CHILD. YOU’RE CHALLENGING ME? YOU FORCED SEX ON MY DAUGHTER! DON’T YOU CHALLENGE ME! PUNCH ME, FRANK. I DESERVE IT. YOU’LL FEEL BETTER. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL IT WHEN A GROWN MAN FORCES HIMSELF ON A YOUNG GIRL? JUST PUNCH ME. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL IT? I DIDN’T FORCE ANYTHING ON SALLY. RAPE. THAT’S WHAT THEY CALL IT. THEY CALL IT-- THEY CALL IT RAPE. GET IT OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM. PUNCH ME OR KICK ME OR SOMETHING! I DON’T EVEN NEED TO PUNCH YOU. I’VE ALREADY FAXED THE PICTURES TO JANET VANDERPOOL, AND I TOLD HER ABOUT THE FELON SHE’S GOT WORKING IN HER ENGLISH DEPARTMENT. AND I’VE CALLED THE POLICE AND MY ATTORNEY, AND THERE’S GOING TO BE A FULL INVESTIGATION OF ALL THE TIMES YOU TOLD OBSCENE JOKES IN FRONT OF YOUR CLASS AND OF ALL THE TIMES YOU FORCED SEX ON YOUR STUDENTS! FRANK, THAT’S OUTRAGEOUS! YOU’RE FUCKED! YOU’RE FINISHED. I CAME HERE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU, TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED IN VEGAS, BUT THIS--THIS IS CRAZY! I’M LEAVING. MERRY CHRISTMAS. [GROANS] NOW GET OFF MY PROPERTY! OHH! I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA CONTROL MYSELF. IVERSON, YOU’VE GOT TO LEARN TO CONTROL YOURSELF! [FRANK GROANS] Frank: I HATE YOU, ASSHOLE! Packard: NUTTER. Packard: WELL, AREN’T YOU INTERESTED IN HEARING MY SIDE OF THE STORY? Janet: OH, OF COURSE, PACKARD, BUT WE WERE ABLE TO COME TO A DECISION WITHOUT YOU. WE’RE GONNA NEED YOU TO SIGN A FEW PAPERS. I DON’T CARE. I DON’T GIVE A SINGLE SHIT, BUT YOU CAN’T SUSPEND ME OR FIRE ME, BECAUSE I-- YOU QUIT? I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU, JANET, BECAUSE YOU SPEND ALL DAY IN YOUR IVORY TOWER LOOKING OUT OVER YOUR KINGDOM, BUT YOUR THRONE IS A CASTOFF CHAIR THAT’S BEEN FARTED IN BY 2 GENERATIONS OF VAIN, FRUSTRATED ADMINISTRATORS, AND YOUR KINGDOM IS A THIRD-RATE PROVINCIAL COLLEGE THAT HAS WHORED ITSELF OUT TO THE WHIMS OF ITS FICKLE, IGNORANT STUDENTS. OH, REALLY, PACKARD! DON’T SAY THINGS NOW THAT YOU WILL REGRET LATER. SAM, I’M NOT TALKING TO YOU, SO KINDLY SHUT THE FUCK UP. JANET, THE TRUTH IS, YOU’VE GROWN OLD AND SOLD OUT. YOU LIVE AND BREATHE FRAUD AND HYPOCRISY, AND YOU AND YOUR KIND CHEATED THE STUDENTS OF THEIR ONE OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING BY GIVING THEM DIPLOMAS I WOULDN’T WIPE MY ASS WITH.
