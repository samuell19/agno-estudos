[girl laughing] Blah! [girl shrieks] [both laughing] [laughing, shrieking] [girl] Teddy says come and play hide-and-seek. I'm fine here. Are you ready? And your letter? "Dear Daddy, come home soon. Love, Perdita." Come on, Perdita. Can't really come home, can he, Mummy? No. But he'd like to know he's not forgotten. Come on, sweetheart. Let's leave Mummy in peace. Take care of her, Annie. OK, let's see if you can catch me! Whoo-hoo! -You're looking! -I'm not. Yeah, no peeping! 1, 2, 3, 4... 5, 6, 7... Mummy? Auntie Annie! Come quick! Something bad! [screams] What?! -[Perdita] Mummy! -[Annie] Perdita, wait! Mummy! Mummy! Zelda! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! [gulls screeching] I've always lived on Skua, a tiny island off the coast of Scotland. I used to think it was the best place in the world. But that all changed a year ago. After Daddy was killed at sea, Mummy just couldn't live without him. Aunt Annie looked after me, but everyone else hated her. They said Mummy had poisoned the sea and killed off all the lobsters, so they couldn't fish anymore. They even called me "the witch's daughter." Then one day I found something that was going to change my life forever. [kids jeering] Leave me alone! -Let me see! -It's mine! I found it! My dad says the island's finished and it's all your fault! He says witches used to be burnt at the stake! What about it, shall we burn her?! Well, I don't care if she found the Mona Lisa. The girl is a menace. I'm telling you that girl is a curse on this island. It's a year since her mother took her own life and poisoned ours. A year since I caught my last lobster. If I had my way, she'd be packing her bags today. She's just a child. Aye, a witch's child. Second sight is a gift, not a curse. [man] It's not her fault, Annie, but you can't argue with facts. What facts? That a harmless young girl puts a curse on the sea, scares away every living creature? -It's the truth. -[man] Aye, that's right. Oh, and nothing to do with the tanker and the 30,000 gallons of crude oil she spilled. No lobsters means no income for the island and precious few visitors for my hotel. Our men can't feed their families. And that's all Perdita's fault, is it? -Do you really all believe that? -[murmurs of agreement] I believe your sister put a curse on the sea that took her husband's life, yes. And I believe you are a superstitious fool. [man] Annie, what it boils down to is this. Most of us on this council believe you and the girl would be better off somewhere else. It's nice of you to be so concerned. How many of you want us to go? [crowd] Aye! Hear, hear! Aye! I see. It's good to know who your friends are. -So you'll go? -No, Jock. This is my home. Perdita's too. We're family. I suppose he's part of the family, too. Mr Smith is my lodger, no more or less. [dog barking] Could have said something. They wouldn't listen to a stranger. Witch. [goat bleats] [dog barks] [woman] We've come all this way and you're not even sure. Look, Helen, the ship went down very close to this island. All the paintings were recovered except one. Now, if I'm right and this is the Salignac... Then it could be worth a fortune? If it's genuine. -Can I have a look? -What's the magic word? -[ship horn blows] -Please? Oh, look, we're nearly at Skua. Some good places to explore by the look of it. Wave. -[dog yips] -[boy] Uh, excuse me. Oh, sorry. -Come along, slow coach. -I'm coming. [goat bleats] Here on holiday, mister...? Uh, Jones. I'm here for the golf. You've only recently started playing. You're staying at the Lobster Pot Hotel and you're trying to quit smoking. Huh. How do you know all that? Well, one, your golf clubs. Brand new. Two, your luggage label. And three, your things are all yellow from nicotine. Obviously, trying to wean yourself off cigarettes onto the occasional cigar. Your son is quite the detective. He's not my dad. [man clears throat] I'm Tim's stepfather, Larry Hoggart. This is my wife Helen. -Charmed. -Hello. Don't mind him. He thinks he's Sherlock Holmes. [horn honks] Clearly. [car engine idling] [car door shuts] Mr and Mrs Hoggart? How do you do? -Hello. -Mr Jones. Ah, charmed. Jock and Betty Tarbutt from the Lobster Pot Hotel. So glad you could come. It's not every day someone finds what might turn out to be a masterpiece washed up on the beach. Stop, thief! Leave me alone! If you're gonna steal, you picked the wrong person. -[Helen] Tim! -This one's yours! Witch, witch, witch, witch, witch, witch, witch, witch... It's her library books. She's a bookaholic. The ferry sends at least half a dozen twice a week. You'll have to excuse Tim. He made a citizen's arrest on a shoplifter last week. Turned out to be the store detective. Well, he looked suspicious to me. I think you owe someone an apology, Tim. There's no need to apologize to her kind. -On your way, witch! -[Tim] Why'd you call her that? -Because that's what she is. -Don't start all that nonsense. The poor girl's father was lost at sea. And then her mother, Zelda, took her own life about a year later. They called her a witch, but she was just different. Next you'll be saying she doesn't have the second sight. Second sight? Seeing things, before they actually happen. You know, in your mind's eye. Premonitions. I don't believe in witches and spirits or ghosts. There's a perfectly logical explanation for everything. Let's wait and see how you feel after you've been here a couple of days. [Betty] Right. Let's get you all settled in at the hotel. Then you can come and see the painting, Mr Hoggart. [Perdita] "When shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning, or in rain?" And the second witch says, "When the hurly-burly's done, when the battle's lost and won." Says the third witch, "That will be ere set of sun." and then the first witch says, "Where the place?" Second witch: "Upon the heath." The third witch: "There to meet with--" [horn honks] Annie, it's Mr Hoggart, about the painting. Hello, welcome to Skua. Come in and have a look. [man] Hmm-mm. On second thoughts, I'll just go and fetch it for you. That's Birdy Smith. He's quite famous, actually. He writes books about birds. He's been here for nearly a year, and he's hardly said a word to anyone. Mr Smith, can I not tempt you down to the hotel for a meal? No, thanks. I've no lobster, but I do a fine haggis. What exactly is haggis? Well, you take sheep's heart, lungs, liver, touch of suet, touch of oatmeal, and Bob's your uncle. I think I'll pass, thank you. [sighs] Thank you. I'll look at it as soon as I get back to the hotel. -Take care of it. Bye, now. -[Helen] Bye. [car starts] It's downright rude not to invite them in. They've had a full day's travel, hours on the ferry. I came here for privacy and peace and quiet. We made a deal. And I've kept to it. But how do you expect us to lead an ordinary life when you go creeping around like some sly old tomcat? I just keep myself to myself. You've spoken to no one since you came. It's for the best. Trust me. My sister said, never trust a man who keeps secrets. Perdita, your lunch is ready. What's for lunch? Brains and kidney pie. Ah, great. Brains and kidney pie. Must be Tuesday. [Jock] I'm sorry, sir, there's no golf course on the island. -There never has been. -You're not serious. -Do you know how much this cost? -Hello there. Have you got somewhere I can park it? I knew there was something odd about him. Why bring golf clubs to a place with no golf course? Maybe he's on his way to another island. [Larry] Maybe Tim should mind his own business. [Tim] He definitely said, "I'm here for the golf." Listen, Super-Sleuth, why don't you just be an ordinary kid for a few days, OK? Absolutely Good chap. Not! [sighs] I thought we had a deal. Don't blame it on me, it's him. "Maybe Tim should mind his own business." "What's the magic word?" He treats me like a 5-year.old. Well, he means well. And he's very fond of you. Yeah, like I'm fond of cabbage. Oh, Tim, I miss him too, you know. But it's been four years and life has to go on, hmm? I'm going to have a bath. How about you make a start on that school project, huh? [sighs] Yeah, see you later. Summer holiday, day one. Larry, a pain, as usual. who seems to be following me. Weird place, weird people. Especially Mr Jones. Definitely more to him than meets the eye. Is it by somebody famous? I'm pretty sure it's a Claude Salignac, one of the minor Impressionists. [Helen] He was a student of Renoir. Talented, but never a star in his own right. [Betty] I didn't know you were an expert too. [Helen] Yes, we both work at the museum. The painting was en route to London when the ship went down. Hello, campers. So, is it the real McCoy? [Larry] Can't be certain till I've cleaned it up, but it looks promising. Can I go and explore? You be careful, young man. The tides come in very fast this time of year. [Larry] And do try not to arrest anyone. That's a good chap. I normally charge for being a flaming tourist attraction. Uh, it's my hobby. Do you mind? I suppose not. There's some who would, though. Gonna take me round to Carlin's Cave, Will? What is it this time: puffins, gannets? Got my eye on a pair of peregrine falcons. How's the fishing? Your money buys my time, Mr Smith, not my conversation. -Hi. -Hi. I want to say I'm sorry about the mix-up with the bags. People say you've got second sight. It's not true, is it? Witch's secret. There's no such thing as witches. -There is so. -OK, prove it. -Turn me into a frog. -That's not quite how it works. I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. Even if they've got toffees? I'm sorry about your mother. And your father. My dad died too. Tim, if I show you my secret hiding place, you promise you'll never, never, never tell? Never, never, never. Come on. [Perdita] This is my library. Sometimes, when the others are at school, I come here and read for hours. -You don't go to school? -I'm not allowed. Tim. [sighs] The others won't sit in class with me, so the Island Council turns a blind eye. Wow. Lucky. It's not lucky. I want to go. I want to learn, I want to make friends, but they won't let me. Mr Smith says it's just as well. He says mixing with others might take away my powers. Oh, we wouldn't want that, would we? Tim. What happened to your father? He was a policeman, chasing a stolen car. There was a crash. [Perdita] I'm sorry. Do you want to see something else? Yeah, sure. Wow! Where does it lead to? A smuggler's cave. [metallic rattling] -Are you sure this is safe? -Yes, but be careful. It's a bit wobbly. [water dripping] [Tim] How did you find this? [Perdita] I've been coming here since I was three. My dad showed me. It fills up at high tide, but it's OK, that's not for ages. -[Tim] It's very big. -[Perdita] Yeah. [Tim] Does anyone else come here? [Perdita] Only me. Witch's secret, see? It's better by candlelight. Got a match? Thanks. Can I keep these? Yeah. -What's through there? -The beach. Come on. [Perdita] Oh... These rocks are a bit dodgy, so... [Tim] Yeah, definitely. [gulls calling] What's he up to? Collecting birds' eggs, probably. That's against the law. Maybe that's why he's keeping tabs on Mr Smith. They're both up to something. I'm sure of it. Mr Smith just doesn't like people knowing his business. When people say that, they've got something to hide. -Any lobster? -No. -Find what you're looking for? -Aye. That's the first I've heard of peregrine falcons nesting in caves. Well, you learn something every day, don't you? Is there a way up the cliff? No, the only way back's the way we came. You go if you like, I want to stay and watch the waves. -OK, see you later. -See ya. Ah. A regular Steven Spielberg, eh? What have you got so far? [Tim] Just you and those men on the boat. Mind if I take a look? Ah, most impressive. Oh! Sorry. [man chuckles] It's alright, I've got you. It's probably broken. I'll buy you a new one. It's OK, it's fine. -Where's Mum? -Taking a nap. Mr Jones tried to break my camcorder. That's nice. And Birdy Smith's stealing eggs. Poor chap, he must be hungry. Rare birds' eggs. It's illegal, and they're worth loads of money, and I... -Not interrupting, am I? -No. We... had a bit of an accident with the camcorder, I'm afraid. So that's what Timmy was saying. If there's any problem, I'll happily buy a replacement. No. It's fine. I wish I knew more about art. Don't suppose you've got time for a beer? Why not? [Tim] I'm telling you, he tried to break my camcorder. You read too much detective nonsense. Ten minutes, then lights out. OK? Did you know the average burglar gives himself three minutes to rob a house. Any longer and the chances of him getting caught in the act double. [Helen sighs] Good night, Tim. I've told you, Perdita, he pays the bills, he makes the rules. He'd have a blue fit if he knew you were talking to strangers. Tim's not a stranger, he's my friend. Stay out of trouble. Lodgers don't grow on trees. -[door closes] -Mr Smith! Shh! Not a word! I just want to say good night. Isn't it about time you stopped calling me "Mr Smith"? -Do we have a choice? -Well, my name is Roger. Good night, Roger. Good night... little witch. -I saw you kissing him. -You most certainly did not! -In here, I saw you. -I can't help your silly ideas. He likes you though, doesn't he? And you like him. Will you stop matchmaking? There's nothing wrong with having a friend. It's someone you can share secrets with. And what secrets do you have, young lady? That's for me to know and you to wonder. [Annie] Hmm. -Sleep tight. -Good night. Good night. -Boo! -How did you get in here? Witch's secret. No, silly. I sneaked up the stairs. Look, I've brought you a present. I found it in the cave after you left. It could be precious, a diamond, probably, worth millions of pounds. Well, worth a toffee at least. [Tim] Diamonds come from Africa or India, and they don't look like this. They do before they've been cut. I saw it in a book. -Litterbug. -[Helen] Tim! -Who were you talking to? -Uh, just reading aloud. -Tim, where is the suitcase? -Why? I left my spare pair of trainers in there. -No, you didn't. -Oh. [Helen] Must have left them behind. Ah well, never mind. 'Night, luv. [Tim] Good night. [sighs] That was close. You'd better go. See you tomorrow. [door closes] Tim, come look out here. Rare bird's eggs probably. You don't know that for sure. That's why we have to find out. How? I'm off, see you. [dog barks] If that's a real diamond, I'm Leonardo da Vinci. It might have been dropped years ago by smugglers or pirates. -Pirates! -Larry, don't spoil it for him. Why get his hopes up? [like pirate] Tis but a piece of quartz, Tim lad! Oh, good morning. Perhaps we could have your opinion. Larry, no. Tim's convinced it's a diamond, I'd say it's quartz. -Where did you find this? -A friend gave it to me. I think your stepdad's right: quartz. I'll tell you what, though. I'll give you ten pound for it, just to make you feel better? Oh, no, no, really. No, thank you. I'm afraid he's rather spoilt. Twenty pound, then. No, thank you. Alright, last offer: 50 pound. Mr Jones, don't be absurd. Indulge me, dear lady. I have no children of my own. It gives me pleasure to spoil other people's. What do you say, Tim? Fifty pound. It's very kind of you, but I'll keep the stone. Ahh. Fair enough. Maybe it will turn out to be a treasure, like your painting. Am I allowed to ask how you're getting on? I gave it to Mr Tarbutt to keep in the safe. Bad move, Mr Hoggart: Jock can never remember the combination; he's got a memory like a sieve. Just you worry about their picnic hamper, woman. I'll give you a hand. I'll set up the painting in the lounge. [door rattles] Two by twelve left, three by seven right. Four by fifteen left, three by twenty-five right. Now. Four by fifteen to the left... three by twenty-five to the right... two by thirty.five left. That's it. What the...? Come here, you. I just want to see the boy. Tim. Listen, I just want you out of here, you little witch! Go on! Next time you'll feel the back of my hand! So... this is quite a discovery. Worth a lot of money? How can you put a price on genius? Oh, yeah. [Larry] It's cleaning up very nicely. You know, Jock, I'm beginning to feel distinctly hopeful about this. -Guess what? -What? Mr Jones offered me £50 for that stone. -So it might be a diamond. -I know. [Larry] You see, in many ways this is reminiscent of Monet, particularly the cliffs, the nuances of colour and shape... the sense of nature in fury. [Jock] Oh yes, absolutely. [Larry] You see, Jock, for the Impressionists, the quest was always towards the representation of the truth. With the tiniest hint at the colours of the natural world, the human experience was reproduced, not always exactly, I might add, but almost always with passion! You see what I mean about passion, Jock? Aye. Just take these figures that we're uncovering there. What's fascinating is how the figures imply a kind of dramatic narrative, instead of just being incidental accessories. Sorry, Tim's always telling me I'm good enough to bore for England on this wicket, aren't you, Tim? Tim? Timmy? What the hell...? What on earth?! Larry! Betty, fetch a doctor! What have I told you about polishing the floor?! I don't think he slipped. What happened to him? [helicopter blades whirring] Will he be OK? It's too early to tell. We'll do everything we can. -Good. -But we really have to go, now. Larry didn't slip, he was knocked out. Not now, Tim! Please! I'm sorry, but I can only take one passenger. He's just a kid! I can't leave him! -It's you or him, I'm afraid. -He has to come with me! Those are the rules. You want me to leave him on an island full of strangers? -Sorry. -Wait, just wait. Betty, can you look after Tim? There's no room in the copter. Of course, Helen, don't worry. Larry needs you with him now. -You'll be all right with me. -Yeah, of course. I'll phone as soon as I can. -It's now or never! -[Tim] Go on, Mom! I knew it! Mrs Tarbutt? -What's the matter? -The painting's been stolen, my room's been robbed, and I know who did it: Mr Jones. -Ah, is that a fact? -What are you doing with that? Putting it back where it belongs. I think you owe Mr Jones an apology, young man. -Sorry. -[Jones] That's alright. He's upset, aren't you? Ooh, look. Why don't you go buy yourself an ice cream? No, thanks. So you risked everything for a videotape? The kid had me on it, and you. -And what if the man dies? -Who cares? Tomorrow I'll be in Spain, with a jug of sangria in one hand and a señorita in the other. Oh, no you won't. You'll be here tomorrow, and the day after. There are only two ferries a week off this island. You pick a dump like this. When laying low, there aren't many places to choose from. -Fancy you bringing golf clubs. -[Jones] How was I to know? Besides, we can't all be as sophisticated as you. Birdy Smith, author and recluse. I hid my tracks until you came around knocking people about. As you know, if people get in my way, I knock 'em about. -That's a good one. -Give me that tape. [tape splashes] Right, I'm off. I don't know about Mr Jones, but Mr Smith's not a bad man. If he was, Annie would have nothing to do with him. So what were he and Mr Jones up to last night? What are you accusing him of? Nothing yet, but he's on my list of suspects, unless you can prove who he says he is. Alright, I'll prove it. I thought you weren't allowed in here. I'm not. It's definitely here, somewhere. See? He's just a nice man who writes about birds. This is where I used to sit. History's my favourite, and English, especially Shakespeare. Look. See? Author Birdy Smith, with some of her feathered friends. Your Mr Smith's an impostor. That doesn't prove he's done anything wrong. Or he's anything to do with Mr Jones. Why are you always protecting him? He pays rent; that's how we live. If he goes to prison, what would happen to me and Annie? Prison? So you do think he's suspicious. I don't know what to think. I wish you'd never come! [Tim] Perdita! [diamonds rattling] See you later. Three minutes. Ready, steady, go! [Perdita] Ahem! I thought I had at least another-- No one's allowed in here. He doesn't even let Annie in to clean. Perdita, the stone you found was definitely a diamond. He has lots of them. I was watching. -Who? -Jones! Look. He was in the school. He reached up on top of the bookcase and pulled down a pouch full of diamonds. So, you see, it's not birds' eggs after all. And I'll bet Mr Smith's got just as many diamonds for himself. Come on, help me look. -Mr Smith's not a bad man. -They're in it together. You saw them yourself. -They each had a pouch. -That doesn't prove anything. Why pretend to be Birdy Smith if he hasn't anything to hide? He just wants to be alone. Look, I've got Jones and the diamonds on tape. All I need now is to catch Jones and Smith together. [Perdita] Mr Smith's a good man. Tim, please. Will you go now, please? -I just want to be left alone. -[sighs] OK, I'll go. But I'll prove it, I will. [sighs] [Annie] Ready! Just a minute. What are you reading today? -Charles Dickens. -Very good. -Bye, then. -Bye. Bye. So, uh, what's all this about? [Smith] Um... [Annie] Something wrong with my cooking? [Smith] No, no. Really, I just thought it would make a change. Help! Tim! There's a word for people like you: nuisance! And there's a word for people like you: thief. I beg your pardon? Diamond thief, to be precise. I reckon you and Mr Smith stole them together. He's been lying low till the fuss died down. Now you've come for your share, and I've got the diamonds on videotape. [Tim screams] [camera splashes] A little bird told me your boat might be available for a trip to the mainland. Maybe. Help! [Campbell] Well, there we are. Sea's calm. We should make it in about two hours. So, Annie... have you ever thought of settling down? [explosion] Back as soon as I can. Where are you going? [explosion] -What is it? -Someone's in trouble. Come on! [gulls calling] [Tim] Help! [alarm sounding] What's the problem, boys? What is it, Perdita? What can you see? [Perdita] Tim! [rescuer] Stay there, boy, you'll be OK. OK. You're safe now. Turn around. OK, drop him down to us! Take it easy. There we are. Good boy, that's it. Throw me the line. Well done, little witch. [crowd murmuring] You're lucky nothing's broken. A fall like that could've killed you. I didn't fall, he pushed me. Now, that's a very serious accusation, son. [Jones] And it's not the first. I steal a painting, then I try and kill you. What are you gonna accuse me of next? You tried to sneak out of the hotel without paying, I saw you. -I followed you with my camera. -I was out for a stroll. That's all; besides, why would I check out of the hotel when I've got no intention of leaving? -Why did you have your luggage? -I didn't. And I saw you in the schoolhouse. What would a man my age be wanting in a schoolhouse? [Tim] You went to get the diamonds you'd hidden there. He's a jewel thief, and I've got the evidence on videotape. [bystander] It's ruined. [Jones] See? It's obvious what happened. He dropped the camera, then fell off the cliff trying to get it back. Now he blames me so he doesn't get into trouble for wasting these chaps' time. You shouldn't tell lies, lad. Truth will out. I'm not telling lies! [monitor beeping] -You sure you're all right? -Fine, honestly. No more adventures, OK? Just stay out of harm -till I get back. -When will that be? As soon as there's another ferry, I promise. Did Larry say what happened to him? No, no. He's still unconscious. Tim, are you sure you're alright? Yes, fine. OK. I love you lots. You too. I'll make sure he's all right, Mrs Hoggart. -Don't you worry. -Thank you, Betty. Bye. OK then, bye-bye. We came to see how you are, Tim. You, out! Jock Tarbutt, she saved the boy's life! This hotel is for guests. Perdita's my guest, Mr Tarbutt. Supper for three, please. Jock! Well, it's like I get a sort of tingling in my head, and then I see things with light shining all around them, much brighter than normal. And then I feel really really tired. I suppose you think it's silly. He doesn't now, do you, Tim? I'm just glad you did it. [Betty] There you go, dear. -Thank you. -What's this? She's never eaten out before, hardly been off the island. Well, you enjoy it. Oh, Perdita, that's your new dress. Go and wash it off. Sorry. You have to get off this island before someone gets killed. Don't blame me; I'd be long gone if it wasn't for that boy. Besides, I've decided it was an omen. I'm just not meant to leave without that painting. [Smith] You're crazy. [Jones] Wouldn't it be nice to work together one last time? [Smith] Read my lips. No. I'm not going to risk jail because you've turned greedy. Now you read my lips: you're gonna crack that safe, or your friend Annie is going to find out all about your exciting past, and who knows, some public-spirited sort might decide to send the police a postcard from Spain. [monitor beeping] Larry! -Larry! Can you hear me? -[Larry groaning] Oh, thank goodness. Nurse! Nurse! Are you all right? If you knew someone was going to do a bad thing and they'd get in trouble if they got caught, serious trouble, would you try and stop them? Well, I suppose it would depend how bad the thing was. Is there anything you want to tell me? No, just wondering. 'Night. Night-night. [Scottish dance music plays] [humming] [muffled dance music continues] [lock clicking] [whispering] This is the last I ever see of you, understand? Get me that painting and you'll never see my ugly mug again. [lock clicking] Someone else had the same idea? [bell rings] [dance music continues] Jock! So, how did you do it? I suppose you're going to tell me it's a witch's secret? Do you always talk in riddles? I found this toffee wrapper by the safe at the inn. I was there for supper last night, remember? Yes, but this must have been dropped after Mrs Tarbutt did the vacuuming, or she would have seen it. I heard the vacuum cleaner at 10:30, an hour after you left. Which means you must have come back later. I may be a litterbug, but I do not go around stealing paintings. Who said anything about the painting? Where is it? In your room? [Perdita] Tim! You've no right. Now, if I wanted to hide something, where would I put it: in the wardrobe? No, too obvious. Under the bed? No. But how about in the bed? There's two things I can't understand: one, how you knew the combination to the safe, and two, why you stole it. -You stole that? -I found it in the first place. Doesn't make it yours to keep. Tim, would you mind? I'm sorry, Perdita, I didn't mean to get you into trouble. We might as well start packing: the Island Council aren't gonna stand for stealing. I only did it for him. And he's not even who he says he is! So, who exactly are you? I had a small security firm. Business was bad, and I discovered that my partner had transferred all the debts into my name. I lost everything, went bankrupt. Then you start again. New business, no worries, transporting uncut diamonds. Which you decided to steal. I met Jones in a bar. I was drowning my sorrows. It was his idea. I knew my partner would be insured, so it seemed like a victimless crime. Have you any idea what Perdita's done for you? She stole the painting. Why? So you couldn't steal it, so you wouldn't get caught and go to jail. Why would she protect me? Because this last year, you're the nearest she's had to a father. Don't you see? You and me, we're all she's got. [gulls screeching] Perdita! [echoing] Billy, have you seen Campbell? He's gone to Carlin's Cave. The man paid him. The one with the golf clubs. Thank you. You've not got long. The tide's coming in fast. [Larry] No. So you say this man, Mr Jones, crept into your son's room? Yes. I went to look for Tim. I opened the door... and there was Mr Jones in Tim's room with an ashtray in his hand. Next thing I knew, I was waking up here. Wait a minute! What's he doing here? The ornithologist chappie, Birdy, Birdy Smith! [both] Birdy who? Perdita. [metallic rattling] Perdita, it's high tide. This place will flood in a minute. Then you'd better go, hadn't you? Look, I'm sorry I dropped you. It's all right, it would have happened anyway. -[oars clattering] -What's that? Shhh! Put those back! -You nosy brats. -They belong to Mr Smith. Oh. Oh. Now, that poses a very interesting question, doesn't it? 'Cause as he stole them in the first place, they don't belong to him, so I can't be stealing them, can I? We'll see what the police say about that. -Oh, will we, now? -[Perdita] Quick! Come here, you pair of... Come here, you... Hurry up! [ladder rattling] [metal clangs] Carefully. Come on, kids. I like children. [metal rattling] Ho! Ho ho. Gotcha. What was it you were saying about the police? [Perdita] Get off! Get down! [Jones] Do you mind? Alright! [retreating footsteps] Where's he gone? Come on. No way up and, oh dear, oh dear... [ladder clangs] no way down. You can't just leave us up here. Watch me. [chuckles] We'll have to drop down. That's too far. We'd break our legs. We'll shout then. Nobody comes here except me. Nobody would hear. -Help! -Help! [Perdita and Tim] Help! But Mr Jones is still here. He was on the cliff top yesterday when Tim fell. Well, he's the one who hit Larry. And Mr Smith is involved too, except his name isn't Birdy Smith, it's, uh, Roger Stanton. -Oh, no. -Tim is all right, isn't he? [both straining] It's just too hard. I believe you have something that belongs to me. Ah yeah, I was looking for you. Nice of you to get these for me. Would you believe there are certain gentlemen who might have done a runner with them? Can't trust no one these days, can you? How did he get here? We can try swimming out. And then what? There's no way up the cliff. -Someone might see us. -No, they can't. -We could try. -No! Look, it's your only choice. You can't swim, can you? Come on. [Smith] How much is he paying you? More than me, I guess, and that's all that counts with you, eh? Times are hard, Mr Smith. Aye. [helicopter approaching] Damn kids must have called the police before they went into the cave. What kids? The brat with the camera and the witch's daughter. -They were hiding behind rocks. -You left them there? Yeah. They're stuck in a shaft in the cave. They'll drown, but it's alright; it'll look like an accident. -Can't this thing go any faster? -Turn back. -Turn back. -Are you out of your mind? I'll not leave two children to drown. -Take the dinghy. -They'll be dead by the time I get there. Turn back! My boat, my rules. If you go back, you'll spend the next five years rotting in jail. Think about it. [Campbell] We'll phone for help when we get to the mainland. -It'll be OK. -It won't be OK. Listen. Yours. Just stop this boat. My fingers are numb. I can't hold on. -Yes, you can! -You go. What, and leave you here? No way! The tide can't go on rising forever. I suppose it's too much to expect you to wait. I'd like to help, but... Times are hard, I know. Hey. Just get me to the mainland. I'm scared. It's OK. [Perdita gasps] Perdita! Hold on. It's OK. You're alright. You're all right, just hold on. Hold on tight. You'll be all right. -You OK? -Yeah. Don't worry. Perdita! Tim! Perdita! Tim! Perdita! Tim! Tim! Perdita! It's no good. Perdita! Perdita! It's alright. I've got you. It's OK. We've got to go back down again. -I can't. -She can't swim. Yes, she can. I'm going to take you down the shaft and into the cave. All right? You have to take a deep breath and hold on. Hold on to me tight. Alright? You can do it, Tim? All right. One, two, three... Get her, Tim. -You'll be OK, little witch. -What will happen to you? Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. Go on. -Thanks, Tim. -Thank you. What's happened to you? For goodness' sake, you're soaking wet. Come on. Right, Mr Stanton. [officer] Your friend will be on the mainland by now, laughing his head off at you, probably. He's no friend of mine. Please, not in front of the girl. I'm sorry. Take care of yourself, eh? Don't be a fool. No! Down! Down! Have they found him? Perdita! So the only real evidence you had was on your camcorder? Yes. But wait! Jones knew you were on to him. So? So he'd never risk moving too far. He'd hide somewhere, wait till the fuss died down, then make a run for it. Ah yes, your mum told us about you and your theories. Why will no one ever take me seriously? -The boy may have a point, sir. -Maybe, but Jones will be on the mainland by now. It'll take us months to find him. Not necessarily. Kids. -Where's Perdita? -Asleep. -Leave her. -I'm sorry, but it's important. [Annie] Tim! What are you doing? What are you looking for? Stop! Wait! "Logan Arms Hotel"? Mr Jones had these when he arrived. My hunch is it's where he stayed on his way here so it might be where he is now. [police radio chatter] You have no right to arrest me! Oh, really? Try "aiding and abetting." [officer] You know what, Mr Jones, my heart bleeds for you. These stones must be worth a fortune, and you'll never see a penny of it. Now that's sad, very sad. There'll be plenty of other jobs for me when I get out. Oh, but you don't understand. After what you did to those kids, you're never getting out, never! [siren wails] Aunt Annie, the lobsters. I saw them, they're back. Come on. It's a miracle, the curse has been lifted! Perdita, they're enormous! Want one for dinner tonight? Yes, please. -I wish Mr Smith was here. -So do I. [happy chatter] Look, that's gonna taste really good. Thanks for your help looking after Tim, Betty. Oh, it was a pleasure. Oh! I'm just glad everything turned out fine. By the way, how's Larry? I think he's on the mend. Ooh, he's heard from the museum. They want to reward the person who found the painting. Oh, lucky Perdita. Here, Helen. I've got a wee souvenir for you. I'm sorry about what happened. [sighs] It wasn't your fault. You did what was right. I tried. -Perdita? -Yes. -I'd like you to have this. -But it was a gift to you. I'd like you to have it, to remember me. -I'll make you a deal. -What? If you come back to see me one day, maybe I'll accept it then. It's a deal. Tim! Come and look at this. Look. Come on, luv, we'll miss the ferry. Say goodbye to Betty. -Come back soon, Tim. -You bet. I know someone who's gonna miss you quite a lot. [Tim] Perdita? Perdita. [Smith] Don't be scared. [Perdita] Where were you? I thought if I made it look like I was dead, the police would stop searching for me. They do think you're dead, and they've got the diamonds, so why did you come back? I was cold, wet, tired... but most of all I was scared of being caught. That's no way to live. But why did you come back here, to me? I wanted to see you, and I want to see you go back to school, and I want to see you looked after and happy. It's not just me you came back for, is it? No. It's not just you. It's Annie. Perdita, there's something you have to understand. [Perdita] I'll try. I'm gonna go away for a while. To hide? No. I'm gonna do something I should have done a long time ago. I'm gonna turn myself in. Hopefully I won't be away too long, and... I'll come back, I promise.
