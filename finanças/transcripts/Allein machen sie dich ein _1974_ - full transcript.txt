Basically each one of us is alone, you know? Real friendship is actually hard to find. Because it's all made so frantic, isn't it? 'Cause of the whole machinery. It's functioning all together The whole entertainment industry... Music industry, clothings, and it's such a shit… And all profit from one another. Then it's pretended we are doing something together. You are controlled everywhere, obliged which music to hear, and everything as in the advertising. The cigarettes advertising, you know? All the youths want huge cars, cute chicks, all the same… So they're trying to pretend. It's a replacement, a replacement of problems, but no relaxing at all… So that you forget that on Monday you have to slog away. Those you are getting money from they get it back immediately from you. You get the money and you pay it back immediately. If you want to change something you are marked as having communist attitudes, that your thinking is red... Many people have prejudices. If somebody changes something, he wants only... to change so that in effect .. something improves. There are many people thinking you have red attitudes. It's a completely wrong opinion. I find that every worker every single worker, like me, you and everybody. They are always complaining but they shut the mouth because they have enough money to survive. If they don't earn money anymore, they would rebel more often, instead of thinking about it sitting on the toilet. How do you think you can change what you want to? What does it mean: "I want to change"? I cannot change anything. Maybe I live the day when the workers will go on the streets, not with flags but to complain and protest. Because they know that's going so bad... Now not looking at it politically, but merely... How could I say it? The disfunction... that they don't know a way out, that they would complain about it, and get organized as a mass. If you're alone they fuck you up. they sack you they laugh at you and when you act against it they lock you up in prison and all you can comment is: "That was a sledge- hammer, hey man." How did it all begin? The story of the squatting We still lived with our parents and we always met at night in the Wrangel youth centre. in Kreuzberg, in the Naunystrasse. We had a beer and chatted away about work, but nothing more than dancing, playing table tennis… There were a few fellows they had a theater group, and with them we thought if we could find us a space, to shape our leisure-time without any educator telling us what to do. So we looked around Kreuzberg and then we found on Mariannenplatz a 4 floors factory, which was empty and we squatted it. On July 3rd 1971, 300 youths squatted a vacant factory on Mariannenplatz. It was the 1st successful squat in Berlin. The youth centre was in horrible condition. It had been vacant for a long time. It was full of rubbish. We had to do a lot of things: electric installations, we built walls and so on… And we launched ourselves into that and we tried to renovate the building creating working groups: an apprentices' group and a schoolkids' one… Then came the problem that most of us still lived at home, but didn't want to anymore. They wanted to leave their homes and there was no way to live in the youth centre. So we tried to rent some place, but it didn't work at all. How can you get a flat when you are an apprentice, you earn 200 Mrks and you're not yet 18. You get no place, At the corner on the other side of Mariannenplatz there was the Bethanien hospital. Vacant since two years, nice rooms, and we said: this is the house for us! Bethanien was a former hospital, which was closed and was vacant. It was heated in Winter and used for nothing. The people of Kreuzberg got angry of that and said: "Why shouldn't people live there?" We took the former nurses' house. So many rooms… About 90. two big spaces, where each one of us could have his room, community rooms, and a kitchen. There was enough room to live. It wasn't a big block but not too small either, for a collective. So we gathered in the youth centre with different groups and we reasoned about what to do. As we squatted the youth centre with a big party we thought: "Let's open!" There was an occasion: Georg von Rauch was shot to death. There was a teach-in at the Uni. We distributed flyers and invoked squatting. The TU was crowded out, and then 600 people came to Mariannenplatz and helped us. About 100, 200 people entered the house, the rest stayed outside and didn't climb over the wall. The cops were already there, and forced the people apart, they drove in with cars and started beating. The people in the house felt good, they were glad. It was our house. Peace to the shacks, war to the palaces Hands off the Rauch Haus or there will be troubles! The City Councillor for Youth, Erwin Beck, came to negotiate with us. We said we wouldn't go, so he assured us that we could spend the night inside, until the negotiations would begin the next day. The negotiation resulted in a temporary contract for 6 weeks. The situation in Berlin was that the SPD tried to exhibit us to show they were making a youth-politics and tried to attribute to themselves the work we had done. So when the Rauch Haus was squatted for about 9 months the City Council said: in order not to be fucked up they forced us to sign a new user contract. It contained supervision like in the other asylums, we weren't allowed to choose our social workers anymore and we had to meet regularly with the City Council. Moreover we had the obligation to produce an annual report about what we do, with statistical data about who lives here how old the poeple are and things like that. Another condition was that the City Council could in any moment terminate if we wouldn't respect these points. That meant: kicked out without notice. So we decided not to sign the contract but to start a huge campaign. And we discussed what we could do. We had the good idea to inform the population first of all in Kreuzberg, then the young people in Berlin and in West Germany. If they kick us out, we are on the street. We have to find a home. Each one of us knows how difficult it is to get a flat, if you are young and you have long hairs. Best you have to be married or... I don't know what more. Searching for home is to find ourselves in a real horror, that's why we will try with every means to keep this house. We need many people. We'll make a demonstration where the bigger number of people should come, so that they see that the people support us. A vacant Bethanien and ever rising rents! Stand up against that! We want the City Council at the negotiation table! Then we thought about what also we could do, and we went to the youth centres to inform. We did also a teach-in in the Uni, with about 2000 people there, and then we went to the youth centres and we told them what our house actually is, and what our intentions are, but that the City Council always tries to block our work. Now as a conclusion, we want to issue a resolution, and we want you to vote for it. Those who are present support the demand of the Georg von Rauch Haus, about further negotiations with the City Council and with the Kreuzberg District Council. We are definitively against the closing and demand a new contract without supervision and controls and no eviction without notice. TU Audimax 7.12.72 DID SQUATTERS BUILD THE BOMBS? All the time we had lots of troubles with the police We got an awful lot of police raids at our place. At night they controlled people's identity cards. The press used the raids against us and tried to present us to the public as criminals and bums. Police discovered bomb-workshop Group dorms, protest songs, stinking kitchen & a cat So we made a newspaper. Every one in the house was involved in it. It was really nice and the people had fun. It had contributions from everyone living here. People said it was a good newspaper. We printed 10.000 copies. …no, 30.000. So we distribute it everywhere, in Berlin in Kreuzberg, we sent it also to West Germany, to the youth centres and we called for solidarity. Then we made another demonstration in Kreuzberg. "Hands off the Rauch Haus or there will be troubles!" The City Council broke the negotiation. then 3 days before the end of the contract they offered to enter the negotiation again. Then we all showed up and made some achievements. We got rid of the eviction without notice clause. Now we have a 5 months term. The "supervision paragraph" was reduced to only some cooperation issues. When the City Council wants to talk about "important things", we have to meet them. Concretely the points are: A) We need to know who is involved in this experiment. Which advisors are exercising their function in it. A member of parliament We have to make sure that the advise is ofessional from a socio-pedagogical qualification. In order to establish that this is really a socio-pedagogical work, and not... How can I say... …an overthrowing society work. So the City Council wanted to send us a couple of social workers with the very probable task to control us. We wanted to have social workers who we know who are friends, and we achieved that. They were important for the legalization of the "Trebeganger" (runaway kids) who came here. To speak with the parents and to deal with all the paperwork. It was also important that instead of sending delegates to the negotiations, we all went together. That made us much stronger and more confident. It helped hold up the pressure on these people. I mean the City Council. Concerning the contract we signed, there were still different opinions in the house. But in the end there was agreement that it was right to sign it and stay in the house. The Martha Maria house's tenants in Mariannenplatz were facing today the Youth and Family Commission of the Berlin City Parliament. The youngs refused to sign the existing contract which, in their opinion, leaves the authorities too much possibility of control... After revision, the contract was accepted by the tenants. That caused the critics of the CDU fraction: "We greet the effort to give a chance of integration to homeless youths, but we argue that the new contract prevents authorities from taking part in the decision making." Senator R. answered back: "With tolerance and cooperation, it's possible to overcome the youths' mistrust of the authorities' supervision." She knows anyway the contract brings some risks. If the youths don't respect the agreements, they would be warned 2 times and after 3 months, evicted. This ist our house, finally kick out Schmidt and Press and Mosch from Kreuzberg. The senator was pissed off, CDU was heavily indignated that the fellows now take what belongs to them anyway, but to show the world, how generous they are: "We will evict later, for now we let them stay." But the people in the Rauch Haus shout: "You will not get us out! This is our house finally kick out Schmidt and the Press and Mosch from Kreuzberg. And we shout out loud: "You will not get us out! At home I was the only girl and I lived with 2 brothers in one room As long as I remember, my parents were busy with their jobs. My mother too. So I did all the domestic work alone. I cleaned, and when they came home, I prepared lunch, I did the washing… So little time for myself. And you can imagine, 3 people in one room… always quarreling. And then I ran away from home. I've been 2 months on the run now. Then the Youth office put me in a flat share. As I couldn't stand it, I came to the Rauch Haus. My mother was often here and she found it really nice, clean and so on… My father is more complicated, he says little. But when he talks he blames Rauch Haus for his daughter not living at home anymore. I can't tell my parents that they are wrong. If I only speak for myself, I say: "It's right". Here I can be understood. Because here we are all interested in each other. It is different at home. There what father says is right. When they came home from work, they were always quite aggressive. Now I understand it. When you have 3 children... You have to work the whole day and then at night, you have 3 children at home. Of course it's stressful. I can see it differently now. One has to deal with a lot of people and try to live together well. When there are conflicts they have to be solved not alone, however, but all together. For example at the beginning we were very few girls. For a while after the squatting, there were much more boys. Of course you get tensions. You don't want to lose all the time. When you see something going the wrong way, you try to make it better. We got together and discussed, we went to each one and we talked about problems we had with each other. And now it's going better, not with everyone, but to some extent it's better. We are 20 girls and 20 boys, so things have changed… Girls and boys have an equal say. So you received money from the City Council. What did the City Council want from you? Each cent you receive from the City Council … you don't know what to do with it, but you are being bought. He gave an example from Köln: with money they can take down many people. They don't care anymore. Tell them concretely how it was with us. Ok, we received 25.000 Mrk vouchers from the City Council We had as much food as we wanted We could buy clothes for a month. The efforts we made at the beginning to go to work, to get self-organized, to think… We had everything there, and nothing was ever cooked. We slept until 2 o'clock and stay up all night. Nobody went looking for job as far as the money of the City Council was there. And then they began to put conditions about the contract. Then it was about paragraphs... So we said: "No, we don't want money anymore!" And that's when self-organization started. We said: we don't want to be a youth asylum, we want to live instead like in a big flat share. We decided everyone had to contribute money for food, The workers giving more than schoolkids and apprentices. Those who earn more help the ones who earn less or not at all. Example: a worker gives 200 DM of 800, an apprentice 50 DM of 300 a schoolkid 20 DM of 200 Do you have an extra group which organizes all that? We don't have an extra group. With the money we do it this way: we nominate an economy commission composed of 2 people. They manage the money, they collect it, and then they are exchanged every 2 months by 2 new people. The ones who have kitchen service they go to these people and take the money to buy things. They have to cook for all, and then also do the dishes and clean the kitchen. And there are 3 people cooking every day, and they always change, until it was everybody's turn. So your turn comes every 2 or 3 weeks. It's an incredible benefit. When you live alone you have to cook and clean every single day. At morning, the people who go to work make breakfast, and the schoolkids have also breakfast together And at evening we have dinner together too. How many people sleep in a room? It is like living in big flat. Each has his own room. where he keeps his stuff Let's say: somebody is committed to a youth asylum, he could stay there, but he doesn't like it, … with the other people. So he comes here to you. - Tuesday and Thursday we have a plenum, where we all meet. The most difficult is the admission: when somebody comes who has no place to sleep, no job and then we have to reflect all together with him if we could cope with it. I learn in a professional school… In April I begin a course …either Tv technician or Telecommunications. You have to realize that many people here are older than you. I'm just telling you that there could be conflicts. And that perhaps you don't get along with us. That in the long term you could get sick of it. It's difficult, not much free time anymore, 'cause you have to deal with 40 people in the house… - What did you do last year? I learned as a painter, but I had to quit. Do you have job papers? - I have them at home. Why did you quit? - I had rashes. - He had allergy. How long did you learn? - 3 Months… And 3 weeks ago I ran away from home, 'cause it made me so sick… With all that orders. So in the last times I stayed at my friend's place but afterwards his parents came and suggested me to come here, and ask if I could live here. - How old are you? - 16. - So he has to go to school. - No, he works. Tell us what was the matter with your folks. Normally it builds up, and then something happens that makes you run away. My father beat me, and besides I was always given orders. To go to the toilet, I had to ask before. If I wanted to go to party: "No, you have to be at home by 7 or 8." - Are you from Berlin? - Yes. - From which district? - From Wedding I'm against accepting him. He comes here, stays for 3 days, tells his story, and then some people say: "I'm not against". But before people say: "We need more time to know him." We cannot accept people so easily That could be another flop... It's a big contradiction. Somebody who's decided to enter an apprenticeship, is easier to accept. You are less likely to be bombed with problems, as with a schoolkid who doesn't want to go to school. Or you accept someone who has been one year roaming around. He lost a regular rhythm in his life. Then you have much more problems with such a person. Do you understand? There are differences. If we can be with someone for a week, and talk with them, the way we can get an impression of them... In one week it's possible to get to know a bit each other. This way we give him a chance. If it doesn't work we can say: "This or that sucks, and you cannot stay here." - I think this is wrong. We have to say yes or no. If after one week you say: "No, you'll not be accepted." Then he has the same problem as before. - I'm glad to get a chance to put myself in your shoes, and to imagine if I can fit in. So you agree with this test week, don't you? The problem was that some schoolkids didn't go to school. Every 3 weeks we discuss the schoolkids issue… Every 3 weeks we decide we have to do something, to make them go to school. - On one hand we think that not going to work for 6 months is a learning process. Roswitha, Olaf and the others should have learned by now, that it only works with school… The rest is all our misinterpretation. In the end we just support their… slacking. This hard-boiledness! They've been here for one year and we argue: "Ah, we can't put those little kids on the street!" That's complete mockery! That's flat-out liberalism from our side. As consistent as we are with others. You have to start from the learning process and they should have checked it by now. - But they haven't. They are here since one year, they stayed really so… They got no qualification …and they know why they go to school. ... the others don't. About the workers we discussed for one year, about the schoolkids we've been speaking since 3 months, and since 3 days we make breakfast for them. For 2 days they got up and went to school, one day they didn't And now we give up? I think we need to go on now Then we chase them out of bed with cold water… - The last two weeks I had to wake them up so often… - Alright, then I'll do it next week… The schoolkids go out later than people who go to work, and these come home later than the schoolkids. So it is incredibly difficult to control if the schoolkids go to school or not. We have to solve it, so that the schoolkids control each other, like the workers do, too. - Schoolkids' groups: they get up together, and have breakfast together. Same as the workers. Breakfast, and by 6.30 or 7 they are gone. We could make them wake up and have breakfast together too. The school problem, or the schoolkids problem is about reciprocity. School and schoolkids. The schoolkid gets pressure from the teachers and the school. Here they are not oppressed. At school they are, so they think: "Why should I have to go there to be oppressed? I don't go there at all". That's how I see. As we can't solve the job conflicts at the Rauch Haus, the school-kids can't either. While we fight our problems at work, most schoolkids are not yet able to do that. They are too young, some have been in youth asylums, and lived on the street before. They are unhappy at school, but instead of struggling they withdraw. Our problem with the schoolkids can only be solved if the Scoolkids start organizing with other schoolkids, to stand up for their own interests. I have been here once half year ago and it was far worse than now, now some rooms have been tidied up and they look far better. - It's ok for you that the young people squatted the house? - That's actually their business… So, what should I say… A house has not to stay vacant. Of course a house has to be used. It's a harmless thing. And in a further view, that interests nobody. The hospital has been out of use, and since then… For us it doesn't matter what happens to it it's none of our business, and it's really simplier as simple citizens not to take care of it. Who now is coming in or not... We had only an insight into the whole thing. I can say it openly... We were disgusted by the dirt which reigned everywhere. If there would have been a little bit tidier from the beginning on, it wouldn't become so extreme. If the building stay vacant, it's a waste of our taxes, then every individual should look after it that the building are of use. - It should be… but the common citizen has no time for that. Basically he doesn't care. But it's his fault. When he gets his wage packet, he takes care of his money. - Right…but he will care very seldom of what's after… He delegates all to the authority. They will care… I know my son goes to the Rauch Haus almost every night. I know exactly where he is hanging around. You see that those youths at least they stand on their own feet. They go to work, they go to school, they cook for themselves… If Freddie would come here and say: "Mama, I don't like to live at home anymore" Now comes my counter question: "Where are you going to?" If he wouldn't know it, then maybe I would say: What about the Rauch Haus? Would you move in? And he would say: Yes. Then I wouldn't lay stones in his way. He could move there. Naturally I would go there to have a conversation with that people. And I would tell the people: "My son would like to live with you, will you let him?" I would get informations about how it is, and as far as I know, I find the Rauch Haus ok. - They help you just like a friend in the street would do, or even more. Youth centre, there are very few of them honestly, there could be a couple more… Most of the youth centres are so overcrowded, that there's nothing left. - The outh centre shouldn't be managed simply by employees of the City Council… …so small-minded, without imagination. What's the matter wit the City Council? The matter is that one from the City Council makes more shit than all the young people together. The time comes when the young people will have the same idea, to overthrow the things they want to, but they can't alone… We'd have to be a couple more. When you try alone, you fail again and again. When all the young people would struggle together, all in one fist, then you can believe me, that the world will change. - One alone will never do it but some can do something. We all had issues at home we couldn't solve. We couldn't because those issues belong to this society And we, here inside, with a couple of fellows we took away problems from society. We gathered together and now we care that little fellows get integrated. We clean together our shitters, but actually we aren't changing anything, except for 50 people. We were educated in authoritarian parents' houses where one decides what's to do, and duties are distributed and it has to be so, just like in the asylum. And now we opposed to that the self-organization. We started with big troubles 'cause nobody learnt it before. I found important that we reflect: we've not only the Rauch Haus in self- organization, but also the younth centre. We have to ask: "Self-organization: what for?" If you setup a printshop, you have to know what to print. A bar, for sure is delight, and you can go on... But you have to know for what, otherwise it doesn't work. That's a problem also in West Germany and everywhere. Squatting houses is not good in itself, then you have to do stuff… They sit in their self-managed youth centre, and nothing is working, because it's important not to take self-organization as a goal in itself. It has to be connected with the struggle against this society. The reason why our self- organization worked, to some extent, is that we had to struggle 'cause our living conditions were threatened. The problem with the self-organization is that you deal at the beginning with reform things. You relieve tasks of the State: for example the young people are on the street, so we create a youth centre. ... and the streetgames: when we built games for children, like climbing frames and so on… We have to learn now how to go beyond. At first it helps to move forward, it's quite natural that we are helping ourselves and we did, but also that now we have to convert that experience. The challenge is to connect the free time with the struggle against all those things we experience during all the day at work, and so… Our printshop can be useful for that. It would make the free time productive, and much more fun too. It's a matter of consciousness to join the struggle We are not doing it in the moment. Only few people do it, those who work and realized that it's going along with the struggle at work. The 8 hours at work, it sounds now foolish, but they can make fun too. When you had in fact a good conversation with your workmates and you found that the workmates have your same opinions, and that you can do something together: then I cannot say "I am exhausted by the work". Sometimes I come home from work, in a very good mood. What's also a problem here at home, just among us, I don't know if it's so everywhere… If you really go to a workers' group meeting other people, who like rather to chill.. They say "Do you have a meeting again?". They assume that it is like a penalization, when it's clear that going to a meeting could make fun, where you think together how to move forward. - The next step would be to organize ourselves somehow and struggle on. we have to deliver that free time is not enough: now we are at the point when we see that self-organization in itself doesn't bring us forward... For sure is a good approach, but we have absolutely to go further. Hundreds or thousands of people slowly get buzzing in their ears, but they will say: "It's not very much". But thousands are not chicken feed. And what's not happened yet, can happen. We can very quickly become many. After the squatting there were many people in the house who didn't want to have nothing to do with work. They said: "Why do you go to work?" "You will be only exploited". And we answered: "We are 50 people at home and primarily we have to get united". We observed that the people who are working all the day, they are exhausted, and that here it's not only a place where you can live differently. - How can we understand each other if one goes to work and the other hangs around all the day at home. And one has to bring bread also for the other who doesn't go to work. I can't understand it… You go to work or you don't, and you can say; "Well, I don't go to work". We understand it, but again: "What are you living from?" And a couple of people said: "We go together to the factory". And then it was like that: we were 8 people, working in a big factory not far from here. We woke up together every day at 5. It's nice when you wake up at morning, and you are not alone, but with 20 other people. It's different if you have to sell yourself alone or you do it with 8, 10 or 20 other people. We started to work there during the pay talks when the company was simply firing people, the unqualified, the labourers, in order to intimidate the people about loosing their jobs so that they wouldn't strike, or think actions to achieve more from the pay talks. As we were mostly labourers, after 2-3 months we have been dismissed, one after another. Even if you don't want to be exploited if you really want to change it, you have to work as long as possible in the factory, to be able to do something with the workmates. Many of us started with an apprenticeship then we are about 15 apprentices at home. - Who is unenployed? - I am! I think we should give him a term. He's been in the house since a really long time. We tried to get the paper from his parents but it didn't work. He himself showed no committment at all, to get the work papers, and I find that he'd have to get a bit of pressure. We have to set a limit but in his case it's extremely difficult to collect the papers and to find a job. - He has to make a weekly report about what he did. And what did he do in order to improve by himself. I think we should make so that the people who live around, every day ask what's about him at the moment. I see that it was discussed at plenum then was delayed until the next plenum and really important things were somehow misled. I find better that the people who are with him ask even more often… Or other people going to look for a job, they could ask him: "What's about you?" - To give a term seems wrong to me. - I come back to the weekly report. Ringo! … He just said: "a weekly report" Exactly! From all the unenployed. - I 'm against! - … And why? - Respect the turns, Gunther! I would like to say something to Hansi. It repeats itself again and again, it repeated already itself 6 or 7 times… Let's vote about it now. … A weekly report for the unenployed. So, who's for, that the unenployed or the ones who are sick, every week give a report to the plenum about where did they look and apply for job, how is it gone and what did they do in the house: if they cleaned, or repaired something? So that we have something at hand we can talk every week about. Who is in favour? Are we more or less all in favour? Who's against? - I am. - And why that? I cannot explain it. - Who abstains? I was against… I said it already before. Let me deliver it clearly. We said: "So, you can do more or less in this way: we repair something …" Then on the other hand they have to give a report at the end of the week, without giving any advice. The thing can be organized, we had already started with that. We know in advance how many people there are, who have nothing to do, and who have actually the time. The unenployed who hang around and come here they start slowly to be lazy. - Watch out, I think here you are mixing things up Now we just decided that they have to do something, and that they have to report. Let me speak! And the next question is what we decided last week when we found out those who are unemployed, we offered support and did a plan too. They make the window panes all over the house: the common room, the window panes, and so on. You'd have to pay attention and listen. But you can't come now when we take this decision collectively, saying they have to do this and this... It doesn't make sense to oblige unenployed people to fix toilets you don't. know if they'll be broken next year. We have to decide each plenum what has to be done. We can't put everything in the same pot. - Or you break a door… In the time when I was on the youth centre I let me convince by the owner of a petrol station to begin an apprentice as filling station attendant. Attendant is so a superfluous job. It is pure service: cleaning the glass pane and things like that. There are also still people, who stand in front of a hotel and open the door 8 hour per day. What's that? Attendant is still a bit better but somehow similar. I see that the attendant's job is not important at all, in order to change something. The changes can only be done starting from the things society depends on. And that is the workforce, the factories and the big companies. The aim has to be to develop solidarity among the workers in the factories For instance, at the petrol station it's a shit, I'm alone there, without contact with workmates. There's also a trade union group but they are 6 people, out of 500 filling station attendants. That means for me that I will not work at the petrol station forever. I want to learn as mechanic. At work we realized, that a lot of things that we complain: about capitalism and exploitation... that we didn't know exactly at all how this things are linked up. That's why we put ourselves together at home and we did a training. It's not so. We aren't the first who began to struggle against exploitation. We are not the first who are unsatisfied. We realized it also on our training the fight against oppression and exploitation took place since humans made other humans working for them. The history of our society is the history of the class struggle. The oppressed have always rised up against their bosses fighting for their liberation. Slaves fought for their freedom The villains rose up against the feudal bosses Peasants struggled against the big landowners The burgeoisie liberate itself from the aristocracy The workers fight against the capitalists The dominants compared to the other people were always a small minority which could hold up its power only because of having the army behind itself. Because the church was on its side, and because they made laws according to their interests. The whole state apparatus was created to hold up their power Thereby they could often repress the resistence of the people defeating it with brutal violence. When the people united, they achieved the victory. An example was the french revolution. After the revolution, the bourgeoisie took the power. They pushed on the development of technology and the capitalist mode of production. Thereby arose two new classes: the capitalists and the workers Millions of workers create by means of their work the wealth which only few appropriate. The workers cannot decide about how and what is produced. They are dependent on the few who own the factories. To make a living, the workers have to sell their workforce every day. For any improvement of their life and working conditions they had to fight. At the end of the '20s, several million workers were organized in the KPD, because they realized they could change their own condition, only changing the whole society from the roots. That means only if they seize the political power. During strikes and demonstrations the social democratic government made shoot against the workers on struggle. The Capital, with the help of the Fascism finally succeeded to smash the workers movement the communists were persecuted and closed in KZ. The contradiction between capital and work last for sure until today too. The workers' struggle against the deterioration of their life and working conditions. The social democrats want to acnowledge that capitalism needs to be only a bit meliorated and that it's possible for everybody to live in welfare. That's how they could mislead many of our workmates, and keep them out of the struggle. In spite of that the workers struggle against the oppression. We can see it with the strikes in West germany, Italy France, England… everywhere the workers struggle against the injustice and fight for their rights. What could we do in the factory? … and alone? No-one of us is somehow in an organization, we are all in the Rauch Haus but we have no support. We are not organized in the factory We are awfully defenseless if we want to go against something... This has happened to me with Krupp: I had two times a conflict with the boss so that, we almost got into a fight, and here it comes: now I find myself suddenly on the street. Suddenly I am a lonely dog. A bloody bastard on the street. Among the people is far too little the existing consciousness and experience of struggle. Which possibilities we have to defend ourselves. We have to gather experiences. Struggle experience as well... so that afterwards we could bild a party or an organization in which we fight. If I realize today, that's necessary to struggle organized then I have to start today. I can't leave it to any hazard, that the moment will come when it happens. In the country where we live, we are some millions. When we get united at last, there will blow another wind. So they will not laugh anymore, they will slip away to the Bahamas or into Ticino, the devil knows best where. And you know that it will happen, when we organize ourselves.
