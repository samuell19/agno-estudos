The Unfrocked One Boys, have you slept so far? Come on, fast! Faster! Move on! I want everything clean before the Mass. Excuse me. We won't need the heating any more. Don't you believe in the Allied advance? An assault to the Army morale! Four days! Oh, Mr. Morand! Listen, Morand. Keep your sarcasm for yourself. You see, it's a privilege to have orderlies here. For us, colonel, this is better than pealing potatoes! What's the matter with you this morning? Why did you leave your ivory tower? One can't work in peace any longer here with the preparation for your Sunday comedy. We're ready, Father. You should have stayed in bed, Fr. Mascle. It was unwise to get up in your condition. No, today it's Sunday. You think I ought remind Fr. Mascle that he's an officer and I can send him back? If this were the last Mass I celebrate with you, I'd be ashamed to lose it for a small fever. And Morand, Father? I hate to ask you to leave. Don't worry, Mascle. I'll leave you the place. So? You never saw anybody dressed so well? Here I am! No moths here and no mothballs! The food? - Disgusting. - It doesn't look so. I eat everything: I was a butcher's boy. I got a cast-iron stomach there. I'm here as an orderly. - An orderly? I and some others. There's also a priest, Fr. Mascle. He's the camp chaplain. How long have you been a prisoner here? - About five years. And you, sir? Three months, but I was in the hospital in Lubeck. I was caught as a fool near Colmar. What kind of people are in there? - Well, they're officers. First service! What you like a rug, friend? It's not expensive. Excuse me. Hey, a north-African! - Hey, a worker. This place is taken. That is fine. Listen, young man, didn't they teach you to introduce yourself to your superiors? Now it's perfect! To come here playing soldiers for 5 years as if we weren't all prisoners! Attention, to mess, confined for 30 days, stand up straight, fall out. So much fun! Silence him, colonel. - I fought not to be silent and will stop when I want to! Gérard Lacassagne, 2nd lieutenant of the 2nd Armored Division. Have you ever heard of the 2nd Armored Division? 2nd lieutenant Lacassagne, respect for the freedom of others.. calls for the leaving during the ceremony of those who don't want to assist. I inform you.. the prayers of the reformed cult are read by one of our comrades in barrack 8. And the movie? - This afternoon at 16:00 sharp. Thank you, colonel, major, captain? General? - Nothing of that: a 2nd lieutenant like you. Finally an indignant young man! We missed one in our collection. We already had an asthmatic colonel, heart-sick majors, dyspeptic captains, but never indignant 2nd lieutenants. You're not one of them? - You don't grow indignant at 45. Indignation is about arteries, you see. I don't think so: it's just temperament. Where's the infirmary? - I'm going there. - You too with asthma, ulcer, dyspepsia? No, I look for peace. They don't celebrate Mass on Sunday there. You smell the ether, of course. But ether is less inconvenient than lies, you know? How about being on first-name terms? We are equal in rank. So we'll call each other "old boy" and talk about victories and defeats. Maurice Morand, history professor at the Cairo Lyceum. Gérard Lacassagne, I failed the final exam because of history, professor! It's impossible! How can one fail in history? You must have had bad teachers. - If you say so. O God,  who, in creating human nature, didst wonderfully dignify it, and still more wonderfully.. - Father! restore it.. - You are sick, we must interrupt Holy Mass! grant that, by the Mystery of this water.. and wine.. Let's see what you have in your jack-in-the-box. Take courage now. - I'm not afraid. How it stinks! If you smoke close to the ether, you'll make us all blow up! What did they give you in Lubeck? Sulfonamide? It doesn't seems so. I don't know, I was stunned. Did they take x-rays after the operation? - I don't know and I don't care anyway. These words are haughty but they're not good as an answer. Here we don't appreciate haughty words. What do we appreciate, Lapeiran? Bordolaise chicken! This is the best I've heard today! You're not laughing? Do you have anything else to make our hero laugh? - Leave him alone. Well, here's my last question, Lacassagne, don't answer, if it embarrasses you, but we want to know with whom we're dealing: Why wouldn't you attend Mass? For many reasons. FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL TESTAMENT, THE MYSTERY OF FAITH; WHICH SHALL BE SHED FOR YOU AND FOR MANY UNTO THE REMISSION OF SINS. I expected this! We need a doctor. - No we need to take him to the infirmary. The ferryman to Spain sold us and they caught us. What a vile market in Algiers! I will never forget the freed cities! Never! Women sold themselves for a packet of Chesterfields, children under the rubble, and jazz music in the background. And unfailingly in the two camps, a swarm of priests to bless everything and to sing Te Deum over the cities destroyed. You'll forget. One forgets everything. No! - Oh yes! Within a month. Do you know a priest? - Yes. Then confide in him, you'll be comforted and move on as nothing had happened. No! Then, I'm sure you have a girlfriend waiting for you. Also this helps us live. Who do you take me for, sir? But weren't we on first-name terms? - Will you leave him alone? I never saw you poking your nose into other people's business. What's the matter? There, go there! I was certain! I told him so! But he's stubborn! Put him there! Now go, go! You can do nothing for him. And neither can I! No, you stay. I must give you an injection. Good God! Good God! Good God! Good God! Good God! Good God! Finally! Has Fr. Mascle come to his senses? The Mass will continue, won't it? Sorry to disappoint you but the meeting is suspended! Morand, I beg you! - I beg you of what? Of not saying that Mascle is a victim of yours? That, if he kicks the bucket, it's your fault? You're all intoxicated from imposture! As the Chinese from opium! If he had not come of his own will, you would've dragged him out of his bed! Silence! Don't talk of things you don't know! I know Christ, Christ alone: Him! But not the lies they pronounced in His name in 20 centuries of betrayal, starting from Saul of Tarsus all the way to Paul Claudel! Remember we are in church! Oh, because of that! But what's on this table? A piece of bread and a cup of wine. Relax! I won't touch them! And I haven't drunk good wine in 5 years! Fr. Mascle is extremely ill. I fear he won't make it. I'd like to have.. a priest. You know well there aren't other priests beside you in the camp. Death is hurrying, I want a priest immediately. Fear not, Father! You have no sins to confess. Nobody is without sin: priests need priests too. Go immediately. Outside? To the village? I don't know one in the whole region. The last bombardment killed the village curate. Listen: in barrack 6, there is a Catholic priest. He left Holy Orders, but this changes nothing. At 6? Are you sure? Yes. Tell us his name. No, I can't. It's a secret between God and him. If he doesn't want to come, he's free not to come. Tell him only this: Sacerdos in aeternum, and that I called him. That I called him. The soup! The soup! Not now, old boy, not now! I'll come later. Thank you, Schmidt. Gentlemen, by going outside to eat the Huguenot really taught us a lesson. It's indecent to eat in the presence of the Most Holy Sacrament. And why hurry so much? We know Fr. Mascle well: he'll complete Holy Mass. Anyway, since we have to receive Communion, we'll fast. It would be unforgivable not wait for his return, and that won't get cold. Gentlemen! Recollection exercise. Some discretion, young man! Fr. Mascle is dying. He's just revealed to me that among you, in this barrack, there is a priest. He appeals to the piety and charity of him who is still a priest among you, who may help him in his last moments. Did he say his name? He said that the priest is free not to go. Fr. Mascle also said: sacerdos in aeternum. Sacerdos in aeternum means that he who is a priest is forever so. So? Fr. Mascle is raving. If there were a priest among us, a defrocked one, after 4 years spent together, we'd know that. If however he's hiding in the shade, it's evident that the cause of his desertion is unworthy, shameful! I'm going. A man who only showed sarcasm towards our faith. You'll give me my due that I never liked Morand. Of that man we know what he told us: a professor of history in Cairo. - A scholar. In any case, I think quarantine is a must for the remaining weeks spent together. True? - Gentlemen! As senior member of the camp, I can't approve nor disapprove your initiative. I'll remind you, that we must remain solidly united before our warders' eyes. He lied to us! - Wretched unfrocked one! Morand? - Yes! I knew you would come. - I came for you, for me, but for nothing else. There were never lies between us. We won't start now. Collecting the Blood and Body of Christ falls to you, Morand, who are a priest. I can't give Communion. Nobody, no force in the world! Believe me! Don't hold it against me, Fr. Mascle. - I understand. Then on my behalf, authorize the people who were approaching for Communion to do it under both species. Will you say it, Morand? Yes, for you. Give me absolution. - No! Yes, Morand. Who else could? Mascle! Mascle! Did you absolve me, Morand? - I cannot absolve you, and there's no need to absolve you. Hurry up, Morand! Your life, your dedication! Your unceasing work here for 5 years! God is not so severe. But when He sees that I didn't lead back to Him a certain Maurice Morand, whom He tenderly loves and has great pity for, what shall I say to Him in my defense? Hurry up! Thank you, Mascle, for you patience, for your discretion, for your silence. Thanks! No thanking, Morand. The absolution! The absolution. I absolve thee from thy sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Mascle is dead. The loss of our chaplain is irreparable. His example will remain engraved in our memory. A rare example of goodness and charity, which we will try to follow. As for you Morand, you'll understand that after the revelation we received, no officer in the camp will ever speak a word to you. I'll never hear you, you won't speak: an excellent idea. Thank you, gentlemen! Morand, allow me to express my fraternal sympathy. We Protestants know very well the sectarianism of the Roman Church. It is almost 300 years.. - Please don't try to entice me, Schimdt! Jesuits or Huguenots, you're all the same. You're of the same mold! You and your churches! What courage! - Aren't you afraid to catch the plague by talking to me? The courage you've just had is something that.. Ah, forgive me if I break your quarantine right away: but I have message of Mascle for you. The last one. Let one of you give Communion, under both species, the Host and the Wine. You've been authorized. Enjoy! No! One who has a bad conscience must not take Communion! You sinned against charity! Who are you to judge? - Let it be, come on! If you insist I'll fling up all in the air! What are you waiting for? You do it! No! Well then! I'm for it! I want to do it for Mascle. Yes, I owe it to him. My wife ran away with somebody. I wanted to kill her when I returned. But one morning, while I was cleaning with him, because Mascle would clean the barracks with me, he opened my eyes, he made me understand. When I return home, I won't kill my wife. I'll forgive her. I confided to Mascle, who today would have given me Communion, as a prize. I don't do it because he's dead. He'd like that. Enough! Give me Communion! Well! What are you waiting for? Help yourself! The priest breaks the Host. My boy, you'll have to give thanks. My thanks? I'll do it while thinking of Mascle. Certainly not while staying here. Mascle was good. He was my friend. The priest pours water into the chalice and drinks. The priest cleanses the chalice with the purificator. Yesterday 12,000 of them arrived at Burgend. - Yes, a true air lift! They take them by truck to the station.. - Canon Jusseaume. Jusseaume. - Poor devils! Let's work now. Come in, please. Look, Father, you took the wrong umbrella! No, my friend: your boss will be happy to give me this umbrella. Oh no, Albert! You won't take advantage of each visit to take away an umbrella? It's an obsession! Last time I was cheated. You cheated me: synthetic silk, unworthy of a Satrap like you! This is beautiful! Do you dare to take it back? No, keep it.. with the others! - Thanks! But wish me good morning at least! So rude! Ill bred Satrap, insolent plutocrat, first-class pharisee! I greet you, authoritative teacher, illustrious ecclesiastic, and silk umbrellas collector! Tell me, to what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you? - Guess! Do you want more money for your seminary? - No. You have a protege to settle down? You want me to believe that this time it's a courtesy call? It's about Morand. It's impossible to be wrong. - Indeed it's so. Morand! These darn papers! Have you filled yours? - Yes. But there's a question they don't ask any more. What? - What religion. They don't do it on the way back, only on the way there, to know how to bury you. That's too bad. I'd have liked to answer this time. Really? - Yes, I'd have written Catholic. What? - Catholic! Not learned, not yet practicing, but Apostolic and Roman. You don't look surprised. By no means. If you looked for a reaction, well, I'm sorry. Come on, you there! He's over there! Of course Gérard will come last. My little brother is always late. Next! Civilian occupation? He's a seminarian. Is it an occupation? Well, I think so. Then I'll write ecclesiastic. - Yes! Well done! Next! Civilian occupation? - Engineer. To a priest! Did you know it? For a month. Vocation is like syphilis. One feels it coming. Go quarrel somewhere else, you two! Move ahead! Don't bother us! You've known me for two months and learned nothing! On the contrary: for me it's all clear and simple. It's not that I'm so clever, Maurice, but before me I only see.. What are you doing? Will you move on? - Move ahead, if you care! From whom does this intuition come? - From you. From me? - Yes, from you. I saw with what courage you faced stupidity and malice. Courage? - Yes, when in the barrack you went to Mascle. Anybody would have done that! - No. That wasn't a man's courage, it was a priest's courage. What are you babbling? I had pity for Mascle! No, pity had nothing to do with it. A man can console, only a priest can absolve. For an instant your returned a priest. Well, I owe it to you. No, that's not true! And stop looking for someone responsible. Thanks to you I'll be a priest: to save you! - Thanks for the gift. Keep it. So, are you putting down roots? - Shit! You must forget me. You must not think of me. - I refuse. I forbid you to pray for me. - I refuse. Dad, I'm here! But, dad, Édouard, there's nobody left. Shall we ask? Will you come, Catherine? Gérard! - Where is he? It's he! Those are my folks! Go and tell them the good news. They'll jump for joy and cry for happiness! Maurice! - Go! Tell them! Gérard! Hello, Gérard. - Hello, Catherine. You're tired. Let's go home. What are you saying, Odile? He looks great. I agree with Édouard. Yes, you look good to me too. Morand! The Satrap! What are you doing here? Are you waiting for somebody? - You? My mother! Has something happened to her? No, she's fine. She's at home in Pontoise. I didn't send her a telegram. How did she learn of my arrival? She knows nothing of it. So it was you who.. You don't want me to believe.. that you've been at the station for 15 days watching for my arrival! No, I arrived about half an hour ago. Is it really for me that you're here? - Yes. Who sent you? - The professor. Ah! It's one of his tricks! I should have guessed! And where is he now? First I want to hug him and then properly insult him. In his seminary. What do you want? Hotels in Paris are all full and there are no more trains to Pontoise. I offer you a bath, a good dinner, and a bedroom in my house. Thanks! What bliss! I had forgotten such things! This is pure silk for a Satrap. Ah! Your children have grown up. Yes, they're in the countryside with their mother. They're beautiful. I envy you. When people think of priests, they think only of the deprivation of.. of conjugal life. While the true deprivation is paternity. This is the sacrifice. And the babies, and the children. Like yours. - And you? Always alone? Are you worried? No women writing sweet letters during war time? Red Cross nurses and my mother. Yet in Cairo or elsewhere you must have been courted by women: they've always had a weak spot for you. Sure! A very fascinating woman pushed me into a corner and told me the kindest thing: "In privacy, would you put your cassock on again?" And what happened next? Nothing! I have other things to do. What stopped you? I answer you like the Emperor of Byzantium. Remember? If a king renounces the throne for what he believes to be his duty, he must act so that nobody may ever say he renounced it for a woman. You're not a king. I reign over myself. And it's very difficult. That's pride. - As if I didn't know that! On the other hand you and the professor are happy in the end that my renunciation wasn't stained with the vulgar pleasures of the flesh? True. Even if we'd had perhaps preferred you left the Church for a bit of skirt rather than for your great rebellion. Don't let's talk about this. - Yes! The professor entrusted to me the task of talking about it and I'm doing it. Alright. Thanks to your cook I have a little more patience left tonight. The professor thought that you needed to be really welcomed, not to feel alone, to be helped, guided. And he asked you to give me a map of Paris and some bus tickets. They told him you had shown your true humanity. Who said it exaggerated. He learned you pronounced the words of absolution for a dying man. The intelligence service works very well, it's just that you are wrong every time about the intentions. Would you have cheated? - Good! Immediately a calumnious interpretation: It's all clear-cut with you, no shading: either white or black! You can't conceive that one can lie to a priest to help him die, only because I pitied him, only because I loved him. We thought it was a sign? - What sign? Tongues of fire sat upon me? Pentecost and 14th of July? He was hoping! And I too was hoping you'd come back to the Church. We were hoping you'd repented. From prison camps to the convent, eh? What a masterstroke! You can tell them it's out of the question. Rather, during imprisonment I wrote a book that will cause a sensation. With this.. I'll give serious headaches to your dear friends. 33 years of Jesus, 2,000 years of Judas May I take the scissors, mom? - Sure! You should get glasses. - I'm not that old. Also this morning the journalists came. And the photographers. How bothersome are those people! They think they are at home! - That's true! But thanks to my book, we'll be able to redo the roof and clean up the garden. Like old days. - The old days! When your dad and I were happy, you a model pupil. But what are you doing! How clumsy you are, palikaraki! Never tell the journalist you call me so or they'll make fun of me. That would be it! - Listen, mom: in your letters to the camp you never called me so. Why? Because in our country, Greece, palikaraki means little soldier. Oh, I know! And a prisoner is a poor wretch, surely not a fighter. Now fortunately you're a free man and you can fight. And most of all obey, because, let's say it, I obey to you as to a general. Don't give me the sweet eyes, as your uncle Epaminondas would do to charm me. If you obeyed me like a general, I think you'd never ever have written that book. You didn't read it. - Of course. Is your mother not allowed to read your books! My dream is that you obtain a position at the Sorbonne. But now I have a good job. While Dad belonged to the institute, he never had the chair of religious history. It's true. For whom is that? - Gérard Lacassagne. It's your young friend. - Him indeed, yes. The young priest. 8 pairs of shoes. The winter ones are ugly, but for the seminary.. Are you taking the silk shirts? No. I leave them to your husband: he's lucky. He doesn't need to wait for my death to inherit. Miss Catherine is here. - Let her in. You'd have done better saying you weren't in. - Odile! Good morning, Gérard. - Good morning, Catherine. Your luggage? - We are packing. I packed twice in my life: for the war and now. Take, it's for you. - I beg your pardon. That's Morand's book. Will you let me read it? I can neither authorize nor forbid. You won't take it with you to the seminary. - No. Even if for me Maurice is a friend, for the superiors he's an enemy. He inflicts terrible blows upon us. - Gérard! Aunt Jean wrote: she want you to visit her before leaving for the seminary. I'll go for sure. I won't miss the opportunity. I hope that, notwithstanding her ideas, aunt will receive me when I am a priest. Will you lend it to me? If you care. - Thank you. Dear madam, your initiative is understandable. But, it demands a sincere explanation. Has Gérard happened to tell you that he is a disciple of Maurice Morand? Disciple of Morand? You use an exaggerated expression. I asked our postulant to avoid seeing Morand, at least for some time. Well he accepted my request without a blink. Disciple, you say? Please read this dedication written by Mr. Morand. "To Gérard, at the time when he enters the imposture. That he may not forget his just revolt and our common passion for truth, this book that he knows as well as Maurice Morand. Pontoise." Look, it's dated yesterday. Madam, for sure the Church doesn't need false vocations. Maurice Morand is an example too evident. We'll reexamine Lacassagne's application in the light of what you've just told me. Could you tell me in which camp they were prisoners? - 13-4 I think that Gérard should not know that we spoke. If Mr. Lacassagne should one day come back to your side, it's even necessary that he shouldn't know. Then one day I'll tell him, when he's my husband. And he'll understand that it was love that pushed me to here. If he can ever understand! Philippar, Get me the war-chaplain's office, please. I want to speak to the director. Bastard! You're a bastard! Don't pretend you don't understand, swine! Is that the new vocabulary for seminarians? I knew you hated us. I knew also that the Church didn't let you sleep. But I didn't know you were an informer, a spy. Careful with what you say, kid! A great liar, a delator. - Are you gone crazy? I lost everything because of you, understand? It's your fault that I won't be priest. They don't want me! Are you happy? But say it, damn it, say it before I smash your face. Excuse me, if they rejected you, what can I do? You've the wrong address. "A disciple of Morand," that's what they said! "We have evidence of it written by Morand himself"! Who gave them that evidence? Not I for sure! If you don't believe me, there's the door: you may leave. Is it my fault if they collect information, like a bourgeois before hiring a baby-sitter? If you knew it, Maurice! But I know! You're Catherine. - Catherine Grandpré I know why you've come. You're wise. You're here to limit the damage. No physical damage. But he.. Gérard! Poor Gérard! They don't want me. I know. I was at your house. Did you come to console me? That's my role as a woman. - It's all useless now. There's nothing you can do. Yes, I can, Gérard. I can help you, understand you. Trust me! I am strong! Let me take your hand! The fact that the Church refuses me doesn't limit my vocation. But they slammed the door in your face! My vocation turned out stronger. Sometimes I thought I was unhappy. But I was wrong. Only now I know what unhappiness is. I didn't want this! Poor Catherine, you've nothing to do with it. It is my fault. I told them you were his disciple. I brought the dedication letter. I didn't want to lose you, Gérard, because I love you. Is this love? - Yes, this is love. The only excusable sectarianism. You won't leave him so, you won't abandon him? Haven't I made him suffer enough, unwillingly? It's because of you that he took into his head the idea of becoming a priest: only to replace you! That's how Gérard is. That's trouble for us three. All this is absurd. Absurd! Oh, yes! If he loved me, he'd ask me to console him. He wants nothing more to do with me or with life. Passion, ruin, vocation.. disorder! Gérard will become a priest. He'll never have to say that your love and my friendship hindered his vocation. There is a person. Yes, he is a priest: an honest priest. They're not all impostors there. He's able to receive you in his seminary, with no regard for our friendship. You'll go and see him. If he rejects you, it won't be because of me. But because your vocation won't seem good enough. Only then he'll reject you. And you thought that Morand's support would open you the doors of our house? I thought that my friendship for him wouldn't close them. You're right. I can't say yet I consider your vocation well founded, but to decide about it together, I'll welcome you to this house. In the first year, my boy, you'll face many trials: you must think of nothing but of judging the depth of your vocation. If it should become less imperious.. - Oh, no! if God's hand should push less forcefully on your shoulder, you'll be able to leave the house whenever you wish, without asking for authorization or giving any reason, and without shame. We'll maintain all our esteem and friendship for you. Is it clear? - Yes! Fr. Superior. - Yes, Fr. Superior. Well, go fetch your luggage in Paris. - It's downstairs. Don't you want to think about it? Well done! Since this chair was given me close to the break, the next meetings we'll limit ourselves to examining general character problems. And first of all what has personally affected me.. most of all others, in the last days. What kind of call to priesthood do the men in the different religions obey? What pushes them to renounce freedom? To submit the body and the spirit.. to a heavy daily discipline? I think it is essentially and most of all generosity. This is the theme we'll discuss, if you will, in our next meeting. Mr. Professor! What are you doing here? - I came to listen to you. What you say is not new, but you say it well. I've always a soft spot for good orators. And for good umbrellas. - A gift from the Satrap. Natural silk, Java bamboo handle: it's beautiful. When you're a bishop, I'll have it covered in purple for you. I count on it, but don't hurry, you can wait, you know. Tell me, Maurice: I'm curious to know what you'll say on priests' generosity. Pupil Morand, answer: I'm listening. You never change, you remained a professor. And you a pupil. Look how easy you gave up the chair, as if it were due to me. As if Divine Prov.. - No, Jusseaume, no sermons. No sermons, I promise. I come for Gérard: you've very kind to send us your friends. An exchange of courtesies: every day some sheep of yours leave the fold to come to me because of my books. The last one is ghastly: worse than the others! - Sermon! 2,000 years Judas: how dare you? Look at me, Maurice, call me Judas. And does young Gérard have the Iscariot's face? Gérard? What do you expect from me, professor? Does dealing with that soul scare you? - I'm scared with all. With him in particular, perhaps because he's a friend of yours. Are you restless? Well, better so. I thought that in the long run you had acquired an accountant's calm. Calm I, who am your friend? You're the man in most danger! When whatsoever, Maurice, a germ, a bus may kill you before one may save you. Save, save: big words right away. Yes! And who should do it? Those who love you! I first. And believe me, it's a lot of work. And the others. The Satrap thinks of me in between stock charts! - Right! And that's the miracle! Money spoils all and the Satrap, with all that, prays for you like a brother. By worrying for you, he perhaps saved himself from the egoism of the rich. And you know, to save a rich man.. - It's a tough job! And beside the Satrap, there is good Gérard, whom God placed on your way. And your mother! I forbid you.. - You can forbid nothing, especially to pray for you as I want! Yes I forbid you! - Not at all! We'll pray as long as we wish to! We'll implore God for you! There's no limit to hope! What is this tyranny? Excuse me, professor, do you need me? No, my friend, I wasn't hurting him. We were discussing philosophy, right? Besides, I care too much for my umbrella to hit him with it. You may leave. Did you see, Maurice? You scared that good man! What cheek: it's you who shout and I who scare? There is still the "Ecole Normale"! - That's true! Thalatta! That is it, said Xenophon. # And we sing : we are tala tala tala we are those who go to mass.. # You're always off pitch. - And you always off beat. Your laughter has so little to do with your sordid works! And sometimes on that big, old, priestly face of yours, the smile of the good school teacher reappears. Even if you wear the cassock, I love you. And I even if you don't wear it! I'm leaving now: it's going to rain. I don't want to ruin the Satrap's beautiful umbrella. So long, professor! Aren't you going to talk about Gérard any more? - No! I know you won't do anything against that boy's peace. Of course! Was that the reason of your visit? You know, when I think of you and your pain, I ask God: Why he? Why not me? Mr. Jousseaume, it the same question I ask myself, I who have the truth: Why me? Why not you? Lacassagne, Lacassagne! It's good to relax and do some exercise, but not too strenuous. Remember that your wound hasn't healed yet. Yes. - Good! - Come on! Pull! Pull! Egyptian cults, Persian influences, the extension of the Egyptian creed into the Eastern Mediterranean, the Sumerian and Assyro-Babylonian religions. Religions and mythologies of the Indo-Europeans. Judaism and Semitic Unitarianism. Even in the East, in those far away lands, we see the same phenomena. A revealed theism that results in a church less organized than the European churches, but that does not at all betray the divine message. Our course ends here and it will resume next November. Lacassagne! What does it mean? Aren't you packing like the others? I'd like to spend my vacations here: I'm very behind in theology. I don't like excessive zeal. I already told you, I think. You'll leave like the others, rest like the others, relax like the others, and you'll see your friends again, all those waiting for you. Are you perhaps afraid of seeing Morand again? I don't think he'll see me. - Sure! Leave the cassock here. And since you'll see Morand again, I beg you, don't forget you're the last tie between the Church and him. I'll remember. - One more word. Before Maurice, remain calm, don't provoke him. Charity, full charity, but don't let yourself be overcome. Defend yourself and defend us. Remember that you represent the Church. I'll remember. You're sending him to our worst enemy! Aren't you asking too much of that boy? If he resists Morand's violence, we'll be able to rely on him. He'll become a convinced priest. And if he should not resist? His eternal salvation? And Maurice Morand's salvation? Enough. - Not without thanking you! - Go. I always give thanks when I collected alms. - Go! I used to say: may God reward you. May God reward you. Gérard! Out! May God reward you, Maurice! - Am I bothering you? I didn't expect you. Do you remember the camp? We met in a barrack. I didn't forget it. Sit down. Your wounds haven't healed yet. And morale? - It's good. Still apprentice-priest? - Still. Without cassock? As you can see. - That is kind of you. But I've too much imagination not to picture you with the black robe on. It's as if it were on you. Are you happy to see me? Yes, Gérard. But I know we won't be alone any more in our meetings. You came to me because they told you to. You're not wearing the cassock because they told you not to. Didn't they? I know them, you know! - Who's attacking? Is it you or I? Alright! It's I. It's stronger than me. Did you see that bum at the door? Could you tell me who that idiot is? A poor man. He's not evil. An unfrocked one like me! Well, I much prefer his shame to your beautiful consciences! I understand you. Why then don't you do like him? Why do you almost live like a priest? Like an ascetic priest? I'd like to understand the reason. Who do you take me for? I have nothing in common with that poor drunkard. Like most of the unfrocked I know, he disgusts me. Since my book came out, they keep coming here and pester me. Look! Look at the letters they write to me! They'd like to have me as cover, as standard bearer! Just think! As if I could ever accept that! Me! And your father? He's fine. He's calmed down. And Catherine? Poor Catherine. I'll see here. I must see her.. later. Her too? And without cassock! But this is a baptism of fire! A roundabout of temptations! What a program! I started from you. - I'm flattered. Gérard Lacassagne, my mother. This boy is that young.. - The young curate, yes mom. Ah! He came to visit you. So kind! He's not afraid of you. He loves you, doesn't he? It's because you know him: who knows him loves him. It's just that his books are between him and the people, and so he makes himself hated. - Did you hear, Maurice, what your mother said? She never reproaches me, she respects my ideas as I hers! - That's true. If you came to turn my mother against me.. But Maurice, come on! He's so young! He's a priest like the others! Already a priest! A perfect priest! And he started the assault right away! - It's my fault! Come here, my boys! I believe in your good faith. Yes! You'll quarrel while seated. It's better. Sit there, young man. You sit on the other side. I'll be in the middle. You won't quarrel any more? Can I count on it? Then I'm going to fetch dessert. - Honey cake? It's nothing special. It's very good! You know that I'm in good faith. It's just that.. that drunkard.. and the others bother me. Your idea makes no sense. To gather all the unfrocked at Morand's! You're disconcertingly naive, Gérard. - No, Catherine, the plan is good. You didn't hear Maurice talking about the unfrocked and shouting with disgust. He's terrorized of being mixed up with them. His mother knows him well. She not only approves but she's helping me. Let me read the letter again. Dear Sir, My son wishes to see you on Friday, 21 at 17:00. I count on your presence. Helene Morand. And to whom did Mrs. Morand send this circular invitation? To those his son hates most. But why? When Maurice returns from Paris, where every Friday he goes to correct exams, he'll find the unfrocked gathered at his house. He'll have a fit of disgust. And at the climax of his pride, he'll surely prefer.. to return to the Church, rather than being mixed up with those unhappy wretches. You hope in this way to make him suddenly return to his good senses. Maurice is violent and impulsive. The same pride that made him lose the right path will save him this time. What can I do to make you return. the Gérard that was? This one! Who used to smile to me when I'd tell him that I loved him. Catherine: Morand must be saved! - Morand, Morand, it's always him! But you didn't ask permission from your superiors. - No. Why? You did have the time. Were you afraid they'd refuse, weren't you? - Yes. And how do you think they'll react in case of failure? With a reprimand. Perhaps they'll throw me out. I don't want to start to hope again! If I don't save Morand, I'll die desperate. God made me meet him. Help me. Me? I really don't know how. But I'll be at your side anyway. In good and bad, always as long as you'll allow me. Because your God made us meet too. They're late. - Not yet. That runs fast. Patience! Sit down, Gérard. Stop moving around. I recognize him. I saw his photo in Maurice's diary. He's the antiquarian. I believe he's the most dangerous. Please, have a seat, sir. - Thank you. No, no: stay with your mother. Play here outside. We won't enter. I knew that he would've done something. That he'd have taken the initiative. A damned Church, sure, but powerful! This is a great day for us, madam. A day we were all waiting for with an almost religious impatience! Morand! I knew that Morand would gather us! I don't understand your silence, gentlemen. I'm sorry, I'm very, very sorry! It was kind of Maurice. Wasn't it? Really very kind. Because Maurice looks arrogant sometimes but.. I don't hold it against him. Because he has a good heart. And I.. I love.. good-hearted people. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Maurice! What's this congress of the unfrocked in my house? It's a trade union. It's an army! I told you I wouldn't see you. Don't you understand? How can I tell you? It's you who invited us. Anyway, I don't think it is a "congress," to repeat your expression. If I had known, with no offense to these gentlemen, I wouldn't have come. I've nothing to do with it. They've abused your good faith. I've nothing to say. And never will! Don't be upset, Maurice: you were very kind. Very kind: it was between us. What?! -You get too upset, Morand. I'm surprised. Whatever the reasons, which I don't know, of the comedy we've been involved with, Your indignation surprises me. To disown is too easy. We're all on the same boat, my dear. No! - Yes. No! Yes, all five of us. All together. You forget too quickly. I can understand the editions, lectures at the Sorbonne, glory.. Nevertheless.. - Professor! there is no need to spit on your colleagues, Mr. Successful-Author. Because, whether you like it or not.. - Rev. Fr. Morand! we're all, you included, unfrocked. Unfrocked! You say well. Thank you for having reminded me. I won't forget. Maurice, don't get upset. You've been kind anyway. This meeting was a misunderstanding.. terrible. I beg your pardon. I am ashamed of it. Bye, bye, Maurice. I won't remain one day longer in a house where such squalid ambushes are laid. Maurice! - I'll leave tomorrow. Don't worry, mom. All this is your work, isn't it? I'm not mad: you do priestly work with so little skill because you're still sincere. Experience will come with the years. And prudence too. It's prudence especially.. that you lack. And intelligence! And judgment! Mediocre! What you consider charity is egoism! It's a provocation: you wanted a prey all for yourself. If the professor has still some sense, he won't give you back the cassock. Clumsy! - I wanted to save you. Wrong, boy! You and I will never meet again. Because I hope you understood it. No, actually. If I left you now, I'd have a very bad memory of you. Moreover, after all these emotions, I need some release. We'll dine together. Will you? - Yes! No, no: don't follow my son! Yes, ma'am: my place is next to him. You see, mom, the boy understands. A definitive separation must be celebrated. If you wish Catherine's presence.. Miss, don't follow my son! Madam, it's Gérard that I won't leave. Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! Listen, is this white wine good? - Yes, sir. It's Blanc de Blanc '42. '40. - Don't you think we've drunk enough? Two bottles for two people and only half a glass for your guardian angel. No. Leave it. - Yes, sir! You drink white wine after Champagne? That's strange. Catherine, Maurice has been so kind to me. Try not to argue. With pleasure. But I'm allowed to say that to mix these two wines is a sin. - Alright! You've tormented us all evening with your theories about sin. Now it's your guardian angel's turn to preach! He wants to drink it all! No! Well, not gulping it down as they do. Do you see any difference between a man or a priest for the sin of irreverence? No. The offense to God, if it is mortal, is of a degree.. Shut up, Gérard, for the sake of .. - God! - Yes! I don't know what you have in mind, but I'm afraid. Stop it! Tell him, Gérard. But I can't! Do you maintain your point of view? Yes, of course. Then I'll teach you a lesson for life. Let's go away, Gérard. Let's get out! Look at his eyes! We needn't stay here any longer. No, why? Aren't you afraid? No, not of you: we're friends. - You're right. But even among friends, one can teach or learn a lesson. Let's see. In your opinion, I'm still a priest, aren't I? A priest, Maurice. For ever. Then a few seconds will be enough for me. This wine is good, Gérard. It's pure and conformable to the canons of the Church. If I pronounce a few words in Latin, It won't be any more Blanc de Blanc 1943, but before you, you'll have the Blood of Christ. No! Maurice! - You must stop! You are crazy! For this is the Chalice of my Blood, of the new and eternal testament; the mystery of faith: which shall be shed for you and for many unto the remission of sins. That's it. Don't drink. Don't touch it. I've plenty of time. No, Catherine. Don't stay here. Leave me alone. It's clear that you too have gone insane! I must be fasting, Catherine. There's only one way. You want to take Communion, to drink the wine. Fasting is not obligatory in these cases: you know that better than me. I don't want to mix the Blood of Christ with all that I ate. Oh, a full glass! Lord, I am not worthy.. and my soul shall be healed. Come on! - Alright. I'm coming at once. What's going on? Come, at once. Come! Gentlemen, the king of the night! Did you enjoy yourself, sir? Are you content, sir? Did you feel comfortable? Thank you! The fire! I have to charge you also for the tablecloth. Linen is so expensive! Tonight I'm rich. I've earned thirty pieces of silver. Taxi, madam? - No, thank you. Gérard! So? I despise you. I detest you. - See? As a man, I condemn you. Say what? A Blanc de Blanc of '43? But are you really happy? To behave like that you must be suffering the pains of Hell! No. Sit down, come. - No, you must be pardoned. Yes! But how can we do it? Only a priest can forgive your sin. Unfortunately you don't have one at hand. - Yes, me. Now I'm sure I won't return among the people any more. Good bye, Catherine. Good bye. Good bye, Gérard. Good bye. It's a priest who forgives you. Here it is: it's really a rats' nest. It's uninhabited since the death of poor Onorine. It's not reasonable. If it was fitting for an old housekeeper, it will fit my solitude. I gave my resignation from my chair. I have my books to write. As you wish. My editor will send you a monthly check that will allow you to live comfortably. Good bye, mom. - Good bye, Maurice. Now I'm not your palikaraki any more? No. As in the camp? - Yes. You're again in captivity. A prisoner of yourself. What do you want? - Don't you maybe need a cleaning lady? I could do it. - It's not necessary. I need nobody. Nobody! Go away! It will be your morning exercise. Lacassagne! - You do it. I pray for the prisoners. For those that man's justice enclosed within four walls. An for those who are enclosed for their blindness in falsehood.. and error. Free them, o Lord! - Free them, o Lord! Free them. I called a priest. Your mother asked for one. I count on your common sense. May almighty God have mercy on thee and having forgiven thee thy sins, bring thee to life everlasting. Amen. Now, I'm giving you absolution. I absolve thee from all thy sins, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Recite, if you can, the prayer of acceptance of death. Lord, into Thy hands I commend my spirit. I offer you.. I offer you.. I offer you all the suffering of my life, and especially those caused by my son. Depart, O Christian soul, out of this world. Abandon yourself to Divine Mercy. It's finished. Finished. She had a rosary. A big rosary of olive wood. Yes! It came from Carmel. I wanted her to carry it in her voyage. Here it is! And what are these? The money your editor was sending her every month. She didn't touch it. Your mother considered it accursed. How did she live then? Her pension is not.. - She let herself die of starvation. And the first cold weather struck her down. Who put that idea into her head? They, again! It's always the Church! The priests! What are you doing here? Without you, without those like you, my mother would still be alive. Go away! Leave this house! Go to Hell, murderer! First class funeral service, of course, and the faculty and institute paying.. and the Archbishop, the Papal Nuncio and also the treble voice choir? My mother will have a civil funeral service. Journal of an assassin. Those wretches sustain that I killed my mother. But I know that Jesus is with me. May I speak to you? ..now and in the hour of our death. Amen. Sure! I feel that Morand needs me. No, Gérard, no! You're about to take Holy Orders. No fancies, no visions, no thought transfers! Feet on the ground, my boy! But Maurice is so lonely! God will make him fall into the net on the day He, not we, has chosen. In the mean time, pray for Maurice. Only prayers! And never stop doing it! Maurice, on the 28th I'll be a priest like you. I owe you my vocation. Thank you. Gérard Monday, the 25th. Tuesday, the 26th, Wednesday, the 27th. Today. It's forbidden to talk to oneself, old boy! Be careful! That whatever these hands.. may be blessed, That whatever these hands bless, may be blessed, and whatever they consecrate, may be consecrated in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. - Amen. No, Catherine, no! Never more! Receive the power to offer sacrifice to God, and to celebrate Masses for the living and the dead, in the name of the Lord. Amen. No, Gérard, no. Receive the Holy Spirit. Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained. It's false! Jesus never delegated such power! Be honest, professor! Tell Gérard! You must not let him accept this imposture! Do you promise me and my successors reverence and obedience? I promise. The peace of the Lord be always with you. Amen. To ask for the gift of tears. Yes, Catherine! Yes! I cannot cry. And may the blessing of Almighty God, + the Father, + the Son, and + the Holy Ghost, descend on you and remain with you always. Lord, Lord, protect Maurice! That he may do nothing against you until I'm with him. No, Gérard. Not today. My soul doth magnify the Lord. And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. Tonight, sisters, we'll pray for a soul in danger that was recommended to us. My God! For thirty years I've loyally served you day after day, without mercy for myself. That mercy that I refused, You have it in your hands. Give it to that boy I've just put in danger. And to that sinner who is my beloved brother. Because he's your son too. Father! Our father! Our Father, who art in Heaven. I can pray you so badly! It's not for me that I pray: it's for Maurice, for Gérard! Return Maurice to Gérard! We are just poor men! Lord, don't leave Maurice outside of Your Kingdom! Have mercy on him! My God! I know that one should not treat You as a merchant but a king. I offer my loneliness and my solitude. I pray you, I beg you! That Gérard may return to you him who suffers and is alone. So be it! Yes, so be it, Lord! So be it! No! Our Father Who art in Heaven. The Galilean! Our Father. Our Father Who art in Heaven. Protect me from them! They know not what they do. They don't know that behind them there is one who wants to interfere. Stop him! My God! I know that between me and him I'll find the Devil! Give me the strength to drive him away! Is this the way You defend me? Can't You hear them? Can't you live me alone? Palikaraki! Enough reproaches! Go away with your assassins! Maurice! Sacerdos in aeternum, and that I called him. - You, Mascle! No! Let the dead bury their dead. - And that I called him! Maurice! I can't hear any longer. You Carmelites disgust me! No! That his blasphemy may not stop us! We who love him, dead or alive, let him hear us! Holy Mother of God! This is my son, my child! Receive your remission in the name of Christ, Whose servant and priest I am. As you are, Maurice, as you are. I pray you, I beg you! I pray you, I beg you! Maurice, like Lazarus in the grave you're dead and buried. Your soul is already rotten like a corpse. Maurice, come out of the grave, tear the darkness, walk towards the light! The Sun before you is the white garment of the Lord! And behind him there is His Church, from whom you cannot separate yourself. His Church, remember! That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my Church. Christ's Church! Holy Church! My Church! My Church! My Church! Accomplice of Your Church! Protector of Judas! You too knew anguish in the Garden of Olives. Be my strength! Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! But why masquerading yourself? Why taking the voice of that young priest? After thirty years you've been tormenting me, I'll see you at last! Come in! I've nothing more to defend myself, not even a sign of the Cross. Show yourself! What do you want? A cup of coffee. It's you! - Homo quidam A man made a great supper. And he sent his servant to say to them that were invited, that they should come: Quia parata sunt omnia. For now all things are ready. Maurice, I've come to ask you.. - No. Coffee first. All the roads pass through Emmaus. Mine too. I'm not sure to be right any more. My path has become a habit. Before me there's a wall. I can't turn back again. But I look behind and repent. It was quite different matter at the camp. I ask you to have the courage to confess your error. Nothing more? Already? You wrote it: I'm not sure I'm right any more. My path is habit. There is a wall. Who gave you permission, priest? - I can turn back anymore! Shut up! - But you wrote it! You wrote it! I can't turn back again. But I look behind and repent. You wrote also: repentance attracts me as a whirlwind. It makes me feel dizzy. I can't reject it any more. I can't reject it any more. You thought you separated yourself from Christ, you threw Him to us, but you followed Him nonetheless.. onto the Church, onto me. I was given authority. I'm certain of your repentance and good intentions. You threw Him from above, but He is within you. Then I absolve you in the name of the Savior. Ego Ego .. te absolvo a peccatis tuis in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Stand up! I didn't kill you. Stand up! Here. Stand up.. and walk Ask Him for forgiveness. Yes. To the Church too. Yes! Acknowledge your errors. Yes. You won't do them any more? No! I can leave. No. Oh, no, Gérard: you must live to help me! My way will be hard. Depart, O Christian soul, out of this world. Abandon yourself to mercy. Wait! What happened? Come on, answer! Is he a relative? Your son? He's the son of man. You must follow us. Yes, I killed him. I hand myself over to justice. My name is Morand. I am a Catholic Priest. My soul doth magnify the Lord. And my spirit hath rejoiced in.. God.. my.. Saviour.
