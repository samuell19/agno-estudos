Subtitles by explosiveskull Now, onto trail conditions, we've got another cold front coming across Truman county for the next few days, onto the weekend. Temperature drops overnight can hit 25 degrees. Make sure to carry with you extra water and be prepared for an increase in frostbite related calls. Stay safe. Stay warm out there. If you see any hikers out there, walk them through our standard precautions. Sorry, sorry, sorry. We'll be moving the public waiting line for the Botany exhibit indoors through the rest of the week. Hey. - Honey. - Mm-hmm. There has also been an increase in bear and mountain lion sightings in the upper west end trails. As winter's setting in, they're coming down the mountain looking for food. You don't want to be that food, especially those of you heading down the back country. Okay, we're gonna do a roll call. Just give me a here people and we can get this wrapped up. Oh, and no trades day of shift. It's getting too confusing for the office to keep up. - Okay, Adam. - Here. - Craig. - Here. - Daniel. - Here. - Davey. - Here! - Chip. - Where have you been? My car broke down, I missed the bus again. - Maya. - Um, present. Oh, Ms. McHolmes, how nice of you to join us. Maybe you wanna tell us what uh, whatever tale seems to be so much more important - than my morning minutes. - Um... Actually, you know what? Why don't you come on up here and do it for me, and then I can sit down? Um, no ma'am, you're doing great. I mean, uh, I didn't mean, uh... I mean... Remember people, to be early is to be on time. If you are not checked in at the beginning of my safety meeting, minutes will be deducted from your timecard. For those of you who haven't checked yet, your assignments are on the board and assignment packets can be found in the eagle rooms. Stay safe out there! Stay safe out there! So, do you, uh, know where you're at yet? - Nah, I gotta check. - I'm at exhibits with Chip. Been after that guy for a week. Just look at his face. It's... It's so... - Frat boy? - Yes! Bing! Love it. Oh, looks like you're not the only one. Yeah, you don't have to tell me. She's been bird-dogging everyone I even glance at recently. Let's get her. Wendy, you really stepped in it this time. Are you trying to get fired? What? What do you mean? I was being sincere! Just, you know, the one time I'm late. Oh! What? Girl, you are late all the time. Come on, I'm not always late. It's adorable that you think that. Uh-oh. You're not on exhibits today. You're, uh, posting signs on Hitchback Ridge. What? No, no, no, no. I'm supposed to be on exhibits - flirting with a quarterback! - Nope. I'm on exhibits, you guys need to stop reading this wrong. - Um, Craigy. - No. - Craigy. - I'm not switching with you. I can do it. Yeah, you take the info booth and I'll take the trail and then... That way you get to see Chip all day. Hmm. I know that face. Yeah, that's your pity face. - No! - It so is. - I'll handle this for you. - Thank you. Maya doesn't think that you can do it. I'm just as qualified as you guys. Yeah, don't you mostly do like kiddie trails? What about the, uh, spider that made you jump... - Oh, my God. - ...15 feet across the way? You guys it was a black widow! - It was a daddy long leg. - It was a daddy long leg. So, I don't want you to get in your head - about this though, it's okay. - It's not a big deal. It's just that being on the trail, you kinda have to be, like, tougher. - Yeah, hardy. Yeah. Uh-huh. - Hardy is a great word. Uh-hmm. Come on you guys, it's just tying signs to trees. No, it's a lot of rough terrain. And you have to be ready to get your hands dirty, your pretty hands. Listen, you're an indoor kid, okay? - Like, uh, Davey. - Oh! - Oh, Davey? - Oh, Davey. - We're trading. - Wow, okay. All right, okay, fine, your... your funeral babe! - Thanks, Davey. - All right, calm down... Uh, let's switch packs, yeah? So, you don't have to go through outfitting. Yeah. Here ya go, and, um, you're sure you're okay, yeah? Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay. - I'll be fine. Great, I will see you later. Yeah, it's just a walk in the woods. I mean, how hard can it be? Jesus Christ, Davey. You scared the shit out of me! It's not my fault, I called your name three times. You didn't look up! Oh, I'm sorry. Lemme help you. - It's fine - Oh, nope, okay. It's fine. I've got it. Thanks. What are you doing out here? I'm refilling the dog shit bag holders. All the way out here? Not usually. Usually, I work with the maintenance crew, helping them with electric stuff. - Hmm. - But I left the gate open and one of the mowers rolled down the hill right into a maintenance shack so, now I'm on dog shit bag duty. Yeah. Do you ever feel like... I don't know, this isn't the right job for you? No, I mean, I may not be the biggest guy in the crew. They may not think I'm the best person for the job, but I know I can do it. That's what matters, right? Yeah. Well uh... I guess I'm gonna, you know... get back to it. Okay, right yeah. See ya! Hey! I could come with you! If you want. To make up for messing up half your stuff. - I'm pretty much done. - No, it's okay. It's just less work for me now, so... Right, right. I should probably go too. All right, see ya! Watch out for snakes! Okay, I will. Here. So... let's see. Okay. So, I'm here. I can make it up there. You lost yet? Yes. Okay. What's she talking about? I'm here. What? Okay. Let's get back here. Oh, shit. Hey! Hello! Are you okay down there? Hello? No, no. Shit! Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello? I, uh... I... I work for the park. Sir? Sir. Okay. Come in, this is Wendy McHolmes, is anyone there? Please, come in. I've... I've got a code 030. Repeat I have a code 030, over. I have a dead fucking body here. This is APAC Kevin at base, over. Oh, God. Hi, this is Wendy McHolmes. I'm on Hitchback just over the peak and, um, I have got a code 030. You're breaking up Wendy, can you repeat? Um, there's a man, I... I think he must have fell, um... Switch to channel three. Okay. Okay, channel three here. Are you sure he is 030? You checked all his vital signs? Yes, yeah, yes definitely. Um, he looks like he's been here, um, I don't know. He looks like he's been here a while, um, like a couple of days maybe. Wendy we don't show you on any trails today, you don't have that level of trail clearance yet. Yeah, um, I traded with Maya Davis earlier and, um, she had Hitchback. Fuck! Actually, I'm not actually on Hitchback. I don't think. Um, I don't have my map. And I must have lost it a while back on the trail. Copy that, okay now Wendy. Are there any distinguishable landmarks you can see? Um... yes, yeah, I can... I can see Brighton Rock, uh, just... just across the valley. Okay copy, see anything else? Uh, I'm on a ridge, just a big flat spot. That'll be a good place for you to be when the search team arrives. Now, is anyone else there? Is anyone else hurt? No. It's just me and him, I mean the body. There's, uh, there's no one else up here. Listen, it's a long ridge around Brighton but we'll reach out to the fire lookout station and the proper authorities. Be careful up there, that area has active wildlife warnings and category three terrain. It might take us a while to find you without an exact location, just secure the area and hold tight. Okay, um... do I leave a sign or tie a t-shirt to a tree? I mean, what... I mean, what... what do we do now? As I said, a park official must secure the area and you're a long ways out there. Are the fire lookout people gonna be here soon at least? Is... is anyone gonna be here soon? The area you're in is about six hours from base. It's 16:00 now, they're not gonna get to you before dark. That's... That's not until midnight now. I have to stay here until then? No, Wendy. You need to stay until morning. Every ranger pack is equipped for these types of emergencies. You should be fine for one night. No fucking way, are you out of your mind? I'm not staying here with a dead body! Look without an exact pinpoint location, you shouldn't move from where you are at all until we can send someone up there safely and that unfortunately won't be until morning. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit. Wendy? Wendy! It's Sandra. Listen, someone has to stay until the first responders can get to the scene. They can't get up there in the dark for extraction, it isn't safe. And me staying here is? Well, it's safer than you trying to come down in the dark without even knowing where you are in the daylight. There's miles and miles of unmaintained woods up there, Wendy. You could get lost and we'd never find you ever. But I'm not a forest, uh... service official or certified, whatever. And anyway, I'm like a park guide, you know, like, I like pick up trash and I like hand out pamphlets and I tell kids not to start forest fires, I'm not... Someone has to stay and trust me, I'm sorry that's you. They know the vicinity you're in, just, just stay put. Tough it out and we'll be there as soon as we can. And Wendy, you didn't touch or move the deceased, did you? No. Good. That's really good. Whatever you do, make sure that you... Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! No, no, no, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't. Fuck! Fuck! Hello? Anybody in there? I'm an employee with the park service. You know it's, uh... it's illegal not to answer a park employee. Oh, my God! Hey, hey are you okay? Shit, what do I do? Oh, fuck! Fuck. Fuck! Wait till dawn. Oh, shit. Wait till dawn. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so... okay, so... Okay. Okay. Anybody in there? Come in. This is Wendy again to office or Kevin. Come in. My radio is dying. Hello. Come on. Come in. Shit. Ugh, yes! Oh. Hello, this is Wendy to main station, over. There ya are! How ya doing out there? Have you secured the area? Anything to report? Um, I found a tent about half a mile from the body. But it didn't look like anyone had been there in a while. Copy. Did you find anything else? I thought there might have been something in the tent so I went in there to check if... Wait! You went inside the tent? That could be a crime scene. You should not have done that. Well I was just... I was just checking to see if there... if there was someone hurt or if there was someone in there. Look, I know this might be hard for you, but you might have just contaminated evidence. Evidence of what? Well, they probably just fell, nine times out of ten, that's the cause of death out here, and it sounds like that from what you've described but that's why the coroner needs to come so just don't touch anything else, okay? In the morning, you should get back up on that ridge so the search team can spot you. The team is gonna start... ...a little before dark, copy? There's someone here. What do you mean, like another hiker? No, there's just a man. He's just... he's just standing over the dead body. Well, go tell him to back off. That's the whole reason you're there. You just told me that there might be a crime scene and that means that he might be a murderer! Shit! No. Shit. You're with the park? Whoa, whoa! It's okay. It's okay. You're okay, okay? What were you doing? You shouldn't be here. I've been coming up here for years. No, I don't mean the woods. I... I mean, right there. There's been an accident. Who is he? I don't know, a hiker. The police are on their way. When are they getting here? Soon. Hey! Hey! Stop! You really need to leave. This is a crime scene. I thought you said it was an accident. Maybe. Maybe not. That's why you need to leave. Hey, what are you doing? You're gonna contaminate the... the remains. Oh, I don't think he's gonna mind. I said stop. Stay, right there. Which one is it? You want me to stay right here or go away? I can't do both. What were you looking for? Look, I know what a fall looks like. Broken neck, broken bones, and this just... this just doesn't look like that or at least not just that. What does it look like then? I don't know. That's what I was trying to figure out. I was looking for a wallet or ID or something, but he's got nothing on him. But I did feel... Hah! That thing doesn't still work, does it? Nah, it's dead. I got one just like it. Oh, you've got a phone? Ah, not on me. I think I left it at home. Always have that damn thing with me, you know? It isn't safe to be up here without a means of communication. You know? When did you say help was coming? Soon. Yeah, well, getting dark pretty soon. - Yeah, they'll be here soon. - Hmm. Lotta big critters up here. Actually, I'm surprised they haven't gotten to him yet. In fact, kinda... As a forest service marshal, I'm gonna have to request that you vacate the premises immediately. - Look. - Go on. I'm just trying to help, all right? Now, if you wanna stay up here all night, sit in the dark with a cadaver, that's your own damn business. But I'm telling you, this is not the kind of place you want to be at night. Especially a little thing like you. Lotta predators up here. If you find yourself face-to-face with one, don't run. You're still a couple notches down on the food chain. Remember that. Have a good night, marshal. What the fuck. Shit. This is... Oh, God. What the fuck. Okay. Hello. Is anybody there? Hmm. Okay. Wendy? Wendy? you just have to be tougher... tougher... tougher. Maya doesn't think that you could do it. If you get lost, we'd never find you... find you... find you... You aren't ready for this. Ever. Ever. And you have to be willing to get your hands dirty, to jump 15 feet across the way. You mostly do like kiddie trails, right? I'm sorry that it's you. That it's you. That it's you. Ha. Ha! You're just cells and tissues and atoms breaking down into their composite parts. It's a totally natural process. There's nothing to be afraid of. I'm not afraid of you. I'm not afraid of you. Hey! Stop! No! No! All right. No! Oh, shit! That's how we found you, we saw you up on the peak, and the next thing we saw, you were fighting a bear. I can't believe you fought a fucking bear, dude! How did they find me so fast? Sandra convinced the police to come out early in the dark. I mean, we followed the peaks by the moonlight almost all the way to Brighton Rock. To be early is to be on time. A fall then? No. These marks indicate a bear most likely got to him first. Poor bugger was probably still alive. Wendy, will you sit down? I mean, your leg. ...fall probably happened after. There's bear hair underneath his nails. You're real lucky, miss. Once a bear gets a taste for blood, there's no fear of humans left in them. This one was denned up in a cave not a quarter mile up that way. Real territorial this time of year. Smart of you not to run. If you had you would've ended up like this fella here. Wh... who was he? Red Bumgardner. He's a local hunter. He went missing a while back. Camping. Presumed dead. This can't be him. He was here. I... I... I talked to him. Look, honey, whoever you talked to, was not him. This man's been lying here dead for days now. No, I saw him, okay? He had a knife, and... Do you mean this knife? No. That... That's not possible. Well, we need to get his prints back to the lab to be 100 percent, but... - the photos match. - Photo? Oh now, we found this in his pocket. Here. It still works if you can believe it. It charged right up after we gave it some juice. I've been coming up here for years. I've got one just like it. There's a lot of predators up here. No! You had a rough night. You did good. There's nothing to be afraid of now. Miss? Miss? Is she okay? Are you all right? Wendy? Wendy? Subtitles by explosiveskull
