Layla, Rawad and Youssef Take care of the boys, and don’t let them leave. I’ll be back Come with me Sorry we can’t stay Aren’t you Youssef and Rawad, Rayya’s friends from college? We are Follow me Nice bouquet Who knows how to prepare this? I do Looks like you need a drink Ice? How do you know Rayya? She’s my younger sister So, you’re her sister living in France? Yes and I’m back How come? Let’s see... The raw kibbeh, the arak, um... the four seasons, the weather, skiing... And the Cedar tree! No, no! The Cedar tree is such a cliché Do you guys live here? No Youssef lives here, I am just visiting Where from? Berlin Don’t tell me you live in Kreuzberg we've had it with Kreuzberg Kreuzberg Prost! And are you happy here? Yes Nice Yeah, Youssef really likes living here And Kreuzberg is better? It’s very chic over there Is this ok? Wait, let me taste What is this? "The Truth" I inherited it from my father, God rest his soul You haven’t told me Did you like the concert? It was great It could use some work You’re right But all I care is that it makes her happy Ever since she found out that she has cancer these concerts have become the most important thing in her life Rayya has cancer? Ouf, this bourbon is too strong Maybe I shouldn’t have told you Why not? Nothing, but I don’t feel like talking about it So Rawad, do you like the coke? It's a nice house, isn't it? My father was good friends with an Iraqi architect called Refaat Al Chadirji He built ministries and squares in Baghdad and he built this house for him I remember when we were kids we used to spend our time playing on the shore but she used to stay inside my mother convinced everyone that she didn't like the sun but I had a feeling that she feared the sea Sorry The guests just left You guys doing okay? Yeah, great It looks like you’re doing more than great How are you Youssef? I’m ok What a great concert! Thanks, I’m so glad you came To be honest, I was a little hesitant but Youssef insisted we come It suits you to hesitate! Give me a hit of coke What’s with you? Move over Who’s a vegetarian or has any allergies? I eat everything So do I Very well Youssef, here’s a platter there are all kinds of cheeses in the fridge take them out and set them on it Rawad, do you know how to make a salad? Yes of course and I'll order a grilled fish from Abou Robert Fish? What are you all waiting for? Get to work! This should be Abou Robert The fish is here By the way... What does "Hasha Basha Tik" mean? It means... Hasha means... Hasha Basha... Basha Tik I was wondering... But now I get it This painting is beautiful Shafic Abboud All of these artworks are by artists who were dad’s friends Do you want more whisky? No thank you, I’m fine My father used to always say: “Life without food is a life lived hard, while life without art, is a life no more!” Since there’s a lot of art around us let’s eat Rawad is getting hungry You should try this cheese You can't mix fish and milk Try it, nothing will happen to you Doesn’t it smell wonderful? No, not the fish Smell it Oh wow What does it remind you of? I know this smell It reminds me of... Incense! No, not incense If you take the road up to Bcharreh... The Cedars? Yes! It smells like... souvenir shops in the Cedars Is this a cedar tree? Yes This means you’re sitting on something that’s over 1500 years old Isn’t that beautiful? What you’re talking about was a tree in a natural reserve No it’s not beautiful Youssef, relax, it’s just a branch Yeah well, you’ve always been like this Youssef If someone sacrificed a 1500 year old tree to make a table It means that everything that happens on it should be worth that sacrifice and there’s no room for bullshit Excuse me? Look at Rayya Look how beautiful she is Rayya is very beautiful When you look at Rayya and find her beautiful, you don’t think of all the sacrifices that came with that Beauty is beautiful It's logic that is beautiful Six years of Philosophy I remember her telling me something like that Four years at the Jesuits' two years at the Sorbonne and I’m working on my dissertation So Logic wasn't part of the old curriculum? Layla’s my older sister, but she's not that old but I don't think Logic was ever her favorite subject Definitely not the logic you’re talking about How many logics are there? At this table? Four This hummus is so good! That's our neighbor, whenever she makes hummus she sends over a plate They’re from the supermarket She’s lying What are you doing? You’ll see Taste it Not bad at all I just invented this mix! But I learned the secret from a Palestinian guy who makes falafel sandwiches at the Turkish market falafel with tofu, falafel with halloumi falafel with peanut butter He thinks that whatever you feed the Germans, they’ll eat But they’re delicious Who? The Germans? No, the mixes Thanks to him, I now mix things together and most of the times, they turn out good He seems like a nice guy Very nice It turns out he was born here, in the Shatila Camp and he fled to Berlin not long ago It seems like you know him well I try not to skip the market everything there tastes different the cheese, the vegetables, even Arabic has taste and you see everything in Ahmad’s eyes What do you mean everything? You know those dark Arabic eyes that make you feel safe to drown in them? Like Youssef’s eyes? Yeah, Youssef has those eyes Tell me, is this guy married? I don’t think so What difference does it make if he’s married or not?! No, I’m just checking up on the guy and anyway he should be in Palestine not in Europe making falafel with toofoo Tofu Until Palestine is liberated, let him wait in Berlin It’s better than the Shatila Camp Who says that Berlin is better, are you happy in Paris? Why wouldn’t I be happy in Paris? Well, Europeans can’t stand the sight of you Who’s “You” honey? If anything, since racism increased in France I immediately changed my name on the buzzer to Jamila Bouhired "Djamila" so they hate me personally "My friend Jamila A greeting to you wherever you are In prison, in torment, wherever you are" What is this? “A letter to Jamila” A song by Fairuz I can’t remember where I read this But they say that when the Arabs traded slaves they didn’t care about their skin color Really That’s very funny No really, they used to enslave anyone as long as they weren’t Muslim It was the Europeans who first decided that blacks were slaves and whites were the masters You think the Arabs were better? That's not what I meant One tells you that you’re born a slave because your skin has a particular color And the second gives you a chance to change everything you believe in so you can be free Choose what's better for you No one chooses anything No one chooses anything we’re all born slaves What is this Descartes or Aristotle? My father, God rest his soul Dad never said anything like this Ok Her father died when she was only nine years old What made you think of the slave story? She means that racism in Europe today exists because of their colonizing history Correct But I was also thinking of my concerts Hear me out I’ve been doing them for the past year and I choose who to invite every time on the condition that they don’t bring anyone with them I choose when they should come, what they’ll hear, and when they leave When I’m singing, I forget who I invited and who’s in front of me I don’t usually pay attention until the concert has ended and then they should leave Sometimes I wonder if they really are guests or they’re actually... Slaves Rayya, these are your guests you shouldn’t talk to them like that Rawad and Youssef aren’t my guests, they’re my friends and they are the only ones who would understand what I’m saying But I don’t understand! What don’t you understand? Rayya’s relationship with her guests is just like any two people abiding by the rules of their relationship You can call them slaves, or whatever if the word annoys you Haven’t you ever been in a relationship where you were stuck in the rules of the game and the goal was to play an unnecessary scenario just so you can feel anything at all? No Don't the filmmakers you work with have a problem that it's so obvious when you lie? Aren’t you an actor? Youssef was the best in class Does anyone know what happened to Rawan? She got married and left the country I never knew what you did after college I left but didn’t get married No really, what did you do? I left to Paris for a year so I can continue my masters in dance but it didn’t work out and I came back And what are you doing now? I'm singing Do you write your own songs? No I sing covers Where are you singing? Here Just here? Yes Aha, this alone takes your story of the slave trade to another level So, Rawad, tell us What are you up to in Kreuzberg? He’s eating falafel with... tofu? When I finished university I got a scholarship and went straight to Berlin I studied Media Arts And he works in television At the Deutsche Welle at the editorial office so I can get the residency permit and a salary every month... And on the day of the presentation he hung a piece of cloth on stage and screened the video Of course, teachers didn't understand anything and they failed him I’m working on a video installation I’m very excited about it but it’s been a bit slow lately Do you think of coming back? At first, not at all but things might be changing Take it from me, don’t come back It only brings disasters You came back And fuck that decision Wow No I’m very happy in Paris I have my apartment there, my friends, I live at my own pace and I can’t stand living in Lebanon, especially with the people here, and their mentalities This is the first time that Layla has stayed three months straight in Lebanon Rayya was very young when I went to France It’s the first time we've spent time together in a long time I feel like staying longer with her especially now, I won’t leave her by herself Of course Youssef, would you pour us some whisky? Yes, Ma’am Didn't you date in college? Yes, for a short while So after all these years you don’t feel anything for Rayya? Layla, now what? It’s just a question It’s normal for two people who shared something, when they suddenly see each other again, to feel nostalgic Am I right, Youssef? What do you think? You need to ask them Do you think that it was serious or that they were kids having fun? Who knows Don’t believe him Youssef knows very well how in love I am In love? With whom? Someone I know? No, someone he met in Germany So why come back then? The idea would be for us to live together in Lebanon or Germany So it’s serious Yeah, but It’s not up to me Someone’s finally got you by the balls Yeah, well... Anyway Cheers everyone and cheers to love How come you all lost touch? How come you all lost touch? How can anyone go for ten years without asking about their friends? Frankly, after I left for Germany, I lost touch with everyone here I barely saw my parents and Youssef, I saw by accident the last time I was here It’s normal, everyone went their way after college and if we hadn’t bumped into Rayya the other night and she insisted we come I wouldn’t have thought we’d meet again It’s true, can you believe what a trick you’ve pulled on us? We thought we were coming to have a quiet drink turns out it is a concert You had to see Youssef’s face when we got here I wanted to surprise you You did We looked like idiots standing there at the concert with a bouquet of flowers I’m sure all your friends thought we were those idiots who get the star a bouquet and hand it to her on stage You really did look funny Shut up Layla I’m really glad you came We are too Rawad can you give me a cigarette? Careful dear this causes cancer! Are you crazy? Layla told us in the kitchen What did Layla tell you? That you have cancer Cancer!? You told me not to let them leave! I can’t believe what you are able to do sometimes Me? You’re crazy Pierrot is cancer now? You’re calling him Pierrot now? Pierre is cancer? Well, he is killing you Rawad, lets move Youssef, please sit down my sister is disturbed don’t go because of what Layla said - Let me pour you a drink - You are both sick Who jokes about their sister having cancer? Calm down, don’t overreact Rayya has a better joke to tell you That's enough! You’re scary when you walk This is the first time someone’s given me this compliment I’m not surprised you took it as a compliment Good Why? It means you know me now I don’t know anything about you Youssef Rayya, don't you have anything to say? Rawad, did you feel anything? Like what? I've been thinking all evening about how to bring it up like an idiot I was wondering if the seaside suited her or if the mountains were better Seaside weather suits Rayya perfectly They say this weather is perfect for lost souls maybe you too should move here What, is it our turn now? Oh, it has been your turn since the beginning Every since the concert ended you’ve been trying, very politely, especially you Youssef to leave this house You annoyed the fuck out of me with your stinking values and logic you think no one noticed that you haven’t said anything about yourself while Rawad and Rayya bored me with their stories? What are you hiding? And you Rawad, you think I believe you saying that you are lost between Lebanon and Germany because you’re in love? Or because you don’t know what you are doing in Germany You both stayed here because you thought Rayya had cancer Great She doesn’t And now what, you’re leaving? Ignore her The phone is ringing Come Come! Aren't you going to taste it? There’s a cigarette on the plate Ok What’s so funny? In compulsory military service in the beginning they mix very strange things with the food so their tongues would go numb and can’t tell the difference in tastes so that at war they could eat anything without caring Yeah, I feel the same now You did your military service? On television What? He was preparing for a new role Stop, leave them I don’t mind What is the oldest wine bottle you have? A bottle that my father kept in the cellar and didn’t get the chance to open Can we? No So sing something for us No - You can’t say no twice - And why not? Because the ancient Romans use to say If the woman says "No" twice she won’t be able to bear children for 5 years and she’ll have to go to Baalbak and lick all seven columns There are six columns in Baalbak All six, and scream “Yes!” from the top of her lungs in front of the God of the Sun No, please, ok I’ll sing, what do you want? Something by Um Kulthum Can I say "No"? Ok And spent the night thinking of what has happened to you And what has happened to me And I said he has not experienced confusion upon when I greet him Nor has he experienced desire in my eyes so he kept speaking You can't stop like this Yes I can No you can't Yes of course, I can Come sing with me I want to complain to you from the fire of my love I want to tell you about what is in my heart And tell you about what is keeping me up at night And tell you about what is making me cry And to describe to you the exhaustion of my soul But my pride prevents me Now, go back You’re boring me with your Arabic music, don't you listen to anything else? Youssef is a great dancer A maestro Rayya... you don’t have cancer, right? No dear I don’t So tell me, are you really in love? Very much Are you? I don’t know anymore What does that mean? I think I’m bored... anyway, enough about me Tell me, is it the first time you feel so in love? Yes How are you sure? How am I sure? I mean how can you be sure that what are you feeling now is love and not just something powerful that might end at any moment? I don’t mean to diminish what you two have but it is very weird to take such a big decision such as moving from Berlin to Beirut, based on a relationship Haven’t you ever felt that what you are doing, can't be wrong? Towards someone? No But I feel like tonight everything's going as it should be Pierre Yes my love I’m sorry I can't come tonight I have friends over I know, I know I can’t do anything about it I will see you tomorrow, you will come here yes, you will come here take care Where do you want him to come? Here Why don’t you tell him to come now? Because he’s not allowed to come here It’s not good for Rayya’s health Fuck, this joke is never going to end This is another joke It’s the one I promised you Tell them your joke Pierre is the only guy I didn’t invite to the concert he happened to be there he’s not even from here he was on holiday from Paris apparenttly he came during the concert and saw me singing “Neighbor to the valley” by Nour Al Huda I felt like he could understand everything I was saying but in the same time he felt a bit shy, as if we were alone in the house and I was just singing for him but it turned out he didn't understand a word of Arabic That story was three month ago, it's great he's great You might not understand this but you know when a man touches you and you get really shy but you’re also happy because you can be shy in front of him? Of course Where’s the joke? My boyfriend What... your boyfriend? Pierre, he's my boyfriend Her ex You’re going out with your sister’s ex? No, Rayya isn’t so tender I met Pierre when I was in Paris, a year and a half ago like Rayya said, Pierre has a way of looking at you it’s hard to ignore it so I didn't I invited him to my table He was drinking the same bourbon I was We met a couple of times at the same pub in the Marais and then at my place Pierre is unlike any of the men I’ve been with I decided I wanted the relationship to evolve and I brought him to Lebanon First, we stayed at my mom’s place in Beirut because he wanted to get to know my family A few days later Rayya had a concert here The slut was singing on stage and the rest you now know You like the joke Mr Youssef? I wish she had cancer Youssef! Youssef Rawad And Rayya Every time someone picks a name, they will be asked to do something If the person accepts, we will each drink a shot and if he doesn’t, he will drink the four shots This is to warm-up Layla, since you’re the guest of honor we’ll start with you Who would like to start with Layla? I will Call Pierre and tell him to come over (Rawad) Youssef (Rawad) Rawad, he is yours Give me the car keys Rayya The guest of honor gets to ask Go ahead Rayya... Do the thing you do best There is something really beautiful about having sex just to have fun this pleasure of someone hurting you on the inside you’re hurting but you barely bleed you’re cramped but can barely scream It’s very powerful to fuck to fuck yourself, to have fun just to have fun not to bear children On the contrary, when you doubt that something is growing inside you, you kill it and drown it in alcohol, cigarettes and coke and you let Pierre’s hand punch you in the stomach until it dies Smell This is the smell of earth the smell of earth in autumn isn’t it beautiful? Only the man who understands sex between two women is capable of making a woman shiver What tells you that two women won’t want to have children with each other? What are you trying to prove? Prove? Nothing I’m just jealous Jealous? Of you Both of you Rawad Your have a hot ass I’m really happy you found someone who deserves it and deserves your kind heart This is father Rayya thinks she can protect him by buying him an ornate house drawn by hand It’s so Pharaonic, isn't it? Do you bring him gifts, darling? Let’s open it and see Stop it! Enough Sit down Sit What do you want? The bourbon No one move. Does anyone need anything else? A lighter cigarettes an ashtray and a drink How long are we staying? What do you want? A bottle of wine The coke is here, Bring me the fish that no one tasted Both of you, stop it You on this side, and you on the other No one crosses to other side You ask her questions from over there and she answers you then you ask her another and she answers No one asks two questions in a row And? Don’t ask me, ask her! Are you happy? Yes Are you happy? Yes Does he talk to you about me? No Do you hate me? Pass No What’s your favorite color? Pierre’s eyes I know this isn’t a question but if you tear my leggings I’ll end you Do you remember our father? Yes What do you remember? You can’t ask two consecutive questions Did you like Gilbert? Who’s Gilbert? Your mother’s new husband you idiot Of course not Anyway, they won’t last Whose turn is it? Yours You think he’s upset that I forgot his birthday? You didn’t forget. You decided not to go Whose cock do you think is bigger? Youssef's or Rawad's? Mmm... Youssef has big competition Hey! It’s none of your business what we ask Did you fall in love with anyone before Pierre? Love is for the weak I didn't leave anyone out Do you know how hard it was to find someone to have kids with? Do you know that Pierre didn't want to have kids at all? Yes But what he wanted was never important Rawad, are you staying long? Palestinians have been like this since 1948 and now you’re bored in ten minutes? What does this have to do with that? Everything "This" decided that "that" was the promised land so there were two peoples on the same land but there is a line between them and it was forbidden to ask any questions about it forbidden to say "this" or "that" This is what I’m working on in Germany This is the Germany project? You are placing Palestinians and Israelis facing each other and watch them asking questions? No I’m sitting on one side of the line And who is on the other side? An Israeli artist I met in Berlin There are people who are dying fighting the Israelis and you’re sitting in front of an Israeli asking her questions? Didn’t I say his projects are silly? It’s not like that What then? Don’t take it personally What do you mean? Because we’re not talking about you and me We’re talking about something that’s been dragging for 60 years and I’m trying to find a solution A lot of people before you tried How? With the resistance, treaties... Exactly, people who make treaties aren’t the ones who should reconcile those who fight, have never spoken with each other Does Ahmad know about this project? The falafel guy? Listen Rawad You know very well why it bothers me that you in particular, are doing this Youssef The kid is trying to be an artist It seems that he got excited over the idea that few people have an official enemy, and he decided to work on it The idea is actually not so bad Leave him be And anyway, I don’t understand the tension between the both of you Rawad, can I ask or can I only ask Rayya? They just love each other, it's fine Yes, it's fine (Rawad) I want a child What do you mean? I want to carry your child - No - No? You’re handsome and you’re cute I’m not going to say that you’re smart and you’re going to waste your sperm in him? Don’t tell me children shouldn’t be conceived outside of love... I miss you You miss me or did the lady turn you on? Layla is softer than you are They should stay at body temperature you have one hour to use them Good spot, Ms Rayya Do you bring any of your guests behind the microphone or are they all slaves? Anyway, I have a story to tell you about tonight’s slaves When you and Rawad were seeing each other Rawad was mine I used to hate you not because you’re a bourgeois but because you’re an idiot When I was good to you I pitied you because when you slept in Rawad’s arms you slept on our story, mine and his What you don’t know is that when I took Rawad to my village in the South for the first time I took him to Khiam prison where my father was imprisoned before the Lahed army took him to Israel and we never heard of him since We still don’t know whether he’s dead or alive but in the village, they decided that I was the martyr’s son The broken walls on Rawad’s arms are the Khiam prison walls This is the secret I entrusted him with because when I came to Beirut, I didn’t want to be "Youssef, the martyr’s son" anymore but I wanted to be Youssef just Youssef Oh, by the way I don’t know what he told you about the Japanese tattoo he has on his arm but simply it’s my name I honestly don’t really like tattoos especially when he did really useless things that I didn’t understand why he would want them on his body and he got a few just to piss me off like the waves that came through the walls or the spider that is climbing on his shoulder that whenever we argued he reminded me that you liked them What are we doing? We’re walking from one dot to another What’s wrong? I found a dot Move over, I’m on it I found another dot Like this one? No, prettier Show me, show me No, you slut Youssef Her father drew these dots for her When she's sad, she walks from here to there until she's happy and from here to there to be strong and from here to there to remember that she’s beautiful And why are you following her? I felt like it Ok, are you happy now? I’m happy whenever Rayya is happy And what are the other dots for? This one is for when she’s sleepy and this one for when she’s hungry and this for when she is taking things that aren’t hers Touché Very funny From this dot, you get the best view of the house Here is when I was five Six Seven Eight and here is when dad died There’s another one here There’s a lot of them There’s one dot in front of the door with a brass cask Rayya keeps filling it with salty water to ward off the bad eye from the house There’s one downstairs Her father told her: "Every time you want to hear my voice go down there and you’ll hear it" But what is this? This is something else He left her two other dots so she can decide on their function Nice So where are the rest There’s one here and one here under the microphone So what did you decide? I haven’t yet Can we help? No Here, you can do whatever you want without anyone seeing you Here, I can marry Youssef and here, I’m in Paris Pregnant? I’m going to get the couch in here does anyone want to help me? Youssef... Rayya and Layla seem to be getting along Don’t be too quick to say that They’ll be fighting again soon Don’t jinx them, give us a break I don’t understand how anyone could live in this house and not be happy Right? It’s such a beautiful house Imagine this was ours! If this was my house, it would have an opening towards the sea You? It would be lucky to have a window Oh shut up But if this was our house it would definitely have an opening towards the sea And you can add another opening to this wall you have on your arm Do you want to swim? Where is Rayya going? I don't know Where’s Rawad? He went swimming You want to go? No Come on the water looks great I told you I don’t want to Are you scared of swimming at night? No, I don’t like to swim at all You don’t like to or are you scared to? I’m scared What are you scared of? What do you mean? With the sea things are clear Whatever happens, it always wins If you don’t drown your are lucky, but you wouldn't have won I’ll go check on Rawad then I was thinking... your story about my tattoos is much better than the real stories No really Do you remember the story of this one? Yes, because you’re an idiot Who tries the needle on their own hand? And this one? Do you remember when I told you about how the waves reminded me of difficult times and you told me that this was the most ridiculous metaphor ever? I was just joking with you No, you’re right Even worse than this metaphor is that when I was 17, the current took me and I almost drowned but I won And this stupid tattoo here... I thought I wrote “love” in Japanese but it turned out to be meaningless And this one is supposed to be a spider looking for its home Is this Rayya? Rayya Rayya! You haven’t kiss me here yet Oh, enough already It’s a very beautiful evening Beautiful? I don’t think that this is the right word for it What’s so beautiful about it? You The place we’re going to is nice Where are we going? That you will not be scared to love me in the open Scared to love you in the open? What, you expect our relationship to stay the way it is, in hiding? What do you expect? I expect you’d unwind like you did tonight, so it gets better and better Rawad, I’m not one of your projects that you have trouble with and solve the next day It’s me, do you have a problem with me? You’re cute together We’re funny No, Rayya and I are funny you’re cute together... Sometimes I can hear the echo in the house as if the house were laughing at us We’ve entertained it quite well this evening You know, tonight reminded me of the parties my dad used to organize for his friends These dots aren’t just for Rayya Evenings would not end before someone smoked a cigar from the dot with the best view of the house or another recited a poem on the only dot where you could see Jaffa from Lebanon Jaffa? Come with me Dad decided that if you were to stand on this dot and look far far away and the weather permitting you could see Jaffa from here And this dot is Damascus They were all like pilgrims walking drunk towards Jaffa and they told her: "You are happy" and from Jaffa, they walked to Damascus and told her: "You are strong" They got to the third dot that my father called the "Point of life" everything ends with it and starts again they told life: "You’re beautiful" and they circled over and over again Jaffa, Damascus, Life Jaffa, Damascus, Life Local hashish is well worth its reputation
