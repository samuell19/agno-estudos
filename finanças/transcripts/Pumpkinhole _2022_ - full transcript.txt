Sorry about that. Had a problem in the shop. Somebody busted a... I don't know, whatever the fuck, right? - No problem. - All right, so you're Nick? - Yes. - All right, that's good. Don't want to interview the wrong guy here. Um, resume. All right. Okay, uh... Oh, wait a minute. You're Angelo's friend. You're Nick Palazzo. You're the guy who played for the Cyclones, right? Yep. Angelo said you, uh, may have a little opening here. I remember watching you in the playoffs in Arizona. Man, you hit a... A walk off home run to win the wild card. Remember that? Of course you do. I mean, when was that, 2004? Yeah. Hey, you know, Nick, I gotta say this. You had a great little career, man, and it's a shame it ended so quickly. I mean, you really had a lot of potential. I mean, shoot, what were you battin' before you left? Was it, uh... what was it, like 330? - 332. - Wow. All right. Good. All right, um... All right, listen, you gotta pardon my rudeness here 'cause I gotta ask you this question. I do it for everyone, all right? It's just that you've been unemployed, uh... for three of the last ten years, and you're gonna be working around a lot of heavy machinery, you know, so... have you been, uh... Have you had any problems with drugs or alcohol in the past six to 12 months? No, I've been, uh, clean and sober for over a year now. Whoa. That's great. Did you go to rehab? No, uh, just quit. Cold turkey? I mean... I mean, I drink myself. You know, just... Well, shit, just a little, you know, like, um... Like on the weekends, I'm watchin' the football game or whatever. It... You mind if I ask you a personal question? No. Go ahead. How'd you do it? I mean, you... You quit just like that. Was it, um... Well, one of those, uh, self-help programs or... did you read one of those books? I mean... I mean, come on, bein' around here? Hey, those boys at the tavern, they can throw 'em back, can't they? I mean, good for you. - Right. - I mean, shoot, I couldn't do it. So what was it? I just quit. - Hey, buddy. - Hey! - How'd it go? - Good, good. I gotta take a... A drug test, you know, standard thing. So you gotta piss in a cup or somethin'? Yeah. I think I can handle that, though. Nick, have you seen the Halloween decorations? Uh... bottom box, left hand side. Awesome. Can you put those up when you get a sec? Yeah. Guess it's that time of year again, huh? Yep. About to get wild. What's up, bro? Hey, what's up, dude? Uh, everything bagel, uh, lightly toasted. Everything bagel... Just that? Uh... yeah. Everything bagel... You got it? ...that one from Purring Cobra, as we cruise into the night with news at 8:00, here on the home of Rock and Roll, 104.2. For those of you just tuning in, as part of our annual 104.2 Rocktoberthon, we have with us in the studio the lovely, the psychic, Ally Wilson, owner and operator of Divine Readings in New bury, here to talk about all things spooky. Mm, yeah. ...to help you guys out with that. Just to clarify, what I do is definitely not spooky. I offer people a way to seek answers, that's all. There's nothing spooky about it. I've had some tremendous success stories with my clients the past couple of years. Hey. Hey. You, uh... You got a second for me? Uh, I'm gonna be done in five minutes. Okay. No problem. Is everything okay? Yeah. Late night, tired of work, kids are asleep. No problem... You're so talkative tonight. - Hm? - What do you want me to say? Maybe, "Can I see the 'too that you did? Can I see the tattoo that you did? Yes, you can. Okay. Here it is. Okay. Just a sec. It's so cool. Look. It's about 1974 when I built that barn. I was out in the cornfield about 8:00 that October. Sun was goin' down. My wife had just gotten this black and white cat as a gift, and the damn thing got out of the house on me. She was gonna be mad, so I chased him around the cornfield for a while, and I saw this hole in the ground. Some farmers believe that these portals to the Other world opened up on Sam ha in, which we know today as Halloween. Hey, Benny, what you got, four today? Yeah, I got four. How about seven even? - Here you go. - All right. - Thanks, Benny. - Gotcha. I need my propane tank filled. I'm sorry. What? I need my propane tank filled. Yeah, uh... we, uh... Well, we don't do refills but, uh, I'd be happy to swap it out for ya. This is, uh... This is a brand new one. What do I owe you for it? Uh, nothin'. Really. It's okay. Thank you. Hey, uh... you're, uh... you're Miss... Miss Tossi, right? - Yeah. - Um... You know, I... I just wanted to say I feel really bad about what happened to your kid. I mean, it must be horrible what you're goin' through. I... I mean, I can't even begin to imagine what... What something like that feels like. But, uh, you know, if... if there's ever anything I can do to help, - I'm always here at Tony's. - Thank you. All right? Uh, you know, by the way, I'm Nick. Claudia. Okay, well, have a good one. I'll be right with you, buddy. - Hey, Rigs! - What? Did you leave a pumpkin out here? What? Hey, doc, it's, uh, Nick Palazzo. Uh, sorry to be calling so late but... I think I'm having an issue with my medication. If, uh, you could please call me at your earliest convenience, uh, back at this number, I'd appreciate it. Uh, it's really important. Thank you. Goodnight. Fucking talking for five hours, and she's... and I was, like, working, you know? I'm, like, doing my job and I cannot concentrate. Oh... so exhausting. What's wrong? Hm? I just got a lot on my mind right now. Like what? You know, just work shit. You work in a fucking deli. And what's that supposed to fuckin' mean? Oh... What, making all those turkey club sandwiches is stressing you out? What, you guys are worried that you will run out of prosciutto? We have plenty of prosciutto around here, though, baby. - You do? - Mm-hmm. Uh-huh? Mm-hmm? Gotta pee in the cup? Yeah, brother. Gonna pass? God, I hope so. Ah, don't worry about that shit. They don't care about that here. Really? Yeah, a buddy of mine peed in a cup for me. Oh. If you want, I can get some clean urine. You know what? I'll, uh... I'll keep that in mind. - Thanks, man. - No problem. - Have a good one. - Yeah, you too, man. Thank you. So tell me what's going on? Yeah, you know, it's like, uh... like my vision is off. Like double vision? Blurred vision? Blurred vision. Yeah, yeah, there you go, that's it. - Blurred vision. Okay. - Ho! - Most likely it's... - What's goin' on, lover boy? ...really common for patients over 40. Any trouble hearing? Yeah. I got a ringing in my ears, too. And... And it hurts but, you know, I... I don't know what it is. Ringing in your ears? I'm gonna send you to radiology. - Yeah, I think... - To get a better idea. - Is next Tuesday good? - Okay, great. Yeah. - Uh, Tuesday's good. - 2 p.m. work? - 2:00 is good. - Great. I'll set it up. Okay, great. Thanks, doc. Uh, I appreciate it. - I'll see you then. - My pleasure. - Speak soon. - Okay, bye-bye. Bro, you're killin' me. I'm on the phone. What's goin' on, lover boy? You get the job? Yeah, I, uh... I took my drug test this morning. Eh. You're a fuckin' monk now, so you should be fine. Remember the night before my drug test? Pete's house? Remember with the Bahama Mama? And we got wasted. I think I drank, like, a gallon of water that morning. I took one of those holistic detox cleanses. No idea how I passed. I'm, uh... I'm happy for you, bro. Look. We got another playoff game this we... weekend. Come on, I could use your bat. Bro, bro, I got way too much shit goin' on. What? Makin' bacon, egg and cheeses? Seriously, bro. Look. Look. Come to the game, and after, we'll go to Teasers. Yeah, well, right there, that's enough for me not to want to go to Teasers. Come on! Let's go, Pete! Let's go, Pete! Gettin' old, my man. Your body's breakin' down on you. That's all it is. Don't stress out about it. As long as you can get it up and keep it up, you're healthy in my book. Here's to crazy fuckin' redheads, and blow jobs from the left side. You don't have a beer, man. Have one. - It's a good night. - I'm good, buddy. Come on, come on. Have a beer. - I'm good. - What's your... Do you want a shot? Have some Jameson's. I got a shot. Really, man, I'm good. Really. Are you? - Are you really? - Yeah. Are you actually fuckin' good, or are you fuckin' full of shit? - One drink? - No, are you good? - I'm good. - Yeah. If you're good, then have a fuckin' drink with your friends. Hey, Nick! Come on in. So this is the section that we first were talkin' about. This is the production section. All right? So it's probably a good idea just to kinda get acclimated with the people who work down here because, I mean, eventually you're gonna get to this section here and they're gonna be the ones that'll be training you, all right? There's a lot of heavy machinery in here so you gotta be careful. There's a lot of noise. You gotta watch your feet. You gotta watch your fingers, watch your hair. I'm gonna take you down over this way. - Nick, this is Bert. - Nick, good to meet you. Bert's gonna be the guy that's gonna train you, stick by your side. Everything you need to know you'll learn from him. - All right, thanks a lot. - Hey, no problem. Do you have any experience in plastic injection molding? - No, first time. - Okay. For me, if the pitch weaves outside... You know, we love those inside pitches. That is 349 on the inside. But that's the nominal average shot. 217 on the outside corner. What do you think? Yeah, uh... - Here we go. - Oh, oh, we're back. Could everybody stand a little bit to the left? Just... Okay. A little bit more. No, no, no. That's enough. Okay, perfect. You guys are doin' really good. Thank... Looks great. You guys did good. A little bit to the left. Okay. Awesome, and smile. Almost a year ago today, we lost one of our own. Jacob was a vibrant child. He loved to play soccer. He was a member of the local Boy Scout troop. And he played Little League right here at this very location, which is why we are now dubbing this Jacob Tossi Memorial Field. Hey. What are those? You, uh, playin' poker or... That... I think that was a really beautiful ceremony today. Yeah. Nick, right? Yeah. You remembered. Could I uh... uh... Could I have one of those? Do, uh... you think they're gonna find him? They say they're close to finding him. But they've been saying that since day one. Honestly, I think they're just saying that to brush me off. I guess now I'm a political asset. Can I, uh... Can I ask you something? Yeah. Do, uh... Do you think somebody did this? What the fuck is your problem? - What? - What is wrong with you? I think you need to give me some space. Now. I'm sorry. Really. I don't know how it's fuckin' even possible. So I'm like, was it someone that looked like me? Maybe he was drunk and mistook someone else for me. He said that he could pass for me 'cause my buddy, Mike... Hey! Hey, kid! Hey! Hello! Have you been sleeping well? You know, doc, as well as can be expected given the circumstances. Do you exercise? Yeah. Almost every day. How's your stress? Uh... pretty high. It's probably a stress related issue. Here's an information packet for you. It's not uncommon for people with elevated stress levels to go through this. Do something about it. Otherwise, these episodes are gonna keep happening. - Okay? - Okay. Sounds good. Thanks, doc. Hey. I, uh... I just wanted to say I was... sorry about before. Uh... I... I bought you some pastries. Uh... I... I didn't mean to offend you, you know, if... if I did. I'm, uh... I'm, uh... I'm gonna go ahead and put these right here for you. Okay. I, uh... I asked someone, and they said that you... You worked here in town, and... uh... I figured I'd stop by. Uh, like I said, I... I... I just felt really bad. That's fine. I guess I was being too defensive. Do you mind grabbing that box for me? Uh, yeah. Sure. This, uh... This place is great. I've never been in here before. It's probably gonna close this year. - Nobody reads anymore. - Yeah. Everybody's on their cell phones all day long. Like a... generation of zombies. Yeah. We used to play outside all day, but... I was an '80s kids. Me too. Yeah. You remember goin' outside all day and playin' football, baseball. Just socializing, talking. Nowadays, everybody's so damn sensitive. - Bunch of pussies. - Ohh... You said that, I didn't. Everyone likes to cast rocks now, but nobody likes to look in the mirror. Wow. That's a... That's a really good philosophy. Is, uh... Is that one yours? Yeah. - I think so. - It's like, uh... Unless I read it somewhere and I forgot. Well, uh... I just wanted to, uh... you know, stop by and... tell you again how sorry I was, um... I didn't mean to offend you and I felt really bad. Well, I got some pastries out of it, so... Oh, yeah, yeah. Good. Good. Okay, well, uh... I, uh... I have some other things I gotta do here in town, but once again, I... I am really sorry. Um... Yeah. Okay. - Have a good one. - Thank you. In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Amen. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Should I, uh... Should I just, like, talk or... If you want. I've, uh... I've been having these visions. Visions of what? Pumpkins. Um... pumpkins? Yeah. Pumpkins. Uh, you know it's gonna be Halloween soon. Maybe you're, uh, just excited. When it happens, I, uh... I feel like I can't breathe. Mm... Like I'm being suffocated. That feeling of falling, you know? Like, uh... Like I'm dropping into a never-ending hole. You ever hear anything like that, Father? No, no. I... Last year... on Halloween... I hit a kid with my car. What's gonna happen to me? You've committed a mortal sin. One of the worst kinds. It is just... that you suffer. Where is the boy now? Somewhere in the woods, I... I don't... I honestly don't remember, I don't know. But I'm... I'm not that same person anymore, Father. People... People just don't understand. God... unlike man, has the capacity... to forgive even the worst sins. If you truly repent. In order to find absolution... you have to commit an act of perfect contrition. Well, what... what's a perfect act of contrition? Only you, my son, can find this task. Anything else I might help you with? Um... Yes, I'd like to access my safety deposit box, please. Certainly, one moment. Why you gettin' rid of this? I gotta help someone out. Look, Nick, I can give you four for it. Four? It's worth 25,000. I don't have 25,000, I have four. Come on, it's all I got left. Championship ring, Cyclones. I mean, nobody has that. Who would want this? Rocco, we both know I have plenty of fans. Look, Nicky. I always liked you, you always treated me good. I know your dad. I'm stretchin', but I can give you five for it. - Seven. - Five. - Six and a half. - Nicky, five. That's it. What are we eatin' tonight? Salad and there's a salmon in the oven. Salmon. - Nice. - Can you, by the way, turn him off. That's done. What's for dessert? What's for dessert? I don't know. Oh, fuck. Oh, no! No, no, no. Jeez... Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Nick, what did you do? Oh, my God, no. Fuck! God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! My God! 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Uh... s... someone's been hit by a car and they're... They're layin' on the side of the road. Where are you? Where are you? Sir? I'm, uh... I... I'm sorry, it's, uh... It's not a person, it's... It's just a deer. Nick. - Oh, shit. - Nurse, he's awake. - Oh, shit. - Nick. Hey. - What happened? - Hey. - Hey, baby. - What happened? Shh. Look at me, I'm here. - It's okay. - What happened? Hey, please, baby, just relax, okay? I'm here. Something's gonna happen. What are you talkin' about? I'm almost there. What, are you smokin' hashish now? This is not all we're meant for. You know, there... there's more... More out there. I saw it. Just for a second. But it was like somebody pulled back the curtain to reality, and I could see what was behind it. It was beautiful and... And terrifying. So I... I've been having these experiences, you know? And at first I was afraid, but now... Now I embrace them. I understand what they've been trying to tell me. The door is opening. And for the first time in my life... I have hope. Hope for what? Hope. What are you talkin' about, fuckin' hope? Man, you know, you really are one of the simple ones. Nick. Did you do this? Uh... I did. What is this? Honestly, it's nothing. This is too much. No, it's... It's for your foundation. I... I can't accept this. It's for the foundation. Do you believe in fate? Do you? Sometimes. Wh... What... What do you mean? Um... Let's just say that... after Jacob disappeared, I've... sort of opened myself up to different possibilities. Like what? After you've waited by the telephone for days and... days and days, just waiting for some information... for... your son to... somehow just show up unharmed. There's a moment when hope starts to fade away. And something else appears in its place. This universe is not what we think it is, Nick. Take Halloween, for instance. Halloween used to mean something different. At least in this area. It was called Sam ha in. It was the night where, the veil of reality got lifted, and the sacred world got revealed. We're so close to that realm but... people just seem to have forgotten about all that. They don't realize that the universe has endless possibilities. Those probabilities you mentioned, a tiny change in one of them can create a completely different world. Hell, there's probably another world out there where... Jacob is... I don't know. Living with his father. Claudia! Claudia. Are you okay? What's wrong? Yeah. I need to talk to you. There's, uh... There's something I... I need to do, and... you're not gonna see me anymore. Where are you going? I honestly don't know. I want to show you something. This is how I find my answers now. Pick three cards. The Hanged Man. The Fool. The Hierophant. So, uh, what does all that mean? There's something in your life for which you should be judged. This transgression overwhelms you. You need to come to terms with it to find peace. Something holds you back. You fear the unknown. You're stuck. So, what did you do? Hey, baby. I'm finishing up here. I, uh... I came to tell you that I'm leaving. And you won't see me anymore. Where are you going? There's something important I have to do. Like what? I have to go into the pumpkin hole. Can you please just take five minutes? - Oh, yeah. - Thank you. This looks so sick, by the way. Excuse me, bro. Excuse me. I mean, what the fuck is the pumpkin hole? You were always kind to me. Did I ever tell you about this... This dream that I had? Your mom was in it. You never met her. I know but... she was... she was there. Actually, we were in her place. She made us some food, we had some ice cream, and, uh... We went for a Halloween party, it was Halloween. We were wearing matching costumes. I know. I know it's stupid but... there was something sweet about it. Well, I guess in another life, right? By the time you read this, I'll already be gone. An opportunity presented itself to me. - Hey, Mom. - I'm making some fresh Pomodoro. - Want some pepper in it? - Yeah, just a little. There. Sit down. - You want a soda? - Yeah. - Here you go. - Thank you. You got a game later, right? Yeah, in about an hour. Here, start with this. - Want more soda? - Yeah. So, how's everything? - Is everything okay? - It's fine. Anna called. What'd she say? She wanted to know where you were last night. She's so nice. I really like her. Don't screw it up. - Here you go. - Okay. - You want cheese? - Mm. That's good. How is it? It's good. Got the tomatoes at the market. It was $20 for a big crate. You can't beat that, right? No, you can't. They also had those big boxes of granola. So I bought a... On sale. So I bought a few of them. We have granola for three months. That's awesome. And I changed all your bedding this morning. Thanks, Mom. Right now, you remind me of when you were a kid. With the suit and the little bow tie. You looked like a skinny little Frank Sinatra. Here. Take out the trash, will ya? Where I fucked up was, though, I told her to drop me off right in front of the house. - Oh, no, no. - Round the corner. - Bad move. - Rookie. Rookie mistake. And who's there? Anna's there. I see her car and all, and I'm like, "Fuck, what am I doin'?" So we pull up, she sees the headlights, sees the girl in the car, sees me get out, mind you, staggerin' out. I can hear her yellin' before I can even get inside. So you don't say right there she's an Uber driver? - I should have said that. - I got a ride home. You've been in this situation before. - Listen to what I told her. - You are correct. So I get in the house, I open the door, she's buggin' out. "Fuck this! Who the fuck is that? "What's that bitch doin'? What are you doin' with that bitch? Hope you know... "The whole nine. I say, "Hey, hey, relax. That's Bobby's girlfriend." See, that is when you... That is when you move for the threesome. Yeah. Is your wife down for that? - Not with you. - She want a little bit of the Italian Stallion, baby? With anyone else here, but not with you. Yeah! Hey, Mr. Henry! Hey, Babe Ruth, what's goin' on? Oh, you know, just a little bit of softball. That's you, boy. We do for you tonight, man? Uh... let's do... let's do three cards tonight. Guaranteed winner on there someplace, man. Man, you've been tellin' me that for years. And I keep buyin' it, too. It's gonna happen one of these days. Yeah, killin' on Fantasy this week. Oh, yeah? Who'd you have? Like QB on Dallas. Shit, I wish I'd took him. He's been on fire - these last few weeks. - He's been unbelievable, man. Not like your Jets quarterback. Dude, I keep bettin' with my heart instead of my head. That's what we all do. Hey, what's up, fellas? How you doin'? - Happy Halloween. - Likewise. - What can I do for you? - You guys, uh, got tuna fish? - Yeah, yeah. - Cool. I'll take one tuna fish on a roll, and Jacob, what do you want? Come on. Tell the man what you want. - Sorry, he's a little shy. - Take your time, bud, it's all right. Hey, what do you play for, the Yankees? - He's a baseball player for Halloween, yeah? - Yeah. Nice. You look like you're about hittin' like 350, 40 home runs, potential MVP. Little Cooperstown in your future. Tell you what, uh, any candy you want's on me, if it's okay with you, Dad. Thank you. What do you say? - Thank you. - All right. Yeah, you're welcome. - Anything you want, buddy. - Whatever kind you want, all right? Ah, good choice. I'd have done the same. Jacob, what do you want to eat? Bologna sandwich? Yeah? And one bologna sandwich with mayo, please. - Also on a roll? - Yeah. You got it. You gonna eat all this candy? Put those in your pumpkin if you want, pal. There you go, bud. Put 'em in your pumpkin. - Anything else? - That's it. You got it. Hey, Angelo. What's up? Well, I was, uh... I was supposed to see Anna tonight, but, um, you know, I can see if I can get out of it early. Yeah, I don't have any but, uh, let me make a phone call, all right? All right, cool. Hey, Ma! Holy sh...! I don't know. The letter didn't say anything else. It said that he did it. That he killed Ja... That he killed Jacob. That he killed him. That's what it said. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. What the fuck! When I was in college, I remember going to my cousin's wedding. She was a little bit older than me. She met this guy, they dated for a few years and then they got married. After two years, they saved up enough money to buy a house. Shortly after, they had a kid. And they named him after his dad. Joseph, Jr. Now... Joseph is 13. He's an average kid. Not too bright. Not too dumb. He's okay at sports. Every Friday night, they eat pizza. Last year... for Joseph Jr.'s birthday... they bought him a touch screen laptop. And for Christmas... a video game console. Where's my pizza Fridays? Jacob? Who are you? I'm Nick. What are you readin'? A story of a pumpkin. A pumpkin? Yes, a pumpkin. What's it about? Billy chases it into the woods, it goes down a hole and takes him to Halloween world. Do you want to see? Jacob, you're home. How's your ice cream? I'm sorry, what's that? Are you okay? I don't know, A. I just felt like I was somewhere else for a second. Are you ready to go? Yeah. Oh. We're so cute, baby. Huh? Yeah. I think so. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Hey. Should we go to the city? Anywhere but the city. I don't feel like dealing with the traffic and... To dance a little bit? You know how crazy the city is on Halloween? I know, but we are crazy, also. I know, I feel crazy in this hat. Does it look all right? - It's cute. - Yeah. Where do you want to go in the city? I don't know, maybe to Throxies? - They have great music tonight. - No, I know, but... it's already late. Oh... Do it again. I'll think about it. You will? You keep kissin' me, I'll think about it. I'm wasted. I think those last couple shots got to me. Yeah, me too a little bit. - Excuse me. - Hey, brother. Have you seen my boy? He's about this tall, eight years old. He's wearing a baseball costume. Uh, no, but what's his name? Jacob. Jacob. No. No, no, we haven't seen him, but we will... we will keep... We will keep an eye on it. - Thank you. - Yeah. I'm really starting to get worried. It's been a few hours. I'm sure you will find him. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Hmm. - Jacob. What? I don't know, just... I don't know. I think... Think it was the shots, I don't know. The city, huh? What... You got some sauce on you. Really? Uh-huh. That's good sauce. Good sauce.
