...rejected by the dictator of Panama, General Manuel Noriega. ...serviceman... ...contacted the... Let me tell ya, there's nothing more rock and roll than taking out the bad guys for the red, white and blue. But every mission had its price, and this last one was heavy. If there's ever a guy needed for a tough job, this was him. Becker. The thing about working as an operator is you come up against a lot of bad guys, fuckheads like this. Fuck! Off the record, his real name was James McLeod. Now let's slow this down a bit. I always knew where to find him. He's been passed out by his wife's grave for over a year. All right, Sam. Fetch him. Hey, sweetheart. Sweet, but undisciplined. But you'd know all about that, wouldn't ya? What do you want, John? I have an assignment. I'm not interested. Sarah's been gone for over a year now, Becker. Fuck. You spent that whole time agonizing over your guilt. You blame yourself, and hell, you're probably right. I mean, it was your fault after all. But if you're gonna commit suicide over it, just please, stick a gun in your mouth, get it over with. This waiting for your liver to drop out could take years. She died, John, because I didn't protect her from me. From what I do. She was innocent. I put her in danger. Somehow I cheated her out of her own fucking life. And I didn't get revenge for it. That's not true, kid. Not true. We tracked and killed all three of those... people. You don't get it. I needed to fucking kill them. - Me. - I understand. I get it. Luckily for you, providence placed the antidote not too far away from the poison. You need a purpose, I got one for ya. It's far away from here. Warm climate, sandy beaches, palm trees. Remember when you sold that tank lander with a sinkhole in it? Yeah, in Panama. Panama. Report to Nellis. 9:00 a.m., Monday morning. We'll brief you. Don't hold your breath. I'll be turning blue. Make it 10:00. Come on, Sam. Where are you? His sister-in-law checks in on him now and again. Probably the only reason he's still alive. At least I made you laugh, huh? Here. Drink. Do you remember that? We look happy, huh? You could use a shower. You sure Becker's the right guy? He's a Boy Scout, and we're sending him to a whorehouse. He's the best bullet catcher we had once. - He'll be fine. - I wouldn't call this boy a scout. His file looks like an international rap sheet. I've heard he's bullheaded and willful. He may question command. It's true. He has no respect for rank and pretense of any kind. - But that's a good thing, isn't it? - Then he might go rogue. If things don't go to plan, I don't want that blood on my hands. Blood on your hands? Are you sure that's not lotion? I wouldn't worry about the blood, Burns. After what you and I did in Vietnam, we'll spend an eternity on the meat rack. - Hey, Cyn, don't you have a flight to catch? - Gentlemen. - Buen viaje. - Gracias. - Hey, bro. - Stark. I'd like you to meet Hank Burns, outta SOCOM in DC. He's here to aid and assist where necessary. Let's cut through all the bullshit. What's your part? Already I can tell by your attitude you're asshole-validated. Forewarned, you're not the only US Marine standing here. By the looks of you, you're an 0141. - Were you in the fucking air corps? - And proud of it, grunt. Conflict! I love it. But we're here to work together. Gung ho, semper fi, all that Marine brotherhood shit. You know, all of that. I'll do my job, Stark, like I always do. Just keep this CIA wannabe away from me. Good. Well, now we're all buds, here's the deal. Since the Iran-Contra bullshit, Fort Sherman in Panama is the CIA conduit for supplying arms to the contras in Nicaragua. Noriega's become unreliable. With all the cocaine and Crown Royal in his system, we never know which El General we're talking to. Operationally, Panama's managed by Colonel Justines. We consider him a friend. He's very approachable. The Boland Amendment bars the US from selling arms directly to the contras, so the CIA is constantly looking for creative, cute new ways to fund them. Now, the first order of business? Buy a Russian chopper. All right? Now, Burns here is an expert in Soviet military equipment. Now, with your level-three clearance and user permit, you are the perfect guy to make the Russian chopper transaction. Clear as mud? No? Let me explain. There are some friends of Uncle Sam that wanna kill a guy, and they want a Russian chopper to do it, okay? Now, we like that they're gonna kill this guy, so we're gonna shell out to buy 'em a chopper. - Yeah? Who's selling? - Noriega. Fucking communist. He wants ten mil transferred to his personal Swiss account. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Nope. The contras want the chopper. In return, they'll give us Soviet weaponry and intel. So we're buying a chopper from Noriega and using it to kill him? - I love the poetic irony in that, huh? - I knew you would. It tickles the shit out of me. Our contact for picking up the chopper is in Panama. Now, it's gonna take a couple of weeks, so tourist visa ain't gonna cut it. - Right, so I need a legitimate job. - That's right. So from now on, you're a consultant for Casinos Nationale. Bump up the revenue. Reel in the suckers, okay? We'll help ya. Question for both of you. Is this all legal? Sure. Lawyers are okay with it. You gonna have a problem with this? You pay me, I act, Burns. It's a simple fucking deal. But you have opinions. - I'll see ya, Stark. - Yeah. Only good ones. There you go. Buddies. Look at that. Now, once you get settled, you'll meet with Enrique Rodriguez. His father was a former government official who died when Enrique was 12. He's very connected and Harvard educated. Marcos Justines is his godfather, his uncle, Billy Ford, who opposes Noriega in the election. Enrique is brokering the chopper deal. Now, we wired him a clean million as a deposit, but the dipshit probably spent it already. He's overly fond of blow and hookers. I'm Becker. Hola. I'm to drive you to see Señor Rodriguez. - Same place. - Okay. No, no, I got it. It's fine. Don't worry about it. - It's my job, okay? - Okay. Gracias. Señor Becker. Señor Rodriguez. - Pleasure. - Pleasure. - Sit. - Thank you. My friends call me Enrique. - I expect you to call me the same. - All right. What do your friends call you? - Becker. - Becker. What do your girlfriends call you? - The same. - Becker? Yeah. - Simple enough. - Yes, sir. - This is Valentina, my fiancée. - Mucho gusto. Mi amor, Señor Becker and I need to discuss business. Catch you later? Yeah? Kiss. Enrique, that's a lovely lady. A bitch. - So, you like this place? - Yeah, yeah, sure. It's nice. All right. Pablo. Leave the bags. - It's yours. - Thank you. Thank you. So, let's talk about the helicopter, shall we? Hmm. Later. I don't usually talk about business this late in the day. But we're going to have plenty of time for such a tedious discussion. Relax. Sophia. This is Sophia, my fiancée. I like it. Nice to meet you. Cariño mío, Señor Becker and I are discussing business. Meet you later at the pool? Come. Panama has lots to offer a man like you. Just settle in. Enjoy yourself. In time we'll make our deal. Drink? Shot of whiskey, if you don't mind. Cheers. Ah, Isabella. Man, I thought the '70s were sexy. There's nothing like the '80s. Isabella, meet Señor Becker. Becker, I am pleased to introduce you my fiancée, Isabella. Nice to... You're a lucky man, señor. - Welcome. - Yeah. James McLeod. What did you say? James McLeod. Nobody's called me that since high school. - Who are you? - Brooklyn Rivera. - Brooklyn, huh? - My father was a Dodgers fan. Yeah. You part of the contras or what? We prefer the term Commandos. The term contra-revolution implies we're trying to restore the government prior to the Sandinista revolution. We certainly are not. So are you here to discuss the chopper deal or what? I cannot make a deal without the consent of my comandante, Steadman Fagoth Muller. - Steadman Muller? - Steadman Fagoth Muller. He's very peculiar about how he's addressed. When he was a child, his middle name was the subject of teasing, so he beat up everyone who tried to make a joke of it and forced them all to call him by his full name. Yeah, he sounds like an asshole to me. - Finish your beer. Then we can go meet with him. - Yeah. Tell you what. Why don't we meet up in my suite in, say, an hour, hour and a half, all right? You don't understand. I have a plane waiting. - A plane? - Courtesy of your Department of Defense. Mr. Burns will be there. Man, I just got off a plane. Where are we going? Miami. We going to the safe house in Little Havana? No, not that one. You'll like it. Turn here. You know, if you're taking me to the safe house, Burns, you should probably put a hood on me. You were vetted. Level three. Stick your tongue out, please. Huh? I said, stick your tongue out, please. No, thanks. In Tibet, it's a traditional greeting to know if your visitor has evil thoughts. Do you have evil thoughts, Mr. Becker? Yeah, all the time. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. In America, we shake hands. - That's how it works. - Okay. A firm handshake, but not too firm. I like that. Sometimes people like to shake too firmly and try to hide something, and that makes me suspicious. Mm-hmm. Make you sound paranoid. Try and be nice, Becker. He's on our side. No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay. You say what is in your mind, don't you? - Yeah. - At least we don't have any communication problem. - No, we won't have any of that. - Yeah. - Take a seat, please. - Thank you. I hear that you want Soviet communication equipment. As much as you can supply. And in exchange? A Soviet helicopter. That's what I wanna hear. And what is in it for you? What do you mean? Profit. That's the only reason? Is there anything else? Papá y mamá. My parents. Sandinistas came in the middle of the night, woke them up and shot them. And my wife and my daughter. Noriega ordered them killed. The soldiers raped my 12-year-old daughter just in front of my wife. They shot them both in their face and threw their bodies in a ditch. I am blamed because I wasn't there to protect them. I'm sorry. I am. You see, it doesn't matter how many Sandinistas we kill. It is never enough. I have 3,000 men in the mountain of Rus Rus. And all they want is kill Sandinistas. They don't fight for democracy as your government pretends. They don't even know what that's for. They just want revenge. - Hmm. - For the same reason I do. I know, I understand. Tomorrow morning you're gonna go to Honduras with Brooklyn to our refugee camp, and perhaps you'll truly understand, Mr. Becker. Too many children here with their families destroyed. Why? What happened? Their fathers and mothers killed. Hola. You can sit next to her. Puedo? Gracias. They cut open my father's stomach and let him bleed until he was dead. And then told my mom we were free to go. When we started walking, they shot her in the back. I ran away. Then they told everyone she was killed while she was trying to escape. So how can I help you? Deliver that Soviet helicopter. Until then... help us kill some bad guys. Comandante. Mr. Becker. Okay. Vamos. You like rock music? I'm more of a Willie Nelson guy. - We'll make you a rock fan. - I doubt it. Welcome to the jungle! Hey, who's on drums? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. All right, go ahead. Quick. Let's go. Move. What the fuck are you doing? You just killed a doctor and a civilian. I thought you Americans hated Bolsheviks, huh? You sound like a civilian. I thought you were a soldier. This is your nurse? Look at your nurse. Huh? Perhaps this is your doctor. They would have killed you the second you turned away. So now you see the war that we fight. Huh? And bring me that chopper if you want this equipment. Jackie Cordoza was the biggest casino operator in Panama. I mean that in every damn way. - Señor Cordoza. - Mr. Becker. - Nice to finally meet you. - You too, sir. Becker, you were hired to increase the take at the Casinos Nationale. - Sí. - And the general here expects results. I'll do the best I can. I will. Well, please get to know the operation. - But a word of advice, Becker. - Yeah? - Don't look too deeply. - Understand. Good. How was your weekend? - Idyllic, yeah. It was the best. - Good. Excellent. Let me show you... Oh. Let me give you the grand tour. The thing about drug dealers like Enrique is that they always answer to someone with bigger cojones. And those McNuggets belong to the colonel. Colonel Marcos Justines, the second-most powerful man in Panama behind Noriega. Enrique, lovely to see you. Colonel Justines. Come in, please. - It's a pleasure to see you, Colonel. - Thank you. - Champagne? - Please. Please, come in. So... - You have plan for this evening? - You know me. I have plans every night. Of course. And it always involves chiquillas. Time to pay Cordoza once again. El Gordo? Yes, the Fat Man, as you call him. Do you feel like gambling? - Sure. - Good. He will be at the Marriott casino tonight. Hundred thousand. Make sure you lose it all. And here is, uh... Thank you, Colonel. The helicopter deal. I'll get my usual taste of that, I presume? A taste? You can have the entire appetizer. They wired a million down. And I will get it to you all in cash. All of it. Excellent. Tell me something. Will you torture this Becker the way you do all your customers? As usual, I will squeeze more money out of him than he expects to pay. And we'll both benefit from the extra cash, Colonel. Salud, Colonel. It's always a pleasure. Mr. Becker. You a narc or a spook? Narc. Sit down. - Do I know you? - You should. We can help each other out. What if I don't need any help? Stark thought you might. I was told you have a level-three clearance. You'd be a valuable asset to us. A lot of money passes through those casinos. I need documentation, and you're in a position to get it for me. What kind of documentation? Well, money is being laundered in a massive scale through the casino. I need the cage reports. I need to know where the money's going. Talking about drug money? What are you talking about? Oh, whatever it is or it isn't, that's not important to me. Let the DEA arrest the drug dealers. I thought that was the idea. We want evidence incriminating Noriega. The CIA is financing the opposite ticket. They're pouring in $50 million. Isn't that against the rules? Meddling with another country's election? My organization is working on the other side of the equation. We're building evidence against Noriega. You were saying how we can help each other. Doors will open. You can get me those reports, I can arrange for some cash to find its way into an offshore account of yours somewhere. - Tell me another way you can help me. - We have resources. Some day you will need me. It seems to weigh just right. The serial number on the .45 is a code. Memorize it. If you have a problem, call the office, give the respondent the number, we'll provide you with assistance. Cynthia. Now you're being helpful. Take care of business. Hello. Enrique, I looked up your gaming history. I gotta be honest. You're a horrible gambler. - Surely that's not a complaint. - Nah, nah, nah. I heard your drink of choice is champagne. Is that right? - It is. - Yeah? No champagne is complete without some chochas. - Mm. - I have a few waiting for me at the bar. Wanna join? Why not? Yeah. I will show you a good time, Becker. And about the helicopter deal, we can talk about it later. How come a guy like you is here alone? Guess I'm waiting for a woman like you. Camila. One in a million. Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy. That one you don't wanna mess with. - She's dangerous. - How so? She's connected to the wrong people. You know, Enrique, you like living dangerously, don't you? - Always. - Yeah. Makes you feel alive, right? - Yes, it does. - Yeah. So, let me live. I'm Becker. What's your name? You're drunk. Hmm. Yeah. But I ain't fucking blind. You know, you sure are beautiful. And you are a handsome man, but you're still drunk. Yeah, well, that can be rectified, you know. Don't bother. I'll ruin your life. It's already ruined. You are un poquito loco. Yeah, that is true. If you want a sane man, you got Enrique over there. Now, there you are wrong. He's definitely not sane. But at least he's smart enough to not hit on me. Well, I guess maybe I'm stupid then. - Yes, you are. - Yeah. I like stupid men. - As long as they are rich. - Oh, shit. Now we're getting somewhere, baby. Well... Well what? Shall we go to bed? Damn, you are sexy. Shh. It's only gonna work out if you don't talk, okay? Hey, hey, hey. Slow down. Ready for this one? Yes! Whoo! Whoo! When I win, everybody wins. And to make this evening more interesting... I'm all in. - You roll, my dear. - Really? Yeah. Excellent. Whoo! So now that I ran out of chips, we can go back to the bar. Huh? You ready for that? Yes? Come on. Sex for me helps to keep my demons away. - Sex and alcohol. - Mm. Show me your arm. Is that one of your demons? A gang back in Colombia. Well, you done with all that? That's why I move here. I used to dream, you know. I had lots of dreams. About what? About... running away with someone. Someone special. Oh, yeah? What happened? When I was 14, I was purchased by my patrón. I actually wanted to be sold. Couldn't wait. Because... anything was better than how I was living. My father ripped me from home and just gave me away in an exchange for two cows and 500 pesos. That's horrible. That was a long time ago. Don't worry. I have learned to survive by my wits and my body. My looks are just a commodity to me. To be bought and sold. A question for you. Am I gonna get a bill for this? I knew you would ask that. It's my day off. Shit. Baby, I could run away with you. You know that? You don't want to get to know me first? Shouldn't you get that? Ready? Yes? Becker! I heard you ride motorcycles. Is that true? A little bit. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna give you the thrill of your life in the morning. Since you insist on living dangerously. All right. See you then. Whoo! Hair of the dog, my friend. Today we test our skills. I have an obstacle course cut into the jungle. Let's see if you can keep up with me. I'm not into dirt bikes. I'm more into cruisers. You Americans and the Harleys. I would fall asleep in one of those. Real men go off road. Listen, if you win, you keep this helicopter. If you don't, I'll sell it to someone else. Deal? Drug dealers love the natural stuff, too... adrenaline. Never met one who wasn't a complete fucking nutjob. Don't feel so badly, señor. No one has ever lasted as long as you have. We're gonna be good friends, you and I. Nope. No, on the right side. Yeah. - Oh, fuck. - Sorry. Enrique's an arrogant prick. Yeah, but that son of a bitch can ride a dirt bike though. Hello. Fucking asshole. Goddamn. - Dónde está Enrique? - En el cuarto. Yeah. Enrique. - Enrique, hey. - It's only 10:00. Grab one of these beautiful women. You need to adjust your fucking business hours. Would you like one? - No, no, I'm good. - Glenmorangie. Eighteen year old. Single malt. Mm. So, what can I do for you? My understanding is they're selling the helo to another buyer. Is that right? - Yes. - Why? Because you lost the motorcycle race, Becker. Fuck you. - I'm sorry. - No, no. We paid you a million dollars in advance, and you cashed the fucking wire. Now, I'd like the money back, please. That was a nonrefundable deposit. Enrique, I don't do nonrefundable. I'm asking ya nicely, kid. And they say good manners don't cost anything, right? Okay, look. Let me make it real fucking simple for you. You either give me the money or I'll take it. Your whores down in the casino, they got loose lips. I know you got the money in here, so show me where the fuck it is. Yeah, he had it in a fucking speaker. I used to hide Playboys in a speaker when I was ten. - There's your fucking money. - Good. Good. Now you can go back to your fucking siesta. I hope you know what you're doing. We continue the struggle. - Anything you need, jefe? - No, Pablo. How's your beautiful family? Oh, they are muy bien. I love them so much. Well, I want you to go home. I don't need you until tomorrow. All right? Whatever you say. Thank you. Thank you. - Now, what's this? - It's evidence. Cage reports. It's what you wanted, right? It's exactly what I wanted. So, what can I do for you? I need you to get Enrique to sell me the helicopter for the price we agreed upon. Why would I play a card for a business deal that means nothing? It's not nothing. If you don't help me, then I'm just gonna raise some old-fashioned fucking revenge. - You hear me? - Oh, my God. Get over it, Becker. Okay? There's a shitstorm coming, and your helicopter deal is just one of its casualties. Don't do anything stupid. ...to defend democracy in Panama, to combat drug trafficking and to protect the integrity of the Panama Canal Treaty. Many attempts have been made to resolve this crisis through diplomacy and negotiation, to urge General Noriega to honor the clear results... Jesus Christ, what a mess. I'm gonna take the call in the bedroom, all right? Wish you would take me in the bedroom. After this call, I'll take you on the couch. Promise? I understand that Carlos and... - Hello. - Hey, how's our Boy Scout doing down there? - Getting pretty wild, huh? - It is. - Did you hear our chopper deal went south? - Yeah, I did. - Well, I got the million. - Hey, good man. Panama's about to explode. I wouldn't be surprised if we invade, the way things are going. I hope you let me know if they start dropping fucking bombs down here. Yeah, I'll give you a heads up on that one. Listen, Becker. The favor you asked of the DEA? I get it. But stand down. Enrique will be dealt with, okay? Stark, there's good people down here that need that chopper. Yeah, I know, I know. We'll help them when we can, but now is not the time. - Sir, this is the reason why I hate this business. - I understand. But the best I can do right now is get you a big, fat Christmas bonus for putting up with the bullshit, all right? So... you were saying something about the couch? I believe we were, yeah. Yes? Enrique. Join us. Santos. Been worried. My uncle was attacked. Nothing to worry about. He's in good health. Pure theatrics, mi chiquillo. A public relations stunt planned well in advance. Your tío is now a national hero. My idea. Why? I don't understand. Endara and my uncle are the opposition. If they come to power, they will not act in your interest. My friend, the prudent action on my part is to bet on both outcomes. Both outcomes? Okay. If America invades, Endara and your uncle take power. If they don't, Noriega remains. Either way, I win. I staged this event with the cooperation of your uncle and his advisers. You see, we need blood in the streets if we want to provoke an invasion. Meanwhile, we need to clean up loose ends. Cordoza, for once. He knows too much. And your American friend, in particular. I rather like Becker. Don't get sentimental. He's tied in with Cordoza. He works at the casino. We don't know what he knows or who he talks to. You can't trust Americans. He took my money. So get rid of him and anyone else close to him and get my million dollar back. And just like that, the colonel wanted everyone dead. Americano. Becker. The big corporate news networks are reporting the casualties are less than a hundred people, but that simply isn't true. There are scores of Panamanians out there dead, and there are more desperately seeking medical attention. And the government? The government have closed down all access to the hospitals. All of them. This is an emergency situation, and you need to leave immediately. So who can I count on? Oh, yeah. - Where are you going? - I need a smoke. Bring it back to bed, baby. You're not a human. You're a sex machine. You say that like it's a bad thing. Let me get a puff of that, will ya? All yours. Where are you going? - I'm going to pour us a drink. - Mm. Camila? Fuck! If you don't tell me who sent you, I'm gonna fucking kill you. - Fuck you. - Ingles, no? Okay. You know what? Here's the thing about torture. It's sometimes the most effective way. It's the simplest. Who fucking sent you? Enrique! Enrique Rodriguez. Enrique? Yeah. Really? D-9-1-O-4-0-5. Hello? I got a couple bodies at Camila's apartment. They need to be picked up. - Which apartment? - What do you mean, what apartment? She has two. One she lives in and one she entertains in. Well, I guess I'm in the one that entertains. She has another one in Punta Paitilla. You want the address? You look startled. Thank God you're alive. It's amazing how you can just turn it on like that. I mean it. Ask me if I set you up. Okay. Did you? Yes. The Colombians, they threatened to kill my family. It was either you or them, and I will make the same choice again if I have to. I'm not buying that story. I don't have a family, Camila. What a dumbass. But aren't we all? Amigo. Amigos don't try to kill each other. Are you mad at me? I know it wasn't your orders. Thank you for understanding. You see, this is just business. Your country's military will have secured Panama in a few hours. And then they will swear in Guillermo Endara as president and my uncle as vice president. You're uncle's a crook, Enrique. He's a politician. I choose the good life. The booze, cash. The pussy. Come here, honey. See that? That's a man's morality, my friend. The only god. The resurrection and life. Our refuge and strength. Tell you something, my friend. Get out of here. If you wanna live in the definition of your morality, then you're gonna tell me who tried to fucking kill me. - Can't do that. - Yeah, no, you're gonna do it. You wanna die, Enrique? - We're amigos. - Nah. You contradicted yourself. Sometimes amigos do kill each other. Colonel Justines. Marcos Justines. Thanks, amigo. Enrique? Colonel Justines. I, uh... I believe I have bad news for you. Becker's still alive. He was here. And somehow he knew that... he knew that you, uh... you ordered me to have him killed. No worries, mi chico. I'll handle Señor Becker. Come see me. Let's have coffee. Señor Burns. Enrique failed. No surprise there. But it presents an excellent opportunity for us to do business. I'm all ears, Colonel. Your compadre, Becker, has stolen from me. It's front money from Stark. One million. I would like you to retrieve it. Upon your success, we will do the usual split. I appreciate the opportunity, Colonel, but 50/50 won't cut it this time. Okay. You keep the money. All of it. But remember, you're in Panama. I'm in charge of the police and the army. Are you certain you don't want some political cover for this caper of yours? Standard split after expenses. We know one of Becker's weak points. She's in Panama. Good. Good then. After you retrieve my cash, drive to your finka outside David. I'll send my man there in a couple of days. Not only do they want to kill me, they want the fucking million dollars back. - That's why they tore the place apart. - They get it? No, no, no. I hid it in a place they'll never find it. Listen, Panama's getting out of hand. They won't stop looking for that money. It's your call. You want to get out of there and come back stateside? Not yet, Stark. Okay. Stay in touch. I'm on my way. Okay, this is where I come in to clean it up. Camila? Fuck. Hey. Honey. Hey. Oh, fuck. When your father passed, you were still a baby. I tried to step in to fill that void left by your father. But so often I feel I have failed. No, Colonel. You were always there for me. I was so proud of you. I was so proud of your academic achievement. Graduating cum laude at Harvard. Getting your MBA. What happened? My mother died. It proved that life was like a candle lit in an empty hallway. She was a saint, and God took her like she was cualquier persona. How did Becker find out it was me who ordered him killed? I don't know. Don't lie to me. I'm sorry. You are out of control. Thank goodness you have no wife. No babies. Why, Colonel? I will never talk. What was in the coffee? Something to make this go easy. I can't move my arms. You're a good boy. This is bigger than just you and me. I will miss you. I will revere this spot in the garden... forever. Does it make you feel good to kill a woman? Hmm? Señor Becker, I presume. I'm gonna make you fucking suffer. Okay. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. I'm afraid this is a standoff, don't you think? We both have weapons pointed at each other. I think you should calm yourself, señor. Now... I'm going to make a call. The person at the other end may help you understand, okay? Okay. It seems killing Señor Becker just makes him more angry. He's here, and he has a gun pointed at me. Perhaps you should talk to him. - Put it down. - Sure. Please. Who is this? Everyone you ever care about seems to die, Becker. Burns? Your wife Sarah. You motherfucker, you. Camila. And now Tatyana. What are you talking about? Becker. Tatyana? What's going on? Tatyana? But you have a chance, Becker. A chance to save her. You piece of shit. We will arrange a trade. Give me the million dollars you stole from me, and you get her back. - Yeah. - Alive and in one piece. The fuck's going on? - You tell Burns to let her go. - Let who go? Tatyana! Your sister-in-law. What about her? Listen to me, John. He's asking me to give Justines the million dollars - or he's gonna kill her. - Shit. - What the fuck is she doing here? - I don't know. My advice? Pay the man. - Pay him? - Yeah. That's it? Come on. Let me kill him, John. No. Arrange the trade, get her back. Take care of him later. - I don't trust him. - He's an untrustworthy motherfucker. You're gonna need backup. I'm going with ya. - Last time you were in the field? - A long time ago. I'm rusty. You wanna be the bait or the hook? I suppose it is my turn. Make sure you hit him in the head. I was talking to myself. Make sure you break his neck after you stick him. Drop it. Cool. Been keeping an eye on us. Stark will take you somewhere safe, all right? I'm glad you're in one piece. Nice to see ya again. Well, it's nice to be seen again. You got a sense of humor about it. That's good. You'll survive. Want some chocolate? Rumor surfaced that Burns had been double dealing with the CIA payments, so their command has been tapping his phones for the last six months. Apparently, he's very tight with Justines. Burns is heading for Justines' ranch outside of Chiriqui tomorrow. There's a safe house about 500 yards from the ranch. He's driving, you're flying on a small plane. One of my guys will pick you up in Chiriqui, take you to the finka. I'll arrange for security to take the night off. Rest is up to you. I'll get the job done. This detail is essential. After you get our money back, turn the lights on. Ask Burns to leave the way he came in. Wait 20 minutes, then head to the airport. There'll be another plane ready to take you back. Mr. Burns. Sit. I've positioned a chair for you. You armed? No, but my driver is. He's in the car. With your left arm, swing the bag in front of your chair. Good. Now with your right leg, push it towards me. Now, as much as I'd like to kill you, I've been ordered to let you go, so go. Oh, and, Mr. Burns, one last thing. If I ever see you again, you're dead. Nice. - Should we bag Justines? - Not our unit. Your DEA friend has got all the information you gave her. She'll give it to Panama. Let them juggle the turds. Well, shit. Let's go find a bottle of whiskey then. No, no, no. Not so fast. First you gotta deliver that chopper to Muller. Then it's happy hour. After I deliver the bird, I'm going on vacation, John. Well, good. Good man. I have a question for you, John. Do you believe in redemption? Hmm. The question's flawed. Redemption implies that we've committed some kind of sin and that there's some kind of higher power that can absolve us. Both notions I reject. It's important you forgive yourself. I'll see you, brother. See ya, buddy. I gotta clean this shit up. Muller finally got his chopper. He never killed Noriega with it. Matter of fact, he never killed anyone with it. He took the high road. Rescued 200 families instead. I think he'd finally seen enough killing. We caught Noriega with his drawers down. Seized a shit ton of cocaine, cash and Crown Royal. Well, the Crown Royal didn't make it too far. And as you see, Becker finally got that vacation. Romantic walks on the beach, all by himself. Just another jerk in the surf.
