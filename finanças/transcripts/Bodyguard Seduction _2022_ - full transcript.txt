[intense music] are you ready for me? You look great. It's all about how fabulous you are, so it should be super easy. So, how's your love life? Completely uneventful. Oh, come on. Charly huxton's love life uneventful? You were voted model of the year twice. Three times, actually. You're the co-founder and ceo of your own fashion line. You're single, you're gorgeous. You're not dating anybody? I'm not going there. Dylan tanner? What about him? He's one of the biggest movie stars on the planet and you married him. We all make mistakes. [laughs] I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor about it. You've been divorced for 14 months. Yes. And in the process, completely reinvented yourself as a business mogul. Do you ever wake up and think, "ah, what a difference a year makes"? Honestly, no. I've completely moved on and I couldn't be happier. Now, singular sportswear went public last month and became one of the hottest stocks on wall street. Now, some say that you owe your company's success to the publicity of your breakup with dylan. Are they right or wrong? [mellow music] I'd say I was doing quite well before dylan came along. I'm sorry, you know I have to ask this. The producers push me to ask these questions, so I'm gonna do it one more time. The question on everyone's mind is, is there a new man in your life? What do you say? Well, you can ask me the same thing a million times. No comment. [sighs] all right. You win this time, but next time, I am gonna get that out of you. Mm, we'll see. [laughs, cell phone rings] that was great, thank you. [charly] before you ask, it went fine. So she didn't want to know who you were dating? Of course she did. A woman can't run a fortune 500 company without a man by her side. Lucky for you, there isn't one. Ha, your sarcasm is duly noted. Anyway, you're all I need, partner. -So what's up? -What's up is that godfrey was just in my office on a tirade about how you've been overruling him again. He's our lead designer, not you. Godfrey's a prima donna and we pay him way too much. Do you even know how much he's being paid? I try to stay focused on the big picture. The details are your department, thank goodness. Look, I hired godfrey because I believe in his ideas. I'm also the one with the fashion design background, not you. Look, when we started the company, we decided that I would be the face of the brand. Now if you or the board has a problem with the way I do things, you can force me out. Not while you control 51%. Oh, that's right, I forgot. Hey, we're a team, you know that. Look, all kidding aside, you need to make peace with him and you need to do it today. Fine, I'll pucker up and kiss his ass when I get back to the office. I promise. [lark] thank you. -Lunch later? -Ah, we'll see. I've got a lot on my plate. Well, I hope not too much. You're my rock, lark. [soft music] don't I know it. [intense music] [sighs] too blue, too red. Too--I rejected this design last week. Yes, ms. Huxton, but, uh, godfrey said-- godfrey works for me, not the other way around. Where is he? He's, uh, he's... Mindy, breathe. You're my assistant, that means you have permission to speak clearly. He's in your office. [soft, tense music] [typing] what do you think you're doing in my office? And that's my computer. -I'm so sorry. -I had to check a file. And you gave him my password? I didn't, I just unlocked it for him. He said you'd be okay with it. Do I look like I'm okay with it? [godfrey chuckles] I don't know why you're laughing. She's not the only one who's gonna have to dust off that résumé. You can't fire me without just cause. Without cause? You just threw every rule we have about privacy and workplace boundaries out the window. Oh, you want to talk to me about boundaries? That's rich. What was I supposed to do, just sit back and let you ruin months of work? I had to make sure you're not altering more of my designs -behind my back. -Oh, please. You are lucky all I'm doing is firing you, now get out! You'll be hearing from my lawyer. When you said dust off that résumé, did you mean mine too? Yes, yours too. [soft music] [sighs] [soft, tense music] [handcuffs locking] okay, guys, and cut. That's a cut for today. Okay, guys, we're gonna be back in five, back in five. Talent, get some rest. Get some water, guys. Great job. Okay, I'll play. [giggles] what's that all about, vargas? He's gonna run lines with her. Is she an actress? I don't recognize her. [chuckles] she's an extra, but I think she's about to get a speaking role. [soft music] -wow. -Hey. We just work for the guy, right? We don't ask questions. [intense music] [sighs] we need to talk. He comes back over my dead body. I understand why you got rid of the intern, but godfrey? The board's not gonna like this. Are you serious? The only thing that would have been worse is if they'd been screwing on my desk. You should have discussed it with me first. You're right. Mea culpa. Oh, no, no, you don't get out of it that easily. Admit it, you wanted to go in a different direction and this was the perfect excuse. Where is this coming from all of a sudden? All of a sudden? You've been fighting me on every major decision for a year now. -I'm on your side, you know. -That is so not true. Yes, it is. I am the co-founder of this company. And yet you make me feel like I'm just another one of your flunkies. That's ridiculous. Why are you taking this so personally? What godfrey did was unforgivable and you know it. He was going through all my personal messages and emails. Now I don't mean to sound harsh, but can you please just do your job and find somebody else? [soft, tense music] [employee] graph b shows our earnings over the last quarter. As you can see, the be singular campaign is still generating strong sales and awareness for us across all major demographics and product lines. And when does the new campaign drop? It'll be in major markets by the end of the month. Good, the sooner the better. Wait, this month? I thought we agreed on christmas. I decided to move it up. You decided? But we're a team. We need to build on this momentum, lark. We discussed it and there's no reason to wait. We did not discuss it. Come on, we all knew what you would say. You're saying it now. [lark scoffs] so my opinion doesn't count, is that it? You'll just pat me on the head and do whatever you want anyway? No. You know what, um, it's been a crazy morning, we're all a little tired. Why don't we just table this conversation until after lunch, okay? [soft, tense music] about time one of us gets out of here. I've been here since 5:00 a.M. So have I. Okay. So how do you want to handle this? Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors again? Okay. How 'bout we, uh, flip a coin, like adults? Because I know you probably don't have one after getting cleaned out at the poker table last night. That's funny. [laughs] rock every single time. Gotta learn to be less predictable, my friend. I might be predictable, but at least I can buy my own drinks. How many times have you bet everything on some crazy longshot, huh? What can I say, jonny-boy? When I'm in, I'm all in. For the record, you owe me one. [chuckles] hey, it's not my fault. Gambling is a disease, and I'm a sick, sick man, jonny. See you tomorrow, vargas. [soft, tense music] [woman] help, help! Somebody help me! [sinister music] [harvey] what the hell do you want? [jonathan] no one takes advantage of a woman on my watch. [grunting, panting] [soft, tense music] get control your friend. You're done, buddy. I think you just lost your job. No worries. I was plannin' on quittin' anyway. I just hope it doesn't cost me mine. [harvey] jonathan makepeace, get in my office right now. [crickets chirring] [soft, tense music] and graph b shows our earnings over the last quarter. And as you can see, the be singular campaign is still generating strong sales and awareness across all major demographics and product lines. [speaking continues, distorts] [sensual music] [soft music] [laughs softly] [peeling tape] [soft, tense music] oh my god. [sinister music] that's what was in the box. Charming. All right, false alarm, everybody. -Back to work. -You all heard her. Back to work? Seriously? That was a death threat, charly. Not the first one. No, it's not. That doesn't bother you? I'm a public figure. A few ruffled feathers are the cost of doing business. A few ruffled-- okay, look. You may think you're invincible, but you're not. I set up an emergency board meeting. I want you safe. [soft music] everyone is in agreement. We are very concerned about your safety. Well, I'm not. I'll be okay. I don't think you appreciate the gravity of this situation. Of course I do. You're worried that some whacko is gonna drop a safe on my head. Well, that's not gonna happen. And nine times out of ten, these are empty threats. There are other factors to consider. -Like what? -If something happens to you, what happens to our stock price? I'm aware. There it is, the bottom line. This is a business, in case you'd forgotten. It's my life. What do you expect me to do, hide out in my house like I'm some kind of prisoner? We want you to hire a bodyguard. [laughs] [soft, tense music] you're--you're serious. I appreciate the concern, but I don't think it's necessary. A bodyguard and a few changes to your routine, just until the police finish their investigation. That's not a lot to ask. I refuse to be intimidated by this nut, whoever he is. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a big day tomorrow. [birds chirping] [soft music] [tense music] [dialing cell phone] [phone rings] [dispatcher] 9-1-1, what's your emergency? Hi. This is charly huxton. There's a man underneath my car. I think he might be planting a bomb. [dispatcher] why do you think he's planting a bomb, ma'am? Because I received a death threat last week. [dispatcher] ms. Huxton, can you give us your location? Yeah, 528-22 loma verde. [dispatcher] 5-2-8-2-2 l-o-m-a v-e-r-d-e? Is that correct, ma'am? -Ma'am? -Wait. I don't see him anymore. Oh no. -I forgot-- -forgot to lock your front-- [screams, sprays] -oh! -I got him. -What's happening? -Send the police. -What the hell? The police? -Yes, the police. You're not going anywhere until they get here. [dispatcher] ms. Huxton, please describe what's happening. Ms. Huxton, I think there's been a misunderstanding. Nice try. I saw you under my car. I know what you were doing. If you move, I will spray you again. I was making sure no one tampered with your brakes. -What? -I'm jonathan makepeace. -I'm your new bodyguard. -I don't have a bodyguard. [jonathan groans] you do now. Lark embridge hired me. She didn't tell you? She failed to mention it. Do you have id or something? Uh, yeah. Here. Yeah. [dispatcher] a patrol car is on the way. Wait, wait. I'm fine. It was a mistake, I'm sorry. [dispatcher] what about the man under your car? He's my bodyguard, I guess. [jonathan groans] -are you okay? -No. Do you have some water? Oh yeah, the sink's that way. Sorry, I didn't expect anybody. I just gotta rinse this eye. [soft, tense music] [sighs] [cell phone ringing] -hello? -Lark. Don't you ever do something like that behind my back again. I know you care, but this was way overboard. I wish I didn't have to, but you were being even more unreasonable than usual. That's a matter of opinion. I'm sorry. Look, just give him a chance. One week, that's all we're asking. 48 hours. And he better not get in my way. Goodbye. [sighs] I, uh... Suppose I owe you an apology. No, no, no, it's my fault, really. I should have called ahead, let you know I was coming out here. I'm sorry. [jonathan clears his throat] first time with that stuff though. Yeah, first time for everything. [clears throat] I'm just glad it expired so long ago. It burns. I bet. -Good aim though. -Yeah, I thought so. [soft, tense music] look, I understand that you're not excited -about this arrangement, but-- -that's an understatement. But we're gonna have to work together. Temporarily. -What are you doing? -Driving you. The keys? Are you kidding me? Look, this isn't gonna work unless you let me do my job. Well, you're a bodyguard, not a chauffer. If you want to protect me, protect me. But I'll take care of the driving. Fine. [charly sighs] what are you waiting for? You to fasten your seatbelt. [seatbelt glides, clicks] [engine starts] thank you. If we're gonna be spending a lot of time together, we should probably get to know each other better. Well, I got the impression you wanted to get this done as quickly as possible. Well, you obviously haven't heard. [she sighs] I am not happy unless everyone around me is miserable. So... Ever taken a bullet for a client? Does that matter? Well, I--I just want to make sure my employees are taking their jobs just as seriously as I am. Look, once I commit to someone, I commit. Really? I didn't mean it that way. Well, I should hope not. You'd better keep your mind on the job if you want to work for me. Lark told me exactly what to expect, so, it'll be all right. That I expect my team to stay focused? Among other things. Oh, really? Like what? Come on, I want to know exactly what she said. Look, I'm not getting in the middle of some cat fight between a couple of one-percenters. One-percenters? You see us as bank accounts, is that it? All I'm gonna say is I've seen how ugly you kind of people can play, and I don't want any part of it. Starts by reading too much ayn rand when you're in college. Ooh, now the claws come out. Just so you know, rand was more lark's jam. I was more into vonnegut. Really? Me too. [soft music] [vehicle approaching] what are we doing here? This won't take long. Stay in the car. You really want to test me on this? It'll take 15 minutes, tops. Stay. [soft, tense music] [indistinct chatter] she asked about the payment plan today. I told her it was taken care of, but I don't think she believed me. -Thank you. -Don't thank me. It's a wonderful thing you're doing, ms. Huxton. Uh, listen, I have to get to work, but if they need anything, you let me know, all right? Of course. Like I said, 15 minutes on the dot. Who else knows? About what? Cancer. You followed me? Look, I don't technically work for you. I work for the board. I just don't want to get blamed if you suddenly drop dead. [charly sighs] your concern for my health is touching, but I'm fine, I promise. Sounds good. I lost my mom to leukemia when I was 15. Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I'm so sorry. That... Must have been terrible. All I'm saying is, if you're going through something and you need someone to talk to... I'm your man. I can't imagine going through that, but this isn't... [sighs] this is a personal matter. I just--I can't talk about it. Is that okay? Yeah. [sighs] okay. Well, I've got a busy day today, so I would really appreciate it if you could just keep a low profile. You won't even know I'm there. [engine starts] [bright music] I'm gonna need the code to the gate out there. By all means. Make yourself at home. How many do you own? How many what? Homes. This is it. Really? You're worth millions of dollars. Don't get me wrong, the view's amazing, but it seems a little, uh... Quaint? -Yeah. -Yeah. I like the energy. Which reminds me, how did you make it past the front gate this morning? I bribed the guard. See how easy it is for someone to get to you? I'll call the hoa in the morning and have him fired immediately. -Already done. -Wow. I have to admit, I'm impressed. Why? Because I take my job as serious as you take yours? Well, this has been very educational, but I am feeling quite secure now, so, if we're all done here... Uh, yeah, I think I've seen everything I need to see. [soft music] -uh, have a good night. -You too. [door opens] [door closes] [soft, tense music] -dr. Dankoff? -Can I help you? Um, jonathan makepeace. I work private security for charly huxton. I just wondered if I could ask you a few questions about her treatment? Her treatment? Ms. Huxton isn't undergoing any treatment, at least not here. So her cancer is in remission then? As far as I know, ms. Huxton has never had cancer, but even if she had, I wouldn't be at liberty to discuss it. So if you'll excuse me-- so, what was she doing here this morning? Who was she here to see? I'm sorry, mr. Makepeace. That's right. But you'll have to ask her that question. [crickets chirring] beautiful, baby, I need you to work with me, okay? [sighs] if you can just... If you could just do what I want you to do. [cell phone alerts] [typing] [typing] [dramatic music] [typing] [soft, tense music] mm. Yeah, I've got the selects with me right now. I'm heading over. We can take a look at everything. Oh! [liquid spills] -you okay? -Uh, yeah. -Here's your coffee. -Thanks. And don't do that to me again. -Do what? -You ditched me. I didn't ditch you. Yes, you did. No one knew where you were. Tell me something. Am I here to make your job easier, or is it the other way around? Men's room's that way. I'll grab you something to wear. [soft, sinister music] [knocks] you decent? [jonathan] yeah, come on in. I got you a men's large. [sensual music] that was fast. I'm impressed. Don't be, uh, it's what we do around here. Yep, these should work. Yeah. -Something wrong? -Um, no. Of course not. I'll get these cleaned for you and get them right back to you. Thanks. [sighs] charly. Hey, listen to this. Marine corps sergeant jonathan makepeace is being called a hero after saving three young women from a suicide bomber. Sergeant makepeace identified the attacker as a threat and used his body to shield the women from the blast. He's in stable condition recovering from severe burns to his right leg. -Wow. -He makes quite an impression, doesn't he? He seems competent enough. Not to mention easy on the eyes. Oh yeah? I hadn't noticed. Really? Well, if it weren't for our strict sexual harassment policy, I'd be all over that. [phone ringing] yes? [heavy breathing] hello? [man's voice] I'm gonna enjoy watching you die. [dramatic music] he's in the building. [dial tone beeping] wait, don't touch that. I told you we needed to take this seriously. You were right. [phone ringing] nobody saw anything, and if they did they're not saying. Well, maybe we should just fire the entire floor. Let's not overreact. We'll call the police, check the cctv footage. I'll get right on it. In the meantime, you should take the rest of the day off. Are you sure that's necessary? I am. Mr. Makepeace, would you please escort ms. Huxton home? Yes, ma'am. Look. For what it's worth... I know I've been taking you for granted these past few months and I'm sorry. [soft music] I'll make it up to you, I promise. [vehicle engine whirring] about earlier in the bathroom, I... Forget it, forget it. I just--I didn't mean to embarrass you. Don't worry, you didn't. [soft music] apology accepted. Does it hurt? Only when I walk. Nah, I'm just kidding. The doctor told me I lost so much nerve tissue that he could stab me with a knife, I wouldn't feel a thing. Not trying to test that out any time soon though. Look, 10-to-1, this is just a disgruntled employee but if it's not... Who else might want to see you dead? [sighs] you don't get to where I am without stepping on a few toes, but I can't believe someone would hate me this much. I did hear some drama about a designer you fired. Godfrey? No, he doesn't have the intestinal fortitude for something like that. What about a former husband? You know, the media blew that way out of proportion. Dylan and I are just fine. You sure? Nobody holds a grudge like an ex. Speaking from experience? Yeah. I am. That's why I like to keep my love life simple. No expectations, no complications. No one gets hurt. Yeah, I feel exactly the same way. Is that why, uh... [clears throat] captain hollywood was your last relationship? Who says he was? -The internet. -The internet. That unimpeachable source. Well, I will have you know that I have dated plenty of people since then. Define plenty. What, do you think I'm lying? I think you're just not telling the truth or you're stretching it-- why is that so hard to believe? I'm no shrink, but... If I were to guess, after your marriage fell apart in front of the whole world, you got scared and stopped letting people in. You think I'm scared to put myself out there? Let's just drop the subject. No, no, we're not gonna drop it. Why does everyone seem to think that I don't know what I want? When's the last time you were on a date? That's irrelevant. How is that irrelevant? Pull over. -No. -I said pull over. -We're almost home. -No, pull over now. [soft music] how's that for scared? Doesn't prove anything. [tense music] what, you think I just go around kissing all of my employees? No, I think you were just trying to win an argument. Wow, you really are full of yourself, aren't you? Where are you going? Home. Like you said, we're almost there, right? Will you just wait a minute? Just leave me alone. Are--are you crying? No, I'm not crying. I'm a ceo for god's sake. Yeah, sure, the sun is in your eye. Now you're making fun of me? No, no, not--not at all, not at all. Look, I'm sorry for baiting you back there. It's just something about you... Brings it out of me. Which is what exactly? Sure you won't freak out? [soft, tense music] [tense music] tell me what you really think. The truth. [engine revving] [tires screech] [gunfire] [tires screech] charly. Charly. Charly, can you hear me? Lark, I'm fine. No, the doctor said it's not a concussion. I really don't want to talk about this right now. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Bye. All clear. [soft music] [sighs] you should probably get some rest. I'm--I'm too wired to sleep. Where are you gonna be? I got a pillow in the car. -I'll be fine. -You just saved my life. I'm not gonna let you sleep in the car. Come on, get comfortable. You hungry? Uh, yeah, yeah. I could eat. I could get some takeout. There's a great thai place just down the street. Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. You know, we never actually finished our conversation. You were gonna tell me what you really think. Complete honesty, remember? Yeah. I remember. I'm still waiting. Okay. I think that you act like a tough-as-nails master of the universe because you don't really want people to know how much you care. And I get it, you know. In the business world, that can be seen as a weakness. Not a shrink, huh? Look. I know you're not sick. I know you were at the hospital to see someone, but you have no living family. So, who were you there to see? His name's ryan. He has osteosarcoma, bone cancer. His mom is actually an employee with us. But she made one little mistake on a form and our hmo won't cover his treatment. And you're paying for it. -Does his mother know? -No. And I want it to stay that way. That's very generous. It's the right thing to do. And I can afford it, so... I bet sometimes you feel all alone. [laughs] please. First I'm oppressed, now I'm lonely. You know, that's the ultimate cliché of the powerful, successful woman. You know, charly... You can deny it all you want, but... Still, you did kiss me. [laughs] you know, just because I had a moment of weakness doesn't mean I'm some lovesick maiden desperate for a man to sweep me off my feet. It's okay. I get it. I'm lonely too. Now, wait a second. If you think we're anything alike, you must be out of your mind.

He was her bodyguard. You mean the one I hired specifically because he's a screw-up? Son of a bitch nearly shot me. He hit your car. I was in the car! I don't know why the hell you had to hire him in the first place. Why do you think? To give our shareholders the appearance of due diligence and to deflect suspicion. [godfrey] maybe from you. What about me? You were wearing the mask? Yes, and sunglasses. It's only a matter of time. They're gonna figure it out. The security footage from the office has been erased, and the car can't be traced back to either of us. You need to relax. Oh, that is so easy for you to say. I was almost killed. Look, I did what you asked, and now I want what you promised. The money, the promotion, the stock options, all of it. How do you know how to do that? I watch a lot of those crime-scene shows. Well, then you know the people always get caught. Because they make stupid mistakes. I'm smarter than that. Good luck with that. Forget the money. I'm out. No amount of money is worth this. I'm gonna go home, drink an entire bottle of wild turkey, and try to forget this ever happened. Before you go, I need your help with something. Oh my god! What? Bullets can be matched to the gun that fired them. In this case, mr. Makepeace's weapon. It's like a unique fingerprint. No two are the same.
