My pals are my gang. "The Invincibles". Our base: the empty lot nearby. We have a blast there. Even if our soccer matches often end in brawls. - Not a foul! - Like I said! Our gang has an insignia. A cool insignia with all our initials. Penalty kick. A "free kick" is thus named because the opponent cannot hinder the kicker He's Agnan, the teacher's pet. He's the ref. He can't play because of his glasses. But truth is, we do fine with no ref. It's a free kick! My dad puts cheaters like you in jail! Rufus' dad is a police officer, but he arrests no one. Your dad's a traffic cop! That's not true! You're a cheater and a liar! Say that again? Eudes is strong, but soccer isn't his thing. It's boxing. Re-free kick! Red card! "Re-free kick", meaning? Two free kicks? Clotaire... he's the class dunce. You still don't get it, Clotaire. At school, he spends all day in the corner. After so many years, he got used to it. I'll do the free kick! Maixent is the fastest runner. And he loves free kicks. Game's over for me. My stomach's empty. That's Alceste, he's a barrel of laughs. His favorite pastime: eating. He's always hungry. You're torn. No biggie. My dad will replace it. Geoffroy's dad is loaded. He's spoiled silly. I'll also ask for marbles, a cowboy hat, and a new electric train. Oh yeah, Alceste... he may be funny, but there's something he really hates, and I mean, really. Wasting food. - No, Alceste! - Why do that? You're impossible, Alceste! Whose turn is it? I can't, I have glasses. It's my turn. I'm not very strong. I'm not top of the class. Even if I once was 4th in grammar which entitled me to extra caramel flan. My father isn't rich and I'm not the fastest runner. But when it's my turn, I never back down. Looking for this? It's the 5th time this month. What? You want the ball? Bravo, Nicholas! We're called the Invincibles. We can't be invincible for real, but one thing's for sure: we're inseparable. LITTLE NICHOLAS' TREASURE My father's profession is Mom? Mom isn't Mom-Mom. My hearing is fine. Already 7. Mom? Can you help with my report? Coming, honey. So? What's dad's job? - He works for Mr. Moucheboume. - What does he do for him? He does tons of things. He has an office, a chair, pens... An eraser? An eraser. Yes, for sure. What does he do with it all? Well, he... he... he fills out forms, with words, numbers too... I'd imagine. And with his eraser, he erases the words he wrote... to write other numbers. Here he is! He can explain much better. My chicken's waiting. Honey, I'm home! Hello, honey! Hello, Dad. How was school, son? Geoffroy brought a firetruck his dad got him. The ladder's amazing. Eudes couldn't play with it because once he broke Geoffroy's crossbow. Yes. So they got in a fight. Also, the girls' school principal came to see ours to borrow our gym. The girls' gym is being renovated. But our principal said no. And we're glad because girls at school, even locked up in the gym, would make trouble. Excellent news, son. Dad? Can you help with my report? Nicholas, I didn't have a moment's peace all day. I'm really tired. Ask Mom instead. Poor Daddy had a grueling day! Daddy would probably have preferred to do laundry, to hang it to dry, go grocery shopping, go home, realize he forgot the mustard, go back to the store, drop his jacket at the dry cleaner, and thank the Platemouilles for last week's dinner. But if Tired Daddy prefers to cook the chicken and set the table, rather than explain his job to his son, he can take Mommy's place. Your Dad's job? That's your report? So, listen... When I was young, I was talented for acting. If I hadn't met Mom, I may have become... But now, what's your job? My job. No school tomorrow? Moucheboume Inc. Hello, sir. I'll put him on. Goodbye. Thank you, goodbye. Barlier, could that be mine? Because "monsieur" has his own stapler? The blue one... is mine. Perfectly executed. Remember this. Good work requires good equipment. And is this boy a good pupil? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Just like his father! Good one, Malbain. Is this a good one? Mr. Moucheboume, hello. Hello, old chap. I brought my son along. He has a report to write about his father's job. Excellent. - Nothing beats on-the-job training, - That's what I told... Gentlemen! I have some big news. I've persuaded our largest competitor to sell his company. Soon, Moucheboume Inc. will have acquired Grifaton Inc. Bravo! Come see me tomorrow. We need to talk. Recess is over! Come on. Children, everyone get in line. Then he looks for a stapler. The blue one. They all want Dad's stapler, the best one. Because good work requires good equipment. Once he finds it, he attacks. - Straight as an arrow. - That's his job? Stapler? No. Does that exist? Come now, children, get into a line! I'm in my own line. Two by two. Know what an eclipse is? Yes, when the sun is hidden by the moon. No, when the moon hides the sun. Yes. In two months, there'll be a total eclipse. "Total", our teacher said. The next one won't be for 32 years. Wow, 32 years, that's a long time. We'll learn lots of stuff about the sun. The principal wants each class to invent an object. An object? Concerning astronomy. An object we'll make together. - Great! - I'm home! I have a surprise! Don't run, Nicholas. Here. Thank you. Happy Birthday, Mom! It was two months ago. What are we celebrating? Haven't you noticed? Now? Moucheboume is buying Grifaton Inc. Really? But there's more! He needs a managing director, someone rigorous, someone serious. Competent... And who did he ask? Barlier. Duparc? Not Dubroche! Standing before you is the Director of Grifaton Inc.! - No! - Yes! Congratulations, honey. Congrats, Dad. Director! Yes. With the salary and everything! - When do you start? - In 3 months, before vacation. So soon! With a little organization, we'll make it. A little organization? Yes, the move. Oh, the move. What move? Grifaton Inc. is located in Aubagne, near Marseille. The South! Wonderful, right? I won't go. I'll never leave. I'll chain myself to the fence. With Rufus' dad's handcuffs! I'll never move. Don't talk nonsense, Nicholas. And traffic cops don't have handcuffs. I'll lose all my friends! You'll make new friends. - Not like these. - Even better ones! Try to understand. I've always answered to bosses, to their assistants. Their assistants' assistants. To think that one day I'd be the boss... I can't refuse this. Come on. Trust me. It'll be wonderful in Aubagne. In Aubagne, we work! So? Wonderful, isn't it? I love it! Silence! No talking in Aubagne. Of course, Mr. Moucheboume! Nothing beats on-the-job training! Honey? Who else will take the curtains down? Yes, but we have time. Do you realize what moving entails? Wrapping furniture, clothes, plates Sorting everything. Packing crates. Finding a buyer for the house. Saying goodbyes. And then leaving. So, moving in. Unpacking crates. Unwrapping furniture, clothing, plates, while doing everything else. Come on, stop. We'll never manage in three months. Honey, calm down. You know how happy I am for you. But I'll never manage. When he offered me the job, I thought about you! You say there's not enough room here, that you're overworked. Think about life there! A big house! With staff to help you. Cleaning woman. Cook. Laundry woman. Laundry woman? Yes, almost! You'll have nothing to do. Come to bed. Ask for more time. Ask Moucheboume? Come on, honey... You won't? Fine. I'll do it. I'll write to him. Dear Mr. Moucheboume. As an experienced gentleman, do you really find it humanly possible...? I'll help you. I think I've heard that before. Last Thursday, just before you dozed off. No, I was thinking. I'll do everything you want. - Everything? - Yes. - The windows? - The windows. The market? Everything you want. All right. To start with, my mother will come for a week or two. Maybe three. Um... Um... Mom-Mom, yes. I'm leaving. We're leaving too. For the museum. I'm going far away. Far from here. I'm moving. For real? No way! Where are you going? We have to remove the "N" from our insignias. For the Viking & Sun exhibition, climb aboard! Slow down, don't run! Come on, hurry up. Get moving! My whistle. Move it! Clotaire, don't fall. He's scary when he screams. For the Vikings, the sword was the ultimate prestige weapon. This is fascinating. Wonder why only one side is sharp? I was just wondering! Chances are they're based on Germanic knives. Germanic knives had one blade. No way are you leaving. We'll organize a huge demonstration! - Yeah! - With signs! Are you crazy? Want my dad to club us? Come on, your dad's a traffic cop. Say that again! I know. I'll get my father to buy the factory. My father won't delegate it to a guy like your father. Why is that? He looks like an employee, not a boss. Too smiley! Bosses don't smile. They're serious. Show some respect! Come with me, children. Not too close to the cases. Not too close. And now, a truly remarkable piece. This gold pendant was part of the fantastic loot that Olaf One-Eye buried after pillaging our region. This is all that remains. The rest must be buried somewhere. But this jewel is irrefutable proof that Olaf One-Eye hid riches around here. Come closer. I have an idea. You won't go, we'll do a hunger strike. Oh no, Alceste! You all right? Not a hunger strike. 4th one you've misplaced this month, Mr. Dubon. I didn't misplace it. My whistles are stolen, Mr. Principal. A boy here, an evil kleptomaniac, wants to undermine my authority. Or else you lost them. Maybe you're overworked. This is serious, Mr. Principal. When a school whistle is stolen, the Republic is attacked. A no-good crook lurks here. I'll unmask him, come what may. You'll blow the whistle on him. It was a pun. Here. Don't deplete my stock. Go on, take it. Keep it calm! No shouting! Found your whistle, Mr. Dubon? Thank God. Because getting punished is better with a whistle. Slow down, children! No, slow down. Calm down! Calm down, I said! They're overexcited. Mine too. For their astronomy project, they decided to build a planet. Your kids come up with an idea? An idea? It's been a while. - It's already built. - No! Excuse me? I don't know how you do it. It's a matter of discipline. Teaching is above all giving orders and making sure they're upheld. Education is a combat sport. Never forget it. Come on! Let's fight. Yes, Maixent? We can build it with wire. Wire? Yes, very good idea. And you, Clotaire? How do you imagine this planet? I didn't review. There's nothing to review. How do you think we should fashion the planet? I know nothing about fashion. Sportswear, maybe? Miss! Yes, Alceste? We can build ourselves an enormous planet. Nice and shiny, with gold paper. You know, the kind they wrap chocolate bars with. Alceste... Do you realize how many chocolate bars we'd need? It's impossible... Be seated. We were talking about our project for the eclipse. Exactly. I have some big news for you. Since each class is making an object, I had the idea... pretty brilliant, to organize an end-of-the-year contest. I've named it: "Solar System / Scholar System". It's a pun. Good. We'll be inviting your parents. And we'll vote on which project is the best. The winning class will go on a trip next year to visit the Astronomical Observatory! I've thought it over. Your dad's boss must change his mind. And take back the job offer. Why would Mr. Moucheboume change his mind? My mom always says: "Don't touch the gratin until it's ready." This is the same. Moucheboume has to realize your father's not ready to be a director. Either that, or you move. Listen, as director, I have only one watchword: "International." Yes, Barlier, call my secretary. I'll see what I can do. Come on, Duparc, You're not lazy to the bone, but to the marrow! This is a workplace. Win the lottery? Manner of speaking. Don't get in an accident with a car like that! You can't parallel park without hitting the neighbor's car. What's that car? A director's car! A director's car? How so? Who do you think you are? You didn't know? Before you stands the future director of Grifaton Inc.! What? Full modern comfort. Power steering. Car radio! Not in here? Yes, next to the gear stick. No, Mother. Mother? You forgot to pick her up? Bravo! One smart director! He should have brought a brain, not a car! Manner of speaking! Why buy a car without the salary that goes with it? Men will be men. Anyway, he's trying. The pie's in the oven. Thanks, honey. My apron suits him, right Nicholas? He should always wear one! It'll be ready in 45 minutes, time enough... To clean the mirror. What? The mirror's perfect. No, it's not perfect. I kept quiet, but if this were my home... Well, you act as if it were. Honey. You promised you'd help. Yes, I remember. The rag's under the sink. I'm enjoying the calm before the storm of moving. I'm the one who's overworked, sorry! Grifaton arrives Friday. Moucheboume invited him to lunch. I need a development plan for the factory we're buying. Have you noticed how men make mountains out of molehills? I'm here, I hear you, Mother-in-law. Honey, there's a smudge on the left. I kept quiet. Son-in-law, would you mind making us some tea? Thirsty, Nicholas? No one here realizes how important this file is. If it's not perfect by Saturday, we can kiss Aubagne goodbye. Hurry! Moucheboume hates latecomers. The sadist who invented heels... Can you tell me why I had to come? You're not better off, just you men? It's an informal meeting, I said! He wants it casual, so Grifaton feels comfortable. Trust him. No one cares whether I'm comfortable! I'll end up in a cast. But if Mr. Grifaton is pleased... - Honey... - I get tense when it's stuffy. Don't worry. No one will ask you anything. Listen and smile. Most of all, smile. Hello, we're expected. The club restaurant. - Name? - Moucheboume. Of course. Their game is running late. Game of what? Tennis, Madam. I don't have the right shoes! Careful, match point. Hello, Mr. Moucheboume! Quiet, this is serious. Your serve! Mrs. Moucheboume! - Out! - No, on the line! Madam? Did you see the ball? The ball. Did you see? Was it in or out? - Uh... I... - What do you mean? You weren't watching? - Yes. - So? In or out? In. It was on the line. I was sure it was out. Nope. No hard feelings, Grifaton. Lunch! - I'm all yours. - Let's go. - Let's. - Right. He's not a gardener. He's a true artist. Loyal too. All of Aubagne wants him, but he'll never leave me. Lucky you! A large garden requires help. I know, thank God I have him. I just have a terrace, but it's a lot of work. I planted trees. Potted trees. I take them in for the winter. The next year, they were all dead! My poor friend. I don't have a green thumb. Has Madam decided? Uh, yes. I'll have... - I'll have the steak. - Excellent. How do you like it? I like it a lot. I haven't tasted it yet, but... it must be delicious. Cooked how? Excuse me! How do I like it cooked? How do I like it... Um... rare. Bottle of wine, gentlemen? Château Gadet '55. - Wow. - It's what I want! Perfect occasion. To toast our agreement. And our game. Exactly. Old chap, let's show our friend what you have. Right away, sir. The file is right here. Delicious olives. What's wrong, old chap? The plan, for God's sake! What the...? It's true, these olives are delicious. I'm sorry, my friend. I don't get it. Don't start thinking... Number 52! Where did you find it? It's been out of print for months! 52! I've looked all over for it! How did you know that I... Who told you? Well, I'll be! You couldn't have made me happier. He's good, isn't he? I don't bet on losing horses! You must come meet the employees! What would you say to a little trip down south? I'd love that. I'll bring you some more. This is excellent, but where's the file? Mom-Mom bought you a good game! Give me a kiss. What's wrong? -Your move. - My move? Nicholas! Where's the file? You want to kill me or what? There it is. Calm down! Put your Pilote in my folder? What an airhead! I adore you! Don't worry, Nicholas. We'll visit you in Aubagne. All of us. I don't believe you. I'll be too far. You'll never come. There must be a way to avoid this. Einstein says: "Question without answers are poorly stated." He tried everything! That's the problem! All he managed to do was persuade his dad's boss he made the right choice. When my cousin moved, he got a rash all over. His skin even started to peel off. He ended up in hospital. You're really good at cheering people up. Did your cousin die? No, he pulled through. But he just changed neighborhoods. Whereas you... I'm not a doctor but I'd say Aubagne... is a lot worse. When you're feeling down, you have to play. And I know what! Agnan, get the ball from the crazy widow. Good. Let's put it here. Come, Mother. - Where's she going? - To her son's. It's not easy living alone when you're old. So, since I got the ball, can I get my initials on the insignia? There was no dog, no crazy lady. It doesn't count! Next time I come to visit will be down south. Thank you, Son-in-law. Listen, Mother! He called today. He visited a beautiful home. With an enormous garden, a pool... and above all, a room for you. Yes. Bye, Mother. Goodbye, sweetie. A pool! He's sparing no expenses! Yes, Mr. Blédurt, a pool. Telephone! My husband always needs me. Yes, honey? - Hello, my dear lady. - Mr. Moucheboume? - Bad timing? - My husband isn't in. Yes, I know. He's in Aubagne for the week. I'm calling for you. Me? This may seem a bit strange. That tennis game the other day, the match point, remember? Yes. Are you sure you saw the ball was in? Wait... Come to think of it... A doubt? I... I have a doubt. Thank you. I hope I didn't bother you. Good day. - Goodbye. - Hello? Don't worry about your husband. If he follows my advice for the speech, he'll be fine. No numbers, nothing specific. Dreams! A good boss leads his men on a voyage. They need to hear a story. He almost became an actor? Yes, well, "almost"... He'll do fine. What do I hear? It's a seagull. A colony of seagulls! Circling the boat! The sea is raging. Lighting cuts through the sky! We can read the worry on every face. So, the captain... asks his men to gather. "Sailors, "we are confronting Poseidon's anger. "Fear not. "This ship will land safe and sound, "despite the storms and twists of fate, "because... "there is, in every one of us, "the most precious of all cargoes: "Hope!" Count on me. I'll be that captain, your captain! Well... Good. Any questions? Why are you here, Marie-Edwige? To rehearse. Want me to teach you? Dancing is for girls. As you like. I'm doing a glissade, but I need a floor to slide. The ground isn't slippery. A soccer field isn't for dancing. - We have no gym. - I know. They were supposed to build a new one, - but construction is halted. - Really? There are archeologists digging there now. For what? I don't know. They founds relics. They're digging with teaspoons, so the gym will take time. Something wrong? If I let you teach me to dance, will you do me a favor? I don't get it. Think it over. Why does my father want to move? To become the director. And why become the director? To make more money. Exactly. So if, right now, he comes across tons of money, he won't need to move. Farewell Aubagne! Listen, my dad has lots of money, but he never shares. Which is why he has a lot. It's not about him, it's about a treasure, that of the Viking, Olaf One-Eye. How will you find it? Come. Remember what the guide said? Yeah, I remember. There she is. What about the archeologists? She said they don't dig during classes. Where's Clotaire? You crazy? Why? It's easier for sneaking in. Take that off. Come on girls, hurry! Marie-Edwige did it! It didn't hurt! I'll do it to you, you'll see. It hurts! Go on, try! She pulled my hair. - Not true! - You dirty liar! Say that again! She pulled my hair! Marie-Edwige! You? You never misbehave! Move it! To the Principal, both of you! The coast is clear. Go on. We have 90 minutes till recess. Hold the ladder! This is too exhausting! Just one last effort! Who knows what the archeologists are looking for? There's nothing! Time to go! Wait! There! That's the treasure? A beer bottle? We really have to go. Where's Alceste? No fair, the girls' cafeteria is better! Strawberry pie today! No time to lose! Boys! There are boys! Did you get lost? Wanna play hopscotch? Look at you, not even a suntan! The new director looks pretty pale. And grim too. What? Future bosses don't talk to normal folk? Sorry to bother you, Your Majesty. There he is. Hello, honey. What's all this? Hello, honey. Hello, honey. What's this? What do you mean? We're moving, remember? In a month. We have time. This is a little cluttered. There's a flea market next week. Someone will buy it. Lots of commotion since you left. Come. Hello, son. Your son, today, did not one, but two very naughty things. Nicholas? He skipped school today. - On purpose? - You bet on purpose! That's very serious. Wait. All he found time to do with his friends was to sneak into... Where? Take a wild guess. The girls school. The girls school? Now this is very... Naughty boy. It reminds me of the time, with my brother Eugène, we'd left for summer camp. The girls slept in the dorm next to ours. - So one evening, Eugène... - Honey! Nicholas, tell Dad what you did. It's because of Olaf One-Eye. Instead of his treasure, I found beer. Beer? It gets even better. Now it's sure. I'll have tons of rashes and my skin will fall off. I'll end up in hospital. Don't overdramatize. Archeologist is a great job, a dream come true. The museum gave them ideas, that's all. They're kids. He's never done anything like it before. He's pretty unsettled. Moving is exciting, but it's scary too. A little, yes. We're both overwhelmed, maybe... we weren't there for him. Who calls so late at night? Good evening. Hello, Mr. Moucheboume. - Bad timing? - Not at all. I bet you want to hear about Aubagne. You'll tell me at the office. Old chap, can you ask your wife to put down in writing that little doubt she mentioned to me? A doubt my wife has? About? The match point. The other day. I'm going to ask Grifaton for a rematch. Clotaire! There's this nice lamp. All right, nice chrome finish. I like it a lot. Let's say 30 francs. Perfect. And it works well too. And this too. Not the ashtrays! Don't start. The real-estate agent was clear. We must fix up and empty out the house before showing it. We can't take everything! This kind man is buying our old stuff. I'm fond of those ashtrays. You're fond of everything! Know what I found in your closet? Hundreds of corks. Corks come in handy. Old sardine tins? Handy too? Those boxes are cute. Know what you are? A syllogomaniac. - A what? - Syllogomaniac. A compulsive hoarder of useless objects, who can't rid himself of them. You checked the dictionary for a term... Look, even your son is playing along. How much for your truck? 1,000 francs. Yeah, he's really playing along. Syllogomaniac. What will you buy with your 5 francs? I want nothing. Nicholas wants nothing! What on earth? Look at this boat! No, a Caravelle! What a gorgeous Caravelle. Gorgeous, isn't it? And not expensive. I have other models. This one is perfect. MY TREASURE HUNTS I want this! Great choice, My Treasure Hunts. Dad, Mom! No need to move! I'm coming! Dinner! Olaf One-Eye... Dinnertime, Nicholas! Coming! Have you lost something again, Mr. Dubon? They never go to the library. Except Agnan. Their first time here. Still hunting for your presumed whistle thief? This smells fishy. Very fishy! Don't pick bones. No bones, Dubon! No fishy bones... of course. It's a pun. A double-pun, even. I'm at the top of my game. So? I rarely translate Viking Latin. Their grammar is very imprecise. Here, for example, the word order differs from classical Latin. Yeah, but what does it say? "If you open the eye..." No wait. "If you open... your eye, the dolphin's eye will guide you." The dolphin? Are dolphins edible? These Vikings are crazy. It's meaningless. "Delphini" is "dolphin". I'm positive. "If you open your eye, the dolphin's eye will guide you." So... my initials on the insignia? Well, well! What are you rascals plotting? I was doing homework. They stopped me from finishing. Bag inspection! Gather them all! Not you. Bootlicker! Everyone else, obey! No initials for him any time soon. What are you looking for? What was stolen from me. When my dad arrests robbers... Enough! We all know his job. Calm down! Traffic cop! What did they steal from you? A dozen... My whistle. Sir? Yes? Are there dolphins in the area? Peter Dolphin - Hair Salon Not only were Incas and Vikings fascinated by eclipses, even the Kings of France were interested in the phenomenon. Starting with, of course, Louis XIV. Do you know Louis XIV's nickname? Clotaire? Me? Louis XIV's nickname? Louis XIV's nickname. Loulou? Loulou XIV maybe? The Sun King, miss! Exactly, Agnan. The Sun King even saw an eclipse. On November 23, 1699 in Fontainebleau. Just imagine. The entire court gathered for the event. The King, his wife, the Grand Dauphin, the Académie des Sciences... - Miss? - A problem, Nicholas? Louis XIV had a dolphin? Yes. Well, not a real dolphin. "Dauphin" is the title of the King's first son. The heir to the throne. How could I miss that? We found it. Thank you, miss. Think I can find a king's son nearby? The Dauphin! The King's son, of course! Stupid me. I was blind as bat. "If you open your eye, the Dauphin's eye will guide you." Open your eyes and look. Up there. Move. Maybe there? Get off immediately, you thugs! Rufus? What are you doing? Opening our eyes. So he'll guide us. Are you arresting us? I'm not arresting anyone. What did I say? Your dad arrests no one! Say it again! Rufus... Aren't you a traffic cop, sir? He arrests robbers too! You kidding me? - He found it! - What is it? Let's check this out. - Here's the city. - He's right. Oh yeah. And here is... Beaulieu Park. How do you know? I recognize the lake, the green-bean-shaped island. There's even the gazebo! That's not a birdcage? The 3 triangles. Olaf's signature. - Treasure must be there. - Yes! Olaf One-Eye knew Beaulieu park? - We'll plan our mission. - Sounds dangerous. The area must be booby-trapped. Maybe forest demons protect it from pillagers! I can't go. I have glasses. We need to gear up by Sunday. How will we get there? I'll ask my dad. THE MODERN BOSS Hello, Mr. Moucheboume. Meet your replacement, old chap. - I'm fired? - No, of course not. Your replacement here. When you'll be in Aubagne. François Kermarrec. So I'm counting on you to teach him the ropes of your job. Honestly, I can't do it for you. I've never understood what you do. Here. For me? You shouldn't have. For your wife. To thank her for her little note. Grifaton agreed to a rematch. This time with a real referee. Game. Set. And match! Here, a fork can be useful. I brought this. To warn you if you're in danger. Rufus? A slingshot! - Amazing! - My dad can buy me better. Can I try? - Only if we're in danger. - Look it's... It's Dubon... Now I've got you. You kept me guessing, rascal! All I did was warn them with my whistle! My whistle, young man. Now please give it back. But... it's mine. I bought it with the money I got for coming in second to last. Give it me on the double! No, it's mine. It's his, sir! Give me my whistle on the double! What's going on here? Mr. Principal. I found my thief fencing the goods. Show me what's in your hand? False accusation! Our whistles aren't plastic and they're not blue, even if they have a ring that lets you attach them to a string so as not to lose them. Clotaire did nothing. He never does anything. It's what he does best. Go and play. As for you, Dubon, stop falsely accusing these poor children. Truth is, you're just whistling in the wind. - It's... - A pun, I understand. All the points composing a circle are at equal distance from what we call "the center". The distance separating the center from each point is called...? Does anyone else know? Yes, Agnan? The radius, miss! Good, Agnan. The radius. The length of the radius is always equal to the diameter divided by two. The diameter is the line intersecting the center. Croissants are sacred! I aimed at Agnan! I have glasses! What's going on? It's Eudes, miss. He shot an eraser at Alceste. Rat! Eudes, to the Principal right away. Alceste, what's that? It's a croissant. Confiscated! Be right back. Stay calm. No biggie. I always have seconds. PARTICLE PHYSICS Rat! You don't know what you're in for! Eraser fight! Stop, you'll damage the planet! You left those animals without surveillance? You're completely irresponsible! They made so much noise I couldn't hear myself think. Excuse me, I'll talk to them. Explaining is not enough. It's time to punish! Or you'll be eaten alive. - Eaten? - Eaten alive, for sure. I'll punish them. For sure. It's inexcusable... Let's start over. The radius is the distance separating the center from the points composing the circle. Everything all right, kids? There. The gazebo! We made it! We'll dock on the other side. I'll wait for you here. I deserve a little nap. You need all that to build a hut? Shovels? Good work requires good equipment. Have a good time, kids. We're off! Off to the gazebo! Anyway, we're going the right way. Sure we're not looking for a birdcage? Just testing if it works. On missions, you need to stay fortified. I see the gazebo! Great binoculars! We see it too. We're not blind. We need to find the 3 triangles. All right. Let's look everywhere. Triangles. Like those? Exactly. So, triangles exactly like those... Clotaire... What? You found the triangles. What? Me? Impossible. I never find anything. I should have asked my dad for a bulldozer. We'll never find it. Maybe they were the wrong triangles. Or else I was right. On the parchment, it's a birdcage. There! I feel something. Dig, go on, dig! - A chest! - Dig around it. Incredible! This is it. Olaf One-Eye's treasure. You won't have to move! And we'll all go to the Observatory. I'll open it. And why you? Maybe you should let me. I'm more used to fortunes. Nicholas should. We found it thanks to him. What... What? Candy? If it's Viking candy, it must be past expiry. Don't worry. They found it! Congratulations, champs! Nicholas! World's best treasure-hunter! What? You don't like candy? You meant well. Your treasure hunt was great. I wish my dad did stuff like that for me. It took Nicholas' mind off things. You should have seen him. When I told him I'd planted that book so he'd find it, he ran away. Took an hour find him. This treasure hunt... Finding lots of money so we don't need to move to Aubagne... You have a funny son. His plan wasn't stupid. What would I have done with Olaf's treasure? Don't want to move anymore? Because we show the house on Thursday. Of course I want to. A promotion like this! You'd have to be crazy to... No? Yes, you'd have to be crazy. Yes. And you seem so happy. You're enthusiastic about everything, it's great. It's all ready. We sell, load up the truck and poof! Exactly. Sounds like... a grasshopper. A grasshopper, exactly! I'm getting you in the mood. I can pour you some pastis, because herbal tea, sorry, but in Aubagne, is forbidden by the law. We used to find it quaint, but after a while, it's annoying. Blédurt, now's not the time. I see. Mr. Director is not in the mood for play. Long live the new neighbors. Don't worry about Nicholas. His friends, school, their project, it'll blow away by tomorrow. Maybe, yeah. See how this eclipse thrills him? Did you really think I wouldn't notice? I was going to take you on my day off to see the eclipse. Out of the question now. You can go with your parents. Yes, Agnan? Maybe we can repair it... We won't repair it. That will be your punishment. You'll present it as is. Ugly and broken! And we'll finish last. I thought I could trust you. I even thought my job was based on trust. To make you responsible, inventive young men. I was mistaken. My mother's right. "That's not the right job for you, honeybun." Yes, she calls me "honeybun". "You're too nice," she says. She's right, from now on, I'll be mean and it serves you right! What, Clotaire? You won't be able to. I won't be able to what? Become mean. It's like me and spelling. Even if you try hard, you'll still be the nicest teacher. Notebooks out! Surprise quiz! Great! Conjugate the verb "to punish". I'm not here. I made them for you. To watch the sun without burning your eyes. Come on... I took off the afternoon to watch the eclipse with my big boy. You took the afternoon off to show the house to buyers! You want us to leave. You're right. It's also to show the house, but... What are you doing? Think we'd let you brood the day of the eclipse? Rufus. Got your slingshot? I broke the living-room mirror with a cherry pit. My dad confiscated it. Why are you here? You don't live here anymore. Nicholas! Stop, he'll bite you. - Don't go. - Come back. It's gonna be a bloodbath. He doesn't look mean. It's the move. He hated it. He came back. Beginning of the last phase. 4/5 of the sun is hidden by the moon. The concealment isn't complete, but seems to quicken. The sun is no longer round. A croissant! In 32 years, for the next eclipse, we'll be really old. I'll be a policeman, like my father. I'll be the President. Or optician. I'll sell pork products. I'll give you discounts on sausages. Because we'll always be friends. Obviously! We're the Invincibles, aren't we? The Invincibles! We may be the Invincibles... but we're not inseparable. I have no idea what I'll be doing in 32 years. But in any case... I won't be here. What's that dog's problem? What do you want? He must be hungry. Nicholas! Look! BIG REWARD There's your treasure! "Big reward"... Hello, we're here for the visit. Come in, please. Welcome! Hello. Pretty street, your home especially. Love the facade. Yes, on a nice day... Less so in the winter. So, here you have... the living room. Dining room. Lovely. The office area. The wallpaper looks new. We change it regularly. After every leak. Leaks? Two weeks ago, it was like India here. Monsoon season. The pipes back up. But luckily, today there's no sewer smell. Although... Come see the kitchen. It's the garden we fell in love with! You like animals? Of course. You'll be thrilled! The garden is a kingdom for moles! It's true. Very nice moles, they never bite. Never. Good thing you mentioned it, honey. You'll love it here, you'll see. Even if... intimacy-wise... I bought artichokes at the market! Two francs a piece? Too expensive! You got ripped off again! It's a very comfy home. Not enough closet space, if your husband collects sardine tins. There's lots of stuff to do. No staff to help you. But it's a simple, warm home, you feel it's where you belong. It's our place. Our home. Yes. The bedrooms now? I have no business sense. It's as if you have no desire to sell this house. I feel you don't really want to become director. It's too late. How will you manage? It's an immense honor that you did me, Mr. Moucheboume. And I'll be grateful till my last dying day. That's a bit over the top. And I'm very grateful. But... I've weighed the pros and the cons, and I don't think I'm ready. I still have so many things to learn, at your side, Mr. Moucheboume. You know how greatly I admire you. Your moderation, your wisdom, your composure, your equanimity. I'll show you! "On the line"... This is far from over. Thank you. Dad! Mom! What do you mean? You can't imagine. I never saw Moucheboume like that. Violent, furious. What did you say? Nothing, it was impossible. He was like a madman, persuaded Grifaton bribed the ref. He accused them of corrupting sports ethics! "His serve was let. I should have won the match." Can he change his mind? Never. I know Moucheboume. If he says the deal's off, the deal's off! What? All those crates to unpack... Not leaving anymore? Your boss realized his utter foolishness. Exactly. We're moving back. Well... I have no say in it. I have champagne chilling in the fridge. Be right back. Really? We're not moving? No, we're staying here! Tell your friends you'll be here to see the Observatory. If they win. If they win, right. But I trust him and his pals. An Invincible can't lose. Goodbye, have a nice day. - Hello, ma'am! - Two croissants, Alceste? No, I'd like chocolate bars. How many? Five hundred. What's wrong, son? You know school is closed now. I have a favor to ask. Impossible! And then what? In exchange, you get the whistle thief. I'm in. It's a deal. But... You? Why? You're the one who... Don't be angry with me, sir. I've always done what's expected of me. I never knew the thrill of transgression. As Danish philosopher Kierkegaard says, "Life is not a problem to resolve, but a reality to experience". Right? To understand good, we must understand evil. And stealing is bad. Very bad! But technically, since you've returned them, it's not theft, it was a loan. Now you get your initials on the insignia! Let's get to work. This is a very promising start! You're right to applaud. Encouragement is the foundation of education. We're off to a great start, right kids? Thanks to Mrs. Henri's class for the wonderful telescope. The tin cans are a clever idea. We can now move onto the next project. Mr. Dubon... Not bad! Not bad at all. A "spatial" rocket, or rather a "special" rocket. It's a pun. Only two projects left. You can vote by dropping off your ballot in the box. And the class that wins the competition will have the honor of visiting the illustrious Meudon Observatory. - Can I go? Bellyache. - Of course. What's their problem? Indigestion. Lightweights. Now it's time to move on to project 3. Pretty! Undeniably a beautiful piece of work. I trust Mrs. Bouillaguet as to the precision of the chart. Since all good things must come to an end... project 4. Excuse me. Excuse me. We'd like to have presented a well-executed project. But an unfortunate incident arose. For which I'm entirely responsible. If only I'd been more diligent! What you're about to discover is not the project the children imagined. Executioner, do you duty. Better than a planet! A veritable sun! Thank you. We may have won the competition. Maybe not. No one will ever know. The principal lost the key to the ballot box. You misplaced something, Mr. Principal? You're really not "keyed in". It's pun. So, no Observatory for us. But I didn't care. I'd learned something important. I imagined that time would go by. That one day or another, we'd no longer be at school. No more teacher. One day or another, we'd be grownups. And maybe even... we'd have houses. Jobs. Wives, and even children. I knew we'd all become very busy, and see less of each other. That's life, or so they say. I knew that at the next eclipse, in 32 years, the empty lot would have changed. But I also knew that, even in a long time, some things would remain. Friends are like little suns. They never really disappear. Even when you don't see them. They're there. Always. And for me, that's the greatest treasure.
