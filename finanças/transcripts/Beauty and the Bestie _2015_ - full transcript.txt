--== McEphie ==-- Do you see that contestant in green? -That's my daughter. -I can see her. Make sure you get her from every angle. Take a picture when it's time to announce the winner, because she will cry. She will win. Go for gold. Let's call on, Ms. Kim Chiuchuvaca. Erika, do you really need to stoop to this kind of work? Jimbo and Jumbo's tuition fees are expensive. We wouldn't be here if you earned money yourselves. Edith. Hold this for me. Hey Move. Move! Out of the way. Hands up! Don't move. Don't even think about it. George, cuff him. How could you? We're siblings. I can't believe you shot me. Yes, we are siblings. I can't believe you actually thought bullets would come out of my fingers. -Are you stupid? -I don't care! I'm going with Jojo. I cannot allow you to go with Jojo. I know his family. He and his children have a dark past. Wait, we haven't been proven guilty, right? -Come on! Get back on my bike. -Sorry. Edith, you can't go with him. You have kids. That's why I'm doing this. So I can give my kids a better life. How can you make your kids' lives better by riding that motorcycle? Are you a debt collector? No matter what you say, I'm still going with Jojo. Edith. I hope the cops catch you. You're not wearing helmets. You chased me all the way here, sir. Have mercy, sir. I have no other way of earning money. My son is in hospital. -Let him go, George. -What? Let him go. Sir, thank you. If I catch you again, I won't be as forgiving. Thank you, sir. I'll go now. I can't believe you. We chased him all the way here and you're just letting him go? -What is this, a fun run? -I pity him. Sister, come eat with us. Sorry, this is all I cooked. We just got off from school. Aunt, where's mommy? Why did mommy take all her clothes with her? Jimbo, Jumbo... from now on, it's just us. Hold it. Stay still. Is this OK? Wait. What are we going to do? This one. It hurts. I'm tired. It's so hard to take pictures of you. You can't smile properly. Why is it so difficult for you to show your love for each other? How can we smile properly when you keep on moving like a worm stuck in salt? I find it hard to take pictures because neither of you are good-looking. And you're not paying me enough for you to criticize me. This is the modern way of taking photographs. Is it my fault that this guy's eyes don't shine with any love for you? Hey! I am in love with her. Well, I don't see it. All I can see in your lying eyes is that you're just after her money. I'm not rich. -Isn't your mom an overseas worker? -Yes. Then she has saved money for sure. And when your mother dies, who will inherit all her savings, canned goods, and imported lotions? -Me, of course. -See? That's why your marriage won't last, because I know you are only after the money that her mother has. Or maybe it's her mother that you actually want? Let's go! We're done. -Is that true? -Of course not. You shouldn't take your bitterness out on our customers. They should be thankful for the life lessons I taught them. We will never get any customers because of your drama. Studios like this are no longer in anyway. You should close shop. Why don't you close the pores on your face instead? Are you crazy? I can't close this studio. I inherited this from my father. I'm not like you, who does not value his inheritance. Would you value it if you'd inherited this face from your ancestors? You have a point. Sister! Abi? Before you continue, I want to ask for your forgiveness. I know I have a lot of shortcomings. I can't afford to give you everything you need. But Abi, there's no need to use the coffee tablecloth for shorts. This isn't a tablecloth. This is trendy. Don't blame me if your fashion sense is stuck in the past. That's harsh. Why are you rushing anyway? Jumbo is missing, sister. What? Your nephew is missing? And you still took the time to mock my fashion sense before telling me? Where the heck is your brother? My God! I have no idea where else to look. Naynay, a noodle house. -Ignore your hunger for now. -Maybe he's-- Just wait. You can eat later. Naynay, noodles are Jumbo's favorite. -Look, noodles. -You too? Look for my nephew first. -Maybe there's a birthday party. -So what if there is? Stop. Look for my nephew. Look for him. Where is he? Think of the kid. We have to find him. This isn't right. -Jumbo? Naynay, it's Jumbo! -Jimbo? Jumbo. We've been looking for you everywhere. Why did you leave the house without asking permission? Does anyone ask for permission when they run away? I was hungry. You should always ask permission. At least tell the director so he knows where to put the camera. We've been looking for you all day. My head's spinning from-- Jumbo. -What's happening? -Jumbo. -Jimbo. -Jumbo! -Sis. -What? That's Jimbo. Hey! Jumbo. Jimbo. How will we ever finish this movie if you keep making scenes like this? Take him to the hospital so we can go to the next scene. Jumbo! Doc, how's my nephew? What? My God. What's that? Why does he need to have a ventosa? But in his case, so we can be sure of obtaining an accurate diagnosis. If possible, stem cell treatment will be an option. Doc, am I going to go blind? -Jimbo, don't say that. -There's a possibility. I didn't do anything. Don't worry. We'll do everything we can to prevent that. Doc, how much will it cost us? Plus about ten thousand each for other tests and medicine. My God! That's a big amount. Naynay, I won't be able to see mom. Doc, listen to me. I am not the first one to say this, but I will say it anyway. Doc, do the best you can, no matter how much it costs. Just make sure my nephew lives. He didn't say anything about dying. Did you get it cheap? -Yeah, of course. -Jesus Christ. Where will I get the money for Jimbo's medical bills when I didn't earn anything? Why don't you just upgrade? You know? If I had the money to upgrade, I'd rather use it to pay for these hospital bills. I know! Let's just sell some flesh... -Yuck. -You're disgusting. ...of pigs and cows. I know a supplier. What? Why don't we just start a business using your pimples? We definitely won't run out of supplies. Especially if we add Erika's pimples. You can mock anything about me except my pimples. Because all the men I have ever known left me. But my pimples, Because of my pimples, I believe my forever exists. -Crazy. -Naynay! Jimbo needs you. What's happening? -Jimbo, what is it? -Jimbo is... Naynay, I can't see anything. Sis, I can't see anything either. -It's so dark. -What the heck! That's my butt. You have to open your eyes. Open your eyes so you can see. Even if I open them, I still can't see anything. It seems like your nephew's eyes are getting worse. -I feel like he is going bli-- -Don't you dare finish that sentence. What? -That he'll probably go blind-- -I said don't say it. -What? That your nephew is going blind-- -Why are you saying that? What's wrong with you? He told you not to say his nephew might be going-- You, too. I told you I don't want to hear you saying my nephew might be going bli-- Try to slap me. It's your fault. You can't keep your mouth shut. We'll go to the hospital. Jimbo, stop crying. Why do we always get lame assignments? Stop whining. Just work. Should I shoot now? Wait! Just relax. Put that down. I have a plan. That's Agent Reyes' car, right? -He just got lucky. -What a bad trip. Agent Reyes is here. There they are. -Here comes Mr. Pride. -Agent Reyes. Very admirable. You are a perfect example of a good Elite Super Secret Task Force Agent. No big deal. I didn't even sweat. Next time, Chief, give me a tougher assignment. I called all of you here for our next anti-terrorism -assignment, ah... -Sir, where are you? -We can't see you, sir. -Wait. Apple box. Here it is, sir. -Everybody good? -Yes, sir. I'll repeat what I just said: I called all of you here for our next Watch this. Natalia Thalia Notrella. She looks like a lion. She's ugly. She won't win. She's so ugly. has been assigned as the Uniworld Pageant's security. I think Castillo can secure that pageant. It'll be easy for him. Right? This was taken from CCTV footage. Right after Natalia arrived in the Philippines, she was kidnapped by armed men. We are unable to identify the suspects at this time. As of the moment, the authorities have yet to figure out where Natalia is being held. The pre-pageant will begin in two-to-three days. We still have no leads for any of the suspects. We cannot let Prime Minister Thor know that his daughter is missing. If he finds out, he might terrorize the Philippines and other countries. We all know that they hold the strongest nuclear weapons today. But Chief, I don't think he's going to do that. He won't terrorize the Philippines. Really? Did he tell you? His daughter is here. He won't risk her life. His daughter will die as well if he bombs us. Still, the Prime Minister shouldn't find out that his daughter has been kidnapped. It's simple, Chief. Let's find Natalia before the pageant starts. We cannot be certain we will find her in two-to-three days. What if we find someone who can pretend Natalia in the meantime, while we search for the Prime Minister's daughter? What an excellent plan, Castillo. But where will you find someone who looks like that? A doppelganger? A twin? Good luck on finding someone as ugly as that girl. There is someone. And I know him very well. If you're a mugger, I've already been mugged multiple times. Erik. Who the hell-- It's Emman. So, you're still alive. Can we talk? No. Why? Are we OK? I'm just gonna go for it. I know we're not OK. I know that you're still mad at me. But, Erik, I need your help. Amazing. You "need my help", just like that? You won't get anything from me. I don't want to talk to you. After everything that happened? After all these years? You show up just because you need me? I was so hurt by what happened between us. I felt so small after what you put me through. And now you need me? How dare you! I have feelings, too. I'm human. How-- How rude. You show up just to make me talk to thin air. Please, listen to me. Amazing. Did you listen to me when I was talking to you? No, you left me there. And then you show up at my house before I do. Just listen to me for five minutes. I have a top secret mission. I need you. Do you need me because you love me? Or do you love me because you need me? Erik, I need you. I need you to pretend to be Ms. Uzeklovakia. Uzeklovakia? No way! Norway. Not Ms. Norway. Ms. Uzeklovakia. Stupid. Why me? Because you look exactly like her. Look. -She is so ugly. -I know. That's why she looks like you. Amazing. Erik, just listen to me. Ms. Uzeklovakia was kidnapped, and if her father, the Prime Minister, finds out, he will be furious. He might start World War III. If you accomplish this mission, you'll get a job-well-done? And a job-well-done means a promotion. Right? Right. I knew it, Erik. Nobody knows me like you do. Not really. I'm just used to your ways. I've actually been waiting for this moment. You mean you've been waiting to agree to help me out? Bestie? No. I've been waiting for the moment that karma bit you. It got stuck in traffic, but at last it has come in like a wrecking ball. Bestie. Erik. Sis, you're here. Have you eaten? Not yet. -Why are you mad? -I'm not mad. Why are you shouting? I'm just happy. Is that so? Well then, I'll prepare your food. Why are you shouting? Because I'm happy, too. We're having kare-kare. -Did your ex leave already? -Which ex? -Your ex-best friend. -How did you know? -I opened the door for him. -Why did you do that? Because it was closed. Why are you shouting? Because I'm also happy. It's so hard to be happy. It makes my throat hurt. Just go watch TV. My bestie is so handsome. So hot. So cute. -Hey! -Who's that you're kissing? Bea Alonzo's picture. She's my crush. -Why? -Let me see. -No. -I'll kiss her, too. It has my saliva already. So what? We can share. Just kiss me, then-- I mean, find something else to kiss. You're so selfish. Share it. She's my crush. Find your own. Where are my ID pictures? Look for your name. You know where they're placed. You're always like that. Keeping all the girls to yourself. -Why are there only five pictures? -Ask my father. He developed those. Forget about it. I'll just give you a discount. It's fine. I just need two for my application. Why? Where are you applying? Bestie, I'm applying to join the Elite Super Secret Task Force. Really? -Is that so? -Yeah. I can see you working there. You'd fit right in. -Why me? -You love action movies. Your action moves are amazing. Why don't you apply, too? Come on, Bestie. If we apply together, we'll be together all the time. We will graduate together, too. Don't you want that? Really? Hey! What are you doing, closing your eyes like that? I'm just deciding if I should join you. Don't be so malicious. I think it's a good idea. So, we'll apply together? -Come on. -I guess. We'll apply together? -I said yes. -Really? Promise? -Of course. -No turning back. No one gets left behind, Bestie. -Great. -Ouch. -What is it? -I'm taking pills. Pills? I mean steroids so I can make my body bigger. And I did some push-ups a while ago. Why do you have nail polish? Because... I'm a rocker. Punk's not dead. So, I can rock on. I thought you were a hippy but now you're a punk. I'll just pay for this next time, OK? I got that covered. I'm already used to it. -This is free? -I got it. You're really one of a kind. -There you go again. -We're best friends. Don't forget our application. What? Chillax, we're all friends here. Don't be a sensitive gay. Go work on your application. Yeah. My bestie is so hot. Who the hell are you? If my father finds out about this, everyone in this country is gonna die. Call an interpreter. What is she saying? Please say something, he's starting to get pissed. The interpreter's useless. She can't force Natalia to speak. Kill her. -Kill me... -Kill her. Wait. OK, I know you're pissed off, but please give me time to say this. Is this the way you'll treat me after all I've done? My God! This is unbelievable. And even you Derek... Why hate when all you need is love? Didn't I tell you that? Tristan? Your snack's ready. -Your earphones will make you deaf. -Ma? My handsome firstborn is here. Just in time. You got home early. Come, son. Take a seat. Great. I'm very hungry. Pa. Sit down. -Any news regarding your work? -Pa, I was given a new assignment. It's pretty tiring, but I'm doing fine. I already know about your new assignment. I talked to Chief Ben a while ago. You're already tired, just from that? Back in my day, even if I had five assignments I was able to work on all of them. -I've been calling you. -Hey, bro. Don't make the food wait for you. Can you please get that bird out of here? I told you I'm asthmatic. Naynay! We're leaving. Where's our lunch? Here, I just finished preparing it. Jimbo... Eat this squash soup. You and Jumbo can share this squash rice. I also prepared another dish. Exclusive mixed vegetables with squash. In case you get thirsty, I also made you some squash juice. With real squash pulp bits. But Naynay, those might squash our grades. Can't we eat any other kind of vegetable? No. You can't. other than squash. That will "squash" my taste buds. That's OK. The important thing is it will give you better vision. But he's the only one going blind. Don't say that. He has been cured. Aren't you feeling better now, Jimbo? Yes. Look at Naynay. Is Naynay pretty? No. You are healed. You really blabber a lot. Go to school now. Carry these. Study well or else I'll ask Wolverine to pinch you. Your juice. Kiss Naynay. Hurry, Jimbo. -That gay guy is funny. -Please come in. Why are we here? It's expensive here. It's cheap. We always eat sushi and maki here. Liar. How can you afford to eat here when you don't have any money? Maybe they served you "yucky", not Japanese. Sis, it's kind of cold here. You look shorter. Why are you standing in the pond? What are you doing to the fish? Sorry, I thought you had to clean your feet before eating in a Japanese restaurant. This is not a spa! Let's go. They might sue us for damages. We can't afford that. You know, you really annoy me. Why? You love that hairstyle. You think it makes you look good? Julia Montes. Where? -Right here. -John Lapus. How dare you mock my hair, just because your hairstyle suits you. Liza. -Soberano? -Lorena. That's not even insulting. I'm more insulted with your reaction. Just because you're the one who actually looks like Liza. -Soberano? -Seguerra. But you're the most beautiful in our group. That's true. You know it. You look like Bea. -Alonzo? -Bea Bunda. But you are the sexiest, right? Really? You finally noticed. Bangs. Garcia? Bangsamoro. -Your body's as big as a group of people. -That's harsh. -Oh, here it comes. -Sir, wrong table. -We haven't ordered yet. -That's a lot. It's OK, Sis. No, it's not. We didn't order these. -These are delicious. -I'm hungry. -Where did these come from? -Erik. Those are for you. How did... You gluttons. You sold your souls to the devil just so you could eat Japanese food? Spit it out. Spit. -Erik. -Spit them out. I can't believe this. I'm leaving. You've been walking so much I'm out of breath. Of course you're out of breath. Your steps are so short. It's because I'm not a horse like you. What? What are you doing? You're so irritating. -I don't want to see you. -You don't want to see me? Are you sure about that? You're so... Stop it. What are you doing? Do you want me to have a heart attack? You know my heart beats faster when I see you. Erik. I'm here to soften your heart. Please. Talk to me. What do you think my heart is? Some item you can use fabric softener on? I know you're still in love with me, even now. And Erik, this isn't for me. This is for the country's economy. First, you're delusional to say I still like you. Second, if it's for the economy, why don't you talk to politicians? Don't you get it? I don't want to see you, smell you, or feel you. Come on! Get in the car. I'm not moving. I don't care how long it takes, I'm not moving. I will sleep here. -Get up. -I'm not moving until you talk to me. Then stay there! Let's go. You think you can outsmart me? Talk to me. Erik. I would like to remind everyone that the Church prohibits rushing and racing your baby out of the church. After the baptism, can you run my grandchild out the door? Do you have an ear infection? Didn't you hear what he just said? That's not allowed. I have gout, so I am unable to do it myself. I'm sorry. I don't want to do it. I'm a photographer, not a runner. Grandma. I am not a catholic. You know, I once beat Lydia de Vega in a race. -Really? -Yes. Be a good godparent... Our baby is so beautiful. -Give her to me. -Why? -That's my child. -It's OK. Let him go. Where are you bringing our baby? Give my baby back. Hey! What did I just say? The baby. Ouch. Oh! Thank you for catching him. Even here? Get away from me. I'm not even that close to you. Stop overreacting. Erik? Don't touch me. Let go of me. I'm not touching you. Sis, I'm the one holding you. We need to take Jude to the hospital. Let him be. Come on, Sis. Erik, please. You're doing this for the country and the whole world. Before I can think about the country, I need to think about my family. Then think of it like you're doing this for your family. What can I do to make you agree? You just don't know when to give up. All right. Take me to your office. You look exactly the same. Maybe you're Uzeklovakian, too. Investigate me if you think that. Aren't you the chief investigator? Right, guys. I think it's time to create a Look Alike Task Force. Are we really going to prioritize that over the main mission? Good thing I got my best friend to agree. What do you mean I agreed? I haven't agreed to anything. -But you told me to bring you here. -Yes. To bring me here. But I'm not saying yes yet. I just wanted to see if your boss looked like an emoticon, like you told me. You've been talking behind my back, huh? -Sir, he's just kidding. -No, he really said that. Erik, don't embarrass me in front of my colleagues. Not in front of them? OK. Everyone, turn around. So, can I embarrass you now? Come on, Erik. Don't be like this. You can face us again. Erik, this mission is very important to us. We are not here to play games with you. I'm not that hard to please. Especially if you will agree to my conditions. OK. Let's talk about that, Mr. Villavicencio. All right, tell us. Call me mister and I will call Batman to tell him that the Penguin is here. First condition, make sure my nephew gets the best eye treatment. Also, you need to find my missing sister Edith. Second condition, my nephews should have regular supplies of foods and groceries in our house. When my nephews turn fifteen, they have to get into the Big Brother house and be declared the grand winners. And my sister Abi has to be the first person ever to see Big Brother. -You're asking for too much. -Fine, if it's too much, forget it. -I don't want to impose. -No. It's fine. Contact Big Brother. It's fine. We're good. We're not yet good. There's one more thing. You need to reach this without tiptoeing. You can do it, Emman. Don't insult my boss. Then you do it. Sir, you can do it. You're already there, but you're asking me. You can do it. Reach for it. Stop it. I'm your boss. -Now what? The deal is off, then? -No. Maybe we can negotiate. I'll think of something else that's not so hard for you. I know. I want to see all of you twerking. Emman. Go Emman. -Emman doesn't want to, Chief. -Emman, dance. Emman. That's it! Just dance. Emman has no energy, Chief. Emman has no energy. My goodness. Emman's not doing it, Chief. Hey. Naynay will be gone for a while. Be good, OK? What about us? Who will take care of us? Come here. Let's talk. Don't get upset, OK? Naynay really needs to focus on her work. Are you going to look for mommy? We'll come with you. Kids are not allowed where I'm going. But I promise when I come back, Mommy Edith will be with me, OK? Promise? I will be richer because of you. Because if your father finds out that you're missing, he will surely declare a war. There will be a massive demand for my firearms. Do you know the leader of Irakenrol? He will pay me in exchange for you. I will have lots of money. I'm going to bring you to Irakenrol. We'll bring her now. She's not here. Master, you need to see this. Kill that impostor. Don't come back until she's dead. He's just in a meeting. He'll be back soon. Here, use this lab gown-- No? OK, I'll just hug you then. You're so cute. Just wait here. The doctor will be with you shortly. I'll come back, OK? I think we're in the wrong clinic. Your doctor's name is Kenneth Sy, right? It says right there, "Kenneth Sy." Um, Doctor, it's... Jimbo, you're here. He's Doctor Sy. See? Teeny eyes. Yeah, you're right. Who's he? How did you know? "Abi." Tristan. -What do you mean, love? -He said lab. Laboratory. Not love. -OK. Sorry. -I think she's getting deaf. -My bad, sorry. -Yeah. That's true. Come here. -What's your problem? -What are you doing? We'll get caught if you keep doing this. This is how beauty contests work. You need to get noticed to win. Get it together. You'll expose our mission. Your whispering is what will expose us. All right, go back there. Do it properly. First you want me to come, now you want me to go. -Hurry. -Kiss me. -Kiss me. -Go. One kiss. There it is. Miss Jemma, one pork blood stew. Jimbo, Jumbo, I told you to take a bath already, didn't I? You never listen to me. Why don't you take a bath first? Besides, you smell worse than we do. Even if I don't wash myself for three days my armpits still smell good. Smell it if you want-- -I'm sorry. -It's OK. Can you take my picture? What kind of picture? OK, right. Let's start. -This is just an ID picture, right? -Yeah. OK. Just play for the camera. One more. OK. Show me the "Boy-next-door" pose. That's for an ID picture? Beats me. Naynay, when will you come home? Jimbo, just wait a little longer. -How are your eyes? -I still have two of them. When he goes blind, he won't have eyes anymore. Naynay, when are you really coming home? It might take a while. Just go to sleep now, then wake up, then sleep again, then wake up. Stop joking, Naynay. When I wake up, will mommy be back home, too? Yes, maybe. OK. Time for bed. You still have to wake up early tomorrow. -Bye. -OK. I am talking to my nephews. No, I was talking to my father. Acting all girly. They look like cross dressers. I'm so exhausted from the rehearsals. Do you have any bottled water? Who's this young man? That's my brother, Tristan. He's just my half-brother. My mother and father separated before. When Tristan's foreigner father died, my mother came back to us. Handsome, right? A womanizer just like you. Hey. Why are you driving like this? -What's happening? -Erik, get down. Run. Escape now. -Leave me here! Run. -How? -It's Ms. Uzeklovakia. -Let's help her. Get out of the way. -Move! Get out the way. -No! We won't go. -You don't want to, huh? -Take care of yourself. We ran out of bullets. This will do. What about it, huh? Erik. I'm glad you're safe. Emman! I thought I was going to die. This is a form of abuse. Your hair stinks. I'm not caressing you, I'm just really scared. I almost died. Don't be scared. Trust me. I will always save you. The important thing is that you focus on the contest. Our mission is almost over. Let's go back to your room. What are you doing? Were you going to kiss me? how long you'd been sleeping. Not that long. I'm just waiting for the boys. Just going home. Walk? We won't take a ride? You're company is very generous. There's so many of these. You know where the kitchen is, right? Bring them up there, OK? But you... Go the other way, to my room. You're so gullible. The truth is I don't live here. -Thank you for accompanying us. -Hi, Uncle Jude. Oh, Abi! It's good you're here. Why? Would it be bad if we weren't here? Don't be as sarcastic as your sister Erika. Let's go inside now. Come on. Perfect. Oh no. We don't have any food. Can you wait? I'll cook. I'm so hungry I could even eat you right now. Maybe we can call for delivery. You're very generous. Thank you. Jimbo, come let's eat. OK. I'll give you the ID pictures for free. I'll develop them later. OK. Let's develop later. We'll develop? I'll help you develop the pictures. OK. Never. I believe I'll be forever alone. Do you believe in forever? My sister Erika told me forever is just a fantasy. I believe that someone out there will love me forever. Someone who's great to be with. Someone I won't get bored of. Maybe he's out there somewhere. He can be our customer, -or a delivery boy-- -Or the one you're talking to right now. Will I wait forever for my food, too? Ah, no. Sorry. From Tristan. Thank you, Tristan. I hope you treat us for forever as well. Where is Natalia? She hasn't been found yet, right? What do you mean? Wasn't she kidnapped? Not the real Natalia. Erik. Where's Erika? Erik. What are you doing here? The rehearsals have started. I already know what to do. Why are you sad? I don't know how my nephews are doing back at home. Abi's not answering her phone. By the way, have you found my sister? We have leads. But we're having a hard time because she's very mobile. Edith is really one of a kind. Every time she falls in love, she runs away. But why is it that no matter how many times she leaves her children, at the end of the day, they still long for her? Don't think about that. I'm sure that some day they will understand what you're doing. Because you're doing it for them. While me, no matter what I do, I'll never be good enough for my father. Don't worry. One day, he'll realize that what you're doing is for him. Emman... can I visit my nephews, even just for a moment? Erik, we'll get in trouble if we do that. Please. I beg of you. Even for just a few minutes. I'll find a way. Really? How? I don't know. Just trust me. But how? Just leave it to me. How? Kids, finish your food 'cause I have a surprise. Naynay. He's so annoying. How are your eyes, Jimbo? Naynay, why are you always away? What are you really working on? I'm a secret agent, Jimbo. What's that? I just said it's a secret. For now, let's just stick to agent. I will explain it to you someday. Naynay, have you found mommy? We're looking for her, Jumbo. You're not looking for her. You don't love us. -What's taking you so long? -No... -No. It's not like that. -Jumbo. -Erika. -No. Come here, let's talk. It's not like that. It's not. Jumbo, what you said is not true. Do you know that your Naynay loves you a lot? He hardly eats or sleeps, or showers or brushes his teeth. He is working hard to pay for your brother's medical bills, and to find your mommy, Edith. Do you understand? OK. Apologize. No. Jumbo! You will understand someday. Someday. Emman, kiss me too. I'll hit you. I'm going. Thanks. How can I say no to you? You're my best friend. Your bird is showing. Oh! It's so big. -Of course. It's imported. -I recognize that voice. I do too. Do you hear anything? Nothing. Let me. Now I can hear something. What? The pounding heart of a gay pervert. That's harsh. What bird are you talking about? That's so unbecoming. Let me see the bird! Show me the bird. Tristan's pet bird, sister. What bird do you want to see? That one. Tristan, what are you doing here? Developing with each other. You have bad intentions, don't you? she just taught me how to process film. There you go Erik. Calm down. My brother is trustworthy. He's a good kid. I won't calm down because my sister is with your brother. Then what? He's just like you. He'll hurt my sister. What happened to you won't happen to her. Why? Never mind. Forget it. Say it to my face. Coward. -Because she's a girl and she's pretty. -And me? Gay and ugly. That's harsh. I don't care. No matter what you say, I won't allow them to be friends. -Is there something wrong with that? -There is. Especially if the person you're befriending is a liar. You have a point. There are people who are liars, who will make you believe that they only see you as a friend when the truth is, there's malice in all that they do. Yes! Liar. Someone who makes you believe they are your best friend, but as soon as they learn your weakness, instead of understanding you, they're the first to turn their back on you. A liar like you. Hey! You're the liar. You've been lying to yourself. You try to convince yourself that you have moved on, but the truth is, I'm still the one inside your heart. Are you trying to make me laugh? You act so high and mighty when you're height is just 5'5". Be thankful I'm small. If I wasn't, I wouldn't fit inside your heart. Erik. How will I ever find the path to forgiveness inside your heart? Try Google Maps. A lot has really changed between us, huh? If only we could repeat our happy times again. It's easy. How? Just repeat it. "Our happy times." "Our happy times." See? Easy. Wait. Were you a couple? Yuck. We were never a couple. Tristan, stay away from my sister. Really? You're courting me? Isn't it obvious? I think I'm in love with you. But wait, I'm scared. What if your love is like magic? It feels real at the start, but in the end there's a trick. Tell your brother to stay away from my sister. If not, I'm going to back out from our deal. Tristan, stop courting Abi. Leave. Now. There. I did as you said. Leave us for a moment. Hey, you. Don't you fall for that guy. He's a player just like his brother. I know them. They are liars. You mean, Whatever! He's just playing you. -Tristan, stay away from Abi. -I cannot stay away. But-- Do whatever you want. Hey! Big brother. Tristan, what are you talking about? You want to know why I don't talk to you? Because you keep speaking in English. I can't understand you. There you go again. You always speak in English. I'm sorry, big brother. I'm sorry, too. OK. I'll try harder to speak in Tagalog. Are you sure you want to court Abi? Yes. What else can I do but support you? Just push for it. Thank you, bro. OK. Take care on your way home. Oh, flowers. Are those for me? No. This is for Abi. Ouch. Ow. -Thanks, Doc. -No problem. Looks like Tristan isn't here. Didn't Naynay get mad at you for that? -Here? -Yes. Yeah, it hurts. It stings. Oh, my. I think you forgot. This is a hospital, not a motel. Hey. I need a picture. We're closed. -I need phone credit. -There's no signal here. -I need your forgiveness. -Ask the Lord for forgiveness. How are you going to explain what I saw? -Are you jealous? -Yes! No. Are you trying to make me jealous on purpose? I love you, Abi. Did you think I wouldn't see you? Why are men like that? You don't consider our jealousy even if you're caught in the act. I wish I had listened to my sister and avoided this self-inflicted pain. Get out of here. I hate Emman. His brother is courting my sister. Now, my sister is head over heels for him. If he makes her cry, Tristan will pay for it. Quiet, he might hear us. Hey! I can understand everything that you're saying. Erik, come on, don't be so bitter. I'm sorry. That's too much. Nothing, Ms. Barney. Let's go. Your big body. What? Ma'am, she said good morning. And that you look so slim and sexy. You look like you're on a diet. Your fat body is about to explode. What did she say? Does she have a problem with me? She said you look beautiful in your dress. It fits you perfectly. Oh! Thank you very much. Pick it up, hurry. Ah, sorry, that's mine. I accidentally dropped it. Oh my God! What are you doing? Why is that there? What's in there? Oh my gosh, Madame. Why didn't you tell us there was also a buffet on your belly? Buffet on ham. Watch what you're saying. Mabuhay. Hello. Hello. Are you sure she'll exit here? She's a VIP. This is where they usually come out. Emman. Look at those men on the other side. The one with bonnet. They are going to shoot me. They're just waiting for the right time. Emman, let's go. Erik, are you on drugs? You're so paranoid. I'm not paranoid. Look, he's now talking to his partner. They will come here and shoot us. We'll all die. I'm telling you. Erik stop it. Once more and I'll send you to the PDEA. What's the PDEA? That's Philippine Dental- Hey! You, too. You're definitely on something. Stop acting high. I'm going to book you into rehab. -Ms. Natalia? -What's this? I don't know how to ice skate. Remember when we were kids. You used to dance and slide while sweeping the floor? Just do that. Just go, flaunt and project. Great. Wow. -Bestie, you're the best. -That was great, Sis. How did you do that? You said you didn't know how to ice skate. You surprised us. What happened to your feet? Sit him down. What happened to your feet? What happened? The ice peeled off my skin. Why didn't you wear proper ice skating footwear? I don't know how to use it. If I had, I would have fallen and hit my head. Which is worse, bloody feet or a bloody head? Man, it looks serious. He might need amputation. I don't think so. I think they'll just shave off his soles. Oh wow. I'm so touched by your concern. Don't worry. This is nothing. I'll just blow my feet off and I'll be fine. Oh no, I don't think so. That's a really bad injury. I don't think it will heal quickly. How about your face? How many years before that heals? Oh, Sis. It's not healing yet. I think it's just about to scab. Shut up. I think I'd better take him to the hospital. -I'm leaving Ms. Barney to you. -Sure. Come on, Bestie. Be careful. -Wait a minute. -Why? I need to wear my shoes. -But your feet are injured. -I don't want them to get dirty. So finicky. My feet really hurt. I don't think I can walk anymore. It's because you're unbelievably choosing to wear heels on injured feet. This is called beauty under pressure. Can't you just carry me? -Carry you? -Come on. No way. You're bigger than me. Is that so? Then let me carry you instead. Where did I park my car? Wait. Put me down. Now who's being unreasonable? Where's your car? I can't remember where I parked. Maybe over there? Why don't you just come back for me? Come back for you? -Come with me. Help me find my car. -I can't walk anymore. We've been walking for eight hours. Maybe your car's been stolen. It really hurts! I can't bear it. It's there. That's your car? That's just in front of where we exited a while ago. Just hurry. Unlock the car. -Don't move. -Ah! Who are they? Erik, hurry. -Emman. -Erik, run. -Emman. -Stop. Get down. Emman, what's happening? Erik, get in! Hurry. Get out of the way. Follow them. Stop. -Erik. -Don't move. Hurry! Get in. Ouch, my eyes. Follow them. I'll fall! Emman, I'm scared. Don't be scared. Just hold on. -I'm going to die, Emman. -You're not going to die! Trust me. What will I do? I'm going to die. Just sing. Sing? Are you crazy? What am I going to sing? -The theme song you used to have for me. -What theme song? "Hold On..." I can't remember the lyrics. Hold on. Just keep on holding on. They're coming. What are you gonna do? We haven't finished the chorus! Emman. Let's get out of here. What are you looking at? Let's go. Hurry. Get in. Oh, my... Emman... Are we going to die? Of course not! Just hold on. Get in position. What are you planning? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. The impostor is dead. I can't understand you. Don't talk to me in Korean. I'm Japanese. Master, I'm Korean, not Japanese. I can't understand you. But I am Japanese, and I can't understand you. Just speak in Tagalog. Sorry, boss. The impostor is dead. You know how to speak Tagalog? Why make it hard for me? Are you OK? Thank God we got out safely. "Thank God we got out safely"? So, I should be happy? I should be grateful to you for saving my life? Well, thanks. But I quit. Erik, no matter what, I won't let anything bad happen to you. I'm here to protect you. Are you God? Huh? Are you? Do you know exactly when I'm going to die? Can't you understand? I don't want this. I don't want to obey you anymore. Don't you get it, Emman? I don't want to die. If I die, who's going to take care of my nephews? If I die, who's going to take care of them? You? Will you? I'm done. Erik. Erik! There, it's working. -It's on. It's working! There. -There. Surprise? I can hear you in my room. Seems like it's not a surprise. You're too noisy. You're the noisy one. Ouch! That's my pimple. It's still young. Don't harass the young ones. If you don't want noise, we shouldn't have bought be doing karaoke. We could have played ringtones instead. You're wearing a wig? That's gross. Wow! Look who's talking. -Does it look good? -Yes. RoboCop. Ah, RoboCop You're saying that? With your wig? My hair is real. That's a wig. First gear, second gear, third gear. Fourth gear. Fifth gear. Reverse. Why so arrogant? We're just trying to make you happy. Sing. Come on. The sound is great. Just sing and sing. Erik! Erik. I need to tell you something. Emman, please stop. I'm tired of this. I don't want to risk my life anymore. Erik, listen. This is important. Oh my God. Emman... you've fallen in love with me? How could you, when I have already moved on? So, you're here to propose? Emman. I don't have feelings for you anymore. Whatever. I'm leaving. Wait! Tell me what you want to tell me. So we can have closure. You always do that for me. You're always like that. You don't let me talk. I didn't come here to convince you to finish your mission. I came here to finish my mission for you. Bro? -What? -Bro. She's your sister? You're siblings? No. You're the sibling. Me? Oh my! Edith? -Bro. -Edith? Bro? Edith? Bro? Edith? Bro? Yes, I won't stop calling you "Edith" unless you stop calling me "bro". Edith? -Sis. -All right. Sis... I'm very sorry. You were right about Jojo. He hurt me. There was no one I could ask for help. Good thing Emman was there to help. Sis, these two don't want to sleep. It's mom. My children. Mom? My children. I miss you. Please forgive mommy. Mommy will never leave you again. Mom... What's this? You're also her child? I got carried away. You know I love kids. You have a point. Oh, there you go again. You're too much. Mommy, I'm happy to get to see you before I go blind. Why are you going blind? He hasn't been able to walk for a couple of days. And how's that connected to him getting blind? If you're blind, you won't be able to walk because you can't see. -Walking would be difficult. -I'm leaving. -I missed you so much. -Bye. Emman. Thank you. Do you have a lighter? Get up there! Stop her from escaping. How old is the baby? Twelve months. -What am I? A dinosaur? -These are Jimbo's test results. What do you mean? Will he be cured? Yes. everything is all set for his stem cell treatment tomorrow. Doc. That's good news, Doc. You made me so happy. -Naynay. -What? Shouldn't you be hugging me because I'm the one who'll get better? Naynay is just happy because you will be cured. My Jimbo will be able to see clearly again. Thanks, Naynay. I wouldn't be able to be cured and I wouldn't be able to see Mommy without your help. How sweet, Jimbo. But let's thank Doc because he'll treat your eyes. Sis, hug Jimbo not Doc. He's the doctor. I'm sorry, Doc. I'm just really happy. But I have a problem. What's that? I don't have enough money for Jimbo's treatment. You don't have to pay anything. Emman Castillo paid for everything. Tristan also pitched in. Tristan gave money? Yes. Tristan. If Tristan thinks I can be bribed, well, he's wrong. What did he do to you? I think he has a girlfriend already. I saw them kissing. How did you know they were kissing? I saw their lips touch. We're inside a hospital. Maybe he was just performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. There's no water. Why is your blouse so low? Are you having an x-ray? Sis, why do you always mock my outfits? Why do you always wear those shorts? They're my lucky charm. Your skirt looks like a half-slip. You're driving me insane. Just ask him for your peace of mind. Don't assume things. Love is not an experiment that always has "I therefore conclude...". Wait, didn't you tell me before to avoid Tristan? But you didn't listen, did you? So now I'm telling you, go and love Tristan. -Then maybe you won't listen. -I really love him. -In this movie or in real life? -I love him. But I don't know if he loves me. Why? Because he got mad at me at a premiere night. That's because you made him wait for hours just to get dressed. That girl's here again. Hey! Tell me the truth if you don't want to get hurt. Do you have a relationship with Tristan? Dating-- Tell me the truth. I don't like your answers. What do you want me to say? Tell me you're not dating him. I'm not dating him. -The truth. -That's the truth. -Are you sure? -I'm sure. I like him so I gave it a shot. Four slaps for a kiss? What the hell. I'm sorry too, Tristan. I didn't give you a chance to explain. I forgive you. That's not what I was going to say. Then what? Choose one. Will you love me or will I love you? I'm greedy. Can I choose both? Tristan. Don't try your ninja moves on my sister. Is your name Hokage? You're just like your short brother. So he also stole a kiss from you? Before... Sis, that didn't happen. The only thing ever stolen from you was money. That's harsh. -He's the bodyguard of the fake Natalia. -Yes. That's him. Maybe he knows where Natalia is. Chief, I encountered Natalia's abductors. They said she escaped. Sir, listen to me. I know I failed my mission, but I promise to return Ms. Natalia to you. -But Castillo-- -Sir. I'm doing this for our country, for my father, and for ESSTF. -Sir, please. Let me do this. -Hey. Be gentle on the mayor of Bald City. He can't get a word in. He has a talent fee. Let's give him more scenes. -Bestie, what are you doing here? -I'm here to end all your drama. Let's finish this mission. We're in this together, remember? I always knew you'd always be there for me. My hair. -Do I look good? -Oh, sorry. -Sorry. -You're harsh. Wait. If Ms. Natalia escaped, where is she now? Maybe in a vacant lot? Where? Chief, I'm sure she will go to a hotel. You know, to touch up her makeup. You need to hide the real Ms. Uzeklovakia. That's right. And then I'll stand in for her. I won't allow it. I don't want your life to be in danger. I've already endured a lot in this movie. You promised me I'd join the pageant until the very end. -Stick with the deal. -We need to catch them. Go now! Hurry. -Move, Emman. -Change your clothes to yellow. You still have a shooting session for Despicable Me. Who are you? This is the real Natalia. She knows I'm an impostor. -How? -She smelled my breath. -She said it smelled bad. -Why did you let her smell it? Who're you? Whore? You're crazy. Hey. Hey! Why did you hit her? Let's hide her! Help me carry her. Carry her! Hurry. Carry-- Hurry! Hurry! But be careful. Are you sure nobody saw us? I knew it? Do you have a third eye? Nobody saw us. I was outside. The delegates already left. -Me... -Somebody's talking. Who saw us? -Who? -Who? Who? Why did you hit her? She might die. -So that she can see God sooner. -You're crazy. We can't leave her alone here. I have an idea. I'll stay here. I will look after her. Go, run. Ms. Barney might get bored and come up here. Please take care of here. Don't kill her. -Yes. -Make sure to look after her, or else. -Yes. -Don't shout at me. Juvylin Galaminovich, Miss Bakladesh. Lee Ba Gin, Chinaware. Tatum Patra from Ejeep. Bea Rose Alonzo, Philippines. Natalia Thalia Notrella from Uzeklovakia. Hello, everyone. I farted. Hello, everyone. Hello, everyone. Jumbo, mommy? Look, it's Naynay. Are you sure? Can you see clearly? Naynay's face is one of a kind. I can see its roughness even if camera is zoomed out. Drop. Erik. Erika! Erik. Bestie, are you OK? Are you hurt? -I'm dying, Emman. -Why? Did you get shot? -Yes, in the heart. -How? You're wearing a bulletproof vest. Because what I saw hurt more than a gunshot. Killers are after me and you're flirting? -You're a flirt-- -Move. -Naynay is in danger. -Naynay. We need to go to Naynay. -Escape now. -Hurry. Move. Hurry. You guys are so mean. Where's Erik? They took him there. You! Come here, you. I will finish you now. This is the end for you. How dare you pull my hair. Well, this is going to hurt more. I'll push you down. That's harsh! Emman. Erik. -Erik, hold on. -I will hold on. Just like before when I was madly in love with you. Even though it hurt. I held on. I told you I will not fail you. But Emman, I just want you to know... that I still love you. I love you too. But please forgive me. -Forgive you? -Forgive me for what I'm about to do. Emman? Emman? If you let me fall, I will haunt you. Erik! I'm coming. Lord, please forgive me. You can't fool me. I know you too well. You can't be drowned, you're like a seahorse. Hey! Wake up. That's harsh. Just one kiss. -I'll pay you $250. -Make it $500. Bestie, look how far we've come. -Yet you only brought me here. -Naynay. -Sis. -Naynay. -Naynay. -Congratulations. -Jimbo! Jumbo. -Congratulations. Mission accomplished. What are you doing here? Naynay, I'm so happy you're safe. Thank you, Naynay, for doing all of this for us. But please don't do it again. We can't bear to lose you, right? I would do this all over again for my family. I love you, Naynay. I love you, Naynay. I will drown you, I swear. -Jeez. -Stay here. I don't have someone to hug. Emman. Thank you, sir. First of all, I would like to thank my parents for all of their support. Especially my father. And I would not have finished my mission, if it weren't for my best friend. Ms. Erika Albano Villavicencio. -Oh, is that me? -Yes. You look fabulous. First of all, I'd like to thank my Bestie, Emman. And I'd also like to thank my family, and my friends. Stef and Jovit Baldivino. Long life. You really... Hey! Why aren't you eating? It's delicious. I can't eat. The vendor's distracting me. He's winking at me. He thinks he can get me just by winking? Hello. Stupid. He doesn't like you, he's really like that. -Hello? -May I talk to Agent Castillo. OK. It's for you. -Hello? -Not like that. Like this. -Say, "Hello." -Hello. Agent Castillo, you have a new mission with Agent Villavicencio. You have to rescue the king of Trinidad and Benguet in Hawaii within 72 hours. No one is to know about this mission. This cell phone will self-destruct in five seconds. Bestie, run. -Why did you throw my phone? -Run. My phone. -Let's go. -What's that? Bestie, come on! We'll die here. -Wait. -Come on. This is the last scene. We need to look good. Take care of Coco! Check Coco. Hey, me too. Water. That's harsh. That's harsh. It's expensive here. No, it's cheap here. You're crazy. It's cheap here. -There's lots of people eating Japanese-- -What now? It looks like... Sorry, sorry. What are you doing there? Are we going to wash our feet in the Japanese food before we...? -Japanese food? Japanese restaurant. -Sorry. If you don't help me by impersonating Ms. Uzek... Why are you including me there? Even if they attack, the Prime Minister of-- Many will perish if you don't agree-- I can't do this anymore, Direk. Let go of me. He is the only one who's going to be blind. "He is the only one who's going to be blind." He... He... He is the only one... Blind? That's not your dance number. What bird is that? What bird? Call Mr. Brother. -Who's Mr. Brother? -Mr. Brother... They changed it. OK, OK. Listen to me. Let's adjust it a bit. I'll pay whatever it costs, just do whatever I can. "I" can? Damn you. Then, nothing. Hey, continue. Hey, Tristan. Stop that. Oh, I'm going to enter here? I'm such a fan. I'm going to apply now for the Elite Super Task Force. I'm going to apply now for the Super Elite... I'm going to apply now for the Elite Super Task Force. But are you going to agree? Ouch. Okay, next. You crazies... It's so hot.
