I GOT A "COR-REG-GIO" IN HERE. WELL, YOU'RE NOT COMING IN. - I'M FUCKING COMING IN. - NO... BECAUSE IT'S NOT A "COR-REG-GIO," IT'S A CORREGGIO. JUST LIKE IT'S NOT "TAH-CO," BUT TACO. NOT "PAH-STO," BUT PASTA. SEE? YOUR ENTIRE EDUCATION COMES FROM "CLASSIC CAR" MAGAZINE. AND YOU'RE DRESSED LIKE YOU'RE ON A CONDOM RUN FOR THE MOB. AND BY THE WAY, IT ISN'T A CORREGGIO, IT'S A FAKE REMBRANDT. AND UNTIL YOU KNOW THAT, YOU'RE NOT COMING IN WITH ME. DON'T FUCK ME OVER HERE, PRAT. DON'T THREATEN ME. I'M NOT THE ONE WEARING AN EARRING. Yeah, who is this? I'LL BE WAITING OVER THERE. YES, IT'S TOM RIPLEY. WELCOME. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET THE MAN BEHIND THE... - SCURRILOUS RUMORS? - REPUTATION. I'VE HEARD SO MANY THINGS. PLEASE. WHO KNOWS, SOME OF THEM MAY EVEN BE TRUE. OH, THAT'S FABULOUS. I DID MANAGE TO FIND YOU A GUERCINO. FANTASTIC. LOOK AT THE ENERGY IN THAT LINE. THE TWO PARMIGIANINO. REALLY STUNNING. THIS IS EXTREMELY RARE. OKAY. $1.2 MILLION. - THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED. - WHAT WE AGREED? YOUR PARTNER CALLED ME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. - REEVES? - YES. - MORE PET THAN PARTNER. - HE'S RATHER PERSUASIVE. I HAD NO INTENTION OF PAYING MORE THAN 900K. UH-HUH. BUT SINCE YOU SPOKE WITH HIM, I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERUSE THE DRAWINGS A LITTLE MORE CAREFULLY MYSELF. THIS REMBRANDT FIGURE IS PRETTY WORTHLESS. - I'M NOT DISCOUNTING FOR THAT. - I HOPE NOT. BECAUSE YOU'LL SELL IT AS GENUINE FOR 800,000, THE GUERCINO, 400,000, THE PARMIGIANINO'S 650 FOR THE PAIR. WHEN YOU ADD IN THE OTHERS, YOU'LL CLEAR $3 MILLION EASILY, NO? - I WANT $2 MILLION. - $2 MILLION? YOU MUST BE KIDDING? WE HAD A DEAL. YOU HAD A DEAL WITH REEVES, NOT WITH ME. - 1.3-- FINISH. - $2 MILLION OR FORGET IT. OUT OF THE QUESTION. I WISH YOU PEOPLE WOULDN'T WASTE MY TIME. - YOU PEOPLE? - TERRY, MR. RIPLEY'S ABOUT TO LEAVE. PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THOSE. LEAVE THEM. TERRY! - HE'S DEAD! YOU KILLED HIM. - SHUT UP! - DON'T SHOOT. - SHUT UP. BE STILL. HERE'S THE DEAL-- I'LL TAKE YOUR OFFER-- $1.2 MILLION. BUT DUE TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE MARKET... I'M GOING TO TAKE SEVERAL OF THE DRAWINGS WITH ME. IS THAT CLEAR? - IT'S UP TO YOU. - THAT'S TRUE. SO, PERHAPS I'LL JUST TAKE ALL OF THEM. WOULD YOU LIKE TO KEEP THE FOLDER? IT'S REAL LEATHER. DON'T FOLLOW ME. THAT IS A LOVELY ICARUS. HE FLEW TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN, NO? SORRY ABOUT YOUR FRIEND. - HOW DID IT GO? - VERY WELL. - YEAH? - IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO COUNT $1.2 MILLION. IT'S YOURS. WHAT, YOU DON'T WANT YOUR CUT? NO, I DON'T. YOU MADE THE DEAL. - ALL THIS FUCKING MONEY? - NO, NO, NO. I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN GOT 1.2 IF YOU HADN'T CALLED HIM FIRST. ANYWAY, THIS WAY, AFTER YOU PAY NICHOLAS FOR THE DRAWINGS, - YOU'LL STILL HAVE $400,000. - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T TRUST YOU, BUT I DON'T FUCKING TRUST YOU. FUCKING HELL.

WE WERE HOPING YOU'D COME. WHY? WELL, TO-- TO ADD SPICE TO THE EVENING. MEANING? YOU'RE A BIT OF A LOCAL PERSONALITY. MEANING? PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ABOUT YOU. MEANING? NOTHING. JUST... NOTHING. JONATHAN, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COFFEE? UH, IT'S-- IT'S COMING. - IS EVERYTHING OKAY? - YEAH. GREAT. MARIA... THAT'S WHAT THE ITALIANO AND THE ENGLISH HAVE IN COMMON. PLAIN, SIMPLE FOOD. EGGS IN BUTTER, SUNNY SIDE UP. PERFECTO. MR. RIPLEY. THE LORD OF THE MANOR HIMSELF. WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE. COME HERE. OH... YOU BEAUTIFUL MAN. I MISSED YOU. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR FACE? HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW HE'S GLAD TO SEE ME. HE IS. SEE, THAT'S THE THING ABOUT RIPLEY. HE'S A YANK, BUT HE'S A YANK WITH CLASS. HE'S GOT CULTURE, WHICH IS MORE THAN YOU CAN SAY FOR ME. BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE'S BLOODY WELL OVERJOYED TO SEE ME, AREN'T YOU? ABSOLUTELY, SQUIRE. MARIA, YOU CAN GO HOME, WE'LL LOOK AFTER OURSELVES TONIGHT. NO, NO, NO. MUST SHE GO? SOME EGGS. I'M JUST SHOWING HER A FEW CULINARY TIPS. SHE'S THE BEST COOK IN THE VENETO. I'LL BET SHE IS. BUT EGGS IS EGGS. DIDN'T I ASK YOU TO NEVER COME NEAR ME? - YES, YOU DID. - EVER? BUT I FORGIVE YOU, TOM. I TRUST THERE IS NO CHANCE YOU WERE FOLLOWED HERE, MY LIEGE? I TOLD HER TO LIGHT A FIRE IN THE LIBRARY. - LOVELY. - BUONA SERA. - BUONA SERA. - BUONA SERA, MARIA. REMEMBER THOSE DRAWINGS IN BERLIN?

YEAH, YOU SPENT THE MONEY WELL. ALWAYS. IT'S A LOT OF WOOD. VERY FLAMMABLE. OH, SHIT. A BIT OF GREASEPROOF AND A HOT IRON SHOULD DO THAT. I'LL SORT IT OUT FOR YOU LATER ON. MMM. EXQUISITE, THOUGH. I LIKE YOUR WIFE. SHE FUCKING HATES ME. IN MY BOOK, THAT MAKES HER A GOOD WOMAN. YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN. I DON'T KNOW WHICH I DISLIKE MORE, YOUR ADMIRATION OR YOUR ENVY. ENVY? IT'S NOT ENVY. I'M DOING ALL RIGHT. GREAT. - I'VE GOT THREE CLUBS AND A RESTAURANT IN BERLIN. - GREAT. BUSINESS IS VERY GOOD. AND I DON'T PAY ONE PENNY FOR PROTECTION, EITHER. WELL, I'M CHUFFED. DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT, OR DO YOU WANT SOME TRUFFLING PIG TO FIND YOU DEAD SOMEWHERE IN A MONTH OR TWO? AAH. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, TOM. I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF PROBLEM NEIGHBORS. BUSINESS COMPETITORS... THAT NEED DEREGULATING. BUT I CAN'T BE SEEN TO BE INVOLVED. THAT'S THE THING WITH BERLIN-- EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE. WHO DIED, WHO DID IT, WHO'S NEXT. NOW IF I WANT TO PLAY THIS SAFE, I'M GOING TO NEED SOMEONE THAT'S NOT CONNECTED. AN INNOCENT. - YOU WANT ME TO DO IT? - YES. WHY ME? WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT. AN OUTSIDER, IDEALLY. BUT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. EVEN SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN ON THE SIDELINES FOR A WHILE. WHY NOT SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER PLAYED? 50 GRAND'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR AN AMATEUR. INNOCENCE IS EXPENSIVE. ONCE YOU'VE DIGESTED YOUR EGGS, WHY DON'T YOU AVAIL YOURSELF OF ONE OF OUR LOVELY LITTLE HOTELS IN THE AREA, OKAY? YOU'RE AN ARROGANT BASTARD. ALWAYS WAS, ALWAYS WILL BE. WHY WAS HE HERE? HE WANTS ME TO KILL SOMEONE. - WHY DID HE ASK YOU? - BECAUSE I CAN. I KNOW YOU CAN, SILLY. YOU CAN SEW, TOO. AND... WHY DOES HE WANT THIS PERSON KILLED? I ASSUME HE'S DESPERATE. HIS RESTAURANTS ARE FAILING, HIS NIGHTCLUB'S IN FREEFALL. HE'S INVOLVED IN SOME KIND OF SQUALID TURF WAR. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU CAN'T RUN OFF TO BERLIN TO ASSASSINATE PEOPLE. HE'S A FANTASIST. I'M NOT AN ASSASSIN. - AND HOW WAS THE PARTY? - SMASHING. I KNEW YOU'D HATE IT. - ISN'T IT SAD ABOUT HIM? - WHO? THE PICTURE FRAMER. - HE'S GOT LEUKEMIA. - HMM. IS DRUNKEN POMPOSITY A SYMPTOM? NO. HE'S JUST ENGLISH. HE'S VERY ILL, TOM. HE'S DYING. IT'S A SHAME. IS IT? REEVES. YES, I'VE BEEN REFLECTING ON YOUR PROBLEM, YOUR TALENT SEARCH. MM-HMM. AND I THINK I MIGHT HAVE COME UP WITH SOMEONE. UH-HUH. WELL, HE'S AS INNOCENT AS A NEWBORN LAMB. BUT I THINK UNDER ALL THAT SOFT WHITE FLEECE...

MY GOD, YOU'RE KIDDING. I'M SO SORRY. THANK YOU. SO THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO GET A SECOND OPINION CAME UP AT THIS RESEARCH FOUNDATION. HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT IT, BUT I KNOW HE'S ANGRY. HE'S ANGRY BECAUSE... HE'LL PROBABLY DIE SOON, WHILE THE REST OF US GO ON LIVING. AND HE'S ANGRY TO BE SO YOUNG. AND HE'S ANGRY THAT HE MIGHT NOT SEE MATTHEW GROW UP. AND WHAT ABOUT YOU? ARE YOU ANGRY? SOMETIMES. I LOVE HIM COMPLETELY, BUT... THERE'S A PART OF ME... I FEEL WILL BE GLAD WHEN IT'S ALL OVER, AND THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY. I DON'T THINK YOU COULD EVEN SAY ANYTHING THAT TERRIBLE... OR THINK IT. I THINK WHAT YOU FEEL ISN'T TERRIBLE AT ALL. AND I THINK JONATHAN'S VERY, VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

AFTER THE BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT YOU HAD LAST YEAR, YOU WENT INTO A PARTIAL REMISSION AND THEN RELAPSED TO THE CHRONIC PHASE TWO MONTHS AGO. THESE LATEST TESTS ONLY SHOW WHAT I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW. YOUR SITUATION, UNFORTUNATELY, REMAINS GRAVE. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME? A FUTURE. I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT. IT IS, I FEEL, NOT IN MY BRIEF. HOW LONG WILL YOU STAY IN BERLIN? NOT LONG. - I WISH YOU LUCK. - I MAY NEED IT. HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GIVEN ME NOW? YOU GET 50 GRAND UP FRONT, AND 50 GRAND LATER.

AND WHERE DO I SHOOT HIM? JUST POINT THE GUN AND PULL THE TRIGGER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A BRAIN SCIENTIST. IT'S HIM. HE USUALLY WEARS THOSE HORRIBLE GOLD-RIM GLASSES AND A GREAT BIG FUCK OFF RUSSIAN FURRY HAT, YOU KNOW. THEY HAD TO KILL THREE BEARS TO MAKE THAT. NOW HIS NAME IS LEOPOLD BELINSKY-- A FUCKING RUSSIAN. HE LEFT MOSCOW A YEAR AGO AND SET UP SHOP HERE IN BERLIN, YOU KNOW, RUNNING PROSTITUTES AND DRUGS OUT OF HIS CLUBS. THE PROSTITUTES KEEP GETTING YOUNGER AND YOUNGER, WHILE THE DRUGS KEEP GETTING FUCKING HARDER. THIS SCUMBAG IS TOTALLY OUT OF ORDER. YOU TAKE HIM OUT, AND DECENT PEOPLE WILL CALL YOU A FUCKING SAINT. I LEARNED THAT ONCE A WEEK, REGULAR AS CLOCKWORK, HE VISITS THE ZOO. HE ALWAYS ENDS UP IN THE INSECT ROOM. THAT'S WHAT HIS REAL FRIENDS ARE. YOU KNOW, BUGS, CREEPY-CRAWLIES, SLIMY FUCKING THINGS, JUST LIKE HIMSELF. THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL FIND HIM. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THERE AT THAT TIME OF DAY. KIDS ARE ALL AT SCHOOL. EXCUSE ME, SIR. IT'S OKAY, I JUST CAME TO GET MY THINGS. NO, NO, NO, STAY. I'M JUST GOING. - HELLO? - HI, TOMMY! GUESS WHAT? YOUR WANKER, HE DID THE BUSINESS. YEAH. JONATHAN? HELLO. I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TILL MORNING.

WELL, HE SAID... NOTHING'S CHANGED. IT'S NO WORSE. OH. HELLO. HEY. BUON GIORNO. - HOW ARE YOU? - VERY WELL, THANKS. - YOU? - LIFE GOES ON. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING TO GO IN THE DOWNSTAIRS POWDER ROOM. - SARA SAID YOU CALLED 'ROUND. - YEAH. - WE MISSED YOU. - YEAH, SORRY. SHE SAID YOU WENT TO... WHERE? BERLIN? - YEAH. - YEAH? PRODUCTIVE TRIP? INTERESTING. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE? FOR A HALLWAY? NICE. - VERY NICE. - YEAH, I THOUGHT SO. MATTHEW, HAVE YOU-- HAVE YOU FINISHED? 'CAUSE WE NEED TO GET READY FOR WORK. BIG BOYS EAT THEIR CEREAL. PRONTO. UH, NO. NO. OKAY. WHO WAS THAT? - WRONG NUMBER. - WHAT, AGAIN? HMM. PREGO. NO, NO, NO, MORE. MORE. HOW YOU DOING? NO, MORE. DO YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT? - NO, THANKS, I'VE EATEN. - NO, MORE. HOW DO YOU FEEL? GRAZIE. ALL I WANT IS WHAT YOU OWE ME. THIS IS FUCKING FANTASTIC. PLEASE, MAY I HAVE THE REST OF MY MONEY? - THANK YOU. - MY PLEASURE. - YOU WANT SOME MORE? - MORE WHAT? MORE OF WHAT YOU FANCY. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF MONEY. YOU CAN TURN IT INTO ALL SORTS. LISTEN, I-- I COULDN'T. WHAT I DID, I WOULDN'T-- - I COULDN'T DO IT AGAIN. - THAT'S A FUCKING SHAME, 'CAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER 50 GRAND. AND I SUSPECT SO MUCH EASIER. AND I'D RATHER WE DIDN'T MEET AGAIN. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH MATTERS SUCH AS THIS. THE TROUBLE STARTS WHEN THE JOB IS ONLY HALF DONE. EVEN BASTARDS HAVE FRIENDS. EVEN DEAD BASTARDS. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - I'M JUST SAYING, YOU CAN'T GO RUNNING ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE, IF YOU DON'T EXPECT TO TIDY THINGS UP. NOT IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE. MY LIFE? WELL, I WOULDN'T GO ON ANY FAMILY PICNICS IF I WAS YOU, YOU KNOW? WHERE WERE YOU? I TOOK THE CAR TO THE GARAGE. IT WASN'T PULLING. MASSIMO SAYS IT ISN'T WORTH REPAIRING. GREAT. SO WHAT DO WE DO? WE... BUY A NEW ONE. WITH WHAT? LISTEN, THERE'S-- THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN KEEPING FROM YOU. I KNOW. THIS MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION, THEY ACTUALLY GAVE ME A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS. I THOUGHT I'D SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY. BUT I HAVE TO GO BACK. WHAT FOR? THEY'RE STARTING ANOTHER CLINICAL TRIAL WITH A NEW DRUG. THEY'D PAY ME AGAIN. - WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? - I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO WORRY. - 'CAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS? - NO, NO. JUST-- IT JUST MIGHT NOT WORK. BUT AT LEAST WE'D HAVE A CAR. JONATHAN, THEY WOULDN'T PAY YOU SO MUCH IF THERE WASN'T A RISK. THERE IS NO RISK. AND IT WOULDN'T BE FOR LONG. DON'T GO, OKAY? YOU DON'T NEED A CAR. HELLO. OH, SORRY.SCUSI. SCUSI. SHH. I NEED TO TALK TO YOU OUTSIDE. OH, FUCK. SCUSI. PLEASE, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SONG. CIAO. HELLO? I'LL CALL YOU LATER. HERE. IT'S A GARROTE. - YEAH, I KNOW WHAT IT IS. - SIGNATURE OF OLD BELINSKY. WHEN THEY FIND THIS 'ROUND THE NECK OF HIS CHIEF BUSINESS RIVAL, THEY'LL THINK BELINSKY'S BOYS DID IT, AND THAT SHOULD START A NICE LITTLE WAR BETWEEN THE UKRAINIANS AND THE RUSSIANS, LEAVING THE FIELD CLEAR FOR YOURS TRULY. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT YOU WANT TREVANNY TO STRANGLE A UKRAINIAN MOB BOSS ON THE BERLIN TO DUSSELDORF EXPRESS WITH A LITTLE PIECE OF DENTAL FLOSS? YEAH. WELL, MORE OR LESS. HE'S NOT THAT KEEN ON IT, BUT I THINK WE CAN TALK HIM INTO IT. HE'S NOT GOING TO DO IT. - NO? - HE DID IT ONCE. AND VERY WELL. ONCE IS ENOUGH. I WON'T LET HIM. - NO? - NO. GAME OVER. GAME OVER? WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? THIS ISN'T A GAME, THIS IS MY FUCKING LIVELIHOOD. I SAID NO. ALL RIGHT THEN. HELLO? Jonathan Trevanny. - JONATHAN? - Per favore lasciati un messagio. Vi richiemer. YOU SAID IN THE RESTAURANT IT WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER. YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT STRANGLING ANYBODY. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING SO BLOODY STUPID. I COULDN'T STRANGLE ANYBODY EVEN IF I WANTED TO. I MEAN, LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME! IT'S NOT A MATTER OF BRUTE STRENGTH, IT'S A MATTER OF APPLYING THE RIGHT PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT POINT. NOW YOU CAN DO IT, YOU KNOW YOU CAN. JONATHAN. FUCK. JONATHAN, WAIT! FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. JUST FUCKING DO IT. OTHERWISE... YOUR FAMILY'S GOING TO FUCKING DIE BEFORE YOU DO. DON'T FUCK WITH ME. THEY'RE COMING. HE TAKES THAT TRAIN TWICE A WEEK FOR BUSINESS. HE HAS PROSTATE PROBLEMS, SO HE SPENDS HALF THE TRIP IN THE TOILET. YOU'VE GOT A MASTER KEY TO IT. AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL DO HIM. YOU GOT A GARROTE, BUT YOU ALSO GOT A GUN, JUST IN CASE. BUT-- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, LISTEN TO ME. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. YOU HAVE TO USE THE GARROTE. LET'S BE OPTIMISTIC AND SAY WE WON'T NEED THAT. THE NOOSE, PLEASE. AND STICK AROUND, I'LL NEED YOUR HELP. THANK YOU.CIAO. HAS HE COME BACK YET? JESUS. THIS IS A NON-SMOKING CAR? HOW RUDE. LISTEN, IF HE DOESN'T COME BACK SOON, WE MAY HAVE TO WAIT TILL AFTER DUSSELDORF, THOUGH I HOPE NOT. AND, UH-- OH, WAIT. KEEP MY WATCH, 'CAUSE IF IT BREAKS, I'LL KILL EVERYONE ON THIS TRAIN. LISTEN, I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM INSIDE HERE TO MAKE MY ADJUSTMENTS, OKAY? YOU WAIT OUTSIDE, YOU SAY THAT YOUR WIFE IS IN THERE AND SHE'S VERY ILL. GO INTO THE CORRIDOR AND WAIT THERE FACING THAT WAY. WHEN HE COMES TOWARD YOU, YOU TURN AND YOU LOOK AT ME. YOU WALK THROUGH THESE DOORS AND STOP THERE, OKAY? NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES, JUST STOP, I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE REST. GO ON. I'M SORRY, MY WIFE'S IN THERE. SHE'S BEING SICK. TOM. JESUS, IS HE DEAD? I DON'T KNOW. GET HIS LEGS IN! TOM. TOM! TOM, THE OTHER GUY IS COMING NOW. - WHAT? ARE YOU SURE? - YES, HE'S COMING NOW. I'M SORRY, I DON'T SPEAK GERMAN. I'M WAITING. HELLO? HELLO? ANYBODY IN? IT NEVER USED TO BE SO CROWDED IN FIRST CLASS. WE COULD USE THIS. CAN I HAVE SOME MORE? JONATHAN, I DON'T WANT TO RUSH YOU, BUT THE FLIGHT TO MILAN LEAVES IN A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR. PLEASE, IT'S NO RUSH. I REALIZE I'VE HAD OVER 20 MINUTES TO ADJUST TO BECOMING ONE OF EUROPE'S MOST WANTED. AND I'M EXTREMELY AWARE OF HOW LUDICROUS I MUST SEEM TO YOU WITH MY HEAVING AND MY SHAKING AND MY POSITIVELY SHOCKINGLY AWFUL NORMALNESS. I DO HOPE THAT YOU WILL FORGIVE ME. I CAN'T LOOK AT MY SON. I CAN'T LOOK AT MY SON. I CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW I MADE $100,000. AND I FEAR, I REALLY, REALLY FEAR THAT I AM, IN FACT, ILL. I'M NOT WELL. I KNOW I SHOULD THANK YOU, BECAUSE I WOULDN'T BE ALIVE NOW IF YOU HADN'T HELPED ME, BUT I CAN'T SAY IT. I CAN'T SAY... THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU. WHO ARE YOU? I'M A CREATION. I'M A GIFTED IMPROVISER. I LACK YOUR CONSCIENCE. WHEN I WAS YOUNG, THAT TROUBLED ME. IT NO LONGER DOES. I DON'T WORRY ABOUT BEING CAUGHT, BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE IS WATCHING. THE WORLD IS NOT A POORER PLACE BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE ARE DEAD. IT'S NOT. IT'S ONE LESS CAR ON THE ROAD. IT'S A LITTLE LESS NOISE AND MENACE. YOU WERE BRAVE TODAY. YOU PUT SOME MONEY AWAY FOR YOUR FAMILY, THAT'S ALL. IF YOU LACK MY CONSCIENCE, THEN WHY DID YOU HELP ME ON THE TRAIN? I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. THE ONE THING I KNOW IS THAT WE'RE CONSTANTLY BEING BORN. WHY ME? WHY DID YOU PICK ME?! PARTLY BECAUSE YOU COULD. PARTLY BECAUSE YOU INSULTED ME. BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE THAT'S THE GAME. WE HAVE TO GET THIS FLIGHT. SHALL WE? WHAT'S GOING ON? WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? YOU-- - YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME. - TRY ME. - I WON IT. - YOU WON IT? YES. ROULETTE. - ROULETTE? - IN-- - SINCE WHEN DID YOU PLAY ROULETTE? - IN BERLIN. - DON'T LIE TO ME. - DOCTOR-- DR. WENTZEL, HE TOOK US TO A CASINO. WHAT IS THAT, SOME KIND OF THERAPY? NO, WE WENT IN WITH A FEW THOUSAND MARKS. IT'S TRUE. YOU WON A SMALL FORTUNE, AND YOU THOUGHT, - "I KNOW, I WON'T TELL SARAH. I'LL HIDE IT UNDER THE SINK." - YES-- WELL, NO. - I WANTED IT TO BE A SURPRISE. - WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH TOM RIPLEY? TOM RIPLEY. HE-- I MET HIM AT THE AIRPORT. HE WAS COMING FROM MILAN. HE OFFERED TO GIVE ME A LIFT. ANYWAY, DR. WENTZEL, HE HAS THIS SYSTEM. YOU PUT A FEW THOUSAND ON THE RED. - AND THEN IF YOU LOSE, YOU DOUBLE THE STAKE-- - DON'T LIE TO ME, JONATHAN! WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE DOING, I WON'T BE BLOODY LIED TO! - YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME? - NO. LISTEN, I GO THROUGH ALL THAT EXHAUSTING CRAP WITH DOCTORS AGAIN-- AGAIN, HOPING AGAINST HOPE, LOOKING FOR SOME GLIMMER. SOME GLIMMER! AND THEN I GET AN INCREDIBLE STROKE OF LUCK-- FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, NEVER BEFORE-- AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU, YOU ACCUSE ME OF LYING TO YOU! YOU ACCUSE ME OF LYING TO YOU! I MEAN, LOOK! I HAVE SOME MONEY. MONEY-- FOR YOU AND FOR ME AND FOR MATTHEW. AND MONEY, IT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT, ISN'T IT? MONEY IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT, ISN'T IT?! WHERE DID YOU FIND IT? IN A CHICKEN COOP OUTSIDE PISA. I HAD THEM COMPLETELY REBUILD THE LEGS AND STRIP ALL THE EMULSION OFF. I CAN'T, IT'S-- I JUST CAN'T. GIVE ME A MOMENT. STOP IT. NEVER TOUCH HER AGAIN. SHE'S TOO GOOD FOR YOU. I KNOW. - WHAT'S WRONG? - ONE OF THEM'S STILL ALIVE. - HOW DO YOU KNOW? - I HEARD IT ON WORLD NEWS. JESUS... I ALWAYS FIGURED YOU FOR A TALK-RADIO MAN. OKAY, I GUESS I DIDN'T STRANGLE HIM LONG ENOUGH. IT'S NOT LIKE A GARROTE COMES WITH A MANUAL. ONE OF THEM GOT A VERY, VERY GOOD LOOK AT ME. JONATHAN, THAT'S THE FIRST RULE OF THE GAME. DON'T EVER WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING YOU CAN'T CONTROL-- EVER. ANYWAY, I DON'T THINK THEY CAN TRACE US HERE. AND IF THEY GET CLOSE, I'LL LET YOU KNOW. BYE. WHAT ABOUT MY FAMILY? I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT MY FAMILY. WELL, DON'T WORRY. IF THEY COME FOR ANYONE, THEY'LL COME FOR ME. I THINK THESE BALKAN TYPES TEND TO TAKE STRANGLING QUITE PERSONALLY. YEAH? NEIN, NEIN!

SO YOU'LL STAY HERE BY YOURSELF THIS WEEKEND? ACTUALLY, I'M EXPECTING COMPANY. WILL THEY BE COMING WITH YOU TO THE CONCERT? NO. SOMETHING TELLS ME THEY'RE NOT MUSIC LOVERS. GRAZIE, MARIA. - WILL I SEE YOU THERE? - ABSOLUTELY. LISTEN, I'VE HAD SOME RATHER UNWELCOME PHONE CALLS. I WANT YOU TO GET RID OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HAVE MY NAME OR PHONE NUMBER ON IT. DO THE SAME WITH REEVES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? - WHAT'S HAPPENED? - DO YOU UNDERSTAND? - YES, I UNDERSTAND. ARE WE IN TROUBLE? - ONE OF US IS. ONE OF US ISN'T.

I'VE-- I'VE GOT TO GO AWAY FOR A FEW DAYS. I HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO SETTLE. I WANT TO FIX UP SOMETHING FOR AFTER I'VE-- I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO IT, NOT YET. WHAT THING? DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT? YES, WHEN I GET BACK, IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. IS IT ANYTHING TO DO WITH TOM RIPLEY? NO. JONATHAN. I'LL BE BACK IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, DARLING. LOOK, I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS. - WHEN I GET BACK. - GREAT. - WITH ANOTHER FAT ENVELOPE. - SHUT UP! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED SOME HELP. - JONATHAN, GO HOME. WHEN THEY COME, THERE MIGHT BE QUITE A FEW OF THEM. AND THEY WON'T BE BRINGING FLOWERS AND CHOCOLATES. I'M STAYING. WHAT DID YOU TELL SARAH? - AN ASSORTMENT OF LIES. - UH-HUH. DID SHE BELIEVE ANY OF THEM? NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF. WATCH YOUR STEP THERE. - WHAT ARE THESE? - MANTRAPS. - WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA? - YES, PLEASE. - DO THEY WORK? - DO THEY WORK? YEAH, I THINK SO. SHOULDN'T WE CLOSE THE GATES? NO, IF THEY'RE GOING TO COME, THEY'RE GOING TO COME. I DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE WHOLE REST OF MY LIFE AT THIS. - ARE YOU SCARED? - NO. I'M FUCKING TERRIFIED. COME ON. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T EVEN THINK TO ASK YOU, WITH YOUR CONDITION, - CAN YOU EAT MEAT? - YES. - I'M JUST NOT VERY HUNGRY. - YOU SHOULD EAT SOMETHING. YOU MAY NEED YOUR STRENGTH. THE MEAT IS FANTASTIC. IT'S FROM THE LITTLE BUTCHER'S SHOP JUST BY THE WAR MEMORIAL ON THE RIGHT. OUR COOK, MARIA, WAS ONCE QUITE INTIMATE WITH THE BUTCHER. SO SHE GOT SOME VERY NICE CUTS. DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET AWAY WITH IT? - WHY NOT? - I DON'T KNOW. I'VE JUST NEVER BEEN THE SORT OF PERSON TO GET AWAY WITH THINGS. AT SCHOOL, OTHER KIDS GOT AWAY WITH ALL SORTS. BUT NOT ME. I ALWAYS GOT CAUGHT. - YOU KNOW WHY YOU GOT CAUGHT? - WHY? 'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T THINK OF JUST KILLING YOUR TEACHERS. JESUS, THIS WAITING. I CAN'T STAND THIS WAITING. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY, I WAITED ON THE BEACH FOR HOURS FOR MY PARENTS TO COME BACK FROM A BOAT RIDE. THEY DROWNED. I COULD WAIT FOREVER. HELLO? HELLO, TOM, THIS IS SARAH TREVANNY. - IS JONATHAN THERE? - NO, WHY? Do you know where he is? - WHY SHOULD I? - BECAUSE I THINK YOU DO. I'm sorry, I don't understand. - I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON. - WELL, LISTEN, - I WOULDN'T WORRY. - DON'T TELL ME NOT TO WORRY. LISTEN, CAN I CALL YOU RIGHT BACK? NO, DON'T HANG UP, JUST TALK TO ME. I'M JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING. I MAY BE ABLE TO HELP. I'LL MAKE A FEW CALLS AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK. - PLEASE, WAIT! - Okay, bye bye. OH, YOU-- FUCK. NEVER GIVE FINANCIAL ADVICE TO FRIENDS. WHAT IF THEY CATCH REEVES? THEY'LL NEVER CATCH REEVES-- UNFORTUNATELY. HE'D TELL THEM ABOUT ME, WOULDN'T HE? PROBABLY. BUT HE'S ALREADY IN SOUTH AMERICA MAKING LIFE MISERABLE FOR SOME UNFORTUNATE PLASTIC SURGEON. SORRY. THAT'S YOUR BREAKFAST. - THEY DIDN'T COME? - NOT YET. STAY IN HERE. KEEP STILL. KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STAY INSIDE. IS HE DEAD? I DON'T KNOW. BUT AS WE KNOW, I'M NO EXPERT. JESUS CHRIST! IT'S THE GUY I SHOT! YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED DEAD THE FIRST TIME WE FUCKING KILLED YOU! - YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THIS OFF? - SHUT UP! YOU WANT IT OFF? DOES THIS HURT? I WISH HE'D STOP BLEEDING. DO YOU HAVE A PORTABLE PHONE? YES. - IS IT ON YOU, OR IN THE CAR? - IT'S IN MY POCKET. - GET IT OUT. I WANT YOU TO CALL THE MAN WHO SENT YOU HERE. I WANT YOU TO TELL HIM YOU GOT A VERY LONG LOOK AT THE TWO OF US, WE WERE DEFINITELY NOT THE PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? IF YOU DO THAT, YOU DO IT CONVINCINGLY, YOU WALK OUT OF HERE, WE GIVE YOU HALF A MILLION DOLLARS, OKAY? IF YOU DON'T DO IT CONVINCINGLY, I TAKE YOU OUT BACK, AND I RUN MY FUCKING TRACTOR OVER YOUR HEAD THE REST OF THE DAY. OKAY? YEAH. CALM DOWN. YEAH. YEAH. IF WE LET HIM GO, THEN... YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. JESUS CHRIST. SARAH. SARAH, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. WHAT HAPPENED IS-- WE KILLED HIM BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO KILL US! IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE! SARAH! DON'T TOUCH ME! LET GO!

AND COULD WE SEND OVER FOUR DOZEN, FIVE DOZEN IF YOU HAVE IT? I'LL DRIVE. LOVELY. THANK YOU MUCH. OH, YEAH? HOW IS HE? TERRIFIC. GIVE HIM MY BEST. THANKS AGAIN. BYE.CIAO. YOU KNOW THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING TERRIBLE? WHAT? OFTEN AFTER A FEW DAYS... YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER IT. THAT MAKES ME FEEL REALLY, REALLY GOOD. THE REST OF YOUR MONEY. - OH, NO, I DON'T-- - AS PER MY ARRANGEMENT WITH REEVES. IT'S YOURS. I'M NOT SURE ALL THIS WAS ABOUT THE MONEY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I DOUBT IT.
