TO llVE IN PEACE This story is not invented... the characters were real and even the village where the story was set is real. That time, the men were busy killing each others But the little village placed so high did not interest those who were making war The village was self-sufficient. The little church to baptise the new born... and the cemetery to bury the dead ones... the bell tower telling the time to the living ones. Francesco used to open his workshop every day... which spread a good smell of ham and mothball. Tonio opened on Sundays only. The priest looked after souls and taught children. The dedicate doctor, treated people and animals with the same love. And on those steps, the people were sitting every Sunday chatting. The Germans passed through here but left only a telephone and a soldier guarding a small depot. The political secretary together with the soldier... had the duty to stick the village's walls with terrible notifications. But this was not all. People were busy working. What are you doing? The child can do that. You know it's time to prepare the meal. -All right auntie. -All right, all right and nothing is fine though! You calm down! As if the Emperor of Japan is going to be borne! - Doctor, so? - All done - Male of female? - Fema le. Ls she already standing? What a darling! Did she suffered a lot? - No, just a little bit. - Well, they're cows! And now it's time to make the meal. - Yes, what shall l put in it? - Water and flower. Yes, l'll add also bicarbonate and mustard which helps her as a laxative. Yes, you've got to be careful. Hey uncle Tigna, will you buy a rocking chair for her? L'll buy it for you who are worse than a creature and stop calling me uncle. L don't like such attribute All right, l'll call you dad. Tell me something: rather than being funny why don't you go home? You know l don't like being home alone. Thing is you've got two options only... better being home than in a vagon that takes you to Germany. Did you get the drift? Fool! - Pellet! - My name is not Pellet but Silvia. - _m'on, don't get upset. - Stop it Franco, please. All right, if you ask me that way. Hey who's gonna give me some water? Do it yourself, can't you see they're working? No, it'd be too difficult. Give him some water as long as he stop it! As long as you stop it then. There you go! You could have told me at the least, l'd have kept my mouth open. Well, l'm gonna fetch it for you now. Thanks. Pellet? Do you know what have l discovered? W_r? Sometimes l've got so many things to tell you... but l'm not able to tell you, or l take too long time. Why is it like that? _me. Did you hear me? _m'on, l'm a friend! Got a cookie, for you. Lt's for you, take it. Who opened the door! Catch, catch that one! What's happening? That rascal trusts the German while she flirts with bums... and that cur's the worse of all. But auntie, Citto is not guilty if the German stops him every time he sees it. And as for Franco, you know he comes here as he goes anywhere else. Nobody's fault. And yet if it wasn't for the three of you these things wouldn't happen! - We'd be in peace. - You say so. You hear her? She's getting cocky. - She took after her mother! - W_r? All right, defend her, we'll talk about it later. L'm not defending her You come here Auntie _rinna is right! U nderstand? L don't want problems in my house. Do you want to put me into trouble? Don't you know that, if he goes mad he takes the flame-thrower... and burns everything! We're in the country not in the city - _rinna, _rinna, it escaped! - W_? - The black piglet! - What did l tell you? - Did it escape? - L saw it! - Which way did it go? - Towards the wood! Good on whoever catch it! - All animals are declared! - What do they care? You are the responsible politician, it's your problem. You end up in jail. But auntie, it was an accident! Go and get the piglet at once! L mmediately! And remember: either you come back with the piglet or you go away! You know what? l can't go on anymore. Have they got other relatives? They can go to them! - l can't go on like this! - Chill, they're just kids... We lost it. L don't think someone ate it! The dog found it! Easy otherwise it gets scared and we'll loose it again! Good day! - What do you want? - We came for that - ls it yours? - Yes. It's ours l'm sorry. But one who doesn't eat for two days doesn't think at all. But we've been looking for it since this morning. You can take it. l'll manage otherwise. - What's wrong with him? - A wound in the leg, infected. - Are you prisoners? - Americans. We wanted to cross the line but they stopped us - We're in your hands then. - What do you mean by that? Lf you return to the village and they know what you found... But we're not spies, you know? L'm sorry. Ls it bad? L'm afraid that without medicines he can't last long But you could try in some house. Lf they catch us, they'll send us right against the wall! Joe has shot to a German when we escaped. - Silvia! Silvia! - What is it? Nothing, it's uncle who's looking for us! - Good luck. - Thanks. And the piglet? Don't you take it? Lt doesn't matter. It's better if you keep it. Just a moment. What's your name? - Silvia. - L'm Ronald. Maybe we'll never meet again, Silvia. L wanted to thank you also for Joe. - Good bye - Good bye - The notification is clear. - What notification? That one outside. Didn't you read it? L can't read. L think they do it in order to scare the people... How can you kill a man like that? One doesn't have 10 lives. L don't believe it! Ls it not true? All is true! The notifications are true,... and the dead ones are true too. L say... they find a prisoner in my house without me knowing anything about and is it my fault? Right. Too easy. Anyone could say the same thing. One can say: you know, he came asking me some oil... Are you kidding? - But, have you searched well? - Yes grandpa, all over the wood! Well, l'm not gonna tell your uncle. You tell him. It's gonna be funny... Two American prisoners escaped. 10.OOO li ras rewa rd... to those who help to capture them. Anyone helping the prisoners... will be condemned to death and their houses set on fire including the neighbour ones. And the neighbour houses, what have they got to do with it? They're involved because...? Lt's a collective responsibility. - D'you understand? - L ca n't read. Everyone has got the duty to know what happens in their neighbour houses. It's in the public interest. But did you get he can't read? - luckily we live isolated. - Yes... we ca n relax. Just in case they burn our house only. Damn it! -Damn it what? -No, it's a way to say. Not towards them. So, it means than one has to mind someone's else business. U nfortunately. Ah, here come the vagabonds. And obviously empty handed. What did l tell you? The Miss went picking flowers up instead of searching for the piglet. Here we go again. L'm going not to hear you arguing. Auntie is right. _ming back almost at night! Did you regard home for an hotel? But you said that if we wouldn't find it... Shut up! l tell you one thing only. That if you turn up this time again... l shut the door and that's it. So uncle, you're not sending us away? Who, him? Imagine! You can burn this house down... loose the cow, the oxen and the trees. Just a moment! L beg your pardon. L tell you one thing only, to your room without dinner. L beg your pardon. Nothing. - Well, l'm going. - Ok. Tigna, remember to declare your animals. L did. Don't you remember l sent it along that half sack of grain? -Was there anything wrong? -Yes, it was all right but send another one. - Another declaration? - No, another half sack so it's one. Good bye. -He's the old trumpeter. -Bersagliere, l played the attack to Sarasha. Old Bersagliere. Good armed force, Bersaglieri. L t's the a rm of... What kind of man are you? Always quiet. Are you not ashamed? As if half wasn't enough. Now another half. Bravo! A bit mor.e and we'll be begging in the streets. Chill. Don't worry. They're temporary things. You know, l want to live in peace. To live in peace? How can anyone relax with a man like you? The first declaring the animals, the first declaring income taxes. You'd declare even your mother, even your wife. _m'on, say no! L can't because they don't want the wife in the income taxes. - Silvia. - What is it? - The American is nice, ain't he? - Sleep, sleep. How cute you look when you pretend to sleep! Did you take me for a fool? _m'on, stop this comedy. Thanks uncle. Don't thank me. l just don't want hard bread left home, that's all. Lt's necessary to save. And not a word to your auntie, 'cause l don't want. - U ncle. - What's the matter? What did grandpa take when he had the infection? A mix of solphatsz... Why? L pricked a finger. Let me see. - l can't see anything. - Lt's sore. Suck. Yes, hard. You're healed. Uncle, it's not for me it's for Citto. He hurt his knee. Always running. This is a real infection. What did he take... You rascal... Don't it. Tomorrow we'll take it to them. L take a piece to show l'm chewing it. All right. Tell me. Will that medicine be fine for black people? Of course. What kind of question is that? Shush! - _m'on you. - What? Am l taking it now? Yes, don't waste time. - When, tomorrow? - But l'm eating! Lt'll help you to digest. _m'on, open your mouth. - You too. - But it's not hurting now. You never know what could happen with infections. Here. Open your mouth. Here you go, dear. And tomorrow morning another _. No, l'll keep them otherwise you'll loose them. Eat now and go to sleep. Tomorrow morning l'll wake you up. - Eh, Tigna what are you up to? - You're not gonna have dinner, right? Eat, com'on! And tomorrow night no dinner as well! L'll bring the medicine tomorrow. - _rinna, _rinna! - What's happening? - The underpants! - What happened? - They flew away. - The wind? -No, the ghosts! Oh, holy virgin! L say, aren't you ashamed talking rubbish? No, g randpa is rig ht. Everything is disappearing in here. The cow is not making milk, the hens are not laying eggs... this is an haunted place! This is ridiculous. How can anyone talk about ghosts nowadays? Who took my tobacco? It was full. - Even tobacco. - Did you take it? - Took what? - The tobacco. L don't smoke, you know? - How is he? - He must have a high fever. - What does he say? - He wants me to go without him. He started saying that last night. It's like an obsession. What do you intend to do? L'm gonna try to find something in the village. The nights are getting colder and in this situation... a pneumonia can quickly take him away. L'd like to do something for you. But Franco hasn't come again. You did already enough. You better go. It's getting late. So, we'll come back tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow. Thanks. Tigna, Tigna! listen! _m'in. - Dis you shut the cattle shed's door? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - Yes, l am. Why? The ghosts, the ghosts, listen! - Oh my holy Mary! - Quiet! Citto, what is it? - Someone is coming. - Let's hide. - The door, the ghosts! - Did n't you open it? No, no me! Follow me. - Stop shacking. - No. - What are you doing? - You never know... l saw you. _me out or l shoot! There's nobody. let's go. Don't scream, it's me! Did you hear that? During the day with the trumpet, in the night with the ghosts... When will you let me sleep? Let's go! Damn, l touched you! Damn it! One is sleeping peacefully and all he needs are night ghosts! Tomorrow... l'll try to come and look after the animals. Silvia look! - What's up? Has anybody died? - He has to bless the stable and all. Please go on. So? Are we starting with the ghosts early morning now? Don Joaqu? n: have you got holy water to waste? Don't listen to him reverend father. Let's start with the stable. Yes, it's better. L'd like to know what's all this prank about. Lt's necessary otherwise the spirits invade us. Who cares! Spirits don't eat. let them be; at the least they keep us company. Here. This is it. And you? Don't you get in? Well, what are you doing? L'm scared. Oh! What for? As if the holy water is not enough. Now the prayers too? No, you don't go in 'cause you are wicked. You pray, pray. And you? What're you doing in here? Go away, this is not a theatre. Jesus! Who closed the door? Lt may been the spirit afraid of wind. Stop kidding, who closed the door? - lt might have been the father. - And why? To bliss the cow better. Reverend! Reverend! NO answer. What is he doing? He may be having breakfast. You know with a cow full of milk! Reverend. - You get in. - No. - You. - No. Reverend. - But why isn't he answering? - How can he, with a full mouth? OK, l'm getting in. _m'on, com'on, it's nothing. Were you scared? Scared... scared no. But it was the surprise. Open Tigna, open! Answer me! - Go in. - Why right me? -Because you're a man. -Ah, you remember that when it's convenient. All right. Open Tigna, answer me, what happened? But, he's an askari! (black soldier from Ethiopia) Open Tigna, answer me! - Are you the owner? - Yes. Forgive us if we got in like that but... we were scared of the rainstorm. My buddy is seriously ill. And had you come right here? Didn't you read the notification? - How is the Reverend? - He's all right, he's all right. - You tell her, Reverend. - Yes, we're all right my child. Well, now that the storm is over you can leave. He can't walk. How can l carry him around, in daylight? You're right. But the thing is that l've got one life only... if they find him in here, l can't just say that he's my cousin. Lf you go out they'd catch us. _m'on! You can't let a Christian being killed like that. L don't want letting killed anyone, Reverend. Why don't you take him to your parish? Ln the parish, how can l my child? If someone see him it's the end. And why, if they find him in here do they give us a prize instead? Well, he's in here already. And with a bit of caution... lf there were some rounds up, but thanks God, nothing happens around here. The thing is that in here, thanks heavens, too many things happen. _m'on! The only thing to do is calling the medical officer... so, the earlier he's cured the earlier you get rid of him. Ah, now the medical officer needs to know about him too! He does not speak a word, he's an old socialist! He can't stand the political secretary. -What is he doing? Fell asleep? -How is the Reverend? Dear Reverend! - Uncle Tigna, let us in! - L'm coming, coming. Pull him up in the meantime. -_m'on, speak. What happened in there? -Nothing You go to the doctor and tell him Tigna wants him. The doctor! What happened to the Reverend? You wait for him at the parish. It's the cow that is ill. - The cow, the cow! - Calm down! And you go to the attic and prepare a good pallet. And you stop being silly! Do you understand? He's mad! He wants to put the cow in the attic! - let's go upstairs. - Thank you sir. L can leave myself, if it's better. Lf Joe stays, you can invite the Fifth Armada as well. Get the blanket, com'on... Put the blanket on his head, like so. Give it to me... what are putting the blanket on my head for? - What happened? - Don't yell, calm down. - Who is it? Can l know it? - Nobody, there's nobody.. - Reverend you tell me, who is it? - Calm down my child, let's go. Lt's a friend. Actually they're 2. They'll be leaving in 15 minutes. - You tell her Reverend! - Yes, yes, yes! But l want to see him! Oh God, a negro! Calm down! He's not a negro. He's just a bit tanned! Are you mad? If the Germans know it they're gonna hang me! Calm down, calm down. -Are you gonna wash his feet? -What feet?, the doc needs to wash his hands. Uncle, how do you know when he's got dirty feet? But this one was born with dirty feet... l mean, black feet. Sorry! - ls he that bad? - No, it's nothing. Don't worry he'll improve. We got him in time. - Very well, very well. - Do you speak English? L used to know it but now l forgot it. These flies! Ah, the spirits not only were eating... they were wearing even my underpants! And my t-shirts. - What a disgrace! - Why are you so scared for an Askar? They're good. l met many of them in Sharasha After all, a week more or less... make sure to feed them well. One of these days l'll bring you a Partisan chief. - A what? - A Partisan. So that he'll sort them out on the mountains. Wouldn't be better to take him to the Partisan? What are these fears? You should be happy to have such a luck. -lt's a reason to be proud, a satisfaction. -Yes, yes. - See you. - Good evening Doctor. Don't be desperate my son. Lt's all in lord's hands. It's enough to have faith and all will be fine. One month for the Holy Virgin, some candles to Saint Anthony... and also some small things for the poor and for the lost souls. Uncle Tigna, did you get scared, eh? L wish they'd kill you! L'm sorry Reverend. No worries, it's fine 'cause these jokes are not funny. _me Franco, we've got the Americans. - We've got the Americans? - Yes, and one is black. Let's go to see him. -Yeah, tell everyone so we get a round up! -A round up? - Oh Mother, Mother. - Will you shut up? Always crying! - Well, l'm going. - Goodbye Reverend. Will you shut up? You'll put me in deep trouble. We've got a chief Partisan, the Grace of God, what else is missing? Tomorrow l'll go to the politica secretary to get information. Hello Tigna. Good day Mr. Secretary! What are you doing here? Don't you have harvest to attend to? Yes, but l've put some pieceworking people. L came to buy some things. Pieceworking people, buying. Business are good, no? No so much. That wine was too sweet. - Any news? - What kind of news? L mean... in short, What about the cannon shots? Ah! The cannon shots. Are you interested in politics now? No but, one hears about war, shooting and at some point... He needs to decide. Lt's logic that one has to be on one side or the other. No, l'm not interested in that. Lt's just a way to say, l mean, when will this disaster end. What disaster? , No, no disaster, l mean this nice war. - This War. - Yes, this War. Don't worry, it's a matter of days. L received precise information. In a few days the Germans... will mount a major offensive and will kick the Allies into the sea. Gosh! - Other news? - More than this one? No, l mean executions, rounds up... the rounds up for instance. Ah! The rounds up. Ln a few days l'm gonna order one. And why? Well, a round up here and then is good. Lt's useful to refresh the memory. By they way, was it you who did not believe to notifications and the like. - True? - No. Yes, it's true. L meant how could it be possible to punish people so hardly. Look at this. What do you think? Read, read. Have you seen this? Ln brvignano, few kilometres from here. Mister Ronald. Mister Ronald. Oh, good day Silvia. What a beautiful d ress. How beautiful is this morning! - Good day Doctor. - Goodness me what an elegance! - How is Joe? - Well. - Ha ppy? - Gosh, you're very good! Many alarms this morning? Hey, l'm talking to you, Silvia. One only, the German went strolling down to the last houses. The Reverend gave the signal just in time. Good Reverend, he's a conscious person and does always his duty. Silvia the swab please. - Don't you think they exaggerate? - No. These sort of things need to be done or not. Only this way German can win the war. Just between us, Will Germany win... What do you mean by that? No, l mean if the victory... That's it, stop it! Thank God l'm your friend. Because what you're saying can give you between 3 to 7 years in jail. - Why? - For political defeatism. - But l mean... - Enough! - Germany will win the War! - Good, yeah; may she win the war. L was trying to say... -Well, see you. -Where are you going? -Home l walk with you as well. Oh no, it's a very dusty road. But l need walking to keep in shape. Lt's not true. l come and go this way _ times a day... Iook what a belly! L need to go around this area anyway, checking the harvest... and see what happens, otherwise what sort of political secretary am l? L must be aware of everything. What a luxury! Is there a party today? Stop being fool and keep away. What if uncle Tigna see you? So? If the Americans stay here l can stay too! L don't know. You ask him. Little ball. L told you many times not to call me like that. Stop showing off just because you met an American reporter. Mr. Ronald is a kind and nice person, and he never calls me little ball. Here. Well, because he didn't meet you when you were fat like a piglet. L was not fat. And Mr. Ronald would have never said that to me. Oh God! But who will ever be this Mr. Ronald? He's an educated person who knows a lot; not an idler like you. Knows a lot. Of course. If you travel the world even an idiot learns a lot! But there is one thing that Mr. Ronald does not know. - lt's difficult - L'm sure. He doesn't know how good you look with that hair style. Let me work. l don't have time to waste like you. L understand. Take it. - Where are you going? - L'm going for a stroll. Since l'm trouble in here! Franco, Franco. By now he's completely healed. One week time and he'll be able to walk. -You mean, we'll be able to walk? -Lt's true, you must be tired to be here! L'll come back tomorrow. Goodbye. Good bye Doctor. What is it that doesn't make you sleep at night Mr. Ronald? What do you mean by that? My room is beneath the attic. L hear you walking, like last night for instance. Then, you were not sleeping too! L was not sleepy. Maybe it's because l feel like in a cage. L never stopped for so long in a place like this time. -Really? -Yes. l was a reporter for a newspaper. Today here, tomorrow there, always travelling the world. So you understand l got used to that. L'll ask the priest to borrow a book so that you can keep occupied. No need of that. There's a window in the attic, far better than a book. From up there l discovered many things l couldn't imagine. So that l thought to write a story. A story? Lt'll be the first true story l'm gonna write. L always wrote about things happening around, but never why they were happening. - And what is the story like? - L don't know well yet. L only know that it'll be set in a house like this... a life style that l like. Honourable people who know what they want... and a girl like you, and the war. A strange war where one lives as if in his best childhood memory. Forgetting that death is right behind the corner... ready to leap on you any moment. Lt's really a nice story Mr. Ronald. L'd really like it with an happy end. By the way, last year you didn't make me taste your white wine. Oh yes. No, it wasn't good. Lt doesn't matter. Send it to me anyway. All right, l'll send you a barrel of white wine... - No, no. - Ok, let's forget it. No, l say send me one white and one red so l can switch. When l see him my blood boils. Why, poor man. Poor man? On 25th of July he kicked me in the main square. No, no... nothing. L remember it. The first round up happening... You'll see what happens to him. He'll get it. And you too; try not to see him. Time may come when you pay the price too. Therefore, man advised half saved. Do you understand? Good day. Good day. L've been up visiting the little boy. Yes, he's recovering quickly. - He sings, walks. - Sings? - Yes, he's happy. - Yes, he always sings! L saw the notification in your house. 10 pounds to whoever hands a prisoner in. Gosh, if we come across one we'll do half and half... and we'll buy a pair of big boots. - ls it forbidden to spit? - No, it's not forbidden. - Bye Tigna. - Bye. Who was singing? Citto? No. The black man. Do you mean he was singing? Oi, make sure not to be seen with that guy... 'cause you know what l mean; when the others come, someone may make you pay for it. - Therefore... - Man advised, half saved. L can't deal with you or with that one. L'll stick with the black man then. Are you crazy staying out the house? Lf someone sees him l'd be in trouble. And why are you dressing so smartly? Uncle Tigna, the birds! _me down, come down 'cause the war is not finished! - w_r? - What "what"? - You tell him. - He doesn't understand. And explained to him he can't stay there with the birds... l don't understand. Damn it! Move, and you too. They may say l throw pebbles to black people. Damned the war and who invented it. What are you scratching? _me down. Eh, little ball. Silvia. - Can l help you? - No thanks. You know what l was thinking? That day when the German came... l was trying to tell you something but then the German came. Now l remember it. Maybe it's because l've been sitting on walls for long time. Yes, l noticed that. You see little ball, but when l used to see you as a boy... l felt a strange feeling; as if my legs were shacking. When you used to see me? - What have l got to do with that? - You've got plenty to do with that. Don't you understand what l'm trying to tell you? - No. - Oh well then... Mind this, one sees a girl and he gets those feelings not only... when he's sitting on walls but also when he's in Africa, in Greece or in the War. And in the end he realizes he must do something about it. What do you say Silvia? What you're like. To answer you l'd need to understand riddles. L played this tune in Sharasha. Have you ever been in Sharasha? Not to know. What do you mean? And Menelik? Did you meet Menelik? Not to know. And what kind of Askar are you if you never met Menelik? -Yes, yes. -And the trumpet? Do you know how to play it? - Not to know. - What "not to know"? L teach you. Blow, blow. Ah holy virgin! When will this story end? l'm not happy having blacks in my house. Did you hear what the political secretary said? -No, what did the political secretary say? -Ah don't you know what blacks do? - What do they do? - L'll tell you then. - U nderstand? - Ls it possible? Yes, and here... - Hell! - Lt's dangerous! - Also for me? - Obviously. - You exaggerate! - Lt's dangerous for everybody. -_m'on, it's dangerous for everybody... -You don't understand. Ln the granary there's the American, in the kitchen the black man... in the courtyard there's the draft dodger. It's worse than a barracks in here! You know what l think. l feel sorry for them, they're risking their lives. You feel sorry for everything. _m'on, be more human. Think that they've got a mother too... and a family who would be grateful if they'd know we're caring for them. - Mr. Ronald. - What is it Silvia? L'm sorry. L came to tell you that dinner is ready. Thanks. Did you work much today? Yes. Are you winning Mr. Ronald? Sort of. l reached a difficult point. Why? He realizes he loves the people who helped him. And last thing he wants is that something may happen to them because of him. What does he think to do? L doesn't know yet. L think that the people in the house would be sorry if something happens to him too. Lt's difficult carrying on yet. My character changed through the way. And l don't know what to do. Silvia, Silvia, dinner is ready. You've got to call her always. She doesn't even know the way. Ehi Ronald, l found the place, you know? Ah, really? Yes, nearby. It's a bit isolated. - Only it's a bit sad. - Lt doesn't matter. Lt's a little chapel in the cemetery. - l n the cemetery? - There's nothing better. Lf it doesn't go well, you know, we are in the right place. Listen boys, l mean, l don't want to kick anybody out, all right? L know Tigna but Joe is well now. Soon there'll be the Allies offensive and we want to wait somewhere else. The thing is that l reckon there'll be a German offensive instead. Franco, will you take me with you? Don't be daft. You've got time to g row up. But it'll finish then. And another one will start. L'm sorry. Enjoy your meal. When all is over we'll come back and be happy. Do you think of coming back? Yes, it's a lovely place here. L'd like to have a little house... near the wood, to spend some time during the year. Who knows if it'd be easy to get a piece of land. Near the wood, Ronald? Are you serious? -Yes. -Dead easy, the land is mine; l'll sell it to you for a pittance,... - Nothing grows in there. - Because you're a tramp. - lt'd produce a lot if you'd tend to it. - What an idea! Lt's the same idea you poor dad had and mine as well. One has no right to sell the land that someone else worked hardly. Only a rascal would do that. Yeah, right. One sweats all his life to grow a bunch of grass... U ncle Tigna, too many things happened recently. People have changed. But the land hasn't changed at all.

L'll tell you one thing: This doesn't end... the inescapable duties... -Ehi Miche '! -What? -Think of me too; don't take everything. The inescapable duties that will lead the homeland toward the highest destiny. -Miche ', please, get me some pumpkin. -Get lost. - What's happening? - The war is ended. There's a black man and a German hugging each others. - The war is finished! - Right, wait until tomorrow. - lt looks. as if the black man is not there. L'm going to look for him. Neg ro, socialist. Let me go. Tinco, Tinco, you enemy. You, Italian dogs. Are you still trying to bully us? You dirty coward! Ltalian dogs! To call the SS. Everybody "Kaput". Well, is the war finished or not? Yes Antonio, it's finished... What finished! Here is going to start. Where did the black man go? Good for him he got lost. What sort of jokes are these? First it's finished and then it isn't. _m'on guys, go home, go to bed please. - None can find Joe. - Where would he be? Maybe he hid in a haystack. L only found this. Where did the black man come from? L found him one day in the stable. L didn't even know it. Good, good to know. Tomorrow, tomorrow morning... - Go away! - Why? - Go to bed. - Giuseppe. Giuseppe come here. All right, thanks to... tomorrow he'll take care of it. Mary Virgin! What should we do? After he made a fool of himself, a phone call and his mates come quickly. And in a minute they destroy everything. Especially if they don't find the black man. Lt'd be good if you cannot phone ever again. Do you mean... Holy Jesus and Mary! And you'd want to kill a Christian like that? And would you prefer that this Christian hangs who knows how many people? And burn a lot of house? Can't you read? L know nothing. l go away. No, no, are you crazy? Do you want them to destroy the village? Maybe it's useless. Because if he doesn't answer the phone... his mates will come all the same. - Well, what do we do then? - Let's wait when he wakes up. With such hangover you may be won't remember a thing. Very well, but he remembers... He doesn't remember a thing. He knows that however it goes... he'll meet someone ready to make him pay for it. Isn't it true Secretary? Yes, yes. As for me, l saw nothing. He agrees as well. You, better if you disappear. Pack as much as you can and hide in the wood with your family. -What do you mean doc? Should l leave home? -Well, better the house than your life. Because if he remembers, he'll come straight to you. How can l leave my home? - lt's the only thing l have. - That's the way Tigna. What can you do? Tell me doctor, when he wakes up and doesn't find the black man. What's gonna happen? L don't know. They're hot tempered. What if they find the black man in my house's haystack. What happens then? What can l tell you son? Surely it's dangerous. L think it's better to go away. Yes, l take my family and disappear. Right. l'm not gonna wait for the German to wake up. Right us had to suffer such ordeal. How can you leave home like this? Oh god, what will happen now? They'll burn all, the stable, the furniture, all. There's no room in here. The wool socks for winter. How can l do it my god? The nice pillowcases when we got married. Stop it, by god. Why don't you yell a bit? You always yell when you're wrong and now you're right you cry like a sheep. _m'on don't cry, com'on. _m'on. Lt's just a bit of edginess, you know. L'm sorry for what's happening, Tigna. What can you do Ronald? It's this damned war. T At the least before it was between men. , But now it's children, women house that are involved. Let's go. _m'on. What happened? - Everybody left. - Where did they go? To the big square, waiting to see what will happen tomorrow. What fault did they have. If anyone l was the guilty one! By now everyone was compromised. - And didn't you go? - The doctor did not want to. He said: you've got to come walking. L don't mind but my wife... And you father? L have to stay to know what that one will think once awake. What's the deal? Here is the deal: if it goes well l ring 'Gloria' and everyone returns. - lf it goes bad l ring death knell. - Let's go before he wakes up. Tigna. Jump on behind. Let him in. Damned war! You can't relax even on the mountains. You work all life without harming anyone... and then some point you have to run away like brigants. Lt's my fault. No. Lt's men's fault who don't love each other. Those who left me the land worked it all their life... and l have to leave it to those who come after me. Lf it wasn't for them last night l would n't have left. Not even if they'd killed me. - Do you want some uncle? - No thanks, don't flatter me. By now you know everything about our house... there's only a true story that you don't know... about our family. The story of a beautiful girl like Silvia... who one day went away from here. The person who took her away was a bit like you... He wasn't American or a journalist but... he knew many things. He travelled the world. She was uncomplicated instead. Like these people. Their story began happily but ended badly. They were both young. They didn't know what could happen to them. Then he left her alone. He went away. And she, alone, away from him... died. That girl was the mother of Silvia, Mr. Ronald. - Tigna, he woke up. - Give me here. - Good morning my son. - Good morning. Did you have fun last night, eh? L feel, l... Are you feeling sick? Something do not remember. Uncle Tigna, many people. To shoot, to shoot, a horse. Horse! My son, it's not good overdrinking, otherwise you may hallucinate. A friend of mine, when he was drinking too much, could see dragons. - Dragons? - Yes, d ragons. One time, in the public square he was an elephant dancing. Good Italians! Priest. (German talking) All closed. None to walk.. - U nderstand? - Yes, today everybody away. But "to come back". Today there's procession with the Virgin, and candles. Understand? - You not to go? - No, l wait their return to the church. U nderstand? You cunning. You to stay here. Others to walk. Good, good. L to ru n. Not to stay? No l got to ring the bell, let (them) to return and then to come back. Ciao The bell. The signal! - To come father, to come. - What else is it my son? L to remember. - w_r? - L to see what. L don't know. A negro. A negro! Yes, who's talking? Yes, commandant. - l must go... - What happens? - What do you have to go? - L must go immediately. - Where do you have to go? - L to go Tinco house. What do you want from him this time, my son? - l know what to want. - Jesus, this time we're doomed. - What is it? - Death knell. Let's go back, com'on. Stop just now. You know what to do? Follow the other ones. Lt's dangerous. - l'll follow through. - No, l won't leave you alone. _m'on, go with the others. Otherwise the children get scared. l'll come soon. - Tigna, make sure, come soon. - Don't worry. What are you doing Tinco? Not to shoot, Tinco! L to speak, Tinco. Scared of this? Tinco... l've got something for you. Five kg of sugar. And you to have for me farmer cloth like this? Like the others. Understand? My commandant phoned. Allies to come, Americans to come... my mates to go away. Tinco, l don't want the war. War kaput. L want to work like you... Tinco. You want cloth to go away, do you? Guerra kaput. L'd give you the cloths. After all you didn't hurt me. Just a bit of fear. But did you see all those hanged showed on the papers? Yes. - Those wouldn't give you the cloths. - But l want to go back home, to work. Tinco. There's cloths over there but... l can't give it to you... lf you want, you can take it. You great friend. You help me like American and negro. Tigna, my Tigna! Uncle Tigna! Uncle! - Go and call the doctor. - No. - l t's u seless. - What did they do to you, my Tigna. L marched very drunk last night. Took the horse, crossed vineyards and met the Americans! L said Sergeant... l said Sergeant... -Look who is here! -Father! - look who is here! - Father! - Where's Ronald? - L don't know. - And Tigna family? - L don't know but they'll come soon. Don't cry. Think of how many poor sons die far from their homes. L instead... have all of you around me. The other night... l thought... that if l go first... my wife remains alone. Lt'd been sad. But now instead... l feel less sorry to leave you. Silvia... will get married... and you... soon... will be called grandma. Tell her to say grandpa... to love her much... like l wanted to. Ronald, say goodbye to Joe. Dear uncle Tigna... you've been for the both of us more than a father... Any Christian would have done it. Uncle Tigna, uncle Tigna! Jony. What's the matter uncle Tigna? Nothing. Germans shot him. Have you brought me chocolate? No. Tobacco. Citto stolen your tobacco. He took it to us in the wood. L brought this for you. Good. American tobacco. L'll smoke it... when... l'll be... better. Yes. You'll soon be better. When will you come back, Mr. Ronald? L don't know Silvia. The war is not finished yet. All those projects you had... Those are projects one makes once he forgets when it's time to leave. Without knowing when to come back. And that story you started? Won't you finish it anymore? No Silvia, it didn't finish well. Journalists are good writing articles here and there... but they don't know how to write good stories. Si Ivia... l will always remember you. Goodbye mamma. - Good bye Ronald. - Good bye Franco. Good bye uncle Tigna. This story is not invented... the characters were real. A few years passed since... Ronald from China writes articles for a New York newspaper remembering with nostalgia the house where Franco took the place of uncle Tigna Silvia is a woman and by spring she will marry Franco. Life flows quietly like it used to, and on those steps... people sit on Sunday chatting in peace.
