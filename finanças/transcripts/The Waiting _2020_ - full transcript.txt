This wasn't going anywhere. Why wait? I'll have the Luau. Actually, bring the whole bottle. And what are you having? - It's like 10:30 in the morning. - What was your name again? Eric.

You may know the boss's wife, - but we run a tight ship here. - Right, um, so, technically, I don't know her at all. My mom does. I'm just hoping that she doesn't hear about what happened today. Late on your first day is not a good look. Right. Steve, listen, I know you don't know me, and you don't owe me anything, but is there any way we can just let this slide? - Because I really need this job. - Then prove it. Some of us actually care about this place. Frankly, I don't know where to put you, we're fully staffed, but since you're so well-connected, why don't you start by helping Tanya in the lobby? Great. Okay, I'll do that. Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. I won't let you down. It's so great having you here, guys. Your room is going to be on the second floor. - We have different managers... - Tanya. Hey. Steve said you might need help over here. And you can check our exclusive boat trip packages anytime. How old is this hotel? - That's a great question. - That's a phenomenal question. You take this one. Alright. [laughing] I don't think I can do that again. Look, it's only every two weeks. Plus, once you do something long enough, it just becomes normal, you know? That gets normal? You either get used to it or you don't. I mean, the last girl lasted a whole three weeks. How does the room keep getting dirty if no one stays there? And why do we keep having to clean it? It's an angry spirit. And plus, it's hotel policy for us to keep the room clean. I don't make the rules. So how'd they die? I don't know, there's a rumor that she died in the room. She. Yeah. She's been stuck there ever since. I feel bad for her, actually. She's no angel.

I appreciate that, sir. And honestly, if you're ever, in the future, looking - for upper managers... - Don't push you luck. - Okay, okay. - Okay? I'll tell you one thing, though. You really want to impress me? You can find a way for this dump to make me a few more dollars. At ease, Dennis on. I'm just here to do some inventories. - But don't mind me. - Wouldn't dream of it, sir. Impossible man. At least he knows to dress for dinner. I'm going to do it.

Sure. So I've been talking to some of the housekeeping staff. Hmm. Charming, aren't they? But they keep talking about how haunted the hotel is. No, the hotel is not haunted. - Only one room is. - What? - You're serious? - It's a matter of local legend. I'm surprised you haven't heard of it before. No one appreciates the history around here. Can't even rent that room out. And that's the room I'm hearing the noises coming from, isn't it? Well, fortunately since housekeeping is not in your purview, you won't have to contend with our permanent guest. Although, we could use a refresher on your filing skills. Right. - It's a lot to take in, Steve. - Indeed. We've been having reports from other rooms lately, too. Flying lamps and the like. That's new. All seems to be getting more intense. Take that as you will. Now, you're not supposed to put your personal things in here, but full disclosure, I do it all the time.

[breathes in] [breathes out and door opens] [door closes] Sorry. I know, I deserve this. I just... I cannot stop thinking about you, Elizabeth. Are you even there? I don't even know what I'm saying anymore, it's... [sighs] I'm going to quit the job. I'm no good at it. I'm just tired of letting people down. You included. So, I'm going to go. I'll miss you. [phone chimes] "Don't go"? [light flickers] Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But it doesn't matter. Because they're closing down the hotel. Okay, listen. I'm going to make this work. I will sneak in after dark, every night. No matter what, I'm gonna see you. Okay? [birds chirping] Hey. Is everything okay? - No. - What's wrong? Michelle left. All she left was this note, didn't even say goodbye. I'm really sorry. I need this job and she just ditches me like that, I thought we were friends. You know, I get it. When my ex, Rachel, took off, there was no why, there was no where. Just vanished. Sorry. I don't know if that's the same as the Michelle... Yeah, I get it. - I'm sorry about your ex. - It's okay, it's just... It just blows my mind how easily some people can say goodbye. Yeah. So, do I need to befriend a ghost, too? - They seem to hang around. - Oh, touché. But unfortunately, this place is fresh out of ghosts. You're gonna have to find your own. - You're a good guy, Eric. - You're good guy, too, Sally. [both laughing] So... What are you going to do once they shut down the hotel? I don't know. Probably sneak back in every now and then. - But they're tearing it down. - What? Yeah, I have a friend who works for the demolition company. He told me. Sally, I am so sorry. I have to go, though. [door opens] Elizabeth. Hello? Where are you? Eliza... Hey. Hey. Hey. We really need to leave. I need you to trust me, okay? We're gonna get out of here. Come on. It's okay. ♪ [door closes] You can't leave, can you? You're stuck in this room forever? What if the room suddenly wasn't here? Because that's where it's headed. Delacourt sold the hotel. So, they're gonna tear it down and the room's gonna be gone. [crickets chirping] Yeah, I'm going to miss this. God, just if we could have one more chance, you know? Just try one more time. We'd make it work. Well, then again, with my track record of relationships, it's probably best you get rid of me now. It's just hard to find something real, you know? Till recently, I didn't even think that ghosts were real. Sorry. Hey. You are going to wait for me in the after-life, aren't you? [silently] No. Devastating. Well, you better. Because I am way too good to pass up. [light flickers] Isn't there something we can do? I've tried, but I burned up all my capital with Delacourt over dinner. - Now, you, on the other hand. - Me? You and Delacourt, you're his new favorite. Maybe we can use that. How about you set up a meeting with him, we can tag-team him on the idea of selling the place to me? You actually have the capital to buy this place? This place is cheaper than you might think given the paranormal activity. It will let you spend more time with Sally. Okay. I'm in. [door opens] [door closes] [light flickers] Okay, so I found a way. We set up a meeting with Delacourt, we convince him to sell the hotel to us. We become part-owners, the hotel doesn't get torn down, everyone can stay, meaning you, meaning we could be together. There's no more waiting. And everyone... ♪ [light flickers] Ready? Ready. Mr. Delacourt, hi. Good to see you, um, that looks healthy. Right, um, so Steve and I have been talking, and we think that we've come up with a good business proposal that will both save the hotel and make you money. Is that's so? For too long, we've been hiding our biggest assets. Right. See, because I don't know if you know this, but people come to the lodge not because of the amenities, which are great. They come because of the story of the hotel, - because of its history. - And you have to admit, there's a certain thrill and charm to its current supernatural status. Right, so we're thinking, why aren't we capitalizing on this, instead of shying away from it? I think the lodge needs to play to its strengths, you know? But we have to talk about this now. Just let this land on Steve and I's shoulders and, uh, you'll have cash in hand soon. Intriguing. You two are, uh, are very creative. Thank you. And I promise you that if you allow me to do this, I will, we both, will not let you down. Of course. Now, for God's sakes, why don't we get something to eat? - It's on me. - Yeah, oh my God. I'm starving. Thank you. Well, guess who decided to show up. I... I've got somebody here I want you two to meet. Sean. Hi. What... What are you doing here? That's Mr. Davis. He just bought the property. Um. I don't follow. Sean, you... You actually bought the hotel? On the condition of levelling the place. Mr. Delacourt, you promised Eric you would hear our proposal. Look, I promised you both that you'd have a job with my company. I didn't promise you'd be working at the lodge. It took everything I had. But it's done. It's time to let the past be the past. And Elizabeth will be free. Uh, Elizabeth? Okay. So am I to assume, then, that this is already a done deal? Come on now, son. What's done is done. I mean, we signed the papers this morning. Now you've got to get over this old lodge stuff and start concentrating on being a new executive at Delacourt Hotels. Is something wrong? No. No, I, uh... I can't let you do this. You can't let me do it? Son, you've got a lot to learn about business. And I'm starting to rethink about you. - It's a pity. - It's better this way. She'll be free from that room, free from that place. My debt is paid. What the hell is going on here? Did I miss something? Don't make any rash decisions. You know, this is your career we're talking about. And I appreciate you looking out for me but just keep your damn job. ♪ [door opens] [door closes] Bravo, Elizabeth. Bravo! I see, you've been having fun with Eric. You had one damn job, and you screwed it up. Is this because I kept you in the room longer? Because I did it for both of us. Now I was very clear with you. You scare people till the price of the hotel hits dirt cheap. And I would bring Sean Davis to release you or whatever. I don't ask questions. Your little boyfriend managed to gum up the works. Sean just blew me out of the water. And you were supposed to wait for me to handle these things. I would have gotten the job done. You couldn't wait just a little bit longer. I've been waiting for 15 years. Couldn't let it go another week. Now I'm glad you started haunting other rooms but it wasn't enough, you stopped halfway through. You know, I could have brought Sean here any damn time I wanted to. He wasn't hard to find, for the living anyway. Guess, you got your way in the end. I guess, I can't even be mad that you didn't deliver. Because here's the thing about closure, sweetheart. It doesn't exist. Things never work out the way you think they will. Don't say I never taught you anything. Oh, they're going to level this place as soon as the permits go through. Thought you ought a know.

I overheard the whole thing, he's been torturing her for years to try to bring down the price of the hotel. Sally, you're sure of this? He promised her that he was going to bring in the guy who she was in love with. I guess she thought it would free her. Hey, - You lied to her. - Lied? I thought it could work.
