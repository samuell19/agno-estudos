-What's wrong, Nab? Maybe you're pregnant! -What? When you were in the Netherlands, you sent a photo to me. Who else did you send the photo to? Just you! I'll return to Indonesia and I'll continue my life there. [in English] Do you still love Doel? [Zaenab] But were you hoping to meet Sarah? I was hoping to meet my son, Nab. What's his name? Dul. You're back in Jakarta, right, Dad? Can I stay at your place? -Stop! -That's crazy, miss! Darn it! You don't know what your Dad's house is like. What's his house like, Mom? [Sarah] We both love the same person. One of us has to be brave enough to make a sacrifice. We'll go to the doctor this evening and have you checked. [traffic roaring] ["Si Doel Anak Betawi" by Armada playing in Indonesian] [cock crowing] [birds singing] Why is the motorcycle still out here? Whatever. Assalamu'alaykum. [Atun] Wa'alaykumussalam. You're home already? Yes, I just got home, Mom. Go take a bath! You smell sunburnt! I will. I want to rest for a bit first. I'm tired. Slow down, container truck! Don't surprise me! Your face is scary enough as it is. Look who's talking? You're even scarier! Watch it. It's my turn to take a bath! I've gotten so sweaty, waiting for your mom! Who's taking a bath? I want to rest! I just got home and I'm tired! No need to rest! Take a bath now! Then fill the water up again, since your mom used it all! Hurry up! No, I'm going to change my clothes first. Hey, puffer fish! [disgusted scoff] Always has an answer... His mom is no different! Using up all my water! Hey, hurry up! -[Atun] What's wrong with you? -What the...? Gosh... I haven't even taken a bath, and I'm already wet. -You'd better watch it. -Wait. [Dr. Wirawan] Congratulations, Mr. Doel. Your wife is pregnant. With Zaenab's condition, she needs to rest a lot, OK? Because her womb is still weak. I'll prescribe a strengthener, and also some vitamins. But mainly, please avoid stress. Don't overburden your mind. I'll try. -Thank you. We'll be going now. -You're welcome. Thank you, Doctor. [Dul] Mom, who is Mother Zaenab? [somber music] Mother Zaenab is my close friend. We've been friends for a long time. We're like family. If she's your close friend, why is she living with Dad? Mom. May I know? The reason Dad left us? Dad never left us, honey. I was the one who left him. Your dad is a good person. A very good person. I'm the one at fault... because I left your Dad. Is it because... Dad fell in love with Mother Zaenab? No. They fell in love... after I left your Dad. Oh, yeah, honey. I won't be able to take you to your Dad's place tomorrow. I have to meet someone to take care of some matters. After I'm done with them, I'll go straight to the airport. Mom. You don't want to meet Dad anymore? You don't want to meet Mother Zaenab? No. I don't need to. OK, then. You should go and pack. Check again. Make sure you don't leave anything behind. Yes, Mom. [sad music] [Sarah] I've also asked Doel... to quickly finalize our divorce, so that I can be at peace. So that you can be at peace. I want to see you happy, Nab. What is it, Nab? You've been spacing out, and you haven't said a word. It's as if you're not happy about our child. Anyway... You shouldn't overthink stuff. The doctor told us you shouldn't let yourself get stressed. When is Sarah going back to the Netherlands? I don't know. Why? Will she be visiting us first? I don't know. Is it true that... she's asked you to finalize your divorce with her? Is it true? Yesterday, Sarah told me... that she's asked you to divorce her. When will you do it? As soon as I can, Nab. You know that I've just returned to Jakarta. -I haven't had time to take care of... -[vomiting] [coughing] [muttering] Hey. Why are you snacking on it? -I'm already hungry, Mom. -Be patient. Wait for the others. -Your fat reserves won't run out. -But I'm hungry. Be patient. [Doel] OK, stop here. Thank you. Don't you dare eat it. Whatever. I'm going to eat. I'm hungry. It's bad manners to leave food uneaten. Nab, how are the results? You're pregnant, right? Doel, she's pregnant, right? Doel. Alhamdulillah, she is. Alhamdulillah. Finally, you're going to have a child. But why aren't you both looking happy? We are happy. But we're not that young anymore. -Are you expecting us to jump around? -You're right. Go and tell Mother then. Yes, we'll tell her. OK. I'm going to get the food ready. -Thank you. -Right. Let's go. [crickets chirping] Doel. Aren't you bothered by how kindly Sarah treated us? We've disappointed her. We've hurt her feelings. But she forgave us anyway. Enough of that. That's all in the past. Maybe for you. But for me... this is just the beginning. Try to think about it from Sarah's point of view. Not ours. In your eyes, maybe you think Sarah's the one at fault. For leaving you, her husband, without giving you a chance to explain what had really happened. But try to imagine: these 14 years, she gave birth to your son, and she raised Dul all by herself, not getting remarried. She faced all of that alone. [sniffs] I feel guilty. Even after you asked me to be by your side to help take care of Mother, it turns out... none of that can make the guilt disappear. It's actually worsened my feelings of guilt. This guilt will never go away. Nab. Don't go creating those feelings. And don't force those feelings to remain in your heart. I never created those feelings. Those feelings came to be because of how Sarah acts toward us. There's only one thing that can erase my guilt. You need to go back to her. [emotional music] I've already told Sarah... that I will accept it... -if she wants to reunite with you. -Nab. What are you saying? I'll take care of everything. I just need time. I don't want you to force the issue. I'm not forcing you. I just don't want... to be haunted by this guilt forever. Now that there's this child, our child, I want to have peace. I don't want to lose another child. Let this child be the one accompanying me. Forgive me. Maybe I shouldn't be saying all this to you. Bi. Eat at the back. Bring your plate. Yes, Mom. Nab... why did you say all that to him? Give him time to think first. To decide what's best for you both. [wistful music] [crying] Nab. Don't cry. If Mother hears, it'll cause even more trouble. Why did you even have this fight? Doel won't choose anyone else! We're not fighting. We're just trying to figure out what's best for everyone. But if I stay here, I'll just feel emptier. You can't give up! Even when Sarah married Doel and became my sister-in-law, I was still rooting for you, Nab! You can't lose! It's not about who wins or loses. It just feels like the love is disappearing. Flying away. I'm really angry at Doel right now! I hate him! I don't want to get trapped by the same mistake. I have to save my child! If I stay here, I'll always feel that I've done Sarah wrong. It's time for me to be happy. So, you want to leave Doel? You're pregnant. It's just not right. It's a sin to ask for a divorce. I'm not asking for a divorce. I just want to live peacefully so that I can raise my child. By leaving this house? If that will let me live peacefully... and give Doel time to think and make a decision... maybe it's best if I leave this house. What if Mother asks about you? I'll go talk to her. Hopefully she will understand. Hopefully, Sarah will drop by before leaving for the Netherlands, so that I can talk to her first. After I have that talk... I'll leave this house, Atun. Well... if that's your decision, what more can I say? But if I can give you a suggestion, you need to think about this clearly. Don't decide emotionally. Here. Thank you, Atun. Psst. [mouths] What's wrong? Doel. Doel? There you are! I was looking for you. I wondered where you were hiding. [laughs] Hey. Zaenab was crying. Were the results negative? She's not pregnant? I know you! You would be celebrating if she were. Hey. If someone is talking to you, pay attention. Don't just stare blankly. For guys, no pregnancy just means it's not the time yet. As for Sarah... It's a good thing that Zaenab's not pregnant. Are we going to keep living like this? If you were back with Sarah, at last our lives would change! We would live the best lives. Our futures would be great. Atun and I could come live with you! Right? Aren't you embarrassed to freeload all the time? -What's with you? -Doel. In the meantime, let Zaenab sleep in my room. -So she can have some peace. -What? Sleep in your room? Are you her husband? Not all pregnant women want to be with their husbands. And what does that have to do with Zaenab? She isn't pregnant, is she? Yes, she is! Oh, my gosh. You didn't tell me. I've talked so much and you kept silent? You should have told me. So, what are you going to do? -Sarah. -Hey. Starting now, stop mentioning Sarah. What? Don't you know that Dul, his son, is going to stay here? His mom will be taking him here. So, Sarah and Zaenab are going to meet! -We can't say her name even then? -That's an exception. After that, don't mention her name again to Zaenab. Pretend that they don't know each other, so that Zaenab can have peace and want to keep living here. If not, she'll leave. So, what are you going to do about Sarah? -Are you going to get a divorce? -Be quiet. Stop talking already. -What? -It's giving me a headache. Why are you angry at me? You should be thankful to me for giving you some input. At least think about this: who do you want to be with? Sarah or Zaenab? Doel. Don't go to Zaenab now. Let her sleep. Go to Mother. She was asking for you. -Tell her about Zaenab. -Yes. -You're so noisy. -Hey, do you know? Is Doel choosing Sarah or Zaenab? Better put the motorcycle in. And stop asking questions. -Assalamu'alaykum, Mother. -Wa'alaykumussalam. -Have you eaten yet? -I don't feel like eating right now. How are the results? Is Zaenab pregnant? Alhamdulillah, she's one month pregnant. Alhamdulillah, Doel. Finally, you and Zaenab are having a baby. Alhamdulillah. Where is Zaenab right now? I think she's already sleeping. She felt sick. Her head was aching. Maybe she's exhausted. She might have a craving or something. You're right. I'm going to go pray, OK? OK, go on. Alhamdulillah. [wistful music] ♪ Killing me softly ♪ ♪ Killing me softly now ♪ ♪ Now killing me softly ♪ ♪ Killing me softly now ♪ Where are you going so early in the morning? Ah! Oh, right. Since you're not going anywhere, I'm going to use your motorcycle to earn some money. I'm running out. I barely have any left. Who's going to feed me? Not going to drive the oplet anymore? What? Using the oplet to make money? It won't get me money. It will just suck away all my money. ♪ Killing me softly ♪ Atun, is Zaenab awake yet? She was. After praying, she went back to sleep. Let her rest. I can make this by myself. Where did you sleep last night? With Mother. Doel, when Dul gets here, where is he going to sleep? If possible, not in your room, please. Poor Zaenab will feel depressed. So, where is he going to sleep then? Let him sleep with Abi. I'll tell Mandra to sleep out front. Dul won't be here for too long anyways. As if Mandra would want to sleep outside again. I'll do the talking. Doesn't this motorcycle have any gas or what? [funny music] -Where is it? -Here it is! You can see his lips even from here. See? -Assalamu'alaykum! Mandra! -Wa'alaykumussalam. Keep rubbing that bike and a genie will come out. [both laugh] It's still early in the morning and you're visiting already. -Relax. Come here. -Yes. If I come in the morning, I won't bring bad luck. I always bring fortune. Even when I was born, someone brought a bedug drum. This is Maulana. He's here to check out Mr. Karyo's house that's for rent. -[with accent] Assalamu'alaykum. -Wa'alaykumussalam. [giggling] -I'm guessing you're from Makassar. -How did you know? [laughs] -From your accent. -His pronunciation? -Yes. -Just like a Javanese singer. Were you serious about what you said to Zaenab? Of course. Zaenab really hates you. She's furious. Doel, I'm just afraid that she can't stand living here. She's happy about her pregnancy. She's taking real good care of her child now because of her miscarriage before. It's just that she worries too much. You should take her to a doctor. To a psychologist. There are mothers who do weird things when they're pregnant. It's so cold! Hurry up and get dressed! You'll be late! Yes, Mom! It's cold! -I'm going. -OK. Lift it a bit. There you go. Wow, look at this house. The living room is huge! All right. Whoa. The garden. How about this side? It's big, right? How many rooms are there? Rooms for what? For him to sleep in, of course! Or maybe for circus? How many rooms do you need? We can arrange it all! -Two rooms, if it's possible. -We can do that! We could divide the room in two. Here and there. Done! [laughs] So, if I rent this house, I have to build the rooms myself? Oh my gosh. You still don't get it? Are you here to rent a room or rent a house? Right. I want to rent a room. Of course! Then just divide the room into two to fit your needs. You want to be in the front, or the back, in the room, or near the bathroom. Problem solved, right? Let me explain. I was smarter than you in school. Mr. Maulana wants to rent a house that has rooms. He's not here to measure rooms. So, if he rents this, he has to build the rooms himself? That's to fit to each person's needs. If he's still single, or has a lot of kids, we can arrange it suitably! Well, it's up to Maulana. Do you want to build the rooms yourself? I'll think about it first, then. Assalamu'alaykum. [both] Wa'alaykumussalam. What's he doing? Tell him not to take too long! -OK! I'll tell him. -Or someone else will take this house! So, that's the concept? If someone wants to rent this place, they have to build their own rooms? If I have to build the rooms, there'll be no margin for me. -You're quite smart there. -Right? But don't forget my commission fee, whether he takes it or not. If he doesn't, I don't need to pay you! But I already worked hard! And I'll be losing money! Go home already! Hey, the money. Even ghosts like money. All you want is money. Just go! Useless. Don't cause trouble at your Dad's place, OK? -Don't be naughty. -Yes, Mom. Are you sure you don't want me and Dad to take you to the airport? You don't have to, honey. Just send my regards to Grandma. Tell her I'm sorry I can't come because I'm very busy. OK? OK, Mom. Don't forget to call me. I'm sure that I'll miss you a lot. -OK? -OK, Mom. -Mr. Yono. Could you help me, please? -Of course. Mr. Yono, after you drop off Dul at his dad's house, -come back here right away, OK? -I will. Remember. Don't cause trouble. Yes, Mom. [laughs] -I'm going now. -OK. [in English] I love you. I love you, too. Bye! -Assalamu'alaykum! -Wa'alaykumussalam! [in Indonesian] Even squirrels have rooms. And there he is. -The Ninja Turtle. -Hey. I'm going to school. OK. Kiss my hand. You'll help me, right? I already told you to just walk! You're so troublesome. -Come here! -But it's far!

[sighs] Can I borrow money? I'm driving a motorcycle taxi. -It's to buy gas. -You're always borrowing money. I'm out of cash. Once I get some again, I'll pay you back! -It's just a little. -You haven't even repaid your last debt! Just give it to me. -Fifty-thousand rupiahs. -Here. [hums] This is only 20,000 rupiahs! I only have that much! I haven't started selling yet! What's with you? [whines] Hey. When Doel's son gets here, let him sleep in the room with Abi. You sleep on the terrace, OK? No, I don't want to. Hey, you know what? In the Dutch language, it's "nehi"! What are you saying? That's Indian! Not Dutch! Oops, wrong country. [laughs] Oh, well. Assalamu'alaykum. -Wa'alaykumussalam. -Stop acting smart. You've been to the Netherlands and still got the language wrong. Nab. Nab. Wake up. You haven't had breakfast yet. You need to take your medicine. [groans] Come on, wake up. You need to take your medicine. Careful. [hisses softly] [gags] -Come on. -Sorry that I slept in Atun's room. It's OK. I understand. Here. I made eggs for you. Come on. Come. I'm going to get some warm water, OK? [clears throat] Careful, it's hot. I'll get your medicine. Have you eaten yet, Nab? What? Yes, I have. Uh... Sorry I didn't help out in the morning, Atun. -It's OK. Just rest. -Here's the medicine. Doel, help me open up the shop. I'm getting the snacks out from the oven. A customer might come. They might want to order already. OK. -I'm going. -OK. Uh... I can get the snacks. It's OK. Just rest. Or accompany Mother. She was asking for you yesterday. [wistful music] [grunts] [cock crowing] Alhamdulillah, the shop's already open. -Excuse me. -Assalamu'alaykum, Doel. Wa'alaykumussalam. What would you like to buy? I'm not buying anything. I'm picking up my order. -From Atun? -Yes. I'll go tell Atun, OK? -OK. -Wait a second. [humming] [motorbike approaching] Wow. TAXI BIKE STATION Wow! Back up. Smart boy. [laughs] You're already starting to work! Of course. I also need to make money. -What is it? -Why is there no one around? What? You're late. I've already gone all over the place this morning. You just need to wait here. -Ouch! -Oh my God! -That wasn't on purpose! -Watch your leg. [moaning] That hurts. Here. Use this application. I haven't registered yet. Do I register at the district office or somewhere else? What? You think you're making an ID card? Whatever! Let me borrow your phone, OK? As if I'd let you borrow it. I'm sorry to say... But your rusty motorcycle chases the customers away. You're so arrogant! Next month, I'll buy a new one! One that doesn't even have a brand yet! What motorcycle is that? It doesn't have a brand yet. How should I know? [laughing] OK. That's cool. -Who's my driver? -That's me! -To Haji Zairin Street. -Ready to go. -Mandra! It's you! -Yeah? -Yeah. -When did you get back? It's already been a while. I thought you'd be rich, coming back from the Netherlands. But you're still doing this. But relax. When this land is sold, you'll get a part of it. You won't need to work for a week! So, pray for me, OK? Hey, Grandpa. -Are you getting on or not? -I'm getting on! Pray for me, OK? -OK. -Come on. You're all talk. You'll promise anything. -Hi, Dad. Good morning. -Morning. What are you doing? Washing the car. -Abi already went to school? -Yes, he left in the morning. -You're not working today? -I will in a bit. Soon. -Sir. Your suitcase. -Yes. Thank you. -Drive safely. -Thank you. -Let's put your suitcase in. -OK, Dad. -Meet your Grandma first, OK? -OK. -Leave your suitcase here first. -OK. Come on. Mother. Your grandson's here. Grandma, I'm here. Hey. Who did you come with? I came by myself. Your Mom didn't come? She still has a lot of things to do. But she sends her regards. She's sorry that she can't come here, because she's going straight to the airport this evening. She's flying back to the Netherlands? Yes, Grandma. On the night flight. -OK. Have you had breakfast yet? -Yes, at home. -Doel. -Yes? Take your kid to his room. OK. Dul, you'll be sleeping with Abi. -But the room is small, OK? -It's all right, Dad. -Come on. -Grandma, I'll be going. OK. Meet Atun first. -Aunt Atun. How are you? -Dul. I'm fine. Your Mom didn't come with you? No, she still has lots to do. -I see. -What are you doing? Making snacks. That's a lot. For what? I'm selling them. -You're going to sell them? -Yes. The shop in front is for selling snacks? Yes, people also buy them to be resold at the market. Oh, right. Where's Aunt... I mean, where's Mother Zaenab? She's in the bathroom. -That's the bathroom? -Yes, that's the bathroom. So, if you want a bath, you have to get the water first from the well over there. Come in. This is Abi's room. For now, you'll be sleeping with him. You sleep on the top, and Abi will sleep on the bottom. He can't climb up there. -Yes, Dad. -OK? OK. I'm going to finish up washing the car. -And also watching the shop. -I'll help you after changing my clothes. All right. [Atun] I feel bad that Dul has to sleep in Abi's room. It's hot in there. [Doel] It's OK. There's a fan. So he can also learn something. Atun. -Dul already came? -Yes. By himself? Not with his Mom? No. He said that Sarah was busy. Oh... [cock crowing] -Good morning, Mother Zaenab. -Good morning. -Uh... You came by yourself? -Yes, by myself. -Your mom didn't drop you off? -No. She's busy. When is she going back to the Netherlands? This evening. So, she has to be at the airport by the afternoon. I'll be at the front. I'm going to help Dad wash the car. [downbeat music] Dad, let me help you. I'm almost done. It's OK. Let me finish it. -OK, then. Here. Finish it. -Sure. What car is this, Dad? It's called an oplet. [birds singing] What is this car for? Why are the chairs long and facing each other? Why aren't they facing the front? It's for public transportation. For passengers. Public transportation? Yes. Like a taxi. [serene music] -Good morning. -Morning. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Dad. I like looking at your house. Have you been living here long? Yes. Atun and I were born here. -Great-uncle Mandra was born here, too? -No. Mandra was born in the neighboring village. Oh, yeah, Dad. Are all Betawi houses like yours? No, not all of them are like this. There are better ones, too. No. Your house is also great, Dad. It's distinctly unique. [laughs] Good morning, Mrs. Sarah. Morning, Mrs. Ranti. -How are you doing? -Fine. -Let's go to my office. -OK. Please come in. Please come in, Mrs. Sarah. Thank you for your time, Mrs. Ranti. Not at all. I was just surprised that you called so early in the morning. So, what can I help you with? It's like this, Mrs. Ranti. I need your help to take care of my divorce with my husband. We've both agreed to get a divorce. If both of you agreed to get a divorce, it'll make the process easier in court. I'll prepare the divorce papers. Is that OK? -Please do. -Could I borrow your identification card? Here you go. Please wait for a bit. -Assalamu'alaykum. -Wa'alaykumussalam. You're looking after the shop, Doel? With Atun. What are you looking for? -I want to buy sugar and flour. -Right. -Sugar and flour, right? -Yes. -Anything else? -Salt, too. -Salt? -Yes, salt. -Here you go. -How much is it? -How much? -Dul. -Hi. -It's 22,000 rupiahs. -Thank you. -Yes. -Can you handle it? -Sure. If you want to drive the oplet, go ahead. -I'll look after the shop. -You're feeling better? I'm fine. You should take Dul with you. It'll make him happy if you ask him to come with you. Dul. Yes? Can I have your Mom's phone number? What's her number? What for, Nab? To wish her a safe flight before she heads back. Can I have her phone number? Of course. -Type it in, please. -OK. Here. -Thank you. -You're welcome. You should go. Take Dul around Jakarta. I'll feel bad if he has to stay at home the whole day. Help your Dad by being the driver's assistant. -Driver's assistant? -Yes, driver's assistant. What's a driver's assistant, Dad? Hold onto this. Come on. Let's drive around. Let me. I was so unlucky last night. I was taking a passenger and ran out of gas! You lack control. -I'm better than you. -There's Opie. -Alhamdulillah. -You look happy. Well, well. You're starting to work, Mandra? I'll pray that you get lots of passengers. As your friend, I'll even climb the roof to pray for you. I'll be lucky if the bats up there don't bother me. Right? Amen, Mr. Mustache. -But I feel sorry for Mandra. -Sorry for what? He's only attracting flies. No one wants to get on his bike. [laughing] It wasn't me who said that, Mandra. That's why you need to get a new motorcycle. If you don't, you won't get any passengers. Because they won't even see your bike. They'll mistake it for rice cake. [laughing] Must be sticky. Enough, enough! Stop acting all smart just because your motorcycles are nice. My motorcycle is ugly. That's fine! That's not what we mean. We've already told you. You need a new motorcycle. Don't blame us. Yeah. I need a ride. [humorous music] What kind of person is that? There you go, Mandra! [laughing] Thank you. Alhamdulillah. Come on, sis, bro. No, I don't want to ride that. I'm scared. I want to ride that one. That one's already had a passenger! This hasn't yet. Take turns! But I don't want to. So snobbish! You jerk! What did I say? The passengers have a preference. Right? -Whatever! -That's enough. -It'd be a waste if he doesn't get a ride. -Take him. -Come on, sir. -OK. I'll take you. [instrumental "Kicir Kicir" playing] Dad. Hmm? How come no one's got on the oplet ever since we left home? Well, we have to be patient, son. But rest assured that... Allah will always take care us. Just so you know... By driving this oplet, your grandfather could pay for my college fees. Until I got my bachelor's degree. Until I became an engineer. [emotional music] I really appreciate your assistance. I will do my best. [somber music] [cell phone rings] Hello? Hello. Sar? It's me, Zaenab. Uh... Sorry if I'm disturbing you. I got your number from your son, Dul. Uh... Do you have time to meet me? I want to talk to you. What else is there to talk about, Nab? We already talked about everything last time. There are still other things that I need to tell you. Sorry, Nab. Why should we even meet again? There's nothing to discuss anymore. And I truly don't have enough time to stop by your house before my flight. -Maybe we can just talk on the phone? -Sar. I'm pregnant. [dramatic music] As a graduated engineer, I used to work in a big company. It was in the heavy equipment business. I worked there for a while. But after I married your mom, I resigned from the company... because we were starting a new company. But unfortunately, that company shut down. Why did it shut down, Dad? [downbeat music] Did it shut down... because Mom left you? Can I ask you something, Dad? What is it? Is it possible... for you and Mom to reunite? [dramatic music] I really want... you and Mom to be together again. And to live with us again. Is it possible? [dramatic music continues] -It's screwed. -Unemployed. I need a ride. [birds singing] [humorous music] You're working now, right? We are. She won't want to ride with you, Mandra. Your motorcycle's rusty. She'll choose me for sure. I only want to ride with him. I need to pay my debt, too. You don't mind driving me, right? Sure! [stammers] But my motorcycle's old. That's all right. As long as you'll drive safely. -Please, take me to Anggrek Street. -Yes! [laughs] It's my blessing. [upbeat music] [motorbike revs and splutters] -Be careful, OK? -Of course. Oh, no, it died. What's wrong with your bike? Is it running on jelly? [giggles] Please, be patient. -[motorbike revving] -[laughs] Here we go. Hold on, OK? Bye! She's pretty. Born in a hospital for sure. -Yes. -Unlike you. You were spat out. What am I, a lizard? [laughs] [emotional music] I'm asking you... to reunite with Doel. Let me be the one to leave. You're the one that said... that between us... someone has to make a sacrifice. I don't want you to make that sacrifice. I've realized... [sniffs] ...that Doel can't be completely mine. [sobbing] You're the one who deserves him more. I'm sincere in letting him go, Sar. Like you... I also want to live peacefully. I don't want to always be haunted by guilt. I just want to raise my child. I've already lost a child once. I don't want that to happen again. [emotional music continues] After this, I will talk to Mother. And Doel. And after that, I'll return home. I'll leave. Right. [sobs softly] Thank you for making the time to meet me. I hope... that you'll rethink your decision to have the divorce. For the sake of your son. Dul. [sniffs] [stifled sobbing] -This is for the motorcycle ride. -Wow. And this is for my debt. What debt? The oplet fee. No, I'm fine with it. I just wanted to help. -It's OK. -I'd feel bad. No. [giggles] Really, it's OK. A debt has to be paid. I also wanted to say thank you for helping me. If you had not passed by, I'd have gotten into a fight with him. With your husband? [laughs] Husband? I'm still young. I'm not married yet. [giggles] Sorry. I thought he was your husband. Your boyfriend, then? Boyfriend? He used to be. But now... [laughs] Oh, my. Poor boy. [both laugh] Gadis! What are you chatting about out there? Ask your friend inside! Munaroh? Mandra? Who is she to you? She's my Mom. Oh... [emotional music] Mandra, how are you? I'm fine. [giggles] She's your daughter? Yes. She's my daughter. You know him, Mom? I do. He's my old friend. Right, Mandra? We're old friends. Yes. Very old friends. So old that we're rusty all over. [both laugh] OK, then. I'm going in, Mom. -OK. -Thank you. -Yes. -OK. Is she yours and Cecep's daughter? Yes, she's Cecep's daughter. [giggles] -She's really pretty like me. -Don't speak nonsense. I mean, she's pretty like her Mom. Well, it's already late. I'll go now. Send my regards to your husband. My husband's no longer with me. My condolences for your loss. When did he die? He isn't dead. We got a divorce long ago. [giggles] You and Cecep divorced? Yes. Well, then. It's already late. I'll go now. Yes. Thank you for giving my daughter a ride. You're welcome. [laughs] But seriously, could I visit sometime? The doors are open for you if you want to come by. Alhamdulillah. Thank you, this is great. OK, then. Assalamu'alaykum! Wa'alaykumussalam. Drive safely. OK! [giggles] [whispering] This debt's not paid yet. -Thank you, sir. -You're welcome. -Assalamu'alaykum. -Wa'alaykumussalam. -Doel isn't home yet? -Not yet. Why were you in such a rush earlier? You didn't even say goodbye to Mother. Mother asked for you. -OK. I'll go to Mother right now. -Go on. [emotional music] [sighs] -Assalamu'alaykum, Mother. -Wa'alaykumussalam. [emotional music] Where were you? You usually never leave without telling me first. Yes, I'm sorry. Because I had to... How is it? Are you done with what you needed to do? I'm done. Thankfully, it's done. Mother. I... I want to apologize to you. You don't need to apologize to me. I'm the one who should apologize for troubling you. I heard you when you were talking to Sarah. I heard you when you were talking to Atun. I also heard you when you were talking to Doel. I heard everything. Alhamdulillah... you're finally going to have a child with Doel. Take good care of that child. It's Allah's blessing. [emotional music] Yes, Mother. Inshallah, I will. I understand if you want to make this decision. I won't interfere. It's all in your hands, Nab. It's your right. It's OK. Just talk to Doel. I'm sure he'll understand. I don't want you to leave. But if you want to go back to your Mom's house, and clear your mind, that's OK. I just have one piece of advice. You shouldn't ask for a divorce when you're pregnant. It's a sin. Mother. I... Thank you so much, Mother. For understanding how I feel. For understanding my condition. Thank you so much, Mother. All right. You should pray now. Yes, Mother. I'll go pray now. [emotional music continues] [whispering prayers inaudibly] -I don't have any more debts, right? -Right. How about tomorrow? I'll take more. There's going to be a Quran reading. -Thank you. Assalamu'alaykum. -Wa'alaykumussalam. -Go take a bath, son. -Yes, Dad. Alhamdulillah. Where are you going, Nab? I'm going home to my Mom's place. Why are you suddenly going home? What's wrong? [somber music] I've just met Sarah. I've talked to her. I've asked her... to come back to you. I've also talked to Mother. I've asked for her permission to go home. It's not my intention to run away from you. Let me go home to my Mom's place. We both know that we need time to think about all of this clearly. I have been happy, living together with you. I've never regretted it. I'll also take care of this pregnancy that I've been waiting for. But it feels like... I... can't bear to always... have our love overshadowed by your love for Sarah. I can't bear to always be... just the shadow of the one you love. I'm sorry. Let me take you home. You don't need to. You know how my mom is. We don't want the drama. She'd get all angry. Just let me go by myself. The online taxi will be here soon. -[man] Is Doel home? -[Atun] He is. Just come right in. -Thank you. -Right. -Assalamu'alaykum, Doel. -Wa'alaykumussalam. -How are you? -Healthy, alhamdulillah. That's great to hear. -Zaenab, how are you? -I'm well, alhamdulillah. -You're going somewhere again, Doel? -No, I'm not going anywhere. Oh, I thought you were going abroad again. Carrying that luggage. The car's already here, Doel. -Atun. -Where are you going, Nab? I'm going to my mom's house. You're really going? See you, Atun. Stay strong, OK? Be careful. -Thank you. -Yeah. I hope you understand my feelings. I do. Send my regards to your mom. Doel. So what are you going to do? I hope you can be considerate. Where is Zaenab going? Why didn't she just ask me to take her? No need. She can go by herself. What is it? I want to invite you to work at my company. I need an experienced mechanic. I hope that you can help me. Dad. Mom wants to talk. Hello? Hello, Doel. I just wanted to say goodbye. I'm already on the way to the airport. I'm leaving Dul in your care. Send my regards to Mother, too. Tell her I'm also sorry because I can't stop by there. Doel. I already took care of our divorce. I've entrusted it to my lawyer. I hope you can accept my wish. It's best that we separate. [sobbing] And also... I met Zaenab. Alhamdulillah. You're both finally having a baby. Congratulations, Doel. OK, then. I just wanted to tell you that. Send my regards to Mother. And don't forget to finalize our divorce. [Sarah sniffles over phone] Have a good afternoon, Doel. You, too. [emotional music] Here. I think you should just go home, Ahong. It's still one big mess right now. I'm also confused... that Zaenab is leaving. I don't know. I think Doel and Zaenab might be splitting up. You mean a divorce, Atun? [dramatic music] -Assalamu'alaykum. -Wa'alaykumussalam. Where have you been, Nab... What's with those big bags? Hey, it's as if you were kicked out by your in-laws! Where's your husband? He didn't take you here? Where's Doel? I'll tell you about it later. Tell me later? Nab! Did you get into a fight with your husband? No, I didn't. -Good news! -Mandra! Soul mates will always be there. I'm back! The point is, I have good news! You've got to accept it. I'm getting back together with Munaroh. -What are you saying? -It's all right! [laughs] I'm going to ask for Doel's blessing. Don't. He's got a lot on his mind! -He's always like that! -Zaenab just left! -She left? -She went to her parents' house. Oh no! This is bad. Wait, she went home... when she's pregnant? -Don't be so loud. -Whatever. What's important is that I'm going to propose. No way I'm canceling this. Doel! Doel, you can help me propose, right? -This is important. -Atun, is Zaenab really pregnant? Yes, she is. You'd better go home. Come back here another time. -Yes. Assalamu'alaykum. -Wa'alaykumussalam. ♪ Munaroh, I've fallen in love with you ♪ [laughs] ♪ Munaroh, Munaroh ♪ [giggles] Who's Munaroh? You keep saying her name. You've made me curious. Little kid, don't get involved in the matters of adults. You're always like this. Hey. It's not like that. We're happy if you have a go, too. The special one, just like playing marbles. And I've never seen you with a girlfriend! I've had lots of girlfriends! -[both giggle] -But just one lover. Just say that it's Munaroh! Munaroh, right? -You want to know? -Right? [wistful music] Doel. Did Zaenab already go to her Mom's place? She already did in the afternoon. You can't be angry at her, Doel. She already talked to me. Let her go for now, so she can think clearly. She's a good person, Doel. I'm sure that she'll listen to you. Whatever you do, you need to be fair. Don't just do what you want. In this life, we can't be selfish. We shouldn't just do what makes us happy if that makes others suffer. If you're going back to Sarah, go ahead. I'm just reminding you... that Zaenab is pregnant with your child. You can't divorce her when she's pregnant. That's a sin. Just talk to Sarah. I'm sure she'll understand. But if you really want your wife to be Zaenab, hurry up and finalize the divorce papers with Sarah. Don't leave her hanging. Let's eat again. I'm done, Doel. -Let's just drink, then. -OK. [crickets chirping] [Mandra] The point is, whenever you have time... you help me propose. Stop by her house. You stop by first and then propose to Munaroh on my behalf. That's what I mean. What are you saying? You're so oblivious to people's feelings. Doel has a lot on his mind! Don't add into his problems! And you've only met Munaroh once! Does she even want to be with you? [dramatic music] Of course she does! I understand when a woman wants to be with me. They give certain signals. When I was leaving, she said... "Mandra, I'm no longer married." -She said that. -[car approaches] You just made that up. [car door closes] We have a guest. Just ignore them. See who it is first! You go! Why me? He hasn't given me an answer yet! You said you're going out anyways! Don't be so lazy! I asked Doel and he hasn't given me an answer! Dad. Mother Zaenab left because I'm here, didn't she? It has nothing to do with you, son. Come on, let's eat. Doel. You have guests. They said that they're lawyers... that Sarah hired. [whispering] Go. See? I forgot. I'm going to be late. -Please wait a bit, sir. -OK. -He's inside. -OK. -Please sit, sir. Sit. -All right. [Mandra] I'm going to be late. In the name of Allah. [motorbike revving] -Hello. -Hello, sir. You're Mr. Kasdullah? -Yes, what is it, sir? -Let us introduce ourselves. We're Sarah van Heus' legal counsels. This is our power of attorney. Our reason for coming here is to retrieve the marriage documents of yours and our client's, so that we can quickly register your divorce. [wistful music] Mr. Kasdullah. According to the information from our client, you have agreed to have this divorce. Therefore, we've already prepared the agreement letter of divorce for you to sign. Here are the documents. LETTER OF DIVORCE We understand if you need time. Because of that, you can hold on to the documents. And you can read through them first. We hope that you can contact us soon, no matter what your decision is. Here is our card. Thank you, sir. Have a good evening. Good evening. [sad music] [heavy sigh] [lawyers' car leaves] [indistinct whispering] ["Hanya Rindu" by Andmesh playing in Indonesian] [Doel prays indistinctly] Dear. Say hello first. Hi. Hi. Maybe you won't believe me, but he's always asking who his Dad is. And he really wants to meet you. Papa Doel! [Dul cries] [still crying] Sorry. I'm sorry. [sighs] This is Dul, your grandson. He looks just like Doel. Alhamdulillah. [crying] Your house is also great, Dad. It's distinctly unique. [sighs] ["Hanya Rindu" by Andmesh continues playing in Indonesian] Cinere, Gandul. Cinere, Gandul! Miss, go ahead and have a seat. -Dad, I'll look for some more. -OK. Sir, have a seat. Cinere, Gandul! -[Doel] I know... -[Dul] Cinere, Gandul! ...that one day, I will have to make a decision. And when I make that decision, someone is going to get hurt. Forgive me. I only hope... that I can finish our story soon. [crickets chirping] Let's go to the mosque, Dad. -Have you done wudu? -I have. -Let's go. -Dad. Do we have to go to the mosque to pray? If we're going to pray with others, we have to go to the mosque. We could also do it at home, but how could we when my room is so small? You're right. You really look like a Betawi kid, wearing those clothes. Of course. I'm Sabeni's grandson, after all. [laughs] Let's go. -Dad. -Yes. Even though... I really wanted you... to come back to Mom, and live together with us... But... even if... you divorce Mom... I won't be disappointed, Dad. Even if it will be hard for me. And I... won't be mad at you. Mom told me... that this is all... her fault. Mom was the one that left you. But Mom never told me... the reason why... she left you. She only told me... that I'd understand one day. Dad. I only ask for one thing. Please, don't hate Mom. And still look at me as your son. Forever, Dad. Come on. Let's go to the mosque. [bell tinkles] Hi, Mom! Honey, you're here already? Had I known, I'd have picked you up at the airport. I didn't want to trouble you. And I wanted to give you a surprise! ["Kepastian" by Wizzy playing in Indonesian] Doel? Come. Doel? Why did you come here again? I had to take my son home. [birds singing] [steps approaching] [knocking] Assalamu'alaykum. Wa'alaykumussalam. [door creaking] Why are you even here again? Uh... I want to meet Zaenab. Why do you want to look for Zaenab? It doesn't matter anymore. Zaenab isn't here anymore. She left. You've really crossed the line, Doel. You know she's pregnant, and still... Mother Ipah. I already know who I want to choose. Liar! You always said that you'd divorce Sarah! But you haven't yet, right? Here's the proof. Here. CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE [emotional music] Zaenab's not at home anymore, Doel. I also don't know where she went. I forbade her to leave. But she insisted on leaving. I'm worried about the baby. Even though Zaenab is not my biological child, she's still pregnant with my grandchild. Do you have any idea where she went? I'll look for her. I also don't know where she went, Doel. I'll look for her until I find her. I'm sorry that I've troubled you. Yes, Doel. -Assalamu'alaykum. -Wa'alaykumussalam. [crying] [uplifting music] Doel? Doel? Did you come here to pick me up? Yes. I came here to pick you up. Let's go home. I took care of everything. I promise that I won't hurt your feelings again. ["Hanya Rindu" by Andmesh playing in Indonesian] [Doel] Allah, please forgive all my mistakes. I hurt the three women that I love. Sarah. Mother. And Zaenab. This story has gone on for 27 years. And now it's time for me to end it. I only hope You'll bless my choice, Allah, so that this will be the best for everyone that I love. THANK YOU FOR FOLLOWING DOEL'S STORY FOR 27 YEARS FROM TELEVISION SCREENS TO THE SILVER SCREENS ["Hanya Rindu" by Andmesh playing in Indonesian]
