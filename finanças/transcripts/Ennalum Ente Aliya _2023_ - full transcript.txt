Ah! All the results are favourable. - Did you take the injection? - Yes. The next three days is the ovulation period. Should try to have contact as many times as possible. Even we are prone to the lifestyle and work stress here. But you'll have to let go of that for something like this. Been eight years since you got married, right? Yes. It's not enough to just wish for a child. You have to be mentally prepared for it as well. You should perhaps get away for a couple of days. To somewhere like a resort... ...for a change of surroundings. But, it's your choice. Consider, the next few days as your second honeymoon. Okay? God bless! Thank you. Alright, then. See you. - Listen. - Hmm? Why don't we go somewhere like the doctor said? Where to? A friend of mine has a resort. It's really good. Nah. Let's stay at home. But Balu, make sure you do this one thing. Ignore your calls and destress for a few days. Okay? You picked up everything right? Medicines? - Yes. We'll pick it up downstairs. - Let's go this way. "Shadows, don't go too far away!" "I wander lonely at night." "To light lamps in the darkness," "won't you come by my side?" "The sea in my heart, the waves of which have disappeared..." "...searches for daylight." "Till the dark clouds fade away" "the embers in my heart burn!" "Shadows, don't go too far away!" "I wander lonely at night." "To light lamps in the darkness," "Won't you come by my side?" "The sea in my heart, the waves of which have disappeared..." "Searches for daylight." "Till the dark clouds fade away" "the embers in my heart burn!" "My dreams have vanished." "Agony, could you go away too?" "To sing a lullaby to a little child," "I wait here with desire" "at the deepest of the valleys!" "With a trembling heart," "I search for the path ahead!" "Shadows, don't go too far away!" "I wander lonely at night." "To light lamps in the darkness," "Won't you come by my side?" "The sea in my heart, the waves of which have disappeared..." "searches for daylight." "Till the dark clouds fade away" "the embers in my heart burn!" Balu! Balu... what are you doing? Balu! See you, Balu! Saw that? Learn something from them! What was that about, Balu? Following the doctor's advice? Doctor's advice? Shut up! Give me an answer. Come sit. Listen... you know my... you know everything, right. Work pressure. Just stay there. So... The next three days, like the doctor said... no clients... no phone calls. For sure? Yes. [Doorbell rings] Who's that? [Doorbell rings] Hey! My brother-in-law! Wasn't expecting you here. Where's my sister? What's up with you? You there, Sis? Oh dear! Can't bear this heat. Wait. Didn't you go to work today? No. Gosh, I really can't stand this heat. - Sis! - Hey. What happened to you? Your face looks weird. Nothing. Nothing at all. Hey! How come you landed up without even a call? Where was the time to inform?! That guy landed up out of nowhere. - Who? - That useless room-mate of mine. He wasn't supposed to return for a month! - Oh. - I lost space in my room. The only relief is that... I can relax for a few days with my sister and brother-in-law. - Where is the TV remote? - Remote... here. Can I get a cup of tea? White or Black? - White! But with fresh milk. - Okay. - Do you want tea? - Nope. Any idea when the cricket match starts? - What? - Cricket match. - No clue. - It's supposed to start now. Whew! [Cricket commentary on TV] Yes! [Cricket commentary on TV] Oh, no! [Sounds from TV] Darn! He was playing so well! You said you're on leave today. Why waste a leave? Give him tea. Here. Hey! Didn't you take the day off? Did you attend that interview for the supervisor job? It's too hot outside! I'll get burnt! The only shade here is when a plane flies above! You know I'm a Civil Engineer, right? What a shot! You better take the day off. The game is so exciting. Come here. Your visit visa will expire soon right. What's the plan? There's still time left for that. Ah! This is life. Haven't had such good tea since forever. Feed him something. Aren't there any other snacks? Shut up and have it! It's always these biscuits! Balu... Don't forget to buy fresh milk on your way back. Only if you want to have tea tomorrow! [Sounds from TV] Hey Ismi! Ismi! Hey! Ismi! Hey! Ismi! Turn that off. - What? - Turn that damn thing off. Oh God! The only time I have peace is while praying. And you won't allow even that. Haven't I told you not to create nuisance like this? But I was playing it on low volume. Great! Now you've gone deaf as well. Oh God! What kind of clothes are these? What happened to the sleeves? I cut those off. Cut those off? God! What if someone sees you like this? Mom, this is my room, my house. Who is going to see me? Sure. Your room! Don't you have anything to study? Don't you? Don't you have anything to talk about other than studies? Study. Study. Study. Don't forget about today evening. What? Isn't Jesna your friend? Weren't you talking about getting a gift for her wedding? Yes. Yes. - Call Dad. - Yeah, yeah. Else, he'll be stuck with his concreting... Haven't I told you not to bring my phone at this time? Hey, it's me. Just switch off the lights! Why is he shouting at me? Close the door! What happened? - Why is he acting like this, Sis? - What happened? His phone was ringing on the table. I just gave it to him. Oh God! It's his meditation time. Who asked you to give him the phone now? How would I know? His boss was calling. Thought it was important. But he is acting crazy. Yes. I'm crazy! You all will drive me crazy for sure. Balu! He thought the call was important. He didn't know you were meditating. What happened to your leg? Did you get scared? A little. Sis... Did you notice any changes in his behaviour? He seems angry at me for something. No no. You can't imagine Balu's work stress. He does meditation to let go off that stress. I still feel he is angry at me. He was never like this. Why would he be angry at you? Come. I'll get food for you. Nah. I'm not hungry. Hello? We have reached here. Where are you? Huh? What are you saying? So you cannot come? What do you mean why?! It's for her... We had to get a gift for the bride and... You forgot?! Sweetheart... He hung up. Says he'll send Rahim. Asked us to go home. And what about the gift? Gift, my foot! Let's not stand here. Let's wait near the mosque. Not a good idea to hang around here at night. He forgot, it seems! Which world is he in! Let it go, Mom! I've been letting it go too much! And that's why these things happen. I am done with this! Where the hell is the driver?! Making two women wait here alone... - Let your father come home. - Its okay, Mom! What's okay?! What will people think? - Mom! - Kareem is too much! Can you be quiet for a bit? Didn't I tell you to wear your scarf? - Now its the scarf! - Why not! We are in public now. Oh there he is! So what about the gift? Get in. This man...! How could he do this! Rahim... Why didn't Kareem come? Mr. Kareem is terribly busy. Yeah, right! His work, his workers, his concreting! - Mom! Dad must have gotten busy. - Of course, he must have! He never thinks about his family. He let two women wait on the road alone. - Can you stay silent for sometime? - Sure, I can. Let him get home. Dear Lord! I was actually studying... just had a doubt in the middle... thought I'll Google it. Here, drink it. Okay. I'll have it. I understand what is in the head of girls of your age. These phone calls... don't take them seriously. I'd prefer 'our own' people. Your dad and me... will find a suitable boy for you. - Get married only if you like him. - Hmm. Try it out for a year... and if you don't like him... leave him. Then go, live your life as you wish. Okay? Okay. But give me your word... that you'll marry someone from our community. Okay. Drink it. And if that doesn't happen... you'll see my dead body. I don't have anyone else. Forget studies for the day. Drink your milk and sleep. Sir... Yes. No Sir... haven't collected that premium yet. The person is not in town. Will collect it within two days. Sir. Where's he? He ate? He went somewhere this morning. No clue where to. He hasn't eaten anything. Why do you take out all your stress on him? You'll stress yourself out even more. Of course, my stress will increase. I had lined up three interviews for him last month. Did he attend even one? No, right? His visa will expire in ten days. Will have to get a new one, right? All these are expenses, Lakshmi. You ask him what he wants. Ask what his plan is. Yes, I will talk to him. You don't get tensed over that. - You ate? - No. Sit. What's our plan now? I'll call you back, Sir. Let's go somewhere for a day or two? How can we? He'll be alone here. He doesn't even know how to make himself a cup of tea. Lakshmi, no one comes to Dubai as an expert in everything. He'll figure his way out. Else let him eat from outside. Balu, please. It's his birthday tomorrow. Oh, now that too. When you step out... can you get a cake? Hmm. Ismi. Why aren't you ready yet? Don't make up excuses. [Doorbell rings] Where the hell have you been? Don't we have to attend Salaam's daughter's wedding eve celebration? Don't even ask, Sulu. Been roaming since morning. So much that my spine feels broken. Haven't had a glass of water yet! Remember that guy from Thiruvalla? Roamed everywhere trying to find him and get him to pay up. - And did you get it? - In my dreams! He slipped away yesterday itself. Okay. So, can you at least now get ready? Can I eat something first? Why would you do that? We are going for a dinner anyway. What's on your eye? That's on you and the doorbell. I'll have to apply the eyeliner again from scratch. Where's Ismi? Is she ready yet? Go ask her yourself! Ismi... Sweetheart! Ismi... Yeah, Dad? Why aren't you ready yet? I'm not coming, Dad. Have a terrible headache. But it's your friend's wedding. That's okay. I already told her. Anyway, it's just the 'mehndi' function today. I'll come for the wedding tomorrow. How will we leave in peace knowing you're alone here? Mom! No one's going to eat me up alive here. I have taken medicines for the headache, Dad. Okay. You go take rest. Don't force her. We'll lock the apartment from outside. You go get ready first. You sure you'll be done with your 'face paint' by then? - Where are you off to? - Have an urgent meeting. At this hour? Have a motivation speech to give. For a few couples. This is the time that suits them. Half an hour. I'll be back soon. What's the speech on? Tips for a successful married life. How come those tips don't work out here? Get rid off your brother first. It'll all work out then. Okay? Sure! Where's my bag? Here. Thank you. Hi Babe! I'm good, I'm good. What about you? What's up? Okay. Yeah, yeah. They went for the wedding. I just told them having a severe headache. God knows. I think she believed it. - Yeah, Zubair. - Hello, Sir. Tomorrow there's concreting work at Shyam Sir's site. Get there early with the labour. - Something funny happened! - What? During the roof construction, those Bengali labourers, from Andhra... a couple of them had a fall. - Bengali labourers from Andhra? - Yeah. What are you blabbering about? The base of that roof kept for concreting tomorrow broke... and those guys fell off from the second floor. Fell from the second floor? Yeah. And two Pakistanis fell on top of them. They've been admitted to the ICU. - Pakistani? ICU? - Yeah. - In total, how many fell off? - People? Only four... but the roof collapsed completely. You guys are going to ruin my life. What happened? Just won the Dubai Duty Free lottery. Three million Dirhams! Enough? Me asking is the problem! What are you cooking up in your head? I have serious doubts about Ismi. What doubts? Jesna is her friend. Still she found an excuse to not come with us. She... - She has a headache. - Nonsense. It's all a lie. There's something amiss. Sulu, please stop making up stories for no reason. Can I tell you something? If we just keep thinking of the same thing... we'll just make a mess of it. We'll just lose our peace of mind. Nothing else. Think of something that makes you happy. Is there anything that will make me happy? Let's get Ismi married off this year. - Now, that does make me happy. - Of course. But one thing... don't bring any proposals from your family. Over my dead body! And why so? I don't want my daughter to repeat my mistake. Got it? Ah... Like father, like daughter! 'Repeat my mistake!' Once, a husband went to meet a doctor... straight away he told the doctor... 'You have to let me go off fast'... 'I've to go have breakfast with my wife'. The doctor smiled and asked him... 'Is that so important?' 'My wife has Alzheimer's', the man said. 'She doesn't even recognize me', he added. The doctor asked... 'If that's the case, then what's the hurry?' The man's response to that is quite noteworthy. 'It's just that my wife doesn't recognize me...' 'but I do recognize her.' This kind of understanding is what makes a marriage successful. A wife understanding what her husband means to her... a husband understanding what his wife means to him. But for that, you need to be mentally prepared to open up to each other. Let me ask you something. When was the last time you hugged your wife, unfeigned? Guess you don't remember. Anyway, lets make this interesting. Why don't you guys stand up once? I'll give you thirty seconds. Let's see you hugging each other. Your own spouses, please! Bro! Why are we paying him so much to hug our own wives? What on earth is this? At least I'm getting a hug for what it's worth! [Malayalam folk song] Kareem, how's the biryani? As good as Alam's Biryani back in Kozhikode! - Really? - Really. That's because it is Alam's Biryani. I flew him and his team down here yesterday. You are something else! Enjoy the meal. Go, have food. Hey! Come with me. - Let me just eat this. - Just come. I haven't had anything since morning! Will tell you inside the car. - Rahim, start the car. - It's blocked. Can't get inside. Who the hell parked like this? - You get in from the other side. - That's also blocked. Are these guys nuts to park their cars like this? Who does such nonsense? Mister! What parking is this, man? What parking? I understand Malayalam. Who parks like this? How are we supposed to get in? - I've parked in the right spot. - What right spot? Can't you see the parking line? Yes. And you've parked across that line. Wha... Leave it. But this line is... that line... Were you even looking when you parked?! See where you've parked! Sweetheart, come here. Get out of the way. Don't look there. Take out the car now, you... Make it fast. - I'll fire him today. - Whatever. - She's not picking up. - You get in the car first. I am so hungry! Sulu... tell me what is going on! Jesna eloped with someone. Salaam's daughter?! With whom? How would I know? Good Lord! Kids these days are just... Feels like my heart is going to explode. Saina collapsed right on the stage on hearing the news. She seemed so innocent. Can't believe she had such guts. How did she evade everyone and run off though? Wore a Burqa and ran away. How will anyone know? I've always been against the Burqa. Back home, I had brought this up once during our party meeting. A few Muslims didn't like it. They expelled me from the primary membership. Know that? We shouldn't have left in a hurry in such a situation. Yeah. Sure. See what your daughter does? I've been trying to contact her since then. Her phone is always busy. And now it's switched off. Why can't she call back? See. Busy again. Must be a network issue in our apartment. Yeah. Sure. You have no clue about your daughter's networking! See... Wait till I get back home. Her phone is busy again. Why can't she call us back? Sulu, calm down. We're here. Hi Sir! The wedding ended early? No, Son. Ma'am has loose motions We returned because she wants use the loo. Oh, okay. Why are you embarrassing me? But I had to tell him something. You should have said you have loose motions. He wouldn't have believed that. Hello Mr. Shyam! Yes, the concreting will definitely happen tomorrow. I've made all the arrangements. Yes. Oh, no no. Not that 3000 sq feet. That we will do next week. We have just ordered the materials for that. Let this finish first. We will do that next week. Okay, Sir. - 15? - You didn't press the button? Why didn't you? Is there a rule that only I should do it? You got in and stood next to it. Now its going to go down again! Sulu... what were you saying the bride did? Just give me the keys! Kareem! Don't see you at the gym these days? I think I have too many muscles already. - Will come when I lose some. - Ah, okay. Ismi. Don't wake her up if she's sleeping. Ismi. God! Ismi... Ismi... Ismi... You've been hiding here all this while. Hey you! Oh God. She was right here? Get in now! Come here. What's wrong with you, Mom? Are you deaf? I've been screaming out forever. I've been here, listening to music. Couldn't you just call my phone? Sure. As if you pick up my calls. I've been calling you all the way from that wedding venue. Your number was busy. Busy! Busy! Why can't you just call back? I did. Can't help it if your phone is off. Oh God. Look how she is lying with a straight face. You liar! My phone was switched off it seems. - Dad! What's all this? - Sulu! Please keep it low. Why tell our neighbours as well? Mom, give my phone back. - You don't need a phone from now. - Please, Mom. - Give me the phone. - First, tell me the truth. Who have you been talking to? Who? I haven't been talking to anyone. Then why was your number busy all this while? Tell me, why was it busy? What's all this, Mom? Let me see what's in it. What's this? Why have you locked it? She's definitely hiding something. Now tell me the truth. Who was calling you? I'll smash this into pieces if you don't tell me the truth. Just unlock it for her. Let her be happy. What's this, Dad? I'm not a little kid. What about my privacy? Your what? What do you want? Privacy! See. Now who's this? Who's this? Sulu, that's from the Customer Care. Don't pick it up. At this hour at night? Customer care? You know nothing. It's those Customer Care folks. They cut the call. See, it's ringing again. Let me see what 'Customer Care' want. Hello. They cut the call. From when did these guys start hanging up? Now who's this? Vicks? Is this the medicine for your headache? That's my friend. Friend? Let me see. Ismi... Is your Mom, 'Mrs. Doubt-fire' back home? Say that to your own mother! Of course, he cut the call. Do you see now how your adorable daughter operates? Is this what you tell your friends about me? You told your friends that she was a 'Mrs. Doubt-fire'? All such things should stay within the family. - What? - Oh, okay you can tell people. Let me call him back. Goodness! What's with this lock? Have you hidden some treasure inside? Unlock it now! What! Wait... Wait till I get hold of you... Open the door! Ismi! She shut the door from inside. - She's not opening it. - Sulu! Why are you getting paranoid over this? She's a kid. It's their age. Let it go. Yeah, she's a kid! Why don't you sing her a lullaby then?! She is a grown up girl. If she does something stupid... you better find a place to hide yourself... and that bald head. - Hello, Sir! - Yeah, go on... Started again. Did we ever imagine that... Salaam's daughter would do this? - No. - Exactly. Only a girl and God knows what goes on inside her head. I'm telling you all this so that you don't end up like Salaam. - Got it? - Yes. Don't think things at Salaam's house would be as bad as this! I'm so hungry! Hello. Listen, don't call me for a while. Don't ask. I somehow managed to wriggle out of it. Mom made a big issue out of it. I snatched the phone and ran in. Dad is also here. Call me only when I message you. Okay? Done. God! Did you mix curd in the Sambaar? Who does that? Then why does it taste sour? Any dish will turn sour if kept inside the fridge for a month. You please listen to me. It's not as simple as you think. These phone calls have been going on for a while. She just whispers on it all the time. And cuts the call whenever I'm passing by. But who's calling her so much? That same guy, Vicks. The one who called you Mrs. Doubt-fire? Yeah, that devil. And his real name is not Vicks or anything. - Vivek. That's his name. - Really? He stays in the C Block. Apartment 1001. Good Lord! How did you get all this info? A normal human should have some level of intelligence... or common sense... or at least care a little about their family. You don't have any of these. Concrete. Concrete. Concrete. Tomorrow we are laying the concrete at Shyam Sir's house. You better shut up and listen to me. Tell me. What should I do? We should go to their place and figure what this is about. Let's inform the guy's parents. - Can I finish this first? - Finish it fast. Then we'll go. Seriously? In the middle of the night? They must be sleeping. Wait till the morning. We'll go then. You just get some good sleep. You go sleep! I won't be able to sleep in peace. We have to fix this first thing tomorrow morning. I have to go to the site tomorrow morning. No work happens if I'm not around. And Shyam Sir will kill me if I don't turn up. I will kill you if you don't come with me. Decide... who do you want to get killed by. God, you know she's my only daughter! Please guide her to the right path. My head's bursting. Sulu... - Sulu. - What? Can I get some more rice? There's nothing left! Rice. Concrete. Rice. Concrete. I've never seen anyone like you. Is the sweet ready? Ready to be served! - Can I taste it? - Yeah. It's hot. - Super! - Really? - Sweet enough? - Yeah. What are you worried about? I'm worried about you. What did I do now? Remember, we aren't going there with a marriage proposal. - So? - We don't know what his dad is like. Or how they would react to this. Don't try to boss them around, the way you do with me. Just be at your best behaviour. I'm not even going to talk. You take the lead. - Sure? - Yeah. Thank God! Hope you won't show your true colours on getting there! Can't get through to his number even on his birthday! Does he know it's his birthday? Who knows? I don't get him at all. You look pretty. What? You... look really beautiful in this. Burn all those nighties of yours. Wear these everyday. Really? Then why don't you do this Balu... Buy me a hundred like these. I can wear a new one everyday. No? Not now... the sweet... Balu... [Doorbell rings] Don't shout at him. It's his birthday. What an ideal brother! Yes? Guess we got the address wrong... come let's go. Why did you tell him we got the address wrong? We came to the right place. Didn't you recognise him? Why wouldn't I? I'm not blind. What are you afraid of? - I'll talk to them. - That's what I'm afraid of! - Come with me or I'm going alone. - Sulu! Just come. [Doorbell rings] Yes? Anything wrong? No... That thing yesterday... at the parking lot. We just came to apologize. And what's wrong in meeting and getting to know people anyway. We live in Block A. You come in. Apartment Number 715 in A Block. - Please sit down. - Uh? - Please sit down. - Ah. - Didn't get your name. - Yeah, didn't get your name. What's your name? No... I was asking your... Oh, my name? Abdul Kareem. - This is my wife. - Sulfi. - What do you do? - I... work as a contractor. Not a big one at that. Just a few small constructions... with the Bengali labourers. Big or small, a contractor is always high up the ladder. I'm Balakrishnan. I'm an insurance agent. Also a motivational speaker... just a side gig. This is my wife, Lakshmi. - Let me get some tea for you. - Please. No. We just dropped in on our way somewhere. - We'll leave now. - But... You're coming for the first time. We just had tea. And I've to get to work fast. There's some concreting work going on there. The cement hasn't been delivered. And there's shortage of steel bars. You know how these Bengali labourers are. Need constant overseeing. - Hello? - Listen Shyam Sir... I'll call you back. - Should I call you back... - I'll call you back. Uh... you wanted to hang out, right? Seems like we are 'hung'... What? I mean... we have hung out now. We'll definitely hang out more. We'll have tea then. Let's go. We'll leave now. Kareem! - Is there any problem? - Not at all. Come with me. - What were we here for? - Are you mad, Sulu? I'm not, you are. You froze like a deer in a headlight! I didn't freeze. You saw them right. Think they have a son old enough to pester our daughter? Do I look like someone who has a daughter old enough for wedlock? You look like someone who would've had a daughter before wedlock. I think you got the wrong guy. I am sure I got the right guy. Why are you so hesitant in telling them? I'm not hesitant. We can't just barge in on a weekend and say stuff. How indecent! Don't teach me decency. I know all about it. Sulu, they look like decent people... Of course they are. It's their son who's the problem. Kareem Bhai! How are you? We are... - What are you doing here? - This... They came to meet me. Oh. Okay. The lift is under repair. It'll take at least half an hour. What did he say? The lift isn't working. Let's take the steps. No way! I'm too tired for that. Can't climb all the way down. Let's wait inside till it's fixed. Is that okay? Sure... Come, let's have tea. - Forget tea and all. - No. We'll have tea. I have a terrible headache. See. It's all God's plan. He damaged the lift. Yeah, right... because God is a Mitsubishi employee. - You'll tell them, right? - Yes, but you keep quiet. The lift is always under repair in our block too. Really? It's frequent here as well. Lakshmi... It's Vivek's birthday today. So I made some dessert. We didn't come here to taste your pudding. Your kid is a nuisance. Didn't get you... Your Vivek... he is quite the troublemaker. Are you sure you're talking about our Vivek? Yes, him. He's been troubling my daughter. Vivek is troubling your daughter? I don't believe it. I have proof. His incessant calls! Listen. You can't just walk in and talk nonsense. You've come early in the day to say this?! Lakshmi... Cool. Could you tell me your daughter's name? Ismi. - Ismi. - It's Ismi. Ah, Ismi. So your daughter Ismi told you that our Vivek... has been troubling your Ismi with calls. Is that why you came here? Didn't get it? Let me elaborate. Did you come here because your Ismi told you that our Vivek has been 'troubling her', your daughter, by making incessant calls? Or did you come here because 'you' felt that our Vivek has been troubling your daughter by making incessant calls? Is my question clear now? Why would she have to tell us that? That doesn't make sense. We also need to know the truth. You've been complaining about Vivek right? Yes. Cool cool. It is obvious that you guys came to talk about some serious matter. Suppose what you're saying is true... - It is true. - If so... So is your issue with our Vivek calling... your daughter and troubling her... or is it because... you think they are in love? Balu! Vivek is not having an affair with anyone. I'm sure. You're sure right? Even my daughter is not in love with any moron! Listen, let's all calm down. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. That's right. I know it just too well. Mr. Kareem, what is your take on all this? According to me... this guy... - Vivek. - Yeah, Vivek. It's some confusion regarding Vivek trying to call Ismi. Nothing big. What the hell?! - It's just that, right? - Is that how you say it? - Now, listen to me carefully. - Okay. If the phone calls are a nuisance... there's a medicine for that. But if they are in love, there's no medicine for that. Even if there is, you give that medicine to your son! We didn't come here with a marriage proposal. There is no guy here for your proposal as well. Lakshmi. Cool, cool. My next question is extremely relevant. For how long has Vivek been calling your daughter? Any idea? This nuisance has been going on for a long time. Fair enough. In that case... has your daughter been responding to those calls? - No. - Yes. - No? - We don't know. How's that even an answer?! You were saying you have proof. When you're accusing someone, especially with such things, you should have solid proof and credible information. - Am I right Mr. Kareem? - Absolutely. Whose side are you on? - But he does make sense. - Nonsense. Balu, can you come in for a minute? Just come! - What did we come here for? - Let me explain. There they go! Why are you supporting them? - I wasn't supporting. - Then? But doesn't our daughter talk to that guy? Did we come here to tell them that? Are you taking one of your motivation classes there? That lady is crazy. How dare she come to our house and talk like that? That too about Vivek. It's his birthday. I'm not going to stand this any more. Keep your voice down! Balu, I am losing it! Go, get rid of them. They came to our home throwing accusations. Shouldn't we find out what the truth is? You really think Vivek would do something like this? Do you? - No. - Then? Don't stress me out more, please! You go and figure out a way to get rid of them. Relax. We'll figure it out. Come. I'm not a part of this. Sulu, have you gone mad? I had warned you before coming here. You can't walk in to a stranger's house and blabber nonsense. Learn some manners from me. And act as if I swallowed my own tongue? Did someone gag you? I had to speak because you refused to. Ismi is your daughter as well right? - Any doubts on that? - Yeah. - What? - No. That's not what I meant. Why are we scared of them? Who me? I'm not scared. You're the only one in the world I'm scared of. Good for you. I didn't get a word of what he said. - Neither did I. - What? Then why were you nodding for everything? So that they don't understand that we did not understand! - He and his... - Stop. Listen... Are you sure it's Vivek who has been calling and troubling your daughter? Have you met Vivek before? Is there anyone who doesn't know Vivek? This has gone on for too long now. You mistook him for someone else. Not at all. I'll show you the proof now. [Doorbell rings] Excuse me. Who is this now! - What is it? - The lift is working now, Sir. Ah, thank you. [Doorbell rings] - Now what? - Forgot to say something. The water supply will shut from eight till nine. Okay. Go now. Didn't find the photo yet? Calm down. I'll show it to you. That's why we've come anyway. There! Isn't this your beloved Vivek? Is this your proof? Balu, they've taken it from his Facebook. This is just a photo. Wait till I show you the video. There is a video?! Hello Sir! Kareem here. Bloody idiot! You took all my money, broke the roof and now how will you finish the concreting? Sir, it will be done today. I've sent around twenty labourers there. And have arranged for all the materials. And on whose head will you build the roof? - Those labourers are useless. - Show the video. Sir, just show the video. Hell... He cut the call. You guys carry on. I'll be back in no time. You'll leave me alone here? How's that fair? Let's sort this out first. Why don't you take a seat? I had some urgent things at work. Show me the video. - Yeah, I will. - Yeah, do it. Hello. I think... I think it got deleted. These guys are definitely trying to trick us. First you told there's a photo. Then a video. And now it got deleted apparently. They think they can fool us. But I did show you the photo. Listen... all this trickery will work in Kerala. This is Dubai. You'll get into trouble. [Doorbell rings] Zubair... Whose mother's grave are you digging now? Shyam Sir called me and cursed the devil out of me. Didn't I tell you there is concreting today? Listen, I had an accident on my way to work... I'll call you back. You crashed the car?! - Yes? - We're Vivek's friends. - He isn't here. - He is on the line. Uh... Hello? Hey! They are my friends. There is a small issue. They have eloped. Could they stay with us just for a day? Eloped?! Oh, there is nothing to worry. They have registered their marriage at the court in Kerala. Listen Vivek... where are you now? Just come here first. There has already been an issue because of you. Don't cause any more, please! Get that? Isn't that Salaam's daughter? What do you care who that is! Listen... no one can stay with us. I'll give them the phone. You explain things to them. Sorry. - What did he say? - He said he'll come. - Let me inform Salaam. - What for?! His daughter is here. Think of what he is going through. - We too have a daughter. - Exactly! Think about her for now. She eloped and that won't change. We are here to make sure your daughter doesn't. Just sit! Don't do it! What is this, Balu? There's two crosses to bear seated in our living room. Three others came and left. Your brother has gone bonkers. Does he have an endless supply of plans that cause trouble?! Does he? I just don't get it. Why must I ruin my weekend for your brother? But in any case... why are they here? And that lady has been telling lies after lies! Enough, Balu! Get rid of these nutcases and do whatever after that. Come. - Wasn't that Salaam's daughter? - Doesn't matter. They've left. - This is a cybercrime. - Ah. - Wait... Cybercrime?! - What? - You were talking about a video? - What video? The one you said got deleted. Who shot that? You? - No! I am not crazy to do that. - Then, who shot it? - I don't know. - Where did you get that video from? Call your son. Ask him. Stop fooling around. You can talk to us. But she does have a point. Call the boy. We can ask him directly. We can solve this peacefully. His phone is off. Let's discuss this between us first. Where did you get the video from? Sulu... my love, just tell them where you got it from. Time's being wasted. We need to get back home. Is your daughter in the video? No! Definitely not! Then why won't you tell us where you got the video from? Balu, I think her daughter is the troublemaker. No, she is not! I have raised her well! Listen... today is a special occasion for us. I have been speaking to you with all due respect. I already told you this seems like a cybercrime. What is the big deal in telling us where you got the video from? - The problem is... - Sulu, my dear... - Zubair... - Hang up right now! You hang up right now! Oh I mean... Zubair... Did you go to Mr. Shyam's site? Oh yes, I am here. The concreting work has begun. - Praise be to the Lord! - He was really upset. - Did he say anything about me? - Oh, nothing at all. But there was something about your mother being a... Jeez. What has she got to do with this! Okay, go on now. Listen... most of the cyber department officers are my clients. I just need to make one phone call. And then you'll be blurting out answers to their questions. You don't want that kind of trouble. Sulu, my love... didn't you hear him? Just tell them who sent you the video. That will solve the matter. I cannot say that. This has gone on for too long! Stop testing my patience. No need to threaten us. You don't know your son. What are you even saying... Son? Firstly, he is not our son. He is my brother. - Brother? - Yes! We don't have children. That explains it! They don't have children. Only those who have children will know what this despair feels like. It's more like... we don't have children... yet. Mr. Balu... You senseless woman! You think you can say whatever you want? What did I say? Why can't you understand the despair of couples who don't have children? How dare she say that Balu? Don't you have anything to say? Her saying that means nothing. Only we know what we are going through. Today's a good day. Forget it. Cheer up. Just get them to leave. I will do just that. But not before we clarify the nonsense they have been saying about our family. You relax. Don't worry about it. It's been a while. Shall we go? - Go where? - Home. - Go home? - Yes You created this mess. We can't just go without solving it. - What mess did I create? - Oh, so I created this issue? You claimed you had a video and started this whole issue. And then you blabbered insensitive nonsense and made that girl cry. Here's what you can do. Either, you say it was a mistake and apologize Or at least tell me who sent you that video. - That I cannot. - Why not? I swore by the Lord that I won't tell anyone. Oh... then don't. Ismi and I will visit you at the jail. Eh? At the jail? Didn't you hear him? He is quite influential with the cybercrime guys. One phone call and the cops will be here. The two of you will leave only after you tell us about the video. Hey hey! No need to be melodramatic. Either you show me the video. Or you tell us where you got it from. Until then you both can stay here. What's the point of sitting here and crying? Go talk to that girl. Tell her that we have a daughter and you said those things out of your worry for her. Tell her you are sorry and not to inform the police. Go apologize. Go, quick. I'll call you later! I wasn't trying to hurt you. I said it out of my fears. I only have one child. We were living in Kerala. She was studying there. One of her classmates was in a relationship with a boy. When they got into a fight... ...he slit her throat with a blade! We were worried sick for her. That's why we brought Ismi here. And now here... these phone calls... they have me scared to the bone. That's why I blurted that out. I am sorry. Mr. Balu, I am sorry. She wasn't trying to hurt you both. She is a typical countryside person. She isn't very educated and blurts out everything on her mind. She has been here only for six months. Quite the halfwit she is! You saw what happened now... She started crying when you raised your voice. And now she has gone to beg your wife's forgiveness. Her senselessness... I can understand. Why would you let her convince you to get into these situations? It's not like that, Sir. She didn't allow me to sleep a wink last night. She had seen a call from Vivek on Ismi's phone. She got upset and was in panic mode all night. Why don't you take her to a doctor then?! We have only one child. A girl. We are worried she'd get into something that's not right for her. And as if to add fuel to the fire... my friend's daughter eloped with her lover last night. On her wedding eve that too! This anxiety begin since we got to know this news. In fact, it's the girl who eloped... who came here a while ago. Salaam's daughter. Oh, okay. Do you think... Vivek and your daughter are in a relationship? Oh dear Sir, no! Her suspicions are baseless. I asked my daughter too. She said "There's nothing, Dad". This is not as serious as we are making it out to be. Brandy, right? - No, it's whiskey. - Oh, whiskey is the best. Isn't it 'forbidden' for you? Under such special circumstances, I generally don't worry about it. Pour me another, please! [Doorbell rings] You called the cybercrime guys? No, I didn't. Let me check who it is. - Mr. Balu... right? - Yes. Pankajakshan... the politician from Kerala he asked me to meet you. He spoke to you about a donation for charity. - Oh, yes. - I am here to collect that. - Okay. - Yeah. - Your name? - Hydrose Thunjanparambil. Oh, yes. He had told me. I knew you'd be here on a Friday. Come, let's sit inside and talk. - Who it it? - Who is it! Huh! Who are you? - A friend of mine. - Oh, what's your name? Kareem. Ah, you're having a weekend party! Nice. Carry on. Who is that? A visitor from my home-town. When people from different communities marry... it generally never works out. And Kareem doesn't understand that. He is an old-time communist. By the way... I generally see women wearing this only for festivals. Do you wear it everyday? - Oh you mean the Kerala Saree? - Yes. No no. Today is Vivek's birthday. We went to the temple. So I wore it. Oh, okay. So what is this for? A small charity that comes to about 10 to 15 million rupees. Oh, what is the case? Oh we are getting this poor kid new knees. - New niece? - No... a knee replacement surgery! - For 1.5 crore rupees? - Yes, 1.5 crores! Are you putting in a gold knee? We need to account for the accompanying expenses you know...'other expenses'? That's where the bulk of the money goes. Get it? If you have any doubts, - you have two knees, right? - Yes. Try replacing one. You'll know what it takes. - What's the name of the kid? - What kid? - Whose knees are being replaced? - Oh, not in his name! In my name, please. The money for the knees goes through my account. Hydrose Thunjanparambil. Hydrose Thunjan... parambil. T-H as in "Thuthukudi." Yep, that's right. Hey! Why did you bring all this here? I thought... let's not drink in the kitchen. If Sulu catches me... I'll be thrown out of the house. Clear the table. Keep it over there. I feel like I know... But I am not sure who exactly he is! - You didn't recognize me? - No. We met near kitchen? You got scared... - Yeah... - Haleem, right? - Who? - I mean... Kareem right? - That's me... - Yes! - Who are you? - I am Hydrose Thunjanparambil. Haven't you heard of my YouTube channel? I go live on it often. Oh I get it! You collect funds... in the name of... helping people. - "The tree of life"? - Yeah. Well, people call me several things. But I don't let it go to my head. The people know who I really am. And I know that the people know who I really am. So there is nothing to worry about. Oh, just a moment. Hello? Yes, that's right. Okay... so an eye surgery. Right... And how old is this girl who needs new eyes? What!? 97 years old?! So she is... your grandmother? Can your grandmother cry well? So then just get a good video of her crying and Whatsapp it to me. The money will reach you through my account. Don't worry. It'll get to you without any issues. Yes, okay. Alright then! So I need to get going. I have a video shoot today. - Will this even get there? - Of course, it will! And rest assured, I will be coming again. - Kareem... - Yes? - See you around! - Oh, please no! The things people do to survive! And people like you donate to these chaps too! That politician was after my blood. Mr. Balu... I hope you've no grudge against me for the incident at the car parking. Oh, I never thought about it afterwards. I guess it was your stress that made you react that way. 10 years is nothing! My uncle did not have kids for 18 years! And when he did have... he had quadruplets! Oh wow, so they have four kids now? No! Twelve. - One every year after that. - Wow. When the Lord decides to bless you, it will always be in abundance. Don't worry. - Which doctor are you meeting? - Here in... Phone. Where have you been? Come home soon. We'll order food only after you get here. Okay. - That was Vivek. - What? Vivek called. By the way, have you taken insurance for your construction workers? - God, no! - What... why not?! Half your stress will go as soon as you get insurance. Is it expensive? Not at all. I'll setup something on a small premium for you. - That'll be great. - Sure, will be! - Balu! - Oh no! She was looking for me. I'll be back. He can't do without Mutton Biryani on Fridays. I cook it in the morning itself. You haven't cooked for the day yet? - What happened? - Nothing, just... Where were you? I was with Balu... discussing insurance schemes. - Don't you have to go? - Yes, let's leave. - Vivek will be back soon. - He called? Yes. Said will be back soon. Since you are here already, meet him and go. Yeah. Let me make some tea. Come, Sulu. The fool did not catch me! How many of your employees... have a work permit? Let's work on a policy for them first. Sulu must not know. - About the insurance? - No! That I had a couple of drinks. Oh that she won't come to know! In any case... on Fridays under special circumstances... isn't it allowed? The only thing allowed for us on Fridays is the Friday prayer. Get it? So then don't drink. When the Lord presents us with the opportunity... and we don't take it, do you think he'd forgive us? This... the Lord understands. That devil won't! She is going to kill me today! Vivek always wants tea when he gets home. Oh, interesting. - You both have sugar, right? - Oh, a lot! Kareeem puts 4 teaspoons of sugar in a cup of tea. Four?! At that rate you'd have to buy sugar in sacks! Yes, that's how we do it! - Really? - Yeah! [Doorbell rings] I'll watch it. - Oh God! - Boss, you're back! - What happened? - Where were you? It's my birthday today. I went out with my friends. My phone ran out of battery. You've no idea about the mess you've created. - What happened? - I'll tell you. This is the Vivek you've come looking for. Hi Aunty! - Hey... - Yes? Do you know her daughter Ismi? Yes, I do. - How do you know her? - We're friends. How do you know each other? Ismi is my best friend. Okay, and how did that happen? We studied together. Where? Thrissur Engineering College. Ah! - Is there a problem? - No, no. - I can call her. - No, don't! She called me today morning too. That's why... - Happy now? - Uh, yeah. Sis, can you get me my passport? Why? I urgently need to make a couple of copies. - Keep an eye on the tea, please? - Yes, of course. Oh, and... - the power bank too, please. - Okay. - You have insurance, right? - Yes. Oh, then your wife and daughter are safe. We live for our family, don't we? You need to sit back and enjoy life! - We should enjoy, right? - Yes, we should. Then how about another drink? That's creative. - So we'll do this after that? - Yes. Let me get it. Son, do you call Ismi often? I do. Well, don't. She is preparing for her exams. She needs to study, right? So, don't call her. - Aunty, come on! - What? Ah... we just met. When did you come? Just now. - A word...? - What is it? - What really is your plan? - What do you mean? Thanks to you, I have no peace in life! What happened? You think only you have friends? You're always out with friends. You help them elope. You expect us to accommodate them. What the hell man? Listen Bro... this is not Kerala. This is Dubai. I haven't been lucky enough to see the jails here. Don't try to inflict that good fortune upon me! Why did you come here? - To find a job. - Ah, you remember! So first take care of yourself. Then look into other people's matters. Listen... In ten days, your visa will expire. If you love your sister even a bit... please go back home! Okay? Okay, go now. Sulu, I swear by God, I was praying! Why are you here? Brother, our hero is here. - Who? - Vivek. - Ah! - Shall I get him here? - Why? - You should talk to him. What can I say to him? Brother... Well... it is because of him that we happened to meet and get to know each other. - Yeah... - So you should talk to him. What do we even tell these kids? Here you go. - Don't you want this? - Oh, yes. - Don't you want tea? - No. - Get back soon, please. - I will! Hmm. I really... cannot... stand any kind of misunderstanding. I need to put my mind at ease. Also, he is a bit of a brat. It will be good if you have a go at him and advise him. Then get him here. I will advise him! - Will you fall asleep? - No! Such a nice man! Can you pass me that tray? Hey... where is Vivek? He left. - He went out? - Yeah. When? A while back. Drat! Why? Nothing. Hello... where is the boy? What a crazy kid! He stepped out again. Stepped on whom? I mean he went out. Should be back soon. So... I was happily taking a nap. And you woke me up... asking me to advice your brother-in-law and left. You return and say that he left! Are you mocking me? - Brother... - Don't you 'Brother' me! I am not going to fall for your sweet talk! Go get your brother-in-law! Please don't yell... And what will happen if I do? They will hear us. Let them hear! I don't give a darn! Call your brother-in-law! Why are you getting angry? What else do you expect me to get when my ass is on fire! Brother, please calm down. Nothing big enough has happened for you to lose your cool. Well, not yet. But if nothing else must happen... just bring your brother-in-law here. Yes, yes. He'll be back. Just wait for a bit. Oh yeah? I should wait for him?! Is there no value for my time?! Call him on the phone. His phone is off. Fine, bring his phone. I'll switch it on for him. Don't try to hide him and play these tricks on me, Balu! - You're drunk. - What? - You are drunk! - I am drunk, huh? Wow! So I am... drunk. And you are fine! So what did you drink then? Some scented tea?! You invite decent people over, give them alcohol and insult them? I was joking... You think you can joke around with me? Do you know who I am? You think you know Abdul Kareem, the son of Parakaattil Abdul Rahman Haji? - Do you? - No. If what Sulu was saying turns out to be true... If he has called my daughter even once on the phone, one phone call is what it will take. The best of our men will be flown in from Kozhikode on a chartered flight. They will chop your brother-in-law like a 'Shawarma'. They will crush his body on the floor and... Do you know what a Kuboos is? Yes, I have it everyday. So they will put him in a Kuboos and shove him down your throat. Shut your mouth! What are you doing... a breathing exercise?! - What did you say? - I said nothing. No, earlier. Every action... what? Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. And who is reacting now?! Open your mouth and speak! - It is paining! - Pain? What are you in... labour?! Zubair... Call me later! - It's my phone. - Oh, who's calling? - Boss... - Whose Boss? Right now... I am your boss! Cut the call! - Are we done? - No! You made my Sulu cry. We have been married for 22 years. I have never said a word that hurt her feelings or brought a tear to her eye. You know?! A decent gentleman would never make a woman cry. Especially... a non-resident Indian. How about you deal with the man here? Come on! You're barely a match for me! What did you say? You'll call the cybercrime guys, huh! There isn't one cybercrime officer in Dubai who I don't know personally. Sit down! You want to draft insurance policies for my guys who have a work permit! - No. - Go ahead... make one now! I can't find my pen... No point having a pen, if you don't know how to write! You know why you don't have kids? To have kids, you need to have a good... that thing... - ...heart! A good heart! - Stop saying rubbish! What will you do if I don't? Shave my... Good Lord! My dear good God! What is this? My love... are you hurt? - Of course not! - Why is he slurring? - Balu, what happened? - I did nothing. He got drunk, stumbled and fell onto the table! You were drinking?! As such, he is an absent-minded man with bare minimum senses working. There is no stopping him when drunk. He broke one at our home last week. Why did you give him alcohol?! I didn't even offer it to him. He walked in and helped himself! You don't know the performance he just put up here! Because this is my home and he is here with you I am keeping my cool. I too drink. What kind of behaviour is this?! Get him and get out! Get up. I said... get up! - Walk! - Hey! Come over to my place sometime! - Sorry. - Okay. Keep walking! You walk! Should I hold you? Darn this. What have they done?! You can blame your darling brother for this! Clean it. What's taking so long. Walk! Wait wait. I forgot my spectacles. Your darned spectacles! And my mobile? Will a poke in your face wake you up?! Gulped down alcohol that wasn't even offered got sloshed and created a scene. How embarrassing, Lord! Do you know what you did in a stranger's house? It was my good fortune that you didn't get slapped. All of this happened just because of you. I begged you to not come here. If we had stayed at home, none of this would have happened. But why would we, right?! Firstly, you need to learn to listen to your man. Let's get home. I'll show you how that's done. Today you are finished! Good God! Tomorrow there's concreting at our site. Get in! What nuisance! Hey! Not like that. You'll get cut. Fine! What a mess! I'll do it, Love. Step back. Wonder what set off the day's fortunes! Come! - Aren't we going to our flat? - No, we aren't. Hey Ismi! Stop it. Come here! Give me the keys. Always creating trouble! Come in. Get inside. - Ismi? - Ismi? Ismi? Where is she? Ismi! Never responds... this girl! Ismi! Hey... Ismi! What are you doing there? Come here. - Dad! - Come inside! - Yes, Dad? - Who is this? - A friend. - A friend?! Sulu... Step aside. - Uncle... - Come here! Uncle? Whose uncle? Unc... - That's him! - Him? Vivek! - You! - Hey... Let me explain! - Uncle... - Shut up! It's not what you think it is. Hey! Can you now see her for what she is? When we were not here... She... Good Lord! Listen to me... please! You are misunderstanding the situation. It's not like that! - Please Uncle... I did not... - Go inside! I did not do anything! Don't shut the door, please. Open the door, Uncle! Open the door, please! Ismi... tell them! - Mom! Can you hear me out? - No need for that! I am going to kill you today. You've spoilt her like a brat! Yes! Don't talk. Don't even try your tricks! - Who is it? - Unknown number. Hello? Are you sure it's Vivek? No need to call the police. We are coming right away. What happened? Your darling brother is... locked up in that Kareem's house. - What for? - God knows. What the hell is he up to? We'll come back and clean up. Let's go. What's the point of crying after creating this mess? - Mom... I... - Let me out, please! What did I even do to be locked up like this? Uncle, I have not done anything. Open the door! Ismi, ask him to open the door. Uncle, this is too much! Shut up! Your family has been informed. Let them come. - Mom... Mom, let me explain... - You want to spoil our name?! You want to bring us disrepute?! [Doorbell rings] Once they leave, you'll get the rest of your share! Don't you dare speak, when they talk! Where is he? Come on in. Now do you admit your brother is no saint? When I said it, you didn't want to hear a word of it! He sneaks in here, when she's alone! You were making big statements earlier! See what he has done now. What do we do now? Call the cops? Ask him to open the door. And tell me what have I even done?! Let him out first. Let him out and bring him here. We can ask him directly what's all this about. Discuss what?! What he did is forbidden and unforgivable! He waited for us to leave and snuck in when she was alone. He saw us in your apartment. He saw an opportunity and snuck in here. Don't you dare speak! Why did you come in here when she was alone? I came here to celebrate my birthday. Ismi is my friend. What friend? Why are you celebrating your birthday here? Can you give me a moment? Let me ask the questions. Why did you come here? Why are you all talking like this? What is the problem here? - Have you come here before? - Yes, I have. Goodness gracious! People must have seen it. So your problem is that two friends met to cut a birthday cake? We met and cut a cake for Ismi's birthday too! Dear Lord! Forgive us! What more must I hear! How long has this been going on? There you go! This is your problem. Can a man and woman only have one kind of relationship? Which era are you living in? Dad, he is telling the truth. We're just good friends. Shut up. I've heard this friends nonsense for too long now. Don't you have any female friends? Why aren't you saying anything? What do we do next? What is there to be done? Call the cops! Please... [Doorbell rings] Who is that? Huh? Hi Uncle! Is Ismi home? - Uh... yeah, but... - Come Hi! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Excuse me, kid. One moment. Aren't you Salaam's daughter? Yes. Let me call Salaam. Salaam... your daughter is here at my place. I don't want to hear anything about her. She's dead to me since yesterday. Anything else? Salaam! What are you saying?! Who did you elope with, kid? With me. Vivek! What the hell?! It's true. I asked her to elope with me. Praise be to God! So, is this why you took a visiting visa and came here? Please don't blame him. My father arranged my wedding in a hurry and left us with no choice. I was planning on telling you both myself as soon as I got a job. But things... just went haywire. Are you happy now? You made a such a big fuss just for this. You misunderstood my baby for no reason at all! Forget about it! [Doorbell rings] Now who is it? - Peace be upon you! - Peace be upon you too! Who is this guy?! Hello! Hey! Happy Birthday Bro! Hey! Hey! Hi! Hello. What is going on? - Hi... Hi! - Hi. - Hi! Hello! - Holla... - Aunty... - Hmm? - This is Omar Bin Abdul Aziz... - Yes, I am Omar. - He is a friend of ours. - Hmm. - He is an excellent footballer. - So? Aunty... The guy you've been looking for... the "Customer Care" guy... That's him! He and Ismi have been in a relationship for a while now. Is that true?! Yes, Mom. I am in love with Omar. Omar is my man! Omar is your man?! Good God! - Oh Lord... - Mom! Hey hey! Nobody move. Don't touch her. Let her stay there silent for a bit. [Malayalam folk song] - Hello! How are you? All good? - Hmm. Why are you sitting alone away from the proceedings? I am here. What else can I do? I don't want people to think that I am in favour of this. What? A lot of people live like you. You are born, you wonder what people will think... and then you die. Must you spend your entire life wondering what people will think? I mean... I am just saying. It is your life and your decision to make.
