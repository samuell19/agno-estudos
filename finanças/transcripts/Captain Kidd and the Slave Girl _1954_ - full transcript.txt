A visitor. Your excellency, we have a guest, someone, I trust, of whom you approve. My Lord Bellomont honors me by this visit. Our four-footed friend with a long tail seems to think otherwise. At that, his judgment is probably better than mine, since your visit is strangely late. Aye, the air does seem to have taken a sudden change for the worse. Would you hold me responsible for the sudden failure of a business deal? This is my neck. Tomorrow, the hangman means to make it his. We took every possible step in your defense. Except coming into court and telling the truth. I was no pirate. I had an official commission from you to seize the freebooters, granted by your authority as chairman of the colony council, and I attacked no ship except those flying the black flag. Now, you could have said all that in a matter of six seconds. You refuse to understand. The whole government would have become involved in a major scandal. So, it was much simpler to snatch away and conceal my commission and hustle me off to the gallows, because you were afraid to have it known you and Captain Avery the pirate were hand in hand from the very beginning. I may now assure you that a full pardon is within your grasp. And the price, I presume, is high. All you need now do is... Is supply a map showing where I hid the treasure I took off Captain Avery's pirate ship, the Quedagh Merchant. You anticipate me, Captain. Astutely. I have brought this chart of the Indies seas. Now, we know the treasure lies somewhere here. If you will just mark the spot... You do have the final laugh, Captain: the treasure. But what good will it do you if you hang? The flame burns fast, Captain, the few hours fly. So speak. Where is the treasure? Life for a few words. For silence, death. I've never counted life so dear as to hesitate at venturing death. I trusted you once, but never again. Good night, my lord, I must rest. My public expects me to look my best tomorrow. Get in. The carriage, you say? Where else, you gaping oaf? Inside. Well! Am I to ride to my ship for transportation to the colonies in such elegance? It fair leaves me speechless, sir. Where you ride, my good man, depends upon yourself. Get in. And the choice is yours. What is your answer? Well, milord, I've ever been known as a practical man, and if it's a choice between transportation to the colonies in the hold of a convict ship, or being giving me freedom... With suitable payment in gold. Then, milord, I'll say, "What are your orders?" and, "Where is your money?" Grog. Compliments of the King. I am indebted to His Majesty for this remembrance. Customary. Anyone condemned to the gallows has the privilege of one last drink. Helps keep up their courage. Also quenches a man's thirst. Compliments of Captain Kidd. Speech! Give us a speech, Captain! Speech. Speech you want. No speech. Ever been the privilege of the condemned to say a final word, Jamie. I got my orders. Would you stand between a dying man and his maker? Unburden yourself, my son, and have faith. It can work miracles. Miracles? It's too late for miracles. Find it hard to make your peace? Then it's I who will pray for you. Must be done while I finish my business. Would you be havin' a light for a friend? I have no time for lights. I have to deliver a package. And might that package be for a rough, sea-farin' sort of fellow? It might. Aye, and glad I am to be rid of it. In there. Took you long enough. It's no easy job stealing a body off the gallows. I had to wait. I see no sign of life. The heart gives it. Saints be praised! It beats! Yet why does he not stir? 'Twas a powerful dose of drug put in his pot of rum a few minutes before he was brought to hang. You're sure it was that? Or was the noose clumsily applied? I know my business. By my faith, I never knew a woman to be so perpetually washing of herself. Just one moment, my lord, if you'll excuse me. What could there be of such importance that you want to drag me out of my bath? Gold. Oooh, interesting. I knew you would think so, for one who has such constant need of it to keep a safe distance between herself and a debtor's cell. A debtor's cell? This is not your native land, my dear. In England, we have Newgate Jail for those who do not pay their debts. Oh, your influence will protect me. If future prospects fail to favor me, I am like to join you in one myself. Why, Lord Bellomont, a debtor? Twice over, when one considers the identity of my creditor. And who is this very important person? The King. Very soon, I am going to account for the taxes I collected in the West Indies. Are you mad? Playing tricks on His Majesty? Why, it would cost your head! And will! If we fail. We? I promised to make you a great lady, and I will. You shall have wealth beyond your wildest dreams, be presented at court in London, perhaps even given a title. Aren't your promises a little extravagant for a confessed bankrupt? Did you ever hear of a Captain William Kidd? Oh, just the common gossip, which said that when he was hanging from the gallows, you should have been dangling beside him. Ugh. The gossip is wrong in one detail. Oh, you play innocent. How little the cloak of respectability becomes you. No, no, my dear, it was the other detail I was referring to. Oh, you mean the death of Captain Kidd? Precisely. Well, what possible interest could be to us the hanging of a pirate? His survival. His survival? Captain William Kidd lives. Well, what difference could that make to us? Gives us hope, that we may imitate him. You worked a miracle. Was me Lord Bellomont that worked the miracle. And the hangman the trick of it. For me own part, it was one mostly of muscle. Bellomont? I live because of him? For reasons of which you're probably aware. I hope you struck him a pretty penny for your help. Well, Cap'n, me bargaining position was not that good. He promised me pardons and considerable gold to betray you. He must be a sorry judge of men to think you so easily bought. May well be that he values gold greater than all else in life. I wonder... Yet I must get to my treasure. 'Tis the only means I have to buy the King's pardon and clear my name. Well, sir, we'll need a ship, then. That's where we're headin' for now. And here be the means to board her. Ship's papers, for one Henry Peterson, assigned to the Indian Queen as supercargo. And, one Wilbur Waims, ship's cook. When did you get these? Slipped into me hand by a shifty-eyed rascal who disappeared almost before I could eye him properly. Lord Bellomont's work. Giving us an easy road aboard ship. We'll be well to remember that we shall have no friends between her decks. Aye. But we must rise to the bait, a ship we must have. Once aboard, 'twill be easy enough to see how it may best profit us. I do not understand, my Lord. Well, I knew that old rogue Simpson could not be bought to betray Captain Kidd, and that every word I dropped in his ear would find its way back to Captain Kidd's. And you expect Kidd to board the Indian Queen knowing it to be a trap? Precisely. He needs a ship. A ship will be our lure. With an honest captain and mate, to fool the port authorities. Kidd will rise to it. What about the treasure? I don't share your confidence in your plan to use Kidd as the arrow to point the way. There's more than one way to make a point, Captain Avery, as there's more than one way to skin a cat. And Steve Castle here will be the chief skinner. You followed my orders, Castle? Filled the crew with the lowest sweepings of the waterfront? Aye. Men who would sell their own mothers into slavery for a shilling. It won't take much effort to incite these men to mutiny. And when this is done? Comes the most important part of the scheme. To induce Captain Kidd to throw his lot in with the mutineers as their leader, to take us to his treasure. It may not be easy. Take my word for it, Master Castle, it will be easy enough. Captain Kidd fair itches for a ship. And we are going to put one right into his hands. And where exactly do I come into this, my Lord? With Captain William Kidd. You are going to sail with him. Sail? With Captain Kidd? He's known to be a gentleman. No harm will befall you, if you use that clever head of yours and follow my orders exactly. Orders, my Lord? It will be your task to ensure we do not lose sight of Captain Kidd's ship as we sail in his wake. Every night at the end of the middle watch, you will signal us by lantern from your cabin, to make sure we do not go astray. Is that understood? Yes, but why do you need me for such a simple task? Couldn't Steve do it just as well? He will have other things to engage him while aboard. Besides, he's not as beautiful as you. And what may beauty have to do with it? Captain Kidd has a notorious weakness for it, madam. Particularly in women. And if by the time we reach the Indies you've not made him completely your slave, you're not the woman I think you. Peterson. Supercargo, reporting on board, sir. You're late arriving, Mister. On his business ashore, sir. Waims, Captain. Wilbur Waims, reporting to galley, sir. Where's your gear? Uh, stolen from us, at a tavern where we supped. 'Tis of no matter. You can be fitted from the ship's slop chest. Avast there! Who taught you to handle valuable cargo like that? No harm done, Captain, no harm. I'll have no lubbers aboard my ship. You're new here, or you'd know it. Don't be a fool. This isn't the time. I'm... I'm sorry, sir. It seems I haven't found my sea legs yet. Good morning, ma'am. I see you've met my supercargo. Informally, Captain. That's a condition easily altered. Mr. Peterson, Mistress Duvall. She's our passenger for the Indies. I trust you'll find our voyage interesting, ma'am. And what are the duties of a supercargo aboard the ship, Mr. Peterson? He is the owner's representative, watching over the cargo and whatever else may be of value aboard. As the Captain reminded me about you. I am of little value. A poor girl who's going to marry a man she hasn't seen since childhood. 'Tis a criminal sacrifice of youth and love. Of youth, perhaps. Of love, no, for I take none to the arrangement. If there's ought I might do... Those whom I call my friend know me as Jeanine. And those whose friendship I value know me as William. Come in. Eight bells, sir. And the signal? Off the starboard, sir, as usual. Good, that will be all. Aye-aye, sir. Dependable wench, Lady Jeanine. Maybe. But I don't like women in men's business. They can be convenient, Captain Avery. Most convenient. Belay, there. Have you no work to do? It is the end of my watch. Get foreward, you scum, and lay to. "Do this, you scum," he says. "Do that, do this, do that." And he pays us well with kicks. I've had enough of this slave driver. A full belly... I say tonight's as good as any to pay off the score and take over the ship. Aye. Now, you men all know why you're aboard, and grateful you should be for this chance of riches. Riches? Aye, but they can't be spent on the gallows. There's no risk to this venture, lads. The Captain suspects absolutely nothing. Besides, we've the benefit of numbers. A bold attack and the ship is ours. You've had your taste of that dog of a captain. Kicks and blows and he spares no one. I, Pedro Albertos Luis will take care of him. The Captain's not that easily taken, I'm thinkin'. We're all of the same mind, he can't help himself. Believe me. And after we take over the ship, who's to be the captain... you? Fits more to go off piratin' than killing a couple of men. Steve knows what he is doing. Aye. Leave the details to me. I say put the choice of the captain to vote. I'll say what's to be and you'll abide by it. You're not giving me orders, Castle. I'll give 'em and you'll take 'em, Harris. That's to be seen. I'm warning ya. I'm tellin' ye. Now, has anybody else got something to say? Who do you have in mind for the job? None other than one who's aboard ship right now, the greatest pirate of 'em all. Who might that be? Belay the gab, 'tis the cook. Well, me hearties, what fine tribute indeed for me art when I hear naught but silence at your feedin'. You know your trade. The cockles of me heart be warmed by them kind words, matey. I love you all for it. There's talk of mutiny in the mess. The men are ready to take over the ship. Are you certain? Aye. Come with me. Where? Why, to warn the Captain. All right. The time has come. A knife in the ribs, overboard for the old man and the mate, and the loot of the seven seas is ours for the taking. Come now. This suspicion is ridiculous, Mr. Peterson. There's not enough backbone among the whole bunch of them to be a seizing of my ship. Better safe than sorry, Captain. Haha, you alarm easily. There's not a true man among the whole flea-bitten bunch of scum. Try it, any one of you, and I'll hurt you! Over the side with him! A job well done, lads. And now there's a rope for each of our necks waiting on Execution Dock in London. So who isn't with us is against us. All the way. I've heard nothing from you, Mr. Peterson. This adventure you've embarked on is none of my concern. We're all in this together. There'll be no one to step aside and give King's evidence to save his own neck and hang the rest of us. The same goes for you too, matey. There's nothing of value a ship's supercargo can bring to piracy, Mr. Castle. Maybe not. But a lot could be brought to it by Captain William Kidd. Captain William Kidd? He'll take no more ships, the man was hung in London. All England knows that. Ah, wait. The mark of a man's cleverness: to make a whole country believe what's a plain lie. A plain lie? Captain Kidd was not hung? He lives? Not only not hung, not only lives, but he sails aboard the Indian Queen. He calls himself Peterson, the supercargo. What riddle is this? The popinjay of an owner's clerk, the great Captain Kidd? Yes, they hung me in London, or thought they did. Now if it's piracy you've got a leaning for, as I see it is, then I'm your man. But if you're Captain Kidd, what about the treasure you've got hid? You know the law of the brotherhood of the sea. Share and share alike. Aye! Aye, it's to be shared with all who wish to throw in their lot with me. Now, does that answer your question? Men, see to the ship. It's discipline that makes piracy profitable. That's the only way any ship under my command will sail. Now understand that. Take over, Mr. Simpson. Aye-aye, Captain. Well, you heard what the Captain said, back to your work. Fine kettle of fish to fry, now they've made you master of the ship. Could be worse. But they'll expect you to lead 'em straight to your treasure. What they expect and what they may get is another thing. You know, this whole business has the smell of Lord Bellomont about it. He thinks he's nailed the trap tight now. Let him believe so. We'll play along with him until it suits us to claw our way out at the right time. And when might that time be? As soon as we can scrape this bunch of rogues off our backs. My lady, we now sail under the command of Captain William Kidd. Did he suspect anything? No, he jumped at the bait. Good, good. How far are we from port now? A few days. Have you seen anything of my Lord Ballomont's ship? The light is arranged just before daybreak. He continues to sail a true course in our wake. Good. You have done well. Given future success, my lord will award you generously. I had hoped it might be shared with someone on whom I put more value. Meaning? You. Leave these quarters at once. I have to take orders on deck, ma'am, but not in a lady's bedroom. You're mad! Down to the hold, what for? I inspected the cargo. Well, it's no longer your concern, 'cept as prize. That's why I was curious. Jeanine! Let me go! This the way you keep the discipline aboard? The wench invited me. It's a lie! Take care of him, Jay. You'll be safer with me. Well, Master Steve Castle. I've oft argued the merits of hook against knife, and here I am indebted to yah for the opportunity to test my theory. None enters here but me, you'll be secure. You didn't believe what he said, that I invited him? Take care, Miss. That knave needs a lesson in manners. He just learned it. Come. Rubbish! Rags, trash. What sort of cargo be this, Captain? One never meant to reach a port. Well, I'm fair skewered. It just fits the pattern, proves this whole ship is nothing more than Bellomont's mousetrap. Are you sayin' that all these cases and barrels contain the same cargo? Aye. Well, surely, Captain, you're not gonna lead this scurvy pack of mongrels to your treasure! That treasure is the property of the King, and it goes to him to ransom my honor. These swine'll have a different idea once they get their hands on it. Aye. 'Twas the design of this whole mutiny, to force my treasure into the open. And that's why you are going to join those mutineers. Me, join that low-livered bunch of scum? Aye. What's that? This is going to be your most priceless possession. Is it, now? It'll make the rascals itch to be rid of me as eagerly as I wish to be free of them. And what might this priceless possession be, sir? A map of Captain Kidd's secret treasure. Oh, now wait a minute, Captain. Would they be willing to believe that I'd skate you so easily? They see the world as they see themselves, have no fear. Now help me make charcoal copies. Aye, sir. Look ye there. A tremendous fortune staring us in the face. Drawn by Captain Kidd's own hand. And see these three crosses on the map? Beneath them are more millions in gold and jewels than poor men like you and me can even count! Where'd you get it? Stole it off the Captain himself, I did. It's a copy of the original he carries on him. I want you to spread the word to the whole crew, every last one of them. This brew is strong enough to lift the top of a man's head off. Once this is mixed in the water casks, they'll be eager enough to get ashore to refill them. They will at that. Look at those rogues. You'd think the Devil himself was on their tails, the way they rowed them boats ashore. Aye. There'll be precious little water loading until they find what they think lies buried there. Precious little in the way of any treasure on this particular island. But they left three men still aboard. Now, wouldn't you think they'd be as interested as the others in gettin' sand on their boots? Aye. 'Tis behavior worth watching. You lads have no fancy for going ashore? Plenty of time for that, Captain, after you've taken a swim. Say the word, Captain. You want to go overboard with lead ballast in ye? Or free and easy? So, another mutiny, is it? No. Just that, now we've got your treasure, there'll be no need to split it into more portions than needful. You heard Sykes. Overboard. Raise sail! Aye-aye, sir! They're at sea, Captain? Aye. The Indian Queen is well over the horizon. I'm sometimes fearful we may lose sight of her, sailing so far behind by day. Not likely. However fast she may sail, we are faster. And can always depend on seeing her signal during the night by crowding sail. Comforting to know. Our plans have gone along so well thus far, 'twould be a pity if things were to go wrong now. Stop. An unexpected pleasure, ma'am. I... I beg your forgiveness, but I... I couldn't sleep, and I was in some mind for company, but... but when I saw how well you rested, I... I didn't have the courage to disturb you. Nor have you, ma'am. I would have to be up soon in any event to relieve Simpson at the tiller. Join me in a glass of wine? I... I think I'd better be going. That you leave right on the heels of arrival makes me wonder why so little of my company should go so far. Your company means more to me than I care to believe. It's what I would most like to think. Does the security of your island planter mean so much to you, Jeanine? I was dreaming that you should hold me like this, the whole world forgot as if it were made for just you and me. Yet the world has a strange way of intruding. Then there is more reason that we should live each hour as if it were our last. I don't wonder you should think so. Could it be 'twas the secret of my treasure really brought you, and not the impulse of your heart? Or, do you search for another lantern to hang outside your cabin window? What do you mean? What are you talking about? It makes clear a great deal I had suspected. You are no more accident than anything else on this ship. When I stood between you and Steve Castle, I thought 'twas in your defense. My apologies, ma'am, since I see I was merely interrupting a conference between conspirators. It also brings to mind gossip heard in London about my Lord Bellomont and his beautiful friend. Will you deny it? Stand back. Hm. Not from an unprimed gun. Let me go, let me go! What are you planning to do with me? Educate you to a point which will ever cause you to remember Captain Kidd. Are you going to punish me? Mm, that's a harsh word for it. You are the master of the ship. I am a defenseless woman. I am at your mercy. The sooner the fact is accepted, the easier for you. Such an experience is what you have now long lacked. So being you're no passenger aboard this ship any longer, you'll pay for your keep in work. In what kind of a work? In the galley, among other things. What other things? Keeping my clothes cleanly washed. Simpson's too. For he will have other duties. Mayhap standing a trick or two at the tiller. I won't. I won't, I won't, I won't! You're a healthy wench with a suitable appetite, I have no doubt. It's only work pays for vittles aboard my ship. Let me out! Do you hear, let me out! You monstrous pirate, let me out! Oh! Ouch. South by southeast. South by sou'east, aye-aye, sir. Let me go! That's a strange way to say good morning. Let me go! I brought you a little present. Oh no, you didn't! It will put you straight Oh, no! On your unbecoming arse. Let me go, you monstrous pirate, you! Let me go! This is a relic of the days. You're choking me! This ship ran a slave route. ...me go, you! Let me go! Mm. It's a delicious dish, Jay. The very fragrance is a delight. Well, thank you, sir. Do you intend to starve me to death? That is for you to answer. I am not going to wash these dirty rags! Ah, I am well filled. We can stand a little more sail. I'll go hoist. I'll give you a hand, sir. No, I can manage alone. Rest that shoulder, it had an angry look this morning. Pirate, pirate, pirate! It's what I figured all the voyage: we've lost sight of her. The fault's not mine. The wench failed to signal us. I told you it was unwise, putting such confidence in a woman. I wonder what could have happened to her. Who knows? But this is plain: if the Indian Queen can't be seen from our masthead come morning, this fine little plan of yours is finished. Castaways! We been marooned, sir. You mean Captain Kidd's got the ship. Aye, the dog tricked us. 'Tis to his credit. One must admire his wit. Sink me if you ain't a fine pack of lily-livered muddleheads. To let one man so befuddle you! He slipped right through your fists! We've lost him. Get below! That's Turtle Island. We should be anchored there come morning. That's where the treasure is? Aye, and we should have it aboard ship before another day has passed. It's the same loot Captain Avery stole from the Grand Mogul of India when he attacked his treasure ship, and which I in turn took from Avery for the King. Well, there'll be no trouble locating it now, I hope. No, I have the landmarks firmly in mind. I want you to listen carefully so you'll know where to find it if anything should happen to me. It's a small cove on the west side of the island between two arms of jutting rocks. This is the only possible place Kidd could be making for. Only one of these islands has fresh water. The others, a few coconut trees on a couple acres of sand. Sink me, if Kidd is making for Turtle Island, he's like to find it hotter than he counts on. Aye, 'tis my island. It seems still as deserted as when I left it. Lend a hand to lower away the small boat. Aye-aye, sir. Come on. Into the boat, come along! Are you taking me ashore? I'm not leaving you to mischief aboard with only an injured man to keep an eye on you. What are you planning to do with me? Maroon you. Oh, no, no, I beg of you, I... I'm certain that I'll never be able to survive alone! 'Tis your problem, you'll get into the boat. No, no, no! Oh, put her on the deck, Captain, No, no! We'll throw a net. No! No! No, no! No! Be still, you crazy wench! Ow! Put that line around her! We'll hoist her down in the boat. No, we won't! Heave! Here, stay steady, you little vixen. Oh, you! Oh! What are you doing, sitting there? Where do you expect me to sit? At the oars, here, beside me. What do you want me to do, to row? If it's not beneath the Captain's dignity in emergency, it's not strange for you to do likewise. Ohhh! Keep in time with me. I'm trying. Try harder. Ohh! You are remarkably clumsy. What are you doing with your legs up there? Oh! Ow! Ow, you're breaking my neck! Ow! Well, it's to get rid of some of the water you swallowed. Ow, ow! You tried to drown me. Well, if so, then you gave me a lot of help. Ow! Saved my life. 'Twas instinctive. Perhaps you would have preferred if I drowned. No need to worry, the danger's passed. Should have let me die. It was my choice. Even if I told you that everything you've thought about me and... Lord Bellomont were true. He put me on the ship. I was your enemy ever since the beginning. In the past. Yet it's creeping in the present. He and Avery are close behind. That is not hard to guess. They know that you are somewhere in this island, and they are not going to rest until they find you and the treasure. By sundown tomorrow it will be aboard ship, and I shall be on my way to England for a pardon from the King, my name to be cleared. And you are, well, rid of me. After all the trouble I've had making a true woman of you? Hmph. 'Twould be a sad waste, indeed. That's Avery's ship, all right. Who else has such a line and sail? We'd better tell Blackbeard he's here. I'll do it, you watch. Simpson? That didn't come from the Indian Queen. It's on the other side of the island. Come. Hail! We'll share the spoils among the brethren. Is that satisfactory? Who is that brute over there? Never sailed much in these waters, and these gentry are all strangers to me, but I'll wager he's Captain Blackbeard himself. Blackbeard! Captain Blackbeard! I've got news for ye! Whoah there, Captain Calico Jack, you look worn. With reason. I've come at a run from the other side of the island. Captain Avery is here! You're certain of it? It's his ship, the Saucy Sue, only now called the Indian Queen. I'd recognize her rigging anywhere. Remember the ship he picked up after Kidd snatched his own ship? Aye. It's one and the same. Oh, so now we're to be meeting the great Cap'n Avery. And it's curious I am. You've never laid eyes on him before? Nor have any of the brethren here in the West Indies. Avery's been sticking close to Madagascan waters. Shall we get a delegation of the lads to go give him a welcome? Blackbeard goes to meet no man. If Avery wants Blackbeard, let him seek me out. What does he mean, that the Indian Queen is Avery's ship? It's plain enough. Bellomont took Avery's Saucy Sue and christened her with the name Indian Queen for his purpose with me. That pirate must know her lines even if it's never met her master. What are you planning to do? Go into camp. Are you mad? We must. Otherwise, they'll come visiting the ship. 'Twould be quick murder. They'll kill Simpson and search every foot of the island for us. Taking a terrible risk. Audacity: the only road open to us. You are my slave girl, now say no more on your life. Grateful I am for the welcome, lads. It's Captain Avery! Who is the leader here? I am. Your service, Cap'n Blackbeard. What kind of leadership is this that puts up no sentries, so a man and his wench may walk undetected right into camp? There's naught on this island but the brethren. Yet if I were not Captain Avery, there would be. You conduct your business like amateurs. Look to it, Captain Avery, you're not in Madagascan waters. We'll not be takin' talk like that here. You have objections, Captain? With a sword to back 'em up. Mm. 'Tis curious I am to hear you speak them, Captain. And I am not a patient man. 'Twas not meant to be a threat. If Captain Blackbeard has thought better of his words, has anyone else the wish to express them for him? Then we'll get down to business. Captain Blackbeard, post sentries. Every master's crew to supply them a two-hour relief. Whose tent is that? Mine. It will make suitable headquarters for me. He's all has been said of him. And more. Gentlemen! A toast to our venture. And now, Captain Blackbeard, if you will present our good company. If you're one for formalities. Cap'n John Ward. Who was sailing on the Account before most of us here saw the light of day. It is a pleasure and a privilege to serve under the greatest of the gentlemen on the Account. The greatest to sail the Seven Seas since the glorious days of Henry Morgan, with whom I also had the honor to serve. May our deeds equal those of our predecessors! Cap'n Bartholomew, the Portugee. It is an honor to serve the famous Captain Avery. May we win much wine, women, and doubloons. Captain Roberts. I cannot hold with the sentiments expressed by the proceeding speaker. Wine, wenches: you'll find none of them aboard my ship. Early to bed and up with the sun, with grace at meals and prayer on the Sabbath, that's my recipe. And a good one it is, too, as 400 ships seized will prove. Captain L'ollinaise, the Devil's own rival himself. This is the right ear of the Spanish Admiral Qintago. This the left of the Spanish Capit?n Esperentho. The rest... After the sixth bottle of wine, my memory is not too good. To the second string of quality ears I hope Captain Avery will provide me! Last but not least, Captain Anne Bonney. To Captain Avery! For old times. Beautiful specimen. Where did you get it, Captain? From a Spanish nobleman who has no more use for it. You appreciate fine pieces of art, Captain? They please the eye. Tell me, what do you think of this one? Another choice specimen of Spanish art, the daughter of a nobleman who was induced to make me a present of it. Here, let him look at ya. Choice, isn't she? Exceptional. She's taken a sudden dislike to me. Shows nothing of her fire. It's tiring. Tell you what I'll do. I'll trade you her for that one. I haven't tired of this one yet. I'll throw in the candelabras. Not interested. You're out of your head. Those candelabras are worth a dozen wenches. You should know. But I'm in a generous mood. And an offensive one. It's too good a party to spoil with peckishness. Two silver candelabras... For that? The Captain and I have something to say, being old friends. Off with you, wench! Why, you! Let me go! I'll murder her, let me go! Ah! Let me go! Now, it's obvious she's acquainted with Avery. What? What are we going to do if she talks? You will have to get back to the ship. Warn Simpson. See the guns are loaded and ready to stand out to sea on a second's notice. We may have to swim for it. Are you afraid? Only for you, my love. Captain, how you've changed. What's your game? What's yours? You're free to denounce me in there. The stakes must be of great value that you're willing to risk so much. Say, perhaps, to the total of ?10 million? Wasn't that the sum of the treasure you took from Captain Avery... Captain Kidd? So you're acquainted with Avery? I was sweetheart to the rogue till he cast me off for a lighter love. I'm willing to make a bargain with you. But the details will have to be talked over secretly come morning. I'll keep my eye out for you, Captain. Water! What's that? The others are dead. Only this one still breathes. What does this mean? It's an idea Captain L'ollinaise suggested to Blackbeard, who carried it out. These are some of Admiral Granville's men, placed aboard a seized ship as prize crew, which Blackbeard captured in his turn. 'Tis the risks of the game? Aye. It's the risk. And I can see you're not a man to avoid them. Water. Drink easy. If I can get you off the island, will you bring back Admiral Granville and his fleet? Aye, or die in the trying. But the Admiral has no fleet. His ship is on a pirate-chasing mission in these waters. Mm, well then warn him of what lies afoot. Captain! Gracias, Se?orita. Tengo mucho... I speak the English. It's greatly obliged I am to you. We'll lay them here? Aye. Now listen, there's a boat down at the beach. Now hurry, the two of you. God bless you, Se?or. Good luck. Jeanine! Simpson! Ahoy! Now take him below! Well, we were expecting you, Captain. What have you done with her? You, uh, you refer to Mistress Duvall? Have they harmed you? Oh, such a scene I relish. He's been fair smitten. It's as good as any comedy at Drury Lane. You Judas spawn. It's not discrete, Captain, to insult a lady. Away with him. All right, get in there. All right, Simpson. Put the irons on him. Caught me like a fool, they did. I was asleep when they came aboard from their ship. She sneaked in before midnight without lights. How's your wound? It's on the mend. Well, it's no use crying when the milk is spilt. I should have had more faith, but you played your part amazing well. I had to. It meant our lives. Longboat alarms? They struck me down. The woman's with them. Bring the guns to bear. No, you fool, we need Kidd alive. Get the boats overside. ?10 to the man who takes Kidd. They're lowering their boats over the side, sir. William! I warned you, Captain. A few twists of this cord about your head, and your eyes will bulge till they burst from their sockets. So speak. Where is that treasure? Very well. On your head be it. Ha ha ha, an excellent jest, milord. "On your head be it." It's on his head. Let him now feel it. Please, my Lord. Mr. Simpson, we shall give you the honor of persuading the Captain to talk. But no tricks, as you value your scurvy life. Well, Captain? Get to work on him. One full twist whenever I command. One full twist. In your case, Captain, silence will not prove golden. You still think otherwise? Another turn. Still not talking, Captain? Another turn. Another turn! No! And may you rot in all the bilges of every ship I sail! Simpson. Do as he says. Better one dies than both. No! Good advice, Captain. It's unfortunate you cannot advise yourself equally well. Another turn. No. I'll tell you where the treasure is. Keep hold of your tongue. It's not worth the sacrifice, Captain. Free him and I'll tell ya! No! Mr. Simpson, this is a command. You cannot trust them. No, I'll tell ya. Free him and I'll tell ya! You'll do more than that, you mangy dog. You'll take us. Release him! If you've played some trick on us, we'll not leave this hole empty. Keep digging here. I've struck something! Diamonds, jewels, gold! Take them to the boats. I'm telling you, the dog struck me down from behind. And almost a whole day it took you to find me! You were unconscious and silent nigh on six hours, Captain. Nobody thought to go anywhere near the prisoners, or do anything about 'em. Ah, let that learn you a little more diligence. Treasure! And treachery! Avery and the ship's crew are on the point, just dug it up and loadin' it onto boats. To your swords! Please, my Lord, have mercy. You have the gold. Would you expect as much from a pack of hungry jackals, milady? Hang the dogs, and let's be off. I regret omitting formalities, Captain. Seems it's the second time I'm to be hung without speech. You'll find conversation enough with the Devil. Kick him off! L'ollinaise, I'll get you a pair of human ears personally. Strike me, it's Anne Bonney! To the boats! After them! Sink me for a fool, but I... It's odd... I should fall for... a pirate catcher. Quick, with me. To the boats! Pirate! Well, we can't stay here. Let's go down to the hold. Retreat! Raise sail! They're sailing. To our ships. We'll follow 'em to Hades if need be. We've only got one and its yours. The rest are aground on a beach. Aye, and mine will outsail any I know. To her! Well, that puts a reef in the old rogue's sail. Not for long. I'll wager a hundred pounds he's going back to his ship. He means to exchange broadsides with us. Well, then let's show him our heels. We have the treasure aboard, that's all I'm interested in. Blackbeard's ship is fast, and her guns are heavier. Then we waste time talking. Let's put distance between us. Now we'd better see what chance to rescue Jeanine. And the treasure. That will be our second purpose, if possible. Sink me if I don't draw those fangs. See if it's clear down there. Aye-aye, sir. Ask Captain Avery to step on deck. Aye-aye, sir. Blackbeard's ship is close to... Stay close to me. We're closing in on them fast. More sail! Aye-aye, sir. Get Captain Avery on deck. Aye-aye, sir. What's this? Captain Avery's stretched out down below, sir. Looks dead. And Captain Kidd almost did the same for me. Kidd, aboard? In the cabin. Follow me. There's one chance in a hundred of getting into the boat, escaping the blast, and having the fortune to be picked up by the Admiral. What be the plan, Captain? Burn the ship. We'll take our chances on the open seas. Burn the ship? What about the treasure? We lie between two devils, and I don't want either of the rogues to put his hands on it. 100 pieces of gold for his head! Get me that she-cat alive and I'll make her a present to the crew! One step near and 'twill be your last! He's bluffing. My lord, my lord! Magazine's on fire, it could blow up any minute! Come back! Come back, you miserable cowards! Put a shot across their bow! Aye-aye, sir! Give her a broadside! Give her another broadside! Abandon ship! She'll blow any minute, over the side! Come lad, they bear down on us fast. No, Captain, save yourselves. I'm done for. And leave you to these jackals? Never. The girl, she's dependin' on you. 'Twould be throwin' away all our lives, but not to gain. Just the same, we fight. It'll have to be another day for you, Cap'n, now go! If it's treasure you're seeking, I'm bringin' it to ya! Come and get it! A sail! Granville. And then they attacked my ship. And because of their own greed, they were destroyed. We escaped in the boat. Admiral, the tale is done. And well done, Captain. The world of honest seafarers is in your debt. And London should pay for it. London? If he's taken to London, he'll be hanged. Hanged? How does one hang a man who does not live? Oh, Captain Kidd is dead to every man's belief. I have only to show my face there, sir, to have them think otherwise. It might have been different had I returned with treasure, but that is at the bottom of the sea. Whoever wants it now may search for it. I see your point, Captain. London would be an embarrassment for you. But London is but one small spot on the face of the globe. 'Tis a wide world. The choice of many lands is yours. That is the least we may offer you. And where we are together. It's strange, the odd places men may find great treasure.
