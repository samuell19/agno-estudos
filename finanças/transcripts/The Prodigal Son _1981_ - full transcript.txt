Foshan is a big town in Jiangnan. It is said that back then Foshan had three treasures: Taoist Paper Art, the Great Buddha, and Mr. Tsan. FOSHAN TEAHOUSE Mr. Tsan, born Leung Tsan, came from a wealthy family. Fond of martial arts practice since childhood, he once pledged himself to over a dozen martial arts instructors. He was happiest when fighting injustice. He was unmatched wherever he went. That's why people called him "The Street Fighter". Master Tsan, good morning... You're so early today? Your seat's reserved upstairs. Please go up. Master Tsan's here. Hey, Master Tsan! Your fight at the Great Buddha's mouth day before last was a sight to behold. Master Tsan, good morning. How was it more awesome than his fight here yesterday? Anyway, your coming to this teahouse is a blessing to us all. I'm flattered... Waiter, put these tables on my tab. Thank you, Master Tsan! - Hey, waiter... - Coming... Make us some of the good stuff, then! Got it... What's the matter? There's a way. Eh? Speak louder! You know I'm a bit deaf. Didn't you say you wanted to open a martial club in Foshan? Looking like that, who'd want to learn from you? Right. - So you need to make a name for yourself. - Right. So we look for the best martial artist in Foshan, - and take him down. - Right. That way, the fools in Foshan will respect you, - and be lining up to learn your kung fu. - Right. We've already found the right man for you. Oh, where? There, that kid on the other side. Who's he, then? It's The Street Fighter, Leung Tsan. In that case, turn the table over! Yes! Idiots! Don't turn over this table, turn over his table! Move aside! Never mind him. Let's order something to eat. Come on! You... are The Street Fighter, Leung Tsan? Young Master... Well said. Then you're out of luck! - Get him! - Yes! Don't hit me... You really deserve the name, The Street Fighter. So you still dare open a martial club? I won't open it. I'm going home to open a culinary club! - Then why haven't you gone yet? - I'm going... Let's go! My goodness! Young Master, are you alright? It's nothing! Of course, I'm alright. Master Tsan, whenever you fight, they clear out upstairs and downstairs! You see, you've broken so much. And-- Hey, put it all on my tab. Oh, thank you... Hey, he's coming. Wonderful... You really looked the part. Nothing comes for free. You know what to do. Right... Here. That won't do. What about when I fell down? No one asked you to jump down. This is peanuts! It won't even cover the cost of medicine. We agreed on a price for the entire show. Get going, or you guys won't get any gigs again! Actually, his true nickname was "The Street Briber". Those who couldn't look past it, would behind his back call him: "The Prodigal Son". Red Nose, come here. Red Nose, can't you come here? OK... May I ask, is the man seated upstairs The Street Fighter, Leung Tsan? Yeah, what of it? Iron Sand Palm... Today, you've finally found an opponent. - What're you going to do? - Chop someone! - Chop who? - Leung Tsan! Hey... Big Brother, what do you have against Master Tsan? - Money. - Oh, that's easy. I'll offer one tael. Fixed price, five taels. Two taels? Chop... Three taels? Chop... Four taels at most. That's all I have. Chop a few times more. So you are smart. - Who's smart? - Oh, no... I'm just saying your attendant's really smart. Yeah, he's like a brother to me. Yee Tung-Choi, come have something to eat. Right, sit down... Master Tsan, indulge yourself. This meal... is on you. Money... is not a problem. Our Ah Tsan is the sole ninth generation heir. You mustn't let anyone hurt him. I know what I'm doing. Now Young Master truly believes he's Foshan's famous Street Fighter. Even if he were The Street Fighter, I'd still want The Street Briber. You never know. All it takes is someone to slip up and end up hurting my Ah Tsan. Wow! Master Tsan, how on earth has your kung fu improved so quickly? We brothers combined are no match for you. Right! - Because both masters taught me well. - Master Tsan. - Masters. - Young Master Man... Young Master Man, nothing better to do? Why don't we spar a bit? - Yeah, spar a bit... - Count me out! You're the famous Street Fighter. I'll easily fall apart! So what do you want with me? Fancy seeing the opera together tonight? Pfft! All that "Cha Chang, Duk Chang" Even I know how to do that. Hey, which troupe are we seeing? Lok Fung Nin. This wine is not sweet, nor is it sour. A perfect match for your tastes, Second Master. If it is as you say, put it down. - 'tis better you receive it... - Put it down... Heavens! A "put it down" is a "put it down". Must you raise your voice? - Bravo... - Sit down! A "bravo" is a "bravo". Must you raise your voice? - It's really good, though! - Jinlian starts to smile. Second Wu listens to the slave. When doing something, do it well, despite fears that strangers will tell. - Someone will tell. - No one will tell. - Someone will talk. - No one will talk. If you won't talk and I won't talk, who is to know? Nonsense! Whoa, that huadan (actress) is rather coquettish. Yeah, you drooling again? - It's filling up the back of my throat! - Gossip eventually reaches peoples' ears. I return to the courthouse to settle in for the night. I take my leave. Here, two days ago you got to show off. Today it's finally my turn, right? - You know what to do. - Sure! If you want to leave, then leave. Does it even matter? Soon when your brother returns, I will accuse you and then you will pay. Hey... Come on! Hey, your turn. Hey... Move faster, will you? Excuse me-- You want to ask what brings me here. Let me tell you, this is our turf. - Then you've come for the protection fee? - No, nothing so vulgar. We want to invite your huadan out for supper. Huadan? Which of our huadans? The one that played Pan Jinlian just now. Pan? - Oh, you mean him... - I'm here. Let me talk to them. My God! Move it! Your performance was really great! Indeed, your flirtatiousness was truly rapturous. - Hey! - Sorry! You're too kind. Please, come in and sit. She invited us in. Come... Yes, sit... Your face is really smooth. What's your name? My surname's Leung, call me Yee-Tai. Yee-Tai? Even the name's enchanting. Yeah. Let's go to supper tonight. Supper? And following that... - That's not supper, you scoundrel! - Whatever you say. Thanks, but I never go out. So you won't give us face!? My goodness, what face do you want me to give? We gave you face just then by inviting you out for supper. You failed to appreciate our favour, now you better watch out for us! What...? - Huh...? - What's with the "huhs"? Jeez! That's enough... What're you afraid of? If we don't show these actors who's boss, why would they have supper with us? Right? Fierce, huh?! You're so fierce, I must give you face. That's better. Now you're playing nice. Trick me?! Let me give you a taste of my Five-Clawed Golden Dragon! Panda... What's so funny? Help me out already! Bitch, you're really too arrogant! How can I match up to you garlic heads?! You dare call us garlic heads? Allow me. What's the matter? - Don't fight! - Get lost! Beat him up! - Stop! Don't fight! - Don't come over! - Now I'm mad! - Don't fight... Don't move! Damn brat, who do you think you are? Daring to stir up trouble at Lok Fung Nin?! Over there! - Next time, dare you be so impudent? - I daren't! I know I was wrong. Go! Now I've given you ample face. Huh? How come you now have a man's voice? You fool! He is a man! Hurry up and go, or the best is yet to come. Fine! Leung Yee-Tai, you better watch out! Let's go! You better watch out yourself! You! We never get any respect when we come out with you. You talked us into letting you show off. Next time you do this, count us out. Let's go... - "Ho, che". - Off-key. - "Ho, che". - You strike the wrong tone with me, too! Still want to show off? It's his turn, not yours. - Climb up. - Climb. Hey, which one's Leung Yee-Tai? I don't know. Which of you is called Leung Yee-Tai? I am. Hmm... you've even dragged along your boys. Afraid, huh? My goodness! I'm so afraid, I can't even breathe. Isn't that so? Well? What're you laughing at? Don't you know who I am? What's your name? My surname's Leung, first name Tsan. People in Foshan call him Master Tsan. That's correct. Oh, so it's the famous Street Briber. The Prodigal Son, that's you. What's this Street Briber? He's called The Street Fighter. - Really? - That's right! In Foshan, I've fought roughly 200-300 times. I won every time. That's not enough to be The Street Fighter? That's not what I heard. People say that you've always been The Street Briber. Men are paid to lose to you, so a family's precious only son can walk away without a scratch. - You're talking nonsense! - Young Master, calm down... Don't get angry. Let me talk to him. Hey, don't blow our cover. I can always pay you, as well. - Really? How much? - Standard rate. One tael per punch, five for a knockdown, fifty to spit blood. See, your stooge's trying to pay me off. If we strike a deal, I won't expose your dirty secret. You bastard! - You better let go! - I won't let go. You won't let go? Fine! Let me show you what this Street Fighter's capable of. Never mind him. Let's rehearse. You're a piece of work. A beating to wipe that smirk. A smack... Smacked so he's lost his course. Watch out, or a few moves from me, and you'll fall off your horse. A joke... Even so I won't feel fear. Although you talk of fighting, I'm the real expert here. Slap your face again. Splat like dough again. When I'm angry, you can't hold your own, at all. You act like a spoiled brat. I'm just like your mum with that. I Stab, Claw, and Hang! A whimper, not a bang. Don't go talking crap. You're worse than tiles that crack! My temper's out of sight. Then give up on this fight. I'll fight... Who goes there? Your name, at once! I'm your dad! - My old man's really impressive. - I'm formidable, too! - My old man's really handsome. - I'm handsome, too! - My old man's got the clap. - I've got the cl-- Making a fool of me? Damn ladyboy, you used trickery! Alright. I'll show you the real thing. Think only you know the horse stance? I know it, too. Young Master, your posture's really good. Pity it's not practical. Oh, Young Master! I haven't shown real strength. Haven't shown real strength? Our young master's showing blood! Your kung fu's truly rubbish. I don't accept that! Leung Tsan, you best study a few more years before trying to fight. Go! Ah, Young Master! - Leung Yee-Tai, you... - Not convinced? I want you to tell me the truth. - My kung fu's really that bad? - Correct. Your kung fu doesn't even have a basic foundation. Anyone who's ever truly learnt kung fu could beat you. You're talking nonsense! Young Master, don't believe him... Could it be that all my masters have been deceiving me? They must eat your food, live with you, take a monthly wage, lose every fight to you. How did you know? Anyone with a brain would know. Only you're that stupid! Young Master... Young... I can't take it. Go! Young Master! Brother Tai, why didn't you throw a few more punches? All blood red. Six. Whoa! Master Tsan, how come you're so fit today? If you two can't beat me today, then pack your things and go! Hey, looks like it's fight and go, or don't fight and go. Damned if we do, damned if we don't! He usually gives us a right beating. We have to make up for it before we leave today. Young Master... Don't fight... Hurry up and get out! Pfft! We're just going. Think he's the only "prodigal son" in Foshan? Brother, let's go! Young Master... Go away! Ah Choi, I never treated you as a servant. I always treated you like a brother. Still you lied to me! And when have I treated you like a young master? I venerate you like an ancestor. Fine. Now everything's out. I was wrong. I'll take the blame. I'm going! Where are you going? I'm going to sit down here! You think this is good for me? I know... I was wrong. You think when people say bad things behind your back, that my heart doesn't break? But, it was Master who told me to do it. If you want to scold someone, scold your father! Your doing this has turned me into The Prodigal Son. I... Master. Ah Tsan, I just didn't want others to hurt you. Am I not hurt now? Dad, if you don't want others to hurt me, then find me a master who can actually teach me martial arts. I won't accept an undeserved reward. Elder Leung, please take these things back. Master Leung, the boy really admires your kung fu. I hope you let bygones be bygones, and accept him as an apprentice. Master. Master Tsan, I'm incapable of accepting you as an apprentice. Mas... Thank you for the wake-up call. Otherwise, I'd still be dreaming. Then you're done thanking me? I'm about to appear on stage. Master Leung, accept me! I won't teach my kung fu to profligate sons only looking to show off. I've resolved to turn over a new leaf, and study martial arts diligently. Once you've mastered it, you'll revert to your old ways. Then I could do nothing to you. I swear, you can believe me. Ah Tsan, let's go home. I'm not going. You go back first. - Discuss it at home. - Hey, I said leave me alone. My heart... Master Leung, even if you refuse to accept me, I've decided to study under you. Young Master! Master. Young Master. I heard that Lok Fung Nin is going to the Capital. Dad, this time you have to help me. And when haven't I helped you? Tell me that. Hey, Lok Fung Nin's boat is here! We've arrived. Hey, we've arrived... Stop playing. Tidy up. Tidy up. Brother Tai, what's tasty in the Capital? It's Tung Kee's half fat barbecued pork, of course. - I'll buy it for you later. - Good. Why are you here? Brother Tai, I'm now a Lok Fung Nin stuntman, and your personal assistant. Nonsense! What do you know about performing? Almost there. You guys, get ready. Hold on... Troupe leader, why did you let him get on the boat? He's a stuntman, and your personal assistant. Nonsense! How's he qualified to be a stuntman? His father bought Lok Fung Nin. I too just work for a living now. He can be Jesus if he wants. Still say you're not prodigal? Now you've even wasted your father's money buying Lok Fung Nin. This isn't being prodigal. I found out that since Lok Fung Nin's establishment, you guys turn a profit every year. I paid a reasonable price to buy out your troupe. This is called a solid investment. You talk too much! Hey, step ashore... - Leung Tsan. - What's up? I won't accept you, no matter what. Don't waste your effort. Oh? I'll keep following you until you agree to accept me. Fine. See how long you can follow me. - Yuk-Gwai, I really like your acting. - Thanks... - Don't jump in if you can't swim. - I was desperate to save you! Brother Tai, you're really good as Pan Jinlian. You embody the role. How can this be? This guy's always playing tricks on us. So what's to be done? - Ah, got it! - What? From now on, you attack me anytime, anywhere. Train me to become impervious to plots and traps. How can I? You want me to have a master, don't you? Alright. Are you tired of living?! You told me to attack you anytime, anywhere. Get me a change of clothes! You'd be better off returning to Foshan and living the life of a young master. Until the day I've learnt your kung fu, I'm not going anywhere. Then be prepared for a long stay in the Capital. LOK FUNG NIN OPERA TROUPE - Hey, what took you so long? - Hurry up and take your spot. Get ready. Brother Gwai, you're playing Lord Guan tonight? Jeez, do you have to be so arrogant? Won't even answer me! Hey... Hey, don't try and talk to him. He's not allowed to speak. Why? He's playing Lord Guan. Once he puts on his face, he becomes a god. So he can't speak. Otherwise, there'll be disaster. Why so many of these trivialities? So many? The rules of the opera dictate that one must cleanse their body before taking on the role of Lord Guan. When the opera is complete, he must imprint his face on a mock ingot, burn it in a fiery cauldron, then kowtow three times for Lord Guan to leave his body, before wiping his face clean. Now he can speak. Hey, you can speak now. What did he say? Swearing?! Ridiculous! I was unaware that Young Lord Ni had graced us with his presence. Excuse my not coming out to greet you. Your humble servant will arrange a banquet immediately. No need. I wish for my visit to Guangzhou to be discreet this time. My purpose for travelling south is to find experts to test my skills. In that case, your humble servant can make suitable arrangements. No need, Magistrate. This matter doesn't require your concern. Better you hurry and prepare a room for our lordship to rest first. As you bid, your humble servant will see to it right away. Could it be that not a single expert resides in Jiangnan? Boss, give me half a roast goose. OK. I want a roast goose thigh. - I want two chicken thighs, left thighs. - Here you go. Yee Tung-Choi, are you mental? You were the one who told me to attack anytime, anywhere. I didn't tell you to hit that hard! If Leung Yee-Tai hit you, it'd be harder than that! Where did you get this thing? It's ash wood, real solid. Hitting someone really hurts. - I'm not convinced. - Not convinced? Find someone to hit, then you'll know. Ah, who should I find? What's the matter, Ah Gwai? This time, I'm dead! Why? It's all my own fault. I never let a woman go to waste. I accept their advances without question. Who knew one of them was the instructor's wife? I warned you from the start! I heard talk that the instructor's going to kill me. This time, I have no choice but to run. With you on the run, who's going to play Lord Guan? Doesn't matter who plays him. My life's the important thing. Hey, just have your assistant Ah Tsan do it. Are you for real?! Go then if you must! Thank you very much, Brother Tai! Excuse me. Hey, they're about to bang the gong, where are you off to? - Hey! - Ah Tsan! Coming! Brother Tai, what's up? Didn't you say you came to be a stuntman? Yeah, my physicality's not bad! Good. Tonight, you're playing Lord Guan. - Buy some papaya? - Bugger off! Stay sharp, light a joss stick. I'm going on stage. Hey, remember you mustn't speak! Master, we don't know Au Yuk-Gwai. They're performing The Three Heroes Battle Lu Bu. He's Lord Guan. As soon as you see Lord Guan, beat him up! Oh, Lord Guan! Are you playing Lord Guan tonight? Why would there be two? Our young master has always played Lord Guan. My young master's signature act is: Lord Guan studies the Spring and Autumn Annals under the moon. Damn, it's not like I can speak. You bastard! Seducing my wife?! Huh? "Ouch", is it? I hit, then you cry 'ouch'! Advance! Sweet olives... You guys! Troupe leader, these guys are really vicious! Hey, what did they beat you for? "I DON'T KNOW WHAT FOR EITHER!" Master, he's got such a guilty conscience he won't even talk back! Castrate him! My goodness! What a disaster! Goodness knows I hate furrowing my brow, for there is no limit to my worries. That huadan's pretty good. That's nothing, the actor playing Lord Guan's even better. Why did Lord Guan enter the stage like that? I don't know, maybe the opera's changed? You needn't be so impatient. It's not your turn yet, Young Master. - Advance, then! - Yes! Master... You better get out of here. Let's go... Quickly! Quick, onto the stage! Young Lord Ni, do you still recognise me? If you hadn't spoken, I really wouldn't have recognised you. Young Lord Ni, you crippled my right hand. But, never could you have imagined that I would spend five years perfecting this left hand. Tonight, I want to again see which of us is better. Alright. Well? Still not convinced? Then go spend another five years perfecting your legs, so you can challenge our lordship again. Go! Tomorrow night, invite Leung Yee-Tai and the Lok Fung Nin troupe to supper. Yes... What's with your smoker's voice tonight? I was rubbing ointment last night on that stupid boy's bruises. So I went to bed late and have a bad taste in my mouth. Watch your asthma doesn't recur. Dinner time! - Oh, it's dinner time. - OK, let's eat first. Fill my rice bowl for me. Dinner time, Brother Tai! Finally, he couldn't take it and has gone. Brother Tai! Walking before your injuries have healed? Disregarding your own life? Want to die? Go far away. Don't drag Lok Fung Nin down with you. I was worried Brother Tai wouldn't have enough to eat, so I bought a bowl of barbecue pork. It's not too fat or lean. You needn't be so kind. Who says I have to eat the barbecue pork that you bought? If your bruises clot, you'd die and no one would know! You think I can't have dinner without barbecue pork? Go and rest! Don't eat it, then! Stir-fried pipis. Fish congee. Hey, don't be impolite. OK, you've told us many times. We've been expecting you. Everyone, please. Go on. Better not. Watch where you're going. Master Leung, please. Go on. How can you be rude to Master Leung? Oh, it doesn't matter. A bit of light exercise before a meal is usually good for the appetite. - Please. - Don't mention it. An expert. Now, wait for me tonight, eh? I raise a toast to everyone. Thanks... Master Leung, I saw your skill on stage last night. I, Nifei, am full of admiration. No, thank you for supporting the show. Come, on behalf of Brother Tai I drink a toast to you. Considering Master Leung's accomplishments, wouldn't you say it'd be a pity if he didn't meet a worthy opponent? Young Master, he doesn't know what he's talking about! If there had been worthy opponents, I would've been overwhelmed long ago. You think I wanted to play Lord Guan? I was coerced by some villains, is all. Right... for a first time as Lord Guan it was pretty good. I've travelled the length and breadth of both sides of the Yangtze River. No one who wishes to remain anonymous can escape my eyes. What a dick! We're just itinerant entertainers with flowery fists and fancy footwork. Brother Tai, you needn't be modest in front of him. Excessive modesty equals hypocrisy. If you've got the goods, you've got the goods, right? I don't know why, but whenever I see an expert my hands and feet itch. I, too, used to have this problem. However, I finally got cured. Tell me, how did Master Leung get cured? One word: Restraint! Unfortunately, I don't have that word in my vocabulary. It's always been my habit to compare notes with others. Hey, what's he on about? Young Master, what you can't understand in a day, I can't understand in a year! If I compared notes with someone every time I ate a meal, wouldn't I, Leung Yee-Tai, be too busy? Right! You think learning from Brother Tai is that easy? Master Leung, you must see that I'm very sincere. The time and place are up to you. The place is our theatre, obviously. As for the time, we have matinees and evening shows. You're so loaded, you can book out both-- When adults speak, children don't interrupt! Sorry, but in two days we'll be on stage elsewhere. Forgive me, I don't have time to accompany you. Since Master Leung's so busy, why don't we compare notes here? My God! You're going too far! How can you force him? Brother Tai, this sort thinks because they know a few songs they can play the lead. Just let him take the chance to make a fool of himself. Stupid kid, he's challenging me to a fight! Looks like... there's no avoiding this time. Hey, let's get going! Oh, come on! Sampan congee! Brother Tai, why are you just standing there? What's up? Is someone fighting? It's pretty painful when this fellow grinds down with those rings. His kung fu's very powerful. Brother Tai... are you alright? Master Leung is stricken by illness? If he wasn't, think you'd still be standing?! Busybody! You're worthy of being called a Wing Chun expert. If I, Nifei, took advantage of your precarious position, victory would be hollow. Master Leung, once you've recuperated, I'll seek your instruction once again. Lord Sun, Lord Luo. At ease. You have summoned this lowly official so late, I'm unsure what my instructions are? It's Prince Seng's instruction. Oh, the venerable Prince Seng, he... Prince Seng most dearly loves his son, Nifei. Before we accompanied him out, Prince Seng issued a secret order. Although Fei has mastered secrets and traditions from beyond the Great Wall, I fear that no matter how skilled he is, there will always be someone better. This time, he's travelling south incognito to learn martial arts from the Han. You must protect him well. Don't let the least bit of harm come to him. The young lord has a mighty temper. If we encounter a real expert, what should we do? By hook or by crook... kill the experts first. But... If you encounter difficulties... Insignia and servant are present. I humbly await my orders. Select 20 elite fighters immediately. - Stand by to execute orders. - Aye! Remember, you mustn't let His Lordship know. Aye! Doctor, how's he doing? His is a chronic condition. I can only treat the symptoms now. I'll first write out a prescription. Master, it's all my fault. Right, it's your fault. But stop calling me master. I never accepted you as an apprentice. If I hadn't been beaten, Brother Tai wouldn't have been forced to intervene. If Brother Tai hadn't intervened, Nifei wouldn't have been drawn here. If Nifei hadn't been drawn here, Brother Tai wouldn't have fought him. If Brother Tai hadn't fought him, your old illness wouldn't have recurred. If your old illness hadn't recurred, then... If... If you keep going back like that, then everything would be fine if you'd never been born. Stupid! The prescription's been written. Here. See the doctor off. Doctor, please. Doctor, please. Damn you, buddy! Sneak attacking me at a time like this?! Doctor, please. Ha! Even using a knife now! Lucky I didn't get ambushed! You've even called in help! Whoa! Are you for real? LEUNG Buddy! Don't kill me! Even if you pull a knife, I'm not scared of you. So he's talking in his sleep. What's the matter? I just had a nightmare where someone stabbed me! Jeez! You're crazy! Ah, go back to sleep! Causing a ruckus in the middle of the night, I swear... Troupe leader! Who the hell are you? Why are you killing us members of Lok Fung Nin? Kill! While he's ill, take the kill! Yee Tung-Choi... Yee Tung-Choi, did you just try to hack me to death? Yee Tung-Choi?! Could it be that wasn't him? Brother Tai! It's you! Brother Tai, Cross the Boat! Brother Tai, come on! Help me... - Brother Tai, go out the back. - And you? Forget about me! Go! Quick, have someone give chase! Hurry up, cut them off! You guys, look around! They're nowhere! Let's go! Skinny. What is it, Dad? Dad's martial arts has reached its pinnacle. Starting today, I will practice until I master pen and sword. Can you even do that? Why can't I? Hand me the brush. Now, Chinese calligraphy has four words of truth: These are... clear, upright, level, strong. What is clear? The eyes must be clear. The body must be upright. The stance must be level. The brush must be held strong. As the saying goes, power passes through the brush tip. Wow! Dad, your words penetrate the paper! Needless to say. - Skinny, change it over. - OK. Dragons and Snakes follow one's brush with vigorous touches and fine strokes. Why am I feeling dizzy? Dad, the paper's over here. This move's called: Drunkard Takes Up the Brush. Is that true or false? Galloping on the Plains. A Thousand Troops in One Sweep. Dad, you're holding the brush head. What do you know?! This move's called: Beating the Ginger. Sketch in Light Shades. The Rivers Overflow Daily. Heavenly Steed Soars the Skies. Dad, that's great! Needless to say. Dad, your waist strength's great. No chance of failure. No chance of failure... unless I fall down. Dad, this move must be: Breathe Heavily Like an Ox. Skinny, this is your dad's first-ever completed painting and calligraphy. A gift for you. Can I refuse it? Of course, you can't! Here. The highest level of calligraphy practice is when there are words in the picture... and a picture in the words. "I LOVE DADDY" Skinny, you must remember. To your country have loyalty. To the universe have respect. To your parents have piety. To your friends have trust. Then how do I treat Uncle? What "Uncle"? Uncle came back last night, he seemed to be sick. That ladyboy, joining the theatre at his age. Of course, he's sick. Take him something to tide him over. I've prepared a pig and three chickens. Say what? You want him to get indigestion? That won't do. Just give him two eggs, that's it. - Smaller ones, too. - Who says the chickens laid any eggs? Chickens are born to give birth. Hang it up. So why didn't mum give birth again after I was born? Eh? Was your mother a chicken?! Ah, you're a fat one! The so-called fat bird is a fat bird just like you. Let me take a peek at your bum first. A perky bum! Looks like you've never given birth. Hmm? You've got lopsided breasts! Don't look at me like that. I'm getting a taste of you for sure! I'm going to have my fill. Have my fill!? Fill of what?! Enough! Hit me again and I'll make a move on you! My Goodness! Make a move on me? Dad, someone wants to make a move on me! - Who's making a move on my daughter?! - It's him! - Hold it! - Here I come! - Hold it! - Hey, let go! Ah, think if you close the door, I'll be afraid to come in and catch you? Leung Tsan, you can consider yourself unlucky to have offended this illiterate, crude, uncivilised, inhuman being. Even if there's a reason, he won't listen to your explanation. My God! You call me illiterate, crude and inhuman? Your mother! Look at you! How vulgar! Fine! From now on, I'll use the language of a scholar to talk to him. I now offer you the chance to explain yourself. For what reason did you...? Skinny! How do you say "make a move" the polite way? I don't know. Skinny? All grown up?! You look just like your dad. No kidding! If my daughter didn't look like me, would she look like you? What happened, then? He made advances on me. Right! For what reason did you make advances on my daughter? Please explain. I really didn't. Your daughter misunderstood. Actually, I was trying to catch a chicken to rejuvenate Brother Tai's body. Rejuvenate Brother Tai? Skinny, did he act immorally toward you? Then, no. Leung Tsan, apologise now. I told you to apologise! I'm sorry, Little Girl. I'm sorry, Fatty. What? You're calling me Fatty? Thinny, then. You're still mocking me?! Then what do you want me to call you? You call him God-brother... So call me Godfather. Oh! Godfather! Don't you realise you're being made a fool of? When he talks to you like that, you should do this! You sissy! Dad, forget it. Forget it? He used this gesture toward me. - He made that gesture... - Aren't you a scholar? Oh, yeah! I'm a scholar... Alright! I'm a scholar, and won't argue with an ignoramus. Skinny, we're leaving! Skinny, about those two eggs? Forget it! Don't let my dad see the feathers. Seeing this chicken tail reminds me of that fatty. Reminded of that fatty, I want to swallow him. Beating me's a small matter, insulting Brother Tai's a big deal. Brother Tai, you finish it off. I'll leave you to enjoy it. I've lost my appetite just thinking about him. Didn't hear you talk like that just then. Brother Tai, your relationship with Fatty is pretty vague. Who is he? His name's Wong Wah-Bo, he's my senior. - Ah, no wonder! - What? Senior is senior. He's stronger than you, faster than you. Even his eyes are bigger than yours. Then there's his masculinity. Brother Tai, drink the medicine, or it'll get cold. To be honest, Brother Tai, I'm not convinced by him at all. His big eyes have no soul. His big head has no mind. His fast hands have no strength. Body's shaped like a pig, horse stance like a crab. Speaking of kung fu, he's even worse than you. What? Actually, I mean your kung fu's much better than his. But there's one thing he's better at than me. - What? - His ears are very powerful. Separated by a door, he can still hear what we say. Is that so? Don't believe it. Don't believe it? Look outside. OK. Brother Tai, he really does hear everything. - So what do we do now? - Then look outside, see if he's gone. Skinny. What is it? Starting today, Dad's teaching you kung fu. Dad, didn't you say girls don't learn kung fu? That's the past, it's different now. They've been here one day, and we're without a chicken. How long before your pig's gone? Dad, you don't have to worry. I'll leave you my pig to slaughter. Nonsense! You think your dad's a butcher?! Come here. Now, first I'll teach you Single Sticky Hand. Follow my lead. Throw a punch. This move's called: Subduing Hand. Pressing Hand. Subdue me. Press. A punch. Subdue. Press. Skinny, don't be anxious. Come here. Now practice by yourself on this dummy. Punch, subdue, press. Practice by yourself. Dad's had a sudden moment of inspiration. I'm going in to compose a poem. - Skinny, good morning. - Good morning. - What are you doing? - Practicing kung fu. Practicing kung fu? - Skinny, what is this? - Single Sticky Hands. - Is that Wing Chun? - Yeah. Didn't Uncle teach you? No. I've been with him for half a year. He refuses to accept me as an apprentice, and won't teach. Then let's practice together. Come here. Follow my lead. One hand will do. Throw a punch. Are you OK? Why did you hit me on the nose? You told me to hit you. Stop just in front of my face! You didn't make that clear. Forget it. Try again. I'll chop you into 19 pieces! Dad, what are you doing with that axe? Nothing, I'm digging for sweet potatoes. - Digging for sweet potatoes... - There are no sweet potatoes here. - What are you digging for? - Think... Plant now, there will be soon! Godfather. Who's your Godfather? You told me to call you that. Why did you come over here? I came over to apologise to you. I ate your chicken last night. I made you a feather duster as a gift. My God! Do you enjoy mocking me? I didn't mean it like that. I noticed it gets real dusty here, so I'm giving you a feather duster to do some dusting. Oh, right! I feel your insides must be absolutely filthy. I'll split you in two and give them a proper clean! - Dad, don't do that! Forget it! - Don't! - Godfather, I didn't mean it. - Actually, he deserves pity. He's followed Uncle for half a year. Uncle refuses to accept him as a disciple or teach him. - Kid, let me teach you. - Great! Come... Skinny, hold this. There. Follow my lead. Ready. This move's called: Overlord Removes His Armour. This move's called: Keep Watch Over Huarong. Build Up Energy Ready for Action. When you're building up energy, you can even crack open two walnuts in your hands. Yeah, very powerful. This move's called: Fairy Scattering Flowers, or The Mountain Splits the River's Flow, whichever. Which one is it, then? It depends on your stomach at the time. Is he for real? Paper Is Expensive in Luoyang. Stick Gold on the Buddha's Face. Such martial arts, what more do you want? Great Rivers Flow to the East. Godfather, why's mine silent? Your kung fu isn't powerful enough. Keep practising. Start from scratch. Overlord Removes the Armour. Keep Watch Over Huarong. Build Up Energy Ready for Action. Fairy Scattering Flowers. Paper Is Expensive in Luoyang. Stick Gold on the Buddha's Face. Wipe it clean. Ah Tsan, come back here! Godfather, I'll come back another day. Godson, come back here! Ah Tsan, come back here! Come back here! Ah Tsan, come back here! Come back here... I'm bursting! Remember to use what I taught you. Damn Fatty, you shouldn't cheat someone like that. What do you care, ladyboy? My cheating him is still better than you hampering his progress. Hampering whose progress? Ha! He's followed you for half a year. You won't accept him and you won't teach. Isn't that hampering his progress? Talking to you is a waste of breath. I'm the idiot for talking to you! Bollocks! Brother Tai, sit. The moves I just learnt from Godfather are very good. Congratulations. You can go down the mountain. Brother Tai, you haven't taught me Wing Chun. How can I go? Even if you follow me for ten years, I won't teach you. Why? Little Brother, sit. My kung fu isn't easy to learn, and isn't easy to teach someone. Besides, once you've learnt kung fu, you'll be brave and eager to fight. A brave fighter will incur hatred. Incur the hatred of others, and you're liable to get killed. The less trouble the better. You'd better go home and learn your father's business, Little Brother. Big Brother. Sit. Now you listen! Whether they know kung fu or not, people can be brave and eager to fight. The hatred of others is often incurred in spite of oneself. Life ends sooner or later. If the people of all schools thought like you, Chinese kung fu would soon decline. You won't take me in, and I daren't force you. But, I will tell you that your way of thinking is wrong. Brother Tai, sorry for bothering you this last half year. Kid, well done! You've got guts! Thanks for teaching me that move-- A minor skill. Not worth mentioning. Whenever I take a shit, I'll think of you. So the kid knew all along. Ladyboy, did that piss you off? Ah Tsan was right to scold you. Master said taking on an apprentice is a fated relationship. You're telling me fate didn't bring you together? That's why they say, you're heartless and cold-blooded. What's that? Throwing a tantrum!? I'm sorry. Is tea to be served standing? Sorry. I spoilt the mood. To learn Wing Chun, you must first have an idea. - It's a word. - I know, it's "tolerance". It's "vengeance". Wing Chun's based on the word "vengeance". Be wilful, vicious, and merciless. I'm not as long-winded as he is. Basically, summed up in one sentence. Wing Chun doesn't know when to give up! Ah, the fat uncle's explanation is simple and clear, eh? Begin. This move's called: Two-Character Goat Clamping Stance. Begin. Raise your hands higher. Higher, higher still. That's right. You must protect a girl's important parts. Opening stance. Look at you. That's not ladylike in the least. No manners at all. You do the same as him. Two-Character Goat Clamping Stance. Now let me see you take a few steps. She looks pretty good, huh? Wing Chun's Horse stance has mental and physical strength. Waist and stance united. Force rises from the ground, fists come from the heart. Flexible turn, rapid advance. The opponent's hand is a bridge, dismount before crossing. The three segments of the bridge are at my mercy. Are you teaching me or beating me? Listen! Our Wing Chun has eight hands: Thrust, Circle, Press, Wing, Rotate, Scrape, Plough, Subdue. That right? That's right! Tradition has it, that Wing Chun's Eight Hands transmuted from the octopus. Looks the same, right? Hold out your hands. When you confront the enemy, you must seize the opportunity. The enemy doesn't move, I don't move. The enemy wants to move, I move first. Oi! If neither of you move, won't you be standing there until New Year's Eve? That's enough, you fat bastard! Respect our school's kung fu, OK? Oh, you're serious? Turning on me, too?! What if I am?! Don't go thinking you know how to turn and I don't. If you're for turning, why don't I turn, too? There! Now I'm turning! Turning gets you the back of my head! Is it supposed to be scary?! Damn it! Skinny! - Dad. - Let's go do some writing. Scared, aren't you? Scared of you? As if! The Horse stance is the key foundation in kung fu. Be sure to practice attack and defence freely, otherwise... Just like you, you'll lose your centre of gravity. Get up! Begin. The Eight Immortals' Table uses Wing Chun's Short Bridge to train rapid striking. That means, when the enemy attacks, you can't back down. You must move to unload power. Power strikes straight ahead, release on an opponent's centre. Come up. - Master! - What's the matter? Nothing. I think, among those practising martial arts, you have to be the dumbest! It's not that I'm dumb, it's that you can't teach for crap! Our Wing Chun's based on palms, elbows, shoulders. Any single part can attack and defend. Why didn't you hit me? You must remember: there's no affection in the ring. Raise your hand without mercy. Come up! My God... Not so hard! It hurts! It's breaking! Take a break. Master, why does your foot attack the lower thirds, and not the upper thirds? Why raise your foot that high? Too easy to lose your centre of gravity. It's useless. Who says raising your foot's useless? It'd be better to just admit your own legs are paralysed! Let me demonstrate for you. I thought better of it. Can't have you stealing my secrets! Ah, Uncle Fatty's always messing around. Lucky I'm learning from you and not him. You're wrong. In fact, he's the real deal. If he's willing to teach you, you can learn comprehensive Wing Chun. What's comprehensive Wing Chun? The distinction between the Long and Short Bridges. I can only teach the short bridge. He can teach you how to use both long and short bridges. Long and short, just as good. Anyway, I'll not get the chance to learn. You want to learn? What's the use? You won't let me learn from him. Not necessarily. Since I'm teaching you, I want student to surpass master. Even if you'll let me, who says he'll be willing to teach? Fatty, you're always messing around. Do you think I'm teaching Ah Tsan badly? All talk and no action, always going on about theory. Learning from you's a waste of time. You can teach better than me? Why the surprise? If Ah Tsan had followed my teaching from the start, he'd already have his own club and be taking on apprentices in the capital. Followed you? Follow a bad teacher and all you learn is how to use the toilet. Oh, so mine's really rubbish? Why don't you hand over Ah Tsan for me to teach? But that's unlikely. You're way too petty. Fatty, don't say I'm petty. I'll leave Ah Tsan to you. If you can't teach him, you must greet me as Godbrother. If my teaching's a success, what will you call me? - Godfather. - Good boy! Shut up! I can't trust anything you say. Let's swear an oath. Fine. "Siu Ming, Siu Ming, Siu Siu Ming." Call him over and we'll get started. Ah Tsan! I've been played! Enough... This dummy isn't alive. There's only you hitting it, it doesn't hit you back. Fatty, dressed up for a wedding? What's it to you? Here, wait for me to teach you something practical. Practical? Aren't you talking about theory? Are you teaching now or am I? You're teaching. When I'm teaching, you be quiet! Just looking at you hurts my eyes. Ah Tsan, we're going outside to start over. Go on. Master, so what's practical, then? That your master, that's me, veteran of a hundred battles, has the experience of being chopped up! Here. This is my combat record. Wow! Ample experience. Yeah, plentiful. Now, why did the ladyboy only learn Short Bridge? Because he's small in stature. Should he meet an opponent who's taller than him, and they fight with bridge hands, his power would be insufficient. He must strip the opponent's strength, break their stance, and make use of speed and close attack to knock the opponent down. Master, what about you? I'm bigger than the ladyboy. Therefore, I needn't worry about the opponent's build. If we fought with bridge hands, I could cross the bridge directly. Usually, tall people have heavy punches, but their speed and counters are comparatively slow. Master, then why are you so fast? How many out there are like me, your master? An elephant's build, a monkey's agility. If my two masters fought, who would win? My God! As the saying goes: "Same school and skill, stature is victorious." Would I even need to fight? I could just crush him to death! Master, what happens if I kick you? Give it a try. This is called react and release. Get up. Strike my hand. Strike again... Can't hit it, right? How'd I know you'd pull back? Next time you fight someone, will they just stand there and let you beat them? As long as the other person steps back, you won't hit them. The reason's that your fist's drop point is used to a certain distance. You must remember to focus on the target, then shift. Master, is that still Wing Chun? Never you mind what "Chun" it is. Basically, if it knocks someone down, it's kung fu! Eh, are you alright? Now I'm knocking you down! What's the use in throwing so many punches? I can endure and still be able to fight. You should attack someone's weakest points: The eyes, throat, and genitals. What if they block me? Block? Come here. Hold your arm out. No pain? Hold that arm out again. Hurts now! As long as you hit your opponent and hurt him, you can always hit at his wound. You may ask, how many punches can he take? This is called: Attacking the weak points. Come on. Eh, let's be clear. You're not allowed to hit me on this arm. Come on! It's no good, ladyboy. There's no pulse. You're touching the lacquer pillow. Of course, there's no pulse. I'm alright. - Ah Tsan. - What is it, Master? Bring me back some medicinal herbs. Oh, dear! If medicinal herbs could cure people, then ginseng and musk wouldn't be so expensive. I've never met a lead actor as stingy as you. Master's not stingy, it's just... Busybody. Poor people shouldn't be born with a rich man's ailment. Money's not a problem. Master, why don't we return to Foshan? At least it's more convenient to find medicine. Besides, I also want to see my dad and mum. Go back by yourself. I don't need your money to treat me. Do you think it'll be awkward, or are you just afraid of embarrassment? Don't die just to save face. It's not like you've been paying your own way. - Master. - Skinny. Hurry up, rub Uncle's solar plexus. Hurry up and pack. Go back to Foshan with your master for treatment. What about you, Master? After I've settled things here, I'll come find you with Skinny. Take this and put it in some water. Keep shaking until it turns the water black. Then with your hands together, call "Young Master" three times, and you will see him. Young Master... It's really that effective?! Young Master, I don't wish to disturb you, but Master said you're the ninth generation's only heir, so you must take a wife and carry on the family line. He also wants me to be his godson, taking your place in the bridal chamber. I've thought about it. All those years together, when did you ever give me a perk as good as this? But only if you agree to it in person. So what d'you say? OK? Not OK! Not OK? What now, then? I'll do it myself. Don't think I want to take advantage of you. How can you do it yourself? Come closer, I'll tell you. Closer still. Yee Tung-Choi, I'll mentally prepare you. Actually, I'm not dead yet! FOSHAN'S NUMBER ONE FIST Oh, it's the Young Lord. Are you the owners of Foshan's Number One Fist? Ah, you've really good taste. We are Foshan's Number One Fists. Don't we look the part? However, if you want to learn, you have to pay tuition first. God knows what's wrong with our luck today? Yeah. Eh, why don't we play a trick on The Prodigal Son? - How do we do that? - Follow me. You three, please wait! Who's Foshan's number one fist? I'm not quite sure. But there's one man who can beat anyone in Foshan. And I know who it is. Who? The Street Fighter, Leung Tsan. You three, please have tea. - Ah Tsan will be back soon. - Master... Young Master found a place in Chopstick Street. It's you! You've come to Foshan? - You are...? - I'm Yee Tung-Choi. In Guangzhou, you invited us Lok Fung Nin people to late supper on a pleasure boat. Then, Leung Tsan is...? My Young Master is Leung Yee-Tai's apprentice. Turns out, it's him. He didn't burn to death? No, he's alive and kicking. Then, Master Leung...? Of course, he's not dead. He's in the study now recuperating. That's great. I want to see Master Leung. Young Lord. Since Master Leung is ill, why don't we come back another day? No! I must see him now. Master Leung, someone's looking for you. Please. You guys chat at length. Master Leung, it's good to see you again. Are you joking? You're just surprised. I can't believe you're still alive. So what do you want now? When Master Leung has recovered, we can compare notes again. Compare notes? Then why don't you try hitting me now? Strike. Stop! Do you know how strong your punch is? Do you know whether I can withstand your punch? If one pulls their punches, it's impossible to determine strength. You must be as ruthless as I. Do whatever it takes to bring down your opponent. Is this what you call "comparing notes"? I'm telling you now, in the practice of martial arts, the words "compare notes" don't exist. What's more, you should have come at nightfall. More convenient for you abhorrent rats to commit arson and murder! Impudence! Who are you to speak to the son of our prince, Sengge Rinchen like that? An official? This is letting you off lightly. So I still have to thank you, then? You! Young Lord, we were behind the incident at Lok Fung Nin. But, it was at Prince Sengge Rinchen's instruction. The Prince was afraid you'd get hurt when you met a real expert. Master Leung, I had no knowledge of any of this. You Manchus do whatever you like! Ah Tsan, you can't fight them! Why?! They're imperial officials! Your entire family will be exterminated, otherwise! - Master! - Master Leung! Stay back! - Ah Tsan. - Master. This is the name for your clinic. HANG TSAI TONG (Apricot Forest Hall) Master! SPIRIT TABLET OF RESPECTED MASTER, LEUNG YEE-TAI Master Leung, I never imagined that because of me, so many of you would see harm. I've already had those two criminals put to death. I, Nifei, have no wish to be an oppressive noble. I'll estrange from my family, and search for martial artists to compare notes. When will I again encounter an expert such as you? Master Leung, I don't know what else to say. Hold it. Master, forgive this apprentice for being unable to obey your instruction. It's more than I can bear. I want to compare notes with you! Nifei, today, no matter what, I must knock you down! Leung Tsan, give me all you've got. I won't hold back. Master! Leung Tsan, you're blinded by rage. Impossible... It's impossible that I'd lose to you! I must beat you, Leung Tsan! Compare notes, eh? Leung Tsan! You're great! Like I need your praise.
