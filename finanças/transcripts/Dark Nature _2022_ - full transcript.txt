[Music] No Carmen I'm not avoiding you. Then what's been up? Nothing, I've just been, you know, I've just been a little busy, that's all. Where are you now? I'm at home. Whose home? I got to go. Let's hang out soon, okay, bye. You're early. Surprise. It's your favorite. Well almost. Souffle's got a little burned. You made dinner? Yeah. I thought we can have date night early this week. Something special. Why is my mother's silverware out? I'm being an asshole again, aren't I? Come here. I've just got a lot going on right now. I'm a bit overwhelmed. I just find it really hard to, you know? I understand. Just talk to me. [Music] Don't stop. I said I'm sorry. What? I'm just so disappointed. Well you're always so disappointed. Joy. Open the fucking door. Leave me alone. [Music] We're not early, right? Definitely not. How long has it been? A fucking decade. Joy. She's not normally like this. She's... Fucked up? Yeah. Joy what's going on? Let's go. Hi. That's Tara. Looks like you didn't sleep again. You still know the small tracks, yeah? Can we just get out of here before I change my mind. Good morning to you, too. [Music] Did you like the flowers I sent you? You didn't need to do that. Yes I did. Six months free from that asshole deserves a celebration. How about the vase? Was it hideous? Looked like something my mom would buy? It is beautiful. It was heavy. When's the last time you left your home? I don't know. Okay, you're wearing the exact same clothes that you wear when I FaceTimed you two days ago. I'm fine. All right. Whatever's up you need to get that shit in check. I said I'm fine. 20 years into this friends, I think I can tell when my friend is having a meltdown. Wherever you are you need to come out quick because this weekend is not gonna be a walk in the park. Maybe I don't need help getting over it. Maybe it just takes time. You ever think about that? Don't let Dr. Dunnley hear that shit. You guys talk about her like you're in a cult. Everybody needs help. I'm still trying to get over that shit with my jujitsu coach. I know. And that is nothing compared to what Derek did to you. I'm trying to stay open. I just, I think there's something sick about going back into your past again and again when no one really knows if that even helps. What if doing that is more traumatic? But if you face it head on you're less likely to repeat it. Yeah Freud. Maybe, but sometimes it's just enough already. We're just asking for one weekend Joy. I know. That's why I'm here. A group is annoying but Dr. Dunnley is a queen, a mind queen. So what do you think? Are you gonna try or not? Yes. Yes. I will face my trauma or whatever. That's the spirit. Okay now leave me alone. Let's go. All right. [Music] How long have you been coming on these retreats? You're new so I'll break it down. All we're gonna do this weekend is talk, talk, talk. So we're not in group, we got to go do it. Is it fun? Yes. He has this system, wears a hood. If the hood is down, talk to him. If up, leave him alone. Where did you hear that? Drive past the sign and keep driving for 20 minutes. This place is more butt fuck nowhere than usual. Ackma's have her reasons. Don't know why this retreats can't ever have running water. Watch out. Oh my god. For a second I thought ghost. Oh God he's coming over. Sorry to scare you. I'm looking for my dog. Any chance you saw it? No, sorry. The camp is just down there if you happen to need anything. That's sweet. Thank you so much. Dream the fuck on buddy. Oh my god. Oh my god. Toodle. [Music] Oh my god. Are you okay? Good. Very good. Keep listening to your body. Whatever it's saying. It's saying don't stop. Not too late to turn back. Don't be scared. It's just a release exercise. Helps get tension out of the body. That's Dr. Dunnley. A-huh. No signal. Welcome to the Stone Age baby. You can do this. He can't hurt you out here. I know. Good. This is gonna be fun. Hmm. Unless you have a problem with shitting in the woods in which case it's gonna be pretty horrible. Okay. Let's let the healing begin. That's right. He's not here. You've arrived. You must be Joy. Hi. I'm sorry you couldn't make it to orientation but I appreciated your letter. Dr. Carol Dunnley. It's nice to finally meet you Carol. Dr. Carol or Dr. Dunnley if you don't mind. Nice to meet you, too. Welcome to our group. Thanks. I just hope I can keep up. It's not easy to leave the comfort of your lives behind. But risk equals growth. Keep that in mind. We're really glad you're here. Me, too. That's where we're going? That's where we're going. That's pretty steep. By the end of the trip you'll see, you're far more capable than you ever imagined. That's what I always tell her. I want to believe you. So what's stopping you? Go. There's someone [Indiscernible]. Just one. You're out of [Indiscernible]. I don't want to leave anybody out. Alcoholic, sex addict, drugs, coke, no coke. Okay, something easier. I'm a psychopath. What's your deal? Oh you don't get to hear about my shit until you share about yours. Okay Shaina, she's new. It's all good. Okay, fine. I guess I'll go first. I used to be in the army, three tours, Afghanistan. I've been with Dr. Carol the longest and I'm the only one with a map. I'm bitter, full of rage and self-aware. Your turn. Oh Jesus. My ex was a dick. And? He attacked me. And? What is this, the trauma Olympics? Oh, you wouldn't make it past regionals. [Music] What is that? Maybe they were attacked by a bear. Right. That reminds me, heads up. Bear spray? Worst case scenario that's our best defense. Did you put that here? What do you mean? I mean, is that part of the treatment? Does it scare you? Yes. Then it's part of the treatment. Let's keep it moving. Being in nature, I felt that it would have just fixed the situation right away, right? But that's, like you said, it's all a process. I've done all the exercises. I've taken everything. I'm doing the work. I don't know what you want me to say. It's getting really hard to be there for her. But she was there for me and I don't know, I'm really angry about him. And I don't know what's best. I don't know. [Music] Hi Joy. Come on. Get moving. It's a big day. Let's show the past who's in charge. Come on. We're going that way? Yup. Is it gonna stay quiet? Nope. Hurry up. Let's move out. I'm coming. Move. Hey guys stop. Listen. Do you hear that? Why in the hell? Smells like hell. What's wrong with it? It's just natural gases. Is all the water like that? We only brought a few bottles and one filter. Oh my god, it's fine. Let's just keep going. This place is full of water. What if it's gone. There's gonna be another creek up ahead. [Music] Come on. It's a trust exercise. You got to trust me. Up. Put it up you fucker. Shaina, what are you doing? It really concerns me that you don't know that sound. I want some quiet, shh. Thanks. What do you do if you hear that noise in the forest? You do nothing, abso-fucking-lutely nothing. You know why? Because it's cougar. I really fucked that up. Careful a foot. Joy. Derek? Joy, hey. Are you okay? You didn't hear that? What? Joy. What happened? This whole thing is fucked. I can see you're angry. Do you even know where we are? Have you even been here before? Not to this exact spot, but I know these parts really well. I think it's important for us to experience something new together. This is not what I signed up for. Joy, there's no coming to consciousness without pain and discomfort. People will do anything to avoid it. What was that? Are you always comfortable not knowing where we are? Okay. If you want to go back we can go back. But if this is about something else? Why did you yell out Derek's name? If this is about him it's not gonna get better back in the city. That is why we are here. Listen, I think he might be following us. In the forest back there I heard him. Like he was right there. Joy I was right beside you. I didn't hear anything. We both know that you've been having flashbacks. So what? So is this any different? Glad I joined this support group. Joy. Joy that's not what I meant. Joy come back. Where's Tara? Tara, are you okay? Are you okay? There's someone behind me. What? He was there. Who did you see? No one. Tara who did you see? Well just a shadow Joy, it's fine. Are you sure? Yes. All right. I used to see things. I used to see him all the time. It's probably just an animal or something, I don't know. I heard something. Earlier I heard something. It feels like something or someone is watching us. Carmen was right. You're a good friend. See you at camp. Oh my god. What happened to it? It might have been dead before whatever got it got it. We shouldn't be here. It's nature. We're not here to interfere with it. We just stick to our protocols. Right. No food in the tents. We all stick together. [Music] The thing is I would prefer to die. I would. I wouldn't do anything. Joy. What happened to her? It's not really my business to tell you. It's really fucked up. Carmen, what's taking so long? No, I'm not telling you. I'm not telling you. I'm not. Come on. No, leave me alone. It's gorgeous out here. Yes it is. Keep up ladies. Come on. Just follow my lead. Come on. I don't think I want to do this. I think that's the point Joy. Let's go. Come on. [Music] Joy. [Music] It seems like you have something on your mind. Getting done laid. She needs it. Okay. Are you ready? Can I ask you something? Of course. Is this whole trip an elaborate way for you to scare the shit out of us? Do you know what my biggest fear is? What? Doing harm to my patients. I would never do that. All right. And also I can assure you that this place is safe, sacred even. People have been coming here for thousands of years. It's very special. What do you mean? Well it's my understanding the people always came here to do healing ceremonies. They believe there was a powerful spirit here. And to keep in good relation with it they made offerings. More generations than we can even imagine. Why did they stop? The only reasons I suppose, name any part of the colonial shit show. What happened to it then? To what? The spirit without the offerings? Good question. Attention everyone. We're gonna head up this mountain. There's a river on the other side. We leave in 10. We could find some flat surface to set up a camp on before dark. So get your water bottles get some water and let's get going. Hey, oh never mind. I'm sorry doctor. Hey. Hey. Will you come with me and hold the bear spray. I have to pee. I would be honored. Look, I found your giant ass cap. Okay, just hold it there, make sure it's connected. Yeah. And then you maintain a stance of superiority. Turn around. Are you sure? Turn around, I'm good. Yes. Okay fine, I'll turn around. Stop. Stop. Okay fine. Okay, here I go. Stop. Oh my god. Get out. Get lost. Go. Okay fine. Good luck. Thanks. So I just had a weird thing. Like I saw, you know, stuff from before. Yeah, okay. Can you tell me more? It won't make sense if I explain. Just, I don't want the feeling back there. And you're always saying that we should listen to how we feel. Yeah. Yeah, that's my bad. I freaked her out talking about cougars earlier. You did not. Are you afraid of the climb? What? I would be too if I had those shoes on. Shaina. Yes. Thank you. So how are you feeling now here? I like it here. A lot better than back there. [Music] Carmen. Joy, Joy, Joy, Joy look at me. Breathe, breathe, breathe. What's the matter? What's the matter? Look at me. Joy, Joy, what, what? What is it? What? What? Oh my god Joy, what? Hey. Help us. Guys help please. Tara can you get a blanket? Yup, got it. Okay, okay, okay. Breathe, breathe. Okay. We'll get you warm. It's okay sweetie. There you go. Take a breath. It's okay. It's like it was in my head. Was it a bear? It's completely natural to back slide after you've made some progress. You don't understand. This has never happened to me before. There's something out there. Something caused this. The same thing happened to Tara, I saw it. Is that true? What? It wasn't like a normal flashback. It felt like something was being pulled out of me. What was pulled out of you? Joy, listen. I know it doesn't feel like it but you can overcome this. If it has a scent it goes in the bag even toothpaste. Toothpaste, seriously? Yeah. Bears can smell it. And we didn't do this last night because? We should have. [Music] Joy where are you right now? I thought things could get better if I tried harder. How many second chances did you give him? You don't know what I did to him. I deserve to feel like shit. Joy you've made major strides here this weekend. Nostalgia is the devil man. You left him. I'm proud of you. [Music] Joy. Carmen. Joy. We were calling you. You know my dad gave me this knife. I used to go camping all the time with my parents when I was a kid. My mom hated it. Me and my dad loved going. So she'd just tag along until they got really mad one day and said that I hated family trips. And then we never went camping again. What are you guys doing out here? We couldn't sleep. Nightmares. Me, too. I had this dream. There was a man but he wasn't really a man. It was, it was this thing. All I could make out were like a bunch of... Shadows. Rotting wounds. I had the exact same dream. The thing I encountered today, I think it's causing this. Okay, we've all been talking about a lot of scary shit. Maybe you guys are just processing it. No. It's like just being here does something to us. Not me. You're not as fucked up as we are. So, what do we do? Okay, let's talk to Dunnley and Shaina first thing in the morning. Can I sleep with you guys tonight? Yeah, of course. One scout. Fuck you. Shaina. Hey, did you see Tara get up? Did you see Tara get up? Okay, thanks for your help. Wake up you vermins. We can hear you. Good morning. Good morning. Tara. Have you seen Tara? She's usually the first one up. Fuck. That fucking mall rat. There goes all our food. But there's no way Tara did this. You don't even know her. I'm sure there's another explanation. Face it. Tara's back to her old pranks again. I thought she was past all these games. Something must have triggered her. No, something is going on. We were up late last night, Carmen too. We all had the same nightmare. She was so scared she slept in our tent. So you're gassing her up. Excuse me. None of that matters right now. We have to find Tara. Well she can't have gone far. I'll go find her and we'll get to the bottom of this. Wake up people. The food is gone. The trip is over. We need to get out of here. That we agree on. I think I know where she is. I'll come with you. No, no. It's not gonna help if we bombard her. I need to speak to her for a few minutes alone. I don't think it's safe. I'll make a lot of noise. I've got my bear spray. I'll be okay. This isn't fucking good. Tara. Tara. Dr. Dunnley. Shaina, Shaina wait. We need to stick together. Slow down. Come on. Slow down. We have to stick together. Hurry up. What the hell happened here? We need to slow down and make a plan. Fuck. Dr. Dunnley. Over there. Look. Oh my god. We have to go. We have to go back. We have to get help. We have no time. It's not safe. She could be up there somewhere. Shaina, look, there's blood on the fucking rock. We can't go up there. How would you feel if it was you and that was your blood? We have to go back Shaina, we have to. Shaina. Wait. Wait. Shaina wait. Shaina come back. Shaina. Shaina. [Music] No. Let him go. Oh my god, Shaina. Where the fuck is she? Where is she? Carmen I don't see her. I saw her fall. I don't understand. Oh God. Shaina. Shaina. Joy. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh Joy. Shaina. What is that? Do you smell that? Yeah. If there is something in there we can hear it right? Not if it's hiding. It's Tara. Tara's here. Hey Tara, where are the others? He's here. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. Take her now. Wait. Joy just take her. It's fine. Go. I'm down here. Help. Hey, hey. Dunnley, can you reach me? Oh my God. Hey, I'm gonna come down. Go. Go, go, go. Carmen. Go. Go, get out. Go. Run. Don't. Let me see. Carmen. Joy. Joy. Carmen. Joy. Joy. Joy, he's behind you. Joy. Go, go. Get in the water. Get in the water. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Maybe it's giving up. No. It's bleeding us out. Oh God. I'll die here Carmen. No. No. It will wait until we come out. Until [Indiscernible]. Get the hell out of here. You're not gonna die. You won't die in a cage. No way. Anything but that. You're not gonna die. Give me some space. I'm warm. Just... Come on you fucker. Go, go, we have to go. [Music] Joy I don't think I can go much further like this. Oh god. Ready? Okay. In case we'll get out of here, there's something I want you to know. Joy this isn't what I want. Oh god. It hasn't been six months since I saw Derek. He was on my place the morning we went. What? Six months of freedom, so proud of you. XO, Carmen. I have to go soon. Where are you going? Camping. I just think that maybe we shouldn't keep working things out, you know. I don't think so. Last night shouldn't have happened. Well you seemed happy. You invite me in. No, I didn't invite you in. You showed up at my door crying and I thought you just wanted to talk. And then, and... Joy. Joy. How long have you been fucking lying to me about seeing him? I haven't lied. I wasn't. It wasn't like I was seeing him. It was just, he kept calling, and calling, calling. I saw you block his fucking call Joy. I did. He kept showing up and begging to talk to me. He feels so bad, it's killing him. And he just wanted me to hug him. I don't know. I don't know. I still love him. He killed your dog Joy. Okay, you know what I have a confession of my own. This was your last change Joy. I told myself I would not stay in a friendship where I care about your wellbeing more than you do. It's too fucking painful. How can you say that? I just, I just really want to go home. It's okay. [Music] Carmen. Joy. Joy. Joy help. Joy. Joy, no. Joy. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm so sorry. [Music] [Music] [Music] You still have those pain killers We're not going to my place. We're going to the hospital. If he's still there you have to know. [Music] [Music]
