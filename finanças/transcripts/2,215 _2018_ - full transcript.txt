BANG SAPHAN HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM ONE Put Toon on. The other room wants Toon on. This song makes me feel so alive. I want all Thai people to love each other. During starless nights I will still walk on Love is the light that guides me On nights that I am lost My dream is my best friend on this path I still have a goal To reach the last light - Hey! - Hey! 28 AUGUST 2017 Where is the sign? It's behind there. I see. - It used to be easier to spot, right? - Yes. - It used to be at the bridge, right? - That's right. - The building wasn't here then. - I see. I haven't been here in ages. It has certainly been over 20 years. I think I was in high school, or maybe primary school, on a holiday with my family. NORTHERNMOST POINT IN THAILAND MAE SAI, CHIANG RAI When you first told me you were coming here, Oat, I didn't even want to come. I didn't want to see it yet. I'm the type of person that doesn't want to see the ending. I wanted to see it the way I planned it. So I thought, "Well, I won't get off, then. Yes. I'll come later." - It's 4:15 a.m. - Toon Bodyslam, rock legend, is here with... ...the Kao Kon La Kao Charity Run for 11 hospitals in Thailand... ...covering a distance of 2,191 kilometers... He has a 55-day plan to run... ...from Betong, Yala... ...to Mae Sai, Chiang Rai. Runners, get ready. Starting Kao Kon La Kao in three, two, one! Raise your hand if you're too tired. Like this, okay? Yes. 2 WEEKS BEFORE RUNNING - He needs to stop. - Stop. - Thank you. - Get ready. Keep running, just keep running. - Don't stop yet. - Slowly now. Do 20 more steps. Breathe in slowly. Toon, when the machine stops, you need to get on the bed. Lay on your left like always. I've done a lot of things this past month to prepare for this. I ran every Saturday, went on a concert tour, shot some ads, went abroad, and also went to do other things. Before flying down to Betong, I was working up until the last few days. I flew here on the 29th, I was working until the night of the 27th. Seems like we won't get it. - Shall we try again tomorrow? - Okay. It's so hot. My body's pale, but my arms... It's like I'm two people in one. And I haven't even started to run yet. - I have double standards, see. - Okay. I understand he's not a professional runner, and he has a lot of things to do. But to actually run 50 kilometers a day... DR. PRIYANANT CHARUCHINDA (TAEW) Usually, he only runs about 20 kilometers a day. Aiming for 50 kilometers, it's not certain he will be able to do it. But he always says, "I'm ready. I'm prepared." It takes years of training to build up the muscles of a runner. To run 2,000 kilometers, an athlete would have to build endurance, strength, and flexibility. It takes years to prepare. Years, not just a year. DR. SAMITTA SANKHABODHI (MAY) But this is really short. It's like he dreamed of it and now he's doing it. Kao Kon La Kao was founded on the belief of the crew... CHAICHAN BAIMONGKOL (BELL) ...and all of the Thai population. Toon said he wanted 700 million baht. "From where?" we asked. He said it was an ideal number. As if the 70 million Thai people were to give him 10 baht each. It's really challenging to just organize a run from Betong to Mae Sai. Nobody can do that. Speaking plainly, it's a game. It's Mr. Athiwara Khongmalai's game. TEERATAT SANGKHATHAT NA AYUDHYA (OAT) The condition he imposed was a time frame of 55 days to get from Betong to Mae Sai. So it was up to me to put together a team to get him to last those 55 days. Each day, we would be running at least 50 kilometers, which would be divided into five sets of ten kilometers, with a 40-minute to an hour's rest between each set. This is to let to muscles rest before running again. One concern was muscle disintegration. What happens is the muscles break up, causing some substances to leak out from them, which can lead to kidney failure. Another concern was heatstroke. If the body becomes dehydrated from increased temperature in the core, it's extremely dangerous. The third concern was insufficient blood flow to the heart. If he's running and suddenly his heart doesn't get enough blood, that would also be an emergency. The worst case scenario that may happen? Actually, nobody wanted to take on this project. I didn't want to. No doctor wanted to. SATHIK THANATAK (PENG) Because the worst case is, he dies. It's the 1st of November. It's 4:47 a.m. right now. So... this is the first day of my run from Betong to Chiang Rai. I'm pretty excited. Push the button on the car. I went to bed at around half past 10:00, and woke up around 4:08 a.m. I think. I think I'm ready. The 1st of November, I'll be the most focused. KAO KON LA KAO BETONG, YALA SOUTHERNMOST POINT IN THAILAND I'm waiting for Toon. - Who? - Toon Bodyslam. Okay. - Hi. - Thank you. This way, too. Toon. Thank you, everyone, for coming out to help the Kao Kon La Kao initiative. It's blurry. Just a little bit from you, 10 baht, 20 baht... - Use another camera. - ...whatever you can spare to give to 11 hospitals all over Thailand. I spent a couple of days making this. I believe this will bring a smile to people's faces, - the fact that a little bit of power... - Keep trying. ...from each of us supporting this will combine to make something great. Keep going. Mom, he's here! KEEP GOING Toon. - Mom, hurry! - Cool! Thank you so much, thank you. Thank you very much. I'm waiting for Thailand's superstar. How does his song go? That's by Labanoon. I can't sing, I don't know Thai. Before, I liked him just as a normal singer. His songs are great. But now I like him even more. I like him the most. This is why everybody is waiting to see him. Now, there's no one who doesn't like Toon. I love him, I love him a lot. Come out, then. Toon is about to get here. Hurry up or you will miss him. Toon's here. Toon, Koy, good luck! - Keep going. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Toon is almost here. Come out. - Really! - Wait a second. I'm not lying. Come out to the street. - This way, please. - Cute. Thank you. - Thank you. - So cute. Stay in school, okay? - I saw Toon. - We finally met again. I'm almost 60, but I call him my older brother. He can be my older brother. It's the second day of running. Please stop. There were so many people. I'm really touched by the locals, the little kids, who cheered me on along the way. It's wonderful. It's memorable and worth stopping there awhile. Give me your hands, guys. Amazing! - Hands. - Keep going. Toon is gone. Amazing, I got to touch his hand! That's great. - His hand smells so nice. - I want to smell it. - Yes. - Yes. Today is the fourth day. The second set was long but I'm really happy. It took about three hours, but I feel so good. People were smiling. Let's donate. - Get a group picture. - Wow, Manchester United. Thank you. - Okay. - Dad, give him something. Are you interested in switching to Spurs? Okay. He's off. What sentence in the southern dialect do you want to teach him? Come eat at my home. Hey! Come sleep at my home. You can't say that, it's not proper. Less than a kilometer away now. - Toon is about to come. - What's up with Toon? When he comes, you start singing. - I count to three and you sing, okay? - Okay, let's shake. Pretend Toon's here. One, two, three. In life you have to find your dreams Louder! -No matter how many times you fall -I can't hear you. - You have to sing louder. - Who is doing that? When Toon comes, he will take a picture with us. - Really? - Yes. Sing and he will take a photo with us. Let's sing our hearts out. - One. - No. - Don't step out. - Two. Three. In life you have to find Your dreams No matter how many times you fall Take a picture with me. - That's it. My throat hurts. - Keep going, Toon. It hurts. While we're working hard... - Some coffee, Pol? - Sure. Come on. That was quick. Oh, no! - Sorry. - It's okay. It's my fault. Are you hurt? Hey, it's okay. - Tisshy, please? - I'm tough. - Tissue. - That's your joke? Thank you. - Some joy milk? - Soy milk. - Can I have some mega, please? - It's Maggi. This is nice, too. - Who corrected my pun? Thanks. - Around here. Em, did you do it? - Well... - It was you, right? Thank you so much. This set was fine, right? - Go direct the traffic. - Thank you. Only 200 more of these. More. - It's cool. - It's cool. There are two people working on my legs right now, Bowie and Aof. And there are Em and Pol. Why are you shooting so much, Em? That hurts. Is that a message? This is my message to Em. Can I film while you're peeing into a cup? You want to? This will turn into another kind of movie. It won't be a documentary about running anymore. Right. I won't say if I'm scared of dying. I don't think about it. If we use that as an excuse when we set out to do something or not, then that venture won't get the most of our energy. It's not worth worrying over. When you get to do a once-in-a-lifetime thing like this run, for example, you can't worry about death like that. We're part of the medical teams that Toon is raising funds for, so in return, we wanted to do something for him, even if it's just to cheer him on. But we're happy to be waiting here in the rain. That was a formal answer. Now a more personal one? Yes, be personal. - Personally. - How do I feel? - Personally. - Oh, I see. Actually, I want a selfie with Toon, but there are a lot of policemen. Go, Toon, go! And if Toon runs past here and he stops here, what would you say to him? - Keep going, Toon, we're rooting for you. - Too formal. Be personal. - Oh, I see. - Be personal. Toon, please take a picture with me. Yes. Toon. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Keep going. - Keep going. - Mayday. - There's a traffic jam. Thank you so much. One photo, please. - Thank you very much. - Be safe. - Good luck. - Don't approach him yet. Sorry, I took so long. There were so many people along the way. - Take a picture for me. - I'm late. I'm late. Take a picture for me. - Amazing, you have an iPhone. - Yes. Amazing. Smile. Big smile now. - Give me a big smile. - Okay. - I love you so much. - I love you, too. - Take care of your health. - Thank you. Good luck to you. - Thank you. - Be careful there. - My eyes are closed. - I'm content now. It was worth it. Worth it. I'm so happy. Don't cry. What? I'm glad, so glad. She's happy. Tell him I'm so happy. - Toon! - Toon! - Toon! - Toon! Toon! This is amazing. How are you? Didn't need to follow at all. Really good. - Let's run together. - You start. Let's run together, come on. Come forward. - Come on. - Come to the front, Kob. Hello. - Just a second. - Go. Hello. - Sing his songs. - How many kilometers has it been? Toon. Writing songs for Toon comes from two things, watching him and guessing what's on his mind. It's about being able to work together. In the end... KAJORNDEJ PHROMRAKSA (KOB) ...he doesn't even need to tell me what to write. It just comes. It's like we can embody each other now. Every night after Toon finishes a show, what I see is him sitting shirtless, eating grilled pork here. But just now, he met thousands of people. Though, the moment he comes home, he just turns into a normal guy. Sometimes he's cheerful, sometimes he's quiet. On his quiet days, I know exactly what he has gone through. Thousands of people throwing themselves at him, it's like a crashing wave and he's facing it alone on this beach, this stage. Screams can drive you mad if you don't know how to handle them. It's like that saying, "Alone in a room full of people. There's something missing in my heart." But all those people, the screams, his success, they never filled his heart up, never. To be successful yet feel alone, how do you get past that? How was he going to get past that? In the end, there were other things in life that made him feel like they were just as important as singing. Before, his life... was all about the music. But when he discovered running, it took him to another world, a new way of challenging himself. So he made another mountain for himself, the mountain of running. Now that there are many mountains, he can choose to not just focus on one challenge. I think Toon has found what truly makes him happy. Do you know what it is? It's the happiness of giving and not hoping for anything in return. It's not about standing on top of the hill of success. His happiness is... just giving people joy, energizing them. - Amazing. - Kob, super. Where did you come from? I don't recognize you. - Can you see? - I thought you were a pimp. - I was scared they wouldn't let me in. - So chill. I was scared they will think we're pimps by the roadside. You're okay? - Good. - He was looking so tired, but when he saw you... Surprise. - He's reborn. - This always happens. - I think it's good. - Methi, he was like, "You have to go. You have to." - So dramatic. - True. Have you formed a team? Where does it hurt the most? Here. - Crying is normal now. - I guess it hurts everywhere now. Yes, if you press on it. - Your shoes? - But it hurts the most here. - Your guts are telling you that... - They left. You can do it, right? Yes, I think I can do it. Oat wants everybody out. Bye. Get some rest, Toon. I'm going down now. Let me just change my pants. Have you eaten? KAO KON LA KAO Runners, ready. Three, two, one, go. - Hurry up. - It just started. Toon, your hand please, your hand! Traffic is a little bad. People want to see Toon. Who's that? Who? Please don't push. Please let Toon have some breathing space. Toon! Toon! Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Toon's the kind of guy who treats everybody well. He really cares about people. I asked him, "Toon, when you run, why don't you run past the kids, the old people, the guitars, everything? To make a better time?" He said, "I can't. If I ran past them without saying hello, I would remember it, that I ran past this old person and I didn't stop, or I ran past this kid and I didn't stop. I would feel guilty." Toon. A round of applause for Toon. Go far. No selfies with Toon, please. But you can still take a picture. Take your own selfie when he runs past, okay? - Just a second. - Okay. I don't think you need to warn them. You okay? Oat, be careful. You go first, Oat. Get out of there, Oat. Move along. A hundred crew members can't hold them. They cared enough to come out. We want other people to care for us, but we... I think since we're out here, we have to do whatever we can. Yes. Don't come out if you're not ready. Yes. If we're not ready then we have to stay home. Greetings, teachers and elders, and all the students who... All the students. One, two, one, two, three One, two, one, two, one Kao Kon La Kao, go, Toon! Yeah. Thank you. Now, we will give this to Toon. Let's take a picture. Hello, everyone. Make some space in the middle. One big shot for the students. Come on. Get up and go. Don't swarm all over him. Look at the camera. Two schools tomorrow, right? One in the morning, one in the evening. - Can we set up in time? - Yes. Do it on stage if there's a stage. There was a stage yesterday, but was it hard to set up? - Because... - It's not, but when you get down... - It's better on stage. - No. Otherwise, the kids can't see. But it will be hard for you to get down. Is that okay? - Sure, that won't be a problem. - Okay. Sure thing. - That's good. - On the ground... The kids can't see. They're trying to take pictures, - and they're so small. - Okay. You win. No. - Wait. - This is work. I used the wrong word and you like to... Jeez... I would kick you if I could. I'm not trying to win. This is work. - You're getting worked up. - Since the other day... - Right, Oat? - This is about work. "You win," what's that? - I said the wrong thing. - I'm already stressed about running. - What should I have said? - And now you're saying I'm trying to win. I can use the word noted. Like, "noted." - Okay? - No, it's... Okay, it's better. Okay. "You win" sounds like I'm... Like you must bow to me. - It's not like that. - It's not. He doesn't like it when I say, "You win." I've said it to him twice. My "You win" means okay, I'll do it. But to him it means... - he's being stubborn. - Which he's not? - He feels like he's stubborn. - And is he? - What? - Is he stubborn? Em's recording. Is he stubborn? Why is it hard? - What? - Is he stubborn? If stubbornness was a three-speed fan, - Okay. - Which speed is he? Which one is the highest? If there were three speeds, I think he's at 20. Really? He's so damned stubborn. - Yes. - So stubborn. Please take a picture with us. Send the picture. Here we go. Please, this is my mom. - Don't crowd in. - Smile. - Let me take a picture. - Smile, Mom. - Here it is. - Dad. - Look up, Dad. - Dad, look. Please move a bit. Thank you. - I haven't got a picture yet. - Please share the pictures. Sorry. Me, too. Picture, please. At first, Oat said there were six, seven kilometers. I was secretly happy. But they were the most crowded six kilometers, the longest selfie line, I had seen. This way, too. Hey, where did he go? - Run. - Okay. An hour passed and we had done just 2.5 kilometers. - When I got down, my back was hurting. - Right. Do you have anything for support? I think this way. - Then what? - Then this way. And now this way. - So, everywhere? - Yes. And here. If I don't bend down, then it's okay. But whenever I turn around it hurts. This is for support. It's like a brace for your back. - Not yet. - Okay. Oh, gosh! Make some space, please. A hug, please. Runners to the left. Runners to the left. Please let the traffic move. Runners to the left. Toon has signaled for two rows, so as to not disturb others on the street. Please don't cut each other off. Two rows, please. Please let us clear the way. Hurry up. Be careful. Everybody, veer to the left. To the other runners, veer to the left or right. Hey, can I leave this with you? Oh, gosh. Did you make good time on this set? - There's no order. - There's no order? - There's no order. - Right. The runners, they keep going forward. Right. I always tell them not to. They just keep running, and... Hey. There's no order, May. - No, this is... - I saw it. - Sorry. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I'm sorry, Pol. - It's okay. - He's worse than usual. - Does it hurt a lot? Today, he seems... It's messy. He seems disappointed, too. It's messy. So messy. KAO KON LA KAO Leave some space. - Leave space. - Don't go there. Sixteen kilometers of torture. Left ankle. - Left ankle? - Left ankle. - Does it hurt? - Yes, like... - Is it a searing pain or an ache or what? - It is... Hey. - Check yourself. - Okay. - How are you? - I can continue. - How's your leg? - Okay. - I saw you limping. - It's just one spot. The old one? No, the left one. - New one? - This one's new. Do you want to do just three? Three sets today? Can you do it or not? I have to keep going. It's inflamed, - How is it? - And there's swelling. It's been like this for a few days, - but he didn't tell me. - I did. He only said, - I didn't have the chance... - Don't say I was silent. - I always said it hurt. - You didn't have time for me. I always told you. - You did. - But where's the time? - That face. - Who's wrong? Oat's wrong. - I'll kick you. - Come on. - Oh, gosh! - I always told you. I told you what's hurting. - Kick? - Don't say that I didn't tell you. - Can you kick Oat twice? - I'll take it. - Just go to sleep. - Don't say I didn't tell you. You can donate the money. Please let them run. Give the money to people in the back. Toon! Please let them run. Give the money to the back. When he's going at a certain speed then he turns, - Don't cut off the line. - Goes in a different direction... Let me. Big issue. I don't know. He's not limping yet. Oh, see? His knees seem... Let them run. - Thank you. - Thank you. Veer to the right. I need to stop. - It's okay. - Does this side hurt, too? Here? No, the leg... I misunderstood. All good? All done? How many kilometers left, Tor? - Four. - There's four left. - Four, Toon. - That's a lot. Walk, okay? I'll try lightly jogging. Are you okay, Toon? Need a doctor? - Yes, get a doctor. - Be careful. Get a doctor. Go. Not okay. Do we need an ambulance? He was okay just now. Sorry, no more pictures. Sorry. - No more pictures, please. - Excuse me. - Can you stand up? - I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. - It's okay, Toon. - It's okay. - It's all right. - It's okay. Toon, it's fine. It's okay. You did great. You were amazing. Be strong. It hurts, okay. We'll have to wait and see. Toon's day is worth a lot. He was getting three, four hours of sleep. We needed his muscles to recover as much as possible. There is a technique to relax the muscles that have been overused or inflamed by using a small needle to poke the muscle knots. This loosens those tight knots. And when that happens, the muscles can be used again immediately. That hurts! Enough. Can we stop? No. One, two, three, four, five. - It hurts. - Six. Let me wipe it up. Rest. - Five more and we're done. - No more, please. - It hurts so bad. - Okay. I'll stop and pack up now. It fell out, what a shame. Come on, let's go. We're done. - Going? - Yes. We're done, as I promised. Fuck. It hurts? DO NOT DISTURB V1 IS RESTING - Two for help, please. - Two? Can you hear me or are you asleep? Pol, are you dead? No. Okay, then go wake Toon up. And get the therapist. Are you sure you want me to wake him up? Hey, are you sure you want me to wake him up? I'm too scared. - Go. - You do it. - Wake Toon up. - You do it. Idiot. I'm too scared to do it. You do it. Me, again. Aren't we doing it together? Toon? It's 4:10 p.m. - Toon? - Yes? The cars over there. They can all move to the back. - You okay? - Yes. - Did you sleep well, Toon? - What? - I want to sleep more. - He slept like it was nighttime. Slept well, too. He wants this. - Should we stand by? - I could only worry. Toon didn't realize that he would be hurting less or hurting more at all. He only knew that... he had to refresh, reboot himself. Get himself ready for the next set. That's all. - Ready to fight? - Of course! He's not hurting. Take a picture with me. Keep going, Toon. Grow up big and strong. Go, Toon, go. THE PEOPLE OF BANG SAPHAN WELCOMES AND THANKS TOON Athiwara Khongmalai Remember his name, Thai people KEEP RUNNING, TOON YOU DON'T HAVE TO STOP DON'T FEEL GUILTY WE'RE GLAD TO BE HERE TOON IS WAY BETTER THAN VIDEO GAMES WE ALMOST FAILED AT SCHOOL, BUT WORKED HARD FOR TOON Step by step Come, come, Thai people -Send Toon your love -Send Toon your love - You sing well. - Toon Bodyslam -Toon Bodyslam -Toon Bodyslam Toon! -Toon Bodyslam -Toon Bodyslam Keep going. Go, Toon, go. Go, Toon, go. Praew, he's here! Praew. Hello. - You're here. - How are you? How have you been? - Do you feel better now? - Yes. Do you feel better now? How are you? - Hello. - Hello. - I saw Toon! - I found you. - Look into this camera, please. - Smile for the camera. - One more. - Let's do this. - Do this. - Smile. - I met... - Hello. Praew and her mother after running for Bang Saphan. Have you donated? - Have you? - Yes. And now on to Toon Bodyslam. He ran to buy medical equipment... DECEMBER 2016 ...for Bang Saphan Hospital. He ran 400 kilometers over a course of ten days... FIRST STEP BANGKOK-BANG SAPHAN ...from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan. - And he exceeded his goal. - Yes. The total amount of money raised was 63 million baht. FUNDS RAISED FOR BANG SAPHAN HOSPITAL Thank you! After running, I went to Bang Saphan. The doctors gave me a tour. They showed me what has been done with the money we raised, and they took me to meet Praew and her mother. SITMANEE KOOMRAKSA ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY Praew was her school's runner. She was an athlete. One day, she was running across the street and she didn't see a trailer truck coming. DR. PONGSAK THITIDAMRONG (ED) She got hit by the trailer truck, which ran over both her legs. The bones in her legs were crushed to pieces, and her muscles, tendons, blood vessels, and nerves suffered severe injuries. I saw my legs and didn't think I would make it. I was depressed. I didn't want to live anymore. We performed a surgery to hold the bones in place, using standard equipment that the hospital had. But a problem that followed was the big wounds from both her thighs to her ankles weren't covered by muscle or skin. If left like that there was a chance of infection which could lead to amputation. We had to do everything to cover the wounds as soon as possible. And we didn't have this equipment in our province, so we used the money from Toon's fund-raising to buy it. It was a great help, otherwise, I don't know how the wounds would be now. They probably wouldn't have healed. Try standing up. That's it. Can you do it? Almost. I was so happy, because what we've helped achieve was taking shape. I was just so happy. In the alley, you can visit me. Thank you. Bye now. Next time we meet, you have to stand, okay? Promise? Promise me. - Promise him. - Promise? - Yes. - Promise. Keep trying. Seeing this, hearing about these things, it makes me feel like I should be doing something. Of course, it's not completely solving the system's problems, and it's not the completely correct way to do it, but is there a way that's 100% right? While we're arguing, there are people who are awaiting treatment, awaiting some equipment. If I can get just one more piece, it saves another life or maybe two. I think that's better than doing nothing and just arguing. If it's not hurting anyone, we should do it. #KAOKONLAKAO DONATED BY THE PEOPLE VIA MCOT After running 400 kilometers from Bangkok to Bang Saphan, it created an image for Toon, of a man who makes sacrifices, who runs to help hospitals. At the end of the year, on the news, they were showing the turnover of central hospitals around the country and they were suffering losses. The headline was "Toon, help us!" TOON, HELP US! But I didn't think he would take it seriously. MASJID SILAHUDDIN DONATION FOR KAO KON LA KAO PROJECT TOTAL DISTANCE TOON'S RUN SHEDS LIGHT ON THAI SOCIETY IT'S NOT TOON'S JOB YET HE'S DOING IT HE'S JUST RUNNING TO LOOK GOOD WHY IS TOON BEING CRITICIZED?

It smells so nice. 1000 KM At the next stop, when you reach the finish line, please get into the van. It will take you to the parachute spot. What? Parachute? This sign says, "We took this money to the sky for Toon." We want to see Thai people fly. Thai people can fly today and this money was flown in for the Kao Kon La Kao run. No matter how tired he is, he truly did it for the greater good. Please give a massive thank you to Toon! - Hip, hip! - Hooray! - Hip, hip! - Hooray! - Hip, hip! - Hooray! We love good people We love Toon Bodyslam Go, Toon, go. Go, Toon, go. - Thank you. - Yes. Many people think of me as a hero. I don't think I am one and I didn't set out to be one. I don't even dare to think about it. The true heroes, as I always say, aren't on stage here. The heroes are at the hospital, wearing white. The true heroes are standing in white behind me. Make some noise for them. - Go, doctors, go nurses! - Go, doctors, go nurses! - Go, doctors, go nurses! - Go, doctors, go nurses! YOU GIVE THIS WORLD HOPE KEEP GOING, TOON, DOCTORS, AND NURSES KEEP GOING, TOON WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE PATIENTS Thank you so much. I just want to say that I'm not good of a person. Hey, Toon. I remind myself I'm me when I start feeling kind of overwhelmed. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING HAPPINESS BACK TO THAI PEOPLE If they give something to me, I want to give them something in return. Everybody that showed up, they're the special ones, the real heroes. They all helped. It's not my money, it is theirs that is making this happen. I'm just an outsider, saying that you can help here, here, and here. So, I'm not the hero. They need to know they're the heroes. I keep saying this. I don't want to be a hero. I don't... I don't like it. I don't... - Toon? - Yes? - You have to come to take some photos. - Okay. - Hello. - Hello. - Thank you. - Thank you for helping the hospital. Thank you. - Thank you. - Yes. Keep left. Make way, please. This man loves his country, and he has done all that he can to help. Please, make some noise one more time for our hero. Treating Toon like he's perfect is really dangerous. When he makes a mistake, he feels it a hundred times more. Come run with me. Come on. Keep going. They say, "This is what a good person does." What I'm saying is that in the end, everybody has different sides to them, including Toon. He's just a normal guy with love, lust, and anger. Maybe he feels things even more strongly than most people sometimes. His muscles have been through a lot and they haven't had time to rest. Today's the second day of rest. It's actually the 5th of December, I'm supposed to be running, but they wanted me to rest for another day, because something in my blood is worrying them. It's a little too high. Yes. So, I plan to stay inside all day, sleep as much as I can, do some physical therapy, and get a saline drip. There was a time when I thought maybe it would be cool to make a movie. Wait, let me think of how to say it. It's about a singer who's really famous. He can't walk down the street or have noodles by the roadside. He can't go to the mall, he can't have the life that everyone else has. This isn't about me. It's a movie. And he wants to live a free life. He wants to go wherever he wants, eat whatever he wants. Where is he? So, he goes to a temple and makes a wish, not really taking it seriously, but when he wakes up the next day, his wish had come true. Like, damn. It's real. Nobody says hi. Nobody wants a picture with him. Like, he's really happy. So, on that day, he goes to a roadside stall, the type of place he always wanted to go, but never got to. He goes to the beach, to theme parks, stuff like that. And it's good, he's really happy. But after a while, this life bores him. He wants to get his old life back, the one in which he gets to sing. So, what to do now? How to do it? Back then, where did it start? Oh, it started with music competitions. But he's too old for those now. He goes on singing shows, but gets bumped off. He knows what the steps are. He knows, he has done it all, but he can't do that now. In the end, well, I don't know how it ends. I think he should be successful in another way. Maybe he becomes a singer in a bar who's really happy. He's loved, has a good family. Maybe that's it. That could be the end. Amazing, I got goosebumps. Why... Like, sometimes... that's all we want. To be happy, to be... loved. I don't think there was a specific moment that made me who I am. It's just a mixture of my upbringing, my way of life, or maybe even genetics. Is there anything to eat, Mom? - There are some fried donuts. - Toon. - There's porridge. - And? I don't feel like eating rice, Mom. - No rice. - I want to eat bread. - Here. - Thank you. Okay. Here, try this. - No. - Just a bite. - It's good. - Try one bite. No, I'm eating this. Come on, just one bite, darling. - Enough. - Oh, darling. - Believe me, darling. - No, thank you. - Pick that up. - He's so stubborn. Toon, do you want noodles? I had it packed for you. Noodles with braised pork. Why don't you have it at the school? I'll go get it. You can choose to have it or not. As a boy, when I fed him, he would go... I went this way, he would go that way. If I went that way, he would go this way. Always dodging. Oh, gosh. I didn't know... I didn't know how to make him eat. He just wouldn't. As a boy, Toon was really hard to take care of. He was always crying. He cried all the time, like, wow. Was he trying to expand his lungs or something? He cried without reason. - Okay. - Thank you. - I love you. - Yes. Cut that grunt out. KINGDAO, CARTOON, KAITOK AS CHILDREN Toon, Cartoon. Hey there. Why are you being shy? Are you pooping? What? I'm looking. What are you doing? - I'm looking. - Looking at what? Toon, Cartoon. Hey there. What are you playing? Well? What are you playing? Hello. One, two, three, four. Back by popular demand, it's the Kik Kok Band. Today is the 17th of May, the year is 1987. Master Cartoon will be singing. Come on. It's cool, it's cool We can go out if you like I don't care about much I don't want to disturb anyone It's cool, it's cool If we were to go steady Go steady I only want love and honesty Nothing else It's cool, it's cool The end. Now it's your turn, Dad. - Now? - Are you starting? Mine must be "So in Love." Your eyes are talking If you pity me, don't lie to me Who do you love? Don't worry about me, don't lie to me Even if it kills me I'm ready to die For you I can go through anything CARTOON'S VOICE POPULAR THAI SONGS Let him make the best of today. We shouldn't expect anything about how he will turn out. - The end. - Not yet. He can be whatever he wants. He's him. My job is just... to support him until the end. What he becomes, that's his business. If you're shy, just go in there. We raised our kids like everybody else. Look. We didn't think his heart would turn out to be this big. I always worry about this and that. Can his body take it? Will his kidney fail? I didn't think good things. I was too worried. My concern made me think of negative thoughts all the time. But I can't treat him as if he's a little kid, right? He's already 38, far past the age where I can boss him around. I know Toon likes to jump. He jumps on everything on stage. But it's not like I can say, "Toon, don't jump," right? "Toon, don't jump, just stand and sing normally." I said it a hundred times. Did he ever listen? "Toon, don't jump, it's dangerous. Don't go up so high." Things like that, I can't say those things to him. "Toon, don't headbang so much," I once said. But did he listen? If he wants to headbang, he will headbang. I think Toon's competitive. He wants to achieve whatever goal he has set, whether it's about singing or something else. POONSAK JATURABUL (OAF) Say we have a really high-pitched song. If I asked if he wanted to take the key down, which would make it easier, he would say, "No, let's try this." And he will try until he does it, until his throat is busted. But he won't change the key. This belief comes from stubbornness. If you succeed, it's called belief. If you fail, it's called stubbornness. But it's basically the same fuel. Toon has always been stubborn about staying on his path. But after he got so successful, it became a belief. And he has passed on this power of stubbornness to new generations. It's a way of affirming his identity, his choice. Life is about pursuing our dreams Life is about pursuing our dreams WAT PHRA SRI ARN SCHOOL Make some noise for the kids of Thung Maha! Thank you. - Super. - Toon. So great. - He's here. - Yes. Peud! Peud, calm down! He's so happy. Don't cry. How was it? How do you feel? Amazing. I just met him. First time? - Tell me how you feel. - How do you feel? So lucky. It's our first time playing with a superstar. It was awesome. His performance was so good. Man, this guy, I really like him. Work out, okay? - So touching. - Really. I'm just so happy. The things I sing about, the things I say, the things I think about, I use myself as a point of reference. I didn't have the ability to help anyone, at first. When I was starting out, singing, I was following my dreams and that took a lot of energy, right? I didn't have enough left over to share. But in the end, the things I did for myself, either the songs I wrote to cheer myself up or whatever, it traveled further than I thought. It gave people hope and it's... It's... What word should I use? It's not profit, it's beautiful. Yes, it's beautiful that other people received the same strength. Let's go. Team One, ready when you are. OPERATION IN PROGRESS - Keep going, Toon! - Keep going, Toon! You're almost there. Toon. Two thousand. - We've hit 2,000. Hooray! - Hooray! That cheer was for the number on the Garmin car reaching 2,000 kilometers. One more time. Right, please open your eyes a bit more. One, two, three. I don't know what to say. For the remaining 200 kilometers, I hope you all enjoy the work. Please keep faith. And thank you all again. If I've been too stressed or too tense, I would like to apologize for it now. Thank you all. I wish you happiness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Toon gave us serious power. I'm fully awake now. It's his voice. Thank you. They just asked me, "id?" Am I "id?" - What's "id?" - We leave at 10:40 a.m. They said "id" means tired. Where I come from, "id" means eat. Where do you come from? Where do you think "id" means eat? You have to know. Do you know? I'm not "id." I'm sore. What's sore? This is the sound of pleasure coming from our runner, because the doctor hit the sweet spot. Do it one more time. We must give him what he likes because he has been through so much. Go! Zoom in to his face. That's a smile of satisfaction. The distance he has run was all for this kind of repayment. This is his prize. Give it to him. Good. - Not sore? - No. Not sore. Who's sore? That's a lie. - One more time. - Today, for pineapples, we recommend Phu Lae. Are we at Phu Lae yet? No, Phu Lae is in Chiang Rai. - What about Nok Lae? - What? Nok Lae is a parrot. With a sweet voice. - Why didn't you continue? - It's a boy. Yes. - A baby? - Poo. - He uses... - Pol's here. - We'll go to the back. - Come here. - This is the last set. Get ready. - Come on. - Let's take a picture of this moment. - The album owner. One, two, three. Here. Hurry up. This is the last set. There's no more. - See you around. - Hey. -No more, -Why did you say it like that? There's no more. I'm not doing it anymore. - No more. - Oh, gosh. - Northeast. - No. - Don't start yet. - No more. - Let's finish this one first. - Thank you. - Yes. - Thank you so much. Thank you very much. No more. Even if there's one more, I don't want Em again. Yes. He shoots all day. It's his job. Five, four, three, two, one. Go! I told him he was crazy. When he was up there, taking pictures, he said, "See, Mom? A crazy guy can do it." And he's good. This camera, please. The big one. This way. This way, too. - Stay awake. - Don't fall asleep yet. Stay awake. Thank you. Thailand Records would like to present you with this certificate for being the first Thai person to run from Betong to Mae Sai using an internationally recognized method of measuring distance. We present you with this certificate now. I remember the second Toon got that certificate on stage in Mae Sai. He pumped his fist like this. I never saw that before. I was wondering what he would do when he reached the finish line. Would he slide on the floor like a football player or something like that? Would he shout or put his face to the ground and cry or whatever? What did he do? He just pumped his fist, like, "I did it." Like he just softly kicked a ball into a goal. He didn't think what he did was amazing. But his heart is so big, and he did it. His "I can do it" is very powerful. "I can do it", for him alone, means, "I can run. I can do it." But when you expand it, his "I can do it" means, everyone can do it. If you could talk to yourself in the future, what would you say? You mean if that day comes when I've reached this place? I would probably say... "What you did was good." Something like that. Yes. I would say to that guy... "Congratulations." It's not a relief, because if you feel relief, that means it's a load off your chest. But it's still here. I think we all feel that it hasn't gone anywhere. There's a mass that connects us all. There's a structure in our hearts and it won't ever go away. 2215 KM KAO KON LA KAO DEDICATED FOR ALL SELF-SACRIFICING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS KAO KON LA KAO CHARITY RUN FOR 11 HOSPITALS IN THAILAND RAISED OVER 1 BILLION 413 MILLION BAHT BY 31 MAY 2018 KEEP GOING, TOON WE LOVE YOU BLIND RUNNER KAO KON LA KAO BETONG - MAE SAI TOTAL DISTANCE EQUALS 2,397,824 STEPS 86 DISTRICTS, OVER 2 MOUNTAINS 10 RIVERS, 291 CANALS, 1 LAKE EARLIEST START 2:15 A.M.
