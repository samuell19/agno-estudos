Waaji city is called as the capital of dark empire and it is situated far away from India and very closer to the crime world. That city is now being reigned by Roy, the chief of the Roy Group. 20 years ago, Roy lost his entire family in a gang war. He left Bombay, the former name of Mumbai and arrived at Waaji city. Roy joined the gang of yesteryear's Godfather Prithviraj in that city. After Prithviraj's reign, his throne and his authority were passed to Roy by bypassing his son Devaraj. Roy group was immensely thriving with imports, exports, gold and oil mafia... ...but there was fallout from within and the reason was Karana village. Though Franco Maslin, the close associate of Prithviraj, tried to control the issue into getting bigger, Roy had come up with a proposal to his board members to ensure that this doesn't repeat in the future. And that proposal is to legitimize their business The place they have chosen to do that was India. When they thought they had found the solution, the problem arrived in the form if Indian Central Minister, Mr Ramaswamy Aallagadda. There is neither any place for such criminals in my government's reign, nor would let them be. -[pierces] Ouch!-We function according to... ...rules and regulations, not according to the organisations. Sorry gangsters, hope I made my point clear. Devaraj, it's very difficult to impede Ramaswamy. The Roy Group of Industries has been given the opportunity by the Indian Government to start its work on the renewable energy and hydroelectrical power project that they had pitched for in 2016. Moreover, the Indian government will extend complete support and I assure the same in a written statement as the Central Power Minister. -Regards, -Ramaswamy Aallagadda. Actually, we have kidnapped your signature, but not you. You can leave it on that document and leave. [door opens] This hand has stopped several corrupted people. But they is one more The repercussions of kidnapping a Central Minister... Do you have any idea about it? When men from my department shoot gangsters like you like rabid dogs, and drag your corpses... [door creaks opens] Come in. [running footsteps] Hmm... Thank you. This is for you. Take it. Bye, Grandpa. They might think this to be a kidnap if you are the only person missing. So, I brought your entire family here. They will consider it as a vacation. Roy is not a cheap person. The entire world knows that he wouldn't touch families. And what do I have to threaten me with? Ah! [glass shatters] [groaning in pain] [groans] If I had to threaten you, I would have done that in India and made you sign on the document. But I wanted to get this work done by instigating fear. And from now on, everything would be dealt in the same way. Sign the document. Sanskrit verse: Sthitaprajnasya ka bhasa samadhisthasya keshava Sthitadhih kim prabhaseta kimasita vrajeta kim. The system which has declined us will now, have to bow its head and work for us. Do you think they can stop us? Everyone: No! Cheers! [applause] Roy is going to India after a very long time. Even our ship that contains money, will touch Indian waters in a few hours. [ship honks] [airplane whirring] Tell me. I am not sure. I would have told you if it was Bombay. But now, this is Mumbai. Driver, what's this route? Ballard Pier route, sir. We're at Ballard Pier route and we'll reach within 5 minutes. [collision] [groans] [groans] [screeching] [explosion] [traffic] We need not specially tell you about the robber, who we are going to discuss about. [siren wails] He robbed two thousand crore rupees in just two robberies. Who is the robber? Why are they robbing? What's their next target? We don't even have a single clue for these questions. We should be ashamed of ourselves. -Sir -Yes Three teams from the special task are working on this case, sir. We have beefed up the CCTV surveillance and tracking all the unusual activities. We'll nab that robber within next 24 hours, sir. -[everyone tapping] -Sir. A third robbery took place, sir. What? Shouts: A third robbery took place, sir. Huh? What's this? Heard that we didn't find a single clue? Goswami. -Goswami! -Sir. Clue! Not just clue, but also all the robbers who were involved in this heist were caught. But...[indistinct siren wails] But... Those people who were caught claim they weren't aware that they were involved in this heist, sir. What? [yawns] He seems like some higher official. Sir... Sir... I want to talk to you, sir. Private talk. Okay. -Hey... -Stop. Allow him, Ajay. Thank you. Tell me. Whatever I've told these policemen, I will tell the same to you, sir. Explain me how am I involved in a robbery. Generally, people would wake up in the morning with the crow of the rooster. But I wake up to the sounds of the TV serials. When I was already frustrated with the high electricity bill, [door bell dings] some guy outside was annoyingly ringing my doorbell. Hey! Who the hell are you? An arrow whooshed and stuck onto my door. Did 'Naazuku Naagini' TV serial start at your house? TV: Shoot Naagini... Shoot me. Yes... Well... There is a gun in the basket in front of you. Have a look. If you immediately fire the gun into the air, I will pay your electricity bill for this month. As he was right about everything including the name of the serial, I believed that he would pay my electricity bill. [gunshot] Sir, I'll continue the narration from that part. I boarded my van at the time which I do it every morning, and was offering prayer to Lord Ganesh, I saw a letter. Upon hearing a gunshot, if you drive your van to Turner Road in Bandra West and park it, I'll pay you 20,000 rupees. Huh! Some stupid guy! Huh! Money! [gunshot] [birds flap] Ah! [gasp] Who... are you? John Snow. I know nothing. Wait here. I opened the invitation card out of excitement to see who was getting married, but to my surprise, it was an intimidation invitation for me. Hey, keep calm, pack every item in the locker room and keep it ready. If you don't obey, just have a look to your right. If this goes haywire, the bomb in the suitcase would explode and we'll ensure that the woman of your family place bouquets on your corpses. Your time starts now. [balloon bursts] [door opens] [balloon bursts] [balloon bursts] If you give an angry stare at the manager of the shop, you'll get Rayban sunglasses along with the suit and the suitcase for free. [grunts] [scoffs] Oh no! [whimpers] Fast and ferocious delivery service. Give us the bags. Come on, quick. [balloon bursts] Last balloon. Go to the place where you came from. [whistles] [gunshot] Hey... Hey... Didn't you tell us that you weren't aware of the van? But why did you fire the gun exactly at the time when the van arrived? I fired the gun not because the van arrived, sir. Then? I've fired the gun because of what was written on the rear side of that note. If you fire the gun one more time when the end credits... ...of 'Naazuku Naagini' TV serial begin, I will permanently block the channel that telecasts that serial. [gunshot] [noise] Stop! You're the last guy remaining. -Tell me properly. -Sir... Sir... Hmm... Swami... Did you see the car driver? No, sir. Did you see the registration number of the car, at least? No, sir. What about the colour of the car? No, sir. Why do you say you saw nothing? Are you blind? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. He is blind. He is a blind guy. [honks] Are you blind? Car... [car revvs] He was told that he would get him eyesight if he does the given task, sir. I've checked and there's an eye-surgery scheduled at Apollo hospital at 4 pm. [phone rings] Mr Shinde... We've just started investigation of this case, sir. All the 30 members are here. Just give me a week's time. I didn't call you to know that, Shinde. It is to inform you that this case will now... ...be taken over by an undercover police officer. Who is he, sir? He is Ashok Chakravarthy. These are his details. Even if we guys create fake documents of ours, I don't think we'll have these many records and medals. But, will he able to nab the robber? Let me tell you about him as I've got experience working with him. His entire life is off the record. What do you mean? [rainfall] Sir, here is the photo of Alex, which you've asked for. He got trapped at the gangster Mani while dealing illegal guns. He's like a smoking advertisement that comes before a feel good-movie. Though the content is correct, the visual would be very disturbing, sir. [car engine revving] [tyres screech] We used to do business individually and had incurred a huge loss. But now, all the thugs in the entire state got united because of you. Hail Lord Ganesh! Hail Lord Ganesh! Father-in-law, shall I start? Bro, Alex is leaving us with money even while dying! [chortles] [clinks] He'll certainly be alive. I place my jeep as my bet. What man? Which state did you come from? A dry state. Hey, how dare you place a bet against Mani? Kichidi will be ready after 5 whistles. Superb, sister-in-law. It takes just 5 whistles, for Kichidi to get cooked and for him to get knocked out. Come on, try. Come on... Let's see. [pressure cooker whistles] One [bottle shatters] [cleaver swishes] He'll be finished today! I don't think so. [earthen pots shatter] Hey, get him. Go and close the gate. -[yells]-Bro... Bro... Please rescue me. These guys will kill me, bro. Please, bro... [pressure cooker whistles] Hey... Let him go... Ow! Hey, careful... [pressure cooker whistles] What are you doing here like a scent amongst these pigs, dear? What? What are you doing? I'm drying clothes. Are you drying clothes when it is raining? What's with your romance in this extreme violence? Hey... Hey... Someone, go and disturb him. [clangs] [groans] Oh man! [laughs] That rascal fell down! He just fell, but didn't lose. [groans] [snake hisses] Py... Python! [groans] [snake hisses] Why is a python here? [knocking on the door] [shatters] [yells] Bro, we don't need mutton today. He entered room number: 9211. [pressure cooker whistles] Alex... Winner winner, chicken dinner. [chain clinks] [indistinct animal grunts] [panther growls] Why the hell do you have panther over here, douchebags! [metal door creaks] Bro, that scoundrel escaped to upstais. [whistles] [shatters] I'm done with cardio. Let me try lifting weights. The 5 fives whistles are over. That's it! Hey, finish him off. Bro... Please save me... They are dropping me. [lever unlocks] [chokes] This ain't the game of snakes and ladders, to climb up easily. Now that, you have come up... I'm giving you two options. Either you cut him loose or jump down from here. [pulley creaking] Hey, what the hell are you doing? Hey, Samba... Samba... Let him come down... I'll handle him. Hey, move aside guys! Hey... Come... Come... Bro... -Your death is my hands!-Mani You've lost. No, father-in-law. I didn't lose. -I will certainly kill him today.-Mani... He has hit you with his strength until now. But now, he's hitting you with your fear. Everyone over here knows about this, except you. I'm telling you from my experience... Don't meddle with him. Let go. [sickle clangs] Who the hell is he? You've risked your life and saved mine. What do you want from me, bro? Information. Roy group dreams of establishing a power base in India. It has fallen back because of Roy's death. What will be the fate of Roy Group now? The world still believes that the entire family of Roy was killed in an attack that took 25 years ago. But by hiding from the same world, Roy had brought up his son somewhere far away. Everything alright? [foreign language] [speaks in foreign language] His name is Vishwak. Where is he now? [alarm wails] [helicopter thumping] He's our security head. We have to suspect everyone after Roy's death. Then, what's he still doing here. [screams] I want to meet all the board members. Arrange for the meeting. [door creaks] Tea, sir. [clears throat] Tea, sir. -Here... -Go. Go... Hurry up. Move. I don't understand why this meeting is arranged in a public place. Ah! Sir, I'm new. But both of you had the history of working together. Start the discussion. Actually, you are right. -Ashok, the robbery... -Franky speaking, I was called... ...because you're idiots. Why do you again include me with you? I am solo type. Amritha Nair. Goswami. Sir. Did you see the glittering eyes of this girl? Her neck... Her haircut. Out of all, I can see her perseverance to nab the robber. How can you see all those qualities in such a small photo? This girl is okay for me. Sir? I meant I'm ready to work with her team. Ah... Where is she? She's handling Lal Bungalow's case. [camera clicks] I've filed the case as gang war as you said. Sign here and I'll send the corpses to the autopsy, sir. It is not a gang war. They're shot by just one guy. Look the fallen position of the corpses and bullet spots. Everyone got shot at the same place. Exactly in their hearts. Yeah. There seems to be a pattern. The pattern is fine but we need proof that there was a fourth guy. Solid copper bullets. Handmade. The gun he used was a Glock 25. We can nab the 4th guy if we trace the missing gun. Give us more information, madam. If you observe the shooting range, it infers that the killer is a short guy. And moreover he should be... -...a professional because... -And moreover... he entered from that door, shot them and escaped from that window. It's wrong! He didn't come to deliver a courier so that he could ring the doorbell and enter. He's here to commit murder. He's right. He sure must be a higher official. Sir, please come in. Sir, please... They say 'ladies first', but don't give a damn to it! Move! Madam, please...[footsteps running] Whoa! [makes whooshing sound] [train honks] What's this effect, sir? It is the background score for this mood. Sir? Sir! The train left, and we're left with the case. -Look Goswami -Sir... In a way there is a reason behind every crime, there is a story behind every criminal. The story behind this case here is It was just one guy who fired but it's not as simple as you think. [gun cocks] [train running] He pulled out his gun and posed a question at the same time. One of those guys got alerted upon seeing that and the other guy felt tensed. [gunshot] [screams] After that, he asked him about the third guy. He will come in sometime. [gunshot] [screams] The third guy arrived an hour after his death. [indistinct train moving] [gunshot] That guy has finished off everyone! R.I.P Removed In Piece. Where is the appreciation guys? You are superb, guys! [applause] Sir Oh, sir! Sir. Everything is under control, sir. It will be solved. Hmm... Sir, -I wanted to talk to you about this case -Amritha... -Ajay will handle this case from now. -Thank you, sir. I'm sorry, sir. You shift me to another case every time, at the last minute. Won't you let me solve the case completely, at least once? All the best for the next one. Ashok... Now, I want you to crack this one very quickly. Sure, sir. Get your old brains and come to my new office at 10 am sharp... It doesn't matter if you're a bit late. [market sound] Did it come? No, sir. What about now? No, sir. [sighs] [noise] Ha ha... It has come. Welcome, Amritha. What is this, Goswami? This is the newly designed office for our special mission. That's our discussion area. That's sit-out area. -That's our night out area and that's... -Stop it. -I understood. -What did you understand? There is more of useless work rather than actual work, in here. [gun shots] How can you forget the shooting area, Goswami? How could you forget that, Goswami? Everything that you see here isn't true. If at all if there are any genuine things, you can't see them, Amritha Ji [clock chimes] Huh! Goswami, get me a beer. Sir, how can you think of having beer in the morning? Why are you stretching your mouth wide open for that? Can't we have beers during off duty? -Moreover, I hail from... -Dry state, isn't it? You might be parched. [tumbles] [shatters] Give me two minutes. We got all the CCTV footage related to the TRP Jewellery robbery. Which camera do you want me to play? Play all the cameras. Check all footage please. Need to find the robber. Iâ€™ve got my eyes on camera 1, 2 and 6. Preethi, check the rest. Got it. Yes! Whoa! There are no games for girls in here. Go. [machine blips] That's the footage which we've already checked. We've identified every face that we saw on CCTV footage and interrogated them. No use. So, you are looking for a face that wasn't found in the footage. The robber might have covered her face. I mean... covered his face. Sir... Would someone who stole crores of rupees, sport a cap or a burka or a sweater? -Ow! -That's a goal. But still, it is a cheap logic. Huh? [ball knocked and rolls] Yeah, he might be sporting them. He might be having a budget issue. [machine blips] Hey, search all men wearing burkas and women carrying handkerchiefs. Okay, sir? There are several guys sporting caps and handkerchiefs. There are several people with their faces covered. What do you want us to do? Why would his dressing style be ordinary when his robbery style was extraordinary? There might be a design or a pattern... or a watch might match a shoe... Something like that. Sir. You'll slap me when I question but... Try matching something. Match shoes and cap colours in all cameras. Look at camera number 5. There's a match! There is a guy whose cap colour matches his shoe colour. Finish the game. Play. Ah... there. Hold it. -Preeti, zoom in. -Zooming, sir. Pause it... Pause it. We've got him. We've got him! [phone ringing continously] I have seen what you sent the details. They are very impressive... And also, I've sent you our next plan details too. Let me know about it. [air whizzing] [speaking in foreign language] -Jaja, listen to...-No, Ibrahim Ji. Is our money safe or not? I understand all your fears. Roy's son will come and transfer all the money within three weeks. What does he know about this organisation? Devaraj, son of Prithviraj, is the only rightful heir of that chair. That's not just a chair for someone to ascend on it! It's an authority! And Roy's son is the only person who has that authority. [laughs] We don't even know if he was really born to Roy or someone else. How can such authority be given to him? What do you mean? I mean, do you know whether he is legitimate or a... [voice muted] [electricity buzzes] [door opens] You have unnecessarily opened your mouth. Now, I will open up your body in such a way that even if all the cobblers in the city come together they wouldn't be able to stitch it back. Is your tailor still stitching your sleeves half and inch longer? Either you change your tailor Karim or stop sporting a suit. It doesn't suit you well You don't know about me but I know about each one of you very well. In fact, I'm the only person who knows where the two trillion is. I think this is enough for me to ascend that chair. I've got two tasks left before I ascend this. To start Roy's vision, in the way he wanted to and to bring out those who are responsible for Roy's death and kill them. What happened in the meeting? Huh... We shall talk about it later. There is nothing left to talk about it later, Mr. Devaraj. It's impossible for you to ascend that chair when Roy's son is alive. He seems to be tougher than Roy. He made everyone shut their mouth upon his arrival. And Prince stood like a statue watching him talk! [laughs] And we've almost died laughing. What do you say, Mr Prithviraj? [laughs] When Roy was alive, everyone was hailing him. And after his death, it's his son who everyone is hailing. Are you laughing about it, father? [spoon clinks] [chokes] They don't know, father... ...that I could kill and bury them here for laughing like that. But you know about me, don't you? You shouldn't laugh. They don't know, father... ...that it was me who made you confined to a wheelchair for denying me that chair. But you know about me, don't you? You shouldn't laugh. They don't know, father... ...that it was me who even killed Roy like a dog to seize that chair. [gun shot] Roy's two trillion are lying in the lockers of mine and Prince you know about it, don't you? You shouldn't laugh. [panting] Don't worry, father. I won't kill you until you see me ascend that chair. Prince, greet Roy's son on my behalf. All clear. We are moving out. John, stop! [explosion] [gun fire] [groans] [gun fire] Die, you bloody! [gun fire] [gun fire] [gun cocks] Hey! I'll kill you! -I'll kill you! -Come... Hey, let me go... I'll kill him... I'll kill him... -Listen to me. Have you gone mad? -Look, listen to me... -Hey... First... First... First, cool down! Cool down! Look, think like Roy. Look, think like Roy's son. Well done, Ashok! I didn't expect you to track in a very short time. At least, we got to know how the robber looks like. So, what's your next move? -Sir, we are planning... -Sir... You have to look at this. Play this one. Preethi, just open that one, please. Why is he always holding a Viktor coffee cup in his hand? You are exactly right, sir. So, if we immediately log into the servers of all the Viktor coffee shops, we may find him. It's a waste of time. There's no guarantee that he would come there. But there's no guarantee that he wouldn't come either. [phone rings] Hmm... Hmm... We've got a lot of artists in our office. Don't touch my belongings. [bottle tumbles] [things clutter] Ma'am, do you want any help? No need. I can take care of it. Ammu... How come you ended up in the police department despite being beautiful? What's your story? He asked her the very question that irritates her. I have no such stories. There has to be. Look at his face. His parents were scared of his robber-like looks. So, they got him a police uniform and pushed him into the department. And the other guy likes a crook. I don't have such stories. Let me know if you know anything. I'll listen. Your attire from top to bottom are of light colours and less jewellery. Your shoes have more polish than your fingernails do. Receiving no phone calls or messages since morning infer that... ...you talk to few people. And you trust fewer. So, why did you choose this department? As you are afraid to face society on your own, you are hiding behind the mask of the police. Instead of coming out of your emotional weakness, you've built a wall around you. It is like... the way you stop your tears despite you feel like crying. Goswami, you have to be very careful with him. Preethi, zoom camera 2. Zoom in... Zoom in... Go back. Back... Back... Back... Back. Stop! Sir! This coffee shop is right next to us, sir. Letâ€™s get him. Get the tracker. Gate B, 3rd floor, guys! David, stay here. [tyres screech] Stop the car. I think they got some lead, sir. [phone rings] I know that place. It's an event called ARMANI. Hello? Who are you? Excuse me. We are from Mumbai Crime Branch. -Tell me, sir. -Where is the 2nd floor CCTV footage? -Show it. -Sure, sir. A... R... M... A... [indistinct people chatter] Preethi, check the CCTV. Yes, ma'am. Let the game begin. Entrance camera... He must have left. Ma'am, the server over here is down. Not just here, sir. All the CCTV servers in the mall are down. As far as I know, he didn't come here. Ashok Cappuccino for Ashok. Table number 3, right? Someone has ordered coffee for you. Armani... What could his next plan be? Are you thinking how would we get the money when the ship was sunk? Hmm... Take right. Only Ibrahim and I know about this building. It is the most secured building in Waaji. [screen blips] There is more money in here, than what we lost. [screen blips] Please insert the Black Box. There is only one key that can open this... that is Black Box. But that's not here. Then, where is it? After Roy died, we had to hide the Black Box in a safe place in Mumbai. So, I will go and get it. No! If you were with Roy on that day, Roy would have been with Viswak today. You should stay with Vishwak. I'll go. This is the event which is happening after a long time in the city. That is why we have to talk to the organisers and get the complete surveillance under our control. Once we spot him, we shouldn't let him loose. -Okay? -Sure, ma'am. I think we are very close to solving it. The boy kissed the girl. And they lived happily together ever after. Do you find my words funny? What would your reaction be if he is in front of you? Reaction? I will put him behind bars. Hmm... We know he did all those robberies. But do we at least a single evidence to prove that? Tsk... Tsk... Tsk... We don't sir. Then, what do we do? Sometimes, we nab a criminal before he commits a crime and sometimes, after he does. But... But in our case, we have to catch him in the act. Right. So, we have to follow the robber like a robber and know his plan. Right. We have to follow that plan and nab him. Right... Are you tempting? Uhuh! [clock chimes] But I'm feeling it. -Goswami! -Sir. We're going to a pub tomorrow. -Tell her not to wear a wedding dress. -You told her, sir. [club music] Just keep a check on all the CCTV cameras. Okay, sir. I will take care of it. Something is missing in my life, Goswami. What do you lack? You've got robbers to catch and people like us to play with. -Huh -What else do you want? That is what. Violence... There is too much violence. -You know something... -Romance? Yeah. I want romance. [door opens] Please come in, ma'am. Oh man! The wedding dress would have been better. Sir! Don't you think the dress is quite a bit? It has to be this way. Otherwise, they'll know that we're police. [machine beeps] [clears throat] [machine blips] Sir, we need to check. [machine blips] Wait... [machine beeps] Not only just dress, but you should also be wary about the placement of badge. When did you take it? Sir, something important I need to talk to you... Ouch! [crowd cheering] "I'm yours... I'm yours... I'm yours... I'm totally yours" "I'm yours... I'm yours... I'm yours... I'm totally yours" "See the stars in the morning, in the sky" "My eyes are sleepless seeing your beauty" "Drown me in your intoxication. Don't be shy" "This is how our hearts will wake up... Wake up" "You mesmerize me with your eyes when you face me" "You take me with you and make me high" "How did you steal my heart with your touch, oh firefly?" "Come, let's go out for a tea" "Oh, my lover..." "You are my romantic lover" "My heart melts when you look at me... Beware of it, my heart! Beware..." "My lover won't wait anymore. He's a cracko..." "My lover won't wait anymore. He's a cracko..." "I'm yours... I'm yours... I'm yours... I'm totally yours" "I'm yours... I'm yours... I'm yours... I'm totally yours" "You've shown an enchantment with your words that spins my head upside down" "You've shown an intoxication with your words that spins my head upside down" "What's the hurry? Lets take it slow" "in this real dream" "Oh, my lover... I'm ready for you..." "I have set bait for you long ago and I won't leave you" "Write down our story..." "My lover won't wait anymore. He's a cracko..." "My lover won't wait anymore. He's a cracko..." "My lover won't wait anymore. He's a cracko..." [people cheering] Despite knowing how important this mission is... How could you behave so carelessly Amritha? Damn! You have brought this mission back to zero. We lost him again! Who said we lost him? I met him after that. Steve... one whisky on the rocks, with a slice of lime. -Stir it up and make it fast. -Sure, sir. I want the same. Sure. Shouldn't I booze? Hmm... Booze as much as you can! It's a free country, brother! What say! -Thank you, Steve -Enjoy, sir What do you do? It's a secret. What about you? It is a top-secret. But never mind. I will tell you. I am a thief. You made a mistake. You've confessed to a police. Whoa! He is interesting. After that? What happened after that? After that, he boozed a lot and talked about many things. You must have heard of the Waaji city. There is an important locker there. The device that can open that locker... the Black Box... is here in Mumbai. I am planning to steal it. Once I get the Black Box, I will be a freaking billionaire! I will be a freaking billionaire, man! Black Box? [lighter clicks] -Did he say Black box? -Yes, sir. [lighter clicks] This is my favourite lighter. It's an antique. Can I see it? It would only have looked more beautiful if I had its missing part. There is a reason for talking to you privately. Roy Group... It is the worldâ€™s most powerful crime syndicate. These are not their criminal records. These are details of the people who wanted to stop their crimes. [scoffs] There wasn't any use. But... the Black Box that you are talking about... if we could get hold of it... then, we can stop the Roy Group from coming to India. He gave us a bigtime information in inebriation. No. He knows about me very well. That is why he told me. He threw a challenge to catch him. But what he doesn't know is that I will spare no one. No one! [footsteps] Ashok... Do you genuinely have any use of me, in this case? Because you've already have answers to all the questions. But this time, it is just the answers that I have. You have to find out what the question is. You are in my team, Amritha. If anyone has to yell at you, it should be me. Not someone else. He should take his words back. These are the flights coming from Waaji. Passengers list? There you go. Shortlist the business class. Total 20 passengers. If we remove 5 female passengers from the list, then we are left with 15. Wait! I just need the list of the five female passengers. That's it. [airplane whizzing] [tyres screeching] Her name is Kalki. She has a law degree from Stanford and a Doctorate from Oxford. She is currently the Chief Economic Advisor for the Waaji government. After her father, Gopala Chary's death, she became the legal advisor for the Roy Group. [namaz] [namaz] Praise the Lord! Amritha... update me everything. Guys, solid jam. [honking in the traffic] [bike engine revving] [tyres screeching] [bike engine revving] [gun fire] Madam, are you okay? Don't worry, madam. It's a bulletproof car. [gun fire] [gun fire] [chaos] Ashok, there is an attack happening here. Amritha, just stay in the car. [gun fire] Ashok, I think they've come for the black box. I have to go. Amritha, no! Wait. [gun fire] [phone ringing] Hello... Hello... I've been... I've been attacked. I know. They can't harm you as long as I am there. [gun fire] [groans] [gun fire] [groans] [indistinct voices] [bike engines revving] Guys... Something big is happening. [shot fired] [machine gun fire] Amritha, it's very dangerous. Don't go. -Please, don't go... -Damn! [chaos] [gun fire] [gun fire] [gun fire] [bike engine revving] [gun fire] [gun fire] [gun fire] [glass shattering] [glass shattering] [groans] [bike engine revving] [gun fire] [thud] [vehicle arriving] [glass shatters] Traffic is getting cleared. Shall I go to the airport? No. Now, the entire world knows the information which was known only to us. [fighting sound] [glass shatters] We should put that Black Box in a safe place. Where? [glass shatters] [groans] [gun fire] Driver, move... -Madam, get in... -Come on. -Come on. -Make it fast. [car honks] Missed? What do you mean you've missed? Sir, seems like they've missed it again. -What else can we expect from Amritha? -Mr. Ajay. [metal door creaks] Who said we missed her? I've attached a tracker while the car was leaving. Move... Move... [tracker beeping] Later, the car didn't stop anywhere and passed through Haji Ali, Grand Road, Cotton Exchange and it finally stopped in Ballard Pier. In front of the Capital bank. [camera captures] So, it's in Capital bank. No, sir. [camera captures] Alright, back to the office. No. I think we should follow Kalki. -How can I help you, madam? -No, thank you. What is she doing at the pharmacy? From there we've followed her again. The Black Box is not in the Capital bank, but itâ€™s in the Royal bank, behind that medical shop. [vault creaks] How will the thief come to the bank if he doesnâ€™t know about this? How will we catch him? He is a thief, but not a cop to know it late. He will always be ahead of us. Well done, Amritha. Sorry, I take back my words. Are you going to make me walk till the office? Where is the car? You've been going good till now. Why are you so upset suddenly? When I was young, one day, my mother was learning to drive and drove the car quite fast. Even though my father, who was sitting next to her was tensed, I was screaming for her to go faster from the back seat. Suddenly the car hit the divider and rolled over. It was a complete blackout. When I opened my eyes, I saw blood everywhere. My parents were staring at me without saying a word. My life which was passing happily till then, turned upside down. I'm happy after several days. I am scared that I might lose this happiness too. You were right about me, Ashok. I don't have anyone with me to share my happiness or sadness, except my shadow. Now you donâ€™t even have your shadow. But I'm there with you. [cicadas critter] Even I don't have anyone... ...just like you. "I'll be with you like your breath, no matter where you are" "Loneliness will not haunt you anymore" "I'll be fine in any danger, if you are with me" "I'll accompany you in long journeys" "I hid myself in you" "I'll love you in a way that you'd forget the past" "I'll be before you till your eyes get tired" "Let my silence of all these years disappear for you" "I'm lucky that I'm with you" "I dedicate everything that's mine to you" "We will never be far apart if I have your help" "I hid myself in you" "I'll love you in a way that you'd forget the past" "I'll be before you till your eyes get tired" "I'll be watching you even if my eyes closed" "I'll hide you in my heart always" "I'll love you in a way that you'd forget the past" "I'll be before you till your eyes get tired" [cicadas critter] Show me your hand. Will you tell me my future? It's not yours but ours. Beautiful. I think itâ€™s costly. I sold such a big car and it fetched me this small ring. [scoffs] This small ring is equivalent to so much love. [clock chimes] What happened? You are asking me to lead the entire team. Won't I be tensed? Everything will be okay, Ammu. [thunders rumbling] [screen blipping] [screen blipping] I brought everything you asked me including bank blueprints, security system details and the police control data of that area. There... That's where the main entrance is. It is not as easy as they think to enter this bank. That area control rooms will be alerted, if they try to open the main door. After you cross that, you'd find a CCTV camera at every foot of that place. And then the high voltage electricity laser tags. And finally the locker. The vault. It's impossible to open this vault. That is why, we will make it possible for him. What do you mean? Here, we need the thief and also the Black Box which he wants to steal. So we have to think oppositely. Whatever he expected should never happen, no matter what. So, we will provide him entry to the locker room. Upon realising there's nothing inside, he'll understand that we have already acquired the Black Box. Am I right, sir? Off the record, the case will be closed. That Black box is very important to us. Guys... Take this [thunders rumbling] These watches are for the emergency. Just press this button, if there is any problem. [thunders rumbling] Shinde, what happened in the market shouldnâ€™t repeat again. I haven't seen such a sharp police officer in my career. There is no chance of missing it. If he misses, my next warning will be at gunpoint, but not on the phone. -What's his name? -He is Ashok Chakravarty. Ashok Chakravarty. [cicadas critter] Guys, look. Damn! Stay alert. Something is surely on. Wait for my command. [door creaks open] [watch blipping] Amritha, look. Damn! [police siren] Guys, you can't escape. Surrender! You've got no option. Don't do anything stupid. Ashok, two down. But neither of them is a robber. I'll handle it. Damn! Everything is gone. [guns cocking] [gun fire] [bullet clacking] Hey David! You got that damn money! -Damn! -Stop. [groans] Bloody! Stop, stop. [tyres screeching] [tyres screeching] -Hey... Hey... -Stop. Get down! [gun fire] [gun fire] Ashok, he has escaped. -He is heading towards Silicon. -Go for plan B. Okay. [police siren] [glass shatters] [traffic] [phone ringing] -Hello. -Sir, there is no Black Box here. How come it is not there? Sir, not just the Black Box but the entire bank is empty. -The bank is empty?-Yes, sir. I'm coming there. [tyres screeching] [tyres screeching] [glass shatters] Happy birthday to you... [phone ringing] -Hello. -Stop... Stop... Hello, sir. Sir, there is a problem. Tell me. Where? [dialer tone ringing] Ashok, its time to end the game which you've started. [shutter rolled up] [phone ringing] -Hello, sir. -Send a backup team immediately. Your guys are about to catch an undercover police officer. Under cover officer? Who is he? What do you mean? He is undercover officer Ashok Chakravarthy. But sir, Ashok has been working with us, right from the very beginning. What? If he is Ashok Chakravarthy then who is the thief? [car engine revving] It's show time. [tyres screech] [tyres screeching] [car engine revving] [rim screeching] [collision] [tyres screeching] [thud] [thud] [transformer explodes] Goswami, let's go from the other side. We should catch him by all means this time. Block the bridge. [tyres screeching] [rim screeching] [collision] [tyres screeching] [tyres screeching] Faster... [tyres screeching] [car engine revving] [tyres screeching] [thud] [tyres screeching] [car engine revving] [gun shots] [groans] [panting] [groans] Amritha, stop. [gun shot] You are shooting the wrong guy. This is the real Ashok Chakravarty The undercover officer 'Whatever you see here aren't true' And even if they are, you can't see them, Amritha Ji. 'How can we nab him?' He is a robber, but not a police like us to realise it lately. Thanks, Ashok. Saaho. My name is Saaho. [thunders rumbling] Do you know how you came into this world? You came out lacerating your mother's womb, with the umbilical cord around your neck and blood on you. I am asking you to move forward just like that. Hit them and get in the car, or else die fighting. What? Do you want more? What happened? Someone stole the Black Box from the bank. So, a thief came into the police department, made you believe he was a policeman and made the police steal. When someone could easily hack the police department database, what were our police hackers doing? He was our hacker but he was working for him. David. He gave you the video from the jewellery shop CCTV I was investigating and... We got him. ...made everyone believe I was the thief. [gun shots] He gave me the original footage of him going there... You know that place. It's an event called Armani. And made me come to Armani. He was the one who told me about the Black Box. -Black. -Box. -I will be a... -...billionaire. Whatever he wanted, he made it seem like I wanted it and whatever he wanted to do, he made it seem like I was going to do it. He made me come to the bank along with David. [police siren] Later, he designed the whole game plan of where I will go missing and where I will be found. To put in simple words, he used your name 'Ashok Chakravarthy', more than you could ever use. Get some rest. You need it. [machine blipping] [footsteps leaving] Do you know how costly is your mistake? Sir, I couldn't anticipate him. Look around once. You wouldn't have anticipated it as well. Sir, give me 48 hours. I'll find him. [clock ticking] I heard that you were close to him than others. [scoffs] Is there anything you would like to tell me about your hero? He is not a hero. But a villain. Wohoo! "Baby hold your breath" "Every move I make, they make your eyes go star-struck" "Baby, wait a sec..." "your beauty has beseeched me into a trance. Baby, I'm a love drug..." "Let me tease you, girl and chase your heart... Just feel it." "I can steal the dreams that you haven't dreamt of, baby" "Half of me is crazy and the other half is bad, girl" "Baby, I'm a bad boy. Can you be my bad girl?" [machine gun fire] [helicopter thumping] "High, baby, so high. I... S-T-A-Y F-L-Y" "Fly, like a helicopter, yo. I will make you spin with my X-factor, yo" "Just cash. No cheques... My game is on and my sway is intense." "Baby, I'm in the mood and I'll turn your boyfriend into your ex" "Boy, I'mma roll with you... roll with you... I came under your spell" "I got caught in the invasion of your shooting glances and fell for you, boy" "Boy, I'mma roll with you... roll with you... I came under your spell" "I got caught in the invasion of your shooting glances and fell for you, boy" "You are fire and I'm gasoline, boy. Take me higher. You know what I mean, boy." "Kiss me, baby" "I'm a mad girl like you. I know, you're a bad boy. I can be your bad girl" "Baby, I'm a bad boy. Can you be my bad girl?" "I know, you're a bad boy. I can be your bad girl" If the celebration is of this scale... I wonder what might be the extent of the next mission! "I know, you're a bad boy. I can be your bad girl" [shatters] "I know, you're a bad boy. I can be your bad girl" "Baby, I'm a bad boy. Can you be my bad girl?" [wind whooshing] [chandelier clinks] I heard that the Franco brothers fear nothing. With these guys around them, they will never know what fear really is. If you guys are on our side, the board members too will come to our side out of fear. After that, Devaraj will eventually take over the chair. Royâ€™s son is back. Why do we need Devaraj now? First, make arrangements to get all the money out of his lockers. After that, you can go and sit on his chair. [speaks foreign language] [laughs] [gun cocks] Have you heard about Karana village? [gunfire] [people screaming] They were burnt to ashes right under your feet. This might be a desert for you. But for me, itâ€™s my foundation. [gun cocks] Forgive me. [gunshot] Vishwak, we lost the Black box We have only two weeks left. [scoffs] The lost device has a tracking system. For the next 48 hours... wherever it is in the world, it can be seen on this screen. If you miss it this time, I will kill you for sure. One two three four.... [club music] Thank you. Wow! What a place this is, brother! Surrounded by girls and beer in our hands. Wow! It would be nice if we settle down in this place. Well, bro... Why are you so fond of me? [phone rings] What? Stay here. I will come back and tell you. Take your time, brother. No problem. Hey girl... Get me a Biryani. -Go -What was that? [lock blips] [shots fired] Who is it, darling? Why are you so frustrated? Whatever it is, let's talk over. [gun shot] Who the hell are you? Who are you, man? [ring clinks] At least, give an answer and fire. [ring clinks] Ammu? It took me two days to find this place. [bottle tumbles] [glass shatters] Hey, girl. Where is my biryani? [crowd cheering] [gun cocks] The magazine is empty dear. [gun cocks] Hmph! Do you think I will come with just one magazine even after knowing you? The police brain too has become sharp after staying with a thief. It of no use shooting you here. Because there is nothing in there. Everything is in here. This is the room 106. If this gun was in your hand and you were in a similar situation... What would you do? I wouldn't have had such a discussion. [gunshot] Why did you fire like that? A small confusion. I'm sure it is 105. I swear. Itâ€™s a waste to discuss with you. [slams door] Ow! Huh! Shoot! [machine gun fire] [gunfire] [jazz music] [gunfire] Stop! Go... Go... Go... [gunfire] [gun cocks] [gunfire] [glass shatters] [jazz music] [gunfire] [gas hisses] [water splashes] [groans] [gunfire] [gun shots] [bullet whizzing past] [groans] [gunshots] [groans] [gun empty] [groans] [groans] [groans] [fire crackles] [door opens] [gun cocks] [gunshot] [groans] Who are these people? They seem more frustrated than me. Fans. [gun fire] Why are they extremely violent? They are die-hard fans! They won't leave until they kill. [machine gun fire] Oh no! [jazz music] [gunfire] [groans] Go! [pants] If I ever die, it would be in your hands. Go now. [electricity buzzes] I will come to the point. Heard that you have stolen the Black Box unwittingly. Return it. If you want, I will join you in this gang as a bonus. [clears throat] [laughs] Hey, stop! Get back! Cool, bro. I will give you five lakhs. Stop it. Ten lakhs. One crore. What! There is a price for everything. His price is one crore. Then, how much price should be the price of the Black Box? And how much more should be my price, the guy who stole it? [groans] Saaho... A tiger and a deer exist in the same forest, but not in the same room. If that's the situation, imagine how brutally the tiger would kill the deer. [scoffs] Then, tell that deer not to come into my room. Devaraj, let's kill him. Leave him. [birds chirping] 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22... I should immediately inform Saaho. Bro... Bro... There are police everywhere. Let vacate this place immediately. Saaho... Where is the socket? I can't find it. Check at the corner on your right. Oh! Hi, David. What's she doing here, bro? I am asking you, your highness. As if we're having a dearth of existent Tsunamis, should we have this hurricane Hud-hud too? [hair dryer whirring] Well... What do you want? Don't you know? I've involved you in the robbery without your knowledge. Right. So, you were suspended from the police department. Right. Hello. What's the matter now? Do you need a share in the robbery? Right. Are you tempting? But I'm feeling it. Don't get tempted at all, bro. A police should never be trusted. You don't say that. It's very disgusting to hear. I believe you are a good police officer. But... our department thinks otherwise, about you. Tsk... I mean... Let's prove them wrong. "Being together with you this way" "Is like a dream to me" "Is the sky with it's head bent in respect..." "...waiting just for me?" "Has the distance faded away?" "It was my mistake to leave you" "Trust me now..." "I'll make every dream of yours come true" "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "I thought I wouldn't suit you..." "and not to come to you" "Only then I came to know..." "that I'm in your heart" "The doubt that breaks us apart" "I'm happy if you let go of it" "The time has united us" "All the anger has vanished" "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "Travelling distances, heart should leave it's stubbornness" "We'd realise the truth that moment" "In a way that the dream you've never seen in your sleep is before you" "I'll show you the past moments, dear" "I'm present inside you even if not by your side" "I've witnessed all the dreams you've dreamt" "What you've painted has taken life form" "and is present before your eyes today" "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." "Baby won't you tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me" "Baby won't you tell me so..." We just have a week of time... ...to save Roy group. Correct I came to know that you came down after Roy's death But I couldn't meet you I've seen Roy talking right here for his last time I never imagined that the mishap would take place later Anything needed... Call [fire crackling] Now it's perfect Do you think I'll be impressed with such things? Whatever you do, this is a half burnt book Certain things can never be perfect Just like us... Are you mad? We are just like the day and night When one comes, the other needs to leave Both can never co-exist Day and night co-exist too Amritha They call it the Twilight Just like us... There's trust, and there's fear Every night has it's day [gun fired] [gasps] [Amritha groans] [stranger groans] [gun fired] [tranquiliser fired] [groans] [plays piano] I was very naughty in my childhood I've never used to sleep at a place My uncle threatened me that the ghost under bed would eat me if I didn't sleep I've never got down the bed since that day out of fear I used to be on the bed quietly One day, I wanted to take a look at the ghost that I was so scared of and took a peek under the bed bravely. There was no ghost there First, my fear came down Aftet that, being very angry on my uncle, I stabbed him to death Then I was scared again! Then I went to hide under the same bed It was then that I understood... The ghost wasn't under my bed... but was inside me When someone does things I don't like... The ghost inside me comes out in this way Now you won't just give me that Black Box but will also do another work for me [panting] [electronic beep] [printer buzzes] I've got all the permissions you asked from Waaji city police Journey is on Ashok. All the best! Saaho... I'm coming to you Saaho... What's the plan? [drones buzzing] This is the building that contains money, and this is where the locker location is It's a highly secured place and that is why this plan We'll fix bombs in the ceilings of the 28 floors under the locker's floor Once we press this trigger... [tiny blast] Boom! Impossible! [laughs] Go ahead You want to see Roy's son be ruined instead of killing him? Saaho will do that for you Welcome to Waaji, Ashok We have the best police control system in the world [indistinctive conversation] This is our main command center We monitor and control every inch of Waaji from here Jet Man, a state-of-art flying machine We only use it in Code Red emergencies Don't worry Saaho Amritha would be safe What do we do with this girl Devaraj? We've got to keep her with us to control Saaho [thud] [chain clinks] Fish is the queen of water Water is its life, no matter Touch it and it would feel dread Take it out... ...and it's so dead! [laughs] [shutter clicks] Hey David! Huh? What did you do to my daughter? [sighs] Don't worry She's safe with your wife But your wife? She's safe with us, don't worry But if she is missing from us... [glass breaks] Now you need to worry All the people out have started sir Such great work of Saaho deserves a good gift Give him that girl back... After you kill her [car engine revving] [laughs] [indistinctive screams on TV] [unlocks] We're about to reach in five minutes We're also reaching in five minutes I met Ashok last night He blackmailed me using my family as leverage... I've revealed our entire plan [device beeps] Even now, he is able to listen to our conversation Damn! What to do now? We'll catch him if he returns else he would end up losing Whatever it is, it's me who wins finally Come on! [Amritha groans] [man laughs] Devaraj... That day, you whispered to me in a way that only I could understand Today, I'll make everyone understand and announce it so loud that your ear drums would blast Ashok Chakravarty I thought you know me better than anyone does How could you miss it? I've created so many things in the plan, can't I create a fake family for him? You gave Saaho an offer But Saaho gave me a bigger offer than that He gave me back my Black Box I'm giving him back what he wants [shot fired] [indistinctive screams] [shots fired] [shots fired] [groans] [shots fired] [honks] [cop sirens wailing] Zoom in there Ashok, they've reached! [cop sirens wailing] Move... Move! [indistinctive shouts] [indistinctive chatter] [cop sirens wailing] Hey! [cop sirens wailing] Freeze!

Can I go with the snipers? Thank you sir [bike engine revving] -Saaho -David? -They're very near to you. Saaho? -David dsf [machine gun fire] [roars] [shots fired] [machine gun fire] [groans] [machine gun fire] [machine gun fire] Guys don't let him cros the bridge!

Have some water No [device blips] [device blips] [footsteps running] Center. Center do you copy? There seems to be a problem There seems to be a problem We got both of them The containers in both locations are empty. The containers are empty. We have lost the original trucks. What happened Ashok? He got the entire police force on his trail... and diverted the money loaded trucks out of the city. [tyres screech] I will take care of Saaho Don't worry Ashok... I foudn this with him Cop: Well... we will trace him Keep the Black box safe until the board meeting ends. Okay sir [footsteps] Amritha? How do you know about this place? After Saaho was caught, everyoneâ€™s attention was on him. But my attention went to the last call on his phone. Why do you doubt Shinde all of a sudden? The doubt has been there since long I am just confirming it now. [blips] Wait.. wait... Alex Fernandes... How is he connected to Shinde? Where is he right now? Take right to Karana village. [tyres screech] Damn! Not again! We've got the best force. How did he get away? They will not come. Because that's the kind of story that village has. Just as they tell a story to make small children eat... I am going to tell you a story to get you ready. No one knows that story till now. A story that you and Roy wanted to know since a long time. The storyâ€™s name is Karana. A village full of people. Under that village, lay an unimaginable ocean of oil We threatened the people to leave the city. But because of Royâ€™s support, no one listened to us. Would I keep quiet then? [machine guns fired] [people screaming] [people screaming] A person has inflicted me with the pain that I saw in all their faces back then Now I will get him to the same village and give him all the fear that I gave those people to him alone [music] [chains clink] Saaho... you've meddled a lot with Devaraj Now I fear what all he'd do to you Best of luck! [air whooshing] [groans] [Saaho groans] [indistinctive chatter] Do you know Alex Fernandes? [men laugh] [Saaho groans] [chains clink] [man roars] [chains clink] [metal clanks] [man screams] Aren't you the one who ran away in Mumbai when you saw me? By the time they come, you will die. Tell me. Why did you run away? [fire crackles] [water burbling] [glass shatters] [Amritha groans] [chains clink] [chain clinks] [knocks] [guns cocked] Let him in [cocks gun] Did you get any information? Basha, as you said, we checked everyoneâ€™s call records from the Roy Group. The person who leaked all the information from us was none other than... [gun cocked] Huh? Kalki Is it you who did all of this? How can you be so selfish? When men like you can be so selfish... we are the women who gave birth to you... How selfish should we be? [gun shot] [groans] [weapon swishes] [groans] Hey! [groans] [screaming] Hey! I'm thinking about where to begin such a huge story. [coin clinks] It's gone... Then it's correct to start it from the thief. Hey! Hey! [clunks] [truck clunks] [truck clunks] [glass shuttering] [groans] [slits flesh] [groans] [weapon clunks] Devaraj, now the Black Box is with us. -We are going to win. -Okay. I can understand by looking at his face, that he was beaten up pretty badly. It's not his blood. It's our blood, sir. No one has given me so much trouble in my life until now. I want to see your brain that gave me sleepless nights by removing it out. Get ready for the battle. [light machine gun fire] [electronic blipping] [door mechanism buzzes] In the process of identifying who is behind the three Mumbai robberies I've identified whom the money belongs to It's the Roy group I thought why you were silent even after losing so much money Then I understood... It was to create a thief [chain clinks] Saaho used the cops and stole the Black Box from the bank And using the same Black Box... he stole the money by crashing the buildings of Devaraj and Prince Altogether it is... Two trillions... I could even ask you a lakh of times for that But I don't have that time There's a chair and an empire waiting for me [electronic buzz] [electronic buzz] You've invented the black box to steal the money from Devaraj and Prince But what did you put in the locker that could be opened by the black box? [electronic beeps] There's no money in there... This question gave me another mind blowing answer The money in Devaraj's locker... and the money that was considered to be lost in Roy's ship Both are the same That's not in the trucks Where's it then? [music starts] [music continues playing] Even after I found answers to all the questions There is one more question left that's not yet understood What's your connection with Saaho? [toy creaks] [inhaler hisses] What's the link between Saaho and this instrument? Does this instrument contain the answer to all questions? [indistinctive shouts] [screams] [plate breaks] Tell me... who were you running away from? Tell me! You've sold guns to three men Where are they? I've saved your life. It doesn't take time to take it La... Lal Bungalow! [shot fired] What's this? Sth... Sthitha... [Sanskrit Verses] [Sanskrit Verses] [Sanskrit Verses] [Sanskrit Verses] It means, at certain times... To save kingdoms The king himself comes down like a General [roars] 'Hiding from the same world...' 'Roy had brought up his son somewhere far away' After fighting the war... and after securing his kingdom he'd sit on the throne like a king again! Roy protected Karana for 15 years But Devaraj ended it all in one night Have you understood who's the king? [groans] [chain clinks] [roars] It took me 20 years... to live with my father [mobile vibrates] Tell me Where are you dad? Ballard-Pier route I've been away from my dad since my childhood You always say you have to tell me something What's it son? It's nothing dad I wanted to return home everytime he met me We needn't stay apart anymore I'll introduce you to the world tomorrow What happened? Anything you want to say? We'll meet tomorrow anyhow I'll tell you directly [bang] [groans] Dad... Dad? Dad... [groans] Roy... Did you ever imagine... that you'd die miserably on the road? I did! Ready? [bullet fired] [thunders rumbling] 'You always say you have to tell me something' 'What's it son?' [gasps] [sobs] I love you dad We shall leave no one! We'll kill everyone Not just killing... First, we should complete what Roy wanted to do Don't forget that So does that mean we leave them, dad? No... They've shot 36 bullets into you dad I'll make them pay for every single bullet I could have killed you the same day But before that, I should show you your doom [chains clink] [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] I have to tell an important thing to all of you Roy's heir that he hid from us all these days has put an end to the blood shed and is about to show himself to all of us The one whom you've thought was Roy's son all these days isn't Roy's son actually. But he's my son Iqbal Have you lost it? How can Devaraj die? What are you talking? [groans] [groans] [chopper blades whirring] [gasps] [chopper blades whirring] 'This is my favourite lighter' 'It's an antique!' 'It would only have looked more beautiful if I had it's missing part' [chopper blades whirring] Siddhanth Nandan Saaho Hello and welcome to the morning show on 'News at 9'!
