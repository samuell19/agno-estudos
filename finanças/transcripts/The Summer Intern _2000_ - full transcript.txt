(dramatic music) (dog growling) - [Man] Stay. - [Man] You're late Mohair and you look like hell. - Slept in the car sir. - Weapon. Check it. Where's agent Cooley? - Returning from Nevada from the Burning Man Festival, sir. - Possible aliens? - No, sir, just Deadheads. - Damn it. Got a new file for you, Mohair. - Subject? - Mad inventor. - Security risk, sir? - Maybe. - Tyler Driscoll. We dropped the ball on him when Y2K hit. - [Mohair] Tyler Driscoll, a face from the past. The head of the government's cold fusion weapons program in the '70s. He and his scientists cost me my promotion. Kept me out of the big leagues. - You're gonna have to pick up the pieces on this one, Mohair. Put it back together for us. - This file have a name, sir? - What do you think? Never mind. Get some sleep, Mohair. - Perhaps he needs a good ass kicking, sir. - Tried it. Tried everything. Candy, flowers. Even executed his dog, but he still can't say X. - Forgot my gun, sir. Safety on? - No. (gun shooting) (dramatic music) - We're downloading the satellite feed from the unit 54 GPS. - This better be good. Let's have a look at this Driscoll gang. - Tyler Driscoll, you know the story. Next image. Bryce Driscoll, younger of two brothers. High school dropout. Apparently he inherited his father's genes, kid's IQ is way up there. Kid lives in a camper behind his mother's house. Next image, Joseph Driscoll. Joey, to his friends. Another high school dropout. - IQ? - Doesn't have one. His friend, Pete Piper, sketchy background. Drives a delivery truck for McDuff Ice. They saw some action in Grenada for three days. And Betty Boop Driscoll. A tattoo artist, no priors. And finally, Tyler Driscoll's brother. Albert, Uncle Albert to the boys. Diagnosed with a brain tumor two years ago. Surgeon got a little happy with the scalpel. - Him? I want all your efforts placed on him. There's something in the eyes. Just like his father. (whimsical music) - The boy wonder in the midst of his creations. (exploding) - That was interesting. (coughing) - Another town, another case, Agent Mohair. - This town reeks of commies, Agent Cooley. - That's why we're here. To keep this country safe. (dramatic music) (engine starting) - Hey, come on. - Coming. - Saturday at noon and you're still sleeping. - I was working all night. - Doing what? - Making a bomb, what do you think? - The party's starting without ya. - I totally forgot about Pete's. I'm gonna pass. - No. No, you're going to the party. You get dressed. I'll wait for ya. Go on. Get dressed. (sizzling) (engine roaring) - Incoming. - You mean they really came? - Ready? - Ready. (rock music) (bell dinging) - Vroom, vroom, vroom. - Huh. Nice place. - Yeah, used to be a crack house. - Ladies. You ladies look hot. - We are hot. - It's real hot. - Joey. - That him? - Yeah, that's my little brother. (laughing) - Your brother? Which litter? (laughing) - Yeah, which litter? - Forgot about the snorts. - I'll have another, if you please. - So, Listy, what's doing? - You know me and Cynthie just been riding the hog, feeding the dog, got a haircut, like it? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really suits your face. - Yeah. (snapping) - Covers up my scars pretty good, don't you think? - [Man] You always were a real stunner. - You can't see my stitches or my plate or nothing. Got the cooties again, though. (breathing heavily) - You got a name? - Yeah. Bryce. Would you like a beer? It's all we have left. (sighing) - It's hot. - So, anyway, the doctor had to stitch up this side of my face to match the other side of my face, for balance, he said. And he said I was lucky that I didn't lose more teeth when I slid and that I was lucky I didn't bite my tongue half off. See? - Damn bike. - I'm sorry. Say something? - That bike, it's killing me. - My head swole up as big as a watermelon full of water and stuff and the doctor had to use a straw to drain it. - I know a little bit about engines. - So does my old man, but he's in prison. OK, you got two minutes. - Two minutes? For what? - To become interesting. - So, the doctor said that if I wear the leg brace he gave me for about a year, my one leg will be as long as the other leg. - Well, I really think that your problem has to do with your pistons, you know. But it could be a ball bearing, that your ball bearings are so worn out that it's causing you to overheat. - Well, this one's a beaut. - But you know, I really think that you gotta check out that oil pan because if you're not getting enough lubrication to your system-- - You sure do talk pretty. - Boob job's healing up. Oh, I showed you that last time. - Tell me about the high compression engines again. - Well, like I said earlier, it's a four stroke system. - And that is what they call an appendicitis. - She'd make a good agent. - Scary. - Yeah. - The flowers sure look nice, son. - Oh, thanks, Ma. - And he's happy. - Yeah. I think he actually invested something yesterday. - [Ma] He's getting more like his dad every day. (train whistling) - [Man] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the McDuff Ice Company. These are your aprons. After receiving your aprons, every intern must report to the receptionist for further instructions. - This is the phone. This is the tape. This is the stapler. This is the lamp. This is the, this has names on it. This is the roll o thingy. - [Woman] Gate five is now open. (dramatic music) - No, I'm sorry, the sales internship has been filled. The accounting internship is filled, as well. - You must decide, before any contact is made, exactly what you want. Write it down. Not with a marker. - Do you see a computer? Do I look like a computer? Duh. - Excuse me, are you new here? - Yes, it's my first day. I'm a summer intern. - Oh, really, then I guess you know who I am, huh? - No. - You're in my spot. - Do I look like I would know where the men's room is? - Learn from your experience, got it? - Yes, sir. - Got that outward look, not sure you understand. - You have mail. - Are you Mr. Hamilton? - Yeah, I am. - These are for you. - Great, thanks. Are you new here? - Yes, it's my first day. I'm a summer intern. - Oh, where are the other interns at? - They're on the back dock, sir. - Hey, listen, you need anything, you come to me, huh? - Thank you. - Anything. - Now repeat after me. They will say "Yes" to my request. - [All] They will say "Yes" to my request. - They must say "No" to another's request. - [All] They must say "No" to another's request. - You've got sales, go sell. - [Woman] Interns are reminded you work at your own risk. Anymore interns falling off the dock will be fired. (snoring) Somebody pick up line four already. - I want you to know that I personally picked you. - Kid's boss is a real twit. - You do have my business card, right? - I sure do. - All you ladies have my business cards, right? OK, you know, you can call me at home, right? - Come on, I don't have all day, let's move it. - So, listen, do me a favor, right? You don't hit on any of these girls, right? - Of course. - They're mine, right? - Of course. - Dock two is now open. Bob Hamilton, your Turkish buck master is at the mail desk. - Building's old, the walls are pretty thick, but it looks like a kid's working in the basement. - Basement. Dark, dreary, cold, and claustrophobic. (tense music) - [Woman] Will the intern who parked in Mr. Hamilton's spot report to his office immediately? (phone ringing) - Belinda? I got Miss Monahan another gift. - Let me see. Do you think you could afford a bigger box of chocolates? - Life is like a small box of chocolates. - There's a piece missing, Bernie. - Well, I wasn't sure she liked the dark ones. - Chocolates, for an angel. Thank you, Bernie. (sighing) - Today, Miss Monahan? - No, Mr. McDuff isn't in yet. I'll let you know. Oh, by the way, you have a delivery at reception. Oh, don't worry, Belinda doesn't bite. Come on, Bryce, chin up, back straight. Go on. - Thanks, Miss Monahan. (phone ringing) (harmonica music) - Will you lather me? - It might take a while. - I know. Oh, it's you. You have a package. (saxophone music) Smells like chemicals. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - So, box boy, Hamilton wanted me to ask you, what do you do in that basement all day, anyway? - Well, I'm records management. And I invent things for the company. - Oh, like R and B? - Well, it's R and D. - Whatever. What's to invent, anyway? We make ice. Wet and dry. It's in our brochure. Water in cold temperature, and boom, you're done. - Well, there are other elements to-- - Save the speeches, box boy. (phone ringing) Hamilton wanted to make sure you're not down there popping off. - [Woman] I want to make love to you. - What? - I want to make love to you. (electronic music) - What? - I want to make love to you. - So. I saw you talking to Belinda. She really gets to you, doesn't she? - Agents Mohair and who? - Cooley. - Oh, just a second. Surveillance unit 54 is calling in, sir. - Mohair and Cooley. - Yes, sir. Mohair wants to know about his per diem, and which motel to use. Do we have a contract with Motel Six, Motel Seven, or Motel Eight? - Damn it, Mohair, you are undercover. You sleep in the car. Boy's in the front, girl's in the back. It's in the manual. - Oh, yes, sir. - Give me Cooley. - Right away, sir. It's for you, it's the boss. (laughing) - Well, the genius is finally asleep. - He's not a genius, he's an intern. - Well, at least he's got a job, Joey. - I got a job. - He's got a job with some potential. - I got potential. (belches) - You know the worst thing about this job, Cooley? - I know, the waiting. - No. The sleeping. (sighing) - Listen up, agents. The first rule of operation in the field, a good offense is a good defense. Agent Lin, demonstrate. Very good. Agent Kelly, front and center. Very good. - I knew you'd see it my way sooner or later. Got you everything on the list. Professional strength drain opener. Bacterial cultures. Surficants with enzyme action? - Enzymes, they release a gas, the gas interacts with the oxygen sulfur. - Whatever. Don't think I ain't got better things to do on my break. (booming) - What's that? - Hear something? - Do you hear that? - What? - Look. - What the heck is that? (thudding) - It's coming. - What's coming? - It. It's alive. - I thought I would find you lollygagging out here. - I'm on break. - You were on break. Mr. Funny. Unless you got a problem with that. - No, no problem. - We got three pallets blocking aisle five, I want them stacked in aisle six. Tag 'em and bag 'em. - Stack 'em in aisle six. Tag 'em and bag 'em. (laughing) No, I'm on break, and besides, I hurt my foot this morning when all those cans fell on it, remember? - So you hurt your foot. Let me make an adjustment. (groaning) There. Foot is like brand new now. Get downstairs and get to work. (laughing) - Whatever kind of bomb you decide to make, make two. (country music) - Wow, what a great place. - My place. Shoplifters will be flogged and persecuted. (dinging) Customer. - I mean, you folks sure got a lot of nice things around here. What I'm looking for is an oscillator. It's a device that produces alternating current. I looked everywhere. Pawn shops, swap meets and junkyards and flea markets. - But not Cadillac Jack's. I got oscillators coming out my butt. Hey, take Prince Charming down to the dungeon. - The dungeon? - You break it, you buy it. - I'm an inventor. - Really? You know what I like most about inventors? All the things they don't invent while they're trying to invent. Continuing. Welcome to the dungeon. Oh, as I was saying about inventors. Take Thomas Edison for example. Not only did he know how to make a light bulb, he knew 180 ways how not to make a light bulb. So, you got a name? - Bryce. - Marnie. Your typical country girl. Married? - No. - Single? - Yeah. - Straight? - Yeah. - Listen to me, I sound like the Maytag repair man. - Oscillators? - The mother lode. - Thanks. - You know where to find me. He'll be back. - Whatever you say, honey. Whatever you say. - This pawn shop, you think it's a drop? - Anything's possible. One thing for sure, this Bryce kid, he's one smooth operator. - Let's get back in the car before we're spotted. - Anything on this Cadillac Jack? - Former military man, a real patriot. - The Driscoll boy bought oscillators from him. - Oscillator. What the hell's an oscillator? - A device used for alternating current, sir. - In English, man, in English. - A device used for alternating current, sir. - What about the dungeon? - Turned out to be a basement, sir. - Mohair. That moron. - Take that, you vermin. Damn squirrels. - What's he doing now? - Flushing out wildlife. (horn music) - Geez, I hate this house. (barking) Here we go again. (knocking) Pizza guy. - Incoming. - [Man] Come on, Uncle Albert, it's just the pizza guy. - Pizza guy? - Duh. - Umbrella, good idea. - Hi, Uncle Albert. - Is that him? - Yep. - How do we know it's him? - Because every Saturday at three o'clock, you guys order two sausage pizzas, and every Saturday at 3:30, I deliver 'em. - I'm serious, man. - Aw, come on, Pete, Grenada's over. If it ever really began. - Oh, it began. Those glasses, are they a disguise? - No. - Have you ever been strip searched? - It's none of your business. All right, nickels this week. - Shiny ones for you. And keep the sock. - Hey, pizza man. (sizzling) - Next week, call Domino's. (groaning) I hate this job. - Agents arrested the pizza boy, sir. They even searched his car. - Find anything? - No, sir. Just some empty Slim Fast cans, a few workout tapes. - He's holding back. I want him arrested. Dragged into our nearest satellite office and interrogated. Strip search him if you have to. - Sir, I don't think we want to have to do that. - Why not? OK, forget the strip search. - Thanks a lot, Mr. Haynes. I really appreciate it. - Oh, it's only an old toilet. - It's more than that to me. - Strange boy. - Never thought I'd get rid of that damn toilet. - Very interesting. - The kid bought a toilet? (dramatic music) - [Policeman] This is the police. Step away from the commode, kid, and nobody gets hurt. - Oh, yeah, copper? Well, I'm not alone, see? I got a dame with me. - Yeah, dame. A real chunk of a dame. - It's me and you, baby. Me and you against the world. - Yeah, me and you and this thing. - Top of the world, PD. - Yeah, top of the world. - The toilet is the key. (panting) - Is Albert medicated yet? - Doctor's orders. - Hey. You know? If I could just have one or two of those for post traumatic stress syndrome. - For Grenada? - It would be-- - Try PEZ. - What's with Uncle Albert? - The doctors say he doesn't get enough oxygen to his brain and that affects his central nervous system. - Oh. (honking) - Hey, Betty Boop. - Hey, Mom, sounds like Toons is here. (grunting) There you go, Ma. Hey, Toons, how's it going? - Good. How's it running? - It ran pretty good all the way from Sturgis. Idling a little rough, though. - Drag. - Hey, you watch that drinking. I mean it now, Joey. If I'm not back by dawn, send the dogs. (engine roaring) - Hey, Ma, shouldn't you be wearing your helmet? Hey, you like doing yard work? - No. - Yard work sucks. - Tell me about it. (dramatic music) - So, when's your flight to the moon? - Some day soon. How's the job? - He's got his own department down in the basement. - Yeah, doing what? - Records management. Monahan lets me run my own experiments. - Well, whatever you're working on this time can't be pretty. (laughing) So, what's the chick situation like at work? - Belinda? He looks at her like a dog in heat. - [Bryce] Hey, leave Belinda out of this. I got something more important to show you guys. I've been looking through Dad's notes, and I found another benefit of his cold fusion research. This will blow people away. (crashing) - Used to be a toilet. - Yeah, I separated the collinite from the feldspar in the quartz, acts like a binding agent. - What's that? - Secret formula. - Trippy, man. - And Miss Monahan's got me on standby with the old man tomorrow, even if he is crazier than a loon. But with this, I might just change all of that. - Hey, like, don't you gotta have a license to practice medicine? - I'm just trying to help people. - The FDA, man. The Food and Drug Administration dudes. They'll make you vanish. - What's your take on these guys? - Lunatics. - FDA, never heard of 'em. - Food and Drug Administration, sir. - I want follow up. - Silver. Mellow yellow. Forest green. Turd brown. Scrunch. Scrunch. - He's got an IQ of 185. Put it in perspective. - He's up there with Einstein. Ralph Nader. - Dan Quayle. - Holy mother of God. (snoring) - Sorry. (calypso music) - You kiss like an angel. - Kid's a sex maniac. - Don't you ever tell anybody. - Twisted. - Sick. - This is going in my report. - Well, I take pictures. - Anything on the dog? - She's a cocker spaniel, sir. - Get me everything you can on fetishes. - Pictures, videos, and charts with that, sir? - What do you think? - I'm on it. - Oh, and send a copy to my house. - [Woman] Barney Hill, your mother is on line two. - Listen up, interns. You never know who the enemy is. (dramatic music) - Unit 54, in position for audio surveillance. (chattering) - What, do you carry your lunch in that bag? - No, it's an experiment. - Kid thinks he's an inventor. - I bet his whole life is an experiment. - That is not a cocker spaniel. - Four blocks of ice. - Greeks. You know they're all CIA. - CIA. - Think about it. Greek restaurants. They never have any customers, why? Because nobody in this country eats Greek food, especially gyros. - Get. Get me everything you know about Greeks in the CIA. And don't forget the information I requested on the FDA. - Whoa, whoa. - Excuse me. - You that basement guy? What's your name? - Bryce Driscoll. - Bryce Driscoll. I'm Bob Hamilton. I'm the top salesman around here. You know, I see you spending a lot of time up there at that front desk. That receptionist, Belinda, she gets to you, doesn't she? - I'm sorry, Mr. Hamilton? - Belinda. The receptionist. She gets to you, doesn't she? But listen, a little bit of advice for you. If you really want a girl like Belinda, it's gonna cost you this, OK? And a little bit more advice for ya. Start thinking of me as your future, OK? - But I thought you said you were a salesman. - No, no, no. I'm the top salesman, huh? Number two man. - [Woman] Arnie McLost, line one. (steam whistling) - Temperature's rising, Agent Cooley. - It is summer. - Something's gotta give here. Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn. - Don't crap on me now, Mohair. - Sorry, sorry, OK. I lost it there for a second. My mind wandered, I was thinking about my old partner. - The one abducted by aliens? - No. The one who shot himself in his sleep. You know, just when you think you know a guy. (phone ringing) - Thanks. - You're welcome. A dress shirt. A job interview, perhaps? - Remember when you said I could have a half day off to take care of some personal business? - Don't worry, Bryce, I'll cover for ya. - Thanks. - How have your first few weeks been? - Oh, great. I moved in all my experiments and records management. - I know, you can do it blindfolded. - How's Agent Mohair doing? - Agent Cooley says he's cracking up, sir. - Well, we all have our limits. I can't take this anymore. I'm cracking up. - Perhaps you'd like a good ass kicking, sir. Ass kicking sir, ass kicking sir, ass kicking sir. (laughing) - There's our boy. - Mm hmm. - Why don't you follow him and see what he's up to? - This could be interesting. (chattering) - Dr. Piccolo 's office, how can I help you? - I don't want you to fear Mike, I just want you-- - Serve your sexual needs. - You are the prettiest little goat. - The doctor can sleep with your wife on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson. That's right, from 11 to 11:15. Will you be attending? Fine, Mrs. Johnson plus one. And please remind her to wear her diaphragm this time. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. May I help you? - Bryce Driscoll, I have an appointment. - Sexual surrogation or counseling? - Well, I have a question. Dr. Piccolo is, is he a doctor or a veterinarian? - Oh, Dr. Piccolo is many things to many people. - How does the sex surrogate thing work? - First visit, first visits are always counseling. Have a seat and Dr. Piccolo will be right with you. Sit. - Breathe. There you go. - You know, my wife only lets me do it twice a week. Hey. Liquid Viagra. (laughing) - So, your parakeet's been talking dirty to you and you want it to stop? Mm hmm. No, I wouldn't advise exorcism. - OK, the doctor is, he's a Renaissance man, OK? So never, ever, never, ever mention that little prison thing, OK? (laughing) - Kid went into a sex therapist's office. (beeping) - Next. - No, sir. The internet is not what we consider healthy sex. - I'm not here for sexual surrogation. - Oh, this? That was my wife. She has a desktop phobia. - You're the prettiest little Tinkerbell there is in the whole world, yes. - So, you're a virgin, I see. - I didn't offer that information. - Teddy bear? - No thanks. - But you are a virgin, aren't you? - Well, yes. I suppose I do qualify. - Yes, I knew it. - The doctor would like you to please stop feeding your hamster pork sausage. - So, tell me. What exactly is your sexual hangup? - Well, I've been having these dreams. - Dreams, yes, I like dreams. Tell me about your dreams. Tell me about your deepest, darkest fantasies. Is there nudity in these dreams? - No. - Bikini thongs? - No. - Tanning oils? - No. - Pedicures? - Not really. - Oh. - But there are costumes. - Costumes, I love costumes. Bright costumes with tiny little see through swatches. You know, I think we can have the session. Adjusting, perfectly normal. - Well, I know your sister's always in the room with you, but you guys are Siamese twins. - This touching yourself five, 10 times a day? - I never said that. - Exactly. You do have insurance, don't you? - No. - [Piccolo] No insurance? (bleating) (tense music) - Think the kid spotted us? - Maybe, maybe not. One thing for sure, he knows about him. - Yeah, but how much does he know? His dad goes underground with a top security clearance, and the boss takes the hit. - Think the kid's sitting on his old man's notes? - That's what we're here to find out. - No activity on the reclusive father. No hidden expense accounts, no bank accounts, no credit cards. For practical purposes, the old man lives off his pension. - Damn. - Why can't I get it? - I'm looking at money, Bernie. I think I found a formula. - Did you get the kid again? - What's to get, the kid works in the basement. (laughing) Shut up. Too much sugar, Bernie. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Shut up. - Do you think the kid really has something? - Kid doesn't know that I have access to every computer in the building, including his. The kid's onto something, Bernie. - It looks like science. - It is science, you moron. Have your people check it out. See if it's legit. Meanwhile, anything happens in house, you bring it to me, capisce? - Yes, boss. - Fix the coffee, Bernie. - Yes, boss. - Bernie. Who's the man? - You know the man. - Miss Monahan? Mr. McDuff really wants to see me? - Mr. McDuff really wants to see you. - Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. - Before there was ice, there was water. Before water, there was air. And before air, there was-- - Solidified carbon dioxide, sir. - Dots of dry ice. Infinite reaches. - 78 degrees celsius, sir? - At 78, it turns into a gas to use as a refrigerant. But none of this was possible without-- - The great cataclysm, sir. - The great cataclysm. Hellfire from which the Earth was born. And on the seventh day-- - God rested? - God rested. And then he looked down upon the Earth, he realized-- - People were drinking warm drinks at their picnics, sir? - Warm drinks. Yes. So, God said-- - Sir, I think I have the first of several solutions to this company's financial future. - Why, thank you, my good man. - Well, in fact, it comes in a variety of colors. - Are you from the local Boy Scout troop? - No, sir, I'm one of your summer interns. Now, my invention, I realize, still has a few bugs to be worked out, but, sir, that isn't quite edible just yet, it's still in the cryogenic phase. I need to freeze dry. Whoa. Well, maybe, maybe I downplayed the few bugs part just a little bit. Maybe what I meant to say was it still had many. - Damn Boy Scouts. - He ate another invention. Before or after his theory of the universe? - After. - We'll try him again in a few days. (chattering) - [Woman] Bryce Driscoll, a Dr. Piccolo on line two. - That old man, Mr. McDuff, checked into the hospital, sir. Food poisoning. - Ingredients? - Doctors flushed him before Cooley and Mohair arrived on the scene. Old man thinks Boy Scouts were involved. - Get me everything you can on Boy Scouts. - You're either with me, or you're against me. - I'm with you. - Then check up on the kid. - I'm with you, too, boss. (ominous music) - The gloves, the gloves. You don't leave fingerprints, you don't leave fingerprints. (muttering) (yelling) (crying) - What are you doing in the dark? - Shh. - Why don't you turn on the light? You work here. Why don't you try the combination? - I don't know the combination. - Everybody in the company knows the combination. - They do? (crying) - Another safe. (muttering) Hamilton, I tried, I tried-- - I said the refrigerator, you dummy. - The refrigerator, I knew that. (gasping) - Tell me everything you know about Boy Scouts. - I know they like my cookies. - That's the problem with the self educated, bro. Now, take me for instance. Mind like a sponge. There isn't a chemical or paint ingredient I don't know. Go ahead, ask me a question. - OK. What's in H2O? - Oh, that's an easy one. You got your H and you got your two. - And you got your O? - Yeah. - Yeah, but what is it? - It's the active chemical ingredient in oxygen. - And what's it used for? - Bombs. - Ow. - I'm mad at you. You crybaby. - Oh, my God. Let me see that. We're gonna have to call 911. - Women. They're all hiding something. And that girl that Pete says you work with, that receptionist. - Belinda is a sweet, nice girl. - That's what they said about that Julie chick on the Love Boat. And I hear that Belinda is doing Hamilton, your top salesman, in the ice lockers. - You don't know that. - Oh no? Petey's got the frozen panties to prove it. Just like Julie did a gopher and the doctor and the captain and that bartender dude, what's his name? - Isaac. - As if Julie cared. - Love Boat references? - Could be a kinky sex ring. - I'll check it out. - We'll check it out. We're partners, remember? We work together? - Right. - You know, Belinda's lips are telling you no no, but there's yes yes in her eyes. - I don't believe any of this. (engine stuttering) - Unit 54 update, sir. They spotted the mark doing a drive by on the Tyler McDuff place. Kid never went inside. - Speculations? - The kid knows where his father lives? - Or maybe the kid ran out of gas. Like a fluke. - Bump this over to stats. I want to know the odds of somebody running out of gas in front of their estranged father's house, hmm? Hmm? - I love interns. - Yeah, they do all the work, you got to love it. (laughing) - Where do you guys want this box? - Just put it in there. - All of them? - Yeah, all of them. - What did I tell ya, Bernie? What did I tell ya? They're dipping, they're dipping. Make some phone calls, huh? Make some more calls. Miss Monahan. How are you today? - I'm just fine. - That's good. That's good, you know, I have a big, big surprise for you after lunch. You're gonna like this, I guarantee it, you're gonna like this. - The bald guy with the twitch. He's got informer written all over him. - Bernard Hill. No criminal record. - Not yet. (chattering) - Excuse me everybody. Excuse me. Thank you for coming, ladies and gentlemen. We appreciate it. What you are about to witness is a revolution in the manufacturing of ice. To bring to you what we think is a future of McDuff Ice. Hit it, Bernie. (R and B music) ♫ Revolution is the solution ♫ Revolution is the key ♫ Revolution or pollution ♫ Revolution looking at me ♫ Change ♫ Change ♫ Is the key ♫ Ow ♫ Revolution is the solution ♫ Revolution is the key ♫ Revolution - Revolution is the solution. Get on it. I want this Bernie guy roasted. ♫ Change is the key - Yeah, yeah, let's hear it for Bernie, huh? (applause) And now, ladies and gentlemen, why you're really here. We'd like to introduce to you. Belinda, if you will. Scrunch. What's in Scrunch? We're not exactly sure yet, ladies and gentlemen, but when we find out, we will let you know. - They stole my invention. - It's teamwork, ladies and gentlemen. That's right. McDuff Ice Company through teamwork. - Down the hatch. - [All] Down the hatch. (choking) (coughing) - We still have a few bugs to work out. But when we work them out, we'll be coming back. - Damn Boy Scouts. - We gotta go now. - I dropped my drums, man. Have a nice weekend. - Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure you're aware that Scrunch is now on the street. I'm sure you're also aware of the implications. - But we don't know what it is, sir. - We didn't know what PEZ was. - Isn't PEZ a candy? - Is it? What about the funny plastic boxes and the silly little heads? (saxophone music) - Hmm, looks like we got some action in the basement. - What are you doing here? - I always wondered what you did down here. It's so inventive. - Don't touch that, unless you want 20,000 volts of electricity shooting through you. You'd probably like that, anyway. - You know, I was thinking, maybe, you know, for fun, we could exchange some secret information? You know, maybe you whisper something to me, and I could whisper something to you. And then maybe you could whisper what's missing in the formula. You know, there are other rewards besides financial rewards. - So, this is it? This is what I've been waiting for? You think you can play me to get what you want? - Listen up, popper. Hamilton's all you got, get it? - No, I don't get it. - Well, you better get it. - What, like you get it? - Comes with the paycheck. Basement boy. Crazy basement boy. Basement boy, basement boy. Crazy, hazy basement boy, basement boy, basement boy. Crazy, hazy basement boy, basement boy. - Rewind and let me hear it again. - The night recon team came up with this at Duff Ice. - Anybody see this? - No. We think it may be Scrunch. - This is Scrunch? What the hell is it? - I don't know. Looks like Jell-O. Also comes in a solid form. Take it to the lab? - There's no time. You. Take this. (choking) Somebody get a mop. - Hey, Bryce, you got mail over here. You OK? - Huh? - Pete called from the office. They told me what happened. They ripped you off, huh? - Yeah. - Well, that's the suit and tie world. Backstabbers, pimps, and whores. What are you gonna do about it? - There's nothing I can do. - You could get even. - Joey, I'm a punk kid, OK? - David was a kid when he slew Goliath, and Joan of Arc was a teenager when she saved France and-- - Look around you, Joey. OK? We're Driscolls. We don't lead, we follow. We're losers. - You speak for yourself. - Oh, come on, Joey. You work part time stocking shelves. I'm an intern. An intern, I don't even get paid. You know, just this once, I thought maybe I could do something to make a difference. I thought this was my chance to do something good. - You still do. Maybe it isn't magic marshmallows. Maybe you're destined for greater things. - I'm a failure. - No, Bryce, I'm the failure around here, and we can only have one of us, OK? - You know, just once, I would love to turn the tables on Hamilton and his gang. - Secretary, too? - Belinda? All she did was laugh at me. I can see that now. - So, revenge might be nice, huh? - Real nice. - Well, you're an inventor. Invent something. - Maybe I will. (ominous music) (tense music) - Freeze. OK, Mr. Hill, nice and slow. - This is a stick up. - Try the FBI. We'd like to ask you a few questions. - Everybody knows the combination to the safe. - Nice picture. How does the song go? - Revolution is the solution? - That was an ad campaign from my company. It wasn't my best rap, you know, I do 60's stuff a lot better-- - Sure thing, commie pinko right wing pond scum punk. - All right, all right, I'll tell you anything you want, just give me back my life, I'll tell you anything. - OK, tell me about the summer intern, hmm? - He works in the basement. His name is Bryce Driscoll. He's an inventor, science and chemicals and stuff. He works with oxygen, I don't know. - We're on to you, mister. - I'm not a leader, I'm a follower, ask anybody. - Look, this meeting never happened, got it? - That's right. We're phantoms. Phantoms, you got that? - Meeting never happened. - Phantoms. - Meeting never happened, meeting never happened. Phantoms, never happened, phantoms. - What are those? - The Clinton tapes, sir. - You know, every Thursday at 11, Hamilton sends me to the car wash. He gives me the keys to the car and the house. Make yourself invisible. - Did you get that? - Yeah, the boss's house. - Hey, Pete, don't forget to do the wheels this time. - Sure thing, Mr. Hamilton. We're in. This is it. Wait, wait, Bryce, undercover, come here, come here, come here, undercover, undercover. Man. Geez. Here. Put that on. Camouflage. - Sleeping Beauty makeup? - Hey, it's the best I could do. (tense music) - Viagra. You sure this is gonna work tomorrow? - Look. Every Friday it's happy hour at the Happy Cowhand. And then it's straight to Hamilton's. (knocking) - Knock, knock. Coming down. So, this is how the smaller half lives. - This place is a dungeon. - Consider me the man in the iron mask. (laughing) - That's good. - Would you knock it off? - Good. - So, listen, we thought maybe Belinda could get you to cooperate, but it didn't work, so tell me. What's it gonna take? How can we help you help us? - What do you mean? - Oh, come on, kid. We know you're this close to your secret ingredient. Maybe we can help. - Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork. - Would you knock it off? Come on, what's it gonna take, huh? Maybe a little jump start on a college education. - And to pass the baby dolls. - All new. - All the time. - How about I let you know on Monday? - OK, kid. Monday it is. There's your jump start. Would you knock it off? - Field agent Cooley is requesting audio night surveillance on the Hamilton house, sir. - Grant it. Under one condition. I want us wired in on this one. - Yes, sir. - Car. - That's not him. - This is as good a place as any, Cooley. - That's Hamilton. - [Hamilton] Hey, do I know how to find free food or what, huh? - [Belinda] I know. (laughing) - Well, let's see what's on the radio. - All right. Remote cameras are rolling. And we are locked in. Living room. Bathroom. Bedroom. (beeping) - We're locked in. - Transmission's coming in now, sir. - Get everybody in here. - It's showtime. - [Hamilton] Baby, guess what? Next week, Chinese. (laughing) So, what are we drinking tonight? - Merlot. (laughing) - We've got Merlot. I've got two glasses. I've got the corkscrew. (laughing) So, who's the man? - You da man. - Who's the man? - You da man. - I'll tell ya what, you open the wine, and I get jiggy with it. (laughing) 'Cause who the man? - You da man. - OK, Hamilton's on the move. The wine, yes. - What's in it? - Concentrated pinto bean extract. (laughing) - You can do this. You can do this. - The lush? - OK, OK. You can do this, Henry. You can do this. And you can do this, Spammy, you can do this. - Spammy? - Spammy. Code word? - Yeah. Sounds like an operative. South American, maybe. (tense music) - She drank the whole bottle. - That guy showers in it. What's in it? - Harmless time release skin dye. Think of it as invisible ink but reversed. Hamilton's going for the Viagra. - Yeah, which is, what did you do to it? - 1,000 milligrams of sodium nitrate. Also known as salt peter. And 1,000 milligrams of over the counter muscle relaxant. - What the heck, it's a big night. - [All] Not. - Time to get jiggy. (laughing) - You ready? You ready? Spammy's ready. Spammy's ready. - Looks like Hamilton's going into the closet. - What's in the closet? - I don't know, I didn't get that far. (muttering) (grandiose horn music) - Take a good look, little brother. Because that's as close as you're ever gonna get. - Good. - I am Zorro who makes the sign of the Z. (farting) - What was that? - Gas leak? - Begin emissions test. - I am the Ice Queen. Slippery when wet. - Ice Queen. More code do you think? - These guys are smart. - Z. - Been there, done that. - Has Zorro been a bad boy without me? - Zorro's been a very bad boy. - You know what happens when Zorro plays without me. - Feather boa? - No, Mr. Chicken. (laughing) - They're not alone. - What the heck is that? I'm Zorro-- - Mr. Chicken could be a ringleader. - Uh huh. - Mr. Chicken loves rodeo. - Mr. Chicken loves rodeo? (grunting) - Is that a real chicken? - Faster Zorro, faster. (laughing) (slurping) Faster Zorro, faster. (laughing) - Why don't you just use the remote? - No. Geez. - Yeah. - Should I call for backup? - What's happening to Zorro's face? - It's turning blue. (laughing) - Oh, now you're gonna get it. - I can hardly wait. - [All] Neither can we. - Come on. What's wrong? - It's, oh no. - No, what do you mean no, huh? - Well, it's not me. It's Spammy. - Wait a minute, no Spammy? - No Spammy. - No whammy. - Would somebody tell me what the hell's going on? - Come on, Zorro, where the hell is Spammy? - Spammy doesn't want to come out and play, OK? (laughing) - What's wrong with you? - Oh, what's wrong with me? Oh, gee, maybe if you farted a few more times, I could really get excited. (laughing) - That's it, I'm out of here with your blue face, buck teeth, lip, Zorro who makes the sign with the. - You. I can fix this. (laughing) - What the hell was that all about? - Who cares? ♫ Spammy, how I love ya, how I love ya ♫ My dear old Spammy - Have this analyzed. Get me everything you know about chickens. Get me everything you know about rodeos. What are you doing here? All right. Tell me everything you know about cowboys. - Well, there are all kind of cowboys. You got your Texas cowboys that are kind of like the original real cowboys. And then you got your Oklahoma cowboys, and those guys would like to be Texas cowboys, but they just can't get it right. Well, then you got old west of Colorado cowboys and Nevada cowboys, more like mountain cowboys, they listen to country and western music, but it's more like a western thing instead of a country thing. And they like to think they're a little bit different, but really they're not. And then you got your southern cowboys and it's just too hot down there to really rodeo right so they never-- - All right. Enough. - Blast. - Your eyelids are very heavy. When I snap my fingers-- - Just in on the Driscoll case. The report came back clean. The ingredients on Scrunch are harmless. We're safe, sir. - Just like the PEZ epidemic in the '80s. Useless information. If you need me, I'll be in the think tank. - PEZ again? - Exactly how much pain is involved? - It depends on the kind of chicken. - Demonstrate, please. - Are you OK, sir? - Fine, fine. Why don't you agents try it? Hurts like hell, doesn't it? - One invention down. And one to go. The wonder wand. - What are you looking at? - Nothing, sir. You haven't slept in three weeks. (smacking, grunting) - Oh, young Thomas Edison. - No Cadillac Jack today? - No, he's out cruising garage sales for oscillators. What'll it be today? Ray guns or plutonium? - Well, actually, I have a list. - Mohair, Cooley, over. (snoring) Mohair, Cooley, over. Mohair, Cooley, wake the hell up. - Morning, Agent Cooley. - 55 millimeter. Or would you like a 75? - 75. - OK. Would you like a helmet with that? - Yeah. - OK. What about a teddy bear? - No teddy bears. - OK. Anything else? - Yeah, an ignition timer. - Oh, yeah. There we are. - And a spool of detonating wire. - Just for you. OK, there you go. - Global positioning device. - Oh, sorry. You'll have to go to Radio Shack. They have a Tandy on sale. - OK. That's it. - OK. - You got a box? - Yeah. - OK. - OK. Here you go. - Do you have a bigger box? Thanks for the line of credit. - Oh, here's your receipt. Picnic on Sunday? - Hmm? - Would you like to take me to a picnic on Sunday? - Well-- - Then we're agreed. My address, say, one o'clock? - Mm hmm. - Then we're confirmed, I'll see you. - Kid might be a walking time bomb. - Yeah, we got our orders. - I have a date. (yelling, laughing) - So, you're the guy, huh? - Your truck's a piece of crap. - Have you ever killed anybody? - Stick 'em up. - How much money do you make after taxes? - Are you gonna marry my sister? - Are you gonna kiss her? (laughing) - Who are all these kids? - They're mine. Just kidding. They're all a part of the Cadillac Jack collection and I'm the ringleader. So, you ready for the country tour? - Ready. - Have her home by dawn, or else. - Yes, sir. - Hey kids, want to play baseball, huh? Come on, come on, come on. (laughing) - The adventure begins. (sweet piano music) ♫ I thought I had it all figured out ♫ I knew what life was all about ♫ I set my sights, my course was laid ♫ But the tide quickly turned and now I'm so afraid ♫ There you are ♫ And I didn't even know I needed you ♫ There you are ♫ After all the things life has put me through ♫ You're the missing part ♫ Of my empty heart ♫ I opened up my eyes and there you are - [Woman] Your four minute lunch break is now over. Repeat, your four minute lunch break is now over. - A word with you, intern. - What can I do for you, Spammy? (laughing) - Yeah, yeah, that's very, very funny. So, that's how you did it, huh? When the village idiot borrowed my car keys to wash my car, huh? You know, I could have you arrested for what you did. - Yeah, yeah same way you stole my invention. - Stole your invention, huh? Well, guess what? Your invention doesn't work. All right, listen up, all you interns. Business 101. I sent it out to six labs. Six samples, it all came out the same. You're nothing but a crank kid with a chemistry set. Face it, kid, you hit rock bottom. There's nowhere to go. - Not that I, I ran-- - Yeah, but we don't pay you for junk like this. - No, actually, you don't pay us at all. - Yeah, yeah right, whatever. The point is, and don't you have some place to go? Hit the road, Jack. You've got 30 minutes to get downstairs, load up your junk into that junky truck and hit the road, OK? Capisce? 30 minutes to get out of dodge. You know, kid, we could have worked together, me and you. You know, we could have been a team, you know, but no, you had to back stab me. - You stole my invention. - Yeah, it's my job to steal, OK? I'm the top salesman. - You know, you're all just a bunch of suck ups. - You know Bryce, I really need this job. Nobody else will hire me. - I know Pete. Look, here. As long as you keep that, Hamilton will never fire you. - The Hamilton tapes. Man, I really owe ya. - I'm gonna miss this place. - Yeah. - Oh, yes. - Miss Perez, have you seen Miss Monahan today? - No, she took Mr. McDuff to his doctor's appointment this morning. - Here. Can you give her that? Make sure she gets it, it's for Mr. McDuff. And have her follow the instructions on there. - What is this, more poison? - No, not this time, that's magic. - Magic. - Thanks for the information. Excuse me, sir. The Driscoll kid was fired, closed all his bank accounts. - How much was in there? - $17 and 32 cents. - Dear Uncle Albert. This is it, new and improved Scrunch, my memory enhancer that really works. - First they steal his ideas, then they fire him. What would you do? - Think, think, think. (knocking) (ominous music) - Cooley, Mohair, found these in the trash bin at McDuff Ice. Lab works confirm, the boy's fingerprints are all over them. - What are they? - Blueprints of some kind. - Look, here, handwriting. What does it say? - Wander wound? - Wanda one. - I think it says wonder wand. - Wonder wand. Sounds harmless enough. Get this over to our electrical boys in engineering. - Yes, sir. - And if they come back empty handed, sir? - Then we've got nothing on the kid. - Then you'll drop this vendetta against his father, sir? - You're out of line, Agent. - Am I? - All right, Doctor, I'll make a deal with you. If whatever this is comes back clean, then we'll drop the Driscoll case. Can't spend the rest of my life chasing a one armed man. (old fashioned music) - The secret to this tea is in the brewing process. You don't steep the tea. You let the tea settle. You let the purified water breathe in the essence of the tea. - Maybe this was a mistake. - Nothing in life is a mistake, son. - No, maybe I was a mistake. - Not true. - Everything I do, everything I touch-- - Learning how to live is an experiment, too, son. - You know, the thing is, Dad-- - You don't want to become like your eccentric old man. Does your mother ever talk about me? - Only in the past tense. - Well, maybe it's better this way. What with the FBI and the CIA. You know. You're not here to complain. You're here to ask a question. - Well, actually. - When was the last time, three years ago? You wanted that hydrogen helium formula. - But now I'm on to some really great things, Dad. I've got this oxygenated freeze dried memory enhancer and I've got this thing called the wonder wand. You know, I remember as a kid, that you were playing around with some similar experiments. Didn't you almost give your secrets to the government? - You realize where this might take you? - I gotta try, Dad. Just like you, I was born to be an inventor. - We think the FDA is a secret organization. - What about the CIA? - We think they're a secret organization, too. - OK, get on it. Start with the yellow pages. - We're on it. - We're on it. - Bryce as a baby. (laughing) Joey as a baby. Even then, he looked old for his age. Must be the beard. And I look at you after that damn brain tumor, singing to the trees and dancing with the bushes. Maybe there isn't nothing to worry about. Maybe life just sort of floats by, pulling folks like us with it. - So what is the missing ingredient? - Well, I think it's in the compression rate. My computer tests-- - Forget about computers. Forget about millennial thinking. Sometimes the answer lies in the basics, in the foundations of invention. (buzzing) - Bryce. He's gone ballistic. - Let's hurry. (dramatic music) I got my eye on the alley. (engine starting) - Wonderful day to water. - Is there a Pete here? Is there a Pete here? You have a message, is it real? - Is it? - Oh my God. I warned Joey. Evacuate the building, incoming, incoming. Evacuate the building, evacuate the building. - Hello? Mr. McDuff? Hello? - Who's there? - It's a bomb, it's a bomb, we need to evacuate the building. It's a bomb. Oh, Miss Monahan, have you seen Mr. McDuff? - No, he's at home. Doctor's orders since they changed his medication. What's going on? - There's a bomb, don't you see? - I don't understand. - We need to evacuate. - Are you drunk again? - It's a bomb, he built a bomb. - Who, that basement boy? That lazy boy? - His name is Bryce. - What brings you here? - Well, sir, I need to take you somewhere. I need you to come with me now. - Geez. - How was it in there? - It's a living hell, Cooley. - What did you see? - The kid lives like a pig. - Let's take a look. (chattering, yelling) - Ah, another one of those. I just finished the last one from Miss Monahan's supply. - Well, I worked out the bugs on that. (phone ringing) - McDuff here. Well, yes, he's standing right here in front of me. Well, I don't know, I'll ask him. Bryce, where were you planning to take me today? - The ice pond, sir. I have a feeling you'll get a real bang out of this. - We just got a call. A bomb threat at McDuff Ice. Level two, we can't verify. - Get Cooley and Mohair on it now. (yelling, chattering) - New flavor, very good. - What's seven times 12? - 84. - Who shot Alexander Hamilton? - The vice president of the United States, Aaron Burr. And it cost him the presidency, even though Hamilton cheated. - Yes. - Kid's got a bomb and a hostage. - Don't just stand here. There's nothing to be afraid of. Who are you? - I'm Bryce's mother. - I'm Bryce's boss. - Mr. Hamilton. I have a delivery for you, sir. - It's a bomb. (yelling) (dramatic music) - Read the note. - Who's it from? - Dear Mr. Hamilton, we'll see you at the ice pond. Bryce Driscoll and Mr. McDuff. - The ice pond? - It's an ice skating arena, sir. - This is it, Mr. McDuff. The ice pond, the big one. (chattering) (dramatic music) - This just in, wonder wand report. - I don't see the word bomb anywhere in this report. - It isn't a bomb. - Kid and an old man, did you see 'em come in here? - Sure, kid offered me 20 bucks if I let him on the main ice rink. I sent him down to lower level practice rink instead. - Was he carrying anything? - Yeah, come to think of it, he was. Gadget, big one. - Just what we've been looking for. - Kid's making his move. - No big bang? - No. - What have I done? I put Mohair on the job. Get me his earpiece. We have to call this thing off before anyone gets hurt. (dramatic music) Mohair, Cooley, cancel pursuit. I repeat, Mohair, Cooley, cancel pursuit. By God, I hope they can hear me. - I can't get through, there's interference, sir. It sounds like there's a Zamboni on the ice. - Possible mafia? - You believe in Scrunch, sir? - Tastes good, and my mind is clear as a bell. - Then trust me on this one. - Elevator. - I want a helicopter on the pad in five minutes. - We don't have a helicopter, sir. - We don't even have a pad, sir. - Damn. - What in God's creation? - It's the future of McDuff Ice. I call it the wonder wand. (zapping) - What the hell was that? - We've detected a cryogenic burst at the ice arena. - Do you realize what you've done? - Apparently, the kid's invented some sort of cryogenics generator. - Freeze. - Freeze. OK, Mr. Driscoll, take your finger off the doomsday weapon. - Nice and easy, kid. We don't want to have to use you as target practice. - Mohair, Cooley, this is an order, stand down. - The transmission went through, sir. - Huh? - Don't do it, son. - Bryce, don't do it. All that talk about revenge, it was just talk. - Come on, kid, you've gone way too far with this, huh? All right, everybody, let's go back to work. - Hey, Hamilton. Why don't you set the record straight and tell everybody what really happened? - Yeah, fat chance. - Tell them, Hamilton, before somebody really gets hurt. - You're either in or you're out, Bernie. - Just this once, Bernie, make up your own mind. (chattering) - Who's the man, Bernie? Who's the man, Bernie? Who's the man, come on, huh? - I'm the man. Bernie Hill is the man. (applause) - You are the man. - And I admit, I stole the kid's invention with him. - Shut up, Bernie. - You shut up for a change. (applause) - Agent Cooley, FBI. - Agent Mohair, nothing to see here. - What we're seeing here is the beginning of a new ice age. Well, what are you all waiting for? Grab your skates and let's go. Everybody except Hamilton. And I think you're fired. (tweeting) (applause) (tapping) - Mohair, Cooley, are you listening? Give the kid a job. - Bryce Driscoll. May I have a word with you, please? - What about? Is this about my invention or is it about my father? - It's about you. On behalf of the state department, we'd like to offer you a job in cryogenic research. - No thanks. I think my future's with McDuff Ice. - Think about it, kid. In less than 10 years, you can freeze dry great scientist, your friends, even your family. - Then what? - Beats me. Kid didn't go for it. - What? You know what that means? - We think you need a good ass kicking, sir. (grunting) - [Director] That was interesting. Oh, good, there. - You know, the difference between us and the real Romeo and Juliet is that they died, and I don't think that's gonna happen to us any time soon, do you? - Not unless you invited any emus to the party. - Where do you want the soda pop at? - Over there in the corner's fine. - The caterer's late. - It's OK, don't worry about it. - You have calls on lines six, seven, and eight. - All right, take a message. - Stop bothering him. Don't you worry, boss, this party doesn't start for two hours. - Thanks, Helga. - The marketing campaign starts tomorrow. - Yeah, all right, Bernie. He's the new head of marketing. (laughing) Hey. - Little brother. How does it feel to be el presidente? - Well, I couldn't do it without my head of sales. And distribution. - You're the man. - Drink up. - Hey, buddy, listen to that. ♫ You and I wonder why there are birds and butterflies ♫ You look at me and I can see ♫ My fantasy come true - Bryce, I'm rehearsing for my comeback. - That's nice, Uncle Albert, that's real nice. - John, let's take it from here. ♫ You and I were always meant to be (piano music) - The new president of McDuff Ice be showing up in his limousine any minute now. - His first day, they should have hired a bed. - I have an even better surprise. You'll never guess who came in and filled out a job application yesterday. - Tyler Driscoll? Dad? Dad? (laughing) I never thought I'd see you again. - I don't know what you boys did, or how you did it, but I can live my life in the open again. (laughing) (uplifting music) - Here he comes. Isn't life beautiful? - It sure is. - Yeah. (heartfelt piano music) ♫ I thought I had it all figured out ♫ I knew what life was all about ♫ I set my sights, my course was laid ♫ But the tide quickly turned and now I'm so afraid ♫ There you are ♫ And I didn't even know I needed you ♫ There you are ♫ After all the things life has put me through ♫ You're the missing part ♫ Of my empty heart ♫ I opened up my eyes and there you are ♫ I didn't know that - OK. So we all know that you're foreign nationals. How did you get in this country? - We're from the moose lodge. - Sir, sir, let's go. (growling)
