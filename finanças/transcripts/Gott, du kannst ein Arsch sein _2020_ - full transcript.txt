Drive! - Drive! - I'm trying You can't fuck a motherfucker. ONE WEEK EARLIER GRADUATION PARTY THEODOR FONTANE REALSCHULE Right! It's all over for the parents and teachers. Thanks for being here. - And now we're going to party... - Really hard! Semmel, I'll have to take your dope away when I join the police. For giving it to me then. - Really gonna join the police? - Sure. What you gonna do? No idea. Chill for now. And then earn a load of cash. How do you tell a great love story when you know it's about to end? It's best to start like with any other story. They say the journey is its own reward. The things that we do, every day. But sometimes the journey is so good, you forget about the destination. GOD, YOU'RE SUCH A PRICK! This would be a great moment, right? I have the house to myself. My parents have gone to work. Come on! - Nele and Semmel have done it. - Right... If they have, we have to! You said you'd be ready in two years. - Wait. - Don't change the subject. Date? - Sunday. - And then? We'll have been together two years. And I've booked us a hotel room. - We'll be on our class trip to Paris. - The hotel is in Paris. Paris! The city of love. - It's a romantic hotel. - "Des Saintes Pierres." We're in a hostel with the others. - It doesn't even have Wi-Fi. - Why do you need Wi-Fi? Want to watch a tutorial before we do it? - Are you serious? - Yes! - Did you plan the whole thing? - Yes. You know I'm good at planning. Awesome. It's going to be great. It's going to be great! It's a little bit big. Maybe I've lost weight. - Do you have the shirt in XS too? - Steffi, this is the police not H&M. Be glad. When I started out the uniforms were green. - That looked crappy. - Oh, God! Sorry, I... Steffi, can I have a moment? You needn't bother about the uniform for now. Because of the size? - No problem. I can wear an S. - No. You failed the medical. - What? - They say you're not fit for service. I... don't understand. Oh, right... I see! They took a blood sample after the graduation party. There might have been some blood in the alcohol. Okay, then... I'll just give another sample. This time without the alcohol. You'll get an email with information. Discuss it with your parents. - Yes. - Right... I'm in a rush. It's my sister's birthday. - We're going to the circus. - Have fun. - Thanks. Have a good day. - Yeah. A round of applause for our wonderful Alice, the snake woman. And now... Now we present the highlight. He's been riding motorbikes since he was four. I know. That's because I'm his dad. Bring in the Globe of Death! No one rides a motorbike like he does. This circus will show you things you've never seen before. And now... thunderous applause for Steve Matanola! Applause! The Loop of Death ridden by my son, Steve Matanola! A truly unique performance! Fifteen minutes for a scenery change and then part two of the show. Go on, ask him. Don't you dare? - Autograph for my little sister? - Sure. - One for you, too? - No, thanks. So, did you like it? Then come by another time. Tomorrow or the next day. Actually... we can't. I have horseback riding class tomorrow. And the next day Steffi is in Paris. And... I can't cancel my riding lesson, and... - Steffi planned it ages ago... - The second half is about to start. - OK. - Come on. - Cool. - Looks good. You happy? Yes. After the show you can ride the elephant. - I hate clowns. - Me too. Like the plague. What's oncology? - Why? - There's a problem with my medical. It's because of the alcohol, right? Oncology... - Give a big hand to our two clowns... - Damn! Oncology... It's a small-cell bronchial carcinoma. Extremely aggressive. It has already spread. There's no nice way to say this. We can keep the symptoms in check and delay the progression, but... there is no cure. But she can live with it? No. It's terminal. I'm so sorry. It can't be. Are there any... tests that we... If that's true... then how long... If we start with the chemotherapy now, maybe until Christmas. Christmas? This... This Christmas? But that... I mean... I feel fine. How... How is that possible? You may feel well for weeks, Ms. Pape. - Or you may feel it tomorrow. - Please call her by her first name. She's still a child. Steffi, this... All this is hard to comprehend. I can't explain it any better. But I promise you we will do everything we can... to... Oh, my... What are you doing? I'm packing. - Why are you packing? - For our graduation trip. Steffi, you can't go on the trip. You have to have chemo. That's my decision, isn't it? - No. - Yes, it is! I'm packing, and then I'll get on the coach. Just like normal. Everything will be normal. Frank, could you come upstairs, please? Mom wants to stop me from going to Paris. - I can do the chemo afterwards. - She has to start it right away. The earlier the better. I really don't know if you can go. Maybe we should ask the doctor. But you heard the doctor. She could suddenly be in pain, terrible pain. - Sweetie, I'm not trying to upset you. - I am going! Frank? Steffi, you're not going to Paris. You'll get your money and passport back when you come to senses. What a bitch. You're such a stupid bitch! Come with me? I want to show you something. - You bought it? - Of course. I promised you. Cool! Move the lever to P. And now start the engine. It works! I'll have it overhauled and painted for you. Then you do chemo, and then you get your license. Okay? Yes, and if I don't make it... - Lola can have it. - No. You do chemo, and then you get your license and then we drive to Paris together. I'm so scared, Dad. You do chemo, then we drive to Paris together. Okay? Was stuck to the door. What's this? A threat... Something about our license... They want to close us down for two days to do checks. Those jerks! Art is being trampled underfoot, you know? You should submit your application on time. Of course. You're the smart one here. Well... What's been up with you recently? I'm fine. Fine? So much the better. Let's clean up here and then go out partying tonight. I'll get dolled up. All this here... You know. There you are at last! Why haven't you been in touch? - Where's your suitcase? - I can't come. You kidding? - Why? - I have to go to the hospital. - I'll stay here. - No. No! It's just some kind of therapy. - What kind of therapy? - Just some therapy. - Dude, get on the coach. - Have fun. It's gonna be amazing. You and I were gonna be amazing. On Sunday. Go on. Get on the bus before the guys lose it. - Yeah? - Yes! Everything all right? - What happened? - Please be patient. A person on the tracks. - Why don't you just say "suicide"? - In any case, this could take a while. - You? - Yes. Why... You've seen anything? Someone committed suicide. No one committed suicide. - Did you want to kill yourself? - No. Why are you here then? And you? Weren't you going to Paris? - You remember that. - Yes. - Paris is cool. - My mom won't let me go. She took my money and passport. Got a car? - I don't even have a license. - And a car? Yes. Then let's go. - Pretty cool wheels. - I'm Steffi, by the way. Hope we don't get confused. I'm Steve. Maybe I'll just call you Bumpkin, Bumpkin. Sure... Suicide. - Give me ten minutes. - Five minutes. - Bumpkin. - Ten minutes, Suicide. She's becoming a real fan. Thanks for driving me. - It's the right thing to do. - It is? You have a car, I have time. Fan belt. My dad's gonna fix it for me. He's a mechanic? A pastor. When was it last anointed with oil? You'd best drive to Hamburg first. Then take the A1 to Recklinghausen. A pee break at the Grundberg lake. - We can eat before Bremen. - You like planning. - Then things work out. - Not this time. I have to pee now. Well, then... Can cows be ridden? - Not those ones. - Why not? Because they're traumatized now. You mean cause they saw a python? Cows are scared of earthworms, you know. - Wash your hands. - Cookies! One. No pissy hands in the packet. That's disgusting! Give me those cookies! Spit it out! Your next suicide attempt? Death by cookies? You still haven't told me if you wanted to kill yourself... Oh, shut up! - Let's drive. - You're the driver. Precisely. You've reached Steffi's voicemail. Please leave... I've had enough. I'm going to call the police. Wait. Let's think first. What is there to think about? Steffi is gone. - I'll go look in the stable. - No point. - She's on her way to Paris. - What? In the pickup. - But she can't drive yet. - He's driving her. - Who? - The motorbike rider from the circus. - Lola, go upstairs a moment, please. - Okay. Frank... She could collapse at any moment. - She's supposed to go to the hospital. - But she doesn't want to. - She's on the road with that circus guy! - Yeah... - She's 16 years old. - Eva, it's her life. - Screw you! - She's my daughter too! - You think I'm not worried? - Then act like it! How? Get hysterical? Panic? Do excuse me! You're Mr. Pastoral Care. And I'm the stupid hysterical cow. Maybe because I just found out my child's dying? Okay, I'll drive after her. - To Paris? - No, I'll catch up with her. How? I'll take the fastest route, check rest stops. Okay. I'll pack a few things quickly. Please don't tell her I told you. You stay here. Hold down the fort. I'll call Grandma. You're such a big girl. - I have to pee. - Why didn't you go before? - I didn't have to then. - How tragic, Bumpkin. You're a slave to your bladder. - You had to pee just now. - I didn't have to. - I wanted to. - Yeah, right. Yes. I have my body under control. You don't have yours under control. And so you don't have your life under control either. Can we keep our mouths shut until we get to Paris? Anyway... You have your life under control? - This morning you... - Aren't we keeping our mouths shut? I'm doing you a favor and you're annoying me! I'm annoying you? I think your life annoys you. Always on the move. Riding in circles. Bossy dad. And your mom? - Leave her be! - Who is she? The trapeze artist? The snake woman? Steve? Steve! Hey, Steve! Steve, what the hell is this? Fuck! - Excuse me, heading to Paris? - No. Damn it, I'm such an idiot! - Where do you want to go? - To Paris. - Come on. - Really? Not Paris. But you can't stay here. Come to my work. I'll take you to the bus in the morning. Come on. - Have you seen my daughter? - She went with Tammy an hour ago. - Tammy? She was with a man. - She's no man. A lady with tattoos. Works in a dive in Brinkum. You can't miss it. It's the only bar there. Thanks. What d'you want to drink? I have no money. Look, I have pretty deep pockets. - What's this? - Vitamins. Minerals. And some liquid disinfectant. - Can I have another? - You sure? - It's not good for your liver. - Who cares. I have cancer. Incurable. Hey. Have you seen a girl? Blonde ponytail, white jacket, about this tall. Tammy, Brinkum. She was hitchhiking. Tammy picked her up. She works in a bar in Brinkum. Thanks. Boy, it's a small world. The tattoos? They're my life. Look here. My mom. My first great love. An asshole. These are the nicest. Like an angel. They're eagle feathers. Look at them properly. The eagle is my spirit animal. It protects and oversees me on my journey. What journey? Life. Native Americans don't get sad when one of them dies, you know. They even celebrate it. Because it's just the next phase. The deceased gets on his horse and rides to the next adventure. That's nice. How long's it take to get a tattoo? Is it starting? GOD... At least I don't have to worry how it will look when I'm old. It's locked. - It can't be true! - Eva! Someone must have seen her. You crazy? Know how late it is? I'm looking for my daughter. Could you open up? No, we're trying to sleep, for God's sake! It's closed. Are you cold? - Should I turn the heater on? - Yes. - Okay. - No. I don't care. I don't want to be here. I want to be at home. With my healthy daughters. I want to cuddle them. I want Steffi to get married. I want her to dance. And to ride. I want... I want to argue with her. What do you say to people when their child dies? "Inscrutable are the ways of God?" I don't talk much. It's... Anything you say can easily sound insincere, and... Why don't you give the truth a try? How sick is your God to take a child before its parents? I... I want to die before my children! Is that too much to ask of your shitty God? Thank you, God, for giving me this shitty cancer so that I could get to know Tammy! And thank you for sending this wonderful girl to our dump of a town! - Thank you! - Thank you! Is it the cancer? No, it's the tequila. - Look, Tammy! - Hey! That's mine! Tammy, that's the pickup! - What? - Yes! The jerk who left you behind? Wait! Wait... - Hey, pal! - Wait. I'll handle this. Hey, you loser! - Coward. Traitor! - Give it to him. - Get in. - Is that it? - Sorry. - "Sorry." - The keys. - I'll take you to Paris. - Keys! - You can't even drive. How do I know I can trust you? Shit! Listen, asshole. Don't leave her side. And if she's in pain take her to a hospital at once. - You got that? - Nothing's going to happen. Don't screw this up. Or you'll die before her. - I promise you that. - What's she talking about? - You don't know? - What? I have cancer. Can we go now? Don't screw it up, dude. For later. Thanks. For everything. Don't forget to invite me to your funeral. Now get lost. Go. Go. Hey, you two. God can't explain it either. I always believed that everyone would be together in the end. In heaven. Or somewhere like that. And you don't believe that anymore? Believing isn't enough for me anymore. Now that this has happened to Steffi... I have to know. - Can you understand? - Yes. But I don't know. I don't even know... how to avoid going crazy for Lola's sake. I just don't know. Native Americans say there are four kinds of love. The first is our love for our fellow humans. The second is our love for one particular person. The third is for a person we wish to have and hold for all time. The fourth is loving someone so much that we only want them to be well and happy, no matter what role we play in all that. Hey, Fabi! I'm on my way over to meet you. Your mom called. She... She told me how sick you are. We can discuss that when I get there. - Aren't you happy I'm coming? - No. Yes... I... I don't know. I... - I'll come to the hotel like we agreed. - Okay. We're not on the right track. Steve, what the hell? A brief stop-off. You'll like it. - What a stupid idea, Suicide! - Trust me, Bumpkin. - Five minutes. - Okay. What now? The sea? - Don't you want to see it? - I want to see Paris, and no stupid sea! All cancer patients want to go to the sea. Bullshit! Come on. Steve! Steffi! Are you all right? I don't want to die. I don't want to die! Does it hurt? Not yet. How do you know this place? - We've put on shows everywhere. - In all of Europe? The summer in Germany and Holland. Winters in France, Portugal, Italy, etc. - Why? - For the elephant's sake. - Yeah, the elephant. - If it's too cold, its ears freeze off. Really? - Have you ever seen snow? - No. - No? Not even on vacation or anything? - What vacation? My mom always talked about snow. - The snake lady? - Bullshit. My mom's dead. She killed herself when I was thirteen. Thirteen! How... Come on. Stupid elephant! They hardly make any money anyway. - You should have brought gas money. - I thought you had money. They'll get their money. Look. He has security cameras. They'll record the license number and send a bill. And the police will get involved. Just don't snitch on me. - It doesn't matter for you anyway. - Thanks. I mean... They don't put girls in prison. I'll distract him. You fill up. When you're done, get in and we leave. - Hi. - Hello. You're out of wiper blades. - And in the storeroom? - It's not even raining. But they squeak every time I want to clean the windshield. And my missus's jabbering and nagging on top of it. You should stop her mouth. That's what I always do. The wiper blades? Honey, what you doing? - I'm starving. - Yeah, but... - She's got you by the balls. - Listen. We'll pay later. We filled up, number 3. You have our license number. I'm a police officer. It's okay. I told you I won't steal. Have a nice day. - Bravo! - Right... You two got real unlucky this time. Do that at your average gas station and the punishment ain't so bad. But at Jupp's gas station it's different. I've had enough of this shit! Here, Uncle Jupp takes care of things himself. Run! I'm Steffi Pape. I'll pay you back, I promise. I don't steal but... I have to go to Paris... What are you doing? Come on! - You think you can fuck a motherfucker? - Drive! Drive! - Drive! - I'm trying! Go on! - Drive! - You can't fuck a motherfucker! Step on it! He's after us! Little bastards! Watch out! Faster. Fuckheads! Shit! I can't brake! You fuckers! You fuckers! - We flew at least ten meters! - No, more like 20! It's a new circus act. The flying fuckers! Three cheers to the flying fuckers! You're an amazing driver! Hurt yourself, right? I'm okay. Maybe a little wound on my butt. - What? - You cut your butt, halibut. That's how it is. I cut my butt, halibut! Does it start with a one? A two? A three? If you keep talking, I'll remember nothing. A four? A five? - Got a memory device, maybe? - A memory device? - Maybe you put it in your phone? - No. - Call someone who knows the number? - No. Oh, God. - Forgot your PIN? - Yeah. Usually I'd know it in my sleep. - Are we moving on? - We eat dinner punctually. - Come on, you have one more try. - I know. - Or we'll pay in cash. - Fine. That'll be 103 euros and 27 cents. I don't have that. It's either 65 or 56 at the end. Oh, shit! He doesn't even know where the card reader is. It's 56. So, do a bank transfer or bring cash by, yeah? Pay within seven days or I send the boys in blue. Okay, that's enough. I'm not usually that forgetful. Hey there? - Thank you. - Pleasure! Jesus! I'm wondering what I'll miss most of all. About life? I don't know whether... I'll miss the things I liked or the things I never did. If you mostly missed the things you'd never done that'd be a real punishment, right? - Right? - Yeah. Maybe it's like this... If you go to hell, you miss the things you never did. And if you go to heaven you don't miss anything. At the moment I'm experiencing stuff I didn't even know I could miss. I still have some time. If I go to hell, I'll miss snow. Take the next exit. The unplanned stops have been the best so far, right? I'm all for excitement, but smashing a window? This is trespassing. - At least tell me what we're doing here. - Hang on... Come on. Watch out! Between your legs, then hold on tight. Now close your legs and hold on! Yes! Very good! Keep going! Good! Yes! That's right! I can't sit like this anymore. - Why not? - Looks like I got some glass in my ass. - Glass in your ass? - Yes. That guy shoved me into his refrigerator. - What now? - I can't bear it any longer. Watch out. - Sorry. - Because of my cancer? Doesn't matter now. That tastes disgusting! I have to get this glass out. - And who's going to pay? - I have an idea. It's show time, Bumpkin. So, you have Room 101, our honeymoon suite with whirlpool. Our last-minute special offer at 567 euros. Breakfast is between 7:00 and 10:00 and the spa is open until 9:00 p.m. Fine. Then I just need your credit card. - We will charge it... - Honey! This keeps happening at the moment. Nausea, vomiting. If she doesn't lie down quickly she might faint. Yes. Thank you. Thanks a lot. - I'll bring my credit card in a moment. - Okay. - She bought it! - Sure did! Right. How are we going to do this? I mean my ass, you know? I mean the glass. Yes, I know. Soften the wounds in the tub and then I'll dig the splinters out. Sounds like a plan. I'M DOING FINE! - And? Does it taste good? - Nah. In Westerns they drink whiskey before removing a bullet. - Do you know what you're doing? - My mom's a veterinarian. What you doing? This bath is medical, not for fun. It's actually pretty cool here. I mean... - Forget Paris. - No. If I don't go to Paris, I'll die a virgin. A virgin? What does that have to do... - You wanted your first time in Paris? - Well done, Sherlock. - What do you think? - "God, you're such a prick." God, this girl you're calling home to you is a virgin. But she is not unsullied. Look. A message from Steffi. - Where is she? Looks like a hotel. - We're going to find out. Tracking service... There! No more data protection demos for me. Why did you want to be a police officer? I wanted to make a difference in the world. A difference? Yes. To people's lives. Not locking them up or anything. Do you miss your mom? No. Did you want... The railroad tracks... - You... - Did I want to do what she did? My mom had depression. I'm in a bad phase. I was in a bad phase. Right. Off with the undies. I haven't even started yet. - This is really it? - Big Brother is never wrong. No, there are no minors staying here currently. There aren't? - Then what's this? - The honeymoon suite. The pregnant lady. - Who's pregnant? - I have it here. Mrs. Matanola. Well, the future Mrs. Mata... What are you saying? Room 101. - What are you doing? - Calling the police. The police? Hang on. I understand that you're upset, but... I'm a pastor and I can explain. No police. Thank you. You're just rummaging around now. No! There's a piece in there somewhere. Mom? How... - Steffi! - Hi. I'm Steve. - What... - I'm getting glass out of his butt. - Could you... - Yes. One moment. I told you there was a piece in there. - Cheers, then. - Cheers. You look different. I feel different. That's good. Mom! My little Mommy. I'm sorry. Me too. I... I... I didn't want to get on your case. I love you so much. I love you too. There you are, vagabond. I'm on the way to Paris. - What are you doing? - Me? Just chilling out. I see. - You still there? - Listen... How about we give the stupid elephant away? Then we could spend a winter in Germany. You been drinking? Mom wanted me to learn snowboarding, remember? Okay. You have been drinking. I haven't been drinking. That's strange. I'm boozing and you're the one talking shit. Show tomorrow, yeah? 6:00 p.m. Be on time. 6:00 p.m., you hear? On time. Gotta go. Okay. - Is she all right? - Yes. But... Frank... you won't like this. - She has a tattoo. - She has a tatt... What kind of tattoo? "God, you're such a prick." - You're making fun of me. - And the boy is half naked! - What boy? - Steve, from the circus. He's really... He's really good-looking! - Have you taken something? - No. This way! Steffi? Steffi? Whiskey? Eva? - We have to follow her right away. - I thought you wanted to let her be. - I didn't know she was having orgies! - Don't worry. - He only had... - What? ...pieces of glass in his ass! She's definitely taken something. - Glass in the ass! - Steffi! - We need a head start. - Then hurry. - Can't we knock out the car somehow? - How? We can't even get inside. Oh, Dad, really? Come on. Yes, I get that. I'm not stupid. I just don't understand why... Hung up! Right... We have to get a new set of keys made. They refuse to hot-wire it. Can you tell me what you took? I'm just relieved, Frank. She looked so... happy. And she loves me. - What does your ass have to say? - It says... "I'm glad the glass is out. Too bad about all that rummaging." Ungrateful ass! Think they'll follow us? My parents aren't good at giving up. You don't happen to be going to Paris? Okay. Thank you. - Here we are then. - Better than waiting until tomorrow. - If we get a ride. - Yes. If we get a ride. Oh, hello. Fabi? No word about the naked boy. Steffi can tell him that herself. Hello. Hello, Fabi. Have you heard from Steffi? She called and we're meeting in the hotel as planned. Okay, you do as you planned then send me a text and we'll join you. But... Why did you think we were coming to Paris? How exactly do you want to do it? How is it supposed to go down? I don't know. We... We're in a hotel and we... We have a room. Okay, then... just do your thing, Fabi. But send us the hotel's address. Have fun, yeah? - My most embarrassing moment ever. - Yeah. But that was a sign. Maybe we should just let her be. "Paris!" That's a sign! - Excuse me? - Yeah? - Are you going to Paris? - What if I am? - What will you do in Paris? - I'm meeting Fabi in a hotel. You can drop me off at a subway station. - I will find my way. - Yeah, right. I'll take you. It's called the Metro, by the way. The subway in Paris is called the Metro, Bumpkin. And what will you do, Suicide? I have a show this evening. I can't hang around. - Will we meet again? - We took care of everything. Although... there is still one unanswered question. Oh, fuck! This was a shitty idea! - Not bad for an Easy Rider. - Shut up, Bumpkin! And I wanted to say... The difference... It was you who made it. Stupid cows. Come on, Bumpkin. Fuck, my ass. Thanks. Tammy's letter. Steffi! Hi! - Who is he? - He drove me to Paris. Isn't it about time we... Here. It's just enough for one glass. To share. That's how it all started. Hi, Steve. I've been thinking about our phone call. The elephant stays. You can go. If you want to, that is. Love you. Shit! - Is it real? - Of course. What do you think? I don't know. It doesn't really seem right for you. - What's wrong? - I... I... can't do this. I'm sorry if I... if I can't be what you need me to be. You're the best boyfriend I could have had and I'm grateful that I had you. Are you breaking up with me? Is it because you... No! No. I wish you all the happiness in the world. Don't ever forget about us. Shit! Can't I even cry in peace? - Why are you still here? - Sightseeing. Paris is kind of pretty. That's the guy with glass in his ass? I thought he was interesting. Poor boy. There's a room free there now. - And I'm terribly tired. - Me too. Come on. Hi, Steve. I've been thinking about our phone call. The elephant stays. You can go. If you want to, that is. Love you. The fourth kind. The fourth kind of love is loving someone so much that we only want them to be happy. No matter what role we play. Tammy's letter. But I already knew that. Or I'd never have driven you to that hotel. That was perfect. It was all right. Do you think you can love life so much you can let it go? That's probably the key to it all. Steve? Could we say goodbye right now? When everything is so perfect? Bye, Steffi. Bye, Steve. So those were the first three days after my diagnosis. And in those three days I truly understood one thing: it doesn't matter how long your life is but how good it is. And if you want life to work out you have to love it. Not tomorrow, or a month from now, but right away, and unconditionally. Because it could suddenly be over. If a person lives too short a time The world says he is gone too soon If a person lives a good long time The world says it's time to go My girlfriend is beautiful When I got up, she went away Don't waken her until she stirs I have laid myself down in her shadow GOD, YOU'RE SUCH A PRICK! WAS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY. STEFFI DIED 296 DAYS AFTER HER DIAGNOSIS, SURROUNDED BY HER FAMILY. ON HIS FARM STEFFI'S FATHER FRANK ESTABLISHED A HOSPICE FOR FEMALE CANCER PATIENTS.
