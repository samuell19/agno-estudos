HIDDEN DIARY Audrey! Are you well? Your mother couldn't come. - A pleasantjourney? - Yes. You look wonderful. Martine Laurencin General practitioner - Everything ok? - Fine. - Is Audrey here? - Yes, she's out in the garden. What have you made for dinner? Hold on, I just finished work! - Ok, forget it. - I'll go out. I hurried things up. Had a good journey? You must be tired. No, I slept on the plane. - Longer hair suits you. - Thanks. He's a funny dog. Yes, he's young. I took your things up to your room. Thank you. Here we are... If you had told us that you were coming a little sooner we'd have taken time off. It's a miracle I managed to get away. But I have to work too. - To your visit! - Oan't you take 10 days off? No, just before I left, they gave me a great project. I'd have cancelled. I didn't want to. I wanted to see you. This is for you both. I don't take photos. Your father can have it. Is it a digital one? Yes, it's very easy to use. The definition is wonderful. I don't understand a word. You could take photos of the garden. It's beautiful. The garden's your mother. No, if you feed him, we'll never get any peace. I can't believe that... That's enough! No, Tiger, come here! Michel, you could try training him. We could have him put down too. - You can't sleep? - No. - Want a sleeping pill? - No thanks. Everything ok? I can't concentrate in my room. There's a lot of bronchitis about. I passed Granddad's house earlier. It's empty, isn't it? It's uninhabitable. I can't get anything done here. You just got here! Relax for a couple of days, then get back to your work. You always asked me to go to Granddad's with you, as if to avoid being alone with him. I took you because he wanted to see you. He was fond of you. He always asked about you. You know that. So he'd be happy to see me in his house. I couldn't come to the funeral. I really couldn't get away and I'm sorry that I wasn't with you. I've worked a lot these last two years. Sorry. This wasn't planned either. The engineerjust found a clever way to save even more water. It's a really great project. Sorry, but I need quiet. You sound like an old maid. Right, I'll get back to work. The keys are in the kitchen, the ring with Tintin's rocket. - We'll deliver tomorrow. - Thank you. You scared me! Aren't you working? Yes, but I close at seven. It's already seven? I haven't stopped. I came to see if you were comfortable. You don't waste time. - Want a coffee? - No thanks. Will you have room to work? Are you making fun? No, I'm glad to see someone living here. Even if I'd prefer to see you staying with us. Is life good? Of course. Why? I don't know. You seem like you want to avoid us. Got problems? Not at all. I came here to see you, I swear. But I have to work too, make phone calls at night... I've been in Toronto 10 years and you've never been over. If it were up to me, we'd have come long ago. If you insisted, maybe she'd fly for once. No, I don't think so. Last year, I got us tickets to go to Florence by train. At the last minute, I found her sitting next to her bag, refusing to leave. With her father's illness, even going to Bordeaux stressed her. Apart from work, nothing interests her. - You can't leave it here! - Suzanne... Don't shout. It's a delivery for me. Hello. I won't take long. I couldn't have known. It holds for you too, you know. Parking here is strictly forbidden. All right. Mind out. This is no good at all. There's no hook-up. The pipes need changing. The dishwasher was a bad idea then. It'll take years to redo it, right? It's a day's work for a plumber. I could try to help out but this needs a professional. Thank you. I'll manage. I'm sorry. Let's go. Roast pork with prunes A new school year Suzanne, thank you for the fruit. There's far too much of it for me. And I prefer to pick it before the birds gorge on it. If someone can use it... That's kind. You live in America, I hear? In Oanada. Quite a success. Do you want some sugar? No. It's nice to have family photos. I've always liked them. My parents have taken very few and I think my grandfather burnt his after his wife left. I don't know what he did. You and Louise were neighbours. Maybe you didn't talk much? We'd say hello. No one's ever told me much about her. All my mother told me is that she leftjust after a new kitchen was put in for her. That's possible. He used to spoil her so much. He loved her, I think. Do you know why she left? No. She certainly was rather distant. She was a beautiful woman. She came from a very modest background and marrying your grandfather was a wonderful opportunity for her. He'd make her outfits... You should have seen them. I often wondered what could have become of her. It was rare to see someone leave like that. "The new kitchen has been fitted. "If only he could understand me. "He refuses to let me work. I hate him for it. "Afeeling of emptiness. " "Gilles has offered me a suit, a model copied from a Dior design. " "The sky is dangerous, it makes my head spin. " "My darlings, "I've decided to go away for a while "to think..." "My loves, I'm leaving this house. I feel so bad..." "My darling children, I'm going away or a whole "to try to find a new life where we will be happy at last. " "Amother isn't necessarily happy "with the father of her children. "That doesn't mean she isn't happy with her children. " Let's see... Stuffing... A quarter pound of fatty bacon... A quarter pound of fatty bacon... Hello. Goodbye, doctor. Thank you. - I just wanted a quick word. - Oome in. - Are you well? - Yes, very well. Just a second... I just told a woman she has cancer. And I have patients with nothing who moan all day long. They're more depressing. They confide in you. It's important for them. Sometimes I get tired of all this misery. Have you managed to rest a little? A little. You look a bit off-colour. Yes, I worked late. Is it going well? Slowly. Your skin is blotchy. Do you use sunscreen? Yes, always. At your age, you should be more careful. Here. Thank you. Oome to dinner tonight. Not tonight. We're going to my brother's. I said you might come. They'd like to see you. Why don't you all come over? The least I can do is invite G?rard, right? You're impossible... "Chop half a pound of veal liver "and a quarter pound of fatty bacon. " "Put the bacon and liver in a little boiling stock. "Boil for 5 minutes. " "Chop finely and place the mixture in a mortar. " It's us! Thank you. - You're alone? - Mum's on the beach. - They're not here yet? - No. They won't be long. I just put the duck in the oven. Duck... I found an old recipe book that belonged to Louise. Really? It's a sort of diary too. Maybe I should give it to them. No, I don't think that would be a good idea. Your grandfather's death upset your mother and I don't think this is the time to remind her of Louise. - How's the shop doing? - Fine. It's a pain when people buy two ugly pairs of specs instead of one but I have loyal customers. Your friend Samira came to see me today. Really? She has two lovely daughters. Sorry. Audrey, don't move! It's so beautiful! Hurry, we'll be late for mass again! A photo! A photo, please! Oome on, children. Smile, Martine, please. Martine, please, we haven't much time. Ok, let's go. That'll do, won't it? That smells so good! It's a fairly old recipe. Does it remind you of anything? No. What's this dishwasher? - It doesn't work? - No. You messed the kitchen up to put this in? The plumbing's rotten. I can't hook it up. And you need a dishwasher just for you? I wanted to improve the kitchen. The layout is perfect. Itjust needs some modern appliances. I don't want you touching anything here. It's a hand-embroidered cloth, we can't use it. Want to hang it on a wall? Help me instead of contradicting me. Martine, O?dric got his diploma. He had good marks. The Grand Hotel has taken him on. Really? Tell me, Audrey... - Do you have someone? - Me? No. A man or a woman can blossom alone. Nonsense. You know, Audrey, I met my wife at the age of 40. For years I drifted from one affair to the next until the right person came along... And she's the right person! Until the day you're ready, when desire wins. I'd had my eye on him for years. But he was so wary of women. His mother abandoning him didn't help. Let's finish setting the table. She was brave to leave like that. It was a real scandal. Our mother left because she was heartless, not to be free. A mother doesn'tjust abandon her kids. She has to be crazy. I think she left for a man. It devastated her husband. You didn't get over it back then. Maybe. It's delicious. It's duck '? la paulus'. Here's to Audrey... for coming to see us. Thank you. Here's to you and to freedom for women... And to Paulus! We can talk normally at this table for once. As kids, we weren't allowed to say a word. Oould you at least respect Dad's memory in his own home? Say what you like elsewhere. He's not doing anything, Martine, he's not saying anything. Do you like the Grand Hotel, O?dric? Yeah. Yes, congratulations. His money helped set up your restaurant. Admit that at least. Out it out, Martine, it wasn't easy accepting that money. I only took it because the bank refused our loan. He ended up giving me a little cash. I was almost 40 then. I don't hassle you about the house. It's good Audrey's here. No one uses it otherwise. If it's empty year round, it will deteriorate. We agreed we wouldn't sell it. Maybe we could decide to do it up and rent it out. Yes, it needs a little work. Who can afford it? We can always sell the furniture. I'd rather sell the house instead! Whatever, I don't care. That's settled then. More duck, anyone? O?dric, you could bring friends here this summer. And party all night! Sorry, I have a headache. I'm going home. Martine, listen... Darling... Mum, you can'tjust leave. Enough. You're starting to get on my nerves! It's delicious, Louise. Too bad you don't cook more often. He won't let me help at the shop. He won't let me work. Soon, he won't let me speak. These models are lovely. Look. This suit is gorgeous, isn't it? Use it as inspiration. You know what I'd like, Gilles? To help at the shop, work behind the counter, receive the customers, choose the fabrics with you... Many couples run shops. I'll make this model for you. I hear that in big cities, a woman doesn't always need her husband's permission to work. Thank you. You've lost weight. Forgive me. Still no kids yet? No. This world's too harsh. I'm not brave enough. Are you afraid of being alone later? No, I've never thought of that. I hadn't thought of it either. But after Paul went away, I realized that I had my daughters and they had me and that we were strong together. It's silly. No, I understand. I'm pregnant. I'm two months gone. I'm totally lost. Only natural. It's such a weird condition. But once the baby's there, you'll wonder why you waited so long. Personally, I'd have had more if my man hadn't walked out. I wish I could be that simple. First off, I'm not simple. And why is it more complicated for you? Without my work, I'm lost. I'm horribly self-centred. And the father? We're not together. He'sjust a friend... - Is he married? - No. To be honest, I'm not made for this. And neither is he. "Night is too short. And what if I abandoned it" "This snivelling baby" A Japanese poem I came across just before leaving. It gets easier after the first months. We're hungry, Mum, we're going. All right, give me a minute or two. They're waiting. Keep in touch. Got all your things? I'd like Martine to study, to get an education. She has to learn. She's so stubborn, she can succeed. I'd like her to be free. " Women have always worked in my family, even for a pittance. Is that Dad's dress? Yes. So? You don't wear it to the beach. You don't know anything. You're mad! Don't talk to your mother like that! You hurt me. You have such a character... A character like that will take you far. What does that mean? You can study, work, fulfil yourself. It's important. You have to study, Martine. You too, G?rard, but it's easier for boys. You're a good student. You have to carry on like that. You promise? Yes. People are so disgusting. A few weeks back I found a pair of briefs. Oan you believe it? Oome in for coffee. I have decaf. Back when she was around, I never had much opportunity to come in here. That's right. She had a camera. She had even decided she wanted to be an assistant to Mr Lebedel, the photographer. The fuss that caused! She had an affair, you mean? She spent a lot of time there but no one really knew. But people talked. First, it was photography, then English lessons... A woman like that is a real plague... She was learning English? I think so. She went by bus. That wasn't done. Oan you say, "He's gone for a walk"? Of course. You can't say it! - I can. - You can't. That's not the right word. You can't say it. I'd like a word. I can't let you go to your lessons by bus. You don't trust me? I do. But my customers gossip. They're real chatterboxes. I can't lose custom because of your English lessons. I just can't. I understand. You didn't continue? No. I took up photography, more or less by chance. It's for my husband. He wants a photo for his shop. I can see why. It's hard being away from a pretty wife. Is a camera like this expensive? Yes, fairly expensive. But I can lend you one if you want. I could never accept. I can even teach you the basics. The look on your face... It was a big funeral. He was very popular. He was a good tailor. This plant matches the stone. We chose pink granite. It's brighter than black. Yes, it's more colourful. What's wrong? It's the heat. Have you called a plunger about the dishwasher? A plumber, you mean. He's busy until next week. That's the problem. Everything's so complicated. And they complain about the Poles! What Poles? It's funny, this old love of yours for kitchen things. You always said technical progress had helped to liberate women. You had all the housewife's paraphernalia. You used to call it your dowry. I may have it stored away somewhere. When Granddad died, did Louise get in touch? What are you saying? Hold on. We'll put them on this. It's handier. She could have... What? Oome back. That's absurd! Didn't you find anything in the house? Your grandfather threw her things out when she left. Audrey, you're annoying me. Why bring this up again? Thanks. I've found an exercise book, with rough copies of letters and things she wrote about herself, about you, about her life... Really? - Do you want to see it? - No. You're not interested? No, but I think Evelyne will love it. I found it in the kitchen, behind a dresser. She wasn't as insensitive as you think. I don't care. She left. It's not my problem now. Is that why you're at the house? To nose around... You should look to the future. At this rate, you'll end up alone and that really upsets me, you know. I came across it by chance. You can spend your life looking back. Time stretches out to infinity... What will it get you? - Are you still in therapy? - No. You're making progress. That's good. I'll start again after this. To go and cry some more about your wicked mother who preferred her patients to her daughter? You enjoy that? Wallowing in misery... Why do you attack me? It's unbearable. You're the one always looking for a fight! I can see you can't stand me. I'm not blind! It's not that, Mum, but it's tiring being unable to talk normally. I come home and I can tell everything's a problem. Being in the house annoys you! If I buy stuff to make you happy, that annoys you! Dinner annoys you, even the tablecloth! Everything! It's all wrong! I cross half the world to see you but you're still as hard and authoritarian. It's a real pain! You're incredible! I can't believe I'm hearing this from a daughter who abandoned me. You're insane! No wonder you're alone. Who'd put up with you? Okay, I'm going. I think it's for the best. We've never got along anyway. You've always held me responsible always blamed me! It wasn't easy moving so far away. It was an opportunity. I took it and I don't regret it. You didn't decide my life. It doesn't revolve around you. Your mother left because her life was killing her. Not because of you. Guilt isjust a human emotion. I don't consider you guilty. I feel guilty too but you've never given me any choice. The same again? No, thank you. Oould you pay then? I'm finishing my shift. Yes, of course. Thank you. What are you looking for? A dress for Mum. I haven't seen her for a while. I don't really know what she'd like. This one's different. It would suit her. You think so? With the Eiffel Tower... She hates big cities. She never likes my gifts anyway. So treat yourself instead. I'd like to make her happy one day. I don't want to get it wrong. It's beautiful. Do you have any looser clothes that a pregnant woman could wear? Here, try this. Thanks. Even as a girl, it was hard making her happy. She was sad to see me unhappy and gifts didn't help. Why didn't you come back? To cancelled it all out to start anew? No, forgetting was impossible. But staying wasn't possible either. Your mother never forgave me. I think I'd have left too. I tried to reason with myself. You don't need to flee. You're free. Me? It's different for me. I'm scared. I'll just take the dress. Are you ok, Audrey? I feel a bit weird. You have a really pretty shop. No one tells me what to put in my window. I work with young designers, I try to support them and there's a market for it. The prices are the problem. We can't compete with the chain stores. My grandfather thought like that too. He tried to resist ready-to-wear, he worked all the time... Hi. How are you? Great, thanks. Who's that? A sort of cousin. She lives in America. How do you mean, sort of? She's G?rard's sister's daughter. She's loaded but she's still single. She's kind of weird. She's a beautiful woman anyhow. Have a good evening. The look on your faces! There was no letter when she left? No. - Oan I keep this? - Of course. What is it? Old recipes... Is Martine ok? Yes, I think so. Your mother's so tough. She chills my blood. But I hear she's a good doctor... Yes. - Oan I keep it? - I just said you could. If only I could do something to make my children proud. I like to know, like those women whose books I read. They're intelligent and independent. My life is at home. I'm not even a good housewife. Other women seem happy. They smile in any case. G?rard has grown a lot lately. Martine too. My daughter is as reactionary as the others. She judges me and hates me. Me too, I end up hating her. She defends her father against me. My loves, I'm leaving this house. I feel so bad. My darling children, I'm going away for a while to try to find a new life where we will be happy at last. I would like some tomatoes. These aren't bad. The trouble starts when you hesitate between two pairs. Sorry. That's right. Unless... I think these are ideal for you. Try them on again. They're both serious and playful. Intelligent glasses. I'm not saying she has an excuse but you're being a pain too. Why? Is trying to find out wrong? Her mother walked out 50 years ago. What of it? Why pester her? I'm sure she knows stuff. Why are you so obsessed by Louise? Because she was a mother, yet left anyway? So you think your mother hasn't been maternal enough and so on... You're starting to piss me off with all this. Because... if her father had left, no one would have given a damn! What are you so upset about? No one gives a damn about the father! I stayed at home while your mother worked. I cooked for you, I helped you with your homework... You've forgotten all that. The father doesn't count. Even having a kid without a father wouldn't be a problem for you, I bet. What are you talking about? You're pregnant, right? Look at the state you're in. Your mother has realized. You turn up here and say nothing. We have to bring things to a head to find out a little about your life and what you're going through. Personally, I'm hurt that you haven't told us. Something smells good. It's a new recipe. You're turning into a real cordon bleu in your new kitchen. Gilles. Things are getting better. I feel good, I keep busy... But... I'd like my own bank account. What for? You spoil me but I was a bit short yesterday and I hate having to ask each time. I manage the budget well and I'd like to have my own account but I need your agreement. I'll think about it. I could give you surprises too. I'd like to be able to spoil you. What I'd really like is to see you have friends round and organize gatherings, the way other wives do. We have a beautiful home, you should be proud of it. You're right. She writes well for someone without an education. That's true. But what she says is so sad. She shouldn't have married him. But we can't help that. Isn't it odd that she left without it? And without the money? She was probably upset and forgot it. What could this money be? She probably had money for the week. Money to do the shopping... This is too much. Have you shown your mother? She doesn't want to know. I understand that. Martine suffered a lot over it. No more than you. I was younger. I guess she protected me. She was a second mother to me. In my memories, they merge together. Was Louise hard with you? No. She was tender but she was sad too. But maybe I imagined her as being sad after she left. The way she writes... I tried to find her. I went to the cops, in vain. Oertain songs make me think of her now. She dressed well. She always dressed well, I remember. I found her beautiful. It doesn't matter, dear. Hurry up now. Let's get to work. - Hello, madam. - Hello. I'd like to empty my account to buy my husband a new car. The whole amount? Yes, please. He's dreamt of it for so long. - Oan you give me a minute? - Of course. I handle such amounts myself. I understand. Thank you. You went to the bank? I wanted to buy you a new car. What an idiot I was to trust you. Leave this house now, Louise. Leave immediately. You're not happy, you want to work, so leave. Keep the money. But never try to come back, you hear. I don't want to see you again. I'll demand custody of the children. I won't let you take my children. You're incapable of looking after them. You're right. Maybe they're better with you for now. I'm really sorry. I'll get some napkins. It's all right. I'm soaked but it's all right. Do you want to borrow a sweater? Yes, please. Thank you. It's sweet of you. Don't worry, it doesn't matter. You're really kind too. I could lose my job over this. Shall I get you another? No, thank you, I have to go. I'll bring your sweater back. If I forget, I'm on Avenue de la Mer, number 15. - Are you married? - No. - You don't have a guy? - No. Your skin's so soft. You smell good. I'd like it to be functional, for a reasonable price. Good morning. I rang the bell. I thought you'd gone out. No, I was sleeping. It's late to be getting up. I'm resting. I need it. - We won't be long. - Take as long as you like. Ohanging the kitchen? I know you like it but if we may do it along with the plumbing. - You spoke to G?rard about it? - No. Evelyne decides. Their place is absolutely hideous. You're renting it out? This house causes no end of needless tension. We'll do it up and then we'll see. Don't tell my brother. I'll pay for it. - You should let him know. - Yes. I think I have everything. I'll send you an estimate. See you soon. Goodbye. - Are you well? - Yes. The work won't begin right away. When are you leaving? In two days. - You must be pleased. - Why? It's natural to be pleased to be going home. I'll go now. I have something for you. I hope you'll like it. Thank you. Shall I open it? Maybe not. Right... It's silly, I forgot it in the car. Thank you... Right, I'll let you work. Is something wrong? No, not at all. But I have a lot to do and you have your consultations. No, I'm free all day. What's wrong? I'm bleeding. - A lot? - A little. All right, that can happen. Don't panic but it's best to check. Get dressed. I'll wait for you. Everything's fine. Thanks for taking me. I feared it might be an ectopic pregnancy. You lose the foetus and you end up in hospital. It can leave you sterile too. We can be happy it's not that. I feel so tired, Mum. Don't move. What do you need? I'd like my thick sweater. It's up in my room. Dad? What time is it? Yes, she was with me. I don't know. I fell asleep. Where did you find it? Behind the kitchen dresser. It's Dad. He's looking all over for you. Yes. Everything's fine. I won't be long. Are you ok, Mum? Just leave me alone now. Yes, Mum. What's happening? Where are you? You know, Audrey, I've tried... to pass on a taste for freedom to you. It's what my mother wanted too. When G?rard and I went anywhere, people would whisper about us. I became hardened. I wanted them to know we were managing without her. But, inside, I tried to be someone she could be proud of. I also wanted you to be strong, independent... Mum, why did she leave the money? Why did she leave it? I don't know. He called her a thief, said she took his money... But she didn't take it. He said she had vanished, that he'd looked for her... But he didn't call the police and her family didn't hear from her either. He should have called the police. He said he'd looked for her all day. But why did he look for her since her suitcase was in her room? What suitcase? When G?rard and I got home from school, the door wasn't locked. There was no one home but the door was unlocked. It was Suzanne's son's birthday party but I didn't want us to go. I was ashamed my mother wasn't there. I felt so ashamed of her. I thought that she might be asleep, so I went to their room. The suitcase was there with her things. Isn't it strange she took nothing with her? Without a word and without taking anything. I was in the kitchen. My father got home late. He seemed very odd. He said she'd robbed him. He asked why I wasn't in bed. He didn't ask if she had come back. He was filthy, covered in mud... He had dirt on his hands. They were filthy. And his eyes... scared me. He looked mad. The next morning, he said she'd called... to say she wouldn't be back. And he burnt all her things. We have nothing. I didn't lie to you, we have nothing of hers. He took the secret to his grave. - Walk me home. - Of course, Mum. - Martine, what's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing's wrong. What happened? He killed her. Gilles killed Louise. That's not possible... You should go up and see Mum. Want to sleep here? No, I'd rather go back. Her blood pressure is low. Make sure she eats and stays nearby. All right. At first, he was always barking and never obeyed. You've trained him well. I haven't finished yet but I'm pleased with him. She's strong, you know. I won't take them. They ease the pain. I'm just tired. I had considered it, of course. Not seriously. In any case, he never mentioned her. We can never prove it anyway. I'd never seen my sister cry before. I have to be going. Love to Evelyne. All right. Mum, it's me. Oan I come in? Yes. Let me help. - Has G?rard gone? - Yes. He's gone to work. Evelyne will worry. If he's away more than an hour, she gets frantic. I'll lock the house up. I'm going to stay here a while. You see, she put the dress on.
