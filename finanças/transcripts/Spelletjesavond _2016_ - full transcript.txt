I was afraid you were delayed. I?m still right on time. It?s finally time. Nervous? You?re nervous enough for both of us. Are you okay? It?s friday. - So? That means game night. That?s every friday. My mother is quite traditional. Game night is her thing. I?m fanatical during board games. You know that, right? My mother too. That?s why I?m worried. It?ll be fine. It?ll be a nice evening. Yes! I can roll the dice again! Lucky me. What?s not an abbreviation of an infectious disease? TBC, First Aid or SARS? - First Aid! Yes. You always get the easy questions. - Stop whining! Which beer is not a Belgium abbey beer? Val Dieu, Grimbergen or Hoegaarden? Val Dieu? No, it?s Hoegaarden. Hoegaarden is a wheat beer. Not an abbey beer. I don?t even drink beer. What?s the name of the Roman God with two faces... ...that stands for beginnings and transitions? What? How should I know that? It?s Janus, right? Correct. - I knew it! Stop complaining. You?re just not good at history, Little Bunny. I?m going to get another drink. Anyone else? No? ?Little Bunny?? - Yes, I know. I?m sorry. Mine is worse: Rick the Dick. What?s so funny, guys? I?m telling a joke, darling. That?s the first time someone laughs at your jokes. I?ve been holding back. I think your mother needs some competition. No, no, no. Don?t. No, don?t. Seriously, don?t do it. Well, Liz. It?s your turn. Show us what you can do. I?ll put on a new record. Turn it off, Little Bunny. I don?t want to hear music anymore. Honey, I think... - I don?t want to hear it. We?ll continue the game. Liz is going to run out of luck soon. Go ahead, Liz. Roll the dice. I have to go to the toilet. Can you show me where it is? In the hallway. Go right and then on your left. Right. I?ll show you the way. Maybe I should go home. Your mother is pissed and I don?t like it anymore. She?s just a game fanatic. And she gets very hostile. But it?s nothing personal. Try not to mind. I do mind. You?re mother doesn?t like me. I can feel it! No, she?s just a sore loser. And you?re winning. And this is also how she treats me and my dad. All my life. It?ll be fine. Alright then. No, you always pick the difficult questions. Let Liz pick a card and read the question. Which is the most broken bone in the human body? Leg, wrist or collarbone? The wrist. I?m sure. It?s the collarbone. I?m afraid Liz brings bad luck, Pepijn. I?ve never had such bad luck before. Okay. I think I?d better leave right now. You don?t have to, Liz. Ingrid is just a sore loser. She gets cranky and starts drinking wine. Maybe she needs to leave, Rick. Okay. I?ll leave then. - But not right now. The game isn?t over. For me it is. Good evening. You stay seated and we?ll continue the game. Pepijn, can we please... - You will continue playing. Why would I do that? Because you want to win. I can see it in your eyes. That?s why I don?t understand why you want to leave. Because of me? Come on, girl. You?re better than that. Or not? Mom, I think... - Stop thinking, Little Bunny. The game continues until there?s a winner. After that, Liz can go where she wants. But mom... Take the dice, Liz. Apparently, you want to go home, so you?d better play quickly then. Nice going, darling. I?ll read the question. 13 is an unlucky number in western culture. But what?s the unlucky number in Chinese, Korean and Japanese culture? No idea. 4? And she?s right. Are you proud of yourself, young lady? You?re ruining my evening. Okay. I?m sorry, but I?m done here. I?m sorry for being smarter than you. Pepijn, I?m leaving. - No, Liz. You?re staying here. No. We?re not going home. Not yet... - Not yet... Pepijn, what?s going on here? It?s game night, Liz. And it?s still your turn. You answered correctly. No, I don?t want to play. It?s only a game. Come on. Roll the dice. The last wedge you need, lies within your reach. Let?s see... The question is... What do you think of me? What? You?ve heard me, smarty-pants. It doesn?t say that. If I say it says that, then it?s true. The question is simple: What do you think of me? I think you?re a horrible person, who can?t handle losing. The only correct answer. She?s fantastic, Pepijn. You?ve found a beautiful girlfriend. Boy oh boy. Jezus, mom. You were creepy. Holy shit. Sorry. Pepijn wanted to do something funny. Meeting the in-laws is always so boring and stiff. ?What do you study?? ?How did you guys meet?? Terrible, all those questions. - He told us you were a board game fanatic. Hence the special welcoming comittee. We?re not normally like this, but I think that?s pretty obvious. You were great, honey! Come here! Oh, honey! Look, I?ve got goosebumps. - Poor Ricky! And ?Little Bunny?? It just popped up in my mind. I?m going to use it more often. Yes. Nothing wrong with that, right? Well, these are my parents. My mother Ingrid. Nice to meet you. - And my father Roderick. Hello. Shall we have a drink on the couch? Get a bit more acquainted? I think I?ve had enough of getting acquainted! You guys are completely insane! I don?t want to see you again, asshole! Well... The next time you want to break up with a girlfriend, please text her. Yes... But this is way more fun. Charming. You?re just like your mother. I?ve had a great time. The bitch shouldn?t have cheated on you. Shall we play a new game? You don?t have to ask that. Let?s play. I?ll take this one away. - I want to be orange. You?re orange? - Yes. I?m purple. - You?re purple. And I want to start! - You can start.
