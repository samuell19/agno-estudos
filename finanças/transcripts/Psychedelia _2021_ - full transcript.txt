- I felt this connection with everything. Especially with nature. - I have understood for a long time that change is a part of the essential nature of the universe, and that I've always been afraid of change. But today I felt deeply that change is a gift. - I wish I could put it into words. It was a sense of a connectedness that runs through all of us and also a sense of the strength of it and the power of it. - Mystical experience has been a part of human nature as far as we know and most major religions and traditions at the core, were about a mystical experience. Mysticism is unlike a belief in something, or knowledge based on what someone tells you. It's the direct experience of that thing. What's been called the ground of being to quote Paul Tillich or "all that is", Om Tat Sat in Hinduism, or in Christianity, Christ Consciousness. It's a direct experience with all that is, with nature, with God as some would call it. - The word 'psychedelic' means mind manifesting and it came from a poem: "To fathom Hell or soar angelic, just take a pinch of psychedelic." - The word 'psychedelic' was coined by a psychiatric researcher named Humphry Osmond. In a letter to author Aldous Huxley in 1956, before Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey, or the hippie movement. And yet, the use of psychedelics goes back long before the 20th century. For as long as humans have been roaming the earth, they've ingested and worshipped these mysterious plants. - In the 16th and 17th centuries, when the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the new world, they were horrified by what they observed. They saw the native people using a vast pharmacopeia of native plants for purposes of healing and divination and this was entirely in conflict with the orthodox rigid belief system the conquistadors brought with them. - The mushroom ceremonies happened at night. They involved invoking spirits, defining the future, looking for lost things and, you know, there were women who were doing the ceremonies as well as men. So, so many things probably about that culture were shocking and certainly in Christianity, the power is given to priests who speak on behalf of God. So, the thing that is scary about psychedelics is that it gives power directly to people. - The Inquisition in the year 1616 formally condemned the use of hallucinogenic plants and stated that the punishment for anyone who would use such plants, whether they be Natives or immigrant Spaniards was death by the cruelest methods available. - 1938... - In 1938, as Europe stood on the brink of World War, a chemist working for a pharmaceutical company in Switzerland made a most unusual discovery. One that would alter the course of human events to come. - Albert Hofmann was, from a young person, very focused on nature, kind of a nature mystic almost, and he worked at Sandoz Pharmaceutical Company and they were looking in 1938, is when he invented LSD. It was also from ergot which is a fungus that grows on wheat and barley. He was looking at various compounds where he could start with what was in ergot and manipulate them in different ways. And LSD-25 was the 25th variation. In 1943, five years later, he had what he called a peculiar presentiment, that there was something worthwhile in LSD-25. - He accidentally ingested some because you don't need that much LSD to get into your system. And he had a really unexpected experience. It wasn't, you know, anything that blew his mind, but it was enough that he paid attention. - It was on a Friday, and so he went home over the weekend and on Monday, April 19th 1943, he decided that he would do a planned experiment. He would take an amount that he said was so small that he thought nothing would happen, but he wanted to be extra cautious and that turned out to be 250 micrograms, 250 millionths of a gram. - Which, 100 micrograms is usually enough for someone who's naive to LSD to have, you know, a full-blown experience. - Hofmann feared that his nightmare would never end. That he had permanently damaged his mind and wondered what his wife and children would think when they returned home to find a madman in the living room. Slowly, the effects wore off and after a night's rest he entered his garden where everything was teaming with life. - Woke up the next day and felt refreshed, rejuvenated, he found things to be novel and interesting. He went back to the lab to figure out what had happened. Nobody thought that anything, in terms of the microgram range, could create an effect. But in fact, he discovered this very potent compound. Then, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals tested it in animals for safety and toxicity and tested in some of the members of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals. - In 1943, when Hofmann became temporarily psychotic through accidental ingestion of the drug, The door swung wide open for research into the nature of the schizophrenic process and, in a larger sense, into the biochemistry of psychosis. - They believed that it might be a tool to help psychiatrists understand the inner experience of their psychotic or schizophrenic patients. So they packaged samples of LSD and shipped them out to the leading psychiatric researchers around the world. - I'm going to give you this cup that contains lysergic acid 100 microgram. - Suggesting that they try this compound themselves, that it was a psychotomimetic drug. That it would induce the kind of psychotic experience that their patients were going through. It would better help them understand and so, better help them treat. - How do you feel? - Well, I feel very fine. I feel very buoyant and light and resilient. I feel as though, this chair is not solid as it seems to be. I have feeling that my hands are not resting against this chair and I see flashes of color, quite a bit. I see this rug, for example, seems to have an awful lot of compliments of violet and yellow. It seems to feel that I'm going to watch it. - Now as it turned out, the experience is not at all like what the inner experience of a schizophrenic is. - Now when you look at your hands, do as I do, close your eyes and just concentrate on your hands. - There it is. I feel these lovely colors vibrating all over me, oh it's lovely! - Any lines? - Oh! - Any forms? - Just like the shimmering of water, you know. - You can put your hand down now. Come on, describe it. - Oh I don't know. - Hmm? - It's just giving and... oh you just don't know. You, you want, you want to give yourself, you want to give yourself as much as you can. - There's all sorts of things happening during a psychedelic experience. One thing is that the 5-HT2A receptor, which is like the psychedelic receptor, is being stimulated quite a bit, and that's mostly serotonin. But then, it turns out that if you stimulate the 5-HT2A receptor enough, it actually creates a receptor couple with a whole other transmitter system, which is oxytocin. They form what's called a dimer, they dimerize and they create a receptor complex. In a couple, when you fall in love with someone, there's a lot of oxytocin and you're open to them and you're bonding with them. With a mother nursing a baby and there's maternal-infant bonding, oxytocin is there for that. - I feel very benevolent. I mean I feel as though I have no enemies in the world and this is very lovely. - That sense of oneness and unity and connection signifies sort of the peak of a psychedelic experience and when you come away from that, you come away changed. - The insight that I was getting from traditional and classic Buddhist meditation was similar to the insight that I finally arrived at under the acid. The lesson was, form is emptiness, there's a sense of emptiness and transitoriness in all perceived phenomena and that there's no need to be hysterically hung up on any thought form, no need to grab and there is no enlightenment, no wisdom, no illumination, no god, no identity, no self, no reference point, and that any grabbing for a reference point is vain and that's one of the first things you think when you get high anyway. That even if you didn't get high you'd be seeing the same reality. That in a sense, acid is not necessary and that's why it's ok. - In the early 1950s, as LSD research was in its infancy, little was known in the West about naturally occurring psychedelics. In 1953, author Aldous Huxley was given mescaline, the active ingredient in the Peyote cactus, under the supervision of psychiatrist Humphry Osmond. Huxley later wrote about this experience in the seminal book 'The Doors of Perception.' And in New York City, a very unlikely character helped bridge the gap between the ancient traditions and modern America. - R. Gordon Wasson was a very successful businessman and banker. He was a Vice President of J.P. Morgan. As a young man, he met his future wife, Valentina, who was Russian, and she had a great interest and enthusiasm for the collection of edible mushrooms. - While on their honeymoon in the Catskill Mountains, Valentina leaped with excitement after spying a cluster of wild mushrooms growing in the forest. She sounded off the species name in Russian and insisted that they prepare them for dinner that night. Wasson, of Anglo-Saxon heritage, was brought up to believe mushrooms were poison and was horrified at his wife's enthusiasm. This difference in cultural attitudes became the catalyst for Wasson's lifelong interest in mycology, or the study of fungi. - And then in the early 50s, a friend of his wrote him a letter suggesting he look into an extant mushroom cult in the central highlands of Mexico, where he had heard that there was use of hallucinogenic mushrooms. Now this came as quite a surprise to Wasson because at this time, the early 50s, it was not believed that there were such things as hallucinogenic mushrooms. - We went into the Mazatec area. Far from the highways. Remote from Mexico City, there we found that rotten bagasse as it's called, bagazo, covered with mushrooms! These mushrooms, I didn't know, had never seen, they were the sacred mushrooms. - After much difficulty and by some accounts, manipulation on the part of Wasson, he eventually found entry into a Velada, or a mushroom ceremony. The curandera, or healer, was a woman named Maria Sabina who represented a long line of underground healers left intact since the days of Spanish conquest. - We were seeing incredible sights. All your senses are rendered acute and we say that you see visions, you see hallucinations, but that doesn't begin to tell the story, the hallucinations are only part of it. You hear sounds. You smell things. The night was thrilling. - The visions were not blurred or uncertain. I felt that I was now seeing plain, whereas ordinary vision gives us an imperfect view. I was seeing the archetypes. The platonic ideas that underlie the imperfect images of everyday life. The thought crossed my mind. Could the divine mushrooms be the secret that lay behind the ancient mysteries? Could the miraculous mobility that I was now enjoying be the explanation for the flying witches that played so important a part of the folklore and the fairytales of northern Europe? These reflections passed through my mind at the very same time that I was seeing the visions. For the effect of the mushrooms is to bring about a fission of the spirit, a split in the person, a kind of schizophrenia. - Unbeknownst to Wasson, his trips to Mexico were infiltrated by a group with more nefarious interests in the mind altering effects of psychedelics. - In their never ending search for the miracle weapon, CIA operatives searched here in the remote mountain areas of southern Mexico for what, up to then, had been considered a myth: magic mushrooms. - So, Gordon Wasson was unwittingly participating in this sort of military use of psychedelics. - They used this man, a part-time chemist with the CIA, to dupe this man, a vice president of a bank and an amateur mycologist or mushroom expert, to try to get to the magic mushrooms and turn them into a drug. - They gave it to several different chemists to try to figure out what was in it and nobody could figure it out. So, they called on Albert Hofmann since he had invented LSD and they asked him, could he figure out what was in the mushroom that made it so psychedelic. - It would be the amateur, R. Gordon Wasson and his colleagues, who would win the race and develop the drug psilocybin from the magic mushrooms. - Wasson was friends with Henry Booth Luce who was the publisher of Life magazine. He told his friend Luce about his experience and Luce encouraged him to write up his account. That was really the first word out to western civilization that psychedelic mushrooms indeed existed at all. It really stimulated growing interest and led to the psychedelic explosion of the 60s. - Wasson's influence became due in large part to an enigmatic Harvard psychologist named Timothy Leary. Though he became known as the most dangerous man in America, he might have been described by others in the year 1960 as a New England square, a hard drinking Irishman, or by himself an atheist psychologist in the midst of a mid-life crisis. - Timothy Leary was a very prominent researcher at Harvard. His California Personality Inventory is still being used today. He was sort of a Pied Piper. - During his early years at Harvard, Leary was in the throes of personal crisis. His first wife had committed suicide on his 35th birthday, reportedly after a strained open marriage. It was during this time that he described himself as an anonymous institutional employee, who drove to work each morning in a long line of commuter cars and drove home each night and drank martinis, like several million middle class, liberal, intellectual robots. Inspired by Wasson's article, Leary traveled down to Mexico with a colleague in 1960, who had found some mushrooms from a curandero in the mountains. Leary later said that he learned more about the brain and its possibilities and more about psychology in the five hours after taking the mushrooms, than he had in the preceding 15 years of studying and doing research in psychology. - When he got back to Harvard, he got permission to do research with psilocybin. - And that was the beginning of the Harvard Psilocybin Research Project, and that was really the beginning of formal research in attempt to clinical research of psychedelic agents in the United States. - Timothy Leary had two research projects that grew out of the Harvard psilocybin research program. The Good Friday study with Walter Pahnke was a remarkable study and groundbreaking. They had given psilocybin and a placebo to 20 graduate students of Theology. Comparing their experiences to genuine mystical experiences found throughout millennia, through mystics and saints. - They arranged to have access to the Marsh Chapel. It was Good Friday. They were in a basement chapel and the service from upstairs in the main chapel was being piped through. - Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister who was Martin Luther King's mentor. This incredible dynamic speaker, orator. - You, Pilot, standing for Rome, are the universal coward. I, standing for the Kingdom of God have braved everything, lost everything, and won an eternal crown. - They developed a scale of mystical experience. Some of the items are a noetic quality and intuitive quality of understanding things. Transcendence of time and space as we know it. A sense of unity with all living things and internally as well. - I shall die. But that is all that I shall do for death. - Of the 20 experimental students, nine out of the 20 people had a mystical experience and eight out of those nine had the psilocybin. - It was the first study showing that these agents, these medicines, these sacraments, can produce an experience that was found throughout millennia and in various religious traditions. - One young man had a kind of nervous... I was gonna say nervous breakdown, but it was actually positive for him, so he was so blown away by this spiritual experience he was having, that he kind of ran out of the chapel and he was trying to run, I think, to the dean or the president's office to proclaim everything that he had learned. - And behaved rather bizarrely out in public until the sitters found him and retrieved him and brought him back. - And he actually had to be sedated with a tranquilizer. So, that's kind of an interesting piece of history that didn't get reported. - The object of this presentation is to demonstrate the effect of MER-17, a new blocking agent against the development of LSD-25 psychosis. We have used two healthy graduate students in psychology as subjects. - When Sandoz discovered the psychoactive effects of LSD, they also observed that it deepens, sort of, introspective insight and can be used in psychotherapy. - So, it's really a unique history and the area of drug research in that there was a heyday of psychedelic research, extending from the 1950s through the early 70s. - Back then, any psychiatric researcher or clinician could write Sandoz to get a sample of LSD to test it or to use it clinically. It was legal and available and that really began the big experiment with LSD that lasted close to 30 years. - In carefully controlled experiments, interesting results have been reported on the therapeutic use of LSD with the mentally ill, the drug addict, the terminal cancer patient. And in the VA Hospital in Topeka, Kansas, a special research program for alcoholics. - We bring them in on one Monday and they spend one week of getting acquainted and having all the tests and examinations done. The second Monday we give them a small dose of LSD in the five-man ward, together. Then the third Monday we give them a larger dose individually and have each one of them cared for by one of these teams. And this is where we aim for the so-called psychedelic experience. - The best clinical outcomes are with subjects who, during the course of what was often just a one session treatment, during that session had a psychospiritual epiphany, a mystical level experience. - I know I kept fighting the religious music. I didn't know why then, but Dr. Curran kept urging me to find out why I was fighting this and I remember I was just literally scared to death. And I just reached up and it was like, somebody grabbed me and brought me up. And I interpret this as for the first time in my life I wanted love, and I think this is the thing that was probably my biggest problem, was that I thought everybody was forcing it on me and I wasn't gonna let 'em. - The amazing thing about LSD is very much its evolutionary nature. It seems to concentrate in areas of the brain that relate to mammalian and reptilian stages of evolutionary development which are then experienced by the person. The fact, also, that people become aware of the fact that man is not just a single dimensional being in a physical body, but exists as a being over many, many lifetimes at many levels of consciousness beyond the physical. I do feel that in the future, there will be centers where people will be able to go, to prepare people for any kind of turning point or crisis in their life, such as along the lines of the incredible, powerful research that Stan Grof and Walter Pahnke did at Spring Grove Hospital with terminal cancer patients. - This is a mental institution, Spring Grove State Hospital in Baltimore. It is one of four places in the country where research on LSD treatment continues under federal sponsorship. The tablets in hand each contain a microscopic trace of LSD. To an observer, the atmosphere seems closer to faith healing than medicine. - So the way in which they really refined the approach is that they used a two person team, often a male female. They pioneered eight hour therapy sessions, sometimes even longer. It was this very expressive, supportive environment. - It isn't so much the drug as the drug in the context in which it's used, the expectations, how the person is held safely or while they're under the influence of it, and the interpretation that's made afterwards. - I was here under LSD. This went on for a million miles on both sides an endless deep and eternity onto and it was just one of the fears I had buried and it was a fear of being left alone. - We get very stuck in our ways and sort of rigid in our thinking, you know. One of the things that psychedelics do is they increase cognitive flexibility, right? You become less rigid in how you think. They quiet down the default mode network which is sort of the self-obsessed, self-serving, how am I doing? Who am I? Am I liked? What did I do yesterday? What am I going to do tomorrow? And the psychedelics sort of quiet this narcissism and neuroticism and allow other parts of the brain to get more active or to connect with each other. - I feel beautiful! Alright! - I feel squashed with beautiful! - That's a really powerful, useful experience to have. And it can help people sort of out of a dark place. - If you hadn't been prepared for it, if you hadn't gone through those weeks of preparation, would LSD have meant as much? - If I was ill before, I would have been ill, it seems to me, beyond repair. I would have been so frightened without the guidance and the trust and the preparation. It would have been a tragedy, horrible. - I got interested in LSD therapy when I was a two-year public health service at the Public Health Prison Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky. At that time, there was really no good treatment for narcotic addiction. Recidivism rate was extraordinarily high. I think people leaving Lexington had a 90% relapse rate. I had read about the studies with alcoholism and I thought perhaps LSD might be useful to provide some lasting change for narcotic addiction. In looking at the literature, at that time, it looked like therapists who had used LSD themselves got much better results than therapists who had not used LSD themselves. So I decided to do a controlled study. I would give LSD to a group of narcotics addicts at Lexington, who volunteered for the study, without taking LSD myself, to see what impact that the experience might have on their relation with other prisoners, with authority figures, with, insight about themselves. Then, my plan was to then take the LSD myself under supervision from staff at the Addiction Research Center there, who were experienced with the agent, and do a second group. But, unfortunately when I was getting ready to do that the company that made LSD, Sandoz, decided to recall it. This was around 1965, 1966, because LSD had become a street drug. - On streets like this, transactions involving me take place all the time. Illegal, of course. But my tabs and caps and sugar cubes that dissolve in your mind, as well as your mouth, are selling every day. Drop a cap of me, man... then drop out. But watch it, because the trip can be a trap, too. You never know where a ticket with me will take you. - Just as pioneers of psychedelic research were beginning to understand its therapeutic potential, LSD began to leak out of the laboratory. The two figures most responsible for its expansion into the American culture lived on opposite ends of the country and were from equally different backgrounds. On the West coast, Ken Kesey was introduced to LSD in the late 1950s as part of the CIAs MK-ULTRA Program. - I, at the time, was training for the Olympics. I made it to be an alternate- - As a wrestler? - Yeah, as a wrestler. I'd never been drunk on beer, let alone do any drugs, but this is the American government. I had a neighbor who was a psychologist. He was booked to do the experiments that Tuesday. He chickened out. He says, "You want to do them? $20, show up." They gave them to me. I did them then on every Tuesday for six or eight months. The government wanted somebody to look in that room. They said, "Hey we got a great room, we discovered this nice room! Let's get somebody to go there and look it over." - Kesey would go on to write 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' partly based on these experiences. And later, to host the so-called acid tests with the Merry Pranksters. - By that time, the government had said, ok, stop that experiment. All these guinea pigs that we've sent up there into outer space, bring them back down and don't ever let them go back in there again because we don't like the look in their eyes. - I give the CIA total credit for sponsoring and initiating the entire consciousness movement counterculture events of the 1960s. - And on the East coast was Timothy Leary, the now former Harvard psychologist. - He began to distribute the drug beyond his research subjects. He began to speak quite openly to the press. - He signed an agreement promising that he would not give it to any undergraduate students, but only to graduate students who were using it for some appropriate academic purpose. - And Tim Leary, honestly, I don't think he ever met a rule he didn't like and that rule quickly was broken. The Harvard administration found out and summarily dismissed him. - And he became the... the apostle preaching the religion of psychedelic drugs. - We teach the science and art of ecstasy. We teach people how to turn on or how to go out of their minds. By turn on, we mean tune in to get beyond your routine ways of thinking and acting and experiencing. We often say that we're teaching people how to use their head. The point is that in order to use your head, you have to go out of your mind. - What were your feelings when people like Timothy Leary and Ken Kesey, Ken Kesey with his Pranksters, and then Timothy Leary obviously with, "tune in, turn on, drop out," what were your feelings as the chemist who had created this? - You know, drugs are subversive and psychedelics are the most subversive of all the drugs and he was labeled most dangerous man in America because of these very powerful and very subversive drugs and ideas. - Many of my colleagues have maintained a rather harsh view of Leary. They blame him for the repression of psychedelic research in the 60s. We shouldn't lose sight of the fact of the degree to which psychedelics in the culture were associated with a very vigorous anti-war movement. - The kind of "turn on, tune in, drop out" that phrase gets a bad rap, but if you look at what was happening at the time, I think the call was for young people to not buy into the status quo. - Some people talk about the countercultures being this like romantic, even religious movement. That you're talking about using these means to free yourself up from the distractions of the world so that you can transcend it and think about ultimate questions about human existence and that's really what, you know, Leary was talking about. - What we're thinking about is a peaceful planet. We're not thinking about any kind of power. We're not thinking about revolution or war or any of that. We would all like to be able to live an uncluttered life, a simple life, a good life, you know, and like think about moving the whole human race ahead a step. - They're taking it in sugar cubes, it's being dropped into their punch, they're going to institutions, they're screwed for the rest of their life! - AHH! God, no! No! No! No! - Authorities felt they had a public health crisis on their hands and these were also catalysts for change, and the changes they were inducing were often perceived in a very threatening manner by those in authority. - This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the Communist masters of deceit. - We've gotta do something about this, don't you think so? - The drug war is based on demonizing drugs and demonizing drug users. Nixon said that the two main enemies that he had were the Civil Rights Movement and the hippies. And so, while you couldn't criminalize the ideas that they were struggling for, you could criminalize the drugs that they were using. - We must wage what I have called total war against public enemy number one in the United States, the problem with dangerous drugs. - Richard Nixon declared War on Drugs and Congress in 1970 passed the Controlled Substance Act, which essentially put all serotonergic hallucinogens like LSD and psilocybin into this very restrictive category, schedule I. Which means highest addictive liability, no therapeutic utility. And that was really the beginning of the War on Drugs, that we now have for the last 40 years, which has created a real problem. - At the time, something like 123 million prescriptions were written by psychiatrists and doctors for tranquilizers. More people are killed in car crashes cause they're drunk than die because of LSD. What kind of drugs are ok and what aren't is a very political question. - Abuse of hard drugs began to replace mind expanding agents and LSD faded from the culture almost as quickly as it had exploded into it. By the 1970s, all remaining psychedelic studies had been shut down. - In 1972, '73, I had left school and I got a job as a research assistant in a dream research study at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. My job was to stay up all night and monitor sleep EEGs and every time our subject went into a dream, I would wake them up over an intercom system, ask them what was going through their mind, and tape record the dreams. But this also meant I had a lot of time during the night and I love to read and one of the researchers in his office, he had a tremendous collection of books and articles on psychedelics, and I read voraciously. Now at that time, my father was very concerned about what he thought was my lack of direction and he had told me that when I figured out what I wanted to do with my life, I should call him. It didn't matter what time of the day or night it was, he wanted me to call him. So, there I was at two or three o'clock in the morning just so impressed by what they had done and I felt, I want to do this also. So, I woke him up from deep sleep and I said, "Dad! I figured out what I want to do!" And he said, "Well, what's that son?" I said, "I want to study psychedelics!" "Well, why is that?" "Well, they're fascinating! There's so much that we could learn about the brain, about the mind-brain interface, about mental illness, and there are these extraordinary treatment models and people for who conventional treatments cannot help, are helped with this model!" And he said, "Well son, there might be something to what you say, but no one will listen to you unless you get your credentials." - My personal background really has a lot to do with Timothy Leary and the use of psychedelics in society. I had been born Jewish in 1953. I was raised on stories of the Holocaust and then as a young boy I was involved in going to school during the Cuban Missile Crisis. This idea that there could be nuclear war and we would wipe out civilization, was also very traumatizing. The final step for me was Vietnam, and I was in the last years of the lottery and I was a Vietnam War protester, a draft resister. And so I first tried LSD in '71, but I had a very difficult time and I couldn't really handle my psychedelic experiences. I went to the guidance counselor at my college and I was so lucky, the guidance counselor took me seriously and he said that this was an important exploration that I was doing and he gave me a book to read which was a manuscript copy of 'Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research' by Stan Grof. When I read this book, everything fell into place for me. I saw this therapeutic use and also the spiritual aspects of it and I felt, ok this is a response to the craziness of the world. - It seems to me that since the French Revolution and the enlightenment, man was put at the center of the universe and certain difficult notions of God on which one was dependent were put aside, and that notion of man being at the center of the universe led to the industrial society that we have around us led to a great deal of energy. The LSD experience and what we've been through in the 60s has brought us to a whole new philosophy that man is not the center of the universe, that we're simply the transformer of energies and that we live in a sort of cosmic ecology for which we're responsible. This is, to my mind, the great challenge that's in front of us. To take the consciousness and the individual headspace that we've all managed to develop and now begin asking ourselves what it is all for and how can we use it? - We're now in sort of what you can consider a second renaissance of psychedelic research. There are a handful of centers in the U.S. universities, that are conducting research studies. Probably the reinitiation of psychedelic research, I would really credit Rick Strassman. - Rick Strassman had been one of the doctors that I had worked with and he decided that he would submit a protocol for DMT and sort of looking at it as a potential cause of schizophrenia. - Psychotomimetic model, so it means mimicking psychosis. So, it's a way for a government agency to feel ok about funding psychedelic research. - So, the Pilot Drug Evaluation Staff approved this study in 1990. - And really kind of reinitiated the field, I would say, and then our work here, Roland Griffiths got it started not long after. - In 2006, the Hopkins team set the standard for scientific rigor by publishing their landmark study, a follow-up to Walter Pahnke's and Timothy Leary's Good Friday Experiment. Concluding that under the right setting, psilocybin can reliably induce a mystical experience. - I knew nothing about Johns Hopkins. I didn't know anything about Baltimore. I didn't know Roland Griffiths. I didn't know any of these characters. I ended up going to grad school out in California where we were doing a study with meditators when Roland's paper was published on mystical experiences promoted by psilocybin. I just remember saying to my advisor, I was like, "that's where I'm going next." - Katherine MacLean's research on openness, that was a really big deal, that study, because it was always thought that your personality is your personality. And how novelty seeking you are and open you are, that's just who you are, those things don't really change. But, what the Hopkins trials showed was that people do become more open and you can actually measure it on a personality test and that's a big deal. - 70% of people were saying this is among the five most personally meaningful experiences of my life. I would ask people, what does that mean? And someone might say, well, you know, when my first child was born, my daughter, that changed my life forever. Recently, my father passed away, that was big, it's kind of like that. - It was around 2006 and I had just taken over as the head of the Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse at Bellevue. As an addiction psychiatrist, I had always been interested in these compounds because they just seemed different from other drugs of abuse. They didn't behave like cocaine or amphetamine or tobacco. They seem completely different yet they were labeled as the most addictive drug. So, I always thought there was something interesting and different about them. At the time, one of my supervisors was Dr. Jeffrey Guss. - I saw that Albert Hofmann's 100th birthday was being celebrated in Basel, Switzerland. - When you think about what people thought about in the 60s, that LSD was going to make you drop out of society, Albert Hofmann, who discovered LSD was married for 79 years, had a career at the same company for almost his entire life, and was an inspiration to quite a few of us. - Sort of on a lark, I went to this conference because I wanted to meet and see the people the were doing psychedelic research, and it was there that I first met Charles Grob. - Administering a psychedelic to a cancer patient with anxiety had not occurred since the early 1970s and I felt this was an ideal patient population to really start off with because the early literature was so impressive. And all of this, from FDA through the hospital committees, took several years. But I was patient and I was persistent and I felt this was really a worthy effort to make and in the end we got the approvals we had requested. - When I was at NYU, I was working at Bellevue for nine years running the psychiatric emergency room. I met with the chairman at the time, a guy named Robert Cancro, and I talked to him a lot about what was going on at UCLA or at Hopkins and saying that there was really enough people at NYU who were interested that we should try to do something at NYU. - In the 1970s, I came across the literature on psychedelics and entheogens, and I also have a long interest in palliative care, I'm a palliative care psychologist, and how we die in this county and the death anxiety and it felt the perfect match. - At first we were just an education group but after meeting Charlie Grob at UCLA, I asked him, "So this is really possible to do this and you can make a career out of this?" And he said, "Yes, and it's all about doing it correctly and carefully and avoiding mistakes made in the past." So, we decided to do it. - My name is Estalyn Walcoff and I work as a psychotherapist. - My name is Dinah Bazer. I teach figure skating. - My name is Nick Fernandez and I work as a Clinical Research Coordinator in a psychiatry department at a hospital here in New York. - I'm a adult literacy teacher, part-time, at the public library. - Well, I was diagnosed five years ago with a type of lymphoma that was untreatable. Not only was it untreatable, but everybody who had had it, had died from it. It was aggressive. - I was diagnosed with leukemia when I was 17 in 2004, and it was during my senior year of high school when I was just getting ready to go to college. - I received the official diagnosis in December of last year, so just about a year ago. - And it changed the course of my life because I went from being a physically active 17-year-old to a cancer patient. - When the chemo was over, I thought, oh let's celebrate, I thought I would want to celebrate and when the chemo was over, I didn't want to celebrate because that's when the fear set in. That's when you start thinking, when will the other shoe drop? When will this come back? - Always in my life I've been an anxious person. And naturally when I was given that diagnosis, my anxiety shot up, and even though years and years and years keep going by and I'm still ok, I know very well that this could return at any moment. I really went to work on myself because I thought that if I were going to die much sooner than I had planned, then I wanted to understand myself better. I wanted to understand spirituality better. I wanted not to have a bitter heart and I wanted to be open. So, I did what I could, for the past five years. - And I came across a post about this study. - I read it once and then I closed it and then I read it again and I said, "I qualify for that!" So, I traveled down to New York City for an initial screening interview. I traveled down to New York City several times for psychotherapy sessions with my two psychiatrists. - After several sessions of therapy and careful preparation, participants are given psilocybin in a comfortable living room setting under the guidance of their therapist team. After a brief ritual, they're encouraged to lie down on the couch, wear eye shades, and listen to classical music in order to create an inward experience. - You know, having mentioned that I had taken psychedelics in my 20s, the whole object was to see how beautiful nature was, to hear how wonderful music was. To see what could be seen. To touch what could be touched. So, this was very, very different because the whole thing that I was going to be experiencing was my own mind. - There was an immersion into complete chaos, 360 degree chaos where I had no idea of up, down, left, right. - Initially, it was absolutely terrifying. I think I can compare it to being in the hold of a ship that's in a storm tossed sea. - I also began experiencing great emotional pain. And in particular because I had been listening to black spiritual, I felt I could hear the pain in that woman's voice who was singing the song. It brought to me the whole gestalt of slavery and what that is to pull people out of their homes and treat them like animals, and I sobbed and sobbed and sobbed because of that. And the ability to just be held by my mentors and do that greatly, greatly relieved me. - I believe it was Tony who took my hand and said, "It's alright, it's alright. Just go with it." - And the further I went into it, the more it became evident to me that the chaos could not maintain its magnetic draw on me, nor its strength when I stayed focused. - The worst pain and the worst fear and the worst anxiety turned into something that has opened, which is the most precious thing I've ever known. It was a sense of connectedness that runs through all of us that I never knew, and also a sense of the strength of it and the power of it. - It looked like very dense and beautiful clouds that were almost like in a jigsaw puzzle fashion that were backlit by a moon that I could not see, so there were crevices of faint light through it and these eyes were searching me out. I felt it was a manifestation of an alienation I long carried through my whole life that was just trying to lay claim to me. I felt very profoundly that there was no one that they could find. - I saw my fear. I pictured it, I don't think this was a hallucination. I pictured it as a dark mass there. I screamed, "Get the fuck out! I will not be eaten alive by this fear!" And once that happened, it was just gone! The fear was gone. And um, it didn't come back. And it still hasn't. - I had this feeling coming over me and the thought was of compassion for myself. You know, that touches me the most. That's such a gift. - I needed to stop talking and look inside, and find that I was part of it. I was part of everything. I was part of God, you are too! Everything is. You can call it whatever you want to, I don't usually call it God, I just call it 'the one.' And that's the best thing that could ever happen to you, ever. - We coevolved on the planet with cannabis and with poppy and psilocybin mushrooms, like you know these things have been on the planet since we have, as far as I can tell, which means we've coevolved with them. And psychiatry is kind of failing, you know, many, many people are taking sleeping pills and anti-anxiety meds and antidepressants, and for a really long time. I really think there's a better way to treat addiction, or to treat the sort of despair and anxiety and malaise that many of us are feeling more and more. We need a different perspective and we need that sort of overview effect that the astronauts get, when they see that every one of us is just on this blue ball, hurdling through space. I think that psychedelics give you that perspective and so I hope they can engender more cooperation, more 'us' versus them. More of this idea that separation is an illusion, and that we all sort of have the answers for our own growth and for the healing of the planet. - If people could know how connected they really are, connected to spirit and connected to each other, connected to nature, so much of their fear would dissipate. So much of their anxiety would dissipate. I just know that if in the future this could be used with all patients under the direction of mentors, shamans, psychotherapists, it would make for a much happier world.
