S.I.F.A. Presents a film by - "Alone on the beach" Naked in the sand SEXUAL FURY (NAKED IN THE SAND) Between the azure sky and the sea The tropics in her veins Naked in the sand Giving her charms To the sun The sea desires her tenderly And the sun illuminates her beauty And the sands Over her body Want to see her In her nakedness ORIGINAL SCRIPT, FRAMING AND DIRECTION BLOOD ROUTES: 7 DEAD IN 3 CRASHES; 3 HURT Follow me, please. - Yes. Come in, Señora. There was nothing I could do. He died. And the boy? - He can still survive. Let’s have faith in God. Alicia! What a wonderful surprise! How are you, Alicia? I am so sorry for what happened. Honestly, I don’t know what to say… I had so much esteem for Adolfo. I came to see you because I’m desperate. There is no solution. The boy has a long and expensive treatment ahead. And I… I would like to work. - Work? What kind? I believe you don’t know much about office work. I never worked. You know that father gave me all I needed… and what I inherited, I gave to Adolfo. And it disappeared, little by little. Well, don’t despair. I’ll give you a check which should solve your immediate problems. In the meantime, I’ll try to find something. There are always friends for a case like this. Now I realize that you've been a truthful friend to Adolfo. Here you are. Yes, thanks! Come whenever you like. But call me first. You know, I'm very sorry for what's happening to you. You are a widow now and I liked Adolfo very much. You shouldn’t mistrust me, but call me first. - Yes, yes. Whenever you want! - Goodbye, Cacho. Thank you so much. Adolfo, forgive me! How did it go with Cacho? Honestly, I don’t know what to do. I won’t live off of him all my life, mommy. He will find you a job and slowly, things will turn around. By the way: The doctor came; Adolfito’s treatment is very expensive and the injections cost an atrocity. I knew I couldn’t see Cacho any more. I couldn’t become the lover of my husband’s best friend. I should look for a job at some other place. Good morning. - Good morning. Can I have “La Prensa”? - Here. As I explained, my dear colleague, our job is full of sacrifices and complexities. It's a good thing that once in a while there are nice surprises. For example - I am, at this very moment, dictating a letter to a new secretary who is a beauty. She has black eyes that kill, a figure… well, I cannot tell you much about it because... I haven’t... I haven’t seen it yet, but I hope to see it… soon. Isn’t true, darling, that I’ll see it soon? Why don’t you continue with the letter? Continue, Señor Esposito. Or even better, why don’t I continue myself. It is a shame, my friend, that such a beautiful secretary doesn’t want anything to do with me! that I will never see her enchantments, or her body, or even her hands… that I will never see anything! And if you keep harassing me I'll break an ashtray against your head! I don’t want a nervous secretary. You are fired! Leave me alone! Abuser! Stop it! Why did you leave so early, mom? Because I had to go to work. Why do you have to work now? When dad was here you didn’t work. You spent the day playing with me. That is true, sweetheart. But now I have to work because dad has gone far away, very far away… and it would be a while before he returns. Are you going to leave as well, mom? Yes. Yes. Maybe with him. Alicia. Yes? I want to marry you. But… - Formally. But I cannot marry you, Señor Barrota. - Why? Because I simply don’t love you. Because you simp... I called you because I need you… I wanted to see you. I can’t do this anymore. - I already gave you a solution. Yes. To work... but nobody wants me to work decently. They all expect something else from me; a cheap and easy woman. Everything at the same time; employee and lover. - It’s terrible. They all want the same. - And are you going to kill yourself over that? I would gladly do it. I’m desperate. - Go to another country. Nobody would know you there. - Another country? Which one, for example? Panama. There you will fix your life. Go there willing to earn money and you will get it. You'll be working for dollars. And you... Why don’t you go? I was there already. No, I can’t go back. If I go they'll put me in jail. Black market, drugs. Weird guys. You know… I'd like to go to earn as much as possible. - A woman like you will earn a lot of money and in the meantime live the grand life. Tropic. Beaches, casinos, roulette. Decide, Alicia! Ok. I’ll do it! I should risk it now or never. I’ll do everything for Adolfito, anything. Let’s go, dear. I’d like to travel to Panama. - Round ticket? - Just one way… Cash or credit? - Credit… Please sign here. Add the name of your guarantor as well. - My mother, Alicia Miguez de Ahumada. Should I fill this? Yes, exactly. Take care, child, and come back soon. - Yes, mom, don’t worry. Bye… Adolfito, my dear son… I’ll see you soon. Goodbye. Can you please take me to the Continental Hotel? They’ve told me it's the best of Panama. - Sure. Is this the first time you come here? Look at these girls. You will like Panama! - Yes. Welcome to Panama, Señorita. Thanks. - Do you want to check in? - Yes, sure. Your profession, Señorita? Artist. Look… No more bets… Black 35. It seems you bring me luck. Here you are. - Thanks. Here, please accept these so we can both have fun. Thank you, you are very kind. Pick your game. I’m leaving. Can you change them, please? The gentleman is leaving. Excuse me. Your money, Señor. - Thanks. Pick your game, Señores. I am not sure if you are really a woman or a goddess. A woman, as you can see… simply a woman. - Shall we dance? Alright. Are you passing by Panama? - Yep. - When are you leaving? Today... tomorrow... the day after tomorrow... I don't know. - Why so soon? Panama is beautiful. I could show you around. The beaches, marvelous goods… I may be interested… only my husband is waiting for me. - Where? In Miami. He's a tobacco industrialist. He pays for my vices. And you, how do you pay your husband? With love. Do you think that is expensive? - No. If I could pay for you, I'd take you with me forever. You must be a millionaire. I'm very expensive and very vicious. I would like to know one of your vices. To earn money. Yes, don’t laugh. I love beautiful things. - And your husband? I told you. He pays for them. Ok. I am leaving. - What, so soon? I want to see you tomorrow. - Sure. I will stay for a few days. I am interested, but you must keep your promise - show me Panama. Good day, Señorita. - Good day. What are you getting? So wonderful! It’s difficult to choose! Can I buy something? - Pick whatever you want. So many great things! Wonderful! Let’s go, these are pretty heavy. How much? - $900. Everything is so cheap! 100, 200... It’s so beautiful! I want to keep it! Would you buy it for me? - Sure, darling. How much is it? $50. I can’t go lower. - That’s OK. All this is old Panama. For the Panamanians it's a very important historic site. I talk to you and you don’t listen. You are thinking of the bird. It’s lovely. I'll call it Perico. Adolfito will like it a lot. He loves animals. Tell him it's a memento from me, that one day I'll be lucky to meet him. He's so beautiful. He reminds me of an aunt of mine… Those are remaining ruins of pirate Morgan’s looting. Come, let’s walk a little bit more. Eternal passion has more than one language Which with kissed can't be sold Since a woman who doesn't know how to love Is not worth being called A woman A woman Must be a dreamer, charming and ardent Must give herself to love with frenetic ardor In order to be a woman You lived in the shadow, sleeping Without feeling Once they told you... Now you want to be part of life Since a woman Is not worth being called A woman Are you happy now? I want more. A lot more. You are insatiable. It cost me a lot. I gave you all I had. Where are you from? I am from Uruguay. Married to a powerful industrialist. With a rich American who supports your vices. Look, hundreds of women have passed by the hotel looking for the same thing. Love. - Love… but I immediately realized that you were not like those professionals… I don’t know… You are different. And you? What are you? A professional. - A professional? I already spent more than $1,000 on you… but it doesn’t matter. We'll form the most powerful partnership of all Panama. Where are you from? - From wherever the night finds me… or the police. - What do you mean? The police. I don’t have a citizenship. I have more than 20 passports. What country do you want me to be from? For now, I’m from Panama, is that good enough? This guy is a wiseass who thinks he can use me as he pleases… he will see. If you need anything here in Taboga, ask for Gilberto Sierra. He can solve any problem. I have a plan that can bring us a lot of money. I just needed... a partner like you. I need money, you know. I’ll do anything to get it. Brilliant! Bravo! Come on! Bravo! Come on! Bravo! Brilliant! That’s a woman! Sensational. Enchanting. My queen. Would you be my guest? It depends on your intentions with me. I want to take care of you. I have a volcano in my heart. Since I’ve seen you dance for the first time, I’ve been dreaming of having you in my arms. But you are not going to squeeze me too much, I hope… I’ll let you go whenever you say “Ay.” Can I see you bathing? I don’t know yet. You are so funny. I would love to be alone with you, but it has to be a discreet place, right? Then I'll invite you to the house of a diplomat friend of mine. They call him “The king of coconuts.” He has such a coco… I mean such a sensational house. I love diplomats! What do you do? I am a minister, but let’s talk about something else. A minister! At what time is the invitation? At 2:00. You swim so well! Don’t you want to dance with me? - I wouldn’t dare… But why? Aren’t you happy, chicken? - Of course… it’s just that the forbidden is even more delightful. Do you like the water? - Yes, but in a glass. What happens if I agree to love you as you desire? I’ll die. Bye, my sweet chicken. Sing, my chubby… You have a wonderful voice. Come, sweetie. Be careful not to get wet. Such a beautiful flower… you can’t imagine how much I like flowers. I brought this one for you. What I wanted to explain is that I’m a man with many responsibilities. What a perfume… Thanks! I've a very important role in my country. Something like... Fidel Castro in Cuba, but without a beard because they say we look alike. I’m Minister of Social Wellbeing, Agriculture and the like… Do you know how do they call me? “The Terrible.” You scare me. The truth is that you make the role justice. Shall we have a drink? Sure. Don’t you want me as Ms. Minister? I do want you, but not exactly for a ministry. Come. You first. You are naughty, minister. Do you like to dance? Ladies first. My queen, I almost smashed you. I’m sorry. - Yes. What a woman. Tell me. What would happen in your country if they learnt that you have relations with someone like me, a striptease dancer? It would be bad. My country is very strict in moral issues. But of course, I’m also a man. Really? Do you want me to show you... my passport? No need. I can see. I think it is OK, I won’t betray your feelings. But of course, if we get to love each other as you intend to, would you marry me? Marry you? The truth is that I’m married already. It would be a social scandal. My wife... is a member of the Society for Charity and Morals. Yes, I know. They are perfectly moral… so it’s logic that when you travel abroad you want to have a little fun. That’s true. When I cross the border I become a little naughty. Chubby, you are a cynic, but I adore you. What would you give me in exchange for some love? I would give you everything, except my name and reputation. My God! I think I am going to faint. I’m not feeling that good. My love, do we look alike? - We are the same. I want to be your Fidelita, then. I would love you to be my female. Ok. I’ll give you everything. - Everything? - Everything. Really? - Everything, everything… - Aren’t you going to bargain later… When? - Whenever you want. Because I have to take my pills. No, no, I can’t breath. My minister. My minister… what a pair of ministers! Ah, Fidel. I am going to be your Fidelita. Do you like it? - How couldn’t it! I am going crazy. Tonight, after the show, I’ll wait for you in my room. I just want you to send me a champagne bottle, well chilled, a French perfume, and lots of roses, very red ones, redder than these… and now, as an advance, I’ll give you a big kiss, a big, big kiss. Come in, chicken. How are you? My breathing is about to stop. You'll never forget the day we'll spend together, better say, the night… Can I sit down? - Yes. Do you want to dance? Do you like the music? I like chicken breast better. How sweet. Let’s dance… Ok. What a landing…. I must go to the bathroom, mamacita. I work better in my pajamas. This tickles… I didn’t know you were a masseur. I’ll better take your shoes off. Forget the shoes, take my pants off. For our friendship. I am wetting the bed. The champagne was great. Yes, everything is becoming great. What are you doing? No! I almost killed you! Leave me alone. Come on, chubby, don’t run away from me. My suspicions are true! We are busy. What are you doing there? This is how you betray your husband! He wanted it. - No, I was tricked into coming here. Tell him, I am the plumber. Disgusting pig! You'll remember me! Oh, no! He is photographing my belly! He is crazy! Leave, what do you think? That I need mementos? Come, come… Uncover your face! Is he still here? Ok. The roll is over… you can continue. I’ll ask for a divorce, with this evidence! Good bye, plumber, have fun! I don’t want to have any business with you. This is a scandal! You humiliated me. You didn’t tell me you were married. What did I come here for? To marry? You should know that my reputation is not very solid. I’m confused and I don’t know what to do. You are very revengeful. I’m leaving. What about the promised love and the champagne! What champagne? With the scandal I’ll have now… What is the ministry going to say? What about my countrymen, mi mom, my classmates, my uncle, my relatives, my neighbors. Get me the photos at any expense. He won’t give them to me. I’m sure. It's the evidence he'll use for our divorce. I’m so nervous… I don’t know what to do… What shall we do darling? I’ll get a divorce and then we can marry. I adore you. Leave me alone. I can see all those photos published in my country’s tabloids. You are just thinking about yourself, what about me? What should I do? I know this is a trap. Everything was planned. They’ve told me stories like this one, but I’m the protagonist now. Seriously, how much would those photos cost? I’ll get them for you. I what the photos! Will $2,000 be enough? He gave you the money right away? - When he saw the photos he wanted to die. What a dumb fatso. What a beautiful watch. - Do you like it? It’s wonderful. Can I sit? - Of course. It’s wonderful. Are you from this tropical country? No, I’m in transit. I'm waiting for my husband. I was so bored… that’s why I approached you. What a handsome man! Do you know him? Yes. They introduced him to me. He's the son of a rich industrialist. The country’s playboy of the moment. He is so tall! Excuse me. I want to introduce myself. Martin Gaiz Achabal. A pleasure. - I couldn’t resist the desire to talk with such beautiful ladies. A pleasure. - Ms. Ramsey, nice to meet you. Can I sit? - Why not. I'm not sure if the lady might objection. None. Thank you. All the time I followed you, I've been admiring you. What do you mean by that? - I’m crazy about you. Forgive me, Señora, and don’t be surprised. Ms. Ramsey is a perfect candidate for Oscar. These look great. How did it go with Ms. Ramsey? Very good. I took her to Taboga Island. It was hard work. How much money did she give you? - Not enough. But not bad for the first time. Keep it. Let me see… Another pose please! Bye. You did well… Mr. Ambassador, you are very impetuous. You'll kill me. You have an internal fire that drives me crazy. Ay, Mr. Ambassador, come with me. These are perfect. No, no photos, no! My wife will kill me. Bye. Here I found peace, work and a kind of happiness… I say “kind of” because I'll never be happy having you far away, my Adolfito, with whom I dream day and night. Any sacrifice is small if it guarantees your happiness and lack of privations. Letters from mother, from mom. Well, I’m very rich and I’m in Panama for a few days. Yes, I understand. So you want to have fun, isn’t it? Yes, that's it. How much? - Let’s say $2,000, for example. It's fine. Come in. Hello… What do you think… am I worth the 2,000, the $2,000? Five… $5,000, Good morning. - Good morning. A transfer to Buenos Aires. - Of course, Señorita. How beautiful… you look great! Girl, if a film director saw you, he'd hire you. Bye. What are you reading, Adolfito? - From Alicia, my mama. Your dad doesn't write you? - No. He died. Does you mother never come to see you? She's working far away. But one day she'll come. My mom is a very important lady and very good. I love her very much. You have to leave your room as soon as possible. This hotel can't tolerate your misconduct. The Management. Listen, what happened with that blond from the other night… what was her name? Jenny. - He knows her well. A good dinner. - With dessert? And liquor… Goodbye, beautiful. Wait a minute. Something sparked my interest. See you tomorrow. - See you. Where are you going to in such a rush? Somebody waiting for you? No, I'm not in a rush. I just want to rest. I'd like to take you out for dinner. - Not today. I'm really tired. You put me in a compromised situation. Some other time. - I hope soon. Here you have my card. You can reach me here pretty easily. Let’s go, Alicia. - The gentleman is a friend. - Very pleased, Señor. A pleasure… Let’s go. - What a pest! She cannot take care of anybody outside work. - Let's go. You understand, don’t you? You can’t deny it. You are very photogenic! Is this possible? It’s just a few dollars. Isn’t your peace of mind worth it? I’ve never seen such a malicious act! Wherever I find her I’ll kill her. And you as well. You won’t dare killing me. I have two kids far away. I need to send them money urgently. Come on, come on... without vacillation. - Promise me you will return. I’ll give you whatever you want but don’t leave me. I have money, but I need your love. - Alright. For love or for fear, you'll give me more money. That way, I’ll always be close to you. You brought the money from the last client, I imagine. She wanted to kill me. This is all could get from her. Keep it. It must be worth something. What do I want a gun for? I want money. She doesn’t have it. She can’t get it. And the photos? I have one… It seems that I've lost the rest. Don't think I'm stupid, Oscar. This has happened several times now. I give you whatever I get. I’ve been straight and loyal to you. But - no tricks. You know I will never leave you. That I love you very much. Me too. I love you for being a scoundrel. Señora, phone for you. Thanks. Ricardo Allende speaking. - Yes, Ricardo. I called you earlier. Yes, they told me. I'm at the restaurant Santi, opposite the Continental Hotel. Join me for dinner. - Ok. Thanks. I’ll be there in a little while. - Magnificent. I’ll wait for you then. I’m happy you accepted my invitation. Yes, Ricardo, me too. It’s just that I'd like to believe in you. I can’t take you off my mind I feel something for you that... I’ve never felt for any other woman. What, for example? I don't know if it is love, but I dream of having you in my arms. Yes, Alicia. Don’t take me for a fool I know that you can’t speak to a woman like you in any other way. And least of all to trick you like a child. You don’t have any reasons to pretend. Yes, Ricardo... suddenly falls in the same trap he has prepared. I’m not sure what other men told you, but I can tell you that I like you. What they always say… that they love me, that they want me, that I could be the woman of their lives… but… Not that far… but I do live surrounded by frivolities and daily surprises. - You were about to get married, I guess. Yes, many times, but I changed my mind on time. To get married you must... be a bit crazy. Crazy from love. Let’s keep walking. I would like to see this for now. We’ll have time to talk later. The señora's home? No, señor, she went out with a man who came to pick her up in a red car. Where did she go? - I’m not sure. I think they went to Miraflores, close to the canal. This is so beautiful. It’s one of the seven marvels of the world. - Yes. Yes, and you are the eight. It seems that they are following us. - Who? A friend. I think he wants to get closer. Let’s make your friend run… Stop the car, Ricardo. Let’s see what he wants. - If you wish. Let’s see what your friend wants. Let’s go! Let’s go, I said. - Relax, don’t make a scene!- Let's go! You are an idiot! - This woman is with me. Leave or I’ll kill you! - Kill me? Fucking bastard. Ricardo, please. Son of a bitch, we'll get even, you and me! This will not stay this way. Are you happy now? You’ve provoked an incident that should've never been provoked. He's very important in Panama. I don’t care! - I do. - I don’t want any more photos or money. I care about you. This is not business. I know who he is. You are interested, aren’t you? - And if that were the case, what? You don’t own me. You and I are nothing, nothing. That man interests me. You have to understand it for once. I’m tired of you. I'm fed up. Don’t you get it for once? Alicia! But I love you, Alicia! Leave me alone. - Don’t you realize that I'm jealous, really jealous now? I really love you. I want to change our lives, go far away. With you. I love you. Please, not here. Be careful. What happened today is not over. I know who you are. I know your past. Many have been kicked out from this country. Who are you to talk to me like that! - An offended man, a good man who is talking to a criminal, a pimp. Grab him. Step back! Or I’ll fire! Get back! Good night. After such a scandal, I have to go see Ricardo. They have a plot against Oscar and me. I’ll go tomorrow. I came to see you because I need your help. They are plotting something against me and Oscar. - Oscar? I know more that you could imagine. Oscar, your famous Oscar, is an international criminal. We’ve seen many like him here. Well... I know a lot of things about you as well, but they matter little… You're an enchantment anyway. You know, I like you a lot. Leave me. I can’t think about this now. Please help me. It’s a lie. Everything they say is a lie! - A lie? Yes. - You are mistaken. Secretary, please make an appointment with Mayor Nelson of the National Guard. Do you know this woman? - No. Honestly, I don’t know who she is. - Yes, you know her. You have her gun. She is a witness and could talk at any time. She has given him more than $10,000 for obscene photographs that he gives to her one by one. You are free for now. This good friend has paid for you, but we are looking and hope to find Oscar Miranda, Luis Depiero, Alfredo Gaiza, Manuel Farina… the pseudonyms continue. You... are not the first to fall into this felon’s trap. He is an international criminal, an assassin. Furthermore, he has a few murders in his records. As soon as I find him, I'll kill him. It’s a shame that a woman like you has fallen so low! I’m guilty as well. I started all this because I needed to, for an uncontainable desire to live and to save another life. I didn’t have a choice, señor. Calm down. Calm down, Alicia. We will solve this. Yes. Yes. I will fix it as well. Let’s go. - Thanks. What are you going to do? To organize my thoughts. Can you understand? I’m desperate. It can't be. I’ll go with you. - No! - You shouldn’t be alone. - I want to be alone. I need to be by myself. Goodbye, Ricardo. Excuse me, where is Gilberto’s Hotel? - Straight ahead, to the left. I was desperate to hear from you. - Leave me. Don’t touch me. It’s a shame what I learned, you bastard! - Come to my room. I know everything about you. You are a criminal. A fake. I even learned that the woman who gave you the gun also gave you more than $10,000 and you kept that from me. Here I have them, Keep them. I want them to be yours. You are an assassin. I was like a child in your hands. You did whatever you wanted with me. I won't not see you again. Did they follow you? I don’t know. But run! It’s the National Guard! Mayor Nelsen speaking! You will pay with your life if you resist. I’m going to take my chance. I’ll look for you one day. Don’t, don’t go. They will kill you! Men who had followed the path I followed, they win or lose. Today I lose. Give yourself up immediately! Oscar, give yourself up. There is no way out! I love you, Alicia. Give yourself up immediately. Do not resist. Don’t play with the life of an innocent victim. Open the door. Come clean. Let’s bring the door down Don’t kill him, I beg you! I beg you! He escaped. Let's go! Are you happy now? - I just did my job. He is dead. Now you know my whole story, a story without importance. The story of a love, of many loves. It's too late I realize that I'm in love with you. if you don’t come back, I’ll look for you in Buenos Aires. There is no need, Ricardo. I'll be back. The tickets. Thanks. Good trip! I am taking it for Adolfito. It’s beautiful. Goodbye, Ricardo. You’ve been a great friend. At least I contributed with the birdcage. Yes. - What’s his name? Perico. Goodbye, Ricardo. Farewell. - See you soon. This is Adolfito’s dog. He loves it so much. Cheyenne is his name. We always had news about you through your mother. And the boy, how is he doing? - Very good. Do you want to see him? - Imagine. I am desperate. It’s been so long since I last saw him. Martinez. - Yes, señor. Please tell the boy Adolfo Zuniga that his mother is waiting for him. Will you accompany me, señora? - Of course. Adolfito, there is your mom who wants to see you. Go. Did you see? My mom is a very important lady. My boy! You came back, mom! My boy. Don’t cry, mom. Are you happy Adolfito? - Yes, mom. Here you have your dog. - I'm so lucky you came, Cheyenne. Let’s go. I’ll bring him back on Monday. - Sure, señora. - Thanks for everything. Subtitles: bertmorane87
