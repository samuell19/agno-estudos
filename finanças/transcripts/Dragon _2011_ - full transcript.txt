Xiaotian, don't be afraid, it'll be over quickly I'll pull on three One Where's the tooth? Xiaotian, you tricked me! I want to keep my tooth Xiaotian! You tricked me! I'll get you Father What is it, son? My tooth hurts Your tooth hurts Let me have a look Which one hurts? Open wider This one? Show me Zhigen's wife visited the paper mill yesterday to chastise the people who didn't go to the celebration for her newborn I was busy with an order, so I ran Really? Judging from her body, she's pregnant again She is? Mother When will you have another child? Why do you ask? He talks too much Let's replace him No Yes, we will No Yes No Jinxi Would you like some five spice stew That's alright I already ate Oh, that's right... I almost forgot, you're a vegetarian This village has prospered since the paper mill opened More and more visitors come here to buy paper Welcome, gentlemen You sell wine? You're lucky We make our own wine, "Thousand Springs" It may be rustic But it is as good as old wine Give me four pints Yes, sir Wait Give me eight Eight pints of "Thousand Springs" Are you martial artists? On your way to the county town? I must tell you A few months ago a father and daughter duo of your trade passed through here They sold me some "Mighty Pills" I can attest that they were very potent! Sir, your wine... This wine is also called "Fragrant Bottle" or "Drop at the Door" It tastes horrible Waiter Does this village have a general store? Yes... It's across that way We're here for money Are you here to buy paper? We're here for money Do you have a letter of credit? We're here for the money Understood? Where's the money? You cut me, idiot Help... Father! Father, are you alright? Toes, no fatal wound Chest, no fatal wound Lower back, no fatal wound Genitals, no fatal wound Shoulders, no fatal wound Fangzheng! Watch your children Knees, no fatal wound Palms, no fatal wound Soles, no fatal wound These herbs will kill the smell Ankles, no fatal wound Insteps, no fatal wound "Robbery convict -Yan Dongsheng" Your honor Xu, you seem flustered What's the matter? I discovered that one of the dead men is the top ten wanted criminal Yan Dongsheng Your honor must remember Yan was the mastermind behind countless heinous crimes We brought him to justice After being held for three days, he overpowered us and escaped You're saying that this Liu Jinxi accidentally captured Yan Dongsheng? Yes Not only captured but killed the criminal Yes It means the case was solved in "my" jurisdiction Good. Excellent! Make arrangements for me to meet this hero Not only meet but also thank him on behalf of the people and the county government Let's go Who is Liu Jinxi? Here, sir. Coming Countymen We've solved the case The dead man is Yan Dongsheng He's the notorious criminal responsible for countless murders Thanks to our hero Liu Jinxi Yan was brought to justice This is a blessing Jinxi wants to eat pears To the market he hurries, here and there Time to core and pare the pears Quickly Jinxi, eat the pears He fights the thief, and peels his skin Ayu can't believe what she sees Tonight she will reward Jinxi Reward Jinxi July 1917, the 11 th fortnight... I was sent to Liu village Crime Scene: General Store People involved: a papermaker, two fugitives How could an unarmed paper maker defeat a trained killer like Yan Dongsheng? Do you know Liu Jinxi? Everyone knows everyone in this village Has he always lived here? Well, no No He moved here when he married Ayu he adopted the clan name, Liu His real family name was Gong Gong? Fangzheng was only a few years old When his father left Ayu married Jinxi and gave birth to Xiaotian I once asked Jinxi Where are you from? He said, Gong village He said he came from a family of butchers Butchers? Bloodshot eyes indicate a brain hemorrhage Yan received a heavy blow to the temple below which the vagus... ...nerve serves a key function: it regulates the heartbeat Traumatizing it can stop the heart To damage the vagus Nerve... ...with a single blow to the temple requires extraordinary skills Only three fugitives killers are capable of such a thing: Fang Rishou He was once a war hero... but was later discharged for violent behavior Became a gambling addict... he squandered his fortune He set fire to the gambling den Dozens were killed He vanished afterwards Zhao Yiguang, also known as The Eye Collector He ambushed the Tai Fen Convoy The victims had their eyes gouged... ...and tongues removed It took them three days to die Bu yuan... a psychopath famous for his knife skills He slit his victims' veins and drained their blood He even threw their heads into boiling soup pots He arrived just after the Spring festival One afternoon he came to the tavern Wine, please Yes, sir Sir, what are these? What? You don't know? They're amulets on the first day of spring men wear them on the left arm and women wear them on the right to ward off ghosts He claimed that his village didn't practice the same ritual His home village was in Lianzhou It left a deep impression on me Lianzhou... Lianzhou have amulets too They do I hope there's not a problem Jinxi is a good man Leave it I don't like the smell of fish bladder Mrs. Tung said there's a potion I can take to prevent pregnancy It's mercury; it's poison It will harm your body What if I get pregnant? Then we'll have another baby You... seem upset? No, I was just thinking about the two men that died But they were bad men Officials said they were going to rob a supply convoy nearby They were just passing through So... Jinxi, you did good The detective may be a bit eccentric but he doesn't accept bribes so he must be a good man We should offer him a meal on the house Men are just sacks of stinking fluids with no redeeming qualities A good man? Good or bad, it's determined by our physiology The Ren-ying meridian controls hunger His Ren-ying appears to be overdeveloped The short man was a born glutton Give me four pints... Wait... Give me eight Wine impaired his Qi, a contributing factor to his cardiac arrest He died because his Ren-ying meridian betrayed him As for me my weakness is my Shanzhong meridian It controls emotions and gives us empathy My Shanzhong meridian is overdeveloped It makes me too empathetic; it almost cost me my life once I caught a young man who stole from his adoptive parents But I send him home I put humanity above the law I never imagined that he would poison our food Both his parents died I sustained internal injuries That's why I use two needles: one in the Shanzhong, to suppress my empathy; the other in the Tientu, to control the posion I treat my body and my personality flaws at the same time Since then "he" follows me around He says: you can't trust humanity Only physiology and the law don't lie It's you There's no door No need for doors here Looking for Jinxi? He's not home No I've come to see you I'll make you congee for your cough Please don't bother It's no trouble at all No trouble at all Last night, the tavern keeper told me that Jinxi only joined the clan a few years ago His last name wasn't Liu originally? It was five years ago At that time... I was pregnant with Xiaotian I asked for his name to be added in the clan records That's all Well then... how did you two meet? It was a long time ago. I can barely remember On that day he was just passing through He told me he had a fight with his family And he'd run away He never talks about his family Unresolved conflicts? They can be resolved Did Jinxi know your former husband? No Did I... say something wrong? That man abandoned us just like that He said, "I'll see you tonight" It turned out... he'd been planning to leave He even took his favourite pillow with him He abandoned his wife and child Jinxi doesn't need to know... such a man Sometimes Jinxi says to me I'll see you tonight I tell him not to use those words Not to say them... On the subject of his family, I'm afraid if I asked he might just disappear too First interrogation of the suspect; July, 12th fortnight Describe your fight with Yan Dongsheng I think... it was like this... I grabbed him like this Continue I held onto him I refused to let go then he spun me around You used leverage against Yan's brutal force No wonder Yan couldn't shake you How did Yan lose his ear? It was chaos I think... the short man came at me... ...from behind with a sword I ducked of course then I heard a scream I didn't know what was happening Are you saying... that they wounded each other? Yes! They cut one another Just like that How odd How did the short man die? I know! I saw it He ran from here to there He flew up there and BANG - he fell Then he died You let him throw you You used your hands to bounce back up then summoned Qi energy You were ready to kill You hit his Yunmen meridian It caused a blood clot... blocking the blood flow to the coronary arteries resulting in cardiac arrest The tall man broke the door and dragged me out here He pushed me into the pond and tried to drown me I fought for my life But I couldn't breathe underwater How did Yan die? It was you who dragged him into the pond Water resistance blunted the force of Yan's blows A direct blow to the vagus Nerves would either kill the victim or leave him paralyzed for life It was a vicious blow; you must have wanted Yan dead Liu Jinxi What kind of man are you? I was lucky Thank you for everything - I'll see you tomorrow. - Tomorrow? You have more questions? I'll know very soon In recognition of Jinxi's heroism and contribution to the village the village has decided to sponsor Fangzheng's college studies and county examination fees If he does well in the examination we'll host a celebration ceremony and make all the arrangements Ayu Will Fangzheng be an adult this year? Yes, he's twelve After the rites he will receive new clothes and be considered an adult You and your husband have worked hard to raise your children When they grow up and succeed you will be proud parents It's the dream of all parents Thank you The House of Jinxi is surrounded by a water of jade I foresee a man of prominence Impossible! You're breathing more heavily than me For a martial artist like you each breath should last at least ten counts How else could you collect Qi in your body's core? Two counts This can't be Let me help you it's heavy, sir! - No need, really. - It's alright. It's heavy, sir Help! Jinxi, hang on! Don't move! Help! Given his weight and the height he fell the branches should have broken by the force of the impact Density could also be a factor If he could counter the momentum of the fall with an equal upward force he might stop the fall But his body is 800 times denser than air Unless he can shift his body density at will? He defied gravity with "Qinggong" Are you alright? If you hadn't come today I wouldn't have fallen It's karma It was an accident No What I mean to say is: the fabric of existence is composed of a myriad of karmic threads Nothing exists in and of itself; everything is connected For example if I hadn't come to this village I wouldn't have met Ayu If her husband hadn't left I would't have married her If I hadn't gone to the store I wouldn't have seen the criminals and they wouldn't have died Then you wouldn't have come here No one truly has free will When one man sins we all share his sin We are all accomplices Are you saying that a killer doesn't have free will when he kills? He was conditioned to the act And when he kills Because we're all part of that sin we're all accomplices? I wasn't thinking of killers I found no proof Then leave him alone He's a reformed man We're not here to reform criminals Then what's our purpose? To serve the law If the law doesn't help reform people What good is it? A true martial artist can control the flow of his Qi and his mental state He may appear to be a good man but he's still a killer Go to Lianzhou and dig around Once you get the information report back to me Baijiu Take care of yourself Don't forget your condition You can't actually fight What are you saying? He might be a trained killer, you said so yourself You think... he's going to silence me? Just be careful Have some more Where're your manners? We have a guest Have some more Have more Xu Baijiu Where are you from? Fucheng, Chaozhou It's not far I hear your hometown is in Lianzhou? It's so far away What brought you out here? You either love it here or hate where you come from Yes, I like it here Fucheng is close You must go home often? I hear the weather there is nice Well... Since my father died and my mother remarried I seldom visit But I sometimes get homesick I heard that you left home ten years ago Don't you ever miss it? Ever thought about going back? No, I haven't Are you telling me that Xiaotian's never met his grandfather Eat up, the food is getting cold Fangzheng said... that you owned a horse before It's rare for most families to own horses Don't you think? What kind of horse? Yes... I had a horse once But my father killed it My father saw that I loved my horse so he killed it and fed me its flesh I ate it without knowing Then he said if I could stomach eating my horse I could face anything nothing could defeat me Would you go back to a place like that? Did it taste good? Not at all It's late Yes, it's late I could... have a shower first Am I sleeping upstairs? I'll find my own way Please continue After years of killing the murderer's face becomes pale the eyes turn green even the air around the body grows cold Why aren't your eyes green? Thirsty? I'm thirsty Sons of the clan you've reached the age of adulthood From this day forth you must dress and conduct yourself as men Protect and serve the emperor Liu Kaitai Liu Fangzheng Liu Tianxiang With these clothes, you become a man Bow And again Offer incense You looked quite moved Were you? I've always wondered why you left home and changed your name What happened ten years ago? I needed a change I caught a young thief once I thought he would reform... ...and let him go home I never imagined that he would poison his own parents Tell me If he had run away and changed his name could he really have changed? I don't think so You want to arrest me I was a convicted murderer I was in Lianzhou prison for ten years I was originally from Gong village My father was a butcher another butcher borrowed money from us... ...but never paid us back My father said men are no different from animals But this man is lower than an animal because he's greedy My father handed me his cleaver I hacked the man to death I felt nothing I suddenly froze I heard the man's son crying The child was still alive He was staring at me my father was wrong Humans are not animals A murder sentence should be more than ten years There was an amnesty ten years ago I knew I had to change I had to leave my hometown to live a new life I needed to be Liu Jinxi I almost succeeded Father, the market is open Please leave us alone Please! Father! We need to hurry! Xu Baijiu, you should come too! I'll be right there Hurry! Alright Let's go He's surrounded by an energy field? He's radiating Qi energy repelling even the flies He lied to you How could a common butcher develop... ...such powerful Qi? Take this, I guarantee it won't cut him You told me it wouldn't cut? Pine trees are prickly Whoever dares to bully Liu Jinxi? Now you have to deal with me! You frown when you've done wrong Each new moon has two prongs Xu Baijiu, go away! No boat will ferry you along Your letters will have no name Have you no shame? I've verified the facts There's no Gong village in Lianzhou There were no butchers in Lianzhou with a last name Gong But ten years ago... a butcher's family was massacred A butcher named Zhang borrowed money but didn't repay the loan Their flest was used for savory bun filling and distributed to unsuspecting villagers The villagers said they had never tasted anything so delicious You must be familiar with the case Are you alright? I'm fine, Captain You'll get used to it in time Listen The 72 Demons are the last surviving Tanguts They used to be civilized, like us But after the massacre of 800,000 Tanguts The survivors became savages They ate raw meat and left their dead unburied Hunger for revenge is what keeps them alive I guess it's karma After this killing... Tang Long, the second in command, went missing Liu Jinxi has lived here for exactly... ten years, hasn't he? So he is Tang Long You disappeared for 10 years but you were never imprisoned You Killed the butcher's family You 're not a butcher's son You were the 72 Demons' second in command I must return to the county to get a warrant for his arrest! Xu Baijiu, where are you going? Are you leaving? Yes I suppose your work here is done? You healed quickly The doctor said you nearly cut a major artery That would have killed me You were lucky May be you're lucky? I know a shortcut Let me lead the way Otherwise, you won't make it to Feng County by nightfall That would be a shame Few people know about this path I came across it by accident Will you close the case after you leave here? Yes I will You don't believe me? We part ways here Keep going straight After an hour... you'll reach the main road Keep walking... and you'll find Feng County What are you waiting for? Goodbye, then That road did lead to Feng County Why didn't he kill me? Xu Baijiu You've worked for me for ten years and still so naive? Captain, it's different this time I could lend you the men under my command but they're just a bunch of cowards and bums Hire some outlaws but using criminals to stop a criminal... is playing with fire Xu Baijiu Just let it go Tang Long is not a wanted criminal why do you want a warrant? The 72 Demons are notorious outlaws And Tang Long is their second in command Where's the proof? Even if you bribe the judge for a warrant you're risking your life I'll report the judge! Nonsense! How much do you want? 20 taels of silver What? Where will I find that? I only receive 4 taels a year! Business hours are over Come back to me when you have the money I never expected to need help from this person: My wife I'll pay you back Is business good? I'll burn incense for your father Don't bother I'm afraid father wouldn't like it Before he's passed away... he made it clear What about you? You still blame me? Does it matter? Father was wrong to sell fake medicine But the medicine... didn't cost any lives He got on his knees and begged for your mercy you wouldn't let go What did it feel like? It wasn't up to me It's the law He was only guilty of selling fake medicine he didn't need to kill himself I know you said it before You'll never forgive me you still don't understand Not forgiving... you'd have to still care Is the law really more important than humanity? Captain what has the world come to? Whatever the world has become you have no choice but to be part of it Tsu Kun, where're you taking me? where's my reward? Whatever you have to say, tell Master yourself Are you saying Tang Long is in the village that you mentioned? Yes And... he has two sons? Yes One is his One is from his wife's previous marriage Are you telling me this... because you think I want information about Tang Long? Tsu Kun, what's going on? Answer me You didn't go to the 36 Constellations You didn't go to the Black Dragon Gang Instead, you came here Because you know... we have a connection with Tang Long True? No Master... it's not... It's not what you think Tsu Kun, help me Tell him who Tang Long is Tang Long... is the son of our Master You came here with the information so that I would kill my own son You... How dare you! Tell me Should I kill Tang Long? Well? Should I kill him? None of you can match him None of you can match Tang Long! Master wants to... bring Tang Long back! Oma-miba-mihon... Did you ever work the land? I did What are they reciting? They're praying for souls to be released from purgatory You see when you till the earth you can't avoid harming the small creatures in it Jinxi performed a brave deed by killing two criminals we make a record of Jinxi's great deed Jinxi is a man of integrity His bravery and kindness are a blessing to us and an example for our youth We will remember and be inspired... Go down on your knees Kneel! I am Liu Jinxi Liu Jinxi? I am Liu Jinxi Tell the truth! Father! Who are you? This is a family matter so shut up! Shut up! Be quiet! You deny you're Tang Long My house is on fire Help! I'm not going back You know that "he" wants you back He won't give up You are Tang Long You still are I'll get you some water The chief told us to shelter in the fortress That's why I'm packing I've already packed your belongings Good What do you mean? I can't go with you So we're not going either We should... we should leave and start a new life somewhere else it's useless... How can you say that? Have some water Don't say that It's too late, do you understand Thanks for letting me be Liu Jinxi But I'm not Liu Jinxi Jinxi That day by the pond if the woman you met hadn't been me Would you have stayed? Sir, spare my children Kill me if you must! They're innocent Sir, I beg you Sir... Please don't... Sir... I'm sorry What happened? It must be the 72 Demons It doesn't look good Even if we capture Tang Long, the Demons might still ambush us Nothing will stop them we should just let them kill each other and return later What for, if he's dead? He'll receive a death sentence anyway Xu Baijiu, what do you really want? I must bring him to justice You promised never to return? Is this Tang Long? Tang Long of the 72 Demons They will come back Let's wait nearby let them kill each other No, we should all stay Stay if you want to We're leaving We'll return for the corpses The other day in the forest... why didn't you kill me? You promised never to return And you believed me? I did Ayu told me something She said: Xu Baijiu is a good man He just doesn't know it There is no such thing Good men don't exist The human body is amazing, it can trick you I want to use your body to trick them Tang Long You must die There are three stages of death: the brink, the degeneration and the final death in the first stage, we appear dead Most people will be fooled I want you to enter this first stage you'll be in a coma Most people can't tell the difference He's dead? But to trick the 72 demons you need to enter the more dangerous second stage When the demons arrive I'll press the vagus Nerve in your neck to induce the degeneration stage your breathing and pulse will stop you 'll show no signs of life you'll lose all sensation You can stay in this condition up to 15 minutes if I fail to revive you in time you will truly be dead! We're taking Tang Long's body to the court Step aside! You drove Tang Long to his death! # Duo-a... # # nuo-zi-die # # The dead will not return # # come back # # The soul will return... # Which one of you is Tang Long's son? Tell me, which one of you is Tang Long's son? His name is Xiaotian He's four years old Tang Long used this hand to kill I'm returning this murderous arm to the clan I'm done with the 72 Demons You choose a woman and a child over your own home? Our brother Tang Long... is dead Our brother Tang Long is dead! You still need to tell the Master He's waiting for you at home very nice... Sing again, grandfather loves it Altogether, the thumb, index and middle finger sing an opera for the little sister Grandfather loves to hear children sing middle finger, sing an opera for the little sister very nice... You should sing for grandfather every day Father What happened? I'm no longer with the 72 Demons Everyone has arrived Everyone is here Let's eat When your father was little he looked just like me especially when he was angry My splitting image Even if he got lost people would send him back to me Don't you agree? Why do you nod? Look at him now He doesn't look like me anymore But my grandson does much more than he ever did The beans are good Xiaotian Have some beanie Beanie beanie, yummy yummy Eat beanie or be skinny I didn't tell you to sing Beanie beanie, yummy yummy Eat beanie or be skinny I didn't tell you to sing Beanie beanie, yummy yummy Eat beanie or be skinny I didn't tell you to sing I beg you, please Please stop, I beg you... Stop Children must do as they're told When your father was little he hated it when I was away Once he stripped the leaves... ...from the tree in front of the house I asked him what happened He said: I once promised him when all the leaves had fallen I would return That's why he stripped all the leaves off Then he said: the leaves were long gone but why were you still not back? In the end, I burned the tree down I hated it... for disappointing my son Bastard! After that Everytime I go out my son made me take him with me He said: Now the tree is gone how will you come home? I've cut off my arm for you We're not related anymore I will let you go I'm a fair man When one leaves... another takes his place Your blood is mine His blood is mine too Your blood... It is not the blood of a Tangut anymore! Your blood is vile! The world has abandoned us Tanguts How could you forget? How could you raise a family like you're one of them? You are a traitor There's a needle in his heel... We need another one! You were given to me by God But, he let you betray me Don't blame me For killing you! This investigation is now closed October 1917, 18th fortnight Xiaotian More rice or more soup? Soup Eat slowly Jinxi I'll see you tonight
