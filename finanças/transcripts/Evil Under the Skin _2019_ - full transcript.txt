I told you I was going for a walk. No, you didn't. Yeah, yeah, I remember you said you were going swimming and then... Then what? I thought maybe, I thought that maybe something happened. Mom, I am right here. Oh, I know. Never mind. (SCOFFS) Let's go, let's go get up and go back inside. I'm lazy, you should be lazy too. Maybe it's just because I'm younger. I don't need all the rest. Oh, you're younger. - Yeah, I don't know. - That has nothing to do with it. That is just numbers. Means nothing. (LAUGHS) Wow, that was very deep and profound. Now, let's see how fast that rickety old body can run. (WAVES LAPPING) (BOTH LAUGH) Hey, cheaters never win! (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) (WAVES LAPPING) (LAUGHS) - Oh! - Uh, ha, ha! - Whoo! - Roselee! Roselee, open up. Open up. (LAUGHS) What's the magic word? I am not playing that game with you. Kinda looks like you're gonna play this game. Oh, princess. (LAUGHS) Uh, you know, I could, oh. ROSELEE: What? You ain't got nothing on me, sheriff. Mm, I could post drab picture of you on Facebook. (SCOFFS) Oh, that's too easy. (LAUGHS) You wouldn't dare. You're right. 'Cause you know why? I've got this photo of you with your braces on and your clarinet. (SIGHS) - Oh, and that pretty little - Oh, okay. sweater you wore that gran-gran made for you. You made me play that stupid instrument, though. That's a dirty pull. Hmm, princess, I'm the sheriff, and the sheriff says "Open up" and the word is blackmail. (ROSELEE CHUCKLES) - (DOOR SCRAPES) - Hi there. (LAUGHS) - Thank you. - There, are you proud of yourself? Using my childhood against me. Shameful. But effective. And also, just one more thing. What? I got the shower first! (OMINOUS MUSIC) I don't know. I mean, I want to. You know that. Of course you do. I don't know. You don't think it's kinda, kinda weird? (BIRDS CHIRP) Look, I'm not saying that. Well, you're the one that saw her. You heard her talking about her daughter. Oh yeah, I did. And this is how it starts. This is how it always starts. All right, Matt. You need to relax. You know, I think I need to be a little more careful. So do you. That place creeps me the fuck out. The noises and the screams. I just... Oh my God. I can still hear 'em. Oh please, listen. I know what you want. I know what you need more than anyone. Sis has your back. - Always. - Yeah. Can we talk about this tomorrow? No, no. They should be gone tomorrow. I'm already one step ahead of you, sis. - How's that? - I checked the list. They're here through the weekend. Oh, wow. There he is. My little opportunist. Always looking for that right angle. Hmm? (CHUCKLES) You know what? Are you ready for the best weekend of our lives? (CHUCKLES) Oh yeah. (INTENSE MUSIC) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) (CHUCKLES) Mom, what are you doing? What does it look I'm doing? It's fucking eight at night. - (SCOFFS) - Language. For fuck's sake, I raised you better than that, Lee. It's our third night here. It calls for shots. Not knitting or tea drinking or 12th century cabinet making. Fun, fun, fun! It calls for tea, darling. I don't know. I feel like staying warm and tucking in early. (CHUCKLES) Well thank you, Captain Excitement. You can do what you want, but not me. Lee, would you put some clothes on. (GLASS TAPS) No. Lee! (SIGHS) Oh my God. Are those your pajamas now? Yeah, sometimes I wear even less than this. It's hot in here. And I'm fine just like this. Mm. You know that I had trouble keeping your diapers on when you were a child. What if somebody comes to the door, huh? (CHUCKLES) It's late. Nobody cares about boobies. We're in Oregon. Remember when we went country fair last year and there was boobies everywhere. (INTENSE MUSIC) (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) (INTENSE MUSIC) Mom? Mom? Mom? (SNAPS FINGERS) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Oh, sorry. (BOTTLE CLINKS) (SIGHS) Hmm, that looks good. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) You want one? Oh, all right. (CHUCKLES) Just one. Promise. (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) What's wrong, Lee? Mom, where you mad when I left? I mean, I know Dale wasn't right for me. I know now that he wasn't right for me, but where you mad? No, princess, I was not mad. I was concerned about you. You left for year with this guy that I didn't know, and what I did know, I did not like. Well, I mean, learn from experiences, right? Mm. Mm. It was good for me, though. Being out in the middle of nowhere, Saskatchewan. Made me realize that it wasn't the right decision. And then you bring me out here to the middle of nowhere to bond. I think I've really had my fill of wilderness. Oh, you needed this, baby. I needed this, you know? Really just needed to reconnect. Plus, I know you're having a great time. (SCOFFS) (CHUCKLES) I am not the great party buddy, I agree, but you know, this is our time. We get to connect with each other. Thanks, Mom. You're welcome. And you know, I lied to you, huh? About what? I think I'm gonna have to have another shot. (LAUGHS) (CHUCKLES) Ooh, I hate this stuff, but I'm gonna drink it. (BOTH LAUGH) Bottoms up, as they say. (LAUGHS) Oh my God. Smooth, huh? I love you. That's really awful. (LAUGHS) Pour! Pour! Pour some more! - Oh, Jesus. - One for me, - How do you do that? - though. Okay, one for you. (LAUGHS) One for you, one for me. - Let's see, hmm. - Ooh! (LAUGHS) Yeah, we better slow down. (LAUGHS) Seriously, we better slow down. Okay, just one more shot. (LAUGHS) And then we'll slow down. Then we'll slow down. (LAUGHS) Yeah, I'll pour one for me and then one for you. (BOTH LAUGH) Oh, boy. It's a little better this time. (LAUGHS) A little smoother each time, right? Mm-hmm. Oh, that cinnamon goes down so well. Here's one for you. (LAUGHS) 'Cause the alternative is tea. - Oh, right. - Yeah, here.

I think I got 'em. Oh. (CHUCKLES) Ah, so, um, you staying around here? A tent or a lake house? - Oh. - Just come for the nature? (LAUGHS) Actually, I'm here with my daughter. We're just here for a week. We're only here for another couple days, actually. It's been a great week. Except for the rain but it's Oregon, you know. Yeah, mm-hmm. (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry, I'm Sophie. Sophie Palmer. - Oh, Carla. - Oh. (CHUCKLES) I'm here with my brother Matt. - Oh, that's good. - He should be around here, actually, somewhere. He just went for more water. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, you can never have enough. - Yeah. - After one day, we ran out. SOPHIE: Yeah. - Hey, Carla. - Yeah. Look at that. (SOPHIE LAUGHS) Hi, Matt. Right on cue. Hey Carla, you coming? Or are you walking? Do you need a ride? Oh, (CHUCKLES) okay. Yeah, thanks. (BIRDS CHIRP) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hi there, I'm Matt. Matt, this is our new friend, Sophie. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Where to, Miss Sophie? Oh, um, I am just over there. Once you start driving, when we get to the path, I'll just start walking. I'll tell you when. I'm with my daughter. You don't say? With your daughter. Oh, oh my God, Matt. You are such a pig. You'll have to excuse my brother. He was raised with wolves. So, are you staying in that first lake house over there? Oh yeah. How did you know? Oh, um, well, I saw you heading out this morning when I was on my walk. It's beautiful. Mm, thank you. Um, if you don't mind me asking, what happened a few nights ago? I don't now. What do you mean? Well, Matt and I were asleep that night. Our tent isn't too far from here. And we heard this horrible cry. Well yeah, we thought it was like a wolf or something. - Mm. - We were afraid and we started walking towards- - You were afraid. For the record, I was not afraid. We were afraid, and we started walking towards it with our flashlights. Yeah, in a classic white person move from a horror film. "Hey, it's sound dangerous. It's dark and we're alone. Let's go check it out." (CHUCKLES) We wanted to see if we could help. Someone was clearly in distress. Um, but I was afraid it was a bunch of crack heads or something. I feel bad knowing it was you guys. So, um... What happened? Are you sure it was the right place? CARLA: Oh, positive. No, nothing happened. I was with my daughter and we were drinking, but there was no loud music. Everything was pretty low key, actually. No, it was the one 'cause there was this guy and he was loud. No, you have to be wrong. Mm. I mean, everything was fine. My daughter can be loud but she doesn't sound like a man. Neither do I. Anyhow, maybe we'll stop by for a BBQ with you and your daughter. Yeah, you're leaving when again, in two nights? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Sophie? Shall we go? You know what, I think I'm just gonna walk. I'm sorry, thank you so much, though. Hey, I'll tell you what. We'll stop by later and check with you on that BBQ, if that sounds good? Oh yeah, oh yeah, that'd be great. Roselee loves to party. And I'm sure she'd really like the company. - Thank so much you guys. - Yeah, she will. Okay well, bye. - Bye. - Bye, bye. (DOOR CLOSES) We are on our way. Yes. (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRP) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRP) (DOOR KNOB CLATTERS) Oh no. Lee! Oh, why did you lock the door? Oh, why would you lock the door? Like we're out in the middle of nowhere. Nothing's gonna happen. Lee! - Boo! - (GASPS) Oh. (LAUGHS) Oh, my God! How many times do I have to tell you not to sneak up on me? At least one more time, Miss Palmer. (SIGHS) Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yes, can you please open the door? I left it opened and unlocked so you could get back in. Oh, do not tell me that. I do not have the keys. You have to have them. No, Mom, you do. The wind must have blown the door closed. No! Oh, that means the keys are in there. - I don't know. - What are we gonna do? I don't know what to tell you, Mom. Oh, man. Oh, okay. Let me, let me just think a minute. Uh, oh my gosh. I got it. - What? - Just wait. Where are you going? (INTENSE MUSIC) (GUN FIRES) Oh! - Ha, ha! - Oh, God. Tada! You worry way too much. The window was open. Wait, what's wrong? Nothing. Did you take your pills today? Yes! I took my fucking pills! Jesus! Okay, jeez, Mom. Gosh. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just met these people on the way back. Oh, well that's good, right? You made friends and... I want you to be straight with me, okay? Did anything happen when I was away yesterday? Like, did anything strange like loud noises or... But you were here, Mom. Yeah, but when I was away. Well, when you were in town, nothing happened. No screaming or orgies, nothing. Why? What did they say? Never mind. Oh. (CHUCKLES) I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew it. It's okay. It's okay. You know what, I gonna go have a nap. - Okay? - Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I'm gonna go back to the lake then and let you relax. - Okay. - I love you, Mom.

Sheriff Roy Keeps. Tad County Sheriff's Office. This is Park Ranger, Jennifer Ross. Ma'am. ROY: And your name? (CROWS CAW) (BIRDS CHIRP) And your name? I'm Sophie Palmer. Is everything okay? That's why we're here, Miss Palmer. You rentin' from the Grangers? Yeah, Tom and Amy are friends of me and my daughter's. Did something happen? Did you happen to hear a disturbance last Thursday about 10:00 pm? Maybe you were having a party. A party, a party. Look, listen, my daughter and I, we're eating and sleeping and sunbathing, and it's all very low key. Leave your daughter by herself at any time? I went to the store, but if anything happened, she would have told me. Sorry, Miss Palmer, we received a call concerning noise after hours, and it's our job to come and ask questions to be sure that you and your daughter are safe. We certainly don't wanna frustrate you. We're here for your safety and for the safety of the other residents. My daughter is a very good girl. We all have secrets, Miss Palmer. Kids do things sometimes they don't wanna talk about. The type of behavior we wouldn't expect. Mean, aggressive. Even violence. It only takes one time to cross that line. Would it be okay if we came by and spoke to your daughter later? Of course Of course, that would be fine. Your daughter's name? (INTENSE MUSIC) Your daughters name? ROY: Miss Palmer? It's Roselee. Thank you. Oh, of course. Miss Palmer, are you okay? Is everything okay? It's fine. It's just these migraines. Everything is fine. We'll be back later. You have a good day, ma'am. (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) Did Sophie seem weird to you? What do you mean? Seriously? I just don't want any trouble. You mean again? Listen, sis is only gonna be able to get you out of bind so many times. That's a street that goes both ways. Or did you forget that? Hey, remember the first time we went camping? How could I forget? It was a good time, no? It was the best time. I think the mom would be down for it. I'm into some weird shit but I get this stay the fuck away vibe, sis. We should drop by and see how drunk she gets. Maybe the daughter won't even show up. And if she does, you can have the daughter, and I can have Sophie. Hmm, and if she doesn't, well, I'm sure the three of us can have a little bit of fun, hmm? Listen, we always have each other. We sure do. Always and forever. (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) Gin. (SCOFFS) You always win. Not always. Most of the time, but not always. (BOTH LAUGH) Uh. I'm gonna go get out of these stinky clothes. I smell like guano and old cheeseburgers. Yeah. (LAUGHS) Can you turn the shower on for me? Oh, sure. Just a minute. (FOOTSTEPS TAP) It's on, baby. Thanks. I'm gonna go get this funk off. (SIGHS) Oh, you forgot your towel, baby. (WATER SPRAYS) Here you go, sweetie. Fuck! Oh, thanks, Mom. You're welcome. Mom? Yeah. You know, I know you did your best to protect me from Dale and from Dad. (SIGHS) And I know it wasn't easy for you, either. I just wanted you to know that. You're welcome, baby. They deserve what they got, boy. (SCOFFS) Nobody hurts my baby. I know, Mom. You know, I should have done more. Part of me didn't wanna believe that what was going on was going on. I should have been stronger. But that other part of me, I never wanna see that part of me again. (SIGHS) (CRICKETS CHIRP) Now I can count on you, right? What? Not to pull a stunt like you did earlier. Not to bring this woman to tears by giving her the fifth degree. I'm not gonna make any promises, Ross. I gotta trust me gut. Your gut? Like that time you trusted your gut with that 12 year old? Hey, he looked shifty. What do you want me to say, I'm sorry? Okay, I'm sorry. (SIGHS) I would like to just have an exchange without somebody shitting themselves. I thought I was the hard ass. Hard-headed, maybe. I hate this place. It gives me the creeps. I just wanna get in and take care of business and get the hell out. What is it about this place that makes you so spooky, Ross? I'll tell ya sometime. Just not now. Hey, I think you need to tell me before we go in. It isn't a short story and it isn't a story I like to tell. Now remember, smile. I am smiling. Seriously. (KNOCKING) ROY: Palmer. (CRICKETS CHIRP) (SCOFFS) (CRICKETS CHIRP) (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) - Have a seat. - Uh-huh. Would you like a coffee? - No. - I would like... Sure, I would love a cup of coffee. No, ma'am. No, thank you. Okay. Miss Palmer, you have anything to tell us? Did you get a chance to speak to your daughter, Roselee? What do you mean? Did you get a chance to talk to your daughter? Oh. (CHUCKLES) God, no. Oh, oh, yes. She says she does not remember anything strange. Nothing at all? No. Would you mind if we ask her a few questions ourselves? Oh, no. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Ah, she's, ah... Oh, she's in the shower. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (DISTORTED VOICE) Maybe we should come back. I'll say. Oh. Miss Palmer, are you on any prescription medications? (SIGHS) Hey, are you okay? Oh yes, I'm, I'm, I'm... Um, no. I mean, yes. I'm, I'm fine. I'm okay. (SIGHS) That girl must love her shower. How much longer do you think it'll be? Oh, oh, not very long. But you said she didn't recall anything, right? Right, right. She, she doesn't remember anything. What, what do you want? Miss Palmer, there's no reason to be upset. I am not upset! Miss Palmer. (SOPHIE GASPS) - Don't hurt us! - Miss Palmer, it's okay. (GASPS) We didn't mean to. (SOPHIE GASPS) It's okay, Miss Palmer. (GASPS) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it's just my, my husband. He... Oh, I'm so sorry. JENNY: It's okay. I'm gonna talk to Lee. - Okay. - No, Miss Palmer. We'll be going. We will be going. We'll show ourselves out. Thanks again for your time. We'll stop by again tomorrow. (CRICKETS CHIRP) Something's just not right. I smell it. Jesus, Roy, will you just let it go? It's bad enough we're dredging up abusive nightmares for that poor woman, and you're putting the screws to her too. Something's going on here, Ross. (SIGHS) You're not in Dallas anymore. This is Century Lakes. It's just simple folk with simple lives. Maybe you're right. I can't shake it. This place. What you won't tell me about this place. It's... I feel it. It's a darkness, a chill. I felt this one time before. I ignored it, people paid the price. What are you talking about? (SIGHS) It happened in Dallas. There as a call. A neighbor said he heard screams next door. I rolled out on it. When I got there, I went up to the door. Everything was quiet. It was too quiet. I knocked. A pretty little thing came to the door. Late 20's. Didn't have any bruises. No cuts. Big smile. I ask her, "Everything okay?" I ask her repeatedly. Over and over. I interviewed her, five or six minutes. She assured me. It was all right. I walked away. But I knew it wasn't right. I knew something was wrong. I had that feeling. Same feeling I got here. (CRICKETS CHIRP) What happened? Second call came in later that night. I was already off duty. I didn't take it. But when it came across the scanner as the same place, I knew it was gonna be bad. And it was. What happened? Girl's boyfriend, he was a meth head. He was high. He took a hammer and he beat her four year old son to death. Coroner said the boy didn't die right away. Said he probably lived an hour, maybe two. Second call that came in that night, that was the girl screaming. Boyfriend took the same hammer, crushed her skull. I didn't do nothing. I walked away. Ross, you might think I'm an asshole, but I can't get that picture of that little boy and his mama out of my mind. I'm sorry, Roy, but this is not that situation. It just isn't. I wish I had your confidence. I really do. People are dark. Everyone has a secret. Everyone, Ross. (SIGHS) I'm sorry, Roy. I'm really sorry that you had to go through that. I've seen a lot of things. Some worse that that. Your cup fills up quick. You either gotta empty your cup or get a new one. Well, to get a fresh start, you need to let go of your past. Hmm. You're a good woman, Ross. It's getting late. Let's get outta here.

(GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) (TRAFFIC WHIRS) (BIRDS CHIRP) (SIGHS) This is Sheriff Keeps. Ross? Everything okay? Lunch. You wanna have lunch with me? Yeah, sure. No, I'm on the west side of the lake up on Ridge Road. I can be there in 20 minutes. Okay, see ya at the park. (CHUCKLES) I'll be damned. (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) (WINCES) Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, look at you. (WINCES) Jeez, did you go through some poison ivy or something? (BOTH LAUGH) Aw, I don't know. Maybe we should get into town. I could ask that Matt guy to drive us, and we could get some help and I could get my keys redone. Yeah, but how's your head, better? Hmm. It's okay. It's been days now and I don't why you don't drink anymore. (WINCES) Look, I'm sorry. I know, I have not been myself lately. (SIGHS) It's just, I can't help with this headache. And, ow, you know what? Now I just, I can't find my keys. I can't sleep at night. Look, look, look at this. Look at this. (WINCES) Okay. I know that you're worried if we wait until Saturday. Um, you said your friends were gonna be back later. Why don't we just wait for them, and then we can leave when they get back. Unless they don't come. (WINCES) You know what? We could, we could just pack up and leave. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. (WINCES) Do you remember this lullaby? (CHUCKLES) ♪ Rock a bye baby ♪ ♪ On the tree top ♪ (WINCES) ♪ When the wind blows ♪ ♪ The cradle will rock ♪ (WINCES) ♪ When the bow breaks ♪ ♪ The cradle will fall ♪ ♪ And down will come baby ♪ ♪ Cradle and all ♪ (CHUCKLES) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) Hey, come. Have a seat. (BIRDS CHIRP) Don't mind if I do. This is quite unexpected. Well, we only see each other regarding work, so I thought why not actually have a social visit while we can get to know each other a little better? That's very kind of you. Turkey or turkey? (CHUCKLES) I think I'll have turkey. Turkey it is. You had it planned, that I would take turkey. That's a damn good sandwich. Did you make this? Yes, I did. They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. So, why a park ranger in Oregon? Well there are only two states that don't require you to have a gun to be a ranger, and Oregon is one of them. And I hate guns. I love the trees and I grew up here. Why Oregon for you? Hmm, well in I grew up in East Texas. Trees, lakes, a place much like this. Hunting, fishing, and guns. After the incident in Dallas, I needed a change. Tad County needed a sheriff. You know, guns are a requirement for sheriffs. Maybe I should take you shooting some time. (CHUCKLES) No, that's okay. Lunch and conversation is just fine. Fair enough. Listen, what happened in that house? I know you may not wanna talk about it. I understand. No, it's okay. It was a long time ago but there was a family that lived there. And the man, Jim Talent, he was disturbed. He was mentally ill and back then, people just thought he was mean-spirited. He lived there with his wife and they were having an argument and he shot her. A kid was passing by on a bike and heard the shot and walked in on Jim. (SIGHS) The wife was dead on the couch, covered in blood, and Jim was holding a pistol in his hand. Jim was out of his mind, and he kept yelling at the kid to shoot him. He put the gun in the kid's hand and he was saying, "Shoot me!" He kept saying, "End it, end it!" "Shoot me!" The kid, the kid didn't know what to do so she dropped the gun, she ran out and she thought, "I should have, I should have taken the gun. I should have grabbed the gun and run out with it so he couldn't hurt himself." And then a gun shot. Jim shot himself. (SIGHS) (BIRD CHIRP) (WAVES LAPPING) That's why you don't like guns. Do you still ride bikes? That's why I don't like guns. I never told that to anyone before. Thank you. (WAVES LAPPING) Did anyone ever tell you you're easy to talk to? Just criminals. (BOTH CHUCKLE) (DRAMATIC PIANO MUSIC) (BAG BANGS) (GROANS) Here, stay here. Stay here. (GROANS) What is it? (GROANS) I am gonna go upstairs and find out what is behind that door! I'm gonna have to break it down if I have to! No, maybe there's a reason we're not supposed to be in there. An animal or a water heater or something. Lee, don't you wanna get in there? Don't you wanna see what's in there? I have to go up there! I'm sorry. (SOBS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (INTENSE MUSIC) (KNOCKS ON DOOR) (WHIMPERS) (BIRDS CHIRP) Oh thank you! Oh, thank you for coming!

Yeah, we heard these screams a few nights ago here, and now we're hearing them in this upstairs, the same place. Yeah, there's no doubt you need help, but you know what, right now, you need just stay the fuck away from us! (GASPS) What? But... Okay, okay, okay, something strange, something strange is going on. It's true, it's true, it's true. I don't know what it is. My daughter is gone! Gone! Gone! Do you understand? She's not here! And she needs help. You satisfied? Can we get the fuck outta here now? Wait, don't... (GASPS) Lee! (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) Why do you hate me, Mom? I don't hate you, baby. Why, why would you say that? You let Dale take me. You could have stopped him.
