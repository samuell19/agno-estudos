Captioning made possible by mgm home entertainment He's cold. We'll be home in a couple of minutes. His teeth are chattering. You gonna make friends with this one, too? He is cold. Come here. He's relaxing. He likes me. Me, too. Frank? Patrick. Aw, jan, you know how much this means to me. Get with it, will you, baby? Frank! Hey, frank! Oh. No. Oh, frank. Come on. Ok, colonel. Ok. Lay off. Stop it. Ready for duty. Always ready. Yes, sir, colonel. Jan, put on some coffee. Don't I always put a pot of coffee on the stove before I pass out? There's lots of coffee. Oh, my dear dr. Schratt, you sober up with more grace than anybody I ever saw. You're terrific. Come on, let's go. Are you kiddin'? Look. Nope. Frank, don't let me down. What's more useless than a surgeon with a hangover? I'm a drunken zero. I pass. No, you don't. I'd rather have you do a corneal transplant for me drunk than anybody else sober. Let's go, boy. You're brilliant, but not normal. Heh heh. So are you, but are you, and who is? Uhh. Great. Come on, boy. Hit the showers. Turn in your suit. Get me a long carotid this time, will you? Yes, indeed. Clean to the last teeny pore. Darling, junior's falling asleep. Good. Look, he's the first who's not scared. That's a break for us. Less problem with clots. Pat, couldn't I keep him as a pet? I thought I was your pet. Set him on the table, honey. He's so young, so trusting. He trusts me. Must be just a baby. Pat... the others were too old. Maybe that's why we failed. This is your fifth try. It seems so pointless. 4 wasted lives. Monkey lives, and is it pointless for animals to help save human life? One soldier, one mother in an auto accident, one half-drowned boy, one baby girl feverish with freckles and a dimple. You're right, darling. I'm being silly. Thanks, dear. Now go make us one of those wonderful stews, will you? She is really something. So are you, pal. Ok, you're on. This is the day. I feel it. Me, too. In about 30 minutes, we'll have a monkey brain... alive. Well, yes or no? Frank, the pump. Now the motor. Jan, check the oscillograph. For the fifth and last time, I hope, nothing. Keep watching it. Frank, up 5 microvolts. An alpha curve. Faint, but it's here. Up 5 more. The curve's firm and normal. Honey, take a look. It's something, kids. A brain without a body... alive. It's wonderful. Great work, frank. Congratulations. Terrific, but I'm glad it's over. All set, darling. Immediately upon removal, 2 electrodes fastened to cortical tissue. If that's for me, I'm not here. Hello? No, dr. Schratt's not here. Well, I don't know about dr. Cory. Oh, hold on a minute. Pat, it's the chief ranger. There's been an airplane accident. He thinks some of the passengers may still be alive. Why don't they get frank? He'll be in town in a half an hour. That half hour might save a human life. This is cory. I'll be glad to help. Where do I meet you? I'll be there as quickly as possible. Honey, take care of things. Notes of everything, huh? I'll watch every second. Yeah. Ok, boys. Set him down. He'll never make it to the hospital. What about your place, doc? It's only a couple of miles. I don't think he has a chance, but it's worth a try. Ok. This way, fellas. Still living? Perfect. Same as when you left. What about the wreck? Three dead, one survivor. He's in bad shape. Give me a hand with this, boys. Put the head right over here. Jan, give them scissors. Easy now, fellas. Fast as you can, cut away the clothes. Tuttle, help with the sheet there. You'll find 'em in the side drawer. Better get frank. He's running a temperature. I think he's asleep. Wake him up. Get him. You pull him through, doc, you should be set for life. How do you mean? That's warren h. Donovan. Means nothing to me. He's supposed to be worth a hundred million. The sky's the limit on your fee. Money can't help him now. All right, boys. Thanks very much. That's swell. You can go. Frank'll be here in a minute. Honey, we'll need your help. Will you get the gowns and things? Hurry up, frank. Why weren't you in your office? The whole wide world is my office. How bad is he? Both legs completely gone. His chest is crushed. Tuttle, you better get into the hospital. If we pull him through, we'll need a lot of things. Right. I'll call you as soon as I get to town. We'll know for sure by then. We'll need adrenaline, and I'd start plasma right now. Frank, you take care of the chest. I'll do the legs. Clamp. Uh... what's the pulse? None. I think he's gone. Adrenaline. Let frank do it. Right into the heart. Not a flicker. Try a massage. Still nothing. Any idea who the poor man was? Some millionaire, name of donovan, tuttle said. Absolutely nothing. Hmm. Any ideas? I wouldn't have wasted this much time. All right, that's that. Thanks for covering for me, pat. Tuttle hates my guts. He'd love to see his brother in my job. Well, you go on back to bed. I'll tell him you were sick. Make out the death certificate first, though. That's not my department. Why don't I park mr. Donovan in the garage? All right. Thanks. Wait a minute. Hold everything. Watch the current, will you, frank? Jan, give us readings. What's the big idea? I'm curious, that's all. What about it, jan? There must be something wrong. There are indications of alpha waves. Not too unusual. In violent death, like the plane crash, organs of the body die at different times, and his brain's still alive. You're right. The waves aren't weakening at all. Come on, frank, I think we have time enough. Time for what? Donovan's dead, isn't he? Beyond all help? So? Science can use donovan's brain. Hurry, or we'll never make it. You're crazy. Count me out. It's against the law to operate on a corpse. It could mean jail. And for what? What do you hope to prove? There's no time to talk now. Either help me, or leave me on my own. Please, darling, don't... Believe in me, will you, baby? Get the instruments out of the sterilizer. Quickly. The bottom tray. You're wackier sober than I ever was crocked. What an idea, stealing a man's brain. Second success of the day. To patrick cory, doctor of science, who plays miracle man on the side. Now will you tell us why? Jan, please, 40th minute... Tissue regains color, complete recovery from surgical shock. It's simple, frank. We have blood banks, bone banks, eye banks, corneal transplants from dead to living. Jan, arteries resuming pre-operative state. Add the time. So what? Preservation of tissue is nothing new. Why risk a jail sentence for that? If this brain lives, maybe we can discover how it thinks. Impossible. It can't see, it can't hear, and it can't feel. That's correct. The brain itself can't. That's why this one feels no pain even though it's still alive, but this brain contains all the knowledge and experience of warren donovan's entire life. In other words, all his thoughts. The impulses of these thoughts, then, must still be alive. You're just guessing, aren't you? Am I? What do you think is registering on the oscillograph? I'm a doctor, not an electrician. For all I know, that thing would move even without the brain. Let's see. Fluid level has dropped 2 millimeters. Do you suppose it could be absorbing nourishment? Promise me something, will you, pal? If anyone ever asks any questions about this, you don't even know my name. I promise. Well, see ya. Where are you going? Still 11 bottles left in that case. Why don't you take them home with you? Good idea. I'm supposed to be home... on duty. Darling, what about the stew? Oh, right now, but in here, please. I'm not budging an inch as long as mr. Donovan's brain is still alive. 72nd hour, third day. Current increase... 2 microvolts. Please, take it off the hook. Well, let's face it, darling. If you don't go to town, higgins is going to come out here. Do you want that? I told you I'd see him, honey, but not now. Please, don't stop. If that's higgins, keep him in the living room. I'll come out. All right, but I'm worried. Frank said there was talk of an autopsy. How are you going to explain the stitches in his head? I'll explain 'em. Here are your chemicals. Now will you forget that thing and come on back to town with me? Are they performing an autopsy? No autopsy yet. It's just that this donovan was a very important man. The c.a.a. is investigating the crash, but the main thing is higgins and webster are after my neck. Now will you come on back with me and get me off the spot? Ok, pal, anything you say. Just give me a few minutes to shave. Take over, will you, dear? Darling... wear a tie, huh? If anyone thinks I was guilty of negligence, why not perform an autopsy? We considered that, but mr. Donovan's family decided it wasn't necessary. Ah, tuttle. Tuttle, didn't you tell them we did everything we could? There's no dispute about that. Then why am I here? Principally, with regard to dr. Schratt. Now would you say... Would you say dr. Schratt was or was not in condition to perform his duties? Dr. schratt was in perfect condition to perform his duties, and he did. When I tried to reach him, he wasn't at his office. At dr. Cory's, he smelled like a barroom, and mike at the liquor store says he bought a case of that russian stuff he lives on. Caviar? Tuttle, you're a fine ranger. Why don't you mind your own business? Mr. webster, take my word for it. You couldn't have a more capable person in your employ than dr. Schratt. Anything else, gentlemen? Nothing more for me. Mr. donovan's son and daughter are waiting to meet you. Of course. I'll buy you a drink sometime, ranger. What's your version, doc? Did you know donovan before? I asked you men to cooperate. I'll be back in a minute, fellas. Please, get me on the way out. Thanks a lot. Ok, doc. Mrs. parton, mr. Donovan, dr. Cory. Hello, doctor. How do you do, dr. Cory? I'm very sorry about your father. Well, thank you, doctor. My sister and I have been assured everything possible was done. Believe me, it was. Did dad say anything before he died? No. He was unconscious when we got to the wreck, and he stayed that way. I'd say he passed on very peacefully. No pain. We wondered if any papers fell out of his pockets. Not that I know of. Are you certain? You notice anything? No. As I told you before, dr. Cory and I were concerned only with what we had to do. We understand. We're grateful to you both. If there's ever anything we can do to show our appreciation, please call on us anytime. By all means, do. Thank you, I will. Good luck to you both. Fellas, I can't add a thing to what you already know. What about the rumor that tuttle's brother will replace dr. Schratt? Quote, nobody could be better in his job than dr. Frank schratt, unquote. That's all, boys. Will you excuse me now? Sure, doctor. So far, so good. Hiya, doc. My name's yocum, herbie yocum. I freelance for a livin' with my little brownie here. Came up on my own on spec to do a picture story on donovan's death. Well, where do I fit in? He died at your house, didn't he? Look, doc, I'd like to get a shot of the operating table where he kicked off. That's a little gruesome, isn't it? Delicious. The sunday supplement's eat this stuff up. I got some shots of donovan in the morgue. What happened to his head? It was a plane crash, remember? He had extensive injuries. Oh, come on, doc. Give me a break. If you do, I'll take some shots of your kids. All right, yocum. Do you want to follow me in your car? Are you kiddin'? The finance company took it 4 payments back. Doc, you're my chauffeur. I just added 5 ccs of serum, and there was a small deviation... We'll talk about it later. Hey, good lookin' lab you got here, doc. Oh, a heart, huh? Hey, a brain. All right, yocum. This is where donovan died. Take your picture from over there. Yeah, sure, doc. And include us out. Got it? One more, just in case. Hey, how about doin' a story on your stuff, doc? You know, it might be worth a couple of hundred dollars, and I'll split with you. No, thanks. Uh... what do you think you're doing? Oh, doc, you're rushing me. That one slipped. You know, I just lost 6 cents. That's what these bulbs cost me wholesale. This one ought to do it. All right. Take him back to town, will you, please, frank? Well, thanks, doc, and if you're ever in hollywood and need a favor, look me up. Yocum. Y-o-c-u-m. The only one in the phone book. Bye. How did you ever happen to allow a thing like that? He wanted some pictures of where donovan died. He'd already taken pictures in the morgue, and I was afraid he'd get suspicious if didn't let him come here. What were you saying now when we came in about a deviation? Well, it was at 4:40. I was checking the voltage. Here comes another one. This like the 4:40 one? Yes. Huh. 2 identical deviations. Looks like a beta frequency. Oh, it is. The brain must be thinking systematically. Darling, you watch the screen. I want to try something. It's another deviation, a bigger one. Jan... I feel we are about to stumble onto something very important. For instance? Well, I don't know for sure, but we know the brain reacts and reacts differently. The next step is to find out what these reactions mean. Specifically, which cells are responsible for thoughts, emotions, actions. All right, but where do we go from there? now you're asking me too much too soon. These answers may take years. By the way, how's your patience? What do you think? I think someday you'll be as famous as madame eve curie. Well, if I'm as useful to you as she was to her husband, I'll settle for that. You're just as useful... and lot's prettier. Oh, pat, please go take a nap. Not now, dear. You do the sleeping for both of us. Let me have the notes, please. Seventh day. Brain's absorption of nourishment increasing approximately 1 cc per hour. Growth and pulsations visible to naked eye. These impulses! They must mean something. They must! More notes? No, not now, dear. Pat, I'm worried about frank. Why? He'll show up when he runs out of money. Don't you feel a little guilty? If he hadn't been here helping you, he'd have been home on duty when tuttle called. Wouldn't have lost his job. Jan, when a teetotaler takes after a drunk, the drunk doesn't have a chance. Tuttle's been after frank for a year now. Sometimes I think you're a bad influence. Why don't you discourage frank from drinking? Oh, perhaps I'll cure frank and every other alcoholic, if I can solve the mystery of donovan's brain. I think it's a matter of chemistry, how the brain thinks. The problem is to find out what chemical combinations are responsible for success, failure, happiness, misery. Sounds impossible. But it isn't. It can't be. There has to be a way. Pat, I wish you'd eat and get a good night's sleep. Oh, there must be some way. Now this oscillograph has shown us all kinds of reactions, but what do they mean? Honey, are you really interested in reactions? Are you kidding? Of course. Well, what about mine? It looks like we're going to spend the rest of our lives here in this room. All right. I don't miss the fresh air, and my cooking smells like carbolic acid, but there's no place in here for you to warm my cold feet on these long winter nights. I guess if we had about a hundred mirrors, we could watch the brain from every room in the house, couldn't we? If you think it'll work, I'll buy them. Something else will work. What? We'll give the brain a voice, and we can hear it from anywhere. Now who's kidding who? No, no, no. Honest. I'll show you. Look, go get the portable radio, will you? And the soldering iron. And a ham sandwich on rye! See, beautiful? The same electrical impulses which move the oscillograph can be turned into sound waves. This thing lets us see the brain think, and the amplifier and loud speaker let us hear. If I only knew what it was thinking. It sounds spooky. Now when did we get superstitious? I'm not really. I'm just a little upset. What about? Well, now that that thing works, can we go in the other room, sit in front of the fire? Sure, dear. That's what it's for. Welcome home, dr. Schratt. Well, it's about time you showed up. Can I live in your breakfast nook? It's been made up for days. How's the mastermind doing with his stolen brain? Go take a shower, will you? What's that noise? Mr. donovan thinking out loud. Oh, very funny. You look like you could use a shower and a shave and some sleep. Thank you, frank. Pat's letting himself run down like a broken clock. He won't listen to me. Look, pal, I've got an idea... The answer to everything you want to know. You come along fishing with me for 3 days, and I'll solve all your problems for you. All right, wise guy, let's have it now. What you need is a nice big crystal ball. Oh. If you didn't have a beard, I'd kiss you for that. For what? Crystal ball, that's it! The next step... Clairvoyance, telepathy. You remember the experiments at duke university. One brain transmitting thoughts, the other receiving them. Well, don't you get it? Donovan's brain is sending out thoughts. All I have to do is use my brain to receive them. Oh, naturally. Very simple. Darling, will you do something for me? Will you go into town and get back issues of magazines and newspapers? I want every article that has anything to do with donovan. Every possible detail of his life. Will you, baby, please? Hey, you sober enough? Will you drive her? I'm beat. I want to take that shower you sold me on and sleep. I'm tired of this space-patrol junk. All right, all right. Darling, will you, please? Sure. Maybe there's something in the last issue of newsweek. "Despite his millions, "donovan was notoriously antagonistic toward organized charity. His huge... " Hey, you read that one before. Oh. How about this? "The government case against donovan "for income tax evasion "has been in a legal snarl for years. "Donovan carried to an extreme "the independence of the self-made man. "What belonged to him he felt was his and his alone. "He scorned taxes, fought the payment of every penny. "Treasury department experts refused comment "on how the fact that donovan left no will will affect the status of their case." Jan, read that one again that gives his description. "Donovan's strength was in his lined, "granite-like face and piercing eyes. "Nephritis had left him in poor physical state. "He must have been in constant pain, "because he generally walked with a limp, his right hand soothing his aching kidney." Yeah, a lot of walking he did with 4 cadillacs. I can just see him now, hobbling from the mansion to his car, chewing on a $2 cigar and blowing smoke rings worth a nickel a piece. Well, thanks for everything, kids. Night, darling. Frank. I'm gonna catch us some nice fresh trout for breakfast. Want to come along? No, thanks. Somebody around here ought to get some sleep. See you in the morning. Hey, if you happen to get a message from an old lady with white hair, that's my great aunt marta. Say I'm out. Hey! Anybody up? Look. 3 nights in a row he hasn't been to bed. She should have married a mattress tester. Pat. Hmm? Pat? Now, this is silly. Why didn't you come to bed? What happened? A remarkable occurrence, dr. Cory. A thoroughly exhausted man fell asleep. Now, look. Why don't we put this on a sensible basis? Now that frank's living here, we can take turns, and that way we won't miss a thing, and we can still keep our health. You write this? No. Frank, is this one of your gags? Did you pull this after I fell asleep? No. So help me, pat. How could I? I was busy catching our breakfast. What is it, darling? Where's that picture of donovan's signature? I think it's in newsweek. Newsweek? Give us a hand, will you, frank? Here it is. We've done it. Contact with donovan's brain at last. I wonder who fuller is. Hi, flower girl. Finally remembered how bright the sunshine is. I can't seem to make contact today, so I'm going to check around and try to find out who fuller is. I wish you'd stay close by. Of course, darling. Won't miss a thing. Why aren't you in the laboratory? I told you to watch the oscillograph until I returned. Don't talk to me like that. Well, then do as I tell you. Why don't you stop fooling yourself? You're not kidding me. You don't believe that donovan and cory have arrived at a meeting of minds? Not in a million years. You're blind, schratt. Report, please. Constant glow, same as when you left. Fabulous. Look. See the difference? Now look at the oscillograph. See? The brain is falling asleep. That's good. Let's go in the living room, hmm? All right, dear. Pat, frank and I had a long talk when you were out. Oh? We decided that you're carrying this thing too far. Too far? Oh, darling, this is only the beginning. Do you remember our conversation when you came in? Conversation? Hmm. Very vaguely. And you think that's the sign of a healthy mind? Look, pat, we're both doctors. We understand autosuggestion, self-hypnosis. Darling, don't you see? The limp, the tone of voice. You're imitating donovan subconsciously, even to practicing his signature with your left hand. Oh, jan, please. We read you every detail of donovan's life, and you're so anxious to see this crazy experiment succeed... What do I have to do to convince you both this donovan business is on the level? You'll never convince me. I expect you any day to send me out for a box of $2 cigars. You told us that it was an experiment, an investigation of human emotions. It is. A search for happiness. It is all those things, but human emotions exist way deep in the mind. So far I've only managed a superficial communication with the brain. Oh, you're off your rocker, pal. You're way past the brain. You're looking for the soul. You're out of your department. That's why I tell you you're kidding yourself, and if you're not, if you are on the level, then you're trying to play god. Oh, frank. You know I couldn't have gotten this far without... god's help. That wins this round, chum, but you wait. Uh, did you measure today's increase in size? No, not yet. I better do it. I'll be back in a few minutes. He seems so sincere. The mind's a funny thing, jan. This jekyll and hyde thing, it's weird. You want me to end it? How do you mean? You tell me when, and we'll have an accident. A fuse in the garage will pop, and 5 minutes later, we'll bury donovan's brain. Much as I'd like it, I want pat to be the one to say when. Janice, pack my suitcase. And I'll want the tape recorder. Where are you going? To the city. Why? For how long? When did you... Please don't interrupt my train of thought. While I'm away, increase nourishment to the brain... Half a pint a day. Frank, order a taxi, then call the airport and charter a private plane. Yes, sir? Suite 612, if it's not occupied. 612? It's available. For how long? A week at least. Possibly longer. Dr. cory? It's nice having you with us. Incidentally, the rate on 612 is 75 a day. My friend mr. W.h. donovan said the rate would be 50. Oh. That was for mr. Donovan. Confidential, we thought. However... However, the rate will be $50. Have the boy take my bags upstairs. I'll be back later. Hi, doc. Remember me? Hey, don't tell me you forgot herbie yocum. Oh. Hello, yocum. I just telephoned your house. Thought maybe I'd run out and pay you a visit, but the missus said you were checking in here. Call me here later this afternoon, yocum. I'm late for an appointment now. Yeah, sure. You'll have to see the manager... mr. Mcnish. Mr. mcnish? Yes? I was sent to you about this. Effie. You have identification, doctor? Yes, certainly. Effie, will you get me the signature card of the roger hinds account and the ledger sheet, please. Yes, sir. Have you known mr. Hinds long, doctor? Does it matter? Well, as a matter of fact, to my knowledge, he's never been in the bank. Naturally, we're a bit curious about him. All his deposits and withdrawals have been made by mail. We all have our idiosyncrasies, mr. Mcnish. How do you wish to have this cashed, doctor? Mostly thousands, some hundreds, and a few fifties. Well, that will just about close the account. I wouldn't know about that. You have an office here in the city, doctor? No, I'm visiting at the town house. I see. Well, here you are, sir. $27,000. May I have an envelope, please? Certainly, sir. And if you'd care to open an account... No, thank you, mr. Mcnish. Good day, sir. Get me the treasury department, bureau of investigation... A mr. Brooke. Yes. Do you have this equipment on hand? Yeah, I think so. I want immediate delivery to that address. If you don't have a truck, hire one. I don't know about that. I'll pay double the usual hauling rate, with a $100 bonus for the men on the truck. How much do I owe you? I'll have to figure it out. A rough guess will be good enough. Well, I'd say, uh, with the tax... it'd be pretty close to $8,000. Your firm will absorb the tax, or I'll use my professional connections to make the purchase wholesale, understand? Have the driver give the change to mrs. Cory. $50 of that is for you. What can I do for you, sir? I was sent by w.h. donovan. Do you have any blue serge with a thin pinstripe? Yes, sir. We certainly do. We had just ordered a bolt especially for mr. Donovan shortly before... the accident. I'll take half a dozen suits. Certainly, sir. I want the first one in the morning. That's impossible, sir. Not if you put one tailor on the coat, another on the trousers, and have both work all night! Now, let's get on with my measurements. Mr. nathaniel fuller, please. Mr. fuller is in conference. He'll be tied up until after lunch. Tell him a friend of w.h. donovan wants to see him. Say it's urgent. But... Go on. Excuse me, mr. Fuller, but there's a gentleman here... A friend of mr. W.h. donovan's. Says it's urgent. Who is he? Dr. patrick cory. Dr. patrick cory. Cory? Tell him to come back some other time. Fuller, I have a message for you from warren donovan. You'll see me now. Sorry, mr. Fuller. Have mr. Cory come in. The first door. Now, mr. Cory, what is so urgent? It's dr. cory. Mr. fuller, I want you to put through a phone call to mr. Donovan's washington connection. Tell him to leave washington tonight by plane. You and he will be in my suite, 612 at the town house, at 11:00 tomorrow morning. I don't know what you're talking about, dr. Cory. Do you know who I am? Frankly, no. Mr. donovan died in my home. Oh, that's right. No wonder your name sounded slightly familiar. However, I doubt if mr. Donovan's connection, as you refer to him, would drop his official duties and come out here on my say-so. He will when you tell him that certain checks, endorsed by him, are in my possession. He still wants them, doesn't he? Now, see here, dr. Cory. Yes, mr. Fuller? Do you recognize the handwriting? Yes, but... Then follow my instructions, mr. Fuller. Aren't there certain checks with your endorsement, too? See you in the morning, mr. Fuller. Suite 612. Get me the long-distance operator. I want to make a person-to-person call to washington. Yes, sir. 612, please. Yes, sir. Room service? This is 612. Send up a thick steak, porterhouse, rare, charred, asparagus hollandaise, celery hearts, crisp, olives, large ones. That's right. No coffee. No, milk. Dr. cory? My name is brooke. Mr. smith and I are investigators assigned to the treasury department. May we come in? Yes, come in. Yeah. You gentlemen don't waste any time, do you? Sit down. You're right, doctor, and we won't waste time... Ours or yours. Where did you get the $27,000 check you cashed this morning? I see no reason to answer that question. That's a surprising attitude, doctor. Well, ordinarily I'd be glad to tell you, but it so happens the money is financing a research project of mine. The backer said he'd withdraw if his connection became known. Can you arrange for us to meet this mr. Hinds? We'll respect his confidence. Next time I see him, I'll be glad to relay your request. Well, doctor, we've been instructed to tell you a little more about this situation. Thanks. I'm not interested. Would you be interested in finding yourself on trial as an accessory to tax fraud? Prosecuted by the government of the united states? If you'll give me your card, mr. Brooke, I'll have my attorney get in touch with you. We'd appreciate that, doctor. Oh, incidentally, what's your attorney's name? It's unimportant. He'll introduce himself when he calls. Room service. Come in. Well, gentlemen. We'll run along, doctor. And please, we'd rather you keep in touch with us than for us to have to keep in touch with you. It'll be ready in a moment, sir. Hiya, doc. Really living it up, huh? What is it, yocum? Remember, doc, I told you I was broke? Well, I wrote an article, and I think it's gonna get me a lot of loot. You mean the one on mr. Donovan? Well, sort of, but I got a new slant on it, and it's a dilly. How does that concern me? Oh, I thought maybe you'd like to see it. Good title... "dead man's living brain." Is the brain still alive? Yes. Say, that's good. Some editor might want proof. I can get 10 grand for that. It's worth it. Oh, you really think it's good, huh? It's a good guess, yocum. That's all. Ah, the public don't care about that. And I got pictures. Look. Here's donovan in the morgue. I took the bandages off so you can see the stitches. Here's donovan's brain in your lab. Gee, the missis looks pretty, doesn't she? That's the one I thought was gonna cost me 6 cents. Ha ha ha. Yocum, why go off half-cocked on this thing? I mean, why not forget this article for a while, and then when the experiment's completed, I'll collaborate with you. That's swell, doc, but what do I live on in the meantime? Will you make me a small advancement? How small? Oh, say a couple of grand. What makes you think I have that kind of money? I just happened to be around the bank when you picked up a bundle. I see. Pretty sharp, aren't you? Yocum, have you ever been in trouble? Not your kind of trouble, no. You know, stealing a dead man's brain is quite a rap. A cousin of mine's a lawyer. He says it's a 5-year stretch, besides losing your medical license. How do I reach you in case I want to get in touch? Like I told you... Yocum, herbie yocum. The only one in the phone book. Oh, and keep the copies. I got plenty. And picture negatives, too. See you next week, pal. Next month. Well, that depends on how long this lasts. Happy days, doc. So long, partner. Give me the desk. This is dr. Cory in 612. Call morton flying service and charter a plane to take me to green valley. No, I'll keep the suite. I'm coming back in the morning. Hasn't it the slightest sign of decay? None. I've never seen healthier tissue. It's growing larger by the day. I wonder if he'll be himself. I doubt it. It's my guess he's losing himself. That's what worries me. Look. Hmm. I wonder what effect it's having on him. Let's go see. hello, frank. Darling. Do you control it, or does it control you? I wouldn't call it control. I'd say I make my mind receptive, submit to the brain's will. The brain takes over, that's all. You know, a strange thing happened this afternoon. I was sitting in front of the brain concentrating like you do, only, to tell the truth, I was wishing that thing would die, when suddenly my head began to swim, and I had an eerie feeling that that thing was reading my mind. That must be the equipment I ordered. Dr. cory? That's right. Aloe supply. Oh, yes. How would you like us to uncrate the stuff outside? Why mess up the house? Good idea. I'll open the back door. It's closer to the lab. Ok, doc. What kind of equipment? Where did you get the money? Oh, don't worry about that, dear. Now, let's see. There's an automatic feeder which can nourish the brain for a year, amplifiers for increasing the brain's output, a thermostatic temperature control, plus a generator and change-over gimmicks which can supply power in case something happens to the regular power supply. might as well get it installed now. I don't like it, jan. He says he submits. What happens if he can't stop submitting? Oh, but could that happen? Why not? That's why it has to stop right now. Don't talk to him about it until morning, frank. He needs a good night's sleep. It's a little late for talk, jan. Stop that! Pat! Pat! Pat! Pat! Pat! Pat! What's the matter with you? Have you lost your mind? I'm sorry, frank. Give me your word not to interfere again. I was only trying to save you from yourself, pal. Did I ever try to stop you from having a drink? This is different. It's unnatural, unholy. Well, if it is, then we'll let a higher power decide when it should end. Cigar counter. This is dr. Cory in 612. Send me some upman cigars. Box of 50 supremes. Send out and get them. Come in. Well, mr. Advisor himself. Did you have a pleasant flight, sir? Yes. Well, sit down, gentlemen. Make yourselves comfortable. I'm sure we've never met, but there's something about you... perhaps it's the suit. Would you gentlemen have some coffee? That's it. The suit... Like donovan's. But why, dr. Cory? Does it matter? Now, then, it is my understanding that in exchange for certain considerations, you and your washington connections would handle mr. Donovan's tax situation in such a way that... Donovan's dead, dr. Cory, and that seems to me... As I was saying... in such a way that the statute of limitations would ultimately cause the government's case to be thrown out. Now you may talk. Donovan's death released me from any agreement I may have had. You're mistaken. Certain checks endorsed by you ensure that agreement. Try to understand my position, dr. Cory. I felt dirty for many years. Here was my chance to, well... I went to my friend the attorney general and offered to cooperate in exchange for personal immunity. So you turned on your most powerful backer. A very touching story. Be that as it may, you will not clean your conscience at mr. Donovan's expense. Is that clear? Come in. Oh, yes, yes. Thank you, thank you. Cigar? No, thank you. Mr. fuller? Another reminder, like the suit? You put it very nicely, sir. Well? The attorney general cannot allow me to reverse my present stand. That, of course, is your problem. As I understand it, it requires a quarter of a million dollars to continue with the original plan. The money will be in your office on the date mr. Donovan said it would... As usual, in cash. I suggest, mr. Advisor, that you carry on. Is our procedure perfectly clear? Perfectly. I'm glad we understand each other. Gentlemen. Operator, this is an emergency. Get me green valley. 114, please, and hurry. What? The circuits are busy? Well, keep trying. It can't be busy forever. Still busy? Oh, janice. I've been trying to reach you, but the line is busy. Darling, I ache all over with pain, and I don't know why. I don't know how long it's been, but I can't seem to break contact with donovan. Now listen carefully. I don't know if I'll ever be myself again. Oh, if the line would only open. Well, keep trying! Now, janice, listen carefully. I've got to break away from the brain. I may have to do something desperate. I... I don't know. We have to end this thing. We'll have to take a wild chance. Now, you know the lightning rod on the roof of the house? Taxi! Turn right on wilshire. There's a gray sedan following us. $100 if you lose it. You got the wrong boy, buddy. This is my bread and butter. Hey! Oh, darling. Mrs. cory? Dr. crane. Is he out of danger? He's in no danger, mrs. Cory. The concussion was very mild. The leg was severely bruised and twisted out of joint. Just minor injuries. I doubt it if he'll be here a week. I feel so much better. Your husband's an amazing man. He's shown absolutely no sign of pain. Oh? We like to minimize the use of sedatives. I know. I used to be a nurse. The entire staff is baffled. We can't understand. I think pat does. One day, he'll explain it to you. If he can, he'll amaze me. Well, mrs. Cory, he seems to be waking up. I'll leave him to you. darling. What happened? Oh, I'm in such pain! Is this a hospital? You were in an accident. You'll be all right in a few days. Jan, this is unbelievable. It's very vague, but I think I deliberately walked into that accident. But why? I don't know. To get away from someone, I think. I needed time. Darling... I'm a little scared. Several times, I've tried to break contact with donovan. I haven't been able to. I did once, I think. I did some recording on the tape at the hotel. Let me tell frank to turn off the current. The new apparatus may be too strong. No. Have him turn it down 10 microvolts. What are you doing here? Why aren't you at home? Why, darling, I... Go on home where you belong. Go on, get out! I'll be there in a few days. All right, pat. Anything you say. Hello? Yes, I'll accept the call. Hello, jan. Frank, I don't know what to do. Even pat's worried. He doesn't seem to be able to throw off the influence of the brain. I was afraid that would happen. The brain has hardly quieted down since he left. He wants you to turn the current down 10 microvolts. Do it, will you? And do something else for me, please. I'm going to stay here in the hospital waiting room. The number of the phone is adams 3-9105. Call me whenever the brain goes to sleep. I've got to talk to pat again when he's himself. Sure. Good idea. Will do. Dr. cory, we don't understand what you're trying to do. Well, didn't mr. Fuller explain? It made no sense. Father's dead. Don't you see? Tom and I want to cooperate with the government. They're entitled to the back taxes they want. How dare you criticize my behavior? Aren't we entitled to the truth? It's a terrible thing to say, but dad was an awful man... Better off dead. His possessiveness, ugly suspicions, drove mother nearly insane. He had her committed to an institution because she tried to take her own life. It took his death for us to get mother out. So, you hated him, too? I loathed him. Most people loathed him. Get them out of here, fuller. See that neither of them gets another dime. Impossible, doctor. Not at all. I have a signed document to that effect. It'll be on your desk in the morning. Now, you parasitic ingrates, get out! Hey, doc. I read about your accident. How do you feel? All right. Gonna sue the company with the truck that hit you? I hadn't thought of it. Let me handle it. My other cousin's an m.d. he and the other cousin... You remember the one I told you about's a lawyer... They'll rig you up a great case. You came here for that? Well, not exactly, doc. I figured on another advance. How much this time? Same amount. 2 grand. It's been less than a week. I know it, doc. I was in hock up to my eyeballs, and I had to buy a car. How long does this go on? Oh, just till the article's published. Tell you what, yocum. Why don't you get your camera, drive out to the ranch, and take some more pictures of the brain. Hey, that's a swell idea, and I need some closer shots. You could leave right now. I'll phone schratt and tell him to give you a hand. Swell, I'll, uh, get the money out of your pocket. Ah, doc, you're a real pal. Well, better get on with it. See ya. Give me green valley 114. Jan? Oh, hello, pat. Good to hear your voice. Where's janice? Why isn't she there with you? We're out of groceries, pal. She's gone downtown. Now listen, frank. You know the photographer yocum? He's on his way there right now. Leave him in the lab alone, understand? 10 minutes alone. Yeah. The brain? Perfect, great. Bigger and better every day. Good work, frank. Thanks. There you are, mr. Fuller. All cash, including your fee. Phone washington. Say the money's on its way. Very well, dr. Cory. Purchase the cemetery property tomorrow, and the day after, I'll want to consult with an architect. It's of great importance... The construction of this permanent abode, or rather vault, which will perpetually house mr. Donovan's... remains. I'll do as you say, doctor, but this relationship of you to donovan is so unnatural, so illogical. Don't you think I'm entitled to the truth? The truth is always dangerous, mr. Fuller. In the donovan situation, it entails great misfortune to all who know. Believe me, your ignorance is insurance for personal safety. Mr. donovan intends to dominate the international financial scene, and a fatal accident will occur to all who happen to stand in his way. Good day, sir. A fatal accident will occur to anyone who stands in his way. Frank and janice... They stand in my way. Pat made that recording while the brain was destroying yocum. That proves the brain can only dominate one person at a time. But at the rate it's growing, do you think that'll always be so? Who knows? Honestly, jan, we shouldn't wait. Any minute now, that thing may get the power to paralyze us all. You have another plan? Mm-hmm, but I don't want to discuss it in here. Let's step outside. Why all the way out here? I don't know. I feel better outside. Jan, pat may never get away from the brain. It's up to us now. But pat wouldn't harm us. Donovan would... the minute we get in his way. But murder... I can't believe that pat... But yocum's death was no accident. Donovan engineered it. Then the same thing could happen to us. Donovan could kill us the same way he killed yocum. That's right, and it's too dangerous to wait any longer. Now, when pat gets back home, it's up to you to keep him outside here. Hold him. Make him angry... So angry the brain won't know what I'm doing. Well, what's that? I'll be in the laboratory. Oh, it's a nightmare. Do you think it'll work? It has to, jan. The brain is very powerful, but we know it can only concentrate on one thing at a time. We've proved that over and over again. Frank... what'll happen to pat? I mean, if we kill the brain... the brain is donovan. Frank... has donovan become so much a part of pat? I mean, could pat die? Who knows? This whole thing is beyond experience. It's a gamble. You don't have him now anyway. Frank. It has to be done, jan. Welcome home, darling. Well, I'm happy to be here. I've missed you, my dear. My friend yocum show up? Frank saw him. Too bad about the accident. Yes. Tuttle told us they just found him. How did you know? I must've heard it somewhere. I haven't seen you in so long, darling. I mean, couldn't we take a little walk or something? You look as though you haven't had a breath of fresh air in days. A walk? Of course. The exercise will do you good. Besides, you'll work up an appetite. Please, pat. Oh, but, janice, surely it's going to rain. And besides... all right, my dear. Let's take a walk. Smell the rain coming? How fresh the air is before a shower. You know, janice, you were always a very devoted wife. Were? But I still am. And you've been a wonderful husband. Thank you, my dear. Oh, pat, look at me. Look at me, please. What? Look at me, pat. You can be free if you have faith. Patrick. What is this idiocy, janice? All right. We can stop pretending now. You're not patrick cory. You're something evil living in his body. But whatever your plan is, you'll never get away with it. The experiment's over. You're right. It is over. From now on, warren donovan is a living fact. There's no further need for the instruments who gave him life. The services of schratt, cory, and yourself are no longer required. Then you'll be the one to go, mr. Donovan... Just as you should've gone weeks ago. No! What are you doing? No! Let go of me! Let go! Let go! Let go. Darling, are you all right? Y-yes, jan. I'm so glad. let's go inside. Frank! Surprised? You forgot, my dear, that you and frank are ordinary people with limited mental capacities. You couldn't possibly compete with a fully developed and powerful brain. Thanks to dr. Patrick cory, donovan's brain will live, thrive, and continue to grow far beyond the body of dr. Cory. It is already able to exist in anybody, anywhere at will. Knowing this, you now know too much... so look at my brain, my dear... Your last look. I promise you it will not be a painful one. Ohh! Good afternoon, mrs. Cory. Is the doctor ready? He'll be right with you, mr. Brooke. Is he feeling better? Much better, thanks. Good. Um, mr. Brooke, what do you think about... I mean... how long do you suppose he'll be gone? Well, I'm sorry. It's hard to say. It depends on whether there's an indictment. Well, they do know it was pat's plan to end this thing by hooking the lightning rod into the power supply. They know that, don't they? It's all on the tape recorder, mrs. Cory. Of course, a great deal will hinge on the decision of the medical board as to the ethics of the experiment and the validity of the results. Well, we'll get turned around. Mr. brooke has the valise, dear. Did you find the files on last year? Everything... All charts and notes. We're covered on practically every minute since we first started research... thanks to you, dear. Hurry back. I'll try. But they can't blame you... they can't. Jan, I went into this with my eyes open, but it got out of hand, and I did many foolish things... Things that made other people suffer. I'm only grateful the storm struck when it did, and that frank survived. Will he be well enough to help you testify? I hope so. Maybe if everything works out, they can use another country doctor around here. No, dear. You're a scientist and always will be. I love you very much. Let's go, pal.
