English subtitles by: TANIA BARÓN - ENRIQUE CORRALES VÍCTOR GONZÁLEZ FRAILE CAROL MONTALVO - ALBERTO PAZ - SARA RODRÍGUEZ Supervised by ENRIQUE CORRALES “When someone who is really looking for something finally finds it, it is not chance that bestows it upon him, but rather he himself. It is his own wishes and needs that drive him towards it.” Hermann Hesse - Swiss writer “There are only two truly important things in life. Sex is one and I don’t remember the other one…” Woody Allen - Director & Screenwriter FOURTH COMMANDMENT Host by Welcome all, to the night of mystery. Tonight we will talk about a relic… a diamond in the rough… a myth… that was a part of our society for a long time. It is nothing more and nothing less... than a book. "The Art of Hypnosis". Many historians have attributed the book Many historians have attributed the book to different ages... and peoples. Sumerians, Egyptians, Athenians, Franks, Huns, Others, and Spartans. This… is nothing but… total bullshit. Its true author was an Ukrainian migrant. From a forgotten hamlet. In 1882 he settled in Switzerland. Where he would study the secrets… of the human mind. However, it would not be until his long stay in France… when he wrote one of the basic foundations to understand the developmentthat he would write one of the key foundations for the development of history. As in, capital H history. “At long last I’ve finished my work!” “I need proof of my work’s power…” "MARTINE!" “Yes, M’lord?” “From now on…” “... your mind will become…” “...that of a rabbit!” “They’re gonna shit bricks!” It wouldn’t be until 1891 that he managed to publish his book in London. Under the pseudonym of Donald Dennis Donald Dennis Hall. At the age of 33, the young author disappeared without a trace. Quite unlike his book. Which ended up going through some of the most influential hands in 20th century history: William Randolph Hearst, Al Capone, and even… Walt Disney. In the late 1930s, the book was taken from the hands of a famous archaeologist. It ended up in the power of Joseph Goebbels. This meant that… during World War II… the book had the worst owner imaginable. The Fuhrer! After Hitler’s death in 1945, the book was returned to the Allies. Throughout the 1950s, it was a object of secret study. We have obtained previously unseen footage, unknown to human eyes for nearly 60 years… This is recording? (Cameraman) Yeah! This is the experiment… ACTIVATE AUDIO TRACK: D.D.H. 51, Take 1. The subject’s ready for the experiment we’re about to perform… from “The Art of Hypnosis” by Donald Dennis Hall. The subject is in a trance at the moment… - Hans? - Ja? Is everything in order? (Dr. Hans) Ja, ja. (Dr. Wilkinson) Where did you get the subject? Is memento from Poland. (Dr. Robertson) Excuse me… Mr. Wilkinson? (Dr. Wilkinson) Robertson? I’ve taken the liberty of reading some fragments of the book… it mentions that the author used to run his experiments on women. (Dr. Robertson) Couldn’t it be…? Robertson. Have you seen any women at all, in the last three years, in Area 51? Truth be told… no. Right. Well then, shall we go on? Ah well, let’s… commence the experiment. Hmmm… all clear. Good. OK, Robertson! The book! Ah… yes, here, sorry. (Dr. Wilkinson) Goddamn interns. Anyway. Let’s see… Everything ready, Jimmy? - Yep! - Right. From this moment onwards, you shall only heed and obey my orders! Your mind has changed! Now you are…! Rat! Professor, a giant rat! It’s eating all of the supplies, I’m thinking it’s carnivorous actually! What’s going on, what- what!? Shoo! Away from me, vermin! Let’s get the hell out of here! - (Dr. Wilkinson) No! - (Dr. Robertson) Don’t leave me in this place! I think we’re going to need... more rat poison. During the 1960s and 70s, the book vanished. But… we think we can get the picture of how that went. Peace and love, man! The next mention we have is... of its strange role... in the February 23th coup attempt. Several sources outright state that before Lt. Col. Tejero’s failed coup attempt against the Spanish Congress, a German copy of the book ended up in the hands of the coup members. A translation of the book was commissioned with the goal of hypnotizing the members of the chamber, and therefore carry out the coup with overwhelming efficiency. However, that mission didn’t turn out as they expected. A majority believe someone from that ‘particular group’ made a fatal mistake in the translation. One that luckily doomed any chances of success for the attempt. February 23, 1981 OK there, c’mon. Let’s go. Hey. We listening to Tejero. They been hypo… whatever yet or what? [Coup Members] - Whaddaya mean hippo, wha…? - What the fuck have you done!? [Coup Member #1] What have you done!? [Coup Member #2] Who’s translated that piece of shit of a book!? Lemme see if I haven’t translated the book wrong… A moment, please. Hitler… he’s French. Yes. [Coup Member #2] What are you saying!? Bloody guy’s Norwegian, dammit! [Coup Member #1] Just how is he Norwegian!? He’s from Upper Carabanchel, born and raised! [Coup Member #2] You done fucked up, you buggers! - We’re going, we’re going… - [Coup Member #1] Lemme… I used to go there all the time as a kid… he used to give me candy when… We’re fucked, huh? I… I think I’m bailing out to Argentina. Currently, the book’s whereabouts are unknown. This one, it’s just a prop. [BROKEN OBJECT SOUND] But many think [GUN LOADING SOUND] it lies... [GUN SHOT] Is that my camera? Currently, the book’s whereabouts are unknown. Many believe it lost. But who knows? Who could be the current owner of… “The Art of Hypnosis”?

Because I know you very well, Jaime. C’mon Dani, I’ll look after it as if it were my own. Uh, that’s not the reason I said that. Jaime, we only want to advise you to be cautious.

This is gonna be something to remember. Yeah, right. Just like that time you confessed to the girl with that song, right, you sissy? “You should already know I’ll always love you" Yes, yes, yes. "It’s you I want to kiss With all of my love” And now for the body solo... Why don’t they shoot him already? “You’re my little plushy doll!” Die.

And that loser stays home!? And how the fuck was I supposed to know, huh!? I dunno, I don’t give a shit either way! All of his friends are there anyway. All his gang is there! They’ve all sent each other your picture, Jaime, over fucking Bluetooth… so you know how it is. So… Son of a bitch! Then I could as well have come alone! No, you numbnuts, it’s all the same!

Have you baptised it, now that you’re at it? And finally, a PSP. Dude, drawing a fucking list for three things… What I don’t understand is the PSP. What’s it gonna be for? To keep you there, huddled in a corner without bothering me. Besides, I’ve loaded up Resident Evil for you. I’m still one paragraph from finishing. You haven’t fucking read it yet!? It’s just 6 pages! And they’re the crucial ones! Besides, I need all of my concentration, what I’m gonna do tonight won’t be easy. Won’t be easy? Jaime, what you’re planning is impossible. Nothing is impossible... Lil’ Oscar and the gang, they think good ol’ Jaime... isn’t coming to the party? And what about the girls? Am I not good enough for them? I’m gonna ruin their shit! I’m gonna hypnotize each and every one of the girls! They shall fall in thrall to…! Dude you’re gonna poke out my eye with the camera! Take it easy! Where did I…? Ah yeah. I’ll hypnotize them, one after another. They shall fall by my hand… slaves to our will. Who do you think you are? Van Damme? The powers of the mind, according to that book… are limitless. What’s gonna be limitless on your ass is those girls’ boyfriends, if they catch you. If, they catch US. What a relief, thought you’d forgotten about me. Just… look at it… it’s… I can just see it! Hey. Don’t forget about me, hey! How could you even think of that? Ok dude I’m losing it, just do your thing with the PSP. So these guys, they aren’t back yet? - Those guys? - Not a chance! They haven’t returned from their so-called, “secret mission” yet. C’mon! They’re gonna kill your ass! Yeah, that’s it! C’mon, one more to go, one more to go! Boom, headshot! - Ah for fuck’s sake! - B-but you can’t do that to me! But why? Got you there, yeah, yeah! Let’s see the money! Let’s see the money! There, there! What’s this?

THIS GAME'S A FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT! Yeah, whole lot of “shaise”. “Secret”... Gal, if I had been you I wouldn’t have come at all. Besides, they’ve holed themselves up in that room and they’re not coming out. Seems they’re gonna be like that for at least one more hour. I’m raiding the kitchen. I don’t care, let them stay there. I’m having a shitload of fun. Especially with the guitarist we’ve got there in the corner... (singing) I can't get no... (singing) satisfaction (singing) and I try (singing) and I try, and I try (singing) I can't get no... Overwhelming evidence that guys don’t have a clue how to have fun. I completely agree. Wait a sec, ok? Want anything to drink? Sure… lemon vodka. I’ll be right back. Alright, Eva… I’d like for you and I to hang out some other day… would you like that? Yes, yes, of course. Ok. Ok then, so… I’m leaving, yeah. Sure, sure, see you then. Uh, one sec, wait. I’m gonna get my jacket, you mind going with me? - We’re leaving together then? - Yes. - Fine. - Fine? You want to, then? - Yes. - Ok, let’s go. Sorry to intrude…? “Vamos”, let’s go. Come on. Come in, come in. How are you… Eva? I’m fine… Do you know the name that has been given to these walls… this room? Uh... back... room? Wrong. It’s the "FUCK-tory". You get it? Yes… It's showtime... And now… your minds belong to me! At the count of three, you will fall in a deep slumber! Three! Two! One! Now! Aw yeah! There! There! There’s where I wanted to get! Oh yes! Fuckin’ A! And now… ...you will all... ...turn into…! Motherfucking zombies! I swear, it’s always the same shit, always the same… What? Have I said anything wrong…? No shit? Love…? What’s up… you having second thoughts? There, there, let’s go! Scram!

Look, no fucking way! Who was it that uttered that “motherfucking zombies” sentence then!? Ah… so who was it that said to bring a PSP so I wouldn’t bother? So who’s the dimwit who’s always getting killed playing “Resident Evil”!? And who’s the loser who’s got to use hypnosis to score and doesn’t go up front about it like a man, huh!? What’s up!? The females, dude? That way, man, that way… I’m sticking to you. - (Jaime) No, stay! - Hi mom! Mom! (Jaime) Don’t speak to the camera! The fuck are they gonna do, if they’re just shitty zombies? They’re hypnotized girls who believe themselves zombies, it’s a whole different deal! Holy shit, a conga! I don’t give a shit, dude. Do you even know what’ll happen if we get in there? No, I don’t! They’ll eat us alive and they won’t even leave a scrap of flesh in our bones! Then let’s get it on, dude! I’m not about to be devoured by a horde of hot girls in high heels! Well I’m so going to! Do whatever you want but I’m leaving this place right this way! I’m not gonna listen to you a second more. C’mon, grab my jacket and let’s go. Since when do you have a jacket? Holy shit! Help! She’s too horny for me! Oh god someone help! No more jacket for you! OK, so as I was saying, two things. We are both at fault, whatever. What’s important now is… every man... to himself. (Jaime) Sorry sorry sorry. My bad, my bad, it’s all my fault. Don’t mind me, I’m not here. I’m getting the fuck out of here right now! (JAIME) Aw! Fuckin’ hell. Well, whatever, Gabriel said he was losing his head over her, right? Wait wait… What am I getting so scared about? You’re just shitty zombies! I can just run anytime… Now, now’s not the time. Shit! No! No, God no! You’re gonna kill me! Don’t kill me please, let me live! No, silly! Hahah, poor zombie. C’mon, little one! Aaaah, she’s gonna get me! She’s gonna get me!

Another goof, just another goof! ‘Goof’ is a term for a mistake in a film scene’s continuity. They happen in many films, especially Tom Cruise ones. If in doubt, consult with your nearest cinephile.
