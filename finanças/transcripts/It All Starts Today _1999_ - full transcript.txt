In Belgium for a transport firm Damn The power? - Been cut off for months They're not the only ones We take the kids in when it's cold I'll take them tonight That's all I can do That's nice of you. Thanks I think of Mrs Henry's broken windows And the cold Years ago, my Dad crawled in the mine The slag heaps rose skyward like inverted pits Only lunatics still climb them I know. Cathy phoned Stop it! What's for dinner? - Rabbit in prunes Cool. Sounds good. Pass me the garlic, please I've got a problem It's Rimbaud As I descended impassive rivers" "Guided by the haulers..." No."I no longer felt myself "guided by the haulers "Screaming Redskins made them targets" "nailing them naked..." -No, another "I have my Gaelic ancestors "pale blue eyes "narrow minds, clumsiness in combat "My clothes are as barbaric as theirs "But I don't butter my hair..." I'll skip the rest. - Let's see I have to give my impressions. - So? It's totally dumb Butters his hair? That's his problem "I have my Gaelic ancestors..." Damn, my dinosaur gained 4 ounces! Our region's future lies in tourism We must create a new image, and put an end to Germinal "Nevermore tradition's chains" our opponents sang. We shall act! We'll be modern, hospitable, European Bathe our slag heaps in light No more protectionism! Let's submit to the law of the market Thanks to you, Mr Delaunay, we out a pediatric nurse and a psychologist Don't dramatize, eh? Do you know your national average? 93 percent! "National average"? What's that mean? A meaningless, abstract figure One pediatric nurse for 250 newborn spells disaster here! 45% of our budget goes to social services. You call that abstract? You saved millions on family planning, but we at Child Welfare haven't seen a cent And the funds to fight delinquency? The workers we sent into the field? What about the bookmobile? It's a success, no? But the solution's not... I know. You told me a hundred times: "Not the curing but the preventing" The situation's clear Family planning gets closed down, saving at the expense of the destitute Volunteers are left holding the bag And to create an illusion of progress we invest: We build, cut ribbons and sing the national anthem Nadir, your Daddy's here Can I help her? Her boy's a bit wild Sure. Nadir was fantastic today And don't skimp. Use lots of cheese The pie you buy is too dry Lots of cream, cheese and pepper He hasn't brought a snack in a month We have rules Tomorrow, no snack, I'll send him home I'm sorry I wanted to see you. Malaurie, honey She drank coffee again today She prefers coffee I told you 3 times: No coffee Audrey, honey. No wonder she's wild She knows words like "hedgehog" She's making progress All day he looked at his new shoes You have very nice shoes I want to see Warren's parents He fights. Especially with Margot Are you in love? Go with your grandmother I came for Laetitia. I'm a neighbor You're taking her home Go see the director first Go see him. 'Bye, Laetitia Jeremy any better? - No. I'm fed up I'm sending him to a foster home He's 14. He needs exercise He's a good-for-nothing Now, now Dress them up for class photo day I've come for her, they've sent me here You met my husband yesterday No problem. Just sign her out A pretty scarf! It looks nice on you You're a real princess Can I talk to you? Mrs Henry's okay. - Lf not, call me Can I bring the baby for the photo? Sure. - Thanks You're in great shape! - So it seems But we almost lost it Touch it for good luck Can I see you a minute, Mrs Bry? Payment's not obligatory, but you're two payments behind If all did like you how'd we get by? What do you think the money's for? If helps us pay for Christmas gifts, Easter eggs, a few snacks I don't enjoy asking for money I'm not paying off my car with it 30 francs a term, it's not much I finish my month on 30 francs! Today's the 23rd! Are you saying the 4 of you live on 30f a week? We do! I buy milk and dry biscuits We soak them in the milk It keeps us going for a week I'll work something out Say, I had to calm Mrs Prevel down She says you pulled Julien's hair Now he comes to school crying She's being naive He's a monster. It's draining I know how you feel But you really pulled his hair? He exhausted my patience There are always kids we can't stomach Let's admit: They're not all angels I didn't realize what I was doing It happens to all of us When it does, we should talk We're trained to suppress those feelings, to be ashamed of them So a problem child ends up a scapegoat Julien moved 4 times in 3 years Really? May we pass, Sophie? - Please At training college, they said I'd be more like a social worker They tell you that now? - Yes That's good! What else? Nothing. They just say it Candy? - Thanks Lice are a real problem And I can't give them Kwell shampoos It's considered a drug Anyway, it does no good The whole family's lice-ridden They live in filth. Call the Services I did. They said they'd do something We have to act. Expel the child! Sure, it's in the regulations And why not kids with runny noses? You louse! Why bother with these meetings? The toilets are in a deplorable state And the wash-room faucet! And the gastroenteritis! And the heat is broken again I reported to the City and the board You fight a lot and obtain little We're fed up. Let's draft a petition Send it to the mayor and the press I'm all for it I can help you draft it but officially, I know nothing If they find out, it won't help So what do you suggest? I'm for it, but there are bigger problems, like overcrowding And with more problem families, the City can do nothing This should be a Priority District: 25 to a class, additional resources It's up to the high-school principal to request priority status It's not easy Then why won't she It gives a bad image So, do we do a petition? - Sure But I warned you Let's wish Michele a happy birthday Hi, Juliette. - Hi, Daniel In City Hall they said you'd be here Do you know Mrs Henry? The wino? We have a fish special. - Fine Forget about the electric company Especially Mrs Etchabery. A bitch The Dauby family: 2 kids, mid-winter Even the senator got involved No one cares. Tried Child Welfare? They hung up on me Confidential! What's so confidential? Everybody knows they're in the shit I can put together a care package But the mother has to pick it up She'll never come. - Regulations They have to show their good will A sense of responsibility This could go on for years I'm sure the girl goes hungry The school meals? - Too expensive Those kinds blow aid money on booze "Those" have a baby and a 5-year old So what can we do, now? I can't see to evreyone! OK, I'll apply for assistance But you have to wait a bit 10 meals at 12 francs, that's 120f Say it's from the City Hands in the air! What hands! Covered in paint! Someone's here... I said no. Especially if it's a rep It's not. And Mrs Meriaux is here... Mrs Meriaux! Just looking Sure. You'll see her at 4:20 All right already, I'm going Next time I'll really lose my temper Goodbye, Mrs Meriaux! Mrs Duhem I heard about the Henry family I wasn't in Never mind that. It's absurd that a case worker won't give me information and hangs up when I'm stuck with a kid We're snowed under! This isn't the first time It's hell to get you here! I report cases, you do nothing Like the 4-year-Olds' Checkup! It's always put off No doctors, no nurses... It's intolerable! Enforce the law, dammit! We're doing our best... We should be working together For children, nothing's confidential Until all the problems are ironed out you people won't set foot in here! Goodbye. I'm sorry What're you looking at me for? Problem's settled If you say so. - I do They did the cross-tabulation table Bravo. It's always a nightmare for me Too much noise in here! See you tomorrow, Mrs Delacourt You really flew off the handle If the Inspector hears we're in for it You did good, you'll get your stripes I know those inspectors They'll fix your wagon Did you see how Laetitia lives? She sleeps in her hat and mittens You see? 20 years ago, I had 45 pupils We didn't complain. 45 pupils! We had discipline. They came on time And they were clean Back then there was poverty too It's all changed now I have 30 pupils but I can't cope They arrive late, and they're filthy The parents are often in straits Few of them are working The kids don't know what working means Worse, they have only me to talk to Hope? Not tell myself they'll go to college I don't believe that now It's just to give them affection, because I'm attached to them That's the only hope I have left If you could see those kids... they're in a sorry state So small, so vulnerable The mothers don't tend to them As if they want to be rid of them They send their kids to school sick! They watch TV all day then they stick the kids in front of the TV Even during dinner. The result: We have to teach them everything Even to say hello And not only that... Some of them don't even know that you can actually talk to people For them, words are for saying: "I'm hungry, I'm cold. I'm thirsty" It's survival Did you hit her? Shit. I forgot There's room for improvement Drinks, Dad. Daniel raised hell again On the house? - That's right A beer Go on, serve him a beer Hello, Laetitia. - Hi Your Mommy in? - She's asleep This is for her. And you, too Can I put this here? Did you get a look? It's nice to say something sometimes You can call me Daniel What is it? - I want to sing The same? Who's winning? - We are We have 8, 10 and 11 We even have little Gregory who came despite a foot operation First shot! It's not normal That's Mrs Bry. I'll go talk to her Hello, Wendy. You okay? Give me a little kiss? No kiss for me? This is Valeria What's your name? - Sulky Wendy Even the birthday cookies The times I've requested a real lock! They even tore up the class photos Any idea who did it? Local kids. No need to look far Took the VCR, the TV and my camcorder Bad luck So what did you come for? Run the usual fingerprint check I did it for you. For the insurance No breaking and entering, no cash With the windows I smash, I could cash in as a glazier There's no class today We have to clean up It's dangerous. Glass all over Thieves? - Yeah. Bad thieves Can anyone give us a hand cleaning? You explained? - Yes. We'll manage Her Mom left her. She didn't know You know her? - I can take her Arne't you insured? - Sure we are But right now we have nothing And it was my camcorder See you, honey We saved a piece for you Thanks. You shouldn't have My husband Nice to meet you So you're a truck driver? I run material to working sites Come tell the kids about your job? I wouldn't know how Show them how a truck works Kids love that But it's not my truck I'll talk to your boss Should he bring his truck to school? We've come to help. We're four I'm coming. - I'll get you a broom Did the City contact you? They want to see us? We'd rather manage on our own If I find 4 days of work I lose my benefits But that's for unemployment Unemployment, the City, all alike Always checking up on us It's not our fault we have no work They might take our kids away That's not why they contacted you So, they took your camcorder? - Yes Come on, we need you! I have to go Don't worry The Henry notice is just for the care package? Let them know. They're scared stiff They're right to be scared Okay, I won't keep you Making headway? - Not much. Gotta scrub That's a yogurt stain I'm taking the garbage out We'll never make it It's happened twice before It makes me sick I'm from Child Welfare. - What now? Wasn't I clear with Mrs Duhem? - Listen You listen! I let you in only when you start tackling the real problems! I'm sorry. Goodbye Someone's ringing. - I know Aren't you getting it? - It's OK Still ringing. - May be the plumber Dammit... Slam the door in my face again and I'll keep ringing until 5! Yes, we hung up on you and it's wrong but that's no reason to play Rambo Especially with a broom And I think you could use some help Samia Damouni. Pediatric nurse I started last month Can't control your pupils? Very funny Know how many we are here? - No 4 over 4,000 people including 300 problem families We need twice as many nurses We have one doctor for 5,000 children We do the checkup when we can That's illegal. - Sure, it's illegal! But nobody gives a damn! Including many of your colleagues We're no better. Some of us lie low and leave the dirty work to others So I have to wait 5 more years? - No You made a stink. You'll get it soon With bonus, like in a box of cereal The Inspector's summons This thing's got him wired As usual. - As usual But you know... This ruckus may help speed things up These drawings are wonderful. - Yes We did a show last year Lolita did that. A bit wild You can tell from the colors Dylan. That's Wendy... a bit sadder That's Clayton's Dylan, Wendy, Clayton... Texas. - "The Young and the Restless" Micauel dumps Pamela who meets Jack A registrar's nightmare But I shouldn't complain. Mrs Lienart has twins: Starsky and Hutch I've had it with your bullshit! Thefts, smashed-up phones, slit tires! We get 50 calls a week! We don't even go 'cause it's always 12-13 year old punks like you whose parents neglect them! What were you gonna do with the VCR and TV? Tell me! Every jobless family here has a TV! Look how filthy you are! Didn't you learn to wash? You mug old ladies and shoplift Now you sack a school! No limits! Deadbeats! Good for nothings! This time you're going to prison D'you have a toy truck? - A tractor The crane comes forward, then opens It picks up things That's a crane? It's high! Here. That's the hook What can you put in a truck? Straw! - A car! It was a good idea I think they enjoyed it Goodbye! Lindsey, hold Brice's hand Can I talk to you? - Of course Enough with your bullshit! Come out! Come out or I break the door in! I didn't do anything! I didn't go in! I wanted to play a prank. - A prank? You've got a pea for a brain! You don't give a damn! Just dinosaurs and stupid video games! Come out or I break the door in! But I didn't go in You've no right! You're not my father! Can I see you a minute? What're you doing here? You look awful... I feel awful I slapped Remi. He was with the two kids who wrecked my school It can't be! - The cops told me He says it was to play a prank on me He slipped them the key. Some prank! I lost it and slapped him That's wrong. Why didn't you call me? Why? I don't know Because I'm stupid Because I screw up Because your kid hates me Stop talking nonsense Is Remi alone? Yes, but he's OK I can't believe it! Don't worry Shall we go? Daniel, you lock up! Want to talk? Who do you hang out with? Those kids are thugs! Answr me, why d'you do it? You want to ruin our life? You get a kick out of hurting Daniel? You don't get it! They aren't my pals But at least their real Dads hit them I don't know mine. - Don't start You always pull that on me! Tell me about him. What's his name? I have a right to know! Your father doesn't exist. He's scum Then why did you fuck him? Your mother didn't "fuck" I was 17, young, I loved dancing I felt good in his arms It's not all. I was born. His son! You're not! You're nothing for him! He wanted me to get an abortion! That's the truth! When I said I wouldn't, he vanished I didn't try to see him again You really caused a stir Take kids home... see what it gets us? I'm knotting my tie. Mrs Duhem's here You're handsome I called you at the Minister's request to revive the dialogue between you, school directors, and social services A difficult dialogue, to judge from incidents in this district I won't mention names To foster better coordination, I'll ask the various social services to define their tasks lt'll benefit us all He's dodging the issues Who will begin? I'm a case worker. Karine Duhem I see to problem families in the field I often deal with serious problems: Hygiene, health, alcoholism, incest, domestic violence... The list is long The Inspector, whom I thank, pointed out that our difficult work is aggravated by certain teachers, who play the social worker I resent that last remark Hold on, Mr Lefebvre The social services have the floor This isn't a talk show Let them have their say. Thank you Smoking here brings back memories Some coordination meeting! You shut up and listen to people who are acoountable to no one Sure, it's pointless Anyway, we're not social workers On the Gauss Curve, the middle counts They can still be saved The others are a lost cause We're no God. We're underpaid as it is Your Gauss Curve is crap I have nothing but problem kids While society implodes, we gather around the Leader to hear the Gospel What a waste of time! We're not an ambulance service! The hard cases take all our time So we throw half in the trash and see what we can do with the rest? The trash can's growing. It'll blow up It's easy to blame others But I have a computer class, a school paper, class trip to Paris Methods that work. - Methods, eh? Remember Laurent? The strait jacket? Maybe you saved 10 with your Curve But what about Laurent? He may kill himself or someone else Lots of kids are on the edge and no one talks to them They don't need a social worker but someone to listen to them To the man who's put up with my girl for two years! He is truly... He is truly phenomenal... Remi, go to Daniel. Be nice Make an effort. It's my birthday Go talk to him! - Leave me alone! You're not my buddy! The mines. The rolling mills. Closed Men show children the apple-tree road, the brick-warmed sky, the carp's round belly Water flows in the woods We pass as if the earth would make us stronger. Humbler Snow fills out the bodices Crows dance with fairies There's Mormal and the hidden ponds Virgins buried under the chapel stones 20 poplars stand at the village gates 1st month he had a dr.'s certificate but it's only good for a week, not 3 Joel is delicate 32 pupils are hard enough So how do I fight for him?

Then it's too late Excuse me. It's for the milk In 5 minutes Yes. I understand It's tough, eh? But if you give up, what can I do?

Quietly What happened, Jimmy? Did you fall? No? Who hurt you? - Nobody Nobody? You sure? Did you fight with someone? What do you think? I can't say Let me see your back again The bruises seem faint It's not enough for a report You must tell me if anyone hurts you No one has the right to hurt you No me, not Cathy, not Mommy or Daddy. No one No one has the right to hurt you The title "Balloons in the Sky" On which photo? Yes. Very good Where is it? Look at the word, Kelly What's this word? - "Balloon" Now you, Nicolas Mom!

Want some? - No That's how she is, you know Yeah, I'll have some To your health, kiddo That's how she is Are you angry? I won't say that again Can I see what you wrote? - No Your father comes home next week Did he say anything? He's too weak No one came to see him He hasn't talked to anyone in years You don't need an oxygen bottle just to go to the toilet This tastes like mud It's your father's coffee Miners's coffee, not teachers' Can you fix the living-room outlet? It's time to move out of here Dad won't leave the mining village His whole life is here Read Charlotte Delbo first She combs the snow like winter That falls about her breasts and face Love slipe through hair and fingers A multitute lying in blood She combs the snow The way is long through the fields She combs the snow, yes She prays, if praying is this newfound slowness, this surprise Gentle tears in hands and voice Gentleness of being nothing in the most serene seconds...

They need to eat! The Council voted. It had no choice! It's costing us too much money It's only 20 francs. - Times hundreds Some owe 5 months We're feeding their kids for free! And hungry kids? - Don't lecture me! I have a 34% unemployment rate It's bad. I'd love a solution 25% of my budget is social 8 schools, no money, no jobs! I'm fighting for emergency funding! I wrote the Minister. - The kids? It's up to their parents Nice going... A Communist mayor! - Forget it There are things I can and cannot do! It's all political now "I need a job, I need a flat..."

Am I the only union member here? It's useless. I was, for 10 years They do help in certain domains For our pay raises, but otherwise they're only interested in perks And we rank as qualified teachers I'm unionized just for that? No, to earn 1,000fr more a month What commitment! Should we sing The International? You remember it? To you How's the wine? The truth? - Yes These three are fine OK.
