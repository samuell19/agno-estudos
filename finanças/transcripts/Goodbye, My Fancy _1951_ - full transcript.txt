They must be having it hot and heavy in there this time. My money is still on the chairman. I don't know. Pretty stiff opposition in there. Five will get you ten. Young man, you just lost yourself a sawbuck. How about it, congressman? - What about food prices? Any Decisions? A great many decisions. All from the chairman. Any statement, Mr Congressman? Frankly, I haven't the voice left to make one. How about you, sir? - What's the use? The chairman would have the last word anyhow. Don't talk to me. Here comes the chairman, boys. Good morning, Miss Reed. - Hi fellows. What the word, Miss Reed? - Who won? Bacon and eggs going up or down? Well, I'm very busy. Will you settle for 50 words? Sure. - Shoot. We decided to intensify an investigation into the high cost of food. I think the housewife has been getting in the neck long enough. And I am not going to stop fighting until the American family .. Can once again afford to take a vacation once a year. See a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant. That's it, boys. - Right. Quote and unquote. More mail from your constituents. One more speech like the last one and you get the Post Office out of the red. I must be at the American Teacher's Federation in an hour. Any new mail? Better get these out the way. They're piling up. Invitations. An assortment. Marion Dennis radio interview about my book. I've avoided him for weeks. I am afraid .. a yes. Winston Milner, A small dinner party. An emphatic no. He is a wolf. Good Hope College. Why, it is from Good Hope. So? They want to give me an honorary degree. What is so special about that? You've turned down degrees from Vassar and Wellesley without blinking an eye. But you don't understand, Woody. I went to Good Hope. Oh. Pardon me. Take a letter. Shall I type it on parchment? Huh? No. Special delivery. Dr James Merrill. Good Hope College. Good Hope, Massachusetts. My dear Jim. I can't tell .. You had better make that: "Dear Dr Merrill". I can't tell you how happy I was to receive your gracious invitation. To return to Good Hope. For an honorary degree. "Good Hope has always been close to me." "And nothing short of a congressional crisis .." "Could keep me away from this commencement." "And if I may be sentimental." "It would give me great pleasure to be able to stay in my old rooms." "Sincerely. Agatha Reed." Get me Mr Griswold please. Dr Merrill, sir. Morning, Jim. Yes? She did, huh? Fine. Fine. Anything else on your mind? Any problems? Good. Good. I'd like to make this one of the best commencements we've ever had. Right. Goodbye. Well, you'll be seeing your old room-mate in a couple of weeks. She accepted? Oh sweetie, how wonderful. It will be marvellous seeing Aggie again after all these years. Claude. As chairman of the board of trustees. Don't you think it would be nice if you write and tell her how glad we all are? I'll take care of when I get to the office. Just imagine. Good Hope College giving an honorary degree to a girl who was once expelled. Expelled? Now look, Jim. I value Good Hope's reputation for broad-mindedness as much as anyone. But giving a degree to a girl who was once expelled .. For staying out all night? That will make us the most broad-minded college in the history of education. Well Claude, what would you suggest? - Call the whole thing off. I'm afraid it is too late for that. I've given the announcement to the papers. And Life Magazine is sending a man up to cover the commencement exercises. Life Magazine? That is ducky. If they ever find out about Agatha Reed being expelled .. We will all wind up on the cover. I always knew from her voting record in congress there was trouble in her past. I don't know how I ever let you bulldoze me into it. There's a dozen other women to choose from .. But we pick a hot potato like Agatha Reed. Why? Well, Good Hope meted out some pretty harsh punishment .. To Agatha Reed and I think it's time we told her we were sorry. More, since she left here she became one of the outstanding women in the nation. A woman who has won recognition as a columnist .. War correspondent .. and author. What do you want to do about the Madison Square Garden rally? The what? The rally in Madison Square. - Do we have to talk about that now? Well it's a big place. They would like to fill it, and preferably with people. Alright. Tell them sometime next month. They have to have a definite date so they can advertise. After all, the world doesn't stop. Not even for honorary degrees. You needn't shout so, Woody. You suppose the room service got lost? - I'll check. How about the 15th? - Alright. Room service? If we are not busy. - Well, we could .. What happened to the warm milk for 1202? It doesn't have to be in a bottle. This is for a big girl. Maybe they are not so wrong at that. Meaning what? This trip back to the cradle. A crowded calendar, two important bills coming out of committee. An election not four months away and we are off to braid a daisy-chain. Now look Woody. Let's get this straight right now. I am going to enjoy this weekend. And if I feel like acting like a kid, I will. I am going to be sentimental. I am going to cry. I am going to walk barefoot down memory lane with ivy entwined in my hair. And if you don't like it you don't have to look. I'll bring my dark glasses along. Yes. Please do. What time do we leave? - Midnight. Car 66. Drawing-room "B". On the New Yorker. I'll pick you up in a cab around 11:30. And please be ready. - I will. Woody. - Yeah? Leave the door unlocked for room service, will you. Yes, ma'am. A great way to spend a weekend. Down. Picking ivy leaves out of my hair. Come in. The door is open. Just put it on the table. Will it hold? That's right, Aggie. Life Magazine's favorite photographer. And yours. Matt. The usual greeting after five years is: "Well, this is a surprise". Sorry. But you caught me off guard. I didn't think that was possible. Men don't usually come barging into my rooms at this hour. They ought to. You'll get a lot more votes. I see you haven't changed. No. Neither have you. You're a little more dignified, perhaps. A little more, shall we say, refined. But underneath just as attractive as ever. I thought you were in Europe. When did you get back? - Late this afternoon. I had a couple of hours to kill so I thought I'd stop in and say hello. What was that? Oh yes. Thank you. I will. I am sorry. Soda. No ice. Of course. I'm afraid we don't have any brandy. I've switched to Bourbon. But it was nice of you to remember. Incidentally, I am curious about that date we had in Paris. When you didn't show up for five years I began to wonder. Is it on or off? Matt, I am sure you didn't come here to dig all that up. What do you really want? Do you mind telling me why you didn't show up? Does it matter now? - Well, of course it matters. When a woman runs out on a man you want to know why. Were his trousers too short or his hair too long? A man likes to know the reason. It helps him the next time. I suppose it never occurred to you I may have been in love with someone else? It occurred to me but I rejected it. Really? Why? Because I have kept tabs on you, Aggie. It hasn't been hard. Not with a congresswoman. By the way, congratulations. You are doing a great job. What about before I was a congresswoman? Those were my years. And the years before that? Don't tell me it's the boy next door who used to pull your pigtails? No. It was a little later than that. My hair was bobbed. Why haven't you done something about the guy? Do you think I should? If you love him. Maybe I will. Now do you mind? I'm in the midst of packing. I'll help. We will stay out here. You are not afraid, Aggie? Certainly not. Hotel rules. Thank you. Chanson ? lui, huh? Still faithful to him. You know, if I had known that I'd have smuggled in a couple of jugs. It is easier to get now. What is it? You know, I never got a chance to ask you. Did you ever get those pictures I sent you from China? Yes, I did. Did you like the one of yourself? There were several. Which one do you mean? The one on the Orient Express nearing Paris. No. I didn't like it. - Why not? The one time you don't expect to be photographed is .. Asleep in a train compartment. It was a pretty special train compartment as I recall. It was unfair. You caught me off guard then too. Asleep is the best time, Aggie. Nothing false. No attitude. I wasn't thinking as a photographer. - Neither was I. And besides. The occasion wasn't exactly the kind of thing I wanted recorded for posterity. That's funny. I felt it had the makings of one of the big moments in history. Come to think of it, you did too. I see that Bourbon works even faster on you than brandy. That is why I switched to it. Matt, please. Can't I make you understand? It was fun, but .. War has a way of making little moments seem big at the time. Very penetrating. Mind if I use it sometime? I'm sorry if I said it badly. But it's true. Matt, you see we were .. Well, we were .. - Yes, Aggie. We were a nice snapshot but never a family portrait. Oh, I get it. It is subtle, but I get it. You really must leave now. I have to catch the New Yorker at midnight. The New Yorker? Yes. And I only have an hour to pack, dress and get to the station. Aggie, I could Kick myself all the way from here to Alaska. I've been holding you up with idle chit-chat .. And all the time we're going to be travelling companions. You are going to be on that train? Happy, happy coincidence. You know, a compartment on the New Yorker .. Could become like the good old Orient Express. Not anymore. I know what trains do to some people. So long. See you on the New Yorker. Western Union please. This is Agatha Reed, 1202. I want to send a straight wire. To Dr James Merrill. Good Hope College, Massachusetts. Come in. Have you got that? Alright. Please don't have anyone meet train. I am flying down. Signed Agatha Reed. Get that out right away. Your warm milk, Miss Reed. I've changed my mind. Take that back and bring me a double brandy. Yes, ma'am. When you change your mind Miss Reed, you certainly change it. From the President's office. Oh good. Upstairs. Third door to the right. Miss Dodge and Miss Merrill's room. Hang it over the fireplace. Why all this fuss? Old pictures, old sofas. A lot of lugging around. For only three days. Miss Reed is going to stay in her old rooms. And it was my idea to have them looking exactly as they did. When she was a student here. I am sure she will appreciate it. The janitors won't. - Well. The things you can accumulate if four years. You're telling me. But isn't it exciting, Mary Nell? You mean about graduation? In my case it is a miracle. No. I mean Agatha Reed. Imagine her living in these very rooms. Looking at the same walls. Studying at the same desk. Yeah and using the same bathroom. It gives me goose pimples. I wonder what she is like. - Hippy probably. It's my experience that most women with brains it goes right to their hips. I didn't mean what she looks like. Whatever you meant it hasn't done her much good. She is still single. Maybe she considers other things more important. All I know is, on cold winter nights you can't snuggle up to a voting machine. Is that all? - Just about. Right on the button. - How's the phone coming? Be ready in a minute. Testing. - Yeah. Hey. That's uncle Willy. Uncle Willy? No, Ginny. It's the laughing cavalier .. - By Frans Hals. I know. We always called him uncle Willy. Father has one like it in the office. This is the same one. It used to hang here they tell me. Don't look at me. Hello, Ed? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it is all set. You can use it now. - Thanks. Do you mind if I keep the number? Hmm, it's getting chilly. Cute. Better not let Sam here you say that. Yeah. But I wish we'd had a better phone all this time. Then I could have talked to him without the whole floor listening in. It didn't seem to inhibit you any. - I know. But there's something about talking to a man when you are lying down. [ Telephone ] Well, answer it. Hello? What? It's New York. No. No, she hasn't arrived yet. "Life Magazine." What? - "Life Magazine." Life Magazine. That's right. Life Magazine. The executive office. Look, when Miss Reed arrives, will you tell her .. Listen, Matt. - Just a moment, please. Another call just came in. Hold the line. What are trying to do, queer the whole thing? No. I just don't think we are going to get away with it. Switching assignments just like that? It's a cinch. One day you will come to me on your knees. Yeah, I know. The boss cut my legs off. Listen Matt, I don't .. - Would you hold the phone? It's the London office. Please. Just a moment. Look. You've always wanted a foreign assignment, haven't you? Now is your big chance. All you need is a little confidence. Confidence? - Yeah. Two more of the same. Nothing for me. Hello. When Miss Reed arrives tell her we have sent one of our best men, Matt Cole. I certainly will. Life are sending up one of their best me to cover the whole weekend. Matt Cole. The war photographer? I wonder why they're sending him. Maybe they are expecting trouble. This must be it. Put them over there. Thank you. How do you do. I am Ginny Merrill and this is my room-mate Mary Nell Dodge. How are you? It's a great honor to have you here. Her old room. It's too much for her. Did you notice the sofa? - Huh? The sofa. It could stand re-covering, couldn't it. They thought you'd like it that way. - They carted it up from the basement. And the picture. The picture. Did they cart him up from the basement too? This I take it is the bedroom? It looks like they emptied the basement. Anyway, I was right. - About what? I forgot. There was phone call. Mr Cole will be here as soon as he can. - Good. We can always use an extra man. Who is he? Matt Cole from Life Magazine. Oh. That kind of man. I hate Life photographers. They always try to catch you picking your nose. We had better go, Mary Nell. And leave Miss Reed alone with her memories. Miss Reed is alone with her memories. Outside under a tree. Well then, who ..? - Me? I just carry the typewriter. Oh, you are her secretary? I am so glad. Well, don't shoot off any firecrackers. She must be under the willows. Your reception committee. Here she is, girls. The main event. Gosh. I thought like I was in church. Doesn't anybody know she is here? - I doubt it. She stopped the taxi two blocks away so that she could take a shortcut. Through the alfalfa field behind the gym. "Memory lane", she called it. We had better tell them she is here. Give her five minutes. Let her have a good cry. We'll give her ten. - Five is enough. Let's not overdo it. - Roger dodger. Rodger dodger. You know Woody, I haven't cried in years. It feels wonderful. It looks fierce. You just don't understand, do you. Come here. Look out there. I bet all you see is a collection of buildings, some ivy and some students. What do you see? Myself at eighteen. Eager, expectant. A little frightened. Asking, what is life? What am I? This is where it all starts, Woody. I don't believe in looking at the past. I was born in Newark, New Jersey. Every time I go through on the train I pull down on the shades. I am sorry for you, Woody. If you don't have something like this to remember. Nothing. What now? There's a secret panel in this desk. I used to keep brownies in it to keep them from Ellie. Who was Ellie? - My room-mate. You share your clothes, your perfume .. And even your themes with your room-mate but never your .. Brownies. Gadzooks, they must be stale. Mmm. Fresh this week. Go on, have one. - No thanks. They stick to my teeth. [ Door knocks ] Come in. I am sorry to disturb you, Miss Reed. But I forgot something. I am afraid I found them. They are wonderful. Oh, you keep them. Thanks. You won't have to twist my arm. I don't get good brownies very often. I made them myself. - Really? What do you use, whole chocolate or ground? Chocolate syrup. That is the secret. It's what keeps them so moist. I must remember that. Oh brother. If you two will excuse me. I've got some fudge in my briefcase. I didn't really come for the brownies. Is it so good you have to hide it? This weekend, yes. Oh. Dr Pitt said we all ought to read it. Your English teacher? - No. Physics. I don't quite get the connection. You would if you knew Dr Pitt. In his classes you learn about everything. It sounds as if I'd like to know him. Miss Reed. I hate to bother you but .. Now that I am here. Would you autograph it? I would love to. As an author I don't get the opportunity as often as I hopped. To ..? Virginia. Would you make it "Ginny"? Sure. Ginny Merrill. Your parents. Will they be here for commencement? There is just my father. Mother died in my freshman year. Does your father have to come very far? Well, no. As a matter of fact .. - You're Jim Merrill's daughter, right? Why yes. - I might have known. I knew your father very well. He was my favorite professor. I keep forgetting father once taught history here. Miss Reed. Would you tell me something? Certainly. - What was he like? Well, he was very handsome. All the girls were in love with him. They still are. But that is not what I meant. Was he .. was he a good teacher? Yes. Very. He had a way of making history come to life. Not just dates and battles. But real things that happened to real people. I wish he were still a teacher. Why? Is being president of the college so bad? It's .. different. How do you mean, different? It just is. That's all. I'd better be going, Miss Reed. I am supposed to be dressing to meet you. Oh, Ginny. Yes? You forgot this. Thank you. I'd go light on that stuff if you want to stay photogenic. Life Magazine is covering the weekend. Oh? How nice. They must think you're pretty important. They are sending out Matt Cole. Who did you say? Matt Cole, the war photographer. You are joking. No. One of the kids just took the message. But why should they send him up here? This isn't his type of thing. Maybe he needs a vacation. Get Life Magazine on the phone immediately. I'll put a stop to this right now. Why bother? I want to bother. So don't argue. Okay. You are the boss. Get me New York. Yeah, Life Magazine. I must speak to Henry Luce personally. Make that person-to-person to Henry Luce, will you. What's all the rush? Is this a matter of life and death? I said don't argue. Huh? The circuits are busy. Well, keep after it. - Keep after it. We will see about Mr Cole coming up here. Come in. Hello. - Hello. I am Ellie. Oh Ellie. Yes. - Where is she? She's having a shower. I'll tell her you're here. No, wait. I want to surprise her. Okay. Ellie. It's me, Ag. Ellie. It's so good to see you again. It's just like old times, isn't it. - Oh yes. It is. See what they did to the rooms? - They told me about it. Wasn't it wonderful of them to remember? - Yes. Did they bring back Uncle Willy? - Yes. He doesn't look a minute older. Ag, I am so excited I could cry. She wanted it to be a surprise. What about that phone call? I will give it the old college try. Well. Well, what's this? Just some old things I've saved. I dug them out when I heard you were coming. You will love it. There. The sketch I made of Smitty in art class. You put the moustache on with real hair, remember? Yes. And the Clara Bow doll. You forgot to take it with you when you left. And this! This is one of your favorites. Remember it? We'll look at these later, Ellie. I've not had a chance to look at you yet. Well, I've gained a little weight, I know. Too many bridge luncheons. And Claude won't let me diet. Claude? Oh yes, that's your husband, isn't it. He sent me a very nice note. - Oh, I do hope you like him. It is so cute the interest he takes in the school. He is always giving them things. Last year it was a projection booth and movie equipment. So. They've changed the name of the theater to, guess what? The Griswold theater. Why, yes. How did you know? Miss Shackelford wrote me and asked me to bring a film. Yes of course, Ag. Your film. It sounds perfectly delightful. Well I'd hardly call it that. It's a documentary illustrating a speech I once made. I'm surprised she even knew about it. Well anyway, I just think it's wonderful. With you being so famous and all. You know Ag, I'm always talking about how I knew you and when. Of course I never say a word about you being .. Expelled. I don't think there will be very much said about that this weekend. I never did understand it, Ag. The student court was so hush-hush about it nobody could find out a thing. Of course, everyone knew there was a man connected with it. You're not expelled for staying out all night unless there's a man connection. Who was it, Ag? Ellie. There are some brownies in there on the desk. Was it Jack Parker? I always thought you had a secret crush on him. They are fresh-made. - Was it Teddy Mills? Come on, Ag. You can tell little old me. You know, Ellie. I get the most peculiar feeling that you haven't changed at all. Thank you. That's what Claude says. Come. Let's try the brownies. He says he'll divorce me if I ever do change. What? Chicago says what? Alright then. Try Los Angeles. But ring us back. This is its important. Delicious. Whole chocolate That's the secret. Chicago thinks he's on his way to Los Angeles. Good. Don't lose him. What's that? Oh, it is the reception committee. Why, there is Miss Shackelford and the student committee. And Miss Birdshaw with the merry lark. And a man. Why, it's doctor Pitt. It is just like Miss Shackelford to pull a boner and put him on the committee. You mean Dr Pitt the physics professor? Yes. Why a boner? Claude says he's a trouble maker. Jim is going to get rid of him. Ellie. Why do they consider Dr Pitt a troublemaker? I don't know. It's to do with school politics. I keep out of stuff like that. I just leave it to Claude. I always say, the less women worry about politics the better. Oh. Except congresswomen of course. My, they do look nice though, don't they. Oh. I'm supposed to be with them. That's what I came up here to tell you. They are holding the reception downstairs. That's because you came by plane instead of my train. You see we .. I'd better be going. You'd better hurry and get dressed too, Ag. I will see you downstairs. Woody. Here she comes. "A sort of welcome we sing to you." "To gather here upon this day." "Of happy greetings we bring to you." Dr Merrill, I think you ought to be the first to greet her. "To all who gather here." "Welcome again." May I say how very pleased we are to have you back at Good Hope, Miss Reed. I am glad to be back, Dr Merrill. "Welcome again." "Welcome, welcome." "And banish sorry tears." "And share the joy." "Welcome to you." "Dear Agatha .." "Reed." Good Hope is honored to welcome back one of its favorite graduates. Thank you, Miss Shackelford. But not quite a graduate. Practically. Professor Dingley, it is so good to see you again. It is good to see you, Agatha. Miss Reed. You remember Miss Birdshaw? Biology. How could I ever forget Miss Birdshaw. She taught me the facts of life. Well, I never really thought of it that way. You look wonderful, Miss Birdshaw. So do you, Agatha. Of course a bit older but .. I mean a woman instead of a .. Miss Birdshaw means you look so young to be in Congress. Yes. Congress thought so too, Miss Birdshaw. At least for the first few months. Until September the 14th to be exact. Your speech on the United Nations. I don't believe you know Dr Pitt, Agatha. Our physics professor. He came to us a few years ago. How do you do, Dr Pitt. How do you do. It is very gratifying your knowing my speech. You know, sometimes you get the feeling on the floor of congress, like .. Well, like being on the radio. You are not so sure anyone is listening. - I know what you mean. I get somewhat the same feeling in my classroom. And this is your Honor Guard. Chosen to represent the activities of the college this weekend. Carol Freedman. President of Student Government. Student Government presents you this bouquet Miss Reed as a token of respect. For one who has so well demonstrated the principles .. That women can take their rightful place .. Beside men in the government of this great nation. Joan Wintner. Physical education. Phys-Ed welcomes Agatha Reed .. Who has the spirit of good sportsmanship and fair play in all that she does. Clarisse Carter. Dramatic class. In the theater of life. You have made woman's role more important .. And more truly rich. We at the dramatics club .. applaud you. Agatha Reed. And last, Virginia Merrill. Representing the graduating seniors. The seniors asked me to thank you for coming to our commencement, Miss Reed. Because your presence here gives us courage and reassurance .. When we need it most. Thank you. I have thought a great deal about Good Hope in the past few years. Because of a growing feeling. That the good hope of our world lies in the young. And more importantly. In the places where they are taught to think. In standing here now with all of you. I feel that more strongly than ever. And I have too .. The fine warm feelings of coming home. Can I help? - Thank you, Woody. My secretary, Miss Woods. - How do you do. Dr Merrill. Ag, it was just lovely. I think we'd all better get along now. We have a very full day ahead. Alright, girls. A wonderful speech, Miss Reed. - Thank you, professor. An inspiring speech, Agatha. Thank you, Miss Birdshaw. - See you later. I've enjoyed meeting you, Miss Reed. I never expected to be put on your reception committee. It was a pleasant surprise. - How kind of you, doctor. Well, that was certainly uncalled for. I can see now what Claude means. Ellen, what about the arrangements for the faculty dinner? Faculty dinner? Oh! I must go and check my guest list. I have lost part of the class of '34. See you later, Ag. Oh, Agatha. I hope you didn't forget that film we sent for. We are supposed to show it Saturday morning at ten. Didn't it get here? We sent it out several days ago. Sent it? Oh, dear, I thought you would bring it. What does it look like? - It is round, in a tin can. Like sardines? Perhaps they delivered it right to the theater Miss Shackelford. I had better go down and see. Woody, you'd better go with her. She may not recognise it. Recognise, it? She probably ate it. You mustn't mind Woody. Her mind is always on the tip of her tongue. You are looking very well, Agatha. Thank you, Jim. I suppose you realize you are in for quite a weekend. Yes. I have seen the agenda. I .. Can turn my back if you would like to escape. I wouldn't think of it. Vanity, I guess. I suppose everyone dreams of returning to his college for an honorary degree. It is a popular ambition like .. Like wanting a mink coat. Or to be President. - Yes. How does it feel? Well. It is never dull. Faces chance so often. And with so much youth around .. You actually get the feeling that you are preserving your own. Well your daughter should keep you young. Oh yes, we've met. We had a nice talk. She is a lovely child. No, that is wrong. She is not a child. What are we at that age, Jim? That wonderful, terrible in-between time. You have seen so many others. Tell me about yourself, Agatha. Have you been happy? Well .. I've been busy. Yes, I know. I've followed your career very closely. In that case I won't have to bring you up to date on the past twenty years. No. Only the first one. I never quite caught up on the first one. You will forgive my being curious. Perhaps it is my vanity. But .. all these years I've wondered what happened. Why you just .. Disappeared. It was stupid of me to be found climbing in my window at five in the morning. I hope the present crop of girls is more expert. I wouldn't know. I am not up on the statistics. Obviously, I am not saying this very well. I shouldn't have brought it up. - Listen, Jim. It would have made no difference to the trustees that you were the man .. And we planned to be married. I would have been kicked out anyway. Only you would have been kicked out with me. I thought we decided to take the chance. - I couldn't have let you do it. They were already eyeing you for the presidency. But where did you go? My letters came back. When I phoned your home they said they didn't know where you were. Yes. I know. I made them promise that. Once I weakened and started to write you a letter. I never did finish it. And the later on, I .. I read about your marriage in the newspapers. Did .. Ginny tell you anything about her mother? No. She was a wonderful woman. We had a lot of things in common. That helped to balance the things we .. Didn't have. She. She died four years ago. Why did you feel you had to tell me that? I don't know exactly. I suppose I .. What are you trying to say, Jim? You came up here this weekend. Why? Don't you remember? You invited me. About that invitation. I carried it around for two years before I sent it. That was so silly, Jim. I answered it five minutes after I got it. Well, the weekend is saved. We found the film. Oh. I am sorry if I interrupted. - No. That's alright. Yes. I was just leaving. Miss Reed. Did I tell you it's wonderful to have you back? Yes you did, Dr Merrill. But it is good to hear it again. I'll see you this evening. Oh, Miss Woods. It's nice to have you here too. Thank you, Dr Merrill. The President is nice looking, isn't he? Yes, isn't he. You looked mighty cosy when I came out. Talking over old history exams? Hmm? You know what is wrong with you? You are so used to having your thumb in every Washington pie .. That you can't stand .. - I am filibustering. Alright, Woody. It is so. What is so? Just what you are thinking. Oh? Well, I suppose you have to do something to give the weekend a lift. It is more than that. He is the first man I ever loved. Maybe the only one. The truth is I'd marry him tomorrow if he would ask me. You are kidding, aren't you? What's the matter? You against marriage too? Of course not, but .. There's a time and place for everything. You are smack in the middle of an election campaign. And a hundred other things. Your life is too busy. There is quite a difference between a busy life and a full one. Listen, Agatha. When I was 14 I was madly in love a with a fellow who sold peanuts on our block. But I am not going to marry him. - Maybe you should. Maybe you have a deep and consuming need for peanuts. I am a little disappointed though. I thought you'd be happy for me. Well, what do you expect? I don't even know the guy. Well, I know him. This isn't just a whim, Woody. This is something I've thought about and waited on for twenty years. It may be the most important thing in my whole life. That is why I don't want anything to spoil it. That is why I don't .. What about that phone call? - Phone call? To Life, about Matt Cole. - Oh. Henry Luce. [ Telephone ] Yes? They tracked down Mr Luce. He is in Los Angeles. Get him. - They got him. Put him on, please. Hey, Miss Shackelford said I'd find Miss Reed in this building. Oh. You must be the photographer from Life? Darn it. This camera always gives me away. She's upstairs, third door on the right. - Thank you. He's cute. Mr Luce? Just a moment. Hello Henry? This is Agatha Reed. Yes. I have been trying to get you all afternoon. Thank you. "Hello, Agatha?" "Hello?" "Hello Agatha?" "Hello. Are you there, Agatha?" "Hello operator. Operator." "Yes, sir?" "Are we still connected?" "Yes, sir. Still connected." "Where the devil is everybody?" "Hello." "Hello, Agatha?" "Will someone please answer me or am I just talking to myself." "Agatha!. Hello. Hello!" Mr Luce. - "Yes." You will be delighted to know we are renewing our subscription. Memento? Yes. Sweet. What do you think you are doing? - My job. I am a photographer. You don't think I believe they picked you for an assignment like this, do you? No. As a matter of fact I asked for it. I got a great idea for a layout. The honorable Agatha Reed and how she grew. You will forgive me for being naive but I hardly think it was your only reason. May all my best shots be out of focus. Okay, Matt. But don't try anything else. I am warning you. - Yes, ma'am. This is my secretary, Miss Woods. How do you do. - How do you do. Now, if you will excuse me .. - Why, certainly. Now, would you mind directing me to the president's office? Why? Well, I am not officially here yet. I am meant to check in with the old codger. You will find the old codger in his office in the administration building. And where might that be? You know where it is, don't you Woody? - I think I do. Would you mind? I wouldn't want Mr Cole to get lost. If I do I'll send up a flare. Why was the honorable so upset about you coming up here? She thinks I'm in the employ of a foreign government. Come on, give. You're about as innocent as a rattlesnake. Alright. I'll tell you. I'm up here because I think she's on the verge of making a big mistake. What kind of mistake? For a man there is only kind of mistake a woman can make. Another man. - Why should that bother you? It shouldn't be hard for a smart girl like you to figure out. Oh, no. How long has this one been going on? 25 years? No. He has got a few years on her. Now I know who you are. You're up here to make trouble. That's who you are. But no fisticuffs when we get there. This is supposed to be a happy weekend. When we get there? Wait a minute. Don't tell me he is the president of this seminary? I thought you knew. - No. Thanks for telling me. You tricked me. Wild horses wouldn't have dragged that out of me. Forget it. What am I worried about? If I can't take her away from some old Mr Chips, I'll quit the business. Hello there. Hello. You must be Cole. - That's right. I'd heard you had arrived. I was just looking for you. Are you from the president's office? I am the president. I understand. Everybody expects some sort of Mr Chips character. I'm sorry. Well. If there's anything you want don't hesitate to ask me. Local color. Group pictures. That's fine. Thank you. That's fine. We've a reception tonight for Miss Reed. I'm sure you will want to cover that. Certainly. I'll be there. - Fine. Then I'll see you this evening. Miss Woods. Want to send up a flare? Is this the last movement? Claude, shush. Claude prefers Victor Herbert. Thank you. Well, I must say it tastes very good this year. Exceptionally good. You don't suppose Miss Shackelford increased the ratio? Professor Dingley. No. I suppose not. Thank you. Care for a cup, Mr Cole? - Yes. Thank you. Brandenburg concertos always give me a thirst. Do you have to endure this every year? - An occupational hazard. But I rather enjoyed it tonight. You mean it has been worse than this? No. What I really meant was I won't be hearing it again. Why? You are not graduating, are you? Good Hope and I will soon be going our separate ways. As a matter of fact I am almost looking forward to it. I haven't been exactly happy under the present management. Doctor Merrill? Oh no. I was referring to our illustrious chairman of the board. Mr Griswold. Doesn't the president have anything to say about it? Yes. Of course. But only if Mr Griswold has said it first. Excuse me, Dr Pitt. - My pleasure, Miss Birdshaw. It's so delightful I think I will have just one more cup. Cup. I do hope I am not coming down with a summer cold. Well, here is to Saturday mornings. Saturday mornings. What is with Saturday morning? That's when I shall be asked to resign. At ten o'clock or shortly thereafter. These old walls will shake with the bellowing of angry men. And within a few minutes of that time I shall take my departure in a .. Blaze of futile glory. You are not going to blow up the physics building as a farewell gesture? Not exactly. But there will be an explosion of a kind. What kind? Permit that to remain my secret, Mr Cole. Until Saturday. Until Saturday then. Not very stimulating, is it. You are wrong, Dr Pitt. I feel a noticeable lift. Agatha. There won't be many opportunities to be alone. There is so much I want to say. Well, we never encountered much traffic at the amphitheatre. That is true. The .. usual time? The usual time. Sorry if I startled you. The layout wouldn't be complete .. Without a picture of the president and his number one graduate. It might have been a better picture if you had given us a moment's warning. Mr Cole specialises in catching people off guard. Ah, you are both much too sensitive. You know, if this picture turns out as well as I think .. I'm going to go in business for myself. Family portraits. That kind of thing. Ah, there you are, Jim. Now look. I've worked on Jeff Barnes and he's just about ready to go for the new library. Now you give him the coup-de-gr?ce with a little pep talk. I'll talk to him in the morning, Claude. No, no. Do it now Jim, while he's rising to the bait. Dangerous to let him sleep on it. Come on. I will be alright, Jim. Thank you, Miss Reed. I'll introduce you to Barnes and then just slip away. Hmm. A heavy odour of orange blossoms in the air. You haven't wasted a minute, have you. No, no. Not a minute. He must be quite a guy to keep a woman like you on the hook for twenty years. Yes. He is quite a guy. Or else he must be getting tired. Now what does that mean? This overwhelming desire to return to the past. Girlhood memories, old pictures, old sofas, old sweethearts. Old hat. You have been on war fronts so long .. That a decent atmosphere is bound to seem a little incongruous. Who are you kidding? Why don't you take a look around? This afternoon I took some shots of the girls. How old are they? Nineteen or twenty? I found out what goes on in their little minds and what they know of the world. Europe is that way, Asia is that way. Very cute. Open your eyes, Aggie. This is a lost world up here. And Merrill is the perfect president for it. That penetrating analysis of Jim Merrill is based on one how-do-you-do. Is it? You used to be a good reporter once. Ask around. Talk to some of the teachers. Doctor Pitt for example. You might get an earful. Miss Reed. Yes, Ginny? Please forgive me Miss Reed but there is not much time. I told Dr Pitt that you asked to see him and he will be out here in a minute. Dr Pitt? I hope you don't mind, Miss Reed. I had to do it without asking you. He's in the library having an argument with Mr Griswold. I know what that is going to lead to. Would you pretend that you asked to see him? Yes. Of course. Thanks, Miss Reed. They've been trying to get him of here for a long time now. And it is so unfair. He is what all teachers should be. I understand. You tell him to come upstairs. I will be in my room. Miss Reed. Dr Pitt. Ginny said you wanted to see me. Yes. Yes, I did. Won't you come in. - Thank you. I have a feeling I am being saved. Well, I did want a chance to talk to you before the weekend was over. Why? For one thing because you told me my speech was wonderful. And another because you recommended my book to your students. Wouldn't you like to sit down, Dr Pitt? Thank you. I have always been curious. About .. what makes someone become a teacher. So have I. It must be that .. One day you decide the mind of a person is the most exciting thing in the world. Isn't that a little romantic? Maybe. But I think all of us who believe in the future .. Have to be a little romantic. I undertaking there is some question of your staying on here. Ginny seems to feel it is important that you do. Ginny is a nice girl. She has the eager and tense convictions of youth. Isn't that good? Not when you can't get to it. But you can. You are a teacher. And from what Ginny tells me a very good one. I teach physics, Miss Reed. Only sometimes I don't. Sometimes I talk about other things. The daily headlines. The situation in Asia. The United Nations. The growing threats to our own freedom. While we fight the lack of freedom elsewhere. You see. I have the dangerous misconception. That the object of education is to teach the young to think. You were making a point, Dr Pitt. Oh yes. A point. I am 45 years old, Miss Reed. For 22 of those years I fought every way I know against ignorance. Against indifference. Because I believe that people really wanted to learn. Well. I seem to have been wrong. The Griswolds don't agree. They are afraid of too much open and free discussion. So they, want me to resign unless I stick to the texts. Maybe they are right. And ignorance is bliss. If they don't care enough why should I? Let their daughters bring anything to classes. And read their trashy novels inside their notebook covers. Let them all be wiped off the face of the earth without even knowing why. Dr Pitt. I respect your fears. I am frightened myself. Anyone who isn't frightened today is a fool. But I never get angry at the fool. Only at the wise men who see the danger and run away. What would you have me do? First of all, stop feeling sorry for yourself. We all know there are men who are afraid to let education have a mind or a voice. You can get the support of the president and then make a real fight of it. Dr Merrill? Yes. Our eminent president long ago gave up battles in exchange for building. You don't believe me? No, I don't. - Why not? Because I know Jim Merrill. There is nothing more to say. You are going to leave Good Hope then? A muzzle is for animals, Miss Reed. I'm sorry I'm late. On my way here Dr Pitt stopped me. He wanted to talk to me about something you said to him. Yes, Jim. I have been thinking about that and I really had no right to meddle. In this case you had every right. What did you decide? I asked him to remain here. To go on teaching as usual. That is what you .. Expected isn't it? - That's what I hoped for. What about Claude Griswold? Well, I imagine there will be some tearing of hair at first. But I'm sure I can manage the situation so that both sides appear to win. Well Jim, that is wonderful. I didn't realize Pitt had made such an impression on you. No. It wasn't Dr Pitt. It was you, Jim. You had me scared for a moment. Did I? I thought you had gone over to the side of the educaterers. The what? Educaterers. Don't you remember? That is what you used to call educators with banquet sized manners. I remember. I also remember the last time we were here. We were very young. Very much in love. And you proposed to me. Right up there. Section "C". Row "B". 66 and 68. Agatha. If I were to ask you again. Is there any chance your answer might be the same? Always on a second proposal. You won't run away again? - No. Then I can tear this up. What's that? The note you left for me. When we were very young and very much in love. And you kept it? - Yes. Although I can never quite forgive myself .. For introducing you to the beauties of Walt Whitman. "Goodbye, My Fancy." "Farewell dear mate, dear love." "I am going away." "I know not where or to what fortune." "Or whether I may ever see you again." "So goodbye, my friend." "Hello, my fancy." Aggie. Well, hello. Oh. It's you. That is the answer I always get. Any idea where the honorable went? If this was West Point, I'd say Flirtation Walk. With the Commanding Officer. Going to wait? Well, I'll stick it out a couple of hours longer. If she doesn't show up by morning, I'll leave. You have kinda got it bad, haven't you. I'll write my biography someday and you can read it. Why should I read it when I can get it straight from the horse's mouth? What was it with you two anyway? Well, it didn't start out like much. First time I saw her she was up to her hips in a muddy bomb-hole in Yugoslavia. I thought she was a native and I took some pictures of her. That night the siege broke, she took a bat. And out came a brunette from the Detroit Herald. So you took a second look? - Yeah. She's the only reporter I know who can sit in a poker game, win the big pot .. And still have the guys wonder what she looks like over the toast and marmalade. Well come on. Don't leave me with my tongue hanging out. What happened? Look Cole, I am not being nosy. I think she is making a mistake too. I don't just work for this woman you know. I like her. I care what happens to her. So do I. I haven't seen her since the day Paris was liberated. The place was a madhouse. Men were weeping in the streets. Strangers were kissing like lovers. I was shooting pictures as fast as I could load my camera. Suddenly, there was right in the middle of my lens. I hadn't seen her in six months. It took us ten minutes to fight our way through the crowds to each other. My arms went around her and the crowds pushed us in a doorway of a barbershop. I can still smell the hair tonic. When I kissed her I knew I was going to ask her to marry me. I think she did too. We made a date for that night. I rustled up eight red roses, a bottle of vintage champagne and bought a ring. Then I went to my apartment and waited. I tore the petals off the roses and sprinkled them in the doorway. I put the ring in the bottom of the glass. The idea was that she would drink the champagne .. See the ring at the bottom and catch on that I was proposing. A nice idea, wasn't it? Yeah. Only she never got the idea or the drink. She just never showed up. Too bad. Well, the evening wasn't entirely wasted. I learned something that night that has been invaluable to me ever since. Do you know it only takes 3 hours for rose petals to go brown round the edges. I am sorry, Cole. - What are you sorry about? Now that I have seen her dreamboat in action I'm not worried. He is a memory. Something she has pressed in a book through the years. Like an old rose. Maybe you are right. But what is the good if she doesn't know it? She will. One thing about our Aggie. She is a realist. She can lie to herself just so much. She'll see him for what he is. You are expecting an awful lot of her in one short weekend. That's why I am giving her a little help. A little sleight of hand. Something I learned in Calcutta from an old Hindu fakir. You watch. A word here, a word there. Right before you very eyes I will turn that memory back into a man. Very clever if it works. It'll work. Well, I hope you are right. Anyway, thanks for the biography. Aggie. Well. I was just about to put a light in the window. I'm glad you didn't bother. I know where I am going. Do you? If I wasn't sure of it before I am now. Goodnight. - Just a second, Aggie. I want to talk to you. What can we possibly have to talk ..? Oh yes, of course. Doctor Pitt. Well, you see, Matt. I've discovered I am still a pretty good reporter. I didn't just ask around. I went straight to the people involved. Dr Pitt and Dr Merrill. Yeah? And any difference of opinion is now a thing of the past. Dr Pitt will remain at Good Hope. And go right on teaching in his own way. Well, there is one thing in the president's favor. He doesn't want to lose you and I don't blame him. But with men like Merrill it is a matter of horse trading. He will pay for that gesture. Before or after we are married? Then it is all set? All set. Just like that, huh? I see. Well, congratulations. I hope I've not annoyed you. I tried to tell you in Washington. - Yes. I know. But I had to find out for myself. You see, I thought we had something pretty wonderful together, Aggie. Worth putting up a fight for. But I can't fight against a dream and that is what you are hanging on to. I only hope you wake up before it is too late. My eyes are wide open. - Yeah? So are sleepwalkers. But you go ahead and bury yourself in this graveyard .. You just can't take, can you Matt? That he could be more exciting, more desirable than you. That is right. I'm as vain as the next guy. Since you go in for collecting memories, here is another one. Okay girls, take your places please. Remember now. The eyes and the teeth. Make 'em glisten. Okay, All together Cheesecake. Cheesecake. - Thank you. That will be all. Yeah, you looked great. Don't worry. Dr Pitt. Good morning, Mr Cole. - Morning, sir. I just remembered. I haven't taken a picture of you yet. Would you mind? Not at all. Where would you like it? Right over here would be fine. - Good. I hear .. I hear congratulations are in order. Well. For the time being. I thought it was all settled. Miss Reed said you were going to stay. Yes. But they might change their minds again. Really? Why? There is still Saturday morning. Oh, I had forgotten about Saturday. Tell me, is the explosion still on? Well. That remains to be seen. Come on, Dr Pitt. You can tell me. We are old punchbowl pals. Why don't you let me in on it? - I'm sorry Mr Cole, but .. That is still my secret. Good day. Mr Cole. May I see you for a moment, please? Certainly. Mr Cole, I have been looking everywhere for you. I had a wonderful idea. A series of photographs called "Room-mates". 1931 and 1951. Come again? - Well. Agatha Reed and Ellen Griswold. With Mary Nell and Ginny. - That is very touching. Now Miss Shackelford, tell me what happens Saturday morning at ten o'clock? Saturday morning at ten? Well now, let me see. Saturday. Ten o'clock. Oh yes. The film showing. - No. I don't mean that. Is something else cooking? Cooking? No, nothing. - But there must be. Mr Cole, I am in charge of everything. There will be nothing on Saturday at ten o'clock but Miss Reed's film. Miss Reed's film? - Command To The Future. She brought it all the way from Washington. Anybody seen it yet? - No. I don't think so but I am sure it is charming. It is better than that. Mr Griswold hasn't seen it either, huh? - No. I don't think anyone but Dr Pitt has seen it. It was his suggestion that we send for it. And now Mr Cole, about those photographs. You know .. - Oh yes. Yes, Miss Shackelford. You round up the victims and I'll meet you in front of Hope Hall in an hour. That will be fine. Isn't it exciting, Ag? I never thought I'd get my picture in Life. You stick around long enough honey, and Life is bound to catch up with you. Thanks. Now you'll tell me when, won't you Mr Cole? I always have to be told when. - Sure. I meant to ask you, Mrs Griswold. Did your husband get that matter settled with Dr Merrill? He's with him now. Oh, Ag. It seems Claude is a little worried about that movie of yours. Mr Cole was telling him something about it. Oh! You didn't say when. And I wasn't even trying to look nice. You know, I've got a theory about women, Mrs Griswold. I think they look their nicest when they are not trying. What were you saying about the movie? The movie? Oh, yes. The movie. I said to Mr Griswold it was one of the few I'd seen that really said something. I wished I had made it myself. Now, will today's children take the same positions please. Modesty and charm, girls. That's right, Mary Nell. Thank you, Ginny. Did I say something wrong? No, Ellie. But why should Claude be worried? Well, maybe worried isn't exactly the right word, Ag. It was just sort of a growl he gave really. Something about wanting to be sure it was right for our girls to see. Oh dear. I do hope there is nothing improper about the film. Maybe it is censorable. Well, don't everybody worry about it. Claude is taking it up with Jim now. Well. You couldn't ask for two better men to handle it. Now ladies. One for nostalgia. Modesty and charm. [ Telephone ] Shall I answer it? You have been so helpful to me today, Mr Cole. Please do. Hello. "Who is it? I want to speak to Miss Shackelford." Oh yes, we were just talking about you. "Yeah? Well, is she there?" Yes. One moment. Miss Shackelford. Thank you. Hello. - "Miss Shackelford?" Yes, Mr Griswold. Why, yes I did. Well. You see, sir. Well, sir. It is very difficult for me to .. Mr Griswold, will you please listen? I admit I wrote and asked for the object of our discussion. But it was Dr Pitt who told me that it was .. Yes, sir. I will arrange it as soon as I can. You will have to excuse me. - Certainly. I hope I haven't started any trouble. - Not at all. I am sure that Dr Merrill is quite capable of handling the situation. Fine. Otherwise I would have had this on my conscience. Dr Merrill. I hope there won't be any trouble. Trouble? I hear that Claude is a little concerned about that film of mine. Oh, a little. Of course, you reassured him? Well, I .. Had to admit I didn't know too much about it myself. Shall we take the other pictures, girls? - Yes, of course. Come along, girls. - Now, Mrs Griswold? What? Oh. Oh yes. Goodbye, Ag. See you later. Darling I am terribly sorry this happened. I forgot to ask you anything about the picture. When it came up I really didn't know what to say. Do you think I would have brought anything unsuitable? Of course not. Jim. I spent five years in Europe. I had a chance to see what happened in countries where freedom was destroyed. The first step was always the same. They began by putting a blanket over education. And by making it a crime for people to think. That is what the film is about. Actual newsreel shots of some dreadful things that have happened in our time. How they burned the books. And sent the scholars into slave-labor camps. How they hanged the teachers by their feet in a public square. Because they dared to teach the truth. Do you want to see that happen in this country? I'm not questioning it at all. It is just that .. These are touchy times so Claude feels we ought to have a look at it. Please don't be upset, darling. It's a shame Mr Cole had to bring it up but we'll straighten it out. In fact, I don't need to see the picture. I know it is alright. Besides, there is something the matter with my eyes anyway. I can't seem to see anything but you. You haven't forgotten there is a "steps sing" before the Prom? No. I haven't forgotten. I'll pick you up. Hello. - Hi. These just came for Miss Reed. - Thanks. Who is your date for the Prom, a full-back? No. He is a poet. But I am building him up. See you later. - Roger dodger. Why don't you try a little steam. I forgot to bring my tea kettle. Thanks. Here are the notes for your commencement speech if you want to look them over. Is something on your mind? Anything you want to tell me? No. But thanks anyway. Have you set the date yet? Look, Agatha. If you want to get married that is your business. I just want you to be happy. What makes you think I won't be? I am not saying you won't. I am just asking. After all you haven't seen this man in twenty years. Now all of a sudden in two days .. You still think I'm making a mistake, don't you. No. Not if you don't. Most mistakes you make you can feel. Well, I'll see if the .. What do you call it? The "steps sing". That's right. They sing on the steps. Is Miss Reed alone? - She was three second ago. Do you think she will see me? - Why not? Thanks. Come in. Ginny. Shouldn't you be getting dressed for the Prom? Miss Reed, is it a good picture? The one you brought down. Naturally, I think so. Well, would you call it dangerous? Well. If you set a match to it, it would burn. But otherwise no. Why? They are having a meeting about it at my father's house. What are you trying to tell me, Ginny? Some people think the college president has a right to make decisions on things. But he doesn't. He has to check everything with the trustees. Whatever he may feel himself, it doesn't matter. You mean they may not run the film? It is like I was telling you before, Miss Reed. Being president is different from just being a professor. You have more responsibility. So you have to make more concessions. Oh, he has done wonderful things for the school. Seven new buildings in ten years. He has been named the most successful administrator east of the Rockies. Isn't that something to be proud of? I am so proud I could .. It's alright, Ginny. It's alright. I am so ashamed. I've been ashamed for a long time now. If I could only get away from here. - What do you mean? Just get away from here. I don't know. Anywhere. Don't be silly, Ginny. You are graduating tomorrow. Why should I stand up there and let them hand me a diploma? When I know it doesn't mean anything. - That's not true. It is yours for what you have learned here. What have I learned? That my father is a coward? That he's so afraid of losing his job he has lost everything else he believed in. Oh, I have made apologies. I've made them until I can't look at him anymore. Maybe you are wrong about this. No. I am not wrong. As you left the house had they finished? Had they decided not to run the film? No, but .. Then how do you know he hasn't fought them on this? Because he has forgotten how to fight. Ginny. Sometimes a man needs a certain moment. Maybe this is it for him. Oh Miss Reed, you just don't understand. Ginny. I understand more than you think I do. I want to tell you something. Something I am sure you don't know. I was expelled from this college. Because I stayed out all night with a man. We were very much in love and planning to be married. But I ran away so I wouldn't .. Hurt his chances of .. Becoming President. Even at 18 I knew it was vital for a man like him to be a president of a college. Because he had great strength and integrity. And the courage of his convictions. And the ability to fight for them. I think your father remembers that today. And whatever has happened in between .. I think he would like to be that man again. So let's not turn away from him now just when needs us the most. I think I just grew up a little, Miss Reed. Did you, Ginny? Thanks to you. I should have known. Whenever he talked about you. He was different. I never really gave him up. I just needed someone else to believe in him too. You had better get dressed for the Prom. Now you take my word for it, Jim. Just keep working On Jeff Barns and he is bound to come through. He is loaded. Ellen, what are you doing? - I'm calling Ag. It is our signal. She's had too many Martinis. - Shall I get her? No, wait. I have a better idea. Now what is that for? You can buzz from here to the room. Ag and I always used it. If one of us had a blind date the other one always came down first. One buzz. He was short. Wear low heels. Two buzzes. He was tall. Wear high heels. I always said I would marry a 2-buzz. I've been called a lot of things in my life but never a 2-buzz. Now what are you up to? - You will find out. [ Radio music ] That is to set us up for the Prom. - Ellen. So the youngsters won't think we look so ancient. But we'll be dancing all evening. - Now don't be a killjoy, sweetie. Hello, Agatha. - Good evening. You look so beautiful tonight. Thank you. Oh. Bob and Ellen stopped by. They thought we might as well make it a foursome. Of course. Just like old times, isn't it, Ag? How do we stack up against the wolves of yesterday, Miss Reed? They had more hair. - But less money, eh Jim? Speak for yourself, Claude. Don't let him give you the impression that education doesn't pay, Miss Reed. I know. I sign his checks. Don't get embarrassed, Jim. It's worth every cent to have a president who can wear tails like that. Oh Ellen, I have had enough. I'm out of condition. Besides, I ate too fast tonight. - And whose fault is that? If you hadn't got upset at the movie you wouldn't have had to call a meeting. And if you hadn't .. Oh. That is too bad. It sounds like it?s all my fault. I didn't mean that, Ag. I just meant that .. How did you like the movie, Mr Griswold? Well, it is no Abbot and Costello. They are Claude's favorites. Agatha. Claude realizes what you are trying to accomplish. Sure I do. It's alright to make pictures like yours if you think they do any good. As long as .. - As long as nobody sees them. Turn that thing off, Ellen. Look, Miss Reed. I told you yesterday I am a great admirer of yours. So, let's not have any argument about this. I gave these kids a motion picture machine .. Because I thought they'd get a kick out of seeing pictures right here on campus. But why show them this kind of stuff? Let them enjoy themselves. Time enough to start worrying when they're out of college. Life is tough enough without drumming their heads full of problems. That's a very interesting theory of education, Mr Griswold. Is it yours? No. I leave the theories to experts like Jim here. I just know what I like and what I don't like. Then you don't like a film that makes a plea for academic freedom? Well, I don't .. - Mr Griswold. We're trying to sell the idea of freedom and democracy to the rest of the world. How can we succeed if we are afraid of it ourselves? I don't give a hoot about the rest of the world, Miss Reed. All I care about is protecting the minds of the young people here. And you are going to do that by restricting them from seeing a film .. That is considered educational. By preventing them from discussing any serious questions facing us today. That's not protecting them, Mr Griswold. That is destroying them. A college is where the future of the world begins. And professors aren't intellectual babysitters. It is there job to bring some light into this muddled world. But you have put a stop to that. The result is that the girls who graduate from this college tomorrow .. Aren't prepared for the world they will have to face. Yet you are content to hand it to them and say: "Fight for it. Die for it." "But don't understand it." Miss Reed. I can see why you start so much fireworks down there in congress. But here at Good Hope it all boils down to one thing. We know what is best for our school. Claude, please let me handle this. There is no handling to it, Jim. Let's stop beating around the bush. Miss Reed, I like to be frank. We have cancelled the showing of the film. There will be a statement. The schedule got overcrowded. I see. And the President? Did he agree? On vital issues. The President and the Trustees always agree. I'm sorry this had to happen, Miss Reed. Nothing personal in it at all. I hope it won't spoil an extremely pleasant weekend. Well. We had better be going. Claude, I would like to speak to Miss Reed alone. Alright. Only don't be too long. It wouldn't look well if you were too late. Come on, Ellen. Hello. Oh, excuse me. Have you seen Miss Reed? Yes. But I don't think you had better disturb her right now. Come on, Ellen. But you must give me a chance to explain. Jim. Did you see the film? - Yes. Did you think it was wrong for your students to see? Be honest with me. No. And you didn't stand up there and say that? Agatha, you are not being very objective about this. I realize how embarrassing it is for you to bring a film down here .. Could you possibly believe my vanity is concerned in this? I didn't say that. I am just asking you to try to see my position. I can't always bluster through my own opinions. There's times when I must bow to the .. - Claude? You are exaggerating Claude's importance in this whole affair. Am I? When he and not you seem to be the real judge of what's taught at this college. By what right? Do you respect him as an educator? He doesn't pretend to be that. He is a businessman. He gives money. He wants his say. It's as simple as that. Why do you look so shocked? Not shocked. Just frightened. That you can stand here and say that. And accept it. Good heavens, Agatha. I have to run this school. That means getting buildings, endowments. It's part of the job. So, I have learned to compromise. I give in on smaller issues here and there so I can win on the larger ones. And what are the larger issues? Suppose I'd fought Griswold on this to a showdown. It would be a heroic gesture and I would be out of here tomorrow. Would you? You used to love a fight like that. Things are quite different now. I have Ginny to think of. There is no need to lie to me. I have talked to her. And if you are not careful you are going to lose her. I don't know how important that is to you. But I suspect it is very important. What have you been telling her? Oh dreadful things. That you have courage. That you have integrity. And I didn't just say it, Jim. I believe it. Stand up to Griswold. Not for me. Not even for Ginny. But for yourself. Alright. I'm not going to plead with you anymore. No more appeals to your better nature. I know when I am beaten. I'm going to offer you a deal. A business deal. That is more in your line. What are you talking about? Just minutes ago I assured your daughter that you would run that film tomorrow. I don't like to think of her finding out you won't. So I am afraid you are going to do it. With or without Mr Griswold's consent. I'll leave procedure up to you. Is this your idea of a joke? - No. And in exchange for that small service. I will give you my personal guarantee .. That the Life article won't even hint at the colorful events leading up to my .. Expulsion from this seat of higher learning. I can't believe you would .. - Why not? You see, Jim. I am willing to take a chance on you. I know now that you are afraid. And with a man who is afraid it's just a question of the lesser of the two evils. Whether you risk being removed from here by running the film. Or whether you accept the certainty of being removed after this story breaks. You would really do a thing like this? You see, you learn all kinds of cute tricks in my work. The most important one being .. Never to play fair. Unless you respect the men you're dealing with. I never believed this could happen. Not after last night. Last night was twenty years ago. [ Choir singing ] The Alma Mater. Very appropriate, isn't it. Shall we go? Professor Dingley. I've been looking everywhere for you. Hurry. I've saved two seats for us in the last row. Thank you very much Miss Birdshaw. I was just examining the programme. Last two rows to the faculty. And remember girls, 'A' to 'M' on the left. 'N' to 'Z' on the right. Organisation please. Excuse me, Miss Shackelford. Good morning, Miss Woods. - Is Miss Reed inside? No. I haven't seen her. But she will be here, won't she? Yes. I think so. Hello. Good morning, Miss Shackelford. Why, you look radiant this morning. Is that a new dress? Yes as a matter of fact it is. - I nearly got you on the cover of Life. Come now, Mr Cole. You are pulling my leg. But it is a good idea. Say. It's sort-of a flexible program you run up here, isn't it? It is completely beyond me, Mr Cole. Everyone has been acting so strangely. Last night Dr Merrill tells me to cancel the film. And this morning he calls and says to go ahead. Dr Merrill ordered the film shown? Yes .. and then Mr Griswold called me up. And barked at me like a bear. As I told him. I said this is not my responsibility. I just do what the president tells me. Really, it has been extremely difficult for me. I shall certainly be glad when this weekend is over. I love that dame. Where is the honorable? The show is about to begin. She will be here. She has got the best attendance record in congress. Maybe she will send up a flare. Listen, Mr Cole. Merrill came through didn't he? You know what that does to your chances. - Yeah. Then what are you so happy about? I'm not happy. I'm sad. But you got to be philosophical about it. Something I learned from an old Hindu Fakir. Yeah. Is that the same brain who taught you to turn a memory into a man? What you want me to do, go around dragging my chin? The way it goes. Take the bad with the good. You're up, you're down. - You are punch-drunk. You coming in? - No. I've seen the picture. I think I will take one last happy look at Good Hope. I might run into an old friend. Well, good hunting. Beautiful morning, Dr Pitt. - Beautiful. You look tired. What are you doing here, Matt? Everybody has been looking for you. Haven't you heard the bells? They are showing your film. I know. Congratulations. What's the matter? Aren't you glad? Yes, of course. Well. It seems I was wrong about Merrill. Really Matt, there is no need to .. - Eat crow? I don't mind. I've no pride where you're concerned, Aggie. You should know that. I left it when I came to Good Hope. Of course, I did have the feeling that you might like having me around. We have been through all this. I thought maybe you had changed your mind. Why should I? - People do all the time. I saw it on the stage once. Where at the last minute the bride ran off with the best man. It was a big hit. Matt, leave me alone. Will you please. Do you mean you have got nothing to say to me? I thought we had said it all. Yeah, but I am stupid. I've got to have it all spelled out. He is a great guy. He's everything you ever hoped for and dreamed about all these years. And you will marry him. Is that it? I don't want to talk about it. Oh, you don't? Well, I do. If you don't mind I am going down to congratulate Dr Merrill. Matt. You couldn't face that, could you. Because you know it's a lie. You threw away six years we could have had together. Six wonderful, beautiful years. All because of a lie. But now you haven't got honesty enough to admit it. To me or to yourself. You have got to hang on to your precious ego. Well sister, you can have it. I am a big boy now. I got bigger and better things to do with my life. What are you doing? - I am leaving, Jim. I can't stay here and go through with this lie any longer. My speech is in the waste basket there where it belongs. If I had to stand up there and say it I'd choke on every word. Do you realize .. You can say I sent you a telegram, or I was ill, that I'm needed in Washington. Or something. Anything. Just like twenty years ago, isn't it, Agatha. Running away again. Jim. I was wrong last night. To expect you to be the same man I remembered. Nothing stays the same. And I was wrong to think I could help you win back your daughter. I can't blackmail you for the rest of your life. It is better that she knows the truth. Now, while she is young. Would you tell her that? If I had to, yes. [ Door Knocks ] Who is it? Ginny, Miss Reed. Come in, Ginny. I went to your office and they told me you had come here. We saw your picture, Miss Reed. It was wonderful. I wish you had been there, father. Some of the girls cried and some of them were shocked. They didn't all understand it. But I'm sure none of them will ever forget it. It was the best graduation present you could have given the senior class. And me. Thank you. I have to go now. All the girls are waiting for me. Ginny. - Yes? Miss Reed and I have been discussing something I think you should know. What is it? Ginny. Yesterday I told you that .. If you won't tell her, I will. Tell me what? You kissed me just now. You haven't done that in a long time. I am very grateful. But I cannot accept it under false pretences. False pretences? I had the movie shown but not for the reason you think. I did it because Miss Reed forced me to. Because she gave me an alternative that .. Left me no choice. That is the truth and I want you to know it. I don't any more lies between us. There have been too many already. I .. Haven't been much of a father for quite a while. I am sorry. Ginny, I didn't tell you this to hurt you. I've never meant to hurt you. You have forgotten a lot of things about me, haven't you. That I don't just cry when I am sad. That I cry just as much when I am happy. I don't care why you showed the film. I never wanted you to be a hero. I just wanted you to be honest. With me and with yourself. There you are, Jim. What is all this nonsense? Claude is terribly upset. He has been on the phone all morning. First when he heard about the movie. And then right out of the blue this resignation thing. Resignation? When did this happen? The letter came half an hour ago. I read it, Jim and it was so beautiful. Especially that part about self-respect. About you feeling like a .. Oh, what was it? It had something to do with eating. An educaterer? Why yes, Ag. How clever of you. Jim. Why did you do it? I stood at the back of the theater this morning and .. Watched them looking at the picture. Suddenly I realized I had almost not let them see it. That is when I knew that everything you said last night was true. That I had no right to be the president of this college. Or any college. Why, Ag. How could you say such a thing? I can't think of this college without Jim. And neither can the board. You should hear them shouting back there about the good you did for the school. About what a row the students would raise if they heard about it. Wouldn't they, Ginny? - They'd raise a heck of a row. I didn't resign as Alumni President. Thank you, Ellen. Hey, Ginny. Did you forget? It's commencement. Come on, Ginny. Hurry up. Okay. I always wondered why they called it commencement. Now I know. I'd better be leaving too. I am late already. But I just wanted to ask you to reconsider, Jim. Oh. You won't mention this to Claude, will you? That I came over. He will like thinking it was his own idea. It is very important for a Man like Claude, you know. To think everything is his own idea. I am afraid I have been underestimating you. You forget. I was in your history class too. See you later, Ag. I'm overwhelmed, Jim. I never expected this. We are even. Neither did I. Will you reconsider? I think it is very important to Good Hope that you stay on. When I came in here, I .. Wanted to tell you again. How much I love you. I didn't have much hope for it after last night. But that somehow .. today .. I know we are different people than we were twenty years ago. I know that a lot of things have changed. But I wouldn't want to go through the rest of my life thinking I hadn't tried. Do I have a chance? You might have had a very good chance, Jim. Except that. Well, you see .. we only met today. Just now really. And as .. someone who has a few years start on you. He is lucky. Thank you, Jim. You will stay, won't you? For commencement, I mean. Yes. I'll stay. Thank you, Agatha. Hello. Well, where have you been? - Where have I been? I've been out with the bloodhounds. Where have you been? Straightening out my life. Well, now I know. You want to get into your cap and gown? Yes please, Woody. Here you are. - Thanks. What arrangements did you make for getting us out of here? Getting us out? They tell me there is a plane leaving at 06:55. You better call old man Wister right now. Tell him to set up the committee meeting first thing in the morning. And call Senator McIlroy and tell him he was right. I will make a swing through the whole state before the election. And close your mouth. You look like a fish. But I thought you and Merrill .. - That's your trouble, Woody. You think too much. You're so busy figuring out things ahead that you are always miles behind. You get on the phone about the plane tickets. I've got to change my shoes. Yep. That's my trouble alright. I think too much. Hello. This is Miss Woods. Would you get me the airport please. Where is the honorable? Look. Would mind telling me something? What is going on? Merrill runs the film. You are philosophical. She straightens out her life. I don't get it. You will. You know, I can't keep this thing on. Well. I thought you'd departed to bigger and better things. I've some news for you. - Hello? Leave us alone. - But .. I said leave us alone. I'll call you later. You are not going to do it. - Do what? You are the stubbornest woman I ever saw in my life. You're so stubborn you will go ahead and marry him. But you will not do so. Really? - Now look. Let's get one thing straight. I am not asking you to fall into my arms. I wouldn't even catch you if you did. One thing I found out this weekend. I don't like women. Then, why all the bother? Because I am neat. I straighten pictures. I put the tops on toothpaste tube. I don't like unfinished things lying around. You'll not go through with this and throw away your life. Aren't you being a little overconfident? I don't think so. I am offering you a deal. A business deal. And in exchange for such a small service I am giving you my personal guarantee .. That the Life article won't even hint at the colorful events .. Leading up to your expulsion from this seat of higher learning. Why, you .. See pictures on preceding page. So, you're an eavesdropper too among your other accomplishments. Sure. You learn a lot of cute tricks in my work too. Are you sure there is no longer anything personal in this? Never mind that. We've got a deal cooking. Well. It seems I have no other choice. Have I. Woody. There has been a change of plans. We are leaving Good Hope today. We'll catch the 06:55 plane. You better call old man Wister .. And tell him to set up a committee meeting first thing in the morning. And call Senator McIlroy. Tell him I'll make a swing through the state before the election. But you just told me .. - I know. But there has been a change of plans. Oh. A change of plans? Miss Reed. Miss Reed. Ready, Miss Reed? - We are your honor guard. Everything is on schedule. We're meant to leave here as soon as the bell starts. Thank you. I am honored. There they go. Well. I am ready. Your speech. Have you got your speech? My speech? Oh .. I left it on the desk. What did you do with it? I never touched it. I must have left it in the .. Oh. We had no file. Yes, that's right. Come on, let's go. One weekend. Can a woman go crazy in one weekend? What is so crazy about changing her mind? Changing her mind? She told me the same thing five minutes ago. She what? What do they put in the food around here anyway? Now, what's got in to you? Sweetheart, don't try to understand it. Just relax and enjoy it. What kept you? You. You politician. 0h, Matt. You were right. We have missed six wonderful exciting years. I have been so blind. Why didn't you make me see? Why didn't I make you see? I .. -(s-d-)
