Thank you, Marcello but I don't feel like it. No, that kind of thing doesn't do it for me. Yes, with Lala, go figure. No, I'd rather spend the weekend at the seaside. That's ok, I don't mind getting bored. And it will make my wife happy. Oh, Riccioni is here! Excuse me, I'll call you when I get back. Ok, Miss, I'm hanging up. Goodbye, Marcello. Hello? Baltic Hotel? I'm the engineer Marletti, I would like to speak to my wife. Thanks. Oh, no, no, it doesn't matter. When she wakes up, please tell her that her husband will arrive in the morning. Her husband. Very well, thank you. Goodbye. I'm coming, I'm coming. Please, let me pass, thank you. Move! - Why are you saying that to me? Go bother those guys from Milan! - Move, get back! Step aside, please. Excuse me, where's the Baltic? Hotel Baltic. Go straight ahead and at the end of the street turn right. - Thank you. Please. Excuse me. Excuse me. Please buy some sheets from me, sir. Hello, sir. - Marletti, which number is it? 224, on the second floor. The lady is on her room. They're hand-embroidered. Look at them... A perfect gift for your fiancé. - I'm married, sister. Be quiet! We're in an elevator. Behave! Stop, stop! What's wrong with you? Giuggi? Giuliana? - Who is it? It's me, Enrico. Hi, love! - Honey, I'm home. I'm coming out. - Come on, I want to see you. Come on, come on! Giuggiolina, come here. Giuggi, I've brought you a little present! Thanks, leave it over there. - Ok. Giuliana, what did you do? You bought those sheets? No, it's nothing. I've bought them from some nuns, for charity. I just couldn't say no to them. Don't be mad at me, will you? I know they're ugly. Well, yes. - Enrico! What? - What did you bring me? A pretty thing, a surprise. Is it big? Pretty much, yes! Giuggi? Come on, get out. - Just a second, darling. Come on, we're at the seaside and you take a bath in the tub? Come on, open up. Here I am, you silly man. No, no, let me go, I've got to go to the hairdresser's. I don't care. - I'll miss my turn. Why do you always think of the same thing each time you see me? Well of course I do. I've been thinking about it for three weeks. Please don't punish me, Miss, I have been a good boy. Where's my little present? - Over there. One, two, three, four and five. Thank you, pumpkin. Thank you. No. Meanwhile, I will put these out of your reach. I'm going to the hairdresser's. Get ready and then come and join me. Marletti, nice to meet you. Very well, thank you. Shit. Well. Not bad. - Sir. - Yes? Your luggage Yes, that's right. The luggage. It's mine, leave it over there. And listen, you should knock before you enter. Yes, I did that. Ok. Thank you. Excuse me, may I? - Go ahead, please. Excuse me. - Please. Giuliana, will it take you long? What? - Yes, the whole day. Couldn't you have done this yesterday? If you want, you can go and wait at the lobby or at the bar. You're so vain. Hi, Giuliana. - Hi. I'm going to the beach. Should I get something for you? - Yes, my husband. Clelia, this is Enrico. She's Ms. Valdamieri. Nice to meet you, Marletti. - Let me look at you. What a handsome husband you have! I try my best. You're coming with me? - With pleasure. Be careful with the sun, please put sunscreen on. Yes, I'll put it on, don't worry. - I'll be there in an hour. Ok. This is my daughter. - How pretty! How are you, sweetheart? But don't you know you should kiss a lady's hand? "Madame, enchanté" - Delightful! And don't wear that awfully short swimsuit that you bought recently. Let's go. - I'm coming! Let's go, the beach is empty at this time. ...and since then, we don't talk to the people from under that umbrella. Do you agree? - Yes, of course. Absolutely. There are some lines one shouldn't cross. Just a slip of the tongue and everybody on the beach knows about it. Well, excuse me, but don't tell me that's friendship. You don't think so? - Well, yes. Sure. On the other hand, Giuliana and me, we get along perfectly. Because we both can't stand gossip. We keep things to ourselves. - Sure. The less people you know, the better off you are. That's what I say. Hi, Gustavo! This is Mr. Marletti. - Please. My husband. Nice to meet you. And the girl? She must be in the water, playing with Ms. Liberati's kids. I'll go get her. - Go, go. He's not going to get the girl. He's going to look at the young ladies. One of these days he'll get a heart attack. Hello. - Hello. These two aren't really married, but they go around saying they were. He separated from a certain Elena Saetti, from Milan. He married her during the time of the Republic of Salт. Yes. - That's a German called Hildegard. She once had her passport taken away for currency trading. Go figure. And he's a soldier from Perugia... ...who never takes off his shirt. Do you know why? Because he got the Duce's head tattooed right on his chest. Hi, Giuliana. Hi. Hello. - Hello. I know of much more things... ...but I won't tell you because I don't like to gossip. What's up, my little cue ball? You won't sunbathe? I was just sitting here listening to the lady. Hey, Clelia. You look good with that hair color Filippo did for you. I might change my color myself. What's wrong? You look tired. Me? I'm perfectly fine. When did you come back yesterday? - At three. How was it? - It sucked. Good thing I left early, then. You look beautiful. Your tan looks great. Oh please, I'm having a headache. It seems like headaches make you look radiant. Oh, don't tease me. Clelia, listen. I really should change rooms with that flagrant girl next door. I can't fall asleep. Every night she brings along a new one. I can't believe it. All right, we're living in a democracy now, ...so everyone can do as he pleases, ...but your neighbor's sleep should be respected, right? The love bee must have stung her. Pretty, eh? You like her? No, she's too thin. Good morning, sleepyheads. - Good morning. He's Giuliana's husband. Mrs. Ferrari. Nice to meet you. - Hello. And Count Bellanca. - Marletti. Nice to meet you. Pellini, nice to meet you. Where are the others? - They must be sleeping. Here's Pasqualino. Good morning. Hey, Pasqualino. Giuliana's husband has arrived. Marletti. - Pleased to meet you. What a guy! Very nice. Here I am. Giuliana, is your sewing work making progress? Turn around. You're missing just an inch. Because of something similar, Hitler lost the battle against England. I'm going back to work. Excuse me. And since when do you read Pablo Neruda? Why? Can't I read Neruda? Sure, but it's the first time I've seen you read poetry. What do you mean? You see me reading it now. Here. Hello everyone. - Hi, Isabella. This is my husband. Miss Dominici. Marletti, pleased to meet you. - The pleasure is mine. What a cute hubby you have! I'm going for a swim. Are you coming along? - Sure. We'll go later. Go, we'll join you later. What did you say her name was? Isabella Dominici. Careful, that Isabella flirts with everybody. Oh, well, I'm not afraid of her. As long as you got your Pablo Neruda. Enrico, please stop mocking me just this once, will you? Hello, everyone. Hi, hi, hi. - Good morning. Clelia. - Hi. Giuliana, are you coming? - With pleasure. Who are you, her partner? - Yes, hello. Are you also going for a swim? - No, he's not the type. Goodbye, everyone. Why? Where are they headed? They're going for some water skiing. But don't worry. Pierino is a little bit... Really? I hadn't noticed. Come on, guys. Let's go diving. - Yes, yes. Come on, you too, let's go. - Quick. Let's go. Do you know the gentlemen? No, I haven't had the pleasure yet. - Then let me introduce you. My wife. Nice to meet you. - Hi, I'm Marletti. Doctor Risi. - Hello. Marletti. - Dr. De Rossi. Pleased to meet you. And let me introduce Professor Ferri. Ferri, this is Mr. Marletti. Marletti. - Pleased to meet you. You come from the south, don't you? Yes. Something like that. I've been teaching Latin at a high school, for ten years now. You're lucky: you don't need to travel for five hours and wet your feet. You think? Two month of paradise, and the rest of the year it's hell. Look, look. Look at this beautiful Nordic one. Here, here. Look, look. Two delicate flowers who have just blossomed. Beautiful! Such a temptation. Fall will come and with it the saddening solitude of the classroom. 35 teenagers with fresh hair on their legs. Please excuse me, engineer. - Please. Lotte! Lotte! Hey, Lotte! Lotte! Help, a shark! There's a shark! Take this, you filthy shark! The hand, my hand! Momma, call a surgeon! You don't know how to swim, do you? Enrico! What? Enrico, come on! Come on, the auction starts at 1 o'clock. What auction? - Come on. Hello. At your service. Enrico! Brandy! Brandy! Excuse me, sir, have you seen a very small red dog? It's called Brandy. I've lost it, and... I'm new here. Maybe over there. - Thank you. Brandy! Excuse me, have you seen a red doggie? What is this? It's Celentano, he's singing on Saturday afternoon. Enrico! Are you ready? - Yes. Hurry up. Don't you have to go to that ball at the embassy? Yes, I'm ready. Come on. Come on, hurry up. - Yes, yes. Listen, love. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Leave me alone! We could be seen. Mr. Marletti? Yes. Your wife doesn't love you anymore. Come on, stop goofing around. - She doesn't love me anymore. Stop talking nonsense. Does love only mean that for you? Yes. Few feet have walked on this carpet throughout its three... ...centuries of existence. As you can see, it's still in perfect shape. It's almost like new. The initial price for this... ...persian carpet of rare beauty... ...has been fixed at a mere 100.000 lire. Why have we even come here? Why don't we just leave? Stop it, we've only just arrived. Does anyone bid more than 100.000? Take it away. That turkish carpet was a real bargain. Turkish? Those rugs were made in Busto Arsizio. It's all right for tourists. Count Bellanca has an art gallery in Turin. And he knows a lot about art. Ok, one of these days we'll make a little trip to Turin... ...but I'm not spending a single lira on this auction. Have I made myself clear enough? It's embarrassing, we'll be the only ones not buying anything. Are you Mrs. Scrooge McDuck? Show it to the gentlemen. Don't tell me this one isn't lovely! Don't talk nonsense. It's not about the money. It's about not behaving like fools. No, no. Gentlemen, I repeat, this is a real bargain. 80.000 lire. 90.000! 90.000 lire! 90 going once, going twice... ...sold! Sold to the gentleman, thank you. They found a fool. The age of this vase remains unknown. Some say it's from the 18th century... ...while others think it's from the 17th. Did you know that Chinese vases bring bad luck? Enrico, don't tell me you're superstitious. Sir. Yes? - I'll send it to the hotel. No, thanks. It could break. We don't even know where we should put it at home. Your husband is very likeable. Let me buy you a drink. I couldn't possibly go with this thing. Besides, I'm hungry. See you. - See you. See you, Bellanca. - Goodbye. By the way, I've almost finished Neruda. And what do you think? Tell me honestly. I thought it was very interesting. But... However... How should I put it? Some images are a bit disappointing. Your judgment is always so precise, Giuliana. No doubt about it, at some point the images drop. Giuliana! Yes? - Come, I'm hungry. Goodbye. - We'll talk about it again. I'm interested. Thank you, with pleasure. Close it, Toni. Is everybody in this hotel this dense? I said I wanted my pasta without sauce... ...and al dente. And you bring it seasoned and soft. Besides, the wine is burning hot. Isn't there at least some ice? - Should I bring you a new one? No, you need twenty minutes to make them. What fish do you have? - We don't have fish. No fish? We're at the seaside. Well... Then what do you have? There's Vitello tonnato, or, I don't know, stuffed eggplants. So, just leftovers? Please, Enrico, don't raise your voice. Everybody's looking at us. At any rate, you don't get to the beach to eat. Yes, I do, and I don't plan to set any fasting record. I recommend polpettone. So it really is leftover day, right? I will have the eggplants. - Yeah, bring them to her. Hi Giuliana. - Hi. This is my husband. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - My pleasure. And the general. - Morletti. It's a pleasure. Profesor Ferri, let me introduce my husband. Ferri. Didn't we meet at the beach? - Yes, sure. This morning you were in a hurry. Hi! - Hello, darling. How are you? - Please. Giuliana, you know you got a most handsome husband? You were keeping him a secret! Thanks, but not all that glitters is gold. Excuse me, sir. - Yes. Giovagnoli.. - Nice to meet you. Enjoy your meal. - Goodbye. Hello. - Hello. Hello. Hello, darling. - Please. Don't think much of it, she blinks at everyone. She believes that's how one greets people in Italy. Thank you. You might be an exceptional person and live by intellect alone. Thank God, I'm a common man, of flesh and bone. And I didn't eat stuffed eggplants since 1945. Therefore I'm leaving. I'm going to find a restaurant and and catch up with you later. No, Enrico, please don't. What, what's wrong? Nothing, nothing, nothing. What are you doing? You're going to cry? You see, Gustavo? A family quarrel. Inés! You're being hysterical. Ok, now we should eat and then... Oh, no, I'll take you to Rome. You have to restore your health. Afterall, they're not that bad. Look, look, look! Mrs. Marini. Sir, you know who is that young man with the dark glasses? A private investigator hired by the jealous husband. Bon appétit! The rehearsals are at 2 o'clock. Clelia, you must be there. Bye. - Yes. Giuliana, the rehearsals start at 2 o'clock. Please, come. You too, sir. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Isabella, please pay attention, you're distracting Giuliana. Smile. One, two, three, four. Pasqualino, you should also smile. One, two, three, four.. How beautiful you are! I'm tired. I'm going to take five minutes of rest. All right, Clelia. A true artist. Splendid. - Thanks. My feet really hurt. What kind of clownery is that? It's no clownery. It's very serious. They collect money for the orphans who have to spend the summer in shelters. For the orphans? Good. Who is this beauty? The second one. What? The second one on the left, that cannon. But that's your wife, engineer. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. What a drag! Guiliana, enough. I can't stand it any longer. Doesn't your husband know what to do? But no! He's like the great artists. - Come on. Let's go, you should also do something. Come on. - Come on, go ahead. Dance! Yes, he can dance. If only. - With the feathers. But what are you thinking? The back, the back. - Down, down, down. Come on. - There. Giuliana. Yes, come on. Sentimental. How beautiful is life. That's it. Poor orphans... You're really good at it, you know? Come on, girls. No more kidding. Giuliana. Now me, now me. Do you have kids? - No. Why? Aren't you able to have any? Well, I can have children, but then I eat them. Please. You're finally back? How do you put up with this daily routine? Aren't you tired? - Well, no. No? You know I didn't recognize you earlier on? You were really great. But you're more beautiful like this. I prefer it. Dear, in this heat! Besides, I haven't slept a wink last night. But weren't you asleep when I called you? I don't think so. I had just returned to the hotel. From where? We were all dancing at La Sansara. We were all laughing about Pasqualino. Who is Pasqualino? That jerk with his jokes? I can't stand your mania to badmouth people you don't actually know. Pasqualino is really fun, he's a good dancer and has obtained two degrees. Sure, he came up with them just like that. Giuliana! Giuliana! Giuliana! Who is it? I don't know. - Isn't he calling for you? Maybe another Giuliana. Tell me, Giuliana. What's the matter with you? Nothing. I already told you. It's nothing. Is it really nothing? Perhaps a bit of melancholy. - But why? I don't know, Enrico. It's something strange. Like... Like...? Like feeling the sand of time running through my fingers. Now take a rest. What are you doing? Nothing, the car just needs a check-up. I make use of this opportunity. I'll be back soon. Do you need anything? No. Where are you going? Will you give us a ride? What are talking about? A ride? Come on. Get out. Get out. Come on, all of you. You, too. Get out. Here. Whose is this? But isn't there a mother around? You had a fight with your wife, right? Go away. Icecream Motta and Mottarelli. Try the icecream Motta, it's the best. Icecream Motta. What would you like? - A Cinzano. A bit of Seltz? - No, no. And when did she call? At 2 pm. Did you tell her I'm dead? Yes, but she didn't believe me. She wants to know the name of the cemetery and the number of the grave. Why don't you take her? I can't. You know I can't Impose her on him. Excuse me? Sergio got a girl he needs to get rid of. Would you like her? Are you into girls? Well, I'd say yes. Why? Do you know anything better? There! 1000 lire. We made a bet and he won. Excuse me? My friend said that you were a... I said you weren't. Do you understand? But how do you come up with something like that? What do you want? You're following me for half an hour and that's why I thought... I was mistaken. That could happen to anyone. I'm sorry. And you're probably married. Yes, I have a wife. We're on vacation. A jealous husband? No. A bored husband, I'd say. You were wrong, give him back the the 1000 lire. Can I invite you to a drink? Yes, thanks. - You're welcome. Bring me a small beer. - Coming soon. My name is Sergio. And I'm Enrico. Pleased to meet you. As for this one, I rather won't present him to you. - And how many girls do you have? - Seven or eight. - I'm going out with four from there. - Yes. A tiresome job. Sometimes it also got benefits. And you're one of those who work a lot? During high season I get up to 70 or 80. You maintain a good average, right? And are these generally beautiful girls? Not all of them are beautiful. Some are quite difficult to desire. But one has to fly the flag. Do you prefer foreign girls? Yes, generally speaking. Especially the Danish girls. They're the best. The German girls are very sentimental. The American girls aren't my cup of tea. But I don't mind them either. What are you preparing? A cocktail I invented. It revitalizes you. "Mandrilo drink" And...? - Yes, would you like some? No, no, yo no... Thanks. I recommend it: milk, some eggs, vitamins, nutmeg and some spice. And the Italian girls? How are they? Tecnically they got no deficits. But as far as I'm concerned, they're not in the same league as the French girls. That's a personal opinion. Yes, of course. - I haven't met any that surpasses them. I met a really strange one. She had some kind of tic. Tic, tic! Was it a lady? Of course. She was always waiting for her husband to arrive. And don't you feel sorry for the poor husbands. You don't... You see, can I address you informally. - Yes, go ahead. I don't feel sorry for the husbands. Noone gets off scot-free. - Noone? - Noone. And how is this summer going so far? Not bad, even though it's just the beginning. But so far I can't complain. The Grand Hotel gets frequented a lot. Not to mention the Regina. At the Regina you can always fish for a desperate woman. And at the Hotel Baltic, are there also desperate women? A bit of everything. Nothing special. I'm acquainted with one who resides at the Baltic. I met her a little while ago. - What's her name? Her name is... Bah, I don't remember. Giuliana, yes. I'm not that keen on seeing her. She isn't ashamed of anything. Her poor husband is working throughout the year to pay for her vacation. And as soon as she arrives: Here we go! Let's have fun! Yuck! Sergio! Sergio! That's her, it's Giuliana. Do you know how old she is? Twenty. And she's been married for two years. Is that possible? - Sergio! Let's go. I'm coming! - Get a move on! See you, Enrico. Sorry for bothering. But no. Excuse me, but I have to... She is Giuliana. Marletti. - Giuliana, my pleasure. How about going out together one of these nights? Yes, why not? Together with your wife, of course. I'm up for it. We'll see. Bye. - Bye. Goodbye. - See you, Madam. Goodbye, Enrico. - Goodbye. Giuliana, there comes your husband. Enrico, where have you been? Come on, get on. Enrico, where are you going? Come with me. - Here, get on. Here, with me. Right ahead, champions. Professor, where are we going? To a soccer match. Married men vs. Bachelors. You're going to be my adversary. Excuse me. - And please pedal, don't just pretend. Attention. To the left, team. The bachelors lead with 17:9. Right now Marletti controls the ball. Come on, pass it over! Come on, Gustavo! Pass it over! Hand, hand! Penalty Referee, hand, penalty! Penalty, I kick it. - Which hand, which penalty? It wasn't on purpose. The referee is a corrupt prick! Yes, yes, a prick. Yes, yes. Whistle, whistle. Marletti will take the penalty kick... ...after having kicked already seven for the team of the married men. Professor. Pay attention to this one. One moment. - What? All right, put them on. I know, but he's not ready. Attention, professor. A foul with the goalkeeper. Dangerous play. Do what I tell you. Yes, no, to the sideline. Very quick play by both teams. What do you mean by foul? I didn't touch it! Referee! One moment, one moment. The picture. Very good play by the married men who are now pressuring a lot. The picture, the picture. There, let's go. Goal! There, bachelors! Bravo! Giuliana! Come on, pass me the ball. I got it. Take this, professor. Here, pass it to me! How was the game? Why, wasn't it good? Stop talking about the game. Let's talk about something else. It was a hand as big as a house. Enrico, does your leg still hurt? No, no. Do you want to see a doctor? - No, no, I'm fine. I know. You're again playing the victim. All right, I get myself a bed in the hospital. Are you happy now? Do you think there is life on the planet Mars? Well, there certainly is, each Saturday night. A good one, but I already heard it. And what's it with you? With me? Nothing, why? I know you quite well. Is anything the matter, Giuliana? Or am I mistaken? Well, there's nothing. What should there be? Pasqualino. - Yes? Come here. Tell them to stop this German music. The should play "The World". And if I handle this, what will you give me? A kiss. Not now, my husband is here. Later. - Later. This music drives me crazy. Giuliana. I've chosen a few verses for you. I think it's a good image. Read them camly. - "And here..." - Can I also read them... ...or am I too stupid? They're by Dylan Thomas, the great English poet. Yes. "And here... - Good evening! - "...that night, discovering your chants... - ...the hell and heaven of love..." - Giuliana. Giugi! It's almost 9 pm. Let's go. Well, guys! Enrico and I will go back to the hotel to change. See you! - Bye! - Bye! - Bye, everyone. - Pitching the tent! - Bye, Giuliana. - Good night. Please collect everyone's tips, professor. Isabella, what are we going to do tonight? Tonight we'll neither have dinner nor will we sleep. Tonight is tango-time! Well thought, you're absolutely right. Very well, my little cat. She's turning into a real housewife. It's no easy job to educate these girls. Thanks for inviting me to a dance. You're welcome, Madam. Though actually I invited you to have diner at our hotel. I'm so keen on being with you. But aren't you with me? Did he do it because his wife had been unfaithful? Not to even think about it. Today noone would kill for having been betrayed. He had a debt of 600 millions. Poor Cessano! Do you remember we were in Portofino with him a year ago? As if it were yesterday. Which Cessano, the textile manufacturer? Yes, I think that's him. - He was a noble and generous soul. - Having a noble soul and founding hospitals isn't the best way to confront economic problems. I can assure you that I almost envy guys like Farida and Maresotti who spent all their money on women and then said: "Goodbye, that's it!" At least, while ruining themselves, they weren't foolish and knew how to live well. - How will this poor Italy end up? - Well, let's skip that. Enough of grief, let's live up! As our friend Mike uses to say: - Happiness, happiness! - Happiness! Everything is getting lost, dear Porretti. Marletti! And do you know what's most of all getting lost? Personal satisfation. We feel obliged to pretend, so that everyone thinks we're beautiful, healty, strong and wealthy. You're actually right! A little while ago the chief of the accountants' department at my office had a heart attack and didn't tell anyone out of fear he might get replaced. He said that he only had a flu, and each morning, at 8 o'clock he was there, rather dead than alive. - That's how the world is, my friend. - What can one do? - Yes, but in the end one should be able to cure after suffering a heart attack without having to be afraid to lose the job. You're a bit of a communist, if I'm not mistaken, my dear Mr. Porretti? - Marletti, Sir, Marletti. - Ah, yes. I can no longer look at the sea. It frightens me terribly. I don't know how to swim. Just by looking at a wave my stomach turns upside down. But I feel obliged to spend three months of the year on this boat and to present myself in front of the whole Mediterranean like a catwalk model. - Today here, tomorrow there... - Yes. To exchange confidences, I also hate the sea. I can't await the hour... You? You're lucky to be a mediocre man. The public opinion ignores a Porretti. Lucky you. But when I disregard a port control, just once, on the next day the whole administration board will be talking about it. "Tagliaferri has financial problems, he needs to reduce his spendings." "He's almost ruined". And soon after that, panic strikes. You understand? I'm sick of the sea! And also of women, whom one should approach cautiously at my age. No! - Yes! But I'm only asking for one girlfriend, you understand? Dear Tagliaferri, it's a real disgrace to be rich in our times. Today the rich man is really poor... - You just uttered a big truth. Yes, because a... - Let's see, where is the shirtsleeve? - I assure you we had a wonderful conversation. - Thank you. Really, you're very likeable. Take a seat. I will think of you if one day I should need a honorabe person for my company. What? Amen. Give me some. Drink. - Thanks. Well, tomorrow, more or less at noon I'll be off to Venice. What a malodorous city! Wait, I'll cover you. Good, my friend. Now let me sleep. Good night! - That's it. - What are you doing? - Excuse me. - And turn off the light! - Like that. Right. - Sleep well, eh? - Give me a kiss. Excuse me. - The light. - Good night. Enrico. - I'm going to the kitchen. Will you help me? - I'm sorry, but I'm busy. Oh, mit dear engineer. Get up. Don't touch me! Don't talk to me anymore! This boat dances more than we do. "The honest women are desolate because of the mistakes they didn't make." Sasha Guitry. And what does yours say? "The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it". Oscar Wilde. "You lose what you abandon." Enrico Marletti. Engineer and thinker. Up! Up! Come on, engineer! Give us a hand. You should also pull! Up! For me, too. For me, make it two. Two. I like fish. How good it smells! - I'm going to eat them all up till the fishbone! Enrico, pumpkin, eat some fish! What fish? - But why "what fish"? This one! - Pasquallino, Isabella. - Serve us one. Engineer, would you like some wine? Is there wine, wine? Thanks. - Who wants wine? Here, Isabella, here! That's a great wine. Splendid. Ah, guys, the sun! The sun is coming out! The sun rises at the break of dawn. The spectacle has finished. Icecream, roasted almonds. Guys, it's late. We should return. Good night. - Come on. What are we going to do today? - How about tomorrow? Everybody should think of something and later we discuss it. Or we could create a virus. - Yes, lots of them, right? Enrico! Enrico, everybody is leaving. Get up! I'm tired! Wake up, we're leaving. - Where to? Getting to sleep. Stay on your side. How is it possible you won't stop moving around throughout the entire night? What night? It's 8 o'clock in the morning. And I can't sleep with sunlight entering. Give it a try. Stay with your eyes closed for five minutes. I've been staying with my eyes closed for hours, and I'm getting really nervous if I can't sleep. - All right, then do as you like. Of course I will, I've always done as I liked. Eh! Did you remember to turn off the water, the light and the gas in Rome? No, I left it all open! Mister, mister. Listen, did you see a little red dog around here? No, I haven't seen anything, Madam. - It's my dog. I haven't seen anything. I've been sleeping. - No, haven't seen anything. These people... They never see anything. What are they doing here? Brandy! Brandy! Mussels! Mussels! Fresh mussels! Mussels! Mussels! - Neapolitans! Neapolitans! Cream biscuits! I'm going! Cream biscuits! Attention, please. We're searching for a six year old boy, he is called Carlo. He is blonde and wears a cap with white and red rays. On Saturday the 22th some black people from Madagascar will be acting in the Kip-Kap... Cheers! Cinzano Soda, your aperitif! Where have you been till now? - Going for a stroll around there. Did you have fun? - Yes, I saw a nice car crash in front of the grand hotel. Four cars, go figure. Ok, sweetheart. Hurry up with shaving. It's almost 1 pm, time for the beach. I won't shave unless you first give me a kiss. Go ahead. - Your coffee, Madam. - Thanks, leave it there, Giovanni. Come on, finish shaving. Quick! I'm going to rearrange that inept Giovanni's face. Sweetheart, leave those poor little flys alone. Be careful with the glass in the bathroom, it's not... All right! Tu-tu. - A train departs. Where to? - To Milan. Tu-tu. - A train departs. Where to? - Tu-tu. No, no, I'm sorry. - So confused. One has to name a city. - Yes, yes, to Tokyo. Tu-tu. - A train departs. A train departs? Then I better get going or I'll miss mine. Come on, stop clowning around. - Where to? To Turin. Me? Tu-tu. - No! But Enrico, what are you doing? Are you sleeping? What else, after all I haven't slept a wink. No, look, I'm not in the right mood to continue. No, engineer. - Engineer, give it another try. No, I quit. - For the better. Tu-tu. - A train departs. Ah, I won't depart. I'm striking. Ice cream, tasty ice cream, folk. Who wants an ice cream? For this child her mother pays! Hello. Hello, engineer. - You're wearing a shirt... You got a sunburn, right? Excuse me, it's a gambling bet. Ok. - The latest fashion! Wonderful combinations of negligees and nightgowns! Model Brigitte Bardot Models of any type! Buy it, ladies, and be more seductive than ever. Buy it, ladies, buy it! Hey, Nando, come on, walk, you're always the last one! Come on, walk. Professor, did you have success with the Nordic girl? I managed to catch her and we seem to fancy each other. - Well. It's a pity though that unfortunately I don't speak a single word of German. And why didn't you speak Latin? - Yes, yes. Flat! Engineer! - Hello. Can you spare a moment for me? - Yes. Come with me and don't ask questions. Alone on the immensity of the Atlantic. Careful! We're going to end up in the water! I'm not scared, Madam. I served in the navy. Attention! - Oh! - Excuse me. Hello. - Have a good ride! They're fishing far out! Do you know him? - No, why? As I've understood he's someone very important. Bye! It's a good place. Isolated, quiet. Let's go upcountry, ok? There he is. - What? The brazen swindler. - But, who? He could have at least had a good enough taste to choose another place. Who are you talking about? - Him. Come on, woman, let it be. - No, I'm going to show him what's good. But then... is that why you brought me here? Yes, what did you think? - But can't you see he's wth his wife? Liar. He swore there had been nothing going on between them for two years. You're not going to make a scene? A scene? Me? - Come on. Excuse us. - Hello. Enrico, do you know Mr. Pellini? - Yes, Marletti, yes. Hello. - We already... Mrs. Pellini. - How are you? - A pleasure. The lady... I... It's very nice here. - Yes, it's not bad. Yes, the sea is more... right? Yes, far more... - Yes, of course... On the other hand, there it's more... I mean... I don't know. It's more... no... I thought... I didn't even think. I didn't even think... What's the time? - It's 13:40. Damn! We should be going back. - Yes, I understand. Yes, of course. - Excuse us. Goodbye. You're welcome. - See you. Bye. - Bye. Did you see what type of man he is? - Yes, I saw it very well. And I fell in love head over heels. I'm really stupid! - Yes, that's right. I mean, no! - I'm sorry for involving you. No, but why? I accompanied you without any second thoughts. Let's go slower, I don't want them to see me in this state. Do you know how porcupines make love? No. - How? Very carefully! Giuliana, look. - What? The engineer has returned to the base. Welcome! It has been very nice, Enrico - Hello Isabella. Hello. - Eh? How was the water? Warm? Hot. Boiling, Mrs. Valdameri. Hello. Buy the tasty candy with nuts: "Kiss me"! Remember: "Kiss me"! Will it take you long to finish that jersey. No, not really. Hello. - Hello. How come you didn't introduce me to them? Who are they? - Poor one, a week ago... ...her husband died. But she still came... ...because they paid for the whole season. That's right, they reserved in advance. Look, look, look, look, look! Mrs. Marini! She's navigating over there, with her guardian. Look, Giuliana, look. - Let's go back, come on. There they are, in that boat. Professor! Are you eating here each day? Yes, I'm interested in the hotel life. - Hello. Hello. - Enjoy your meal, engineer. Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. - Hello. Giuliana. Giuliana, did you notice Mrs. Marini and her guardian didn't even get back to eat? Clelia, please. They must have gone to a restaurant. Yes, together. But will you be quiet at least in front of the girl? Look who's talking. It's certainly not me who scandalizes the little one. Other than you I'm not here for some eye candy. All right, you always need to have the final say. But now shut your mouth. As far as I know you, you change the disco if you don't like the music. Do you know why he married me? Not because I was the most beautiful girl from Varonese, but because of my inheritance. - Isn't that reason enough for you? What did you dream about? A great love? In that case you should have just waited for the arrival of a blue prince. I've been a good house husband. No, in your household you weren't any good. You simply lacked the water to wash yourself and the firewood to heat it up. Excuse me, I'm not feeling well. A pity, now that we all eat together and have a good time. Engineer. I know why he went away. He made love with Mrs. Dominici. That girl! What is she saying? - Inés! Please don't hit my girl. Otherwise you'll have to deal with me. She's also my girl. - That's what you say. No, sweetheart, don't cry, my treasure, no. Exuse me. - It's ok. Be calm, sweetheart, be calm. Oh, look, look! Pasqualino, Isabella. The couple shows itself. They have finished their session. Where are they? They look as used up as motor fuel. I bet they won't even be able to get to the table. Giuliana! Come on, open the door. Hello. Giuliana! Listen, I need to talk to you. Please open just for a moment... Engineer! Leave poor Giuliana alone! You men will never understand our sensibility. - It was a misunderstanding. Judy, wait! Where are you going? Hello. - Hello. Hello. - Madam. This year we enjoy a really splendid youth. Excuse me. - Engineer, would you allow me? I would like to introduce you to the Princess Adolfi. Engineer Marletti. Nice to meet you. Marletti. - A pleasure. The princess, with the birth name Boncompagne, is a far relative of Milva. Ah, yes? - Furthermore, she has the entire collection... ...of discs by Natalino Otto. - Otto, right? Congrats. He lives in Rome. - Really? Yes, he's Giuliana's husband. - Which Giuliana? The engineer's wife. - Why won't you present me to her? Doctor. I need your help. I'm sorry, but I'm not a physician. - It doesn't matter. It won't matter. Listen. Since recently, right after having meals I get heartburn, a burning sensation in the stomach and need to burp. I tried various medicines, but none has brought me relief. Yes, but I'm not a physician, Madam. - It doesn't matter. Maybe you can give me something. Even if you're not a physician. I'm an engineer. - There's no difference. At times, even the opinion of an ignorant person can be useful. After all I'm not yet 91 years old and still want to travel a little. To enjoy the world. Maybe you know of some prescription that would do me good, I would like to cure myself. Look, my sisters died in a car crash. I don't have sons, but I got money. But with that terrible stomach pain I don't have the strength to do anything. After eating I remain like a mummy. What are you doing, doctor? Are you sleeping? Madam, if I were a physician I would love to help you... I heard that you're an engineer. I'm not deaf. Giuliana! The key. What's the matter? Are you going? - I need to ask something. Yes, all right. - Wait here, don't move. Hi Sergio. - Hi. What happened? Nothing, I just told her that we have to break up. It couldn't last for the entire season. You understand me, I have to keep my promise. But... They just won't understand that this is my work. They cry, they get all tragic, the get desperate. But deep inside I'm not made of stone. And each time I see them suffer... ...it makes me feel bad. Hi Sergio. - Most of all... Hi. Bye, Enrico! Doctor. Doctor, have you gotten my medicine? Doctor, the medicine. Did you get it? Doctor, my magnesium, did you get it? Doctor, the magnesium. My magnesium. He really shouldn't be a physician. Giuliana. Giuliana, open the door! I told you to open the door! Giuliana, look... I really don't like your behavior, you see? Don't you think you're exaggerating? Why are you sulking? For nothing. - Nothing? What do you mean for nothing? But do you actually think that I have been with that lady? What's her name again? The blonde one. Eh? Eh? - No, Enrico. - What's it then...? What's it then? Let's go for a walk. Make yourself up, I'll wait for you downstairs. I think that I've always been a pretty modern husband. If there is some novelty I'm all ready to talk about it. Let's confront the situation. Who is he? Why do you want me say it? You already know. I realized it from the way you looked at him. When? - What do you mean by when? Last night. Last night? Where? On board of Tagliaferri's yacht. Yes, I know. I should have told you earlier. But I didn't feel capable, Enrico. I beg you to have some patience and that you won't judge me badly. I never said that... You know that I trust you. Thanks. Listen, it would be better if we take a rest, because if not... Good, if you don't want to dance and prefer to talk, then let's go. - Do you prefer that? - Yes, dancing has never been one of my strong points. Professor, you're an ace. You allow me? - Oh, my poor head. What a heat! My husband is a satyr. My mother didn't want me to marry a man from the south. But I... I never had racial prejudices, I always did what crossed my mind, unfortunately. I can assure you that today I would act in a totally different way. But, Pasqualino, what are you doing? Clelia, look! That's enough. Let's go. I'm tired. Excuse me. Hi, there we are. How are you? Let's see. One, two, three. Who will reach me a hand to get off the hand? Be careful with the arthritis. Oh my! Come on, let's dance. Pasqualino, I'll buy you. - Hi Giuliana. - Hi. My husband, Sergio. - A pleasure. - Nice to meet you. Let's go out for a moment, Giuliana. Go figure, he has fallen asleep! Believe me, Antonio, it's better this way. It's better for both of us. Yes, better for you, perhaps, I won't deny it, but... or rather, I would deny it. But for me it's different, Giuliana. I... no, I won't say. I'm going to condone it all. No, Antonio, it's not possible. I can't betray him. You can tell me that I'm worthess, that I'm foolish, a stupid woman. But I can't, I'm not capable. Don't tell me that between you and your husband... No, you're mistaken. No, no, it's not true. Our marriage... ...has been almost complete, perfect, wonderful. No, I can't. I don't want to throw it all away for some moodiness. Listen, Giuliana. Why don't we talk about it again once you're husband has left. No, Antonio, the conversation is over. Besides, it would be better if we stopped meeting. Furthermore, that English dresser from the XVIIth century I commissioned... What should I do? Send it to you? Cancel the order. I couldn't stand the idea of seeing it around the house. It would remind me of too many things. Too many things that should better be forgotten. Oh, my dear husband! - Isabella! Carlo! - Go figure, three hours and twenty minutes... ...since I passed the customs on the highway. - Bravo. It's all thanks to the Maserati. Now look into my eyes. Take a good look. How much did you cuckold me? - A lot. Sweetheart, I cuckolded you many times. Come, I introduce you to my friends. I want to you to meet Giuliana's husband, he's very likeable. Engineer, I introduce you to my husband. A pleasure. - Nice to meet you. Straying from your wife? - You better look after yours. Carlo! - Did I bother him? Ah, my back! Enrico, Giuliana, don't go to bed! We're going to eat spaghetti at Rossi's house! - Let's all have dinner together. Come on, let's go. Let's have dinner. Giugi! No, you go. No. I will go to bed. Engineer, but what are you doing? - I'm going to bed, it's too late. Enrico! - Pasqualino, let me be. Don't you like spaghetti? - No, it's late. Don't go on with your stories! - Be quiet. I saw it first. Would you allow me? What manners! - No, no, it was me. Stay calm! Let me look! I want to look! - What are you looking at? The moon! - The moon? Let me see. Let me see this moon. - But do you see it? What a rascality! Gustavo, I'm sure this has been your idea. One moment, one moment! Please let me help you. Thanks. I start with five thousand. Yes, five thousand. Fifteen thousand. No, I'm out. Good. Cleia? - What? Don't they eat in here? I'm going to look if the spaghetti... ...are already cooked. - Yes, take a look. I deal out. One. One. Twenty thousand. One moment. Forty thousand. Two hundred thousand. "And the dice no longer tell the score. You don't remember: other times assail your memory." Who wrote that? Eugenio Montale. Ah, yes. Four hundred thousand. No. You can't see the cards. No? Guys, the spaghetti! - The spaghetti! The spaghetti is ready! Let's eat, guys! Ready! Let's go! - My mouth is watering! I come first, after that the women and children. Let's eat! Engineer! - I'm coming. I'll just finish this and... Thus, it's two hundred thousand, right? No, two hundred and forty thousand. Engineer, they're getting cold! Forty thousand are from the previous game. - Ah. Should I fill in your name? No, just issue a blank check. Enrico, come here! As soon as you're ready... - Yes. It's already the fourth time we're eating. Something to drink? - No, thanks, I'm not thirsty. Adelina! Bring the Conde Bellanca a plate with spaghetti. Do you know who that is? Now I remember. It's the undersecretary of state. Hello. - Hello. But sweetheart, that's our butcher! Guys, we meet at 1 pm at the beach, and then we'll... ...eat at the fisherman's, all right? Enrico, do you really need to go? - Well, I don't know, I may leave right now. Soon the day begins, I want to avoid the traffic. - Clelia, don't you need to go to Rome? Go with Enrico and keep him company. - No, I would just bother him! - I'm not a young girl anymore... - No, Madam, you won't be a bother. - Will the little one also go? - No, Inés won't go. Oh, what a pity! Let's all go to bed! Bye. - I don't know what you're doing, but each time you look prettier. Will you return on Saturday? - Once more. - No, leave, my love. You need to drive. Bye. Come on, children, get out of here with your rubber boat. One, two, three... One child is missing, Renato! - Luca! - Where is he? - Luca! - There he is! Come on, let's go! No, look, that one's mine. Come here, Pippo. I found him, Renato! Engineer! Did I keep you waiting? - Don't worry. Goodbye, Inés, behave well. - Bye! Look after dad! I'm ready. Enrico! Bye! Bye! Engineer, you know that you're a conqueror? Yes, yes. My daughter is in love with you. She turned red. Inés, eat well, get to sleep early... ...and don't spend too much time in the water. Hi. - Hi Sergio. You're leaving? - Yes. Lucky you. I talked to my friends. You don't need to worry about your wife. I already told you our job is somewhat similar to the mafia. Bye. - Bye. Hi Lella, look. Let me introduce you to the engineer Marletti. Hello. - Mr. and Mrs. Soldrin. A pleasure, Madam, nice to meet you. - He's Giuliana's husband. You're leaving? - I'm going to Rome with him, but tomorrow I'll be back. Of course. Lella, do me a favor, make an appointment at the hairdresser's for me. I want to change my hair color as soon I get back. - Bye! Radio bulletin: Yesterday 150 Germans traversed the Brenner-road. Numerous accidents at the French border have been registred. No news from the West. Riccione and Cattolica are being flooded by Germans, Englishmen and Swedes. There have been numerous cases of damage on the route of sun. 25 deaths are the result of the latest count early in the morning. Viareggio is also almost completely occupied. The magistrate has invoked... THE END
