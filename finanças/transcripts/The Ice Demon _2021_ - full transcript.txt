[pants] [keeps panting] Stop! [keeps panting] We'll stop here. Let's not go any further. - Alright. - Got it? Yeah. Yeah. [keeps panting] Make it tighter! What? Make it tighter! Damn! It's not working, the ground is too hard. You hear me? Uh. Here, hammer the stake in. Into the ground. [keeps panting] [exhales] Nika! What? Nika! What now? [keeps panting] We aren't gonna able to call for help tonight. It's too late. I will not sleep near a corpse! You will! The weather's too bad. There's nowhere else for us to set up the tent. I will not sleep near a corpse! Yes, you will sleep near a corpse! Alright then, we'll move it. [keeps panting] Nika? Nika. Nika, what's happening? [pants in panic] Hey, buddy! Come here. [exhales] Hello, little cutie. Dig in. [laughs] For real! Well, and so then I told him: If you ever give me this crap instead of decent bud again, you'll be smoking it. [laughs] Yeah. And he goes, "OK..." Oh! What are you doing here? Oh, you are feeding our dog. What do you mean, yours? It's ours. We play with this dog here and feed it. Get out of here. I'll go if the dog comes too. Savelyeva, I already told you. The dog is ours. We're playing with it. And what do you play with it exactly? A game. [whistles] Come here. [clicks the tongue] Want to play too? The game is better with a group. There's one bullet. And there are... six of us. Semyon, are you crazy? It's a fair game. [chuckles] If you win, the dog is yours. You have my word. Eh? Are you going to try? Or are you scared? Whoa! [exhales] What the hell is going on? Who fired a gun? What is this? [breathes shakily] Tell me, whose gun this is. Mine. Not yours. Your old man's. What were you doing? Nothing, just hanging out. They're blanks, Misha. Do you think I'm stupid enough to load the gun with real bullets? Nothing to say? It's like he said. We were just hanging out. Give me the rounds, Semyon. Blanks, really? Come by tomorrow with your father. In the car now. Misha, I would never have let her shoot herself! Are you following me or something? Think you get to make decisions for me? Even if you had never shown up, I would have handled it just fine on my own. I have known them for ages. Why the hell are you butting into my personal life? What are you doing? I won't go without the dog. You're not putting that dog in the car. No. it can walk. OK, then I'll walk with it as well. Let's go. Fine, then put the dog in the back. Your mother's worried! Come on! Hurry up! [exhales] Come here. Here. [exhales] Come here. Come on, buddy! [sighs] Could've handled it yourself, huh? Let's go. Evening, Major. May I report? Report. Two girls found a body near Goltsovo. In the mountains? Yes. You wrote this? My fingers were cold. If you do it like this again, I'll transfer you. Got it? Yes, sir. - Now... - [sniffles] One girl died. The other one? Yes sir, and the other one has frostbite. You identified them? Working on it. Kolya! Turn the music down, would you? It's killing me. Presumably... This body spent several years completely frozen solid. It's odd though, the epidermis is nearly undamaged. Initial exam revealed a hematoma in the... occipital region. I'm gonna do an autopsy on the cranium, and analysis of the victim's lungs and stomach. Got that? Mm-hm. Kolya! Get him to the intensive care unit, quick, he's bleeding! Why did you let her bring the dog into our house? [sighs] What was I supposed to do? Forbid her? I don't know. Maybe talk to her somehow. Talk to her? Talk to her about what? What is there for us to talk about? You know that she never listens to me. I don't know. Try to find the right words. It's just not that easy. Well... well, on the other hand, if we agree to keep this street dog, she can look after it. And show some responsibility. Uh-huh. And what if she doesn't? We're giving her a chance to make her own mistakes... All people make mistakes, right? Yeah, they all do. Then they regret them their whole lives. Or maybe they don't. Ksyusha, answer the phone. [sighs] Sorry, I'm a little confused now. Who are you talking about... exactly? - Hello? - About our daughter. You? Mom... It's the hospital. They found Dad. Good evening, Dr. Savelyeva. Hi. Where is he? In the intensive care unit, but... you shouldn't go in yet. I'm sure I can decide that for myself. You can't go in. I'm the department head. Who are you? The Chief of Medicine flew me in. I'm a neurobiologist. - You're family? - I'm his wife. Ex-wife. How is he? He is in a deep coma. Under quarantine. I know the rules perfectly well. I'm going in. So then you know that only official relatives are allowed to visit him. I'm sorry. I'm his daughter. Officially. This is my mother. Make it quick. Family only. Sorry. Hello. Hello. What happened, Misha? Did you get yourself a rival? I wonder how he managed to end up in there. No sign of him in 10 years... and he looks alive? He is alive. But the same can't be said for those girls who found him. Huh... Have you ever seen anything like this? The frostbite is completely black. Have they said anything? One of them won't be saying anything ever again. The other one is in the next room. I'm waiting for her to come to. Is there any chance he'll come to? There's always a chance. He's alive. It's a miracle. [sighs] And where's this miracle been for 10 years? [breathes shakily] Matvei? Matvei? He opened his eyes! He opened his eyes! You should not have gone into that room! He opened his eyes! That's impossible. It was just a muscle contraction. No, it wasn't just a muscle contraction He looked at me. Please, calm down! I'm so sorry. It was just your wishful thinking. Who are you? What are you doing here? This case is unique in the history of medicine. He has to be studied! My husband isn't a lab rat to be studied. I'm taking him home now. Why would we do that? And what if it were you in his place? Look here, honey. This monitor indicates all of your father's vital signs: pulse, blood pressure, oxygen. And most importantly, the on switch. It must stay on. If it happens that the oxygen... hmm... runs out, the machine will generate a long warning beep and then you will have to replace it. In case I am not around, here is what you will have to do: you will turn this valve, here, and then, after it's all done, you should connect all this stuff to the tank, then unscrew the key. That's it. - Got it? - Yes. Do you really think he can hear us? Of course he can. That's why it's important that we keep talking to him. About what? I barely remember him. [grunts] [grunts] [exhales] All your old baby things. There's so much here. Your photos. You were five in this one. So funny. [chuckles] [chuckles] [sighs] Even my old blocks. Yeah. Your Papa taught you to read with them. Another picture. You look so happy in it. This was his favorite sweater. [sighs] How come you've never talked to me about him? Why would I? He left. And we stayed. But why? Did he stop loving us? Or was it because of Misha? [exhales] What are you hiding in here for? We're sorting old things. Looking for a proper place for them. Put them back when you're done. [sighs] [sniffles] You should be studying for your exams, not digging through some old junk. [exhales] Hi there, Misha. Why are you here alone? Where's your dad? Can't we just do this without him? I... truly regret what happened. I mean it. Give me the gun. [exhales] [chuckles] [sighs] What were you thinking? Misha, if he finds out I had his service weapon, he'll kill me. Just as well he should. You and Ksyusha are not going to see each other. That's not really up to you. Fine. Then I guess the gun's staying with me. Guess it is. Tell Ksyusha I said hi! Matvei... Matvei, can you hear me? Matvei... So, what is a coma? Essentially, a coma is one of - the types of deep sleep. - Come here. Both sleep and coma are activities of our subconscious that are not studied completely yet. In ancient times, people believed that during sleep a person's soul and body may split creating some entity that can be called an astral body, which would navigate across different layers of reality. That is why, theoretically, a person or his soul, can be reached while he or she is either sleeping or in a coma. How is this done? As it is generally known, all people's dreams are filled with their old memories or with some other vivid, emotional and precious moments for them. So, in order to establish a connection with somebody who is asleep or in a coma, you can use special triggers in the form of words or items that can relate in some way to the emotional moments in the past you shared together. [laughs] Matvei, do you think I look much older now? Tanya? Are you going to sit here all day? You should go out for a while, get some air. You know perfectly well that he requires constant care. Has he woken up yet? No. Tanya, have you forgotten how you ran away from him that day? Do you remember you called me and asked me to come to help you? And I came. For almost a decade... I didn't know if he was alive or dead. I've been thinking about it for 10 years. I know. It's just strange. He could be dangerous. Dangerous? How could a man in a coma be dangerous? Maybe you're the dangerous one? Or maybe you are the one who should stay away from my home? Away from me? Away from my daughter... Don't come back here again. Tanya, open the door! We're not done yet. Tanya. Papa, if you can hear this... No! Knock it off! Go lie down! OK. Papa, if you can hear this, give me a sign. [sighs] I'll try this one more time. [inhales] Papa, if you can hear this, give me a sign, please. [sighs] [gasps] Shh! Quiet, Dog. Go! Go lie down. [gasps] Lemme in. Hey. Are you nuts? Why couldn't you use the door? Uh-huh... Cuz Misha would've let me in. Oh, hello! Whaddya name him? - Dog. - Dog? Pretty cool. Not gonna take off your shoes? Look, Ksyusha, um... back there with the gun... [exhales] Well, it really was... loaded with blanks. Semyon, why are you here? You forgot your flashlight. Oh, cool! I had the same ones when I was a kid. Ksyusha... let's play: I will roll the block, and if it's a vowel, then... I have to tell you something about me. Consonant, you do. Are you in? [exhales] [exhales] [exhales] [exhales] [exhales] [inhales and exhales] When I was 10 years old, I ran away from home. [chuckles] I came back after three days, [chuckles] And I thought my father would kill me. But, get this, he was sitting there, crying... He just said, "I'm glad you came back." And didn't do anything to me. Your turn now. [inhales] I don't remember my father at all. And now, they brought him here, and I don't feel anything. And I do feel. - Misha, ever heard of knocking? - You! Get the hell outta here! What did I do? - This is my room, Misha! - Let me go! [pants] I remember saying you couldn't see him. It is none of your business. Really? Whose sweater are you wearing? Mine. No, it's not yours. But it's my dad's, OK? Oh, [sniff] I see... [sighs] No, I can't come to Moscow right now. Have you ever seen this before? [sighs] Well, I'd like to wait till the victim regains consciousness. Yes. Did you look at the scan I sent earlier? The brain activity is extremely odd. Yeah. Write me as soon as you see it, OK? OK. Yeah. Alya! Alya, can you hear me? Alya! Why did you leave us? Misha? [gasps] [exhales] Good morning, Mom! Good morning. Mom, what is that? Did Misha do that? Mom! No one needs to know what's going on in our family. Are you scared of him or something? I'm not scared of anything. [exhales] Dog, come on. Let's go. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Here. [exhales] Here, buddy. Get it! Come. Good boy. [gasps] Look, it seems like... Misha totally flipped his lid after he found out your mom got your old man back home. Do you know if I can press charges against him without telling her? I don't know. Doubt it. Or maybe there is a chance, though. My old man told me that... that Misha got arrested a few times when he was younger. Misha fought with your dad, too. That doesn't sound like the Misha I know. Why not? You know him. He's a tough guy. He's, you know... protecting you. First... he protected your mother and now you. Protecting us. Uh-huh. Oh, my dad is here. Hey, what are you doing tonight? Any plans? Don't know, not sure yet. Tomorrow? I'll text you later, if I can, OK? That's cool. I'll see ya. Mm-hmm. Get in. Hey, Pop. Hey. So, how are things at school? It's fine. Thanks. See you tonight. Sit down! Anything you want to tell me? No. Where's my piece? I don't know. Look me in the eyes. I ask you: where is my piece? I told you, I don't know. You do realize you're screwing me over, don't you? Like I sad, I don't know, OK? You shithead. Why would you take it? Why would you... sit down! If it's not back this evening, it's your head! Do you understand me? Screw you! [exhales] [suffocates] [moaning] [moaning] [moaning] [suffocates] Tanya? Tanya! Tanya! [gasps] - What happened? - [exhales] Nothing happened. You scared me, I sprayed myself. Tanya, what's going on with you? This again? [clears throat and breathes heavily] I had a strange dream recently... [sighs] [gasps, pants] I'm so sick of you! [laughs] [groaning] [groaning] [suffocates] Misha, what is it? Misha! Mom! Mom! Looks like he had a mini-stroke. There is also a chance that he might have peripheral paralysis. Has he ever had any problems with his blood pressure or...? We've never had any real problems at all before. Ksyusha, where is your mother? Why isn't she here? Thanks, Vera, but we can handle it ourselves. [pants] [swears in Russian] [keeps panting] - What are you doing? - [keeps panting] He ran out of his oxygen. I was doing exactly what you told me to do. I told you not to touch anything in here! Mom, please calm down. Who told you to turn it off? Was it Misha? Or that doctor? Mom, calm down! [gasps] [pants] [pants] About demons? She must have been delirious. I remember I had a case when I was young... A family was found in the woods: a mother, two girls, all dead. But they couldn't find the father. Put out an APB, all that... He was hiding in the basement all that time. So, I asked him: "Why did you do all this?' He gave me this nasty giggle and then he said: "It wasn't me. It was demons. It was demons." What did the voices tell him back then? You remember? They wanted a body. "The demon needs a body." Was he institutionalized? Shot himself in the head. Some people are often scarier than any demons, know what I mean? Dammit. Right. See you later. Take care. Dog! Dog! Dog! Why are you standing here, outside, with no coat? My dog is missing. What do you mean? I bet... He's off running somewhere. Ksyusha, are you crying? Come on, don't worry, it'll definitely turn up. Bet he's sitting somewhere gnawing on a bone. [gasps] Ksyusha, c'mon... We can look for him together, I mean, if you want to... My mother hit me today. [gasps] Right. Come with me. Come on! What do you want me to put in your bag? Which things do you need? Ksyusha... Say something. He'll freeze out there. - Who? - Dog. Dog? He lived on the street! You are the one who nearly froze. Get your things. Let's go. You need this? I can't leave them like that right now... Why not? Ksyusha, there's some weird stuff going on in your family. I've got a plan. We'll live in a hostel. I can't leave them like this. Your father? Or you mean Misha? They don't care about you at all. They don't give a shit about you. I do, though. Ksyusha, Ksyusha... look, I really want to help you. I told you that I'm not going anywhere. It wasn't a question! Understand? Go away. Get out of here. Bitch... [gasping] You weren't listening to me... - I need you. - Let me go! Now! I really need you! I need! [suffocates] Open the door, bitch! Open the door right now! Open the door! [cries] Matvei, don't! I told you to stop! [cries] Who are you leaving me for, huh? What's his name? Matvei, please, I beg you, please don't touch me. Tell me who you're leaving me for. Where are you going? - [keeps crying] - Who is it? [keeps crying] You bitch! [pants] Ksyusha... come here. Come here. Come on, it's OK. Don't be scared. Come here. Don't be scared, sweetie. Come here. [pants] Ksyusha? [keeps panting] Sweetie, where are you? Ksyusha? [keeps panting] What's the matter, honey? Huh? Why are you hiding here? What happened to Mommy? Don't worry, Mommy's fine. We had a little argument, but that happens with all grown-ups. That doesn't mean they stop loving each other. Understand? Huh? Come here. You're not scared of me, are you? How about we play our favorite game? Want to? Whaddya think? Huh? [gasps] Hmmm. Huh? [whines and imitates crying] I won't let you and Mom leave. I need you! [pants] Ksyusha! Ksyusha, Ksyusha, I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean to. I don't know what came over me. Ksyusha! [pants] Ksyusha? Dog! Hey, Dog! [whistles] Hey! Dog, you in here? Hello? [whistles] Hello? Doggie? Hello? [panting] Ksyusha! Ksyusha, open up! I want out! [grunts] [pants] Semyon! Ksyusha! [keeps panting] Ksyusha, open the door. I can't, the lock is jammed. Semyon, do you have the gun? - Yeah. - There's one round left, right? Yeah. In that case, lift up the gun and blow your brains out. [moaning] [sighs] [gasping, moans] [pants] - Come on. - [gasps] Where is the girl? The girl died about three hours ago. I finally received my colleagues' findings regarding Matvei's brain scans. This is an ordinary coma patient's brain. And this is Matvei's brain. Here, all the neurons are dead. So, he's dead? Well, his brain is. But somehow, as we see, his body is still functioning. There must be something in him that's keeping him alive. Until we understand what it is, any contact with him could prove fatal. Ksyusha, where's your mother? We have to be extremely careful since we don't know exactly how he is influencing Tanya or how we can stop it. Let's just go. Here's a sedative. It's just in case. Mom? Tanya? Tanya, are you here? Where were you? I couldn't find you anywhere. With the doctor. Doing what exactly? We've finally received an update on your ex-husband's condition. I need some samples. It'll just take a minute. You can't go in there. Tanya, let the doctor by. Why do you need this? Need what, exactly? My family. You want to destroy my family! [pants] [screams] [screams] [screams] [pants] [screams] [exhales] Misha? Hmm? Did I kill him? No. He was already dead. [sobs] Why doesn't Mom remember it? [exhales] She doesn't know it. You both ran away. I came back here. I collected your things. He was lying there covered in blood. I decided to move his body. She was defending herself? How could she have lived with that? Knowing she murdered the father of her child. Do you think it's really over now? I hope so. As they say, the Lord gives and He takes away. So, how are your ladies doing? They're fine. Asleep. - Well, all the best to you. - Uh-huh. Oh, and you were right. Sometimes, people can be worse than demons. Told ya. What was that about? Eh... We swapped stories. So, you need me to sigh some papers? [gasps and exhales] [sighs] Yeah, there too. Hey, Misha, I wanted to ask... Has Ksyusha seen my Semyon? Do you know? I... keep calling him, he's not picking up the phone. [sighs] Fedya... they're grown-ups, aren't they? They can sort this out themselves. Alright? Sort it out, my ass. [exhales] Misha, could you please still ask her about it? I'm his father, I'm worried about him. Said she's asleep. So, what do you think? Who could have bashed Matvei's skull in? He never did anything bad to anyone. Except for your Tanya. What are you hinting at exactly? I'm not hinting at anything. I'm investigating. That's my job, as you can see. It's just kinda strange... He went missing 10 years back. Now he's taken away again. Weird, don't you think? What do we have here? I don't know. Can I look inside? Go right ahead. Semyon! Semyon! My boy! [pants] [screams] [pants] Hands in the air! Let me see your hands! Get down on the floor. No, Fedya. What are you doing? - Shut up! - Stop! You killed him! [screams] [screams] Time is 2:30. Determining death of the patient as approximately two hours ago. But the condition of the patient's skin integument indicates his death likely occurred much earlier. Possibly several days ago. All metabolic processes have long ceased as well. And decay is occurring extremely quickly. But something was keeping him alive. Something was keeping him alive. The demon needs a body. The demon needs a body. [gasps] [breathing deeply] Alright. That's enough. Enough. That's enough. OK. [gasps] [inhales] [suffocates] [pants] Why did you do that? Fedya, please don't. It wasn't me. Who then? I swear to you. I didn't do it. Then who?! It's Matvei. You're dead, asshole. Fedya, don't. I have no idea how to explain it. I swear to you, it was him. [pants] I need to save my daughter, Fedya. I beg you. [keeps panting] Go on, shoot. I didn't kill him, Fedya. I swear it wasn't me. Please. Who will give me my son back? [gasps] [gasps, pants] [laughs] [laughing] Where have you been? Come to dinner. Where is Misha? [laughs] Papa is here. [laughs] There's no one there. Papa's always with us. Mom, Papa's dead. [gasps] Don't say that ever again! [panting] [gasps] [pants] Ksyusha! Misha, I can't open the door. It's stuck... Misha, Mom has lost her mind! Ksyusha! Can you hear me? [laughs] [laughs] [pants] [pants] [grunting] [gasps and pants] [gasping] This is our family! Mom! You murdered my father! Remember! [pants] I didn't murder your father. I didn't murder your father. I didn't murder your father. You killed him because you wanted to save me. But you know he's gone now! He's always with us. I'm still right here. He left us and we stayed! We stayed! You must forget this! You can't love anyone like that, Mom! He will never let me go. Mom! [cries] [pants and cries]
