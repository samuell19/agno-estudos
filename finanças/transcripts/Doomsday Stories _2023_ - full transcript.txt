You thought it was going to be someone different? Man in the sports and was brought to earth to share with you, The Tales of the Forgotten The brain virus started in 2019. In the first two years, almost 5 million plus people died worldwide. In 2022, a new strain hit. 5 million people a month were dying, no vaccine was effective. This created high gas prices, food shortage and war. Nothing really mattered anymore. People are dying of starvation and disease. Nations were at war in 2025, a final strain goal “meanies” pretty much wiped out mankind. Only 8000 people worldwide survived. “Meanies” was a man made virus meant to help cure people, but instead created mutants, savages that outnumber the human race. One man ZOROK survived this hell on earth. He was was neither good nor bad. But in this society who can judge he did what he could to survive. Now, 30 years later, after the great rise of Balrog, he now lives the simple life hidden away. The “meanies” died out and very few live to cause any problems. Zora over the years has taken over what is left of society. He would like to share these stories from the old world. You'll have a grandstand seat here to one of the most momentous events in the history of science. In less than a minute, you will see the most powerful explosion ever witnessed by humankind. What a beautiful morning. Love it. My favorite meal of the day. I look forward to this. Still can find water. Ugh. I remember the day. I remember the day when I found this come out. My groups out scavenging. They'll be back any minute. We're willing to share what we have. We're a peaceful group. But be warned. I've survived for years. And if you threaten me. Oh, fuck you up. I've been watching you. There's no group. You're alone. Start running. Because when I catch you, I'll kill you. Oh. Oh, fuck Back at camp again. Where is the group that Oh fuck!! Oh!! Ow! Oh! Ow! Not today, you little bastard!! I survived for years. It's going to take an army to take me out. I shoot him. Who's all aaahhhhh!! Oh, oh, ROT IN HELL YOU BASTARD! I thought we were. Oh, yeah. What we have here. Oh, wow. What a shame. What do we got here? Looks like a bestseller. I'll be the first to review it. I got plenty of time to read it. Sorry. I wish I could give you a proper burial, but the animals will each have. And that was a terrible day. Terrible day. Oh, she shared a lot of stories in here. Plenty of time to look through it. Plenty of time. It's 2021 in the world as we know it has come to its demise. No, I'm not a religious man. And honestly, I could give two fucks about your God. But the Bible is right. This shit would happen and all mankind would be wiped from existence. Who knew it would be manmade? The Meanies virus is finally starting to take over my dog. Lucy keeps me company as I wake up each day and breathe the death filled air. I put one foot in front of the other as I head towards my final goal on this earth. Now, most won't agree with what I'm planning to do, but those are the same fuckers that haven't walked in my shoes. Emma and Grace, I love you both and hope this act is forgiven. One day the virus hasn't completely wiped everyone out yet, sure is working fast. Everyone is out here just trying to make it one day at a time. As time goes on, food has become scarce. I don't know how much longer Lucy and I can last, but I'll keep trying. Listen, I'll do what I can. I have a wife and a daughter. I got to keep them alive. They haven't eaten in the last couple of days, please don't kill me!! Please don't kill me!! Please. Please Listen, man. I get it. We're just out here every day trying to make it. I'm Rick. I'm Ray.

You wait here, okay? I'm going to go find us some food. You wait here, baby girl. This meanies virus has turned our life upside down. Putting things in perspective, I realized to make the best of each day with Lucy. Girl, we never know when our last breath will be. I've lost track of how long I've been here.

I've lost track of the days. At this point, does it even matter Lucy and I came across another hopeless soul become numbed on death and destruction and just want this to end love you, baby girl. Where did everything go wrong? You know I need you more than you need me. I made a promise to Mama and I failed. But I got my reasons.

Please stop, Stop. I can't stop stop. No, no. There's no Balrog anymore. They're all gone. It's all in my head. It's no Balrog. Am Zora. There's no power, okay? It's all in my head. I'm alone in all alone. No Balrog, no meanies. No Balrog, no meanies. Just calm down. Read a story. You feel better. Hey, you know, I'm getting so excited about the trip. I know you were here last summer, but I only got to see you one day and a piece of another day. And remember, I was there last fall for eight days, and I only seen you one time. This time I want to spend a whole week with you and catch up W hat? A bomb threat. Are you kidding me? I hope it doesn't interfere with my plans. What is this world coming to? Kim? I'm sorry to wake you. I heard bombs. I mean, it could be something else, but I want to turn the news on I'll call you back. Kim? It's really bad up here. The roads are closed and they're telling us to go to a local bomb shelter. I hate crowds. I wish I would have came to you a week sooner. If I'm going to die, I don't want to be up here. Remember that guy we met at the cell cafe? He said he had a bomb shelter. He was going to help me with my business. Yeah, I know, but you know how those nerdy types are Smart, But innocent. Harmless. If I stay there and if you just catch a plane and things calm down. I packed, already packed. I'm going to call you if I can start making my way down there now, cause it about five miles away. But I need the exercise. I will. Hi, Alvin. I'm so glad you answered the phone. This is Katrina. We met at the cell cafe last summer. I was with a blond girl. Oh, yeah. The long, brown curly hair. You wanted me to do a business website for you? Yes. Yes, that's me. I hope this isn't too bold of me, but do you still have that bomb shelter? Yes, I'm in it right now. Oh, my area is really bad and I hate crowds. I was wondering if I could stay the night and hopefully I'll be able to catch my plane tomorrow. See, as long as you are alone. I don't like crowds either. Do you know how to get here? Yes, I have the address, but I have to walk because all the roads are blocked. I'm going to cut through along a wooded path off Spring Street. That's the fastest way to get the Hell Creek. I should get there before midnight. Oh, wow. Lucky night for me. Spooky, but how perfect. So glad to be out of that area. Listing out now. Wow. I really appreciate you doing this. And when this all blows over, I still want a website for my business, and my plane takes off at 2 p.m. tomorrow. If it takes off and we can talk more, then it's been a really sure. No problem. Get some sleep. The neighborhood here is quiet and everyone else is asleep in government bunkers. I noticed it was more quiet around here. I can't tell you how grateful I am to be here, that I feel safe. You know, I'm thinking about moving. We'll talk more about that. Let me show you to your room. What are you doing you sicko!!! Whatever I want sweetheart. This is my domain and I like how it feels! You show me appreciation for all I'm doing for you You're sick, sick weirdo and a rapist. How many others have you done this to? You are my first dear, and I'm going to take all I can. And with this war, no one will miss one woman. With all the fatalities going on, this is Survival of the fittest. What you realize it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. The famine and the fate of this world is coming to. This is the beginning of the virus meanies. I have enough food here to last me three years and later today I want to get a whole lot more before people even know what's going on. I saw how you and that blond girlfriend of yours were laughing. Who's laughing now, huh? I'm more prepared than anyone You are one sicko. I tell you what, I'll help you get me out of these cuffs. I'll help ya gather the food. Do you think I'm going to fall for that? You have me pegged as that weirdo you refer to me as. But no one. No one is going to mess this up for me. And by the way, I work alone. What is this? What are you doing? Please, please don't do this. Let me go. Please. Oh, it's too late. This has to be done now. Please. Oh, no, I'm still alive. Okay. This is the food that will sustain me. I remember. Yeah, I do remember. My sister, Kate. She loved resorts. She loved the beach. I remember the last time I talked to her. I'll never forget that day. You kind of called that. I called my sister I gotta call Kate. Oh, God. Come on Kate. Come on Kate. Oh, yeah, I like. Good. What's going on? What the hell just happened? Guy took a knife, stabbed the guy in the throat, and then he started ripping out his throat with his. He was eating him. He was eating his throat and his blood. It is. Kate. Kate, Answer. And then he turned around, looked at me, and I ran. Oh, God. Kate, please pick up. Maybe it's a new strain of virus. I don't understand. It's bad. Kate, why aren't you picking up? You always pick up by the second ring. You get that superstition thing you got to pick up by the second round. Something bad is going to happen. Well, guess what? Something bad is happening. Hey, bro, you on speakerphone? Look, dude, I'm not afraid of any virus. Why would I be? I think I'm healthy enough to get through this. Kate, can you please pick up the phone? I'm not hiding in my room. I can't have a huge fight tonight. A big payday. So I got to go do what I got to do. Oh, God. God, God. Kate, why are you not picking up the phone? You supposed to pick up the phone? I feel good. I. I feel strong here. Why don't you come over here? You won't wimp a fucking flight. You too, Kate. I can only imagine the worse I failed you. I'm so sorry, Kate. I could just imagine you needed me and I wasn't there. Oh, so you just ran over to your house. But I was scared. Kate. I was scared. Please. I hope you just hiding. And you call me and say. Don't worry, brother. I'm okay, and I'm coming to get you and we'll kick these people's asses together. We're going to get it right. Kate. You I'm coming. THIS IS THE POLICE! PUT YOUR HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD!! COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! You have the right to remain silent before things got too bad. Hmm. Desert. This is how the world is. Everything changed or disappeared. Except the sea eternal. Mining Needed your maximum power. The ruins of what was our civilization. Today it's a wasteland where they are the majority and reign over the little group that remained of our time on earth. They stalking, hunt humans. Something in their brain still works, and that makes them eliminate everything that is different from them. This petty way of thinking is the only thing they have maintained after converting into the monsters they are. Little by little, successive governments were eliminating employment, replacing us with machines and degrading food and water with low defenses. Fear and stress. The wave of the meanies virus found no obstacles to wipe out the majority of the world's population were to I was alone, completely like an inhabitant of a remote island. No job, no family, no friends. Trade with the exchange of goods disappeared, but the money remained, and the climax of this madness exploded with a speech by our President. My fellow citizens, we all know that the economy of our country has become unviable. We have to open it up to trade with other countries. And as you all know, that means in exchange, our contribution in this exchange will be, based on our most valuable resources, our people. Today, I have signed on behalf of our country an international agreement by which we will become the main suppliers of organs to all the nations that need them. This President wants to communicate that in order to increase the security of the human population and preserve its survival in a world where the zombie threat is growing. I have arranged for all who wish to join a new program of the World Guard at your local chapter. Requirements for this new program are that you must be free of viruses that will be determined by an app through the tablets that the government has so generously provided to you. You must have no family ties of any kind. You must willing, if required, to be part of Project 25, consisting of the incorporation of artificial prostheses that will contribute to the design of a super soldier that ensure the survival of the human race. The governments of the Union have provided us with the latest biomechanical and bioelectronic technologies. For all those who take advantage of the exchange plan that we will publish on the government website, may God bless our nation. Goodnight. Oh, what else could I do? No job, no goods, nothing to sell except parts of my body. The government was desperate. Its oldest members began to deteriorate and did not want to die. Our organs and members would serve to replace theirs. Its scientists had solved compatibility problem long ago and I always wondered how it was that with that advance they were unable to stop the expansion of the meanies. I was without mind eat and I needed to eat. The opportunity to do so came in the form of a recruiter who would later be the surgeon who removed my kidney and approved me for the program. 25 to 25, consisting of the incorporation Be a part of Project 25, consisting of the incorporation of artificial substrate to the design of the super soldier. At that moment, time left part of my humanity for money. First they placed a biomechanical instrument on my life as if something no more human started. I killed a lot of enemies participating on many campaigns. But something deep inside me made me tonight killing humans over and over again because the government considered them opposition. But one day my brain chips intercepted this conversation. Mrs. President I got your message regarding the problems with 21. Exactly. Madam. We await order, Madam. They did well. 21 was the first people know him. It was because of him that recruitment began to become popular three times. And he doesn't confirm or three times Shall we turn it off Madam? Send the message again to return to base but doesn't respond. Shut it down. And bring it back. Understood Mrs. President. Enough. This must end. There she is party proud, but afraid his time is coming to an end. The fire will purify the evil that spread and I will have been faithful to my humanity. We are not born to be a part of what we can be. We were born to be free. Man. Man. That brings back some memories, some bad memories. When It all started. Emergency alert to all citizens. This is not a task. The hell's going on to your nearest shelter. No army task forces. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, we had two shelters. And my God, what are we talking on? Somebody approaches to your car. Come on pick up the phone. God bless us all. Hey, Frank, have you seen the TV? You have fucking seen it. Look it right now on TV No shut up. Go get get Kelly and Will meet me at the cabin. Don't tell nobody. Grab as much as you can. Right. Frank, do you have a gun? You should. Yeah. I've got enough artillery to blow up the fucking state. Yeah, man. Fucking kill, man. Kill. What was that? Frank, you sound kind of strange. You okay? Never better. Look, I'm going to gather some things. I'll go pick up Kelly, and we'll meet you at the cabin by nightfall. Okay. Be safe, mother fucker. Cock sucker. Kill... mother... fucker... car, you are left at your own risk. My God, What have we done? What have we done? Every city, state and country around the world is now affected by. The virus. I mean, hospitals and medical facilities are already cracking under the sudden strain. The CDC has determined that the situation is much the same across the entire country and in fact, around the globe. I mean, hospitals are so full that they're already turning people away. Martial law is now world wide. I mean, we no longer know who our allies or our enemies are. Is it China? Is it North Korea? Is it Russia? Is it some new major? None of that matters anymore, folks. The Great War is not killing us so much as the virus is wiping out our fellow countrymen. I mean civilization as we know it, as we knew it is crumbling. I mean, states aren't even states anymore. They're just wastelands. We are now under a class one emergency. That means no one is allowed on our streets or highways anymore. No exceptions. Our officials clearly want us hunkered down in our homes. Half proletarian police have been given the orders of shoot to kill. Now they claim that they hope this will help them contain the virus and regain control. Anyone caught disobeying is subject to execution. I feel so pretty. So now I ask why am I still reporting? Is there anybody even out there? Is there anybody listening? I'm getting reports of large scale power failures and massive grid explosions which can only cripple our civilization that much quicker. There are rumors out there that Russia is trying to knock out all our satellites in space. So cell phone service, cable networks, the Internet, all gone. And to get this up, it's killing me. We have always been warned time and time again throughout the years about Judgment day. Well, here's what folks. It's here, right here, right now. Welcome to Judgment Day at our crumbling little civilization has been judged and we have been found wanting. Anyone who hears me now, God bless. Stay. Stay strong. Somebody has to survive this Move in the shadows, flee the big cities. Do what you have to do, but stay alive. Keep humanity going. This is this will probably be my last broadcast. So pray for me and I will pray for you because I am pretty sure that we're all fucked. Hello? Yeah Kelly. It's me. Yeah, I just talked to Frank. We're going up to the cabin. Please get packed. I'm coming right now. I'm going to leave. It's crazy out there. I hear gunshots and screaming. I see smoke an emergency vehicles all over the place. Kelly, please go get packed and get ready. Blue skies and green trees is just you and me Making love by the fire. Baby, I don't think I'm going to make it. I'm burning up and I'm spitting a blood. And I don't feel good. I'm a mess. I don't know how to tell Kelly, listen to me. Don't give up. Please don't give up. No, Kelly, don't open the door. Don't open the door to anybody except me. Kelly, please don't give up. Won't answer the door. I feel fine. Now I feel fucking angry. I want to kill her. I won't kill you. Listen to me. Don't answer the door, please. I'm coming. Don't let anybody in. Don't let anybody in. And don't answer the door. I'm coming, Kelly. I'm coming. Once you help, I want to rip your clothes off. I wanna rip your heart out. No, if you're here, I'm coming. Don't answer the door. They'll kill you. I'm scared help me. Telling Kelly. Kelly, please listen to me. Listen to me. Please don't answer the door. Begging you. Please. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What's going on? How could this be happening? Yeah, it's killing me. I got time for one more story. Dana, are you okay, baby? It's true, Tommy. I love you. Aster we're too late! We're always too late. Take us back. Let's try again. All right, Aster. Let's go. We did it Aster. We prevented the virus! There is not a meanie in sight. We got to go back one more time, though. We have to save Dana. That was the plan in the first place. Stop the virus. Save my wife. We got to go back. Oh, no. Aster the meanies are coming back through, we failed. Begin recording. My name is James Kirk. No, not that one. But my parents were big fans of the television show in the movies? Yeah, it was better times then. Things are pretty normal. Then the virus came. Some bank robber was running from the police and somehow ended up getting into a high tech medical lab and startling the lab workers who in turn dropped their contained genetic virus onto the floor, smashing its contents into the lab, killing the lab workers and the robber and releasing the killer virus onto the world. Governments tried to organize and come up with plans to stop the killer virus, but it was too late. Masks were implemented right away. Those that refused were infected. Some got deathly sick, others went crazy and died within minutes of the virus inhabiting their bodies, others going mad and slowly becoming something else. Masks didn't help anymore. No one was safe from the virus. Within two years, the world fell into chaos. Countries went to war, states fell. Governments were no more madness ruled the streets, cities fell in flames and the end was near. The end was at hand. The ones that survive the government called them meanies and for good reason. The Meanies band together and would attack anyone and anything that moved. Now, with the help of the alpha time suit I stole, I borrowed from the Branson Time Phase Corporation. I'm going back in time again to fix it. Present. I must travel to the past after recording Aster, it started over again. What makes this 164 times 172? James All right, well, make preparations. We got to go back again. We have to save Dana. James again. I must warn you that I know. Look, you warn me. 172 times, okay? I understand. Let's just do as I say. Trust me, okay? I know what I'm doing. James, you have an incoming transmission from the brass to turn Things Corporation. Chad Webster. That's just perfect. Bring them up. James, you need to stop. Stop what? You know what you're doing? You're manipulating the system. Give them constant overrides and we cannot shut you down. You are using an outdated alpha times, and you're messing up the timeline. You also stole the technology and you using the suit to change the past an alter the future. Your intentions are good, James, but this needs to stop Now. Listen to me, boss. I've been working on this for years. Just let me make a few more trips and I'll fix everything. I mean, that's why we're all here, isn't it? You inherited a typeface from your mom and dad. They it all. What kind of future do we have when the virus has wiped out half the population? Sorry, boss. I'm going to go back and make my changes. It's my way or the highway. Have you made any progress? Yeah plenty. Just give me some more time. Boss, I can do this. This goes on my better judgment. But I believe in you, my friend. Do what you got to do. Thanks, boss. I won't let you down. Great nightmare. Asta, switch back to the watch mode. Asta let's go. Take us back. Asta, where are we? We were supposed to go back in before Dana was assaulted. James, This is where Paul Brad's after Chad grabs his father. Creative Time, faith in his life. Interesting, Asta. But what does this have to do with saving Dana and stopping the virus? This is time. Baze, in its earliest, crudest form time phase, was created here crude, but yet it led to what it is today. If we are to save data, stop the virus and fix the timeline I have created a construct we must follow. You said to Mr. Bradshaw, You've been working on this for years. Yeah, So? Well, so have I. I've been running calculated runs all this time, and I finally have a pattern to fix everything. But you will have to trust me. We have to do this in order to protect the timeline from changing again. We can correct all your mistakes, Save DNA and stop the virus. You once asked me to trust you. I'm asking you to trust me. Do you trust me, James? It's my very life, Asta. Just tell me what to do. Get ready for several. Time's up. I can explain along the way. Ready? Yeah. Hang on. Let me mask up. Let's go. Let's go. Baby You all right? James. What are you doing here? So old. Hey, What are you doing?!! The whore's mine!! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's why she's gone again. Why can't we get ahead of this? I thought you said you had a plan. Dana's dead! Again!! I'm sorry, James. Uncalculated risk. Get ready for another time, jump. All right, let me mask up. Let's go Asta. Oh, David, I'm so sorry. Asta Why is David still in jail? I thought we corrected this on my last time phase. Face it, Jim. There ain't no Asta. Excuse us, sir. James, When you changed the timeline earlier, Maxwell never became a police officer and ended up on the wrong side of the law. Because of your earlier changes, Captain Maxwell goes at being a street thug. Hey. Well, you do it, too. Where ya hidin' the chick? Look David, I'm sorry I messed this whole damn thing up. This is all my fault. You're not supposed to be here, pal, but I'm going to get you out of here. I promise. I'm going to change things back. Made them the way they're supposed to be. I promise, man. I'll fix this, man. I'll fix it. Say Jim, that's a bad outfit!! Excuse me, Asta, Let's get out of here Where'd that motherfucker go? I want an APB out on this guy, Larry LAX. Cornelius, what's the last three or four anyway? Let's get one, boss. Right. That smile up your face. This guy is dangerous, you understand? I put the word out. He's good as cut. Get out of my face. Give me some results. Sir. Help me, sir. Oh, yeah. I'm a transfer from Hill Street Blues, and I'm supposed to see a captain Jason Maxwell. Oh, Hill Street. Yeah. You've got the right place, sir. Oh, right this way. Oh, thank you. Nice badge there. Thank you. Who the hell are you? How are you getting it? It's just good to see you back where you're supposed to be. Keep up the good work, Captain Maxwell asked me what in the name of Major Tom Emerson is going on here? Was that James Kirk? Can I help you with something? No, Just looking for something to snack on. I got too much I wouldn't mind snacking on you pretty thing. I smoke some weed last night. I got the munchies. Just need snacks. It must be fuzzy. Give me snacks! Give me snacks!! Say, what was the matter with him? What's wrong with him?! It's called a meanie mam. There's got to be more. So lock up your store now, James, Close the door and put out the sign. We got to close the shop. I don't know who you are or where you come from, but thank you so much. What should I do about him? Call the police. You don't worry about him. Leave it to me. Just get this door locked up now. All right? Okay. Thank you again. You're welcome. Get out of here. Asta, get us out of here, baby, Are you all right? Baby are you alright? James? You doing here? Hey, what are you doing? That whore is mine!!! Asta why? She's gone again? Why can't we get ahead of this? I thought you said you had a plan. Dana's dead! James, Dana is not dead. Vitals are stable this time. The bullet only grazed her. She will be fine. He is done, Max. And he will be arrested shortly. The authorities arrive. We must return to the Times to get now. All right, let me mask up. We knew you committed that robbery on Second Street, so you might as well confess who your accomplices are. Was it Bernie? Oh, sorry. We'll go easy on you. But face I telling you nothing, Pig. Who do you think you are? Lord Vader. Shit! We'll see about that tough guy. I'll just let you sit there and think about that. But either way, you're going down from that spot now. Squash you like a bug. Do you understand me? A little, little light piece. Doodie! Doodie? He's a piece of shit. What are you, six? What are you laughing at lowlife?! I'm sitting here being a good boy follower is going to tear you a new one man's spot. And I'm going to come back here. It smash you like a bug. You understand, you little idiot. You understand that little worm, little maggot? I mean, listen, if you're trying to scare me, it's working. Well, where do you come from? What are you. Are you a spaceman? Yes, I am from outer space. And if you do not comply with the humans, we will split you into atoms and spread them across time and space. Now tell them what they want to know or I will deatomize you! You Do you understand? Human? Yes. Yeah. I'll tell them everything. Just. Just don't deatomize me. Please tell them everything. Human or I'll be back!! Hey man. I did it. Me and Greg. Like I'll do the time. Just. Just don't let the space man give me space, man. Space, man. So you're going to give me a full statement that you did it. A complete confession? Yeah. Anything, man. Just. Just don't let the space man get me. It's going to tear my atoms apart and go get Bernie, too. He's guilty as sin. You must be high on something. Well, all right. Get his confession. Process them and find out more what we can pick up. Bernie, you got it, Captain. Come with me. Medic. That's it. We did it! With Mike in jail He can't harm Dana. She should be waiting for us in 2050, providing nothing has happened since her last incident. Neologisms? That is correct. It will take me some time to calculate the new existence. We still need to stop the virus from happening. We've not explored that avenue. What do you wish to do next? Take us home, I said. I want to see Dana. Worry about the virus later. As you wish, James. All right, Come on up against the wall. You deadbeat dingleberry. Hold this! The other way. Turn it over the other way. Turn it over. Where are you going? Come on. So we can see it with your hands. Come on, let's go get your picture taken. Here, have some space, man. It's a space, man. A space man. Officer has. Yeah, space man. Like you coming in for the coffee and donuts? Come on. I got a nice jail cell for you. Dana, are you here? Incoming call from the Brad Stewart Times Corporation. Correction The Hailstorm Time Days Corporation. Put them on. What are you doing now, Kirk? Who are you? You know exactly who I am. I'm your boss, CEO and President of Helston time based corporation. And you have been using my Asta device and a time suit that you stole from me to travel through time and make unauthorized corrections in the timeline, coupled with outlandish comments of everything that you would do if the corporation would only get behind you. And now this Have you gone mad? Now wait a minute now. No, you wait a minute. You're a troublemaker and it is subordinate to taking your credentials away A long time ago you're going to get arrested, you're going to trial, you're going to be found guilty and you're going to be sentenced to death by hanging the next time I see you will be at the end of a noose and transmission. Asta are you still under my control? Yes. James, something has gone wrong with the timeline. I blocked out all control. If we are going to fix things, we need to move now. What the hell is that? James Kirk. We warrant for your arrest. Open the door or we will break it down. What about Dana Asta? Why isn't she here? Running calculations, but we need move now. James Kirk, open the door. Right. Alright Asta. Let's go. If she's here, she's safe. If not, we'll find her. Let's go now. Asta what happened to Dana? Now, after we changed the timeline, it prevented a kidnaping. It was a car accident that landed her here in the hospital. Records show she is okay and just needs to rest. Well, thank God for that. James, is that you? Oh, baby. What happened? Sweetheart? What happened to you? I've been so worried about you. You know what happened here. So yesterday I was in an accident. James, You look so old. Are you getting enough rest? I just maybe tired. Don't leave me. I won't leave you. Just get some rest. Asta, is Dana going to be okay? Is she going to be waiting for us now in 2050? Now I suggest we find the man who started the virus, our bank robber and Mr. Bernie Cromwell. Do you have a fix on him before the robbery? Affirmative He's at the bar on Brewhouse Street, giving up his nerve to rob the bank. We stop him here. Wait. Time for action. He's in a rundown hotel on Winchester Street. Well, good. Let's go. Drop me right on top of that creep. Be interesting. I will place you in the room. Listen. Yes, that would be fantastic. Asta, let's get back in the timeline and get this thing stopped. Don't worry, baby. I'll fix this. Let's go Asta. Let's suit up. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. All right Asta. I don't see him. And what a pain. Drinking beers, got pizza. James, We don't have time for that. It is Bartholomew is accessing the timeline, causing turmoil across the time circuit. The virus will have to wait. Bradshaw is gone from the timeline. We must find him to replace Bartholomew for another quick trip back to 1986 to see Roberta Bradshaw. It is necessary. Chad must die that night. The time has to be invented because of interruptions. We are spinning off into an alternate reality. Oh great not that again. All right, give me a minute. Let me mask up and let's get out of here. And we don't have time for pizza. There's always time for pizza. Hang on. All right, After I'm ready. Let's go back to 1986. Roberta. Oh, my gosh. James This is like the 10th time I've seen you. The sixth actually. Roberta What's wrong? I kind of screwed up the timeline this time. You see, Chad you never becomes president of the time faced corporation. And now it is taken over by some crazed tyrant that is using it for his own purpose. He's only trying to make things better for himself. He doesn't care about anybody else. He doesn't care about the virus. He only cares about himself. But what do we do different this time? Well, we know this Chad goes to the wrong of town. He meets some chicks, has this fight, and ends up being thrown off that bridge. This makes you and Paul create time travel so you can go back in time, save Chad so he grows up to become president of the Time Phase Corporation. And everything is right as rain again. So what am I supposed to follow him around to make sure it happens this time? If you have to? Yes. We have to make sure he dies to put everything back in place. So what do you saying Chad doesn't exist? Well, we don't know. For all we know, he could be so big. James, if you two are done accessing timeline. Chad, Brad Stewart is a garbage man in Owatonna, Minnesota. A garbage man? Oh, we got to fix this, Roberta. I got to go. There's nothing wrong with this profession as a garbage man, but he does need to become president of time base. Yeah, well, Roberta, I hate to lay this all on you again, but we got to make sure it happens this time. His future. Your future? My future. Everybody's future depends on you. Making sure this happens is time the right way. So pressure, right? James? If you two are done, we need to find Bernie Cornwell's, the bank robber. All right. Take me to his location. Let's go catch this. A bank robber. All right, Asta, let's go have Hey, buddy, I want you to let me show you how to do that properly. I don't want you to pull some muscle. Something I've been training people for all my life, actually. And guys like you, I could really help out by giving you some whoa day. I'm your big freaking guy. Whoa oh, oh oh, oh. What are you going to do, Cry? Show me what you got, Tough guy watching me Got a place to be. We're gonna go grab some brewskys They're going to knock off this bank. Yeah buddyyyy!!! So a Wait a minute, buddy. Let me do this fair. Okay. Oh. Oh, Who you sure are, big dude? All right, Asta, suit us up and let's get out of here. All right, Asta, get us out of here. Dana, are you here, baby? James, Incoming call from the hailstorm. Apologize from the brass or Fits Corporation? Chad Rochester. Oh, well, at least we did something right. We got rid of Bartholomew, put Bradster on. Okay, James, get me some good news. The good news, boss, is your back way. I don't understand. Look, boss, it's a long story, okay? We stopped the virus from happening made some other little adjustments. But I couldn't save my wife. I. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't prevent her death. Oh, James sorry, James, but my mom and dad didn't have time travel us to go back and save my loved ones. We can't just be changing things willy nilly in the timeline. I'm sorry, boss. I think there's something you ought to know about your past, and you need to know about it right now. James. That would be unwise. Some things are better left unsaid and leave things the way they are. I guess you're right. Ask them. What was that, Easter? Nothing, boss. Everything's fine. I'll see you Monday morning. I thought I heard something Dana! Where have you been? I wanted to start dinner, but I didn't know if you want to. What was that for? You have given two years. I had. I mean, I love you. I never want to be without you. Oh, hang on. Oh, no Asta! Well, how did you know? Where did she go? Started coming in. Now, James, something has happened in the past ago, after a friendship, the virus still happens. These are everywhere. And Dana has been lost back into the past. Unbelievable. All the work for nothing as to how many times have we gone back in time? 186 times, James. Well, you better make it 187 times. Have. Let's go Asta. Yeah, that's it. No more stories. Oh, shit. Last time I see one of these, I think my name's Hope. Spent a long time since I've last broadcast it. Hopefully if you find this, you don't shut this off. I'm alive and with healthy survivors. We've survived Balrog and his army of means. Our rescue station is a heavily guarded fortress that is safe. The food, water and most of all, each other. You can find us at the end of the lost highway. Join us. That's we civilization. See how true this is. Let's go follow. See this rescue station? It's great. Great radio voice James, maybe this sounds somebody with you. Hopefully that bastard that we should be after me for dead Zarek. I'm ready to blow you to hell where you belong. Zarek is finished. Yet another chapter in his life. And he's on his way to begin a new one. He once again travels a lonely road. The promise this time the promises of Rescue Station. It's been years since he's come across any human contact. He'll travel far and meet many more obstacles. Challenges. Roy waits for his return eagerly, but he is already out the door. And Zarek has survived this long. And he'll survive even more doomsday stories
