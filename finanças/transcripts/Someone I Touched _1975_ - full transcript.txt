Whoa. GIRL: Oh. TERRY: I'll get it. Hi. You Terry Wayne? -TERRY: Yeah. -Can I talk to you for a minute? Uh, can it wait? It's 12-all. It won't take long. That medical exam you took for your job last week, in certain cases we get the results. Is there something wrong with me? No, it's nothing that can't be fixed. I'm afraid you got yourself a case of VD. You're putting me on. Infectious syphilis, first stage. Uh, well, that's no big deal, I mean, nowadays, is it? FRANK: No. No big deal. At this stage, it's not even dangerous unless you're pregnant. No, no chance. Okay, but you will have to get treatment. And I'll need a complete list of all your sexual contacts for the last six months. -Oh, wow. -Not right now. Just call me the first chance you get at this number. It's County Health, Frank Berlin, like the city, you won't forget? -No. -One more thing, if you don't get treated right away, it can be a bad scene. I mean, for you, for anybody you're with. You're extremely contagious. Yeah. MAN: Come on, Terry. Where you going? [LAUGHING] Whoa. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] You work in the weekend? [SIGHS] A deadline. This has to be at the printer by Tuesday. DAVE: You know what my father used to say about career girls? The next thing they'll want is the vote. And louse up the country? Ridiculous. -[LAURA SHRIEKING] -[SAM GRUNTING] LAURA: Oh, no, no, no. -You cannot. -SAM: I can. -LAURA: I'll get you right there. -Oh, no. No! No! [SPLUTTERING] Oh, you lunatic. -Your hair looks great. -Oh, thank you. One of these days I'm going to get my act together. I'm going to change my hair and lose about 10 pounds and buy myself a string bikini. Oh, you and Sam, he bought me one last month. Not in my wildest dream. Why not? With a body like yours, you can wear one of those things now. SAM: Dave, can I borrow your son? Oh, there he is. BOY: More, more. Hey, hey, that's a great idea. I know. Why doesn't everybody stay for dinner? I'll get some steaks, we'll barbecue. Sam, I don't think we can tonight. Oh, why not tonight? We're not doing anything. I made other plans. SAM: Oh. Big mouth husband goose, organized wife, embarrassed. There you go, slugger. Well, we got to go anyway. I must have forgotten to tell him. Now, if you were serving veal piccata, I'd stay, but steaks? Well, you're all invited for dinner six weeks from next Tuesday. We free that night? [WAILING] MAN OVER PA: Okay. Print that take and let's do one more. MAN 2: Camera reloading. MAN: Cathy, how long did that scene run? CATHY: Two minutes, 12 seconds, it looked great. [ALARM RINGING] JOHN: Twelve extras. Larry, 12, yeah, eight men, four women, summer wardrobe, right? Yeah, later, huh? Hey, this is crazy. You've got a five-day spread on Meg. She's cheap, man, another deuce is all. Plus 2.8. Hey, is John Eddie here? Oh, sure, right around the corner. Bad timing, babe. I've got to talk to you. Make it quick. Can't we go someplace? No chance. My director's on his way. Well, come, on. What's the big crisis? Why didn't you tell me? All you had to do was call. Call about what? You gave me a case of VD. Oh, come off it. Okay, listen. Scene 13 to 12... John. I've got syphilis and you gave it to me. And you're out of your gourd. They just told me, John. Hey, I'm not arguing with what you've got, but you didn't get it from me. No way. -How do you know? -Because when we made it, -I'd just gotten back from location. -Shh. And when I get back, I always get a checkup, you know what I mean? And I was clean, baby. If you're looking to hang it on somebody, what about that dude Tommy that cut out on you. No, it was you. Sorry. MAN: Hey, Big John, time to go. Coming. You know, it's funny. Here I didn't call you again because I figured you were too...inhibited. Now, it turns out maybe you hung a deuce on me. You stink, Big John. JOHN: Yeah. Well, give me a ring when you're back in action. [CLICKS TONGUE] WOMAN OVER PA: Produce department is now having a special on cantaloupes. MAN OVER PA: No waiting on check stand number two. No waiting on check stand number two. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: The express lane is open for shoppers with 10 items or less. [CASH REGISTER RINGING] Can I have your driver's license, please? MAN: We also have a special on navel oranges, 10 pounds per dollar. Check on six, please. [CASH REGISTER RINGING] I'm sorry, I have to close for a minute. WOMAN: Produce department is now having a special on cantaloupes. You had some tips. Could I see that? CLERK: What for? I just want to see. CLERK: You want to go out tonight after work? Huh? CLERK: You and me tonight after work? Can I take a rain check, I've got something to do. [LAUGHS] Dumb. Am I dumb? "I made other plans." "What other plans?" I'm sorry, honey. Oh, there's no need to apologize. You'd think after almost four years, I'd at least have felt it. It's fertility time again. Basal thermometer goes up and hope springs eternal for Sam and Laura Hyatt. You know, one of these times, it's gonna take. And you're gonna blow up like a blimp and I'm gonna have to... -Oh. -...wheel you around... Oh, now... In a wagon. Not only dumb but wrong. We already made it. This isn't a seduction. It's a celebration. How far along? Four months. Four? Why didn't you say something? Oh, I like keeping secrets. Damn you, baby. You'd blab it all over town and then in case I lost it again... -You're not gonna lose it. -Oh, I know. I went to Klemperer today and I'm normal, "normal" normal. Now, let's celebrate. And just for once, make love just for the hell of it. Hmm? You've got a date after my special dinner. -Mmm. Mmm. -Mmm-hmm. Oh, for once, you know, before I die, I'd like to see my wife, my well-organized wife, just go wild, let it all hang out. I'm having enough trouble just hanging in. [CHUCKLES] [ENGINE STARTING] [DRILLING MACHINE WHIRRING] [PHONE RINGING] -Hello? -Hey, Big Mama. I had a thought, take a pregnant lady to lunch. [LAUGHING] Cut it out. SAM: Well, how about it? I can pick you up in 20 minutes. Oh, honey, I'd love to, but I'm feeling a little peculiar. Peculiar? Oh. Oh, nothing to worry about, like the flu, you know, coming on or something. Anyway, I want to work on this book. You know I have this five month deadline. It's more like three now. I'm not letting you work those last two months. Oh? Well, we'll see. Thanks for the offer. Anyway, see you tonight? -Okay. -Okay. You told him? -Last night. -And? -And... -So? -...everything's super. -Good. Yeah. It really is, boss, as good as it's been in a long time. Well, I don't know what I'm feeling so good about. I'm going to be losing the best associate editor I ever had. Oh, you'll survive. Oh, yeah? Was that a lunch date you were turning down just now? Oh, I'm gonna work on getting Pecksniff out of the land of the hobble gobbles. Oh, yeah. Well, just a quick bite downstairs? [MIMICKING PECKSNIFF] How about a quick bite upstairs? [MIMICKING PECKSNIFF] Hmm. Of course, my dear. Oh, Paul, I'm really gonna be sorry to leave. That's mutual, lady. Sometimes I think working here has done more to keep me in one piece than a couple of those $50-an-hour professionals I have consulted. Oh, yeah? Yeah, and who am I going to consult with to save my 50-an-hour, would you tell me that? Because you maybe the sanest one around here. Oh, yeah, come on. No, I mean it. Think about it for a minute. Harvey, with his terminal athlete's foot? Militant Mary, with her crew cut? Her latest book is Patrick and the Police Person. I won't believe that. Not to mention Daryl, who's been working on that elephant book so long, he's beginning to act like one. Yeah, all those peanut shells. Oh, worse. I said something to him yesterday and he trunked at me. -Daryl trunked at you? -Yeah, he did. He went... [IMITATING ELEPHANT TRUMPETING] I said, "Daryl, what does that mean?" -He said, "What does what mean?" -[PHONE RINGING OUTSIDE] -See? -Oh. See that's what I'm talking about, lady. You're an absolute oasis of sanity in a madhouse. It's mad here. Tell you what, let's do, let's have me order up lunch and we can blue-pencil the first chapter of Pecksniff together. Remember I made you a promise? You will give birth to your first book before you deliver your first child. That's final. Okay, but just some crackers, though. I'm feeling... [SCATTING] [ENGINE STARTING] ENID: Mrs. Brill? This is the State Bright Cleaning Company. You have been chosen as one of the lucky winners of our mid-week special. We will clean all the drapes in your house for only half... Same to you, kiddo. Terry? I'm late for work. Yeah, you're three hours late. Where have you been? Don't worry, I switched shifts with Bonnie. That doesn't answer my question. I had something to do. ENID: Well, I figured that much out for myself. Terry, you were out of this house at 8:30 this morning dressed real nice for a change. I wanna know where you went. I went downtown. Look, Mom, I think I'm entitled to some privacy. I pay my share of the rent around here. Don't use that tone of voice for me. I get enough of that on the phone. All right. You know that steno school you've been bugging me about? Well, that's where I went. You did not. Oh, Mom, what good does it do to tell you anything? You never believe me. If you went there, you would have told me right away. Well, I decided not to do it. Terrific. See? I knew you'd be mad. I make more money at the market. We've got a union. Yeah, all you meet are married men and bums. Tommy wasn't a bum. ENID: Tommy dropped. No, he didn't. All I'm trying to say is that with your looks, if you got a job as a secretary or a receptionist even in some fancy office, then you'd have a chance to... I don't wanna get married, Mom. Oh, sure. Wait. What for? You're 20 years old, you got plenty of time. Wait. Wait till you get pregnant or till you fall in love with some twerp from the supermarket then you'll get married. -Mama, will you please. -And then you'll have kids and then when your looks go, because they don't last, believe me, -then he'll run out on you. -I'll see you later. Then you can get a job calling up frauds who hang up on you all day. I wish you'd pick up your messages. Oh, don't nag. General Western called. Beams will take eight weeks. Cancel it, we're laminating. And there's a man in your office and... News flash. Laura's pregnant. Sam, that's marvelous. Oh. When? How long? Four cotton picking months. She's healthy as a horse. Me, I'm such a sucker. That was a long haul. [BOTH LAUGH] I'm so happy. If at first you don't succeed... Who is it? Oh, said he wanted to talk about a remodel. I told him we don't do remodels anymore, but he wanted to wait. Okay. Sam Hyatt. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Frank Berlin, like the city. Hear me out, Mr. Hyatt. Oh, that syphilis was a thing of the past. FRANK: It's just the opposite. Right now, it's an epidemic. We can cure it, but there's no vaccine to prevent it. So, the pill, more available sex, VD is out of control. About half a million people in this country are infected with it today and many of them don't even know it. A one night stand with a kid who was barely out of her teens. I don't even remember her name. She did you a favor, Mr. Hyatt. Why, because she didn't give me cancer? Because she gave us your name. See, in the early stages of syphilis, the symptoms disappear without treatment, but the disease is still there. So when it does come back years later, you're in real trouble and in the meantime you go on infecting other people. I'm in real trouble now, mister. I'm married. Look... We're not even there yet. You may not even test positive. My wife is not very strong emotionally. And if I told her that I had syphilis... Well, she's already had one miscarriage, I'm not gonna risk another. Your wife is pregnant? How far along is she? What are you saying? Well, how far along? Well, just tell me. Get it out. [SIGHS] In first or second stage of syphilis there's no danger except to an unborn baby. Well, what harm can it do? Will you tell me? Miscarriage, still birth, brain damage, deformities and sometimes even blindness or deafness around 10 or 11. Oh, my God. But you don't have to worry if your wife just found out. She's four months along. Can you get a blood test today? We can supply the doctor if you don't have one. It's strictly confidential. I got a doctor. How much time do we have? Not much. Up to 16 or 18 weeks the baby is protected. If your test does prove positive, your wife will have to be told. No. She'll have to be treated. Now, look, it's easy, isn't it? A couple of shots while I'm gonna talk to her doctor, her OB. Why does she have to know? See, from our point of view, that poses a problem. I don't like saying this, but... What if your wife has had other contacts? Laura? Oh, that'd get me off the hook, wouldn't it? No, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I meant... Well, what about the question? If the doctor's willing, that's your prerogative. I'm asking about you. Are you gonna blow it? You know, we're in the business of trying to look a disease, not breaking up marriages. No one knows why I came here, not even your secretary. And no one will know unless you tell them. Believe it or not, I'm on your side. -Okay. -But I'm not gonna lie for you. So don't put me in that position. I'll call the doctor. -Oh, yeah, one last thing. -[SIGHS] You mentioned the one girl. Were there any others in the last six months? No. Just that one. PAUL: How about Harold Hyatt? -Now, Harold goes with... -DAVE: No, no, no. How about Henry Eddie Eva Hilda Harriet Hyatt? Well, that's pretty good. How about Henry Hank Hyatt Harvard Hathback? -Yeah, I like that. -Yeah? Oh, thank you. Hey, you know what something, babies names are harder to pick up than book titles? What's the matter with Jim? Jim is great. What happens if it's a girl? -Bill. -Yeah. WOMAN: I have a thing for Old Testament names like... PAUL: And Nebuchadnezzar. WOMAN: Zebediah. LAURA: I'll tell you folks, after several hundred attempts and one miscarriage, I'd just be happy to see the little fella. What the hell's going on? Sam? Oh, Sam. Paul invited us to supper to celebrate. But I called you at the office and you'd already gone. Your wife is a very shy person. [LAUGHS] Four months. I couldn't keep a secret like that for 15 minutes. You know, I told her this morning and she went right to work and produced this beautiful dinner. Pregnant women who work shouldn't be expected to cook. Congratulations. DAVE: Sam, you need a drink. Let me fix you a drink. Hi, Sam. Hey, I just thought, no more leaving Fridays in a moment's notice, right? I bet you're gonna be one of those awful people who only gain about 15 pounds. -Hmm. -Remember me with Mathew? -Mmm. -I was like a horse. They were at our place for dinner once and Laura, she comes downstairs with this expression on her face, "Temperature's up, signal's on." They were gone in, like, 10 seconds. Hey, look at her, she's blushing. Dave, why don't you get out of the locker room? Hey, don't tell me you don't know just 'cause you got a wife with a bun in the oven. SAM: Haven't heard that since junior high. Sam? Oh. [SIGHS] I'm sorry. It's been a lousy day. Hey, I know what this is. This is masculine hysterical pregnancy symptoms. Sure. You know, it happens all the time the woman gets pregnant, the man has this psychological reaction, morning sickness, edginess, strange cravings, want a pickle, Sam? -No, no, Paul, I... -[PAUL LAUGHING] I think I'll wash up. Well, I think I'd like to propose a toast, to Laura. First, because I am a selfish businessman, I hope you produce a children's book that's a best-seller, but much, much, more important than that, in five months' time may you go to the hospital and give birth to a healthy, happy, strapping, squalling baby. DAVE: To Jim PAUL: To Jim. SAM: I said I'm sorry. I'll call everybody tomorrow and apologize. Sam, I know in many ways I'm not an ideal wife for you. You're the only wife I want. I like goofing when I'm depressed. Good news scares the hell out of me. Two different shrinks could switch it around. You know, that's a waste of time, you're perfectly all right. I'm unreliable in bed. That's not true. Well, unpredictable. And I'm sorry because I know you. You need for things to be dependable the way you are. Like a good architectural drawing, beautiful, uncluttered, no wasted motion, no bending under pressure. You're pure steel. I need that, I need your strength. I'm human like everybody else, Laura. But you... You can handle things even when you're not on top. Oh, yeah, sure, like when I walked out on you two years ago. Well, that was my fault. After I lost the baby. A miscarriage isn't anybody's fault. No, I meant after that. And when we split up? I've never felt so helpless in my whole life. You never told me that. [SIGHS] Well, I'm telling you now because I want you to understand that I am not pure steel or pure anything. And I give under stress same as you do. Welcome to the club. Sam. The baby, it just moved. There it is again, oh. No, no, it's too early. No, I felt it. I felt life. Give me your hand. Sam? MAN: Yeah, Tommy took off. Didn't he tell you? TERRY: After school was over we decided to cool it for a while, so I haven't seen him. He's up in Oregon somewhere. Wanted to thumb for a while, climb some rocks. Any special reason? Get his head straight. Could have been you, you know. Can I call him? Now, how do you call a mountain? Just stay loose. He'll be back in a couple of weeks for registration. SAM: You're aware of Laura's condition, her medical history. I'm sure you know how much this baby means to her. I don't know whether she told you, but several times during the last eight years she's been in therapy. Your serum is definitely positive? SAM: Well, I just came from my doctor. I told you. Yes, first stage. But Laura hasn't displayed any symptoms? Well, none. Yesterday she said she felt peculiar, like maybe she was coming down with the flu or something. Have you noticed any swelling in the lymph nodes here or in the groin? No, no, nothing. Doctor, she must have had a blood test when she found out she was pregnant, wouldn't that have shown up there? That was three months ago, she could have been incubated. She'll have to have another test immediately. Yes. Yes, of course she will. But do you have to tell her what it's for? Absolutely. Didn't you hear what I just told you? She may not be able to handle this. That's your estimate. I'm her husband. Let me explain something to you, Mr. Hyatt. My practice is based on mutual respect between me and my patients for one another and for the truth. That's why they come to me. Doctor, we're not talking about your bedside manner. We're talking about the risk of injuring a patient. Oh, are we? Now, are we talking about saving you from an unpleasant scene at home? That's not my intention. Look, even the public health people agree. This kind of thing isn't new to me, Mr. Hyatt. I see it day in and day out. Half my patients are women in their mid-30s. Frightened women, worried about stretch marks and scars, about whether or not they'll be satisfactory sexual partners after the baby. And why? Because their husbands are out pumping up their sagging masculinity, proving their virility with girls half their age. I'm only concerned about the patient, Mr. Hyatt, who in this case happens to be your wife. Okay. I'll tell her. Sam? Talk to you for a minute. -I'm kind of in a rush. -No, no, about last night, Sam. Look I had a bug up my nose. I'm sorry. Laura? Let's get out of here. I have something to talk to you about. I think you said enough last night. Laura, please. I have work to do. Can't just leave it. This is important. Oh, so, is my work. Although you never thought so. This isn't the time to get into that kind of ridiculous nonsense stuff. -Oh. -You wanted... Forgive me, I forgot. You're the one who picks the time and places. Will you let me know when it's time for me to tell you what's bothering me? Get your purse. I want to leave. Yeah, you told me that. You always tell me and I always listen. "Let's wait to have children so we'll have time for just the two of us, Laura." Remember that? Fine, Sam, whatever you say. Oh, brother. "We're gonna buy a house, Laura." "Oh, wonderful, Sam." "We're going to Europe." "Terrific." "Now, it's time to have babies." "Aye, aye, sir." Well, I did it. I did what you said. I'm having a baby and it's too late for you to change your mind. I haven't changed my mind. I've lived my whole life according to somebody else's... Laura, for God's sakes, will you listen to me? And I'm sick and tired of punching your particular time clock. You wanna talk to me? You talk to me at home. [SIGHS] So what's the good news? Let's have it, ex-communication, bankruptcy, dandruff? Is it something simple like another woman? You want a divorce? Tell me what it is, Sam. I can't stand the merry-go-round anymore. I didn't wanna tell you here. Please, Sam. One thing... No, two things. Whatever else, I love you very much and I want our baby. Tell me the "whatever else." I've... Yes, "I've?" I've got syphilis. It was a fluke, a one night stand with a girl whose name I don't even remember. It happened after we struck out for... I don't know, it seemed like the millionth of time. I was unsure, looking down the barrel at my 40th birthday. Afraid. I don't know, it just happened. It's a scream. It's this reader at the office, Mary... Used to tell stories about her husband, who went on a youth kick, how he had a hair transplant, went on those fanatic diets, used to spend more time in front of the mirror than she did. She used to do imitations of him. She had everybody screaming. And she went home one afternoon and found him having a meaningful relationship with the babysitter who was junior in high school. Isn't that a knee slapper? No. Oh, yeah? Where's your sense of humor, huh? Where's yours? I lost it at the Astor or the office or in Omaha. [SIGHS] Here I am digging into what passes for my psyche. Should be thinking about my child. Our child. You are thinking about our child, so am I. That's why we're seeing the doctor right now. Do you want me to go up with you? [DOOR CLOSES] I'll wait right here. No, Sam, don't wait for me. What's with you? I said what's with you? All day or something, you go on strike again? Terry? I don't feel good. Same with me, I don't feel so hot either, but you don't catch me lying on my back in the middle of the day. Won't go to steno school. I suppose you don't wanna be a supermarket checker either. How about a duchess? Hey, Ma, what do you think of me? ENID: [SCOFFS] What kind of question is that? I just wonder. Well... You're my daughter, what am I supposed to think of you? Come on. Better watch out, I might tell you. [SIGHS] Oh, forget it. Well... You've been boy crazy since you were 12 years old. You don't help around the house. You never listen to anything I say. What else is new? Well, I mean... When you had me and you thought about what I might be like, are you proud of me or ashamed? Terry, honey, what is it? [SNIFFLES] It's happened already, hasn't it? Got yourself in trouble. Steno school, dummy. Who was it? That college kid? The one that you're so crazy about? I suppose he won't marry you? It's okay. Take it easy, sugar. Come on, it's not the end of the world. We can get it fixed. You know those things aren't so hard these days. He didn't give me a baby, Mama. Well, then, what? He gave me syphilis. Tramp! You got syphilis? I'm not a tramp. I'm not a... I'm not a... I'm not a tramp. I'm not a tramp. Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh. I know, Mama. I know. 2:00, I'll be there. Doctor, uh, baby... You sure? Yes, very lucky. Thank you. -Want a refill? -I'm fine. Was that Sam? Sam, who? You're really something. Your husband's out in the wind some place and you're cleaning the oven as if nothing's going on. Amazing. I'm just your average American housewife who's pregnant on top of holding down a job at the same time, considering having a nervous breakdown. Just a little one. You're really laughing. I can't get over it. [LAUGHING] Well... You meddling old harridan, what are my options? What would you do if you found Dave was playing around? Dave? My Dave? Oh, what's so special about him? He's got eyes and hands. Remind me to tell you about last Christmas' party. No, he just likes to go through the motions. He talks a good game. Oh, what would you do if he did, for sure? Oh, that's easy. I'd... I'd throw things, scream at him, threaten to take him to the cleaner's. Mmm-hmm, and you'd take him back? Yeah, all day long. And the last thing I would do would be to leave him. Besides, I can't quite see myself hanging out in single's bars. [CHUCKLES] Where did Sam stay last night? I don't know. He didn't stay here. JEAN: 6:30, you need me for anything? No. Go on home. Sam, whatever it is, can I help? It'll work out. You look like you could stand a drink. Good idea. I'll fix it, it's all right. You want one? Why not? Valley Vista Motel? It was the first one I came to last night. It's got mirrors and water beds. [SIGHS] Cheers. Have you called Laura? I phoned a couple of hours ago. Nobody was home. I shouldn't have called anyway. Yeah, she needs time to sort things out. Why don't you come home with me? I'll cook you dinner. Oh, no, um... I'm really not hungry. Strong. How come you never got married again, Jean? Nobody ever asked me. Somebody's missing a good bet. You're a nice lady. No, I'm not. My boss has a fight with his wife and I invite him to my apartment, that's not nice. That's transparent. And very flattering. Yeah. I can see you burning up with passion. It's tempting. The offer still stands. Place to crash, like the kids say. Thanks. Really, thanks, but I think I'll pass. Laura, this is Mr. Berlin of the Public Health Department. I don't understand. What is he... What are you doing here? I have to ask you a few questions, Mrs. Hyatt. Is this your idea of keeping professional secrets? It's out of my hands. When you're finished, I'll give you a shot. I'm sorry. Don't be hard on the doctor. It's a state law. Our department's informed of all positive blood tests. I don't see the reason for this. I'm being treated for the disease. I know where I got it and that's all there is to it. I'm afraid not. But I don't want to talk to you. Mrs. Hyatt, please. I arranged to meet you here because it's absolutely confidential. Your name will never be mentioned. But I have to have the names of the people you had sexual contact with during the past six months. I don't know what you're talking about. I got it from my husband. He got it from some girl. I don't think so. [SIGHS] Excuse me. You have secondary syphilis, Mrs. Hyatt, and your husband has the disease in its first stage. What does that mean as far as my baby's health is concerned? Nothing. You and your baby will be fine. What it does mean is that you've had the disease longer than your husband. So it's... It's virtually impossible that he infected you. [SIGHS] It's a mistake. They make mistakes all the time. Doctors, hospitals, laboratories, everybody. Would you like to see the lab report? I don't need to see it. I know what it says. Mrs. Hyatt, VD spreads like no other disease on earth. It infects someone in the United States alone every 15 seconds. Now, in your case, this particular person may not know. He may go on infecting other people. There's no other person. You yourself could get re-infected. I told you it's a mistake. -Mrs. Hyatt, please. -And I don't have to talk to you. That's right, you don't. But let me tell you something. [SIGHS] I spend every working day of my life talking with people who've been exposed to VD. And if you're lying to me, sooner or later, I or somebody else in my department is going to talk with the contact and your name is gonna be mentioned. And when that happens, I'll be back. It's a mistake, mistake. [DOORBELL RINGING] Hi. -Hi. -Hey, you know, something, Pecksniff stuff is terrific. I showed it to Shirley. -She wants it to take it home to her kid. -Oh. I'm glad you called. We... We can talk. Yeah. We've always been able to talk. You find me attractive, intelligent and even think I have talent. Why didn't you tell me you had syphilis? I almost told you. A hundred times. But... After what we've had, I just couldn't seem to get the words out. Or have a track record at the Ellis, right? I'm a sensitive person, volatile, protect me from shock at all costs, was that your rationale? Oh, I read up on the VD and I found out that all newly pregnant women get a routine blood test, so I... I waited. We hadn't been together for six months, so... I assumed that if you had it, it would show up. When you didn't say anything, I figured you... We were lucky. You endangered my child, mine and Sam's. My God. You'd think I was singing in a church choir at the time it happened or that I got it through an interoffice memo from Paul to Laura, enclosed "please find one case of syphilis" paragraph, "You're hereby absolved of any responsibility per se." Why aren't you laughing? It's just another lousy joke. Please make me understand how you could remain silent and jeopardize a human life? Laura, I swear to God... Were you ashamed of what we did, that you kept telling me not to feel guilty about it? Laura, what's the sense of recriminations now? Because I want to understand why I feel so guilty now. It's not your fault. Well, whose fault was it, then? -Mine. -Oh. No, it wasn't. It was mine, too. [SIGHS] All those excuses that were so compelling to me then... [SIGHS] This feels so tacky now. I'll tell you something. Our love together is very important to me. It was everything an affair is supposed to be, romantic, tender, lyrical. Except, of course, turns out you gave me the pox. Is the baby okay? Yes. No thanks to either of us. And you're all right. Does Sam know? About us? No. My husband... My husband is still under the impression that he infected me. And you know something? I can't wait to tell him he didn't. Laura... Laura, Laura... I see. Let him just go on thinking he was the one. That would certainly keep the moral advantage with me, wouldn't it? I mean, I meant that... I know what you meant. Let it ride. Don't make waves. Maybe it will get better by itself. Maybe you won't have to face it. God. Simple as that. And I could have given birth to a baby with no arms. You might have to face it after all. I told the public health people about you. I had to. They'll wanna know all your sexual contacts the past year and you'll have to tell them. TERRY: So horrible. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's too bad, but some people have to be scared out of their minds before they'll do anything about it. Hey, I hope I didn't get you out here on a Saturday just because of me. I couldn't get off last night. No, it's okay. I had some things to mop up anyway. So what can I do you for? Well, you know the names of those guys that I gave you that I had been with? Well, I left somebody out. Okay. Shoot. His name is Tommy, Thomas, I guess, Chadwick. I don't know his home address 'cause he was in Michigan, but he does go to UCLA and I guess he's at one of the dorms there. All right. We'll find him. I didn't give you his name before because I figured that he wasn't involved, you know. Listen, I really appreciate this. It's important that we find everyone. You see, it was probably him. You know, Terry, most of the people that we talk to here wanna know where they got it from, but we have a rule and I'm not allowed to tell even if I did know. I mean, what's important is getting people treated anyway. The person who gave you the disease most likely didn't mean to. Just as you didn't mean to give it to anyone else. That's the problem of VD. The bug doesn't care whether you love the guy or not. It just goes about its business in making people sick. Anyway, thanks for telling me. I guess you're kinda surprised that they weren't more than three guys. I mean, you probably figured a girl like me... I didn't figure anything. Well, I just want you to know that one of those guys, probably the guy who gave it to me in fact... Well, it wasn't just physical. I mean... I mean maybe the bug didn't care, but I did. [RINGING] I'm cleaning up my office. Sorry. You're sorry? About last night. I... I didn't tell the public health people about you. Well, I wanted to see you squirm. You succeeded. I'm telling them. -Oh, there you go. -[SIGHS] You're leaving before the book's finished. Well, I don't think I can handle more than one birth at a time. -Who do you think you're kidding? -Yeah. You could do both and skip rope at the same time and never miss a beat. So I lie a little. You know, that month we were together last year meant a lot to me too. It still does. Yeah, I know. It's one of the real reasons I'm leaving. Thanks for the straight answer. Oh, I'm full of straight answers today. You know, you realize of course that you and I are much more alike than you and Sam. Oh, of course. That's why he's righter for me. Uh-huh. [MIMICKING PECKSNIFF] Well, here's looking at you, sweetheart. [MIMICKING PECKSNIFF] Same to you, sweetheart. Well, don't be mad if you find that I'm with some other publisher next season. I'll think it's a terrible waste if you aren't. You're taking boarders? Only if they help with the chores. I'm trying to think of some new and original way of saying what I said before. Honey. I've been doing exactly the same thing. I must have missed something. Only think of an original way to say what you said before. About me and the girl? Well, a variation on that theme. How's your drink? Well, it's just fine. Yeah. [SIGHS] Let me put it this way. You know where Paul lives, my boss. You've pointed out the building once. Well, he lives in an apartment up near the top. Chic apartment, Barcelona chairs, paisley sofa. All the stuff you hate. Plus he had this great art collection including an original Matisse drawing, not a litho, an original that hangs over the bed. You see, this disease, this bug that we thought went clockwise turns out to have gone the other way. It's funny because next week we're publishing a children's book of brushing your teeth and the importance of keeping clean. Talk about heavy-handed irony. [SIGHS] Why can't I say it straight out the way you did? Maybe because you knew what it would do to me. I guess so. [SIGHS] Have you got any other good news, flood, plague or is that it? That's about it. Except that I quit my job today after deciding I was Pecksniff and how to get myself out of the land of the hobble gobbles. And, oh, yeah... I think we're gonna have the toughest kid on the block. This will only take a few minutes. -Terry. -Hi. Now, maybe this isn't very important to you, but... Well, when that public health guy told me, I was sure I got it from you. Yeah. I gotta go back to work. It was the other way around, you got it from me. And I'm sorry. Well, like I said before, maybe it doesn't matter, but I thought you should know. Oh, no, you're wrong. It does matter, a hell of a lot. All right? Yeah, fine. Ah. [LAURA LAUGHS] It fluttered.
