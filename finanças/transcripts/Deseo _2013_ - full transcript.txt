Get them! Come here you faggots! You first. Be a good girl. - Why don't you ask your grandma! Grab them! Let me go! Let me go! Get them off me! Get out of here! - Go! What's up, faggots? What is it? You crooks! What have you taken? They're trying to grab me all the time. They think it's free. It's theft. It's just like stealing apples. So? If you take me to the ferris wheel and I'll sit on your lap. You won't regret it. No? Come on. It's almost like flying. Don't you like flying? You freshwater sailor. Are you angry now? Do you want to punish me? Come on, punish me. It won't cost you a thing. So you will remember me, Captain. Where do you live? What's the matter? It's too far. And I'm late already. So is it true... that your sailors only shoot blanks? Holy Mother! Are you going to kill me now? Come on! Come on! My panties! Give them back. My dad has a gun like that. You remind me of my daddy. It would be nice to have a husband. Really. What? Don't I please you? You pig! Francisco... You would make a great husband. Where are we going? What about the Ferris wheel? Can't I go with you? We could go out together. We could go out for dinner. For a dance. Or maybe a beer. Or at least leave a tip! Kiss me goodbye, Francisco. But of course. Just take the little whore. I have to visit my sister. She is sick. Then at least give me your dog tags. Thank you. Who is there? Who? Oh my God! What do you want here? What do you want? What do you have there? - You give that to mom. Why not you? And now you disappear? When did you arrive? Are you going to leave for another three years now? Why did you seek me out? I am talking to you, Francisco. Give me a cigarette. Why don't you give it to her? It's been so long... You could have sent a photo. And you are still the hottest of them all. How do you know that? Are you screwing them all? Not all of them. That would be too many. But I never forget you. What are you doing! There is nobody here. Then let's go somewhere where there are people. We can do it by ourselves... Do you remember? Stop it! I'm going to tell mom. Not Pancho, not like that! Just the same, as always. You know that this is a mortal sin? What? - Imagine if we get caught. I would go again. To hell. Where we belong. Help me. You are evil, Pancho. Wait a minute. You are pushing me away? I have to go back before the boss's grandson notices. All right, then, best regards. What's going on? You seem sad. This is my bachelor party. You are getting married? Who is the bride? I don't know yet. I'm looking around right now. Thank you very much. No training today? - No. Are you not hungry? I am expecting a long distance call. From a woman? Don't answer it. You have a long distance call. Put it through. Put it through. Hello? Are you there? How are you, Albert? Very well, madam, thank you. Very well. Thank you. Here you go. Thank you very much. No problem. - Until next time. Goodbye. Are you taking a shower? - Yes. Again? - Yes. Didn't you have a shower already? It's just... I just... cleaned. I cleand the bath first. Where's my juice? Where's my breakfast? It's breakfast time. Grandma? - Who else, my boy? And you? What's so funny? Move! Back to work! And what about grandpa? - He's on his way. Girl, make my boy something for breakfast. Sit down. And you... didn't you hear me? The plates go on the outside. Come on, girl. You can bring your sister to work too. To work, not to fool about. Did you hear me? I can't hear you! For God's sake. My boy, you're not supposed to show up here like that. You're just bringing chaos to the henhouse. And now I will leave you, my sweet Lila Downs. Thank you, Don Simón. Thank you. Let's get going. Who is he? That's Don Simón's grandson. What's wrong with him? No idea. He's just crazy. Crazy how? He looks pretty normal. Nuts. He's following me around all over. And what about him? How did he end up here? That's the actress from... Ah, that's the one. I see. Stop snooping around. I can see you! Stop snooping around and do your job. More cupcakes! Are you blind? Move! Go, girl! She's so funny. Look at them. Go on, get out of here. Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. - To you, grandpa. Cheers, dad. With all due respect. Where's my little gift? You'll get it on Friday. Hello. The other uniform looked better on you. Won't you come back and work in the restaurant? No, sir. That brings more than ironing for Simón's grandson. Marie! - I'm coming! I have a job for you at the restaurant. Someone will pick you up from school on Friday. No. I'm not going to school on Friday. Not again. On your mother, you will! Look at me. Beautiful. They're thirsty. Thank you. Shall I make you some breakfast? Chilaquiles? Will you do me a favor? Give me my watch. Did my grandfather call? No, sir. Did he say when he'd be here? There was no call. Why are you laughing? I'm not. Wait here please. Let me see. What? Let's see the uniforms. Get closer. Show me. You're not wearing panties? I don't have any. Show me. Come on. You're wearing stockings! Isn't it too hot for those? Take them off. And when someone calls? When someone comes here? No, sir. please! No. Please, no! I know that you are spying on me. How can you think that? It's true. Do you like to watch? Do you want to see? You don't smoke... Marie! Bring me my oil. Rub it on me. Not so much. And the other side. What do you want from me? What do you want from me! Idiot. Have you gone insane? Everyone here knows who I am. Do you want to cause a scandal? Then what is it you want? You son of a bitch! What's come over you? You can't do that! Have you completely lost your mind? Turn that damned music off right now! Thank you. No problem. Do you know where my husband is? Sure. Do you want to die? Don Gambino! - Who is that? My husband's driver! Can anyone see me? That old goat! Your husband? - No, Don Gambino. Come one, let's get out of here fast. Why are we here? What am I doing here? I should be in a completely different place. I don't know at all why I bother with you. How do you imagine that? You thought that I would... What did you think? No, tell me right now what you are up to! Nothing at all. - Nothing? Can't you think? If I had, it would not have gone so well. Gone well... what? Nothing is good, what are you talking about? You are here. Are you raping me? Do you want to force me? Then why are we here? I am in love with you. Why don't you sit down? - No! You know what? You know what? I'll sit down. Water... Come on. And now? Whatever you want... What? You are as old as my daughter. Do you smoke? What are you doing? Relaxing. Really? Totally. - Doesn't that kill your brain cells? No way. But it is hallucinogenic? How do I do it? Watch out, this is chronic. Excuse me? - It's genetically modified. That sounds really dangerous. How long does this take? Until it takes effect? - Yes. Not very long. Then how... will I know that it works? When you get anxiety attacks. - What? Paranoia. - What kind of paranoia? I don't want to be paranoid! Shouldn't this stuff calm you down? Just relax. Just come here. Breathe. Relax. Lie down. Better? My husband. - Where? Here. Oh, no. - What's the matter? I don't understand. - What? I don't know, this is new, I don't know how this works. Don't answer that! What did you do? I turned off the GPS. The what? - Global Positioning System. It tells you where you are. - Exactly... Someone wants to find you. Via the satellites. Sure, and aliens are trying to abduct me. And I'm the one who's paranoid... Stop smoking that shit. What is it? - I can't believe you're actually here. Me neither. I've been dreaming about you since I was 9. It's a fantasy. It's my fantasy. About me? Always. All the time. I'm sorry. You mean you jerk off a lot. We're having a conversation, right? What else would we be doing here. I need to pee. What time is it? Then there's still time. Thank you. Can I... ask you something? What's it like, when you have these fantasies? Can I see? You like to be watched! - Why? Like all the pretty boys. And you have no remorse. What's that? Is your husband much older? Thank you very much. Much older than who? Can he still get it up? - He's a beast in bed. Is he? - Yes. Then why are you here? I asked you this, but you never answered me. You don't love him anymore. How long does love last? As long as he keeps going. Do you get it? Don't you like a joke? - I didn't get it. Come here. You come. Me? Alright. Get up. I can't. Show me. Not yet. Are you nervous? Not at all. Come. Died... What time is it? And gone to heaven. We'll die if it gets too late. You'll kill us! Where's my panties? I don't know. - What should I say when he asks where I was? You were at Aunt Isabel's. Yes, right... If only he would believe that.. My panties! Think of something and get it right. I can't find your panties. Give me my bad. Thanks. This GPC thing isn't true, is it? GPS. My make-up! Will I see you again? You're too young to die. Tell him you don't love him anymore. Or shall I? Don't bullshit me! I can call him right now. Where did you get my number? You're the stalker! The idiot who wakes me up every night! What were you thinking! I'm in love. Love... Listen to me, Romeo: Make a scene, and you die. Then you'll know what that means. Now close up already. It's open. Don't think about it. But you're so cute... When did you get back? I've been here all day. - Why? I can't. - Why? There were... complications. What complications? The kind that needs to be fixed immediately. Sounds terrible. Terrible? That asshole! I could kill him! No! - Shut up! What is it? I'm on a diet. Smells like 'Happy'. 'Happy'. Can't I go see a friend without being made an alcoholic? 'Happy', the perfume I gave you. - You know how it is with Isabel. You were with her? - No. No? - No. What? Did I get abducted by aliens? That's what Don Gambino wanted to know. What's the matter? You turned off your GPS. A bad day to get away. If my safety is that important to you, why don't you just get some guy to stay with me all day? How should this old bag protect me? It must be that stalker! No! Don't answer it! What is it? An Austrian 9mm Glock with dumdum bullets. And why such an expensive one from Austria? Just in case. In case of what? Go upstairs. What's wrong, honey? Nothing, little one. Get away from the window. Talk to me. I'm your wife. It's no use. It's gone. What's gone? - The problem. Give me a minute. Yes. Gabino. It's gone. We can turn on the lights. That's what I call a quick solution. Where were we? Won't you tell me what's wrong? What did you say? You never tell me anything. Just a small complication. Now I remember. You were talking about aliens! What's that? My new Springfield 1911 AL, 45mm. You will tell me... how the aliens are. What have you done? - Nothing. Nothing? No? - No. No probing? - No. If I was an alien I'd probe you. Come here! - What do you want? To probe you. - No! Something wrong? - No probing. Why not? - Last time I could hardly walk. Please... What's the gun for? I'm sorry. To force me? You would rape me? Hello. Which table would you like? The one in the back is free. A private room, please. - As you wish. Good evening. No, thank you. Cheers. Not so much, I've already had some. What you must think of me... I wasn't thinking about you. - That I came along so easily. Why did your sister send you here? A job interview. There you go. That's what I thought. We work, yes? Or... Of course. We check your manners, behaviour and how you act. Can I? Pregnac sauternes. So I should talk about me? Do you know what happened to me the other day? No. - A stranger was following me. My sister said it's my fault because my skirt's too short.. No, thank you. Such intense eyes. Don't look at me like that. Seriously, don't look at me like that. It makes me quite... My mother would go crazy. I'll pay for your cab. Alright. You live with your mother? And my Sister. Und wir haben einen Bruder, der ist bei der Marine. And your father? Are you the eldest? Middle. After Marie. You work for Don Simón. That's where I'll be too. It's a good job? He's never there. But his grandson is there on holidays. I know him. Well, he... he harasses my sister. She could press charges. - She knows. But she's in love. The cow should get pregnant, but she doesn't want to. That would bring more money, right? And your brother? Where does he get his money? My mother sent him to the navy. He's always doing stuff and bothering me and marie.. Your own brother? - No! Half-brother. Different dad. Thank god for that. Did you tell your mother? Better be quiet. My mother caught them in the act. What did she do? Well, she shipped him off to the navy. And you defended him? I was spying on him. And your sister? She's a jerk. She still yearns for him. Why are you looking at me like that? There's something in the wine, isn't there? I've had other drinks, like tequila, but... there's something with this one. I'm not sure, but... I'm feeling... Everything's spinning. Come. Let me help you. Stand up. Lift your arms. Lift your arms. Take a deep breath. Deeper. Deeper. Better? No. What are you doing? I can't get up. Must be the wine. Stop. Please don't. What is it? I'm very ordinary... Don't say that. The ugly duckling. You're an exotic fruit... I want to go to college, have nice things, meet important people, travel... What will you think of me when I work here... Excuse me? When you see me with the customers... What are you up to? Nothing. Just a job. You want to meet important people? Come here. We're playing Texas Hold'em. No Limit, every fifth card is a Joker. Big Blind's $10000 Big Blind, Small Blind is $5000. Do you recognize them? Here, take this. What? - For the taxi. But then you'll think... I won't think about you. Wait here. A little gift... Thank you, honey. When do you have time, sweetie? Shut up and play, you idiot. What a great spa. That's your house. You live here? Sometimes... during the holidays. What's that? There's a party at the Z club. Shall we go? How boring. You've never been there, have you? Not inside, no. Shall we go? My friends will never believe this. I'll have two Cosmopolitans. I love Cosmopolitans. Excuse me? I love Cosmopolitans. - Yes, Cospomolitans! You haven't had any? No. I mean, yes. On my sixteenth birthday. Honest! That's all they had. Hello... you were great. Where were you? On my way... Come on. This better be good. Did you miss me? You're a lesbian? Now who's the cheap one. I'm not cheap! Watch it! I'm not cheap. I don't understand them. I can't hear you. I'm not cheap! There's no need to shout. I'm an exotic fruit... Really? And you're not wearing any underwear! How thoughtful. Here, have another drink. You're trying to get her drunk? She just needs to cool off a bit. What? - An autograph? No. Yours. It's you, right? Who? - Let's go. It is you! What's going on here? What are you doing? Nothing. I'm just loosening up this cheap slut. Cheap sluts don't wear shoes like that. Bitch! Whay is it so hot here? Let me take this off. No. No. No! Not the shoes. They're Manolo Blahniks. It's embarrassing, all these gifts. Your school uniform is more embarrassing. You're like a beggar at Christmas. I'm poor. But it's not Christmas. Do you want to know my name? Do you want to know my real name? So, a false name? You have a stage name? What's your name? What's your name! Here. No. I don't know you. Sure you do. Names mean nothing. I didn't know you liked girls. I don't like girls. I like you. How awful. You knew it, curiosity nearly killed you. He's counting on me not having a crush on you. I'm not like that. Really not. No, really. No What is this music? Do you like Lakmé? Who? It's a French opera. French... It's a love story about a princess and her slave. Ine one scene, Lakmé and Malika are bathing toegther in a stream. What a coincidence. Malika. I like that name. Can I be called Malika? Is she the princess? Malika is the slave. That's what I thought. Would you still love me if... I was a real estate agent? What is that nonsense? If I didn't look like an actress? You don't look like one, you are one! You're only here, because you think I'm famous. You seel houses? Who are you? Your lover. Nothing more. Do you love me, Malika? Don't call me that! Take me home, will you? Won't you stay for breakfast, Malika? Enough with the stupid nickname! No breakfast either? At least pay for the taxi. My purse is at the bar. - And? My wallet is in it. Can you do me a favor? Bring me the bottle. Please. Wh kind of behavior is this. - Are you giving me a lecture, or what? Come. Come! I thought you wanted money pay for a ride, not to buy a taxi. You're over reacting! Give me the candle. I'm not your servant! - Nor am I your lover! No offense, but you're not very good in bed. Start saving up for your taxi. Save, and spruce it up a bit. Are we not friends anymore? We never were, Malika. We just used each other. Should I come over? You liked it? I did. I think you're very lovely. But for that price, I'd rather have someone with a little class. To be honest. Let's go. I'll see you out. Don't you want to pay? We agreed on 100! Drive! Quickly! Come on! As I entered the courtroom... I went to the judge and said... that if my lovfe for you is a crime... they should probably execute me. My love, why don't you love me? On the day of my execution... 5 bullets will kill me... and I will fall next to your body... so that I may die in your arms. Where are you going? Don't go. Come back to bed. At least say goodbye properly. Like a princess. What are you looking at? Why are you giving back the money? Because I had more fun than you. Please! It was my pleasure. And... do you have a boyfriend? How old are you? Guess. Since when... - Do I work here? You're getting an early start. The early bird catches the worm. What's the matter? It's sad... It's sad that at ytour age, nothing surprises you anymore. Meeting you surprised me. You know who I am? The most beautiful woman on TV. But you're even more beautiful in my bed. I would take you with me if I could. Like Pancho! Who is Pancho? Who is Francisco? A sailor who wants to get married. And you believe him? I dream about hm taking me away... Let me get you a picture. A picture? - To remember me by. I'll never forget you. You will forget me. Very soon. Never. Never... never will it be like this again. How? Like this. Come with me. You... Let me help. - No. Please. - No... No, princess, no. No, my little princess. Let's go! Your boss? What do you want? Señora, I want to marry Leocadia. Excuse me? God willing. She loves me. And I was transferred... Do you know what she does? She loves me. And you? Here I am... Leave. There you go. Thank you. Princess...
