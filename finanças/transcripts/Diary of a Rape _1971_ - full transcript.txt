Tuesday, August 24. When I woke up this morning, I suddenly imagined... that Helge had hidden somewhere in the apartment. I was terrified... because Mom and Dad could come home at any minute. It was like a nightmare. I had to take care of it... the situation with Helge. Then Jan called. He'd just returned from the country. He wanted me to meet him right away at the usual spot. Just like before. At first I wasn't going to go. But maybe I could talk to him about Helge. I think he might be able to help me. He's so nice. EXPOSED He'll understand everything. The police is searching for 17-year-old Lena Svensson... who's been missing since this morning. At the time of disappearance she was wearing a blue shirt... brown jeans and sneakers. She was last seen hitching a ride with a red Opel station wagon. Please contact the Stockholm police department... or the nearest local law enforcement... with any information regarding the missing person. The police suspect foul play. The police have set up roadblocks. Well, here's my turnoff. It's probably best if you try to hitch another ride. - Can I get a ride? - Sure, where are you going? Further up the road. Try to squeeze into the back with all that other stuff. - You can put your bag on the floor. - No, it's okay. You've got no luggage so it shouldn't be a problem. Okay. It's a good thing this isn't a sports car. Can you imagine? These roads aren't wide enough. Well, this one will get us there. It'll take us all the way up to the land of the midnight sun. That won't be a problem. Did you hear about the lady... who went to see a dentist in the United States? She had all of her teeth fixed. A couple of days later she noticed they were broadcasting. What? Sounds. She heard radio programming in her head. - That's not true. - The teeth were broadcasting. - Your making this up. - No, I'm not. Commercials and everything. So she went back to the dentist and told him... "I can't go on like this. I don't even like the programming." He investigated and poked around... but there wasn't much he could do. He finally discovered... that if she ate substances which produced acid in both the stomach and the mouth... it wouldn't sound as loud. Imagine - Stereo. Stereo teeth. You won't need a cassette player. That's not true. Sure it is. I read it in the paper. You can let me out up ahead. I'll just walk down the road to the cottage. We can drive you. It doesn't matter to us. We're just out for a spin. That's so nice of you. Just pull off behind the wood pile. Okay. You call this a road? It's a horse trail for Christ's sake. You need a tank to get through here. I didn't know it was so over grown. I noticed that. Maybe it's the wrong road. It might be. It doesn't matter. It leads somewhere. We've got a tent with us. I'm not afraid of deer or wolves. There are no wolves around here. - You don't know Lars. - Ulla should be quiet. What if this is the wrong road? It doesn't matter. You can stay in our tent. Or you can stay in the cottage. - Does anybody live there? - No, I don't think so. - Is it a big place? - Yes, it's very big. I'll be damned. See, I told you. What a beautiful place. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with this place. We're here, Lena. Come on. This is the right place, right? - Do you think the water's warm? - Sure it is. Do you want to go swimming? Huh? Last one in- You don't have a key? You don't know where the key is? No, but it's around here somewhere. Okay. You're sure it's the right house? Yes. That's right. It's usually over by the woodshed. We'll check up here. - I said, we'll check up here. - Here it is, Lena. - We've found it. - Hurrah. I knew it was around here somewhere. Great. Now we don't have to unpack the tent. Who does the cottage belong to? His name's Jan. Actually, it's his mothers. Okay. Are they coming? I mean, with a nice place like this they must come out here on occasion. They're usually here, but she's working now. Look. Blueberries. Do you want some? Is this guy Jan your boyfriend? Yes, I guess so. - Does he also work? - No, he's a mama's boy. - Mama's boy. - Yes. - Who's little girl are you? - No one's. - No one's? - No. - What are you thinking? - Nothing. Nothing? - It's cold. - That felt great. It was shallow. I almost dove into a branch. Darling? - You know what I've been thinking? - No. That we should have some wine after the swim. I agree. Then I'll get a bottle from the car. Do you want some, Lena? Yes, please. No, I'll go. I know where it is. He was insane. Dashing around Europe to all the casinos. At least I saw Stockholm. He proposed after two weeks. He proposed? Did you say yes or no? - You said yes, right? - You already know. It's wonderful here in Marrakech. Hopeyou are enjoying your summer job at the museum. We miss you. You should have come. We'll be back before you start school. I've seen a dress with tassels that would fit you perfectly. Take care. Love, Mom. Dad says hello. Sit up. Nice. Nice. There. Now lift your leg. How about this? Isn't this nice. Thanks. Is this good? - Like that. - Wonderful. That's great. Wonderful. Lars! - He's probably by the car. - He's probably hiding. Hi there. - Did you make the coffee? - Yeah. Nice. - There you are. - Hello. How childish ofyou. - You look great today. - I know. I was in the tree looking at the view. I think it was childish of you to hide. What the hell? There's a car. Who could that be? - My clothes are at the house. - So our ours. - I'll go get them. - Good. You do that. What's the meaning of this, Lena? Who are they? How dare you break into the cottage? I thought you'd be here. - But you can't do whatever you want. - Take it easy. They could be anybody. - There's no harm done. - No. Imagine if it was my mom instead of me. - Oh, come on. - What the hell would she think? Why does it matter? If it bothers you, we'll just leave. - There's nothing more to discuss. - Yes, do that! Get lost! -Jan, take it easy. We haven't- - Shut your mouth! Let's go. I ought to give you the treatment, short stuff. Come on, let's go. Did we leave anything inside? - No, but we could do the dishes. - Screw that. Lars! Lena! Lena! Why don'tyou ride with him. That way we'll be rid of him. He's going to kill somebody. Say hi to the mama's boy. Why did you come after me? Because I love you. But you hit me yesterday. Of course I got ticked off when you told me about Helge. You won't listen to me, Jan. Were you going to run away with them? Yeah, you were so childish. You just don't get it. - Do they? - They were nice. You left that damn Helge also, right? So what? Where are you going? To town. - Can't we go back to the cottage? - Shut up. Are you jealous? How in the hell am I supposed to tell you anything? - I don't want to hear it. - So I'm supposed to be quiet? You couldn't explain it if you tried. I want help. It's so difficult. - It's what I want, but- - Why did you do it? - I wanted to. - You wanted to? Yeah, so what? - Why shouldn't I? - Don't you understand? No. Yes. It's not like that, Jan. Can't things be the same as they were before? How could they? Nothing's changed. Yes, it has. I don't want it to. Do you want to come up? Don't bother. Lena, why didn't you come to the party yesterday? I missed you. Helge. PS. I love you. Why didn't you come to the party yesterday? I missed you. Why didn't you come to the party yesterday? I missed you. How are you? Hello. Jan. Jan? One moment. - Hello. -Jan, I just wanted to talk to you. You're the only one I can talk to. Jan. You have to come over. You've got to stop seeing that damn Helge. I think I love you. Think - I don't know. Just promise you'll come over. Immediately. Yeah, okay. Bye. I'm glad you came,Jan. Jan, there's something I have to tell you. This summer when you were at the cottage. I was all alone... and that's when I met Helge. He had parties every night with a bunch of weird people. It was horrible. He hit me several times. You know that picture, and several others that he took - He threatened to use them. I think you could be kinder... towards my guests. Maybe I should sleep with them. If they want to. You wouldn't want your mother or principal to see these pictures. You better do as I say. We'll keep these pictures to ourselves, right? We had fun when we took them, didn't we? Hi. - What's your name? - Lena. I don't think you should be here. Leave now. Nobody will see you. Helge will. I think you should let Lena leave. Lena is mine. They were insane. You understand that I was scared... with Helge being the way he was. I ran through town half naked. What? He chased you? I was too scared after what had happened. - How did you get home? - I told you I ran. The whole way? Yes, and then I called you. - Was that the same day- - Yes, the day we met. -And you- -And you slapped me. It was stupid. I regret it. You seemed so strange and you left. You were the only one I could trust. And I had thought- I had thought we'd be together yesterday. I'm not going back to work. I only have three days left anyway. And Mom will be home soon. But if it was- I mean, Helge. And the pictures. I have to get them, Jan. Don't think I'm that kind of person. I know you're not, Lena. What should I do? - Should I- - Helge would just laugh at you. Just explain it to your mom. She can- I mean- She'll understand, right? Jan, do you love me? Yes. I should never have gone to the cottage with Mom. Then this might never have happened. I've been thinking of you all summer. You and your stuffed birds. You love me. Lena. - Would you like something to eat? - Sure, like what? Ants. Beans. And grape tonic. - Have you had this before? - No, never. Lena? Wake up. Lena? Somebody's here. No. I heard somebody. BIOLOGICAL MUSEUM Ms. Lena, wait a second. - Have you been sick? - Yes. You have to call to let us know if you're sick. You've been gone two days. You're my assistant and I can't be without my assistant. I don't have time to run around looking for you. I have better things to do. I'm taking a break. Hi, darling. Hi. - Have you been sick? - No. I went to the country for a while to think things through. What's bothering you? You don't know? Everything about you and Jan and what will happen. But I love you. That doesn't make it any easier for me. Why did you send me that picture? My Mom could have seen it. Mom? I thought she was out of town. What did you mean by that? I don't know. I missed you terribly. I was scared you would leave me. So I took those pictures- it was stupid of me- as blackmail. Forgive me, Lena. I know itwas stupid. I wasn't thinking. Can I have the pictures? If you'd feel safer with them. And the negatives? Sure. Sure. I don't have them on me, but I could get them from home. How about we get together tonight and I'll bring them when I pick you up? Helge, I'm scared of you. Scared? Yes. You do things I love and you show me things I enjoy. It gives me nightmares. You know that. You hurt me. I don't know what to do. But if I give you the pictures, you'll know I don't want to hurt you. I love you. Promise me that we can be together. My boss was angry at me today. Really? Why? Because I didn't show up yesterday. No, no. I should leave. - You're off at 6:00, right? - Yes. - The pictures? - You'll get them, my frightened little lamb. - Good-bye. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi. - Mom was going crazy. - Was she mad at you? I'm lucky she let me leave the house. Isn't that up to you? I would have left even if she tried to lock me up. When do you get off? - Good-bye. - Bye. - Want to go to the movies? - To see what? I don't know. Well... Excuse me, miss. I beg your pardon. How long are you open? - Until 6:00. - 6:00? Great, then I might have time to take a look up top. - Sure. - Thanks. What an idiot. - Was that Jan? - It doesn't concern you. Do you have the pictures? I promised. There you are. - You don't have a key? - No, Mom took it. - Hi. - Good day. - This must be Lena? - Yes. Jan has told me all about you. We've spoken on the phone by the way. Don't you look pretty, my dear? Jan, you've got good taste. I'm prepared to overlook what happened this evening. So let's just forget about it. Jan and I have agreed not to discuss it any further. So it's forgotten. But of course I worry when he's gone all night long. That's what mom's do. - Yes. - Come in, dear. Come in. Lena, please forgive the mess... but I had no idea that Jan was bringing home his girl today. Did you go to the movies,Jan? I suggested to Jan that you go to the movies and then swing by for coffee afterwards. This is lovely. You probably have it lovelier at home. Well, I'll go put on the coffee. Make yourself at home, Lena dear. - That's some mom you've got. - Yeah, she talks too much. - I'll ask her to go out with Maggie. - Maggie? - That's our dog. - Okay. Have you taken the mutt out? No, I'll take care of it. That way you can talk in peace and quiet. Jan, the coffee is almost ready. Show that you're a nice host and serve some coffee to your girl. Okay. I'll see you youngsters in about 15 minutes. - Good-bye. - Come on, sweetie. Let's go. Why did we leave the museum in such a hurry? What do you mean? Was something wrong? Be serious now, Lena. Haven't you noticed? That's what's wrong with me. I'm always too serious. I feel too little and know too much. Don't be silly. What's with the envelope you got? The man who showed up was Helge. Helge? Yes, he promised to give me the pictures. How did it go? I threatened to report him to the police. And he gave you the pictures? Yes, of course. Do you want to see them? I don't know. Do you want me to see them? Sure, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Why did you do it? Because it was fun. But you said that he had beaten you and - I said that yesterday. You lied? No. It was like that yesterday. Today I have the pictures. What an imagination you have. Do you think I look good? I guess you look like this. You don't like me? I do. But not like this. Let's throw the pictures away. So you can have them? We'll burn them. What are you doing? - We're having a fire. - In the middle of summer. What pictures are these? What kind of a whore have you brought home? Lena, I love you. I have to speak to you. I have nothing to say to you. I'm coming up. Helge, can't we meet tomorrow for lunch, instead? You have to explain why you ran away. I'm coming up. You can't come up. Excuse me. Excuse me, would you let me in? I'm being expected. - Is that so? - Thanks. We should have checked into a motel. Then we wouldn't be so tired. You shouldn't complain. You've been resting all night long. Help me with the bags instead. No, they're too heavy. Take your bag then and go up and go to bed. - I'll take care of this. - Yeah, yeah. Do you want help with the luggage? Lena isn't home. You don't have to wake her. I found the keys. Should I unlock it? She isn't in her room. It's so nice to be home. Look, they've eaten the ants. I can't believe they could. - Do you want some? - No, I don't want any. - There's Lena. - Lena? Lena? We're home. - Hi, Lena. - Hi, Lena. How has everything been? It's been good. - How are you? - I'm fine. How about Jan? I'm sure he's fine. What have you been up to? Nothing. We saw a beautiful dress. But we hardly had any money left. It had long tassels. - Are we going to buy one here? - Near all these pornographic pictures? What do you think of pictures like that? They're everywhere. Nobody knows any better anymore. Imagine if I'd tried on that dress in the window. I'll stay with the cab. There's Jan. Hi,Jan. - Good afternoon. - So how have things been? It's been good. You should come over for dinner sometime. Don't you think, Lena? Wouldn't that be nice? It's been a long time since we last saw you. - You promised to meet me. - I just don't know what you like. Do you feel better now that you've got the pictures? Yes, I do. I've got to go to roll call. Can't you skip it? No, it'll only take 15 minutes. Can't we meet later? Last time you ran off with Jan. This time I promise to return. I promise. Marrakech was wonderful. It was so beautiful. It was almost like a dream. But the trip home was really a pain. It took a lot longer than we thought. Well, I hope to see you soon, Jan. Say hi to your parents. I better get going. Bye.
