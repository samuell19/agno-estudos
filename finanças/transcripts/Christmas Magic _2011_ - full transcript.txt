He said he would call Lynette as soon as he got off the phone with me, so she definitely knows. I'd give a million dollars to be there to see the look on her face. Uh...you have to pay inside. Uh hey, Alex I'm just at a gas station can I give you a call back? Great. Think they take credit card? Yeah, sure. I'm going that way, we'll find out together. From the city? How can you tell? No one around here drives a fancy car like that. It's a present for myself. Oh-- I'm on two. Gonna have to wait a minute for the credit card. The machine is...updating. No problem. Got your cards out yet? Ugh-- No. Don't. do. cards. Or trees... or mistletoe. I don't even hang up my stocking on Christmas Eve. That's a little Scroogey, isn't it? Oh-- Ebenezer's my hero. But you just bought yourself a car for Christmas. No. That was a gift to myself for a good year at work. Oh. Congratulations. Alright, it's up. You can pay now. Thanks. Those phones are a real lifeline for you kids aren't they. Don't know how I'd do my job without it. What do you do? I'm an event planner. I work with the big agency. We, uh-- Do promotional events for companies. You know, like movie premieres or charity concerts, that kind of thing. Sounds interesting. Has its moments. -- Oh-- Excuse me. Hi, Lynette. Look sweetie, um, I'm just finishing up at a gas station. Why don't I give you a call back when I'm on the road? Perfect. Friend? No. The competition. She stole a contract from me like 6 months ago. She's been gloating all over town ever since. Well now, it is payback time. And I'm going to enjoy every minute of it. You know-- You might not want to talk on the phone while your driving. A cold snap like this, you get black ice on the roads. You don't see it until it's too late. Yeah. I take this route all the time in conditions a lot worse than this. It was nice talking to you. My pleasure. Please-- be careful out there. I will. Where the-- Ugh-- Hello? Hello?? Is anyone- Oh! Sir, hi! Um-- Oh. We've met before-- Um, at the gas station. That's right, Carrie. How do you... know my name? I warned you about talking on the phone while driving. Hello? Lynette, it's Carrie. I just wanna find out what you told him. You never could have won that contract without lying through your teeth. Come on. Is it really that hard for you to accept defeat? You stole my client from me and I promise you I am gonna make you pay for it. So what did you offer Collin's to make him switch? Kickbacks? Personal favors? Carrie: No. He just said he wanted something new. Something he hadn't seen a million times before. You know, something young, and hip and interesting, so he accepted my proposal. Oh. That is rich coming from you. Every idea you ever had you stole from somebody else. You know if your father wasn't such a big shot in the art world, you never would have even been hired. You're gonna fall one day and when you do I'm gonna be there laughing. Remember that. Since our last conversation, there's been...a major change in your existence. Yeah... I, uh, gotta kick myself out of this dream. Um... I'm afraid it's not a dream. Who are you? My name is Henry. I'm here to guide you. Wait, you mean I'm-- Is this Heaven? This is Central Park. Heaven is in Central Park? We have an assignment for you. An assignment? Like work? Whatever happened to eternal rest? Well, we all have to pitch in. Keep things moving in the right direction. It's what angels do. Like jury duty. Like angel duty. Ok-- So look, um-- So first of all-- I'm an angel. Shouldn't I have wings or something? Oh, trust me you wouldn't want them. They snag on everything. It's murder trying to get in a compact car. Wait a minute. If you knew about the accident... why didn't you tell me? I warned you to watch the roads and stay off the phone. That's all I'm permitted to do. First rule is angels can't interfere with free will. So...that's it? My life is over? I didn't even get a chance to do anything. You had a successful career. You bought yourself that big old luxury automobile to celebrate, remember? Yeah, but-- I never got married. I never had a family. I mean I never even really have a boyfriend. Everyone goes through a regret stage when they first pass over. Yeah, but most people will probably have people who are sorry that they died. Your file says your father is still alive. Yeah, right. I'm sure he'll make it to the funeral. If he's not too busy on a buying trip in Europe. You two don't get along? I haven't spoken to him in months. Does my father... know? Yes. The police contacted him. Was he even sad? All the questions about your father will be answered after you've accomplished your mission. Well-- Trust me. You'll get though this stage pretty quickly. Hm? Besides, we're giving you an amazing opportunity. Look, you know, I just lost my life, so do you think I could maybe have a minute to grieve about it? Oh, don't be a a drama angel. Life is never ending. Somebody needs your help desperately. Come on-- Can't we at least fly or something? New York is the best walking city in the world. Ok, so what is this assignment? I'm taking you to him. Him? It's a guy? Yes. He needs guidance and help. What do I do? Guide him and help him. Hello. Hi. I'm new at this. What do I do?? I just knock on his door and I say, "hi, I'm here to help and guide you?" It'll come to you as you go along. But there are some rules you have to follow. Right-- Free will. That's the biggest one. Number 2, you can't tell anyone you're an angel. Secret identity. Third, you can't contact anyone from your previous life. Now matter how great the temptation. You do this and you'll get in to Heaven. Come on. It's right over here. Can people see us? Yes. Oh! And they can feel us. I just thought since everyone was ignoring us-- It's New York remember? Right. So um are we gonna stop and have a bite to eat first? Your assignment owns this restaurant. There he is. He looks so sad. His name is Scott and he's fallen on hard times. His restaurant is failing and he may have to close it in a few days. Your job is to convince him that life is worth living. Whoa, hey. I'm not really great at pep talks. I was thinking more along the lines of turning his restaurant around. Make him feel like a success. Oh. You mean like promoting his business? That's no problem. I mean, that's what I do. Easy peasy. Did I mention there's a deadline? Does everything in Heaven have a catch? How long do I have? December 24th. Three weeks from today. Ok. So I have until Christmas. I could work with that. It's good, uh-- Maybe I could use the holidays to inspire him, you know the whole sentimental nonsense. He hates Christmas. Of course he does. I'm taking off. Wait, um-- How do I find you if I need you? Don't worry. I'll be around. This is as important to me as it is to you. Henry, wait! Are you sure about this? I mean...I'm a newbie. Carrie-- Everything happens for a reason. We have faith in you. Hello? Hello. Hi! Hi! Um, are you open? Hi, yes-- we just opened. Please- take a seat. There you go-- Sorry, Scott, there was a delay with the subway, we sat in the tunnel for half an hour. It's alright, Rita-- Just get changed, we have a customer. A customer? Yes-- Right! Uh...hi! Would you like to hear today's special? Um...sure. Scott, what's today's special?! Chicken picante and a bed of rice. Um, that sounds great. I'll have that. Ok, great! I'll get the coffee. You get changed. Yeah, yeah-- Hey, Rita, put in a jazz CD-- Here's your coffee. Thank you. Cream? No. Ok. Rita: Okay! You asked me to remind you to put up the Christmas decorations. That's right-- Customers expect it. Yeah, I know, I know-- Ok, good-- Most people enjoy decorating for Christmas. Yeah, well most people have a reason to celebrate. What, you don't? Well, look around-- I don't know... I find that hard to believe. Yeah. Me too-- Okay! Here you go, hun. Wow! That was fast. Always is. Enjoy! Scott: What is this? Rita: Huh... ...I don't know. You sure you don't want to do this? You're doing a good job. Daddy! Hey, there you are! Ugh! Well, little miss Abby received an outstanding report card today. Is that right? Yeah... Whoa! I think somebody deserves a home made cookie, huh? Don't worry Betsy. I got one for you too. You know I can't resist. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Hey, Rita--- Got it! She's good. Mmmhmmm-- Betsy: Here's the deal. I got got a call from my daughter last night. Is everything ok? Oh yeah, no-- Everything's wonderful-- Actually, she's been offered a job-- Um, but she has to start right away-- Good cookie? The best. It's my Grandpa's special recipe. What's your name, kid? Abigail, but everyone calls me Abby. What's yours? Carrie. Everyone calls me Carrie. I'm sorry, but I just-- It's my grandkids, you know? And I just can't let my daughter down. Listen, I totally understand. You've been more than generous with your time, Betsy. Thanks. Abby, guess what? You get to hang with me today. Dad, it's so boring here. Hey, we'll make it fun I promise. Tell you what, I'd like to take my cookie to go. Sure! Actually, I'll get one of those too. For dessert. Best in town. That's the word on the street. Thanks, dear. See you later. Okay-- Hey, chocolate face. Go wash up. Wow, it's really coming down out there. Is that why the lunch time crowd is so light? Yeah, well usually there's a few more regulars. Well, I certainly don't want to go out in that. Would you, um... Mind if I hung out here for a bit? No problem, I'll get you a refill. Great! So is Betsy your babysitter? No, neighbor-- And thankfully she's great with kids. I can't really afford child care right now. Well, maybe since I'm snowbound, I could help out a bit. Oh. That's ok. You don't have to do anything. It's not like your taking up a table for somebody else. Hey, Abby! Wanna help me put up some Christmas decorations? Awesome! Really, you don't have to do anything. It's fine. I don't mind. Let someone help you out. It's Christmas. Scott: Okay. Rita: You can help me with these napkins. Scott: Great! Here you go. Enjoy. Thanks. Nice work. Can I ask you a question about the restaurant? Sure. Was today typical of the number of people you get in here? Well, to be honest, I think the snow kept a lot of people away. Let's see here-- We did 15 covers. Normally we do about double that. Hm... Ever thought about putting more promotion into the place? Promotion costs money which I don't have because I don't have enough business, which is probably why I can't promote the place. Well, I mean, this is just a thought, but what if I help out? I'm an event planner, which is basically the same thing as promoting a business. Thanks, but like I said, I don't have the money. It's ok. I recently left my agency and I'm starting out on my own. This could be a good trial run for me. That's kind of you, I just wouldn't feel right you working for nothing. Then what about this: how about we look at the books in a month and you can give me 10% of whatever increase in business is due to my efforts. Alright. That sounds fair. Great. Well, we have a deal. I'm gonna make this place famous. You'll see. Well look, I guess we should shove off-- Little one here-- Hey sweetie, time to wake up. Come on. We gotta go. Put your jacket on, alright? I had fun today. Think Abby and I might have a future in decorating. Yeah, well you guys did a great job. Thanks again for looking after her. Oh, no it's my pleasure. Come on-- Which way you headed? Uh, just up the street. Okay, well, me too. Maybe we could walk you out. I'd like that. Come on-- I'm Carrie Blackford, by the way. Oh, Scott Walker. I'm sorry-- Now we're not strangers anymore. No. I guess we're not. I'll grab her bag. Okay, thank you-- After you. Kinda got my hands full. You know I'm kind of at loose ends right now. So, if you're looking for a babysitter, maybe I could take care of Abby. I don't think I could ask you to do that. No. It's ok. It'll be fun. Actually, I had a really great time today. I'd always wanted to have a little girl of my own someday. Well, can't you still? No. I'm sorry. It's ok. I'm told the regrets phase is temporary. Good. Well, this is me. Oh, um, so what do you think? I'm gonna be honest with you. Until Betsy gets back it'd be a really big help. Great. Let's plan on it then. Ok. Look, are you sure I can't walk you home? No, I'm fine, I'm just-- Besides you gotta get that little one to bed. OK, well, I'll see you tomorrow then. Thank you. Have good night. You too. Night-- Something's happened-- I saw my father. You didn't--- No. He didn't see me. He was coming out of a flower shop. A big bouquet of yellows tulips. They're my favorites. Must of cost a fortune at this time of year. There's a reason were not allowed to contact loved ones after we passed. It'd be just as difficult for us as it is for them. The pain and the suffering don't stop once we leave this Earth. You know I'm sad, but-- Even more than that, I'm just...regretful-- that I didn't try harder to reach out to him. That I wasn't a better daughter. I'm sure he has as many regrets as you do. I guess that's the kicker isn't it. We don't appreciating things until they're gone. You know what's funny? Spending time with Scott and Abbey today I felt... I felt more alive than I did when I was alive. How is that possible? Well-- Did you ever think about being alive when you were alive? No...of course not. Well, now you have perspective. Okay-- Well, I guess now all I have to do is go home and change out of these clothes. Nuh-uh. Against the rules. What? No. No. I have a two bedroom apartment. I changed the bigger bedroom in to a closet. I need my clothes. Don't worry. I'll take care of that. You cannot have contact with anything or anyone from your living stage. Who's picking up Abbey from school this afternoon? I found someone else. It's that cutie that was here all afternoon yesterday, right? Her name is Carrie and yes, she's offered to help take care of Abby. A-ha! You should go out with her. Oh yeah. Single dad, working long hours at a restaurant, I'm a great catch. Sweetheart, you're selling yourself short. If I didn't have my Stan, I'd jump on you like a bee on honey. Oooo-- Thank god for Stan. Oh, nice! That's very nice-- Carrie: Good afternoon! Oh, if it isn't our interior designer. I helped! And her junior partner. Do you like it? Oh, the place rivals the North Pole. Too bad there aren't more people here to enjoy it. Rita, table three needs a fill up. Okay. How you doing, sweetie? You hungry? Not yet. No? How about you? Uh, famished. Yeah? What can I get ya? Um...I'll do the chicken paprikash. Good choice. I'll be right back. You got some homework? Yeah. Well, not really just some coloring. For Christmas? Yeah-- Nice! Maybe you can do some other colors too. Here you go. Here you go-- Oh, thanks. What about you little lady. You hungry yet? Yeah. Do you wanna come back to the kitchen? We'll do up something special. Sure! Alright. Let's go. Could I come and watch? Yeah, sure, if you like. Great... What in the name of everything mouthwatering and wonderful is that? It's BBQ like my dad used to make. It's Abby's favorite food. Here-- Try some. It's hot. Mmmmmm! Oh my god. This is amazing. Oh my god, I've never tasted anything like this in my life. What's in it? Well, my dad used to always say the secret ingredient was-- Love. Was your dad a chef? No, he shoulda been. He was bus driver, but he also made the best BBQ in town. Scott, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Eat up, honey. What is it? Why don't serve that instead of what's on the menu now? Why? You don't like what I'm serving now? Um... Well, yesterday I had the chicken picante. You know how picante means spicy, sharp, and hot? Yeah. Well, it wasn't. And the chicken paprikash tastes just like the chicken picante. Which is not a good thing. Ok. Look-- I'll admit that the food can be a little bland sometimes, but it's just, when I bought this place, I promised the regulars I wouldn't change anything and, well, I didn't. Ok, but, you can make that your special. Serve it alongside the blah. The regulars keep me afloat and if the regulars want bland, then I give them bland. Yeah, but Scott, I mean who wouldn't love this? It's tender, I mean it melts in your mouth. And the taste is just amazing. I mean, you could make a fortune off of this. I just don't think they'll go for it. Try it. Take a chance. I mean, no one can taste this BBQ and not want more. Right Abby? That's an awesome idea, dad. This is the best. Yeah, I know you like it. Maybe. I just-- Well, let me take a look at my dad's other recipes that he left me back home. There's more where this came from? Oh, yeah there's more. Betsy: he must be around here somewhere--- There he is! Hey guys! Hi Daddy! Thanks Betsy for taking care of her. No worries. It wasn't far for me to go. How are your grandkids? Oh, they're lovely. Daddy, I drew some pictures in art class. Great. Why don't you put them on the fridge and I'll be there in a minute and see ya. Ok-- Hmmmm-- Whatcha doing? I'm going through some of my dad's old recipes. Thinking about changing things up at the restaurant a bit. Oh... About time. You too? You know how when you offer me lunch I always say I'm on a diet? Yeah. I haven't been on a diet since college. Maybe she was right. Is this Carrie we're talking about? How do you know? She's all Abby talks about. Really? Daddy, don't you want to see my drawings? Of course I do, sweetheart. I'm gonna scoot. I'll see you later. Abby: Bye Betsy. Thanks Betsy. Alright little miss artist, let's see these magnificent masterpieces. Ok. This is what I think dinosaurs would do if they were still alive. Aw, the rolling reptiles. I think I saw this before on the Flintstones. And that's us on Christmas morning. Is that an angel? It's Carrie, but she doesn't have her wings yet. Why did you draw Carrie as an angel? Because she is an angel, dad. Alright, fine. She's an angel and I'm the tickle monster. And I'm gonna tickle my little girl! Who doesn't get ready for bed and brush her teeth! Come on! An angel-- Scott: Here you go. This isn't what I ordered. I know Ms. McCarty. It's something new I wanted you to try. No charge. I ordered the chicken picante. I know and you'll get that, I just wanted you to taste this beef first. I want chicken picante. I don't like spicy food. Just have a taste. I think you'll really like it. I ordered chicken picante like I always do. I know, but could you just please just try it? I don't eat beef. It clogs me. Oh. Ok-- Well, we wouldn't want that would we? Let's get Mrs. McCarty her chicken picante. Hi, sorry, we're not actually opened for viewing yet. I know. I read about your opening tomorrow, congratulations. You have some... intriguing pieces. Thank you. It's actually my first exhibition and uh--- Yeah...um-- About that would you like a little bit of friendly advice maybe? My father is an art dealer so I know a thing or two about what works and what doesn't. Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, please! To be honest, I've just been worried to death. Awww... Ok. What's your catch phrase? Sorry, my what? Ok. Every exhibition needs a catch phrase so people know what to talk about he next day. You need to tell people what they're seeing. Looking at this exhibition, I would call these works.... Um... I got it-- The new American classic. But that doesn't really make sense. New things can't be classic. Right, so, we're being ironic, get it? I guess.... Ok. What's your name? Danny Bellmore. No. Not anymore. Now, it's Dimitri. No last name. Just Dimitri. But nobody's going to believe that my name is actually Dimitri. Maybe not, but they will believe you re-invented yourself as someone hip just like them. Now, how have the RSVP's been? Oh, uh... Pretty lousy. That's good. Call everyone back and tell them you're very sorry, but you're over booked and they couldn't possibly attend. That'll guarantee people show up. Now, um...what about a caterer? Uh-uh-- No, no. I, I didn't think I was going to provide food--- Dimitri you have to. Art critics get paid squat, gallery openings are what they live for and besides, a stuffed critic is a happy critic. So, let's think about this. The New American Classic... I got it. I got it. What's classic american cuisine? I know what you're thinking-- BBQ. And I just happen to know someone who has a new take on BBQ. Shall I give you his name? Yes, yes. Scott! I have fantastic news! Great cause I have 200 pounds of beef I don't know what to do with. 200 pounds of beef that you're gonna need to cater Dimitri's Art gallery opening. Right, Dimitri? Dimitri. Oh, right! That's me. Yes, hi, hi-- I need...a caterer. A caterer specializing in BBQ to serve the tastemakers of the city people who know restaurant critics. Oh ok. Yeah-- Carrie said that this was an appropriate fee. I need finger food for about...400. 400-- Yeah, I think we could probably do it for that. I am so lucky that you just--- she just dropped out of the clear blue sky. I'm an angel alright. So, I guess I will see you tomorrow. Yes! I will see you tomorrow. Okay-- Thank you. Ok, that was a miracle. Congratulations! Oh! Congratulations-- See, when you follow you heart good things happen. I guess-- I mean finger food for 400? Oh boy I'm gonna need help here. You got me. Alright. Everybody's hands clean? Yep! Ok, great. Let's do this! I will assemble the spice mix. Abby, you're gonna rub the mix into the meat. Okey doke. Alright, Rita you gotta slice. Make sure it's about an inch thick, ok? Got it. And Carrie, you're gonna be on skewers. Just make sure they don't bunch up too much. It'll burn that way. Got it. Betsy, I'd like you to package the skewers. Ok, well, let's start! Carrie: This is messy work-- Good work with the marinade, Abby. Pretend it's play-dough. Just get right in there-- That a girl. Okay, perfect-- Mix it up-- Are they ready already-- No, not yet-- I'm ready to turn vegan. Thank you all for you hard work. I couldn't have done it without you. I thing somebody's ready for bed. Yeah... I have a lot left to do. Betsy, do you mind? No, don't worry about it, I'll take her home. Okay-- Thanks Betsy. I owe ya. I better go. Stan's gonna be hungry. Yeah, I guess it is getting late-- Thanks Rita! Goodnight, guys! How 'bout you? You hungry? I could eat. You know what? Me too. I'll fix us up something. Wow! A man cooking me dinner. I must have died and gone to heaven. Okay-- So where'd you go to cooking school? Uh...I didn't. I, uh... studied music. You're a musician? Used to be. I saw the piano out there. Looked like it hadn't been played in a couple of years. No. It's, uh... been a while. Hey, do you want a glass of wine? Yes, please. Ok, coming up. Carrie: So, what happened? Scott: Well, let's just say that things didn't turn out the way I planned. No, they never do. No. They don't. I was playing gigs at restaurants, you know, standard cocktail stuff with jazzy twists so I wouldn't lose my mind. Then after a while I started learning quite a bit about the restaurant business-- And then I met Katie. Your wife? Yeah. Eventually. We had Abby and everything was going pretty good. We were struggling financially of course, but we knew we'd get back on track soon enough. Can I ask what happened? It'll be 5 years ago this Christmas Eve-- I was setting up the tree at our apartment. It was for Abbey, but she was too young to know the difference so I guess it was kind of for us too. And, um-- Katie was coming back from picking up some ornaments, I never had a tree before-- And it was... Snowing and the... the roads were icy. She just crossed the street-- And this car was going faster than it should have been. It was over in a second. I'm so sorry. Funny thing is-- There's a knock at the door and I-- I thought it was Katie. I thought she was just joking around with me, that she wanted me to come to the door so she could kiss me under the mistletoe. But it, uh... it wasn't her. So ever since then, Christmas hasn't been my favorite time of year. You know, I go through the motions for Abby's sake, but I'm just kind glad when the whole holiday season is over. Yeah. I can imagine. So then suddenly, I was a single dad, the old tip jar wasn't gonna pay the bills, um-- I was playing at this place on a regular basis and I found out the owner was gonna retire... so I put in an offer. And I got it at a good price. But you just gave up your music? There wasn't really much to sing about. Would you play something for me now? No. No, I just-- No-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-- It's alright. It's just a-- It's just a part of my life that, uh... Is over. That's all. Right. Well...thank you... for this. Yeah...sure. Um, I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Carrie-- Thanks... for everything. It was my pleasure. Scott: Morning, Rita. Rita: Good morning. Don't tell me you spent the night here. No. Carrie and I had a quick dinner then I went home. Alone? What do you think? Hmm-- I must be getting old. Besides the obvious, why do you say that? OK, smart guy. You can laugh, but I have a pretty good eye for when people click and you two are sending up all sorts of signal flares. Well, your signals are getting crossed because this is a strictly business relationship. That's it. Nope. Nope. I'm sorry, but I'm never wrong about these things. Look, she's not interested in me and I don't have the time or money to be interested in her, okay? So can we just let it go? I could just smack you-- Don't let her go! You'll never meet anyone else like her! Would you stop? Ask her to go for a walk! Take a look at the Christmas lights. No! I mean the worse that can happen is you get a chance to talk about business and you know, maybe, who knows? The best will happen. Alright. Just to shut you up, I will ask her to go on a walk. Yeah! Okay! Now we're talking, huh? And I'd like a raise. Never gonna happen. Okay-- Alright, top 3 things you don't like about Christmas. Oh, okay... Um, number 1, during the 12 days of Christmas when everyone sings 5 golden rings really loud, then they pause like you're supposed to give them an award or something. Um, fruit cake, which comes from god knows where and sucks all the moisture out of your mouth. Oh. I know-- Ugh, and secret Santa where your supposed to spend money you don't have buying people you don't like, things they don't want I mean, what's with that? Exactly, right? Ok, you-- Three things-- Ok. Let's see-- The stupid little drummer boy, I mean who thinks playing a drum in a baby's ear is a great Christmas present? Alright, ruining perfectly good food by dying it red and green to be festive and trying to explain to Abby that Santa comes down the chimney without getting burnt to a crisp. Okay, I know this is gonna contradict everything I've ever said about Christmas, but I kind of like the decorations. I think the lights are pretty. You're like Abby. She loves the lights. Every time we come here, she just stands underneath them and spins around. She thinks it makes the whole world shine. It kinda does. What do you think? Um-- Not the whole world just-- Just you. No... What is it? I...can't. What's wrong? I just- I have a phone call that I- I promised. You can use my cell-- No, um-- It's not a phone call, it's- A meeting. And I promised. And um, I'm late. Well, I can get you wherever you need to go. I'm so sorry-- But I'll see you tomorrow. Alright-- Catering huh? Very nice. I hadn't thought of that. Why didn't you tell me about his wife? Does it matter? Of course it matters. Why? Because it explains why the restaurant has been in such a slump. I mean, businesses are just reflections of their owner's personalities. He doesn't need psycho-analysis, he needs business advice. Well that's- I just- I didn't know that he'd been through so much. Carrie, focus on your assignment. You get his life restarted the trauma will take care of itself. Yeah but-- No buts. You only have two days left. You think I'd be able to spend Christmas day with them? You don't even like Christmas. Neither does he. I know. I just- I don't know, I think this time might be different. It's like you said-- I have perspective now. What's this really about? I just want to spend one Christmas with a normal family. Before I pass over. And I mean suddenly there's this family that I actually want to spend it with. I mean-- Is that too much to ask? You sure that's all? Well... There is a form I could submit. Really?? I just need twenty-four hours. Just until the end of Christmas day. Alright, I'll try to get you Christmas day but I can't promise. Thank you! Alright... Hey Rita- Who's playing the piano? He asked if it was alright and I thought- I told you I don't like anyone playing the piano. It's Christmas Scott, the customers are enjoying it. Are you ready for a night of fun? Yeah! Where's your dad? I think he's still getting ready. Oh-- Dad! You look like a movie star. Thanks, sweetheart. Hi-- You do look great. Thank you. I- I didn't think you'd come tonight. Well I wasn't gonna leave you stranded. It's a big night for you. Thank you. So listen- I'll talk to Betsy on my way out and let her know that you're here. I left some money for pizza for you guys. Great-- Pizza! Okay honey wish me luck. I'm gonna make lots of contacts and try to turn our restaurant around. Dad you're gonna do fantastic. Listen thanks for setting everything up. Oh no problem. You really do look great. Thanks. Good luck. Okay- I won't be late. Goodnight, sweetheart. Bye, Dad. Bye-- What? You like him. As a friend. More than a friend. I can tell. You're eight. What do you know? I know you're an angel. How do you know that? How come nobody else does? I don't know. I think... Maybe you kids just spend more time looking at the world. Once you grow up... stuff just gets in the way. Then I never want to grow up. Don't say that. There are a lot of wonderful things about being a grown up. Besides you can still look for special things if you want to. Okay. Then I'll grow up but I'll never stop looking. That sounds like a good plan. Um... so about me being an angel- You um... You've kept that a secret, right? Duh. People can't handle that kind of information. Do you have to go back to Heaven soon? In a little bit. Can you spend Christmas with us?? I don't know maybe- Pleeeease Carrie please? I'll try my best. But it's sorta sad. What's sad? Before he met you he never smiled. Now he smiles all the time but I think if you go.. I think he's gonna stop again. I'm sure you make him smile all the time. Right? Yeah-- Come on. Let's get some puzzle done. Dimitri: These are so good... Hi, thank you for coming. It's exciting isn't it? It's a new American classic. But only in the ironic sense. Oh! Mmmmmm... Mmmm! Excuse me, hi, I ordered a martini ten minutes ago. I'm sorry ma'am we've been so busy that I- You're an actor. Right? Yeah I can tell. If you're as bad an actor as you are a waiter, you better pack it up and move back to your parent's basement. Okay? It'll just be a minute- Yeah it better be or I'm gonna have you fired. Go! I appreciate that. Have a good night. I was so anxious to get here I didn't get a chance to eat. No, that's alright, please help yourself there's plenty. Glad you're enjoying it. It's fabulous isn't it?! Dimitri this is the best seared beef I've ever tasted. No no, it's not seared, it's barbequed. It's an American classic just like my exhibition. Scott-- I would love to introduce you to the most exciting new caterer in town, Scott Walker. So you're the one responsible for this taste revelation. Well thank you. --Thank you Demitri. If you have an opportunity check out my restaurant. Do you have a card? I can pass it on to our food critic. Actually, I do-- There you go. Well if you'll excuse me gentlemen I'm off to enjoy the art. Yes the art- Thank you- Scott we are a smash! Listen if you're ever thinking of expanding your restaurant and you need a partner- Don't worry you'll be the first person I call. Wonderful, wonderful thank you. Well thank you, Dimitri. Thank you. Oh oh and Scott- Merry Christmas! Oh-- Come here! Okay-- Merry Christmas. Okay, okay-- Stop working! Okay-- Go, go, go enjoy the art. Okay-- Excuse me, hi. Hi. Hi. I couldn't help but overhear Dimitri saying that you were the one responsible for the incredible food tonight. Yeah, yeah I am. I thought you might like a glass of champagne. Oh yes I would, thank you. So are you and Dimitri friends or- Well no, this is the first time I've worked with him. Oh well, aren't I one lucky lady. Not only am I chatting with the most handsome man in the room, but the chef as well. Well, thank you. I'm Lynette Bloom. Oh I'm sorry, Scott Walker. Very nice to meet you. You as well. Are you a friend of Demitri's? Uh no, no I've never heard of him. Although I think it will change after this. I certainly hope so. Are you an art lover? Actually I'm just here looking for contacts and scouting out the competition. Oh- I work for an event planning agency. I'm doing the big united charities New Year's Ball next week. Wow that's impressive. Thank you! So, Scott any big plans for Christmas? No I'm just going to spend the holidays with my daughter. Oh that's sweet. How old is she? She's eight. And did you uh, bring your wife tonight? No my wife passed away five years ago. I'm sorry. It's okay. It must be a really hard time of year for you. Life goes on, doesn't it? And keeps sending us challenges. That it does. To life's opportunities? To life's opportunities. Henry! Come outside for a minute. Um...Abby I'm just going to take the garbage out! What's up? I got you your extra day. Thank you Henry. But Carrie-- The front office is very concerned that you may break a rule. Don't worry I'm not gonna tell them I'm an angel. Not that one. They're worried that you're going to make contact with someone from your former life. Holidays can make people very sentimental. Well my father's my only family and he's probably in Aspen right about now skiing-- May I remind you that his daughter was just in a terrible accident a few days ago? And may I remind you that I'm his daughter? I'm sure he'll be sad that I died and he'll do all the appropriate grieving father things but he's gonna get back to normal in no time. I think you're being a little harsh. I know my father. Did you two have a fight? My father should never have been a parent. His world was art artists and business. In that order. Everything he did had a reason. Every action he made was another step on the ladder of success. There's just no room for a family in that kind of lifestyle. That's very sad. Every Christmas morning I would come running down the stairs and there would be presents under the pop art Christmas tree but- He'd always be at some party in Vale or the Alps. I don't know when it happened but at some point we just... started living separate lives. And there's no anger or a grudge- There's not really much of anything. Of course I see it now-- That I was just like him. So totally focused on my career... just everything else took a backseat. You must have had some friends. In college. But once I moved here I thought... there would always be time for making friends. Of course I was wrong about that. You know the greatest gift that tragedy brings is that it forces you to reconsider the things you've been taking for granted. You can stay until midnight Christmas day. If for any reason you decide you want to cross over Christmas eve, go to the park bench. I'll be there. I promised Abby I'd stay. Fine. But you have a way out if you need it. Thank you. Whoa... Hey buddy. Ugh- What time is it? Hey. Eight o'clock. You looked so peaceful last night, I didn't wanna wake you up. What time did you get in? Late. Hey you. Go brush your teeth. So? Come on don't keep me in suspense. How'd it go? The barbeque? Kicked butt! There's a critic from the Times coming to the restaurant next week. Oh and Danny- Demitri wants to invest so we can expand. That's amazing. I knew people would flip. You've helped my business a lot and I think you should be paid for that. I want to give you commission. Oh no that's not necessary. No I insist. Let's talk about it again after Christmas. Alright then but we're gonna talk about it. Deal? Deal. Alright. Wow things must have gone really well if you're already talking about commission. Is there more to the story? Yes but I'll have to tell you later. Right now I have to get Abby to school- Abby honey! Abby: Coming! Um, well maybe I can stop by the restaurant later. Perfect. There's coffee here, there's cereal just help yourself and lock the door on the way out, okay? Great. Bye Carrie! Gonna be late, come on-- Have a good day at school. Abby: Bye! Bye. Thank you folks. And uh, Merry Christmas. Hey- Wow! It's a busy day. Yeah I had a dozen customers come in because they heard about the barbeque. And we sold twenty plates at lunch today. Hey hon. Uh Scott this delivery guy dropped this off for you. Thanks Rita. I got you an early Christmas present too. Oh yeah? Yeah I hope you don't mind...but I got a tree for you and Abby. Well that's so sweet. It's not big I just- I thought you might like a place to put your presents. Maybe I have something to go underneath it. Just got it back from the jeweller, had it cleaned. It was Abby's mother's. She'll love wearing it. Maybe the three of us could decorate the tree together tonight. Yeah, sure- Or...not. Well no it's not that I don't want to, I just- Well-- I have a date. What? Yeah. I met her at the party last night. Really? Who is she? Strange thing is she's in same line of work as you. She works in event planning. Huh-- I don't think it's gonna be a late dinner. I think it's gonna be an early one so maybe you and Abby can start doing the decorations and I can catch up later. I'm sorry, I'm not asking you to go on babysitting duty, I already made plans with Betsy for that. I just thought you wanted to decorate. That's fine. I bought the tree for both of you so- Thank you so much. So tell me more about this event planner. What's her name? Lynette Bloom. What?? Yeah she works with one of the biggest agencies. She's got some big job planning an event for the united charities new year's ball? Oh- Oh, speak of the Devil, there she is- I- I gotta go. Where are you going? I'll see you later! Okay-- Hey! Hey. Something's wrong. I love him. This can't be happening. That can't be part of the plan. Honey the plan is for Scott. What about me? Mortals and angels live on different plains. So what are you telling me? I found my soul mate but it's too late for me to do anything about it? Don't you think that kind of sucks? Carrie, there's a master plan that we're not allowed to see. You just have to have faith that everything has a purpose. Well now he's going out with Lynette. If everything is supposed to happen tell me how that happened. Well he's been in a slump for years. Suddenly he's-- Upbeat, optimistic, dynamic- That attracts women. Do you have any idea what kind of trouble that woman is? Because he needs to know- He needs to know she's a- Doesn't matter. You cannot reveal yourself to her. It would ruin everything. No. I can't do it. I can't leave him with Lynette. Carrie, be careful! You're playing with fire! Carrie look what we did! You started decorating. Abby: Just a little. No worries it looks great. Thanks a lot for the tree. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure come on in the kitchen. Keep on decorating honey. You're doing a great job. Sure! I wanna talk to you about Lynette. Okay, good. Let's start by explaining why you ran off today. I just want to warn you that she's not the type of person you can trust. How do you even know Lynette? I can't tell you. Alright I think you're the one playing games here- Is there anything else? No. Look if you're not comfortable being here I can always go get Betsy- No I...want to spend the evening with Abby. I promised-- If it's okay. I guess I'll see you later then-- Alright, I'm gonna go- Oh, okay- Have fun sweetie. Love you. I love you too sweetie. Oh Carrie-- I was thinking about making a popcorn garland. I think it looks more...classic. I think that sounds like a great idea. Abby I have some... bad news. You're leaving- Yeah. Look I was really looking forward to spending Christmas with you guys, but I- My plans have changed and I think I need to leave tomorrow. But...tomorrow's Christmas eve. I know. I'm sorry. But hey, I will always look out for you, okay? Wait-- So you don't forget us. I'd never forget you. Thank you. Hi. Abby and I finished decorating the tree. She went to bed right when she was supposed to. Great. Look um I don't think I'm going to be able to spend Christmas with you after all. Um I said my goodbyes to her tonight. Whoa whoa whoa, slow down here- Okay am I going to see you again? Carrie? I'll stop by the restaurant. Tomorrow. Okay well we close early for Christmas eve, so- Well I'll be there before then. Alright-- Oh... Why did I think this side was going to be full of sunshine and rainbows? Human emotion doesn't stop at the grave. What we feel in life we feel here. I'm not going to need that extension 'til Christmas day. How do I...cross over? Be here tomorrow night at midnight.

Could never nail the chorus, but-- It's getting there-- It's not there yet, but it's coming along. My wife used to sit there. Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry-- No, no-- No. It's okay. She used to sit there for hours... Never said a word, just...never had to. When I wasn't getting it right she'd just-- Give me a look. Her look.

Okay-- ♪ I'm falling and drifting ♪ ♪ and spinning around ♪ ♪ There's no one to catch me ♪ ♪ when I hit the ground ♪ Scott Walker, I have known some dumb men in my life, but you are the dumbest. Scott, she just walked out that door and you let her! I love you, but you drive me up the wall. Until last week, you were a gloomy and depressed man that sucked the joy out of everything Suddenly, Carrie arrived and you're smiling. Joking, laughing! Rita, what are you talking about? You're in love! You idiot. Now I told you, I'm never wrong about these things! You're in love. And now you're gonna have to figure out what to do about it. Ugh... Carrie! I can't be in love-- Congratulations, Carrie. The front office did some forecasting and looks like clear sailing from now on for Scott. Swell. You were perfect, You followed all three laws, and you still gave Scott what he needed. You even managed to bring back some of his old enthusiasm. You say that like you've known him for a long time. I have. All his life. You're his father. Then-- Why didn't you help him?? Why'd you have to bring me into the mix? I was told to approach you. It's your destiny. To have my heart shattered?! No-- To open his. Great! Good, that's great, because you know what? It's open now! He's out for dinner with Lynette while we speak. A toast-- To what is on its way to being the most memorable Christmas ever. Well, you must be really busy with the New Year's Ball. I'm gonna make it the event of the year. People in China are gonna be talking about it. Wow! And to think, I almost didn't get it. Really? Why not? We were competing for the contract with another agency. They had this woman pitch them some ideas and they were planning on going with her-- I was furious. Well, that's business. No, it was more than that. Carrie and I have always had this sort of competition between us. What was her name? Carrie. Carrie what? Carrie Blackford. Why? What happened? On the day the contracts were supposed to be signed, she was in a major car accident. She's in a coma. What?? Yeah, I guess it is really sad. She's at Thermer General. And her dad, he's this big art dealer. I heard he's been at her side everyday just waiting for her to wake up. So, she still has a chance? I don't know. I heard she's on life support and they're wondering whether or not to pull the plug. Are you okay? Yeah-- No. I'm not. I'm I'm I'm sorry-- I need to go. I rememered I have to do something. Well, at least take me home. No, look-- Take a cab-- And uh-- Just take it all-- Take care of the food too. I'm sorry, I have to go-- Scott, I-- Dad! Is everything okay?? Abby, remember when you told me that Carrie's an angel? Did you mean she was a really nice person and a pretty lady? No, she's an angel, dad! A real angel! I tried to tell you but you didn't believe me. Well, I do now honey. Grab your jackets. Dad, what's wrong?! Betsy, can you give us a drive to Thermer Hospital? Abby: What?! Is somebody hurt?? I'm not sure-- We need to get there right now. Yes, alright, here we go-- Thank you for coming. I know that somewhere she's listening. She needs to stay. That can't happen. They've run all the tests and there's no hope. I've been hoping against hope. Praying that she'd get some sign that she could come back to me. Even if it was just long enough for me to tell her that I love her more than anyone else on earth. There's been nothing-- And it's not fair to keep her like this-- I've been dreading signing this-- But I realize I'm being selfish. She'll be at peace in just a couple of minutes. She's gonna come back to us, mister. My dear-- That would take Christmas magic-- Abby: No-- Dad! Carrie, I have a confession to make. This mission wasn't just about Scott. Front office was concerned that you were a young woman So dedicated to your career that you were neglecting everything else in life. Well, I see that now. So thank you. That's because you have perspective now. We talked about this. Now obviously everyone in life can't have a near-death experience to make them realize what's important in life. So we've been using Christmas for the past 2000 and some odd years. As a way of getting people to stop for a day or two and think about somebody else for a change. How's that working out for you? Well, it's not perfect. But you'd be surprised at our success rate. Of course for extreme cases like you and Scott extreme measures are called for. Carrie-- It's time. Are they gonna be okay?
