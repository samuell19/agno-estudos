I've got one problem. I've got too many emotions in my heart... but I seem silent. You have to look carefully. All troubles arrive silently without any noise. They enter the home silently, like the air. This is the story of my silence and... of that which is hidden in my silence. Listen to it carefully. Because this is the only way... I can tell my untold story. Please! Please! What? Fuel money... Get out! I don't need your money. Get out! Come on... I don't need. Out! Talk... Why are you so late? I've been waiting for an hour. Now you'll say you went to get petrol. Hmm... You're not lying, right? No, dad. How did you get blood on your hand? While getting the petrol. Why don't you understand that whatever we do, it's all for you. We've been waiting for this moment for many years. Remember...? Hmm... Now let's go. Some really rich people are waiting for us. Good morning! You choose colours according to your mood and emotions. You speak through your paintings, my dear. Mr. and Mrs. Desai are here. They are waiting inside with Ananth. Come... let's go. I hope you understand what you want won't happen. Mrs. Abha has made Surabhi responsible for the whole estate. Now she controls everything. Let me give you some friendly advice. We should end this conversation now, to avoid seeing each other in the court. Again you talk like a lawyer. Ananth. Today, Abha's estate is worth billions. I've worked for it day and night. I was building this estate when Surabhi was in some third-class Indian orphanage. Stop it, Kishore. Surabhi. Welcome, how are you? Have a seat. You've got an exhibition next week, right? I'm really looking forward to seeing it. Let's talk about the thing we're here to talk about. Let me be very clear, Surabhi. Abha aunty made you this estate's trustee to maintain it, not to donate it away. And mind you... Think carefully before you make any decisions. Sorry, Surabhi. His anger issues get worse with age. He overreacts to every tiny detail. Do what you think is right. I'm not overreacting. I don't think she understands. Being a trustee of this estate isn't a joke. It's a big responsbility. business, finance and employees? Can you handle all of these? You worry too much... enough, Kishore. I'll see you next week... at your exhibition. Let's go, Kishore. Bye, Surabhi. If you are my daughter, you won't be afraid of anything. Never ever. Promise me. I asked you what she wrote. Do you think she said something new? There is no point in discussing it now. Mrs. Abha wrote Surabhi into her will a long time ago. Surabhi has only just found out about it. And I think she's doing the good thing. We never value the things we get for free. You're wise. This is childish. Make her understand this. Everyone is making a big mistake. The man was stabbed and choked to death. And the girl? She is still in a coma. Keep me informed. Yeah, we'll do. Well, it's been a long day, mate. -I'll see you tomorrow. -Yeah. Good night. This is Jonathan pyne, reporting breaking news... with live news updates... In the early hours of the morning, ...there was been a terrible tragedy witnessed by a small town Skipton in Yorkshire. An unidentified man is being blamed for the murder of the petrol pump owner. According to police sources the CCTV cameras of the petrol pump were not functional and there were no witnesses which is making the job of the police much more harder. Now I understand why you were late. You did this, right? He was teasing the girl. "He was teasing the girl." Do you remember why we are here? Or should I remind you? I remember. I have told you so many times not to trust girls. All girls are the same. They create and attract problems for us. But you just don't understand. Shame on you! I'm sorry. You're just like your mother. You've been a disappointment to me ever since you were born. You can't do anything properly. And I keep putting my trust in you every time. But now... I think you don't need me. I'm going. Don't go, dad. I won't disappoint you. You will. - No. I won't. Dev, I'm giving you one last chance. Understand? She is too young to handle these responsibilities. Don't you think she can handle it? No, I don't mean that. I have spent my whole life watching people fighting over money and property. But I've never seen someone donating millions in an instant. She hasn't made this decision in an instant, Anand... She decided it years ago. Surabhi wants to help many orphan kids as she can with this money. Yeah, but Surabhi doesn't know the Desai family. And the Desai family don't know Surabhi. She'll do exactly what she wants to do. True. We've gone through a lot... And we've spent our whole life on the road. But everything will change today. We will take whatever is ours from them. Here are the papers. I'll get them registered by the Magistrate tomorrow. According to this, you are donating 50% of Abha's estate's income... to the orphanage forever. Read it properly and sign it. Some tea? - No, thank you. Hey... you haven't read it. You're a very intelligent and good-hearted girl. I'm proud of you. I'll see you tomorrow. Take care. If your heart thinks it's right, it's absolutely right. Let the world say what it wants, you just listen to your heart. Boys! Boys, what's wrong with you? Who are you? Me... ? Don't you recognise me ? Look, this is a private property... I'm not going to get arrested... for murdering a trespasser, got it?! Your advice has made it easy for me, I'm not the trespasser here. You are... What have you got? I've killed the lawyer. It's the will. Where's she? Where's that girl? - Maybe she is inside. Why is she inside? Go and get her body. No need. She is deaf and dumb. She is deaf and dumb, but she understands everything. She can read lips. She has taken everything which belongs to us. But dad... But...? You are doing it again. We should not hurt girls, right? Do you remember what your mother did to us? Do you remember? Hmm... Are you sitting on the stairs waiting for your mother? Do you think your mother's coming back? She is not coming back. She's gone. She has left us. She... She left this letter. Do you know what it says? It says that she is going to her parent's house because of me. But the truth is... that she is going because of you. You're unlucky. You have made this house a living hell, ever since you were born. We are going through so much now. I wonder what will happen when you grow up. Your mother left us because of you. Because of you, I had to live without my wife. Now that it's time to take revenge, you're hesitating! I... Everything belongs to us. This is ours. - Yes. We'll not tolerate this injustice. I want to see rage in your eyes. I want to see rage. Coming... Hello brother Mushtak... How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm fine. It's so cold outside. Please come inside. Thank you. What happened? You're here at this hour, is everything ok? Two people have been brutally murdered at the petrol station behind your estate. Oh, my God. - We haven't been able to catch the killer. Oh... - No, don't be scared. Just inform the police if you see anyone acting suspiciously. Of course. -Also inform your care taker James. -Yeah, of course, I'll tell him. He will be here soon to feed the dogs. I'll inform him then. Does he still drink or what? Mr. Mushtak, old habits die hard. -Okay, fine. -Thank you so much for informing me. You're welcome. It's so beautiful. Your paintings keep you so busy... God, this exhibition. Go and take a bath. I'll get the meal ready... okay. Only five minutes. We'll cook together. It will take less time. Rice... Rice.... Rice. It's so tasty. Ginger, Pepper. I can taste it separately. Su...Su...Surabhi. ...Surabhi. Surabhi.....! Surabhi.....! Don't you get angry seeing this palace? Your mother left you for this house, for this luxurious life? When she was missing her child, she didn't call you. Instead, she adopted a deaf and dumb girl from an orphanage somewhere in London. She gave all the property to her, not to you and then she died. This is such an injustice. And today... justice will be done. This is all yours... Surabhi... '' No network Insert sim card '' Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello! Hello. Are you looking for someone? Yes. We've had a report that someone has escaped from the asylum. Yes, of course. Please follow me, Officer. Thank you mate. Well, this is him. He suffers from a severe paranoid schizophrenia. He is a murderer. On account of his mental illness, he has skipped a jail term and landed up in here. The report says he was talking about his father waiting for him outside. Yes, he was. And he murdered two attendants here... to escape? Sadly, yes. He's very clever. Extremely dangerous indeed. I think she has run away. Hmmm. She has run away. Do you remember when you were a kid, you were the champion of hide and seek? Remember? No one could catch you. Now, the champion of hide and seek... can't even find one girl. Can't the champion find the girl? Anybody home? Is anybody there? James? Why is it dark in the house? Ah... Are you scared? She is also scared. You're under arrest. Surabhi. we're playing hide and seek. Why do I feel that... you're spoiling our game? We're here to play hide and seek... not.. cops and robbers. Officers, it's all good. It's all good. I'm not a thief. And I'm not the police. Who are you? Playing. What? Do you play? Surabhi? I'll send her to you. Will you please wait a little while? I never hidden the fact from you that I'm not your biological mother. However, I loved you even more than my own biological child. That's all I hid. I left my son back in my past life. Surabhi, you've half of the coin. He has the other half. I kept him away because I was afraid of my husband. But I'm scared, Surabhi, that... one day he will bring him here. If that happens, you will recognise my son, with the other half of the same coin. And just know that... he would kill anyone. He will be here to take everything from you, Surabhi. Be very afraid of him, Surabhi. Be very afraid... Surabhi...! Surabhi, what? What's wrong? Calm down,...calm....Surabhi. What?... What's wrong? What?....tell...tell me....Surabhi? Please. Who're you? Surabhi... You move Wait, never mind, dear. I'm talking to you. What're you doing in here? Who are you? You can't just come walking in here, you know. It's a private property. You hear me? Get out. Get out! Now! Get out! Lord! What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Why are you staring at me? Where is that girl's body? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? What are you doing? -Have you gone mad? -Yes. You hit me in the same way. on my ears... Same way. Do you remember? I may have beaten you. You may have misbehaved. But this is not the right time to discuss all of that. If you love me, why did you beat me? Why don't you love me? -This is the way I love you. -No! You have only hated me. Do you think so? I'm standing right in front of you. You're in the habit of killing people,right? Come on, kill me. Vent your anger on me again. Come on. You're just like your mother... You're good to outsiders... but creating sorrow for us. Kill me. Just like your mother... No! I'll prove it. What're you thinking? Kill her. Your mother chose her over you. She is the last sign of your mother. Kill her. Don't think. Don't think. Now I won't think. I'll kill her. I'm just like you. I'll make you proud, Dad. Surabhi. Surabhi. Surabhi. Are you okay?... It's not over yet. I'm looking for you from a long time... to complete that game which has not been completed. Okay, let's make a deal. I'll replace you. Lets play... What? What are you trying to say? Oh, I got it. That... he has killed my husband, right? Is that what you are trying to say? I know. I saw that. I understand your sign language very well. But you don't understand my sign language. Is sign language so difficult to understand? Who is he? He is the son of the mother who raised you. He is mad. After seeing his asylum file, I understood everything. He really wanted to kill you. So I helped him escape from the asylum. Now he is after you. Nobody has any patience. Kishore has the same problem. That's why he got killed. I told him that... I'll handle that third grade, adopted, orphan girl. But no, he just did not understand. See? He got killed. Leave me... Kill you... Don't come in between us. Isn't it ? This time... you escaped... This is the story which I can't explain to anyone. This is the story of my silence. This is the story of a terrible night I keep hidden in my silence. But this night has taught me a lesson. It has taught me that the dark night... can not stop the rising sun. We just have to stay strong. We have to live without losing hope. We have to pass through tough time. The past can't defeat those who look forward to a better tomorrow.
