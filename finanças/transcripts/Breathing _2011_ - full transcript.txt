It's tough, I know... It's his mother after all. Set it down there. Find me some underwear and stockings. Look in the dresser over there. What good is having children? Honestly. If you die alone in the end anyway... Can you help me with her blouse? Pull it down. Just pull it down. Collect the wash things and put them away. Would you like to see the deceased? When's your thing again? For your parole. - The hearing. How should I know what it's called? Monday. And do you think they'll give it to you? I don't know. I don't know.

Fourteen. And the guy you murdered? I didn't murder him. He died at the hospital. What's wrong? He's still warm. Want to switch sides? That's OK. Good evening. Coffee, cold drinks, sandwiches? No thanks. Or give me a beer too. Thanks. Keep the change. Thank you, sir. Have a nice trip. Cheers. We're late, Kogler. What happened? Mass fatality incident? We were about to start a manhunt. Feet apart and bend over. Cough. Stand up. Did I say to get dressed? Breathe. Again, harder and longer. What did you drink? Come on. I've got a 0.2 reading. What did you drink? A beer. Well, well. Are we allowed to? I asked if you're allowed to. No. Then why do you do it'? Must I write you up the day before my vacation? Look at me when I talk to you! Should I write you up'? You grew up in an orphanage, right'? You've never really been outside. Exciting. Done? - Yes. Windows on the inside too? See you tomorrow. You can go. No one else is dying today. You just missed her. She just left. Did you want to try? I'm done anyway. Ms. Kogler? Yes? Mommy, can we buy this? - Constantine, put that back please. Please! - Put it back! So how are you? Great. Job? What do you do? Diving instructor. In the summer in the Danube, in the wintertime it depends. Seychelles, Mauritius, New Zealand. I'm going down there again next week. To Mauritius? - New Zealand. Is that in Australia? You're lucky. Next week it's supposed to get cold again here. Do you dye your hair? NO, why? Short hair suits you. I should have my hair done again too. How old are you now? 19. Where did you get my address anyway? Child welfare office. And the phone call this morning was you too? Yes. Should we go? Where? I thought you wanted to buy a mattress? Well? I should get it, right? Makes you feel like never getting up. What are you doing here? Helping someone carry something. Do you realize what time it is? I have the late shift this week. Daddy, who is that man? An acquaintance, Roberta. I think that's us, I'll go see. Is that her? Yes. Daddy, who is that woman? - Just a sec, Roberta. I hope you know what you're doing. Come on Roberta, we have to go. Where are you going with that? Just to the bus stop. Is that your mattress? Yes. My old one is all worn out. And who is the man? Which man? In front, is he your boyfriend? Roberta, call mommy and tell her we'll be a little late. About Monday, wear a dress shirt. Hi Mommy, we'll be a little late. Do you have one? - No. Daddy said "a little". Can you get one? At IKEA. Hey! I don't know, maybe. Not maybe. Borrow one from someone. It makes a good impression. We're taking home a lady with a mattress. Mommy wants to talk to you. Yes? I don't know. 20 minutes, half an hour. Why? What do you want me to do? I know what we said, but it ended up taking longer. Yes, sorry, because of my stupid kitchen! Daddy and Mommy are fighting. No, I don't think so. She can stay with me tonight. Yes, McDonald's! No, Roberta. We're not eating at McDonald's. It's over here on the right. I can't talk right now. Bye. - My pleasure. Don't forget the shirt. Just put it down anywhere. But it's still wet. That's OK, it's laminated flooring. What about the old one? I guess I'll put it in the basement for now. If you want, I'll help you carry it down. No, leave it. I've still got time. - No thanks. I'll do it later. Or I can unwrap the new... Forget the fucking mattress! Why did you give me up? What? Why did you give me up? It was the best thing I did in my life. Kogler, telephone! Kogler. Same here. Do you need something? Could you look up a name for me? Martin Stuppek. What about him? - Nothing. Just wondering where he's buried. Stuppek? - Yes. With two p's? I think so. Martin Stuppek. Born on 4/26/1992, died on 2/4/2006. Jedlesee Cemetery, row 14, section 2. Have a nice weekend. Bye. See you Monday. That's my hearing. Then see you Tuesday. Write it down? What? - Should I write it down for you? Yes please. Well, what are you going to do if they let you out'? Come on, come on. Isn't there something you want? Everyone wants something. What about you? A little Ducati Monster. They don't have a big one? Very funny, on my salary. The big one is for dreamers. You gotta wish for what you can get. You know? I thought you got that anyway. I thought you were a diving instructor. Or is this just temporary, until you go to New Zealand? Look at me when I talk to you! Roman! That's better. When your mom says so... Were you ashamed to tell me? What was so good about it'? - What? You said giving me up was the best thing you ever did. What was so good about it'? Can we talk about something else? About what? The children's home? Juvenile home? What do you want me to say'? That I was a bad mother. You talked to child welfare. Don't they have files? You know what? Do you smoke a lot? Not so much. Let me have a puff. I used to smoke 40 a day and more. But not while I was pregnant with you. Not a single one. Good girl. Yes, good mommy. And you don't mind the dead bodies? I couldn't do it. Someone has to do it. Do you wash and dress them too? I suffocated you with a pillow back then. All I wanted was to sleep, but you screamed your head off. I took a pillow and held it over your face. I didn't even press that hard, but after a while it was quiet under the pillow. Now he is dead, I thought, now I can't sleep for sure. I was so furious at you. Then I pinched your nose and breathed into your mouth, like with one of those first-aid dolls. And at some point you were back again. The next day I took you to child welfare. What do you think of your mom now? Then I took off my shoe. And then? Then I hit him with it. Show us. But slow and easy. We have time. What's wrong? Then he let go. Then I got up and ripped the sweatshirt off of my head. Good, then do that. And what about Stuppek? He was sitting there on the floor. And? Was he injured, was he bleeding? I don't think so. He was holding his head. And you, what did you do then? Hit him again. I didn't hear you. Then I hit him again. The defendant states that he hit the victim again. How many times did you hit him again? How many times? Once, twice? I don't remember. Translation: Kimi Lum Subtitles: TITRA-Vienna
