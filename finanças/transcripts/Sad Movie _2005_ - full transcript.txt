The rain should cool down this unseasonably early heat. After the showers pass... It'll rain today. Soo-jeong Hwi-chan! NO ENTRY except Snow White & 7 Dwarfs! Help me out. If this keeps up, our son will be uncontrollable. Because it keeps getting more serious! How can you be so laid back about this? He's your son too, isn't he? All you do is accuse me of being overbearing. Oh, whatever! It's because you never seem to care about anything. Okay. I have an incoming call. Let's talk at home. Yes, Ms. Kim. How are you? This is Hwi-chan's picture diary. Take a look. These days especially, He seems to have many complaints about you.

This afternoon, a fire broke out in a Seoul warehouse, 35-year old Lee who was working inside the warehouse was injured from smoke inhalation. While rescuing him, two firemen from Dobong Station received burns and are currently in intensive care. The fire burned down the whole warehouse and $350 thousand worth of property was damaged.

I can't take it anymore. Every time I hear a siren, my heart drops. Soo-jeong. It's okay, so let's go. There are other people here. No, it's not okay. Who cares about other people? - I care about you, and about myself. - Soo-jeong. These people say you're cool, encouraging that you are a great fireman. That's all, isn't it? Su-jeong, that's not it. And so they just push you deeper and deeper into the fire, right? Soo-jeong, no... You know... how we work here... You know. No, I don't know. I've forgotten it all.

I didn't make her cry, kiddo. By the way, what's with your long face? Does your girlfriend want to break up? Or, you want to break up, but you're having trouble saying it? You're too young to be making that kind of face. When you get old, you'll have plenty of chances to be sad. Mister, what do you do anyway? Me? To keep the one I love, I make other couples break up. What's that supposed to mean? You wouldn't understand... Here. Take this, in case you need it later. Take it. Separation Agency Stop sighing at the ground! Stop sighing at the sky.

Don't just yell for help, you need to help him first. At least you can say "I love you." You're better off than me. Su-Eun. You know why I wanted him to propose to me? It was all for him. If he confessed his love and thought about marriage and such. Then, he could think about me once more before jumping into the fire and make him a bit more scared of the fire I thought I could change him. That's how it started but now I've become sort of fixated on it. I understand the situation, but if you could help... Yes... just a moment. Dad. Don't tell Mom about it. I heard that his mother has cancer. Your dad's a doctor, right? - Do you know about cancer? - Sure. - What happens if you get it? - You die. Everyone with cancer dies. Why? Does someone have it? No... Mom... Mom! Mom, are you okay? Of course! Why wouldn't I be? You know how much I wanted to blow this whistle? Whenever I see you, I'm full of energy. Mom, wait a second.
