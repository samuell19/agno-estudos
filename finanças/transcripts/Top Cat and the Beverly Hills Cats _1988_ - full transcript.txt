["Top Cat" theme] creak [yawns] [upbeat music] boing squeak squeak squeak clang clang clang (Top Cat) 'Rivoli! Rivoli! Rise and shine, alley scouts.' 'Up and at 'em, on the double.' 'Let's do our good deeds for the day.' [music continues] screech ruff ruff ruff boing [theme music] boing Hey, guys, here's Benny. Now the alley cat troop is present and accounted for. [theme music] Gee, guys, I don't know. Pretending to be alley scouts.. - B., is that legal? - Beats me, Benny. But when do we get to sell the cookies? Those are girl scout cookies, Brain. Somebody must've tied a knot in his head. [all laughing] (Top Cat) 'Alright, alright.' Alley cats, attention! Way to go, troop. We got a whole day of good deeds just waitin' to be done. - Can you handle it, fellas? - 'You know it, T.C.' But what's with the electrical appliance? Good question, Fancy, and I quote the alley cat manual. "It's the early bird that hits the fan." Now, a periscope. Aye aye, T.C. (Top Cat) '30 degrees East, 60 North, zeroing in.' 'And here comes our first good deed of the day.' [smooth jazz music] whoosh Well, what do you know, a brand new hat. Who could it belong to? This is who, pussyfoot. T.C.'s the name. And doing good's our game. But don't feel obligated to reward us, sir just because we're livin' on the brink of poverty. [bones cracking] (male #1) 'Thanks, T.C.' And here's a little advice for you and your scouts. Get lost! [dramatic music] Maybe we better read the manual again, T.C. Told you we should be selling cookies. Oh, if only I were a Doberman Pinscher. Okay, troop, time to move out and iron those merit badges. Now, how do we do it? (all) Badges for bucks. Again! (all) Badges for bucks! You got it, fellas, and remember.. ...it's not just doin' a good deed that counts it's what you get afterwards. "Rewards R Us." Yeah, but I got a problem, T.C.' I know, Brain, that scholarship to MIT. It may not come through, but there's always West Point. No, I mean I can't think of any good deeds to do. 'All the easy ones are taken.' [upbeat music] You've lucked out, Brain. 'What better good deed than cleanin'' 'somebody's dirty windshield.' Yuck! boing One little criticism. Next time you clean a windshield make sure there's a driver 'sittin' behind it.' squeak squeak squeak Gotcha! Oh, but what happens if their windshields ain't really dirty? I knew you'd ask that. You're on your own, alley scout. Be creative. [upbeat music] zoom [slurps] Gee! T.C.'s not gonna like this. So far the only good deed I've done is to buy myself a carton of milk. grrr chomp chomp chomp gulp Good deed number two. But I don't think I'd better askhim for a reward. (Benny) 'A street person. Just like myself.' Hi, ma'am. Alley scout, Benny the Ball, at your service. - Anything I can do for you? - Yeah, sonny. You can leave me alone, okay? Sure, ma'am. But first, let me help you across the street. But I don't want to cross the street. thud Oh! My cart! crash [dramatic music] I'm terribly sorry. All I was doing was-- Makin' a pest of yourself. Now will you please do me a favor and help somebody else? Yes, ma'am, and if there's anything more I can ever do for you.. (male #2) 'Look out below!' [dramatic music] Watch out, ma'am! Look out! thud Why.. Why, you saved my life. No problem, ma'am. I ju-just hope you're alright. You're a credit to your uniform. How can I ever thank you? Well, if our leader T.C. was here he'd think of somethin'. But you bein' alive is enough for me. Now, where is that? It's very valuable. Gee, I couldn't take a reward, ma'am. Really. Whatever it is, keep it for yourself. Oh, here it is. My memory book. You just write down your name so I'll remember you as a hero. My pleasure, ma'am. How do you spell Rambo? [chuckles] It's just a little joke. Well, good luck, ma'am. I sure hope things get better for you. Thanks, sonny. You know what they say. Behind every silver cloud, there's...a chauffeur. (chauffeur) 'Good afternoon, Mrs. Vandergelt.' - Did you enjoy your shopping? - Oh, thank you, James. One thing about disguising myself as a bag lady you find out who your friends really are. [smooth jazz music] [sighs] I'm just not feeling like my old self, James. 'Maybe my time has come.' 'Besides, people think I'm loony.' (James) 'Oh, not so, Mrs. Vandergelt.' 'Eccentric perhaps, but definitely not loony.' (Mrs. Vandergelt) 'Oh, good ol' Beverly Hills.' There's no place like home. I just wish my long-lost niece was around to share it with me. Don't worry, Mrs. Vandergelt. One of these days, she'll turn up. I really do miss you, Amy. 'Wherever you are, I hope you're happy.' I don't understand it. What have I done to deserve this? You're holdin' up production, little orphan Amy. Hey, how many times have I told you? This is Beverly hills. We use only bottled water. Now get some. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. If this is Beverly Hills, I'll take Detroit. [upbeat music] Okay, okay, scouts, bring in the good deeds. Easy, Chooch. Have more respect for the uniform. Yeah, T.C. I was helpin' this little guy change his tire when suddenly, it rolled down the hill-- Say no more. You've done your good deed. Let's just hope the pawn shop takes retreads. Next! What happened to you? D-don't tell me. A good deed in a Laundromat. Except that I was taking a nap in the dryer when this lady opened it for her laundry. 'You should've heard the scream when she saw me.' I don't blame her. Now, all we have to do is find a fence that handles.. ...long johns. While he's at it, maybe Long John has a sister for me. [siren wailing] (Top Cat) 'It's Miami Mice. Quick, Fancy.' Time to play wilderness. screech screech screech tonk Your little windshield washing scam is over. Sorry, T.C., he was my first good deed. (Officer Dibble) 'I wonder, who could've given him that bag of dirt.' - You know what this means, T.C. - Of course I do, Dibble. It means that poor Brain here is still suffering from a childhood affliction. - He is? - 'Yeah, yeah. Shh, shh.' (Top Cat) 'Don't the spread the word, but he's a terminal twit.' Thanks, T.C., I need that. (Benny) 'Hey, guys, guys, guess what?' You'll never believe what happened. There was this poor old bag lady and she left her bag behind-- Don't say any more, Benny, until he reads you your rights. - Yeah, but I saved her life. - Nice try, kid. The old "saved her life" trick. He might buy it. No way! I've had it with all of you. - You're gettin' a summons. - Not a summons, Dibble. Come on, we're all buddies. You know how we feel about you. Yeah, and despite that, we still don't deserve it. That's it. At last you guys are gonna face the music. [violin music] It's easy to say, Dibble, when you're not from the streets. When you haven't had to scrimp and save and scrounge for enough to eat. Do you know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night with an empty stomach and you're all out of.. '...chopped liver?' And you're all out of luck, T.C. Call me agent, tell him to put the concert tour on hold. What do you got to say for yourself? (Top Cat) I want my money. (male on radio) 'Car 861. Car 861.' 'Headquarters calling Officer Dibble.' - 'Officer Dibble reportin'.' - 'Congratulations, Dibble.' 'Your application for retirement has finally been approved.' - 'It's official.' - My retirement from the force? It's come through. I don't believe it. Oh, thank you, thank you. From now on, nobody misses Sunday school. That's a promise. Bein' this is my last day on the job, T.C. I'm lettin' you all go. You can forget the summons. Oh, a noble gesture, Dibble. Happy retirement. We'll miss you, won't we Benny? I'll say, it won't be the same around here without him. - Who'll chase us? - 'Right.' You're irreplaceable, Dibble. Nobody will ever bug us like you do. We've had our good times and bad but believe me.. ...I'll never forget you. My tires! You stole 'em. 'I'll throw the book at you!' Fellas, have you no shame? It's the man's last day. The least we can do is give him a farewell present. Chooch! boing Look at it this way, Dibble. You'll be the only retired cop with two spare tires. [Dibble grunting] [melancholic music] (Benny) 'It's only been a couple of days since Dibble retired, T.C.' Aren't we jumpin' the gun a little? You know the old sayin', Benny. When the cat's away, we gypsies make the hay. Okay, so I guess we better rehearse before the real customers show up. (Benny) 'Tell me my fortune, gypsy.' [Benny snickering] Have you thought about switchin' to tea leaves? Quiet, I'm concentratin'. 'Yes, yes. I see riches.' Immense riches coming your way. You really do? Immense riches? Would I lie to you? Very immense. But before that, you will meet a tall, dark stranger. A tall, dark stranger? Maybe it'll be Magic Johnson. [door opens] [Benny gasps] Pardon me, gentlemen, I'm looking for Mr. Ball. - I've been told he's here. - Uh, Benny the Ball? - Yeah, that's ri.. - Quiet! He may be a bunco squad. Who are you, and what do you want with Benny? The name's Sid Buckman. Of Buckman Buckman Buckman and Cash. We're lawyers. Lawyers? That's even worse, they're probably suing ya. Uh, Mr. Ball isn't here. He's visitin' some spirits. - 'Right, T.C.' - Unfortunate. Because Mr. Ball's been named in a will. A will? Benny's in a will? What did I tell ya? Your luck has changed. Yes, well, obviously he knew the late Mrs. Vandergelt alias the bag lady of Beverly Hills. That poor old lady passed away? Oh, that's really sad. I liked her. Well, we have to go sometime, Benny. Did you say Mrs. Vandergelt? "The" Mrs. Vandergelt? Yes, heiress to the Vandergelt diamond mines. She was worth billions. ka-ching klttt klttt klttt ka-ching As your new manager I intend to be at your side during this entire period of stress. Gee, I never needed a manager before, T.C. Of course you didn't, but an innocent potential billionaire 'like yourself deserves to be protected' against unscrupulous money grabbers. Any chance of readin' the will now? A lil' preview of things to come. Ow! That would be completely unethical. Of course. Just testin' you. He's gonna play hardball. I'll be reading the will at noon at the Vandergelt mansion in Beverly Hills. It's like I've always said.. Where there's a will, there's a way. And here we are in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Beverly Hills. Megabucks Drive. 'Some of the biggest names in show business live here.' More celebrities per square inch than Forest Lawn. Heh heh. 'The most expensive estate in all of Beverly Hills.' 'The fabulous Vandergelt mansion.' On your toes, fellas. It's the last stop before fame and fortune. If that's the case, T.C. why didn't we spring for the bus fare? (Top Cat) Because until the will is read Benny is still a pauper, like all of us. Thanks, T.C. And believe me, money will never change me. Speak for yourself. Yes, Mr. Top Cat and party have arrived for the reading of Vandergelt's will. (Officer Dibble) 'Oh, yeah? Ain't that thrilling?' How you guys made the list, I'll never know. Dibble! You retired. What're you doin' here? Oh, just wakin' to keep out the riff-raff. Like yourself. - Oh, is that so? Are you Riff? - No, I'm Raff. Riff couldn't make it. [all laughing] Very funny. Very funny. Now, get up to the mansion before I get nasty. You mean, this isn't the Vandergelt mansion? (Officer Dibble) 'Shows what you deadbeats know.' This is the gate house.There's the mansion. [fanfare music] [all exclaiming] [yawning] Fellas, please, try to rember, this is Beverly Hills. Not some alley in the valley. [smooth jazz music] klink klink klink Believe me, the only difference between us and rich people is that they have money. 'Afternoon. Mr. Top Cat, I presume, and his merry mercenaries. And of course, you are the late Mrs. Vandergelt's butler. Snerdly. I never shake hands with strangers. Germs, you know. (Snerdly) 'R-Rasputin!' [muttering in Russian] Oh, yeah, nothin' like havin' a dog to kill the germs. Gee, a genuine Russian wolfhound. He's beautiful. Hi, Rasputin. [muttering in Russian] Easy. I knew his father Ivan the Terrible. It's nearly time to read the will. Of course. We wouldn't want them to be later, would we, Rasputin? [muttering in Russian] Yeah, there's nothin' like a warm welcome. [alarm blaring] The late Mrs. Vandergelt was very security conscious. [chuckles] Yeah, just a few skeleton keys. Never know when I might find a skeleton in the closet. [muttering in Russian] (Top Cat) 'Yeah?' Well, your mother sniffs trees. Come. They're waiting for you in the drawing room. Gee, if I had known that I would've brought my crayons. Well, guys, now you know why all the wealth is in Beverly Hills. 'They never throw anything out.' Yeah. If we had this stuff, T.C., we could give up show business. [muttering in Russian] (Snerdly) 'Not much further, gentlemen.' Beverly Hills? This is Beverly Alps. What a joint! So far it's been nothin' but drawing rooms music rooms, game rooms. Personally, I'm lookin' for a restroom. gong gong gong Noon. Just in time. whirrr Good. Now that we're all here, I can begin reading the will. May I introduce Mr. Benny the Ball whose bravery gave Mrs. Vandergelt a few extra days of life. [all booing] Gosh! What did I do wrong? Never mind that bunch of greedy money grabbers. 'Just take the cash and run.' (Buckman) 'Quiet, please.' 'The will reads as follows.' As the sole heir to the Vandergelt fortune may I thank you all for coming today. I told you she was a nice lady. Uh-huh. A genuine Renoir, five million. A rare Picasso, one million three. 'A well done Van Gogh.' How come you know so much about paintin'? 'Cause a lot of important people have given me the brush. Ha ha ha. Yeah, well, nothin' like a little gaiety. Look at this little fox. Wonder who she is. I hereby, leave everything I own to my dear, long-lost niece Amy Vandergelt. Well, you win some, you lose some. Mrs. Vandergelt hated her other relatives. 'With Amy out of the way, everything reverts to us.' [snickering] However, since she is missing I hereby name as my sole beneficiary Mr. Benjamin Ball. Benjamin Ball! That's our Benny. She left everything to him. He's gonna be a billionaire. It's the old rags-to-riches story. Right. Except, Benny could never afford the rags. [all booing] Gee, Benny, now that you're a billionaire does that mean you'll pay up the dime you owe me? This has gotta be a dream, fellas, I don't believe it. You bet you don't, you little feline fake. We'll get you for this. [Rasputin growling] I guess he's all out of kibble. (Buckman) 'But in the event that anything unforeseen happens to Mr. Ball' within the next 48 hours the entire estate reverts to Snerdly 'and his faithful pet.' Hear that? If something happens to that little.. (Snerdly) 'Forty eight hours. He should only live so long.' You're practically a billionaire, Benny. If you had the money now, we could afford a celebration. Not to worry, gentlemen. Perhaps Mr. Ball would care to celebrate withhors d'oeuvres in the drawing room. Yeah, maybe you and thishors d'oeuvres character will be big buddies. Wow! This place is larger than the alley. And a lot cleaner too. Wonder where the guys are. I told them to take their time, Mr. Ball. You're the host. You should be the first to try these. Thanks, Snerdly, don't mind if I do. [muttering in Russian] Gee, these will put you away. We can only hope so, Mr. Ball. May I propose a toast to your health? (Top Cat) I'll buy that. thud Mm-mm. Don't you just love the service? It's so unobtrusive. Benny, if I were you, I'd move into this mansion. There's nothin' like being close to your fortune. (Benny) 'I don't know, T.C., I'd miss the alley too much.' crash Well, let's get Snerdly's opinion. What do you think about Benny here movin' in with you? What? You mean give up the alley? We think it's a splendid idea. Don't we, Rasputin? ruff [muttering in Russian] slurp slurp Come and enjoy the good life with us, Mr. Ball.. ...as long as you live. (Top Cat) 'Call him Benny like we do.' Which is why I don't wanna move, T.C. 'I'll miss you and the guys too much.' Tell you what, bein' you feel this way why don't we all move in with you? Really? You'd leave the alley just to be here with me? - Sure, why not. - That's right. (Top Cat) 'It's unanimous.' We'll forsake our charming ancestral home because you need us. Gee, I don't know what to say, T.C. How can I ever repay you? With this pussycat worth a couple of mil. This'll be fine. But don't forget to gift wrap it. vroom [upbeat music] vroom Well, we did it, troops. Who says you can't pack and move in an hour? (Benny) 'Gee, T.C., I can't believe it.' We're actually gonna live in Beverly Hills. As I said when those Siamese moved next door there goes the neighborhood. [muttering in Russian] Capitalist cats. Never fear. They'll need every one of their nine lives. [laughing] How do we get him to let us in? No problem, Chooch. It's just a matter of using the latest technology. You know what they say, reach out and touch someone. (Top Cat) 'Open up, gatekeeper.' T.C. and party are joinin' the beautiful people. Dibble! Obviously this isn't one of them. 'Dibble, how nice to see that you've lasted on the job.' It just goes to show ya how diligence and perseverance can.. Like they say, you can take the cat out of the can but you can't take the can out of the cat or not. Listen up, smarty cat. There's no way you're movin' in with that pile. How can you speak that way about him? Especially to his manager. My card. (Dibble) '"Beverly Hills Express?"' - Where did you get this? - 'An actor with a big schnoz.' He said not to leave the alley without one. Now, if you'll please. Thank you, my good man. 'A little somethin' for your trouble.' My old police badge. No wonder I couldn't find it. Top Cat! Unh-unh, Dibble. We're guests. Don't make me call the cops. [grunting] [cheering and laughter] Wake me up, I'm dreamin'. Whee! 'Come on in, T.C., you'll feel like a new cat.' No, thanks, I'm happy just sittin' here trollin' for smoked salmon. Hey, I got one! I got one! It's a trophy for sure. Oh, boy! Oh, boy! 'Oh, boy!' Now, I know why I flunked out of scuba school. Come on, Brain, get off. boing boing boing Brain, remind me to ask if this mansion has a dungeon. (Brain) 'Sorry, T.C.' Now, if you'd just help me off with this wet suit. Hey, it's pinching me. Let go. Sorry. [Snerdly screaming] [snoring] (Benny) 'Huh? Wha..? Okay, ma, I'll get a job in the morning.' Oh, it's you, Snerdly. I'm just not used to wake-up calls. Your yuppie dog, sir. And then you can enjoy a refreshing dip in the pool. Thanks, but no thanks. 'If you swim right after eating' 'you could get a terrible bellyache and drown.' You're jesting. We wouldn't want that to happen to a potential billionaire, would we? Especially during the next 48 hours. - Right, Rasputin? - Absolutsky. [muttering in Russian] The truth is, Snerdly, I can't swim a stroke. No problem. We can deal with that. Oh, boatman! Boatman! (Benny) 'Titanic II. Hmm. Where've I heard that name before?' (Snerdly) 'Just sail away, Master Ball' 'and your troubles will disappear.' And so will you. whizz Aloha, Benny. [all bidding farewell] What'd I tell you, he's taken to Beverly Hills like a fish takes to water. Hm, according to this Bawl Street Journal the best way to make a killing is in life insurance. Blah! It's a shark! Help! Help! SOS! I'll give him help. Help! [gurgling] If I don't catch somethin' pretty soon we'll have to open a can of tuna. Got one! Chooch, get the scales. Quick. - Here's the scale, T.C. - 'And here's the fish.' boing Definitely not edible but maybe we can have him stuffed and mounted. Ruin our plan, will they? Well, I'll show them. Uh-oh. Yeow! [snickering] Numbskullsky. Gee, thanks for savin' my life, T.C. What're friends for, Benny? Like I always say do unto others and comes an inheritance they'll do unto you. Unless of course, they're ungrateful wretches. That's beautiful, T.C. Wish I had thought of that. (Top Cat) 'No chance.' Speaking of chances, maybe somebody's out to scare Benny so he won't stick around for his money. Like, even worse. They could be plannin' his trip to the big alley in the sky. (Benny) 'You really think so?' Somebody would want me out of the way? Stop scarin' him, guys. All he has to do is stay healthy for the next two days. thump thump thump Go easy on the tacos. This calls for a workout in the vault. 'There's nothin' like lifting gold bars to keep you in shape.' - Your bill. - Thanks, doc. I'll pay you right after I collect what's comin' to me. [dramatic music] Yes, Rasputin, this will all be ours. But not until we deal with that conniving Benny and his pals. They'll stop at nothing. Hmm. Decisions, decisions, decisions. [muttering in Russian] Yeah, Benny, there's nothin' like shuffleboard to make you wonder what we ever saw in mud wrestlin'. tonk tonk tonk tonk (Top Cat) And to think I never played this before. (Benny) 'Nice shot, T.C.' You're a real pro. I know, but none of the shuffleboard teams will meet my price. Which reminds me, it's way past our meal time. Attention, staff, Top Cat, here. Time for a snack on the patio. 'The usual brunch for 40 guests, something fine.' 'Over and out.' Those pushy paupers. We'll attend to them. 'No, you fool. Too obvious.' [gunshot] [grunting] [screaming] What Master Ball needs is one of my special herb salads. It does wonders for the digestion. 'After this he'll never bite just anything again.' [both laughing] Step back. The MAD chef of Beverly Hills is doing his thing. pop pop pop [muttering in Russian] When're we gonna eat, T.C.? I'm famished with hunger. Me too. The last time I was this hungry I stuffed my tail in the microwave. Be patient, fellas. This isn't a fast food joint. slurp The rich thrive on slow food. Any slower and I'm gonna pass out. (Snerdly) 'Bruncheon is served.' [all cheering] 'Hurray!' Pardon the delay, gentlemen. But my salada la Benjamin took time. You hear that, Benny? They named a salad after you. That's class. Real class. If this was a welcome wagon, I'd run 'em over. Uh, may I fix your wagon? Oh, I mean, may I serve you, Master Ball? Why, yes. Thank you. I'll do it. We're buddies. Oh, no. There goes my herb salad. splash Now I know where Snerdly gets his lettuce. 'The toxic waste dump.' boom splash Whoever bottles that dressin' could conquer the world. You! You! A toast to Benny's continued good health and our future prosperity. (together) Yay, Benny! Gee, what a nice gesture, fellas. And you too, Snerdly, for treatin' me like this. To Master Benny. May he get exactly what's coming to him. ♪ For he's a jolly good feline ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good feline ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good feline ♪ ♪ We'll all split up the loot ♪ Aye! In a matter of hours, that pudgy pushy cat gets our inheritance. I say it's time to take off the gloves. [dramatic music] [laughing] thud [laughing] Outta sight! One for the books. Blindfolded! I'll never get over it. Like, tell us, T.C., how did you ever do it? Just a little somethin' I picked up from my teacher. Maybe you heard of him. (together) 'Minnesota Cats.' Gee! All these Beverly Hills murders mostly rich people done in by their faithful servants. Don't believe it. Where can you find faithful servants today? boom You think the book was somethin' wait'll you see the movie. But Benny's life could be in jeopardy, T.C. Yeah. Remember, he doesn't collect his inheritance until midnight, tomorrow. Or is it the day after tomorrow? Quiet. You're all lettin' your imaginations limited as they are, run away with you. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Not with us around to protect ya. I appreciate that, but something tells me 'that Snerdly, the butler, has it in for me.' Benny, you've been watchin' too many old murder mysteries on TV. 'The butler doesn't do it anymore.' [Snerdly groaning] (T.C.) 'Maybe the dog, but not the butler.' grrr What was that? 'Maybe it was somethin' she ate.' The truth is, I really don't deserve this fortune. It was left to her. Yeah, but "her" isn't around to collect. It's not your fault. But supposin' somethin' happened to Amy. I'd feel guilty. [groaning] Now, which would you rather be, guilty or poor? Believe me, if anything's wrong, it'll all come out in the wash. [smooth jazz music] [Amy sniffling] I guess I'm lucky to have found a job, even this. Now, now, Amy, no more tears. The salt can damage my paint job. Sorry, but when will I be allowed to visit dear old Aunt Gertrude? Maybe tomorrow. Get the white Vols. ♪ So I'll just wait for tomorrow ♪ ♪ Tomorrow tomorrow ♪ Next! Now you know why she's an orphan. Sir, about that bonus I was promised. (Snerdly) 'Yes, good news.' 'I've spoken to the manager' and tomorrow during lunch you can give yourself a free hot wax. [Snerdly laughing] I could run away, but then I'd miss the annual carwash picnic. (male #3) 'And here we are in person' 'at the fabulous Vandergelt Mansion.' Lester Pester with Lifestyles of The Rich and Furry. And this morning, we're going to meet Beverly Hills' most extravagant playboys. Glad to see ya. We're ahead by two touchdowns. The colorful, eccentric leader of the cat pack himself. The legendary, T.C. Ha ha ha. Yes. The Rich and Furry really know how to have a ball. Ow! Sorry about that Lester, but polo's a dangerous sport. Especially in the drawing room. Uh, but where are the goals? In the bedroom, by the hockey rink. [horse neighing] T.C., there's an old saying in Beverly Hills.. If you've got it, flaunt it. There's another old saying.. If you don't have it, borrow it. [horse neighing] [gasps] My solid gold wristwatch. You've been taken, pal. This is an obvious imitation from the streets of Calcutta. Fore! You missed, T.C. Ha ha. [telephone ringing] Hole in one, Lester baby. [ringing continues] Thanks, Chooch. Probably my stock broker. T.C. here. Right. Buy up all the stock. I'm takin' over the phone company. Hello? Hello? How do you like that, they cut me off again. Ah! Bein' wealthy is such a downer. Ha ha ha. Then I gather that you and your cohorts 'miss the good old days back in the alley?' True. And that's why I've arranged a little surprise. Way to go! Back to our roots! Yeah. Like really back. sniff sniff Yeah. That's like a breath of stale here. The only thing missing is Dibble. Where do you think you are? This is Beverly Hills, not the Bronx. Get rid of this trash. Next time, bite you tongue. Dibble, my dear man, what a pleasure to see that you're still alive. For your information, thisgarbage is imported. And for your information, you're gonna be deported. I don't know how your audience feels but this is an insult to The Rich and Furry. Speaking of billions, T.C. when do we get to meet the potential heir in person? Forget it. Mr. Benny the Ball's unavailable to the media. 'He's too busy tourin' the estate.' [panting] I didn't realize that rich people have to exercise. You really think it'll make me feel better? Not only that, Master Ball it's going to makeme feel better. grrr [muttering in Russian] [screaming] crash Good work, Rasputin. We've seen the last of that little spunger. crash Help! Help! I can't stop! boom gulp Don't count us out. There's more than one way to skin a fat cat. [humming] Now, this is my idea of a workout, Snerdly. If you want you can speed it up a little. You took the words right out of my mouth. '"Super Sonic." Go for it.' Hey, wait. Not so fast. Slow it down! Aah! [both laughing] [electrical cackling] boom [all coughing] [panting] That's it for me. I gotta get the weight off my feet. How did I ever let you talk me into this? These weights are a pain. True. But in the immortal words of the Marquette Swatsenberg.. There's no gain without pain. Ha ha. Higher, higher. Hey, isn't that too heavy? Heavy? A mere 1000 pounds? 'It'll do wonders for you.' [grunting] [grunting] crash crash A good massage will take out all the kinks. If you say so. But frankly I'm not into kinky. Pressure pointskys. Ha ha ha. Yeow! I'm all twisted up. Make a wish. Who taught you guys massage? Attila the Hun? Ha ha ha. Wrong. Oliver Twist. Yeow! Now, now, Master Ball, you're too tense. Learn how to relax. I've never taken a hot sauna bath before. No sweat. It'll relieve all your tensions. [snickering] (Snerdly) 'Hard boiled, yes. That should suffice.' Hey, yeah, this feels good. The tensionsare disappearing. And so am I. It's locked. They've locked me in. No, they wouldn't be that fiendish. Open up, you fiends! Hey, Benny, are you in here? I've been lookin' all over. Only 24 more hours, kid. Do you hear that? 24 more hours and you'll be one of the fat cats. [gasps] What the.. No way,jose, take me home to the alley. Benny, you know what this means? Instead of bein' a billionaire, you'll end up with small change. I wanna go home, T.C. I'm just not meant for life in the fast lane. [engine revving] You can say that again. What do they do for an encore? thud One thing about Beverly Hills, when they try to terminate you they do it with class. Yeah, guys, I've come to the conclusion that Snerdly's out to get Benny. I'll buy that. But, T.C., I thought you said that the butler doesn't do it anymore. 'Even your leader makes mistakes once in a while, Chooch.' Nobody's perfect. Even me. 'The important thing is to make sure Benny stays alive' 'or he loses his inheritance.' Now, you wouldn't want to do that to your buddies, would you, kid? Believe me, fellas, the last thing in the world I wanna do is cause any more trouble. Did you hear that? That's the kind of team spirit that puts tears in your eyes.. Hey, wait! He's history. Hey, this is great up here. 'I can actually see all of Beverly Hills.' Down, Benny, down. They'll think you're a peeping tom. What will we do now, T.C.? I don't know. But this is all my fault. Aw. Don't take it so hard. He'll come back. [sniveling] Maybe. But in the meantime, he has no life insurance. [sobbing] On the other hand, knowin' Benny is like havin' money in the bank. (Snerdly) Black magic is the answer. If we don't get rid of that little scrounge soon we'll be peddling apples on Rodeo Drive. [grunting] Why experiment? Let's stay with the tried and true. Aah! It's him, Master Benny. Whoever said that crime doesn't pay never went to butler school. Ta-ta, Master Ball. Yeow! I'm hit. Look out below. Oh, no. Our bank's about to fail. Quick, guys, the trampoline! - Over here. - No, there. - Come on this way. - No, that way. Don't worry. Over here, Benny. Make up your mind, fellas. I haven't got all day. [dramatic music] Come on back, Brain, you forgot somethin'. Talk about nerdsville. Let's boogie. [ricocheting] boing (Top Cat) 'We got ya.' Don't panic. Easy does it. boing This is getting repetious. Benny, will you come down to earth? boing Hurry up, guys, he's leavin' the premises. One thing about Benny, he's always had his ups and downs. 'Looks like he's on his way down.' (Brain) 'Yeah, and if we don't catch him, it's bye-bye Benny. ' And it's bye-bye to the big bucks. Come on, guys, we gotta save him. boing Hate to be a party poop, T.C., but this is getting frustrating. And I'm getting tired. (Chooch) 'Yeah, me too.' If one of us doesn't grab him soon it'll be nighttime and I need mybeauty sleep. Come on, Benny, quit foolin' around. Who's foolin' around? - 'Who needs this?' - Yeah. Where's the good in savin' his life if he won't hang around? For once, Brain, I'm with you. You're wearin' out your welcome, Benny. We've taken a poll. boing So have I, a flagpole. What do we do now, T.C.? Well, either we all stand in attention and salute or we get him down. Hold on, Benny. We're lookin' for ideas. No hurry, fellas. I'm beginning to like it up here. The air is nice and fresh, and the view is terrific. Uh-oh! [screaming] You're disturbin' the peace. What's goin' on here? [screaming] Just in time, Dibble. Nice goin'. Yeah. Thanks, Dibble, I couldn't have done it without you. boing [mumbling] Way to go, Dibble. Guard him with your life. [upbeat music] You wanted a party, you're partyin'. [fingers snapping] Good day, mate, put another shrimp on the barbie. Ow! Ooh! Eek. I said shrimp, not simp. Get off that. [all laughing] [upbeat music] (male #4) 'Hey, will you settle down there? We're trying to sleep.' And now, let's pay tribute to the guy that made this all possible. Our young, generous heir-to-be, Benny the Ball. [all cheering] Don't you just love rich people, they're so giving. It seems like such a waste, T.C. I mean, they've thrown out everything but the kitchen sink. thud What's the matter up there? He said kitchen sink. What do you know, it must be the maid's night off. Not only are they giving our city a bad name, but even worse look how they're catering to that little fleabag. snarl snarl [muttering] Think of it this way, Benny. You're not only our devoted friend and companion 'but you're our meal ticket. ' I appreciate the sentiment, fellas 'but I'm still not entitled to anything.' Uh-oh! Here we go again. What I'm sayin' is, that somewhere, some place there's a little girl named Amy who's the rightful heir. Amy shmamy. Why corrupt her with money? She's better off without it. (male #5) 'Come on, little orphan, Amy, move it. I need my wheels.' I just know there's a better life out there with a home and a fireplace. Where did I go wrong? For openers, you're always whing. Plus, you never stop leaving streaks on the windshield. [crying] Look at it this way, kid, things could be worse. 'It could be Christmas.' [upbeat music] [laughing] We'll never get rid of that little ball as long as T.C.'s around to protect him. [snarling] Time's running out on our inheritance. To get rid of Benny, we'll have to divert his greedy leader. How, how? Ha ha ha. By bringing in my secret irresistible weapon. Kitty Glitter. The real meowish princess. 'Have we got the cats for her!' [instrumental music] (Kitty Glitter) 'Yes, this is the gorgeous' 'glamorous Kitty Glitter speaking.' Go on a date with whom? Top Cat? Never heard of him. Believe me, Ms. Glitter, he's the toast of the alley. Alley? Y-yuck! Gee, ew. Geographically undesirable. Argh! You don't understand, Ms. Glitter. Top Cat's one of the wealthiest bachelors in town. [sniggering] He is? What sign was he born under? Don't tell me, the dollar sign. [instrumental music] mwah Anything for love. Oh, I almost forgot my perfume. The Eau de Catnip. [ambient music] We'll do lunch. The Vandergelt Mansion? Outrageous. I'll pick Top Cat up as soon as I'm dressed. Let's see. What do I wear for a rendezvous 'with a rich, eligible bachelor?' [dramatic music] I've waited years for this. Mirror, mirror on the wall may he be single, loaded, and tall. ["Here Comes The Bride" playing] Do you, Kitty, take this wealthy Beverly Hills' billionaire with three sports cars, a condo, and a Jacuzzi to be your lawfully wedded hubby? I do! I do! I do! You beautiful Beverly Hills princess, you. 'He'll be on cloud nine.' [harp music] Kitty Glitter, huh? What do you think of her, Chooch? She's gotta be a ten. Why worry about her IQ? She's lovely, she's chic, she's available. I'm thrilled, sir. You two deserve each other. Thanks for fixin' me up, Snerdly. I guess I was wrong about you. What are servants for, sir? Enjoy your date. I'm Cupid, he's stupid. Now we can deal with Master Benny without further interference. [dramatic music] [rattling] 'A mace, how primitive.' Now, I have something in mind that'll really put Benny away. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Gee, Dibble, I really feel secure knowing that you're here to protect me. All part of the job, Benny. Remember, I was once the best cop that money could buy. How true. Even Brain knows that. Hey, this water skiing's the greatest. Only next time, Brain, you should try 'em with waterskies. Look at it this way. It keeps him off the street. Hey, now that's what you call scenery. Wowie-zow! She looks like a TV star. No, it couldn't be. Lassie has more fur. Brain, the tow rope. Watch where you're going, doofus. Ya-hoo! Don't tell me, it's either O.J. Simply or the fabulous Top Cat. Well, as a matter of fact I'm-- The most gorgeous hunk I've ever seen. Let's move out, lover cat. [engine revving] Rodeo Drive. I'm sure you know it well, T.C. Well, to tell you the truth, Ms. Glitter-- Glitter? Call me Kitty. You're gonna love the Velvet Whisker. It's so trendy. A pet shop. Gee, I wonder if I could rent a rat. Rent a rat? Honey! What you need is a special someone to help chose a new wardrobe. I do? I thought the old rag picker was doin' fine. It's you. The latest thing from Calvin Swine. Genuine Malibu mink. [laughing] We'll take it. Now that he's in for all that scratch nothing's too expensive. Speakin' of scratch, you wouldn't have anything in a way of designer flea powder? Fleas! thud Guess they were closing early. Where to next? My psychiatrist. But then again you might get fleas on his couch. Ah! What I won't do for love. I can't get over this. Me, the legendary T.C. stood up by a blind date. Kitty's only an hour late, T.C. Maybe she got stuck in traffic. With her looks, she might have even stopped traffic. I dunno, guys, maybe I'm losin' it. Maybe you never had it. There goes your tip. Every minute she's late brings that miserable Benny closer to our inheritance. 'Very creative.' Wherever Ms. Glitter is, she'd better get her act together. You drive me insane. Absolutely insane. Thanks. The last one who said that was my mother. I was teachin' her to drive. Whee! Now you're talkin'. Sports car. Let's order two cars. A his and a hers. Then we'll go to City Hall and get our license. Good idea. I've always wanted a driver's license. 'But I keep flunking the test.' [tires screeching] [screaming] [horn blaring] [tires screeching] Sir, about your order. Better make that three cars. His, hers, and a spare. p-taff That'll happen if you don't use your seat belt. D'oh! I knew you was crazy about me, but not this crazy. [ambient music] May I suggest Chez Puss' specialty of the day? And may I suggest more of menus written in English? But,monsieur, this is a French restaurant. thud I'll start out with some French fries for the main course 'and for dessert, French fries.' 'Heavy on the grease.' You would know the rich, they're all on special diets. We'll start with the fish tartare. The bouillabaisse. - Call for you, Ms. Glitter. - Thank you,monsieur. Oui. The fabulous Kitty here. Where are you, Ms. Fabulous? I've been calling all over Beverly Hills. (Kitty) 'I'm with T.C. You never said he was a mental case.' To us. Two ships that sink in the night. He's not T.C.? You mean I'm out with an imposter? That explains it! Hurray, soup's hot. I'll take some of that. My pleasure,T.C.! Oh, I'm not T.C., I'm.. splash All wet. slurp Hmm. Not bad. Could use some pepper. Aah. Aah. Aah.. Your check, sir. [sneezes] thud [speaking French] Forget the cake, I'll go for the cookie. A costume party, what a great idea, Snerdly. Master Benny will inherit his estate at midnight tonight. 'So, why not celebrate?' I'm all for it. Waterloo, here I come. Like, I've always wanted to be Cleopatra. Ha ha ha. You're costume Sphinx. We were wrong about him, gang. He's not the creep we thought he was. Don't forget to show up tonight for the party. - Oh, we'll be there. - Let's go, guys. We gotta practice our big number. Yeah, like, I'm outta here. Gone. Nobody gave me a costume. What am I gonna wear? (Snerdly) I have a little surprise for you. A surprise? We found a costume that's got your name on it. A dog's head! I always wondered what it was like to be a mutt. Here's your chance to find out. Try it on for size. Ha ha ha. woof woof woof Aha! This is fun. I'll be the life of the party. woof woof woof You don't know the half of it, Mr. Bowser. Ha ha ha.

Somebody call the police. There's a mad dog attackin' me. Help! Boy! I sure fooled old Brain. He really thinks I'm a dog. He he he! 'Stop laughing, you nasty mutt.' You ate poor Benny. I hope you get a belly ache. woof woof woof That does it. Now I'm mad. [peppy music] Nobody eats my best friend and gets away with it. woof woof screech Come on down, you pesky pooch! woof woof woof grr grr Hey! Wait a minute. Something's wrong. Dogs don't climb trees. grr grr Oops! Right! They fall out of them. That voice. It's so familiar. Who are you? I'll give you a clue. What has four paws, a tail and goes meow? Let me see now. I got it! - A cat! - 'Way to go, Brain.' Thanks, Top Cat. I'd know you anywhere. 'Top Cat?' It's me, Brain, Benny. Take a good look. Yeah, yeah. It's you, alright. I could tell by your catnip breath. That's it. No more mister nice guy. twang What do you got to say now, Brain? I guess you could say I'm putting out the dog. woof woof woof Ha ha ha!

Beverly Hills dog pound. This is a concerned citizen. There's a mongrel roaming the Vandergelt estate. A mongrel here in Beverly Hills? Impossible! grr woof woof woof Be here tonight to collect him and we'll make it worth your while. flap flap flap I, uh, I get the message, sir. You can count on me. He won't get away! Dobey, we're gonna have a new guest for the isolation cell. 'Gas up the van.' grr [mellow music] Now, this is what you call a wild party. Two kinds of mustard. woof Nothing like putting on a dog. These costumes Snerdly gave us are like far out. Especially his! What do you think, fellas? I think I just lost my appetite. Great costume, Dibble. What are you supposed to be? An ex-cop who's sick of playing nice mate to you clowns. Geez! You don't have to get so personal. Hey, I'm glad we finally got together, Kitty. It was destiny. It's been my ambition to meet somebody like you, T.C. Somebody with charm and sophistication.. ...and money! I know what you mean. Just a couple of hours and we cash in our chips. It's almost time for our big surprise number. We're dedicating it to Benny. I still haven't met this potential billionaire. Where is he? (Top Cat) 'Over there. Havin' his dinner.' Atta boy, Benny. Sit. 'Roll over.' Atta boy. Now, beg. Beg! [dramatic music] crash What a mess. But he can afford it. Yeah. Like Benny's beggin' days are almost over. Soon they'll all be beggars. Da! Beggar-ski.

Like I say, the tourists are all anxious to meet you. 'They want autographs.' Autographs, huh? Well, if they're really fans of mine.. Let's not keep them waiting. Their tour bus is parked by the gate. Snerdly's missing too, T.C. It looks suspicious. He'll do anything to get rid of Benny. Let's go, guys. The party's over. [instrumental music] [all screaming] They're waiting right over here, Master Ball. It's so dark. I can't see the tour bus. (Snerdly) 'Here it comes now!' screech (male #6) 'Gotcha, you mongrel.'

I hope he hasn't step on Benny. (Choo-Choo) 'Uh-oh!' What's all this racket about? Dibble, have you seen Benny? We can't find him. All I saw was a dogcatcher's van and it took right off. Oh! Is that all? Let's go, fellas, keep lookin'.. Dogcatcher's van? [dramatic music] Sure. All you have to do is put two and two together. It means Benny's been catnapped. That sneaky Snerdly set him up. What did I tell you about butlers? If Benny's not back by midnight, he's out all the money. What do you mean he's out? There's only one thing to do. We burst into the pound and spring Benny. You're puttin' me on, T.C. Us raiding a dog pound? Like, it's a suicide mission and we're the suicidees. You're right, we need advice. [dramatic music] beep beep beep Hello? Information? Give me Sly Stallone. [snoring] There're mongrels in Beverly Hills. [mumbling] snore [drum roll] I'll never get out of here. Nobody knows where I am. How long have you been in? Since I was a puppy. [dramatic music] screech I don't know about this, T.C. Borrowing the late Mrs. Vandergelt's car. Perfectly legal. It's gonna be hours once Benny get's his inheritance. Where's Brain? A-okay, chief. All equipment accounted for. Rope, ladder, crowbar.. 'Where's the file? I told you to bring a file.' You got it. He's amazing. Meantime, what do we do about freeing Benny? According to "Famous Dog Pounds" 'his cage should be right about here.' wup-wup-wup clang Okay, Chooch, up you go. Why me? You've seen all those prison pictures? The guys always draw straws. Okay, let's draw straws. [instrumental music] Here's mine. Forget it, Brain. I'll go. But if I'm not back in ten minutes take off without me. [instrumental music] [blubbering] Yeah! Over and out. knock knock knock Benny? Benny, we're here to spring you. [grunting] squeak crash (dog catcher) 'Surprise!' Oh, really, fellas. You shouldn't have. We're so glad you dropped in, pussycat. Yeah. Well, I think visiting hours are over. [peppy music] (Top Cat) 'Over here, warden.' 'You dopey Dobey.' For shame. That's no way to talk about man's best friend. Escape! Seal off the exits! Glad to see ya. Anybody here know Benny? [peppy music] I take it you haven't seen him either. grr [dogs barking] Here kitty, kitty. I wanna put you up for adoption. No, thanks, I'm not house broken. breet After him, Dobey! Up here, T.C! This way! Benny, you saved my life. What are you doing in here? My cellmate told me about this air shaft. It leads to the outside. This is the first time I'm happy to get the shaft. We're out of here! [instrumental music] T.C's been gone almost seven minutes. What do we do? It never hurts to start packing. We better wait for T.C. and Benny. (T.C.) 'I see some light, Benny. We've almost made it.' Yeah, T.C., but all this climbing has made me thirsty. Thirsty, pussycats? Ha ha ha! splash [both screaming] That's it! All in favor of the strategic retreat, say aye. But that means we'd be leaving T.C. and Benny all alone. I wouldn't say that. [dramatic music] Earthquake! Open the cages! [peppy music] [dogs barking] Now that all the dogs are free we can leave with a clear conscience. [panting] Yeah, except that my dogs are getting tired. [music continues] Are you two looking for a ride? The Vandergelt mansion and hurry. It's a matter of life and bucks! Right, T.C. screech Talk about being in a dog house! They'll pay for this! [siren wailing] Clean getaway, fellas. Just leave it to your legendary leader. We better hurry, legendary, before Benny loses his inheritance to Snerdly. That lawyer Buckman will be at the mansion by now. As a great president once said "We got nothing to fear but fear itself." [siren wailing] On the other hand, he never broke out of a dog pound. Better take a detour. [siren wailing] tick tock tick tock Only 15 more minutes to midnight, Mr. Buckman. Yes. If Mr. Benny the Ball doesn't show up soon everything goes to you. Isn't it a shame? I wonder what happened to him. Ha ha ha! [dramatic music] Uh-oh! The dirty dogcatcher is catching up with us. 'This calls for evasive action.' 'Chooch, hard right at the carwash.' (Amy) 'Tomorrow! Tomorrow! We're open tomorrow!' Sorry, sir, we're closed until morning. Now, what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this? If I was you, I'd hang out in the pool room. Pardon me, miss, haven't I seen you somewhere before? That's a pretty old line, Benny. But it just might work. Hold it! Benny's right! Your portrait's hanging in the Vandergelt mansion. You're Amy, Mrs. Vandergelt's missing niece. Where have you been? Cleaning windshields, thanks to my benefactor Snerdly. How's dear aunty Gertrude? Good news and bad news. The good news is that your aunty loves you. The bad news is that she's up at the country club in the sky. [sobbing] You mean, she's.. (all) Uh-huh! What T.C. forgot to tell you, Amy, is that you're the heiress to a big fortune! I was saving it for a surprise. If we don't get back to the mansion the only one with glut will be Snerdly. Knowing him, he's not the kind that likes to share. Well, what are we standing around for? Beam me up, Scottie. (dog catcher) 'Freeze, fugitives! Ha ha ha!' Any last words? Uh, yes. Do you take bribes? Do we take bribes? Yeah. You know, loot, shekels, moolah, bread? Well, how do you think I pay for tennis lessons? Uh, speakin' of lessons, you connivers deserve one. Sic 'em, Dobey! grr Just as I'd thought. That dollar doesn't buy anything these days. Except a trip through the carwash! Yeow! Nice goin', Amy. You saved our tails. He he! Besides givin' him the brush. splash [burbling] Argh! I will.. Gee, I wonder if he qualifies for the free hot wax? Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Hot wax, tomorrow! tick tock tick tock What are we singin' about? Ten more minutes and Snerdly inherits a fortune. That wouldn't be fair to Amy. The estate belongs to her. Thanks! But I'd much rather have love than money. Is that so? Well, you're loved, Amy. So, come on, let's go get the money. [instrumental music] screech tick tock tick tock Ha ha ha! Just another few minutes until party time. [muttering in Russian] I still don't understand what happened to Mr. Benny the Ball? Like the saying goes, "That's the way the ball bounces." Ha ha ha! [crickets chirping] What a time to run out of gas. I mean, don't these rich cheapskates ever fill up their tanks? You're welcome. Keep it up, Brain. The inheritance is going down to tubes. What do we do, T.C.? We're miles from the mansion. By the time we get there, it'll be-- Tomorrow! Tomorrow! We'll get there tomorrow! Please, kid, don't make things worst than they are. vroom Hey, we've lucked out their stopping. Here's where we can catch a ride. Y-yeah, with the dog catcher. Like he'll take us for a ride. Pound city. Well, well, well, look who's roaming around Beverly Hills without their tags on. That's breakin' the law! You're puttin' me on. Did you hear that, gang? Let's go get our tags. Eighty-six, twenty-seven, zero, blitz! vroom [instrumental music] Way to go, money lovers. It's the dash for the cash. Follow me. [dramatic music] Hold it, guys! Danger, eh? Nobody said it would be easy. Now, watch the master. boing boing boing thud I'll never watch the master again. It's too gruesome. Ha ha ha! Talking about weird cats in Beverly Hills. You're the weirdest. A genuine Beverly Hills cop. How quaint. Yeah. I hear you all carry 14 carat handcuffs. And you leave gold plated parking tickets on cars that park in no parking zones. You some kind of wise guy? Officer, have you got the wrong party. I'd love to stay and chat, but we got date with destiny. Tell me, foxy, what's a nice girl like you doing with a fleabag like him? Ha ha ha! Don't tell him. You're liable to incriminate yourself. Plead insanity. Wise guy, huh? How would you like to see our jail? What do you say, gang? Last one back to the mansion gets a tax audit. [dramatic music] The captain's not gonna believe this. Ha ha ha! So why tell him? screech [all panting] We're here. Just in time to beat the deadline. Two more minutes and we can.. smooch smooch smooch ...kiss the money goodbye. Don't say that. It's us, Dibble. Open the gates! Quick! You gotta good case. Beat it! You'repersona non-grata. What does that mean, T.C.? It's a fancy way of saying that we're out in the cold. Now, forget that stupid dog head. Snerdly gave me strict orders. No animals! Period! Aunty Gertrude would have never allowed that. She had a big heart. So does Dibble. Only his is a transplant from Godzilla. What do you say, pal? We'll lose Amy's inheritance. You wouldn't want that to happen, would you? (Top Cat) 'Think of this cute little orphan here' Working her fingers to the bone in a car wash while Snerdly.. [Dibble snoring] Shh! snore I think I got to him. Too late, T.C., It's midnight. [clock bell ringing] (Snerdly) 'Ha ha ha !' 'Twelve o'clock and all's well.' preet preet I obviously have no choice. Being that Amy Vandergelt is missing and that Mr. Ball has disappeared. 'The estate of the deceased thereby goes to..' rumble The party's over. Time for your vacations, Snerdly. How's six to ten in a state pen? That includes time off for bread and water. What is the meaning of this? Wha.. You. You're Amy Vandergelt. She's too late. Everything reverts to us! [muttering] No way. We'll go to court. And enter a plea ofnolo solomea sub rosa contendere. What's that mean, T.C.? It means they got us by the short whiskers. Ha ha ha! No hard feelings, T.C. You and your gang have ten seconds to pack and leave the premises. (Gertrude) 'They'll do nothing of that sort, Snerdly.' You and that horrendous hound have been swindling me. But now, I've got the goods on you. Aunty Gertrude, you're alive and well. [mellow music] Alive, yes. I don't know about the well. Oh, my dear, I've missed you terribly. We'll make up for it. But...but...I was at her funeral. She was.. thud You only thought you saw me. I hired a stand-in to take my place. She hired a standing to.. What can I tell you? This is Beverly Hills. They know how to live. To think I trusted you as my butler! All these years, you've lied and cheated and.. [gasps] He's gone. "So long, suckers! Gone to Rio de Janeiro." Ha ha ha! What's so funny about them getting away to Rio? They'll miss the Mardi Gras. It was last month. Oh! [both laughing] 'Let them call the police. They'll never find us.' Ha ha ha! A perfect disguise. Once we're safe on that plane, I'll get rid of it. Ha ha ha! [instrumental music] [muttering in Russian] sniff sniff It's even got you fooled. Ha ha ha! Cut that out! Your nose is cold. [dramatic music] Hold it, you two! Where do you think you're goin'? woof woof woof What do you think I am? It's you, Benny, still wearing that silly dog's head from the party. [music continues] Ha ha! One thing about being an ex-cop you can't put nothing over on me. woof woof woof We've made it, Rasputin. Let the good times roll. (dog catcher) 'Gotcha, you fugitives!' You're rollin' straight to the pound. [both screaming] (Snerdly) 'Let me go! Frame up.' [instrumental music] Let me out of here! Don't you understand? I'm human. We're human being-ski. [muttering] Ha ha ha! That's what they all say. Two weeks in quarantine should take care of that. Ha ha ha! Oh, no! screech Ouch! Ow! Ooh! Ah! (Snerdly) 'Rasputin, are you alright?' Yeah, yeah, yeah-ski. The doors are open. We're free! Let's beat it with a loot. We've made it! We'll be rich! Rich! Rich! Uh-oh! Run for your life! Top Cat has hired a hit man. Wooh! That was close. Yeah. Close-ski. Cut! Cut! Who hired these actors? They've ruined the take by jumping away from the speeding car. You mean you're making a movie? 'Yeah. Beverly Hills Hospital.' And you were supposed to get run over. Take your place, everybody. We'll go for take two. [dramatic music] I'm sorry, mister, but these are gonna star in a prison comedy called "Beverly Hills Animal Shelter." screech Well, I'm certainly sorry, T.C. that you and the boys have decided to leave us. Huh? What's that? Oh, yeah, we're sorry to leave too, Mrs. V. Real sorry. If you stay, I'll let you play my new toy from Aunty Gertrude. You can take the girl out of the carwash but you can't take the carwash out of the girl. I couldn't have said it better. splash The truth is, ma'am, we're all homesick for the alley. Like we haven't slipped on a bana peel for days. [all laughing] I understand, but meantime, I'd like to have you a token of my appreciation. Oh, no, we couldn't, really. Takin' money that we didn't earn. Never. Well, if that's the way you feel.. slam Yeah, but what do I know? thud thud thud crash Gosh, Mrs. Vandergelt, does this mean we're related? Nice try, Chooch but I think we're out of luck. Forget the money, T.C. There's no better reward than making someone happy. [peppy music] Make me happy and bite your tongue. [music continues] Okay, alley scouts, now that we're out of Beverly Hills let's get down to business. What business? (all) Doing good deeds. I don't hear you. (all) Doing good deeds. What's with you guys? Cat got your tongue? Now you know why he was rejected by the marines. Frankly, T.C., it's not the same around here without Officer Dibble. Yeah. The challenge is gone. Yeah. Like we miss him. I'm with you, just 'cause the man's gone there's no reason why we can't keep his name alive. Hello. Alphonso, send over a deluxe pizza. Yeah and charge it to Dibble. Let's face it. With Dibble away, the lids off. 'We can merge with the syndicate.' [Dibble clearing throat] You were sayin', T.C.? Now that I've got my job back.. Dibble. Uh, make that a large pizza. You'll stay for lunch, of course. [instrumental music] It's not the cost of the gift that counts it's the thought behind it. Knock it off, T.C. I'm on to you. Thanks, Officer Dibble. I didn't know you cared. [music continues] There you are. The richest cat in town. How's about a date? Good timin', Kitty. Let's party. I told you your luck would change, T.C. ...even though you're broke. Broke! thud screech You know I think she's beginning to care. I can't believe it, T.C., you dumped her for me? Hi, guys, I got lonely without you. Amy. Glad to see you, kid. Welcome to our humble abode. We missed you, too. What's going on? A picnic. If we can't finish it off today, you guys can always eat it.. ...tomorrow, tomorrow! That voice is no picnic, but why hold it against it? [instrumental music] [all laughing] Attention, please, chow hounds. Before stuffin' ourselves any further let's pay tribute to the one responsible. Good thinkin', T.C. Uh, three cheers for the turkey. I'm talking about Amy here, turkey! 'Let's put the rap on her right now.'
