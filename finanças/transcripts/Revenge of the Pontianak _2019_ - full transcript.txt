You look dashing today, Nik. Thank you, Ms. Siti. Nik. Why are you calling her that? Siti is part of our family now. Call her Mom. All right? Hey. Come, Nik. Join me and your grandpa. Take him outside. -Khalid. -Reza. -Congratulations. -Thank you. How are you settling in, Siti? It's been great. Everyone here has been lovely. We're family now. Hey. -Who's that? -Rais. -That's Rais. -Khalid. Congratulations. Thank you for being here. You should thank Reza. He invited me. He did? Live in peace That was lovely. May I? Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. It's my pleasure to be here today to celebrate the wedding of my old friend, Khalid, and his wife, Siti. Today is a blessing. A day for new beginnings. And as a gift to the newlyweds, I've arranged something for them. Music. -Shall we duet? -Okay. Sure. Soul vibration Surges through my heart In its arranged tones Its melody and tunes Alas, its humble verses But that's all right Hope it may stir Let it dawn on you, o people -If they should part -If they should part -The tune and melody -The tune and melody -Weakened and soulless it becomes -Weakened and soulless it becomes -Empty -Empty Thank you. I've missed this place. Her name is Ida. Ida. What a beautiful name. -Good thing I made it here tonight. -Right? I'm happy to see you guys again. I mean it. Excuse me, sir. -Thank you. -I wish you a lifetime of happiness. -Hopefully. -Thank you, sir. -Sir. -Here, sir. -Is one enough? -Thank you for inviting us. -Thank you, Lisa. -Thank you for coming. Well, it's time to go. -Already? -Yes. Oh, I see. Is she your new friend? Khalid, Siti, I would like you to meet my new friend... Rais? Rais? Hey. What was I saying? You were introducing us to your new friend. Oh, right. Her name is... -Well, what's your name again? -Goodness. Eyes on the road. Don't worry about that. Of course, eyes on the road. -Hey! -Hey. Come on, what's wrong? Let's have some fun. Are you trying to get us killed? Just watch the road. Don't worry. There are no other cars on the road. Just a little. Rais! Ida? Ida! Ida! Ida! Hey! What are you doing here? Damn it. Rais? Rais? Ready? Honey. Go to him. Nik? What's the matter? I saw a ghost. A ghost? -Where? -Out there. There's no ghost, Nik. But I saw it. There you go. I've scared it away. What if the ghost comes back? If the ghost comes back, here's what I will tell it. "Don't you dare enter this house! If you enter this house, I will use my magic on you." Do you know magic? All the fathers in the world know magic. We use that magic to keep our family safe. -So we're safe from ghosts? -Yes. Ghosts will not come for you. Are you still scared? -No. -No, right? What's the matter? Goodness! My goodness. -Where is it? -There. Darn it. -Hurry. -My goodness! My goodness! My goodness! Darkness has descended upon this village. What on earth is this? Light. With light... comes darkness. Clean your house. Clean your house. Clean your house. Everyone, go back to your homes. Leave this family alone. Whoever committed this horrible crime is still out there. Keep your doors and windows locked, and be safe. Until then, don't leave your homes after dark. -Until the one who did this is caught-- -This... This is not the work of a human. This is not the work of a human. Bring him down. -Go ahead, Din. -Yes. Didn't your magic work, Dad? Right. Be careful. Hey. Honey. Do you regret bringing me to this place? I feel like this is my fault. Don't say that, Siti. Don't ever say that. He died alone. He suffered all alone. Siti. Hey. Siti. We'll meet again in the afterlife no matter what. My love. Let's go. Come. Khalid... Khalid. Honey? Hey. What's the matter? Rais... It's all right. -It was just a bad dream. It's nothing. -Rais... Don't be upset. I'm here. Nik... Nik... Nik... Nik... Thank you, sir. Come, Nik. I told you to clean your house. You've seen it. The darkened darkness. It follows you and everyone close to you. Do you not fear that it will come for your boy? Nik! Where are you going? Nik? Whatever has followed you will come for us. My son is dying! You still have time. That's enough! Cut it out! Clean your house. Cleanse it. Hear my words, villagers. Clean your houses. Offer your prayers. Terrible darkness has descended upon this place. Listen to Su'ut Din. -She's cursed. -Hey, mind your own business! Let's go, Siti. Honey. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Is something wrong? It's nothing. How's my little one doing? Is he behaving? -He is doing great. -Is it true? Have you had lunch? It is near. Come on, Nik. Eat. Want some chicken? Reza, you should eat something. I'm not hungry, Mom. What's the matter, honey? Please eat. I said I'm not hungry. Reza told me there was a commotion at the market earlier today. I'm sorry I wasn't there, Siti. Sometimes, when we're scared, we say things we don't mean. “We”? I mean, everyone does that. At the moment, rumors are rampant among the villagers. About what? About Rais, of course. They don't know what happened. When they don't know what exactly happened, they start to speculate that Rais died because of a supernatural force. That's ridiculous, Dad. You saw his body. You saw the condition his body was in. I must leave. What? You should too, honey. -We should all leave. -Siti. Look, I know you're scared. -And you should be-- -Honey. Something is not right here. -And Su'ut Din said-- -Su'ut Din? Every time that maniac opens his mouth, -all he talks about is-- -Honey. Please. Honey, let's not argue. I just want us to leave this place. It will not be for long. Just for a while. All right. Thank you. How is Siti doing? She's still terrified. Why? People are starting to fear her. They believe Su'ut Din. Su'ut Din senses that Siti has brought along a curse. What are you talking about, Dad? That old man hasn't gone out for months. -Now he comes out and says these things-- -But, they believe Su'ut Din. Where are we going, Dad? I have no idea, Nik. I don't know. Aisha? I don't know what to believe. But I'm scared. Honey. I don't want to lose you. What are you talking about? Lose me? I'm right here. Nothing is going to happen to me. Nothing is going to happen to any of us. Reza! -Goodness! Reza! -Reza! -Honey! -Reza! -Reza! -What's happening? Reza! -What's wrong, Reza? -Honey! -I want to go with you. -No! Stay in the house! -Honey! -Be careful, Aisha. -My goodness! -Reza! -Aisha, be careful! -Honey! -Reza! -Honey! -Reza! -Get Khalid! Mom! -Go! -Mom. Dad. -Dad! -Khalid! -Dad, what's going on? -I don't know. It's Reza. -What happened to Reza? -Reza! Aisha, open the door! -Reza! -Honey, wake up! -Wake up, honey! -Aisha! Open the door! -Honey. -Aisha! -Aisha! -Aisha! -Khalid! -Open the door! -Aisha! -Kick the door! Honey! Aisha! Aisha! -Aisha! -My goodness! Aisha! -Open the door, Aisha! -Aisha! Open the door! -Aisha! -Reza! -Aisha! -Honey! My goodness! -Reza? -My goodness! -Reza? -My goodness! -What happened, Reza? -What happened, Aisha? -Reza? -My goodness! -Dad, what happened here? -Aisha! -Mom, what happened? -I don't know, Khalid. -How could this happen? -I really don't know. Dad... -Dad... -Honey... -Reza. -Calm down, son. -Reza. -I don't know, Khalid. Our child, honey. Sleep Sleep My dear child Aisha! My love Will carry you Sleep Sleep My beloved child Sleep tight Sweet dreams My love for you Will last forever "The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked Your anger or of those who are astray." Our child, honey. Pray that his soul rests in peace. Khalid. Reza, I'm so sorry for your loss. You saw it, didn't you? You saw what happened last night. -You felt it, didn't you? -God bless us. God? God? Whoever did this... or whatever it was that took my child, has nothing to do with God. I could feel its presence here. I could sense its thirst for vengeance. And it wasn't my first time feeling it. We are all going to die. Reza. Reza. Siti? What are you doing? I heard what Reza said just now. What was it all about? What? Vengeance. He said he felt that before. -Siti. -What was he trying to say? Siti. Siti, please don't do this. Siti, please. Don't do this! I can't bear watching anyone else die! I have no idea what is going on now. We must leave this place! -Please! -But this is my home. It's my village. Maybe it is, but it isn't mine. Siti, please. I want you to tell me the truth about Nik's mother. What are you... I've already told you everything. She left us. That's it? -What else do you want me to say? -I want you to tell me the truth! That is the truth! She didn't want to marry me. She didn't love me. She left Nik at my doorstep and vanished. I've already told you all this. -But where did she go? -I don't know! Nik. Why were you laughing just now? It's nothing. Is someone in here with you? -Answer me. -Khalid! -Who is in this room with you? -Enough, Khalid. -Answer me. -Enough, Khalid. Let him go! Khalid, let him go! Come to me, dear. Are you okay? -Yes. -Reza. Khalid! Reza! Reza! Reza! Reza! Reza! Reza! Khalid. I thought it was possible for us to start anew. That if I do enough good, love my family enough, be a good husband and a good father, then we can move on. What are you saying? I think enough is enough. We must pay for what we've done. Like Rais did. Are you hungry? Do you want to eat? I'll make you something. Listen to me. We have done nothing wrong. We have already paid a lot for our sins! Nik. I'm going to leave the door open. Keep it open, okay? I've dedicated my life to this village. To my family. Nothing is going to end for us! Nothing! Those are your words, and they mean nothing. Your words are meaningless. Do you know what isn't now? Darkness. -Reza. -Darkness. Reza. Death. You've been a naughty boy, Khalid. What do you mean? How long has it been? You never told anyone. Reza, what are you talking about? Why have you never told anyone the truth? You even kept it a secret from your poor disgusting wife. Don't worry. We're almost there. Just a little bit further. I never thought it would come down to this. You're the killer. -You're the killer. -Reza! -Why did you come back? -Stop it. Why did you come back? Mina? Siti! Nik! Siti! Nik! Siti! Nik! -Siti! -Honey. -Siti! -Honey. -What's the matter? -Siti. Where's Nik? In his room. Khalid! -Nik! -Honey, what's the matter? Honey! -Nik! -Nik! Khalid... Nik... Khalid, wait! Nik. Nik. Nik. Nik. I need you to tell me about your friend. -We just talk. It's fine, right? -Right. That's right. There's nothing wrong with that. She said she would be my friend because I don't have any friends here. She said that she would keep me safe in case you get angry. She said you will always get angry. Honey. Honey, please tell me what's going on. -Siti, I have no time. -I don't understand what's happening. -Honey, please. -I'm running out of time. -Where are you taking him? -Dad! Dad! Aisha! -Take care of them. -Honey, tell me. -I'll be back. -What's going on? -Honey! -Khalid! -Let me go with you! -You stay here! -Honey! -Siti! Dear, Khalid... Die... Nik... Dear... Khalid... You killed... My child... Khalid, you... Reza, Rais... My dear, Nik... Come in. I knew you would come. The answer eluded me for some time. And now, it has all become clear. The barking dogs. The sick children. And the foul smell. A pontianak has come to our village. You know her, don't you? Yes. Who is she? Mina. I met for the first time nine years ago. I was different then. I was young, reckless and selfish. I would meet her every weekend. Forever. Only you. Forever. But things started getting complicated when she wanted me to dedicate my life to her. But I didn't comply. I had my family's good name to maintain. So I lied to her. I told her that my parents have already arranged my marriage with someone else. She was distraught. She decided to return to her family in Singapore. I will never forget you. But she returned. Yes. Freedom! Freedom! -Freedom! -Freedom! -Freedom! -Freedom! -Freedom! -Freedom! Freedom! She was pregnant. I could see my whole life falling apart. Unless I did something. What did you do? Where are we? Why are we going so far out of town? Khalid. Answer me. Reza? Rais? Rais, stop the car. Rais, stop the car. Rais, I said stop the car. -Khalid. -Rais. Rais, stop the car. Stop the car. Rais, stop! Rais! Mina, I can't do this. I can't be a father to this child. We can't keep this child. There's a doctor who lives here. The house isn't far from here. He's an expert, Mina. Mina... -Let her be, Khalid. -Mina! Khalid, what on earth are we doing? -Khalid. -Mina! -Khalid. -Mina! Mina! Mina! Khalid! Mina! Mina! Try looking over there. Mina! Khalid. -Where is she? -I don't know. Mina! Mina! Khalid. Hey, this is crazy! He's right. -I can't see anything. -Shut up! You two look in that area. I'll go this way. Khalid! Your darn brother! So now it's my fault? Hey, Rais! Mina! Mina! Where are you, Mina? Mina! Mina! Mina. Why is my child quiet? Why isn't he crying? Mina. Khalid! This is all your fault! My baby is dead! He's not breathing, Khalid! -Help! -Mina, please... Mina, I never meant for this to happen. -I'm so sorry. -Cut it out, Khalid! I will tell everyone. -Everyone will know about you -Mina, please. and what you have done. You killed my baby! -You're a murderer! -Mina. Everyone will know about this, Khalid. I'll tell everyone what you've done. Mina, don't. Please don't do that. -Help! -I never meant for this to happen. Look at my child. He isn't breathing! He's dead! -I didn't want this to happen. -Help! -Please don't do this to me. -Help! Everyone will know! -Shut up, Mina! -You're a murderer! -Shut up! -You killed my baby! Shut up, Mina! You're the one who killed him! You're the one who killed him. Why did you come back? Why did you come back? Why? Tell me why you came back! I told you to leave. Why did you come back? Why? Why? Why? Mina? Mina? Khalid. What did you do? Khalid. What have you done, Khalid? No one... must know... about this. We can leave her here. The villagers must not know about this. No one must know. We can go home. We can go home. We can go home. No one will know. No one will. God, please forgive me. Forgive me. I just want to return. -I just want to go home. -Khalid. -No one must know about this. We can-- -Khalid! We have to bury her! My goodness. Dear God, please forgive us. What have you done? There were no proper rituals for the body. How could you be so stupid? Do you not know what you're supposed to do? A woman who dies during childbirth must be buried properly. Otherwise, what's buried will only be her mere body. -Her vengeance will live on. -I didn't know! Did you stab her in the neck with a metal bolt? Well, it doesn't matter anymore. It's too late. Now, she has returned to hunt you. She did not only return to hunt me. Yes, I know. She's got Rais. She also took your brother's unborn child. My son. Your son? Yes. Our son. You damned fool! This wasn't supposed to happen to me. I'm not a killer. I never wanted to hurt anyone. I thought the child was God giving me a chance at redemption. Redemption? I've paid for my sins since then. I raised and loved that boy with all my heart. That boy is the child of a demon! A demon! Please. I'm begging you. Please help me. My family is in danger. I need your help. Please help me. Please help me! Please! Mr. Din. What is this? This is the only way to make sure she stays in her grave. Stab her in the neck with it. Like you should have done all those years ago. Where's your family? We must act fast. -What is this? -Help me! No, let me go! Kill her! Siti! Siti! What's all this? Siti! Enough! Siti! -Siti. -Honey! Help me! Let me go! -Let me go. -It's him. Sir! What is this? I'm sorry, Khalid. I can't control them for much longer. Khalid! Your family has cursed our village, you bastard! What's wrong with my son? My son is unconscious! What's wrong with all of you? Listen to me! Listen to me, everyone! Your fears are justified. All of you are right to believe that this family is to blame for your pain. But this woman is innocent. She's not to blame. She is a victim, just like all of you. Let her go. Let this woman go. -Let her go. -Come here, Siti. Siti. The demon was born from the unholy sins of this man! -Hold on! -Back off! Hold on. It is true. All of it. I did this. And I am sorry. -Khalid, you're not the only-- -I did this! Only me. I am sorry. I am sorry for your pain. Tonight, I confess to my family, to all of you, and to God. Yes. I... I am a liar. I am a murderer. -Banish him from this place! -Get rid of him! Wait! I know I am the reason this demon is here. I know. But I will find this demon tonight and I will destroy it. I will go with him. I will hunt this demon with him. Listen, everyone. Join us if you want. Let us all hunt and destroy this demon tonight! -Let's go! -Let's go! -Let's hunt the demon! -Let's find it! Let's go inside. Honey. Be careful, honey. Siti. Nik. -Nik, get inside. Quick! -Siti. Nik. -Nik, get inside. -Siti, wait. Siti. Siti. Khalid, you go straight ahead. Reza, you follow them. I'll follow those boys on the right. And what about you? I won't be far behind. All right. Let's go. -Come on. -I'll go that way. Be careful, Reza. Wait for me. We'll meet the others there. Did you hear that? Over there! There she is. -Hurry. -There she is. Kill her! My goodness. Don't run. Reza. Reza? Reza! Reza! Reza, wake up. Reza, wake up. How could this happen, Reza? Reza! Reza, wake up. How could this happen? Why, Reza? Reza, please wake up. Reza, please wake up. I told you. I would never forget you. There were times when I felt angry and didn't know myself. I didn't know what to feel. All I could see was darkness. I love you. More than anything else in this world. But you took everything away from me. My heart. You took my life. You robbed me of my dignity. Our child. Our child, my love. He... He... He's willful. Just like... his mother. God, please grant me strength! God will not help you! Quiet! I just wanted you to love me. That's all. Love brought me back to you and to our son. Could you love me again like you did before? Yes, Mina. I can. You liar! I love you, Khalid. Only you. Forever. God protect us. Don't! Nik... Mom. My son. My dear son. Mom... I'm done seeking revenge. I've seen enough terrified people. Cruelty looms large. Take care of my boy. Raise him to be someone different. Someone good. Release me from this life of complete darkness.
