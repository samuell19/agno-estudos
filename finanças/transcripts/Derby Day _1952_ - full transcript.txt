Derby Day has just begun. Dawn is breaking over the Epsom Downs where in a few hours, half a million people will be packed into the stands and enclosures, or jostling one another on the hill. A few lucky ones may even catch a glimpse of the winner. But the race course, that loop of broad, green velvet, smooth and spotless, lies asleep. Nearby, there's already a faint stirring. Some of the runners are at exercise in the grey dorm. The trainer is up early, and takes a final look around. Today, all roads lead to Epsom. Let's select half a dozen from their half million, and find out something about them, and about their visit to the Derby. They get there always. Some by coach, by train, and bus. Some of course, by Rolls Royce. Good morning, Lawson. Good morning, Mister George. Please inform Lady Forbes I'm here, will you? Then it is true, Sir George. What is? Her Ladyship is going to the Derby. Certainly, why not? Well, sir, when they said so, I just couldn't believe my ears. Couldn't you? And why? Well you see sir, everybody's talking. What about? Well, when Colonel Ferguson rang up just now, and Lawson told him where her Ladyship was going, he just said, "God bless my soul", just like that, and rang off again. "God bless my soul". Well, it's no business of ours, Mrs. Wickham, is it? No, sir. But why she wants to do a thing that isn't scarcely decent in the circumstances? Why, even Mr. Singleton, his poor Lordship's valet said he wouldn't dream of going this year. I must say, that's very decent of Singleton. And what's more, Singleton always followed his Lordship's horses while her Ladyship never thought anything about them! Nevertheless Mrs. Wickham, her Ladyship is quite determined. All I can say is it must be the first time that any lady has ever seen fit to go to the Derby in deep mourning. Oh, Mrs. Wickham, I've forgotten my parasol. George. Am I in good time? Helen, I beg you to change your mind. You'll feel most uncomfortable and quite out of place. John? Is she going? Yes, of course she is. Tell Mr. Lawson I knew she would and he nearly gave me the sack. Said I didn't know how a lady behaved. Poor old Singleton, he'll have a fit, he'll never believe it, even if he sees her go. Here's Mr. Lawson! Isn't this a lovely picture? Excellent. "Starry Knight' who will be carrying the colours of Lady Forbes. Well, if we're going my dear, we'd better be on our way. Should I take a few lumps of sugar for Starry Knight? Good heavens, no. They'd suspect you're trying to dope him. Really? I'd better place myself entirely in your professional hands. I think you'd better. Dinner at half past seven, please, Lawson. Very well, my Lady. I shall be dining alone. Very well, my Lady. Even orders dinner as though nothing had happened. So Lady Forbes is going to the Derby, but Jim Molloy who lives here, is not. He has to go to work. He's on the second shift at the Battersea Power Station. Fancy anything for the Derby, Betty? Do you? Well, I'll have a go. Hello... It's that French horse, Mon Gigolo. Want me to put something on it for you? What's happened to you? Come into some money or something? Well, a couple of bob won't break us. Hello, it's not Mon Gigolo, it's Starry Knight. Aye, aye. Egg and sausages? Well, if you brought home a bit more each week, we wouldn't have to have a lodger. Huh, fat lot of use he is. Two weeks behind on his rent. Lost his ration book. Just been unlucky, that's all. He'll pay up all right, when he gets a fight. When? Fifth rate pug who couldn't even lick a sick poodle. Pug, poodle. That's funny, that is. Have you got a day off or something? It's nearly 11 o'clock. Yeah, I better get going. Hey, I'm busy, can't you see? Yeah. Do you think I'm blind? What do you mean by that? What do you think I mean? Oh run along, will you? You're gonna be late. I suppose you're right. So long. So long. What's biting you? We've got to be careful, Tommy. He's gone to work, hasn't he? Yes, he's gone to work. In Fleet Street, David Scott is regarded as the cartoonist of the day. Now at this moment, David Scott has no intention of going to the Derby. At least, that's how it seems. The old man knows perfectly well I can't draw horses. I make them look like kangaroos. Nevertheless, if the old man wants you to go to the Derby, the answer is you go, otherwise there'll be a hell of a row. All right, there'll be one hell of a row. What do you want me to tell the old man? Tell him to go and... All right, all right, I heard. Give me the Editor. David Scott's refused point blank to go to the Derby. I want to go to the Derby. Would you like me to pick up one or two on the road and save yourself a bit of money? No thank you. It'll cost you a fiver, you know. That's all right, I want to be on my own. On your own at the Derby? Cor tummy! You and half a million more. Still deep in his beauty sleep, Gerald Berkeley, one of the bulwarks of the British Film Industry, is going to the Derby. He has no choice, he's got to. He was won in a raffle. Oh, Foster. Sir. I told you a thousand times, a charity matinee at night, and the sun in the morning, it won't do. I'm afraid you'll be late, sir. Mr. Hammond is here. Well, tell him to go away. I'm sick of Mr. Hammond and his publicity. I don't need publicity. That's what you think. Good morning, Garbo. Oh, go away. Foster, how are you off for Asses' milk? I beg your pardon, sir? Never mind. Run the master's bath and put in some Eau de Elstree. I want him to smell nice. I'm not getting up, I feel terrible. Yeah, you look terrible, but you're still getting up. Where were you last night? At the premier of the next Wilcox picture. I didn't get to bed until four. I heard it needed cutting. But you've got to get up. Come on, you've got a date. Where? Epsom. Epsom? More salt, sir? Maybe this will refresh your memory. "An unusual feature of the Boudicea League's" "annual charity bazaar at the Dorchester was a raffle." Remember? It's beginning to come back. Well, don't drink it so fast. "The first prize, a deep freeze valued at 250 pounds, "was won by Lady Gannet. "Mrs. P.G. Harbottle-Smith won the second prize, "a day at the Derby as guest "of Mr. Gerald Berkeley the film star. "The winner of the third prize, a mechanical camel." Did you say second prize? I did. Hammond, you told me I was first prize. What, ahead of a deep freeze worth 250 quid? Who do you think you are, Sir Lawrence? Never mind who I think I am. What are you bellyaching about? I got you billed above a mechanical camel! Thank you. Did you have much of a struggle? If I may interrupt sir, your bath is ready. The things I do for British films. Oh, Foster. Put out my dark glasses. Haven't you got them on? Oh, this Mrs. Harb, this woman who won me, what's she like? Mrs. Harbottle-Smith? Yes. You'll love her. You haven't committed me to that, I hope. Is she young? Ish. - Attractive? - A vision. That's what Joan of Arc had, and look where she ended up. And where do we meet this vision? Everything's fixed. A nice, quiet spot. Hyde Park Corner, I suppose. How did you guess? I've never won a thing in a raffle before. No. Of course I have my premonitions. Yes, and it was my lucky Thursday, and I did see four tabby cats but... I couldn't believe my ears when I read that telegram. Mm! Gerald Berkeley. Don't be silly darling, the film star. Oh! I think he's honking for me now. I'll just go and see, wait a minute. Yes, that's his car outside. Michele! You know something, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, I think I've seen every picture Gerald Berkeley's ever made. The last one I liked so much I think I've seen it 17 times. Ah, you and your dreaming. That's his song playing now. He sings it beautifully. Do you think maybe Madame will take him home tonight and I will see him? Oh, that would be wonderful! Well, if he's the man of intelligence you tell me he is, you mark my words, he'll get rid of that old one quick the minute the Derby is won or lost. Bye darling, isn't it fun? Oh, Michele? Michele! Oh! There you go again, always slipping on that mat. Didn't you hear the bell? The car, go and open the door. What are you staring at? Well, run along and open the door. Mrs. Harbottle-Smith? Yes, she's quite ready. Cook, look. She's very elegant. Furs and diamonds. And real orchids. Do you think would she like the loan of the kitchen stove? It makes me sick to see an old one like that gallivanting off to races with a film star. It's a pity she wouldn't fall and break her neck. Ow! Michele, Michele! Quick, doctor, please! Anybody, my leg's broken! Oh! Oh, you're killed, ma'am. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, you wicked, wicked girl! It was all your fault! The floor polish, polish... Look, telephone for Dr. Faulkner. Quick, quick! And don't do that, put that knife away. All right, Ma'am, all right. Don't touch me. 'Tis no Derby you'll be going to today. Oh, don't talk about the Derby. Stay quiet and I'll get you a drop of brandy. Yes, yes, yes, brandy, oh! Yes, I'll tell her. Thank you, doctor, thank you. The doctor, he comes at once. Oh, Michele, the way we misjudged that poor woman. In the midst of all her agony, the only thing she thought of was giving pleasure to others. Look, you're to go to the Derby with Mr. Gerald Berkeley yourself. Hurry up and put on your prettiest dress. Oh, it's not true. Oh, it is true enough, God forgive me. Then I must go thank Madame. Oh, no. Don't do that at all, oh no. Why? - Well, you can't keep Mr. Gerald Berkeley waiting. Oh, of course not. We can't keep him waiting. Oh! If you'll forgive the impertinence, Madame, but I expected someone with the name of Mrs. Harbottle-Smith to be fair, fat, and forty. Oh, but she is. But she's very kind. Here's my ticket. Now, will you please take me to Mr. Gerald Berkeley, please? I will. I hope he will not be disappointed. When you've been in the British Film Industry as long as Gerald Berkeley, nothing can disappoint you. I suppose you wouldn't like to tell me what's behind this little whim of yours? No, George, I would not. I was Charles's best friend, you know. Yes, I do know. He used to say, "There's one thing about George" "I like above all else," "he never intrudes in other people's affairs." Well, thank you. After that, I'll admire the country for a while. I'm sorry, but please do believe me when I say that I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it and I'm neither mad nor morbid, at least I don't think I am. This is something I don't wish to discuss with anyone, not even with you, George. I'm sorry, Helen. From now on let's enjoy our day at the Derby, shall we? Thank you. You know, Guv'nor, it's a funny thing that I've been driving a taxi now for 35 years and you're the first fare that's ever asked me to take him to the Derby. Matter of fact, I haven't been there myself neither. Well, this is my first visit too. Go on. I thought me and my old missus were the only ones that have never been to the Derby. Whoop! 'Ere, take it easy girl, take it easy. Oi, oi, oi, steady! Half a cockle in it. Of course, my old woman'll see it all right this afternoon. In a way. Television. Ha! But it ain't the same as the real thing, God bless me soul, no. One of these days I'll say to my old Gooseberry, Glad, that's her name, Glad, short for Gladys. Go on. Yes. I'll say Glad, me and you have been working pretty hard for 40 year, and now we're going to the Derby in person. Oi, oi, have a game, have a game! Where do you live? Clapham Common, just over there. Would it be much out of the way to call and pick up your old Gooseberry? Aye? What, are you pulling my leg? No, I mean if she'd like to come. Would she? Ho, ho! But I thought you said you wanted to be alone. Yes, but that was different. Oh, I see. All right then. Off we go! Look at this. Eddie Morgan got 500 quid last night for letting Kid Simpson take him to eight rounds. I could flatten that punk inside one, blindfolded. A couple more fights, and I'll be in the big money. Just wait 'til I'm into that kind of dough, honey. Then we'll go places, eh? Or don't you want to? Of course I do, Tommy. Whatever you say. You are Mr. Gerald Berkeley's chauffeur? Oh not me miss, I've got a good job. I work for the Studio. But mind, I've had to drive yon Berkeley on occasion. I've had to drive them all in my time. All the famous stars? Aye, and some that just think they're famous. That must be very exciting! Well, whilst it's exciting miss, it all depends. Depends on what? Well, who it is I'm driving for one thing, and what sort of part they've got for another. When they've just started a new picture, oh then they're okay. They apologise for keeping you waiting, and nice tips, and treat you just as though you were an equal. But halfway through the picture when they've had one of their best scenes cut, that's a different kettle of fish. By the time they've seen the trade show, they wouldn't even give you a kind look let alone a tip. But Mr. Berkeley, he's so charming. Oh, he's all right, Miss. Just another ham. Now come on, do your stuff, your public's watching. All 30 of them. Hammond, you'll oblige me by going to... All right, I know where. I'm bored stiff with the whole proceedings, I've got a roaring headache, and I'm thirsty. I'm taking care of that too. You can have a whole bottle all to yourself as soon as we get there. I can't wait to get there. Tell me, is Mrs. Harbottle-Smith the sort of woman who carries a hip flask? Not a hope. - Why not? - Not a hip. Hammond, don't ever do that again. Ah, there she is! On behalf of the directors of... Hey, wait a minute, you're not Mrs. Harbottle-Smith. No, I'm not. Hey, Jock, you've brought the wrong one. Please, Madame has hurt her ankle, so I come to the Derby instead. With Mr. Gerald Berkeley. Yeah, but Mademoiselle... Jolivet. Michele Therese Adrienne Jolivet. Yes, but Mademoiselle, there's been a mistake, don't you understand? I understand, there's been no mistake. I have a ticket. Ticket? Ah yes, but it's not transferable. You understand? Not transferable. Who says so? Hammond, if I can be won in a raffle, the ticket is certainly transferable to anyone as charming as this. Mademoiselle, s'il vous plait. Gentlemen! This way, darling. That's it! Mademoiselle! Knock me down with a flying saucer. Okay, Jock, let's go! He's pegged out. Dead? Yeah. Tommy, what are we going to do? I don't know. Give me time, let me think. But it wasn't your fault, it was an accident! We have to call the police and tell them. No, no, no, we can't do that. Why not? We can't, that's why. Gotta get him out of here. I know, the cellar. Tommy! Look, I've gotta have time to work it out, see? We're both in it, so do what I say. Now get outside, keep a lookout, see that nobody comes. I'll get him in. Now go on, quick! Okay? Okay, we're clear. Tommy. Why do you want to go and put him in there for? It was an accident... Get inside! Let's call the police and tell them! Now listen to me. I've been in trouble before, see? Plenty. And I always come up smiling. Do you know why? Because I keep my nerve, that's why. Now if you lose yours now, we're for it. Both of us. Yes, but if we go to the police... We can't go to the police! I'm on the run, I deserted in '45, shot an MP who tried to stop me. Tommy! No, I didn't mean to kill him, of course, but that's why you've got to help me now. What can I do? Oh, let me think it out. When's the next coal arrive? Coal? - Yeah. - Coal? Coal! Oh, coal's next Tuesday. Uh huh, Tuesday, eh? Now, well, we've got plenty of time. I'll be out of here by then, had enough of this country anyway. What about me? You? Well, you want to come? Well, I can't stay here, can 1? No, of course you can't. Don't you want me, Tommy? Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, sure, I want you! We go together, okay? - Okay. - Yeah. Where will we go, Tom? I don't know yet. North Africa wasn't too bad, I don't know why it'll be like now. We want money. You got any? We saved a bit up for the holidays. Yeah, how much? I don't know, I'll go and see. Yeah. Got it, Betty! Betty, look, I got it. It's all set. I know a bloke who'll help us. He's got connections. He'll fix it so as we can get abroad. I'll have to go to Epsom, the races. Yeah, he'll be there today. How'd you know? Oh, I'm sure of it, it's the Derby. He's a tipster, Goggs, that's his front anyway. How much you got? About 16 quid. Uh huh. Now everything's gonna be all right, leave it to me. Aren't I coming with you? No, no, you stay here. Put on a front in case somebody comes. I won't stay here, do you hear me? I won't, not alone! I'll go mad if I do. Oh, Tommy, let's call the police. It was an accident, I can be witness to it! Now, now, now, don't you worry. Do as I tell you, everything will be all right, see? Now you wait here until I come back. Well, Glad. This is a real turn up for the book, eh? I'll tell you when I've been there. I did want to see it on me television. There you go, conservative as usual. You wait 'til you've been there. You won't want to see it on television again. Perhaps I won't. But I wanted to see it on me television today because I've got all me chums coming in. Still, it was very nice of the gentleman to ask me, so I better make the best of it and enjoy meself. Oh, drat this thing! I'll have it taken off. You know, we've met before, Mademoiselle... Jolivet. Oh, Jolivet, yes of course. Oh yes, we certainly have. Now don't tell me, I know, Cannes. But I've never been to Cannes. Oh, what about Deauville? Not Deauville. Then perhaps Monte Carlo. No? Oh, then it must've been Paris. But I've never been to Paris! You, a Frenchwoman, have never been to Paris? You see, I'm not French, I'm French-Canadian. Oh! I come from Three Rivers in Canada. Oh, then you're just over here for the season. No, I work in London. I am maid to Madame Harbottle-Smith. You're what? Oh, you're not disappointed, are you? Disappointed? Oh, no, no, no. I'm delighted. You shall have the time of your life today and so shall I. You know, it's such a long time since I met anyone who wanted to be with me just for myself alone. But don't tell Hammond. Oh no, it'll be our secret, Mr. Berkeley. Gerald, s'il vous plait, Michele. Gerald. Whoa! I wasn't expecting you 'til Tuesday. It's the holidays, I'm taking mine early. Well, we don't want any coal. Well, you gave the order, ma'am, I'm not taking this back. Sorry. Why, if it isn't Tommy Dillon. How are you? You remember me, eh? No, I've never seen you before in my life. But you remember the night you fought Spike Burns. I was in his corner. Were you? I was. It took me 20 minutes to bring him around. I thought you'd killed him. Will you have a smoke? No, no thanks. Well no, tell me. What do you fancy for the Derby? I'm not going to the Derby. What's that? But this is a Derby special, this train. Oh, is it? I've got to go to Epsom to see a man about a fight. Well, little by little. Oil. Got a bite? Er, you oughta change your bait, eh? Oh, Joe, you are awful! What's the trouble? He thinks it's an air lock, but he isn't quite sure. Oh. Well, shall I stop at the first garage and send somebody back? Oh, no thank you. I think we'll be all right, thanks all the same. You know, that's the worst of these cheap cars. They look all right, but you'll never know when they're gonna get you there. Now you take us. We may be slow, but we're sure. Sure, yes. What of? Yes. George, isn't that the taxi that offered to help us? I believe it is. Yes, yes, I recognise the driver. Well, oughtn't we return the compliment? Yes, I think we ought. Robert, pull up by that taxi, will you? Can we help you? I'm afraid we're rather beyond help. You're going to the Derby, aren't you? Well, that was the idea, yes. Well, can we give you a lift? I'm afraid we've had it, Guv'nor. She's seized up. Well, since you're so kind. Oh, that's all right. Hop in front, will you? Oh, just a moment. I've been offered a lift. Well, I hope you get there. Oh, thank you, Guv'nor. You're a toff. Oil. Guv'nor! He's dropped his wallet! Oil. Do you mind if I smoke? I say, do you know how many times I've been to the Derby? Seven. Do you know how many times I've picked the winner? No. Seven. Seven out of seven. Can't have anything much better than that, can you? Every time I go, I think my luck's going to turn, but it hasn't so far. But you never know, pitcher to the well, once too often. Fancy anything? No. I'm backing Mon Gigolo, French horse. You know why? They feed them better in France, no rationing. British horses haven't got a chance. Anyway, that's my opinion. Shall I tell you why? No. And now they're all on their way, that half million. And amongst them, the half dozen that we know. Now for a bet. Whatever the tote pays. Which one on the Derby, which one, seven to one the field. The paper is trying to tell you that it's an open race. First of all, there's 34 runners, and I'm gonna give 'em! Just here I think, my dear. Well, there you are. It's quite a sight, isn't it? Amazing sight. The famous Tattenham Corner is way over there. And there's the winning post. And down there is Tattersells where all the big transactions occur. Oh, so if I want to bet half a crown on Starry Knight, that's where I put it on. Yes, they'd probably drop dead if you did, but you see, they bet in thousands. Just look at those crowds! Wonderful, isn't it? Really wonderful. The Festival of Epsom, there's nothing quite like it. Oh, excuse me, there must be some mistake. I think not, eh, Hammond? Well, I thought the party needed a bit of tone. May I present Colonel and Lady Tremaine. - How do you do? - How do you do? Oh, it's wonderful! Oh look, the carousels. Yes. I love the carousels. You will take me, won't you, Gerard? Of course, Michele. I'll take you on the carousels, the coconut shies, the roundabouts, even the jellied eels. But first of all, I must see a dog about a hare. Excuse me. What kind of dog? St. Bernard. It's the kind that saves the lives of thirsty travellers. Oh, I understand. Now ladies and gentlemen, I'm not a tipster. If that's what you're looking for, there's hundreds of them around here. I'm Captain Goggs, Turf Consultant, a very different thing. When you people are fast asleep in your beds, I'm on the gallops talking to owners and trainers, and you're getting the results for half a crown. Now sir, what about my nap for the day? Thank you very much, sir. Two and sixpence buys my nap for the day, and good luck. Thank you sir, good luck to you. Captain, I want to see you, it's important. I've got to see you, quick. In the beer tent. Two and sixpence buys my nap. Now, ladies and gentlemen, come along! You stand by me, and I'll stand by you. You won't regret spending two and sixpence on my nap, thank you sir. There you are lady, and good luck! What's up, Tommy Boy. Spider. How's tricks, Tommy Boy? Not bad. That's fine. I saw that last fight of yours with Stan Morrison. Oh, that. A crime that decision was. You was robbed. You was terrific, honest. Oh, thanks. Things are very bad with me, Tommy Boy. Very bad. I'm flat, broke to the wide. Could you lend us a couple of quid? I'm cleaned out myself. Well, make it half a quid. A dollar then. Be a pal, Tommy. Didn't I tell you I was cleaned out? Blow. Oh, and I thought we was pals. Didn't you hear me? I said blow, quick. Okay, okay. No need to get lairy. Hello, Tommy. Have a drink? Two beers, Shiela. Best in your house. What's up? I'm in trouble, Captain. Dead trouble. You've gotta help me. I'm always ready to help a friend, you know that, Tommy. If I can, of course. Remember Maxie? Maxie Stein? Here you are, Captain. Oh. Thank you, Captain. Here's to your bright eyes. Good luck, Tommy. What do you mean Maxie Stein? You know what I mean. You got him out of the country, didn't ya? Brazil. Who said so? Never mind who said so. I gotta get out, get out quick. You can fix it for me? Oh, I haven't been in that racket for months, it's dynamite! Well, you've gotta help me. It's curtains for me if you don't. I would like to help you but, wait a minute I might be able to do something. How would you like a little holiday in Spain? Excuse me, your face seems familiar. Familiar? I'm sure I've seen you before somewhere. Well, I should hope so. Wait a minute, you're... No, don't tell me, it's on the tip of my tongue. You don't live in Dulwich, do you? No. I've got it, 1942, Malta. David, David... Of course, Gerry Bowker. Shh, please, please. I don't use my real name now. Oh, I'm sorry. You in trouble or something? Well, I've been in British Films which is much the same thing. Eddie. Yes, sir? One of my many unsung deeds of heroism while winning World War II practically single handed... Was that you, sir? I thought it was Mr. Flynn. Was saving this gentleman's life from drowning. And I return the compliment by buying you a drink. Thanks. Well now, my friend, he runs a little import and export business. Spanish brandy, mostly. Mind you, it isn't quite like the Queen Mary, but you can't afford to be too choosy. Yes, here we are. Can you take two of us? Two of you? There's a girl. Do you have to take her? No, I don't have to, no, but I sort of promised her. How are you fixed? How much will it be? Hm. Around 250 quid. 250? That's right. 100 for you, 150 for the girl. And he won't want to take her even at that price, I'll have to talk him into it. I just haven't got that. Can you find 1007. With all them Spanish senoritas just lying around, why waste money? Yeah. Okay. How long have I got? Boat sails tomorrow. It's cash in advance, you know. Oh, I must have more time. Time and tide, old man. I gotta get back on the job. No, you can't run out on me like this. I made you the offer, didn't I? Get that 100 by tomorrow and take my tip, get out while the going's good. I tell you, I just can't find it! I've only got 16 quid. 16 quid? Are you trying to be funny? I've forgotten you used to be an actor. Used to be? Well, you aren't still at it, are you? I manage to totter to the studios on my crutches. Oh. I thought you'd of settled down years ago. Do you get many parts? Where have you been since peace broke out? Abroad mainly. I take it behind the Iron Curtain. - Cheers. - Cheers. I must enlighten you, old boy. My professional name is Berkeley. Oh. Gerald Berkeley. Oh. There was a fellow called Berkeley in Destroyers, remember him in... Don't you ever go to the pictures? Not if I can help it, no. Well, didn't you see "Nightingales in Knightsbridge"? No. "A Kiss in Kensington"? No, I don't think so. My favourite film is years ago... If you say "Hell's Angels, I shall roar like a lion. "Hell's Angels"? You weren't in that, were you? I should've let you drown. George, is it my imagination, or am I attracting a lot of attention? Oh, it's the dress, I expect. What's wrong with it? There's nothing exactly wrong with it, but it is perhaps a little much for Epsom. You see, it's not a dressy affair like Ascot. Would that account for your look this morning? Quite apart from the disapproval of Lawson and Mrs. Wickham. Come along, I'll take you to the paddock. There's Gerald Berkeley. Good Lord, so it is. Still acting his head off. Do you see who's with him? Helen, darling. You're looking ravishing. How are you, Berkeley? How are you? Tell me, has Starry Knight got a chance? I must find some way of paying my income tax. So we meet again. Yes. Oh, so you two know each other? No, I don't. They very kindly gave me a lift in their car. You seem to make a habit of being picked up. I once gave him a lift out of the sea. Helen, may I introduce David Scott? - How do you do? - How do you do? Sir George Warsham. How do you do? Darling, can you imagine. Here's a newspaper man who's never been to the Derby before. Now I must confess, I haven't. Neither have I. Darling, I'm shattered. Do you realise there are three places where you meet the cream of English society? The Derby, the bankruptcy courts, and the divorce courts. Usually in that order, and almost always the same people. Eh, Berkeley? - Mr. Berkeley, please. - Mr. Berkeley, please. Of course. Excuse me, Helen. Tell me, do you enjoy my pictures in India? - Well, in Pakistan we do. - Well, in Pakistan we do. Pakistan, eh? Yes. I must check up on my fan mail. Ain't it grand? There's the lady that gave our gentlemen a lift. Oh yes, so it is. Give it to her. Oh, I think I'd better take it to the lost properties. He may not call there, it's not worth nothing. How do you know? I had a decko. Oh. Lady. Excuse me, Miss. Yes, what is it? You remember me lady, don't you? You gave my gentleman a lift. Oh, yes. Yes, I remember. Well, when he gave me my fare, he dropped this here. I called out after you, but you never heard, so I thought perhaps you might know how to get it to him. Didn't Gerald Berkeley say his name was Scott? Yes, and a newspaper man. You leave it to me, we'll do our best, and if not, I'll turn it into the police. Thank you, Guv'nor. You managed to get here after all. Yeah, lady. Sailed in like a bird, didn't we, Glad? Yes, on both cylinders. Joe, isn't it wonderful? Yeah. Just like the television. Television, don't make me laugh. Cor lemmy, you're never gonna forget this, my girl. This could be the most wonderful experience you've ever had. It ain't like any other race course, you know. "Cause you can see the whole thing from start to finish. There you are, there's the start over there, see? Then the gun goes, off they go! Round, and round, and round. Then they come round Tattersells Corner, and there's you and me at the winning post, waiting for them! Oh, won't that be nice? Oh, where's Mademoiselle? Oh, Mr. Hammond is showing her around. He would. Did you say your name was Tremaine? It is. Are you in the blues? Well, I was. Yes, I thought we'd met before. Yes, but not in the blues. At Ascot, perhaps. Getting warmer. Does Shepperton mean anything to you? Yes, very early morning calls at the studio. I couldn't agree with you more, Mr. Berkeley. Don't tell me you're in our crazy business! Well, we are on the fringe, so to speak. We were in that big crowd scene when you danced... In the crowd? Well, I hope you're enjoying yourselves here. Oh, yes. It's very nice work and things are very bad. Only two studios working. Our alternative was two days guarantee as Napoleon and Josephine in a quickie. Crowd scene at Madame Tussauds. Well, you couldn't wax very enthusiastic over that, could you? Come, Claude, I think we'll look around the paddock. Yes. Oh, hello, how are you! How are you? Who's that, George? Haven't the faintest idea. Give us a light, mate? Help yourself. Thanks. What's the matter with you? What do you mean? A hangover or something? Oh yeah, sure. Thanks. Hey, hey, Betty! - Tommy. - What are you doing here? I told you Tommy, they found him. What? - Who has? - The coalman. He was going on his holidays, so he brought the coal. Why didn't you stop him, tell him we didn't want any? I couldn't, Tommy, really, I couldn't. All right, all right. Now look, we'll be okay. I've seen my friend, he's gonna fix it for us. He is? Yeah, he'll get us out. - To Spain. - When? Tomorrow night. It was a hell of a lot for it. How much? Hundred quid. Hundred quid? Yeah. You've got anymore stowed away? No, no, I gave you all I had. Well, do you know where we can get any? No, of course I don't. There's only one thing for it then. Goggs gave me a hot tip. I'll get 10 to one on Starry Knight. Starry Knight? Yeah. You heard something too? No. No, no, I haven't. Well, we gotta take a chance on it, that's all. If it comes up, we'll have 150 quid. That's enough to get us out and a bit over too. What if it doesn't win? Well, no need to worry then, we'll have had it. Look, we better break it up. Meet you at the lunch bar, Ruby's. Okay. A very good chance indeed. He's the best horse I've ever had in my stable. Isn't that splendid, George? If you'll excuse me, I'll go and put in the declaration. Oh, Gilpin, would you drop this in at the press room? It belongs to a man called David Scott. His taxi driver picked it up. I'll look after it. Thanks. I'm sure he wouldn't like to lose it. There was a picture of a very attractive girl inside. You mean you opened it? Well, I merely glanced at it. You know, it's a funny thing, I lost something almost identical at Kempton Park. Really? Yes. I had carried it in my breast pocket for over 20 years. Someone you were very fond of? Oh indeed yes, I adored. She was the first two year old I ever owned, and she won 11 races. George. Jim, I'm looking for someone named Scott, do you know him? David Scott? Yes. Is he here? Yes, his taxi driver found this. Well if he's here, I'm sure to see him. Shall I give it to him? Right. But if you don't see him, turn it into the lost property office or the Lady Forbes on the owner's balcony. Thank you, Bill, that was wonderful. Hammond. If you've taken her to the fairground... Oh no, Gerald! We went to see two dogs about two hares. Oh, you did, did you? Mhm. And Hammond, I'll thank you to remember that Michele won me in the raffle and not you. That leaves me with the deep freeze. You said it. Now, darling... What did you say, Gerald? I said now darling, I want to explain to you. You see, there are six races, the Derby's the third. Now, I'm going to have a bet on the first race. Shall I put on something for you? Oh yes, please. Now, Balbous is the favourite. Wait a minute. Yes, he's five to two on. That means that if you put five shillings on him and he wins, you win two shillings. But that's not good. Well, it's better than smack in the belly with a wet fish. Please, I don't understand. Never mind. Now, this Balbous, if he loses, I get nothing? Not a sausage. No sausage? That's not good at all! Well, perhaps you're right. Well, I'm gonna have a fiver on Leprechaun at three to one. This one... Lollipop. Lollipop, wait a minute. Oh, not a hope. 20 to one. But if he wins I make 20 times? If he wins. That's good. But he won't win, he's an outsider. I will bet one pound on him. No, no, I'll do it for you. Oh, but I have lots of money, seven pounds. You've been robbing a bank? That's my savings. Then you hang onto it. No, Gerald, please. Today will never come again. Take it. All right. But you'll lose it. Mm! No, on second thought Hammond, you shall put it on for us, while I show Michele Epsom. Oh, yes. Oh, look. That man going like this. Oh, yes, that's a tic-tac man. Tic-tac man? What is it? You ask too many questions. Excuse me, can you direct me to the owner's balcony please? Are you an owner, sir? No, I'm afraid not, but I'd like to speak to someone there. Well, the owner's balcony is over here sir, but I'm afraid you can't go in, it's for owners only. Well, I wonder if you'd mind telling that lady in white I'd like to speak to her. My name is Scott. Very good, sir. There's a gentleman by the name of Scott to see you. Scott. Oh, I'll see him. No, George. All right, I'll come. But the horses are going down to the post. George, I'd rather not see anything before the Derby. I just wanted to thank you very much for having this returned to me. Oh, I'm glad you got it back. I wouldn't of lost it for anything. We remembered that Gerald Berkeley mentioned you were a journalist. That's funny, because I'm not a journalist. Oh, aren't you? No, I just draw pictures of people, it's my job. How odd. So am I, or rather was. Oh? Are you an artist too? No, I gave up painting a year ago. Do you miss it? Very much. I expect I shall start again soon. Well, I'm afraid I don't know much about painting, I can't even draw properly, I just have a sort of knack of spotting unusual things in people. Well, you should have quite a few, they're here. Oh, this is really rather out of my beat. Oh yes, I remember, you've never been to the Derby before. You have a good memory. They're under starter's orders, they're under starter's orders. Oh, they seem to be starting now, you mustn't miss this, goodbye. I'm afraid I've been keeping you. No, no you haven't. I just as soon be here. Can I stay with you? Yes, if you wish to. Well, shall we sit down? Oh, I knew he would win, I knew he would win! I'm rich, I have 20 pounds! Will you go get it for me? Yes, Bill, you go and get it for her. Oh! Goodbye, Bill. Hello, how are you? Oh, it's so nice to see you again! Who is it, Gerald? I haven't the faintest idea. Oh. May we thank you, Mademoiselle. We backed your tip and won. Let me see. 50 bob each. 50 bob? That's better than a smack in the belly with a wet croissant, yes? Yes, darling, much better. Why don't you want to see anything before the Derby? Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't help overhearing what you said there. Why do you ask? It was just that I feel the same way as you do. I see. Do I ask you why? No. No, please don't. Very well, I won't. Thank you. I'm off to Germany tomorrow. Oh, are you? What to do? Oh, to collect a little humour from the military department for the edification of our countrymen at home. Does it make you very unpopular? No, on the contrary. The more you insult them, the more they seem to like it. Oh. Well, I think perhaps I ought to get back now. Goodbye. I suppose you wouldn't care to join me in a drink. Thank you, I would like that. Oh good, excuse me. There you are, Michele. Your winnings on the second race, a hundred of the best. Oh, merci. I'm a millionaire. Gerald. Colonel. Thanks to you my dear, Lady Tremaine have won a pony! Pony? Will he take it home with him? The Colonel means we won 25 quid. And that's better than a slap on the belly with a wet croissant, n'est pas? Yes, much better. O two, O two. Nine to two field, nine to two field. 15 quid, Starry Knight to win. Starry Knight. 150 pounds, fifteen, O three. 'Ere. I thought you was broke. Be a pal, Tommy Boy, be a pal. Get out of it! Now, Michele, we must play your luck. How about a tip to the Derby? Oh, yes. You must read them to me. All right. Jitterbug, Amasto, Bluebottle, Starry Knight. Starry Knight, I like that. Go on. Mike's Fiddle, Jinjee, Firestone, Prince Charming. Prince Charming! Oh, Gerald. We must do Prince Charming. Yes, Prince Charming, old boy. But he hasn't got much of a chance, Michele. Nor had Lollipop or Johnny. Follow the lady, we're out of our class. Yes, we will win. Has he got big, long odds? Yes, very big, long odds. 40 to one. 40 to one? That's very good. I will bet five pounds on him. All right. I'll put it on for you. No, let Bill. He's so lucky. Wait a minute! You heard. And you can put a fiver on for me too, Hammond. Now, there's an hour wait before the Derby. Let's go on the carousel. Oh, yes! Good bye, Bill. Good bye. Oh. I do think they might've postponed the funeral or something, or at least somebody might've told me her uncle was dead. Well, to tell you the truth, ma'am, we only knew of it ourselves this morning. Oh, it is a terrible bad day for funerals today. You know, I think what I need now is a little soft, soothing music. And I'll switch it on for you now. Thank you. There you are now. And now we're taking you over to Raymond Glendenning who is in the grandstand at Epsom to hear some of his impressions of this year's Derby. Written by W.H. Carr drawn 12, and Mr. Stanley Wotten's Firestone, written by ♪. Robinson and drawn 19. Now those are the runners and the draw, and now as there's quite a while before the races are to be run, let's leave the busy scene in the rings and the enclosures and the paddock where the horses will have to be walked around for quite a while before they come out on parade, and concentrate on some of the people who have come here to spend Derby Day in the traditional manner. Right in the heart of the horseshoe on the Downs with all the fun of the fair. Now, we have a travelling hand microphone out there, and I'm gonna hand you over right away to my colleague Brian Johnston. Well, this is Brian Johnston here, and although this is a bit outside my line of country, I've been asked to come over this side of the course to describe the scene to you, and I must say, it's terrific. We've got the gipsies here, we've got the roundabouts, tipsters. In fact, all the fun of the fair. Oh yes, and one moment, here's someone of very special interest. Excuse me, sir. Look, we're doing a broadcast from here, and I know listeners would love me to introduce you to them, and I know they'd be delighted also to know we have the stalwart, or shall I say the bulwark of British Films here with us. Now, perhaps you'd like to say a few words to your many fans who I know are listening? Listeners, Mr. Gerald Berkeley. Oh, thank you, Brian. I must say, this has taken me completely by surprise. I always make a point of never, never disappointing my public. Now what should we talk about, Brian eh? Well, I expect you've been to a good many Derbys in your day, haven't you? More than I care to remember, yes. Oh, quite. Well now, are you enjoying yourself? Oh, I'm enjoying myself enormously, yes. You know, strange enough Brian, I had no intention of coming to the Derby today. Hadn't you? No, I'm really here in the cause of duty. I was won in a raffle. You were the first prize? Well, I was won in a raffle. Oh, I see. A sort of day out at the Derby with Gerald Berkeley, - that's it, is it? - That's right, yes. And the winner is this charming little French-Canadian lady here, Mademoiselle Michele Therese Adrienne Jolivet. Mm, Cook! May I draw a sketch of you? No, it's not for the paper, nor will it be insulting, I hope. It's for me, may 1? Very well, if you would like to. Thank you. Curious reasons people have for coming to the Derby. Is it the race itself you suppose, or just the occasion? You came on a job, presumably. No, I didn't. No, I came on an impulse, really. Hence the taxi. I came on an impulse too. Why did you come here today? Must I answer that? No, of course not, if you don't want to. My husband who had a horse running in the Derby was killed. Oh, I am sorry. They offered to scratch it, but I wouldn't let them, so it runs today in my name. How long had you been married? A year today. Bad luck. My husband told me on our wedding day that he would celebrate our first anniversary by winning the Derby with Starry Knight, so I came here because of that, and I tried to dress as I imagined he would like to see me. I know exactly how you feel. Do you think I was right? Of course you were. A little much for the Derby perhaps. Yes, yes, so it seems. Well, shall we take Lady Forbes to the paddock? She's with that fellow we drove down, they're in the bar having a drink together. She seems to be opening up to him. Isn't that just what the doctor ordered? Yes. I'd rather she talked with me, but he's better than no one. I've been very worried about her, you know, Gilpin. We all have, Sir George. Yes. I think we'll leave her. I'll come to the paddock and have a word with Telfor myself. You were married to Lord Forbes? Yes. He was killed in a plane accident coming from New York. Three weeks ago. May the 12th. May the 12th. Well, one more of these won't do either of us any harm. What do you say? Thank you. Here we are. My bag! What? It's gone. Oh, darling. Well, when did you have it last? I think maybe in the carousel or the I cannot remember! My money, everything, please, we must look. Yes, yes, of course we will. Excuse me sir, have you lost something? Yes, this lady's handbag in the fairground somewhere. Have you reported the loss? Well, no. We've only just discovered it. Oh, please, yes. I should do it right away if I were you, sir. The police station is down below and round to the right. - Oh, let's. - On the right, yes. Oh, I'm so stupid. No darling, it might happen to anyone. Cup of tea, please. I've had a bit of luck. Yeah? Found a bag with some money in it. Uh huh. How much? Over a hundred quid. What? Over 1007. Yeah. Nice work. Why, if Starry Knight wins, we'll be all right. We'll be all right without it. You said we only needed 100. Oh yeah, sure. Just as well to have a little cushion though. Now look, I'll tell you what we'll do. Split up now. After the race meet me at Harry Bunn's bookie stand. Okay. That's great. You know, Betty, I've got a hunch that everything's gonna be all right. Here is one police message. The body of James Molloy was found today at his home in Wichen Road, Hackney. His wife, Elizabeth Molloy, is missing. The police are anxious to interview her, also Thomas Patrick Dillon, believed to be of the same address, whom they think may be able to help them with their inquiries. If anyone knows the whereabouts of these two persons... That's done it. Tommy, don't let us wait for the Derby, let's go now. No, no, there's thousands of people here today. Couldn't find a better place to hide. Don't hang around me though. That's the one way we will get caught, if we're seen together. Now look, don't forget. Harry Bunn's after the big race. The police are anxious to interview her, also Thomas Patrick Dillon believed to be of the same address whom they think may be able to help them with their inquiries. If anyone knows the whereabouts of these two persons, will they please communicate... Anything else besides money? Yes, my passport and my souvenirs, my keys. Now just a moment, please. - Yes. - Your keys, yes? What else? And my lipstick and my rosary. Yes. Sarge. I've got to see you a minute. Oh, just a minute, Spider, go and sit down. It's important. Tommy Dillon. Excuse me a moment. I know where he is, he's on the course. Get us inside to see the old man. It's Spider, he's got news of Dillon. Show him in. Now you better inquiry at the Lost Property Office. When the racing is finished, come back here if you haven't found it. All right, thank you, Officer. Thank you. Is this one of your usual, Spider? I tell you, I saw him in the beer tent, on my word of honour. On your what? He looked terrible, just like... Never mind what he looked like. Did you speak to him? Of course I did. He wanted to touch me for a quid. And then I saw him put 15 quid on Starry Knight. Who was the bookmaker? Oh, I don't know, but I could spot him. Here's our description. Get it around as quick as you can. I suppose I'll get something for my troubles, Sergeant. Yes. Board and lodging for a few days if you're wasting our time. Come on, Spider. Unless I'm greatly mistaken, you and I came here today with the same reason. Why should we have done? She was killed in the same crash. We were coming to see the Derby together, I had promised to take her. Why, I'm sorry. Tomorrow we were going to get married. And you came here today to fulfil your promise? Yes, I suppose I did. It was the last thing I intended to do, but I suddenly had a feeling I'd like to come here as if nothing had happened. I suppose it sounds damn stupid, but I felt I had to keep my promise to her. I'm afraid I'm being a bore. Oh, on the contrary, you're helping me a great deal. She's very attractive. What was her name? Rosemary. Rosemary. Rosemary Benson. Do you know her? No, but I almost know all the names in that plane by heart. All those who died together with him. It's curious, isn't it? I wonder if he spoke to her, or she to him. I wonder. Nine to two the field, nine to two the field, nine to two the field. Nine to two the field, nine to two the field. This is Harry Bunn. Nine to two the field, nine to two the field, nine to two the field. Do you remember someone backing Starry Knight, had 15 pounds on it? Starry Knight on 15 quid? Check up, will you lad? Do you remember what he looks like? Yeah, let me see. He looked a bit rough, needed a shave. Shut up, Spider. If he wins, hold him up. I'll be over there. Okay. How can anyone be so idiotic, so stupid? Ah, but how can anyone be so charming? What's this all about? Michele's lost her bag. And all that dough? Mm, every penny of it. Just leave this to me. This is right down my alley. Thank you, Bill. Oi. Where's that smile? That's better. You're a tres gentille. You're a tres gentille unto yourself. Yes, I must not be unhappy. Of course. Today's a wonderful day, and Prince Charming will win... Oh, how much do I win? Five to 40? Five to 40, now let me see... That's 200 pounds, isn't it? 200 pounds? Well, that's wonderful then! Why do I worry? Joe, where is it? Where's what? You know, the Derby. Oh, that. Oh, that's the piece du resistance, that is. They keep you waiting for that one. 3:30. Well, where's the place they run it on? Well, I showed when we came in, didn't I? It's over there! Oh, well, I haven't seen it since. Oh, Joe, my feet. What's the matter with them? They're seizing up. Well, you ought to have them decarbonized. Oh, very funny. Oh, Joe, I think I've seen a horse! Where? On the top of a jockey. Oh, no, I haven't. A fag? No, ta. Now look here, Glad. Do me a favour, will you? What is it? Don't mention television, that's all I ask. It's odd how other people's misfortunes help one to see one's own in a different light. Yes, that's very true. Had you known Rosemary long? I first proposed to her when I was 11. She turned me down flat. Well, when did you try again? When I was 12. Any luck then? Well, yes, I think I made a slight impression, I had gave her my catapult. And that turned the scales? Not a bit, she shot at me with it. I didn't see her again until last year. Last year. And I've been married just a year exactly. You'd of come in here with him, and I'd of come in here with Rosemary. It's odd, isn't it? Very odd. Oh, I'm so glad you've made me talk about it, it's helped to break that awful feeling of tension. When you talk about people who are dead, in some strange way you seem to bring them back to life again. For the past three weeks, like you no doubt, I've been bottling up my feelings inside me. It doesn't do any good, does it? No. I seem to have built a wall around my sorrow. And I have to come like a great big bulldozer and break it down. Do you mind? No, I'm glad. I'm very, very grateful to you. Well, now we know. Know what? Copper just told me. The best place to see the Derby is at Tattersells Corner. You can see it go around the bend, right up to the winning post. Come on, Glad. How farts it? Oh, not far, only about a quarter of a mile. That's too far for me. I'm not moving from here. To think that I might've been looking at it... Now, now, now, now. Oh, come on, Glad. Let's make a day of it. Let's go and have a couple of bowls of jellied eels. Now, Joe, you know very well I don't like jellied eels. I'm allergic to them. Well, there's no need to be disgusting about it. All right. Well, I'll go have a bowl full on me own. You know, Michele, in my life, I have no more privacy than a goldfish. Oh, poor Gerald. Way into the night I do my fan mail. Of course, it comes down in the hot weather. My public are very, very exacting. Hey, Gerald. If you only... Excuse me, Michele. In the lost property. Well, what about the money? Not a sausage. All right. Keep her in there and don't say a word about it. Where's Gerald? Well, as a matter of fact he's I know! He went to see another dog about another hare. You're learning fast. We'll probably wake up tomorrow and wonder if we really have met here like this. Seems so long since I even thought about tomorrow. Perhaps that's why we've come here today, perhaps we are a continuation, as it were, of their thoughts and their wishes. Well, we have both of us, in a way, sort of made a gesture to faith. And now it's up to us to straighten ourselves out. What do you say? Yes, we must. I believe it's going to be easier now. And back here from the roof of these stands, we get an overall picture of the scene, and what a scene it is. The broad, bright green ribbon of the track, crisply outlined by the white rails against the stately, sweeping background of the Downs. And then Tattenham Corner, where already the crowds are lining up 30 and 40 deep on either side of the course. The corner that leads into the last punishing half mile stretched out below us to the winning post just on my right. And a lovely touch of colour given by the motor coaches in their reds, and yellows, and blues turned into grandstands for the occasion. And out on the centre there in the heart of the horseshoe, there is the crowd, all the fun of the fair. The bookies, the gipsies, the tipsters, and thousands of human heads gathered together so close, you'd imagine they just made up one giant pincushion. And by contrast, fluttering quietly in the breeze to my right, the royal stand. Indicating that the royal party here are having a day off just like the humblest of their subjects. For although the crowds are lining the enclosures and the rails of the grandstand, so the centre of attraction is still the paddock where the horses are walking round, the jockeys, I saw several of them going out, having been going, chatting to the trainers and the owners. One or two of them getting up already and riding their animals round, ready for the moment when in one long line, they will come out of the gate of the paddock, into our view, on parade on the course. And this is the moment we've all been waiting for, with the runners coming out on parade in the order in which they appear on the race card. So at the head of the procession is Bluebottle. They're all perfectly well behaved despite the tenseness of the occasion. Look at Picasso for instance. Here's Jitterbug, but he's cutting no rug at the moment. Chinese White looks absolutely perfect. Funny name for a black horse, though. Jinjee looks quite unperturbed. And so they parade down towards the silver ring before the massed thousands, all of whom have one particular fancy in the race at least. I wonder what yours is. Now that's why I call living. Jellied eels soaked in vinegar, smothered in pepper. Oh, shut up, Joe. I'm just listening to the wireless. The horses are coming up from the start. Oh, very convenient, I must say. Strange to think that of all... What more can we want? I could tell you. I thought you could. Now, they've all arrived at the post, and the starter's calling the roll. Quite a job with a big field, but they look a very orderly lot today. I wonder what those jockeys are thinking about now. They've got a hard ride ahead of them, and those drawn away on the far side will have to make a really quick getaway if they're to reach any kind of position on the rails. I'll go and fetch her. He's getting them into line. He's drawn number three on this side. Is that good? Well, yes, that means he doesn't have so far to go. And now the white flag's gone up, which means that they're under starter's orders. He's up in his platform, and they should be on their way any moment now. Look. Oh, Prince Charming, I saw him. He is beautiful, I am sure he's going to win! They're coming up beautifully to the tapes. It looks as though they'll be off at the first time of asking. No, no, it's Amasto. She's turned right across two or three horses, and they've all turned round, and they'll have to come in over again. I think he's got them this time. Yes, they're coming up, well in line. And, they're off! I say, he didn't get too well away, did he? No, he didn't, no. What's that in front? That's White Heather in front... And the French horse, isn't it? No, Picasso's second, French horse third. Coming to the top of Tattenham Hill, it's Picasso, Amasto, and Jinjee in front, but there's still a mile to go. Halfway down Tattenham Hill, and it's still Amasto in the lead, Bluebottle's well there, and Starry Knight's moving up fast. Starry Knight's made up a lot of ground, he's lying fifth. Look at him! Yes, he's just back in that bunch, sir. Oh, he's going beautifully. And neck and neck, they race into Tattenham Corner. It's between Bluebottle, Prince Charming, and Starry Knight now. Oh, no! They're coming around the bend now! And now Starry Knight's taken over the lead, but he's still got a long way to go. Come on, Starry Knight! Prince Charming's challenging, but Starry Knight's holding on well, and here's White Heather with a late run! Go! Oh, quick! No! He's done it! Congratulations! And at the post, it was neck and neck. What a finish! It was the nearest thing to a triple dead heat that I've ever seen. What is it? What is it then? 15, 10, one. Starry Knight, White Heather, Prince Charming. Now you must go and lead him in. Well, that was the Derby, that was. And to think that we waited 40 years for this. Come on, let's go and have one. And what a wonderful finish. And now let me give you the result of this year's Derby again. First, Starry Knight, second, White Heather, and third, Prince Charming. And the distances, a shorthead and a head. Five and a half quid. Oi, five pounds ten. Right. 11 pounds 10. Oi, just a minute. 10. 165 quid. 165 quid? Ticket 03. That's him. Not here. What's that? I had a bet. Ticket 03. All right. Tommy! Thomas Dillon? And now, looking down, I can see Lady Forbes leading Starry Knight towards the unsaddling enclosure, and with her is Tom Gilpin, the trainer. He must be feeling very proud to have trained his first Derby winner. And Lady Forbes is getting a tremendous reception from the crowd. In view of the recent tragedy of her husband's death, it must've taken a great deal of courage for her to come here today, and the racegoers are certainly showing their appreciation of it. There she is. Isn't she a pip? She's very beautiful. Yes, very beautiful. I lost my bag, I lost 200 pounds, c'est la vie. But I've had a wonderful day. You may have lost your 200 pounds, but have you seen this before? Oh, my bag! Oh, my money. Well, isn't that just lucky? Oh, duckey, duckey. Oh, duckey, you're wonderful! Now everything is perfect. Yes, everything is perfect, and you're wonderful. Oh! Congratulations. Thank you. I hope we meet again some day. Yes, I do hope so. And now, the crowds are on their way home. Yes, the crowds are on their way home, and amongst them... All right, all right, I haven't got a gun. Hey, Betty. I must warn you that anything you say will be taken down. I know, I know. Well, take this down, will ya? I had 15 quid on Starry Knight on 10 to one, 165 quid. Get yourself a holiday when this is over, Betty. They say Spain's not bad. Don't. Come on, take it. It's your money, it's not mine. Oh, what a wonderful day. Yes, wonderful. I win lots of money, I lose my bag, I find my bag. And when I go home, I buy presents for everybody. For Maroon, a new dress. Very chic. And for Papa, three new pipes. And for Antoinette and Josephine, my sisters, six pairs of nylon. And for Roger, a motorcyclette. Oh, Roger will be so happy. He always wanted a motorcyclette. Roger is your brother, eh? I must meet him. Oh yes, you must meet him. You'll like him very much. He's not pretty like you, but he's very clever. Oh, but he's not my brother, he's my fiance. And oh, I have a wonderful idea. Will you be our best man, Gerald? That would be delightful. I can't wait. Derby to be televised next year. Hey, what's that? Oh, that's a note of interrogation. You know, question mark. Why, what's up? Joe. They never televised it, they wasn't allowed to! They wasn't? No! Well, I'll be! George, are you booked for dinner tonight? I was, but I'll certainly put it off to dine with you. Well, I'd appreciate it if you would. All right. Where would you like to dine? At home. But you told Lawson you were dining alone. Yes, so I did. Poor Lawson and Mrs. Wickham. You think they'll forgive me now that Starry Knight has won? I doubt it. What do you think I ought to do about them? I think we should go straight back to the house, open a bottle, invite them to join us, and drink a health to Starry Knight. Yes, I think Charles would like that. You might even persuade Mr. Singleton, his poor lordship's valet, to join us. George! Would you do that again? Do what? Laugh. It's a long time since we've heard it. I'm sorry, George. I'm afraid I have been very selfish and very full of self pity. Do you know, his fiance was Killed in the same crash as Charles? David Scott? God bless my soul. Do you think it might be a nice thing if we ask him to join the party? Yes, I think it's a very nice thought, if you think you can find him. Have a good day, Guv'nor? Yes, very good. Back the winner? Well, I think so. You think so? Yes, I think so. What odds did you get there? Well, that all depends. All depends? On what, sir? How many people do you suppose were at Epsom this afternoon? Oh, about half a million, sir. What's that go to do with it? Well that makes it 500,000 to one. Once again, the Downs are deserted. All that's left behind is the usual litter, the orange peel, the torn scraps of paper. There'll be racing again at Epsom tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that. But it won't be quite as same as the Derby, nothing is. It won't have quite the same magic, nothing has. Derby Day is over.
