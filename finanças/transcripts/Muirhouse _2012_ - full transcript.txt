All you have to do is type In an EMF, or night vision, Or ectoplasmic reader in Private search engine blast, Everything is right there In front of you. Executive Vice President, for example. Registered Executive Vice President is one of The most important pieces Of equipment that can be. In fact, it really is just It is a digital voice recorder. Executive Vice President is what we call Electronic phoneme phenomenon. This is what happens when You hear a sound But it cannot be determined The source from that. Sounds come out from Fixed on TV Or radios that Not plugged in. Sounds coming out of the walls. Creed verbs kind of Guideline, safety rules, To remind the professionals And hobbyists alike This is no joke. To do business With the unknown, These forces can harm us. We snoop on space, not the opposite. Let ghosts and spirits know best They do not forget. Always be respectful To ghosts and spirits, As they were human, Still on this.

But our goal is to discover and we hope Take pictures that Are closer to Conclusive evidence is possible. Even say For me, do you believe? To some extent. I mean, I think I have Life has a footprint That is left in this world, And I think that If you look closely In which way We can see those fingerprints. You can make It looks positive. Love what good we do is what Makes, well, take Monte Cristo For example. Know all the bad things It happened there, right? It's that kind of fingerprint, Is this what you're looking for ? OK , I mean it could be, Mostly it is about Those intense events That fell into death. they Leave those fingerprints. What The scariest at the moment, Philip, That you ever had In your entire life?
