Once upon a time, there was a witch who lived at the border of our world and the world of the dead. She would abduct children by sending her faithful servants, the Navs, merciless half-birds, half-humans. The Navs lured the children to the witch's den where she devoured their souls. Parents forgot their children as if they had never existed. But one boy with a pure and bright soul managed to defeat the witch and imprison her in the world of the dead. However, the witch didn't give up. She began to look for someone who could help her get back. Someone whose pure soul would become darker than night, who could cross the borders of the worlds. Someone who had already been dead once. Time passed, and the memories of that witch remained only in fairy tales. People call her... Yaga. Egor, why are you so late? Is everything okay? Mom, let's go home. You've grown up so fast, baby. Remember how we used to play together? I'm going to need your help. This is very important. - You'll help me return. - Return from where? Mom... you're... You mean, I'm dead? Egor, you've been screaming. Was it another nightmare? Did they not teach you to knock? What nonsense do you read before bed? - That's why you have nightmares. - Hey, don't touch it! Baby, I don't like moving either. Julia, I'm not a baby. Do you think I don't know what it's like to be a new kid? New school, new friends, new... You should go. Your daughter's up. Come here. Here. Put it up there. Okay. Just so it doesn't catch the eye, okay? Are you hiring a nanny? Uh-huh. - But you didn't want to. - Sometimes you have to concede. We'll keep an eye on the nanny. Why does she need a nanny if she doesn't have a job? You're not mature enough to criticize your mother. Huh? She's not my mother. Sit down and have breakfast. I made it for you. I'll eat at school. What's wrong with him now? Oh, you know, puberty. Don't you think it's been a while? - Aah! - What happened? Ah, it shocked me. What a morning. Great, now it's not working. Alexey, I can't take it anymore. I can't handle it. We've always managed. We'll make it this time too. Eva, what time is my piano lesson today? Your piano teacher will be waiting for you at eight pm. Thank you, Eva. Hey, what are you muttering? Where are you going? He asked you a question. What? Is it beneath you to talk to normal people? By normal you mean yourself? Give me the phone. If you ask politely. Maybe I will. Are you out of your mind, freak? What are you staring at? Give it to me! He's retarded! - Don't be stupid. - Give him the phone. Here you go. I could have handled it. The hell you come from? Ready for some of this, idiot? You're in trouble! Are you gonna piss yourself? Huh? Run home to mommy, sissy. Get up, loser! Leave him alone. Hey, guys, break it up! Let's get outta here. See you soon, freaks. Hey! Wait up. Hi. You didn't have to. Neighbors should help each other out. Wow! Is it really yours? - It is. - Then why didn't you use it? Because you got in the way. Wait! What is your name? Some people call me Dashka. - And others? - Dania! I thought we had an agreement. No boyfriends. - Now go home. - Yes, Mom. I'm Egor, by the way. Dania... She could fall out of the chair. It's not a good idea to put her there on her own. I didn't put her there. Egor, why did you put her there? Have you got nothing better to do? - She was there when I came in. - That's enough. Have you met already? This is our new nanny, Tatyana. She'll be looking after Varya. - And you too, while she's at it. - Mm-hm. Well, I don't need looking after. Egor, don't be rude. He'll get used to me being around. I always find a way to get through to kids. Always. Didn't your mother tell you it's very rude to spy on people? - She's not my mother. - You think you're special? You think you sense things that other people don't? You'll grow out of it. If you ever grow up, that is. Anyone home? - Hello. - Hello. Uh... where's Julia? She's with the little one while I'm cleaning. Uh... - Is everything all right? - Everything's wonderful. I'm sorry, we've never really had a nanny before. There's a first time for everything, Alexey. What's up? How's school? Have you made any new friends? - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh? What's with the face? Huh? I fell down. Fell down? Real men don't fall down. Real men must stand on their feet. It's a clich√©, Dad. Real men must protect those who are dear to them. What about you? Do you protect those who are dear to you? Of course. But a weird nanny in our house seems normal to you? Let me decide what's normal in my own house, okay? Fine! Come back here, we're not finished. Egor! Cut it out! Are you listening to me? When your mother died, I almost lost my mind. But you survived, so stop whining, okay? Egor! Egor! Hey man, give the ball back. Let's go. Ow! I swear I saw her. Let me show you again. Here, look. There's nothing in there. You watch too much basketball before bed. It causes a lot of anxiety. You, on the other hand, have no worries. Stop it! Mom would believe me. Julia, a moment, please? Egor, listen. I'm sick and tired of your drama. I get it, but Mom is dead. It's time to forget her. Forget? Protect those who are dear to you, or forget? It's easier to forget, I guess. As if she's never existed. Fine. If we can't settle this as friends, we'll do it the hard way. The hell is wrong with you? Who's going to pay for the damaged goods? Me? I've been paying for you my whole life. You get money from state. What? They pay me nothing! Nobody needs you. Neither the state nor your mother. I'm the one suffering. Mm-hm. Yeah, right. You suffered a lot... That's for unloading. You haven't earned it yet. Now run to your idiot friends. Don't come home before 10. I'm having visitors. This is my salary... bitch. What are you staring at? We're not in a circus. We have some business to do. According to Wikipedia, Claude Debussy was a French composer, a leading representative of... Did you know that being online for a long time makes you lose touch with the real world? What? - Nice try. - Hold on! Why are you always running somewhere? I'm not running, I'm walking. Why are you serious? If you were a little nicer, maybe you'd have some friends. You'd have some if you learned some better jokes. You'd better run. - Hey! Get over here! Come on! - Hurry! Stop! Come here! There they are! They went that way! Stop! Stop! Guys, help! Wow. What is this place? I don't know. Come in, quick. The forest is no place for kids. If I see you again, I'll tear your head off. Shit yourself? Where'd you go? My mom says he's an artifact hunter. He looks for World War II weapons in the forest. He also killed his wife. It's better not to mess with him. Weapons, huh? What is this? It looks like a furnace. My grandma used to say these were used for burning people... alive. She also said... that after their death, their souls stayed somewhere near. Sometimes they'll quietly call you by your name. But if you turn around, they'll steal your face. Egor. Help me get out of here. Did you hear that? No. Boo! Got you. I'm just kidding. Varya? Varya? - Hey! - I guess it's an echo. Echo! See? There's nothing in there. What is it? We should get home. Dad? Julia? - Maybe your camera's acting up. - Maybe. This has already happened once. She's so tiny. That's weird. Shall I stay and wait here with you? Your piano lesson will begin in 10 minutes. That's okay, I'll be fine. Thank you. Varya's gone missing. Her stuff's is gone. Who's gone where? Sit down and have breakfast. Egor, we still haven't brought all the stuff from the old apartment. Sit. What's the matter? Your daughter has gone missing. She took her. Look. This isn't funny anymore. Sit and calm down. Egor, what are you doing? Here, look! Wow. Right. Egor... What? We have to do something! You guys are idiots! Egor, calm down. You've forgotten her just like you forgot my mom! - Alexey! Alexey, don't! - Come over here. - Let me go! - What are you doing? Leave me alone! Stop! Alexey, what are you doing? - Stay out of it! - Enough already! Stay here and think for a while. If you do this again, I swear, I'll throw you out of this house. [Hey, can we talk? I need your help.] [I'll meet you on the playground in 20 minutes.] [Okay.] Where do you think you're going? - I'll be back soon. - Are you meeting that boy? He's nice. One girl once ran away with a nice boy. He kept on telling her how beautiful she was. But in the end, the girl was left with a daughter and an old piano nobody wanted. Beauty is dangerous. Never trust a man. Mom... Am I paying your teacher for nothing? Get to your exercises. I hope I wasn't too hard on him. You did everything right. Children need to know their place. He's a smart kid. Why would he dream up an imaginary sister? I don't know. Maybe he wants a little sister? Not now, Alexey. Were you serious when you said you would throw him out? Don't worry about it. Okay? Children... should never forget their place. I can't play anymore, I'm tired. Don't let me down. You'll get there eventually. Dania. Mom? If you let him out, you'll seriously regret it. Dasha! Dasha! Dasha, wait! Dasha! What's the matter? Dasha! Wait, please. She'll come back. She'll come back. She'll come back. - Wake up! - She'll come back. She'll come back. She'll come back! Dasha, wake up! Dasha! Dania! Egor? What has happened? - She took Varya... - Who are you talking about? You don't remember her either. You hear that? No. It's so quiet. Hey, moron. You and I aren't done. Just go in and see if anyone's inside. And then I want you to open the door. You hear me? Why do you need the can? You think you're the smartest? Don't touch me. - Hey, get off her! - Stay out of it. Wow. Now what? - You think you're so brave? - Put the knife away. I'll go inside. Guys, you have to see this. Has he been spying on us? Freaking maniac... Eva, call the police. Have you lost your mind? We'll get arrested for breaking into a house. This is our nanny. My piano teacher. Hm. She's hot. Don't worry, it's Micha. Hello. It's you again. I already warned y... I could've handled it. Who is she? Do you know her? The lights. Turn off the lights, kids. Are you deaf? We asked you a question. Answer it. That's my wife. She died after our daughter disappeared. Died? He killed her, bro. Everyone knows that. Has your daughter gone missing? Kids have been disappearing for a while, but nobody remembers them. It seems that even their parents don't need them. Tell us what you know. One day I woke up with a feeling that I had lost something. Something important. But I couldn't remember what it was. There was a single candle burning. And whenever I looked at it, I somehow recalled this old dream that I had almost forgotten. A dream about my baby. Electricity. That's how I knew that evil had come to the city. Every time a child disappeared, there had been power cut in the area. I began following the kids and taking pictures of them. If a kid suddenly disappeared from a photo, it meant everyone had forgotten them. That's how I could track how many children were missing. I've been trying to find my daughter for many years. But I haven't succeeded. I moved here, to the forest. But I haven't found anything here except red threads. Wow. But who would want children to be forgotten? Who's taking them away? Someone they trust. Someone who can easily enter their houses. Are you saying that your wife comes and takes children to the forest? That's not her. Eva, did you get that? Woman. Steal. Children. Forest. Your description matches a Slavic demon who lives on the border between the living and the dead. Baba Yaga. Eva, are you serious? I wouldn't joke about this. What about this place? Have you been there? Many times. It's an abandoned power station. You won't find anything there. It doesn't work. Believe me, it does. We should have untied him. We'll do it on the way back. Hey! Do you really believe him? The guy's crazy, but you seem sane. What do you want? I'm going to get my sister back. Do you understand? We don't need you at all. You can go if you want. I don't need you either. Okay, let's go. Are you coming? You'll forget everything. Where did these ropes come from? They lead to the hut. - Wow, that's huge. - Shhh! Hey, chill. It looks so old. I'll be quick. Be careful. Don't get electrocuted, dumbass. Hey, guys, I found something weird in here! Egor! - Don't go in there. - Coward! I haven't seen you in a while. I've been busy You miss me? I don't want you to leave ever again. How could you let him go? When the boy comes back... I'll kill him. And I'll be always with you. Are you okay? What happened? 1 actually don't know. 1 blacked out. Me too. Get up. Hey! I thought you came here to look for your sister. Is there actually a sister? Cut it out, Anton. Maybe there really isn't a sister. Are you jealous? Why did you take her to the forest? Did you want some privacy? It's none of your business. I didn't drag either of you here. But you asked us to follow you. You know what? I'm sick of you both. Dasha! Dasha! Dasha! Wait! No sister, no girlfriend, huh? Screw you! You're really mental. Varya. Mom! Are you at home? Mom? Dad, are you at home? Hey! Julia, look. Julia! Julia! When the boy... Alexey, what's wrong? Eva, please talk to me. Good evening! How are you? I'm lonely, hurt and scared. Your request "I'm scared" matches "death," "fear," "horror"... - "death," "fear"... - Eva, what's going on? ..."'fear", "horror"... - "death," "fear"... - Eva? ..."dying of loneliness". - Dasha? - What's happening? We're not at home. It's not our world. I know where my sister is. Nobody needs you. They will forget you. Last time, I saw something in here. Here. Who are you? You have a very distinct smell. - And who are you? - Shh! Hush, baby. Don't cry! Varya. My sister. - She's so tiny. - Hello. She cried so loudly in the witch's den. What witch? Is it her? The witch? Nobody's ever seen the witch. She can't leave her den. There are scary invisible birds who bring children to her. Who are they? They're called the Navs. They're the ones who help the witch. They can sense the smell of memories just like predators sense blood. It's important to hold on to your brightest memory. We remain alive as long as we're remembered. Once we're forgotten, we disappear. What? Look at me. You're being forgotten. We should get back to the furnace. Don't do it. You can't go out. If you go out at night the Navs wills catch you. Hide! Don't leave the shelter. The cloak will hide your smell. Hush, Varya. Hey, where are you going? Hey! Help! Shh, quiet. Don't scream. Hey, bro. Stay still. She's waking up. We've gotta get home. Take the blanket. What for? So they don't sense our smell. Egor! Shh. Stop. Help me return. What is it? There's nobody there. Mom? Shh! Boy. The more you struggle, the tighter they're going to wrap around you. We can escape while the witch isn't hungry. There's nobody there. Let's go! Mom is calling. Mom! Mom! - Egor! Wait! Stop! - Mom! Egor? Varya. This isn't your first time here, is it? I've escaped from here many times. While the witch is eating, the others can break away. - Are you okay? - Don't ask. We've got to get to the furnace. There's no passage there, I've tried it many times. We should go back to my house. Wait! Please, come with us. Your dad... is waiting for you. We can make it. Guys, we have to go. I told you, there's no way back. No. There must be a way out. That's impossible. Unless you... already died once. You're the one the witch is looking for. The candle went out. He forgot me. Let's go! Hurry! Please, hold on to your brightest memory. This thing will come back. What are we gonna do? Listen, we'll come up with something, okay? Dad? Julia? Who are you? What are you doing here? You don't belong here. Get the hell out of my house! Out! Mom! Was that you who broke my window? I saw your daughter. What daughter? If I see you again... Get out! Who are you, little boy? How did you get in here? Why are you crying? I think I know you. And one more thing, but it's a secret. Every night I have this dream about a little crying girl. And then I wake up. Am I crazy? You can hear her? Julia, this is very serious. If you remember her, it means she's still alive. Her name is Varya. Remember? My little Varya. Julia, I have to go. Please, please, think of Varya. Varya... Real men must protect those who are dear to them. Dad! Please, stop. It's me. Let him go! Run, Egor, I can handle him. Alexey, remember, this is your son! I don't understand what's going on. Everyone's forgotten us. So what? You're forgotten, but I haven't been noticed my whole life. I don't see any difference. You're being a wimp. I'm sure your sister's still alive. We'll come back for her and destroy the furnace, so then kids won't disappear anymore. We need to figure out how to kill Baba Yaga. What about the good, old fashioned way? We'll burn the witch! I'll teach you to break into my property. Remember your daughter. We need your help. You must remember. Have you seen her? Have you seen my daughter? Yes. There's a passage in the furnace. But she's gone. I'm sorry. She didn't make it. I would feel it if she died. It's true, she's gone. I saw it. She's alive! Where's the passage? Let's go. Stay here. If I don't come back, burn everything down. We'll all go. Together. Sweetheart. Come to me. Sweetheart. Egor, what took you so long? It can't be true. You're not real. Sweetie, you're so special. You can cross the borders of the worlds. Now I know it. We can leave this place together. No. Your friends have forgotten you. Your father, too. But I love you. Get rid of the girl. Give her life to me, so we can be together again. I don't want to. You're not my mother. My mother is dead! What's happening? Tanya, remember me! Our daughter, Tanya! We can save her. She promised to bring her back... if I brought her the boy. Help me return to your world. Or die. He has parents who love him too. Like you loved our daughter. Don't you remember? He has parents too. Real men must protect those who are dear to them. No one will remember you. No. We remember each other. - Hey! Over here! - Come get us! You're the one they'll forget! Alexey, look. Wait, give it to me. That's enough, put it back. - Oh, come on. - Right, enough. Guys, stop it. Let's take a photo. Aren't you afraid your friend will come out? I have you by my side. Would you like to join us? One, two, three. What's wrong? She can never be killed. She'll always come back. Shhh!
