Precision, timing, not a moment out of place. Because even though Andrés and I might not have spoken the same language, when it came to music, we became so in sync that, well, we finished each other's musical phrases. Ooh! Good show as usual, Vivo. Are you hungry? Do you want a croqueta? Maybe mangoes? Ooh! Somebody likes mangoes. You might look at us and think, "Those guys got a perfect life." And you'd be right. That is... until the letter came. ¡Oiga! Señor Andrés. Okay. Hoo. You... ...have a letter. Muchas gracias, Montoya. Hmm... Marta? But how? Marta? Who's Marta? "Mi amor, Andrés..." "Mi amor"? Who's Marta? "What words can I write in a letter after being separated for so many years?" "As I prepare for retirement, I have been flooded with memories of the beautiful music we once made together." "I don't know if you can forgive my silence since we separated all those years ago." "But nothing would mean more to me than for us to sing together again." "My farewell concert is June 16th at the Mambo Cabana in Miami." "If you are there with your tres, I'll know you feel the same." "I hope it's not too late. Amor, Marta." I can't believe it. Marta Sandoval! - Did you say Marta Sandoval? - Marta's final show? - Hold up, hold up, hold up. Who's Marta? - You're going to Miami? No, no, no, no. We go from the apartment to the plaza. That's our commute, two blocks. You have to go, Andrés. You can finally perform in Miami together. What? No! This is where our audience is. - I cannot go to Miami. I'm an old man. - Yeah, great point. Know your limits. Come on, everyone. Chip in. ¡Suelta el billete! Andrés y Marta. Qué romántico. Uh, let's not get carried away. Who's Marta? Hello? Hey! Who is Marta? Mmm. Ay... Oh. Wait. This is you? I assumed you were always an old man. So you guys were like a duo? Marta, ay. She was the toast of Havana. She had the most beautiful voice in all Cuba. And, uh, she was also the love of my life. But I never told her how I felt. Everybody knew that she would be a big star someday. ♪ Mi canción ♪ One night, after another sold-out show, I knew that this was my moment. I had finally found the courage to tell her how I felt. But just then, we were interrupted by a promoter from the United States. He offered Marta a chance to perform at the Mambo Cabana in Miami. Marta was floating on air. Her dream was finally coming true. And, uh, at that moment, I realized that if I told her what was in my heart, she might not follow her heart. So, I kept my feelings to myself and said nothing. Without her, Havana was empty. I was too. All my love, all my sadness, I put it into a song. It was a song too painful to play. A song Marta would never hear. Here it is, Vivo. The last song I ever wrote. Wow. She never got to hear it. That's so sad. But now, my friend, I have the greatest gift in the world. A second chance! Second what now? - We are going to the Mambo Cabana! - The Mambo the what what? ♪ There is a place ♪ ♪ Many miles away Where the rhythm digs in deep ♪ ♪ And won't let go, that's how you know ♪ ♪ You've reached the Mambo Cabana ♪ ♪ Your heart will race ♪ ♪ Horns will start to play And banish any hope of sleep ♪ ♪ This is my chance To share another dance ♪ ♪ In the Mambo Cabana ♪ ♪ Mambo Cabana, Cabana, Cabana ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Everything will be okay. Catch! Hey! Listen, Vivo. I must deliver this song to Marta. She needs to know that I love her. It's only one song. I need you, my son! Hey, Vivo, where are you going? Mmm... Ay, Vivo. What is he thinking? A plane trip to Miami. It's been 60 years, and you go all the way there for one show? For one song? What difference can one song make? What am I doing? Come on, Vivo. That suitcase isn't gonna pack itself. Okay. Beautiful day to travel. Good morning. Look, I'm really sorry about last night. But I think we... Andrés? Oof! Havana lost a good friend in Andrés Hernández. For years, the sound of his tres filled this plaza and our hearts. We were all so excited for news that he would soon be reunited with Marta Sandoval. But alas, it was not meant to be. Ay, señora. Ay, muchas gracias. My name is Rosa Hernández. Andrés was my late husband's uncle. My daughter Gabriela and I are from Florida. This is our first trip to Cuba. Psst. Hey. That's my mom. My name is Gabi. You're Vivo, right? Hey, I know what you're going through. I lost my dad too. Carlos's connection to Cuba was a bond that neither time nor distance could ever break. Unbreakable bonds. That's what we got. Family takes care of family, right? See, you get it. Wait! I got a great idea. You should come live with me in Florida. Yeah, we're going home tomorrow. Come on, get in the bag. Wait, wait, Vivo. Where are you going? Are you worried about where you'll be going to the bathroom? It's okay. I got wipes in here. So I thank you so much for receiving Gabriela and I with open arms. Gracias, señora. Ahora, amigos, let's all take this moment to say our goodbyes as we listen to one more song for Andrés Hernández. ♪ You spent your life making music ♪ ♪ I thought the songs would never end ♪ ♪ Now it's so quiet ♪ ♪ All I wanna do Is play again with you, my friend ♪ ♪ You fell asleep humming music ♪ ♪ The sun came up, you stayed at rest ♪ ♪ Now here I am ♪ ♪ All I have left is one request ♪ ♪ One more song, just one more ♪ ♪ Give us an encore, don't go away ♪ ♪ We still have music to play ♪ ♪ Hey!

It's the weird kid. Gabi, what are you doing? Just playing a tune. Maybe Vivo will hear it, and I can take him back to Florida. Oh, that's right. She's from Florida. Gabriela, what did I say? No more pets. - Please? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. And besides, we cannot take a wild animal on a plane. Ugh. Señora Hernández! So glad I caught you before you left. Gabi, mi niña, we know you love music, just like your Uncle Andrés. So, we wanted to see you off with a few of his musical mementos. Vintage maracas! Claves! Ho ho! Check out this bad boy! Oh, thank you, Montoya. You gave my kid an accordion. You feeling it, Mom? Ah, what a beautiful thing. Music is in her blood. - Cuba! Cuba! I love Cuban music. - Oh! That's it. Marta, here I come. What's up, Cuba? I'll give you a backbeat. Thank you. Thank you, Gabi. I'm sure all of Cuba knows you're here. Sorry. Guess my playing was a little too hardcore. Playing? That noise was playing? Ah, bueno. Here's your taxi. Montoya, thank you. ¡Gracias, Montoya! Adiós. Practice that music every day. Ugh, my head. I guess traveling is not my thing. Where am I? What time is it? What time is it? What time is it? Okay, 10 a.m. Still have ten hours. Oh, right. It's the backpack kid. Look what I got. Hmm? Hmm? - Are you excited about today? - Oh, yeah, of course. What's today? It's your first cookie sale with the Sand Dollar Troop. Woot woot! Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen. I've taken the Sand Dollars about as far as I can. Gabi, what are you talking about? You've only been to one meeting. I know. - But it's time to move on. - Move on? You just started with the troop. You're still getting to know them. Ha! Tail never fails. Please, give them a chance. Look, I made my resignation video. Cookies! Peace. We out. Bye. - Creative. - Wait, wait, wait! This is the best part. I turned them into zombie clowns. Buy my cookies. Gabriela Maria Rosa Hernández, you are a part of that troop. They're counting on you. You can't just abandon them. Why? Pulgita, you can't keep pushing everyone away. If you don't at least try to get along with other kids, you're going to be very lonely. Meh. Gabriela, escúchame. You're doing this! I let you keep that... that... that... that purple hair. You owe me one! But, Mom, all they ever talk about are selling cookies, getting badges, saving the Everglades. It's so boring! You're going to the cookie sale. You're going to take selfies. And you're going to have fun and bond! Now put on the uniform. It's really cute. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Coast is clear. Let's get out of here. Ow! Ow! Whoa! Ow! Ow! Ow! It's fine. It's just the belongings of your dearly departed great uncle. Rolling on the floor, all by itself. Playing spooky accordion music. It's fine. - Vivo, you're here! - Yup. And now I'm leaving. You followed me, didn't you? And you snuck in my bag because you love me! I'm so glad you're here, Vivo. Now I have someone to share my friendship bracelet with. Best friends forever! - Hey, let go. Paws to yourself. - Hold still. - Forever's a long time, kid! - I have a song to deliver. Nice meeting you. Peace! Are those little gravestones? Oh, that's my petting zoo. Well, it was. Gabi? It's my Mom. Hide. 'Sup, Mom? Why did I just find this in the microwave? I was drying it? You were dr... What is that? How many times have I told you? No food in the room. We're going to attract animals. Here, take your uniform. You mean my invisibility cloak? - Gabi. - I can feel hives coming on. My throat is getting itchy. It's a uniform, not an allergy. Here. Hurry up and change. We don't wanna be late for the cookie sale. Yes, I do. Did you see that, Vivo? She doesn't get me at all. She wants me to wear a uniform just like everyone else.

No! Get away! - There you are! - No, no, no, no, no! I know why you came to Florida. You're trying to find Marta. I read Marta's letter. Tío Andrés wanted to be at her show tonight, didn't he? Are you trying to get there too? But... but why? What's this? "Para Marta"? Tío wrote her a song? "Your plane leaves in the morning. Soon the world will see you shine." "And I wish I could go with you, but your journey isn't mine." You know what this means? He never got to say, "I love you." Vivo, this is really important. Marta needs to hear this song. And I'm gonna get you there. You are? Marta's final show is at the Mambo Cabana in Miami. We don't have much time. But don't worry. I have a plan. First, get in my bag. Ugh! Anything for Andrés. Anything for Andrés. Anything for Andrés. But it's Marta Sandoval's last show ever! - Come on, Mom, - What? Miami isn't that far. Since when are you such a Marta Sandoval fan? Since I was born. I'm a huge fan. Name one song. Uh, "Despacito"? Get ready for the cookie sale. I'm not going to tell you again. Don't worry, I have another better idea. Does it involve cleaning your backpack? 'Cause there's a lot of stuff in there. Wipes are none of them. I saw no wipes. Let's see. Key West to Miami. Perfect. This will get us there in time for the show.

I can't tell you how proud we are that you chose the Mambo Cabana for your final show. Marta. Is it true that your old partner Andrés might play with you tonight? One can hope. Welcome to beautiful downtown Key West. Step one, bus tickets. Now, remember, stay in my bag, and if anyone asks, you're my emotional support animal. Cookies! Cookie sale. All proceeds go to protecting endangered species. Oh no, the Sand Dollars. Oh, Mr. Henshaw. Can I interest you in some Manatee Minties? Did you know the Everglades are home to 2,000 species of plants and animals? And 70 of those are endanger... Oh, excuse me. You know that if you buy a Sand Dollars cloth bag instead of using a plastic one, then you won't have the blood of Mother Nature on your hands. I'm not a bad man. I just want a cookie. We gotta get out of here before they see us. Hernández! Oh, hello, blonde one. Other girls. Gabi, where's your uniform? Yes, we have rules, Hernández. Only a Sand Dollar in full uniform may participate in a cookie sale. What? The cookie sale is today? I totally thought that was yesterday. But you didn't show up yesterday either, did ya? That's a good point. I was busy rescuing this animal. Aw! - What are you doing? - Oh, he's so cute. Can I pet him? - No. - Go to town. He loves it. - Look at that face. - Aw! - He's adorable. - Hey! Stop. This is borderline abuse. - His little ears! Oh! - So fuzzy. What's his name? His name's Vivo. And he's a possum. Gabi, that's not a possum. That's a kinkajou. A very rare South American tropical rain forest mammal, aka the honey bear. The honey bear? Never heard it, but I'll take it. His eyes look a little cloudy. His coat is kinda mangy. Has he seen a veterinarian? Uh, sorry, what? Gabi, there are rules to be followed. For his own safety, he needs vaccinations and a week of medical observation. A week? Yes. Isolated from other animals. Didn't you read your Sand Dollars manual? Oh, yeah, the week. We did that. Oh, good. Then you wouldn't mind showing me his vaccination certificate? Yeah, I'll get it right now. It's in the trunk of my bike. No, no, no, no. - Uh-oh. - Time for plan B. Wait a minute. Bikes don't have a trunk, right? You know, I'm starting to think she doesn't have a certificate. Yeah, you think? Girls, we've got us a Sand Dollar gone rogue. Move out! Change of plans. We'll catch the bus at the next stop. - Pull over, Hernández! - Oh no. Surrender the kinkajou! Don't worry, Vivo. I'll lose them. But what about the bus? The plan was the bus. Well, that didn't work. Come on, Vivo. Get back there and shake 'em off. Ha! Take that. How fun is this? And this should not be in a child's backpack, but here you go! Hey! Oh, no, you didn't. Oh, there's the wipes. Ha! Stop! You stop right there, you little... Ah! Huh. Haha! Take that. He's dousing himself with chemicals! It's a cry for help. Gabi, give us the kinkajou! Ah! Mr. Henshaw! You drove here? You live two blocks away! Shame on you! Shame. You're in over your head, Hernández. Give him up! Vivo, hold on tight. - We're gonna jump it! - What? Yeah! Woo-hoo! All right, Miami, here we come. - Ah! - No, no, no, no, no, no! Huh. What have we done? We've allowed that poor, defenseless creature to roam free in a world where he surely won't survive. - So, back to the cookie booth? - Cookie booth? Uh, no! It's our duty as Sand Dollars to rescue him. Eva! Yeah? We're gonna need your dad's boat. The song. Where is it? Where is it? Where is... where is... where is... Ah. Still in one piece. Okay, where are we? Where is that bus? No! Whee! Sand angels! Vivo, you should really try this. Look at me. I'm a cat. Meow, meow. Ugh. I gotta get off this boat. Hey, Vivo. I know we missed the bus, but don't worry, I have a plan C. If we take a shortcut through the Everglades National Park, we can make it before the show. Okay. New plan. Let's see. Hmm. Ha! Ha! Whoa, Vivo, we're so in sync. Just like a mind meld. Oh man. I thought it could hold it. Mind meld? If we had a mind meld, you'd be panicking, because that was our ticket to Miami. Now we're stuck on this giant boat headed in the wrong direction. We couldn't be more out of sync. This is what "in sync" sounds like. This is you and me. We have totally different definitions of the word "plan." To me and other rational people, a plan revolves around the Five P's. Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance. But you, your plans are just bad impulses. What are you doing? Ta-da! Sometimes you gotta improvise. Yeah, that will never float. And the journey begins now! It floats. It actually floats. - Oh! - Heads up. Give me a sec. Don't want to pull a hammy. Okay. Ready, Vivo? Woo-hoo! And she missed. I missed the boat completely. Did you see that, Vivo? Hysterical.

I'm sure you have a lot to live for. It's not like that. Actually, I'm taking a literal nap. Yeah, I'm just hibernating until the end of my life. I mean, the end of dating season. Dating.

"One dating season, you're gonna find the girl of your dreams, and love's gonna pick you up." That's great. But I got a thing. Huh? ♪ Love's gonna pick you up And never put you down ♪ - Yeah. We all know the tune. - Wanna cool it with all that love? Um, so, I'm kind of in a bit of a time crunch. I've been here for eight, count them, eight straight seasons, and instead of love picking me up, it's just dumped me in a ditch. Tragic. Anyway... I'm an invisible spoonbill. No one cares I'm alive. Especially Valentina. - Valentina's looking at me, isn't she? - Yeah. Nobody knows I know you. You don't know me. - Good luck finding your friend. Bye! - Ah! Wait. Get out of there. - Have you tried telling her how you feel? - No! I can't tell her. I'm scared. No, I've heard this song before. It doesn't end well. Come on, I'll coach you through it. Then you'll help me find my friend. Deal? Okay, deal. Now, introduce yourself. Hi, you're Dancarino. I mean, I'm... I'm Dancarino. Hmm. Enchanted. - No. Back to my hole. - No, no, no. Hey, hey, focus. Smile and compliment her. - Uh, Valentina. - You got this. Your eyes are like two huge pools... No, they're like two big bayous in your face. Bayous? In my face? Oh no. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said about my... Got a frog in my throat. Sorry, Gary. - Oh, they're perfect for each other. - Oh, Dancarino. You have such handsome plumage. - It's nice for my eye... - uh, bayous...to look at. 'Cause they're actually my eyes. This is going strangely well. Now, take her hand. - Ow! - Oh, sorry. Oh! - I'm so sorry. - No, no, no, it's fine. I have another eye. It's totally great. - Ow! - Oh! Easy with the beak. Not too quick, Dan. Uh, yeah. Go in at an angle. To the left. Yes. That's it. Now, fly away together. ♪ Love's gonna pick you up And never put you down ♪ Perfect. What? Wait, you were supposed to help me. Come back! We had a deal. We had a deal! Okay, vamos. Heads up, everyone. Showtime's in four hours. We need to get the lighting cues down for the finale. Excuse me, mi niña. Any word from Andrés? Not yet, señora. I'll double-check right away. Thank you. Where are you, my friend? Vivo? Vivo? Where are you? Oh no, where is it? Where is it? Where's the song? Come on. Vivo's gonna kill me. Oh. Whoa! Ooh. It's just a turtle. It's not just a turtle. Becky? It's a Florida red-bellied cooter. It belongs here. It's native to these parts. Unlike your friend. Where is he? Um, he's kinda missing. You lost a kinkajou in the Everglades? Well, congratulations, Hernández. You've killed him. Wait, what? A kinkajou cannot survive in this environment. His natural predator is every animal in here. He needs to be quarantined. And you are gonna help us find him. Heh. I'm not helping you. Then I guess you don't want this. You were looking for this song, weren't you? No, I don't care about that song. Fine. Then we should recycle it. Eva? Huh? Eat it. Yeah, all right. Wait! Fine, you win. I'll wear the uniform. I'll sell cookies. I will do whatever you want. Just give me the song back. You get the song when the kinkajou is safely in our custody. Gabi! Where are you, Gabi? Disgusting! Who am I kidding? I'm not cut out for this. I'll be lucky to get out of this swamp alive. - Gabi! - Shh. Did you just shush me? Buddy, be quiet. Seriously? Do you have any idea what I've bee... Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup. Are you bup-bup-bup-bup- bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-ing me? That's it. You want me to be quiet? I'm being quiet! Yeah. I thought so. Walk away, buddy. We're in the middle of a swamp. Who cares about a little noise? Me. Mmm, what a lovely voice you have. Never seen you around these parts. My name's Lutador. You got a name? It's Vivo. Oh! My goodness, I hate that name. Your new name is Noisy. Noisy the Singing Rat. Yeah. I'm not a rat. What... what are you? A gibbon? I'm a kinkajou. Mmm. Sounds exotic. Hoo. Well, you listen right here, little kinkajou. I hate noise. So you must be quiet. That's my rule, man. And everyone around these parts understands it. Don't y'all? Mmm. That's what I like to hear. Absolutely nothing. Uh, I'm sorry. I promise, you won't hear a peep from me. You want quiet? I can do quiet. I'll be quiet. I know very well you're gonna be quiet. Deathly silent, in fact. All my meals are. Whoa! Ho ho ho ho! Would you look at that? Oh, my friend... ...you're about to run out of tree. Huh? Oh, thank goodness. I'm saved. Are you an angel? Vivo, it's me! Dancarino? You saved me?

They have the song. But don't worry, I have a plan. Stay there. Don't move. Snake! To the boat! Whoa! - Run! Run! Run! - Go! He's right behind us! Faster! Uh, this way! Whoa! Okay, I think we're safe here. I guess I was wrong. Oh no, he's gonna kill us! Let him have it! - Get away! - Get back! - What else do you have in there? - Ha! Eat string, snake! Hey, wait. Did you hear that? That's Gabi. She's in trouble. Hey, Lutador! Leave them alone. If it ain't Noisy the Singing Rat. That's right. And noisier than ever. Bop bop bop bop! Stop making the noise. Yeah? Come make me. With pleasure. Excuse me, ladies. I'll be right back. Vivo, what are you doing? I don't know. But sometimes you gotta improvise. - You got this, Vivo. - Gabi. A kinkajou can't beat a python. You still running up trees, Noisy? You rats never learn, do you? Don't just stand there, schmoopie. Dig us a hole to hide in. I love you, baby! Oh no! Vivo, watch out! That's it. Okay. Enough is enough. - Huh. - You can't run forever! Sure, I can. Back in Havana, I do five shows a day. ♪ Whoo!

I was wrong about you, Vivo. I mean, I still think you really should be quarantined for ten days, but you did save us from an apex predator. So, I'm gonna let this one slide. So, we cool, right? Yeah, we're cool. Can we have the song back? Of course, the song. Wait, what? I ju... I just had it. Where did it go? Oh no. Andrés. Come in. Is he... is he here? Oh, señora. I'm so sorry.

I understand, but Marta is taking this really hard. Yes, she says she can't go on. Look, I'll check back in five minutes. Marta? Hmm. Andrés. Are you Vivo? You came all the way from Cuba? What are you doing here? "Para Marta." Andrés wrote this. For me? Thank you. He never told me he felt this way. I love you too, Andrés. Oh, Vivo, thank you. Señora? We're ready whenever you are. I have to go. And here I thought this concert was about saying goodbye to the old songs, but now, I have a new song to sing. You know, Vivo, Andrés would be so proud of you. Mwah. But, Mom, Vivo needed to deliver a love song to Marta. Do you hear yourself? Gabriela, this is crazy! You see? This is why I didn't tell you. I knew you wouldn't get it. Oh, ho ho ho ho, I get you all right. No. No, you don't. Not like Dad did. No, no, no. You're not doing that, Gabriela. He's not here. I'm here. And I know, I know I'm not your father. I know I'm not funny, and I don't do music. But you can talk to me. You don't even understand why this is important to me. Only Vivo does. Vivo is in Cuba. Vivo! Did you get the song to Marta? You did it. That's right. We did it. Wait. Wait. Wait. You were telling me the truth? Oh, Gabi. But still, you can't just go a hundred miles to Miami without telling me. I know. I'm sorry, okay? But I j... I just had to deliver tío's song. He... he didn't get to tell Marta he loved her. Just like I never got to tell Dad how... how much I loved him.
