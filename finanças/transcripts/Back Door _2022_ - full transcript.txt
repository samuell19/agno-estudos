Like, you know, I'm a upcoming artist. I'm trying to make it big like you. - Right. - It's not me, it's the labels. They come up with the pricing and I really can't do nothing about that right now. - Yeah, I can understand that and everything. But like we trying to fuck with you. Like we ain't trying to go to nobody else. Like I like your reputation and what you do. Know what I'm saying? - I respect that. The thing is I'm contracted, so the labels, everything, all the business pretty much runs through them. So it's nothing I could do at the moment. - You know how it is when you're trying to come up like, I need this right now. - Don't always think it's some money thing. Times is different. Make hits, kill the internet, start simple. When I was coming up, I ain't had a tool that y'all had, to buy cameras, get studio equipment, I had to hustle for months. So I know where y'all coming from. As long as you hungry and you keep going for it, nobody gonna get in your way. So do what you gotta do, feel me? - All right man.

Come on, we over here. - All right. - Oh shit, y'all (indistinct). The fuck is going on? - Good. - What up, y'all got the bread? - Nigga, you got that work? - Man, why the fuck I'm gonna come all the way out here if I ain't got that work. Come on, let's get this shit over with, son. It's cold man, it's cold. - You ain't gonna let niggas taste it first? - The fuck y'all niggas (indistinct) now? - Nigga that shit might be baby powder or some shit. - Baby powder. - Go ahead tester, work right there. - Where the work, bro? - Hold on, hold on, homie.

It's good? - [Man] This shit fire, where you get this shit from? - Don't worry about all that, man. Okay, man. Be safe. Don't fuck it up. Testers. (door opens) - What's up girl? - Hey babe. (indistinct). - Babe, I don't got it right now. I quit my job. - Quit your job? Like we don't got a fucking baby on the way? - Look Mario told me he has a better opportunity for me to get some money. Raise no ass claim, right now I'm working on getting some more. - So now you listen to Mario? You're following him? Twist, I don't want my baby growing up thinking shit like this is cool. He needs a role model. Get it together or I'm leaving. - What you mean you leaving? After everything we all been through. Now you trying to take my baby away from me? - I don't wanna leave, I just want better. And the route you and Mario is going, my baby don't need to be a part of. - Can I tell you something Diane? - Tell me anything. - Sometimes I don't know how to tell my brother no. He all I had since our parents died and we still got this crazy bond. - I understand that and I agree with you. Of course I want you to take your brother's side, but what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong. And if he can't decide to do right, then you have to separate yourself from him, brother or not. But I know you'll make the right decision. - Look, babe, I'm gonna do better. I'm gonna go make some money moves later. I got us, I promise. - All right, babe, I believe in you. - Thank you. Yo, bro, we need to talk. - If it's about that nigga I killed, bro, I do not wanna talk about it. - Nah, it's not even about that, it's about my girl. She need a few dollars and I feel bad 'cause I can't help her. 'Cause usually when I work, I get paid, give her. - Well, I can't help you right now. You gotta go out there and make some more money, man. Tell her to give you a few days, man. - I wish I never fucking quit my job, man. - Quit your job? Yo, don't come in here crying to me like a little bitch, nigga. I told you I got you forever. Nigga like always. - I always got your back, I always listen to you. But lately you been changing. - Changing? Changing how bro? - The same way with the guys, the money, everything. - Oh, so it's just me now. Man, them niggas about to kill me out, nigga. - Or else what? You gonna kill a brother like you killed that innocent guy? - Yo listen here, Twist. You always had the brains, the smarts, the talent. Oh, Twist did good in school. Twist this, Twist that. I finally found something I'm good at, bro. And you trying to take that shit away from me? Not gonna happen. - So what you good at, robbing and killing? - I can't help it, bro, it's like a drug. It's a rush. I love it. - You need help bro, for real. - Don't get on my bad side, Twist. - Yo, just forget about it. - Yeah, forget about it before you piss me off, nigga. - Yo, first off, one thing mommy told us to always stick together. You continue on this fucking path and I'm done. - Yeah, you better listen to her. 'Cause going against me is a bad idea. - [Twist] Yo, good night bro. - [Man] Yeah, good night pussy. - [Twist] All right.
