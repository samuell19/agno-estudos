Police are seeking the public's help in identifying three suspects for the brazen murder of four men believed to be members of the Russian Mafia. The murders occurred in the parking structure- There you go. Hey. No, no, no, no, no! No, put that away. It's our pleasure. Okay Okay ladies, have a wonderful day, hmm? - Bye! - Bye. I'm going to leave Dolf here. He can help you with the rest of the order. Okay. You stay and watch Adalina. She says you eat too much. What do you want me to do? Listen, find her another big catering order. And tell them to request coda pa pushti. She loves making those. How goes it? Another day above the ground. Amen to to that. Now this, this is from last year's crop; pulled 'em out before the ground froze. I think Adalina would like 'em. Ah, thank you, thank you. - She will appreciate. - Oh! Oh, what do we have here? Oh, my favourite. Jesus Christ, that's good. Now, the red dots, that's straight Crank. The blue, that's Mexican Speedball. The green is, uh, PNP. Same as usual. - Ah, you wanna test? - We're good, we're good. It's much too cold to sit around waiting. Why don't you guys get that loaded. Is there a problem? Very nice, very nice. - Be well, my friend. - Nice to see ya. Thanks for the pastries. You stick to the speed limit, use the turn signal, stay on the back roads. That Chief at Stone Creek Reservation, he has been trying to renegotiate so double count, make sure he's not trying to short us. If he does, break his arms. Can I help you? Hey, new guy, I'm talking to you! Dude, what were you looking at? Just heard the music. Are you gonna complain? No. It's the only way to drown out the rest of the noise around here, you know? Yeah. Yeah.

You know, there's a diner nearby. It would be warmer. I like the cold. It reminds me of Moscow. Ah. How's the family? Never have kids after the age of 50. I can't keep up. All I do is hand out money. And the beautiful Adalina, she's good, yes? - She is. - Good. You heard about that business, uh, with my associates? The reports didn't say who was responsible. The Aryan Brotherhood is responsible. We had a deal that was fair and was honourable. But these people have no honour. And now the problems is yours to amend. I don't see why. I've never had anything to do with them. The Ochstag voted. It's not our fight, Vladimir. I like how things are. We keep our heads down, stay below the radar. This complicates things. If they are coming after me, how long do you think it would be before they come after you? Strange how fate works, is it not? When this is over I will make sure that he is left alone. That should please you. Your pet, free at last. Did you know he was out? No. You'd have to kill me to put that on my body. You wouldn't have lasted a week, Malick. He coulda just punched his own ticket. And did it all. Guys like Lance, they fight. That's just how they're wired. If a man's born into violence, there's only two ways he can go. He can be a victim. Or you fight. You did everything you could. Hey, whatsup? Help you with something? Do you do coverups? Yeah, sure. What do you need?

Whoa, neighbour. Hi. You following me? Not a lot of places to get a bottle when the stores close, you know? I'm fucking with you. Oh. Man, what's your deal? Are you like, always a dick or just to me? I'm just not one for talking. Oh, gotcha. Wow, love the song. Great set, Anna. You remind me of Billy Jean Waters. "Nobody Knows When You're Down and Out." Nope, I've got nothing. It's supposed to be a compliment. I know I'm only small-town good, but thanks. That's no good for your voice. Hey, I'm back. Thanks for sticking around. You look good. You look old. Are you hiding from us or the Brotherhood? I ain't hiding from anyone. Just wanna be left alone. I came down there more than once but they said you wouldn't see me. The Russians fucked me. After all I did for them and for you. You let it happen. I did everything that I could. My hands were tied. You put an Estonian Captain in a fucking wheelchair for life. A direct descendant from the old country. What did you expect? - He baited me. - And you bit. He'll never walk again and you, what? You lost 15 years. All you had to do was walk away. Fuck 'em. Even now? Just get to it. I'm here to offer you an olive branch. The Russians, they are prepared to let the past go, let you free. And why would they do that? They need a favour. They assassinated a high-ranking Russian. Trying to move in on the meth distribution. You have no idea what you're asking me to do. Yeah? I think that should be enough to get you wherever you want to go. Lance, I promise, no one will come looking for you. What if I say no? Then everything you endured in prison would be for nothing. Freedom, real freedom, has a price. Can you imagine sleeping without a gun? I think you know this is the only option. Make peace with it. And we'll talk in the morning. Excuse me. Hi, honey. I am so not your honey. Hey! Friends of yours? How'd the rest of your set go? It went. Shoulda stuck around. I'm not much for crowds, even small ones. Well it woulda been really nice to play for someone who actually appreciated it. You know, there are places that appreciate talent like yours. You just gotta find 'em, you know? Man, I barely make rent, okay? All I have in my fridge are half-eaten noodles and a bottle of hot sauce. I have no idea how I'm gonna get to tomorrow so, Smoke Stack's the only place I got. Good night. Good night. Could you wait outside? Let me do what has to be done. I'll find a way. No, I want you to find out who the girl is. I need to be doing more, okay? The others- They don't respect me. Let me prove myself. You will have your time to make your mark. With them and with the Ochstag. Just not now. Unless? How do you know he won't run? 30 years of history. Fuck! ♪ Once I had a life as a millionaire ♪ ♪ Spending my money I didn't care ♪ ♪ Took all my friends out ♪ I can't. I can't be that guy. But you still are him, Lance. - I can change. - No. Human nature always bares its teeth. No matter what you tell yourself, you are who you are. And you know you have to do this. Kill them, kill them all. No witnesses, no loose ends. When it's done, I'll tell you where I left the money and the passport. And then, then we can talk about change. The fuck you want? Just got out of the joint. I'm looking to connect with my brothers. Where'd you do your time. Millhaven. T Block. What's your name, brother? Lance Hunter. Run him. It's for you. So you know I can earn. Let's get inside. Want a tag on the Yukon. How long you been out? Not long. Usually someone would let us know a new face coming by. Didn't know where I was gonna settle when I got out. Needed some time to breathe. I hear that. Well, you check out with my man in Millhaven. Says you did some heavy work inside. Anything for the Brotherhood. I'm wondering- Before you hit lockup, who'd you do to get pinched? Where are you from? Who you ran with, that sort of thing? I don't- I'll know everything soon enough. For now, we're just gonna wait. Ah, fuck. Is it done? It's done. Money and passport is in the air duct in your hall. It was there the whole time. I had faith in you. Good luck. ♪ Gimme your kiss already ♪ I'm gonna tell the Ochstag you oversaw the operation. No, no, no, uncle, just- Let me earn it on my own. So what now? What now?

I mean, what are you doing in this shithole town? At some point you're gonna have to pick: The music or this, this place. Who could give up all this, though? Look, I don't need a lecture, okay? Mhm. You're not my father. No, I'm not. But if I was, I would drag you out of here. Do whatever it takes to give you an opportunity. Yeah, all he gave me was bad dreams. Been on my own since I was 15, okay? No one's dragging me anywhere. Well you're gonna have to do it then. You and I should not end up in the same place. You deserve better. So, any problems? Buyers are asking for more. Sounds like Rainer's getting a new mining camp, so we should get in on that. Looks like there's room for growth all around. And that's more weight. We'll need to start sending two vehicles. So we have to make sure we have enough security. I'll go, I can take care of that. No, no you stay here. Dolf and Pieter, they can- They can handle it. Did you, um, find out about the girl? Uh, waitress, works at a bar, not much to know. Her and Lance? I'm not sure. What's he doing here? I didn't know you were coming. I know. How bad is it? A witness. 10-year-old boy. What did he see? Everything, including your man. He's in police custody now. It's only a matter of time before he IDs your man. Either to the police or to the Aryan Brotherhood or to both. How insulated are you from him? Enough. Hm. If he should talk and mention your name- No, no, he would never talk. Greger, this is a man who has just done 15 hard years because we put him there. This is a man who knows that we ordered a hit on him in prison. This is a man who knows that he can kill two birds with one stone if he talks. Put your dog down and anyone associated with him. Vladimir no, please, there's got to be another way. There is another way. I can insulate myself from everybody, including you. Vladimir, what a nice surprise. The beautiful Adalina! Oh, it is a sight for old eyes. Come, let me make you something to eat. No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. I have a stupid business meeting I have to get to. At least let me get pastries for the kids. No, no, no, no, not today, not today. But I promise you this, I will come back soon, and I'll bring all the boys. Just, uh, just business. Is everything okay? Yeah, mmhmm. - Never better. - Yeah? Yeah, okay. I need to ask something of you. Lance, he has to go. And I need it to be you who does it. The girl, you can't lead any breadcrumbs back here. Okay wait, are you sure that that's smart? Lance, he left me no choice. Just thinking. The last thing my, uh- my father said to me before he died. I never really understood it until now. I haven't heard you even mention your father since he died. He was a good man. Why are all men remembered as something they weren't when they were alive. Adalina? Are you happy? Of course. We could go anywhere. Back to Helsinki, back home. But this is home, here. We have a life, a business. This is where we grow old. Greger, how bad is it? Smells good, whatever's cooking in the oven. and don't do that. I can see it on your face. I'm here. You don't have to carry it all alone. It's nothing. You just concentrate on the bakery, okay? Oh, I'll just stay mute and-and smile and be a good woman. Don't ask questions, right? That's not what I'm saying. This is our life. It's not just yours. We built this life together. So if what we built, if what we built is in jeopardy, I have every right to ask, every right to be heard. You don't wanna know. I hear. I see. Don't tell me what I do or don't want to know. You've never wanted to know anything before today. I've never had the need to ask before. So you tell me, why do I feel the need to know now, hmm? Adalina! Before you do it, I want to speak to him. ♪ I've been blue all day ♪ ♪ My man's gone away ♪ ♪ He left my heart so cold ♪ Are you there? ♪ I thought that he'd be mine ♪ I'm coming in there.

If anything happens, we have to answer for it. Let us do it. Yeah? He ain't here. But he'll be back. How do you know? Oh, he'll be back. The girl ain't here either. There's a note that says she's at the Smoke Stack. Okay, we'll go to her. Lance, I had no choice. You need to know that. This isn't how I wanted it to end. Good bye my friend. It's okay, just let go. I'm gonna drop you at the bar. You stay on the girl, make sure she's alone. I'll go back and check on 'em. No. Greger says you're to stay away. Greger said you stay on the girl.

What will happen to the kid? The kid is too well protected by the police and the Aryans. Which means these ends have to be tied up now! I will take care of it. You better. Because if you have not done it in 60 minutes, I will tidy up the ends myself. What does that mean? Hey! Hey, uh- How's it going there? Good. I'm just waiting for the last batch to bake.

And nobody comes looking for me, right? You left a witness, Lance. And you have killed three of my men. There is only one way this ends. I'm out. The girl is safe. You have nothing. So why the call, huh? If this is truly over, hm? Oh, you need me to say it. You're looking for some kind of pass for you and the girl. She's not safe, Lance. Why are you fuckin' lying? Wait two minutes and answer this phone. He has Dolf's phone. Let him know that she is alive, and then you kill her. What? Make sure he knows it. Wait, can't we just use her to make him come in? Her alive gives him reason to be careful, cunning. Her dead, he turns into an animal. He will want to tear us apart with his bare hands. We will use it to our advantage.
