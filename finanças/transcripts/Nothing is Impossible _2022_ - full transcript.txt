The entire season is hanging in the balance here. It's back to the rack with another dunk! That's his second straight. Senior Scott Beck, with only seconds on the clock... That's six straight points for Beck. He shoots from deep in the paint. Here comes Beck. And it's a goal! Texas Christian wins! Beck on the dribble, Beck scores! Are you kidding me? Beck scores again! That's the most incredible shot I've ever seen. On the D. -Another last-minute save by Scott Beck. -Unbelievable performance... -...by Scott Beck. -Amazing! Scott Beck coming in 30 points a game, an all-American. What wouldn't you want in Scott Beck? Good morning, Knoxville. And the phones are lighting up. We're remembering Knoxville Prep greats but ones who could never quite make it to the big dance. The real upset this year is Scott Beck. Scott Beck. It's hard not to look at Scott Beck as a disappointment... Completely overlooked in the NBA draft. Remember that outside shot he used to have? It's really a shame to see someone like that. A complete disappointment. Heartbreaking. But more common than not. What a shame. Really a shame. Obviously, he didn't have what it takes to be a star in the NBA. So you're the culprit. What do you want? Shoo. Go away. Shoo. And now for the "Knoxville Minute." The traffic this morning is actually pretty light heading into downtown Knoxville. The heat wave, as we expected, arrived late last night. So it's going to be a bit of a scorcher out there today and pretty much in all of Knox County. Hope those air conditioners are doing their job. And as for you, our viewers, I hope you have a great day. Hello? Well, when was his appointment? I'm not sure why he didn't show up. Sometimes my dad forgets things. I'm gonna have to call you back and reschedule. Oh, yeah. I'll make sure he shows up this time. -Hi, Mrs. Walcott. -Your rent's due. I know. I'm sorry. And you need to feed this dog before it wakes the whole neighborhood. The thing is, it's not my dog. Well, she thinks she's your dog. What's her name? I don't know. I think her tag says Lucky. This dog look lucky to you? It's Lucy. Her name is Lucy. Okay. Well, have a great day. Thank you. -Oh, and another thing. -Yep. There's a lot of holes in my yard. Now, I don't know who's digging them, whether it's Lucy or you... -But it needs to stop. -Absolutely. I'll look into it. Look, no one's questioning Ryan Aikens' right to cut Dobbs and Moore. I mean, that's what happens when your daddy leaves you a professional basketball team. But who are we kidding? I'm questioning the logic. I mean, come on! With their star players gone and less than a month before the season starts, the Knights' roster looks more like an obituary. -Hi, Ruby. Are they here yet? -Half are. I can bet which half is not. Banks will be here soon. We both know he's not showing up, Archie. You got to remember, he's an old-school coach. Cutting Dobbs and Monroe, two best guys on the team, without consulting-- Dobbs and Monroe are both criminals. We all know that. Domestic violence, allegations of point shaving... Excuse me, I did not say I'd miss them. I'm just saying that it's embarrassing to a coach to cut his two best players without consulting him. Not to mention, the general manager. What do you think of Okoye? In the practice sessions he's been doing-- -Coach's office. -I called a meeting and where are you? Where I always am, Ms. Aikens, where the real work of managing this team takes place. Not that ivory tower of yours. Your father understood that. Every day that Dobbs and Monroe stayed on that roster, they shamed my father's team. They scored points. -They scored ratings. -My father was old-school. He coddled his players and ignored the accountants. I need players. There's a few I've got my eye on. Well, I have my eye on a stack of pending lawsuits, IRS notices, past-due vendor invoices. The truth is, we barely have the money to pay the players that we have now, and the board is threatening to move the franchise. So you tried to put out a fire by throwing gasoline on it. Maybe it's time I took up fishing. No, no, no. Hear me out. I may have a solution to this and it's a bit unconventional, but why don't we try open tryouts? -We'd look desperate. -We'll look like clowns. It's an event. It's unique, promotable. We could do a three-round process where the fans are engaging in drama and they have underdogs to root for. Are we rebuilding a franchise, or are we casting a reality show? Reality show that airs every night on SportsCenter and all day on social media and in the press. There could be some talent out there, coach. We don't know. Your father would turn over in his grave if he knew what you were doing. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a team to coach. Baker. He'll come around. As long as he has final say on the players. You all right? My father trusted me with his team, Archie. Your father had two great sayings. One of them, I won't say now, but the other one is: "Don't be afraid of losing, because winning doesn't teach you anything." And remember, it's not your father's team anymore. It's yours. $300 for new tires. $450 brake job. I have to go to work now, but when I get back... I expect a better attitude. Attention, all students. It's that time of year again. This Friday will be the official day to clean out all lockers. Anyone interested in trying out for the soccer team, please be on the south field today... Scott, I forgot my locker combination again. Okay, Darcey. I'll get to it. And are you the one that fixes the air conditioners? Yeah, I just fixed the one in chem lab. -Which one's broken now? -The one in chem lab. Hey, Scott. -How you doing, my friend? -Car just died in the parking lot. You know, when God closes a door, he opens a window. You okay, Nick? I'm just practicing my "pastor speak." I really think I'm gonna give seminary another shot, so I'm back in anger management classes. How many times have you flunked seminary school? Three. Okay. Four, all right? But that last one did not count. It was online. It's not like they expelled me. They just... removed my user ID and password. All right, just calm down. How can I help? Actually, if you would do me a favor and hang these FCA fliers up in the cafeteria? I'm gonna have my first meeting tomorrow. Sure. -Thanks, man. -Yeah. Are you gonna come to practice tonight? Depends on when I get done. Listen, I'm gonna tell these guys that they have to pay you to help me coach. This volunteer thing has been going on for too long. Yeah. I'll get there as soon as I can. All right. -Don't forget to hang them up. -Okay. Leave a message. Hey, Pop. It's me. I haven't heard from you in a little while. Wanna make sure you're okay. The doc called. Anyway, just... Just call me back, okay? Miss you. Thank you all for coming. This weekend, the Knoxville Silver Knights will be holding open tryouts at the arena. We're hoping to put some of that American dream back into this all-American team. There you go, Darcey. Another day, another lock. Come on, Cooper! Man, Grandma was slow, but she was old. Let's go. We have a game tomorrow. Hustle, guys! Hey. Sorry I'm late. Somebody got sick in the cafeteria. What's with the beef jerky? It's part of my anger management courses. Supposedly, it keeps me from blowing a gasket whenever I get riled up. Come on! You're gonna get fouled, Johnson! Don't step on the line! So did you hear? What? It's Ryan. At her impromptu press conference today, Ryan Aikens, Silver Knights' team owner, announced the team's plan to hold open tryouts -for local residents. -Unbelievable. I know, right? She still looks good. No. I mean, yeah. But open tryouts? Murphy! Under the basket! Let's go. Come on. What do you think? I haven't spoken to Ryan in almost 20 years. We didn't exactly end things on the right foot. Just say you're sorry and go to the tryouts. I'm pretty sure an "I'm sorry" is past its expiration date. Look, man, you were so close to getting to the NBA. Everybody knows you got robbed. That was almost 20 years ago. Those days are behind me. And what about the days in front of you? My father stopped seeing his doctor, my sink leaks, and my car needs a new electrical system. My plate's pretty full right now. That doesn't sound full. Kind of sounds a little pathetic. Hold this. All right, Murphy, for the last time, do I have to bring your mom to teach you the difference between left and right? No, sir. ...new owner of the Knights, Ryan Aikens, wasted no time on her surprising announcement. She's taking a huge risk and bringing her team much-needed attention. Hey. Okay. Next time you feel like barking, you chew on that, all right? Okay. Come on inside. Come on. Come on. Okay. ...local team's ambitious owner certainly has a lot on her plate. Let's take a closer look at the press conference. We're hoping to put some of that American dream back into this all-American team. We're hoping to put some of that American dream back into this all-American team. ...into this all-American team. ...American team. You need to go home and get some rest. Your daddy would tell you there will be plenty of time for you to second-guess yourself tomorrow. Thank you, Ruby. -Good night. -Good night, honey. -Scott. -Murph. You're here early. You think you can give my car a jump after school today? -When are you gonna get a new car? -When I get new money. What? Something on your mind? I just wanna know what I'm doing wrong out there. Are you nervous about the Clayton game tonight? Nothing. You're gonna do fine. Come on, man. Everybody knows that's you in the trophy case. You're the man. Come on, give me some advice. Yeah. You're too young to be stressing. Just have fun. I just wanna play in the NBA. You do, huh? All right, well, just, you know, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Have options. Yeah, well, coach says our dreams are God's way of telling us what we should do with our lives. Coach told you that? All right. Yeah. You know what? That's me in the trophy case. I was a Lion once. And this is me now. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Best advice I can give you, buddy. Welcome to the FCA. We are the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. But you don't have to be either to come check us out. We're made of a bunch of people from a bunch of different places. Yeah. No one showed up. I didn't think it was a good enough reason to cancel, you know, so... And what would have been a good enough reason? -Don't get smart with me, man. -All right. Truth is, I kind of needed the practice anyway, so... All right, well, practice on me. For real? Sure. Okay. Well, we can start from the discussion. In John 10:10... "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. But I have come so that you may have abundant life." What? Nothing. Go on. All right. Spit it out, man. I don't know. I mean, I'm just thinking about the whole abundant-life thing. Is that really the promise you want to make these kids? It's not my promise. It's God's. I mean, you see very many abundant lives around here, Nick? Because from where I'm sitting... I just see a lot of regret and hopelessness. And who's gonna pick up the pieces when things go south for these kids? You? God? Jesus? You know, you can't blame God for your choices, Scott. That's on you. Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I haven't been in a very good mood these last-- Fifteen years. All right, you know what? I think you got it under control. I'll see you later. We're getting our heads kicked in out there! And I don't see any heart. From none of you! You know what? Coach Scott might have something to add. Look, Coach Martin's working through some stuff, okay? So, yeah, just, you know... go out there and have some fun with it. You can't take this all so seriously. It's just a game. Go on. Wait. Come here. All right. You guys do have heart. But to win... you gotta use your heads. You have to be smart. You have to think. Average height of a Clayton player is what? They're big, coach. Yeah, they're bigger than us, right? Half their points are off rebounds. So every time a shot goes up, what do you do? You find your man and you box him out. Every time. For if we control the boards... then this game is ours. Bring it in. Murph, on three. "Lions" on three. One, two, three. Lions! Proud of you guys. You did it. Each and every one of you. Now, come on, let's head out. I'll catch up with you in a second. Hey. Good game, Coop. Thank you. Thank you. I'm happy to help out. We're gonna go eat some pizza. You wanna come? I gotta finish up here. Well, hurry it up and keep thinking about those tryouts. -I know you still want it. -What are you talking about? Come on. Everybody knows it. Word gets around. Are you spying on me? Look, I'm just saying. Why is this so important to you? How's anyone gonna let me pastor a church if I can't convince you that God wants you to live a full life? So I'm a test case. No, man. You're my best friend. Hello. Wait, he's doing what? Okay, Bernie. I'll be right over. Thanks. I paid for it! I can hear it! All right. Seven times in one night's plenty. -What do you know about it? -Take him, Scott. -Scottie! -I know, Pop. Come on. Let's get you home, Pop. -I love you. -I love you. Hey, Pop. Why are you making such a fuss over a song on the jukebox? And why aren't you going to your doctor? What's going on? Insurance stopped paying. So unless you wanna drive me to Canada twice a month... They said I need a new heart. I don't want a new heart. What would I do with it? The arena is getting prepared for what looks like a fun and exciting moment in the league's first-ever open tryouts. And more importantly, the community is ready for the first look at who will show up for this exciting opportunity. Look at her. She thinks she's somebody, now that her old man died. Ryan's okay. She quit on you, the minute she saw you weren't gonna amount to nothing. That's not what happened, Pop. A woman like that doesn't marry a janitor, Scottie. I guess you're right. It don't make a lick of difference now, anyhow. What's done... is done. It was that Elvis song. The one she liked. Needed to... hear it. "Lions" on three. One, two, three. Lions! Hello, Knights fans. Today, hundreds of hopefuls wait for their shot in owner Ryan Aikens' much publicized and criticized open tryouts. Go ahead and follow that group to the gym and run through the drills. -They'll let you know if you come back. -Thanks. Why the practice gym? Coach said nobody plays on the official court until they've earned the right. Good luck. Lord... I know I can't talk to my father. So I was really hoping that... maybe you could ask him... what I'm supposed to do, because I'm not... I'm not sure about anything anymore. And if that doesn't work, then... I was really hoping that you could give me a clue. Hey, excuse me. Tryouts are in the practice gym. I know, I-- I just was-- Scott? Is that you? Hey, Ry. Wait, are--? Are you trying out? Aren't you, like, 40? Not yet. -My birthday isn't until November 17th. -November 17th. How you been? Real busy. Of course, and... I'm sorry about your dad. Thank you. You look good. I mean, you look well. I mean, you know-- And... Good. Ms. Aikens, Archie's looking for you. I have to go. Hey, Ry. Are you really so surprised to see me? I mean, you must at least thought there was a chance I'd show up. Why would I think of you at all? Isn't that Scott Beck over there? Pretty good luck. Forget it, Archie. I'm not gonna trot out some old romance for the cameras. Couldn't hurt, though. It hurt the first time. What are you doing? Engaging the fans. Giving them some drama to follow. Well, the story begins for this exciting yet risky move by Ms. Aikens. Her father, a legend, now passes on his legacy to his ambitious daughter. We do know she has what it takes. The million-dollar question is, will someone show up and bring what she needs? -Did you see Ryan? -She's kind of hard to miss. -And? -And I don't want to get my hopes up. Why not? I mean, it's better to see the glass half-empty. So when it spills, you're not a wreck. Right. Okay. So our God, all powerful, fountain of all wisdom. -You've got to play it safe, right? -The abundant-life thing again. Forget about that. Let's go with your half-empty thing. Jesus came so he could take that glass, half-empty, full, broken, whatever. He came so that he could refill it. I'm pretty sure Ryan hates me. Okay, we can work through that. Oh, come on. Atlanta will never let him go. Make a deal with Atlanta. We don't have the money. What about the tryouts? How about Darryl Coates? His score is 23.2 per game, 6.7 on rebounds. -Wait, where'd he play? -Iraq, Qatar and Afghanistan. A war hero. Are we making headlines or rebuilding this basketball team? Hopefully both. This might be an interesting option for you. This should be good. Lucy. Come here. Look, all I have is some pizza crust, okay? All right. Where have you been? My car and I aren't speaking right now. Hey, don't argue with Pastor Lawrence. I need God on my side today. Thanks. Actually, I was... saving that for you. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Before we begin, I have a special prayer request for our very own Scott Beck. Scott, we are rooting and praying for you. Proverbs 3:6 tells us: "In all your ways, submit to him... and he will make your paths straight." Not all translations say it that way. If you humble yourselves before the Lord... all the answers to life's questions... are easy to find. Except Proverbs 25:2 says it's the glory of God to conceal a thing, so... A lot of times we go through life and we go through challenges and we-- We want to just stop and quit. What if the Lord would have quit upon that cross? -Thanks, pastor. That was a great service. -Thank you. So how you think it went yesterday? I don't know. I'm supposed to find out tomorrow. I coach a little basketball myself. -Oh, yeah? Like a church league? -Not exactly. We're at the rec center most weekends. -Come, the guys would love to meet you. -Yeah. I'm sorry, pastor. Excuse me. -Hello? -Pastor Lawrence. Love that passion. Yeah, I'm gonna have to challenge you on that Proverbs 3:6 straight-line thing. Hey, why don't you come by the office during the week? We'll talk about it. That was Ryan. She's on her way to my place. Do you want me to take you? Let's go. I'm not saying he's a heretic. I'm just saying he's not right. Pastor Lawrence is old-school. I'm what's happening now. Besides, I get my guidance from the Lord. He's got me exactly where he wants. Oh, she's here. You sure you don't want me to go in there with you? I think I can handle it. Was that Nick Martin? Yeah, he's still around. You want to come in? Since when did you get a dog? It's not my dog. You want some tea? Well, I'm not gonna pretend that this isn't weird. So, what's going on, Ryan? Well, I came to tell you that Coach Banks is releasing a list of players who've made it to the second round and... you're on that list. You just have to sign your life away. Is everyone on that list getting a visit from the team's owner? Just the ones that she almost married. Look, I know that I-- Why are you doing this, Scott? Why are you putting yourself through this again? Both of us. Well, it's not like I couldn't use the money. There's easier ways to make a buck than trying to play professional basketball at 40. Thirty-nine. And maybe I'm not going for easy. Look around. It's not like I got a lot to lose. Well, I do. You asked me if I thought you were gonna show up at the tryouts, but did you ask yourself what I might think or feel if you actually did? If I knew it was gonna upset you, I wouldn't have come down. What did you expect, Scott? You basically left me at the altar and then you just disappeared. I tried to call you, but they said you were in Europe. That was after I hadn't seen you in, like, a year. Look, I... Things didn't go the way that I had expected. Obviously. The draft. Yeah, I know. But it's not my fault that you didn't have a plan B. How do you know this isn't it? Look, I just came by to tell you that Banks is putting you through to the second round, and you're gonna get a lot of attention from the press. That's what a big part of this is. And you're gonna bet that they're gonna ask a lot of questions about us. Two sugars, right? I appreciate you coming by and warning me. I can't promise you anything. Of course. What's that saying about life's unexpected twists and turns and fate and all that? I don't know. I'll ask Nick. He's pretty good with all that stuff. -Is he still trying to become a preacher? -Yeah. The guy won't quit. Hey, what makes you think that you can make it now when you couldn't in your prime? Maybe I gave up too soon. Your dog needs a bath. It's not my dog. Good to see you, Jerry. You want me to cut through it and then pass it to Cooper, -or cut through it and then go--? -Come on, guys! I'm gonna have to get you on roller skates. That's what I'm gonna have to do. You know what? Get out there. Come on. You got me on pins and needles. What happened? You got it? Yeah, you-- Yeah! Hey, guys! Scott's a Silver Knight! Cooper on the wing. He's not available. Murphy, you're underneath. All right? Look, guys, we haven't beaten Broadmoor in 30 years, but they have their weaknesses, and we have the home-court advantage. Guys. Put your phones down. You used to be with the Knights owner? We're not playing the Knights. -She's hot. -Yeah. No. Come on. All that is just hype. -It doesn't mean anything. -It kind of does. You just went from the guy in the trophy case to the guy in the Knox Arena. I don't know. It's like maybe-- I mean, we can do it too, right? Right? Right, Scott Beck? All right. See you tomorrow. I mean, Scott-- Scott was amazing. I mean, he was one of the best. You hear me? You know what Scott's quality was? He would make everything look easy. Everyone was in shock that they never selected him. We know that in victory or defeat, your will and your plan are perfect. And we ask-- And we ask for patience, for safety, for courage and humility. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. -All right, guys. Good job. All right? -Sorry to interrupt. Kristina Walsh, Channel 6. I-- I am the coach of the Lions. Nick Martin. But you're probably looking for this guy. Scott Beck. Yeah... Yeah. Seriously? No. -No, thanks. -Scott. Please. The whole town wants to know what's going on. Five minutes. Okay. Considering your past romantic involvement with Ryan Aikens, do you think she can effectively do her job as the Knights owner? Let me tell you something about Ryan. After high school, a lot of people were surprised when she went against her Ivy League dad's wishes and enrolled in Texas Christian. She never used her family's money or influence for anything. And, yeah, cutting Dobbs and Monroe, that was a hard choice, but it was a choice towards integrity. And, yeah, I fell in love with Ryan. And so will this city when they see what she can do. The Knights are in good hands. Beck is joined by... The U.S. Daily Observer and Champion Illustrated are running stories on their sites tomorrow, so... Yeah, well, it may be a little too soon to tell, but I think that we might just turn this around. Never underestimate the power of a really good Cinderella story. Best not to leave them feeling foolish for believing. If you're worried about Scott Beck, don't be. Next round's a real punisher, and he's no college kid. He's gonna drop out before it's a problem for either one of us. Hello, and thank you all for joining. I am Kristina Walsh with the Channel 6 weather team. Leave a message. It looks like it'll be a beautiful day here in East Tennessee... Hey, Pop, I'm on television if you want to watch. Channel 8. I made it to the second round, Pop. Call me. Extra beef jerky for us today. It's Day 2 for the Silver Knights open tryout. Already, we're seeing standouts, like local high-school star athlete Scott Beck making a name for himself again with his outside shot. Hey, man. Coates. Yeah? I'm Scott. Hey, I just wanna say thank you. During the sprint, making it into a race, -the whole competition effect. -A competition? I look at you as a potential teammate. Well, either way, if you hadn't, I wouldn't be here today. Yeah. They look a lot taller in real life. I've coached basketball for 30 years. This is not how I saw my final year. If I had my way, I'd send all of you home right now. But after today, I'm gonna have to narrow it down to three of you. For you, this is an opportunity. For me? It's an embarrassment. And I apologize for that. Since some of you will not leave until you are carried off in a body bag, I'd like to get started now, so in the hopes that I can accommodate you sooner rather than later. Yeah. Scott Beck, give us a word. Aren't you a little old for this game, Beck? Aren't you? I'm a coach. I could do this till they put me in the ground. What do you got? A couple seasons, if that? I like my odds. I've run the numbers. Your odds? I'm one of the few on the court with real competitive game time. That leaves you with about a dozen good options. You got two good centers, but you only need one. And that guy Fletcher gets 20% more rebounds than the guy in the green shirt. But he'd have 13 fouls in this one scrimmage. And by my count, green shirt gets back to the goal a second quicker, which is why I told Coates he's gotta get back faster on defense. That's what you told him, huh? I would think after 15 years behind a broom that you would realize this game is about more than just numbers. Well, go on. Finish your dance for the cameras. Need a ride? Yeah. Why did you mouth off to Coach Banks like that? You must have known that humiliating him in front of everyone probably ended whatever slim chance you had to begin with. I'm tired of everybody thinking they know who I am and what I'm capable of. Fair enough. You wanna come to the game tonight? I'm real busy. We're playing Broadmoor at home. Even you couldn't beat Broadmoor. Yeah, but I'm... I'm smarter now. Wait for it. Wait for it. Wait for it. Now! Hey. You know, I haven't been back here since I graduated. I never left. Here's what we wanna know. A woman like you, why would you date Scott? I mean, I'm looking at zero game here. Well, he had it going on back in the day. I'm a witness. I'm standing right here, guys. All right, guys, come on. Let's get some grub. You know what? You certainly have a lot for someone with nothing to lose. I'm not really their coach. That's all Nick. Yeah, but they care about you. They're a great bunch of kids. After Mom died, Dad gave up. He's just mad. Mad at everything. Fell off the wagon. Oh, man, I'm so sorry. I had no idea you went through all that. So how did you end up back at Kings Academy? Well, it's a job. No pressure. I mean, after everything, I felt like I needed to think for a while. Well, you know... 15 years is a long time to think. I know. Well, after graduation, I got my MBA at Oxfeld. I spent the next five years in corporate finance. I got married. I traveled the world. Then I got divorced and I came back home. Daddy always told me not to date a player. I always assumed he just meant the kind on the court. All right. So how did you end up with the team? Trust me, I am as... shocked as anyone else. I think that half the city is expecting me to fall on my face and fail, and the other half wants me to, you know... The board wants to move the franchise. Leave Tennessee? Why? Money. You should know, in professional sports, it's all about the money. I'm pretty sure my father knew that that was gonna happen, and that's why... I'm here to finish what he couldn't. You love it? Basketball? I don't know. Ask me again when I can actually breathe. I get it. Expectations, they wear on you. Your life, your goals... none of it belongs to you anymore. Even your failures aren't yours. Because when you go down, you feel like you take everybody else down too. Please tell me that you're not pinning your entire future on this. Especially after what you said to Banks. I don't-- I don't really know that you have much of a chance. But I still have one, right? The chance. It's not up to me, I told you. Not entirely. You still have that hair clip that I got you for your birthday? No. Why? Well, not how I thought this night would end. Yeah. I didn't think we'd beat Broadmoor either. Is it too late? Too late for what? For all of it. For you, me. My dad, the Knights, Nick. That's a lot. Do you remember that Spanish Lit class that we took together during my junior year? -Not really. -How could you not? We had that extensive analysis of Don Quixote. The windmill guy? That's what you got from it? You wrote both our papers. That is true. I did. Oh, you were such a jock. Well, he said something like: "Take my advice and live for a long, long time. Because the maddest thing a man can do is to let himself die." So... don't die. I guess. Oh, no, that's impossible. -What time is it? -Oh, it's time to go. What's the matter? The press ran photos of us together last night. Afraid the other players will think that I have an unfair advantage? Oh, it's not that simple. You want me to go? Okay. I'm sorry. I just... Ryan, it's gonna be okay. I don't think it is. I don't know anything about anything right now, but I just know that my father trusted me and I cannot mess this up. -Ryan... -I'm sorry about everything. What's the matter? You made it into the final round. Great. And then there were three. The competition is fierce for the final two spots on the Knights roster. It's down to Air Force veteran Darryl Coates, fireman Clint Dawson, and most surprising, middle-aged Scott Beck, a former NBA hopeful who disappeared from the limelight almost 20 years ago. It makes you wonder what they're thinking. But we'll continue to cover each and every step of this story as it develops. Welcome to the FCA. We are the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. But you don't have to be either to check us out. In fact, we're made up of a lot of folks from a lot of different places. And you might be the folks now that wanna join us too. The man of the hour, everyone. I'm sorry I'm late. This is for you. Come on, guys. Don't look at me. I had nothing to do with it. We thought you would need it, since you're in the final round. Oh, come on. This is too much. We all chipped in, Mr. Scott. Yeah, but I already have a pair of shoes. Yeah, but you can't wear those janked-up beaters on TV. You gotta represent. Yeah, yeah, yeah. These are nice, guys. Thank you very much. Guys, let me ask you a question. How many here have dreams for the future? Yeah, Darcey. I wanna be the first female astronaut on the moon. That's great. Anyone else? FBI, counterintelligence. I wanna play in the NBA. That's good, Murph. Let me ask you another question. How many of you feel, as Christians, that your life is immune to failure? Like this string right here... do you ever think that your path to success is just a straight line that, with enough time and enough prayer, eventually you'll rise to accomplish fulfillment? Hey, Murph, would you tie some knots onto this? You know, I feel that sometimes Christians believe that they have a leg up in life. I think some of you feel the same way. You know, you've been Psalm 37:4'd for so long, right? You know, the desires of your hearts, the desires of your hearts... And yet now you've come to a place where you actually believe that's a promise. Would you put that on the floor, Murph? That's okay. Go on. Stomp on it. Go on. Stomp. Harder. Stomp! Like, you know, Jesus is supposed to be at our beck and call, isn't he? I mean, he's that genie in a bottle. Whatever we ask, he's gonna grant us every wish. Don't stop, Murphy. Stomp on it. Flatten it out. Hard! Come on. Drag it through the mud. Flatten it out. Hard, Murphy! Stop. Pick it up. Look at it. Pass it down. What if that string was told its entire life that it was worthless or that it would never amount to anything? What if it was told that it just wasn't pretty enough? Or smart enough? Or too old? Too fat? Oh, yeah. Life is gonna give you plenty of reasons to feel discouraged. All right? Plenty of reasons to lose your faith. Especially when it looks like that. Knotted up in a tangled mess. Darcey, would you give that to me? Thank you. God never promised us a life free from trouble. Or free from failure. In fact, Job 14:1 says that "Mortals born of women... few are their days, and full of trouble." That's not just for non-believers. That's for all of us. So the question isn't if you're gonna have to ever face failure. The question is when. -We have to. -Yeah. -While he don't stop us-- -Hey. Is something wrong with your phone? Is there something I can do for you, Ms. Aikens? You know I can have you fired, right? Or I could resign. Either way, the board's gonna run you out on a rail. Scott Beck was passed through to the final round with no intention of signing him. That's a fact. Why? Why would you do that? I didn't. I did. Scott Beck's too valuable to this franchise. Can't afford to let him go now. Everybody loves a comeback story. Add a little bit of "rich girl, poor guy" topspin to it. That's the stuff that dreams are made of. And, baby, dreams sell. Look, tens of millions of dollars in free publicity. The pre-season ticket sales, historic high. Dozen bids on my desk right now for the streaming rights to the last round and a larger share of the female demographic than ever before. I mean, you wanted to generate some publicity for your franchise, you did it. You should be proud. No, I'm not proud. No, not this way. Come on, coach. I told you from the start... I wanted no part of this. You let me know when you're ready for me to coach your basketball team. That's all right. Let him go. He'll get over it. Scott deserves to know the truth. No. No, he doesn't. No. You cannot risk that he'll run to the press. It'll destroy everything we built so far. The franchise... Your franchise will not survive it. This is gonna devastate him. Only if you tell him. You think I should cut my hair? What are you asking me for? Hey, you like this shaving cream? What's going on with you, man? I don't know. I just-- I feel like I got a shot at getting my life back. Scott, you've always had your life. You're just not doing anything with it. -Yeah, well, I owe a lot of it to you. -Yeah, well-- Wait. For real? Yeah. You telling me I ministered to you? That's awesome. Live for God and you'll never have a reason to quit. All right, just, you know, tone down the "pastor speak." You're starting to sound like a fortune cookie. -Yeah, you're right. -I'll see you later. Your daddy sat right there and worried about the same thing you are right now. What to do about Scott Beck. I put him out of my mind and moved on with my life. And then... Now that he's back, I'm just-- I'm afraid to lose him again. Well, that's his choice and you have to let him make it. If you're not honest with him, you take away his right to fight for you. Whatever happens, for the rest of your life, you'll know who he really is. I don't know. I don't know, Ruby, everybody says that Scott used me to get into the NBA. You don't believe that. Scott grew up blue collar in a working-class family. They didn't have two nickels to rub together. How do you think that feels when the girl he loves was born with a silver spoon? I always tried to assure him that that was never gonna be a thing. Whose voice do you think was the loudest? Yours or the one inside his head that told him he'd never be good enough for you? An NBA contract put you on equal ground. He didn't use you to get to the NBA. Darling, don't you see? He used the NBA to get you. No more people food for you. Your stuff is in the bowl on the floor. Looks like I got a date. We'll discuss your diet later. All right, guys. That. Thank you, guys. I appreciate this. Look at that. All right, you guys, nothing is impossible. I appreciate you guys. Thank you again. Hey, gorgeous. More paperwork for me to sign? No. Remember this big guy? One we'd order after winning a game. -Yeah. -Thank you, Kim. -So, Scott... -Look, I know. I'm sorry about last night. I wasn't thinking. For once, it felt good not to... Not to think, that is. Look, Ry, I'm not really any good at this. -But what I'm trying to say is-- -They're not gonna let you play. What do you mean? I was trying to do something meaningful. You have to believe that. But for Archie, I guess it was just all for the cameras. That's it? I'm done? I'm just--? I'm out? I'm sorry. No, look, you know what? It's... -Scott, listen. -I know. It's all good. -Can we talk about it? -It's good. Scott, wait. Talk to me. I might have even played along if you would have let me in on it. -That's not how it happened, I swear. -You used me, Ry! You knew that I never stopped loving you. You knew that I'd spend the rest of my life looking for your forgiveness. And you let me believe... that I still had a chance. I'm just like that guy chasing windmills. The entire season is hanging in the balance here. Senior Scott Beck, with only seconds on the clock... He shoots from deep in the paint. And it's a goal! Texas Christian wins! -Are you kidding me? -Beck scores again! That's the most incredible shot I've ever seen. That will send Texas Christian again to the state finals. -Last-minute save by Scott Beck. -Amazing! A lot of times we go through life and we go through challenges and we want to just stop and quit. What if the Lord would have quit upon that cross? -Hello? -Hi, Nick. Who's this? It's Ryan. Why, God? Why did you make me... think that I could get it all back... just so you could take it away from me again? Are you trying to punish me? Are you trying to show me something? Just show me. Show me, what? Just show me. Scott. What are you doing here? Let's go home, buddy. Look, if you need anything... Maybe it's not that bad, you know? Scott. Pastor Lawrence... I need your help. Yesterday he was thanking me. Now today I think he's blaming me. You didn't do anything wrong. You see, the problem is, Scott is missing the bigger picture. God's picture. If he's ready to talk to me, I think I can help him. But, Nick, you can't force him. Yeah, I know. Why are you forcing me to do this? I'm not forcing you to do anything. Pastor Lawrence wants to talk to you. Let's go. Keep it crisp. D up. That's it. Hey, Pastor Lawrence. Hey, Scott, come on over. Way to go. -Hey, Scott. -Hey. Spinal cord injuries, spina bifida, amputations, many are wounded vets. But out there, none of it matters. They refuse to let any of it define them. They don't even talk about handicaps and disabilities out there. Only opportunity. Body of Christ in action. Yes, we live in a broken, unfair world. But God is faithful. You might think you finished. Done. But God is not done with you. He's still working in you and through you. But you have to be available. You're still living, Scott. Still breathing. Where there's life, there's hope. It all just seems so impossible. You know, when God is going to do something wonderful, it seems he always starts with a hardship. But when God is going to do something amazing... he starts with the impossible. What do you say we go meet them? -They'd love that. -Not today. No, you're meeting them. Hey, guys. Scott Beck is here. Come on, gather around and meet him. Hey. Hey, guys. How you doing? Good to meet you. I'm a really big fan. -Real cool to meet you. -Nice to meet you too. Gunner. Nice to meet you. Heavenly Father, we come to you with our hearts bowed, Father, we ask that you would lift up our brother Scott to you and that you would bless him. Father, we ask that you would give us strength and endurance. No matter what the score, no matter what the odds. We ask you these things in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen. What are you doing? Come on, get dressed. I'm taking you to the doctor. I told you, there's no point. You're alive, aren't you? Then you might as well stay that way for as long as you can. Come on, let's go, Pop. You don't understand. You don't think that I understand, Pop? I understand more than you think. That's why we're gonna get you into the program. We'll go on back to church, we're gonna do... whatever it takes. But you have to leave this pain behind you. You don't think that I miss her too? You don't think that I carry that around with me? We're doing okay, aren't we, Scott? No, Pop. But we will. We will. This is it, Silver Knights fans. Today is the final day of owner Ryan Aikens' ambitious experiment. And our very own Kristina Walsh is on location just outside the arena. People are gathered today and the excitement is palpable. You would think that this was a playoff game. Scott's not showing up, is he? Doubtful. You told him, didn't you? Then what am I supposed to tell the press? Oh, well, he just didn't show up. Scott made his decision, and we just have to move forward without him. Oh, without him. Oh, okay. Absolutely great. Hey. Where you going now? You know they don't allow people to be barefoot on the court. I own this court. Good point. Why are you here, Scott? You keep asking me that. I guess I wanna do more with my life than just give up. I don't wanna be Scott "What a Shame" Beck anymore. It was shame that... kept me from seeing God's purpose for me. Kept me from you, Ry. You deserved better than that. We both did. I'm sorry. You got an H. Look, I didn't use you. Maybe there was a part of me that saw what was going on, but... another part that was just afraid to lose you again. It's okay. As Nick would say, I'm exactly where God wants me to be. You know that saying you were asking me about? About the twists and the turns of life. I mean, I suppose in the end it could be called fate, but to me, it's more a matter of faith. What's the score? You tell me. Nice shot. Looks like they're getting ready to start without me. The tryouts? But why? At first, I wanted everybody to see me win. But now I think there's more people out there that need to see me not lose. What's the endgame? We don't always get to see the finish line, Ry. You know that. But he guides us one step at a time. And it'll make a great story for our kids one day. Oh, you do realize that I just asked you to marry me, right? You don't have to decide now. Just, you know... Think about it. Ah, I got it. The ball's in my court? That's a good one. The stands of this tiny practice gym are filled with fans, family and friends. However, I'm looking around, Scott Beck is nowhere to be seen. Now that we're all here, let's get the show started. How'd you get him to come? Oh, I couldn't stop him. Scrimmages. Three-on-three. This side, black. This side, white. You have three minutes to get to know your team. Then we play ball. Hey, Hal. Come sit with us. Good to see you. Listen, this is yours to lose. Read that contract that you signed? They don't have to hire anyone. So just relax. Have fun. Make it count. -Yeah, what about you? -Don't worry about me. All right? Just keep your head in this. By this time tomorrow, you'll be a Knight. All right. -Jeffries, right? -Yeah. -I'm a fan. -Thank you. You score 92% of the time from offensive boards. -Appreciate that. -Yeah. Blue four. All right? Hang out in the paint. And when the time is right, you'll know what to do. Whatever you say, coach. Gentlemen, it's an honor. Don't you think he should come out more like that? Be more able to work? -That work? -Yeah, that's better. Your boyfriend's doing pretty well out there. Like a man with nothing to lose. Don't you think we should end this thing? Before they start building statues to the guy. I'm about done with you telling me what to do. Scott Beck. Every man here ran the suicide in less than 35 seconds. Your best time is 37.5. Legs are the first to go. I'm sorry, son. Coach. What's happening? It's all about the numbers now. I can do it in 35. Don't you understand what's happening here? I do. I can do it in 35. Fine. On the line. 36.5 seconds. Not good enough. The Knoxville Silver Knights organization thanks you, Scott. I can do it. Man says he can do it. 36.1. 36.1 seconds. Not good enough. I can do it. You've given it your best. You can hold your head high. Put the time on the board. Please. 34.7. All right. There's a lot to applaud here, but there's actually only two slots available. And I think it's obvious that Coates and Duncan are your men. Come on, look at him. He's at death's door. We need players who can run all day and still play basketball. Beck. How about a little one-on-one? Mills. Get on him. What? Have you lost your mind? What? An NBA player could do that all day and every day. Are we not recruiting NBA players? Is that not the goal anymore? You show them, Scottie. Don't let them beat you. Show them what you're made of! I want to play in the NBA. First female astronaut on the moon. -FBI. -You're my best friend. You're still living, Scott. Still breathing. When God is going to do something amazing... he starts with the impossible. Ball. Blue four. Come on, Scottie! You got skills, son! Beck. You know I can't offer you a player contract. The team couldn't afford the insurance to cover it. But I can offer you a contract... as an assistant coach. -Did you know about this? -No. When did you come up with this contract? On the first day of tryouts when I saw him in the parking lot. And by the way, the answer's yes. -Yes? -Yes. She said yes! It's been quite an offseason for the Silver Knights with the sudden illness and passing of coach Russell Banks. It's up to former assistant and now head coach Scott Beck to bounce back from a poor finish in the playoffs last season. Moore, pass to Jones if he's open on the wing. But you've got to make that strong side cut. And who's my big at the top of the key? That would be me. Smart man, Murphy. All right, gonna turn it over to our team chaplain, Nick. Bring it in, gentlemen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for every blessing you have given us. We want to ask in the midst of our struggle that you help us to never give in and never give up. We ask, Lord, that you protect us from all injury. And in Jesus' name, we play. Amen. -Amen. -Amen. Gentlemen, please. Let's win this one. Good luck, gentlemen. One, two, three. Silver Knights! Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Knoxville Silver Knights!
