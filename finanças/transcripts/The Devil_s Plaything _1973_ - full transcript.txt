(crows cawing) (drums) (heavy breathing) (heavy breathing) I am the housekeeper. Welcome. We shall show you to your room. I am Monika Tarnac. I am expected. Welcome. I am Miss Krogg, the housekeeper. You must excuse us. We no longer have electricity. Miss Donev, Sonya shall see you to your room. Miss Tarnac, Morgana shall take you to yours. - Can't we stay together? - In the same room? I'm afraid that is out of the collection. The instructions from your late aunt... I'm sure that will be alright, Monika. And this is the great hall. You and Fraulein Vorash are direct decendants of either Dania Borisov - the Baroness - or her sister Ulla. They each had a female child who were raised by Ulla after the death of the Baroness. The two children were nearly the same age. In those times of upheaval and chaos, the trail of lineage was lost. Then it is not certain who is descended from the Baroness. That is correct. (Doorbell ringing) Our car was wrecked back in the mountains! I am the housekeeper. Welcome to Castle Vaga. I'm Peter Malenka. And I am Doctor Julia Malenka. I understand your motorcar was wrecked. People seldom drive into these mountains. The roads are very bad. If we could stay the night, in the morning we would find an inn. There are no inns in these mountains. May I ask what brings you to our mountains? I am doing a study of the local superstitions. My brother Peter assists me. If you wish to be our guests, you and your brother are welcome to stop at the Castle Vaga during your stay. You are very kind. (drumming) (groaning and whimpering) Julia? Were you here the whole time? I just came in. I heard you crying out in your sleep. Perhaps we should leave this place. Peter, you know the significance of these crosses of garlic? You must never remove yours while we are here, especially in the dark of night. Hello, Doctor! It was a lovely ride. Don't you ride? I'm a terrible rider. I'm afraid of horses. And I'm afraid of ghosts. Did you hear that weird chanting last night? - Yes, I heard it. - The chanting has something to do with the superstitions. Yes, about the Dania Vaga. The ancestor of Miss Tarnac and Miss Varash. In medieval times the Baroness was a dreaded figure. Those who opposed her, or even displeased her, were put to death by impalement. After the blood uprising that deposed her, the Baroness was chained to her impaling stake and burned by the women of the village. The revolt had been led by her sister, Ulla Borisov, and the handmaiden Gia Donashova. Dania Vaga was known the warm blood of impaled victims, so the superstition grew that she was a vampire. The furious and fearful women wanted to destroy her completely. To be destroyed, a vampire must have a stake of wood driven through its heart. The Baroness was burned and her body destroyed. Without the stake of wood in her heart. As the flames enveloped the Baroness, she screamed that she would one day return in the body of a descendant when she quench her thirst on the blood of the women who had burned her. The women in the town led an exodus in the face of this threat. They didn't want their blood to be the well from which the vampire returned. I told you that I was afraid of ghosts... but this sounds like nonsense to me. - I think it's interesting. That all happened four hundred years ago. Why has no one returned? That's hard to say. Perhaps because people just feel the evil. The spirit of the Baroness... as it walks the hills. Doctor Malenko, do you believe that the spirit of Baroness Vaga is really afoot in these mountains, in this day and age? I believe in the existence of such spirits, and that they are able to invade the bodies of sympathetic and receptive persons. Of course, if other circumstances are right. - A devoted medium must be present. - Devoted medium? A zealous and dedicated high priestess, in effect. One whose ardor itself can bridge the gulf of darkness that separates the living from the undead. - Undead? - An expression used by superstitious peasants when referring to vampires. You know a great deal, Doctor, about old wives tales. - A great deal. - Yes, Fraulein Krogg. A great deal. (groaning) (horse naying) Girls, please be seated. Make yourselves comfortable. These documents are quite lengthy. The Castle Vaga. The 3rd of May, 1969. I, Doria Dubchekova do herewith my last will and testament. The Castle Vaga, its estates and titles shall be shared equally by Helga Vorash and Monika Tarnac, provided each resides one full year in the castle. I some ways I do look like her. Samana, you're very pretty. Why do you stay here? Perhaps I'm under a spell. A spell? What nonsense. You think spells are nonsense? Some spells make you tremble with the chills of fever. Other spells make you seize with unfilled desires. Make your juices flow, hot and burning while fingers warmed in the fires of hell set your nipples afire and open your womb to the will of her priestesses. (clap!) I'm sorry, Samana. I suddenly became dizzy. Just lie down in your bed and everything will be alright. (drumming) (eerie music) (screams) Julia, what do you make of this? I don't know. - I had a terrible dream! - We heard you cry out. Someone was calling me. (chanting) (horses naying) (faint chanting) - Please, can we meet outside? - Outside? Perhaps in the stable? Please don't disappoint me. Your wine. Fraulein Vorash? Yes, Doctor? - I believe that you are in a great deal of danger. -I? I believe that spirit of the Baroness Vaga walks these corridors. I know. Looking for a living body to invade. Perhaps one night you'll awaken to find me standing over you with bared teeth... A thirsty vampire in my form! No. You won't be the vampire. When a vampire is to be reborn there must be blood for the vampire to suckle upon. Hostile blood. The kind of blood that might flow in the veins of a descendant of one of the women who burned the Baroness. You really think I'm in danger? Well, Doctor, I think you're in danger. In danger of losing your precious brother... to me. The doctor knows too much. I've got to remedy that. (wolf howling) Enjoying our full moon, Doctor? It's beautiful. You have a very strong will... Doctor Malenka! Doney absolutely worships her friend. She would do anything for her. And the boy? We shall contact him again. It shall amuse me to make him her servant. She wants him. - I feel that, too. - Of course, she wants him. She shall need many lovers. Just as she has always needed many lovers. And the other one? You know what we must do with her. We must tempt her. Have her ready for when she returns. Fraulein Donev? May I have a moment with you? You know a great deal about us, Fraulein... About her... I love her. She doesn't know it, but I love her. Then you would serve her if you could? I would do anything for her. Anything! (drumming) The doctor has a cross of herbs... She surely has given him one. I cannot contact him! I cannot waste time. We have much to do tonight. He has a cross of herbs. Get it to me. Get it to me. I must have the cross of herbs! Get it to me! Get it to me! I must have it. Helga, wait! Don;t run away! She didn't take it. She didn't take it. I cannot worry about him. I must get to her. She must be prepared. Cleansed! Julia, you have looked very uneasy all morning. That's because I am uneasy, Peter. If we stay another night, we are asking for destruction. - But the crosses... I slept very easy last night. - There are certain forces afoot that even I don't understand, Peter. Things are closing in about us. Those crosses may be think barriers separating us from destruction. If we left now... we could get far enough, even by foot. The last time we talked, Helga refused to go. Peter, you fool. You mist leave her, and her legacy. I love her, Julia. You love her? She's a little oversexed harlot. That won't do any good. Please. Make it stop. - Make this throbbing stop. - Perhaps... if you are a good girl. Perhaps... if you take his amulet from him. You shall take the cross from him, won't you? Oh, yes. Anything to make it stop. It shall stop if I get that cross. (chanting) The cross! I must get it. I must get it. It is almost dark. Remember... the throbbing will be relieved when he is without the cross of herbs. Dark... almost dark. Almost dark. (Wanda chanting) Why do you stare at ne? You want my eyes to hold you. I know you want my eyes to hold you. The time of the moon is almost right, Doctor. Peter! We must leave tomorrow. - In the daylight. Early. - I know, Julia. We must leave. With Helga... or without her. Fraulein Vorash, she wishes to see you. Peter, you've come. Darling... you must listen to me. Demons surround us. They want to destroy me, my body... my soul, my mind... oh please help me. Peter! Promise you'll help me. Promise. I promise. If you don't help me, right away, I'll be destroyed. - Please, you're hysterical. - Look at me! They're destroying me! You must always wear this. If you do, I can help you and they can't reach you. Never remove it as long as you're here. Take it away! Take it away, before... Now... Doctor Malenka is in our grasp. And vengeance shall be Varga's. For, you see, the doctor and her brother are close. Very close. You think that they've... But they might. -Fraulein Krogg? - Yes, Doctor? Why are there no children in this castle? Even a superstition need someone to carry it on. There shall be. Sonya shall have a child, with Eric Dorisov. She doesn't look pregnant. You know very well, Doctor, that tradition dictates that mating takes place only at certain moons. Besides, Doctor, you know we are very selective. Women who served in the house of Vaga... You mean priestesses. If that please you to say, Doctor, the the priestesses of Vaga are mated only with men descended from the knights who had served the Baroness. Such a mating, Doctor, shall be this night, according to your own writings. Then you've read my treatise on the superstitions of Vaga? Oh, yes. You have great insight for one descended from Donashova. - Donashova! - You didn't know? You and your brother are descended from the traitoress Donashova and the faithful knight Gregor! Donashova, who out of jealousy betrayed her mistress and cast her lot with the fraticital rebel Ulla Borisov! The blood of Donashova is your blood, Doctor! Your blood! (drumming) Is something wrong? A great deal is wrong. Have you seen Helga? She's sleeping like a baby. For some reason, they have removed the pressure from her. You seem very disturbed. You are familiar with my paper, The Legacy of Vaga? - Yes - We are descendants of Donashova. - How do you know that? - Wanda Krogg has told me. Why are we here? Why are you here? I don't know. I truly don't know. Good night. I feel that it is a mistake for us to be apart in the night. Peter... you must not remove your cross for any reason! (birds chirping) They make a beautiful couple, Doctor. Tonight is the night of the vampire, Fraulein Krogg. Yes, Doctor. The night of the vampire. It occurs once every nine years. I can't let it happen. You can do nothing to prevent it, Doctor. You see, a flame burns. A flame that never went out. The same flame that burned the beautiful body of the Baroness Vaga. Ignited from embers scooped up by Uli, the personal maid of the Baroness. From whom I am descended directly through the line of our family. And you know, Doctor, that the spirit of Baroness Vaga lives in those flames that we've kept alive for over three hundred years. Darling, I know you shall dismiss this as pure superstition but the cross I gave you is the reason you feel so well. It is protecting you from some force. I don't know what it is. My sister Julia thinks... Peter, let's not be serious. - Good morning, Doctor. May I help you? - I want to speak with Fraulein Tarnac. - She's asleep. - I'd like to see her anyway. - That is quite impossible. Fraulein Tarnac! Fraulein! I must speak to you! - This room need some light. - I cannot let you do that. - I think you shall! I must not permit you. I shall kill you first! (groaning) Out of my way! I am going to find my brother and leave! I think not. You fool. You cannot stop us! Join us before it is too late. You have the blood. Within these walls you can have him. Outside, they frown on a woman who wishes to be with her brother. You need only share him... with her. With... with her! Everything must be made ready for tonight! Peter! Peter! The sun has set. Our little winged cousins have already left the darkness of our towers. The hour of the vampire draws near. Iris, undress and bathe me. (rustling sounds) (bats squeaking) (drumming) Oh God! I can't let it happen! Peter! Peter! Peter! Helga! Monika! Where is everyone? Her! I want her! (moaning) Oh God! Don't let this happen. (bat squeaking) Oh, Peter. Where are you? Helga Varash and Peter Malenka, you spend the night together in the ruined cabin in the valley. Do you hear that? Oh, Peter. Where were you, Peter? I almost went mad when I couldn't find you. Where were you, Peter? I spent the night with Helga, in an abandoned cottage in the valley. Peter. We let something terrible happen last night. The vampire has returned! Oh, come on, Julia. I mean it! I was standing in the entrance hall, a wild, hot wind rose. It tore off my clothes. Wild bats clawed at me. They left me naked before I had the strength to raise my cross and drive them away. Julia, it must have been a dream. You surely can't believe these old wives tales about vampires. Peter, I've been studying these old wives tales for years. Julia, I'm to meet Helga after breakfast. You're free to join us, if you wish. Come on, get dressed. The three of us shall go for a walk in the forest. Helga. You must leave here. But, Peter, we must leave now. Doctor? You are welcome to take two of our horses to speed you on your journey. I don't ride, Fraulein Krogg. By nightfall, they shall be back. Mmmmmmmm.... ...mmmmmmmmmmm.... Peter, what is the matter? That sound! Can't you hear it? I hear the wind in the trees. Somana? I hear the bats, Somana. Peter and the doctor are returning. The sun has set, Baroness. The doctor cannot ride horses. But wait until she straddles our stake, Somana. It'll take days, Somana, days. And in the watch I shall watch. (wolf howling) So, Doctor... you have returned, as I knew you would. (bats squeaking) Our winged cousins of the night. They call me. They call. I must have her. I must have her blood! You shall, mistress. The boy. He is ours to use. - May I come in? - Of course. One thing I am sure about... my feelings for you. I remember what I was thirteen. Or, perhaps fourteen. You let me touch your breasts. We were very young. Was that wrong? Oh, no, Peter. Not wrong. Take off the amulet. It's in the way. ...mmmmmmmmmmmmm.... We've both always wanted this. Perhaps it's better if we... The cross! Where is it? You're a woman of science! You can't believe in such nonsense! He has passed out of your control, Doctor. Perhaps you're right, Fraulein Krogg. You have time before sundown. You could leave him with us. That's what you are thinking, isn't it, Doctor? That is what I was thinking, Fraulein. But I won't leave him. He won't go with you, Doctor. Perhaps he shall, Fraulein. The night shall have you, Doctor. Perhaps, Fraulein. Perhaps. Alright, at least let me try to help you. I don't want help. (chanting) Peter, wait. Wait! (chanting) I am here, Mistress. Peter... make love to me. Why? (hissing) (Peter's voice) Julia... Julia! Let me in! I must have been wandering all night. I found myself in a corridor, as if I had been sleepwalking. (chanting) Peter! Take it away! Please take it away! I'm going to meet the Baroness. She means to have her vengeance this night. She means to have me impaled. If she cannot have the doctor. Helga! Helga! Peter! Peter! (squeaking bats) Helga! Helga, don't! Helga, don't! You have decided to take the place of Fraulein Varash? First I want your blood, but not all of it. I shall leave enough to make wet my stake of impalement. (wood cracking) (screaming) At last, they are free. And the Baroness, at long last, she is at rest.
