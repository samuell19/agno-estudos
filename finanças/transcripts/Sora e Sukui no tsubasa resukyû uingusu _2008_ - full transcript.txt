As first female Flight Leader, she wants Kawashima to excel. Right. Welcome back. Thank you. Commander, welcome back. Welcome back. - Katsunuma, tailcone. - Yes, sir. 2nd Lt. Kawashima! Sergeant Sena. Explain yourself! Pardon? What thoughts distracted you during pick-up? The craft was unstable. The pilot holds the lives of both rescuers and survivors. If we can't count on the pilot, we can't make rescues! Commander. It was inexcusable. Lives are in our hands even in training. Yes, sir. Training as if it's a mission. A mission as if it's training. Understood? Yes, sir. I'll send you to the Zen temple if you do it again. Pardon? Focus! Guide to Komatsu Airbase Komatsu Air Base Location Chart Are you the one that almost crashed in training? I'm Yokosuka from 306 Squadron. I'm Haruka Kawashima from Komatsu Rescue. The rookie in Rescue. Everyone knows. We're both pilots. You may have to rescue me someday. If that happens, you can count on me. Don't jinx me. Sorry. See you. Say hello to Ex-F. Ex-F? Air Self-Defense Force Komatsu Rescue Commander Lt. Colonel Kikuta How is 2nd Lt. Kawashima? She seems down. Are you concerned? It may look like favoritism? I believe she will make it. Sorry about yesterday. I was feeling down. Feeling better? Well, maybe. We service your UH like this to ensure it performs at 100 percent. So you have to fly it with all your effort, too. You're right. Actually, I'm anxious sometimes. Worried I'll miss something. I used to belong to the Eagles and serviced all their bikes. Eagles? Bike patrol? No way! Motorcycle hot-rodders. Really? I'd never guess. Back then, I didn't feel any pressure. But this is different. Of course. Captain Oda, you're here? 2nd Lt. Kawashima. Don't fret about that mistake. Or I won't want to fly with you. I'm sorry. No apologies. Captain Oda was an Eagle. A hot-rodder? Not that! I mean he flew F-15. Really? Lock-on engaged. Break! Red II behind. Target lock-on. Fox II, kill! Mission complete. RTB. Captain Oda, why'd you switch from F-15 to choppers? Just following orders. Captain Yokosuka said to say hello. Yokosuka? He's such a meddler. We were together in aviation school and our first assignment, Hyakuri Airbase, 204 SQ. Always together. Komatsu Airbase Women's Barracks Cheers! I like it here. Wish I lived here. You can't! Non-commissioned officers only. Being 2nd Lieutenant is no fun. Getting lectured by Sena. Sergeant Sena is severe with Haruka. - Is he? - You know why. Know what? Don't you see? Sena likes you, Haruka. Is that true? No way. That's why he's so severe. Just like a schoolboy! - So? - And you, Midori? You like one of the superiors. Who? Which one? Captain Goichi Yokosuka, 306 SQ! Enough of that! Yokosuka is... The founder of the Eagle hot-rodders. He realized his longtime dream of becoming an F-15 pilot. So, he's out of my league. Alumni sometimes fall in love, Midori! It'll happen! Get serious, you two! It's been one hour since reports of Isemaru 15 in distress. But due to bad weather, no call-out yet for JCG, Japan Coast Guard. Among families gathered near the harbor frustration is mounting!

Rescue Komatsu, Rescue Helios 87. 3 survivors on board. RTB Komatsu, estimate 03:35. Continuing would have used up our fuel. You'd have gone down. A decision to return is part of our duty, Kawashima. Yes, sir. However... For me... It's so tough that we failed to rescue him. Dismissed. Excuse me. Excuse me. Get lectured by the commander? The Zen temple is worse than our training. He sent me there. I had trouble too, as a new recruit. Remember the Kobe earthquake? At that time, Self-Defense Force came late. People who died that time might have been saved. One of them was... My younger sister. I wanted to save her. If alive, she'd be your age. But rescue can't be based on emotion or idealism. I got lectured a lot too. Sent to the temple? Just one time. Meditation was bad, but the food was worse. I dried out with no lard! I'll do my best! I'm counting on you. You'll be fined next time. Okay. Kawanishi! Rescue on North face of Mt.

Report received that Helios 87's engine control unit is being inspected. There are always signs of trouble. It's a pilot's duty to sense that. Yes, sir. Haruka. What's wrong? Midori. Sergeant Sena has cracked ribs and a broken toe. He'll return in a month when these minor injuries heal. I see. Cheer up. I knew this would happen someday. Midori feels responsible for it. If I'd checked properly, this wouldn't have happened. What do you mean? Your service is always flawless. I knew this would happen. No matter how careful I was, I couldn't stop worrying. I hate this job. I can't continue! Bar Eriko Maybe I shouldn't ask him now to tell Midori it's not her fault? Good evening. Hello. Drink with an old classmate? Beer, please. Maki, when are you come back? Get dumped again? No way, I'm still popular. Beer, right? We haven't drank since you went to rescue. What's with the long face? Talk to me, but not about women or money. A medic got injured today? Don't let it get you down. He wasn't hurt badly. You know how I feel? I don't, I'm not an Ex-F. Oda, don't run away! Don't be down over choppers. What's your problem? Talk to me. Hello. What's this? Rookie protecting her superior? You said those things to cheer him up, right? What's that mean? Haruka, enough. Your junior colleague, Midori, is also upset about this. She feels responsible for it. Seems rescue is also tough. Madam. I'll pay for both. What's with him? Fighter pilots make no sense to me. Help yourself if hungry. Meiko Crap! Captain. Good morning. Hello. What a nuisance! My first ride in ages and the engine stops! I'll take a look. Okay. You haven't done this for years. You used to change my bike's muffler and oil cooler. I owe you a lot. Amazing! That's you, Midori! How about taking a ride together? Captain. Why'd you close the air screw?! What?! I can't hear you! Artemis 20, marker dropped. Helios 87, Roger. Heading to training area. To Komatsu Rescue Squad: Thanks for your quick response for my sick daughter. We're done! Welcome back. You look better. Welcome back. It's all yours. Haruka! Thank you. She was going to quit? Yes, I was afraid she really would. Sorry, I should've... Midori is okay now. We're not flying alone. Airbase Office To Miss Kawashima in Komatsu Rescue Squad From Aya Haruka? What's wrong? I have to tell you something. Yes? Aya... What is it? The surgery went well, but pneumonia set in. This morning... ...she passed away. No... From Aya To Miss Kawashima: Thanks for bringing me to the hospital. When I'm well, please take me for a helicopter ride. From Aya It's a terrible shock for Kawashima. Many things happen if you're involved in rescue. Those we saved, those we couldn't save. We never forget our missions. We failed to rescue your pilot father because we ran low on fuel. Why we couldn't rescue your father? While you still in grade school, you asked me in tears. After joining rescue, I learned the pain of failure. If I despised you, I wouldn't followed my father into this SDF career and being at here. We all get over such things. As for Kawashima. I believe she will make it. 2nd Lt. Kawashima. This is an order. Deploying when you're not in top condition hinders the squad. However... Take a holiday. Kawashima. Take three days off to deal with your feelings. Am I being sent to the Zen temple? Looks like you don't need to go on a diet. Want to go there? Yes, sir. I mean, no. Haruka! Yokosuka told me. Try to cheer up. My mother always says this bar is soaked with tears and sweat. She's always treated SDF people like her own kids. Hello. Some were never seen here again after leaving for rescue. She always tells me to send off everyone with a smile. Really? Isn't there someone who sends you off with a smile? Rescuers and those rescued both have families waiting. Okay. Haruka. Leave all your sorrows here. Yes, I will. Mom, I'm home. Haruka! Welcome back. Returning for rest duty! You look great. So do you. Is dad at school? He was made Principal? Isn't that tough? Isn't your job even tougher? Not really. Well, maybe sometimes. Commander said to take a rest. So, how long is your holidays? A couple of days. You'll be dad's drinking buddy. Abalone and sake! Dad, have one more. - Haruka, you too. - Thanks. Your dad had a great time. He's so glad that you're back. But he opposed my enlisting until the end. We were worried about you flying a helicopter. You two don't trust my flying? Come for a ride. No way! I'm scared! That's mean! I'll tidy up. Just relax. Haruka You said you'd be a helicopter pilot, like my rescuer. I was so surprised to hear you say that! And now you're too busy to take holidays. Try to come home at least once a year. Yeah. Your dad worries, too. Yeah. Slop! We're waiting for you! It's great to be back here. I'll break my back for you. But not my ribs. Try to stay in one piece! Okay, I'm sure Sena has more to share. But for now... cheers! Cheers! Thank you! Now let's eat! It looks delicious. You asked... ...what burden I'm carrying. Yeah. In the F-15, I carried the nation in the cockpit. And now, lives are in my hands. As with everyone here. I see. I'm relieved to hear that, Ex-F. Rescue Squad seems fun. Drink up! Thanks! Come and join us in rescue team. - Sorry! - Gosh. It's a good time to tell. No, don't tell them! Come on. The more happy news the better. Attention! Meiko. We're happy to welcome Sergeant Sena back, ...but I want to use this chance to announce another happy news! Private Midori Katsunuma and Captain Goichi Yokosuka are engaged! Congratulations! Captain Yokosuka, ...congratulations! Really? Congratulations. Haruka, Meiko, thank you. You're engaged? What's going on? Well... Haruka and Sena are next. Stop that! We aren't even dating yet. - We? - She said we! Congratulations. James 21, Roger. Cleared for take-off. High-rate climb until 8000.
