Homicide case at the end of the year. Police have confirmed the deceased. Chiwaki Yoshiko, 20. Nursing student. At first I had no idea. That's Chiwawa I know. Anyway, I don't even know the real name of Chiwawa. I know nothing. With Chiwawa, we have fun and talk together. Talk about your troubles, and talk about something out of the bounds. We kiss, we have sex. We have loved and hated each other. We meet with Chiwawa in the streets of Tokyo. For no reason, here it is. Right here. I said that ... listen to me. How? We have no money. Really? No money? I said no money every time. Short of money again? -I hate it and ask for money. Nah. It's because you have too little money. What? Where did you get it? You still ask me. How much does everyone give? -How much is it? How much is it? -Two thousand dollars. It's you. Isn't it enough? Well, there are relatives in my family who open a hotel in Iwate. You startled me. Hello everyone, I'm Chiwawa. Nice to meet you. What is it with that strange name? People often say that I look like Chiwawa. How tall are you? I wanted to grow taller when I was in middle school. So I drank too much milk. As a result, only the chest gets bigger. OK, don't watch. I heard that we don't grow taller when the menstruation comes too early. So, how tall are you? 155 cm, same as Mr. Bean. Is Mr. Bean short? Where did the girl come from? He chatted with me at the club. How are you willing to ignore her? He said, "Only you are different from others". What? What? Say it again. "Only you are different from others". I think… Only you are different from others. My chest? -It is big. Yo ~ What were you talking about just now? Kiki, Sayaka, look here. Look here. Wait, not just a casual look, it should be more ... Like something is behind me. I came because Nagai said he wanted to make a film. The result is not worse than before. Director, what do you want us to do? Can you please be specific? How can this be enough? Does everyone really have money? Don't talk about going abroad this way. Not enough even for one night at the hotel. Everyone is poor. In the end, although there are many places to go. There are few places that we can actually go. Otherwise, where do you want to go in the summer vacation? There are so many places to go! For example? Macau, Hawaii, Guam, Paris. Cebu Island, Phuket, Atami. Do you have a passport? -No She said no ... I hope something changes. Enough to dissolve the discomfort of passing time. Do you understand? Where you are going next? Is this where we come all the way? (Kato Miki, 5134 followers) Turn around slightly. That's it. Whether true love Money or a bright future I shouldn't get it after that. How can we endure Waiting for time to pass? If someone teach me how to do it Or simply give up, Is it better to be an adult directly? Am I annoying? So ... For example, for Miki, you What's the matter with becoming an adult? Excuse me, service Should I tell you something? What? Look over the VIP seat. That bag is worth six million. Six million inside. Six million? Aren't you too loud? Wait, how do you know? They told me just now. That group of people is engaged in construction. They'll probably give that money to politicians later. This kind of thing ... Tell us, what you want us to do? Akira Not interested? That's six million. No kidding. With six million, we can make a great summer. Otherwise ... It's up to you. Stop! Catch him. Miki Wait. Run away! The body of the deceased Chiwaki (Flash report of Tokyo Bay corpse case) (Identified dead) In sorrow, has been returned to the Hometown of Oyama, Tochigi Prefecture.

The reporter is currently with the body of Chiwaki-san which is discovered Tokyo Bay Port Area. The body of Chiwaki-san was cut into pieces. When found, each part was put in a mini-plastic bag. This is something as indescribable as the characterization of contemporary young people's lifestyle and shocked the entire generation. This case is likely to also have Potential to change the way the young people live. Homicide at Tokyo Bay We still can't find the true murderer. We should start from the dead, Chiwaki-san. What do you learn from a very short life? (Gather at Sedgwick tonight) (Let's hang out for Chiwawa) (Chiwawa, 95,000 followers) When our grandpa died She once said "I have to be a doctor". (Parents of the deceased Chiwaki Yoshiko) She has very (Chiwaki Akemi, Chiwaki Genzo) sincere eyes, they said so. We meet in high school (Yoshiko's high school friend) I feel like (Yuki Nagata) I want to talk to her more ... But I can never see her again, I can't accept it ... What about dinner? -Not eating. (Sedgwick) Because Nagai said he wanted to make a video. She was first met by a victorious man in Shibuya. And she met with everyone. Then I became familiar with everyone because of the shooting. and we often hang out afterwards. What kind of video work is it? That guy named Nagai wants to be a movie director. Although shooting It's just shooting us just for fun. (Assel Publishing, Yuko Suzuki) Where can I see these videos? (Assel Publishing, Yuko Suzuki) It doesn't seem to be finished. He continues to shoot until now. Miki, it's been a long time. -It's been a long time. You should say happy new year first. -Happy new year. What's wrong with you? This is Nagai's new camera. Yeah, what's on it? There is something to be held. Miki I miss you so much. Chiwawa's story is really scary. Have you changed your hairstyle? So cute. Are you in job search mode? -Not at all. She says no. Nagai, what about Yoshida? I do not know. Katsuo said he would come over after part time job. I want a glass of Yuzu tonic. OK Shima, lend me your iPod. Here. -Thank you. At least for today, let's play some songs that Chiwawa likes. Didn't Chiwawa come a while ago? No Your group hasn't been here for a long time. After all, people have been meeting less recently. Here -Thank you. Yumi seems to meet Chiwawa often. Where is Yumi? She keeps crying inside. Harada accompanied Saeko to comfort her. After all, Yumi is closest to Chiwawa. She said that TV and the Internet are lying. She feels pitiful to Chiwawa. Just now, she broke up with Akira. Akira has been fooling around with suspicious people recently. Yumi Are you OK? This is bad… It sounds like Chiwawa deserves to be killed. How could those guys not understand? Chiwawa is always so desperate. That talk show this morning ... Think about it, in a modern era with too many options. Living in a leading city This is a subject Toyed by diversity, The typical tragedy of Tokyo. I really want to kill that guy. Although I also want to kill the murderer. These guys will only say stupid things so I want to kill them too. No more Chiwawa ... She still has a lot to do but… But when she is dead, she can do nothing. (Sedgwick) Katsuo Yes The guests never leave. -You have worked hard. Did you gather for Chiwawa? We are just drinking like before. Is that so? Did you tell Yoshida? No After Chiwawa news broke, We never contacted or met. I think he is too concerned about me too. Is that so? Is that Nagai's? -Yes. I can't help looking at the previous photos. Nostalgic. Nagai ... He always loved Chiwawa. Did you notice it? It feels like Nagai doesn't look like a dating person. Yes? He seems to be in love with her through the viewfinder. I said Katsuo ... What's up? What did Chiwawa really want to do? I always felt… I suddenly wondered. What does she want to do ... Don't you think ... it's much like the gold rush? I mean our relationship with Chiwawa. Don't you think? Gold rush? My friend said so that time. Suzuki, these words Can you really write with this? It's okay. I want to know the truest story of Chiwaki-san. Although there are many reports about this case I barely saw Affirming the identity of Chiwaki-san as a fashion model And mourn for her. After all, Chiwawa also have a lot of fans ... But why did you find me? Our magazine, so far, we have interviewed Chiwaki-san several times. She said she was under the influence of her friend Miki Started to be a model. No, I ... Upload photos just as a hobby. Young people Almost all started as a hobby, right? But I'm different from Chiwawa. It will never be step up from being a hobby. At first She is Yoshida's new girlfriend. She appeared before us. Chiwawa You know… Can I go to bed with Yoshida? Don't worry about me anymore. I know. I fell in love with Yoshida somehow. But it hasn't been smooth. and Chiwawa appeared and so I was very envious of Chiwawa being Yoshida's girlfriend. But I seem to understand why. What do you mean? Chiwawa is persuasive. Makes me feel that Yoshida's girlfriend should be such a girl like Chiwawa. Chiwawa, change hands! Katsuo Yoshida! Yoshida! Hello Katsuo, where are you? Well, now that ... Yoshida's new girlfriend ... I'm with Chiwawa. Understand, just do it. I see, then. Yes. What are you doing? Here I split it in two. Why? This way, no matter which one of us is caught, we are left with at least three million. This morning, Representative director of the construction company of Morisube Kaguya Hirori and three of his staff are arrested (Morisube Construction Company Bribery Case) For bribery. (Three staffs arrested) Suspected of bribery I am Chiwawa. You still have the money yesterday? Can I say a word? Generally speaking… This money… Is it ours? Chiwawa, good job! Now we can go anywhere we want! But even for domestic At least there are things like Okinawa, right? But Yoshida said he wanted to go here. How? Are you familiar? But Kiki I heard the boys from the midland are very strong. Really? Then let Kiki and Sayaka go. This is pretty good. You want to be dissatisfied, right? What is this? Yoshida, you are the worst. This is sexual harassment. Stop bullying Yoshida, Nagai, Nagai. Thank you. Nagai You guys, it's so cold outside. You are noisy. In order to hide true feelings, I always hold a camera. Are you really a cold-hearted genius? Let me say, Nagai... The girl you want to shoot. Is she really the one you want? What? May be because of some desire, do you pick up the camera? I feel something. How do you choose your subject? Although everyone wants to go abroad, most importantly, Chiwawa has no passport. If such a great time lasts, I feel like I have nothing to fear, Chiwawa at that time ... really cute and dazzling. Thinking back ... That actually was a suicide attack on our youth. Don't you think Yoshida has changed? He no longer yells or orders around. and becomes active. Yes indeed... Don't you think Miki? What? Why ask me? It's 100% Chiwawa's influence. Yoshida is very gentle from the beginning. Where is he gentle? If I spend extra time preparing to go out, He will wait for me silently. I will go down first. Chiwawa will be going down too. Miki, are you happy? What? This is all our effort, right? It's your effort, right? Because we were not caught at that time, Everyone can enjoy it now. So Miki should enjoy more. Yoshida? Chiwawa! Chiwawa! Are you OK? Strange, can't Chiwawa swim? Let's go back. We thought six million would never be spent entirely. but we spent all in three days. Don't let go, Chiwawa will drown. You really can't swim? Yes You are too much, Yumi. Sorry sorry Don't let go. Well, I know. Chiwawa is so warm. Really? Yes, you are warm. Say it more. Chiwawa is so warm, Chiwawa is so warm. Chiwawa are so warm ... Only you are different from others. I have transformed to a flower. Does Miki always take pictures here? Nagai secretly let us use outside business hours. Yes. Miki is really cool. So cute, right? Miki has been so cute. Miki should have a lot of fans, right? She has more than 5,000 followers. Then if Miki orders it, Can she gather 5,000 people? I don't know that though. -No? No Have you not used, Chiwawa? Instagram or Facebook or something? I didn't use them, too complicated. You didn't use? Too complicated? Come on, I will set up an Instagram account for you. Now? Right now, lend me your phone. Why didn't you do it before? -What are you doing? -I didn't expect to do these things. What are you doing? I'm helping Chiwawa to get an Instagram account. Chiwawa is going to be online. What name do you want to use? Chiwawa Instagram is boring, I advise you not to use it. You obviously use it yourself. Just call Chiwawa. -Is just Chiwawa okay? Is there anything I can set as a profile picture? I have some photos but they are not cute. No no, they are definitely cute. But Chiwawa haven't taken photos in such places. How about this one? -I don't like that one. Don't you like it? Obviously cute. Hey Then ask Nagai to help you. Right? Nagai? Nice ...to ....meet ...you.... I ..am ...Chiwawa Kiki, look. I uploaded. You uploaded successfully? That's nice. Miki has been doing such cute things. It's just hobby, just hobby. Let me upload many photos of myself. I follow you, Miki. I will follow you too. Miki Yoshida seems to hate me. He seems to feel tired of me. That's all I did for her. After that, Chiwaki-san started working as a model. Chiwawa is different from me, she has talent. What talent? From the point of view that I can only take this as a hobby in the end, She is rising at an incredible speed. It's incredible, look. -What? Naomi reshared a picture of Chiwawa. Incredible. Very incredible, right? How did it happen? Chiwawa gets popular on Instagram. After reposted immediately by popular model Naomi. she got awareness in one breath. Everyone's getting so high Losing their minds And I'm looking for you Don't even know (60,000 followers) What I'm doing here (Chiwaki) Why won't you just tell me? (Affiliated model, Chiwawa) 'Cause I'd rather be lonely Your heart is so heavy Your heart is strange You wanna love me But honey, that ain't okay You're not so heavenly And I'm not sure that you're for me But in the morning, it might just change Oh, baby, won't you stop it? You and I haven't got it Television romance Oh, baby, won't you stop it? You and I haven't got it Television romance Do you think you can have me tonight I think that my, think my heart is alright And oh baby think that I've got all the time But in a few hours I'll be out of my mind Oh, baby, won't you stop it? You and I haven't got it Television romance Oh, baby, won't you stop it? You and I haven't got it Television romance Oh, baby, won't you stop it? You and I haven't got it Television romance Oh, baby, won't you stop it? You and I haven't got it Television romance Television romance Television romance Oh, baby, won't you stop it? You and I haven't got it Television Romance That way Chiwawa becomes our main character. If this makes you uncomfortable, I apologize first. Miki, you more or less have something about Chiwaki-san. be it jealousy or worship. I'm going to be a big name someday. At that time, Chiwawa will invite everyone to eat shabu-shabu. I like her very much. I like Chiwawa very much. Thanks for the hospitality. -Don't mention it. I have many things to ask. Could you please take the time to talk to me like this again? OK Thank you Must I be alone next time? This… It's not like this. Who do you want to come with? (Yoshida) (Dialing) Your call is unavailable now ... This is what Katsuo told me. I can't contact Yoshida at all. Is that so? I don't know what he is doing. I ... look at the women with Yoshida all the time Chiwawa feels the best match with him. Chiwawa's cooking is surprisingly good. Not the kind of spaghetti that hot girls would make. But Japanese stew and things like that. When Grandpa is hospitalized, My mom is in the hospital to take care of him, Since my dad hates eating fast-food, I cook at home. After all, my brother is the kind of person who does nothing. If Chiwawa doesn't dump Yoshida, Maybe things won't be like this. Didn't Yoshida dump Chiwawa? It's not. It was Chiwawa who goes out to date with other men. I was dumped by Yoshida. What? Why? What happened? Chiwawa Listen to me, that guy lives with other women. He is crazy. What does this mean? Yoshida is that kind of person, after all. I believed without thinking too much. This is what Shima told me. Chiwawa and Yoshida It's not who dump who... But they both came to a conclusion. Here -Thank you. Who is Yoshida to Chiwawa? How do you know this? Chiwawa has been forced to desperation she is crying and called me. Saying "What am I doing wrong?" "Where did I do wrong?" She always repeat these words. Think about it, Chiwawa also makes some money. But Yoshida was still a student. And still getting money from home. So this part ... it's a bit uncomfortable. But after they broke up. There are new dates for both parties right away. This is what Nagai told me. It's Sakata, Sakata. Sakata? Sakata Joe The photographer who often shoots in our studio. This photo of Chiwawa looks great. This is also taken by Sakata. He keeps talking when taking pictures. Many models don't like him. But his photos are still great. Chiwawa just signed with an agency. When she started working hard, Sakata filmed her immediately because of the magazine Came to our studio. It's different from you. She was taken during business hours. One more time? Nagai I'm going now. Cute? -Yes Good morning Are you ready? -Yes Are you Chiwawa? I am Chiwawa I am Joe. Sakata Joe. All ... set up Let's start You're okay like this alone because you're cute. To stand in front of my camera like this. Ten years later, twenty years later What will you be doing? What? You probably don't think about it. This ... is not just modeling. I want to be an actress too. Also it is unlikely but I also want to build my own brand. Strange, I don't know ... How old are you now? -19 years Then surely many things are unclear. Do you know that you are young? I know. One day you will no longer be young. Everyone said that. What do you want to say? I often have a lot to say, But it seems I shouldn't say to you. Do you have any special person? Have you been cherished? Chiwawa ... -How about Chiwawa? Does Chiwawa have a lot of love? Close your eyes Faster At Chiwawa's side There are always many people gathered, so you are not lonely. But are those guys really OK? They know nothing. Isn't only Chiwawa the one who work hard? Sit down As long as others talk nicely to you, You just wag your tail like a dog happily, right? Don't you think this is bad? In the end, It's just you who are hurt and lonely. Do you understand? You actually noticed it. then you… are willing to love me? I finished shooting. You have worked hard, thank you. What is it? Isn't it too much? This ... I think it's too much. I want to punch Sakata. but… After shooting, When I was worried about Chiwawa and went to the lounge to find her. I felt… That's beyond my comprehension. It makes me feel stupid. Although I don't know if this is the tipping point, But after that Chiwawa broke up with Yoshida and went to Sakata's side. Nagai you ... Sorry, nothing -What's the matter? Chiwawa and Sakata's love text. Do you love me? Do you love me? I love you. I love you. Love me more than anything? Love you more than anything. Love me more than the whole universe? Love you more than the whole universe. Do you think I'm stupid? No, I don't think you are stupid. Do you think I'm boring? You are fun and interesting. Do you like my eyelids? I like your eyelids. Do you like my lips? I like your lips. Do you like to smell me? Of course, you are fragrant. Really? Do you like me? like me very much? love me the most? I like you. I like you very much. I love you the most. Really, like likes like me the most? Love me so much? Really, like like you the most, love you so much. Anyway, it's enough now. You only have to say that to me now. You really like like me the most, Love me so much? Enough Good night. Chiwawa. Now, really? Is that true? Really. So annoying. Be careful I break your neck. There is nothing I can do about it. You have no chance at all compared with Sakata. Annoying But Chiwawa is really about money Yoshida is so pitiful. Nagai? Nagai Do you want to dance? Yes. Turn around Beautiful Chiwawa Hey It's me jumping with Chiwawa. Who are you? Sorry, his name is Nagai, and he's my friend. He was in the studio when you took the first photo for me ... What? ... -Get off. Get off You should get off ... -Get off Shut up Get off. Nagai, sorry ... Sorry No, sorry Don't mind. Chiwawa was really taken by that guy. Then you can take Chiwawa again. What the hell. Chiwawa Let's make a movie together. What did you say? Let's make a movie together! Is it strange? No Alright Really? Alright Really? Great! Great! Successful! We are going to make a movie! We are making a movie! Did you really shoot? That guy worked very hard later. He want to show off to Chiwawa. But somehow he couldn't reach her. In the end, it was still a mess. Here -What do you mean? I remember now. Chiwawa later broke up with Sakata. Isn't half a year since then? Half a year? Chiwawa had nowhere to live for a while. Take turns living our friends' houses. That's what friends who kept her said at the time. What did you say? Apart from seeing Chiwawa in the streets and mobile phones. You can also see Chiwawa when you go home. that it is interesting. Also at my house, she lived for about two weeks. This is my story. Miki, thank you. My room is really small. Don't say that. Excuse me. Miki's house really beautiful. Why are you lying? The room is here. Chiwawa, it's okay, mom will wipe it later. I'm too short to wipe. Let me take it for you -OK Good morning. Good morning, Miki. Chiwawa got up early and helped me clean. Ain't I amazing? Amazing Chiwawa lived in my house for two weeks. And help with the shop, making my mother happy. It was surprisingly good to have her at home. You don't even wear clothes to sleep? After all, it's a mess, I'm wearing at least underwear. Isn't it cold? Miki What? Everyone is not gathering recently. Yes Summer was obviously so enjoyable. I was thinking ... We all had such a happy time together. We will definitely be together forever after. But when this idea emerges, we definitely will not meet again in the future. Do you see Chiwaki-san afterwards? That should be the last time. Then again, aren't you taking someone else here? Sorry, I can't reach him. Can I ask who the other party is? That one… The person we met when we met Chiwawa Is it ... Yoshida? Yes This is what Harada told me. I Meet Chiwawa for the first time. It was at club. Right ... You did. We haven't contacted since then. But when I came to Tokyo, I only knew her. so when I contact her She said she was homeless now. Then she came to my house. How long has Chiwawa lived in your house? About two or three months. But at first I thought, She will only live for a day or two. So I let her sleep on the bed, I sleep on the sofa. but… On the third day, she came to me ... So from that day ... From that day? It's been a mess. but I feel more and more unbearable. Chiwawa disappeared for a while. I think we are insignificant to each other. so we dare to try everything. Like, I can't do that with Sayoko. It is really… What happened during that period? This can't be said to Sayoko, OK? -I won't tell her. Miki Why do you ask everyone about Chiwawa? Am I really weird like this? But it feels like, now, It is necessary to understand what everyone thinks about Chiwawa. Although I don't know who discovered it first, In short, Nagai's situation is... While watching porn... He stumbled upon. (Charming carcass of active celebrities) (Every time I try it all) (Nagahama Yuzuki) Kiki A DVD borrowed from her boyfriend who accidentally reunited with her Hi everyone, this is Nagahama Yuzuki. One third if you have girlfriend A quarter if you have a wife Please inject love into Yuzuki. This is what Kiki told me. Anyone would be surprised. I thought it was just ordinary porn. It turned out to be Chiwawa. And also changed its name to Nagahama Yuzuki. Did you say you went to her house to find her? Yes indeed. I can't reach her if I call her. One day she suddenly contacted me and said she moved. she want me to come play with her. After I went there, it was a mansion. I still have photos from that time. There is it. This cheongsam was given to me by Chiwawa that day. She gave it to you? -Yes indeed. And Chiwawa made super delicious chestnut rice for us. My ex-boyfriend eats like a fool I'm full on the return trip. The mansion where Kiki went. It's not just Chiwawa who live there. But a house rented by her agency. It seems there are several other girls living together. Have you been to there Shima? -How could that be? Chiwawa told me. Although I didn't listen very carefully. But it's pretty much like a women's concentration camp. Anyway, that's it. She used to call me then. But she can't stand them. The inexplicable mansion they live in together. She stayed in my house for a while. Has Chiwawa ever lived in your house? OK, try it. Let me try. I don't know if it's okay. -No problem Great! Now, for you, Katsuo What is the difference between men and women? Let me see… Men and I will soon share values. And women ... A sense of distance will soon be shared. You speak so esoterically. How about you? I have to worry a lot with girls. Although it is easy to get along with boys, it is also very tiring. How long has she stayed at your house? How long has she been ... She suddenly disappeared. I was worried... But suddenly I couldn't reach her again. I saw her later.... should be a club in Roppongi. One know just by the look that the ones together with are not good. Still she is enjoying I wanted to talk to her But I think it's wrong. When I think carefully, That should be the last time I saw Chiwawa. This is what Yumi told me. Chiwawa always says. She must try to live independently. She also said she wanted to travel. So we agreed to save money together. to go abroad and play together. But she and Katsuo seem to be in dispute over money. She started to contact me to borrow money. And one time is 100,000, 200,000. I was in good condition with Akira at that time. Because I have a good life, I failed to understand Chiwawa's situation. I don't understand why she borrow money from friends. But think about it. Maybe she's asking for help because I'm a friend. This is what Akira told me. Because Yumi looks painful. Even Chiwawa That's almost a blackmail. So I called her out and told her. What do you say? I told her not to contact Yumi again. I said Yumi really hated it. I don't know, maybe I said something even more extreme. But she said ... "I see, sorry". Suddenly apologized and left. But since that day She didn't seem to contact her anymore. Anyway ... Is Yumi downstairs? Yes Let me go first. Aren't you meeting her? No need to meet my ex-girlfriend. Right. Goodbye (Sedgwick) This is what Sayoko told me. Chiwawa also came to me to borrow money. Did she find you? Yes, she wants me to lend her 100,000. But I'm not that familiar with Chiwawa. And she and Harada made me feel uncomfortable. So I immediately refused. I found out later that she said Harada played with her. And she plans to ask Harada for 500,000. I am super mad. When I saw her later, I rushed up and kicked her. Really? Lie to you. Call someone to stop them. but… Chiwawa at that time.... Seems to be weak. but… Chiwawa is dead ... I can't say bad things about the dead. 7:15 pm on the evening of the 31st Multiple large-scale explosions occurred simultaneously. Details are unknown. CCN TV took it Explosion in Singapore's harbour area. Haze in the street ... What? What happened? Since multiple bombings were occurred at the same time, (Serial bombings in Singapore) Presumably a terrorist attack. Police are clarifying the situation. Repeat once, according to CCN TV information. Singapore harbour area At 7:15 PM on the 31st Japan time, Multiple large-scale explosions occurred at the same time ... (Yoshida) Yoshida? Excuse me Yes I bought something. Thanks How about leaving it? -OK Excuse me (Application resume) Did you see yesterday's news? It's bad. Yeah, it's scary. That ... sorry, are you busy? No I'm sorry this is the case. Can you tie me? What time is the interview? Still much time left. OK, thanks. I didn't expect you to start looking for a job. Everyone has a job. Everyone can't reach you, they are so worried Katsuo, they also worry about whether you are very depressed. Why should I be depressed? Because ... after all that happened to Chiwawa. Chiwawa Really sorrowful. That's it? What? Just ... Is this your only response to Chiwawa? Can't it? It's not impossible, it's just ... After all, what are you doing here? I said it was because I was worried about you. Anything else? and also I wonder if you know other things about Chiwawa. Aren't I lying? I always lie, why? You ask about Chiwawa like this everywhere. You ask around, right? No, you say ... It's too bad. -Isn't it? Do you still like me? Chiwawa said that when we were dating. You see my eyes different from others. Are you lying? Sorry I seem to have misunderstood a lot of things. Ask me about Chiwawa. Aren't you here to ask about Chiwawa? Nevermind Stop No, wait ... I do not want… stop When Chiwawa died ... I want to be in white lilac ... Or died under hydrangea. I hate big lilies ... Or roses. I like small flowers clustered together. Got it. If you die, I'll fill your coffin with tiny flowers. You can't let go of me. Stay with me forever. I promise you. then Chiwawa disappeared in the past. Come back to here, no one cares about Chiwawa anymore. They didn't catch the killer. Our gathering place, Sedgwick. It seems to be closing at the end of this month. I thought we contributed a lot to this store. But it seems not enough. (Major terrorist attack in the capital Trieste) (320 deaths) In the end, that report about Chiwawa... Although being talked so much... The result was just a flat collection. (Never forget, SayonarChiwawa chan) The world's perception of Chiwawa remains the same. however I can still find such posts occasionally.
