You and I are not bros. -I said buddies. -No, I don't like you. You are a waste of time. Well, what about the sign on my door? It says 'storage'. It's obviously a laboratory. Can we get that changed? Talk to Dr. Lopez. Dr. Lopez, okay. Aces. Hey, Mike. Want to go to lunch sometime? No! It's going to work. I know it's going to work. No! Is that a Spectrometer 4000? Get out of dodge! How come I don't have one of these things? I could get so much more work done. Unbelievable. Hey. They had rabbits in here. Definitely here. This one was pregnant. Oh! Hello? Is someone down there?

Oh, I wonder how old you are now? I'm sure you're... Let go! Let go! I'm your friend! I'm your friend! Let go of me! Oh. Peter Cotton. Was a special kid, he was. A little nerdy, though. Just like his father, James Cotton. Now he's a lab rat. Tested feminine products on furry little animals. Put lady lips on monkey feet. It was a called a respectable job back in the atomic age. Such a wannabee, hippity, happy family they were. Little Peter's story starts back in the 10th grade when his best friend was murdered! Peter. Very good job this year. -I expected no less. -Thank you, Principal Myers. Excellent. -Hey, dork. -Ow! You looking at my girl? Uh, what? No. No, Jake. I was just-- You know, Petey. Ever since you moved to Easter Falls, you've bene a real cheese eater. Yeah, cheese eater. -Jake, leave the kid alone. Shut up, and don't talk until after I talk to you. -Oh, don't touch him! -Hey, you heard him. You got some balls, or what, kid? Ow! This damn rabbit bit my finger! Thomas, Larry, grab this dork. Hey, Jake. Come on, let's just go. It'll be fine, okay? Ain't nobody talking to you. Hey, come on. Don't do that to her! Oh, no! Jake, don't hurt him! -He's a harmless animal. -Harmless? Mandy, is this thing harmless? -Uh-uh. -Oh, man! I can see the bone! This, this thing is a dangerous animal. It's a monster. And you know what we do to monsters in Easter Falls? -Do you? -No. We kill monsters. -No, please. -A monster. -Kill the monster. -Please, man. Come on. Kill the monster. Kill the monster.

Now, it's my turn. Jesus, I'm so excited to tell them right now. I'm so excited. It's my turn to give back to you. With a brand new chapel and outreach center that god is building in my hometown of Easter Falls! - Hallelujah. - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah. - Hallelujah! Whoop! Praise Jesus. - Praise Jesus. - Now, to quote Jesus, we're going to replace the old with the new. Ten thousand square feet of Holiness. Now with your donations coming in, we will break ground this Easter weekend with a special Sunday devotional. Now, I got to get a little bit serious here. Now, your donations, they're pouring in, and we're grateful, god loves you. But god needs more money. God is knocking. Are you going to deny god? Or are you going to open your heart and open your wallet, and help all of god's little children? Come here, Cameron. Please help us, -so god blesses all of you. -Oh, come on! Poop. Oh, come on! Stupid pizza! ...is just a phone call away. -Hallelujah! -Hallelujah! Whoop! I'm excited. Are you excited? Ginger? Ginger! Ginger? Ginger, hey. I'm so sorry. Spazzy asshole's one-room crap hole. -Peter? -Hello? - Uh, hey. -Anna? Pete, I'm sorry to call you so late, but I'm in town tomorrow. Would you care for a coffee? Um. Yes, yes! I mean, sure. I mean, maybe. I have a-- If you're busy, you know-- No, no, no, no. I mean, I am. I'm working, but, uh, I'll move things around. Anything for you, Anna. Okay. So Harlow's Caf√©? Nine? Harlow's, nine, uh, I will be there or be square. Okay, bye. Hey, it was really great to hear your voice. Oh, my god. It is so good. Stupid reunions. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Shit! Operator. Hello, US army, please. Happen to have the number? No, I don't have the number! -Please hold. -Thank you. -United States army. -Hello, yes. This is Dr. Stanley from lab 6516. You're going to need to send help. What kind of help you looking for, son? Send everyone. So what I was saying is that Safran's son is a direct manifestation of Hamlet in terms of plot and character structure. So what did you do before enlisting? English professor. -Tenure? -I got laid off. That figures. What was that? Let's check this out. -Are you sure? -It's our job. Come on. Alright. What the hell happened in here? The cage is open. The cages are damaged. They're probably still in here. Might be hurt. You okay in there? There's something in here! Come out, little rabbit. Get back in your cage. - Holy shit! Hey. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! This is General Phelps. I want a two-mile radius. Nothing gets in or out but authorized personnel. Start the slaughter. Can I get you anything? More agua, granny! I'm Gobi Desert parched! What's wrong with you? I mean, I'm so sorry. Just some more water. Oh, Anna! Hey! Anna! Hi, Peter. You just are--I mean, wow! -How are you? -Uh, -I can't believe I'm seeing you. -Yeah. -I got you coffee. -Oh, thank you! Yeah, I'm just drinking water because I'm just really thirsty right now. I got you some eggs and toast. No bacon because we don't want to harm our little hoof friends. Thank you. And radishes! I need radishes! You okay? Yes. I've just been under a lot of pressure with this job that I'm doing. Working, like 20-hour days, you know? What project? Well, I can't really talk about it because it's top secret. -How's Darla? -That filthy whore! She was working at a retail store. She got together with the manager of it. And she left me. So we're not together any more. I'm sorry. That's heinous. It happens. It was really nice of you to come all this way. Um, well, actually, I'm just here because of, you know, Jake Mulligan's outreach center he's building in Easter Falls. You still talk to him? No. We got divorced. I hate him! He's trying to demolish my grandfather's church and turn it into this new studio for his ministry. That is crazy! I mean, that church has been there forever. -Since before the town even! -I know! And it was granted historical status, but he bribed someone at the registrar's office, and they changed the date that they said it was built. Such a flaming douche! So the reunion is tonight. Yeah, I hope the entire gym collapses on them. Unless you're there. If you're there, I don't want that to happen. No, you have to go with me. To Easter Falls High? Yes! -No. -Yes! -I can't. -You have to! I cannot do that. He killed my best friend. My only friend. But that's all the more reason why we have to sneak into the registrar's office while everyone is at the reunion and prove that Jake is a fraud! I need you to be my wingman. Your wingman? I've never been a wingman. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hello? My stomach hurts now. I need to hit the toilet for a moment. If you don't mind, I, uh, um... -Are you okay? -I will be! What the heck is that? I've never seen anything like it! What on earth is wrong with me? -Hey, want some crabs? -Oh, shit! I got these from the kitchen. I'm not talking about the kind you eat either! Oh, god! I must be losing my mind! I got to get out of here! Hey. Um, sorry. Uh, I really, really, really, got to get back to the lab. Something very important came up. I'm going to have to go. But will you come tonight? I mean, this kind of scandal will crush a man of god. Oh, yes. I will. -Anything for you. -I'll see you at seven. Oh, oh, oh, yes. You'll see me. I'll be there. I'll at the thingy to do the thingy. Oh! Oh, bananas. What do I do? What's happening to me? Okay. Holy Moses. That came out of me? Impossible. Peter Cocken? -It's Cotton. -Whatever. I need you to get with the gettin' while the gettin's good. I'd get with that, sir, if I knew what that meant. Means move this ward down Victory Road. Oh, Victory Road. Is that in this neighborhood? I've never heard of it. I need your god damn serum, son. Oh, the serum. Uh... But there's some problems with that. I would suggest not. And why not? May I ask the general, sir, why's he's interested in fertility serum? =Do you know who I am? -General Phelps. Which makes the mother fucker that don't have to disclose shit to you about why I want something other than the fact that I want it. And you will get shit done, 'cause I'm also the mother fucker that if I tell your mother fucking ass to jump, your mother fucking ass better be spring loaded, ready to jump off the mother fucking building! Yes, sir, General Dingle Dorf. You really don't dick around with me, son. I'll cut your balls off, stuff them up both nostrils and make you eat shit while I'm doing it. Oh, that's disgusting. News update! -We're going dark -Dark? Dark. No on in or out until Project MR is complete. General, I don't have any projects called MR. And you! -Cocken. -Cotton. Whatever. I'd like to try some of that serum. Oh, uh, I have to warn you some of my test subjects had erections for more than two weeks after multiple stimulations. You played with rabbit dick? Um... -Yes, sir. -You're sick. My jet fuel. Uh... Your jet fuel, sir. Your jet fuel. Good. Very good. -Uh, Dr. Lopez? I-- -Not now, Peter. Later. Later, Peter. Later! Later. Peter, later! General! What are these? Oh, oh! So sharp! Nightmare rabbit! Oh, I feel the mother-load. I'm not going to make it! I'm not going to make it! I'm not going to make it! There she blows! Oh, bogus! I can't take it. Somebody help! Oh! Whiskery, isn't it? Oh, my back! Oh, what do you care? You're spineless anyway. You don't stop me now. It's rabbit time! Stop whimpering you little wussy! The ladies are going to love this! I got to get to the lab! Lopez, researching rabbits so that people can screw longer? Hell... no. But... Still donkey dick. I couldn't agree more. Hit the lights. My god. Mike! That's Mike! I don't want to kill your assistant, Lopez. The way I see it, everyone should do their duty for god and country. Amen to that. We outfitted the MR with a brain manipulation device. -That's impossible. -Hardly. Start the test. America the beautiful. Major, find out how to make more of these things ASAP. Yes, sir. Oh, boy. I really am a genius. Now, if you all excuse me, I have a date with destiny. Please get out of my head! It's my head now! ‚ô™ Talking 'bout Jesus ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Oh, Jesus ‚ô™ Hi.

And this time, my rocket's going to blast off. Look at that. Guaranteed to last for hours. Maybe even days. No, no, no, no! I'll have you pounded for everything you've done here. This is the work of a mad man! You have no idea what I've done here! And now using the mind control device, I can increase the MR's homicidal tendencies by 200 percent! 'Cause I am a genius! Shit! No, no, no, no! No! Shit! Shit! Shit! Smooth move. Smooth move, genius! Sound the alarm! Daddy's home.

That's why guys like me loath guys like you. -Please stop! -We get all the hot bitches, and you go home to jack off rabbits to fantasy island. I like fantasy island! Say goodbye to your little friend. No! Go back to your lab. I got a mess to clean up. This is General Phelps. Where the hell is Major Donald? Bunny strong! -Bunny! -What the fuck? Feels like choking the chicken, doesn't it, General Dingle Dorf, huh? That's what I call getting some head! Oh! Oh, look at that. Oh, how sad! Another "fallen soldier." Wait. I smell a wilting rose. Looks like your destiny is my destiny now! Help. Help! Who am I? Well, I am your new honey bunny. The general has gone AWOL, and he left me in charge. Really? It's that small? Um, perhaps we need a snake charmer. It does resemble two blueberries right now. Let's do it bunny style. Flip over like a pancake! That was only round one! Ding, ding! Round two! Of course, I remember you. Really? No. I mean, are you sure you went to this school? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Watch your head, Ted. This ought to liven things up, don't you think? You'll never get away with this. Well, it looks like I already did. My grandfather's church is a historical monument! Well, now. It's not on the registry, is it? You made Ted change those records. He would do anything for you! Now, Ted is a loyal follower, that's true. But he would never do such a thing. Anna? Looking good. -Wow! -Hey, Thomas. Be cool. -Show the lady some respect. -Jake! Oh, Jake! This party sucks. I just spiked the punch, so things should be kicking in any minute. Oh, gag me with a spoon. Oh, hey, Anna. Good to see you're still looking about 12. Better than 50. Anyways. -Oh, now. That's naughty. -Right? Cut that out. Alright. We'll see you later, Anna. Jake, I'm going to stop you. My grandfather's church will not fall. Ain't no one going to stop my empire. Go on, get in the way, and they'll all be talking about the lake. What lake? The lake they found your dead body in. See ya. Peter, where are you? Channel 69 finally knocked you out, did it? That's what happens when you put a light weight up with this heavy weight. Who's here to save you? Hallelujah! Praise the lord! Hello, I'm Pastor Jake of Mulligan Ministries. You know, I'd like to do right now is get personal with you if that's okay. Why don't we bring it in? Who the hell is this? Are you feeling alone? Are you feeling like you want to get out of here, or escape? Retain your inner monster? I know how you feel-- My nemesis is on the premises! Let me exorcise the demons from your flesh. All you got to do is pick up the phone right now. Just pick up that phone and call-- I guess Easter Falls is calling after all. It's okay if you want to cry. Camouflage, perfect. They'll never see me in this. - Oh, darn fingernails. Oh. Going to need a pedicure. Ugh, I'm late. I'm late for a very important date. Got to get off, toots. Nothing like a smoke. I feel like a million bucks. I want to go spin myself. Someone's coming up the elevator. Dean, join two. You stay here. Happy to. No wonder that moron Peter always took the stairs. This darn thing takes forever. They should put on some decent elevator music. This is pitiful! Finally! Freeze! Oh. I don't assume you got any pharmacy around here. -Shut up! -Oh, I'm surrounded by a bunch of dipsticks. What are you? Well, I am like holiday session. But for you ignorant humans, that means that I am a rabbit man. I mean, not like a rabbit man, but a rabbit man! Shut up and come out with your hands up! Raise my hands? Oh, we're raising the roof, huh? I do like to boogie! And in fact, my favorite thing to do is... Does big baby want a bottle? Anyone else? Anyone? Told you! You're are so awesome, Rotten tail. What the hell was that? Yeah, no. I thought I'd be home by now. That's okay. Just put my dinner in the fridge and I'll warm it up. Okay, okay. I'll see you when I get home. I love you, too. Yeah, have a glass of wine. Do that, too. I gotta go! Get on the horn. I want everybody on the horn. Hello? That's right. Get 'em out here. Everybody. Everybody. Oh, she's a naughty girl! -Hey. -What? What are you going to do about that bitch, Anna? Look, she files a complaint with the state. She says we're destroying a historical building. Well, you are. I need the land, dammit! It's sitting on top of the largest gold deposit in all the south-west. We're trying to build a church. Dammit! How many times have I told you? You don't listen! You do too much cocaine. Now listen to me when I tell you. Here's what we're gonna do. Remember this. Break ground discover gold -praise god! -Praise god! -Praise god! -I think you're killing her. She's all right. You all right down there? You all right? You OK? All right, it's all right. Let's get down one more time. Baptism! Baptism! So praise god, right? -Praise god. -Praise god! And we're gonna have a brand-new broadcast center. That's right! And there's no way I'm gonna relocate. to Easter Falls. This place is a shithole. Praise god. Hey, take these for the trip. Watch it. Boss? -What's up? -You need to come see this. Now. It better be important! Shit. All right, let me get my beer. I'll see you later, honey. Just stay right here! This better be good! Shit. I feel a little sick to my stomach. Throw up. Hey, ladies. Ah, come on! Get there faster on the back of a snail! Right in the eyeball. Wow. Huh? Who's that? What do you want? Huh? Oh yeah. Go round. Go on, go around me. Hey! Go around me! Jerk off! Whoa! Get rocks, soldier! Sit on it! Spin! Oh, oh, oh! Now you know. Now, come on, Ted. Didn't I tell you to get rid of that mineral survey? I can't destroy City documents! That would be lying, and lying is a sin. "Lying's a sin." Oh, sin, huh? What, and changing the date on the construction of the church? What was that? Sit down. God told us to do that when we spoke to him. What does it matter what's under the ground? Everything, Ted! Now there are agents of the devil. Demons! And they are out to destroy us. You understand me? And she is a demon! She don't look like a demon... Oh, she don't look like a demon? How do you know? You ever seen one? Huh? Oh, you never seen one? Then how do you know? I'm sorry, Pastor. Ted. We, we've been on a lot of hunting trips together haven't we? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. Why! -Are you failing me? -Uhh... -I... -What? I what? I don't know! Oh, Ted. Now that was the wrong answer. You believe in Jesus, right? Make sure you tell him I say hello. Whoo! Goddamn! Where's his head? Look at that! Get out of my way! Look it here! -It's clean gone! -Holy sh-- Whoo! Look at that! You ever seen that before? Goddamn, I've never seen that before! Whoo! -It's a magic trick! -Some pretty fucked-up shit. Hey, he knew too much. It was time for him to go. Who's gonna fucking clean this up? You're gonna clean it up. You're gonna take care of this and find a nice lake for the body. You! I want you to go get Anna and the documents. Tie her up in the basement of the church. And, oh, make sure she wears something real nice and pretty. Low-cut like there. Look here! Look at that! There's still, there's still blood coming out! Goddamn! Oh. What? Come on. Dang it! I'm out of gas! Man, I'm telling you. Sitting at the desk... reading the paper... Delta Forces run in fully loaded to the max, man. And then, boom! The elevator door pops open. This huge bunny man pops out kicks all their asses, man. I mean, he takes them down, AK47s and all. One minute he's there, one minute he's not. There is no such thing as a bunny man. -What? -It was a real bunny man, man! That is one crazy story! I wish I was there for it. It's the bunny man, man! What the fuck? Where'd everybody go? Something I said? Oh, funky. I'll show the world... what a genius I really am. Stupid Lopez. Heh! There is absolutely nothing. Yes. Stanley, I've been looking all over for you. What are you doing in the attic? Play with my toys. Waiting for electrical storms. I don't know. I just need power! Power is the key! We've accounted for all of our staff, except for Peter Cotton. Ah, he's probably dead anyway. Good riddance. It's a complete waste of space but boy, do I love this serum! Did Phelps a treat or two. I don't think so. Oh god. Kind of busy here. That dirty rotten s.o.b. was trying to steal the glory for himself! We want orders to take him out. Yes. No, no, no, no! No, no, no, I don't- I need to study him. Yeah, I mean, I need to understand what happened. So I can stabilize the... change... Or else, if we don't, you know, he might mutate beyond anyone's control... Yeah... mmm... Turn lucid and... kill everyone in his sight. You know, if I had a couple of weeks some time to study him maybe I can bring old Phelpsie back to life... Afraid that's not possible. Orders are orders. And Peter Cotton's a dead man. Or everyone else. Damn, dammit, dammit. Hey! I'm coming for you! Jakester... Wait a second. Wonder what Anna's up to. Maybe I should see her. Might be able to catch her in a g-string. Left turn! But he's been going around and lying to everyone! I know! This was never about the church. This was about gold, Mom. You look so... pretty tonight. Ohh, I'd like to eat you like a carrot. Wait! Lost a pussy, but... Lost in this fucking leotard! Fuck! You need to broaden your horizons. Uhh, could you just hold on for one sec? False alarm. It's just my asshole neighbors. OK. All right. Well, how was the reunion? Well, huh, huh... Let me tell you, it was great. Peter stood me up. Mom, no! I don't like him. I'm, I'm with Bob. Bob is my boyfriend, and he has a name. I know you hate cops. OK, Mom. Well, I'm gonna I'm gonna hit the hay. Bobby, Bobberino! If I chopped her arms and legs off and threw you in the ocean, I'd still call you Bob. Hey, baby. I gotta go.

"Please don't kill my rabbit!" It's not the Peter any more, huh? And now I am rotten to the core! Rotten! Rotten! Rottentail! What kind of people do-? -I hope you are hungry, Tommy. -No, no, no! Because I just laid these eggs myself! And these eggs! Are definitely! Not! Made of! Chocolate! Oh, my head's killing me. Oh, god, I wish a dive-bar I'll do a a half-gain right into it. Hey, pal?
