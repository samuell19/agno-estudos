I just wanted to see if you are all right. You ve been gone for a month, I'm being transferred. I wanted to see you before I go. When are you leaving? In two weeks. I'll call you. I'll be waiting. Don't forget. All right. All right? You want to go in? Do you? Let's go. I can't take it anymore. Coming home, to this pigsty... Day in day out. Slaving my life away... Damn you! I sleep with you and you make me dirty! Here's the other prize. You found your way home? Love crazv. Where were you last night? He doesn't give a damn about us... ...about his sister... Do I have to do everything myself? You got a letter. It's on the buffet. What is it? I'm being drafted. Just what we needed! What will I do for money? With a drunk and an invalid? The army... Just what we needed! Damn the day I married. Relax now. Time to sleep. Thank you, son. Boss, something's come up. They've drafted me. Drafted, eh? It will do you good, Angelo. Only the army makes you a man. I've been pleased with you and your work. I'll keep your job for you. I'd like to buy this cross. How much is it? For your girl? Take it with my blessings. It's out of order Beat it I said. Not without my wallet. I don't have it. I'll go to the police. Yeah? What will you tell them? You bum! Come in. What's happened? Don't you like it? You're a liar! Liar! Who was that man? Who? You flipped? The man who just left. I overheard you. All right. What can I do? I told you, I just crash here. He wouldn't go away. No sweat...There's no reason to be jealous. There's only you, now. You're lying! I heard you. Believe me, it's nothing. It's all in the past. But now I love you only, only you. I'll lock the door. You never know. Who else has keys? Two others. I'm going in the army myself. Soon? In a month. It would be great if we served together. We'll always be together. I just don t like this place. Money's not a problem. We'll manage. We'll have peace and quiet. I've got some money saved. That would be great... What are you doing here? Something happen No. I've got something to tell you. I want to talk to you. I think if I leave home... ..you two can move to the bedroom... ...and Nota can sleep in the living room. It'd be better for all of you. I'm not a kid anymore. Are you crazy? You're not in the army yet! You got everything at home. How will you manage? I'll make it out. What will people say, you leaving your folks? Don't you feel sorry for your mother? Your sister? All right. It's getting late. I have to get to work. I brought the bills. All right. If it's not paid, they'll cut the electricity. Hello.. Hello, sweetheart. Bravo, you've done wonders. How do you like the sheets? Great. It's small but it's all we need. The train makes noise, but it stops at night. It's just great to have you own place. It's got central heating too. I didn't buy plates yet. All in good time. I bought the wine from the little tavern... Here's to you. It'd be great if we served together in the army. It doesn't matter, we'll get together anyway. We have our own place now. You're late. I was worried. I said I'd come. - A cup of coffee? - No thanks. Well? What? You've forgotten me. But that's all right. I hear you're doing fine. Are you happy with your friend? know that.. ...you may not want me anymore... ..I accept it, I won't discuss it. But I think of you... ...and I'm still your friend... and I love you. You're part of my life. Ours is a small world. It's easy to find out about someone. And you won't like very much what I heard. Your friend is wel known. You're young. You have a lot to learn. Be careful, he's a professional. If you want me to stay, talk about something else. - It s nice where you're going? - For me it is. You can be what you are... Without being kicked out of your job. Here there's hypocrisy and contempt to put up with. You got to hide, to be cautious. You're lucky. Not really. I've been through a lot you don't know about. That's why I say, be careful. We're an easy mark, all of us. Now you 'go unnoticed. But not forever. If you ever need me I'll send you my address. I'll write. And if you ever decide to leave Greece... I'll be happy to put you up for as long as you like. I've been drafted into the army. But thanks anyway. I'd love to come. I've got to go now. This is for you to remember me. I will. Good luck. Have a nice trip. Hello, mama. Hello. How come you came by? I was nearby. What happened? I report next week. Nonsense! A soldier and you want your own place! How will you pay the rent? With the soldier's salary? We both work here and still it s not enough. And you want an apartment for an overnight pass! Be reasonable... I won't ask for money and when I can I'll give you some. I just want a place of my own. But how will you pay for it? You've got to help us too. Anyway, how do you know you'll be stationed in Athens? I've got a surprise for you. I can give presents too. Can't I? I can t imagine what you'd think of. I thought of you, sweetheart. I'm always thinking of you. Dressed that way. You'll stop traffic. That's how I'm gonna like you. You'll drive me nuts. But I can't wear these things! Don't be silly! Don't you want to please me? Don't spoil this for me. ??? Come on, you'll see... I've got plans for this little head. Don't you get it? We can make so much cash... Why should we depend on the handouts my old man gives me? Come on.. Put them on. You're late! Come on in. I thought you'd never come! What's your pleasure? What's she got that you ain't, you silly thing? Just a little make-up.. Come on... If I were you I wouldn't think twice. You'll have the best at your feet, gorgeous thing! You'll see, how jealous Mikhails will be! A great job! Every night another guy! You get a kick and make bread too! Look at me! Got a car, an apartment... If you're smart, you'll do fine! Even with that lousy lipstick, you're a doll! You'd be amazed how many straights do it in secret. Everybody does it, why should you be ashamed? Anyway, who knows you? Nobody will find out. You only go out at night. Lucky there's lots of tricks around. You're a knockout. Good luck We'll go places us two. Hold the cigarette more feminine like. Don't worry, I'll take care of them. Baby, come with me ...and I'll give you the time of your life! What do you want? To look at the goods and decide. Your wife got tits like this? She got this kind of thighs? You shouldn't fuck Wednesdays and Fridays. You trash But they know I'm not a woman. For sure, that's why they come here. They dig boys, but they hide behind our skirts. Just be sure to get the money first. What if somebody takes me for a woman? You still have a lot to offer. Cunts ain't got nothing more than you do, honey. You re new. You'll learn. Take it easy, it's our men. He's mine, take him. A piece of cake. I give him to you. Don't be afraid. And remember, money first! You gave him to her? For good luck. Remember when I used to feed you... One spoon for daddy.. "One for mama, one for me..." One for little Costakis who lived upstairs... ..and one for grandma. Take those sweets to grandma when you go... so she won't say we forgot her at Christmas. She ate already? She ate it all... .and now she's going to open her present. My beauties. You make them jealous. Who are you burying? It's master Yiannis the cripple. Stupid, drank himself to death! 20 years since she left him and he never forgot her. Let us bury him and get it over with. Get it over with? That's all you want, get it over with! As for him, serves him good. The same goes for you too. Ask your wives what you're talking about! Don't pay attention to the words of the sinner! You're a fine one to talk! You slept with everybody. Yes! I had them all... ...for fun and money But I always enjoyed it! Annie, you forget how we used to keep each other's kids when we had a client or a lover. And then, when we got worn out... and our daughters spread their legs for a cup of olive oil... You wished it was you and your dried up body trembled. And you, fat Leni... We know how your good for nothing husband paid off the car. Cuckold! Cuckold! That's what you all! Honest cuckolds! Put down the stones! Put them down, Christians! They're jealous of my roses. I know! Why do you fight, grandma? They'll hurt you. A dog's bark is worse than his bite. And then, how can they hurt me more than time did? You want coffee? I just had one. For you, my boy. What s that? Sweets, grandma. From mother. To hell with her... She was wasted. No brain! She was the best. My, my, what was that... ...when she had a man on top of her... ...the world shook! She enjoyed it more than anybody else! And then she got hung up... .with that asshole father of yours. Just because she was pregnant. As if people would give a shit if she lived or not. Damn her! She works herself to death. Shit on all of them. My grand-daughter! You like her? But you got my sister. The drunk's seed! A ghost of a girl. I wanted her to be a real woman... ...making men crazy. If you only were a girl! It would be wonderful.. I'd feel great through your body. Only you love me. Nobody else. Only you understand me. Keep in touch. We should've done something. Somebody call the men from the bar. What happened? The housewives had their husbands beat us up. You don't know anything? I was working. Haven't you heard about Jenny? She's in the hospital, all beat up. I'm gonna call the guys. I'll go too. I'm worried. There's nothing better than the 500cc. Do we talk about bikes or about shit? Less than 750cc is just a bicycle. Why don't you get a bike first... .and then talk about it! Mine stands up on one wheel for a mile. Bet I'll get both. Bet? A thousand each. I'm in. What about you? A man's got to have a bike. I'll get it. Free loaders You hang around while we get beat up! What happened? They beat up Jenny. Let's go. Danos will be there in five minutes. Oh no! It s a good bike but not the bike! What bike did Danos get? A Honda 500 You'll have a better one.. I ordered it... We'll have it in two days. The biggest! Want a drink? Really? Our women can't go out alone. The scum makes passes at them. But you can't just take the law in your hands. What can we do, Captain? Tell us what to do. Put yourself in our shoes. Do we sell our homes and leave here? The police must do something... If not, what happens to us? I understand. Cleaning up the neighborhood is a reasonable request. But if you do that again I'll have to lock you up. What if everyone started beating up these people? Go now. I don't want to see you again. Come closer, miss. I spit on you, creep! A soldier and a fag! You're a disgrace. Has he got a record? No, Captain. Put hm on file and inform the army. And send him for a physical. And listen... Let his family know. A fag! A fag! Everybody's laughing at me! Me, who kept my face clean all those years! My son a fag! My son a fag! How can I face the neighbors? Quiet now! Dirty money! Filthy money! Shameful money! I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself! Don't touch me! A fag! My son a fag! Are you crazy? I'm sorry, we could do nothing. Come... I'll go get the clothes. When their clothes are here, tell us. You should call me... ...and I'd bring your laundry at home. Leave them and I'll bring them over. We'll have a nice little talk too. What do I owe you? Three hundred. Madame is upset. Her reputation, you see! I don't want them, I hate them! I can't take it! I can't! Shut up! They all laugh at me! I was kicked out of the army. I don't have a moment of peace. I can t take it! I can't take it! I can't take it anymore! I told you, I'll take care of anyone who bothers you. I'm fed up with you and your crying. When I get out of the navy, I'm leaving. You're right. I won't make anymore scenes. I'll be good. I'm not crying anymore. I'll get ready for work. Get in, please. Can you come to my place? - It'll cost you more. - All right. But if anybody else is there, I'll leave. We'll be alone. - Want a drink? - Yes, why not. What will you have? Whisky. On the rocks? No. Thanks. How about some music? - Something to eat? - No, don't bother. It's no rouble. Can I ask you something? Do you like what you do? In the beginning I did. Not anymore. But one gets used to things. What can I do ... Are you married? Yes. They're abroad for a few days. Is this your first time? The first. - You re the best! - Not for you. - What's he saying? - Nothing, honey. - Coming, doll? - For your good looks? And for five hundred. We'll have to dump the garbage first. I'll lose other clients! It'll cost more. Let it cost! We dump at night cause of that pollution bullshit. Where are you going? I'll be back. What happened to you? You took care of me! You took care of me You took care, of me! You took care of me .
