Yep, folks. It's just another smoggy day in downtown Los Angeles, where everyone seems to have their head on straight, except for my friend Sean Reynolds. He says he's going to walk out that door with a sack full of cash. All comes down to this. He's walking toward with a bag. Why cash, you say? Because the Sasquatch dude says he doesn't take Visa. I'm just going to ruin your day. Looks like you're stuck shoot the pilot, smartass. No. Man, you don't have that much cash. That's-- Far from the only one, buddy. Who the hell did you steal that from? 7,500 of them-- and I don't mean the Canadian kind. Let's get one more shot, before we get out of here. Come on. Spin around here. Get in here with me, buddy. You wave to that camera. Say hello to all of your-- - What's happening? What's happening? --Soon-to-be adoring fans. Seven days a pit toilets to mosquitoes. I'm just elated. Darryl Coleman, you are about to embark-- Can you feel it? --On the journey of a lifetime. We're uncomfortably close, aren't we? - Mom, I'm sorry. - Let's-- let's go Come on. I never meant to go this low. Let's go. Let's go find a van. You know I don't carry equipment. Not for what you're paying me. Relax. Just pack the gear a little tighter. Make room for the rest of the stuff, huh? Here we are, folks, at Video Gear Rentals, where our producer and sound engineer have the rest of our equipment lined up. And there she is, Miss Robyn Conway, television producer and longtime friend. Man, why are you filming me? Damn, I miss working for a studio. Amateurs. It's called reality television Darryl. Get used to it. You've had 10 years. Yeah, you're right. I guess bringing your ex-girlfriend along is about as real as reality gets, so that's-- good call. Robyn is coming along because she's the best producer I've ever worked with, thank you. And she's so good on top, and under, and on the side. It's ancient history, all right? Yeah, whatever. Hey, and don't forget the fact that she believes in all that woo-woo crap that trashed your career in the first place, right? Yeah, it's perfect. She's the yin to my yang, the true believer to my skeptic, the-- Long time no see. Good to see you. Good to see you. How have you been? Good, good. I've been locked up in a feature and two commercials all back-to-back. You know it is. Gotta make that money, keep paying my 401k to the ex-wife. Yeah, well, hopefully this will be your jackpot. Yeah, maybe. We have one problem. Now what? Curtis is having second thoughts. What? Yeah. You didn't tell him. The answer is no. I love that shirt. It's an outdoorsy shirt. You don't even know what the question is. I-- I-- Curtis, I need you on this, man. Now I'm your friend, but I'm just-- What's with the cameras? The cameras are here because Sean and-- and Darryl apparently have a great project. It's a gig, dude. You record sound, you get paid. What am I missing? - What am I missing? Do you know what you're missing? Cameras? The part where you take us all out into the woods for a week. - Yeah, so? - Yeah. Who lives in the woods, Sean? Who lives in the woods, Sean? - You can't-- Say it. Say his name. Bigfoot that's who lives in the Woods. Bigfoot is a fantasy, OK? The crazy old dude that-- that the three of us are going to interview is just hoaxing us-- No, no, no, no. --With some of it made-up story about a Bigfoot body. Oh, it's a made up story about a Bigfoot body. Yeah. See, when you put it like that-- I'll pass. Look, man, the show's going to be a hit. No. - It's going to be huge. And I'll tell you what, I'll-- I'll restructure the deal, so that you get taken care of on the back end, as well. Points. Would you talk some sense into him? I don't know what else to say, but-- He's not talking straight. That's your friend. Just remember, you guys don't have benefits or life insurance. Really, Latonya? That's a really good point. Life insurance? Really good point. Life-- what are you laughing at? Curtis, just slow down. - Sean, no. - Hear me out. You're not thinking straight. - Leave me alone. The van leaves in 10 minutes. I need you in it. I don't care. Move, Kevin. I need you in the van with-- excuse me-- with me. God. You, me, Darryl, Robyn, back together again. How can I put this to you? You are shooting a horror show. And no black man in his right mind is going out into the woods with a bunch of white folks-- no disrespect-- for a horror-- Latonya-- - Curtis. Latonya, come here please. Come here. Thank you. What now? Just-- please, for a second. I know you get confused sometimes. Someone like you might not understand, but let me explain it, OK? Look at us. We are light-skinned, but we're still black. We're not white. We're not going camping. We're not going to roast marshmallows, and we sure as hell are not chasing Bigfoot in the forest, Sean. None of the above. None. I have never done a show without you. I understand. I can't do this show without you. - That's not true. - Sounds like you, Curtis. I need you on this one, buddy. You need me? Yes. No, no, no. You know what you need? You know what you need? You need a sound guy who's dumb enough to get a Bigfoot broke off in his ass, and I don't just the guy for you. Come here. Kevin, Kevin is your man. Huh? What? Aw, that's adorable. He smells. Oh, no. Seriously. At the next stop, can we switch please? Well, it was a bit of a rough start, but ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to announce we are now officially on our way out of Los Angeles and on track to arrive in northern California later this afternoon. Much later. We each get to shoot our own stuff, how cool is that? Hey, Sean, you do know how dangerous this is, don't you? Every producer's secret dream is to be a cameraman. Then go crazy. I want at least one of you guys shooting at all times. Darryl's going to shoot the main stuff. He'll shoot the-- the interviews, the establishing shots, of course, the unveiling. But you guys, for filler and for confessionals, I want you shooting at all times. Burn those batteries out. Fill the camera's up, every delicious off-the-cuff moment. Man, you better check yourself, bro, because I'm not shooting confessionals. This is a documentary. This is not Real World, Bigfoot Edition. Wait, Bigfoot Edition? This is bullshit. What's up with that? You guys didn't tell him? Tell me what? It's the show. The show guys we're going to go interview, he's claimed that he's bagged himself a dead Bigfoot. What? I believe you guys didn't tell him. Stay with me here, Kev. It's all a hoax. The whole thing's a fraud, OK? I wouldn't be surprised if it's-- No. No it's not. I know this guy. I've seen him on the internet. - What? - Yeah. Dude, this is epic. Come on. Like-- no, this guy actually found a dead Bigfoot. Guys, we're going to be fucking famous. Good spirit, Kev. - Thank you. - See? It's totally epic. Are you guys related? Do we look like? Look. Depends on the light. Look at us. Look at us. I'm good, thanks. All right, Darryl, what do you want to-- which way do you want to go here? I think-- I think on your right. On your right. - Over here? - Move to your right. - All right, cool. So we'll catch-- we'll start on this? Yeah, hang tight. Hang tight right there. Yeah. OK, all right. Let the genius step in here. OK, check it out. So we got this nice color, nice depth of field. We got you and the small rocks-- Start up here. --Then we glide across, and you got you and the big rocks. - OK. And this is where it all happens. Little travel in the shot, land there. This is where it all happens. Yeah. I'm going to win an award for this. You make magic with the camera? - Yeah. - All right, good. Let's go. Let's do it. - All right. - We got it? Yep? Everybody set? This is it. All right, how's my hair? It's still there. Robyn? Thank you. So, Mr. Reynolds, finally back in the saddle after four years, tell me, what to you skeptics do, when you get a case of the jitters? Mostly we act competent. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. And I'm sure you'll give us one of your patented goddess shaman blessings, before we shoot? - Well, of course. - Good. Darryl, we're going to shoot that next. Of course we will. No, if you want a blessing, let's just do it now. Well, I'm ready to go here. It's raining, so we'll save the fucking blessing for next, OK? Come on, come on. Rain, we got to go. Sean, consider yourself blessed. Thank you for your professionalism. Are we-- Kevin, are you set? Yeah. Sweet. All right. When you're ready, buddy. Kev. What? Soundman doesn't usually stand in frame. Come on. Over here. Oh, yep. Sorry. Thank you. Got it. You're awesome. Yeah, microphone doesn't normally poke the talent in the head either. Oh, OK. My bad. My bad. Step away please. Thank you. You're rolling. Hoax Busters, intro take 1. California's lost coast, more than 400 square miles of unpopulated forests, mountains, and streams-- but maybe not so unpopulated. Here we are in beautiful northern California. More rain's set in, and we should be at Fieldbrook any time now. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - What? What? - That was it That was it. You missed it. That was the turn right there. You missed it. - That? You must have blinked. You've got to be kidding me. That is a shack on the side of the road. The sign said Fieldbrook General Store. I'm fine. It looks-- looks chewy. Is it any good? Pretty good. Needs more basil. Buy stock in the company. I plan on it. Hold on. Hold on. Guys, this is him. I got it. Yes, hello. Mr. Drybreck? Yes, this is Sean Reynolds. The Sasquatch Bigstick-- it's actually ground from Sasquatch ass. - We're here. We're here in Fieldbrook-- It actually could be, like, a thing. - --Right in front of the-- - Hey, save me a bite. --Fieldbrook General Store. Hey, if you sit thre long enough, you will literally look like him. Yes, sir. Robyn-- Robyn. But you can grow hair on your chin, so it's-- you know, he can't do that. Yes? One second please. OK. Hold on a second. OK, go ahead. Uh-huh. 8.2 miles south out of Fieldbrook. OK. OK, then 4.2 west oak tree-- 2.6 back north. Uh-huh. And then? What is this, the Himalayas, man? OK, OK. Come on. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I got it. Can you even read that? Kev, we're out. Let's go. - Oh, sorry. OK. Bye. Thanks for the story. And I didn't mean the Santa Claus thing in a bad way. It's just-- - Kevin. --Beard. Sorry. Last mileage again please, Darryl? Yep, that is 4.3 miles on the nose. Well, it's been 45 minutes now. It's begun raining again. And according to Drybeck's somewhat complicated driving instructions-- Paranoid-- paranoid driving instructions. Thank you. Thank you. We seem to be lost. There should be a left turn right here. Great. Great, we're in the middle of nowhere with $7,500 in unmarked bills. Kevin. No, OK? Look-- fucking pot farmer gang members out here, man. There are hardcore Colombians and shit, man. Kevin, chill, man. Let it flow. - What? Ain't nothing like that's going to happen. You're much more likely to have a leg torn off by a Sasquatch. Darryl. It's like you're not even getting wet. How the hell's that-- Does that look anything like a road to you? That looks like a bike trail. I know. Fat tires. But hey, it could be. Definitely tire tracks though, yeah? Yeah. Come on, you guys. Have a little faith. What's the worst that could happen? Come on, baby. All right, all right. All right. We got to get something under that tire. I need a tree branch or something. Holy crap. Hey-- hey, Professor Bigfoot-- look, 9 o'clock. What's-- what's that? Ssh ssh ssh. Mr. Drybeck. Got the wrong tread for this terrain. Sean Reynolds. Yeah. It's nice to finally meet you. Your directions, they had us going there for a bit. These three are your-- your crew. Fine. Gather your things. Follow me, please. From here on out, we'll be traveling in my truck. I'm sorry. Wait. We're driving with this guy? Leave your van here. And hurry, please. We don't want to be traveling after dark. Uh, tell me, tell me you got that nice tight shot with good sound. Yeah, Sean. I got every word, even his comment about our inappropriate tread. I love you. Hey, hey. I'm not leaving this here. Buddy, this guy, he's made for reality television. Look at him. No. We just struck gold, guys. Get excited. Come on. Let's get the van unloaded. I come back and this is gone, I'm going to-- d'oh. Don't even-- These guys are made for, like, to catch a predator. Enough. And now for the sad part, folks. Handing over $75,000 just to a crazy man. And on top of that, he's covering all the production costs. He's spending over $100,000 on this. What? Emmy. Think Emmy. Think broke. Appreciate that. Oh. All worth it. One last formality, ladies and gentlemen. Cell phones, please. Oh, man. You'll get no reception at the cabin. And I assure you, you will get them back upon our return. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now, pass these out, please. Put these on your heads. What? And under no circumstances remove them until you are instructed to do so. Is that clear? Is that clear? Yeah. Yes, sir. Good. Quickly now, please. Here's your present, D. Great. Hoods. Guy's with the frickin' Taliban. I hate all of you. In for a penny, in for a pound, buddy. I don't know what that means. There's no handle. There is no door handle. Get in the car. What kind of car has no door handle? Tell me, is there no evidence for the Sasquatch that, uh, teases your doubt? Afraid not. Now that the Patterson film has been debunked, what do you really have? You got-- you got stories and footprints. Footprints. Hey, what's the Patterson film? I'm sure you've seen it, Mr. Coleman. Nothing less than a motion picture, with a large Sasquatch striding through the wilderness. Oh, right. Except it was a guy in a gorilla suit, and the guy who wore it confessed to it. Oh, God. Oh, God. Hey, puke on his floor, Kev. Come on, man. Let it flow. He deserves it. Oh. Jesus. Oh. We have arrived. Oh, Jesus. And as for that gorilla suit, several eminent scientists have all attested to the fact that it cannot possibly have been a costume. All right. Let me out. Let me out. Get that door open. It's coming. It's coming. Don't forget to smell it. Poor Kevin. You doing OK over there, Kev? You gonna make it? You're tough. Check out this little pow wow. Who's that guy? Remember the, uh, press conference footage? Yeah. That's Jacques La Roche. Oh, right. Canadian tracker, been Drybeck's number-two for years. Yeah, I remember that guy. Mr. Lancaster. Get away from that pole. It'll kill you. That'd be good. I take it we can start unloading the truck then. Your sleeping quarters are there and there. Main cabin's up there under the trees. I'll see you all for supper shortly. All right. And over there, that's where I'll get hacked up. And over there, that's where Sean will get hacked up. Kevin. Chill, man. Jesus. Come on. Help me get the Bronco unloaded. - Yeah. Give me a hand here. Please tell me you brought a gun. Don't worry, old body. Get that inside before Bigfoot smells your lunch. So despite Drybeck's warnings of boogeymen, Robyn has taken it upon herself to welcome the forest people and a large community of mosquitoes. Meanwhile, as we step inside, it doesn't take long to note that our sleeping quarters are pretty spartan. No electricity. Kerosene lamps for light. No heat in these cabins either. But for those late-night trips to the latrine, we do have-- Nice. Oh. It's full. Oh. OK. We'll cut there. Uh, why don't you and Kevin take this cabin, and Robyn and I will bunk in the other one. Yeah. That's no problem. I'll pit my snoring against his whining any day, although he may need a midnight breastfeeding. I know you're good with that, so I can go to sleep with Robyn if you want to stay in here and help out. It's already cool. I've already milked off a couple of quarts for you. Are you shooting? Yeah. All right. Let's go. As much as I hate to interrupt Robyn's third welcoming ceremony, if I don't eat soon, Bigfoot's not the guy we're going to have to worry about. Hi. I'm very hungry. Did you hear that? What? Somebody's moving out there on the hillside. Probably like a squirrel or a raccoon, right? No. It's much bigger. Yeah. I think I heard some growling. But, uh, pretty sure that was my stomach. Oh, the energy here is very strange. It's definitely not what I would call welcoming. Let's eat. You heard her. Come on, man. I'm hungry. Let's eat. Let's go. Sorry. You guys coming? Yes. It's my bad. Is there any meal plan here? Or do we have to fend for ourselves? I don't know the answer to that. Heh. It's cold tonight. Jesus. Whoa. I found Drybeck, guys. Mr. Drybeck, um, we brought a whole bunch of technological gizmos and gadgets that work a lot better with electricity. We're completely cut off out here, Mr. Reynolds. And I have a sweet little generator in the back which will provide enough power for your lights, not to mention our primary means of defense against some, uh, recent aggression displays we've been experiencing lately at night. And there was light. Oh, nice. Oh. Lighting perimeter too. Worry about that later. Now, ladies and gentlemen, dinner awaits. Sweet. Best news I've heard all day. Watch your step. Welcome to we talk. Oh, ho. The gathering place. Nice. This just gets better and better. Check that out. Look at all this Bigfoot stuff. Damn. And now, red or white? Hm? I'm more of a red kind of guy, actually. Look at this, all right? Yeah. That's perfect. That'll get it. Except now your sleeve's on fire. What? Oh, Jesus. Oh, my gosh, Kev. Aargh. Kevin, you OK? Kev, hit it with your other hand. What? It'll put it-- it'll put it out. Just hit it with your other hand. - Don't just say shit. - Oh, my gosh. - Just smack it. - Stop. Stop. Stop. You all right? - Hey, you all right? - Yeah - You get it out? - Are you OK? Yeah. - You OK, Kevin? - Yeah. I'm fine. My bad. OK. Get set up for sound, huh? Please stop laughing at him. Let's get you a little more wine here, Mr. Drybeck. That's enough. Please. There we go. OK. Darryl, you all set? Got it. OK. First of all, I think we all want to thank you for what was an excellent dinner. Absolutely. Good stuff, Mr. D. I'm going to have to get that recipe. And also I want to thank you for letting us shoot outside. I know you're hesitant to be out here after dark. So I appreciate-- Well, caution is always wise, Mr. Reynolds. But since you have paid handsomely for the opportunity, I shall try to accede to your wishes. We will, of course, have to retreat inside at the first sign of any visitors, hm? OK. Campfire spook story. Gotta love it. Heh heh heh. OK. Uh, so just to kick things off, why don't you tell us your best Bigfoot story. More than two years ago, this summer, I was at the headwaters of the Klamath River surveying ranch property. My partner at the time, Frank Killbuck, had brought along his big yellow Labrador. He thought we might need one, and we did. One night when we returned to camp, we discovered that something had rummaged through all of our things. Frank took a lantern, followed tracks up a game trail. After a while, he came back, stood in front of the fire, looked at me. He said, Drybeck, that bear's been walking on two legs. I had no idea what he was suggesting, till about midnight when we heard it. I smelled it. Terrible smell. And there it was. Most disturbing sight I've ever seen. No further away than, uh, I am from you. It's, uh, steaming breath coming in, uh, short grunts. Towering ape, 9 feet, matted brown hair, it's eyes staring down on me. What did you do? Nothing I could do. Frank fired off the shotgun. The dog lunged for it and then go back out into the blackness, till we couldn't hear it barking any more. About 8 feet up, right above our heads, was the body of the yellow Labrador, impaled onto a tree branch. Whoa. It's a great story. No. I mean, whoa, something's moving-- --out in the trees. Just as I thought. The campfire's attracted their attention. Everybody gather your things. I didn't-- I didn't hear anything. Lucky for you. If you want to continue this interview, we will do it inside, please. OK. - Quickly now. - OK. Wrap it up. Let's head inside. Come on. - Oh, God. - Hey, guys. I'm ready to go here. - Yeah, we're set. We're set. Mr. Drybeck, we're ready for you. So, uh, where do you need me? Tonight, I thought we would lay the groundwork for my theory of the Sasquatch's origin and its purpose. And I thought maybe we could keep our audience awake. Sorry. Um, maybe you could give us just a little taste, a tease, if you could show us where you're keeping this evidence. I'm afraid that won't be possible, Mr. Reynolds. There's no way we could keep the evidence here at the cabin. Of course not. Why would you? Why would you do that? You have no idea the precautions we've had to take, Mr. Reynolds. We've got a pretty good idea. What with the bizarre driving instructions, the, uh, hoods over our heads, confiscating our cell phones, the electric fence running around the entire property. Oh, that fence, as you call it, is the key to everything we've accomplished. Heh. An electric cattle fence. What does it do? Keep Bigfoot out of the yard? Let me ask you something. Have you ever asked yourself why the, uh, physical evidence for the Sasquatch, its bones, its remains, why nothing conclusive has ever been found? Oh, I don't know. Maybe because Sasquatch doesn't exist. And yet, we've had an estimated 50,000 sightings in the last century alone. How do you explain that? Did you know that the Native Americans believe he's got one foot in the spirit world, able to move between our world and the next. That's epic. I'm sorry. It's just-- I-- you have like a-- you have a really great, uh, speaking voice. Kevin. So it just sucks me in and it freaks me out. Thank you, Mr. Lancaster. Two centuries of scientific study and it still defies explanation. Then stop. Stop trying to explain it and just show us the damn evidence. I-- I gotta tell you, Mr. Drybeck, with all of your, uh, delays and secrecy and your paranoia, it's starting to look like you're either a fraud or delusional. So now I'm delusional. Did your psychiatrist suggest this aggressive journalistic approach? Perhaps to, uh, forestall your next visit to the Pasadena Psychiatric Center. OK. We'll cut there. No, he's uh-- looks like he's done his homework. I wouldn't want to miss your delicious off-the-cuff answer, so go ahead. This could be gold. No. We wouldn't want to miss that, would we? Screw the evidence we came for. Now all we care about is Sean's mental breakdown? Man, I'm just saying, it's good stuff right there. What the hell was that? They're taking out the generator. What do you mean? Wait. What do you mean they? - Kevin. Kevin. Please, drop it. No. Who the hell's they? Robyn. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Did you hear that? Hear what? Outside. Listen. It sounded like something shouted from far away. Uh, no. I did not hear anything. I don't want to hear anything. Darryl, do we have the, uh, do we have the night vision cameras? Yeah, they're in the sleeping cabin, but don't worry, this shoots great in low light. Sweet. Guys, I'm not going outside. Now, that I heard. Oh, damn. Do you see anything, Sean? Ssh, ssh, ssh. That was no canine, I assure you. It was the start of an aggression display. Meaning, of course, it's-- Your hoax, Mr. Reynolds, your hoax. And as such, our priority should be re-electrifying the perimeter fence. Yeah? You gotta put the tinfoil hat back on this, 'cause I got you. I got you. Let's go get it. - No. No. No. What it-- guys. I highly recommend you stay inside. Yeah. I'm not going outside, guys. That's just it. You're putting the camp-- we're going? So there's a hundred different animal species right outside that front door. We're out in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the woods, and your first explanation for a sound is Sasquatch? Come on, Kev. Yeah, I'm not getting much, but I'm getting a dim shot of you. Kevin, you hearing anything? Nothing, except my heartbeat. Listen. Over to the right. This show just went up 10 rating points. That's the promo right there. Did you see? No. I don't see anything. Oh, guys. Drybeck's in the shed. Check it out. Oh, damn. That's a direct hit. That'd just be an accident, though, right? Or somebody threw it to scare us. You think La Roche did? Yeah. Probably. I bet you that's it. Can you fix it? Not tonight. We don't have time. Mr. Reynolds, shut off the light, please. Right now, I wouldn't mind if it was La Roche. It was not La Roche, I assure you, or any other human for that matter. You talk about evidence, Mr. Reynolds. I would think this is all you need. Well, since the fence cannot be repaired tonight, we have no choice but to retreat inside. Maybe we should do what he says. OK. OK, you follow him. You film every second. You're not coming? What do you say, boys? A quick trip around the perimeter? Stop at the cabin, get some fresh batteries? You risk killing me to get fresh batteries? You know what? Hell with this. I'm going with Robyn. Be careful. Darryl, come on. What do you say, man? Death by Bigfoot. It'll look great on your tombstone. It's La Roche. This is the Canadian tracker guy. He's been, uh-- What'd you hear? I don't know. Nothing. Come on, man. God damn it. Did you hear that? No, man. I didn't hear shit. Well, our first night that we're out here, all this crazy stuff starts to happen? Listen. What? Did you hear that? No. Look out! Go. Go. Fucking. God, where the fuck did that come from? You're not fucking kidding me. I'm not standing around and getting something dropped on my head. Now, get the fuck outta here. OK. OK. OK. We can get the batteries later. Let's get back to the cabin. Come on. Oh, they're heading back, fast. Something happened. Mr. Lancaster, step away from that window. Those noises, I take it that you've heard them before? For the past several weeks. Damn fools. I warned them. And now I'm warning you. Step to the center of the room, please. What are you going to do? As little as possible. But they've never taken out the fence before. Gotcha. Damn it. Awesome. Now you got a gun. That is a fact that you may come to appreciate, Mr. Coleman. Now, please, gentlemen. Step to the center of the room. We didn't see anything outside, just, uh, there's somebody thrashing around making noises. Still almost died, though. What? Yeah, a falling tree branch. Yeah. That's typical. Hey, man. This battery's not going to last. Listen. What the? You wanted evidence, Mr. Reynolds. Yeah, some evidence. La Roche could be out there. Please, keep your voices down now. Oh, my God, this isn't happening. This isn't happening. What, is it throwing rocks now? What? Hey, La Roche is throwing rocks. Yeah, right? Gah. Ssh, ssh, ssh. OK. That got me. Easy. Heh heh heh heh. That was pretty good. - That was good. That was pretty good. He's not done. Oh, come on, man. You just going to stand here while it comes through the wall? - Hey! Turn that light off! - Hey. Not cool, man. - Guys. Everybody down. You think it's funny with just playing us like this, huh? - Easy. - Ssh. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is out there? Quit fucking around. Mr. Reynolds, don't. Don't. Fuck it. Something else, please. I gave you 75,000 reasons to let me do what I want. Please don't open the door. See who it is. Heh heh heh heh. - Oh, man. - All right. Gimme, gimme. - Oh, that was good. Give me a recap. - Oh. - That was good. We got some good stuff. Give me a recap. Let's do this quick. Hold it. Hold up. OK. OK. OK. Hey. Night number one here at the Drybeck cabin and far from an uneventful one. A series of unknown noises from the north, south, and east walls of the cabin. Their origin unknown to us. Our brief foray into the black beyond this door revealed no clear source of the sounds. So now we wait. We wait. That's where we'll end. Nice. Darryl, what is the only thing better than 12 episodes, my friend? 13 episodes. 13 episodes. That's it. Shut it down. We're good. Heh heh. Good stuff, man. Good stuff. OK. It's been more than an hour since the last noise now. And believe it or not, the world's bravest woman says she needs her beauty sleep. Respect the unknown, gentleman. Don't fear it. Fear? Shit. I'm excited. I mean, what's better than heading off to ice-cold sleeping bags and cabins with cardboard walls? Thank you. You're welcome. There's no way I'm going outside, man. I'm sorry. I'm staying here. OK. You're more than welcome to stay here. Stay here with crazy shotgun dude. Come on, gentlemen. Our visitors, whoever they are, are long gone by now. Yeah, come on. Ugh. Damn, it's dark out here. Did I mention I had poor night vision? 'Cause I do. I wish I did. Moonshine. Wait. No. No. Hold on. No. Hold on. Wait. You get to sleep with her, and I'm stuck with Darryl? Come on, man. I threw up. I set my arm on fire. This is bullshit. He's got a point, you know. I mean, between my snoring and your moaning, he's pretty much fucked. Darryl. I'm not a moaner. I'm a screamer. Oh. Oh ho. So to make it clear, when she does scream, do not come help. Fuck you, man. Don't kid yourself. Heh heh heh. Come on, Darryl. Hey. Hey! Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Hey, Drybeck! Stop! Damn it. Hey. What's going on? Drybeck. He just-- he took off. What? Drybeck just took off like a bat outta hell. Fuck. That figures. He take the money? He took the money, right. No. No. He took my breakfast order. I'm sure he'll be back any-- - Fuck. I don't know. I knew it. You fucking pay an old bastard like that-- Hey. --75 grand, it's a fucking expensive camera. It's not the end of the world, OK? Fucking A. Relax. Hey, he left the generator on for us. What a nice guy, huh? $75,000 electric bill. Get Kevin up, will ya? Damn it. Kevin, wake the fuck up. Robyn. Hey, Robyn, we got a problem. Rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty. It's Von Trapp family meeting time. What happened? Drybeck's gone. Get ready. I'll meet you outside. Relax, Darryl. I'm sure he had a good reason to take off this morning. He's playing us. He's probably out behind some TV watching this whole fucking thing. Morning, Kevin. Hey. Morning, Kev. Want coffee? Here you go. There's toast in the kitchen. You're lucky I love toast. We may have been abandoned. At least we've got food. So fearless leader, what is the game plan now? What's the genius move, huh? Lead us into the light. What? Like we've got a choice? We're hoofing it back to the van. OK. I checked it out. The tire tracks are as clear as day. Well, not so fast. You see, I've spent this morning going over some of last night's footage. We're getting gold here, people. Dude, the man split with your money. He's not coming back. We can't shoot without him. Great. He's on his way to Jamaica. That's my problem. In the meantime, we should get as much footage as we can. Are you kidding me? Dude, we are cut off out here. We're in the middle of nowhere. - Yeah. But there's got to be some physical evidence for the noises that we were hearing last night. Ha ha. That's my girl. Exactly. Fine. Two more points, I'm in. Yeah, damn. I-- I didn't sign up for this, man. OK. Hold on, boys. There'll be plenty of time to talk about that later. Today-- That he gets. --It's war. Darryl, I want you to get out to 8 to 200 millimeter zoom. Going to be a lot of low-light situations. Kevin, bust out the syncing mic. Robyn, pack up the game cameras. You got it. Technology is about to kick Bigfoot's ass. Uh, sound is good. Kevin. Kevin. Hm. Oh. Damn, I wish Curtis was here. Hey, you gotta to step outside. It's a simple concept, man. There's a rectangle. You just stand outside of it. - OK. OK. My bad. You know what? Don't even sweat it. I got it. Day two. Scene 1, take 3. Thank you, kitten. And Darryl, don't be filming my ass when I walk away either. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Coleman. Thank you. So after a literally disquieting night in the Drybeck cabin, we've begun in earnest our search for the first hard evidence of the existence of Bigfoot. And given the nature and proximity of last night's noises, we've needed to look little farther than the exterior of the cabin. And I have to say, the damage is quite extensive. Numerous impact marks here, and if you look just a little further down and a little closer, you'll find what appears to be claw marks. And, nice touch. Now, I'm going to step back for a second. It's right about here where you are suddenly confronted by what is an absolutely overwhelming odor, incredibly unpleasant. So I'm going to do this as quickly as possible. We have right down here on the side of the cabin what appears to be urine residue. Bigfoot urine? I'll let you be the judge. And we'll cut there. Oh, my God. You think he could have at least written his name or something. - Oh. - Maybe it's Drybeck's La Roche loves asparagus. How can you guys be that close to that? This is good, man. This is good. This is a great setup. Not too bad. Oh. OK, Darryl. What do you think, man? I mean, heh, part of me wants to ridicule how obvious this is. No, no, no. Let it build. Let it build until the end. Didn't you learn anything from Scooby Doo? Come on now. Fuck this, man. Oh, Kevin. Zoinks. Let's get down to the river. This is awesome. Come on. Let's move, guys. But the feeling is totally different here. I don't know. Actually, in a way, it feels more balanced. But there's something else. I don't know. There, by the stream. Oh. Hey. Guys, check it out. - Slow down. - Oh ho ho ho. - Jesus. Sorry. My bad. Darryl? You getting this? Got it. OK. Um, We found some conveniently large and clear footprints. For reference-- - No. Go to the other side. Other side. Oh, OK. Oh, this is nice. All right. Start over. So we found some conveniently large and clear footprints here. For reference, I'm a size 11. I thought you said this was a hoax. Kevin, they're footprints. Come on. I could make it look like a Tyrannosaurus walked around here if I wanted to. What the hell is that? That is a tree, Kevin. Sorry. Freaking out. Freaking out. Hey, I'm going to check down this way and look for more footprints. I'm going to check the other side. I should've left this morning. I would be remiss at this point in not remarking on the landscape behind me which, to me, seems eerily similar to the landscape we all recognize from the famous Patterson-Gimlin film. Hey, guys. Over here. Oh. Ho. Nice. So here, we've found another set of prints. No. Down here. There it is. Well, that clears things up a bit, doesn't it? Heh heh heh. Tell me, Darryl, my friend, does Drybeck strike you as the sort of guy who wears sneakers? No, he does not, Sean. He strikes me as more of a Jack boot kind of guy. You think this is La Roche? Ah, well, I find that the simplest explanation is usually the best. I concur. All right, you guys. Why don't we spin your theories later. Let's just try to get a feel for what's going on around here. Well, I want to get a feel. I think she said she wanted to feel you. Oh. I didn't mean it that way. Thank you. - Guys. No, no, no. You could have meant it that way. - Guys, could we be-- - We're talking a feel. Can we be respectful? - Come on, Kevin. - All right. I'd like to feel. Yeah, everybody wants a feel. Feel it up. God, do you see what I'm dealing with? Robyn's been doing her psychic thing for a while now, trying to get the vibe of the area. But from the looks of it, she's not very happy. Oh, hold on. Hold on. - What are you doing? - Ssh ssh ssh ssh. - Come on, dude. - Stop. Stop. - I'm in the middle of a take. Shut up. You hear that? Wait. Right there. Yeah, Kev, sometimes those mics get a little bit too sensitive. Just chill out, man. What is it, Kevin? What does it sound like? OK look. Either you guys are fucking with me, OK, and that's not fucking funny, or I heard somebody, something talking. OK? But I don't know. I've never heard that fucking language before. Kevin, calm down. All right. There's nobody talking up there, all right? Between the footprints and your voodoo vibe, he's just a little freaked out. We're OK. We're good, right? - Yeah. Dude, check out these branches. All right, come on. For what it's worth, I think I found a nest down there in the clearing. - You found a nest? - Yeah. A Bigfoot nest? Yeah. Come look. Follow down here just a little bit further, we run into what Robyn is now claiming to be a Bigfoot nest. I want to get that right. As we approach, the smell really hits you immediately. It's obviously-- it obviously appears to be made by an animal. - You know what? - As we look inside-- You know what? Here. Fuck this, OK. - Hey, what's going on? Come on, dude. It's-- - You record your own sound, OK? - Kevin. Fuck, man. Kevin. You fucking approach the nest. Just-- you guys are fucking nuts, OK? I'm sorry. Do your own sound. It's not a Bigfoot nest, Kevin. It's some kind of fucking nest, and I don't want to be near it, OK? Sorry. Fucking-- All right. Take it easy. Can you just-- I know you got a camera. Can you just hold that up? How am I going to-- Just hold it, please. Please. Thank you. - Look. Just-- I want to show you something. What? Smell this. It smells like them. They've been here. Oh, God. Ho. Jesus. It smells like a wet dog lost a fight with a skunk or something. OK. You know what? You know what? I want to put the game cameras here. I want to put one here. I want to put one back down by the creek where we found the footprints. OK? Sean, you're not going to catch him on a game camera. No, no. Don't-- don't-- don't be too sure about that. Anything comes within 20 feet of these babies, they get snapped. We're going to get whatever comes by here. And it doesn't have to be a Bigfoot. Yeah. That'll work. Is that pointed right? Does that look right? I want to get one by the footprints right away. Let's go. Hey. - Just give it to me. Hey. Hey. Hey. You all right? - Yeah. I'm just going to go check on Kevin. Don't worry about it man. She's all right. Oh, great. Now what's he doing? What do you think? He's leaving. What? - You freaked him out. - Yeah. Seriously, folks. It's been fun, but I'm outta here, OK? - Kev. - No. I don't know what you guys are trying to pull, but there is no way that I'm going to be your Guinea pig. Shit. Seriously. You're going to walk away just like that. Yes. Yes. I will take a 30-minute hike back to the van over another night in this freak show. Kevin, hey. Kevin, come on, man. God damn it. Come with me, Darryl. No. Darryl, come with me. - No. Come on. Look. Hey. Hey. You want to be punked by these guys? I'm not going to be punked by these guys. I'm not going to lose my 15 % of the show. Jesus Christ. - Kevin. No. Let it off. Hey. Hey. Hey. OK. - Stop. - Jesus. Chill out. Look. I'm not saying don't go. In fact, I think you should hike back to the van. I'm not staying another night here. OK. We don't have to stay another night. I would like to know what you're planning on doing with the van without the keys. So, yeah. You hike back to the van. OK? I'll give you the keys. Only I want you to drive it back here, OK? You said we're not staying another night. And we won't. We'll shoot the rest of the day till it gets dark. Then we'll pack up nice and neat and leave. You want to get paid, right? If you do this, you'll get everything that's coming to ya. Give me the keys. OK. Now there's one more thing. It's no big deal. I just want you to wear the body mount when you hike back to the van. - No. No. Sean. No. - Will you stop. - You are-- - Excuse me. - --Ridiculous. - Excuse me. Do you mind? - You're outta control. Will you take a second? Take a breath. - Get off me. - Will you calm down? Come on, guys. It's not a big deal. I just want him to wear a camera. It is a big deal. So just relax while I handle this, OK? I just want you to wear the body mount when you hike back to the van. - That is sick, man. - You can do it. - That is sick. No, it's what you're going to do if you want to get paid. Give me the keys. God help you if you don't come back with that van. You know what? I don't-- I don't like-- I hate you and I hate your shirt. I hate everything. Noted. Kevin and Robyn and you too. No matter what happens, don't stop filming. OK. So night is approaching here on day number two at the Drybeck cabin. Our sound engineer, Kevin, was so shaken by what he heard, he's hiked back to retrieve our van. That was more than an hour ago. And we're still waiting. As for Carl Drybeck, there's still no explanation for his sudden disappearance this morning. And as the hours tick past, whatever small shred of credibility he still possessed is rapidly vanishing. Without his incontrovertible evidence for the existence of Bigfoot, we have little more than footprints in the mud, moans and groans, and Robyn's heebie jeebies. Did you get that? - Got it. - Yes. Damn. I would watch this. I would so watch his show. I hate television, but I will watch this show. Heebie jeebies? This is good, man. Heebie jeebies. That's what you think I have? OK. That was unfair. It's more like you've got the willies. Or da creeps. Well, hey. If you wanted me to keep my mouth shut, you should have said so. Right. OK. You're right. I apologize, OK? Finito with the sarcasm, I promise. You too. While we wait for Kevin, will you please let me do my thing? OK? Sage ceremony? Get the night vision camera ready. - Got it. - I want that. No no no no no no no no no no no. This is important. I have to figure this out. I totally agree. I couldn't agree more. And I want you to do your thing. But I want you to get it on film. OK? We'll set you up in the body mount rig. Nice, tight shot on your face. It'll be perfect. You gotta let me. Sean. I need to focus. I'm doing this for you, you know. Thank you. Looking good. Yeah, that looks good. Drybeck tries anything, he's going to stand out like a sore thumb. Hope he does. It would be a good end to the show. What does she do with that stuff anyway? It's called a smudging. Done this on a lot of shows. Then what? She gets the sage burning. Then she waves it around. Supposedly it clears away any bad mojo. In the clear and perfect channel, light is my guide. I think she heard something. Mr. Drybeck? You guys, not feeling so good. Please. I don't like this. We've got to get closer. Where's that sound coming from? Robyn, where are you? Rob-- Oh, shit. What the fuck was that? What the fuck was that? A fucking bear? Shoot. Sean? Darryl? Robyn! Robyn! Robyn! Sean! Robyn! Robyn! Robyn! You all right? You all right? Get her back to the cabin quickly. She OK? You son of a bitch. Now, you-- you expect me to believe-- Hey! Hey! --You didn't anything to do with this? Get her back to the cab in. She's hurt. We're not safe out here. Now! - All right. Get the fuck going. Come on. You OK? Can you walk? - Everything OK? Can you walk? You OK? My leg. Hey, you don't want me to film this, I won't. The show must go on. Besides, I can use this in my lawsuit. Oh, God. Oh. Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. Lawsuit, nothing. He's going to jail for that. Actually, it's you that I'm going to sue. That's funny. What the hell happened out there? I mean, was is Drybeck? Did Drybeck carry your through the woods? Does this look like something that Drybeck could do? I don't know. I was just too stunned. It happened too fast. It doesn't matter. He's responsible anyway. Where the hell is he? Drybeck! Drybeck! Guys, I don't think I'm going to be to walk. No, no, no. You're not going to have to. - We got you. - Sit down. You stay down. We got this. Hey, did you hear that? Robyn needs a doctor. Now, we're getting outta here. Where the hell are the cell phones? Cell phones are in a desk drawer. As far as leaving, I'm afraid that's impossible. The hell it is. Wait. What? We're getting outta here, and you're going to give me the goddamn keys. If you only knew how dangerous it was to even set foot out here. The only danger we're facing out here is from you and your douche bag partner. Yes, my partner. If you only knew what La Roche was doing. He has been keeping an eye on us for our safety. Good. Finally some truth. Now, here's some more. You're going to give me the keys to this truck, and we're going to take Robyn to see a doctor. Give me the keys. Aargh. - Hey, mother fucker. - Aargh. Back up. Back up. Mr. Reynolds. I got the keys. What you're suggesting is pointless. I have been trying all day long to find a way out to the main road. What the hell is that sound? That's La Roche. Here, give me a hand. He's badly injured. He has a concussion. Oh, shit. Dislocated hip. Rush. I've been trying unsuccessfully all day to get him to the hospital. Mr. La Roche. He's unconscious. He looks like he fell down a hill or something. He me get him back inside the cabin. What did you do? He's going to a hospital with the rest of us. Mr. Reynolds, there's no way out to the main road. I've been trying all day long. Every road is blocked. Why can't you understand that? Every road is blocked. He's bullshitting, man. Now, you stay back. Stay back! You keep an eye on him. - Hey! Hey! Hey! You put that camera down. You help me get Robyn in the truck. - Yeah. - You keep an eye on him. I got it. I got it. You and your fucking two-bit shoots. Get us outta here, buddy. Robyn, you OK back there? - Yeah. But none of these cell phones are getting any reception. No bars, nothing. Damn it. Oh, mother fucker. Shit. What? - God damn it. - Listen. I can't see. The fucking tree! Hang on. What the fuck could've brought that down? Christ. - It's a fucking redwood. Jesus. Jesus Christ. There's no way we're getting around that. Fuck! Kind of explains why Kevin's not coming back, huh? You want to fucking continue. So this is how it ends. Like most hoaxes, with a lot of indignation and bluster, only this time innocent people got hurt. You have to ask yourself, what kind of minds are we dealing with when an obsession like this turns deadly? God. It is not deadly. It is not fucking deadly yet. Not if I have anything to do with it. Get back in the fucking truck. Get back to the cabin. Get us outta here. You comfortable? Eh. Yeah. Nourishment. Eh. Thanks. How's the leg? It's a little bit better. Anyone seen Drybeck? Yeah. He was shuffling around earlier, taking care of La Roche. Oh, poor guy. I hope he's OK. Save it, all right? He probably got hurt trying to scare poor Kevin, dropping a tree on him or something. Jesus, man. What? My money says the wus just abandoned us. What is this? "Platoon?" Really? The dude is-- he's dropping acid out there. He thinks a war is going to come. What the f-- Stop. How's Mr. La Roche? He seems to be improving. Another damn bed should suffice. Stupid mistakes come with a price, I'm afraid. Boy, do they. And we're done paying. Young lady's injuries are not my fault. You were all clearly warned. Already. Fuck you, man. You really don't want to push me now. Sean! Sean! Do not defend him. We're leaving. OK? Thank you for the show. It has been a fascinating anatomy of a hoax. And you, you have played your part beautifully. Now, if you'd be kind enough to give us a ride to where that tree's blocking the road, we can carry Robyn to our van from there. I'll do one better than that. I'll show you the Coast Trail. It's a shortcut to, uh, Field Brook. You'll be safer and ultimately faster. We'll pass, thanks. No. And the trail will take us right by where we've hidden the body, the body of a completely intact juvenile gigantopithicus, Mr. Reynolds. The Sasquatch. Darryl, take this camera. Bullshit. Fucking Sasquatch, Mr. Reynolds. All right. This is your final opportunity, Mr. Reynolds. If you walk that road back to town, you will have completely voided our contract. Is that understood? Absolutely. I'll keep your money. Someone else will get the unveiling. Hah. Good luck. I'm sure networks will be jumping at the opportunity. Fair enough. And perhaps you'll be kind enough to film this as a teaser for the networks. And what's this supposed to be? The anatomy of a hoax, Mr. Reynolds. When I return, you can, uh, give me your decision. Let me guess. He's got Bigfoot's wiener in a jar. Right? No. It's a-- it's a finger or something. An orangutan. Who knows? It's bullshit, whatever it is. It's bullshit, whatever it-- Sean. No. We are not hiking out with Drybeck, OK? She's busted up. This show is done. I don't even know why I'm still filming this shit. If for no other reason to protect our asses in case something else happens. Keep that camera up. Fuck you, man. What? What are you thinking? It's the goddamn money shot. No. You cannot be serious. - 35 %. - This is bullshit. 35 %. This is money you want. You, guys. That's enough. This is my choice. I am the one that has to stay here alone. OK. I need to talk to Drybeck. Mr. Drybeck? Could I talk to you for a moment? Oh, of course. Let me just set down my camera. How are you today? I'm well. How are you doing? Just a little sore. Heh. I'll bet. Mr. Drybeck, um, last night when whatever it was that was carrying me, when it dropped me-- It was a Sasquatch. It was a Sasquatch, Miss Conway. Yeah. But it didn't feel like it was trying to hurt me. I mean, I don't know. It just felt like it was trying to rescue me from something. By dragging you through the woods? Well, by dragging me away from something, something dangerous. I'm sorry, Miss Conway. You just crossed into an area of Sasquatch theory that I find very difficult to take seriously. What theory? One that I've been arguing with Mr. La Roche for years about. He too believes the Sasquatch's role is that of a protector, a guardian. The usual Native American Indian fables. Mr. Drybeck, what are they supposed to be protecting us from? Why, the spirit world, of course, Miss Conway. Things on the other side. I'm sorry. Gotta put aside such childish fantasies, Miss Conway. What we're dealing with here is nothing more than a nocturnal primate, one that simply wants to be left alone. I assure you, you have absolutely nothing to fear. Shouldn't be doing this. Easy. Easy on the hill. Fucking bullshit. Slow. Hey, Robyn? Do me a favor. Before you lock those doors, you come in here and you get my gun, OK? Outer pocket. It's loaded. I'm going to put one in the chamber for you and de-cock it. All you gotta do, point and shoot. I am not touching your gun. I wouldn't even know how to use it if I needed it. - Hey-- - No. If it gets to that point, you will know how to use it. Just do as he says, all right? I'll feel better. Yeah, you'll feel better when you get your money shot. It's in the outer pocket. Outer pocket, OK? Watch where he puts it, please. Please, just watch where it goes. Remember where it is. I don't want you to have to use it, but it's better if you know where it is, OK? Fucking bullshit. Darryl, take this, please. Yeah, all right. Listen. Hey. I have to know you're OK with this. Yes, I'm OK with this. Look me in the eye, tell me you're OK with this. I am. I'm fine, seriously. I'm OK with this. All right. There's Drybeck. Look. I believe in you. I wouldn't be doing this otherwise. Listen. We'll be back soon, OK? I mean, it might be dark, but I promise we'll be back tonight. Hey. We going to do this or we just stand around all day? Because I'm fucking ready, man. I'm fucking ready. What are you gonna do? - Are you OK? Break a leg. Lock yourself in the cabin, please. Yes. Lock yourself in the cabin, please. Grab my gun. And turn his damn fence on. And promise me you won't go outside. I promise. Thank you. Come on, gentlemen. Let's head out. God damn. How much father, man? Watch you step, dude. Hurry, gentlemen, please. Your head, right here. We don't have much time. Hansel and Gretel shit down here. No no no no. We don't have time for that. Please, hurry. You want to tell me why you hid this thing so far from the cabin? So I can remain in possession of the body, Mr. Reynolds. What? So we're supposed to believe that you and La Roche dragged a 9-foot Bigfoot this far. I told you it was a juvenile. You'll find out for yourself soon enough. Now, come on. Juvenile. Watch your footing up here. You didn't mention anything about this being all uphill to the coast. Because this camera's starting to feel like it's made of lead. There. That's where you hid it. What, you bury it in sand? You hiding from pirates? There's a sea cave over there, gentlemen. We have a limited window of opportunity at absolutely low tide to access the passage. Otherwise, the sea blocks off the entrance. A convenient deterrent to those who want to, uh, claim our trophy. And who would that be? Oh, they're a legion, Mr. Coleman. Oh, God. Who talks like that? All right. Get the-- get the whole shoreline here to the south. Come on. Yeah. Is that the loop around where we came from? Watch your step. All right. Let's go. It better not be his wife. Get going in the cave. Hold up. Hold up. Mr. La Roche? Oh, God. What happened to you? Are you feeling better? My name is Robyn Conway. I've come to film the evidence. Drybeck. It's OK. Mr. Drybeck will be back soon. He-- he's with my friends. They went to film the evidence. Others. What? - Others. - Others? What does that mean? The camera. What camera? In the truck. The camera. What camera? Mr. La Roche? Follow closely, gentlemen. And don't touch anything and don't speak. Hey, can I use a light or what? Yes, you can use your light. Fucking dark in there, man. Come on. Follow my instructions to the letter. Is that understood? Whatever. We may have had some unwanted visitors. All right. Come along now. Water, water. Watch the water. Sean, get-- tight tight tight tight. Watch yourself. I said quiet. Don't speak. Oh, God. I did not sign up for this. This show better be sold to fucking MTV or something or I am personally going to go postal on someone. Oh, fuck this. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Here. Check this out, assholes. How the fuck am I supposed to get around that thing? I was brought on to record sound, fucking sound. This is bullshit. Oh. Oh, no. Oh. All right. Stay close by, gentlemen. You with me? Yeah. Quietly. This is OK. Quietly. It's just down here a little bit further. OK. It opens up up here. When it does, get all the interior. I want to see all this. Yeah. There she is, Mr. Reynolds. What you've been waiting to see is in that box. Recognize that? Ready, Mr. Conway? Yeah. OK. Bring your camera in here. Wait. Stop. What? We're not alone. What? There's something in here with us. All right. You stay here. I'm going to-- I'm going to go investigate. Wait. Where you going? - What? - Drybeck, where you going? Oh, come on. What the f-- That crazy mother fucker. All right. Let me get some shots of this thing. No. This'll-- this is going to-- this'll have to be the reveal. So get, uh-- build it up. Get everything around this and then get down tight on the box. And we'll lay some di-- ssh. Drybeck. Over there. Oof. Oh. You all right? Oh. Darryl. What happened? Oh, God damn it. I hit my nose. Let me see it. Wow, you busted it open, dude. Oh, fuck. You're bleeding. Fucking rocks, man. God damn, Drybeck. Shine your light over here, dude. I can't-- this-- this light's not doing much, man. It's dark in here. D'oh. Darryl, watch out. Ugh. Dude. I'm over here, man. Get the camera light on. Let's find the flashlight. OK. I got it. Shit. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. - Darryl, what? - I saw it. - What'd you see? I don't know. I fucking saw it, though, man. You saw Drybeck or you saw whatever Drybeck wanted you to see, OK? Come-- pull it together. Oh, my God. Run. Run. - Let's go. - Let's get outta here. - Drybeck? They've broken through. Who? Run. Jesus Christ, that's cold. Watch your feet. I swear I saw something. You didn't see that shit? It was fucking-- it was-- it was-- it was huge. Darryl, you didn't see anything, OK? Will you stop it? Will you pull yourself together and focus. I swear to you. You saw whatever Drybeck wanted you to see. Now, get over it. Put your head on straight. Let's get back to that cabin before Drybeck does. There. All right? Watch your step. There's rocks everywhere. Even though I may have never held a gun in my life, Darryl's right. I'll figure it out. Oh, God. No. Please, no. Sean. Darryl. Stop it! Stop it! Oh, my God. I should have stayed inside. I'm sorry. OK. Here's the story. About a minute ago, we heard what sounded like a gun. Oh, Jesus. What the fuck. Get down. He's right behind-- get down. Move. Where's Drybeck! Hey, Drybeck! It's Sean! It's Sean. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Put the gun down. Put the gun down. Let us help you. I saw it. Get back. Go! Go! Stay down, man. What did you see? You crazy mother-- God damn it. Hey, Sean.

Our investigation into the existence of Bigfoot has yielded no hardcore evidence. Nonetheless, we've paid a terrible price. My team-- Robyn Conway is missing. Darryl Coleman. Carl Drybeck is dead, by who or what, I have no idea. And now these lights-- --these lights, accompanied by sounds coming from them, and the clearing in the trees. The round, the clearing, and I see something moving. I see something. It's coming this way. It's tall. It's-- it's 8 feet, maybe more. It's moving. It's moving this way. It's-- Robyn, I hope to see you again. To my friends and my family-- --I'm sorry for what I've done. I'm sorry for what I have to do. Oh, my God. It's not a Bigfoot. It's not a Bigfoot!
