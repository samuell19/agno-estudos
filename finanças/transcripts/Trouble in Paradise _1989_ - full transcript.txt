I can't believe I ever fell in love with you. And as for you, Seth... You want to live through this, Rachel, then shut up. He's got it! That's it, that's it! We're rich, we're rich. He's got it! Give it to me, give it to me. [men laughing] Jake, look out! Rachel, grab the gun! Ow! Rachel, Rachel, I still love you. Shut up, Arthur. Oh! Oh, damn it. You shot me, Rachel! Your aim's improving. Thank you. I never thought you'd do this, Rachel. What? Leaving you here in paradise? [laughs] That's not so bad. Not that. Going off with him. Hey, Arthur, I may not be the best catch in the world. But if I ever tell you I'm dead, you can be sure it's the truth, and women like a man they can depend on. I'm sure you know what I mean. He's got a point there, Arthur. I hope you guys learn to love each other. And by the way... I never thought she'd shoot me. Oh, shut up, Arthur. Look what I found. Good girl. You were awfully brave back there. Not half as brave as I'm being now. Things have a way of not working out for me in civilization. Well, maybe this time it'll be different. We'll play it as it comes. How is that? You tell me. What do you think, Miss Mutt? [barking] Come on. [engine sputtering] Maybe we're not going anywhere. Oh. Mr. La Fontaine. Mr. La Fontaine? What happened to Jake? [engine starts] Well... All right, you can be the boss. ♪♪ ♪ My dear ♪ You listened to my fears ♪ You give a love so clear ♪ You hear my heart ♪♪ ♪ My dear ♪ You listened to my fears ♪ You give a love so clear ♪ You hear my heart ♪♪
