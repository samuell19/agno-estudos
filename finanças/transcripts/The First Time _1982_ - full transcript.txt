[ Music ] [ Horn honking ] [ Music ] [ Engine revving ] [ Music ] [ Engine revving ] [ Horn honking ] [ Music ] [ Horn honking ] [ Music ] What are you doing, Mike? Cut it out, will ya? Watch it, Mike! Mike! Kenny, are you all right? Mike, what did you do that for? Kenny, are you okay? [ Laughter ] Hey! Ken, geez. Mike, come on, cool it. Mike! Mike! Hello, Kenny. Oh, hello. Why are you watering the grass when you are leaving? Just a habit. I guess you are excited about your trip? Yeah, I'm excited. Your dad asked me to bring his briefcase over. Oh, he's right inside. Well, I guess I'll go in then. Charles? Hello. Hi, Pam. Darling, you shouldn't be doing that by yourself. Why isn't Kenny helping you. I couldn't stand the sad look on his face. I sent him outside. Is he still sad about leaving? Can't blame him. We're just here long enough to make new friends and now he's off again. You'll be okay. Honey remind me never to collect books again. Right. That's enough. I don't think Kenny likes me. Don't be silly. Really, he is very cold with me. He has been like that with everyone since his mother died. He'll get used to you. The trouble is he still thinks of me only as his secretary. Maybe if you told him about US it would make it easier. I'll tell him when the time is right. Before he leaves? No. That certainly expresses your feelings about me. If you really loved me you would tell him about US? Or perhaps you had no intention of marrying me, so why tell him? Do you really believe that? I do. I'll tell him before he leaves. All right? [ Dramatic music ] Sure not going to be the same without Kenny, is it? I don't know he hasn't left yet. Ask me tomorrow. You didn't like Kenny too much, do you? Sure, I like him. Just that I can't kid around with him like I can with you. Well, he is upset about leaving. That's no reason to push me off of my bike. You forced him off of the road, and you know it. I did not, we were racing. We ought to do something really special. You know, something he can remember. How about burning down the school? Come on, Mike, be serious. Look, I just don't feel like doing anything for the guy. He has been so moody lately. [ Music ] Hi, Kenny! Oh, hi! How's the water? It's great. [ Music ] [ Water splashing ] Hi, Mike. How are you doing? I got him to come. Kenny, you finish packing yet? Yeah. Hey, you know who is going to really miss you? Who? Rebecca Stanton. Come on. No, no kidding. That's what she told Mike at school last week. Did you ever make out with her? Of course not. She is just a kid. Hey, Kenny, when are you leaving? 6:00. It is okay if we come down to the airport and see you off? Sure, that would be great. Hey, Kenny, hey, how far is buffalo from silver Springs? It's a lot closer than it is from here. Are we still going to meet there like we planned? Sure, if my grandmother lets me go. Why wouldn't she. Grandmothers are like that. They are old. Not mine. She just got back from Florida. [ Doorbell ringing ] Oh, hi. Is Rebecca home? Well do you know where she is? Huh-uh. Do you know when she'll be back? Nope. Is your mother home? Could I speak to her, please? She's sleeping. She's sleeping. Listen, can you give Rebecca a message for me? Tell her Kenny, that's me, okay, I'm leaving at 6:00. Wait! Wait! It's united airlines, flight 602. Okay. Now you got it. Okay. Can you remember that? Sure. Listen, maybe you better write it down. I can't write. Flight 602 now ready to board at gate 12. That's yours. Hey, dad, I have been thinking yeah. I thought it over last night. Are you sure I can't go to Chicago with you? I will be there less than a week and then off somewhere else. I would in the way huh? No, it's not the kind of life for you. I just want to go with you. This is a big break for me, Kenny. I'm not going to get many more at my age. This company really believes me, and if I convince them of my work, they will probably set me up in one of their regional offices, and we can stay put. How long is it going to take? Two years. We'll have a place of our own. Sit on the front porch and fish. And by them you'll probably have a girl, like double dating. Sound good? That sounds great. We got to rush and catch the plane. Hey, Kenny wait up. It's great you came down. There were so many people in the lobby. Wow. How are you? Fine. How are you boys. I'm fine. Thanks. Fine, thanks. Hey, I want to take your picture before I forget. You get with Ken and Mike. Smile. I'll send you the pictures when I get them. I got you a box of chocolates to remember me by. Oh, thanks. Kenny. Aren't you going to open them. Maybe I better wait until I get on the plane. Come on, Kenny. Hey, don't forget to write me. Okay. Okay. Buy. Take it easy, Kenny. Flight 602 is now in final boarding stages. Hey, Kenny? Huh? I'm really sorry about the other day, about the bikes and everything. Well, I'm sorry too. No hard feelings then, still friends? Yeah, sure. See you later. First chance I get I'll fly and spend a couple of days with you. My secretary asked me to say good-bye to you. She wanted to come down herself, but she couldn't get away from the office. She is very fond of you. You like her, don't you? I don't know, dad, I never thought about it. You don't dislike her? No. I hardly know her. Kenny, how would you feel about -- flight 602, parting at gate 12. I better go. Take care of yourself, son. Kenny a little something extra for your trip. Thanks, dad. [ Somber music ] [ Music pace quickens ] [ Somber music ] [ Music pace quickens ] [ Somber music ] [ Music pace quickens ] [ Somber music ] [ Music pace quickens ] Dear Tommy, and Mike. I got your letter this morning. It sure sounds like you guys are having a great time without me. I have been having a great time too. [ Music ] My grandparents are really a lot of fun. I'm surprise to hear you went to the carnival with Alvin. If I remember right, we didn't like him too much when I was home. I met a bunch of great guys. We play baseball in the park every afternoon. My team is the astros. They want to make me captain of the team, but I got too many other things to do. [ Cheers ] You are going to get killed sitting there. [ Music ] They have got a big lake here. And I go sailing every weekend. The kids here are much friendlier than they are back home. And you ought to see the high school I'll be going to next semester. It's as big as a college. [ Bell rings ] [ Music ] Yeah? Could I have a coke, please? What size? Large. [ Crowd chatter ] Thanks. [ Crowd chatter ] Thanks. Dear, Tommy and Mike. I got your letter yesterday, but I was too busy to answer right away. The new girls you met sound nice. They sound like those young teeny-bopper types. Hi, Joe. Hi. How is it going? Give me something cold and wet. How about a coke? Anything, Frankie, as long as it has got ice in it. I have been hanging around with a couple of older guys, Frankie and Joe. Frankie is about . . . 21, and Joe . . . Well, is at least 23. Well, Frankie is the manager at the drugstore, and Joe . . . Smokes too much. There. What do you say, Frankie, about Saturday, huh? I don't know. It's different with you guys. Rosy and I are going steady now. Nick is going steady too, and it doesn't stop him from having fun. Niagara Falls is different. But why there. I tell you Frankie you never have seen a place like this before in your life. They have the most beautiful broods, the price is write, and there's no chance of catching -- are you writing a book, kid? No, just a letter. I was writing a letter. Uh-huh, sure. Joe, and Frankie and me go over to Niagara Falls a lot. There is a house there with the most beautiful a broods, and the price is right, if you know what I mean. We're going over to rosy's again tonight. About silver Springs, I'm still working on it. [ Fast-paced music ] Ah. [ Fast-paced music ] Ah. [ Squealing ] [ Giggling ] Telephone, Kenny. Hello? Hi, Kenny? It's me, Tommy! Tommy! Hi, how are you? Give me the phone, it's my turn. I haven't said anything yet. It's my friends from back home. Hello? Mike, is that you. Yeah, we wanted to surprise you. I can hear you as plain as if you were here in buffalo. We are here in buffalo. You wouldn't believe this place, we have a giant sweet, a shower inside the bathtub, everything. We just ordered room service. Yeah, and they told US they would give US clean sheets on the beds. What are you doing here? Are you kidding, we came to see you. Great. We can go to silver Springs together. Nuts to silver Springs. We want to go to niagara. What for? We want to go to that place you told US about. You know, rosy's, like in the letter. Yeah, your parents think we're in silver Springs. Yeah. They should only know. How soon can you make it down to the hotel? Yeah, how soon, Kenny? Kenny, are you there? I have to catch a bus. Well, catch it and come on, let's get going. It takes about 20 minutes. You have to finish the lawn first. I have to mow the lawn. We come all the way up here and you have to mow the lawn. It won't take long. We're on the fifth floor. We'll sit right here and wait for you, so hurry up. Okay. Okay, bye. Mow the lawn. [ Traffic noises ] What floor, please? Five. You did say five? Oh. 507? That way. [ Television speaking ] I came here to discuss your medical history. Let's make our own history, doctor. Kenny? Yeah? Kenny! Kenny, come on in! Glad to see you. Hey, this place is pretty snazzy isn't it? It sure is. Hey, wait until you see what we got. Come on. Champagne. Very nice. We have been saves it until you guys got here. How did you get it? I called the waiter, so he came up, and we hid in the bathroom. And we just laid the money on the bed. I just yelled at him, I said look just put it on the table, because we left the money on the bed. It was fantastic, the guy actually left it. A toast to rosy's. Well come on. Yeah, to rosy's. Rosy's. Rosy's. Boy, that's good, isn't it? Yeah, great. Listen, you guys wait here, and I'll go downstairs, I'll be right back. What? You have champagne, and I'll go down and get caviar, because -- well, that's what they always have with it. Let's go to rosy's Kenny. I have got to tell you guys something. What? What? We -- we have -- umm, we have got to break the glass. Break the glass? Why? You want to do this right, and that's what you do, you break the glass for good luck. Okay. [ Class crashes. ] Come on let's go. Mike, what did you do that for, we're going to get thrown out of here. He said break the glass. So break the glass. It's your turn.

[ Glass crashes. ] This is going to be great, you guys, isn't it? Don't you know? Of course he doesn't. This is probably his first time with a girl. It is not. What is it like, Kenny? What kind of place is it? Well, it's -- it's dark. Dark? They don't want you to see what you are doing. They don't? Uh-huh. What's the matter, haven't you been to one before? Sure I have. Where. By the bridge. Where north or south. What is this the third degree or something? Come on, tell US. Well, I almost went in one once. Come on. I guess you guys know this trip is going to be expensive. What are you talking about. It's less than a buck to niagara on the bus. That's not what I mean. It costs to get into rosy's. You mean like a cover charge. Sure. How much is it going to cost? How much do you guys have? I have about $15. I have $10. That's a problem. It costs at least $15 for everything. That sure changes things. You have got an extra $10, don't you? That's for pajamas. You don't need pajamas for rosy's. My mom gave me that money to buy some. But you don't need any. If it costs $15, how come you can afford to go so many times. They give me a discount. What? What do you mean what? Whoever heard of a discount in a place like that? I mean not the girls, the cover charge at the door. Oh, do you think you can get US in for free too? Yeah, maybe.

Kenny, hey, these girls, they are really pretty, huh? They are not beauties, yeah they are all right. Do you get your choice. Yeah, you get your pick. Don't worry about it. I was just wondering what if you get one that doesn't like to talk. Talk? You are not going there to talk. I mean, if you want to talk, call them on the phone. Well, if you do get one that doesn't like to talk, well, I mean, can you trade her in for another one. Well, I always like a girl that is a good conversationalist.

[ Music ] What is going on? They are asking everybody questions. How come they are stopping US, Kenny? They always do. They just always do. They didn't stop US back at the US customs. Well, they don't care who is leaving. Just who is coming in. Why? What do I look like the royal mounties? Hello. Hello. You are a citizen of what country. United States. And you. Me too. What with the purpose of your visit? We are sight-seeing. You are a citizen of what country? United States. How long do you plan to stay in Canada? Just today. Hello. Boy, that was scary. Just think, we are in a foreign country. Hey, let's go on the maid of mist. We didn't come all the way up here to take a ride on some water-logged boat. [ Traffic noises ] [ Whistle blowing ] [ Traffic noises ] [ Whistle blowing ] Canadians don't look any different than anybody else. Well, which way to rosy's. Listen. Yeah? Oh, it's that way. How far is it? Hey, don't you ever get tired of asking questions? You mad about something, Kenny? No, but you guys are acting like a bunch of sex fiends. Anyway it's early. Let's look around a while. There are a million things to do. Like what? Come on, I'll show ya. [ Music ] Listen, Kenny. [ Music ] Listen, Kenny. I have had enough of this wax museum stuff. I want the real stuff now. There is still plenty to see, Mike. [ Music ] Oh, wow. [ Music ] Oh, wow. That's really something, huh? Imagine going over that in a barrel? [ Music ] [ Falls roaring ] [ Music ] Isn't it beautiful up there? [ Music ] Isn't it beautiful up there? [ Music ] Isn't it beautiful up there? [ Music ] Isn't it beautiful up there? [ Music ] Look, we have been above the [ music ] Look, we have been above the falls, below the falls, behind the falls. We have been everywhere in this town, except for rosy's. We have eaten, we have rested. So can we please go now? Rested? I'm really bushed after all of that walking around. Why don't we sit here and relax a while. I didn't come here to relax. Can I please finish my hot dog? Eat it on the way! Tommy. Hold it. What? That is Randy Barrett. Who is Randy Barrett. She is in my biology class. She has the biggest mouth in school. If she sees me, she'll tell me folks, and they'll find out we were up here. Come on! [ Music ] It's that way. [ Music ] It's that way. [ Whistle blowing ] [ Music ] [ Whistle blowing ] [ Music ] Hey, wait a minute. We came up the same street about 10 minutes ago. Well, yeah, I know. I was trying to short cut and I got mixed up. Maybe I better take you guys the regular way. [ Music ] It's that way. I am so tired, I'll be ready for bed by the time I get there. That's the idea, Tommy. [ Music ] There it is! [ Music ] There it is! Well, this is it. Guys, this is rosy's. What? This dirty old dump? But Kenny, it's all boarded up. Oh, oh, they must have raided the place. Raided? Yeah. Geez of all of the rotten luck. Boy, when they raid a place. They really raid it. Look, Kenny, they even took the sign down. Well, that's great. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, we came all the way up here for absolutely nothing. There is always silver Springs. Nuts to silver Springs. This can't be the only one, can it? There must be other places around? Yeah, sure, Kenny, there must be dozens. Is this the only one you know about. Yeah, I'm afraid so. I don't think we can find another? Yeah, sure. Well, how, do we ask somebody? Yeah, go ask him. I can't go ask a total stranger something like that. Sure you, can. Just go up and ask him. No, I can't. Do it. Go on. All right. All right. Sir, sir, excuse me, well, my -- my friends and me, we're new here in town, we -- umm -- well, we were wondering -- uh-huh? Well -- could you tell me where the nearest whore house is, please? [ Birds chirping ] Sure. [ Birds chirping ] You'll see this great big house on the corner. Oh, and boy, really, thanks a lot. Don't mention it. Really, really, thanks a million. That's really great. Hey, we got it. Boy, that was sure nice of him. Hey, come on. I know where it is. [ Dog barking ] Boy, it's a lot more colorful than rosy's. It's just a department store. I know it. That guy was putting me on. Excuse me, sir I was wondering if you could tell US something . . . That's just great. Come here, you guys, I know where one is. Come on. Follow me. [ Music ] [ Whistle blowing. ] Hey, now, this is it. This doesn't look like one either. Yeah? How would you know? Wow. I hope they look like that. Yeah, come on. Hey, wait. With the luck we have been having, why don't we just call at it day. I got a feeling our luck is changing. Come on. I tell you one thing, a bad day is a bad day. We're jinxed. [ Music ] [ Applause ] This is the place. It is? Sure. Hey, did rosy's look like this inside? Not exactly. Of course not, stup. This is a bar. But any girl who works here is the same as a girl from rosy's. Umm. How about that, huh? Yeah, she neat. Don't you think she is a little too old for you guys? Not for me. [ Music ] Yes, but I have already tried that number. There's no answer. Can you think of any other place he might be. It's terribly important. [ Music ] Hey, bartender! Three beers. I would rather have a Dr. Pepper. All right. Let's see your identification. Oh, well, we didn't bring any with US. We're tourist, Americans. You must have some sort of indication, like a driver's license. No, we don't drive. Okay, kids, you have had your fun, shove off. You don't have to get rough about it. Just ask US to leave. Would you please try to locate him. Get him to leave a number where he can be reached. I'll call you back in a few minutes. Hey, baby, you are too good for this place. Why don't you come down to the states where people have some manners! What a putdown. Forget it, there must be dozens of bars around here. We'll find one. Don't order beer next time. Boys, excuse me, are you really going to the states. We'll go anywhere you want. Do you want some company? We sure would. Would you wait here a minute. Where are you going? I'm just going to make a telephone call. I'll be right back. God, she is beautiful. What a face. It's all pretty easy to me. That's how it is, they just come up and say, excuse me. Yeah. If you ask me, I think she's a Russian. She is just using US. Did you ever see a Russian like that? Did she talk like a Russian. She is probably one of her contacts. No, she isn't. Didn't it seem she didn't invite US up to her room. Shall we go? Anywhere you want. Have you ever been to america before? No, I haven't. Since we're going to be traveling together, I think I should know your names. I'm Mike. He is Kenny, and Tommy. What is your name? Anna. What is your last name? Just Anna. Are you a Russian? No, I'm not a Russian. He has a weird sense of humor. He is just a kid. [ Music ] [ Whistle blowing ] [ Music ] [ Whistle blowing ] [ Music ] Boys. [ Music ] Boys. Before we go ahead with this, there is something I have to tell you. You may have trouble getting across with me. I told you. Shut up. I don't have my passport. You don't need one. We don't have one. Americans go back and forth all the time. I'm not Canadian, i'm English. How come you are so worried. They stop US, they'll ask for my passport, and if I say something, you'll notice. Just don't say something. We could tell them you are deaf and dumb. Yeah. Or we'll tell them you are laryngitis or something. If I get caught, you may get into trouble. Let's just stay here. I'm not worried. I'm not either. Come on. [ Horns blowing. ] Hey, Mike. I would just like to know what we're doing, smuggling somebody across the border. I thought we came here to get a girl. What does she look like a giraffe. What if he get her across, what then? We do her a favor, and she does US three favors. No she doesn't. We should have gone on the maid of the mist. If you mention maid of the mist one more time, I'm going to belt you. If she says she is from someplace in the states, that's it. What about her accent. It's only one word. Let's find a city that she can say without an accent? How about Cincinnati? That's hard for even an American to say. Come on, Mike, this is serious. Try saying Boston. Boston. That's pretty good. What if they ask me something else? Don't say anything. We'll answer all of the questions. Come on. Boston. Bos-ton. Boston. Boston. Boston. Boston. See what it says, imprisonment. Shut up. Don't worry, if he asks what you are doing in Canada, I'll say you are my sister here on vacation. Yes, that's good. Where were you born, please? Boston, Ohio. Boston, Ohio? I mean, I was born in Ohio, and I live in Boston. Where were you born? Ohio. What was your purpose for visiting Canada? We just wanted to see what it was like? Bring anything back with you? No, of course, not, like what? That's all, thanks. Hurry up, Anna. Where were you born, ma'am? Boston. You in Canada on business or pleasure? My sister and I were here seeing the sites. We saw the observation tower, horseshoe falls, and three wax museums. Where were you born? Boston. Okay. Hello, ma'am. [ Laughter ] Wow. Wow, that was really close. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. You were just fantastic. Thank you. Well, you were good too. Hey, Kenny. What? Come here a second. Oh, excuse US. What is the matter? We have to talk about plan our strategy. Now is time to ask her for our favor. First we have got to get a room, right? What is wrong with the grass over there. One, two, three, you are finished. What is the matter with you? She is different. I have never met anyone like her before. There is something about her that's -- I don't know. She has something special. I know she does. That's why we have to plan it out. We have a perfectly good room back in buffalo. What if she doesn't want to go to buffalo. You just leave it to me, Kenny-boy. I'll talk her into it. Bye, boys. Things for everything. What happened? What did you say to her? Honest, I can't do anything. I just asked her if he is knew how many gallons of water went over the fall every minute, and she said she had to go. Hey, where are you going? I'm going to the bus station. Where are you going any way? Buffalo. Buffalo? Hey, that's where Kenny lives. Yeah, matter of fact we're going there right now. I mean, we have taken you this far, we might as well take you the rest of the way. Fine. The bus depot is right over there. The bus depot is right over there. Next bus leaves in an hour. Isn't there any other way to go to buffalo? I don't think so. That means we can go on the maid of the mist. Yeah, why not. Anna, you want to go? Yeah, come on, it will be fun. Boys, I'm really tired go ahead. You might get in trouble if you stay here alone. I'll be fine. I'm not so sure. Really, come with US, we'll show you a good time. Haven't we do all right so far? Yes, you have. Well, want to come? [ Music ] Love, in the beginning, around [ music ] Love, in the beginning, around the corner, straight ahead. Love, is where you find it. Summer skies and laughing eyes, and I think I'm in love again. [ Music ] Love, that is the answer to all the questions in your eyes. Love, can't live without you. With beginner's luck on your side, chances are you'll win. [ Music ] As the changes come before you, open up your eyes. Let the changes happen to you. Be wise. [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] Love, that is the answer to all the questions in your eyes. Love, can't live without you. With beginner's luck on your side, chances are you'll win. With beginner's luck on your side, chances are you'll win. [ Music ] As the changes come before you, open up your eyes. Let the changes happen to you. Be wise. [ Music ] [ Falls roaring ] [ Music ] [ Water splashing ] Do you want another? No, I have had quite enough. Thank you. Are you sure? Positive. I'll get fat. All right. But if you want anything, just say. Okay. Money is no object. Well, that's what my father said. When you are out with a girl, money is no object. Do you have a girl? You mean like going steady or something? No. Does that sound funny? What? My not having a girl? No. You obviously like to play the field. Well, don't you? No. I would like to have a steady girl, but it's kind of hard in my case. Why is that? My dad and I are always traveling around. And I never stay put long enough to get serious with anyone. What does he do? He is a textile salesman. Where is he now? I think he is in Chicago with his secretary. That sounds like you resent her. No, I hardly know her matter of fact. Does he always travel with her? Yeah, lately. Sounds serious. I think he's going to marry her. What does that do to you? I think it's fine, if she makes him happy. Marriage is great for some people. What's the matter? Nothing. Have you ever been married? What makes you think I'm not now? Well, you are not wearing a ring. Well, have you ever been married or anything? What do you mean by anything? [ Laughter ] You know, you are real easy to talk to. I never met a girl I -- I could just sit down and talk to like I can with you. Do you know what time it is? You are really in a hurry to get to buffalo, aren't you? Uh-huh. Come on, the bus is ready to go! So my buddy has this cabin down by the lake, and there was this speedboat, and it was a real bomb. We got Tommy up on skis for the first time. It was the funniest thing you have ever seen, right, Tommy. We really took off. And I had never been on skis before. We were doing about 50 mile-an-hour -- and I stand up -- ouch. [ Laughter ] He was going right for the buoy. I said get in the back and try to stop this thing. He can't do anything. He didn't even slow it. It was really something else. Hey, Tommy, I think we can borrow that boat again. Swell. I can't wait to get back up there. I'm going to try single skiing this time. [ Music ] Look, it's easy. We'll just say, come on, let's go up to the room. Expects that. That's too pushy. We would have been arrested for smuggling over here, and now you are worried about being too pushy. I'm going to ask her. I still can't reach him. Is there anything we can do? You have done enough already. Thank you, Kenny, Tommy, Mike. I really appreciate everything you have done. Good-bye. Anna! Why don't you come up and wait in our room. We live right across the street at the port hotel. See. It's very nice of you, but I have been enough trouble already. We don't mind. Really we don't. We don't mind if she comes up to the hotel, do we? I don't mind. And we have got our own phone too. [ Traffic noises ] [ Crowd chatter ] [ Traffic noises ] [ Crowd chatter ] Five, please. You got the key, Tommy? Oh, yeah. [ Giggles ] [ Horns honking ] [ Giggles ] [ Horns honking ] It's kind of small. No, I think it's rather charming. Yeah. Well, here we are. Um, here is the phone if you want to use it, Anna. Oh, I would love to. Thank you. Yes, operator, I would like 474-4039, please. Hello? This is miss Sutton again. Could you tell Mr. Hellland that I'm now at the port hotel. It's room 507. Room 507. He did? Oh. Well, thank you very much. That was the answering service. He just called in a few minutes ago, which probably means that he won't call back for several hours. Gee, that's -- that's too bad. Oh, I'm so tired. I didn't sleep last night. Why don't you lie down for a while. I would love to. Why don't you get under the covers. You would be a lot more comfortable. I think I'll get my clothes wrinkled if I do. Why don't you take them off, then? All right. Do you mind? I don't mind. Be our guest. Okay. Thank you. I'll fix this for you. How is that? Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. I need a coke. I think we could use a coke too. Come on, Mike. Did you see that? She is coming right out of her clothes. Yeah. I just can't believe that. She has got class. She hasn't even asked for money yet. Maybe she won't charge US. I think she likes US. We have got to pay her something. I wonder how much she'll ask for? Maybe 10? She can't ask for more than we have got, right? How much have we got? I have got 10. Oh, know, you are not going to start with those pajamas again! You are going to put it in your shoe? Yeah, why not? Are you going to bed with your shoes on? Are you going to bed with your shoes on? [ Chuckles ] Well, who goes first? Let's not talk about that now, okay? She's in there getting undressed, and he doesn't want to talk about it. What is the matter with you Tommy? I just want to have my coke first, okay? A little quick energy. Well, how are we going to decide? Odd finger. Great. Odd man goes first, all right? Okay. Ready. One, two, three. Hey, come on no holding. All together, right? Come on. One, two . . . [ Whistling. ] He could use a little quick energy too, huh? Okay. All together, ready? One, two, three! Oh. All right. Guys, it will be a while. Yeah. [ Distant traffic noises ] He is taking a long time, Isn't he? Isn't he? Huh? Taking a long time? What are you thinking about? I was thinking about colonel. Your dog? What are you thinking about him for? Remember that time Mrs. Cassidy borrowed that silly-looking poodle of hers. Pamper? Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, I put them both out in the backyard to play by themselves, but I watched them from my bedroom window. God, it was horrible, Kenny. Colonel howled and howled. Dad had to come out and turn a hose on them. What a stupid thing to remember. People aren't like dogs. Of course not. Come on. You know they are not. Yeah. [ Distant traffic noises ] Boy. It's about time. We were getting worried about ya. What is the matter? Nothing is the matter. What are you sore about? Who is sore. How was it, Mike? There is nothing to tell. How did you get started what did you say first? Hey, where are you going? Down to the coffee shop. Mike! Does she talk a lot? What is with him? Beats me. I thought you were supposed to be happy afterwards. I mean, I always am. Call it. Heads -- tails. A bad day is a bad bay. Anna? Anna? Anna? Anna, it's Tommy! Tommy? What is it? Look, Anna, I know you do this kind of thing for a living, and I'll give you all the money, I have got. Just do me one favor. Please tell Mike and Kenny, that I was really terrific, and we had a really great time. And I'll just sit here, and that's going to be it. And when the time is up, and you think I have been here long enough, well, just tell me, and guile out, and no one will know what really happened, because . . . See, I made myself a promise, that I wouldn't do this until I was married, but if I told Mike and Kenny that, they would laugh at me. They would just laugh at me. That's all. Is that all right with you? Is that all right with you? $11.17, and it's all yours, if you just promise to tell the guys I was great. I see. What's the matter? Tell me, who is coming in next? Well, Kenny. Oh. Hey, Anna, you won't tell them about me, will ya? No. Thanks a lot, Anna. I sure appreciate this. Tommy? Yeah. The money isn't necessary. Oh, Anna, you are terrific. Yeah, that's the word for me, terrific. Hey, thanks, Anna. You are the greatest. [ Whistling ] Well, Kenny. She is all yours. Where are you going? Down in the coffee shop. I really worked up an appetite. What is it with you guys? Will you just tell me? What is to tell? What happened? She was the greatest. What did you do? What did I do? [ Chuckles. ] What did I do? You have got to be kidding. [ Phone ringing ] Hello? It's me. Oh, Michael, I have been trying to get you. I left word at the motel that I couldn't make it. Didn't they tell you. Yes, I got the message, but there wasn't any explanation. What the hell are you doing here? I'm here to see you, of course. Why don't you pick me up now. What do I tell my wife? She is sitting in the other room? Well, tell her anything. What have you been telling her all these months anyway? Anna, we can't see each other anymore. I don't understand. It's over, Anna. I'm sorry. What do you mean, it's over? Good-bye. Michael! Michael? [ Sobs ] [ Knocking. ] Who it is? Well, it's Kenny, can I come in? No, go away. I'm sorry, Anna. Why should you be sorry? I was listening at the door when you were on the phone. It was not important. It was just another chapter in Anna's life. Why won't he see you? It's not important. Do you love him? What are you going to do now? Go back to Canada? I guess so. You might have some trouble getting across the border. I better go with you. After you have had your turn with me of course! Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm leaving! And I would appreciate it if you would get out of this room so I can get dressed! Can I ask you something, please? What? If you hadn't gotten that phone call just now, I mean, if you weren't upset, would you still? What is it? Did I do something wrong? Please tell me. It's really important I know. I don't think I understand. Why it is okay with Mike and Tommy, and not with me? What is wrong with me? There is nothing wrong with you. Yes, there is. I'm not the same as other guys. Like Mike, he has had a lot of girls. To be real honest, I -- I never even had one. Oh, this is always happening. What is? This. Like about a year ago, when I took out Sheila Dixon, Sheila is a school -- what every guy in my class has taken her out at one time or another. And everybody knows, you know, and so I -- I took her out, and she wouldn't let me. It's just like now -- Kenny! Please, sit down. Sheila sounds like a girl with a lot of problems. What happened that night, i'm sure had more to do with her than to do with you. How could that be? All of the other guys that took her out had a great time with her. But how do you know they had a great time? They said so? I think you'll find young men your age tend to exaggerate when it comes to their experiences with woman. Maybe so, but at least they had something to exaggerate. What is it about me that girls don't like? Is it the way I look? Oh, no, Kenny. Then -- then what is it? You know in many ways, you and I are alike. We have no confidence in ourselves. If anyone should have confidence in themselves, it's you. You are beautiful. [ Scoffs ] Evidently not everything thinks so. You could have a dozen guys if you wanted. I don't want a dozen. Well, I'm always available. You are very sweet, Kenny. I wouldn't worry about your lack of experience. The time hasn't been right yet, that's all. When will it be right? Oh, Kenny. You know, you and I do have the same problems, we feel we're getting older, and life is passing US by. You just haven't met the right guy yet. Now who is giving advice? [ Chuckles ] [ Distant traffic noises ] [ Chuckles ] [ Distant traffic noises ] [ Soft music ] Hi. Hi. Things go all right? What are you guys going to do now? Now look who is not talking? Are you going to stay in buffalo for a while or what? We were talking about going to silver Springs tomorrow. Why? I was just wondering. Listen, Anna is getting dressed, so you can have your room back in a few minutes. Where is she going? Back to Canada. Did she say anything about me? No. Hey, maybe we can go to the movies or something. I can't. I'm taking Anna back to the border. Why? She might have trouble getting across. She won't have any trouble. Besides you will be up half the night. I already told her I would. Hey, you are still coming to silver Springs aren't you? Sure. We'll talk about it tomorrow. We're leaving tomorrow. I still have to work it out with my grandmother. Kenny, I thought we were all set. Hey, you know something, I don't think he made it with her. Me either. [ Romantic music ] I love you, Anna. I really do. It will pass. I don't want it to. It will. Every young man must have his fill of conquests before he really loves, and I think you'll find I make a far better conquest than a love. I don't understand. You don't have to understand. It will happen anyway. [ Music ] I guess you'll be going back to that bar now? No, Kenny. I'm not going back there. I never worked in that bar. I was just using the telephone. And you assumed I belonged there. But Mike and Tommy, they said that -- but I told you, young men tend to exaggerate. But if you are not -- you are not from that bar . . . I mean, why -- why -- why did you let . . . [ Music ] Anna!
