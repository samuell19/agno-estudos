God! Leave me alone! Shit! Jeez! Fuck! God, what do you want? Come on! Fuck me! Leave me alone! God! Shit! Hey, kid! Can you swim? What? I said, can you swim? That's time. How's that feel? Pretty damn good. Like a million bucks, Doc. For some reason, I find that hard to believe. And you know how much I hate that Doc crap. Sorry, man. It's kind of hard for me to call you Ben when you got PhDs in things I can't even pronounce. What are you practicing for, Cirque du So Ugly? Aw, come on, Ben. It's a great arm workout. Gets my whole body in shape, not just my knee. Beautiful. So you can go out and get your whole body broke again playing college football. Come on, Ben, I'm still a young man. Hey, Peter Pan, I got news for you. You're not the same high school jock who used to chase all the cheerleaders across campus. You're 30, competing against guys 10 years younger. Hey, first of all, let's just watch the 30 stuff. If I remember correctly, you were one of those guys chasing the cheerleaders with me. Yeah, well, at least I gave up on the football thing after high school. That's 'cause you sucked. Don't you think it's time for you to rethink careers, maybe focus on the journalism? Look, I know how bad you want to finish out your last year of eligibility. Just stay off the enhancers. Remember the hassles I went through to get you in here after the incident at Naval. Ben, give me a little bit of credit, OK? I appreciate what you did. What time you got? It's, 6:14. Why? 6:14. You're so damn anal. Here, gimme the ball. Go out for a pass. No. No, no. It's only going to prove we're both too old for football. Hey, I'm not old. Now if you're saying you're too old, you can't run a pattern... OK. All right, all right, I'm going. You run like a girl. You run like a girl. Yeah. Ho! Son of a... What? See, everything here's on timers. 6:15, the sprinklers come on. Some of us venerable old timers know that. Hey, Doc. Pulling another all nighter? Yeah, I just need to check on a few things. You hear about this college kid, got himself killed in the mountains the other day? Paper said he was drunk, drove his car straight into a lake. No, didn't hear about it. What a shame. Yeah, kids these days. Well, try not to work too late. This is front desk security. We've got a problem. Here we go. Yeah, it's me. Looks like the good doctor is showing us his cards. He dropped some intereseting files in his rush to leave. Good. Let's move forward with Subject 4. He must be eliminated. Let's kill two birds with one stone. Already in progress. Let's make sure this one goes off right. No problem. Really? What's the cops' response time? 12 minutes. 12 minutes, right. Scotty, you screw this one up, I swear to God, I'll kill you myself. I got it, bro. No problem. It's all good. Hello? Hallie? Yes? Hallie, it's Dr. Roanic. Doc, how've you been? - Busy. Listen, I need to see you. HALLIE: OK. I could come by the clinic tomorrow. No, I need to see you now, Hallie. Doc, what's going on? Look, just trust me. I'm coming over. What was that? That's the door. I've got a date. Hallie, don't go. I'm serious. Doc, mix in a decaf. Hallie! I'll be right there. Hallie, don't go. I'm... Hallie. Hallie! I'm... All lines down, boys. Can I help you? God, I hope so. Batman and Robin, this is Commissioner Gordon. The Joker is on his way. Repeat, the Joker is on his way. Commissioner Gordon? Where'd they get this clown? It's the boss's little brother. Give him a break. Yeah, 911? I live at University Towers. I don't want to get anybody in trouble, but, there's this guy beating up this girl real bad. Hallie. Hallie, it's Dr. Roanic. Hallie? Hallie. God! Hey, man, what are you doing? No. Hi, Doc. He ran upstairs, officers. You take the left. I'll go right. All right, boys, where's our suspect? We're looking, sir. We haven't found him. Well, I'm confused. Did you follow him up here? Yes, sir. Well, did he grow wings and fly off the roof? No, sir. Well, then find him. Yes, sir. I'll get you, Dr. Roanic. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. I'm gonna get you. Ms. Holt. Ms. Holt! Ms. Holt has no comment at this time. Ms. Holt, will the violent murder of your daughter Hallie affect your run for Senate? I can assure you that this will in no way affect Ms. Holt's run for office. And I can further assure you, as senator for this great state, that we are making every effort to find Benjamin Roanic and bring him to justice. Now, thank you very much. Ms. Holt, how does it feel to know that your daughter's murderer is at large and the police are reporting no new leads? How do you think it feels? Knowing Roanic is still out there affects the way I look at everything... As a Senate candidate, and as a mother. I'm sure that anyone who has lost a loved one can understand that. Now, please, leave us alone. No further comment. Thank you. A memorial will be held today for Hallie Marie Holt, with services taking place at 5:00. PM at New England University. High student attendance is expected and extra security measures will most certainly be in place. This is the fourth death to rock this university in the last four months. Police are denying these incidents could be related as there's no connection between Roanic and the other victims. Detective Steven Birnam, who is heading the investigation, promises every effort will be made to bring Roanic to justice. I cannot believe that he hasn't even called. I wish there was something I could do. Honey, we all know it's a big mistake. I'm sure it will be resolved soon. Listen, I'm running late, so can we talk about this later? OK. What did I say about Pop-Tarts? It's not my fault. That's all your kid'll eat. My kid? Yeah, she's only my kid when she's good. Of course. I've got to go. Now, no more Pop-Tarts. No more Pop-Tarts. No more Pop-Tarts. Hello. Simon, it's Norm. Hey, Norm. What do you got, some Australian bobsledding you want me to cover? No, not this time, champ. What are you working on today? Well, nothing, really. Good, because I need you at the memorial service this evening. I don't know if it's such a good idea, Norm. I mean, you know that I don't think Ben killed her. Hey, a good reporter never lets his personal feeling get in the way of a story. A good reporter? Norm, weren't you the guy who said, "Simon is just a dumb jock and he only covers sports"? Come on, kid. Another thing a good reporter does is he never takes what people of higher authority say too seriously. All right, fine. But I need to have Thursday night free. It's my anniversary. Carla will kill me. Done deal. You cover the memorial, and I'll give you Thursday. OK, you can count on me. Yeah, right. Just get there on time. 5:00 PM, sharp. What are you looking at? Any sign of her? Negative. All's cool here. It's definitely no problem from where I'm standing. No, nothing from the watchtower. Just keep your eyes open. Someone even resembling Roanic shows his face, I want to know about it. Ms. Holt, I'm so sorry for your loss. Please accept these? Thank you. "Need to talk. I promise as God is my witness, I never hurt Hallie. She was my favorite patient. I don't know who killed her, but I know why. She was killed because of these." My god, he's here. Roanic is here. Roanic is here! What's the matter, Ms. Holt? This is from Roanic. All right, calm down. We're going to get him. He's not going to hurt anybody. We're going to find him. Get her out of here. Ms. Holt, this way please. Right this way, ma'am. You. Where did you get these? A man out there asked me to give them to Ms. Holt. What was he wearing? A blue sweatshirt. All right, listen up. I've spotted Roanic. He's headed toward the quad. He's wearing a blue sweatshirt. Somebody tell me they're on him. I got him. I got him. North on the quad. - Scotty, get the car. Cut him off. I'm all over it. I'm on my way. Andy, stay with him. Get your phone number from you a little late... I, excuse me. Let's go. Check it out. Look at this guy. Did you see that? Did you see that? Hey, where you going? Hey! Hey! Watch it! God! - Simon! Ben, what the hell? - I swear, I didn't do nothing. I didn't do it. I never thought you did, man. Now what's going on? Why haven't you contacted me? To protect you! You have no idea, the people involved. What are you talking about? Just let me help you! Simon... you can't help me, Simon. Now just get out of here before they see you with me. Ben! Hey! Hey! Shit! Fuck! DET. Guys, somebody talk to me. I got him. He's headed for downtown. DET. All right, let's close in on him. The subject, we'll just take him out. But he does not slip through. I repeat, he does not slip through. Does everybody understand? You got it, sir. I got him. Dude! Chase terminated. Subject down along with one operative. Repeat, chase terminated, subject down. Secure the perimeter. Start over there. Dispatch, this is unit 19. We need backup units on the scene as soon as possible. Is he gone? That's supposed to happen. That's not. What happened? I didn't see it happen, boss. That's the guy from the journalism building. My god! Find out about him. Yes, sir. Hallie and I were never really close. She was always daddy's little girl. After Jim died, things just seemed to get worse between us. All we did was fight. Seems we just reminded each other that he was gone. I haven't gone to her grave yet. I haven't gone through one box of her stuff. God, Richard. I should have tried harder. I wasn't ever there for her. Hey. Hey, Diana, this is not your fault. Roanic killed Hallie. That could never be your fault. I don't know. There's so much I didn't say to her. I wish... What? I wish I could tell her that I was proud of her. I think she knew. Damn. So what's the problem? These are Roanic's case study charts. They show how many pills are given to each patient and when. We're missing three pills. What? How? That's what I was going to ask you. Any chance he didn't write some down? Not likely. Phase II administrators are chosen for their diligence. We've got to find those pills. One of my boys informed me there was another person in the journalism building during the Roanic pursuit. He was also on site when Roanic was, um, terminated. Well, do you know who this mysterious man is? DET. Yeah. His name is Simon Tate. He was a local high school football star. He went to the Naval Academy, broke all their rushing records. What's he doing here? Well, the story goes he was kicked out of the Naval Academy after he tested positive for steroids, so he transferred here with the help of a friend... One Dr. Benjamin Roanic. It means we need to know what he knows and who knows it with him. Well, why don't you find out what Simon says? You know, steroids can be very bad for you, Mr. Tate. You hear what happened to Ben? Honey, I'm so sorry. No, Simon. No, I can't let you do that. Come on, Norm. That's ridiculous. I'm more than qualified to write this story, and you know it. I know you're qualified, Simon, but I'm worried you might be too close to the subject matter. How do you think people are going to react to an old childhood friend of a murderer writing an article on his innocence? First of all, it's not proven that he's the murderer. You said it yourself, Norm. A good reporter never lets his personal feelings get in the way of a story. But I think there's a lot more story here than we know. I just want to investigate it. All right. OK. But I still need you to cover the sports. And just remember... keep it professional. Of course. Now get out of here before I change my mind. All right. Thanks, boss. And don't call me boss. You got it, boss. Heh, heh. How many times do I have to tell you, Simon? Don't leave your good sportcoat lying around? No. Carla, what the hell are you doing? You told me you were clean. I am clean. Then what the hell are those? They're not mine. Is it so important for you to play football that you're going to put that steroid crap in your body again? Well, is it? Hey, listen, these are not mine. They don't even look like steroids. Now, where did you find them? In your sportcoat. What sportcoat. How many sportcoats do you have there, Mr. Trump? Wait a minute. From the night that Ben was killed? What do you mean? Come here. You got so thin. DET. Let's get started. Testing, one, two. Testing, one, two. Check. Coming through here. I'm trying again. You're not getting me? That's right, you have an adjustment. Come here. Man. Stop screwing around, Scotty. OK, now it's 15 minutes, in and out. We're looking for three pills. Check the medicine cabinets, first aid kits, any small hiding areas. Split up when you get in. And don't forget, if Simon shows, he has Navy SEAL training, so do not... Scotty... do not confront. Let's gear up. 'Tis the season, boys. I got these especially for you. Santa's misfit elves. All right, stand by for satellite imaging. We're in. - Good. Proceed. Go down. Go downstairs. All right, boys, party's over. Grab your kits and get the hell out. Scotty. What the hell you doing? Come on, abort! I'm gonna make you something when we get it in. Scotty's still in there. Did you leave the door open? No. What's wrong. Stay outside. Take her and stay outside. Hey, hey, hey! Let's play with the SEAL. Hey, man. This about that night with Mrs. Claus? Christ. All right. Now let's find out who's been naughty or nice? Awh! Let's go. Are you all right? Hello, Research and Development, can I help you? I'm sorry. Who have I reached? Research and Development Department, Stroyker Pierson Pharmaceuticals. Who are you calling for, please? Wrong number, sorry. You have to do that here? Doc said change it every six hours. It's six hours. So what'd the cops tell you? Says probably just kids. You believe it? Well, one of them said SEAL, as in Navy SEAL. They also knew the only way to take me out was by smashing my bad knee. So I think they knew exactly who they were dealing with and exactly what they were looking for. And what was that? These. OK, Scoop. What are they? I have no idea. I think Ben might have passed them to me the night of Hallie's memorial. Remember Holt said that Ben tried to pass her some pills? Cops said they were speedballs. Yeah, but what if they weren't? You still have your friend up in chemistry, right, Luigi? Loygue. So? You think he might want to do you a favor, or us a favor? Find out what those pills really are? Now you're starting to sound like a real reporter. Can I borrow your car? You're really pushing it. Thank you. So where the hell are you going? First I want to see your buddy Luigi. Then I'm going fishing. Here. Conspiracies are always less dangerous when more people know 'em. I only left you one pill, so don't lose it. Hey, Nancy Drew, don't get too tied up chasing clues. Your anniversary is tonight. That's right. Thank you. So you didn't find anything? No, not yet. Ran out of time. I came home. You're not sure he's clean? No, I'm not. Good. I like suspicious minds. Favorite Elvis song. Well, you know what the good thing about a reporter is, don't you? They don't know how to keep their mouths shut. We'll find out what he knows. I hope so. The safety of this research facility depends on it. The lab's closed. Come back later. I'm Simon Tate. Didn't Norm call you and say I was coming? Yes. You're the one who found some old Tylenol, something like that. Yeah, something like that. Here. Where did you get this? I'm not sure. Well, you're not supposed to have it. Why not? Here, look. See the X? Yeah. That's a pharmaceutical code, experimental, purely phase I. Phase I? Research and test production of a small amount of a new drug, phase I. What would be phase II? Probably testing on a control group. Nathan, phase II. What? Nothing. So you're gonna analyze that and, let us know? Sure. - Right. Thanks, Luigi. Jocks. Hello? Hey, baby, how's the clean-up going? Fine. I'm just getting ready for tonight. Why, what's tonight? Yeah, keep it up, and you're gonna assure yourself a year with no nookie. Heheh, no, no, I'm just kidding. Hey, listen, I'm on the trail of a story that Norm has me on. And? And I'm going to be home just a little bit later than I thought. Hello? OK. But you better be home by 8:00. I will. I promise. I love you. Love you, too. Just don't be late. Heh, heh, OK. Mommy, what's nookie? Because of the monumental breakthroughs made by Stroyker Pierson Pharmaceuticals in the treatment of those afflicted with the AIDS virus, it is now my honor, on behalf of the Senate of the United. States, to dedicate this Stroyker Pierson. Research Wing of NEU Hospital. Thank you. And now I'd like to introduce Dr. Karl Dean, the head of research. As head of research and development for Stroyker. Pierson, I guarantee this wing will continue to bolster. Stroykers all-important AIDS research until the day when treatments are no longer necessary... That glorious day when a cure is found. Thank you. You all remember... vote Holt. How you doing? Howdy. Welcome to Don's Bait and Brew. What can I do you for? I was hoping you could help me out. I'm a reporter. I was looking for somebody named Nathan. Phase II, does that ring a bell. Phase II? Sure, we can help ya. You guys, I don't want any trouble. Hey, no trouble at all, pal. See I said I didn't want any trouble at all, and you guys just... God. Get him up there. Where's the wire? I don't have a wire. - Where's the wire? I'm not wearing one. I thought I told you already. I'm Simon Tate, a reporter. - Yeah, right. Who are you? - I'm Simon... I'll make him talk. Stop. Get back upstairs. No. Who did he say he is? Says he's a reporter. From where? New England University. Check him for ID. If he doesn't have any, kill him. It's... it's in my back pocket... in my back pocket. Simon Tate, journalism student, New England University. Let him go. Simon Tate the football player? Yeah, the football player. I always like watching you play, Simon. I'm Nathan. No hard feelings? No, man. No hard feelings. Who are those guys, family members? God, no. More like white trash Secret Service. I must be out of my mind talking to you. Why? Are you in trouble? You don't think I actually enjoy locking myself up in this dusty old attic, do you? What do you want? OK, what's Phase II? I'm Phase II. So is Hallie, and a few others. So you knew Hallie? Not directly. Phase II colleague. But Hallie knew Roanic. You're smarter than you look, Simon. I am. What's this? That there, Simon, is life. If you don't get rid of it it will be your death. What do you mean, it's life? You have to go. What do you mean, it's life? If you're really doing a story about Doc, you might want to ask Diana Holt. She knew her daughter had AIDS. What? Nothing. Goodbye, Simon. Richard, you know the workings of the strikers pretty well, don't you? Pretty well, I... Have you heard of Phase II? Phase II. Should I? Well I don't know. It's something I found in Hallie's stuff, an invoice that said Phase II. A Striker invoice? No, no. But it had a Striker number on it. Well you're not giving me much to go on, but I'll ask around if you like. No, it's probably nothing. Didn't you and your little gang of jolly pirates get everything out of Hallie's apartment? Well, we were obviously pressed for time. Well, maybe you can find the time to tell me why a senatorial candidate is asking questions about Phase II? I suggest you and your men find out what the hell was going on around here before we end up on the evening news. I'm about ready to put you out of my misery. Give me a status bar on the entire 717 area code. If someone mentions finding or taking anything stronger than an aspirin, I want to know. Can I help you? Yes, sir. I'm writing an article on Dr. Benjamin Roanic, and it concerns his relationship with Hallie Marie Holt, and I was wondering... Get out of here, you bloodsucker. Sir, please. I'm hot on the trail. I don't care what you're hot onto. Ms. Holt has been under a lot of pressure, and she has a campaign to run. You can either get out here under your own steam or I'll call the authorities. Richard, who is it? It's some reporter digging the dirt. Ms. Holt, I need to talk to you about your daughter. He's just leaving, Diana. Please, I'm a friend of Dr. Roanic's. I really appreciate you seeing me. Thank you. Listen, son, Ms. Holt's been under a lot of pressure these last couple of weeks, and your being here does not exactly help her state of mind, so why don't you do us all a favor, cut to the chase, and tell us exactly what it is you want. Yes, sir. I'm writing a story on Dr. Benjamin Roanic, and well, my... My research tells me that Dr. Roanic and Hallie knew each other prior to her murder. No. No, that's not true. Well, I have a source that says that they knew each other specifically from a program called Phase II. Phase II? Who's your source? You know I can't reveal that, senator, but my source also tells me that, well, before she was murdered, that Hallie may have contracted the AIDS virus. Are you crazy? Who's your source, son? I don't mean to get you upset. I just need to get... What you need to get... You need to get a cheap shot? Another attempt to clear your friend's name, no matter who it might hurt? You people are all the same. Just get out of here before I throw you out. No, that's not the kicker. All right, kid. What's the kicker? That Nathan kid told me that Hallie had AIDS. Norm? That's an All-Pro kicker. Yeah, well, something tells me those pills are the cause of all this trouble. Speaking of trouble, aren't you supposed to be attending an anniversary dinner about now. My god. Carla's going to kill me. Thanks, Norm. Gotcha. Yes, yes, yes. My God. Hallie. Come on. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up, Carla. That had better be you, Simon Tate. Hello. Son of a bitch. Yeah, man. You are mine. Checkmate, Mr. Tate. Shit. What are you doing? What are you doing? No. No no no. Scotty. Honey, I'm so sorry. You have a lovely family, Mr. Tate. What the hell is going on here? Come here. Take him. Take him, Rich. Why does it always have to be the knee? Get him out of here. All right, come on. Come on. All right. Get up. Details are sketchy, but what we know is former football star Simon Tate was arrested at his home this morning. Mr. Tate is the prime suspect in the murder of NEU senior editor Norman Pringle. Sources say Tate had a disagreement with Pringle in regards to... I didn't do this. Writing about the death of... I didn't do this. Roanic. When authorities searched the Tate residence, they found two five-gallon drums of mega-android, an anabolic steroid popular with Eastern European athletes. And in other campus news, chemist Chuck Loyghue was found in the burning remains of the university chemistry building. Authorities say the lab ignited while Loyghue was experimenting... They set all this up, man. They're killing people. Really? Did you have fun last night, sport? Well, your fun's about to be over, permanently. Authorities will be here in the morning to transport Mr. Tate upstate. Make sure you keep an eye on him at all times. Yes, sir. A 49-year-old unidentified man was... You know those things can kill you. Well I love them anyway. So how's your new guest? Well, he went kicking and screaming, just like a woman. What's this? The editor gave it to me on his last breath. Don's Bait and Brew. Turn it over. Nathan, Phase II. Unfortunately we're still missing one pill. I'm sure you know how to handle this. One more. You know, I promised myself if I ever saw my husband in jail, he wouldn't be my husband anymore. Honey, it's difficult to explain, but I want you to go to your parents' house, OK. It's not safe here. It's not safe because my husband is a murder suspect. Carla, I did not kill Norm. OK? These people are setting me up. They can get inside the house. It is not safe. Please, Carla, you have to trust me one more time. OK. I guess you're going to miss our dinner again. Howdy welcome to Don's Bait and Brew. What can I do you for, guys? Hey, you got a visitor. Can we be left alone, please? I need to know who told you that Roanic and Hallie were friends. I can't do that, not while I'm in here. Well they were right. They there... they were friends. You have to believe me when I tell you that Ben did not kill Hallie, just like I did not kill Norm. Now I can take you to my source. Who is it? I'll take you to him. I promise. How are you going to take me anywhere? I can get out of this cell. I just need to know that there's going to be someone outside to help me once I am out. I got nothing to lose. OK, they're transferring me in the morning, and something tells me I'm not going to get there. Simon Tate, I have no idea how you're going to get out of here, but I'll be waiting in the campus back lot... One hour, in a black Towncar. No pain, no gain. Damn. What are you crying about? My knee, man. Damn athletes' injuries. You're always falling apart. Shh. Quiet. You know what they say about us guys on steroids, you know. We're really edgy. Where is Tate? He just escaped. What? I ought to shoot you myself for letting him go. Hey, what about me? Let me out of here. Hey! I wasn't sure you'd make it. Piece of cake. I can't believe I'm doing this. Trust me. Nathan? My God, Nathan. Did something... what happened? Where are your men? The Angel of Death took them. Nice rig? Set to blow my balls straight through my ears as soon as I stand up. Diana Holt, Hallie's mom. So you know your little daughter had AIDS. All right, Nathan. We're going to get you some help, OK. Don't bother. Look over there. It's set for a fire. God. Simon, just wait. Just let it go. Roanic didn't kill Hallie. He cared for her. He thought she was great. Who was Roanic's favorite out of the five of us? Five of you? Yeah. Jordan, killed in a skiing accident. Samantha OD'ed. James, car accident. Hallie, killed by a stalker, and yours truly, blown up by a faulty hot water heater. Nathan, why? You see, Roanic, he was the doctor who oversaw our supposed experimental vitamin treatments. They called it Phase II. Why would they kill the test subjects? Didn't... didn't the drugs work? They work. That's the problem. They work too well. What do you mean? Hallie's autopsy say she had AIDS? No. Do you know why? Because she didn't have it anymore, just like my autopsy won't mention it either. That's why they killed us. The good people at Stroyker Pierson pharmaceuticals, where do you think they got their money? AIDS treatment medications. AIDS treatment, not cures... Pills that you have to take over and over again, sometimes two and three at a time... $200 for a bottle of 50. They were getting rich on treating the symptoms. You think they'd really release a drug that could cure. AIDS in less than 10 pills? They're in the Band-Aid business, Diana. They're not in the cure business. Roanic says all the files are at some top secret laboratory up at Striker. Diana, go outside and get some help. No, we can't leave him here. You two get the hell out of here. Tate! - What? There's four. What? - Phases. I'm Phase II. Roanic said there were four phases. Now just go, please. No, no, Nathan. Yeah, we have to go. Come on. All right, let's get out of here. Are you all right? He was just a boy. How many more innocent kids have to die? The forecast, cloudy and windy... Do you have children? Yeah, yeah. Kayla. Three years, and 30 pounds of unholy terror. She's beautiful. Yeah. Outside of my wife, she's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Are you a good dad? Yeah, I guess I am. You make sure you let her know how proud you are of her, even if you're angry. With the wind out of the north at 19... It's more important than you know. Hey, turn that up. OK, I promise. And now, breaking news. Police have issued an all points bulletin for NEU student Simon Tate. Tate escaped from a holding cell while awaiting transport to a detention facility located upstate. Authorities are saying at this point he should be considered armed and dangerous... We'd better get out of here. Anyone who's seen him to contact local police immediately. Next up, local weather with Britney Ivigovitz. Ma'am. Are you going to be moving soon? Plumb near impossible to find a parking spot around here. Yes. Right now. Thank you, ma'am. Nice car. Yeah, I think we got him. Holt's car was ID'ed north of town, just off the highway. I'm on my way to intercept them. - Good. I'm going to put an extra ace up our sleeve, just in case we need it. I'm through playing games with this jockstrap. Let's go. Miss, may I speak to you for a minute? I have reason to believe that the substances found in your home may have been stolen from our facility and planted in your basement. So he was set up. By who? But if you will allow me and my colleague to come inside, I'll explain everything. OK. Tate, get out of the car. It's over! Come on. Hurry up. Son of a bitch. You sure you want to do this? Don't you worry about me. I'll be fine. You just worry about getting into that lab. And take this. And call me as soon as you're in the clear. Thank you. Thank me when this is all over. Good luck. Please, please, you have to help me. Yeah. Are you OK? Simon Tate, he tried to kill me. Simon Tate, where is he? He took off. He took off down the street, over there. Gosh. My goodness. Don't worry, ma'am. Would you like to lay down inside? No. No, no, no, I just need to... To rest, out here, just for a moment. Please stay with me. Diana. Richard. Diana, what happened? I was so scared. Come on, let's get you home. Well, you know Karl Dean, right? Yes. Hello. Hello, Diana. He'd just like to ask you a few questions about Simon Tate. Richard, what is going on? Friends shouldn't have secrets from each other, Diana. Especially not when they're in politics together. Come on, there's got to be something here. There is something here. Hey, man, what's going on? Hey, you wouldn't happen to know anything about Phase III, would you? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I would. You see, I'm Phase III, termination of the cure and elimination all of its problems. And guess what, Mr. Tate, you have been its biggest problem. Man, can't we just be friends? I mean, I... I haven't done anything to you, right? You know something, you're right. You know, I never did get a chance to get acquainted. See, I'm having fun now. That was for Scotty. This is for me. Enough fun. Argh! Yeah, it hurts, doesn't it? Giyah. Gohh! Diana, you are not going to believe... Wrong. But who is this? It's not important. What's important is who this is. Talk to Daddy. Daddy? Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn? Not any more. Who is this? I swear to God, man, whoever... What, if I harm one golden hair on her innocent little head? Why don't you just shut up and can the bravado, and maybe you'll have a chance to save your daughter's life. Well? Yes. Good. Now, you have something of ours. The pill. The pill. We want it back. It's a fair trade, your family for the pill. OK, I have to get it first though. NEU football field, one hour. - Perfect. Mr. Tate? Yeah. Just let's make sure we understand each other. If you do anything, anything, I promise you, the next time you pick up your little girl, you'll be holding handles on a polished wooden box. Understand? Yeah. Good. Simon Tate? In the flesh. What's the matter, cream-puff? You hurt? Old football injury. It's still not going to stop me from sticking this crutch so far up your ass you look like a corn dog. That's enough. You boys can play later. Now bring the pill to me, and we can all be on our way. My family first. No. Bring the pill to me. No. Tch. Let me talk to whoever is in charge. You're talking to the person in charge. Yeah, right. Nobody be stupid enough to put you in charge of anything. OK. Give me the pill now or die. Come on, you kill me, and you'll never get your precious little pill. We'll see about that. That's enough. There's no need to get personal. Senator, you're behind this? Mr. Tate, I prefer to be considered as the man in front of all this. Hey. Hi, sweetheart. How are you? They're fine. You can have them back if you give me the pill. Senator, you know, I... I think I've figured out Phase III, elimination of any possible cure you might have accidentally discovered during Phase II. Wow-how, you really are working hard at breaking that dumb jock stereotype. Look, I just got to know, what is Phase IV? I'm a very busy man, Mr. Tate. I really don't have time for this. Why not? I mean, I know you're going to kill me anyway. I'm marked for Phase III. OK, Phase IV. Phase IV is the status quo. The world thinks that Stroyker is working day and night on a cure. And we continue to make millions on treatments. We start over on Phase I. We introduce new experimental drugs. Everybody's happy. Phase IV is the state of mind that we all live in in this world. We buy everything that's advertised to us. And we believe exactly what the media tells us. All right, so what's in it for you, Senator? Son, it is not cheap to hold an office like mine. We need money and support to excel. And as a primary stockholder in Stroyker, I won't be eating cat food in my golden years. Now why don't you give me the pill, and we'll return to the status quo? What about mankind? Screw mankind. Just give me the pill before I kill your family. My family first. Get the kid. Get the kid! For god's sakes, no. Get back! Get back! OK, Mr. All-Star, you give me the pill, or you'll be able to see daylight through your daughter's head. All right, fine! Just don't hurt her, OK? What is this? What are you doing? Shit. Kaitlyn, get inside the car! Get off the field! Daddy! Kaitlyn. No! Hiyah. Agh! Are you guys OK? Yeah. - OK? Yeah. Really? Gee. Simon? OK. OK. How did I do? You did good. You did real good, Diana. Look, Simon, I want you to go to Hallie's grave for me. No, you go yourself, OK? Sweetheart, call an ambulance. I just wanted to thank you again. You don't have to thank me. You would have done the same thing. Maybe. I just need some time to tell Hallie how proud I am of her. Of course. You go right ahead and do that. I will. Although, I'm sure she probably already knows. Yeah. But I'd like to tell her anyway. Well, thanks again.
