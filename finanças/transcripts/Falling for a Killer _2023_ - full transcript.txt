Tom. Thomas! Is everything okay, honey? No. No, I wanted to meet the girls, so I thought I'd take the Jag, and then I found this in the center console. - Ah. - Ah? You wanna tell me why you have a life insurance policy on me that I know nothing about? Honey, it's a great investment, especially while we're young. Honey, a guy came to the office a few weeks ago. He sold one to everyone here. I even took one out on myself. You did? - What is going on with you? - I don't know. I'm sorry. You know I can be silly sometimes. That's part of the reason why I love you so much. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you too. Hey, why don't I finish up here real quick and then I can meet you at home for a nice quiet night in. I'd love that. Let me walk you out. Thanks, babe. I think once is enough. No, with these newer elevators, they have this whole operating cheat system. If you hit the buttons in the right order, you can get them to do just about anything. This is fascinating. I figured you wanted to get out of here fast. Yeah, and how did you learn this? Do you think I'm actually in there working? No, I'm on Wikipedia all day. You're telling me your trade secrets. That should do it. Come here, beautiful. Yeah? What? Mm. And what about the cameras? They don't install those out here for a few more weeks. Oh. Mm. Wow. Mrs. Baugh. Mr. Baugh. You know, they do make cheeses that don't come in a can, right? The can seals in the flavor. Mm. So I was thinking about the Hargrove case. - Oh, nope. - And they're really... We are not talking about work. We have three days outside of that office, so we're not even gonna think about it. - Yes, but I really. - Nope, nope. Seriously, if you even say the word law, I will literally throw you out of here. Um, this is my place. And you have more closet space, so don't tempt me. Okay, fine. I won't talk about work. I'm meeting my sister's fiancé. Wait, you're meeting your sister's fiancé? Yeah, see, this is why I didn't wanna talk about it. Oh. No one in my family has met him, and we'll all be stuck at the country house all weekend. Plus. Plus what? Well, she's your younger sister, right? You don't think that I care that my little sister's getting married before me, do you? My younger sister got engaged like two weekends before my older sister, and it almost ended in gunfire. Okay, well, I don't care. I don't. Right, yeah, you're married to Lady Justice. So funny. No, once I'm DA then I can think about settling down. Oh, well, why not just wait until you're Attorney General? Well, it's not like I haven't thought about it. Okay, that is insane. This is so stupid. They're your family. Just... Just stop being such a baby and go in there. You guys are so funny! You need to leave him alone. So anyway, to finish the story. 54 years ago, this woman said to me, "If you'll make the living, I'll make the living worthwhile." And you know, I did. Oh, it looks like we have company. Oh my God, you came! I'm so happy you came. Let me look at you. You look tired. We should get colonics later! Okay. Oh, I'm so happy you came. Of course I came. You know, just with Daddy. Well, you know, some things are more important than grudges. Darcy, good of you to make it. Late, but still. Or maybe not. Hi, Daddy. Sorry, I had some work to finish up this morning. Hi, Mom. Well, hello, dear. You know, if you'd have come to work for me, you'd have been able to bill every single hour this morning. Daddy, enough. You can be passive aggressive later. Darcy, may I present... Honey, please, let me. Thomas. Thomas Schure. Look. Oh my. It is beautiful! And you can't say no to a thing like that, right? It just helps that I love him too. Darcy, are you gonna sit or should I get you a pad and pen and you can take our drink orders? Oh! Daddy! You have to be nice. Did I just hear you guys laughing back here? Yes, you did. As it turns out, Thomas and I had the same professor at Yale. Professor Johanna Selmer. Wow. You guys shared a professor? Mmhmm. Yeah. But then the young lad went to Wharton. When Yale Law was right there. Penn. I know. A safety school. Ooh. Oh. I'm sorry. Say that again. Uh-oh. A safety school? Say it one more time. Safety school! Ah, ah, no, no! Oh, no, no, okay, okay, okay! Oh, oh no, oh no, okay. I give, I give. Stop it, stop it! I give, I give, I give. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I give, I give, I give. I give, I give, I give, I give! All right, all right, all right, all right. Okay, okay, truce, truce, truce. All right, come on up, come on up. - Oh, I love you, brother. Aw. - I love you, Dad. Did you hear him call me Dad? I did, that is so sweet. I see where you get it from. - Safety school! - Oh, okay! We're goin', we're goin'! No, no! Oh, dear me. You're only here for two nights. Yeah. So why are you unpacking? Didn't you only bring like three things anyway? I like my clothes in drawers. There are two types of people in this world, Darcy. People who leave their stuff in their bags and sociopaths. If Thomas would've done that when we first met, I would've been right out the door. And how exactly did you meet Tom? Thomas. He really doesn't like his name shortened. Speaking of sociopathic behavior... Not fair! Remember when Aunt Marjorie started calling me Bea? It was so annoying. Man, you've got it bad. So really, how did it all go down? You want the whole story? All the details. Ooh. All the details? Mm-hmm. So you want to hear about sex on the beach or in the lifeguard stand? Or when the resort staff caught us in the hotel linen closet? Ugh, okay, maybe just the PG version. Buy you a drink? - Yeah. - Eeh! Ew. What? Your vegan death sludge. It's healthy. Ooh, and very expired. Yeah, because no one but you is dumb enough to drink it. Just the iced tea for me. I thought you were my older sister, not my old sister. Ouch, okay, fine, but like just a splash. Yeah. Okay, are you trying to outdo Mom? Mom is taking a nap while the help her rich husband hired cleans up breakfast. If I get half as far as she did, I'll be happy. Yeah, well, seems like you're on your way. Right? I don't know how rich he is, but I know it's rich, rich. Like the kind of rich that hires Daddy when they need help. Aw. It's true love! I'm not shallow. His body's pretty tight, too. Darce... I really do love him. Okay, so how did it happen? So I was on a beach trip with my girlfriends, and he rose up out of the ocean, like I made a wish or something, and just walked right over to me and introduced himself. We went out dancing. And by nine o'clock that night, I knew it would take the jaws of life to make me let go of him. He was by himself? For business, Ms. Suspicious. Anyway, we just talked that first night. Mm-hmm. Okay, but we talked a lot after! It was amazing. We liked all the same bands, all the same movies. He even wears a crystal to keep himself balanced. He believes in crystals? Mm-hmm. I found the only guy without a smelly hippie beard who does. Okay, so this guy, he appears out of nowhere and just so happens to like all the same stuff as you. Oh my God. You've spent way too much time as a cop. I'm an Assistant DA. Same difference. Look, I'm just saying that people can go through your social media. They can find out what... Shows what you know! He doesn't even have a social media. Brea, I am happy for you. You are? I am. Awesome. For a second there, I thought you weren't gonna come to the party. Wait, party? Yeah. Daddy wants to introduce Thomas to some of his friends. Darce, please don't do that thing where you isolate yourself on the front yard while everyone else is partying. I won't. And it's not Darce, it's Darcy. See how annoying that is? See how annoying that is? If you'd excuse me, my fiancé is waiting. Oh. - Bye! - Bye. There we go. And that was it, he just hit it? No, he sent me to jail. Oh, hi, baby. Oh, hi. Are you two getting along? He was just telling me about the time that they took him to jail! Brea thought you might be out here. Now, my father's friends are so much fun to hang around with. Did you get any good golf stories? There was a gripping tale of a par five eagle. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I don't mean to be antisocial. I'm just getting... Some work done? Brea had an inkling. I guess Justice never sleeps. It naps occasionally. Yeah, of course you work hard. Harvard undergrad, which I can't imagine Douglass was impressed by. And then Yale Law, which is what you were expected to do, but then you didn't join your father's firm. You decided to go the other way. Put people behind bars. And from what I hear, if you don't make DA before 40, a lot of people in the city are gonna lose a lot of bets. You writing an article about me? I googled you. It's impressive, really. What would I find if I googled you? - Oh, I'm not that interesting. - Oh. But you, you're all over it. With the Hargrove case and the Kinkaid thing. And then there was that whole Halston mess from a few years back. That was huge news. I was only a part of the team. Well, the newspapers, they put you square in the center of it all. And so does your dad. My dad is a lot of things, but interested in my career he is not. Oh, come on, Darce. I think you're being way too hard on Dad. Sorry, that's just weird to hear. It's okay, no worries. You really should hear him in there. He's needling all of his friends who lost to you in court. And trust me, there's a lot of 'em. The man may not say it, but he is very proud of you. Hey, let me show you something. Here in the office. Shouldn't you be getting back to Brea? Well, you're gonna wanna see this. And she did ask us to spend some quality time together, Sis. Look on the wall. He took it down from my room. He may be a tough man, Darce, but he brags about you when you're not around. You should see, he has more of your stuff in his desk. Oh, hey. Sorry, I thought this was the kitchen. Well, it's clearly not. It's fine, the kitchen is just down the hall. Thanks, been a long day. It's a big house. Oh my God, dude! I'm so sorry. Let me help. And it's sir. Huh? Not dude. You look like you killed someone. Well, the only thing murdered today was my suit. Oh. Well, maybe we should take you upstairs, and I'll help you get changed. Oh, I like that. Oh, okay, that's my cue. Oh my God, Darcy. I didn't even see you there. I'm so embarrassed. No, you're not. Wait, look at you two bonding! Give me your phone, let me take a picture. - No. - No. And now you're ganging up on me? Ah! We're like a real family now! Oh my God, let me take you to Daddy. He'll think this is hilarious. Honey. Honey, I... Honey. I just think it sucks you guys left without me. I was in the bathroom. Well, that's how long it takes. I'm just saying, next job you do the cleanup. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! You know I probably would've let you live if you called me sir. My dad says manners are the difference between men and savages. Yeah. Now I look like a killer. I hope you can swim, dude. Baby, it's insane o'clock in the morning. When did you come to bed last night? I, uh... I don't remember. But you were, you were out cold. I just wanted to get an early start on the day. I had a killer night of sleep. Okay. You want to join me? I guess a shower would wake me up. Wow, future Mrs. Schure. Mr. Schure. Get in here. Hey, so full disclosure, I am using your place. For what? - For the barista. - Amanda! Oh, not for that, for the shower. The landlord is fixing mine, again. So we're gonna leave you a bag of Egyptian beans. It's all good. Okay, fine. Look, I have a big favor. My sister's fiancé, I can't find anything about him on the internet. Like what, no Facebook? Well, that's all the red flags flying all at once, huh? Yeah. I know it's a big ask, but do you think you could go down to the office and see if we have any records for a Thomas Schure? Well, I guess I do owe you one for the shower and for the wine stain on the rug. Wait, what? Like I said, I owe you one. I will get down there this afternoon. Thank you. And Darce, seriously, if you're getting bad vibes from this guy, please be careful. Let's figure out what's going on before we make him mad, okay? Yeah, I will be. I mean, I'm probably just being overly protective, right? I hope so. Yeah, me too. Okay, thank you. Bye. Something in yellow and pink for bridesmaids? - Yellow and pink? - You two are up early. Oh, we got up early to go to church, dear. You went to church? You went to church? It was Thomas's idea. He doesn't like to miss a week if he doesn't have to. Sweet, sweet boy. Mom, he's 40. A young 40! Right, now don't be jealous of your sister, dear. I'm not. You don't think that I'm jealous. Don't blame yourself, dear. Anyone would be. You know, I think I'm a bit jealous of you myself. I'm jealous of myself sometimes. Right! Well, I am not jealous. I'm happy that you're happy because that's all I ever wanted. And I am perfectly at peace with where I am and what I'm doing, okay? Now, honey, it's been a while since I've studied Shakespeare, but I think the quote is, "Methinks thy lady doth protest too much." Mom, I just wanna thank you again. - Of course, dear, yes. - Wait, thank her for what? Oh, well, we're paying for their wedding at the Bower House. The Bower House? That's where your father and I were married. Yeah. No, I know, but isn't that... - Yeah, well. - A lot of money? It is. The price has gone up a little bit, but hey, it's worth it. And if your wedding is anything like mine, I'll have grandchildren within the year! Oh, gross. Mom. But speaking of grandbabies, your father and I, we think that we should give you your wedding money now. Wow, Mom, thank you. Thank you for that vote of confidence. No, it's not that I don't want to see you married. I do, but... I have to be realistic. Maybe you could use the money to go on a cruise! Mom, I'm not in my 70s! Don't you like cruises? Oh, hey, Baby! What are you doing? I'm just gonna clean it. Unless you want to. Darcy, he and Dad are going hunting. Darcy, I think you owe Thomas an apology. Now, Mom. We just sat through an entire sermon talking about walking in other people's shoes. Darce is around bad people all day long. She sees someone with a gun, what else is she gonna think? You... You have a good point, Thomas. Darce, if I really wanted to hurt you, I would've cooked you breakfast. You want me to get you a blindfold? I don't wanna show off too much. I really am sorry I overreacted. Brea is still fuming. It's all right, I'll talk to her. Calm her down. I am right though, aren't I? About all the bad guys you deal with? I guess. Must be hard being around all that scum. No, that's the job. I just try not to make it personal. Come on. It's gotta be satisfying to put those monsters behind bars. Like Halston? Must've been thrilled when you heard what happened to him. What happened to him? You don't know? Uh, no, honestly, I don't. Why, did he get hurt or something? Darcy, it was all over the news. Strangled, piano wire, in his cell. And the guards, well, they were... They were somewhere not there. But I mean, you put him there. Must be gratifying to hear what happened to him. No. No, it's sad. I want them punished, but I don't want them killed. It's the same difference. Is it? Darcy! Darcy, get in the office! My dad, always the polite one. That's Yale for you. Oh, one question. Were you in the military or something? Is this your way of making fun of my haircut? No. Where'd you learn to clean a gun like that? You know, I pick things up from all over. Well, I'm really curious. If I give you all my secrets, what are we gonna talk about at Thanksgiving? Okay then. Dad? Where's my duck call? You think I took your duck call? I think you moved my duck call. Dad, I assure you I have no interest in your duck call. Hey, Dad, I just wanna say that's nice that you would display it like that. That was a good night. The banquet. I was so proud of you. Was? I didn't think you were the needy type. I ask you if you're proud of me once in my life, and all of a sudden I'm needy? You were a wonderful field hockey player, happy? I'd be happier if you weren't speaking in the past tense. What do you want me to say, Darcy? You're a good prosecutor, but every time I hear about one of your victories, it's just an unpleasant reminder that you stabbed me in the back. I changed my mind. You were supposed to come to work for me! That was the arrangement! Dad, it's been 10 years! And besides, plans change. You always gotta be right. Well, I'm your daughter. I don't want to be late for hunting, Earl's meeting us... That's weird. I always keep this locked. Do you think that maybe somebody at the party was looking through your desk? That's preposterous. I mean, it was just friends and family last night. Yeah, but some friends and family we know less well than others. Dad, I think maybe Thomas isn't who... Here it is! Huh? Check that baby out, refinished it last year. Good talk. Thanks for the help. Earl! Woo! I hope this lake of yours is close by, Young. Dear Lord, man. Try eating a salad from time to time. Now where's this brand-new son-in-law to be of yours, huh? You know, he really is a remarkable young man. Speak of the devil! - And he appears. - Yes, sir. I can't wait to get out there. You must be Earl. Nice to make your acquaintance. We met before? Very doubtful. My God, you look so familiar. I don't know what to tell you. I have a pretty standard face, look like the other guys. Right, Douglass? Gentlemen, shall we? Let's get in the truck. Let's go! I got back seat! Dibs on back! - Oh, okay, okay. - No, no, no, no, no! So he takes it before the grand jury. - Playing to the public. - Always. And he's looking at me like it means something. DAs, god. Darcy excluded, of course. Of course. Of course. Hi. Darcy! Yeah. We need to talk. Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help? No, no, no, you're a guest. I defended you, didn't I? When you were a teenager. I'm sorry. Again, not to be rude, I've never been in court. Are you positive? You weren't Thomas then. You went by Tommy, Tommy Halston. I'd never go by Tommy. My last name is Schure. Thomas Schure. Sorry, you're just wrong, sir. Earl, you senile old fool. You don't know him, that's the end of it. - Sorry, my mistake. - Come on! - My brain. - Yeah, your brain's soaked in scotch! Now come on down here, young man. Let's go have some fun. Serious parts of your brain are missing. It's fossilized. Let me hear you quack! - Quack, quack, quack. - Quack, quack... Ah, you're the man! Oh, Earl, you're the man! Well, come on! 100 bucks for the first duck! You had me at $100! Good to have you with us. Oh, thanks, Dad. Let's go have some fun. He's my husband. He's your fiancé. I can't have my sister treating him like he's some kind of villain. Brea, I'm not... Darcy, please. We've always been on the same team. Do you remember my 16th birthday when I got my butterfly tattoo? I thought they were gonna burn it off with a fireplace poker. But you were home from law school, and you stood between Mom and Dad and me. You stared them down before they stopped yelling. You were always my ally. I still am. Well, then can you please act like it? Stop going after Thomas. Just make him feel welcome. For me? Okay. Thank you. I thought you were gonna make me choose. Dad, are you okay? Thomas... Thomas... What about Thomas? Is he all right? He's the best shot I've ever seen! He's good, Daddy? Oh, better than good, baby. I mean, it was like the man had a blood feud with waterfowl. Oh, it's gonna be all you can eat duck tonight. Who's helping me get 'em ready? Huh? Dibs, not it. It's Darcy then. Grab some gloves, meet me around back. What happened to allies? I draw the line at feather plucking. Oh, you're such a... What does that mean? It means you should have learned ASL! Well, I can practice while you are ripping out entrails. Oh, look at what we got here! I'm gonna need to start plucking that. Earl, pay the man his 100. There we go. That's what I'm talking about. Don't say I never did anything for you. I was close, I should have killed him. I should have killed him! Hi, Martin. Yeah, no, sorry to call you on a long weekend. Hey, listen, I just spoke with my fiancé today. She wants us to pull the trigger on the life insurance policy as soon as possible and get it signed before the end of the long weekend. I totally get that, totally get that. Hey, listen, why don't we tack on the fire and home insurance as well. Anything you got, what do you say? I don't know how much easier it is. I can put money in your pocket. What do you say? I'll overnight it. I'll, I'll, I'll pay for the overnight. I'll text you the address right now. Good? Marty, we good? Good, great. Okay, thanks. Yep, bye, I'll do it right now. Bye, bye, bye. Fine, it's fine. It's fine, it's fine. We're off schedule, but it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Would you like to lead us in grace, Dad? Thomas, why don't you take this one? I would be honored. Thank you. Let's be thankful that God makes some of us hunters and some of us prey. As it says in Ecclesiastes, "No one knows when their hour will come. "As fish get caught in a cruel net or birds "trapped in a snare, so people get trapped by evil times." Let's be happy that on this day, evil fell upon the bird. Amen! - Amen. - Amen, thank you. Let's eat. Cell phones at the dinner table, really? It's work, I'm sorry. I'll be right back, excuse me. Work on a Sunday night, can you even imagine? Should we wait to eat before she gets back? Oh, I think of course we should. - Hey. - Do you have any idea how difficult it is to entertain a 22-year-old barista at a DA's office on a Sunday afternoon? You're on a second date, already? Oh, we're still on the first one. He's like a little Energizer Bunny. Well, I'm sure you'll tell me all about it tomorrow. Mm, depends on if the date's still going. Listen, I couldn't find anything on this guy. If he was ever in the database, he paid someone pretty well to have himself scrubbed out of it. Oh gosh, that's actually a relief because... But I decided to do a little more digging and cross-referenced unsolved marital crimes with your description of the guy and... I got two pretty solid hits. I mean, honestly, I've never seen anything like it. He didn't miss once. Oh! Oh, no. No, no, you're gonna make me blush. No, Daddy, don't stop. I've never seen that. No, no more compliments from you, none. I'm telling you. I'm gonna be impossible to live with. - No. - But okay. Not to change the subject. Yeah, right. But I think I met your maid today? Oh, Kristina, lovely girl. Is that her name? Douglass, you are the worst! She's worked for us for years. She's a wonderfully helpful worker. You would never even know that she's impaired. Wow, Mom. I forgot to tell you that we traveled back to 1965 on the way over here. Oh. She's not impaired, she's hard of hearing. Well, she gets along remarkably well even so. She's a hell of a lip reader. She is. Lip reader? Of course, Darcy learned ASL. But the rest of us just enunciate. Kristina... I just swore her name was Isabella. - Oh, Douglass. - Oh my God! What? You do know my name, don't you? - Oh, sure. - Of course. It's... A little help, darling? Oh, come on! That's not even funny. Two years ago, a guy named Thomas Baugh lost his wife down an elevator shaft. Yeah, the car never showed up. I saw pictures in the file, it... Anyway, the guy waited until the insurance paid out and then disappeared. Same thing, three years ago, Thomas Snow. His wife drowned on their first anniversary snorkeling in Australia. The guy waited until the insurance paid out... Then disappeared. Okay, are there any pictures of these guys? That's the weird thing. Scrubbed. I'm guessing if it was an insurance scam, you gotta keep some record in the database. But if you were trying to link them, good luck. Darcy, you there? Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Amanda, I appreciate it. I'll investigate a little further on Tuesday, but this is all circumstantial, right? It's a substantial amount of circumstantial. No, I know, I know. Just, I just have to be really sure before I say anything, you know? Okay, honey, I don't think the bosses are going to appreciate the barista's artistic addition to the office. I will shoot these files over to you if you need to make a case to Brea. Okay, thank you. Bye. Okay, I gotta tell you about when I met the governor. What'd I miss? Dad is telling us the story of when he met the governor again. - Okay. - Hey, it's a good story! Come on. Darcy! Dad, we need at least three more bottles of wine before that story even approached good. Oh, we do. Nonsense, I was thoroughly enjoying it. My man. Teacher's pet. Okay, now that you're back, let's dig in. Yeah, food's getting cold. I mean, we got duck there. Our jaws are gonna get greasy. I mean, come on, let's go. I'd sure like to have some of that salad. Darcy, again? Really? It's just a text from Kristina. Okay. I am instituting a no phone policy at this dinner table. I agree with that. Darcy? I'm done. I'm done, phone's down. So anyway, the governor said to me, "I'd have used an eight iron." And I'm going, "No, man. "You get better penetration with the three wood." Oh, this looks so good. Oh, I hope it is. Darcy, would you like some duck? Sure. Hey! Hey, everyone, wake up! Someone call an ambulance! Help! Wake up, hurry! What happened? - I don't know. - Oh my gosh, Kristina. What happened? I don't know. You just found her like this? I came in from my walk outside and she was like this. Hey, hey, hey. Hi, hey, hey, what happened? What happened? What's going on? Hey, Kristina, what happened? Oh my God, Kristina! - What is it? - Oh! What happened? She was just here? Oh, no! Hey Dad, call an ambulance now. Yeah, yeah. - Honey. - Help is coming. Help is coming. Take a breath. Shh, shh, shh. Yeah. Bad... Bad? What, what happened? No quick, here, grab her hands, get her hands. Get her hands, get her hands! - No, we're... - Okay. Hold her hands tight, hold it tight. She's trying to tell us something. - She is going to hurt herself! - Darcy! Kristina, Kristina, stay with us, honey. Come on, come on. She's trying to tell us something. Darcy, move! Hold her tight, hold her tight! I got her right now, I got her right now. On their way... Come on, honey! Just hold her, hold her right there. It's enough! I can't stay quiet anymore. Can I speak to my family alone please? Thomas is family. Brea, you know what I mean! All right, this is important. Honey, it's okay. I can go upstairs. No, Darcy's just being dramatic even though we already talked about this. Apparently she doesn't care what I think. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, we've all been through a lot this morning. Just take a few deep breaths, relax, maybe get a bite to eat. And then let's talk about this when we're all calmed down. No, I have to say this now. I think Thomas Schure here is also Thomas Baugh and Thomas Snow. I think he's married at least two other women and had them killed for the insurance money. Darcy, you are being foolish! I can't believe you. Now, I think Kristina found something out. He did whatever it was that we just saw... to her! Darcy, you're sounding preposterous. He tried to save Kristina, we saw it. Dad, he made it so she couldn't sign! Oh God, that was smart, and I will give you that. Hey, you're not in a courtroom, young lady. You're at my house. Oh yeah, it's always your house when you don't wanna hear an unpleasant truth, Dad! Brea, I need you to just believe me on this, okay? Every single instinct in my body is telling me that you're in danger. Okay, just send him away, okay? And let me, let me investigate him. And if I'm wrong, I will spend the rest of my life apologizing to you. But if he loves you like he says he does... he'll agree. Do you even hear yourself? - Brea, I know it sounds... - No! Darcy... you've done enough talking. Do you wanna know what I think? I think you are jealous. No. I think you never got over Jeremy, and you just can't stand that I'm so happy. No, Brea. I guess you just concocted this whole story because it's easier to believe than the truth. No. If you're gonna make me choose between my fiancé and my sister, I guess I choose my fiancé because he would never make me choose. Brea. - I'm gonna go after her. - Please do. I cannot believe this is happening. Are you happy now? Are you proud of yourself? Look at your mother! Look at her! Look at your sister. Dad, look at me! Do I look happy to you? Dad, I know I'm a lot of things, but I'm not a liar! Douglass, take me back to the city. - Dad, you have to believe me. - Douglass, now. You've lied to me before. I knew it! I knew it was you the whole time! I knew it! What you did? This is gonna be louder than anything you can do. I knew it! Shut up! I said shut up! I hit you right in the meat. It went straight through your arm. It's gonna hurt like hell. But you're not gonna bleed out or anything. I need you awake, for now. Dad was right about one thing. I really am a damn good shot. Huh, Darce? You know, you were so close to figuring it out. So close, let's see... Let's see how you do with a couple more clues. Marta Baugh, my second wife, her maiden name was... Frankel. Kinsley Snow, my first wife. Any guess? What was her maiden name? Drumroll? Montgomery. Frankel and Montgomery. Is it ringing any bells yet? Come on, are you putting it together? Is it getting through that thick skull of yours?! Halston. Halston, there it is. There it is. There it is! Joseph Frankel. Joseph Frankel. - The judge. - The judge. Marta, she is his, excuse me, was his daughter. Robert Montgomery, the DA, but he doesn't, he doesn't have a daughter. No, but he does have a sister though. Estranged. You know, I'd like to think that he stays up late at night. You know, regretting the relationship that he never had. People can be so petty sometimes, don't you think? So you are killing the people connected to Halston. Hey! Show some respect. This isn't real pain. And I wasn't lying when I told you what happened to Halston after you, Montgomery and Frankel put him in jail. He had enemies in jail. You didn't know he wasn't gonna survive in prison? I didn't know that! I told you I didn't know that! Don't lie to me! Yes, my father was a criminal. Yeah, but he didn't belong in there. He was a good... He was a good dad. And he always took care of me. Do you know... do you know that when he died, do you know that they s... They sent a telegram? Like the Wild West. It's almost funny. Do you know? Do you know what it's like? Spend your entire life learning from a man who teaches you how to handle anything, everything. And then just to have that taken from you. Just, just gone. Gone! Just like that. Taken from me. I didn't know how to handle that. And the day he died, that's when I died. And that's when I realized that I need to make you all understand, to teach you, all of you, what it's like to live without your loved ones. So no, I'm not going around killing the people connected to my father's case. That's a little cliché. I'm going around killing the people connected to the people who put my dad in jail. Do you understand? Don't you see? You're getting it? I don't want to kill you. I just wanna make you feel what it feels like to have everything taken away from you. I want you to know what that's like. No. Hmm. Too bad your phone doesn't work. You could call for help. This is so easy. It's easy. You just flash a smile and say a couple charming things and wow, they just fall all over you. Except you. Except you, Darcy. You just kept pushing. Well, what, what about the insurance money? What, why? The insurance? The insurance. Honey, that was just a perk. Get over the insurance. Come on. I do all the heavy lifting. I deserve to retire on a boat someday. In an ideal world, you know, I was hoping to have your sister sign the paperwork before I killed her. But then you came along and you changed up the entire plan. And as my kindergarten teacher knows, I don't do well when people mess up my plans! In an ideal world, I'd be sitting with a fat check right now, and you'd be at home broken, mourning the loss of how your loved one was taken from you. The thing you loved most. That's what I wanted to be doing. No! That's what I wanted for you. That's pain! That's pain! I'm just gonna have to be happy with you knowing that right after I leave here, I'm gonna drive back to your parents' house and I'm gonna let your sister console me in whatever naughty, creative ways that she sees fit! No, no! And then as she lays in bed, sad because her sister doesn't see what she sees in me, then I'm gonna strangle her to death with my bare hands. Nice and slow. No don't! Please don't! Then I'm gonna go and I'm gonna disappear forever. I want you to know that's exactly where I'm going the second I leave here. That's what I want you to think about Darcy as you die. No, no! Brea, honey? I'm in the office! I am so sorry that I left. I didn't think you'd come back. I didn't know if I should. I'm so sorry. I don't know what got into my sister. She's not usually... Honey, your sister's not here anymore. I know, I know. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm just... I just got a lot on my mind. Yeah. I just can't get over how petty Darcy's being. What do you mean? She even took her plaque off the wall. I guess after everything she didn't think Dad deserved to have it. So petty. I think we've had enough of Darcy today. What is... I'm gonna go shower. Meet me upstairs? Mm-hmm. Be right there! I'm coming, Brea. You look stressed. Do I? I mean, it's a pretty intense weekend. Things didn't really go as I planned. Are you kidding? My parents loved you. My friends loved you. Yeah, but your sister, she thought I was a murderer. She'll figure it out. She doesn't see people the way I see people. She only sees the worst. And what do you see? Only the best. Little late on a holiday weekend. I'll get it. Hi, I have a delivery for Thomas Schure from Heidelberg Mutual. You're late. You were supposed to deliver this yesterday. A lot's happened since then. That's, uh... really fascinating. Could you sign there, please? What's your name? Derek, what's yours? - Thomas. - Oh, yeah, yeah. You can call me sir. Great, have a nice night, Tommy. Heidelberg Mutual, the insurance company? Yeah, I'm sure you've seen the commercials. And you had it overnighted? Yep. So... Brea, please let me explain. Explain what? That my sister was right about you? Actually, yeah. That's exactly it. I was a little worried that you weren't gonna get it. Your family's a little dense. It would just be easier to shoot you, but I made a promise. And believe it or not, I actually hate to lie! Why? Oh my God! I've already explained this once tonight to your sister before I killed her. This isn't about you, Brea. You were just a tool and now you're just gonna be evidence! Brea! You would've made a terrible wife. Get your hands off my sister! Darcy! Come on, come on. Oh, well, well, well. Look who came back from the dead. Go, let's walk to the living room. Go. You can put your hands down. Not you. I know it hurts to keep them up. I'm just kidding, I'm not a savage. Put 'em down. This is how I killed Kristina. Or almost. Last I heard she was in a coma. Sometimes it takes a while. You want to hear something funny? I had the antidote on me the entire time. I could have saved her! I could have saved her instantly. Oh, well, I guess only I find that funny. Oh, all right. Hmm. I would like to just shoot you both, but I figure if you die the same way that your maid does, might throw the cops off long enough for me to disappear. You know, things really do work out. Now, you get to watch your sister die. It's more of a courtesy than what you gave me with my dad. You don't have to do this. You're right, I don't have to. I get to. Brea, come on! I gotta admit, Sis, things aren't really going as planned! I know you're tired. I am. So let's just end this, all right? Okay, I know you're not leaving without your sister! And you know I'm not gonna stop until you're dead. So here's the deal. You're both gonna die tonight. But if you play nice and come out, I'll hit you with the needle first. It's painless. Mostly. But if you make this hard for me, well, I promise to carve up your sister in front of you like a Christmas ham. And then I'm gonna get real creative with you. I'm gonna give you 10 seconds to think about it. Better not be playing games with me, Darce. Best player? I'm keeping the ring! Oh my God. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Are you all right? Okay, that's a dumb question. We gotta go now. Come on. No! No, you're not. Not keeping the ring. Dad? How did you? I forgot my duck call! Go ahead, give him a reason, and you will be mulch in my garden before afternoon tea. Drop the gun. I never did like you. Drop the gun, hit the ground, now! Oh, try me. I gave the hospital the name on the label of that vial, and they said that Kristina should make a full recovery. Oh, thank God. And how are you doing, kiddo? I mean, I probably shouldn't have fought with the paramedics so much, but I'm okay. We'll take you back to the hospital tomorrow morning. I'm so sorry for everything. Oh, stop that silly talk. It's nobody's fault but Thomas'. I'm just disappointed your father didn't get a chance to aerate his chest with buckshot. Mom, when did you get so dark? When somebody tried to hurt my girls. Ah. Hey, this is the first time in a long time that it's been just the four of us. Well, maybe we need to start making that happen more often. I'd like that. So would I.

Don't tell my father you helped me, okay? Is that, is that a green bottle smoothie from David's? Yeah, I can't start my morning without one. Yeah. My, my sister calls them vegan death sludge. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. The price we pay to be healthy. Oh. Oh, right. You know, I have a secret. Oh, do you? I like to put in a little honey. It makes it less sludgy. Mm-hmm. Well, maybe we can meet at David's tomorrow morning, and I could buy you one. How does 7AM work for you? I'll be there.
