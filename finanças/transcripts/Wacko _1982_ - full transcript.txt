Death to all teenagers who fuck. This is me 13 years ago. Hi, my name is Mary. This is my big sister Pam. She's getting ready for the Halloween Pumpkin Prom. Damn it daddy, what are you doing? Nothing dear. I was just mowing the lawn. Sure daddy, that's what you always say. Well, here we are. Guy, you're such an adult. When my mother told me I'd have to be taking care of my sister and her friends, I thought I'd have to miss the Halloween Pumpkin Prom. Oh not on your life. They won't be any trouble at all. Now Mary, you're in charge. And I want you to make sure that Bambi, Rosie, and Johnny don't get into any trouble. Okay. Have a good time! Halloween has always been a special time of the year for me. You may think I'm crazy, but there really is a pumpkin headed lawnmower killer. And he really did chop up my big sister Pam with a power lawnmower. I still have nightmares. It all happened 13 years ago today. Damn it daddy, what are you doing? Nothing darling, just, mowing the lawn. Sure daddy, that's what you always say. I don't have time for breakfast. I've got a hysterectomy at nine. Has anyone seen my scalpel? Damian sweetheart, have you seen daddy's scalpel? Damian. This one? No, not that one. Where did I put that? Dad, don't forget. You and mom promised to chaperone the Halloween Pumpkin Prom tonight. Of course I'll be there. How could I forget my little girls Halloween Pumpkin Prom? Where is the scalpel? Will this do dear? What would I do without you? I don't wanna upset you, but if anything happens, I just want you to know I love you. And I love you too! So long pops! Oh your father's been under a terrible strain lately. I think it's beginning to show. Yeah. He's acting like he just killed somebody. Mary! Your father is a doctor! He kills people every day! Yeah! Murder? Yeah. Nurse? Yeah, where? Oh, yeah. Bloody? Yeah. Arm severed. Yeah, actual pieces. Yeah, yeah, I get the picture. No, no it's not a pretty one. I'll be right there, yeah. Gun. Monkey. Alright, who is she? One of our night shift people, a nurse. What was she doing out here? She worked here. The hospital. Detective, there's something you should know. One of your crazies escaped last night. How did you know that? Well it's obvious, look over here. Any damn fool can see that. Look it here! There's a rope hanging out of the window! Dust. One of the other nurses heard her say, "I think I'll take a shortcut "through the woods tonight." Typical nurse move. No human could have done this. Must be the work of a wild animal. Maybe a werewolf. Or maybe the Lawnmower Killer. Go ahead kid laugh, but you're too young to remember those ghastly, grizzly, ghoulish, god awful murder in this states history! I was four when it happened. I wouldn't sleep until the murderer was brought to justice. You mean you haven't slept in 13 years? I'm 31 years old doc, you tell me. No forget it. I wanna know about this crazy who escaped. Who was he? We don't know. Rackets were burning a fire. Is he dangerous? 13 years he's been locked in his room watching TV talk shows. The only people he knows are Moreau, and Mike, and Phil, and Dina and Johnny. Answer your question? Poor bastard. We found this in his room. It's a calendar. Good. And today's date circled. In blood. He's back. After 13 years he's back and I'm gonna nail him this time. What? No, who. I don't know, I'm asking you. What? Who? Who what? I don't understand. Forget it! All I know is today is October the 31st. 31 backwards is 13. It's Friday, it's Halloween. It's the 13th anniversary of the Lawnmower Killings. There's a crazy loose. It's prom night. I'm gonna need coffee. Hi Mary. Hi Norman. How are you this morning? I'm fine, how are you this morning? Well, I am so excited about, well, about- Making love for the first time tonight? Right. Oh I know Norman. I can't think of anyone in the world I'd rather lose my virginity to. Yeah. I know what you mean. Norman! Mary. Stop that right now! Mary, I can't help it if I sound like a lawnmower every time I get excited. Can you stop that! I'm okay, it's okay. It's okay now. Oh Norman, how are we ever going to make love? I'm the only virgin in the whole school. But every time I hear that lawnmower sound I, I, I... I think this might turn the trick. Oh Norman. Earplugs. How thoughtful. I love you Mary. I love you too Norman. Don't you think we should be getting on to school now? I'd rather get onto you Mary. Are you and Norman really gonna do it tonight? After the prom. So you're finally gonna picnic on Normans hot dog. Rosie! I'm not gonna picnic on anyone's hot dog! I'm nervous enough about tonight already. Still thinking about your sister? I don't know about you guys, but I still have nightmares. You know, I wonder whatever happened to Johnny. Just think, a little guy like that running away at four-years-old. Yeah, must have been a real nightmare for him trying to find a job and being so short. Could we change the subject? It's giving me the creeps. Did you get a date yet Bambi? No. I still have a full school day to work on it. Are you still going with Tony Schlongini or did he get kicked out of school for wearing his pants too tight? Very funny. Maybe I could ask Norma to fix you up with someone. Oh, I don't know. I don't wanna end up with some mystery date. Watch this. Oh leave him alone. He's already gone through two pairs of pants this week. Hi gorgeous. You know, you got champagne taste sweetheart. How ya doing? I'm just burning some homework. Sneak preview. Guess what? I'm not wearing any panties. And I'm not gonna be wearing any tonight either. What do ya think about that? See ya tonight. Come on girls. Oh my god. Don't be embarrassed by Rosies crass attitude. Why, I bet half the girls in this school don't wear panties. But Tony, I want you to know that not all girls are like that. I'm wearing mine, see. Oh my god. So, forget about it. My god Harbinger. Look at you, you're a mess. You haven't shaved in a week, you need a haircut. And what's with the suit, you sleeping in it? Chief I gotta talk to ya. Harbinger, every Halloween for 13 years you've come in here screaming about a lawnmower murder. Chief, this time it's different. It's the 13th anniversary. I don't give a damn if its Jack The Rippers birthday. Now look, I'm not sending three cops to some pumpkin prom looking for a psycho with a pumpkin head, a big nose, and a bunch of garden tools! If you don't believe me, maybe you'll believe this guy. Harbinger! Chief, this is Dr. Denton. The way you dot your I's, it's very anal. I love you. How do you do? Your secretary has a magnificent butt. Who is this guy? He happens to be one of the fine- I can speak for myself. I happen to be one of the finest psychoanalysts in the state mental facility. Ask me again and I'll tell you the same. Nice haircut, you repressed? Who is this clown? He called me a clown. That upsets me. Get him out of here. I feel unneeded. I can't function as an unneeded person! Chief, we need this guy. Please. Apologize. No! No, it's too late! You've inflicted emotional wounds which may take year to heal! Get him out of here! But, I understand your problem. And your haircut. So I will be a good citizen and cooperate. Just tell the chief what you told me. I love black women. No, about the patient who escaped! Well the guy was a wacko. They brought him in 13 years ago. His records were destroyed in a fire. All I know is that he saw something horrible and violent. And retreated completely into a psyche. Is he capable of murder? Well, he's catatonically introverted with undertones of psychotic schizophrenia. What does that mean? If you piss him off, run. That's it. Thank you doctor. Doctor. No, on the other hand there could be a- Doctor. Now on the other hand I might have a few other theories that might be of interest to you. You're a great help! Damn it Chief, the Lawnmower Killer is back and I'm gonna get him. Now I've got Olsen and Johnson waiting out in the hall waiting to stake out that school. All we needs a sign from you. Will you give me that sign Chief! Does that mean no? Hey Harbinger, are you gonna get the Lawnmower maniac this year? Harbinger, bust any lawnmowers lately? Shouldn't you be staking out the pumpkin patch about now? Harbinger, mow this! Excuse me! What do you want? I need to talk to you about something that happened 13 years ago. It involves Halloween, and prom night, a lawnmower, a pumpkin head, and a large nose. Buzz out of here wise guy! No wait! Doesn't this ring a bell? Laugh it off nimrod! Alright, I'm warning you guys now! I've got your home address! I know where you live! Get out of here you weirdo. No one ever listens to me. They'll be sorry. They'll see. They'll all see. Science is a discipline which involves observational procedures, patterns of argument, and methods of presentation, and of course, careful calculations that are logical. The concepts that matter is in continual motion must reveal over the concepts that matter is in a state of static equilibrium. Thus, as I am clearly demonstrating, I've got to immerse the molecular of starch of atoms in molecules may not be considered binding. Lola, if you please! Over here. Yeah. What's happening? Dr. Moreau's a great teacher. He makes science so believable. I hear he has his own island. Not here Norman! What would people think? See you at lunch Schlong? Nah, I can't eat before the football game. I get cramps. I don't know what you're so nervous about, De Palmas creamed you guys for the last 13 years. Oh yeah? Well tonight's gonna be different. We're gonna tear 'em limb from limb. You know, Dr. Moreau was telling- Dr. Moreau made us swear never to tell living soul about the secret serum he's gonna give us. The serum that's gonna turn our team of pansies into a pack of wild animals. So shut up. Sorry. It's okay. No, I apologize. It's okay. No, now I feel very bad- Tony, it's okay. We'll see you girls later. Sure, they laugh now, but they don't remember that fatal night 13 years ago. Something evil gripped this town. I need a coffee. That's when I started drinking. I was just a rookie making my nightly rounds that evening when I saw a beautiful young girl in need of assistance. Oh she couldn't of been more than 15 or 16, but she was a whole woman. I looked over at her and noticed her pouting lips aching for mine. As I drove along, we didn't say much, but apparently she liked me. She hiked up her skirt inch by inch by inch revealing her creamy statutory thighs. I reached over and gently tweaked... No, no, no, that didn't really happen. The true story is this. I was working on a vice. Did some routine undercover work at the local massage parlor. No! "Bad Sergeant" she yelled as she cracked her whip across my back. I begged her to stop but she wouldn't. Pain surged through my body. Oh god, it was... No wait a minute, no, no. That didn't really happen either. No, the true story, and you gotta take my word for it this time, was this. The family was hysterical, the Rabbi was dead. I had to whip out my switch blade and circumcise that kid myself. God no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look, look, I'll give you the real true honest to god flashback right now. Yeah. Now what happened was, I was driving home late at night. It was after the policeman's Halloween Ball. Boy was I depressed. I had to go dressed as a damn clown. Maloni had stolen my costume that year. It was about midnight when I got the call. Some gruesome murder at the local high school. It was the most grizzly thing I'd ever seen. Blood was everywhere. The bodies were unrecognizable. The weapon of death was a large gas-powered lawnmower. I was revolted. But you know what really pissed me off was Maloni standing there in my kangaroo suit. I was so upset that I volunteered for the job of breaking the news to one of the victims parents. A doctor and Mrs. Graves. Telling parents that their child is dead is about the hardest thing I can think of. I still haven't figured out an easy way to do it. That's why I thought I'd ease on into it. Trick-or-treat. Well here's a nice shiny red apple. Police business. I'd like to have a few words with ya. Oh I, I... Look, if it's about the razor blades int he apples again, it was an accident. I was shaving over the fruit and one of them dropped in. I'm sorry about the little boy and it won't happen again. Get the apple back. I'm afraid this is more important than that. Look out! Over there! I'm sorry, what were you saying? About your daughter. Pam, what about her? Well I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just have to be blunt. Pam's been murdered. And your other daughter Mary, she saw the whole thing. She's bound to be screwed up by the terrible images she must carry with her for the rest of her life. Look, I'm sorry. If it's any consolation... See. See, once again. See, it's a giraffe. Cute little devil huh? That was 13 years ago and I remember it just like it was yesterday. Let them laugh all they want. I'm gonna solve this case if it kills me. I've got a picture of every dip that's come into this lawnmower shop for the last 13 years. One of these dips is the Lawnmower Killer. A man can only take so much shit before he has to start throwing some of it back. I think I know just where to start. The perverted school gardener Deke. Have you ever seen this man before? No. Have you ever seen this woman before! Look, I'm not here to play games with you Deke! That's Zeke. So don't pretend you don't know what I'm here for! Well, let me guess. This is the classic cast suspicion on perverted school gardener scene? Oh you got it Deke! Zeke! Whatever. Let's just remember I'm onto you. You step out of line I'll be there. You make a wrong move I'll be there. You take your clothes off, I'll be there. This day is lasting forever. It seems like an eternity until tonight. - The hours seem like days. - Oh yes. The minutes seem like hours. The seconds seem like, like- A long time. Mary, tonight'll be the first time we've ever, well, we've ever had a chance to- Pork. Norman! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I just got excited for a second. You didn't tell anybody about my problem did you? No, of course not. What's the matter? Don't you trust me? Oh I'm sorry Mary, of course I trust you. And I'm really honored that you're still a virgin. Oh, Tony's in the pea soup again. It's good stuff. Well, well, well, Dick Harbinger back again this year to get all hot about Lawnmower Killer I suppose. Well I have a lot more important things to get all hot about then that. Take a look at this young man here. Take a good long look at the sinner. Are you listening sinner? Yes. A perfect example of today's depraved youth. Yes, reduced by societies wanton lust to nothing more than a pleasure seeking animal. Sure. When he's hungry he eats, when he's tired he sleeps, and when he gets aroused! I don't even like to think about it. Yes, who can turn back the tide of this rising boys hot blood? Who can quell his thriving passions? His parents couldn't clamp down. Society couldn't clamp down. But I, Harry Palms shall clamp on down. Yes we shall. What better way to stop a vice than rid a vice? Are you a sinner! Yes I am! Do you repent of your sins? Yes I do Mr. Palm. Whoa! Look at him now. Yes, gentle as a lamb and blank as a fart. How'd a gonad like you ever become vice principal? That's a good question my boy. It's a good question. Because I'm a man who understands the vice and corruption among our young men and women today. Yes I do. Why I've read about it, I've lectured about it, I've taught about it, I've watched it all over. Yes, look it! I've even confiscated these 313 pairs of delicious panties. Yes, I have whips, chains, leather garters, and even my own flock of adorable young sheep. Yes, you ask me how this gonad got to be vice principal, I'll tell ya. Experience, I know vice. Damn it Harry Palms, we gotta killer loose around here and I wanna know what the hell you're gonna do about it! Can I be frank Dick? Well sure Frank. Let me tell you frankly Dick, I'm just bored, bored, bored, bored with this lawnmower crap you've been giving me every year. I'm sick of it to death. Yes you're not a believer. I can see it in your eyes. I know it all. It's a wives tale this lawnmower thing. Why I know this school like I know the back of my hand. You don't have faith, you just trust in me. I could help you. I could help you become a believer. I could lay hands on your head. I'd love that. Am I getting through to you? What? Another lawnmower nightmare Ms. Graves? Don't you think it's about time you got over this silly lawnmower phobia of yours? I realize you're bound to be screwed up by the terrible images you'll carry around with you the rest of your life, but if one can't sleep in the library without being disturbed, where can one sleep? I think you owe the entire library an apology. I'm sorry. Norman. Hey, tell me what's my combination? Yeah, it's 13, 13, 13. Can you repeat that? 13, 13, 13. Okay, thanks a lot man. Guess who? Alright alright, who, guess who. Go ahead. No, guess who. Who what? What? Who? Where? I don't know where, I don't know who, the lawnmower killer alright. Where! Where! Boy Tony, you really pulled a boner on that one. How can you be such a geek? That's Zeke! Oh whatever. How can you forget that it was Mary's sister Pam who got chopped up into hamburger meat by that fiend right before her eyes and she's bound to be screwed up by the images she must carry around with her the rest of her life? I really apologize. That's okay. I don't mean it. I'm sick. Forget it Tony. I really feel sick that you're sick about this so I'm- Tony! It's alright! I'm sorry. Oh my god. What, what, what! My god! Stand back! Out of bullets. What is it? A baby lawnmower. Who would do such a thing! Oh darling. You'd be surprised the depths of depravity some people would seem to... Don't even mess with me hood. Hey come back! Come back, stop! Wait! Halt! Most accidents are caused by nothing more than carelessness! And a lack of respect for common courtesy! Hey man, what are you doing? Go on man. Hey man, stop! What're you doing man? Move out of the way! Where the hell are ya going! Touchdown! Pretty handy with the car big guy. I admire a man who knows how to put 424 cubic inches of hot pounding pistols in its place. Oh, so do I little girl. Oh Tony! Get back down! I guess a big guy like you already has a date for the Halloween Pumpkin Prom huh? Yes sweet cheeks, I got a date alright. With destiny. Tony it's never been that good. Ever. Yeah, I'll give it a seven. Alright sweetheart? Damian, how many times I have told you this is not a toy! Who is it? Just a moment. Darling, I'm very busy. I'm stitching up Mr. Cooper. He just had a hysterectomy. Dr. Graves, Dr. Graves, Mrs. Cooper is ready for her hysterectomy in operating room 13. We're waiting for you. I'm sorry darling, go ahead. It was thrown right through the front window with a note attached. It says, "It's Halloween, it's prom night. "There's a psycho loose, so don't open the door, "don't answer the phone, don't look in the attic, "don't go to the bathroom, don't go into the ocean, "and don't go into space 'cause no one "can hear you scream. "Signed a friend." Marge! You can't go into a tizzy every time some nut throws a lawnmower through the window! Take two aspirin, call me in the morning. I don't know why we bother to suit up anymore. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. We haven't won a game in the 13 years I've been a senior you know. What is that coming out of your locker? What the hell? Now stand back. Don't touch it! - Just stand back. - What is it! - Relax, stand back. - Don't touch it! What is it? - Just stand back. - Don't touch it! What is it! Stand back, it's my locker! Relax. What is it? It's just a pair of my old gym socks. I must of left them in there too long. It's just like you Tony. I'm telling you Chief, he's back. I saw him and I chased him. Now we gotta get some down here right away. Harbinger, I don't want anymore of your- Look Chief. I pulled this lawnmower out of a girls locker today. I'll be off in a minute buddy. Chief, now I've got suspects all over the place here. The Geek. That's Zeke! The Looney. A weirdo. A jock. I even began to worry about my own son, little Dick. Chief, this is a matter of life and death. I don't know what's the matter with you guys down there. Harbinger, this is the work of a werewolf. That's right. Now we're gonna find the werewolf and get a conviction from him. Fact is, tactical squad is out looking for him in the woods. What's wrong Mary? I'm just allergic to these damn pom poms. I know that's not it. I'm scared about tonight. About making it with Norman or getting hacked up by the lawnmower killer? Or both? No, I'm gonna miss cheerleading. It's our last game. We're seniors guys. We're young, pretty, popular, white Anglo-saxon protestants. Cheerleading is all we know. But after tonight our creamy white thighs, sparkling smiles, and pouting breasts won't mean shit. Let's not let our bleak future put a damper on our spirit. We're gonna go out there tonight and come back a star. Let's go. Ready? Ready. I promised you that when I took over this team last year that our record of zero wins, 113 losses had to stop. Tonight my pets, I mean men, I'm going to keep that promise. You have received the benefit of 25 years of scientific experimentation. Football is a game that requires courage, guts. Nein, nein. Determination. But most important of all, confidence. Savage, animal confidence. To do a thing, you must first now what that thing is. Once you know what that thing is, you must believe with all your heart and soul that it can be done! Once you believe that it can be done, next, you must get up and do it! And that it is this game! We are going to win this game. Why? Because we have confidence. We have the desire! We have the determination! And most important of all, we have me, Dr. Mangler! I mean Dr. Moreau. Now, let's get out on that field and show them what we are made of. Are we tough? Are we mean? Are we animals! Let's get out on the field and tear them limb from limb! Men, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! I am not a mascot, I am a human being! Thanks for the lift! Hi mom. Hi dear. Anything happen at school today? No. I mean like, nothing. Same old boring routine. How was the game? It was like totally totally weird! I mean like, I just couldn't believe it. I mean you know, like, we won for the first time in 13 years. Our boys ate them up. That's nice. Oh, there was a phone message for you. From Norman? Oh wow, he didn't say. Oh come on mom. What did he say? Well, at first it goes like... Well, at first he goes, "Your daughters gonna die tonight!" Then he says,. Far out. Friend of yours dear? Probably. It must be that devil in the attic again. I'll go all by myself and check it out. Oh, good idea darling. Come on Mary. Damn it Damian. How many times have I told you to stay out of the attic? Telegram. "Darling, have a wonderful time "at the Halloween Pumpkin Prom. "See you soon. "Yours truly, El Diablo." Oh shit. What am I doing! Hi big guy, you wanna go to the Halloween Pumpkin Prom with me? This is a defeated man. A man at the end of his rope. End of the line and he's played out his string to the bitter end. How else can I put it? You're on your last leg! He's on his last lap. I said leg! Oh whatever. He can't take much more of this. He's on the fringe, the verge, the brink. He's hearing voices in the night. All I know is if he doesn't get some sleep pretty soon, it's gonna be farewell my lovely Dick. Damn it daddy, what are you doing? Nothing dear, mowing the lawn. Sure daddy. That's what you always say! I think UCLA is a wonderful college for Rosie. That way she won't have to leave home. Nonsense Leonor, she'll be attending Harvard just like her father. And what are your plans, Anthony? What? You talking to me? Yes Anthony. Anthony. Don't ever- Tony. Stay out of this Rosie. Don't ever, ever call me Anthony. Call me Tony. Call me Mr. Schlongini. My friends like to call me the Schlong, ya know? But never call me Anthony. Do we understand each other? Yes, Mr. Schlongini. Gini. Gini, yes. Dinner's delicious. Yes. Why thank you. And what have you two planned after the prom tonight? Rosie. Not again. Norman, I'm just delighted that you and your mother could join us for dinner. Well, it was very kind of you to invite us Mrs. Graves. I don't get out of the house much Mrs. Graves so this is a real treat for me. Well it's a real treat for us too Mrs. Bates. I bet you didn't know that my mom can sing and drink water at the same time! No. I'd like to see that Norman. I'm not really thirsty Norman. Oh yes you are mother. No, no I'm not really thirsty. Yes, yes! Here we go, ready? One, two... What's with this yavo? Mrs. Bates is singing! I think it's time to carve the bird dear. Yes, yes. What! The Lawnmower killer! Where! Now look at what you made me do. Sorry mom. Mary, this lawnmower phobia of yours has gotten completely out of hand. I know you're bound to be screwed up by that terrible images that you've gotta carry with you for the rest of your life, but why does it have to extend to the rest of us? You look tired son. Have you been getting enough sleep? Now realize that you're old enough now to make your own decisions son. But you can't take the job home with you. You have to learn to let go. Otherwise you'll find yourself in an early grave. Dick, you know I think the problem is is that you're not getting enough exercise. Why a key to a goodnight sleep is physical exhaustion. Dick, take it from me older brother, all you need is a good woman. No, no, what he needs is simply to- You don't think it's too modern? Really mom? Dad did a good job. It's one of the best haircuts you've ever had. Well how sweet. Come on darling. I want to take a good picture of you in your little Alice in Wonderland costume. Mom, do we have to do this? Oh you both look so gorgeous. Now come on, smile. Alright, now one more, one more. Mom, we'll be late. There's been an emergency at the hospital. I'll see you later. You go on to the Halloween Pumpkin Prom without me. Alright dear. Bye bye. Goodnight Dr. Graves. I guess we should be on our way. Okay. Damian darling. Damian, Mrs. Bates has been kind enough to sit with you tonight. So I want you to be a very very good boy. Mamas precious angel. Okay ma. Oh you know, just being here with you kids tonight sure brings back a lot of fond memories. I remember my first pork. What Mrs. Graves? The prom Norman. My first Halloween Pumpkin Prom. I'll never forget the first time I saw your father. He was so handsome in his pink sport coat and his white carnation. Standing there, outside my bedroom window. If I'm rambling on too much, just let me know. Oh not at all. Hey Dick. What! One last dance, kids. It's just a costume. That's your story. Police business. Come on Tony, dance with me. Hey, what do you wanna start, a riot in here? People will go berserk. Have you seen Bambi? Sure, I guess Bambi didn't get a date. Golly, I hope she's not sitting at home all alone. Ah, don't worry about her. She's probably just sitting at home all alone. Hey, ain't that Bambi? Who's that bald headed guy behind her? I don't know. Maybe the Lawnmower Killer. Wait, come back! Thanks a lot Mary! I know he's a little tall but you didn't have to scream! I'm sorry, I thought he was, I thought he was- He was my date. Now I'm gonna have to go find him! Looney! You sure scream a lot. I'm sorry. I'm bound to be screwed up by the terrible images I must carry with me The rest of my life. Oh yes, this is definitely me. This is me, this is me. I've come on home. Whoo, yes! Oh party hardy to the sounds of the mighty, mighty. That's me. Tonight is the night I'm gonna party boy. I'm on my way downtown. Yes mama, fix me up with a cab. Oh my gosh, literate. Yes, just like in the Lincoln Continental. I forget my head. Ooh, this in black glitter. Ooh, it's too much! Yes, if the silvers could only see me now, I swear boogie fever was a nose infection. Yes, I'm coming back and get this on. Love it! What? What is that noise? I think the village people have come to audition me. Anything! I believe in trick-or-treat. Money. Oh money. Yes, you come over I have a Mars bar. Well maybe I have some marshmallows. How about a little treat here? Ooh yes, you've come to be healed of sin. You've come to the right place my friend. Why I can just squeeze your head too but I'd get pumpkin pie. Ooh, put a little pressure on me now. Man I'm corny, I'll take care of the thing you need! Yeah! Oh darling, it's you! Where have you been? I just got out of OR. What happened to you? It looks like you got thrown out of a car. I was just telling the kids about the first night we met. Oh you did get thrown out of a car. Looney! Looney! Where for art thou Looney? Is that you? Why'd you run away? Look, I'm sorry if my friend scared you. That's just Mary, she's a screamer. Don't you wanna go to a Halloween Pumpkin Prom with me? I can't allow you to leave if you're going out for drugs or drink. That's against the rules. It's okay. We're just having some kinky sex. Oh, alright then. Superman. What? Cafeteria. Yeah food, alright. Let's go. Ketchup. This is crazy Rosie. Real crazy. I want cherries. You got it. Two of 'em. You got it, you got it. Just give me a second. One, two. I suppose you want nuts too? That's right. Yours. Oh yeah? Well I'm more powerful than a locomotive. I hope you're not faster than a speeding bullet. What are you doing in here? I got dibs on this sundae. Hey, what you're getting your kicks from spying on people or something? Tony. This guys some kind of sicko. Some psychologist. Alright pumpkin head, let's go right now. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I got a deal for you. I got a deal. I'll give you this gold chain, okay, if you let us go. I'm desperate. Not on a school day. Rosie. What do you think you're doing? Run hot water if you're gonna use the disposal! Thanks a lot mom! No respect for school property. You gotta be kidding me. They'll be sorry. All of them will be sorry. You wait and see you. Sorry. Mary. Yes Norman. Have I ever told you how much I, how much I- Love me? Yeah. And no matter what happens tonight Mary, no matter what happens I'll still, I'll still- Respect me. Yeah right. And holding you in my arms right now, I am just so, so- Horny you can taste it. Exactly. Well you just stay that way. I'll be right back. Mary, where are you going? I'm going to look for Bambi. I'm worried about her. Well I'll go with you. No, this is something I just have to do alone. Why? Don't ask me why. Well how come? Norman. Look Mary, I'm not letting you go out there alone. It could be dangerous out there. You think I'm afraid just because its Halloween and prom night, there's a psycho on the loose, it's pitch black outside and I'm carrying around a childhood images that are bound to screw me up for the rest of my life. I'm not afraid. Darling, you know we've been married 30 years and there's one thing I've always wanted to ask you. What is that? What is your first name? Doctor. No, no, I mean really. I'm not kidding, Doctor is my first name. I don't have a degree in anything. My fathers name was nurse. Bambi! Bambi! Bambi. It's dark out here, don't play games. I'm sorry I scared your date. Bambi is that you? Is anybody there? I'm not gonna scream and I'm not gonna run. I'm not gonna scream and I'm not gonna run. Help me! Somebody please! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt anybody. I take that back. Ooh shit. Help! Help me! Mr. Palms, let me in! Mr. Palms. Oh, Mr. Palms. Don't just stand there, help me. There's a Halloween Pumpkin Prom Lawnmower Killer on the loose. What's that on your head? I'm in deep shit ow. Hold it, I'll be right with you. Okay, I'm ready now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I never meant to kill anyone. What? You asshole! Can't you stay dead? Marge honey. I think we need a drink. Me too. Thank god! Daddy. Hey baby! Oh help me daddy! Oh my baby, so pretty. How did that happen? Let me see if I can't put that back. You've been a big help dad. Thanks. Oh hi mom. Hi there! Don't do anything I wouldn't do. I really don't know what to say about this. I'm really choked up. But well, thanks for electing me queen in the Halloween Pumpkin Prom. And thanks for giving me this wonderful door prize. In honor of this occasion, I'd like to recite a little poem that I wrote for Mar just for this. It goes something like this. "She's lived in fear since I've known her. "The mighty roar of the old lawnmower." Help me somebody! Norman. Norman! Mary, not now. Can't you see I'm right in the middle of my- You're starting to piss me off. Hold him down! Hold him down, don't trust him. Is he dead? Get back, get back! Give him room to breathe! Nice costume. Well thanks. Just something I threw together at the last minute. It's a chance of a lifetime! Good evening ladies and gentlemen. You know, they locked me up for 13 years because I cracked after witnessing the lawnmower killings and my first day out was so bad. How bad was it? Thanks doc. Well, it was so bad I saw a nurse get mauled by a werewolf, the lawnmower killer returned, and my first date in 13 years goes and gets her head chopped off. Anyway, we have a great show for you tonight. Although this monologue isn't part of it. It's Johnny! So Johnny, how've you been? Oh Mary. I've been so bad. An elephant at the Halloween Pumpkin Prom. What a cute costume. It's no costume bitch. Hi I'm Mary, who are you? Bob the elephant. Not you, him. I'm the lawnmower killer. Come on! I am the Lawnmower Killer, I'm not kidding. Oh, you couldn't possibly be. Yes, yes, yes, he really is the Lawnmower Killer. No shit. I've come back after 13 years to tell everybody that I'm all better now and it'll never happen again. Oh so silly. I just want you all to know I'm very sorry. Shit! You. A cop. But why? You naughty. Why didn't you tell me you were back? I tried to tell you. I told him he was back. They wouldn't believe me. They thought I was crazy. I wasn't crazy. I only killed those people tonight just to prove a point. That the Lawnmower Killer could return again. Anywhere, anytime. Anywhere two men judge each other by the color of their skin, anywhere that people are not free to worship the religion of their choice, anywhere that man is forbidden to buy a lawnmower, protects his home and his family. After 13 years, big sleep. Goodnight sweet prince. Flights of angels sing tonight. Well, at least we won't have to worry about the Lawnmower killer ever again. Oh Mary, oh Mary. No my darling, you won't need these earplugs anymore. Norman. Norman. Norman is that you? Mary, what is it? What's wrong? Oh nothing. Oh, just another Lawnmower Killer nightmare huh? I'm so sorry Norman. We still are unable to pork. And we've been married now 13 months, 13 weeks, 13 days, and 1.3 hours. But who's counting. Oh it's alright. With the terrible images you must carry around with you, you're bound to be screwed up the rest of your life. - Oh Norman. - Oh Mary. Damn it daddy! What are you doing? Just mowing the lawn dear. Sure daddy. That's what you always say. Mr. George Kennedy. Ladies and gentlemen, we've made fun of a lot of things during our show. Some of which, under other circumstances would not be funny at all. One very serious point. Lawnmowers do not kill people. People kill people. Well they do. Sure daddy. That's what you always say. Stand back! Don't mess with me hood. Nard. Nitwit. Gonard. Cone head. Oh yes. Dip. Nimrod. Tell him to take it back. Otherwise I'll hold it in and be scarred for the rest of my life! Harbinger what the hell is going on here? Bye bye.
