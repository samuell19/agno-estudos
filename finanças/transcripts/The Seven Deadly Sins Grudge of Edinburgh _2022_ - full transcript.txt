THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS GRUDGE OF EDINBURGH PART 1 NORTHERN BRITANNIA - LIONES KINGDOM - How's that? - Too easy. Be careful, you two. You know what? You're pretty good at this, aren't you? You're not so bad yourself. Of course. That's what happens when you've got a dad like Meliodas of the Seven Deadly Sins. Well, in that case, I don't think I have to remind you who my father is, do I? This is so fun. It feels like... ...my heart won't stop pounding. What's happening? My head... My blood feels like it's on fire. Hey. Prince Tristan! Prince Tristan! He wasn't out in the courtyard. Are you sure? Because he isn't in his room either. Prince Tristan! We searched inside and outside the castle, but we couldn't find him. What shall we do about this, King Meliodas? Gone again, huh? Wonder where he could be now. Whoa! Whoa! Impressive. Your horsemanship's already quite respectable. I wouldn't have come this far without all of your help, Gowther. From the looks of it, I have nothing left to teach you. No way. Feels like I'm just getting started. There's so much I wanna learn. You aren't gonna leave the castle anytime soon, are you? I'll still be around for a little while longer. But more importantly, should you be out riding horses with me right now? Captain... Uh, I mean, your father is expecting you, isn't he? Yeah, but it's okay. You sure about that? Uh... uh... Is there something on your mind? No, it's nothing. I'm all right. It's just... - What was that? - Let's find out. You're all right, you're all right. Hey! What happened? It's Prince Tristan! One of the carriage wheels came loose. These two were thrown off. Just hang in there. Tell me where it hurts. Hmm. It seems this man severed his extensor carpi radialis longus muscle. The other broke his right costal and ensiform cartilage. We need to get them both to Hendrickson's medical center... Understood! Hey. Are you all right? I'm fine. He's okay. I see. It seems he's inherited his mother's powers. Enjoy. We'll be okay. Thank you. Now... Why eat together when we're so far apart? I agree. This is much better. So why'd you skip practice today? There was a big accident in town, and I was helping the people who were hurt. Be honest. You were out riding with Gowther, weren't you? But I really did help those people. And yesterday? Um... Well, that's when Hendy was teaching me how to make medicine. I can heal wounds, but I can't cure diseases like Mother. So I wanted to try and learn how to treat them. That's when... Since when did you become a pharmacist, Tristan? Your dream was to become a Holy Knight one day and fight against the evil in this world. Y... yeah, but that was back when I was only a kid. Pretty sure you still are one. You're never gonna understand how I feel, Father! Hmm? Excuse me. Someone, help! Are you okay? Tristan, that power, what is it? You're hurt. What'd I do? What happened? It was Prince Tristan, my king. I'm gonna be all right. I don't understand. I didn't mean to do it. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! There you are. Mother. What's bothering you? I don't need to be a Holy Knight who fights bad guys, right? Can't I be one who tries to help people out who are suffering instead? That's a wonderful idea. And it's so very like you. Yeah. I mean, the Holy Knights are about a whole lot more than just fighting. But Tristan, what if there comes a time when that's the only way you're able to help somebody? What would you do then? It's not always easy, and your father knows that better than anyone. If it's bothering you, why don't you just sit with him and talk about it? Good night, Mother. Trist... ALPA FOREST Watch out! Who are they? Stop! Gandf! What... what will we do? Ugh! I can't believe the nerve of those savage brutes! They put Daddy in a cage. Wait, hold on. No! If you start crying, they're gonna find us! Huh? Looks like they found us. I think it's time to go. I'm stuck! Who's there? Thank you for rescuing us, kind stranger. So the rumors were actually true. Huh? Who are you? And what do you mean by rumors? I heard that there's a strange group that's been going into Giant and Fairy villages, attacking each one and taking the villagers. They're gonna take Daddy and the others away? Probably so. Uh, we have to go and rescue them! Are you crazy? We're outnumbered. If we left, we'd just be captured. Yeah, but at this rate, Recela's gonna be... Daddy. Guess they found us. It's time for us to get out of here. We'll worry about the others later. Wait up! EDINBURGH CASTLE Please let us go! Let us out! You gotta get me out of here! Why are you holding us captive like this? You need to calm down. I'll free you from this place soon enough. You're never gonna get away with this! You understand me, human? But why are there all these demons in here too? Staff of Chaos, please reveal your true power to me. Lowly races who dare defile mankind, on this fateful night every one of you shall be reborn and become my loyal servants! Magnificent. Priest, the time has come. Take action once things have been readied. Of course. Empty! Continue to seize non-humans from across the land and bring them to me. I'm finally able to exact my revenge. And soon, I will begin with them. Prince Tristan! Prince Tristan! It's an emergency! So, please wake up! Five more minutes. Queen Elizabeth is in trouble! Wait! What about my mother? She collapsed a moment ago. Prince Tristan! - Mother! - Oh, please. Hold on! Prince Tristan! How did she end up like this? What happened to her? Earlier this morning she started feeling some pain, and then she just passed out. But she seemed perfectly fine last night. Hendy, do you think she could be sick? No. I've given her all kinds of medicine, but none of them are working. I think somebody may have put a curse on her. An extremely powerful one. But who would want to do that, and why? You can't use your druid magic to cure her? I tried, but it didn't work. Lady Elizabeth could probably break the curse easily using her own magic, but in her condition... Let me try. Tristan. I'm gonna rescue you, Mother. Where am I? Huh. He's right. Somebody did this to her. Who's there? I want answers. It's your turn. Now you'll pay. What is it, Priest? It would appear that someone has detected me. What? Could it be Meliodas? No. This was different. The magic felt much weaker than his. It's nothing to worry about, then. All right? That must have been some random wizard. So you can continue casting the spell. Yes, sir. We have to be persistent. I want them suffering in anguish even more. Are you okay? I can't break the curse. I'm not powerful enough. Listen, you should get some rest now. No! So what's all the commotion about? Tristan! Aren't you energetic. - Gowther! - Hmm? I can sense it. I know what direction that curse is coming from. Oh. Prince Tristan! I will save Mother, no matter what it takes! Though I can't pinpoint his exact location, Tristan seems to be heading east. East, huh? Why would he be going there? Elizabeth! Meliodas. Stop Tristan before... Stay with me! Long ago I read something in an ancient book. To break a powerful curse like this, there are two methods. The first is with the healing power of the Goddess race. And the second is an age-old remedy used by the Fairy race. Fairy race? Sparkle! THE FAIRY KING'S FOREST Did you hear what happened? Alpa Forest was attacked too! Yeah, I did. That's so scary. I wonder if we're gonna be next. Now there's no need to worry 'cause we have the Fairy King and we have the Giant here, so... Your Highness! Queen Diane! Hey, you guys. You haven't seen my kids around here, have you? I just saw them right over there, by the stream. Really? Do you want us to help you look? Thank you! I swear. They keep on skipping breakfast. What is with them? Time for me to... Elizabeth! What happened? BENOIC KINGDOM Are you all right, Ban? Yeah. I was just thinking about him. Wondering where he is now and what he must be up to. Hey, don't worry. Lancelot is your son, after all. Oh, when you're right, you're right. Is there something wrong? The hell? Just as I thought. It's east. That's where they're all headed. So how are we supposed to save everyone? Well, I've got a plan. Oh! I wanna know what it is. Go on, you can tell Kulumil. Please? You're being too loud. So, keep it down or they're gonna hear you. Be quiet, you two! It's this way. I'm sure of it. But now I wonder what could be up ahead. Help! Wh... what's going on? What are those children running from? Wait, stop! That's enough! We'll do what you say. Don't attack us, we surrender! Huh? Are you kidding me? What do you think you're doing? Are we... are we gonna get captured? I already told you guys I had a plan. So just follow my lead and... Don't move! Stay away from them! Huh? It's him. That was close! Those guys almost saw me land flat on my face. You've been chasing after these poor, innocent children, and I won't stand for it. Idiot! Bad idea! I will be the one to face you! Tristan, a Holy Knight! Huh? Hey, you can't just fire on somebody when they're in the middle of a speech! Where are your manners? Seriously? Now, fight me fair and square! Stop that! It'll attack again! Put your weapon away! I'm a Holy Knight, and we never surrender! Full Cou... Hey, that's too high! Too low! Hey! Can't you aim a little closer to the middle? You... you have any idea what he's doing out there? No. All right. Full Counter! He reflected the attack. Wow! So that's Full Counter, huh? Yes, I did it. Don't worry. You're safe now! I just taught this monster a lesson. It's never gonna do something like that again. Look out! Behind you! Huh? If you wanna make sure they're dead, you've gotta finish the job, dummy! Uh, wh... wh... what did you do? Come on! You didn't need to kill that thing! Whoa. Nothing's in there. It's totally empty on the inside, which means it must've been controlled by some kind of magic. Did you really think it was gonna listen to you about manners? Look, I really don't appreciate that. I was only trying to help you guys out. - We didn't need your help. - Huh? I was gonna get them caught on purpose so we could cross into enemy territory and take down whoever's behind all this. You would've put us in danger like that? Just for a little while. A little while? Hmm? Oh, sorry. People who we all really care about were just taken away by the same group of monsters. But why would they wanna do that? Where are they? And what are these things, anyway? Uh, um... If we knew that, then we wouldn't be in this mess. There's a lot about this we don't understand, but he told us the same thing's happened to a whole bunch of Giants and Fairies lately. Yup, that's right. I have managed to figure out which way they're headed, though. Really? Yeah. They're moving east of us. East, huh? If it's okay, would you mind if I were to come along with you guys? Wow. The great Prince of Liones wants to join us for a little adventure. Well, forget it 'cause this isn't some kind of game. It's not a game to me, either. I also have a reason for going out there, and it's important to me! Oh, really? Be quiet, you big oaf! Um, hello there. My name is Kulumil, the fairy. Pleasure to meet you. Uh, um, my name's Tristan. Fate must have brought us here together. It's like a blessing from the gods themselves, wouldn't you say? Guess so. My name's Minika! And I'm Tyrone. I can tell we're all gonna get along. - You look really strong. - Whatever. By the way, what's his name? Come to think of it, I don't think he ever told us. Huh? So you all just met each other? Mm-hmm. I've never seen him around the forest until today. He showed up when we were being attacked by that monster and saved us. Mm-hmm. Anyway, I wanna know a little more about you, Prince Tristan! Y... you do, huh? So are you really the prince of Liones? Yeah. Do... A prince on a white stallion! That's so cute. We're different races, but still, I just know the two of us would make such a happy couple. Yes. Like the fairy-world legends. King Ban the human and Lady Elaine the beautiful fairy. I think I'm starting to blush. Hey, so who are you really? With those bow skills, you don't seem like most fairies. What does it matter to you who I am? That scar. Hmm? Nothing! Sorry. Well, in any case, I sure wish we knew exactly where those things are headed. - You haven't figured that out yet? - Huh? Further east of this place, there aren't any Human, Giant, or Fairy settlements. Only one thing's left. Edinburgh. A kingdom that was destroyed by vampires over 20 years ago. The Vampires of Edinburgh? I've heard of them. They were all destroyed. Father and the Seven Deadly Sins took them down. - Yeah, that's right. - Hmm? And then, six or seven years later, the whole thing was rebuilt when the remaining survivors and their allies took back the fallen realm. I had no idea about that. Liones doesn't have any contact with them. It makes sense. Edinburgh collapsed again soon after. Huh? One of the survivors who was in charge of re-establishing their domain eventually became its new king. But he wouldn't work with any races other than Humans, persecuting Fairies, Giants, and any others who lived in the surrounding area. Eventually, the people who once fought so closely beside him ran out of patience and left Edinburgh forever. Even though he became a king without any subjects to rule, he still clung on to the throne. Hm. I see. He sounds sad. Wonder what could've led up to this. He was a Holy Knight. It has to be done. I need to prove that even humans have the ability to slay an ancient demon. Lord Denzel, are you really going through with this? Don't worry. I'm ready to pay the price. For our kingdom's very future, I willingly offer these old bones to thee. Manifest! Oh, please! I'm begging for you to help us. To fight the Demon race, the one whose body you inhabit gave up his life. I refuse. But why? The monster who took Lord Denzel's life. The evil being who brainwashed us, controlling our every move. How could I ever serve in a kingdom where the king and queen who rule it are a Demon and a Goddess? I will make a country of my own. One made only for humans. Lord Deathpierce. What is it? After searching for those who dared to destroy an Empty, I found them. Really? They're just a group of children. That's remarkable! He's truly the spitting image of them. Till now, I had only heard the rumors. He's jumping into the fire to try and rescue his suffering mother! To see Meliodas in agony, I cursed the one person in this world I knew he couldn't live without, but this way, I'll be able to cause him even more torment. Knight, Mage, begin. Hey, that's it. Edinburgh Castle. It has to be. I can feel the one who put that curse on my mother. - Hey, down there. - Huh? Huh? It's Daddy! Now, we made it out here, but it's time for the hard part. 'Course if it weren't for some idiotic prince, the four of us would be inside that cage and heading straight for the castle. We can't risk going through the front 'cause we don't know how many of those things are inside that place. But the back might be... Hang on. Are you listen... Hey! What are you doing? I have to try and save everyone! Twinkling stars, carry out justice! Falling Star! Good. You are so amazing! Kulumil feels more inspired than ever! Uh... What was all that about, you big dummy? Here's an idea. Maybe you should try thinking ahead before doing something stupid! You're gonna blow it for the rest of us. So stop trying to take them on yourself, got it? Hey, you guys? - I hate to interrupt, but look! - Huh? Hurry and reflect them back with your Bull Counter! No, it's full, not bull. Full Counter! See that? I got two in a row! Maybe you oughta try reflecting them all! Hey, I'm going the best I can! Getting the timing down isn't easy! Well, it looks like they're not gonna let you use your Bull Counter anymore. It's Full Counter! And I'm ready! Twinkle Star! The magic controlling them has disappeared. Or was it purged? Hey, you know what? You're not bad. Hmm? Yeah. Feels good. That sensation's gone. I can handle those things, now. Moron! Pay attention! Huh? Prince Tristan! What is this? Daddy! - Recela! - Minika! You're all right! Are you the ones who set us free? No, it wasn't us. These two are the ones who saved you. Well, uh, just at the right place in the right time, I guess. I must thank you, brave travelers. Oh, I don't think we've met before. You must be from another forest, aren't you? You guys need to gather up your children and leave here just as soon as you can. But there have to be more prisoners here like us. Ones who are still trapped in that castle. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. I'm coming with you. I thought you were here for something else. I mean, yeah, I am. But as a Holy Knight, I can't just ignore other people in need. Is that so? We'll help too. Any way we can. Right. This is gonna be harder than anything we've faced so far. Do you really wanna stay out here and put your children in danger? Daddy. Very well, then. Thank you. You take good care of your dad. Huh. Now, go! This way! Prince Tristan! All right. Let's do this. So you're a little weird, aren't you? Yeah? How? Hmm. I'm not sure what it is, but you don't act like the other fairies. Almost seems like you're human, to me. You think so, huh? Well, you're right, 'cause I am a little different. What's this magic I'm sensing from them? It's not just the Fairy or Giant kind. There's something dark mixed in. What's that? It's you! Hey! You won't be going any further. Get out of my way! Damn! Come back here! What's going on? What was in there? It was the one who put a powerful curse on my mother. I saw him. Your mom's been cursed? Well, for right now, we've gotta take those two out first! Calm down! There's no way you can do any damage with tiny swords like those. No, 'cause this one's mine! Tristan! Star Breaker! Well, look at you go... I think you should be worrying about your own well-being right now. How unfortunate. Instead of an opponent who's truly worthy, I have to face a weak-looking fairy like you. Maybe this won't be a total loss. The least you can do is die in a way that's somewhat entertaining. Well, you're much faster than I thought you were, and it's starting to get on my nerves. I'm afraid you've reached the end. You'll no longer be able to see me. Unfortunately, that includes my attacks as well. What will you do? You can't run from me. I know exactly where you are. And I'll never tell you when it's coming. You'll simply die before putting up any resistance, submitting to the full power of my wrath. Terrifying, isn't it? Of course I won't kill you all at once. I want you to suffer first. What? How is he dodging my attacks like that? So irritating! Oh. You think you'll hit me by aiming blindly? Go ahead and try! How? That's impossible! You shouldn't be able to see me at all. If you really want to know, then I'll tell you. I'm that strong. It's pretty simple. What? They were also captured, which means that thing was too. Hey, Tristan! If you destroy... What is that idiot doing now? My blood feels hot. My pulse is racing. My head's starting to feel numb too. This sensation. If I keep on fighting, it's just gonna happen again. No. I won't be myself, and I'll lose control. I know it. And I'll probably end up hurting him! Tristan, move! Hmm? You! I guess it's also too big for these arrows to work. Get back! This thing's too powerful! You don't think I have what it takes, huh? Yeah. Well, I'm full of surprises. Huh? Are you...? It can't be. Lancelot?
