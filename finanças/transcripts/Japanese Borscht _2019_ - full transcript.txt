Hi. I'm Bob Van Lindt, actor. I've worked in the past with Eric Rivas on some other projects, and he always gave me the freedom to adlib wherever I felt it was needed in a given scene. And in the long run, that lent an authenticity to the events happening within the latest project. The film you're about to see is like no other. It was not made in Hollywood, but it was made with a community of actors chosen by the director so that you can identify and recognize them in any home turf. This is an action-packed film that has more twists and turns than a rattlesnake. No color grading here, no aspect ratios, no guessing what kind of camera we used, or you'll miss the true art in this feature. So, sit back and relax and hear the story of David, what he had to go through for love. Three thousand dead. Was it the government, was it the Middle East? Who the fuck cares? Country deserves it. I don't give a fuck who in this room has a problem with me saying that. That's the problem, we can't talk anymore. So, I said, "Fuck the 3,000." I got so many more dead in my heart. Who's to say who lives, who dies? You know, actually, woke up that morning, and I clapped. I don't give a fuck who died. Fuck the mafia, the Puerto Ricans, the Greeks, the Italians, whoever the fuck. Fuck the Japanese. Fuck 'em all. You're making money in the land of demons. Time to die. Every year, I board a plane with my brothers. We come to this great city, which is filled with so much diversity and beauty. Not a year passes that I don't come. It is with sadness I know that 24 Japanese nationals died on that day. Twenty-four is a family. It can be your family. Act with kindness. So, it's with deep respect that I ask you to think before you speak with arrogance. I gotta have good reason to guide you. My son was about your age. 9/11, I lost my son in Tower 1. Old men with wise words. Look, Grandpa, I took martial arts for 19 years. I also kickbox and I got boxing golden gloves. So... I don't feel like going all the way Bruce on you... but I will. I feel like kicking ass. Seriously, did you order the Japanese borscht? Get out of here. Get your hands off me, man. Time to go. My life is like a movie. Wide-screen flat, student film, Hollywood. But it's always my life. Congratulations, man. You just killed a priest, an innocent man. There's no fucking innocent priest so shut the fuck up. What's one less priest in the fucking world anyway. There's one guy we're supposed to kill, it's that fucking David guy in the car. You see him? In that car! Not a fucking priest. Fuck you then. You want him dead? I'll do it right here on the fucking bridge then. JOHN F. - I pledge you that we shall neither commit nor promote aggression, that we shall neither flee nor invoke a threat of force. You may want to know how I got into this trouble, how I began wearing this mask. You wouldn't be surprised if I told you a girl was involved, let alone two girls were involved. Ten years ago, I met a woman named Lena. She has a daughter named Xstine. Ten years later, I can't even imagine how I ever lived without them. I relived my childhood with Xstine. She has been like a bridge to that timeframe. She has a father so that's not my role. She's just my favorite kid on the planet. This is me and my family on the beach with my mom and dad. I grew up fighting, not going to school, drinking at 7:00 am. I'm Puerto Rican-Argentine. I'm an actor now. I love getting into character. I've been trying to make it for a long time. My background doesn't help because it's too mixed. I came up when growing up in New York City was fun, where we Facebooked the streets, tags were real social experiences, our statuses were written on walls, rooftop graffiti, origin of the blunt. I was always a bit of an outsider. My girlfriend used to say, "My boyfriend looks white, "he's Puerto Rican and he acts black." Looks like a great memory. Well, my dad was an actor, too, and a magician. He disappeared shortly after that day on the beach. I was raised by my mom. When I grew up, I loved baseball. The funny thing about baseball, one swing could win the game. Sometimes everything is involved, hesitation and opportunity. Your choice, knowing when to swing. I always thought I'd be a ball player. I mean, I could mimic Mickey Rivers, Rod Carew, Roy White, Reggie Jackson, Mr. October. I never became a ball player, yet I'm still waiting for that big swing to win the game. - Hello. - That was weird. Get in. Who are you? I'm here to see Ron about Phantom of the Opera. Come in. We need people. - Ron. - Hey, Mary, let him in. - To the left. - What happened? Ron. Ron. Hello. - Hey, David. How are you doing? - Hey. How are you? You see all the kids around here? - I saw 19 people. - Outside also a few. A few are in their cars. This is a very, very popular deal you got going here. So, for you to be good, for you to get a shot at being in this, you gotta be the best. Well, I mean, I really liked the idea that I was like a... You're making, like, a horror film. You don't feel comfortable as a singer? I mean, I'm interested in playing the Phantom 'cause I'm going through a lot of stuff. I like your honesty. I'm a method actor. I really like getting into character, you know. Would you recommend that I, like, hurt my face at all for the role? Any actor who does that kind of method acting is an idiot. Why, uh, Phantom of the Opera? There's a saying in the Phantom, "Friend or father, phantom or angel." And I kind of feel like the world is a stage and he wants to give the world to her. Something like he didn't have. I want to give you a shot. I got a good feeling about this. I'm gonna bring you into the auditions. - Thank you. - But that's all part of the ball game. - Does it mean I'm hired? - Not yet. - Okay, okay, okay. - Don't jump the gun already. No jumping. All right. It means things are looking good. Go see Mary. Tell her what days, you know, work good for you. I'm surprised that you left the porn industry to make the Phantom of the Opera. I'm a big fan. Can I just take a picture with you? All right. Nice shot. Not bad. Romeo and Julio. That was weird. Her and Xstine are everything to me. Her brother's just been released from prison. He's got a piece of a restaurant in Bay Ridge, and he's got Xstine working after school like a slave. Ivan. And Lena is delaying me from meeting him. You're kidding me, right? I mean, what could go wrong? I mean, everybody likes me. ♪ While you were with me ♪ Your whistle broke, hon ♪ That's just the way you are but there's so much emotion ♪ How can you see the world... ♪ Hi. Fucking Marlon Brando and Paul Newman, right? It's my baby sister! When I walked into the barbecue, a fight broke out. It was a guy named Luca and his girlfriend... I mean, she looked like she could have been in ABBA. And to say you're sorry. I could picture her singing Dancing Queen. Why don't you just get the fuck out of here? You don't talk to me like that. Just get the fuck out of here. I'm gonna be with my friends. Don't you ruin my day. Get the fuck out of here. You don't touch me like that! Get the fuck out of here! Fucking chicks make me mad! ♪ Lead bullets left... What are you looking at? Why is she giving you a hard time? - Just get the fuck out of here. - I just gotta enjoy. - This is some funny shit, man. - What a dick. You always pick the right ones, don't you? I met Blaze, the Pistol, a Westie underboss that was under Uncle. Uncle saw him as a son since he came from Ireland five years ago. Blaze wound up in prison immediately, burning someone's car. Uncle had close ties with Ivan by Ivan's father, who passed away when Ivan was in prison. Uncle contacted Ivan and let him know that Blaze was in the lockdown, and asked him if he could look out for him, and Ivan did. When Blaze got out before Ivan, he was introduced to Luca, an Italian hitman that came in from Sicily. Luca and Ivan had been friends for years. These guys were called the odd couple, one from Italy and one from Long Island, both Italian. Since Blaze got out before Ivan, he was introduced to Luca, and they became known as the six-foot killers or U.N. gangsters. They burned down houses that wouldn't pay up to Uncle. Ivan has come out with a Colombian connection and wants to start a cocaine business using baby powder bottles as camouflage. You know what this is? - It's talcum powder. - No. It's 100% pure, uncut cocaine. Sealed and everything. Here. Try this. - Bye-bye, dickhead. - That's what I'm saying. Now that Ivan's out, the whole crew's completely together, they think they're gonna take over the world. I didn't know it yet, but I was stepping into the Twilight Zone. - So, he is an actor? - Yeah, he is an actor. - Stage actor or film? - Film, film. Yeah. You know, maybe this actor guy is a good guy and we can all just go back to the way things were. Yeah. I'm gonna give it a shot. He's... He's different. He's different. Different. Oh, yeah? Different how? He's just different. He's just different. All right. Maybe I need a different guy. What about Frank? Huh? Maybe you need a different guy. - What? - I'm an actor and I paint and stuff like that. You look at him, this guy, I mean, he looks serious, he's fucking kidding. If you step out of line, I'm not gonna be kidding anymore, and it's gonna be bad. And just when things got uncomfortable, in walks Andrew. Oh, there goes my friend. He studied to be a priest. I had known Andrew since he was about five. We grew up in the same building. When Andrew heard I was gonna meet her brother, he knew it was gonna be difficult, and he wanted to come cook and make things easy and try to make things smooth for me. Guys, give me a minute. Give me a minute. I don't think I rubbed Ivan the wrong way. On the contrary, I think he liked me. I hope he told you, right? No more beer, no more drinking, no more women. What the fuck am I doing? You know, I was gonna be a priest. - Really? - Yeah. I did the whole thing. I went to the seminary. I went, like, two weeks ago when you did the paperwork on it. - Real burgers. - I'm sorry. You said you were gonna be a priest? Get the fuck out of here. You almost smacked that girl in front of everybody. You think I don't have the look of a priest? Well, I mean, that seemed violent. Like a fucking pervert. She was the fucking devil. I'm gonna take a walk. I'll be opening up a ministry and helping out homeless kids. You know, that's what we need today, adults that care about the future. Hey, priest you got any ketchup? You want mustard, too? So, you got Chef Andrew in the house. Might be doing this for some... It's not really funny. I only went away for ten. I would have known you before. First, when we hit him... Hold on. Brothers and sisters, like Shakespeare used to say, imagine this backyard as a black forest, and all of y'all, eh, all of y'all are gonna be in a new music video.

Thank you, guys. You guys did well. Where's the fucking money? I don't know. I put it where you told me to. Did you put it in a fucking black bag under the bed like I said? I put it where you told me to put it. Wow! Nobody's fucking leaving here - until I get my fucking money. - What? - Fuck you! - Oh, really? Fuck you! I made you and I own you. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? When you get your hands on money like that, you fucking handcuff it to a suitcase. You got that? - Fucking shit. - Black bag. - Let's find that money, okay? - In a fucking black bag, the money. It's $100,000! - Calm down. - Listen, I just got out of jail. - I don't need this shit, all right? All right? - It was fucking David. It was fucking David that had the money. - That's my sister's friend. - I don't give a fuck who it was! Well, it wasn't him, all right? Calm down. Hey, guys, what you fighting for? - Come on. - Don't give me this shit. Don't give me this shit, all right? Everyone's here except for David. I mean, you trusted this dude. He looked weird. Money's missing. It's gotta be him, I'm telling you. - Relax. - It's gotta be him. The money's fucking missing! It's missing! It's gotta be him! Calm down! As of right now, my sister's not gonna see this guy anymore. It's over. If he took that money, I'm gonna whack him. After that. It took a while, but you like me. - Yeah, it took some time. - It took some time. It took a lot of time. Okay. You know why we're here, right? - Why? - Well, he stole the money. You know that, right? - No, he fucking did not. - I know it's him. He didn't. You break up with this guy, don't see him anymore. - Let us handle it. - I know he didn't! - Why are you blaming him for it? - He's the only guy that left early. You know this. He just left for no reason. He didn't argue with you, he didn't argue with anybody. Are you kidding me? He just left. Didn't even say goodbye. I know he has the money. I am not gonna stop seeing him. I need to know where he is, and I need to know now. You're not gonna do anything to him. You gotta stop being and airhead. You gotta listen to what I say. No, you are not. You have to leave this guy. If you don't leave him, you're gonna get hurt. - Don't do it. - He has our money. I'm gonna hurt this guy, I'm telling you. Don't make me do this. Just break up with him. I don't wanna hurt your feelings. You're gonna get hurt.

You don't wanna see this. No! David... where did you get the money for this ring? I got it from the Phantom. I'm just kidding. I know you've been working hard, and, um, I just wanted you to have something nice. David... Wait. I can't. I can't. - Why? - I just... I just can't. Can't what? - No, I just can't. - Can't what? What, 'cause your brother don't like me? Your brother comes out of jail and you walk away from me. Why? Why? Oh, come on. Really? 'Cause your brother comes out and he happens to not like me? I mean, that's a reason to leave? I brought Xstine balloons for her 17th birthday. David, you're not welcome here. You can't come here. You're not family, okay? I gotta go. Bye. Friend or father, phantom or angel. Don't you recognize your angel? Hi. Is this Phantom of the Opera? - Yeah, yeah. - Hi. Um, I'm playing Christine. Oh, nice to meet you. I'm playing the Phantom. When you play a role, no matter how hard you try, a little bit of that role slips into your blood. And when you've finished that role, you live the rest of your life with it. The character sometimes takes over. Why does everybody involved on this show hate your guts? I've had to defend you staying in the project. They're the ones that are hard to deal with, not me. You're a good-looking guy, you can act, you got charisma. Why can't you just take it to the next level? - Humanity. - That's the way I act. You gotta straighten up or you're gonna lose this job. - Okay, Ron. - Listen, this is a good job for you. - Don't blow it. - Yeah, I'm listening. Ron, listen, the guy you hired for Phantom of the Opera is scaring people. It has to stop. Maybe everybody is the problem, not him. Maybe he's perfectly fine and they suck. I pledge you that we shall neither commit... Action. All right. ...nor provoke aggression, that we shall neither flee nor invoke a threat of force, that we shall never negotiate out of fear, and we shall never fear to negotiate. You bought something, you just don't wanna tell me. - Nothing. - What are you talking about? - What is that? - Ta-da. Oh, my God. Are you serious? It's a gift. I appreciate it. That's nice of you. I know that you haven't seen your father since you've come from Europe. And, you know... I mean, I would never try to take his place. I mean, that's, you know... It's just I kind of feel like I'm like the Manhattan Bridge and you're like the Brooklyn Bridge and, like, you know, we're always gonna be in each other's lives. We're always gonna be around each other, we're gonna be parallel.

He didn't do anything! ♪ It's hard to reach out for the sun ♪ When a man is down in the hole ♪ - David, I'm so sorry. - What did I do? Are you related to her? Xstine, come upstairs. Copy, Lieutenant. 10-11. It was some of Ivan's connections at the police force that got me arrested. Lena got the charges dropped and I was able to go home. Lena then allowed me to meet them in the city to take Xstine to see the Phantom of the Opera for her birthday. I met them at Rockefeller and watched them from the side. And then to the Phantom. Come on, get together. Get together. - I like the jacket. - It's his jacket. Yes, I'm taking a video. - David! - She's a cinematographer. Hey, Xstine, do you have your ticket? But at the end, I couldn't leave the theatre with them because Ivan and his crew were picking them up. I'll meet you later. I just gotta go fix my hair in the bathroom. It's a little messed up. Here, take my jacket. I kind of feel like the Phantom now. And I'm trapped inside the theatre. This is the last day that I would see them for a while. This was the day that I became the phantom of her life. No, it seems that way. I'm, like, not her father. You're Puerto Rican, okay? You grew up with mostly black people, right? We grew up doing graffiti and break dancing. In her world, you will always be an outsider, okay? You always take these roads and you go too far with them. You put... You give too much into it. Let's take this shot. And this is to the soundtrack of the Phantom. My life is becoming like a movie. I'm gonna make you a soundtrack. That's exactly what I need. All right then, Phantom. Be easy out there. Don't let them get to you. Mr. Fate. I didn't think you was gonna make it tonight. Thought you knew my reputation. All right, let's get down to business. This is the guy, right here. - This guy. - This guy? We took that at the Copa. Look, man, you know the situation, you know this game. I need 5,000 now and I need 10,000 after it's over. What's going on with your mans right here with his knife and, uh, lemon? You all right there, Vlad? Boris. I think I speak for everyone in this room when I say, "Who gives a fuck?" You're insulting my brother! You got a problem, Vlad? It's Boris. MR. - Whatever. You liked that, right? - You're good. You're good. - You liked that, right? Now, let's go. Hey, David. How the hell are you? What's up? Good to see you. I haven't seen you for what? Roughly ten years. - Have a drink. - You want me to come and have a drink? - All right, let's go, let's go. - Come on. Hey, David. Come to Japan. I have cure for you. Tomorrow 6:00 a.m. Come to Japan. Yeah. David, come to Japan. Come to Japan, tomorrow 6:00 a.m. Shut up. He said actors can make a lot of money in Japan. In Japan, an actor like you is like Robert De Niro. New York City doesn't need you now. He makes a lot of money through commercials. What type of car do you drive? Well, um, I have a car. - Wouldn't you rather a Jaguar? - I'll go. Girls don't need you now, no one needs you now, we need you now. Time to go. And then, all of a sudden, shots rang out and we had to get out of there. Yo, Dave. David. You're home, man. Yo, Dave, get up, you're home. It's the address you gave me. All right, man. Have a good night, man. All right, cool. Dave. Dave, Dave. Yo! David. David, David. David. I almost forgot to give you something. I wanted to give you a gift. This sword has been in my family for generations. My great-great-great grandfather passed it on to his son, to his son, to his son, to my grandfather, to my father and to me. And now I wanna give this sword... You wanna give this sword to me? - Yeah. - Thanks. I want you to take great care of it. I'm fucking touched. Thank you, bro. I'm just fucking around with you, man. Shutaro just put that in the back of my car. I'm not trying to get in a DW. I'm fucking drunk, man. If I have this in the back of my car, if I get pulled over with this, what do you think the cops are gonna say? Well, listen, man, if the dragon ever blocks your path, I want you to slay it. Slay the dragon. You got it? All right, man. The sword... The sword is good with me. I'll take care of the sword, okay? I woke up with a banging headache. Those Japanese guys can drink. I got a call from Luca, that guy I met at the barbecue. - Hello. - Hey, David, it's Luca. Hmm? Luca, man, from the barbecue. How are you? I'm gonna meet the guys tonight. You come with us, we have a few beers, we chill. I think by the end of the night, man, everything will be cool. - We'll be like family. - Okay. All right. So, let's meet up at 8:00. - Where? - The Angelika, the movie theatre. Yeah, it's screening King Kong. - Okay. - See you there. I threw on Xstine's shirt for good luck. Even though these girls are not my family, they're all I've got. - Hey, David. - Oh, what's up? - What's up, man? - How are you, man? - Man, how's it going? - Good, man. Good. - Sorry I was late. - No, no, no, no problem. I got the guys there. We got a surprise for you. Yeah, you like surprises. What kind of surprise? Hey, how you doing? Good, good, good. These guys, man, they're like... They're movie buffs. They're like you. They like the old shit. Is he talking about me? They look like they're straight out of a Fellini film. All right, uh, we gotta go. We got a big night. - Hey, we're gonna meet Ivan? - Yeah, sure. So, what's on the agenda tonight? We're gonna be meeting Boris at this brothel. They got the Japanese action there. Japanese action? Man, they got everything. They even got bestiality for your ass. Man, I'm not going to any brothel. You know, you're gonna get a disease from those whores. Luca, these girls are professionals. Man, they're cleaner than your girl. Yeah, fuck you, man. - At least mine is hot. - You think some girl in the bar, she's fucking some low-life without protection? You fucking guys are crazy. "I'm new at this. I don't know anything." She gives you the best fucking blowjob of your whole life. Luca's girl is like that. Hey, fuck you. You know, I hope you get fucking AIDS. I already have it. Fuck that. I'm staying in the car with Luca. Fuck that. You're going in there. Hey, how come we don't have a piece of this action anyway? She's associated with politicians. We can't get involved with that so we're not even touching it. - I have to go... - Where? I gotta take care of this LL Cool J motherfucker. This prick owes me and has been avoiding me. Rock the Bells LL Cool J? Who is this guy? I thought they closed down the L train for two years. What the fuck are you guys talking about? He's gonna rock the last fucking bell tonight. This is supposed to be my night off. - What? - Hey, Screamin. - Yeah. What? - What happened to Doc? He can go to LL. Okay, I'll take you to him, but you can't hurt him. I don't want you to hurt him. I'm not gonna hurt your artist, I promise. Because, you know, really, I got... He's got to perform. - All right, well, let's go. I'm gonna trust you all. - All right. Where is the money? Where is our money? You said you were paying us back two weeks ago. Where is the money? Hey, hey, hey. Stop! You're hurting him. Just stop! No! This was just the taste of it. If you don't pay me, we're gonna come back in two days. I'll get you the money. You happy, motherfucker? Is that what you wanted? Well, you better make yourself comfortable tonight. You're gonna sing your last fucking song. Fuck you are. Man, it's hot. I wanna take off my shirt. So, what's the story here? Oh, they'll be out in a few minutes. A few minutes? I already know what I want. I want the madam. She runs the place. You can't have her. I can get what I want. She's the one that pretty much gets what we want. She can't run the place and attend to customers. What do you think you are, a pimp? She knows what she wants and she's gonna get it. You think so, Mr. Big Balls? Oh, he thinks so. They are just powdering their noses. So, can I entertain? You can. Come here. Tell me something original. I believe everybody has a price. You can't be in this game if you don't have a price. I think my price you couldn't afford. You're talking to the wrong man now. Oh, really? Yes. - Really? - Yes. Really? I don't think so. Girls! - Hi. - Would you look at this? Hi, guys. Como estas? Konnichiwa. I know what you want, baby, and you're going to get it. These here are the best in town. And you got to see this massage. It's the best seaweed pearl massage around. String of pearl massage. Yes! Oh, honey, the best massage. We've got the best massage with happy ending. Oh, the happy ending! Oh, yeah, baby, because I'm happy girl. You know that, right, baby?

Who the fuck did it? I did it. I fucking did it. I fucking did it. I did it. Hello. Hey, what's up? Oh, he's doing fine. Yeah, we're having a good time. Sure, all right. We'll stop by afterwards. All right, thanks. Bye. Yeah, I'm with your brother. Yeah. No. I mean... It's a lot of stuff. I don't wanna get into it right now, but, uh, I wanted to know if I could come see you and Xstine. Well, you know, I was offered that job in Japan for acting. And I'm gonna take it. I'm gonna go there for two months. I think I could at least see you guys before I go after everything I've been through. Come on. You're serious... What the hell? Call Mr. Fate now. Oh, this is what I get for not rolling with the professionals. Hey, get to the brothel now, like now. Yeah, I know. Change of plans. Change of plans. Oh, David, David, David. Where you going, man? We're gonna stop you right here. Show is over. - Where's the money? - Where's the fucking money, David? Let's leave, let's leave. Mr. Fate! Mr. Fate! The laser. We should have got it. My bad. Let's go. Let's go. I don't know who this guy is. He just gave me a bunch of band-aids, and he's offering to take me to a hospital. Give him something for the pain. Really? Yes, fucking really. Here, take this. It'll slow the pain down. Take him to Brooklyn. - Oh, that's right, they have my money. - ...and get your money. Fucking money. Shit. - You don't trust them. - I don't trust them either. We don't trust them, right? - They're going to kill you. - It won't happen. It's not happening. I'm faith. - I'm the night. - You are the dark. Now, I'm gonna give you this gun. And I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna get my money. I'm gonna get every single penny of it.

Well, first they killed your brother, now they wanna take away your girl, too? It's a basic revenge plot. And revenge is very addicting. Gentlemen, good evening. No, no, no, just sit. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about the shooting last night. Good evening indeed. Yeah, it was quite a mess. If it was such a mess, then why didn't you call it in? 'Cause I like to kill my own mice. You got mice in here? Let's go to the videotape, like Warner Wolf used to say. Oh, I see the little mice. Now I know why they say it's so difficult to get a table in here. I'll have to try to get a table here, too. Well, we have fresh food. Best ingredients. Are you gonna tell me you don't know any of these guys? Never saw them. Nope? You're always welcome to disclaim vetting, my man. I got my reservation. Boys, this here is a search warrant.

They were in my truck, but now what? We don't want any guns in the restaurant or on the block. They could be planning a fucking dragnet for us. Hell, they could be bugging us. - You think of that? - I'm shaking. Light this fucking peg up and call it a pernil. It's a pernil. Whatever happened to the luck of the Irish, man? I came back from Japan, I bought a Jaguar. And I know you're gonna enjoy it. Thank you. Congratulations. It seems that you always gotta go back to the beginning. I bought them two tickets to see the Phantom of the Opera. Shutaro came with me to get them. He dropped them off as a sushi delivery guy. Ace of Spades sushi. What the hell? Can I help you? Ace of Spades sushi. I didn't order any sushi. It's a delivery for you. Yeah, we did. What's the problem? - We ordered sushi. - Yes, delivery for you. Yes. All right, hold on. Let me get some money for you. Tip money. It's right here. This is for you. What, Jet Li don't like a dollar? Well, thank you for ordering and, uh... All right. Have a nice day. Shit. Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Have a nice day. Yo, Jay, you know, on the new cars, they don't have it no more, and I'm thinking, why not... Yo, that's my old car. You think I could put that on? Is there any way? You know what? They don't go on the new Jaguar, but where there's a will there's a way. Is, uh, Andrew here? - Andrew? - Come in. I was working with your friend. We worked together in our office at Brooklyn, in the same church. I was building a nice house. Just to give them a better life. Two months ago, two men come, maybe I think Irish and Italian. I'm sorry, your friend is dead. It's not the same anymore. I'm trying. Losing her must have been the hardest thing ever. She always wanted me to help people. I feel it. I found a place, you know. I'll pay it off. I'm gonna make it happen. I'm gonna help people. I mean, just like I lost it all. And how are you doing right for people? I'm getting it back, little brother. I'm recovering. You still got that picture of Jesus I gave you? Yeah. I never lost it. I'm gonna make it happen, you know? Open them doors 365 days, you know, 24 hours. A pair of sneakers or shoes. I'm gonna give it to them. They're gonna get what they need. Welcome to the bull fight, motherfucker. I heard about the tickets you got the girls. You know, the Phantom and then the skating rink. I guess I will be seeing you tomorrow, right? I am the matador and you're all bullshit. I am the matador. They're trying to trap me just the way they trapped the Phantom in the Phantom of the Opera. Luca is running this. Ladies, cool your jets. No lighting of anybody's ass tonight. Luca could knife the Pope in the freaking Colosseum and get away with it. No guns. This place is not the spot. Let the girls skate and the Phantom appear. They killed your best friend, and they want to take your women away. Who the hell is he to kill a priest? You're getting your girl, I'm getting my girl. - Damn fucking right. - Ready, man? Come on, David. It's time, man. Step right up. Check out the Top of the Rock. Man, I got this place completely surrounded. Top of the Rock. IVAN: I got my guys on the top, on the side...

One is pissed off at the other one 'cause he wants to be in charge. I can't believe this. Why is he in the restaurant? His dumb ass should be up there. Because he wants to be in charge and the other one wants to be in charge. Oh, my God. What the fuck is cockface doing in the restaurant? I'm watching you. - I'll see you above ground. - Go ahead. Get the fuck out of here. You see that? That's you. That's yours now. Which one? I'm... I'm coming. All right, all right, all right, I'm coming. All right. Who? Where? We gotta go.

I'm looking at you right now, asshole. - What? - Look across the ice. You're in the wrong fucking restaurant. The Sea Grill. But you're in the wrong fucking restaurant.

Just, just coffee. Look, all I'm asking for is coffee for a few minutes. We can discuss this, and that's it. That's it. That's all I'm asking. I ain't asking for much else. All right? Easy.

When I think of you, my heart burns a little hole and that drips all the beautiful memories into my bloodstream. I feel you running through me. Our hearts are one again. When you are far, I have to deal with you running around inside of me. When you are near, everything makes sense. The world is round again and my heart is whole. Masa, Shutaro. You thought this was gonna be over? You thought it really was gonna be over? - You fucking push three and it's over? - Come on! You fucker! You son of a bitch! Where the fuck is Shutaro? Fuck, man, Shutaro... What do you mean, fucking Shutaro? Don't you move. Don't you move. - Don't you fucking move. - Come on, shoot me. Fucking shoot me. Your brothers are motherfuckers here.

After school, Xstine became a mentor to one of the children at one of the local public schools. About five months later, I went to visit my brother the priest, and it brought back a lot of memories. Yo, David, wake up. Yo, them cats that shot you, they in the other room. Don't fucking move. I'll be back, all right? I'm gonna go get a wheelchair. Hey, kid, come here. That guy... Okay. He didn't turn green! Hmm. Then, like a movie, Ivan walked in. I guess he came to see Boris. Ironically, they were buried about 20 feet from each other. Are you serious? He's dead, man. He's dead. You got to put it in 401. Please rewind it. I wanna see what happened. All right. Can you rewind it? Right there, that room. Shit! A little kid just pulled the plug on his life machine right there. A little kid just killed him. Are you sure nobody else was in that room? There's nobody else in there. Come on, there's got to be somebody else in there. The little kid just walked in on its own? Yeah, it's just the kid. Oh, man. Yes, she gave me things. Things. Things. I mean, I know she was famous, but a fucking playbill? That's not love. - Excuse me? - How is that love? - She was a goddess. - Her family's in a state of shock. It's bad enough we lost our nephew to that Phantom. And now, our mother's gone. And you're crying about playbills? Yeah, yeah, I'm upset. - I flew in for a sibling brawl? - Oh, boo-hoo. I loved my aunt a whole lot more, - and I appreciated her a whole lot more than you. - I'll put you - in that fucking lake. - She was my role model. What are you, a woman? I'm a fag, but I'm not a woman. I took the train. Bravo to you. Look, she fucking crushed me. - "Crushed?" What the fuck are you talking about? - My mother. Maybe she was saying that everything she did she did was for you. That you were her star. When you came out, she was hard on you, but not for the reasons you think. You know, she didn't really want you to suffer. Yes! See the silver lining if you don't mind. And now, your nephew is dead. And you know what she would say now? Go psycho. Kill the bitch for Blaze. And find the young girl and David will follow, and kill him for Blaze! She didn't hate you. Her last words to me were, "I really loved him so much." Why the fuck didn't she tell me? She is a rose. Not from Spanish Harlem. Plucked straight from the rose bush. Well, it's complicated but simple. That's why you gotta be down with the king. - Too kind. - The real deal. Beautiful, sexy, smart, artistic. Oh, my God! Candy! The candy store, Uncle. - I won. - Wrapped in a bow. - FedEx. - We can handle it. If you don't, I will. Gentlemen, just find the girl.
