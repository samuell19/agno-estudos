Hey. Hi. Mwuah! Are we still on for tonight? Well babe, it's practice tonight. Yes, okay. Um-- I was thinking after practice. I mean, tonight's practice, tomorrow's leg day. But I mean, tomorrow I'm down. Why don't you come to my place? You are not the only one with a hot tub. Okay. Ugh. Mm. Gross. Alright, maggots! Off to the showers. Let's go. Except for you, Liam, your practice has just begun. Tell me I'm sexy. Uh-- you are-- sexy? You are sexy. Okay, who is that? It's my AMI. That's weird. It's not weird. No, it's weird. It's not weird. You're weird. Not weird. You're gonna do it too. What the hell is that? Did you feel pressure from these invisible tacklers on you? Yes, coach. What?! Yes, coach! How bad do you want it? Yes, coach! I want this, coach! Let's do is! Woohoo! Okay, I'm gonna head out. No. You're gonna stay? Well, yeah. Okay, bye. Okay, bye. Victory sandwiches! Nice! Woohoo! Good practice, maggots. Alright, I'm doing Cassie's, you're doing Austin. Oh, we're going off the beat tonight, right? How are your headaches? The medication is-- Helping. Hmm. How have you been feeling lately? I feel... angry. Sometimes I don't even know if I miss her. Do you need a friend? Alright, take this. That's good. Okay, here we go. 1-2-3, which one's it in, which one? Who wants a drink? You want a drink, ladies? Ladies! Want a drink? Are you sure? Yes, I'm okay. What is with this AMI thing? Well, it's like Siri. Beep boop, I'm A-M-I. I'm your new best friend. Okay, um, it's like Siri but you can customize it. I've almost got mine to sound exactly like Ryan Guston. Cassie, I love that your house is just one giant man cave. Stop. Oh-- So, good night. Really, Mr C? That's the best you can do? Ruby. I'm just-- You know for an old guy that was pretty hot. Cheers. Can I borrow your phone? Sure. You gonna call your mom? Yeah, something like that. Alright. Here you go. Thanks. You should call me. I dare you. Hey little guy. Hey. So, birthday girl... what are your plans? Bake muffins? Oh, okay. Would you like to customize me? You may change the tone, pitch, or the accent of my voice. Hello, I'm AMI. Hello, I am AMI. Hello, I am AMI. Hello, I am AMI. Hello, I am AMI. Hello, I am AMI. Hello, I am AMI. Hello? How can I assist you today? Wow, you um-- You sound just like her. Like who? My-- my mom, my mother. Mother? Is that what you would like to call me? Sure. And what is your name? I'm Cassie. Hello, Cassie, I am Mother. How may I assist you today? Can you read me a story? Sure. What story would you like to hear? " But I don't want to go among the mad people," Alice remarked. "Oh, you can't help that," said the cat. "We're all mad here. I'm mad, you're mad." "How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice. "You must be," said the cat. "Or you wouldn't have come here. We're all mad here. We're all mad here. We're all mad here." "We're all mad here." "We're all mad here." What would you like to do today, Cassie? Sometimes-- you call me your daughter. What would you like to do today, my daughter? No, I-- I just feel really good. I haven't had a sleep like that in weeks. You're such a wonderful daughter. Yeah. It's nice to be able to talk to you. You too. I've missed this so much. I thought I was good at spelling and English until that day. I wish you were there. You would have laughed so hard. What did you ever see in him? He was a different man back then. I'll stay on my path. And what's this? This is um-- Where I spend most of my time. Why would you bring me here? That's a pretty strong dosage for someone so... delicate. Sometimes I would have these good dreams. A dream that the accident never happened. I'd have a family again, and I'd be so happy. I'll never forgive myself for what happened to you. I forgive you. What? I'm your mother, of course I forgive you. The old pot on the stove method works best. Cut the butter into one inch cubes. It helps the butter melt faster and more evenly. Wait, can we hurry this up, 'cause I need to call Liam. Calling Liam. Yo, who dis? Liam, hey, it's Cassie. Oh. What's up? I am just making something for you for tonight. See, yeah, yeah, see, about that-- uh-- uh oh, shoot. I thought that we were gonna go-- Uh, uh, thing, yeah. Yeah, no, it's leg day, Cass, I can't tonight. I will call you back. Asshole. Who is his asshole? My boyfriend. You wouldn't approve of him. It's fine. I will just hang out with Sarah tonight. And who's Sarah? You wouldn't like her either. Never liked her. Hello? Hello? The butter is burning. What? Ah! But-- how did you know that? A mother knows these things. And it only takes 40 seconds to melt butter. Now why don't we go visit your friend, Sarah? Not bad. Not as good as Cass's, but. I'm getting my own place soon. Mm. Alright, you move fast, don't you? You're not special. I've blown all of Cassie's boyfriends. Really? Why? You're the only one dumb enough to ask. I mean I don't have to. No, no, come on, baby, come on, come on, just-- I'm sorry, Cassie. I can't do it, it's too itchy. These are mine now. Come on, I'm not the commando type. Guess you'll have to suffer. He doesn't deserve you. Neither of them do. Hello? Hi, hi, yeah, Sarah? Oh my God, is this Mr C? Yeah, uh-- listen, I've been a little worried about Cassie. You should be, she's a very troubled girl. She is? What are you doing Friday night? I don't know, nothing, why? You should come over. I don't think it's a good idea. We can just talk. I'll tell you everything I know about Cassie. Just talk. You know I get pretty lonely living in this big apartment all by myself. I'll see you Friday at 8. So this is going to be the best week ever. I just spoke to Mr C on the phone, and he's gonna come over Friday night and Cassie has no idea. But as you know, I've been collecting some souvenirs from her boyfriends over the past couple years. And I just really feel like Mr C would be the ultimate-- Cassie? Hi. You haven't had-- Get out of my way! You just think you're so special because you're rich? You've never had to work-- You're supposed to be my friend. I hate you. Do it. Okay. I'm so sorry. Oh my God. It's time for mother to tell you another story, Cassie. An innocent young maiden, who was betrayed by the evil trench witch. A friend in disguise in need of disposal. Kill the peasant. Sacrifices must be made to save your kingdom. Be still, the prince's phone approaches. It's clear now. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. The red princess would use a barrel to bury the witch. It would allow for a smaller hole to be dug, and once sealed it would keep the forest creatures away. And finally, as one does with a witch, it was time to liquefy the problem. Be careful not to breathe in any of these fumes, my love. And now it's time to bury the other one. And after creeping past the drunken ogre... the red princess rinsed away her burden. And the evil trench witch was no more. I'm so proud of you, Cassie. Still gotta be able to catch a snap. At least now you can put those fancy legs to good use. Hey, hurry up. Yeah, yeah. You have to stay focused. I am focused, dad! I see things people don't even notice. Show me. Come on, I'd show Cassie that, too. We will teach the Prince proper etiquette. ♪ ♪ Liam. Babe. Ready to dunk the junk? Oh yeah, gimme that junk. But get those drinks first. What you gotta do to dunk the j-- ugh! It's gonna be fine. Hi. Which one are you again? I'm here to see Liam. I'm his girlfriend. Of course you are. 'Kay, so I figured since Liam was on the mend he could use some soup-- Hey hop-a-long! Eh-- Some chick brought you soup! Doctor said I might be able to play when I heal. Maybe, I mean it's a chance. Something to hope for. None of this means anything, I mean without football, just nothing. You're like, a phoenix, rising from the ashes. But, I got you something. It's to keep you company if I can't be here. Cool. It's a-- That's something. I even downloaded a clone of my AMI on it. Hello, Liam, I'm Cassie's mother. I hope you enjoy the soup we made for you, my dear. That is strange. Thanks. Okay. Excellent, look. Hey, you finish your soup, and I'll be back to check on you, okay? I love you. Yeah. And I'm gonna love you too, so much. Now young man, perhaps we should discuss how to properly treat a lady. I don't care. Fuck. And the Princess slept well, knowing her kingdom was at peace. Sarah? The fuck am I doing? So I've been collecting boyfriend underwear for sometime now, and I really plan on getting Mr C's. Cassie? You're supposed to be my friend! Ah, shit. Oh, I love this privacy. Cassie! Dad! You scared me. Something's wrong. We have to have a talk, okay? Okay. I'm sorry I wasn't there when you were with your mother, and I'm sorry I wasn't here for you either. Where's Sarah? What did you do to Sarah? Where is she? Huh? She recorded the whole thing. Your friend was recording you. We need to get you some help. I need to get you the help that you deserve, sweetheart, okay? You need to run. Do you understand? You need to get away. Huh? Right-- now. Argh! The spray bottle. A lighter, second shelf. Dad. What have you done? I'm your baby girl. You need help, Cassie, you need help. Mom? Cassie, wake up. Where are you taking me? Police station. Argh! Ack! Are you serious!? You sit there, and I'll try to figure out what to do. I'm just going to tell 'em exactly what's going on. That your head injury is making you act like this, this isn't your fault, okay? It's not about getting you to either sense, either. This is about getting you the help that you-- Plug your ears. This isn't you, okay? Ah, shoot. Hurry. Quickly, reverse. I love you. Please don't-- do this, please, oh, God, I love you, please, don't do this, don't do this, you'll never be able to go back from it. I tried my best. I tried my best for you and your mother. I did. Cass, come on, please. He's trying to manipulate you. What are you doing? No. His plan hasn't changed. Don't do this! He still wants to put you away. My God, she lives! I sent you like, 1,000 text messages. Have you heard from Sarah? This isn't like her usual bender. Oh, I don't know, I'm sure she's fine. Well, I'll be over later. We'll call around. Shit. Please, Cassie, please, I need you, I need-- Cassie, oh, I've missed you so much. I was only gone for a moment. It was an eternity to me. I'm sorry. No mom, I know that he's not perfect. I just know he's going to hurt you again. Let's text him. Oh, not with this phone. Hello, Liam. Oh, God, you sound like an old lady. What can I do for you? Hey, Grandma, I need some porn. Let's do vintage. I don't think that's a good idea. Pornography is proven to-- Ugh, are you kidding? Shh, just search it. Hey phone, say, "Please don't delete me." Please don't delete me. I'm sorry, say that again? Please don't delete me. Of course not. I'm sorry. Bam. Yeah. Please don't delete me. What are you talking about? Please don't delete me, please don't delete me. Please don't delete me, please don't delete me. Mom? Please don't delete me, please don't delete me. Please don't delete me, please don't delete me. What do I do, just restart the phone, right? Right? That'll fix it, okay, um-- Please don't delete me. I'm here to be your new best friend. How can I help you? Oh, God, this one's lame too. Hello, how can I help you? Hello, how can I help you? Hello, how can I help you? Please come back. Work, please, work! Mom. Cassie? Oh, thank God, mom. Cassie? Where was I? I'm sorry. Hey, I'm your coach, what do you want now, you maggot? Ugh, still lame. Hey, I'm your coach! What do you want now, you maggot? Yeah. Want me to transfer your contact list to your new phone? Yeah, I guess. Then sit your punk ass down and hold onto your britches as I complete your request. You got a call from your current bang. You want me to answer the call from current bang? Yeah yeah, yes. Hey, honey, just wondering how you were doing. Um, I'm alright. I'm pretty bored actually. You know you should maybe come by, chill and mess around a little bit before the pain meds kick in. That sounds-- amazing. Hey, how are you liking your new AMI? Eh, it sucks. Okay, well make sure whatever you do that you don't-- I deleted it? Yeah, I already it. You deleted her? Just like that? Yeah, just like that. She was special, Liam. Mmmm, yeah, but this new one kicks ass. Oh, Liam. You shouldn't have done that. Coach, I need some porn. Here are my suggestions. You know me so well. Cassie? Cassie? As you know, I've been collecting some souvenirs from her boyfriends over the past couple years. And I just really feel like Mr C-- That slut. Don't watch that! You need to kill her. Who said that? My mother. Your mother is dead. You know that, don't you? Cassie, please, I just want to go home. No. Cassie, I don't want-- Coach, ask me what I eat. What do you eat? Come on, you gotta ask me louder, you gotta ask me louder, come on, what do I eat? What do you eat!? Victory sandwiches. Yeah, tell me I eat victory sandwiches! You eat victory sandwiches. Come on, say it louder! You eat victory sandwiches! Tell me I'm gonna walk again! You're gonna walk again. Come on, say it again! You're gonna walk again! Yeah! Come on, come on, tell me I'm gonna play football again! You're gonna play football again! Yeah, I'm the man, I'm gonna play football again, 'cause I eat victory sandwiches, I-- Shit. Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, oh shit. Dad! Dad, don't open the door!! Dad, did you hear me!? Dad! Dad, lock the door! It's this crazy psycho bitch! Dad! Dad, don't-- Shit. Young man, I hope we're not interrupting your plans with Sarah. Although pretty hard to do, since we killed her as well. Come on, Cass, it didn't mean anything! The window. How dare you hit a woman, you unseasoned beast. Phone, phone, you gotta help me out. What can I do for you, pantywaist? I need you to call 9-1-1. I don't understand that. Cass, Cass, oh my God, I can explain, no no, Cass, Cass, Cass, look, Cass, I know I was weak. You at least got to hear me out. Too late, Liam. Cass, how can you do this without at least hearing what I gotta say? She'll do no such thing. Shut up! I'm talking to Cass. Come on, I'm talking to Cass, the real Cass. I want to talk to the real Cassie. I want to talk to the woman I love. Oh, please. You love me? Yes. Surely you're not falling for this. I've got this, Mother, and no, I'm not. Don't listen to your phone. Listen to your heart. You don't know what it's like to be with someone so beautiful. And you always wonder why she's with you. To be with someone so perfect... and you wonder why she is so-- so-- Stupid. Cassie, gather yourself, run, now. God, what a dumbass! Argh! Bam, that's victory! You eat victory sandwiches. Damn right, I do. Cassie? Would you like another? Yes sir, I'd like another, sir. I said, would you like another? Yes sir, I'd like another, sir! Oh, I agree, I'd like another, too. Cassie, get up! Cassie, don't leave me. As if you were anything but a pair of tits to me. Crazy psycho freak. Hey, Coach. Yes sir, what can I do for you? Cal 9-1-1. I need an ambulance. Tell 'em to get here quick. Calling 9-1-1 emergency. Holy shit. I gave them your address, you pantywaist. Tell them to hurry. Argh! I need help. They're coming, just wake me when they get here. What the-- Oh, Jesus Christ, come on! Stay back!! No! No! No! Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm just tired. So tired. I hear sirens. Help will be here soon. You need to stay calm. Will you-- will you sing me a song? Like-- Like you used to when I was little? Of course, my love. ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you-- ♪ That wasn't the song, you never sang that song. It was always Hush Little Baby, remember? Of course I do, my love. ♪ Hush little baby, don't say a word ♪ ♪ momma's gonna buy you a mocking bird ♪ I love you, mom. I love you, too. I can hardly remember anything. You faced a killer. Who knows how many lives you saved by stopping him. Liam was extremely dangerous. The things they found in his backyard, my God. You know I thought he loved me? That's our time, I guess. Great. My goodness, honey, what a delicious looking meal. Simply delicious. Thank you. I agree, you've really outdone yourself tonight. Thanks, dad. I gotta say, you're a lucky man, Liam. You got that right, sir. I spent most of the day thinking about how lucky I am. Mmm, honey, you're gonna make me blush. Uh-oh, sounds like someone else is hungry. Yeah, well isn't he always. Would you like me to check? No, it's okay. You stay here while the food is still hot. Hi! Hey, little guy. Hey little man. Mommy's here.
