ESIMESAC Back then, in my village, families popped kids by the dozen. The only form of contraception was postponing delivery. Mrs. Gelinas carried her last one a long, long time. Then he was born. He was strong. Real strong. But he was missing the one thing that always follows you everywhere. He had no shadow. Except for his sister Marie, who perched on him like a bird, to teach her brother to fly. What's for dinner, Mom? Misery, as much as you can eat. Same as yesterday. The house specialty. Where's your sister? Marie, supper! The house specialty. - Can you plant... - Stop! - Hot water? - Yup. And salt and stale bread to dunk in it. As long as the family's together. Yeah. Misery loves company, as you know. GENERAL STORE Beer and Flies Supper, dear. Does your calendar balance? Hard times seem to drag on forever. A crust of bread. - We're done for. - Come, come. This too shall pass. - Eat up. - Things were going so well. What went wrong? It's the financial crisis. It must be real, everyone says so. Crisis, sure. But what about the butter? A financial crisis doesn't dry up a cow's milk faucet. I love you. Our garden had better grow, or we'll be in trouble. Garden? We haven't sowed it yet, Mom. But, some people don't even have misery to eat. Everyone's in the same pot. Was it always like this? You're born and then starve the rest of your days? Esimesac, you never knew the good times. You're only two. Why's he the oldest if he was born last? I carried him longest. I remember when we ate our fill. Me too. You're short, Meo. I'm not asking for charity, you know. Mark it down, I'll pay later. No credit. Do you cut hair on credit? Long hair, you can ignore, but hunger gnaws at you. I've nothing to eat, so I have to drink. - Another pint, Hubert? - No, I'm broke. A glass? - No thanks. - A thimble? - Pour me a nip. - Coming up. The blacksmith buys flour. The smithy's different. He's rich as the queen thanks to the bomb skirts he makes. Bomb skirts? Bombshells, for the war. Says he'll pay with produce. Problem is my garden doesn't produce. Then let's go grow our gardens. We could pool together. It's true we each work our own plots. I say, instead of division, we should try addition. Addition? Addition, Toussaint. Yeah, pool our tools and sow one big garden. One big manure pile... You're good at weeding, he's free in August... Let's do it! If everyone pitches in to help, the sum will be greater than our separate totals. You lost me, but it makes sense. It's strength in numbers. Whoever wants to eat this Fall, join me tomorrow behind Garceau's. Come on, Marie. Sure is smart for a kid born last year. It's 'cause he's old for his age. And he sure is strong! Look, the queen has a nosebleed! He can make England bend. Not a shadow of a doubt. Easy for him, he has no shadow. - Hubert! - What? Don't say that. The Good Lord didn't give him one. Sorry. A shadow's size often matches the pride of the person who wears it. The village blacksmith was famous as the strongest man in Saint-Elie de Caxton. But the only opinion he truly valued was that of his daughter, Anna Domini. We'll plant Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, french fries, and baked potatoes. - Baked potatoes? - Sure thing. Sow 'em in tin foil. We'll plant peppermints... Bottles of gin, cans of soup... We'll plant... Apples of your eye, jelly and pie. Sacks of flowers and oats... Horse slippers and pigs' ears... For happy boys and girls! Can we grow whatever we want, Esimesac? The fruit's not in the seed, but how you grow it. Here's to how you grow it! Some say nothing will grow. Too stony, the soil's poor. We'll clear them stones. - To the stones! - Quit toasting, and start destoning. I'm going to plant carrots, OK? Perfect, Marie. Anna? Yes, Dad? Look how shiny it is. A new penny? No, an old nickel I straightened. Fine work, don't you think? Very nice. Money's lost it's glitter? It's not worth more because it shines. I work for a living. I'll earn a buck for this nickel. I know you have to work. Like everyone. What do you mean? They're all clearing a field to make a community garden. They're working too. A community garden? I don't want you involved. Growing iron is a better bet! As long as I make bomb casings, we won't go hungry. - Mr. Riopel. - Our new priest... Where is this famous garden that the parish is toiling over? The garden? Over there, fourth field on the right. Just behind the Garceau place. Have they boondoggled you too? I was asked to bless the seeds. Esimesac drafted you for his big green dream? - Not at... - I'm fond of team sports. But sowing seeds in a gravel pit is a waste of time. It wasn't Esimesac who asked me, it was your daughter. You mean Anna? I always wondered, do seeds grow better if they're blessed? Does that mean the crop is pre-blessed? You re-bless it before the harvest. Just as I thought. It's like applying a blessing primer. I don't know if I can move it. I'm sure you can, Esimesac! No shortage of sunshine here. Not a cloud since May. Somebody must've left their rosary on the clothesline. Did you try hanging out wet clothes? Whenever my mom put out her laundry, it rained. We even asked the witch to summon rain. Nothing. Her spells are weaker since Babine joined the circus. Well, that's another story. Ready. Come, Marie. - Go, Esimesac! - You can do it. Think of all the hungry mouths. That'll give you strength. Holy cow, he's strong! Still amazes me. No shadow, lots of muscle. His little sister told me he's so strong, you don't smell his farts, you taste 'em. Been playing in the sandbox? Didn't I tell you not to? You should come too. - Esimesac says... - Esimesac! Think he's going to save the world? He doesn't spend his days shining pennies! Nothing's ever grown in this soil. Hoe it alone or together, it's nothing but rock. Our land inspires our dreams. Can't wait to see you eat dreams come winter. Franks and dreams, pebble pie... A bitter burp. A cavernous belch. You don't understand! We need a gizmo to fetch water. A gutter or something. No, we need a water tank. Yeah, a 20,000-gallon tank. - 20,000 gallons? - Yup. How you going to fill it up? With water from the river. You'll lug a pail that size? You're going to haul 20,000 gallons by hand? We can. Sure. You can lug a lake on your shoulders. I can try. So how much are you ready to pay for this watering can? You know we have no money. You have no money. I have no time to waste on your pipe dreams. I don't like school. You have to study, Marie. I don't want to. I want to garden and tend to my carrots. - You'll see your friends. - School's no fun. I'm hungry. There are no games to play. No games? Not a single one. Come with me. Why are you so upset about a watering can? The village needs your help! A village helps those who help themselves. - I have you to feed. - You're jealous! Jealous? - Of who? - Esimesac! Why'd I be jealous of your savior? Many people say he's strong. Many people are starting to think he's the real strong man here now. But sweetheart... Just because he can bend a nickel? I can unbend 'em all, but I don't brag about it. You're not falling in love with him? It's Diese I love, Dad. And Diese is at war. The same war you make bombs for. Esimesac is my friend. What in creation...? Impossible. He'll never be able to. He's stronger than anyone. Is he now? Is he? You're no longer the strongest man here, smithy. Think so, Toussaint? I'll show that kid of yours. Cool your horses. You're all against me. Even my daughter. I'm not against anyone. I didn't even help 'em. I'll settle his score, show him who's boss! Smithy, you don't mean a fistfight? A fistfight's pointless. I'll challenge him at checkers. I'll knock him off his board. We'll do it in my garage! A championship, like in the old days. For the right to wear the belt. Like they said, the strongest man in the world! No problem with that, Lorenzo. But if you're risking your title, how 'bout wagering a water tank? Whatever you want. The belt and your can! At Lorenzo's next Monday. I'll show you who's champ. And try not to blink, 'cause it'll be over fast. Happy boys and girls! Dreams and more dreams and the wisdom of Marie, who slept with one eye open to go on dreaming the next day. Without water, the wind will blow the garden away. If my brother can move a small mountain, he can make water flow. Was he always that strong? Mom says having less shadow gives him more strength. I think he's too transparent. The sun passes through. My dad's strong, but... light doesn't pass through. WORLD'S STRONGEST MAN I need some hair. Last time you ordered some hair, you set the church ablaze. It's for a scarecrow. I don't have time. Just put a hat on it. And? The checkers lessons? You really mean to go ahead with the match on Monday? Why not cancel while you still can? Up to you to make a champion of him. We need that tank. The way it looks, the smithy will take his pieces before Esimesac's laid 'em out. He'll make it to king row and crown him good. I'll crown him good! What are you doing, Esimesac? I'm taking his pieces. Not backward! You're going backward! In Saint-Elie, my boy, you jump 'em going forward! Never backward. Never! - OK, I'll try. - There's no trying. You gotta be the best. The village is counting on you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Deziel's Garage on this historic night. Well, I guess you're ready. So go for it! Why? Aren't you coming with me? We're missing one of our contestants, but it shouldn't be long. You don't understand. Are you that scared? The blacksmith... He's a client of mine. Tonight smithy Riopel, reigning champ for as long as there's been one, is putting his podium on the line! In the corner with the red pieces, a true giant among his fellow men, a craftsman whose heavy hammering has left him with arms so long that he can scratch his knees without stooping. Ladies and gentlemen, the reigning champion, the blacksmith... In the corner with the black pieces, a young recruit. A team player who never backs down despite all obstacles... The man whom many call the town's new strong man, the contender for the gold belt... I give you... Esimesac.. Gelinas! Remember, guys... Play fair and there'll be no trouble. No blows below the belt. No jumping backwards. Contestants, shake hands. A sodbuster who plays checkers... None of that now, guys! Sit down! Where's Meo? He won't come in. I officially declare the checkers match... on! Go, Esimesac! Nice going, son. That farmer doesn't have a chance. I told you it would end badly. Are they going to keep playing? They can't reset the board. They'll call by decision. Ladies and gentlemen... Contestants, please... Everyone here tonight can boast of having witnessed an unprecedented demonstration of strength. An exemplary match! Exemplary? As an example of jumping backwards? In accordance with the judges' decision, the winner is... nobody. The match is declared... a tie! Come on, my boy! No way! - How...? - He cheated! He cheated! He was losing! - He started it! - So what? - He cheated! - That was the judges' call. I've a pebble in my shoe. How'd you get it? I dunno. Do your trick! Please! Ladies and gentlemen, keep your eyes open! The stone in her boot I will turn into soot. Let's go to garden. It wasn't about the title. They wanted a tank. To water their garden. I don't buy their field of dreams. I'll talk to them, it may help. I hope so. That's why I asked you here. I'm tired of bombshells. Making things that are going to be blown up. I can help you change careers. I hope so. Me, the way I see it... Tie or no tie, the smithy lost. He lost half of what Esimesac won. Don't bother repeating. I still won't understand. It was a tie game. We should be reimbursed. It was free. So what? It's the principle. Hello, men. Hello. Folks, lemme introduce the train man. He has something to tell you. Ladies, gents... Soon you'll hear the steam monster whistling... hauling wagons from the big city, each one crammed full. I'm here to warn you to get ready. You mean the train's coming to our village? We don't have details of the line, or the names of the villages where it'll stop, but... anything's possible. Montreal, Berthier, Louiseville, Yamachiche... There might be a stop at Saint-Elie. It'll stop either here or in Charrette. That cow pat doesn't deserve a station. If you help us build the railway, perhaps you'll get a station too. But what can we do to help? Come work on the site. We always need men. It's too far away. We can't just leave. We have a garden to tend. I'm just saying, picture for yourselves: Saint-Elie de Caxton Station. So you worked all alone in the garden today? I only won half the tank. Can't carry water in that. I failed, Mom. Even without a shadow, or a belt, you're the strongest man for me! Acorns? They're nuts after all. They're full of protein. Mom, can I have a dessert? - No, no dessert. - Why can't I have one? I ate everything. My plate's empty. Of course your plate's empty. There was nothing on it. Listen, kids, we'll soon harvest the garden. The blacksmith wants you. The blacksmith? I'll eat my acorn on the way. Look, I know... A garden's fine and dandy... and the harvest, when it comes. But folks want to eat, Esimesac. Folks are hungry now. And the train's steamed into the picture. While you're gardening... me, I figured, if I produced their rails, maybe they'd bring the trains here. Trains filled with grub. I'm sure you can do it, smithy. We can do it. I can't do it alone. That's why I asked you over. I'll need your help, Esimesac. Let's bury the hatchet. We're the town's strong men. It's up to us to save it. How can I help? There he is. Come on. Mr. Railroader... Mr. Riopel, what brings you here? I came to say... See, I'd like to.. Help build your railway. I can furnish rails, spikes... All the ironware you might need. How? At the lowest prices anywhere. Easy, there. Look, Mr. Riopel, I appreciate your interest, but... a small forge like yours can't compete. You need heavy machinery to make rails. We can do it. You do handicraft. Those days are long gone. No offense, but I'm sure you can't do it. You see, I've outfitted myself now. Hope you didn't invest much. What did you get? If you offer the same quality, for less than what we're paying, we'll buy everything you produce. Does that guarantee us a station? I'd bet my bottom dollar. You look a bit pale. You should go home. My little brother's not back. He left with the smithy. Not much you can do without water. I'm waiting for my brother. To the Saint-Elie de Caxton station! What's on your mind? Your shadow, smithy. It's big, huh? Is it big because of your position in the light? No, it's not that, Esimesac. It's how you position yourself in here. Mom says I never had one. Maybe they cut it when I was born. The shadow of yourself. I'll never have one. There's no shame in that, son. To prosperity, Esimesac. And better days for the village. The first batch is almost ready. We'll show that railroader. It's ready. Load it with the others. Everyone's in the garden. Why aren't you helping? They can manage on their own, Marie. And ending our misery? I'm working to bring the train. Gardens are nice, but you can't count on a harvest. With the train, we'll always have food. - Pooling our totals? - I want a train! - Strength in numbers? - Cut it out! Well, eat your train alone. I saw Anna today. A fine lass, huh? She's beautiful. Don't get your hopes up. Her heart belongs to Diese. The soldier who went missing at war. Maybe he won't come back. She's full of light, but her dad casts a long shadow. When he goes by, it's like an eclipse. He comes in the room, sets to work, and darkness descends. Spreads over the floor, the walls, the tools... blackness everywhere. Maybe 'cause he's so strong. Sure. The world disappears when he goes by. - A black hole. - Holy moly! You're no less a man than he. Look at me, Toussaint. What? A shadow doesn't make a man. Looking at you, I like what I see. You could get a big one, bigger than his. The witch will hitch you up with one. She knows the shadow world. She can foreshadow, eye shadow... She's one shady lady. A denizen of the dark. Call a shade a spade. Madame? I was expecting you. Come in. What can I do for you? I need a shadow, Madame. A shadow? You can't just conjure a shadow. You have to find it. Once you have one, it follows you everywhere. It can become a burden. I'm told you can help. Do you really need help? I want to be like everyone. It'll be good for me, I think. Hand something over. I need something of yours. You look rumpled! Tell me, is that a shadow or a gin bottle cork? Is it new? It's mine. It's my shadow. It's an acorn shadow. An acorn? You know, oak trees... Somebody playing a joke? Leave him alone, Dad. You'll see, it'll grow into a tree. It'll be bigger than yours. Thanks. Sure ain't much to look at right now. It's not the size, it's what you do with it. Well, you could've chosen a maple... We'd make maple syrup. An acorn! Come on, move that rail! What is it, guys? Something's bugging us. - What do you mean? - Bugs... You know, beetles. An invasion, overnight. In the potatoes, everywhere. We need your help. Give me a minute. Never come in here without knocking! Sorry, smithy. The guys need me at the garden. No way. We have 200' of rails to produce, pronto. Can't they herd their radishes themselves? We have a railway to lay. Send 'em packing and get cracking! I can't come. Too much to do. Not all day, just an hour or two. I can't. Let me work! Did the witch put that on? It's a shadow. An acorn shadow. An acorn shadow? C'mon, let's let the a-hole work. Some guys never finish what they start. Big oafs from little acorns grow. Sorry for tearing your head off. The railroader's breathing down my neck. Y'know, I like gardens. It's a great idea. But men, real men, like us, are meant for bigger things. I know, you're right. He said he'll pay us when the work's done. But here's an advance. It's not much, it's out of my pocket. I'll pay the rest when he pays me. Go on, back to work. Thanks, smithy. I have a shadow now, Marie. Shall I tell you a story? When the train comes, the cars will be loaded with Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, french fries, baked potatoes, peppermints, spices. Bottles of gin, cans of soup, Apples of your eye... Jelly and pie... Sacks of flowers and oats... Horse slippers and pigs' ears... Happy girls and boys. Show me your shadow. Just watch. I don't know if I recognize you. It's the same old me. Go to sleep. Good night. Good night. Even the brightest ambitions have shady patches where angels fear to tread. You work like a machine. It's all for the Saint-Elie train station. Give this to the smithy. It's hopeless. There's too many beetles. Look. Her pains are starting. The teary season's upon us. Nights will get shorter, days longer. Midlover's night. Just like I said today. Her pains are back. We suffer her suffering. She's a suffragette. Anna Domini, you have to stop bawling. You're keeping the whole village up. My love doesn't love me, Daddy! What do you mean? The petal of love fell down the drain. What? Not your petals again, Anna? A petal down the drain doesn't mean anything. It's not an official superstition. Diese doesn't love me any more. He fell in love with a girl at war. Look, you dropped your flower in the sink... Stop your sniffling, wipe your nose and go back to bed. Guys, you can stay up as late as you like. We haven't slept in a week. Haven't slept through the night once. Feels like a deconcentration camp. You could save her, Esimesac. What can I do? She won't even listen to her father. Pull out her petal. Her petal? From the sink. It's down the drain. I don't know if the smithy would like to find Esimesac with his girl in the middle of the night... C'mon, the smithy's just his boss. He won't sleep with her. Get the petal from the pipe. But he's no plumber. Nothing to him. He can haul boulders and lift rails. He can put a petal to the metal. Come on! I'll go console her. In exchange, if I succeed, I want everyone to help make rails at the forge. What about the garden? There's not a spud in sight. Our future's in the railway. Stay here. Don't budge. When I say, hold your breath. Don't move. Thank you. You deserve a piece of my heart. Thank you. Thank you too. Now everyone's been thanked. I think you can go home now. Thank you. You're late, Esimesac. I have workers. Brawn and determination. They're willing to help. - You know I can't pay you now. - No worries. Our wages can wait if it brings the station to Saint-Elie. Well, if you insist... - No, I don't insist. - Alright! Form three groups. One to saw, one to weld, and one to drill. You slept well, I can see. For the first time in his life, Esimesac was proud. And since shadows follow suit, his had puffed itself up a bit. I'm happy for you, son. Things seem to be going well. Marie's coming down with something. What's wrong? She's sprouted a dozen feathers. On her arms and now on her back too. Did you call the doctor? We're broke, Esimesac. We've nothing to eat. How can I pay a doctor? The kids are hungry, Marie's ill. I can take a lot, but... I don't know what to do. Here, Mom. Go to Toussaint's. Not enough for the doctor, but you can buy flour and lard and molasses. She'll get better if she eats. You're all dolled up. Prosperity's coming. I want to look my best. Meo's giving perms on credit. We'll have to pay him eventually. The train, Toussaint. When people pay back what they owe us, we'll be rich. We have to do our share. Make money. Speaking of which, why not expand the store? What for? We sell near everything people need. So we'll invent new needs. I could use a corner to open a hair salon. Just for ladies. What about Meo? He's on the way out. Some won't make it. Two salons won't be enough. Take your beer... You should charge more. Never, I won't raise prices one cent. Have it your way, Toussaint. But in the meantime I'm increasing the price of my cloth. Price of a beer's still the same. So what if it goes up? You don't pay for it. How do you know I don't? Nobody's been paid. So you do like everyone, put it on your tab. He's coming. Coast's clear. Thank you. Lately, Mr. Riopel, we've found minor flaws in your rails. Flaws? The quality has gone down. I'll look into it. It won't happen again. Another thing... I received the government's latest plans and... And? Well, the train... won't go to Saint-Elie. What? - It's not up to me. - Yeah, but... didn't we build the fork? Where will the railway go? They decided it's going to Charette. The men agreed to work for slave wages to get the station. - I can't help you, Mr. Riopel. - What? They'll starve to death. Just put me down and go finish the contract, or they'll lose the few dollars they're owed. That's how it is, Mr. Riopel. That's... That's business. They're still not sure if the train will stop here or in Charette. What will you do about the flaws? That's your concern now. Starting today, I'm making you under-boss. Under-boss? You'll have to put in a few more hours a week, but... think of the prestige. So go on, iron out them flaws. I think I have an idea. Lorenzo, Hubert, Will... your drinking on the job is hurting production. Who are you to tell us that? I'm the under-boss, bud. With all the overtime I do, I'm not hurting production. - You're not profitable. - What do you mean? - We're not paid! - The client complained. Oafs like you aren't going to make us lose the train. Wait a second, we work like slaves. You three, you're out. Nice do! Marie's not better? She's grown two bumps on her back. Feed her! I told you to buy food from Toussaint. I went there. - And? - Two days later it was all gone. Forget it. I'll go buy us some lunch. How will you pay for it? I'll put it on our tab. We could never afford credit. We won't start now. I'll do like everybody and pay later. Times have changed, Mom. Then you can make the meals. I'm not cooking with flour that charges interest. My sister's sprouting feathers. What's it mean? Never seen that before. She's stopped talking. She's pale. Marie is an old soul. She has a big heart. That makes it more vulnerable. What's going to happen? I can't say. Take good care of her. Grand Opening: Charette Station I'm disappointed too, but that's business. They're buying our rails. Could be worse. Worse? Half-wages for a station we won't see. At least the money keeps coming in. Darn sight better than a withered garden. Money? What about the money? When will you pay us? When will you hand out those envelopes? Everyone will get paid. I don't have it all because I had to invest some of it. Still... Let 'em dream on and save the little money they'll earn. Who'll tell them? No need to tell the villagers yet. They have enough worries. I thought you were stronger. You're the strongest. I'm sorry, my girl. Does Esimesac know? Will, 100' of rope. Hubert, a pair of boots. Mrs. Gelinas, a sack of flour... Well, dear? Still no sign of our station. What's that? The shadow of a doubt. I hear Toussaint's thinking of opening a barberette shop. He couldn't cut hair if his wife depended on it. I think it is his wife. A barber shop, for women. That may cost you a few customers. Yeah, but I'm no dummy. Mr. General Store wants to open a barber shop? I'll take a page from his book. I'll open a store on my veranda. - Can you afford it? - Sure! With all the new customers, I'll have plenty of money. But everybody buys on credit. The village doesn't need another garage. I barely scrape by. All them passengers will have lots of cars. They come by train, not car. I'll hold checkers matches in my garage. - Checkers? - Yes, Sir. And I'll charge people admission. That way, if the game's dull, I can reimburse their tickets. Open a store? Just 'cause my wife... Can we talk? Anna! I'm not interested. Strength in numbers, you said... The common good... You let me dream, Esimesac Gelinas. I look at you and all I see is your shadow. I didn't know. Well, now you do. Expanding your store to open a barber shop! After all I sold you on credit! Folks! Your wife gets her hair cut before it grows. It's called hair styling! Please! I say... I have to tell you... I have to tell you... The train's not coming to Saint-Elie. What? The train's never coming here. You can think what you like. I swear I did all I could. I believed in it I've been honest. And the rails? What'll we do with 'em? The train will pass through Saint-Paulin, Charette, and Saint-Boniface. The bastards. It'll stop everywhere but here? And our wages? That's all I know. For the rest, the smithy can answer your questions. People will starve to death or freeze. Don't worry, Father. It's not our first winter. We've survived legends worse than this. They've lost their faith. Their backs are bowed, hope has gone from their eyes. I don't think bowing down is the answer. We need to organize the Christmas Mass, like we always do. With joy and good humor. We may not eat our fill, but we'll dance. We'll dance all night. That'll give them the swing to make it 'til spring. Get through winter, just get through winter. Get through. You're blocking the sky. You should go inside. I want to watch the sky. The sky's empty. There's snow. Birds. Little Marie, with her waxen pallor... Famine was eating her up. For Esimesac, the only hope for saving people was to stop the train in it's tracks... The engine, the iron... Railroad the rail road. What are you doing? Stopping the train. It's full Of food. Who are you pulling for? It won't budge. Your pay's in the safe, in an envelope with your name. That's not why I came. You don't want your money? There's nothing to buy. I'm hungry, but you can't eat money. I need your help, Arsene. Help from me? You have to sing "O Holy Night" at midnight mass. I can't. Nobody wants me there. Now's not the time for self-pity. The village needs you. Are you a strongman? Act like a strongman. Stand up and sing. I hope there'll be food for Christmas eve dinner. I'm glad you hung it. Anything can happen. Christmas eve is magical. Apples of your eye... Jelly and pie... Sacks of flowers and oats... Horse slippers... I'm stuck with it. My reputation trails me everywhere. A shadow so big I trip on it. Can you rid me of it? It's too firmly attached now. You have to find the way. How? Light doesn't shine through me. It's not light that's the problem. You are. My little sister... Marie is dying, Esimesac. Because, verily, we are all brethren. And, I want to say that even in these hard times, I am happy and proud to be in this village and live amongst you. Midnight, Christians, it is the solemn hour. When God as man descended unto us. To erase the stain of original sin. And to end the wrath of his Father.
