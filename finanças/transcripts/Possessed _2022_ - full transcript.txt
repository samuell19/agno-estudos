This day of age, still having blackout. And there's no Wi-Fi either. Who's there? Who's there? Hey, this isn't funny! Help! Help! Get ready. One, two, three! Is it deep? -Hey it's just sand,... ...there are no rocks. -Is it cold? Cold, cold, cold. You're so timid, can you be braver next time? Moron! Come here. Okay, okay, okay. Afraid, huh? Afraid! Hey, sorry, sorry! Hey! My god, are you blind? It's your fault, why did you leave things right in the middle? Luckily I didn't kick it to that side. Oh, is it my fault now? Clean it up right now. You're so stern. Why would anyone want to get engage to you? Take this. -Okay, okay, okay. Look at that cousin of yours. She thinks I am bad at repairing cars. I am good at it! Sir, the GPS is out of coverage. Do I go straight on? Yes, just go along the road. Yes, sir. Where exactly is this college? And aren't the students on their semester break? Do you teach there? Yes. Adli, mum called. Adli! Boboi! Hey, don't you have another name to call? That's the name of my cat back at home. Oh, when you're here you don't want to answer mum's call. When you're home you cling to mum all the time. Alia, why did you call me Boboi? I called your name but you didn't respond. Mum called. I'll return her call later. What's there to call? There's no coverage at the hostel. Alia, there's Wi-Fi at the hostel. Gang! Let's pray before we head back. I'll pray later at the hostel. Liar! Assalamualaikum, mum. Yes, Adli's here. He's bathing at the river. I just thought of bringing him and his friends to play by the river. Don't worry, mum. I'll look after him. Kak Fiza is here too. Okay, mum. Bye! I'm not ready. Please don't take pictures yet. They wouldn't turn out good! You don't have to get ready, you already look good. Okay no, one more time! -Okay, one more! One! Two! Three! Look! Isn't it nice? Yes, it's nice. Kak Yam, what are you doing here? Delivering food supplies! Otherwise, what do the kids who didn't go home have to eat? They're all grown up, Kak Yam, they can take care of themselves. Hey, Farid! Did you hear? Hear what? -About the village right behind. Last week there was a fuss, some villagers got possessed. The Silat boys got possessed! There were seven of them as well. There Silat guys always go overboard. They were too engrossed. -Hey, I'm serious here! Their eyes turned all black. Their sclera disappeared. Their faces turned pale! They were probably on drugs. -No! Enough. I have to deliver food... ...to the canteen. -Okay, kak. Oh Allah oh my God, please forgive our sins. The sins of our parents, the sins of our teachers. Protect us from calamities, I beg You oh Allah. Please extend the lives of our parents. Please extend the lives of our teachers. Forgive our sins and distance us from adultery. And all kinds of sins, whether little or great. Ya Allah. Hurry up! Adli, the smoke has to go further that way! Be patient! If you want it fast cook it yourself. No, no, the problem right now is... ...I asked you guys to pray but you guys lied! That's right! -This is lying. Hey, is the chicken enough? Looking at your face,... ...I don't think it's enough Sam. -Done. Wow! -Eating alone, huh? Kak Fiza waited until she fell asleep. And you do like this to me, Sam. They were the ones who were late! I cooked myself. Here, it's all done for you. Sorry, sorry, sorry. You too, Adli. Why you didn't learn to cook properly? Sorry, Kak Fiza. -Now you're scared! Hey, where's Wari? -Wari..... I saw him over there just now. Wari! Are you done? -Yes. Tomorrow morning I'll arrive at five o'clock. Don't you forget to wake up. -Don't worry, I'm a professional. Ustaz? -Kak Yam. Is Warden Harris around? -Yes, ustaz. Probably in the office. What happened to his hand? -He got into an accident! He's still on leave isn't he? All right. I'll make my move. -Stay safe, kak. Come in. Nazmi! Have a seat. Sorry. I had to ask you come work early today. It's all right. There's nothing left for me at home. Don't say such a thing, Nazmi. Allah is testing you because He loves you. There must be a reason behind it. Right. A reason which... ...I couldn't find. How's your arm? It looks bad. -Not. Broken. Here. This is the list of students who will stay here tonight. Only 27 of them? This is what I managed to get. Hey! Sorry again because if it wasn't for the emergency... ...back in my hometown, I wouldn't have called. No worries. I really wanted to work. This is the key to the warden's room. You can stay there first. I don't have many things in there. Just my clothes. -Okay. One more thing. For tonight's maghrib prayers you'll be the imam. Ask someone else to do it. -Hey. Hey, hurry up! I want to go home. Let's go, let's go. -Quick! Quit messing around I want to go home. Now, okay! Okay, boss. Now the gate is closed. We're done for. Relax, Sam. It's just a gate. Then how are you guys going in? How about this? We'll go back to the main road. Drive us to the back. This is too much. Stop, kak. Here? -Yes, here. Hey, let's go. Let's go? Where to? Sam, you're such a nerd. I asked you to hang out but you didn't want to. Let's go. Are you guys heading back to Kuala Lumpur right away? No, we're going back the day after tomorrow. Kak Fiza has to meet the caterer tomorrow. Do you have some money, Alia? Now he's asking for money. Where's your own money? Kak, I've finished my money from PTPTN. Did you spend it or did you waste it? Of course I spent it, what else could it be? Here. -Thanks, Alia. Oh dear. Your brother is such a spoiled kid. Why are you being jealous? When you guys are back in Kuala Lumpur,... ...send my regards to mum, dad, uncle, aunt and the rest. Insya-Allah. -Take care of yourself. Take care, kak. Bye. -Bye, Boboi. Wari, what about the photos we took earlier? I'll email them later. -Send only the nice ones okay? I don't want those which aren't nice. Any photo with you in it is nice. Go now, otherwise they would leave you behind. Bye, Alia. Bye, kak. -Bye. All right all right, let's go. I like Wari. He's a sweet guy. Hey..... What? You like my sister, don't you? What are you talking about? -Don't lie to me. Even if I do like her, what's your problem? Big problem. You would be my brother-in-law. Crap. Just open up. Adli, help carry my bag. Okay, we'll go past the teachers' office. Wait. Why don't we just walk along the new block? You're so dense. Aren't we on semester break now? The teachers have gone home. Hey, hurry up! Wari. Wari. Wari. Hey! Are you okay? -Okay. Let's go. Hey, hold on. Okay, let's go. -It's nothing! Just a prank. -How dare you prank me. You making fun of me! -One, two, three, run! Why are you guys leaving me behind? Gang! Whoever's the last he's a monkey! Sam is a monkey! -Why me? So who's the monkey? -Sam. He already looks like one. Where did you guys come from? -We came from..... We came from the surau, ustaz. We're just done with our prayers. Yes that's true, we came from the surau. The student who was the imam took attendance just now. Your names weren't on it. Maybe because there were too many of us. He didn't notice us. -Many students. There's only seven people praying at the surau. Whose is this? It's not ours, ustaz. Maybe it belongs to other students. What other students? They've all gone home. You guys are the only ones here. I don't know, ustaz. All I know is I don't smoke. Neither do I. Follow me. See I told you guys. You guys are stubborn. What's your problem? -Playing the blame game now? You just want to get away with it yourself. Chill, I got punished as well, did I not? Hey gang! Isn't Ustaz Nazmi on a long break? Why is he here working? I saw his arm. Did you notice there was no cast on it? Did he get into some accident? Forget about him. Why bother minding other people's business? Let's do our job. Come on. Wari. Are you okay? Okay? I thought you had a fever. Clean this up, you guys. You think I'm paying you guys for nothing? Listen here. I left a gift for you guys in the toilet. The flush didn't work. What are you waiting for? Go pick it up. I ain't picking it up. You. Don't play with it, okay? Why are you guys laughing? As if you have never played with it. What kind of thing do you use? This one. I'm done. There's no Internet. Blackout. How am I going to update my Vlog? -Wait. What? -Oh no! My phone is running out of battery. Same here, my phone is dying out too. I don't have coverage either. How am I supposed to call my mum now? Serves you right for not listening to Alia. Good for you. You really go well with your name Boboi. You..... Hey, Ustaz isn't around, is he? Shall we leave? Don't do that. If ustaz found out, we would be done for. It's better we finish this. Just a bit more. Come on. -You're playing rough, huh? Wari. Hey! Wari, are you okay? Do you want some medicine? I'm not feeling well. Hey let's bring him to the dorm, let him have some rest. Let's go. Get in. Oh my! It feels so hot. Why is he so feverish? It's really hot. -Hot. I don't know what to do now. Okay, never mind. I'll go get some medicine from ustaz. You guys take care of him. -Okay. Get some rest, Wari. Hurry up, Adli. What's wrong with you, Wari? You became so sick. No idea. Could it be food poisoning? It couldn't be. Didn't we all eat the same thing just now? Ustaz! You freak me out. What's the matter? Was there a notice about power outage? No there wasn't. Probably a blown fuse because of the lightning. Even if we were to call the technician,... ...they would only come tomorrow. I personally don't mind. But I'm worried... ...that students might escape during the blackout. Don't worry. I'll help keep an eye later. Hey! -Ustaz. Didn't I ask you to clean the washroom? No, I'm looking for you. Wari has a fever. I'm here for some medicine. Stop lying. I swear, Wari is sick. I'm not lying. Where's he? -At the dorm. Wari. Astaghfirullahalazim. What happened? Wari. Wari. Wari! Wari! Nik. Nik! Nik! Hey! Nik! Nik. Place him over there. Tell me what happened. Actually, when we were cleaning the washroom earlier,... ...Wari suddenly had a fever. We brought him back to the dorm. When we reached the dorm, we noticed he looked weird. His eyes, his face..... I don't know how to put it, ustaz. What did your friend do that he became like this? I don't know ustaz. -No idea. Whose phone has got coverage? I have a phone, ustaz. But there's no coverage here. If we want coverage, we have to go to the new block. We can only get one bar there. We need to go there. -Ustaz. What about Wari? You are all my responsibility. Let's deal with the phone first. Look after him. Why do we have to stay here? Otherwise who would look after Nik? -What if Wari comes? Otherwise what are you going to do? Are you telling ustaz to handle all this? This dorm right here? Go get coverage. Once you've made a call... ...head back to the warden's room. -Okay ustaz. The students are still awake. What's going on? Why are you still awake? Hey! What are you doing here? What's wrong with you? Are you okay? Ustaz! Help, ustaz! Ustaz! -What are you doing?! I want to let him in. -You moron! It could be Wari! You're the moron. Wari doesn't sound like that. What if he was pretending, Kechik? Don't dig your own grave! What then? Are we just going to leave him out there? Ustaz help! Now that food has been dealt with, I only have one problem left. Flowers. Do you want roses or lilies, Alia? Alia. Hello, Alia. What's wrong? I have a bad feeling. Adli? Alia. Alia. Alia you've to get back here, now! Hello, Adli. -Alia. Alia we're in danger Alia. You need to get back here, please. Hello. I can't hear clearly. Alia listen here. Wari is sick. Get back here, right now! Adli, what are you talking about? Alia. Alia please. We're in danger, you have to come. Danger? What sort of danger? Hello? Alia. Alia! Adli. Hello? Wari. Wari. I couldn't get through. Kak Fiza, I feel that something's wrong. What exactly is wrong? Because Adli said Wari fell sick. He was just talking nonsense. But that's what Adli said. Okay, so? What? You believe Adli just like that? He was just pulling your leg. No. I know Adli. I know when he lies or serious. Kak Fiza, I think Adli is in danger. We need to double back right now. Adli. Hey! Astaghfirullahalazim. Are you okay? Wari..... -Kechik. Wari changed. I saw his face. I don't know how to describe this. I stabbed him. Is he dead? I'm not sure. Where's Ustaz Nazmi? He isn't back yet? -No. We split up earlier. He went to look around... ...at the seniors' block. Nik. Where are we? What happened? Are you okay? -I don't know. My head is pounding like a drum. I feel dizzy. We've to get Nik to the hospital. Where's Wari? Adli, were you able to call the ambulance just now? No, my handphone broke. Then who's coming to save us? But I was able to call Alia. Let's wait here. Maybe she'll arrive in a while. Ustaz. Ustaz..... -What happened? I was attacked by a student. His face..... He is dead, ustaz. His face..... Kak Yam..... Kak Yam told me there was a possession in the nearby village. Possession? -Possession. What do we do Ustaz? There are students in my room. Let's meet up with them. And we'll make a plan. I thought of the students who went hysterical... ...must have spread it in some way. How does it spread then? I don't know. But I don't think it spreads through air or infection. Because we wrestled with Wari earlier but nothing happened. Wari bit you just now, didn't he? How could it spread through biting? Sir! Sir! Where is the guard? Why is the dorm pitch black? I was right. Adli must have called because something went wrong. Kak Fiza, we must get inside. Okay let's go. Wait. Does she have the key? How is your sister going to enter once she's here? You're right. It isn't that difficult. Just open it. Where's the key? Usually the guard puts it in the booth. I think we've to open the gate now. But, isn't it dangerous out there? It's okay, Sam, I can go alone. Never mind, I will follow you. Nik, look after Sam. Let's go. Give me your phone. There's not much battery left, is it fine? All right, let's go. Look, there are lights! Do you think it's Farid or..... It's okay, Kechik. We'll go have a look. -Let's go. Chik, Chik! Wait. Did you see them? -No. Hey are you okay? Kechik, I think I can't go back with you guys. What are you talking about? We're going back to the warden's room now and we'll treat you. You know what will happen to me, right? Adli, come in. Come in! Okay. Once my sister arrives,... ...you bring Nik to the hospital. What about you? Hey, hey! Adli! Adli! -Close the door! Did you ask for anyone's help? Earlier I asked the students to call for help. How long does the power outage last usually? I don't know. There must be something that we can do. This place used to be powered by generator. We still have it, but I don't know if it is still usable. We have to try activating the generator. How? I don't know how. I'm not good at it. Kak Fiza! Blood. Kak Fiza, look. There's someone over there. Hey kid. We're looking for a student here. His name is Adli, do you know him? Who's that, Kak Fiza? Kak Fiza! -Alia! Alia! Alia! Run Alia! Go! Alia! Alia! Get up! Get up! Alia! Alia! Run! Run, Alia! Run! Run! Alia! Alia! -Hey! Hey! Hey! Ustaz! Ustaz, ustaz! Let's go, ustaz! My bag! My bag! My bag! What are you doing? -Run! Alia! Hey! Who are you people? I am the sister of a student here, Adli. He called for help just now. Do you know him? Yes. He is already at the warden's room. Wait! Wait! What's wrong with the student just now? Why? -We have no idea either. But right now we've to go back to the warden's room. Let's go. -Hey, hurry up! Faster! Faster! Where's Kechik? He couldn't have left me behind, could he? Relax, Sam. My mind became a mess just from looking at you. Kak Fiza! Alia! -Sam? Where's Adli? Adli and Kechik went to open the gate near you guys. Didn't you run into them? -Hey, the gate key is with me. Who's that? Alia! Kak Fiza! -Kechik! Where's Adli? I asked where's Adli? Tell us. Tell us what happen. Adli became just like Wari. No! Adli! Alia. Alia. Look at Kak Fiza. Didn't I tell you and Adli not to leave the room? You guys insisted. Look what happened to Adli. You moron! -Can you just shut up? Shut up? What I said was true. If Adli was careful... ...it wouldn't turn out this way. -You're wrong! Adli is our friend. Please be considerate of their feelings! You saw earlier, a student asking for help. Why didn't you help them? I had to ensure Nik's safety. Was it his safety or your safety that you wanted to ensure? Cut it out! Kak Fiza, where did you park? I parked at the place where I dropped you guys earlier. Can we all fit in your van? The key is in the bag. -Bag? We've to get it from the student at the football field. Does anyone have a phone? There's no coverage. -There's no coverage at this area. What's more there's a blackout, so there's no internet either. We've to go to a higher place. What do we do now? We need to learn about the things out there. They're savage, ustaz. I saw it with my own eyes. When they were gathering at the field. I think Wari is their leader. They can seemingly communicate with each other. One more thing, their eyes. They can't look at light. Are you sure about the generator? -I'm sure! But I don't know if it is still usable. Wait. There's a generator? Show it to me. Perhaps I can fix it. Do we have toolbox and petrol? -Yes, we do. At the workshop. -Let's go! Wait. Let's split up. Farid, bring Fiza to the generator. Sam, you and Kechik head to the workshop. Look for some petrol, take the toolbox... ...and meet up with them at the generator. Wait. Wouldn't it be dangerous to split up? I think it would be easier for them to spot us... ...if we move in a big group. -Okay. Handphone. -What do you want to do? I've to go get coverage at the upper floor. I want to tag along. I can help. No way. You have to stay here. But this is my phone. I want to tag along. Nik, as long as it isn't done, don't go out, you got it? Wari. I am sorry, Wari. I am sorry. I'm so glad you are still alive, Wari. Don't worry, Adli, I'm fine. But I am in pain, Wari. I'll bring you to a world without suffering. Close your eyes, Adli. Trust me. Follow me, Adli. Hurry, we're almost there. There, the generator's place. Let's go. Here! Come on! Come on! Go! Go! It's stuck! It's stuck! You! How is it going? Can you fix it? I can try. I learnt about this model back then. Anyway we have to wait for Kechik. All right. You! Here. -What's this? I want to go out and wait for Kechik. Whatever happens, don't go out. Sam! Take this. Sam! Sam! Let's go! Nik! Open the door, Nik! Nik! Sam! What's the matter? Where's Kechik? Kechik died. Are you serious? Don't joke around with me. It's true, Nik. I saw it with my own eyes. He was trapped at the workshop. I think that right now... ...we need to go to the secret door. We've to get Kak Fiza's van. Didn't they lose their keys at the field? What do we do now? We need to leave this place. We need to go to the highway. We've to get to the main road. We must get help, Nik. What about Ustaz Nazmi, Alia, Kak Fiza? We left them here? -We must get out of here Nik. Otherwise we would all die here! Please, let's get out, Nik. Let's escape from here, Nik. Adli Adli. Hey! Are you all right? Adli..... Ustaz! Adli! Adli don't! Adli, don't! Adli! Adli, Alia's here. Adli! Alia! Alia! Alia! Please take care of dad and mum, promise me, Alia. I promise, I promise. But you've to keep fighting, Adli. Please keep fighting. Adli! We must go now. Alia! We must go now! Let's go! Over here! Okay, our secret door is there. What's now? What do we do? I will count to three,... ...we run together and don't ever stop. Okay. -Okay. One, two, three! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Help me Sam! Sam! Get lost! Get lost! Ustaz! Adli! Kechik! Kechik! Run, Kechik! Faster! -Kechik! Faster! Faster, Kechik! Get in, Kechik! Kak Fiza! Harder, Kak Fiza! Harder! Harder! Let's go! This way. Hold this. Ustaz! Get in! Get in! Help me! Kak Fiza, how can I help? -Do you know... ...how a crank handle look like? -Yes, I know. Okay, please find it. Thank you. What else should we do, ustaz? We've to wait for the generator. Can we make it, ustaz? What if we can't make it? I hope we can make it till dawn. Nazmi. Who are you? -It's me, Wari. I'm here to help you. Follow me, Nazmi. Follow me. You won't feel any pain. Your suffering will end, follow me, Nazmi. My pain. My life. What do you know about them? I know about your children. About your wife. Isn't this world unfair? What sins have you committed? Why did he do this to you? Follow me, Nazmi. Ustaz. What happened to your family? Dear, what do we do now? You told me that you would be coming back. I thought of giving you a surprise. Surprise? What surprise? -What surprise did you want? Dad! Let's go to the zoo shall we? -We are going to the movies. I want to bring you all to the funfair! I know it will be fun... ...but won't you feel tired? It's not like I'm doing this all the time. Every day I ask God. Why? Why it wasn't I who died that day? Honey! Honey! Honey! Sarah! Forgive me, forgive me. My dear. I am okay. Don't worry. Our kids are waiting for us. Follow me, Nazmi. My dear, don't worry. Follow me, Nazmi. Our kids are waiting for us, my dear. Follow me, Nazmi. My dear. The kids are waiting for you. Follow me, Nazmi. Ustaz. You can go. But we need leave this place together, ustaz. Soon I...... I will be like them. Remember your promise to Adli. Thank you. Please. I'm trying. Why is he acting this way? Wait. I don't know why. Wait, wait. Follow me, Nazmi. A fire that took place at a hostel... ...has killed more than 20 people. The police is still investigating the cause of the incident. The public is advised not to spread any false information... ...and false news on social media. Three victims were saved while another victim is suffering... ...from serious injuries and is now being treated at the hospital. Nonetheless their identities have yet to be confirmed.
