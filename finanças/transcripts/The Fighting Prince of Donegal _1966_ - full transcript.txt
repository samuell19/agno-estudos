[Triumphant music] * [upbeat orchestral music] * [Soothing string music] * - Any news yet? [Birds chirping] - Mother! [Birds chirping] - Listen to them cryin'. It's part of the legend. "The birds will gather in their hundreds "when Hugh succeeds Hugh as prince of donegal and Ireland shall be free." [Dog barking] [Birds chirping] [Dog barking] [Dog barking] - My husband is dead. - All: God rest his soul. - My son is the O'Donnell now. Hugh has succeeded Hugh. - The hour has struck, lady ineen. Do we strike too? - Do we fight for Ireland? [Men arguing loudly] - No. We o'donnells can do nothing by ourselves. No single clan is strong enough. Only if all the clans unite-- the mcsweeneys, the maguires, the o'neills, o'Connors-- everyone of US-- can we stand up to the English. - And fight? - No! Bargain from strength. - Bargain? For what? - To be left alone and free! Not occupied by English troops! To protect our coastline with our own men. - I say face the English with an army! Fight them before they occupy US! Show them! - How will that help Ireland? By laying waste our lands? - The legend, Hugh, the legend that Ireland shall be free! - If I can make all the clans unite... With an army behind me, the English will listen. They want no war with US, nor we with them. - I say fight! - Fight them! - Fight! Fight! Fight! [Men shouting] - I say no. We will fight only if they will not make a treaty. If they fight US-- all of US, every clan united. Until then, go home... And wait for the word. I'll go to the clan mcsweeney first. I'll start at dawn. - But travel alone, Hugh. The English have spies and informers everywhere. I'll spread the word that you're visiting mcsweeney to see Kathleen. Perhaps the thought is father to the wish. And remember, Hugh... You've inherited more than a crown. This is the moment all Ireland has waited for. [Bagpipes playing] [Crowds celebrating] - Hugh! That is a young O'Donnell! - The O'Donnell himself, mcsweeney. My father is dead. - No. No. That terrible fighting man. God rest his soul. - So you know why I'm here. - Yes. I know. Come, lad. Silence! Silence, all of you! [Castle quiets] You know who this is. You knew him here as a boy. Now know him as the prince of donegal! The old prince is dead. [People moaning] Wait! The prophecy has come true! Hugh has succeeded Hugh! [People cheering] - Hugh. - Kathleen. - Hugh, your father. I am sorry. - Oh, it had to be. It's been such a long time. - I'm sorry, O'Donnell. - What are you doing here, Henry O'Neill, anyway? I thought you were wooing one of the o'Connor beauties these days. - Ah, so I was. However, I failed there and my heart is broken. - Again? - But it's mending fast. And with Kathleen's help-- - no, find yourself a place at another table, Henry lad. Hugh sits with me tonight. [Laughter] Quiet! All of you! Close your mouths. Open your ears and listen. You all know the legend so you know why the O'Donnell's here. The time has come for all of US to fight! [People cheering] - [Banging on table] Quiet! Quiet! Fight... For the o'donnells? - For all of US! For Ireland! [People cheering] - Quiet! Quiet! - Under the orders of an O'Donnell because of an old wives' tale? [Laughter] - For a belief! For a belief. A faith. A necessity. You mcsweeneys, the maguires, the o'Connors, even the o'neills. [Laughter] Then all the rest. - If the English march north, we o'neills can defend ourselves. [Cheers] Are you all dreaming? Legend against the English guns? - Wait! Give me your daggers. - Go on, lad. - Some of you think each clan by itself can stop the English coming north to occupy US. Each clan strike a single blow like this! - Ah! - Hey! - What good will that do? But like this, and like this, and this, and this! [Cheers] But one direction, with all of US together, we can stay free! - Now do you see? - Dub thee O'Neill. [Laughter] - All right, O'Donnell, you want to rally Ireland, show your strength and try a brawl with an O'Neill! [Cheers] - The pipes! - Father. - Yeah, girl, don't spoil the fight. [Bagpipes play] [People shouting] * - There you go! Henry! [Laughter] - All right, O'Donnell, I'm with you. [Cheers] - Oh, father! - "Father, father." Faith, girl. The liquor has no more effect on me than water on a dam. [Laughter] Every mcsweeney who's for the O'Donnell, drink with me. O'Donnell! - All: O'Donnell! - And I'll drink to you. To our alliance. To every man who's not afraid to die for freedom. To die for Ireland. - All: Ireland. - [Whispers] Ireland. - O'Donnell! - All: O'Donnell! [People cheering] - Oh, isn't she beautiful? - Yes, she is. I've thought about you. Often. - Are there no girls in donegal? You stayed away so long. - And remembered every minute of the times I've spent here with you. I thought about you. The way you look. The way you smile. The way your eyes shine. Did you ever think of me? - Sometimes. Yes. I wondered if you'd be changed when I saw you again. You are changed. Your speech tonight when you threw those daggers, you were as I'd never seen you before. - I saw myself then and I saw more than that. I saw what a hard task I have before me. - You broke its back tonight. - No, no, no. Only partly. It'll be the same everywhere with all the other clans. We Irish just aren't used to alliances. But I know it's the only way for US to win. I know it. I've got to make them believe I'm right. Do you believe I'm right? - I hope you're right, Hugh. - You're so lovely. Do you know, when you first came in, my heart turned over? - Oh, no. - Yes. I've missed you. I didn't realize how much. Kathleen... Wouldn't you know it. - We're dancing, Kathleen. Will you come? - Yes. We will. - Stay here and keep an eye on that English merchantman out there. It needs watching. - It will be best, I think, if we start for Tyrone and the o'neills' country tonight before the moon's up. There's eyes spying for the English even here. And after last night, plenty of tongues to wag. - Must you go so soon? - Yes, we must. There's no time to lose. - Mm. - [Grunts roughly] - An officer from the ship in the bay, my lord. - Oh, good day to you and welcome. - James Powell, your honor. First mate aboard the merchantman excelsior. We're trading along the coast with goods. You may care to sample if it pleases you. - What kind of goods, master Powell? - Well, we have blades from Toledo. We have silks, woolens, wine, and Brandy. All of the very best. This is just a sample of what we have. If you'll allow me. - Allow you. Uh, by all means, master Powell. - This silk is beautiful. - Toledo steel? - Uh, your good health. Oh, nectar it is. Here. Try some of this, Hugh. - My captain sent me to tell you he would be glad to have you dine aboard this evening. There you can decide which wine you like best. - Um... - You too, my lord. We have other swords for you to see. - Can I come along too? - Uh, your ladyship, a vessel is a man's world as they say. By if you tell their honors, I'm sure-- - this is a wine to warm a man's heart. - Then try the Brandy, my lord. - Oh, that I will. - You'll dine aboard with US tonight. It will be our pleasure. - Oh, sure. If it's all as good as this... - I'm afraid, sir, tonight, we won't be able-- - of course we will. Tell your captain we'll be glad to come. At what hour? - At sunset. I'll have a longboat at the shore. - At sunset, we'll be there. - It will be our pleasure. Believe me. I'll leave these goods with you. Your servant. - Until sunset, master Powell. - Why did you tell him we'll go? You know we can't. - What's a few hours? It's not often we get a chance to taste a wine like this and free hospitality from these English rogues. - We have to leave tonight. - Now don't you worry, lad. We'll only stay aboard an hour or so. Sure it'll warm US for the journey. - Then you go. I'll stay here. - Someone will have to go with him, see him safely back, [whispers] Else he'll not leave for Tyrone tonight. Someone. - I wasn't invited. You go. I'll take care of things here. - Hugh, please. Go. - All right. - Oh, it--oh, that's... [Knock at door] - The lord mcsweeney, captain, and a guest, master Hugh. - Welcome aboard. - Fine snug quarters you have here, captain. - Like you to give an opinion on our cargo as well, your honor. - Oh, that I will, captain, with the greatest of pleasure. Your good health, captain. [Knock at door] - One moment. My other officers, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Rush. Help yourselves, gentlemen. I would like to propose a toast. - Oh, as many as you wish. - This is a wine from Bordeaux. A little young for some tastes. - Yes, yes, but very good, I'm sure. - A little rough as yet. But it'll improve with keeping. Bouquet is there. I think you'll agree. - I care little about these refinements, captain. All I know about wine is if I like the taste of it. So let's have your toast and drink up, eh? - Gentlemen, I give you the health of all those loyal to the queen of england. And death to every rebel in Ireland. - Sir! - Now! [Gunshot] - [Grunting] You treacherous dogs, what trick is this? - That's simple enough. My orders are to take the O'Donnell into custody. You served your purpose and I thank you. Put the mcsweeney ashore. - Take your hands off me! Take your hands! Take your hands off me! - Stay where you are, my prince of donegal. You're to be a guest of the queen. Mr. Powell, make ready to sail. - Sir. - I don't see why, your excellency, we don't march north and occupy it. Keep these Irish clans separate by force. - No. We shall achieve that by peaceful means, captain Leeds. Those are my orders. [Rings bell] Bring in the prisoner. Master O'Donnell, welcome to Dublin castle. I have the honor to be your host. Allow me to introduce myself. I am her majesty's servant, viceroy of Ireland. This is captain Leeds, my Garrison commander. - And I am the prince of donegal and nobody's servant. - Wait outside. I must apologize for the manner in which you were brought here and for the necessity of keeping you here. The reasons have already been explained to you aboard ship, I believe. - Yes. And I hope my friends refuse to be intimidated by you. - You traitorous young-- - Leeds! Your friends in the north will be told, master O'Donnell, that the first sign of an armed alliance against my authority, you will hang. I'm sure they would not wish your death any more than I do. You will be kept here only so long as the present state of emergency with Spain exists. I promise you you'll be fairly treated if you will give me your word that you will not try to escape. - No, sir. I will not promise that. - No matter. Escape is impossible in any case. Captain Leeds here will make fairly sure of that. [Rings bell] We shall meet from time to time, I'm sure. Take the prince of donegal to his quarters. - Prince of donegal, indeed. I'd put him in a dungeon, the insolent young pup. - Just guard him well, captain. That's all you have to do. - Your excellency. - Face front! Now, who's it going to be today? You! And you. Right, fall out! [Prisoners cheering] - Enjoy your fresh air. - Who are these people? - Men from wicklow and cork. Fought the English when they came to occupy their towns. - And yourself? - I'm Sean O'Toole. You're red Hugh of donegal. I heard they brought you here. News travels fast in this place. [Prisoners cheering] [Prisoners quiet] - Well, well, well... The prince of donegal. Let's see how well you fight. [Kicks quarterstaff] - When I fight, captain, it will not be with a quarterstaff. - Pick it up. "Pick it up," I said. You, pick that up. Defend yourself, O'Donnell. [Prisoners cheering] Aha ha. That's better. Come on. [Kicks quarterstaff] - Pick it up. - Ah, you... [Groans] - [Grunts] - [Chuckling] Ah ah! [Prisoners cheering] Ah. - Give in or I'll break your arm. - Guards! Guards! Put him in irons. Confine him to his cell from now on. [Prisoners laughing] - Come on, my lord. [Laughter continues] [Thunder rumbles] [Scratching] [Scratching continues] [Thunder rumbles] [Scratching continues] [Scratching continues] - Hello. - How did you get these out? - I worked at it for weeks to talk to a friend in your cell. By the time I got through, they had him hanged. - What did you use? They won't let me even have a knife. - Keep your voice down. Part of the steel from my leg brace. - Do you mean you... Where does this chimney lead to? - The battlements. - If I'm caught with this, I'll involve you. - I'll chance that. [Door unlocks] - Good evening to you. Unlock the prisoner's shackles. Don't make your stay here more unpleasant than it need be, master O'Donnell. You have a head on your shoulders. Use it. The speeches of her majesty. I hope you've been improving your mind while you're here. You have two things in common with her, you know. - Yes? - Stubborn pride is one. No bad thing of itself. - And the other? - She was herself a political prisoner in the tower of London when she was not much younger than you are now. She has great sympathy for you. - She has a strange way of showing it. - She said to me at the time of ordering your arrest, "why must history always be written in blood? "It need not be. I would not wish this young man's death." - [Quickly] Couldn't the queen... Have made a treaty with US not to occupy the north rather than arrest me? - Actions do better than words in politics, master O'Donnell. - I'll remember that. - And remember too... I'm obliged to support my officers... Even when they act unwisely. It would be bad for discipline if one of them were to lose face. So you must remain in solitary confinement for one more week. [Knocks at door] Try to make the best of your time. - Oh, I will try. [Door unlocks] [Latch opens] [Latch locks] [Thunder rumbles] - [Shivers] [Laughter] [Thunder rumbles] [Metal bar resounds] - You can be grateful for the storm with the noise you're making. [Thunder rumbles] - I almost... [Bar rattling] Almost have it free. Yes. [Thunder rumbles] [Loud metallic bang] - What are you doing now? - If I can get another one of these free, you'll be able to crawl through. We can both get out by the chimney. - Don't be a fool. It took me weeks to loosen the blocks that are out now. Go on, Hugh, get away. Hugh, it's impossible. - [Exhales] [Metal bounces off floor] [Thunder rumbles] - When you're clear, head south for the wicklow mountains. My uncle O'Toole will help you. - Who'll help you? - You will. Raise your standard and fight for Ireland. That's the only way you'll get me free. Go now. - Right. - Hugh. Can you give me back my steel? I cannot walk without it. - Oh. [Laughs] Sorry. - Good luck. [Thunder rumbles] [Footsteps approaching] [Feet sliding] - Who's there? - [Mimics accent] I'm taking some ale to the guardhouse. - Ah. Tell 'em to save some for me. [Guards laughing] - Where's your dice then? I don't know where they've gone. It's your turn. - No, it's not. It's yours. - All right then. I'll play. [Laughter] [Cheering] - Hey. Hey. - What's that? - Come with me. - Go ahead. - Come on. - Hit it! [Wind blowing] [Wind blowing] [Bell ringing] [Gate slams shut] [Bell ringing] [Dogs barking] [Oars splashing] [Keg rumbles] - Here he is, boys. Red Hugh O'Donnell himself. We've been all day and night looking for you, lad. - Who are you? - Phelim O'Toole. - You knew I was in these parts? - There are eyes in every valley, boy, even if you didn't see them. And some of them spying for the English. You are none too far ahead of their patrols. - Will you help me to get back to donegal? - Heh. Ah, sure. Sure that I will. Come on. Look down there. - Look, they're on both sides of US! - They've seen US. Run for it! - No, it's too late. Give up! - Go! - Phelim O'Toole at your honor's service. Handing over an escaped prisoner. - You were heading south away from Dublin. - Toward glencree. I was gonna hand him over there. I hope there's a reward for him. - Your reward is that I don't call you a liar. I knew we should have kept you in irons, O'Donnell. After this, I promise you we will. Tie him up and put him on a horse. - I'll kill you first. - Take him! - You traitor! Oh! - Take him away. And you, O'Toole, get back to your castle and stay there. Be grateful I'm not taking you to Dublin too. - I am, captain. I am. Believe me, I'll not forget this. - [Sighs] - Hugh. - You too? - Found out how you got away. - You're lucky the viceroy didn't hang you for it. And he might still do that. [Laughs] [Door closes] - How far did you get? - To the edge of your country. I was with the O'Toole himself when I was trapped. Next time... - Next time? How can there be a next time from a place like this? - I don't know. But there will be. There must be. - I had to let them take him. So I rode north as fast as I could. The word I get from Dublin castle is that Hugh might be removed to London to the tower. - Unless that is a bluff. - The queen does not bluff. She's a politician, yes. But she's a realist. She'd hang her grandmother if she was a threat to the crown. - But if we asked her for a treaty, offer terms, bargain with them for my son's freedom while there's still time. - Swallow our pride and go cap in hand to Dublin like a crowd of beggars? - Yes. I'm prepared to do just that! The viceroy, they say, is a reasonable man for an englishman. And even if he rejects the treaty, Hugh could be no worse off than he is now even in their bloodstained tower. - Hugh might be, mcsweeney. He might arrest you too. - Well, I'll risk that. - I'll go with you. - Take me too. Please, father. - You, girl? Have you lost your senses? - Please. They might let me see him. Please. If they don't sign the treaty, I won't see him for years. Maybe never if they take him to the tower. - No. - Yes, mcsweeney. Hugh would want to see her. That I know. And with you and Henry there, what harm could come to her? Take her, mcsweeney. - Hmm? - Oh, fates, if we could get the men to band together like the women, Ireland's freedom would be easy. Oh. - If I may say so, captain, it's been the viceroy's policy to-- - I don't care about the viceroy's policy. He's not here and I am. [Knocking at door] Yes? - A deputation from the north in the anteroom, captain. The mcsweeney and the son of the O'Neill asking to see his excellency. - I will see them. Send them in. - Yes, sir. - I'm captain Leeds, deputizing for the viceroy. He is in London. - I am the mcsweeney. Henry, son of the O'Neill. My daughter, Kathleen. - And what do you want? - I'm here to speak for the northern clans, my own, the o'neills, o'Connors, and O'Donnell, to offer a treaty. - A treaty. Hmm. With you? - If you will forward the terms we proposed to his excellency. - I have the authority to act for him. What is this treaty, mcsweeney? - If we guarantee to defend our coast against invasion from Spain, place an agreed number of men-at-arms at the queen's disposal under her orders and officered by ourselves... - Wait a moment. - At no cost to the queen, whose representatives may inspect our positions at any time, if in return, she will Grant-- - give me that. Wait in the anteroom. I will study it. - Can we not discuss our-- - I said I will study it, mcsweeney. - Captain Leeds, may I ask a favor from you? - A favor? - Your permission to visit the prince of donegal. - That is not possible. - I beg you captain to make it possible. I beg you. Please. - I'm afraid not. - Please. - What harm can there be in the letting the young lady see him, captain? - If not for his sake, then for mine. - My orders are-- - come, sir, what harm? There's not a man in the castle who would not praise you for it. - Oh, very well. He may see you. For a few minutes only. But under guard. If you are present, you are respons... And the lady must be searched. - I'll agree to anything you say just so long as I can see him. - I said wait in the anteroom, mcsweeney. I will send for you when I need you. [Door rebounds off wall] - When they first told me you were here, I couldn't believe it. I still can't believe it. - Oh, Hugh. I thought, and prayed, and hoped they'd let you go. I've been frightened for you. - [Laughs] We have so little time. Not now. Don't talk about that now. Let me look at you. Touch you. I dreamed about this so often. - I too. I love you. - Truly? - Truly. I didn't know before when you... Well, laugh and-- and make fun. I didn't know it was possible to feel like this. - Oh, I love you too. I always have. Hold me. How did you come here? - With my father and Henry O'Neill. - Wait, what? - They came to bargain for you with the English. - And put their heads into a noose? - No, they brought a treaty. - The English won't bargain! - Don't even say it. They have to. Oh, Hugh, I couldn't go back without you now. I couldn't. - Whatever happens, promise to wait for me. I won't be in here forever. They can't keep me forever. They can't. And when I'm free, oh, Kathleen, when I'm free... Don't cry. Don't cry. - No. I won't cry. I won't. - I'm sorry. Time's up, O'Donnell. You must go back to your cell. - Don't let him see your tears. Remember everything. I will. - May I? - Yes, of course. Lady Kathleen. - The answer is no. - Without discussion? - You seriously think that in return for these promises of yours, the prince of donegal would be released? - In exchange for his freedom, we offer you an army. - Under your own command. And what guarantee that the hothead O'Donnell won't unite you all and fight US? - Our word, captain. - Your word. [Chuckles] Your word. I have been here long enough, mcsweeney, to know how much reliance to put on the word of you Irish. - When does the viceroy return so we may discuss this with a gentleman? - Which I am not? - Which clearly you are not. - Wait, boy. - Get out of here before I lose my temper. - As well as your manners? - Henry. - Go home, mcsweeney. Tell your friends the answer's no. - Not until we've been allowed-- - I said get out of h-- guard, arrest that man. - Captain Leeds! - Arrest him! - You can't do this! - Keep out of this, mcsweeney, or I'll take you too. - Next time we'll meet, I'll teach you a lesson in manners! - Henry, what happened? - Well, we came to bargain for your freedom. And the discussion led to hard words between the charming captain Leeds and myself. So I joined you here. - Joining me in a dungeon is hardly going to help to gain our freedom. - Well, two heads are better than one to plan an escape and three better than two. - You're lucky yours is still on your shoulders! Of all the irresponsible, stupid-- - but why? You didn't get very far trying to get away by yourself, did you? Now with me here to help you, they don't stand a chance. [Mouse squeaking] - Ha. [Mouse squeaking] - Caught him. Ha. Now don't worry. There. [Door unlocks and opens] Oh, you'd think they'd be glad to have a friend to join them, wouldn't you? - How can you tell when a mouse is glad? [Laughs] You ought to train them to run races. - Can't train mice. - Yes, you can. I have. When I was a boy on my father's farm, I used to catch them in the barn. I had six of them. I used to teach them all kinds of things. - What? - Well, to jump over sticks. And to come one by one to eat from my hand. - Where was this? - In england. - In england? Well, you sound Irish to me. - My mother was Irish. - This last one looks cleverer than the first two. I'm gonna call him O'Neill. - You're new, aren't you? What's your name? - Martin. The only way to train them is by rewarding them with bits of food. - What, the food here? That's no reward even to mice. - It's better than what we get, master. Be grateful for it. - Oh, we are. We are. But would the mice be? - [Laughs] - They'll probably get out of there. - Not without being helped, they won't. Makes me feel like a jailor. - I suppose that's a feeling you get used to, isn't it, Martin? - Your mother must be proud to have a son a jailor to Irish prisoners. - And sell his pride for a shilling or two. - Times are hard. - Uh, how much is a jailor's pay, Martin? - Little enough. Even less than a soldier's. - And he's as much a prisoner as the men he guards. - That's true. - What do you mean? - You're a prisoner. You'll still be here long after we've gone. Are you happy under the yolk, Martin? - Leave me alone. I have my duty to do. - What about your duty to yourself? What would you do if you had money to choose? - Fancies and daydreams aren't for the likes of me. - Why not? Any man can dream. What would you do? - Come on. Tell US. - Yes, tell US, Martin. Why not? - Well...I'd buy a farm. Like my father and his father before him. - Is your father still living? - No. He died of the plague years ago. - And your mother, where's she? - She's a servant in London. - In London. She must hate that. - She has to live. - But what kind of a life? Poor soul. - When did you last see her, Martin? - Two years ago. - If you had money enough to buy the farm, you'd have her with you, wouldn't you? - That I would. Ah, don't talk about it. - Martin. - What? - There's a way for you to escape your bondage and be a hero to all Ireland. - What way? - Help US. When I get my freedom, I'll give you yours and your farm. - You're asking me to risk my life. There are high stakes. No. No. - Something on account. - Come on, Martin, what are you doing? Hurry up, will you? - These... Are real? - Yes. And I have more. - If I was caught... I'll...I'll have to think it over. - Come on, Martin! Haven't got all day to wait for you. [Door locking] - I've arranged a place where--where you can change your clothes. And a horse is waiting outside the city walls. If we get that far. - Don't worry. We'll get that far. - When will my next payment be? - When we're clear and in the mountains. - No. No. I'm not going that far with you. - But you can't stay here. If we escape, they'll hang you. - I didn't mean to stay here. I'll move down the coast and get a ship. If I stayed with you, your countrymen would kill me. - Oh, it's not true, Martin. You've got to trust me as I trust you. [Footsteps approaching] - Look out. - Quick, the file! [Door unlocks] - Good evening. Forgive me for neglecting you for so long. Any complaints? - Wouldn't it be uncivil to criticize your hospitality, captain? - Stand on your feet when I come in, O'Donnell. - Uh, sorry. You make me too nervous, captain. - I've had a dispatch from england. You're to be removed from here and taken to the tower of London. - When? - The day after tomorrow. I'll be glad to see the back of you, O'Donnell. Open up! [Door locking] - Tower. Once they get me there, that's... That's--that's the end of everything. Martin. It's tomorrow night or not at all. - I don't know, master. But...I'll tr--I'll try. - He's not coming. I tell you, the little rat's not coming. - Yes, he is. - It's too late. He must've given US away. - I don't believe it. He'll come. He has to. [Door opens] - Here. Take these. You might need them. Hurry. Now come on. Follow me. - Away you go. [Water flowing] - This trap leads to the storm drain. [Water flowing] - Oh, it's cold! - O'Neill, shut up. - Sean. - After you. Go on. Quickly. - Tie the rope end to the cover and let yourself down! - I'm not going. - Sean, come on! - I'd only be a hindrance to you. Go without me. - I'll make you. - Go without me. Good luck. - Come on, masters, we're wasting time! - [Coughing] - This must be where it goes under the castle wall. - It's either drown or hang. I'll go first. - [Panting] No, I can't swim! I'd soon--I'd sooner handle a horse underwater. - But you didn't have to. [Door opening] [Door closes] - You try to drown me-- - shh. Quiet. What now? - Follow me. - How did they escape? Answer me! I warn you, O'Toole, we have the means here to make you answer. - It must've been by magic, captain. Maybe the little people came and got them out. - That's enough. If they are not recaptured, my friend, I'll hang you. Take him away. Warn the guards at every gate. Send patrols out. Scour the city! These prisoners must not get away! If they do, the queen will have our heads for it. See to it! - Have you any idea at all where you're going? - Yes. But all these patrols... - We're just going around in circles. - Come on. This way. This way. Half the Garrison will be-- - shh. [Soldiers marching] - Half the Garrison will be in the streets by now. Here, masters. Put these on. Quickly. - What? - They're the best I could find. But it's your only chance. - You've spent a lot of time chasing everything in skirts. Now you'll learn how it feels. - Now listen, when you leave here, turn left then right into cross street. - Cross. - The city wall's at the far end. I'll go on ahead and leave the rope hanging. I'll meet you on the other side. And I won't wait long. - Oh, wait. All right, let's go. [Laughs] - [Laughs] - Come on. - And the next one. Next one. Get down, I said! [Men's shoes splashing] - You two, hold! Ah. - Ah! - Ah! - Ah! - Go on. You go up first. - Hold there. You! Get back to the wall. Come along. Round the guardhouse. - All right. Be careful. It's my leg. - [Grunts] Aah! [Guard crashes to ground] [Soldiers chattering] - My reward now, sir. My reward. - When we are clear. - No, I told you, I'm not going with you. I'm heading for the coast. Good luck, masters. - Right, if he escaped, I'm not gambling on the search patrols finding them. We've lost our hostage so we'll take another. Donegal castle itself before the O'Donnell can reach it. - Attack the north? Without orders from england? - There's no time to wait for that. I'm taking donegal. - And taking the law into your own hands? Now with me, Leeds. - Nor with me. - You'll do as I order. - The viceroy's orders... - I don't care about the viceroy's orders. With the castle in our hands, gentlemen, O'Donnell will have to surrender. That's all that matters. And there's no time to waste. We march north now. Ho ho, but a Mark! At last there's an excuse to fight these Irish. [Goats bleating] - How do you feel? - My leg throbs. Fact that I can feel it is a good sign. Do you suppose our people know that we're free? - [Scoffs] Free? We're about as free as foxes gone to earth in a hunt. - Why don't you go on by yourself. You're the one that has to get through. - And tell your father and Kathleen that I left you? - Kathleen. No, I wouldn't want you to reach Kathleen before I do. I'm going to win that girl, Hugh O'Donnell. - You want to bet? - Certainly. [Twig snaps] - [Gasping] - If you put down that dagger, you'll be much safer at our cottage than here, master O'Donnell. [Women laugh] - [Groans] Oh, you have such a healing touch. - You lie quiet now. It is a mercy we found you before that wound had gone bad in you. - I'll be grateful to you for the rest of my life. I'll always remember you, bridgette. - Moira, not bridgette. That's my younger sister. - Moira. Oh, that's a beautiful name. As lovely as yourself. Oh, my head aches, moira. - Now, you stop that and lie quiet. [Door opens] - How is he now? - And what do you want? - He's dying. Can't you see? - Yes, I can see. - I'll, uh, I'll send in some food, your honor. - Thank you. - [Giggles] - Can't you behave? How does the leg feel now? - Oh, it's better. Sore, but better. Where are the horses? - I've hidden them. It worries me US being here. It puts these people in danger. [Door opens] - There's food for you in the kitchen, your honor. - Thank you. - Stay...here... To feed me. I-I-I feel weak. Too weak to sit up, bridgette. - I'm niav. Bridgette is my other sister. - Niav. Oh, that's a beautiful name for such a lovely girl. If you'd just like to sit here beside me... Oh, you have such a healing touch. - Now, you drink this broth. - And your hand is so cool. - Niav. We're waiting supper for you. - Yes, mother, but his--his honor here-- - if he's too weak to feed himself, I'll do it. - [Snickers] - I think I can manage, ma'am. - I'm sure you can. [Spoon bounces off floor] - You can rest here for awhile. I doubt the soldiers will come searching this far from the road. - No, no. We--we must get on as soon as it's light. We don't want to put you in more danger. You've done quite enough for US already. - 'Tis for Ireland, is it not? - [Whispers] I brought you some bread if you'd like it. - Why, thank you, bridgette. - How do you know my name? - A girl as pretty as you would have to be called bridgette. - Bridgette. - It was a kindly thought she had. - I'm sure it was. - Come on, boy. [Clicks tongue] Come on. [Clicks tongue] Choh choh choh choh choh. Choh choh choh choh choh. [Dog barking] Mother! Mother! - Mercy on US. What's this? - Have you seen any strangers hereabouts, old woman? - Strangers? - Yes. Two of them. We found their horses tethered just over the hill. So they can't be far away. - Sure I know nothing of horses, your honor. - I'm talking about men. - We have sorrow in this house this day, your honor. - Yes, you may be having more. Two of you, look out in the back. You two search this place. - Don't go into that room, your honor, sir. - Why? What are you hiding? - Hiding, sir? Sure I wouldn't dream of hiding anything on a nobel man like yourself, sir. - Quite so. Well, you just stand there. - [Crying] - Honor the dead, your worship. My old mother. She just passed away of a contagion. - [Exhales] Oh. - [Coughs] - Shh. Shh. [Shoe scrapes floor] - Have pity on our grieving. - [Exhales] - All right. I'm, uh, I'm sorry for your trouble, old woman. Mount up! Get back to the road. [People yelling, screaming] - What treachery is this? - Your son has escaped from Dublin. That is why we're here. - Hugh's free? - I'm holding donegal and you, madam, until he surrenders to me. - He will never surrender. - Not when I have you and the lady Kathleen taken to Dublin jail? - So we're fighting Irish women now, are we? - That's up to the O'Donnell. - If Hugh is free, he is not alone by now. The clans will rally to him. - That will not help you. Let him think on that. - Look. - O'Connor! - Hey, Hugh O'Donnell! - O'Connor. - O'Donnell. We've been searching the length and breadth of Ireland for you. The English have taken donegal castle. - They've taken it? - Aye. The mcsweeney's have gathered the clans. - The o'neills, the maguires. - My people, yours, all of US waiting for you. - The English have donegal. This is the main gate to the castle. We place our cannons east and west--here and here-- to fire at sunrise when the English raise their flag. Our main force will take up position here in the gully under cover of darkness and charge when the gate is open. - Opened by whom, the blessed angels themselves? - By me. I'll be inside the castle. - How? - At the foot of the north wall here is a bricked up tunnel leading to the old dungeons. Henry and I will take a raiding party, and set a mine there, and blow it when the canons fire. This should draw most of the Garrison to the walls while we get in. - To be trapped in the dungeons, it's a wild risk you're taking. - My father taught me that victory goes to him who takes the greatest risk. - Now remember, Hugh, my Kathleen and your mother are held hostage there. - That's the greatest risk of all. Well... Now is the hour we put the prophecy to test. Many here will die. But we fight for Ireland. For freedom. Every one of US. And now before we go, pray with me the battle prayer. Oh, lord god, when thou givest thy servants to endeavor any great matter, Grant US also to know that it is not the beginning, but the continuing of the same until it be thoroughly finished, which yieldeth the true glory. - Amen. - All: Amen. [Sword clinks loudly] [Footsteps approaching] - Get up. Man the ramparts! You, you, musketeers, cannoneers to the courtyard! You, get to the tower. Secure the prisoners. Come on. Follow me. - It must be Hugh. - Ah! - Oh! - Aah! - [Banging on door] [Cannon fire] - Captain Leeds! The women prisoners. They've locked themselves in the tower. - Well, break down the door, you fool! Get to them! [Cannon fire] - Come on, break it down. - Cover the gate. [Cannon fire] [Soldiers marching] [Hugh thuds against wood] - Ugh! - Aah! [Soldier crashes to ground] [Axe crashes to ground] - Captain, it's the O'Donnell! - Get him! Stop him! [Cannon fire] Get him! - Ugh. [Cannon fire] - Ah! - Forward! [Bagpipes play] * charge! [Irishmen yelling] * [Gunfire continues] - Ready! Halt! Take your aim. - Leeds! [Sword blades clashing] [Irishmen cheering] - [Grunts] [Irishmen cheering] - Go on. Go on. Kill me. Kill US all! And the queen will send an army to avenge US! - Get up. Your soldiers can go back to Dublin and say that if we're attacked again, the queen will have a war on her hands. But you stay here, Leeds. - Stay? - Until Sean O'Toole's returned to US alive. Two can play the hostage game. [Scattered laughter] [Irishmen laughing] [Scattered laughter] [Irishmen laughing] [Bagpipes play, celebrants clapping] * - The best thing about fighting is the terrible thirst it gives a man! * Now, quiet! [Bagpipe music stops] Everybody with me now! The old song! [Celebrants cheer] * proudly the note of the trumpet is sounding * - men: * loudly the war-cries arise on the Gale * * fleetly the steed by loch suilig is bounding * * to join the thick squadrons in saimear's green vale * * on every mountaineer, strangers to flight and fear * * rush to the standards of dauntless red Hugh * * connacht and gallowglass throng from each mountain pass * - now what's your name, my pretty? - Moire. - Moire. That's a name like a song. * princely O'Neill to our aid is advancing * * with many a chieftain - they're at it again! - [Laughs] - I've had enough of fighting for the day. Haven't you? Come on. Come with me. - * the borders brave from the banks of the band * * many a heart shall quail under its coats of mail * * deeply the merciless foemen shall rule * * when on his ear shall ring, borne on the breeze's wing * * tyrconnell's dread war-cry O'Donnell abu! * [singing continues] *
