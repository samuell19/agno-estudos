A small town cop who thinks he's tough is about to bust into this hallway and arrest me. Why? Because I killed 17 men. I know what you're all thinking. I don't sound like the nicest person, but you're wrong. I'm as nice as peach pie. My name's Ella. It means goddess. It wasn't that long ago when this all started. Like all people growing up. I thought the new feelings inside me were about sex. I wanted to feel desired like strippers. I had never been with a guy. I thought what better place than her to explore my urges. - With paint brushes up their asses. What do I got? You call this dancing? Look at that picture. She looks just like me. - These are the action. You know what take out your tits and show me how you do it. I was tired of being a little innocent girl. My whole life has been teddy bears and unicorns. - You gave him two black eyes and two blue balls. - At least his gonna remember his lap dance. I've had enough you can go, go, leave. Go, Go. - But, then I saw the stripper. Are those even real? Where's the appeal? - And that little sexy accent with you. Bye. - Men just sit and watch this? If this was what it meant to be wanted, - Your'e watching the same I didn't stand a chance. - Glass and not washing your wiping it. Just get out, join her, the two of yous. Janitor, you're wiping 30 years of dirt back into the floor. Join the guys, get out! You suck! All you guys just get out. I've had enough. Not you. Hold on a second, wait. - Who was I kidding? - Whoa, where you going, blondie? I just got us some alone time. Isn't that what you wanted, alone time? - I was just curious. - A little lady lost her way, huh? What'd you think goes on here kung fu classes, modern dance, ballet, Swan Lake? - I think I should go. - But, you haven't auditioned yet. - I don't think I want to. - I know why you came here. You came here to be watched. - Maybe. Come on. The urge started flowing back. - Come on! It's okay, I'm not gonna bite. Get in. - I needed to leave. - That's more like it. There you go, a little more. Find your light on that cute face of yours. Dance. I can't. - Go on. - I don't know how. At first I thought this was it. This is what I came here for to be that girl. - What's that? - I'm trying to dance. Can you please just let me leave? - Look I can make you a lot of money, little lady. You just gotta deliver the goods. - What are the goods? - You gotta flaunt your pussy, your tits, and your ass. Are you a virgin or something? - Yeah. You are? Oh, we can get rich! Guys'll pay top dollar to pop a cherry. - The girls they sleep with the guys? - So will you. The dancing is just an appetizer, a sampler, a taste. A taste? I remember my feeling at that very moment like it was yesterday. - Okay, yeah okay. Good, good, good. That's nice. - I could taste blood. He was so horrible, so disgusting that I had - You can do better. To be near him. I had to kill him. - Thank you. It was death. No, not death. - I was just scared. - Murder. - Of the feelings I felt stirring inside. No, wait not yet. I need some inspiration. - Really inspiration? Are you hungry? Cause I like to eat before I do it for the energy. - I'm okay thanks. - You sure? So does your daddy know that you're here? - I don't know my father. I think he's dead. - Good. - Okay so where is the inspiration? - Costumes. So what kind of girl are you? Touchy feely? Pain and gain? Or just playing another character? - I don't know what I'm into. - The urges were bubbling so close to the surface I could've exploded. - Browse. I needed to be useful. I needed to put these men out of their misery. - I knew it. You like it rough, huh? - My mind always seems to wander in that direction. - Now we're talking. So I'll ask you do you prefer to give the pain or receive the pain? - I don't know I haven't tried. Now's your chance to try 'cause your with an expert. - In pain? No, in sex. Don't judge a book by its cover. I've been with over 3,000 women, and I'm totally prepared for 3,001. - You are such a creep. - No, just a man with a vision. - So you're a creep with a vision? - I'll accept that. - These aren't very sharp. - It's a costume. Hey easy, easy. - But, they're not sharp. - Ow! Go easy will ya? Are you enjoying this? More than my birthday. - This is playful, come on. You're kinkier than I thought. Take something off or something. You're really getting into this, aren't ya? I wasn't getting into it. Sal? The urge was getting into me. - What? - Do you want to pop my cherry? - Does a wild bear shit in the woods? - Thank you. Are you crazy? - Pop. Aren't you gonna teach me how to dance? - It felt real. - Get away from me. Look at my face. - My Face. - It felt good. Isn't that the face of a man who deserves to die? - [Ella Voiceover The thing about small towns is that they need people like me. We may fear the deviant, but we crave it. We crave the story of the quiet girl gone mad. "She had good grades," they'd say, "She wouldn't hurt a fly." We say this to convince ourselves that we are innocent and cannot be blamed for letting the deviants run free, for letting me run free. But, we are all to blame. We in our quiet houses with our quiet lives. Without me we'd have nothing to talk about. But, I wasn't always this wise or this brave. I needed a trigger. Who would've thought I would be set free at school? It was an assignment that unleashed the killer inside of me. After all, I love homework. Good morning. Good morning. - Ladies and gentlemen, - Welcome to, hey, hey, hey. - Sorry.Yes, sir. - Pay attention. Welcome to psychology 101. My name is professor Douglas. For those of you who don't know me, I'm not really into all this regimented bullshit assignments, and announcements, and lectures, and things like that. The only thing I'm interested in is your ability to recognize the innate positions that we humans find ourselves in. And, this whole notion that we're supposed to be civilized, well I kinda wonder about that myself because I don't think we are at all. As I was saying about civilization, what are you doing there? - Me? - Yeah. I'm taking notes. - What's your name? - Ella. - You know what I haven't really said anything that's note worthy. - But, I need them. - I'll let you know when it's time to take notes, okay? - Okay. - Okay kiddos, here is your one and only assignment for the coming weeks, I know it's gonna sound bizarre, but I'd like each one of you to go out and break a sexual norm. Now wait a second. It doesn't mean you should go home and put on your sister's dress. And, for the girls, that doesn't mean I want you to walk down the street looking for clients. I don't wanna read about you in the paper or anything bad on the news. But, be creative. And, by the end of the term, I expect a presentation accompanied by a 3,000 word report about society's reaction to your breaking the mold. If you don't like that, it won't hurt my feelings if anyone wants to leave. You can start taking notes now by the way. At first, I went about it the wrong way. How could I break a sexual norm without being sexual? What was normal? I tried picturing myself with a man touching him, touching me, but it always ended up with me ripping off his dick and stabbing him in the eye with it. - Exactly, there's buying your time and being a fucking loser. She's here. - Oh no, he's actually chasing her. - Hey you, what's up? - Nothing much. - Oh wow, you've already done the readings huh? Man, that's dedication. - I think I'm just gonna fart a lot in front of people and write about that. - That's not a sexual norm. - Expecting a four-O this semester? - The way I figure it the first is the most important. I mean if you calculate it the longer you're in college, the less important your average GPA score gets with each passing semester. So I figure I'd just get cracking on it. - Sounds like you got everything working out for you then. That's not a sexual norm dumb ass. That's just nasty. - She's just breaking ridiculous norms that chauvinistic males like you put into place for her to follow in society. - Hey, have you been to any of the Psi Eta pre-fresh parties yet? - What, no. - Okay definitely the best thing about college, hands down. You should come with me sometime. Holy shit. Did he just ask me out? Blood started rushing through my body. Come sit at our table. - You don't think Douglass wants us to fuck other chicks do you? - I don't know. Either way it's not exactly a deal breaker in your book. You know I think that's exactly what he wants us to do. You should totally do that. - Really? - So you've already started in on the readings. What do you think? - Ella. Ella. - The readings keep on referencing some of Douglas's old papers. They're pretty random to be honest. One of 'em is a conspiracy theory linking a woman's political inhibitions to society's interpretation of our genitalia. - I definitely need that one. Do you have it? - Yeah sure. - Seriously who gives a shit? This is psych 101. Douglass doesn't even have tenure. - Chucky, shut the fuck up, man. She takes this stuff seriously. - I'm sorry I have to go. - No Ella, stay. Ella, let me walk you home. - Ella? I hate them! Ella. Fuck, Gerald. - How was first day of class today. - It was great. I think it's gonna be a really great year. - Good, good. What's the matter you been crying? - Oh it's just allergies. - Oh yeah, they've been really bad this year. I'm working the garden, I'm sneezing all morning. I mean you gotta take one of those little pills those, you know, those antihistamine things. You want one? - No, no. - Are you sure? - I'm fine. I'm really fine. Have a great night though. - Okay. Listen you tell your mother I've got those roses for her. - Yeah I'll let her know. - Okay, don't forget. You tell her! Wow, love your mom. What a creepy fuck. Guys like Gerald should never make it to old age! - Hey mom. - Hey honey, how was school? Did you like your classes? Any keepers? - Yep, all of them were good. I even went to The Nest with a few people afterwards. - Really? - I'm gonna go wash up before dinner. - Dinner will be ready in 20. My mother and I were close because she made us that way. She made it so that we were each other's only friend. No wonder no guy ever wanted to be with me. It was like they were dating their little sister, their little, childish, stupid, naive, immature, goody two shoes, bitchy sister! I have so much potential, right? I have class, don't I? Why do I care so much about my grades? I had to stop thinking! I started to see rivers of blood fill my house. Stop. Stop! I tried to think of Daniel. Think of him kissing me. I tried to think of him, but the rivers of blood continued to flood my head. Stop! Hun, are you okay in there? - Yeah mom. Okay well dinner's ready. Will you be down in a minute? - Yeah. No mom, I'm doing my homework. - Okay well, I'll leave a plate for you to heat up in the fridge. I'll eat and then go see Gerald. - Okay. Love you, Ella. - Love you too, mom. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars. You have a right to be here. I do have a right to be here. Dr. Douglass, you are my hero. I know it's gonna sound bizarre, but I'd like each one of you to go ou and break a sexual norm. And, I knew in that moment how I would start my assignment. - Ella, where are you going? I'm going to the library, mom. I'll be back soon don't worry. It may not have been at the library, but it was definitely for research. Are you winking at me? - I'll do anything you want, anything. - Get in the cage. Are you crazy? - Get in the fucking cage! Okay, okay. - Perfect. You're a monkey in a cage. - Stay back! - This is what you wanted, right? - I like pleasure not hurting people. - Am I fucking aggressive enough for you? - You're a fucking monster! - I'm a fucking monster? What did we say about judging books by covers? What did we say? - I'm gonna kill you! - You're gonna kill me? You're out of your element, Sal. - Just go away. Please just go away. I just wanted to see you get undressed. I was gonna get off on it that's all. I didn't mean to hurt anybody. I wasn't gonna hurt you. - You shouldn't have made me stay, Sal. - Look I said I'm sorry. Is it money? Do you want money? You want some money? - Do you hear yourself? - No, my hearing isn't so good. I'm sorry. - Sal, Sal, I'm having a really good time, aren't you? - No, no, no! Maybe a little. - Thanks for today, Sal. Heaven. I needed to know if there were others like me. I can't be the only one liberated by murder. Anything I can help you with dear? - Do you have any books on contemporary serial killers? - Oh my, give me a minute to look. Serial killer. Saying it out loud was thrilling. Is that what I wanted to be? Perhaps one day there'll be a book on me. I will leave my own legacy behind. I'll make this town famous. That's the sign of a true killer when the victims are forgotten and the myth of the murder is all that lives on. Is there ever even a book on the victims? Does anyone except their mothers even care? This is my calling. - Excuse me deary, the library's going to be closing in a few minutes, so you need to wrap up what you're doing. Ladies? This seems like a pretty graphic movie. - I wouldn't know. - And violent too, certainly no Hoosiers. - Well it looks like you made it back after all. - I think the fact that I'm in college gives me the opportunity to stay out after dark. - Ella? Hey, I'm sorry honey. It's just sometimes I don't know what to do. It just gets so lonely here. - I'm sorry. Listen I just picked up a movie from the library for my assignment kind of like a Silence of the Lambs from the wolf's point of view. Why don't we watch it together? It's really messed up. - Messed up as in what? - Violence, sex. - Oh God, I get it. Popcorn? - What did I miss? - Things are getting intense. - Alright well, you enjoy your blood, murders, and people stabbing, dear. Whatever you have to watch for class. I have to get my beauty sleep. Goodnight cupcake, I love you. - Love you too, mom. We got to get our of here. Why are you doing this? Because I can. - Hey Betty Crocker, where's my food? - Hey keep it up ass clown, and you're making your own damn food. Dude, get in here man? You gotta check this out. Fucking'ey hurry up man. This is amazing. Yeah, yeah I'm coming. You will not believe your eyes. - Chuckie Oh that's sick. Dude, look at that. - There's no way that I'm watching porn with you in the living room. Listen man, seriously what the fuck is wrong with you? I've known you since we were in diapers. - You've known me since I was in diapers, you were babysitting, and now we're both sophomores at Talmont together. - Harsh. - Seriously what do you want from me, man? - You need to get laid. You never come out and party anymore, man. It's embarrassing. - I go to every single party. Come on man, how do you think you get to these parties? I drive you. - Yeah you drive there. You stay for 30 minutes, leave, come home, fucking banana slay by yourself. Come on dude, that's no way to live a life. - Banana slay man? Seriously where do you get this shit man? - Definitely not from shit like this. What is this, Proust? Fucking Proust, man? - Yeah. - I've never seen you read that once. - That was a gift from Cathy. And yes, I have read it. I've tried to read it. - See that's my point. You could have any girl on campus, but you don't. You always go for the same nice, sensitive I knit cardigan types that never put out, ever. - Chuck, seriously stop man. I'm not even listening to you anymore. - I'm just trying to help you. I've got your back. I know what you're thinking. Don't push it with this girl. - What? Who? - Ella! How many weird girls do you want to strike out with, man? - Well I'm gonna ask her out, and we're gonna go out, and it's gonna be really nice. And, I'm gonna treat her like a lady just the way I treat you by driving your ass around everywhere and making you fucking dinner. - Fine. - Fine. - Good luck with that. - Thank you. - You know what I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna watch my adult entertainment, eat my oatmeal, and be a man. - Well that's good. Is that what men do? - Fuck you. - Have fun. Bye mom, I'm gonna be later for work. Have a good day. Okay sweetie. - Hey Ella, hey, hey. I haven't seen you around in awhile. How's it going? How's it going at the college and everything? - It's been great. I've just actually have to go. I'm late for work. - Oh yeah, are you still working at that toy store whatever it is? - Yeah I'm actually helping my mom out a lot and using my time productively, so yeah I still work there. Sure you are. Yeah great, you've got time for, you know, a little. - Well I've gotta get going. Iced tea? - Oh my, okay I've gotta go. - Listen I'm sorry. That's on a timer. You wanna put your clothes in the drier for a couple of minutes? Ella? Bitch. - I realized he was watching me. He was like Sal. They all are. I had to stay focused and keep up the charade. A nervous Ella was a caught Ella. - Miss, I think you're gonna hurt him. - What's going on here? Do we think we just build stuffed puppies? We don't. We build dreams. If you don't understand that, let me know! Cause unless you want to be fired right here, right-- - It exploded in my hands. Men were like puppies all innocent and adorable, but all they really want is to hump your leg, sniff your crotch, and piss ont the floor - Maybe you should just go home for the day. I wanted to twist his head off and paint this place with his arterial spray. I was no longer a pushover. Mommy, Fred's dead! - What the fuck? - Hey? Whoa, relax. Cute job, stuffing puppies all day. At least there's worse ways to make minimum wage. - You done? Can I go now? - Look I'm sorry. I was kind of a dick at The Nest, but I mean you're kinda weird as shit. Come on. Wait, I'm sorry for real. - What do you want? - Okay look my friend is kind of an idiot. But, he likes you, alright? He's a nice guy. He's a lot nicer than me. And, I think that you should give him a chance. - Are we talking about Daniel? - Of course we're talking about Daniel, who else? Okay so I'm gonna give you his number, and maybe you should give him a call. Okay, 555-1957. - No fucking way. - Got that? Alright. Thanks. Hey and maybe put out, yeah? Awesome. - I'm gonna kill him. Chuck, do me a favor. Please tell me that wasn't you talking to Ella. - Hell yes it was. I gave her my number. - Done. Congratulations, you fucked me. Damn it, Chucky! How is it that you're always the one to fuck this shit up for me, man? - Relax man, I gave her your number. Just chill, wait for her to call you. We both know that you're too pussy'ed to ask her out yourself. - You're an asshole. - You're welcome. - Fuck you. Are they mocking me? They thought they could get the upper hand? No way I was going to fuck them up. Ella hey. Perfect, Gerald. - Ella listen I just want to apologize about this morning. I do, I'm so sorry. The sprinklers are on timers. - I'm fine. Are you sure? - Yeah it's fine. - Did you get wet or anything? - I'm okay. - Oh okay. I mean if it wasn't so tragic, it was actually funny. Listen how is your mother? She's a little, How can I be kind here. She's a moody woman because I was looking out of my window, I mean, just by chance. I wasn't being nosy or anything. I just happened passed, and when I looked out, you know, I could've sworn she gave me the finger. - Yeah well, Mr. Porterson can I talk to you for a minute? - Let me check my diary. Whoa, I think you can talk with me for a minute. Listen why don't you call me Gerry? - Okay. - Say that, Gerry. - Gerry. Well hi there. - Gerry. - I expect you'd like an iced tea wouldn't you? - Sounds good. - Yeah, come on inside. It's only instant I'm afraid, but I put a little bit of sugar in it for you like you're not sweet - It's fine. Enough, hey? Well here down the hatch. Delicious. So, how is everything? What's on your mind? - We were given this assignment in psychology class. I'm just not sure how I'm gonna go about doing it. - Really? - Yeah I mean I have an idea. It just calls out to me at every turn. Even a few days ago I tried just in a small way, but it upset me. I'm thinking that maybe it wasn't with the right person, and if it was with the right person then, it'd be different. - What kind of assignment are we talking here? - I'm supposed to do something I wouldn't normally do. - Really? Do something you wouldn't normally do, I like the sound of that, I do. I mean that opens up a whole can of worms right there, right? It's just like your mom says, "You can do "anything you want as long as you make up your mind." - Mr. Porterson. - Gerry, Gerry. - Right, Gerry. - Thanks. I almost felt sorry for him. Almost. - Hey baby, how was work? I hope that jerk Randolph didn't ask for you number again. Oh my God what happened? I'm fine, mom. Really I'm fine. Listen mom, I'm gonna go get cleaned up, and then we'll eat. Sound good? - Okay. I wished she were more proud of me. I wished she understood how big this was. Her little girl was becoming a woman before her eyes. It was exhilarating. With Sal, it was just a shock. This time I got to enjoy it. I felt my whole body quiver. Lust, excitement. - Good advice. I can teach you. You can learn from me. That wasn't very nice. That's not funny. This is what people talk about. This was pleasure. This was my coming of age. - Gerry - Gerry What happened with Gerald changed everything. I felt prepared to go out with Daniel, a woman ready to take on the world. You're wasting your time reading that Proust, dude. Nothing I've heard has helped me get laid except for instructions on a box of condoms. Trust me. Are you even listening to me? Daniel, bro are you even listening to me? - Hey dude. - What? What's going on, bro? - She text, buddy. Ella text, man. - Wicked. I can't wait to hear about your Mormon date. Jack ass. - You're still pregaming with me. I already called a bunch of people. - That's nice. - Yo, send the bitch a smiley. Bitches love smileys. - Thanks, bro. He texted me a smiley face. Nobody has able texted me a smiley face except my mom. I think I'm in love. - Hey mom, I've been thinking. I think it's time I quit that ridiculous place. I mean the work doesn't really do much for me, and everyone's still in high school except for Randy. Plus, I've got a full time course load going on with Talmont University. I've outgrown it. - Well you do have a lot going on. You want to watch a movie tonight, but this time I get to choose? - Actually I was planning on going out with a few friends from class. - Really, friends make a-- - Well rounded life. - When I met your father-- - Mom, don't talk about him. It only upsets you. - You know me too well. - I guess I do. I pitied her at that moment more than ever before. - So do you know what you're gonna wear. - It was for her. - Remember that really cute outfit I got for my birthday last year? I think I'm just gonna go with that? - I was her strength now. - Oh honey, is there someone there you're trying to impress? - No, it's not even like that. It's not even that intense. - Okay Miss Fashionista, well you have to go and get ready. I'll clean up down here. I've got all of this. - You're the best, and I promise one day soon, it'll be Hoosiers. - You know, I'm always going to be with you no matter what happens. I believe in us. I love you I always will. We can still raise this child together. I'm thinking of Ella. How far in you wanna go? Hun? I felt more beautiful than ever. My first real date, and I had a chance at happiness, Of being normal. And, then the urge came over me. I needed the blood. I needed to see it, and smell it, and touch it. I bet dad would've understood. Mom knew and was hiding it from me. I didn't know why. I was afraid to know. Chucky, where the hell are my keys, man? - I have no idea. I don't drive. You drive remember? That's our thing. - Fuck dude, you drink too much. Oh my fucking God, are you kidding me right now? Anybody seen my fucking keys? No, no keys? Outstanding. Excuse me. Chuck, I'm not fucking around. I'm 45 minutes late. She's gonna freak. - Dan, I set you up on this date. Why would I take your keys? Again, I was a fool. I waited almost an hour hoping he'd come. I wanted to kill every guy in the room, and I held back for him, for Danny. That selfish asshole! I was done holding back. I needed to come out and play. Yo man, you see that hot piece of ass staring at us? - Bro, I need me to get a piece of that right now, bro. - Just fine, here she comes, be cool. - I know, man. I've got dibs, she's mine. - I think she's coming. I hope you haven't brought no dibs. Flap your wings, bro. - I can show you exactly what you've been missing. - Oh my God, really? Cool, cool. - Do you have a car or something? - Yeah, I've got a car. You lead the way. Baby, you are getting to be the hottest rebound that I have ever had. - Guess, I am. - Come on in. Baby, how 'bout some music? - Yeah whatever you want. - Really? Alright. Yeah, you sure? - Yeah turn it up. - Hey what was that? - Protection. Good thinking, baby, good thinking. I didn't even give him a chance to get hard. I wanted to ensure that as much blood as possible would spill from his neck before it blindly rushed to his dick. - Damn, that was fast. What happened? - I hope you last longer. - Ella? Ella? Do you know what time it is already? And, you're covered in blood again. I have been waiting up half the night for you just to make sure you get home safe and to see how your night was. What happened? - It's a long story. I got to the frat house, and Daniel met me outside. We head on inside and grab a beer. So we're just having a good time. And, some guy comes up to Daniel, starts accusing him of sleeping with his ex or something. Then Daniel flips out and takes a swing at him. So one of the Psi Eta guys had a pocket knife on him and stabs the guy and slashed him right in the shoulder. There was blood everywhere. He should be fine though. - Did you call the police? - I'm sure Courtney took care of it. I just wanted to come home. - Okay. - All I want to do is just get out of these clothes, take a bath, and get to bed. It's been a crazy night. Baby? - Yeah mom. - You did everything right. My mother told me that night what really happened. She loved my father, and when he started to bring home bodies, she did whatever she could to protect him. But, he got strange when she got pregnant as if terrified that his urges would get transferred to the baby, to me. How far in do you want to go. He took her deep into the woods to dispose of the bodies, but what he really wanted to dispose of was her. A little help here wouldn't hurt. She survived, and so did I. That smack on the head sure explains a lot about her though now that I think about it. - You were perfect. But more than that, knowing about my dad explains a lot about me. That I was meant to be. Best of all, she thinks that he's still out there. I had no choice but to embrace what I have always been. I would imagine the American Psychiatric Association just wants to create as many disorders as they possibly can. With so many new and improved mental disorders, I couldn't help wondering how many I might have. Professor Douglas has a few disorders. Here's the handouts for those who need them. You know my hours. All of them, idiots. Daniel was pitiful. Too weak to admit his own douchebaggery. If only they knew what I was. Soon enough they would. I was getting ready to tell my story and blow this assignment out of the water. - I'm gonna get an A in your class. - Really? Dr. Douglas was going to be very proud. - I guess we'll see about that. I was thinking I'd start a guidebook like a How-to which knives are best, which cuts bled out the most. This was the most fun assignment I'd ever gotten. - Hey. Do you mind if I sit down? - I guess not. I couldn't believe that Daniel had the guts to confront me after standing me up. I didn't know what it was about him. Anyone else, I'd have gutted by now. - What are you working on? - The assignment, our psychology class. - Yeah, I meant we still have quite a bit of time to finish that. Why're you working on it already? - Because I just want to get it done. - Makes sense. - Listen Ella, I'm really sorry about-- - I don't really care. Okay, I'd really like to make it up to you. - How? - I'd like to take you for drinks. Nobody's really doing anything. - Alright but the drinks are on you, Daniel. - Yeah of course absolutely. - Pick me up around eight o'clock. - Eight's good, absolutely. I didn't know what I wanted to do with him yet. He's the only one I couldn't figure out, not like the other boys. - Wear something nice. - I've got it covered. - That's yours. If my dad's out there, I hope he's proud of me. I wonder'd how many he's killed. I wonder if he has his legacy that will one day be discovered. I couldn't wait for the day I no longer had to hide any of this. - Mom? Mom? - Ella are you all right? - I can't get the stains out. - From the blood? Were you using hot water? - Yeah. - You can't use hot water on blood, honey. Also this one is dry clean only. - Shit. - What did you want it cleaned up so quickly for? - I have another date with Daniel. It's my only nice dress, and now it's ruined. - Another date huh? I hope this time it doesn't end in a blood bath. Why don't you borrow one of my dresses. I've got a couple of cool ones from awhile ago when I was your size. It may be a little retro though. - From the '80s? - Yeah retro is cool now, right? It's not that bad, is it? Here at least give me a chance to show you what I have maybe you can make some of this work. Believe me honey I can put you something that shows just as much. The one thing that's timeless is a man's response to curves. - I guess it's worth a shot. - I used to knock 'em dead in my day. - That makes two of us. - Wow. Ella you look amazing. - Thanks Daniel, you clean up pretty nice yourself. Thanks. - Oh my God, Daniel are you all right? - Excuse me, mam? - Ella told me what happened the other night. That must've been terrible. - Yeah, it was terrible. It was really bad. - But, you seem to be a quick healer so thank God for that, right? - Well look at the time. Thanks mom, but we really need to get going. - Ella, can we just have a quick word with you privately please? Believe in yourself honey. - I know. - You can be the very best. Your father never believed in me, never believed in either of us. - Mom, I really gotta go. - And, I would appreciate it if you were home a little earlier tonight yes? - Don't worry I promise. Daniel will make sure. - Yes. Your daughter's in safe hands. I was in safe hands, my own. I wondered who was watching out for Daniel tonight. She knew that the only one in danger was him. So what was your mom talking about back there? Don't worry about it. Well I mean it involved me didn't it? - Yeah well I got home super late and wasted the other night. I had to give her an excuse so. - There first thing that came to mind was me? - You got beat up in the story. - At least I know you're thinking about me. - I have been. You don't have to worry about that. Let the fun begin. - Though I'm not crazy about the whole coming home really late, plastered thing, and I hate to preach. So you live with your mom still, huh? That's cool. - Yeah, well I actually grew up here. - Really? No way I grew up here. You didn't go to Talmont High, did you? I don't remember seeing you there. - Did you keep your eye out for all the younger girls? - No, no, no thankfully Chucky does enough of that for everyone. - Yeah well I was actually home schooled. Living at home isn't actually the hard part. It's having to deal with everyone who's moved on and think I can't. - Yeah that's fair. Our school offered me a lacrosse scholarship. What was happening to me? - But, I don't see myself staying here forever. - So where we headed. - There's a really nice hotel bar. You know what you probably know it. It's called the Well View. - Nice I'm excited. - Oh and the best part, my brother's old roommate's the bartender, so we're not getting ID'ed. - Better still. As we pulled up, another sensation came over me. The desire to actually go on a date. The date I have been yearning for, a chance to be normal. - Gen. Ed's leaving absolutely no breathing room and all the extra classes and trying to keep the GPA up and staying focused on the team. Did you play any sports in high school? - No, advanced couch potato. - Nice. Any hobbies or extra curriculars? - One, I don't really like to talk about it at least not yet. It gets me out of the house. - You look really great. I used to fantasize about meeting a girl like that in college. - Okay. - I mean unintentionally creepy. I'm sorry about that. What I meant was they inspired me. - Inspired you to jerk off? - What? No, no. They reminded me, you remind me of them. - So you're gonna jerk off thinking of me? - So your mom she's pretty cool, eh? She's a bit on the eccentric side. I mean cool though. Where's your dad? - He's not a part of this. - This? What is this? Part of me wanted to open up to him, another part thought it'd be simpler to filet him. - Look I'm just trying to learn a little bit more about you. I think you're a really, really interesting girl, and I really want to get to know you better. No, hidden agendas, no mixed messages, honest. I really like you. - I think it's about time you take me back to your place. - Right. Hey what are you doing here? Just hearing his voice made me want to take out the knife. - Chucky, what the fuck man? - Yo man, nice! - Awesome, listen Chuck, we're gonna take off, okay? - Yeah we should go. - Hey you're looking pretty nice tonight. The girls and me are thinking about checking out the lake. You coming? - Uh-uh, no. We're on our way out, right Ella? - You know what it doesn't really matter to me. - Your're awesome. These are on you. - So not many people here at night. - No, it probably wouldn't be so romantic if it was as packed as Fenway, right? - It's not like come here all the time. Really I thought you came here all the time. - Me? - What Chuck is trying to say is you're really pretty. I bet you get asked out a lot. - Smooth Daniel. No seriously, Astroglide smooth. - Would you two shutup! I've got yoga in the morning. - I admit that I was confused. I got a slow dance chubby just looking at you. - This would've been perfect. All four of them slaughtered like the pigs they were. But, I couldn't do it. I just liked him. - Holy shit. So What are you thinking about? - I most definitely know what you're thinking about. - Ella no, it's not like that. Ella! We're having a good time. Ella! Fuck me. Fuck her Daniel. It's all the same in back. - What the fuck is wrong with you, man? - She's just a weird bitch, take Courtney. - Chucky, I gotta, I'm going after her. - Take Courtney. You dick. - I'm going after her. - One sec. Baby, I'm just gonna go for a quick pee. - No problem. I'll be right here. - Holy shit! What are you doing? - Don't come any closer, Daniel. - Ella, what's going on? Why the fuck do you have a knife? Are you okay? Did somebody try and hurt you? - Yes, no, I don't know. I've done some things. - Ella, please I just need you to understand. I would never to anything that you didn't want to do. It wasn't my intention. Okay? I'm not good at this stuff. - You don't understand, Daniel! - Oh my God, I can't believe it! Gerald's dead. That's the last of the pruned roses I'll ever get. - What are you staring at? - He's gone forever. Poor Gerald. - What? Just like on TV. He must've gone awhile ago. I haven't noticed him eyeing me recently pretending to prune his shrubs. Still poor guy. No one to notice him dying. All alone in this cruel, cruel world. Are you okay, sweetheart? - Yeah, I'm fine. For a moment, I thought I felt remorse. Someone real is gone because of me, a person with a life and a past. But, then I realized that the feeling wasn't remorse at all. It was excitement. I had purpose. I never felt better, and I wanted to feel it again and again. But, something was missing. - Hey what's up, babe? Daniel, are you at home? - Yeah, I'm home. Is it all right if I come over? - Yeah, what time were you thinking? I'm just finishing up my paper. One sec! Shit, no, not you. I got, somebody's at the, I'm coming just give me one second. Hey how'd you get here so fast? Come in. Are you okay? Do you want some water? Ella, everybody's done something that they're not proud of. It's human nature. Nobody's perfect. - I've been going out at night. It started with Dr. Douglas. He sent me. So I did it to this creep at the club and my neighbor Gerald, and then there were these two guys I met at a club, and it just got out of control from there. - Do you like the things that you've been doing? I did at first. Sometimes it just makes me so happy. I always end it feeling empty inside. Ella. - No, Daniel you don't understand. I know I don't understand, but I'm trying. I'm really trying to understand. I can't stand being in my head anymore, I'm sick. - I think I have to just have to try something more normal. Fine so a good, solid dry hump wasn't technically a loss of virginity, but it was close. - Wow. Do you feel anymore normal now? - I don't think I'll ever feel normal. But, I'm okay with that. - You know I don't always feel normal either. - Really? - Yeah. My dad left us almost 10 years ago now. Yeah he moved more than 30 miles away, never saw him again. He's got a new family and all. - Do you ever think about doing anything about that? - Yeah, the guy's a class act asshole. What are you gonna do, right? Yell at him, hit him? - I can think of a few things. I realized then that I was never going to change, but at least, I can kill with a purpose. Daniel and I were a team now. And, I would do anything for him. - You know I was just making my Christmas list and psycho bitch with a knife wasn't on it. You don't have to be here. You can turn around and walk away. - Whoa, Whoa, whoa You're not gonna say that shit in my classroom, in this university, not gonna happen. You understand? You're taking it too far. Excuse me? - Excuse you? There is no excuse for what you're saying! - I followed your instructions to the letter. Sir, I deserve an A. - An A? Guess what you deserve to fail for the semester. You just shut up. Shut up! We got a very serious situation here obviously. I need everybody to clear out. Let's go. Let's make it fast. Don't you move. Come here. Sit down. Sit down. Okay. Let me wrap my head around this. I'm supposed to believe that this is all true, is that it? What is this your workbook? - It isn't fiction. - Oh my God. You think I'm gonna let you bring this university down to its knees? You know the wreckage that you've caused in people's lives if this is even possibly true? - So you called me to talk. What to tell me I've been deviant? - Deviant? Give me that fucking thing? What is this the murder weapon? Baby, you're done! You want me to believe you killed 17 people? - One by one. - I'm done with this whole stinking mess. Take your little toy. Enjoy your freedom while you have it, baby. And, here we are back to where we started. I will not walk out of here ashamed. I am a hero. I'm the lady psycho killer of everyone's dreams. Freeze, do not move. Put the weapon down now. My name's Ella. It means goddess. Sir, please stand back, sir. Sir, stand back sir. Sir, please stand back. Poor Daniel. I should've told him. - I gotta get to her! But, now he has to share me and my legacy with the world. - Ella. Ella, what's going on? Ella, where are they taking you? Ella! Ella, what's going on? Where are they taking you? Ella! Of course I do haven't you seen what I left around town. I mean the first one was an accident. - Stop - And, then I needed again. And, then there was Gerald who I practically served to you although it took you guys forever to find him. - Enough. Finished? Good. Cause I've had it. I have no time to waste with you and your fantasy bullshit. While we've been babysitting you, whoever is killing people, got another one yesterday. - Same MO, male victim, multiple stab wounds. - You're free to go. I tell you you need professional help. Daddy? Could it be? I never thought I'd say this, but I can feel him out there. - You don't understand, Daniel. Looking out for me. He always tried to protect me, and now he is. Don't worry this is for real. I don't want to hurt Daniel. The only thing I want to stab him with is my tongue. I think I'm in love. - Where do you want to go? - Let me drive. - Hi sweetheart, ready to go? - So where are we going? - It's time for us to find my dad. - I'm still a virgin.
