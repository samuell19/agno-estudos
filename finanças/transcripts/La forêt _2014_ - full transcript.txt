The Forest Karp Savalitch? Karp? Did Raisa Pavlovna call me? Yes, Miss. Only now that the guests are here, Madam is in the garden. Listen, Karp. Could you...? - Miss wishes that I... - Pass this on. You know to whom. It's a bit embarrassing. It's true, no? Your aunt wishes to see you with the gentleman. Too bad. As you wish. All right. If you wish. It's okay because it's you. Has Madam sold the forest? Madam sold it to Ivan Petrovitch. We're selling it all. And for what? So the forest doesn't go to her heirs. Believe, Miss. The money will be for my dowry. God be praised! No. Karp Savalitch! God forbid. As you wish, Miss. I was only saying better it go for your dowry than to leave like that. - Mr. Alexei Sergueitch! - Karp! - Did you roll my cigarettes? - No. And why not? I gave you an order. - When I have time. - You're a braggart. - I'll tell Madam. - No, you won't. You don't smoke around her. - Are you crazy? - Sorry. Taking on airs? Why offend me? I like you. What do I have to do? What gives you the right to touch me? I can't anymore? Who, me? Not touch? Who will stop me? What if I belonged to someone else? Whims. You're going to ruin it. Ruin what? Ruin what? Madam wants me to marry you. And you and I are poor. So? Wait to be pursued? Where will I go? Return to my mother? What do you want? - I think I forgot... - You didn't forget anything. I can't even come in? When you're called, I'll tell you. So stubborn! Why so holier than thou? Madam has promised money. Is that not enough? Money can buy certain things but not others. You don't know what money is. And you don't know misery. People sell their souls for money. People can't love on command, Alexei Sergueitch. You won't do better than me. You're mistaken. Maybe I already have. - Karp? - Yes? If Madame asks for me, I'm in my room. Oh, sir... - What? - You are young. - I know. - And it's not right. What should I do? It doesn't favor you. Why do you run after Miss? I don't know. You need to be more careful. Will it please Madam? You say "get married"... Perhaps she'll ask you to do something else. You're no free man. Only our governor understands me. And Father Gregory. Raisa Pavlovna, believe me, everything noble and magnificent... I gladly believe you. Alexei! Gentlemen, may I introduce a young aristocrat, Alexei Sergueitch Boulanov. His future is very interesting. I'm going to tell you. - One of your relatives? - No. Not a relative. This young man is my friend's son. A friend whom I saw last year in St. Petersburg. Long ago, we were like sisters. I became a widow. She married. I had advised against it. Having tried it, I had a distaste for marriage. For marriage, not men. For men, too. Especially men like you. Raisa Pavlovna, by her life's harshness, is the jewel of our province. When we met again, my friend had long been a widow. She regretted not listening to my advice. Crying, she introduced her only son to me. As you've seen, he is already of age. - He'll be a soldier. - No. He has a fragile constitution. He was suffering. His mother was, too. An estate completely ruined. The son had to study to feed his mother. Time and the taste for study passed. Well, judge me as you wish, I decided to kill three birds with one stone. - How? - Strange. - "Three birds"? - Reassure the mother, give the son means, and find a match for my niece. He came for the summer to get acquainted. Next I'll marry them and give a dowry for my niece. There, gentlemen. Now you know my intentions. If tongues were wagging, you would explain everything. Everything beautiful and noble will one day be known. Recently I have been oppressed by a sort of premonition. The idea of imminent death never leaves my mind. Gentlemen... I am going to die soon. And I even... Yes... I want to die. Oh, there will be tears! I must finish my duties for my heirs. Gentlemen, give me your guidance. Very well. As for close relatives, there is only my husband's nephew. I haven't seen my nephew in 15 years. No news. But he is alive. I know it. He sends me gifts every year. Where is he? I don't know and thus can't write to him... but I have a debt to him. What is his occupation? I don't know. He was bound for the army. Good. He was 15 when his father died. However young I was, I already had firm ideas about life. I raised him according to my manner. I prefer a simple but strict upbringing. - Such people are happier. - Wrong. Holed coins buy nothing. He doesn't complain about his rearing. He even thanks me. That's nice. Life was his school. I prepared him to be a midshipman, while supporting him financially. - Fewer problems. - I sent him money, but very little, honestly. - And he began to steal. - You're mistaken! Look at what he wrote me. I always keep this letter on me. Read it, Evgueni Appolonitch. "My dear aunt and benefactor, Raisa Pavlovna, "It is by this letter, devoted to this life of mine, "that I write to you with sorrow, even hopelessness, about my needs. "Oh, destiny... "Under the yoke of ignorance, shamed by my comrades, "I foresee failure in my future." So far, nothing that flatters you. Listen. "But I fear not. "Glory lies before me. "Glory! "Your meager charity often pushed me to the edge of misery and ruin. "All the same, I kiss your dear hand. "All the years of my childhood until this so-called maturity, "my predestinations were unknown. "But now, "all is opening up before me." The style is beautiful. His feeling is not feigned. Ivan Petrovitch Vosmibratov is here with his son, Madam. Excuse me for seeing a mujik in your presence. Be careful. He's a crook. Oh, you know, he's such a good family man. Sit down, Ivan Petrovitch! Sit down, Piotr. Should I continue reading? Read on, Evgueni. "Necessity, you are impenetrable. "I thank you. "Thank you. "Soon, my name will be immortal, "and with it, yours will also live on for posterity. "Children and grandchildren. "Again, I thank you for everything. "At your service, your devoted... "nephew, "a child of nature... "sustained on misfortune... "Gourmyjski." Thank you. Let's ask an ordinary man. He'll tell the truth. Is this letter well written? First-rate! This letter is 12 years old. What's become of him and his dazzling glory? I don't know. One fine day, you'll see. This letter makes me proud. To tell the truth, I love him very much. Come to dinner the day after next. You won't refuse to countersign my will. It will be ready. You are welcome to come. Gentlemen, in two days, then. - Did you bring the money? - No, Madam... If you need it, I'll stop by tomorrow. - Would you like a vodka? - No, thank you. So tomorrow, bring it all, as agreed. But I no longer remember... Do not worry, Madam. 1,500, I believe. Where is the note? Look for it. In any case, this sum is not enough. Care to buy another parcel? Why don't you sell the entire forest? Why do you want to keep it? Believe me, a forest is nothing, but a disaster. Peasants who steal are taken to court. It is next to the city. Convicts will seek shelter there. No, I won't sell all of it to you. It's not an estate without a forest. It's not pretty. Don't you want to buy another parcel? Why wouldn't I buy it if you gave me a good price? But I confess that I came about another affair. Meaning? You have a relation, a girl who is poor. - And? - My son saw her, I don't know where. - Maybe it was here. - Him? - Yes. - Piotr, Madam. Madam. If you gave us 4,000 with which to settle down, it would suit us. I appreciate you very much, but I'm sorry, she already has a fiancé. He lives here. Do you hear that? Want to make a fool of me? No... Now, about the forest. Buy it, Ivan Petrovitch. I lack funds. If Madam gave us a good price, then maybe. How much would you offer? Would 500 do? What? One parcel for 1,500 and the other for 500? That one's better! It's bigger! I spoke without thinking. My mind is not really on it right now. - Your price? - At least 2,000. A bit of advice: say yes. I didn't mean to offend. Thank you, but it's not worth it. How disgraceful... I'm all alone. It's easy to hurt a woman who's all alone. Because it's you, I'll sell it for 1,500. That's a bit pricey, but if you want to. I'll need the money tomorrow. You'll be sleeping when I come with it. Madam, I'd be grateful if you drafted a document: "For the forest, sold in sections, "I have received the entire sum requested." So you'll bring me exactly 3,000? I'll bring what's needed. Farewell, Madam. - Madam? - Yes? You deigned to ask for Miss. She is waiting. Call her. You probably know why I had Alexei Sergueitch come. Yes. Don't dream about it. It's still just a supposition. You might get passionate and err. - That'd make me sad. - Why would I do that? She's asking again! Wouldn't he be a good match for you? I wonder if you deserve him. - You also need to ask me. - Don't lecture me. People must think he is your fiancé. I need this. Don't be a flirt and don't take any liberties. What liberties? You're offended! It's charming. Sweetie, I can think what I want about you. A street urchin with a sled. I didn't always do that. At 6, I was helping my mother work. My dear, they're watching relentlessly. He's your fiancé, and it's sour grapes. Who would want a fiancé like him? What good is this farce? I won't marry him. Even if it is, I feed you and clothe you. I'll make you. The two of you are engaged except that you'll stay in your room. - Anything else? - No. You may leave. - Oulita? - Madam? I have my eye on everything here. You're right about that. I don't trust Aksioucha. She is crafty. She is often with Alexei. She doesn't dare in front of me, but if I'm not there, they go to the park or are in the house together. - I order you... - I understand. I understand. I have long watched them like a hawk. They won't make a move without me. This is why I like you. You understand quickly. I understand right away. Oulita, tell me... When you see a handsome young man, don't you feel something? Don't you think that it's nice to love? I'm an old lady! I've forgotten. Oh, you're not old yet, come on! Tell me. Just like a dream, like... Like a little cloud... You disgust me. The boy certainly is handsome. How young I still feel... in my soul. Petroucha! How are you? A bit worse. Are you marrying a noble? Stop. You know it won't happen. Are you upset? "It won't happen"? When... Fear not. Who do you belong to? Are you free or are you not? I'm free, my dear. Father just mentioned you, and Madam: "She's engaged." Though she'd be happy to be rid of me, she clings to her money. What dowry does your father want? Under 3,000, he'll refuse. Less and it won't have been worth feeding me. He'd prefer that I marry a goat. 3,000... I'll never be able to get it. - Are you free? - Me? I belong to others. I'm a convict, hands and feet bound. You're so sad and mean... What do I have to celebrate? What do you have to celebrate? Look at the girl who loves you. I'm thinking, but my brain's... You should be thinking about me. I'm thinking about you, Aksioucha. I have 300 rubles. If I look around Father's office for money, there might be enough. And what then? You, me, and a troika! Whip, driver! We'll head for the Volga and board a steamer! One day in Kazan, another in Samara! Living as we wish! Nothing is too much. And once we've spent all our money what will we do? I haven't thought about it... Either we come back to make amends... or we find a high cliff and a deep ravine. Or a water hole with a strong eddy. And then... splash! Like a rock. No, Petia. Try the first one. Tomorrow night, try to come to the park. We go to bed early. Arkadi? It's me. Guennadi? In the flesh. Where are you going? I'm going to Kerch. And you? - Are you on foot? - My own two feet! - And you? - A stagecoach. Why are you asking? Can't you see, you fool? No, no. I was just saying. Let's sit down, Arkadi. - Where? - Me here, and you wherever you want. Okay... What's this satchel? A splendid thing. I made it myself for the road. What's inside? A few things, old boy. Good ones. A Jew made them in Poltava. At the time, I had a lot of things made: a top hat, two wigs... and a good pistol... The trigger's broken. I'll get it fixed someday. Too bad there's no tailcoat. I had a tailcoat, but I traded it for a Hamlet costume. "Alas, poor Yorick!" "Alas, poor Yorick!" "Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft." "Where be your gibes now? "Your gambols, your songs?" How I could have played it... What's in the bundle? - A library. - A big one? About thirty plays. Do you have any dramas? Two. It's mostly vaudeville! - Why lug it around? - Worth the price. Also a few little accessories... medals, an epaulet. - Did you steal it all? - And proud of it. - Where are your clothes? - Everything is on me. I haven't had anything for a long time. How do you get through the winter? Others have their money, the tramp has his head. So you're going to Vologda? There are no more troupes. And you, going to Kerch! None in Kerch, either. What to do, huh? The last time we saw each other, you were playing a lover. - What did you do after that? - I played in comic roles. But comics are everywhere. So I went from a comic to a prompter. Quite a number, when you're a great soul... Prompter... An ordinary lot, old boy. They sent me on my merry way... Play the fool. No genius required. Try playing a tragic character. No one's doing it anymore. Why the Spanish goatee? - No? - It's ugly. It's filthy! Shave it off or let your beard grow. - A full beard's no good. - What? - My whiskers are feathers. - Shave it, I tell you. I'll shave it. Yes. Down south, I was really in a bad way. Why? My personality, old boy. You know me, I'm a lion. I don't like disgrace. That's my problem. I got mad at all the directors. A lack of respect, old boy. Schemes... No respect for the art. So I'm trying my luck in the north. It's the same for us. You won't last long. Just like me. - You comparing us? - My personality's better. I'm gentle. I'm a gentle soul. I've never hit anyone! It was you who got hit! Some people hit and others are hit! - Do you dare? - No, I... I left the theater, and it pains me now. My God, how good I was! How good I was! Very well. So good that... Oh, why even talk to you? You don't understand. Last time, in Lebedian, I played Belisarius. Nikolai Ribakov himself came. After the last scene I went into the wings. And who did I see there? Nikolai Ribakov. - He put his hand on my shoulder. - Don't hurt me! It's okay. It's just to show you. OK, but I got hurt once like that. After the last scene, I went into the wings. There was Nikolai Ribakov. "You", he said, "and I," he said, "are going to fade away!" Flatterer! - Got any tobacco? - Not a bit. You don't have your reserves? You're stupid. - You are, too. - Any money? No. I never have much, and now, nothing. You can't travel without tobacco or money. It's better this way. No one will rob me. Could you spare a little? I have a big heart, but I won't give you money. As for your complaining, yes. Don't you have family in the area? No. They wouldn't give me money. I wasn't talking about money. It would be good to rest from the journey, taste some homemade pies, liqueurs... How come you don't have any family or friends? - Neither do you! - Yes, I do. I didn't want to stop by. I'm too proud. We're free men. We have fun. We like the tavern! I know what family is. I lasted 3 months, doing nothing. I had enough. I said: "I'll visit my uncle." And I left. For a long time, they didn't let me in. They looked at me through the window. Finally, he comes and says: "What are you doing here?" "I came to see you, Uncle." "So have you dropped all the artsy stuff?" I said, "Yes." "Here's a cubby hole for you. Stay, but first, go to the bar." I stayed there. They got up at 4 am, they ate lunch at 10 am. At 7, bedtime. Limitless vodka at meals, and after lunch, a nap. No more talking. You'd have thought they were dead. At dawn, my uncle went to the shop, and my aunt, the entire day, drank tea and sighed. She looked at me, moaning and saying: "Unlucky you, soul killer!" Our whole conversation. "Soul killer, isn't it time to come to dinner?" Or: "Aren't you going to bed, "soul killer?" What do you expect? I sure got my strength back. And suddenly I got an idea: what if I hung myself? I tried to forget it, but at night, same thing. What if I hung myself? It turned sour. At night, I even ducked out the window. That's what family is for us. I would never go, either, but to be honest, I'm tired. If we could find an actress... a young, dramatic actress. What a troupe we'd have. - Only there aren't anymore. - Not anymore. Do you understand what a dramatic actress is? You know the actress I need? I need something with soul. With life. With fire. A woman who throws herself into a pond for love, that's an actress. I'd need to see it myself, or I wouldn't believe it. I'd pull her from the water... Then, I would believe. Okay. Shall we go? Where? I haven't gone back in 15 years. I never forget about her. I sent her gifts, Turkish slippers, turquoise, a rosary... It'd be nice to be in a coach, but on foot, dressed in rags... I have my pride, Arkadi. So do you. There'll be space for you. What's this place? Read. "The Les Souches estate, property of Madam Gourmyjskaïa." My soul guides my miserable destiny. Your hand, comrade. Hello, Raisa Pavlovna. Hello, my friend. - How are you feeling? - Fine. Thank you. Come in. I feel refreshed this morning. Even though I didn't sleep well. - Alexei, do you believe in dreams? - Of course. Some dreams stay with you the whole day. What was your dream? I won't say it all. Sharing one's dreams is sharing one's most inner thoughts. I'm a woman, you're a man. What does that matter? You're so innocent! I dreamed about you. About me? - That makes me happy. - Really? Yes. You thought of me before bed. No, really? You're happy about it? Yes. I thought you were upset about something and you'd send me off. Why would I be upset with you? Do I scare you? They say you're very strict. With you, I'll never be very strict. Good. If only I knew how to please you... - Guess. - Is it that easy to guess? I'm not that bright. What would you be good at? Doing whatever I'm asked: run the estate, the mujiks. - It's OK that I'm young. - I can't forget about this dream. - Why does it worry you? - It's difficult... With you, I can be frank. - I have a nephew... - I know. You love him, you tell us about him. Our words can contradict our thoughts. Out of family duty, I say I love him. When you actually don't? No, it's not that I don't love him... but he's too much now. I'm so relaxed now. I've planned what I must do with the estate. And he might suddenly show up. How could I turn him down? I'd need to give him a share and deprive the one I love. - Don't give him anything. - Impossible! Why deny him his share if he's polite? And if he comes here, penniless, he'd need to be taken care of. He'll want to move in. - I couldn't turn him away. - Tell me to. I will. God forbid! Save yourself! Look. This was my dream: he gets carried away, he arrives... and he shoots you before my eyes. Me? That remains to be seen. Raisa Pavlovna, think about him no longer lest he be ever in your dreams. - True. One mustn't tempt fate. Okay, Arkadi. My aunt is a respectable lady. She can't know that I'm an actor. Or that I'm provincial. So careful, hold your tongue. I am Guennadi Gourmyjski, retired captain... Or major, whatever you like. In a word, I'm a gentleman, and you are my servant. - Your servant? - Yes. That's all. How should I introduce you to my aunt? She's a pious woman. With her, old boy, it's silence and decency. And suddenly, imagine, a look! With your mouth, you have to be a servant. - No, sorry. - What do you need now? You'll be fed and serve only me. - I have my pride. - I don't care. Martinov himself played servants, and he's much better than you. That was on a stage! Imagine that you're on a stage. No. I'd rather go. I still have ambition. Do it for me. Oh... As colleagues. Do you understand? If it's as colleagues, then maybe. Don't think I'm ashamed to be an actor. But for them, you and I are practically devils. Madam, last night a gentleman arrived. - What gentleman? - Mr. Guennadi, Madam's nephew. Hear that, Alexei? Where is he? I brought him to the cottage and prepared a room for him. He went into town and left all his bags there and came from town to the estate on foot to stretch his legs. - He didn't say anything? - No, Madam. He was in a very bad mood. How's that? The gentleman asked for a pen and paper. He paced a long while in the cottage, thinking. He sat down at the table and wrote a letter for me to give to you. "Oh, my awful fate! "How cruel it is! "All I see is the grave!" What's this? I don't understand. If you don't understand, how would I? - Is he asleep? - No, Madam. He got up early. He went to bathe. When he returns, invite him to take tea. Did you have a good night, sir? Yes, old boy. I took a nap and bathed. I say, sir, how you've aged! Life, old boy. I understand, sir. Service... Yes... "Service." And yet, sir, the country... "The country..." - From one place to the next. - Yes, indeed. - And how are you? - How are we living? We live in the forest. We still pray for our ancestors when we go to bed. Your aunt is expecting you for tea, sir. Listen, Karp. Don't forget my servant. - Serve him tea as well. - Of course, sir. Your name...? Sganarelle. What's that? A foreign name? - Yeah. And what's your name? - Karp Savalitch. - Do you want tea? - No. - Not at all? - No, not at all. - Why? - After bathing, a liqueur's best. Sure! But... - But where to drink it? - Make an effort! Bring it to us here in the cottage. OK. For you, I'll try. Yes, do try. I'm asking you to like me, sir. What's it to you if I like you? - What does it get you? - Well... It's the inheritance you want. Look. Flatter my auntie. She's a rich woman. Do you know how to? Yes. - Where did you learn? - What? To put on an act? To flatter, to grovel? Oh, necessity... taught me. - I've had bad luck. - I don't buy it. - What sort of bad luck? - My studies. - I didn't finish middle school. - No luck. Mom says I don't have a mind for schoolwork. - What type of mind do you have? - A practical one. Got any tobacco? No. I don't have that, either. Why are you laughing? Do you smoke or not? In front of Madam, never. - Guennadi! - Auntie! I never would have recognized you. - What an outfit! - It's for outdoors. Thank you for remembering me. How could I forget? You don't know my heart. I remember you. I know, my friend. Thank you for remembering. Nothing could make me happier than a rosary. When I sent it to you, I said: "Good woman, take them in your hands and pray." "Remember me in your holy prayers." Look at your dress! You're no longer in the service? No. Feeble health, feeble forces... and the enemy is no threat. Did you just change divisions? Yes. - Do you like your position? - My team suits me. I'm happy. The others are happy. - Are you on leave? - No. Just passing through. I wanted to rest. - Are you settled in? - Don't worry. The park, nature, solitude... it's paradise for my soul. You'll excuse me. I completely forgot you. That's OK. Is your nephew here? Yes, my nephew... Do you have it? We know what we're doing! - How much do you have? A lot? - Please. - What? - The document. - Our contract. - Oh, that's right. - I'm not sure where it is. - Look. I've probably lost it. You'd be doing me harm. I prepared a new one for you. May I take a look at it? Here. It's hard without glasses, with them it's worse. Read it, Piotr. "Sold this day to the shopkeeper Ivan Vosmibratov: "a forest in sections. Received all money due. "Landowner in Kalinov, Raisa Gourmyjskaïa." Very good, Madam. If Madam would like to count. 1,500, 1,600, 1,700... 1,800. If Madame would... How's that, 1,800? Pardon me, madam. My apologies. 200 rubles more. There. Now it's right. Is that it, Petrouchka? Speak, you big numbskull! Yes, that's right. Ivan Petrovitch, are you kidding me? We had said 3,000. 3, not 2. Does a forest like this go for 3,000? We don't want to lose, either. If that's how it is, then the sale is off. As Madam wishes. We beg your pardon. Piotr, let's go. Now think. You still have a bit of sense. I think so. If you don't agree to sell... I don't want... I'll keep the 1,500 for the burnt land, but... Take 500... Had you smiled, we would make a gesture. But Madam disdains our race and our condition. Come on. Let's go, Piotr. What? Even a child can understand this. I bought the forest from you. You gave me a receipt. I gave you money. So the forest is mine! And the money is yours. My respects. What is this? Theft in broad daylight? Alexei? Imagine that I sold the forest to Ivan Petrovitch for 3,000 and I received only 2. - What? It's my fault. The receipt said: "all money received." He gave me only 2,000. The devil! Has he left? - What will you do? - What do I know? - He has a receipt. - These are papers. I'm not a pencil pusher! - Come here! - Greetings, sir. I don't know your name. I don't want to talk to you. Perhaps you are hard of hearing, sir, so I'll come closer. Quick! My medals! How dare you? - What? I dared... - Quiet! A woman like this... What woman? He's asking me... A woman for whom everyone, me included, has the utmost admiration! Why are you yelling? I can yell, but what good would it do? Is he alive? I haven't killed him? What for? What do you want? What do I want? I want to tell you that you're a swindler. If you have something, speak. If not, farewell. How could you cheat a woman like her? Why do you believe your aunt? She is as gentle as an angel and he has an answer. Humility... Humility personified. No one can take that away from Madam. But her senses are impaired. And what good are her senses to you? Honor is forever. That's what you're missing. Say what you will, but not of my honor! I don't have honor? I have legal documents. That's my honor there! Ask and anyone will tell you. More, even. I can tell you: I am an honest man. As for the rest, I can't brag, but on the topic of honor, I am law personified. Go. - What? - Leave. Humanity... - Humanity! - Wait! Want me to kill you with one word? - Me? - Yes, you. - Do you see this? - What's "this"? Take it, as you see fit. I won't do anything. Take it. Give it to me yourself. That's the man I am. Your hand. My hand? If you push me, I'll go too far. Here is your money. I'm so appreciative, my friend. Do you know that I owe you exactly this sum? Well, your money... I'll take care of it. Oh, a woman's heart... You owe me! Perfect. One day, you'll give it to me, but for now, I don't need money. For now, I am rich. As you wish. I hope that you'll stay a bit longer. Noble woman, I will rest in the grave. It is paradise here. I don't deserve it. Thank you. He plays the fool but he has no money. He's leaving... He's a bit excited. Deep down, I think he's stupid. Did you have your dinner, Arkadi? Yes, I had my dinner. And did you eat well, brother? Very well. An intelligent man, Guennadi, always gets by. Who said that you were intelligent? Don't believe it. Very intelligent, in fact. First, I ate with the teachers - I said it was the custom - then I befriended the bursar, who I borrowed money from. I even have a bottle of liqueur. Not a bad start. Work, and play your role well. I play my role well. And you? I'm happy today, Arkadi. I did a good deed. Better to have the money... - What? - In the pocket! - Why give it to them? - It wasn't mine. You claim to be intelligent, but the schoolboy, more so. He's playing his role better than you. - What role? - The lead lover. - Whose lover? - Your auntie's. Your air isn't all that's servile. Your soul is, too. Hold your tongue, if not we'll fight. He's playing the lover, and you, the simpleton. - Me, "the simpleton"? - They take you for a dope. - Who? - Auntie and Boulanov. I heard them. They called you a moron. Go hang yourself so I can keep my hands clean. The money slipped away. If we're colleagues, then it's 50-50. I want my share. - Are you drunk? - I'm drunk and proud of it! Death to you! The trigger is broken! - Still alive? - What if we're seen? - Father and I spoke. - Tell me quickly. He said: "We won't find a dowry bride for you, moron. "If someone gave me 2,000, I would take it." But where to get it? - We'll have to. - Not from Raisa. No sense humiliating ourselves. Ask your older brother. - Guennadi. - I'm afraid to. How shameful! I'll need to tell him everything. There is mercy for all sins. And he seems like a kind man. Does shame even matter? When... "When" what? When death is coming? - What's wrong? - Everything seems empty here, Petia. - Everywhere... - Why? I can't say why. I'm not a scholar. But I feel emptiness. Since childhood, bad luck has gnawed at me. It's eaten around my heart. It's empty. And I'm still alone. Other people have a mother... a grandmother... a friend. But me, no one. I keep it all in, stored away. Cry? I don't cry. I don't have any tears. No pain is too great. But it's empty around my heart. And I think like this, I... Stop thinking. I can't stop. I lack the strength. I always see the water. What water? I take walks in the park... and I look longingly at the lake... It draws me near... the water behind the trees. - Stop. I'll run up to it and dive in. - That's a sin. - What you said to me stayed in my mind. It's not that I'm hopeless. Not at all. You see... we can live... we can hide, we can lie. No one will kill me if I go back. What kind of life is that? A dog has a life! We can hope for better, no? Living like this isn't worth it. I'm not 16 anymore. See, my dear, all the hardship that I endure for you. Ask your older brother. Maybe he'll save us. Go. It's already time. - And you, Aksioucha, go back. - Don't be afraid. God be with you. I'm putting my hope in you. Have you tasted the liqueur? I don't know if it's any good. It's very good. Great! You make it, no? It sounds like you're joking around. Should I bring you cream tomorrow? With pleasure. Cream from a mad cow. - I don't understand. - Rum! That's how we call it. I'll try. Try... if you love me. - Did you say, "If you love me?" - Yes. So? - Know what I say to that? - No. You say that to mock me, but it's not nice to judge. I'm happy about everything. Men are happy because they don't have to answer. But take note: you can't marry or love someone, it's not allowed. Only one thing to do: flatter Madam, grovel before her. By dint of groveling, you get slight gratification, and then, your heart lets go, because the heart is alive. It needs to live. - Humanity... - Is that your master? He'll thrash me. Humanity! How ignoble men can be... - Is he gone? - To death. Yes, he's gone. But he cast a wild look. How do you live with a master like that? He's not my master. I'm his equal. He was born a master. That can't be taken away. He and I are equals. We're actors. He's "Infortunatov." I'm "Fortunatov." Two drunks! "Actors?" What? We've been wandering from theater to theater for over 10 years, like Gypsies. That's why he never came back. He was ashamed to be seen. - How awful! - And now he goes on foot. He couldn't be seen without a servant. So he begged me. And in the country, I fare better than he does. Crybabies are passé. What are you saying? He hopes to take advantage of auntie. If he asked for charity directly... No, he's too ashamed! Jesus and Mary! Excuse me! To hell with your estate! I'm getting far away from you. Except I'm scared. There are dogs in town. They have nothing to eat! Brother? Brother? Brother? A woman. A splendid woman. Are you a woman or a ghost? Brother, what's wrong with you? I see that you're a woman. I wished, on this splendid evening, to speak with those from the hereafter. They've taken only secrets and suffering to the grave! Yes... I am the dark. The living don't matter! I've suffered greatly and I'm suffering, too. You? I am so unhappy. If you are unhappy, come to me, rest on my chest. Brother, I'm guilty. - Not to me. - I am to everyone. And to me, I am. I love. My sweet child... love whom you want. God gave us a heart so we could love. I love... I'm going mad. But I absolutely need to marry him. - Who's stopping you? - People. Don't listen to them. Marry the one you want. But he won't get married without a dowry. His father forbids it. We need a dowry. And I don't have one. Joy is dearer than money. Without money, I'll have no joy. - Do you need a lot of money? - 2,000. God almighty... And the happiness of a young soul depends on this? It weighs on me terribly to speak to you of it... I'm asking only you. You are rich... alone. Give me life! Be quiet. I'm a criminal. I could've had money, but I spent it all on debauchery. - Brother... - I've made no headway from my youth, in my life... - No. If I had known... We drink, we yell, we embody false passions. We boast about tavern heroism! Another lie for my heart. Poor sister, between life and death... Cry, you filthy drunk! Cry! Why did I humiliate myself? I'm an idiot for having hope! There is no hope for me. Farewell. Aksioucha! My child... Though your misery be profound, I won't let you die. You must live. I feel nothing. I am dead. You know everything about storms. Everything about passions. There's nothing left for me. Here... who'll appreciate the diamonds that are your tears? If you gave half of these gifts to an audience, the theater would crumble from the cheers. They would throw flowers at you. Here, your sobs get no answer. There, for a single one of your tears, a million eyes would cry. Little sister, I am a beggar. But on stage, I am a prince. I am Hamlet. I live his life, I feed on his thoughts. I cry his tears for poor Ophelia. On stage, you will seem like a queen. You will go out... like a queen. Do what you wish. I'm ready for anything. You will be my pride... my glory. I will be your father. Follow me. I have scripts at home. I'll read them to you. Tonight, I dub thee... actress. - Did you speak to him? - Yes, I did. I told him: "Madam is not asleep. She's in the park. "Perhaps she's bored being alone. "And you're lounging. What are you doing?" He jumped right up. And got dressed! That's good! Madam, I don't know how to say it... Speak. What is it? Miss has gone. I don't know where. She's not in her room. The bed is still made. Perfect. What? I've had enough. I didn't know how to get rid of her. Now I can. There's something else that I learned. But it's scary. You scare me and then you tell me something trivial. Madam, it's about Guennadi. What is it? He's not a gentleman. He's an actor. He's desecrated his family name. He's called "Infortunatov." And he's more interested in drinking than the theater. The clothes you saw are all he has. Even better. His servant is an actor, too. Except that he's the more dishonest. They'll have cleared out by tomorrow. This is not a hotel. You speak the truth, Madam. - It's me, Alexei. - Yes. Why didn't you call for me earlier? I didn't know you liked the night... I like nature. If you're bored... Nights like these don't bore you? What I don't know is what you want. My friend... You definitely want to play. I'd give anything to know what you love. What I love? I'm curious to hear what you say. The moon. I used to, but it's been over for a long time. Family? "Family..." How sweet. Family... Speak! - I order you. - I don't know. Imbecile! I thought so but... May I help you? Listen, Aksioucha. You live here and you think that it can be like this forever. I'm responsible for you. There was a time when I wanted you to marry Alexei but you're not thinking about it. - I'm not. You don't deserve that man. Why so quiet? I'm listening. Perhaps he courted you, perhaps you flirted with him. Absolutely not. Whether you liked it or not is not my business. He doesn't like you. - Good. - He likes someone else. - You need to leave my house. - When would suit you? Where will you go? - Are you going to move to town? - Maybe. That's impossible. That's very close. My dear, Alexei is not a serious boy... Do it for me. Go farther away. I'm going far away. Very far. Go, and may God grant you happiness. Hello. - Hello. - Mr. Infortunatov. - You know that I'm Infortunatov? - Oh, I know. Happy to hear it, old boy. So you know who I am? A small-town actor. So you don't know. Too bad. I should put a bullet in your skull! Strength had value in the old days. What do you want me to do? Shoot you? No! I prefer natural methods. How can I be useful? It's teatime in my aunt's house. - Excuse... - Excuse you why? Raisa Pavlovna cannot see you. She's unavailable. She wants me out? Why? She has asked that you leave her. Why does it matter that I'm an actor? I'm not a bandit. I earn my living with honest work. I didn't come to ask her for charity. This is offensive. Fine. I'll tell her. - Anything else? - No. Goodbye. Now he'll never set foot here again. Oh, you have a way! You have a style. Still, I'm a bit mad at you for yesterday. Excuse me, Raisa, but I was so happy. You're excused. You need to always respect a woman's delicate nature. I'm still a kid, but your love and experience will help me. My friend... you are still so young. - What an outfit! - It's for traveling. - I came to say my goodbyes. - Goodbye. - Just a word before I go. - I'm listening. We don't need a witness. Especially not Boulanov, if you value his miserable life. Please my friend, could you pass me that money box? Don't worry. It's fine there. - I'll get it. - Don't trouble yourself. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Do you know what? Give it to me. - No, no. - As a souvenir. There are important papers in it... You're wrong. It's money. All right: there was a small-town actor. A woman offended him. A director's wife. He said nothing, but he never forgot about the offense. Then, at the producer's, there was a cast party. - Put the gun away. - Listen, Auntie. Listen. Towards the end of the party, he approached the woman: "Your hand, please." She gave it to him. And then, her finger, he bit it off! Why do you tell me this? Obviously, he was very stupid. I know him, he's an imbecile. The tragedian Infortunatov won't let himself be toyed with. First, the tragedian Infortunatov needs money for the journey. He could not leave his aunt's place on foot. Next, there's a poor young girl who lives with you. What if, due to your deeds, she drowned herself? I'm bringing her, so she'll need something. Last, as we refuse a share in the inheritance, which is easy, as you're leaving us nothing, for this, too, we're owed something. Listen, don't torment me. Tell me how much you need. I'm forgiving. You decide. I'll give you 1,000 rubles. Here's your money. Thank you. Please, put the gun away. I feel sick. Why so afraid? I might have killed the schoolboy, but you? Not for anything. I came as a gentleman, and I'm leaving as a gentleman. Karp! Money? I've got plenty! You and I will head for the Volga in a troika. And then a steamer! In first class! Wonderful, wonderful... I could get used to it... Like a wedding reception! I'll be your best man. I was born for this. What's poverty? Anybody can be poor. It takes skill to spend money with style! On foot, you despise yourself. I don't know about you, I hate this life. I'm all for the rich! A man drinks champagne, smokes good cigars. The rest is unimportant! - It's you! - Not so loud. It's over. My brother has no money. I'm leaving with him, forever. Goodbye. Go. You're leaving? To go where? To the theater. To be an actress! - Are you crazy? Wake up! - It's decided! Go. I have a hole in my heart. Like a stone shot into my chest. I spoke to my dad. - And? - He dressed me down and said: "If I had 1,000 rubles for you..." When I say my goodbyes, I'll talk to my aunt about it, but there's little hope. I'm sorry. Don't return to say goodbye. Just follow me with your eyes. Now I would gladly throw myself into deep, dark water. I've got them! Brother... ask my aunt. Perhaps she'll take pity on me. We now need only 1,000. 1000 rubles! But being an actress with your feeling... My "feeling", I need it for our home. She has teetered. Gentlemen, I've called you here to countersign my will, but circumstances have changed a bit. I'm getting married. - May I introduce my future husband? - Excellent. Please sit down. Alexei. - Sit down. - Allow me to stand. Gentlemen, I have no excuse, my estate is in ruins. I was going to entrust it to my nephew... but he has stunned me! Do you know what career he's chosen? He's a small-town actor. Terrible... And your niece? I'm very unhappy with her conduct. I've decided to make a sacrifice. I'm marrying to save the estate. That's heroic of you. I needed to find a man. And what a man! If you only knew! Careful, Raisa Pavlovna. Keep an eye on him. He's so young. He made a pledge. - An amazing pledge. - You'll see flowers on this estate. I may be young, but I'll be an ardent champion of our interests and privileges. Best wishes to you, Auntie! Getting married? Yes, my friend. The time is right. For my part, I'm very happy and I approve of your union. Why aren't you coming in? Auntie, I'd like to introduce my friend, Arkadi Fortunatov. A pleasure. - Is this your nephew? - It's an honor. Guennadi. Good news, Madam! All the best! Auntie, you're indescribably happy. Oh, yes, I'm happy. A happy man becomes a better man, more noble. Auntie, you have a niece, a sweet and humble girl. She also has a fiancé. While he is neither as handsome nor daring as yours, she loves him. And here is the fiancé's father. I know, my friend. Gentlemen, he's a respectable Russian but boorish deep down. He loves his children and wants to see them marry, but he wants a dowry of 1,000 rubles. Oh, no! I've had considerable expenses and other large ones to come. We can't spend a cent. I want to open a stud farm. The ponds must be scraped out. You won't give them anything? I'm sorry, my friend. I can't. Auntie... I'm blushing for you. She and I are your only family. She won't ask for anything more. I don't need a dowry. You're rich. What does such a thing mean to you? If I had the money... What's this? I have it. - Here it is. - Huh? Be quiet. A rich woman may refuse to give a poor girl a dowry, but a poor artist will not. Come here, child. - And the steamship? - Brother! That's enough. I'll be damned if I cry. That's shameful! - How to thank you? - Just say "thank you." We are very grateful. - Who's he? - The actor. The actor! Bravo! Your hand! I heard that. Someone who speaks noble words well! It's rare here. Is he an actor, too? Yes, indeed. - He doesn't talk? - No, he talks. - What does he say? - I call like the starling. I jump like the magpie. Bravo. Stop to see me. You'll be most welcome. He needs to be shown the door. He could do anything. I believe you were going. I intend to, yes. Isn't it about time? Arkadi... they're getting rid of us. Why did we come to this wild, dark forest? Why did we frighten the owls? Let them live as they see fit. Actor? Actor? No. We are artists. You are the actors. When we love... we love. When we don't, we argue or fight. When we help, we help with our last cent. But all your life, you've quibbled about the love of your fellow man. So what have you done? Who have you fed or consoled? All you do is play-act for your own amusement. You're the buffoons. Not us. Humanity... Humanity! Pack of crocodiles... - Your tears are water. - Your tears are water. Your hearts, tempered steel. Lions and leopards feed their young, crows take care of their young. But her... Her! Is this how love answers love? Oh, if only I were a hyena! If only I could assemble all the other carnivores of the forest in this hell! You'll answer for this! - We're all witnesses. - Me? Wrong! Targeted by censure! Look! Permitted representation. I'm leaving... like a gentleman. You're a pencil pusher's underling! Come on. We're off, Arkadi. Auntie, your hand. Oh, no! No, no... I won't bite. Don't be afraid. - Obviously, he won't bite. - You don't know that. Humanity... Humanity... There. We celebrated. We yelled, we acted. We're off! Your hand, my friend. Subtitles: Eclair Group
