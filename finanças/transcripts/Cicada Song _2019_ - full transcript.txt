Any family she might have went to visit? - I don't think so. It's not like her to just take off like this. - Okay, just so you understand, a missing adult is not a crime. - Um, her ex, Richard Butler... - Okay. - Very hostile. He was very aggressive toward both of us. And Bob Wilkes, he threatened me, he told me to learn respect and he told Annabelle that she needed to mind her own business. - And that was a threat? - It felt like a threat. - Okay, I'll talk to him. In the meantime, if she contacts you, if you hear anything, let me now as soon as you can. - Thanks, Dan.

A lot. - I never intended for this to happen. - Rich, I get it, you were hurt. - I can fix it. - Fix what? - I can, I can fix it. - What is this? - It's a promise I made to the wrong people. I need you to understand it that I didn't know. - Know what? - They promised me money to help me get out of debt. - Who? Who promised you money? - If I tell you, you can't tell anybody that I told you. You need... you need to promise me. - I promise. Wilkes. - You said they. Who else? - Rafferty. Jones. Hudson. There were more, I don't know who. - Why? - Job Brennan, they run him off his land. They just took it. - I don't understand. - There's so much money out there, it just depends how much you're willing to do to get it. - Oh my God. - No, no. No, no... I didn't take Annabelle. You know I would never hurt her. - Do you know who did? You tell me! - I don't know, they cut me out. - Did you take Mariposa? - I never thought it was gonna get this bad. - You! Richard, we have to go to the police. You have to tell them. - No! If I go to the police, I'm a dead man. I'm already a dead man. - None of this had to happen! Why would you wait until now to say something! - Nobody I cared about disappeared. - Oh shit. - Karen? - Hey Tom, Annabelle told me she spoke with you. - I don't think you should be here right now. Pop is mad as shit. - She said there was a little boy that went missing from one of your migrant workers last year? - I don't want any trouble Bob, I just have a few questions. - Go inside. You need to get off my land. - I know about Farmsure and what you did to Job Brennan. - You don't know nothin'. Now, out a respect for your old man, I'm gonna give you to the count a 10. One. - Two. Three. - Hello. - Hey, I need you to come to the house. - Yeah, I'm in the middle of something, can it wait? - I'm afraid not. - I'll be there shortly. Shit! - Don't you look nice. - Thanks. - What's the occasion? - We got another meeting in the Ozarks today, hopefully this ones for real. If we don't get going, we are going to be late. - You still haven't heard from Annabelle? - No... - I feel like I'm barely holding it together. - I got a call from Bob Wilkes. Seems you went by his house? Karen, I thought we settled this. - We settled his payment to the farm. - Why are you pushing him? - Do you know anything about a company called Farmsure? - No, why? - They bought Job Brennan's land. - What does this have to do with Bob? - Bob is a member. He approached Richard, did he approach you? - No, he didn't. - You swear? - Come on, Karen. How long have you known him? Your entire life. For Christ sakes, he was best friends with your daddy. Richard, on the other hand, that boy's got problems. Why is Bob so important in all this? - A little boy went missing from one of his farm workers about a year ago. - That's terrible. Who told you that? - Tom Wilkes told Annabelle. Richard confirmed it. I think Bob knows what happened to Annabelle, but I can't get him to tell me. - Karen. - He pulled a shotgun on me. And there are others, Jones, Rafferty, Hudson, some guy named Hugh Neibaum. We have to do something! - Calm down. We're not involved. - Involved, with what? - I'll tell you on the way. - Great, we gotta go. - I'm waitin' on you. Give me a second. I'll be out in a second. Let's talk about this when I get back. I'll call you later, okay? - Hello? Help me. Please! - Welcome. - William? - Ah, please, call me Bill. - I was referred to you by a friend. - Ah, always nice to hear. Ah, and you are? - Joanne Larson. - Ah, and how can I be of service to you? - Well, you sold some land, Job Brennan's old place, to a Doug and Wendy Schultz. - Ah, I don't recollect the name. We sell hundreds of properties each year. - Have you ever heard of Farmsure? - Doesn't ring a bell. - How about the name Bob Wilkes? - I'm a busy man, Ms. Larson. Now, if you don't mind, could you kindly? - My apologies, I'm sorry to have bothered you. - Neibaum, Neibaum and Feenie, how may I direct your call? - Hugh Neibaum, please. - Who may I say is calling? - Joanne Larson. Are you a client? - No, I was referred to Mr. Neibaum by a friend. - Please hold. - This is Hugh Neibaum. - Hi, Mr. Neibaum, I am looking to get into one of your LLCs. - LLCs? And what might those LLCs be? - Farmsure or maybe Future Bright? - Who recommended you? - A friend. - Can you give me a name? - Bill Samson. - What did you say your name was? - Joanne Larson. - Karen, I suggest you leave this alone and get on with your life. - Whatever it is you're looking for, I assure you, you will find nothing. So, I'll ask you kindly to cease and desist. Have a nice day. - Dad, please. - What do you want? - I need your help. - Why? - Can I come in? - Fine. - If I could only call the folks. They're going to be so worried about us. - Everything will be all right. As soon as we get to Willard, we'll call them. They might even be there. - I know. - Tom? - Dad. - Don't you call me that. Make it quick. Um... - Annabelle. - Who? - Annabelle... my- my friend. She's missing. I talked to the sheriff. - So, what do you need me for? - I think Bob Wilkes is kidnapping children for money. - And? - Dad, I just wanted to know if you might know something about, did he come to you about a business that might help subsidize the farm? - No. He never cam to me about anything. - Did anyone come to you? Jones, Rafferty, Hudson. - No. Is that all? - Did a lawyer come to you? Neibaum? Please, I have no one else to turn to. - You should have thought of that before. - Before what? - Before you betrayed your mother. Me. God. - Okay, I'm sorry I betrayed you. - It wasn't Wilkes. - Who was it? - Richard? Have you seen Richard? - Not since you left with him last night. I bet it wasn't as good as you thought it would be. Never is. - ¿Señorita? Señorita. - Oh, you liar. - Rafferty. - Wilkes. - Jones. - Hudson. - Forad. - Gracias. - Oh... - Where are they? - I don't know. We just supply them. - They're children. - They don't belong here. - I know why. - Oh- - What are you doing? - Shut up. - Kurt. - Do you have any idea what position you put us in? - Where's Annabelle? - She's around here somewhere.
