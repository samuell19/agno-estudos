The patient is 45 years old. Fell down the stairs suddenly. No respiration and pulse since I arrived. Let's lift him, one, two, three. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Good, I'll check his pulse. It's vpb. No pulse. Have DC ready, and 1ml of epinephrine. Yes, doc. Contact cardiac unit, did you contact his family? I'll do that now. Charge 150. - Administering epinephrine. - Step back. Charging. Stay clear, incoming shock. One, two, three, shock! "Missing child Kim yoon-su" You slept in the car again? I prefer my car. It's miserable sleeping in a motel. You'll ruin your body. You're not young, at least sleep properly. I sleep and eat well. No need to worry about me. Where were you this time? Goseong. You were there before. How about going back to work? We can look for him on the weekends together. Air there was incredible. The land is cheap, too. We should move there and farm with our boy. And you've farmed before? There's nothing I can't do, so long as we find our boy. Isn't that seung-hyun? That's him. - Seung-hyun! - Morning! Hello! Good to see you. Good morning, ma'am. They're yoon-su's parents. Hello, I'm yoon-su's mom. And I'm yoon-su's dad. Jin-wook! Hi, nice to meet you. Let's shake hands. I have a son like you. But I lost him. You can be friends with yoon-su. He's 12 now. Jin-wook is 10, your boy's older. I never thought he'd be in a mental hospital. Seung-hyun barely got me in. The police sent him to the hospital. He said he told them his name. Had they searched his name just once. And at the hospital? They had no reason to help, too busy hiding him. One extra body means more funding. He came back after 4 years. He could've come home much early if someone... Had taken some interest in him... He ran to me and shouted "mom" and I lost it... He was still alive... Jin-wook. Could I get a kiss too? Mom? I'm hungry. Honey. Honey? Look at you. You were out of it. You're home early, did you have dinner? Not yet. Should we order something? No, you always eat take outs. I'll fix you something. Do you want anything? Got any eggs? Probably. How about kimchi soup with fried eggs? What is it? We're out of rice. That's great. Let's just order noodles. No, I'll be right back. Wait, jung-yeon. It's okay. When it got so hard, raising yoon-su, I wanted him gone for a week, so I could be alone. I had that thought once. It feels like I abandoned him. Because of me... I hate myself for that. You were very tired at the time. Can we ever go back? When he comes back, can we go back to normal? Yes. We can all go back. And we will. "Help find song hye-hee" "missing child association" hi, hi! What brings you here so early? For this and that. I'm glad you came. Your parents? My birth parents and foster parents. I wondered who you took after, they look striking. Would you like some tea? I'll have some later. I hope they're all doing well. Just like you. Yes, probably. I tracked all my movements while looking for yoon-su. You're the expert, I wanted to get your help. Please... Take good care of my son. I will. And that thing... - The teaching position... - Yes? Is that still available? For sure, I got a call recently about it too. I owe him big time. Ketamine, be extra careful with this one. It can paralyze even the breathing muscles. Don't administer this without a respirator. Okay. By the way, you're incredibly cool. Pardon? You're cool. How so? I just thought you look like a real pro. Always so bright, and healthier than normal people. Normal people? What I meant was... Healthier than those who didn't lose their kid? I'm so sorry. Don't be, it's the truth. Head out first, I'm gonna take a break. Okay. "Yoon-su is selling bread at sanjung rest stop." Good day, sir. Good to meet you. - I'm Kim myeong-guk. - Kim byung-su. Not too hard finding this place? Absolutely, it was easy. - Good, please sit. - Thank you. Seung-hyun told me a lot about you. I see. So you taught for a long time? Yes, just over 10 years. 10 years... You fit the bill as a gym teacher. Me? Really? - Very handsome too. - Thank you. - Charismatic, I bet. - Not at all. A charismatic math teacher, huh? Students will go crazy. Come on... They won't. This business changes so fast, it'll be hard catching up in the beginning. Yes, I got a lot of homework to do. Math is all based on formulae. There is such a thing as trend though. Of course. They're all good kids, get high grades too. You won't have a hard time teaching them. I see. It's a pleasure to have you with us. No, the pleasure is all mine. Let's see, when can you start? In 100 meters, turn left. "Bread shop's closing, you coming?" "Yo, sucker!" "Coming fo' sho? Lol" What about your poor wife? You didn't find yoon-su yet... Jung-yeon, this is all wrong! You're drunk already? This is all wrong! Get up, we have guests! In-sook, everything's wrong about this! Jung-yeon, I'll find yoon-su! Min-su! Slacking off, eh? I'm so tired of doing all the fucking work by myself. Huh? I'm kidding. Go easy on him, alright? Stupid ass. Look at him struggle. Take this. Come up. We got a righteous man in town. He reminds you of your bookworm son? Lift your head. A high school teacher's son went missing 6 years ago. He roamed the entire country for his son and died in a tragic car accident. The catalyst for the accident was a prank text. I was just bored. I didn't think he'd come. Those punks should've been brought to our station. I'd have beaten them. This isn't their fault though. It's their parents' fault. "Missing child Kim yoon-su" look, that's his photo. He looks like mansun fishing spot's helper boy? Mansun fishing spot? Yeah, you know... The nice looking boy, who seems a bit slow. What was his name? Min-su? Yeah, min-su, min-s... - That's him... - Min-su? Yes, he looks so similar to min-s... No way, kids his age all look similar. Looks so similar, take a look. You rascal! He looks exactly like him in this photo. Forget the kid and go on a patrol, you idiot. So similar... Bang! Have you ever gone hunting? - Hunting? - Yeah. Caught a few back in the day with a trap. Not like that, I meant shooting real animals in the wild. Nope. You haven't got a taste yet. It feels so good, it's exhilarating, damn! - Seriously? - You bugger. I'm gonna go hunting later, do you want to come? Nah, I suck at it. Whatever. "On the way..." "Just like that..." Look at his eyelashes, there really is a resemblance. Could he be him? No way, his skin tone is light. Come on, this photo is from 6 years ago. People change, skin tone changes too. Can you lift your head? Are you deaf? Lift your head. Stop it! Don't hit him. He doesn't hear very well. He doesn't? Why not? About 2 or 3 months ago, Mr. kang gave him a real good beating, and pus came out of his ear! What did he do to get the beating? He doesn't hear so well after that! Stop it! You guys are nuts. Take a look. You draw really well. With your drawing, he does look like the boy. Burn Mark? You're yoon-su, right? He said he did it to himself while burning trash. Even so, they're too similar. Take a look. Will you stop that? It's so uncanny. By the way, how did he end up here? Well... Remember Mrs. Kim from the island? She left him with us because no one could look after him. Mrs. Kim? When was this? Can you reach her? What? She's dead, 6 or 7 years ago. What if that woman took in this couple's child? It's possible. You dumb-ass idiot. Think logically for once. Why'd these people abduct a deaf child? He's useless. He works. Drop it! Whose kid is ji-ho by the way? Now you're gonna investigate who I fucked? A widow can't have a kid? Sgt. Hong. Did you two team up for this? If you're short on cash, just say so. Sir. Did I ever take your money? What's with everyone today? She's dead. Mrs. Kim or whatever, she's dead, that's it! Apologize to everyone, asshole. I'm sorry about that. Forget it. I won't sit here and get labeled as a kidnapper. You're all driving me insane! Boy! Get up! Come here! Just go! Come here. Come here! Okay, fine, go! Sir, over here. He looks so similar. Officer Kim, how long have you been posted here? So what then? What will you do then? Are you so desperate to give it all up? Give what up? Dumbass. Didn't you take money from these people? Shut your mouth and forget it. Don't do anything. Not another word. What's this? Don't want it? Everything costs money with a newborn. My arm's tired! I shouldn't... You're a piece of work. "Missing child" "Ketamine" jung-yeon! It's me! Open the door! Jung-yeon, have some, you have to power through it. You eat some too. Stop it, I can eat it myself. That's enough. Be nice while I'm still around. How is it? Isn't the food here great? Yeah, it's fine. Excuse me. When will you ask her? We're not begging for money, it's a loan to educate our kid! Stop it! She's got no one else anyway. She has to think of her nephew as her own now. That's why your brother left her his life insurance. Give me a sec, please, let me think about it! You'll die of old age when you're done thinking. I better eat and wise up. "Restricted caller ID" - answer it. - It's not mine. - Answer it! - It's not my call! Just do it! Yes, hello? This is Mrs. suh jung-yeon's phone. Yes, that's correct. I checked the burn Mark myself. I don't have any photos... He has a birthmark behind his ear. A burn Mark on his back. Maybe it's a bruise. Not sure, but it's like a birthmark that kids have. It looks like that. Like the description on the flyer, there is a burn Mark. Where are you exactly? Ever heard of naebu island near musan? Yes. Look for a boy named min-su at mansun fishing spot. Thank you. If you give me your number, I'll reward you for the tip. No, I just wanted to help 'cause I'm a father too. Just take the boy away quietly. Okay, good night. "Kim yoon-su" he left me with this that morning. He asked me to print more flyers, and I can get them in 2 days. It was a playground for me too. I was too young to remember, but they say I got lost at a playground. I was afraid it'd happen again, so I always smiled. Then I met my foster parents. At the time, I felt... Remorse? I wanted to meet the parents who abandoned me, so that I could tell them, that I grew up fine without them. I thought that was my only form of revenge. After I got into college, I made a resolution. I wanted to seek them out. So during that summer break, I came to Korea. I went to various orphanages. Then I received a call. She said she was my aunt. What took you so long? Your mom and dad looked everywhere for you, why come now? What took you so long?! They abandoned me, but I was late? I was utterly confused. Sis! Seung-hyun's back! Your son seung-hyun came back! Sis! I thought they threw me away, but there they were. My mom committed suicide, and dad was in shock and died of cancer. I got there too late. "I miss you so much, my baby" That's why you can't give up. Yoon-su will come back to you. Why is min-su being so weak? I know, he's being weasely lately. Work keeps piling up. Get off. Afternoon, sir. I heard there'll be a wind storm over the weekend. I was hoping to do gangbusters, but I'll be sucking on my thumb. Don't be a baby, I heard you got a group today. You got a group? Yes, sir, but it ain't much. It's all thanks to our great co-op president. Come on now, I didn't do anything. Oh yeah, here. - What is it? - Ginseng. I wanted to borrow a hand. A hand? Whose? Could I borrow min-su? Min-su? He's got a ton of work here today. He's gotta fix stuff at the mud flat center too. We all gotta help each other. I'll send him over after he finishes doing that. Hello. You made some money, huh? Got the insurance too. Spend some, about $50,000. How can I trust you? What? How can I trust you and pay you? Send me an advance, and pay me the rest after you find him. How can I trust you?! Yoon-su has an allergy, right? Peach allergy. A small mole behind his ear. He got the burn Mark on a trip. He has cracked toenail. Split toenail, right? Please take your cash. Mrs. suh jung-yeon? Where's yoon-su? "Reward agreement" I was told to get something from you. "Mansun fishing in naebu island, look for min-su" "Mansun fishing spot" There's the kill. This thing jams so much. Are you the mommy, bitch? Bring them over! What are you waiting for? Help ji-ho. Excuse me? Did you pay admission? I came to look for a child. My son, yoon-su. I heard he's called min-su here. Where is he? Who? Sgt. Hong, let's take a short break. Why not. Let's have a smoke. Ji-ho, move aside. Sit up straight. Sit up. Mr. choi, you're a kind man. Aren't you? Your boy's around min-su's age, right? Yes. Mine's similar age too. I heard he's a good student? Yes. You must be so proud he's doing well with his grandma. I sent my boy abroad with my wife, and not a single peep from them. They just want me to send them money. I think he has slight fever. Are you alright? I can strip him, that'll cool him down. Is it fun playing with kids at your age? They're so nice and tender, so much fun. Dumbass. What is it? Some woman from Seoul came to find her son. Son? Who's that? How would I know? She's here with that flyer officer Kim showed us. She even knew min-su's name. Min-su? That son of a bitch. Could min-su be that missing kid? You said Mrs. Kim brought him, her grandson! He is, but officer Kim said... Are there any customers who saw min-su today? Most of them who saw him are gone now, why? Most of them? Yeah. Okay. Hurry back! I said okay. What if someone says they saw min-su? No one gets in other people's business nowadays. It's a nuisance, so they'll look the other way. That'd be fortunate. Could min-su be her child? No, no way. We kept him for a few years, he can't be hers. Life is like that. Tell everyone to keep their mouths shut. Okay. Hello, this is my boy, please take a look... What's up? Hey, that's a private land. Would you like it if someone peeked into your home? Stay out of there. Come on! Is min-su's mom really here? The reward money was damn big. Should I get the money and take off? It's better than letting Hong bastard take our shit. He has me working like a mule every damn day. It's fucked, I'd rather just get the reward, and go work for someone else, isn't that better? All I do here... I heard a ball rolling, it was you? What do you mean? I don't look like a ball... Then maybe it was a rock. Sure, a rock's better. I should've brought a sledgehammer then. A rock never moves. Here! I treated a sub-human like a man, how dare you? This is why they say you shouldn't trust people. Isn't that right, Mr. choi? Uncanny... Why does he look familiar only to me? Have you ever seen it? Wasn't it on the news? Your husband got into an accident due to a prank. Yes. An accident? What's that about? He got a prank text from kids and got into a car accident, then died on the way. You poor thing, you must be devastated. You searched all these places? Yes. You're ji-ho, right? Have you seen him? If we don't know, how would he? He doesn't know! Would you like a drink? It'll make you feel better. She needs to drive back home. Did you drive here? Will you head back to Seoul tonight? No, I'm gonna leave tomorrow. I see. You came a long way, you should rest up tonight. The night drive is terrible. - Mr. choi. - Yes? Call Mr. hwang and get her a motel room. The best one. Certainly. Try this one. The baby is so nice and tender. We shot a pregnant deer and got a baby for free. Let me see. You must be tired. Yoon-su had split toenail just like you. It's like a message from him. "Don't forget me," "don't give up on me," just like that. My boy, min-su, did you miss me? I missed you so damn much. "Wanted for rape and murder" "Missing person: Kim yoon-su reward: $20,000" What are you doing? What are you doing in someone else's home? What brings you here at this hour? I found this here. Isn't that your flyer? So what? You know that I'm a cop, right? Maybe the fishermen left it. What about these clothes? Those are my boy's. He comes by on weekends from time to time. These are clothes of a boy who comes to visit? These raggedy clothes? There's a boy's shoes inside the house. And ji-ho's locked up. Wait a minute. What did you say? You really are clueless. You're saying you broke into someone's home? Enough, please leave. "Mansun fishing spot" back again? What? What is it now? I came to say good bye. What is it? Why is she here? She came to say good bye. Have a safe drive up. Wish you luck in your search. Come by when you find him. I'll make him something good. See you. Ji-ho. Could you give me a hug? Give her a hug. Be good to your mom and always be healthy. She's not my mom. Ji-ho, she has to go. Come back. Right now! So you like pretty chicks too? She lives in the city, we have it rough in the country. Here comes sgt. Hong. Good afternoon. Are you leaving? We got your call yesterday. What call? You made a report. What do you mean? It's nothing. I guess we made a bad impression on her. How is that nothing?! She took us for kidnappers! Wait, is this true? Is this all true?! Enough, that's fine. Don't worry about things here. I'll make sure to drill my colleagues. It's a long drive back, you better go. Off you go. "Lost dog" "Missing person: Kim yoon-su reward: $20,000" Holy cow... What? Did I startle you? You sure did, sir. Good. You deserve a proper beating. Beating? Did I do something? Look at that acting. You deserve an academy award. Asshole, yoon-su's mom came by last night. Yoon-su's... you mean min-su's mom? Not min-su, yoon-su's mom! So it wasn't him... What? How could he be?! She checked min-su herself. You made a big mess for her and me too. At least now I know how you really think about me. I got it. I'm sorry, sir. No need to apologize. - But sergeant... - Don't touch me. Live however you want, asshole. So it wasn't him. "Kim yoon-su" buddy. You chicken shit. Move it. Min-su, your mom was here. Strong winds and waves are expected this weekend. What was that? What? The wind, probably. I'm sure I locked it up. It's too late for a call. What is it, Mr. Lee? Are the kids not inside? Mr. Lee said he saw them by the quay. They're not here. What do you mean? Goddamn kids! Shit! You saw the kids? Yes. I came out for some fresh air and saw them. They were holding a flyer. Flyer? These kids really are after trouble. Where did they go? Those little buggers were all over the place, they took off this way. Mr. hwang came from there, so they'll be here somewhere. Let's see, I bet they're watching us from nearby. Min-su, let's go home! Just wait till I get my hands on you. Goddamn shit! Min-su. Min-su! Fucking bitches! You just wait... Perfect timing. - Grab him, get him. - Stay right there, don't move. - Don't you dare. - Don't move. You know better than to fight back, kid. - Don't move. - It's up to you, whether we find your mom or not. This little bastard's brave. Yoon-su! Who's that? - What's with her? - What's she doing? Hey! Stop! - Go get him! - Yoon-su! Goddammit, what happened? Get back here! Get him! Get over here! Hey! Where are you going?! Stop! Yoon-su! Yoon-su! Get back here! Stop right there! Grab him! Min-su! Don't go any further! Get back here! You idiot! Get over here! Come out of there! Where do you think you're going?! No! It's dangerous! Look how nervous he looks! You wanna die, boy?! That's the end of sea wall! Calm down! No... Yoon-su! It's mom! I'm sorry for coming so late! Yoon-su, let's go home! It's mom! Baby, it's gonna be all right. I'm right here. I'm here, it's all right. It's okay, baby. I'm here, my boy. Are you okay? I'm right here, it's okay. My boy. Let's go see dad. Let's go home, yoon-su. Yoon-su... Mom? You're up? Let's eat. Get yoon-su. Yoon-su! I'm cold, mom. - Yoon-su... - Please... Find me. Yes, yoon-su, I will. Son, I'll find you. You're up already? How do you feel? Where's my boy, yoon-su? Oh my, she went nuts. I was told he was here. Snap out of it! Is she putting on a show? You know, right? You know where yoon-su is? My min-su is dead, you don't remember? It can't be. That was a dream. Where is my boy? Where's yoon-su?! You must be in shock, please calm down. We have to find yoon-su's, I mean, min-su's body first. No, that's not right. Just why? Why did you kill him? Why kill yoon-su? Who killed who? Are you making us all into murderers? Let's all calm down. Ma'am, you know that I'm a cop, right? Handcuffs. He was cuffed. My boy was handcuffed. What did you do to him? What the hell did you do?! Snap out of it! You don't know if min-su was your boy. Never saw him up close, and who killed him? He ran away from you and got swept away! They are innocent people who can live without laws. You'll go to hell. Hell? Really? You call yourselves humans? I can't stand it anymore. We raised an abandoned retard as if he was ours, how dare you accuse us?! Bitch, my min-su died because of you! - Bring him back! - Will you stop it?! I want him back! - Just stop it! - I've had it! - Where are you going?! - Hey! - Get back here! - I said stop! Stop eating peanuts, motherfucker! Let's stop and think. Think about what? What did we do wrong? Did we kill him? Even if we didn't, we could be charged for abandonment or even kidnapping. If she reports us, I'll lose my badge, and we'll all get locked up. What? Why us? This has nothing to do with us! Nothing to do with you? Who here has not used the boy for work? The fishing spot is a goner, and with a bad reputation, this tourist village is over. I still got a lot of debt left. Throw her back into the ocean. She was gonna die anyway. Our trouble is over without her. What are you doing? Gonna kill my baby too?! Ji-ho, come here, let him go! - Ji-ho! Ji-ho! - Stop it! What kind of situation is this? Flounder's right. Without this one woman, everything's back to normal! No shops here need to close, an ex-con like me won't ever get another job. My boy can't live like me! He has to go to college, and I gotta make more money for his tuition! The milk has been spilled, let's just bury her. Milk's been spilled... By the way, Mr. choi. Yes? Since when did you make decisions by yourself?! I make the decision! You just have to follow my orders! Why are you so damn chatty?! Do what I say, got it?! Fucking bitches... - Flounder. - Yes? Close down the fishing spot today. Okay. Hong, will you let it go? When will the body surface? The handcuff bothers you? The tide will bring it in, you'll find it at the grave rock by tomorrow morning. Is that so? A dead kid won't swim away, everything gets washed over at the rock. It's called a grave rock for a reason. Everything gets caught up there. Do you know how she feels? How would I know? I don't even know myself. I know everything about what's under here, but I can't figure people out. Sgt. Hong. The living must keep on living. We have to keep a lid on it. Sure, keep a lid on it. We must shut our mouths, ears and eyes. Min-su really took after you. Long eyelashes, and tender skin... Are you cold? I got your clothes. What's this? Shit, is this for getting high? I tried this a long time ago too. Tell me what his life was like here. I'll tell you everything, how he spent his time here. Ahn, kang and granny, they're shit heads. They always put a leash on him and beat him like crazy, he dripped pus from his ears. But I was always so nice to him. I hugged him to keep him warm too. He was so happy that it was warm. What kind of a boy was he? He drew really well. He drew so many doodles in the storage container. Be nice to me and I'll let you live, and take you there to see his drawings. Fucking hell, you're so hot... It's uncomfortable. What is? Untie me. It'll be worth it. Goddammit, you should've told me that before! You drive me crazy, give me a second! I'll do exactly what I did to min-s... With him dead, I was getting so lonely... What was that? "Kim yoon-su" I must've grown fond of min-s... Fond of him? Fuck that. It's all in the past. I feel really terrible. Let this one thing go. It'll be like it never happened. Go to sleep, shut up. For the sake of humanity, we must perform our duty for the future. Stop it. - Come here, bitch. - Stop it! Come here, get over here! What?! Come here! What's with you? An important duty. Very important. What the fuck?! How could you do that to him? How... Don't you dare! You couldn't even look after your kid, bitch! I told you I'd kill you! You fucking bitch! You psychotic bitch! Where do you think you are?! Why are you testing me?! I'm a fucking cop! Fucking bitch! Do I look like a chump? Answer me! I'll reunite you with your bastard! This fucking hurts! Ma'am, ma'am! Let's go! Stay away! Where are you going? I won't ask twice! Stay away! That's not right, I treated min-su so well. Right, ji-ho? Let go! Let go of it! Call the police! I'm a cop! I'm a fucking cop! Where do you think you are? Where are you, fucking bitch? Let's go. Come on. Like that will work, let's end this. Don't lose your kid in hell. My eye! My eye! Fucking bitch! I'll kill you! God fucking damn! Die, bitch! Die! Die! Diel You thought you could live through this? Just die! I've had it! Are you having fun?! Go to hell, and find your kid or whatever! Do whatever you want! Crazy bastard! You little shit! Come here, you fuck! Come here! You little shit! Fuck! Shit! Get over here! Come here! What the hell? Did you just cuff a cop?! Fucking hell! Look at me, you shit! You think you can get out of here alive? I'm gonna fucking kill you, just watch me. Key, where's the key! My fucking key! My key! I'm so fucked... Uncuff me! Dammit! Fucking hell! Wait! Please! Please! Is anyone there? Please help me! It's all my fault! Thousands of people come to this spot a month, no one ever took interest in him, so why me?! No one gave a damn! They were all like me! Help! Please help me! Don't go. I'll be right back. Promise me. Thank you. My baby... Yoon-su... My baby... My baby... This can't be... What do I do... "2 years later” "Ji-ho" hey, son! Mom, are you home? No, I'm driving. Right, I forgot that you went to look for yoon-su. Is everything okay? The school's not over yet. I know, I called so I don't forget. Forget about what? I wanted to tell you my dream, but forgot in the morning. I called so I don't forget again. Interesting, what kind of dream was it? It was about min-su, I met him in the dream. You saw min-su? Were you happy to see him? Yeah, I was happy. Was he doing well? Yes. It was by a blue ocean. He was playing with other kids. They all looked so happy. I called him and he was so happy to see me too. So we all played for a long time. Then he had to leave and told me to tell you something. Don't forget about us, don't give up... Someone came to see you. Please find us. And... I love you, mom.
