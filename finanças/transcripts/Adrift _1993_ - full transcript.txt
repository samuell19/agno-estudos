[music playing] [suspenseful music playing] [screaming] They're gonna kill us! [screaming] [gasping] Ahh! Oh! Uh, uh, uh! Oh! [chatter] Beat! Oh, lovely! [chatter] PARTY GUEST 1: You're going tohave no depositions, no clients in your face for three months. I give you a week before you come crawling back. I don't think so. It'll take us a month to get to Samoa. Oh, it sounds like the hanging judge wants to lock you up for a while. [giggling] You guys. PARTY GUEST 1: I'm sure thatbeneath that gruff exterior beats a heart of unbridled passion. How did you know? Who is that? PARTY GUEST 1: Someone I'd liketo be stranded at sea with. PARTY GUEST 2: I'll flip you for him. SAM: Yeah, but three months, Guy? A boat can get awfully small in three months. Not as small as the benchhas been this past year, Sam. You know, I really need this vacation. And Katie needs a rest too. Katie had just as soon fly to Europe. Think again, old boy. You see that deck? 1972, December 20, in themiddle of the Caribbean. That's where I proposed to Katie. Yeah? What'd she say? [laughter] Hi. You're not supposed to be here. I can't believe you're doing this. Adam, we've been over this 1,000 times. I have a family. I've been married for 20 years. I'm not going to give them up. This can't work. You should leave. Well, bon voyage. [chatter] JULIE NAST: Mom? Hi, sweetheart. Look at you. You look wonderful. Oh, by the time you guys get back, you won't even recognize me. Well, you behave yourself, all right? I'll try not to wreck the car. You better try real hard, kiddo. Ooh, I'm going to miss you. I love you too, Mom. Can I pry you two apart for a minute? [camera clicking] [cheering and clapping] A toast to our intrepid voyagers. Bon voyage! [camera clicking] GUY NAST: Look at this. Is this beautiful or what? Yes, it is. It's just the first week. After a couple of months, you'llbe fighting me not to go home. Are you that uncomfortable out here? Oh, what do you mean? Come on, Katie. I feel like I'm-- like I've spent a weekin paradise with somebody who's planning a mutiny. Don't worry. I won't spoil your dream vacation. I thought it was supposedto be our dream vacation. I'm sorry. Talk to me, Katie. Boats get pretty small out here. Give a girl a chance to get her sea legs? OK. [music playing] Mm. That was superb, Captain. Always a pleasure cookingfor my beautiful first mate. Mm. It's a calm night. No one around for 1,000 miles or so. We could-- uh-- go up on deck, lay out a blanket, make love under the stars. Like when we were in grad school? Up on the bluffs. In the buff. [cat meowing] [laughing] GUY NAST: Counsel-- KATIE NAST: Hm? I want to see you in chambers. KATIE NAST: Motion granted. GUY NAST: Mm-hm. [laughter] Raven. Raven, come in. Do you read me? [radio static] Raven. Raven, come in. Do you read me? [radio static] Thank god that thing's been destroyed. No response. We better go aboard. [sinister music playing] Hello! [sinister music playing] Stay there. [sinister music playing] [groaning] [inaudible]. GUY NAST: Katie! Down here! [sinister music playing] Help us. You must be starved. No. Thanks. I'll wait for Eliza. She's got a bit of a fever. Could take a while. I'll wait. I could sure use a smoke, though. Sure. What happened out there? Just about everything. Where'd you sail out of? Alleywine. A maiden voyage. We hired a crew out of a local fuel port. She cooked. He was a mechanic. Cruising Monday to Monday, two weeks. Five days out we hitsomething, underwater wreckage. It was so big it ripped a big hole in the boat. Busted off the propeller. Boat leaked. We lost everything, engine, electrics. We drifted for weeks. The sun beating down on us. Sun can make a man crazy. Our crew couldn't take it. What did they do? [sighing] Turned on us one night in a storm. We were trying to save the boat,and they were just all over us. Like they weren't human. They tried to kill us. What happened to them? They went overboard. It was them or us, man. Did you notify the Coast Guard? The power was out. Is it possible that thosetwo people are still alive? Well, if they are, it's a miracle. If the storm didn't get them, the sharks did. Well, you're lucky to be alive, Nick. Scum of the Western world hangsaround in these fuel ports. Any good sailor knows that. Yeah. I should have been more careful. I'm going to go check on Eliza. Thanks. [coughing] You're awake. I think she's going to be all right. [coughing] [whimpering] OFFICER [ON RADIO]: Roger, Bellage. Your report is received and acknowledged. Please contact authorities on arrival. We'll notify the search party. Let me just get you-- hold on. GUY NAST: Roger. Bellage out. Coast Guard's sending a launch to the Raven. There'll be an investigation. They'll either tow it or they'll sink it. I hope I never see that boat again. Do you have any relativesthat you'd like us to contact? Thanks. Oh, no. Um-- no family. We're orphans. This is family right here. What-- uh-- port are we headed to? Honolulu. Depending on the wind, we should be there-- Oh! Oh! Oh. I'm so sorry. Oh, oh, oh. Guy, would you get the first aid kit, please? Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, sorry. Let me take a look. Luckily, it's not all that deep. I feel so skinny. Couple home-cooked meals, you'll feel fine. Now wounds tend to get infected out here, so I'm going to give you some penicillin. Um-- no. I'm allergic. All right. Try this. So how did you two meet? Oh, Nick. We've known each other forever. I can't believe I almost lost him. Well, you need some rest. You'll be fine. Last night was great. Guy, it's been a really long day. I'm exhausted. [knocking] Morning. Brought you some things to wear. I think we're about the same size. Take what you need. I practically live in aT-shirt and a pair of shorts. You'll need these. [cat shrieking] Oh! ELIZA TERRIO: Oh, I'm sorry. Cats and I don't get along. Skipper. I was clawed once when I was four and since then cats scare me. KATIE NAST: Not Skipper. You must have been through a lot. Yeah. Well, sometimes the worst thingyou can do is trust people. [giggling] I remember when we used to look like that. GUY NAST: Like what? Oh. Like we were in our own world and nothing else existed except the two of us. That's the look of twopeople happy to be alive. Oh, no. There's much more. Look at the way they hold each other. They're living in the moment. [giggling] When was the last time wedid anything spontaneous? It tried to do somethingspontaneous last night, Katie. Oh, Guy. Still trying to find your sea legs? No. Just thinking about how strange it is sometimes the way things work out. We fall in love and we try to build the perfect life with the one person who wants everything we want. Once we're married and we're raising kids, we lose sight of everything that drew us together in the first place. And-- I don't know what I'm saying. I think you do knowwhat you're saying, Katie. I lost sight of it, Guy. Who is he? It's not important. It is very important! It's a lawyer I work with, OK? Who? Guy, please. How long has this been going on? How long have you beenmaking a fool of me, Katie? It doesn't matter. It's over. Are you in love with this guy? No. No. No. God. It's like I don't even know who you are. I'm so sorry. I had to tell you. Your candor is to be admired. Guy-- Sweetie. What, do we look OK? Sure. Hi. KATIE NAST: Dinner's served. Geez. This is-- wow. - This is great. - Hope you like it. Uh-- go ahead and start. Um-- Sorry. OK. Thank you. This is a really beautiful boat. Did you design it? Give Guy all the credit. Oh. It's-- it's really tasteful. Thank you. Ahh. So what do you do? Um-- uh-- Nick runs a nightclub. And uh-- I'm a housewife, I guess. You know, I was looking at the-- uh-- the chart a little earlier. And I saw a bunch of islands that seem a lot closer than Honolulu. The-- um-- the Marquesas. And I thought, you know, maybe you might want to take us there and-- There's nothing in the Marquesas. There's an airport. But there's no Coast Guard. There's one in Honolulu,and I have a responsibility to take you there. Yeah, of course. I just-- um. You know, seems to be a lot of work sailing. I mean, I mean, I-- I never realized just-- Thought you said you'dbeen sailing a couple years. No, sir, not sailboats. Um-- I've only been on power boats. You know, I'd like to learn, though. I mean, you know, you can show me stuff and-- I mean, I can help you. I mean, it's the least we can do. I just-- If I have time. Well, maybe, you know, Katie can-- um-- No, Katie ispreoccupied at the moment. OK. I'm going to call the Wilsons. Tell them we're going to be late. ELIZA TERRIO: Who are the Wilsons? KATIE NAST: Friends we're meeting in Samoa. Nick? Hey, hey, hey, hey. - What happened? - It's all right. It's all right. Circuit must have blown. [cat meowing] Need anything? No. Good night. [laughter] [sighing, panting, giggling] [groaning] [knocking] NICK TERRIO: [PANICKED] Eliza! Guy. NICK TERRIO: [PANICKED] Open the door! Something's wrong. ELIZA TERRIO: Nick, calm down. NICK TERRIO: Let me out! Hey! Damn it! Let me out of here! He's locked himself in. GUY NAST: Here, here. NICK TERRIO: Let me out! Open the door! Come on, let me out! Those locks can be a little tricky. Thanks. KATIE NAST: Skipper! Skipper! Can I be of help? Wind shifted. We have to adjust the sails. - What do I do? - Take the wheel. First rule of sailing. Watch the luff. Keep the sails trimmed. Yeah, it's nothing at all like a motor boat. There's so much other stuff to think about. You know, the rigging and the lines and-- Look. It's perfect now. Oh, wow. Look at that. It's all yours. Did you get some sleep last night? Yeah, I was fine. I had a friend who was claustrophobic. Couldn't get her near a boat. I'm not claustrophobic. I-- it's-- uh-- was just a moment there, you know, when I was kind oflike being back on the Raven. I just-- [whipping sound] Oops! Huh. OK. You just jibe this. There you go. NICK TERRIO: You know, Iknow the words like jibing and tacking, but I-- I just don't know what they mean. KATIE NAST: Well, jibing's whenyou turn the stern of the boat. That's the back. NICK TERRIO: I know that's the back. KATIE NAST: Yeah. Into the wind. And if you turn the bow-- NICK TERRIO: It's the front. KATIE NAST: --the front, that's tacking. NICK TERRIO: [chuckling] OK,what else can you tell me? KATIE NAST: What else do you want to know? Lunch is served. I'll just go get changed. Thank you. I have to ask you guys a question. Nick and I are really grateful. I just have to be honest. We feel like we've caused some trouble. Trouble? Well, it's just it's asmall boat and voices carry. It's nothing, I assure you. I'm sorry. So how long have you two been married? 20 years. Uh-- "To Judge Nast. Justice is truly blind." Is that you? That's a joke. A friend of ours from law school days. Wow, I'll be damned. I've never rubbed elbows with a judge before. What kind of cases do you handle? Criminal. Have you ever sentenced anyone to death? Taking someone's life is serious business. It's-- it's not a subjectfor casual conversation. But do you believe in it? I mean, the death penalty? I don't think killing someone for their crime ever solved anything. Well, the system, however flawed Katie thinks it is, is all we've got. So you commit a crime, you get punished. You kill someone and-- of course, there are alwaysmitigating circumstances. Do you think there's somethingelse we should have done? That's between you and Nick. But do you think that we did the right thing? I'm sure you did what you felt you had to do. KATIE NAST: You have to understand. Guy is bound by professional ethics to remain objective and remove himself. He does it very well. But we're not in a courtroom. Why can't you just tell meif we did the right thing? GUY NAST: Why is my opinionso important to you? It's irrelevant what I think. No. Forget who you are for just a moment and consider what we went through out there. Your precious system did not protect us. It has never protected us. I want you to step out from behind the bench and tell me that you understand what we did. Eliza, you're asking me to absolve you. I don't know all the facts. I can't do that. This is a matter between you and your conscience. Fine. Where did that come from? Think about it. Maybe she just wanted a little compassion. Like everybody else. [engine cranking] Now what the hell is wrong? NICK TERRIO: Well, at least she's not dead. Sounds like something's fouling the propeller. Could be seaweed. Yeah, we passed through a patch yesterday. I've got enough thingswrong with this damn boat. I don't need a dead engine on top of it. What are you doing? I've got to go down and seewhat's binding that propeller. Look like she's caught on some sort of rope. What do you want me to do? Common sense says you starther up and put her in reverse. Right. Thanks. [engine sputtering] Now back to neutral. He may need some help. Nick, grab my mask out of the bench locker. [ominous music playing] Shut it down! Shut it down! What the hell happened? I don't know. Nick must have hit the throttle. Are you OK? [coughing] Nick should not be doing this. I want you to-- [coughing] I've got to go back down. No. I'll go. Come on. OK. - You all right? - Yeah. All right. [screaming] How could it happen? I don't know. He was careful around the boat. Well, accidents happen. Suppose it wasn't an accident. Now Katie, let it go. OK? Ahh. Is there a problem? That was drinking water. There were 5 gallons in there. Yeah, it was hot, you know. If you're hot, take a swim. It's only water. What are we supposed to drink? Chardonnay? All right, that's enough. I think it's time we set some limits. NICK TERRIO: Yeah, that's something you're good at, setting limits. A gallon a day. You can do what you want with it. You can wash with it, you can drink it, you can urinate in it. But a gallon is all we get. Is that understood? Aye aye, Cap'n. I could use a hand here. Nick. I'd be glad to give you a hand. All right. Things are going to get worse. With no wind and no radio,we could be out here a while. So you can't fix the short, huh? Look, I mean, I could give you a hand. If you'd like. Trouble is, when we stockedthe boat in Marina Del Rey, we didn't count on havingfour people aboard. What, you're not tellingme this boat's low on food? KATIE NAST: We might be able toget the meat salted and dried before any of it spoils. But if we're out heremuch longer, I don't know. Well, why why don't wejust crank the engine then? Any good sailor would knowwhy we don't do that, Nick. Just tell me. We'd get about 500 milesand then we run out of fuel. Yeah, we'd be 500 miles further on. Not quite, pal. We'd be stuck in the middle of the sea with no power left to maneuver. Still want to crank the engine, Nick? Stop riding me, man. So what happens? Well, if we don't show up soon, the Wilsons will notify the Coast Guard. We're in a shipping lane. Keep an eye out for other boats. Why don't we rotate? Nick and I'll take the first shift. You looking for something? I was looking at your photos. They're quite nice. - Oh, really. And our bank books. Are they quite nice too? What do you mean? I think you have a knack for trouble. First the Raven. Then you come aboard our boat. We lose electricity. Our cat mysteriously goes overboard. What are you saying? I'm saying he didn't go over by himself, did he? I didn't kill your stupid cat! What's going on? She was going through our things. ELIZA TERRIO: I was not. - What's happening? I was not. She's accusing me! - Hold on. Hold on! Now somebody tell me what is going on here. Katie. I heard a noise. I got up. I found her going through our records. Eliza, is that true? No, I was on shift, and Ijust wanted to go to the head, and I saw these photos. Oh, no. And our checkbooks too? God knows what else. Eliza would never do that. You don't like me, do you? Oh, please. No, it's-- it's true. You don't even like Guy. You just want to sleep with my husband. Now that's enough of that! How dare you? So are we dismissed, Judge? Look, I don't know what kind of a world you've been living in, Nick. But out here the laws are different. There's something wrong with that girl. She was going through ourthings and the way she snapped? I know she killed Skipper. Damn it, say something! I don't like these peopleany more than you do. But we have to bear with them another week. I'll tell you one thing, though. She may be a bit peculiar,but she's perceptive. What does that mean? Look me in the eye, Katie. Tell me you don't find Nick attractive. I don't. Now what? Morning. I know we're supposed to be rationing, but this stuff was going bad anyway. After all you've done for us, noone deserves this more than you two. I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have said those things. Well, this is the only thing I could think of to make it up to you. Oh, really? She said she's sorry. Apology accepted. A little afternoon tea? Thank you. ELIZA TERRIO: Katie? KATIE NAST: No, thanks. ELIZA TERRIO: Are you sure? It's nice and hot. Maybe later. May I take the wheel? Why not? I love tea. On the Raven, it was the onlything that kept us alive. I made jars of it on the deck in the sun. You know, I'm surprised no onepicked you up in all that time. If your emergencytransmitter had been working, someone would have found you. I assume it was broken. Oh, it was ruined, like everything else. I mean, there was water all over the place. That's interestingbecause those transmitters are activated by the-- [whirring sound] Katie! Are you OK? I'm OK. Come on. What the hell are you doing? What did I do? You made us jibe. I didn't know. Now I got the heading locked in. Now just leave it. She'll sail herself. Here. All right, take it easy. All right, hold me. There you go. GUY NAST: OK. Water activates those transmitters. They must have sabotaged it. That's the reason no one found them. They were out too far and the search party was looking in the wrong place. Eliza knew exactly whatshe was doing with that boom. And Nick's claustrophobic. I don't know why he bothers to hide it. Those two people are not the owners of the Raven. We got to do something. What's the matter? I'm going to be sick. Guy? GUY NAST: [coughing] [knocking] You OK? GUY NAST: I'm not sure. [vomiting and coughing] [ominous music playing] KATIE NAST: It must have been the tea. They poisoned you. I'll be right back. Careful. [rock music playing] JULIE NAST [ON RECORDING]:You might want to close your ears for this one, Mom. [dance music playing] Good evening. What's this all about? Isn't that a great tape? Her daughter has such good taste. Don't touch me! I'd be real careful withthat ax if I were you. I don't think Guy's going to be able to help you on this one. Don't go too far. [gunshot] Hey! Get me a beer while you're down there. Oh, she was going to throwus overboard and make us swim. Well, if she doesn'tchop our heads off first. [dance music playing] [gunshots] That bitch is in our room. Nick's got a gun. They're going to kill us. We have to get off the boat. Come on. Where is she? - We won't make it. - Yes, we will. We're in the shipping lane. Someone will pick us up. NICK TERRIO: [whistle] Hey! Abandoning ship already? Well, how are we this evening? Just a little something to help you sleep. - What do you want? - You bastard? Oh, come on. Not both at once. One at a time. Now you had a question. Relax. We're not going to kill you. We just want your boat. And some money. We're going to need some money. Your money. We will let you keep your daughter. Oh! Well, because we don't want her. Have I left anything out? We'll hurt you if you force us to. That's right. We'll hurt you. [gasping] Honey. I think it's time to beredefining some roles here. We all got to pull our own weight, don't we, Cap'n? We saved your lives. And we will be forever grateful. Now shut up! NICK TERRIO [VOICEOVER]: Look,I just say we kill them now. I mean, you heard what they said. There's not enough foodon board for four people. ELIZA TERRIO [VOICEOVER]:Nicky, we need them to sail and we still have to get their money. Have you forgotten? NICK TERRIO [VOICEOVER]: Yeah, but-- ELIZA TERRIO [VOICEOVER]:We don't want to make the same mistake twice, do we?NICK TERRIO [VOICEOVER]: No. ELIZA TERRIO[VOICEOVER]: Tomorrow you put the power back on, and everything will be fine. OK, honey, give it a try. ELIZA TERRIO: Nothing. I don't know what he did down there. I can't fix it. I thought you knew what you were doing. Well, he screwed me up. Hey. I want these decks sparkling. I want those ropes coiled. You know, I want to be ready for anything. Because that's the way it is with the sea. She'll throw all kinds of crap at you. Pfft. See, you've got to be ready for anything. Huh? Come on, where's my second mate?Come on, let's go. Let's get the sails up. Let's go. Remember, Katie. You can see the heading. The compass never lies. So don't try to change direction on us. I'm going to plot the course to the Marquesas. You know how? You sail the boat, and I'll worry about plotting the course. Nick, why don't you show Guy to his new quarters and get Katie started on some lunch? NICK TERRIO: [whistle] Guy, come on. [whistle] I'm starved. [buzzing] Your new home. Be good to it. Oh, and thanks for lunch. [thunder] Hey! Get up! We need you on deck. What's wrong? Get up! [thunder] What's wrong? You tell me. You're the captain. Hey! Don't get smart. Tell me what's wrong and fix it! The halyard's stuck. We can't lower the mainsail. Well, we're gonna get swamped. Kind of looks that way, doesn't it? Ah! Fix it. Guy, do it. Please. You have to go up in the bosun's chair to get to the sail. No, I'm not going up in that thing. You! Don't leave the wheel. Hoist me up! So what do you think, counselor? Do you still think it's useless to kill someone for their crimes? Isn't that funny? We gave Guy a chance tounderstand, and he refused. And look what happened to him. You'd kill us now if you hadthe chance, wouldn't you? I mean, who are we kidding? [laughing] I mean, weboth know that we're going to have to kill you eventually. And we both know that you'regoing to try and stop us. Isn't that exciting? I can hardly wait to see what happens. [laughing] [grunting] Go on, Katie. All right, Cap'n. Back to your room. Come on. Come on. It's a game to her, Guy. The whole thing's a game. She's daring us to try to kill them. I don't think she cares ifshe lives or if she dies. Well, let's just hope that Nick does. ELIZA TERRIO: Katie. Hey! Your shift. Let's go. Don't forget which way is south. Remember, someone is always watching you. [buzzing] Ahoy, Bellage. Are you in need of assistance? One word, and I'll kill you. Bellage. Are you in need of assistance? We're A-OK. I repeat, A-OK. Your [inaudible] reportedtransmitting a distress signal. It's-- it's malfunctioning. We're all right. Roger. We'll relay your status to the Coast Guard. Good sailing, Bellage. Bitch! There's an emergency transmitter on board. They must have turned it on. Turn it off. Now! Get the other one. Come on. I guess that was your best shot. This is not working out the way we had hoped. You see what happens when you trust people? We gave you a chance. And instead you judged us. We're not bad people. We don't judge others. We don't sleep around. We don't argue in public. You are therefore chargedwith neglect and deceit. This is ridiculous. - Order! - How do you plead? Guilty. Very well. Sentence will be death, tobe carried out immediately. Hey, it's the system at work. You can't do this. On your feet, sailor. Now. If you're going to shoot me, do it now. KATIE NAST: No! You kill us, you can't sail the boat. We don't have to. We got a motor for that. Besides, sailing's no problem. I had a real good teacher. Engine's worthless. It won't run. I fixed it. And you can't sail 5 feet without help. You're lying. Go check it out. NICK TERRIO: Oh, no! You're going to regret this. No fuel filter. You're down to sail, Nick. So what. It'll take a little longer. We're in no rush. You better not be. It's 600 miles to the Marquesas. You think you can sail this boat 600 miles? You'll run into storms. You'll hit those windless days. You'll run out of food and water. Who's going to navigate? Have you thought about that? Who's going to work the sails? She is. It's just too bad that you won't be with her. No. It doesn't work like that. You kill him, I go to. ELIZA TERRIO: Aw. I'm so glad to see you twohave patched things up. OK. You have a deal. First, he must pay for his crime. No! Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ahh! Oh, oh oh, oh oh! Ah! See that, Katie? That was strike one. But he still has arms and hands. Don't make us break those too. Now, tell us where we are. KATIE NAST: Here. About 620 nautical miles from the Marquesas. With these light winds, it'll take us 10 days, maybe two weeks to get there. Good girl, Katie. Now you can eat. When does Guy eat? Later. When? He's had a well-fed life. He won't starve. He's hurt. He's gone a whole day without food. A man can go for days without food. Not Guy. His system's not used to it. Listen, I don't want to hear it! You think anybody gets used togoing without food, huh, lady? You try laying in a dark closet for days. Huh, when they put youunder the stairs, you can-- Nick, that's enough. I need to use the head. OK. But leave the door open. I don't want you out of my sight. [ominous music playing] Too cramped for you down there? I can see why. I don't blame you, Nick. Blame me for what? For what's happening to Guy and me. That's a laugh. Doesn't seem a whole lotworse than what you two were already doing to each other. We love each other. You never plan on growingapart from someone. It's just as much my fault. Iwas so busy trying to get ahead and then trying to stay there, I just didn't see what was happening. You rich people, youjust get all the chances. Because you've never, everhad to deal with hard times. You didn't get any of those chances? Not spending the first half of my life bouncing around foster homes, no. Is that what you meant about the closets? Yeah. Yeah, that's not a way of growing up I'd recommend to people. How'd you meet Eliza? She fed me. You've really beenthrough a lot, haven't you? Why don't you just go downstairs and I'll sail the boat? I think Eliza wanted me to sail the boat, Nick. Good night. [music playing] So clean that up. Eliza, honey, come and havea look at this for a second. NICK TERRIO: Hey! You trying to poison us? [music playing] Stop treating us like animals. I need food for Guy. If he dies, I swear to Godyou'll never see land again. I know you know what it's liketo be hungry, to wait for food. Please. Just give her the rest. You do realize there will be less for you. Just give it to her, all right? You want to feed him? Go ahead and feed him. It's not much. Try to save some for later. Listen, I've turned us north toward Hawaii. That should give us an extra week, maybe more. I need some tape, surgicaltape, any kind of tape. Can you get it for me? I'll try. Keep looking at me. They were brought uptogether in a foster home. I think they were badly abused. Meal time's over. Work on him. He'll want to talk, I know it. You really don't have to do that, Nick. I'm not going anywhere. Look, um-- Eliza-- If you let her kill us, you won't make it. You'll starve to death. Need to use the head. Hurry up. You want me to keep the door open? This doesn't make any sense. What? I plotted our course andwe're not where we should be. Something's not right. Did you hear what I said? Check it out! You insist on causing trouble byrefusing to live by our rules. Don't you understand howyour behavior affects us? Shut up! You had us going the wrong way. You had us going in circles. We gave you a chance to work with us, which is certainly more thananyone has ever given us. And it's certainly more than people like you ever give people like us. Oh! ELIZA TERRIO: Darling, I want you with me. Put her hand in. KATIE NAST: [whimpering] Did you hear what I said? No. Put her hand in. Her left hand. No. I think he likes you. KATIE NAST: No! It's justice. No! [music playing] ELIZA TERRIO: How could you do this? I-- I just lost my head, I think. After all I've done for you? Who took care of those people on the Raven? Who killed that cop to keepyou from going to prison when we know that youcouldn't have handled it? NICK TERRIO: You did, babe. So why is it when theone time that I need you, you're not there for me? [crying] So, how's it going? I haven't seen what's his face in a while. Is he still alive? Hard to tell. I don't think you guys are going to live to see our dreams come true. You're sick. NICK TERRIO: Hey, hey! Let me out! [knocking] Eliza? Let me out! Let me out! Hey! Let me out! Eliza, let me out! I think Nicky needs me. I'm here, honey. NICK TERRIO: Where the hell were you? I hate this boat. ELIZA TERRIO: It's all right, baby. [heavy breathing] Sometimes those locks can be tricky. Hm? [sinister music playing] Very good. You're getting there. Yeah, I'm kind of having a little trouble with the G. Whoa! A brunette. You like it? Mm! Who do you think looks better in this dress? NICK TERRIO: You do, babe. ELIZA TERRIO: Hm. Did you hear that? Let's see what else he likes. This could be fun. So you two have things pretty well worked out. Mm-hm. Your plan, I suppose. Our plan. You make a good team. You're always there for her. That's right. She's always there for me. Really? Took her an awful long time tolet you out of the head today, Nick. She was having trouble with the lock. No, she wasn't. She was up on deck talking to me. She heard you screaming. She just-- she just didn't go. You watch your mouth. KATIE NAST: Come on, Nick. It was no accident you gotlocked in the head today. Just like it was no accidentyou got locked in those closets and you didn't get fooduntil Eliza came to feed you. You shut up. Isn't it strange, Nick? You were both treated so badly? But you're the only one with the claustrophobia and the fear of starvation. Who let her out? She loves me. She controls you. She controls you through fear. Think about it, Nick. Whose idea was it to get on the Raven? It wasn't yours, was it? Nick, look at this one. [UNENTHUSIASTICALLY] Oh, that's great. Nick? Are you sure? [QUIETLY] Yeah. Yeah, it's good. What's happening up there? They made me correct course. We have only a day, maybe two left. What's this? It's nothing. Katie, what happened? It's a burn. Eliza was having a little fun with me. Katie. I'm so sorry. I got so caught up in everything, I just let you slip away. I didn't know what I had. And now I just want it back. I want you back. I'm right here. I'm right here. NICK TERRIO: Time's up. Thank you, Nick. That really meant a lot-- You think I don't know thegames you're playing, huh? You think I don't know what you're up to? You're a bad liar. I could kill you right now! Eliza was right. You thought you could pitus against each other, huh? ELIZA TERRIO: When are you finally going to realize thatnothing can come between us? You know what to do, Nicky. It's the only way. [struggling and grunting] No! I want to get off this boat, and she's the only one who can do it. Finish it. [sobbing] [ominous music playing] NICK TERRIO: We're ready for our lunch. Give that to me. What? Tin can lid. That's what you're after, isn't it? No. Chili's boiling over. I came to stir it. Let me see that. Hm. Smells good. Honey, you want some? I'm not hungry. Come on. Come on, come on. Give me the rest. You look just like her, you know? It was the plan, wasn't it? Listen. In a couple of days, we're going to have everything we've always wanted. Just the two of us without them. You'll never get away with this. We already have. Who are you? Katie Nast. And this is my husband, Guy. He used to be loyal to me. The wind's up. You hungry? No. I think you are. No, I said I'm not hungry. Mm. It's really delicious. All the meat and spices. All you have to do is ask. No. Mm. Could always beg. [heavy breathing] [choking] [gasping] NICK TERRIO: Land! I see land! Sherry? Sherry! [struggling and grunting] [sobbing] It was going to be all right. You bitch! You bitch! Let me out! I'll kill you! [panicked breathing] She's dead, Nick, I'm sorry. No. You're not sorry. No. That's what you wanted all along. No. You brought it on yourselves. We'll see. [door closing] [door closing] [ominous music playing] [whipping sound] Ah. [music playing] Guy. [gasping] [screaming] Katie! KATIE NAST: Oh! Hold me. You're safe now, Katie. Hold me. You're safe now. Hold me. I will. Oh! You're safe. You're safe. [music playing]
