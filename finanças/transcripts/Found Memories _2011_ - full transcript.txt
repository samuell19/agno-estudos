'Morning 'Morning Madalena, you can just leave the bread on the basket, I'll arrange it later. Annoying old man. The sun is barely rising, he's getting me started. Oh, I see you had a bad night's sleep. Tonho, would you mind being quiet for a while? How about you? Would you mind doing it the way I'm telling you to? Move over there. Go make your coffee, the water's almost boiling. Stubborn old lady. There's some rain on the way. My bones are killing me. On behalf of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. For the grace that's been given to me, I tell each one among you to not think of yourself beyond what's you're entitled to. Think, before, in moderation, according to how much faith God bestowed upon each one. Serve one another, each according to the blessing you received. Because blessings and the call of God can't be taken back. Let's pray. My love, I'd like to keep our memory forever alive, so our love in the future doesn't suffer from the passing of time. We have to go beyond death, this cruel enemy that didn't choose day or time. 'Morning 'Morning Leave the bread on the basket, I'll arrange it later. What do I do, then? Nothing. How hard is it to do it the way I tell you to? Leave the bread on the basket! I'll have to take it all out later anyway! Go make that terrible coffee. I'm the one who deals with the bread. Stubborn old lady. But only this much water? You don't know how to appreciate coffee. I've never seen this! He's saving water now! Water's for free, you know? Lf you want to drink dirty water, go grow your own coffee. In my shop, we drink real coffee! There's some rain on the way. Guilherme Orsini, 1924-1976 A hawk! Lord Jesus have mercy. Imagine what the night will be like. We should get ready for the cold. It's cold during the day already. Good afternoon. I've been travelling around this area and I am looking for a place to stay. It's just for a couple or three days. Mam, I'll take that first bedroom, ok? There's no need to bother, mam. No trouble at all. Mam?! Please knock before you come in. How did you end up here? Walking, following the tracks. My love, Today I found one of your shirts. Isn't it weird that after all these years I keep finding your things around the house? Maybe time is catching on and my mind is playing tricks on me. Madalena. Guilherme Orsini - Good night. - 'Morning What's that? - What? - That. A camera. Bring the lantern. Sorry. Is it a cake? Bread! Don't you eat the bread? I don't care for it. - What? - I don't like it. - Would you like some manioc? - No, thanks. It's late already. Anita's been here. Madalena, leave it here and I'll arrange it later. How hard is it to do it the way I tell you? Leave it here and I'll arrange it later. Tonho, what do you think of young people? My oldest died under a tractor. He didn't die right away, only six hours later. The other one was drowned in Para?ba river and the other one they killed in Volta Redonda. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Amen. Good Morning Good Afternoon No entrance Good afternoon This is Rita... Good Afternoon Good Afternoon Can I help you with anything? - Who's this one? - She arrived yesterday. What is she doing here? I don't know. You didn't knock. It's my house. Were you singing? Do you want to listen? I like the serenades better. - Good evening. - Good evening. Do you know if there's anything open around here? No, there's nothing. - What's this can? - It's a camera. It's a simpler version. These cameras of yours... One is filled with lights and buttons, the other one is a can. Look, this is how it shows. But there's no one here. Only old stuff! In the old days there was a photographer who used to come by. Everyone would put on their best clothes, do their hair... The poor would put on costumes and come running to have their photos taken. Even the dirtiest ones looked like noble people. Then they would send the photos over to their distant relatives so it would look like they were successful. How about you? Why do you have your picture taken? I don't. I just liked to see my soul together with Guilherme's. Are you going to the mass? What time? Night, day. What does it matter? Madalena? Can I take your picture? - Now? - Yes! Like this? Sure, you look great! Look. Oh, Lord. - 'Morning. - 'Morning. - By yourself? - She's sleeping. Those young people, they are so lazy. Ant?nio, do you think I'm old? Old and stubborn! My husband used to tell me: Madalena, when I look at you I don't see you as you are, I see you as you were, when you were 20, and we got married. This is how I see you. I had a girlfriend who died when she was 18. Thank God I never saw her grow old. Because when I remember her, I'm 18 as well. When we have a good memory of our childhood, we shouldn't visit it after we grow old. What's left, then? Us? Would you mind being quiet for a while? Here's to you! Are you really having cacha?a? Women should be forbidden to drink. If you want, there's one with honey, it's softer. I prefer it pure, this is a man's vice! And what vices are women allowed to have, Ant?nio? To cry, to bear children, to sew, to pray... Father, I'd like to take some pictures inside the cemetery... - You're responsible for it, right? - What? I'd like to take some pictures inside the cemetery... Isn't you who keeps the key? The cemetery's been closed. I'm also leaving, Father. I have something to tell you. Who closed it? - Who closed what, girl? - The cemetery! - God did it. - What do you mean God? He spoke to the Father. And the Father spoke to us. But why? Did he give you any explanations? God doesn't need to explain anything, girl. He just went there and bam! He closed the cemetery. Only God has this kind of power. And the Father! Oh, Hil?rio, come too. Come have your picture taken. I won't, there's no one to leave these pictures for. Yeah, stay there, old people should stay far away! You're the old one. Now, stay still. In my childhood, I had a girlfriend who looked just like you, her name was Rita. - And did she look like me? - She did. - And then what happened? - She married my brother. We married young, but this picture was only taken later. Madalena, you can't touch it. Pictures fade when you caress them. You know, when my son was 1 year old, I got home and found him throwing up, Dr. Helio, who was a very good doctor, asked me what was wrong. I told him: I don't know, doc. 1 year after my son died, after one year he'd been underground, it was only then that I found out my son had fallen. The woman who was looking after him put him on top a cupboard to take his picture. And he fell. To take his picture! I got home and found him throwing up, evacuating... The next day was his funeral. Ah, Madalena, forgive me! I'm not God. You ask God for forgiveness. - Is this one you? - No. It looks like a collection. People kept leaving, and I stuck with the pictures. Why do you keep these pictures that are not yours? After all, what did you come here to do? Take pictures of empty towns? Maybe I was born in the wrong time! - Good night. - Good night. - Cacha?a? - Want some? Here's to our bar! Aren't you afraid to go out alone like this at night? And who else am I going to find besides you? I'm old but I can still handle it. I believe, I believe... - Good morning - Good morning Now, stay still. When I saw myself with a scarf over my head and an old nightgown, I laughed myself all the way to Ant?nio's. I laughed so hard I could barely handle it. Now you want another picture? Stop it, I'm all messy. I mean it! Let me see if you really mean it. I do, the others will laugh at me. Ok, I'll stop. This town reminds me of the stories my dad used to tell when I was a child. Do you like it here? I do. Then I'll leave it all to you. Look, you need to feel the timing of the dough with your hands. Now it needs to breathe. Because bread is like us, if it doesn't breathe, it gets stiff. Good morning! Good Morning! Now, you need to arrange the bread in the shelf. Madalena, don't start teaching the girl everything the wrong way! How hard is it to do it the way I tell you to? Ant?nio, don't you think she's the one who knows bread? Lord Jesus, it's a conspiracy! Listen, my daughter, to what your father has taught you: Don't think less of your mother's teachings. Don't trust your own knowledge! Receive my words and the years of your life shall multiply. I ask you one thing: Don't give me rich or poor, give me the bread I need. Because the blessings and the calling of God can't be taken back. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Go in peace and may God follow you. Thank the Lord. Who else wants it? Father? Let's make a toast? "People will die when their time comes. No one dies the day before." And here's to good health I thought you weren't coming. I listen to these sounds all day. I've never heard so much silence. Now all you need to do is deliver them to Ant?nio. Madalena? I'm leaving today. I'd like to thank you for everything. But you can't leave. I can't keep pretending I belong somewhere else. And where do you belong? Look, why don't you stay over a few more days? There's some rain on the way. I'm afraid to die. Then don't die. You can live as long as you want. Tonho, why don't you die too? And how about the coffee? This terrible coffee you make? I'm not unhappy enough. What are you doing? Switching sides. But this song is so good... Thanks. Ant?nio, on that church wall... Why don't you write down the other people that died? We forget to die around here. My dear, there's no one else to make the bread.
