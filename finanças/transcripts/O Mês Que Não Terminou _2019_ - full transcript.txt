For many, those millions of people taking the streets looked like a bolt of lightning on a clear blue sky. They held posters as they opposed police repression and flooded the symbolic landmarks of their cities, including the National Congress. After all, the country was in a period of economic growth, with low unemployment rates and inflation over control, plus high popularity of the current president. Five years later, it's easy to understand the reasons for the riots and their legitimacy. June can't be thought about as simply the past. We should be considering the general lessons we can take from those events. The emergence of civil society as an active political agent, capable of destabilizing states, establishing social and institutional causes, enforcing its own view on reality, and clearing the path for more, or less, democracy. June marked the birth of an engagement-based social culture, but social participation goes both ways. It isn't less engaged once it stops representing a given political or ideological perspective. NBL isn't any less June than MPL. School Without Party isn't any less June than the students who occupied Brazil's public schools. The rallies of the conservative right aren't any less June than the feminist spring. In its intense sense as strikes by civil society against the political system, June was seen as revolutionary. In its more extensive sense as a month that never ended, June served a conservative function. TITLE PART 1 THE SKY WAS NEVER BLUE During the years of "Lula-ism", one would watch, with renewed perplexity, the alliances between the Workers' Party with notoriously corrupt or regressive players of the national government. From Jos? Sarney to Renan Calheiros, from Severino Cavalcante to Eduardo Cunha, through Paulo Maluf, The conciliation of the irreconcilable illustrated a perplexing logic. That strategy, perceived by the Workers' Party as being the only feasible one within those conditions, consisted of misdirecting conservative groups instead of fighting them. Philosopher Marcos Nobre named it PMDB-ism, that conservative and physiological force that took the parliament and served as a balancing act since the beginning of the redemocratization. That globalization PHILOSOPHER -of the neoliberalism in the 1990s demanded that all countries went towards the center. That "center" being not challenging certain economic policies that were imposed to all countries. From there things were established like the center of a scale. As if saying, "by circling it, you can only go this far." If you lean too Right or Left, you're out of our circle. You can't have power. That's the idea. Both Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Lula could only, at most, give the country a certain sense of meaning without challenging that PMDB-ism. The Lula administration carried out important changes through the sacrifice of the maintenance, and deepening, of that train of thought. Those would be one of the contradictions that would lead to the end of the Lula-led peace in June, 2013. Reasons for the protests were plenty. The many years of economic growth were starting to fade in the background. That period of "economic miracle" based on the increase of minimal wages, family grants, payroll loans, and public investments started to show signs of fatigue. That is when they started. Debates on which direction economy should take in order to keep that growth cycle going. Although the external political environment did help, ECONOMIST -we didn't face too many obstacles. There was an increase in oil and iron ore prices that made things easier both for public finances and for the country's external situation. So the domestic market managed to grow that way, and it worked. But many were worried that that wouldn't last forever, that to do so it would be necessary to develop various sectors. Technology, for example. Things we could export. Taking that as a starting point, a certain idea got traction: the idea that, in order to solve our industrial problems, we would need to develop various policies that would reduce costs to the industrial sectors and, at the same time, give it the means to compete with foreign companies that were flooding our market. Chinese companies and the like. And also give us greater weight in foreign markets. And so a change in direction was imposed, one led not only by the government. That new economic agenda was endorsed by employers' organizations that would later, following that failure, not only claim innocence, but also put the blame on the government, aiming to bring it down. What were those policies? Instead of continuing to expand public investments, they started carrying out a FIESP agenda. I call it that since it's almost entirely defined by proposals mentioned in a 2011 seminar that had the participation of FIESP and other employers' organizations, plus trade unions. They listed things such as tax exemptions, and tax reductions in general, in order to guarantee higher profitability for the corporate sector, high exchange rates in order to increase the price of imports, lowering interest rates in order to ease industry financing, managing electricity rates in order to further reduce industrial costs. Dilma's government started to adopt such measures, known by liberal economists as the "new economic matrix", and they ultimately have no effect. Economist Marcos Lisboa believes that the change in direction for economic policies is even older. It begins in 2008, with an excessive and misguided intervention on the economy by the State. Economic policies went through an inflection, ECONOMIST -especially since 2008. A result of the world facing hardships combined with Brazil thinking it was rich and that would now become huge. That's when they started putting forth excessive projects that ended in failure 5 to 9 years later. Most of the disasters that fell upon Brazil over the last decade had their start back then. The reinforcement of Petrobr?s's monopoly, projects such as Brazil Seven, the widespread distribution of subsidized credit, rulings over national content. It's hard to imagine an agenda that has failed harder than the one started back then. But one must observe June within the global context of accumulated outrage against the money-based tendencies of liberal democracies, moved by a privatization of life that kept on crunching the space of the common. Political systems and financial elites took the reins of democracy, ignoring the interests of the remaining 99% of the population. Taking that global perspective into account, June was, partially, a consequence of the great capitalist crisis of 2008. Or rather, a consequence of the apathy of governments in regards to it. As observed by philosopher Rodrigo Nunes, that which was meant to be the end of unregulated capitalism became, on the contrary, an opportunity to implement austerity-based measures. Banks were rescued, and their debts, socialized. That exposed how much policies representative of both the Right and the Left were seized by corporate and financial interests. That triumphant neoliberalism from the 1990s and the 2000s promised a true paradise, and when a crisis came about instead of it, well, that's an impasse. The way democracy was exercised, the way society was represented, it came crashing down. The crisis plunged the populations of many countries into debt, and reversed the flow of material prosperity experienced over these last few decades, from Latin America to the old Soviet bloc. Uproars such as those from June in Brazil, Occupy Wall Street in New York City, and the indignados in Madrid marked the end of the so-called "moderation era," a mixture of neoliberalism and democracy that was in vogue in western countries since the 1990s. Those democratic uproars from 2011 to 2013 have one thing in common. They were saying that democracy as it was now didn't represent the rioters anymore. Of course, that is tied not only to the decline of the world order that was in place since before 1989, but also to the Internet. It changed the relations between people and their society, politics, and life. The power of the people to build a new world! In Brazil, those protests opposed an armored institutional system that asphyxiated political presence, reducing its power to the bare minimum. That distant kind of citizenship resulted in the abhorrent quality of public services. Social inclusion doesn't necessarily come about through income distribution. Improving public services is also a way to fight inequality. Those big protests ECONOMIST -show a discomfort towards the limitations of what was known in 2006 as the redemocratization social contract. That social contract was the desires of the people of Brazil expressed through the constitution of 1988. Those desires were renewed in every election since then. The desire to establish, in Brazil, a variant of the standard continental European social welfare state. So we established various pension systems, we put the Family Grant into place, among various other projects, such as unemployment insurance. We made it so that the Brazilian State would create revenue and that revenue would reach the people who needed it through various programs that are linked to the risks commonly seen in market economies. But we couldn't properly equip our metropolitan areas. Our public transportation is lacking, our cities are decayed, our sewerage services are poor. There was an increase in income. We had the rise of the new middle class. People renovated their homes, renewed their appliances, installed flat screen TVs... No civilization-wide gain, but still. Then people leave their nice houses and see that everything is wrong. Everything is a mess. The original catalyst, the increase in public transport fares, confirms it. It wasn't just a matter of 20 centavos. The upcoming World Cup and the Olympics in Rio aggravated that feeling of a citizenship scorned. The insane costs of stadiums were incoherent with the precariousness of public services. In addition, many were built without bidding, leaving a stench of corruption in the air. And authoritarianism still bared its fangs through the compulsory removal of the poor. A united people will never be defeated! That torpid democracy then suffered a huge shock. People took to the streets. The activists were, for the most part, young people. Temporary workers and students claiming to be autonomous, who were part of anarchic, communist, socialist, feminist, and LGBT groups. Plus sectors of the black movement, left party youth organizations, the Homeless Movement, and educators' organizations. Everything was threatened. Academia was threatened, ACTIVIST AND CULTURAL PRODUCER -institutionality and bureaucracy, the machine for grinding down party leaderships was threatened, the financial economic system was threatened, and the media was threatened as well, since anything was possible there. The first big middle class crisis was seen in the entertainment industry, especially the post-internet music industry. The second one was the media crisis, where people could tell their stories firsthand and dispute those absolute truths. The media is stealthy, everyone can tell their own version of the story. The idea of a bias mosaic, a mass of media as opposed to mass media. It wasn't a theory being proposed, but rather a buildup that, eventually, as part of that wave, blew up. Instead of the country of carnaval and soccer, we became the country of politics. They used to say every Brazilian was a coach. Now, they're all activists. The beginning of the end of the Lula wave unleashed the transition from culture to politics in the Brazilian people's self image. In so many words, "the giant had woken up." When I think back to 2013, one of the first things that come to mind TEACHER -is me going to one of the schools I work on, at the Brazilian Central. It was Brazil's match in the Confederations Cup. Everybody was in the bar, but instead of talking about the match, they were talking about the protests, the bus wages, about Cabral, about what happened. Then, suddenly, the entire city was talking politics. Involved with politics, giving their opinions on it, arranging to go on rallies together. They started questioning everything. This awakening had its genesis in the protests led by the Free Pass Movement, a social leftist movement demanding the repeal of the decision to increase bus wages in S?o Paulo, and the implementation of free public transportation. If we analyze it from the start of the campaign, we can observe that the MPL made it to every cover of every newspaper in S?o Paulo. PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY, USP -They were very daring, using techniques of social mobilization in ways that were far beyond what was usually done, blocking important streets. It tried and achieved to block roads that others movements didn't dare to due to being too important. The black block happened, that is, destruction of property happening in large scale, from the very first manifestation. So MPL's protests were very daring, and press coverage followed them. PROTEST BLOCKS MARGINAL DO TIET? AND DELAY REACHES 140 MILES RIOTERS VANDALIZE CENTRO AND AVENIDA PAULISTA RIOTS IN S?O PAULO INTENSIFY, MORE RIOTERS ARRESTED AND INJURED The press, at first, presented itself against the protests, and asked for greater police repression in editorials. S?o Paulo's military police, following that request, felt authorized to use even more violence on the protesters. At the same time as that was going on, a different phenomenon took place. Datafolha took to the streets before manifests and before police reactions to gather data. And that's when they found out that the MBL protests were supported by 55% of the people of S?o Paulo. It was clear that the press had summoned the police to use violence against a movement that was way more legitimate than the established powers. Come to the streets against the wage! There was a shift in the way mass media tackled the protests, and that growing trend of people supporting the protests and siding with radical rallies made things blow up. It was building up, but things just escalated fast between the 13th and the following protest, on the 17th, if I'm not mistaken. On that day, the rallies were already massive and went completely out of control of the MPL or any other group that tried to guide or organize such rallies in other parts of Brazil. Its scope became broader, as people taking part in it weren't just Left-leaning youngsters anymore, but all young people, from both sides. That massive amount of people, neither right nor left-leaning, "regular" people in relation to politics, felt summoned by and identified with that act of rebellion. THIS IS BRAZIL LEAVING ITS INERTIA From that point on, June became complex and confusing. In the streets, anti-party cries clashed with anti-fascism cries. Everybody sticking together against the wages, not parties! Red flags, balaclava helmets, colorful banners. A united people, we are without party! The agendas multiplied as the protesters diverged. Democracy! The movement was no longer leftist. Go away, Workers' Party! We don't need you! Some see in June's protests, despite the diversity of ideologies and players, a unity in civil society against the political system. However, we have yet to explain why that unity, not long after, resulted in a split and, later, sharp polarization. Why did that common agenda pro health, education, and transportation led to such a radical split between the left, that defends the universality of such public services, and the liberal right, that claims for minimal state? Probably because, as observed by Wilson Gomes, in June, there was a delicate combination of elements that only converged in an abstract, generic level, and that tended to diverge, politically, economically, and attitude-wise. And so it was. The indignation against the system would soon be channeled into an anti-corruption sentiment that became the political trench that split the country in two. PART 2 NEW POLITICAL CULTURE The June protests did achieve some immediate results. Approximately 70% of Brazilians who life in big cities saw a reduction in bus wages. Some removal proceedings faced heavy resistance and were aborted. In Rio de Janeiro, the bulldozing of Maracan? Village, the Indian Museum, was canceled. The democratizing legacy of June, however, went far beyond that, and manifested itself in the rise of new, egalitarian social movements. The window between 2013 and 2014 had the biggest number of strikes since the establishment of the new republic. The so-called "rolezinhos" was a political movement by young black people from lower-income areas who took to public areas, those usually reserved to the middle class and up. In Rio de Janeiro, the Street Cleaner Group went on a successful strike supported by most of the populace. PHILOSOPHER -That is related to the exacerbation June brought upon. Those undervalued groups have always existed, but haven't always had room to manifest. As soon as the fight went to the streets, it became imperative for people to be on the streets to manifest themselves against that government that intended to keep the less fortunate as less fortunate. Mr. President, sir, Mr. representatives, and to all other present, good afternoon. My name is Ana J?lia, a second year student at the Senador Manoel Alencar de Guimar?es State High School. I am 16 years old and I'm here to talk to you about the occupations. My first question to you is, who does the school belong to? In 2015, second year students mobilized against the closure of public schools in S?o Paulo. The next year, their movement expanded to towns throughout the country. The students protested against PEC 241, amendment that would freeze investments in education for 20 years. They also protested against the School Without Party project, seen as a political maneuver denouncing the politicization of education. Among the egalitarian movements that blew up starting with 2013, the actions of sidelined groups, also known as identitarians, was the most successful in terms of organization and the impact of their actions, though there is criticism to be had over some of its ideas and methods. I have some distaste for that word, "identitarian". SOCIOLOGIST AND FEDERAL DEPUTY -Fights that politicize gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, or territory aren't "identitary", to me. I see them as fights for fulfilling lives, for ways of living that try to draw attention to more traditional and well-established struggles, especially those related to economy, class struggles. We can't discuss healthcare, schools, public security, and transportation without mentioning struggles over our own bodies. Who are the bodies that will have access to those rightful services? I think that's what's changed the most since 2013. The way those struggles have gained a brand new reach. Intersectionality plays a big part in that, a notion that was already elaborated way back between black feminists, but that I'm only seeing becoming part of public debate in Brazil now. The black movement came from over a decade of fundamental achievements, such as the quota system in public universities. Since June 2013, their agenda became based less on legal topics and more on a struggle for recognition, identifying the naturalization and the scope of racial prejudice in the daily social relations of our country. I will not be interrupted! I do not stand for the interruption by congressmen here. I will not stand for men who come here and can't hear the stances of an elected woman. The feminist movement imposed its agenda as the main player in pro-equality fights in Brazil. Its impact is felt, and will change gender relations. LGBT movements also made progress in their struggles for recognition by public policies and representation. In 2018, 45 trans people ran for elective posts. Nine times more than in previous elections. It was also observed the rise of new social movements, both right and left-leaning, seeking direct access to institutional politics aiming to change the system. We need to occupy institutional spaces. Not to reinforce institutionalism, but to challenge it, and create more opportunities to get into the institution. We need to be here because most resources that affect our lives go through institutional, and institutions are led by people who don't care for most of country. The most advanced intelligence can be found autonomously, you can find them around the land, in the rallies. People doing their best to find solutions to their problems. That should guide institutional occupations. But the "giant" would prove to be more complex than once thought. From 2015 on, the new Brazilian political culture was formed by Operation Car Wash, by the anti-Workers' Party sentiment, by Dilma Rousseff's impeachment, by Lula's arrest, and by the sharing of news through digital means. Amidst those events, the space for the Right was set, a space that was disjointed since the end of military dictatorship. The Right made better use of the tools that the collective Bluetooth generation offered them. They told their story better. And Operation Car Wash organized them, served as their basis. ROBBERY, HEALTHCARE, SHAME, JUSTICE ARREST THE CRIME RING'S BOSS, LULA! The new Right resurfaced to talk about corruption. The theme had already been visited in June 2013, but the anti-corruption sentiment would only take roots in Brazil starting with Operation Car Wash. That was the main fuel for anti-Workers' Party sentiment that would lead to Dilma Rousseff's impeachment. It's still early to say whether Operation Car Wash have changed the culture of corruption in Brazil, but its legacy for 2018's elections was undeniable. It made corruption into the main topic considered by voters. I don't believe Operation Car Wash to be partisan at all, but I do think it's political, and that we can only understand many of its ramifications on a political sense. The Operation knows it has to answer to public opinion and the press, that it needs their support to carry on its institutional mission. My issue with Operation Car Wash? JOURNALIST -Denouncing withdrawals? No. I mean, it should be investigated, sure. But it made so that delations became evidence. Denunciation should be a means to obtain evidence. There is an exacerbation in what I like to call, "the toga republic". They decided to rewrite the political trial. A mix of Savonarola with Torquemada. "We are the pure ones, the rest of the world is rotten, "all politicians are the same." Operation Car Wash is antipolitical. It's equanimus in that sense, the most negative sense there is. It "squeegeed" all politicians, turned delations into convictions, which is unacceptable. It's unacceptable in a liberal society, but not in a left wing dictatorship. And in a right wing dictatorship. But not in a liberal society. A part of June's energy was leeched off by Operation Car Wash. As if Operation Car Wash was representative of a part of June that was fighting against the political system. If we see it that way, it boils down to, "may justice be carried out, may the world perish." But at a certain point, that didn't happen. That was observed when Judge S?rgio Moro leaked audio files of conversations between the president, in the exercise of her mandate, and a former president. That was when Moro stopped chasing that end-justifies-the-means justice, and became a political player. Lula's sentence for the apartment in Guaruj? case was scandalous. So, the prosecution claimed in the report that the apartment was the result of three contracts by consortia integrated by Grupo OAS. Did they show any evidence? No. At the time of carrying out the sentence, did S?rgio Moro even touch the contracts, since they are in the report? Rights are shaped. If they aren't, they're nothing. It's content, but, above all, it's shaped. If this is the accusation, then the sentence should be supported by the accusation. S?rgio Moro's sentence has no relation to the accusation. When Lula's lawyers raised his statement embargo, Moro's answer was, "I never said the apartment was resulted of those contracts with Petrobr?s." But if it, indeed, wasn't... He wasn't even the investigating judge. The only information he was privy to were those related to Petrobr?s. He wasn't even a judge. The anti-Workers' Party sentiment that infected much of the populace is a complex phenomenon. It houses, among other elements, the revolt against the true corruption in the Lula and Dilma administrations, the political economical mistakes caused in that period, the electoral fraud of 2015, that would require heavy fiscal adjustments whose need was omitted in 2014's political campaigns, and the lack of self-criticism by the Party in regards to all of that. But the anti-Workers' Party sentiment is also based on interests of sectors of society bothered by the Party's redistributive policies. With its support to the appeals of belittled groups such as women, people of color, and the LGBT community, and from an anticommunist paranoia nourished in the middle of a social democratic rule. The anti-Workers' Party sentiment became one of the dominant feelings in Brazil's politics. A feeling of hatred that gave social support to the controversial impeachment of Dilma Rousseff. PART 3 THE GORDIAN KNOT By God, by my family, by the families of good men, I vote "yes"! Out with Dilma, out with Lula, out with the Workers' Party! With the help of God, for my family, for the Brazilian people, for the evangelists in our country... In memory of my father, Roberto Jefferson, for the truth, for democracy... For S?rgio Moro, for the evangelists, for my Brazil, for my family, "yes"! For the military of '64, today and always. For the memory of Colonel Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, the one Dilma fears the most, I vote "yes"! All who vote "yes", put your hands up! Seeing as how that corrupt Congress, PSYCHOANALIST -how most of those who voted for their "mothers", for their dear "wives", their "kids", for "God" etc. Few voted "for the sake of Brazil". It was always for their families. Fishy from the get-go. Only private interests counted. They voted for the impeachment of a honest president, and seeing as how most of them were accused of corruption, that feeling of anomie, or, as some of my Argentinian friends have said, "psychopathizing Brazil." It generates a feeling of public and civic insecurity, and also of, "oh, so we can do that?" "Anything goes, now?" And we are in times of "anything goes." The fall of Dilma had its start in the 2013 protests, as they weakened the former president and the Workers' Party as a whole. Still, Dilma managed to beat A?cio Neves in a difficult election in the following year. In order to do so, she masked Brazil's economic situation and, soon after winning, had to apply an unpopular fiscal adjustment. Unpopular even within her own party. The opposition made use of the opportunity and, aiming to push Dilma off the cliff, didn't hesitate to sabotage the country through the use of "bomb agendas," that ended up exploding the government's tax conditions that had been deteriorating over the last few years. Worn out by the corruption accusations in Operation Car Wash, losing support of society itself after proposing a fierce fiscal adjustment, having lost the support of business sectors as the economy went down the drain, and, finally, having to face the wrath of the Chairman of the Board, Eduardo Cunha, for the Workers' Party refusal to help him dismiss a lawsuit over his Ethics Committee, Dilma soon found herself cornered. Our flag will never be red! The coordination of the mainstream media with the New Right rallies generated the social support needed for the Parliament to decide to take her down. It is hereby authorized the prosecution of President Dilma Rousseff for crimes committed... Ever since the slowing down of economy of 2011, which, of course, came about due to errors in internal policies but also due to an unfavorable external situation... The oil prices' spike came to an end, the commodities boom. We started to see the state budget drying up. That created the opportunity for a kind of discourse trying to pin the blame regarding the government's central role on policies of income redistribution, public service provision, public investments, and infrastructure, on the collapse that would come later. It's not surprising that tax liabilities and other methods used to mask the fiscal deficit became the core of the impeachment process. The accusations that the impeachment process was based on referred to possible crimes against the LRF, the Fiscal Responsibility Law. In addition to the so-called "fiscal pedalings," the second accusation that served as basis for the impeachment was that of Dilma signing six decrees of supplementary credit facility with a cost incompatible with that of the fiscal target. The first matter is the relevance of such an accusation. Did President Dilma commit a crime against the LRF? Gentlemen, budgets are important laws that should be respected, but they are authorizations of spendings. Article 4 says that it is perfectly possible for such decrees to be issued as long there is a compatibility with the fiscal target. Not a limit. There is a difference between compatibility and limit. A limit is something I can't go beyond. The investigations have proved that all decrees combined didn't spend a single nickel! The 2014 pedalings were nothing but fraud. Lies. Awful. It worked like this. BNDS wrote off on a loan. They thought the grant was still not enough, so in 2000-something, they issued a grant over the grant. But BNDS didn't agree to that. Then the Treasury took on the grant over the grant, that's the Investment Maintenance Program. But then the government said, "I created this grant, "clearly it's accounted for in BNDS, since it loans much less "than it's supposed to, so we have to include it in its assessment. "But the Treasury will only "account for that grant 20 months later." It's insane. There was this public body that already accounted credit for a grant that didn't belong to him, and there was this other public body, the one responsible for the grant, wouldn't account for that money. It's clear fraud. PHILOSOPHER AND ECONOMIST -Dilma did countable, financial, large scale fraud in Brazil, masking the dire situation of public accounts, the various illegal acts that were chronically carried out as a form of financing by the State, that had growing expenses and that wouldn't do anything to fix that. So, it was a serious violation. All of the other governments did the same. Don't say they didn't. Fernando Henrique Cardoso issued decrees just like this one. So did Lula. The so-called grant delay happened in all administrations. And so they keep making up reasons to justify it. False reasons. "Oh, but they should have realized it!" Should they? Why didn't the National Congress report on this? Were all members of the parliament, congressmen, and senators asleep? A splendid sleep. The impeachment has two elements. There's the legal element, so to say. Responsibility law was broken. And a political one. Impeachments aren't judged by a court of judges, or ministers from the Supreme Court. It's the Congress, because there is that element of the political moment and political settlement. But for the impeachment to happen, there must be a crime committed. A law must be violated. And what the Dilma administration did was nothing like that. If you look at other states, yes, maybe you will find governors being as dismissive as Dilma was. But the comparisons made between Dilma's pedalings with those of Lula or FHC made no sense. It's the same difference there is between embezzling money from your company and taking the company's pen home. Where's the president's deceit? Everyone knows she acted knowing of all that was exposed here. Falls upon the deceit of the defendant. People unsure of her actions? Falls upon the defendant. Despite having proof, she will be dissolved. Back in the Middle Ages, if suspected, the person was convicted. Later on, in the 19th Century, no. They were acquitted. Then there's the political aspect. The legal reason could be used if one wanted to, and they did want to. Even if we were to admit that the creative accounting practiced defied tax liability law, and that, technically, the the lawsuit was legal, the political nature of the impeachment is clear. Its main motivation, at least in the political system's eyes, was to "stop the bleeding" caused by Operation Car Wash, paraphrasing the historical recording of the conversation between Romero Juc? and S?rgio Machado. We have to fix this shit, we have to change the government in order to stop the bleeding. The easiest solution would be putting Michel there. It's an agreement, put Michel there, a national agreement. I believe the word "coup" is too strong a word for what happened. I used the term "parlamentada". I call it the "parlamentadas" from 2016. It's a reference to the period of Latin-American history with the "quarteladas". Since there are no more "quarteladas", now they're "parlamentadas". The "parlamentada", is, first and foremost, a movement of self-defense by the political system against justice. It's like they're saying, "we need "to seize power in order to control this, "or else everyone will be arrested. That can't happen." In that sense, the impeachment represents a serious breaking of an unwritten rule of democracy that political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt call "self-control." That is the stance of not using against one's opponents all available constitutional resources for the sake of keeping the political game as a whole functional. In opposition to that, the impeachment represented what law professor Mark Tushnet titles, "constitutional hardball." Forcing an interpretation of the Constitution beneficial to the interests of a certain group. This story, like all stories, has two sides. There is another version of the rivalry between the Right and the Left, the Workers' Party and the Socialist Party of the New Republic of Brazil. In this version of the story, the sequence of events that led to Dilma's impeachment is bilateral. Who started the hardball was the other political group. They used that hardball to the max during the electoral campaign, through various measures. First, by defrauding public accounts to reelect Dilma. Second, lying thoroughly. That's an issue with democracy, size matters. Lying just a little bit isn't the same as lying a lot. And once it was clear she was going for embezzlement... There couldn't be any dialogue. That Workers' Party subgroup lost the main group's trust. The reciprocity of that lack of self-control isn't recent. It's similar to that of Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration. In truth, the first one was PSDB's. The amendment for the election of FHC. Later on, all throughout his administration, the Workers' Party would go against all of the projects proposed to help the country. The Workers' Party voted for "bomb agendas" its entire life. How can a party that spent its life voting for "bomb agendas" complain about A?cio Neves voting against retirement factor, which did sadden me tremendously? The discourse is productive, and necessary. Be that as it may, the impeachment had various consequences for Brazil. Economically speaking, it had some positive effects. But the fact it was led by Eduardo Cunha, a notoriously corrupt politician, who would later be sentenced to over 24 years in prison, plus developments such as the fact that an elected president was replaced by one accused of corruption, and that, despite that, managed to stay in power, plus the fact A?cio Neves, one of the men behind the impeachment who was exposed through a compromising recording and stayed in the Senate regardless... All of that hurt the credibility of an already precarious democracy. PART 4 THE NEW RIGHT AND THE NEW LIBERALS The impeachment, the "parlamentada", or the coup, brought upon an structurally underground player in Brazilian politics. Michel Temer. The living symbol of back room deals, a figure that lurks in the shadows, that the public soon associated with that of a vampire. It's funny the way people's imagination deemed him a vampire, PSYCHOANALIST -or a butler. They say a lot about his place in politics. He's always been there, in the shadows, but those shadows, the real, organic politics, and negotiations behind the curtains, with its corruption, that shadow rose to power. Out with Temer! As observed by philosopher Rodrigo Nunes, Temer might have been the first president in history to flaunt his lack of legitimacy as a virtue. According to him, not having been elected by popular vote meant he was entitled to carry out welfare and labor reforms that were rejected by a majority of the population. That was the agenda of the Brazilian business community that led that movement. Increasing the power of capital over labor. Decreasing as much as possible the cost of the capital's labor. That was the point, economic and politics-wise. It was a delivery to the government, and he delivered it. Brazil managed to put that in power without any extra arguments, no project, no dreams, no relation to history. It's the relinquishing of the beauty of having a country with any level of desire for the sake of having a concrete objective. And nothing more. Temer was the president with the most repudiation in 28 years. Flaunting, also, the supposed honor of being the first active president accused of a common crime, all while surrounded by politicians who could have all been behind bars, were it not for their special jurisdiction. He made through threats of cassation and impeachment thanks to ministers of the Superior Electoral Court and the buyout of the Congress with 15 billion reais taken from the already battered public purse. We observed then a combination of macroeconomic stability with an unpopular agenda that Temer rushed to carry out. June 2013, that great pro-deposing movement, created a void in which the new Right started operating. They were already incubated since the Lula administration, slowly gathering through social media in their infancy. POLITICAL SCIENTIST -The mensal?o made people that weren't very keen on the Workers' Party and Lula to begin with quite dissatisfied. Any of them who voted for Lula were now dead set on voting for his opponent. But it was a very populist administration, so that's another factor. Yes, corruption is important, put so is the government's popularity. That's where June comes in. So a window of opportunity was created for all of those people who were piling up those feelings of dissatisfaction with the Workers' Party, with Lula, with Dilma. Plus investigations on Operation Car Wash kept advancing. It was the culmination of those factors that led those people to feel able to express themselves, even in the streets. We will rid our country of corruption Out with Dilma, out with Lula, out with the Workers' Party. Out with Dilma, out with Lula, out with the Workers' Party. The New Right emerged in the reflux of June's protests and grew stronger with anticorruption movements that mainly affected the Workers' Party. But its rise was also a reaction to the economic crisis. That crisis was, in part, caused by the policies of social spending prevalent in the FHC and Lula administrations. Compromised by the poor decisions regarding economic management, especially in the Dilma administration, social spendings increased the public debt, which eventually became unsustainable. When we look at the FHC and Lula administrations and we observe in the social agenda so much continuity, clearly there is a consensus in society that is larger than any party. The consensus that makes way for that social contract of redemocratization. Essentially, we imagine an election process in which every person is a vote. In general, the rich want financial growth, the poor wants income redistribution, and in this kind of voting environment, the people in the middle, who is poorer than the rich and richer than the poor, they decide. In a society with such immense inequality as Brazil's, the income of the "people in the middle" is very low. So the average voters, those who decide elections, are relatively poor, and vote for the increase of tax burden and income redistribution. It's what I call the social contract for redemocratization. The one who produced that, for the most part, was our own democracy. It wasn't the politicians. They had simply answered to society's demands. Society demanded high tax burden, demanded more public spendings, demanded a balance that led to high interest rates and low growth rates. There is a reaction to that, and that is the New Right. Just as there are many branches of the Left, ranging from liberal socialism to the confiscation of private property, the Right is also vast. In it, conservatives, militarists, and various shades of liberals coexist. I don't get the idea of "conservative in the economy, liberal in behavior." Liberalism is accepting what's different. Maybe the greatest mind of 19th century liberalism was John Stuart Mill. He fought for the inclusion of women, compared the living conditions of women in the 19th century to slavery, fought for the freedom of black citizens, for the end of slavery. To be a liberal is to accept those who think different than you. What kind of liberal would shut down museums? You're either a liberal, or you shut down museums. The foundation of liberalism is the maintenance of individual freedoms. It has a political side and an economic side. In politics, John Stuart Mill's principle must rule above all. "A person is only amenable to society in terms of what concerns others." In other words, no authority, be it the State or members of a social majority, has the right to impose behaviors on people unless such behaviors violate the freedom of others. In such a political scenario, the Brazilian new liberals aren't consensual, and are constantly confused with conservatives. I'd say the New Right, in a sense, go against what Nancy Fraser calls the "Hegemony of Progressive Neoliberalism". They oppose what's "politically correct", oppose the idea of the State being active in culling homophobia, or sexism, or transphobia. In that sense, the ultra-liberals see Olavo de Carvalho-influenced conservatives eye-to-eye. They both agree that those are private matters, that should be solved within one's family, within civil society, that the government shouldn't be involved. That is quite different from what used to be advocated before by the Right itself. Either that Old Right was only concerned with the economy, they were technocratic and didn't care about morals, or there was a concern about such things, but it was exclusive to religious groups and limited to those groups. Usually Christians, evangelists. But not the New Right. It expands the scope. That level of confusion with conservatism can be found in the stances taken by the founder of Brazil's most explicit and well-defined liberal party, the New Party. Jo?o Amoedo claims to be both in favor of the citizens' right to bear arms, but against the decriminalization of drugs and abortions. Economics-wise, the new liberal discourse appears even more extreme than the liberalism as it was seen in parties and economic policies of Brazilian governments post-redemocratization. I'd say they are way more radical. In terms of radically cutting down on laws, being responsible for more privatizations than ever before, in speeds greater than ever before. They've even thought about privatizing goods that no one would even think of privatizing before. An opportune binomial to consider the virtues and limits of the liberal economic perspective is as follows. Poverty and inequality. Jo?o Amoedo has repeatedly stated that inequality isn't the problem that needs to be tackled. He says, "we want to fight poverty, not necessarily inequality. "To fight poverty, we need to increase and create capital, "not redistribute it." In those words may be the main manifestation of the difference between the Left and the Right. There is a debate going on between the Left and the Right as Norberto Bobbio defined. The Left wants more equality, and greater care for vulnerable groups. In exchange for that care, they'd accept a country that grows less, a poorer country, but one with greater equality. The Right, on the other hand, is more accepting of inequality, more accepting of caring less for less fortunate groups, in exchange for a country that, on average, would be richer. That is a social choice. There's no economy weighting in on this. It's a choice. Some prefer to live in a richer country, one with a higher average income, though less equal. Others prefer more equal, though poorer, countries. Some would rather live in Cuba. It's a poor country, but one in which everyone is sort of similar. Some would rather live in the U.S., a country with immense inequality, but on in which, in general, even the poorest are richer than the Cuban middle class. Some prefer something in the middle. A Nordic country. Or France, even with its subtle decay. Not as rich as the U.S., but with a quality of life that offers different benefits. Less working hours, longer vacation periods. That is a political choice by the society. In general, those who believe to be liberal worry more about poverty, about the lack of access to basic services, something that much many go through. They worry about children who have no access to quality education. 50% of the country has no access to indoor plumbing. Some go through terribly hard times. We have so many unemployed, we have people who rely on cash transfers due to having no opportunities. That is poverty, and that's what must be tackled. Another matter is: What is the gap between the richest and the poorest in society? That's inequality. If we could only transfer some of the income of the richest to the poorest, that would help the poorest to be less poor, and would reduce the elite's wealth. Great. But there are ways to fight poverty that might not reduce inequality, but that are also important. Because poverty is an urgent issue to solve. And there are ways to reduce poverty that might increase inequality, and in Brazil's current situation, that might be positive as well, since you're improving the quality of life of those in the bottom. In economy, we can see proof that when the market works, it works wonderfully. Life expectancy in 1800 was 40 years old, and now, it's over 80. An average citizen in a developed European country at the start of the 19th century made 400 to 600 dollars a year. One and a half dollar per day. Now, they make 40 to 60 thousand. Their income multiplied by 100. Of course, we recognize the advances of market economy, but we also see its flaws. How can you guarantee equal opportunities? How can we turn that wealth growth into equality and greater care for the more vulnerable? The virtues of the free market are irrefutable. Over these last few centuries, our wealth and life expectancy multiplied in most sectors of humanity. But the limits of the free market are just as evident. One doesn't necessarily need to fight inequality in order to improve the lives of the less fortunate. But it might be impossible, from the perspective of economy, to grow sustainably without reducing the privileges of the higher classes, eliminating certain benefits of certain sectors with the State, and advocating tax reforms that taxes more heavily those with higher incomes. Besides, inequality, on its own, is harmful. Inequality is anti-democratic, as wealth equals political power, and makes way for social unrest, which leads to violence. PART 5 FEAR AND REACTIONARY UTOPIA The history of informed conservatism dates back to the 18th century. In that "moderate" version, conservatism is a position more reliant on skepticism, that works as a counterpoint to utopical political ideas, that believe to be able to radically change people and society, often to disastrous results. But the emerging conservatism in Brazil is, for the most part, from different origins. It's based on religion and dogma. Its stances are reactionary, and it manifests itself heavily in what is known as culture wars. Gender ideology is mocked in moral debates. The persistent belief in the existence of a sort of pro-LGBT elitism serves as an alibi that masks their fear when faced with the full realization of modern society. The idea is that we are in a "moral chaos" in which there are no more values to be upheld. We can't differentiate right from wrong anymore, but we will be able to if men are men, and women are women. It's a common sight among contemporary conservative ethics writers that initial diagnosis. "We are all lost. We no longer know "what criteria to use. We must return to..." Then they might say, "to Aristotle," or "to Kant..." The end of that sentence doesn't matter. But we must "return" to some point in history in order to recover criteria from it that would allow us to, once again, tell right from wrong, and do so universally. Doing so to get us out of the chaos that post-modernists got us into. That definition tends to end on that very clich?d note. Blessed be Jesus Christ! Blessed be the Christian culture! The key to understanding the retail fights between the Queer Museum, lecture by Judith Butler and transvestite Jesus Christ, isn't in surface-level arguments. The true arena for this conflict is a bit deeper. It takes place in the emotional psyche of people, and boils down to a conflict between the modern and the pre-modern, the open world and the closed world. As noted by trans intellectual Helena Vieira, this conservatism is a refusal to accept the death of old traditions. I like to see conservatism as a kind of melancholy. It's a feeling of those who don't want to advance, those who can't understand that the world has changed. And since they can't understand that, they feel lost and wish for the regression of the world back to a time when things "made sense," according to that person's beliefs. We live in ambiguous times, in which the old world of traditions feels threatened as it gazes upon a new, expanding, world. In that intermediate point, to quote Gramsci, a variety of morbid symptoms manifest themselves. Every step society takes towards full acceptance of all lifestyles, all identities, sexualities, and genders, a reactionary movement takes shape to try to restore the normative values of tradition. The white, male, straight supremacy. The world of tradition is one in which principles are assured by a solid foundation. The God of monotheisms, whose rules are made into commandments that man must follow. That world of tradition loses in freedom what it gains in psychological comfort. In it, all are born knowing what is right and what is wrong, and what they should do in all aspects of their lives. The modern world challenges that belief. The modern times questions all dogma, and does so by undermining its primordial basis, the monotheist God. Modern times are those described by Jordano Bruno, Coppernicus and Galileo. Through science, explaining the world with proof. Through exploring and its cultural decentralizations. Through Kantian reasoning, through Nietzsche's superman, through the industrial revolution and technological development. The ideal of the modern world is liberty. In it, all possibilities are accepted as long as they don't violate the freedom of others. What one gains in freedom, one loses in psychological comfort. That's why so many can't stand modern times. It anguishes them. Makes them feel threatened regarding their defining truthisms. How can the freedom of others be so deeply disturbing? I'm fond of a very simple explanation by psychoanalyst Christian Dunker. "Because they're afraid." It sounds so obvious that it might elicit a "that's it?" reaction. But it's a lot. We have a Right that is radically opposed to gay marriage, and to this day, I don't understand why. I mean, the concept of abortion touches up notions of life and such, drug abuse is an issue that affects society as a whole, children, dos and don'ts, blurred lines and such. But why would people care about what two people do in private? We are currently seeing a rise of this reactionary Right, and the most violent of them, today represented by the "bolsonarism". It's like there was a "combo" of beliefs. You have to be anti-LGBT, anti-abortion, anti-drugs, and, curiously, pro-death sentence. Which I also find to be a stupid, incoherent circus. Abortion is a no-no, that kills people, but I do want to kill people after they're already grown. It is impossible to understand the rise of the New Conservative Right in Brazil without talking about Olavo de Carvalho. His active online presence during these last two decades was decisive for the propagation of the reactionary sentiment. There are excellent things to be found in Olavo de Carvalho's books, and there are absolutely putrid things. I've recently gotten a hold of a copy of "The Collective Imbecile". There are some fantastic passages there, but it just so happened that I opened the book and randomly found something like, "Graciliano Ramos was repulsed by eating "anything prepared by his gay cook. "But I ask: why can't we be disgusted by gay people?" In my reality, I can't even understand the reason for the question. Why is it even questionable, whether it's acceptable to be disgusted by homosexuals? Is there room for debate on whether there is an excess of "gay patrolling" in cultural production? I think that's acceptable. If feminists exaggerate, if LGBT defenders exaggerate, those are debates that can be made. But when you make that into a divide to classify people and to qualify beliefs, then I'd say things went south. They follow a bad train of thought. You're promoting intolerance. Brazil's conservatism is more than a mere moral agenda. The fear it motivates spreads through social experience as a whole, creating a widespread desire for restoration of order. Ever since the days of Thomas Hobbes, we know that the State begins as fear. People's longing for a government, for a central entity capable of preventing a war between everyone, goes to show how fear has the power to stabilize society. That is why fear is an element manipulated by those in power. The more fear there is, the more order there is. As noted by philosopher Vladimir Safatle, fear reproduces the conditions of the human race that gave birth to the religious view of the world. That creation was meant to relieve insecurities over the violence of nature through the creation of authority figures. The religious view lives on in modern politics as a longing for an authority considered capable of pacifying the fundamental insecurity when faced with the disorder of things. That is a form of politics from 60 thousand years ago. It's "horde politics". During crisis in the order of reality, in the level of violence in the world, it would be possible to have a regression to those primordial structures to political order. Groups, territories, a psychological territoriality, paranoid projections of the enemy, the right to violence, and the authoritarian, paternal management of that group. That's Freud's "horde". A regression back to the horde. Jair Bolsonaro symbolizes that regressive desire for an authority figure. The demand for a tyrant father can be seen when democracy fails. People then believe that that "father" can restore the lost order, and people take the risk that, instead of reestablishing law, he might impose order. It's an interesting notion. The idea of "order" in Brazil. The idea that "order" is an authoritarian element divorced from "law". It's an issue in Brazil. This idea that order is a direct right from political actions from a certain lordship over society, without the involvement of the social contract. That is a typical consequence of the backwardness and Brazil's post-colonial nature that doesn't gel with the social integration of liberal capitalism since the industrial revolution, or with the contractual relationship between classes. Even with the violence of the capital over society, some forms of intermediation are vital for the reproduction of capital. Our forms of production and reproduction of capital are tied to slavery, the ultimate, most absolute form of exploiting. One can expropriate everything to Brazil. The order is tied to that. Maybe a given sector is more powerful than all other contracts in the country. But that is "order". From time to time, due to historical fragility, that kind of crazy thought gains strength. The law is universal and egalitarian. All are subject to it. It's the belief in its efficiency that measures a democracy's welfare. Order, on the other hand, is vertical and authoritarian. Those who carry it out are above the law, and aren't subject to the same principles as the rest. In Freudian legend, in "Totem and Taboo," the father had an abusive, tyrannical power. He was the strongest, physically. And so his children realize that, together, they can bring him down, so they kill their father. And, so they wouldn't fall to a state of anomia, in which everyone would fight among themselves, they establish the basic law that rules over subjectivity: having access to all women except for their father's wife, the law prohibiting incest. That's the Freudian fable. He didn't intend for it to be exactly as he narrated. Though the father allows himself to do things he forbid, such as drinking, staying up late, unlike his children, it's okay, because he tells them they'll eventually get those privileges. Putting a limit on one's enjoyment is different. You can't do whatever you want. You can't disobey civil laws, nor can you exploit your own lust, things that are with every person from birth. When that father starts reveling in his privileges, claiming that he is not subject to laws like the others are, he plants in his children's minds that fantasy of, one day, being the same as their father. FINAL PART THE SPOILS June had thrown the first stone. Following that, the displayed corrupted entrails of the political system shook the traditional Left, Central and Right parties. PMDB, the ultimate symbol of this failed system, was the biggest loser in the 2018 elections. PSDB sunk deep after the charges against A?cio Neves, and Geraldo Alckmin's usual behavior. The Workers' Party was upheld by most voters as being the greatest villain overall. Anti-Workers' Party sentiment was one of the decisive aspects of public opinion. Within a few years, it resulted in Dilma Rousseff's impeachment, Lula's arrest, and Fernando Haddad's defeat. The rejection of corruption might have been the elections' main theme. Operation Car Wash had effectively taken down once invulnerable figures and shook the corrupt power structure. But it's still too soon to judge the practical implications of OC over the culture of the system. The Congress had its largest renewal since the redemocratization began. Many of the spokesmen for traditional politics were not reelected. The elected Congress has a conservative stance. There was a revolution in the electoral campaigns. Not due to the end of corporate financing, but because social media replaced television as the dominant media. Within this context of distrust regarding institutions, including the press, chat groups produce an spontaneous effect that disarms people. That spontaneity, as it arose, is, for the most part, fake. Regulating this new media is one of the main political hurdles of our time. At the end of the day, Brazil's liberal democracy was deemed a failure, and the Center, its main symbol, collapsed. The traditional Center, Center-Right an Center-Left parties saw themselves becoming unfeasible due to their involvement with corruption. The then-ruling Left was demonized. The one who enjoyed the spoils was Jair Bolsonaro, the Radical Right's candidate. Translation: Marcelo Gouv?a SUBTITLES ETC FILMES
