[***] [Boy]: You lost, Miller? Huh? You deaf, too? Trailer park's that way. Yeah, keep chirping, bud. What, you didn't think we'd hear that shit, man? -Yeah, I didn't say anything. -Bullshit. What you going to do about it? Shut your mouth. Like your dad shuts his mouth? What did you just say? Say that again. Around all that prison dick. [grunts] [struggling] [police sirens blare] Yo, yo, yo... Get the fuck out of here, Tyler! Run, man! [Officer]: Are you serious, Miller? You pull this today? Face on the ground! Okay! Easy! I'm not fighting you back! You Millers think you can do whatever you want. [***] [turns off water] [water rushes again] Al! Al! Come have a drink with us. Can't today, Len. Come on. One drink. -I have dinner with Brandon. -So what? Bring him. 'Bout time the little shit learned how to drink, anyway. He's 17, Len. Doesn't need much teaching. All the better. Let's sneak him in. Yeah, I would, but, um... it's been a year today, so... Yeah. Right, of course. Hey, listen, uh... Lindy really wants you guys to stop over. We got one of them new entertainment units. We got Oilers games, stuff like that. I mean, it'd be good to just sit down and talk, you know? Yeah. I mean, it's going to be summer time, and you'll be gone, and we won't see you. Another time, for sure. Hey, listen, you know, if, uh... it doesn't have to be everybody neither. If you just want somebody to talk to... you know? [sighs] Hey, how 'bout today? Why don't you work on getting jobs, you little shits? [Man]: Hockey player shoots a grizzly, and the whole damn country gets their panties in a bunch. Fucking libs, eh? Let the boys play the game, you know. This too. Yeah. [TV plays quietly] [Newscaster]: Today marks the one-year anniversary of a tragedy here in Castlegar. Eli Balkoff, a prominent youth within the local community, was struck and killed in a traffic incident last year. It was at this gas station where the incident occurred. An intoxicated local man robbed the store and fled in his truck, where only a few metres down the road, a 15-year-old Eli was riding his bicycle home. Now Eli's parents, owners of the local pulp mill, Helen and Jim Balkoff, are turning this tragedy into something good. [Helen]: My son was a public servant in the making. My husband and I would like to continue that legacy, and we're very proud to begin construction on the Eli Balkoff Centre for Youth to help misguided youths find their way. [Newscaster]: Keith Miller, the driver of the truck that struck and killed Eli, was known to police and had been released on bail earlier that year for previous drug-related offenses. Miller was sentenced to 15 years and six months in prison. Brand? [answering machine]: You have one message. [beep] Al, it's Darryl. We need you down here again. [door buzzes] [Darryl]: Come on, let's go. You need to get a cell phone. [Alison]: Sorry, Darryl. Just got your message. Thanks for coming in. What'd he do this time? Oh, you know, another scrap. Took some doing, but the other kid's not going to press charges. Al... I can't keep doing this. I know. Thank you. [Chief]: Saves us a lot of paperwork anyway. Got enough of that with your name on it already, don't we, Brandon? Can I go? -Yeah, you can go. -All right. [Chief]: You know, one of these days, you're going to do some real damage to someone, smart ass. You'll have bigger problems than just paperwork, I can guarantee that. -Can you? -Yeah, keep it up. You'll be sharing a cell with your old man in no time. Fucking asshole, man. Talking shit. [Alison]: Stop it. [yelling indistinctly] Why you got to be such a shit? -Fuck those guys. -Fuck those guys? Fuck those guys. -Those guys let you walk. -They didn't let me do shit. They didn't let you do shit? Then how you out here with me? Huh? Just open the door. Dad made the front page. You want to be next? You're right on track. Fuck. Oh, wow. You get a key cut? We just heard about Brandon, so... Hi. Hey. -You good? -Yeah, you okay? Oh, yeah. I didn't know what day it was. You knew we had dinner. Look, why don't we just visit him? I mean, he's in jail. He's not dead. He had it coming, Ali. He's a fucking goof. He was talking shit about Dad. God, you sound so much like Dad right now. Don't say that shit. You do. Come on. I'm nothing like him. I stick up for my family, for my friends. I did the right thing. If you did the right thing, then I wouldn't be picking you up from the police station. Oh, fucking shit, man, I can't stand this. If some guy is standing there, fucking with us, you just want me to do nothing? I'm just going to sit there and let somebody sit there and chirp at me, chirp at me? Like, I fucking reacted. Who loves you? Eh? I do... but I don't know what to do anymore, 'cause we keep having this conversation over and over. What, do I have to sit you down and lay some ground rules? No, come on. Ali, nobody asked you to be the parent. Who's it going to be, then? It's me and you, remember? Four months until you're 18... and what does that mean? That Darryl can't help you anymore. That means... that means real jail. What the fuck do you care if I go to jail? The fuck I care? You're fucking leaving, remember? -You're leaving. -That's not set in stone. That's set in stone! It's set in stone because the minute I turn 18, I don't need a guardian anymore, so you can be free to take off, do whatever you want! Even if I do, even if I do, that doesn't mean you're kicked to the curb. I've been saving up money for the two of us. Bullshit, Ali! Bullshit! That's what you're doing! What am I supposed to do? You're not making this easy for me! All I'm doing is picking you up every time you make a stupid fucking mistake. I am trying here, Brand. I'm fucking trying. What the fuck do you think I'm doing? Tyler, where you going? We're, uh, headed out. Well... what about dinner? Just grab something with my huge allowance. Coming home tonight? I don't fucking know. [opens a beer can] [beer splatters] Fuck it. [dials] [phone rings] [Charlene, on phone]: Hello? [sultry] Hi. Hi. Are you drunk? Maybe. [chuckles] Maybe yes. You want to drunk with me? Oh... hon', you know I can't. But I'm all... frisky. Frisky? [chuckles] Yeah, I like it when you say that. Frisky. After this custody shit with Sophie's over, okay? Earl's on my ass about everything. Oh, come on, Char. I need some company. You know we can't. Okay. [sighs] Ali? Yeah? I've got to go. Sure. [fire crackles] [rock music playing] [car approaching] [Brandon]: Fuck, whose car is that? Oh, it's fucking Earl! He's supposed to be bowling. [Brandon]: Well, he's not. -[Earl]: Where the fuck are you? -Dad... You piece of shit. You fucking rape my daughter, you piece of shit? I'm her boyfriend, you fucking idiot. Hey! Hey! [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello? [Darryl]: Hey, get some clothes on. We're coming over. What time is it? Al... Something's happened. I need you to get up. Darryl? Alison! Get your ass up. Okay, fuck. Is Brandon there? I don't know. Find out. We'll be there soon. [kettle whistling] [car drives up] [knocking] Morning, Miller. -[Darryl]: Is Brandon around? -Nope. You know where he might be? I do not. Have you spoken to him at all this morning? [Darryl]: Al? Can we come in? So you're sure you don't know where he is? I'm sure. [Chief]: Well... we talked to Sophie Hinters. You know Earl Hinters, Sophie's dad? I do. Well, we found him this morning. He's dead. What? [Chief]: And according to Sophie, Brandon was involved in an altercation with Earl before it happened. The chief found her unconscious when he arrived at the scene. Earl's car's missing, too. You think Brandon did it. We're just looking to find him is all. Was hoping you'd have an idea. I don't. You are his legal guardian, are you not? Yeah, he sleeps here. I feed him. Whatever else is his business. Real tight-knit, huh? If you do hear from him, will you let us know? We just need some information. Where is Sophie now? She moved back in with Charlene. [Charlene]: Come on. He wasn't good at much, but he sure knew how to hit. What happened? Earl happened. He got all liquored up bowling.. came home early, caught them mid-fuck. He just lost it. He almost took Sophie's head off. By the time she woke up, cops everywhere, Earl in the kitchen. I'm so sorry, Char. Fuck Earl. I'm just glad Sophie's okay. Did she say if anybody else was there? Just Brandon. Hey. The police are going to find him, and then we're going to figure this out, okay? Do you think he could have done it? I know it's hard to believe. It's just not looking good right now. I'm just being honest. All right? You said the same thing about your father, like he wasn't a dealer. You know you did. I just think that you should be prepared this time. He's not Keith. He was the only one there, Ali, and... you know how he gets. Got to get ready for work. Don't worry, I'll be quiet. Hey, come on... I'm sorry, Mr. Balkoff. What are you doing? Yeah, I can see you're eating your fucking lunch. Would you roll the window down, please? Roll it down! This is stupid, you sitting here, Al. Could really do without a lecture today, Len. You can't sit here like this. You've got to do something. He's your brother. He can sort himself out. What? "He can sort..." God, I am so sick of this woe-is-me bullshit. I told you, I could do without a lecture today, Len. I didn't ask for your goddamn opinion, okay? Oh, you didn't ask for my opinion, but you're going to get it. Get out of the car. Not getting out of the car. Get out of the car. I'm not getting out of the car, Len. You think I won't drag you out? Get out of the car, I said! Come on! Let go of me! Look, you think because your old man's not here to slap some sense into you, that I won't do it? Huh? You think Brandon is a murderer? Do you? Huh? I don't know. No, you don't know. You don't know. He was there, Len. You know how he gets. Look... Earl was a shithead, Al, and a crook. Maybe he didn't deserve to get what he got, but he was on everybody's list around here, so you don't know. How do you think he pays for that fucking car of his, huh? Hard work? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's happening again, isn't it? Look, Al, I know your old man's not high in your books right now. I get that. He screwed up. He ran over Balkoff's kid, Len. God, Al, would you let me finish, for God's sakes? Yes! He fucked up. He fucked up real bad, but that's on him. That's not on Brandon. Look, you've got to-- you've got to pull your head out of your own shit and get it together, because if they find him first, they're going to string him up. You know this. You're all he's got. I know. Plus... there's plenty other people got that "hating the Millers" shit down pat already. There's no need for it. You're a real asshole, Len. I know. Worst part is, I'm right. Thank you. You got it, kiddo. [rings desk bell] How are you? What's up? Um... were you working last night? Why? Just looking to get some information. About what? A regular... called Earl. The guy who died last night. He was here, right? Well, uh... somebody said that he left early. Do you know why? Heard he got a phone call from someone. Phone call from who? I don't know. Well, maybe the person working last night would know. Do you have a staff list or something? Look, I don't even know who you are. I can't just give you information on the staff. Oh, shit. Okay. Wednesday... 2:00 to 10:00. Freya. Which one of you are Freya? [phone rings] [Young girl on phone]: Yeah ? Uh, yeah, hi, is Freya there? She just left. Left where? The game, obviously. Everyone's going, except me. [clears throat] Who is this? Uh... it's okay. [cheering] [cheering] Freya? Yeah? Can I talk to you for a sec? You're Miller's sister, right? Who? Miller's sister... the dyke. Can I just talk to you? Hey, don't touch her. There a problem here, Freya? There's no problem. I wasn't fucking talking to you. It's fine, D. Can you just fucking talk already? Okay. Were you working at the bowling alley last night? Yeah. I'm just looking for some information. Do you know who called Earl? Why you want to know? I'm just curious. Is this about your brother? I'm not talking to you, okay? I don't know who called, okay? I told the cops the same thing. I mean, some guy just called him, and then dude lost his shit and ran out the building. You sure you don't know who it was? Any ideas at all? She's sure. I'm sure. Okay. Hey, Al. Al... Hey. Hold this for a second. Alison, wait up. Alison, wait up. Al, I'm on call, come on. What do you want, Darryl? Hey, would you just stop for a second? What do you want? I know it sounds like I think Brandon did this, but I'm just following what we have to go on here. Yeah, and his history wouldn't have anything to do with it, would it? I can't deny it isn't a consideration, Al, but it's not the only one. Look... [exhales] I shouldn't even be telling you this, obviously... but there may have been someone else there last night... at Earl's. We found footprints at Earl's front window. Do you have any idea who it was? I was hoping you might know. Look, when he left, he was with Sophie and his friend, Tyler. After that, I don't know. Tyler? Okay, yeah, I'll see if I can talk to him. Oh, shit. Come here. What? -Just come on. -What's wrong with you? What are you doing? It's the chief. He hasn't stopped since he found Earl. I really don't need him seeing us talking. Look, hey... Brandon's fingerprints were found on what we think is the murder weapon... Blunt force to the temple with the base of a bowling trophy. Listen, Sophie said Earl burst in and attacked Brandon, but we need a witness to back that up, so if you can think of anybody else, just tell me... because it could mean the difference between murder and self-defense. Look, obviously I didn't tell you any of this. If you hear anything from Tyler, just... call me. Hey. Thank you. Yeah. [indistinct voices] Haven't heard from you all day. Where were you? I'm here now. Did you just disappear? I'm sorry. Is Sophie here? Yeah, she crashed early. Where were you? Um... I found out that someone else might have been there last night. God... how do you smoke cloves? What are you doing? What do you mean? What, you're a detective now? No, I'm just... [lights cigarette] it's just... want to figure some things out. Like what? You're not a cop, Ali. You're just going to get in the way. I'm worried Brandon's going to take the fall. And if he did it? Then he turns himself in before anyone else gets hurt. I've just got to find him. Yeah, how you going to do that? You going to make flyers? Don't be like that. No, I am serious. I don't want to see you get into something you can't back away from. Do you know something? I know your family's not very popular right now. When have we ever been popular? This is serious shit, Al. Earl was murdered, all right? If this was Sophie, you'd be doing the same thing, and you know that. You would. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm worried about you. You don't have to be worried about me. I'll be fine. Hey. Don't go. Come on. You just got here. It's fine... but I can't stop thinking about this, so I wouldn't be good here tonight. Look, just tell Sophie that I'd really like to talk to her at some point. I will, I will. Just come inside. I've got to go. [door opens] Evening. You can't just walk in here. Oh, you're one to talk. Were you just at Earl's trailer? Why are you asking me that? Well, that's the wrong answer, isn't it? [Darryl]: Someone saw you, Al. What were you doing? I just wanted to see it. See what? I just wanted to see it for myself, understand it. And what did you find out? What is it? I don't know. Don't lie to me. I'm not lying to you. All this trouble... for an art project. You don't think that looks a little suspicious, like maybe you're trying to hide something else from us? I'm not trying to hide anything from you. Well, being as you just went through a crime scene, I'm having a tough time believing you. Darryl, check the house please. Yup. I knew your mom, you know. She was a screw-up, too. Fruit doesn't fall that far, does it? Not as bad as your dad, mind you. It's no wonder she left. It's all clear, Chief. So... we just built some trust, Miller. That's how that works. You tell me the truth... I believe you. Don't let us find you messing around again in places you shouldn't. The next time you need to see something for yourself, don't. Understand each other? Yes. Darryl. [footsteps approaching] [door opens] Hey. I, uh... saw that your mom's car wasn't out there. Yeah, I think she left somewhere this morning. That's cool, 'cause I actually... [clears throat] wanted to talk to you. Anything on Brandon? No... Um... but I went to the trailer park last night. You went there? Yeah. I found this. Does that mean anything to you? Can you think of anything? Yeah, Leland wears there. Leland? He's punk. Do you know why he would have been there? He's the guy that Brandon beat the shit out of. Know where I might find him? Tyler's girlfriend, Freya, might know. Her and Leland used to date. [woman]: Oh, my god You have got to be kidding me. What are you doing here? I'm showing support for Charlene and Sophie. [laughs] And you think that's appropriate, huh? How dare you show your face after what your brother did. He's missing, Helen. He's not guilty. It's Ms. Balkoff to you. I'm so sorry about Eli. Don't you talk about him. Leave my son out of this. We're here to show true support... from those who know what it's like to lose someone. Support that counts for something. Come on, girls. What's up, slit? What the fuck are you doing here? You even allowed to be here? I did go here once. Yeah, but you don't anymore. No, I don't. That's very astute. What's up? Can we talk? [Boy]: Come talk to my dick when you're done! Where'd you get that from? I found it at Earl's trailer. Look, I don't want any trouble. I'm not the cops, Freya... but I could talk to them. So let's try this again. Do you know who called Earl at the bowling alley? [exhales] Yeah, it was Leland. You sure? We dated a while. But you don't anymore. No. With Tyler now. Why wouldn't you have told the cops about Leland? I don't want to be associated with anything. I mean, Leland was a really bad scene, and... I got caught with shit I shouldn't have. Police are the last thing I want to deal with right now. Well, do you know what he told Earl? No. Uh, whatever it was really pissed him off. Right. He live at the trailer park? Thrums. Where at? Come on, I'm not going to say that you told me anything, okay? I'm not going to say anything to anybody. I didn't give you that. Leland doesn't do visitors. Why not? He's a dealer? Where have you been? Graduated. You talk to Tyler? Oh. Hello? Hello? Oh! Shit... Char? [car approaching] [Alison]: No, no, no, no... No, no, no, no! [Chief]: Engine's still warm. She can't be far. Get a perimeter going. [Darryl]: We're not sure what's happening yet, Chief. [Chief]: I warned her, Darryl. Find her, and bring her in. Yes, sir. Chief! You'd better come look at this. [dogs barking] [distant country music playing] [Len, muttering] Who the fuck do they think they are? Son of a bitch... Little pussy, I'll fucking smack him in the... Hey, Len. Hey, Al. Hi. Hey. Troy cut you off again? Ah, asshole. Thinks I'm a fucking pussy. I'm no fucking pussy, Al. I know. You're goddamn right I'm not. I know. Hey... Len? You got some beers at home? Yes, I do. Give me your keys. You drive. Yep. Come on. [door rattles] Char? We're closed. Just a question. What is it? Do you know if Charlene was working today? I know she was supposed to. She didn't show up? Nope. Didn't answer her phone neither. Okay. [locks door] Oh, man... [Len snores] [dials] [Charlene, voicemail]: Hey, this is Charlene. Can't get to the phone. Leave a message. [hangs up] [dials] [Darryl]: Tarasoff. It's me. [Darryl, whispered]: Hold on. Darryl? Al, we're bringing in officers from Trail and Nelson. How did you know I was there? [Darryl sighs] They're talking about bringing Tactical in from the coast. Darryl, how did you know I was there? Oh, we didn't. The Chief got a tip that Leland may have been the witness at the trailer park. Yeah, he was. He was also the one that called Earl at the bowling alley. How did you know that? Do you think he was trying to set up Brandon? You know, for the fight, or...? Hold on, hold on. Where are you getting this information from? [motorcycle draws close] Alison, come in, please. If you share what information you have, we can work this out. Tyler! Alison? [starts engine] [tires squealing] Ty! [pants] Is he all right at least? Al? Why are you chasing me? You wouldn't stop! I was getting chased! Yeah. Are you with him? We're safe. Stay out of it. He's my brother. Give me something. He doesn't want you involved... and hey, leave Freya out of it, will you? She's going through enough shit already. Shit. -Hey. -What? Where's everybody partying tonight? How bad do you want to know? Just tell me, 'kay? How 'bout a case? Tell me now, and I'll get you next time. I'll get you next two times. [Toque guy]: How about a case, and you show us your tits? How about a handjob while you're at it? Fuck off and tell me. Get the fuck off me! Up Snob Hill, Kristy Peterson's place. We'd be going, too, if we had a boot. Piece of shit kid. Hey. Just this. Don't move. Police are out looking for you all over town, and I got you, so just don't move. You don't know what you're doing. The hell I don't. Dave... you know me. Yeah, I do, and you're a Miller. And I didn't do anything. Shut your mouth. Hello? This is Dave Foster from Twin River Liquor. I have Alison Miller here. It's not even loaded. Hey! Len, wake up! If you're so innocent, why are you running? Len? Len! [engine starts] What the fuck? Len! [door rattles] Lenny! Lenny, you drunk fuck, wake up! Hey, Dave. [engine revs] I'm proud of you, Al. Thanks, Len. [loud music playing] [loud music playing] [loud music playing] Hey! Why the fuck are you here? What the fuck? [Alison pants] [Guy]: Open the door! Tyler was in town today. What did he tell you? Nothing! He... He mentioned you by name. Just... fucking stay out of it! I can't stay out of it. This is my brother. He's in some shit, and I don't know what it is, so can you please just help me? Alison... I don't know what to fucking tell you. Just tell me where he is! [banging on door] Pass Creek, okay? Pass Creek, above the falls. They ditched Earl's car up there. Open the fucking door! Get out. Go! [Dustin]: Freya, move! [Freya]: Dustin! Fuck off! [Alison]: What are you doing? Fuck, what are you doing? Fucking... get off of me! [Dustin]: Where are you going? The fuck are you doing? Party just got started! Let... go of me! You like it on your back, don't you? [grunting] I like it rough, too. Ow! Fucking piece of shit! [vehicle approaching] [engine turns off] [exhales] [starts hyperventilating] Tyler? [bursts out sobbing] [branch snapping] Brandon? [gunshot] [gunshot] [screams] [gunfire] [gunshot] [Alison grunts] [screams] [panting] [gasping in pain] [car engine revs] [gasps in agony] [car approaching] [panting] [grunts] [gun cocks] [woman]: You can stay right there! Debbie! I need your help out here! I found her in the field. [Alison cries out in pain] What the hell happened? I didn't shoot her. Now, just... just take this. Come on. Come on. Okay. Okay. There. [Alison grunts] Debbie, get the kit. God... [Debbie]: This is Keith's girl. The kit! Okay. Okay... Oh, no... [gasps] Debbie, hurry up! [door creaks shut] [Debbie, in other room]: Well... Police have roadblocks everywhere. What? [Debbie]: She is in something bad. Was there anything about who shot her? [Debbie]: Nothing. No one's talking anyway. Oh, Jesus, Ruth. What do we do with her? We can't keep her here. Where else is she going to go? I don't know, but she can't stay here. [Ruth]: Who's going to know she's here? I don't know, and neither do you. For Christ sake, this ends one way for us if word gets out. Oh, you're awake. Uh, good. Are you hungry? You should be. I made some soup. How long have I been asleep? Since yesterday. We didn't think that the hospital was in your best interests. How do you two know who I am? We knew your mom. I don't recognize the two of you. You were just a kid. I wouldn't imagine you would. Is that how you know my dad? It's a small town. Everyone knows Keith. Guessing that field out back has a lot to do with it, too. [Debbie]: Nothing that concerns you. We're, uh, we're growers. That's enough. She has a right to know. No, she has no rights at all in this house. Can't afford another Miller charity case. [Ruth]: Either that, or she was dead, Deb. [Debbie]: Just get rid of her, soon as she's able. This comes back to us, I swear to God... 'Kay. Here. This have to do with my dad robbing that gas station? Why don't you eat first? I won't be staying long. [grunts in pain] Keith owed a lot of money to a lot of folks, and some of those folks were the kind that you wouldn't want to be owing money to. They started threatening him. With what? With you guys. How do you know all this? Well, Keith knew what we... did, and so... after your mom left... we-- we put him in touch with the right people, like he wanted. We didn't know he was using, though. That came back on us. He used to talk about you kids a lot. I'm sure he did. He did! Showed us pictures, and... He was real proud of you. I know you don't want to hear this, Alison, but... your dad was trying to protect you that day. He dragged that kid under his truck for a full block, screaming. I don't care what he was trying to do. He left us alone... just like Mom. A child should never pay for the sins of the parent, but they most certainly will. Eli Balkoff's death was a tragedy. I mean, Keith did a lot of bad things. You've got a lot of reasons to hate him... but you can't let his past be who you are now. I mean, your mom leaving the way she did, that set him off in a bad way, and it wasn't all her fault. Keith... is a hard man to like... but he would do anything for you, anything for his family. I think that you are alike in that way. You heard about Brandon? I want to help you, Alison. I think we owe you that much. [phone ringing] [Charlene, voice mail]: Hey, this is Charlene. I can't get to the phone. Leave a message. Fuck... [dials] [phone ringing] [Darryl]: Tarasoff. Hey. Al? Hey! Where are you? Let me-- let me come and get you. I found Tyler's body. [exhales] Above Pass Creek. Whoever shot him was still there. How do you know? Because he shot me, too. Jesus, Al. Are you okay? I'm okay. Did you see who it was? I didn't see who it was. I just saw their car... red muscle car. How would they have known I was up there? Well, how did you know? I talked to that Freya girl at Petersons'. Chief questioned her. She didn't mention anything about Pass Creek. Yeah, she doesn't really like talking to anybody. You found anything on Leland? Yeah, uh... I confirmed that Leland called Earl at the bowling alley and told him that Sophie was being raped. Jesus. Yeah. Now, it looks like Leland was staking out the trailer, because 14 minutes after he called Earl, he called us, from the same payphone within the trailer park itself. He made Earl angry enough to attack a minor, and then he tried to get him caught red-handed. Who would try to set up Earl? Earl's a nobody. I don't know, but whoever it was, they didn't want him dead. They must have had something to gain from his arrest. Someone to gain. Where are you going with this? Charlene. I found Charlene's cigarettes at Leland's. Charlene Hinters? Yeah. If Earl gets arrested for beating up a minor, then Charlene gets custody of Sophie. Okay... so maybe Charlene paid Leland to make the calls, but if she wanted Earl arrested, then who killed him? Ali? Alison, you still there? Al? Balkoff. Keep your phone close. [Debbie and Ruth argue indistinctly] He doesn't need them! He doesn't value that... You remember what I said. Sorry about her. Um... Keith robbed us, too, that day. Not that we could report it, obviously. She's still sore about it. I can relate. Prove me wrong. Can't guarantee it's going to come back. Can't guarantee we won't report it missing. Yeah, hold on, um... here. It's better to have it and not need it. Thank you. [engine starts] [light party chatter] Inside. Nobody move. Where is she? Where's Helen? [Helen]: I had a thought about the Marlowe character. [gasps] What are you doing? Why do I have a bullet hole in me? I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about. I saw the car, Helen! I saw Eli's car. I don't have it. Who does? I can't. I'm begging you. Who? [loud gunshot] Ah! It wasn't my idea. He just did it. I didn't have anything to do with it. With what? Earl. He killed Earl and made me give him Eli's car. I didn't have anything to do with it. Who? Who? Chief! Please... It was Chief. Chief killed Earl? And what do you have to do with it? Hmm? We... we... had an affair... right after he was transferred here. I... He wanted me to leave my family, but... I just couldn't do it. He won't leave me alone. And he's using Eli's car to cover his tracks. Oh, God... Somebody get me a cell phone! [phone rings] [Darryl]: You've reached Constable Tarasoff. please leave a message. [Alison]: Darryl? Meet me at Charlene's as fast as you can. [gunshot] [Sophie]: Mom? [Charlene]: Oh, fuck! Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit! [gasping in pain] Sophie? What the fuck, Ali? She shot at me, okay? Show me. Gah! What are you doing here? Does she know? About what? About Earl. God, you could have had Brandon killed, you know that? It was an accident. What is she talking about, Mom? [Charlene]: I never meant for any of this, Soph. You've got to know that. What is she talking about? [grunts] Tell her. Brandon's a fighter. All right? I knew that. He just had to take a few hits from Earl before the police got there. That's... just custody is all I wanted, okay, babe? I just wanted to take care of you. I never meant... What the fuck? No, Sophie, you've got to believe me. You had Dad killed. No, no, that's not what happened. That is exactly what happened! He's fucking dead, Mom. Nobody was supposed to die, all right? I never meant that. You've got to believe me. She didn't do it. It was Chief. What? We've got to get out of here. [Charlene]: Shit... [car approaching] Oh, God... Shit. Let's get her in the corner. [Charlene cries out] [Alison]: We're going to hide her. [Charlene yells] Take this. Look at me. Chief comes in here, you shoot him. Okay. Okay... Baby, I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. [loud footsteps approaching] [banging on door] [Darryl]: Police! Open up! Darryl! [Darryl]: Ali, you okay? We need an ambulance, though. What happened? Don't fucking move. Drop it. Drop it! The belt, Darryl, and the vest, come on. Fucking move it! Okay. Throw it over here. [Darryl]: Okay, okay. Toss it! Jesus fucking Christ! [Darryl]: What are you doing? Hey, I radioed for backup. They're on the way. Fucking move it, Darryl! Okay. [Alison]: Everyone knows. They know about the affair. They know about Earl. This was never about Earl. He was a bonus, a body to plant. After tonight, Keith is going to know exactly how it feels... child for a child. That'll be justice. He was your kid. You and Helen... Kid? Yeah, my kid, hmm? His name was Eli. [Alison cries out in pain] What the fuck are you doing? [thwack] They did this to me, Darryl. I had no choice. [Darryl grunts] [gunshot] Would Eli really want so many people dead? You shut your fucking mouth! Earl and Brandon... that's all this needed to be. I had your fucking brother right there. All he had to do was stay put... and now I got you. That's my justice. [gun clicks] [gunshot] [Ali gasps] [gunshots firing] [gunfire] [car speeding away] [gunshot] [car wheels squealing] [car stops] [distant police sirens approaching] [dogs barking] [Len]: Hey. Come on. Right over here. Who loves you? [sobs] I'm sorry, Al. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. [door slams] Hey, Daddy. [***]
