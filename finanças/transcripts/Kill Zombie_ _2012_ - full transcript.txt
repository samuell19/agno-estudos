My name is Aziz. In a few days I will be done. Game Over! Yesterday my life was still normal. I was a nobody in an office and my boss was an asshole. A slave driver. I don't like that, make it new.

Good morning, after the totally unexpected Events of the Space Station exposed part of the Dutch Population to a virus. The police received countless calls from People who witnessed the aggressive Behavior of their fellow human beings and were even attacked by them. According to experts, these people all came in contact with a previously unknown green mucus. This is located on satellite parts, which were spread over Amsterdam. Thank you, Walter. I thought the Weather fairy came in, but that doesn't sound like her. Then move on. The Prime Minister has declared a state of emergency as a precautionary measure and the army will Hermetically seal off the contaminated area. If you are still within the contaminated areas, try to leave as soon as possible! And head to a Secure area. That is my advice to you. Avoid any contact with parts of the space station and with infected persons and in case of direct confrontation is the only way to eliminate them. Yes, these pictures are not suitable for younger people. I should have told you that earlier. Please excuse this little slip-up, thank you very much. Now the movie should come. It's not coming. It is coming. As you can see, yes. No one is safe from these zombies. Because of zombies? Do you think so? this nonsense with the spaceship? Come on, they bullshit us all day. The satellite fell into an office building. Tess here. I am currently unavailable. If you leave a message, I'll be happy to call you back. - Who was that? - A girl. - Which girl? - From the office. - The office is a thing of the past, man. - Where is the other? Where is the fat one? I just need some start-up capital: For a fryer, chairs, the locality. Idiots! Eh, relax, girl. - What's your problem? - What is my problem? This is my problem. We stay here until the army arrives. Hey, no contradiction. Not a word! Shh. I don't want to hear anything. Be quiet. We stay here until the army comes. Understood? Did you understand? - Hit him with something. - Yes, but with what? Fixed, firm. Take the keyboard. Here's a stapler. That's how it will work. - There's another one. - I'll help you. - Ha, that's for you! - Catch. Finish it off. They're everywhere. I repeat. Try to reach the security zone. That is your only and last hope. You have to hit the zombies with something on the head. Yes, of course, as in the movie the other day. A silver bullet in the head helps. - What do you say, you kill vampires. - Werewolves. Werewolves hate silver. Such nonsense, what does this have to do with werewolves? No. Then don't stress me out with werewolves. I'll call you if we're coming soon meet which ones, okay? These are zombies, you shoot into the brain. Go back! Out. Everyone out. now. What happened?

Moscow has its most prestigious Explosives experts being flown in, he is supposed to take care of the enigmatic green Mucus and take care of the infected. It is not on the teleprompter, but I'll just say it anyway. All shit. As long as Jan lives, there is hope, as they say. Let's just go on now, as nothing but nothing would have happened. One moment please. These are colleagues. Now I have spilled all the coffee. Watch out. There. This way. Where do we have to go? Been here before. I know my way around, we have to go there a long way. You know your way around here? Look around, everything looks the same. I thought there was a side street here. A side street? We have gone from shit to now sitting here.

That's why I never use an elevator. Come on, get up. Go, push. Keep going. - Going up? - Yes, probably not with the elevator though. - The stairs are on the other side. - I hate climbing stairs. We have to go through the offices. Fuck .... lets do this. This is very brave of you and romantic. You're doing this for a girl, that you almost don't know at all. I put everyone in danger. Maybe it's worth it. Perhaps. - And, do you have her number? - Mo, go. Climbing stairs sucks, man. No, do not shoot, don't shoot, please. - What are you doing here? - I'm here because of the girl. - Whom? - Well Tess. You know. - What a coincidence. - I don't have time for jokes, okay? I should help her, she called me a thousand times. Tess called you? Not just me. She called everyone, that she had sex with. I'm going to try now to get out of here again. What the fuck? Why did we do all this shit? just because of some slut? Who called everyone, that she fucked? Aziz, think. It's just kidding you. We have to get out of here while we can. I'm not going any further. You have to go to the roof. Aziz, Hi! - Tess, I'm here. - Super. - But I have already been saved. - What? Yes, thank you. I have to hang up now. Goodbye. - How do we get out of here? - No problem, we take the elevator. By elevator? Isn't that dangerous? Don't worry. I am with you. Oh shit, I can't do any more. You are still alive. - Mo, where is Kim? - I lost them. - Simply lost? - Don't worry about Kim. If we were to die up here, then it's all your fault. - My fault? - Yes, your fault. - Whose fault is this? - Who ran after the slut? Which one? Fuck it. We die anyway. - Exactly, because of you. - It's my fault? - Yes of course. - Okay, it's my fault. - Yes, I say that all the time. - Now it's enough for me. You complain all your life. You break everything I build. You're a fucking loser. A nothing. A cursed nobody. Sorry, Mo. I love you. I love you too, my brother. Maybe zombie bites will do nothing to him? Yes, maybe the army has given him something so that he does not become a zombie. - You think so? - I don't know, just what I'm thinking. - He has been bitten six times. - You see, he's not going to be a zombie. - I am good. You see? - You are right. He won't. He will. Oh, fuck! Grab the detonator. - Look for Kim and blow the store in the air. - You're crazy. - Just do it. - So that you can be a hero? Do it, disappear. I had already planned everything. Both of us together. I had planned everything through. - What? - Our company of both of us. You and me. - You are crazy. - Exactly, I know that. - Mo, I'm proud of you. - I'm proud of you. You really have risked everything for this Tess. This is incredible. - Fuck Tess. - Fuck her. But Kim, promise me, that this will be something. 1,000 percent. She will make you happy make. I can feel it. Make something of it. I beg you. - But Mo, do you... - Detonator, click, boom. No, Mo. You know brother, I hate running. Go, you have to go now. I'll give you ten minutes and then I blow all the damn zombies up. Go. There is still a coke in the freezer. Goodbye, Mr. Bakels. A fucking bitch, Your friend. Genuine? At last. - Where is Mo? - On the roof. Shit. In seven minutes he blows everything up. - Come, Jeff. - Where the hell do you want to go? in five minutes Mo is gonna blow it all up. - Four minutes 50. - Come on, quickly. Come on, fucking zombies, come on. You said five minutes. Yeah, we did it. Oh, yes baby! Fuck the zombies. Hey, that's enough now. We have to go to the safe zone. We certainly never have to do it again Pay taxes. Fully horny. We did it. We are the last. Vampire? I hate vampires. Could someone please kill this zombie? The first to open his mouth, is being tasered. I hate running. Come on, their pack of undead motherfuckers. Yes, yes, yes, yes, this, this and all. - I hope the zombies eat you. - Thank you friends. And now disappears. As long as Jan lives, there is hope. It's a bit too late, I think. I think it was a bit late. Apart from a few small incidents, everything went like clockwork. But that was completely wrong now. Translated into English by Rudy S (Canada) 2022
