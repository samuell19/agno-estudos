[♪♪] HOWARD: Matt? Matt? It'’s me, Howard! Matt? Matt?JACK: It'’s been said that in the case of good and evil, we'’ve only heard one side of the story God'’s. Matt? You down here? What would the devil'’s version have to say? Chapter one: Like most people, Howard didn'’t choose his nature. He was born an innocent...What are you doing? ...and might have stayed that way if he hadn'’t met his brilliant and charismatic cousin, Matt. [♪♪] [HOWARD SCREAMING] Jack? You'’re writing? Yeah.Jack, you'’re writing. Yeah.What is it? A mystery? Ah. Even to me. Not yet. Okay. Come on. Let'’s go back to bed. Big opening night tomorrow. Well, as big as they get for us. [PIANO PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jack Hanaway. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [FEEDBACK] [CHATTERING STOPS] Thank you. Thank you very much. [PLAYING PIANO][INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Well, while you'’re out there drinking and... fondling the partners you'’ve chosen or hired for the evening, I'’ll be up here, trying to entertain you. Basically talking to the air. Let me tell you a little about myself. I was born on the other side of the tracks, in love with the songs of Gershwin and Irving Berlin, but stuck here in the late 20th century surrounded by grunge and techno-pop. MAN: Yeah. So, what do I do? Do I go with the flow? No, that would make too much sense. Instead, I hunker down and swim upstream, writing second-rate Gershwin-esque for an audience that no longer exists. So while Michael Bolton and Eddie Vedder sit at home counting their millions, I sit here, waiting for Harry Connick Jr. to have a heart attack. [CROWD CHUCKLING] I guess I'’m nothing special is what I'’m trying to say. But then again... neither are you. You play it safe. Accepting life on life'’s terms. Growing up the sons and daughters of lawyers and dentists to become the Lawyers II, Dentists, Jr., Architects: The Sequel. Comfortable, assured. Every once in a while you find yourself in a place like this. A resort. Palm Beach, Palm Springs, the Hamptons. What'’s the difference? Living the great American dream. Hey, why not? Hell, you earned it. Me? I'’ll be back season after season, tormented by the mediocrity you people have made so popular in this country. And you will go on making and spending, making and spending. And then when you'’re gone, all you'’ll leave behind... is a trust fund. Now, where does he get such unmitigated gall, you'’re asking yourselves. Well... it'’s because of my better half. My secret weapon. Botticelli beautiful, whip smart. A good singer on her way to being great. Please welcome, ladies and gentlemen, the fabulous Miss Vicki Rivas. [CROWD CLAPPING] Right now we'’d like to perform an original song for you written by yours truly. [PLAYING PIANO] ♪ At the bitter end ♪ When the smoke Has cleared ♪ ♪ And your timeless friends ♪ All have disappeared ♪ Come the bitter end ♪ When you feel betrayed ♪ I'’ll be waiting there ♪ ♪ For the final fade ♪ Because as time goes by ♪ I get more naive ♪ And I'’ve never learned ♪ ♪ When it'’s time to leave ♪ ♪ You could chalk it up ♪ To my wide-eyed youth ♪ But the sad sweet truth ♪ I comprehend ♪ That'’s why I'’m here still ♪ ♪ Right until the bitter ♪ End [PANTING] [SHUSHING] [VICKI PANTS] Mm. [EXHALES] [MOANS] [EXHALES] Nothing like opening night, huh? Mm. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] BOTH: Mm. JACK: Mm. Mm. [KNOCKS ON DOOR]JACK: Yeah. Just a sec. [SIGHS] Yeah, something that we'’re working on. JOEY: I got something for you. Miss Vicki. From Mr. Moore, one of our better-heeled customers, maybe you heard of him, renovated half this town. He'’d like the both of you to join him for a drink. Tell him he could see us tomorrow night, onstage. JOEY: That'’s not very nice. Let'’s have a drink, maybe you'’ll feel better. No, thanks, but don'’t let us stop you. Oh, you'’re so nice. Jack, we have water, OJ, tonic...[KNOCKS ON DOOR] [EXHALES] Who do you think you are?Nobody. Right. Who do you think I am? Somebody?Right again. And I do not want you insulting the audience in my club. I wasn'’t insulting them. I was bringing them to a higher level. Oh, cut the bullshit. You know the drill here. Nice hot meal plus pleasant conversation plus easy background music equals the Blue Cat. That'’s some mathematical equation. Believe me, I'’m very proud to be a factor in it too. Yeah, well, you'’re not. You'’re fired. All right. It'’s not gonna happen again. You'’re fired. I said it'’s not gonna happen again. And I said you'’re fired. JOEY: Someone liked the show, Mr. Shulman, words and all. This is from Mr. Moore. He'’s invited both of them up for a drink, and, uh, both cordially accepted. I don'’t know what counts for taste. You run out there and tell Mr. Moore-- No, wait a minute, I'’ll go... I'’ll go, you wait outside and when they get done dressing, you bring them up, all right? [GROANS] MR. MOORE: I like truth, especially when it makes me laugh. Not everyone does that'’s why they didn'’t always appreciate what you said. You'’re tough but true. I liked that.JACK: Your Shulman didn'’t. Well, he owns the place. I don'’t have that problem. Uh-uh. No, thank you. It'’s Crystal.I know. You don'’t like it?I love it. How do you know? You haven'’t tried it. I'’ve tried a lifetime'’s worth. [CHUCKLES] I love a sardonic pianist. It'’s so... Some people might say old-fashioned, but I prefer classic. Even down to the glamorous torch singer. [CHUCKLES] What, you ain'’t legal? I don'’t drink. My stepson'’s very health-conscious. He takes after his mother. So tell me, Jack, do you improvise your routine or is it scripted? I think it'’s sort of, uh, half and half. Whatever comes to me.He'’s a great writer, though. Oh? Published? Yeah, of course.Once. Jack likes to write about villains and bad guys. The publisher keeps writing to him. So, Jack, why don'’t you write anymore? My hand got tired.[VICKI CHUCKLES] VICKI: If Jack can'’t be Kafka, he'’d rather not write at all. [CHUCKLES] The fact that he'’s not Gershwin hasn'’t stopped him playing the piano.LENNY: You can say that again. Who asked you? Well, I'’ve got an early game tomorrow. Nice meeting you. Hope to see you again soon. Bye. You must come out to the house. It'’s fun. My wife prefers to stay in town, but I love to see interesting faces at the weekends. Well, we'’re uh...No, we'’ll find the time. We need some air, don'’t we, Jack? How about Saturday?Yeah, great. Great, then it'’s settled. [TYPEWRITER CLACKING] JACK: "Interesting faces at the weekends." Chapter two: Matt teaches Howard that being bad can feel pretty good. [MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKER] Pity the rich.[TYPEWRITER CLACKING] They suffer levels of boredom the rest of us can only imagine. That'’s why they love to see interesting faces at the weekend. Stop! Everybody stop. Who'’s gonna be my dance partner? Aunt Ethel had the most interesting set of faces money could buy. Ah... She was rich, bored... and very human. Howard. I'’m sorry, Aunt Ethel, I'’m... I don'’t dance. Year after year he endured the abuse. Favored by misfits, animals and old ladies. Howard hated any social gathering. Get up, you fool! [SCRATCHES][WOMAN GASPS] AUNT ETHEL: Aah! What are you doing? Let him go. Whereas Matt, well... he always managed to have himself a very good time. [GASPS] MAN: Ooh. [GASPS] Go ahead. Try it. [WHIMPERS] [WHIMPERS] No. [YELPS] [ENGINE RUNNING] [♪♪] Hey, Jack. Come on, Jackie. Jacko! It'’s me. Eddie. Co-founder of the Mosholu Parkway Sinner'’s League. Eddie Bianco. I wouldn'’t have recognized you in a million years. Why? It'’s the same old me, only more, uh, to love. How are you? You look great.[LAUGHING] God. You look the same. You must have sold your soul to the devil. This is your car? Yeah, it'’s an antique. You'’re an antique. It'’s a fossil. Come on in. Nice place.Yeah. Abe Lincoln, eh? Well, they rent it for the gigs. It'’s not like--It'’s a nice place. It'’s a lot of light. It'’s free. It hasn'’t been a walk in the park for me. And I compromised. Uh-huh. What are you doing now? Selling insurance or what? No, no, you better watch your step. Eddie Bianco, private investigator. Got a badge and everything? Ah, you know, regular old shit. Uh, nothing special. Divorces, illegal sublets. Strictly meat and potatoes. So everything Philip Marlowe wouldn'’t do, you do. Beats grabbing fare jumpers and pointing tourists to Windows on the World.VICKI: Do you believe it? I got all the way to the post office and realized-- JACK: Hey, honey, look. Can you believe who showed up? What are you doing here?Look at you. It'’s a miracle. I was out here on business. When I saw the sign at the Blue Cat, I couldn'’t believe it.That'’s just rehearsal for our big debut at Carnegie Hall in October. Coffee? Oh, no, no. I mean, none for me. I-- What I'’d really like is a drink. We serve coffee here, Eddie, and that'’s all, I'’m afraid. Well, why don'’t you and I, we'’ll go out and get a drink? Perfect.Perfect. Because, uh... you had that thing anyways, right? What thing? That thing that you, uh... I thought you had that thing?No. You-- You don'’t trust me, right?No, I don'’t. Honey, I'’m not 7, okay? Okay? If you'’re going shopping, you take some money-- Yeah, I'’ll go shopping.Take some money. No. Honey? Honey? VICKI: See you later, Eddie. Uh, see you. Women. Creatures of paradox. If you begged her to come, she'’d have preferred shopping.I know. You still writing, huh, Jack? Yeah, well, you know what they say, Jack-of-all-trades, master of none. I always said you could do anything you put your mind to. Let me throw some stuff on and we'’ll go. Good morning, madam, how are you today? Regular, black. We roast our own beans. Congratulations. You look like you need freshening here. Maybe I can interest you in a little lemon poppy muffin... MR. MOORE: May I? Oh, hi. Please. WAITER: We roast our beans...WOMAN: All right. MR. MOORE: Uh, a pot of espresso and a pitcher of steamed milk. So I'’d say what a nice surprise, but... there are very few surprises in this town. It'’s hard to walk down Main Street this time of year without bumping into absolutely everyone. But a nice surprise anyway. Thank you. Did you cheat on her? [SCOFFS] Please, look at me. What took her so long would be a better question. It was never like you and Vick. I mean, we weren'’t exactly soul mates to begin with. Yeah, but Eddie, you gotta lighten up. Taking everything so seriously. You'’re gonna kill yourself. Things can change.That'’s what I'’m saying. Look, I came out here on a job. I'’m tailing a guy.Yeah? Same old shit. Suspicious woman, late 50s, looks every minute of it. But she'’s loaded and married. And don'’t tell me, jealous, right? This is life, Jack. It doesn'’t have to be original. He takes good care of her, handles her money, and he lives like a king. I'’m starting to like him already. I wouldn'’t be so sure.What do you mean? His name is Fred Moore. We love Manhattan, but Jack kind of burned a few bridges up there. He had a little... I guess you could call it love affair with alcohol for a while. We got through it, though. Took some time, but he'’s okay now. The reputation'’s harder to recover. So you helped him through his love affair with alcohol, moved out here with him... I can'’t believe a woman like you hasn'’t had her offers. Either you love him deeply or you'’re very stupid. Do you think I'’m stupid? I'’m sorry, I-- You said it. Do you think I'’m stupid? No, I don'’t think you'’re stupid. He'’s not cheating on her or nothing. Not even a hooker. The guy hasn'’t jerked off in the two months I'’ve been tailing him. I was losing all hope till last night. I saw you and Vicki and Moore. I notice... he can'’t keep his eyes off her. He can'’t keep his eyes off Vicki. If he cheats on his wife, it'’s worth a lot to him to make sure she doesn'’t find out. Eddie, what the fuck? I mean, what happened to you, man? Look, I know-- I know it'’s not easy. This doesn'’t come natural to me either, but... I was up all night thinking about it. He'’s a creep. He married this woman for her money and used it to his advantage. I don'’t think you know how much money we'’re talking about here. You see this place? He owns it. The restaurant, the view, that showroom piano gathering dust in the corner in there. Remember poverty, Jack? Well, it haunts me like a motherfucker. The clock'’s ticking, Jack. Let'’s face it, neither of us is living up to our potential here. I saw your gig. Verdict'’s in, buddy. You crapped out. I'’m offering you a second chance. Come on, Jack, tell me you wouldn'’t like to be in his position. Tell me you wouldn'’t like to have what this cocksucker takes for granted. Come on, man, why not? Tell me one good reason. Vicki. [SIGHS] Listen, just ask her, see what she says. If I thought this would come between the two of you, I'’d never dream of it. But you got the real thing. All you need is a little dough to complete the picture. It'’s a lot of dough. She doesn'’t have to fuck him, just make out. Enough for me to get three good shots. That'’s all. I'’m not a crook.You weren'’t a pianist either until you started playing-- You know, I'’ve got an ex-wife and three kids to feed. [BAND PLAYING] MR. SHULMAN: I don'’t want you looking at them. I catch you slinging any more of that about owning this place, that'’s it. Get out. Don'’t let me see your face until it'’s time to take out the garbage, you mook. Hey, Hanaway, how you doing? Hey. Listen, I know you heard, but thanks for pretending you didn'’t. All right. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Right here, sir. Can I get you anything? Hey, come over here. [PLAYING PIANO] [BANGING] WOMAN: What'’s wrong? There, that'’s better. You know, folks, here on earth there'’s two kinds of people: the haves and the have-nots. I was born into the second category and never really managed to work my way out of it. The best way to become a have is to marry one. And I came very close, believe me. Her name was Frieda. She was 50-something, not very good-looking, but very, very rich. I was myself, as usual. JACK: I was playing for my supper at a party on... You guessed it... Park Avenue. The haves are nothing if not predictable. Frieda liked what she saw and what she heard. Anyways, like in the old movies... cut to her place, drunk, later. She says, "Let me slip into something comfortable." Reappears on the steps a few minutes later in a pink negligee. She says, "Do you like it?" [INHALES] I'’m a gentleman. I say, "Yes." She kisses me on the mouth. Shows me a huge diamond ring. Says, "Do you like it?" I don'’t answer. She leads me to the bathroom. She tosses the ring into the toilet. Says, "You want it? It'’s all yours." I look at her, then at the ring and I flush. [CROWD LAUGHING] Needless to say, she was not too happy. [CROWD LAUGHING] Cut to my place two weeks later. She calls me. She says she admires what I did, wants to see me again. Can she come over? At 10:00... the doorbell rings. It'’s... Vera. My friend. Vera, who, uh, got into a fight with her boy friend, he kicked her out. She needed a place to stay. I said, "Well, I'’ve got a woman coming over." She steps into my walk-in closet, says, "I'’ll sleep here. I won'’t bother you." Frieda arrives right on time. Enters the apartment like she'’s a queen entering the stable. Says to me, "Play your cards right, "everything I have can be yours. "What I have is three houses in New York, one in L.A., one in Paris and a pied-à-terre in Venice." [LAUGHS] Pied-à-terre. Me? I come from a pied-à-terre in the Bronx. [CROWD LAUGHING] So I say, "Well, that'’s what you have, huh? Let me show you what I have. I have a girl in my closet." [CROWD CHUCKLES] Never heard from Frieda again. [CROWD LAUGHING] That was 10 years ago. I said this story happened to me, but I lied. Because I'’m not the same guy I was 10 years ago. Because I had that opportunity today, by some miracle, if I had that chance, I'’d reach into that toilet [PLAYING PIANO]and I'’d grab that ring. Vera or no Vera. And I'’d be a have. And I'’d have a Mercedes and stocks and bonds. But it'’s too late for that now. [♪♪] [♪♪] JACK: Chapter three: the real thing.[TYPEWRITER CLACKING] Years went by and Howard forgot about his cousin, Matt. Howard did his homework, followed all the rules and was duly rewarded with the fine position of filing clerk at a law firm. Surely life has more to offer than brown bag lunches and the Dewey decimal system, right? Ah, Vera. Hello. She loved him for himself. In her eyes, you were already a big success, right, pal? We'’re sweethearts now. JACK: Alone together life was a fairy tale. But the outside world cast a long shadow. If only you could stay in the light, sunning yourself in Vera'’s smile. Hmm. Mm... Mm. Hi.Hi. I was, um, doing some thinking. I know, always a dangerous thing, but I'’ve been thinking that we deserve more, you know? What do you mean? I mean, like, you know, a house, a nice car, you know, things that normal people have. We'’ve never been just normal people. I know.[CHUCKLES] But here'’s the thing... we can. It doesn'’t bother you? Of course it bothers me. It'’s just... You know, uh, I think... it bothers me more that I have to watch you live the way we live year after year, and... Besides, it'’s not real. And how far do you want me to let it go? Well, you know, take him someplace, make out with him a little bit, maybe, uh... let him feel you up a little bit. Feel me up? Top, bottom, second base, third, home run? No, really, tell me. That'’s okay. If you don'’t wanna do it, it'’s okay. Do you want me to do it? [EXHALES] I think it'’s a good idea. I mean-- Well, then, we'’re on our way to normal. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] [♪♪] [BANGING ON DOOR] Eddie. Hey. [BANGING CONTINUES] Yeah, I wanted to apologize to you about that too. [LOCK CLICKS] Well, that'’s why I'’m calling. I talked to her. Hello, cousin. We'’re in. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hi. Hi. Thank you.Oui,madame. Mr. Moore is waiting for you on the veranda. [MUTTERING] Hey, nice car. [CHUCKLES] I told him I'’d take care of it. Don'’t worry about it.Hello. Hi. Hi. Gosh, you look different in the daylight. You can see the crows feet now. Ah. [CHUCKLES] Tell her she looks even more stunning. This place is stunning. I have no words. Great. Oh, excuse me. Um, Vicki, Jack, this is my friend, Jim Zamsky.Nice to meet you. How are you? Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you too. Jim and I have some projects here. [LAUGHS] A few. Why don'’t you show Vicki the grounds? Sure. All right. Come on. Follow me. I wouldn'’t mind seeing the, uh... I wanna talk to you. What can I fix you to drink? How about a seltzer? That'’d be great. Sure. Lemon, lime? Um... lemon. I really liked your monologue the other night. Oh, thanks. So do you think I qualify to be a have? Depends on what you have. A lot. I can'’t think of anything that I ever wanted that I don'’t have. Really? Well, I guess you must be pretty lucky. It'’s not luck. Well, I didn'’t, uh... I didn'’t mean anything by that. [CHUCKLES] Don'’t worry about it. Besides, I'’m sure even you have shoved your hand in the lavatory once or twice, Jack. Hey, Fred, didn'’t we get that 18th-century chandelier from those, uh, projects you built last year in Atlanta, right? Yeah, sure. Actually, we found it in a chateau in Aix-en-Provence. Ever been? The bas-relief were hand-carved by an American artist especially for this house. VICKY: Your wife has excellent taste. She does. We found it in Europe. Actually, it'’s a really funny story. VICKI: Is that a closet? MR. MOORE: Can'’t have enough space to put things. VICKI: Jack, come. It'’s bigger than the apartment we have in New York.You mean the pied-à-terre. [LAUGHS] Yeah, the pied-à-terre. JIM: The wiring in this house was a nightmare when we first found it. Everything had to be gutted. [PLAYING PIANO] MR. MOORE: Just been tuned. I have a birthday on Friday, so I'’m giving a party. You dog, you. Really? MR. MOORE: To which, of course, you'’re all invited. VICKI: Thank you. {PLAYING PIANO] Whoo! JACK: Chapter four: it'’s not luck. You know, Howard, I hope that promotion comes through, then maybe we can throw a little meat in the sauce. Howard was just another nice guy, destined to finish last. MATT: What the hell is going on? HOWARD: Calm down. I'’ve got candles. It'’s an old building. JACK: "At his salary, Howard should feel happy to get anything," said the landlord. "This slumlord should feel lucky to get a nice chump like Howard," said Matt. ...sell the building. You'’re such a good boy, Howard. [♪♪] JACK: The landlord would understand. Howard believed that a reasonable argument and a smile could work wonders. [MAN GASPS] [GRUNTS] Matt did not. MATT: Come on, get in here. Let'’s get him inside. [LAUGHING] JIM: Bravo! That was great. When did you learn to do that?Very nice. Wow. That was wonderful. [PIANO PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] WOMAN 1: Oh. Wasn'’t it? WOMAN 2: That was beautiful. It'’s time to play. "I'’m Craving," okay? WOMAN 3: Good job.

Jack'’s in the city with an old friend. [CHUCKLES] I know I'’m probably crazy, but... It'’s so quiet here, and I'’m not used to it. I keep hearing noises outside. Yeah, it sounds like there might be someone out there. I'’m sure it'’s nothing, but--[GLASS BREAKS] There. Did you hear that? They'’re already locked. Okay, hurry. What'’s wrong with you, huh?It'’s not my fault. Bottle was wet.It'’s supposed to be. You'’re stepping in that. Move back. You'’re dragging it all over the kitchen. Shoes off.You don'’t want me to take my shoes off.Shoes off. [CLINKING] Fred, I'’m so glad you'’re here. I'’m just gonna check--No, no, no, it'’s okay. After we hung up a patrol car came by. I guess I panicked. They found some footprints in the sand, but whoever it was took off. You okay?Yeah, I'’m okay. Sure?Yeah, sure. He'’s in. He'’s in, all right. Just stay down. Calm down and stay down. Let me handle this now. I know what I'’m doing.Oh, excuse me, Mannix. [♪♪] What are they doing? Nothing. They didn'’t get there yet. You have to smoke, right? What are you doing?I'’m welding. Well, I'’ll put this to bed and then I'’d better be getting home. No, don'’t leave so soon. Let'’s talk. We'’ve barely had a chance to get to know each other. MR. MOORE: That'’s true. JACK: There he is. Getting it? He'’s not doing anything.Just get it. EDDIE: They'’re not making any contact. You'’re gonna miss it. Stop talking, start shooting. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] JACK: Shoot the whole thing.[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Where'’s he going? [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Where'’s she going?These aren'’t good. These are-- I never felt I'’d be happy out of New York. But I'’m really getting to like it. [♪♪] I can'’t do this. [CHUCKLES] You must love your wife a lot or you'’re very stupid. I just keep my end of the bargain. I met Judith when I first arrived in the States. All I had was one suit and a dressing gown. Now I have my businesses, my properties, and my wife. If I screw up one, I screw up them all. You'’re a lovely woman. If I can help you in any way, I want to. But, please... don'’t embarrass me or yourself. Don'’t worry. What? What? He'’s gone. Hey, maybe they went to the bedroom. Hey, that'’s a good thing. [DOOR CLICKS] Huh? What happened? He turned me down. God. What are the odds? [PHONE RINGING] Are you deaf or what? [RINGING CONTINUES] Hello? Oh, hi. [MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [VICKI SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Mm-hm. Mm-hm. [VICKY SPEAKING IN SPANISH] JACK: So, what did dear mama have to say for herself? The same thing she'’s been saying for the last 10 years. If I wanna come home, she'’ll send a ticket. Just tell her send the money instead. Hm. Very funny. JACK: Chapter five: The real thing gets realer. VERA: I should go.Vera? JACK: Vera said you seemed different. VERA: Please let me go. JACK: Change was inevitable. Listen.You'’re hurting me. But still, hard to take.Vera. Even when invited in. [♪♪] I don'’t really have much time. I told Jack I was going shopping. Couldn'’t you have told him you were seeing a friend? It'’s not that easy to lie to Jack. It'’s not a lie. [BIRDS CHIRPING] When I left your house the other night, I realized you were right. We haven'’t really had a chance to get to know each other. Which is probably just as well. I'’ve given it a lot of thought, thoughts I can'’t afford. [BIRDS CHIRPING] What I'’m trying to say is, I think we should get it out of our systems. Well, that'’s ironic. Where are you going?VICKI: Back home. MR. MOORE: I'’ll drive you. VICKI: I have my own car, remember? I'’ll see you at the party. MR. MOORE: I have to see you before then. We'’re still friends, right? Friends can have lunch. Can'’t we have lunch? Tomorrow? Okay. [CAMERA CLICKING] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Right this way, Mrs. Moore. Come on in, please. Please make yourself comfortable. Here, sit. Sit down there.Thank you. Oh, what a lovely scent.[EXHALES] Sorry, I apologize, as the cleaning lady'’s a little late. Can I get you anything? No, thank you. Any news? You married a very smart man, Mrs. Moore. He covers his tracks very well. [CHUCKLES] There'’s been some indication, nothing that I can prove yet, but some indication that--Some indication. Unfortunately, yes. Your husband might be seeing somebody. Late-night outings, a mysterious disappearance for two hours a week ago. Mr. Bianco, I'’m about to fire you. Excuse me? I pay you good money to investigate my husband'’s affairs and I have to find out the truth from my son, the last person I want to involve here. What are you talking about? When? Yesterday. He was at the beach house. Where were you? I told you about it. And I find out he was there all afternoon with a woman. Do you have any idea who she might be? She'’s no one. What'’s--? I don'’t know. I don'’t know, my son said some... Spanish singer, Vicki Perez. But you know, Mr. Bianco, I cannot have my son skulking around like some amateur detective, and particularly not when I'’m paying you to do that. I am gonna give you a chance to redeem yourself, earn a reward. Believe me, you won'’t be sorry. But I have to see that proof for myself. This could be a little fling I don'’t know, something. It'’s quite possibly something that I can just... MR. MOORE: I was gonna wait until the renovations were finished but the Broken Ivory'’s booking entertainment now. Do you know the club? No. It'’s nice. It'’s a bit more up-market than the Blue Cat. And, um, I just happen to know the owner, me. [CHUCKLES] I'’d love to book you there for all of next season. It'’s not, you know, charity or anything. It'’s something that'’s been on my mind since I first heard you sing. [BELL CLANGING] I'’ll run it by Jack, we'’ll see. Why do you stay with him? You'’ve no marriage. You have no obligations. I'’m sure you'’d have no trouble finding someone else. People who care about each other stay with each other. You might become fat or bald or sick or maybe just not so amusing anymore. Somebody loves you, they'’re there with you, no matter what. I'’d love to be with you. Fred, it'’s much better if we don'’t see each other again. [♪♪] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [HORN BLARES] [SIGHS] Uh, maybe it'’s better you you go home now. I'’ll, um... I'’ll walk you out. [♪♪] EDDIE: Jack? Jack? Hey, Jacko. JACK: Hey. What do you think, huh? Friday night. It'’s perfect. I mean, look at this tree This tree is so front and center, like a house seat. Give him the rope, he'’ll hang himself. He doesn'’t think anybody could put anything over on him, especially schmucks like you and me, but I got the perfect plan. Friday, around 11:00, at the party. Vicki, looking great like we know she can she pulls Moore aside, says, "Gotta talk to you upstairs. I been thinking about you all week." Right? Now, she takes him up to the bedroom. You'’re there in the tree, right? She takes him up to the bedroom they'’re kissing, whatever. They get up there, she works him over to the bed, she gets him on the bed, starts kissing him, bang, on the bed. Start shooting your pictures, we wallpaper his coffin. EDDIE: Listen.It'’s the perfect plan. We couldn'’t have designed it better if we built the house. Jack, you were right.It'’s great. But it'’s a stupid plan. You'’re second-guessing yourself.I'’m idiot. You always do this. Listen.Forget it. We'’ll go back to New York, we'’ll give it another shot. Will you please take a look? Look at this. Look how simple this is, huh? Jack, I'’m not gonna do it. Why? I can'’t. I-- I'’ll never be able to get on the grounds. Look, I hide you in the trunk, right? I drop you off by the tree. Nobody'’s gonna notice that. You climb up in the tree. You can hide a choir in that-- I'’m out of it. I'’m done. You should get out of it too. Grab your things, get Vicki, go back to New York, and forget you ever saw Moore. This is out of our league, Jack. Hey, I'’m sorry I... I'’m sorry I ever dragged you into it. So you, uh, made a deal, right? What are you talking about?You made a deal, right? What'’d you take, 5 grand? Jack. Huh? Twenty-five hundred? What? Have another drink.Blame it on the booze. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me you didn'’t make a deal. Come on. Yeah, I thought so. You'’re a fucking loser, Eddie. You'’re the first guy to open your mouth, get everybody excited. First sign of trouble, you'’re the first to run. Your balls shrink up like little peanuts. Back off! Jack. You didn'’t have the balls for all the shit we did. You didn'’t have the balls to be a cop, for your wife. Shut up!Isn'’t that the problem? Your dick wouldn'’t get hard? Enough.Ah. I'’ll fucking kill you. All right? I'’ll kill you. Now shut that up. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.[GUN CLICKS] Squeeze the trigger, Eddie. Go ahead. Huh? Come on, come on, do it, do it. Huh? Come on. You don'’t have the fucking balls for that either. Go ahead, run away like a little baby now. Go ahead. But you'’re still fucked. You know why? I'’m gonna take the photos and go after the big money. When he gives me the big money, he'’s gonna blame you because he already gave you the small money. You fat fuck! I still love you, though. JACK: Chapter six: [♪♪] It'’s out of our league, Howard. You wanna believe in people...So? ...against all odds.How did it go? HOWARD: I didn'’t get it. You deserve a promotion. But that'’s what makes life such a goddamned crapshoot, pal. I got fired. Watch it now. Here it comes. Harold? The bullshit. I'’m glad I ran into you, Harold. Uh, it'’s Howard. It'’s Howard. "So sorry, couldn'’t work it out," Blah, blah, blah. In the meantime, keep your chin up, hmm? Happy now? MATT: That'’s her, isn'’t it? No wonder you didn'’t get the job. Thank God for Matt, huh? We'’ll take care of him. What do you mean Eddie'’s out?[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] JACK: He chickened out. Fuck him. We don'’t need him. What are we gonna do? Same thing.[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Business as usual. You can'’t do it. Everyone will be watching you! Honey, nobody'’s interested in me, okay? Except maybe you. [SCOFFS][CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hi. Why are you calling me? [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]No, I can'’t. Okay, I'’ll try. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Some salesman. Come on. [♪♪] [CLEARS THROAT][CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [SLURPS] [BAND PLAYING] Hey, Jack, how you doing?Hey. I thought you were on the wagon. One drink'’s not gonna kill me.You okay? Yeah. Still waiting for my partner. Twenty minutes before showtime, she'’s still out gallivanting. You gonna give us one of your sermons? I don'’t think so. It'’s a pity. I'’m gonna miss them. I got a sense of humor.Yeah, well, your boss doesn'’t. He might ask you to lean on me. I'’d hate to do that. Yeah, but you'’d do it, right? Jack, a job is a job. I wouldn'’t enjoy it while I was doing it. Oh, that'’s a lovely sentiment. Come on, huh? Loosen up. Fine.Pulling your chain. I hung up the brass knuckles a long time ago. Yeah, after an illustrious career. Right? Hey, I had my moments. Before you say anything, what do you think? On sale, 50 percent off.

Gorgeous and guilty. Lee Remick, Days of Wine and Roses. But you have to come in for a closer inspection. JACK: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Tonight I'’d like to propose a toast, to Eve who hung out with Adam and alone destroyed that utterly boring place called paradise. I'’m sure even God must have admired her courage and her beguiling disobedience. Because after all that'’s how human history unfolded. So... to Eve. Thanks for the apple. MR. ANDERSON: Good night, Vera. Good night, Mr. Anderson. JACK: A little story. Once upon a time, there was a very nice little girl named Little Red Riding Hood. Took a shortcut through the woods, went to her grandma'’s house, both sat down and had a very nice little lunch. The end. Boring, right? Because the wolf, didn'’t show up. [♪♪] Without the wolf we have no story. Oh, by the way, our fabulous host, Mr. Shulman. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING][CLAPPING] [PLAYS PIANO] Don'’t get worried about this because I can guarantee it'’s gonna be my last. Because I quit. So I guess what I'’m trying to say is... that we shouldn'’t be afraid of the bad guy. I'’m not saying the bad guy is always the most interesting person, but every story has to have one. [GRUNTING] We all need a villain. If we can'’t find the villain outside, we need to find the villain inside. Wake him up, embrace him...[GRUNTING] ...and travel with him down that darker path. As for me, my decision is made. My bags are packed. [GRUNTING]I'’m ready to roll. I'’m going to be, for once... [SCREAMING] ...the wolf. [PLAYING PIANO] What were you doing? What took you so long? Picking out this tie. I think, uh... I think it'’s all right. You think that dress is, uh... too much...? That'’s the point, isn'’t it? You got the camera? Mm. I got the camera. [♪♪] JACK: Great, the window'’s open. Perfect.VICKI: Yeah. Are you okay?Yeah, I'’m fine. [GRUNTS] Just remember... [GRUNTS] ...you know, make out with him, make your move, so I can get that final shot. Yep. [BAND PLAYING][INDISTINCT CHATTERING] There he is.Where? There. [SIGHS] Vicki, how nice to see you. Happy birthday. The party'’s a hit. MR. MOORE: Ah. A couple of celebrities and a few paparazzi never fails with this gang. Happy birthday.Thank you, Jack. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Fred, darling, a moment. Ah, excuse me, um... I'’ll catch you later. Nice suit, Jack. Must be the lady, huh? Pretty well-preserved. Why don'’t you, uh, go mingle, keep an eye on him? Hmm. [♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [EXHALES] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [♪♪] [EXHALES THEN HISSES] JOEY: Hey, Hanaway! Hey. Horn player sounds like Gunga Din, huh? Well, I think Gunga Din would show up on time, though. What are you doing? Working? You got a house full of people like them on the inside, you need people like me on the outside. We take care of them, they take advantage-- I mean, they take care of us. Right. You'’re turning into a real philosopher, aren'’t you? JOEY: Yeah, just a notch above stupid. Yeah. Listen, why don'’t you go inside? At least for tonight, you'’re one of them. Yeah, okay. All right. Thank you. Hey, Hanaway! Why don'’t you play a number later on? Even from out here, I like to hear you play. All right. [♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] You look so... JIM: Hey, Fred! Ha-ha! Vicki, I wanna say you look beautiful tonight. Fred, happy birthday, you old man, you. Go take care of your guests. Yes. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Hi. Where were you? You'’re still hungry? What am I supposed to do? He disappeared. Any problems? No. You should eat something too. All that booze on an empty stomach. What do you mean?Come on, Jack. What? I can'’t do anything with that window like that, the curtains closed. Why not?What am I gonna say to--? What am I supposed to say to Mrs. Moore? "This blur is your husband, this is the girl"? Then why don'’t you just go upstairs and open the goddamn window yourself? Don'’t get drunk, okay? You gotta keep your wits. It'’s not for my wits. It'’s for my courage. Smart-ass. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Excuse me. I'’ll see you later. Sure, sure. MR. MOORE: Perhaps I will. Excuse me, Fred. I need to talk to you alone. Hold that thought. Not here. MRS. MOORE: That there... [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] That was redone, repainted by an American artist.Yeah? [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] JACK: Really? This whole thing?MRS. MOORE: Yes. That one over there, of course... [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] I'’m gonna run to the men'’s room. [MRS. MOORE CHUCKLES] [THUNDER CRASHES] Don'’t close the door. Why? I don'’t wanna get you in trouble. I don'’t mind. What? Getting into trouble. [♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] MAN: Hey, Jack, how'’s it--? Hey, Jack. Awful party, huh? Yeah. Your, uh, stepfather seems to be having a good time.[CHUCKLES] Yeah. Hey, you gonna play a little piano for us tonight, maybe? Uh, no. Tonight'’s really sort of strictly a pleasure thing with me. I'’m leaving. I'’m leaving for New York on Monday. Oh. What are you up to anyways? Nothing. I'’m just gonna get some air. You okay? Fine. Sure? Yeah. Okay. You know, you, uh... You might wanna try focusing your attention on something more worthwhile, maybe, I don'’t know... Maybe a woman? So you'’re back to the big city. It'’s a great gig. Great money. You deserve it. Before I lose you to the glittering lights... I'’d really like to tell you what you'’ve meant to me. Feelings I'’ve had... [♪♪] My dear cousin. Come in. [THUNDER RUMBLING] We'’ve done so many things together. I feel like you and I... like we'’re one, huh? [MR. MOORE CHUCKLES] Sometimes I even feel as if I'’m lovable when I'’m with you. Makes all this so meaningless. [GRUNTING] MATT: It made me so proud, Howard. You'’ve come so far. But your mind is still weak.[GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] MATT: It may not seem like it now, but it'’s for your own good. You'’re gonna thank me for this, Howard. You'’re gonna thank me forever. You know, whether you stay or go, I can'’t go back to my wife. I'’d ask you to come away with me, but... But? [THUNDER CRASHES] [♪♪] MR. MOORE: Well, there'’s nothing left for me to say. It'’s up to you now. You know that, don'’t you? MATT: It'’s time, Howard. [WHIMPERING] MATT: Be strong. [♪♪] Wait. [♪♪] You see? There'’s your lovely, virtuous girlfriend! A whore like all the rest! Why would she be any different, huh? VERA: Don'’t listen to him.MATT: Because you loved her? She showed me what your love was worth. VERA: Don'’t!MATT: That'’s right, Howard. She begged me for it. She begged like a mangy mutt begs for scraps. VERA: No, it'’s not true! It'’s true! Don'’t lie!No, it'’s not! VERA: Howard, please. MATT: You have no choice.VERA: Don'’t do it. Please.
