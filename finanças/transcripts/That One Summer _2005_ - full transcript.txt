(light orchestral music) (light orchestral music) (phone rings) - Hello? What? Dad? You gotta be kidding. Of course I can. Thanks for calling. (light orchestral music) Hey, Mike! - Hey. - Glad you could make it. - I didn't know grandpa was here. - Neither did I. - So what happened? - Well he was up on a ladder and something gave way. - On a ladder? At his age? - Have you been in? - Not yet, I figured I'd wait for you. - Excuse me, how's he doing? - Are you family? - Yeah, I'm his son and Mike here's his grandson. - He took quite a fall. - Is he gonna be all right? - He broke arm and a leg, has some sore ribs too. He seems pretty tough. - That's how I remember him. - Well I'm sure he'll be very happy to see you. I'll be back in a minute. - Thanks. - You know, I've never even met the guy. - Come on. (gentle piano music) (knocking on door) - Yes? - Mr. Garner? - Yes. - I'm your son, Ted. - Oh? And who's this with you? - This is my son Mike. - Hi, grandpa. - Hi. How old are you? - I'm 25, sir. - 25? 25. - So where you been? - Around. You know. - Boy, you got banged up. - Yeah, well you know how it is. Cheap ladder. So how's New York? - We've been in Northern Michigan for the past 20 years. - Oh? So what have you been doing with yourself? Are you still taking pictures? - So it takes something like this to happen for us to get in touch? - Well I've been thinking a lot about you lately and when I fell off that ladder I, oh never mind, how have you been? - Dad, I never thought I'd see you again. - Well I traveled a lot and- - Oh come on, you didn't even make it to mom's funeral. - I feel bad about that. I feel bad because your mom was a fine woman. - You should've gone. (coughing) - [Mike] Grandpa, you want some water? (coughs) - Please. - So what have you been doing with yourself? - Oh I was here and there in Florida, Texas, Alabama for awhile. I got a condo here now you know. - Why didn't you ever call us? I mean weren't you ever interested in your family? - Ted, when I left your mother I was, well there wasn't any- - Excuse me, this will just take a second. How are you holding up? - Oh, this is my son and my grandson. They both came in from up North. - Actually I live here in Ann Arbor. - Here? - Well it's good to have visitors. Well it's up a little. Excited about your company? - I guess. - Can we talk? - Sure. - Would you pull this down for me, son? - Absolutely. - With his broken arm and leg and all he's gonna have to change some things at home. - Like what? - He's gonna need some help. It's gonna take awhile for him to recover from this. - It looks like he's doing all right here. - He'll be discharged in a week or so, after that he is gonna need some care at home. Are there other family members around? - Well there's Mike and I and my wife and daughter. - You have an extra room? - Oh no, I don't think that would be a very good idea. - I was just saying. - Can't he just stay here? - No, we really need the room for patients with more urgent issues. (sighing) Well give it some thought. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You know, it's good to see you. How's your wife? - Beth? - [Otis] That her name? - We're all right. Lindsey's in Michigan State and wants to be a nurse. - Who's Lindsey? - Lindsey's my daughter. - Oh. I sure wish I could have some years back. - We all have regrets. - Me most of all. You're my only son and I hardly know you. And I'm ashamed because of it. - Well you did take care of us. Mom always seemed to have enough money. - At least you didn't make the same mistake with your kids. - Tried not to. I had tough times too, I just didn't run off. - I wish I could've been there to help you. - Yeah, I know how it can be. Kids and all, work and everything. I know how it can be. But I remember one summer in particular when Mike was a kid. Boy, I won't forget that. - What happened? - It kinda started out one evening. I went up to the attic to look for something and I came across some films I'd made. Man that was fun. (upbeat swing music) - Dad? Dad. - What are you doing up here? - Mom sent me. - What did you do this time? - Nothing, she just thought I should come up here and talk to you. Who's that? - [Ted's] Your Uncle Bob. You know Bob. - [Mike] Uncle Bob? It doesn't look like him. - That was probably 20 years ago. Long before he had that beard. - What's he doing? - Just messing around. It's a film I made when I was a kid, it's called "Summer Sports on Ice." - I didn't know you made movies, I thought you just took pictures. - Well wait a minute here. You didn't know I made movies? I made plenty of them, that's what I went to college out West for. - Why'd you stop? - Well I guess it's a little thing called adulthood. I tried to make a go of it, but there just wasn't money in it. - What do you mean, movies make millions. (laughs) - You don't make much money if you're not very good. But we were getting better. I guess time just ran out. - Why? - Well it was okay when it was just me and your mom starving, but I couldn't risk her going to prison for armed robbery or something. When you came along we had to do something. Besides, her family hated the whole idea. They thought I was nuts. - Dad, did Mike tell you what he did to me? - [Mike] Lindsey, don't be rude, dad's explaining something. Go ahead, dad. - Come on over here, Lind. Maybe we should talk. - Mike made me walk in dog poop and get my new shoes dirty. - Mike! - I did not dad, I was trying to take a picture and she just walked in it. - You made me! - [Mike] How'd I make you? - You know! - No I don't. - Okay, okay, I've heard enough. Now Lind, we've been over this about the dog and being careful where you walk. - But he- - And Mike, you knew exactly what you were doing, apologize. - But- - Now! - I'm sorry Lindsey, I won't ever tell you where to walk again in your entire miserable life. - Fine! - And you'll clean her shoes too. - [Mike] Dad! - What's all this stuff? - This is film equipment I used years ago. - You know, if I had something really cool to do like making movies, I wouldn't have to bug Lindsey so much. - [Ted] Well I'll tell you what, let me get my Super 8. - Cool, I can't wait to show Andy. - He'll break it, dad. - Shut up, Lindsey. - Mike, now two things. First, I'll go over the basics with you, but I don't want you to do anything until you read the entire manual. - No problem. - Okay, and second, you don't leave the house until your sister's shoes are clean. - [Mike] Okay. - Good. Let's a take a good look at this baby. This top loading idea was really cool, It gave the camera a Hollywood kind of feel. - Cool. - Now the first thing is you gotta know if you're shooting indoors or outdoors. Outdoor light is cool and bluish. Now, wait, I gotta see it in order to explain this. Did you get Lindsey's shoes cleaned? - Yeah, they're clean! I'm heading over to my best friend Andy's house. I showed him the camera and he got pretty excited about it too. - Oh wow, so we can make our own movie? - Yeah, he taught me all about it last night. I even have an idea for the movie. - What's it about? - It's called "Blood in the Sand." I'll tell you about it on the way to the beach, but right now go inside and get an old shirt on. - What for? - Because acting's dirty work. - Okay, when do I use the ketchup? - In a minute, you start over there. (light orchestral music) Okay, when I say action you pretend to walk, okay? - Okay. - Ready? Action! Great, that's a take, now get over here and change your wardrobe. Now get over there and act mean. - Okay. - Back up a little. Okay, and don't look at the camera. All right, action! Cut, that was great! - I felt that role was more me. - Okay, now this time get over there and act scary and yell no no, don't shoot. - But there's no sound. - Do it anyway so it looks real. - Okay. - [Mike] Ready? Action. - No no, don't shoot! Don't shoot! - [Mike] Cut, that was perfect! - Hey, this is a lot of work. Hey when are we gonna show this? - I figure we can make a couple movies and then have a premiere in our garage. - That would be great! - Okay now this time laugh real evil, then start blasting away and jerk around a whole lot like the gun's real powerful. Okay? - Okay. - [Mike] Action! (maniacal laughter) (gun firing) - Cut, that was great! Now for the ketchup. Okay, you get over there and act real scared, and then all of a sudden grab your chest and let the ketchup squirt out all over the place. All the time you're shaking around like crazy 'cause bullets are blasting your guts all over the place. - And then I fall down and jerk around some more before I die right? - Right. - [Andy] This enough ketchup? - Yeah I think so. Get into position. All right, action! (grunting) That's great, keep dying! This is great! All right, come on, this looks cool! All right, all right you're dead. Okay. Come on, you're ruining the shot. All right, all right you're dead. Cut, that's a wrap! - How was I? Did I die good? - Yeah, you were great. Except I think we might have a problem. (light orchestral music) - Could you excuse me for a second? - Sure. - Hey, it looks like you guys have been having some major fun, but I was wondering when you'd show up here. - How'd you know we'd come? - Well sooner or later I knew you'd need some of this. - Thanks dad. - You didn't read that page of the manual, huh? - My mom's gonna kill me. - Actually, this was kinda good luck. We forgot to shoot the title "Blood in the Sand", so now we can go back and shoot it again without wasting any film. All you need is a new shirt, Andy. - What are you two doing here? - Actually we've come to do some filming. - Oh yeah? Who you filming? - You guys of course. Get somebody like you on film before you turn pro and one day it'll be worth a bundle. - Yeah, I guess that's real smart. So what should we do? - Just be yourselves. We'll take a bunch of shots and then have a premiere in our garage. - Cool, am I gonna be in it? - Yeah, and a bunch of you guys. Maybe even some cheerleaders. - What are we waiting for? Come on, let's play. - All right, let's bat! Come on guys, get in the outfield! - [Kid] I'm first base! (upbeat rockabilly music) - [Mike] Yup, they were themselves all right. It was a real cinema-graphic smorgasbord. And Me and Andy got it all on film! ♪ I know just what to do ♪ ♪ I got that want to smooth step ♪ ♪ I got that want to groove ♪ ♪ I got that want to smooth step ♪ ♪ With a rock-a-billy mama with a smooth step ♪ ♪ Rock-a-billy mama with a smooth step ♪ ♪ Rock-a-billy mama with a smooth step ♪ ♪ Come on, rock-a-billy baby with your cool daddy ♪ ♪ Rock-a-billy baby with your cool dad ♪ ♪ My landlord's hip to my overtime ♪ ♪ Daddy Mac's on the lamb ♪ ♪ I got the blackened eye and I'm ready to slide ♪ ♪ I know just what to do man ♪ Dad's old camera picked up every little detail. ♪ I got that want to smooth step ♪ ♪ I got that want to groove ♪ ♪ I got that want to smooth step ♪ ♪ With a rock-a-billy mama with a smooth step ♪ ♪ Rock-a-billy mama with a smooth step ♪ ♪ Rock-a-billy mama with a smooth step ♪ ♪ Rock-a-billy baby with your cool daddy ♪ ♪ Rock-a-billy baby with your cool dad ♪ I think they were happy we came. They can't wait to see themselves on film. And we can't wait to show them. - I'm sorry Mike, but it's not gonna work out. - But without the big camera we can't do fade ins or fade outs or dissolves. - I understand Mike, but I gotta show you how to use it and I just don't have the time right now. Look, I'm overloaded here and I'm trying to help your mom with her remodeling job. - But you promised! - Excuse me. I've got a problem with these pictures you developed here. - What's the matter, Jonathan? - Look at this one, it looks awful. I want my money back. - You see that streak? - Yeah. - Well that shows that you didn't have your camera set properly to use the flash. - I don't care, it doesn't look good and you have a satisfaction guaranteed policy. I want my money back. - Excuse me, Jonathan. Mike, I promise I'll help you, but we're hitting our busy season now. Maybe in a month. - But our premiere's next week. (clears throat) - Just keep using that small camera. We'll talk about it later. (upbeat orchestral music) - [Mike] We really wanted to use dad's big camera, but since we couldn't we just had to be more creative with the little one. Dad said we'd find some of the best opportunities in our own backyard. Or bathroom. Or kitchen. (upbeat orchestral music) In fact, once I got to the kitchen I just stayed there for a few days. As usual, dad was right. - Ow! - [Mike] But grandma, the camera's fun and- - Look, I don't mind you playing with the camera, but you shouldn't get any foolish ideas like your father had. Real work can't be fun and games. - Yes, grandma. But you will come to our premiere won't you? - I suppose so if it's not all foolishness. - No no, it'll be cool. - Well if you say so. - Great, thanks grandma, we'll see you. - All right, be good! - [Andy] Bye, Mrs. Emerson! - [Mike] Bye, grandma! (upbeat orchestral music) Grandpa never talks much, but it's always easy to find out which room he's in. Although he seems to have a soup eating disorder, he managed to inspire us to do a cooking show. - And then for the other meaty flavor, we now add the worms! Voila! - Just a second, ma'am. Mike, I promise I'll help, but not right away okay? - You said you'd teach us how to use the big camera as soon as we learned all about this one. - Look, I'm really in a hurry, I'm missing the best sun of the day. - He needs to take a parenting class. - Later, please? - You know you small town businesses just don't understand the customer. This is a service industry and the customer comes first. Where I come from they can appreciate that. (upbeat orchestral music) - [Mike] Since we couldn't get the big camera, and we had achieved our creative limits with the small one, it was time to ship off the film and get it processed. Hey grandma! - [Andy] Hey Mrs. Emerson! - [Mike] Everyone was excited to see what we'd get back, even grandma. I think. (upbeat orchestral music) When it came back, we weren't quite sure what we had, but there were little pictures on all the film, so we at least knew it that the batteries we stole from Lindsey's tape player were good. Now we had to get serious about our premiere. We did some print advertising. And we cleaned out the garage for what must have been the first time in 50 years. It looked like a dust bowl! We had a lot to do to get ready for the premiere. (upbeat orchestral music) - And your change is $1.05. - Thanks. - Take care. - I gotta get going and finish setting up. You will be there, won't you? - I'll try, Mike. Jenny's supposed to come back after supper and cover for me, but she wasn't feeling very well this afternoon. - Dad, this is important! - Mike, I'll do what I can to make it, you know that. Your mom will be there for sure. - Excuse me, could you help me over here? - I'll be right over. Hey, you have a good time and I'll see you later. - Okay. - Good luck! - Think we should start? - I think so, it's already a couple minutes past seven. You guys ready? - Yeah. - I hope they don't make fools out of themselves. - Hello everyone. Hello everyone! - [All] Hello! - Thank you for all coming. Tonight you will see the world premiere of four short movies Andy Schwabach and I made. We hope you like them. Got anything to say Andy? - No. - Okay, well then let's get started. Andy, the screen? (audience applauding) - [Boy] That's really cool. - Yeah, cool. - Not bad. - [Mike] Just have to get back here to get things started. Here we go! Our first feature presentation is entitled "Blood in the Sand." Ha ha ha, I'm gonna get you, you piece of rat food! - [Andy] No no. - [Mike] The sound's a little off, but I think you got the point. Free the llamas I say! Free them and let them eat cake! Ha ha ha ha ha! - [Andy] No no, please, I beg you. - [Mike] I love it when you beg, but I'm still gonna blast your guts out until they have to use a shovel to clean you up! - Hey, where am I in this thing? - [Andy] Oh, I'm hit! How could you shoot an unarmed llama farmer? - [Mike] Easy, you just can! - This is stupid! - It most certainly is. - Would you two please be quiet? - [Mike] Our next feature film is entitled "What Morons Do in Their Spare Time." I got it, I got it, I got it! I don't got it. Ouch! I bet that hurt! - [Boy] Hey this isn't funny. - [Mike] Oh a wise guy, huh? - [Boy] These jerks are gonna get it. - [Mike] I wonder what's over to the girl's left? A nose miner huh? Whoa! - I don't believe this! I never do that. - [Mike] She's up to her first knuckle already. Mmmm! (vomiting melody) - Michael is history! - [Mike] Our next feature film is called "What Adults Do When No One's Looking." (kids laughing) Yowza yowza, look what I sees! Looks like she's a little behind on her gardening. Shake that thing, grandma! Yeehaw! ♪ Feelings ♪ ♪ Nothing more than feelings ♪ ♪ Trying to forget my feelings of love ♪ - [Mike] Oh boy, a refrigerator! Glad I dressed for the occasion. Let's see. Hmmm. This stuff looks so good it makes my butt itch! (laughing) (snorting) I wonder if there's any clean underwear in here. (goofy laughter) Our fourth and final feature film is "Gross Soup" starring Chef Undie. - Welcome to Chef Undie's Kitchen! Today we will prepare the feast of gross soup. Today we will fix the soup and the salad. But first for the salad, a little of this and a little of that. And then we add the Roman leaves from the sewer drain where the most bugs and animal droppings can gather. - This one's kinda funny. - [Girl] No it's not, it's sick! - More of this and more of that. (garage door creaking) And then for the other meaty flavor, we now add the worms. - Andy, get the door! - [Lindsey] What's happened? - [Boy] Take it easy! (all murmuring) - Just sit down for a second. I'm sorry. - [Andy] And that was the salad. Next, instead of the salad, we'll put more bugs. It's so crunchy. - [Woman] Michael. (laughing) (upbeat orchestral music) - I'm sorry everybody! I didn't know what was going on. - That was horrible! Don't you ever do anything to me like that again, you little monster! - Mother. - Whoa whoa, slow down buddy, hey! Hey, I'm sorry! I didn't know what was going on. - You, you and your cameras again! He's a fool just like you were. You oughta be ashamed of yourself! Henry, come on, we're going home. - I blew it big time. - You should go up and talk to him. - He's embarrassed. - [Ted] Lind, you take it easy on Mike. He's feeling really bad. - He should. - I'll go up and see if he'll talk to me. (gentle orchestral music) (knocking on door) - Can I come in? - Yeah. - [Ted] How you doing? - Great. - Can I sit down? Hey, I'm really sorry about last night, I really messed things up for you. - No you didn't. They hated the films. You didn't have anything to do with it. - Well I sure didn't help. I did get a chance to look at the films afterwards and I liked them a lot. Except for maybe those wide angle shots of my butt at the fridge, when'd you take those? Seriously Mike, you had some really good stuff in there, really good stuff. It's a heck of a lot better than anything I did when I was your age. Look Michael, critics are everywhere, but there are very very few creators. What you did was create something and that's special. I don't care if it was good or bad. I don't know how to say this, but I sure don't want you to quit. Especially because somebody's criticizing you. Critics are petty. What you did was great and that's gotta mean something, doesn't it? - Yeah, but you quit making movies too. - That was my mistake. I listened to the critics. I was stupid, really stupid, and I don't want you to do the same thing. - But I need some help. - And I'm gonna give it to you. - When? - Mike, we've been over this. As soon as I can, when I get the chance. We're just swamped right now. - You're always swamped during the summer. Then when you get time off I'm back in school. - It'll be different this time. Please, come on, trust me. Look, I've gotta go. We'll talk about this later. See you later? (uplifting orchestral music) Good morning, Evelyn. - There's nothing good about this morning. Not after last night's performance. You should give that boy a good talking to. - We've talked. - Well I hope so. Save him from becoming the same kind of foolish dreamer you were. - Evelyn, give it a rest. - I beg your pardon? - I said give it a rest, why don't you. Why do you have to pick on that kid? Mike's only 12, give him a break. - That boy needs straightening out. - No, you're the one that needs straightening out. What that boy did was fantastic. It was fun, and I'm proud of him! - Well what that boy did- - Let me make myself clear. Leave him alone. - Well I am his grandmother- - Leave him alone! - I only have his best- - Leave him alone! (light orchestral music) Excuse me, can I help you? - Yeah, are you Ted Garner? - That's right. - Well the photo studio down the street said that you might be able to help us. We need someone to take pictures at a- - A family get-together. - Yeah, that's it, a get-together. - And Boswick's turned you down or were they too high? - Too high. - Turned us down. - Turned us down. - Too high. - Well they would've been too high, but they turned us down anyway seeing as it's such short notice. - When is this family get-together? - Tonight starting about five. - Boy, that is short notice, I- - Oh please please! - It's with our grandpa and there's no way he'll be here the next time we're in town. - But I- - It'll only take a couple hours. - But I have to be here in the store at least until six. - That's perfect, sometime after six will be great, everyone will still be at the- - The family get-together. - Yeah. - Well I have some things at home I have to do too. - Oh please? - What kind of budget are you working with? - 250. - 300. - [Shelly] Yeah, what she said, 300. - That sounds pretty generous. And you pay for supplies and processing too? - [Amy] Sure, no problem. - [Shelly] So you'll do it? - Yeah, I think so. - Great, here's the address. It's 109 Sixth. - You know where that is? - Well I don't know where the house is, but I know where Sixth Street is- - That's right, so you'll have no trouble finding it. Come on, Shelly, he's a busy man. - Bye. - See you around six. - [Amy] Okay! - What planet did they drop off of? - I don't know, California probably. - California's not a planet. - Yes it is, trust me. So looks like you'll be late again tonight. - Yeah, looks that way. Maybe we should go over there. Jenny, can you take the front? - Got it. - You know, you really do owe yourself and us a little time off. I don't just mean working around the house, I mean doing fun things with the kids. Like we used to enjoy, remember? Anyway, you promised me a vacation. And I don't know when I'm gonna have two weeks off work again. - Beth, you know I'm working on it. If Jenny can handle things around here the way I think she can, maybe I can sneak off a couple of days this summer. - You have five other employees who would like more hours. - [Tim] Sure, and then our margins fall. - So maybe that's okay once in awhile. - Beth. So what have you three been up to lately? - Michael's been apologizing to everybody for last night. - Well not everybody, just some of the more severely offended. Like Andy's parents. Oh, and the girl with the finger up her nose. Oh, and we talked to my mother this morning and she was surprisingly forgiving. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that would you? - No no, why should I know anything about your mother? - I don't know, but we saw her coming up the walkway as you were leaving and let's just say she handled it better than I expected. (chuckling) - So Mike, why are you talking up such a storm? How you doing? - Okay. - [Mike] Hey I was thinking maybe I'd break out that big camera this weekend. What do you think? - Fine. - Fine? Is that all? I thought you'd be really excited. - It's great dad, it really is, except looks like this place is getting busy. - Yeah, you're right. We'll talk about it later, okay? - [Mike] Sure. - And be careful at that family get-together. Those two women are very strange. - You're not jealous now are you? - No, I just think you should watch out for those two weirdos. - They were fine. I'm sure it'll be a fun time with a nice family. This can't be right. - Hello, Ted. - Hi Walt, how you doing? - Good and yourself? - Oh I'm fine except I think I must've been given the wrong address. I was supposed to take some pictures at a family get-together and this is where they sent me. - Well actually Ted, I think you're in the right place. You're looking for two blonde women? - Yeah. - Well you're where you're supposed to be. ♪ And shake it all about ♪ ♪ You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around ♪ ♪ That's what it's all about ♪ - You do the hokey pokey, that's when you- - It doesn't matter if you do it like this or do it like this. - Ted Garner, welcome! - Can I get you some punch, Ted? - Sure, I mean no, I don't understand, what is this? - Well Ted, we didn't exactly go into all the details because we weren't sure you'd show, but this is the family get-together. - Yeah. - And your grandpa? - Oh we were telling the truth all right, Ted. As you can see, he won't be here the next time we're in town. - Bud Eagleston? - [Shelly] You knew grandpa? - Yeah, he sold me my life insurance. - Kinda ironic. (light piano music) - Ester! You know better. ("Amazing Grace") (jazzy piano music) - What's that? - It's a camera. (upbeat swing music) - And the winner of the Rest in Peace floral arrangement is- - [Both] Kimberly! (all cheering) - That was great, but I don't think everyone was visible. Let's have some of us sit and put grandpa on grandma's knee. - Hey you know, I think Amy's right. Hey Walt, nobody would mind if we move grandpa around would they? - [Man] Not grandpa. (all laughing) - Walt, what do you think? - I'm sorry, but this has been highly irregular to start with, let alone playing hide the urn. (all groaning) - Hey Walt, come on, be a sport. - Well I guess it's not illegal. (all cheering) - [Man] Grandpa, all right! - I hate to spoil the fun for everybody, but I'm out of film. (all groaning) - Didn't you bring enough? - Oh I brought more than enough, but I've been firing away like crazy and now I'm out, sorry. - Anyone got some extra film? - No, no no no no, I use special film, professional stuff, and nobody here would have any. Anyway, I'm wrapping it up for the night. (all groaning) - Real bummer. - Major bummer. - Yeah, yeah, it's a real bummer. I'll tell you, it's a real bummer! I used more film tonight than I use at most weddings. I never used this much film at a funeral before. I'm sure you two will be happy. - Well should I write you a check now? - I'll tell you what, I'll be in touch. I gotta get out of here. - [Shelly] If you're sure. - Positive! (tires screeching) (dog barking) So I took my first summer vacation since the year after Mike was born. (upbeat rock music) You know, it's been so long since I've taken a real vacation I'm not sure I can even relax anymore. I'll probably be hyper the whole time. It'll be a lot of good time with the family. Things we should've been doing 10 years ago. (upbeat rock music) Look Mike, over there. Over there. - [Mike] Where? - [Ted] Right there. - [Mike] Oh I got it. - [Ted] It's a buck. Are you level? - [Mike] Yup. - [Ted] Focused? - [Mike] Uh huh. - [Ted] All right. - [Mike] Wow. (upbeat rock music) (laughing) Hey dad, who's this guy we're going to see? - Well his name is Chris. We were in the service together and well I haven't seen him in awhile, but he's a character and he loves to tell stories. I thought maybe he could give us some help with some film ideas. - [Mike] Cool. What happened? - Darn car. It's acting up, Mike. - Terrific. - I should've taken it to the shop last week. Nothing. - Well what are we gonna do now? - I don't know, it looks like we're stuck out here. - There's some kind of light through the tree, maybe we could ask for help. - [Lindsey] It looks spooky. - Wanna walk home, Lind? - [Lindsey] No. - Well then- - Well we'd better get out. Now be careful. - Oof! - Put your coats on! - [Mike] Jeez, don't push me! - Michael, calm down. - [Mike] I didn't do it! Yeah, yeah. - [Beth] Both of you have coats on and everybody stay close to the car please? - [Mike] Yeah yeah yeah. - [Beth] Lind, you okay? Okay, come on, let's go. - [Lindsey] Over here. - [Beth] I got it. - [Mike] I got the flashlight! - [Beth] Ow, Mike! - [Ted] Mike, get that light out of our eyes! - [Lindsey] Daddy, I'm scared. - [Ted] You come with me, Lind. - [Andy] Oooo, Lindsey's scared. - [Mike] Boogeyman's gonna get you, Lind! - [Lindsey] Dad, mom, make them stop! - [Beth] Okay you two, knock it off, this could be serious. - [Mike] Aw mom, we're only a few miles from town and there's gotta be somebody up by that light that can help. - [Beth] I know, but I think we still need to be careful. - [Mike] Mom, come on, nothing's gonna happen. Come on, let's go. - [Beth] Well watch out. There's some scary things out there. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Mike] Coming dad? - [Ted] Go ahead, my shoe's untied! We'll be right behind you! (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Mike] Come on, let's go head into the woods and scare 'em. - [Andy] Yeah! (frog croaking) This is awesome! - Shhh! (owl hooting) - What was that? - Shh, just a bird or something. - [Andy] It didn't sound like any bird. - Be quiet, would you? (suspenseful orchestral music) - I don't like this. Mike, where's your dad? - Dad? You there? Come on, let's go. (suspenseful orchestral music) (screaming) (growling) Run for it! - [Andy] Which way? - Over there, no this way! Mom, dad, mom! - [Andy] Where are we? - I don't know. (both screaming) - We gotta go back to the car! - Mom, dad! (growling) (screaming) (suspenseful orchestral music) (screaming) - You guys aren't scared, are you? - What's going on? - Didn't I introduce you to Chris? - Hey boys, I hope I didn't boil your blood. This is a good friend of mine, Kenny Pheasant. - How we doing boys, are we having fun yet? (laughing) - Did we forget to tell you that's why we pulled over, because this is where Chris lives? (laughs) I can't believe we forgot to do that. - That's not funny, not even a little! - Well I'm gonna let Kenny tell the story, but basically it's a native legend about the Manitou Islands and the Sleeping Bear Dunes. - [Beth] Is this something the boys might wanna record? - I sure thing so. It'd be a great opportunity Mike, if Kenny doesn't mind. - [Kenny] No, I don't mind at all. - Great, well then come on Andy, let's shoot this. - Man, if I'd known you were gonna be recording this, I would've told the story. (laughing) - Hey Lind, come on over. - [Ted] Tripod. - Out of the way. Come here you. - How about just over a little bit. Right there. - We just have to put this on you so we can take sounds. - Okay. - Well don't you think you should hide the microphone a little bit better? - Yeah, thanks. Andy, could you get that? - Okay. - All right, got it. - [Mike] I guess we're ready. - Let's rock and roll. - Okay, get the sound. - [Andy] Recording. - Anytime. - I am a descendant of the Adawa tribe of the Algonquin nation. (percussive music) This is a story that has been told from generation to generation by our elders by word of mouth. This story of Chimqua and her cubs. (dramatic orchestral music) And all those who know the story of Chimqua and her cubs know that life is blessed because of her faithfulness and her love. - Boys, I think he's done, you can cut the sound film. - [Mike] Yeah. - Kenny, that was just terrific. - [Mike] I think it was more than that, I think that was our story. - It'll be great, you can fill in the spots with all the shots of the birds and the other wildlife you guys took. - But there's still a few things missing. - Yeah, the dunes will be easy, but we'll still have to get some stuff from the water like the Manitou Islands and the bears, they'll be hard to make up. - Well that's what good friends are for. Eddie, you in there? Eddie! Come on out! - Does he live in there or something? - Yeah, it's his home, his vessel, and his way of making a living all rolled into one. - [Ted] Eddie! - You'll have to do better than that to get ol' Eddie up. Hey Eddie! - Ah, yeah yeah yeah! (laughing) Yeah yeah, that's 50 bucks a half day per person, 70 bucks for a full day! - [Ted] It's me, Ted. - How you doing? Of course I remember! I was just cleaning up a few things here for you. (chuckling) How ya doing you two, you look- - Eddie? I'd like you to meet my son Mike. - How you doing, buddy? (laughs) Nice, hey, what you got in here? - A camera, be careful. - I'm a careful kind of guy. - And his friend Andy. - Hey, how you doing, nice to meet ya. - You know, I'm not so sure about this. I don't much like the water, I mean the deep kind you know? - Hey kid, grab that styrofoam cup over there and we'll stuff her in the bilge. (laughs) - Eddie, you sure this isn't too early for you? - No, no Ted, I've been up for hours. Doing paperwork and all, trying to stay ahead of the game and all. I just gotta clean up a few things and we'll be ready to, you know- - I'll tell you what, I'll stay and help and maybe the boys can run to the store for a few things. - Oh sure, sure, we got plenty of time for whatever, you know. But if we're gonna be out for awhile, I'm gonna need some more oil. Where are we going? - To the Manitous, remember? - Yup, we're gonna need some more oil all right! (laughing) - Mike, here's a 20. You and Andy run to the store and get some pop and chips and couple things to munch on. - Okay! - Hey Mike, I'll go with you. (jazzy swing music) - Eddie! You get back here! Don't you think you're going nowhere, you promised me! - Change of plans boys, we're ready now! - But we need food, Eddie! - Trust me Ted, Maggie's not having one of her better days. - Come on boys, hurry up! Get in, Mike, come on! Andy, come on. Come on, Christopher! - [Eddie] She'll work you over. - She looks safer than your boat. - [Mike] Come on, Chris. - Come on. - Whoa, hey! - Eddie! Don't you move! - Ted, cast off this line! - I'm gonna get you Eddie! - Get rid of the line, Ted! (boat revs) - Don't you leave me! (grunting) Oh Eddie! (grunting) I'm gonna get you, Eddie! - Lovely day to be on the water, huh boys? Just lovely. (laughing) - You're gonna come back and I'm gonna get you! - Jeez, looks like we're going through a little fog bank here, boys. (laughing) Here kid, take over. I gotta add a little bit of oil. You could blow the horn if you wanna. (boat honks) - Cool boat, Eddie. - Sure is. - Thanks, boys. - Think we'll see any freighters, Eddie? - Well if this fog bank lifts I guess we will. (laughing) - How big are the freighters, Eddie? - Hundreds of feet, some of them even thousands. - Really? - Yup. Let's see, a football field's 300 feet long, so that means you could have three games going on at one time and still plenty of room left over for them cheerleaders! (laughs) Love them cheerleaders. Course Maggie don't. (laughing) - Whoa! - Hey Chris, remember, you can't swim. I guess that's why they call these the inland seas, eh Eddie? I mean this is no small body of water. - Yup, good ol' Lake Michigan. 80 miles wide and 400 miles long. - Any shipwrecks in the area? - That's a great subject, Ted. - Yeah, about 150. Dangerous waters around them islands. We used to lose a few every year. Why a single storm back in 1879 took 30 big ships and pushed 100 more at ground. - But none in recent years, right Eddie? - Nah, but we still lose a few. - [Ted] Mike, you're steering, get back to the helm! - Hey, I thought you were supposed to get another case of oil before we left! - Ah no problem, Christopher. I use this stuff all the time. It's just that it's more expensive than the heavier grade. - Eddie, are you sure? This is a long trip. - Aw don't worry Ted, don't worry. I'll get you out to the islands, over to the dunes, anywhere you wanna get. - But the oil, Eddie, the oil! - No problem, absolutely positively no problem. - [Chris] "Not a problem," he says! "Trust me," he says! Ha! - [Eddie] Believe me, this is not a problem! - [Ted] Not a problem, first you forgot we were coming, then Maggie almost kills us with a frying pan, now the Coast Guard has to tow us home because you forgot the oil and look what these seagulls did to our clothes! If these aren't problems, what is? - [Eddie] Nah nah nah, there ain't no problems. It's when you walk through your front door and your wife sees you, now that's a problem! (laughing) (snoring) - Shh. Was it a fun day, you ask? Well it was a glorious day, it was a beautiful day, and the camera's safe and the film is all safe too and the boys were never in jeopardy for an instant, isn't that right, son? - Right dad. - And you're probably concerned about the Coast Guard people and whether or not they were kind, well hey, they couldn't have been nicer. What a bonus, eh son? - A major bonus, dad. - There we were out on Lake Michigan. We had an all expense paid tour of an authentic shipwreck and who should come by but the Coast Guard and offer us a ride. Hey, do we know how to live or what, eh son? - A definite or what. (snoring) - This is great. Two days ago I get a call from the Coast Guard that Eddie Vermillion's boat is on fire and my son and husband have just been taken off the shipwreck. Now, in an apparent effort to top that near fiasco we're taking a trip up North to film live bears. - Bear cubs, honey. - Bear cubs and their full grown mother. - It's a tame mother. This is Joe Hudson, he's twice as stable as Eddie. - Implying what? That you took our son to the middle of Lake Michigan with someone who's less than stable? - It wasn't the middle of Lake Michigan, it was only 16 miles out. And I never said that Eddie was unstable, I just said that Joe was more stable. Or twice as stable. Stabler, whatever. - Uh huh. - Come on kids, let's go! - Didn't come off too well. - Hey, that's a surprise. - [Mike] Let's go! On the road again! - All right, we're outta here. (jazzy music) Ready? (car revs) - [Ted] Gee, I wonder why I don't take vacations more often. Ah, Beth will forget about Eddie soon enough. Besides, we shot some beautiful stuff for the boys' movie. Now if we just don't get ourselves killed working with Joe's bears, this will be quite a trip. We think we live pretty far up North, but Joe, he's way up there. Close to the Canadian border. (dogs barking) Hey! - Hey Ted, how you doing? - Real good man. Good to see you, Joe. - I didn't know if you were gonna make it or not. - I'll tell you, either this drive is getting longer or I'm getting older. - Mileage is the same. (laughing) - [Ted] Hey you guys, come on over here and meet Joe! - How many dogs do you have? - Oh it varies from day to day, 25 or so. - Come on you guys, come over here. Joe, I'd like you to meet our two. This is Mike. - Grab onto that hand, Mike, and you shake. (laughing) And this is Lindsey. - Hi, Lindsey. - And this is Michael's bet friend Andy Schwabach. - Hi, Andy. - Hey, Mr. Hudson. - So I hear you guys wanna film some bear. - Yeah, my dad says you own four of them. - We sure do. - [Beth] Oh my. - In fact here comes Nancy with two of 'em now. - [Mike] Oh look at 'em! - [Beth] You see those, Lind? - Come on now, slow down. - [Mike] Oh wow, look at 'em. Neato. Can we pet them? - Yeah. - [All] Hi! - Hi, Beth. - Hi, Nancy, how are you? Looks like you've got your hands full. - Well they're just babies, but they're a lot of fun. - Nancy, you think we could film the mother too? - Well Ted, I don't think so because the mother's a little hard to handle and the male's much easier. - Anyway, you're the expert, we're just happy to be here. - [Ted] Yeah, thanks for taking time off of work. - That's all right, I work for a great boss. I'm self employed. (laughing) Okay, it looks like this is gonna take awhile, so we better get going. - Come on, fella. (dogs barking) - Cut! That was great except we still didn't have much smoke. - Does that mean we'll have to do it again? - I guess we have to. - Yeah, I think so too. - [Mike] So are you guys gonna give me some more smoke? - I'm working on it as hard as I can! - Hey Lind, here's something to fan the fire with. - That's what I told her to do! (light orchestral music) Cut. That was great! It looked like there had to be a fire in the woods! (light orchestral music) - [Ted] I gotta give the boys credit. They really went to work and made the most of the opportunity. They shot some beautiful footage today despite a few distractions like fish carcasses and an ornery little sister who slimed their lens. But all in all, I'd call it a major success. - Come on. Come on. (bear growling) (light orchestral music) (cubs growling) - [Mike] The bears were unbelievable. They were the best actors I ever worked with. (light orchestral music) Man did they love to swim. We couldn't get them out of the water! I think they were having as much fun as we were. - Nancy, thank you so much, this has been a real treat for us. - Well you're certainly welcome, Beth, I enjoyed it too. - It's just so beautiful here. I can really understand why you guys stay. - Well we work to survive, but this is what we live for. The bears, the water, the woods. - You really got your act together, Joe. (light orchestral music) Dad, you still awake? - No Mike, I'm sleeping too. - I'm supposed to keep you company, but I can't keep my eyes open. - I'm fine, you rest. - You going back to work tomorrow? - Unfortunately, yeah. - We still have a lot of work to do on our movie, don't we? - You do, but everything's there. Now you just have to put it together. - You still gonna help us? - No doubt about it, son. No doubt about it. (light orchestral music) - [Mike] The fun didn't end with the vacation. Dad was happier than I'd seen him in a long time. Even at work. Plus he kept helping us with the Sleeping Bear film. (light orchestral music) - Come on, you guys. You know your mom thought I sold all this stuff. It's pretty valuable, but I figured I'd need it someday. - What are these things? - What you have there is a viewer Andy, be very careful. These are the rewind spools back here. Whoa. Now you put the film on these, run it through the viewer, and you can see what's on the film. Let's get down to the basement and put them on the workbench. - Cool, does all this stuff go? - Yup, it all goes. I'll get this if you can take those. - Okay, be careful with the viewer, Andy. - Okay Andy, now just turn that handle. - [Mike] Wow, is this ever cool! - [Ted] Everybody was right. A vacation sure didn't kill our business. Plus it was like getting a shot in the arm. I started enjoying things again, especially any time I could get with the kids. They poured so much effort into that film. I just hope people appreciate how hard they're working. (dramatic orchestral music) - Isn't that Chuck from The Gazette over there? - Yeah it is. - Well the boys wanted a bigger audience for their film. Do you think maybe The Gazette would do a small story on what they've been up to? I mean it's pretty neat for a pair of 12 year olds. - [Ted] Thanks Bob for taking time out for us, I know you've had a long day. - I'm happy to do it. So how will this do for your little film? - This is perfect! Can we do it, dad? - Well it raises expectations, but I like it too. I'd go for it. Where do you think we should put the screen though? - Over there. - What about there? - Hey Jack, how about over here? - [Jack] Let me come in back here, see if I can have them turn and look at me. Yeah, that looks good. Okay guys, turn around and look at me a little bit. That's good, that's good, hold still. Great! (jazzy music) - Kenny's pause just isn't long enough for this shot. - But we need this shot. It's too good to waste and it won't fit anywhere else. - You know, Andy's right, Mike. That's the beauty of editing. Let's just create a pause. You can control time with this equipment. Now that's some power. - But how? - Let me show you. (upbeat rock music) Hey, nice job guys! This is gonna be a great place for your show. - I just hope we have a good enough show to give 'em. - Yeah. - Trust me, you do. But there's something I wanna tell you. I wanna say it in the right way. These past two weeks have really been something. We've had a chance to meet some very unusual people. - I'll say. - No kidding. - Unusual, but also special. Very special. People who might not have a great deal of material wealth, but they're rich in the way they live their lives and that's what I want you to get. The chance to do for your lives what you love to do. I don't care if it's running a business or making films or chasing bears around. Just do what you were put on this Earth to do and do it the best you can. If it's right, the rest will follow. (light orchestral music) (all chattering) - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Very warm out. - Oh I'm sorry. Hi, good to see you, how are you? - I didn't expect this many. - My stomach doesn't feel so good. - You look like you need an antacid. - [Beth] Lindsey, keep passing popcorn. - I wish dad would get here. - [Woman] How's it going? - It's okay. He'll be here, I promise. He wouldn't miss this for the world. Hi. - Thank you, Ted. - Take care. - I've got a problem. - I don't think you do. - Oh yes I do. Six pictures on this last roll didn't turn out. - Only six, huh Jonathan? Well as incompetent are you are, that's pretty impressive. - What did you say? - I'll tell you what, you can keep the pictures, and here, take a five, no, take a 10! - Ted, Ted. - Have a 20, you can keep 'em both! - Would you like me to take over? - Yeah, I gotta run. - These clowns pull anything funny again, they're gonna get it big time. - Yeah, and I got more of the same. - Excuse me, boys. Got room for me here? - Yeah I guess. - Good. You know Mike and Andy are about the two best friends I've got in the whole world. We're gonna cheer real hard for 'em. Right fellas? - Uh yeah, sure. - Absolutely. - Good. - You got room for us there, Christopher? - Hey Eddie, come on in. Move down boys, more of Mike and Andy's buds are here. - You met Maggie before, ain't you Christopher? - Kinda. - He looks different without a life vest. (laughing) - I certainly hope this will be an improvement over what happened the last time. - Mother, let me make myself perfectly clear. You will enjoy this. - I can only hope that I will. - No, you don't understand. You will enjoy this and note my inflection, that was not a question. - Well yes, of course. Certainly I will. - [Beth] Thank you. - It's time to start the movie, Mike, it's time. - Dad. Hello everyone. Hello everyone. (loud whistling) Thanks, Maggie. We'd like to get started. My name's Mike Garner and this is Andy Schwabach. Andy's gonna tell you a little bit about the movie we made. - The title of our film is "Sleeping Bear", it tells about the old Native American legend that tells how the Sleeping Bear Dunes and Manitou Islands came to be. - Okay, that was short, so does anybody need any popcorn? I guess that means no. Okay, let's get started. You got the lights, Andy? - [Andy] Got it! - [Mike] Okay, here we go. (gentle orchestral music) (Mike grunting) (all laughing) - [Boy] Way to go, Mikey! - Before you plug it in, make sure you have the projector and recorder turned on. Okay, plug it in and you're ready to go. - Sorry about that, folks. Let's try it again. (light orchestral music) - I am a descendant of the Adawa tribe of the Algonquin nation. This story has been passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth by our elders. When I first heard the story of Chimqua and her cubs, it was told by my grandfather, the mishomis. Mishomis in our language means my grandfather, and as we would gather by the (speaking foreign language) the fire much like this, it would rekindle all the old legends and the old stories from the way back as grandfather would speak. Long long ago, in a time before the coming of the white man, in his ships and sails, there was a land of great woods with the tallest of pine trees. This land was near a giant and powerful lake. (bird screeching) The land and water had no names then. Now we know them as Wisconsin and Lake Michigan. In the woods, and along the waters lived many birds, animals, insects and fish. Among them was a bear the Adawa people called Chimqua. (bear growls) One spring, Chimqua gave birth to two cubs. The cubs played, found food, and grew strong in the woods. When they were thirsty they went to drink from the great lake. But this was a summer like Chimqua had never seen before. The sun seemed closer to the Earth and no clouds were in the sky. Each day was hot, hotter than the one before. Soon the forest became dry. Then one night, powerful winds came. Then thunder. (speaking foreign language) Lightning from the sky, and the lightning struck the dry forest. (thunder booms) (speaking foreign language) Immediately a terrible fire began. By morning, Chimqua had gathered her cubs and took them to the great lake as the fires chased them. Once in the water, they felt safe. The land was on fire and the wise mother knew her forest was no more. Fires would remain for many days and there would be no food for her cubs, but she knew of a land across the great waters. A land much like this with forest and food for all the animals. Chimqua did not know how far away the land was, but she knew they must go. Together they swam, for two days and nights. The cubs grew weary, but still they saw no land. Chimqua urged her cubs to follow, but they fell behind. And on the third night, another storm struck and the waves stood tall. Chimqua was separated from her cubs. She too was very tired as she searched for her cubs. Finally, she moved on, hoping that she would find them on the shores of the (speaking foreign language), which means the great lake. It was the fourth day when Chimqua finally saw the sands and the forest of the land ahead, but her cubs were not with her and she was sad. Chimqua dragged herself onto the sands of the beach and shook the waters from her fur. She was so weary. She wanted to sleep, yet she searched the shore for her lost cubs. When she could not find them, she rested always watching the vast waters, but she would not, could not eat. She waited for many days. Her cubs did not come, but still she remained. Finally, one day, as the faithful mother waited, the great spirit Manitou, who is wise and created all things, took pity on her. Manitou had join Chimqua and her lost cubs in the spirit world. Again, the mother and her cubs were happy. The spirit Manitou was so moved by the love and faithfulness he saw that he raised the two cubs out of the deep waters and made them islands which he named after himself. In honor of Chimqua, who waited so patiently, he covered the place where she laid with mounds of sand so that forever all people and animals would know the greatness of the sleeping bear. These islands, sands, and waters are home to people of many cultures. Home to insects, the animals, the birds, and the fish. Life in the Earth, on the Earth, in the air, and in the water. (speaking foreign language) And all those who know the story of Chimqua and her cubs know that life is blessed because of her faithfulness and her love. (audience applauding) (all cheering) - [Mike] I can't believe this actually worked! I was so nervous. (audience applauding) (light orchestral music) Boy, what dad did for us this summer was really something. - That's pretty much what happened. - That was a great summer. - You did what you had to do, son. - Worked out, didn't it? Seems like 100 years ago. But I should've made more of an effort to stay in touch. - I wasn't very available, was I? You keep looking at your watch. - It's getting late. It's almost eight. - You're leaving? - I've got a room in town. I'll come by in the morning sometime. - Oh good, good. - I love you, dad. - I love you too. (light orchestral music) (sobs) I love you too. Who's this? - This is the rest of my family. - Oh, you're Lindsey. - Hi, grandpa. - Oh Lindsey. And you're Beth. - [Beth] Hi, dad. - You're wonderful, all of you. Thank you son. - [Ted] My stubborn old dad avoided his family pretty much his whole life. It's gonna take some time for us to deal with that, but we were all on the same page that day. Falling off the ladder somehow helped him realize what he'd missed out on. This was a really good thing for our family. For Mike, Lindsey, Beth, and I'm really thankful that my dad finally had the opportunity to say hello.
