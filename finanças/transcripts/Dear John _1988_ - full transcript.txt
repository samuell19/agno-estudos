[music playing] [suspenseful music] [ominous music] [bells ringing] [bonging sound] [footsteps clacking] [intense music] [geese honking] [making gun noises] [suspenseful music] [airplane flying overhead] [suspenseful music] [making gun sounds] [accordion music] Where are we darling? Don't you know? Paris. Why Paris? Romance is always something else. Watch your own feet, not on mine. I've never been there. That's perfect. It has to be right, just right. Yes, Paris in the summer. And one, two, three and dip. I can't. It's just not me and this sure ain't Paris. Oh, how are you ever be a lady if you can't dance? Oh, haven't you ever seen two ladies dancing together before? Maybe he's been to Paris. Our time will come. One of these nights he will arrive in a-- what to they drive there? Right, it doesn't matter. The door will swing open and he'll beckon you win. And you'll slide into the plush upholstery and he'll take you dancing and-- [organ notes] [music playing] Romance has arrived. Hiya honey. Hard day at the office? We can offer you a deal tonight, Party for $75, single for $50. What'll it be? We're fading fast. You alone for $40. That's not very businesslike. It's a joke. [organ music] OK, OK, $50. [organ music] [sirens] [MUSIC - You've made up your mind. But I hope that you'll see it, it happens this way every time. You think you're a fool to keep staying on. But I hope you won't say goodbye. You'll just be-- CONNIE: Miserable night out there isn't it? It's like this, the world feels very small. Starts to close in on you like being trapped in an elevator. Yeah. Fries, no gravy. Fries, hold the sauce. [music lyrics] I'd be so lonely here without you. CONNIE: Sure is black out there. [music lyrics] So just drink on up. CONNIE: Your awfully wet, aren't you? Like it's kind of late to be out isn't it? Oh, not that I'm prying or anything. But, well, I work here only at night. I rarely see anybody except maybe the boys. Are my fries ready? Sorry, but I thought it being late and nothing to do. Yeah, they're ready. Here. Do you want to talk? No. CONNIE: You look like you've been through a war. I know just how you feel. When I first started working here, my fiance left me for the fries cook at Mac's down the street. They're only up until 10. Well, he said he couldn't stand the hours, mine that is, as though he had to work them. I like the nights here. So now he's down at Mac's doing salads. What really hurt, other than having to give back the diamond, was that the cook is a man. I tried explaining it to mother . She had her heart set on a gig Ukrainian wedding. But she just couldn't understand so it was easier just to stop talking. How much is it for a refill? $0.25. Do you think I talk too much for waitress? My boss put me on nights-- Could I have that refill? Sure and I've got some fresh stuff just brewed. My fiance always complained about my coffee. He said it was better when it sat there all day. He likes to complain about everything, coffee, the weather. He doesn't even like coffee. You talk too much. Are you in some kind of trouble? Because if you are, maybe I can help. I just live around the corner unless you're allergic to cats. Because I've got a lot. They keep me company. Some people say that-- Shut up. Give me my bill. No, you can't go out there. [lightning and thunder] CONNIE: I'll get you something dry to wear, then we'll talk. [music lyrics] I spend my time waiting for hours on end. It-- Just a clean, eh? Think you're playing games with some low life fag? Like-- Ah. Well. It's about time you paid me for services rendered. I just thought-- You just thought what? That I was a lonely little woman waiting for my prince to come along and save me? Well, maybe I am. But until then, you pay. Well, thanks Herb or do you like to be Herbert? Explain that to the little wifey. - TRUCKER 1: Do You have a 10? TRUCKER 2: No, Go fish. Any eights? Do I have an eight? Diamonds. Ha. [glass breaking] CONNIE: All right, do you have a seven? TRUCKER 2: Go fish. CONNIE: Aha. TRUCKER 1: Do you have a five? CONNIE: What's this? Ah, fellas, excuse me OK? That'll be $1.95. I won't charge you for the extra coffee. It's on me. You can keep the sweater. And if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here just about every night. [traffic noise] Nice morning for a walk. A ride? Would you like a ride? [chickens clucking] Where you headed? The waterfront. [fiddle music] [chickens clucking] [fiddle music] Sal, my name's Sal. This is my brother Bert. So what's your name? Janet. My name's Janet. [chickens clucking] [fiddle music] [chickens clucking] [traffic noise] BERT: Well, where'd you say you lived again? I didn't. Hey, wait. No, you can't drive me home. I live with my sister. She wouldn't understand if I came home in a truck. You best be getting going then. She'll have breakfast ready. [chickens clucking] [baby crying] [squeaking] [traffic noise] Wh-- where were you? You said, me-- me-- meet me later at the club. I w--w-- waited like a fool. Like a fool? I-- is-- is that wh-- what you take me for? Drop it. I-- I-- went with someone else. Wh-- Did I leave you there? Why didn't you go home? Wh-- Available young men you fantasize about and say to them, are you alone? Ah, would you like to dance, maybe a drink, or how about haven't I seen you somewhere before? S-- s-- stop it. You ma-- ma-- the date. Yes. And I happened to meet somebody who thought it would be nice if I was Brania. Your-- your lying. Yo-- you-- you probably f-- forgot. Well, why don't-- why don't you-- you just admit it. Rocket, admit it. Is that what you want to hear that I stood you up and now you're playing the part of the housewife. And you're a mad housewife. Well, I don't want to play anymore. Hey. Hey. [knocking] [traffic noise] The cat ha-- has fleas. I--I-- I was going-- I-- I was going to-- I was going to fee-- feed it. Bu--bu-- but you-- but you locked your door. It-- it-- it-- it was hungry. Wh-- wh-- why did-- why did-- why did you lock your door? You know, I-- I was at-- at-- at the bar tonight and-- and I had on my r-- red shirt with the roses. And-- and I felt really beautiful just waiting like y--you were going to come on-- on a date. Some date. [knocking] Di--di-- did-- did--did you say-- say-- said tonight? So--so-- somebody said that they--they-- they-- they saw him going into one of those pre-- pre-- pre-- preppy bars. [traffic noise] [knocking] Wo-- would you-- would you have an-- an-- another one-- an-- another one of those? An endless supply and apparently so does the corner store. [traffic noise] D-- do--do-- do you-- do you think he's a-- le-- le-- Left you? You didn't take him seriously, did you? W-- we-- we were d-- doing f-- f-- Fine? Help yourself to a beer. George, you are one blind fag. You're asking too much for someone that slides in and out of cars. Wh-- what I do wi--with tricks has--has-- has noth-- nothing to do with an-- anything. How How romantic. Wh-- what--what-- what am I going to do-- do now? We--we were so go--go-- go-- ROCKET: You were great. Romeo and Juliet. You're no-- not listening. I'm listening. But-- but-- you're-- you're-- you're-- you're not f--f-- feeling any--any-- anything. I'm listening but I'm not hearing anything different from the last time. They're taking you for a ride. Get it, a ride. A short pleasure cruise with a fag. It's-- no-- not like that. It's not. Ten exotic fun-filled days and then home to safety. He was just trying it out. [traffic noise] [music playing] Morning. [music playing] We don't have much time. Ah, I'll just have the usual. [music playing] Is he clean? Yeah, I had him scanned when he came in. You can't be too careful. [music playing] George, I want to talk to you. [knocking] George. George, let me in. George, are you in there? [sax music] I bought he, I can build my whole house with it. Here's $50 bucks. I'm calling you in. No, no, wait a minute. I own all of these. Go. SID: You can't build a house on a railroad. GAME PLAYER: Here's $150 bucks I'm giving you only. I hear it's over, all finished between you and George. Sid, it's all just a game to you. But to George, ah, forget it. [sax music] Georgie Porgie pudding and pie, kissed the girls and made them cry. When the boys came out to play, Georgie Porgie ran away. SID: Who's turn is it? Mr. Railway. [music playing] Hey. How much? How much you got? I charge a little extra for that. $50? $75. OK. get in. [car engine running] [dogs barking] ROCKET: So why'd you pass him up, a nice clean man? Probably has two kids, a home in the burbs, you know the type. JANET: What's it to you? You're taking my customers and you scaring them off. We don't do that. One, just one jerk, and I didn't even-- ROCKET: Word gets around though and I'm running a business here, not a hobby. I can't run home to mummy when things don't go my way. So exactly what are you're looking for? No answer, eh? If you're going to work my corner, then you're going to get to know me, and you're going to answer my questions. I didn't come here to make friends. Ha, ha, so now I know what you didn't come here for. Did you come here to make money? Because it won't be so easy. Nothing is so what's new? ROCKET: OK, you're on your own. But you know, sometimes it'll seem easy. Those guys will just want a little bit of you. But other times, they're going to want a whole lot of you. So where you going to be, in the back seat? And just what the fuck are you looking for out there? Well, let's say it all started in a gas station in the middle of nowhere. There was a little boy named Douglas after his grandad, a military man. And there was a mummy who dreamed of being Rita Hayworth. And she hated Douglas and she hated the gas station. It's all the same thing to her. And Douglas's dad, well, he worked his ass off for those two in the middle of nowhere. Douglas wanted to escape but when the bell rang, he'd go running to the car and say, how much, sir? He'd put the pump in, hold it down, release when full, put the cap back on. Thank you, sir. Goodbye. And he'd do it again and again. That's a boring story. Yeah, it was boring. Do you want to hear the end? No. Well, anyways, Douglas had to escape. So when a car came through. That was heading for the big city, he got a ride and he left and has never been back. [jazz music] Have you seen George? Not recently. Hi. ROCKET: Easy honey. She's not your type. How do you know what type I like? I use my intuition and my eyes. I don't think I'm anyone's type here. [jazz music] Hey. She with you? I-- I didn't know y-- y-- were into little girls anymore or did you bring her fo-- I'll pretend I didn't hear that. [jazz music] Janet, may I present Jane. There's a little bit of Tarzan in there too. And here we have Sid. He thinks he's normal. And George, he obviously doesn't like little girls. Where's the can? [jazz music] So everything's fine is it? [jazz music] Yeah, everything's f-- f-- f-- fine, absolutely. Wh--wh-- what-- what do you care? [jazz music] JOE-ANNE: Look, mister, go back and have another drink. You can't follow me in here honey. This is the ladies room. Ah, come on. There-- there ain't no ladies. The last time I saw a lady in here was 1945. You're no judge. And you can't be that old. So just get your ass out. JOHN 1: You calling me an ass? I'll show you-- Wait out there. What do you want to do, hold my hand or something? I need both hands. So just back off will you? [music playing] JOE-ANNE: Could you pass me some toilet paper honey? I'm completely out. [music playing] What a savior. My luck to walk into a can with nothing. [music playing] Could you believe that guy? He can't take his hands off me. Thinks he can follow me in here. Now, tell me, honestly, is this too much? What do you think? It looks OK. Maybe the dress is a little sh-- short. Cost me a fortune, it did. Hardly anything to it but expensive. When I walk down the street, I cause accidents. Guys go crazy. Has Rocket spoken to you? Who? What a little eyeliner could do for you. Oh, yeah, we've met. Shame. When you got it, you don't use it. Got what? Looks honey, looks. Never stare. Didn't your mother ever teach you that? It's rude. You look ridiculous. Ravishing, the word is ravishing. It took me weeks to find this outfit, weeks. I mean a girl should be able to wear whatever she wants, whatever is attractive without every lout in town drooling over her. But then why wear them at all? Do you tango? [tango music] You're all men. What makes you think that? You should be able to tell what a man is. Don't you know? Is that what a man feels like? I don't know. What do you mean? Honey, why don't you go get yourself a drink? [tango music] Rocket, is-- is-- she moving in to-- too? Let's not talk, just dance. [tango music] Here we are. [music playing] You know, you have a real knack, kid. Too bad you're not a man. Why does it matter so much? Nothing else about matters. [music playing] The problem is we can't both follow, someone has to lead. [piano music] Are you going far? No, not far. Well, drop by sometime. The party never ends. [piano music] [door buzzer] ROCKET: Do you know what time it is? It's 3:00 o'clock in the morning, time for my beauty sleep so speak up or I-- Where's the party? ROCKET: Who am I talking to? I though you said there was a party. I couldn't sleep so I thought I drop by. You said to. I suppose I did say you could come over. I just don't mean tonight. Maybe I'll just go then. Come on. You look like you could use a party. [music playing] How did you get here? I ran away just like everybody does. I didn't run away. I left home. There's a difference. Really? [tv voices] I mean, how did you get to this point? You know what I mean. Do you want to know when I decided to act like a woman? Is that it? [tv voices] When did it start for you? Silly, I was born this way. Hm. That's how I feel. I was a stripper when I-- when I first hit town. [tv voices] I had them drooling. There I was, the most beautiful woman, at least for that moment. And I twisted and I wiggled for them. They were mine. [tv voices] But after three years of that, even I couldn't believe it. [tv voices] Besides that was as far as I could go before the magic would disappear. [tv voices] I guess that doesn't really answer your question. If I could answer that one, maybe I wouldn't be here. [tv voices] They all look like Joe-Anne. There his chi-- children, his ugly chi--chi-- children but loved. They don't look like children at all. R-- R--Ro-- Rocket would have made a good m--mother. You-- you know the kind in--in-- in a station wagon who-- who--who takes her kids to--to hockey and-- and--and sits-- and sits in the stands and cheers and--and makes cookies. With my hair in curlers and an insurance salesman for a husband. Maybe I would have made a good housewife. D-- d-- do you-- do you know-- know how-- how to make co-- cookies? Nah, no cookies. You have to make them feel comfortable, just smile, and lean right in, and take a good look around the car. And ask them if they want some company. And be discreet. What are you laughing at? Do you want to make more money or are-- are you just for the good times? You try it. How old is this guy? Old enough. Well, what am I looking for? ROCKET: Drugs, weapons. How about a doll, a big one? ROCKET: Have you been with that guy? Hi, d--do you want ah-- Yes, I do. Why don't you get in? $50 bucks mister. [car driving off] [car engine coming] [harmonica music] What now? Do-- do--do you-- Run. Run. [ominous music] Yeah hoo, woo. [ominous music] OK, move it. Move it, woo hoo. [ominous music] Agh. [ominous music] Oh. Ah. [thump] [ominous music] Get up. [birds chirping] [phone rings] ROCKET (VOICE MAIL): Leave a message. If you're lucky, I'll call you back. [beep] SGT. PEARLY (ON PHONE): My name is Detective Pearly. Hello, what can I do for you? Mm, what happened? Mm. Yes. Yeah, yeah, I can. As soon as I can. Downtown? OK. PRIEST: Let us pray. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for he that believeth in me, yet he die, yet shall he live. We therefore commit to the earth the body of George Henry Gladstone. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in the sure and certain resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. [birds chirping] [crows cawing] [birds chirping] Georgie Porgie pudding and pie. Sh. Kissed the girls and made them cry. [birds chirping] [crows cawing] [birds chirping] JANET: He thinks you're the bereaved girlfriend. So. Sorry. It's misleading. He's going home thinking that his son-- His son what? That you were his girlfriend. Well, I was. [birds chirping] JANET: I just think that somebody ought to tell him the truth instead of dressing up and pretending. [birds chirping] [music playing] Ah. Has Rocket come back yet? No. [music playing] You know, he really did like him. JANET: I know. I do not. Are you cheating again? Honest to God. OK, OK, ask me, ask me. All right, all right. Queen, queen? No. I haven't got any big numbers for God sakes. Yeah, yeah, I know. You know that. Hot player. You leaving us? - Sure, I am. I'm going to serve some coffee tonight. Well, yeah, you gotta to work I guess. Watch those cards. So what about aces, you got aces? CUSTOMER: Nope. [MUSIC - to be since you walked out-- Maybe I should be pouring you a glass of milk. Hm. [MUSIC - Now you're gone and life-- Come all this with for conversation? You're a ways from home aren't you? Just what have you been doing to yourself? Working. Looking for a better job? One of the day girls is getting married, although I don't know why. They've been living together for years. I was on the funeral today. Connie, we sure would like some more coffee. [MUSIC - You said that you loved me, then walked out-- Those two keep trying to pick me up. [MUSIC - My heart still aches to this day. You last words-- [piano music] Ethics, yes, very important. What would we do without them? Absolutely nothing. I work my ass off every day. You, know, my wife says, it doesn't matter what you do as long as you make money at it. Sounds like she's got the right attitude. I'd like to see her on the street working her ass off. [piano music] He wants to have babies too, seriously. He wants to have dolls, not babies. No, really he does. I think he'd be a good mother too. We need more of those. I must've been around eight or nine when I got it into my head I wanted to be a boy. I have six brothers. They all ended up in construction. They made a pile of money killing themselves. Now, they each own a house in the suburbs with furniture all covered in plastic. Sounds practical. Practical? You can't even feel the texture of the fabric. Every time I go over there, they whisk me down to the rec room. No one ever uses the living room. It's like bloody mausoleum. [MUSIC - Oh, I love you. Goodbye. Please don't cry. Did I said something wrong? Sounds OK to me what your brothers have got. FEMALE TRUCKER 1: Hey, hon, you think we could get the bill please? [music playing] Thanks a lot. CONNIE: Thanks. See you soon. Great card game. FEMALE TRUCKER 2: Yeah, really. CONNIE: Bye. FEMALE TRUCKER 2: Bye. [MUSIC - Since I lost you-- [truck engine] There's a full moon coming. Nights like this, my mother, God rest her soul, she used to look out the window. Near the end she would only sit near the window. She blamed it all on the moon whether you could see it or not. I think she just needed something to blame. [MUSIC - Sorry then walked out on me. And my heart is ached to this day. Your last words I still on the answering machine. I love you-- [footsteps on stairs] I didn't think you were interested in girls. Not usually. When I was 10 one Christmas, I entered this contest where you can win a helicopter ride with Santa. I didn't believe in him or anything. I just wanted the ride in the helicopter. I thought it'd be different. So to win, you had to guess how many stores were in the shopping mall. Not hard, eh? I'm telling the truth. So me and--and these three guys that I knew from school, really jerks, got stuffed into this helicopter with the smelliest Santa. He'd been drinking and I had to sit on his lap. The ride was fun and everything. It's just that Santa kept squeezing me and running his hand up my jacket. And I was scared. And I thought that if I had made a scene or anything, we would crash. So I just let him touch me. Mm, where is this heading? I don't know. I just thought if when he touched me, I thought I recognized him. I'm sure he ran the bowling alley. It was the outfit, it just confused me. ROCKET: Do I confuse you? Yeah. Sometimes it's like being with a woman. And sometimes-- What about now? What about now? I don't know. I'm just not sure what's going on. It's not as if I'm not interested. Forget it. Santa will now take off in his little chopper. He never meant it. But he did mean it. Do you think he knew what he was doing? Yeah. Well, I don't know what I'm doing. This isn't what you want. I want a small house with big trees all around it, furniture with plastic on it so that the kids can play. I want two kids, one dark, one fair and always happy. And I want to be just like you when I grow up. It's your turn now. I don't think he's going to like this. Why not? He needs a party. We all need a party. Birthdays are not his thing, especially his own. We definitely need some of these. [traffic noise] He's afraid of getting old. Birthdays just remind him he's not always going to look convincing. There's nothing worse than an old drag queen. STORE CLERK: Hey, you gonna buy that or what? [traffic noise] Surprise. Hey. [party whistles] [interposing voices] Smile. Let's not ruin their fun. Who's fucking idea was this? I had absolutely nothing to do with it, just an innocent bystander. However, I did blow up all the balloons. You of all people know I hate parties. Just take it. Don't be so damn rude. SID: Let's have some music. This is a song for those who believe in true love. [rock and roll] Have you got anymore of those? [music playing] Say you want me to come on captain, come on and love me so hard. The only time like that shit called love. All I want is a good time. Come on [inaudible]. We both know [inaudible] Just play along and [inaudible] [interposing voices] JOE-ANNE: Meet Mr. Perfect. SID: He'll like this. Are you sure you've got the right man? Yeah. I know it's not your usual style, but I thought it might be fun. Something different. Well, it's not fun. Why did you do this? Don't take it so seriously. I did it-- shit, can't we just pretend something else for tonight? I'm not sure I can. Then don't. Sorry I made a mistake. [music playing] Think you can manage? I've worn high heels all my life. [music playing] JOE-ANNE: Hot stuff. SID: Whoa. Woo, fix you up Rocket. Hey, neat. [music playing] Clothes aren't going to change anything. I know. I just-- [music playing] TAXI DRIVER: Night like this you don't want to be in it, full moon. My husband says a full moon is bad news. Someone's got to work thought. I'm not boring you am I? I don't listen to him thought. If I believed everything that man said, I'd never move off the couch. Cold work, eh, if you call it work. Ah, it's a job though, just a job. Could do worse. It's too busy here. It's too busy for a full moon. You know, if they checked all the records, they'd find that all the really horrible things happen during the full moons. Like my cousin, last Christmas had a seizure. Never had one before. For no reason at all and, sure enough, there was the moon really big and everything. SID: My mom used to bring me and my older sister here in the summer. She liked to sleep in the sun, my mom did. It made her feel beautiful, she said. She'd plop us on the sand with spoons and old pots. Yeah. Then she'd tie a piece of string to our wrists, just one wrist, and then to her ankles. What for? Then one day, my sister figured out how to untie her knot, like, one day she couldn't, the next day she could. [water lapping on shore] [seagulls calling] I watched her. She just walked straight into the water. She never even tried to swim. [seagulls calling] So what did you want to come? To lie in the sun. [seagulls calling] So, how's the beach? Still there. You should go. What would I wear? Maybe that's why you should go. You might have to make a decision. Where's Rocket? JOE-ANNE: He's out doing the laundry. He always does the laundry whenever he's upset about something. He said that getting rid of all the dirty laundry was important. JANET: Hey lady, do you need all these machines? I only need one. Take anything you want, honey. I will, don't worry, I will. So where were ya? Why didn't you come with us? Lady, what the hell are you doing? Do you mind telling me what's going on? I go to the beach and you're in here doing the laundry. Just what would I do it beach? What everybody else does. Can you tell me why that's so possible for you? ROCKET: You know, the package says you should use a whole cup. They just say that so you use more and then you have to buy more and spend more. I don't think this is going to work out. I found if you use half the amount of soap and warm water, it works just fine. No sticky residue. Is that so damn important? Yes. Well, let's take a look at you. Oh, you have the bush for weeks. Oo. I don't see any pretty girls out there. I want-- I want the little one. Shit, is she a sight for sore eyes. Oo. She is cute. Hey, haven't we met before? Yeah, we've met. Hey, are you going to be OK? Yeah, I'm just not in the mood to play tag. Don't worry. He pays well. Hey, let's go. Hey, hey, pretty lady, you did three ways? Yeah, sure. You're cute, the both of you. Sarah, hey, Sarah look who's here. Say hi to Sarah. Hi Sarah. This is it for tonight. I'll give you a ring and talk with you. Where we headed? Do you like surprises? I do. Sure. It's your money. If you like surprises then so do I. I must cost you a fortune playing these games. What are you making money at? [thunder rolling] Thunder storms, yeah. Oh, that's terrific. Yeah, that's good. Oo. Now, ah-- open the glove compartment, just a part of my little surprise. I've never done this before. HUNTER: Ah, well, ah-- how much extra? I'll-- I'll pay. It's ah-- it's just a part of my little surprise. Put it on. [wipers squeaking] This will cost you a lot. You never answered my question. Where we headed? HUNTER: Nope. What difference does it make where we do this? It seems to work-- Shut up. [wipers squeaking] I don't want to hear another word. [wipers squeaking] HUNTER: Be like Sarah. She usually doesn't talk. She doesn't need explanations. She doesn't need to know what this or why not. [wipers squeaking] She's quiet. [wipers squeaking] Too many words. [wipers squeaking] But you know, she-- she doesn't scream. Ah, but nobody's perfect, no. [wipers squeaking] We try but ah-- the words just get in the way. [wipers squeaking] [lightning and thunder] Sorry. Yeah, Sarah. HUNTER (SINGING): There was blood on the saddle. There was blood all around. And a great big puddle of blood on the ground. Don't. Don't spoil it. Look at Sarah. She's quiet. Let go. [wipers squeaking] [thunder rolling] What do you think Sarah? [wipers squeaking] I know. HUNTER (SINGING): There was blood on the saddle. Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm. In a great big puddle of blood on the ground. Has anybody been dropped off here recently, a girl In a pickup truck? [music ] Hey, oh, oh. Oh, wow, wow. You don't fool me. [music] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Wow, wow, wow. Rise and shine. We're just stopping for gas. I just gotta use the can. OK. It's right over there. But no messing up our surprise. You're just going to the can, then you coming right back here, and then we're going to leave. Smile. The key, do you have the key? Could I use the phone? There's a payphone out by the road. As long as it's local. JANET (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hi. It's me. I'm still with that Hunter guy. I don't if this is really worth it. So I'll see you later. Ah. Let go. Let go. [tape rewinding] JANET (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hi, it's me. I'm still with that Hunter guy. I don't know if this is really worth it. So I'll see you later. Ah. [tape rewinding] JANET (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hi. It's me. I'm still with that Hunter guy. I don't know if this is really worth it. So I'll see you later. Ah. Or anything like what? It's just that I'm going to be late in getting back. Get-- getting back. Yeah, I suppose you will. [traffic noise] [music playing] Quiet in here, isn't it? It's early. Oh, two of the regulars to go and maybe a couple of them there, nah, make it three of them there muffins. Me and the wife, we're going hunting. Oh yeah? Yeah, going hunting. [music playing] Not much hunting around here. [music playing] So, where are we headed? Straight down this highway and you turn right on number 22. You're the one that's been here before so why are you asking? You know what I mean. What are we going to do? We'll figure it out when we get there. JOE-ANNE: I'm scared. Everything is dangerous, just walking down the street can get you killed. So, you're going to make a career out of this, are you? Look who's talking. You dressed like a fucking secretary. Sir, can I take some dictation. And what would you like in your coffee. And ah-- how about a little something that the wife won't do. Shut up. Just keep to yourself. Get out. I don't need this. If I could be a fucking secretary, maybe I'd be one. It'd be a hell of a lot better than pretending in the back seat of some jerk's car. What's your problem? I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Nothing seems right. It never was. You just wanted it to seem right. Close the door. Your mascara is running. You look like hell, you know. Give me your car for a while. Careful. [music playing] [birds chirping] What I say. [birds chirping] Just a little hunt first. Well, where are we? Why couldn't we have done this a little closer downtown? [birds chirping] ROCKET: It's been a long time since I was in the country. I went riding the day I left never realizing it would be my last. The sky was really dark and foreboding. How romantic. Now did you remember what the sign said? [birds chirping] Here are the rules. You've got until I've blown up little Sarah here. What do you mean? I don't even know where I am. Yeah. You don't know where you are. Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this? Why are you doing this? [birds chirping] You've got maybe five minutes. [birds chirping] [balloon doll being blown up] [birds chirping] [OMINOUS MUSIC AND BIRDS CHIRPING] [clicking noises] [birds chirping] [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] Agh. [birds chirping] [air leaving tire] [OMINOUS MUSIC AND BIRDS CHIRPING] [whisperings] [birds chirping] [ominous music] [birds chirping] [ominous music] [whisperings] [ominous music] [water running] [whisperings] [ominous music] [making gun noises] Agh. HUNTER: Oo, ha, ha. Yes, sir. Dead on, dead on. Best shot I had all season. Don't touch me. Hey, hey, I--I-- I won. I won. Don't mess it up. Come on. Does this mess it up? HUNTER: Co--come on. This is what you like asshole. No. Sa-- Sarah. Run. JANET: Come here asshole. What's your name? My name is John. My name's John. Yeah? Well, my name's Janet. - Ah. My name's Janet. Did you hear that? It's Janet. It's Janet. Did you hear me? - Let him go. - It's Janet. No Janet. It's Janet. It's me. My name's Janet. It's Janet. Did you hear that? - Come on. He's not doing anything. It's Janet. Come on. [birds chirping] [harmonica music] [birds chirping] [gun shot] [crows cawing] [birds chirping] [music playing] [string music] [ballroom dance music] [piano music]
