I see Mount Hood every day when I go to work, when I come home from work. I believe that there are stories in the land. And when we are quiet enough and still enough, we can experience that energy in a deeper way. Coming out and climbing Mount Hood are incredibly similar in the fact that they're both pretty hard climbs. I want to climb Mount Hood because I want to be a part of a team of queer climbers. And climbing something that is within all of our backyards is beautiful. Standing on the summit of Mount Hood, the highest point in Oregon at 11.245 feet, is a lifelong dream for many aspiring mountaineers. This mountain was first known as Wy'east. The ancestral lands of the Multnomah, Kalapuya, and Molalla people, among others. Mount Hood attracts more than 10.000 climbers a year. Making it the most visited snow-covered peak in America. Mount Hood is the second most climbed mountain in the world. Second only to Japan's holy Mount Fuji. John Muir wrote that Mount Hood gives a supreme touch of grandeur to all the main Columbia views. Rising at every turn, solitary, majestic, awe-inspiring, the ruling spirit of the landscape. In the fall of 2018, a small group from the LGBTQ community decided they wanted to summit Mount Hood. My name is Ryan Stee. I'm 44. And I'm gay for dudes. Hi. I'm Shanita King. I am 44 years old and I'm queer. My name is Stacey Rice. I'm 61 years old. And I'm transgender. Holy shit. My name is Taylor Feldman and I'm a 28-year-old queer woman. "Who's on top?" becomes an anthem for the group. The four will go through the process and define what "Who's on top?" means for each of them. This is kind of old coffee, is it? 1 liter. What is that? Good morning. How are you? I'm ready to go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I already made my first faux paus. That's right. I told you, I have the same jacket. So for our trip to summit Mount Hood, it's an early start. It's what we call an alpine start and we leave at about midnight. And alpine starts can range any time between midnight and 4:00 AM. Any time when you really shouldn't be awake. I usually try to catch a few hours of sleep at the trailhead before I go up on a climb. So at least I have a few hours of rest under my belt. Usually that means sleeping in my car or camping next to my car or something at the trailhead. It takes about an hour for me, typically, to get my boots on and get my head in the game. Prepping everything before you start to ascend. And you're doing in the middle of the night. So your brain is already a little foggy. So it's really important to be super organized ahead of time so that you're not trying to figure out where one of your remaining carabiners are at 12:30am in the morning. I don't know. We'll be ascending the south side of Mount Hood. And for the first third or so, it's a ski resort. And so climbers have a special groomed path over to the right side of the ski resort that we will walk up. I'm sure we won't be the only ones on the mountain that day. Fridays leading into the weekend are typically, a pretty busy day. Especially if it's supposed to be nice weather. It'll be completely dark. Hopefully there will be moonlight or starlight and we'll have good views. But for the most part, you're just looking at the small little orb of light that's in front of you from your headlamp. Based on the 1:00 AM start time, the team should arrive at the Silcox Hut at 2:30 AM. As they make their way up the mountain, they will have to manage a consistent marathon pace. Their physical endurance, heat management, and mental fitness will be tested. By 5:00 AM, they should be on top of the Palmer lift. 6:30 AM is the targeted time for getting to Devil's Kitchen. The team plans to summit by 8:00 AM. Then you want to get off of there pretty soon after sunrise. Because mountains are held together by snow and water and ice and you want it to be as solid as possible. One climber died on Tuesday after falling at least 700 feet on Oregon's Mount Hood. I want to summit Mount Hood, but there are some risk factors and some dangers. Mount Hood has taken another life. A climber from Idaho was killed when he fell there just this morning. I am aware of the dangers of summiting Mount Hood. Mount Hood, of course, no stranger to tragedy involving climbers. Tragically, four people died there last year. The dangers of summiting Mount Hood doesn't scare me. Those concerns are pretty small compared to be able to stand on top of Mount Hood. I think that would be pretty awesome cool, I think. I'm a climbing guide and so I've climbed Mount Hood three times, on three different routes, three different times in the season over the past couple of years. And climbed a lot of other volcanoes. Well aware of all the risks involved. I don't necessarily see a big spirit of inclusivity in mountaineering. It's a pretty white male-dominated sport. I think in mountaineering, there's, sort of, an old guard of older men that are a little bit of gatekeepers on the mountain and may not make people feel welcome. It's hard, though. Because mountaineering, a lot of the time, you'll have so many layers on you can't tell who's who. So in that way, it's safer for people who look different. You can hide a little bit, I guess, but I don't want that to be the case. I don't want people to feel like they have to hide themselves in order to feel comfortable in the outdoors. That goes against my entire mission of why I lead trips and the way that I operate trips. When I grew up and probably the age I grew up, I noticed things have changed a lot in the gay community. If I could pass as straight, if I could be straight-acting, that was, like, a crown achievement. I personally find it really inspiring when I see someone who's very out in the outdoors. I'm like, yes. You are like me. And I think that that's really important for the future of the sport. White cis males can't run the show forever. Sorry, guys. This painting is one of my most vulnerable pieces that I've worked on. She's expressing something in a very powerful way. To me, having the courage to use my voice and to have the courage to work through some of the fears that I've been limited by in my existence. When I began doing my meditative art practice for myself, I began working with the heart. Visually it's very pleasing. I like the curves. I'm originally from South Carolina. Any time I'm in nature, I get floods of creativity and inspiration for drawing and painting. It also makes me think about my ancestors that have passed away. And just feeling a little bit closer to them. Since I've been in Portland, I've been really finding my creative voice. Created many murals. The day before the 4th of July, I was painting a mural on Alberta Street. Two men walked past me while I was painting and made a couple of remarks. They were like nice job, or something like that. And two hours later, the same two men come back. And they're like staggering and red-faced at this point and reeked of alcohol. They started just saying all of these inappropriate racial slurs to me. And I felt very unsafe and uncomfortable. And I'm trying not to engage with them. And so as I'm in the process of packing up my things, I get knocked over onto the sidewalk. His whole body slammed into mine. I immediately got up and they were both laughing at what had just happened. And I went inside the building. They ended up leaving before the police got there. It was very frightening. And I didn't want to actually, go back to work on my mural for like a month after that because I was afraid. Mount St. Helens, right after that big storm in March, John, I need a pep talk. What do you need to hear? That it's OK to go at a slower pace. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's totally OK to go at a slower pace. Like Amber was saying yesterday, the goal is to hit that, sort of, steady pace where you can still hold the conversation, but keep moving forward. And trying to, like, build up the the mental Maybe baby steps while we talk? Yeah. Yeah. So just not have to take all those little break. So just motivate yourself to try to keep moving forward. Even if it's like-- Even if it's slow. Yeah. I have to make everything from scratch. Just because I have a lot of food allergies and I like cooking. I started cooking many, many years ago after my grandma, kind of, inspired me to cook. Because she was old school, depression era and she had to make everything from scratch. 30 years that they didn't have any money at all. Literally no money. So I watched her and I got inspired to cook. I'm from Prineville, Oregon. It's a small town in the middle of the state. And it was mostly lumber industry. Very blue collar. We had Les Schwab there. That's where Les Schwab actually lived there and I served him ice cream. I knew something was different when I was about five. I was pretty effeminate. And I wanted the home center, which is like the little kitchen because I wanted to play restaurant. I could set it all up and then have an earthquake. I spent a lot of time with my mom and grandmas. There's actually a point where it all changed. I remember running into one of jocks in school or whatever you call them. As a person that gets startled, I mean, I kind of screamed like a little girl. But got really scared because it startled me. And from that point, the target was put on me. From sixth grade all the way till my senior year in high school, it was relentless. Faggot and being made fun of. Every class, there was the anxiety of OK. I've got to get on the bus. Got to get through the bus ride. Got to get between the bus and class. I got to get through first period. Or third period's safe because it's just my friends and nobody wants to take that class. Lunch is safe because we can go sit in the corner. Being constantly hyper-aware and having this constant fear of are you going to get hit? Are you going to get spit on? I got spit on every day. And you don't dare tell an authority figures because it makes you look weak. By God, you're a man. You're supposed to fight. It has caused me to be anxious my entire life. I don't get to just relax like everybody else does. And-- My gosh. Ryan, happy birthday yesterday. What? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Ryan. Happy birthday to you. I don't have those anymore. You're older. My god. So old. I'm 24. Did you say 45? Aren't you 43? I'm 44. Don't age me. Sorry. ...mean you're 44. The group takes their first break 30 minutes into the journey. How are we doing, you guys? Glad we have poles. Shan, how's your tracking pole sitch'? The professionals are working on it. They are off to a slow start. Unfortunately, the first rest stop is longer than planned. As a result, they are slightly behind schedule. So just remember that every time I've done this, the sun did come out. The darkness was not ever-lasting. Getting myself ready to go. Think I'm going to put a little snack in my pocket. Got some dried chickpeas that are calling my name right now. Are you OK, Stacey? I just scratched my arm trying to get my pack on, so. Love to hike. I'm a hiker. When I came to visit Portland before I ever had even thought about moving, I just couldn't believe there was all this available. You know, I think certain places are very sacred. Whenever I'm in nature, I feel that energy so deeply. I like being in very quiet places. And I have found over time that that's when things start flooding into my mind about direction, about my place in life, where I'm at, what I'm struggling with. And that it just kind of flows. Just this kind of stream of consciousness starts coming and so I start writing. And trying to write it all down. As you can probably tell from the accent, I'm a Southern girl. I was born in the mountains of North Carolina. It's very special to grow up in the mountains. I think there's an incredible feeling that becomes part of your soul when you look at your window every day and see mountains-- Southern Appalachian Mountains, which are some of the oldest in the world. And so you can feel that energy. It really got me through a lot of my life with my journey and my struggles. I was five years old in 1962 when I realized that something just wasn't quite right in my world. The whole world saw this little cute little boy with a big smile, but I deeply knew that I was actually, a little girl inside. And it actually wasn't until I was 10 years old that I actually saw someone that was like me. We were watching television. And there was this news report about Christine Jorgensen, the most famous person in the US who had had what they called a sex change operation at that time. They had these before picture of her as a male GI soldier and here she was as this blonde bombshell that was, kind of, like these beautiful red lips. And she just looked stunning. She said when I was a little boy, I always felt like a little girl. And I could have been tipped over with a feather at that time. Because, I mean, my God. There was somebody else besides me that felt this way? I really felt I was the only one in the world that actually had this that I was dealing with. I looked around to my family to see if anybody had noticed that I had reacted so deeply. But no. They hadn't noticed that. Nobody said a word about what this story was about. I feel like on some level that she really, kind of, gave me an amazing life preserver at that time. And I always wonder all the other trans folks that she gave that to, as well. Or whether she even ever knew that. My pole doesn't stick. Not that way. You can kick this way Just keep moving left. OK. Much better. There you go. Thank you. The first time I went climbing, it was ladies climbing night in the gym in Downtown Olympia. And I convinced my college roommate to take me. And she had never climbed before, either. And I'd never been in a group of women that were all together and also supportive. And there was lots of wine and lots of chocolate and lots of raffle prizes. And everyone was so happy to be there with each other. I never really experienced that before. So I bought a membership that night. I didn't have any gear whatsoever and I borrowed a friend's shoes for a few weeks until I won a bouldering competition and won my first pair of shoes. And then I got a harness and I started top roping. And then I started lead climbing. And just, sort of, everything was trying to get to the next level so that I could do mountains. And here I am. Just doing mountains. My childhood experience was growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. I had had girlfriends in the past that, like, swapping coming out stories. And what was your coming out story? And I was like, I didn't have one. My family's really progressive. Like, we're super liberal. Didn't need it. I was kind of wrong about that. While I do have a really liberal family and I did grow up in an environment that was really supportive of gay rights and of gay marriage, it came as a shock to my family to actually hear those words. Even though I'd assume that they knew already. I was wrong. It did create a conflict for a little while. Mostly with my mom. Using the word queer is hard for her. Because I think it's a generational shift of using the word queer nowadays, as sort of an overarching word for the LGBTQ movement and members of that community. And for her, it was like it was a horrible word to use. It was like saying the N-word for her. And so it's been a big challenge for her to use the word queer to describe me. I think probably what was part of the problem in the first place, not telling her about people that I was dating actually encouraged the belief that I was just dating men. I mean, we didn't speak for a little while. And I really needed her during that time. And it took a while for me to open back up to her. To feel like I could trust her, again. Trust her response. I don't know at what point I really, like, fully trusted her, again, or trusted our relationship, but it definitely took a while. Several years. And as you can see, I'm still hurt about it. Coordinate with the guides and get... gear and communicate with the clients on where to be. And... when we'll be there. And that's full-time? Mountaineering is a team sport. The pace is set by the slowest team member. And splitting up makes summiting a challenge. How are you doing, Ryan? My toes are a little cold. Just a little cold. Toes? There's no, like, little fireplace for my toes doing this. I'd like to keep going a little bit more to keep warm. I tend to heat up and cool down fast. Whoops. And then you fall in the snow. It's good. It's all good. The guides are starting to feel a bit uneasy about the pace. I, personally, don't feel comfortable doing that because that'll take me out of alignment with my pace. Because I'll feel pressured. From the people behind me that are probably faster. Just know that I'm going to be slow, but I'll be steady. Climbing Mount Hood safely requires three elements of preparedness. First and foremost, the physical fitness of the team is paramount. The route to the summit is 3 and 1/2 miles long, with an elevation gain of more than 5.000 feet. This is a daunting endeavor. And becomes increasingly difficult as climbers descend into elevations of decreased oxygen. A summit is only halfway, as climbers still must descend safely. Most injuries occur during the descent. When climbers are physically and mentally exhausted. Secondly, there are technical mountaineering skills which are required for a successful climb. Skills such as snow travel using crampons, navigating glaciated terrain on rope teams, and self-arresting using an ice ax are some of the basic skills needed to summit. The third element is mental resilience. The physical exhaustion of climbing a mountain can cause people to mentally shut down. This can cause accidents and could put the team in dangerous situations. Mental training is an important part of the trip preparation. Here I was, given this opportunity to climb Mount Hood. And I was in decent shape, but I wasn't real sure that I was climbing an 11.000 foot mountain shape. It's a little bit different for everybody depending on where everyone's base level of fitness is. Some folks are going to need to focus more on cardio if they haven't introduced that into their daily life. Mostly, it's your legs. You'll see, it's like a marathon runner. They've got enormous quads. That's we're going to be like. Most of these people haven't done anything like this before. So making sure that we are preparing them ahead of time is really going to minimize the risk once we're on the mountain. I started trying to do the outlined suggested workouts, but I decided to modify and do it in ways that felt more authentic for me. I've been working out about seven to nine times a week. Stairmaster. My yoga practice. Doing stairs at the stadium. Strength exercises. Just finding as many opportunities as I can for walking and hiking. And then also going to my gym as much as possible. I'm feeling really good. Really confident. Feeling really strong in my body. There's an incredible bike they have at the gym I go to that actually has like a video game on it that you can actually punch up and bike the cycle through the Mayan temples. Which is kind of fun. I'm a little nervous because I'm asthmatic. So altitude and speed are not my friend. But I've got a bunch of other people that can carry me up-- I mean, rely on-- to help me get to the top. Hiking is a foundational skill in mountaineering. As a part of the overall training program, the team got together at Powell Butte. It's one of the most beautiful hikes in Portland with views of Mount Hood. Two months before the summit, the group had their first on snow training session on Mount St. Helens, assisted by a couple of volunteer trainers. This is your spike and this is your shaft. This little aluminum thing goes through your-- what would that be called? Your "ax hole"? This is the time where we... And you're going to be really unhappy and you're going mad at Taylor for 15 minutes. And then I promise, you will forgive me. We will warm up. And instead of taking micro breaks every so often, like to adjust layers, we want to do it before we actually get cold or before we get hot, before you get sweaty as much as possible. It was a bluebird Saturday in March, with the sun out as if it were summertime. The hike up to Chocolate Falls is 2 miles, with 1.000 foot elevation gain. I actually had one meltdown on the mountain. I think I slept maybe two or three hours the night before because I was just really excited to get there and to start the training. There was one portion, my energy level was starting to get depleted. And I was starting to get overheated because I was also wearing too many layers. Taylor and I stopped and let the group go ahead of us. After I was able to reset and she was like, OK. Let's start moving at your pace. You practice yoga, why don't you sync your movements with your breath. And that clicked for me. And so from there, I began to actually do like a moving meditation. Take it more slowly when we go more at an incline. Does that sound good? Sounds great. My whole perspective with the rest of the journey shifted. And I was able to actually, be more present and to get more enjoyment out of the rest of the time at Mount St. Helens. The literal imagery for the struggles that we've all had in our lives. It could be... I never thought I'd be doing this. If they could see you now. Look at me. Is this tight? Great. This training was a way for the team to test out their gear, carry heavy packs, and traveling on snow. They learn proper ice ax handling skills, how to self-arrest, and practice repelling. Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick. Goes right up there. A part of the training for the summit climb was a group session at Evolution Fitness. The altitude room simulates an oxygen deficient environment similar to that found in mountainous environments. Training with decreased oxygen is used as a tool to trigger physiological changes in the body that are aimed at improving performance. Almost three years ago, I actually had a heart attack. My heart capacity is not what it was before my heart attack. I've been trying to work out really hard. You know, there's days that you don't want to go to the gym. For me, at least, the pressure of knowing that this is coming. You miss a day, that's one less day you've had to get yourself in shape. Alpine starts are very unnatural for most people. This is especially true for first-time mountaineers. Taylor and the volunteer trainers established a program using an alpine start to mimic the summit day. The objective of the training was to push the mental toughness of the team. Today I'm wearing haute couture tutu. And this is my summit tutu. I wear it on every climb. People think that you have to be really masculine outdoors. And I am here to tell you that you can prance your way up the mountain in style. People don't really realize that mountain climbing is such a mental game. And there's a huge physical component to it, but it's a slow sport. You are walking up a hill very, very slowly. Step, breathe. Step, breathe. And that's going to be our pace the whole time. Because we're hiking for a long time. So. And I think that, in itself, is difficult for people that are used to more high impact sports. This is like a low, slow payoff. And doing it in the middle of the night can really mess with people's emotions. People behave differently when they're sleep deprived. And you fumble. And it's cold. And it's dark. And getting used to how exactly you're packing your backpacks that you know where your headlamp is, where your snacks are, where your water is. Everything that you need for the actual day, you need to know where that system is so that you're not fumbling on the side of a mountain. Because when you do that, you're using up valuable time and energy in the middle of the night when you don't need to. And you should be like, have your system dialed for the first couple of hours of climbing until the sun rises. Until you get light and then you start to get some of that energy back before the summit, when it really matters. And getting back down. Well, we are hiking at 3:30 in the morning in the dark up towards the top of Mount Hood. The wind's blowing pretty briskly. My jaws feel very close so I don't know if more words are coming through. I kind of like the fact that you can only see so far in front of you. So you just keep plugging away and not looking up and saying, my god. There's so much more to go. No. You just have right here in front of you. So Shanita's going down. She is not feeling well today. She doesn't feel safe ascending for the rest of the night. So we're going to continue the training without her. She and Rebecca are going to chill in my car for a little while. Get a little nap. At the end, we're going to do skill building close to the lodge so she wants to stick around for that. Where's Stacey? Just beyond these trees, Silcox Hut is right at the middle mark of that. The top of Palmer is where the chairlift ends. So just to give you a little bit of perspective of how much we walked today is only up to that far. Like, things just take a lot more time. I will. In addition to mental toughness, the goal is to teach technical skills such as rope team travel and knot tying. And to build confidence traveling on snow. Long story short, but I ended up-- I got back into town yesterday, a few hours before this journey. And I did not actually have time to sleep at all. As I started progressing, I just didn't feel safe. And my vision was kind of scaring me. And so, I just had to make a decision. And I don't know why, but I'm just learning to trust my intuition. And my intuition was just giving me a really strong no. Got a little rest and was very happy to join you all. That is all. One, two, three, who's on top? Many mountaineers use rock climbing techniques to advance their alpine goals. Take it about wingspan's length of rope. Planet Granite provided an opportunity for the team to train and practice rock climbing. Lovely scarf and the carrot nose. The carrot nose. Pull them through. This training allowed the team to practice skills such as rope management, belaying with a harness, and trusting your belay partner. This was a significant experience for Stacey, as she had never done this before. The final leg to the summit of Mount Hood is steep. And poses significant danger to the climb. The team will mitigate this risk by roping up and using a belay system to get through the Pearly Gates. Rock climbing further prepares the team for this technical section. Get me down. Sliding. As a part of the training process, there is a final assessment to determine the physical strength, stamina, endurance, and to ensure that everyone can ascend at an appropriate pace. With 3 1/2 miles and 3.000 feet in elevation gain, reaching the summit at Dog Mountain in three to three and a half hours is considered the benchmark to simulate the demands of summiting Mount Hood. Ryan and Stacey set out in torrential rain to attempt to summit this small mountain. In spite of the difficult weather, Ryan and Stacey, make it to the summit in less than three hours. This is a good precedent for their Mount Hood summit. How's our pace? Right now, the thing that I'm worried about is the starting and stopping. People to find their rhythm and their temperature regulation. Thanks. Thank you. Ate a handful of those chickpeas and then I was like trying to get over the stomach feeling. The worst case, I'll puke. The team is now two hours behind. The summit guides have a meeting to evaluate the risk and feasibility of continuing to push toward the summit. One thing we were just thinking about is we've made about 500 feet in an hour. So we're way under. We're about half hour pace that we need to be. It would still probably put us short of the summit for the timing that we want to be. Right now, I don't feel 100% confident with keeping up with the pace I need to in the allotted of time. But I don't want to rob someone else of being able to summit. If you know in your brain you're not going to go full push to the summit, then you can say OK. I'm going to go for the next hour or half an hour and just go as high as I can and then enjoy the view. And that's a personal summit. That's a high point. There's nothing to be ashamed about. Yeah. Totally. I don't want to rob anyone of being able to see the summit if I can't do it. Yeah. Totally. So maybe I should just call it? I choose to look at this mountain with all of our obstacles and challenges as opportunities for growth. I was able to overcome and to keep climbing. Even though I didn't summit Mount Hood, I have reached a beautiful milestone in my life. As the summit leader, Taylor abandons her summit attempt in order to accompany Shanita back to the parking lot. She sacrifices herself so that the rest of the team can continue with all three guides. As they're rolling me up to the cardiac floor, I couldn't decide what was actually worse. Having a heart attack or actually being transgender in that hospital. The heart surgeon comes in and this tell me, well, we found this blockage. We can't put a stint in and so we're going to have to do two bypasses in your surgery. And my friend Elizabeth asks the doctor a question. Like, well, what is Stacey's diet should be after she gets out of the hospital? And he said, well, he'll be able to do this, and he'll be able to do that, and he'll be able to eat this. And I'm looking around thinking who is this person talking to? I mean, my coworker Justin was there. And I thought, well, why is he talking about Justin? I don't understand. And so one of my other co-workers that was there said, wait. It's she, not he. And he goes yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He'll be able to do this. He'll be able to do that. Starting right back in it, again. I was trying to debate whether to start yelling and cussing him out and weighing that against the fact that I might have another heart attack. Because they we're desperately trying to keep me from having another... They were pumping me full of some kind of stuff that was supposed to keep me from having another heart attack. I was so angry. And I finally said stop. I says you know you're messing up. Right? I says, why do you keep saying this? And he got so flustered and said, well, maybe I'm not the surgeon for you. And turned around and walked out of the room. I sat there for a minute thinking no. This... Anybody that acts the way this doctor does has something against a trans person. Because he didn't even attempt to try to honor who I was. People may think that having the right pronoun use maybe is not that big of a deal. But I'll tell you what, if you're a transgender person, if you're not using the pronoun that they use themselves, you're not respecting that person. You're not honoring that person. All I could think of was going into this surgery with knowing that this guy was operating on me. And the fact that he thought about me in the way that he did. I told my friends, I said listen, I'm not afraid to die. But I'm not going to die at his hands, I'll tell you right now. I had moved to Phoenix with my parents when I was about 18. And about 20 when I came out of the closet. Screaming out of the closet. Flinging those doors to the side. Just saying I was gay didn't make everything easy. It was all these layers of judgments that I kind of had to sift through. I slipped into a real deep depression. I tried to self-medicate and tried to numb the confusion. I started to emotionally eat. And I was up to, like, a pack and a half of cigarettes a day and a six-pack of beer at least every night. I was about 150 and I gained about 60 pounds. So my top weight was 212. And I was, 5' 9. Little guy. I just realized I wasn't happy and I needed to make a change. On more than one occasion, I have received some discrimination within the LGBT community. I think people have a vision that all of the letters alphabet get along so great together. Well, that's not so true. I think the only form of discrimination that I've experienced is the idea of not being queer enough. So not being visible enough. If I'm dating a man at that time, then, all of a sudden, I'm seen as heterosexual. And that can discount my queerness. I have some friends who refer to themselves as lesbians and they have judgment around women that are bisexual. Groups within our community, like, we joke about each other. Like, why would you be friends with a lesbian? You know? We're gay men. There's a pretty radical part of the lesbian community that really thinks trans women are still actually just men. And that we're invading their space. At the root of it all, it's just like a lack of understanding. I mean, trans folks, it's identity-- gender identity. The rest of the alphabet's, pretty much, sexual orientation. So there's some friction there about that at times. Someone that presents as feminine, that identifies as female can pass as straight really easily and therefore is not recognized by the queer community. And that's a form of invisibility. And that's a form of, like, minor oppression. Dating at 212 pounds was tough. Guys wouldn't take a second look at me. Right now, I would say that I dress more androgynously. But I still think I'm a femme person, in general. But knowing that there was a word and that there was other people that felt femme invisibility was really validating for me. Because really, we're just like anybody else. I mean, we have the same hopes and fears and want love and closeness. People just don't know us. It's a bird. It's a plane. It's Taylor going up Mount Hood. Defying the odds, Taylor rejoins the group on the mountain after escorting Shanita to the parking lot. Cannot maintain conversation. Man, the alpenglow on this mountain is just so, so epic. But while I was hiking up, I was looking for the lights as a little beacon for my progress slowly getting closer. And I saw this huge shooting star just cross the entirety of Mount Hood. It was very, very special. All right. The woods are where I love to be. I feel at home there. Nature is where we're all equal. Because nature just doesn't care. I grew up in the woods. That's where I would take my dog when I was a kid. Just to get away from the fray and the craziness. Being in nature actually is my church. Where I find my peace and my centeredness. When you go into wilderness areas and you're connecting with that energy that's there, I know one thing. It fills my soul pretty deeply. It also grounds me incredibly well. I can have been crazy at work for weeks and then go into a place like wilderness and within a day, feel all of that released. And it's all gone. And you're back to square one, again, hopefully. True leadership must provide for the next decade and not merely the next day. And that is the kind of leadership that this Congress must provide. The Wilderness Act was put in place in 1964. It states-- An act to establish a national-- preservation system-- For the permanent good-- Of the whole people-- And for other purposes. I really like that term-- whole people. That there was this grand vision with this Wilderness Act, especially at that particular time in the US history. The Civil Rights Act was coming on after that. Feels almost like a noble thing, in a way. The fact that these pockets of amazing wilderness were for everybody. It's for all of us. For everyone. Not a select few. But actually, everybody. Regardless of race, gender, sexuality. Whether they're immigrants. Whether they're Indigenous people. It's for everybody. I don't know how hard that is to get, but people, it's for everybody. The fact is that there was the foresight to see that these areas should be protected. I like to think of it like for the trauma that you take into those areas that nature's kind of a salve for that. Given that the team is now three hours behind, they can barely take a minute to enjoy the sunrise. In order to prepare for the icy portion of the summit, they quickly put on crampons and proactively wear climbing harnesses. Yeah. Isn't it amazing look down and see Mt. Jefferson. Yeah. It's beautiful. It's just stunning. The climb up Mount Hood is similar to the difficult journey of coming out and becoming your true self. When you think about, I mean, really how do you really change genders? I mean, it just seems so overwhelming to me in such a deep way. And it was so scary to me, as well. Because you're turning your life upside down and inside out. I had a big bushy black beard. Had a great corporate job where I traveled all the time. I was in sales. I would dress as my female self every so often. But the other 99% of my life was as my male self. And just not satisfying and just not really-- it was just so depressing and just so overwhelmingly-- such a burden. I don't think I can stress hard enough really, how much of a burden it was to carry this dual life. One evening I was sitting in my house back in North Carolina. It was in the winter time. I could remember just feeling like the walls in my house were just closing around me. That I really ... suffocating because of what I was carrying with me. I can remember walking outside. And it was a typical North Carolina mountain winter night when those stars were just so clear and it was so crisp. Standing there looking up at the stars and just saying, you know? I really only got two choices here. I says, I can either somehow, in my wildest dreams, try to figure out how to move forward with this transition and to become who I knew that I was. Or that I could just kill myself. And I'm here to tell you that that second option sounded really amazing. It was the wave of peace that washed over me as I thought about just ending it. And that I wouldn't have to think about this problem anymore. And that I wouldn't have to deal with it. I wouldn't have to carry all this confusion and all this just, horrific burden. My god. That felt so good. It felt so good. I just thought, my god. Peace at last? That would be-- I'd had no peace since five years old. And at that time, when this happened, I was in my 30s. So it'd been all this time, I had not had any kind of peace. But even... you drop you heel... I postponed transitioning for a lot of years because I didn't want to lose my daughter, Natalie. Her mom and I, we divorced. Natalie was three years old. I could sense that if I went ahead and pushed where I needed to go that I would actually lose contact with Natalie because of just, the situations around my divorce. And in the anger that was there. And I deeply knew that I couldn't let that happen. And all these years later, I look back and know why I did that. Many years later, I was getting ready to start hormones. And I reached out to her mom to say, hey-- Natalie was probably 15, 16, I guess, at that time. I reached out to her mom to say, hey. I'm getting ready to start hormones. I'm going to transition. And we... I need to tell Natalie. And she said-- she says, well, Natalie already knows. And I go, really? I said, did you tell her? And she goes no. She said it was really funny. She said she was actually watching Oprah one day and there were a group of trans women who were on her show telling their stories. And her mom said that halfway through the Oprah show that my daughter turned around to her mom and says that's exactly what my dad's dealing with. I had never shared that with her. And so she knew. And since that amazing day, she has never once rejected me because I was trans. She's-- which is-- that's not the typical story. The team starts to separate, again. Leaving a large gap between them. Some of the group members are starting to feel the effects of physical and mental exhaustion. Which is then exacerbated by altitude sickness. How do you feel right now? Drunk. Nice. In a good safe way. In a good safe way. Yeah. I see the next flat place. Ready to get there. As they ascend, they see that most of the other teams climbing the mountain have already begun their descent. Having summited the mountain hours before. The summit is still in question. Anybody else just feeling like 10K is high enough? Pretty high. I'm feeling cold and strong. Feel good to continue. My fingies and toes are cold. But when we're moving, I'm like, I'm mobile. So I feel strong. Well, using the one to ten, I think physically, I'm probably about a five. As long as I can stop and, kind of, for five seconds and keep going. I guess, my question would be, is that enough to get to the summit, though? Being at a five. I think, mentally, I'm in a pretty good place. But it's just the physical part. Right. I'm feeling really good. Better than I've felt in long time so let's do it. Nice. Yeah. This is good. This is my happy place. Every time I've climbed a mountain, it's not the summit that I remember. It's the process of getting up there. And you've done that. After a long deliberation period, Stacey decides to abandon the summit. One, two, three. Who's on top? Yeah. It's so cold. ...the encouragement and the support. You, too. Thank you. Who's on top? It's more of a soul thing. We've done on this journey together. The fact that I have gotten at least to the highest place I could get to soul-wise, gave it my all and I gave it my best-- yeah. I think I'm on top. Yeah. Even three and a half hours behind schedule, the cold alpine air holds the snow and ice firm. And allows the team to continue their ascent with less risk. Most of the injuries on Mount Hood occur on the Hogsback. The ridge becomes very steep. And the run out on either side lead to sulfuric sinkholes called fumaroles, which make rescue difficult. In addition, the volcanic gases are the strongest here and stink of rotten eggs. It's a little dangerous because Mount St. Helens erupted in 1984. And Mount Hood is supposed to be the next one that erupts. Right? So there's a little bit of comfort and fear. When I see Mount Hood, I always get really excited. Mostly when it's covered in snow. Because that means that it's climbable. And I just love the way that it looks. It looks like a children's drawing of a mountain. It's pointy. And it has snow. It's got glaciers. And it's got rocks peeking out. And it just looks like such a quintessential mountain. More than, I think, any of the other Cascades. Mount Hood is like that person that you see every day that you've never stopped to meet. And climbing it was a way to actually go and meet Mount Hood. ...like this. Getting to the Pearly Gates, this takes a lot of patience, a lot of time, a lot of strength. And you have to do it. There's no choice. There's no elevator. At three and a half hours behind schedule, the last and most difficult portion of the climb lies ahead for the exhausted team. Nature, in its complexity, creates these special just, outstandingly beautiful ice. It looks like something you get in the sea. A pearl wall. It's awesome. I didn't know what the struggle would be on the climb. I didn't know if I would have the energy to complete it. That's just like coming out. When you start at the bottom of the mountain or you start at the bottom of trying to figure out who you are, goodness. It seems like you are summiting the world's tallest mountain. Who's on top? Well, there is a definite connotation there. And I don't think we're asking about that. Heck yeah. We did it. Geoffrey Chaucer's better late than never idiom has never been more applicable. At four and a half hours behind schedule, the team makes it to the top. My god. What just happened? I think we climbed the mountain. I think who's on top isn't about the summit. Who's on top is about your personal summit. OK. First impressions. Tell us. It's amazing. Tell us what you see. Tell the people what you see. I see beautiful Oregon. The most beautiful state in the country. Who's on top means being the best person you can be. I think everybody has that option. And I encourage everybody to go through that journey. I don't think you can always be at the top of the mountain. Because we still have work to do on ourselves. I'm, very much, on top of the journey that I've gone through to be in a space where I'm at my personal best. LGBTQ people have had to climb some pretty hard and big mountains to become who you are, but that doesn't stop the mountains. They're still there. You like to think they're not as big as they used to be. Certainly, the process of climbing mountains is really similar to the process of coming out and staying out. I mean, the climb itself is an enormous metaphor. Because the first third to a half of the climb, you're in the dark. It's kind of scary. You don't know what you're doing. Are you queer? Are you not? And then once you get up higher, maybe you start to come into yourself. You get, maybe, you're starting to come out or you're starting to admit it to yourself or to your loved ones. And then the sun starts to rise. And you just see everything that is available in front of you. And you see that the summit is so close. And that this process has all been worth it. I've always wanted to have something like this that I connect with and that you can just be at peace. It's kind of awesome. We can do our best in trying to change the world into acceptance, but we can't do that on our own. We have to have help. When we're not there to defend ourselves, or even when we are, it's great if an ally is there to cut out the homophobic comments. Especially when it comes to conversations around the LGBT community. As trans folks, we're always advocating for ourselves constantly. I encourage allies to show up with kindness. I have an uncle that voted for Trump and lives in Kansas. And my Trump-voting uncle texted me and said, I'm so proud of who you are. And I'm so proud of what you're doing. And best of luck to all of you and your friends on the climb. And I love you so much. And I just started weeping as soon as he said that and I got that text from him. Because I really never expected that. Is there hope for us? Yeah. I think that my uncle texting me that showed a lot of hope. Even if it's one person at a time, that's kind of all the change that we can do. This is for all the folks that went down early. All the people that haven't been able to come up here, yet. All the people that haven't been able to share their stories like we have. This is for you. We love y'all.
