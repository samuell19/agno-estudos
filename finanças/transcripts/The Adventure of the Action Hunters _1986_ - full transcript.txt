[ENGINE STARTS] [VOICES SHOUTING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] [MUSIC ON RADIO] [TELEPHONE RINGING] [PHONE HANGING UP] [DIALING ROTARY] [PHONE RINGING] OPERATOR (ON PHONE): 4-1-7-7. Grace, precious, you just missed one of my calls. Now, let's say for the sake of argument-- OPERATOR (ON PHONE): I'm trying to get out of here. For Christ's sake, it's Friday night. It's after 9 o'clock. Well, so it is. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Are you dragging your ass in? Yeah. I, uh-- I had a few things to clear up at the office. MAN (ON PHONE): Uh, they just can't can you.

How are you and the kids? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Oh, I don't need you to call them, Mr. Hotshot Art Director. The children are another thing. CHILD (ON PHONE): (SCREAMING) Daddy! WOMAN (ON PHONE): You don't care one single bit about these children. You never have. You didn't love them from the-- watch it, buster! You know. Sometimes, I think you don't hear a single word I say. You're either in a bathroom or your nose is stuck in a book. Let me tell you one thing-- [THUNDER] [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [BURP] Here are the winning ponies today. Lucky Draw paying nearly twenty to one closed at the rush to beat the gallant filly Gallalet by a head. [INAUDIBLE] but finished no better than third. Lucky Draw has a track record of one minute 55 seconds. [SCREAM] [BOAT ENGINE CLUNKING] [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [ANCHOR SPLASHING] MAN: Oliver Twist. Oliver Twist. [TAPPING] Ah. Walter, that is a hell of a martini. You are a very gifted man. You're right on time. You have something for me? You like martinis? Oh yeah. Of course. Um. What about the money? It's on me. Have a seat. Have a seat. Kind of a crowded tonight. I read you. Loud and clear. I'll be in touch. Ciao. Look. I got to be going. I want you to keep an eye on him for me until tomorrow night. I thought you didn't want me out here by myself. Bets, this is a half million bucks. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] What the hell is this? We had a meeting at 10. I don't like to be kept waiting. Where's the money? [ACCORDION HUMS] The money's here someplace. I know it's here. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] GANGSTER: I can't see what I'm doing down here. Did you ever see one of these babies blow? As soon as that jerk starts this thing, sayonara. BOSS: Just make sure it looks like an accident. [BOAT ENGINE STARTING] [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Jeez. I can't believe it. Can you tell me what it is with the music these days. Where's the melody? What happened to the beautiful lyrics? What happened to your boat? WALTER: Can you help me here, kid? Elizabeth. A little while ago, oh, about 45 minutes ago, some unexpected company dropped by. Two Hollywood gangsters. Actually, the clothes weren't exactly right. But the little one was close. A pinstripe suit. Bulge under his left arm. But gangsters wear big hats with the brim turned down. And the tie-- the tie was all wrong. He was wearing this skinny little nondescript thing. Now, gangsters wear big wide colorful ties, you know. Flowers, that sort of thing. Italians. And anyway, I was having a little drink before dinner, learning some new dance steps. You like martinis? Have a seat. I'll be right back. Don't worry about the upholstery. I hope you like them nice and dry. Up or on the rocks? Straight up. Excellent choice. Olive or twist? An olive would be fine. Mm. Oh thanks. So. What happened? Oh gee, kid. These have gotten warm. Oh, it's OK. WALTER: So they pull up alongside. And the bald one, the brain, tells me we had a meeting at 10 o'clock. He has a gun and everything and that he's here for the money. The what? WALTER: The money. Guess how much? $500,000. Good guess. That's what they were looking for. Half a million dollars in a small watertight box under the floorboards in the [INAUDIBLE]. Now, who in their right mind would hide half a million dollars in an obvious place like that? Last night, I sailed down to Turtle Creek. It's about 20 miles down the Bay. That'd be the first place anyone would look. There was a huge explosion, a big power cruiser blew up. WALTER: I'd hollow out the insides of a book-- This horrible burned-up old man dragged himself ashore. WALTER: They didn't look inside one of these. Are you listening to me? He died. But he said something first. What? Help me. I'm dying. My powerbell blew up. What? I'm trying to guess what he said. You're not even close. Well, how should I know what he said? He said Oliver Twist. Oliver Twist. -Oliver Twist? -Wait a minute. Oliver Twist. Oliver Twist. Oliver Twist. Oyster Creek. Ticknick point. 10 o'clock tomorrow night. That's tonight. Then, he said, $500,000. 500 grand. Well? Oliver Twist. Oyster creek. Ticknick Point. 10 o'clock tonight. That's you, pop. No, kiddo. I can't argue with you there. That's me all right. But I just dropped in here for a quiet night on my way down the Bay. Now, they were expecting someone else. And now, we know who it was and why he didn't show up? BETSY: And how do we know-- Because he told you so himself. BETSY: Look, mister, I don't-- When you talked to him last night. Don't you get it, kid. The old man who died. He was Oliver Twist, not Olive or Twist of course. And he was the one who had the appointment with the gangsters here tonight. And he was the one who was bringing money. Hand me those pants, will you? Skipper. What a jerk. Oh, kid. Half a million bucks in cash. I hope it's in cash. Sitting at the bottom of Turtle Creek. Let's get rolling. We can be down there before morning. Then, as soon as it's light, we take a little dip and waltz away with half a million bucks. What do you say, kiddo? We'll split it 50/50. Hm. Duck soup. -Those guys would kill us. -No. No. They think the old man who died ran off with their money. That money burned up with the boat. Uh-uh, kiddo. Metal box. By the way, my name is Elizabeth, old timer. I haven't been a kid for years. Anyway, they'd follow us. You think they'd let this old tub out of their sight. Uh-uh, kiddo. That's where we fool them. We take your boat. I don't get the old Oliver Twist out much at night. Tease that sheet. Will you? Huh? These things always tip this way? Hm. With a good breeze, which we'll be getting soon. Should put the rail under. Under water? That's right. It's fun. Oh yeah, sure. Well, business before pleasure. You have a map around here? You mean a chart? I think I saw another bottle of this wine downstairs. Yeah, a chart. Is this New York State wine by the way? While you're at it, see if this X marks a flashing light four seconds. Very good. 15 minute shifts. While one of us dives, the other one rests. That way we can go on all day if necessary. But the key to the whole thing is before we get in the water, we divide the creek up into quadrants. Why, Turtle Creek is no more than a speck on the map. Huh. Duck soup. You know roughly where she went down right. Roughly. But what about that mark? WALTER: What was that again? Flashing light four seconds. What's all this meat tenderizer for? BETSY: Sea nettle stings. Why would I think it'd be for meat? BETSY: What about that mark? Flashing light four seconds. This says flashing 14 seconds. F-1-4. Not F-1-4. F-L-4. Now, find me a heading to-- What a gal. --to the quick flashing light at the mouth of the river. [BELL RINGING] WALTER: So you grew up around the water, huh? ELIZABETH: Been here all my life. WALTER: Water brat. ELIZABETH: Except for college. Oh yeah. What they'd teach you in college? ELIZABETH: Art. WALTER: No kidding. ELIZABETH: Fashion design. WALTER: I'm kind of an artist myself. Art director for an advertising agency. That is uh-- ELIZABETH: I'm going to study in Paris at the end of the summer. WALTER: Paris. I love Paris. ELIZABETH: I do all my own clothes. WALTER: Sailed over on "The France." Fra ELIZABETH: This is one of mine. WALTER: France is known for its exquisite cuisine. Every morning, I had the same thing. Croissants and a cheese omelette with home fries. ELIZABETH: See all these panels. WALTER: French home fries of course. ELIZABETH: Don't you think they give it a nice shape? WALTER: And I had bananas in milk, and coffee and juice with the bananas in milk, and a little side order of French toast with some fresh fruit. ELIZABETH: What do you think of the back? I think I like the back a lot. [WIND HOWLING] [THUNDER] [RADIO CHATTER] WALTER: Oh, kid. It's going to be a sensational day. ELIZABETH: Go back to sleep. I'm sorry. It was my pleasure. Engaged? So what does he have that I don't have? Money, Walter. Lots of it. It's my 15 minutes. I tell you, kid. I was just resting my eyes. I don't just fall asleep in the middle of the day. Well, should we get back to it? Duck soup. [INAUDIBLE] Well? Well, kid. Can you believe it? Looks, brains-- Walter. And now-- Money? Lots of it. [SQUEALING] And to the loudest talker. And $100 this time to the best navigator in quadrants. $100 to the woman-- I don't know about that. --with the curliest hair. No. That's not to you. That's to me. And $100 for the best filled out bathing suit. That's also to me. That's mine. Oh. Duck soup. A quarter of a million each. To the penny. Here's what we do. Get into town before the bars close. There's a nice little place up there. What's the name? The Lame Duck. ELIZABETH: That's the name of the place? You've never been-- are you serious? I thought you lived here. -I've got to be getting back. WALTER: Getting back? ELIZABETH: Walter, I really do. WALTER: Absolute nonsense. ELIZABETH: What if they followed us? WALTER: Follow us? Why would they? Kid, I keep going over this. They know I don't have the money. And they think the guy who died ran off with it. And they know absolutely nothing about you. SKIPPER: Anybody, uh, aboard? WALTER: If I were a woman, I wouldn't be caught dead in one of those things. ELIZABETH: What are you saying? It's the latest thing. They're very fashionable. Just cover up. Well, it looks more like a tent. Jeez. I can't believe it. What happened to the pretty dresses and little frilly things? Tents and pants. Oh, and that's another thing. You don't wear pants. Do you, kid? I'm sorry, sir. But none of our choice rooms are available. I'm afraid even our smaller rooms are $25 a piece. WALTER: How late are you serving dinner? CONCIERGE: Until 9 o'clock, sir. But I'm afraid that jacket and tie are absolutely essential. And I rather regret to say that short pants-- excuse me. Excuse me. Mr. Bottenfeld, good afternoon. And how are the greens are today? -Fast. -Oh, good. Good my ass. And the pin position in the 14th is impossible. [NERVOUS CHUCKLE] -Will you break that for me? -Oh, certainly, Mr. Bottenfeld. Certainly. Off our game today. Oh, $50. Uh. Mr. Bottenfeld, the cashier is right over there. Damn nuisance. Three tens and a twenty. Oh, yes. Play golf? Polo. BOTTENFELD: Thank you. WALTER: Any time. Well, I'm-- I'm sorry you can't help us. We'll just have to spend the night aboard. Have Bonito slice up some of that duckling. [CLEARS THROAT] It's delicious. CONCIERGE: Just a moment. The commodore suite might be available. The single rooms will be perfect. No baggage. Just these boxes. Thanks so much. Oh, it's a very nice suit. Is that worsted wool? Yes. Yes, it is. Very nice. [BELL DINGS] Cocktails, my dear. Why not the honeymoon suite? Walter, I said drinks and dinner. We have to get cleaned up and dressed. What are we going in here for? I said drinks and dinner, and I mean it. Now, that is final. [BOAT ENGINE RUMBLING] GANGSTER: 14 seconds, I tell you. 14 seconds it says. BOSS: There's no such thing as a flashing 14 seconds. 1-4. Now, what does that mean. BOSS: Ignoramus. GANGSTER: You know what I'll do with it. Don't you? BOSS: No, stupid. I told you. There's no such thing as 14 seconds-- Oh, Christ. Don't look now, but here comes a little-- don't look. You'll blow it for me. [INAUDIBLE] She can't be with that guy. He's her uncle. [LAUGHING] I would like a very dry [INAUDIBLE] martini straight up with an olive. Very, very dry. And um-- I'll have Coke high. Coke high? Bourbon and Coca Cola. [LAUGHING] He's her uncle. He's her uncle. How many beers have you had? If I got any calls from the coast, barkeep, can you please hold them? [BABBLING] PATRON: Turn around please. They're for everybody. Is she watching me now? Pipe down. You're making a fool of me. Your cigar-- -Ugh. My god. What do you call that? You call that dry? Ugh. Why don't you ditch the old man and go for a ride in my car? CONCIERGE: Franz, you absolute idiot. What are you doing to disturb our guests? She's crazy about me. Tall blonde, huh. Cute. Nope. We haven't seen them. A guy with a mustache. They to come by this way. It's the only road. ED: Don't know how we could have missed them. Can't go far. The last ferry takes off at 6:00. 5:00, Har. No. It's 6:00 in the summer, Ed. I know. They're up at the inn, The Lame Duck up at the end of the road. Now, they could take the train, but that's not until 9:20. No. It's 10:20 in the summer, Ed. Bartenders. What would a man who mixes bourbon with a Coca Cola know about martinis? Olive or twist? [DRUNKEN LAUGHING] These slivers. Where's your knife? I'm going to show you how to twist a lemon peel. (SINGING) He had room for his ass and a gallon of gas. His balls hung and he lost them. [SINGING IN DISTANCE] Be right with you, kiddo. I'm late. Louis, the manager, he's very excited about my martini. He couldn't stop talking about it. We were trying to think of a name for it. You know, something with a little class. BOSS: Well, well, look what I found. Get your hands off that. GANGSTER: I thought you said he didn't have it. Give me the box, you ignoramus. Give me that box. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Son of a bitch. (WHISPERING) Kid. GROUP: Surprise! Saul, you look terrible. I wouldn't recognize you. This must be Sam. Get in. My, how you've grown. Kid, your hair. I love it off to the side like that. I thought, uh, jacket and tie were required for dinner. Your forehead is a little short for the style, but it looks nice, very nice. [SINGING IN THE DISTANCE] I have to have these back tomorrow morning, 9 o'clock. [CHATTER] [SHUSHING] GROUP: Surprise. This is very comfortable. Is-- is this the way it's worn? What do we do? Huh. Uh, we really got to get out of here. How? Walk. You can't go anywhere looking like that. [LAUGHING] Can you believe it? The gals are here. She's crazy about me. [LAUGHING AND BABBLING] DRUNK: She's not as bad as the last one. I want to introduce my buddy to this big hunk of woman over here. Not a bad fit. At least, it's very comfortable. Come on. Do you think the sleeves are maybe a skosh long? Oh. Isn't this nice? Pst. Mademoiselle. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Give me a hand with this tie. Will you, kid? Too bad we're on the run. This is really a very interesting town. I think the thing I like most about it is the complete absence of stimulating cultural activity, no picture galleries, no museums. Oh, Christ! Stop the car. Stop the car. You? -Well, hello there. -Skip. -Bets. -Skipper. WALTER: You two know each other. The two guys in the black boat. They're hoods, killers. They know all about last night. I mean Friday night. The money and all. They're here in town. WALTER: How did they find out about the money? SKIPPER: I told them. I had to, Betsy Lou. They were going to kill me. Skipper. They sunk the boat. WALTER: They sunk which boat? Whisper. (EXASPERATED) Skipper. This is insane. Skipper's right. They'll kill us. So that's how they figured it out. Damn. I forgot all about him. [WHISTLING] WALTER: Ooh. ELIZABETH: What? WALTER: It's them. ELIZABETH: Oh, I knew. Oh god. I told you. WALTER: The Esmo brothers. Listen. Listen to this. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] WALTER: It's a real unique group. It's a unique sound. It was one of-- ELIZABETH: That's enough, Walter. Shut up. WALTER: What? [TRAIN WHISTLING] Every night, I had Welsh rib. You know what that is. We got to get rid of this thing. I'm too wealthy to be in a stolen car. The train. It goes right through Beulah. They have a dining car? Come on. We have just enough time to catch the train. Hurry. Come on. Hurry. MAN (ON LOUDSPEAKER): This will be the final call for track number one. Final call for track number one. All aboard. [MUSIC PLAYING] And two, no three bottles of beer. Nice and cold. Thank you. ELIZABETH: Walter. What happened to you? Turn out that light. CONDUCTOR: Aboard. Well, kid. That was a touch close, but I think we really lost them this time. We'll be back in Beulah before they even know we're gone. And as soon as we get back to the old Oliver Twist, we'll make us up a nice batch of martinis. Just like old times. Of course, there are a few complications. You idiot. They'll kill us. No. No. No. No. I'm very serious. I know you're serious. It's all wrong. Batch of martinis. You're crazy. Completely crazy. [CRYING] I hate martinis. Kid. You seem so much older. You look much younger. [KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] WALTER: Just a moment. Is everything all right, sir? Everything's just right. [KNOCK] -Walter? Be right back. Where did you go? Porter forgot the bottle opener. I must be dreaming. You scared me half to death. Pinch me. ELIZABETH: Bless us, O Lord, for this meal which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen. ELIZABETH: And deliver us from evil. Amen. Walter? You think they followed us? Ah, this looks scrumptious. Roast beef? Do you? WALTER: Asparagus. What if they saw us going down the fire escape? Uh-uh. They didn't. What if they found those fellas? They could be right behind us. They could be on the train now. What is that? Hollandaise sauce. Trust me. They were nowhere to be seen when we drove off. Gravy? ELIZABETH: Are you sure? Sure. I'm sure. It's brown. It's lumpy. [LAUGHING] Hey. Did you see who drove off in that Gala convertible? No. Yeah. [LAUGHING] Which way's the train station? You know who's tie that is? It's mine. Come on. Why don't you two dumb shits get some clothes on? [THUNDER] (LAUGHING) Dumb shits. Hey. Did you see that bird in there with the pink dress on? What a set of knockers. Yo. Hey. Hey, stop. Huh. Hey. [HORN HONKING] Hey. Stop the car! Jeez. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] GANGSTER: (SINGING) Said Uncle Joe to the big black-- hey. What the hell do you think you're doing? [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECH] Son of a-- [BAND PLAYING MUSIC] Aboard. [TRAIN HONKING] Well, kid, that was a touch close, but I think we really lost them this time. Tickets please. Have your tickets ready please. Tickets please. Tickets please. Tickets please. Wait a minute. Four beers please. Nice and cold. [TRAIN WHISTLING] [KNOCKING] [KNOCK] Be right back. ELIZABETH: Walter? [TAP] [CLATTER] Walter? [SQUEAK] [WHIMPERS] What are you doing in there, kid? Dinner's getting cold. [SIGH] You OK? WALTER: Pinch me. Bless us, O God, for this meal which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord. WALTER: Amen. And deliver us from evil. Walter, do you think they followed us? Oh. This looks scrumptious. ELIZABETH: Do you? WALTER: Asparagus? ELIZABETH: What if they saw us going down the fire escape? WALTER: Uh-uh. They didn't. ELIZABETH: What if they found those two fellas? WALTER: Trust me. They were nowhere to be seen when we drove off. Gravy? ELIZABETH: Are you sure? Sure I'm sure. It's brown. It's lumpy. Walter. Can't you ever be serious? What can be more serious than gravy? You're never serious. Kid, will you relax and enjoy dinner? When you were gone, I heard a lot of strange noises. Uh, kid, you're imagining things. Strange noises in here? You want me to check out the room? If I listen to you, I'd think they were hiding in our compartment ready to leap out at any moment. Kid, relax and enjoy dinner. Oh. This is dreamy. [SCREAMING] PASSENGER: [INAUDIBLE]. She got fired too. [LAUGHING] [DINGING] MAN (ON LOUDSPEAKER): Now arriving at Coastal Limited. This will be the final call for boarding. What's taking you so goddamn long? This is as far as we go. Walter, he's got a gun. [GUNSHOT] [TRAIN WHISTLING] [COUGHS] [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] [SIRENS BLARING] MAN (ON RADIO): Medic one. Medic one, acknowledge. [THUNDER] [SIRENS BLARING] SPOKESPERSON (ON TV): No other cigarette can make that statement. Yes. Doctors know the superiority in Philip Morris. That's why eminent nose and throat specialists actually suggest Philip Morris in cases of irritation due to smoking. Next time you buy-- DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): Attention all units. Be on the lookout for the following subject traveling across country and heading in an easterly direction. Wanted as a suspect in a homicide on the Coastal Limited approximately one half hour ago. Widely varying descriptions indicate the suspect to be white, male, 24 to 50, average height, 150 to 200 pounds, bald, wearing coke-bottled eyeglasses. Suspect is armed and considered extremely dangerous. Listen. Let me see that rock on your finger for a minute. The ring. Now, watch this very closely. [THUNDER] [GLASS BREAKING] Viola.

[THUNDER] I'm sure we lost them. Just don't say that. Where do you think you're going? [COUGHING] Goddamn kids. Will you get the hell home! Let's go. Do you have a girlfriend? Yeah. And a wife. A couple of kids. Here. I saw something moving. [RADIO CHATTER] MAN: Over here, Dilly. [THUNDER] Here I saw something moving. Over here, Dilly! Over this way, Dilly. Who the hell are you? Oh, uh, my-- my boat is anchored right over there. Betsy Lou? Percival? PERCIVAL: You look different. Older. I mean that is good. Hey, hey, but you better get back to your boat. There's a maniac out there. He killed two people on the train. He stabbed one, and he shot the other one. Isn't that great? Gotta go. So, uh, kid, where from here? ELIZABETH: Behind the yard is a road that leads right down to the creek. Straight out from the water man's pier. Well, uh, excuse me for saying so, kid. But I think the creek goes down that way. Are you sure we can get to it? ELIZABETH: Walter, I've been here my whole life. I know you're a man, but-- WALTER: That's-- ELIZABETH: I've anchored in this creek every day for the past ten years. WALTER: OK. No, you're right. You're right. That's good. You're right. Still seems to me that the creek goes down that way. [SHOUT] [SCREAM] Take that. [GUNSHOT] WALTER: I can't tell you how impressed I am. You're good. I'm really impressed. OK. Now, this is going to be duck soup. Oh god. Now, wait a minute. Ah, away we go. [BOAT ENGINE SPUTTERS] No. Wait a minute. [BOAT ENGINE SPUTTERS] You got to stop them. They're stealing our boat. You got to stop them, police. You got to stop them. They stealing my boat. WOMAN: Get your skinny ass out there and stop them. No. [SIRENS BLARE] I had an old Evinrude. Started every time. [ENGINE STARTS] [SIREN BLARES] [SCREAM] Where'd he go? Where'd he go? They stole my damn boat. What'd he look like? Male? Where did he go? We got to get out of here. Duck soup, Elizabeth. Duck soup. I-- I got this. Get this thing started up. GANGSTER: Did you ever see one of these babies blow? As soon as that jerk starts this thing, sayonara. WALTER: What did I do with those keys? Try the back bedroom. ELIZABETH: You mean the aft stateroom? WALTER: You don't have to bite my head off. ELIZABETH: Oh god. They're not here. I got them. Sorry about that martini that I promised you, but as soon as-- [CLINKING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] What did he look like? Ready? Not too bad. This isn't always easy. She's a lot like my ex-wife. What do you mean? I can never get her to turn over. For godsakes, Walter, start the damn boat. Will you calm yourself down? This time, we've lost him. Put the box on the floor. Now, turn around. What's he going to do? Well, Elizabeth, I think he's going shoot us. Please stop calling me that. Charlie, bring the damn boat over to the land. BOSS: All right. Start this up and let's get out of here. GANGSTER (VOICEOVER): Ever see one of these babies blow? Wait! Son of a bitch. Follow me. [SPLASH] We really got to get out of here. Give me the box. Do you have the box? No. I distinctly remember you-- What the hell are you doing out here? ELIZABETH: Walter. Betsy Lou? [EXPLOSION] [RADIO CHATTER] I hope that insurance premium was paid up. ELIZABETH: [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, Walter, I just can't. WALTER: Elizabeth. ELIZABETH: As soon as we find the money again, it's over. WALTER: Elizabeth, come on. ELIZABETH: This has been kind of the most fun I ever had. I'll never see you again. I just know it. WALTER: Don't be ridiculous. ELIZABETH: We'll never find it again anyway. WALTER: No, Elizabeth. I know exactly where the old Oliver Twist went down. ELIZABETH: Well, it's not over this way, Walter. And will you please just call me kid? [HICCUP] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Ah. Much better. I think you bruised the gin just a skosh. It's good. Very good. Kid, where's the corsage? Oh, they promised me. I'll call and have them send it down here right now.
