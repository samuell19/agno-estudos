- I want you to look for the words, reveal, pretend, and love in your readers tonight. I want you to be able to spell them on Monday. - [Class] Aww! (soulful music) - Oh, so grumpy! I'll tell you what, if everyone does well on their spellings, we might have a DVD next week. (children cheer happily) (school bell rings) (soft piano music) You okay Ardal? Oh Ardal, that's lovely. - I used a week's pocket money. - Oh, why, that's far too much, you didn't have to. - I did, it's important that you know how I feel about you. - Well this is very special and I'll treasure it always. Does this mean we're engaged? - Well, I hadn't thought about, if you want to, I suppose. - Well, that's very sweet and I'll certainly give it some thought. You have a good weekend, okay? - Yes Miss, I definitely will. (lighthearted music) - So, how was everyone's day? - You're hoarse. - Screaming at some kid with a crossbow. - No! - Yeah. Wee shite was off his head in glue and trying to rob a news agent. Had to go ahead to shooting everything. - Oh, cool, did you waste him? - That's not cool, Ardal. No more cowboy films. - No, he backed down an end tanker, otherwise, I'd be sitting here with an arrow in me head. - Where are these kid's parents? - Mom, what age can a person get married at? - I think it's 16, why? Have you got some news for us? - No, well, not yet. I'll keep you posted. (gentle guitar music) - Come on Ardal! You're dawdling. - Hello Ardal. Bought anything nice? - Boots. - Oh, lovely, they make you look very smart. - They're cowboy boots. - Wow, very cool. I got something special myself. - Hello Ms. Purdy. Oh my goodness, someone's a lucky girl! That's gorgeous! - Thanks Mrs. Travis. This is my, oh, my fiance Pierce, this is Ardal, one of my second classers, and his mom. - [Mrs. Travis] Congratulations. - Yeah, cheers. - Catherine, we done here yet? The match is starting in 10 minutes. - Well I thought we'd get a celebratory lunch. - I think you've pleased me enough today as it is. Come on, I don't wanna miss kickoff. - Okay, bye Ardal, bye Mrs. Travis! - [Mrs. Travis] Bye! (paper crumples loudly) (school bell rings) - Now remember your spellings please! Bye! Bye Ardal! Ardal Travis, come here please. What's up Ardal? - I see you're wearing his ring and not mine? - Oh, it's complicated Ardal, someday you'll-- - How is it complicated? He's not good for you, Miss. - I'm sorry pet, go on. - It's all right, you'll see anyway. - What do you mean? - Nothing, you'll just see that I'm the one that loves you. - Oh Ardal, I know you do, and you're very special to me too. But sometimes grownups, we have-- - I have to go home Miss, bye. I would've taken you for lunch. - What? - I would've missed the football and taken you for lunch. - Come on woman! Always the friggin' last. (loud knocking) Well hello there. What can I do for you? - Don't marry Ms. Purdy. - Come again? - [Ardal] I'm telling you, you're not to marry Ms. Purdy. - And why is that then? - Because she's mine. - Oh, well, that is a dilemma. - Don't laugh at me. - Sorry pal, but you know, all's fair in love and war. See, she told me you were just too short. - [Ardal] She never said that. - Yep, and that you weren't financially stable enough to cater for her needs, she's a high maintenance lady, you know? - I don't know what that means. - You will mate, you will. - You talk stupid. - Now, now, don't be getting-- - Meet me in a draw. - A what? - A draw, just you and me. Right in the Humboldt court. Tomorrow, after school. (giggling) To the death! (laughing) Okay, so, what are we fighting with? Swords, pistols, conkers? - Pistols. - Bye Jove, it's a date sir! - See you there. - And may the best man, or boy, win. (giggling) - What's tickled you? - Oh you gotta hear this. (gentle music) (drums methodically) Come on! Oh, wait. Gotta see this. - What? - [Pierce] I have an appointment with death, remember? - Leave, don't be mean to him. - Come on, I just want to see. You can stay here if you like. (soft, intense music) Was beginning to think you wouldn't show. - Where's your gun? - Think I've forgotten it. Silly me, huh? - That's not my problem. - Suppose not. So then... where's your, gun? (laughs nervously) That's not real. - Yes it is. - What's going... Ardal, what are you doing? - That's not... now don't point! It's not real, it's a toy, isn't it son? - It's not a toy. - Ardal put that down, now. - And where would you get a real-- - My dad's a Garda. - Hang on, guards aren't armed. - The emergency response unit are. - You couldn't have told me about this? Jesus, now, do be careful wee man, just-- - Don't marry teacher. - Just put that thing down and we can talk about-- - Say you won't marry Ms. Purdy, you don't deserve her. - Why, you don't even know me! - I know you're not good enough for her. - Why? - Because you're a dickhead. - Ardal Travis! - Sorry Miss. - Are you just gonna stand there and watch one of your second classers blow my head off? - He won't. - Have you not seen City of God, get a fucking cop or something! - Stay there Miss. - Ardal please, put it down. I'm going to have to put it on your report, what will your mom and dad say? - I told you I'd show you Miss. - Now listen to your teacher, son. - Tell her you won't marry her. - [Pierce] I'm not gonna tell her that. - [Ardal] Tell her! (frightened groans) - Just, just, just hold on there! Don't, okay, okay, you can have her! I never wanted to marry her anyway! - Excuse me? - She moaned constantly about it, she did my head in, I thought putting a ring on her finger would shut her up for awhile! I don't want to be married. Please, please, Ardal, Ardal, please don't shoot me, please. Get someone you stupid bitch! (gun fires) - See Miss? - You dickhead. - You little bastard! - You come anywhere near him and I'll tell everyone that you're a kitty fiddler. Come on Ardal. - Will this go on my report Miss? - Maybe we'll keep this between ourselves, but maybe you should give me that for safekeeping. - Oh, God, that's very realistic, where did you get it? - My dad was hiding it in his wardrobe for my birthday. Nice, isn't it? - It's certainly very pretty. I'll just pop it in here for safekeeping. Oh, what's this? It's all right Miss, I've decided not to marry you after all. - Oh, why's that? - I'm not financially stable enough to care for all your needs. And someone as nice as you should have everything she wants. - Someday some girl's going to be very lucky. - Nah, girls are stupid. - Well we certainly can be. Come on Romeo, I'll get you home.
