(dramatic music) (gong) (dramatic music) (thunder clap) (dramatic music) (chatter) (dramatic music) - [All] Ha, ha, ha! (dramatic music) - [All] Ha, ha, ha! (dramatic music) - Target! (dramatic music) Pair off! (dramatic music) - [Tshingi] The drill is over, get back to your post. - But we still have to. - You heard me Dyala! (thunder clap) - We are facing more than just soldiers. - If you mean Kalungo's magic, I disagree. - The Bayatans have always wanted to enslave us and we have always defeated them when they tried. What difference will King Kalunga's so-called magic make? - It can make all the difference. Thunder may just be the beginning. - If he can do more than raise thunder what can you do to stop him? - Without the sword of Azundati not much. - Azundati and her sword have been gone for 500 years. We don't need magic to win this battle. We could use a little courage though. (dramatic music) Balgur, Balgur, Balgur! Balgur! (dramatic music) Balgur! (dramatic music) - [Man] Look out! (yelling) (yelling) (laughing) (yelling) - [Man] Come over this way! - Can't you stop this? - [Man] We got to get out of here! - Kalunga is too strong. The spirit will stop him. Get the Spirit Stone out of the city. It must not fall into his hands. - Tshingi get the Spirit Stone to Shunar tell the queen what's happening here. The Emerald Land depends on you! - Dyala, take six Amazons to the temple and remove the Spirit Stone, we must get it to Shunar at all costs. - [Dyala] Come with me! (yelling) - [Man] Open the gates. Come on open the gate! (all yelling) - [Man] Take that! - [Man] Coming through! - [Man] Get over here! (yelling) Everybody! Let's go! (yelling) (thunder clapping) (yelling) (soft music) - [Amazon] Look out! - [Soldier] To the temple hurry! Let's go, let's go! - [Amazon] Bayatons! (yelling) (dramatic music) (yelling) - Come on! (dramatic music) - How do we get out of here? The Bayatons are everywhere! - We'll take the south tunnel, let's go! - I give you, Embici! (cheers) Soon all the Emerald Land will belong to us! (cheers) Tonight we celebrate. Take what you want, do as you please! (dramatic music) Atvan prepare the largest house in the city for me. See that the Spirit Stone's brought there. (yelling) (dramatic music) So the Amazons took the Spirit Stone from you just like, that? - Yes Omnipotent Lord, they fought like demons. - Demons? (laughs) I could show you real demons. Well the Spirit Stone doesn't matter, I could of used it against them, but they wouldn't dare use it against me. Still, you failed. Take them to the gates, impale them upside down. We'll let their incompetence rot with their flesh. - As you wish Omnipotent Lord. - Mercy. Omnipotent Lord. - Mercy? Mercy for failure? What a strange notion. There is no mercy for failure. (dramatic music) - Look now each of you into the tree that holds your soul. May the trees that guard our spirits help us to overcome our defeat. And may the Sacred Grove renew our strength for struggle. And show us the sign that will save our Emerald Land. (dramatic music) May the trees of your spirits show to you your soul. Reflections of who you are and who you shall be. (dramatic music) - [Soldier] Move 'em on, move 'em on! Talgor is waiting. Hurry 'em up, get 'em up over there, wench. Come on, come on. This knife doesn't cut enough, move it, move it! Hurry, get over there. (whimpering) (crying) - [Soldier] Everybody get down, get down! (dramatic music) - They're here Balgur! Balgur! - Only eight Kalunga? - [Man] Please, I have a family. - You must do better than this. - I'm keeping my part of the bargain. - Lives for power mortal. You provide the lives, we always provide the power. You want more power for your bolts, give us more lives. Understood? - I understand only too well Balgur. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - The Amazons have reached with the Spirit Stone but Embici is gone. Will we be next? - Not while I'm in command. - Can you defend us against thunder bolts? (gong) (soft music) - Thanks to your courage Kalunga didn't get this Spirit Stone. With it he could've done us even greater harm. My warriors, I must ask more of you than you've already done. When you were in the Sacred Grove what did you see in your trees? - Saw my spirit your Majesty, as always. - That's what I saw, nothing else. - I saw my spirit. - And you Dyala, what did you see? - I saw a sword, glowing with inner fire. - Why didn't you speak of this when you were in the grove? - Tshingi! Dyala your vision demands discussion. You may leave us now warriors. - I knew it was the lost sword, but I didn't see where it was, without that the vision had no meaning. - But it does have meaning child. I saw a hill, in a country beyond the Pagash Forest. A cave was there. And my dream brought me close to its entrance. But I never could see what's inside. - That's where the sword is. - We must recover the sword. It's our only chance to save the kingdom. - I will find the cave and bring back the sword. - That's my command Dyala. May the gods bless your courage. - The people are rising Omnipotent Lord. Two of our spies have been eliminated. One of them was Sebastian, our best. - Who mourns the death of a traitor? Something else Commander Arban? - There's been a disturbing rumor Omnipotent Lord. - Which is? - Well. - Speak. - It is said that there is a sword that can destroy you. - The sword is a dream, nothing more. Let the ambitions have their dream. You and I know better don't we? - Yes, Omnipotent Lord. - Go and prepare your troops. The Emerald Land will soon belong to us. - I will Kalunga. - If the sword is near Pagash country we'll need an army to get it. - We cannot spare an Army. Not after the losses at Embici. - I'll go alone. - You'll go with Tashi, you need someone to guard your back. - You're right Tshingi. But Tashi has to agree to this too. - She will your Majesty. - The cave has to be in the Hidden Hills. To go there you must pass through outlaw country and the Pagash Forest. Remember this, the Weiraways are near the Hidden Hills. - The Weiraways? Demon land. - The place I'll stay away from. - Dyala because you had the vision only you can remove the sword from its resting place. Only you! - I understand. - Then it's settled. Now I will speak alone with Dyala. - Tashi, come I have news for you. - I know it's difficult for you to accept Tashi as a companion, but she's the best in your squadron. And the feud between your families has gone on too long. - Her mother and mine. - Succeed in your mission Dyala and you will become a person with name. Wealth and honor will be yours. - All that matters is we defeat Kalunga. - The spirits were wise to choose you. Now forget the past and work with Tashi to recover the sword. - You want me to do what? - Kill her! I spoke plainly didn't I? (dramatic music) Are you forgetting who did this to me? - Dyala's mother. - I was your age, we fought over a man. He became Dyala's father. Their happiness didn't last too long. - Their death was no accident? - Don't ever say that! You will do as you are told. When Dyala recovers the sword kill her. Then you will bring the sword back to us and you will be the hero. And I will have my vengeance. I raised you as a tool Tashi. An instrument of vengeance. I never loved your father and I never meant to love you, but I do. Are you my daughter or aren't you? - I am your daughter. (somber music) - I hear the Pagash practice human sacrifice. - Mostly with the Porniyani who can't defend themselves. - It's time to ride not talk. Coming? - We'll be back, with the sword. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (soft music) (growling) - Easy my pet. This is a friendly visitor. (soft music) Akam, you've had your breakfast. A nice, plump rebel I believe? (soft music) You must have news, you wouldn't have come here otherwise? - Yes I have news. - Tell me. - The sword of Azundati has been located. It's in the Hidden Hills beyond the Pagash country. Even now two warriors are on a mission to recover it, so it can be used against you. - And what are the chances that they'll recover it? (somber music) - One of the warriors is my daughter. She'll bring the sword to me. I'll see that it never troubles you and we can continue with our plans. (laughter) - Ah Tshingi you will make an excellent Emerald Queen. - I'll do my part, do yours. - She could easily use the sword against me. should I trust her not to? What do you think Akam? (dramatic music) - If she could betray her own people, she could betray you. - I agree. That's why I want the sword in my hands. Follow the two Amazon warriors. Let them find the sword, then kill them. Both, and bring the sword to me. Wait! If you succeed you'll be well rewarded, but if you fail, well, there'll be a new carpet in this chamber. Understand? (soft music) (soft music) (growling) (soft music) - [Man] Hey! - [Tashi] Dyala! (laughter) - [Man] We've got 'em cornered! We've got 'em right now! (grunting) Get 'em down. Come on what are you waiting on? (grunting) Bring her down! (grunting) - Tashi look out! - [Man] She's down. - Before we sell you to the Pagash they won't mind if we use you first. (dramatic music) - Pig! (growling) - What the the hell? What happened? (yelling) (dramatic music) (groaning) - Tashi! She left. - Never know who are friends are do we? - [Soldier] What if Dyala and Tashi don't succeed? - My daughter will not fail. - [Soldier] How long can we wait? - As long as necessary. We can't face Kalunga without the sword of Azundati. - He's only a man. Blade to the heart will put an end to him and his magic. - That blade would never reach him. - [Soldier] A strange notion coming from the general of the Amazons. - That should be obvious, even to you. - I understand your concern Habron but the sword is our greatest hope. As for killing Kalunga, I agree with Tshingi. This is my decision. (dramatic music) - Do you think we can get the horses through all this? (grunting) Dyala! (dramatic music) (grunting) (dramatic music) (coughing) (dramatic music) (grunting) (dramatic music) (groaning) - We must act now. If not we'll all end up in the Weirways. - [Man With Black Hair] Still no word from the capital? - [Woman] Nothing. - We can't rely on Shunar, and Kalunga's taking more of us to the temple every day. We must stop him. - How Timan, with what? - We need knowledge of his weaknesses. - Timagen was supposed to bring us that information. He's late. (dramatic music) (soft chatter) - [Soldier] She would've been, it would've been nice. - [Soldier] Oh well. - [Soldier] You're filled with lies. - [Head Soldier] Let's go! Come on move! - [Soldier] Hurry, come on! - I hear something. - [Soldier] Mister you were right! Get them! (dramatic music) - How much did you pay Timagen? - [Soldier] Take them away! (soft music) - This way. (soft music) - For you of Avasha, for everlasting peace for the Niyatis. - Look down. - The Pagesh. (soft music) (dramatic music) (yelling) (dramatic music) - Help me! (yelling) (dramatic music) (yelling) (dramatic music) - [Man] They're off. Get her! (dramatic music) - [Man] There she is get her. (dramatic music) (yelling) (groaning) (yelling) - [Man] Let's go! - I hope you understand the risks I take coming here. - I understand more than you think. Are you aware of the full extent of my ambition? - You want to conquer my people. (laughing) - Not just your people, all people. I wasn't born with this power. I'm paying a very high price for it and while I have it I intend to use it. I will only let someone stand by my side who is strong like you. - My husband was weak, now he's dead. (dramatic music) - It's a long ride back to Shunar. - Yes. - You think you have me Kalunga? - Yes. - Where is Yulinas? - Hunting. Hunting. (laughs) - No! Let me go. Don't fight! - [Man] Come on, get her! - No! - [Man] Get her, get her inside. - Let me go! Dyala! Get off! - Move, move! Get up. Get up! Help! Help me with this! See it wasn't so hard. (speaking foreign language) What is this (speaking foreign language)? - Death. - [Tashi] No, no, no! No! You're not listening! No! Dyala! No! No! (dramatic music) - [Guard] Where are you going? - [Tshingi] Kalunga's business. - What business is that? - [Tshingi] Why don't you go ask him, I'll wait here. He did tell me to rush. - Go ahead. - Let him go. (dramatic music) You dare to rebel against my benevolent rule? (scoffs) How ungrateful. - One day the Weirways will take you. (dramatic music) - Put him in there. - [Soldier] Should he be impaled tonight Omnipotent Lord? - No, I'm saving him for my lioness. She loves fresh meat. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) - Eat these, and it won't hurt when they do it. (speaking foreign language) (cheers) (speaking foreign language) - [Man] Get it? (laughter) (speaking foreign language) - [Man In Red] Get down! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (yelling) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (yelling) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - No! (yelling) - [Man] I'll cut her free! - [Tashi] No, let me go! (dramatic music) (yelling) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - No dream leaves? Then die in pain! - No! Pagash! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (grunting) (dramatic music) (groaning) (dramatic music) (groaning) (dramatic music) (yelling) (soft music) (dramatic music) (groaning) (dramatic music) - [Tashi] No! (dramatic music) - [Dyala] Come on you're getting out, you're free. - [Tashi] Go, let's go! - [Dyala] No more (speaking foreign language). - [Tashi] Everyone go, out. - [Dyala] That's it. Come on you're free! - [Tashi] Out, come on everyone go. - [Dyala] Let's go. Come on. - The Weirways, how many souls has Kalunga delivered? - More than 100 your Majesty. - What you did was very brave Vishti. - If only I'd killed more of them. - You'll have your chance, with the Amazons. Tshingi see that she's trained as one of them. - Go to the Amazon quarters and rest. - Thank you your Majesty. - [High Priest] This can't go on. - I agree, we must act now. - Your Majesty, I am willing to die to save our people. So are our warriors! If that is your order we attack without the sword. - Tell them, I can no longer prevent you. - There is an alternative to the sword. I can fight Kalunga's bolts with the Spirit Stone. (somber music) To do it I must surrender my soul and transfer it to the Spirit Stone. But it might not work for long. - When I was in that cage I didn't think you'd come back. And it wasn't just because of the sword. - Why then? - We've never been the best of friends. - That's changed now hasn't it? Your mother and mine quarreled. Tshingi lost her hand, my mother lost her life. That's in the past, what does that got to do with us now? - The past still lives. (dramatic music) - Really Tashi? (dramatic music) (growling) - I'll take the first watch. - Traitor! Traitor, traitor! - It was a long ride Kalunga, why did you summon me? - What is your current troop strength? How soon will the queen march on me? What news have you of the sword? - I rode all night for that? Information any second rate spy could have given you! (dramatic music) - I use first rate spies, I plan thoroughly, I do not leave loose ends! You, you don't see beyond that hand of yours do you? I offer you ultimate power and you complain about a ride from Shunar. - Ultimate power? - Yes. With the sword of Azundati in my hands I can conquer even the Weirways. - My daughter is bringing the sword to me! Remember? - Forget your silly daughter. My lioness has gone hunting to bring the sword to me. I told you I never leave loose ends. (dramatic music) Are you strong enough to stand by my side no matter what? - Yes. - Very well. Then what is your current troop strength? When will the queen march against me? What news have you of the sword? - The Hidden Hills must be a long way off. - In that direction. I wish we had our horses. (soft music) (neighing) What do you see, trouble? - I can't tell yet, but there's something. (neighing) You said you wanted a horse. (soft music) (neighing) Hey! I think he wants to follow him. - Come on, we don't have time for this. - No, wait, lead on. - At least he could give us a ride. (dramatic music) (neighing) (soft music) - Welcome, I'm glad you're here. - He did not give us much choice. - Henar knows who I need to see. Two warriors on a long road, far from home. - We seek the sword of Azundati. - Come and share food with me young warriors. Kalunga, the wizard only the sword can defeat. - How do you know that? Mystery woman. - The sword beckons from the Shining Cave. Three will enter, one will leave. The holder must pay a price. - Three will enter? There are only two of us. There are only two of us. (dramatic music) - Today we begin the liberation of Embici. - [Mean] Embici! (cheers) Kalunga is powerful but we have courage and hope. (cheers) The power of the Spirit Stone is with us. (cheers) - [Dyala] I know where the sword is. - Follow the plane till you reach the hills. Follow the hills to the wound in the earth. - Are you the third person who will enter the cave? - I can't say more. Now go! (dramatic music) - What's wrong? Tell me! - Let's get the sword, that's what we're here for isn't it? (dramatic music) - Shunar, land of the Emerald Queen. (laughs) My land, Balgur's queen. - Your conscience. - My conscience fool, is caged. - You think bars like these are strong enough to cage the conscience of man? - A man or his conscience can be led, crushed, or caged like you. - Then you should kill me now before it's too late. - Oh, I'll kill you. That we shall grant but how and when depend upon my lionesses pleasure. For the moment you amuse me. - You won't be smiling when you reach hell. - Hell? Hell will be my greatest conquest. Then I'll be in heaven. (laughs) (soft music) (dramatic music) - How do we get across? (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (gasps) (dramatic music) (gasping) (dramatic music) - [Dyala] Tashi! (dramatic music) (wind blowing) (growling) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (rock clanking) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (somber music) - You knew? - You wouldn't kill a friend. - Friends. - The woman said that three would enter the cave, but only one would leave. But she was wrong. (dramatic music) - [Tashi] Dyala! (growling) (dramatic music) (yelling) (dramatic music) (growling) (yelling) (dramatic music) (yelling) (growling) (somber music) - The Shunaris are outside the walls Omnipotent Lord. There's no sign of the sword. (laughs) But the High Priest is carrying the Spirit Stone. And it's glowing in the night like a torch. Our spies say that it will replace the sword. - So the old fool has gambled his soul. (laughs) We'll see who wins. (dramatic music) (chatter) - [Amazon] But what's the formation? - [Amazon] You know. (talking) - Our only chance is to get into the city. Once we're inside Kalunga won't throw his bolts. They'll hit his own men as well as ours. - Would that really matter to him? - I will deflect the bolts as long as I can. Pray that it will be enough. - Alright, begin the attack. (dramatic music) (thunder clapping) - [Woman] There he is. (dramatic music) (thunder clapping) (dramatic music) - You're lost priest! Lost! (dramatic music) (laughing) You shouldn't have priest, now you all die! (laughs) - I'll never get there in time. - Henar will get you there. - Even on a horse it'll take days to get there. - Henar is more than just a horse. And my sword is more than just a weapon. (dramatic music) - Your sword? Azundati. Are you deathless? - Deathless, or just dead, like the past. Now listen well child, there isn't much time if you want to be the future. Please rise, Henar will take you through the Weirways. - The Weirways. (soft music) - It's the only way Dyala. There are roads in the Weirways that go between time and space. Henar knows those roads. The way is dangerous, but you hold the sword. The sword's touch can kill Balgur. - But this is your sword Azundati. - No longer, I was the holder, and I paid the price, to wait here for the next one. You Dyala. (dramatic music) - Will you take care of Tashi for me? - I already have. (dramatic music) (groaning) (dramatic music) (yelling) (dramatic music) - [Balgur] Dyala! Dyala! (dramatic music) (laughing) (dramatic music) (laughing) (groaning) (dramatic music) - What can we do? - Arban, go out and get as many prisoners as you can for the Weirways! - Open the gates. - Everything is lost. Look! (dramatic music) - You cannot defeat me, I have the power! - Head through the gates! (dramatic music) (yelling) Kalunga! Where are you? (dramatic music) Kalunga! Come out! Are you afraid of me? (dramatic music) (groaning) (dramatic music) (head banging on ground) - Stone! (dramatic music) (groaning) (groaning) (groaning) (groaning) (yelling) (dramatic music) - Kalunga! (groans) Now you die! (yelling) Stop fighting! Put down your weapons! It's over! (dramatic music) (yelling) (cheers) - Tshingi traitor? I would never have imagined it. Hegblond will find her and bring her to our justice. - Tashi wasn't like her mother. She was sent to kill me, she died for me instead. - She will always be honored, as will you as holder of the sword. - There is another holder. - Another? What do you mean? - Azundati still lives. - Alive? It seems impossible. - She said I would have to pay a price. Maybe it was Tashi's death. - You are a person with a name now Dyala. And I want you to become the new commander of the Amazons. Well, do you accept? (groaning) Dyala, what is it? (groaning) - Someone's killing my tree. (groaning) Someone is killing my tree! (dramatic music) - Tshingi! - Why kill your soul when I can cut your body to pieces? (dramatic music) (yelling) (dramatic music) You're going to die, just as your cursed mother and father did. - No! (yelling) - I'm going to kill you the way you killed Tashi! - I didn't kill Tashi, you did! (dramatic music) - Where's your magic now? (dramatic music) (yelling) (dramatic music) (wind blowing) - Azundati? Azundati are you here? (soft music) (crying) (soft music) (laughing) - She told me you'd come back. - How is this possible? - Azundati. - Where is she? - She said her work was done, the price paid. I saw how my mother died. - I'm sorry Tashi. - I'm not. She tried to be a mother to me in her own way, but she couldn't. You Dyala, you become my sister. - I was going to take the sword back to the cave. I hope we don't have to use it for another 500 years. (neighing) I think he can carry two. (dramatic music)
