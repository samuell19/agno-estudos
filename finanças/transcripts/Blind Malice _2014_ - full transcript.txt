EIGHT YEARS AGO, PEDIATRICIAN, DR. HASKIN SETTLED OUT OF COURT FOR AN UNDISCLOSED AMOUNT OF MONEY. NOW, HE WAS BEING ACCUSED OF INAPPROPRIATELY TOUCHING HIS PATIENTS DURING ROUTINE EXAMINATIONS. HIS PATIENTS ARE NINE, AND TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRLS. NO CHARGES WERE FILED. HE WALKED. HE'S INNOCENT. FAST FORWARD TO TODAY. SEEMS LIKE IT'S HAPPENED AGAIN. WE'RE NOW IN ROUND THREE OF CLOSED DOOR MEETINGS. THIS TIME HE'S BEING CHARGED OF INAPPROPRIATELY TOUCHING A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL. HERE'S WHAT ATTORNEYS HAD TO SAY. [ATTORNEY] OBVIOUSLY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FAMILY AND WE'VE REACHED OUT TO THEM TO SEE IF THERE'S BEEN A POSSIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING. [REPORTER] COMING CLEAN? WELL, IT'S CLEAR THAT OUR POSITION IS THAT THERE'S INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO ACTUALLY FORMALLY PRESS CHARGES. [REPORTER] DID YOUR CLIENT MOLEST BOYS, TOO? LOOK, UNLESS THEY CAN PROVE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEIR CLAIM, I WANNA REMIND THE PUBLIC THAT IT'S SIMPLY THEIR WORD AGAINST OURS. AND OUR CLIENT IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE. AND I BELIEVE THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT DR. HASKIN EVER MOLESTED ANY LITTLE GIRL. SO, IT IS WHAT IT IS. [FAUCET SPLASHING] [DRIPS] INDESCRIBABLE. INDESCRIBABLE. [ROXY BARKING FAINTLY] ROXY. NANNA?
