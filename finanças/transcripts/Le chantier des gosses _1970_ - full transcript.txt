The Children's Building Site with the inhabitants of the Marolles and pupils from schools n°6 and n°9 and with land surveyor Derom and his team Camera Dialogues Music A film by Tomorrow we're going to the shack with all our friends. Are you in? We'll have a good time. There'll be a whole lot of us. Look, there's Jef's girl. Let's pester her. A good way to pass the time. Look, she's picking petals. You want to know if he loves you? Ask him. You'll know for sure. She wouldn't dare. Yeah, that's true. - You're stupid! Here you go! Leave me alone, you idiot. Hey you there! Get out of the way. Still there? What are you doing? Leave us alone! Look what I'm doing. He'll break it! Them again. I'm fed up with them. Leave me alone, you bully. Go away! Be careful with our marbles. What's with him? He's crazy! Are you still around? Beat it! You'll see when my big brother is here. Time to leave. He's furious. Who cares, let's go back. Boo! Beanpole! What a pain in the neck. Who does he think he is? What a fuss! He sure needs a lot of space for his scope. Now we've lost our playground... ... what are we going to do? We can't stay home all day. We could play with the sacristan's chicken. To pester the old one? Good idea! Imagine, the sacristan has a chick. Brats. Be careful. That's a good one. They're still around? Jesus Christ, the scoundrels. I'm going to the police. Would be great to find one now. A perfect joke. We'll laugh our heads off. There! Got it! Tie the rope. I'll do it. I won't let it go. It could scratch you. Don't strangle it. Wait, I'll help you. It's okay now. Get set! What is a war nowadays? With all these machines... ... it's a child's game. It was very different before. Nowadays it doesn't amount to anything. Is this all you can tell? Make your coffee. They drop you on the right spot. But we, whether we wanted to or not... ... had to get there... ... by bicycle. The bicycle-soldiers... ... that was a real army. We were drilled... ... believe me. We were no softies. Up early in the morning, stripped to the waist exercising in the snow. You and your constant war stories. We were the toughest. We've lost our playground. How awful. We hadn't done anything. Thrown out. Our cart broken. We should nail the door so they can't come in any more. And flatten their ties. That's not enough. We have to get organised. To set up a plan of attack. Lead them into a trap. An eye for an eye. We'll chase them. Someone's got a lighter? It's a matter of tactics. During the war my father would trap the enemy just like rabbits because he was smarter than them. The other day my father told me... Who's got a lighter? ... to make slingshots... ... with the best rubber bands we find. And when we're well trained... ... we attack! Rubber bands like that! A smashing slingshot! Aimed at their arses. They'll learn their lesson well. They'll be sorry. Terrific! Look, I've got a stick for you. What a beautiful stick. Look what I got from my brother. He's a great chap. What a rubber band. For sure we'll beat them. Golly, this is difficult. This one launches cobbles. I think it will be a hard fight. Soon we'll be in top condition. Some well aimed stones... ... and the job is done. Isn't it, boys? One, two, one, two... Come on Freddy. Keep the spirit. One, two, one, two... Okay, we know you're the leader. Stop annoying us. My turn. Got it. Be careful! I count and you shoot. Missed. Argh, the window. Again. Aim better. Put them back. - Already? Ready to attack? Things will get pretty hot. It'll be a tough one. This is our plan. I'm in the front line behind the verge. We attack first. Don't do anything until I say so. No worries, we'll be deadly quiet. Do not attack until they start running. And no chaos. One man each. Let's go. Shhht, not a word. There! They don't have a clue... What do you think, they can't see us. If only they knew what's going to happen. Hopefully the others keep quiet. They're setting up. Shut up. What are they doing? They're putting down their things. When do we attack? Keep quiet. Keep calm you... ... or they'll see us. So shut up. They're going to get it. Sure. We've got them well. I'd like to see their faces... ... when they reach for their pockets. Serves them. They were fearing for their lives. The guy running holding his ass! The watch is mine. The banana's mine. The chocolate mine. - And the cigarettes... I'll take the mirror. And I the book. Great. A pity there's only one. What a delicious apple. Heavy tobacco. Useless bloke. What a stupid book. The watch in exchange for your marbles. Do you have a lot? One, two, three... At least fifty. They're all yours. Hey Freddy. Three are broken. Hello Jef. Want to play with me? Try it. What are you doing? - No, like this. Hold the mirror in the sun... ... and aim it at the man at the window. Give it to me. Like this. Let me try again. Brats... Won't it stop? Enough! What's going on? I'm coming. Be careful, that's sharp. Enough of it! You've been making noise for an hour! What a pest. Turn the radio on. - Aye aye Sir. ... stealing, lying or cheating. The happy life in the barracks... ... where body and spirit are educated... ... and where everyone enjoys... ... the comfort a human being needs... ... makes one learn to love one's country... ... family and relatives. And here is the request. To celebrate his leave of service... ... soldier Durant requests... ... a record for his comrades. Time for dinner! For the umpteenth time, stop reading while you eat. I didn't do anything. Freddy, your bag! Give me back what you've taken. I haven't taken anything. We'll see. Sure. Here, ape. They're going to fight. Come on Freddy. Don't be afraid! Hit harder! You can beat him! - Get up! Bastard, he did have it. Could you repair my watch? That won't be easy. It's in a bad shape. What happened? It fell on the floor. That I can see. Just try it. A drink? - A beer. Hello boys. Hello boss. What's up? You're so quiet. Sleepy. - No wonder, with these machines. Shall we play anyway? As if he got a blow on his head. With all that noise. Well... Shall we play? That'll do you good. And here are the drinks. Pass us the backgammon. Here you are. Enjoy. - Thanks. Still at work. We women never get rest. What a noise, these machines all day. Everyone stressed, and my cat gets crazy. It's hellish. This hammering makes my head ache. Hopefully it will soon be over. We don't feel home in our street. This is no life. Only now is it getting quiet. Time for something else. It's true... Men have their beer and backgammon. Could you empty the basin? Everything all right? Everybody talks and complains about it. Your turn. Always in the pub. Always the same. Listen Flup. Go and get your father. Worse than the machines is the demolishing. Here! Being evicted is no laugh. Great! Nobody's asking your opinion. Renting elsewhere is more expensive. Mama needs you. All right. What's the worry? Never quiet. No peace ever with that woman. Hello. Everything okay? We should repair the shack. Especially the roof. - It's worthless. I know where we can find planks. Where? They're leaving. Follow me. Don't step on my hands. Don't push me. I'm glad I'm out of here. Take this one. It's too heavy. Drop it. Hurry up. You and your good advice. Be careful. To the left. Great Freddy. All right. Put them down. Now we have to saw them. Saw here. Come in. Sit down. We have a tube. The large radius is 7,5 cm. And the small one 7 cm. The height is 80 cm, the weight 2,8. What's the weight of this tube? What is the problem actually? We need the volume of the big cylinder. And then? Substract the volume of the small cylinder. How do we find the volume of a cylinder? Area of the base times... times... Times what? What is the form of the base? A circle. And how do we find its area? Pi r² times height. And in numbers? Who can express it in numbers? Freddy. And the second cylinder? 3,14 times 7 to the square. To the square. To the square times 80. 80. Now the second mass can be subtracted... ... from the first one... ... and what do we get? The mass of the tube. Pass me the cards. This makes a good table. Three, three, three... Here's the trump. No cheating. Wait. Trump. What are you doing? It's for me. One never knows with you. King of spades. It's mine. Here, clubs. King of Diamonds. Mine again. Diamonds. Freddy wins again. Lucky devil. Hello! Where's Jeanjean? Home. I'll go and get him. Be quick, we have to play. Are you coming? Come here. Come up! - If you dare. How did you get there? Let's go. Did you start it? Aren't you scared? Check this. Will you be able to stop it? Will you be able to stop it? Jeanjean, what happened? Are you hurt? What happened? Let's carry him. It hurts. Let's go inside. Not all together. I don't dare. You go. You know her. Yesterday was such a panic. Bobby had disappeared. What are you telling me now? He came back in the evening, but I couldn't get angry at him. My Coco is unbelievable. Those animals are so surprising. He is so clever. He can say such things... A dog is true and doesn’t ask questions. I see, he's so cute. I can't live without him. But I prefer my parrot. Thank you. Would you like some coffee? He's like a child. As I told you... - I understand. He damages my reputation... ... but I can't live without him. Without him I would be lonely. Sometimes he turns his back on me... ... or he's mad at me. He refuses his peanuts. He's like a baby. Coco is so cute. Freddy! Jeanjean has had an accident. But nothing bad. How do you mean? We took him to the hospital. The doctor told us it wasn't too serious. The doctor? It's not our fault. We don't know how it happened. Bad boys! Telling me it's nothing serious. We didn't do anything. What's holding me back! Tell me the truth. How did it happen? We were playing. Where not allowed, of course. We were playing on the building site. He fell... - On the building site. Don't you know that playing there... ... is dangerous? Within two weeks he'll be all right. Such a fall could be serious. But he only has a broken arm... ... and some contusions. - May he go home? He'd better stay a while. Nothing but bad luck. Our son is in the hospital. They were playing on the building site. The doctor says it isn't serious, but is he telling the truth? That's why they didn't show up... and the little one came home alone. What were you up to there? Just taking a look, on the building site without touching anything. Before we'd be there all the time. Het was ons terrein. It was our site. It was supposed to be the last time. We didn't mean no harm. You can't enter a building site. Didn't you know? Eh... no. You with your rascally plans. We didn't intend to harm. You prefer your silly tricks to school. Jeanjean could have died. Is the street not enough? You don't care at all. We didn't know he would fall. I wasn't alone on the site. No respect for the parents. Shame on you. And the little one follows you. Aren't you ashamed? Don't you understand anything? Get out of here before I give you a beating. Cheer up, everything will be all right. I should go and... ... burn a candle in the church. That won't heal the boy. Waste of time. Doctors, all good and well. Candles are useless. Jesus, have mercy upon us... Take care of the poor for once. Don't let the same suffer again and again. Don't bring misfortune on us. It's unjust what happens to us. Here are the rascals. You should be watched by two policemen. You can be proud. No other ambitions than doing silly things? You're getting dangerous... ... and this time you went too far. I'm at my wit's end. Young offender institution, I'm telling you. They're afraid of nothing. They enter a building site, put the crane into action, and the elevator. Do you realise he could have died... ... just like the lot of you? We could take the parents to court. The juvenile court will judge. Those who break the law must be punished. What do you think, Sir? Tomorrow, in everyone's presence, you will be disciplined. You won't forget your punishment easily. If a policeman spots these criminals again they will hear from me. Now get out of my sight. All good and well, Sir, but basically this changes nothing. Go back to your classes. And walk the straight path. You have to set an example. Don't you think their friend's accident was enough of a punishment? As you wish, Sir, but... ... I won't tolerate any misbehaviour. How are things today? This won't hurt. Crying for so little... ... a big boy like you. Hello Jeanjean. The poor devil. You're okay here, after all. You have everything you need. And, how are you? Cool enough. We brought you some goodies. Apples. Thank you. Cigarettes. I missed this. Thanks Richard. The headmaster summoned us. Everyone is mad at us. Boy, did we get in trouble for it. And your father is furious at me. And this here. Do you think this is fun? You're fine here. Help yourselves. Do they take good care of you? I get injections... ... but the nurse is good-looking so... So there was a big fuss at school? Sure. It's not nice here. I'm bored. You're lucky. We have to go. See you. Take care. Everything worked out well. Jeanjean is back home. But we won't see Jef any more. Why? Francine... How sad. Dropping his friends like this. How terrible. - And all this for a girl. That beats everything. THE END
