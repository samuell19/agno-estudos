I saw them back in '70. I thought I would never see them again. They might just be passing, Charles. Are they mean? They're here. I won't let it happen. Don't go! My poor wife. My poor girls. Mother! FROM THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF 6th September, nine o'clock. When the battle for France is about to begin the time for looking back is past; every effort must be focused on attacking and throwing the enemy back. Troops which cannot advance must die rather than give way. Under present conditions no weakness can be tolerated. Signed: JOFFRE. Message to be conveyed immediately. It's just you and me, Excellency. We can speak the truth. Defeat on the Marne, Defeat in Flanders. We failed. German victory has only been delayed. Yes. Until spring, let's rely only on our submarines... May God punish Britain. ...and on our secret agents. The emperor wants us back on the offensive. But the offensive continues on an invisible front. In the shadows, Excellency. In France alone, before the war, I had 15,000 agents, which are now equal to five army corps. France is full of surprises. All of my intelligence agrees: France's days are numbered. We're still figuring things out, Admiral. When the war began, everything here was chaos but we soon got the intelligence office working. Then they must keep me informed, time is short. In the week from 15th to 22nd April, the Germans sank 88 Allied ships. Where do their submarines get supplies? In Spain. But the exact location of their base? Who leads this organization? Your agents don't act. My agents? I don't have the budget, Admiral. And spies cost a lot. Sometimes an awful lot. Listen. Right now, in San Sebastián, the Germans... EVERY EVENING AT THE ALHAMBRA: MATA HARI IN HER NEW DANCES MS. MATA HARI, HOTEL CONTINENTAL It's him. He asks when he can see me again. Very good. I knew he would fall for it. He still loves me. - Where did you meet him? - In Constantinople. He worked for us at the time. He now works for the French for money... To give me money. So he doesn't know that you are H21? No. So we're going to get rid of him? Of course. - When? - Tomorrow. - Here? - Why not, my darling? Very well. Kiss me. Get rid of your cigarette! You don't love me anymore? Me? I'm crazy about you! And this H21 can simply be countered with an agent that is already old, who has worked for Germany in the past, a man who's not reliable. I think it has to be a woman. Women are as treacherous as the sea. I should know. And for what I ask of them, this malice is an advantage. And they are better at adapting. They put on an act easily. It is still surprising to see how cunning the most innocent woman can be. They have certain methods that are... - Irresistible... - I see it all the time. Every day. But most of them are corruptible and have no scruples. I would like to find one who is dedicated. But where? - I want to speak to him. - No. - But I need to speak to him. - No. - Okay? - I want to see the major. The major isn't here. He isn't here? - I'll come back. - Understood. Major! Come with me. Who told you I was the major? No one. So how did you know? When I saw you, I knew. Where have you come from? - The north. - On foot? Yes. Yes, Major. Yes. When I met a car that was happy to take me, I got in. The police didn't stop you at all? - No. - Listen... Who do you know in Paris? No one. - Do you have papers? - Yes, Major. Here. NATIONAL SAVINGS BOOK You speak German? Yes, Major. Daddy was from Alsace. Come on, tell me who sent you. Who? Come on, quick! Of course... You're not much of an actress, my girl. What's troubling you? What? Are you frightened? No. I'm hungry. Corbier! Corbier! A sandwich! No, two. And a bottle of wine. Put it here, on the corner. Very well, Major. Do you believe me? Tell me, Major? We have time. - Are you feeling better? - Oh yes, much better. Thank you. Your parents? They shot both of them against the barn wall. They burnt down the village, I escaped with my little sister. Where is she? Her name was Susanne. I am all alone now. But... Ah yes, André. He was my fiancé. He was due to be discharged on September 14th and we were going to marry at Christmas, once he had a job. I'm telling you all my unimportant stories... I have two letters from him, and a card, that's all. - This is him? - Yes. I want to do something useful, Major, I want to serve. I have a teaching diploma. I'll make you a nurse at an auxiliary hospital. No. - Why not? - No. Caring for the injured is good but it's not enough. No. I want to deal with them directly, like soldiers do. I want to hurt them. They killed my father, my mother. They caused the deaths of Susanne and André. I want revenge. I won't be happy until I have revenge. I respect your feelings, Marthe, but you delude yourself. Let me prove myself anyway. You wouldn't succeed, you're too young and have the inexperience of a country girl. But I think my hatred would help me. And then, if they kill me too, that wouldn't be a great loss. Lie down! Oh, there's the crazy one! Take the back stairs. Should I get a return ticket? No, a single. The return is never certain. I speak to you bluntly, Marthe, but our last agent was found last week in San Sebastián behind the Hotel Continental, lying with a bullet in their head. Oh? To give myself courage, I only have to remember. Your youth makes you naive. You will be dealing with powerful people. Let's see, Marthe. Tell me your mission one last time. I've made you come to my house to ensure secrecy. I'm listening. Find out the precise location of the supply bases of the submarines. - Crucial, Marthe. - Yes. In due course, find out about the torpedo plans and tell you immediately. Discover the name of enemy agents, and any intelligence that will help defend France. And by any means necessary. By any means available to a woman. Marthe, you understand? Yes. Obviously, I have qualms about insisting. Think about it. Can I give you my response in three days? Yes. I don't want to influence your decision. Hold on, I must be fair. These are the two people with whom you must form a relationship that is as intimate as possible. The one on the right, Von Falken, cold, deceitful, exact former attaché of the ambassador in Paris and London. Speaks French without an accent. The one on the left is the infamous von Ludow. Charged with a secret mission before the war. An aristocrat without scruples, an appreciator of art and beauty, a pianist... Formidable! Injured twice, in Belgium and at the Marne. Captain of the lancers when the war began. It seems to me that you prefer von Ludow. I'll go. Tomorrow. Always the same women in this place. Yes. I miss Berlin. In San Sebastián, the beer is undrinkable. It's nothing but stick insects. Oh, give me a woman with curves... The sailors are already drunk. Sloshed mariners and submarines. Are you crazy? - The mariners... - Okay, that's enough... You're too loud. This place is full of spies. - We know them all. - That's enough, okay? Oh, she's beautiful! I'm off. I've had enough. - Are you coming? - No. I'm staying till the morning. Who's that? - Where? - There. Nice dress. Nice body. Err... Goodnight? Von Ludow. Do you live in San Sebastián, señora? - German? - No. French? - Yes, sir. - I should have known that straightaway. And you, sir? Swiss? Dutch? - German. - Really? - Parisian? - Yes. Of course. Parisian chic. I love Paris. I love France. Oh, this war... What's happening? It's closing already? No. It's Mata Hari's number. - Who? - Mata Hari. A famous dancer, very popular in Paris. I've never heard of her. She has danced at the Odéon, and at the Université des Annales. - Would you like something to drink? - Why, yes. This is von Falken. The dancer has attracted quite the crowd. 23 seats filled already. Do you know who you look like? Isolde. Isolde? Tristan and Isolde. Ah! I had no idea! Poor woman, she's hurt herself. - Do you mind? - Take your time. Stay lying down. - Does it hurt there? - Yes. Tell the orchestra to play. - Yes, I'm going to. - And don't let anyone in here. Except his Lordship. A sprain, your Lordship. Oh, you... Since you're on your own in San Sebastián I would be happy to act as your guide, madam, if you would allow me. Thank you, sir, Baron von Ludow has already offered. But he is not free. But he said he would be at my service from morning to evening. You've seen how quickly he goes to see... This dancer monopolizes him. Oh, really... What exactly is Baron von Ludow doing in San Sebastián? Well, nothing. He is waiting for this terrible blood-bath to end, as am I. - As are you, no doubt, madam. - Yes. I came here to look for a bit of sun, a bit of escapism. Where are you staying? Hotel Continental. The best. - Yes. - At least, it is peaceful. I don't like gossip, lies and affairs, and I love to swim. There is a pool like in America. You know America? Yes, my mother was American. I saw how you looked at her. Keep your eyes on me. The little bitch! She used the old trick of purity, innocence. And you, you let yourself be taken in. You fool! Poor fool! - A Frenchwoman... - Calm down! Are you offended? Because I see it clearly... Keep on and she'll be the death of you. Have you lived in France long? No. My parents sent me to boarding school in Lausanne from a young age. - I had a lot of German friends. - So you speak German? No, my friends had come to learn French. Of course, like everyone I can say Wasser, Wein, Guten Morgen. But you stayed in contact with your German friends? We can't write anymore. I may have a way of sending your letters. Really? I would appreciate it. This war has complicated and disrupted everything. It has severed relationships. When will it end? Never. Not unless people who are immune to laws and prejudices decide to end it. If that were possible, I'd love to serve that cause. But how? You only have to trust me. What needs to be done? Nothing. Watch, listen. - Keep me informed. - Am I up to it? Of course, you would gain some material advantages. Are we in agreement? I think so. Could you, for example, return to France next week? - Oh, no. - Why not? No, I will be in Venice. You won't be staying in San Sebastián longer? Why? There is nothing to keep me here and I like change... I love you, Eric. I'm sorry. You disgust me. Good. Ludow. Would you like to dance? It would look a bit too intentional right now... It's not serious, I hope? She danced well! Falken seems angry, don't you think? I just taught him something. What did he say to you? - Shall we talk about something else? - Why? Oh... - Is he your friend? - My friend? No? I thought he was. He was audacious enough to suggest... It's a bit embarrassing... Never mind. He was audacious enough to suggest that I should spy on his behalf. To me. - No tact. - Exactly. Oh... He isn't as refined as you. Your manners of a man of the world. You don't like him? There are 1000 ways of getting a message across, 1000 nuances. - If he had said to me... - Madam... The countryside is very pretty. Would you like to come on a drive with me tomorrow? We will talk, in the proper way. There you go! By the way... Do you have any family or friends in French ports? - Yes, in Bordeaux. - Excellent. Germany knows how to reward those who serve it. I should hope so. - Here. - Thank you. Open it. It's the first task. How many planes are there at Villacoublay? Has the new SPAD fighter aircraft been tested? Where are the new anti-aircraft sites around Paris? - Is that all? - That's all. - But that's very easy. - We'll see... Thank you. Never keep the paper. And the two of them in the car, seen from the front. What do you say? It's a good little device. Really? That's your camera? - Yes. - Very good, very good. Yes, only, tell me, I would have liked them in a busier place. Dressed in a more compromising way. At the baths, at a dance. Excellency, my robe prevents me from... As you are a pretend priest... Exactly, I have to be more careful. Okay, I'll take all of these. - Good. - So, thank you. - Goodbye, Excellency. - Bye. MINISTRY OF WAR 48 hours ago, a German submarine sank two more transporters. A million tonnes sunk each month. Supplies for the armies at the front are at risk. France's survival depends on the sea. Germany is winning the war. I had to alert the secret committee but I have read the key documents: Admiral Jellicoe's telegram to the British attaché in Washington. A confidential message from the US ambassador in Britain to President Wilson. And another telegram from Admiral Sims. Hold on. Would you like to read them? I am aware of these documents. I gave them to the government. Still, these revelations do not seem to have motivated your services. I ask, again, the question that you still have not answered: Where are the enemy submarine bases located in Spain? In San Sebastián, von Ludow has had many successes. His audacity never ends! Let the major reply. - So? - Be patient. Patience, patience... But it's been three years. I hope to know soon. Facts, details. No more hopes, just results. Who do you have serving France there? - Who? - Yes, who? A woman. A woman? Are you serious? A woman, yes, Admiral. A woman who has patiently, skillfully approached the inaccessible von Ludow, becoming more indispensable to him each day. - Of course... - No, no, no. Not like that. No. A young girl who has tamed the beast. Who has won him over and controls him. Now, he is convinced that she is betraying us. He is ours. Here, look. - Is it possible? - Let me see. - Here. - Thank you. - Obviously... - Pretty... She's a spy? Never! Good shot. Good shot. Very well done! Good. Oh, you missed. No. In the same hole. Your turn. - Shoot when I tell you. - Okay. In the forehead. Good. In the arm. Very good. In the heart. What? You're right, I'm a liar. France sent me to kill you. In the heart? That's it. You've lost. Your servants are used to the sound of gunshots on the metal. No one will come. Go on then... Quickly... On three, I'll shoot. One, two... Very hurtful. Really? You weren't scared? No. Really? - I was scared. - So? Do you still think ill of me? You still suspect me? What proof do you need? Well? Marthe... What? Nothing. Patience. I'll discredit her to the French Deuxième Bureau. But, after all, she's doing her job. Besides, I've alerted Berlin, sent reports, photos, etc. It's mainly Ludow who has treated you terribly. I won't argue with him anymore, on the contrary, I smile... But the torpedoing of troops going from Morocco to France that he has planned for the 17th, thanks to my intelligence, will fail. I've taken precautions for this. - And there you have it! - Perfect! His shot misses and ours hits home. One by one, the gunpowder factories will blow up mysteriously. The filling factories too. Throughout southeast France, thanks to you, it's all ready. My dear friend... I will never forget what I owe you. Oh! Let's see! You don't trust me? If we bring down Eric and his Frenchwoman, that will be my reward. But not at all! Ludow sacked, his Frenchwoman executed, winning us Berlin's trust! We will have control of the service. And with a loving collaboration! Von Ludow is parading around with this Frenchwoman. He knows what he is doing, Excellency. Falken fears that he's not as vigilant around such a pretty woman, and that the torpedo attacks are compromised. Falken should mind his own business. He needs to get gunpowder factories in southwest France blown up. Good, isn't it? Next? Don't tell anyone about these missions. Don't become friendly with other agents, even those of the same service. Do not drink any alcohol whatsoever. Very good. Thank you. Pardon? You understand German? - No. - But you do. Don't start this again. Believe what I say. Remember, I don't speak your beautiful language. I don't need to speak it, since you're sending me to France. Still so distrustful... Oh... One fine day, I won't come back. Oh... Drink... To our success. Oh... You're only thinking of yourself. The Villacoublay hangar will blow up, don't worry. I will destroy the only prototype of the new French fighter aircraft. What kind of woman are you? You will find out one day... Later... Magnificent creature. Oh, I would have to be crushed under rubble or arrested by the French to convince you. I would have to be shot. If you die, I die. - You aren't serious. - Me? I wonder what those men in Berlin would think or even the advisor von Falken, if they saw you in this ridiculous position. You teach me to be the perfect spy but you break your own rules. You don't want me being with other agents, then jump on me without warning. You could at least have asked me. You wanted to mess around, am I right? - But... - While we're on the subject... Please keep things formal. Understood. - Do you have the exploding pencil? - Yes. Have a good journey. THE GERMAN SUBMARINE U. 22 SUNK BY OUR FLEET IN THE MEDITERRANEAN OUR FLEET JUST SANK A GERMAN SUBMARINE ANOTHER GERMAN SUBMARINE DESTROYED BY OUR FLEET Falken was right. It's this Frenchwoman who has paralysed Ludow. Not only did the torpedo attacks that he told us about not happen on the 17th, but the French sank our U22 this time. Look at these maps, Excellency. You see: covered. Each dot marks the place where a ship has been sunk. Von Ludow accomplished all this. Let's allow him a mistake. This Frenchwoman of whom you disapprove and who Falken accuses has been sent by von Ludow to Villacoublay to destroy the new French fighter aircraft prototype. - We'll see. - After all... What has your Falken done that's so surprising? Him? All at once, he's going to destroy all the factories in the southwest of France. We'll see. Don't be annoyed. I told you we would receive a reply at three o'clock. Wait. It is three o'clock! Then the response is here. I trust my people. Pedro! - Pedro! - Yes! Here you go! Here you go! I can't be everywhere at once. So what did you say? The funeral is on Saturday at the cemetery at 11 a.m. Got it. Here you go. Buy yourself some sweets. - Thank you, sir. - Off you go! Sorry, the kid was just here. Oh! That's great work! What did she say? Funeral, Saturday, 11 .a.m., cemetery. Good. Next Saturday, at 11:30 p.m., a man and a woman will arrive here. - They work for us. - And how will I recognize them? I will give you their photo in good time. You will meet them. Can I trust these two pilgrims? Ask Mata. The strike on the port of Southampton was them. The Gap gunpowder factories, also them. The rigged thermometers, them as well. The woman is a medical doctor, the man studied engineering in Leipzig. - Good people, as you can see. - I see. My interest in the matter? Ten thousand, a fixed price. Alright. Ah, you're going to have a nice coffee. Where have you come from? Far away. Deserter? No. Escaped prisonner. Why haven't you returned to France? Go back to France, go back to the front? No. I came here to find someone. Once I have told her what's bothering me, I won't mind dying. My ministry takes me to many quarters. If this person is a foreigner, it is likely that I know them. Will you tell me their name? Richard. Marthe Richard. I don't know her. No matter. I'll find her. I must find her. No matter what, I will find her. Would you serve France? How? I'm here illegally. Don't worry, my child. That can be sorted. So? You control this von Ludow? I think so, yes. Have you had to use all your methods? Oh no... No! Even better! Keep it up! Von Ludow really has bad luck. - H21 warned us in time. - Huh? The torpedo attack due on 17th... - Yesterday? - It didn't take place. But we sank their submarine. - As well! - That's good! Ludow really has bad luck. - Is this familiar? - But that's him. That's me! See, you're being watched. - Who took this photo? - A French agent. That's funny. Because that morning, there was only a priest outside the hotel. - That's him. - No! Come in! It's the southwest business again, Major. You can talk. The lady doctor and the engineer from Leipzig due to meet Falken tomorrow have been arrested by our agents. Here are their photos. Very good, very good! Thank you. - Well, you look happy. - Quite! Sit down, Marthe. You will soon have another chance to distinguish yourself. Oh? Doing what? Once you arrive in San Sebastián, tomorrow, at three p.m., you will go to the church of Santa Maria. Yes. You will enter the confessional on the right, while watching the choir. There you will find out what awaits you. Someone will say "southwest", you will reply "yes", and you will listen. - I can't know now? - No, no, no, no! No curiosity. No impatience. Be disciplined. Here is the explosive pencil that you gave me. I've had it analyzed. It's ingenious. Pieces of it will be found in the rubble of the hangar. The newspapers will be angered by the discovery and will reproduce the photo of the destroyed hangar that I have here. How...? How...? You have a photo of the explosion before the explosion? It's to save time. CONFIDENTIAL Excellent! Magnificent! Let's not exaggerate. One more victory. Luck was on my side. When I saw the hangar blow up, I thought of you. I said to myself: "This time, at least, he will believe me." Absolutely. 2EME BUREAU CONFIDENTIAL SECRET What is this? H21! Oh! Oh yes, that's right, I forgot! You don't have an agent with this number? I do, why? Do not trust them. The torpedoing of troops from Morocco on 17th... The attack failed, the U22 was sunk since the French admiralty was warned in time, by the agent. Bitch! Oh, it's a woman? Excuse me. Yes? One moment. Bitch! - Stay. - No, you're waiting for someone. Oh! Stay! No, sorry, I can't. Where to? Stop interrogating me all the time! I have the right to know! What do you mean? - I want to know. - Well... As I do each year, I'm just going to confession. I'm sorry. Where? Which church? You're doing it again... At Santa Maria. Lady MacLeod. Have you met? We are neighbours at the Continental, miss. - That's quite possible, madam. - I'm in appartment number seven. Oh, how silly of me! I didn't recognize you in that dress! I clapped for you the other night. How is your foot? - Much better. - Thank you. Good! How lovely to have met you at our friend's house, madam. - Are we dining together? - But of course! - Here? - Of course. See you this evening. - But... - Oh, don't make a scene... - The dilemma of the woman... - You were right. I find her charming. - Are you sleeping with her, as well as me? - Not necessary. I need money. It's over. Listen, it's too silly to stay angry. It's my fault. But love isn't all there is. There's work, danger, success. I let you sink 26 ships, after all. So you understand? I felt very bad when I found out that our torpedo attack of 17th had failed. Poor Eric, in Berlin, it's a black mark against you. I've been betrayed. By whom? Don't trust your contacts. You can't stop now that you've failed. I will sacrifice myself for you, one more time. I will go to Paris, get new intelligence for you. You will sink them again, the French, the British... and the neutral countries, because that's the order now. But, I must say, I need money. - Right now? - In the next few days. On Tuesday, in Paris, at the Crédit Lyonnais bank, you will find a check from Stockholm, in your name: 15,000 pesetas. - Okay? - You've saved my life! Don't laugh, it's true! Southwest? Southwest? Yes. Call me "father," quite loudly. Yes, father. Are you free this evening and tonight? No, father. I'm going to dinner. - With whom? - With von Ludow. Not possible. On leaving the church, go straight to this address. A nurse will be waiting for you. She will give you clothes and disguise you. - Why? - Don't try to understand yet. The nurse will explain it to you. Careful... Someone... Father, I confess to having... Is that everything, my child? Good. For your penitence, you must recite the psalm... Why are you here? I was waiting for you. Again. It isn't kind... I've had enough of being suspected and followed all the time... Well, have I lied? No, evidently not. So? I won't do this anymore. I will offer my services to Falken, who asked for my help and will at least be appreciative. So you understand? Yes. The submarine has been warned? No. Enough! The woman will arrive first at 11:30 p.m., and the man at 11:35 p.m. You will let them in yourself by the yard door and take them up. And their photo? Here they are. Distinguishing features: the man has a stammer, and the woman lisps slightly. - They're two comedians... - Be quiet. Take a good look at these. Compare them to the originals, discreetly, and then destroy them. Oh... Still no news of Marthe's address? I think I'm making progress. Oh? Close your mouth. You may see her again soon. What have you found out? - Don't talk, damn it. - Is there news? Where will I find her? This evening, focus on your mission. It's getting there. With a little white on the eyebrows, and brushed the wrong way. That's not bad at all. With the glasses... I think we will get it just right. We will sort the hair later. There you go. I baptize you a Leipzig engineering graduate. 1,76 meters, small blond moustache, small goatee, and a stammer as well. I don't... kn... know the lady doc... doctor... That's not bad. Here, this is the doctor. - Oh! - Yes, she's quite a sight. Tell me, will you definitely recognize the Café Dupont that we passed by earlier? Oh, that would be unfortunate. Good, be there at 11:35 p.m., at the door that opens onto the alley. At 11:35 p.m. tonight, the owner will be waiting for the real engineer from Leipzig and the real doctor who will sadly be locked away at that time and usefully replaced by you. Follow me. Good evening, doctor. Good evening, chief. Thank you. Please do sit. When was the strike on Southampton? Don't speak of Southampton. No false modesty. H21 has kept me informed. That's good. My dear friend. G... g... good evening, sir. Good evening, sir. P... p... pleased to meet you. And you. I am well aware who you both are. I know of your feats and impressive achievements. H21 spoke of you with admiration. So I can count on you for a delicate mission that must be carried out tonight. I cannot conceal the danger of the mission from heroes such as yourselves. But if it is a success, it could render our fatherland, Germany, an inestimable service. The task is to destroy, one by one and as quickly as possible, these French factories that work to defend France. Their distance from the front and their surveillance have made them invulnerable till now. Here. Look closely. The red dots mark the locations of the filling factories and the blue dots, those of the gunpowder factories. This blue dot must be blown up tonight and is the gunpowder factory of Saint-Médard-en-Jalles, in Gironde. Pedro, here, will drive you in a car to the little house on the cliff. Walk one kilometer along the beach to find the cove where a submarine awaits. In the third cove. This submarine will drop you at a corner of the French coast, exactly here. - Keep the map. - Thank you. You will return to the submarine before dawn, which will take you to the cove, and we will do this again soon, I hope. Where are the explosives? Here. Hard-boiled eggs? Like for a p... picnic. These bombs look and, crucially, weigh the same as an egg. I'm putting them in this bag, where we have already prepared a cold meal for you. These bombs are filled with an explosive that is very powerful. They are safe to carry. And in the unlikely scenario that you have to show your papers... - You have them? - Yes. ...they aren't compromising. And now, all that remains is for me to wish you luck. But, there is still a question to answer, sir. What question? - The question of money... - Oh, sorry... 100,000 marks for each factory at which you halt production by whatever means. It's a fixed price. - Okay? - Th... th... that's fine. - Until tomorrow. - Yes. Goodbye. - S... s... sir. - Good, let's go. We have time, only it's still completely dark. We can use that. The moon won't appear for half an hour. Let's go! This shack isn't very comfortable, but at least there is light. It's lucky it's not raining. Do you have everything? The maps? - The explosives? - It's all here. In that case I'll say goodbye. - It's only 00:55 a.m. - Don't worry, doctor. The submarine is due between one a.m. and two a.m. Please, sit down. No one ever comes this way. Is he dead? Yes. You aren't injured? I don't know. Our mission is over. We should be ourselves for the return journey. Don't you think? You're right. It's safer. - It's you? - André! You're alive! I can't believe it! I've come far and been through a lot. André! But how did you get here? Tell me! No, not now, let's go. Come on... I will only have 1200 francs per month. What does that matter? I will work too. André. Get down. Look. See there, on the sea? The submarine is surfacing. It's ours. Shall we get closer? Here's their supply base. Now we know the spot. You have the map? Yes. They're waiting for us. The old guy must be annoyed. Two a.m. It's their loss. They must have been caught. Diving stations, engines forward at half-speed, submersion to 12 meters. Mr. von Falken. Yes? - You asked for me, my dear friend? - Yes. You said it was urgent. Where were you last night? Wherever I wanted to be. Any news? It's not your job to monitor me. Do I stick my nose into your love life? Falken. You failed. The two German agents were arrested by the French. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but last night, in person, I gave my instructions to the two agents in question. They were imposters. Who told you that? Madrid. I don't believe you. Those two agents were provided to me by H21. Yes, of course, you rely on that little Frenchwoman. Only, I do not let passion lead me astray, I stay loyal to H21. She is our best spy. She was. - Well, when she returns... - She's not coming back. Ah! You've abandonned her? If the French ever arrest her, I'll save her. I will do anything to save her. - She was a traitor. - That's not true! She inconvenienced you. But you'll be sorry. Without her, you will no longer know the glory that she brings. And the success that you owe entirely to her. Entirely. You're wrong, Falken. Today, in the Irish Sea... "LUSITANIA" SUNK BY A SUBMARINE - To victory! - To victory! I'm sorry for dampening such unanimous enthusiasm but I am concerned that this brilliant attack, which cost 118 lives on their side, may cause the Americans to side with the enemies of the fatherland? The Americans? All they care about is commerce. President Wilson expresses admirable ideas, determination, and speaks to the American people of their duty toward the democratic ideal. America is sending us men and materials. Forty eight transporters have left the Port of New York. When will they arrive? We're expecting 50,000 men. Will they turn up? Yes, General. German submarine activity off the coast of Gibraltar has doubled. There is a new model in the Mediterranean. I alerted you, thanks to intelligence from the woman that you made fun of. Me? - Us? - Yes. Us. You changed your tune when you heard of her success in saving the southwest factories. Now that's enough. You were right, my friend. Here is the base. The most important location. The submarines leave from here to torpedo the first transporters. - They won't leave. - Pardon? You will be told the day, the hour. They won't leave. It's going badly in Spain. The men are nervous. They are thwarting their own plans. Von Ludow is discrediting his own agents. Wait... Mata Hari has been arrested. Von Falken has been called back to Berlin. Do you have a copy of von Ludow's report? Yes, General. What do you have to add in your defense? I did my duty, General. It was bad luck... There is no such thing as bad luck, only mistakes. With America joining the war, Germany fighting the entire world, and so many of its best sons dying, there is no excuse for not succeeding. Major von Ludow, who you denounced to me, successfully destroyed the Villacoublay hangar. Tomorrow, he will succeed in torpedoing the American transporters. You, you were in charge of blowing up the gunpowder and filling factories. They were not destroyed. Do you know what comes next? General, I ask for your permission to say goodbye to my wife and son in Königsberg. We will inform them ourselves. I'm waiting. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. I will do as you have ordered. I will go and see the American transporters sink. And once the boats are underwater, I will return to you, I will cry "victory," and I will be your wife. Tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow. And if the boats carry on past the coast? If we are beaten? Come. There is enough for two. Me first? Don't be late. You have to cross the border before tonight. I want to kiss Marthe once more before I go. I was right not to tell you about her. Love is a wonderful thing but duty comes first. If Marthe isn't here in five minutes, you must go, my friend. My love! Thank goodness you came. Oh! Wait! I ran as fast as I could. So, tell me. So, I will be squadron commander, the seaplane in front. We will fly very low. Half dive. Engine 400 rpm. To the west. Send the dive command. All engines. Immersion to 20 m. Victory? Yes. The American transporters will pass by. What? The American transporters will pass by. The French planes sank your submarines. There are now just three large oil stains on the sea. I don't understand. I cried "victory," and you replied "yes." Yes, it's a victory for me. My little victory, and I hate you! You have been patiently deceived by a woman who gave you nothing, will never give you anything and hates you. That day when I held you at gunpoint, my finger trembled on the trigger. I thought I couldn't stop myself. And I laughed! I hate you! I hate you! Ah, I see that you don't believe me yet. You have lost everything. I hate you. Understand? So now you can speak German. Yes. And if I kill you? Kill me, you'll do me a favor. I have nothing now, no one. Go on. What are you waiting for? You shot my father, my mother. On September 14th, in the north, you don't remember? You don't recognize me now. Thanks to you, I am mourning all those I loved. All of them. So kill me then! What are you waiting for? - You're free to go. - Oh, no! No mercy, anything but that! Have your revenge! That's the game! I believed in the great adventure. You were nothing but a little spy like the others. That's all. It's for me, what I'm doing here. Go away. No. Fine. CITY OF SAINT-NAZAIRE Citizens, Soon, American troops will arrive. We must give them the warmest of welcomes. Cheer our allies, wave flags in their honor. We fight for the same ideal. LONG LIVE THE UNITED STATES THE ARMISTICE HAS BEEN SIGNED Don't push like that. The front row is for people in mourning. Sorry, madam. THE END Subtitle translation by: Charlotte Smith
