This programme contains very strong language and allegations of domestic violence that some viewers may find upsetting I just don't know what to make of this case. I seem to have spent half of my life listening to these two in courtrooms. What's hard to understand why someone that's supposed to love you could be that cruel. He just kicked me in the back. I don't know who to believe. It didn't happen. I don't know how much of it is true. They're two actors. You can really just feel how much of a psychopath this woman is! Jury deliberations are under way in the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard defamation trial. I've never been this nervous for a verdict before. That was a TikTok trial. Why are we all so fascinated with this case? Because they're famous? Because of the details? Think it's all of the above. Jury trials are supposed to focus on law and facts. The jury hears what made it in to evidence. I won't see him any more! You are such a baby! Grow the fuck up! You've got the wrong girl. What didn't the jury see? 45 documents were unsealed by Judge Penney. Good morning. This is so wild! What wasn't allowed during the course of this trial? Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may be seated. All right, your next witness. Your Honour, defendant calls Amber Heard. Just a reminder, Miss Heard, you're still under oath, OK? For sure. Thank you. Thank you. All right, your question? How have you suffered publicly? Objection, speculation. Overruled. I am harassed. Amber's a liar! Humiliated. I was just sitting there, on this, on this carpet, looking at the dirty carpet, wondering how I wound up on this carpet! Threatened. Every single day. People want to kill me. People want to put my baby in the microwave. They tell me that. What has it been like for you to listen to Miss Heard's testimony at this trial? It's... It's insane... ..to hear heinous accusations of violence, sexual violence, that she's attributed to me, that she's accused me of. This is horrible. This is painful. And this is humiliating for any human being to go through. And perhaps it's easy to forget that I'm a human being. Brutal, cruel, um... ..and all false. All false. I just want Johnny to leave me alone! Just want him to leave me alone. I just find the whole thing uncomfortable to watch. I haven't plugged in to it at all cos I just... I don't really want to see such intimate detail of something... Dirty laundry, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. It's like a movie. Yeah. It's really like a movie. And these are really serious allegations here, but it has become kind of dramatised, you know, before our very eyes. The jury has a very, very tough job here, trying to decide who the abuser is, who the victim is. I mean, it's really a wild trial here. It's not just about defamation any more. They really have a big, difficult job here. There is only one person to have ever witnessed Johnny be physically violent with Amber, and it's her little sister, Whitney Heard. Today we'll be digging into all the nitty gritty of the staircase incident with Johnny, Amber and her sister, Whitney. This happened about a week after the Australia incident. I believe that this is from what's been called the staircase incident. I woke up to Amber in my bedroom, saying, "Can you believe he's cheating on me?" I went down there to talk to him, and I can tell he's clearly drunk. I found his iPad open, he was texting someone. He was texting this woman, um, that he had had a sexual relationship with. I saw that he had gone to her house after we got married. Unbelievably painful. Unbelievably painful. Do you recall what Miss Heard was upset about at this time? I do not. I really don't. Amber and I are on the little mezzanine, the kitchen's down here and the mezzanine's up here, you know, he's calling her a fucking whore, a fucking cunt, a used-up trash bag, you know, whatever. They were saying horrible things to one another - she was calling him old and fat. He bolted up the stairs. Whitney, her sister, was there who, who stepped in the way. He comes up behind me, strikes me in the back, kind of just somewhere over here, he strikes me in the back, I hear Amber shout, "Don't hit my fucking sister!" Amber snuck in the... She reached, got the roundhouse in and nailed me on the cheekbone. By that time, Johnny had already grabbed Amber by the hair with one hand and was whacking her repeatedly in the face with the other as I was standing there. It is the only instance where a witness, Amber's sister, is claiming to have actually witnessed first-hand assault alleged against Johnny Depp. Grabbed Amber by the hair with one hand and was whacking her repeatedly in the face with the other. I don't hesitate, I don't wait, I just in my head instantly think of Kate Moss and the stairs. Amber Heard in her direct testimony mentioned Kate Moss. One interesting thing that's happened that now the internet's going crazy over is he turned and gave her, like, did a fist pump, right, to his co-counsel. There's a concept in trial law called opening the door, like, maybe there's something we both agree is irrelevant, but on my side of things it would help me and help my case, but I know I can't bring it up because the judge says it's irrelevant or it's too prejudicial or whatever. Don't say that. Kate Moss and the stairs. Johnny Depp picked up on it first, actually, he smiled, like, I can't believe she just said that, because it opened the door. Yeah. Kate Moss was not going to testify. This was a real pivotal moment because this allowed both Ben Chew and Camille Vasquez to say that there are no other victims here, right? You thought he was going to throw your sister down the stairs, like he had thrown Kate Moss down the stairs, right? He swung at Whitney, and I'd heard a rumour, a big rumour, about that. And so it's what I thought of. If Kate Moss were to come in and say, "No, Johnny was never physically abusive or anything "to me," then that would be a really big detrimental thing to Amber's case. The jurors are told, "It's your job to evaluate credibility," and, you know, if you find someone is lying on one issue, you can conclude they're liars in general. I know the truth about Johnny. The relationship between Johnny Depp and Kate Moss, a lot of people in the media back then, when they were dating, it was looked at as somewhat of a volatile relationship. Johnny Depp was arrested for trashing a hotel room. I believe in fairness. And justice. I believe in the truth. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Please be seated. Next witness. Good morning, Your Honour. Mr Depp calls Kate Moss to the stand. Thank you, Ma'am, if you could raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth under penalty of law? I do. Thank you. For how long, Miss Moss, were you and Mr Depp a romantic couple? '94 to 1998. What, if anything, happened when you were in Jamaica with Mr Depp? We were leaving the room and, as I left the room, I slid down the stairs and I hurt my back. Did Mr Depp push you in any way down the stairs? No. And during the course of your relationship, did he ever push you down any stairs? No, he never pushed me, kicked me or threw me down any stairs. Thank you, Miss Moss. Thank you very much. Thank you. These jurors are supposed to be listening to every single word of everything that's going on. The problem is they might stop listening to you because at that moment they no longer find you credible. That moment was very damaging for Amber Heard. Don't know what the jury is thinking but, if it's a credibility game, which it is, they may have tuned out to the rest of her case. ..Was whacking her repeatedly in the face with the other. Because of that very moment. This case rests on the sentence, the first sentence, of that article. Yeah. "I became the face of domestic violence", and the case really is... The worst case is, "We're going to prove that everything you've said "is not true." All right, your next witness. "You're making this stuff up." Could you state your full name for the record? Shannon Curry. What do you do for a living? I am a clinical and forensic psychologist. How did you get involved in this case? I was asked by Counsel for Mr Depp to provide a psychological evaluation of Miss Heard. Were you ever asked to do a psychological evaluation of Mr Depp? No. During this trial, both sides have been using mental health and substance addiction as weapons against the other team, and what usually happens is the people bringing the case usually have a mental health expert diagnosing the opposing person with a bad mental health disorder. The results of Miss Heard's evaluation supported two diagnoses - borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. And then the person defending themselves in the trial will typically try to say, no, no, no, I don't have that bad diagnosis, I have something that evokes more pity from a jury and an audience, something like PTSD. OK, so I met with Miss Heard for a total of about 29 hours. The main opinion is that Miss Heard's report of intimate partner violence is consistent with what we know in the field about intimate partner violence and that Miss Heard demonstrated very clear psychological and traumatic effects. And did you arrive at any diagnostic conclusions? I diagnosed Miss Heard with post-traumatic stress disorder. Miss Heard did not have PTSD, and there were also pretty significant indications that she was grossly exaggerating symptoms of PTSD. We know that, if somebody suffers childhood abuse as a child, they're much more likely then to be more vulnerable to getting PTSD. She was raised in a family of violence - she was physically abused by her father, she saw her father abuse her mother, and both her parents also struggled with substance abuse very significantly. So she had learned from a very early age how to caretake. When it comes to histrionic, a lot of the key features are going to be drama, extreme discomfort with not being the centre of attention, extreme efforts to be the centre of attention, and, when they feel that they're not the centre of attention, you will see making up stories to try to get attention, often taking on a victim or princess role. She learned that she could love someone who hurts her. She knew that people who hurt her also can love her. It also represented the quick shifts you'll see between emotions, so she would suddenly be one way and then she would become very animated. People who are observing them will feel like it's almost playacting. It became about whether people thought she was lying, how Heard was acting on the stand. She looked shifty. As it sort of snowballed out of control, it became much, much, much, much less about an actual simple yes/no question. Can she call herself a victim of domestic abuse? Let's go back to... ..there was a plane incident where Depp allegedly kicked Amber Heard on a plane, I believe it was in 2014. Just going back to the incident where Depp and Heard got in a fight on an airplane. So I'm going to take you to the Boston plane incident. The plan, we'd go back to LA for his daughter's birthday, and I get on the plane and I, um... I just knew in every cell of my body something was wrong. You just boil it down to that one incident, all the little details, like, don't really have anything to do with proving whether a crime happened, but the goal is to prove that she's lying. Good morning, Mr Wyatt. Morning. Mr Wyatt, was Mr Depp consuming any alcohol on that flight? Sure, yes. Did he seem intoxicated? Seem intoxicated? No, he seemed like Johnny. No, he seemed normal. He reeks of weed and alcohol. I mean, his breath smelled so bad. Well, she was giving Johnny the cold shoulder, being quiet and, you know, seemed pouty. We had argued the night before. She was looking for a fight, and I had taken two of these... ..opiates, these Roxycodones. He was mad at me for taking the job with James Franco. James and Amber! He hated James Franco. So he, um, is asking me about how the sex scene went to asking me what James Franco had done in the scene. He was saying really disgusting things - about my body, about how I liked it. He called me a slut in front of people. To what extent were you able to see Mr Depp and Miss Heard? Er, it... I was able to see them very clearly. Wasn't Mr Depp saying pretty horrible things to Miss Heard? I don't recall that. Like, "Get fucked on set. "Get fucked with fucking James fucking Franco." Did you hear that? I don't recall. Did you hear him say at least, "You fucking liked it"? No. Did you hear him say, "I bet you slipped the tongue in there "and you liked it"? No. Did you hear him say, make references to Amber's pussy and asking her if her pussy was wet? Your Honour, lack of foundation, harassment. We'll get... Did you hear any of that? No, not that I recall. Overrule the objection. I, at some point in this, get up, I walk away from him, my back is turned to him, and I feel this boot in my back. He just kicked me in the back. I didn't... I thought to myself, I don't know what to do. No-one said anything, no-one did anything, it was like you could... ..you could hear a pin drop on that plane. You could feel the tension, but no-one did anything. Felt so embarrassed that he could kick me to the ground in front of people. To what extent, if any, did you observe Mr Depp or Miss Heard hit, kick or throw anything at each other on the plane? No. I don't recall that at all. As he got worse, he demanded the oxygen tank from the flight attendant. You shared an oxygen tank with Mr Depp on that Boston plane, didn't you? No. He continued to drink and then, eventually, um, started howling like an animal and passed out in the bathroom. With the door locked. Mr Wyatt, did you see Mr Depp go to the back of the plane and pass out and moan loudly? I don't recall that. You don't recall that either? No. OK. Did you leave the plane with Mr Depp? I went to my own home. OK. And what was Mr Depp's state? I don't recall. You don't recall if he was passed out or not? No. As you're sitting here today under oath, you honestly can't remember if Mr Depp was passed out? I don't know. And Mr Depp could have kicked Amber on that plane, right? Not that I saw. When you got off the plane from Boston, you knew Miss Heard was angry with you, didn't you? She was always angry, yes. And you asked Mr Deuters, he was your personal... Mr Deuters was your personal assistant, correct? Yeah, Mr Deuters was one of them, yes, sir. Right, and it wasn't uncommon for you to ask Mr Deuters to communicate with Miss Heard on your behalf, correct? It wasn't uncommon for any of them to communicate with Miss Heard on my behalf. Deuters never testified so, with Depp on the witness stand for the second time, here's what happened when Amber Heard's defence attorney tried to show texts from Depp's assistant to the jury. Can you pull up exhibit 229, please? Based on Mr Depp's testimony, I'd ask for the admission of exhibit 229. Your Honour, can we please approach? Sure. Some people are saying in the chat, the Deuters text, if that's what we're about to see, they're not going to look good for Johnny. Came up in the UK trial as well, um, about kicking... something about kicking Amber. They didn't get that Deuters stuff in. OK. After that side bar, attorney Ben Rottenborn moves on and those texts stay out of evidence. Why would you want to exclude evidence? Because it hurts you, that's why. Depp is a master actor, dude. He seduced all of us by barely moving. It's your decision whether you want to separate the art from the artist. Erm, I think Johnny Depp is a terrific actor, I also happen to think he's a violent lover. He's a likeable guy, other than these horrific allegations, right? Everybody loved him in The Pirates Of The Caribbean, and there's a little bit of what's called a halo effect around him. But that's why these photos, the texts, the testimony is so devastating cos it shatters that perception we have of Mr Depp. Paul Bettany's a good friend that you've done drugs with, right? That's a strange question. Erm, Paul Bettany's a good friend, yes. The two of you shared an enjoyment of controlled drugs and alcohol at that time. Yes, or no? Yes. You've done drugs with him? Yes, I have. Cocaine, right? Er, cocaine, yes. Alcohol? Alcohol, yes. Now you try to conduct yourself as a gentleman, right? Yes, sir. Mr Depp, this is a text message exchange that you had with Paul Bettany on June 11th, 2013. You text Mr Bettany, "Let's burn Amber!" Do you see that? I do see that. The next text down, you say, "Let's drown her before we burn her! "I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards "to make sure she is dead." Did I read that right? You certainly did, yes. And you wrote that about the woman who would later become your wife. Yes, I did. Dark humour. The text messages that... I apologise that everyone's had to experience, I am ashamed of... of some of the references made, I'm...embarrassed that at the time, the heat of the moment, the heat of the pain, um, that I was feeling, um, went to...went to dark places. All right, thank you, you may be seated. All right, closing arguments, Mr Rottenborn. OK, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Think about the message that Mr Depp and his attorneys are sending to Amber, and, by extension, to every victim of domestic abuse everywhere. When Mr Depp brought this case for defamation, Miss Heard went all-in. She spun a story of shocking, overwhelming, brutal abuse. If you didn't take pictures, it didn't happen. If you did take pictures, they're fake. She came in to this courtroom prepared to give the performance of her life, and she gave it. You didn't seek medical treatment, you weren't injured. If you did seek medical treatment, you're crazy. Now it's time for you, the jury, to come to a decision. This trial is about so much more than Johnny Depp versus Amber Heard. What is at stake in this trial is a man's good name. It's about the freedom of speech, stand up for it, protect it. What is at stake at this trial is a man's life. And reject Mr Depp's claims against Amber. The life that he lost when he was accused of a heinous crime. He doesn't stop there, because in Mr Depp's world you don't leave Mr Depp. And the life he could live when he was finally vindicated. And if you do, he will start a campaign of global humiliation against you. The mountain of evidence that Mr Depp abused Miss Heard is simply not there. A smear campaign that lasts to this very day. Either he hit her countless times or you can't believe a single word that comes out of her mouth. He will do everything he can to destroy your life, to destroy your career. All right. It is out of my hands. So just a reminder that you're not to read anything about this case, you're not to watch anything about this case, you're not to listen to anything about this case. This applies to television, newspapers, magazines, the internet and any online sites. Further, you're not to read, watch or listen to anything about the case on social media internet sites. Er, any blogs or similar sites. In addition you must not communicate with anyone about the case... Tonight, with his high-profile defamation case now in the hands of the jury, Johnny Depp is letting his hair down - the actor spotted performing onstage in England after explosive closing arguments Friday. Dear Johnny Depp, I stand with you. I stand with you. On TikTok the ..now has nearly 20 billion views, while the #JUSTICEFORAMBERHEARD has 77.5 million. # Well, I do # I'm a member, leave it cold like December, yeah... # Jury's been dismissed for the weekend, so that's it, now we have a long weekend and wait until Tuesday. What are we going to do? Guys, is anyone else freaking out? We have to wait an entire weekend to see what's going on in this case. Sorry for shaking the camera, but I am stressed, I'm not gonna be able to relax now, I'm going to be thinking about this all weekend, I am freaking out. "How long is this going to take?" If you think about it right now, Johnny Depp in the public is about as radioactive as Chernobyl soil. And there is a real risk that not only could he lose this case as the plaintiff, but there's a $100 million counterclaim against him, so this thing could get real bad, even worse, real fast for Mr Depp. I thought it was important to come out because she didn't really have any supporters out here. I think especially today I'm the only one out here. Man, my heart is racing. It is literally like...boof! I've never been this nervous for a verdict before. So we've got literally five minutes, so, guys, which way is it going to do? I've asked you and on the poll, it's gone up to 74% of you think that Johnny will win, with neither being the next choice. So you're in court now, whatever else is going on in your life it's like, "I'm sorry, court has resumed." Oh, here's the barn witch, here she is. Oh, shit, oh, shit! She looks so happy, oh, I can't wait to see that smile turn upside down. Fingers crossed. Fingers crossed. Yeah, Amber Heard is the only one in court, Johnny Depp is currently in the UK. He's not at the courtroom, she's gone to the courtroom, Amber Heard, and is apparently... Her people are already saying "Well, doesn't this say it all?" We're ready for the jury. He's gallivanting on a rock concert over there. They look pretty stoic. What do you guys think in the chat? I wonder who the jury's looking at. All right, Mr Foreperson, is this the verdict of the jury? Yes, Your Honour. All right, is it unanimous? Yes, Your Honour. All right. Let's see it. In civil case number CL20192911... I got my mega pint ready. Oh, my God. ..Mr Depp's claim against Miss Heard... Here we go. One, as to the statement... Here we go. ..appearing in the online op-ed entitled Amber Heard: I Spoke Up Against Sexual Violence... Statement one, the headline. ..And Faced Our Culture's Wrath, do you find that Mr Depp has proven all the elements of defamation? Answer - yes. Damn! Depp's wins count one. ..the greater weight of the evidence... Oh, shit! ..the statement was made or published by Miss Heard. Wow! The answer - yes. Oh! Oh! The statement was about Mr Depp, answer - yes. Question - the statement was false. Answer - yes. Yes! He's winning! The statement has a defamatory implication about Mr Depp. Answer - yes. It's gone Johnny's way. Do you find that Mr Depp has proven all the elements... Very interesting this one. ..of defamation? Answer - yes. Ho-ho-ho-ho! The defamatory implication was designed and intended by Miss Heard. Answer - yes. Question - do you find that Mr Depp has proven all the elements of defamation? Answer - yes. ..greater weight of the evidence. Question - the defamatory implication... Oh, my God. ..was designed and intended by Miss Heard? Answer - yes. All yeses. Holy shit. ..we the jury award compensatory damages in the amount of $10 million. $10 million! ..we the jury award punitive damages in the amount of $5 million. Oh-ho-ho! Yes! Oh, my God. Do you find that Miss Heard has proven all the elements of defamation? Answer - yes. Oh. Oh. She wins one count in her counterclaim. As against John C Depp II, we the jury award compensatory damages in the amount of $2 million. Oh, my God. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes jury service in this case. I want to thank you again for your dedication and your hard work during this trial... Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny Depp and Amber Heard defamation trial announced its verdict, ruling in favour of Johnny Depp. We love you, Johnny. We love... Oi, John... Johnny... Johnny, Johnny, I love you bro, I love you bro. A verdict of little victory when the battle has been so brutal. Amber Heard was not a good witness and juries react to that. I think the jury got it wrong. I'm very disappointed in the jury verdict. I think this was another big win for powerful men and it's a colossal loss for women. This was a humiliation ritual intending to put women in their place. If you speak out about abuse, there will be consequences. It was verdict we all wanted, guys. # Johnny Depp, Depp, Depp # Johnny Depp, Depp... # Johnny, Johnny, Depp, Depp, Depp # Johnny Depp, Depp, Johnny Depp... I've never had as many emails as I've received about this very topic, I've heard from men who have been abused, I've heard from women who are survivors who don't believe Amber Heard and say she's hurting survivors, so there's a lot of feelings out there. When it's somebody that we know, somebody that we maybe like, they don't want to have to think this person is really capable of doing what's alleged in court. This powerful open letter states that they don't stand with her. They don't accept that she is who she claimed to be. "We will not stand with you. "No victim of domestic violence acts in the manner in which you do." We supported you, we worked for you, we rallied behind you, and you betrayed us all. Listening to you has been torturously painful, triggering and unbearable for many. I'm feeling incredibly triggered and retraumatised as someone who's experienced relationship abuse in the past, but I'm not feeling triggered on behalf of Johnny Depp. What we're seeing happen, stereotypes that are coming out, right, that are calling Amber Heard a liar, glorifying Johnny Depp as this amazing man, right, erm, is the reason why MeToo started, it's the... It's why activists really wanted to fight for this movement and why it's so important, because women didn't feel... And... And, you know, survivors of all genders didn't feel like they could report, didn't feel like it was going to be welcomed. What does it mean for that? Are we at the end of MeToo? Is this a reversal? Where are we? I mean, it's a backlash to MeToo, and what we're seeing unfold on the internet is that we're proving them right, we're saying that, "Yes, you will be silenced, "you will be humiliated." I am not taking any sides, it sounds like Heard did allegedly do some pretty malicious shit during the course of their relationship. But I am feeling some kind of way about the way that Heard is being inhumanely attacked every day on a global scale. And here's what this means for victims of abuse, fewer victims will come forward, especially if they haven't been perfect during the course of their relationship with the abuser. So if you're not the perfect victim because you did something wrong, you fought back, you were an imperfect person, then the world will lob every available insult at you to get you to shut up. First question, how is Amber doing? One of the first things she said is, "I am so sorry to all those women out there, "this is a setback for all women in and outside the courtroom." Let me ask you about social media. It was incredibly lopsided and vitriolic against Amber Heard. Do you think that had an effect on the case? Absolutely. Do you think jurors were aware of it? How can you not? They went home every night, they have families, the families are on social media. Do you believe the jurors saw any of that, were swayed by any of that? No, I don't think there's any reason to believe that the jurors violated their oath. Had a ten day break in the middle because of the judicial conference, there's no way they couldn't have been influenced by it, and it was horrible. It is everywhere but, at the same time, they were admonished every single night, and they had a tremendous amount of respect, I think, for the court and the process, and they were doing the best that they could. I was against cameras in the courtroom, and I went on record with that and had argued against it because of the sensitive nature of this, but it made it a zoo. By allowing cameras into the trial you opened up the space for a TikTok meme, I mean, you did have obviously, like, competing social media hashtags, right, in support for one or the other but there was a lot of research showing that the hashtags for Johnny Depp had been essentially created and proliferated and manipulated far and wide across the internet. People say it's bots. The scale of, like, the misinformation about this trial is truly unprecedented. OK, I'm watching this interview with Amber Heard's lawyer, she's very articulate, by the way, which is completely in contrast to the way that she was portrayed on social media, and so naturally go to check out the comments and they're all very disparaging. They're racking up tonnes of likes, 16,000, 25,000, 33,000 but when you actually go to click in to these profiles, they're all fake, like, none of these people are real. Zero content. And then you start to realise, like, these are probably bots and when you actually click on the profile of the person who posted this video, it's a super-pro Johnny Depp fan account which is probably a bot, too. We're being influenced by bots interacting with bots interacting with bots. Do you know anything about an online campaign, on behalf of Johnny Depp? That was absolutely absurd and baseless. And you know for a fact that neither he nor his agents or anyone tried to, in some way, pay for or otherwise encourage this kind of social media activities? Categorically false. Categorically. Categorically false. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yes! Well, I got to thank you. No. I've been through a similar thing and I'm just so proud of you. I'm so proud of you, you didn't give up. You helped make sure people heard the truth. Guys, I met Johnny Depp, I'm not just saying I shook his hand, I spent time, quality time, with Johnny Depp. This is the case that, though there is a verdict, just will not end. Why? Because Amber Heard has not stopped talking about this case. She sat down for an exclusive interview with Savannah Guthrie. Even if you think that I'm lying, you still couldn't look me in the eye and tell me that you think on social media there's been a fair representation. Yeah, because you lied, and the public didn't buy... Isn't falling for your nonsense any more. And the jury is not immune to that. Do you think the jury saw it? How could they not? I think even the most well-intentioned juror, it would've been impossible to avoid this. Thank you, a lot of survivors want to thank you and thank you for everything, man. Incredible. There's an abundance of people who also agree and think that you're lying, that we all are angry at you. The Depp team argued that you were the abuser. I never had to instigate it, I responded to it. When you're... "I never had to instigate it." She believes every word she's saying. Nice spin there. Then there are other times, there's another tape where you're taunting him and saying, "Oh, tell the world, Johnny Depp, "'I, a man, am a victim of domestic violence.'" 20 second clips, so there are transcripts of them... Yeah. ..are not representative of two hours or the three hours those clips are excerpt from. What? What do you mean, doesn't represent it? What do you mean by that? Yeah, it does cos it's in... It's in the recording, you can't sit there and say, "Well, it doesn't represent the whole..." It does. Amber Heard wanted to characterise Johnny Depp as a character. There were many memes from the trial but now memes from the... Now memes from the interview. The Depp lawyer said... Called your testimony the performance of a lifetime, and said you were acting, what do you say to that? Says the lawyer for the man... You mean to tell me that that fool was lying to us the whole time? His hands were not really made of scissors? What we really want to get into right now is what the jury didn't see, what wasn't allowed during the course of this trial. Over 6,000 documents have been unsealed in this case. This would've been very relevant for the jury to hear. If you wanted to get hold of those documents, you had to go to the Virginia Courthouse... Andrea Burkhart, who is a YouTube commentator and is a criminal defence attorney, she crowd sourced the funds in order to buy these documents. If you've been watching this case for a while, you know that Amber Heard has a habit of hiding behind information that can't be verified, but it looks like that might not be the case. What spurred this was when they were in court to sign the judgment in sentence, Judge Azcarate voiced her intention to unseal materials that had previously been sealed, and she said that many of the things were sealed because we didn't want to have any taint to the jury. So if Amber Heard was hoping to keep all of this stuff secret, I think she's going to find herself out of luck. Let's go back to the... There was a plane incident where Depp allegedly kicked Amber Heard on a plane, I believe it was in 2014. Did you observe Mr Depp kick or throw anything at each other on the plane? No. I don't recall that at all. There were texts from Johnny Depp's assistant, Stephen Deuters, to Amber Heard, quote... Why were these text messages not introduced? I mean, this felt very pivotal for Amber Heard's case. The court ruled on those that they're irrelevant to the case at hand of defamation, you know, there was so much evidence in this case, and now we're seeing even more evidence. In the pre-trial hearings they have to, you know, rule what is admissible, what isn't, and there are some of these things that are really on the line of whether they should or shouldn't have been admissible. We're going to dive into all of these things today. Strangely, the texts produced by Miss Heard are in a different format than all other texts she produced. The voracity of these text messages is critical and subject to serious question. So what is the truth? This question of the truth of the matter I can't answer. In fact, no-one can. No-one knows what happened between these two people. Sounds like there is evidence that they were both abusive toward each other, but it's a lot of "he said, she said" and it's nearly impossible to find resolution and truth. The public is a second jury, us making up our own decisions and really swayed on people's public opinion, including the jurors, of these two characters. People who've been accused of wrongdoing, the goal is to get a form of justice, a sense of redemption for themselves, it's about clearing their name and trying to establish what the truth was of this relationship or this incident in a public court of law. He's won already in the court of opinion. And he needed the court process to clear his name. The thing is, about justice, is that it's not about the truth, it's not about right or wrong, it's about what the judge or jury believes. We now live in a time where we don't necessarily believe who's right, we believe who we like the most. Because of who they are. The outcome of this trial will have ramifications, if nothing else, how people believe people in their stories. Subtitles by Red Bee Media
