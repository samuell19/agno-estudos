The accused, a.k.a. Benedito Emtabaj? da Silva... is a mischief-maker well known to the police. He frequents the district of Lapa and its vicinities. He is a passive pederast, who shaves his eyebrows... and imitates women, even changing his own voice. He has no religion. He smokes, gambles and is addicted to alcohol. He has no education. He speaks crudely, in the language of the gutter. He is of little intelligence. He hates society, which rejects him because of his vices... and associates with pederasts, whores... procurers and other misfits. He boasts about his wealth but has no regular work. His money can come only from degenerate criminal activities. He has numerous prior convictions. When in custody, he is often disruptive... and attacks police officers. He is cunning, an habitual law-breaker. For all these reasons, he poses a great threat to society. Rio de Janeiro, capital city... May 12, 1932. "In Arabia, there lived a handsome but cruel Sultan. Every night he married a virgin whom he slew before morning. To put an end to this cruelty, the lovely Sheherazade... a virgin of rare beauty and sultry perfume... offered herself in marriage to the young tyrant. Rousing his curiosity and desire... Sheherazade spun... tales of adventure and love. Day by day she put off... her death. After 10O1 nights... the Sultan finally... yielded to her lures. " THE LUX CABARET PRESENTS VIT?RIA DOS ANJOS How are you? I wasn't expecting anyone. Looking for some fun? - Piss off. - I wouldn't pay you anyway. $400 for the two of you. - Hello. - Hello. Good night. Be careful. BLUE DANUBE BAR AND RESTAURANT Six. Seven. Ten! Two! - Hi, Gentlemen. - Nine. - Now my luck's going to change. - Your rabbit's foot's thirsty. How was the show today? Pretty? Classy, as always. - Six. - Seven! Throw, Taboo. See what you can do. You know I don't like to gamble, Laurita. Swear to me That you love me And I will return But if you love falsely Your love I will spurn Do you know that beauty? That thief dated a girlfriend of mine. - Don't mix with him. - Of course I will. He looks like trouble. Jo?o! Has anyone ever told you you look like an Indian prince? No man who surrenders to this sinful drug... Satan's dust, can ever satisfy a woman. What a beautiful sermon! What's beautiful is this flask I'm taking from your pocket. What the hell! Come on. I told you, I'm done for the night. When was a hooker ever done for the night? Dance with me, Jo?o. Come here. Please, sir, let's keep it peaceful in here. You can sit on my prick, baby. Excuse me! Who does he think he is, grabbing me like that? What a vicious man! I hate violence. To hell with this guy! - You! Come with me. - I'm not going anywhere! Let me go! - Let me go! - No woman turns me down, lady! Quit it, Jo?o! Quit it! Take a hike, pig! What is this? What?! A big man like you needs a piece? Get out of here! Beat it! Get lost, asshole! I'm no stray dog, fatso! Fatso! - You OK? - Yes. Show's over. Show's over, come on. I kicked that fat pig's ass for you. For your beautiful pearly eyes. I'm forever sweeping up dust, this house is always dirty! The floor's filthy, Laurita. Clean this pigsty up. - Have you fixed Victoria's dress? - Yes. - Are Amador's towels washed? - All of them. - How about madam's dress? - I already washed it. - Did you dry it? - My name isn't sun. Sun-of-a-bitch! And your ass... You get it stuffed today? Not today. Yesterday... - Lord, what a filthy mouth! - Shut up and sort the rice. Put the beans on, madam. I'm going to check on the baby. It's soup time. Doesn't it hurt when you comb your hair like that? Sure, but it's worth it. Looks beautiful, soft as silk. I've been doing the same show for two years now. But it's superb! When you say... "In Arabia, there lived a handsome but cruel Sultan... every night he wedded... " It's time to stop. Enough. The public wants something new. You should do a show about China. As if you'd know where China is? China is a wonderful place. It's at the other end of the world. There, everything is upside down. A Negro here is white there. Daytime here is night there. And people sleep with open eyes, and wake up with closed eyes. That's the stupidest thing I ever heard! Greg?rio... Maybe you could pay me tomorrow? I've been working here for two months. Drop by the office. Tomorrow. You said that last month. Don't get all worked up, pal. - Let's go? - Yes. No one has a better footwork than you. Why are you shadowing me? - What do you want, wild pussycat? - I want to fight like you. So? My name is Renato. - You look more like a Renatinho. - Renato. I told you. - I want to fight like you. - Don't bother me, wild cat. - You could teach me. - Cut the bullshit! I learn fast. So... You going to teach me? Get out of here. I'd like you to stay, but I can't mess with you, my Indian prince. Are you sleepy? What's going on? Hands off! A real man uses his fists. Silence wraps us Like a dream Moonlight sheds A silver beam You sleep on And listen not To the song Our love begot Moonlight Sheds a silver beam Moonlight wake my lover Who with my kisses I will smother Please, my angel... The bell tolls and the night cries. Fly, fly away! Please, fly away! Leave this depraved, stinking world. - Stop it. - Go, quickly now. Go! That's the last time you flog your ass around here, Taboo. What if the baby had woken up? And with a fucking cop! I was just with my angel of goodness. Since when was a cop an angel of goodness, Taboo? And the dough? Where is it? $500? - Where's the rest? - That's all he had. You're doing charity work for the cops now, Taboo? Do I have to remind you that you owe me a fortune? It was all he had. If it was all he had, you will stay with a sore ass and empty pockets. It's my problem if my hole is itching and sore. Did you come at least? Yes, I came. Look at the mermaid! Hi, guys! Kiss your aunt, come. In Arabia, there lived a handsome but cruel Sultan. Every night he married a virgin... whom he screwed before morning. To put an end to this crudity, the lovely Sharazade... a virgin of rare beauty and salty perfume... What are you doing? - Take my clothes off, now! - I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I love this number. - Take them off! - I lost my head... I know all the words to the song. Stop singing! "Lost my head"! Who do you think you are? You turn up late, dress up in my clothes and make fun of me. It's insane! I'm sorry. I, myself, promise it won't happen again. Don't trust that nigger, they said. He's crazier than a mad dog. Quick. I'm in a hurry. Shut the door! Move! My clothes stink now! Idiot! You tear my costume, pinch me... - The nigger's gone crazy! - No, madam, he hasn't. What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't treat me like this, do you hear? I'll slash your face! Ugly cow! You've got no right to treat me this way! You treat me like this for nothing! I'll mess up your scabby face! I want to settle up. I'm leaving and I want my pay! - And when did I fire you? - I fired myself. Then go. Go! No, you son-of-a-bitch. - Who do you think I am? - I'm not going until I get paid! Who do you think you're talking to? Here. Shoot! - What? - Shoot, you son-of-a-bitch! Stop shaking her. She'll be sick all over you. Look at her hair. I'm going to wash out the lice. It's disgusting! This is no way to raise a child. - Stop nagging, what's the matter? - When did you last wash her ears? - What are you going to do now? - I'm going to go really wild. - You've always been wild... - See? You should be up on the stage. A celebrity, adored by the crowd. It's no use trying to talk me into it. I've spoken to myself and I'm giving up being an artiste. I'm tired of fighting. I was born an outlaw, that's how I'll live! Candy! Wonderful candy! Want some? I'm going for a walk. Jo?o? Taboo's gone out. I'd like you to meet Alvaro. Alvaro, this is Benedito. Good evening... Benedito. Benedito is a good friend of mine. Maybe he knows where to find the kind of girl you like. What's she like, this girl he's looking for? You know, a girl... Dark skin... big lips... You know, kind of bad. Are you a fan of Josephine Baker? I am a son of Iansan and Ogun. Of La Baker, I'm a disciple. Sit down. Sit down! You want a dark girl, my height? Yes. I have a sister you'd like. Want to meet her? What's her name? Josefa. She's got big thighs... hungry lips. She's real bad, my sister. And she's got... Big thighs, you said? Yes. You can feel them, my sister's thighs. Feel them. Grab it. That perfume smells good. - Must have cost a packet. - Yeah. Easy... Josefa. That's it. Take it off. Yeah, take it off. That's good. My red-hot mama... Damien! - Let me in! Let me in! - What is it, Fatima? The police, they are busting into every joint in Lapa! They're looking for a killer! I'm scared. They're going to break in here! Take it easy, Fatima. Nothing's happened. No one's coming here. Alvaro is our witness. We haven't done anything. Right, Alvaro? Where are you going, Alvaro? - I've got to go. - Don't go, Alvaro! Alvaro, stay here! Take care of Fatima while I get her some water. I'll be back in no time. Oh, Alvaro... Fatima! Fatima! Fatima! Fatima! The cops! How much? Ten thousand! And he couldn't buy me a drink! - Tight bastard! - He had a fat wallet. Must be payday. Give me. He was pretty classy. Take it. Here's two hundred. Two hundred? Can't you spare any more? I'm sick of your whining voice. I'm tired. You make me want to puke. If you're not happy, blow! Take it. You limp fairy. You're like a viper, slithering through the night, scaring people. Come. Sit down. You also want a girl? My height, dark-skinned? Feel Mama's thighs. A MOTHER'S LOVE You said you had "A Mother's Love" written here? Yeah. The most beautiful thing in the world. A mother's love. And you? Ever been in love? What's up, Jo?o? Don't you know who I am? Yes, I think so. - You think I'm a sucker? - You're picking a fight? Think you can rob me and sneak out with that cute face of yours? Rob you? Scum... I may be ignorant, but I, myself, am not blind! I'm used to sleeping with crooks. You just had to ask, and I'd give you much more. Now I'm gonna vaccinate you. Judas... so you'll learn... Get out! Get out! Laurita... Laurita, I want to tell you something. Yes... - Take it. - Last night... Laurita, I had this dream... I dreamt... Stop it! I dreamt that Ferreirinha rode up on a white horse... to give me... - Where you going, all dressed up? - Not I. We! - We're going to the High Life. - What High Life? The High Life Club, moron! What do you think I meant? - You think they'll let us in? - Of course! No more nights at the Danube, the small glasses of wine... I want to be a star! - Can I come too? - Are you ready? - If you change out of that get up. - Jo?o, what about me? Go change, too. You look like a tramp. Come on! - How about this? - Perfect. Now watch me. Come on! When I die... I want no one to cry... I want a yellow ribbon... with her name write on. When I die I want no one to cry I want a yellow ribbon With her name write on When I die I want no one to cry - I want a yellow ribbon - Get down, Jo?o! With her name write on If there is an after-life And the soul goes on living I want a dark-skinned girl To tap-dance on my coffin When I die, when I die Shut up! Are you crazy? Junkie! The baby's asleep! - Are we going out or aren't we? - Shut up, cunt! I put on this show for you... and you're fooling around! Your hair is so beautiful. - Swell. - You think so? Just like a wig! It's gorgeous... Don't mess up my necklaces. I'm going up, up, up! Shit! - Look how beautiful I am! - Very chic! And my shoes? Lovely, aren't they? - Good evening. - Good evening. We'd like to go in. It's not possible. I can't let you in. Please don't block the entrance. - Why? - Excuse us. - Why can't we go in? - Because you can't, that's why. Why not? Because hookers and bums aren't allowed. - You see "bum" written here? - I don't want trouble. I don't owe you anything! I pay back my debts. In my house, God provides. If not, the Virgin helps out. - Let's go! - No, I'm going in... - Let me go! - Get off! Ouch, she bit me! Let me go, you bastard! Let's go, Jo?o! Quit it, let's go! Let's go, Jo?o! You should leave me alone. I'm not going anywhere. Not until you calm down. Calm down, Jo?o! Let me take care of that. Look, I got hurt too! You should have run off, like the fairy. - Did you have to go that far? - Sure I did. I won't take that shit! Why can't I go in like anybody else? Because you're not like anybody else. - I'm going out. - Lf it's to the hospital, fine. Watch your mouth or you'll be sorry, bitch! Do you need anything? Ointment or something? Excuse me. You're like a wild animal! Banging your head against the wall. I want to straighten myself out. Straighten out? You were born bent. Remember when we first met? When I first came to Rio? Where's the man who gave me a home, fed me... cared for my kid? Where is he? Right here, in front of you. - Do you still think I'm pretty? - Don't start, Laurita. Say it. I want to hear it. - Am I pretty? - Yes. Very pretty? You're beautiful, Laurita. Why don't you calm down? There's something eating me up inside. - What is it? - I don't know. What's eating you? Rage... It's like you're angry just for being alive. Maybe you're right. But the anger will pass. Mine just seems to grow. An anger without an end... which I can't explain. Laurita... what do you see in me that I can't see? I see... Rudolph Valentino... Johnny Weismuller... Gary Cooper. Look... - Here. - See how smart she is? What? You want a toffee apple? Take it. Hold it. Careful with the apple... My princess is so cute! Look in the closet. Mr. Jo?o Francisco... I have a complaint drawn up against you. For theft. This is my home, where I live with my family. If anyone claims they've been robbed here, they're lying. I know what goes on in this thieves' nest. But you are accused of stealing the takings of the Cabaret Lux... situated at 38, Pharmacy Street... next to 11 November Place. I worked there! I was paid what they owed me! That's not what Mr. Greg?rio and Miss Vit?ria declared. Mr. Greg?rio Albuquerque Freitas... and Miss Vit?ria Aparecida Ximenes dos Santos Cruz. The owners. Sir, I was paid what I was owed. As Saint George is my witness, I stole nothing. - We're taking you in. - I'm sorry, but I won't go. Unfortunately, you have no choice. I may be a nobody, worth less than a dog... but you're not taking me in for something I didn't do. Calm down! Stop it! Stop it! Get him! Black bastard! - Who is it? - It's me. Let me in! How many cops with you? None... Let me in. Who told you where I was? Laurita. And she gave you the lousy idea of coming here? It was my idea. She liked it, so... Here I am. Now you can run and tell the cops. You believe I'd do that? I believe you'd knife me in the back. The police are raiding Lapa every day looking for you. - And not finding me... - True. So they're rounding up all the queens and hoods. Very annoying. Renatinho... ...is everyone sore at me? - Could be. They say the cops won't stop until you show up. - Is that right? - That's what they say. What do you think? I don't think anything. Should I turn myself in, Renatinho? I don't know. It's your head. It's my heart, too. I'm taking off for Sao Paulo. It's too hot for me here. Maybe you can join me there when you pay your dues. It'll be easier there. "Bon voyage". Anything else? No. What are you in for? Flouting authority. Congratulations... Where? Lapa. May I have the honour? Jo?o Francisco of The Blue Danube. It's you? - In person. - I'm Agapito. It's a pleasure. Likewise. This is the deal. The house don't provide nothing. Nothing? Nothing, pal. If you want, you can rent a mattress and blanket. I collect the money and pass it on to the guards. No sweat. OK, that's a tough guy. A man you should respect... See, a real man pays his way. You can choose anyone you like in this cell. I've got it. Thanks, Agapito. Just make your love under the blanket... so as not to cause a fuss. No problem, Agapito. She's all grown up, look. What's with the lipstick? She's even saying your name. - And this? - Nothing. I'm just so happy you're out. You look great. Really rested. And your hair's still as good as a wig. I missed you. Limp fairy. You didn't even come to visit me. I was frightened. Sorry. That hurts, Laurita. Easy. Now everyone goes to Estudantina to dance. What a ballroom! It's always packed. The Blue Danube's become a real dump. - And Amador? - He's still there. We've got to go to Estudantina. It's really chic. Taboo has already made a lot of friends there. The cat got your tongue? I've got something to tell you. Go ahead. It's bad news. Spit it out. It's Renatinho. I told you he'd gone away. And? What else? You made love to him, he robbed you... and now you're pregnant? He's gone... - He didn't just leave. - Big deal. He's gone and he's never coming back. Good for him, Laurita. Don't you understand? He's dead. Dead... Messed around with the wrong guy. And got three bullets in the back. Got to Emergency still breathing. But didn't make it. It happened less than a month ago. He helped me a lot while you were locked up. And I was getting to really like him. He was crazy about you. It was him who fixed the record player. Wanted to give you a surprise when you got out. Hey, boy! Laurita told me you were out. I'm really glad. - Thanks, Amador. - Really glad. That'll teach you to stay out of trouble. That's enough. Welcome back. Cheers! Jo?o, I have an idea... What do you think about staying here? This is rotten. Staying here? Thanks, Amador, but I've got a place to stay. I mean at night, helping out. What'll I eat, Amador? Olives? Sorry, my aim's getting worse. You think my money grows in my closet, Amador? That's not it. I need someone to keep the peace. And keep the customers happy. And you'll attract more customers who'll spend more. Exactly. And how much do I get out of it? $800 a week. Plus meals and coffee? Plus meals and coffee. And drinks for Laurita? And drinks for Laurita. Sorry, Amador. I like you a lot, but I don't know if it's my thing. Amador... do you know it's Laurita's birthday next week? Well... I promised to put on a special show for her. Very good. In Lapa it's not easy... to find somewhere to put on a show, in honour of a dear friend. I know. It's getting harder and harder. So, you see, Amador... I decided to pay tribute, here in the Blue Danube... to Laurita. This is no place for a show. It's not a good idea. It's a great idea, Amador. I, myself, think so. Let me take that. "In Arabia there lived a handy but cruel Sultan. Every night he wedded a virgin... whom he screwed before morning. To put an end to this crudity... the lovely Sharazade... a virgin of rare beauty and salty perfume... " Mess up my skirt, and I'll poke your eyes out! Come on. Let's go! You're all worked up. Of course I'm worked up. I was born for this day... for the cheers of the public. Hitch the skirt up on the waist. Rearrange that necklace. Now you're beautiful! You have to thank Amador, Laurita. I told him it was your birthday. Count on me. I know how to thank him. I know what he likes. "In Arabia there lived a handsome but cruel Sultan... " Ladies and gentlemen. I am Jamacy... the queen of the forest... daughter of Tapunan and Bernadette! Answer me, my dear Lapa... Isn't life better when we sing? Yes or no? Isn't life better when we shake and swing? We're here to celebrate... the birthday of our divine Laurita. A big hand, please! Thank you! Thank you, Amador. Let's sing! Silence wraps us Like a dream Moonlight sheds Its silver beam You sleep And listen not To the songs Your love begot Moonlight Wake my lover Whom with my kisses I will smother But the moon pities me As my lover with song I caress In the mists he hides away Feeling my distress Moonlight Wake my lover Whom with kisses I will smother But the moon pities me As my lover with song I caress In the mists he hides away Feeling my distress You sleep And listen not To the songs Your love begot Moonlight Wake my lover Whom with my kisses I will smother You were a boxing champ once, right? It's been so long, I forgot. Bullshit. It's something you never forget. Never thought I'd win that fight. One day I'm going to be a champ like you, Amador. Write it down. When I was on stage, I felt an ecstatic joy. My show was a success, right, Amador? - Sure. It was funny. - Funny but a success. Yes, a success. Then I'll put on another... and sell out your bar again. - What do you want? - I want the world, Amador. Now things are looking up! The crowds will shout, "Here he comes!" I'll put my little princess in a French Catholic School. And afterwards, take her to China. As for me, I'll fix up the house and go to the movies... ...everyday in a new dress. - Laurita! - That's so cheap. - It's not. Me... I'll buy a Singer sewing machine with a pedal. Mend my kind angel's uniform. And live a life of leisure. Dream on! "There lived in China... a brute and cruel shark. And whatever it bit turned into dust. To placate the shark, the Chinese sacrificed everyday... seven wild pussycats... that it ate before sunset. To end this cruelty... came Jamacy... goddess of the Tijuca forest. She ran through the woods and flew over the hills. One day, Jamacy turned into a golden puma... salty and magical. She fought the shark... for a thousand and one nights. After so much hassle... the glorious Jamacy... and the furious shark... they were so sore that we couldn't tell one from the other. And in the end they became one and the same creature: The Divine Negress of Bulacoch?. " Beautiful! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Good evening! What am I offered for the Divine Negress? $2,OOO! - How much? - $500! For that, just the backside, Joe! The big mulatto now turns tricks And writes sambas for kicks Since a kid Goes for the glitz Never works Lives on his wits All the girls He makes them cry Because they know He prefers the guys Sunrise! It's our love blossoming Sunrise! It's our love blossoming The city is awakened And the sun bathes the sky Youth is everywhere Sadness and the moon Sunrise! It's our love blossoming. Sunrise! It's our love blossoming A promise of happiness That won't be fulfilled at all Only nostalgia remains To miss our neighbours is the law Sunrise! It's our love blossoming Sunrise! It's our love blossoming The sun washes the sadness away And joy rules over! Let's go. Bye! Amador, I am happy tonight. I am really really happy. I'm going to turn pro... become a celebrated artiste. But I won't abandon my Lapa. I want to straighten myself out. People will treat me better. - Let's dance? - Come on. After my first inhale Gulped down a litre of ale - Gimme a drink! - I was awaken by a spell In the doorway of the convent When a copper did his part Came and took away my heart - We're just closing. - I was so very good to him OK, carry on with the pansy dance. Pretend I'm not here. I'm sorry, but we're closing. You want me to go so you can get dirty, right? Please, I've just given a performance and want to relax. You're playing a woman or a man? Which is it? Queer! Nigger! - Stop that! - You shut up! Well? You going to answer me, or keep your trap shut? - Why are you doing this? - Why do you think? You like it when I grab you? Nigger faggot! You shouldn't talk to me like that. Look at that! You've got more crap on your face than a fucking whore in Lapa! Mind your own business, shithead. - The fearless fairy! - You jumped-up little toad! - Pervert! - I'm a Queen by choice! It doesn't make me less of a man! That's the way it is! It's because of niggers like you this place's going to shit! That's enough! Faggot! Pervert! Go home... ...think of tomorrow's show. - Pervert! Cocksucker! Go home. Cool down. I'll get you a glass of water. Jo?o Francisco dos Santos... is accused, under article 121 of the penal code... of first-degree murder. The accused is a repeating offender... idle and dishonest. He has confessed to the crime, admitting his intent to kill and... his will to commit the act. Therefore assuming all possible consequences. Thus, I accept the prosecutor's recommendation... and sentence Jo?o Francisco dos Santos... to 10 years' imprisonment. "For ten years was held prisoner in a castle in an island of the Arabias... a princess called Jamacy. She was held prisoner by a wicked and jealous Queen. Jamacy became very sad and lonely... till the first day of carnival... when a knight on his camel set the princess free... and she ran on foot until she got to her beloved Lapa... and she donned her costume for the carnival parade. Jamacy, all dressed up... burst onto the scene in the Carnival of'42... and became known to the whole wide world as... Madame Sat?!" "In January 1942, after ten years in jail... Jo?o Francisco dos Santos was released. " "That year he won the carnival fancy dress contest... wearing a costume inspired by Cecil B. De Mille's film: 'Madam Sat?n'." "He won many carnival contests and was jailed countless times." "On 12 April 1976, in Rio de Janeiro, Madame Sat? died at the age of 76. "
