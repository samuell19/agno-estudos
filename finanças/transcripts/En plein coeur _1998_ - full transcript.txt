Got another pair of tights? I don't think so. Oh, shit… BASED ON THE BOOK BY GEORGES SIMENON EN CAS DE MALHEUR Is it cold outside? I don't know. Want a spliff? No, I'm alright. Maybe later. -Where'd you get that? -The supermarket. It stinks! A FILM BY PIERRE JOLIVET They're doing alright. -Plenty of money in there. -Yeah. Ladies, your tickets. Samira has them. I'll find them. Oh, hey! How are you? I'm just going to say hi to my friend. -Good evening. -Do I know you? No, you should. I'll find them. Good evening. Thanks. All sorted. -Sorry. -Sorry! -Good, isn't it? -Better than last time. -Good evening, you OK? -Yes, thanks. Ah! -Good evening. -Hi. -How's it going? -Well. My husband, Maître Farnèse. -Nice to meet you. -Evening. Excuse me. Come! Did it go as you wanted with the press? Yes, pretty much. Ah, this is the Hungarian's work you mentioned. You don't find it a bit… excessive? Yes, so what? If it doesn't sell, I'd like it in my office. -Really? -Yes, really. -Good evening. -One moment. Go ahead, I'm not in a rush. -Stop pushing me! -Don't make a scene. -Stop it. Get off me. -We're going, alright? Bitch! What did you do to her? I nicked all the food! Got you! Did you get anything? Let me see. These ones and I have one in my coat. -Thanks. Have a nice evening. -You're welcome. -Sure you won't stay? -No, I'm dead. Sorry. Thought about Tuscany? Yes. If it's possible, we'll do it. I promise. It'd do us good. -What are you looking for? -My wallet. -You had it on you? -Obviously. Excuse me, could you check the floor for a black wallet? No joke, there's nothing. Thanks to credit cards, they don't use cash. -Fuck's sake. -I'll burn it all. Not that one. That's crocodile. 1,500 francs. We'll barely make rent with that. I don't fucking believe it. I'm sick of struggling. We must come up with something. What about that job? They had two vacancies. My name's Samira Alaoui, the guy didn't like it. -What an idiot. -Right! We can't go begging. Clearly. We need to think of something. Is getting a gun not an idea? -Will that work? -Yeah, that's shit scary. -Is it dear? -It's a Beretta. I don't know. 110 francs. -Because of the brand. -Yep. Don't move! Get back! Get back, I said! Give us your cash! -Don't shoot! -The cash, quick! -Cash… drawer. -Get a move on! Hurry up, goddammit! -Go on! -Quickly! Slowly. Slowly. Slowly! Shit! He's got a gun! Drop it! Don't be silly. It's just a toy. Look. We can't hurt you. OK? It's plastic. -You killed him. -No, he's moving. Police, don't move! -What do we do? -Let's scram! Chuck that thing. Follow me. -What are you doing? -Copy me. Come on, Samira. -Give me your hand. -I can't. -Climb up! -I can't! -Give me your hand. -I can't! Don't move! Go! I'll keep quiet. Go! Don't you move. Shit, she's a kid. -Have you seen Vincent? -Who? -The guy with the short hair. -I don't know. -Where might I find him? -There. Luisa, have you seen Vincent? -No. -Where can I find him? No. Leave her alone, dickhead! -Are you dancing? -No, I'm alright. I have to go. What are you doing here? Thought you were sick of my face. It's your trouble I got sick of. What's your trouble? Not working at Prisu anymore? Yeah, I only did two weeks there. -Where were you? -Slight hiccup. What do I tell him? Tell him to go fuck himself. -I tell him that? -Yes, just as I said it. Is there anyone in your flat? No. Why? I'd like to sleep there. Did Samira kick you out? If anyone asks whether you saw me last night… What do I say? Did I see you or not? I get it. I saw only you. Is the key in the usual place? Thanks. Cécile? Will you be there when I finish? Listen, dear colleague, I think you've misunderstood the situation. I've got the whole board behind my client, so the staff and trade unions will follow. The bank will follow too! Yes, but I find your client's attitude ethically unacceptable. Take it to court, sure, I'm confident about this case. I'm in a stronger position. Fine, take the risk. Henri, let's not keep arguing. I'll give you an hour, then go to summary judgement. And don't take it personally. I hope so. See you soon, Maître. There's a young woman in your office who says she has an appointment. With me, are you sure? That's what she said. Hello? Yes, Henri. I'm delighted. I think that's best. Yes. Will you call my assistant with the details? -Great. See you soon. -Friedman? Friedman. Hello. Are you sure we have an appointment? Uh, not really. That's what I thought. In that case, you need to make an appointment… You must help me. I'm going to be arrested for a robbery. A robbery? Is that all? What kind? A jeweller's. Mrs Lasserre's calling. I'll call her back. Young lady, I haven't taken this kind of case for a long time. I have a busy day. -Samira's been arrested. -Who's that? The friend I did the robbery with. Excuse me. -Can she give us 10 minutes? -I don't have time. Yes? Maître, you're due in the meeting room in 10 minutes. See, you have time. -Bordenave? -Maître? No calls until my meeting. Right, I'm listening. Well, Samira was arrested last night, just after we did it. But we didn't really do it, we didn't steal anything. So, the Chinese guy, the jeweller, rang the alarm, so I almost knocked him out. But he pointed a gun at us. A gun? Yes! That idiot could've killed us. So, I knocked him out. How? Were you armed? No, it was a toy. I didn't knock him out with that. I grabbed a Buddha on the counter. Do continue. We fled via the yard, but Samira couldn't climb on the roof. When the cops arrived, she told me to go. I had no choice. What kind of cops? I don't know, cops! Basically, they've nicked her, but she won't talk. Except, yesterday there were cops outside my place. So, I need a lawyer, right? Yes, indeed. But, as I say, I don't take this kind of case. Who gave you my address? You must have clients? Yes, but they don't rob banks, not armed. This is a criminal case. I'm not a criminal, not a real one. To a judge, there's not much difference. I'll refer you to a colleague. Spell your name. Maudet, M-A-U-D-E-T. Cécile. -Your address? -24, rue Edmond Rostand, Pantin. This guy's very good. I don't care. You're the expert, that's obvious. You didn't answer my question. How did you get my name? Where did you find that? This just gets better. We didn't even use your cards. Thank you. Is my case serious? -You were armed. -It was a toy. The jury won't care. You risk six years inside. Six years? That's insane. That's how it is. I have an idea. My friend will say we spent the night together. Yet another bad idea. That's witness tampering, perjury: three more years and your lawyer's disbarment. -What? -Disbarment. Dismissed from the Bar, finished. Will you take my case? I'm skint. Goes without saying. -If I had money, I wouldn't… -Attack a jeweller. He's not dead! Samira and I couldn't even make rent. You have arms and legs. Is there no other way? There is. You'd never understand. Why? This place reeks of money. You've no idea what it's like out there. Not taking his address? Why bother? I can't pay him either. At least tell me what to say to the cops. Just don't say anything. And don't make a scene. I'll walk you out. When they ask for your lawyer's name, tell them Maître Michel Farnèse. Thank you. Is the grocer still by rue Edmond Rostand and Boulevard Murat? Why? I grew up quite near you. I stole a fair few sweets from his shop. Mistral gagnants. What? They've probably stopped making them now. About what happened in your office… What happened? -Antoine. -Yes, Maître? Open a case for Cécile Maudet. Cécile Maudet. Then come and see me. Barely 20, no job, winter's approaching, rent's due, you get the picture. You'll make me cry. They buy a plastic gun to rob a jeweller because they assume he has cash. Obviously. That's not very smart. Nope. It sounds like a small case. Small, but not easy. Then why did you take it? Because I'm a lawyer. Uh-huh… Are the girls sexy? I only saw one, a bit lost. Can you help me? Lost, but sexy. -Why are you laughing? -Nothing, just men… What about men? Or just you. You make me laugh. Yes, that's better. -Hang on, you've a thread. -Thanks. Lili, if Marcus calls, tell him it's a yes for the exhibition. -OK. -OK? What's this? The adoption file. When did it arrive? This afternoon. -Put it on my desk? -Yes. Thanks. Good evening. -Good evening, Lili. -Good evening. Would you mind if I didn't go? No way, the car's on its way. You're their guest, not me. I'll go grab my cigarettes. I bet you're delighted the girl knew you. What girl? The one from the jeweller's. -She knew you, right? -No. Not really. How did she contact you? She found it? No, not really. This just gets better. Yes or no? That's her. There are many who would like to see you fail. Yes, I know. Then why take such a risk? I don't get it. You've nothing to prove. You're making me even more eager. I have info on the jeweller. -Go ahead. -It's from Vice. That's always good to hear. He lures girls into his shop via job ads. Excellent. And then what? He shows them a host of precious jewels… things he has on him. See? No need to worry. I bet they're young and pretty too. Wait till I get these plaintiffs on the stand. Thanks, Antoine. I knew you'd like this one. I'll draw up a list. What? Let me have some fun. I've been bored for a while now. Being bored hasn't hurt you. Yes, but you get tired of everything. Who said you could sit? I'll see the prosecutor around 5 p.m. Do you have a lawyer? Yes, he's coming. -What's his name? -Maître Farnèse. Maître Michel Farnèse? About that, Samira Alaoui is undocumented. -That's a good thing. -Yes? That's one viewpoint. With a good fight, we can have her deported to Morocco. Ask her if she approves. -Reckon the prosecutor will agree? -Maybe, it's happened before. Deportation is cheaper than detention. -Do you still live in Pantin? -Yes. Come in. Hello, Madam President. Excuse our tardiness. Seldom on time, Michel. Met the new assistant prosecutor? -William Martorel. Hello. -Nice to meet you. I don't know if I deserve to face you. You'll be fine. Maître Antoine Lorrain, my second chair. -Hello. -Right, gentlemen. shall we set a date for the first hearing? Yes. The… 31st March? Michel, are you with us? 31st March? Friday? Great, great. We'll try to be on time. We've learned that our jeweller's speciality was sexual harassment in his back shop. That's good for us. OK, thanks. I'll come by next Tuesday. What do you want? -I'm Vincent. -Michel! -You're Farnèse? -Yes. I'm Vincent Mazet, Cécile's friend. Park the car. I'll be right in. Yes? What can I say for Cécile? I won't be using your statement. Oh yeah? Smart move. How long will she get? Five years? Seven? Ten if the prosecutor can prove you lied. My arse. You're just scared shitless. That's the truth. You're wrong. You'll help her at no personal cost. You're protecting yourself, not her. My job is keeping my clients out of jail. Yours is serving drinks. Trust me, this is in your best interest too. She's my interest. Why are you talking down to me? I'm not disrespecting you. What about Samira? She's holding up. I found her an excellent colleague. You need to hang in there too. Can I count on you? Right, well… We left off in Rennes. So, your father was in construction, and then what happened? Another company hired him and we moved. Was it afterwards that you went to Paris? Vincent wrote to me. That wasn't wise. They read mail in prisons. Could I have a cigarette? Yes. They're brunes, mind. -What's that on your hand? -Nothing. No. Show me. It was just some dumb chick. Right, well, we'll file a complaint. -We can't let this happen. -Don't. It'll only get worse. Fine. I'll have you transferred. Martorel, you've misunderstood: either have Cécile Maudet transferred tonight, or I'll complain and summon the press. Is that clear? Yes, think fast, it's only 5 p.m. Fiduciary vs Caisse des Dépôts, ring any bells? I forgot about it. Let me look at the file over the weekend. This case was supposed to be a holiday for you. -Well, it is a holiday. -Oh yes? Daily visits to prison, a case that's stalled, working overtime… You're not doing well out of this case. I'm the one paying. That girl sure is lucky. So far, not so much. In fact, pretty average. The list of new witnesses. And as for that barman, Vincent Mazet, he's harassing me by phone. Antoine, I want all of these people interviewed by the end of the week. This one too? Vincent Mazet? -Can I call you on your weekend away? -Only with good news. Here, these are the last two. Then there's nothing. These are great now. Why don't you exhibit them? Because I'm not ready. Could you help me carry this to the stand behind me? -Will this one hold? -Yes, I've secured it. Hello? Maître? It's for you. Antoine Lorrain. Thanks. Yes, Antoine. Hi, Maître. Am I disturbing you? No, go ahead. I'm listening. I'm calling because I just spoke with Vincent Mazet, the barman. Guess what, he spent the night with Cécile. And so, immaculate conception: clean record, no parking fines left unpaid, nothing. But why didn't Cécile say anything? Reckon he's bluffing? Maître? Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, that's great. Nice work. I can't wait to see Martorel's face when we throw Mazet at him. -Have a nice weekend. -You too, Antoine. Thanks. Alright? I'm fine. Anything special? No, nothing special. Could you drape my jumper over my shoulders? Thank you. Please be seated. As you heard from the court clerk, Miss Samira Alaoui and Miss Cécile Maudet, you are accused of armed robbery. This crime is provided for under article 311-8 of the Penal Code and is punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment and a fine of one million francs. Let us start with a presentation of the facts. Mr Prosecutor… -I already told you. -So, who was your accomplice? You're still withholding your accomplice's name? All I can say is it wasn't Cécile. Who was it, then? Another girl. I'll never give you her name. Was there any point during that night where Cécile Maudet was alone, or out of your sight? Out of my sight? I'd be surprised. What time did you go to sleep? I can't answer that. You are obliged to answer, Mr Mazet. Oh? Well, I'm telling you I can't answer. Why not? Because we didn't stop all night. Thank you. The aim of these small ads, was it not to sexually harass young women looking for work? Mr President, that question is inadmissible. The language is insulting. What's insulting, Assistant Public Prosecutor, is that he's been convicted four times for indecent assault. So we may well question his ability to recognise Cécile Maudet, when dozens of women have caught his eye. And when I say "caught his eye", it's a figure of speech. Acquitted. Of course. You don't seem too pleased. Whereas you do. Got a light? Thanks. Want something to drink? I'd rather we went back in. Sure, let's go. Great alibi, that barman. She owes him everything. -Sounds like he was perfect. -He was. But there was a plea deal too. Where is she staying? Why do you ask? Just asking. A hotel, in Saint-Michel. Everyone's asking why you took this case. Well… what do you tell them? That I don't know. But I'm lying. I know why. Why? Because you want her. From the very first day. It's mutual, too. She maybe even knew before you did. In that case, everyone knew but me. You choose. Bordeaux or Burgundy? Viviane… What's wrong? Nothing. Give me the keys, I'll drive. Come on… Give me them! Where are you going? To Saint-Michel. Where her hotel is. Stop it… You know the address, just tell me. Viviane, don't play around. Turn right. I'm not playing. Turn right, please. Come on. Turn right, for fuck's sake! Turn right! I'm not in the mood. Not tonight. Maître, I wanted to thank you for the work you gave me. I learnt a lot. Thanks, Antoine. Congratulations, Maître, you were amazing. Thank you. I thought you'd already left. I just wanted to say goodbye. And I wanted to thank you. For the trial, the money, everything. What will you do now? I'll stay with a friend in Rennes. When are you leaving? A little later. Make sure to keep in touch. This is Cécile Maudet's, can you get it to her? Yes, she even forgot her acquittal order. No, don't worry. I'll handle it. Oh, thanks! What's that? Your acquittal. Thanks. What time is it? I don't know. I've no watch. I think I've missed my train. Good. Are you scared? I'm not scared anymore. I thought about it constantly. Constantly. Hello? -Mrs Farnèse, it's Martine. -Hi, Martine. Should I have his mail couriered to him? What mail? He left in a hurry after lunch. He didn't specify… Specify what? What I mean is… Is he feeling better? Yes, he's fine, thanks. What about the mail? Have it sent here. Ah, you're here. You're not early. We need to get a move on. Oh, the father of a student has a gallery and they want to exhibit my sitting woman statue. He saw it in my workshop. Feels weird. It's like what you were saying. I need you to sign the insurance papers. I got Antoine a gift. Make sure he gets it? -I think he'll like it. -Viviane. Be quiet. You car or mine? I'm running low on fuel. -This might not be the moment… -Be quiet! Good God, can't you just be quiet? No, not with you. Why the fuck not with me? I give you the option of saying nothing and pretending nothing happened. That's it, it's not possible. Then too bad for you. Get out. No! Come on, up you get! Up you get! Come on, up you get. Yes, I know. We think we'll die, but then we don't die. Come on. Oh no. You'll be alright, you'll be alright. -Where's your car? -Over there. But we'll go via Léon Blum stadium. -You know the stadium? -Yes. I even know a shortcut. You'll see, we're almost there. It saves five minutes. You go through here… Are you kidding? I said it was a shortcut, not that it was easy. -Send the bag over, OK? -Yes. Over we go! Here. Come, don't be scared. Yes, I'm not scared. It is quite high. -No, come on. -I'm coming. Go on! Go on! Go on, Abdul! Go on, blues! Go, go, go! Go on, blues! Hey, René! René! Oh, René! Don't you recognise me? Holy cow! Michel! I never would have expected… You know, if I hadn't seen you on TV, I wouldn't have recognised you. Marie-France said to me: "To think I put arnica on his knees!" It's true. What are you doing here? You're not moving in? No, we were in the area. This is Cécile. -Cécile, René. -Hello. You know, he could have gone pro. Stop it… He never let go of the ball. A scrappy player. Football kept me out of trouble, though. Fancy a drink? Got five minutes? Sure thing! Café on the corner? Of course, no use changing old habits. See you shortly. What's the matter? It's nice to see you like this. -Like what? -I don't know, like this! See, you don't know. "Like this." Won't we be late? No, the plane's at 4 p.m. We have time. -No? -Yes! Samira! Whoa, please. Take care of yourself. You too, take care. How is he with you? It's fine. Don't worry about me. Can we hug? Go ahead. -Let's go. -You'll get money every month. -You don't mind? -It's he who doesn't mind. I swear I'll come and see you. I swear. Look after yourself. It's for Cécile Maudet. Hi! Thanks! He wasn't too much of a pain? No, he wasn't a pain. Is that everything? What? Thanks for everything. Are you sulking? A little. You could've at least called me after the trial. -I didn't know where you were. -You still don't. Come see this. See that? Nuts, isn't it? I have to see to the cat. Did you give him water? No. Well, yes. I don't remember. Where is the cat? Can you see where he is? Now, he has water. You know Samira's in Morocco? Oh yeah? It beats prison, right? Yeah. I really miss her. No kidding. Have you seen? There's a jacuzzi. The worst thing is, you get used to this bullshit. Come and see this. There are two TVs. You can watch any film you like. Want something to drink? Gin? Vodka? Hungry? I don't think we'll stay here, he'll go broke. His mate is moving to New York. We'll stay at his. Will you host his dinner parties? Why not? Going to dress up like Claire Chazal? Sure, that's just my style. Hang on. Hello? No, he must be at work. No problem. Goodbye. Your fella… Maître Farnèse. Yeah, Farnèse. You said he was helping you until you found work, but that's bullshit. He's getting sex for free. That's not true. Did you tell him about me? There's no point. He doesn't care. -Neither do I. -No, you're jealous. -Did he buy you this? -Yes, he loves it. No kidding. You're so sexy. Stop it. You're too much sometimes. Let's go out. What do you mean? Let's go out and party. Chuck this on. -And go where? -Everywhere! Let's party! OK, give me two minutes! -Come on! -Yeah, hang on! I need to get my shoes on. -You could've upstairs. -Patient, aren't you? You noticed? -Hurry up! -Two seconds! Here, thanks. -Sorry. -That was noisy. Sorry. Sorry again. Do you mind? Budge over. You alright? Oh, Aziz. You alright? It's busy tonight! This works for you? If it works for Kirouane, it works for everyone. -They all want a good time. -What is that? -That's Vincent's woman. -She's with you? She looks good! Let me know if you leave her. Oh là là, what a mouth… Hey, you know that's my woman you're talking about? I'm not blind. She's hot. I can't help it. -What are you doing? -Stay there. No one talks about my woman like that. -You hear me, motherfucker? -Stop it! Say one more word about her and I'll smash you up. He's mental. -Ah! -Come on, let's go. -But why? -Because. End of. -What's wrong? -Come on. We're leaving. Bye. -Take me home. -No way. We're going to mine. I need to go back. Hey, how are you? -Alright? -Yeah, really good. Sorry. Hey, wait up! I need to get back. -What are you playing at? -I just need to. You've no business being with that guy. You'll never be his wife. He already has one. I know that. Have you seen her? I wouldn't even try. You're telling me you don't think you're good enough for him? You don't understand. He helped me. He's the first to value me. He got me out jail. It was me who got you out of jail. Does he know that? What do you owe him? 15,000? That's easy enough. Here are his fucking fees. If you don't pay him, you'll always be in debt, and you'll never be free! We're the same, you and I. Can't you see that? Damn, that mouth of yours. Stop. I don't want to, really. You don't want to? Are you sure? OK. But put on a condom. But there's only you, I swear. I believe you, but do it anyway. OK. Bye! At least kiss me goodbye. -Wait… -Stop it! Look what you've done! -Call me? -Yeah. -Promise? -Yes, I promise. Thank you. Shit… Are you mad at me? You mustn't be mad. Come through here. Let me see your eyes. What did you take? -Nothing. -Come here! What did you take? Did he give you that? Eh? Hang on, I'll explain. Here. Oh, sure, explain. What are you doing? There's 15,000 there! Enough for one year in jail. Do you want to go back inside? Michel, what are you doing? What are you doing? Michel, don't go. Don't go! Don't go. I'm lost, can't you see? You need to teach me. You mustn't leave. Don't go. Stop! Don't leave me like this. I need you, Michel, please. Please. Please, Michel. Why are you laughing? I don't know. Because I like making love so much. And yet, I've done it so many times. Even when I shouldn't have. But with you, it's different. It's as if it were the first time. Not for me, for you. I'm not saying I'll buy something straight away. But it would be good if James lent us his flat while he's in New York. Have you seen my alarm clock? Second drawer, dresser. Thanks. This lad keeps hassling her so she needs to change address. Where's my blue jumper? Any idea where? Viviane, I know this isn't like me, but I'm doing what I can. I'm taking things as they come. I know it's not very dignified, but I don't care. You're going mad, Michel. A vodka, no ice, please. Just in the area or here to see me? You're a smart guy. This place is nice. I have an offer for you. I'm not the boss here. Want to buy this rathole? I don't, but I hear you're keen to buy it. Me? Unlikely. I don't have that kind of cash. I heard you were making good money. Selling drugs under the counter. Have a seat. I can't. I'm just an employee. Just say a public prosecutor asked you to. Come on, sit. Any idea how much time dealers get? Have a guess, since you're so smart. Ten years inside. Not so funny, is it? Let's make a comparison, for example: perjury, that's a walk in the park, a few months, at most. Especially if you can prove it wasn't your idea. Don't bother, I'll never dob her in. Who said anything about denouncing "her"? Although, you'd have reason to be angry with her. You help her, she moves into a nice area with her lawyer… Did she send her new address, Boulevard Malesherbes? No? That's not very nice. Let's have another? The agreement must be signed before the 15th. -13-14th, you're in Brussels. -I'll delay Brussels. Hello? It's for you. Who is it? It's your fault, you shouldn't have let her in. Hello? What's happened now? I'm coming. Carry on without me. I wanted to call the cops, but the girl refused, so… I don't like this. No one likes it. Have you seen this? That's alright, thanks. Will you call Mr Bencrow? -Yes, I'll do it. -Shall I call the cops? -I'll take care of it. -Fine. Don't worry, darling. I'll fix this. It's not all that bad. Why get yourself in such a state? It's a burglary, it happens. It wasn't a burglary. I'm sure it was Vincent. I didn't think him capable of doing such a thing. Well, now you know. -What is it? -Guess! He left. Come. Come. Yes, it's me. Were you asleep? Is he there? I don't think so. Hang on, I'll check. It's fine, he's gone. I'll stay put, I promise. I'm going to Bordeaux with work, fancy joining me? We'll be back tomorrow. No, I'd rather stay. I've got a cold coming on. I don't feel great. You choose: Pauillac or Saint-Julien? What? OK, take care. Yeah, you too. Stop kissing me, my lips swell. He'll notice. Would he mind? You bet… What about you? It's not the same. How do you juggle the two of us? I don't know… -You love no one, then? -That's not it. What is it, then? Eh? What is it? You're stuck! While with you, I miss him. And when he's there, I want you. Don't think about all that. -What now? -I'm hungry. You're always hungry! Let's get breakfast? -Yeah. -Where shall we go? Ever been to Normandy? What? You could've said New York or Istanbul. You don't get it. What don't I get? I want to go to Normandy. My mum lives there. I've not seen her in ages. -OK, let's go. -Really? -But not on your bike. -Why? What's wrong with it? I freeze my arse on your bike. He's given you fancy taste. Everyone else has a car. I could have a car too. Which one do you want? Look. -Stop it. Stop! -Come on, which one? I like the Porsche. You're not going to nick a Porsche. -Why not? -Don't joke, Vincent! "Don't joke, Vincent!" -Hello? -Pass it here. Hello? The owner. Hey, don't get worked up. You could've at least filled her up. Well, wait your turn, arsehole. OK, sure, fuck you too. Want to call your mum? No, I'd rather surprise her. Sure? Yeah. -The creepy crawly crawls down… -Stop it. -Stop it! -I only need one hand to drive. Isn't that good? -No good? -Yeah, it's fine. There's no one here. It's locked up. She must have moved. Without telling you? What do you care? Come on. Ever been to Cabourg? -No. -Come on, let's go. Are you insane? Not so fast! Not so fast, I said! Watch out! Man at sea! Stop it! Stop! You really are an idiot! Hey, it's fine! Stop! Come on! Fuck! It's funny, right? Shit! Oh, Cécile, stop sulking! Cécile! You're no fun, dammit. Come on, dammit! Hello? -Mrs Farnèse? -Yes. It's William Martorel. Sorry to call so early. I tried calling Maître Farnèse at work, but I've not heard back. I need to speak with him. He's not here. Is it urgent? Not really. If you're calling this early, it must be urgent. I wanted to inform him that I'll be filing a complaint against him. I wanted to tell him myself, but I'll let you. When you see him, of course. Of course. -Thanks, Martorel. -Goodbye. Look what I brought back. Beychevelle '84. Magnificent. Isn't it a little early? It's never too early to indulge. I'm glad you're back. Hello? They hung up. Did you give him our number? It's not him, it's me. Vincent wasn't like this before. He used to be calm. I have this effect on him. Cécile, we'll change number, we'll change address, but after that, I never want to hear of him again. OK? Never again. I want peace. I want peace too. I want calm, all that. Hello? Hello? Hello? Say something! They hung up again. I don't get it. I do. Want some more coffee? No, thanks, Lili. Viviane? Yes? You can talk down the phone. You got here quick. Martorel has… -He's filing a complaint. Is it bad? -Quite, but I'll fight. Perjury? You knew the barman lied. It seemed the only option. The only option? Unbelievable! You'd ruin everything for that whore? Not a whore, a lost girl. She's not lost. You're lost! Look at you! She knows what she's doing. I know what I'm doing too! Something I should've done long ago. Leave me? Is that what you should've done long ago? -You didn't love me at all. -Stop it… What I mean is, thanks to her, I realised that I'd lost my bearings. Look at all this. I don't need it! Neither do I! I could've lived with nothing. I loved you! I would have, for you! You wanted all this, and now you blame me? I don't blame you! I'm just saying I can't explain what's happening. I can't help it. She needs me so much. And me? Do I not need you? Who do you think you are? Because of a lost girl you think you're some sort of saviour? Is that it? Is that your alibi? No. Don't you get it? I was like her, a long time ago. -If I'd been less fortunate. -Oh, cut the bullshit! She's her, and you're you! And you're 25 years older! So, if you can't see it, you're not ridiculous, you're pathetic. Clearly, you don't understand. I do, too well in fact. Don't come back! Hey. Where are you going? Well? -To see Cécile Maudet. -She's left. With all the mess up there, it's just as well. Did she leave anything for me? Who are you? Vincent. No, she left nothing. -Who is it? -It's Luisa. I'm so glad you're here. -This building is great! -Isn't it? Whoa! It's a palace! It's huge! Give me your bag. I'm so glad you're here. The Eiffel Tower's just there. There are two bedrooms and a bathroom. This here is our room, and this one is yours. This bathroom's all yours. -It's gorgeous. -Right? So, I'm your bodyguard, am I? I hope you don't mind. Vincent's getting real irritating. -Did he follow you? -I don't think so. What's he done now? Stupid stuff. -He won't let you go. -Why do you say that? -He's stopped clubbing. -Want something to drink? Wow! What a hi-fi! He gives me clothes money, but I just buy CDs. The sound is something else. Fancy a listen? Yeah! Got anything else? Yes, but he loves it. It's a problem. This is Samira's favourite track. Hang on. Luisa, Michel. This is my friend Luisa, and this is Michel. I'll turn it down. -Hello, Michel. -Hello, Luisa. Yeah… -You alright? -Yes, lovely apartment. Yes… Did you feed him? Yes, and when I bought some tins downstairs the guy called me "madame". -No… -I swear. Wow, no one's ever called me "madame". No kidding, look at you. No one's ever loved me like you do. Never. You seem nervous, Bordenave. I had a call from Martorel. You're summoned next Tuesday. So? Even if I'm struck from the Bar, I'll keep you on. You're the only woman I can't do without. Thank you, Maître. Is he still there? Yes, same place as yesterday. He's stubborn. You could say that. Here. -Hello, Martorel. -Hello. May I come in? By all means. I don't want you to reopen the case. I know my complaint will provoke a scandal, but… I thought you and your husband had separated? Your family name won't be besmirched. You've misunderstood, Martorel. I'm here for my husband, not my family. Indeed, I'm not sure I understand. In 18 years of marriage… Which Maître Farnèse just ended. I've been married 18 years, Martorel. Longer than most, perhaps longer than you will. Do you know why Michel became a lawyer? Because people have weaknesses. Because everyone makes mistakes. He made a huge one. For the first time. For one mistake, you'd ruin his whole life? He's not above the law. True, he's not infallible. But who is? Are you, Martorel? Should you trip up, might you ask for discretion for that one time? I don't know what I'd do. Obviously. For example, I didn't know I'd be doing this one day. Goodbye, Martorel. Hello! Don't shout, you'll wake her up. -She's still asleep? -Completely shattered. -What's wrong? -She didn't eat this morning. She went to bed. That's weird. It's not weird, it's normal. Normal? Why normal? Because she's pregnant. -Pregnant? -Yeah. She's scared. She doesn't know how you'll react. Well, then? Is what Luisa told me true? What? That you're pregnant. Yes, but we don't have to keep it. What are you talking about? Are you crazy? -Are you sure? -Yes, I'm sure. You're happy, then? Yes, I'm happy. This changes everything. Yes, that's for sure. My beauty… It's had more of an effect on you than me. How do you feel? I'm either tired and sleeping or feeling great. What about now? Starving. I'll go check the fridge. -Luisa, are there any chouquettes left? -Yes. I think there's some vanilla cream too. -It's a major event! -You could say that. I'll make you something nice. Under what name? Maudet, Cécile Maudet. M-A-U-D-E-T. What's the address? I trust you'll send them over today. What's the address? It's in the address book under Michel Farnèse. Fuck! Fucking hell! Fuck! Shouldn't you try eating something else now? What? I don't know, good stuff. Fresh stuff. But I really want this. -I'll stay with you tonight. -What about your client? I'll call him. Go to your match. I'll go out with Luisa. Where? Will you stop? Get anything this morning? -No, what? -I don't know, you'll see. -Want some? -Pfft! What pretty flowers. Are they by Aquarelle? Who sent them? I don't know. There's no note. There's no note? They really are pretty. FOR CECILE MAUDET Put them in your room. Thank you. -Hello. -Hello, Lili. Maître Farnèse sent me to collect his files. Sure, Antoine. I'll let Mrs Farnèse know. Hi, Antoine. Did Maître Farnèse send you? Yes, I'm after a file. A file? I'll help you. What does it look like? It's labelled BMH. -Any idea what colour it is? -No. No? Let's look here. Have you looked below? It isn't this one? Sure it's here? It might be in a drawer. Mrs Farnèse, please know that at the office… Antoine, there's nothing to say. It's not there. I'll look back here. Hang on, I think it's that one. Sorry. Will this go on much longer? Until I find her. Tell me where she is and I'll stop. She wrote to you to end things. Lovely letter. Did you dictate it to her? If it's over, she can tell me herself. You're nervous. Even with your money you're not sure of her. You can't keep her now. You think so? -Yes. -My arse. I know Cécile. She won't stay with an old man. Want to bet? I do, yeah. -I don't see anything. -Are you sure? No meetings today or tomorrow. Another small case? -Hello, Solange. -I'm off to see the president of the Bar. Weren't we meeting with Martorel? Martorel? Oh yes, he cancelled. Cancelled? Why? I have no idea. Ask him yourself. Maître Farnèse, I used to admire you, but now I envy you. I suppose I owe you thanks. Yes, but not me. Did Antoine tell you I've filed for divorce? -As you wish. -No, not as I wish. -What do you wish, then? -That you were dead. Not bad, eh? It's a bit big. Do you want the size below? No, this'll be fine. Thanks. Come in, it's open. I don't believe it. I got you the same one. The same what? The same jumper. Why did you come back? I'm not really back. Why are you here, then? To say goodbye. Goodbye? You're leaving? I'm staying, but I can't see you, Vincent. Is it because of him? No. It was my decision. Give me a good reason, then. I have one. She had some shopping to do. So, you let her go alone? Loosen the reins a bit. Do you know Vincent Mazet? Of course. That's why I worry. He's been crazy lately. Where does he live? Léon Blum Estate, in Aubervilliers. No, his address, door number, street. Shit! Cécile! Cécile! -What have you done? -Stay there. Move! Come on. Hurry up. Enough of this bullshit! Do you understand that? Hurry up! Come on! Hurry! Come on! No! You've killed him! Michel! Michel! Don't die, Michel, I'm begging you! Don't die! I'm begging you, don't die, Michel! Don't die! Call an ambulance! He's going to die! I'm not calling anyone. -Call an ambulance! -Shut up! Call an ambulance! He'll die! Michel. Don't die, I beg you. -Don't die… -Come on, hurry up. -I'm not coming. -Cécile, the cops will come. No, I'm not coming. He's dead, goddammit! He's fucking dead! Come on! Michel! No… -A man is injured! -Stop it! -Call an ambulance! -Be quiet. Come on! Please call an ambulance. No, I don't want to go. Come on! Fucking hurry up! Come on, dammit! What are you doing? Come here! What are you doing? Come on! Stop! Leave me alone. Go away. -Where are you going? -I'm going back. Are you insane? You'll end up in prison. Is that what you want? Look, I'll get some cash from a mate. Meet me at the Gare de Lyon in two hours. Do you hear me? Gare de Lyon in two hours. And don't go back there. Don't let me down, Cécile. Don't let me down. You'll be in Barcelona tomorrow. Are you alright? Yes, you're fine. Come on. Here, this is my cousin's number. I called her. She raised me. She's great, very understanding. I've put some money in your bag. Enough to last a few days. Cécile, this is my cousin Andrés. Buenos dias. Alright, Cécile? Yes, thanks. Give Samira a kiss from me. Thank you. Really. It's nothing. My friend in Barcelona can get you to Morocco. Isn't that where you're headed? Bueno. I'm cold. Toma. Thank you. Here, make the hollow clear otherwise she's an old lady. This is a young girl. So… Hang on. Work on that hollow, yeah? The smoothness, yeah? It's better with the knife. It's been a while. Ages. You look well. I'm fine. And you? It still hurts some days, but I'm alright. It always will. Here, Hervé, thank you. I hear you spent two nights at the hospital. Why not stay? They said you'd make it. Did you not press charges? No. You did the right thing. And the child? No news. It's probably best. Viviane, I'm not here by chance. I waited for you. And you're late. I know. I've plenty to do. I'm going away. Where to? Tuscany. -Are you going for long? -I don't know. I'll see once I'm there. Goodbye. Hello. This answering machine is always connected. You can leave a message or send a fax after the beep. Thank you. -Ah! -No, it's me. -Is Viviane here? -No. Has she already left? If she's not here, it means she's gone. Lili, you must help me. Is she still in Paris? She's still in Paris, yes. When does she leave? After the unveiling at the Petit Palais. When is that? You've stopped receiving invites? It's today. At 6 p.m. Thanks, Lili. -Hello. -Go on in. Hi, guys. No, I have no ticket. -It's invitation only. -My wife's inside. -Hello. -Go on in. Just two minutes. -No, that's not possible. -This is ridiculous. -Just five minutes! -You're blocking the door. Please, my wife's inside. This is ridiculous. She's there! Viviane! -Please. -Viviane! There, that's my wife. Viviane! Don't stay there. OK? Viviane? Subtitle translation by: Lucy Harford
