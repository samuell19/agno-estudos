[♪♪♪] ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ALL: Hello. [♪♪♪] Environment. Heredity. I still say environment. Heredity. It's the very foundation of social distinction. Environment. What do you think, Miss Lulu? Oh, please, gentlemen, don't get me into this. Excuse me. My dear Professor Sedletz, your theory is illogical, preponderantly impracticable, and moreover, it stinks. I'll wager you a thousand dollars my theory is correct, Professor Quackenbush. I'll accept your bet, and I'll take a man from the lowest strata of society, and within two months, through environment, make him a gentleman. It's a bet. Ahem. Pardon me, uh, professor. The plumbers are here. Come on. Boy, what a joint. They must be crooks. Yeah. This joint's prettier than the reform school. Boys, we want this gas log removed. Right. Right. All right, fellas, get busy. Oh, oh, oh! [HUMMING] [BOTH GROANING] Now, you watch your p's and q's. And you behave yourself. There are your guinea pigs, professor. If you can make gentlemen of them you will go down in posterity as having solved the Darwin theory. Hm. Quite so, Professor Sedletz. Come on, get busy. You hold the chisel, I'll cut the pipe. I'll watch. Come, let us interview them. Ooh! I'm sorry, bub. You should've honked your horn before you approached. Oh, it's nothing. I'll be all right. Hey, you with the mattress head. If I gave you a dollar, and your father gave you a dollar, how many dollars would you have? One dollar. You don't know your arithmetic. You don't know my father. [ALL LAUGHING] How would you like to make a thousand dollars? All you have to do is let me make gentlemen of you. Gentlemen? No, not that. There hasn't been a gentleman in our family for five generations. Quit bragging. For a thousand dollars we'll even become gentlemen. Good. Then it's settled. Kindly sit down. Right here. Cross your legs. May I borrow the chisel, please? Here we go. It's amazing, my dear Sedletz. Inconceivable, my dear Quackenbush. Hm. Ooh! Oh, oh. [CLEARS THROAT] Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry. You know, Professor Sedletz. There is definite evidence of vacancy of the cranium. Oh, thank you, professor. Well, you made the bet and you're stuck with them. Oh, no. I'll win. What, with those morons? STOOGES: How'd you know? And we're organized. Amalgamated Association of Morons. Local 6 and 7/8th. ALL: ♪ Oh, we are morons Tried and true ♪ ♪ We will do our yell for you ♪ [ALL GROANING] Then you've taken care of everything, Miss Lulu? Yes, sir. I have also arranged for lunch. Oh, good. Thank you. Thank you very much. We're ready. Oh, gentlemen. This is my secretary, Miss Lulu. She's going to help me with your education. Glad to meet you. [WOLF WHISTLES] Boy, what a Lulu. [HOWLS] [GROANS] And now, gentlemen, your first lesson will be table manners. You must always remember-- Pardon me, luncheon is served. STOOGES: Luncheon is served. Ha, ha, ha, luncheon. [MOE LAUGHING] [BUTLER GROANING] Now, boys, the first thing at the dinner table is the serviette. I never ate one of those. The napkin. Hey. In your lap. Oh. Good. Now, gentlemen, watch Miss Lulu carefully. Whatever she does at this table, you boys must do. We'll do everything that she does. Good. Now, pardon me, gentlemen, I'll be right back. STOOGES: Yes, sir. You know, babe, you're really the cat's meow. Absolute end. Toots, I'd love to cover you with furs. Only the best furs. Mink, skunk, porcupine. Only the best for you. LARRY: You sure are the hubba-hubba kid. Hubba-hubba. Wa-hoo. MOE: You're right, boy. What are you doing, skinhead? The professor said to do everything that she does. You stupe. Ah! [GROANS] Hey. You behave yourself or I'll crown you. "I'll crown you." Big boss. Baby, you send me. Well, why don't you go? You know, baby, you're the tops. The apple of my eye. The cranberry sauce in my turkey. Solid. You know, babe, I go for you in a big way. Give me the word. Say the word and you and I will fly around the world forever. [MOE GIGGLING] Thrilling. [LARRY MUMBLING] LARRY: Gorgeous. Oh. Ow! Hm. Now we'll resume with the lesson. You may start serving, Sappington. Some olives and celery, Miss Lulu? Thank you, Sappington. Thank you. I love celery. [CRUNCHING] Olive, sir? Oh, thank you. [PLOPPING] Hey. What's the idea eating all those olives? Because I like them. [CROAKS] Water, water. [GLUGGING] I was choking on those olive pits. I ought to choke you. Oh, shut up. [GROANING] [SQUEALS] Your soup, Miss Lulu. Thank you, Sappington. Soup, sir. [SLURPING] [PANTING] What's the matter? Soup too hot? No, too salty. [BOTH SLURPING] Want me some Worcestershir-- Shire sauce. I can't say Worcestershire. Hey, Moe. There's a hair on my plate. That's no hair, it's a crack. It's the first time I've ever seen a crack wiggle like that. Oh, that's neither hair nor there. [BOTH SLURPING] Boy, I love noodles. Me too. Uh-uh. Manners. [SLURPING] Boys, you do not slurp soup. Oh! I don't know why, Moe, but I'm still hungry. It must be your tapeworm. Delicious. Just like the cans my mother used to make. [SLURPING] [MEOWS] Now we're going to have our first reading lesson. Turn to page one. Moe, you read. [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] Oh. "Oh, see the pretty cat. Does the mouse see the cat?" Yes, the dirty rat. Don't get personal. Boys, boys. Now, Joe, you read. "Pa-- Paga-- Paganinny." "Paganinny"? That's "page nine." Oh. "Oh, see the little deer. Does the deer have a little doe?" Yeah. Two bucks. QUACKENBUSH: Here. Now, now. No more of this levity. Larry. "Oh, see the putty cat. Does the cat have chickens?" That's "kittens." Cats do not have chickens. Oh, no? Well, my cat got in the chicken house, and that cat had chickens. [STOOGES LAUGHING] Oh, no! [BOTH MUMBLING] [INAUDIBLE CHATTERING] Well, here we are. Oh, good. Boys, remember all that you've been taught these past weeks. And if your debut into society is successful tonight, the money is yours. Professor Quackenbush, have no qualms or trepidations. JOE: We will justify your faith in us indubitably, sir. Precisely. The extracurricular scholastics and the vicissitudes we have encountered have elevated us to astronomical fields of learning. If I may be so pedantic. [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] Precisely. Precisely. Oh, fine, gentlemen. Now, introduce the boys. Go ahead. Yes, sir. Good evening, ladies. Well, good evening. May I present Mr. Joe, Moe, and Larry? Mrs. Cataracts. How do you do? Delighted. Devastated. Dilapidated. And the Countess Spritzwasser. Charmed. Enraptured. Enchanted. Embalmed. You know, this is a lovely party. Delightful. Champagne.

My dear young man. Do tell me about yourself. Well, you see, it-- Well, that is, uh-- You'll pardon me. If you don't tell me all about this metamorphosis, I shall always feel that I have missed something. Lady, if you don't leave right now, you're not gonna miss anything. I-- Young man, what's wrong? You act as though the Sword of Damocles is hanging over your head. Lady, you must be psychic. I wonder what's wrong with that young man. [GASPING] [LAUGHING] Oh! You feather-brained imbecile. Are you trying to ruin us too? [GASPS] You know, you're a little bit too bossy. Ah! Ooh. Oh. I'm too bossy, huh? A wise guy. [CHUCKLING] Oh! [WOMEN SHRIEKING] [LAUGHING] You forgot to duck. So did you. WOMAN: For goodness' sake. Oh, you. Why, you... No, no, no, no! [GASPS] Oh, how terrible. [WOMAN SHRIEKS] Look what you did. Now, wait a minute, Moe. Don't! Oh! Oh! No, wait. Wait, let's call a truce. Come on, now. Come on, you started this. Your drink, madam. WOMAN: For goodness' sake. Pardon me, madam. Stop it. Stop it this minute. You disgraceful vagabonds! Oh! Oh. Oh. Who do you think you're talking to? So you want to play rough, do you? Well... BOTH: Wait a minute. Now you stop that. [CROWD CLAMORING] WOMAN: For goodness' sake. Wait a minute. Wait, I said. [WOMAN SHRIEKS] Thank you, thank you for your check. Well. It looks like I won after all. [LAUGHS] [CHUCKLING] Here's your check back. A wise guy, eh? How do you like that? Why, you... Oh.
