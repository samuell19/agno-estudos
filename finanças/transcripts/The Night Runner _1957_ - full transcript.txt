Release recommended. - "Recommendation of patient psychiatrist Dr. Neil Crawford." - "Report of patient psychiatrist, Roy Turner, 2811. Although patient has responded well to treatment, he is still considered a disturbed personality, not yet completely cured. Release is not recommended at this time." - May I ask you, Doctor, when is a mental patient completely cured? - Only 18 months ago, Dr. Royce. Roy Turner tried to kill a stranger in the street. - He was "I then. - He may still be ill. Overworked, unfair treatment on his job and a negative family background once drove Roy Turner beyond his limit, Doctor. Oh, we've brought him back, but how far? I'm not sure. - When will you be sure? We're never sure. Every time we open the door in a case like this, we're taking a chance. We'll take less of a chance with Roy Turner if I can have another six months. - Dr. Crawford, each patient needs so many square feet in the hospital ward. So much linen, so much food, so many hours of a doctor's time. Roy Turner has had all we can afford to give him. How many patients do you think a psychiatrist like yourself should handle here, Dr. Crawford? - 50, 55 Perhaps. - How many are you handling? - 185. - Oh. Should we keep Roy Turner here, Doctor, and make it 186? How much will that help Turner or your other patients? - Recommendation of patient psychiatrist, Roy Turner, 2811. Release is recommended. - Roy? Wait up, I'll walk to the bus with you. Well, how do you feel? - A little nervous. - Diagnosis, normal. What are your plans, Roy? - Well, I'm gonna get a job as soon as I can. I'm going to Los Angeles. They need draftsman there in the aircraft factories. I know I can find something. - Sure you will. You've got a lot of talent. Roy, if a deep sea diver comes up all at once, he gets the bends. To prevent that they pop him into a decompression chamber for awhile so that the return to what he was used to was gradual. Now, you may need the same treatment. The pressure is different out there. There's emotional stress and strain, lots of it. It can twist you until you snap, Roy. It happened once, it can happen again. Watch your step, huh? All aboard. - Start off slowly, Roy. Don't let tension mount in you. When you feel trouble coming, back off. You won't be a coward, you know that now. All aboard. - Remember, no stress, no strength. Make it your slogan, okay? Will you drop me a line, a postcard? So long, Roy. - Thanks, Doc. Thanks for everything. - Would you like to fill out a card? Your name, please. Just be seated, we'll call you. Mr. Reynolds, you're next. Yes it is, thank you. Mr. Turner, please. Mr. Turner? - I believe you're being called. - Hello, have a seat. I'll take that. What's your address, Mr. Turner? - Oh, well I haven't got an address. I just came into Los Angeles today. - I see. Where were you last employed, Mr. Turner? - The International Design Corporation. - How long ago was that? - It was two years ago. - And your reason for leaving? Your reason for leaving? - Hey, look out you crazy fool! - Stop it, stop it, stop it! Please stop it! You all right, honey? I'm all right now. That guy must be out of his mind. - 10 minutes, folks. Watch your step getting out, please. - Where? - Inside, first door to your left. Thanks! Beats the smog, doesn't it? - Does the weather stay like this pretty much? - Every day during the winter. No rain, no fog, no smog. Also, no people. Hey, would you mind handing me that wrench on the fender? - Sure. Thanks. Goin' all the way up the coast? - I'm not sure. I thought maybe I'd find a little place around here with some sunshine. - Been sick? -Yes, I... - A lot of folks head out this way when they're lookin' for a rest. What hit you, one of those virus bugs? I said what hit... Hey! Hey, you all right? You're white as a sheet, boy. You want some water? - No, it's all right. I haven't been feeling so well. - Lunch! It's our first, watch out for the questions. - We're fresh out of breast of pheasant, Sir, so you get a melted cheese sandwich. Hello. - Hi. - Are you a father? - No. - Too bad. You're nice looking. - Down, girl. See? She's eating for three. - I can't help it, I'll get you another one. I'm starved. - Always. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Okay, let's go folks! - Is there a nice place to stay around here? - Well, there's a motel about a quarter of a mile up the road. The Seaside Cottages. Are you thinking of doing your resting here? - Well, that's an idea. Oh, well, thanks. Thanks for everything. I enjoyed talking to you. Goodbye. - So long. - What are you staring at? -Hm? - Nothing. - What happened, your car break down? - No. Where are you heading? - Goin' that way. Goin' far? - Is there any law against it if I am? - No, not if you're not hitchhiking. And may I see some identification, please? - Sure. - Thank you, Mr. Turner. Goodbye. - Have you got a vacancy? - Where'd you park your car? - Well, I don't have a car. I came on the bus. - $6 a day, $35 a week. Pay in advance. - Okay. - Okay, what? Okay for a week. - All right. Sign up inside. Can you sign this, please? This your first visit to this part of the country? - No, I was here once before at a job. - A salesman, Mr. Turner? - No. - Sort of a game with me, guessing people's occupation. Mechanic? Office worker? - How many guesses do you get in your game? That'll be 35 out of 40. Susan, number three ready? Just needs towels, I'll get them. - I'm a draftsman. - Susan? - Coming, coming. You need towels again. I found three with holes the size of a cantaloupe before I got to these. Hello. - How do you do? - Mr. Turner? May I present Ms. Susan Mayes, my daughter. - How do you do, Mr. Turner? May I show you to your cottage? - I was staring. Oh, thanks. Oh, oh, don't mind Dad. Mother always used to say he was a grumbler in the off season. - Oh, we'll get along all right. - Hello, Ms. Susan. - Hello, Vernon. Oh, Vernon's the handyman. Just whistle for him if anything won't open, close, go on or off, or stop or start. - Well, that is a handyman. Boy, I'm glad I stopped here. I didn't even know I was going to until, until about a minute before the bus pulled out. You're impulsive. Yeah, I guess so. I once got off a ship in Havana after the gang plank was there because I couldn't stand the color of the smoke stacks. - If I ever got on a ship, Mr. Turner, that was going in or out of Havana or anyplace else, I wouldn't get off if the smoke stacks were painted like peppermint sticks. - A little tired of the same scenery, huh? - No, a little anxious to see more. - Well, you can get anxious in a Hawaii or Havana or Rio. One place is just like the next? - No, places are the way they make you feel. See, I'm here right now because the fellow runs the garage next to the bus stop was nice to me, and his wife. - Oh, oh, Amy. Honestly, Amy acts as though she invented pregnancy. - Yeah, I know. We hadn't even met and she wanted to know if I was a father. - Are you? - No, I'm not even spoken for. Oh. This is a little smaller than the other cottages. It has the best view of the ocean. It's warm enough to sunbathe in the middle of the day. How's the water? - Oh, freezing. - Oh, thanks for showing me to my room. - Oh, you're welcome. I heard you say you were going to be with us for a week. - Well, maybe a little longer. I'm resting up. - Oh, well, if you need anything, there's always someone in the office. - Goodbye. - Bye. The sand is softer. Am I disturbing you? - Huh uh. I don't allow myself to be temperamental. I'm not good enough yet. - Well, do you mind if I take a look? - Help yourself. It's very good. - Not really. I'm having an awful lot of trouble with my sky. The blue won't come alive. - Well, what are you using? - Ultramarine and Cobalt. - I think a little Prussian Blue might help. Oh, do you paint? - No, no, I don't paint, but I used to. I couldn't get the sun, the sky or the sea to come alive. Oh. - That is good. - I hope so. I want to enter it in the fall show in Santa Barbara. I didn't even get by the preliminary judging last year or the year before for that matter. - You really stay with something, don't you? - Oh, I'd keep painting even if there wasn't a show. - Well, that's enough for awhile. - Well, don't stop because of me. - I need a rest, unless you'd rather be alone? - Oh, no. Would you like a cigarette? - Uh huh. - Oh, it's nice here, isn't it? It's my favorite spot. I used to do my daydreaming here when I was a little girl. I was Florence Nightingale laying cool hands on fevered brows. Dirty little hands, I'm afraid. What did you daydream about? - I didn't, I was too busy with my hobby. - Oh? What was that? - Well, my father had a store near the Atlantic Ocean, and I kept birds on the roof. What kind? - Seagulls, cranes, sandpipers. Of course, I couldn't keep the big birds captive but they came around in time for dinner all right. There was one in particular. He was a seagull with a big black spot on his throat. I used to call him Bullseye. He was magnificent in flight. Poetic. I fed him every day for two years. - Why did you stop? Why did you stop? - Because a mean old man shot him for sport. - How terrible! - Yes. I couldn't do anything about it. I was just a boy. - But what about your father? Couldn't he do something? - My father was the mean old man. Bullseye was bigger. I shipped out on a freighter as a cabin boy a few days after that. I ran away from home. - Did you ever go back home? - No. No, home ended while I was away. My parents were killed in a car accident. - I'm sorry. - Oh, that's all right. Look, I'd rather hear about the life of Susan Mayes. Ask me 10 years from now. - I would like to. You know, I think the Prussian Blue will give you just the color you want. Is anybody home? Be right with you. Make yourself comfortable. Well, thanks. - No complaints I hope. Oh, no. That's very cute. - Thank you. - I was just wondering if you could tell me a good place to eat within walking distance. - Well, the cafe at the bus stop's the only place within walking distance. - Thanks. - But my coffee's a lot better than you'll get at the cafe. Besides, Dad had to go into LA at the last minute, so there's a good dinner waiting. - Well, how's the service? - With a smile. Invitation accepted? - Sure. - Come on. - Oh, I wonder if I could send one of these? I promised a friend I'd keep in touch. - Please. They're all the motel, though. That's why they're free. I'll get things going. Stamps are under the blotter. - Thanks. - I won't be two minutes. There's a television set in the next room. Okay. - Hey, where is everybody? - In here, Ed. Hi, baby. - Oh, Ed, put me down. Ed, this is Roy Turner. Ed Wallace, Roy. - Hello, Turner. - How do you do? - We met earlier on the road. - Yes, the officer considered me a suspicious character. Oh. - Anybody want anything? No thanks, we're just about to have dinner. - Oh? Is your father around, Susan? - No, he went into LA. - You stayin' here, Turner? - Yes. - Gonna be around long? - I don't know. Why don't you sit down? - No, not me, I sit all day. - Roy? - Sure. Where are you from, Turner? - The East. Whereabouts? - On the Atlantic Coast. North or South? - You're asking an awful lot of questions, Ed. - Cigarette? - Oh, oh, no thanks. - I'll have one. - Oh, sorry. You lookin' for work? There's a shortage in the factories up north if you're interested. All sorts of skilled labor. Any specialty? What kinda work do you do? - Oh, I'm terribly sorry. It fell right outta my hand. - Thanks for the beer. Tell your father I said hello. See you later, Turner. - It was a lie. I smashed it. - Why did you smash it? - Well, I haven't been feeling very well lately in the... I've been kinda jumpy. I guess I just haven't got it whipped yet. - You'll Whip it. ♪ When I was young I used to wait ♪ ♪ An old master and give him his plate ♪ ♪ And pass the bottle and he got dry ♪ ♪ And brushed away the blue tail fly ♪ ♪ Jimmy, crack com, I don't care ♪ ♪ Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care ♪ ♪ Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care ♪ ♪ My master's gone away ♪ - Amy! ♪ And when he'd ride in the afternoon ♪ ♪ I'd follow after, with a hickory broom ♪ - Oh, no. ♪ The pony being rather shy ♪ Oh no!

To overcome my frustration I'll eat. What did you pack, Susan? - Oh, everything you'd like. Chocolate covered spaghetti, ice cream with chopped pickles and strawberry meatballs. - With pistachio gravy? - Oh, cut it out. You're making me sick. - It's making me hungry. - Boy, what a day. And you were right about your winter weather here, Hank. - Well, it sure hasn't hurt you any, Roy. Roy nearly passed out at my place a week ago. - Oh, I just need a little rest. - It's nice here all year round, Roy. - You thinking of staying around, Roy? - Well, I don't know. I'd have to get a job. What do you do? - I'm a draftsman. - Say, they're taking people on up at Martin Engineering. Maybe they need draftsman. - It's only five miles from here. - That's not very far, is it? - Well, let's get things ready. - Can I help you? - No and you can't either, Susan. - Hank, and I'll get this. Go on, take a walk. Talk to nature. Anything. Hank and I would like a few minutes by ourselves, you know? - I couldn't live without them. I'll whistle when we're ready, Roy. - Okay. Susan. Thanks. - You're not supposed to frown on the beach. You'll get a funny sunburn. Oh. - What's the trouble? - It's Martin Engineering. - Are you really going to look for a job there? Well, I'd like to. - But? - It's the interview. I get nervous when people ask me a lot of questions, though. I know it's foolish, I... - Absolutely. Name please. - Uh, Roy Turner. - Address, Mr. Turner? - Seaside Cottages. Six a day, 35 a week. - Age? - I'm 27. - I'm 22. Occupation, Mr. Turner? - I'm a draftsman. - Good, we need a draftsman. See how nice it's going? Where were you last employed, Mr. Turner. - International Design Cooperation. - How long ago was that, Sir? - It was two years ago. - And your reason for leaving, Mr. Turner? I asked you a reason for leaving, Mr. Turner. Were you ill? - No. - What was the trouble, Mr. Turner? A personal problem? - Yes. - Do you still have your personal problem, Mr. Turner? - I don't think so. - Fine, Mr. Turner. Now, would you mind demonstrating your ability as a draftsman, Sir? I'm confused, Mr. Turner. It looks like a carrot and two hair pins. What is it? - Well, it's two hairpins and a carrot. Oh! - Come and get it. - Hungry? - Yes, I'm starving. - Come on. - Thank you. I had a wonderful time. - Oh, me too. - I don't know which was more fun, listening to Amy at lunch at the beach, or listening to Amy at the drive in at dinner. She's crazy. I haven't had as much fun in a long time. - I don't know if I ever did. - Well, I'd better let you go in now. You wanna be rested for your attack on Martin Engineering. We're going to get that job, Roy. Did you get the job? - Just about. I gotta call in at five o'clock. Someone else is being considered? - Three someone else's, but I got 'em all licked on background, education and experience. - Oh, smart man. - Oh! - Feel that good? - No, I feel better. - Careful, you'll explode. - Not a chance. No stress, no strain. Hey, what about a celebration tonight after five o'clock? - It'll have to be a late date. I promised Amy I'd drive her to LA. She's going to have dinner with the folks. Hank's got to work. I'll be back by nine. - I'll be waiting. - Hello, Dad. Susan, I can't find anything around here anymore. Where did you put last month's bank statement? - Bottom drawer underneath the checkbook. -Hm? Oh. Susan, you haven't checked the statement with the stubs. Oh, I forgot. I'll do it first thing in the morning. I'm late now, Dad. - Late for what? Where are you going? I'm taking Amy into LA. - Oh. - Where were you all afternoon? - I drove Roy to Martin Engineering. - What for? - He applied for a job there. That's a surprise. - Roy is nice, Dad. - All young men are nice to girls at your age. Just what do you know about him? - I think I'm in love with him. - Oh, Susan, you don't make sense. Well, this Turner's a stranger. No, he isn't. We've spent a lot of time together. - Sure you have, a whole week. Oh now, look, honey, people don't fall in love that fast. Who is this Turner? Where is he from? Who are his people? - I don't know. - And yet you say you're in love with him. - I said I think I'm in love with him. Susan. - Dad, I know what I'm doing. I'm not a little girl anymore. - Well, then for heaven's sake, don't behave like that. - Dad! You didn't give me the money for the towels you want me to pick up. I'll need $20. Oh, now look at that. Oh, Dad. - Here's the $20. Susan? Honey, I'm sorry we argued. - Me too. - Oh, Susan? Here. Bye Amy a cocktail. - Thanks, Dad. Bye. - Goodbye, hun. Good luck, Roy. - Have fun. - How are ya? - Hi, Loren. Swap ya even. - Thanks, Don. - How do you do? - Good afternoon. - Do you have a nice quiet cottage for rent off the highway? - All of our cottages are off the highway. - Well, that's something. Silence is golden, you know? - Yes, I know. Now, if you'll sign right there, please. Oh, that's $6 a night, $35 a week. - I'll just need it for one night. - Thank you. Vernon? Vernon? The handyman will show you to your room. - Thank you. - Easy, Roy. You're gonna wear out my garage. - If I get that job, I'll buy you another one. - You'll get it. Amy dreamed it was won last night. That's good luck according to her dream book. - Is that for swans or people? Hey, look, do you think that five to five is too soon? - Go ahead. Maybe their clock is fast. - Yeah. Hello. May I speak to Mr. Rodman in the Personnel Department, please? Hello, Mr. Rodman? This is Roy Turner, the fellow that spoke to you about the job today. I do? Oh, thank you, Sir. Oh, yes, Sir. Monday morning, eight o'clock. Right, Sir. Thank you. - Amy dreamed good, huh? - Perfect. - Congratulations. - Same to you. You're the one that put me on the job. - Okay, congratulations to both of us. When do we celebrate? - Tonight when the girls get back. - That's nine o'clock. Why don't we get a headstart? Drinks and dinner on me? - Well, I'd like to clean up before Susan gets back. - Don't worry, I'll get you back at the motel in plenty of time to slick up. Closed for business on account of Roy Turner. Are you sure you two aren't gonna wanna celebrate privately? - What, spoil a party for, Amy? Not a chance. See you in about an hour. - I'm with you. - Oh, Mr. Mayes, I locked myself out. Could I have a pass key? - That's $17.50 rebate, Mr. Turner, for the half a week left in your room. - You want me to leave? - The sooner the better. - But why? - You know I've never trusted you since the day you got here, Turner. No car, no job, no nothing. But that didn't matter 'til you took up with Susan, and who and what you were and where you came from became important. - What do you know about me? - Everything. Let me set you straight. I didn't raise Susan for 22 years to have her snatched up by some shiftless no-account. - I have a job. - On false pretenses. Or does the Martin Engineering Company know that you're sick up here? Does Susan know? - I'm not sick. I'm better. They said I was better. - For how long? No thanks, Turner. I don't want you around here. Now, why don't you just clear out and avoid the embarrassment of explaining to Susan and to the Martin Engineering Company that there's nothing really wrong with a lunatic. Take your stuff. Get out. That's the end of the line. Sheriff, you got a prisoner there and we want him. Not while I'm the law. Hold it boys, close those shutters there. I'm gonna let you loose so you can help us fight 'em off. But you're still under arrest. Thanks, Sheriff. Mind those horses on the wagon, are you gonna- - Hello? - I'm sorry, but we haven't got any vacancies. - At this time of the year? - Well, it's the plumbing, we have no hot water. - Oh, that's too bad. - Come on Stanley, let's try the next place. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Stampede, stampede! Stampede! - Would you mind turning down that noise in there? Help! Somebody! - Oh, help! In here. In here, on the floor. - He's dead. Operator, give me the police. - Then after you screamed, Ms. Dodd, you ran out on the porch, is that correct? - Yes. - I saw him outside and I called to him. - What brought you out of your cottage, Mr. Turner? Ms. Dodd's scream? - That's right, yes. - What were you doing at the time? - Well, I was shaving. - I see. Did you hear anything unusual earlier? A disturbance of any sort? - No, no. - Did you hear a car pull up or leave? - Not that I remember. - I did. I heard a car leave. - When was that? - Well, I don't remember the exact time, but it was a little while before I came up here. - About how long before? Five or 10 minutes? - Yes, something like that. - Did you hear the car? - Hm. No, I don't think so. - How 'bout you? - I was at the cafe. - That's right, I checked. Where can you be reached Ms. Dodd, in case we need you later? I live in Sacramento, 2800 Barnett Place. Mr. Turner? - Well, I'm living here right now. - Oh, are you employed around here? - Well, starting Monday at Martin Engineering. - I see. Thank you, Mr. Turner. That's all. - Susan is going to stay with us for a few days, Roy. - I'll drop 'round and see you tomorrow. - I better be by myself a few days. Thanks. - Excuse me. You finished your prints yet, McDermott? - All through, Captain. I couldn't do better myself, Mr. Turner. You're just about a professional gardener now. - Yeah, with blisters than everything. Oh, Vernon, you wanna get that top soil now? - Sure thing. - Hello, Turner. - Hiya. - Susan around? - No, she's still over with Amy and Hank. - How is she? - Well, Amy says she's feeling better. - You know, it's a funny thing, Turner, in a case like this we ought to have some lead by now, a string of similar robberies, some of the stolen stuff like the jewelry that was taken and shows up in a pawn shop, somethin' like that but we haven't hit on a single thing yet that we can tie onto. You didn't see anybody hangin' around here a couple of days before the murder, did you? - No, I think I told you that. - Yeah, I know, but sometimes people remember things later on. You didn't see Mr. Mayes talking to any strangers a day or two before? - No. - It was just a thought. How do you like your new job? - Oh, it's fine. Draftsman, aren't ya? - Yeah. - Must be interesting work. Well, tell Susan I was askin' for her will ya? - Sure. - So long, Turner. - So long. - Thanks, Ed, but everything's being taken care of. - Turner? - Mm, he's been wonderful. - Well, we'll see you later. - Bye, Ed. - Welcome home. - Hello. - What happened to your car? - Nothing. But I thought something would happen to my legs if I didn't start using them. Hey, you haven't been idle. - Oh, me and Vernon. I'd draw the plans, he does the heavy works. - After drawing plans all day? That's not much of a change. - I missed you, Susan. - I missed you. How's everything at Martin Engineering? - Well, I think it's gonna be Martin and Turner Engineering pretty soon. Then Turner and Martin, I suppose? - Yes, I think I'll keep 'em on. - Amy says she misses you. She'd like us to go out to dinner with them tonight. - Well, do you want to go out? - Mm hm. - All right, you got a date. - Oh, I'm stuffed. - I'm starved. Well, sure, you forgot to eat before dinner. - Will there be anything else? - Yes, I'd like- - Just the check, please. - It's on me tonight. - But I brought Amy. - No, it's on the very rich man today. You'll be asking for a raise on Tuesday. - Roy? Hm? Where did you get this Roy, this $5 bill? - I don't know, why? - It's stained. It looks like nail polish on it actually. - So? - I spilled nail polish in the cash drawer the morning Dad was killed. It made a splotch on the top bill like this one. It was a $5 bill. - You think that's the same bill? - Susan, lots of people have spilled nail polish on money. I did it once. - I think I'll keep this, Roy. The police might wanna check and see if it is my nail polish on it. - Well, how could it be? It's 1,000 to one it isn't the same bill, Susan. - Susan, remember what we said this morning? How everything keeps reminding you of what happened? Maybe you should sell the motel, Susan, soon. - Thank you, Sir. - Well, folks, where do we go from here? Dinner? - How 'bout a ride up the coast and a nightcap someplace? Ladies? - Fine. I'm with you. - Oh, Hank, why don't you get the car? I'll meet you out front. Right on. Your change, Sir. - You can take my word for it, Ms. Mayes. We'll get you better than the market price, and in a hurry. - I hope so. - I know so. I'll come by first thing in the morning and pick up the inventory. Goodbye Ms. Mayes, and thanks for the listing. - Goodbye, Mr. Rogers. - Goodbye, Mr. Turner. - Goodbye. - The real estate man sounds optimistic. - That's an occupational disease. - You sound pessimistic. - That is also an occupational disease. We linen counters are a very solemn lot. Fine day of rest you've had. - That was the nicest Sunday I ever spent. - You linen counters are also a romantic lot. Where were we? - Sheets, bed, single. - Eight, 12, 16, 17. - 17 checks. Sheets, bed, double. Stationary, boxes of? - Eight. - Eight checks. Desk pen set? - Desk pen set, one only. - One and only checks. Folder and the registration card. - Also one and only. What's the matter? - This registration card. It's dated October the 26th, the day Dad was killed. - Well, that was the last day the motel was open for business, Susan. - I know, that's not what I mean. Look, someone started to register and then stopped. - So? - Don't you see that this someone, this Mister and Missus were here at the motel the day of the murder. - You think these people are the ones that killed your father? - It's possible. Or maybe they saw something the police ought to know about. - Well, how could we get in touch with these people? - It might not be so hard. If for some reason or other they changed their minds about staying here, if they weren't the murderers, they'd stop at the next motel along the way, wouldn't they? - That's right. - The police can check the motels up and down the highway. See if a couple registered on the 26th. - There must have been hundreds of couples registered that night. Not this time of year. Besides, we have a piece of handwriting for comparison. - But it's just two words. - That could be enough. What are you doing with that? - I'm gonna take it to Ed Wallace tomorrow, or maybe tonight. - That's a good idea. Mr. Turner? - Yes, what is it, Vernon? - Could I see you out here, please? - Well, I'm very busy right now, Vernon. Ms. Susan and I are busy. But it'll only take a minute, Mr. Turner. It's important. - All right, I'll be right out. I guess I'd better go speak to him. What is it, Vernon? - I found this. It's Mr. Mayes's watch, one of the things the murderer took. It was buried out back. I didn't wanna upset Ms. Susan. - When did you find it? - Just now? I went back to get my shovel. We dug up some weeds out there today, and I saw something shining in the moonlight. Should we call the police, Mr. Turner? - No! You better give me a chance to break it to Ms. Susan. You'd better go back to your room, Vernon, and I'll speak to you later. - Something wrong? Everything's all right. - Yes, everything's all right, Ms. Susan. What was it? - Oh, it wasn't anything. He just wanted a few dollars. - Oh. Come back to work? - I'm afraid I'd only make mistakes. - Too much moon? - Too much Susan. The beach must be wonderful tonight. Can we take 10? You'll stretch it to 20. - I know. Do you remember the first time we were on this beach together, Susan? - Of course. On the other side of these rocks, I was painting. We talked about daydreams. - I said I didn't daydream. That wasn't the truth. I was daydreaming even then, even while we talked about it. - About what? - About a life together with you. I fell in love with you that day, Susan. - We'd just met, Roy. - But you fell in love too, didn't you? - Mm hm. - Now, if only your father hadn't interfered. - What made you say that, Roy? - Well, he never really gave us a chance. Why did he hate me, Susan? He didn't hate you, Roy. - Oh, he did. And I loved you Susan. - Roy? - Hm? - Why did you say that about my father? - Well, he didn't like me from the beginning. And when he found out where I came from, he wasn't gonna let me have anything to do with you. - Where you came from? - Susan... Susan, you can't show that registration card to Ed tomorrow. - Why not? Why can't I show Ed the registration card? - Well, things could have been all right here, Susan. Your father didn't have to interfere. - Roy, why can't I show Ed the registration card? - You could have been happy here, Susan. You could have painted on the beach when I was working, when I came home at night, you'd kiss me hello. - Why did you say that about my father, Roy? - We would have nice friends. Vernon would work for us. We'd go out sometimes with Amy and Hank. - You don't make sense. - But I did. Dr. Crawford said I made sense. That's why they let me go. But Dr. Crawford said I had to be careful. He said I should back away from trouble and I did. But I couldn't back away from your father, Susan. He wouldn't let me. Your father had no right to open that letter. Everything was going fine until then. Everybody liked me. But he found out about me. He called me a lunatic, and he was gonna tell you and the Martin Engineering people and everybody, and I couldn't allow it. Sol had to kill him, Susan, because I loved you. I have to kill you now for the same reason, because you know what I did. - No! No, no! Operator, get me the police. Police? Let me have Sergeant Wallace. Wallace? This is Roy Turner. I killed Loren Mayes. Please, come and get me quickly.
