Hello Mr Kaethner, could I get a second of your time? Got to tell you about my fantastic idea. No time, but go ahead. Ok, so you see: People loved the ''Titanic'' movie right? So get this: We put some people in costumes, Put them all on a big ship And we stick cameras in every room. We put the rich on the top floor And the poor go in the basement. All playing against each other for money In the night we put the lifeboats In the water or whatever, who cares, And after 30 days we sink the boat! If you've gotten rich you can keep the money, The poor get chucked in the water! It's ''Titanic'' meets ''Big Brother!'' Can you Imagine the ratings on a Saturday? This is going to be a hit! An absolute Hit! Guaranteed ! Yeah, yeah, sure. Give it to me, I'll take a look. - Thanks a lot! Cool car! - Yeah. Mr Kaethner? - Spastic ... You've been parked in! Fuck off! Yeah! What the fuck is this? Can I help you? Is there a problem? Do you have a problem? Are you fucking with me? Are you fucking with me? Are you fucking with me? Do you like that? Do you want more? Some more maybe? Like that? Is it making you horny or what? Faggots. >>GET YOUR SUPER BABY Here we are again with ''Get your super baby'', The show that shows how things REALLY are with German men.

The swimming coach Valeriu Tiriac Hung himself yesterday, After reports on tv channel TTS Made him lose his license. His 20-year old niece said That the reports were ''mere mud slinging and sensationalism.'' The verity and fairness of the reports investigation has been called into question. Rainer Kaethner, Responsible for the report Said that it was''just a tragic accident.'' and refused to accept any blame for the report. No! I just want to drop this pseudo-researched bullshit reporting With hidden cameras in a brothel! People WILL watch this. Believe me, They are not as stupid as you think. No it should be about stuff that people don't know but should know You understand what I'm talking about? Quarter past eight. Ok, it's a deal. Good. We'll talk tomorrow - OK! Thanks, bye! I want you to put it up. And then it is over. Thanks, good job. See you soon, ok? Big entrance on two. >>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW (TV) October, 10th 1991. Testimonials from Kuwait in front of The U.S. congress Human rights committee. I witnessed Iraqi soldiers Coming to the hospital. Taking babies out of their beds and Letting them die on the cold floor. Impressive pictures. Mrs. Beham, What can you tell us about it? These emotional pictures were broadcast All over America and had a strong effect on Public opinion, convincing them to go to war. And what was the point actually? - It was a total lie. The girl was the daughter of The Kuwaiti embassador. She had never been in a hospital in her life. The PR-agency ''Hill & Knowton'' sent her Contracted by the American government And she had been trained for the publicisation of that statement. Isn't this a bit sober? - Did anybody report the lie? Yes, actually.... Thanks a lot, it's been an honour, You being in our show. Thanks a lot, I hope, It will stay. Wow, that's fucking brilliant... Oh! Well, then show me. >Tv Ratings >The TV Rating Box Don't you know every porn site already? Only 5.500 homes. Can you imagine: There are only 5.500 homes With a box, taking TV ratings. That makes 13.000 people deciding, What 80 million have to watch Only 13.000. - So what? It's called statistics. And not one of these boxes is in an immigrant's home. Not a single one. Rainer, it's half past three. Yes, for sure 16:30. Thanks, Lore. Rainer! Fucking managing board. Want a coffee? - No, thanks. You, me, well ... ... I will cancel the show. Cancel it - after one show? Well, I don't decide that. The ratings were simply ... ... a catastrophe. - l saw the fucking rating, And I know, it could have been better But it's me! You should know, that with my experience, I'll get this going yeah? - Rainer, Please. You've been in this long enough. Our viewers are just An opportunistic mob. They don't want to feel small, Because they don't read good books. They just want to look at tits, And hear how to save more tax That's real life for them! Ok, well shouldn't we be using our power to help free them of this? Yes, most probably. But it isn't our job to make better people. This is a business, Rainer. This is about making money. I can't listen to this shit anymore. The mainstream's always shit and the Quality is only for the chosen few, right? Fuck. Just go down and talk to people On the street. You'll see, Nobody's as fucking stupid As the shows we are making. Then tell me who's out there buying all those Britney Spears CDs? Come on, Rainer, give it up! People only want to watch rubbish! Yeah, and this should maybe give us the idea to stop making this crap. You don't sit giving your kids Sweets all day long, do you? Ok. If you could then go and explain that to our advertising partners? ''All propaganda must be popular And needs to be adjusted To suit the least intelligent of the target audience." You know who said that? Adolf Hitler, 'Mein Kampf'. - My God, you're not going there are you!? You believe in karma, Maiwald? Rainer, please ... All of us, here in this company, Has ever respect for your work But ... - Fuck your respect! You need to control your drug problem. You perfectly know... It is only my influence... - Your influence? - ... YOU SHOULD BE THANKING ME! AFTER YOUR ACCIDENT ... - You know what Your influence is? You're turning these people into mutants! You're destroying this culture, you're destroying this society! And you couldn't give two fucks about it! Yeah What? Look at yourself, fucking tosser! - No YOU look at yourself! You have been with us From the start, you! Yeah ... but not anymore. You stupid, fucking coked up little asshole. Code word? - Country breakfast. Country breakfast? So the breast part will be... I have to do a control visit ... I've got cancer? To be honest, yes. Take a cover with us and, hm ... insect repellant. Either I have the fat extracted Or he leaves me. Love handle that is ... Look at you, fat bitch! You are way too fat, who wants ... ''The Titanic Show''. 100 candidates, one ship. Who will survive this catastrophe? The rich on the luxury deck Or the poor stuck down below? Watch the action, Survival of the fittest. Pure romance. Big Brother was yesterday! Now comes ... What's going on? I resigned. So if the ratings are false If nobody watches this shit at all, Everything is good? Problem is, one day they will get used to it. If people watch crap all the time At some point they'll WANT to watch crap. The morals of people have been so systematically corrupted That everyone thinks it is normal If there's only trash and tits And talk shows. It is a perfect system, Anna. But not for much longer... The fucking ratings are the weak spot And that is exactly where I will attack. No, the whole principle is madness. Just think about it: If someone Watches for five hours a day, they're clearly already retarded And now you think of this: These idiots watching five hours a day. These guys actually have five times More influence on the fucking ratings! ... ok, but do you know anybody, With one of these boxes at home? You see, this is it: I don't even know Anybody who knows anybody, With a ratings box and I've been Working in TV for ten years! What I'm saying is this: All the people Whose TV fees are paid for them Have no influence here at all. Wait that's at least 20% of all Germans. So all the jobless people, all students They're not included at all, right? So my producer gives me a call And says, your movie wont run There was an interruption. - What, ''interruption''? Some kind of technical interruption. TV test screen. - TV test screen? Yeah just a blank screen. But the Following day the stats say, We had 200.000 viewers Surprising how many fans you can get for a TV test screen. Sorry. You don't have to say sorry I didn't deserve anything else. >>Tragic Suicide Hey wait! Wait please! Please listen for just a minute. Your grandpa ... I am really, really terribly sorry. I'm so incredibly sorry. But now we can do something against these assholes. End the bullshit pseudo-reporting. Say, what's your name again? Pegah. Pegah? Like the flying horse? Rainer? Yes? - Good morning. Morning. - Do you maybe have a room for us? Room? l've not let rooms for a while now. Well, come in. Maybe we can work something out 19 and 20. - Thanks a lot. Hello, I'll take the tour please. Five Euros. Here we are generating the ratings and the ratings decide daily what we watch on TV And so, here is the famous lMA-Meter, It decides everything for the whole country. As you can see, it is attached To the TV-set. And it has a unique remote control. Each family member has their own respective button. Dad is button 1, Mum is button 2, Son is button 3. And even a button for guests in the house. This means: Everybody who Wants to watch TV First has to log in with this remote. Up there is a monitor where you can see the live rating. Well, I am Mama now. I'll press button number 2. As you can see here, the rating for ''Dr. Sommerfeld'' Just moved higher by a number of 15.000 spectators. This means, one single unit Represents 15.000 spectators? Exactly. - Isn't this a bit much? Are the families getting paid? No. It's all for the national good of course. Please follow me. Black trousers, brown shirt. Yes, I'm on it. Hey! Hey! Stop! Pegah, go! Go! - Stop! Don't move! This is 20.000 Volts here. Understand? - Ok. Calm down. - l am calm. What do you have under there? Show me. Put it down. - l didn't steal this. Borrowed it, right? - No. You have no clue what's going on here. This is a major conspiracy. And you have no idea. This is for the common good.Otherwise The whole world Will drown in shit. Do you know why? All because of clueless wankers like you You're just a wanker yourself you idiot! l am calling control. And they will arrest you here, you will see. - Phillip, look at me. How do you know my name? - It's on your badge. We are not criminals and you are Not one of them, I can see that. You can make this call now And everything will go under. It is like in ''Brave New World'', Only much worse. ''Brave New World'', yeah? What is that island called? ''Paradise''. The first publication? - 1932, english version. Shit, Man. And what is your purpose? Give me five minutes and I will explain it all. Only five minutes. l swear to god. Please. Get in. Phillip. Go! - Fuck! Fuck. - Control here for Phillip, please copy. Yes, this is Phillip ... l am afraid I lost him Ok, then please come back to control. - What? Hello, I can't hear you. l think my battery's dying... This thing is. Fucking place. Yes, turn right here. And there You have to turn left again, yes. We are going to my place. That's ok, isn't it? ''Brave New World'', You are saying? That's my favourite book. You live here? - Yes. Nice area. You think so? Come in. You read a lot? - Yes ... Sit down. Well ... Do you want a drink? Love to. - What? A Beer? And you? - Beer as well. Ok. >>Illuminati Murders >>The Masons among us! >>Social Anxiety l have only just sort of ... No. Get away from there. No ...uhh.. the other way. It's sort of an alarm. Uhh.. Light sensors, so... Sit down. Uhh... No, no, here. Thats my seat. So that means then, that the ratings are manipulated So then the advertisers put their adverts In all the wrong places? Forget the adverts man, That's peanuts. You have to see the big picture, Understand? it is like this: The fucking ratings only allow Programs which make you think, Buying things will make you happy. And so people are led to be mindless consumers. I have considered that before. They want to divide us. And the politicians Work together on it. In the end you have only a small elite With access to all knowledge. And power. And the rest. The great masses Will be kept stupid. And then they will tell you, The jews are responsible for everything And that we have to invade Iraq And Vietnam, Colonel Kurtz, Pope John, the first., Massacre in Armenia, Munich, Dostojewski. Good. And what is your plan? Well, first of all, we thought we get a box And check if theres even anything inside... There's stuff inside. - Really? Yes. - But what's much more important ... Is addresses. We need the addresses of all people, With these boxes at home, Then we can check, wether the ratings are real. Though I know, Your company has one of the best security systems Maybe the best in the world ... Yes, yes ... It's quite intensive, yeah. But this doesn't mean ... There is no way around it. l was in there once before. - What? You have the addresses? - Yes, Well I haven't got them here, but ... Wait a moment. So you're working On the same project as us, right? You want the same thing we want? - Don't know. Maybe a little. Awesome! So ... We group together! We are in the same team together, right? Ok? Yes, we are! You, me, Pegah! We are a team, man! And then we'll rip these fuckers a new one! Yes, ok. A team! You OK? Yeah fine, we're a team, sure. l have to go to the loo. Phillip? Phillip, are you ok? Phillip, are you ok? What is he doing? Phillip! - What? Are you ok in there? - Well, yeah ... But You have to go now, ok? OK, Let's go. Look Phillip, If I got a little over excited I'm sorry OK? I am sorry, - The door is there there's a security system you must leave yeah? Phillip, you have no idea, How important these addresses. Do me a favour, please ... - You have to go now. You ... Phillip, it's ok. - We are gone in a minute. Just give us the addresses and we're gone. My granny is here soon. - Here Phillip ... Wait I've an idea! I'll give you 500 Euro if you give me The damn addresses. My granny's got money too. - What The fuck's your granny got to do with anything? l'll give you 1.000 Euro, Damn it, man! Get out of here! Social anxiety? My whole fucking life Is fucking social anxiety. Which life? And how did your parents die? Car accident. Instantly dead. Shit. I am sorry. lt's ok. Grew up with my grandad. Perfectly ok. Only your grandad? Nobody else? Phillip? Hello. Hi. - Come in. Well, I have got ... The list. The addresses? - Yes, this is the list with all the addresses. Thats fucking great! Does this mean ... - Yeah, I am with you. Sorry, that I ... Overreacted a bit, at home, at my place. No problem. - l don't know you, You know? You never know. l ... you know and ... And then, I saw this movie, With this guy who was on this guys back all the time. But you seem to be OK. So, this is all over Germany. Helgoland, Sylt ... Sometimes it is cheaper, To go by railway ... Phillip? - And the cheap airlines these days ... - You want a beer? Yes, please. And maybe we should make A few more copies of this ... Cheers. - Cheers. Look here, the red dots Are all over Germany. Tonight we will have the proof: Nobody's watching this shit. Let's get started! Biller. - Hello, Mrs Biller. This is Lenz. I am calling from the lMA. Gunther, polling institute Emrit. Would you be so kind as to answer a few questions? Could you please switch on your TV set? Good. And could you please switch over To Arte now for the moment? Good, thanks a lot, Mr Leonhard. Good Bye. Shit. There is a sort of electrical diffusion From your TV set. Scientists have now discovered That this could be causing cancer. Could you please switch over to TTS? Ok, thanks. Thanks a lot and good bye. Shit ... Gerold. l have no idea, what you are talking about. What sort of ratings? Hmmm ... Boxes, which measure the ratings For German TV stations. You are sure? - Yes. You are here on our list. Hello, Mrs Frank, this is Lenz From the lMA. May I ask, Whether you're watching TV right now? - Yes. ''Call-in Show'' Cable 4. Ok. Could you please switch over, Just for five seconds. Good, ok. Thank you. Yes, exactly. Just change channel quickly. Why? You can switch back afterwards. That's no problem. With a concert like that You're not missing much, are you? And why is that? Because you're too Stupid to find the button, or what? Still could be a coincidence That we only picked those, Which are'nt manipulated. And, hm ... because they are simply ... Bullshit, the fucking ratings are right, man! Exactly right, precisely fucking right. l have to go for a piss, ok? - Ok. Just quickly. 15. When I was 15 ... Rainer? - Rainer! It's not like you can sleep here. - I am ok. I am ok. Come. - You are fine? Rainer? We heard it, Rainer. Yes, We heard it. Shit! Watch out. Our dearest God, you know he speaks hebrew? That's it then. We only found proof that The ratings are technically right. There is still a possibility of manipulation In the selection of the families. They are getting politically checked, For their will to consume ... I have seen the questionnaire, myself Rainer. - Come on, Phillip, fuck it! Nobody even wants to be saved from this shit. You know what we should do? We should get one pair of each kind of animal, Build a big ship and wait. The Ark?. - Noah. No, we do something quite different. We swap the boxes with tampered ones and Manipulate the ratings ourselves. We have to get 5.000 boxes, Install GSM mobile transmitters Get into the houses and swap the boxes round. Then they wouldn't react to the signal From the remote control any longer, Rather We could control it With our mobile phone signals. Technically doable, But the logistics... Why? We don't have to replace 5.000 boxes 1.000 would suffice well enough. This would give us enough influence on the Ratings. - She is right, no? Nevertheless you'd need to rob a bank first! That's not going to be a problem. I could sell my flat. Sell everything inside it. Mr Kaethner has no right to sell My things! And I will take you to court for burglary and if you do not let me down this instant then assault as well! And I could part with my baby. And who is going to go into people's homes To swap 1000 boxes over? Five million people unemployed? Sorry, just a quick question: You want a job? Sure. - Something to do with Telecommunication. However this is sheer madness. 1000 boxes! The logistics alone. Let's say We would have five workers Installing four boxes a day each. We would still need ... ... two months. - Look, that's not that bad! Each day a few households Would add to the changing ratings. Not a dramatic change. Our controls would be far less visible. - She is right. Next one, please. Hi. You are psychotherapist? No, Ha, I'd like to be one. My fucking handwriting, right? - Yes. No, PYRO-technician. What exactly Do I get for this. In cash, I mean? Well we... We thought of ... ... 1.900 Euro after tax? Oh ... Wow! Oh! l am your man! Do you know much about computers? - l sent an email once. Then they caught me at the airport Twelve years for two bank robberies Even though the weapons were only plastic! Shit. You are out on probation now? - Hm, half a year. ls this a problem? - No, not at all. Namaste. Namaste. Good, Mister ... Gopal Tscharan. Gopal Tscharan. Good, Mister Shrin. Then, hmm ... tell us Something about yourself. I am from Hadravat in lndia. There I have lived. And there I Have been building airplane parts. Five years long! machinery Machinery, machinery.

My nose full of this me silent! What should I do? In the meantime I met another woman. And she told me to come to Maibach. Ok. - A little work, If you want to give it me? Yes? Well... You know computers Technical things? Computers? I am a machine man. You show me a little Computer, And I can make Computer for you! At the moment I'm working for a telephone help line so like a One-Euro-Job. But actually I would like to do something More meaningful. You have been talking About a project which makes people Grow intellectually? Well, yeah, it is about Intellectual freedom, sort of. Yeah, great! - What kind of music do you listen to? Oldies, I used to DJ a little Way back then in a youth club. Have to say, sometimes I like to Turn the volume up, yeah. Bernd, you did telecommunication Once, didn't you? Yes, I trained at the German Telekom Communications engineering. And afterwards I was on call with the field service team. Until 1996. When they let me go. And where do you live now? - Where you found me. At the petrol station? - Yes. Hmm ... Bernd, sorry for asking, Maybe a bit embarrassing, But I have to ask you: You have a drinking problem, don't you? It's not that a big a thing. Don't worry. It is not a problem for us, I only Need to know that you are able To work. Are you ok with that? Yes, I've got it under control, really - Ok. Bernd, you have the job. And where are they supposed to live? ln a container? No, why? They can stay here in the B&B. Nobody else is living here. No, that is ... Look, that is not possible. Now this is a nice house you have got here! Beer? We need a control center You understand? Not at my place. Good. Hey man, get down! Are you crazy? Hey man, this is no problem. And then we need a gripper To strip the coax-insulation. Five times. - Everyone of the workers Needs a car of his own, And ... equipment, mobile phones etc. And finally where do you want To get the 1000 Boxen? No problem. Been researching: These boxes can be ordered In Switzerland. A little bit of money But not too much. Here is the box, Phillip! What are they doing there? - I Would like to know too. Well, let's give it a try So we will do it. - Yes, ok, let's try it. Ok, our mastermind Phillip here Has developed a plan, Allowing us to reach all of these targets Within two months. Two months? That would make it 4.16 boxes... ... a day for each of us. Good mental arithmetic, Karl-Heinz, Not bad but let's say, five a day. That's easier, so are we ok With five a day, yes? Ok, then. Your employer ... ... is called lMA. ''lnstitute for media analysis''. Get this into your heads. Very important. Ok? You visit people and tell them You are installing the latest version Of the TV ratings box. - How is this going to work, technically? Phillip will tell you about that in a minute. Ok? If some guys want to know more Or if they have any questions, you tell them To call this emergency number. This is important. The new emergency number Is on page number one of your info folder, ok? This is extremely important because if people Call the real lMA, then we Have a problem. Do you understand? - Yes. Gopal? Good. Keyword: TV Sub technician. - Technician? I am Technician No, that is just like in India, Simply the lowest class. Boys! - Ok? This is what we are fighting for. Ok? Now you are able to take on these people who look down on you Who make you feel like shit and blithely support the things that make you stay that way And really kick them in the ass. - Nice thing! This is it, right? And this thing here: It's they key. The cables are removed? - Yes, yes, yes. ''So let the earth grow Grass and herbs Let it grow And be fruitful'' lts really great, right? - Yes.

Oh yes, but you will stay a while, What's your name? ''Juergen''? l've got a good Whiskey, Juergen. You have to ... - Sorry, but I have to drive. Come on, that's not a problem. Taxis, l've got a chauffeur. But my car is out there. - So what? Voila! To us! ~For in all countries of the earth~ ~The working class has the power~ ~On the day Cologne's labourers strike~ ~And Cuba is doing the norm~ ~In Moscow they're making the weather~ ~And Peking, the college reform.~ Oh goodness I feel terrible. I have to sleep. - What? You cannot go to sleep now! Sorry, I am so tired. - And what about your driver whose taking me home? Good morning. - Hello. You are Mr Kaethner? - Yes, what is the problem? The problem is sitting in the back there. What has he done? - Mr Bauer Drove into a bus stop. That's an insurance case, isn't it? - Not with 0.8mg per mililitre it isn't. On top of that he was resisting arrest. And since Mr Bauer has no place of residence Unfortunately we'll have to take him in and arrest him. If he cannot pay for the damage, that is. And how much would the damage be? - 50.000 Euro. - 50.000 Euro for a bus stop? That thing cost at least 100.000 and that's Only the repair cost. In the end it could end up costing a bit more or a bit less. Well I can't pay that kind of money. You'll have to take him with you. Rainer, what's up? Somethings not right here... l'm hungry. He can't do this, really. I'm gone, I'm out of this. - Shit. Let him do it by himself. Fuck his revolution. How can he be that stupid? You know what this means? I am finished. I am dead! This is a fucking mess. We never should have started this With this fucking welfare crew. Never! >>Crisis Meeting >>8 o'clock Where has everyone gone? We had a meeting for 8. They're not coming any more. - I see. And why? Why's that... Because you left Bernd to hang! l didn't. There is exactly 50.000 Euro in this suitcase. But If I spend that right now, It's all over. Bernd is human And he trusted you. Bernd did a Job, And I paid him for it. ''Me! Me! Me!'' Who do you think you are? You think just because you have money You can go and buy some people Who you can send to prison for you And then turn around like its nothing? He is a human being And now he's stuck in jail! - Pegah, please. And if it was me stuck in a cell, Would you leave me hanging too? But YOU aren't stuck there. BERND is stuck there! l'm not paying this money. You can forget it. Good. Then I'm leaving too. Pegah! Pegah! Pegah, wait a minute! Maybe you are not completely wrong. Maybe you are right But please, Don't go now and Leave me in this mess. Look, I know I can be such an asshole. I know that! I don't know why! It's just a feeling that If I am not like that ... The only people who're helping you now Are people who are helplessly maladjusted, Peope who still have feelings. People who can't get along because of it in this shit world! But you couldn't give a shit! You know you need them because they are special But you cannot accept them the way the are. Sometimes I think, That if we should ever win this Then everything will be just like before Except you'll be the boss. Just fuck off. Ten. Twenty. Thirty. Forty. Fifty. In the yard, Second door to the left, You can pick him up there. Ok. Yes? - This is Harry. Karl-Heinz, is this you? Ja. - Bernd is out! - What? Since when? This morning. We're meeting later. - Ok, I'm coming. l don't believe this! Hey, this is impossible! Unbelievable! Sober again, no? It's good to have you back Hey, dafty! - Just like you. So, did you have a nice time? - Tell us everything! Come on. It's over. l have no cash left. l can't pay you any more. Rainer, we have thought about this. We go on without getting paid. But we're not going into any more houses. - The data, All the data gets forwarded to IMA From through the telephone line, right? So we hook on right there. We don't need to do home visits. Oh yeah, really? How'd you know this? All houses have a general connection That's where we connect, there is a code involved Some new system from Switzerland But Kalle can help us with that And then we can get through 7 or 8 a day. Rainer, now watch this. Simply some sort of rerouting From the individual boxes Right back to us here. And then back there again. Only we manipulate the files Before we send them back. And then the IMA gets all the Manipulated files instead of the real ones. And they have no chance to find out. It's like a delay of five milliseconds or so. Well, then ... Let's get going. Yeah! - Right! I'd knew it! Bravo! Don't get tired. - We will make it. - You bet. Ciao! - See you later! Hare Krishna! You got petrol? - Yes. - And, did you pay? No. - Why not? - The queue was too long. Well then just wait in the queue. - There was one already. Liberated households Liberated households 1, 2, 3 ... and counting... Cheers! So ... Dear friends! Gentlemen. I have to tell you this: Today at 14:36 Central european time Our computers capitulated. Oh! - Fucking shit! There was in fact a specific reason: Namely to lay down arms and work together with us. Yeah! - Wow! Cheers to mother. - Why mother? It's the alien! Computers. The bonus will be raised today. Now it is one beer per liberated household. Yeah! - Beer! A beer! Well done, man! - Cheers! No more fucking around. Your breath moves in and out Like the ocean. Your eyes are getting tired. You close your eyes. Imagine you're wandering over a green meadow. You come to a lake now. You jump into the lake ... No. no. - What do you mean, no? l can't swim. (Bernd) Ok? - (Phillip) Stop it. No, A little further back. Yes. Yeah, that's ok now. - Ok, cool. Ok. Wait a moment, it moved, Move it another 10 degrees west. So these are the live ratings. With 500 boxes we can manipulate Only the one channel, so far. No more. Do it then! - Try that one! - Ok. Which one should we use? - Which one's got the highest rating? Here, this is TTS. - And what's on there? - ''My new dream body''. God isn't that that shit with all the cosmetic surgery and shit? Fuck. Liposuction ... Disgusting! Alright, let's do it on TTS, ok? Do you mind, Rainer? - Absolutely not. Ok. One Moment. Nothing happening. Now. - Doesn't move. - It is. It moved - No, no, no. Of course, see! There! You see! It's moving! But we need another 1.000 boxes. We need another 1.000. No problem, Phillip. - Not a big deal! But that's the minimum, 1.000. - You are a genius, Phillip. Fucking great! See you later, lads! Look at this! There is the seaside! Hold me! Hold me! Gentlemen, five boxes That means five bottle of beer l'll do another one. - One for me. - One more beer. l'm sinking! l'm sinking! >>CRISIS AT TTS >>Broadcaster near bankruptcy, loses 20% per day Mr Gruendgens, do you want to comment On the TTS ratings crisis? Crisis? What crisis? - The latest Figures have been really bad! We are stll leading the market. Not like your own fucking channel. Bitch. Maiwald, I want to see you In my office within 20 minutes. I don't give a shit. Within 20 minutes. Look, Maiwald. I don't care How you improve these ratings. Just do it. The customers want better content. Thank you, thanks a lot. Ok. - You are ok? - Yes. Look, this is always the same: We once had a soap on air. A typical soap: fucking terrible actors, Story was totally predictable Cheapest of the cheap. The rating was terrible. People said: 'What a heap of shit' But we went on with the show. Day in, day out. Just continued. For six months. After three months The quota started to get better. After five months even better. And After six months people loved it. But why's that? - Because they got used to it. Understand? Habit. Habit is the biggest power on earth. You show them this shit for so long Until they only want to watch shit. And now we're twisting things round: We show them good things for long enough, Until it becomes their habit to watch good TV. - And you believe this could work? Sure! Look out, I have been working On something, sort of a concept. Shit. (Phillip) Look ... Pegah, I've got a Documentary here about ancient Egypt. You want to go for that? - Yeah, good to raise maybe 7.03% Yeah. Cool. Another thing, somehow ... Oh yeah, 0,0 percent for ''Germany's next superstar'' again. Yeah man... Down with this reality contest rubbish! ''Angst essen Seele auf' (Fear Eats the Soul) What's that then? An early film by Fassbinder. Up with that! Up with that, Phillip! Is that a teaching profession? - No, a great director, trust me. Fassbeer? (Draught Beer) - No, Fassbinder. The director. Hmm, Beer! Gopal, you crack me up! Man hunters in lndia! - Man hunters in lndia, Phillip! Man hunters in lndia! - lndia, that's out in the Himalayas. Yeah. Yeah, ok. Good. Look at this: Euro sport, they show ''American Choppers''. - What's that? Customizing cars, real big cars. Something for people into cars, bikes and stuff. Here ... this is Kl.KA! (children channel) That's ... ''Wicki and the strong guys''! Hey, Wicki! Hey, Wicki! Tie it up! Tie it up!! What's the name of the captain again? - Halva! - Halva's his name! >>Brain on, Box off >>Viewers refuse duty as idiots and force broadcasters to rethink. >>The end of TV Terror >>How the TV industry made a severe miscalculation by relying on the idiocy of it's viewers. >>The crisis of German television. >>Uprising of the enslaved spirit >>Germany tunes out >>Broadcasters in Panic, are viewers becoming more intelligent? TV has changed a lot lately, Some of my friends don't even watch it any more Others change their plans All the time because of some Terribly exciting documentary on cable one. So I guess it's time To ask the people! This is Mrs. Hagen. Mrs. Hagen, do you like the new TV programs? - Yes, it's really great. l think it's very interesting and long may it continue. I think it's fucking bullshit. Now I hardly watch anything. Me too. Yesterday I turned it on And guess what? Only these stupid black and white movies. I think the changes in TV programs are excellent. Earlier on we believed everything and anything that was shown on our television. And then we collectively discovered that it's all just rubbish thats on there. And now we find that what we watch has something to do with reality, and our lives. Many people like these changes on TV And think it's great People are starting to think again >>We are clever after all! Damn it, why the fuck haven't I got At least 20 new scripts sat waiting on my desk!? What I have, instead, are some fucking musicals. ''Medley, the musical show''. Which of you thought there was even the vaguest correlation between musicals and fucking culture!? I thought you said, we should take it easy for a while? But not for three fucking days, you asshole! Out there, people are going crazy. God knows why. Did anybody, anyone of you Think in the last while about our performance? Sure the ratings are shitty, But what exactly are we supposed to do? Something intelligent, You should do Something intelligent, for fuck's sake! You bunch of assclowns, you went to university, didn't you!? Buddhismus, Friedrich Nietzsche Comparative studies? Fuck do I know? Just give me someone who hasn't been snorting coke for ten years... That's why I want to say, We should be very aware That this so called "Intellectual Awakening" Is only weakening an economic growth that is already very poor. Of course it is a positive trend, Our children will be comparatively Better in school. But at what price? Consumer electronics alone The computer game industry, Production has fallen by almost a third. What, I am asking myself, what else has to happen? Before Germany finally wakes up? Thank you very much. Thanks a lot. Miss Moll is here. Let her in. Anna! How are you doing? You look gorgeous. - Thanks. It's a real pity that we don't have The time to meet more often. Come on. Let's sit down. Now tell me, how's things? Great! Our new literature show, its doing great. - Sorry? Which one? ''Hit and Read''. We have VIPs Throw darts at book covers. And whatever they hit, they have to read. Great idea. Sounds brilliant! You want a drink? - No, thanks. Oh and actually, how Rainer doing? Have you heard anything? No, quite a while since the last time. Why are you asking? Oh, nothing really.. Well, he was a .. was a friend, right? He was very much into this whole ratings thing before he dissapeared. Do you know anything? Hey I'm calling because you ... You have that system, That locates mobile phones. Cheers! To Pegah, guys! Hey. Ok. Slowly. Ok, ok, ok. You go first. Carefull, there's a small step here. Two ... And ... Three. Yeah! We are in Berlin now, Warsaw bridge, let's see, What this cheeky Berliner has to say About our new television. Well for example: Yesterday I saw this lnterview, well sort of a discussion Running much longer than usual. Well, I liked it. Can you just once: give me a big, loud applause? Please? That's it then. Televison now has the tendency To replicate reality, To be a picture of reality. This is the original purpose of media: Mediate and moderate. and thus we are set free. We can breathe And live our lives. A few months ago I watched TV At this time of the day And today I am going out for A walk along the river. Fuck the ratings! Fuck the ratings! >>reading in the light over gawping in the dark >>Intellectual Spring in Germany Hello? Yes? I'll take care of this. Rainer! Long time no see! You look good. Five years younger. Temper seems gone? What do you want? Let me say just one thing Rainer: Respect What a great setup. Really, what you have done here, I wouldn't have thought you capable of. I'm warning you, don't fuck with any of this. - Cool down, Rainer, cool down. One call from me and all of you Go to prison. Understand? Oh my god, Rainer! Was it worth it? Well, I ... I mean was it really worth Throwing away your career? Selling your house? What for? To prove TV makes you stupid? Pff, Tell us something we don't know! Look, twenty years ago: People got upset About deforestation They went on street protests for peace in Vietnam. These days it's all about the asses of Brad Pitt and Paris Hilton. And you know what? They think it's super! They don't miss anything. You started a ... ... Trend... Yeah, so what? People chatted a little about books Like they did about TV before. But do you honestly believe That you can change their nature? Maiwald. - Who is Maiwald? That's his car, isn't it? I'll fucking burn it out! Harry, stop it! Calm down ... That's just the old food chain, Rainer. The whole shit in the 60ies, Almost ruined us all. There can only be one on the top of the chain. The rest have to be kept busy. And that's not so simple. Television gave us the best stability. We've ever had yet. People stay at home They don't get any radical ideas. We're not fucking society up, Rainer. We're the good guys, we do good things. You fucking fascist. That is stupid. Madness, Rainer. So silly. There is no difference anymore Between state, media, Religion, politics, science Economy, Just one little machine for all of humanity. People have work and everything else Is here in this box. You better get the fuck out of here before I sort you right out! Do you really believe, I'll let you ruin my career? Here's the deal: You go on With your glorious plan as before, Only the TTS rating goes up by 10 percent Within the next twenty days. For that I will finance all of this. 100.000 Euro for each percent. You start right now or I report you Right away. You choose. Oh, by the way! Greetings from Anna. She is doing very well. Good morning! I vote we continue. Let's give him his fucking ratings. I don't trust him. He's something up his sleeve. He will report us as soon as He's the boss of the broadcaster. True. We should not give in to this rat. I don't think so. If we would do this now, He's just as guilty as us We can document everything. Guys how can we put quality programmes and trash TV together? We're betraying our own ideology. But we need the cash. One million, guys, one million! New cars! Computers! Money is always the beginning of the end for revolution. Good morning, Lore. - Morning, Boss. How was the weekend? - Well ... Good! And you? Wonderful, really wonderful! My boat has got a new engine, And now it tears through the water. Gorgeously. So these are the weekend's ratings? That bad? Please connect me to the Minister of the interior. - Yes. Oh, and Mr Gruendgens Wants to talk to you. I was expecting that. Tell our chairman, I will meet him At half past nine. Please don't disturb me until then. Close the door! - Yes. Maiwald, I am sorry, but You know how things work. The ratings over the past few months are simply a catastrophe. Things are not as they appear. Rainer Kaethner, You remember him? He ... is leading a group of saboteurs. They manipulate the ratings. But please! - I don't know, how they do it. But... Maiwald! Pull yourself together. We are not in one of your shows. Come on. Take it like a man. You haven't adapted to this new spirit among our viewers, and so it falls on me To make a decision. Otherwise it would be me for the chop. You know how things are. Maiwald. With our redundancy payment you can make a proper new start. Didn't you have that boat? What was the name? ''Lissy''? Go and have a nice holiday You look like you need it. ''Lucy''. - Maiwald! The boat is called ''Lucy'', You stupid wrinkly fuck! I will uncover the whole story And you'll be left to clean toilets. Corrupt asshole. Bootlicker. Enter. Morning! Anyone for coffee? Double or two single beds? It's all empty upstairs. All empty. What do you mean, ''All empty''? We have to be out of here in two days My uncle is coming back. I can take two guys to stay in my bus. Not important. Point is, we have to get back up and running again. Phillip, we have to work on the system. Get things working. We'd get discovered now, right away. - We cannot stop now. We haven't done it long enough. - They'll find us in three minutes. And that's it then. All over. At least we tried. And what did we achieve? Complete waste of time. Like trying to warm a city in winter with a cigarette lighter. As senseless as that. Idiotic. I feel like an ass. What have you got there? Todays? - Yes. Phillip, look at this. - What is it? - This is from today. Impossible. Todays? - Yes. >>The ratings revolution continues. Holy shit! - This can't be true! 18,7 percent! - That's the shit, You wanted to see! Yes, that's it! You can watch it yourself! What's going on? - People still Watch the quality stuff, Even though we stopped manipulating The ratings a week ago. Oh really! Damn it, we did it! Shit, man, I knew this, People aren't that stupid! I knew they weren't that stupid! Look at this, man! Rainer, what are you saying? We should go on, right? - Yes. Hassloch. Hassloch! Hassloch? Its a town in Rheinland Pfalz With a typically average and Representative German profile. People buy everything with a chip card. And everything that will be sold in Germany Will be tested in Hassloch first. Get the idea? Here they decide what is Going to be produced and sold in the future. Harry, how much is this? 1,39 Euro, Gopal. - Thanks. 4,95, please. Thanks. That's 7,80 all together. And the bottle Is on the house. I am the house. 35,95, please. - I only got 20. Whatever. I'll take it. But I need your chip card before you go. >>Delete -- Diet Pills
