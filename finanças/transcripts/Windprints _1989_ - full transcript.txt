[SHOUTING] Seems that stuff I filmed yesterday attracted the wrong attention. Yeah, I know. And it's bad news, man. If any of those guys get arrested as a result of your film, you can forget about working in the townships again. Hey, I just filmed it. I didn't make it happen. You can't just film anywhere you like. Those people trusted you. That's why they allowed you in there in the first place. Thozamile, somebody was killed. Now what am I supposed to do? Just stand there and watch? It's my job to get the story. Then tell the whole story. What do those millions of viewers across the world see? Yet another example of black on black violence. Now, is that the story you want to tell? No, but it happens. Of course it happens. But then it happens for a reason. And it's your duty to point that out. Look, I record what I see as objectively as possible. That's easy for you to say. [SIGHING]You're not the one who's having his head kicked in. But then, you're only there because you're paid. Oh, don't give me that crap! The last four years I've been shot at, tear-gassed, stoned, arrested, beaten up. Welcome to South Africa. Except I can't go home to the safety of my white skin at the end of the day. Jesus, Thozamile! What is this? I care about this country just as much as you do. Then wake up, man! Stop hiding behind your camera! Get involved! You have the power to tell the real story about this country. [PHONE RINGING]Not just sensational bullshit. Otherwise, you are no different from your Boer brothers who are causing the shit in the first place!

Because you people are the fucking cause of this now. Uh, we're not the cause of this. POLICEMAN: Man, don't... Don't come and talk shit to me now. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] The police were in here this afternoon. They want to know what the hell happened out there. [PEOPLE CHATTERING]What did you tell them? Oh, I bought us some time. You have to leave town while I do some fancy footwork and placate some ruffled feathers. And save both our asses. God knows I've done it before. I'm sending you to Namibia for a couple of days. Charles Rutherford is looking for a cameraman. What? You must be joking! That old soak hasn't seen any real action since the war in Zimbabwe. Listen, he may not be your style, but he survived 20 years in this business. CHARLES RUTHERFORD: Eighteen months ago, Nhadiep killed his first victim in this dusty sheep farming area of South West Africa. Today, he struck again, killing two farm laborers. He only seems to go for his own tribespeople.Between these attacks, Yeah.he's left a trail of devastation with five dead and scores maimed and wounded. The local police have mounted an extensive hunt for Nhadiep over the past two years, or how he selects his targets. But this elusive renegade has become so good at avoiding capture that he's become something of a legend amongst his own people. The Nama. Charles Rutherford, VisCom News, Namibia. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [STATIC CRACKLING ON RADIO] [SCANNING RADIO] MAN ON RADIO: Seven-ninety-five. WOMAN: So you're not joking. [RADIO CHANNEL CHANGES] [MAN SINGING] [RADIO CLICKS OFF] [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] [INSECTS CHIRPING] HELMUT: Hey, who's this? Hi, Sarge! How's it? [PLATVOET SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Oh, keeping well, are you? [LAUGHING]Oh, terrible, man, terrible. Yes, Charlie? It's a bit hot today, huh? What are you doing here? Local air traffic controller as well, now? No, just checking up on you. You know you can never trust an Englishman. So I hear that new boytjie of yours is filming riots and stuff in Soweto, eh? Must be interesting. I'd like to hear some of his stories. Bit of a sensitive subject right now. I wouldn't mention it if I were you. This is meant to be a break for him. [LAUGHING] Ja,Prince Charlie. It's good to sweat. Maybe it'll make a man out of him. Hello, Anton. Welcome. Long time no see.Hi. Hello, hello, hello there. Helmut Schadeberg.Right, hello. Sergeant du Plessis. But call me Platvoet. Welcome to South West. Anton van Heerden.An Afrikaner? I was beginning to believe all newsmen were a bunch of foreigners. I hear you were checking out Kaffirs knocking each other up in Soweto? Uh, Charlie here said I should ask you. This, believe it or not, is the local expert on Nhadiep. Little wonder that they haven't been able to catch him. [CHUCKLING]Don't you believe a word he says, Anton. This is Joey, who's our guide. And interpreter when he's not drunk as a skunk. Hi, Joey.He'll do anything you ask, except work. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Ah, I must get going. Listen, if you have any trouble with this Englishman just call me. [CHUCKLING] Bye, guys. Anton, you see all these farms here? Because of Nhadiep. We just can't find Namas to work on these farms anymore. They're too scared of Nhadiep. And, you know, without boys nothing is possible. What interests me is that the Nama believe that he's magical. He's indestructible. Believe that he can change himself into a rock or the wind. Anything he likes. HELMUT: Yeah. But to them, anyone who can run away from the white man for so long [LAUGHING]must be a magician. Tell me, have you been to South West before? Namibia! Uh, Namibia, um... Call it what you like. The Bushmen call it, [CHUCKLING]"the land God created in a temper." What the Bushmen meant was "The arsehole of the universe." HELMUT: Is that why you're passing through it, hey, Charles, eh? [LAUGHING] Oh, Charles, you're just jealous because you haven't got a desert in England, eh? [LAUGHING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] HELMUT: All right? Yeah. Karen. Karen! Well, here we are. Nhadiep country. [INSECTS BUZZING] Hang on. Karen! Karen! [MEOWING] My mother's coming. [CAT MEOWS] [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Oh, Ma. [CAT MEOWS] And where do you think you're going? Missis? Round the back, man! They pretend they're so stupid. Believe me, they know bloody well. [CAT MEOWING] Ah, well, here we are. Nothing fancy.Ah. This is fine. Uh, now, if you need anything else, you just speak to my wife. She runs the place. [CHUCKLING]I only look after the bar. Okay.Thank you. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [ROOSTER CROWING]Hello. Morning, Joey. JOEY: Hello, boss. Tell me, Joey, do you know Nhadiep? I never met him, boss. Joey, do me a favor. Please don't call me "boss." Do you believe he has magic? Sorry, boss? Well, do you believe he can fly with the wind? Change into things. Stuff like that? They tell me so, boss. Do you think they're going to catch him? Who can catch him? Nobody. He's like a rabbit. He runs here, he runs there. Nobody can catch him. You can't catch the wind. Never. Never. [BIRD CHIRPING] MARIE: It's not that I believe all those stories that the Namas say about Nhadiep, that he can turn himself into a stone or a bird or whatever. But take the night he shot Klaus. That's the--the Nama that worked for us for 22 years. My husband was in town with the police. Somebody had heard that they'd seen Nhadiep in town. And that same night, Nhadiep shot Klaus right here on the farm, while my husband was in town looking for him. And how do you explain that? My husband says... You mustn't put this on TV. My husband says the Namas are so lazy that if they don't want to work they'll see Nhadiep everywhere. [LAUGHING] No, please, go on. But it's, um... It's getting very hard for us. You know, um, I suppose it's because even though you know it's a lot of nonsense, you start believing those stories yourself about Nhadiep. Um... The whole time you get this feeling that... That he's watching you. I'm... I get worried about my husband going into the mountains. I always think that Nhadiep is going to shoot him. Not that he's ever shot a white. I just wish they'd hurry up and find him, because it gets on my nerves, I don't... I mean, otherwise I don't know what's going to happen to us. [SOBBING] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] OTTO: You want to know about this bloody Nhadiep? I'll tell you, he's nothing but a rapist, man, a sex maniac. You know, I reckon he'll kill anybody just for the bloody hell of it. We used to always say, just let the terrorists come down here to the south and we will sort them out, eh. But now, here's this madman going around killing people and we can't do a thing, hey, Sarge? One hotnot with a gun and he's got to get the army in to get us out. ROOTMAN: No, he's got to make a mistake. Then we'll get him. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS]I can tell you that much. When?Right now! ROOTMAN: We'll get him. Don't you worry. [PEOPLE LAUGHING] [SIGHS] HELMUT: No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't, please. Helmut. [WHISTLING] CHARLES: Come on, Anton...ANTON: Oh no, no, no...

[SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] [SINGING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] JOEY: Morning, boss. Morning, Joey. You looking for me, boss?No. Is this your family?This is my sister's family. This is my mother's sister. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]Hello. And this is my sister. [PEOPLE APPLAUDING] [NEIGHING] [ACCORDION MUSIC PLAYING] KLAUS: Oh, Charles. Well, hello there. Welcome, welcome. Glad you could make it. CHARLES: Well, happy birthday, Marianne.Thank you. Do come in. Come and join the party. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SHOUTING IN AFRIKAANS] ROOTMAN: Charles, Anton... [ALL LAUGHING]And, uh, how's your head this morning, mate? Charles, let me introduce you to our local Member of Parliament, Meinert. How do you do?So, you're making a film about Nhadiep. If the man exists. I'm beginning to have my doubts. And this is his cameraman, Anton van Heerden. Pleased to meet you. Thank you.Welcome. Welcome. Sorry, uh, this is Henning. CHARLES: Charming.KLAUS: Don't worry about him. This business of Nhadiep is a very touchy subject around here. Man, he's just being bloody difficult. Well, that may be so, but I reckon he's got a lot of sense, you know. While the rest of the farmers are selling up, he's busy buying. Anyway, a drink.Yeah. You see, you have these, uh, people of the media going around saying Nhadiep is a victim of apartheid. Complete nonsense. It--it just isn't the case, you see, listen... It's over there, okay?Yeah. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] [LAUGHING] You know, you guys must come and film on my farm. Nhadiep shot one of my shepherds there last year. And now I can't get boys to work there anymore. You know, I stopped counting, but I... [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] I'm afraid my Afrikaans is very bad. Look, that Kaffir has cost us more than the whole drought. Now, you want to make a bloody film about him. Well, the film is actually about the manhunt... Wouldn't you rather make a film about your own people? Us. The farmers. Or, aren't you interested in your own people anymore? [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Those whites that wanted to go, they've gone long ago. And those that wanted to stay, like me, [STUTTERING] we're here. We're accepting the situation as it is, right now. I mean, we--we can't just up and leave and run off to South Africa. There we don't know who's who. Who are we chasing? ROOTMAN: Nhadiep's been shooting at Henning's farm. Let's go. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO] [ALL CHATTERING IN AFRIKAANS] Gone with the wind again. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] [ENGINE STARTING] [SIREN WAILING] It's amazing nobody was killed in here. Pieterse, Namibian Herald, how's it? Anton van Heerden, VisCom News.Hi. It's all because of that baby that this has happened, you know. What? That woman out there with the kid. Who do you think is the father? Go and ask the big white boss what happened here. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] What the hell do you think you're doing? Get on, get off! This is private property. No one asked you to film here.What's going on here? Come on, get off my farm, you vultures. Come on, you've got no business here. Take it easy.Get off! Come on, Anton. [BABY CRYING] Oh, for Christ's sake. Get in! [GUN FIRING] [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS]Okay. Joey! [TWIGS SNAPPING] [LAUGHING] Nothing better than a lekker boskak. Once he gets into the mountains you can forget about it. Do you think he's still around? Don't worry about Nhadiep. He doesn't kill whites. He's just killing his own people. He could have killed me a long time ago if he wanted to. Many times. Nhadiep! I'll get you! [LAUGHING] All these helicopters and fancy night vision and what have you... Doesn't help you. Nothing. If you really want to catch this guy, you'll have to do it with a bit of luck. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] He's laughing at them. You must know him quite well by now.Hell, man, I've thought more about him over the last 18 months than I've thought about my own wife. You know, you feel so small when you've come back after weeks in the mountains people point at you and they say, "You too stupid to catch him, eh?" You know, often I'd find his tracks. And he'd been watching me the whole time. He's a clever little hotnot. Did you know he can write? Was... Only was in school for two years. But he writes poems and that. [INSECTS CHIRPING] [PANTING] [BLEATING] NHADIEP: "Just inside, full of surprise "And then, suspicion "Reach, stand still "Reassure me, please "Just beginning Still beginning" Probably not the right time to tell you, old cock, but the water here is not unrelated to the stuff that they flush down the lavatory. If I were you I'd stick to the beer. [SPITTING] So, what do you think? This half-beast, half-man will-o'-the-wisp legend of the South, it seems he also writes. Though I'd hardly call him Byron. Ah, give him a break. He only spent two years at school. But then Byron didn't run with the wind and fly with the clouds. Do you think he's politically motivated?God, no. No leader of man. Far too individual for that. There's integrity in what he does. A sense of Adam imbued with primitive, original rage. Oh, I think I would have enjoyed hanging out with him in the '60s. [LAUGHING] "When freedom is outlawed, "only the outlaws will be free." Nhadiep is a classic outlaw. Frankly, I think the Namas just love his ability to avoid capture. I'm famished. You coming?Yeah, I won't be long. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Thank you. NURSE: This way. Granddad. Come, the TV is here. Do up your shirt man! [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Sit up. There you go. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Shame. He has a headache. But he's tough. He'll get better quickly. [NURSE SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] He says he didn't do anything to upset Nhadiep. He doesn't know why he shot him. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] He's still a bit confused. Maybe you should speak to Jantjie. Or Ouboet. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] [PEOPLE LAUGHING] CHARLES: Are they both victims of Nhadiep? Yes, and there are some more in the ladies' ward. Charles, let's just get a shot of him. Forget the interview. Oh, fine, okay. That's fine. Don't worry about this. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] What? [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Charles, he said something about the woman on the farm being Nhadiep's woman. Hannes, is that his child? Oh, come on, for Christ's sake, get the shot before he falls to pieces completely. Perhaps we can get to Nhadiep through her. Oh, be sensible. He's not going to waste his time with women and children. Well, we've screwed that one. So, who's next? PIETERSE: This is what the government set aside as a farming reserve for the Nama. Can you believe it? CHARLES: How could you possibly farm here? It gives new meaning to getting blood out of a stone. Yeah, the Nama used to rule the whole of Southern Namibia, man, now they got this. CHARLES: Unbelievable. Which one's Nhadiep's father? You okay?ANTON: Yep. Rolling. In a country with such a diversity of people and culture and after nearly a century of colonial rule, Nhadiep has become everyman's legend. A murderer, a liberator, mystic, a hero. And though his real motives remain a mystery, to many he has come to personify the lost freedom of the Nama whose territory this was before the imposition of German rule and the historical successor, South Africa. Cut. Right then, here we are. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] You got it?Cheers. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS]Yes, here's to Nhadiep. Long may he live. Though I doubt it. Why? Because he's got no guilt. Whereas a common criminal may well surrender, go quietly. Not Nhadiep. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] What? Because maybe he's just a madman with a gun, going around killing people for the hell of it. And here we are turning him into some kind of legend. Well, who cares? So long as his acts of violence threaten the very basis of society, there's still hope for change. Ma! What? He may not come in here. There is a bar for coloreds in the back. Oh, for God's sake. Hello. Ma! Time to leave, chaps. He can't drink in here. Look, he's a friend of mine. I don't care if it is the State President's friend. They've got their own bar. Come! Can you give me a ride? Of course. Sorry about that. Don't let it bother you. I should have realized. KAREN: Come and look here, Charles. Look. And I'm telling you now in plain English, no Kaffirs and hotnots in here. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] And I don't care what people say. Extraordinary. The English language will never be the same. Where are you going? Back to my fellow lepers. Ah.Are you coming? No, I'll stay here, keep the peace. Fuck her. I'd rather not, thank you. Hey. What are you doing?Sorry. Sorry. [URINATING] [HONKS] Ma! [HONKING] [DOG BARKING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] You sure I'm allowed in here? Maybe it's my turn to get kicked out. You should be so lucky. No, they're just grateful that a white man should bother to come in here in the first place. What are you gonna have?Oh, this is on me. I owe you one. [WHISTLING] Andy, two cold ones, bro. Why are there no Namas in here? Well, nothing's stopping them, but apartheid is a contagious disease. Monkey see, monkey do. See, us colored people, we're far too in with the whites to mix with Namas. Cheers. Cheers. Listen, you guys better be careful about over-romanticizing Nhadiep. Don't forget one thing. He kills Namas, not whites. Some people around here, I guess they like that. What do you mean? Do you really think Nhadiep could get this far without protection from the whites? How do you think he manages to disappear every time they're hunting for him without a trace? Where does he get his guns from, his bullets? Well, he steals them, obviously. And what about the girlfriend on the farm, hmm? And do you know that Nhadiep sends his grandfather money at the end of every month? What about that? What are you saying? I'm saying that maybe somebody is paying Nhadiep a salary. What, to kill Namas? Listen, bushman hunting used to be a sport around here not so long ago. The only difference is now they've hired a black man to do it for them. Who's gonna pay him? Oh, you guys, man, you're walking around here in a daydream. Look, all I'm gonna say is that there are some people, white people, who are buying up these farms very cheap now thanks to Nhadiep. That makes Nhadiep into a mercenary. With both hands in the cookie jar. But, please, don't let these little details spoil your movie, huh? Yeah, I used to believe in Nhadiep's power and his magic. Once. Excuse me. Very good shot. Come on. I saw what you were doing there. You and that colored man. Ow! Oops. That wasn't funny, stupid. Thought you were ready. Come on, old cock, cheer up. Nobody really knows anything about Nhadiep, not even his own family. Everybody seems to be making up willy-nilly as they go along. Including you? Including me. Well, maybe it is true. Maybe Nhadiep is just a mercenary. Why not? God knows it won't be the first time this sick society has created a monster like that. Come on, show me a country that hasn't had its own share of violence. And believe me, I've seen most of them. All this because some bastard wants to buy farms cheaply. Henning. Oh, forget it. Of course, Charles. Who else is buying up farms around here? And why was he so keen to get us away from his farm? Because he allows Nhadiep to hide there, that's why. And that explains the woman. Well, put two and two together. Hang on, you don't even know for sure that she's Nhadiep's girl. Well, maybe Nhadiep's been blackmailed. The baby. Henning's using the baby to get Nhadiep to do those things. Anton, the baby's only about six months old. Nhadiep's been killing for nearly two years. Well, everyone else is making up their version of him. [CHARLES LAUGHING] Can I help? Hello. We're the film crew. I called you a few days ago. Ah, yes. Hello. Come to film our little ceremony? Well, yes, and to see if you've changed your mind about giving an interview on Nhadiep. We've read some of his writings and we find it very hard to believe that he was at school for such a short time. Yes, well, we must remember that he was 12 when he started. But he was a bright boy, definitely. What was he like? Very quiet. Though he had a terrible temper. He used to bite the other boys sometimes. But can I offer you a drink? Oh, that would be lovely.Sit, please, sit. Thank you. I'm sure our gallant warriors won't miss a few. Why does he attack only his own people? You know much about the Nama people, Mr... Van Heerden, Anton. And no, not much. The Namas are a proud people, Mr. Van Heerden. I suspect Nhadiep finds it very hard to accept what's happened to his people over the years. Their humiliation, subservience. So, he hits out at his own people. I suppose it's like hitting somebody you love when it's yourself you feel angry with. I was told he was being paid to kill Namas. You hear so many stories these days, Mr. Van Heerden, that you hardly know which one to believe. Well, what about... What about the woman and baby on Henning's farm? We were there after the last shooting. Marta? You know about her? Yeah, this business about the baby must have broken his heart into a thousand pieces. Poor man. What business? Look, as I've said, you don't know what to believe any longer. But you must excuse me now, please. If our warriors don't get their drinks soon, I'll have a real war on my hands. The interview? No, no, no, please, later perhaps. But, good luck with your film. Maybe it will really put this place on the map for a change. CHARLES: [CHUCKLING] Yes, maybe. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] MAN ON MEGAPHONE: Remember our great leader who tried to unite the people of Namibia against the foreign occupation of our land. Remember also those who died for our country. We greet them with the following words, "We salute you and all our forefathers "who bravely resisted colonial rule "and died for the liberation of our country. "We know that the struggle will be long "and that some will fall by the wayside. "But we, the younger generation, promise today, after 100 years, "that we will continue with the struggle "until the bells of independent Namibia are rung one day." [GUNS FIRING] [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [BRASS BAND PLAYING] [WOMAN SHOUTS] [CHEERING] Great stuff, this, eh? The more the day wears on, the more difficult it becomes to tell the difference between the Germans and the Namas. Yeah, and the more history gets rewritten. Why not? History is what you make it, my friend. I see that Charles has found some soul mates. Real colonial relics, that bunch, man. [PLAYING AFRICAN POP MUSIC] CHARLES: I don't like this. Henning might leave the pageant early. ANTON: Don't worry. We're white, we're protected. What? Last time he nearly shot us. Look, I just want to ask somebody if that's Nhadiep's baby. [BIRDS TRILLING] Come back here! [HORN HONKING] He's not here. Thank you very much. Get in! ANTON: We're onto something here, Charles. CHARLES: You can't just barge into people's houses. Okay, relax. No harm done. He could have arrived while you were in there, for Christ's sake! Then I would've asked him what the hell's going on. Charles! If Marta is Nhadiep's lover, and that's his child, we can prove Henning's using him. Why did he try and kill her? I don't know. Let's go and find out. Nobody is going to hire a hitman so they can buy a couple of farms cheaply. It's suicide. [WATER RUNNING] You've made no effort to get Nhadiep's side of the story. Nothing. Now, if you want to understand this country, you'd better get to the heart of the story. I can't afford to hide behind ethics and search warrants. What I report is more than news, Charles. It's my life, it's my future. How you deal with your guilt is your business. But at this minute you're working for me and I expect at least some pretense of objectivity. Your problem is that you avoid the truth. It upsets your comfortable little movies. The truth? What do you mean by the truth? Your determination to hold Henning responsible for Nhadiep not turning out the way that you want him to seems a very curious perception of the truth to me, if you don't mind me saying so. I don't know, Charles. I live here, you don't. NHADIEP: "Nothing "Nothing matters "My body, nothing "Departed to death "In you I saw an excellent wife "But there was something wrong with you spiritually "Now I shall see that things turn out as I want them "Now I shall see that things turn out as I want them" Thanks. [SNORTING] [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Could I speak to your daughter, please? [IN AFRIKAANS] I understand. I won't be long. Thank you. [BABY COOING] Marta? [MARTA SPEAKING AFRIKAANS] Please don't be frightened. I just want to talk to you about Nhadiep and the baby. Get away from that baby! [BABY CRYING] [BABOON SCREECHING] What are you doing here, Van Heerden? I told you. We're doing a film on Nhadiep. Yeah, so what do you want from my people? What have these Kaffirs been telling you? [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] They haven't told me anything. [MARTA SCREAMING] What are you doing? Are you crazy? Yeah, Van Heerden, I'm crazy. I suppose they told you that I paid Nhadiep to kill all those Kaffirs. You're gonna kill him! Bleeding lies! All bloody lies! He was killing long before I bought those farms. Look, I came here because I thought she might be Nhadiep's woman. No other reason. He wishes. He's too busy believing that story that he's a hero or something. But, here on my farm, he's only another hotnot. [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] So you are hiding him here. I wasn't hiding him. I mean, nobody tells Nhadiep what to do. But you allow him to stay here. To make sure he's not caught. Maybe I didn't see him. I mean, how must I know what my Kaffirs are getting up to? And meanwhile you're just buying up farms. You newspeople... You know fuck all! Why don't you... Why don't you fuck off back to Soweto, that's where you belong. You're not one of us anymore! [MARTA SCREAMING] [BABY CRYING] [GRUNTING] [BABOON SCREECHING] [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] [GROANS] Watch it! [GRUNTS] Nhadiep! Stop! [YELLING IN AFRIKAANS] [PLATVOET SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] [PLATVOET IN AFRIKAANS] Damn it! [YELLING IN AFRIKAANS] [GUN FIRING] CHARLES: Anton!

[IN AFRIKAANS] [LAUGHING] Yeah, Nhadiep, just you and me, till the end, eh? [LAUGHING] [GUN FIRES] Fuck you! [LAUGHING] Get away from there, Van Heerden. PLATVOET: I said get away! [HONKING] [PEOPLE YELLING] PLATVOET: Go on. Go on. Keep off, keep off, keep off. Go on. [PLATVOET SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Hey, Platvoet! [POLICEMAN SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] [IN AFRIKAANS] Right, let's see, let's see if you got the right man here. [ALL CLAMORING] All right? You do it. MAN: Go, go, go, go. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Get out! Get out! Out, out! PIETERSE: Anton, are you okay? Hey, what happened out there, man? CHARLES: Joey, what are they saying? Come on, man, wake up. She is saying, "Where is his face?" What?Nhadiep has been shot in the face, Charles. She's saying that if it's Nhadiep, then where is his face? PIETERSE: See, some people don't believe it's Nhadiep. They think someone else has been shot to try and trick them into going back on to the farms. Oh, give me a break. [MEN CHATTERING] OFFICER: Sergeant. Fuck you, Henning. [BRASS BAND PLAYING] Many people have asked what prayers can be spoken at the grave of such a man. [TRANSLATOR SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Friends, Nhadiep is today being buried as a black man. Not because he killed [TRANSLATING IN AFRIKAANS]or he stole or hurt. But in recognition of the resistance he gave to the colonizers of our land. For reminding us of our strength, our spirit our glorious past. Let us sing. [ALL SINGING IN AFRIKAANS] I'm going back to Henning's farm. Anton! I have to go, Charles.What the hell for? To find Marta and the baby. Why aren't they here? And Gerrit.What do you mean? I think they're in danger. Maybe Nhadiep stole that pistol, but maybe Henning gave it to him. The only people who know are those two. Anton, leave that to the police. I can't. Not now, not after this. If it wasn't for me, Nhadiep might still be alive. No, no, no, no, that was inevitable. Please drop it. That's exactly what Henning expects me to do. That's why people like him have power in this country. [ENGINE STARTS] Don't expect me to come with you. I don't. God, you angst-ridden Boers can be a pain in the arse. I'm not a Boer. I'm an Afrikaner. Well, if you have to go, go. But for God's sake, watch your back. I don't want to attend another funeral. Go on, then. [FLIES BUZZING] [IN AFRIKAANS] [BIRDS TWITTERING] What's it, Mummy? You're in shit, Van Heerden! What do you want here? [SPEAKING IN AFRIKAANS] Where is Marta? Don't worry about my people. I do with them what I like. Same as I did with Nhadiep. You used him.What? You fucking used him.Jesus. You know nothing about him. I brought him out of the mountains. I showed them he's no good. The Namas think he's powerful but I proved he's a real person. None of this magic business. But then he mustn't fuck with me. I tamed him and I fucking broke him. Stay where you are. Are you gonna shoot me? Why don't you fight me like a true Afrikaner? [YELLING] [GROANS] [LAUGHING] HENNING: Come on! [GROANING] HENNING: Stand up! [PANTING] What do you want from me? What did I do to you? You don't understand. He came to me because... Oh, fuck it. I tried to stop this thing. I understood him. They think he's something great. But he's nothing. That's the problem. I let him stay to show he's just a hotnot. Problem is now he can be anything. Even magic. Why do we fight? We Afrikaners must stick together.
