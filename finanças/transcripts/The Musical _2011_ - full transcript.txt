Subtitles by DramaFever Last Episode Do Hwa! Do Hwa look at this! This is it! Grandpa wanted blue! I wanted to give this to you first. Why me? If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even gotten here. And... And? When I first saw you, I had this color in my head. Five hundred years ago. You still remember that you had given me the same handkerchief... For a long time has passed, for me to get it. I have come through time of millenium, I now live here. All the time I have endured. I was alone. I wasn't allowed to fall in love. I didn't love anyone. But I, since the first time I saw you, the times has stopped and love has grown. Love longer and lonelier than 1000 years. Weren't you the lead actress for Count Monti today? Yes, but... You! You didn't just let me down. You have abandoned your stage. I'm sorry. But this is also a stage that I'm responsible for. It was your decision to become my sub, after throwing away Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails. You really are selfish. -Kang Hee... -You just do whatever you like? It's not like that. You thought that if you barged in here and sing, Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails will win? So that they can put up the show? And then you could come back as my sub? Kang Hee... I just came here once... You won't get either of them. And you will live a life that has nothing to do with musicals. Kang Hee... I will make that happen. When you broke your promise with me and with your stage, you must have prepared for this at least. Kang Hee, can you just... They do not have rights to show Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails. You know already don't you? I was going to be the lead actress for that piece. Yu Jin was going to do the production. Really?! So they don't have the rights for the show? They have already sold the piece to another company. But now they are trying to show it after a minute change in the settings. If Bae Kang Hee is one of the judge, it's over. We don't even have to wait. Let's pack up. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. No, it's not. Wasn't she kind of cool back there? Her dramatic appearance? I thought it was a movie. Regardless of what the outcome is going to be, let's eat first! Thank you! Whether we get sponsored by DIMP or not, we can still put up the show somehow. So let's all cheer up! Yeah! We need to add up the points then. Excluding the piece that wasn't supposed to be shown. We just got this fax. It's documents that you have requested at Seoul. Hold on. This is the release term contract of the Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails to Gu Jak Company. What? Yu Jin. After the show won the contest for Amour Fund, we were going to perform with them. The show was postponed for internal reasons, so we gave the rights to Gu Jak Company. Is that true? So there is no issue with the rights then? It's been some time, I wasn't sure if we still had documents for it. I just checked and found them. It's good. Hey! What? What? Yes? We won. What? We got first place. We can put up the show. And we're going to New York! Good. Congratulations. Be careful on your way back. Hong Jae Yi! Go Eun Bi! Hong Jae Yi. Can't you say hi? Let's go back to our hotel. Hotel? Where's the hotel? Korea is full of them! The entire state is full of public saunas. Let's go! Yu Jin. Thank you. You're welcome. You had the exclusive rights for the show, but you still allowed the performance. -Shall we go eat? -Shall we? Congratulations! Are you back? Should I be thanking you? Are you going to be ok? What about Bae Kang Hee? We will take care of that slowly. Right? Hello Chairman. Is it ok to talk at this late hour? Of course, everything is going well. Really? Jin did? Ok. I will take care of it. Thank you! Is there a problem with Jin? It's probably because of the girl he met at the drama company. Girl? You know the girl that even came to Aunt's funeral. He denies it... But I think he ended up breaking up with Ra Kyung because of her. You're grateful, right? How did you know that I was here? My lips woke me up. They wanted to see Go Eun Bi. Eww... Go Eun Bi was threatened by her role-model, Bae Kang Hee that she won't ever get a stage. I have spent all of my money to pay for the penalty for the song. It's really a grim situation. It is... It's really grim. But we're smiling. Should we not smile then? No. I wasn't afraid. Afraid of Bae Kang Hee? I think things have become clear now. What did? What I want, and what I'm good at. -The person Go Eun Bi loves... -People. -People? -People. Person... People. Person... People. -Person. -People. Let me tell you something before you go. I really hate running. Eun Bi! It's hot! Eun Bi! Hold on! Yu Jin. -What's wrong? -You have been transferred sir. What? Transfer Notice Open this. You're good. I study online. I also come here to learn once in a while. You weren't learning. You were teaching. When I came here, I saw that no one knew what Mr. Yu had taught me. I just shared the knowledge. Oh yeah, I heard you got first place. Good job! You get first place like you always have in the old days. What did Dad say? He is soft about it now. Once he heard that you're the lead actress, and you have won the first place, He asked if you're putting up the show pretty soon. Really? And? And what? Your father doesn't talk much. He said, "Ok. Good night." When is the performance then? Pretty soon. I really want to see it. I want to see your act. Let's drink. This is the list of small theaters until the end of the year. What are the highlights? They are theaters that have their shows cancelled. We should call them first. This looks good. Let's take this! I don't think the theater will be a problem. But we won't have enough money. Hey! You know Hong Jae Yi complains at $35 lunch box. You remember how much the lunch box he had was last time? $1.90? And few ramen. They don't add up to $35 still. And you want to mention money in front of him? Don't worry about it. Jae Yi. Hong Jae Yi. You will know soon enough what it means to be poor. There are a lot of things that you want to do, but you don't have money for them. You will see how you change. But... Don't worry. We also have the word "sponsors" in our vocabulary. What does that mean? "Sponsor" is to "help." Reinforcement. To help. "Support" is to "help." -You know it in English? -"Help." -Call them first. -Ok. Yu Jin. Did you hear the news? We have called you to our secretary office. Yes sir. Why all of the sudden? What's the point of doing a small fund like that for a long time? Chief Executive Officer : Yu Jae Joon! Chief Executive Officer : Yu Jae Joon! Once you're over thirty, you may think that you have your life figured out. But, Jin... Wisdom of life, comes when you're old enough to kick the bucket. You also find out that you're too old to do anything with that wisdom. Even if you regret that, "Had I known what I know now," it will be too late. That's what I'm trying to tell you right now. To you it may seem unfair and inhumane. Jin! Trust your grandfather, who knows the world and you. I just want what's best for you. Even if you're right, Grandpa, right now, I can't follow the wisdom that you're talking about. The world is changing fast. People are living different lives. You just don't want to acknowledge that. I may come back later in regret. When that happens, I will be back with the wisdom that I have learned from the world. Yes, President. Yeah, I'm back. We have a performance coming up. Contract? We don't need contracts between us. Yes, yes. I will get you set up today. I know your account number. You know my number too right? Of course. Ok! Take care. We have a whole road in front of us. Ok? Ok! Yeah! Hey! What are you doing? These are the documents for your transition. These are the projects that Yu Jin has started... No... No... We don't need any of this. Put these away. Bring me the docutments for Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails. That's not related to us. I will make it related. Your boss will make it related. It's up to me. Do you understand? Go find out what's going on with Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails. What are you looking at? Go! Resignation What's this? Good bye. Hey! Hey! What's wrong with him? Hello? It's me. Do you know what those Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails people are doing these days? What? They are looking for a theater? Which one? What are you talking about? All 6 theaters are reserved? In just one day? Yeah, I don't know what's going on either. It's as if they have been set up to have a schedule all of the sudden. It even feels like someone is trying to stop us from putting up the show. It's obvious. I thought Bae Kang Hee was backing out too easily. We knew this was coming. What's the point of calling her now? Point? Point is to ask her why she did this. Do you have a proof? Who else would do this except for her? What if it's not her? Even if Kang Hee says that she's done it, we will just have to beg her to help her. What? You have really grown up. Back in the days, you would have been like, "What am I going to do? It's because of me. I will quit." Sob sob. Sob sob? Not, "sob sob." Did you just hit me? Eun Bi! You're still my student. Gone, gone, gone. It's here. That's cool. Isn't it? Did something happen? What? If you had won such a big contest, you should be pretty busy and excited by now. Yes, I am busy and excited. You seem confused and lost. Does it show? It's the most grim face that I saw in you. What's going on? Perhaps I could be of help. Tell me. Give me a chance to do something for you. The theaters that were supposed to put up our shows, cancelled on us all of the sudden. Just in one day. All 6 of them. As if it was all set up. What? If we can't get a theater, the contract term will soon end with the staff. DIMP sponsorship will be gone too. If that happens, reward ceremony and New York performances will be cancelled too. Someone must be doing this on purpose. No way. Right? But it's really happening. It's really driving me nuts. Hold on. Theaters? Mom! It's me. Didn't you say that Uncle built a theater last month and donated it to a foundation? Where is it? No, I will call Uncle myself. What are you doing here? Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails team has enough funds to start with the sponsorship. They still lack funds for production costs and marketing costs. Also Yu Jae Joon has stopped all the theaters. Theaters? I don't know how they did it, but they have gotten a theater somehow. They have paid initial pay for all the staff and actors when they were preparing with an idol. They can just pay the rest after the show. But they still have to be successful to pay them off. So what I'm saying is that, they need a financial expert. A CFO. Me? You like getting "follows"? You seem pretty into it. People react fast. It's also accurate. It has more truth than articles that journalists have made up. Also people are influenced quite a lot by this. Yeah. As soon as you say that a musical was pretty good, those small pieces get a huge hit. You heard that Yu Jae Joon is now at Yu Jin's office? Yeah. He's very different from Yu Jin. Are you worried? What am I worried about? Everyone knows that Bae Kang Hee is the most important insurance for success in Korea. Then you've got nothing to worry about. As long as you're my husband, no matter who the fund representative is, you won't have difficulties in getting fund. Tens of thousands of people move at a word. I make a million-dollar move by signing contracts for shows. Do they know what it means to have such a wife? I didn't expect that you will be coming together. I don't like to meet others' expectations. We need your approval anyways. It's better that you're here. I heard that you had something to say about our project. I want to participate. I heard that the fund released all the rights to us. I want to personally participate as Yu Jin, regardless of my position in the fund. Yes, I finished up. Of course. Don't worry. Yes. Good Night. I have made the index small so that it's easy to read. I have put in three simulations per heading. For week days and weekends, 90% of paid audiences. 70% 50%. The price will be $35, $40, and $50. The costs of production is here. I'm sorry. I have difficulties with numbers. I'm not good at reading either. If you just let me do the financial part, it will be much easier. I think you need about $30,000 for production cost right now. How did you know that? We have no reason to have a fund manager with high salary for a small project like this. Let's go! I will take care of the $30,000. I will be CFO of the entire production afterwards. You don't have to worry about the costs. You just need to do your job. What will you get from this? If you give me 3% of the profit for the next 10 years, and priorities for selling the piece afterwards, I will also take 5% profit of that. 3% and 5% are not much. Making that big is my job. You're one of those people who think it's not worth it unless it's hundreds of millions dollars. Hong Jae Yi. You believe that you have changed? What do you mean? If you can change, you can't rule out the fact that other people can change too. I have gotten sponsors from wine companies for $20,000 for just putting their wines during the show. They are waiting for your co-signature now. That's impossible. It's impossible. They say people who untie this will have their life solved out at once. Where do you learn all these? I search Internet every night so that I can see you smile. Really? Yeah! I can't even sleep at night! It's pretty. I hope that every second in your life is sweet. Thank you for taking care of the theater problem. I want to thank you, too. For the watch. Count Monti Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails. You have prepared 500 shows. But we have only received about 400 shows. Also the background color, We asked for P30079. Yes. Count Monti. Count Monti. You look great. Yes. You're helping the production? Yes, I have only given a proposal. But I didn't get an answer yet. Also I didn't know that you were in the team back then. Does it matter? I was afraid that it may bother you. Don't worry about me. Just do whatever you like. You know if we come across often... It will be harder for you. Me? I thought that I will die if I let go of you, when I was hanging on the cliff. But then I found out that I had wings. Does that make sense? I was also thankful that you let me know that I had wings. That's good then. Eun Bi, Jae Yi, and I... And Joon Hyuk who just wants my happiness knowing that he has no chance with me. Can you handle all these people? As long it as it doesn't bother you. That's good then. What? That you can say that it doesn't matter wholeheartedly for something like this. I will go first. See you later. Audience? Of course, it's full. President! Oh! Fantastic! President Yu! Our Madonna, Your Highness! You're so beautiful that you got the flowers killed. No way. Thank you. I feel that everything is falling back to its place now. I love big men. Size matters to me. Size should come first! Let me see! I know that look. It's deep and warm look of his. Don't get me wrong. Wake up! Those looks were dead a long time ago. They were dead and were forgotten, by the beloved ones. Father has always told me when I was young. Life is wonderful! I believed that lie. To us only this heart! On the day that it meant the world to me. The memories are now back! I still miss that beautiful day! Our love should never change... I will always... I will say everything truthfully today. I will say it with my one last breath. That it's my only love. You should stop now. -Always turn on humidifier when you go to bed. -Ok. Eat right when you wake up. Although, you will probably be pretty nervous to eat. I eat better when I'm nervous. But you can't eat too much! Wait! Looks like you have to sleep here tonight. There are just too many things that I have to take care of. I can't trust Sa Bok Ja. What? You're like a wolf. A wolf? You're a fox! Nine Tails! It's the show tomorrow. It's hard to believe isn't it? Yeah. Finally tomorrow, Eun Bi will become Do Hwa on the stage. What's this? What? Umm... For the sake of conditions of the actress, you advised me that I spend the night here and do this. You think that's the right behavior as a teacher? Oh, this and that? If it happens, then you should sort of fall for it. And we can move onto the next base. I'm going then. Spend the night here. If you just wait a little, I may really become Nine Tails and take your heart. You like it? It's called acute vocal chord damage. They don't know how long it will last. Yes... Ji Mi may have to step up until the end. Let's just prepare for the worst. Also starting today... Yeah... Thanks. We will have to see for 6 months if it will improve or not. I think it's best if you don't use your voice at all. Are you ok? I think I thought for a long time how we will end our relationship. I have had many ways in my mind. But I had never thought about this. When I took off the engagement ring, you grabbed my hand and told me: "Live as an actress." You said that you will love the actress, Bae Kang Hee, in your way. I can't be an actress anymore. Perhaps, disappearing like this, suits me the best. Thanks to you, I was very safe. Thank you. Yeah. Let's end the love of a musical producer, Han Sang Won, who loved the actress, Bae Kang Hee. But... Let's start the story of Han Sang Won loving Bae Kang Hee as a man now. Kang Hee! Don't do this. I didn't love Bae Kang Hee, the actress. I just loved you, Bae Kang Hee. Please... Don't say anything. It's alright if you can't sing. It's ok if you can't recite your lines. It's ok if you can't stand on the stage. But I... I want to hear something from you. So don't lose your voice. You can't lose your voice. Have a great day, Bae Kang Hee. Calm the Chinese down at all costs! Tell them there's not going to be a problem. Buy us some time. You can't lose drinking when you're doing business with the Chinese. Yes! Drink wisely. Jin? Jin is doing well. Don't worry. Ok! I'm hanging up. Chairman. Did you get the call from President Yu Jin Young? I just got his call. I don't think President Yu Jin Young is telling you, because he's afraid that you will be worried. If we can't get $100 million by next month, all of the investment we have made will be gone. I will go to China and help my father. It won't be as helpful as capital from Chairman Suh, but I found an alternate investment from America. It's really nice. Did someone you know build this place too? No, it's probably under my name. So I guess it's ours. We're almost home. Sober up a bit. I will never drink again with you. This way... this way. Don't ever drink again. Hey! I will get going first. I have to get people's luggage. People's luggage? You mean Ra Kyung's! Look at him lying. You should go to Sang Mi too. Geez... What about you? I will be staying here. You can go. What? You're going to stay here by yourself? -Let's go. -What are you doing? Give them some room. What? Bye, Eun Bi! Bye! I love you, Eun Bi. I love you... I think. I really love you. Just a year ago... Someone once told me, that I shouldn't even dream about doing musicals. He called himself Hong Jae Yi or whatever. You're the sob at Han River? You're... What are you going to do if I'm really Hong Jae Yi? You can be Hong Jae Yi. A drunkass broke Hong Jae Yi. I'll be Bae Kang Hee! I'm going to put my piece for Han Sang Won's musical contest. You should write the songs for my piece. Under one condition. If it's an actress you bring, it's even better. She's new. The actress you have in mind... You get close with the songwriter so that you can get an act when you're not even good enough. I think I know that much. Am I wrong? I will do it. I will just show her, what it means to be doing a double casting with me. I'm going to be double casted with Bae Kang Hee? If you say that you got over me, that's a lie. I'm back because I moved on. Jae Yi. Were you here with Hong Jae Yi last night? Yes, what? I love Hong Jae Yi. It's ok. Cheer up. Postpone Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails to next year. Let's do Count Monti first. It's over. Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails is over! You won't regret it? I won't. What did you say? I will make sure that they put up Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails. We said that we will do this together. Let's go until the end. Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails. $4 million. Since I'm spending $4 million, can I put up a condition? Get someone that I can accept other than her, or I won't do it. I will start from the bottom as your stand-by sub. -Why did you tell us to cut Go Eun Bi then? -Hey! You could have just said that you didn't want to do musicals. You should have slept a bit. I couldnt thank you or apologize to you. She's asleep now. Ok. Good night. Teacher!
