Mills, did you check this when you signed out the paperwork? - Uh, roger, Sergeant. They said everything was good to go. - And you inspected the truck? - Yeah, sort of. - What do you mean sort of? - Well, sir, I looked at it from the outside. - Dammit Mills, you didn't look under the hood? - If I did, I really wouldn't be able to identify the radiator hose. - Sergeant, how much longer on the truck repairs? - Repair, sir? - Yeah, we can't stay on this road for very long. - Well, I'm not a fuckin' mechanic and even if I was, we don't have the proper parts to fix this thing. Mills, call in our grid. Hey, what the fuck are you doing? - Just-- - Hey, your pictures aren't helping out right now. - Well, Avery, go ahead and take your photos. - Hey, this isn't the time to play celebrity, sir. - Now, I have direct orders from the top saying that Avery over here has full disclosure of our mission. These are top orders, Sergeant. Don't make this more than it is. - Right, sir. Alright, well Paparazzi, if he's gonna let us, we need to get out of our current situation right now. Mills, call in our grid. - This is F.O. Team to outpost. Do you copy? F.O. Team to outpost. Do you copy? - Are you getting anything through the transmitter? - Negative, sir. Only hear a low hum. - We must be far enough behind enemy lines if they've already jammed our radios. - Mills, you're probably dehydrated. Drink some water. - Sergeant, we've had 32 other missions and I've never had a problem as a radio operator. - Alright, Mills. Now, we need to get off this road and now. If any of the enemy locals come by, they're gonna alert the real enemy of our presence. - Well, if you wanna play soldier, you can help us take this truck off the road. - Roger, Sergeant. - Alright, let's move this thing, squad. - Yes, sir. - On the count of three. One, two, three. Let's try one more time. One, two, three. To hell with this, let's do this. - Just wanna leave it, sir? Fuck it. - We're gonna leave it on the side of the road. Let's get off the road and take cover. Silva, you take lead. Squad, file up. Squad, halt. Gather under this tree. There's nothing like an early morning in enemy territory. Now, let's go ahead and figure out what the hell we're gonna do here. Alright. Now, this is the outpost from which we left this morning. We traveled about six miles or so to the enemy line and then about another six miles or so. I'd say we broke down about right there. Now, we're supposed to get a little bit further. Make it down to where we can call in an air strike for where the enemy has stationed their field trucks. We were going to make it to this point, here, and call in that air strike and everything goes boom. Looks like my first mission's gonna have to be a failed one. - What about this point, sir? - It's about six miles from where we are. - Well, can we make it there? I'll carry Private Paparazzi if I have to. - We don't have the water or rations for that. We were only prepped for 36 hours with vehicular and radio support. - Hey, Mills, try the radio again. - F.O. Team to outpost. Do you copy? Still the low hum. - Patch me through. This is F.O. Leader to outpost. Do you copy? Yup, there's that low hum. It's a signal I heard in training exercises. We're definitely having our radios jammed. - We don't have very many options here, sir. - No, we don't. Now, taking that road without any cover is a death wish. Well, hold on. Now, this river here, this goes exactly where we need to go. If we just followed that, it would take us right back to the green. - So, that's your plan, sir? Go down river? - Yeah. - Sir, that's right in the enemy's concentrated area. - Well, we wait until nightfall. We build a raft and we slip right past 'em. They won't even know we're there. - Listen, sir. I know you haven't done this very many times, but the enemy isn't just not gonna notice. - Well, this is going through the enemy perimeter. There's minimal chance of contact, plus these roads are used for logistical support. Or we could go with your plan, Sergeant. - Alright, Mills. Just you and toward the base camp and get us there, alright? - Roger, Sergeant. - Hey, Private Paparazzi. Since you don't have a weapon, stay close to us, alright? - Look, with your shotgun you can end someone's life. You know with my camera, I can make 'em live forever. - Your instructors told you that? - Yeah. I got the better weapon. - Well, I doubt they've ever been stuck behind enemy lines. Come on, let's go. - Hey, this is a good spot. Let's stay here. Let's take a break, drink some water. - I agree, I agree. - Drink some water privates. Anybody need a snack? - You guys are good? How your feet? - They hurt, but I'm good. - Keep your eyes peeled everyone. Hey, Paparazzi. - Yeah, just tell me when you want your picture. - How are your feet, sir? - What's that? - How are your feet? - My feet are great. - Yeah. - I don't know about yours. How are yours? - They're alright. - Good to hear. I wouldn't be too worried about me. I was a endurance runner back in college. - Okay, sir. - I did track once. - Yeah? - Once or twice, yeah. - Couldn't stick with it? Ah, you like that artsy stuff too much, hum? - Are you guys ready to go? - Yep. - Just get us outta here. - Roger, Sergeant. Thank you, Sergeant. No problem, sir. - You can bet I appreciate it. - You should probably bring your own camel back. - Thank you, Sergeant. Note taken. Squad halt. Now, Sergeant, I'm thinking that we go straight through this valley. What do you think? - Ah, it's not a very good idea, sir. - Well, it's the quickest way. It's one direct route. - Yeah, but I bet you there's snipers all over this place, like up there and up there. That's where I'd be. - Well, take out those binoculars. Take a look around. See what you see. See anything? - Yeah, right there, sir. Looks like one of our uniformed guys. Seems like he's down. Like I said, snipers all over these hills. - Mills, we got an anomaly up there behind that bush. Why don't you go check it out? - No, fuck that, Mills. Stay right there. - That is an order, Mills. Go and check it out. - Roger, sir. - What the...? - Mills! Get back here! Oh my God! - See, I fucking told you, sir. That thing is fucking booby trapped. - Okay, but where the hell else are we supposed to go? We don't have food. We don't have rations for anything else. - Why don't we just stick to the fucking treeline? - Why don't we take a diagonal through the valley? I mean, shit, that could have been just a leftover mine from ages ago. - A diagonal? Sir. I know you're fucking new to this, but no, that's not gonna work. - No, listen, listen. I've been through training. I know what I'm supposed to do. The only way we're gonna get there is go through this valley. - Well, sir, this valley was taken from us about two months ago while you were still playing beer pong. - What is that supposed to mean? - Look, we can't take-- - Now, listen to me, Sergeant. I'm the one giving orders here, alright? - Alright sir, well, check it out. That's gonna fucking get us killed. That's gonna get us fucking home. So which do you wanna do? You wanna die or do you wanna go home? - I wanna go home. - Cool. - You can guarantee me of that? - Hell yes, sir, if we stick to this fucking treeline. - I'll give it to you this time, Sergeant, but don't you ever talk to me back again like that, alright? - Roger, sir. - Alright. You're taking point. Mills, are you alright? - Roger, sir. - Avery? You're taking point. - Alright guys. Let's get out of here. - Mills, what the fuck? We're not supposed to be this close. Fuck. Mills, we're not supposed to be this close to the action. What are you doing? - This the way the compass says to go. - Gimme that thing. Follow me. Let's go. Sir, I can hear the river. - Come on, down on the ground. Whoa, stay calm Sergeant. - This is calm. - This is a native of the land. He's not necessarily the enemy. - Well, he can tell where the enemy's at. Guess we'll just detain him. - Alright, alright. Now. He's unarmed. We're detaining him. What should we do next? Guess we could take him back up to the treeline, figure out what to do from there. - Alright. Alright, that's a good idea. - Should just kill him right here. - Come on, you son of a bitch. Come on, come on. There we go. Well done, Sergeant. Let's take him to a more secure location. - Alright. - Come on, you bastard. - Policy, sir, killing the detainee is probably the best course of action. - That is a war crime that I'm not comfortable with. - Who cares? It's one filthy native. He's probably thinking about killing us right now. - How the hell do you know that he's thinking about killing us? And besides, Private Avery has full disclosure of our mission. - What, are you a snitch now? - What? - Hey, leave him alone. Shut the hell up. Nothing happens to this detainee until the L.T. says. - The plan is that we wait until nightfall, we build a raft and then we get the hell outta here. Now, what we'll do is until nightfall, we'll take turns guarding this guy and then we'll get out. Sounds good to me. - Alright. - Shit, I'll take the first watch. - You sure you can handle that? He'll be fine. - Alright. Well, Silv's up. Avery and I will go get logs and get that raft started so we can get the hell outta here. You're on point, Silva. Let's go. Watch him close, Mills. - Okay Avery, keep it up. - Sir, what do you think we should do with that native? I mean, what do honestly think we should do? - Honestly? I really, really hope that we can just cut him loose and let him go when we get outta here. - As long as we're on our way out, I can do that. - Keep at it, Sergeant. It'll come down eventually. - I think we would have won the war by the time this branch comes down. Fuck you, Avery. - Yo, why won't you fuckin' look at me? Are you fuckin' scared? What the fuck is your problem? I bet you know where the enemy is right now, don't you? They're probably just sittin' here waitin' to kill my brothers. I'm not dealin' with this bullshit. - You know, if the continents hadn't split, would we still wage war the way we do? - I think if that were the case, we'd already be extinct. - Yeah, probably. - You know, sometimes you gotta put fear into your enemy in order to gain respect to your nation. - Yeah, or you could just adopt Communism, then the government controls its people and their actions. - You don't believe that, sir, do you? - Well, just 'cause I don't believe it, it doesn't mean that other people don't feel the same way. - You know, when this war's over, I'm gonna have a group of kids. I'm gonna line 'em up. I'm gonna tell 'em stories about this war. If they don't shit themselves, I'm gonna beat the shit out them. - Now, what the hell, Sergeant? Damn, you're more fucked up than the Communists. - War is hell. - Little filthy-ass native. I know you wanna kill all my fuckin' brothers. Probably wanna go home to your fuckin' wife, your ugly-ass wife, probably wanna fuck some goats or some shit, whatever the fuck you natives do. What do you even do, like, what the fuck? Are you even worth anything? Why am I here guarding you? I should just fuckin' kill you right now. You know what? I got something for you. Go ahead. Get outta here. I'm fucking done with you. Get your ass outta here. Do you not fucking hear me? Get your punk ass outta here. - Hey, Avery. - Hey. - Seen you taking a lot of pictures, but I don't see you write anything down, like in a journal or anything. Is that what you're trained to do? - Yeah, you know, that's what we're trained to do back there, but my officer in charge down there just thinks they're worthless. So, he just treats 'em like shit. - So, how do you write your papers or whatever? - Well, other people, they like to, they add a bunch of lies and just add shit, but that's why I take so many pictures out here is that when I get back, I sit down, look through all of them and write from the pictures and the feelings that, you know, I remember when I was taking them. Write from experience and find a theme. - So, what theme did you find for this mission? - Welp. Since I took this opportunity to go behind enemy lines, and you know, we're kinda stranded out here, I'm feelin' the will to survive. - That's funny. Us stuck out here with the will to survive. Yeah, that's rich. - Yep. But you know, mostly why I came in to, you know, combat journalism is, back home, people don't really care we're dying. Boys are dying out here every day. People back home don't, frankly, they don't just give a shit. - Yeah. - I wanna change that. - Yeah. - With these stories I'll change that. - Yeah the people back home, they know what's going on here, they just choose not to care. - Yeah. - You got any chow left? - Nope. Nothin' left. - I got something for ya. Here ya go. Eat that like a real soldier. - Thanks, Sarge. Jap cheese. - Go fuckin' dumbass. Get your ass up. Go. Come on. Get your ass up. I won't even fuckin' look. Look, I'm not even looking. Get your ass up and run. - Shit. - Mills. - Mills. - Mills, Mills, Mills, Mills, Mills. Okay, alright? - Don't let me die, Sarge. - Here, you'll be fine, you'll be fine. Fuck. You'll be fine. It's his femoral artery. Pretty sure he's not gonna make it. - We're gonna stay the night here. We'll figure out what to do in the morning. - Hey man. Remember that time we told Davis to bring that soda out on a mission? - Yeah. - And he forgot the damn soda. Yeah, we must have called him Soda for about eight missions then. And what about that time before Lieutenant Key left us? We got all the way out to his spot and he told you to call something in. What was you gettin' in? - All those damn cows. Then I radioed back. - Avery, where's the Sergeant? - He's still down there. - Hey, Paparazzi, wake up. - What's up? - You hungry? - Yeah. - Follow me. These guys have gotta be the perimeter detail. - Yeah. - Well, there's only one way we're gonna eat. - Oh, you know, I don't know, man. - Hey, you can wait another night without food or we can eat right now. - Yeah, you're right. Let's do this. - Looks like we get to eat. Oh, next time you hit him in the liver. He'll go into shock. It'll be easier for ya. - Yeah. - Alright, wake up soldiers. Come on. Come on, rise and shine troops. Now, why was nobody standing guard? Come on, Sergeant. Private, we're behind enemy lines, not on vacation. Let's get some more logs so we can go ahead and finish this raft and get the hell outta here by tonight, alright? - Yes, sir. - Damn. - Hey, Mills would have want you to have this. Can I trust you? You got my back, right? - Yeah, I won't let you down. - Alright, let's get out there and do this. - Alright. - This is looking good, gentlemen. - Thank you, sir. - This should work. I think this is gonna actually get us there. You should definitely put another line down the center. - Alright, I need to find some more logs. Avery? - Yeah? - You go that way. You got Mills' weapon, so you should be able to handle yourself, alright? - Roger. - I'll hold down the raft, maybe I'll tie a line down the middle. - Hey, Lieutenant. - What are you doing, Avery? - Just give it a few minutes. The water from the river will help remove the sands. It'll be good to drink after that. - That's not a good idea. I mean, we don't know where this river's origin is. We don't know what the local illnesses are. - Ooh, that's good to drink. - Where the hell did you learn to do that? - My grandpa. When I was little, we used to go camping a lot. - Close with your family then, huh? - Yeah, you could say so. A little bit, I mean, my parents divorced when I was young, so I constantly grew up in a different household. It was just easier going into the military, live on my own. - Sometimes it's best to go off and do your own thing. - What about you, Lieutenant? - I used to be, 'til I got divorced. See, we were in college. We had a son. My family still loves her, but she cheated on me. - Sorry to hear that. That's rough. - It's alright. My family is still trying to tell me to make it work, but I knew that if she did it once, she would do it again, right? - Yeah. - But, it's okay. I'm gonna focus on my military career. I'm gonna retire as a colonel. I'm gonna buy a nice house, a nice boat. - Oh, yeah. - Maybe someday my son will even love me again. - Well, you know, Lieutenant, your son's gonna grow up. He's gonna mature. He'll learn to understand that that was the best thing for you to do. It was for the best. - What about you? You got a girlfriend back home, Avery? - Yeah, I got a girlfriend, but, she's not quite back home right now. - Where is she, then? - I met her back at an operating base and she's a cook there. - Oh, man. You journalists really do know how to have a fun time during wartime. - Hell, yeah. - Well, don't even worry about it. I'm not gonna tell anybody under command that you're bumping uglies with the mess hall chick. - Thank you. - No problem, well, Let's get that raft built so we can get you back to that mess hall, huh? - Alright, let's go. - Hey, you guys gotta come check this out. - What's up? Avery and I have been doing all the work around here, so this better be worth it. - Okay, well, sir, this is time for you to earn your reward for being behind enemy lines. Come on. Follow me. There. - Good find, Sergeant. We're definitely gonna need to sneak by those guys under cover of night. - Sir, check it out. - That's an enemy general. - You think so? - I'm positive. I remember in the mission briefing seeing that guy wearing that hat in one of the photos. Definitely means we're gonna have to pass by these guys under cover of night, regardless. Alright, let's go. Take lead, Silva. - This is probably good. - Yeah, right here. Set her down. - So, yeah, just go ahead and alert the enemy while we're waiting to get our way home. - Yeah, then we'd actually have something to do. - What is that supposed to mean? - We've just been sittin' here this whole time, this whole fucking deployment. I've just been sitting here, off in the distance calling in air strikes. I'm sick of it. - What do you expect us to do? - We got a general over there right now. We could take him out and actually impact this war. - In the middle of enemy territory? Now, why do you think that's a good idea? - Well sir, we have this perfect opportunity right now. He's just sittin' there, waitin' for us. - You know what? It wouldn't matter if we took out their general. If it were one of our generals, he would be replaced in a week, and the fighting would continue. Am I wrong? The best thing we can do is survive, so that we can go back, train for another mission and then come back here and impact the war. - Sir, why'd you even join in the first place? - Oh, I don't see why we need to bring our personal life decisions into this conversation. - Well, I joined to make a purpose in my life, to make a difference in this world, and right now, we have that perfect opportunity. - Listen, we're stickin' to the plan that I came up with. We're gonna build this raft. We're gonna escape by night and we're going to get home. I don't wanna hear you say anything else about it. Where you goin'? Where you goin'? - This is fuckin' bullshit. Who the fuck does he think he is? I been through 32 fuckin' missions, and he thinks he can just walk in here and tell me what the fuck to do? - Hey look, Silva-- - Shut the fuck up. - Now, hold on. That general, well, he came in on a boat. You didn't mention that. He came on a boat. We been tryin' to build this rickety ass raft. We're not gonna float down any river. We get that boat. We kill that general. You get your fame and we're able to get out of here. - That boat was big enough for all us, huh? - Had oars, too. - Fuckin' genius, kid. Fuckin' genius. Sir, sir. We've got a plan. - Oh, no. Didn't seem like the last one was too smart, Silva. - Yeah well, just hear me out. This is how we're gonna get home. You may not like it, but, it's gonna get us home. - Alright, let's hear it. - Alright, so the general came in on a boat big enough for all of us and all of our gear. So, we just go over there and take his boat from him. Yeah, it'll be perfect. Hear me out. I shimmy across. I lay down the distraction, draw him out. You guys, you and Avery-- - Hit him from the back. - Boom, in the tent, take whoever's left. Whatever guys I don't pick off, you take care of. Easy peasy. - You know, I don't think that anybody is ever ready to fight in a war. Think we do it instinctively in order to survive. Let's do this, Sergeant. - It's gonna work, sir. - The only thing we have to fear is bullets. - You know, I think Mills would say, "Let's kill these mother fuckers." - Let's do it. - Alright, guys. I'm gonna go set up. When I start firing, that's your cue. - Alright. - Good luck, Sergeant. - Good luck. Let's do this, Avery. - Hey, shitheads! - We should get outta here. - Silva. - Those fuckers didn't have a chance. - Private, Sergeant, we gotta go, guys. With all that racket, enemy's bound to be approaching again. Let's get the hell outta here, boys. - What's wrong? - I think we're on the wrong river. - Wrong river? - We went further south into enemy territory. - Shit, Silva's dead. - Fuck. What the hell did you do that for? - We all know that shit's worthless, anyway. Sir, where are we going? - I don't know.
