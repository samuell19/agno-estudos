After nearly eight years of torturous court proceedings, and twice being convicted of brutally murdering her flat mate, Amanda Knox is finally free. I'm incredibly grateful... For the justice I've received, for the support that I've had from everyone. From my family, from my friend, to strangers, to people like you... I, it... You've saved my life, and I'm so grateful, and I... I'm so grateful to have my life back. Multiple convictions and appeals, only for Amanda Knox and her then boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito... To be found innocent of sexually assaulting and murdering the 21-year-old English exchange student Meredith Kercher. Meredith was my friend. And... It's... She deserved so much in this life. I... I'm the lucky one. Now those at the heart of this tragedy speak. Four years prison. Six months of solitary confinement. And still today, I feel that bitterness. We filmed Rudy Guede, the only person held responsible for the crime, now out of prison after serving 14 years. He still insists he's innocent. The fact that he is walking free, and still no answers for the family... Is nothing short of an absolute outrage. Ever since Meredith's murder, her family have clung to the hope that one day they would get justice. What happened to my daughter Meredith is... Every parent's nightmare. Of something so terrible happening. When basically, she was in the safest place. Her bedroom. The most controversial murder trial of the modern age, eight years of torment for those caught up in it. And still the question is being asked. Who murdered Meredith Kercher? Meredith Kercher walks home from a quiet evening with friends along the ancient streets of Perugia. The hilltop city is normally bustling with student. But on this national holiday, it's deserted. It's a dark place. It's an intense and somewhat claustrophobic city. Meredith regularly calls her parents, and worries about drug dealers. At 8:56PM, she tries to call home. But no one answers. At 9PM, Meredith is seen on CCTV, arriving back at her empty student house that she shares with Amanda Knox. Meredith's phone registers its last call at 10, to her British bank. But whoever calls fails to put in the UK dialling code. And the call doesn't go through. The next morning, Meredith's body is found in her bedroom, covered by a blanket with two brutal wounds to her neck, five smaller cuts, and more than a dozen bruises. Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini takes charge of the investigation, and is soon convinced there were multiple attackers... Led by Amanda Knox. I left New York thinking she was guilty, and that I was going to write about an American girl who had turned into a psychopath the night after Halloween. And slashed her roommate to death. I believed that's what I was going to find. Mignini weaves Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito into a complex conspiracy theory. A sex game that went horribly wrong. With a man they didn't know. Rudy Guede. It felt like Mignini was making a big jump from going from, "Here's the murder scene and what we know," and then making little leaps of faith in between that. So that there had been this new orgy, that they had approached Meredith and she had rebuffed them, and that's why... She became the victim of this abhorrent murder. And... It was a theory he was very fond of. But it was just that, a theory. And the evidence doesn't stack up. The knife that's said to be the murder weapon doesn't fit most of the wounds. It's too big. It is impossible to have made any of the stabbing wounds on Meredith. It could have possibly created a slashing wound, but so could a piece of glass. Prosecutor Mignini needs two vital bits of forensic evidence to put Amanda and Raffaele at the crime scene. But that DNA evidence is unreliable. They were looking at extraordinary things that no one else was doing. We thought it was... It was unreliable. And it was likely... A... A contaminant, a transfer, because they had a lot of samples from the victim in the lab, that they were processing. And we know you can get things... All mixed up in a lab. Any doubts are ignored at the first trial. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito are convicted and face more than 25 years in prison. As they begin their appeal, their case becomes a press obsession. Petty domestic arguments between Amanda and Meredith are interpreted as a motive for murder. The media... Loves... Attractive female killers. And if you throw some sex in there, even better. They love the catfight aspect of it, women fighting each other. She called herself Foxy Knoxy, which was the... The girl soccer team joke about her. And had nothing to do with sex, and now it was, "Foxy Knoxy... She's, you know... A sex... A vixen." After I was accused of murder, people read new meaning into everything about me. A hickey on my neck became a scratch from Meredith in her last desperate moments. An awkward encounter about a dirty toilet became a murder motive. Male friends I brought home became mysterious lovers of questionable character. It's the dawn of social media. Soon the controversy escalates into an online war. It was the first example of what we have come to expect in the fake news Internet, misinformation era. You had a lot of the things that we see now as commonplace. The swarming. The DIY... "I know better than the cops. I know how to solve this." I've never seen journalists have to... To, to dig so deep on a case. And also I'm noticing journalists... Take sides themselves. In the titanic struggle, countries are pitted against each other. This is a miscarriage of justice. I think the President should absolutely get involved. And I think people should boycott Italy. Lawyer Luca Maori says the escalating obsession with Amanda Knox and his client Raffaele Sollecito ensnares the prosecutors. But it could have all been avoided. The evidence of exactly what happened is there at the start. That crime scene was rich in evidence. And that was like a jungle. You know, it had so much stuff in it. You had the DNA of the killer, you have the fingerprints or the palm prints of the killer in the victim's blood. You have his shoe print. You have the entire storey. It all points to a far simpler scenario. Neither Raffaele nor Amanda's DNA, none of it, is found anywhere at the crime scene. Not next in any of the rest of the clothes, or the, the bra that was clearly ripped from this poor woman. And... You know, Rudy Guede is everywhere. Investigators pride themselves on having those gut feelings. But if you find that you've made a mistake, which they did when they saw that Rudy Guede's fingerprints were in that room. Admit "oh no" quickly, because look what happens. Just barrel ahead against all evidence, and keep... Weaving this weird web of... Of unlikeliness. Two years after the murder, the prosecutor's case is about to be taken apart. And part of the impetus is going to come from the most unlikely source. Thousands of miles from Italy. Two years after the murder. The three defendants convicted of the crime face decades in prison, and are preparing appeals. Amanda Knox is put on suicide watch. A mental guard would look in on me every five minutes. I wasn't suicidal, but my insides had already die. But in America, there's a growing sense of confidence regarding her case. It comes from people she's never met. My name's Steve Moore. I was an FBI agent for 25 years. I worked just about every violation that the FBI has. My wife Michelle watched some kind of documentary on the Knox case, and she was very upset. She said, "I wonder if Amanda Knox really did this." And my response was not favourable. I think my exact words were, "Since when did you start listening to the press and not the prosecutor?" I told her I could prove Amanda Knox was guilty in three pieces of evidence. Because there was a knife, there was a confession, and there was DNA. One thing you do in law enforcement, is you work on probabilities and statistics. Women generally don't kill other women, and when they do, it's rarely with a knife. The controversy also attracts the attention of leading forensic biologist Greg Hampikian. Who spent 20 years using forensic science to overturn wrongful convictions in the United States. I was in England, my son was getting married. To a British girl. And the British papers were saying terrible things about, about the case, and about Amanda Knox. So I was like, "well, you know, I'll just reach out to them." There were two pieces of evidence that concerned me. One was the knife that the prosecution contended was the lethal weapon. The knife itself had some problems, it was not the right size for three of the incisions in the neck. The only forensic evidence that puts Amanda Knox at the murder scene is that knife. But it was found a quarter of a mile away in Raffaele's flat. And it has just one microscopic trace of DNA attributed to Meredith. The entire forensic case against Amanda Knox rested on this unreliable single result. They tried to repeat it, they couldn't repeat it. The other key prosecution piece of evidence is Meredith's bra clasp. The only piece of DNA evidence that puts Raffaele at the murder scene. But Greg thinks this was also contaminated. They're handling this, this bra clasp piece from one to another touching it on the very part that they're going to swab. With dirty gloves. That's the problem with this case. Weak evidence, single piece for each... Not... Providence not well documented. And low amounts of DNA. But the Italian courts are about to make a dramatic decision. And the end of December, Rudy Guede's separate appeal confirms his conviction. But it drastically reduces his sentence. From 30 years to just 16. The prosecution has no objection to this guy's sentence being cut in half, and we know that he's the guy with the blood on his hands! That's incongruous. One of the reasons for the reduction is Rudy Guede's difficult childhood. At the age of five, he left his mother behind in the Ivory Coast. Growing up in Italy, he was often left to fend for himself. Professor Claudio Mariani has worked with Rudy ever since the appeal. Trying to help with his rehabilitation. Rudy's defence commissions a psychological report. Which finds Rudy has an acute stress disorder. But it's left to a journalist to discover the full storey. We talked to the daughter of the richest man in Perugia, who had temporarily adopted him when he was a teenager. They met him on the basketball court, and they were charmed by him. And they brought him home, and said, you know, "Daddy, can we... You know, can he live with us?" They got him tutored, and they took him on holidays to London. And skiing holidays. And... As quickly as he was brought into this magical world, he was ejected because they'd found that he'd been lying. About what he was doing, and the father suddenly rejected him. Rudy's passion is basketball. But he struggles to find work, and spends most of his time hanging out with students. Digging deeper, Nina found a very troubled side to Rudy Guede's character. We went through his Facebook friends, and we started looking at the people that he associated with. And this one guy, Viktor Linkov said, "Yeah, I hung out with him all summer. He was a pretty cool dude... But he had these weird tics. One of which was he didn't like to sleep in his own house. Because he told us that sometimes he would wake up and not know where he was." He had a sleepwalking issue. And he would wake up in the middle of the night, and be a different person. Like, bark like a dog or pretend to be a professor. And they couldn't, like, sort of shake him out of these, like, states. And these are fugue states. And fugue states are associated with childhood abuse. This was not hard discovery. Like, I wasn't, you know, this guy was available to talk to people. Nobody went and interviewed the friends. None of that is considered by the court. Rudy Guede's conviction is later upheld but the Italian Supreme Court. With only a brief examination of the evidence, the court accepts Rudy's account of what happened. Then the court makes the all-important ruling. That he acted in a conspiracy with others. Sexually assaulting Meredith, but never actually holding the knife. So Rudy essentially implicates Amanda, and he says there were three people at the time. That court then takes that as gospel. Takes that as truth. And when they accept that, they put it in the court record as being fact. But they establish it without evidence, so now you can't acquit these two because then you're looking for two others. Across the Atlantic, Amanda is winning in the court of public opinion. As doubts about the Italian forensics grow by the day. The President should get involved. This is, this is a miscarriage of justice. I think the President should absolutely get involved. And I think people should Boycott Italy. They shouldn't go to Italy. Rudy Guede's lawyer was one of Perugia's leading defence council, Valter Biscotti. Three years after Meredith's murder. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito's appeal finally starts in the same Perugia courtroom. Once again, Meredith's family faces months of uncertainty. [Narrator[ A new judge starts by saying, "The only certainty is that Meredith was murdered." I felt a breath of fresh air. In Italy, unlike the US and the UK, there's an automatic right to appeal. And what's more, it's like a full second trial. The judges determine to reassess all the evidence. And he orders an independent review of the DNA evidence. Once we got it, everything has been changed. Completely. They show off all the flaws about this investigation. What certainty the Kercher family are clinging to could soon be ripped from them. Nearly four years on, and Meredith's murder is about to become even more mysterious. Despite all the forensic evidence at the crime scene, the independent review finds there's a fundamental problem with the two key pieces of DNA evidence. A senior scientist, appointed by the court, is shocked when she finally gets to see the murder weapon. The knife that's meant to revel Meredith's DNA. So she can't retest the knife, and has to be content to review the original analysis. The microscopic trace of DNA that the police claim is Meredith's is so small, the test can't be repeated. These are serious scientists. Well, I thought it was brilliant! Canti and Vecchiotti went through very carefully to talk about the amount of DNA, and it was only one spot that gave any DNA. And this is a really small amount of DNA. They were far below the amount of DNA that these kits have been validated for by the companies that made them. And they're not... Working within internationally recognised standards. Meredith Kercher was repeatedly stabbed. So if this is the murder weapon, a great deal of blood would have been found. But the blade is clean, apart from one microscopic trace of DNA. And that's not even from blood. With such a microscopic sample, it is highly likely the trace is just contamination. DNA transfers very easily, right? You and I, if we shake hands, I've got some of your DNA on my hand. If I have washed my hand before I came in here and you didn't, my hand might have more DNA of yours if I swab it than of mine. And so... DNA is very bad at telling us how it got there. It's very good at giving us an identity. The other key piece of evidence is the bra clasp. It's meant to prove Raffaele was at the murder scene. But there is a serious problem with that, too. The police video shows forensics finding Meredith's bra clasp on day two of the search. They even photograph the clasp. But then, they leave it behind. 45 days later, forensics finally collect this vital piece of evidence from under a rug, a yard away from where it was first spotted. It's a storm. It's... It's a comedy. They're holding it, and they're holding the very metal part in their gloves that supposedly Raffaele's DNA was taken from. And not only are they holding it in gloves, which you can see have marks on them, they're not clean gloves. They're visually dirty gloves. Then the first CSI guy holds it up, and then he hands it! Somebody else was like, "Let me see, let me see, let me see!" And they, like, touch it as well! And so they're breaking all these rules. And then, you know, they take it, and somebody puts it on the floor. To take a picture, I think. I've never seen anything like that. The conclusion of the independent review, that these two key pieces of DNA evidence are worthless, is a devastating blow to Mignini and his fellow prosecutor, Manuela Comodi. Who was in charge of the forensics. Crime scenes are messy places. Things happen at scenes. That doesn't mean we throw evidence out because people didn't follow every single rule. But if that's your one piece of physical evidence against a suspect? Which it was, in this case. That, that really is a lousy piece of evidence. In that same search, six weeks after the murder, police finally collect another crucial clue. Meredith's bloodstained handbag is still there, but her credit cards, house keys, and 300 euros are missing. Yet the handbag would have been key in discovering whether the break in was staged by conspirators or whether Rudy Guede acted alone. If you're a forensic team, and you're at a crime scene immediately after a crime, and the victim's purse us there with visible blood on it... That is something you want. That is priority one. That is first thing I'm taking. Because money's in purses. Other things are in purses. And if there's a bloody handprint on it, you can bet the murderer's fingerprints are possibly on it. After months of legal argument, the Kercher family steels themselves for the Court of Appeal's verdict. Steve Moore flies from the US to support Amanda. I thought it was almost macabre. It was late, late at night and a crowd had formed outside. And I stood in that courtroom, 'cause there were no seats, for two hours. Those were the longest two hours of my life. The only thing I did was pray. I saw Amanda weeping and I started to get terrified, and I was with a reporter. And she said, "No, no!" And... And then I... I cried. I actually screamed out. I just remember being elated, "My God, it's over." You know, "She's gonna come home." It is strange to say that was, but I was sad. I felt sad because... I already spent four years in prison. So once I get out, I felt my life is completely changed. People will look at me in a very different way. You got a sense that Perugia itself, the town, was not pleased. I think that many people there thought that they were guilty. Getting Amanda out of the country was a little clandestine. The job was to pull the press away from Amanda's car. I was several miles away at a location in the middle of nowhere, and I remember it was about one in the morning and I was there with Amanda's mother. The Mercedes drives up, and we got in the car, and this driver... Well trained driver, I can tell you. Stomped on the gas, and we were outta there. There was, there was just much silent weeping in the back for a while. I remember one of the first things she said was, "Do you know how long it's been since I've been in a car?" And her mom said, "Four years." She goes, "Yeah, that's about right." They're reminding me to speak in English. 'Cause I'm having problems with that. I'm really overwhelmed right now. That was... Deeply emotional, and I just felt like there was gonna be no way for her to process everything she was feeling, or communicate that to the people. What's important for me to say is just thank you to everyone who's believed in me... Who's defended me, who's supported my family. I just want... My family's the most important thing to me right now, and I just want to go and be with them. So thank you... For being there for me. For the Kercher family, the Perugia court's ruling is devastating. Their lawyer is Francesco Maresca. It was obviously a bit of a shock. You know, it is difficult. We still have no answers. For us it feels very much almost like back to square one, and the search goes on, really, to find out what really happened. With Mignini's theories, and the key forensic evidence discredited, hope for the Kercher family is fading. But in Italy, prosecutors can launch a further appeal after acquittal. And the search for Meredith's murderer is about to take a dramatic new turn. In Amanda Knox's hometown, the mood is upbeat. She and Raffaele Sollecito have been acquitted after the crucial forensic evidence was found to be unreliable. But the highest court in Italy is now about to deliver its verdict in yet another appeal. I remember when Amanda came home. And I remember we had a great Thanksgiving there. You know, I keep asking about the legal stuff. Like, "What's gonna happen at the Supreme Court?" "Oh, it's just pro forma, they won't reverse it." You know, nobody thinks they're gonna reverse it. Of course, my gut is like, "Oh my God." I've seen reversals that everybody told me would never happen. And I was... I was a little nervous. The prosecution won't give up. Although their case has been blown out of the water, they now have another theory. At the start of the investigation, Giuliano Mignini and his fellow prosecutor Manuela Comodi, claim the killers cleaned up the murder scene with bleach. Shortly after the murder, police tested the corridor with a special chemical and say they detected the hidden footprints of Amanda and Raffaele. Where did she get her training? The chemicals do detect blood. It also detects bleach. If Amanda saw her bloody footprints, and cleaned them up, it wouldn't be this perfect imprint of a foot! It would have been smudged all over the place because she would have cleaned it up. And if Amanda didn't clean it up, you wouldn't be looking at hidden blood, you would be seeing actual blood. Drops of blood in the bathroom are more evidence of cleaning. According to the prosecution. They claim Amanda took a shower to wash off blood. But the telltale signs of bleaching aren't there in the corridor or Meredith's bedroom. It didn't look like a clean room to me. It's just a spurious argument. I think it comes from, "How is it possible that someone commits a crime and leaves no DNA?" There is absolutely no way to go in, and... And know where all your DNA is, remove that carefully, and leave all the other stuff. And leave no trace of bleaching? Leave no, no residue of the bleach, nothing. Every time we would answer, like, some storey that they put forward, some proposition, they'd come up with a new proposition. The case involved sexual assault. Yet sperm found on a cushion placed under Meredith's body was never tested. The prosecution says the stains were old, and couldn't tie anyone to being at the scene. Nobody test the sperm on the cushion. And they said it's not important. Well, are you serious? Are you serious? The endless legal battle provides constant ammunition for the competing tabloids. Now the bitter war of words is increasingly spilling out across the Internet. There was an army of bloggers reading and checking every word you wrote. These are bloggers who, who were fairly passionate and... And divided into these two opposing armies. It was a kind of war going on online. It was a new world. I mean, I, I just... I had never seen anything more... I was the villain for trying to do justice. I had a... An absolute... Following of haters. Who tried to make my life miserable in any way they could. There were people trying to find me, there were people threatening Amanda's life, threatening my life. Six years after Meredith's murder, with the battle raging between the two sides, the Supreme Court in Rome delivers an astonishing verdict. It quashes Amanda and Raffaele's acquittal, and orders a full retrial. I just thought the fix was in. Nobody who was unbiased or... or of average intelligence could look at the real evidence in the case and convict her. Despite the painstaking independent DNA review... Italy's highest court calls for the forensics and all the circumstantial evidence to be looked at again. And it emphasises the ruling in the records of Rudy Guede's trial. That he acted with others. Everything is to be reviewed. Apart from questions about Rudy Guede. Whose early life and criminal past had largely been ignored by the investigation and the courts. Could he have simply been a lone burglar? Nobody was paying attention. To the third guy whose fingerprints were in blood all over the room. But who had, moreover, had fled immediately after the murder to another country. There's apparent evidence of a break in. A broken window... and a rock found inside the first floor bedroom Meredith's cash and credit cars were missing from her handbag. But the prosecution won't accept it's a burglary. They say it's all staged. The window is 12 feet off the ground, and close to the road. I've been to the cottage. He was hidden until he actually went through the window. He was completely hidden, and had the best hiding place. It was in the corner of the building, that was the most concealed area for him to throw the rock through. And Rudy is an athletic, semi-professional basketball player. There's a rock in the room! It looks like a burglary, it smells like a burglary. If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck. You don't start saying things like it was staged until the burglary makes no sense. The burglary still made sense. You've got a burglary and a girl dead. Those things happen. The journalist Nina Burleigh goes to Milan to check out more about Rudy Guede's past. Just five days before Meredith's murder, Rudy Guede was found asleep inside a nursery school. The proprietor of that nursery said that he was cool as a cucumber. And... You know, she called the police, and in his bag, they found a knife. Also in his bag is a computer stolen from a lawyer's office in Perugia two weeks before. He is not Italian. He has broken into, of all things, a preschool where children go. He is passed out, he's got a knife. They arrest him, and then they just release him. And put him on a train back to Perugia. Rudy was only ever convicted once, of handling stolen goods and attempted theft. But in the two months before Meredith's murder, there were five break ins that seemed to bear the hallmarks of Rudy Guede. Rudy Guede denies this, and Prosecutor Mignini says the break ins have nothing to do with Meredith's murder. It appears that after the summer that this was his main way of getting funding. One of the things that Rudy does when he burglarises, and this is kind of... It, it's... It's individual, but it's not unusual. Some burglars do this. They make themselves at home. He would look for food, he would turn the heat up, he would lie down on the couch for a little while... He would have a soda. And then he would sort of... Very casually wander around and take stuff. At the Perugia law office that was burgled two and a half weeks before Meredith's murder, there's another surprise. A first floor window at the back of the office is smashed by a rock. It's argued this is exactly how Rudy Guede broke into Meredith's house. So Rudy would throw a rock through a window. And if somebody was home, they're going to come to that window to see what happened. So Rudy goes to the bushes a few feet away, and if somebody comes to the window, he chooses a different house. That's how he did it. A week before the murder, Rudy's next door neighbour is burgled while she's out. Two months before the murder, Rudy was identified breaking into another house. A gentleman named Christian Tramontano woke up to find him in his house one day. And he pulled a knife on him. So he had, like... He was carrying a knife. As far as we know, he had never used the knife. All that's about to be ignored yet again. But Rudy Guede's testimony, putting others at the murder scene, will still be accepted, unchallenged. Seven years on from the murder, the latest appeal in Florence reconvicts Amanda and Raffaele. And actually increases her sentence by two and a half years. I, I... I think I turned white as a ghost. Call the families, say, "What do, what do we do next?" And worry, like, is she gonna be extradited? Poor Raffaele, my first thought went to him, because he was there in Italy. We felt very... Very hopeless. I was completely... Lost. This time, the judges actually misinterpret the tainted forensic evidence. With yet more disastrous consequences. It was a gut punch. It was a gut punch. If you put bad data in, you're gonna get bad data out. If you use bad evidence, you're gonna get a bad verdict. Simple as that. For the Kercher family, however, it feels like a glimmer of hope in their search for closure in the case. Their verdict has been upheld. Again this time. So we hope that obviously, coming end of the trial, we are nearer to the truth and, and an end, so that we can just start to remember Meredith for just who she was, and... And draw the line under it. But there's another appeal yet to come. Soon, Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito will learn their fate. Now the prosecutors prepare their case for the last time. Nearly eight years, four conflicting verdicts. In Rome, the scene is set for the final judgement of the highest court of Italy. This time, there will be no further appeal. Everybody was on tenterhooks. And the poor family have had this hanging over their heads for eight years. It was staggering to me. How we could have spent so many years to get to that point. I was very nervous, and I wanted to face and see the court with my eyes. I was followed by 11 police people. They were afraid that I would run. I didn't want to flee, anyway. I was just... Demoralised. I am really scared. I just think, "Anything could happen." And this is the last shot. I was on the phone with Amanda earlier that morning. I and Amanda were both pessimistic. And you know, a lot of discussion was about what do we do if they demand extradition or something like that. The Supreme Court declares Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito are entirely innocent of the charges of conspiring to sexually assault and murder Meredith Kercher. I was crying, she was crying, and I got pulled over for driving while I was talking on the phone. Meredith was my friend. And... It's... She deserved so much in this life. I... I'm the lucky one. So, thank you. Thank you. I've got to go. We really can't do that now. Thank you so much. I remember calling, and everybody was just really happy. I remember I just kept asking, "Is there anything else?" "What else can happen? Is there anything else that can happen?" And they assured me no, this is... This is it. I did felt joy. Yeah, I did. It was bittersweet. Four years. Four years prison. Six months of solitary confinement. And still today, I feel that bitterness. Even though I've moved on with my life. For the Kercher family, the verdict is a bewildering rejection of everything they've been led to believe. The first reaction was one of surprise. And then I was shocked. Because... I've had two convictions. And they've had two acquittals now. It seems an awful long time to get such a strange verdict. Eight years, and you're saying you don't actually know who did it? So it's sort of bringing everything into... Disrepute. They have been led up and down a hill several times. I can't imagine what they went through in terms of building themselves up to hear a verdict, to then having it change, to then having it changed again. To then having it changed again, to say that they were innocent. And I think by that stage, they were just numb. You had a group of judges at Supreme Court who, who went through the evidence and said, "This is, this is absurd. We want this to stop, we don't believe they did it." Enough. The Supreme Court rules definitively that there is no DNA evidence placing Amanda or Raffaele at the murder scene in Meredith's bedroom. It dismisses Mignini's contention that they could have cleaned away the evidence or staged the burglary. So why did Prosecutor Mignini ever bring the prosecution against Amanda and Raffaele? The cops' and Mignini's assessment of their behaviour, is the foundational step to them being charged. They had just found the body, bloody body of her roommate. Oh my God, she doesn't have any sense of tragedy here. Grief here. She's making out with her boyfriend. You know, proper Italian girls would not behave that way. And in Mignini's mind, that made him think she could be a killer. I didn't know how to deal with stuff. The only thing I could do, the only one that was caring about Amanda in that moment. Now for the first time, Raffaele admits he was naive when the police investigated him and Amanda. I do regret that I was immature, but we were young. We were just kind of foolish, and things we didn't get. What, what's going on? Your girlfriend's roommate is murdered. Everybody could react in a different way. Mignini was such a character, if you wrote about him in a book, people would think it was overblown. He was... He was such a force of nature. He was so fill of enthusiasm for the prosecution, and... But very much came across to me as somebody who gets his way through force of personality. And in a case like this, that's not sufficient. You have to have the DNA evidence, the forensic evidence to back it up. At the time of the murder, Prosecutor Mignini was accused of abuse of office, though later acquitted. Determined to restore his reputation, Mignini's instinct was to devise a complex conspiracy theory. Amanda and Raffaele's so-called confessions never backed up his theory of conspiracy, either. Despite hours of police questioning without a lawyer present, neither of them ever confess to carrying out the crime. I know a lot about interview and interrogation. I am a trained FBI agent. If you gave me 53 hours in that room with Amanda using their techniques... I could have gotten her to say anything. I could have gotten Mignini to confess to the crime. And she still never confessed to the crime! And she's 20 years old, and she's not they're tag teaming, you know, yelling at her at three in the morning. Italy's highest court has ruled that Amanda and Raffaele didn't murder Meredith. But it fails to answer who did. The only person convicted of the murder is Rudy Guede, he spent 14 years in prison, and was freed last year. We found Guede in Viterbo, at a criminology institute. Rudy continues to insist his innocence. He says he tried to save Meredith's life. Getting towels to stem the bleeding, but leaving without ringing for an ambulance. Professor Mariani gave him voluntary work at the institute to help with his rehabilitation. Rudy Guede was never cross examined by defence lawyers in the Italian courts. The earlier court rulings state he wasn't alone in the house, and he didn't stab Meredith. This remains the legal truth on which he relies. The sad fact is there was no shortage of evidence left in the house. But after all the faults with the forensics and the prosecution case, will it ever be possible to say what really happened that November night? Despite eight different and lengthy hearings, the Italian courts never came up with a definitive account of what really happened. But the clues were there. The house was deserted that night. And the only other person who freely admits to being there is Rudy Guede. Who had a history of breaking in. He sees the upper floor, it's dark. He has every expectation that this is an empty place. He throws the rock. He starts to bust through her clothes. And he's doing what he's used to doing, which is going into these empty places, making himself at home. He takes a dump, and while he's on the toilet, the victim comes home. Meredith Kercher opens the door with the key. Of course she turns the key, and locks the door. She goes to her room. He can't get out without her keys. And you can just imagine how this plays out. He puts a knife to the neck, and he nicks her. Or she struggles, and he's cut her. He's now crossed the line. And she's screaming, and she's wounded, and... He becomes a murderer. Rudy Guede denies this scenario. And it was never proved he was the lone attacker. But the court did rule there wasn't a conspiracy with Amanda and Raffaele. What happened was it became a morality tale about female sexuality. Meredith was pitched as this puritanical virgin-ous Madonna character. And I was portrayed as this sexually, like, obsessed, like, lustful, uninhibited whore. And ultimately the reason why people liked, so latched onto this case, was because they were having, like... They were having, they were judging female sexuality through us. They didn't care about the truth anymore. And that is an insane problem. The prosecutor and the online mob that went for this conspiracy theory, they were the ones behind the diversion of attention from the victim to this fascinating murderess. When in fact, the murderer was... like 99% of women murdered, killed by a man and that's too boring and too mundane for a lot of the journalists. And it was too boring for the mob. The online mob. The couldn't accept that it was just another burglary gone wrong. It had to be more... Salacious, it had to be more fascinating. It had to be a storey. Prosecutor Mignini always claims it was only the media who were obsessed with Amanda. He says he never encouraged them. Today, Perugia has moved on. The reporters are long gone. Rudy Guede wrote to the Kercher family to express his sympathy. [Narrator[ Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini is now retired. But he also insists he was right. Amanda's prison chaplain is his lifelong friend. And Father Saulo Scarabattoli has now helped foster a remarkable dialogue between Mignini and Knox. Mignini feels he's been unfairly scapegoated. When many other prosecutors and judges were involved. But he is now agreed to Amanda's request to meet. Amanda Knox now lives back in Seattle. Hosting podcast series, including one about true crime. And bringing up her newborn baby girl. I've always put myself in Meredith's shoes. And I, like, I'm sort of haunted by this survivor skill kind of thing. It's the, it's the first year that I've put myself in Meredith's mom's shoes. And I... Am thinking about that for my own daughter. How I... I want the world to be a better place for her than it was for me. Raffaele now works in cloud computing. But saus he still suffers discrimination, and remains haunted by what wet on that November night. It's very hard when somebody you care about is lost forever. But the truth that I don't have anything to do with this murder. So... I hope one day they will accept it. Meredith's father wrote, movingly, about the family living through a seemingly never ending limbo and having to face the stark possibility that they may never have a satisfactory picture of what unfolded in Perugia... On that terrible November nigh. It was very moving, because far beyond their unimaginable loss... To get up and handle it the way they did, with, with such grace and such dignity. Both Meredith's parents have now passed away. But Meredith is not forgotten. She would put herself last, and always think of her friends first. And her love of language, and, you know, literature and life, and travel... She wanted to meet people. She wanted to become friends with people. She had a lovely personality. She's still happy now, and that's... In a way, a triumph over... Over death.
