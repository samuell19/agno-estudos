[music playing] [motorcycles rumbling] [tires squeaking] Got a light? [gunshot] [shouting] [tires screech] You dirty bastards. [gunshot] Ugh. [gunshot] Jeanne. Dinner, Jeanne. JEANNE: Be right there. What's that noise? It's just a movie for Christ's sake. [motorcycles rumbling] Zim, it's a nice neighborhood. Go make the neighbors happy. Ripp, take that building and find me something pretty. [thud] Smells good. What's for dinner? [scream] - Shh. You'll wake the neighbors. Take him. What the hell? [clatter] I'm gonna get you, punk. Ugh. [scream] Kinda romantic, isn't it? [fabric rips] [gunshot] [scream] Whoops. Check upstairs. NEWSCASTER (ON TV): Downtown Sector Y between Hill and Walter has been declared an emergency zone by Police Chief Conrad Felker. All citizens of that sector are now under police control. This is ME TV I'm Brad Brandt. Welcome to another bright and cheery day. [knocking] There's some government idiot outside who insists on seeing you. Do you want me to give him the runaround? What do you want? Oh. What doesn't a man want? Excuse me. This area is being evacuated completely. But this factory is still operating. It is police procedure to remove all people who are in danger of being attacked. Now, if you would just sign right here. I am not signing anything. I'm not going anywhere. My father built this factory, and I'm going to stay. And the police-- the police will take care of it now. Look. I'm not leaving. [motorcycle revving] [gun cocks] [engine sputters] [gunshot] [explosion] We're done here. Let's get back to the hole. [shouting] OPAL BRAND: This is Opal Brand from Police Headquarters. Chief Felker, do you foresee any problems with removing these families from their homes? I do not anticipate any problems with the evacuation. OPAL BRAND: Don't you think people will want to stay? After last night, I doubt it. I think that would be suicide. [whistling] ANNOUNCER (ON PA): The evacuation buses will be waiting at the main gate in one hour. Please finish packing and turn off all the machinery. Thank you for all the work you've done here. We hope to open again soon. Hey, Brett. Where the hell they gonna put all these people? I don't know. Probably some huge shanty town east of the Meadows. Maybe they'll use that old army base. This could turn into a big vacation, huh? Don't you watch the news? 29 people died last night. And don't tell me that's life in the big city. Jack. Nancy I don't want to leave, Jack. I'm not leaving. What about you? What I'm going to do is buy you two a beer and make you forget all about your problems. Why don't you two go ahead? I have to pick up my brother. We're going to have a hell of party here. Yeah. Mad dogs and dead rats. We going to tonight? We wait for the word. For how long? As long as it takes. Who's with you, Nancy? It's just me, Malcolm. They're friends. Jack, Brett, this is my brother Malcolm. Malcolm. I think Jack wants to shake your hand. You'll have to forgive me, Jack. I'm quite blind. Well, it's nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Obviously, not everything. [siren blaring distance] JACK MURPHY: Look at this. BRETT: What the hell is that? JACK MURPHY: It's one of those temporary evacuation camps. BRETT: Looks pretty miserable. Let's check it out. ANNOUNCER (ON PA): All citizens with blue relocation cards will be given blankets at 1300 hours. Maria Durand, your daughter is at the main office. Please come claim her. Soup will be served at 1400 hours. Have a nice day. Let's get out of here. [engine starts] Let's see some ID. Where you guys going? - Home. Huh. Nobody goes home. Turn this thing around and report to your relocation officer. Yes, sir. Have a nice day. [tires squealing] [gunshots] Shit. Son of a bitch. Step on it. What are you doing? [gunshots] Ha ha. [tires screech] Are you fucking crazy? That was a cop. BRETT: Chill out. OK. - Oh yeah. No problem. We can go back and apologize. Hey, this isn't your daddy's little town any more, Jack. It's a fucking war zone. That cop was ready to kill us. Check this out. Valmet 223 automatic, 30 rounds in the clip. Well, we used to sharp shoot when we were kids, but this-- it's one of them, isn't it? Yeah. [tires screeching] - Let's take him. - Not here. Get back in the truck. [gun cocks] [gunshot] [engine starts] [tires squealing] [gun cocks] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshots] [tires screech] [gun cocks] Hold it. Nice day for a drive. Nice day to die. Not just yet. We'll be back. We'll be ready. I hope so. How soon do you think they'll be back? I don't know. Maybe hours, maybe days. Maybe they won't come back. [scoffs] I think they know we're here. Well, then we can't stay here. Why not? We know the building, inside and out. We know the whole area. Where else we going to go? I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in some police relocation camp for the rest of my life. And I sure as hell am not going to give this factory up to some terrorist gang just because the police can't contain them. Now, as far as I know, nobody has stood up to them-- And lived. Wait a minute, Jack. He's right. If we're going to die, let's do it fighting our way out of here. I can't make any of you stay. All I can do is ask you to stay here and defend something we believe in. This place is ours. Out there we're just numbers on a list. Look. If any of you want to leave, I won't hold that against you. [hammering] This may sound like a strange question, but is there anything I can do? [hammering] Bingo. Jackpot. We should attack now. We wait for orders. We sit here being played like puppets. Others are out there getting fat off of our work. It's time we had a piece of our own pie. No! [thud] I've decided. We'll attack now. And a plan? Stay here then. Zim will lead the attack. When orders come, you can join us. [gun cocks] I could use some fresh air myself. [rattling] Now. Don't shoot. [gun cocks] Don't shoot. Look. I didn't know you people were here. This is a bad neighborhood. The cops locked me out of my building. Yeah. So what are you doing here? Like I told your friend here. I got locked out. The police, they shipped everyone out on buses. I had no place to go. So I started to walk around, and I heard this hammering. And I figured I'd check it out. Look. All I'm doing is looking for a place to hide. All right. You can stay with us if you like. Stay? This place is crawling with gangs. Pardon me for saying, but you guys don't stand a snowball's chance in hell. So if you'll excuse me, I'm leaving. No. Let the idiot get shot. Thanks for the invite. Well, goodbye. [motorcycle rumbling] What was that? [shouting] [automatic gunfire] - You know how to use them? - I live downtown. Remember? Nancy, take that window. Brett, that one. I'll cover the door from here. Malcolm, keep the doors loaded. What about me? Stay down. Out of the way. Oh my god. It's show time. [gun cocks] Want to play, huh. [gunshot] [shout] [gunshot] [gunfire] Fire! Get down. [automatic gunfire] What do we do now? Shoot back. [gunfire] Kill them! [gunfire] [glass shatters] Woo. [screaming] I want him dead. [gunfire] Nancy! Nancy! Hey, guys. Hey, guys! Guys! [gunshot] [screaming] [thump] [gunshot] Keep shooting. [gunfire] Oh shit. Ugh. Woo! Yeah! - Everybody, OK? - Yeah. We're all right. I need more ammo. [gunshot] [gunfire] Kill them! This is crazy! Paul, stay down! [gunshot] I'm coming back for you, you son of a bitch! [motorcycle revs] Oh my god. I'm dying. I'm dying. - Nah. Nah. The bullet passed through. There's blood. There's blood all over. I feel faint. I feel faint. I'm dying. - Hey. Hey. Hey. Thanks for covering us there. It was a real brave. Yeah? We got problems in sector Z. What kind of problems? Some nut's barricaded himself inside a factory. Where? The Murphy plant. Old Marvin Murphy. Is his kid running that plant now? Yep. He didn't sign his relocation papers, nor did he show up at his assigned place in the Evac City. Kid must be as crazy as his old man. That could be dangerous. Dangerous. Our copter got a vid of the whole area. 15 stiffs lying about outside. All Ratts. Should we bring him in? No. The Ratts will probably attack again. We can't get involved. It's too risky. He had his chance to leave. NEWSCASTER (ON TV): That was the latest from Russia. And now back to our main story, a gang of armed vigilantes have engaged in several gun battles with the Ratts gang. For more on this story, we go live now to Opal Brand. OPAL BRAND (ON TV): This Opal Brand. I'm standing outside the Murphy plant, which appears to have been the scene of several bloody encounters. I'll attempt to go inside the plant. We got company. [gun cocks] ME TV. I think we're about to become stars. Great. Here's a member of the vigilante group, standing in the doorway to their HQ. Is there any particular reason why you've decided to take the law into your own hands? Well, it's dangerous outside-- So you've armed yourself and taken the initiative to hunt down young street children? What young children? Does this mean you're taking a news team hostage? No. Look. They are shooting at us. I don't see anybody shooting. Well, you should have been here two hours ago, sweetheart. Have that one edited out. Are you the leader here? If not, who is? And what's your name? - Murphy. Jack. No. I am not the leader. This is not a vigilante group. Look. I don't know what the hell you want, lady, but this is private property and-- Edit that one too. Get me a shot of that. You want the bandage, [inaudible]?? Sure. And definitely get me a shot of this arsenal. Don't you folks think you should lay down your weapons and report to your relocation camp. This whole sector is under martial law. There is no more private property. I mean you're not really planning on staying here, are you? We're staying. Set Rolling. This is Opal Brand for ME TV news standing amongst the few survivors in the last stand effort of the doomed vigilante group. We will keep you informed if any new stories develop. You want a story? Stick around, Miss Opal Brand. Already noted. Want any pick-ups? No. We got the story. - What? That's it? That's what you call a story? You just pack up and leave? End story. Wait. [sigh] Son of a bitch. Oh my god. [engine sputters] Mm. Mm. Mm. Should haven't left your car parked in such a bad neighborhood. Ah. Probably just those kids you were talking about. This is going to ruin my entire day. Well, I guess they didn't know you were leaving. At least you can stick around for the rest of your story. That's impossible. I've got deadlines. I have to cover a suicide attempt in Eastland in an hour. Hey, can you fix this car? Well, I don't know. I could try. Great. Then, I'll stick around until you're done. Oh boy. That'll give us a chance to get to know each other. Why don't you start working? I haven't got all day. BRETT: This car is history. There's a hole in the radiator. The distributor's gone. And there's sugar in the gas line. Go make a phone call. Oh, right. But the line's dead. The lines have been off for days. Lines are dead. I'm glad we settled that. Look. Since we are going to spend a cozy night together, I suggest we all get some sleep. So let's go into the hallway. Brett, cover the windows. Scott, cover the doors. Hold it. We're not staying. Well, you won't get very far on foot. The Ratts will eat you up. All right. We'll stay for one night then. But you're not making us a part of your silly revolution. You want guard dogs. Use your own. SCOTT: I don't mind-- - Shut up. You work for me. - If you want to stay here. You better help. - Look. I didn't ask to be here, so don't plan on making us a part of your routine. She's right. We don't even have to be here. We don't have to listen to you. - Fine. Then, sleep on the street tonight. PAUL: Personally, I think that's a wonderful idea. BRETT: Oh yeah. PAUL: Nobody asked you. NANCY: Fine. [gunshot] That's much better. Scott, cover the door. The rest of you go to sleep. I guess this round is yours. You should lay off that stuff. I have an image to uphold. You're not going to be much good to anyone if you can't see straight. Ahh. [gasping] I didn't know my leadership was in question. [gasping] It isn't. Good. How much longer are we going to stay in these tunnels? Why? Don't you like it here? The living dead. The scum that crawls under a decaying city. And besides, what better place to hide? [laugh] And that factory is going down. This attack is wearing the men out. There's plenty of other places to go. That's not the plan. The Ratts won't hold. Well, they'll have to. We're almost done. There's no turning back now. [gun cocks] - Miss Brand. Shh. Give me some change. - But-- - Listen. I got to make a phone call. [distant dogs barking] [screaming] OPERATOR (ON PHONE): $0.30 please. Please deposit $0.30. Thank you. You're welcome. Hurry the fuck up. SECRETARY (ON PHONE): Metro Events. Please hold. Yes. Can I help you? - Yeah. This is Opal Brand. Get me Chuck Davis immediately. This is an emergency. SECRETARY (ON PHONE): I'll check to see if he's in. Please hold. He's not in. Can I take a message? [gasp] - [grunt] - Just in time. I was doing fine by myself. What are you doing out here? Just trying to get us some help. The only thing you're going to do is get us killed. Let's go. [gunshot] Ugh. Not so brave without a gun, are you, pal? Say good night. [gunshot] I hope they're all right. Shut up and sit down. [gun cocks] Have a nice walk? Just played a little ball with the neighbors. Are you OK? We heard shots. I thought maybe-- - Stop thinking. Don't you have something else to do? I'm going to bed. Miss Brand, thanks. I didn't want to owe you one. That's all. Good night. That woman can make ice cubes with her personality. [sigh] She's scared. She just had to shoot a man. I don't blame her for being a little numb. What's going on wouldn't be easy for anybody. Sometimes, I-- Get some sleep. [sigh] I can't sleep. She's an interesting lady. Tell that to Nancy. And what's that supposed to mean? Forget it. I mean we've talked about it before, and you always give the same response. So I just-- [sigh] - Piss off. [sigh] [mumbling] Take one. [whirring] Is there something wrong? No. [sniffle] I have work to do. Why don't you tell me what's wrong? What you did out there was self-defense. I wasn't defending myself. I'm not sorry I did it. It's just that I make it a habit of not getting involved. It makes for bad reporting. Unfortunately, I seem to be up to my neck in it this time. It's a nice neck. Like I said-- You try not to get involved. I find your delusions amusing. ZIM: So do I. [gun cocks] [gunfire] Shit. [gunfire] [shout] Kill him! [gunshot] [laugh] He's dead, Jack. He's dead. You OK? I'm fine. Go warn the others. I'm going after him. Hey, Greg. See anything? We just ran into three of them. One got away. Hey. Sleeping on the job will get you fired. Shit. Nice of him to let us in. [gun cocks] What do you want with us? We want you, Mr. Jack Murphy. Oh yes. We know who you are. You've become quite a hero. Not to us, mind you, but others do so need their heroes. Now, don't they? I'd hate to die not knowing who you are. We're Ratts, Mr. Murphy. Just Ratts. And that's all you need to know. Someday, somebody's going to come along and blow you away. It appears that for once the sailors have left the ship to the rats. Take him alive. [gunshots] What's going on? They're in the bay area. We need guns and ammo. They're out there. Well, that's great. Why don't we just shoot ourselves and save them the trouble? Hey, you volunteering to be first? We got to get to the guns, Jack. Right. Scott, come with me. No. I'll go. All right. Brett, Nancy, wait here. When you hear shooting, try to get to the weapons. OK. I'm going to get up above them. Air shaft. Air shaft. All right. Let's do it. What's this? Central air. My father had it put in. Now, this either goes into the service bay or right to the boiler. I wish I could remember which. This is a great idea, Jack. You know, it's been a long time since I played in here. We used to play here when we were kids. You know I remember the time-- Hurry up. You know, this goes-- one of these goes into the sewer, I think. Can they hear us talking? Nah. I hope this doesn't go to the boiler. [inaudible] What? I hate waiting. They're coming. [gunfire] Stop, you idiot. You're going to get us killed. Brett, stop. He's right. I'm sorry. Where the hell is Jack? Shit. Where the hell are we? We're lost. - Great. - Look. Just give me a minute, will you? I don't need you bitching about everything. Where are you going? Somebody has to make a decision. All right. I'm sorry. No. You're not. Well, if I wasn't before, I am now. I'm going in. Who's with me? Jack said we should wait. BRETT: Fuck that. No. Scott, open it. Keep me covered. - Hey, you'll get us all killed. - Open the door. - Brett. BRETT: Open it! - Brett. Open it now! Now! [yell] [gunfire] Shit. Let's go. The guns! Fuck the guns. We got to get out of here. [scream] How do you propose we do that? I say we negotiate with them. Look. What do they want? Us or the building? No pile of bricks is worth dying for. You don't understand. Yeah. I understand. You want to be heroes. You want to die on the 11 o'clock news. Well, I don't. I came here to live. That's right. I say we give them It seems simple to me. Nothing's as simple as that. I'll get the guns. What I can't see can't hurt me. Right? Stop him. [gunshots] Jack! [gunfire] Let's get out of here! I need more men and more weapons. We're taking a beating. We underestimated him. They're armed as well as we are. My men are getting tired of this. BOSS: Pull back and prepare for a final assault. But hold off until I give the word. There's something I want to try first. Right. How do I look? JACK MURPHY: You look good. Roll. This is Opal Brand for ME TV. I'm reporting from inside the Murphy plant, where Jack Murphy and a small band of his followers have made a valiant stand against repeated attacks by the Ratt gang. If anybody gets to see this tape, let it be known that Jack Murphy is a hero. He has all the characteristics of one. He is gentle and strong. Why are you doing this? I don't know. I want to go home, Jack. If I could-- Ifs are for dreamers. Where's Jack? It's like a bad dream, isn't it? What happens next? [sigh] I don't know. What do you want to do? I think I'm stuck with you. Well, we've got to find another way. We can't hold them off forever. We have to trick them somehow. You got something in mind? Maybe if-- look! Come on. What's your name, honey? [tires screech] It's a fucking set-up. Hey, just relax, pal. Just relax. You wouldn't want to shoot an officer of the law, would you, Mr. Murphy? Maybe I do. Who the hell are you? How do you know my name? Arbuckle, Deputy Chief. Now, do you want to give your gun to Sergeant Burns? Or do I have to have my sharpshooter put another hole in your head? [gun cocks] Get in. You stay here, honey. Don't worry. We'll bring him back to you. [car starts] What happened here? These were all brick storefronts before. Those were apartment buildings. Welcome to Newton, city reclamation project. Every sector the gangs level, the city rebuilds. Brand spanking new. Where are the people? In time, some will return. [shouting] [motorcycles revving] It's show time. [shouting] I met your father once, Jack. He could have joined us, but he decided to do things his own way. You're making the same mistake. I heard you were impressed with Newton. Yeah. I was. I still don't understand why though. City reclamation. Reconstruction. Resurrection if you will. Society has decayed beyond what can be considered controllable. We're going to revitalize the people. We have years of data on every person that ever breathed. We can weed out the undesirables. Like me. No. Not you, Jack. You're a hero now. It's not good to kill heroes. I don't want to kill you. Picture it, Jack. A new city, everyone with a purpose. It's a new beginning. And what's to keep the gangs from attacking all this? They won't. The Ratts work for me. I gave them the sewer tunnels right here on Main Street. Clever, isn't it? A vicious gang hiding right under the police building. You see, in order for me to get the kind of power I needed, I had to create a state of emergency. And when this is over, what keeps the Ratts from killing you? They'll be eliminated when they've served their purpose. [scoffs] You're crazy, Felker. It'll never work. What happens when the news finds out, when the people find out? No one ever will. We control the media. Don't you understand? We control everything. You should join me. I can use you on my team. I can give you anything you want, money, power. Am I under arrest? Technically no. Most people I lock up. I'm doing you a favor. I wish to go. I'll have you driven back in the morning. Think about what I've said, Jack. I'll give you 24 hours. 24. After that-- well, we won't consider that now. Don't look so lost, Jack. Lost? No. I think I just found what I was looking for. I hope so. I surely do. [flies buzzing] Shit. Hello! Brett! Opal! Nancy! Oh my god. I'm sorry, Nancy. [shouting] You son of a bitch! I want you to get a good look at all of this. You're a sick fuck. Yeah. I am. [grunting] You do it. Give me your hand. Pull it! Do it! Pull it! Pull! [click] Jack, thank God you're OK. I thought you were dead. Jack. They're all dead. I know. [clears throat] It's pointless. It's my fault. I am so sorry. It's not your fault. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. It's going to be OK. Jack. Jack. They're back. It's time then. [gun cocks] You think it'll work. It's my plan. Remember. Go in there, Murphy and the reporter. Let's finish this now. [explosion] You idiot. Why did you do that? It's no loss. He was ready to join us. It's over. My boys will be celebrating tonight. OPAL BRAND (ON RADIO): Join with me in a moment of silence for Jack Murphy, a hero, a knight in these dark and troubled times. Everybody's a frickin' hero. Blink and I'll blow your fucking head off. You're supposed to be dead. I got better. Where's Felker? In the hole, the sewer. Appropriate. Don't even think about it. Give me your handcuffs. Put them on. Hurry. On the wheel. Give me your keys. Don't go away. [music playing] I don't care. All I want is my cut of the pie. I fulfilled my part of the bargain. That did not include killing Murphy. Dead martyrs are hard to bury. I do not need a city full of Murphys. Felker you control the media. You do something about it. It's not my fault the idiot blew himself up. I should have killed him when I had the chance. Want to try again? [gun cocks] Murphy. I thought you were dead. JACK MURPHY: That seems to be a popular school of thought lately. Gentlemen, if you'd do me a favor, give me your guns. What kind of game are you playing, Murphy? Shut up! You had your chance. I should shoot you both. Well then why don't you? It's not my style. Should I tell your friend here what you told me? Tell me what? According to Felker here, you and your gang are slated for termination. [sigh] Felk, what you been telling the old boy here? I couldn't tell him everything. There are no Ratts, Murphy. None. What do you mean? We were brought in as specialists. Most of us are police, ex-cops. This city's become a dead end. So we volunteered. Felker wouldn't kill us. He wouldn't go against his own brotherhood. It's true, Jack. This is crazy. Cops don't kill innocent people. No. We don't. But we do what's necessary when it's necessary. Was it necessary to kill four of my friends? Murphy, you got them killed. Drop the gun. Drop it! Drop it! Shoot. And his head redecorates this wall. Shoot him. Freeze. What the hell are you doing here? Saving you for one. No shit. [gunfire] [grunting] Come on. Come on. FELKER: What are you doing? Shut up, Felker! This fight's all mine. Shall we? Jack. Stay back. Watch Felker. Come on. Ugh. [groaning] [gunshot] [gunshot] Better go after him. What do you think you're doing here? - I'm going with you. - I can't let you. Dammit, Jack. We've come this far together. Besides, I'm not missing out on the biggest story this town's ever seen. Is that what this is for you? A story? You're not coming with me. I don't need you. Jack, I wasn't finished. Would you wait? Wait! Dammit. I told you to wait. This is my fight too. Look. There he goes. [gunshot] Felker! [shouting] [music playing] You're dead. There. [gunshots] Shit. Stay back. [gunshots] It's over, Felker. It'll never be over, Murphy. It is for you. [gunshots] Felker! Felker! [cough] Don't worry, Jack. I'm still here. Things can be different, Jack. No. They can't. FELKER: You can't keep fighting the system. I can kill you right now. There's still a chance, Jack. If we work together, we could be a winning team. The game is over, Felker. Let's finish it then. [gunshots] Ugh. Ugh. [panting] [gunshot] Is this a good enough story? Yeah. But it could use a better ending. So what happens now? I don't know. It's your story. Looks like I'm stuck with you. Whatever ever happened to happily ever after? Shut up, Jack. What a fucking mess. Yeah I knew Felker couldn't handle it. I should bring my boys down. All right. I'll notify the governor. [music playing]
