(SILENCE) (SOLEMN ORGAN MUSIC) (WHIMSICAL MUSIC) (LIGHT MUSIC) MAN VOICEOVER: The holidays bring back memories. Those moments we shared with loved ones. Love transcends. I think you have the right to be afraid. Love is terrifying. When we love someone, we give them a part of your soul. And you don't get it back. Just because some silly person smiled at you just the right way. Or kiss you. (FIREWORKS POPPING) VICTOR: When I was at her house, diagnosed with a emetophobia and philophobia, do you know what those are? Emetophobia is the fear of losing someone you love and philophobia is the fear of falling in love or being loved. I've always had this fear of death. When I lost my mother, I never had the chance to say goodbye. And it made me realize that you take people for granted, you know. We're just always looking to the future. But we don't even know if they're gonna be there tomorrow. (FIRE CRACKLING) (VOICES WHISPERING OVER EACH OTHER) (FIREWORKS BOOMING AND WHOOSHING) (LIGHT DRONING MUSIC) PHOTOGRAPHER: Where's Alina at? Has anybody seen Alina? Come on, come on, get close. Everybody smile, there you go. Nice, nice, great, great, great. Thank you. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen please take your seats. The show is about to begin. (CROWD APPLAUDING) (CROWD CHATTERING) (WHIMSICAL MUSIC) Where did Alina and Victor go? Did they leave? I'm not sure. That reminds me. I need to confirm that birthdaygram for Alina. Are you gonna fire this guy today? Yes but not a word to Victor about that, huh? Of course not, honey. Why would I say something like that to Victor? I know you. I'm going to go make that phone call. All right. (CROWD APPLAUDING) Victor. Oh, Sofia, hi. We thought you and Alina left. We're about to go. Ah, is she okay? Yeah, she's fine. She should be right out. Walter told me about that little surprise you got planned for her. (CHUCKLING) I think that's so sweet. Details. Okay, sure. Sure. By the way, my lips are sealed. I hear nothing and I see nothing. Thank you for that. Walter is on the phone right now confirming your birthdaygram, boy. This one is going to be dressed as Santa. But you didn't hear that from me. Thank you for letting me know. You know, between you and me, business has been a little bit slow, and I got a feeling he's going to let some people go. But you didn't hear that, you didn't hear that from me. Keep that to yourself. (CHUCKLING) Of course. Okay. Well I better get in there cause I'm ready to pee in my panties, so, if I don't see you, Oh, we are going, - now, yeah. - Oh, okay. Well, happy holidays. And your secret's safe with me from Alina. I appreciate your discretion. Of course, you know me? I'm a coffin. I still need to go by my mom's place, is that okay? Yup. I got your mom coffee. VICTOR: Nice. Did you forget something? VICTOR: I think I left some lights on before I came and met you, yeah. ALINA: It's been vacant for a while, hasn't it? Yeah, well kind of, I guess, I've been back and forth with all the upkeep. Can you believe it's already been almost two years? ALINA: Time sure does go by fast. VICTOR: This is the place that she would always go whenever she just wanted to escape it all. I remember when she would say, "Oh, that was from your uncle Luigi" (BOTH LAUGHING) Did your dad sell Uncle Luigi's property in Italy? No. And he's not gonna if I still have any say in that. Someday were going to retire there. ALINA: We? VICTOR: Yeah. And enough space for both of us. ALINA: Well, I hope when you retire there, you grow old with someone you love. 'Cause you deserve it. (FIREWORKS BOOMING) (SANTA SIGHING) (KNOCKING) Ho ho ho, this is a birthday message from your friend, Victor Gardel. Tomorrow is your birthday, star light star, bright. Everything you do, you do right. You've shined your light each every night. For that special smile, I'll walk a mile. You know so well, you are so swell. From all of your friends we look forward to more trends. Whether in fashion or friendship, we'll always be friends. That was beautiful. I'm sorry, it's probably upset you. No, I'm fine. Just, it's really beautiful. SANTA: Well, your friend wrote it. I'm just the messenger. Thank you. I thought you had forgotten. Love you too. Victor Gardel. Roy Bacchus. That was great, thank you so much. Can I offer you something to drink? No, I don't want to interrupt anything. Nonsense, come on in. Yeah, please come in. ROY: I'm really not supposed to. Come on, we don't bite. Alina Giselle. Giselle? That's a beautiful name. What are they gonna do, fire me? How about a vodka tonic? Sorry, we're hard drinkers here. Vodka tonic's great. Thank you again. That was everything I wanted. Happy to be of service. I'll put in a good word at the agency for you. Oh, no need. Why is that? I got laid off today, agency's cutting back. I would say I am certifiably unemployed. Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not your fault. Thank you. Go and have a seat. Sorry, you gave me your name and I forgot it. I know it starts with an R. Is it Roger? Roger Rabbit. (LAUGHING) Close, but not quite. It's Roy, Roy Bacchus. That's an odd last name. Are you related to Dionysius? He's my cousin. Oh, so you come from a long line of Greek gods. Some might say so, but I'm of Roman descent. Dionysius was Greek. So the God of wine and Santa. That's me. Well I think you look very cute in the outfit. So where are you from, Roy? Imported from Tower Hamlets. East side of London. Oh yeah, okay. Are you from there originally? Born but not raised. We moved around a lot. Mom didn't like to be tied down. I'm a child of the world. So interesting. What brought you here? Oh. Well I was visiting with my girlfriend and she broke up with me, left me here. I liked it so I figured I'd stick around. Hmm. (HOLIDAY CHIMES RINGING) This is inappropriate. I really shouldn't be here, I'm sorry. Don't go, it still early. I hope we didn't say anything to offend you. ROY: No, not at all, but I really should go. (TENSE MUSIC) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) This is inappropriate? God, what a schmuck. How could I be any more pathetic? He was cute, wasn't he? (LAUGHING) Yeah, he was. I should get going as well. Gotta get up early tomorrow. No, no, no, no, stay. Come on, let's hang out. You sure? Yeah. In that case I'll walk you back there. (LIGHT MUSIC) (BASHING) Beautiful night out. Are you okay? ALINA: Yeah, why? VICTOR: You're just a little quiet. ALINA: I'm fine. VICTOR: It was nice hanging out with Walter and Sofia. ALINA: Sofia? VICTOR: Okay, maybe not Sofia. (CHUCKLING) (LIGHT MUSIC) Shh, don't. ROY: Where am I? You're in my apartment. You had a birthdaygram for my friend here earlier. Who did this to you? I'm gonna call the police. - No, don't. - Why? ROY: Just don't. Let me take you to the hospital. ROY: I'll be fine. I just need to go home. I don't think you're going anywhere tonight. I'm not your responsibility. Look, I know when people are hurt, and you my friend are hurt. You can stay here. If you feel better tomorrow you can go then. I have to work, but you're more than welcome to help yourself to anything in the fridge or the cabinets, okay? Just get some rest. Thank you. It's Victor. Victor. Victor. I'll be out of here first thing in the morning. Make sure to get better first, okay? (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) (DOGS BARKING) All right, let's see. Rhonda, Rhonda, Rhonda, how are you feeling today, any better? Well, I'll get you up and running soon, all right? Hang in there. And then there's Dollar, hey. You okay? (DOG BARKING) Hey you, I'm sorry. All right. There, you're fine. Yeah, (DROWNED OUT BY BARKING) Now that's my dog. Well, very nice, didn't ya? All right. Cleaned up now, you'll really suit up. Hey there, hi. I'm not sure yet. Pretty one, aren't ya? And my favorite, old Roscoe. Calm, be nice now with friends? All right. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Okay, yeah. No, I'll be right in. I just need to stop by the other apartment and check on things. What? How? I was just with her last night. She was doing so well. What happened? Yeah, okay. Okay I'll be ready, yeah. Bye. (VICTOR SOBBING) (WATER SPLASHING) (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) So what are you going to do? Wait till he wakes up. See what his plan is, I guess. You should take him to a hospital. I mean, what if he has a concussion or an internal bleeding? VICTOR: I know, I offered to take him, but he refused to go. So he doesn't want you to go to the cops and he won't go to the hospital. What is he, a criminal? (VICTOR CHUCKLING) Oh my gosh, what if you're harboring a fugitive? (LAUGHING) Alina. I am not harboring a fugitive and you've obviously been watching too much TV. (SIGHING) Just promise me you'll be careful. Please? I promise. Now tell me how's it going with the fashion show? It's good. The sponsors are still thinking about it, but they should be getting back to me soon. VICTOR: Nice. You should come. That is unless Santa doesn't murder you. (LAUGHING) No, I mean, you know I want to. But I have to work. My critters, they need me. Victor, you work all the time. Is it going to kill you to get one night off? It's not really about me. It's the animals, they need me. I don't know. Maybe, maybe it is for me. They make it so that I don't think about my depression. You know that I'm giving back, doing something good. (GENTLE MUSIC) (DOG BARKING) (LIGHT MUSIC) VICTOR VOICEOVER: From childhood, I remember walking around to see the holiday lights. Every year I'd walk the same path checking for any additional fixtures or lack thereof, a tradition I enjoy up to this day. No matter how trying life got, the holiday lights always brought me joy, it gave me something to look forward to. ROY: How long have I been out? Two days. Two days? Yeah. You must have really needed the sleep. How you feeling? Like I slept for two days. (GRUNTING) And like I have a bruised rib. I'm sorry I put you out. It's okay. I've been meaning to try out the couch anyways, It's not too bad. Well, I should really get going. Thank you for helping me. The world needs more people like you. So they do. Do you live nearby? No, not really. Wait. You don't have a place to go, do you? How'd you know? You were talking in your sleep. You can be honest with me. Why didn't you want me to call the police or take you to the hospital? Are you a fugitive? No, nothing like that. So what is it? Feel free to pay me back with just a little bit of honesty. You're right, I'm sorry. That's least that I can do. I came to visit and I ended up staying. My visa ended about four months ago. There's nothing for me back home. So you're an undocumented. Yeah. Well, are you hungry? I could eat. I hope you like Chinese food. I eat everything. So don't you have parents or friends who miss you? No. My mom died a few years ago. And my dad was never around. I never lived anywhere long enough to make friends. So it was always just me and my girlfriend. I'm sorry. And what happened between you two? We wanted different things. I wanted to marry her and she didn't want to be tied down. I guess that's why she's a flight attendant. And how'd you get evicted? Well, I found this place online that was willing to rent me a room, but I ended up paying both shares of the rent and it turns out she was never even paying the rent. So, hence the eviction. Wow. You have really not had the best week. I'm certainly not going to buy a lottery ticket, that's for sure. VICTOR: I wish there was something more that I can do. Listen, Victor, I don't want your pity. I don't want your charity. You have been incredibly generous with me. But I really think I should go. Where are you going to go? I mean, this is not the city to be both penniless and homeless in. Look, why don't you stay here for a couple of days? Let me call a few friends, see if anyone can help out. In the meantime, finish your dinner and open your fortune cookie. (PLASTIC RUSTLING) You know, I think, I think you've done enough, really. I wouldn't want to inconvenience you like that. Well, you already have for two days. So the way I see it now you kind of owe me. Come on, hang around. Let me see what I can do. Now what does it say? What, this? Yes, that. Nothing. VICTOR: Deep. Most of those things say the same thing. Ah, don't be so sure. What, you actually believe those things? Believe in a lot of things. Believing has helped me throughout life. So yeah, I believe. What do you believe in? I believe in fate. I believe in destiny. What about you, Roy? Do you believe in anything? I believe that I'm here now. See, there you go. You believe in something. That's true. So tell me about your friend. Who, Alina? Yeah. What about her? Are you guys like a couple? (CHUCKLING) No. Nothing like that. I mean, we were lovers for about a day. But that did not work out. We talked and we realized pretty quickly that we made much, much better friends. She's cute. VICTOR: Yeah, yeah she is. Now listen, I think that you should stay here until you fully recover. I'm gonna make some calls, let me see what I can do. With the economy the way it is, you really just should not be out there wandering around. Well, I can't argue with that. I will repay you, seriously. VICTOR: How do you intend to do that? (SIGHING) I don't know. I could run some errands, clean your apartment. Well, that is very kind of you, but I really rather you didn't just 'cause I have everything in its place and I'm kind of particular about that. But look. It's getting late, I have a big day tomorrow. You should get some rest. Okay. (VICTOR LAUGHING) Thank you, really. VICTOR: Yeah, of course. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) ALINA: So what are you gonna do? So he doesn't wanna go to the cops and he won't go to the hospital. Oh my gosh, what if you're harboring a fugitive? ROY: Thank you for helping me. The world needs more people like you. Well I am so sorry, you're right, there's just nothing I can do. I'm undocumented. VICTOR: Don't you have parents or friends who miss you? ROY: No, not really. My mother died a few years ago and my dad was never around. VICTOR: You cleaned. ROY: I didn't have anything to do so I figure I'd put my hands together. Hey. ROY: All right. You made breakfast. I made bakes. They're my own recipe. So Victor, I was thinking. So was I. But sorry, I interrupted you, go ahead. No, please, you go ahead. Well. Go on, get it out with. I was thinking that there might be a way for you to stay here legally without the risk of deportation. ROY: Okay. What have you got? VICTOR: Well, I was thinking. (LAUGHING) ROY: Go on. I was thinking that civil union is legal here now for people of the same gender. And if we were to get married, then you could stay. Oh. - It's probably a stupid idea. - Okay. I'm not like that. Food for thought. I was just thinking it today. It was probably a stupid idea. Sorry. Yeah, I can't think about this right now. I'm sorry, I should go. Roy, no, Roy. I wasn't... No, Roy, I wasn't, trying to... Roy! Why'd I say that? (SOMBER MUSIC) So stupid. ♪ I could see the tears ♪ ♪ Breathing in your lungs ♪ ♪ Afraid that love will find ♪ ♪ This together ♪ ♪ I could see my room ♪ ♪ Shaking in your eyes ♪ ♪ Deep in loving eyes ♪ ♪ Is to give ♪ Espanol or Ingles? Ingles. Okay. So Mr. Victor Gardel, I see that you're a Zonian from the Canal Zone. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I grew up there myself. Went to Balboa High School actually. Oh you're kidding, small world. Well, I've reviewed your application and with the County clerk, I'll be issuing your civil union certificate. You're here today for the civil ceremony. And I must tell you that there's many duties and responsibilities of a civil union partnership. First I assume you're both the legal age. Yes. And you're both here of your own free will to engage in this civil union. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. You've met all the prerequisites for the celebration of this union. So therefore the state has decided to approve your request. Thank you. First I must ask, are there any objections that either of you may have that might prevent us from being able to continue with these proceedings? No. Okay. Well, now's the time to speak up if there is anything. Otherwise you'll be bound by the amended resolution 2-56 and the articles that I'm about to read to you. Article 66 states that by entering into this partnership, both of you understand that you will share the same rights and responsibilities as any other regular couple with your status. Article 67 states that you both agree to respect and make this union work for the benefit of both parties and in the interest of your union. And that you will look after each other's wellbeing and to protect each other until the passing of one or the other. And finally, article 68 states that by your own free will you have agreed to enter into this union. You promise to be faithful to one another, to share the responsibilities of any ascendants or descendants in your care. And most importantly, to look out for the wellbeing of your newly created family. Okay. So now we've reached the moment for each of you to confirm your reason for being here. Mr. Victor Gardel, do you agree to join into the civil union with Mr. Roy Bacchus? I do. Mr. Roy Bacchus, do you agree to join into this civil union with Mr. Victor Gardel? I do. Okay. Well, you may exchange rings. Great. Well, by the power vested in me, I now declare this civil union to be legitimate by law. Congratulations to both of you. Oh and one final thing. I'll need each of you to sign this notarized document that will allow you to complete the process of the certificate and this civil union. Congratulations. You may now kiss your spouse. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Home sweet home. This is so tight. I did not think that you were gonna be able to keep a straight face. Yeah, I didn't either. We should celebrate. I don't have any champagne. I only get it for new year's. It's okay. We can celebrate with this. Whiskey, okay. To the new Mr. Gardel. Hey, I did not give up my last name. Okay. How does it feel to be Mr. Bacchus? Well, hold on. I did not decide on that either, sir. Thank you. Fine, I will be Mr. Gardel for tonight. I do really want to say how much I appreciate what you've done for me. No, it's big. It's really big for anybody to do for anyone. Especially somebody that they just met a few days ago. What I'm trying to say is that I'm grateful. And it says a lot about who you are as a person. Who would that? Someone kind. Somebody generous, selfless. Well, I would not have done this if I didn't think that you were pretty special yourself. All right. May I have this dance? Now you're really making me feel like Mr. Bacchus. Hey, it's only for one night. And besides, it's Christmas Eve. How many wedding nights do you get to have on Christmas Eve? None. One wedding! (CHUCKLING) One. So let's make it count. (GENTLE VOCAL MUSIC) This is nice. Thank you. For what? For everything. Have you done this before? No. Have you? VICTOR: No. So what do we do now? Like, get some sleep. I have to work in the morning. On Christmas? Come on, it's our wedding night. We should hang. Shouldn't we go to sleep so Santa can bring our presents? If we're awake- - I am Santa. And Santa says that we celebrate. We have celebrated. And this has been really fun, but, we drank a lot. It's been a long day, I think we should get some rest. Fine. You don't have to sleep on the couch. VICTOR: Where are you gonna sleep? We share the bed. VICTOR: You okay with that? What kind of spouse would I be if I let my husband sleep on the couch on his wedding night? (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) I had a great time tonight. Me too. I like you. I know. So what do we do now? I don't know. I don't want to hurt you. You won't. I don't want to do anything that you don't want to. You won't. Are you awake? No. This feels good. Can we do this again? I don't want to lead you on. I did this for you. I know. I know you liked me like this. I just, I needed you to know that it's not always going to be like this. I understand. I'm gonna take a bath. (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC) (ROY SIGHING) Victor. I'm sorry. I don't really know what I'm doing. There's no need to apologize, I mean. We had a deal and we just had a little bit more fun than we had planned. It's not like that. Let's make a pact. What kind of a pact? If anything happens, no matter what happens, we'll always be friends. You got it. Would you promise me something? Sure. Promise that if anything ever happened to either one of us, that we would be there for each other. Okay, done. Hold on, I'm not finished. I've always had this fear of death. That's a little normal. Yeah, but this is for real. Okay, I'm sorry. When I lost my mother, I never had the chance to say goodbye. And it made me realize that we take people for granted. We're just always looking to the future. But we don't even know if they're going to be there tomorrow. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I don't plan on going anywhere tomorrow. Would you promise me one more thing? ROY: Yeah. If anything was ever to happen to you, that you would give me some sort of sign or a signal that just let me knew that you were around? And how would you like me to do that? I don't know. Play with my keys, make the lights flicker. I mean, just something, so that I know you're there. I could email you, how does that work? I'm being serious here. Okay. Yeah, the light flickering. That sounds good. And the keys, I'll do that too. I'll even put in a little bit of my soul. So you know I'm always there. And would you look after me? Of course. Now let's stop talking about death. Enjoy this moment. VICTOR: I am enjoying this moment. Okay. I'm enjoying it very much. Listen, I have to visit my father. Would you consider joining me? Yeah, where is he? He's at his office. How about breakfast first? That sounds good. Okay, still a little too sticky. So we're going to get a little bit of flour. Not a lot, just a little bit. Okay. You're looking for the right consistency. Not a lot, just a little. You want it to be not sticky, but not too dry. If it's too dry it gets really crumbly. Okay. So once you got the right consistency, that feels pretty good. We're going to ball that up. VICTOR: Just roll it? Yep, just roll it just like that. Take that. Okay, now we're gonna roll it. Rolling, rolling, rolling. We're gonna flatten that out and make them to like little disks. That's the bake. - Yeah. - Okay. That's it? That's it. And then we toss it in there. Yeah, just like a little frisbee. There you go. VICTOR: Oh, that isn't hard. No, it's super easy. Nice. Too thick in the middle? ROY: Ah, a little bit. There's another one. VICTOR: Thank you. (VICTOR SIGHING) ROY: It's pretty easy, right? Yeah. Last but not least. That's it? That's it. Pretty simple right? Yeah, and from there, okay. It's actually a really weird flour. I think there's something in the flour. What, no. Yeah. (ROY LAUGHING) Seriously? Oh my god. No, no, yeah. (LIGHT MUSIC) I think I'm just gonna wait here. Yeah, okay, it's probably best. You okay? Yeah. But I don't want to do this. Relax, it'll be fine. I'll be here when you get back. (DOOR SHUTTING) DAD: What about your lady friend? You have fine receivers with any of them? VICTOR: No, nothing really going on with that. I'm still really close with Alina but nothing there. DAD: Nothing for now but, don't you have any plan to get involved with some nice girl in where you live? VICTOR: No plans right now. Just working a lot and keeping busy and I'm spending a lot of time with my good friend Roy. DAD: I remember one time you told me you met a nice girl, you were going out. What happened? VICTOR: Yeah I mean, I've met lots of nice girls. It's just, you know, none of it took, really wasn't. It wasn't that sort of relationship. You know, I need some grandsons. I am alone, I need grandsons. I depend on you on that. I don't know (MUMBLING) when that'll come about, but you never know. DAD: Here, you go to a bar and you meet a very nice girl and bring me some good news next time, okay? VICTOR: Well actually, I mean, I do have some pretty good news. My friend Roy really needed some help. But what, I don't understand. I want to hear from your girlfriend, not your friend. You did what?! Are you out of your mind? Papa, I did it to help a friend. Perdita had a son! Out! Get out! I want no part of this! Well, Merry Christmas to you too! I can't believe you would do something like that. (VICTOR SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Your mother would be shamed of you. (DAD SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (TENSE MUSIC) (VICTOR SIGHING) How'd it go? Not well. That bad? That bad. Tell you what. I have this special spot that I always go when I get stressed. Let's go. (SOMBER GUITAR MUSIC) Was he always like that? I've never seen him like that before. ROY: All my fault? It is not your fault. Look, this was a long time coming. He's always been like that, just so controlling. I'm tired of it. I'm my own man and my own person. I'm a homewrecker. My mother would be so proud. Is there anything I can do? Maybe I can talk to him. Wouldn't do any good. Do you work for him? Sometimes, I mean, kind of. He manages my mother's estate and I co-manage different assets and ventures with him. Alina is one of the ventures. But really, my joy, my passion, is my day job, working with the rescues. I'm a rescue. Do I bring you joy? Yeah. Good. Good, at least I'm good for something. So how do you manage Alina? Oh my God, Alina. I totally forgot we're supposed to have dinner at her house tonight. Why didn't you say so earlier? Listen, I have a present. I have a bottle of wine. I can give you that to give so you don't show up empty-handed. Okay. Yeah, it's okay? - Yeah. - All right. (KNOCKING) Hello? Merry Christmas. (GASPING) Merry Christmas. ROY: Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I hope you like merlot. It's my favorite. Thank you. Please make yourselves at home. VICTOR: Thank you. I was just finishing up here in the kitchen. So sorry, running a bit late. VICTOR: Oh, not at all. Totally the ones who were late. Nonsense, you actually gave me more time to prepare dinner. Perfect. So I'd never seen him quite that angry before. Sounds awful. You guys had quite the day. Yeah well, you know him, I was never the son that he wanted and now this is just one more big reason why. Well your mother would be proud of the man you've become. Thank you. All that matters is that we're here together now. Victor, Merry Christmas. Thank you. And Roy, this is for you. Oh my god. I don't know what to say, I didn't bring anything. It's okay, you brought the wine, that's good enough. Yeah this is sort of our thing. We both really love the holidays so we kind of go crazy. Thank you. Speaking of, I think that you are really going to love that. And Roy. Roy, that is for you. Victor. It's nothing, just open it. Are these keys to your apartment? Victor, I can't accept this. Yeah, you can. Now, open mine. (WRAPPER RIPPING) You okay, Roy? What's wrong? When I was a little kid, I never got to celebrate holidays. My mom always struggled for work. I would always go out and let her in, hope to find presents and things. But it was always just me. This has always kind of been a dream of mine. Well we are very blessed to have you here with us this Christmas, Roy. Right, Alina? Yes, of course. Thank you for this. It's our pleasure. Can I use your bathroom? Of course. My home is your home. It's down the hall. He's so sweet. Isn't he? Listen, I wanted to ask you. He could really use some work and I wondered if maybe there was some sort of fit for him in the gallery. I'm sure I can find something. - Yeah? - Yeah. VICTOR: That means so much to me, thank you. That'll be amazing. Anything for you. Thank you. Well. Welcome back. Feeling better? Much, thank you. You know, I could use some help with the gallery in case you're looking to make some extra cash. I'm producing the fashion show there and I can use a hand. Doesn't pay much, but it'll help you get back on your feet. I would love that, thank you. Welcome. Come back tomorrow around nine a.m.? Yeah, great. Looks like it's your lucky day. A toast. To new friends, old friends. May we all get everything set to see. (GLASSES CLINKING) Cheers to all. (HOLIDAY MUSIC) Ladies and gentlemen, and now a visual feast for your eyes. Escargot.

From the book of Genesis, our Adam sports emerald organic acids with sparkling green beads, in an attempt to hide his manhood from the ever increasing powers of seduction. Thank you, as well. Please put your hands together and let's give a round of applause to our magnificent models for all sporting the Escargot fantasy collection from Saks. We take this opportunity to remind you these confessions will be on display for your viewing pleasure at the gallery during the week. (ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC) (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) Roy, thank you so much for your help. You did it. Amazing and awesome. I really enjoyed it. Thank you. Would you like to go out for a drink? I would like that. (LIGHT MUSIC) (ICE CLINKING) (WHIRRING) (SOMBER MUSIC) You're home. Yeah, I was waiting for you. Is everything all right? Yeah. Elena's setting up for new year spread and I came to pick you up. VICTOR: Oh, right. Okay, let me just take a quick shower. Actually, there is something that I need to talk to you about. Okay, yeah, what's going on? I proposed to Alina last night. She said yes. Oh. Congratulations. That's great news. No, no, I'm really happy for you guys. That's excellent. Really happy for you. It's all thanks to you. You brought us together. Sounds like Cupid was hard at work. Are you okay with this? Victor, we'll still see each other. Maybe not as often as we used to. I get it. I take it you'll be moving soon? Yeah, I'll be by to pick up my stuff this week. I know it's sudden and we're obviously gonna have to figure out the divorce paperwork. But that doesn't matter right now. I can still come by and cook breakfast every now and then. Nothing's going to change. I saw this day coming. Congratulations, really. I understand, congratulations. ROY: Come here. I'm fine. Stop. Stop, look at me. I love you. I will always love you. I will never forget what you did for me. But Alina's my soul. I understand. I love Alina, I love you. And there's nothing that makes me happier than knowing that two of my favorite people are going to spend their lives together. Part of me just still wishes it was me. I know. I know. I didn't wanna drop all this on you today. I just thought it was best. Yeah, it probably was. Why don't you go take a shower and get ready? We don't want to be late. It was very thoughtful of you guys to invite me over but I think I'm just going to lay low tonight. I'm feeling really tired. Are you sure? Yeah. But you should go. You don't want to keep Alina waiting. You will always have a special place in my heart. It was fun, wasn't it? Yeah. Victor. May I kiss you goodbye? (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC) You should go. You are so worrying.

Yeah. Sure, is everything all right? Right now? All right. Yeah, I'm on my way. Remember you told me when you were a child, how much you loved Christmas and believed in Santa Claus, and how you refuse to believe he didn't exist? How you would hide under a dining room table, waiting for him to eat the cookies and drink the milk you left for him under the tree? And how you would fall asleep under the table, waiting for him. And one night you woke up to find your mom going back and forth under the tree? Yeah, I remember, I thought that she was checking to see what presents Santa had brought her. I always romanticize your story in my head hoping one day I could be the mom to that child, making sure he always believed even when the other kids didn't anymore, because they had outgrown that fairy tale. And when he was a grown man, he and his wife would come home for the holidays to visit his aging parents. And I'd always be there to prepare the holiday spread that we used to enjoy as a family. I remember. Victor. I no longer think that's in the cards for Roy and I. What she's trying to say is that we've been trying to have a baby, but we're having difficulty conceiving. We've been to the doctors and it's me. I can't have kids. Have you two considered adoption? Maybe that is an option. I mean, there are so many children who would love a wonderful family like yours. We have. Victor, the reason that we actually called you here is there was something we wanted to ask you. VICTOR: Okay. We were wondering if, you would be our surrogate. You want me to donate sperm? Actually we want our baby to be conceived naturally. We kind of had something else in mind. We would like for you to be part of the experience. Alina, do you realize what your husband is asking me to do? Roy, I told you he wouldn't go for this. Victor, let's just forget this happened, okay? I mean it's our problem, so we'll deal with it. It's my idea. I thought because you guys have been intimate before that maybe it would be a way to connect all of us. I mean, would you be present? I'll do it. Wait, really? Are you sure? Yeah, yeah. Would you like to have a drink first? Wait, now? Oh. Then yes. Probably several. (LIGHT GUITAR MUSIC) Okay. So how do we actually do this? This is awkward, isn't it? Yeah, a little bit. Like it still doesn't wanna work. ROY: What can I do? ALINA: More wine, yeah. VICTOR: Guys, this is crazy, are you sure that you actually thought this through? Thank you. I'm here for you. (VICTOR MOANING) I know they were somewhere around here. They must've fallen out of my pocket, ALINA: Honey, don't forget your bag. I'm going as quick as I can. Got it. Are you sure you're going to be okay? Positive. Now go break a leg. I love you. I love you too. We'll be fine. Now, go.
