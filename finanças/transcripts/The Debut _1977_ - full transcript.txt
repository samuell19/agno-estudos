THE DEBUT Asshole! NO CYCLING Hey, Tanja. -He's coming. Him? -Yes. Hello. Carolien Sanders. Sit down. Hello, do you want tea? No, we have to do some work. Hugo and Rita are coming to the Netherlands, this Christmas. Oh, nice. Can you see them? -What's taking so long? I forgot what they look like. Is that them? -I think so. Yes, that's them. She looks beautiful. Hello. Where's Carolien? I don't know. -Carolien, come. They're here. Come, Carolien. Hello. Hello. -Hi, darling. It's so good to be here. You're so thin. -I didn't do anything for it. Fantastic. Hello, darling. We're going to have a great time. Hello Anne. -Hugo. Hello, darling. You look great. Where's little Carolien? -Carolien, where are you? Hey, Carolien. Let go of me. I'm not a child anymore. You're not? -No. You've become quite the lady. She's not really a lady, more a boy. Are you coming, guys? You should have worn a thicker coat. -Yes, I'm a bit cold. Where's the car? -There. Great that you're here, darling. Anne! -Grey and wet. You won't believe how much I've missed that. Rita, are you coming? Would you like to order? My husband made reservations for six and we'd like to wait for him. Would you like a drink? 7 Up. Do the other ladies want to order something too? A Campari soda, please. And you, Rita? -A sherry with ice. Rita, that's been a long time. Yes. -Eight years? Seven. -Seven! You didn't tell them you were here? -No, don't worry. Old chap. -Peter. You're looking good. -A couple of years older. You too, old buddy. Seven years in Zambia adds up. Especially in that heat. A pity Van Der Berg never finished that research. Did he have a personal reason? -He died. He died? Rita... I didn't know. He sent us a New Year card. Carolien, behave. Eat normally. You're not in the zoo. Leave the child be. She'll have time enough to behave. Show me your hands. A cheat sheet. Go wash your hands. Go! Uncle Hugo, can I have some duck? In Zambia, they eat rice with their hands. Show me how to do it. -Make a scoop with your hands. Pull it to the side. Pick it up with your thumb. -I'll do it too. Your wife has become a real native. You must have had a good time. Rita, did you like it there? Did you enjoy Zambia? Enjoy? -Yes. Yes... except... I have... Don't tell us you were homesick. -No. She must be tired from the trip. Right, Mouse? Look at this. Such bullshit. What's that? It's beautiful. Those people from Zambia gave it to me. The colors are beautiful. Do you want it? -No, keep it. It is beautiful. Let me try it on. -You like it, I don't. So beautiful. Isn't he a hunk? I'll go see him. Are you coming? Have you got a cigarette for me? -Yes. Do you want to come to my party? I'd like to. Can I bring someone? Yes, fine. Who? Carolien. -Yes, fine. Jacques invited me to his party and you can come too. What do I want with all those guys? It'll be very wild and late. You know what Jacques' parties are like. Yeah, right. No, I don't want to go. Bring someone then. Kees, for instance. Kees. I've been invited to a party. Do you want to come too? Yes? Ok. Dad, I want to ask something. Can't you see I'm working? Yes, but I have to ask something. Does it have to be now? -Yes. I've been invited to a party and I'd like to go. Would that be alright? Do what you want. But it goes all night. I'll have to spend the night. Spend the night? -Yes. What does your mother say? -I want to know what you think. I told you I was working. Sanders speaking. Hello, how are you? Headache... where exactly? Have you got a temperature? What did you say? Yes. I'll be there in 15 minutes. No, you don't need to worry. Bye. Dad, is it alright? -Is what alright? The party and spending the night there. If your mother agrees, I do too. Is your mother home? -She has choir rehearsals. And Peter? -Dad just went to a patient. I'm here. -We're having a look at a place. The hotel's driving me crazy. I thought Anne might... Hugo doesn't have a clue either. I can come. -Sure, if you like. I'd love to. This apartment, or palace, is the best we have on offer. The kitchen. This is for very special cases. I'm warning you. When you enter, you won't want to leave. Would you mind closing the door behind you? So we can all savor the intimate atmosphere of the apartment. We always try to please people who come back on leave. Here we have special sitting comfort. Such a joy to sit here. Listening comfort. Stereo, tape deck, records. This is beautiful. -I see your wife knows what I mean. I've always wanted something like this. -We don't show this to just anyone. What a joy to sit here. -Quite right, young lady. And if the gentleman agrees, please sit at this huge dining table... that can also serve as your work table. So we can discuss the rental contract. -My wife will do that. Could you tell me where the toilet is? -The toilets. This house offers various options. The first one is in the hallway, next to the kitchen. This toilet is also a joy to sit on. Who spreads light, spreads friendship. Hugo, Hugo. What a joy to sit here. What a joy to lie here. What a joy to sit here. What a joy to lie here. You look very different like this. In which way? -Just different. Nice? How long have you known uncle Hugo and aunt Rita? Daddy has known Hugo since he went to university. For fourteen or fifteen years. Since before I was born. -Yes. Yes, I remember now. I was pregnant with you. I was still in your belly. When I think about it... You were always moving around. When you'd decide to play football... Why don't Hugo and Rita have any children? You both need to want it. And why do they live in Zambia? Hugo had wanted that for a long time. He insisted on going to Africa. So he went. And what about Rita? She could hardly stay here on her own. I think she's been pretty lonely there. Do you think they love each other? Give me a hand. -There we go. And now we all wave. All wave. Look, guys, the sea! Let's glide down here. What a wind! -Yes. Great, two of those girls. They keep you young. Although I never know where I stand with her. Do you know what she said to me? -What? Mum, I might have to start taking the pill. Does she have a boyfriend? -I don't think so. She calls the boys in her school losers. Isn't she a bit young? Come on, Hugo. Go, Carolien! -Run, Hugo! Can I get on your back? -Yes, go on. Higher. You smell good. I think you're really sweet. -Yes? Yes, thank you! Well done. Stay like that for a sec. Hello. -Hello, darling. Carolien, you here? We're working. She has to do a project about developing countries. I'm trying to help her. Oh, nice. Shall I make you some tea? -No...yes. I'll do it myself. Alright then. Here's a lovely cup of tea. Saucers. Shall I pour? -No, I'll do that. Klutz. There's no... stupid. -I'll make tea. You can't leave anything to men. Why are you here? -I wanted to see you. You're such a strange girl. This is my school. -Oh, nice. We'll have to climb over. -We can't do that. Didn't you want to see my school? Or are you scared? Come on. You're not scared, are you? Come, Hugo. Let me go first. One, two... This way. I did leave one open. There. This is my school. The gym. It's been a long time. It still smells exactly the same. You have to take off your shoes in the gym. Hey Carolien, look at me. I learnt this in Zambia. This is how I always go to work. From vine to vine through the jungle. And you're never in a traffic jam. Do you know what I can do? Fly. Do you want to come to my party tonight? And you too? My parents are on holiday. Come on, guys. I won't do it. It's full of people. Come on, you'll be fine. Don't be so childish. Don't forget, I'm behind you. Get ready. Good luck. -Thanks. Tell me, little angel, is it yours? Have you been naughty with your fiancé? And you didn't keep an eye on the calendar? New little mother... you're not married. What to do now? The child was born in one piece... because the abortion clinic had been closed. Thanks for this life, dear Minister of Justice. Can I talk to you for a moment? Yes, Mr Doesburg? -Mr De Leeuw. What a relief that it went so well. And now the party. Can I, for a moment? Where are you going? What's the rush? I'm going. I'm not coming. But we were going to go together. -Yes, but I changed my mind. Strange. And what about Kees? Kees can do without me. It sucks. Where are you going then? That's none of your business. Hello. -Hello. What a nice car. I wanted to rent a golden coach for you, but I hope this pleases the lady too. It's just passable. Good. I always have to sit in the back. But you're quite a lady now. And where did this lady want to go? To bed, to bed, said the little red hen. First for some food, replied the little rooster. Where can we get some, said the little hen. I know something really good. -That sounds excellent. Good evening, you made reservations for two? Please follow me. You can sit here. Thank you. Carolien, sit down, please. The menu. Have you made a choice? We'll share a Chateaubriand jardinière, with a bottle of Côte de Beaune. And we'll start with scallops. I'd take that too. It's very good. No, I want cuisses de grenouille. Cuisses de grenouille, excellent. What is that? -Frogs' legs. Yuck. Don't you like that? -No. Why did you order it then? It looked so good. The principal didn't like that we mentioned things like abortion. But it was a very good song. -Yes? Was it a Christmas carol? -Yes. So how did it go? Tell me, little angel, is it yours? Have you been naughty with... -Quiet, Carolien, please. You can't do that in a place like this. You have to behave. Look, I've got something for you. Like it? Yes? And this? What is it? -Lipstick. Lipstick? Fantastic, flowers and champagne. Flown over from Reims, just for you. It's a present from Jean-Paul. Very beautiful. Sweetheart, what am I going to do with you? It's not possible. -Why not? You can't stay away all night. -But my parents know about it. What? Not about you and me but that I won't be home tonight. Can I get number 128622? Hello, Mouse. Did I wake you up? You'll never guess where I am. No, in my old fraternity. I met an old uni friend. So we talked and had some drinks. I was legless. So don't worry. I'll be with you soon. See you soon. Bye, kiss. Bye, Mouse. Good morning. Did you sleep well? I didn't hurt you, did I? Shit, I lost my virginity. I lost my virginity! Carolien, what are you doing? I lost my virginity! Have you been naughty with your fiancé? Hey, Carolien. Where have you been? How was it? -Very good. His parent's weren't home. He took me to the balcony and you can guess the rest. But where were you? -I lost my virginity. What? -In a hotel room. Jesus, Carolien! Did it hurt? -No, not at all. What about the blood? You don't look pale. Blood? One little stain. But who were you with? Do I know him? I'd rather not say. -But I'm your best friend. Ok, his name's Hugo. Is he from our school? No, he's a friend of my father. A friend of your father? So is he married with a family? What is it to you? -What is it to me? You can't let an old fart take you to a hotel room. Yuck! You don't understand it. -I'm glad I don't. Old man fucker! Consultation for... What are you doing there? -Nothing. What do you want with this? -Nothing. Anne, can you come right away? Here, your youngest daughter's newest toy. Tell us why you want it. Don't get so worked up. There's nothing wrong. I'm getting worked up? Yes, right. Did you want me to give her the pill and say who cares? She clearly cares or she wouldn't be looking for the pill. Do you want her to get pregnant? -I want her to stay away from it. I want her to wait. She's way too young. Or do you think it's normal? What's normal? I don't care about normal. A woman should have had a regular period for at least a year. She's had it for two years. Two years! A 14 year old is much more prone to side effects. They're bad for her growth, her development... And I haven't even started on the moral, ethical side of things. She should follow Suzan's example. She's three years older but she'd never do this. Right, that helps her a lot. If you want to raise your children in a modern way, go ahead. But I won't be part of it. Carolien, Carolien! I made an appointment for you. Just show them this note. They won't ask difficult questions. They sounded very nice. They'll give you a check-up and then they recommend what's best for you. Do you want me to come? You really don't? -No. Keep it in a safe place. Nobody needs to know. This is between us, alright? Carolien, if something's wrong, you can tell me. No, nothing's wrong. Hello. -Mum's not home. I didn't come for her. Hi Rita. Come in. I'm right on time. Hello, Hugo? Now we'll make a real lady out of you. Let it go down. Careful. Now put your arms through. Other side. Right. Hold in your tummy. Yes. Don't you think it looks good? -Yes. We'll take it. -Can I keep it on? That's 250. Thank you. And fifty back. -Thank you. I hope your daughter will enjoy it. I have a present for you. -You do? What is it? -The pill. So we can go to bed with each other as often as we want. I have a present for you too. We won't go back to Zambia for the time being. We'll be staying for a while. There. No, put it back. What shall I put on? Suzan is crazy. You're crazy. Guys, really. Rita and Hugo will be arriving soon. Get off the table and get dressed. Don't we look yummy? Do you all want an apple turnover? I wrote to you about it. -Yes, that they were a complete failure. They're lovely, darling. Do you want a turnover, dad? I'd love a turnover. Haven't had one for years. Do you feel like a beach walk? A beach walk? He's just like a schoolboy in love. Last week he brought me this. Just like that? No, not just like that. Can you get the screen? Sit down, guys. Yes, we're coming. -I'll sit there. I'll turn off the light. Carolien, can you turn off the light? Show us your camera skills, Peter. I'm only an amateur. She needs a hand. And then you start to wave. Sit down, Carolien. That was a great day. That's when those things appear. There they are. They're like two big birds, chasing each other. This is where she jumps. Look. She tries to get them. Beautiful, those blue kites against the grey sky. They used to do that back in the day, remember? Go Hugo, don't let her beat you. Take a bow. Hello madam, hello sir. Good isn't it, Hugo? -Beautiful. Beautiful. -Yes, fantastic. Keep the glasses together. It's very bubbly, isn't it? Damn. Suzan, give me a new tape. I'll be in time, guys. Keep the glasses together. Yes, I'm ready. Alright. 11... 12... happy New Year! Happy New Year! Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. -And now the fireworks! Don't go outside yet. I have to tell you something. Something really good. A surprise. Hugo thinks I shouldn't tell you yet. He's afraid it's not certain. But it is, isn't it? As certain as can be. -So, what is it? You're wearing a new dress. -Yes, that too. You look radiant. -Thank you. Now guess. You're not... -Yes. Really? -I'm pregnant. That's fantastic for you. And you knew all this time? -Professional confidentiality. Carolien, why do you look like that? Why don't you congratulate Rita? -Why should I? Why should I congratulate Rita just because she needs to have a baby? Every minute, a hundred thousand babies are born in the world. All this fuss over nothing. Nonsense! Oh well, she's got another one of her tantrums. Let's just blame it on her age. Suzan, can you get the coats? -Yes, ok. Shall we go into the garden for the fireworks? Guys, I'll go and see her. Shall I go instead? -Would you? Rita, I have to tell you something too. I have a surprise for you. Are you listening? It's a secret that I... Have you gone crazy, hypocrite? I'll tell Rita everything. -I don't want you to tell her anything. You'd make her unhappy for the rest of her life. You're such a hypocrite! I'm not a hypocrite. -Let go of me. Carolien, listen. -You are a hypocrite. Listen, be quiet. I wanted to tell you way earlier. I didn't know how. Don't you understand how happy Rita is with this? It's not easy for me either. Don't you understand? Carolien. Hello. -Hello, what's wrong? I'm ashamed about how I behaved on New Year's Eve. It's ok. When I was your age, I often snapped too. And nobody understood. We all get confused sometimes. It's such a change for us. Hugo a father. It's really on his mind, in his way. He's gone a lot. This weekend as well. I don't mind. I understand. A man doesn't react the same way as a woman. I really admire that you came over. Do you want a drink? -No, I'm going straight home. Ok, bye. -Bye. What are you doing? -I'm undressing you. Don't do it, Carolien. We're going to Belgium. Friendly people, but impossible to understand. That's dangerous. Customs. Anything to declare? Yes, horny little girls. Did you bring your passport? -I don't have one yet. Stay low then. Stay low! Sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, hundred. Can I look now? No, you can't look. It has to be a surprise. A bit longer. We're almost there. Shit, it's closed. -Is that the surprise? What do we do now? -Find another hotel. Do we have a double room for madam and sir? Yes, we have one more left. Show the gentleman the way. Please follow me. children under 15, cannot use this elevator unaccompanied Good night, sir. Thank you, sir. The key's in the door. A double room for madam and sir. Sounds like a Belgian joke. All alone in a hotel. Exciting, isn't it? Did you see how that man looked at us? And he was right. We'll make this a good weekend, Hugo. Damn! To give us this room in the off-season. That's what you get. -From what? From smuggling horny little girls. You just wait. You're about to experience something. Come on, Hugo, do something. Come on, Hugo. Come, doggie. Hugo! I've got some chocolate for you. -Put it down your own trap. What's wrong with you? -Didn't we have a good time? Yes, but you can't call this a hotel. No? What kind of nonsense is this? I'm not a little child anymore. Where are we going? Home. You don't want to stay in that stupid hotel, do you? It wasn't a stupid hotel and I don't want to go home. Do you know something better? Who were you calling just now? Rita. I promised. Promised? Couldn't she go without you again? Come on. Carolien, come on. Sit in the front. No. Don't be so childish and come sit here. No. Hey, stop! Carolien, what are you doing? I'm putting on my own clothes. You're such a crazy girl. How can I stay angry with you? Shall we do something fun after all? -Yes, but what? If I think of something really fun, will you come along? Yes, of course. -Ok, we'll do something really fun. Tanja! -Hey! I brought Hugo. There. I'll introduce him to you. Hugo, this is Tanja. -Hello, I'm Tanja. Hi. -Hello. Carolien, stop that for a moment and come here. Talk to me for a moment. -Let go of me. Let go of me, dammit! Jacques, Carolien left with that guy. What should we do? Carolien. -Let go of me! Carolien, please. -No. I love you. -No! Let go of me! -Don't act like this! I don't want you to dance like that. Listen to me. I'm not listening! I won't do what you want! I'm not Rita. Let go of me! I'll do what I want! Carolien! Is Carolien late for breakfast again? -She was home very late, last night. Where was she? At Tanja's. Do you want more tea? Can you pass me the sugar? When does your Christmas holiday end? -In a couple of days. I feel like going to school again. -Good, you have lots of holidays. Not that many. -Good morning, Carolien. Hi. Good morning, Carolien? -How was it? How was what? -Staying overnight at Tanja's. It was fun. What did you guys do? -All kinds of things. Very interesting. Fascinating report. We went bowling and we went to a disco. We had a good time. Yeah, it shows in your face. As if you look so cheerful. I don't ask you all these questions all the time either. Mind your own business, please. Yes, that will do. Sanders speaking. -Jacques speaking. Is Caroline home? Yes, one moment. For you. -Who is it? Someone called Jacques. Hello. -I found your sweater in the disco. Shall I bring it over tomorrow, on my new motorcycle? That's nice of you. -Ok, I'll see you tomorrow. A beautiful house. -Yes, I live here. Are you coming in for a drink? -Yes. Weren't you afraid when I went fast? -No, I want a motorbike when I'm 18. Well, well. Come in. -Had a party? Yes. -What a mess. Didn't you clean up? -Why? Because it looks bad. Do you want a drink? -Yes, what do you have? Is seven up alright? -Yes, fine. How's Tanja? -I don't know. Why don't you know? Did you two break up? Yes, as far as I'm concerned. Tanja's so childish and inexperienced. You should hear her about you. -About Hugo no doubt. Yes, I think she's jealous. -Why would she be? She's crazy if she's jealous of me. I don't get it. Maybe because you do things she doesn't do, but wants to do. What kind of man is that friend of yours? He's got a screw loose. He thinks he can tell me what to do. He acts like he is my father. No. -Is he married? Yes, I was fed up with that too. Always sneaking around. That always happens with married men. Always afraid to lose their wives, but in the meantime they grab what they can. That's not true. It wasn't like that. We were really crazy about each other. Don't worry, girl. There are more men in the world. Let go of me, idiot! No! -Come here! Old men, right? No! No! back to school! Stretch your legs. Good, that's the way. Hey Carolien, how did you go with that old guy? I broke up with him. Good, everybody was freaking out in the disco. She broke up with that Hugo. Next. Next! Come on. This isn't a tea-party. Carolien, I need to talk to you. I can't call you and you didn't reply to my letter. I don't want it anymore. Listen please, Carolien. Carolien! Carolien, stop. Talk to me! Get off your bike. Carolien! Look what you did, idiot! You've ruined my bike. Come here! -No! Let go of me! No! Come on. Dammit. I want to get out! Let me out! Open the door. How does it work? Listen to me! -No, let me go! Why don't you bloody listen? You can't act as if nothing happened. I've waited all morning at that school. It was driving me crazy. I've been yelling at everybody lately. I don't want that. We're returning to Zambia sooner. It's terrible, but Rita says it's better for the baby. So we don't have much time left. We can't just split up like this. We can agree on something, can't we? We can write to each other. I'll make sure I'll be back with you as soon as possible. I don't mind if I have to travel half the world. You don't need to. I'm no longer in love with you. How can you say that? We belong together. Didn't we have a good time together? The idea of being there without you. What do I have there? I wonder when Klaasje will have outgrown it. If you put two matresses together, you can sleep in a square. Yes, you wouldn't have a head side. And no feet side. You can go in any direction. He ruined my bike. So I threw it into the water. Who did you throw into the water? Your boyfriend? I wish I'd done that. The asshole. Boyfriends are difficult. -Especially when they're a lot older. Has he left school yet? He's 41. Did you come out of bed, Klaasje? -Yes. What are you doing here? -Read to me. Do you want me to read this book to you? -Yes. The Treasure and the Caterpillar. This one looks good. What's it about? About the kites. -The kites. That must be a good book. Will you sit next to me? Let's see what this is. -What? This is the beginning. People who baked their own bread and children who made their own kites. See how beautiful? -Yes. Hey, our kites, the children yelled out. Let's all let our kites fly away, Peter said. Like the bird's feathers and the colors of the rainbow. And they let their kites fly. Higher and higher. And once there was a girl who tried to grab the tail. And she missed. Look, what could have happened? We're coming, Klaasje, Mummy. -Oh, little boy. It's alright. Where's Carolien? -She flew off. She flew off? Have a look outside. Don't cry, Klaasje. Carolien! Carolien. Boots off. Lie down for a bit. Here's a blanket. It's our turn, Mouse. -Good. I need the beauty case in the plane. -As hand luggage. I don't understand where they are. They'll be here. Don't worry. There they are. I'm coming. An emergency. Not too bad. I'm glad you're still here. Where's Carolien? -We were wondering the same thing. We haven't seen her all day. Anne, don't you have any idea where she is? No, maybe she has a boyfriend. I hope that's it. There she is. Thank God. So where was she? -Later, Peter. I'm glad you came. I didn't want to at first. I’ll be thinking about you a lot. -And me about you. Hugo, you have to go. Good luck. -Bye, Rita. Thanks. -Bye, Carolien. Good luck with your baby. -Thank you. Have a good trip. -Bye. Rita, we really have to go now. Bye! -Bye! Goodbye! -Have a good trip. Goodbye. That daughter of yours will never grow up. Here, hold this. Bye!
