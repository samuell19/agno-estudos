[music playing] I have arrived at the old Hoffstedt residence, long rumored to house poltergeists, ghosts, and demons. The house has fallen into disrepair and is scheduled for destruction. Today, I, Carrie Malone, will attempt to prove or disprove that the house may or may not be, or-- well, I-- I'm just going to see if it's haunted or not. RICKY: Hey, Chris. Hi, Ricky. What have you been doing? I've been checking out the festival. How is it? Great, I just got back, and I dropped off all the stuff I won. I won three goldfish, a giant foam finger, four posters, and a purple teddy bear. A purple teddy bear? Chris, why don't you guys watch where you're going? Maybe you should watch where we're going. This is the perfect place to test my newest invention. Ah, perfect. I'm not afraid right now. If I was afraid, that would mean I'm not a real ghost hunter. And I am a real ghost, so I'm not afraid. I'm so afraid right now. [unhappy meowing] This is it, contact. [cat growling] [crashing] So you said you needed my help? Yes, I do. I'm game. What can I do? This sensor uses laser beams to count thermal entities. It will tell us precisely how many people are in a given area in mere seconds. Cool. I need you to place the sensor for me. No problem, where does it go? Up there. Up there? And what makes you think I'm the guy to do this? You're the brave one. Yes, well, that's true. CARRIE: Natalie. Oh, hey, Carrie. I just ran into your brother. Are you OK? Physically, yes, emotionally-- Hey, Jesse. I, uh-- - Hey, Carrie. - Hey, Alex. What's up? Just hanging out at the festival, it's pretty cool this year. What are you guys doing? Looking for my brother. Have you seen him? Your Your brother, yeah, where is that cutie pie? Ew, that's my brother you're talking about. Yeah, that's Carrie's brother, and I won't stand for you talking about him like that. OK, ease up. So he's not a cutie pie. So, Jesse, have you seen him? Carrie, I, uh-- Flipping Christmas, what the heck is he doing? He couldn't get electrocuted, could he? I mean, not that I care. Electrocuted? No, probably not. Probably? Got it. Nice move. That was sweet. Oh, well. So, Mr. Practer, what made you decide to throw this festival? This is my gift to the people of Brandel, to show them that Practer Industries is their friend. Let's go ahead. See if it works. [beep] [electric buzzing] I'm sure it's nothing, nothing to worry about. That wasn't quite the success I hoped for. So, Mr. Practer, what made you decide to choose Brandel as the site of your next project? Well, Brandel is the perfect fit for Practer Industries. I couldn't think of a better place to build our new golf course and country club. We've heard rumors that Practer Industries actually pressured some of the local business owners into selling their shops just to make room for the resort. That's ridiculous. The shop owners on Bay Street were only too happy to sell their old, worn-out buildings, at a very generous price, to make way for a new and modern country club. Boy, I sure do love ice cream. I know you do, Gus. Now, missy, did I ever tell you about the time that I met the queen? She came here in 1941, came right here to this town, and I met her. Yeah, Gus, you mentioned it once or twice. She shook my hand, you know? And I wish you could have seen the rings and the bracelets she had on that hand, jewelry like I've never seen before or since. Ah, Ms. Malone, so nice to see you again. I told you, I'm not selling my shop. So you'll have to build your golf course around me, because I'm not selling. This is my father's shop, and I won't ever give it up. A simple hello would have sufficed. Allow me to introduce Mr. Weeks, from the IRS. Mr. Weeks, this is Karen Malone and her son, Calvin. How do you do? I don't know who the old man is. Name's Gus. Would you mind telling me what you're doing here when I asked you to leave? Well, it seems that your father miscalculated his taxes back in 1964. He underpaid by, uh, $100. A simple mistake, really, he simply forgot to carry the one. Fine, I'll pay the $100, no big deal. Actually, with late fees, fines, penalties, and interest, the total now due is closer to $300,000. What? What, are you crazy? We don't have that kind of money. I'm sorry to say that if you do not pay this amount within three weeks, United States government will take possession of your deed and transfer it to the bank. And then the bank will put it up for auction, and I'll get it for a song. Hmm, you know, I-- I seem to recall offering you $70,000 for your shop. And now I'm going to get it for a lot less. Now I call that quite a deal. Toodles. Weeks. What are we gonna do? I mean, I can't lose this place, Cal. I grew up here. It's all right, Mom. We'll figure something out. Hey, you know what always makes me feel better? I think about the time I met the queen. Well, at least I'm not the only failure of the day. Jesse's experiment was less than fruitful as well. I swear, if I had a dime for every time he almost killed us, I'd be rich. What's with him, anyways? Every time I talk to him, he gets all stuttery and won't say anything back. Well, I guess that you can sum it all up to one simple fact. Boys are doofuses. [startled cry] Jesse, what are you doing here? You scared me half to death. I'm hiding out. After the fiasco in town today, I suspect the police will be looking for me. - What was that yelling? Oh, I just, uh-- KAREN: Kids, dinner. Dinner? Can I have some? I'm sure there's enough for one more. But I have to hide out. It's fried chicken. I see your point. So I have some bad news. What? Well, it seems we owe the IRS some money, about $300,000. What's that mean? It means we're gonna lose the shop, monkey boy. How can they do that? They just can. What will we do without the shop? Well, I still have that job offer at Mr. Travis's company. But we'd have to move to Tyler. Where is that? It's out near Hunter. But I don't want you guys to worry. I'm gonna go into the city and meet with some business people. And they might be able to lend us some money, help us get out of debt, and even do some renovations. So everything's OK? It's fine, sweetie. I'm just going to be out of town for a couple of weeks. No problem, Mom. We'll take care of things around here. No. I talked to your grandma today, and she'd love to have the two of you stay with her. Grandma? Vacation is supposed to be fun. How can we have fun when we have to stay at Grandma's? Carrie, it's just outside of town. Exactly, outside of town, Natalie lives in town. So does Jesse. That's true. Wait a minute. You said two. What about Calvin? I'm saying here. What? How is that fair? He's older, and he can take care of himself. Plus, I need him here to keep an eye on the shop while I'm gone. But Grandma's is only outside of town. Carrie, don't start. [doorbell ringing] I'll get it. Oh, my gosh, I just called this guy, you know, Josh. And he said that he might want to go out with me on Friday night and maybe go to the movies. Why are you still dressed like that? Well, the band was supposed to be here today, but it's not. And they had this festival thing, so they canceled it. Come on. Let's go to my room. [classical music] This is dorky. Nobody dances like this. Shh, you'll get it. I could greatly increase the probability of ensnaring a fish. That rod uses only one lure. It just doesn't make sense mathematically. That's the whole point. [girls giggling] What in the name of Jupiter are they doing? Who knows? Girls are stupid. Computers, they make sense, girls, not so much. What's wrong? You look like there's something on your mind? Don't worry about it. No, what is it? Well-- I was just thinking about how my mom might lose the shop. What about it, that you might have to move? What? You can't move. Who will be around to French braid my hair? Oh, thanks, Nats. I'm glad you're seeing the big picture here. You You know what I mean. It just, well, it wouldn't be any fun around here without you. I just wish-- I wish there was something I could do, to help out, you know. But how could I raise $300,000? That would be a lot of lemonade to still. Besides, my mom says that it will be all right. Well, then, what's to worry about? Let's do makeovers. Wouldn't you rather take my telescope out and check for UFOs? What? You're serious? There has to be something I can do. There just has to be. I can't think of anything. Perhaps I need some brain fuel. Let's eat. We just ate. 22 minutes ago. KAREN: Kids. What is it, Mom? Well, I thought about what you said about being away from your friends for vacation. So I called your grandma, and she said each of you can bring a friend with you if you'd like. Sweet, it'll be like camp. [phone ringing] Hello. Mr. Practer? Yes, Weeks, what is it? It's about the woman with the shop that won't sell. What of her? She's planning to set up a meeting with his boss to put some money into her shop. Really? Well, I have to give her credit. She's a fighter. Thank you, Weeks. This might just get interesting, after all. Yes, goodnight. So, Ms. Malone, you think you can defeat me, John Practer. Not very likely. [music playing] (SINGING) If you're jumping back into your past, looking for something you know will really last, and you find it every time, when you go back in time, oh, the treasure, back in time. Sometimes, the answers seem to run and hide. Sometimes, you wonder if time is on your side. Hey, Mom. Oh, my baby girl. Good to see you, Lenny. It's Grandma to you, darling. My goodness, I think you've grown a foot since I saw you the last time. Hi, Christopher. How are you, darling? Good, Grandma. You and your friend are going to share the room at the top of the stairs. Just go ahead and put your things in there. Carrie, how are you, pumpkin? Fine. You're going to stay in the room across from the boys, so go ahead and put your bag there. OK, thanks, Grandma. - Well. - I'm Jesse. Hi. I'm Grandma Lenny. Lenny? It's short for Lenora. Very nice, where should I put this? Up the stairs, you'll see Chris up there. - Hello. - I'm Natalie. Jeez, Natalie, think you brought enough junk? A woman can never have enough luggage, right, Natalie? Right. I've got all my beauty supplies to think about. I haven't been online all day. No DSL? No cable modem? I'm in Hades. This must be Hades. So off to the city. Yeah, I hate to leave the kids for so long. I mean, they're growing so fast, and I don't want to miss it. But I can't give up the shop without a fight. LENNY: Is it really as bad as that? It's worse. I don't know what I'm gonna do, Mom. I think I'm gonna lose Dad's shop. I mean, John Practer, he's not giving me any choice. He's got the bank on his side. LENNY: I wish I could loan you the money. I'm sorry, honey. I just don't have it. I'd give it to you if I did. I know you would, Mom. Carrie, I have to tell you something. I tell the kids everything is fine, but it's not. I mean, we may have to move, and I said that we wouldn't. They just looked so upset. Maybe it wasn't the right thing to do. If it makes a child happy, it's always right. Well, hopefully my meetings in the city will get us the money that we need. Who are the meetings with? Well, I've got a couple. The first one is with a guy who runs a shipping company. His name is Kyle Dooshel. Yes, this is John Practer. I'm calling from Mr. Kyle Dooshel. Mr. Dooshel, yes, um, I understand you have a meeting with a woman, uh, name of Karen Malone? Sweet. KAREN: Chris, honey, come say goodbye. I've got to go. You be good, OK? I'll call every day. Good, I'll miss you. I love you, honey. I love you, too. See you doofuses around. We need to have a meeting. Natalie heard something. Well, what is it? What did you hear? You know how your mom said you don't have to worry about losing the shop? Well, I just heard her telling your grandma she was pretty sure she would lose it. It sounded like that Practer guy was gonna take it from her. I don't know about you guys, but I am not giving in. Right, we have to stop him. I want to, but how? We'll think of something. I've seen enough spy movies to know how to take an evil developer down. We search his banking records. These guys are never on the up and up. And how do we do that? Listen. I'm, like, two years shy of being a full-fledged, beautiful, and mysterious international spy. Well, are we in it together? We're with you, Chris. You can set those in here. What's that stuff for? That's for me to know and you to find out. What are you reading? It's a book about the Brandel Banshee. Oh, boy, not this again. What? What's that? You've never heard of the Brandel Banshee? It's world famous, to ghost buffs, anyway. Well, what is it? It's not an it. It's a she. Why don't you tell him, Grandma? You tell it best. Yeah, is it true? Is there really a ghost? Of course, it's true. She lives-- I mean, she lived-- out in a little cabin out in my back woods. The cabin out back? I saw it today. Tell him, Grandma. Tell him all about it. All right, then, I'll tell you about the Brandel Banshee. Her name was Carolyn. She was a beautiful woman. In fact, her beauty was famous all over the state. She lived in the cabin out in the back woods, with a daughter just about your age. Now they were very poor, but happy just to have each other's love. They didn't need anything, but Carolyn wanted to give her daughter a gift for her 12th birthday. Carolyn worked in a hospital. She didn't make much money, but she loved helping people. One night, when she was checking a patient, she was thinking about how she couldn't afford to buy a gift for her little girl. She began to cry. The patient saw how she cried, and his heart broke. Anyway, he offered Carolyn a very expensive gold bracelet for her to give to her daughter. And it was adorned with sapphires and rubies and was said to be the most exquisite piece. [thunder] Carolyn couldn't wait to see the smile on her little girl's face when she received the bracelet on her birthday. Unfortunately, she never would. A storm came on fast. It started much like a typical rainstorm but became much, much worse. All Carolyn could think of was getting home to her little girl. Unfortunately, she didn't make it. [thunderbolt] Nobody ever saw that bracelet again. So Carolyn haunts the Brandel woods, forever searching for that bracelet, to give it to her beloved daughter. What happened to the girl? She grew up, as all little girls do. Well, I think it's time for dinner. You know what? We should try to catch Carolyn. The Brandel Banshee, are you nuts? Yeah, what do you think, Jesse? Could you make something that could catch the ghost? There's no such thing as ghosts. Some scientists think ghosts exist. And if someone passes away suddenly, where does all that energy go? See, Chris? Even scientists believe in ghosts. If it's true, I can make a device that detects electromagnetic fields. That would enable us to track it. Really? Could we catch it? I suppose it's possible. Let's do it. Let's do it. Do you think it's a good idea? You can't catch something that doesn't exist. We could give it a shot. It would be interesting. LENNY: Kids, dinner's ready. Here you go, darling. And here's yours, Jesse. Now remember. Nobody leaves here until your plate is clean. I love you. Well, dig in. So I found an old fort out back in the woods, out by that cabin. Yes, sweetie, your grandfather built that for your mom when she was a little girl. I'm afraid it's falling apart, though, through the years. You know, I bet we could fix it up, make a really cool fort. Are you gonna finish that? I think we're a bit too old for forts, don't you? Nonsense, I still make forts myself. I think it's a great idea for you to fix it up. What do you think, Carrie? I'm in, sounds like fun. It would be a great place to base our ghost-hunting operation out of. It would be good for the other thing. CHRIS: Jesse. Huh, what? Do you want to rebuild the fort? Sure, fine, whatever. What about you, Nats? You in? OK, so long as I don't get dirty. Seconds? What are you thinking about? Mom, the shop, moving, I don't know, lots of stuff. Yeah, I know. Do you remember when we went to California for vacation? The whole time we were there, all I could think about was coming home. Yeah, I remember. You cried the whole time. Well, if we have to move, maybe our lives will be a lot like that. Carolyn, Carolyn, are you there? I know all about you and what happened. I know that you're haunting the woods in search of the bracelet that you never gave your daughter. See? I know all about you. Just give me a sign, any sign, that you're out there. Please. Note, the first attempt to catch Carolyn has produced a negative result, zip, nada, a big, fat zero. Well, at least we can still build the fort. Well, there she is. We've got our work cut out for us. Hi. My name is Karen Malone. I'm here to see Mr. Dooshel. One moment, please. Mr. Dooshel, there is a Karen Malone here to see you, sir. Yes, sir, very good. Mr. Dooshel is too busy to see you. What? We had an appointment. Yes, he offers his apologies, but his schedule is simply too full right now. Fine, how about later? Perhaps it would be best if you called back later this week. PRACTER: He just told her he couldn't take the meeting. That's great. And now we have to find out who else she's meeting with. And how are we gonna do that? I know. She left her kids in charge of the shop, right? And don't all moms leave their kids a list of where they're gonna be? We just go over to the shop and get that list. Weeks, do not give me that illegal mumbo jumbo. If you want that job with my firm, you'll do what I say, when I say it. I've got her. [music playing] Yes. We did it. She's something. It needs something. Paint, it needs to be painted. Painted? Let me do that. LENNY: I brought you some iced tea. [clattering] Natalie, what are you doing? You're not qualified to handle this level of technology. You're not the only one who has a way with computers. Computer, find a telephone number for Practer, John. Hey, Carrie, come here. Look. JESSE: Chris, come here. You should see this. She's about to hack into Practer's computer. How do you know all this stuff? A good spy never tells. NATALIE: Computer, find password. [wind blowing] It's Carolyn. It's the Brandel Banshee. It's the ghost. Do you really think? Come on. CARRIE: We have to go back. NATALIE: No way, are you nuts? I'm never going back there. That ghost is real. It's probably all gross and ugly and slimy. Hey, Jess, you OK? CARRIE: What's wrong, Chris? I thought you didn't believe in ghosts. Scared? No, I'm not, butt dart. Butt dart? What the heck is a butt dart? You are. Anyway, there's no such thing as ghosts. You're all being silly. It's just, well, something was making that noise. It could have been a bear or a lion or something. A lion? That was no animal. It was a ghost. And I heard it. It was a ghost, which is why we have to go back and document it, for science. Right, Jesse? Jesse thinks so. Look. I say we're not going back there. It's not safe. So how's the fort? Did something happen out there today? Come on, guys. Let's-- let's have it. We found the ghost, or we heard it, anyways. Really? Yeah, but everyone's afraid to go back, except me. Is that true, Christopher? Yeah, well, kinda. There's no such thing as ghosts, but there's something out there, something scary. Something, huh, but you don't know what? Well, if you don't know what it is, how can you be scared of it? It seems to me you're just scared because you don't understand it. That's not right, is it? Well, if you need anything else, I'll be in the other room. Is your ghost gear ready? Well, I-- I-- could you tell her I just need to test the equipment. Well, let's go. Carolyn, look. I didn't bring my recorder because I thought it might have scared you. I just want to be friends. Jesse's making this really cool invention called the Ghost Catcher 5,000. And I'm sure it's going to work because he's really good at that kind of thing. Oh, maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that. Well, I just want to ask you a couple of questions, like will you ever stop haunting the woods? And whatever happened to your little girl? [wind blowing] Carolyn? [distant sawing] [hammering] [scraping] I give you the Ghost Tracker 2,000. It's gorgeous. It's brilliant. It's a toy. How dare you? It's one of a kind, a prototype. Watch. As it detects energy, the lights blink quicker, and the beeping speeds up. That way we can tell where the ghost is. Cool. So we can find it with this thingy. Then what? Then we use the Ghost Catcher 5,000. Where is it? Right here. The deer? Yes. You couldn't have come up with something a little more less stupid? This deer is made from the perfect substance to trap energy. I'm sorry if it's not cool. How does it work? You hold on to these handles, point the deer at the ghost, and then pull the trigger. The attraction ray will come out of the black orb on the deer's chest, sucking up the energy, trapping the ghost. Do it. Show us. No way. Why not? This baby is powered by a highly potent combination of electrical and fossil fuel. No way I'm trying it first. I'll do it, like it will even work. Wait. We have to take precautions. OK, we're set. Depress the activating mechanism. Huh? Pull the trigger. [whirring] Cool. Wow. It worked. [device powering down] Chris. I knew it. She's overheating. I have to find some sort of cooling system. I'm going to have to go into town to secure the parts that I need to fix the Ghost Catcher 5,000. This is the perfect opportunity to test my newest invention. This will get me there rather quickly. I want to go, too. Maybe you better not. What's this button do? Don't touch that. I can't feel my feet. Hey, look what you did. That was awesome. I would have to say, you are correct. I did it. I spoke to her, yes. Have you found anything yet? Practer's software encryption system is tougher than I thought. I might have found a way around it, though. Computer, access mainframe. Well, I guess we head back to Grandma's. - What? - Come on. It's only a few miles. Now, Calvin, did I tell you about the time I met the queen? You may have mentioned it. I shook her hand. You should have seen the jewelry she had on that hand. What's happening? Hold on. [beeping] Darn. He's got a firewall set up. I can't read his files, not even with the best decrypting software. Unless-- - Unless what? Isn't that that Practer guy who's trying to take my mom's shop? You're not welcome here. I had a feeling. I just thought I'd drop by and take a look at my future property. You'll never get your dirty hands on this shop. It belongs in our family, the way it always has. Now you have to leave. Ooh, and exactly what are you going to do about it? Gus, want to give me a hand? Happy to. Now-- now hang on a second. Let's-- OK, OK, OK. You don't have to be rude. I can take a hint. It slipped. [phone ringing] Malones, Calvin speaking. Hey, what's up, hamster breath? What? Have you gone crazy? No, I won't do that. What are you, crazy or something? I thought you weren't coming. I'm just here to keep you out of trouble. Well, keep an eye out then. Are you in yet? I'm in. NATALIE (ON RADIO): Good, go to the computer. You know, Nats, did it ever occur to you that you could have just come here with me? It would have taken too long to search his files. I have to be here to transfer the data into my hard drive. Then we can go through his banking files with a fine-toothed comb. I just hope you weren't too scared. NATALIE (ON RADIO): Yeah, right, hog pimple. Now turn on his computer. It's on. NATALIE (ON RADIO): OK, now listen to my instructions very carefully. OK, it's ready. Computer, begin transfer. Natalie, I've got to go. Go NATALIE: We need another 30 seconds. Don't cut off transmission yet. Almost there. Hey, Practer, you're a giant tub of pigeon poop. PRACTER: I am going to teach you lousy kids a lesson. You just wait and see. I think it's ready. Yeah, I'm sure it works now. OK, that's it then. We go tonight. Tonight? According to the literature, the Brandel Banshi comes out almost exclusively at night, around midnight. What about Grandma Lenny? She won't let us out that late. I guess we sneak out. We can set up camp in the fort. Sneak out? What if she checks on us? Oh, we can take care of that. After creating a foolproof plan for sneaking out, we've decided we're going to test the Ghost Catcher 5,000 this very night. Finally, we're going to get to meet Carolyn, up close and personal. Note to self, remember to bring flashlights. Oh, another note to self, we do not need to be detected. Wear black. If Grandma catches us, we're sunk. [wind blowing] Carolyn? Yes, tonight, we're going tonight. I'm not scared. I'm a ghost hunter. Well, we're off to bed. Already? It's early. Well, you know, early to bed, early to rise, and stuff. Well, OK, you should call your mother first, though. [phone ringing] Hello. Mom, how are you? Oh, Carrie, hi, honey. How are you doing? Good, I'm glad to hear it. Me? I'm fine. Things are going great. Listen, hon. I-- I gotta-- I need to go. But, um, tell your brother that I-- I love him, OK? I love you. I love you, too. Bye-bye. Be good. She had to go. She says she loves you. [loud rock music] NATALIE: Well, isn't this just perfect? I had one request, not to get dirty. Now look. This will never come out. [wind blowing] She's here. Can you believe it? I can't believe it. You heard it, right? A ghost, oh, man. I'm a bit frightened, actually. Come on. We've got to go try out this ghosting gear. I'm not sure we should. Chris? I don't know what to think. How about it, Nats? What do you say? I'm tired. I'm cold. I'm filthy, and I like it. Let's go get that ghost. I think she's here. Must be. This was her home, right? I'm going in. Me, too. I'll go with you. No, you guys stay here, in case something happens. Somebody might have to go for help. Yeah, yeah, I like that idea. I love that idea. Wish us luck. Good luck. Oh, the little darlings. It's been too long. I'm going in. [glass breaking] What happened? I saw something. I know I did. But I got scared and threw the ghost tracker at it. Where's Carrie? She saw it, too, but she ran after it. You two go get Grandma. I'm going after my sister. I'm going to get you. JESSE: Lenny. Grandma Lenny. Kids, why aren't you upstairs in bed? We've got to tell you something. Carrie. Carrie. This is where we saw it. Oh, this is Carolyn's house. We know. It got Carrie. Oh, now don't worry, honey. I'm sure she's fine. Come on. Let's go find her and Chris. Come on. Is something there? What-- who's there? Carolyn? Carolyn? I can't believe it. Carrie, Carrie, I'm so glad you're all right. Look what I found. It's Carolyn's. She wants to give it to her daughter. Oh, Carrie, thank heavens you're OK. I think I have something for you. It's beautiful, Mom. It's beautiful. What a night, huh? So how did you know Grandma Lenny was Carolyn's daughter? I don't know. I just did. I just wanted to thank you for finding my bracelet. She's at peace now, Grandma. I know, sweetie. Now, Carrie, my mother wanted me to have this bracelet. But now I want to give it to you. Oh, thank you, Grandma. You're welcome, baby. Anyone home? Mom. Hi, guys. Oh, I missed you guys so much. CHRIS: We missed you, too, Mom. So there's no way to save the shop? I'm sorry, honey. Got It's just too much money. The three weeks are up tomorrow, and they're going to take the place away. Hey, we can sell the bracelet. I'm sorry, baby, but even that bracelet is not worth enough money. Well, duh, it's the bracelet of the Brandel Banshee. Ghost buffs will pay tons for this kind of stuff. We could have an online auction. It's the best way to sell junk. Don't you get it, Mom? It's like Carolyn is sending us the bracelet to help us out. You know, she sent the bracelet for us to find and save the shop. It's got to work. I know it. Well, we can give it a try, sweetie. But don't get your hopes up too high. Come on. Let's set the auction up. I know you're here. I can feel it. You are here, aren't you? I was so worried when Mom came home and said she couldn't save the shop. Then I realized you sent me to the bracelet to try to help us. You don't mind if we sell it, do you? All right, Carrie, we need a picture. What do we want our lowest accepted price to be? What's that? We can choose a price that the bidders have to meet before we agree to sell the merchandise. Otherwise, someone might get it for very little money. $300,000. OK, one extremely rare piece of supernatural memorabilia is now on sale. $1,000. $2,000. $2,500. It's going to work. Still $3,000, it's been like this for hours. I guess that's it. Mom. Mom. Mama, wake up. Is she going to be OK? I think so. It looks like she just fainted. We'll know more when we get to the hospital. Hey, she's going to be fine, OK? I'm going to drop you guys off at home. Calvin's there. And then I'm going to go to the hospital with Grandma. Can't we go, too? Maybe later, OK? I want to find out what's going on first. Come on. That was Mom. She said Grandma is going to be fine. They just want to keep her there for some tests. Thank God. Mom's going to say. What's wrong, Carrie? She's going to be fine. The shop, the bank is still taking it away tomorrow. Can you believe this place won't be ours in a couple of hours? I just wish Mom could've been here one last time. Maybe it's best this way. She might not want to let it go. Is that the bracelet? Yeah. Well, I'll be. What is it? That bracelet, it belonged to the queen. Sure, Gus. It did. Didn't I tell you about the time I met the queen? I shook her hand. I'll never forget it. That's her bracelet. I bet that thing is worth a fortune. Here it is. "One of the queen's jewelry boxes was stolen while she was traveling in the US. It's believed that the pieces of jewelry in the box have been split up and sold off by unknowing vendors. It's estimated that each piece is worth $300,000." If we could find somebody to buy it, we could save the shop. I'll buy it. Could we sell it online? The IRS will give the shop back to the bank in 24 minutes. We don't have that long. Hey, I'll buy it. Right, Gus. I'm serious, and I have the money to pay for it. - Really? - Yeah, at my home across town. Let's go get it. Well, uh, the bush comes in 40 minutes. The bus? Well, I don't have a car. We don't have that long. Hey, we could use the van out back. Calvin, you could drive it. Well, OK. OK, mirrors in place. Come on. Come on. All right. Hurry it up. Put the car in gear. Merciful Zeus, just let Gus drive. Well, Weeks, in 20 minutes I'll be able to buy that silly, little shop. I've got the check right here. Well, let's go inside, shall we? I'm sure the bank manager is expecting us, since he didn't tell anyone else about the sale. Are you sure you're feeling OK, Mom? I'm fine, honey. I'm really fine. Where is everybody? I'm gonna go check out back. Well, just a few more minutes, and we'll be able to complete the transaction for you. Good. - That'll be just fine. Mom, I can't find them, and the van's gone. I think we should go look for them. Oh, boy. Move it, Gus. [kids shouting] CHRIS: Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. That's a very sharp suit you've got on today. Why, thank you. CARRIE: Can you believe this? It's Mom, and she's mad. 20 seconds left. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6-- CARRIE: We got the money. What? Impossible. We've got it. In cash. Look. I guess you get to keep your shop. But-- but this isn't right. My resort, what am I gonna do? Mr. John Practer, I'm Agent Smith, IRS. I'm here to place you under arrest. What? This is outrageous. We were tipped off by an agent Natalie Pierce. It seems you've been evading your taxes for the past 12 years. Chris and I did a little reconnaissance work. It seems Mr. Practer has been cheating on his taxes for quite some time. I can't believe this. Believe it, buddy. You're going away. And, Weeks, I'll deal with you later. You're in big trouble, young lady. We saved the shop. What? We got the money. We did it. I can't believe we got to the bank on time. I know. And did you see the look on Practer's face? I want to give this to you. Oh, Gus, thank you. Carrie, I want to give it to you. Thank you, Grandma. You're welcome, honey. Thank you, Great-Grandma. Carolyn, this is probably the last time I'm ever going to talk to you, so I have a few things to say. First, I'm sorry I ever doubted you. When the bracelet wouldn't sell at the auction, I thought you had abandoned us. I was just scared we were gonna lose the shop. But in the end, you had a plan for everything. Thank you, Great-Grandma. Thank you. This is Carrie Malone, proven ghost hunter for the case of the Brandel Banshee. Until next time. [music playing] (SINGING) It seems like everything's so hard. It seems like everybody is out to get me, sometimes. I try to play the right cards. Somebody's always got a better hand than mine. But I know that I am somebody special. And I know somebody's looking out for me. And I know that I shouldn't see the glass half empty, 'cause I know somebody's got it worse than me. It'll all work out. Things are never quite as bad as they are in your mind. You may not know how. Just believe that everything will be just fine, maybe not right now. You never know what tomorrow brings. It'll all work out. I don't know much, but I know one thing. It'll all work out. It seems like nobody knows what it's like to go through the trouble I've seen. But I realize everybody else feels the way I do when I can't seem to catch my dream.
