- Looks like it's about to rain. - Yep. - Oh my God, you see that? - What? - That. - What is it? - Looks like a llama. - I bet it's the Wilson's. It must've got out of the fence again. - Well you better go give them a call. - Let's do it in the morning. Weather is getting ready to come in and I don't feel like chasing a llama around in the rain all night. - Alright, let's hurry. Did you call the neighbors about the llama? - No, I did not. - Probably should because it's storming. - Well it's not my problem. If it was my llama I'd be concerned. - You won't think that when he gets in the garden you just put out. - Then it'll be a dead llama. - My God! Alright, just bag 'em and get 'em back to base. - I can't believe Dad didn't show. - Why would he show? It wasn't his parents' funeral. - Yeah, but, he should've been there. What was he doing? - That's enough talk about your father. - Sorry, Mom. - You're gonna have to stay at your grandparents' house until we get this whole will situated. - Did the police have any news on the killer? - It wasn't a killer, it was some escaped zoo animal. - No, it couldn't have been the animal. I don't know how they could've got inside the house. - Oh my God, Floyd. It was the Loch Ness and Chewbacabra, Sasquatch, Moth Man. - That's enough. It was a freak accident, what happened to your grandparents. The house is a safe place. Don't worry, the warden's gonna be patrolling and he's gonna continue patrolling even after the house is sold. - What are you doing? - I'm not gonna stay in this depressing dress all day. - Now you better take care of your grandparents' house. Don't be treating it like some college frat house. I know what goes on there, I'm not stupid, I've been to college. - Mom, I'm not stupid either. - Since when did Memaw and Papa get a llama? - Who cares, Floyd. - You know your grandparents. They'll buy anything that they don't need. Now come one, help me with these bags. God, Floyd, shut the door. - Now you need to be nice to your brother. He's been through a lot. - My God, Mom, he's not a little kid anymore. He needs to grow up. - It doesn't matter. He's not like you. He was young when your father and I split up. That does something to a kid. - Oh my God. - I mean it, Mel. - Fine, I'll be nice, whatever. - And if he wets the bed, don't make a big deal out of it. - But Mom, you said you wouldn't tell anyone. - Oh, honey, I'm sorry. It's just that your sister cares about you. One time I had to go to school and bring her a pair of underwear. - I was little though. - It's still not the same. - I think we got the last bag out of the car so you can probably head out now. - Okay, Mel, promise me you'll behave. - Yes, I promise I'll be good. - Floyd, take care of your sister. - Okay, I'll try. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, Mom. - How long do you think we have to be here for? - Who cares, we have a house to ourselves. - Who are you calling? - I'm calling Stacy so she can get her ass over here with some beer. Hey Stacy, yeah, guess what? Yep, all to myself. So go ahead and text everyone and I'm gonna do the same. Alright, I'll let you know the address in a little bit. Alright, later bitch. - You can't call everyone, Mom said. - Oh my God, Floyd, calm down. It's gonna be fine. We're gonna have a couple people over tonight and you're just gonna have to deal with it. It's gonna be fine. You might even enjoy yourself. - Fine. But if anything happens, if it gets crazy in there, or if anything happens, I'm gonna make everyone leave and I'm gonna call Mom. - You can't live up Mom's ass forever. - I said fine. - I'm calling Mark. Hey, what's up? - Who the fuck is Mark? - Hey Dan, it's Mel. Hey Sheila. Hey Tre. Sebastian. Amanda. Barney, you want to come to a party tonight? Mike, hey. Kathleen, what's up? Miguel, Hola! I wanted to know if you want to swing by. Hi Kim. Hi Ernie, how are ya. Hey Julie. Hey Spock. You and Sally should totally come to my party tonight. Hey Cody. Hey Mary. Stop calling me. Hey Alex. You want to come over, we're having kind of a party. Hey Ted. Hey Emily. Hold on, Rob's on the other line. Rob, where's my fucking money? Hey Annie, are you free? Who cares if your Dad died, come to my party. Hey Sara. Hey Zeus. Hey Cassie. Hey Harry. Tessa, oh you're with Cassie? Oh, well just have her fill you in. You have any nice lady friends that you could bring with you? That would be awesome. Hold on. Oh my God, Floyd, change your clothes. You look like a loser. - Fine. - I need your thoughts on this, doctor. - Well, by the look of things, I think I'm getting too old for this shit. - The report from NASA says they were tracking this and they believe it come from the Orion Nebula. - Well it makes sense because it's a, it came through the northern quadrant and crash landed here so I think it's a pretty good assumption. - I have never seen technology this advanced. - Me either. We can study this technology for a lifetime and not even understand a tenth of its advanced capabilities. - But doctor, there's something else I wanted to show you. - I've been waiting my whole life for something like this. Let's take it and examine it. Never have I ever slept with a professor. - Scholars are bad bitches. - Oh, bitch cup! - Bitch cup! - Drop your drawers. - There's no way those are the house rules. - House rules! - Yeah! - Drop your drawers, drop your drawers. - Drop your drawers. - Drop your drawers, drop your drawers. - Nice. - Hey guys, can we use coasters? Grandpa's trying to sell the house, well, my Mom's trying to sell the house. I just don't want to get anything here ruined. - Okay. - Thatâ€™s all I'm trying to say. - I'm gonna grab another beer. - I'm sorry. - Anybody, anybody want anything? - Excuse me. Yeah, and grab some more coasters. - Hey dude, I'm serious. The sequel, way better than the original. - No fucking way. - By a long shot. - Not even a little bit, man. - Come on! - The original Evil Dead, no man, you can't beat that. - Dude, Army of Darkness is my shit. - Okay, Dan, Dan, what's your opinion? - About what. - Which one's better, Evil Dead one or two? - I love the new one. - That's bullshit. - Without Bruce Campbell, is this dude serious? - Of course not, dude, all hail the king! - All hail the king! - All hail the king! - Shoot it, babe. Nice. - Oh, drop your drawers! - Oh, drop your drawers! - You know you want to. Show 'em what you're working with. - Just can't believe that Pluto's not a planet anymore. - Sorry, I hear that Uranus is pretty bare though. - Yo, we need to talk. Oh God. Fuck. Stop, I got it, I got it. - Oh my God, what's wrong? - What the fuck is wrong with your brother? - Dan, I told you, he's a train wreck. - Yeah, I know, but that's a pretty bad showing right now. How are we doing on operation getting him laid? - Yeah, I'm working on it, but that isn't helping. - Well, who'd you get anyway? She's not a total slut, right? Because the last thing I want is for my brother to get herpes and completely be turned off to fun. - By fun, you mean sex? - Well is there any other kind? - Good point. Well, Alex is kind of a slut, but Sam, she's a cherry picker. - A cherry picker? - She likes virgins and she likes to stick around until they both get their instruments in tune. - Dan, oh my God, stop. Okay, just make it happen. I'm gonna go get another drink. - Alright, I'm gonna grab some beers. - Hey, sweet cheeks, remember the last time we both had our drawers down? - Why were you both drawers-less? - Don't worry about it, babe. It was nothing, really. Seriously. I don't even know what he's talking about. Babe! - How you do that fucking circle thing? - Oh, the two ears, it's like you put. - Hey guys, what is that smell? - I don't smell anything. What are you smelling? What are you even talking about man? - It smells like skunk. - I don't smell anything, man. - It smells kind of like Dad's lady friends. - I don't know, man. - It's you guys, you smell like it. - Maybe it's the paprika. - Yeah! - You should get it. Hey, Floyd! - Yeah? - Get Sam a drink. She don't drink beer. - Yeah, I'll go make her a drink. - This fucking kid! - Smooth, man, that was real smooth. - I'm gonna take a pull on that. - Alright, alright. - Oh, man. - Has anyone seen Sarah? - She's so funny, that's hilarious. - Bitch. - Dude, nice shot! - What do you mean, he text you a couple times? - I mean, I don't know. He's probably just checking to see how I'm doing. - How you're doing? Your ex-boyfriend is not supposed to text you, period. What are you looking at, player? - I'm sorry. - It's not like it meant anything. - Yeah? This shit needs to stop, okay? - Hey, you having fun? - No, not really. When can everybody go home? - Floyd, look around, everyone's drinking. We can't advocate drinking and driving. - Was that your whole plan all along? - Calm down, it's fine. Besides I saw you talking to that girl in there. - Yeah, she did ask me to make her a drink. - She did? Okay, hold on. Okay, here you go. Just make sure you give that to her and make sure to smile. - Thanks, like this? - Uh, yeah, that's fine, just smile. - Oh, that's nice. - What do you mean you only blew him twice? - Hey you guys, take it outside. - Whatever. - It didn't mean anything. Dave! - I have this bone that's like bent off. It has like all these drools all over it. - What is this? - Something wrong with that fucking llama. - Dude, what? - Seriously, his eyes man, you guys gotta listen to me. Fucking, it's like it was possessed or something. Guys, you gotta listen to me. - Ooh! - Oh my god! - Serious, guys. I'm fucking serious, man. Fuck! - That boy has smoked himself silly. - What you been smoking? - Guys, we gotta go, we gotta get the fuck out of here. - Yeah. - I got you a drink. - Thanks. - Welcome. - Dan, what if I play this game? - Who's house is this? - Sit down and let's have some fun. Take this. - Thank you. So how do we play? - It's really simple. You just pull a card. What does that mean? - Waterfall! - I know its eyes turned red. - I believe you bro, man, I really do. But here's the thing, it didn't happen. - Yes, it did. - Man, this shit had me believing that my dog was Lucifer and then I had to obey its every command. - Dude, really? What did he make you do? - He made me cook him steak and hot dogs. Man, when I came down my Mom saw the mess and she was pissed. - Dude, dude, Cody, you seem really tense right now. Here, I'll pack a bowl for you. - I know it wasn't that fucking weed. - This stuff will make you see dancing llamas, rather than those red-eye llamas you been looking at, bro. That's a way better trip, here. - Whoa, never seen a wildebeest before. Hey buddy, want a hit? - Babe? Where are you? Look, I'm sorry. Hey, let's go inside and talk about it. - What does nine do? - Nine rhyme. - Just say a word. - Shit. - Fit. - Bit. - Clit. - Lit. - Shit. - That's a repeat. You drink now! - Okay. - What, what happened? - That's all you. You have to chug that now. Chug, bitch. - Chug it! Hurry! Hurry! - Oh my, Jesus Hey, leave him alone. Hey, he's alright. Come on, come on. - What the fuck are we supposed to do now? Who wants to play with beer vomit cards? - There's a, We don't have to, there's a hot tub out back. You don't have to play cards. We can do something else, guys. - You have a hot tub? - Yeah, my grandparents had. - You've been holding out on me? Oh my God! - Hot tub, hot tub, hot tub, you're coming. Let's go, let's go. Rally the troops, let's go. - I'm gonna rally the troops. Hot tub! Wakey, wakey, no more bakey. - What's up, Dan? - Guess what I just found. - What? - I found a hot tub. Hot tub party. Yeah, buddy. - What about you, Cody? You in or you out? - What's it? - A hot tub party? You in or are you out? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay, alright, let's go, let's go. Okay, ready, ready. - Oh, shit, my bad, Cheech! - What's up, man? - What's up? Where's the fucking beer at in this place, man? - Oh, dude, I don't got any beer. This is a special night. - Yeah? - This is special celestial lemongrass bud. - Yeah, let me see it? Alright, later, Shaggy. I'm gonna go get fucking laid. - You wanna hang out a little? Okay, nevermind. - So Mel, tell me about your new boyfriend. - Well, his name is Trent and. - Hey dear, am I too late? - Hey, how are ya? So this is Trent. - Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, I've heard a lot about you. - Nothing bad, I hope. - Just that you like snatching kisses and vice versa. - Oh my God, Stacy, stop! - You enjoying that beer? Cause I'm enjoying watching you drink that beer. - Wait, I'm pretty tired. Think I'll take a nap now. - Mel, you did not tell me you had a hot tub. - Oh, I totally forgot. Grandpa only put it in this year. - How's it going? I'm Trent, Mel's boyfriend. - That's a pretty nice grip you've got there. - Yes, yes it is. So is yours. - Measure your dicks some other time then. - Hot tub. - What's this I hear about a hot tub? - Yeah, we're all getting in, let's go. - Let's go, fuck this kitchen. - Whoo, yeah! - The bathroom. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, it's gonna be a while. - What, are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, I doubt that, dick. - What did you say? - Uh, nothing, dude. - You're lucky I'm preoccupied right now. - Fuck that. - I've never done this before. - I know. - So uh. - Get the fuck out of here. - Trent, what the fuck? - What? Oh come on, I can't help it if some chick wants to send me a tit pic. - You did so good. - Yeah, I'm a man now. - Oh shit. Of course. - Hey, got nothing about these beers. - Oh, sorry bro. Go get some. - Be right back. - Dude, got it! - It's in the house. - God damn it, I can't wait. What? - Oh man, I don't know. They might have got in the water. - Are you ready to do this? - Let's do it. - Hey you guys, I got some beers. - You fucking suck. What is wrong with you? - We got to know each other a little bit. - Oh yeah, I'm sure you did. - We did. - I'm sure. - We really did. - What the fuck? What the fuck is wrong with you? - They're all dead. They're all dead, all of them. - Excuse me? - Everyone is dead in the hot tub. Hot tub. The hot tub. - Dan, what are you talking about? - Everyone is dead in the hot tub! - Fuck! What if that boob pic was your boobs? You know my boobs are way nicer than that. And besides, who would be texting you a picture of my boobs? Also, I saw the dick pic on your phone from months ago from that one dude. And I do know who it was. That dick pic was from months ago. Oh my God, Dan, what's going on? - Everyone is dead in the hot tub! - Oh my God, oh my God! - What the fuck is that, dude, oh my fucking God. What in the actual shit, oh my God, dude. I did not call my bath salts guy before this party. - What the fuck, Trent? - I wasn't in the hot tub! - What's this noise? - Floyd, everyone in the hot tub is dead. - Everyone is dead in the hot tub! - Take out your phone and call 911. - Not one single bar, bro. - I don't have any signal, Floyd. You don't have any service? I have no service. - Then let's go outside where there might be service. - No, there are fucking no bars, yeah of course. - You have a signal now? - No! - No! - My parents don't make eight figures for two out of six bars, Jesus. Nothing's going on. Just a regular party with regular people and there's nothing going on. - Floyd, shut up, you're drunk. - No, you shut up. Actually no you don't shut up. You just keep trying to call. - Floyd, I don't have any service out here. - Well the good news is there's nothing you need to have service for. - What are you talking about? We have a whole hot tub of dead people inside! - They're obviously not dead, they're just passed out. This is a party. - Floyd, they're dead. Ask Dan. - They're dead. Dan is obviously on something. Look at him. - We need to get a hold of the police. They're dead. - We don't need to get a hold of the police. We don't need to get a hold of anyone. Just maybe more beer. Actually, let's go inside and drink some more. - Floyd, when did you become such an asshole? Just go crawl back up Mom's ass, okay? - Turn around. - What the fuck? - Fuck! - Oh god! - Wait, didn't grandpa and grandma have a land line? - Yeah, yeah, they did. - Hello, yes, yes, this is an emergency. Yeah, there's a llama out there shooting people. - What the, don't tell them that! - Well, too late now. - No, I'm not joking, it's real. This isn't a prank. - They didn't believe you. - They hung up. - I'm calling Dad. - Oh, God. - Yeah, yeah? Mel? Huh, what? I can't understand you. - Dad, Dad? Dad? Floyd, I think our line is dead. - I gotta go, my kids need me. - You have kids? - A couple. - You're about to have a few. - Damn, that's nasty. - What is wrong with you? - What's wrong with him? - What is happening to me? - Let's just go, let's just go. Get out of here! - Guys? Guys? Where is everybody? Guys? - Come on, let's go, come on! - Guys? - This way, run, come on! - Come on, get up, come on, come on. - Tough break, kid. - Hey, hey, hey. We're not going any further with you, man. What the fuck are you talking about? - No, no, Dan's right. He's part of the reason the llama can chase us. - No, we're not just gonna leave him. - We have to leave him. It'll keep following us if we don't leave him. Go sit up somewhere else! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Fuck you guys, no, no. I'm a fucking llama man! - Is it a horse? No, is it an emu? No, what are you doing? This is not fun, this is not fun. - It's a spaceship. - Floyd, don't be stupid, it's not a spaceship. - Well obviously it's a space ship, just look at it. - Floyd, we're not on the Sci-Fi Channel, it's not a space ship. - It has wings like a space ship. It's red like a space ship. It's craft like a space ship, so it's, there's something out there killing people with unearthly powers that's obviously not from this world. - Floyd, wait. It's coming, it's coming, it's coming. - Hold on. - Dan, what is it? - Dan, I'm not sure that's safe. - Look what I found. - What is it? - It's a God damn space stick. I think it's a weapon. We can use this. Let's go! I got this. - Dan, look out. Hit that one out of the park, huh? Though we have not fought valiantly, many of our friends have perished. If for no other reason than this blazing eye beast's sick and twisted pleasure. Let them not die in vain! With this space stick, we will avenge them and we will win this wrestle between earth and space. Guys? This caused an alien event. Think about it, not even the government, people with money, the globalists, new world order, the Illuminati, they don't want you to know about alien technology. They want to keep that technology for themselves. Technology is power. - Aliens, my ass! Gosh darn it, can't even get a car to go 30 miles a gallon, how we gonna get to the moon? Bigfoot, maybe. - Floyd, we're trapped. - Just give me one moment. Over here! Floyd, how'd you know about this? - Grandpa showed me last summer. When they dodged the draft. Let's go! I'll tell you one thing, I'm not gonna work on some movie. - Let's go to the loft, I can't climb all of this. - Is it gone yet? - Let me go check. - My god! - It's most definitely not gone. - Damn kids and their laser beams. Fucking Bigfoot. What the fuck? - Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Kill me. - God! - Let's get out of here. - Come on, we can climb down over here. - When did you get so confident? - We can talk about that later. We need to get away from the llama right now. - Oh my god! What the fuck was that? Come on, baby, come and get some. - Floyd, I've got to tell you something. - Not now. - No, it has to be now, it has to be now. Look, your whole life, I've always just viewed you as this little boy. You were just this little boy to me. But now after all of this, after everything that's happened, I really am beginning to see you as a man. A little man, but a man. You're my little man brother. And I'm proud to call you my man brother, Floyd. I'm really proud to call you a man. A little man brother. - Marissa. - Mel. - Mel, something's changed tonight and I've never had the courage to say it before but I've always thought that you were just a boneheaded twizzle. And tonight, I realized you really are just a fucking boneheaded twizzle. - Floyd, that mean so much. I really hope that we make it out of this. Okay, little man? - Go, go, go, go. Just back up. - I've got you, son of a bitch. - Look out! - Hi kids. - Dad, you saved us! - It's what a father does. - How'd you know how to kill it? - Like most living things, you run them through a combiner, it'll pretty much take care of it. - Dad, we need to get you to a hospital. - I think it's a little late for that. - No, not it isn't. - There's time, we have time. Okay, it's bad, I just really don't want you to die, Dad. - Mel, I want you to know that you were always my favorite. - Thanks, Daddy. - That's okay, Mom was always my favorite, Dad. - That a boy, Floyd. And tell your mother, tell your mother. - Dad, I'll tell her, I'll tell Mom. - That she's a no good, dirty, rotten. - Dad, Daddy! â™ª Ladies and gentlemen â™ª â™ª Broadcasting live â™ª â™ª You've just witnessed â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª It's a llama, I'm gonna get it motherfucker â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª It's a llama, I'm gonna get it mutherfucker â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª It's a llama, I'm gonna get it mutherfucker â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª Oh, get down â™ª â™ª Red llama space ship in the sky â™ª â™ª Obliterate a space station â™ª â™ª In the blink of an eye â™ª â™ª Crash landing â™ª â™ª In an undisclosed location â™ª â™ª Llamageddon terrorize the whole nation â™ª â™ª Leave the bait in a casket â™ª â™ª Fan driving off from my funeral â™ª â™ª He can have it â™ª â™ª You see Mel, see we try to throw a party â™ª â™ª And on the side trying to get a blow for the shortie â™ª â™ª Who's then opposing the forces of evil â™ª â™ª Red eyed llama trying to startle all the people â™ª â™ª They ain't care everybody getting laid â™ª â™ª Now even our boy Floyd he be like I'm a man now â™ª â™ª A couple arguing they go outside â™ª â™ª Little do they know â™ª â™ª They in that llama laser sight â™ª â™ª End the party everybody getting covered in blood â™ª â™ª Guts and gore, it's time to go to war â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª It's a llama, I'm gonna get it motherfucker â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª It's a llama, I'm gonna get it motherfucker â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª It's a llama, I'm gonna get it motherfucker â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª Oh, get down â™ª â™ª Everybody in the hot tub getting shocked â™ª â™ª What the fuck â™ª â™ª Somebody call the cops and take a shot â™ª â™ª Then take another shot â™ª â™ª Then another nother shot â™ª â™ª Then another nother nother shot â™ª â™ª Blah blah â™ª â™ª Two motherfuckers get wrecked â™ª â™ª And poor Mark got sprayed with green paste â™ª â™ª And thus set in motion a llama transformation â™ª â™ª Blazing through the forest â™ª â™ª We gotta get away â™ª â™ª Ahhh, okay â™ª â™ª We found a space ship and a silver space stick â™ª â™ª Another llama attack yo it's time to face it â™ª â™ª Pop shows up in a fly combiner â™ª â™ª Fucked the llama right up â™ª â™ª And that llama dies â™ª â™ª But Pops also dies â™ª â™ª The survivors watch his soul float into the sky â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª It's a llama, I'm gonna get it motherfucker â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª It's a llama, I'm gonna get it motherfucker â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª It's a llama, I'm gonna get it motherfucker â™ª â™ª Llamageddon, Llamageddon â™ª â™ª Oh, get down â™ª â™ª Llama ask for something â™ª â™ª Llama get your name â™ª â™ª I'm gonna tell ya â™ª â™ª Your pussy got me going insane â™ª â™ª Llama hit it from the front â™ª â™ª Llama like it like that â™ª â™ª Llama hit from the back â™ª â™ª Stimulate my llama sack â™ª â™ª Hey shouts out to the films director â™ª â™ª Howie Dewin â™ª â™ª Follow me on Twitter â™ª â™ª At Doctor Syllable â™ª â™ª Hashtag Llamageddon â™ª â™ª Shouts out to all the actors in the movie â™ª â™ª Jacques M.
