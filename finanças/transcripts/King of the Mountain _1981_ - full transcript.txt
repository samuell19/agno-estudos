23 miles of Mulholland slicing Los Angeles like a knife, it's like a trip in time. Sometimes I just can't wait for night. You see too much in the sunshine. Roads changin'. Civilization's choking it. At night the straightaways are shorter. Turns sharper. Drop steeper. It's the only place I ever felt safe. I'm clear. I'm clean and fast. Freedom. I wonder who it'll be tonight. I hope he's fast. I take it you got the bank. Bank? Steve doesn't race for bread. Well if he wants us, it's 100 a pop. You gonna do it, or what? Hey ease up, hang on a second. What did you set up with them? Set up a race. Yeah but for $100? Trust me, we won't need it. That's all I needed to hear. Is your man ready? - Very ready. - The course clear? Mulholland's sealed off. Okay. Okay, friend, you want a run for your money? You're gonna get a run for your money. Not a chance, pal, not a chance. No way, no way. Not a bad idea. What do you say we nail their asses? Let's go.

Helicopter arrives on the scene... - They popped Steve, huh? - Puts the beam down - on everyone. - You two are a couple of assholes. Well I can only speak for myself.

I thought you were tapped out. Oh, third member of our little family moaned and groaned and cried, pull him out, but he finally came through. Roger? We got any other family, you know? Would you mind moving your Dodge out of the way? You got my car blocked. Do what? Move your car. No, no, we're not blocking your car. We're protecting it. That's right. - Protecting it, right. - Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, I'd move it but I don't have the keys, you know, I've been lookin' for 'em for a couple days. - Well, those are keys. - I don't where they are. I don't know where the keys are. - Those are keys. - Whoa, lookin' for these, are ya?

Thanks for calling. I got hung up. Hung up, huh? Yeah, I couldn't get to a phone. Well. Next time you do, don't call me. You and Iris set the date? Yeah, as a matter of fact, we were just trying to figure out whether or not to have a church wedding. Roger, they're gonna tie the knot. Hey, man, commitment, that's wonderful, whoopee, celebration, all right! As mom would say, "It's the promise of permanence, Roger." Jeez, look at this, here we are again. Oh shit. Downin' the last beer. Roger. As the sun comes up, how many times have we done this? You know what it is about this life? Cars that won't run. There's only one thing worse than cars that won't run. That's pushing a car that won't run. No, there's one thing worse than that, man. That's holding up a dead body. Lifting it up, yeah. Especially if it's yours. Resurrection, man, resurrection! Hey, Davey. Cigarette? No, no, no, I'm quitting. How's that thing runnin', Steven? Oh, she's perfect, wanna drive her? Nothing better than perfect, my man. Hey Hot Dog, some chick stopped by to see you, man. Well, who was it? I didn't catch her name. Toss me that number 14, will you? Who was it? I don't know. She's got long brown hair, drives an old red Datsun, no, it's a. Oh, yeah? What'd you tell her? What'd I tell her? Yeah. I told her you had a small dick, man. Friend, you are a good friend. He's right. The old days, they were crazy. They'd race Mulholland from here all the way to the ocean. This is Grandstand. Watch the action from up there. Atta boy, Steve! Those freaks your fan club? That's part of it. Cops hassle you a lot, huh? Yeah, sometimes, there's usually always somebody up here. Mainly, though, on Friday and Saturday nights it doesn't stop. Does anyone go over the edge? All the time. Gotta ride the edge if you wanna win. Here comes the meanest curve on the hill. The Dead Man. Rodan Stan, Boogie Man, Sweeper. Carl's. Who makes up the names? Who knows? They've been racing up here for about 30 years. That guy you met at the shop, Cal? He bought it right here 15 years ago. They pieced him back together, he hasn't raced since. Made him a legend. He had to drive to the end of the road. Wasn't just winning for Cal. He had to see you lose. Hotshot. Who's that? I got a surprise for you. Hey, friend, you lookin' for a little action? Winner takes the pink slip. Winner takes the girl. Come on, Steve. - Give up? - Now, Steve. All right. - Feel that? - What? The vibration. No. Buddy, Roger and I went up to Mulholland one night. Couldn't believe our eyes, people jamming back and forth. Anyway, after that, we were hooked. Can't picture Roger racing. Oh, he was really good. He had this green Camaro that could really fly. Then one day he lost it, he, he hit the mountain and wrapped himself around a telephone pole but he was all right. He showed up a couple days later in this Jag. He ran through the course once and that was the last time. Two dogs, a couple of fries and Cokes? That's us. Here. You love it, don't ya? What? The hill. It's a good place to go fast. I guess there are a lot of good places to go fast. I don't know, it's special. I grew up there. You know, I didn't used to be able to go to sleep at night until I'd run that course at least once. I was afraid I'd miss something, some, some action I didn't know was going on. It was the first place where, where people talked about me when I wasn't there. You know what I mean? I can drive that course blindfolded. I know when to shift, when to gas, when to brake. I know the perfect line, I've got that place wired, I own it. It's mine. It's kinda early for you, ain't it, Hotshot? Kinda. I have to talk to you. Talk it out. Maybe I'm going crazy. I felt something last night. Coming into Sweeper. I was right where I should've been, right where I always am. That's where I felt it. Kinda came up through the road, it went right through me. It's not the car. I know it's not the car. And I was up there this morning. Road's the same. The same road. No bumps, same groove. What is it, Cal? Fear, man. Fear. It's a monster. You know, you know that thing that jerks your head back, you know? Locks your jaw and clenches your teeth. Fear. Makes that mean gleam about you, Joker. You know what I mean? The whole world, man. Just blurs and thunders. Makes that car of yours like a runaway knife. Know what I mean? Basically, it's just a thrill maker. You understand what I mean? A thrill maker. But he's a cannibal. And you're gonna hear all sorts of things. You're gonna hear rippin' and tearin' and all over the place, all around you, you understand what I mean, Mister? Because he's here. He's here. You watch out for him. Because now you know his secret. 'Cause he's clockin' your ass, Joker. Looking very nice. Hi, how you doin'? Hey, hey, hey! Now you're talkin'. That is really very sweet of you. My favorite combination. Roger, no way. - No way, not this one. - What, come on, one bite. - Out. - I don't believe it. Would you deny me, your best friend? I may be your best friend but I'm no fool. Make your own, Roger. Come on, one bite's not gonna kill you. Take off. You've gotta understand something, Roger. There are certain aesthetic considerations involved here. I created the masterpiece, I get the first bite. Now? In a second. Now? Be careful, please. That's great. Basic purple. Goes well with my jeans, huh? Who's he got in there now? Tina. Wouldn't you know it, I'm the one making her a star, he's the one making it between her legs. Hey, are you crazy? - That's gross. - This is my shirt. If this doesn't come out, you're buying me a new shirt. Sue me! What's the matter with you, there's a little edge goin' on there, the action in there gettin' to you too? Romeo and Juliet gettin' you so upset? Romeo and Juliet gettin' you so upset?

My father used to go away on business trips and he would shake hands with my mother. - You're not serious. - Yeah. I don't know, I guess it's all a little more radical when you look back on it.

Yeah. It's Arnie Rifkin. - Call him back. - I'm sorry. I need what I just heard for Cadillac Blue. They're dry, they need material and I want an album out on 'em before Christmas. Well, wait a minute, Barry, I thought that I was here today to talk about us recording and anyway, my friend would never go for that. These songs are him, he's never gonna let anybody record 'em before we do. You think he's a song writer? He's not shit. When I cut his material, that's when he becomes a song writer, huh? Barry, I cannot sell this thing to him. I mean, what do you wanna do in this business, Roger? You wanna be a record producer? Or do you wanna be your friend's song schlepper? It's up to you, baby.

This is no big deal or anything, I just came by to let you know that everything's okay. I thought about it. This morning I was a little blown out. I'm straight now. Great, I'm glad to hear that.

You wanna leave a party like this and go up to the hill. Yeah, old times' sake. Wouldn't make the same mistake twice. Buddy Dunn, right? Yeah. - Barry Tanner. - Oh, nice to meet you. Congratulations, we're cutting four of your songs next week. Yeah, Barry, I was just in the middle of explaining - all that stuff to them. - Excuse me, what did you just say? We're recording four of his tunes next week. Hey, no, it's okay, you don't have to hype me here. You didn't tell him, huh? I haven't had the chance... Never mind, I'll break the good news to him myself. Yeah, we're doing four of your tunes with Cadillac Blue. The top, right, come on down, meet 'em, you'll enjoy it. Listen, I gotta go, you know, the host with the most. Enjoy yourselves, fellas. What's going on, Roger? Hey, Roger, did you know about this last night? You kidding, Tanner told me 10 minutes ago. That's why I wanted to go up in the hill so that I have a chance to break it to you there. He conned us, man. He told me he liked the songs then went and signed 'em off to some twit. We got conned. He's lying, you're lying. What are you talking about, Buddy? Why would you do it? If he wanted the songs for Cadillac Blue, you had to know they were good, right? We coulda recorded these, Roger, ourself, without Tanner. - No. - We coulda got somebody else - to bankroll us. - I didn't know he wanted it for Cadillac Blue, now we got taken. I tell ya, it's still a good deal. It's gonna put you on the charts as a song writer like that. I can't believe you both did this to me. - Buddy. - Hey, Roger. You sold him out. You sold him out and you used me to do it. This has happened to me. This has happened to me. I got four aces. Can you move this red bomber here? I gotta get this speedster out. Hey, Billy, Billy!

Wanna go for it, I'm going for it tonight! Oh, no, think you're the best? No, man, you're the best. No, no. Too fast for me, man. Mothers, that's what we used to call you, mothers. Stay at home, mom. How 'bout you, man? You're the fastest on the hill, aren't ya? Hey, man, not me, not tonight. I'll run with you. Music maker. Organ grinder. Yeah, I've heard it all tonight. I don't need to hear anymore. You're over your head tonight, boy. I said I'll run with you. Now can you get it together to tell me whether you are in or out? I'm ready. All right! Pissant! Let's start this booger down the road. Hey, you seen Buddy? Yeah, him and Cal just took off about 10 seconds ago, they just... Straight down the highway, gone. - Cal? - Yeah. To play footsie with fate, you gotta think. You got it now? You got it now? Go. Hey, pull the line, Buddy, pull the line! Take it back, boy, you ain't got it. This a big boy's game, that's what. Don't you understand that I'm up here? Hey! Hey, sit on it! I said, sit on it! Hey, Buddy, what are you doin'? Come on! Pull back on it, Buddy, pull back! That's too fast, no! That's too fast, Buddy. Too fast. Too fast. Why? Why? Why? Buddy! Sorry about your friend, man. Yeah, thanks, appreciate it. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Why don't you go home and take it easy? You're a man short. It's all right, I'll take care of it. - Hey, Rick? - Yeah? Kinda like to stick around. Nowhere else to go. Come on, I got something to show you. I took this picture over 15 years ago. So? I haven't been back on that hill since. Haven't been back because I knew it was over for me up there. I don't know how I did but I did. It's over for you too now. You have nothin' to prove. It doesn't matter to anybody but Cal, don't you understand that? You don't need that race. He does. You think about that. I want you to think about it real hard. I didn't know when I was gonna see you again. Wasn't your fault. You look pretty. Thanks. Where you goin'? Roxy. Barry's showcasing a new act. You never stop, do you? Sittin' around here's not gonna make me feel any better. Why don't you meet us there? Not tonight. You gonna go fast tonight? As fast as I can. Fast as you can, back and forth. Back and forth. Where's it gonna take you? Nowhere. That won't bring him back, you know? Miss Wells? Would you please tell Miss Wells her car is here? Yeah, sure, just a minute. Your car is here. A limo, no less. Take it easy. Feels like a commitment. You gonna be here tonight when I get back? That's the girl's line, remember? You mean if you get back. Some fan. Some chump. Hey, this is the guy from Downing. He said he's heard about you, he liked your action. Not tonight. I saw him race last Friday, he's really quick, man. No, I'm not in the mood. Beat it. I got it, go for it, go for it! Turn on it, turn on it, turn! It's me against the clock, man, it's time, man, time is speed, speed is time. Oh, man, that's some good shit, man. I don't wanna become Cal.
