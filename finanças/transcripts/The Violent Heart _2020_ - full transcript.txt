Can I have this? Why? It's garbage. Well, it reminds me of you. - Stop it. - Come on, get up. - Dad's home. - What? Already? Yeah. You've been asleep all day. Daniel! Daniel. Dad! Dad! You're so crazy! I missed you so much out there, you have no idea. We missed you too. I miss you, baby girl. I missed you too, dad. Why you so quiet over there? Usually, you're a little chatterbox, huh? So what's the deal? Tired. Yeah? Looks like we're going. All right. Okay. Daniel. What do you have to say for yourself? Wendy! Wendy! Where are you? - What? - I didn't say anything. Okay, then. - Daniel? - Yes, ma'am. Have you thought about what you're gonna say to the senator? Everybody I talk, they say it's just a formality. Still, it doesn't mean you can't be prepared. We can do a mock interview. I can come up with a few questions. What'd you think? I think I'll be fine. All right. Mom, can you drive me somewhere after dinner? Oh, no, baby, I got so much to do today. I wanna visit Wendy. Why? I don't know. I just feel like it. "...through our bad performance, 'Twere better not assay'd... therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold, If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see: We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't: When in your motion you are hot and dry and make your bouts more violent to that end. And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him a chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping, if he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, Our purpose may hold there. But stay what noise, How now, sweet queen!" "One woe doth..." Um, sorry. "One woe doth tread upon another's heel, So fast they follow: your sister's drowned, Laertes." Brad? - Oh, shit! - Where are you, Bradley? It's my bad. Uh... "Drown'd! O, where?" "There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream. There with fantastic garlands did she come Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples That the liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them: There on the pendant boughs..." What, Bradley again? Winter formal. His girlfriend just dumped him. I kind of feel bad. Am I like, obligated to go with him? Show me. It's not like I don't wanna go with him. I just don't wanna go at all. It's gonna be a bunch of his friends just smoking and playing video games and half of them won't even go to the dance. - So what's the point? - Well, I will say this. You should be socializing with your peers, however puerile they may be. Honestly, I say go. It's senior year. Go make some memories. Oh, God. Hey, you're a grown woman. Free to do as she pleases. Yeah, you're right. I have to stay after school. I'll... I'll wait for you. It's okay. I'll get a ride from one of the baseball guys. Jeff or something. All right. Here you go. Oh, I wanted to get an oil change. - Would you do that for me? - Gotcha. You got me? - Hey, Rick! - Yeah? Check the serpentine, bro. - What now? - The serpentine. - Right? - Oh, shit. Yeah. Uh, ma'am. We got a potential problem with the car. Do you want to step out and take a look? Um, uh, yeah. So this is a serpentine belt. Located in front of the engine. And what it does, it connects like the water... - All right, Rick. - All right. Hi, sorry! Are either of you Daniel? - Uh, yeah. - Hey, uh... I was just talking to a guy in there, and he said that you may be going to Bedfield to pick up your brother. From Bedfield High School, I mean. - Yeah. - I'm just wondering because I have to leave my car here overnight, and I'm going there. Is there any... I know this is weird, but is there... Can you give me a ride? Uh, yeah, sure. I got you. - Yes? - No problem. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm just gonna go get my stuff and... Okay. Bye. Thanks for the ride. Oh, it's no problem. I was already going this way, so... Oh, I know this book. My dad got it for me. Used to make me do all these book reports so I could remember, like, writing the theme, and who's the protagonist, and who's the antagonist, - and all that stuff. - Right, right. 'Cause he's an English teacher. He's actually my English teacher, which isn't that weird, weirdly like you would think it's weird, because, ew, why would you want your dad as a teacher? But he's harder on me than he is with anyone. And if anything, it just pushes me to do better because... - I'm sorry. I'm gonna keep talking. - No, it's fine. So if you, feel free to chime in or just, like, - cut me off completely. - No, 'cause you were going... - You were just telling me a story. - No, no, no. I just tend to talk a lot when I'm uncomfortable, so... You don't seem uncomfortable. Trust me, I am. No, come on. You're leaning back, chilling. Touching my stuff. You seem all right, to me. No touching the books. I got it. No, you can... you can touch the book if you want to. - It's a good book. - No, we can... we can sit in silence. Listen to the wind. You know, I hate... I hate... I hate silence. The only person I can actually sit in silence with is my dad. And even then, I'm like, I need to say something. What? You talk about your dad a lot. A lot. No, I don't. Do I? Oh, my God. I do. I do! I mean, it's okay, you know, talking about your dad. - You love your dad. It's fine. - Oh, my God! That is devastating. Well, you tell me something now. - To... to even it out. - Me? - You want me to what? - Tell me an embarrassing story. - Come on, you must have one. - Embarrassing? Embarrassing, something uncool. No, I've been, uh... I've been cool my whole life, so, that's... that's a task. Oh, you've been cool your whole life. I'm just saying. - You're just a... - Tough guy. - ...big old man. - There you go. - Now we're talking. - You do man stuff. - "Hey!" - All day, every day. - "Want me to fix your motorcycle?" - I do that. "I can be that." - Is that how I sound? - Yeah. You see through me. But guess what? I see through you, too. Fair enough. Ouch! What the hell? Asshole. That is so pretty. Well, thank you for the ride. Um, I'll see you tomorrow. Actually. No. I'm going to Nashville tomorrow. Oh! What's... What's in Nashville? Uh, a meeting. I'm trying to enlist. In the army? Marines. Oh, sorry, hi! - I'm Cassie. - Hello. Nice to meet ya. Yeah, what's wrong with you? His name's Aaron. I'm sorry. I always liked that name. - He picked it out. - No way. Really? Yeah. My dad just gave him a book and he picked the first one he saw. - First one, huh? - Yeah, well. - Well, it was nice to meet you guys. - Likewise. Bye. - Shut up, Aaron. - What? - I didn't say anything, - Yeah, okay. I'm literally just looking at you. Do you always look at me... Hello? - Dad? - Hold on! Hold on. I've just gotta... - Hey! What was that? - What are you doing here? Hey. This bulb was driving me crazy flickering, and I finally just took it down myself. Uh, anyway, I think suspension is the wrong move here. When's the last time we talked to his parents? - Yeah, I'll call him. Thank you. - Okay. - Thanks. - Hi, Cassie. I should call Jeff off since you're here, huh? I don't... I don't have the car. - What happened? - The belt broke. - Wait, what? - It was about to. And they got you to replace the timing belt? It wasn't the timing belt, it was a different belt. - It was a... - Serpentine belt? Yeah. Still, I wish you would have just called me first. It's okay. ...best relievers. Right before State, man. I... I ain't got no bullpen. I... I got nothing, you know. Only got one thing on their mind. One thing on their mind. And I'm still trying to figure out what it is. - Not schoolwork. - Not schoolwork. Quite not pitching either. I don't think it's sports related. - Kids these days. - Kids. - You know what I'm saying? - Oh, God. Joseph. - Hey, remember Min? Joseph? - Who's that again? You know, that little Vietnamese lady? Teaches my yoga class? You know what she says to me? She tells me I should teach the class. - Huh. - Can you believe she said that? - Go sit. Go sit over there. - Thanks. - But when does it start? - Mm... Oh, I'm not gonna teach a class. - Why not? - Oh! I can say my wife is a yoga instructor. That's pretty hot. You okay? - Yeah. Fine, fine. - Fine, fine. Come on. What are you so moody about? That pressure finally starting to get to you? Last semester. Well, I hope you're finding some way to relax. You can't just be studying all the time. Come on. When's the last time you just went out and had fun? I... I don't know. Well, maybe you need to do something about that. Maybe I'll take the day off tomorrow. There you go. Wait, take the day off from... You mean ditch school? Yeah, maybe see my friends at Vanderbilt. Oh, I don't think you can do that. - Can she? - No. That's ridiculous. Why? Because you can't skip school. That's why. Is that what you told me this morning? What did I tell you this morning? That I'm a grown woman? Free to do as I please? Can you believe this girl using my own words against me? Where you going? I have homework. - Hello? - Hi. Thanks for picking up. Sure. What are you up to? I was about to go to bed. So early? Yeah, early to bed, early to rise, you know. 8:00 p.m., bedtime, your mom comes to tuck you in. That's right. Whereas, I bet you're a night owl. - Oh, yeah, all the way. - Staying up late, hitting all the clubs, trying to be seen. There's so many clubs. I just gotta hit 'em all. Anyway, um... So the real reason I'm calling you is, um, I was wondering if you're still going to Nashville tomorrow. Yeah. I'm going to... I'm going, too. Tomorrow. Oh, okay. Um, and I thought since you so graciously gave me a ride today that I could repay the favor and give you a ride. Assuming that you guys fix my car in time. Or is that not a safe assumption? No, uh, uh... That's really nice of you. I just, uh... I was just gonna take my bike to Nashville. - Your motorcycle? - Yeah. Did you have room for one more? Uh, that's a... that's a bad idea, 'cause I just wasn't looking to get... involved... ...with anyone. Who says I'm looking to get involved? - Uh, I mean... - Wow. Don't you have school tomorrow? You have school? Yes, that's not an issue. And your dad? He's cool with you going? Yes. - With me? - Yes. Yes. I'm sorry, uh... This, this... It feels like something we shouldn't be doing. Look. I'm a... I'm a senior in high school. Okay? I'm... I'm 18, so... - Hello? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I... Um... I'm here. So what do we do? Whoo! Oh, my God! My God, that was amazing. - Whoo! - Take a minute. Do you have to go right away? What do you... What do you... Yeah, I should probably go. Get there early, you know. Cool. But I can... I can text you when I'm done. Okay, yeah. - Okay. - That's... Yeah, I'm... I don't have much to do, so... Cool. Okay, well... - Bye. - See ya. Come on. Hey, it's Melissa. Leave me a message. The mailbox is full. I cannot accept any messages. Mr. Harris? - Yes. - Thought that was you. - RJ. - Oh, of course. Good to finally meet you in person. Yes, me too. Uh, you too. Come on in. So my office receives about 50 requests a year. I sponsor two... three this year including you. A little about me. My brother. He also had a felony conviction. Same issue. And so, one of the things I said to myself if I ever got elected was to try to use my position as a leader to advocate for people who have maybe made a mistake but are ready to commit themselves to something greater. - That make sense? - Yes, ma'am. Good. Next week, you're going to sit down with the battalion commander. His name is Adam Kane, Lt. Col. Adam Kane. Now I'm gonna grease the wheels a little bit, but you need to remember this is his decision to make. - Of course. - So what I need from you is ammunition, so to speak. I need something that maybe your record or, you know, a piece of paper isn't going to communicate. Sure, um... Well, I got my GED last year. Uh, I guess, it's a, um, piece of paper. What was that like? Going back to school? Oh, no, it was just an exam. - So, uh... - Okay. So maybe you can tell me about having a parent in the armed forces. Your father's a high ranking officer. Uh, it definitely impacted me. Um, you look at a guy like my dad and, uh... Sorry. - It's okay. - Um... It's okay. Take your time. You know, I think the worst part about when I went to prison was seeing what it did to him. I remember the day that he dropped me off. He was telling me to be strong and all of that, and he grabbed me by the shoulders and he looked at me one last time, and, uh, I could really see how hard he was... he was struggling with it. He didn't like who he saw. I didn't like who he saw. But I know that's not who I am, and I wanna finally do something, anything to prove that. I don't know how that sounds. It sounds like the truth. - Hi. - Hey. - Sorry, we started without you. - That's all right. Um, this way. So how'd it go? Are you in? Uh, still got one more meeting, but that's pretty much it. Crazy that the whole point of the army was you kind of just signed up. Yeah, well, it's the Marines. Oh, are they more selective? Uh, yeah, yeah, but my dad's in the Corps, so I think he's gonna... He's gonna try to pull some strings. Is he the one making you enlist? Two Jameson. Open or close? Um, closed actually. You know, it's kind of loud in here, right? Yeah, I, uh... I don't really drink. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Yeah, sorry. I should have said... - No, you shouldn't... - It's okay. Don't worry about it. Hey, you guys want these? - Uh... - All yours. - Sure. - Sorry about that. Hey. Hey, I'm Ross. What's your name? I'm Cassie. So, Cassie, do you just go around the bars buying drinks for handsome strangers? Uh... Hey, I'm kidding. Next round's on me. No. No, I insist. I'm a gentleman. I was really trying to get rid of 'em. Rid of 'em? Did you... You roofied these, didn't you? You know, there are easier ways. Okay, here. How about we both drink them at the same time? Hey, I need to... - Oh... - Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here. Hey, dude, are you two... Shit, man. I didn't realize she was your girl, man. Pretty sure she's her own girl. That's not what I... Hey. Yo, hey. Hey, bro, bro, hey... Whoa. - Get off of me, man. - Just fucking relax. Don't touch me. All right. Shit. - I'm sorry, dragged you in there. - No. no. I'm sorry. Just... I started to really feel like I was gonna hit him. - l wanted to hit him. - God, I wanted to slap him right in the face. You... You don't understand. I have a record, Cassie. - What? - A record. I went to prison. That's why I'm here. That's why I can't... I can't just sign up for the Marines. Oh. What'd you do? Got into a fight in high school. This kid came from behind, pushed me, so I turned around and I hit him. Hard as I could. And blinded him. His right eye. Oh. You went to jail for that? - Yes. - Even though he started it? That's not... I'm saying this is a problem for me. I hurt people. There was this one time in middle school, this boy called me a slut, so I took his glasses off and I stomped on 'em. So... I mean, technically, we both blinded people. I'm sorry. I didn't say that to make you feel better. It's true. Okay. How are you like this? Like what? Like nothing bothers you. You're just easy going. What else do you like about me? What else? A lot of stuff. Well, tell you what I like about you? - Okay. - You're ready? Mm-hm. This is gonna be a lot harder to do back home. You think we can do this back home? Honestly, I say come pick me up from school Monday morning. I'll ditch again. I don't give a fuck. I like the way you look at me. The hell? Yeah? Looks like we're going. All right. Okay. Daniel. What do you have to say for yourself? What am I supposed to say? Uh, hi. Hi, Daddy. Hello. We miss you. That's what you're supposed to say. Come on, Daniel. I don't know. Pass. Pass? All right. All right, baby girl, what do you got to say? Come on. Um, hi. - Hello. - That's it? I'm 8000 miles away, all right? Alone in the desert. Come on. I don't know, Dad. She don't know. Well, nobody knows anything, ladies and gentlemen. Hi, It's me, Daniel. So I finally thought of something to say. I just wanna tell you that I really miss you, and it's gonna be boring, and things aren't gonna be the same as usual without you. And please come back 'cause I miss you every day. Okay, bye. Hey, Mom. What's one fact about you? You can't come up with one fact? Um... There you are. Aaron's gonna be late for school. I'll be ready in a second. Wait, wait, hold on. You in a good mood. Morning, Mom. Hm. Oh, I know. Weren't you trying to be a lawyer at some point? Oh, yeah. I thought about going to law school. Have my books and everything. I was in. - Really? - Yeah. So why didn't you go? Well... Sometimes things just don't work out the way we expect them to. Aaron, let's go. - Bye. - Bye, sweetie. Hey, Daniel. Where were you all weekend? You know, I had that meeting. The whole weekend? I was hanging with that girl. - What girl? - You met her. Oh. Oh, that girl? Okay, so, um, what did y'all do? You know, whatever. Let's go. "Whatever". All right, bro. Well, let me just tell you. It's about time you got a girlfriend, man. Yeah, it might have just been a one-time thing. She dumped you already? No, it's just... It isn't a good idea. Why? No, no, wait, wait. Like, why isn't it a good idea? It just isn't. Is it because she's 18? Still in high school or... Because she's white? Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Honestly, do you... You wanna know what I really think? Nope, I don't. - Should I just go, um... - Si, por favor. Gracias. Hey, cool story, bro. Hey. Yo. What is your problem? Is that why your dad did what he did? Because you're so freaking annoying. Hey! There's a lot going on at home. I'm... I'm sorry. That won't happen. Yeah. Aaron, come here. Tell him you're sorry. - What? - Say, "Kent, I'm very sorry for what I said to you." - Say it! - No. - He... He's the one who hit me! - Aaron! That boy's father is dead. Do you understand what that feels like? Now tell him you sorry. Please. No. Okay. - Go wait in the car. - Why? Just do it. Finished already? Where are you going? Bathroom. With all your stuff? - Yeah. - Wait a minute. Here. Take the pass. Oh, my God. Can't believe you really came for me. This was your idea. So when do you find out about the Marines? I got my last meeting this weekend. Something wrong? Mm-mm. Are you sure? What's up? I think my dad's cheating on my mom. Shit. Really? - Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... - No, I... I didn't... I don't... I didn't want to... I just feel so fucking angry at him. When I'm alone or... Like right now, and I... And when I'm with him, I feel like I am not allowed to feel angry. Like I have to protect his feelings because he's my dad, no matter how fucked up the thing he did is and... He's just acting completely normal. I mean, what is that? What is that? Is that... is that normal? Is that like a... Is that a guy thing to just pretend like everything's okay and... I mean... Kinda. Yeah. I just hate being angry. I hate it. I... I just want to get rid of it. How do I do that? Forgive him. I mean I'm not saying that you should but... I don't know. Anger's... It's... it's tricky, you know. It's like the longer you're angry about something... You carry it around with you long enough, you start to not even notice it. You just kind of get to be an angry person. I have to tell you something. Okay. I know about your sister. I thought it was weird not telling you that I knew. I'm so sorry. No, uh, it's all right. It's, um... It was hard never finding out who did it, but, uh, it's been a... But sometimes, you know, it is what it is, but... We don't have to talk about it. Cassie? Yeah? Come here. Sit down. - What is this? - We would like to talk to you. Sit down. Uh, we're not here to lecture you about skipping school. Although, that is getting to be a problem. The problem is that boy you were with. Daniel Harris. How'd you all meet? Uh... At the car place when I dropped the car off. - He works there. - And he... he just started talking to you? Yeah. I mean, I asked for a ride. What's... what's the big deal? We know this guy, you know. - He used to go to Bedfield. - He's not a good person. And he's not somebody that you should be spending your time with. - Wait. What? - You know he went to jail? Yes. What... Is that it? He's a bad person 'cause he went to jail? How about he is older than you? Okay, he's 24. - How about he's... - What we're really worried... - He's a violent criminal. - What's... What's really bothering us, honey, is that you've been hiding it from us. Now you could see why that would bother us. Since when do you feel like you have to hide things? - What made you think you have to do that? - I don't... I don't know, Dad. People hide relationships. Is that... That's what this is about? I was changing a light bulb the other day. I... I moved my desk for a second and she thinks... I don't even know... What is it that you think that I was doing, huh? What? You think I was having sex with Sharon Tillerson? In a classroom? Are you out of your mind? I would lose my job immediately! No pension, no health care! Career over! I wouldn't be able to afford the house. - Wouldn't be able to afford your college! - Okay. - There goes your entire future! - Okay, she understands. After all that we've done for you. - Okay. - Who else? Hey. hey. Don't do that. Don't do that, Cassie. Cassie, come here! Come back here. I don't even recognize this. You don't recognize this? Yeah. This whole defensive thing you're doing. No, this is not who you are. Oh, please tell me who I am. You are an intelligent, confident, amazing... Hey. Cassie. Cassie. Do not walk away while I'm talking to you! I'm sorry. I forgive you. - Ready to go? - Yes, sir. - Let him in. - Yes, sir. He's ready for you. Come in. Thank you for seeing me, sir. I really appreciate it. How could I refuse? Your dad is legendary around here. Oh, man. - Please. - Oh. Oh, this... Look, I'm not gonna waste your time here. I really struggled with this one. You've got some great credentials, but... I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to approve your waiver at this time. You mean, you... you can't do it right now or... No, not at all. - Sir, may I ask why? - You have a violent felony. Simple as that. Waivers are only granted under special circumstances, and yours does not qualify. Sir, if I may, uh... If I may, uh, draw your attention to a pass recruit. Uh, Mark Williams. - We had the exact same conviction. - No, this isn't... In fact, he did more jail time. You're not gonna do it this way. Sir, I'm just saying it's the exact same situation. Okay. Okay. Okay. When was this? July, 2003, sir. Well, this isn't July, 2003 now, is it? Look. You got your diploma, you got a job. I read through the letter from your parole officer. You're taking great care of your mom and your little brother. You are a young man who's ready to commit himself to something greater. It's just not gonna be the Marines. Yeah, you slide under, you go down, B. Down, B. - Ooh. See that? You see that? - Yeah. Hey. Hang on. - Hey. - I didn't get in. What? I didn't get in the Marines. Shit. Is there anything you can do? Probably start over, you know. The army or the navy. I don't know, it'll probably just be the same thing. I'm sorry. My dad is gonna be so disappointed. Well, how do you feel about it? You know, 'cause a lot of the times, I feel like I'm just... playing the part everyone wants me to play instead of just doing what I want, you know. I mean, here I am at this pre-party, about to go to winter formal. And all I really want to do is just hang out with you. Hello? - Daniel? - Uh, yeah, I, uh... I heard you. I'm sorry. I, uh... I have to go. My, uh... - I'm sorry. - No, no, of course. Daniel? - Yeah. - Why aren't you answering your phone? Well, what happened? What did the commander say? - I didn't get in. - What? I didn't get in. I should have just gone to that Colonel. You know what? That's exactly what I'm gonna do. - Ma, please. Ma, Ma... - It's not too late. That's what I'm gonna do. No, no, no, I've had enough of proper channels bullshit. Please just don't call dad right now. Don't call dad. - After everything we... - Ma, it's done. Uh-uh. After all the hoops they made us jump through. After everything we've done for them, you make one mistake and they wanna hold it against you for life? The hypocrisy of these people. Isn't that just the rule? Can't be in the military if you've been in jail. There are no rules. They do whatever they want. You should know that by now. You just take Daniel's side no matter what, huh? Of course I do. He's my son. And how come you never take my side? I saw you apologize... to Kent. - He hit me. I never even touched him. - Aaron. Aaron! Listen, you want to know why I apologized to that boy? - Because you hate me. - No, Aaron. Yes. I should have punched him so hard that I blinded him. Maybe then you would have been on my side. - Boy, you don't know what you're saying. - With Daniel, - it's "he's my son". - Aaron, listen to me. - Nobody talk about Daniel because "he's my son". - Stop it, Aaron. - But with me... - That's not true. You treat me like I'm not even a part of the stupid family. - All right, Aaron. - It's okay if you like Daniel more than me. It's fine. It... it would just be nice if you admitted that for once. Aaron! Shut up! - Shut up. - What? Listen. Listen. By the way... If somebody hits you, that doesn't give you permission to hit him back. You wanna be a real man, you take the punch. And you fucking walk away. All right. All right, baby girl, come on. What do you have to say? Um... I... Hello. That's it? I'm 8,000 miles away, all right? Alone in the desert. Come on. I don't know, dad. Can I have this? It reminds me of you. - Hey. - What are you doing here? Wanted to talk to you. You weren't answering your phone. I was worried. What is that? Something I made when I was a kid. I had two of 'em, but... My sister took one with her the night she died. Look, I know the Marines was super important to you, but I was thinking maybe this could be a good thing. Stop it. Stop doing that. Stop. You think you understand everything. You don't. You have no idea. I wanted to join the Marines. That wasn't my dad telling me to do all that shit. That was my one chance. To start over. That was it. And you... I'm gonna be here changing oil for the rest of my life. I got nothing. You can't see what you have. - You will get through this. - I'm... You will. And I'm not going anywhere. Okay? I'm right here. I promise. All right. Come on, Cassie. "Not from his mouth, Had it th' ability of life to thank you. He never gave commandment for their death. But since so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arrived, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view, And let me speak to th' yet-unknowing world How these things came about. So shall you hear of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on..." "Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience. For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune." - Cassie. - Yeah. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You seem a little tired. I was just up late. - You all right, honey? - Yeah. Cassie, can I come in? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just one second. - Hey. - Hey. Burning the midnight oil, huh? Yeah. Uh... I, um, wanted to ask you something. But, um... What? I... I need the car really early tomorrow, uh, so if you don't mind getting a ride from Mom. Yeah. Thanks. Hm. - Good night. - Night. Um, I... Hello? What are you still doing up? Um, I was just... Where are you going? I'm gonna go get Cassie. I think she might be in some kind of trouble. What happened? I don't know. Go to bed, Aaron. Cassie... I don't know what compelled you to write this... or what it is you think I did. Cassie. Cassie! Please tell me what this is all about. She was in your car. That night she died, she was in your car. Who? - Who? Who is this person... - You know who. You mean that boy's sister, huh? You know what her name is. Wendy Harris. Everybody knows who she... I know you killed her. Okay, listen. Okay? Listen. You want the truth? This is it. I did. I made a mistake. I had an affair with that girl. But... but Cassie, listen. Listen to me. She was... She was not in her right mind. She wasn't. I told her this can't keep happening. This has got to stop. And she told me that if I didn't run away with her, she was gonna go to the police. And at that point, it wasn't just about me anymore. It was about us. Okay? She made it about us. She threatened my family. Okay? That was her choice. When you have children, you'll understand what I'm talking about. - Yes, you will. - No. You protect your family no matter what. I didn't want... I didn't want to lose my family. I just didn't wanna lose you. I didn't wanna lose you. But listen, I let you know. You need to tell me everything you know, because this can't get out. Okay? It cannot get out. Nothing good can come of that, you know that. You know that, don't you? No good will come of that. Baby, come on. You know that. Hey, come on, babe. He's still lying to you, Cass. - No. - He's still lying to you. Daniel. No. Tell her what you left out. Just wait a second, okay? It's all over. It's all over. - Tell her what? - Tell her everything. Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. We can go to the police. Please. Please, it's not worth it. Just listen. Listen to me. Let's go, okay? Let's go. No. No. Daniel, let's just go. No! No, no, no! No! No! Please! Daniel! No! Please! Wendy. Wendy, wake up. Come on, get up. I can't. You okay? Okay, just breathe. Okay? Call an ambulance! Cassie. Shh. I have to... tell you... What? What? What? What is it? Daniel. You're all right now. Where's Wendy? Is she all right? I'm very sorry. Sorry? What? What do you mean? She lost a lot of blood. No. Oh, God. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, no! Um, but her baby has a shot. Wait, what baby? He... he's your brother. He's your brother. Who? What... what do you mean "my brother"? That's him. He's early, but he's a fighter. Oh, my God. Daniel, listen up. That... that little boy in there, that... that is your new baby brother. You understand? Miss? There's a young man here. He wants to speak with you.
