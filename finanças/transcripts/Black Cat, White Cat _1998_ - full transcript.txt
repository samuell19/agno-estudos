With this money your daddy will ensure you have a future... ...and your children's future. - Leave me be. I'll never forgive you. - Zare! - Zare! - What do you want now? - Come son, take a look at this miracle! - Now that's what I call an invention. ...only those Germans can invent something like that. ...but your daddy promises you... ...if we become rich, he'll buy you a ship like that... - Zare! ...Dadan... ...he's here! Our benefactor has arrived! (music/singing...) "Pitbull. Terrier...." - Fortune favours the bold. - Your mother....I keep you fed and this is how you thank me?! - "The dice is cast." - Welcome, my dear brother. - Who is he? - What the fuck do you care? - I was only asking. - Well shut the fuck up! Ehh... - Ohhh fuck... - So there's a God after all. - What are you staring at? Stop staring. Chill out! Read something! - Why did you come here? - I'm sick of these thieves around... - What are you waiting for? Give the man something to drink. Quit fucking laming around... - I've know of a lucrative plan. - You? - Trust me, it's 100% fail-safe. ...it's the plan of the millennium. ...I've got a connection in Jordan. He sells me a train full of gasoline. ...brilliant. A great buy. - So why don't you buy it then? - I'm broke... ...listen...I'd need a person to help me out at the customs... - Don't worry about customers old pal. ...The Bulgarians always say: "Brother, if you can't solve a problem with money... ...solve it with a lot of money.

He's the most important for me. - Good for you. You're the image of a real man. Not like me, with that scum. ...this happens ever again and I'll fuck your junkie mothers you sons of bitches!! - What you're whining about? I don't get you...Apparently you're not short on anything. - What's that to me? Tell me. ...am I successful? Yeah! I have a house as large as a castle. ...2,500 square metres. ...Take a look at the Old Man's mausoleum. Even the State would be jealous of it! - Ain't it beautiful? - Very much so. ...why are you crying, Dadan? Don't cry. - Why not? ...why shouldn't I cry? Lemme cry! - It's a wonderful castle! - It's a shame. A shame. - What's a shame? - I can't marry out my sister. That was Dad's dying wish! ...it's a disgrace! - Don't you worry, my brother. All will be well. ...But...we should close our little deal here... ...cheers. - Hello! Hello! Hello, Aksim? ...I'm in deep shit...I could do with a bit of help here... ...I've heard you have a singer who can pull a nail out of logs using her ass? - Go serve the customer. - He'll let us know if he wants something. - Then go water the pole. - What's her name? Black Obelisk? Fuck this shit, it's disconnected again. ...this fucking phone, it's killing me, it's eating my nerves! ...it's eating my whole life! ...damn it. Go water the telephone pole. I can't hear a fucking word like this over the damn phone... - May your phone die a horrible death... - Hey you. Come here. - Who? Me? - Stop pretending you're waiting for someone. I know you're after me... - I only want a lemonade. - Of course. - How many times I need to tell you to water the pole?! Get on with it! - What's up? - Go pour the water on the pole! - What a "man"...lol. - Get goin'! - Hey Aksim, I can't hear a fucking word...nothing! - What are you waiting for? - You're pouring it yet? - I can hear you now better, much, much better! ...listen! Get on the fast train and be here by tomorrow as there's a show to be done! - Hey, no lemonade for me?! - You'll get that when the geese grow a beard. Bleeeh! - Music! - My dear grandson. - I got your stuff for you. - What does the doc say? - All sorts of bollocks. I'll live to be a hundred unless the devil takes me! - And your liver? - Completely gone to pot. Useless. - You shouldn't drink that much. - What do you mean? This time I'll be getting really drunk for once! ...time for me to get wasted! - This is a hospital! Music isn't allowed here, what are you thinking?! - Doctor, you've got to make an end to this. - Imagine what it would be like if all patients left the hospital with an orchestra! - Ma'am, you really needn't be so cross! No need for it at all, no need! ...here's a bit of money for you! - Freedom!! - Excellent booze. Burns my intestines... - Grandson, I've got to tell you something. ...your mother is dead, and your father is a filthy bastard. - I sold the cement factory. - You sold it?! - Aye, that I did. It's gone now, just like if I never had it in the first place! ...check this out! ...I sold it to that dirtbag Dadan. ...your future is safe. If you need money, go to my friend... ...whom I haven't seen in 25 years. His name is... - I know. Grga Pitic. - You know of him? - You've told me about your friendship a thousand times. - A seven-foot-tall giant with hands like shovels. ...he's got two rows of teeth. ...one the regular, but the other is golden! ...elegant as a vampire. - Music... attack!! - Shoot here you asshole, shoot here! ...Here's a flowerpot! And another one. Have this too! Kill my children and family too! - What are you doing?! - Hey, leave me alone!

I'll get you! - You old monkey! - I shit on Death! - I'll get you, you're mine now, I'll smash your bloody face! "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. " - Boss, try this please, what do you think about the tase? - Our whisky is better than the real thing. - Logical. Our method is better. - Where are you, children? - We're here, grandpa. - Sit down. - That's enough, children. - You, what have you've been up to? - You know, you sent me to the fair to find a wife. - We've been to ten...twenty fairs! - And you managed to find one? - I asked something, jackass. - I can find women for entertainment or to foul around with, but good wife-to-be...that's difficult! - Be ashamed. All your friends are married and have children. ...when I was your age I had been married four times. ...it's all about taste. ...don't be fussy. Find a girl and get it over with. - Granddad, tell us about number five The one that stole your heart? ...we love listening to that story a lot. - My darling. ...even the memory of her is enough to lighten my heart. ...my little dove... - Blood doesn't turn into water. ...if you managed to find the right one for yourself, so will I! - When will that be? Are you just waiting for me to die?! - Why won't you be a good boy and marry for him. - Yesterday I had another stroke. I can barely see. - Again? - Again. - I beg you for the last time: Find yourself a wife. ...take me to the hospital to recover. ...I'll get out for your wedding. ...bring me a daughter in law. - Ok, grandad. - Kssss, cat. - Black cats are bad luck. - Take care of the passenger train, I'll take the goods train. - My lil'o train! - One... ...two, three... ...five... ...six... (inaudible) ...eighteen... - Boo! - Oh Devla! [god] - All's well? ...this calls for a celebration. Drink up! - I am scared shitless of being screwed. - I made a promise, a promise is a promise! - And money is money! Everyone got what they're after. ...I'm paranoid to think about what will happen once the train is at the customs. Hope nobody's going to screw us now! - Chill out friend! - Cheers. - Why are you hiding? ...I call the shots around here. Relax! Come! ...get in here! ...I'll keep the suitcase! - But I gave everybody their share. - Everything' okay... - That's it guys, that's all there is. - Where's the rest? - It's all, I swear on the Bible. - Brother! There must be a misunderstanding. - Thou shall die now! ...filthy rat! Don't shoot! -Bang, bang, bang!! - Shame on you. - Here's the little birdy. He's sleeping. - My suitcase! Give it back! Give it back you douche-bag!...you son of a bitch! ...rot, die! You filthy fucktard! ...stop jumping around, jackass! Stop doing this to me! Get down! ...come back down dammit! ...fuck I don't need your shoes! ...so be it! I'm coming for you! ...it is time for you and me... ...to look each other in the eye. ...just you and me. You worthless dumbass! You second class cum! ...there...finally! ...man, this is way too high. - That's Dadan, thank God! - Dadan, It's me. Matko. - The train has disappeared! - Gone?! ...didn't it cross the border? ...answer me. Where are my 17 wagons I paid for in advance? - It crossed the border 30 minutes ago. It's has to be here somewhere. - Here? Where? You don't lose track of a train. - I can't remember anything. Somebody bloody drugged me. I was asleep for only 10 minutes. - Ah come on, who would do such a thing? - He did. This cum! ...it was him. - That pig? - My Bulgarian custom officers didn't see no train. - They're lying. They're double crossing, but they will have to pay. - A train rides on track, not just randomly through the woods. ...it can't just have gone up in smoke, or can it? Boss? - No way, dammit. - My dear audience... ...after a triumphant tour in North-Africa, Asia and Australia... ...I'm proud to present to you in your quiet riverside village: The Black Obelisk. ...an act, never seen before: ...to pull a nail from a beam in the most spectacular fashion. - It wasn't an ordinary fight, but more one man against King Kong. - Which one? - What do you mean? - That big ol' chunky Bulgarian! ...I've never seen a man that big! That jerk could only pass the doorway sideways. - What's your name? - Rambo. - A warm welcome for this young man named Rambo. - Your moment has come! Hit it! - Enough! - My honoured guests... ...the great, unforgettable, breathtaking moment is near. ...a moment you'll remember throughout your life! - Bravo!! - I proposed an honest fight. I've said it: "honest fight!" ...but he kicked me in the balls. ...I grabbed him by the hair and whirled his head around. He went crazy! ...but I really paid attention not to foil our plan in front of the Customs officers... I'm good, eh? - You'll return all my money tonight. Your deadline is at 11 o'clock. ...if you don't, I'll hang you by the balls on the windmill. ...so you can get your head aired a bit... - Awful... - So how will it be? Will I have the money? - There's a bit of an issue. ...three wagons were supposed to be mine. - I've got a better plan. There's a different solution. Yesterday I bought your father's factory in the hospital. - The cement factory? - Aye. I paid him a fair price. ...ask him if you don't believe me. - But it's not enough to cover your debt. It's only two thirds. ...I have an even better plan! Much better! - You have a marriageable son. And I've got a marriageable sister. - And? - We arrange a big fat wedding and forget your debt. - I'll give you anything you want, Dadan. But that's impossible. - Why? - I'll bet on the nail. - Name? - Dadan, don't do this to me, you can't ask such as huge favour! ...your sister is 25, my son 17. - Younger men like ripe women. - That's not all, Dadan. - What else? - You know, you know. ...she looks like a little Smurf. Everyone calls her little Lady-bird. - So what? A diamond is small, but valuable. - Final bets please! Anyone? - Hands off! - Do we have a deal? Give me your hand! - No. I've got it figured now. ...I know who stole my train and drugged me. ...and who messed with my father! You stole my heritage! There's no deal! - Safet. Kazatchok. - You stole from my father! And from me too! - This way! Bit further down! - Watch! The moment of truth has come! - I love the huge ass! - I certainly don't envy your husband! - Attention! ...one, two, three... freedom! - Oi! What are you doing?! - Is this seat taken? - What do you want? - Lemonade. - Hey you. - Me? - Get me an ice cream! - I'm not an errand boy. - Come on, you're always following me around, might as well make yourself useful. - Don't you think so? - Exactly. - Out of the way! - Strawberry or vanilla? - Strawberry and vanilla. Four servings. - You're off? ...come back. ...I've got to tell you something. ...you're in a hurry or what? - Just wanted my lemonade. - Shame you're getting married. ...you're a bit young for me but rather handsome. ...I could fall in love with you... ...but there's no point when you're getting married. - Married? Who's getting married? ...I'm only thinking of you. ...you're the only reason for my presence here. - Hardly matters now... - You've been fouled. Someone's setting me up. ...I'm way too young to get married. - But you are actually engaged! ...I overheard your father and Dadan in my grandma's inn. ...they agreed last night. ...it's a shame. Here. - Woe to my head...aaargh! ...Dadan has the factory now. All gone. Whoosh! - And now he wants me too. That bastard is like highwaymen. Such a jerk. - He got the train, the factory... What else does he want? - What else? ...his mother's pussy. - The Russians are here. - The water is nice. - There's something else... ...that Dadan. - he wants to arrange a marriage to pay of my debt. - A marriage? - For our child Zare and his sister. ...The Lady-bird. - That bawler, the midget? ...that ass-plug dwarf! - We need to ask for assistance. We'll have to go and see Grga Pitic! ...he's my friend, he'll help us. - It's a bit late for that. ...he's my friend, he'll help us. - It's a bit late for that. ...Grga Pitic...is dead. - Dead? - God have mercy on his soul. I haven't had a drink yet... ...but I'll have one now for his salvation. - Grandfather. - There's my grandson. ...ain't he handsome? - Grandfather, I got you some oranges. - Now be nice and say hello. - Hello, nurse. - Have you seen her? - Who? - The girl. - No. - She's the nurse. ...they call her Candy. ...those boobies, that body. ...and that tiny butt. All so delicate. - You know for me it's love at first sight, or nothing at all. - Love at first sight? Ridiculous. - The son of your deceased friend Zarija dropped by. ...he came for help. ...all his money has been stolen. ...can we settle this, together with Little Grga? ...we'll skin them alive, and pump them full of lead. - Nah, I first want to see the grave of Zarija. - As you will, granddad. ...it was only a proposition. - Nobody listens to me. I'm talking to you! - Miss! Please! - I'm not getting married this way. - Shame on you. - Miss, let me take measurements please! - You're my greatest enemy. ...you're no brother to me. You're a tyrant! - Must our parents curse me from their grave? - No, no no and no!! I don't want to marry. ...I'm not getting married. Do you hear me? ...I am not doing it! Not even if you kill me. I'll wait for my true love! - 168. - Who is it? ...tell me. Who is it? The true love? - I've seen him in my dreams. I'll find him one day. ...I saw him a hundred times in my dreams. I know what he looks like. ...I know his eyes, his face, his lips. ...He's big, very big... - Neck measurements...13... - Which big man would want you, stupid goose? ...an ass-plug like yourself? - You'll see, he'll come one day! - Breast, 88. - Shut up! Leave me alone. - Safet. ...cool her down. - Leave me be!! - Stop arguing with me in my own home! - Let me go! I'll marry the man I love, whether you agree or not! - Pull. - Aaaaye, my little sister! ...what are you doing? Our father is looking down upon us! - Changed your mind yet? ...I'll turn you into a garden gnome! ...son of a....go on. - I don't want to! I'll marry the man I love! - Do you even have a soul? Our parents are watching from above. - They can't see shit, it's cloudy! - Party! - Come on! Party I said! - That's great Dadan, good luck to you! - Move over, let the lady sit. - Congratulations. - Do you want something to drink? - Coffee. - Only coffee? - Only coffee. - You need any help? - Ask Matko, that dumbass. ...make sure there's food, I don't trust him. - The one who looks like a vampire and the monkey face are both married. ...so only the little one is left. ...the poor Lady-bird - That midget? - Yes, in her bridal gown. ...all yours, take her! - Never. - I'm here for business. - What business, Sujka? - You marry my Ida. ...I see she pleases you. - You won't find a prettier girl in the whole region. ...I fed her from her birth. ...we've been everywhere. ...gave her medicines to make her beautiful. ...to buy her Italian clothes... ...we went to Rome and Napels. - Liar. ...I showed her all countries. ...in the end we went to Sweden. - I know. To beg. - Still better to beg than to scavenge in the rubbish. - That's what you did! - Do you have anything against it? - How much do you want for her? - Give me 35,000 marks. - Grandma. - 15,000, in two installations. - What do you think I am? - 17,000 in three parts? - Give it in one installation. ...and I don't want see you ever again. - She's selling you like cattle. - Never. - Carry me. ...come on, carry me! ...you're really handsome you know. ..and now...kiss me. - Damn tie. ...save me, grandpa. Don't let me be married. ...I'll drink his blood. - Where you're off to? ...let go of that! - I'll kill him! - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Give it to me! - Let it go! You should be ashamed of yourself! ...Relax. Keep your cool! - Look at this. Watch. - I'll teach him. - I know what I have to do. - I don't want to. - Listen. ...Listen, listen, let me tell you something! ...her brother Dadan... is a common war criminal. ...he almost killed me. He'll exterminate our family. He'll drink our blood. - But she's a midget. - O mirror, the dead with the dead... - He'll be drinking out blood! - ...the living with the living, the children with their father. - For two months. Then you get a divorce. - Still no! - ...the dead with the dead... - I said no and that's it! ...leave me be! - I'll prevent the marriage in an elegant manner. - Zare. - Help me climb up or else I'll beat you up! - Zare! ...damn you stupid kid! - Where is he? - Who? - Your grandson. - Aye, you keep sitting here and playing! ...don't even be bothered by Dadan making mince meat out of all of us. - Where is my son? - I don't know. Couldn't care less. - Where is he? - I don't know. - Get out of there. ...out!

The day he marries... - Grandpa wanted to saved me... ...we'll flee together after the mourning ends. I'll take you with me. Just you and I. - Ah now I'll need to get a new costume, shoes, a butterfly-tie... ...wreaths of flowers, candles...and so on... - It's ok... - Definitively dead. - It's okay...cry... - Ah it's you, Matko, you womaniser. ...you're early. Eight o'clock, you said. ...where's the son in law? - I need to speak with you immediately! ...it's urgent. I've got to talk to you in private. - Hope it's not bad news! Today I only want to hear good news. - I'm listening. - My father is dead. - Really? - Really. - My condolences. - What can I do? ...a wedding and a funeral don't get along well. - You're right. How about he dies in three days? - Three days? But he died this morning. - Who says so? Who knows? - I know it. Zare... ...I came straight to you to tell you! We'll have to mourn for forty days. - I'll mourn with you... in three days. ...you're a wise man. ...you're not postponing the wedding. - We'll have to! - You're mad? Should my father turn in his grave? That's what you want? - Of course not Dadan. - Don't tell anyone about the old man. ...it doesn't matter to him if he dies on Wednesday or Friday. ...death's forever. ...it doesn't matter when it begins. ...did you hear anything? - Nope. - We didn't hear anything. - No. - Me neither. ...get the guests and come pick up the bride. - As you like, Dadan. - Cheers. - He's not impressed. - What? - Even if he kills us and places us dead at the dinner table, the wedding will continue! - I won't do. No way. - Don't be daft. He'll rip my head off! ...take this... ...for your soul, daddy. ...take his legs. We are going to the attic. ...turn him aside. ...bring up some ice. ...hurry up! ...quick! ...don't do this to me. You don't need money anymore. ...put his legs on the chair. - Get the grandchildren of Grga Pitic here! - I left six messages. They don't answer. ...who knows where they are? ...daddy, forgive me. - Hold it above the bride. - I don't want to. - Hold it above her head. - I said no! - Get away you. - Take the child, it will bring you luck. - My dear ones...This is the most beautiful day... ...of your whole life. ...a unique day... ...to say so. ...because this is the day of your lives. ...answer now in front of the witnesses... ...the following questions. ...but be brief.
