[birds chirping] [music playing] [horn music] [TYPING AND VOICES IN BACKGROUND] [MUSIC - MIKE AND THE MECHANICS, "OVER MY SHOULDER"] MIKE AND THE MECHANICS [SINGING]: Yeah. Looking back over my shoulder, Ican see that look in your eyes. I never dreamed it could be over. I never wanted to say goodbye. Looking back over myshoulder with an aching deep in my heart. I wish we were starting over. Oh, instead of drifting so far apart. Everybody told me you were leaving. Funny I should be the last to know. Baby, please tell me that I'm dreaming. I just never want to let you go. Looking back over my shoulder, Ican see that look in your eyes. Turning my heart over and over. What? Nine pounds. I put it here. [car engine] [horn music] LORNA: Or was it here? IAN: So can I use themachine for half an hour? You can't put anything downin this house for five minutes. Can Chas and me have the car this evening? So it's all right if I use the machine? No, I haven't finished with it. So can Chas and me have the car? LORNA: No. And don't say why can't you have the car. Why can't we? Because we haven't renewed the insurance. I have got an interviewfirst thing in the morning. So why don't we renew the insurance? Because we haven't any money. So why can't Chas stay the night, then? Practice in your room! [horn music] If you made the supper, I couldbe finishing with the machine! If you're making thesupper, I can use the machine. Can't hear! I said why can't he stay? LORNA: Do something, will you? Vegetables. Broccoli, in the freezer. I said if you're making the supper-- don't play that thing on the stairs.We can't hear ourselves think. LORNA: I put it aside, for I'vegot to buy new disks tomorrow. Then I could be using the machine. JESSICA: And don't say Mark's [inaudible] because he wasn't out there at parent's day! Where is it? It's my money.- Mum, don't get hysterical. That's it. Out of my way. I can't get to anything. I can't do anything. Everyone's always in the way. You're always getting hysterical about money. Because if I don't have new disks, I can't work. If I don't work, we can't eat.Get away from that! I haven't finished with it. [door bell] Why is everyone always in here all the time? JESSICA: Because it's the living room. It's where everybody lives. There's somebody at the door. Look, just everyone go away. Calm down. [horn music] LORNA: You are not goingto play that thing in here. Get out. She complains if I stay in my room. That's because you lie inbed till 4:00 in the afternoon. Mum, it's my year off. LORNA: Oh, Jessica. If I hear that one more time,I will walk out of this house and never come back. [horn music] I struggle and struggleto keep this place going. JESSICA: I can't even doas I like on my year off! LORNA: And no support from anyone! Lorna, will you stop shouting? And if you don't want topractice in your bedroom? Because it sounds better on the stairs. Then leave home and find a house of your own to practice in! Shouting doesn't help. It just makes everything worse. Don't you shout at me then![door slam] And don't slam doors! [door slam] Why don't you all grow up? [door slam] Also there's someone at the door. I'll go. I'll go! And he's not staying, soget that absolutely straight. I can't have any more people in this house. Oh. Hello. LORNA: And don't tell him he can come to supper because he can't! JESSICA: It's not Chas. LORNA: He had supper here lastnight and the night before. He's moving in. I'm sorry, but I am not having it. Hello. JESSICA: I told you. Remember me? Yes. Jamie. Right. I was just passing, so-- Come in. I was really going to say hello and then-- Drink or something? Five minutes. Well. 20 years. Is it? Well, more than. And this is your-- - Daughter. - Daughter? Well. LORNA: Jessica. [horn] And Mark, my son. Son! My god. So. Well. Unbelievable. Kiss, yes? Lovely as ever. Lovely as ever. Oh, hello. I'm Jamie. Jamie Rivers. I used to be in love with your wife. I thought you were inlove with Nicola Hepworth. This is Ian. Yeah, hello, Ian. I was, then with you. No. Then with Mary someone. Very briefly. We were at university together. I don't remember you, do I? No. Anyway. Rolls Royce. Long as Chas doesn't turn up and pinch it. You really haven't changed at all. Has she? I've kept all your stories, your poems. I've got them in a file somewhere. So what can I offer you? Nothing. Oh, some mineral water. You know, Nicola gave me your address. I ran into her outside the Savoy. IAN: Yeah. There's no mineral water, I'm afraid. Tomato juice, tonic water, anything. I'm not staying.Supposed to be down the coast. There are people there with a boat. I thought I might pop over to France. So, uh-- I think there might be some orange squash in the refrigerator. Wonderful. Oh. It's terrific to see you again. Sit down, anyway. Ah. You still writing, then? LORNA: Not really. JAMIE: I've always expected tosee you in the bestseller list. I haven't missed anything, have I? No. And you? Well, you know what the city's been like. Up, down. LORNA: And up again. Money's not everything, Lorna. Go and help Daddy find theorange squash, will you, love? Why can't he find it himself? So grown up children. How about you? No. No, no. Not married? Married? Yes. Married. Married all right. Help Daddy. Please. No, not everything at all, Lorna. Money. Not by any means. Oh, you are, though, Lorna. Lovely as ever? You are! Oh, good. You look a bit-- a little bit tired. Well, yes. Well, I haven't sleptmuch these last few weeks. Why? What's the matter? JAMIE: Nothing. You know, just, uh, things. So? What brings you here? Lorna, this is ridiculous. This is the silliest thing I'veever had to say in my life. I've left my wallet at home. I know, but the beeper went and no petrol. I felt in my pocket, no wallet. No cash, no credit cards, nothing. 7 o'clock, the banks are shut. Then I saw a sign, WestByfleet, and I thought, hold on. There's somethingfamiliar about that name. [laughing] I know. I know. I know. After 20 years, oh god. It-- though it isactually great to see you. No, it is. It is, really, Lorna. I-- I-- I was in love with you, you know. You never noticed. So how much? Well, uh, even 50 quidwould be a tremendous help, or 25, or-- or 10? What? You're short as well. Jamie, how much do you actually need? About 17 million. There it is. Nine pounds. I couldn't find it. Nine? I mean, if you could spare it. Oh, Lorna. Saved my life. You have to stay to dinner first. Well, that's very sweet of you, Lorna, but-- Oh, go on. We never see anyone these days. After dinner. Yes? Sit down. It's a change for you, too. No one knows you're here. No one's going to bother you. [music playing] Someone's finished the orange squash. So long as you're not thinkingof inviting him to dinner. Don't worry. I'll do it. Mum. Oh. Never had me consulted about this. Can't have my friends to supper, so why is it all right for you? Anyway, I thought youwanted to use the machine. I realize I'm just a passenger at the moment, but I should like to know when we have other passengers joining us. So why is it all right for you to have people? Because he's rich, you moron. JESSICA: He's not going togive it to us, though, is he? Moron. He might, Mum plays her cards right. What, buy you a new horn. No, no. We'll not get started on that particular subject. No, but what's a coupleof thousand pounds to him? Mum's rich lover can buy usall presents to shut us up. [beep] Nothing I can do? I shouldn't think so. Very peaceful here. Is it. Yes. Had a rather hectic few weeks. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. You're not a writer, are you, Ian? Not of poems or stories, I'm afraid. Just job applications. Sorry. No, I simply wondered. There's a slight rush, you see, because I've just been informed I've got an interview in the morning. You may wonder why havingan interview in the morning means there's a rush to write out applications for five more jobs tonight. No. No, no, no. Well, I'll tell you all the same. It's to give me something totake my mind off it tomorrow. I mean, off sitting there doing an interview for a job I know perfectlywell I'm not going to get. Hm. Anyway, if he's stayingto supper, then so is Chas. - No, he's not. - Why not? - Shush. - Why not? Because this is different. Because you see Chas everyday, and this is someone I haven't seen for 20 years. When you haven't seen Chas for20 years, then yes, all right, he can stay to supper. Until then. Oh, sorry. I was just wondering-- sorry. I was asleep. I don't know what time it is, only he said sort of five minutes. And I was just sort of wondering if-- Hold on. Mark! Which one is it? JESSICA: No idea. Mark! What? Julie? No. Yuckier still. Just get rid of herbefore supper, all right? Also, he doesn't steal cars. Chas doesn't steal cars. Mark just said that! How many times? You keep your voice down! GEORGINA: Oh. Didn't he come in here? I thought he came in here. Sort of jagged and things. It's for him. I was in the car. I was asleep. You want Jamie? I don't really know where this is. West Byfleet. Oh. Right. I was telling him the story of my life. His lady friend's here. Yeah? Sorry about that. He's asleep. Asleep? I don't know whether to wake him. GEORGINA: Actually, he--he was asleep in the car. I woke up somewhere. We were on the wrong side of the road, and there were all these carscoming straight towards us. [nervous laughter] Right. What's happening? Your friend's here. Hm. Here! The door step. What was he like? Thick man, dark glasses? Jamie, what's going on? - Just tell me. - It's not a him. It's a her. - Her! LORNA: Yes. - Oh, god. No, no, no. Not her! Not her! No, no! Ah. You. Sorry. Only you said five minutes. Ah, right. Uh-- right. No. No, I woke up and I thought,uh, uh, oof, bad dreams. Bad dreams. Oh. Right, this is an old friend of mine, Lorna. Lorna, this is Georgina,another old friend of mine. And this is-- LORNA: Ian. JAMIE: Ian. Listen, Lorna's invited us to dinner. Oh. Right. Do you mind? I mean, two of us? Of course. Lovely. JAMIE: Right. Some stuff in the car I'd better bring in. Where the key? The key? Hey! Out of there. What we looking at? 50K? 55? Why, making an offer? Locking it for you. Oh, really? Leave your key in round here? Yes. Very kind of you. Friend of Mum's. 50,000 quid and it's sittingthere with a key in it. She says stay to supper. Why not? [music playing] JAMIE: I'll tell you how you make money, Chas. You take risks. IAN: With other people's money. I don't mind taking risks. Well, if you don't mind taking risks, Chas, because you think it'll never happen. Let me tell you something. It may happen. May happen. Sometimes it does happen. You take your money, hm? All you've got. Nine pounds. Nine million pounds. You lay it on the table, and if you lose-- You find some fool to lend you some more. CHAS: You put it back on the table. Not just your money, Chas. Your home, your life. I'm talking about the big game. Where's the real moneyhappening these days, hm? I'll tell you. Eastern Europe. Big out there, Chas. Very big. Big game, big players. All the multinationals moving in, the old party bosses with their millions tucked away in Switzerland. The old secret police, the mafia. Not just one mafia. I'm talking about a dozen different mafias. You get in the middle of that lot, Chas, and you might wish you weresitting right back here again. Well, I hope you'retaking all this in, Mark. What? It's a free master class in high finance. Georgina's fascinated. - No. I was just wondering, is there a phone here? Quieter in the bedroom, though. JESSICA: You could buy anew French horn for Mark. They cost 2,000 pounds. - Hm. Right. What? Oh, for god's sake. So? Jessica. He said! LORNA: But not on the stairs. His practice. Yes, Chas. You earn whatever you can lay your hands on. Believe me. GEORGINA: [giggling] But I kept falling asleep,and he kept falling asleep, and it was absolutely horrendous! The one with the [inaudible]. Gosh. Anyway, we were driving on theroad somewhere and I woke up, there were all these carscoming straight towards us. JESSICA: Come in here, showingoff about how rich he is, and Mum sucking up to himand giving [inaudible]. CHAS: 50,000 pounds worth of motor, baby. Bit of money and everyone goes mad. [clattering] They're not staying, by any chance? You haven't asked them to stay? Going. They're going. He's just washing up. [horn music] That? That's just his-- I don't know. [dishes clanking] [car engine] [horn music] [clank] [humming and horn music] Haven't done this for about 20 years, either. I'm sorry. We can't afford to get the dishwasher repaired. No! It's wonderful. You know, doing things. Getting my hands under things.- Not the scratcher. Not-- not that one. Hm? You know, being out of my life for a bit. You know? Being in someone else's life. [horn music] I've got to get up at 5:00. Go to bed, then. I thought you said Chas wasn't to have supper. I thought we said Chas wasn't to have supper. He's not staying the night. No one's staying the night! Honestly. [horn music] I should have got married,settled down, had children. You know, done something real. Yes. Well, if you knew what it was actually like. I heard you all. I was standing on the doorstep. It was so-- I don't know. So real. Well. I'm going to have to say goodnight. Hm. Up at the crack. Well, good luck with the, um, whatever it is. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Well, if you're ever passing this way again. Yes! In another 20 years. [laughing] Nice man. Anyway, I thought you did get married. Yes. I should have married someone like you. Never too late. Who do you know who's like me? No one. No one. Only you. Oh. Sad. Yes. GEORGINA: Hold up. It's here. West Byfleet, wherever that is. Oak Way, West Byfleet. I know. So creepy. And the wife person keeps gazing at him, like, oh, darling, you've come back to me after all these years. And the husband person's furious. And there's a kind of son personwho plays the French horn. No! Plays it. Plays it. And then he's got this kind of sister person who goes out with this really gorg guy. Anyway, I just wish we could go. Walk out? I can't walk out. I'm stuck here. I haven't got any money with me. Anyway, it's out in, youknow, the suburbs somewhere. They don't have taxis in the suburbs, do they? No. I'm upstairs in this bedroomplace, and it's so sinister. It's full of like wardrobesand things, and mirrors, and you know, strange spooky suburban things. I can't explain, but it's likeone of those films you see where people disappear into the house and they're never seenagain, because there are all these weird people, you know, kind of sawing them up and haulingthem down or something. It's all pretty sad, actually, isn't it? What? Life. Sad? No Haven't had time to think about it. How about happy? Have you had time to thinkabout whether you're happy? No. No, you haven't, or no, you're not? Bit more washing up, perhaps. You've got your children. Yes. JAMIE: Your husband. Yep. JAMIE: No? Yes. Yes. And you've got-- what's her name? Georgina? I guess. - Oh, Jamie. Come on. JAMIE: She's just a friend, Lorna. Oh, I see. JAMIE: She is! You know, she's just someone-- you know. Right. So. Let's get on with it. That's what we do, is it? Just get on with it. [music playing] GEORGINA: [giggling] Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! I'm missing everything. What? GEORGINA: What did she saywhen you said-- you know? Oh, no. I don't believe I'm missing all this. It's absolutely typical. So what did you say? You didn't. And what did he say? [knocking] Sorry. You want to-- - No, no. I'll just clear the-- Oh, no. And she said you'dactually, you know, said. Sorry. Just get them off the bed for you. Sorry. No, sorry, it's just someone, you know. What? She said? Well, you mean kind of he said, she said. Don't move. Don't move. What? I just want the, uh-- - Listen, I'll call you back.- No. No, the letter. The letter. What? No, no. Sorry. Sorry. Stay, please. I was just clearing the bed for you. Easy, you guys. Easy. What? Never you mind. IAN: I was simply clearing the bed. What? Get on with your practice. Sorry. Practice, my son. Practice. Yes. Well. I'm going to bed. You remember the bucket of ice cream? No. Yes, you do. It was on the roof of the law library, and it melted in the sun. So you poured it over somewretched man underneath. Simon Hillary. He's dead. He died last year. Delayed shock. [laughing] Sorry. You better go. Yeah. [music playing] Jamie. Don't worry. Two minutes, and I'll be gone. No. No. JAMIE: What? Your friend. Ian. Two minutes, Lorna. Sorry. Sorry. Right. Uh, nine pounds. There you go. Here. Can you go, please, before anything else gets knocked over? [water running] Remember me? Thank you so much. Lovely time. Barbados? What? Friend of mine's got an estatethere, separate guest bungalow. You could be entirely on your own. - I can hold all. - You could work there. You could write. You could-- you could bring Ian. Bring-- bring the children. LORNA: Got the money? And as soon as I've been to the bank, Lorna. Goodbye. I'll be in touch. The car. I was in love with you, Lorna. All that last term. Oh, get in. Get in. So Barbados, yes? Yes, yes. Off you go. Goodbye. It was here. I left it here. [clank] The car? Where is it? Oh, no. Oh. Lorna. Lorna, hold on. Lorna, please. Jessica. Lorna, wait. Where's Chas? Mum! Oh, you're here. Good. Fine. They like me! I told you. Sorry. I just thought before we rang the police. There's a phone in here. - What are you doing? - Oh, sorry. Because he used to, Chas. I know that. He told Mark. [interposing voices] You're not going to report it? Lorna, I-- I don't think it was stolen. I think it was just sort of taken by some people I've had dealings with. You mean repossessed? Something like that. - It was an on hire purchase.- Sort of. And it was the company's car. Me, the company, completelydifferent things. Yes, well, you told me. 17 million pounds. You thought I was joking. Not really. And your wallet? Wallet? Wallet! Oh, yes, wallet. Here. Well, there's nothing in it, though. I mean, no cash, nocredit cards, no nothing. No, this is all I've got left. Nine pounds. Nine pounds, 54. And the nine pounds are yours. It's cash flow, Lorna. It's all a question of cash flow. You are owed money, you borrowagainst what you're owed. They must have been following me. I'll make up the sofa. What is it in here? Nothing. All I've got left in life. A few mementos. Funny how things work out. Anyway, tomorrow you'll be on a boat. Yes. If I can just get across the channel, I've got friends there. Places to go. Go to the ferry, go on thetrain like everybody else? Hm, not really. You're not wanted? No, no, no. Not-- not wanted, no. I'll get the bedclothes. Now what? Nothing. Go back to sleep. What are you looking for? Your old literary works? They have gone? Go on. See you tomorrow. They don't mind if I stay. Yes, they would. Go on! Bedclothes? LORNA: Thought you might want a nightdress. OK. Wicked. [door slam] All right? Thank you. Lovely. Sorry. I mean, you know, all this. No, no. I'm sorry. I mean, this friend of mine, she knows him, only she had to go off to her martial arts. So I got sort of left with him. And he said he was desperate to get away. And I said, well, I know thesepeople who have got a boat. And he said, right. I've got my car outside. Oh, I see. When was this? About half past 4:00. Today? It all just kind of suddenly happened. Right. I'll make up the sofa thing.- Oh, I've got-- Sit down. Insurance claims. You're typing out insurance claims. You realize there's just thisone wee sofa thing to sleep on. Nothing to do with me, of course. Don't worry. We'll sort something out. Jamie-- no, not that one! Sorry, but don't use that one.It's blocked. I should have said. Oh, sorry. We're waiting for the man.Sorry. There's just upstairs. Sorry. Sorry. But the stories, Lorna. What happened to the stories? Never mind the stories. Listen, in the morning-- We'll walk. We'll hitchhike. But the stories you used to write! Hadn't you better gohome and sort things out? Home? What home? The car, that was my home. Been living in that car for the past six weeks. Living in it, sleeping in it, working in it. Everything I possess was in that car. Suits, files. That is literally all I have left in the world. But Lorna, love, at university-- LORNA: At university. At university. What has that got to do with anything now? [water running] I knew you were spying! Oh, sorry. Thought you were Mark. Sorry. JESSICA: There's no key. Mark did something with it. [door slam] You want to get in here? - No, no. - You're Mark. Mark? - No. JESSICA: Mark! MARK: Mark, Mark. Why don't you have speech therapy? Oh, sorry. Sorry. I was just-- I thought you'd gone. No. Sorry. All right? Fine. MARK: They went. They came back. Dad knows about this, does he? Comic taste in women, your friend. I-- I don't mean you. I mean the other one. What was her name? You can switch the lights on. I'm not asleep. Mind you, she's got apretty comic taste in men. Well, no. I could see his charms. It's not all just money. I don't know why you're sulking. Anyway, I apologize. I don't know what for. Oh, for your ending up beingstuck with me, I suppose. Anyway, let's get some sleep. JAMIE: You can see it all so clearly when you look back, all the little things, how they all added up. You didn't think about it when it happened. You did this, you did that. But all the time, it was adding up. Adding up like a long column of figures. Then suddenly, there you are. It's all totaled up. And that's your life. That's you. What? The bed. All yours. No. I was just listening to seeif the bathroom was empty. [music playing] What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? I'm creeping off to meet someold girlfriend in the loo. MARK: Won't be long. Oh. Listen, I've got to get up at 5:00. MARK: I'll be slower if you just stand there. Always hanging aroundoutside of people's doors. What's that supposed to mean? Huh? MARK: I'm not coming outwhile you're standing there? For God's sake. Pathetic, creeping aboutlike some dirty old man. GEORGINA: Oh. Sorry. I was just trying to find,you know, the bathroom. The bathroom? You don't want a cup of coffee or anything? Well, not really. No. OK. I just thought since you're here. Sorry. Sorry. You want the bathroom. It's in there. Oh! In there! Right. Thank you. I mean, if you want a cupof coffee or anything later-- [door slam] Hey, come in. Come in. Don't worry about me. Sorry. Sorry. He's out. I don't believe it. Hey, come in. Whole family, why not? He's here. I was just dropping off. In the bathroom in his underpants. Ian, listen. You told him he could stay. Just be calm for a minute. - I thought we agreed. - Listen! Doesn't anything mean anything anymore? Listen to what I am saying! Now-- But it doesn't matter whatyou're saying because it doesn't mean anything. [toilet flushing] LORNA: He can't go tonight. IAN: But you said-- LORNA: Keep your voice down. IAN: What, he might hear me? Bugger Chas is here. LORNA: He can't go tonight. IAN: He is going tonight! LORNA: Because he hasn't got a car to go in! IAN: He hasn't got a car to go in, he can walk. Walk! How can he walk? How can he walk? On his own two feet. With my boot right behind him. [crash] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was trying to find some aspirin. I didn't realize.I though-- so, you're here. I'm, you know, sorry. Only-- No, fine. Good. Your feet. The glass. I'll clear it up. I'll do it. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. [music playing] You've cut yourself. Doesn't matter. Wait. Wait. What? Stop the bleeding. [slurping] LORNA: Don't do anything silly. GEORGINA: Sorry. Aspirin. I was looking for some aspirin. Sorry. Leave it. I'll get the dust pan. Broken glass in her knee, I thought. Possibly. Haven't swallowed it? There are various things I could say. There are various things I could say. But I won't because when I getback tomorrow, they'll be gone. And we'll say them then. [music playing] JAMIE: [snoring] [dog barking] Want a boiled egg? [yawn] Sorry. I'll ask him. She says do you want, you know, a boiled egg. I'll do it! Did, um, Ian get off all right? Didn't hear him. God, I had my best night's sleep in ages. I'm, uh, improving thespelling a bit as I go along. I hope that's right. LORNA: So you'll take our car? Right. Thanks. I can't drive you myself. Haven't got the insurance. JAMIE: Really? Then she could drive it straight back. [yawn] LORNA: You're not messingaround with that thing, are you? Little surprise. [beep] Jamie. That's our one source of income. I was just doing a few of the-- what happened? [car engine] It's not quite what you're used to. You will look after it, won't you? Lorna, I am so sorry. I-- I just really hope you should get back with it before Ian discovers. I thought there might be some files still somewhere on the disk. Get in, get in. And I haven't forgotten about the nine pounds. Good. I'll see you out. I feel terrible, rushing off like this. [whirring] [tires squealing] Reverse. Where's reverse. You're insured, aren't you? Lorna. [car engine] Come on. Come on. Ironic, though, isn't it? You know, Lorna, you spend yourlife keying in other people's insurance claims. [dramatic music] What's the matter? Back. Back. Back, back. Lift it. Come on, you're blocking the road. [car engine] [crash] [glass breaking] I said back! [car engine] [crash] [windshield wipers squeaking] JAMIE: Sorry. Your brakes. Did they see me? Jamie. Perhaps we should call a taxi. Those two men sitting in the car. Did they see me? What happened? Crash! Then-- Crash. Oh, no. You OK? But insurance. I thought you said-- Where's Dad? Sorry. Sorry. JESSICA: What happened? - Jamie? GEORGINA: I don't know. Something crashed. Then crash! Don't worry about all this. I'll take care of all this. Those two men sitting in the car. They're the ones who took yours? No, no, no. These are the other ones. Other on-- what-- what other ones? That's the hooch she rang last night. She rang Kika. Kika must have said somethingto-- of course it's them. - They-- they want this? - This? No. They want me. - What do you mean? - I mean they're armed. I mean they're killers. Don't be silly. JAMIE: Lorna, I know these people. Lorna. Lorna. Mum, what's going on? Where's the Roller? What's happened? Can I help you? Excuse me. Are you looking for someone? Look, I'm sorry. There'd be complications. They're armed. You said they're armed. Yes, but phone the police and your name comes up on their computer. Jamie. Look, don't worry. They won't come in here. Mum. Out. Out. We're talking. What? They'll have the back ofthe house covered as well. [train engine] So what is it, Jamie? Drugs? Not as far as I know. Pension funds? Oh, Lorna. If only I could lay my hands on a pension fund. [music playing] [glass crunching] You haven't hurt anyone. You haven't murdered your nanny. I haven't done anything. It's just money. It's business. It's a technicality. It's a-- it's a-- what? Ah. He-- he looks a bit-- Yes. Um, I'd better explain. I'll do the explaining. Stay here. This almighty crash! She goes, what's that? We come running down the stairs-- CHAS: And crash! JESSICA: Crash again! I said, my god. Where's the roller? I said, Mum, what's happening? We'll go in the kitchen. Oh, sorry.
