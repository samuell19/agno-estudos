(intense orchestral music) (Jim screaming) (dark foreboding music) (water burbling) About six months ago, Jim Wheatley went south of the American continent to search for a cave known as Cueva Muerte, the Cave of the Dead. He didn't return. We're recalling this story because today there was a new development in this six month old mystery. Today at International Airport, wealthy broker Dan Matthews arrived home from his second trip in search of the young explorer. In this filmed interview, Mr. Matthews tells what he found. This time I was able to trace Jim's travels to the shores of the Caribbean. I also ran across some evidence indicating that this so-called Cave of the Dead actually exists. I think Jim found that cave and he's still there conceivably still alive. I think I can find that cave, least I intend to try. Well all we can add to that is we don't wanna go along.

(rhythmic Calypso music) About the trip? Yeah. Pete, no. Why not? Dan's not gonna throw me out. Besides, I'd like to meet them. You know, walk and all. Pete. Pete, hasn't it been bad enough for you? Don't make it worse. Don't force them to turn you down in public. Don't make it worse for yourself. I want you to listen to this song just as I heard it in the little cafe on the shores of the Caribbean. And afterwards, I want you to hear the meaning of the song interpreted by an Indian that I brought here for that purpose. And then there was rays in the area where legend is located, the Cave of Death. 'Course I may be grasping at straws, but that's why I wanted your opinion. (rhythmic Calypso music) Well Pete, it's been a long time. Yeah, yeah. How are you, Dan? Listen, you're gonna need some help on this trip of yours and I'd like to go along. I wish you could. Anyway, I'd like you to meet these men. Dr. Willoughby of the museum, you remember Peter Morgan? Peter Morgan? That's a name all of us used to know. And the traveller and lecturer, Mr. Trainer. We've never met, but I remember Peter Morgan. All of us remember. Oh. Yeah, thanks very much for the remembrance. Well c'mon out on the terrace, all of you. (rhythmic Calypso music) Sit down please. Please do. Sit down, Pete. Well doctor, Mr. Trainer, find yourself a seat. Now Sir Lancelot is goin' to sing us a song, apparently a normal Calypso song. But there's something behind the words if you listen closely enough. All right, Sir Lancelot.

And now the young Indian who's goin' to interpret the meaning of the song for us: Raoul Koom. Right up there, Raoul. Come on. Tell us what the song means. I think it is better for me, for you, For all of you if I do not. This is what I brought you up here for. I'm sorry. Sorry. You know where that cave is, Raoul? No cave, just a song. Maybe, but I want you to take me to your village. What are you afraid of? There's no cave and I can't find it. No, Mr. Matthews, 1 believe you're right. It's possible that such a cave does exist. I've never heard that song before, but I know something about tribes from that area. I've never associated their idea of a purgatory with an actual cave, yet most superstitions have some basis in fact. Doctor, maybe that's why you never found an altar. We didn't look in the cave. Possible. He's referring to the fact that these natives make, let's say used to make human sacrifices to the god of death. We often wondered where their altars were. An altar in a cave. It's possible. You know anything about that, Raoul? Just take me to the village. That's all. I take you. Good. Well don't think I'm not concerned about Raoul. It's just that I'm more concerned about Gina's brother. When you start interfering with native superstitions, you better be concerned about yourself. You're not going down there alone, are you? Well my plans aren't completed yet. Nobody should ever go down the cave alone. Any cave. You need professional help, Dan. You know anybody better qualified? Hmm? No. Except for one thing: That leg still bothers you quite a bit, doesn't it? Yeah, it does. Why? I think you gentlemen should know something. Mr. Morgan's accident was my fault. We were in a cave together and through my inexperience, we got caught in a slide. Mr. Morgan saved my life but at considerable cost to himself. You didn't have to say that now, did you? We'll talk about it later, Pete. All right. I'll wait for you in there, 'kay? (soft sombre music) Pete. Hmm? You're not being very fair to Dan. He wants to help you, you know that. Yeah? How, by sendin' me more money so I can send it back to him? I know how hard it's been for you to accept help. He wants to be your friend and so do I. Look, Gina. I don't care about- - I didn't turn from you, you know. You turned from me, from both of us. All I want is to help find your brother and prove I can still do the work I know best. Dan owes me that. No, no. I'm sorry. Forget that part of it. See, you need me on this trip. You both do. But you need my experience. I think you're right, Pete. We do need you, both of us. We want you to come along. Thanks for volunteering. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thanks, Dan. Fine, well I guess that's all the information you can give us because I guess that's all you'll know when you got there. Now if you'll just start walking toward the plane please. Turn that thing off first. Cut it, Ted. Mr. Morgan, we'd like to get this story complete, the facts just as they are. You've got enough. Can't use that much film anyway. We can if you don't come back. (camera whirring) (dark adventurous music) (soft tribal music) [Dan] Is that your village, Raoul? Yes, that is my village. (soft tribal music) Juanita, Juanita! (hens clucking) Well Raoul, you're home. Don't you wanna get out and see your friends? (villagers chattering in foreign language) Who recognises (indistinct)? Didn't they sing these things before? (villager speaking in foreign language) (dark tribal music) (speaks in foreign language) Raoul Koom. (villager speaking in foreign language) Americano, doctor that way. American doctor. That sounds good to me. Let's get over there. What about Raoul? I'll get him. (dark tribal music) Raoul? Raoul? Raoul Koom? All right, where is he? Hmm? Where's Raoul Koom? Pete. Pete, come back. We better talk to that doctor before we start anything. Fine. (dark tribal music) (soft adventurous music) (soft foreboding music) (knuckles knocking) [Dr. Ramsey] Come in. (soft foreboding music) Where are you? [Dr. Ramsey] In the kitchen. C'mon in. Hello. Americans here, why? Well we we're looking for the doctor. I'm Dr. Ramsey. Oh, the natives can't cook. I like fruit so I can it myself. Dr. Ramsey, my name's Matthews. This is my wife. [Both] How do you do? And Mr. Morgan. Doctor. We ran into a little trouble down in the village. We have an Indian with us. His name is Raoul Koom. Raoul Koom? I know him. When we arrived there and he got outta the car and well just disappeared. We're afraid that something might've happened to him. Can you help us? Lino, look into it. What are you doing here in this tropical backwash? Well we're looking for a young American named Jim Wheatley. Came down here about six months ago to explore a cave. Nobody came here six months ago. Nobody ever comes here. Well how long have you been here, Doc? Oh, 15 years. Forever. To explore what? Cave. There's no cave around here. Well we hear there is. It's one of the natives talk about. Cueva Muerte? Oh. That one. You lookin' for the Cueva Muerte? Yes. I can show you how to find that. That's their purgatory. (dark orchestral music) You go this way. (fire crackling) So I came here. Thank you. A research man works where he finds his materials. No thank you. Materials? Telephydic plants, fungi, bacteria, the slime moulds. We need them for the development of antibiotics. And here I've been able to overcome an annoying time factor. I found a remarkable fungus that reproduces by binary fission so rapidly under ideal conditions you can actually see it grow. Well? Raoul Koom go. He visit, he go. But why would he just suddenly vanish? Raoul Koom was in trouble. I want to know what happened and I want to know why. No trouble. He visit, he go. Lino's a good boy. He wouldn't lie. No Indian would lie to the man with the big magic. (taps) I saved him from smallpox. Oh, I merely inoculated him, but I did it with the mumbo jumbo they like. Since then, I've been treated like a spiritual king and I like it. Makes my work easier. Doctor. Doctor, those names recognised our cave gear. How do you explain that? Your imagination. They're just simple, friendly natives unless you stir them up. Isn't it true that these simple, friendly natives make human sacrifices on the altar of their god of death? Yes, they do that. And isn't that altar in a cave? No, it's out in the jungle. But I've made some changes in that ceremony too. Since I defeated the god of death, I now outrank him. So when I hear the drums start the death ritual, I go claim the victim and send the poor soul away to a safe place. And everybody's happy. Only one I didn't send away. Concha? I know you're there, come in. (soft romantic music) This is Concha, my wife. Hello Concha. Now that's a pretty dress. Oh, you like? I show you, yeah? Okay. Well it looks better on you. (soft romantic music) You cripple? Yeah. Concha cripple once too. It go away. It go away? No. He no show now. It no show now. Concha, go start dinner. These people are gonna stay a few days. I no see it again. Friends no see it. (soft tribal drumming) What's happening? You no like food? Oh, it's just that I'm not very hungry right now. Do you suppose we could have some of Dr. Ramsey's canned fruit? No. I don't think the doctor would mind. You want some fruit? Yeah. (soft tribal drumming) Well Doctor, what is it? Drums. Thanks very much. I don't know what it is yet. I told you these people could be dangerous if you stir them up. (soft tribal drumming) (glass shattering) Stupid. Pete. Pete, stop him. (hand slapping) (Concha shrieking) Leave her alone. This is my wife, my home! I don't like to see people hurt. Please, it is right. I drop jar. It's my fault. I asked her to get the fruit. Let me clean it up. Get away from it! (fruit fizzing) What's the matter? It's nothing. It's spoiled. There's mold all over it. [Concha] I pick wrong jar. I canned this food especially for the fungus. I told you I work with all kinds of fungi. [Lino] Dr. Ramsey. (soft tribal drumming) Let's get back to that village and find out what's going on. You coming? No. Why not? Let's just say I don't like to walk. (soft romantic music) (soft tribal drumming) (thunder crackling) (wind whistling) [Gina] Dan? It's all right. (soft tribal drumming) (wind whistling) These are for you. Take them. You see? We're your friends. We're friends of Raoul Koom. Where is he? (wind whistling) (thunder crackling) Go away. (soft tribal drumming) Where's Raoul Koom? Go away! Not 'til I find that cave. You know where it is. Show us. You know money, American money? I'll give $200 to find that cave. to anybody, to you. Will you show us? (soft tribal drumming) (thunder crackling) (wind howling) (thunder rumbling) Raoul Koom. Raoul Koom. (Vocalises) His tongue. (Gasps) (dark orchestral music) So the question is are the Indians lying to Ramsey or is Ramsey lying to us? You know, for a man who claims he's got so much power, he was pretty scared when he ran outta here. Maybe he doesn't outrank the god of death any longer, huh? Pete? We go now, yes? Before he come back? Yeah. That's my dress. Oh, I took the Liberty of giving it to her in return for a favour. Concha's gonna take me to where I can hear the voices. Aren't you? Voices? Yeah. How far is it? Not far. You better stay here. You probably had enough for one night. Dan, you wanna come? You didn't answer Gina. What voices? Voices of the souls in purgatory. (soft soothing music) (Gina whispering) (soft serene music) (waves crashing) This the place? So where do the voices come from? (soft orchestral music) Are they really voices? Could they be some other sound? How often do you hear 'em, Concha? Sometimes. You wait, you hear. Maybe minute, maybe hour. Maybe no voices tonight. (dark orchestral music) (thunder crackling) (thunder crackling) Dr. Ramsey? Lino? (dark orchestral music) (door rattling) Oh, Dan. Pete. (twigs snapping) (leaves rustling) (Gina shrieking) Well maybe we better get back. - Oh. - Yeah. Wait. (dark moaning) (dark foreboding music) Maybe it didn't come from under the ground. What do you think? You mean can I explain it? No. Dan? Dan! Pete! (intense orchestral music) Dan! Dan, Pete! (dark moaning) (Gina shrieking) (arrows whooshing) (dark foreboding music) (Gina gasping) (Gina breathing heavily) (Peter grunting) Dan? Dan! Dan, look over there. (dark orchestral music) (wind howling) (Gina weeping) (thumping shoe) (soft intriguing music) (wind howling) Lino! Take it easy. It's all right. We have a collar. I bring your knife. Yeah, so I see. That's Jim's knife. It has his initials on it. I gave it to him. Knife prove Lino tell truth. About what? I take young man to cave. He lose knife. Well? I take you to cave tonight, now for $200. Where's the cave? Not far. Must go now. Indians sleep. I have horses outside. No. What about Gina? She's safe here. Indians no come here. Well one of 'em came here. He no come back ever. You can't go into the cave at night. It's always night under the ground. We've gotta go sometime, Gina. This may be our only chance. All right. (wind howling) Must hurry. We're about ready. Just one more thing. (soft romantic music) Pete. Concha, Lino's gonna take Mr. Matthews and me to the cave. No. Please no go. Well we have to go. I was wondering if you would look after Gina, make sure she's all right. Pete, you know it is wrong for you to go there. You are no fool. You know it is wrong. Yeah, maybe. Gina be all right. Thank you. (soft romantic music) (soft adventurous music) (horse whinnying) Well where is it, Lino? Back of bushes. (horse whinnying) (intense orchestral music) (thunder crackling) Or it could be bad underground. Not raining yet. Go, hurry. You stay here. (dark orchestral music) You stay here. I'll look. (dark foreboding music) All right, bring the gear. Now watch it. (dark orchestral music) (water dripping) And Ramsey didn't know about their altar. Didn't he? (dark foreboding music) Looks like it might be a little rough. There's no bottom. There's always a bottom. Just depends on how deep it is. Take this. (dark foreboding music) (water dripping) All right. Drop it. (torch thudding) Think there's about 200 feet. (Dan whistling) Well we can make it all right. Just take all our ladder, that's all. Well I'll set for Pete's (speaks faintly). All right. (soft foreboding music) Ready? Go ahead. I'll use the safety sling. Now those rungs are close to the wall and they're slippery so use the overlocking step. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) All right, pull the belay off. Belay is off. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) You all right? Yeah. Take a look at this. That. Been here a long time. Not all of 'em. (dark foreboding music) Well let's go. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) (water burbling) Looks like the passage continues on the other side. Yeah, we can make it all right. Lemme take your rope. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) (water burbling) Now look where you're goin'. Don't look down. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) Big rock. How's your leg? I asked for this, didn't I? (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) Pretty big place, isn't it? Yeah. Why don't you look down there? How 'bout this way? (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) Not enough here looks like that'd help me. See anything? No. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) Pete, come here. You think that's Jim's? That's the kind he carried. Looks like there was an opening here too. It's covered by a slide. You think Jim's still inside? I hope we'll find out. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) (thunder crackling) (rain pattering) (soft tribal drumming) Dr. Ramsey, they've got to be warned. They can be trapped by a flash flood underground. I can only repeat: I don't know where the cave is. Then find Lino. I looked everywhere. - Well couldn't you- - All right! I'll look again. Thank you. (soft tribal drumming) (rain pattering) Concha, what is it? What are they doing? They go crazy. The angry gods bring song. No go out! You can do nothin' and I make promise you stay. (soft tribal drumming) (rain pattering) (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) All right, c'mon out. I'm gonna go in first. You stay here 'til I tell you to follow. - Pete. - Huh? Now look, you're in charge. No arguments. A man can't be second all the time, not when he was second choice with his wife. I want Gina to know that I went in first. All right. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) [Peter] Dan, you all right? Yeah. (dark foreboding music) (water rushing) Hey Dan, get outta there. There's water out here. There's water in here too. Rocks are covered with some kinda growth. (dark foreboding music) (water rushing) Hey Dan, get outta here! Come on! (dark moaning) Pete! Pete! Dan! Dan! (intense foreboding music) (water rushing) Dan. (thunder crackling) (rain pattering) (soft tribal drumming) (thunder crackling) Oh thank God. Where's Dan? (Peter breathing heavily) (Peter coughing) Where's Dan? Huh? He's trapped. Is he alive? (breathes heavily) I don't know. What happened? Well we found this squeeze hole that leads into a big cavern. Dan went in. There was a flash flood. Whole opening's covered with water. (thunder crackling) (rain pattering) He went in alone? Yeah. He said he wanted to go in first. (Breathes heavily) Listen, I need the diving gear. And I could use some help, Ramsey. I'd be no help. Well what about some of these Indians? No. No Indian go in that cave. There's one who will: Lino. Lino. He came back and he'll do what I tell him. He's strong. All right, get him. I'm going with you. No, you're not. - Pete. - I told you it was flooded. You've been in enough caves to know what that means. I can't stay up here while he's down there. I've got to go with you. (soft tribal drumming) (rain pattering) All right. (thunder crackling) What are those? It's diving equipment and Gurney cams. We're dragging it through narrow places. Still raining? It stopped, but it can start again. Is he all right? He's scared, but he does what he's told. Don't you, Lino? Well why'd you run out on us and take our horses with you? I thought you would be in cave more long. I would've brought horses back in morning. Uh-huh, what's in the pack? Food, tools for digging. All right. Go get the horses. Take one of these with you. Ready, Pete? Yeah. Oh, those Indians. Think they'll try to stop us? Not now. They no stop you going into cave. Let's go. Go ahead. (soft romantic music) (dark foreboding music) (waves crashing) All right. Let's go. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) The water's gone down. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) You all right? Is this it? Yeah. Path has been covered over, but we can clear it easy enough. Come on gimme a hand, Lino. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) Throw it on. I don't know what we're gonna find in there, but it could be bad. I know. I'll go through first. You come next. Gina, I want you to come last. Now that clear? I'll take my gear with me and the torch. (soft foreboding music) If anything happens, don't come after me. Get outta here and get plenty of help before you come back. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) I got the rope. Dan? (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) You ready back there? Ready. You better get your pack, Lino. I'll take it. You go next. No, he said that you should go second. No, you go. All right. (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) I said Lino was to come first. He wouldn't. (soft foreboding music) (dynamite fizzing) Get outta here! Come on! (explosion bursting) (rocks crumbling) No! (soft foreboding music) (Gina coughing) There's not much chance about getting out of here, is there? Not the same way we came in. But maybe Dr. Ramsey, he'll send help. Ramsey sent Lino. This is the cavern we heard those voices, isn't it? Isn't it? Pete. - Pete, what's in here? - Gina. What's happening in here? Where's Dan? - Gina! - What happened to Jim? I'm sorry. We'll find out. C'mon. (soft foreboding music) Gina? What? Dan. Dan. It's Gina. Can't. Get out. Dan, we've come back for you. No, get out. Jim? Jim's dead. Pete? Pete, get her away from here. They're all over. They tried to kill me. Who? They're not human. Who? They're not human! (intense foreboding music) (creature growling) (Gina shrieking) (creature shouting) (water splashing) (water burbling) (dark moaning) (soft foreboding music) (water dripping) Gina, that man was all covered with fungus. It was the same kinda stuff you found on those jars in Ramsey's kitchen. What? This cave's been filled with it. You remember Ramsey said he claimed human sacrifices and then sent 'em away? Well this is where he sends 'em to experiment on. Oh no. Pete. Pete, it's moving. - It's alive. - Go away. (soft foreboding music) (dark growling) Gina, wait a minute. You remember the one that chased you? Well he couldn't have gotten out the same way we came down here. There's gotta be another entrance. Where? Where? - The same way that fungus is coming in: Ramsey's house. Look! Gina, that's the way out. What about Dan? I don't know. I think his back is broken. It might kill him to move him. We've got to get Ramsey to stop that fungus and then come back for Dan. I can't go without Dan. Light all these torches. They'll protect you for awhile. Here. (soft foreboding music) (fungus spurting) I'll be back. (intense foreboding music) (creature growling) (fungus spurting) (rod banging) Open the door! (rod banging) Ramsey! Open this door! Open it, Ramsey! (glass shattering) Now you stop that stuff or I'll kill ya. Spreads like fire. Nothing can stop it, except the simplest thing in the world: Fresh air. But you've already stopped it. When you broke that door, you killed it. It's still growing! (soft foreboding music) (fungus spurting) [Dr. Ramsey] It's developed an immunity. Now the air won't kill it. But somethin's gotta stop it. - What? - Nothing. We can't let it out because we'll seal it in this cave, otherwise it'll destroy the world. There's explosives in that tunnel wall. I'll set them off in my lab. Wait a minute, my friends are in there! Get them out first! There's no time. Even a little bit of this stuff gets out, nothing will stop it. Nothing. You take one more step instead of help me, I'll split your skull. Concha, you know how to set off the explosives in that tunnel? Yes. - Hurry. - No, you'll do it! I'm gonna stay here and so is Ramsey. That must be another way outta there. Pete, no. Set it off. Set off the charge! (Peter grunting) Go ahead! (dark foreboding music) (fungus spurting) Wait a minute, this whole lot would come down on us any minute now. (dark foreboding music) (fungus spurting) (explosion bursting) (cave crumbling) (fungus spurting) (Peter coughing) (intense foreboding music) (fungus burbling) Pete. Pete. Dan. Dan, it's Pete. Pete. It can't be stopped, can it? No. No, but at least it's sealed in here forever. So are we sealed in here? Dan. Dan! (soft sombre music) (dark foreboding music) (fungus burbling) (Gina weeping) Gina. Gina, we've got to go. (Gina weeping) (dark foreboding music) (fungus burbling) Sit down here. That water may lead into the ocean. I don't know, but it's worth a chance. Anything. (dark foreboding music) Your boots. Better start unlacing 'em. (fungus spurting) All set? Yeah, you ready? (dark foreboding music) (fungus spurting) (water burbling) (victorious orchestral music) (Gina breathing heavily) (Peter coughing) (waves crashing)
