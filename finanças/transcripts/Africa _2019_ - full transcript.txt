There's Maya We've just gathered some wood. And we have a guest. This is the second one who came to visit us. He just came to visit us. He's helping us cut down the trees. I'll try to focus on him. I don't want to block the view. I guess he left the herd. Maybe he got lost? I think he looks calm. Walks around freely, doing whatever he wants. What an animal... So beautiful. So much strength. The depth... the depth of? The depth of the night... The moon, the stars... The depth of the night... I'll wear it as a cloak. A cloak... a robe? A garment... A cover? I will wear the depth of night as a cloak. "I will wear the depth of night as a cloak." Five and four. What letters do you have? I don't have any. Nothing? No. Okay, five and four? Five and four, yes. I'll wear as a cloak? Yes. As a cover? A vest? No... A coat? Honey, do you think we should hang the alligator up here? Here. Hand it to me, please. How does it look? The bottom right corner a little lower. A little more. Great. That's it, I think. Right? Yeah, fine. Hello? Hi! How are you? Wow, the ceremony became quite a story this year, don't you think? We're singing three songs instead of five. And they don't want us to sing the anthem. Yes, Uri had to go speak to them. They didn't update us at all. In the preproduction meeting Uri was very determined that we sing Who are you talking to? One sec, honey... He said it's important that we sing and that that's what our community is all about... Yes! We were in Namibia, not Kenya. Namibia, yeah... Hi Haim, what's going on? Hi Meir, what's up? Dog took you out? Yeah, I needed to pee. At our age it's harder to hold it in. Did you hear anything about the preproduction meeting? What meeting? For the ceremony. Oh, at the community center. Yeah, I saw a gathering over there. Who was there? I saw some teenagers doing stuff. Didn't you get the memo? Ronit probably emailed it to me. I didn't see it, I'll talk to her. Okay, see you later. Bye, Meir. Bye Tsila. Hi Ronit. Hi Meir, how are you? I'm fine. I heard you had a meeting About the ceremony production. That's right. Well I didn't get the email. Why would you get one? What do you mean? I always take part in these meetings. It's my responsibility. Make sure you keep me updated next time. Oh, we took it off your hands. What do you mean, "took it off my hands"? We passed on the responsibility to the youth. Give me a hand here. To the youth? Yeah, the education committee decided. Have you lost your mind? That's too much responsibility! It's not building the Roman empire, you know... What are you talking about? Who came up with this stupid idea? The education committee wanted to challenge them. And who will take the responsibility for constructions, electricity? What the hell? Look, these are great kids. Come in and see for yourself. Just tie the dog outside. I don't want it in the office. These boys are well organized, they've got it all under control. Tsila, stay. Come have a look. Here. Dates, duties, working plan. Who are these brats? They are very organized. But what do they know about electricity and construction? So maybe you'll be their mentor? No way. I won't take part in this nonsense. Tom, you dumbass. What do you want, man? Wanna switch with me? It's really hard. You're fucking lazy that's your problem. What an idiot. Hello? Hello, Gidi? Hey Meir, how are you? I'm fine. Did you hear they gave some teenagers control over the construction of the ceremony? Yes, Ronli from the council decided on it. How can the council just make that decision? I've been doing it for the last thirty years. And who the hell is Ronli anyways? She just moved here. What does she know? Why don't you do it with them? I'll do it by myself or I won't do it at all. Honey? Honey? What? Hadas is here with the kids. Alright. Are you coming? Yes, yes. Okay, do me a favor, don't come into the clinic, okay? So you won't get mud inside. Fine. Grandpa! Grandpa! I saw the blue lion! Come on! Let's go find it! I see a small tail over there. It might be the blue lion. What do we do? I have a plan. Look. We are here... We need to sail up the river until here. Where we'll reach the red forest. We need to get all the way down to the end, okay? Then we get to the waterfalls... But we need to watch out from the beast! Row! Row! I'm rowing. I'm rowing! That's it! I'm rowing. I'm rowing! We got to the red forest. Drop the anchor. Dropped it. Let's walk carefully... Stop! I think I heard the beast! Where? Over there! Over there! Over there! Go, grandpa! You're winning! You're winning! You can do it, grandpa, you can take her! You're winning! Will you interview the grandparents as well? And siblings... Guli is getting huge, I can barely pick him up. He doesn't fit into his bed anymore. We need to buy him a new one at IKEA. Buy? Yes. Why buy? What do you mean "why buy"? I can make one. No need, dad, leave it. It'll be easier if we just bought one in IKEA. I made one for Alon didn't I? That was a long time ago. He was his age, more or less. Yeah, so? Alon told me what kind of bed he wanted. And now I'll ask Gul what he wants. There's no need, dad. No need...I know there's "no need". I'll ask him what he wants. Enough, don't argue with me about this, okay? Okay, we'll see. We need to go. We're late for the movie, Zach. Bye. Bye, mom. Bye. Have a safe trip. Maya, could you stop playing please? I'm in the middle of something here. Are you working on the ceremony production? No. Why? I decided to pass this year. Why? Hadas asked me to build a new bed for Guli, So I want to focus on that. Fine. I'm going down to work. I have a patient coming. So if you're going to the workshop don't go through the clinic. Alright, alright. (On our way back home, we didn't say a word.) (We were both silent. I was so embarrassed he had seen me crying...) (I looked out of the car window and counted the street lights.) (Did he react when he saw you crying?) (He must have noticed, but said nothing...) Tsila, come. (Radio) Good evening. Come here. Come here. Uri, I don't have patience for you. Uri, you little turd! It has to be straight. Ron, people are supposed to stand on it. People could die here! Uri, either help out or leave. Nemet, Nemet! Leg first, then the plate. Leg first! You better listen to the man Put it here, like this, okay. Leave her alone. We're just playing. Leave her alone. We're just playing. Leave her alone! (Shai US mobile) Hey, Shiko. How are you? I'm okay, how about you? I'm fine, just about to head out. I have a meeting. The one I told you about. With the investors you told me about? We're going to present the app. Oh, who's that? You've got a new employee for your workshop. Wow, check out those tools! Adam! What's that? It's a saw! Adam! Adam! Look over here. It's grandpa! It's grandpa! Do you want to see Tsila? There she is. It's Tsila. Did you see her? Say "Tsila". Tsila. Tsila. Yes, there's Tsila. That's right! So, tell me... What's that? Shai? Shai? I can't...I can't hear you, Shai. I'm losing you. Shai? Shit... What happened? Some rats ate the cables. I can hear them running around, I'm telling you! Can you go down to the fuse box? Yes. "The wind often changes course..." "We tried to leave, yet I know" "We'll stay one year after another" "The sun draws lines in your room, strips of light..." Maya, is there any hot water left? "I gather for you every morning..." "The small details, the small joys of an ordinary day..." "Will you answer me?" "Next to the bills" "Bills" means cash. "...and won't compromise" "Bills" means cash. Four letters. Oh look, Oren posted something on Facebook. Maybe it's "stubborn"... "A concept: " "A new app for finding potential life partners" "...After matching, the apps develop relationships between themselves..." What? Let me see that. "...The apps marry each other, get divorced, and spare us the inconvenience... Who's up for the challenge?" That boy... What the hell? He is nuts! He just posted it. It's probably this ‘Tinder' thing. He got his creativity from you, dear. What did you feel before you fell down? I couldn't breathe. I couldn't hold my body up. Did you feel pressure in your chest? A little bit. Were you getting enough rest? Yeah, I guess. Okay, Meir: as you can see, in this area where we had our last procedure, the artery is narrow and the blood flow isn't normal. Things aren't going as well as I'd hoped they would. But I wouldn't run and do another catheterization just yet. I'll write you down some more "Cardilock". Now, in order to prevent another procedure you must rest and avoid stress. You'll need another checkup in two weeks. Is the 15th okay? The 16th? The 16th works. Didn't you get stressed in Africa? Weren't you chased by a Siberian tiger or something? He tried, but I bit him. I see. So you didn't have any stressful episodes there? No. I felt terrific. Hello? Hi honey, how are you? How was it at Dr. Dascello's? Fine, he feels well. Come on...What did he say? Nothing, just a routine check up. He didn't talk about any changes? New medication? Anything? No. Okay, fine. When you come home do me a favor and come in quietly because I'm starting a session. No problem. Okay, bye. Bye. The car I understand, but me too? Forty shekels. Forty. Including the rims and a tip? Not including anything. Nothing, Meir. Everything is an extra fee. Magnesium, whatever you want. By the way, you know that tomorrow we're on patrol, right? I'll come pick you up. Okay, bye. Bye, Meir. Hey, come here. Tsila, come here. Where's the ball? Go fetch! No. Come here. Dad? Catch it! Orenke, be a bit more quiet. Mom's in the middle of a session. How are you? Fine. How are you? Alright. Dad, do we have any decorative lights by any chance? We do, which ones? I'm having a housewarming party. I need the colorful ones. Or are those white ones? I'll get you both. Where? In the workshop. Come, come. They're here. Is this it? Let me. There we go. They're the colorful ones or the white ones? Both. Great, thanks. Wait, where are you going? I'm heading out. Oren, wait a second. I want you to help me with something. Is it urgent? Nothing is urgent but if you can, help me a little. Hold it. Let go of your phone, Oren! What? Tell me what to do. Hold it steady. I am holding it. No, you are not holding it right. Bring it a bit further down... Keep it parallel to the edge. Hold it tight, Oren! I don't understand what you want... Just make sure it's on the same spot. Alright, are you holding it? Yeah. Hold tight. Don't let go. That hurts! Hold on. Let me do it. Stop it, don't be a baby. Give me a sec, I can see it. Dad, it hurts! No, it doesn't. I'm telling you that it does. One sec. Just leave it. It'll go away on its own. Let's start on the video. Do you want me to film you now? What? The video you asked for. Now? What about right here? With the books in the background? It's messy. We'll organize it. It'll be good with the books in the background. But all these pictures... What's that got to do with it? It's too much. How about here? With the curtain? But you can see the bed. You'll sit on the bed and I'll make sure they can't see it. It looks good. There's a nice symmetry with the curtains and the wood. Okay. Can you sit here? I wanna see it. Okay. It looks alright. So let's do it. Just make sure I'm in the middle of the frame. I'll position you. Can you direct me? Sure. Okay. Wait a second. Alright you can start now. Dear Zeev, upon your 60th birthday Maya and I wish you... It sounds like an electronic birthday card... Talk freely. Zeevik! Smile, smile! Zeevik we've known each other for 40 years now. We went to the same college. We went together to the army, to unit "8200" And sports activities! We went to the same country club and played tennis together... Dad, don't give him his biography. Straight from the heart. He's your friend. Like I'm talking to you? Like you are Zeevik? Sure. Zeevik! My God, you're 60 years old! I can't believe it! Let me tell you, this is the best age. It's a fresh start with no obligations... The kids are married, you have grandkids. You're free to do whatever you want now! We went to Kyrgystan together We can do a whole bunch of other stuff... (Oren'ke!) One sec. What'd you say, mom? (Can you help me for a minute?) Erez just came over and told me that he wanted to relinquish his gun. I said that we should do a transfer of ownership. Dad, I'm taking the grapes. I took the gun... What kind of gun? Thanks. Sure. This Butchie Rocky... Oren, are you moving to the US like your brother? I wish. Go make films in Hollywood! In Bollywood... Stay in Israel, the films here are great! Things are going great over here. Oren, did you take the eggplants? No, it's ok, thanks. Anyway, we needed to transfer the ownership of the gun. So I took the gun to the firing range... Oh, the whole story... It was. You need to make an appointment two and a half months in advance. At the Ministry of the Interior. Exactly. So they told me you can go to a different city... Meir? Meir, is this for sale? Do you want it? I really want it for my office, it's gorgeous. I can't give that one away, but I can make something similar for you. I'll tell you about it later. Okay. "Laugh on, laugh on at all the dreams" "I tell thee as I see" "Laugh on, I still believe in man" "For I still believe in thee." "Laugh on, I still believe in man" "For I still believe in thee." "My soul still longs for freedom" "Unbartered and unsold" "I still have faith in the fate of man" "In his spirit fierce and bold." "I still have faith in the fate of man" "In his spirit fierce and bold." Do you need anything? I told the tiger... Can I have more? It's not enough. Look at Maya. Now she is there by herself but she keeps on climbing. They are going down. She is on her own, well done. A little more, Maya, just a little more. Don't give up. I feel... like I'm... like I'm stuck in this place of not knowing. I've been here for...how long? Six months? We started talking about Rani, and how... You know, he's my partner And I'm at an age where I need to settle down and decide. And there's something I just can't decide on. Whatever you choose, it doesn't matter what you choose As long as you make that decision with your eyes open. And you take all the various considerations... Considerations into account and not out of fear I think it will be the right path... (Maya?) Again, I'm not telling you to choose A or B. (Maya?) I think that it's important that you won't choose out of fear. (Maya?) I'm really sorry, I apologize. (Maya?) What happened? Where are my planks? What happened? Where are my planks? They were here by the workshop. Meir I'm in the middle of a session! Meir, later. I'm so sorry. It's alright. No, it's not alright. Sorry. You were saying? What's the matter with you? You barged into my session! All the planks I left behind the workshop disappeared. Fine, we'll look for them. But I was in the middle of a session! Your patients are running around my garden. Oh, come on! I'm going to get some new planks. Meir... I'm going to get some new planks! Leave it, it's fine. No, no, no. Maya, leave it, it's fine. No, you are not picking this up by yourself. Watch the step. Hold on...slowly. Careful here. I'll end up falling because of you. I didn't understand what ended up happening at Dr. Descallo's? Didn't he talk to you about changing your medication? He didn't say anything about the Cardilock? No, he didn't. But did he check your blood pressure? He said that everything is fine. Did you tell him what you're feeling? No, it's all fine. Fine, next time I'm going with you. There are some small screws over there. Where? There's a bag over there with small screws. Yes, if you can bring that to me. Thank you. These ones? Yes. Maya, what are you doing? I'm cleaning. Maya, you're smudging the glue. Let me do it by myself. Are you sure? Yes, thank you. Fine. Make it tighter. I don't want to hurt you. Pass it through here. Fine. I just don't want to hurt you. It doesn't hurt, I'm fine. Whoa, hold on. I'll hold it. So wait. You have blood stains on your pants. Take them off, I'll go wash them. I'll wash them, soon. Ugh, this bandaid. Does it hurt? It's fine. Okay give them to me, I'll wash them. The rats made it all the way here. Oh boy. Do you know where the mousetrap and the rat poison are? Yeah, on the top shelf over there. In a red bag. "A sound made by an IRS employee on the plane." Three and four. "Teva" crashed. "Teva" crashed? Three and four...? No, I'm reading the news. Tsila, where's the cat?! Tsila, where's the cat?! Enough, enough. Okay, okay. Take her outside. Hello? Hi Judith. Yes, tonight. Hold on, I'll ask Meir. One second. Honey, it's Judith on the phone and she wants to know at what time to come over. Is eight alright? Yes, sure. But at 8.30 I'm on security patrol with Haim. Sorry, Judith. Stop it. Okay. So maybe we'll start earlier. This is the cheetah farm. There were tame cheetahs inside. Wow... And they took us there in this truck and then... Is that the first course? ...They're half tamed. No, they gave What do you mean half tamed? I mean...it's still a wild animal. Even though she's trained and gets food there, the owners told us That there's nothing to be afraid of? That you won't be eaten? So was it scary or not? I don't know... It wasn't scary. They did warn us they liked hats. That's right, and one girl who sat there, leaning against the wall Wow! How nice! No, this is already in the wild. She's jumping for tourists, unfortunately. They throw the meat and she jumps up to get it Ah, it was meat. What a beautiful animal! Then we saw a family with a few cubs Everyone is trying to get a picture of that moment. It's very arid over there. Those rhinos were like that for three hours There was a log there There was a log that Meir really liked to look at Because he said "He's really getting off on it." Well he was probably just rubbing his horn against it to sharpen it. Meir? Meir really enjoyed that whole log situation. The animals are so organized. It's amazing to see how they all drink together, in groups, one by one. And then, when the elephants arrive, there is something... They show them respect. And I don't know if you remember this, but in ‘The Jungle Book' Bagira tells Mowgli that they're the kings of the jungle. And it's totally true! The first time you hear them crack the branches it's quite unsettling, because you realize how strong they are. Goodnight everyone. I need to be on patrol. Bye! Bye, Meir! Say hello to Haim for me. Sounds like they have ‘elephant skin'. Haim! Haim! Haim, Haim, we need to go. What? We need to go on patrol. We still got time Meir, 10 more minutes! We need to leave. Come and join us! Haim... Meir, when will you join dancing class? It's just... What are you getting out of it? It's packed with easy girls! They are all served on a silver platter. I don't know, man... you're married. You're also married, so what? My marriage is going down the drain. You and your health stuff... It's great for the heart! That's not my kind of thing. Meir, what's going on with the annual ceremony? I can't work with these people anymore! I told them to leave me alone and let the kids handle it... I'd rather focus on more productive things. Yes. They'll be chasing me down for help later. You're right. Once they realize what's going on, they'll come begging... Stop one sec. I wanna have a smoke. Meir, I hear footsteps. Right by the pipeline down there. Hello? Hello? Who's there? Is there anyone out there? It's nothing. Maybe a wild boar. A wild boar eh? Yes. Well, I can't see shit anyway. How is Maya? She's fine. She's showing our pictures from Africa to some friends. Remember I told you? You still owe me a story or two. You said it was an amazing experience. It really feels like you're part of nature. It's a feeling I can't describe. Man...sounds awesome. We bought a CD there, great music. Check it out. Hey Meir! What's up? Please lower the volume down. It's a lot of noise and the neighbors complained. Ziv! Turn the volume down! Good night. Meir, what's wrong? Meir, all good? What are these planks of wood doing here? Oh, we found those yesterday. Where did you get these? What do you care? Who brought these here? We found them yesterday in the woods. Do you think stealing private property is funny? I'm telling you we found them yesterday. Shut up! No one asked you. Who the fuck do you think you are? Tom, calm down! Shut up before I slap you! I saw him watching me and Ella making out the other night. I bet he jerked off hard. That's why he has that bandage on... Meir, are you crazy?! That motherfucker! You old motherfucker! Calm down! Meir, I hope we are not in trouble. Tom, calm down! You old fuck! What's the matter? We'll kick his ass... Calm down, calm him down. Everything's alright now. Shut up before I slap you! I saw him watching me and Ella making out the other night I bet he jerked off hard... That motherfucker! You old motherfucker! Alright. Goodnight. Honey, what's going on? Nothing's going on. Honey, we have to talk about this. Why? Because these are our neighbors and Tom is their son... So what? These are people from our community. We just hiked with them together on the Israeli National Trail. Okay. And they might call the police! Oh, really? I'll fix that pothead a criminal record so fast... That's irrelevant... You know I have connections with the cops. That's great but... He should have gotten that slap years ago! That's not the point... Will you leave it then? No, we have to take care of this! Do you want a criminal record... Maya! Don't you want to talk to me? Talk to me. It's obvious you're going through something. Would you rather speak to someone else? You speak to someone else. What have I got to do with him? Come on, I'm serious. All I'm saying is that if you got to a point... You want to send me to therapy now? If you've reached a point where you slapped a kid, then something isn't right. Maya, you know I don't believe in this nonsense. Come on! Don't get offended now... Maya... Honey, wake up, it's getting late. Tsila, come on. Gilad, I've got an idea. Take the blanket and put it over her. It'll be awesome. Shit, there is a stain here. Grandpa, Tsila smells weird. Yeah, honey, she smells. Grandpa, when are we going to look for the blue lion? I'm just preparing the ship right now. It'll be ready soon. Get in the bathtub. Alon, Gul. Let's go, we're late for rehearsal. Mom? I'm coming. Honey? Yeah? I left you a list of things at Shmulik's. We need all kinds of stuff. Meat, butter cookies. Could you bring the cookies to our rehearsals? I'm going with Hadassi and the kids. Yeah, yeah. Okay, thanks. Shmulik! What's with the cheese? You promised you'd get me the one that has only five percent fat. It's all fatty cheeses here, you know I don't eat those. What's up with that? Meir, I heard there were some problems with the teens? Everything's fine. Did it work out? People are talking about it. Everything's fine. [Check one two, hi...one, hi, can you hear me? Hi...] What's he doing here? I don't know. [Can you hear me?] Maya.. Oh, great, honey! And leave the meat to defrost, alright? Cut it, I'll prepare it later. [Can you hear me? Hi, hi] Grandpa, do you remember that I'm interviewing you today for my family tree essay? Yes. Look the old fuck is looking for trouble. He's got some balls showing his face around here. [Hi...can you hear me?] Come on, Tsila. Maya, did you see the bearing? What's a bearing? The one I made to turn the wheel of Guli's bed. Honey, I can't hear a word I'm in the middle of rehearsals. Okay, thanks. What have you done, you stupid dog?! Drop it! Drop it! Drop it! What have you done, you stupid dog?! "Meeting, hardly meeting" "one quick glance" "fragments of obscure words" "no more." "once again, waves of happiness and sorrow" "sweep over everything and rage" "The dam of oblivion I had built in my defense, As if it had never been." "I kneel on the shore of the roaring sea" "and drink my fill." "I kneel on the shore of the roaring sea" "and drink my fill." "Meeting, hardly meeting" "one quick glance" "fragments of obscure words" "no more." Shoshi, can you come a bit forward please? Sure. I want you to have a little solo part here. Tsila. Tsila? Tsila? Tsila get up. Get up! Tsila? Hi, grandpa. What's up? Hi. What's wrong with Tsila? She's not feeling well. Do you remember we're doing the Interview today? Today? For my "Family tree" school project? I forgot. Where do you wanna do it? We can do it in grandma's clinic. Can I start? Yeah. I'll ask questions and you give short answers because grandfathers only get one page I can do two pages but I'd rather not. When's your birthday? April 14th, 1948 Same year our country was born. What were you like as a kid? Crazy. I would break into people's homes. Shoplift food and drinks. Stuff like that. And Karol, my brother, would snitch on me. He did it to protect me.. That's enough. What were your favorite things as a kid? Climbing trees... Stuff like that. I liked dancing but my mother wouldn't let me. She was afraid I'd turn out gay. I don't see what that has to do with it. What was your childhood dream? There was a time I wanted to be a sailor. To sail the seas. And to find the "Blue Lion". What are your parents' names? And what is their age? My mother's name is Aneta. My father's name is Lika. They passed away... My mom passed away ten years ago. And my father, he was about my age. Twenty years ago. Did you fall in love as a teenager? Not really... here and there, you know. The only woman I truly loved was your grandma. Okay Did you fight in any wars? And if you did, which ones? I did. The War of Attrition, Yom Kippur, Lebanon, And some other operations. Can you tell about one event you remember from that time? Yes, mostly from the Yom Kippur War. At the time, I fought as a commander in the Golan Heights. Many of my soldiers were killed and wounded. People who haven't been to war have no idea what it's like. Okay. What do you do today? I don't work anymore. I'm retired so I can do whatever I want. I have my workshop and I like to make things. Like that bed I made you. Now I'm making a bed for your brother, Guli. But it's different than yours. And that's about it, I'm... What are your plans for the future? More or less the same... Alright, I'm done. What do you mean? It was very short... That's all I needed. I gotta go. Where are you going? I'm going to prepare for tomorrow's ceremony. I washed two shirts for you for the ceremony tomorrow. I ironed the white one with the buttons. And also the blue one with the collar you like. I'll wear the blue one. Okay. I just hope we'll sing like normal people tomorrow. Hopefully we won't screw up. I keep forgetting the words and so does half the choir. Did you talk to Tom's parents? I'll talk to them tomorrow, I'll get it done. I took Tsila to the vet earlier today. Why? What happened? The lamb I wanted to make... Yeah? She got it down and ate it all. I punished her and locked her in the shelter. I forgot I put rat poison in there. She ate it and I found her passed out. I don't know what's gotten into me... I almost killed her. Don't blame yourself, honey. She'll be fine. I hope so. (Meir speaks Arabic) Where did that come from? Tsila eating the meat reminds me of something I learned in Arabic years ago. Why? What does it mean? A dog walks into a butcher shop and steals a piece of meat. Runs into a river and sees his reflection in the water. He jumps on his own reflection, and drowns. It reminded me of the dog stealing the meat... I'm not sure where that came from. I'm tired. Did you work on Guli's bed? Yes, I painted it. So is it done? Yes, pretty much. And when will you show it to him? Tomorrow before the ceremony, I think. He will be so excited. It came out... Just like in the movies. I'm in pain. Maybe we'll go somewhere? Where? Somewhere far away in Africa. A place we haven't been to yet. We'll take everybody Shai, Roni, Adamico... Hadas, Zachi and the kids... Oren and his girlfriend... We'll take a van... And just... drive. Wow! It's so cool! What's this? A steering wheel. That's right. And where are we sailing off to? To find the "Blue Lion"! Very good! Do you see that point over there, at the nose? Yes. That can slice through anything, break through ice or push bad animals away. And with the wings, we glide on the clouds. Quietly and gently. And with that, you can go higher and lower down. Alright, let's go! I'm going up! But where to? Over there! Do you see that island? No. Over there, there is an island near the gate. But if we wanna get through, we have to pass the beast. I'm going down, going down. Even more... Until we land. I think I see it now. Okay, I'm turning and turning and turning. And now going down. And we landed! Slowly! Very slowly! Very slowly. There is the beast! There is the beast! Let's take the weapons! Lets go. This one's mine and that one's yours. Run! Run fast! Go! Go! Jump on the raft! I'm on it! The water is rough here! I have a plan: I'll go on the lookout and tell you where the light sword is... Okay. and where the beast is. Just watch out so that the beast doesn't eat you up on the way. Okay! Call me when you're up there. Okay! Do you see it? I see the beast! You do? Yes! The light sword is on the rock! It's the only way to defeat the beast! Wait. Grandpa! Take the light sword! There's the beast! Help me! I'm coming. I'm shooting! I'm shooting! Grandpa, are you alright? I'll get you the life potion! Here, drink this. Gul, come sweetie, we are going to the ceremony. Meir? Meir? Meir? I'm up here. Oh honey, what are you doing there? Guli left the screwdriver here. Okay. I need to go early for the sound check. Wanna join? You go ahead. I have a few things left to do here. I'll come later. Bye, see you soon.
