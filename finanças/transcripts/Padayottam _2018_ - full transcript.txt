To stay away from home until we come back from Kasaragod... Well, I was just saying... None of you have to come. I'll go alone. Like hell, you will. Bro, what I'm saying is that... You don't have to say anything. It's not that. Bro, his phone is with us now. Can't we call his family or friends from this and ask where he is? If he hasn't left Trivand rum, can't we get hold of him here itself? Correct? No Sree. That won't work. There's another problem. A a If one more personjoins us, notjust Kasargode, we can even go to Punjab and hit him! Who is that, bro? Raghu. Chenkal Raghu. Bro, do we have to involve Raghu Annan in this matter? He is a psycho!

I also felt really bad. Iam really thinking about it. Thinking about it, it seems. When I tell my son here, he doesn't even react to it. He's staying as a bachelor because he couldn't marry Thankamani. Every motherwould wish to see her child's marriage. Whom do I say this to? Who will listen? Filmwn E Here he comes. Emgw a - Why don't you get married? - RaghuAnnan is coming. Have you seen Raghu Annan tightening his punching bracelet?

Ems E Like Abhimanyu was surrounded in the Mahabharat, while was holding a wheel. Ascene like that. They had swords, shields and whatnot. What he had... was just a small piece of a blade. Just five minutes. Is that so? Then? As if you don't know. Only footprints remained where those people were standing. All ofthem escaped. E E And then? So Raghu Anna.. Which is your brand? Shall we have a peg each? Did you guys eat something? No. We ate last nig ht. Keep quiet. What is this, Raghu Anna? After coming here? Come. Let's go eat something. Come. Let's go eat. Lunch is ready here. E a So Raghu Anna, it will be better that we eat from outside. You have it yourself. Nowwe can plan everything after lunch. Let's decide where to have lunch from, first. The 'Kolli' & 'Potti' from Shoshanna's shop is famous in Chavakkadu. What is this Kolli? It's a food item from this area. An item madefrom rice powder. Em a I come here for many body shows in this area, right? After digging a hole in the middle ofthe Kolli, you should pour the Potti curry into it. - Then you should have it. - ls it really tasty? Not as much as he claims. It's nice. - There's something elsethat not many know. You should keep two Papads on top of it. W515 ls it too farfrom here? Seems like you're really hungry. H@HH@E What is it? Ema“ That's okay. I'll go and get it. Okay. Bye. Renju, we'll go there forfive minutes. After collecting the cash, we'll have Kolli & Potti. - What say, Raghu Anna? - We're not in any hurry. Hey Britto bro.. Lonappi said that you had some case... This L0nappill It happened before I become a goon. I didn't have any money with me, no job, and when I felt that life had no meaning, I tried to commit suicide. It flopped! Then with all the fights and all, I reached this stature. There's no other case in my name. Except for this one. IPC 306 for attempt to suicide. The scene is that... to humiliate me every once in a while, the coun keeps hearings as it pleases. Amazing! I should havejust died then. Even now, whenl sit idle, I feel like committing suicide. Just like that. When the construction of flats are going on here, we send our boys for security. This is the cash dealing for that. Just five minutes. I'll be right back. After that, Kolli & Potti. Is he mocking us? - What all kinds of people! - Atotal spelling mistake. I'm also coming. Peeing is fine.. Don't overdo it. What does land cost over here? Around 3 Lakhs? We can get it for 2.5 Lakhs. Do you want? Sreekutta... Did your uncle's property get sold? Who knows? You're his nephew, right? Did he sell it without consulting you? Hey! Why do you want to know all that? I was just asking, bro. Renjuttan, can you do me a favour? Can you give company to this nut? Hello! What's happening? Sc**wed! Who is it? A E- [hmppnam]? A E - Did he jump? - Raghu Anna!

A a - Britto, go! - What's the matter? Chechi, you have more ofthis yellow chutney? E E Britto, what's the matter? That scoundrel who called me to give the cash... He had given a contract against me. The guy who fell from the top? It's his building. I have to stay away for 2 days. Let me come back here after that. I'll get back at him. Raghu Annan... You guys get down here. Don't be tensed. I'll arrange another vehicle to go to Kasaragod. Let me talk. Get down. - I'll tell you. Come on. - Get down. Dude, is he ditching us? Almost like that. Hey! You don't worry. Either I will come back, or my people will come. You should wait here itself. Phones might not be reachable. Okay then. I'm really sorry. I couldn't buy the Kolli & Potti from Shoshanna's shop for you. It's okay. We'll have it next time you come here. Okay. Bye. Loser! Is he the great Chavakkadu Britto? Schmuck! He's a goon, it seems! He's walking around with a suicide note in his pocket. His damn Kolli & Potti. To drink a little water, he blocked the card I had. Em a E4 a What is it, mom? What's happening, son? We're on ourway.

We started in a car. And now we've ended up in a lorry. Such a plight! So, straight to Kasaragod. It's tapioca! So this is what he was referring to as Kolli. What did you say? Item made with rice powder? He has eaten it a lot, it seems. Why do you lie so much, bro? There's another item called Kolli, man. Made with rice powder. I swear on my mom. That's Kolam. Used to draw sketches in front ofthe house. - This is Kolli. - Whatever. What is this, bro? You also don't object to it. EFEnJm Bxflmflmgju H; Give it here.
