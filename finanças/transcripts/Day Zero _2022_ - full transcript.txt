The death toll continues to rise due to the dengue outbreak. The World Health Organization is now helping the government to combat the spread of the disease. People are struggling to get treatment at hospitals. Recent footage reveal effects of an alleged dengue mutation. Reports say those infected with the mutated variant exhibit violent behavior. - Fuck. - There have been... Fuck! Ninety-four, ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred! We're done here! It's a win. Twenty pesos. Twenty pesos. Marasigan. Alright, back to your places. The warden wants to see you. - Good game. - Move along. Easy money. Want some? Come in. Hello. Sit. You have an impressive record. Eight years here and not a single offense. I don't want any trouble, sir. A former US Special Forces who doesn't want trouble. Aggravated Assault resulting to permanent disability. With that built, whoever gets in your way will be injured. It says here, Special Forces. No wonder the gangs here are afraid of you. I want to stay out of trouble, sir. I'll remember that. Ramon Marasigan, your parole is granted. You'll be a free man next month. Your mom is just worried about you. Let me go, just this once. Please! - Fine. - Thanks, Dad. Take care. Will do. Joey, where are you off to? Come here. Eat your breakfast. You have to go to school. You can play after school. Get out of here! Honey, let me explain! I don't need you! Don't ever come back! Mom, Dad, stop it! You smell so good! Can I see that? Wow. Move. Everybody out. Timoy. - Timoy. - Hey. - How's it going? - I'm okay. I heard something about you. Word is, you've been talking to the warden. Is that true? Of course not. I never talk to the warden. Then who snitched on our boss? Hold on. I would never do that. I don't know what you're talking about. I'll get going. Wait a minute. You seem to be forgetting that we're in the same jailhouse. Let me remind you who the real boss is. Timoy! What's taking you so long? What? Do we have a problem? Let's go. Shit. Those assholes are always looking for trouble. Good thing they left or they'll be in a world of hurt. Maybe you'll be in a world of hurt. Why? You're not going to help me? You're not helping me? You're not helping me? Bring it on. Ouch! Tap! Tap! Tap! My schedule changed last minute. I can't visit because I need to look after Jane. How come every time you're supposed to visit me, your schedule suddenly changes, Potchi? Stop calling me that. I'll see if I can come next time. That's what you always say. You just don't want to see me. Potchi? I'm sorry, but it's hard to work and raise a child on my own. How are things there? Timoy got in trouble again. But when I showed up, they all ran away. There you go again, - getting into fights. - It's not like that. The reason you're in there is you meddled with someone else's trouble. You haven't changed one bit. You always put your friends first but you never think of your daughter. You know, I'm really trying to stay out of trouble here. I have to go. I have a lot of work to do. Hold on... Mama, was that Papa? Is he coming home? I don't know, probably. Nobody knows. Maybe next year, who knows? Maybe next month. Or maybe, tomorrow? What's important is that we are happy right now. Let's worry about tomorrow some other time. Papa... loves you... very much. From now on, I'll always be right here. Wrong! That's chicken. Are you a chicken? Papa is like this. Not this. Papa loves you. How many times do I have to teach you that? Take it seriously. What if you say the wrong thing to your daughter? Tadeña. Where is she, anyway? I've been here two years and she hasn't paid you a visit. - I don't want her to. - Why? I don't want my daughter to see me in jail. That's why you have to work harder on your sign language. The kids I used to teach are a lot better than you. What? I am trying my best to memorize the signs. There you go. That's it! See? You're making me look like a bad teacher. Marasigan, your turn. You're not a bad teacher... What? …but you have bad breath. I don't care. How's my breath? Smells good right? You're exaggerating. It smells terrible. What's the problem? Didn't you hear? My parents were fighting again. Aren't you used to it by now? That's the problem. I'm so used to it. But I'm getting tired of it. Don't worry, I'm sure they'll make up soon. We'll get out of this place someday. Just as long as we're together. Do you promise? Hey. Sir Ruel! Sir Ruel! My dad is looking for you! Asshole. Timoy! You motherfucker. Let's try your luck this time. Wait a minute. Let's talk about this. Talk to this! Emon! What now, Marasigan? Warden... I thought you were staying out of trouble? But they started... I really thought you've changed. But you're too stubborn for your own good. You need to learn your lesson. By the way, you can forget about that parole. Warden! Warden! Warden! Ruel! Ruel! Ruel! Give me back the money you owe. I'll call the cops! Chief Oca is on his way. Hello, Beth. The line is bad. I can't hear you. Hello, Beth. What's happening? Gate's open! Warden said we're free to go! What? What are you waiting for? Hurry up! For real? Come on! They said we're free to go! Let's go! What? Hold on, Timoy! Where are you going? Holy shit, what's that? Son of a bitch. Let's go back. Here. Emon! Fuck you! Fuckers. Timoy! Don't come with me. What? You need me with you, fool. Shit! Motherfucker! Unlock the seat belt! Hurry up! Wait, it's locked! Timoy! Hurry! Bitch! There you go! She's not picking up? I need to go to my family. You better do, too. What? No one visits me because I don't have any family. Back in jail, you always helped me out. Now that we're free, it's my turn to help you. Let's go to your family. Alright. Let me get that. Let's go. These people become rabid and according to reports, they will attack anyone who's not yet infected. A lot like online trolls, right? But listen carefully to this. If there are no potential victims around, these monsters eventually fall asleep. However, they easily react to loud noises and will turn violent again if they are disturbed. Damn, what the hell is happening? You might be the next victim of those infected ones. So be very careful if you don't have any symptoms. Take care and don't leave your houses. Chief! Chief! Chief, please help us! Please help. We need help. What are you doing? It's dangerous out here! People are rioting outside! I know! Go home and lock your doors! We can't go home. They've taken over the third floor. The third floor? Yes. Did you see my son? - No. - We didn't. Let's go that way. Emon, wait up! What? What's that? Don't you want it? Do you want your kid to see you like that? Let's go. Wait for me. I may not look like a convict but now I look stupid. Why? Don't be picky. What matters most is that you're alive. Damn, this place is huge. Are you sure you know the way? Just follow my lead. That's what I'm doing. This way! I don't think they can see us. Right? I don't know. Just be quiet, or they might wake up. Where is your apartment? At the top. 7th floor. Top floor? You have a problem with that? - Not at all. - Just shut up. Run! Let's go! Emon! Emon! Hurry! Sheryl! Jane! Get over here! What? Let's go. They're not here. Hold on. It's too dangerous. I don't care! They're not here! Let's wait until it's safe. There's too many of them. What's your name? David. I'm Timoy, he's Emon. Do you live here? Yes. You do? Have you seen my daughter, Jane? And my wife, Sheryl? This morning, during the chaos, I saw Jane. She was with our neighbors on the third floor. Was Sheryl with her? I didn't see her. I found this, but it's too big for me. Put that on so you don't look stupid when Jane sees you. Thank you. Shit. That was close. Let's stay here for now, to make sure it's safe. We need to find a way out of here. No matter what happens, just stay beside me. Do you promise? It's Jane. Look who I found. Paolo. Hazel, get the battery! Where? It's in there! Give me the battery! Come on! Hurry up! Let's get out of here. Paolo. Let's go. Mom? Wait up, David. Where are you... David. Mom? Mom! David. Mom? Mom? Mom? No! David. David. Mom! Come here! Come on, David! Mom? Mom! We'll get her back. Let's go! David. Listen. We'll look for your dad. We're going to look for him, okay? Listen to me. David. We're going to find your dad. But we need to go with Emon. Emon? Help! Are you hurt? Come with me. This will hurt, okay? One, two, three! Give me that. Where's our daughter? Where's Jane? I lost her. And I couldn't find her. - Don't worry. - Sorry. Listen, I'm here now. I promise, we'll find her. That's Emon. He needs help. Let me think. I'll go first. When the coast is clear, that's your chance to escape. Listen to me, David. You need to get to Emon, he will help you find your dad. Do you understand? Do you understand? Yes. I'll go. Over here, fuckers! Timoy! Help! Come here, fuckers! Motherfucker! Move! There! Hurry! Over there! - Help us! - Open the door, please! Open the door! David? Emon, quick! Get in! Son? Dad? Son! I thought I've lost you. Dad... I saw mom... I'm sorry, I couldn't protect you both. But I'm glad that you're safe. Dad, they're the ones who helped me. Thank you. You're all welcome here. I'm Oscar. Thank you, too. I'm Emon. Mom, I thought you've left me. Whatever happens, I would never leave you. Are you hungry? Papa's home now. But this is not our home. What took you so long to come home? You don't like me? Papa really likes you. I love you, but... I need to be better. I've done bad things before. Many people needed Papa's help. But now, he's here to help us. Reindeer will always be here for you. Not reindeer. It's Papa. Papa will always be here for you. To my fellow Filipinos, I want you to know that the government is doing its best to address the catastrophic problem that we are all facing. I am asking everyone to stay inside your homes while we figure how we can deal with this tragedy. I have no words to express my sadness over what has happened, and the continuing violence that's destroying our cities. Thanks again for saving my son. It wasn't me. My friend, he's the one who helped David. I wasn't there, but I know he made sure he's safe. You know, David may not be my real son, but I love that kid. How long are you staying here? I'm not yet sure. But we're running low on supplies. I need to bring Sheryl to a hospital. Or wherever she can get treatment. She won't last long with that wound. I heard on the radio that there's a safe place in Marikina. That's where we'll go. There's a way, as long as those monsters are asleep, we'll be safe. Right. I noticed that too. Sir, even if we can get out of this building, there's a lot more of them outside. That's going to be a problem. Wait a minute. You're not from around here. How did you get in? Through the basement. It was relatively safer. We should plan this carefully. We have children with us. I already lost my wife. I don't want to lose my son too. We'll plan our escape tomorrow. Give that to me. You know how to use this? Let's get some rest. Dad. I'm sorry. Don't worry. It will be okay. Pack your bag. We're leaving for Marikina. Emon! David! David. What happened? David! David! David! Paolo, Hazel, we're leaving! Let's go! No one leaves! No one can leave! Oscar, let's finish off your son! Boss, Linda's right. I know it's painful but... that's not David anymore. Damn you, Linda! I didn't mean to... Go to hell! Let's go! Sir. Hurry, let's go. Hazel! Hazel! Hazel! Just leave me! I'm not leaving you no matter what. Do you promise? I promise. Emon, what do we do? On my signal, go and hide over there. How about you? I'll be fine. Go on. Mama, how about Papa? Don't worry. He's on his way. You can't run from me! Oscar, Emon didn't want to kill your son. That wasn't David anymore. That monster was about to kill my daughter. You have no right to take my son away! Now, we'll suffer in hell together. Motherfuckers! I'm over here! Jane. Jane. Jane. Jane! Jane! Don't worry. When I catch you, I'll kill you in front of your Papa. Come out. Come here, little girl! It will just be a little cut, so I can watch you suffer. Come here! Get away from my daughter! Jane. Jane. Are you hurt? I'm scared. I need you to come to me. More are coming. I know you're scared right now. But I need you to trust me. Okay? Wait for me. Love, when you get out, take the ambulance. It's parked outside. I left the key inside. Go to the safe place in Marikina, like Oscar said. We'll go there together. I've been bitten. Emon. Maybe there's a way. It's okay. Emon. We're together now. We're finally complete. I couldn't keep our family together. Sorry for the wasted time - that I wasn't here. - No, don't say that. Nothing was wasted. It won't be wasted. Come with us. Come with us. What happened? Jane, you'll have to go with your Mama. Why, Papa? I don't want you to leave me. Please. You're always leaving me. You're finally here. I waited for so long. Jane, Papa needs to stay because he has a mission. I don't want him to. Papa loves you very much. From now on, I will always be right here. Always remember that. There are still a lot that we don't know about the situation. According to some sources, the victims become violent while others say that whoever gets infected immediately dies. We don't really know the whole truth, as authorities continue to search for answers. Until we are certain, I urge everyone to stay inside your homes. This has been a really catastrophic day. My condolences to everyone who lost loved ones. To those who are still listening, please take care. Hold your loved ones tight and keep praying. Only one day has passed, and no one knows what tomorrow will bring. May the Lord have mercy on us.
