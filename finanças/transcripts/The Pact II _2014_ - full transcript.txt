[PROJECTOR CLICKING] There's only one room you got to worry about, but it's a goddamn mess. Guy blew his brains out all over the walls. That shouldn't be a problem. [ PANTING ] [ HORNS HONK IN DISTANCE ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] You gonna keep that? [ MUSIC ENDS ] I'll hold on to it if you're just gonna throw it away. [ SLOW MUSIC PLAYS ] [ CELLPHONE VIBRATING ] Ballard. [ MUSIC CONTINUES ] Okay. Okay, thank you. [ DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE ] Special agent Terrence Ballard. Okay. Agent Ballard, let's just sit tight a minute. Why don't you just tell your lieutenant that FBI is here? Lieutenant... Ah, ah, ah. ...could you come out here for a minute? [ FOOTSTEPS ] Yeah. Is there a problem here? No, there's no problem. Just seems that officer -- what is it? -- Meyer and i are having a little disagreement. Great. He's clear to come in. Cup of coffee before we get started? No. I don't drink coffee. Make sure you cover your feet, too. It's pretty messy in there. Tell me about the woman. Her name was Ellie Ford, 28. Dmv records say she moved here from Houston three years ago. Checked her phone? Her cell's missing, but we know she kept her 713 Houston area code. And? We're pulling the records now. Who found her? Building manager -- found her early this morning. I read your report on when they found Judas last week. It was good. Yeah, well...Since you were in town, it made sense to get your opinion on this one. What are the similarities? The wrists and ankles bound with wire, uh, marks and bruising from struggle and resisting, ultimately killed by decapitation -- everything matches the Judas m.O. Except for a couple of things. What things? I think it's best you take a look for yourself. If you're in here, who's watching the front, officer meyer? [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] Agent Ballard. I can have forensics give you copies of photos. I prefer to take my own. Thanks. Excuse me. [ CLICKING CONTINUES ] Where's her head? That's the first difference. We think he took it with him, but we're still sweeping the area, just in case. That's a pretty big difference. And that is an interesting touch. [ INTRODUCTION PLAYS ] ¶ In the dark, i call your name ¶ ¶ you take my hand ¶ you hold me tight ¶ i pull you in to the dark you're -- ¶ [ DOOR OPENS ] [ CLICKS ] Morning. Good morning. You're home late. Yeah. It was a shitty night. Yeah? [ SNIFFLES ] Yeah, the last call was a homicide. I got stuck guarding the crime scene. Oh, that sucks. Mm. You're getting started pretty early. Mm-hmm. Busy day. I got a job booked, and I'm taking mom to n.A. I just want to get a little more done. And I'll make us some breakfast. Okay. So, what was the crime scene like -- messy? Oh, yeah, it was pretty messy. And, plus, they brought in this...Dick from the FBI. It's pretty weird to bring in the FBI, right? I guess he was already down here working on that dead but, of course, he walked in like he owned the place. What? Want me to beat him up for you? Would you? Yeah. Really? He's -- he's -- he's pretty big for a short guy. No, it was embarrassing. I mean, they didn't even tell me they were gonna bring him in, which made me look like an idiot. They already book a cleaner? Oh, no, probably not. Put in a good word for me? Yeah, I'll put in a word for you. Why, thank you. [ CHUCKLES ] No problem. Babe? Yeah? You think you're overbooking yourself? Well, i got to work, right? Yeah, of course, but, i mean, you've been working a lot lately. Well, i got my mom to take care of. Honey, she's holding you back. What's that supposed to mean? Look -- look, she takes your time. She takes your money. She's my mother, Daniel. You know, I'm gonna go to work. I'm late, anyway. Well, wait. Wait a minute. What about breakfast? June, wait. Wait. I'm sorry. Look, I'm not trying to make you mad here, okay? I'm... You've got...Such a great opportunity with your work here, and i just don't want to see you lose it. I know. I got you something. Daniel, you don't have to get me anything. I don't want you to think it's anything more than a -- than a -- a token or something. Just...I, um, i saw it, and it made me think of you. Wow, it's really -- it's really pretty. Is it too big? No, it's -- it's fine. It's perfect. Thank you. Okay, I'm late. I got to go. Okay. I'm gonna be late. Yeah. June, i love you. Okay. [ DOOR CREAKS ] [ ENGINE RUMBLING ] [ SLOW MUSIC PLAYS ] [ SIGHS ] Hey, honey. Hey, mom. [ BRAKES SQUEAL ] Margaret abbott. March 9, 1996. Okay, we're recording. So, let's start with how you left your 6-year-old daughter June in the car. [ CLEARS THROAT, SNIFFLES ] It wasn't on purpose. Usually, with my dealer, it's just real quick. You know, it's like in and out. And how long was it? Mm. I don't really know. I lost track of time, i guess. So you were high. Yeah. Um, i didn't plan to, though. I wanted to leave her, but he had me do a shot with him right there -- you know how it is. So it could have been an hour? Mm. Maybe? Even more? Couple of hours? Yeah, yeah, i-i guess. I mean, June told the cops that found her that she was only waiting a couple of minutes. Yes? I've got those birth certificates and hospital records you were looking for. Thank you. [ TAPE PLAYER CLICKS ] So she lied. Why do you think she'd lie? Mm. June's always looking out for me. [ MUSIC PLAYS ] [ HUMMING ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] [ VEHICLE DOOR OPENS ] [ MUSIC STOPS ] Hey. Hey. How was it? Uh. Hmm, hmm. Not bad. Terry relapsed, but we saw that coming. Yeah. Mom, you got to do your belt. Oh. [ SIGHS ] [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] Okay. [ SEAT BELT CLICKS ] Since when did you start wearing a ring? Oh, it's just something that Daniel gave me the other day. Daniel gave it to you. Why? Nothing. I just think he is really good for you. It's really beautiful, too. Yeah. It's not bad, right? Oh, wait! No, honey! I got to go in for my test before we go home. Right now? It's for my probation. Well, mom, how long is that gonna take? 'Cause i have a job later. If you're too busy, then that's fine. No, I'm not -- drop me off. I'll take a bus. Mom, i will take you. It's fine. I just wish that you would tell me these things ahead of time. [ SIGHS ] Okay. [ MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS ] [ CELLPHONE VIBRATING ] [ VIBRATING STOPS ] [ INTRODUCTION PLAYS ] ¶ In the dark, i call your name ¶ did you get a call from the station today? Yeah. They said they're gonna release the crime scene in the morning, as soon as the FBI gives the all-clear. Dan, i know you weren't trying to start a fight this morning. ¶ You hold me tight... Yeah, i -- it's just -- no, no, no, no, listen. I-i really appreciate how supportive you are. ¶ ...to the dark you're after ¶ what is this song? Oh, i just -- i just downloaded this today. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ CELLPHONE CHIMES ] [ DOOR OPENS ] Good evening, officer meyer. You've got to be kidding me. June abbott. Uh, yes? Terrence Ballard, FBI. Oh, you're the asshole FBI guy. Yeah, that's probably me. Isn't it kind of late? I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important. So you're not married. Nope. And, June, you work in trauma scene cleanup, right? Yes. Is that how you two met? No, we met in community college a couple of years ago. I'm sorry. Why exactly are you here? I'm an FBI profiler. My, uh, first case was the, uh, Judas killer. I began that profile over 20 years ago...When the trail went cold. Then the case is closed, right? Do you recognize this woman? [ SLOW MUSIC PLAYS ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] No, I've never seen her before. What's her name? Ellie Ford. I believe you're cleaning up her crime scene tomorrow. Now, i don't know what you've heard, but...I'm pretty sure this is the work of a Judas copycat. Have you been contacted by Annie Barlow? Annie Barlow? The woman who actually killed Judas. She's not returning any of our calls, and i figured... I don't know. Is she a suspect? No, no. I just... We need to speak to her. I'm sorry. What does this have to do with June? I think that June may be a target. Why the hell would i be a target? Well, seeing that your mother was one of the women originally killed by Judas, that puts you at the top of the list of women that -- i-I'm sorry. Um, you're mistaken. Uh, my mother is still alive. No, I'm referring to your biological mother, Jennifer glick. My mother's name is Maggie abbott. Well, not according to your birth certificate. I'm sorry. D-did you not know this? You were just at my mom's house, weren't you? I was, yes. I'm -- well, I'm trying to talk to anybody connected to the original case. Oh. Here. These are some personal effects of Jennifer glick. We don't need them anymore, so i figured that, well... Thank you. ...you may want them. Now...If i could just have a few more minutes of your time -- you know what? I think that I'm -- I'm done for the night. Um. Thank you for all this, but can we talk some other time? Okay. Yeah, okay. You know, can i hold on to this? Sure. Thank you. Good night. I'll show you out. This June's stuff? Yeah. It's her work. Oh. Mm. And you work mostly nights now, right? That's correct. And June -- she's here all alone? You're free to leave now. So you're just assuming that she's home in bed at 4:00 in the morning, right? If you have any more questions for June... You can ask her yourself. What do you want me to do with that? Take it. Just in case. Good night. [ DOOR CREAKS ] [ SIGHS ] [ SNIFFLES ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] [ MUSIC ENDS ] Hmm.

Miss abbott... He already knows what we were fighting about. Could you tell me, please? I had just found out that my mom wasn't my real mom, so i came over here to talk about it, and we got into a fight. I woke up this morning, and i felt bad, so i came over to apologize.

I've cleaned up enough crime scenes to know that people walk off with stuff sometimes. I was just making sure that all her things were safe. How long you been in trauma scene cleanup?

No. I profile them so i can stop them. [ MUSIC CONTINUES ] Have you always been comfortable with death? Why would you ask me that question? Because you picked a career where you wallow in it every day? Wallow in it? You talk about it like it's something disgusting. It's not. They're people. There's respect in what i do. Wow.

[ DOOR CREAKS ] The FBI -- they think that we're targets, but i-i wanted to -- so what it is that you wanted from me? Hang on. Wait. Wait. What if it's not a copycat? What if it's something else? What if, somehow, he found a way to come back? You mean Judas? Hang on. My boyfriend just came home. [ DOOR CREAKS ] Hi. Hey. Everything all right? Yeah. I'm just chatting to an old friend. Okay. I'm gonna crash pretty soon. I'm pretty beat. Okay. Annie. Look, i don't know what's going on here, but if you have a boyfriend, then why don't you go talk to him? If i thought he'd believe me, i would. [ SIGHS ] At first, i thought that it was all in my head, but...I know that there's something in this house -- something watching me, which i guess does sound pretty crazy. Look, i might know somebody that can help you. [ POUNDING ON DOOR ] [ ROCK MUSIC BLARES ] Yeah, yeah! Jesus Christ! [ MUSIC VOLUME DECREASES ] [ DOOR CREAKS ] We're looking for Stevie. No, thank you. Whoa, hold on! Get your goddamn hands off my door. Relax. I'm friends with Stevie. Just tell her that Annie's here. [ SIGHS ] She's gone. She left with her brother. Well, when is she coming back?

Hi, Annie. Hi, Stevie. Hi. I'm June. June's mom was Jenny glick. I can't help you. You don't even know why we're here yet. I'm leaving today. Giles has us packed already. Well, where are you going?

See, you can't see the whole picture because -- Stevie, stop. Annie, you're -- enough. Wait. No, Stevie, wait! Because -- damn it. Well, Stevie's right, you know? About what? About getting out of here. Look, June... If this is anything like what i dealt with... It's not worth it, and you should get out of here. Leaving won't make a difference. It's attached to me, whatever it is. The only option i have is to go in there and find out what it wants. Thank you. June. Why are you so convinced that it's Judas? Because i think he's my dad. [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] Hey. Hi. How are you? Good. Do you know this girl? That's Annie -- Annie Barlow. Oh, i thought you didn't know her. I thought you said -- Annie, this is Daniel.

Long before we ever met. [ CRYING ] Please stop. He told me how to find you. He told me... That you were Jenny glick's daughter. Do you have any idea... How special that makes you? [ BREATHES SHARPLY ] He speaks to me, June -- Judas. No, he doesn't, Daniel. He's dead! Oh, he does. I see him every time i look into your eyes. He told me that -- that you truly are the one person to carry on his work. That's what brought us together. No, Daniel, i loved you. [ CRYING ] I'm only here to help you. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] It's beautiful. Don't you see it? This way, we can do his work... Together. I almost shouted for Joy when you brought Annie home. [ CHUCKLES ] What are you talking about? Well, after tonight, i was gonna take you to go find her... But you did the hard part for me. Oh, you should've seen her face... [ CRYING ] ...right when she died. Oh, my god! Daniel, i didn't bring her to you! Yes, you did. And Maggie? You found the Bible page in my purse. Do you have the Bible here with you still? You can pick out a page. Oh, it could be our thing. I don't want to pick out a page, Daniel. Please put the knife down. [ SIGHS ] June... You're not even trying. Daniel... [ GRUNTING ] ...stop. Daniel, stop! [ MUFFLED SCREAMING ] Daniel, stop! Stop it! [ MUFFLED CRYING ] This is what you were meant for. I'm only here to help you take the next step. Now, take this knife... And cut off his goddamn head, so we can really get started. Aah! [ GROANING ] Ohh! [ GROANING ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] [ GRUNTING ] Oh, god! Aah! [ MUFFLED SCREAMING ] [ GASPS ] June! [ GASPS ] [ GRUNTING ] [ DOORS SLAM ] June? Aah! [ GASPS ] Honey... That's a pretty good trick. I'm realizing now that maybe... You weren't as ready for this responsibility as i thought. And that's okay. [ GROANS ] I love you, June. And I'm sorry... But i lied when i gave you that ring...And said that it didn't mean anything. [ BREATHES SHARPLY ] Truth is, i... I wanted to ask you to marry me right then and there. [ BREATHING SHARPLY ] But i chickened out... 'Cause i didn't want to scare you away. We have a special connection, June. And i never want to spoil it... ...not for the world. [ BREATHES SHARPLY ] [ GROANS ] So don't give up on me. I won't give up on you. [ SHELL CASINGS CLATTER ] [ DOOR CREAKS ] [ GASPS ] [ GRUNTING ] [ GROANING ] [ GRUNTING ] Ohh!
