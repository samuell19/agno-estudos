It's in the rue Casimir Perier. What's the best way to get there? By metro? (IN ENGLISH) Yes, it's definitely faster by metro, but let me think. Sorry sir, you want to go to the Church of Sainte-Clotilde? Yes. Yes. Take the line 4 metro here at the station to Montparnasse. Then line 12, direction Porte de la Chapelle. Get off at Solferino. Solferino. Yes. It will take you about half an hour. It's nearby. Do you want me to write it down for you? No, no, no, that's fine, I've got it. Thank you, you've been very kind, thank you.

Yes. I know. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) Lucy didn't come? No, no, she... She's staying in Maidstone. She couldn't get away. Just as well, I suppose. Are you staying a few days? No, I'm leaving tomorrow. Where are you staying? Little hotel around the corner, the Escalupe hotel. Esculape. Esculape, yes. (CHUCKLING) You're lucky. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) No, thanks. I quit. How do you feel? Pretty devastated. But calm. Do you mind me asking? No, no, not at all. Can I ask you something? Sure. Why did you come here today? I honestly don't know. I should go. It's better. I'll go pay for my coffee. (SPEAKING FRENCH) I'm ashamed. You disappeared. You were hungry? When I was five or six years of age in Maidstone, I had a huge crush on my elder brother's girlfriend. Her name was Norma Tisdale. One day, my mother invited her to lunch and we were seated beside each other. I didn't know what to do, I was panicked, breathless. And I reached out and I drank what I thought was a glass of water but it was gin. And then, she looked into my eyes I threw up all over her beautiful shoes. Few minutes later, I went to the bathroom and I was washing my face and Norma Tisdale came in and she looked at me. and I was so ashamed. Anyway, a few months later they broke up and I never saw her again. But I still wonder if I threw up on her because I didn't want my brother to have her or because I wanted to be alone in the bathroom with her. Both, probably. And probably so she'd remember you for the rest of her life. Why are you telling me this? Because on the scale of shame, you have a very long way to go. (CHUCKLES) Yes, but you were just a child. You haven't thrown up on me yet. Trying not to. (SPEAKING FRENCH) I have chosen to forget it. Today is a painful day. I'm not very good at pain. Who is? (MAN SPEAKING FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) I'd like to walk a little. Would you? It'll do us good. Would you like to join me? We can meet up with the others later. Yes, of course. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Yes, I just got to get something in my room, I'll be back in a moment. He is... He is quite a character, your friend Rodolphe. Yes, yes, he is. That's a lot of solitude for one man. Well, he's... He is a professor. Like me. Do you teach economy? No, literature. Sorry. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (GASPS) Did you take the ferry? I hate airplanes. And what about the Eurostar? If there's one thing worse than an airplane, it's a tunnel under the sea. Honestly, I would have swum or walked here, if I could. And what about you? Are you from Calais? Do you live in Paris? Do you spend a lot of time in hotel rooms with strangers? So what kind of work do you do? You're not speaking anymore. Schoolteacher? (LAUGHS) (MUMBLING) Slave driver? (LAUGHING) Actress? Yes. You're an actress? I see. Now I don't know whether you're telling lies or telling the truth. I could say the same thing to you. No, I say it because you're an actress. I said it because you're a man. Touche. To answer a cliche with a cliche. Was Rodolphe in love with Patricia? I get the impression he was. I suppose we all were. We were at the Sorbonne many years ago. We all wanted to be writers. She was a professor like the rest of us. But she was the artist. She was the only one who dedicated her life to it. You lived in Paris? Yes, for a few months. What happened to Patricia? She was a little too much in love with life... With the dark side... And she didn't care to grow old. Hmm, I can understand that. Yes. Her drug of choice was Calvados. She must have been in love a lot. Did she love you? She could never say it. And could you? About 800 times. Why did you follow me? Because you seemed sad. Because I wanted to. Really? Is that all? (KISSES) I didn't follow you. I went and found you. It's very different. (SIGHS) You have a good face. (SIGHS) Mmm. I love your eyebrows! And I love your jaw. It's a gregarious jaw. (LAUGHS) It's a serious jaw. (LAUGHS) Don't make fun of me. No, no, I'm not making fun of you. (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) Oh, only with strangers. I'm sorry but I... I have to... To make a call? Yes.

Yes. I wasn't far. What did you do? Nothing much. (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) I was looking for you. Don't you believe me? (IN ENGLISH) I came to say goodbye to you. I know. I came to tell you to take care. And you too. There's something I should explain, but I... You don't have to. (ELEVATOR DINGS) This is the first time I've cheated on my boyfriend. Oh. I don't think I want to know that. (SIGHS) Sorry. I'm sorry. Do you feel guilty? No, it's something else. I'm pregnant. Already? (LAUGHS) No, I'm serious. It's been seven weeks now. It's my first time. Have you seen a doctor? Yes. But I still haven't told anyone. Not even my boyfriend. I can't bring myself to. I've never had a child... I always thought I couldn't. For a while it was hard for me... Very hard. I'd even given up... After all these years, it's like the gods have sent me on some kind of mission. Do you believe in God? No, I don't believe in God... I believe in gods... All over, everywhere... Do you have any children? How many? (SNORTS) They've had time to love me, to hate me, to accept me. They're big now. (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) No. No. What are you afraid of? (IN ENGLISH) To lack courage... To lack serenity... Up until now, there were two things that didn't exist for me. The past and the future. Nobody expects you to have serenity. And as for not having what it takes... I know that you have more than enough. You'll be happy. (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) For a moment, I almost suggested that you come to England with me. What held you back? I can read the answer in your eyes. You can read my eyes? (SHOWER RUNNING) Let's go get some fresh air. What are you going to do in Calais? Back to Ibsen, I hope. Hmm. Some guys have all the luck. I wish I was dead and Norwegian. (CHUCKLES) You're going to be exhausted tonight. You'll fall asleep in your plate of snails. (CHUCKLES) And what about you? Aren't you tired? Yes, but... I have a good... (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) Cervelet. Uh, Cervelet, I don't know... What is it? It allows you to go easily from one state to another... Cervelet is like a little brain... Ah so you have a little brain? No, I hope not... So that's why you're never tired? No... It's like a little brain... In the brain.

It's strange! I'm nervous for you. Don't be... Everyone acts. I'm no less an actor than you in front of your students... I'm sure you know stage fright as well as I do. You know your lines? They're the only thing I do know. I don't want to make you late. I still have six minutes. You should go, Alix. Ah, it's the first time you call me by my name... What's yours? Doug. What? Douglas. Ah, Douglas. Douglas. Doug. Doug. We'll do better in another life! With other gods to watch over us... (SIGHS) This life is long, isn't it? Look after yourself.
