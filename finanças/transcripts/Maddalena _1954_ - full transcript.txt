- Filomena! Is coffee coming? - Right away, madam. [LAUGHTER] You're really crazy! That's not bad for a joke! A little naughty. - Aren't you scared? - I? No. What if they discover you? Who? You won't play a trick on me and talk? [LAUGHTER] If it works, I'll give you such gifts! You'll see! Why are you angry with that poor priest? You can't understand, dear. He's stealing the village from me! - What? - Yes! He's growing ever more important. Basically, he bothers me. Before, when I said "a", all would repeat "a". I understand. Now.. - .. he says "a". - That's it. [LAUGHTER] You know what? It's the cassock. Become a priest! [LAUGHTER] If it is to confess you, right away. Get your paws off! You're tickling me. [LAUGHTER] Oh, you came finally! Here it is. [WHISPERING] Again? Oh, that girl! Let's speak seriously. Don't you have other means to get rid of your priest? No, not at all. I need a scandal. I want the church to fall down with laughter. what if no one laughs? What do I care? As long as the priest leaves. Yes, but I don't know... What? If I can find you the girl. It's not easy. Sure, she must have the right physique. Right? That too? She could refuse. I know them. Because of religion? Because of the Blessed Virgin, my dear! I speak seriously. Yes, yes, yes, but... money is always something. With money she can find a husband. And all will end up honestly. No? [LAUGHTER] Maddalena, Maddalena! Get up, the lady wants you. She must have locked as usual. No, look. What's up? Are you sick? What manners! She's crazy! - Crazy? She's drunk! - You're disgusting! [INDISTINCT VOICES] She plays the great lady, she stays in bed. - Airs and graces! - So silly! Come in! Wait for me outside. Alright, ma'am. It's better if I speak. [INDISTINCT VOICES] [INDISTINCT VOICES] Good morning, princess! Still edgy? So much for edgy! Leave her alone! Come, sit down and eat. What a face! You bet! With what she drinks! Thanks for the shoe! Fortunately, you missed! You must stop treating us like that. Understand? Otherwise, you know what's going to happen? We'll slap your face. Who do you think you are? You are like us and even worse. It's the lady's fault: she gets away with murder. Who knows why? They like her, pour soul. Men have eyes only for her. [LAUGHTER] Stop it, stupids! Mind your own business. You ugly gossips. You'd better! She's right. Mind your own business. You lost an opportunity this morning. Maybe you'd have accepted. With your evil-doll face. Accepted what? To play Our Lady in a procession. You're like me: you'd have said yes. Earning something for nothing doesn't happen any day. Our Lady in a procession? What are you saying? Right, you know nothing. This morning a country guy came. A guy with money. where he lives, they do a procession on Good Friday. A girl of the village plays Our Lady. The girl who did last years is sick. You know what that scoundrel wanted? That one of us would take her place. Do you understand? One of us the Virgin! Yes, the Virgin! What do you say? It's impossible. It's true. Ask the lady. She told us. Tell us, would you have accepted? Would you have done it? Would you have said yes? Answer! Why not? 10, 20, 30, 40 e 50. Is it alright, Mr. Lamberti? Thank you. See you soon. Good bye. Mr. Lamberti! You didn't sign the check. Oh, I'm sorry! Lucky you! How I envy you! I wish I had so much money. You can do whatever you want. Well, no. Not always. This time I leave without arranging what I wanted. I don't believe it. Yet it's true. Good bye. Mr. Lamberti, a lady is asking for you. For me? - Pretty? - Very pretty. - Where is she? - There, in the lobby. Madam. No, no, please. Remain seated. What can I offer you? Nothing, thank you. Really nothing? No. Well, for later. So, a beautiful young lady really wants to talk to me? And when I say "beautiful", it's little. Like the sun. A true sun. Yes. Watching you is a pleasure. Let's see. What can I do for you? Mrs. Gertrude sends me. No! Yes. You are at Gertrude's? You? It's not possible. How come I didn't see you this morning? I sleep mornings. At Gertrude's. One would say, you know. It depends on the days. Do you accept? Yes? Yes. [TOLLING OF BELLS] What's the matter? They're here again. Then they found her. No way. Still nothing. Why did they come? What do they want? - They came... - I don't want to know. Send them away. I understand. Come, speak out. They're furious because they don't want a stranger. That wouldn't have happened, had they agreed. They've been quarreling for a month. Take my daughter. No, take mine. Mine, mine. My daughter here, my daughter there, they ended up choosing nobody. And now it's my fault that I searched for a stranger. Because I enjoy it, don't I? Writing to parishes, to convents, to find a girl that would play Our Lady, as if it were a boy to cultivate the vegetable garden. Basically it was I who wanted the stranger. A stranger who is not coming. So no Virgin and no procession. For the first time after centuries. All this because of their jealousy and stubbornness. Why don't you talk to them? No, no, and no! That's it. Where's the rectory? Silence! The rectory is at the end of the square, next to the church. You'll see it. Thank you. Don't you think it's she? It seems to me too. So he made it. When he decides to do something, he has to do it. Yes, but Don Vincenzo didn't take us into account. But what shall we do? She's here. We should have done it before. It's not over yet. Over? It starts now. You're right. Come here. I tell you what we should do. Let's go and tell the others that we take care of the young lady. [INDISTINCT VOICES] [BELL RINGING] Is that the way to ring? - The lady wants Don Vincenzo. - She's just come out of the bus. Oh yes? Come, come. I want to carry it! Leave this suitcase, away, away! Do you know who's come? Jesus, Don Vincenzo's stranger? Yes-sir, in person. She's come, she's come, Peppino, she's come! Who's come? The stranger that Don Vincenzo called. The stranger's come. The stranger? Yes the lady coming from the city, from Don Vincenzo. Sora Luisa, as soon as the door opened, looked at her and said (as if she'd be waiting for her a long time): come in, come in! All they had agreed. They knew she'd come and they told us nothing. "She won't come." "And we won't have a procession." "Poor me!" "Poor my brother!" Instead, did you see how she came right on time? It's a shame for us and for these poor daughters, these angels of God. Enough! Too much! As the stranger came, so must she leave. Did you see her? How was she? Not ugly. Better than Antonia? That's different, she's from the city. They tell you that she's come to play Our Lady instead of you, and you say nothing? - You say nothing, shame on you! - Stop it! Leave her alone! Did you see what's happened by leaving her alone? She'll be married in 15 days. What more do you want? What more do I want? My God, have you heard her? Four years! She's played Our Lady for four years! She was the most beautiful. Yes, the most beautiful! Why? Has she turned ugly? Since she doesn't play Our Lady, you think your daughter is full of defects. I used to say: she'll play her till she gets married. And on that day she'll enter the church with me, as if she'd still played Our Lady. Instead... He could have closed one eye! Within a few days. No, not even half! What a poor show for me now! You shout because you cannot stand in front of all like the past years. Before he goes to Heaven, the reverend Father will hear from me. You don't do such things to an honored family. What will you do? I don't know. But the stranger'd better return to the city. Very religious. Excellent behavior. Although we are not worthy, one of the most worthy. Well, very well. Has Mother Superior explained to you what to do? No, Father. She told you you would. Ah, of course. But see, it won't be hard. Have you ever acted? Acted? I? No, I mean acted in a religious festival, I don't know, in an oratory. No, never. What matters is good will. Anyway, we'll talk again. Your parents must be proud, no? They couldn't come with you. I'm an orphan. Oh poor daughter! It must be sad. Yes, Father, it's sad. Very sad. You live at the convent, of course. Do you like it? Yes, I do, Father. I work. I'm an embroiderer. Ah, embroiderer! Ah, and excellent job. Yes, it requires patience and taste. I know it because when I came out of seminary I took care of a nuns workshop. They were all girls like you, excellent. Alright then. You'll stay here till Friday night. I'll stay till I finish, Father. No, no, don't keep saying: yes, Father, no, Father. Call me Don Vincenzo, like they all do. Excuse me if I use your first name. But, with all these formalities, I feel awkward. Alright? Yes, Don Vincenzo. That's it. They are here again. Now they'll hear me. Come, Maddalena. Come in, come in, you too. Are you all here? Well, what's up? Don Vince' don't worry, in one hour we'll bring you the girl we need. Allow us to do it: we'll be fast and you'll be happy. Luisa gave us time till tomorrow at noon. You must wait till then. You should have done it before. Now it's too late. The girl is already here. That's it! We don't want her. She must be one from here. - She must go away! - Silence! I searched her outside because you forced me. And now I should say: "Thank you, ma'am, I'm sorry." "We don't need you any more." Is this your Christian charity? If you are ready to choose one of your daughters now, you're doing it against her. Out of malice. No, my dear. There is Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, there's that of Mercy, there's Our Lady of the 7 Sorrows, but there's not one of malice. And she won't be born here. Come here, Maddalena. And now, let's see. Is there one of you who would host this lady for three days? From today to Friday. Hey? You, Marta, have a house large enough. You don't have many people in your family. You don't want her. And you, Teresa? Neither. And you? You don't want her. You neither. So nobody of you wants her. You're really some true Christians. Very well. Thank you anyway. She'll sleep at my sister's house. Let's go. Down. Down! Down, come down. Come. Away! - Good evening, Sor Giovanni! - Good evening. Ah, Sor Giovanni! Finally. Where have you been? We've been looking for you all day. Oh yes? What's happened? - What? You know nothing? - No, nothing. She's come. - Who? - The girl. The Virgin for the procession. They finally found her. Good evening. I'm glad. Good evening, Giovanni. Good evening. Have you heard the news? Yes, now I understand why you're in such a frenzy. How's the girl? - Really beautiful. - Tall, slender. And so classy. She has such eyes! Just ask Sigh. Ah, because also Mr. Sigh has an opinion! Absolutely! He came in yelling like a mad man: "I saw a woman so beautiful that I fear it was only a dream." And he added she was like, like... How did you say? He said she was like a glass flower, so delicate you couldn't look at it for fear of breaking it. [LAUGHTER] Why do you laugh like that? A flower that can be broken with a look is a nice image. Mr. Sigh, you're a poet. I wouldn't be surprised if she were a good girl. She is a good girl. And I don't like hearing you talking about her. He's in love. More than in love: the wedding is likely. Sigh is for marriage. Marriage? I'd like to see it. She's really good. Do you know where she comes from? From a convent. From a convent? From the Ursulines. Mother Superior sent her to the Pastor. Then, my boy, you can sleep in peace. Dear Giovanni, sorry, but there's nothing you can do. The girl is not for you. Well, well. I give her up gladly. Women who smell of Holy Water and I... That's good! Lucky you, always laughing! I'm not laughing much for now. But rest assure that I'll laugh. I'll even laugh too much. It's not much, but that's the best I can give you. The gardener slept here, when he was here. Now we keep the fruit here. Can you smell the scent? But the bed is good. Don't worry. It'll do very well. Not very well, but for two nights, at your age... I put special sheets for you. They're fine, you know? Look! Look at the embroidery. Beautiful, hey? Yes, beautiful. Very beautiful. Thank you. They are from my trousseau. My mother, rest in peace, prepared it. But the Lord didn't want me to marry. Never mind. All that God does, is well done. Do you have a trousseau? A trousseau I? For what? To get married, what the heck, no? Wouldn't you like to have children? [DOGS BARKING] Who is it? Two dogs. Their master is not worth more than them. Well, good night. Lock the door. Rest well. Mater dolorosa. Our Lady of Sorrows. You! You! What more will you do to me? Tell me, what will you do? Pray brethren. Have you seen? She's close to Sora Luisa. They are so full of attentions for her. They made her come. Who knows what's underneath. [WHISPERING PRAYERS] Did you see how she pray? She never moves. Praying? Who knows what she's thinking. It's our fault. She shouldn't have stepped into the village. Wait, wait. There is always time to drive her away. So is that the great beauty? She's giving your her back, dad... So? She should be beautiful giving her back, no? Yes, yes, alright. Stop it. I know who must stop it. Easy, what manners! This morning at Mass there are also those who never come. Don't turn! Everybody's looking at you. Maddalena! Maddalena! What are you doing? And she comes from a nuns convent? She doesn't even know you must lower your head at the elevation. What do you mean? I saw her! She was looking at the ceiling. Then say nothing, because you did the same. I was looking at her. You'd have done better looking at the ceiling too. Did you see, Sor Giovanni? It seems like Sunday. Everyone for the stranger. I too wanted to go and see her, but my wife... You know, women... Is she really so beautiful? I'll tell you when I see her. I was right. She was standing! Standing, understand? Moreover, she laughed. Yes, standing! Silence, gossips! Antonia's father told me... He can say whatever he wants. It doesn't matter to me. Others saw her too. Lucia, for example. Lucia, come and tell Don Vincenzo. Yes, I saw her. Did you see her laugh? No, not that. But she wasn't praying. Yes, she wasn't praying. How do you know if she was praying or not? One can pray with his head high, no? Keep quiet! I, for example, pray with my head high, low, left, right. It's the soul that matters. I pray even when I'm in bed. If one hanged me by my feet, I'd pray with my head down. One prays how he happens to be. You, try praying while standing. It'll do you good. If you came to tell me to send her away, you're wasting time. She comes from faraway and we must be careful with strangers. My father used to say: "Who knows how to make hens, sat on them." Nonsense! I tell you one thing only: it's 7. At 10, that is after three hours, I start rehearsal. Woe to the absent! You know I'm not joking on this, right? If you knew what's going on! The women are all wild. They almost beat Don Vincenzo! What do you know? - I was there! I saw here. - Really! Why? Because of her. She's going back to the city, I bet. Don't say nonsense. It's true. She won't play Our Lady. The women don't want her. But they don't decide. Don Vincenzo does, no? What? You defend him now? No, but the pastor takes care of with such things. Don't you think? Yes, but the women want to stick their nose, they talk of sending one to the convent. - To do what? - To see, they say. Then, if they think like that, it becomes serious matter. Wasn't there a letter from the convent Superior? Signor Giovanni, when women decide to find evil, they invent it, if necessary, but the find it. Women are less stupid than what one thinks. You know it better than I do. Dad, look! Be quiet! Don't touch, by God! Here's the mantle. Is she wearing it tomorrow? Yes. Do you like it? Then give her a kiss. Maria, what's the matter? Maria! Always Maria! Yes, here each family has one. It's for devotion. Not just that. More than 100 years ago, a little girl from the village was lost in the woods. All were looking for her. They called her. But nobody answered. Yes, dad: the wolves answered. The wolves howled, they didn't answer. Don't interrupt me. Where there was no more hope, suddenly a flower sprouted in the snow. Then another, then another. Many flowers of all colors. A road full of flowers was formed. At the end was the child, white and red, safe and sound. You forgot the best part. When they asked the child who had saved her, she said it had been a beautiful lady, all dressed in blue, whose name was Mary. That is Our Lady. It was Good Friday. That's why tomorrow you'll wear the blue mantle like at the Apparition, and not in mourning like elsewhere. Come, go and kiss the lady. Go, move on. How long do we have to go on with this? It's difficult to talk to you. Well. Did the letter work? Yes. Very well. With your face, I was sure. It's a deceiving face. It deceived also you, Mr. Lamberti. No need to say mister, you know. If you wish I can call you by first name. For me it's all the same. It's not for me. It's strange, you know. I swear, I don't tell you stories. I don't know what's going on with me. All night I couldn't sleep because of you. It's a fact. Last night, a girl I see from time to time came. I told her to go to hell. This too is fact. No? Listen. Have you ever met somebody who wanted to take you out... of that place... to make you live with him? I understand. It didn't work out. Why don't you try again with me? It's safer with a man of my age, you know. What do you have to lose? Answer! What do you have to lose? Well? I came to play Our Lady in the procession and be sure I'll play Our Lady and nothing more. Nothing more! Listen, Maddalena, let's talk about that. I was wrong in involving you in this affair. Religion here is a serious thing, very dangerous. You speak to me like this, you! It's in your interest. It could end badly. You're too good. It might be a joke for you, it's something very different for me. I am ready to pay dearly. Because I've already paid dearly, very dearly. What do you mean? Nothing. I'll do what I have to do and return to Gertrude's. No, you'll come with me! Leave me alone! If you regret your money, I'll return it to you. Then why did you accept? It's my business only. Mine and nobody else's! Maddalena, you're crazy. You don't know what you say. You won't play Our Lady! Oh no? - Who can stop me? - I can! You? Really? Do you want me to tell all? Can you hear it? Come and see. [RELIGIOUS CHANT] Look! They walked all night. They come to see a Virgin with a blue mantle. If they discover who you are, it'll be terrible. Trying to scare me is useless. It takes much more with me. Beware, it's dangerous! It wasn't I... who started it. Come, move on! Are you all sleeping? Praetorians, come this side. The white-hooded in the front. The black-hooded in the back. Christian women after Christ. Jewish women behind. Is it possible I have to repeat the same things every year? Come, quick, to your place. Rocco, I don't remember if I was a thief or a soldier. Always steal at the market, here do whatever you want. Come! At your place, quick! What are you doing? Don't move! Stop it! Come! Silence! No! He carries the cross because he's better at catechism. Come, hurry up! Where are the apostles? Come! Come here! Quick, go there. Are you all here? - Who is Matthew? - Here. - Thomas. - Here. - John. - Here. - Philip. - Here. What? Are there two Philips? My name is Philip. I remember I'm James. Which James? I don't know. Are you the son of Alphaeus or Zebedee? Of the late Nicholas. No, I'm not talking of your father. There are two Jameses: one is Alphaeus' son, the other is Zebedee's son. I am Alphaeus' son, Don Vincenzo. Then you are Zebedee's son. Go! I won't be Judas any more. Why? I almost lost one eye last year. Be silent! It was not because you were Judas that they bruised your eye. Go! Where is Peter? His cow is giving birth. Well, you'll play him. You have no cow. - I have troubles, Don Vincenzo. - And you drown them in wine. Last year you sang some ditties instead of the psalms. I thought I was doing good. I don't know the psalms. Then keep silent and just move your mouth. Don Vince'. She doesn't want to go with the old women. It's so difficult to find a husband. And you put me with the old women. Alright, go with the young women and find a husband quickly! Understand? I've been here for years, but I can't remember an Our Lady like you. You're really beautiful. Come. Look! You are like her. Like her. Yes. I'm sure you resemble her a little inside too. This time the mirror doesn't lie, you know. When I came here with my brother I was very young. He wanted me to be Our lady, because he couldn't find one. The previous year a girl did it... who wasn't a virgin any more. Well, when she put the mantle on... Did she die on the spot? No, but she was struck dumb. She remained dumb for 15 years. It took 15 years of prayers for Our Lady to grant her the grace. [CONFUSED VOICES] [VOICES STOP] She looks good, hey? Good! Wonderful! Hey, what manners! What a boor! [VOICES OF WOMEN] Poor fellow! How he suffers! [LAUGHTER] He's so nervous he can't stand still. [LAUGHTER] Come, now we'll make him die! [CONFUSED VOICES] Don't you go watch your sweetheart? Go to hell! Be not afraid! They won't spoil her. They only look at her. Boors! Who knows where she comes from. I don't think she's even got a father. What do you know? A father, as I say, would have accompanied her. Having a daughter playing the Blessed Virgin doesn't happen any day. The women are right. I know nothing. But when a dog comes from unknown parts to my house, I drive it away with stones. It's not easy. You represent the Mother of God. The Sorrowful Mother. The very image of sorrow. Even more than sorrow. Be silent! You too listen! It won't harm you. You see, everything passes by in this world. The sorrow of the Blessed Virgin doesn't. Because God is eternal. As long as men offend Him, He will be crucified. Every hour, every minute, every second. Try to express this sorrow, you understand? Maybe these things are a little difficult for you, but let's try. Sustain her! Attention now! Let's start rehearsal. All forward! The choirs also. Go! [RELIGIOUS CHANT BEGINS] Don Vincenzo! Don Vincenzo! What's the matter, Maddalena? Are you sick? Are you sick?? Back off you. Come! Back to your places. Away! You too. Back to your places. Let's move on. Don't get upset. I understand, you know. It's nothing, you see. Nothing. Now go home and tell Luisa to give you a glass of wine. It'll do you good. Go! Rocco, go with her. I go on with the others. Her sandals hurt her when she walks. She gives herself airs. That's the way. Did you see how attentive Don Vincenzo is to her? I'd like to see what you'd do, if you were as beautiful as her. [CHANT RESUMES] [INAUDIBLE PRAYERS] [START] Mother of God! Blessed Mother! You! You! My son is dying. Dying! Grant me a grace! Save him! Don't take him from me! He's all I have left. He alone! Let him go! It's all I have in this world. Save him! My son is dying, I tell you! Save him! Save him! Why don't you answer me? Tell me yes! Tell me yes! You told me yes! You told me yes! [SHE CRIES] I saw her! I saw her! It was she! I saw her! I was praying. I turned myself. She was before me. It was she. Our Lady, yes, Our Lady! [CROWD NOISE] [CHANT RESUMES] [WOMEN SHOUT] [CROWD NOISE] What are you saying? Don't tell nonsense! No! Be silent! Come, stop it! Vincenzo, have you heard? Our Lady! Yes, I know. She appeared to Rosa and told her she'd save her son. Poor Rosa! May the Lord really grant her this grace. You don't believe it? The church is full of people. Come and see! What does this prove? Yes, it's true. Yes, it's true, true, true! Silence! Silence! What! Are you all gone crazy? He's crazy. Not the others. Come, women, let's go to church. Take off your costumes and go home. Go, away! Don Vince'! What do you want? If we don't do rehearsal, tomorrow how... Tomorrow Our Lady will do another grace, since she's started. Did you see? We only needed that that poor woman should start daydreaming. Now if her son dies, they'll say it's Our Lady's fault. Go and change yourself! Have also you something to tell me? No, nothing. Then go. Rehearsal tomorrow morning. Don Vincenzo! What is it now? I warn you that you chose the wrong time to resume your complaints. No, Don Vincenzo. We come to tell you you were right. We understand now. Understand what? The Blessed Virgin protects her. - Whom? - Signorina Maddalena. If she appeared to Rosa, she must be happy that tomorrow Maddalena will play Our Lady. Yes, because she sent her to us. It's a blessing for the whole village. Finally. Then we made it. Did you agree? Yes, Don Vince'. - Are arguments over? - Yes. - For real? - Yes, Don Vince'. We can really say that the Blessed Virgin has made a miracle today. [KNOCKS AT THE DOOR] I'd like to see the child. Come in, come in. She'd like to see the child. I had 4 sons. Two have gone to America. One died in the war. He's all I have left. But Our Lady told me she'd do me a grace, you know? Are you sure you really saw Our Lady? Face to face. As I see you know, miss. Maybe it seemed to you you saw her, no? What do you say, miss? I saw her. I really saw her. She was in the light. I told her: "Don't make my son die!" She lowered her head to tell me she would save him. Yes, yes, sure. But what if it wasn't she? How is it possible? It was she. Miss, why do you say this? Do you want to break my heart? If I knew for sure it's not true, that Our Lady didn't speak to me, that she doesn't do me the grace, I'd fall dead before here before my son. Is the doctor come? Yes, but what does he know? When is he coming back? Who knows? He lives far away. Where is he? Does anybody know? Where is he? Do you know? Yes. Let's go. Wait, miss! He's going to call the doctor. No, no. I am. The road is bad. You're not used to walk. It takes 2 hours. Go and tell him to come right-away. If he's not in, wait for him. Be sure that he's taking the doctor to the village. Meanwhile, please, come to my house. No, no. Come, come, miss. Come and see my daughter. She's been on this chair almost since she was born. Look at her legs: she hasn't moved them for 7 years. 7 years! Our Lady doesn't think of this poor angel any more. Tomorrow tell her that she too is in this world. She listens to you. Tell her, Vincenzi', to pray for you. Tell her to make me run like Ninuccia and Peppino. They're my children. They're always with her. I want to play like they do. Will you tell her? Yes. Come, come to my house. My father is very ill. He cannot walk. My son always quarrels with his father. Tell Our Lady to make peace. My husband left me with 7 children. Tell her to make him come back. They're selling my house. Tell her to help me. Miss, pray Our Lady to protect my son. He works in the mines. I'm so scared. Miss, my brother is in jail. He's innocent. What did mine do? He left for the war 8 years ago and hasn't come back. Let me go! I am nothing! I can do nothing for you, nothing! Leave me alone! Believe me, you're all better than me. You must pray. You! Only you! Not I. Not I. Miss! Do you want a grace too? No. I mean yes. What do you want? That tomorrow, after the procession, you don't go away. Why? I'd like you to meet my mother. Your mother? Yes, it's true. You can't understand. I can't explain. Yet if you knew how may times I repeated it in my head. Now I remember nothing. Above all, please, don't laugh. No, I won't. Anyway, you'd do like the others. Since you came, all make fun of me. Make fun? Why? I'm in love with you. With me? That's not how I wanted to tell you. So much for that. Now you know. Who are you? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't even introduce myself. Giovanni Belboni. My friends call me Sigh. Sigh. Nice. Why? Are you sad? Sometimes. But I can be merry, you know. Stay and you'll see. No, I can't. Do you want to leave? Why? Are you engaged? I should have thought. I was hoping. I have nobody, but don't ask me questions, please. You too are unhappy. Yes, Sigh. Sigh. They give me other names. Ugly though. - Ugly to you? - Yes. Why? People are bad with me. And you too would be bad with me. You too! Good bye, Sigh. Good bye. Miss! Here you are. Couldn't you get in touch? What are you doing? I'm leaving. Good. You made up your mind. You understood the game was getting dangerous, hey? More than you think. It would be crazy to run such a risk. Beside, here I am. I'm serious, you know. You made me 20 years younger. It's true it's never too late to be happy. Just think, I talking like this. It really must... Behind the church, at the crossroad, there's a big tree. You can't miss it. In 10 minutes. The time to get the car. Don't you understand? I'm leaving alone. Alone? Ah, you're joking. No, I'm not joking. It was the pastor who... Ah, no, you're wrong. I told him nothing. Be not afraid. But if you don't let me through... I call him and tell him everything. Alright. As you want. Then in the city. Tomorrow at the hotel. Why won't you understand? What's the matter with you? Listen, I am ready to do anything for you. - Even... - Even marry me, hey? I love you, Maddalena. It's ridiculous but it's true. Yes, it ridiculous. What did I do to you? Nothing, really nothing, but let me go away! No, you won't go away! I decided to forget who you are, but I can remind myself, you know? Listen, tomorrow, yes, tomorrow... Ah no, sweetheart. Stupid yes, but not twice. Don't be so uptight. - It's your job, no? - Help, help, Don Vincenzo! Don Vincenzo, help, Don Vincenzo! Don Vincenzo! Go away. Shame on you. Alright. Congratulations! You found a fine Our Lady. Hold on tight to her. It might help. What are you waiting for? Come, drive me away! Drive me away, drive me away! I can't take it any more. I can't take it any more. He took me here. He gave me the letter. Yes, Father. And he paid me. But it's not for this that I deceived you and the village. I wanted to insult God and Our Lady. Especially Our Lady. I lied to you, Father. I lied to you. What are you saying, Maddalena? I'll tell you all. All, because now... You believe I come from a convent. It's a strange convent... where I come from. I am a prostitute. Yes, a prostitute. Of the worst kind. Don't ask me how or why. You forget certain things. One would like to forget. Because of love. Really love. Love. When these things happen... you either die of shame or you live of it. And I lived. I ruined my life. I don't say this to be pitied. I already pity myself too much. I have much disgust even of my pity. But one day my life changed. It's just about this I want to tell you, Father. You must know why I came here and I did what I did. If my life... suddenly changed and I... I became happy. "Happy" was a word that would always make me laugh. Then I knew what it meant. It seemed as if I hadn't lived before. It was so. The other girls noticed... my happiness. They were envious. Yes, sick with jealousy. One day, entering my room... I couldn't believe they'd come to that. I was caught in terror they'd found something. They only needed to open a box at the bottom of the drawer. Their hands, their eyes on what I had most sacred. No, I wouldn't bear it. I began to scream so loud that my cries could be heard from the street. They looked at me as if I'd gone crazy. Yes, I was really crazy. Suddenly I realized that one of the two was hiding something. "Show it me!", I told her. I was out of myself. I'd have strangled her, had they allowed me to. Maybe they had opened the box and taken the portrait inside. It was my love's! If they had found my secret, who knows how much evil they could have done to me. I grasped her wrist and squeezed it till it hurt. I was strong. I grew up in the street, I was used to screams and to brawls. Fortunately, it was Our Lady's image. Oh, yes. I believed in her. When I went out to visit my love, I thanked her because she protected me, even if I didn't deserve it. Sure, it wasn't enough to wash my face, but what more could I do? I went out once a week. That day was all for me. Nobody knew where I was going. Nobody knew who I was. I carefully hid my trade. My love lived little far from the city. But the trip seemed to be ever longer and more annoying. I don't know why, but the train was full of men. Their glances fixed on me irritated me and offended me. But as I walked that tree-lined path, my heart began to beat strongly. I was approaching my love. I'd see her soon. My love lived in a nice palace in a quiet street. When I arrived, I always looked at a window on the second floor. It was her bedroom. That day the main entrance was open and there were many people coming in. I preferred when it was closed. Because then I could enter alone and people scared me. I was always afraid to meet somebody who knew me. But once in the palace, I forgot it all. I felt happy. I remembered on that day an even stronger feeling of happiness. How the mind can deceive some times! I didn't know who her father was. She was mine, only mine. They took her into that boarding school, only because an old nun at the hospital had had pity on me and had told a big lie. She said that later she would come to an agreement with the Lord. It was prize-giving day. The hall was full of many moms. What would I have given to be like them. How I envied them! How I hated them! To stay with me she didn't even go greet the Bishop. We were made to live together. It sounds silly to say it, yet how many moms, who pretend they love their children, don't feel the need to have them always with them, as I always wanted. The climax of the party was the offering of the letters to the Virgin. Each child had her own letter. All had asked something very important, what they wished most in the world. Each letter was to be burned before the statue of Our Lady. She alone must know what it contained. Maria had her letter too and she wished me to read it, but she wouldn't say. I couldn't even imagine that children had serious thoughts, sorrowful like ours. She had written: "Make me live with mom." "I always cry when she's not here." I was beside me with joy and sorrow. It was my fault that she suffered. After a while she joined her friends. Very serious, she waited to go and burn her letter. Each mom is convinced that her daughter is the most beautiful all all. But mine was really the most beautiful. I began to pray the Virgin with all my heart. And I said: "Grant her what she asks of you." "Make her live with me." I begged her to watch over my daughter. I had named her like her. When I placed her in that boarding school, I didn't entrust her to the nuns, but to her, who for me was her second mother. "Don't abandon her, be close to her!" I finally said to her. And I felt tranquil, because I was sure she'd always protect her. Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! She had killed her. My daughter! My daughter! She! And she was her second mother. Another mother. Why did she kill her? Why? You must have suffered much to think this of the Mother of God. The Virgin is love, forgiveness and you... you wanted revenge. But we can't have revenge on Our Lady, my daughter! Yes, Father, it's true. I was crazy. How can I be forgiven? It's over for me, Father, over. No, Maddalena. God forgave another woman with your same name. And He wanted her to be a witness of His death and of His resurrection. Will you also ask Him for forgiveness? Yes. Then, repeat with me: My Father, forgive me in God's name. My Father, forgive me... in God's name. I absolve thee from thy sins in the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy + Ghost. Amen. And so, doctor? I'm sorry. I'm no longer needed. Shall we call the pastor? Unfortunately. The pastor? Yes, your son is very seriously ill. At this point, it's difficult to save him. My son won't die, doctor. Our Lady will do me a grace. Then tell her to hurry up. Stop, stop! Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us... I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty. Water. Where's the water? Oh my God! Rosa, Luca is better. What? Son! My son! Mom! Nicola, can you hear? Bells on Good Friday! My Jesus! What's happened? Giovanni, the bells! Who know what's happened! Oh my God! Wait, I'm going to see. No, don't leave me. I'm scared. What's happened? Is it Easter already that they sound the bells? Something extraordinary! Rosa's son is healed. Her son healed? Yes, he's very well. Then it's a miracle. Holy Queen! Let's go and see! Vincenzo! Vincenzo, did you hear? Yes, I did. What's happening? Bells on Good Friday. Somebody's gone crazy. Who is sounding the bells? Neither I understand. Maddalena, what's happened? A miracle, Don Vince'! Our Lady saved Rosa's son. Yes, he's healed. He was about to die. He's healed. It was just like that. She prayed. She wanted to leave. Look: she even carries her suitcase. Why did you want to leave? You may beg, Sora Luisa. She won't speak. We too asked her. She doesn't answer. She's become dumb. [CONFUSED SHOUTS] Will you be silent? No, she must stay here. We need her. The village wants her. The Lord sent her to us. He wants her like we do. [CONFUSED SHOUTS] Be silent. How can I tell you? You must not yell. Just explain calmly. Don Vince'. After the procession, she can do what she wants, but now she must stay. Rest assure she won't leave the village even if she wants to. I tell you so. Father, I must leave. And right now. I can't remain here. It would be sacrilege. Yes, I know. You absolved me. The Lord forgave me because there was a miracle last night. I saw it. I can't. I can't wear that blue mantle. I must leave. You know it too. Well. Then you want me to tell the truth. Right. There's nothing else to do for you to be able to leave. Do you want that? Yes. No, no, no. Then what shall we do? I see no other way. What shall I say to you, daughter? I understand it no more. However, if it were really bad that you stayed, He would have told me how to get you out of here. Instead... We're really in God's hands. If God wants me to stay. I stay. But don't abandon me, Father. I'm scared. At you places! Stop! I told you to stop! Look how beautiful she is! Have you seen how sad she is? She looks like Our Lady of Sorrows. I never saw an Our Lady like her. And Don Vincenzo? He's coming. The Mass is almost over. If he died, it was the doctor's fault. Since he's healed, the stranger did it. What a wonder that girl! Be silent, Dome', we are in church! Don't talk, I beg you! Alright. Let's be silent. Here he is. Giovanni! Giovanni, Giovanni! Come with out. Come out. What are you doing here alone? Everybody is outside. Won't you come to the precession? To the procession I? What for? Have you become stupid? To see Our Lady. You never know. She might convert you. Stop all this nonsense! She did a miracle. For me she's a woman any more. - What more is she? A saint? - Why not? Saints like her are at every street corner. - Listen, Signor Giovanni... - Ah no, dear. This isn't the time. Why won't you be convinced as all the village? Why are you obstinate? It's strange. You know: I, religion...still! Still what? She saved the child. These things you can't explain but they make you think. - Were you there? - What matters? All know how it happened. She came in, she prayed, he opened his eyes and was healed. Now we just need to put her in a grotto and let the next for miracle step in. You have no right to talk like that of a woman you don't know. Ah, don't I know her? No, you never saw her. A woman like her... you are not worthy even to glance at her! Poor child! You only have the right to look at her. Yes, clean people like me. Hear him! By dreaming of her night and day, young master thinks the girl is his. No, my dear, instead I tell she is everybody's. Now stop it! Do you know who your saint is? Do you want to know? Come. We'll laugh! Open up! [HE KNOCKS] Open up! [HE KNOCKS] Open up! [HE KNOCKS] What do you want? What do you want? Aren't you ashamed? Coward! Out! Drive him out! Out! Out! What are you doing? Are you crazy? Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing? Let me speak! Let me speak! Let me explain! Let me speak! I must speak to you! I must speak to you! Are you gone crazy? Doing this to me? You forget too soon who I am. If I did so, I have my reasons. You must listen. And she herself will tell you. You, my darling, tell them who you are and where you come from. Tell them, my dear love, what your job is. Tell them that you deceived everyone. Maddalena, answer! Answer, in God's name! Let her answer, speak, defend herself! You won't believe it, hey? Wait a second. Guess! Where do you think she were before coming here? In a boarding school? In a family? In a convent? In a streetcar? In a coffeehouse, in a hotel? Come, search, search! In a gutter? No, lower that that. In a brothel! It's not true! Look if it's not true! If she comes from Heaven, she got lost along the way. Come, all on your knees! Before your saint! Stop her! Run! Damn her! [CONFUSED SHOUTS] Take here away! Shameless! Scoundrel! Disgraced! Shameless! It's my fault! It's my fault! It's that accursed fellow's fault! Who could have imagined something like that? My God, grant that nothing happens! Scoundrel! Stinker! Sow! Slut! Come out! Show yourself! Whore! You're making fun of us! You are shameless! A whore! I never believed you. Nor I! I immediately saw the kind of woman you are. What did you want to do? Tell us, wretch! You're scared, hey? Hell is not enough for you. Swine! You liked to play the saint, hey? You enjoyed it, hey? You polluted our homes! Ugly harlot! I'd drag you through the street! I'd break your head, ugly bitch! You said you came from a convent! A virgin! We need to have it blessed 40 times before putting on someone else. 40? No, 100, 1000 times! We need to burn it! How much did they pay you to do what you did? We'll take you back to where you came from with kicks, spits, and slaps! Leave her alone! She's a poor wretch! Is the sacrilege she did nothing for you? Why did she come here? She offended us all! For God's sake, leave her alone, dad, leave her alone! Let me go! He'll kill her, kill her! Don Vincenzo, Don Vincenzo! Incredible! Fortunately you were there, Sor Giovanni! Coward! Coward! You are a coward! - I? - No, I! Do you understand? I! Slut! Harlot! Whore! Stop it! All stop it! Show me how beautiful you are! What if I trash you? But I don't want to soil my hands. Who has a stick? Kill her! Stop! Assassin! Maddalena! Maddalena! Maddalena! Maddalena! Maddalena! Maddalena! Maddalena! Maddalena! Maddalena! She was a poor woman and we killed her. In His mercy, God had absolved her. May He forgive us. Let's bring her to the church. Give it to me.
