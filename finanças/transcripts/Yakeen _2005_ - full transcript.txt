Mrs Oberoi, I am Dr Kapadia. Are you feeling all right? Just two hours ago you met with a terrible accident. You need to rest. But you are fortunate. Despite falling 50 feet, you only have some superficial wounds. I wish your husband was as fortunate as you. Where is he? He is in the ICU now. If he can hold on for 4 to 5 hours, his life will be out of danger. Please lie down. - But, doctor... Please lie down. Everything will be all right. Relax. Sometimes good and bad times occur at the same time. I have good news and bad news for you, Mrs Oberoi. The good news is that your husband's life is out of danger. Sit down. The bad news is that he has lost his memory. He regained consciousness last night for a while. But he doesn't remember his name, address or identity. He couldn't even recognise the photograph of the two of you that was found in his wallet. Perhaps it's due to the shock. We also felt so. But after looking at the CT scan report, I'd say that he is suffering from psychogenic amnesia. It doesn't cause the patient to forget reading, writing, driving a car and such day-to-day activities. But he doesn't remember his past. For how long? Six months, a year, two years or maybe 10 years. I can say anything to comfort you. But I can say from personal experience that in cases like this one, the chances of regaining memory are bleak. Doctor, may I meet him? There are fractures on his right leg and his jawline which can be fixed. There is a cervical dislocation. To cure that, he will need to follow an exercise regimen along with medication. What about his face? I might be able to bear it, but he won't be able to bear to see himself like this. I understand, Mrs Oberoi. We have removed the glass splinters from his face and other parts of his body, But complete recovery will happen only after surgery. In fact, I have spoken to Dr Vidyasagar in London. He is known to be the best surgeon for such cases. But the problem is that until his physical condition doesn't improve, we can't take him to London. Then call Dr Vidyasagar here! Spend any amount of money necessary, but my Nikhil... Give me back my Nikhil like he was earlier. Please. Did you think... I would let you go so easily? I... I can't let you go, Nikhil. I will take you home with me. Our home. Our home, Nikhil. What happened? Nothing. Welcome to your kingdom, Mr Oberoi! Welcome to your own house! This is our hall. The dining room is over there and then there's the kitchen. The guest room is over there, and there is the study. Now you tell me where our room is. Just a minute. Hello. Hi, Tanya! We just got here. We just entered. Yes. I was about to call you. Promise! Thank you. Thank you so much! No. Not now. But I promise you, I'll bring him over to your house as soon as he recovers, for dinner. Done? Yes and tell Siddharth that I wanted to meet him. Also, tell him not to call him regarding business matters. My husband should not undergo any kind of stress. Nikhil! I don't know what happened. I got scared of myself. You managed to save me, Simar. But I lost my memories. Man is nothing without his memories. That is what I am going through now. No. I feel as if... Someone has blindfolded me and locked me in a dark room. Stop it, Nikhil! The blindfold will be removed. And there will be light in the room as well. You only have to believe in yourself. Live in your present and not in the past. Listen to my heartbeat. It has nothing to do with your memories. My heart used to beat for you and even today my heart beats only for you. As for the memories... It was you and I who made those memories together. If we are together, we can make new memories. We will be happy once again. I promise you! Simar! I love you! Stop it! Well, sir, we have reached your office. Won't you come along? This world... I cannot be a part of it. You will find many people here. Some good. Some bad. There will be competition. There will be jealousy. You will have to face all that alone, Nikhil. You have started scaring me. Will I be able to do all this? Of course, you will be able to. When the mind refuses to make a decision, listen to your heart. Everything will seem easy. You used to say that. You're right. Thanks. Life seemed to be filled with thorns, my friend. Every moment seemed like an eon. Welcome to your empire, Mr Nikhil Oberoi! Siddharth! - Siddharth Thakur. Your friend. Your partner. I missed you, buddy. I really missed you. This is the office of Nikhil Oberoi, the great architect! What are you looking at, buddy? This is the place where you sat and designed more than half the buildings of the city. Now you sit here and familiarise yourself with the surroundings. I will go and prepare for the meeting this evening. Also, I spoke to Simar. Both of you are coming to my house for dinner tonight. I have met you, but Tanya hasn't. She has already called me ten times since morning and asked me whether you have come to the office or not. And whether you will be coming home with me tonight. If you don't come home with me for dinner tonight, she won't let me enter the house. May I come in, sir? - Come in. This is Priya. Your personal secretary cum personal computer. Priya, take care of him. You don't worry, sir. Really? - Yes. These are the files of your pending jobs. You were working on these files before you left. If there is anything you need, I am in the office next to yours. You can call me anytime. Thank you. Genius! I am a genius! I feel motivated when I see you. Why are you looking at me like that? If you can't hit a good shot, at least praise a good shot! I can't seem to figure out what is good and what is bad. What's the matter? How was the relationship between Simar and me, Siddharth? Just like it is between any husband and wife. There's love, there are tiffs, compromises and fights. If you ask me, I would say that marriage is all about compromise. That's why I'm still unmarried. The most handsome man on this earth is still a bachelor! Do you believe that? - Cut the jokes, Siddharth. What were the problems between us? There were no problems. Everything was great! Everything was, you know... If there were no problems then what is this? Why did I make my will before the accident? Why did I want to disinherit Simar before the accident? Why did I freeze the joint accounts? Come on, Siddharth. Tell me the truth. The truth is that we don't know what happened to you before the accident. Your behaviour with Simar had become strange. We tried to reason with you, but... But you had already made your decision. What decision? You had decided to divorce Simar. So tell me, Tanya. What else did you see? You are very lucky when it comes to love. You made the man you love yours forever. But take care of the man you love. Of course, I will. No one would dare to take Nikhil away from me! Would I also get you to read my palm? Of course, you did. You were single-handedly responsible for her becoming an astrologer. Well then, you must have told me that I'd meet with an accident. No. Perhaps, I couldn't read that on the lines of your palm. But I did tell you that some disaster would befall you. Thank God, Nikhil. You came back from the jaws of death. We also wanted to be around you at such a time. We returned from London as soon as we heard of the accident. But I think, Simar wanted to do everything by herself. That is why she didn't allow us to meet you even once. Come on, Tanya. It wasn't me, it was the doctors. They had given strict instructions that no one can meet Nikhil. In fact, they were not allowing me to stay there either. It was just that they had to give in to my obstinacy. Even God has to give in to the love of a wife. Doctors don't stand a chance. Tell me, Tanya. Will we love each other forever? You don't need to see the lines of your palm to know that. Just look into the eyes of your wife and you will know. Ghalib has penned a great couplet for such occasions. No, Siddharth! Not another couplet! If I hear one more of those, I swear. Lend me your ears... - I won't come here again. Did you hear that? Then I will come to your house! Then I'll have to leave the house! - Bye! Meet me alone tomorrow morning at the Wellington Club. Hey! You have come here much before time. Why have you called me here? I can understand your impatience. But the answers to the questions you were asking Siddharth may be better answered by me. Your marriage to Simar was a rushed affair. You had gone to the USA on a business tour. When you returned, Simar was with you. You were happy for a while too. But after that... - What after that? I have not called you here to complain about someone. I have called you here to tell you something important. What? - At the time of the accident, Siddharth and I were in London. You had called me a few hours before the accident. You were very angry. You said, marrying Simar was the biggest mistake of your life. And you also said something about evidence. Evidence? - Yes. You said that you have found some evidence against Simar. And that no one can save her from you. And what was the evidence? That's what I asked you, but you were in a hurry. You said that you would call me when you return. And you met with an accident that very night. What was the evidence that made you lose your temper? Where were you going in such a hurry? How did you meet with an accident? I don't know all that. But I am sure there was something about the evidence that could have helped you divorce Simar. Let me tie it for you. Were you searching for something last night? All the things in the study are where they shouldn't be. Yes. I was looking for some documents. Ever since you have come back from Tanya's house, you seem worried. Are you looking for something or are you hiding something, Nikhil? Was everything all right between us? No. We used to fight. You would be busy with your work. And I would ask you to spend time with me. You wanted success. And I wanted only you. All of you. Neither were you wrong nor was I. People might say that it was a quarrel, but I think it is just a part of love. Were we getting divorced? Who told you that? - Was it really that bad, Simar? No. You may have had some good and bad moments in your past. But good friends are those who remind you of the good moments. Your memory is your weakness, Nikhil. And people will try to take advantage of this weakness. You'll have to discriminate between good and bad, right and wrong, friend and foe by yourself. Remember one thing. No relationship is greater than the trust between a husband and wife. How long will you make me wait? What's wrong? I drank a little too much. Good night. It feels good to see you work, friend. Stop joking. I know I am a misfit for this chair. I have no clue what's going on and you are going to London. Come on! I am not going away forever. It is only for a month. Nikhil, if we get this contract, our life will be made. I'll get going. I have to pack my bags. And if there's anything, I'm just a phone call away. Good luck. Priya, can you come in? Sir, you had asked for the appointment dairy. Yes, Priya. Please read the appointments for 29th November. Sir, on 29th November you met 4 people. At 11.30, you met the chairman of Mittal and Mittal Company, Mr Mittal. At 2, you had a lunch meeting with the PWD director, Mr Anshuman. At 4, you met the chairman of the planning commission. At 6, you met someone named Chamanlal. Chamanlal? He came without an appointment. And when I told you about him over the intercom, you asked me to send him in immediately. As far as I remember, after meeting him you cancelled all the other appointments. And you went out angrily. And you met with an accident that night. Priya, can you find out... Who is Chamanlal? "O Lord of the universe," "mighty is Your splendour." - Excuse me. Are you Chamanlal? Praise the Lord. Nikhil Oberoi. So, you are back from the hospital? What can I do for you? Do you know me? Mr Oberoi, if you try to remember even your past happiness will make you sad. You are very fortunate, you don't remember anything. Go home and start a new life with your wife, that's it. After seeing the photographs do you think there's no way I can learn what happened in the past? I want to know everything about myself. I want to know everything. You have to help me, please. Well, Mr Oberoi, I had taken these photographs because you told me to. But let me make this clear. Spying is my profession, not my business. Do you get it? I tell you, people make mistakes. A moment of weakness caused by loneliness should be forgotten. All I want to know is, who is this man? And since when is he having an affair with my wife? Just think. Your wife has helped you a lot after your accident. You can be happy again. - What the hell is your problem? Don't you understand? I haven't come here to listen to your lecture. I want to know about my wife's lover. I want to know about my past. Do you understand that? Nikhil. I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. Okay. If you want to reopen your wounds... So be it. I quit doing this after your accident. But you will get the rest of the information in the next twenty-four hours. Just know this, for now. The name of the man is Kabir. And he works in the music band at Hotel Picasso. He doesn't work here anymore, sir, I tried to reason with him, but he remained unconvinced. Ever since he has left, think that our band lost its glory. We hardly have any patrons now. I did so much for him. I got him a job at the night club of a five-star hotel. A company car. The company guest house. He had become a star overnight, sir. Girls in the city were crazy about him. If success goes to someone's head, there's nothing we can do. He came to me and told me he had got a job in Singapore. He resigned overnight and just left! I have no news of him since then. Where did he live? - In the company guest house. Do you have the address? In my office. I will get it right away. Excuse me. Why do you want to go to his house? I want to know... Where my wife used to satisfy her lust. What's wrong? Why aren't you eating? Where are you going? - I am not hungry. You aren't hungry? How is that possible? I was cooking your favourite dishes all evening. I'm sorry. I have to go out for some important work tomorrow morning. Nikhil! Have I erred in some way? Ever since the party, you aren't talking to me or eating with me. When you leave the house, you don't reach the office. After you leave the office, you don't come home directly. Have I made some mistake? You don't even share your feelings with me. Even you don't tell me everything. Nikhil... - Simar. I won't ask questions and you won't demand any answers from me. I want to be alone. Leave me alone. Leave you alone! How can I leave you alone? How can I leave you alone? I have married you. I didn't love you to leave you alone. I brought you back from the jaws of death. You were in a hospital, and I was fighting death. I stood in front of your bed for six months. I didn't leave you alone for a moment. And now you tell me to leave you alone. You should have let me die. I have called all the hotels in Singapore. Kabir doesn't work in any of the hotels there. Second. Kabir Malhotra's passport expired two months ago. And he didn't renew it. How can a person leave the country without a passport? So. He lied to his hotel manager. Perhaps he was compelled... To lie to the manager of the hotel after your accident. Why? - I will tell you. Look, Nikhil, that night, your car passed through crooked roads to reach the mountain, it climbed up the mountain, and went straight to the edge. And then it took a fifty-foot fall. Looking at the state of the car anyone could have said that you must certainly be dead. It was impossible for you to survive after a fifty-foot fall. Your wife was with you in the car, yet there were just a few scratches on her face. It could be a coincidence. But this cannot be a coincidence. Look at this. This is Kabir's resignation letter. He submitted it on 29th November. The day you met with an accident. Are you trying to imply... That Kabir and Simar tried to kill me? You don't believe it, do you? There are many things in life which are unbelievable. That means, he can make another attempt. He can for sure. But before he makes an attempt, we must find him. You must find out where Kabir is hiding. Hello. Kabir! Forget all that and listen to me. I think, Nikhil suspects us. He is trying to find out about you. Go back to Singapore as soon as possible. Don't be stubborn, Kabir. Please. If he gets to you, he will come to know everything. He will even find out that we... I cannot tell you over the phone. All you need to know is that it's better for everyone that you go away from here. Don't be ridiculous, Kabir. Let alone meet you, I had to travel 20 km just to call you. What if our phone is tapped? You know I love you. Of course, I love you. I love you. Do you think I'm happy leading a double life? Do you think I'm happy without you? Okay. Okay. I will make some excuse and come to meet you for two days. And there shouldn't be any mistakes this time. We will have to end this matter once and for all. Why did you stop me? Why did you stop me? Why did you stop me? - Look, Nikhil. I knew that you'd make a mistake in a fit of rage which is why I followed you. Did you think that you'd kill Simar there and you wouldn't be sent to prison? - I don't care about myself. And I am not alive to watch her having an affair with someone. You want to punish Simar, don't you? Then, let her do what she's doing. What should I let her do? She is cheating on me. And I am watching the drama. She wants to meet him, and I should let her? Yes, let her. Let her meet. Because until she doesn't meet Kabir, you won't be able to meet him either. The man who cheated you. The man who snatched your wife from you. Will you let him get away, Nikhil? Simar will lie to you and go to meet Kabir for sure. She got away because of you today but... The day I get to Kabir. Nobody will be able to save them from me. They will remain alive. Until they stay away from each other. I don't feel like leaving you. If it wasn't my aunt. Are you going forever? It's just for three days. And Shimla isn't too far, anyway. If I miss you, I will come there. I will come back as soon as aunt feels better. But you didn't give me your aunt's phone number. I had given you the number if she had a phone. I will call on your mobile. Don't think that you are alone, Nikhil. And always remember. Whenever the mind refuses to take a decision, you should listen to your heart. Everything will seem easy. - Right. Whether it's the heart or the mind that decides, believe me. I will make everything easy forever. Now what? - We wait. Hello. - Nikhil. You were right. She didn't go to Shimla and alighted at Dharampur. Good. Follow her, we are on our way. - Okay. 0Hi! Come in. Nobody has come to meet her as yet. Let's go there. There... That is her room. I think, that's where they will meet. But he has completely changed after the accident. Kabir, right now, he needs me and I need him. Whatever was there between us is now over. I've just come here to tell you to leave for Singapore as soon as possible. I'll go, but not without you. Why don't you understand, Kabir? I am tired of lying to Nikhil. So what? - I can't do this anymore. You weren't prepared to listen to anything over the phone. Hence, I had to come here. You will have to listen to me now. - What? You need to understand that I cannot be yours. Why don't you tell me clearly that you love Nikhil? Yes, that's true. After the accident, I realised how much I love him. I love him, Kabir. - Stop your nonsense! I have been hiding here like a coward because of you. That's why I'm telling you to leave. Nikhil will never tolerate this. And what about me? - You will have to forget me. Forget you! We have to end this matter once and for all. I cannot cheat on my husband anymore. Please, Kabir. Get this straight. If you try to dump me, I will kill you as well as your husband. It's a dead end. Where did the car go then? Get out. He is coming towards us. What are you doing? Nikhil! What... What are you doing? Chaman, are you okay? I am all right. Go behind him. Don't spare him, Nikhil. Go! Hey! You have tortured me a lot. If I wanted to, I could have killed you too. But first, I want to see your face. Now come on. Show me your face. Kabir is dead. He never came here. I pretended to be Kabir to mislead you. You are lying. I just saw the two of you together. No. You saw what I wanted to show you. 'You need to understand that I cannot be yours.' 'Why don't you tell me clearly that you love Nikhil?' 'Yes, that's true.' 'After the accident, I realised how much I love him.' 'I love him, Kabir. - And what about me?' 'You will have to forget me.' 'Forget you!' 'We have to end this matter once and for all.' 'I cannot cheat on my husband anymore.' 'Please, Kabir. Go away from my life.' 'Go away! What do you mean?' 'Get this straight. If you try to dump me,' 'I will kill you as well as your husband.' I knew that you'd follow me here with Chaman. So, I made it seem that Kabir was alive. Why did you do that? Why? Because Kabir didn't die a natural death. You killed him. Not once, you shot him twice. You killed him. You killed him. It is true that I loved Kabir. But that was a phase of my life before I got married. It was my mistake. I didn't know... That he would come back into my life. When he came here... He started blackmailing me. He told me that if I didn't do as he said, he'd tell you everything. I didn't want to lose you. Therefore, I had to go whenever and wherever he called me. One day, you came to know everything about us. You went to Kabir's house to catch him red-handed. You lost your temper. The two of you got into a fight and you killed him. We hid his body in the boot of your car... And buried it in a forest. We were on our way back after burying the corpse, when we met with an accident. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Should I have told you... That you are a murderer? And that your wife was unfaithful. You had forgotten everything. I just wanted you to remember the good things. But that didn't happen. You found the photographs. And then you went to meet the detective. You had killed Kabir. And you asked the detective to find him! You didn't realise that if Chaman could find Kabir, he could find Kabir's killer too. I didn't want you to go to prison. Hence, I decided to pretend that Kabir was alive for the benefit of you two. I had planned to push Kabir's car into a ravine and end the matter for good. But you caught me before I could do that. You will have to complete the job that I couldn't, Nikhil. I made Chaman and Tanya think that Kabir is alive. But you will kill him now. You will tell them that you saw Kabir's car fall into a ravine. And everything was over. Great. He died his own death. But it's not your fault, Nikhil. You didn't want to kill him. It was just an accident. Unfortunately, you couldn't see his face before he died. Anyway, we should leave Dharampur at the earliest. Nikhil. - Yes. What is it? Nothing. I was thinking that you now know how much Simar loves you. Forget the past and start life anew with Simar. Hello! - Nikhil, come to my house immediately. I have a lot to tell you. Is everything all right? - Nothing is all right. Nikhil, you are being deceived. Deceived! - Yes. I cannot tell you everything over the phone. Come to my house immediately. Remember, Nikhil, don't tell anyone. Okay? Bye. Tanya? Tanya? Tanya! Tanya! Tanya. Tell me, Tanya. What do you want to tell me? Tanya. Nikhil. Tanya. Nikhil... - It wasn't me. I remember, Chaman. - What do you remember? Is there a forest nearby? Yes, there is a forest. But Tanya wanted to tell me something. She wanted to tell me something too. What did she want to tell us? - I don't know. I don't know what she wanted to tell us. But take me to that forest. Please, Chaman. Take me there. Please, Chaman. Nikhil! If he's Nikhil then. Who are you? Are you Kabir? Darn you, woman! Please just shut up! I don't want to listen to your rubbish anymore. When have you ever listened to me? And you listen to everything, right? I'll tell you what? Just get out. But it's pouring outside. That's why. You might calm down when you get drenched in the rain. Just get out, man. Hi! Hi! You had to get drenched because of me. I don't care about this rain. I am thinking of the storm that's brewing in your eyes. Can I be of any help? Late in the night. A desolate road. A girl all alone. Rain... And tears. This is... That sums up my life. What if you hadn't helped me today? Someone else would have. I can understand how you are feeling. You don't have to explain or tell me anything. You don't need to know... But I need to tell you. I have been carrying this burden alone for a long time. I don't know why... I want to tell you everything. I married Nikhil of my own will. But I never got what I wanted with him. Nikhil's love... Turned into a rich man's greed. A status symbol. A medal he could show off proudly at the parties he attended. I'd thought the relationship of a husband and wife was everlasting. But in our relationship... I'm nothing but a doll to be shown off. This is the first time I've gone alone anywhere. But I have been lonely... Many times. I have always felt lonely. What did you tell me your name was? - Simar! Simar. I won't say anything about your relationship with your husband. But I'll surely say that you need no one but yourself. We always plead with others to find happiness. But our happiness lies deep within ourselves. The more you focus on yourself, the happier you will be. I thought you are just a musician, but you are a philosopher too. It's my mom's philosophy that echoes within like a song. There's one more thing that my mom would always say. The mind doesn't have answers to all our questions. So, when the mind refuses to make a decision, listen to your heart and everything will be easy. Your jacket... I toiled to protect you from the rain. If you catch a cold, all my hard work would be wasted. But I... We've met for the first time, but it won't be our last meeting. Thank you! Simar! Simar. Hey, Simar! I have a terrible headache. Where have you kept the disprin? At least tell me where the disprin is. You are still upset. What do you want? Want me to apologise? Okay. I'm sorry. Please tell me now where the disprin is. I don't want to speak to you, Nikhil. Please leave. It's open! Come in! Hi! Hi! You are getting worried for no reason, sir! In 15 days, the hall will change completely. If Mr Nikhil Oberoi wants to celebrate his wife's birthday here then it will be an honour for us. But Simar shouldn't know of this. It should be a surprise party. She won't know, sir. Well, I don't think anybody in this city must have thrown such a grand party. Can I tell you something, sir? Mrs Oberoi is fortunate to have a husband like you who loves her so much. I have been in love with her for two years, but I was always busy with my work. I couldn't give her time. And now, on her birthday, I want to start all over again. She'll meet the Nikhil Oberoi she had fallen in love with. That's the only way... To bring a smile back on her lips. All the best! Hey! What are you thinking? What's wrong? Are we making a mistake, Simar? What mistake have we committed now? This... The two of us meeting every day without Nikhil's knowledge. Getting closer to each other. Falling in love with each other. What happened to you suddenly? Why are you saying such things? Simar... I had just held the hand of a woman drenched in the rain. I never thought that I would be ruining someone's life. What are you trying to say? I met Nikhil. He's not what you think of him. His way of expressing love may be different, but... The truth is that he loves you. Am I lying to you? You think everything I told you was a lie! No, Simar, you misunderstand Nikhil. The love I saw in Nikhil's eyes today made me feel that you are betraying him unknowingly. I hope poor Nikhil... - Poor Nikhil! You developed sympathy for Nikhil after you spent a month with me in a bed. If I am cheating on Nikhil, what are you doing with me? Has someone else come into your life? What nonsense, Simar! You want to get out of Nikhil's way. You want to get rid of me. Don't be ridiculous, Simar! You know that you are the only one in my life. Why don't you tell me clearly that you don't need me anymore? All men are the same. You use women and throw them away. I am not that kind of a woman, Kabir! You can't get rid of me so easily. You can't dump me, but I will dump you and never come back into your life. Thank you. Simar. Simar, what are you doing here? We haven't met for two days. You don't answer my calls. - Simar. And you don't call back either. - Simar, get a grip. Kabir, don't punish me for such a small mistake. Simar, don't be stupid, someone might see us. Let them see. I don't care. But I do. - No, Kabir. Ask me how I have spent two days without you. I have realised that I cannot live without you. I love you so much. Simar, let me go. Please. - No, Kabir. I'll do whatever you say. Please, Kabir, don't leave me. Please. I cannot live without you. Please... - Will you do as I say? Go away from here now, please! Kabir, don't be so rude. Look into my eyes. Don't you see love in them? Don't you love me? I love you, Kabir. Please! Listen to me carefully. If you ever try to leave me, I'll shoot you. And then I'll shoot myself. I promise. I'll kill you, Kabir! You! You were going away! Simar. You didn't even think about what will happen to me. If I hadn't called at the hotel, I wouldn't have known. Simar... - You didn't even give me a chance to explain. If you had a problem with me... You could have told me. I was going to tell you over the phone. When? After you had left? After dumping me? Where were you running off to in the dark of the night, Kabir? If you are man enough, look me in the eye and tell me. Then listen! Meeting you was the biggest mistake of my life. I am going to rectify my mistake. Let me see how you leave. - Get out of the way, Simar! Kabir, stop it. I won't let you go. Kabir, stop! How can you do this to me? How can you leave me? Just leave me alone. Kabir, I am prepared to leave everything for you. And you want to leave me? Kabir! I cannot live without you, Kabir. Kabir, please. - Simar, get out of my way. Kabir, you cannot leave me! Simar! What were you trying to do? You said it. I was getting out of your way. For a long time now, I have been dreaming of catching the two of you red-handed. For the first time, I'm unhappy that my dream has been fulfilled. What did you think? Did you think... I wouldn't find out? Nikhil... Why did you betray me? What did I not give you? I was going to tell you... - Shut up! I feel like shooting both of you right away. But... Problems between a husband and wife are sorted out within the four walls of the house and not in front of entertainers. Let's go. I won't go, Nikhil! I don't love you. I love Kabir! Simar! Nikhil, stop this. You slept with my wife for two days and you forgot who you are! Nikhil, let him go. It's my fault. I had come here of my own will. Oh! So it hurts you to see him bleed. Nikhil, stop it! Get out! I will punish you for having an affair with someone's wife. You dare to touch my wife! Nikhil! - Out! Nikhil, stop it! Get out of my way! You shouldn't have shot him, Simar. I had no choice. - You did have a choice, Simar! He had come to meet us. You could've spoken to him. You could have divorced him. You could've separated from him. - You didn't know him, I did. He would have left me, but he would have never let us be together. But no one can separate us now, Kabir. No one at all. You wanted to go to Singapore, didn't you? I'll go with you. I'll sell everything I have and go with you. I have loved you truly. I really love you. I love you. What about the truth that we just buried? Nothing will happen to us. No will know what happened. Nikhil's corpse is on the other side of the border. Even if the body is found, the police can't do anything. Sooner or later the police will get to us, Simar. It'd be better if we tell the police everything. Don't be stupid, Kabir. The police will separate us. I did shoot him, but you will be punished too. You have committed this crime too. - Yes, I've committed a crime too. The crime of falling in love with you and deceiving your husband. And watching quietly when you shot him. I am prepared to accept the punishment for all my crimes. So, after the accident, they found Nikhil's wallet in your pocket and the doctor thought that you are Nikhil. You had lost your memory and Simar took advantage of that. She got your face changed. Nothing could have been better. No one would have suspected that Nikhil is dead. And the man she loved would be with her forever. But Tanya knew palmistry. Thus, when she saw your palm she knew you were not Nikhil. She got your blood group checked and learned the truth. And that was the cause of her death. But, Kabir, we cannot keep quiet now. We must go to the police right now. You regained your memory! I didn't want to kill him, honestly. You brought him here. And he came to know everything. I had no choice. He was destined to die and he died. We are destined to live... And we'll live together. Come on, let's go away from here. We will go far away. Nobody will know anything. Truly. Okay. I'll go with you, Simar. But not as Nikhil, as Kabir! Can you give my face back to me? What are you saying? You should be happy that we'll be together forever. Can you give my face back to me? We can talk about it later. We should get going before anyone comes here. Can you give my face back to me? I'll love you so much that you will never... - Can you give my face back to me? No! I cannot give your face back to you. But please try to understand. I did all this for you. How could we stay away from each other, Kabir? I did it for our love. - That's a lie! You are lying. No. - Not for love, for your selfish motives. No, Kabir. Everything you ever did was for your selfish interests. Because you are selfish. - No, Kabir! You speak of love. Love is all about giving. And you have always taken something from me. No. - My faith, my identity, my face. You'd also made me believe that I was the murderer. But for the first time, I chose to listen to my heart rather than my mind. And my heart told me that I cannot be a murderer. And that was true. Because you are the murderer. And you'll be punished. Kabir! I have committed the murder, but both of us are responsible. I'll have to suffer my whole life for the crime I have committed. Whenever I'll look in the mirror, I'll see someone else. But he will get you punished for the crime you committed. When the police see two Nikhil Oberoi's together, they will know what happened. You'll go to the police? Kabir! How can you do this? I did this to be with you not to be separated from you. Kabir! You cannot leave me! Kabir! Yes, I committed murder. But I killed only those who tried to separate us. Kabir! You cannot leave me alone. Kabir, stop it. Stop it! Kabir! How did this happen? Kabir! Kabir, I'm sorry. Everything will be alright. I'll take you to the hospital. We will start all over again, Kabir! Kabir! - Just shut up! Come on, get the car. Come on, move! You are making a very big mistake, Kabir. You'll get everything as Nikhil, and nothing as Kabir. Nikhil's status, his stature, his life and me. Neither do I want Nikhil's life... Nor Nikhil's wife. There's no place for you in my life. You should be in jail. And that's where you're going. - Do you think that you'll get rid of me by having me sent to jail? We'll be together in every birth. I won't leave you easily. Oh, shut up! Just shut up and drive. You won't take me anywhere, Kabir. I'll take you with me. So what if life has kept us apart? Death will bring us together. No one can separate us, Kabir! No one can separate us, Kabir! I want to register my testimony. My name is Kabir Malhotra. And he's Nikhil Oberoi. I was in love with his wife.
