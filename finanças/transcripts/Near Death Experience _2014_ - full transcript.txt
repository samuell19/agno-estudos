A film written and realized by Benoit DELEPINE and Gustave KERVERN With Michel Houellebecq I wouldn't like to talk about work But have you seen what happened to Patrick ? It's sure that Leave it. It's for me. Are you sure ? Yes, it's ok. Then tomorrow it's my turn. Then, see you tomorrow Paul ! Thank you ! See you tomorrow ! Yes. See you ! Thank you ! See you Paul ! How much do I owe you ? Eight, with the coffee. Give me another one. Yeah ! Yeah ! I owe a lot of money while I don't want to buy the moon You know what is it ? I do not like my race It's like if i got the DAS The bed. Don't you find it's squeaking more than before ? What time do you start tomorrow ? I leave at 9 am. Good night Good night It's Friday 13th today ! You didn't forget, the 3rd and last of the year ! Lucky charm for some or bad luck for others Anyway without doubt, the day of all superstitions In Tours, superstitious or not, Olivier Bertrand, Pascal Cheny. The "Residence du Lac" and its twin tower, the "belvedere", the best in the 60's can scare any paraskevidekatriaphobic That is to say, people afraid of the 13 Because here, not only the 13th floord exists Not like in these buildings where we move from the 12th to the 14th floor But moreover, at the 13th floor, all apartments are inhabited There some people who don't want to live at the 13th floor they're afraid of the number It is associated with misfortunes When i push the 13 in the lift sometimes people tell me : "Aren't you scared ?" Are you ok ? Yes, yes. Are you alright Daddy ? Yes, yes. Of course i'm fine. You didn't go to work ? No, but i'm working on Saturday. And like every time they told me at the last moment. You went shopping ? Yes ! I told you yesterday ! You already forgot ? No, no. Of course i remember. By the way Daddy, i bought the light i wanted. It's good. What do you do this afternoon Peter? I'll go to the town all to look for a work Hey ! Anna, you went into my room ! No ! It's not true ! -Yes. See it's opened ! - Calm down ! Stop now, it's ok ! Darling, i go around. For how long ? One hour maximum Ok He's always provoking me ! It's annoying ! Hi ! Hello ! Hello ! Hello ! I always thought that suicide required courage but also luck We don't count missed suicides because of bad luck Some of these desperates see by cowardice a divine sign telling them the futility of their acting out It won't be my case. One of the few qualities people recognize in me, is my professionalism. I always achieved all the works i undertook. At work or in my private life. As a child, for example, i always finished my plate. Hey ! Emma ! Wait for me ! - Children ! Be careful it's dangerous here ! - My balloon ! If there wasn't my children, it would be a long time i would have done it ! If there wasn't my children, it would be a long time we would have done it ! Collective suicide. We do it. But gently. So that they do not realize it. With remorse. With memories above all. From when we were children, ourself. From when we were childish. I'm dead I'm dead I'm dead I never did sport Because i don't like to loose I started biking because i had cholesterol The clothe, i had if for the Father's Day Oh, i got used to it Physical activity concerns people who take care of themselves People who wish to delay the fate But, what is the point to delay a not interesting fate ? When we get older, it's a bit egoist to hang on to life like this, isn't ? We don't offer anything anymore to the market economy Instead of this, we pollute, we occupy a housing, we struggle along. But what... It's curious, I feel like I've already been there I remember these stones, this tree I remember having thought at this moment when i walked close to this tree, i thought to a childhood memory Close to my parent's house, there was a tree with the same shape And close to a stone there was a box in rubber embedded in the earth It was scaring me, because i was imaging thousand things about it How can you face life when you're already afraid of a box in rubber ? Hello ! France Telecom assistance, what can i do for you ? Can i have your customer account number please ? Can you confirm your name, surname and address please ? Yes, Madam. I confirm you have an internet access 24h/24 7d/7 It's unlimited. There's no problem. I wish you a nice day from France Telecom assistance Ok, goodbye Madam ! Can i do a break please ? Hello ! France Telecom assistance, what can i do for you ? Can i have your customer account number please ? Listen to me Sir, it's not necessary to be insulting, i'm trying to do my work I'll see if i can get you a manager I've liked my work I nearly enjoyed going at work For a guy like me it was nearly desperate I never thought i would enjoy going at work I got to the idea of a nice little life like most of people I got at last to put this in the skull Peaceful in family, peaceful at work, peaceful in my head It was ok for me like this I even managed to like my colleagues Me who didn't like friendship I smiled at office jokes In short, a miracle And all of this collapsed the "too full" the "too empty" The same shadow as when i was 10 When i was going to play football behind the church Same frail shoulders, same fragile thoracic cage Same thick thighs All these years, all these events, these people To finish like them, alone under the sun ? Weak, nothing, a bird A walking bird Or rather a homing pigeon With a coded message Hooked to the paw That i never could decipher Too complex But it's here. Some girls maybe could have deciphered it. My wife, at the beginning, my children, never A homing pigeon which doesn't know how to fly Walking, arriving after the battle His message is old, too old I'm thirsty Sir ! You mustn't drink the water of the swimming pool. It's not drinkable ! I don't care, i'm dead ! Finally peaceful ! No more accountability. Obsolete I'm 56 and i'm obsolete. 56 years. My grandfather's age when i was 7 Before we were an old man, we were waiting for retirement You were not asked to achieve goals and exceed them You were not asked to be always attractive, to be dressed as a youngster To be a manly man To still fuck To do sport To eat balanced To love his wife as on the first day To be the best friend of his children You were not asked to be creative To have humor And passions You were lucky, old man ! You had the right to be only an old man Me becoming like you, i became a poor guy Obsolete Thrown How did it happen ? I don't know. It happened step by step In nowadays life, there aren't more young, strong and handsome people than in your time ? If you count there are even less But TV became normality Thus everyone became unhappy ? Unhappy to be like one is ? It's messed up We are here now, old man Maybe we'll see each other soon ? It would be funny to see each other at the same age. Two old men When I married with you I was proud I never really told you but i didn't meet many women Physical love did not count for me Especially since after every enjoyment I fell into a black hole I always wanted to die after having fucked Like many men i guess Extreme weariness On the other hand I always appreciated the company of women The one who likes watching women never really gets bored And i met you Even if couple life never attracted me Being single was beginning to weigh me And I was sure that with you all my silences would be understood I knew that life would be gentle I never cheated on you I lost my freedom but i won peace You want to know why i left ? It's simple I feel like I've reached the end, the end of the road facing a wall, to be a hamster in a wheel I didn't know where i was going The work harassed me Our debts encircled us Our daily life was softening us, our friends tired us Our meals became bland Our holidays saddened us Our leisure time bored us Our children left us outmoded Finally, there it is I reached the end of my way Without hope Without animosity Without regret Children, Dad is gone For you it's an amazing luck You will no longer see dad in front of the TV You will no longer see dad looking sad because he has no more cigarette You will no longer see dad drunk Having the elbow ripping on the table You will no longer see dad smelling his socks You will no longer see dad falling asleep in the middle of the day Or getting excited because of the time change You will no longer see dad avoiding confrontation You will no longer see dad going away at the homework time You will no longer see dad turning off the light You will no longer see dad locking himself in the toilets to be peaceful You will no longer see dad going biking to escape I couldn't bear to fear your future I couldn't bear my weakness I couldn't bear your indifference I couldn't bear myself Don't be afraid A dead father is much better than a father without life What can happen in the world at this moment ? I absolutely don't care Welcome home ! There's something important i forgot to tell you I surfed on pornographic sites when you were at the hospital for your fibroma Forgive me The first drawings all represent animals In order to scare children i guess ? And moreover to teach them how to kill them Wonderful drawings Because they observed these animals with fear and respect 4000 years later i don't know how to make fire, even how to draw a beef And i even don't know how looks my predator, the lung cancer What explains that I get hard ? From Playboy to Youporn nothing changed, Neither she nor me It is vertiginous as automatism Even a branch makes me hard Beautiful black diver Life must be intoxicating ! Life must be intoxicating ! Saying that the earthmen walked on this stone It's crazy ! With huge overalls To hold out in this hostile environment And if our record was this ? A huge overhall one gave us to survive on earth ? Something heavy, encumbering us, and letting us survive One sent me from the country of dreams to walk on earth Paul, you definitely talk too much And you don't suicide enough Hello Sir, Would you like to play a game of small runners ? You went out, there Limit My turn The end is close. It's here. Yes, it's here Ah ! You won, bravo. - So, you enjoyed ? - Yes, it wasn't bad. The ground was quite tough. - It's the first time you play to the bikers ? - Yes Oh, me i sometimes play to the bikers - We'll do another one - Yes, yes ! - Are you here everyday ? - Yes Me too, i'm here On the afternoon, i walk here. It's beautiful, isn't it ? No, not really You don't find ? We feel good here, isn't it ? No, not really - Peaceful ? - Yes, very - It's freedom, isn't it ? If you wish Let's play to the goatee ! We play one more time ? I don't know ! It's at this moment i went wrong I always took everything too seriously I forgot to play, suffered the others While it was perhaps enough to take this life for what it is? A part of balls between two voids Hello Paul ! Who is it ? A friend Are you pretty ? Aren't you the virgin Mary, or this kind of divinity ? You believe you're dead, isn't ? Hum, yes. It's good No Paul, it's not the moment already You know, it's not so easy to die Well, i know. It's been two days i can't achieve it And then ! One can believe you're not ready I see too much love in you Love in me ? You don't love yourself so you can't see it But me i see it And i only see it Who are you ? One calls me "endorphin" "Endorphin" ? I hate my hesitations you know ? Always struggling to make decisions Choosing makes me sick I have a clear opinion about it For me it's always the last one to talk who's right Here's ok, i'm alone It's me who talks last But as i never know if i'm right, i stay confused I'm confused Completely confused Tragically confused I don't feel good, you know ? At last, i get a little better I believe Nature is finally not interesting When we're there alone, we don't stop thinking of the moment when we're not there We carry our memory of the city And when we are in group, there is no benefit, like in all groups But since the beginning of my stay here, i still felt some benefits The relative purity of the air, the soothing silence But soon I felt the deficiencies of this environment Modern man simply needs comfort He didn't strived to invent since a long time so many things, for not using them The bed, not for sleepingon the floor Running water to avoid going to the well The central heating so as not to be cold, the supermarket to no longer cultivate oneself The car, not for walking anymore Finally, all these discoveries which no longer oblige the human being to live like me at this moment I confess my mistake, my mistakes Yes, it's stupid. If i don't like people, i like the noise they make And to stay on earth, it may as well be in good conditions I have to say i have always been very rigorous and even autocratic at the bottom of my sofa To be well seated is essential to me That's why i never go to theater for example It is simple I can not stand the hardness of the stones of this region anymore I can no longer stand the sharpness of nature My body claims leather fleece And you, Sun ? Of course you find yourself beautiful Go to sleep ! I feel like Ayrton Senna at the beginning of Imola, on the 1st May 1994 I remember, i was watching the Grand Prize with an absent-minded eye I was drinking a 1664 He was livid He knew The day before a pilot had died during the tests It was too late to leave the race The fate was underway The world was accomplice Are you ok, Sir ? Are you ok ? Are you sure ? You want me to take you somewhere ? Where are you going like this ? It's the whole problem If i take you to the next village, it will be ok for you ? Is the bouquet for your lover ? It's nice to be in love I mean at your age What is your sign ? I admit you tricked me ! Will you stay with me "endorphin" ? Yes, but not for a long time Not more than some minutes What a pity, the flowers were for you Oh, you ! You're really kind I'll remember you Paul Fly far away from these morbid miasma Go purify yourself in the upper air And drink like a pure and divine liqueur, the clear fire that fills the limpid spaces Behind the troubles and the vast sorrows which load the foggy existence with their weight Happy the one who can with a vigorous wing, soar towards the luminous and serene fields The one whose thoughts as the larks, in the skies in the morning, take a free flight, who hangs over life, and easily understands the language of flowers and dumb things.
