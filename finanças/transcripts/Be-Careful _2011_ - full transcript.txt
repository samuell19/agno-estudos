Anjali. Kiran. You're upset and at your mother's place. I keep talking to your photograph. There is something missing in the photograph. If there was a sandalwood garland on this.. That would've been so nice. I would be free. You went away hanging my freedom. Now I don't even give a look to any girl. - Whenever I look.. I keep staring at them as my mother and sister-in-law. I don't like the relation of sisters. It's very sensitive. Trust me at least now. I'm a changed man now. I've become that. For other girls. I've been transformed. I don't know what I was before.

Mary Lele(I'm all yours) - Oh, really? My pleasure. Leave me! What are you doing! - Relax. It has become so hard for simple girls to work. Sam, look she is so simple and innocent. How did you misbehave with her? Ask her what she told me. What did you tell him? - Mary Lele. You heard that? You said it so simply. He doesn't know how to behave. You should've told me. - Both of you are perverts. And my name is Mary. And my husband's name is Ramakant Lele. - Oh. I don't want your job. Thank you. "Baby.." Yahoo! I want to drink. I want to drink. I want to drink. I want to drink. Andy, can't you do anything on your own? You're after me. - Its not Andy. It's a police raid. Run! Police. Move. I want to drink. I want to drink. I want to drink. Do something as per your wish. Are you going to do everything with my permission? Police raid. Run. Police. Get off. She is such a pile on. No. Later. Later. Come on, pal. Police. Wear it later. Let me wear it. Hurry up. Uncle, you? - Darn you. What uncle? Sir, he meant sir. I arrest both of you for womanizing. Sir, us. - Sir, what are you saying? Both of us are married. - Sir, we have little kids. He is lying. - Mishra. Mishra. - Not Mishra. Call me Mishra, the detective. Detective? - They don't have any kids. His wife's name is Anjali. And his wife's name is Kiran. Because of your sins, your fathers.. ..have sent me here as the detective. At your wives' behest. At our wives' behest. Mishra, I'll kill you. - Stop. Stop. Leave me. Save yourself first. Your fathers are waiting for you with your wives at home. We're done for. Both of them must be shot. Go ahead. I don't have a revolver. Look, Malhotra, the ones who are obsessed with having affairs.. ..after marriage can't be changed with force or punishment. Then how do I change both of them? Think. - See. See. My daughter-in-law has become so thin. You see. Now even uncle is making fun of me. Papa. - No, dear. I'm not making fun. You've actually become so thin. I've become this thin because of Andy. Yes, papa. You'll have to do something about them. Or I'll also become thin like Kiran. No. No. No, dear. Not like Kiran. Not like Kiran. How much thinner do I get? Don't cry. Trust me. From today, consider me your father and not father-in-law. But we'll have to change these two perverts, right? So the decision we've made will be best suited. Announce it. Both of us have decided that from today.. ..these two will not be our daughters-in-law but our daughters. And they'll not just be daughters. They'll be your bosses too. You'll have to work as managers under them. Not as managers. But as PAs. They'll have to work at a lower position if there is one. Peon. Peon. - Peon. What are you looking at? This is your dress from today. You two aren't playboys, but businessmen from today. Come on, Kiran. Let us go by your car today. - Yes. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Good morning. Sit. Sit. These are not your bosses. What is he saying! - They are your bosses. Yes. - Kiran. We are the bosses. Mission accomplished. Mishra. - Yes. Where are the rest of her clothes? Hers. - Yes. They have them. - Us? Hello. Where to? Joggers park. - Why? To have a jog. - There is such a big bungalow and such a big lawn. It is just for show. Come on. Do jogging here. There is no need to come there and flirt. No. Go straight to office. Okay. My car? - This is your car. And Mahadev? And this is your new driver. And listen, don't try to buy him, Sam. He has already been bought. Excuse me. - Oh. Please. Mishra, what's happening? Excuse me. Mishra. - Yes, ma'am? Check every expense more than a thousand. Call the number he has spoken to for more than five minutes. Not thousand, ma'am. Every minute will be accounted for. Yes, sir. What will you have, sir? What do we have now? What a drab life! This life is not worth living. Get a bottle of poison. Poison. That's not available here, sir. Shall I get it from outside? Get two black labels. Go. - Thank you, sir. Idiot. Pal, tell me something. What is the easiest way to commit suicide? The easiest way to commit suicide.. I wonder what you heard. I wonder what I said. Supplier, you? Don't call me supplier. I have a name. R.K. Tiwari. Ram Khilavan. - Tiwari. Yes. - So you supply garments to our company, right? So will you make me your family's launderer? I do supply. But right now, I'm having fun. And getting high. And tell me. Who among you wants to die? Me. - Me. Both of us. - Oh. Reason? Our wives have made our lives hellacious. They've made your lives hell, so you want to die because of them? Yes. Mr. Tiwari, are you married? Yes. Why? - Is sister-in-law blind? Why would she be blind? What happened? Doesn't ever doubt you? - No. In fact she gives me chances. Do something. Do something. So why don't you do something? No. - You are pretending to be a gentleman, Mr. supplier. Idiot, the ones who are worthless are gentlemen. So we're in no way gentlemen. So that's good. Keep your wives under your thumb. How? - You wear the pants. Haven't you heard the saying? A witch never hunts in her own backyard. Look at me, I play the game of love abroad. Well done, son. You're cheating on sister-in-law. What cheating? Bangkok. - Bangkok. Bangkok. - Thailand's Bangkok. - Obviously. Our Bangkok. - My Bangkok. I've a small office there. But I do big things there. Do you supply things there too? No. The office is locked. I've had over 100 affairs there in Bangkok. Over a 100. - Yes. Andy, it's not a bad idea. - Certainly. It's a dangerous idea. Yes. Our wives have turned us into managers recently. We'll become beggars if they fire us. Let us go. - Tiwari to the rescue. Sit. No fear when Tiwari is here. Tell me. Shall I fix someone for you? Tell me quickly. Hello. What does he say? What is he thinking? It's a yes from him. - And you? Now since he has agreed, it's a yes from me too. Good morning. The phone has been ringing since so long. Why don't you pick it up? It must be someone from the office. You pick it up. Just tell them I am busy. Okay. Hello. - Hello. This is Lobo from Bangkok. - Yes. Yes. Yes. - Yes. Yes. It's some Mr. Lobo from Bangkok. He wants to talk to you about business. We're not able to finish India's orders. So why bother about Bangkok? Let it be. What.. What did you just do? You should expand your business. This will make papa also happy. Hello. - What happened? Is the connection not proper? - Yes. Yes. One second. Here. It's him. Speak to him. Speak to him. Yes, Mr. Lobo? It's not Lobo, this is Tiwari. - What do you want? I just want you to go to Bangkok and have fun. - Say yes. I just want to fulfill your desire. Are you coming or no? Say yes. - Yes. Yes. - Yes. You're saying as if your wife is besides you in a gown. - Yes. One day you guys will die thanks to your wives. Yes. Yes. - What yes. What are you doing? Here. Give it to me. - Look, as long as Tiwari is there.. Tiwari? Hello. Sister-in-law, actually I have a lousy servant name Tiwari. How come you have a servant named Tiwari since you're Lobo? Sister-in-law, I wanted Bachchan. But I found Tiwari by mistake. So I hired him. Have I made a mistake? Okay. Anyways, Mr. Chetan. Lobo. Sam will certainly do business with you. There is just one condition. - Tell me. Bangkok. My husband. Sister-in-law, trust me. I'll bring him back in 15-20 days once the work is done. The job will be done in just 15 days? Sister-in-law, their desire to work will never end. But I'll make them go through at least 15-20 files. I swear. Thank you. You're so wise. This is what my wife used to say. I mean still does. I'm definitely sending my husband to you. Bye. - Same, same, sister-in-law. I won't go. - Why? What happened? I'll get bored there alone. - Why alone? Andy is your partner. Take him along. Ever since you've got him caught red handed.. ..he hasn't been himself. She is scared of his wife. Look, don't worry. I'll convince Kiran. She'll give him the permission. Hello. Yes, Kiran, listen. Yes. "One, two, three, four.." The fun begins now. - We're in Bangkok. How come he died? Sir. Sir. - Bangkok has been built for people like us. Hello, sir. - You're speaking Hindi Sir. - Come. Sir, I'm from Nepal. So I can obviously speak Hindi. So drop us to our rooms at least. - Sir. Sir, actually.. Sir, actually, I have some work to do. Why? - Well, actually, Syria's king is dead. Syria's king is dead. Yes, sir. Syria's king is dead. How did you come to know? - Sir, I got a call. Syria's king is dead. And you got a call. - Why? Sir, I mean a chick. I mean chick. A chick is dead. - Right, sir. Sir, I'll go and speak. Sir, you go ahead. - Go. Go. I'll come and join you, sir. - Let him go. How did it die? - Let us do some chick hunting. What kind of chick do we look for? - Listen properly. I want everything to be clean. Look at this. What is this? Move. 431. Four people. One room. This is sheer injustice. Sheer injustice. Sir, but it's just the two of you. There will be two girls as well. Breakfast. Lunch. - Dinner. Go through the rules of this place, sir. - Rules? No drinking. No Gemini allowed. But we are not Gemini. Girls are not allowed. - Oh no! Third one. Why have they built a hotel? They should've built an ashram. By the way, who is this so called great Pandit? Where can we meet him? Here. - Oh. That's me. I'm Dr. Sachidanand Brijmohan Pandit. I'm the manager of this place. Hello. You're an Indian, so speak simple Hindi. So that we can understand. And so that you don't have to explain it again and again. - Yes. Okay. I mean fine. You read the rules? - Yes. - Yes. As such, three warnings are given. But here you'll get just two warnings. The third time, your bags will be sent to the airport. And a board bearing rejected will be put all over you. And no taxi or ride will take you to the airport. You'll have to go on foot. And the guest thrown out of this hotel.. ..cannot check into any hotel in Thailand. This is the reputation we have. All that is fine. But the manager of a five star hotel should be educated. And you are a pundit. Pandit is my surname. And I've got a MA degree in Hindi from Benaras university. MA in Hindi. Why? Isn't a man who has studied in Hindi educated? Yes. He is. But.. English is not education. It is a language. Anyone can say A for apple. B for Banana. But learning what vitamins apple and banana have.. ..and which part of the body they affect is education. Education teaches unity. And language causes discrimination. Got it? Wow! What a speech! If you can understand, this is the main mantra of life. And it's a speech if you can't. Send their bags to their room. Yes, sir. - We'll meet. Again and again. Bye. He is so boring, pal. He has pursued a hotel managing course. So he'll obviously be boring. Room number seven is done. Bahadur. - Sir. Sir, I was looking for you over there. - Tell me one thing. Ask me two things, sir. What is this Pandit all about? Sir, forget the Pandit. Sir, tell me something. You have come for 'Moza'(Socks), right? - 'Moza'? Hey, hosiery shop. Don't we find 'Moza' in India that we'd come here for that? - 'Moza'? Sir, not 'Moza' but 'Maza'(Fun). Not socks I meant fun. Sir, just a little bit of fun with the girls. Fun is what we are here for. But this Pandit has become the spoilsport. Sir. Sir, you can't have fun here as long as Pandit is here. So where will we find chicks? I know, sir. I'll tell you, sir. - Bahadur, you are my man. I am a man absolutely. Sir, I do my duty like a man. I am on the job all the time. Sir, it's not that. - Here. This is for you. Sir, I don't want money. - Sam.. What happened?My card. My money. You keep acting all the time. - I'm not acting, pal. They were in it. The purse seems to be new. There is nothing in it. It's not a new purse. It's my old purse. - What is this paper? What's written? - We've booked the hotel room. You'll get the rest of the information in a while. Friend. - My darling. Sir. Sir, I understood everything. Sir, you keep this. What is this? Rascal. What is this? Sir, this is a tip for you from me. - You dared to give me a tip? Who do you think you are? Sir.. - Get lost from here. We have been ruined. All thanks to your Anjali. Don't consider Kiran to be so innocent. She used her brains more and her mouth less. That's right. I never realized when she took the money.. ..and credit card out of my purse. What do we do now? - Very simple. We'll pack our bags and leave, Robert. But where will we go? - Tiwari will come to our rescue. He has given us the idea to come here. Good idea. Just a minute. Hello. - Are you there? Where? - This is Anjali. Yes. We've reached, baby. How did you like the hotel? Great. Mind blowing. Darling, shall I tell you one more mind blowing thing? Yes. Tell me. - There is a surprise. I'm used to your surprises now. Then come to the reception quickly. Because we are waiting for you. - Come on, run. Are you running or jogging? Why are you running? Is there a fire? There has been a bomb blast. - Is Osama here? Not Osama. But two mummies of Osama are here. Osama has two mummies. Come on. Our wives are waiting at the reception. - What! Where are you going? - To the sea. It's better I drown in the sea than dying there. Come on. Let us face the trouble and die. - No. Excuse me. - Yes. Two ladies must have come here. Where are they? No one has come here. - Are you speaking the truth? Darn it! - In fact, no one has come here in the last 15 minutes. Who is calling? - Kiran. Then pick it up. Hello. - Where are both of you? In India? - In India. What are you saying! - In India. Did you like our surprise? So it was a joke? - Yes. Thank God. - What? I mean, I almost got a heart attack. We. - We. Heart attack? Your cholesterol level has increased? Anjali said both of you have come here. We were so happy that we were going to get a heart attack. Thank God we didn't come. Why did she call up? Why did she call up? - But.. Why did you call up? To tell you that we know your room number. You know our room number? And we will be calling you up every hour. Okay, darling? - Okay. Okay, darling. Bye. Poor guys must be wondering what kind of wives they have got. Anjali and Kiran have put us in a fix. Now, what will happen? We can't even stay in this hotel. We can't even do anything. - We will have to go back. If you make a mistake, you will have to go back. You remember the two warnings, don't you? The third is the return ticket. Bye. Let me go. We would have managed to fool Kiran and Anjali. How will we fool him? 'Panditji.' This is the final warning, my friends. After this, straight to the airport. I will make you Rakhi Sawant of All India Radio. Yes. Tell her not to kiss me. The movie has not been made. You will kiss me and make my plight bad. A match made in heaven. One is blind. And the other.. Mr. Tiwari, if there is heaven, it's here. And nowhere else. Girls. Girls. From India. Gorgeous. - I was thinking about you. Do you even miss us here, Mr. Tiwari? I have to. Mr. Tiwari, you are sitting here? What else? Do you see me on a tree? Tell me. Did something happen? Or nothing? Nothing. - Not at all, Mr. Tiwari. The hotel where we are staying, we can't do anything there. Which? In which hotel are you staying? The waiter was saying, "Fairy Dream Hotel." How did you go to Fairy Dream? There, even your dreams are clean. Both of you are staying in children's film society. His wife made the arrangements. My wife? - Yes. What else? His wife knows he is a flirt. Flirt. From India. Will you just give our introduction? Or will you do something? Please. - I will do something. Do something. - Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. - Tell him. Please tell. I will do something. - Tell him to do. Control him. Come. Let's talk. Yes. Girlfriends are not allowed in your hotel. But wives are allowed. You are telling us to call the nuisance whom we have left behind. Forget it. Come. It's not his cup of tea. Come. - What? What come? When Tiwari is there, there is no ailment. I am not talking about your actual wives. So? - So? - So.. Fake wives. You remember who you are, don't you? - Yes. Kiran. When network is slow, downloading takes time. What kind of girls has Tiwari given us? You explain to them. Listen to me carefully. You are Anjali. His wife. And you are Kiran. - Okay. My wife. Another thing. You won't open your mouth in front of Pandit. Okay? - Okay. Come on. - Okay. Sir. Hello. - Bahadur, how are you? Sir, great. Sir, you came suddenly. Bahadur, my wife. Hello. - She is my wife. Hello. - Hello. Sir, you came suddenly. They gave us a surprise. What to do? Surprise? - That's it. Sir. I also have a surprise for you, sir. What are you saying? - Yes, sir. Better than them? - Of course, sir. Sir. Mr. Lobo wants to talk to you, sir. Who is Lobo? - Lobo? Lobo. Tiwari. Tiwari. Lobo. Tiwari. What? - Yes. - Sir, Lobo is everywhere. He is here. Sir. You sniff and recognize a person? He is Lobo? - How did he become Lobo? He is Lobo? I am Lobo. I am Lobo. Lobo. My parents named me Lobo. - What happened to Tiwari? There was a grand feast in Goa when I was born. Do you know? 100 pigs were slaughtered. Why are you staring at me? Are you Sammy? - Yes. Are you Andy? - Yes. - I am Lobo. I am Bahadur. They are their wives. - They are not their wives. How does he know? How does he know they are not our wives? You said so. I will just call up his wife. - No. No. No, sir. - You are Lobo. You are Lobo, sir. - Yes. Of course. We have come to do business with you. That's good. Good. Good. Very good. Very good. Yes. I don't know what business you do. But I will give you my business card. Take this. We will meet tomorrow in the office to discuss the business. Okay? - Yes, sir. Bye. See you. - Not their wives? They are not their wives. I know. They are somebody's wives. What new trouble is this? Your wife has created this trouble. You are responsible for this. You. How did he come? - Like this. What have you done? Who was he? - He was your wife's sycophant. He had come here to spy on us. If Anjali has sent him, we will surely get into trouble. Not get into trouble. You have already got into trouble. Who are these two girls? My wife. - My wife. Who was the girl in India with whom you spoke just now? How did he find out? You interfere a lot. We have paid you for the hotel, haven't we? Now, we will do whatever we want. - We will do it. You will do whatever you want. First Anjali and Kiran will do something. Go and clean the hotel's bathroom. Have you seen your face? Why are you envious if we have got the girl? You couldn't entice a girl. And you are feeling envious. Do you know who can entice girls? - No. No. Boys like us. Smart. - Handsome. Dashing. - Awesome. Awesome. Did you hear? Awesome. Did you hear? Did you hear? - You are zero. No. You are a firecracker. I will light you. But you will still not burst. Do you know? He is crazy. What.. - Sir. What have you done, sir? - Why? You shouldn't have locked horns with him, sir. Pandit? Why shouldn't we lock horns with him? Sir, he is a dangerous man. Sir, do you know? When he laughs, it means he is angry, sir. He is a crazy man, sir. Do you know, sir? If he loses his temper.. - What will he do? What will he do? Do you know him, sir? He is a dangerous man, sir. - Pandit? Sir, you have come here to have fun, right? - Yes. Yes. - So have fun, sir. Sir, I will tell you where you can have fun. "My heart beats fast, beloved." "My heart beats fast." "Tell me you love me again and again." "My heart beats fast, beloved." "My heart beats fast."

She is mine. Let's toss. Heads I win. Tails she is yours. Not toss. Let's try. If you win, she is yours. If I win, she is mine. "Come to me." "My love searches for love." "Hold my breath."

She waved. - Yes. 'Panditji.' 'Panditji.' She is my would-be wife Kavita. People call me poem affectionately. What did both of you say? You need style to entice a girl. You need handsome, smart looks. Now who is handsome and smart? Both of you or me? What did both of you say? Forget a hot girl. Try to entice an ordinary girl. Isn't she hot? Aren't both of you ordinary? Now, both of you will clean the bathroom as a sweeper. Isn't this what both of you had said? To find love you need sweet words and brains. I have it. I waive your fees. Remember this poem. Bye. Not Kavita. Poem. - 'Panditji.' Even in school I couldn't memorize poems. Forget this poem. We can't even read it, leave alone memorizing it. What are you saying? It's very simple. Rape the girl. - Yes. Then rescue. - Whom? You or the girl? It is a very old filmy formula. Darling, old is gold. We are Indians at heart. If both of them are approving.. ..it must be a fantastic formula. Shut up! You should look like a very dangerous villain. I will come in the get up of such a villain.. ..the girl herself will say, "Rape me! Rape me!" You know I have played the roles of so many villains in college. Narad, Kans.. and what was his name? You must have played Surpnakha's role too. Yes, they didn't release the drama 'Surpnakha' at all. But this is not a drama but a reality. Mr. Pandit's men will be present there too. Will I have to rape Mr. Pandit's men too? What if you get raped instead? I am not afraid of being raped. Yes. Your sister-in-law is saying, what if Mr. Pandit.. ..tries to interfere in the game too? Isn't it a matter to think? That's what I am saying. Give him a few of the short-time kicks. He will flee from there. All right. Then watch the magic of Amitabh from Agnipath. Oh, darn! - Which is this corrupted Government? This is rehearsal. I will play such a solid role of Amitabh Bachchan in live telecast.. ..Mrs. Jaya will also say.. .."Hello, brother. What is the purpose of your visit?" Thank you. Hey, do you know? What? - Get up. Why? Don't ask why, because I am the don of this city. Right? - Wah-Wah! So what should I do? Wah-Wah! It's me who has to do it. What do you have to do? My name is Vijay Dinanath Tiwari. It is your turn to be raped today. Why, Tiwari? Did you drink the whole bottle of whisky in the morning? Have you gone crazy? - So you are calling me crazy? I am the don of Bangkok. Wherever I go the parents of girls say.. .."Go inside or Tiwari will come." And these three scoundrels.. - Wah-Wah! Get out you Wah-Wah! So you are telling Vijay Dinanath Tiwari to get out? You will come to know. You will come to know right now. I think you won't listen so easily. Hold on a minute. Don't threaten me. I am the don. No one can insist before a don. - Wah-Wah. You have not come to attend a discourse. A rape scene is going on here. Why are you praising me? Where have they both gone? I will have a big problem while raping you here in the lounge. Come on, let's go home. Let's go to my house. Come on. Leave me! Leave me! - Come on, pick her up. Help me! - What? - Help me! You have an appointment with rape for 15 minutes. You are coming with me for 15 minutes. 'Panditji.' Hello! What's going on? Hello. I am telling sister to come along. I will rape her and drop her back in two minutes. But she is not ready. Look, Mister! Who? Me? - Yes. I am giving you respect. Wow! I can't digest so much respect. You know? You know? She is my would-be wife and we are going to marry. You keep on marrying her. I will rape her and drop her back within five minutes. This is wrong! What say? - Wah-Wah! Shut up! - Wah-Wah! Come on! - Look, I beg of you, please leave her. This is wrong! - Mr. Pandit, I beg of you to marry. Do get married. I will just rape her and drop her back within five minutes. Why don't you understand? What the hell! - Wah-Wah! What a husband you have chosen! You know, choose such a husband.. ..who allows you to go out for 12-14 minutes. Hey? What is he doing? Oh! So he will fight? With Dinanath Tiwari Vijay? Come on, dude! Hey, he has turned into a crab! Hey, Mr. Pandit! Mr. Pandit! Stop it! First you called him and now you are hitting him? This whole drama was planned by him! Yes, he had called up at 7:30 and told me to rape her. Tell me, didn't you call me? - I'll kill you! Hey, didn't you call him? You said that. I did. - Mr. Pandit, I thought you are a good man. No, no. - But you are a fraud and an imposter! - Hey, but.. He had made this plan to raise his status in your sight. It was his plan. - Thank God, you opened my eyes. Thank you. I don't want to see your face again. - But.. Guru, you never declared the idea of Kung-fu. - I'll kill you! Mr. Pandit, have you come to wish us good morning so early? Fantastic! - No, no. I have come to bid goodbye to you. Goodbye? - Yes. I accept that both of you are love-gurus. I will go to India and find a good girl for myself. Kavita was not fit for me. - Yes. You have said a sensible thing for the first time. No, no, I have become very wise now. I have learnt a lesson in the world about how I should live. I will bring a change in myself. So we will not meet again, right? No, if I return soon.. - Who will return? If I will return early, we will meet. - Oh! Otherwise goodbye forever. We have got rid of the obstacle. "So begins our love technology." "It is the astrology of my heart."

What is this nonsense? What are you blabbering, Bahadur? Bahadur? - Yes. You know my name but how come I don't recognize you? Who are you? Oh, Mr. Pandit! - Hey, not Pandit, only Pants! Only Pands! I have changed my get up too with my name, Bahadur. Sir, you have totally changed. Your bike's color has changed and so has yours, sir. Your hair has changed too. It seems like.. ..the cactus of the desert, sir. Sir, you are looking 'Kamaal' (Amazing). - Who Komal? Mr. Pandit, amazing. - Komal.. I mean amazing! - Oh, oh! You are looking wonderful, sir. I will definitely look wonderful now, Bahadur. - Yes, sir. I have to prove to those two smart, dashing.. ..handsome awesome hunks how amazing I am! Where are both of them? Hey, Senorita heart! - Senorita! Hey, bro! Hey, bro! Hey, it's Moghul-E-Azam! He has changed into Eastman color from black and white. She kicked you. I was waiting. Why, Mr. Pandit? Hey, no mister, no Pandit. Only Pands, dude. Pands? - Yes. Both of you are my gurus, right? - Yes. You snatched my girlfriend while trying to change me? From that time I decided to change myself.. ..and I have changed. What did you do after changing? - Did you impress any item girl? Not one, I impressed two item bombs. - Two? She must be of size 13. - Hey. If you will see her it will explode. - What? Your eyes. - Oh, I see! Is she better than Poem? - You keep on reading Poem.. ..I have brought the entire library. But what will you do by impressing two girls? I will marry the girl who is fit for me. Will you marry both of them if they are fit for you? I can marry both of them. Both of you see them once and say who is perfect for me. Which girl do you like? - I find both of them amazing. As their name suggests. What are their names? The name of one girl is Anjali. And the name of the other girl is Kiran. K.. K.. Kiran?! I have called both of them. You have to see who loves me more.. ..so that I can impress her. Has Kiran come too? - What? Yes, Kiran and Anjali, both of them. - What? Yes, dude. Come in. Meet them today. No, no, we will watch them from far. We will recognize them from far too. - Okay. That's right. But don't you want to come in? No, no. - No, we are fine here. Okay, so both of you go and ogle from that corner.. ..as you are used to. - Yes. Okay, come on. - Take a sneak peek. A sneak peek. I am happy. I love you both. I am happy. I am happy. Waiter. I didn't do anything because of you. Otherwise.. - Otherwise what would you have done? Otherwise I would have taught a good lesson to that Pandit. Wretched dwarf talks big things. We will have to use their formula.. ..or we will be reduced to servants. So should we tolerate our insult? Buddy, what else can we do? Yes, we will have to speak to Pandit affectionately. Both of them are jealous. Both of you are my love-gurus. - Yes, its okay. Just tell me who is perfect for me from both these girls. Both of them are inferior. None of them is fit for you. No, tell me who is cheaper? Anjali or Kiran? Anjali. - Kiran. - Anjali. - Kiran. Anjali. - Kiran. Kiran. - Anjali. Anjali. Anjali and Kiran are my girlfriends.. ..so why are both of you fighting and playing finger cricket? Yes, buddy. I am sorry. We had forgotten. So both of you felt for a moment that they are your wives, correct? Yes. You are right. - We think perhaps they are married. What do you mean by perhaps? They are married. What? - Yes. Didn't you find any single girl? I had met Kavita. But both of you snatched her from me. So will you ruin the lives of married women now? No, no, I am prospering it. - Listen to him. And what about their husbands? To hell with their husbands. They flirt in India like rascals. What did you say? - I abused their husbands. You shouldn't abuse anyone's husband like this. I shouldn't abuse their husbands? They were abusing their husbands in a crowded market. They are cheats, frauds, dirty, ugly and miscreants. They don't have any faith or belief. They were saying this about us? - Yes. About us? - Why about you? They were saying about their husbands. About them. About their husbands. - I see. You know, I too didn't like hearing about them. Let me tell you today too. I will get them divorced and if I meet them.. ..I will beat them black and blue. Wretched dirty husbands.. - What should we do now? First we will have to save our family. We should trust our wives. I trust my wife but not this short guy. Both were busy in saving their respective wives. It was such a hilarious scene! If both of you were present there.. ..you would have laughed till you went crazy. - Thank God we.. ..didn't see their faces. - Why? We would have gone crazy. - Oh, God! Crazy. Mr. Pandit. - Yes? Do you think whatever we are doing is right? What wrong are you doing? You should explain to the person in the language he understands. And you are doing that. - Yes. We had decided to give them a divorce on hearing your talks. You have always been his wife. You should have tried to become his girlfriend too. Now both of them will realize that their wives possess.. ..all those qualities which they search in other girls. Thank you, brother. We have come with you till here on this very hope. Mr. Pandit, we should just get back our husbands. That's it. Hello? - Hi, Sam, where are you, dude? In hell. The fun will begin now. - It's better I just called you. If I would have come to meet you.. ..I would have gone to hell with you. Why have you called me? - Buddy, both of them.. ..have invited me to dinner tonight. Now tell me, with whom should I go? With Anjali or Kiran? Or with both of them? - Don't go with either of them. Both are not fit for you. - What? I am not going to cancel the program on your telling. I will definitely go, boss. Okay, listen, if you want to go, then go with Kiran. Really? - Both of you make a perfect match. So according to you, Kiran is best, right? - Yes, Kiran is perfect. I think Andy is with him. And what if she proposes me for marriage? Then marry her as soon as possible. I will finalise everything with Kiran today itself. And tell Kiran to divorce her husband and marry you. Okay, okay. That's fantastic. Sam, so you have saved your wife? What should I do? Will you say the same if he goes out with your wife tomorrow? Have you seen his eyes are so lusty? You are right. That Pandit is starved. We should save our wives, buddy. Look, a wife brings charm at home and not a girlfriend. Understood? See, they are having wives at home.. ..and both of them are roaming outside with their girlfriends. How disgusting! Don't you feel ashamed? Look, now even Tiwari is saying such things.. ..a flirt man like him! Whom did you call a womanizer? No, no, Mr. Tiwari, he didn't mean that. Whom did he call a womanizer? Yes? He meant to say you are a very decent, very sophisticated man. Hey, listen.. I am not so sophisticated. I have given you the proof. Why were you needlessly saying that? Right? He has a habit to talk nonsense. Why did you send Kiran to have dinner with Pandit? What should I do if you don't trust your wife? Couldn't you have sent Anjali? - How can I send her? Hello! Hello! Hello! Are you forgetting our friendship for her sake? - Hello! Friendship! Pandit is a very cheap man. He is a big flirt. He is taking advantage of both the girls.. ..and he is benefiting from it. Both of you will starve to death. Understood? But what should we do now? Go and find out where she is going for dinner. Then? - Then what? Leave the rest to me. Both of you just get scared. I am here. - Really? Don't you understand Hindi? I am here to help you. He's there. He's there. Whatever you say, I really enjoy it. Keep on eating and drinking. Have fun. Love you, darling. Love you too, darling. - Love you, darling. Look, we men are covering our faces.. ..and you wives are getting cozy with him. Mr. Tiwari, talk with manners. They are our wives. So what? They just have to do cabaret with Pandit now. Cabaret? - What should we do now, Mr. Tiwari? What to do? Go and teach him a lesson. Come on, let's go. - Go now. Hey, listen! Hello? It will be great fun. - Half Pant, what's going on? Don't you feel ashamed to eye the wives of others? Vest and brief, whose wives? Anjali is my wife. - And Kiran is my wife. Have you gone crazy? I don't even know you. - I am Sam. Why are both of you forcing us to accept you as our husbands? You have forgotten your Andy? Your Andy? Hey, don't touch her! So we are not your husbands? - Not at all. - Who is he? Mr. Pandit is our would-be.. - Would-be what? Perhaps their would-be husband. Would-be husband. And we? - The bullet shot from a gun which is of no use now. The world is aware, we have taken the wedding rounds.. ..with thousands as witness. And you are still making us take rounds. Say this to your wives. - We are saying this to our wives. What's going on here? - Khujli! My name is Khujli. Inspector Khujli. My name is Khujli like Jaitley, Braitley, Bruce Lee. Has anyone ever mocked at Bruce Lee? If you mock, he will knock you with his martial arts. So, Mr. Pandit, what's up? A new style! A new get up! How are you? - I was fine till now. But they have made my life miserable. What has this pair of Vikram and Baital done? They are claiming them to be their wives. What do these girls say? Mr. Khujli, we don't even know them. We have never met them. So both these girls are your girlfriends, right? - Yes. And both of them are saying they are their wives? Do you have any evidence? - Yes. Who are you? - Yes. Who are you? - He is our witness. - Yes. Of your crime? - Yes. No, no, he knows our wives. Yes, I had attended their wedding. Both of them were wearing veils. I can see their hands and recognize both of them. Do you think the police are fools? Police doesn't see the hands but the face. When you have not seen their faces.. ..why are you being the witness? - He is a liar. All three of them are involved with each other. We are not their wives. Both these girls are denying. Why is it so? Why, sister-in-law, what did you eat? Why are you denying? What do I know why they are denying? If you don't know anything, if you are unaware.. ..why are you needlessly being their witness? Inspector, I know both of them. If you know them, why are you calling them their wives? We don't have time for needless talks. That's what I am saying. This girl in the maroon dress and this piece.. ..of newspaper are their wives, Bencho! - Shut up! This was their name. Pandit is fooling you. Idiot! - What's wrong? When these girls are denying to accept them as their husbands.. ..why are you interfering among them? Were you the priest during their wedding.. ..who chanted the mantras, fool! This donkey runs like a horse. He has gone. - Where? He has run away? - Yes. And they? - They have gone too. So I will go too. - Okay, go. Our plan is successful. Whether the second woman is artificial or real.. ..the wives always hate her. So shall we remarry? He couldn't handle the first, Pandit has snatched her. If you will remarry, the priest will run away with your wife. That too on your motorcycle by stealing the keys from your pocket. I will teach a good lesson to that Pandit.. Pandit has relations with that inspector. Remember? He had thrashed my Switzerland like face so hard.. ..and reduced it into Taliban. The dust was blowing on my face. Dust! Get our wives back to us once. We are ready to do anything for it. - What will you do? Your wives are not ready to recognize you. They are tackling you like street dogs. Dogs. You are right. What is sister-in-law called in Hindi? Forget it. You are the same man who had.. ..run away on getting scared by Pandit, right? That Wah-Wah don, right? No, I didn't want to run. I was standing before him so my legs were shivering. Now you tell her. - Actually he practices Ahimsa. It is his disease. Of course. - He couldn't have hit him. Really? I have this disease too. The whole world is after me and I am after them. You are wearing a green outfit. If you will clash with a Babool tree, the thorns may prick you. If you will clash with dates, you may get something. Saver pack Babool, solve our problem too. Read her. Your problem will be solved. Stop. Stop. Get down. Get down. Carefully. Come on. Come on. Are you ready? - Yes. Now, we have the courage to face anything. No matter what the situation is.. ..we will finish the work for which we have come here. Very good. Very good. - Absolutely. Keep it up. But be careful. Look. Wow! - Yes! While standing. She is Kavita. He is having an affair with her. Darling. - Isn't it too much? It's not much. He is doing all this to make you envious. But you shouldn't feel envious. You have to make him envious. I will teach him a lesson right away. Why? Just now you were telling tall tales. But they are taking advantage of our drama. Where are you going? - I want to see his limit. Take it easy, Kiran. They can't do anything more. They are doing it deliberately. So that we come in front of them.. ..and they find out about our drama. Look, they can't do anything more. Me too. Me too. - You.. Hand. - It's my turn. Look. Come on, baby. Now say it. Endure it. Really. They were very shameless. You were boosting my morale just now, right? The story is not over. The movie is still left. Kiran. Anjali. Listen. Wives can be only wives. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes! Pandit, we thought we will follow your advice.. ..and our husbands will mend their ways. But they are going astray. - Wrong. How did you make a decision so soon? You are strange. They hug a woman in front of us. And you are saying we should tolerate it. No. We have not come here to see their drama. What do both of you want? We want to return to India. Is this your final decision? It's our final decision. Okay. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. The flight will depart at 6:55. If you are late, you will miss it. Come. Why are you waiting? Come. But why are you getting angry? - Yes. What else? I feel as if my marriage is breaking. And I am requesting both of you. Our mind is not working. You tell us. What do we do? Do as I say. Then see the miracle. Fine. Now, our happiness lies in your hands. Yes. That's better. Where are they? By when will they come? They have come. They.. - Hello, sir. I met them at the mall. - Yes. They are the ones. Why have they come to Bangkok? - For business. Why aren't they speaking? They are decent men. They are afraid of the police. Yes. He is right, sir. - Yes. With whom were you going to do business? Who is she? - Me? I am poem. Whose poem? - Sir, his poem. Yes. - His poem? Who was that poem? - Sir, that was ours. Okay. Okay. Yours. Sir, Lobo came that day. We had fixed the meeting for Monday at 11 o'clock. Yes. - Did you have the meeting? Sir, no. - No. Why? - We forgot. - Forgot? Look at this. You came to Bangkok from India for the meeting. And you forgot. Sir, we were a bit busy. With her? - Yes. - No. Did you call up Lobo and say sorry? Yes, sir. - No. What? - No. No, sir. Sir, tell us. What's the matter? After meeting them Mr. Lobo was kidnapped. He is missing for the past eight days. But, sir, what is their connection with it? Yes. What is our connection, Khujli? Khujli? - Not Khujli. You must be wondering that you have to.. ..give respect to a man called Khujli. Sir, what's the matter? Lobo's wife has filed a complaint. She doubts that they have kidnapped her husband. Both of us? We? - Give me something to eat. It got over. Continue. I will order something. Quickly. - Sir, listen to me. I don't take bribe. I eat sandwich. Sir, please listen to us. - No. No. No. At least listen. Tell me. Tell me here. Tell me. Sir, we don't know the Lobo about whom you are talking. So which Lobo do you know? - Our friend. It means, two Lobos? Sir, the Lobo whom we know, he is in Bangkok. He is here, right? - Yes. - Fine. Bring him in front of me. I will be assured when I will see him. And I will release both of you. No. No. No. Once before also I have got into trouble because of both of you. I said no. Then no. Say no. - No. No. - Tiwari, are you afraid? Tiwari will be afraid? Impossible. - No. He is a coward. No. He is pretending. He is a great actor. Is that so? - Yes. In college he had participated in many dramas. Which one? Which one? 'Ek Roti Ke Liye Rape' (Rape for a piece of flatbread). 'Hawas Ke Punjari' (Worshipper of lust). Which was the most famous one? 'Aye Krishna, Tum Kab Sudhroge..' (Krishna, when will you reform). Yes. 'Aye Krishna, Tum Kab Sudhroge'. Did he win any award for acting? Award.. Yes. He won it. Thrice. I got it thrice. It was raining once. - Thrice. It was raining once. - He won it thrice. It won't take you a minute to fool the inspector. You will do it easily. - No. Because I am telling you. The inspector has put me into trouble many times before. Come on. - No. But he is a new inspector. He is new. He has just come. Brand new. - Yes. - Brand new. You will be able to fool him. I can even fool his father, leave alone the inspector. Sir, I am Lobo. - Yes. Who am I? - Lobo. What is it? - Sir, he is Lobo. Why is he lying? - Sir, he had watched a late night show. Tell him to stand. Stand up. Stand up. Why does he watch late night shows? And why is he hiding his face? Sir, you have thrashed me so badly. How many wounds will I hide? You thrash very badly. So he is Lobo? Yes. Yes, sir. - Yes. Yes. He is Lobo. - Yes. Yes? No? What do you mean? Sir, he is Lobo. - Sir, he is Lobo. Sir, he had called us here for business. No. The other day I beat you as Tiwari. Now, you have become Lobo.

My parents gave me this name. Lobo Thomas Tiwari. - Okay. Where is your mother? Is your mother alive? Mother. Mother. Mother. - What's your mother's name? Mother's.. Look, mother's name.

You introduced us to everyone as your wife. So? - So what? What if we tell your wives? Shut up. Okay. Both of you will keep your mouth shut. If you want to silence us, you will have to pay us a price. You think I am a fool? You think I am dim-witted? There will be a problem. If we tell their wives that we are carrying their child. Andy, what is she saying? Remember. Bye. We will have to show them where they stand. Tiwari. - Brother. - Tiwari. Elder brother. Hello, sister-in-law. Supplier. Flirt. - Worshipper of lust.

Save your ears. Why, uncle? - Why? Father had said whenever you are going to be kicked.. ..save your ears first. Why, sister-in-law? Tiwari, why does she beat so much? That's what I don't understand. She doesn't understand my language. I abuse in Hindi. And she thinks I am singing. Do I look so happy? I have a problem. Tiwari sir, we will solve all your problems. Just solve our small problem. That is fine. But will I get rid of this chewing gum? Yes. You will. But.. ..what do I have to do? The girls have come to our hotel. They are claiming to be our wives. And they are saying they are carrying our child. Congratulations, father. - Papa. You fool. You made her pregnant in nine days? Pregnant? We didn't even touch them. If you didn't touch them, how come they are pregnant? It's not our child. That's what you have to come there and say. I know their secret. They are prostitutes. - Yes. I gave them to you for two months. And they want to stay in your life forever. What did sister-in-law say? What did sister-in-law say? Sister-in-law is saying, "Whom did you call sister-in-law?" Well said. Well said. Why are you making the sound of a bell? - There. There. Yes. Hello. - Hello. Where is he? - You are right. Tiwari should have been here until now. - He hasn't arrived yet. Where could he be? - Sam. These girls are coming with some fat guy. Police. Mota Lele. Shut up. Inspector Mota Lele. Pleased to meet you, Inspector. Why do you trouble your wives? Wife? Inspector, they are call girls? Any proof. Any witness? We have proof as well as evidence. Tiwari the Bimari (sickness). Here. I am keeping it on speaker mode. Talk here. This number is permanently unavailable for you two. It's.. permanently.. unavailable. Listen, when I start using my truncheon.. ..I don't know when to stop. If you two trouble your wives again.. ..then I will make things really difficult for you. Come on, darling, let's go somewhere. Leave. Leave me. - Let's go. - Suite? You are behaving as if we haven't been there before? - What? I don't want to go. - I don't want to go with you? - Listen please. What do you want after all? Pardon us. If you want pardon then give us Rs. 2 crores. Rs. 2 crores? Are you crazy? So what? We are only asking for Rs. 2 crores. Rs. 1 crore for her and Rs. 1 crore for me. Where will we get it from? We can't just pluck it from trees? That is your problem. If we don't get the money by tomorrow morning then.. ..we will lodge a complaint in the police station tomorrow again. And your wives will know what you two are doing. Bye, then. - Bye, darling. See you. Bye. - Let's go. What are we stuck in? Our wives are much better. - You are right. Come. "Today we got the time, let's sit face to face." "Let's stay silent and hear the eyes converse." It is entirely my fault? - Then what? - You haven't done anything? If Tiwari hadn't got us into this.. ..then we wouldn't have been in this predicament. Even Anjali can do this? - No. If Kiran hadn't taken your wallet.. ..this would have never happened. It's not just my fault. But we are in trouble now. "Let's stay silent and hear the eyes converse." "We might not get these moments tomorrow.'" "Maybe the ambience won't be this beautiful." "We might not get these moments tomorrow.'" "Maybe the ambience won't be this beautiful." "Today we got the time, let's sit face to face." "The nights are upset." "The days are sad." "Wonder what was the reason.. we parted ways." "Let's forget all the qualms and quarrels." "Come and give me a hug." "We might not get these moments tomorrow.'" "Maybe the ambience won't be this beautiful." "Today we got the time, let's sit face to face." "Let's stay silent and hear the eyes converse." "Loneliness in the heart." "Tears in the eyes." "I wish to see you again." "Says my heart." "These distances are painful." "Come in my arms once again." "We might not get these moments tomorrow.'" "Maybe the ambience won't be this beautiful." "Today we got the time, let's sit face to face." "Let's stay silent and hear the eyes converse." Why are you two so sad? What happened? - We cannot get hold of Tiwari. We tried calling him so many times. Those girls are blackmailing us. They are demanding Rs. 2 crores. We don't know what to do. Even our wives left us. Those girls are after us. Do you know what your problem is? - What? You think Tiwari is your friend. And he is your biggest enemy. He just wants your money. How is that? It's like this. Who brought you to Bangkok? Tiwari. - Tiwari. And who introduced you to the two girls? - Tiwari did. It's simple and straight. So, what can we do? I feel you should meet Pandit and tell him everything. I think he is the only guy who can help you. Why will he help us? - Because he is a nice guy. He is a nice guy, he will surely help you both. Mr. Pandit, please forgive us. - We are in trouble. Mr. Pandit, please take your poem back. Please forgive us, Mr. Pandit. Please, otherwise we will get divorced. Please, please. - Please forgive us. - Please. I see "We will get divorced, Mr. Pandit." I am a midget. Good for nothing. You are smart, dashing, handsome, awesome. How did the ambience change today? Mr. Pandit, please. Sorry. Mr. Pandit, please. You say something. Mr. Pandit, please forgive them. And me too. Please. I will deal with you later. What do you two want? Mr. Pandit, Tiwari had called us to Bangkok posing as Lobo. We are in trouble now. - Please save us. Please. If Tiwari is the bogus Lobo.. ..then let's go see the real Lobo. Lobo. Who Lobo? - You, who else. I am not Lobo. - The other day you came to the hotel.. ..and you said you are Lobo. That Lobo is dead. Don't lie, you are Lobo. I said Lobo is dead. - Why are you saying that? You have killed him. - Us? Why are you getting shocked? My wife was suffering from Aamir Khan's disease. What? She interfered in everything. No. That disease in 'Ghajini'.

Sir, please let us go. - I see. How can we trust someone.. ..who flirts around with other's fianc�? We returned your poem. Poem. - Poem was never yours whom you returned to us. She was fooling you. On my request. - The police troubled you. On my request. But, sir, we don't even know you. Why did you interfere? Unfortunately, your father is my friend. This was our planning. From meeting Tina and Meena.. ..until landing up here in jail, we three were involved.. ..in everything that happened with you both. And when we told Tiwari his wife's truth.. ..then Tiwari fled out of fear. Why don't you two understand.. ..what the inspector is saying? You are just the actors. We are the directors of this drama. Us. But our wives? They have gone to their parent's home. And until you two don't change.. ..they won't come back. Not just your wives but your fathers are also angry.
