[music playing] [music playing] [laughter] [screaming] Go to hell. [laughter] Burn, witch. Here he is. Welcome, little William. Mr. Churchill. Yes. NURSE: Would you like to see your wife and son now? Yes, of course. Oh, god. I'm so excited. This is-- This is Linda Swanson. She's a friend of my wife's. Oh, I'm sorry. Only the immediate family is allowed to see the mother now. Can I lie? I'm not at liberty-- besides, it's going to be so crowded when your wife's family gets here. Uh, my wife doesn't have any family. Isn't there something we can do? It's hospital policy. I'm sorry, Ms. Swanson. Damn. It's all right. I'll wait. If you'll follow me? We've all fallen in love with your wife. She's absolutely adorable. Yes, I feel the same way. And her accent is so cute. She immigrated from Poland with her parents as a child. Oh, that's interesting. -Oh, Mr. Churchill? -Yes. Dr. Adler I'd like to congratulate you. Thank you very much. Nurse, we need you in room 427 stat. I'll be right there. I'll show him to the room. Thanks. Congratulations again. JOHN: Thank you. He's so perfect. Thank you. I am so happy. How are you feeling? I'm OK. I hate to break up the party. He's got to go back to the nursery. I made it. Where is he? Where's the baby? Oh, you just missed him. Oh, shit. You'll just have to stop by the house next week. [sigh]. Who does he look like? His father. His mother. Oh, well. Why, John? I'll be working late every day. I want you to have some help with the baby, and Mother is glad to do it. Yeah. But I won't be comfortable in your mother's home. It'll just be for a week, Grace. Believe me, it will be much easier on you this way, until you get your strength back. Besides, mother will love to have you and the baby. OK. Good. It's settled. Only for a week. Just a week. Your wheels have arrived. Thank you. You're welcome. Good luck. Thanks very much. I'll see you. All right, easy does it. Thanks. You go on inside. I'll get the bags. OK. ELIZABETH: Grace. GRACE: Elizabeth. Grace. I didn't expect you back so soon. How are you, dear? Very well, thank you. Oh, you look radiant. GRACE: Thanks. Come. Let me look at you. Oh, Grace. And this must be our little William. GRACE: Isn't he precious? ELIZABETH: He's adorable. It's like a dream. It's not a dream. It's real. He looks like both his parents. Well, shall we take our little prince up to his nursery? Yes. Shall we go, little William? I've kept the nursery simple. I hope you didn't go to any trouble, Elizabeth. No trouble at all, Grace. Well, here we are. Oh. This is very nice. I want you to be comfortable. Thank you. Oh, may I? Oh, certainly. Oh, so beautiful. So, so, so, so-- JOHN: Grace? Do you want to put the blanket on him? Oh, yes. Thank you. Your first grandchild, Mother. Yes, finally. I think he recognizes me. Oh. Now let me show you to your room, Grace. OK. Oh, it's all right. I've got him. John, don't you think William should sleep in our room? You'll be right down the hall from him. Are you sure it's OK? He'll be fine. Come on. How do you feel? Tired. Mm-hmm. But happy. Good. I love you, John. And I love you. Now, you get some rest. Stay with me. [sigh]. You've been through a lot. You need to get your strength back for William. [knocking] ELIZABETH: I made some tea. Do you think she'd like some? JOHN: Yes, thank you, Mother. Mother made some tea. I was so looking forward to being alone with you. We'll only be here a few days. Until you can get back on your feet. Come on, have some tea. -Ugh. -Now, don't be a baby. I never liked it much, either. But it's good for you. It looks like we have a storm coming. [thunder] All right, a big one now. That's a good girl. All right. Cover up. There we go. Goodnight. Goodnight, John. [door opening] [gasp]. [sigh] You OK? Good morning. Oh. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi, baby. I had a rough night. Oh, you did? I'm sorry. You're probably just getting used to the house. Yeah. That must be it. I've got to go to work. Mother went to the market. She'll be back in less than an hour. So help yourself to breakfast, or anything else you need, all right? Can't you stay with me? Just today? There's nothing I'd rather do, but I can't. I got to go. Bye. Bye. Bye. Sh. Go to sleep. Sh. [gasp] Who are you? Well, hello. Grace. I don't believe you've met Ellsworth, our butler. How do you do? He's mute. Oh. Grace, we don't use this part of the house. It really isn't safe. I think we should go. [phone ringing] Hello. Father James? This is Grace. I had a boy. Congratulations, my dear child. I knew everything would be fine. Just fine. Uh, how do you feel? A little tired, but John has been very good to me. I feel very happy father. Well, you deserve to be happy. I'm absolutely delighted for you. Father? FATHER JAMES (ON PHONE): Yes, my child. GRACE (ON PHONE): I want you to come and bless my baby. Well, yes, of course. Well, I'd only be too honored. Thank you, Father. You are so sweet. I can't believe you are mine. What a beautiful sight. This has made up for everything I never had as a child. I'm glad. Thank you, John. Now Grace, don't. We did this together. Yes, we did, didn't we? Are you all right? Yes. Just a little dizzy. JOHN: Grace. Grace, are you sure? I don't know. JOHN: Here's mother. She'll help you with the baby. Yes. That's right. Come to me, little William. See you soon. All right, let's take it slow. Come on. You're going to be all right. Be careful now. Take it slow. Here's a step. Be careful. Come on, baby. That's it. We go [inaudible]. Come on, Grace. I've got you, love. That's it. Careful. Some more steps. Some more steps. Healthy baby. Thanks. Sweet child. Yes. Yes. [knocking] I'll get it. Linda. I'm sorry I'm late. I got lost. Oh. Thank god you're here. Where's the party? -Come on in. -This is for William. Thank you. Hi, everybody. I'm Linda. Hi, John. Oh, there he is. Hello. Hello. Hello. You are so precious, yes you are. Oh my goodness. There we go. There we go. Oh, he's precious. Oh, look, William. Linda brought you a toy. Oh, Linda. He loves it. Grace, you crack me up. He doesn't even know it exists. GRACE: Well, I love it. [baby crying] LINDA: There we go. Do you want to see the house? Yes. Come on, let's go. Bye. Bye. Did you see the way that old guy was eying my thighs? Yes. Oh. This place is huge. I know. Whoever would have thought two years ago you'd be giving me a tour of the family mansion? Back then I just went from fix to fix. And now you're married to John Churchill. A guy like that. I mean, he owns half of Massachusetts. You helped me a lot back then. We helped each other. This is beautiful. How old is this place? John says it's about 300 years old. Phew. You lucked out. Linda, why do you think John chose me? I don't know. Maybe it's because you're beautiful, intelligent, and you have a great foreign accent. Men love foreign accents. GRACE: They do not. They do, too. I wish I had one. Wow, 300 years old. I bet this place has secret passageways. Does it? It does, doesn't it? Sh. LINDA: Where? Come. I'll show you. Boo. Stop it. Sh. Sh. Ah. Holy moly. You scared the shit out of me. Oh, Ellsworth. Oh, I was just showing the house to Linda. Oh. Oh, I forgot. Uh, this part of the house is, uh, closed. Uh, thank you, Ellsworth. (WHISPERING) Thank you, Ellsworth. We better get down. He's a real charmer. [doorbell ringing] You must be Father James. We've been expecting you. I'm Elizabeth Churchill. Pleased to meet you. Oh, Father James. Oh, Grace. How lovely you look. Thank you. Linda, how are you? I'm pretty good. Not as good as Grace here, but I'm doing all right. Oh, I'm happy to hear that. Come on in, Father. I want to show you my baby. Yes. Yes. Hello, Father. GRACE: Father. Father. Father, are you all right? Huh? Father, are you all right? I, I don't feel very well. Please, excuse me. [screaming] Is everything OK, Father? Yes. Yes, I'll-- I'll be there in a moment. Do you think he's all right? Well, he says so. But if he has a flu, he shouldn't go near the baby. Are you all right, Father? I don't feel well. I must go now, my child. I apologize, Mrs. Churchill. Certainly. Good day, everyone. Take care, Father. Bye, Father. Come, I'll walk you to the door. You must come to see me at the church tomorrow. You must bring the child. I want to baptize him immediately. Is something wrong? I'll see you tomorrow. We'll talk tomorrow. Thank you, Father. God be with you, Grace. I found this in the garden. I thought you might like it. I'll-- I'll leave it here for you. [gasp] [phone ringing] The Lord send him to Satan. The Lord rebuke thee, oh, Satan. [inaudible] the Lord hath chosen [inaudible]. Grace. Grace. Grace. Grace. Grace. You are such a good, little boy. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. There's Mommy. There's Mommy. Hi, Mommy. Hi, Mommy. Hi. These things are so much fun. You feeling OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Come on, let's go lay down, you big boy. You big, old thing. Here we go. OK. Here we go. Oh, there you go. There you go. You are so adorable. Yes, you are. Oh my goodness. What do they put these things on with? Grace. Thank you. I want a baby. How about finding a husband first? Nowadays, husbands are a detail. A minor detail. GRACE: A child needs a father. Well, that depends. [sigh]. This yard is a mess. I didn't even know you had a green thumb. I used to help my father when I was a little girl. LINDA: Grace, you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Just bad memories. They were so happy. I still don't know why my father did it. You don't think insanity runs in the family, do you? I don't know, it runs in mine. Bad joke. Come on, Grace. You are not crazy. He was fine. Until one day he just snapped. Now, what makes you think that that is going to happen to you, huh? Grace. Don't you think it's time little William came inside now? He's fine. It's a little chilly out here, isn't it? He's fine. All right, dear. Whatever you say. Thank you, Ellsworth. Grace, are you all right? Yes. Good. But you haven't touched your dinner, dear. [gasp]. I'm sorry I startled you. You seem a little jumpy. What's the matter? I'm frightened. What are you frightened of? I don't know. Everything's going to be fine. You just had a long day, that's all. You need to get your sleep. Come on. That's it. Here, I brought you some tea. John. Stay with me. I have to get some more work done. I'll be in later. Drink your tea. Goodnight. [thump] John? John? Elizabeth? [sigh] [thumping] [screaming] Grace. Grace, why don't you come inside? The police have left. Grace, please. Come inside. I can't. JOHN: Why not? The garden needs weeding. Grace, you're upset. I know how much the father meant to you. Why did he do it? JOHN: I don't know. How did he get up there? I don't know. I just can't understand. Come inside. Could you stand in one spot? You're wearing me out. I could have helped Father James. You're being too hard on yourself. I could have helped him. You had no way of knowing. What? Wow, this is really neat. I wonder what this is. I wonder who they are. Or were. Grace? Grace, you OK? Yeah. What is this room have to do with Father James' death? So? I saw Father James hanged in this mirror. What do you mean? I saw him hanged before he was dead. How? I don't know. Grace, it's just a mirror. I saw it. I've seen other things, too. Grace, you're worrying me. Something is wrong here. I'm scared. Grace, there's nothing there. You talk to John about this? No. You think it's all in my mind, don't you? [sigh]. I think you're under a lot of stress. I know what I saw. Here, I want you to keep this with you. What is it? It's the cross Father James gave me. Please, Grace. You're scaring me. Oh, there you are, love. Hello, Linda. Mother needs your help with William. He's a lot to handle. OK. I'll talk to you later. Excuse us. John. May I talk with you for a moment? Sure, Linda. What's on your mind? I'm worried about Grace. Yes, we all are. Father's death was a great shock to her. I know. Is she taking any medication? Has the doctor prescribed any? No. I think it's just going to take her a little time to get over it, that's all. I'm sure she'll be fine. Thanks for your concern. I should get back now. [sigh]. Hi. Hi. I need you. I'm here. Hold me. You seem so distant lately. No, I'm here. Make love to me. It's too soon. I don't care. Honey, this really isn't the place. Grace, stop it. What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. This just isn't the place. Ever since we got here, you've been avoiding me. That's not true. It is true. You spend more time with your mother than you do with me. You're imagining things. I am not imagining things. Lower your voice. I will not lower my voice. Why are you so upset? Just forget it. Grace. What's wrong? I don't know. Do you want to talk about it? No. Grace, I know what you've been going through. But this has got to stop. I love you. It's pretty hard to tell sometimes. [sigh]. I know I should be spending more time with you. I apologize. I'm sorry for the way I've been behaving. I don't know what's wrong with me. It's all right. Let's go home. Did you hear me? I want to go home. When you're up to it. I'm fine. I just need to go home. What's wrong? We can't. Why not? We lost the house. What? There was a fire. We lost everything. When? A week ago. A week ago? JOHN: I didn't know how to tell you. I'm sorry. I didn't know how to tell you. After all you've been through, I knew it would upset you. Please don't touch me. ELIZABETH: Grace. Grace. Where are you going? I'm going to see my house. I don't think that's a very good idea, dear. You'll just upset yourself. I want to see it. Well, why are you taking William with you ? I want him with me. Oh, that's a very long drive for such a small baby. I think you better leave him here. OK. Don't worry. I'll take care of him. WOMAN: Hi. Hello. Terrible fire last night. What? Terrible fire last night. That can't be. It burned down last week. Maybe I'm crazy, but I saw that fire last night from the window across the street. John. John. John? John? John? [laughter] No. Go to hell. No. ELIZABETH: Grace. Grace, where are you? Grace. JOHN: Grace. Grace. ELIZABETH: Grace. Stay away from me. ELIZABETH: Grace, I've made you some tea. I don't want any tea. Where's William? He's in the nursery. Where's William? He's in the nursery. I don't believe you. I want to see him. It's OK, sweetie. He's sleeping in the nursery. I've seen him. Linda. Grace, please have your tea. I don't want any tea. Stay away from me. We'll wait outside. You want to tell me what happened, sweetie? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't remember. You don't remember anything? I didn't do it, Linda. I'm scared. John and Elizabeth-- It's OK. Hey, I'm going to stay right here with you tonight, OK? So you won't have anything to worry about. You just get some rest. Thanks, Linda. You bet. LINDA: Grace. Grace. Grace. Linda? Linda? LINDA: Grace. Linda. Linda? Linda? [screaming] Grace. Grace. Grace. It's OK. It's OK. Sh. Sh. It's all right. Easy. Easy. It was just a bad dream. Oh, Linda. It's OK. I'm right here. Oh. It's OK. It was horrible. In that room. I want to get out of here. -It's all right. Everything's OK. It was just a bad dream. All right? Oh, Linda. Where did you get this? This looks like the cross you gave me. It is the cross I gave you. Father James' cross. Where did you get this? I left this at home on my nightstand. Grace? Can you show me where you found this? Linda? Linda? Linda? Grace. Grace. Grace? "John and Elizabeth Stocton were accused of practicing witchcraft in 1687. They were burned together at the stake. The townspeople conducted the burning in the backyard of the Stocton family home. It is believed that Elizabeth Stocton was pregnant at the time of the burning." You scared me. [screaming] [screaming]. Hello, Grace. We've been expecting you. It's all over. John. We have to thank you, Grace. Isn't that right, Elizabeth? Yes. You have brought back our child. You're sick. He's my child. He's our child. We are John and Elizabeth Stocton. And we have returned. You, Grace, you were just a vessel for the return of our child. Satan is most powerful when he inhabits such an angel of light. [laughter] No, John. Oh, John, no. No, John. No. No. No. No. No. No! [screaming]. No. No. No. No. No. I love you. I love you. I love you. [baby crying] William. [music playing]
