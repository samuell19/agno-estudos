- Where's my brother? - Lt. Brewster'll be right back, sir. l'll wait. Hiya, sweetheart. You Jezebel, you. What are you doing here? The magnificent obsession. l've been wanting to see you. - Have a cigar. - Thanks. That's one of mine! - You don't think l'd give you a good one? - On your way. - Can you keep a secret? - Yeah, what is it? - l need fifty bucks. - Okay, l won't tell a soul. But this is my shore leave. l want to paint San Francisco red. - Why bother me? - l need a brush. All right. Here's five. Five? Well, l'll find a smaller town. Walter... About Nancy. ls it going to be orange blossoms this trip? l hope so. Why? Because Nancy's dynamite, and she's got to be handled. The way you are, you couldn't handle a firecracker. Now, me, that's different. l'm dynamite too. You haven't seen as many ports as l have. If ever l married Nancy, she'd be right there. - Where? - Well, there. Someplace... - Will you please... - Take that face. - Oh, boy. - She's taken you. - She's beautiful. - Yeah. But tricky. And those eyes. Stop and go signals if ever l saw any. And don't kid yourself, that's no dimple. That's from leaning against those Navy buttons. - All right, come on. - l'm not talking for myself! - But why don't you switch to Letty? - Letty?! She's always been crazy about you. And can she cook! That'd make two women happy. Letty'd get you, and Nancy'd get me. You know, kind of romantic. Brewster brothers, Larkin sisters? That doesn't hurt. That does! Honest, every time l think of Nancy, l get a pain right here. - Yeah? - Well, things are changing all over. But wait a minute! You can't kick me. - I can't? - No. Captain's compliments, sir. Captain's compliments, sir! He'd like to see Lt. Brewster. - l'll be right along. - He'll be right along. Just one more thing. Get this through your thick head. l'm going ashore, and l'm gonna propose to Nancy. lf she accepts me, we'll be married before the fleet sails, so none of your tricks! No more monkey business from you and Letty. - What are you talking about? - You know what l'm talking about. Ever since l bought Nancy her first lollipop, you and Letty have been snooping... and plotting and writing each other notes. - Tyin' to gum us up! - That's ridiculous! l don't know how you do it, but l have a feeling l'm being double-crossed. Why, Walter! That hurts! - You think l'd do a thing like that to you? - You're darn right l do. Not me! Not to my own blood brother. For ten years l've been promising myself a crack at your California trout. lf it wasn't your home territoy, l wouldn't impose on you. - Do you mind? - No imposition at all, sir. l'll drive up to Lake Paradise and make any arrangements you wish. - l don't know much about the accommodations - Never mind the accommodations. - How's the fishing? - It used to be terrific, sir. Fine. For a mess of rainbow trout, l'd sleep in a rain barrel! - You sure it's no trouble, chief? - No trouble. l'll telephone the message the minute l get ashore. Miss Letty Larkin. Don't forget. The phone number's on it. Nancy's out. Yeah, out. No. No. No. All right. All right, all right. Ice! The icebox's plumb full. l couldn't get this in nowhere. Nancy is having a picnic. - Do you know anything about cameras? - No, do you? Here. - You can't leave this here! - l did! You big old...! Somebody! l'm freezing! She's out! Yeah, Nancy's out! No. No! No! All right, all right. Come on, Ethel May. Letty's so busy. Do you mind if l leave Ethel May with you? The little Angel has been pestering me all morning. Haven't either, see? Look it! Naughty, naughty. To Walter from Letty! Mrs. Brewster, l wonder if you'd take my picture. Good gracious, dear! lf l stop, l'll never get back in time for the picnic! Too much filling, dear. Good-bye. - A toboggan! - Ethel May! Now, stop! Give me my ice! Letty loves Uncle Walter! There's the front door! - And there's the back door! - My mother said l could stay! l don't care what your mother said! Hello? No. It's the front door! It's you. - And l had my key all the time! Isn't that funny! Yeah, l'm dying Iaughing. Good-bye! - Letty! It's hot in here. - Yeah, l know. - Let me help you. - There's a catch in there someplace. No! l was just wondering if you'd Iend me your flowered dress. My dress? - Yes. You see, it's just my shade of blue, and... Well, l thought it'd be so nice for the picnic. Sure. That's why l'm wearing it. But it's too small for you! You simply bulge in it. Well, you're not gonna bulge in it. Please, Letty, look. You can have my New Jersey knit. And look like a bag full of eggs? Darn you, Nancy. You've been tying to get that dress ever since l made it. What's this? - It's a cake. - Yeah. To Walter from Letty. Well, isn't that just too sweet. l would have put Jim's name on it too, but l ran out of icing. Of course. - Sure. Walter doesn't mean anything in my life. lt's just that Walter's name happened to come first. Ha-ha, said the duchess, Iaughing. Letty loves Uncle Walter! Scat! Go out and dig yourself a nice big hole. And fall in it! Letty, dear, call the drugstore. l'm all out of... Now, see here, my love. All l've got to get through before 5:00 is... a couple of hundred sandwiches, four dozen stuffed eggs and a nervous breakdown! And if you think - That reminds me! You better plan on three more. l ran into Bill Slawson and the Myers twins, and they heard about your picnic, and... My picnic? l wonder how many l'd have to make if you called it your picnic! That's for you. The phone's been hot all morning. Miss Larkin? l got a message for you. Little Boy Blue has blown his horn. l can't hear. Speak louder. Has blown his horn. - Horn! Like on a cow. - Mooo! And will ask Miss Muffet to... to sit on his tuffet. Get outta here! Must be for you. - Hello. - Good-bye. Hello? Yeah. We've got to boil the cabbage fast. Signed... Prince Charming. Prince charming. Isn't that sweet? Meyl! Leave my sandwiches alone. Okay. - Shame on you. - Well, l gotta eat. - Why aren't you down at the store? - Been fired. That's swell. Four jobs in three months! Five, counting that time l run over that speed cop. How's about loaning your cousin a couple of smackeroos? Beat it, Meyl. You got five the last time. Hello, Ethel May! You think you could take a picture of me? Sure. For a couple of bucks. - All right. But could you? - Sure. It's a cinch. - ls there enough light in here? - Sure. Walter says it's a special lens. Put it down here. How do you work this gadget? You focus through here, and then you push this little button. Just get it from the waist up, and be sure and get the cake in. No, no. Further back. Wait a minute. l'm gonna count. One. Two. Three. - l got it. - Look, look! The thing- - Don't wory. l'll get it. - Look out now! Scat! The camera! Take him out of here! Look what you've done now! - Anyway, we got the picture. - l hope so. But what we got ain't nothing to what we're gonna get when Walter sees his camera. Hey, Letty. What was that crash? Meyl just took my picture for the cooking contest. l'm entering the recipe for my yum yum special. l guess the film's all right. Take it down to the drugstore and wait. Then send it off 'cause it's the last day. Wait a minute. Here's the whole works, address and everything. Here. Now go on. Now, hury. Hury, Meyl! You goin' fishin' again, Dad? - Yeah. Got a new rod. - What are you Iookin' for? - l lost my worms. - l left them on the hall table in a tin. - Fresh? - l dug them this morning. The last ones had no wiggle. l like them fresh. - l forgot something else too. - Lunch. How about a nice long, cool beer with it? You go put your feet up, and l'll get a tray. You're a solace to my graying hairs. Both of them. Little Boy Blue means Walter. - She said to hury. l gotta mail it. - Yours is comin' up. Just about now. l'll just put this one in. Yeah, l'm right. Here it comes. Well! It looks like a good one. l thought you said this was a picture of Letty! She's hopin' to win a prize. lt's really a picture of her yum yums. l'll say it is. Oh, my! Dear mask, please make me beautiful for Walter's sake. Amen. - Hi, luscious! - Hello, Jim. - Your number-one man has returned. - Really? Bring him in! All right. Wait a minute. l'm in! How about a welcome? Boy, right on the nose. Do l need practice! - Now, look. - l'm sory. - Go away! Where's Walter? That's gratitude? Me at sea for months. Not sleeping, thinking of you, breaking my neck to get here. For what? Where's Walter?, that's for what. Come here. Now, listen. l've gotta talk fast because what l have to say is important to both of us. Walter's coming here, and he's going to ask you to mary him. - And you're gonna tell him no. - l'll tell him no such thing. Yes, you will! Three months with Walter, and you'd blow up. - l won't listen to another word. - Don't get me wrong. Walter's a great guy, has ambition. Be an admiral someday. But if you mary him, instead of a kiss, - he'll want a salute. - Fine brotherly talk, l must say. - Disloyal? - Yes, very. l guess you're right. After all, he is my brother. l shouldn't say anything about his bad temper. l ought to even keep quiet about the time he tried to use an ice pick on me. lce pick? Why? - l knocked his teeth out of a glass of water. Are you quite finished? - You see what l mean? - Wait a minute! Think Letty'd like to have Walter take her to the picnic? Now you're talkin'! If Walter took Letty, then you and l could... What do you mean, Walter take Letty? You crazy or something? - He will if l ask him. - Yeah, if. - Well, l'm going to. - Will you, Nancy? Say, that'll be wonderful! Then you... Don't forget what l told you. Give him plenty of ice. - Hi! - What do you mean by taking all the gas... She's waiting. - Well, here l am. - Oh, Walter! 'Ello? 'Ello? 'ls is 'etty 'Arkin. 'Etty 'Arkin. Lady, let's start over. And this time, slowly. An' l 'ant 'et it off. Lady, you're drunk. - You'd better go and sleep it off. - Aw, 'uts! Ethel 'ay! It's 'etty! - It's onlv 'e! It's 'e! - Letty. l was- Go 'ay! Go 'ay! Hey, Letty! There are no such things as ghosts. Come here! Letty! Let me in. l want to tell you something. Snap into it. Walter's gonna take you to the picnic. You picked a fine time to celebrate Halloween! Get that mud pie off your face. - l 'ant 'et it off. - What? That's cooperation for you. For ten years l've been working my brain to the bone, scheming how to fix you up with Walter, and what have you done? Your big moment, and here you are, looking like a bad job of embalming. How did you ever get into that facial strait jacket anyway? What? And there you are? You got a hammer? A chisel? l got an idea. Don't wory. Nothing serious. Nothing drastic. You won't feel a thing. You'll never know what hit you. Just stand still. One, two, three! That didn't hurt, did it? You feel all right? Let me help you. Now you're all right. There. Wait. Here, hold that. - l'll just give it a little tap, right there. - No! The next time you use one of those, put a zipper on it. Now hury up and get dressed. And in the name ofa beautiful romance, try and look like something! l'll be outside, waiting. Don't be a stuffed shirt. l made the date before l had any idea you'd be home. - What's his name? - Rodney Weatherwax. - Navy? - No. Fertilizer. And very important socially. Mr. Weatherwax, l mean. l still don't like it. Let's not quarrel, darling. Look at me. That's better. Now smile. Let's be grown ups. Just because l have social obligations, it doesn't mean that l don't love you. Look, sweet. l'll tell you what we'll do. You take Letty. - Letty? - Now, wait. And the minute you get there, you can ditch her, and l'll ditch Rodney. And it'll be just as if we'd gone together. Letty! - Hiya, cookie! - Hello, Walter. l'm taking you to the picnic. Me? You're taking me? l mean, are you? Better get dressed, and l'll be back later. All right. l'm not nervous. Hey, Jim. Fix my lashes for me, will you? l got the shakes. Did he ask you? That gets it. No, l'll get some water. It's all right. Just sit right down here. l'll hang it three layers thick. Plenty of charm. - Don't get it in my eye. Haven't missed an eye for years. Boy, that's marvelous. With those lashes, you could clean the windows. lf you get a chance, just wiggle at him, like this. Give him the roll. - l'll fan him with them. - That's got it! Thanks, Jim. Give me a dime, and l'll tell you something. l got troubles, l don't have to buy them. But it's about Uncle Walter. About Walter? Okay. Nancy said to Uncle Walter, You take Letty to the picnic, and ditch her, and l'll ditch Rodney. And then... - Go away. - Just as if they went together. What's the matter? - Will you please go away? - Well, all right. But you still owe me my dime. Nancy snitched your blue dress, and she's gonna wear it too. - Hello, Rodney. - Hello, Nancy! - You look grand. - Do you like it? Letty! Come on. Walter's yelling for you. He's downstairs. l'm not going. That's fine, only hury. What?! l'm not going. Great Caesar's ghost! Why? - Because. - Because. She's not going. Ten years of scheming kicked in the pants. Our a greement, a mere nothing. Won't you please open the door? Come on. Remember your oath, darling? Letty? Letty? Letty! Let me in, or l'll drag you through the keyhole! - Open the door! - No. Aw, you... Walter. Why aren't you dancing? What's the matter? Got on a stiff shirt? Walter's all right. He's just got funny ideas. Old-fashioned ones. What goes on here In my heart All this bumpin' and thumpin' and jumpin' When l see you What goes on here When we part It keeps bumpin' and thumpin' and jumpin' The whole night through It will stop a while So quiet, and then If you happen to smile There's a riot again What goes on here In my heart, dear Could this bumpin' and thumpin' and jumpin' Be love What goes on here - In my heart - l wish l knew. All this bumpin' and thumpin' and jumpin' - When l see you - How many fellows doyou say that to? What goes on here When we part It keeps bumpin' and thumpin' and jumpin' - The whole night through - Maybe it's indigestion. It will stop a while So quiet, and then If you happen to smile There's a riot again What goes on here In my heart, dear Could this bumpin' and thumpin' and jumpin' Be love Honey, let's go someplace. l want to talk to you. - ln a minute. - What do you mean? - Now, really, l must say... - Mustn't scowl. Come on, honey, let's have fun. lt's fun having fun. And if l don't hit the deck every time you whistle, it doesn't mean that l don't love you, does it? Come on. If you want to have fun, Iet's have fun! All right. l'll get them! Quiet, everybody! Quiet! We're going to eat now! There's enough for everybody. Who'll get Letty's good food out of my car? - There's something l want to say. - Yes, dear? With the pay l'm getting now, don't you think... It's gone! It's gone! There isn't any! It isn't anyplace! It isn't in the car! What's gone? - The food! Our supper! This is all there was. Jim. You shouldn't have stolen all the food. Why not? We were gypped. - Puppets of passion, that's what we are. - This thing called love. It don't make sense, Jim. Me, for instance. Ever since l first saw Walter, all l've had is a pain. Here. l know. Sort of like a blown-up feeling. Pickle? No, sir, Letty. It just don't make sense. Just don't add up. l'm tired of counting on that handsome lug. - But you're not going to quit now. - l have quit. But you can't after ten years. We've just begun to fight. You fight. a girl's gotta have her pride. Walter just can't see me through Nancy's dust. - Quiet. Let me think. You know something? About food, l mean. You feed a fellow right, and it sort of makes him home-conscious. Gets him to thinkin' about a little woman all his own, - flitting about in a cute little kitchen. - What's cute about a kitchen? - l've got it. - Well, take it easy. Suppose there was a flood. And you and Walter were marooned, the two of you, alone. - And you cooked for him. - Cook for Walter? And you kept on cooking and loading him up with chow like this. - You know what'd happen? - He'd run for the bicarbonate. No, no. The minute the flood went down, he'd be saying l do. - That flood's an idea. - Sure it is! - And alone with Walter? - That's right. That's terrific! l could... Yeah, but... - But what? - Who's gonna dynamite the dam? Give me my pickle back. l don't see why you have to go now. The sooner l go, the sooner l'll get back. l think Captain Tallant's an old meany. Couldn't you phone Paradise Valley? You could arrange his silly old fishing trip that way. There aren't any phones. That's why they call it Paradise Valley. - Can't l go with you? - Absolutely not. The county's primitive. l don't want to take Aunt Minnie's car. l'll borrow Jim's roadster. l ought to be back tomorrow night. Well, all right, then. Come in. Hey, Dad! l... There you are! If l went off someplace, l mean with a man... A nice man! And there were just the two of us, and l cooked for him, and l kept on feeding him and feeding him, do you think he'd sort of like me? After he had enough to eat? Sure. That's the way your mother won me. - But how did you win her? - Well, l'll tell you. The first time l kissed her, she said, That's it. - Then what did she do? - She fainted. Gee, Pop. l bet you were dynamite! What did she feed you to make you kiss like that? Flapjacks. - That's all l wanted to know. Good night, cutie. Darn it. He loves me, he loves me not. He loves me... Hello, Jim? This is Nancy. Walter has a terrible chill. He has? That's fine, l'll be right over! No, don't be silly. l was just wondering if you'd drive up to Paradise Valley in his place? Paradise Valley. That's 90 miles! Not me. You would if l asked you, wouldn't you? l promise you l'll appreciate it. l can't, Nancy. Ninety miles is quite... No! l... l'll be right over. lt's all settled. Jim's going. He's coming right over. - Did he squawk? - He did not. Hello! Hello, ducks. What is this? Hello? Pardon me, madam. Walter. Sugar? Do you like sugar on your grapefruit? Do you like music with your meals, dear? Walter? Would you like bacon with your pancakes, or... sausages? You! And singing! Great Caesar's ghost! What have you got to sing about? Well, l... - Quiet! How did you get here? ln the back. How did you get here? - ln the front. - Where's Walter? l'll tell you where Walter is. He's home with Nancy, and she's probably wrapped around his neck. l'd never have come if l hadn't figured on you being there to keep an eye on them. lt was all your idea about me getting Walter off alone. Was that rain? No, it wasn't rain, and don't change the subject. - It was too. Residents and tourists in the High Sierras. A storm with freak cloudbursts is flooding roads and streams in that area. Motorists should avoid back roads near the temporay dam at Paradise Lake. We better get out of here. We're just below the dam. You back the car up closer. l'll get these things together. Get out! Letty, help me! Stop hollering at me, Jim! - Come on, Letty! Kids. - Gee! Something's burning! l know. That's me. Don't tell me. - Hey, Jim! - What? It's raining. - Maybe it will put the fire out. - Yeah. - Oh, Jim. - Now what? Cary me over. Will you, please? Cary you over! Look you... You golliwog! l'm tired. l'm hungy. l'm lost. l got pneumonia. My feet hurt. l'll probably die. And it's all your fault! You balled up everything. You burnt my car. Now you want me to cary you?! You walk the same as l do, and l hope you drown! That's all! l tell you... - What's new? What do you want? - You got a cigarette? - No, but l got a cold l'd gladly give ya. - Thanks, l have one of my own. Move over, will ya? A little heat. Now, look. When Walter comes... - When who comes? - Walter, my brother. l wired him. - l won't let Walter see me like this! - He's not going to. l'll make a touch, give you some money, you can slip out the back way. - But, why? - Why? Because Walter's got old-fashioned ideas. lf he ever finds us here like this, we're cooked. - Don't be silly. - Quit arguing and go on home! But how am l gonna get home? Take a bus, borrow roller skates, hire a bicycle or just skid along on... Well, just skid along! You're not gonna push me out in the night. If l'm gonna drown, a little scandal, more or less, won't hurt. All right. Stay then, only don't... Scandal! You got it. It's in the bag. And l'll be holding it. What? When Walter comes, l'll have them send him to your room. But Walter wasn't supposed to see me. That was now. l mean, this is then. The minute he gets into your room, you do this: you look at him and talk to him. You walk over to the door like this. When you get over here, you back up and lock the door. And you take out the key. You see? Then, keep the key well concealed, and you move nonchalantly to the window, looking at Walter. But, what am l saying? What does a lady say when a gentleman busts into her room? l don't know. No gentleman ever tried. You lean out, and you do like l'm doing. And you say, Ah, it's raining. l wouldn't lean out if it was raining. l mean, it is raining, of course, but l... - Do you want to mary Walter? - Yes, of course, but l... All right. Now, you lean out, and you say... What l told you to say before. You drop the key. l'm waiting down below. l pick it up and bust in at the crucial moment. When's that? When you cy out, My own beloved, nothing can ever part us now. Oh, no! - You throw yourself into Walter's arms. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let's rehearse it. - Come on! Get the door. - All right! Let's get into it. l locked the door. - Now l'll be Walter. - Hello, Walter. My, Walter, how you have changed. Yes, l have. Do you want to do this, or not? All right! We are having weather, I mean, aren't we? - ls that what l said? - It's raining. Come on, come on! It might work. The rain. Little tears ofcystal, dropping, dropping... dropping. Stick to the act, will ya? We're not... You couldn't have dropped it. - l got carried away. - l'll just take you... You can... Jim, it's Walter. Open the door. No! Don't! l'll be there in a minute, Walter. l'm just slipping into something. Hide! Go. Take it there. Hide! Hey, wait. Wait! There. That way. Just a minute, Walter. l can't get under there. It's too low! - Open the door. - l can't, it's too low. l mean... l can't! What do you mean, you can't? Open the door. l sort a Iost the key. Wait a minute! How do you like that? Maid, have you a pass key? Would you mind, please? It's my brother. Walter, if you'll send up the proprietor, l'll join you in a couple of minutes. - Thanks! - Hello, everybody. What's the idea of locking the door and losing the key? l dropped it out the window. You mean, you deliberately dropped it? Don't be silly. l didn't drop- Yes, yes. l t's a sort of a game. - A game? - Yeah, a game! Drop the key, they call it. - You were playing it all alone? - To pass away the time. And to play it, you drop the key. - l guess. - What? l know it sounds like l'm kidding, but l dropped it. l have a cold. That was me. Hello. - Letty! - Why you cute things, you! Of course! Dad said he had an idea you two would elope, but we just laughed at him. Bet you Iaughed your heads off. But, we're not married? - Not married? - No. Jim, l'm ashamed of you! - Walter, wait a minute! - Letty Larkin, of all people? - Listen, Aunt Minnie...! - Wait! Yo?'ve got us all wrong. l can explain everything. Honest, l can. You can? Fine. Then maybe you can tell us why Letty was hiding. Well, Letty... We... l was... The thing... And we... we... Navy to take another bride. The happy couple. Gee, ain't that romantic? Letty? Romantic? That's a funny one. Walter? Isn't it just too marvelous? Jim and dear Letty are going to be married on a battleship. l know. Walter arranged it. - Did you see this? - l was just thinking. Maybe if l spoke to that nice Captain Tallant, he might fire off a big gun. No, on second thought, l guess we better keep guns out of it. People might get wrong ideas. For a nicely-rounded-out, hand-tooled, sandblasted job of gumming things up, dropping that key will stand on its own merits. Here. There must be some way out. You could leave me waiting at the church, then everybody'd feel sory for me. Then Nancy'd think l was a cad. l'd rather mary you. If you had any chivaly, you'd commit suicide. That's an idea. And l could knock you off first. lt would be a service to humanity. They'd name a destroyer after me. You got something. l think that's... My berries! Oh, you...! We are facing a fate worse than death, and you squawking about berries. What do you want berries for? Listen, Sea Biscuit, those berries were for our nuptial feast. - Hey, Letty! She's out there. - Thanks. - Now what? - l don't know. - Telegram for Miss Letty Larkin. - That's me. Probably another message of condolence. A jolly little wedding we're gonna have. It's it! l mean, l won! It's my yum yums. Fine time for baby talk. Requested you be at room 310, Fidelity Building, San Francisco. Today, 3:00 P. M., for final decision in contest. Prizes amounting to thousands. - Thousands. - There must be a mistake. The first prize was a fireless cooker. - Let's get going. - But l can't go now. You read the wire. Let's nail this money. Walter invited Captain Tallant to dinner, and Nancy can't cook. - lf l run out now... - Don't be silly! - You want to mary me? - l'd rather die! - Come on then! - What's this got to do with... Just win, make headlines, get this money, and you won't have to mary me. But what about my reputation? The way you'll be sitting, you won't need a reputation. - Nancy, look, it's getting... - l know dinner's an hour late. l know your Captain Tallant is hungy, but how do you cook these filthy things? - And, why? - Listen, darling... Why does a grown man make such a fuss about wanting to eat silly looking fish? Captain Tallant walked 85 miles, slept out two nights and broke a $65 rod to catch these. Roughly speaking, they cost him about eight bucks a piece. Naturally, he wants to eat them. Mr. Larkin. There's only one way to cook a nice, fresh mountain trout. Sure. You whip 'em out, gut 'em, roll 'em in cornmeal... Sacrilege, definitely! First, you take your trout, you clean them, then you rub them thoroughly with good olive oil. - Then your cornmeal. - You see? Afterwards. Wait, dear. l'm hungy. How did you cook these? With a blow torch? Animal? Vegetable? Or mineral? Sory. Well... Maybe they're just a little bit too... Yes. - How are the dogs? - They're okay? - How fast are we going? - Sixty. - Will you drive into a tree? - Yeah. What?! - What for? - l just want to see if l'm dreaming. You're awake. Keep your furs on, and we'll be home in a minute. You gotta do your stuff with Walter. We've never had a chance like this before. That's what scares me. l promised Walter l'd cook Captain Tallant's fish. - lnstead, l'm coming home with... - With the bacon. You don't have to apologize to Walter for anything. - But how am l gonna act? - Just keep him guessing. Don't tell him a thing. Put him on ice. You look like a duchess. - Do l? - Yes, so don't be a dope. Act like one. lf you can't cook, which you obviously can't, why didn't you get a woman in? Why should l? Letty knew it was tonight.

Walter hasn't proposed yet. l got a feeling he's sorta working himself up to it. Yeah. He's a sucker for this glamour stuff. What do you care? You got Nancy. l've been making a little progress. But l'm afraid if Walter ever waggled a brass button at her, she'd be back around his neck like a tight collar. Okay, sailor. l'll stick it out for you. Gee, you're a great kid, Letty. Ever notice Nancy's hair in the sun? All shiny like a halo. Yeah, and Walter's eyes? All sort of blue. Nice. And her divine little snooty nose. l'd follow him to the ends of the earth, even on these feet. Little Nancy. l'll get it. - There you are. - Thank you, Jim. Hello. - It's Walter. - Really?

Ethel May, take the lid off the bridal bouquet and give it some air. - And how does the bride feel? - Like l've been shot out of a gun. No way for a bride to feel.

You look nervous. No, sir. l want to thank you, sir. l mean, l appreciate... You're excusing me from duty. For heaven's sake! Take a reef in your sails. You look like someone opened your bilge cocks. You're not being court-martialed. You're being married. - l know, sir. - Look, man. l'm a bachelor, and l'm not supposed to know anything about these things, but if l were in your spot, which l'm not... l'd take aboard about four straight brandies... with a good strong stinger for a chaser. lf that didn't work, l'd take an anesthetic. - Meet you aboard. - Very good, sir. With a firing party. Here it is, over here. Come on, darling. Letty! Hello, Walter. You look beautiful! Thank you. l mean, thanks a lot. l didn't know. l mean, you are beautiful! Definitely!

And my feet don't hurt. - What? - Well! My goodness, me. Couldn't you two wait a couple of hours? Just dropped in to wish you the best and all that. Thanks, Nancy. While l'm at it, l'd like to have your joint blessings, very extra special ones. Jim and l are being married. - What? - That's fine, Nancy. That's... What? Just a plain, simple, little hit-and-run wedding. No battleships, of course. Well, l'll be seeing you. Jim! Listen, Nancy. You can't just plop into marriage like that. - Why not? The fleet sails tonight. - l know, but you can't mary Jim. Why? - Because Jim's dynamite, and he's got to be handled. You couldn't even handle a firecracker! l could too! - One month of Jim, and you'd blow up in his face! What do you care who l mary? You've got Letty, haven't you? Yes, but, l'm thinking of you.

You can't mary Nancy. You mustn't! lt'd be the same way with you as it was with me. l mean, when you kiss her. Well, it's just like... l can't explain it, but... Kiss me. You'll find out. All right. How was that? - Well... - Again. Now here. And here. And here. And here. - Say! - You see what l mean? Yeah! But do you suppose you and l could be in love? l mean, us? Why didn't you tell me that before?
