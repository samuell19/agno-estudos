"Marukita Co. Ltd." How's it going? Keep it down. Oh, sorry. Be quiet. - Hear anything? - Nope. Feeling better now? Yes, a lot better. What about the other guy? I heard it'll take him about 2 or 3 months to recover. You could be charged with assault, then. The cops questioned me at the hospital, but the guy doesn't intend to sue so we'll settle out of court. Let it go. What's done is done. Don't be ridiculous! We won't be allowed to just let it go in this day and age! Oh... Sorry. Miyamoto, what will you do from now on? You won't be single anymore. Uh, well... Maybe you're feeling bigheaded now, but fighting won't provide for your family. With your teeth like that... you can't do your job. What will you work for from now on? Why come at all? Um... I... I intend to make money for my family. Then get down to business! Yes. Mr. Oda. I'm sorry you always have to deal with me. It's my job. This isn't my problem. I won't ask why you got into this fight, but it was so important you let work slide. I can't say this openly, but go ahead and do what you want. People are selfish just being alive. Go ahead and deem everyone your enemy. Feel free to antagonize thousands of people. You're that kind of guy, right? That's right. I can antagonize anyone, anytime. And that includes your family. Uh, well... Make sure your wife knows she's in for a lot of hardship. "Takeo Miyamoto" Here you go. Thank you. Nice to meet you. I'm Yasuko Nakano. I'm Hiroshi's mother. What's so funny? Well... Obviously I'm his father. Make yourself at home, Yasuko. Thank you. Don't be shy. Let's keep it casual. Hanako, hush. Oh, her name is Hanako? Oh yeah, why don't I bring out the cakes that Yasuko brought? Hey, where's the lighter? It's in the drawer below the bookshelf. Hello there, Hanako. We're getting married. What a way to tell us. Do it over, Hiroshi. I knew an older woman would be good for him. He's such a big baby. He is kind of like that. What do you mean? And he's stubborn. Hope he's not troubling you. Of course not. But do go on, Mrs. Miyamoto! That's enough, you two. It's your fault. When he was in kindergarten... Oh, don't you like sushi? No, I love it. Thank you. I'm still hungry. Let me have some. It's OK. So what happened in kindergarten? I tricked him into going to the ENT doctor. He grabbed a utility pole near the clinic and wouldn't move. Shouting, "You cheated, Mom!" Mom, you have rice here. That's so like you. Do you feel sick? No, I'd just like to use your bathroom. Yasuko? I'm fine. Should we tell the sushi place? Yes. Are you OK? Don't get up. - Here's some barley tea. - Thank you. I suppose you shouldn't take any pills. You're pregnant, aren't you? You know what? I think Yasuko is a nice girl. Yasuko is a nice girl. Yeah. Really nice. Hiroshi. What I'm about to say is important. What? Say it. Come on, sit if you're talking. Hiroshi. I dislike the way you're handling things. You never tell us anything. When you were hospitalized last week... You injured a man and the police came but you told us nothing. But that's over and done with. Of course it's not. Tell me why you won't let me visit the hospital and apologize. And now... you suddenly bring a woman over and say you're marrying. I told you over the phone. You said nothing about getting married! And also... about her being pregnant. Tell me why you were hiding that. Pregnant? She told me. How much did she tell you? What do you mean, how much? Oh, never mind. What? Say it. It's nothing. But... I said, never mind! What do you mean? Never mind! Geez. Stop being so sneaky. Hiroshi, can you become a father like this? None of your business! You should have told me so before. Miyamoto. What, so you were awake? What were you talking about? Hmm? Just, you know... getting permission from your folks, engagement, betrothal gifts, and wedding plans... Wouldn't leave me alone. What about the baby? She found out, huh? Should we... keep "that" a secret? It's OK, don't worry. But Miyamoto... Just don't worry about it. Your mom... congratulated me. Oh! Unfamiliar with this area? Yeah. Want to come over to my place? That supermarket had a sale and I bought a bunch. No? - Uh, I don't mind. - Good. Then let's go. - I'll take those. - It's OK. It's OK. - I'll take them. - I'm fine. I'm used to it. You were singing that before, too. Really? So do you do any cooking, Miyamoto? No, not at all. Oh, I see. But let me give you a hand. No, just stay seated. - I'll take those, then. - Thanks. - Here you go. Thanks for waiting. - Wow! Thank you. I'll put them in the middle. Shall I pour some? No, it's OK. Eat before it cools. Then I'll open these. Thanks. Let's eat, then. Tastes good! Feminine wiles, you see. Care is the spice, love is the flavor. It's good. Okinawan stir-fry, right? Hey! Yasuko! It's me! That idiot. What should I do? It's OK. I changed the lock. He can't get in. What's wrong with you? Hey! Hurry up and open this door! Ms. Nakano, I... It's me, Yuji! Who are you? You don't belong here now. Go away. Who is that? Just get out of here! I won't let you inside anymore! Come on, let me in. Ow! It's hot! Damn it, what do you want? Get lost. Get lost. Where's the beer? Found it. What are you doing? Miyamoto! Yes? You irritate me, too. Let's make a toast, Yasuko. A toast with beer! But you're in love with that man, aren't you? I can't stand it. That's why you're such a kid. Don't take it out on me. You're making me do it! Then I'll leave. Hey, you two seem to be on good terms. What's this about, Miyamoto? Stop it! I'm begging you. Please just let me go now. Yasuko. Don't try to comfort me. Yasuko, don't cry. You have a stock of other women. How many years do I have to bear this? Yasuko, let's get married. That's not what I mean! Stop considering me a safe bet! While you're sleeping with other women, I have to shut up and wait patiently for you? I've slept with him. Over and over again! I just did what you do, so you don't mind, right? Right? You can't complain! She's so confident I won't hit her, huh? Shut up. This... This woman is special. I'll protect this woman. I'll protect her. I'll protect Yasuko Nakano. I'll protect her. The fish will die from the chlorine, lady-killer. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You can go now. I've treated you terribly. I just used you to break up with Yuji. You're such a convenient guy. "I'll protect this woman." "I'll protect Yasuko Nakano." That's so funny. Then keep laughing. Can I believe you? Miyamoto. I'm sure you tried to act strong, but a woman wants to believe lines like that for once. Can I believe you? Or was it a lie? Say something! Hey. Hey! Jerk! You're so mean! Lie if you have to, but say it again! Miyamoto! Say something! A guy like you is all I have so vulnerability is my only weapon! Oh just shut up! What are you doing? Shut up! I'll make love to you. I'll take it off. OK. It doesn't have to be today. Out of my way. This smells like him, so... Make me your woman. I will. Something wrong? Then here goes. What? Sorry, sorry. Come on, be serious! Because... Because what? I feel kind of shy, stupid. Please, Miyamoto. Do you have condoms? Yeah, but... Where are they? - Don't use them. - But... Please. All right. You're my woman. Why? Hey, you're still hard. What the heck? It's moving around in a weird way. Gotta go to work, Miyamoto. Today's a holiday. You have to work? Oh no! I'm so sorry! I forgot. My goldfish died because I got to have all the fun. What should I do? Oh my god, what should I do? It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Is this enough? Yeah. That's good. I feel happy. I'm happy. I'll do my best. You're embarrassing me. Stop it, Miyamoto. You beast! Why? I really feel profoundly happy. The balance between happiness and unhappiness is remarkable. Yeah. Oh, the dentist. I made an appointment for 8 p.m. Monday. OK. Get temporary teeth before we go see my parents. But Yasuko, how did you manage to get 400,000 yen? Well... Probably... Probably? What do you mean? I mean... a distant relative of mine, a woman, is going to lend me. By the way, Miyamoto, what will you say to my parents? Please... Please let me... Let me marry your daughter. That sounds so formal. What's so funny? Of course it is! Awesome! What's with that grin? You don't get the joys of traveling. It's just nostalgia for me. A kid from grade school lived here. Yeah. Yamazaki's place. Yamazaki? Yamazaki. Are we close? Oh, right there. No way! "Nakano Electric Factory." Are they in? Are they? No, they're probably working. Miyamoto. Take a deep breath. Hey, stop making fun of me. - Wow. - He's trying too hard. I like how you drink! Have some more. Don't give him too much. He can't hold his liquor. You should obey moms. Yes, I agree. So, when's your due date, sis? Ow! Don't pinch me! Next April. You probably heard from Mom. Hey, I made it easier for you. Geez, what a thankless role. Ask them, Mom. Yasuko. Um... Are you in good health? Yeah, I'm fine. Less morning sickness than I expected. Traveling so far when you're 4 months pregnant. Mom. It's my kid. I won't conceive such a weak baby. OK then... I hope you're right. How annoying. That's not what you wanted to ask! "Is this guy marrying her," "to take responsibility for getting her pregnant?" Mizuho! That's enough! Um... I love her. I love Yasuko and the baby. She's going to start crying. More, please! What a lovely young man you are. I'll be on your side. And I'll be on yours. - Thanks. - What the heck? I'll take your side too, brother-in-law! My right side or my left? I'll take your right. Then I'll take your left. Hey. What did Dad say? Dear. Your dad? Hello, I'm Hiroshi Miyamoto. I'll make her happy. I'll treat her right. I'll spend my life with her. Please let me marry Yasuko. I'm counting on you. Thank you, Mr. Nakano. That's such a waste! No way I could do that! No way! I couldn't start farming now! Sure you could. I'm not ready to get into farming. I guess not. It's impossible. You need to settle down before you do. Who said you could start eating? Scold me, too! Mr. Jinbo, she's six months pregnant. Don't you care about Midori? Sure I do. Do you know how frugal your wife is when grocery shopping? She's right. Hey Yasuko, slap my left hand too! Come on! Shut up. Sorry! Sorry! How pathetic. - Yeah, shape up, man! - Shut up! Go to a farm! Yes, the door's open! Who's here? Corn! Hi! Hey! Miyamoto! This arrived at the company for you. Miyamoto, long time no see! So you're here too, Yasuko! Hi, Miyamoto... You haven't told them? Miyamoto! What? Oh no. Whoops. You can't be serious! Whoa! How did it happen? Hey, I've never seen Yasuko look so sweet before! I was secretly your fan, Yasuko! I never imagined she'd go out with Miyamoto! Hey, shut up. OK, let's make a toast! Oh, whatever! Ready? No questions asked! You can have mine. Here, Yasuko. Give that back. Miyamoto. How's work? Is everyone OK? Everyone has lost heart after you left. Then you have to get it together. Hang on a sec. Here, take it. My lucky tie. No, I can't accept it. Miyamoto. Work is what counts. A fulfilling career is the most exciting. Let me act like a mentor for once. I couldn't do anything for you. No, that's not true at all. Hey, you! What? Give me a break. You better treat Yasuko right, man! Let's go drinking! No way. "Treat her right!" "Treat my Yasuko right!" His face is overbearing. Whoa, naughty. Young people do that in public like animals. 24 and 26 years old are still young. I can't kiss in public... What? That was exciting! Gosh, I can't believe you just did that! Hey watch it! Is that how a true Japanese man acts? What? You know something? I'm so glad I visited you all. Mom is here, Dad is here... and Mizuho is here. You're... You're the champion of families. You're astonishing! ...No, wait... Astonishing? Ouch! Oh man, that must have hurt! You're laughing too much. Come on, what are you doing? Is he asleep? Whoa, that was fast! Your husband is amazing. Wake up, Miyamoto! It's not even 9 o'clock yet. Don't be mean and let him sleep. He must be tired. Why don't you take a bath, Yasuko? I'll lay out your futons. Dad, I'll pour sake for you later. No thanks. Oh yeah, you like to drink at your own pace. Typhoon No. 23 is... traveling slowly due to the high pressure system... Dad. You're still working at this hour. Yeah. We haven't been to that beach where we saw lightning for years. That's true, come to think of it. I'll leave on the 3 p.m. train tomorrow. When you left for Tokyo, didn't you promise me you'd never do something like this? Sorry I'm late, Miyamoto! You're so late. What? But we didn't ask you to come! That doesn't matter. Of course it does... Mr. Miyamoto, you have to know when to give up. Hey. You're 15 minutes late. Apologize. Huh? No, Yasuko, sorry... Do it. This is Mr. Mabuchi at Izumiya Construction and Mr. Ohno at Taiyo... It's OK. I understand. I apologize for being late. Come with me. Yes. Hey. Hi. How many? Four. Use this. Thank you. Sorry. Hey. This is Kuma. Hello. Iijima at Taiyo Confectionery and Saito at Yanaga Corp. Nice to meet you. Plus Ohno and I and we're the company rugby team. "Sweet Chocolates." Five old players. So you all play rugby? We took over a team started by some young guys. They don't know how to take things seriously. Hey, Mabuchi, stop being mulish or young people will dislike you. If they dislike me, I'll just hit them. Here you go. Mr. Mabuchi, you make the first toast. OK, but first... Hey, this is our new member, Miyamoto. No way, I never said... He's a tough salesman who cold-called our office. Come on, man! Show some mettle! Show some mettle! And! And, the beauty in the pitch, Yasuko. Not. Hold on, you can't do this. Mr. Ohno the procurer! Go! Go! There he goes! You're good, Miyamoto! Go, rookie! OK, that's enough. Miyamoto, that's enough. His eyes are rolling back! Miyamoto! Miyamoto, that's enough! Miyamoto, that's enough! OK, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing, captain? "Higuma" Sorry for hitting him. Sometimes a guy has to take a punch. Hey. Stay there, you're drunk. Your bust is 84 cm, waist is 58 cm, and hips are 85 cm. Not. First had sex after 20 years old. 7 partners so far. You have 30 boring underwear. Was never a rebellious teen. Hey, Miyamoto. I'm OK. Takuma. We're drinking at Higuma so come now! Hey, why did you call him? To introduce them beforehand. He can drive them home. Oh, hello? Whoa! Give me. Oh, Takuma? Where are you now? Who's Takuma? Mr. Mabuchi's son. Iijima! Say he's my disciple before anything else! Takuma Mabuchi. Somei University rugby team, a monstrous number 8. Don't make me say it again! How long? Come now! Mabuchi, give me the phone. Let me handle it. It's OK, don't worry. This is your instructor! It's not a drag. I've procured an older woman for you. A hot one this time. Her figure is 84 cm, 58 cm, 85 cm. Quite a looker. She's hot! Oh yeah Takuma. And another thing. A rookie member of the Chocolates insists that you're basking in old glory and that your junk is wearing a turtleneck! Hey, Takuma. Get over here! Hey. Here he is. We're leaving! Ringside seat! I'll back you up. Mr. Ohno, you should retire. Shut up. Go easy on him, you dumb-ass. Takuma, this is our rookie, Miyamoto. Hi, I'm Takuma Mabuchi. Call me Takuma. Takuma, it won't open. Unlock the door. Hey! I feel sick. I feel bad about making you do this. Being with Dad must have been awkward. Don't be silly. Your father is a fine man. You like guys like that? He used corporal punishment, so I don't get why you'd say that. You can tell I have bad taste in men. - What? - Never mind. It's difficult, isn't it? The exam to become a security sales rep. Yes. I'm not very smart. I know what I don't like but have no aspirations. Stop. I don't like negative talk. No, that's not what I meant. How do I put it? You're radiant, Takuma. No way! That's not true. That's all. - Here. - Thanks. Well, I guess you are radiant, Takuma. From his point of view. That's not true. I quit rugby just to defy my father. After playing a long time for no particular reason. Maybe your dad forced you, or you chose to keep playing... Either way, there was a reason. Which do you think it is? A guy your age shouldn't be talking like that. A relative of mine is a diplomat, and he said one time when he was drunk. "I fight with our nation on my back." And Dad just looked kind of bewildered. Good, huh? Yeah, good one! You hang in there, Takuma! You're a good egg. Excuse me for a sec. Oh, man. Miyamoto! Miyamoto! Get out. Get out! Get out! Yasuko? So hot. Oh, I'll get a drink, too. Sleep well? Hey, I didn't bring any money. How absentminded. You're so pathetic. Yasuko, are you angry? No. Just disgusted. Huh? Did I do something? Yasuko. Nothing. You were just asleep. Hey, tell me. You couldn't help it. You were asleep. And? Say it so I can understand! No, you don't understand. Because you were asleep. What's so bad about that? Nothing. You didn't do anything wrong. But... I absolutely hate you! Why? Yasuko. Huh? What? I was raped. Takuma? Happy now? You said so many good things about him. What's with that face? It's too late to look like that! You were snoring and asleep looking stupid. I won't allow you to be angry! And don't feel sorry for me! Get lost, Miyamoto! You and I are through! You can't follow up on your own words. I thought you were going to protect me. Yasuko! Yasuko! Yasuko! I want to touch you! How dare you say that! Let go. No! Let go! I'll never let you go! Shut up, let go! No way in hell! God damn you, Miyamoto! If you use force to overpower... a woman like this... and she stops struggling, is she yours? Are you like that, too? That's not my intention! If that's true, then let me go! No! I won't! Then be my guest. Go ahead and fuck me! You rape me, too! Once or twice, what's the difference? I won't do something so bad! What do you mean, bad? So what happened to me was that bad? Something so irreparably bad? Something so bad that upsets you more than me, the person it happened to? Hang in there... Hang in there, Yasuko! I can't believe you have a hard-on! Some nerve, pervert! Huh? This! What the hell is your problem? You... Does being raped make you so great? Does being raped make you a queen? Stop making a big deal out of a hard-on! Are you out of your fucking mind? Show it to me, Miyamoto! Hey. Wake up, Miyamoto. What's up? I'll show you the most beautiful thing in town. Are you sure? Yeah, this isn't good for your health. It's really OK. Here. It's all beat up, but... Wow. You know... it's not working out. What? Here, use the umbrella. You'll get wet. Yasuko, don't. Yasuko. Lightning will strike. Huh? No way! This place... Yasuko, wait. My dad and I used to come here. Yasuko, let's go home. Yasuko! Miyamoto! My dad isn't happy at all about us. Why? He gave us permission. Your mom accepted us, too. And the baby. We put a strain on your mother. She was concerned about us. She was worried about you, and about your teeth. So I... really wanted to fix your teeth, and borrowed 400,000 yen from Yuji. No way. Why that jerk? Miyamoto! You're not angry, are you? You're going to bear it all and be a parent. You have to become stronger. I'm living for two right now. You can't beat me. I'll kill him. You can't complain. I'm the victim. Stay out of it. It was me he insulted. You stay out of it. 9 a.m. Mabuchi and Takuma are coming to pick us up at 9 a.m., right? I'll kill him then. There's no way he's coming. Doesn't matter! I'll kill him anyway. Since this is all about you, you're just annoyed that he wounded your ego! Isn't that right? Maybe so at first. Then why not go to him right away? You're scared! You have cold feet! No! I was so drunk... I can't remember! I don't know where he lives! So you can suppress anger for those reasons? That's not all, you idiot! That's not all, you idiot. I don't even remember what he looks like! Your face... Your face is the only thing I can recall. Yasuko. Kill him, Miyamoto. Is something wrong? Where's Takuma? He's going with friends. Where's the woman? There's no place for a woman in this. Takuma is coming today, isn't he? That international U18 match he played in was awesome. He creamed 3 players on the other team and scored! That was amazing. He tackled Mr. Ohno and me and sent us both flying the other day. That was beautiful. Don't tell them. But it's too bad Takuma decided to retire. Although that's why we can play with a celebrity. Oh there he is. Hurry up and change! Takuma, the game is about to begin! Fujishima, the parking lot's beyond the field. OK. I recognize you! Hi. Hold on, you bastard! What do you want? You want to talk? Do you have to shout like that? I've studied some law if you want legal advice. Start driving slowly. Hey, where's what's-her-name, who promised to be the team assistant? She breaks promises, huh? Step on it. Why is he shouting? Park it wherever. Miyamoto! Over here! Wait, you bastard! Hey. Wake up. I'll slug you again. I'll slug you again, moron. Do you understand? You can't win. Don't come near me again. You can't win. Understand? Sorry I'm late. What took you so long? Hey, didn't Miyamoto follow you? He did, right? Yeah, I saw him, but... Three of his teeth are broken. My first punch landed squarely. Miyamoto, can you get up? What was the reason? Reasons to fight are always the same. We both couldn't back down. Higuma, three-six-four! Push! Push! Oh, man... I've lost... I've lost my teeth. Now, could you move down a bit further? OK. Relax. More. OK, I'm going to use an instrument now. Regarding diseases, you'll probably be OK. There's no need to worry about the wound. But if you sense something wrong after this, please let me know. Um... Thank you. By the way, Ms. Nakano, you're pregnant. What? But... The bleeding is threatened miscarriage. Miscarriage? It's a warning sign that indicates you could be losing your baby. You're in your fourth or fifth week, so take care of your health. Ms. Nakano. Yes. You're already a mother. "To Yasuko Nakano," "I'm so sorry for not giving you a word of apology." "I can't see you for a while." "Hiroshi Miyamoto" Miyamoto? Hey. I had to come see you. Hirose told me. She said to hear the rest from you. You must have felt terrible. Don't touch me! This brings back the 4 years we were together. Please don't touch me. I'm probably not thinking straight now. Come here, Yasuko. Come to me. Yuji. Good girl. Good girl. You're still an incredible woman. Tell me everything. I'll help you out. Tell me why you fought. I demand you tell me what he did. Here you go. I forget. Enjoy. Frankly speaking, I'm just here out of curiosity. Feel free to tell us. Your duel with Takuma is done with, and you took a good beating. I don't have anything to say to either of you. A guy who starts a fight he can't win might seem courageous, but is actually quite cunning, is my theory. And if you thought you could win against Takuma, you're stupid. Fine, I'm stupid like you say. If you'll excuse me, then. How much is the coffee? Wait, we're not done talking! There's nothing to talk about! If you hadn't come... What do you mean? I've nothing more to say! Why won't you tell me? It's a secret! None of your business! Miyamoto, try to understand a father's feelings. Who the hell cares? At least hear us out, in a calm manner. From Mabuchi's point of view, his son is rebelling against him and playing innocent, and you won't tell him, so he's up against a wall. My theory is that there are 3 types of male anger. First, is the "son of a bitch" kind where his mother is insulted, the second is a dent to his ego, and the third... This is the messy kind. Women-related. Yasuko... Nakano-related. I'll kill you all. You just want peace of mind. Want to trust your son? Be prepared to go down with him. There's no room for you to butt in at this point. What good is a father in all this? No other company would tolerate a guy with a face like that. Times like this, I feel like dying. Work sucks, I have no money and no woman. It's demoralizing when there's nothing but pain. But lucky you, you're happy. What the hell do you mean? You're lucky you have a woman. Shut up! I'm too overwhelmed to deal with you. Having your very own toilet changes you. I'll kill you! Get out the car! I'll break your teeth! I'll break the ones you have! You can't beat me, you wimp! What, admitting defeat already, idiot? I'm no good if I'm only equal to you. Who do you think you are? Tajima, have you ever been in a fight that you had to win? What, that guy you fought the other day? Knocked out with one punch. Three front teeth broken. And then another punch right there. His fist was like a bowling ball. How many ounces? So pathetic. It stings, damn it. "Marukita Co. Ltd." Hey! Good job! What are you doing here? I've brought you a bombshell. What do you mean? Pay up. Don't be ridiculous! I heard directly from Yasuko. Poor Yasuko, she was sobbing on my shoulder. Why were you two seeing each other? You're the one who decided not to see her for a while. So I came to inform you in her stead. About the new bombshell that she's carrying now. See you later. Tell me what happened to Yasuko. How much savings you got? Don't change the subject! I'm asking because it's related. Just answer the question. Probably... less than 70,000 yen. How many teeth did Takuma Mabuchi break? Fake teeth aren't exactly cheap, you know. Listen, money makes the world go around, Miyamoto. Demand compensation from Mabuchi's old man. This isn't about money. Besides, it has nothing to do with his dad. Oh, really? OK, I'll tell you. For 10,000 yen extra. You dirty bastard! I'll just leave if you won't pay. What? Hey! Hey! I'll pay you back today so lend me 10,000 yen now. Tajima! Tajima! All right, all right! I'll lend you! Wait there, got it? Tell me what you know. Yasuko is pregnant. She doesn't know yet if it's mine or yours. You can't decide this based on momentum or sentiment. It's no fairy tale. Birth, marriage, happily ever after. People can't live like that. If you care about her, abortion is the best way. Miyamoto, here's 10,000 yen. Give me that! Did you say that to Yasuko? Yeah. What did she say? Well, she probably agrees. Hey, the box. I guess I'll get going, then. What's all this about, Miyamoto? I... I'll... I'll... keep the baby and get married! What the hell, Miyamoto? Oh my god, Manager! Miyamoto just... went and... kicked his ass! Miyamoto! What's going on? Marriage! Birth! You can't stop me! Marriage! Birth! Have a problem? Stop me if you can! Tajima! I remember being tougher after I cry! Damn that son of a bitch! Excuse me. It's now or never. Yasuko! Let's get married! Seriously, let's get married. Miyamoto. Don't say a word! I heard. Leave it to me. I'll take responsibility, so let's get married! I'll pass on that. Don't pass! Marriage, Yasuko! Get married or whatever alone. That's not marriage! Marriage! Let's get married! Marriage! Marriage! Shut up! Say something else! Can't think of anything else, damn it. You're pathetic. You're so pathetic! I get it, but calm down... Yasuko, be true to your feelings! Answer him honestly. What the hell are you talking about? I get it, but you know her... Yasuko! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I won't! We should be together! What's the point if we're not married? There's no point in being together. There isn't? No, there isn't. Well, there is for me. I love you. I want to be with you. Then tell me something. What am I to you? Me, me, me. All you talk about is yourself. That's because I... I mean... Find a way to deal with your emotions on your own. I'm not as naive as you think. I... I'm... the father... The father of your... - Let's go. - It's OK, Hirose. But Yasuko! It's my child. I'll give birth and raise it on my own! I'm... the mother! So sorry to cause such a scene. As you just heard, I'm actually pregnant. - Congrats! - Thank you. Yasuko can be really stubborn. I think you should leave. Hey. So you came. Thanks for coming. What the hell happened? According to his wife, he grabbed Takuma in his sleep. "What did you do to Yasuko?" "What do you mean?" Neither backed down. Ohno, let us talk alone. It's OK, just go. Where's Takuma? Why do you want to know? Tell me. I'm despicable. I ought to have questioned him before you. I really think so. I know I'm biased, but I don't care. Takuma is still my son. So you love him that much, huh? Yes. You... you've spoiled him rotten! What price are you willing to pay to say something so idiotic? My own life. Don't be so goddamn easy on yourself! This is the result of risking your life? I know you're not that weak! He might be your son, but to me you and Takuma are total strangers! So you risked your life, great. But... I can't afford to lose, either. I'm going to be a father. I have to take my life into my own hands to become a father! I'm pretty psyched up. I'll let you risk your life caring for your son soon, so brace yourself and wait! A pen. Hand me a pen and paper. Answer the door. Takuma. What the... There you are. Bring it on, you bastard! Miyamoto, I'll call the cops. Want me to tell them everything? Go ahead. I could just do that right now. Takuma. Come on, step outside. Miyamoto, you promised me. Don't come near me again. I never promised. Tell me exactly when I did! Come out, asshole! Hey! Go away! You're a nuisance! Just go away! You know what he did? I don't want to hear it! Just go away! Go away! At a friend's place. Don't worry about that. How's Dad doing? I see. Mom, I really didn't do anything. I'm going home now. I'll call again. I have to go now. Bring it on. Miyamoto, are you sure about this? It won't be just your teeth this time. Miyamoto, there are some things... some things you just can't win no matter what. Oh my god! No! Don't! I'll die! I'll die! No! So drop dead, moron. Miyamoto, are we finished? Then I'll break your fingers. There was a guy who endured three broken fingers. Will you stop bothering me? Never... I'll never stop! Shall I break another one? Ow! What the hell, man! You really make me sick. Hold on a sec! I won't let a jerk like you beat me! No, don't! This is only the beginning! Wow! I'm so great! Oh, is coffee OK? "Pregnancy and Birth Guidebook" Miyamoto? Miyamoto! Oh, Yasuko! Yasuko! This jerk's in pain! Shut up. Yasuko, I'm... I'm hurting all over, too. Get over here! Marry me. Oh come on, just marry me, Yasuko. Stop mulling it over and answer me, damn it! I'll never marry you! That's my answer! I don't ever want to see you again, asshole! - I mean, what... - That voice. That voice is awesome. I shouldn't laugh. Go ahead and be proud of yourself. I never told you to fight or bring him. It's just annoying if you did it for me. Oh, it wasn't... It wasn't for you, it was all for me. I intended to antagonize everyone in the world. So you were... Even you were my enemy, Yasuko. Why did you come? What do you want from me? I want you to praise me, Yasuko. Help me! Ow. Help me! I'm appalled at you. That's fine. Please! I hate you! I don't care if you do. Call an ambulance! Shut the hell up! Want me to call a hearse? Sorry. So Yasuko, I'm so great, I'll make you and the kid both happy. I don't mind if you hate me. I don't care what you think of me. But I'll stay by your side for the rest of your life. I won't be so cheap as to say let's work together. Just me is enough. The kid is mine. I'm the greatest dad ever! I'll splash out and make you all happy in one go! Because I have a rosy future! But... I'm sure of it! That's my kid. Don't worry, I'll be there for you. Don't cry, Yasuko. Yasuko, it'll be OK. "Hinagiku House" These days, the baby moves around a lot. And they can hear now, so we should be careful. Don't use vulgar words, Miyamoto. Did something happen at work? You seem down since you came home. I looked up at the stars, and it was the winter sky. That's so gross! Caught a cold and I hurt all over. Ow. Here you go. Now I'm done paying you back. Thanks for your patience. OK. Good job. Bye, then. Hey, hold on a sec. You know, you always take off as soon as you pay, but that's not very mature. Huh? I'm still working right now. It's snowing, Miyamoto! Just kidding! Hey, how's Yasuko doing? Baby's due soon, huh? Everything OK? Yeah. You better not betray her at the last moment. What? I mean, you must have misgivings. I'll clap my hands in prayer in the hopes that kid is yours. There's no need for that. It's none of your business. "I'll be here if you ever need me." Tell Yasuko that. You can't beat me! Oh, man... Bye. Bye. What the heck? You could trip and fall or something. I'm bored now that I'm on maternity leave. You paid him back? Yeah. Oh man, it's all hitting home at this point. I'm sorry to cause you trouble. I'm sorry, Miyamoto. Don't worry, everything will be OK. It'll be OK. Any ideas for a name? A name, huh? What should we do? Yasuko! I'm right here! It's OK! The baby's coming! Don't worry! I'm right here! What should... What should I do? Stay with me! Grab harder! Grab me harder! I'm scared! I'm scared! I'm scared! Nothing to be scared about. Everybody who's alive is tough. Are you OK, Yasuko? Uh, will my wife be OK? There's so much blood. Will she be OK? She'll be fine. What about the baby? Don't worry. Calm down. There's a step. Hey, use my... Use my life! I've lived mine enough. Please move. So please, save my wife and child! Use my blood, organs, anything. Please! Don't be ridiculous. Miyamoto.
