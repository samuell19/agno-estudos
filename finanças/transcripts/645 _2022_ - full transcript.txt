Hey, what are you saying? I don't know. 5.7 billion. South Korean soldiers.Hello. How hard is it to work on the front desk all day and night? We, the guards, are here with warm love and consideration from the awe-inspiring Commander Comrade. North Korean soldiers, there's a weather forecast on the supercomputer of the Korea Meteorological Administration. It will rain in three hours. With the affection of our compatriots, we inform North Korea that there is no other supercomputer. Hey, what are we gonna do about this? According to our North Korean scientific satellite\NGwangmyeongseong No. 2. It's not raining. Our comrade fart man(Bang Kwi Nam) soldier leader and I have developed a lot of feelings in such a program, he has no taste and dryness, his name is also very rustic, we have prepared three lines of poetry for comrade fart man, you wanna hear it? IU from North Korea prepared an acrostic poem. Of course I'll have to hear it. Fart, farting boom boom. Kwi, Kwi-nam. Nam, South Korean hot pants. Hot pants.. Comrade Yeonhee, take it easy. Since IU sent us an acrostic poem. I should send you a reply with an acrostic poem. I know. IU is the most beautiful singer in South Korea. Should I say the first letter?\NAh. She still think she's pretty. Yoo, I'm sorry to hear that. Sergeant Park! A South Korean soldier who only judges people by their looks. Don't you have a girlfriend? You're very angry. But even angrier if you heard this? That's what, 10 years of military service? What should I do?\NI'm about to be discharged. Where's medicine. unable to get rid of the nasty sickness. If you play around like that, you're likely to end up in an acorn. Irrational madness.\NThat's it. Come on! Come on! - It's not a coincidence.\N- Loyalty! What's that? I think our GP has soldiers of interest. Soldiers of interest? Sergeant Park Chun-woo is a bit weird these days. Park Chun-woo? A real rich man doesn't ignore others. A positive attitude of keeping dignity. That's the real elite. It's a good story. Well, can I go to the bathroom? Why are you asking me that?\NAsk your old man. It's not small, it's big. You're doing a good job.\NYou're not supposed to hold back your shit. No! What am I supposed to do? Welcome, Comrade Lee Yongho. What are you looking at? I am just bored watching the German War movie. Watch it together? I've memorized everything now. I should've seen this more than 100 times. Chol-jin companion. Can I ask you something? I don't know anyone else, but I have to help Lee Yong-ho. I picked up a piece of South Korean paper. You know what this is? It's called 645. 645? If you get 6 correct out of 45 numbers, A vicious capitalist exploitation technique that fleeces the Korean people in the name of giving them huge amounts of money. But this is the day of the last drawing. Is this the latest piece of paper? Just for fun, take a look. OK. Okay, there it is. . Number one, three, and thirty. 3... 33, 36. Lastly, number 39. This is the number one. What's the matter, Comrade Chol Jin? It's... What is this? Yeah, well... What should we do? Yeah? I almost broke my back. The temperature is 21 degrees Celsius and the wind is from the northeast. The wind speed is 14 m /s\NA lottery ticket weighs 75 grams. If you plug in the formula for free fall. The flight distance of Lotto is 1.23 km. This is where the lottery is. What's going on? What? Just hand out the flyers! Oh. Hello, here. Put the gun down. I'm not gonna eat you. Okay? Come on. Put the gun down. What's your name? It's Park Chunwoo? My name is Lee Yongho. Sergeant Lee Yongho. Sergeant Lee Yongho. It's been three days since we met. I came out to meet my South Korean soldier. Welcome to Free Korea. What are you talking about, you stupid? But why do you keep talking informally? I mean you. Do you know the game called "645"? Out of 45 numbers, if you get 6 correct, you'll get 1st place. I picked up a 645. This is a piece of paper for first place. So.. I'll give you 10% if you bring the cash. I finally found it, thank you! Hey, North Korean soldier. That, that's mine. So give it to me while I'm being nice. What? Is this yours? Yeah, that's how I got here. Stupid. 934th, right? - Yeah.\N-1, 3, 30. Number 33, number 36, number 39, right? Yeah, so it's mine! Give it back! You Korean boy think I'm hot pants? And where does this note belong? Who got it who's the owner. What does that mean?\NWhat's that? Sergeant Park Chun-woo. When is your next shift again? - What's that?\N- Answer me, you jerk! Three days later, you punk! I'll see you here in three days. I'm gonna talk to you here again, okay? Wait. It hurts a lot? No. Are you... At night.. Did you meet a ghost and wrestled? No. But why do you walk around at night like a madman? And in a minefield you'll find if you go in. Wouldn't it be nice if you didn't explode? You cross the bars and you're in the brig by law. But you'll be discharged in a few months and you have serious mental health problems. I'm alright. No problem at all. But why cross the barbed wire every night like a madman. Wandering around the Demilitarized Zone, you punk! Five of the dog holes you dug!\NWho are you? Really son of bitch? Are you a spy? Nasty bastard. I'm not a spy. Don't you dare talk back to me, boy! I'll report to the main office first\NGo to the hospital for treatment first. Actually, I won first prize in the lottery. I was watching TV in the Home Office. Number 1, 3, 30, 33\NNumber 36 and 39. The prize money alone is 5.7 billion won. That lottery was brought to me by the battalion leader in the Jeep. He didn't give it to me. It came like fate. The recruits on duty together suddenly had diarrhea, and the ticket flew away. - Is that gone?\N-yeah! - So?\N- Well, so... So, go back a little, huh? Let me talk freely, huh? - The lottery flew to the north.\N- Yes, yes A North Korean soldier named Sergeant Lee Yongho picked it up. I'm Captain Kang, 437\NPut me through to the hospital. No, no, Chief. - A few days ago, at the Military Demarcation Line.\N- Yes. I met the North Korean soldier. But the guy only wants to give me 10%. That's a shame! That's mine. It's yours, so it's not making sense.\NRight? Do you have a helicopter now?\NWe have a critical patient. We need to get him out of here. No, we were supposed to meet the North Korean soldier in three days... Now the hole's blocked up. I can't see him. The dog holes are blocked up. It must have been hard? Can you at least send a truck if the ambulance can't stop? Look at my eyes. Yeah? We're going to the hospital. Hurry up. No. - I know I can't do that.\N- What? Look. I told you it's true. I won 5.7 billion in the lottery! Loyalty! TOD observation soldier\NPrivate First Class Kim Man-Cheol! I need to talk to my leader. You're just in time.\NYou use your computer a lot, don't you? Can you use TOD to detect fake photos? Computers have nothing to do with TOD. This guy's good. He faked a photo, huh? Let's go back. There's another one. 5.7 billion in North Korea? Sergeant Park. So you risked your life over the fence? You're really incredible. Hey, I'm glad I found it.\NIt's heaven's help This secret is carried to the end of the grave. - Yes.\N- Yes. In all battles, power analysis is the basic. If you know your enemy and know us, you'll win every battle. What kind of guy is that North Korean guy who picked up the lottery? A bastard. Bastard? Yes. For the sake of the party and the people. I thought this money should be spent for the country, of course. Same. What have the party and the state done for us? You're right. I wholeheartedly agree with Comrade Lee Yong-ho. Hard parents, my sister wants to be a singer's dream, I will achieve in the end. I have to change my dad's dentures first. Very steel alloy\NSwiss dentures. Change them all. Chol Jin superior soldier comrade. This heart must not change. Whatever it takes to kick that Korean son of a bitch's ass. Make sure you get back from your mission. You know I have a daughter, right? Doesn't have a piano that everyone else have. I came home one day. She drew the piano on the drawing paper with colored pencils. Sola Sola Redo. Can I give you 10%? One day my wife is going to pay my mother's medical bills I'm going to put mom in a nursing home, but I don't have the money or the piano. One day the kid said, Dad, why don't we have money? Can I give you 15%? With generous support and sponsorship for 15% of the shares, there is no better platoon leader. Sergeant Park Chun-woo. I'm a man of conscience, huh?\NLet's do it well. Manchul, what number do you like? Number? Maybe, 7? - Ok, give you 7%\N- 10. So the number 10, 10. Come to think of it, isn't that a nice, perfect number? Ten. Name is Ten. Ten. Ten 10, Ten. Sergeant Park! Park... What? Why is this open? I think this is a supply tube. The pipes are so old that they are often unclogged. There is no ice in the demilitarized zone even in winter. Only the supply officer knows the map of the springs and Wells. How nice would it be to open up and talk? On the south side is the Lost Property Act. I mean, there's all kinds of weird stuff going on. See, section four of the Lost Property Act. When picking up something lost by another. Compensation ranges from 5 percent to 20 percent. How great would that be? According to the law, you can claim compensation. Is that so? So I'm 80, you're 20. Get out. You really don't understand the language. You'll need an ID to get that. And even if you hold it, you wouldn't get any prize money! It is said that the period to collect the bonus is one year. You think there's nothing we can do? Search all defectors whose in-laws and relatives have settled in the south. We can find it, too. We win. You don't make any sense. Negotiations are broken. You bas...\NReally... How did it go? Where are those Korean motherfuckers? If we search the defectors carefully. We can find it, too.\NCan't we threaten him? If you read that right. I wouldn't have anything to say right now if you were sentenced on the spot. Comrade political instructor. Put the gun down. Where do you want to go? Yoduk political prison camp? Gaechon camp?\NPick one. That's where people used to sweat and bleed. The exploiters and the sectarians have come together. It's like coming back to home. Very warm. I'll tell you the truth, political instructor. Not long ago Comrade Li Yongho. Picked up a lottery ticket blown by the wind from Korea. What's that? I hear they give you a lot of money if you win. - The Korean people's...\N- son of... Political instructor comrade, the 645 won the first prize. The Korean kid who claimed 645 was his. We're negotiating a 50-50 split. How much is the bonus? The total amount is 5.7 billion won. How much dollar. In dollar terms... 6 million. What? 6 million? How much money are they gonna give us? It must be 900,000. Told us to eat 100,000. No,10...\NI'm really speechless. Aren't they thieves? You think the north-south issue is that simple? They always use brinkmanship. The negotiations have broken down.\NWhat should we do now? Negotiations are meant to be made up before fight. We're gonna have to reconnect. Does that give us an answer? Meeting is a precious thing. How earnestly are we waiting to meet? The depression of not having an answer is really overwhelming. I would like to speak to my compatriots in the North who do not sleep at night. Kiha & The Faces. Let's meet now. Uh, warden, there, there.. I've seen it too, punks. There must be a new number of people. People? What's wrong with them? It looks like Korean consonants. Korean initial consonants? Yes. Korean initial consonants? That's "k" in Korean. "K" in Korean. Oh, right, right, right. That, that k, d. Yes! - Hey, man, Manchul, you write it down.\N- Yes. "K" and "S". I, I. - Is it Chi?\N- Right, right, right Why do you keep rubbing your butt? If it's "k" and "d", then "military"? Chief, you're right. Army, yes, you and I are the same army, army! What about "K" and "S"? Military? Military. Army, military.\NWe're getting in, all right? After then? Together? Yeah? Courtship? A, Prison? Like a dog bird? A joint chest gay? High-dap chest muscles? You really have a poor imagination... Co-parasitic fruit.. Hey, is that imagination?\NLonely death zone. - Together?\N- Wait a minute Why? What's wrong? Who's in our GP that can go in and out of the Demilitarized Zone at will? What, the water supply officer with the key to the gate? Then they have a supply tube, right? That's it. Don't they have to bring water from somewhere in the winter? - That's right.\N- That's right. Here's the place they were talking about. Common. Water supply. District. JSA Common Water supply area. Hey, give me the medicine that the supply officer drew. Ah? You want me to look through it? Look with your heart and you'll find it. Heart? I'm really going crazy. Hey, where are you going? A single stroke between controls. You're not a chicken head, are you? Drop the gun. Drop the gun. So before we get to the talks, According to the principles of the UN Command, Weapons will be collected separately. Good. It's like our military academy. The lost and Found Act is bullshit. I'm here to sternly correct a thief who went mad after eating it. It's not 645, it's the lottery. You have to be clear about that.. Don't use USA language. This is not Korean land. Let me ask you a question. Do you know what the taxes are on the lottery? Tax? I knew this would happen.\NFor a skilled TA. In the future. The total winnings amount to N5.765772,844 won. Up to 300 million won, 20 percent of other income tax and 2 percent of N resident tax will total 22 percent. Over 300 million won, other income tax is 30 percent\Nand resident tax is 3 percent, or 33 percent. The actual amount received, excluding income tax and residential tax, is 3,914,959,762 won. You don't even know that. What about 80% and what about 90%? Show us, comrade Choljin. What is it? Lunch boxed meal? It's just a strong point that's easy to recognize. Strong point? Yanks call them PowerPoint? Our People's Army is beyond words. I just need one shot of drawing. Why bother to talk like that and look good? We didn't budge an inch in our opinion, so you know what? What if we don't take it? Then I have nothing to say. Get up, everybody. Here we go again! Brinkmanship again. In that case, do you think we'd be scared? And why do you own the lottery? You won't get the prize with it anyway. Do you know where to find the prize money? Is it not looking at the co-op? Agricultural cooperatives. Uncle, we're not a co-op. The Agricultural Cooperative is at the bank. The bank. Eight to two? That's a lot of concessions. Did you learn to eat for free from American wolves? Do you run the lottery? This is property issued by the Republic of Korea. You are illegally occupying our property, do you understand that? What do you suggest?\NIllegal possession? You're lucky you didn't go to the Azzo coal mine. Azzo coal mine? You punk!\NAre you done talking? Yeah, I'm done. Why?\NWhat are you gonna do? Scoundrels. I was going to make it good, but it didn't work! What if I don't do well?\NAre you trying to do it or what? You punks! We don't need any money! I'm gonna burn that guy's 645.\NI'm gonna burn him up! - I'm gonna burn it\N- Burn it! Those guys could really burn up. I feel depressed too. I've never seen such an ignorant person. Let's just, let's just do what they say. Hey, how can you say that? That's ours. Why is it 10% of ours? All I have to do is get the lottery back. Think about it. We have the ticket. What are they gonna do? Yeah, that's the right answer. Mr. Political instructor, are you really gonna burn 645? So we don't need the money either? So what do we do? Are you asking me to bow down to those useless guys? I should have taken 10%. Isn't that a lot of money for us? 8 : 2!\NWe won't budge any more! Fxxk 8:2.\N7:3. Who take the 7. Of course you. Did you say we're 7? Considering North Korea's difficult economic situation. We made a decision for the greater good. Is it true?\NIs that a fake account? So. Can we at least write up an agreement? Of course we do. The 645 agreement. Clause 1. The winning sum is Democratic People's Republic of Korea take 7\NIn proportion to the Republic of Korea take 3. Clause 2, even in the event of a natural disaster. Clause 3, if there is a dispute between the two Koreas. The International Court of Justice of the United Nations\Nis a court of exclusive jurisdiction. Clause 4, two copies of the agreement. The north and the south keep one copy after signing and sealing. Remember, it's either 7-3 or war. Just trust me for once for the sake of national prosperity. Wait. Just saying. What happens if you do not pay after we give 645? Those sons of bitches. Is that why we're making a 7-3 offer? That's what he was thinking. Put down. You got to let it go, stupid. I told you to let it go. I told you. If you don't let go on the count of three. I'm gonna rip your teeth out. OK. Do it. 1! 2! - 3!\N- 3! - Hurry up and find the lottery! Come on!\N- Take 645 away! 645! You sons of bitches!\NI'm gonna shoot you! - Shoot me! Bastard! Shoot!!!!\N-Manchul, where are you? Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights! It's because I know where it is when it'sound. - Move...\N- You out of your mind? - Chief, where are you?\N- Don't look for me, man! - Wait, wait, wait...\N- Come here. Eyes, eyes, eyes... - Stupid.\N- Stupid. - Bring it on .\N- What are you doing here? Just turn on the light, but it's dark. Did you see anything? These unnatural and helpless feelings. Good. Here, take a picture. Good. A little bit over here. Good. Isn't that the South Korean supply officer? Ah, ah!\NWhat are you doing here? Didn't we have a blockage in the water line before? I helped a lot back then. What's this? I've heard about what's going on. Sergeant Park, how much did you pay for it? I didn't. Didn't? Just picked it. - Hey, this...\N- Hey, be quiet! What? Pick up? Even your kids pick it up and you are claiming it? You son of a bitch! Well, I think... Because it's something that no one can claim. It's the Peace lottery. How about a 50-50 split? Five to five, we're good. A clean 50-50 split, huh? Good! All right, I got it. But it's not over yet. The north gives the South a lottery. I think the South will get the first prize back. But we have to transfer the money north again. But how are we supposed to trust each other? How about this? It's like a prisoner swap in a spy movie. The duration is 1 week. The North pays the lottery and the south gets its money back Before handing over the change to the North again. One soldier from the north and one from the south. That should do. Who's gonna go? All right, whoever goes! In case of emergency. How do you get in touch? My waist... You're alive. This is an ancient emergency network issued in this common water area since the Korean War. The cell phone of TA-312 A.K.A. Daughter. But both North and South Korea. There should be a phone somewhere in GP. Manchul, where are you from? Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul. I am also of the old school in Seoul. Sergeant Park, you're from Gangwon-do? Gangwon-do is not the same Gangwon-do. It's completely different from North Korea. Why don't I take the post? Manchul is not part of our unit. He was assigned to the TOD observation corps. Yeah right. Just 1 week. But that's not supposed to work, is it?\NHow do I get to North Korea? Let's play rock paper scissors. Manly, just one round! No, Sergeant Park.\NWhat kind of rock-paper-scissors... Hurry up and play rock paper scissors.\NRock paper scissors. Rock paper scissors. - Just one round.\N- Just one round Yeah just one round. - Hurry up!\N- Yes. Rock paper scissors. Wait a minute. Just once.\NWhat? The third round! Sergeant Park, what's wrong with you? - Manchul, I'm sorry.\N- It's the last time. - Where is that? Really?\N- Just one round, just one round. If I lose this time, I'll really go.\NJust one more round, huh? It's really the last round! Yes, just one round!\NI'm really going to go. Hey, I'm sorry. N-Last, last. You do it. Rock, paper, scissors. Yes.\NRock-paper-scissors paper! Sergeant Park, this is fate. Punks. Hey, I didn't do it right! I'm watching what you guys usually do. Let the sweat run like a river. If you roll your eyes like that, does your body flutter? - Be loyal! Be loyal!\N- Impossible. There was no place to hide from the sight of our fellow security instructors. Hey, you! Rack your brains. It's about to be executed. We should do something about it. Even though we sleep under the same quilt in the same housekeeping class. I wonder who is guarding the comrade instructor's lackey. Where we can deceive fellow security instructors in our posts. Not a single place. There is a place. The only place we can escape the murderous gaze of our instructor. Do you know what the most recognized ant is? Labor ants. A calf has only one life, and producing milk is also a battle. Milk 100 kilos a day. Be the best working cow in the Republic, you know? Comrade Yeon-hee,\NWhen did you come? Comrade Youngchul! Why are there wild boars? Lost Amy near the army not long ago. I saw him crying, so I picked him up. Does he have to be fed to eat, too? In the demilitarized zone. Don't wild boar and red deer make good egg fillings? Actually, I'm a little upset. Could something this beautiful eat me? Just a month, and you can grow a little more Brother! Brother! What? Here. What are you doing with your head? Hey, recruit.\NPut it up there. What? I didn't hear you! I said lift it up! Don't use your hands! Lift up the rope!\NPulled tight! I was scared at first. It was a terrible time. It was a terrible time. Because of the softness... - Recruit!\N- Private Kim Hyunsoo. Bring me a glass of water. You made a joke. But it's not fun, huh? What's the word used in South Korea at times like this? That's what I did earlier. - Gap, Gapbungyo? Gapbungyo.\N- Gapbungyo. It's a sudden chill! Gapbungyo is all of a sudden, the atmosphere is like the principal! I'm gonna die comrade! Again! Comrade Li Yongho, let's do it again. What's the point of Moonsong? I'm sorry I was born liberal arts. Good. Next, Honbabian. Honbabian... Who eats alone? Good job. What's a Honkono? Who goes to coin karaoke alone? Good. Now. What's bondalbonjum? Stir-fry the chrysalis... Bondalbonjum! If you ask for a number, I'll give you a number! I'm gonna die! That's it, this life is end, this life is end. Really, really, that's really, really.

Sergeant Park, put your hat on. It's a good match. Go as a private first class. What? Can you believe it? We're all in this together now. How can you not drink on a happy day like today? Comrade Choljin! Prepared the republic's most delicious rhododendron wine! I knew this would happen, which is why we've got drinks and food. I only prepared the most popular items of PX in the Republic of Korea. Okay, just a little bit more of the heavy flavor. Tie it up. DUDUDU. Now it's important. You watch it. Turn this end around! This is what makes tired soldiers want to eat. Taste it again. Give it to me. Let's have a candid conversation. It's all here. You know who's got the biggest ball? This is the bomb shelter.\Npublic water supply area. Stay. There is Panmunjom in North Korea and Peace House in the south. Then here. This is the back door to peace. The back door to peace? Is this make sense? This is the back door to future peace. Let's have a toast. - Come on, cheers\N- Cheers! Good! - My, my !\N- My turn! My! My! Hey, you just crossed the bridge. What did you say? The guy up there dumped you. Why are you so surprised? Is that how the South Korean president walked through Panmunjom? Okay, so our aggregate score is 1-0. - Now switch places.\N-Nice. Ah wait. Do you really want to change this?\NThis is North Korea. Have you been crying all night?\NSkip! Okay, let's skip it. Go, go. Ok ! Ok ! Focus! It's okay.\NYou're in the brig. But how old are you? In North Korean terms, I'm 29. I'm 32 years old. It's the big brother. You can speak freely. Ok? Let's get a cup from my brother. Yes, brother. But it seems your birth declaration was a lot late? I did it in time. What does Sergeant Park Chun-woo want to do when you become rich? I'm gonna start a farm. A cow farm. I graduated from the Department of Animal production. A dairy farm? Cows are pregnant for life to be milked. How inhumane. So I've decided. Cows need postnatal conditioning, too. I'm gonna start that farm. What will Corporal Lee Yong-ho do when you become rich? I have a lot of work to do. I want to buy a watch for dad. And my beautiful sister who sings well... Sister? Do you have a beautiful sister? Brother!\NWhat are you saying?

Yes. You have to get sick to get out. I thought a lot about it. Drink stale milk a year out of date. Food poisoning? But the way to get out of cleanly. Whether it's your right arm or your left arm, only one of your arms is broken. You can get out. Pick one that you want. What would hurt the least? It's going to hurt. I've already told you about it. As soon as you get out, you'll be taken to the N.K. Capital Hospital. You're just gonna get a month's cast, all right? Loyalty! - This?\N- No, no. Then, with this? No, why...

I always thought a zipper would be better. He was a revolutionary soldier in white with a single shot. An unbeatable army! Strength of steel! The vigorous Brawler! A lightning charge into the enemy's fortress. One man can ruthlessly defeat hundreds of enemies. The attacking spirit of a hundred is special defeat. This time the training.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, okay. What about Korea? Don't look down on me. Go away! A duck that can't even lay an egg. Can't ducks lay eggs? I don't know what the problem is. It's not breeding well. The farm thrives when eggs are hatched and young are born. Looks like I came to the right guy. I majored in animal production and mating. Atmosphere is important when it comes to breeding success. Atmosphere? You have to respect her personal life. The partitions and lighting should also be emotional. It would be better if there was music\Nlove songs and stuff like that. There's one of my favorite songs. It's that song. - Live with the moon and stars.\N- Live with the moon and stars. - Paradise of feeling.\N- Paradise of feeling. - You live with me\N- You live with me - This earnest heart\N- This earnest heart Comrade Yeon-hee.\Nwelcome.

Yes. What many people want to know is this. That's why mating is so combative. Please introduce the special secret of Comrade Choi Jeong-nam. To increase milk production from cows. The important thing is to rub it. Wipe! Is friction more important than anything else? Just pinch the breast of the cow like this. Use stroking to relieve accumulated chest muscles.
