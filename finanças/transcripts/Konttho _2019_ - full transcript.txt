Depression means low pressure! Rain comes with coffee – one or two cups. As I look through the window, evening sets in. Clouds gather like the yester days but no tears. A lone cup of coffee caged in your palms. I know the meaning of depression – sadness. You're listening to 91.9 Friends FM with Arjun … 'Mon Amar' … Let's see which friend is on the line … Hello!

What are you watching? It's very good! Come! Sleep broke in the world of sleep … A sweet murmur rose! Birds awoke on the boughs of trees, And bees on the flowers!

I need leave … I'll take leave … Want to know the kind of boy he is? You said it like an old man … isn't it? You put pressure on your voice … it hurt … Now to say it if we use the harmonium in our voice it would be easier. How is that? Last week I worked in two extra shifts … I've asked leave only for a day and … Have you noticed your grandaunt? Yes … As she is old … her feet totter… Likewise, if we make use of our voice harmonium … and touch the upper and lower 'sa' notes... Sa sa... What did you say? Oh no no … Went to Posta and heard... About your daughter's marriage... Get these ironed! Will you teach me? Sure! Everything is for you! You're my hero! Why are you smoking the cigarette? … Messed up the room … smoking in front of Tukai? Rightly served … Tukai has said he'll skip the evening tuition today! I've told all my school friends that my father is getting 'Voice of the Year'. … Getting 'Voice of the Year' … Gopal! Gopal, start off with Tukai … Go! Listen … we'll not have dinner tonight! Make something for yourself … On your way back, bring corn flakes for your little brother! Reads the note woven carefully with golden thread … Read the name, the place and the note … Laid it on her lap to read it a hundred times … The princess sat on her bed and thought … Who will garland me in this lonely retreat? The fragrance of your body fascinates me the most … Will not be able to kiss you amidst all in the award show … so let me do it now … From college social directly to radio play … Then there was poetry … and reading letters from listeners … And now our nights are never complete without listening to his voice … Ladies and Gentlemen … No … I'll not tell you the name just now … That person will be awarded by... an amazing personality … Mr. Barun Chanda … His baritone voice has mesmerized Bengalee audience through ages … Barunda … please … come on stage … Many thanks for coming here … Thank you! … And now the person I was talking about for so long … 'Ei Samay' Voice of Bengal powered by 'Siti Cinema' 'Voice of the Year'... award goes to...

I want a big big hand from all of you! Audience … Louder! Louder! Thank you Arjun! Thank you Barunda! Thank you so much … and in such moments, we get speechless... we get 'overwhelmed' … We'll move on to our next award … Child…on the first morn of your life... I introduced you to this entire world … That's me, and today I've cast aside all embarrassment, to tell you who I am! Lady, the light of your lowered eyes... melts my heart, as the sun's rays melt mountain snows! Your voice pierces my ears as a voice from a previous birth... and stirs strange pain. Tell me then, by what mystery's chain is my birth linked to you, unknown woman? Oh, be patient, child, for a moment! Let the sun-god first slide to his rest... and let evening's darkness thicken round us. Now let me tell you, warrior... I am Kunti. You are Kunti! The mother of Arjun! Fix an appointment with Dr. Majumdar… tomorrow morning! There's a growth in the throat … Biopsy must be done … CT scan … Biopsy report indicates … carcinoma … which we call cancer … CT scan is also positive … We had organized a Tumour Board meeting … with many doctors … The decision made is … we'll go for surgery! Although in cancer treatment chemotherapy … radiotherapy … that is radiation … are all there... But this is the fourth stage … Apart from surgery, there's no other way out. As a doctor, my objective is to save your life! There's one more thing, Arjun! No smoking! It's poison for you! The cancer is spreading pretty fast … Can't give you time … What's disturbing is... you'll lose... ...your voice box! I know it's very painful for you … because it's your profession … You're a radio jockey … A voice artist … Still … I'm repeating … Life, I think is much more precious than voice … You'll not be able to speak the way you did before … All other things you'll be able to do normally … Discuss it between yourselves … It's a very very difficult decision … But the surgery has to be done immediately! Zakir Hussain's hands are amputated … The eyes of a rifle shooter are plucked out … then try keeping them alive … what's the point? Keeping me alive, without my voice, is tantamount to killing me! I will be alive, but... I'll live like a dead man! I'll be a vegetable … isn't it? My voice is an asset in my life … Manoj, I'm living for the sake of it … What are you seeing? … What? I'll not let them operate on me, Pritha! I'll not allow the operation to happen … I'll die, if I have to … Pritha and Tukai … What about Pritha and Tukai? Tukai is only seven, Arjun … Do you want him to lose his father at this age? I'm not considering my life … For me what's important is not your voice, but you! You're the life support for us! Had it happened to me, what would you have done? Did you disclose to Tukai? Dad, I've come first! See … he's come first … My champion! So, my friend … Our friendship of twenty five years is coming to an end … So, let's say goodbye to each other … Let's make love for the last time! Haripada, the driver of Lalmohanbabu had taken a leave, so Feluda had to replace him. On the way, Lalmohanbabu said... "So you dumped a responsibility upon my shoulders, a binocular and two books" … Dad … is it painful? You need not read any more … Talk to me … Speak Arjun … Speak … say something … Please … Don't be silent … Say anything … I want to talk to you throughout this night … say something … please … My sad days walk the straight way... My happy days float... On such a rainy day, at every step I remember the day I died... My happy fields are steeped in water... My hard earned paddy dies... I remember the day it rained... There's no end to my birth! In this life … our conversation ends here... Pritha... In knee deep water My memories float. Life speaks … Everyone is silent. On my shoulder rests Your chin covered by clouds … Who painted this illusion … How wonderful it is! That great vagabond by joining mirages... Designs very far... A mound of light. Jockey? You mean … those who ride horses … Do you gamble in horse races? No no … It's radio jockey … I do radio anchoring … That means you lend your voice in the radio … Birendra Krishna Bhadra … Starved to death … now eat … As the night descends... No one can be seen … This white marble is so cold … In the discarded love bower who listens to whom... I send you inwardly... the early dawn. The silhouette created... by cutting the veins of sleep Silently walks... the firefly thief … Mrs. Mullick... Will you, please, come inside? Come! Sit … The operation has been successful … and the life of the patient has been saved … And that's the best part … The cancer didn't spread to the gland, it was confined to the larynx … No Pritha! You can't break down now! You've many more battles left to fight … Actually, the real fight starts from now onwards … See! The most important person in his life, is you! He loves you very much! But now, he'll despise you the most … Because he'll try to share his words with his dearest person … but when she'll fail to understand, he'll get exasperated. And Pritha! You, too, are a voice artist … The patient in room no. 451 is to be discharged today. Keep the bill ready. Mr. Mullick... If you press this bell, I'll respond at once. And this is a slate and a marker pen. If you require anything, please write on this. How are you feeling now? Feeling better? 'Speechless' Won't you write on the slate? Doctor was saying it's like your rice initiating day! I know … after laryngectomy you don't get any smell! The scent of 'Gobindobhog' rice … which you love … And boiled 'moong' lentils! Want to go home! We'll go! Hold this … And take the bag … Come! Careful! Welcome! Since you got admitted in hospital, aunty has come to stay here. You were captured by the royal disease … the royal disease! It's ok … Now I'm here … you come! When Sri Ramkrishna had this disease, Mother used to feed him with … SEMOLINA... She used to strain it and strain it … Or else she gave him lamb stew … Cooking it needs a lot of skill … SKILL … understand? At first you put the meat in normal water … And then you add some bay leaves and a little spices … And then you boil it until it becomes soft like cotton … Aunty … please … If you lie on a betel leaf bed... It sucks … SUCKS away your cancer … Why are you shouting? I can hear normally. Aunty … please leave him alone … please go… I'll call you later … Ok, I will go! What a dangerous disease has seized you, my child … Dear God, please cure my child! Hey hey! What're you doing? I … I'll take it... Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Should have kept the phone with me … Give me the phone … Dad! Tukai … Tukai … Tukai … listen Tukai … What has happened to you, my dear? What has happened? Tell me! That hole in dad's throat … it scares me … Now Daddy will breathe through that hole my dear … there's nothing to get scared! Like we breathe through our nose, dad will breathe through his throat! Will he not be able to speak any more? Who said he won't? Of course he will! We'll have to be at Daddy's side … encourage him … Never get scared again! Good boy! Rare cosmic event on a winter evening … After a lapse of 160 years … Super Moon, Blood Moon, Blue Moon … And total Lunar Eclipse … all together! In this lunar colour play, children are the most excited. All citizens are hooked to the sky to watch the changing faces of the Moon. Everyone has booked their seats on their rooftops. Tonight the moon will be 14% larger and 30% brighter than the other days. This evening all eyes are on the moon! Apart from India, this eclipse can be seen from other countries like Asia, US, Russia, North East Europe and Australia. I've told God... give back my dad's voice. I tell you... you'll be able to speak one day. Radiation ends today … And the whistling sound from his throat … which is a concern for you … I think it will get reduced in some time … Speech Therapy will start from now on. Why don't you have a look at our Laryngectomy Club? Better bring him tomorrow … We... can speak … in three different ways … TEP... They make a permanent surgery in the throat … Here in our country, people do not do this … because of pollution … The second one is called... ...electrolarynx. Listen carefully. Like a shaving unit, speak with the help of this machine. Machine... may fail. But... speaking with the food pipe … is original and natural … Our Laryngectomy Club... has an anthem … Let's hear it … The little boy says – o … a He has not learnt to speak … Tiger lives in the jungle … Bird lives on the tree … Fish lives in water … Will you not stay here any more? I'll not speak in such a distorted voice … For a radio anchor, this period is really tough … Better take him to Romila … the address is there … Should I call her? Arjun, you've to go somewhere … either to the hospital to do speech therapy … or take private training … Leave me alone … It says – right turn! This side … We're on the right path … Break! Break! Break everything! You're in such a hurry … Such a hurry – eh? You broke my lemon plant … Hey! Hey! Can't even hold the pot … why have they sent you at all? Why are you standing there like a wooden doll? Hold the pot … hold it! Ohh! It'll break! Today it's Potol's day or mine … Why are you pushing the bell, Potol? Come up, at once! This is your man for the pots – isn't it? I had told you to send minimum of two persons. It's taking my whole day … There're more than 50 pots … They've to be sent to Jhulandi's place today itself … Your man has broken my lemon plant … I'll give him a tight … My dad has had a throat operation … Will you teach my dad to talk? Actually, I used to hold the therapy sessions in private … But next week I'm shifting to Dhaka permanently … leaving Kolkata for good. So, it's impossible for me to take up a new case … Please go to this Beckbagan Institute … where there are other speech pathologists. Previously, I also was associated with this institute... here is their number … You can call them here … I'm extremely sorry … I'll not be able to take a case any more … Won't you teach my dad to speak? There are other doctors, my dear … they'll teach him … Desperately need private tuitions … Why me? Because you are the best … Look, I can't say that … but it's impossible for me to take a new case. Is this the time to come Potol? Your man has broken my lemon plant … My white hibiscus also has broken limbs … Weren't you supposed to send more people? Who will bring down so many pots? Tell me. Come at once. Aunty, nowadays you can see RJs on Facebook or twitter … previously, it was not like that. By listening to the voice, you thought he was handsome. Remember our RJ Diganta … You won't know … but you should! Oh yes! He looks just like me! Fat … pot-bellied … lost almost all his hair … but his voice gives you an impression of Clint Eastwood with Salman Khan … Whoever comes to the Radio Station, he would just run and hide, himself, in the office. I thought – what's happening? He would say – "Indranidi … please do not introduce me to anyone … everything will get messed up … Whatever I'm doing is only because of my voice … if anyone gets to see my potbelly and balding head … then everything will be finished …" It never happens to me... no fan ever turns up … Why didn't you take me along? So presumptuous! " It never happens to me …" How old are you that you'll have fans? What did the doctor say? Doctor is going away … Said she has no time … can't teach … Going away means? Remember … Arjunda used to make my boyfriend sit in the office to guard me? Your boyfriend with disheveled hair … how can I forget? Poor boyfriend … I'm calling up Dr. Majumdar just now … if required we'll go to Chennai … Mumbai … If needed, I'll take three to six months leave … Let's search … Arjun! Do you all know what happened with Arjun? Bundles of letters kept pouring at the radio station … One day, I opened a letter … it read … My darling, how are you? I can't live without you … Why aren't you picking up my phone? Are you avoiding me? I can sacrifice my life for you … I was thinking – Good Heavens … Give me the bag … let me … Why are you worrying? Everything will be ok. We'll search for other places … At the bottom, I found a phone number … I called up … What are you saying? What kind of a girl are you … You called her straight away? Aunty, listen what happened next … The phone was ringing … She picked up the phone … I said … Mahua? She said … yes … I said … Do you write letters to Arjun? She said … yes … I said … But Arjun is married … Just silence... Suddenly, she cried out, "It's a lie! You're trying to come between us"! Tell me, was I trying to come between you? Arjun! Come … sit with us outside … Not feeling well? Myself, Pritha and you … We started our career together in radio … Don't cast us away like this … You're my only friend at the radio station … Please leave me alone! No Mr. Arjun Mallick! I'll never leave you alone! I'll be with you! I'll never leave you! Mom! Granny had called … She wants me to visit her once, before going to Dhaka. Ok! Go! Everyone will be so happy! You know, I don't like it! I hate that house! I don't like to see my dad with anyone else … Don't you understand? Can't you see, that I hate that woman? Saheli, you are aware that we are, now, divorced! You can't compel your dad to do anything … He can do whatever he likes … But a marriage right after divorce? He couldn't wait? What kind of a talk is this? Mom, I can't be as generous as you … Have sent all the plant pots to Jhulandi's place today … Just taste it! Oh! How tangy is mustard oil! Like it? Oh yes! You, really, sent your pots Mom? You, really, could …? Yes... Arjun Mullick? Where did you get this? A patient had come … laryngectomy … I refused … You know, I can't accept a new patient … Mom … this is Arjun Mullick … So? Arjun Mullick … don't you remember? Who made us talk … when I was on the terrace … Oh! That's why he's not doing the show now … Open your mouth! Open! A little more … Great! Hello! Madam! This is Arjun … Arjun Mullick … from 91.9 Friends FM … I cannot talk to you just now … I'm extremely sorry … Madam! I'm talking to you about your daughter, Saheli … She's standing on the terrace and wants to end her life … I'm connecting you to your daughter … live … Hold on … Saheli, you know... there's a great surprise waiting for you today … Someone wants to talk to you … Mom! See if you can recognize her! Remember? Is this Arjun Mullick's house? I'm Romila Chowdhury … He and his son had come to meet me this morning … Please … come … He has closed the door! … Doesn't want to confront anyone … Has gone into total depression … Can you give me a piece of paper? … Pen? Ok! Just a minute! Romila Chowdhury … please open the door … RJ … do you remember... … I'd called you? I'm your fan … I'm Saheli … that foolish girl who stood on the terrace … Mr. Mullick! One night, you had connected me and my daughter … Have a lot of debts to square up … The gratitude that we couldn't show you that day … today … today we're here for that … Will you teach my dad to talk? You want me to do that … isn't it? I give you my word … your dad will speak again … Mr. Mullick … It is highly possible to talk after laryngectomy … but the cause of your depression is you'll not be able to hold radio shows any more … isn't it? Come! Together, let's take a challenge! You'll hold radio shows again … Yes! Waiting for a long time? No, no! It's ok. Your husband … let's not be formal … Sure … For your husband, I postponed my ticket to Dhaka. It was getting very difficult … How did you happen to be in Kolkata? I was born in Dhaka … Studied Speech Therapy in London … In fact, my... ex-husband was from Kolkata … Businessman … Fought my case of divorce for six long months … Got the custody of my daughter … Actually, I got tired fighting the divorce case … But I'm charged again with your husband's case … Tell me … what will you have? For me, Darjeeling tea … But I'll pay … This is my regular joint … leave it! Hey! One Darjeeling tea for madam … And my usual … Cold coffee with a lot of cream … May I... ask you a question? Yes... Tell me … Will Arjun, really, do a radio show? Actually, everything depends on Arjun … See … he'll be able to speak … but not like he did before … Listen … disease can take one of your lungs … but the other lung is there … if they take one of your kidneys … there's another one … you'll continue to live … but live in a different way … Actually, it's a little difficult for your husband … after all, he's a radio jockey … a lively young man of forty wakes up in the morning, to find that he can't speak … mentally, it's very shocking … he has to start afresh from the alphabets … ka … kha … ga … gha … English vowels … a e I o u Actually, accepting it is a bit difficult … Ok... tell me … when does Arjun get up in the morning? He used to get up at 9 … His recitation students come in the morning … Thank you … His previous routine has remained as it is … I've stopped the recitation class … Oh my! But why? Pritha! Everything has to be just like before. Everything should be normal … Suspension of the recitation class, will force Arjun into deeper depression … Resume it from tomorrow! And tell me … what kind of gift does he like? Now take the turn … be careful … Turn carefully … Bravo! Bravo! Very well done! How are you? I'm good … Didn't you come the other day? Yes... This side or that side? Faridpur … and you? Barisal … To come a pike … To go a pike... That's called Barisal… Where's my patient? Inside the room … Keeps himself confined the whole day … Such a fresh young man … What has happened to him … Now that I've come … just see what happens … Go! … Aren't you from Barisal? Then, where is the valour of a Barisalite? Grab the tail and bravely jump into work … Then, only will people say … a Barisalite father's Barisalite son … come! Come... From now on … this will be your style statement … There should be a slight gap, so that you don't have any problem in breathing. Like Dev Anand … ok? Now you'll wear this … And this one is extra! Today, we are going on a date … Your wife has, already, been informed! Let's go! I've extended my hand … let's go! Didn't know radio jockeys could be so unsmart! Come along! What happened? No! … No! Only the car key! Be careful! Careful... don't fall! Turn! Turn! … That's it! When will you return? How many times do I have to tell that I can hear? We are not doctors … Do you know what people call us?... Face physio … Not only laryngectomy patients … A heart stroke patient with a slurred speech … those who stammer … unable to get a job … all these are our patients. Nowadays, you don't get good speech therapists in Kolkata … Do you know why? If you have to interact with a patient … you'll have to know him, must give him time … personal training … and for that you have to dedicate one to two hours … While a doctor can see more than fifteen patients within that time... And in our case … only five … maximum six … If you've to leave your old beloved keep her number intact in your mobile. Learn to ignore it … If you want to give up smoking... do it, by keeping the cigarette packet on the table. Listen to the radio … feel the pain … enjoy the pain … but do not stop it. Consider yourself to be a retired hurt … And you'll come back … And you'll come back with a bang! Listening to the radio irritates him … he just can't stand it … the sound of radio … I feel guilty even while reading the news … But what can I do? … Indrani … I can't believe... the man who laughed so much … was so lively … planning the evening programme in the morning … discussing with you all … scanning the newspapers to select the topic … selecting songs to discuss in the programme … that man is... ...totally closed! Manoj please! Please involve him in something! Feeling very scared about him! Can't we involve him in writing scripts … I mean … he will write different scripts for the radio? It's a fantastic idea … Let's decide on a few topics, go and tell him … and take it forward … Yes! That's it! Very good idea! Mr. Mullick … you learnt your first words from your mother. Obviously with your windpipe … for the second time in your life, you'll talk through your foodpipe … sip the lemonade … sip it … Now... we'll hold a competition of who can belch better … Ok? Long, long belches … Belch beautifully, with ease … Start … Belch … Don't be ashamed … To belch is a normal thing … Belch! … Come on, belch! Yes! Belch! Long … large belches … with ease … I want it loud … There it comes … now do it … That's it … bigger … bigger … beautiful … Louder … louder … more than that … There it comes … beautiful belches … Nothing to be ashamed … nothing … Bigger belch … a bigger belch is wanted … Normal, normal, normal … absolutely normal … Listen… in our childhood, our mothers and grandma's used to say if you rub the back of the child, it will help him to belch … Now belch … belch … belch … Big belches … loud belches … That's it … Belch … Louder please … louder … more than that … Here it comes … Louder … slightly more loud … Great! now... With this belch, you'll say... 'Aa'! Just look at me … Do it! Yes, do it! Do it... Say it! What happened? Belch! Belch! Try it! Try it! Yes! Aa … aa … aa … Aa … try... Great! Excellent! Belching to speak is, actually, talking through the esophageal voice … that means talking through the food pipe … See! How... are... you? Now you go home and practice 'o', 'aa' and English vowels – a, e, I, o, u … After this you'll be given the 'First Book of Alphabets' … What are you seeing? What are you looking at? Mr. Arjun … five sessions hence from today, you'll speak your first word … To speak, there's no such tactics … Day and night, just practice and practice. Then, the herbal practitioner came and said … there's no remedy for this disease … and allopath treatment would not suit Thakur … And then, ultimately, Mahendralal Sarkar was called … Mom! Granny! Come come! Dad is speaking … What? I saw Dad speaking … Don't drag! Granny will fall! But I saw him speak! Come quickly! Speak Dad! Speak! Dad! It will happen! It was happening only a few moments back! Do it Dad! Do it! Dad was speaking Mamma … Looking at the mirror, I saw him speaking … Dad will do it! Dad will speak! Don't force him! Let him try on his own! My son! My dear! Hey! Speak here! No! You can't stop practice … a, e, I, o, u … you'll have to practice all the five vowels … if you can't say them properly, we're not meeting any more this week … Ok? Bye … Someone told me... the waves of this ocean Will drift me out into the sea … Where the shore is a little smoother … Covered by an all-encompassing light! Keeping myself mum, no one knows How am I living … Sometimes I wake up from my sleep … Are all of them singing in full throated ease? Covered by an all-encompassing light! Sun has its home in my heart... My eyes reflect my lust for life! My mind nests Himalayan hope... Never asked for a receipt for buying time! My God will recognize me I'm standing at His door! Dreaming the same dream everyday... Covered by an all-encompassing light! He is unable to bear it Romila! He's unable! He's getting tired! He lies in the room … doesn't eat anything! I help him in every possible way … But that's wrong! Why will you help? From now on, don't give him water with food … What? Let him ask for water! Let him make the first sound! Let him gesticulate … Communicate by movement of hands and feet … Stop sleeping with him … What? Yes. Let him ask for it! Switch off all lights, so that no gesticulation works! Let him make sounds! I can't do it, Romila! Don't you want Arjun to do radio shows again? Don't you want your old Arjun back? This is called Need Block Theory! Block all the necessary things in his life. Finish this... Chew properly. Eat! What do you want? Tell me! Say what you want … Wa…ter … Won't you sleep? Raise your voice! Romila! He said the vowels … just now … Now he is saying 'o' 'aa' … Listen! Can you hear? 'K', 'kh' … Say it … It's more like dumb charades … Each of us will say a riddle … Arjun has to give the answer … He has to speak it out. Right everyone? Right! Let's see what comes first! Aunty! Shall I say? Oh yes! I'll eat whatever you give me! If you give water, I'll die! Now, tell me who am I? I'll eat whatever you give me! If you give water, I'll die! Now, tell me who am I? Fire. Superb Arjun! Superb! Superb! We've something to tell you! In Barishal's language, these are called 'polki'. Tell him about the scripting … Polki means puzzle or riddle … which means 'couplet art'. In UK there's a radio channel called Fun Kids … They make a lot of programs for children Others are doing a lot of good experiments … We should also try and invent some new programs … Like Upendra Kishore, Sukumar Roy's stories, Lila Mazumdar … if we can make some radio plays based on their stories … See, you know it pretty well we're fighting with hindi programs … Bengali content is gradually getting eroded … it's reducing … I think it'll be a great challenge for us … Tell him Manoj … We should write a good script … Pritha! That should make a total difference … the show, the program, the genre everything … His name is a three-letter word … Hey Arjun! You've to listen … His name is a three letter word He lives in water… You cut the middle letter It opens its wings to fly … Who am I? A three letter word... Cut the middle letter... It wil fly away … 'Muittha' – the preparation that you love so much. She gave away the clue. Chi- Chitol … Excellent … Great Arjunda … great! My mother-in-law's gold bracelet is not with me … I've tallied the list and returned all the ornaments … Ok fine! I'll search for it again. See! Two things of my ex-husband are with me … One is a pair of torn slippers … And my wedding ring … Yes! I'll return them all! Why have I kept this? Why at all? Does it have an answer? Why do relationships end so badly -- can you tell me? So much of dissection …? Breaking up gracefully... leads to a new beginning... 'Some of my belongings' … This song doesn't fit into this situation … That you're an extremely cheeky person, a mischievous fellow – has anyone ever told you that? What happened? Can't you drive carefully? Will you die and kill me at the same time? What's wrong? What has happened? Talking in english! Why did you come this side? We are on the right side! You should have slowed down … not we … How were you driving your car? Talk gently! Don't you know how to talk to a woman? So what? Women have the right to kill us? Driving like an uncivilized person! You scoundrel! How great! Give him! Hurl more abuses at him … Come on! Say … say … revile … Rascal! Wonderful! You say full sentences when you are angry! This is the first time you're speaking in public … Oh! Thank you brother! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Let's go! Come! Abused me? Crazy or what? You did it! So proud of you! Two months after the operation, he uttered the first word. Yes! Gave the doctor a four letter abuse … I used fifty per cent of the word … fool … The scoundrel could not understand what I was saying … that's why … Depression... While driving, if I see... a policeman taking bribes, can't abuse him the way I did earlier … I miss that … Do you notice the similarity with you? Today he has called the taxi driver a scoundrel … O God! We should celebrate this over a drink! Do you drink? I'm a regular drinker … I had cancer in larynx … also in colon … I can't drink through the mouth … Hey! Let me! I have a pack attached to my stomach... I administer it here directly through the syringe … Rum … The intoxication is perfect! What is this … What impression they'll have of you? They want to know about me … I've to tell – isn't it? No... no! He was very depressed … Reviled even me … Once I dozed off in the hospital … he threw the pillow at me … Similarity here also … Splashed water on his wife's face … Heard that? Exactly like me … How fast he writes … Other things are all normal? Yes! Other things are normal … But What exactly do you want to know? Sex life...? Why are you pricking me? The earlier desire is not there … it has reduced … I was given 30 chemos … But you'll have your wife at your side … and you'll not caress her … can that possibly happen? She is getting angry! See she's running away … She's feeling shy … But this wife is everything … They'll be at your side till the last … Don't forget … Brought this sweet for you … Good! Keep it! Let me have one! Sure! First you? Pulak … our Pulak … that Maths teacher … his tongue has been totally operated … not one word can be understood! And, whenever, I visit him, he asks for money … Says – all his money has been spent for the disease … Strange! Did you ask me before you started smoking? You want me to pay for your sins? Nowadays, I feel scared to go to anyone's place … lest they ask for money … No! Here, of course, there's no such fear … What do you say? The entire share of property belongs to Arjun … Yet, he has kept, a room for me upstairs … nowadays who does that? Pritha hasn't returned yet? No … she's taken shift duty … Has to work for a longer time … Nowadays, Arjun doesn't have any work … Sad! Full load is on that girl … Now carry the burden of the entire family! Hush! Arjun has come! Hope, he has'nt heard us! Radio station is not sending him any money? Money! He keeps himself confined in the room … doesn't talk to anyone … People do not survive once they have this disease … That he's still living is a big thing … Very sad! The girl has to bear the burden of Arjun for the entire life … The child must be brought up! What are you writing? How disheveled is your hair … Am I... ...your... ...burden? What...? Don't you understand? Am I your burden? Burden? Please! Please! Sorry...! It's almost like shaving! At some point in your throat, there's a sweet spot … if you touch it, it vibrates … yes! yes! Speak! Louder! Has to be clearer! Yes, speak! Hello! A little more clear … Hello! Arjun Mullick speaking … Slightly louder! Hello, Pritha! Wonderful! I hate you! That's cute! Hello! Just like a robot! Where's the sound coming from? From here! Hemlata! Don't you've diabetes? And you're stealing sweets! Sorry! It's a mistake! I'll never do it again! Oh! I was so frightened to hear that voice! We're dining out after such a long time! But you'll have to be careful about the food! Medicines … rules … can't we talk avoiding these? Yes! We can! Like, today, you'll place the order … You can't make gestures or show the menu card … Myself and Pritha … we're dumb … We'll only nod … From now on … in all public places … you'll speak … In the market … or restaurant … For this reason … no one … will be able to … stay with you … That's why no one stays … Very unromantic … Please order … feeling very hungry … Hello! Excuse me! Two … Use the esophageal voice … Strange! You don't understand? Sir … please show us on the menu card … And we will serve you. Do you think leaving the table will work? Will you not see his fight with your own eyes? I can't see him like this … He needs both of us by his side … Mentally, you know that Radio Anchor Arjun can speak two hundred words per minute … but, physically, now you can say only twenty words per minute … so when you'll try to speak fast, it would get stuck, the reason why we stammer! Rate Reduction Therapy… While you're speaking, if there is a need to talk faster, then don't talk… Take …your… time… and… say… the… words… slowly… in.. a rhythm… Take this list. You have to buy everything that is written on it… Go Arjun… All the best. Yes? Maggi? Maggi?...Are you sure? Give me the list Tea Leaves. What?...Tea Leaves? Slowly... Fortune... Mustard... Oil... Mustard Oil? Fortune Mustard Oil? O – unknown island someone is calling... A – the lighted candle in the postbox E– Such a day when the picnic starts OI – The plane in the sky shines in the sun Look at the sun that is setting Music plays in the field rampart. In the primer of this life Let the words be good friends today Words are flying, words are bonding Happiness like saving coins Words bloom softly, in whose lips Bloom the alphabets Had a small introduction The story has been enacted If it advances further Let it be. What flower is given as an expression of love? Rose. Dose? RJ is saying it right, why are you unnecessarily harassing him? Did you notice that his voice is much clearer now? Are you deaf? See! He can say a full sentence. K – College Street, in a drenched tram KH – Bits of hay … the rain comes G – The bye-lane and the vagabond GH – Song of the kite that flew away Look at the sun that is setting Music plays in the field concert. In the primer of this life Let the words be good friends today. If you could please update my passbook… This is not a machine but... a human speaking. Why did you take the trouble to come? Your wife could have come! Why? Do you like my wife more? Maa..what should I do on parent's day?... Last time Baba was with us… Should you and I do something? What should we do…? Tell what we should do... Goopi Bagha... Goopi Bagha… You both are really good kids… Come to me, come to me!... We'll enact Goopi Bagha? I'll be the King of the ghosts! I'll be Goopi! Goopi Bagha... Goopi Bagha… You both are really good kids… Come to me, come to me!... Do you know us? You know our names? I know your names, address…everything! The king drove you away… Oh the way you helped him! Where you'll go, what you'll do you don't know! Seriously Rajamoshai, we are really sad! We don't know what to do! I'm there, I'm there, I'm the King of Ghosts... If I'm happy, I'll fulfill your wishes. Three wishes, Three wishes, Three wishes! Three wishes! We should never have to worry about food and clothes… Alright! … If you want food then you should clap… If you want clothes then you should clap… One of you should clap the other's hand What other wishes do you desire? We really love to travel dear King! Wear the shoes, name the place that you want to visit and then clap each other's hands. Also, dear King, if we could entertain everyone with our songs and music.. Sure! It would be so. There will be songs and drums, music and rhythm, Whoever will listen will be stunned and will be still! Excellent! Great! A laryngectomy patient... will be a radio jockey… will be a radio jockey! We will do a show which will be named… Name? Yes..Tell me… I need a show name… Ju..Juju? Juju! Juju who scares you and Juju who is the friend.. There is a website named 'Web Whisper' by laryngectomy patients… Really? Yes…exactly! There are many laryngectomy patients who sing, do rap, do robot rap… We should definitely let them know this. This sounds very good… very good! Yes… Absolutely! You all, often, don't understand what I am saying... and I'm going to do a professional radio show? Radio is very personal… I don't want to be a laughing stock Manoj. Romila, I can't do a show…sorry! Arjun! Romila please see… Arjun! I'll see, don't worry! Arjun… Come with me. Ticket... ticket How are you? All well? Yes, very well. It has been 5 years… Ganeshda has never stopped.. He has kept on doing his work... Here..take this. Vascular system is something which keeps a man alive… Come inside… Hello…How are you? Should we come in? Going on fine? So, let me finish with the class… I hope you are well! Yes sir.. Dr. Romen Samaddar… It has been three years Arjun! He is continuing his own profession… he didn't stop! He teaches Cardiology. Arjun… You are not doing this show for yourself… You'll do this for Somnathda… You'll do it for all the cancer patients. A hawker, a professor, a bus conductor… The Creator has taken away so many of their voices… But they all returned to their professions, due to will power and you are saying you won't be able to do it? The world doesn't get to know about these people… But you can share their stories with the world… Don't give up Arjun… don't give up You are their hope… You are their voice... You can't fail the human race. At least let one person talk against this disease For now we have got a weekend show and management has approved… The show has been confirmed… Absolutely! On Sunday morning, from 11.00 to 1.00 … The name of the show is 'Juju' And we'll also going live on facebook…yes! The whole world will know that a laryngectomy patient is conducting a show… You must do it… Arjun…Arjun… Me? Happy Anniversary! I don't get the odour of your body anymore. Are you angry with me? Today is a very special day! Manoj informed... That the show has been confirmed. Romila took me to a lot of places today… I met so many people… I, really, missed you today… You spent the whole day with Romila? I have collected a lot of journals for Arjun and there are many case histories… And see this pen drive contains a lot of videos of patients. If only the sound of breathing could be slightly reduced from the stroma… otherwise the voice is absolutely clear…what do you say? I'm super excited Pritha… I'm super excited! I feel like I am… …not Arjun… I'm conducting the show. I don't want your presence on the show that day… I don't want... ...you to be there on Arjun's show… He can do everything now… he can even speak… I want him to do everything on his own… The way you're feeling today that you are conducting the show instead of Arjun… I have felt the same way for the last 22 years. In Caledonia of Scottish College our first audio play … He rehearsed in front of me that whole night… And when the next day he was participating in the competition, I felt I was standing there... right beside him! 'Biday Abhishap' in Jadavpur Gandhi Bhaban, I was there beside him… Our first reading of Purnendu Patri's 'Prothom Kathopokathan' in All India Radio… From then on, 'Kathopokathan' became our life… Arjun and Pritha's pair… we were going everywhere together… I want my Arjun back… Romila… I want him back… I'm aware how much you've contributed in Arjun's life… But… I can never let go of that day… …Please! I envy Arjun's dependence on you… What's your relationship with him? The relationship between a speech pathologist and a patient … That's all? That's all. Then keep this… This is your fees… And thank you! Pritha, you didn't want to know even for once... why I'm giving the journals to you?... Why did I give the case histories to you only?... Why did I give those videos to only you?... Because... My journey has also come to an end, Pritha...! I have to return to Dhaka. The most important life support to a laryngectomy patient... ...is his wife! So many people leave their near and dear ones at such junctures of life. I have seen, so many cancer patients being abandoned by their relatives. Pritha, I'm absolutely charmed by you. It was good that you said it. Even if you hadn't told me, I would not have stayed for the show... Arjun is yours, Pritha… …all yours… I won't be able to accept the fees… neither from you nor Arjun… The love that I have received before leaving India for Dhaka… that is my biggest reward… I hope our friendship lasts… What happened Mom? Come, we'll have to return… All the patients in Dhaka are waiting … Take me back, I have been here for a long time... I have heard that many unsaid words float in the sky there... Covered by an all-encompassing light! Further away... Making conscience my company Arjun I'm sorry…I have to return to Dhaka for some important reasons… You have to conduct the show alone… Best of luck! The golden rays of the sun has woven a collage there Covered by an all-encompassing light! Sun has its home in my heart... My eyes reflect my lust for life... My mind nests Himalayan hope Never asked for a receipt for buying time My God will recognize me I'm standing at His door... Dreaming the same dream everyday 'Art defeats cancer'! Mom … Mom … Hmm? Arjun uncle is calling... It's okay… we shouldn't pick up. Don't pick up… He has a show today… he needs to concentrate. Leave it… Please give back the keys… Welcome friends! You're with Juju … In the world of Juju... This morning, Juju will talk with his friends … Let's see which friend is on the line … Madam, previously he used to do shows in the night … And then after he had cancer, his voice had to be operated … But he has come back … Hello Juju! How're you? I'm good … How're you? I'm fine … Who is talking? I'm Rob … Hello Rob! How're you? Who all are there in your home? My mom is there, my dad is there and my little sister … Puchki! Oh... Puchki? Who is more naughty – you or Puchki? I'm more naughty … Silently, I eat my sister's tiffin … Oneday, I cut off her doll's hair. Show... how many? Show is a hit! Superb! Superb! Oh my God! What a sultry morning! Let me see which friend is on the line. Hello Juju! I'm Tiasha speaking … Tiasha Pal … I live in New Alipur … Where are you Juju? Juju, where have you gone? What happened? Juju … Have you returned to Mars? I want to talk to you … Juju … Will you please raise the volume? Hey Juju! Why aren't you talking to me? Battery exhausted! Wait! Shall I come? Please stop the car for a while. Juju, I want to be your friend … Juju, do not go back to Mars … Manoj go and check! Feeling very tensed … Esophageal... Arjun try your esophageal voice... Mom! Juju is not talking … He cannot hear! Backup sound should start … No no... Don't go anywhere! I want to talk to Juju, but he's not talking at all! Hello!... I'm Muju speaking! Muju? Yes! I'm Muju … Let's go! I'm... Juju's brother Muju speaking … Juju has gone to have ice cream … He's naughty! Ice cream is not available in our Mars … So he has gone to have ice cream … He said it in esophageal voice … isn't it Mom? I love vanilla more than anything else … I also … Tell me … can Juju have ice cream? Yes! He can! He loves to have ice cream. Do you know on my last birthday I fed everyone with ice cream? Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce … Did you ever have it Muju? It's my hot favourite! I love to have it! Please have it once! Will you come to my house one day? Hello … Then I'll feed you with the Vanilla Ice Cream with chocolate sauce … Also bring Juju with you … Is it working? Fantastic … It's working Manoj! Hello Muju! Where have you gone? Juju has returned … Hello Muju! How dare you? How dare you keep me away from my friends? Mom! Juju has come back! Why are you so envious? Juju … now our Madam will come to teach us … Our Madam will, also, come to teach me and Muju … You also have a Madam? Yes! But now she has taken leave … That's why I found time to come and talk with you! Do you know, our Madam is... very sweet … and... very... strict at the same time … How so? Our Madam says... In order to talk, you don't need to apply any tactics … Day and night only practice and practice! For our beautiful Madam, here's a beautiful song ̶ Friends … you also continue to listen … In Mars, we also listen to this song … On your birthday, amidst so many secret envelopes I'll also sing a song … Among your flower pots, I'll also bathe In the different shades of sunlight! Melodies rise from the piano Sunrays come running in the noon Emotions raise their heads To throw me on the sea shore Knowing it well there's no hope I start getting thinner like the shadows! On your birthday, amidst so many secret envelopes I'll also sing a song … People floating in the air Give you bunches of flowers None of them will try to find out That I roam with so many letters Knowing it well there's no hope I start fading out in the evening of winter! On your birthday, amidst so many secret envelopes I'll also sing a song … Hello Juju brother! Please don't be angry with me! Now I'm far away! I didn't get to say goodbye… That's why I'm writing to you now! You have to help me with a lot of work… After the death of Somnathda, the Laryngectomy club is on the verge of getting closed … You have to continue it… You are listening to Juju… And you have to continue your show as well… You are an inspiration to a lot of people… I have joined a hospital in Dhaka… Saheli has also started going to a new school… We are very happy here… Juju brother…we'll definitely meet… someday or the other! I'm giving you my word… 'Ei Somoy – Aloye Phera' powered by S News.. Show of the Year goes to… Any guesses? Juju... I would like to call RJ Arjun Mullick on stage Go Guru… Go for it!

My... ...teacher... my guide… Romila Choudhury. She is in Dhaka now… My friends at the radio station who never let me slacken… Manoj… Thank you! Indrani... She never let me feel alone! And my son Tukai who loves my robot voice the most! Tukai … Dad mentioned your name! And that person, Who endured everything… My helplessness… my anger…my depression… People say that... the most important life support for a cancer patient is his wife… Pritha… ...love you… And I want to thank my audience who, regularly, listen to my show… For loving my... ...mechanical voice! I would like to call on stage my friends from the Laryngectomy Club… My fight… Our fight… is against Him… to whom, I wish to say, from this stage… I'm made of clay, I'm the embodiment of the Soul. I'm imperishable, inexhaustible, immortal. I intimidate the humans, demons and gods. I'm ever-unconquerable. I'm the God of gods, the supreme humanity. I'm traversing the heaven and earth! I'm mad, I'm mad! I have realized myself, all the barriers have crumbled away!! I'm the Rebel Brighu, I'll stamp my footprint on God's chest...
