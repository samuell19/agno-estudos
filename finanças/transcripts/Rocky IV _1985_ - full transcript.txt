Man, get up. Get up! That's not the way to do it. Apollo? Right. What are you doin' here? Business. If the papers knew we were talkin' like this, they'd think we was crazy. Why you? 'Cause I'm the best, and you need somebody to teach you different. I don't need this no more. I... I don't want this no more. Look, man. When you beat me, I hurt all over. I didn't wanna know from nothin' or nobody, not even my kids. Hell, every fighter knows that hurt, and we get sick inside trying to live with it, so don't back off now. Make it right for yourself or you'll be sorry you didn't. Now, when we fought, you had the eye of the tiger, man. The edge! And now you gotta get back, and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning. You know what I mean? Maybe we can win it back together. Eye of the tiger, man. Rocky! Rocky! Get it back, man. Rocky! Rocky! Come on! Come on, Balboa. Come on! Come on, get those feet moving. Get your hands up. Come on, Rock! Ooh! That right hand hurt Rocky again! A right! Another right! A right! Another right! And down goes Balboa again. Four. Stop the fight. -You better stay down. -Six. I got some more. I got some more for you, so get up. I got a lot of moves. I got a lot of moves. Come on. Here we go again. Clubber coming into him. You ain't so bad. You ain't so bad. You ain't so bad. Come on. You ain't so bad. You ain't nothin'! -You must be crazy or something! -I'm crazy? -You're just a stupid fool! -Yeah, I may be... -You're crazy. -...but I ain't breathing heavy. He's a fool. He's stupid. How could he come back from a beating like that? Hey, what the hell are you doing? What the hell are you doing? I know what I'm doing. No, you don't know what you're doing! He's gotta come to you. You're the champ. He's nothing. He's mine. -Don't... -He's getting tired. Don't go wasting your punches. I know what I'm doing, I swear. I know what I'm doing. Go out there and do it, Rock. Eye of the tiger. You understand? Yeah. Go out there and knock his head off. He's just a man, Rock. He's just a man. All right? Be more man than him! Go get him. Eye of the tiger! Eye of the tiger! All right, this is the beginning of round three. Tough rounds to call right now. -Come on. Come on. -Come on. And Rocky throws him three rights to the head and a left. He is back. He's your heavyweight. Stick him! Get in there! Come on! Come on! He's getting killed. Oh, no, no, no. He's not getting killed, he's getting mad! My mother hits harder than that. Come on. A little harder. A little harder, champ. In the face. Come on. Again, come on, champ. You ain't so bad! You ain't nothing. Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! -You see how he drew him in? -Right. Now Rocky's throwing the punches. Look at the punches. Yeah! Rocky! Rocky! Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on. Rocky! Rocky! Come on. Come on! Yeah! You're out! Yeah! There he is, the new heavyweight champion of the world, Rocky Balboa! Rocky is exhausted! We did it! Ladies and gentlemen, the winner by knockout... Are you all right? Never better. Never better. Once again the heavyweight champion of the world, the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa. Today may have proved to be a landmark in sports history. -After unraveling years of red tape... -Come on! ...Russia will now throw its hat into the ring. The prize ring, that is. The introductions were made by his wife, Ludmilla Vobet Drago She was the double gold medalist in swimming. Today, the Soviet Union has officially entered professional boxing. My husband and great undefeated heavyweight world amateur champion, Captain Ivan Drago, has come here with his trainers to America to compete as an international sportsman and ambassador of goodwill. If possible, we would like to have an exhibition bout with your great champion Rocky Balboa as a way to introduce Drago to America. Has Balboa responded? No, he has not responded. Drago is still an amateur. What makes you think he can stand up the pressure of fighting someone as seasoned and strong as Balboa? Drago is the most perfectly trained athlete in the world. There is no one who can match his strength, his endurance, or his aggressiveness. You make it sound like he's indestructible. Yes, he is. Well, can this mammoth Russian, who's already been nicknamed the Siberian Express, wreak havoc among the professional heavyweight ranks? Whoever he fights first, it'll be one hot ticket. We'll be right back with a check on today's pro football sports scoreboard. You know, those Russians are real serious about their giant taking your title. You know that? I've heard some talk. It's a lot more than talk, Stallion. A lot more than talk. They get to you? Well, they were talking to the boxing commission about me and this guy putting on this exhibition, you know. Yeah. What'd you say? I say, I don't know. Say, what'd you say? -Say? -Yeah, what'd you say? I said, "I don't know." What you're saying is you really don't wanna fight this Russian. -That's what you're saying, right? -No, no, no. No. What I'm saying is, why do it, you know, until I have to? Well, you don't mind me beating up on him a little bit now, do you? You what? Yeah. What? You think I don't have it anymore? You got nothing more to prove, do you? Look, man, this is the opportunity of a lifetime. This isn't just another boxing climb into the ropes. This is a Russian propaganda machine starting up. And they didn't miss a thing. I mean, look, they had to try to win the women over by having this Russian's wife running around and telling everybody what a great guy this Drago is. Look, this is politics all the way, Stallion. Politics. This is a chance to stand face-to-face with their best. I mean, it'd be more important to the people than ever. It'd be in the history books. Right. You know, listen, Adrian just cooked some dinner. Why don't we go up? We'll eat, we'll talk about it. She'd love to see you, Apollo, really. All right, yeah, you know... Never turn down a great Italian meal, right? -All right. -Hut one, hut two. My husband and I thank you for coming to our training quarter today. As you can see, it is highly advanced, and we wish to show the American press a small portion of the advances our country's made in the technology of human performance. What does all this do to enhance performance? It makes a man a better man, a great athlete, a super athlete, by harnessing all of his strength. Though most of the world is ignorant in body chemistry, we wish to educate your country. Shall we have a demonstration? -Please do. -Thank you. As you can see, Drago averages 1,850 pounds, so the result's quite obvious. Whatever he hits, he destroys. I've seen this Drago fight when he was an amateur. He's big and he's strong, but he's clumsy. I know I can beat him. -You can do your homework. -Okay. Later, Dad. Later, Uncle Paulie. Later, Apollo. -Later, big guy. -See you later, kiddo. Don't you think people are expecting to see Rocky whack this bum out first? Yeah, and he will, when it's for real. This is just an exhibition bout. It's kids' stuff. What's the purpose? I mean, what at this point in your life is worth getting hurt for? I don't want this chump to come over here with all that hype, you know, trying to make us look bad. They try every other way. I think it's wrong. No, it's never been more right. It's not the middle ages when armies sent over their best fighters to kill each other. We're supposed to be civilized. You're a great fighter, but you've been retired for nearly five years. Don't you think it's time to start thinking about something else? I mean, how much can you take? Either of you. I'll get the coffee. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... I just care about you both. I... Just relax. I'll be right back. You're not mad, are you? No, I'm not mad. Just have a bad feeling. You know Apollo. He's got this big imagination, you know. With Apollo, he needs to be loved. He just can't stand being forgotten. I guess he's gonna have to face up to it. So do you. Yeah, I know. All this won't happen if you don't back it. Apollo, he thinks he's fighting for the whole country but his reasons are wrong. It's... It's like a bad publicity stunt. I don't want you getting upset. You're not upset, are you? -I'm not upset. -You sure? You're okay? -You sure? -Sure. Wanna go a few rounds at the bag? -Okay. -Whoa! Champ! -Thank you. -No problem. Now, this was a great fight. Yeah, this was great. Mamma mia! What you using for a chin there, Stallion? I should have slipped that one. Yeah, you definitely should have slipped that one. Ain't it something, Stallion? It's crazy how people, they just care about you when you're in that ring and they care about you when you're bleeding, but once you step out of that ring, Stallion, it's like you're ancient history. Can I ask you something? What? Well, you know, this fight you're having against the Russian... Do you think maybe it ain't against him? Well, do you think maybe it's, like, you against you? What do you think? I don't think I want to hear this, Stallion. Come on. Hey, Apollo, look, you were a great fighter, no doubt about that, but, look, we gotta face the facts, too. You don't want to believe it, but maybe the show is over. Man, that's easy for you to say. You're still on top. Let's face it, we gotta change sometime. I don't want to change, man. I like who I am. But look at that, you know? You don't want to believe this, but that ain't us up there no more, Apollo. We can't do that the way we did it before. We're changing. Maybe you think you're changing, but you can't change what you really are. And you can forget all this money and stuff you got all around you, man, 'cause it don't change a thing. You and me, we don't even have a choice. See, we're born with a killer instinct that you can't just turn off and on like some radio. We have to be right in the middle of the action 'cause we're the warriors. And without some challenge, without some damn war to fight, then the warrior may as well be dead, Stallion. All right? So... So I'm asking you, as a friend, stand in my corner just this one last time. Apollo, what made you decide to put on an exhibition fight with Drago? Let's call it a sense of responsibility. Responsibility how? I had to teach this young fellow to box, American style. Apollo, isn't Drago a little inexperienced to be in the same ring? Well, you know, some folks got to learn the hard way. So, no quick knockout prediction? No, no, no. I'm not mad at him. I just want to show the whole world that Russia doesn't have all the best athletes. Rocky, aren't you helping to train Apollo? Well, yeah, I'm gonna try if he'll listen. Wait a minute. What do you mean "listen," Stallion? It is hard to get a word in-- -Oh, come on. -It's hard. Come on, man. My man. -Rocky. -Yeah. How do you think Apollo should fight Drago? How? Well, personally, I think you're gonna need a very big ladder. Drago, how does it feel to spar with the great former champion? The man's tongue didn't come through customs. You don't really think you gonna whip me, do you, huh? I did not come here to lose. So no quick knockout prediction. Excuse, please. You are not very realistic, are you, Mr. Creed? Where did you come from? What are you talking about? You can box, yes, but you are far too old to think that you can win over Drago. Is that a fact? And it could be a painful one. You put that heavy bag with eyeballs in the ring with me, and you're gonna see the meaning of pain. Why do you insult us? Don't make me out to be the bad guy. I came here to talk about a friendly exhibition bout till Comrade Big Mouth started up. It is you who are the aggressor. This is obvious. I wish to say to the press, in all fairness, Drago should not even fight this man, because the truth is, he is a has-been. To defeat him is an accomplishment not worthy of Drago. But to fight the real champion, this means something. You get that big chump in the ring right now, and I'm gonna show you what I have. Bring it on! I don't want to hear her. Just let that chump go. All right, all right, all right. All right, I said what I feel. We're gonna finish this in the ring. You understand? We're gonna finish this in the ring. Look, you just shut up. We're gonna finish this in the ring. You understand me? I'm talking to you. And you too, and all these puppets you got with you. Wherever you like. -How did I do? -Little loud for my taste. -Wait, wait. But good? -Oh, yeah, very good. The city of lights, Las Vegas and to one of the most unusual events in years, East meets West, age versus youth in a goodwill exhibition match, as the former champion Apollo Creed takes on a mountain of muscle from the Soviet Union, Ivan Drago. Apollo! Apollo! Apollo! Ivan! I feel good! Good evening, everyone. Along with Warner Wolf, I'm Stu Nahan, and we welcome you to a most unusual event. For the first time ever, West against East in professional sports. God, I feel born again. Tonight's special event features two great athletes. In the blue corner, weighing 221 pounds, a former heavyweight champion of the world, the Dancing Destroyer, the King of Sting, the Count of Monte Fisto... You think you got enough names? Patience, Stallion. Almost done. ...the one and only Apollo Creed! The crowd anticipating a great fight now as Apollo is in the ring. He's playing to the crowd. Apollo! In the red corner, weighing an even 261 pounds, gold medalist and undefeated world amateur champion from the Soviet Union, the Siberian Bull, Ivan Drago. I want you! I want you! I want you! I want you! I want you, Drago! Now the two fighters come to the center of the ring for the instructions from referee Lou Filippo. You boys know the rules. Watch your low blows, kidney punches, rabbit punches. In case of a knockdown, you go to the corner I tell you to and you stay there until I tell you to come out. Shake hands. Let's have a good fight. Come on, get your hands up, man! You need an interpreter? You will lose. Why don't you land him on his head? All right. The bad blood between these two can be felt all over this arena. I can't get over the size of this Russian. Apollo! Apollo! Apollo! Get ready, 'cause it's show time! It's show time! It's show time! Come on. And Apollo seems to be in great spirits tonight. He's really putting on a show for this capacity crowd. Be back in a minute, all right? Round one. Creed dancing around. Creed backpedaling now. He's been away five years... Don't wait on him. Get on first. Come on! He may be big enough, but you are mean! Come on. Come on, chump. Come on. Neither fighter ready to throw a punch. A left jab there. A left jab once again by Creed. A slip by Creed. This is bizarre. Creed is over the hill, and the Russian hasn't fought anybody. Keep it going! Keep it going! All right, Apollo! Keep moving! Keep it going! Keep it going! Keep him bottled! Keep your chin down! Keep moving, Apollo! Stick him! Drago moving in again. A left hand by Creed, another left hand by Creed, and Drago moves away. All right, come on! You're the best, Apollo. You're the best. Come on. Get your hands up. Another left hand by Creed. Drago waiting, waiting, cocking that right hand. Attack him! A crushing right by the Russian! Get out of there! Stay away from him! Get out of there! He's taking some punishment now! Drago moves him against the ropes. Tie him up now! Left hand ties him up. And now the Russian throws Creed across the ring. Move! The Russian's got Creed stuck now. Tie him up! One, two, three... -Get up, man. Come on! -...four, five, six. Clinch! Clinch! All right! Clinch! It is Drago with the upper hand now, Drago with the left to the midsection. Get out of that corner! Another right hand thrown by Drago. -Can Creed stay up? -Apollo! Creed... Creed is against the ropes. What's the matter with you guys? What are you guys doing? This is supposed to be an exhibition! You understand? An exhibition! A tremendous end to the first round by the Russian, and a very bloody Apollo Creed. The Soviet's strength is incredible! Champ, look, I gotta stop it. Don't you dare stop this fight. Man, don't do this to me. I'm doing this for me. I'm here to fight. Don't you stop this fight. Boy, I'll tell you something, that was a pulverizing round for the ex-champion. Hey, folks, Ivan Drago is definitely for real. Apollo! Apollo! If you're my friend, don't you stop this fight. -Apollo! Apollo! -No matter what. Apollo! Apollo! Apollo! Apollo! Creed now comes out for round two. The Russian's trying to intimidate Creed. Come on, pull it together! And the Russian throws a right hand and staggers Creed! Another right to the jaw! Another right to the head! Time up now! Time up! Stop the fight! The referee tries to step in, and he's thrown across the ring. Throw the towel! Throw the towel! Apollo! Apollo! Apollo! Creed is down! Apollo is down, and he could be badly hurt. Let him breathe! -Move back! -Get these guys out of here. The winner, Ivan Drago. Let me through! Apollo! I cannot be defeated. Somebody get a doctor in here! Soon, I defeat real champion. -Stand back. -Will you let him breathe? Come on, Apollo. Soon, whole world will know my name. Drago. Drago. What started out as a joke has turned out to be a disaster. If he dies, he dies. Men are made for the end in the beginning. Apollo Creed was a warrior. He lived and he died by the code of a warrior. A warrior has the right to choose his way of life and his way of death. And we are bound to respect this sacred right. In this life we live, there's always the possibility of holy intrusion. And so it was that Apollo came to know that none of his successors had come close to satisfying the questions he had inside. He gave his life to know those answers. I owe everything I got and my family has got to you. You gave me a break when no one else would. You believed in me when no one else would. I really loved you, man. I let it happen. No, you didn't. It's no one's fault. You can't put all that blame on yourself. He was your friend. You would have done anything to protect him. You have to believe that. We've gone over these facts many times, Mr. Balboa. The answer is still the same. Can't you change the rules? Under present federation rules, any fight between you and this Russian cannot, nor will it be allowed. Let's be realistic. The Russian, he has not yet had one legitimate professional fight. The bout he had with Creed was a publicity stunt that backfired! What you guys are really saying is you don't think I have a chance, do you? Come on. What we're trying to say is, why tempt fate? Let's find out more about this man. Let's see what develops. He's had one professional fight, and one man is dead. But if it prevents another fatality, -it's well worth it. -Of course. Best way to a boxing ban is one more accident. Especially at this magnitude. Do you realize what kind of a magnitude this is? Excuse me. Do you wanna know what the bottom line is? You got rules. We've got rules. Everybody's got to abide by those rules. -Rocky, is the decision final? -Yes. Rocky, over here, please. Is this the first time the champion has given up his crown? I don't know about that. Doesn't the title mean anything to you anymore? Not until this is over. Look, we know you've agreed to fight, but don't you think you're moving a little too quickly? Drago's ready now. Drago, what does this fight mean to you? Do you have any feelings on it? No. Drago has told me that this will be an easy fight. Can't Drago speak for himself? Yes. Yes, well? It's a matter of science and evolution. Isn't it, gentlemen? Drago is 13 years younger, and the most perfectly trained fighter ever. This other man has not the size, or the endurance, or the genetics to win. It's physically impossible for this little man to win. Drago is a look at the future. Has the fight date been set yet? December 25th. -Why Christmas? That's what I was told. Where? -It's in Russia. -Are you nuts? Why did you agree to this? We fight in Soviet Union, or we fight nowhere. This country could never judge a fight fair. What makes you say he's not being treated fairly? It is more lies and false propaganda to support this antagonistic and violent government! Oh! Violent? Hey, we don't keep our people behind a wall with machine guns! -Who are you? -Who am I? I'm the unsilent majority, big mouth! Good! Yes, good! Insult us! Is more typical rude behavior toward visiting foreigners. But perhaps this simple defeat of this little so-called champion will be a perfect example of how pathetically weak your society has become! We go! Rocky, over here. Rocky, can you tell us about a... Mrs. Balboa! Mrs. Balboa! How do you feel about going to Russia? Is your husband going to Moscow? -Mrs. Balboa! -Adrian! Adrian! Mrs. Balboa, did Creed's death make up your husband's mind? I don't know what you're talking about! When will you be going to Russia? Look, I'm not going to Russia. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know why you're here. I don't know what you people are doing here! -Mrs. Balboa! Was it his decision? -Rocky? -Yeah? You all right? Yeah. Fine. Why'd you do it? I just gotta do what I gotta do. You don't have to do anything. No, Adrian, I do, and... I gotta leave this place, too. So where are you going? They said they're going to let me train in Russia, and... I just want to go someplace where I ain't gonna think about nothing except him. Rocky, give it some time. Don't do this. A lot of people live with hurt. Adrian, a lot of people don't have a choice. I do. And for that, you're willing to lose everything? There's a lot more than this, Adrian. Before, there were reasons to fight I could understand, but I don't understand this. Even if you win, Apollo's still gone. Why can't you change your thinking? Everybody else does! 'Cause I'm a fighter. Do you know what everybody says? That it's suicide! You've seen him. You know how strong he is. You can't win! Adrian. Adrian. Adrian always tells the truth. No, maybe I can't. I don't know. Are you scared? No. Yes, you are. A little, maybe? Well, to tell you the truth, sometimes, I get a little scared, you know. When I'm in that ring and I'm getting hit on, and my arms hurt so much I can't even lift 'em up anymore, and I'm hoping that the other guy hits me right on the chin so I don't feel nothing anymore, there's this other side that isn't so scared, you know. There's this side that, like, wants to take more, that, like, wants to go one more round. 'Cause, you know, like, going that one more round that's what makes the difference in your life. You know, there's gonna be a time when you're gonna have to do things that other people don't think are right, but you know they're gonna be right for you. And I don't care if everybody thinks they're wrong. You gotta do what you gotta do. You understand? You gotta do it for you. It's like, the most important thing I could tell you. This is what it's all about. You gotta live for yourself, 'cause you gotta live with yourself. You know what I mean? Rocky. Come on! The meter's running! I guess this is it. I can't make you stay? You know, I... I gotta go. I gotta go. Rocky, please. I want you to stay. Please don't go. Adrian, listen to me. Remember, a long time ago, I once said to you I never asked you to stop being a woman? Don't ask me to stop being a man. You'll be all right. You'll be all right. What a horrendous flight. This is Russia? They don't look so tough, Rocky. Hey, Paulie. What are you doing with Adrian's earmuffs? They look better on me. Mr. Balboa. We take you to quarters now. Get in the car. We have very long trip. Sounds like Dracula's cousin. Come on, Paulie. Like you request, yes? You requested this dumb location? Yeah. Why? You planning to grow reindeer or something? The equipment you requested is in barn. -Who are they? -They? They are assigned to you. Official chaperones, yes? Where you go, they go. When do the sparring partners get here? We provide no sparring partners. We're supposed to have them. This, I do not know. You have everything I have been instructed to provide. We are finished, yes? No sparring? I don't think I need it anymore, Paulie. No sparring, no TV, nothing? How the heck is he supposed to train around here? It's a good place to die. Checkmate, friend. Maybe I can't win. Maybe the only thing I can do is just take everything he's got. But to beat me, he's gonna have to kill me. And to kill me, you're gonna have to have the heart to stand in front of me. And to do that, he's gotta be willing to die himself. I don't know if he's ready to do that. I don't know. -Yeah? -Hey, champ, can I come up? Yeah, sure. -How you doing? -Pretty good. Some kind of weather we're having up here, huh? Yeah, it's pretty rough. But for what you gotta do, it's good. -Toughen you up. -I guess so. I know you're gonna have to do almost everything alone up here, but you know I'll be with you. Yeah, I know. Apollo was like my son. I raised him. And when he died, part of me died. But now you're the one. You're the one that's gonna keep his spirit alive. You're the one that's gonna make sure that he didn't die for nothing. Now, you're gonna have to go through hell, worse than any nightmare that you ever dreamed. But in the end, I know you'll be the one standing. I'll try. I'll try. You know what to do. Do it. I couldn't stay away anymore. I missed you. I missed you. I'm with you, no matter what. No pain. No pain. No pain. Go on, pick it up. Pick it up, come on. Come on, push! -Come on! Come on! Push it up! Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago! Hello, everybody, and Merry Christmas from a very unusual place. We're in Moscow, in the Soviet Union. I'm Barry Tompkins, along with Al Bandiero, and this promises to be the most-watched event in boxing history. The Iron Horse, from America, Rocky Balboa. Ivan Drago, since that tragedy in Las Vegas and the death of Apollo Creed, he's been re-nicknamed "Death from Above." And high above us, the general secretary of the Soviet and other members of the Politburo have now made their way to their seats high above the ring here in Moscow. You don't know anything about this guy you're fighting. It's just some kind of exhibition fight. This ain't gonna mean nothing. You may not understand what I'm talking about now. I can appreciate that. But you will when it's over. Believe me. You will when it's over. Yo, Rock, I know you're kinda busy just now, but I want to tell you some things I never told you. I know sometimes I act stupid and I say stupid things, but you kept me around when other people would have said, "Drop that bum." You give me respect. You know, it's hard for me to say these kind of things, because that ain't my way, but if I could just unzip myself and step out and be someone else, I'd want to be you. You're all heart, Rock. Thanks, Paulie. Now, blast this guy's teeth out. I'll try. Right now, one of the fighters is starting to make his way through this crowd and toward the ring. Listen to this crowd! We knew he wouldn't be popular, but this borders on pure hatred. Rocky's face, absolutely like stone. He is the picture of concentration, and the booing crowd here does not seem to bother him one bit. The champ has a look tonight that can burn through lead. What Rocky Balboa really brings to this dance is a lot of heart and a lot of determination, but then he gives away strength and gives away size, and maybe even more important, he gives away age. It seems that the booing crowd has absolutely no effect on the man. His concentration seems to be like stone. Listen to this crowd. It sounds insane. The power of Ivan Drago is virtually a biochemical product. The man is infinitely stronger than Rocky Balboa, and a foot taller. Every punch is a lethal weapon. And now the entrance of the Russian national champion, Ivan Drago, a man with an entire country in his corner. Look at the expression on the face of Ivan Drago. He seems impervious to this madness of the crowd. He's like a volcano just waiting to erupt. The Russian champion is amazingly cool, ladies and gentlemen, as he acknowledges his premier. Ladies and gentlemen... ...Rocky Balboa! It's unbelievable. I have never, in all my years, seen such a hostile crowd. ...Ivan Drago! The two men are walking toward the center of the ring. It's an unbelievable sight to see. They're toe to toe. The Russian towers above the American. It's a true case of David and Goliath here. It's unbelievable, the condition of both men, but the Russian champion... I must break you. Remember what I said back there about wanting to be you? Yeah. Forget it. -Drago! Drago! -Drago! Drago! Take it straight to him, now. There's the bell for the opening round, and Rocky Balboa comes out to the center of the ring. But the Russian, right back into Balboa's corner now. Come on, baby! Spit him out, Rock! Balboa gets out of the corner now, and now once more it is Drago backing Rocky Balboa up with a jab, and Balboa is not staying on balance because of the long jab of the Russian. Keep working, Rock. Brace yourself! Brace yourself! Get up! Hands up! Charge him! Charge him! He can't seem to touch the Russian. Cut him down! Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble. They might have to stop this one before somebody gets killed. Reach and grab him! Reach and grab him! Rocky's hurt. A right hand from Drago sends Rocky Balboa 15 feet across the ring! And the champ is down! Back up! Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago! Breathe. Don't be scared. I can do it. Get up! Get up! Drago! Come on, Rock! Drago continuing to punish Rocky Balboa. He just will not let him out of that corner, and Rocky Balboa is just trying to get through this first round. The Russian just threw Rocky Balboa into his own corner like a rag doll. Drago! Drago! Drago! Way to go, Rock. Come on. You're fine. You're fine. It's been a tough first three minutes for Rocky Balboa. He's not only fighting what appears to be an invincible opponent, he's also fighting a very hostile crowd and the Russian premier and most of the Politburo looking on. All right, what's happening out there? He's winning. I see three of him out there. Hit the one in the middle. -Right! -Keep taking it till it's got him. Okay? That's gonna hurt him. -No pain. -No pain. No pain. Keep taking it to him. Keep walking to him. Keep walking to him. Walk right in the middle. -Take his heart. -Yes. Take his heart. Knock his brains out. Come on, we're waiting here. Keep going! There's the bell for round two. It's been a one-sided fight so far. It'll take more than luck for Rocky to survive this round. Rocky's been hit with bombs. Slip him a hook! Rocky Balboa trying to stay in the middle of the ring against the big Russian. Move down! That a baby! Do what you gotta do! Stay with him! Go for it! For all intents, Rocky Balboa should be all finished tonight, but he's fighting back ferociously. He's getting killed out there. Drago's best punches so far. He's cut and he's bleeding, but he's on his feet and he's on the run. Hold on! Hold on! Drago! Drago! He's cut! The Russian's cut, and it's a bad cut, and now it's Rocky Balboa coming after Ivan Drago! Give him more room! Yes! Yes! You got him! Yes! Go get him! Balboa picking up the Russian and throws him to the ground like a wrestler. It's a gutter war, no holds barred in Moscow. Rocky may be on the receiving end so far, but he's here to fight. This is shaping up to be a personal war, and right now, it's anybody's boxing match. You cut him! You hurt him! You see? You see? He's not a machine! He's a man! Hey, Rock. No fear. Hey, Rock. No fear. No pain. No pain. Beat him with your mind. You want it more than he does. No pain! Okay, take it to him! Take it to him! Take it to him! Get up! It's all right. And a good right hand by Rocky Balboa! Come on, come on! Rocky's got him now! You're doing fine. You're doing great. You've come a mighty long way, baby. -Crush him! -Now! -That's it! Keep going! -Go, go! Come on! A few cheers now for Rocky Balboa! Suddenly, Moscow is pro-Rocky! No pain. No pain. Keep taking it to him, you understand? Take his heart. No pain. I'll tell you, Al, this place is ready to explode. Lethal punch after punch! Amazing willpower! Neither man backing off, and Rocky Balboa's determination is actually beginning to win over what was once a hostile crowd. This is incredible! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! One more round. There's no stopping us now. This is our round. Don't stop it now! We start, and we don't stop! All your strength, all your power, all your love, everything you've got! Listen to 'em, Rock. They're calling your name. They're calling your name. Your boy hurt. We stop fight now. You'll stop nothin'. I didn't come here to end this fight sitting down. I watch closely. Yeah, you do that. Go talk to him. He's hurt too! There's the bell. The war is on. Your whole life, Rock. This is your whole life. Do it now! This is the last round. To the end. Yeah. Which one of these magnificent fighters will be standing at the end of this round? Drago snaps out a stiff jab, and another. Come on. Another! Rocky taking punishment, trying to get inside. He's completely exhausted. Get up, Rock! -Come on, Rock! -Fight! What are you waiting for? Fight! Hit him! Come on! Come on, fight! Rocky! Rocky! Come on, fight! Balboa is chopping the Russian down! Don't stop, Rock! ...combinations of punches on the Russian, and Drago throws a hard right hand, which stuns Rocky Balboa. Don't go down! You can forget technique, forget strategy, this is just a street fight. It's a question of who wants it most. -What is he doing? -He's winning. Chop him down! Come on! Rocko! Rocko, break his head! Rocko, knock his head off! Come on! Finish him! You're gonna do it! Don't stop! And these people love it! It is absolute pandemonium. More than ever, Rocky has proven himself a true champion! ...Rocky Balboa! When I came here tonight, I didn't know what to expect. I just saw a lot of people hating me. My best friend, he once said, "You can't change." He died. In here, there were two guys killing each other, but I guess that's better than 20 million. So, what I'm trying to say is that if I can change and you can change, everybody can change! Thank you.
