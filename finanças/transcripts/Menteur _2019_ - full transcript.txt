MOUNT GONGGA CHINA Our worst fears are coming true. The fabric of our reality is disintegrating. Our universe is in danger. Never in history have we seen such deceit. Lies. Manipulation. We´re reaching a breaking point. Freaky! What do we do? There´s a high concentration of lies in one area. That´s where the real danger is. We must help ‟He who lies like the wind.” And guide him toward his first truth. A´ight, cool. And where is this man? Easy! Washington. Moscow? Beijing? The Vatican? - Where is he, then? - Montreal. - Montreal? - Montreal. Yes, in Montreal. We must act quickly. Each lie delivers a blow, threatening the very fabric of our universe. You can hear the blows already. His lies are on the brink of crystallization. Let´s meditate to help ‟He who lies like the wind.” And guide him toward his first truth? The fate of the universe is in our hands. Yes. Aubert, Simon. Yes. I´m knee deep in water. Plumber´s on his way. My phone´s dying. Can´t talk. Trust me, I´m on it. Thank you. COMPULSIVE LIAR I´ll get back to you. I´m heading into a tunnel. The kidney-donation info session went long. I can´t Wednesday. I tutor immigrants. It´s my way of giving back. Start without me. Traffic´s bumper-to-bumper. Couldn´t finish it. Electrician was late. I can´t Tuesday. I sponge-bath seniors. I´m stuck at home. Cable guy´s still here. I swear. The elevator is still stuck. Your dog isn´t dead. He was abducted by aliens. It happens. I´m on it. Love the hair! ...two Ontarians in a car wash. Lasted 3 hours. Smelled like burnt rubber. I´m 100% vegan too. I´m on a raw-food diet too. Yes! It wasn´t my meat! A depressed friend´s staying with me. I told him: ‟Buy bacon again, you´re out.” We actually... put the fur back on the animal. My brother´s karma is shit. Don´t tell anyone. His wife is crazy about me. Jazz pulses through my veins. Jazz, it´s everything! But jazz is jazz! You can trust me. I´m on it. I... am... on it. Did I tell you I was on Degrassi? Season 2. Martine, love the hair! I need the Russian translator´s number. You said you knew one. AVIONECH HEADQUARTERS - MONTREAL Never said that. Yes, you did! You said you met a translator when your community theatre put on War and Peace. I´m VP of business affairs. It´s not my job. Want me to find a driver too? Hire a DJ for the office party? Yes. You said your cousin´s in Daft Punk. I´m sorry. I... I have a lot on my plate. You know France Gauthier drinks at meetings? No way! On a conference call with the Russians. No way! She yelled ‟shots!” Puked a little in her mouth. - No, I was there. - You were asleep. I´ve never slept during a meeting! Never yell at me again. You know I can´t handle yelling. Oh yeah, his ‟childhood”. Yes, my childhood, Robin! I´m just worried about France, OK? We have to be there for our boss. We´re lucky we found a translator. She was last on the list. Google Translate was next. My contact at the Russian embassy fell through. Maybe it´s the time difference? Love the hair! No you don´t. My hair is greasy. I didn´t have time to wash it. I haven´t washed it in 2 days. I´m overworked due to the Russian visit. I like your hair. Is that allowed? - Shut it. - It´s sleek. Shut it. I´d kill for hair like that. Stop talking. Get out. AVIONECH FACTORY SAINT-VALRAN Are you there? What´s going on? Yes, I´m here. It´s total chaos. The strikers are rioting. I´ll calm them down. They got such a good severance. I feel for them. A year without pay... Hey, Virginie´s here! Virginie? She´s married to my twin brother, Phil. She´s waving hello! Hi! This is no time for bullshit. The union needs to calm down. Don´t worry! I´m on it. Phil Aubert, Union President Phil, your brother´s here. Sandra, love the hair! - You said 10:00. - I know, but-- - Car´s in the shop? - No, I-- - Got a ticket? - No, my assistant... ...fell asleep. I calmed down the department heads. Just stick to the CEO´s memo. The Russian deal... ...is practically signed. - Keep it short. - You know me. Yeah, I know you. Still on for dinner? Of course! In my life, I-- Simon! Keep it short. Building A38 planes for Aeroskaya´s fleet is a large contract. We can´t lose it. When the Russian delegation visits the factory, it´s important that everything is in order. No demonstrations. Let´s show them that Avionech is a serious company, attractive even. The Russians... have a long working-class tradition. Let´s show them Avionech puts its workers first. It doesn´t just seek profit. It cares more about its workers than its shareholders. Simon Aubert, everybody! The Mozart of bullshit. Don´t write that down. Write down every damn word. This is important. I have 2 kids in school, a mortgage, a sick father, and I´m 45. If the factory closes... Our factory has made millions in the past 30 years. 30 years! They lay us off when it´s slow, and they´re gonna shut us down if this deal falls through? Don´t worry, Dominic. The Russian deal is ours. I´m on it. I hear you. Once again, I´m on it. St. Valran Gardens Retirement Home - Closed - Hi, Simon! - Hi, Paul! - How´s it going? - Good. How´s work? It´s crazy at the office. But we´ll get through it. Enjoy it! The days are long on unemployment. Like your parents. Ever since they closed the home-- Excuse me. Gotta take this. Sorry. Yes? So happy you´re here! Yes, finally! - How´s my boy? - Good! I-- - You sure? - We´re worried. - Overworked? - Stressed? - I´m OK! I-- - That´s what matters. I´m a wreck, but if you´re OK, I´m OK. Yes! Thanks, life! - How was the meeting? - Great! I-- If the factory closes, half the town loses their job. The other half´s already on welfare. Keeps me up at night! She kicks in her sleep and grinds her teeth. - Sure you´re OK? - Yes, I-- You´re not just saying that? - We worry. - You have a lot on your mind. - But everybody loves you. - A lot! - You saw your brother? - Yes, at-- If he loses his job... He´ll have to sell his house! Doesn´t help my jaw. OK, but-- - Like us. We cared for seniors. - Now we´re the seniors! Who would have guessed? - Well-- - That´s life! We might sell the building. So many unknowns! It´s not decided yet. I started the adoption process. - For a child? - Yes. I´m ready. That´s wonderful! You hear that, Claire? From where? Africa? Asia? I gotta go! Thanks so much. They need me at the office. This was fun. See you soon! Claire! We´re gonna be grandparents! No, Georges, we´re not! I know. He gets me every time. The Russian delegation arrives tomorrow. We´ll have a meeting with the minister of industry and the factory visit the following day with the Canadian prime minister. Oleg Medvedev, the head of the Russian delegation, is a very influential man. The 2016 Airbus deal fell through because of him. So, let´s be polite, professional... Sorry I´m late. The elevator´s still broken. Finally, I´d like to introduce Chloé. Chloé Therrien. She´ll spend the next 2 days with us. She´ll be our translator during the visit, which works out, because my Russian is rusty. Welcome, Chloé! Nice to meet you all. Hosting Russians for the first time. #Blessed Hey! We never officially met. - We´ll be working together. Simon. - Chloé. Martine sang your praises. Honestly, I know I was your last choice. My resume sucks. It´s my first contract. I´m shitting my pants. I almost turned it down, but I knew you were screwed. Don´t say that! You should put your best foot forward. I quit doing that a long time ago. When I was using, I was always lying to get money. - What? - Non-stop. Therapy taught me that the 6-year-old me was numbing herself, so I stopped using. Now I embrace my emotions. And I managed to get a job I´m semi-qualified for, so... But you speak Russian? Top notch! I learned when I was young. I fell for a Russian at 17. Followed him to Novosibirsk. Then I found out he had a wife and kids. It destroyed me. So, I ran away and joined a hacker squad in Razdol´noye. I fell in love with a skinhead with a wooden leg. He sold drugs. I started using and selling. He cheated. I was destroyed, again. You don´t stop! I came home and went to rehab. That´s when I met my shrink. Fell in love with him. He lost his license. I lost all of my self-esteem, so I started sleeping with a lot of people, until I shut myself in and read everything by Philip K. Dick, a sci-fi genius! I was obsessed. Read it all, saw it all. That passion helped me cut out all romantic relationships. I´ve been clean and celibate for 2 years. Now I translate Russian. And you? What´s your flaw? My flaw? What defines you on an emotional level? I´ve never told anyone this... I... In life, I... My parents were abusive. They were very abusive. My God! They were cruel, violent. I still carry that with me. - I´m sorry, I... - Yeah. I feel for you. That´s rough. It feels good to talk about it! Good! I´m glad. Look, you seem like fun. Wanna grab a drink? No, not at all! I just told you! Yeah, but... I´m sorry if I gave you the wrong impression. But no, thank you. You seem great, but I need to be on my own. Let´s keep it professional. I respect that. You´ll help me with the Russians? Wear a nice shirt, at least? I´ll wear this shirt. You´re union head, not Uncle Marcel at the hoedown. The factory´s survival doesn´t depend on my shirt, OK? The survival of style itself depends on that shirt. It´s ugly as shit! This is nice. I missed this. I missed you! Me too. I like you when you´re like this. I like this Simon. Everyone does. You guys ready for tomorrow? I think so, but thank God I´m there. The office is a complete madhouse, an insane asylum. Seemed fine last week. I met the translator who´s gonna work with the Russians. I´ve never met anyone like her. The things she told me... She has zero filter. Plus, she´s super cute. She was obviously very attracted to me. She has a huge crush on me. - I can imagine. - It was magnetic. I´m gonna take it slow. Yeah. Wait till I close the Russian deal. Please. I invented that. It only works in English. It rhymes. Yeah. - Where´s the restaurant? - We just have to stop here first. Why? Trust me! What is this? Where are we? I want you to know: Everyone loves you, Simon. Nice surprise! Sit down, Simon. It´s not my birthday. This is an intervention. - What? - An intervention. We´re giving you an ultimatum. I don´t even do drugs. You´ve lost touch with reality. The lies have to stop. Was this your idea? That doesn´t matter. I made the Facebook group. It was easier than I thought. Let us help you quit lying. I don´t lie! - Yes, you do! - It has to stop! Thanks! It´s nice to-- Sit down and listen to the people who love you. This is important. Simon, my son... For years, we´ve hoped things would change. But they´re getting worse. You´re turning everyone against you! We know what you say about us. Stop saying I´m depressed. I´m doing fine! I´m just a little tired. I´m allowed. You told me you were a war hero in Afghanistan. That you trained in hand-to-hand combat. - I never said that. - Yes, you did. That you had PTSD after the war in Afghanistan. - Simon! You worked in a food truck. - In Valcartier! At the Valcartier water slides! Yeah. I´d like to go there someday. I don´t have a gambling problem. I´ve never been to the casino! I never said that. Last time I blinked, you told everyone I was narcoleptic. I never said that! We´re talking. You didn´t win Dance Dance 2019! You haven´t memorized War and Peace. You´re not a Dostoevsky expert. - You can´t even spell his name! - Tolstoy wrote War and Peace. Who cares? He doesn´t even know him. You lie about why you´re late. - Your phone died. - No reception. - Elevator´s broken. - A flat tire. One? 16 flats in 8 months! Or a burst pipe. Yeah, a lot of burst pipes. - You didn´t build an orphanage in Kenya! - You didn´t almost make the NHL! You haven´t slept with 33 women. That one´s true. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. You said Phil has the worst luck in the world. You tell everyone I´m a loser! I didn´t call you a loser. I said bad things always happen to you. I don´t know why he still talks to you. Contrary to what you told God knows who, Virginie doesn´t want you! - I´m not into you. - A little? I told my sister not to date you. I took you out of the Secret Santa. No gifts for you! - What? - She likes honest men. I hope someday, you experience being real with someone. - I love you. - You too. Simon, you tell everyone you had a miserable childhood. We never beat you! We should have. Come on! You don´t understand the effect your lies have on people. I´m done with you. You don´t have a girlfriend. Your co-workers hate you. Your family avoids you. It´s a nightmare having a brother who lies. I´ve spent my whole life cleaning up your messes. I´m an upstanding man, and it pisses me off, ´cause sometimes, I´d like to lie too... and say you´re not my twin brother. They´re twins? I thought that was another lie. You´ll tell one lie too many. And something terrible will happen. Terrible! It´ll be too late. I saw every one of you today. And you all acted normal. And I´m the liar. You got together to make up these crazy stories. Feel better? Good! Have a good night. 33 women... I should have put less money in the meter. ...but my factory builds combat drones their army can fly remotely. Your job is intense! You get used to it. You have the power to stop World War 3! That´s fucked up! I have to be vigilant. Being a flight attendant must be turbulent! I serve coffee to people in uncomfortable seats. - Anything else? - No, I´m gonna go. So you´ll leave my girl alone? Come on! The old Steven would have thrown him through a window. Not New Steven. New Steven has control. Glad to meet New Steven. Steven had a tough childhood. Group homes... A lot of abuse. I´m so proud of him. Look at him now. Good job, Steven! Thanks. Thanks. But you seem cool. - Well, I... Yeah? - Yeah. Well, I... I haven´t always had it easy either. I don´t wanna... My parents were abusive, and... It all came out when I was in Afghanistan. Gimme your cash, you fucker! Shit, the Russians! Simon, I haven´t slept all night. I need to talk to you. You OK? I wanted to hear your voice. You could have heard it yesterday. But no! You were too busy shitting all over me! I miss you. Miss me? We´re out of hot water! I have to see you. We´re out of towels too! What is this? I´m late, so... I´ll die if I don´t see you. There´s no hot water, dammit! And the fucking rod broke off! Is that Phil? No, I don´t need insurance. I don´t get it! I took the first shower. Why isn´t there any hot water? This isn´t a good time. Good morning! Montreal is gridlocked. Bridges and tunnels are backed up. You´re looking at a 5-hour commute-- Mr. Aubert? What are you doing here? You called about the transformer? I let myself in. No, I didn´t... Sir? I´m here for the burst pipe. What burst pipe? I´m late. The valves are in the bathroom. What´s going on? The cable guy is out front too. You´ll all have to come back. - I´m trying to sleep! - What are you doing here? I knew this moment would come. You want me out. I´ll let you have your moment. He´s a co-worker. I don´t know why he´s here. I´m going through a hard time. Simon is putting me up. I´m a burden to everyone! How long has this... Help me. I´m out of towels. Out of towels? I was gonna take a shower! What am I gonna do? What´s going on? Hey, sexy Simon! Where are you? I won´t make it to the airport. Is France there? I just want to take a shower! No. She said you´d greet Oleg. He looks like Agent Smith from The Matrix. This is gonna be fun. What do I tell them? Tell them something came up. Mr. Aubert! It´s a basic necessity! Today´s the big day! I´ll meet you at the hotel. Sorry, but who are you? I´m Gaël´s social worker. He´s moving in today! Did you forget? What? - I fixed it. - Cute kid! Is this a joke? He´s your foster child! Just so we´re clear, what room is he taking? - You have the wrong Simon Aubert. - You scoundrel! I´m in no position to take care of a kid. Gaël, this is for your own good. You look like a cute little elf. You´ll find someone better. You´re a monster! Everyone out, please! I won´t make it to the hotel. Let´s meet at the office. - Are you OK? - Sorry, I have another call. So, what should we do about this? About what? Us, silly! Our love! We can´t hide anymore. I bet on the wrong horse with Phil. I had a stallion, but I married a packhorse. It´s never too late for true love. Virginie, I... We have to spare Phil´s feelings. The thought of hurting him tears me apart. He´s such a good guy! So sensitive. I never wanted... When... soul mate... ...gift from destiny. bird... ostrich... fly... so much... Yesterday wasn´t enough? Now you´re ganging up to ruin a big day? (...) That´s just great! Set my house on fire while you´re at it! I´ll never let you go. We´re so in love! I just charged it! She took me out of the Secret Santa. Now we´re soul mates. That make sense to you? Are these books and veggies yours? You´re in on this? You guys all talked? Well, message received! You hate me! Fine. What are you talking about? And this... It´s... What is this? Your scars. From that landmine in Kandahar Market. Kandahar? What? We´re late to meet the Russians. - You want to let them down? - No, I... You want everyone to lose their job? No! So take a deep breath and let´s get to the office. Let´s call an Uber. It´ll take too long. Let´s take your motorcycle. I don´t have a motorcycle! I don´t have a motorcycle. Dammit! Good to see you. I have butterflies in my stomach! Usually, I´m into big, beefy dudes, but... Thank you. Anyway, Oleg is not happy. We´ve been waiting an hour. Mr. Medvedev, hello! Simon Aubert. Sorry I´m late. It´s nice to meet you. He´s saying: ‟Yeah, smile, you son of a whore. No wonder America is bankrupt, you fucking idiot.” Now he switched to a slang dialect. ‟Eat shit. Fuck your family up the ass.” Not sure about the ass stuff, but it´s close. Thanks, I get the gist. Something about a goat. He-- I´m good! You´re right to be angry. You don´t deserve this. It´s insulting to be kept waiting. But the strongest of all warriors are Time and Patience. One must put himself in everyone´s position. To understand all is to forgive all. Leo Tolstoy! I´d keep apologizing, but even the strongest current cannot add a drop to a cup that is full. He´s impressed you learned Tolstoy. So am I! Shall we visit your offices? With pleasure. Don´t give up, Mr. Medvedev! The Avionech team can´t wait to meet-- France Gauthier will meet us downstairs. Get them out of here, fast. We´ll meet by the entrance. You´re not with Mr. Medvedev? He´s waiting downstairs. He´s not very nice. Martine, go get France. Would it kill you to say please... Just be professional. It´s her narcolepsy. Robin, would you... I´m fed up. Don´t touch me! What are you doing? Let´s do shots! What´s going on? Shots? You´re the boss! Yeah, I´m the boss! I had to get the Russians out! No! Oh God! It´s a madhouse! I saw a chicken! A live chicken! Stop it! Oleg´s here? He´s waiting! Got any gum? ‟I´m tired of life. I feel useless and alone. I wish I was dead.” It´s ‟were dead.” Rewrite it. I´m such a bitch! Gift bags for the Russians! Let´s take a dump in one! - No! - Let´s shit in a bag! We´re not doing that! Instead of perfume and a card, it´ll be shit! We´re not shitting in the bags! Let´s go. Just one bag! I get the joke. You got me. Can we stop the Candid Camera reboot and circle back when the Russians are gone? What are you talking about? Wait! This´ll help. Oh no! My bra is beige! Let´s make a good impression. Think of the factory workers. That contract is a long shot. - What? - I´m gonna tell you a secret. I´ve laid off thousands of people. I fired my own father. And the shareholders were happy. When they´re happy, I get a raise. Meanwhile, I´m all alone. I have dreams, Simon! Big dreams. But I keep them all inside. Mr. Medvedev! Nice to meet you. Avionech has everything you´re looking for, and you won´t regret your choice. Fuck! We forgot the bags. - Why English? - Translate, Chloé! Don´t translate. He doesn´t understand a word. Let´s go see the minister. I´ve never received such a welcome. - Good! - I´m going back to my hotel. I have to re-evaluate things. The journalists are there. I´ve wasted enough time. Take me back to my hotel. Oleg, be reasonable. Extremes are not good in anything. Wisdom needs no violence. Yeah, I got it. He just made a sexist comment. You motherfucker! Chloé, calm down! France! Christ! I called him a moose. It could have gone either way, but they´re laughing. Let´s go see the minister. Duke Ellington´s Take the A Train always makes things better. Holy shit! I know Duke Ellington songs? When did I become a jazz expert? Come on! I can´t control my hands! Fuck! What do I do? I don´t know. What´s happening? You´re really good! Help me! I´m losing it! What´s going on? JEAN LEON - MINISTER FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT When re-elected, we´ll sign many new contracts, like the one to renew Aeroskaya´s fleet. Myriam Lambert, BTV. Two weeks before the election... why make such a fuss about an unsigned contract? The contract will be signed. The following film is called Quebec, Land of Opportunities. Boring-ass film! That was fun! Lots of laughs. Yes, very funny. Time to go beddy-bye! Later! You OK? I´m not crazy, right? Does any of this seem weird to you? France wasn´t this hot mess yesterday. She was wasted. She asked me to trade bras. And the office was total chaos. It was like an orgy in Gomorrah. - Come on! - It´s going up in flames. Look, my skin was smooth yesterday. I didn´t see. You were wearing a shirt. How did that happen? Just like that! After some random kung-fu moves. You´re like Doug Quaid in Total Recall. Your memory is all fucked up. - You lost me. - Come on! Total Recall. Arnold´s memory implant goes to shit, so we don´t know what´s real. The chick with three tits! Enough about Total Recall! Something´s wrong. Charlie! My dog! - That´s normal to you? - It´s the third abduction this month. Damn! Weren´t you on Degrassi? Did you see that dog get sucked up? Crazy, right? My daughter never got over her bulldog´s abduction. Are you drunk? It´s impossible. Dogs don´t get sucked up by beams of light! Have you all gone freaking nuts? Ease up on the vodka! He´s questioning Avionech´s competence. Honestly, so am I. This is kind of a shitshow. Not you. You´re cool. We´ll make sure the rest of your visit goes well. You have 4 hours until you leave for Saint-Valran. Enjoy. Thank you. No! Come on! Why? What´s going on? Why? What´s going on? Look at me. You´re gonna go to the ER. You´re having a psychotic episode. I know, but the workers are counting on me. You´re in no state to help anyone. You´re right. I´m losing it. Therapy will help. It allowed me to find my inner child and fight ‟the enemy within”. It was fun! Yes, I think I need help. Let´s go. Thanks, Martine. I see him. What did you do, Simon? What? What did you do? That´s Phil, my twin brother. - Your twin brother? - I´ll kill you. Your parents must mix you up. I´ll fuck you up. Shit! All day, the sky´s been falling on me, literally! All my cards were cloned. A bird flew right into my face. There was traffic on my street, in Saint-Valran! I hit every red light on my way here, red lights that didn´t exist yesterday! I suddenly have the worst luck in the world! Every lie you´ve told about me has come true! What did you do? I´m so happy. What? Happy? Everything is fucked today, and no one else seems to notice! I was gonna have myself committed. But you see it too! We´re not crazy, Phil! My life is upside down. I have a burst pipe. France is a lush. Robin is suicidal. And Virginie is in love with me. No, she isn´t! Look, she sent me a tit pic. She wouldn´t have yesterday. It´s not just the lies about me. All your lies are coming true. That´s what´s going on! Life is teaching you a lesson. Simon is a compulsive liar. His lies are coming true. I´m not a compulsive liar. I exaggerate. It´s not my lies. It´s you. It´s your lies! Our lies? The lies you all pinned on me! - Fuck you! Your lies! - No, your lies! Shut up! OK! Calm down, Gallagher brothers! Can we just have a conversation? - Who´s she? - The translator. - The translator sucks. - Hi, Phil! I´m Chloé. I was taking your brother to the psych ward. Wanna come? That´s for my wife´s tits! I´m not in a psychosis. - I think you are. - No, this isn´t normal. I can recite Tolstoy! It´s impressive. He didn´t know Tolstoy yesterday. ‟All reasoning about love destroys it.” Tolstoy. ‟Pure sorrow is as impossible as pure joy.” Tolstoy again. ‟Sow, sow, and God´s seed will grow.” He never reads. ‟None is as dear as one´s own mother.” - Shut up! - Mr. Aubert! It´s so nice to see you. We´ve prepared your usual suite. - What suite? - The most spacious one! Spacious? So, everything was different yesterday? - Everything´s changed. - It´s pretty far-fetched. - Simon has told so many lies... - No! ...they´re starting to come true! My lies are coming true? Sure. I have $1,000 in my pockets. I can walk through walls! Come on! I walk through walls! Can you explain why I´m the world´s unluckiest guy? Don´t believe me? Throw something at me, hard. Why? I don´t want to-- Go ahead! - Really? - Yeah. Shoot! - OK, ready? - Yep! Sorry! What are the chances you´d hit me from that distance? Right in the face too! I played baseball. Simon, you never played baseball! Go! Chloé, aim next to me. Still not convinced? Throw the whole buffet! Starting to believe me? It´s not norm-- Jesus! Sorry! I still wasn´t sure. Admit that it´s statistically impossible. Aim for the wall! OK, yeah. - It´s weird. - A nightmare. The universe is punishing Simon. You´ve told, what, 10 lies a day for 30 years? 100,000 lies in 30 years. Sure. By your logic, the lies Simon told before today are coming true? It´s not logical. Maybe we woke up in a parallel universe. And I´m the crazy one. Each lie is like a blow to the fabric of our universe, right? Yes. Physicist Hugh Everett would be proud of me here: A high concentration of lies in one time-stream could affect the space-time continuum. Basically, it could alter the multiverse, creating a new universe where multiple realities meld into one another. Simon might have created a new reality where his lies are true, in turn affecting the entire universe. It´s a bit much. At first, I was like, maybe, but then, no. - When did you start lying? - He´s always lied. I don´t lie. He´s never admitted to one goddamn lie. Even when we were kids! ‟I scored 4 goals in hockey! I got 100% in math! I have a Playboy in my locker! I didn´t push Mrs. Carter!” My parents cared for seniors. He pinned all his mistakes on me. He told me the craziest stuff! He told me our neighbor was a serial killer. You´re still on that? My whole life, I´ve been caught up in his lies. That´s why you see what´s happening too! You belong to the same universe. You´re cosmic twins! I don´t lie, Phil. Let it go. The serial killer thing was a long time ago. Wait, Simon! Your parents! You told Phil your neighbor was a serial killer. That means in our new reality... Our neighbor might be hacking Mom and Dad to bits! That wasn´t a lie, just a dumb kid thing. Call them! No answer. That´s weird. Wait! I need you to go check on my parents. - Well, I can´t. - It´s a matter of life and death! - I would, but I really can´t. - But-- She can´t go. Guys, I can´t come! I´m taking care of the Russians. I´ll travel with them tonight. See you at the factory tomorrow? I didn´t expect to fix a crack in the space-time continuum, but it´s a fun challenge. Thanks. No problem. Shit! That was weird. I´m sorry! It was, like, automatic. I´m really sorry. No, it´s fine. Tell Chloé you lied about her huge crush on you. I never said that. At the bar, before the intervention. Can´t you see all your lies are coming true? We don´t know that. Admitting you have a problem is the first step to recovery. Forget recovery! I just want Virginie to stop texting me. - The drive here was rough. - I expected worse. We won´t get far in that. I´ll call an Uber. With my luck, we´ll get a speed demon, someone with road rage or worse! Have you boys filled out your organ donor card? Of course not! Well, I did. Unfortunately, I lost it the next week. But they know me at the hospital. That´s where I had my second operation. On an empty stomach too! I hate that. Because breakfast, a nice breakfast with a nice coffee, I just love it. I don´t drink it all, of course. Nowadays, when you order coffee in a restaurant, they complicate everything with 15,000 coffees! It´s so confusing! And they use so much cream. You could bathe in it! I tell them: ‟I don´t want a bath. I want a coffee!” Oh Lordy... Nowadays, I eat oatmeal. Gruel, as my mother called it. We ate it with molasses. You ever try molasses? Of course not. That´s what we ate back then. It was cheap and good. We liked it. My father spackled the walls with it! That´s what my grandson says. He´s a pharmacist. Wonderful flautist too! He´s gay, but I accept it. He was so good to me after my third operation! Did I tell you about that operation? Christ, you did! Thank you, ma´am. My pleasure. Fingers crossed for the Russians tomorrow! He could have killed them already. Fucking asshole! You´re gonna break the door! So good to see you! Let go of me, you sissy! Philou! Lovely to see you! Why didn´t you answer the phone? We saw it was Simon´s number. We thought: ‟Fuck him!” Him again. I told you not to answer. Phil, sweetie! - We won´t stay long. - You. Shut it! We just wanted to check in on you. Did you have to bring assface? Hungry? I don´t know, we-- Do you ever shut your fucking mouth? Thanks, Mom. Hey, Mr. Vegan. When I´m at your house, I eat your goddamn beet salad, so... Of course! My knife doesn´t cut. Want us to chew for you, princess? I don´t know what´s with me. It looks good, but it´s like my body-- Your body needs a good beating. Damn knife! It looks really good, but deep down, I feel like hummus. - Hummus? - Yes, hummus. We have hummus. Go get the kitty litter. - Come on! - Shut up, asshole! He´s trying to provoke you. Your face disgusts me, but I´m still eating. Don´t talk to me like that. I can´t take it. ‟I can´t take it.” I won´t put up with this. Don´t talk back to your mother! What the... Enough. Go to your room! And don´t come out! Good for nothing! - No one loves you! - We hate you! Die! That´s a mess I´d gladly clean up. Thanks. That´s great. Simon! How´s it going? Are your parents alive? Yeah, but it´s like they´re possessed. Possessed? They´re being really mean. ´Cause you said they were abusive. Yeah. How are you? Good! We´re at the Saint-Valran hotel. I stopped France from kissing Oleg, so we´re good. Glad to hear it. You sound sad. Want me to come over? Yeah! Yes. Unless that´s weird. - Is that weird? - It´s not weird at all. Not even a little. Just to chill. I don´t wanna be weird. Nothing weird about it. I´ll come. Cool! - Who is it? - Chloé. It´s 554 2nd Ave. The old folks´ home. See you soon! She wanted to come. It´s not weird. It´s super weird. All of this is weird. What are you doing? I´m not moving. I´m not touching anything. And I hate you. You think I´m having fun? Think I wanna be stuck in this universe forever? Are your parents around? They´re not answering. Watch out! My car battery needs a boost. - Your dad has cables in the garage. - Or maybe in his car. Ah, the hell with it. Lock the door! Don´t touch the handle! Stop touching things! Fuck off! Lean on the handrail. - Why? - Do it! - No. - Touch it! - Go fuck yourself! - Fucking touch it! Don´t do anything! Don´t move! I´m gonna get Mom and Dad. Don´t move, OK? We´ll get an ambulance. Mom, Dad, call an ambulance! Stay calm. Don´t close your eyes! - My brother... - Just breathe, slowly. I just wanna say one thing. When you wrapped your legs around his neck and flipped him around... I was like: ‟That´s the sickest move ever.” I´m proud of you. You´re OK. Look, breathe... But I´m not OK. You´re gonna be fine. - I´m cold. - That´s normal. You´re OK. - Don´t leave me alone. - I won´t. - Don´t leave me. - I won´t. Mom! Don´t move. It´s my fault. I shouldn´t have said the neighbor was a serial killer. It was a lie, and I´m sorry. Thanks for the cables, Georges! You´re OK? - Yeah. I don´t get it. - How is that possible? Wait! Wait, wait, wait! You... You admitted you lied about the neighbor. I think you brought us back into our reality! Yes! Paul was never a killer. He never chased after us. So we resequenced the... The multi... the multi-whatever. We resequenced the multi-whatever! - I don´t have back luck! - No! - Virginie doesn´t love you! - Nope! We resequenced the multi-whatever! Resequenced! - Sequenced what? - The multi-whatever! - Say what? - In your face, multi-whatever, galaxy... Wait. - What? - Your scars! They´re still there. - Why? - I don´t know. - What are you doing? - Wait. Crafts? Really? Hang on. We´ll have to undo your lies one at a time. 100,000 lies. Stop saying 100,000. We´ll start with Afghanistan. I never said I was in Afghanistan. You have scars and... Where´d you learn those moves? Come on! - Come on, what? - Come on! I was never in Afghan... I was never in Afghanistan. It´s not true. It was a lie. It´s not working anymore? Simon! There´s a girl here! It´s fucking late for guests! Your lie about Mom and Dad. Again? Come on! I said Mom and Dad were cruel. It´s not true. It was a lie. We´re talking to you, idiot! Why isn´t it working? - Asshole! - My parents weren´t cruel. - Shithead! - I had a happy childhood. We wrote you out of the will! We put you up for adoption! You won´t be our son! My parents weren´t abusive! I lied! Wait! You never told me they were abusive. But you did tell me the neighbor was a serial killer. I have to admit the lie to the person I told it to? - Maybe. - A little too on the nose. Hey, idiot, are you deaf? You have a guest! My parents never abused me. It was a lie. Fucking freak! - Why won´t it work? - I dunno! I told you my parents abused me. It´s not true. I don´t know why I said that. It´s a lie. Hold me back. I´m gonna clobber him! Treat yourself! I gave birth to the Antichrist! Shut up! My parents never hit me. I made it all up. I´m sorry! - You said you were sorry. - Yes. Like with the neighbor! That´s it! You have to apologize! - Chips? - Yes, I´m peckish. We know how to resequence the... The multiverse? The multiverse! Yes! You just figured it out? Crazy! Has anything changed? The what? The multiverse. You never watch sci-fi with me. We undid the lie about the neighbor. - How? - I have to find the person I lied to. Then I admit it was a lie. Then he apologizes, and bam! Everything goes back to normal. I had to apologize to everyone when I got clean. It´s called making amends. What´s the multiverse? Parallel universes, with many Claires and Georges with different destinies! In another universe, there´s another Georges and Claire, or a Georges with a another woman. Who is she? I don´t know. It´s the other Georges. Where is this other Georges who´s cheating on me? He´s not cheating! He doesn´t know you. But I´m sure there´s a universe where a Georges cheated. - I knew it. - They´re parallel universes! OK, this is important. Simon has a lot to tell you. I told you Phil has bad luck and bad things always happen to him. It´s not true. It´s... - A lie? - Yeah. You never told us that. No? I never said Phil was a bit of a loser? No, not that. Dammit! You never told them I was a loser! Why didn´t you tell them? You should be happy! - Who did you tell? - Dominic, I think. Let´s go tell him I don´t have back luck. It´s late. I don´t care! I want my life back! - Watch your tone! - Yeah, tone! Admitting your faults is tiring. Simon needs a break from resequencing the universe. Tomorrow, 8:00 a.m. We´re starting with Mom and Dad. You´ll undo the lies you told them, then we´re going to Dominic´s. I want my life back! Want me to call you a cab? I could chill a little longer. Unless Simon would rather be alone. It would help me unwind. I´ll call her a cab later. Too tired to resequence my shit, but you still have energy to chill with Chloé? Even though we know... You can´t stop, huh? Even if you´re destroying lives. But all that matters is Simon! You stepped in dog poop. They don´t even have a dog. That´s my cue. Good night! So, you didn´t meet two versions of my parents? Just one. That´s so fucked up. What do you remember about all this? Your compulsive lying altered our reality. Everything seems normal to me, but it´s totally new to you. It´s really weird, but I decided to help you, ´cause for one, I think it´s really cool, and two, I think you´re sexy as hell. Thanks. I think you´re really... You´re really pretty. This sucks, but I gotta go. I´ll call a cab. What´s wrong? I can´t stay. It´s dangerous. Why is it dangerous? If I stay, we´ll fuck like animals. We won´t fuck like animals. I know this game! We´ll fuck like two big, dumb animals. I´ll get attached. We´ll destroy each other. No, we won´t! It happens to me every time. Why is that? I could explain the Freudian Electra complex, a girl´s psychosexual competition with her mother for her father´s affection, but the more mundane version: ugly divorce, absent father, distant mother, low self-esteem, you know. It´s boring as hell. It´s not boring at all. We´re just sleeping. That´s it. Yeah, no problem. Make a move, and I´ll kick your ass. For real. Careful. I know all of Bam Bam Bigelow´s moves. Sorry! Sorry! - No, it´s me. I... - No. It´s me. Everything I touch. Simon, your silence is killing me. Simon the champion. You were so cute! That´s not what happened. We had a bad game and lost 8-1. OK, but... It was my first lie. Simon, your dad has to help Mrs. Dubé. She fell. I´m taking your brother to the ER for his fever. Mrs. Dubé is OK, but Mr. Goderre ran off again. I´m on it. I´m taking your brother to the ER. Tidy up and do your homework, please. You´ll make your brother´s lunch tomorrow. We´re short-staffed. - Are you OK? - Great! Good night. I scored 4 goals today. I scored 4 goals, including the winning one. 4 goals! That´s really something! I´m proud of you, buddy. You´re our champ! My dad was so proud. And you liked the feeling. I guess so, ´cause I did it... 100,000 more times. Have a good day, sweetie! We forgot our lunches. Sorry, I´m really... We forgot more than our lunches. No, I... We forgot about us. It´s just lunch. It´s more than lunches! Our journey has come to an end. Our journey hasn´t ended. We had some good years, but... No, no buts! You and I are... (...) Our hikes... We took so many hikes in the woods. (...) (...) Thanks. Go to work. Everything will be fine in an hour. It´ll be fine. Trust me. Go to work. Forget this. Forget me, Phil. You´re kidding me! Hey, soul sista! Where were you? I spent the night with Simon. Nothing happened. Nothing? No, nothing! It was crazy. He didn´t even eat you out a little? - No eating. - None? We just talked. It felt really good! It was sweet and tender. It was perfect. Perfect! Sweet and tender... Sweetness and tenderness aren´t something I... And my boss isn´t a lush. That´s also a lie. Let´s do shots to celebrate love! I´m sorry. That´s a nice story, but we have to go. We´re meeting the prime minister. I´m sorry. I´ll get Oleg. Thank you. The office isn´t really a madhouse. My assistant isn´t narcoleptic. And my co-worker Robin never stayed with me. He´s not depressed. No problem at all! You´re still mad? Virginie just left me. You know it´s not real. I know, but it still hurts. I saw Chloé leave this morning. She was supposed to go to the hotel! You´re bullshitting me again! We just slept. Chloé isn´t actually in love with you. ´Cause a girl could never actually like me, right? Tell me you lied, and you´ll find out. Well, you said Dominic had a gambling problem. Of course! I´m fed up. I don´t have the cash. I was expecting someone else. I really need to talk to you. I told you Phil has bad luck. - I´m busy. - Make time! And I was never in Afghanistan. My scars are gone! And the sprinklers are off! Now the lie about Dominic. Hope it works long-distance. Everything OK, Simon? Yes. Listen, Martine. Dominic´s gambling problem... I was lying. Sorry. My truck is back! Thank you! Who did you tell Virginie was in love with you? Sandra. I´d like to introduce Sandra Simard, union representative. On behalf of the workers, welcome. I want to talk to Simon alone. We´ll go see Sandra, and everything will be fine. No, I have to talk to him. Simon, love came knocking on my door. But it wasn´t the man I was expecting. I realized I need someone like you! Someone who will surprise me, someone who will save me from my boring life. Someone... not toxic, but not completely reliable. Someone with loose morals. Dammit, what´s the word? - An asshole. - Yes, an asshole! - Come on! - But a good one. Sandra! Simon, that´s not what I meant! - Simon has something to say. - Hi, Sandra! Hi, Simon. Phil, what are you doing? Hey, you there... Simon! I´m sorry! I don´t know what came over me. Virginie doesn´t love me. It was a lie. I´m sorry. Hey, you there... What´s up, Chloé? You look like a guy who just undid a lie. Can we talk? What are you doing? I´m just checking if Virginie is OK. I´m glad we didn´t do anything yesterday. I told you it was possible. I didn´t know you could feel this way without doing anything. We could do nothing again sometime. Next Friday, maybe? What´s wrong? I can´t do this. It´s a lie. What is? I told Phil that... you had a crush on me. That means... Shit! That´s why... - I´m sorry. - Really? I don´t know why I lie. I´ve been doing it for 30 years. Ever since you told your dad you scored 4 goals? Yeah. Shit! Sorry, it´s dumb. Not at all. I´m embarrassed. An introspective guy who´s in touch with his emotions... There´s nothing sexier. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. It´s very, very sexy. Like, very sexy. It´s still a lie. Maybe we don´t have to undo this one? Would it be so bad? It´s crazy. We only kissed! For, like, half an hour! Still, we only kissed! We´re proud of our cutting-edge equipment. Thank you for your visit, Mr. Medvedev. Let´s proceed to the finishing area to meet the prime minister and the press. Security, Code 23! Attention! Intruders in Hangar 14. The drones! - Drones? - What drones? Gray Eagles for the US Army. Yes, I was hoping we´d see them. We don´t make drones. We´ve been making them for 15 years. Not only are the Russians spies, but my factory builds combat drones their army can fly remotely. My God! Systems have been infiltrated. Go check it out! They´ve taken control of the drones. Move it, everyone! Let´s get out, guys! Fucking drones! Shit! - Who´d you tell that lie to? - A girl in a bar. - Who? - No idea! Let go of me! What´s going on? - They´re spies! I get it now! - Get what? Why they came! They´ve signed with the Brazilians. I never told anyone that! You didn´t know! The Russians were never gonna sign? This was all a show? Yes, but who cares? They´re spies! They´re spies! Mr. Prime Minister, stay in the car. - My love! - I love you so much! Combat drones made by Quebec company Avionech... - What is it? - Look! ...have been taken over by the Russian Intelligence Service and have just crossed the American border. One of the drones has collided with a commercial plane transporting hundreds of passengers. Washington has just been bombed, with thousands of casualties. American nuclear warheads are now flying toward Moscow. I can´t die without telling you this. I never stopped loving you, but... 2 years ago, I had an affair with Sandra. It was purely physical. I skipped yoga to see her. But it´s over. I realized I´m 100% hetero. You´re the love of my life. That wasn´t me. Who´s the girl you lied to about drones? I can´t remember! I can´t die without telling you... I gambled away our life savings. But I won them back! When I said I was volunteering with homeless kids, I was at the casino. But everything´s OK now. I joined a group. You´re the love of my life. Oh my God! You have to think harder, ´cause the Third World War is-- That´s it! The Third World War. You have the power to stop World War 3! - You´ll leave my girl alone? - Steven! Her boyfriend´s name was Steven. He worked at... We´re closed. I have to talk to Steven. Or give me his number. I could stop the-- Steven? Steven can´t talk. His girlfriend was in the plane crash. Tell Steven I´m sorry. What´s wrong? The girl I lied to was in the plane crash. That means the girl... Did you tell that lie to anyone else? Are you sure? Because this is a world war. I can´t undo the lie about drones. So we´re prisoners of this universe? We´re gonna die? One last thing. I have to say it. I poach. I´m a poacher. I trap rabbits and kill them in the woods. I´m a poacher. I like to trap rabbits for sport. I have an Instagram account full of dead-rabbit pics. I know it´s weird. I know it´s against your values, but... You´re the love of my life. Virginie, stop it. - I hate myself. - That´s pointless. I´m an egotistical monster. I take and take. I´m the queen of all monsters. Virginie, please! Oh shit, the queen! That´s it! - What? - We have to kill the queen. Like in Aliens. The big monster, the boss, the Xenomorph Queen. If you kill the queen, the other aliens can´t reproduce. If you undo the lie that spawned all the others, you could undo everything. What was your first lie? - That I got 4 goals. - That was the second one. The first one spawned that lie and all the others. What is it? A lie you told yourself. - Myself? - Fuck, that´s deep! You understand this? - Why´d you say you got 4 goals? - I had a shitty game. I felt worthless. That´s it! ‟I´m worthless!” That´s the first lie you told. You felt worthless, so you made up a bunch of stuff. That´s your Xenomorph Queen! You weren´t worthless. You were just an 8-year-old looking for attention. You´re right. Now tell the 8-year-old Simon he wasn´t worthless. If I undo the first lie, you might not remember anything. We won´t have spent the night together. You won´t love me. It won´t change anything. I think you´re amazing. There´s no guarantee. It´s a real dilemma. No, it isn´t! We´re gonna die! He´s right. Imagine yourself at 8 years old. How do I do that? Imagine you´re alone in your room, convinced you´re worthless, and tell yourself it´s a lie. I can´t do it! You can do it! It´s easy! OK, close your eyes. Let yourself go. That´s good. Breathe. Breathe. Think about what you´d tell little Simon. I was just a kid. I was 8. I wasn´t worthless. I just didn´t believe in myself. I shouldn´t have thought that. It was a lie. I´m sorry. I´m sorry. Let´s welcome the prime minister of Canada! Thank you! Aeroskaya is the largest airline in Russia, with service to 49 countries. We´re honored they´ve chosen to partner with Canada to renew their fleet. We´re very confident we´ll be able to sign a deal. Before the elections? We´re talking about hundreds of quality jobs in my district. As you can imagine, it´s a priority for me. My ass! France said they signed with the Brazilians. - I know. - It´s all for show. The factory´s gonna close! All of Quebec is honored to do business with you. Fuck, look at him! He´s lying to everyone, right to their faces. I know! I´m the Mozart of bullshit. I think we found our Beethoven. We still have some minor details to settle, but rest assured, I´m on it! I´m on it. I am on it. Mr. Prime Minister, an inside source just told me that the contract to build Aeroskaya´s new fleet has already been signed... with a Brazilian company, Trempoderoso. We´re still in negotiations. We have a good chance of getting the contract. Why else would Mr. Medvedev be here? So it´s a coincidence that on this day, the minister of international affairs announced Canada´s plan to lift economic sanctions against Russia? Mr. Prime Minister, did you make a deal with the Russian government? In exchange for lifting sanctions? If the Russians would wait until after the elections to announce the deal with the Brazilian company? What is this? Let´s get out of here. I voted for you! Ms. Gauthier! Can you confirm that if the factory closes, your contract will be terminated with a golden parachute of $6-$7 million? $8 million. I think you all get it. There´s no contract. The factory´s closing. I´m sorry. Yikes! I´m really sorry. I saw you talk to the reporter. That took guts. I didn´t have a choice. I didn´t see it coming, but wow! What an end to that contract! Thanks! Everything went well for you the past couple days? I couldn´t have asked for a better first gig. Glad to hear it. The Russians were great. France was professional. I felt comfortable. And I have to say, Simon... - What? - It was all thanks to you. You were a great partner. You gave me confidence. Honestly, I´ve never had such good synergy in a job. I´m really happy. Thanks again. Yeah. So, do you want to grab a drink? I loved working with you, but I´m still taking a break from relationships. Don´t take it personally, but no. I´d rather not. I understand. OK, well... Basically, that means: ‟Have a nice life!” It´s a little more poetic. But yeah. Have a nice life! Thank you all for coming. I wasn´t receptive last time. I´m sorry. Also, Virginie, Phil, Dominic, Sandra, I´m really sorry about your jobs. And fuck Avionech. Yeah. I´m gonna try to earn back your trust. No more lies. Good job, Simon. - I should also tell you I quit my job. - What? Why´d you do that? I really need a break. Of course! You work hard. Actually, I´m not doing so good. Is it us? Things will get better. What´s wrong? I´m in love with Chloé. But she doesn´t love me. Not anymore. I hope you´re not depressed. But what are you gonna do for work? I rented a log cabin in the middle of nowhere. I´m bringing a pile of books. I´m unplugging. Why not wait a few months? We have a new CEO. We´ll need you for the transition. They accepted my resignation. Maybe you´ll have better synergy with your new boss. What do you mean? You deserve it! You´re a great assistant. We´ve always had good synergy. We have no synergy. But that´s my fault. Great! So, I suck, but it´s all your fault? I never said that. We´ll still grab a drink sometimes? For now, I need a complete break from work. We´re not just co-workers. Aren´t we friends? We´re co-workers who get along well. But real friends, I don´t think I have any. Eat shit. I´m also moving to a shack in the middle of nowhere. ´Cause I can´t pay my mortgage. Half of us just lost our jobs, and you´re telling us you´re depressed, but can afford to take a sabbatical? - Well... - Thanks a lot! Real classy! And you didn´t have to invite your ‟co-workers”. Why am I here if we don´t have synergy? To humiliate me? To brag about your break? - Do we have synergy? - Look... I´m not strong enough to have a depressed son. The last thing I needed to hear is that I don´t have any friends. - No... - Yeah! - A little narcissistic, are we? - Yeah, he´s a narcissist! - ‟Me, me, me!” - A real navel-gazer. You´re mad when he lies, offended when he´s honest. Make up your minds! It takes guts to admit your faults. Simon has come a long way. We should be proud of him. I´m proud of you. I´m proud to be your twin. Do we have synergy? Listen! Avionech´s board just announced a plan to lower their salary and dividends by 40%. Shareholders unanimously decided to accept lower returns on their shares to rehire workers laid off during the last rationalization while still remaining profitable. This gesture by the multinational Avionech is a first, and would allow over 5,000 workers in 3 countries to keep or return to their jobs. At the union meeting, I said... Avionech puts its workers first. It doesn´t just seek profit. It cares more about its workers than its shareholders. But didn´t we undo all your lies? Hey, I was just saying that. Let´s not test our luck on this one. Good luck unplugging. - What about you and Virginie? - What about us? You gonna stay together? Why wouldn´t we? Well, her secret garden, the casino, the poaching, the affair with Sandra. In my mind, it never happened. If we talk about it, it´ll become too real. It´ll take all the space in our relationship. You´ll keep it to yourself? Yep. But I did book us an Arctic Excursion. Three weeks of adventure and total discomfort. I´ll have to keep her from clubbing seals. In this spot, one year ago today, Avionech shareholders decided to redistribute a small part of their dividends to factory workers. This surprising gesture sparked an international movement, with massive demonstrations in every country forcing governments to draft legislation requiring multinational corporations to redistribute part of their profits to employees. That´s the end of our tour. During the fireworks, the Jacques-Cartier Bridge is completely closed to cars so that people can watch the show and enjoy spectacular views of the city. It´s amazing! Any questions? I have a question for the lady. I met Chloé a year ago. I´ve been thinking of her ever since. I learned Russian to impress her. My question is: ‟Can I talk to you for a minute?” That´s all the Russian I learned. It´s a hard language! I think about him sometimes too. Enjoy the rest of your trip. Thank you! Good luck, buddy! Hi! Hi! I know it´s completely crazy to show up like this a year after spending 2 days together, but I can´t stop thinking about you. Oh yeah? I mean, I think about other things too. I was depressed. I went to a cabin in the woods with a pile of books. It was boring as hell. I got depressed again. I did a road trip out west. I picked a shitload of apples. I had back pain, so I smoked pot with a bunch of Mexicans. I had a bad trip. I puked in a sombrero. But I learned some Spanish. Sure! I´m an honest man. I do a lot of self-reflection, and I´m getting better. And how are you? You said you were working on yourself. Are things improving? Yeah, slowly. I relapsed for a couple weeks, but then I watched Cosmos on Netflix. Let´s just say Neil deGrasse Tyson helps put things in perspective. I´m happy to hear that, ´cause... it´s up and down for me too. But things are good now. And they´d be even better if... if you´d finally agree to get a drink with me. Yeah, OK! - Yeah? - Let´s do it. OK, yeah. Yeah, let´s go! We´re still in danger. A new liar has emerged. These new lies are on the brink of crystallization. Again? Shit, man! What do we do? We must meditate once again to help this person. To find this person´s first truth. Chill. Where is this man? No. It´s not ‟he who lies like the wind.” It´s ‟she who lies like the wind.”
